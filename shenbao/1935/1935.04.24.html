<h3>婦除文盲與推行注音漢字</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>我國掃除文盲之運動不自今日起。實與維新興學以俱來。至今巳有三十年之歷史矣。光緒末年。淸廷籌備立憲。卽有分年設立簡易識字學塾之計劃。民國元年之臨時敎育會議。通過探用注音字母案。其議决案中。有一敎育宜普及。文字宜適用於一般人民。不得專為少數才俊計」之語。於是識字敎育有切實之基礎矣。「五四」運動之際。平民敎育運動盛極一時。掃除文盲之呼聲傳遍全國。國語敎育運動者宣傳注音字母亦不遺餘力。所惜政治未上軌道。推行難於得力。致效果甚微。</p>
<p>自國民革命運動勃興。以孫中山先生有　喚起民衆」之遺囑。識字運動遂列為黨政機關重要工作之一。十七年。中央規定下層工作綱領。識字運動赫然居首。十八年。中央宣傳部頒布識字運動宣傳綱要於先。國民政府敎育部制定識字運動計劃宣傳大綱於後。顧煌煌功令頒行以來。各省市雖巳先後舉辦。然實際上尙未能推行盡利。此亦母庸諱言者。是以最近中央再加督促。各省市又振作精神。咸謀切實進行。上海市政府業於本月十五日舉行擴大紀念週時。發布七月一日起全市總動員實施强迫敎育之辦法。並由市長領導全體宣誓以表决心。</p>
<p>吾人對政府當局此種再接再厲之精神。與堅决典奮之態度。固不勝欽佩。然懲於識字運動已經歷三十年而迄無相當成就。竊願主持識字運動者在今設計推行之際。熟慮識字運動不易成就之所以。定一根本解决之方法焉。</p>
<p>關於識字運動不易成就之所以。雖非一端。竊謂其最大癥結乃在我國文字之難敎難學。而打破此難點之要道。中央於改注音字母」名稱為「注音符號」之令文中巳有明白之指示。其文略謂。「考我國文字優點甚多。其缺點在少注音。不便於孩童及失學民衆之初步習練。所以日本輔漢文以假名。卽成為通俗最良之工具。」「敎育部前頒注音字母。……與假名相同。僅適注音。不合造字。……應改稱為注音符號。以副名實。惟其注音而已。並非造字。卽不必過省符號之數量。及多設拚音之條例。對於高深學問及重要契約。其聲類之平仄。義類之同異。仍皆由漢文負其分別之責。不必在注音符號上又加枝贅之分別。如此則僅僅簡單數十符號。知書者三日卽可熟識。卽可為師。失學者最多習之兼旬。卽可畢業。且用此數十符號。注國音可。注土音可。注於文字之旁可。單用而注出口中之語亦可。左宜右有。無音不可注。無語不可傳。卽予通俗敎育以至廣極速之效力也。」觀此可知注音符號實為識字運動成功之利器。惜乎近年之識字運動有此利器而未能充分使用耳。</p>
<p>近聞敎育部已採納國語統一籌備會之條陳。着手鑄造注音漢字銅模。將限令出版界編印小學課本。兒童讀物。民衆讀物。一律應用注音漢字。此舉如能實現。誠識字運動前途之福音也。惟敎部此項計劃發布以來。頗有非議之者。且為實行此項計劃而籌之經費又有限。不敷展布。此於推行前途或不無影響。吾人於此。以為此次各地踴躍奉行之大規模的識字運動。與敎育部正在着手之推行注音漢字計劃。應取得密切之合作。識字運動者對於推行注音漢字宜出全力以助其成。對於非議推行注音漢字之計劃者。可持「敎育宜普及。文字宜適用於一般人民。不得專為少數才俊計」之原則以答之。敎育部為使識字運動推行盡利起見。應擴大其推行注音漢字之計劃。以打破歷來識字運動不易成就之難關乃可。</p>

<h3>意阿糾紛的透視</h3>
<p>— （羅馬通信）</p>
<p>意大利國勢、就一方面看、可算是蒸蒸日上、大有與德法爭衡的趨勢、可是她國內的出產很少、特別是近代產業國家所必需的物資—媒鐵石油之類、所以她在國勢發展的另一面、失業人數由二三十萬增加到現在的百萬以上、對外貿易、也處於困難的地位、因此意大利必須尋覓出路、一則在海外開闢新的殖民地、一則借以制服她國內的矛盾、恰巧去年十一月二十三烏爾烏井（Ualual）和瓦爾特（Wardir）井附近發生了意阿國境軍隊衝突事件、自這件事情發生後、意國一面要表示大國的權威、一面要借此施展她的本事、換言之、就是刺激其國內的產業、</p>
<p>例如近年來世界貿易衰微、意國航行大西洋的商船也遭停航呃運、自意阿糾紛發生後、那些停航的船都一齊被動員、用作遠征軍的運送船、凡停職了的船員一律復職、各軍需品製造工廠、或有關於軍需的工廠、頓時活躍起來、都晝夜開工、汽車廠飛機廠定貨單擁擠不堪、意國政府幷且準備要總動員、假使阿比西尼亞眞要反抗的話、意大利眞像要以全力打她的樣子、但是阿國怎樣呢、阿國雖是非洲的小小獨立國家、她的面積祇有三十五萬平方英里、人口也祇七百餘萬、（有人估計為一千萬）全國鐵道總長祗四百八十七哩、然而能殻衝鋒陷陣的、到有二百萬人、他們雖然沒有近代的新式武器、可是民族性却慄悍無比、而且阿王「哈利塞拉西」（Haile　Selassi）對意阿衝突、雖表示願和平解决、却幷不放鬆軍事準備、當意軍動員赴東非時、阿王也下全國準備動員令、而且他自己宣吿作總司令、以皇太子殿軍監國用最大的犧牲精神、以保持其國士、意國於此也不能不略為顧忌、所以才接受和平、主張聽國聯的仲裁、而不立卽宣告開戰、</p>
<p>不過這中間還有一種不卽開戰的原因、就是英法意的綜錯關係、因為在一九〇六年十二月十三日英法意三國爲了阿比西尼亞問題、成立過以下的秘密諒解、（一）阿國是英法意三國的勢力範圍、（二）阿比西尼亞的領土保全、（三）三國共同保護彼此的利益、幷維持彼此問的機會均等、到一九一九年英國為開發「薩納湖」的水利、曾經承認意國有從意屬索莫利蘭與阿國問的縱斷鐵路建築權、沿鐵道的商業優先權、及其他經濟權利、法國在今年一月七日的羅馬恊定、也承認把法阿鐵道的股票讓兩三千股與意大利、據此好像英法意三國都能諒解似的、可是她們諒解的是「機會均等」、决不是任何一個國家單獨占據、</p>
<p>如今意國的企圖是預備以兵力征服阿此西尼亞、假設要由鐵道誰攻、就必須法國的同意、甚至要英國諒解、卽占領了「阿底斯亞巴巴、」（阿國京城）也不能算完全解决、何况意軍以近代組織的軍隊在多山的國境內、作純粹的人力馬力的運動、要與强悍的阿國騎兵作散漫的野戰、也覺得不大容易、所以意國儘管用威嚇的方法、使阿國屈服、同時又可以刺激意大利本身的工業、戰爭空氣雖濃厚、倒底不見得實現哩、（三月二十四日於羅馬）</p>

<h3>我做籃球裁判的哲學（二）</h3>
<p>— 美國達爾氏著錢一勤譯</p>
<p>立刻之判斷力　除以上所申述者外、裁判員更須有此重要之特性、即對於犯規之宣佈應立即迅速下準確之判决、凡有犯規即於宜佈、不得於數秒鐘後、方始施行、此並非謂犯規可以預料、或在實際犯規之一瞬間或數秒鐘前卽行宣佈、最要者、爲犯規必須成立、目必確見、始即嗚笛、</p>
<p>換言之、裁判員之腦海中、對於犯規之確否、或宜否宜佈、决無時間加以思索或爭辯、倘裁判員言其能任意執法嚴寬者、則必犯上述之事實無疑、</p>
<p>與此屬似者、爲一派批評家、其言曰、「倘係無意犯規或遠離比賽中心之犯規、均可任其過去、不加宣佈、」茲引某報之評論曰、「在比賽緊張之際、球員之無意犯規、實難避免、而裁判員必欲宣判、於情於理、殊有未合、彼等裁判實無常識之可言、」又曰、「遠離比賽中心之無意犯規、而裁判加以宣佈、實足以延誤比賽之行進、然則裁判員見犯規時將停止而自相爭辯、抑係眞實犯規乎、抑係有意犯規乎、係離比賽中心乎、係分數，落後之一隊犯規乎、若然余宣佈犯規有所區別乎、抑目下就如此執行或俟比賽接近時再加嚴厲宣判乎、</p>
<p>比資中裁判員切不可片刻輕易放鬆、因不論如何容易或一面倒之比賽、隨時均可緊張、倘因猶豫或未確、而裁判對於犯規自問是否應加以宣判、則其必隨即非卻管理比賽之能力、而不轉瞬即將置自身於狼狽之地位、須知裁判一失管理比賽之能力、禍患立至、且必難恢復其管理之能力、斯時不俟賽畢、或比賽終了而患靴臨頭矣、遇一邊倒之比賽時、切不可放鬆、或因失敗之球員、表示同情而不宣佈其犯規、須知球運之來、頗難逆料、轉瞬而或接近之爭鬥、至斯時若汝對於一方旣已放鬆、他方亦望得同等之待遇、方得乎平、而亂事不旋踵而至者未之有也、在一邊倒之比賽中、裁判放鬆、實屬自然趨勢、故較之接近之比賽、難於執行、因在後種情形之比賽中、裁判員常能謹慎從將事也、</p>
<p>始終如一不私產徧　再有一種失誤、爲裁判員須格外加意者、卽被切勿習於預料比賽之容易執行、倘遇一邊倒之比賽、見一隊紀錄分數高懸時、最易犯此、其實任何比賽、均不可輕意執行、若裁判員必料其係何種局勢、而比賽時、實得其反、於是禍患接踵而至、</p>
<p>茲須贅者、裁判員切不可顧慮某隊之球員犯規較他隊爲多、（不論在前半時後或比賽完畢後、）裁判員於比賽前半時後、不宜查看紀錄簿中彼所宣佈犯規次數之多寡、或何人犯規、致在後半時、易將犯規之宣判、使雙方平均、</p>
<p>使雙方犯規平均、為裁判員切忌之事、即或有時經人之請求、亦絕不可、倘在比賽完畢後、雙方之犯規次數相等、故屬應有之事、惟在多數比賽中、一之犯規較他隊爲多、尤屬理之當然、失敗之一隊或比勝利之隊較多犯規、蓋因狂猛之防衛、及忽促之動作、有以致之、矮小之球隊或比高大者較多犯規、蓋因身小、易於拉人、致成犯規、然有時高大之球隊或比矮小者較多犯規、蓋因身軀魁偉者、易於推人或包圍他人、倘確係犯規則雖明知某隊犯規之被罰較夥、亦决不形響汝之繼續宣判、或處罰、</p>
<p>斯時、有一問題產生者、即「每一比賽究竟應宣佈若干次犯規方爲適當、」則雖經千百人之頭腦加以討論、欲求一平均之數、亦屬徒然、是故任何方式欲求出每次比賽中犯規之平均數、實屬絕大之疑問、究竟誰能道及、或更佳者、誰應道及、在翻閱去歲聯會之紀錄簿中、著者對於其中兩塲比賽、頗覺有趣、此兩塲比賽係連續舉行、且均係相同之二位裁判執法、在第一塲比賽中、計犯規十三次、分爲八比五、在另一塲中、計犯規二十八次、分爲十五比十三、何故一塲十三次犯規而他場二十八次、何以有此等事實、或甚至慮及其多寡之綠因、裁判員奚用深處及此、彼旣不能製造犯規、而犯規又非彼之錯誤、故不論犯規十次二十次或三十次皆球員之所造成、初與裁判員無關、彼不過加以宣佈而已矣、</p>
<p>宣判犯規過多　常開批評家之論調曰、比賽時宣佈犯規太多、與比賽之長短相較、實覺渦夥、因擲罰球而獲勝利之比賽、尤不可勝數、設宣布兩隊之犯規二十次、（不問係何級之比賽）則比賽中每兩分鐘有一次、設宣佈犯規三十次、則每分鐘一次、即比賽之一半時問、然細想之、此種球賽在若是迅速情形之下、則此種犯規之比數、實無足爲奇、</p>
<p>至於比賽因宜佈犯規次數過多而延誤比賽之一點、亦宜道及、此種答案可曰、「啡唯、否否、」全視裁判員及其技能而定、在一裁判員宣判犯規十次、而比賽因而延誤者、有之、在他一裁判員宜判至三三次之多、而比賽之迅速、仍不亞於宜判十次者、亦有之、著者之最高紀錄爲四十八次、其所以舉爲例者、非欲以若是之穴判爲榮、實欲提出以下事實—在比賽完畢後、雙方之球員均表示比賽迅速、且球員之中、無一人覺已宣判如許之犯規、即職員中亦無人發覺、而該次比賽又雙方適爲勁敵、狹路相逢、想讀者不難領會其意、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （其中）</p>
<p>普通寫信，寫信人之名大都寫在末尾的。不具名的匿名信，照理應該稱爲「無尾信」才對，然而一般人不以「無尾信」呼之，而以「無頭信」呼之，這眞是首尾倒置了！</p>
<p>商人出售貨物，無論如何終得賺些錢的，諺所謂「千賣萬賣蝕本不賣」者是也。但是，現在大減價的商店，每用紅紙寫着「不顧血本」的字樣，還有對貿客常言「這是賠本的」。旣不顧血本，則易不將貨物送人而不取分文？旣賠本，則何所謂逐什一之利？</p>
<p>一面接受人家所送的高帽子，一面自己又做了高帽子送人戴，這樣，自己不戴人家的高帽子，而同時也不把高帽子給人戴，豈不爽快！然而天下人大都不肯這樣，這大概是深究過「吃飯，拉矢，矢肥五穀，五穀再變矢」之哲理的。</p>
<h3>阿霞</h3>
<p>— 一心</p>
<p>阿霞是我們同事中最活潑的一位，伊具有美麗的臉蛋，媚人的眸子，走起路來，老是這麽一扭一扭的，尤其當伊的淸脆的歌聲，從音樂室中傳出來的時候，誰都會覺得像喝了一杯濃濃的葡萄酒。</p>
<p>但現在阿霞已離開了此間，而臨走的時候，又是這樣的使人酸鼻。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：</p>
<p>伊家庭因經濟的關係，從小就被伊卑鄙的父母，訂給一位已做了二個兒女父親的辜君，在伊當然威到極度的痛苦，但有什麽辦法想呢？反對這不滿意的婚姻，就是反對伊父母的生命。</p>
<p>可是伊並不放棄她的靑春，伊需要一位忠實的愛人，芷如伊需要生命一樣。伊不絕地用伊愛的火花，向人們投去，最後伊的火花終於停住在一位恭君身上。但伊又捨不得伊的父母，爲了伊失掉生活的憑依，伊又一方面用着巧妙的手腕，敷衍辜君。</p>
<p>自從伊吞下了這顆重量的炸彈，伊日夜憂慮着，最近伊已咯了幾次血。</p>
<p>造物似乎專門在作弄伊似的，重量的炸彈，終於爆發了。</p>
<p>是前星期日的晚上，恭和辜，不期然地在伊的校中遇見了，無疑的，恭君是氣得昏過去，而辜君呢，又施用着他奸詐的微笑，迫着伊入他的圈套。於是伊就走了這一步——自殺，幸而救得快，好了。</p>
<p>昨天起，伊已正式過着如夫人的生活，而恭君呢？也在極度的悲哀下，已去度他的漂泊的生涯。</p>
<p>伊走後，同事們都像失落了什麽似的，老是不見春的到來，雖然這時正是四處桃花，都炫耀着誘人的美色。</p>
<h3>仙霓清歌</h3>
<p>— 心雲</p>
<p>一年半來，隨着曲友哲存瘦鷗二君常去仙霓社傾聽那種沒有絲毫烟火氣的淸歌，居然也上了癮，平均每三天總得去一次，去的時候總是從鬧塲鑼鼓聽起，直聽到完塲才歇，而且還得帶幾本曲譜，細細咀嚼，眞比從前在學堂裏上課還認眞。因此便使我認識了幾位值得傾倒的崑劇家。現在就奏他們將離上海他去之前，寫將出來，介紹給大衆：</p>
<p>朱傳茗　他是現在仙霓社掛正牌的台柱子，是唱小旦和貼的，有崑劇梅蘭芳的雅號。他的特長在于身上臉上手上都有戲情，唱的調兒更是抑揚頓挫，疾徐有致，使你聽了，會有說不出的興味。而他日當的私生活，又是非常規矩安靜，像一位舊家庭的子弟一樣。</p>
<p>沈傳錕　淨角是最不容易唱的脚色，要求好的淨角在平劇中也不多，在崑劇中，眞要讓沈君獨佔鰲頭了。（不過他唱的是武淨；仙霓社尚有一邵傳鏞君，專工文淨，亦甚佳。）他唱的關公戲，尤其出色驚人，刀會一折，我敢說除他之外，沒有第二人了。他那嗓音之嘹亮，也着實不輸如金少山君。</p>
<p>趙傳珺　這一位可說是標準的唐明皇，他唱長生殿，簡直折折都好。有一次我曾胃着大雨，專去聽他唱「聞鈴」，聽後滿意已極，恨不能馬上去找慕琴兄，介紹他灌唱片。</p>
<p>倪傳鉞　他是唱生，外，或末的，無論掛黑鬚白鬚，扮相都極淸穆。嗓子好極了，「彈詞」和「草詔」二折，會使你聽得三月不知肉味。</p>
<p>姚傳薌　他是唱貼旦的，能戲極多，無論去那個角色，决不會使人失望，瘦鷗說他像平劇中的芙蓉草，眞是一些也不錯。他不大唱正塲戲，往往給人搭配，可是老于顧曲者沒有一個不稱賞他，確乎可算是一個頂括括的硬裏子。</p>
<p>此外，如周傳瑛，張傳芳，施傳鎮，沈傳芷，注傳鈐等也各有各的特長，一時也寫不盡；還有那後起之秀的方傳芸，唱戲認眞，又肯聽話芸將來必然也是一位出色的人物。</p>
<h3>輕重各異！</h3>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>酒鬼</h3>
<p>— 倦龍</p>
<p>幾條曙曦打破壁縫和窓洞裏漏了進來，室中還是朦朧地。醉了一夜的胡大海，這時照例是該醒的時候了。嘴裏乾得發苦，肚裏也嘰哩咕嚕響着。他一骨碌下了床，把那絛黑色上面又染上一層骯髒的藍花老布被習慣地向床裏一摔。提起昨夜留下的已滲上了一層灰的一杯冷茶往嘴裏一送——</p>
<p>「他媽的！你不回老家咱也不喝這口冷茶了！」</p>
<p>他睜開迷矇的失了神的眼睛，若見茶杯旁一隻昔日妻子梳妝的「鏡箱」，他又咕嚕起來了。但咕嚕是他的老性子，妻子和孩子的死已沒有使他榨出一滴眼淚的效力了。</p>
<p>他的衣服已忘記是什麼時候着到現在，也不知道換—一或許已沒有衣換，也不知道洗。每夜喝醉了酒，便和衣睡到天明，胸襟已給酒漬，油漬涎沬，積得像理髪匠用的刮刀布。他的頭髮和鬍髭全忘記有幾個月不修了。</p>
<p>爲了酒，把一份薄產也蕩得精光。他的哥哥也把他當作已死的人一樣。他是孤獨的人，但他沒有感到這是悲哀—他的心巳給酒浸得僵木了。自從妻子和孩子一死，他便更愛酒，一斤四兩，幾粒蘭花豆，泰然地坐在街頭獨飲獨酌，像個活神仙。酒一到了量，他的嘴又像黃河之水似地滔滔不絕的咕嚕起來。可是他咕的什麼？誰也聽不出，而且誰也不願聽。他咕得興起時，便大罵起來！罵的是誰？連他自己也莫明其妙！想到誰便罵誰，給誰聽見就給誰拷一。「但他不會反抗，反而說：</p>
<p>—老哥！你打我終不會錯的！終要我好的！</p>
<p>可你打吧！」</p>
<p>得是打的人和伏在店櫃裏的夥計們，反而給好氣失笑了。他的哥哥看到這種情形，只有嘆引——</p>
<p>「唉！祖宗沒有做過一件壞事，卻會生下這麼一個「敗子」，也是「氣數」！」</p>
<p>有時胡大海沒錢去沽酒時，就會向他的哥哥出氣：</p>
<p>「哼！你繼得阿法的一份產業心定啦！你還有二個兒子在外面掙錢哪！你心定啦！……你看不起我！咳！你不過仗着二個兒子呀！我是精光啦！完啦！……」</p>
<p>他的哥哥起初本來不理他，但有時實在聽不入耳！便摑他幾下耳光！『你道斷命鬼你氣不過我二個兒子嗎？你氣不過我得阿法的產業嗎？你有兒子也可以來承繼呀！你想把這三房薄產都弄光來給你喝酒嗎？」</p>
<p>他摸了摸紅赤的臉——</p>
<p>「好！你打！哥打弟也是該的！我錯！我錯……</p>
<p>他的脚步是一輕一重的，身體好像是個紙壳。平平的路，他也會跌下去。有時牙齒跌出了血，有時面上跌去了一塊皮，有時臉上染來一顆泥，有時……。但他都不覺着一些痛苦和羞慚——</p>
<p>「好！你打！我……我死也……也活該！你……好……。』接着後面便發出一陣陰險的訕笑。</p>
<p>跨進了那座低低而破敗的屋，裏面是陰黯地，還夾着一陣灰蒸氣。那些東倒西斜的褪了紅漆的古舊傢具已上了一層灰，室中很淒涼，像是一座荒蕪的古廟。</p>
<p>但他一躺到床上便呼呼地睡去了。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>月英道：我們也是知道的，不過我們也有我們的打算，只要舅舅給我們作三分主就行了。北海道：這樣看起來，你娘和你祖母的意思，也不一定要跟了人到東方去的，就是西安有地方可以安身立命，也就不走了，月英道：那是自然。我們湖南老家，雖說還有些田產，兩代沒有回家了，一個人又不認得回去了，也不見得有出路。所以我們有是有回老家的一條路子，但是也不敢放了胆走。北海坐不住了，放下了書本，在屋子裏來回的踱着步子，因道：和你提親的那些人說，得有些消息了嗎？他口裏如此說時，臉也不敢向帳子看着。月英對於賈多才那班人當面談婚姻，那是處於無可奈何的地位，只好碍了面子硬挺老實說，自己是不把這些人看在眼裏的。至於王北海呢，卻是年歲相當的人，也不知什麼緣故，見了這種人，就有些害臊，現在讓他當面來問，雖是藏在帳子裏被褥裏了，依然是十分不好意思，卻並沒有答出一個字來。北海道：我聽到茶房說，前面有人請你吃飯，這是眞事嗎？月英道：是眞的。窮人那是沒有法子的。他這種解釋，自然是不大好明暸，不過北海好像很懂得他的意思所在似的，就深深的替他歎了一口氣。只在這時，房門外有一陣人聲喧譁，已經有了程志前的聲音在內。北海也不解爲什麼自己要心虛，面孔就立刻紅了起來了。（一八九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>挑繡一副，又須把這方貢緞重行綳過，使第二副應繡的鞋面移上來，不必繡的人俯下頭去遷就它，這樣也可略省幾許目力。不過每副貢緞上的四五副鞋面，决不能同樣繡一種花卉，往往第一副繡的是梅花，而第二副卻是繡的牡丹花了，因此繡的人竟無老文章可抄，必須另外再剪起紙花來，另外再覓起一朵可以做標本的鮮花來，重新定部位，選顏色；先前繡第一副鞋面所得的經騐，簡直絲毫不能利用，精力的浪費，端的是非言可喻，無怪我當初一瞧見就要搖頭了！</p>
<p>及至一切的手續全齊備了，—這就是說得到鞋面上的花樣已繡好，鞋跟和鞋底巳一起釘好，並把那鞋面也縫到了底上去，形成了一雙完整的鳳鞋以後，—還有一套最後的手續，那就是裝釘珠寶等飾物的手續了。太后的鳳鞋上，珍珠，寶石，璞玉，翡翠等，一應寶貴的飾物，可說是應有盡有；但伊老人家自已所最心愛的，尤其是珍珠。伊常說珍珠是鳳鞋上最適宜的裝飾品。無論大小的珍珠，伊都歡喜；因此伊御用的鳳鞋上，幾乎是沒有一雙不釘珍珠的了。那些較小的珍珠是用絲綫串起來，串得像一條花邊一樣，然後再把它曲曲灣灣地盤釘在鞋面上；雖然用以連貫它們的只是一根很細的絲綫，似乎很容易裂斷的，但是我在宮內住了幾年，卻從不曾見過它們裂斷，也從不曾聽到過有人拾得一顆打太后的鳳鞋上掉下來的珍珠。（二九九）</p>

<h3>勞倫司的生涯與作品</h3>
<p>— 任白濤</p>
<p>勞倫司（D．H．Lawrence）於一八八五年九月十一日生於諾定昂（Nattingham）州。父親是炭鑛的鑛夫。勞倫司在他兄弟姊妹中排行第四。十三歲得獎學資金入諾定昂高等學校。十六歲出學校，進某外科器具製造工塲做工。但到十八歲時爲取得教員設書起見進諾定昂大學。他在這個大學認識了有名的言語學者魏克利教授（Prof．E．Weekly）；並着手寫處女作「白孔雀」（The　White　Peacock）。他的母親患癌腫於一九一〇年死去。他想叫母親在死前看看「白孔雀」，特別印了一冊，但是母親竟沒有看到。在諾定昂大學修業兩年，取得教員證書到倫敦近郊的克羅教（Croydon）的David　Road，School擔任教務。在這個教員時期，他寫了好多的論文，短篇和詩。勸他寫作的，不是他的母襯而是他的戀人——即在“Son　and　Lovers”中的做‘Miriam’的這位姑娘。她自己把他的詩作五篇送給雜誌“English　Review”，這是一九〇九年的事。經主編這個雜誌的赫法（F．M．Huefier）刊登出來，於是勞倫司遂正式上了英國的文壇；給他介紹「白孔雀」由漢尼壘社出版的，就是此人（一九一一）。在這個當兒，他又在赫法的雜誌上發表了好幾篇論文和小品。過了兩年，他便辭去教職，專心從事文筆的工作。出克羅敦的學校沒多時，由德國的大學聘爲講師，他也謝絕了。但不久他到德國去，在巴威略（Bavaria）任了六個月，又往意大利的額爾德湖（Lake　Garda）去了。在這其間，第二個長篇“The　Trespasser”出版（一九一二）。</p>
<p>一九一三年二月，最初的詩集“Love　Poems　and　Others”出版；過了兩月，他的大作“Sons　and　Lovers”也刊行了。這時候地住在巴威略的首都。六月回英，暫留其根德州的海濱。八月再往巴戚略。九月赴意大利。斯比日亞灣，直住到翌年六月。</p>
<p>一九一四年七月歸英，同德國男　李歇託芬（ven　Richthoien）的姑娘芙莉達（Prieda）結婚。但芙莉達原是做過他大學時代的舊師魏克利教授的夫人的女兒，比他年長八歲，並且巳經生過三個孩子了。關於這個羅曼斯的詳細，在勞倫司的女弟子喀斯威兒（C．Carswell）的勞倫司回憶記“The　Savage　Pilgrimage”中寫着。又在這一年，他的最初的短篇集“The　Prusian　Officer”出版。十二月，兩人住到倫敦西西北的怕欽哈（Backingham）州的卡歇收（Ohesbam）地方；翌年一月遷於南海岸撒塞克斯（Sussien）的怕爾堡（Pulborough）。</p>
<p>一九一五年八月轉居倫敦的市外。九月，「虹」（“TheRainbow”）出版。這部小說，名義上是因爲妨害風紀，被禁發行，其實是書中含非戰的成分，觸犯了當局的忌諱。「虹」被禁賣，對勞倫悟是個很利害的打擊。對於這個事件，在文壇，只有辛克萊爾（M.Sinclair）和白乃特（A．Bennelt）稍稍做過有同情的辯獲，另外沒有一個人帮他的忙。他爲大戰所受的迫害，還不止此：只因他的夫人是德國人，所以他住在孔瓦爾（Cornwall）州的海岸，受到本國當局的疑惑，說他有通敵的嫌疑，任他家裏搜索過。他在大戰當時怎樣地吃苦，這一看在“Kangaroo”中的The　Nighlmare章，便可明白。貧窮和其他的壓迫，再度的發行禁止，病苦——他的一生涯便是苦鬥的歷史。</p>
<p>他的孔瓦阿時代，是一九一五年十二月到一七年十月。在這其間出了隨筆“Twilight　inItaly”和詩集“Amores”。從一九一七年十月到翌到一月住在倫敦，後來遷往巴克（Burke）州的紐伯（Newbruy），五月又來到達比（Derby）州的米得爾屯（Middleton）。在一九一九年十一月，因戰事吿終，遂渡意大利：在佛棱斯住到十二月，又赴喀波里（Capri）島；翌年三月，遷往西西里島東海岸的塔奧爾米諾（Taormina）。一九二一年四月。離開此地，經意大利而入德國，寄居巴登（Baderi）。在這其間，第四小說“W　omenin　Love”由倫教的塞喀社出版（一九二一）；但這部小說已經由紐約出過豫約限定版了（一九二〇）。他夫妻兩人又從巴登返歸西西里了。那個冬季，勞倫司往遊地中海的撒丁島；他的收穫是出版了“Sea　and　Sardnia”（紐約一九二一；倫敦一九二三）。</p>
<p>一九二二年勞倫悟夫妻往印度去，在錫蘭島住有兩個月。隨後又渡澳洲，約任三個月。‘Aaron's　Rod’的出版，就是在那個時候。一九二二年八月，夫妻離開澳洲，經紐約，南太平洋羣島，九月到舊金山。又從這里到新墨西哥州的它喔斯（Taos）；更往墨西哥去。</p>
<p>勞倫悟在一九二三年秋天漫　遊全關而又返回墨西哥。一九二三年八月夫人歸英，他到十一月也返國了。歸國住到翌年一月底，兩人又往遊巴登，巴黎，再歸倫敦；但到三月又上渡美的船：這回是直航到新墨西哥去了。在新墨西哥住到一九二四年十月，又往墨西哥南部的瓦哈喀（Oaxace）州去。他在那里集了“Mornings　in　Mexico”的材料的大部分，並且完成了“The　Plumed　Serpent”（一九二六）；後來在“The　Woman　Who　Rode　Away”中所收的短篇，也乙是當時寫的。</p>
<p>勞倫悟於一九二五年十月回英；但立即往巴登的芙莉達的母家央；隨後往斯波淘爾　（Spotorno），住到二六年三月。在這其間“The　Plumed　Serpent”出版。</p>
<p>夫妻倆從斯波淘爾諾往佛稜斯，在市外租住一個別莊。在這裏，勞倫司着手寫他的最後的長篇“Lady　Chatterley's　Lover”。這部小說一共換過三回稿，初版是佛棱斯的G．Orioli印行的帶署名的限定私版（一九二八）。他們除到德·英·瑞士作短期旅行之外，在佛棱斯的別莊算是直住到一九二八年五月。</p>
<p>從一九二八年三月到十一月間，他勿的行蹤是瑞士·德國·南法蘭西，而最後落到班倒爾（Bandol）；在這裏住到一九二九年。</p>
<p>他們隨後又旅行巴黎·佛棱斯。二九年四月到靠西班牙的地中海的巴利亞諸島住了一個多月。他决定在倫敦開繪畫展覽會，就是這其間的事。但這個展覽會被倫敦當局干涉，開不成功。後來那些作品都移到南法蘭西的汎斯（Vence）去了。同年夏天，往德國旅行；他的詩集“Pansies”在這其間出版。</p>
<p>一九三〇年二月，移住汎斯的山間。三月二日病歿。他爲患支氣管炎和喘息，在陰雨天關閉到一個房間中。他的英國的朋友們接到他害病的通吿，想着沒有什麽要緊，不料幾天以後竟死。因此之故，會葬者僅有四十幾人。他的墓前，只有愛他的某農夫集那裏的小石頭所作製的『不死鳥』（Phoenix）——是他早巳選做自己的圖案的——像什麽象徵一般在立着。</p>
<h3>曲拾</h3>
<p>— 沃圃</p>
<p>西樓記</p>
<p>李調元雨村曲話卷下有云：</p>
<p>「作曲最忌出情理之外；王舜耕所撰西樓記，於撮合不來時，脫出一頒（按當作胥）長公，殺無罪之妾，以刧人之妾爲友妻，結搆至此，可謂自墮苦海。舜耕，高郵人。」</p>
<p>接着一條又說：</p>
<p>「西樓工於調號，其第六齣「私契」所白：「見了錦帆榮府，日夜稱頓大名。」乃舜耕自負。故云：「語兒曹，陽春古奏，和者甚寥寥。」</p>
<p>李氏以西樓記爲高郵王舜耕所作，這兩段記載實犯了雙重的錯誤。李氏當時並袁子令這個人都不知道，眞是奇怪的事—他所以「緾夾」到王舜耕身上來，恐怕是因散曲集西樓樂府牽合致訛無疑。散曲和戲曲的分別，以前本甚混淆不辨，大約李氏適偶想不着西樓記的作者是誰？便糊裏糊塗的給王舜耕聯在一起了。但是明末號西樓的，實有二人；一王磐，字鴻漸，高郵人。一王田，字舜耕，濟南人。二王都是散曲作家，極有聲譽，明人談曲的，便已不大分得淸楚，常常混指。現傳的西樓樂府是王鴻漸作。（見任二北散曲叢刊及曲諧）李氏所說的高郵王舜耕，在籍貫與著述上，恰又更加弄錯了。這似並不能單單責怪他。</p>
<p>以往談曲諸書，除雨村曲話外，梁廷楠藤花亭曲話，楊恩壽詞餘叢話，不都每犯有這種「以臆逞談」的毛病。如果要據他們所記爲「與要」的話，尤其對於比較隱晦些的材料，大概是不能不特別注意於擇別及檢校一番的。</p>
<h3>跳舞馬拉松（三）</h3>
<p>— （美國LT法來耳作）宜閑譯</p>
<p>於是艱難的時勢來到美國了。太克司在冬天失了業，他的蓄落又復化了乾凈。他給一家糖果店雇去，十二小時的工作，每星期十塊錢，過了十個月這生意又丟了。他進一家大菜館，幹着洗碟子的工作，每星期七塊錢，後來他的工錢減到了五塊。他每夜僵着手，　着背，很疲倦的走回家去。他是更沒有錢上跳舞會了。後來他這洗碟子的差使也失掉了。</p>
<p>他走着各條街，尋着別的工作，他所聽到的總是同樣的故事——艱難的時勢。他吃得很省儉，他住在有許多老鼠在那單齦的，冷冰冰的房間裏，他巴不得再回到爺臘山間他的故鄉去。他天天出去尋生意，有時他找到了短期的工作，他捱過了幾天或是幾星期，再竭力找事。一天，他看見了一個廣告，上頭幾個大字——跳舞馬拉松（Dance　Marathon）他考察了一番才知道這是一種競賽，參加這競賽的人都得拚命跳舞着，誰跳舞得最長久，誰就算是優勝者，這優勝者可得五百元獎金。也許這塲競賽，他會得錦標的罷，那麽，他就可以在電影界得到一個位置，成爲美國女郎的意中人，否則也可以到歌舞塲上去表演一番，或是跟什麽酒館訂一個跳舞合同了。況且在競賽的時間，有人照料着，他旣有東西可喫，又用不着出房間的租錢。他身體壯健，他又會跳舞。他在菜館在糖菓店，又在酒排間裏兩脚是整天的站慣了的。這眞是他發財的機會呵。他甩不着再到處奔走，聽人家說，因爲時勢艱難的緣故，不添用人手了這種話。這是比之積受了錢，自己來開一個糖菓店，照雇用過他的那些美國籍希臘人的樣，漸漸兒富起來，好得多了。他贏了這競賽，出了名聲，他就可以帶着滿是衣服和洋錢的箱子回雅典去，也許去的時候還帶一個有錢的美國老婆，那皮膚奶一般的。</p>
<p>太克司加入了「跳舞馬拉松」他背上挿上了一個號數，指定一個舞侶，名叫瑪利格林，這一個美麗的碧眼女郎，正是他常常夢想着會做他的老婆的一流。起初這個女郎遇見他的時候，她不由得心頭一震，臉上擺出厭惡的表情來。然而隨即看明了他是身體壯健的闊肩膀的人，她卻就笑迷迷的把一隻軟綿綿的手向他送過去，嬌滴滴地對她說，她知道他們這一對一定會得錦標的。</p>
<h3>一個黃昏進候</h3>
<p>— 石耶</p>
<p>說起來，這一段故事，前後已經久遠，但就是到現在，我還時常想起，不能忘記……</p>
<p>是前年秋天的一個黃昏，我帶了前妻亡故的消息，到一家姓姚的親戚家裏去，去通報一聲我的一病年半的妻子，終於回天無術而死去，祗剩下了一個四歲的孩子，和一個我了。</p>
<p>姚家是住一所頗爲寬敞的單幢房子裏，因爲人多，連間壁的一間下客堂也借住了，有門可以開通。我走進去的時候，客堂裏沉沉無聲，祇有一個醫生坐在紅木桌邊，用着毛筆，發出颯颯的聲音，在寫着膚方子。姚父，年紀巳六十以外，頭髮鬍子，巳經雪白，坐在醫生的對面，面容蹙然；相同年紀的姚母，因爲曾經受過一塲火災的虛驚，人已有點遲鈍，頭半低着，呆呆的坐在一個角落裏。秋日陰闇的夜色在漸漸地籠罩下來，籠罩這帶有悲寂意味的客堂。</p>
<p>我因爲久已不去，兩老都站起身來，作着歡迎的樣子，臉孔上透出一點點笑意，一眼看見我臂上纏着黑紗，驚問何人過世了，我答說是我的內人。</p>
<p>「喔，可惜，究竟是什麽病？」兩老同聲問道。</p>
<p>「肺病。是一二八以後起的。」</p>
<p>「什麼時候過世的？」</p>
<p>「禮拜以前。」</p>
<p>兩老默默的聽着。在他們臉上，同時掛上同情惋惜的，但又痛苦的神色。其時，醫生方子已經開好，一邊站起身來，一邊嘴裏說着吃兩帖試試看。</p>
<p>「是不是秀姊又病了？」我問道。</p>
<p>「是呀，她這病三不兩時要發的，道回比較重得多，已經請了三四個發生看過了。」姚母黯然答道。</p>
<p>從隔壁一間作爲臥室的下客堂裏，這時逐來兩三聲輕弱的咳嗽聲。我坐着的客堂裏頓時靜寂得像潑了水一樣，兩老眼角潮潤，醫生凝視着找　上的黑紗。</p>
<p>最後，醫生走了，客堂裏祇剩了兩個年老的人，和一個襄妻的我，天色更幽喑了。</p>
<p>我本想走到隔室去，探視一下秀姊的病情，但一想到秀妹病的也是肺病，而且據說照迷信，和我的前妻還有點因果關係，因此終於不曾立起身來。心中隱隱作悲痛，眼望着兩老，而想起那不可相信的一點因果來。</p>
<p>原來，從那時算起的五年之前，我同前妻結婚的那天，秀姊也同了其他的姊妹們來帮過忙，前妻新娘的頭面，就由秀姊所裝，但因爲結婚時的一點風葛，性子爆燥的前妻在新裝時候發了氣，用手敲到秀姊的身上，而且梳頭的木梳也落地了，這照迷信上說，是於帮助新裝的人不吉利的，事後，秀姊因身體單薄，病了起來，據姚母私下裏說，其最初的種因即用新娘的手敲了她的綠故，其他老年紀的人，也都是這般說法。從此，我於心隱隱覺得歉然，有怕受到無言的責難，少到她的家裏去。</p>
<p>現在想不到秀姊固然一病地了幾年，而前妻卻以健壯之身，也攖肺病，而反先去世了。想到這裏實有不可言說的哀痛。</p>
<p>我從沉思裏醒轉來，抬頭忽看見對墻上掛着一幅秀姊病後瞧的相，清麗的臉唇上有着一種脈脈哀愁。兩眼溫柔，卻含有幽悲的情味。一邊，隔室裏，又傳來輕清的咳嗽聲。</p>
<p>那一天黃昏，兩老總算殷殷留我晚飯，可是我似負重罪，不敢久坐，推說有別的事故，匆匆走出，單留下一句候秀姊的話，也單留下兩個老的在寂寞的秋日的黃昏時候，看護他們年紀尚輕的愛女，因爲那一天，剛巧她的嫂嫂姊妹們都不在家。</p>
<p>這位年紀尚輕，還本出嫁的秀姊給於也在去年春天去世了，我在送喪的途中，默默說禱前後兩個死者的和解安息。</p>
<p>「你們兩個，都是我所敬愛的人，不幸都在年紀輕輕的時候死去：不遇，如果年輕的死是幸的，那麼你們已經是幸活的了。</p>
<p>「你們兩個，請從此在別一世界裏和解罷，因為死，即是和解。」</p>
<h3>山中牧歌（三）</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>等到他曉得明天後天都要同路走的時候，才把臉色放軟和了，而且做出很留心聽取對方談的種話語，然而他也不肯太把自己降低，總是尋着機會將息曾經做過大生各意的話，含含糊糊地表示出來。</p>
<p>「三吊二麽？嚇，從前我的鋪子只消二吊四哩！這…」</p>
<p>或者，說到私販鴉片會賺大錢的事，他便搖一搖年說：</p>
<p>「這筆生意我們是不做的了，……那簡直害人呀！老實說，這樣賺來的錢，我們也瞧不起，運洋布洋紗那才是正途，我告訴你，老哥。」</p>
<p>因爲，聽着這般情形的話，老徐，做一點點小生意的老徐，便不得不油然生敬起來，店老板端飯來的時候，就用小販對待好主顧那樣的臉，色，瞇小兩個皺紋圍着的眼睛，客氣地請道：</p>
<p>「秦老板，請上坐！請上坐！」</p>
<p>「不要客氣！」</p>
<p>雖是這麽說了一句，秦老板並不讓一讓對方，就上去坐着。做私烟生意的老陳，早就感到極不痛快，現在便只有埋頭吃他的飯了。等秦老板走聞的時候，老陳將筷子朝碗上一敲，向老徐說道：</p>
<p>「媽的，運洋貨賣的東西就高貴麽？那才怪了！……歸根結底，一句話，洋鬼子的奴隸！」</p>
<p>但到第二天早上，呌做秦老板的竟至爲了給店錢不肯掉換一個啞板銅元而和店主人吵嘴起來，老陳便把承認他是什麽老板的意見也取消了，輕輕用乎肘靠一靠老徐的身子低聲說道：</p>
<p>「看呀，做過大老板的會是這個樣子麽？你才信進去了！」</p>
<p>所以，在路上一跳都在慫恿老徐，和秦老板作對哩。</p>
<p>一個出門人將他不高興的心情發抒了之後，如果會唱一點兒歌的話，他是要信口唱唱的。現在的老陳就正好處在這樣的境地裏，便唱起山歌來了，起始用着自己本來的男腔，帶着戲弄人的語氣。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>禁止一夫多妻與販賣婦子</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>二十一號伊司丹埠電，載着這樣一叚「國際婦運」的消息稱：「國際女權運動大會頃在此間開會，通過决議案，規定對於禁止販賣白人婦女及禁止一夫多妻制，不不得有東方西方之別，關於婦女之待遇，不得因其國際與宗教而有所歧視」云云，在我國許多地方婦女的販賣，不僅普遍，且亦削價到兩元三元或以年歲計值（一歲一元）的現在，同時在「納妾制度」贗除後而男女間「同居生活」的「家屬關係」則甚盛行的現在，此一决議是值得我們提出來談談的事。</p>
<p>我非女兒身，未能體騐到被淪為「貨殖」與陷入「媵妾」的生活，究竟是怎樣痛苦，但是歷史與現實向我勿記載的，一則粵「牛馬」，再則曰「玩具」，概而言之，大約不「人」。以耳目口鼻舌五官俱全，而又圓顱方趾的動物，竟不能得與其同頓動物的男性有同等待遇，確乎是「人類社會」的「奇跡」。這一「奇跡」存乎鳥獸蛇蟲之間，似乎都可被我們的生物學家特別注意了，然而卻發生於我們到了二十世紀且復自命「文明」的「人」間，竟視作當然，熟視無睹，眞是「天曉得」！</p>
<p>這一「天曉得」的事情，若行之於「乾爲坤綱」的時候，到也罷了，不過我們現在開口「尊重女權」，閉口「男女平等」，未免自已也難以爲情。國際女權大會諸君登高一呼，從而禁止之取締之，毫無問題，我是高舉雙手，表示附議。可是消滅販賣婦女的現象與贗除一夫多妻的惡習，欲從這一「决議」而禁止，便能克底於成，卻不能無疑。</p>
<p>有了那一種人吃人和人掠取人的社會不平，使有那種販賣婦女的事件產生。因爲只有這樣的環境才有人願意將婦女出賣，才有人有權利和可能來購買婦女，販賣婦女的經紀人在其間不過起着副作用，「應市塲需要產生」而已。可是女權運動諸君子，放下案情不談，抓着從兇當正犯的來加以禁止，吾未見其有濟。</p>
<h3>高貴的人</h3>
<p>— 淨夫</p>
<p>走過陳家莊的人們，總常帶着羡慕的口氣嘆呌：「哦，那便是陳二爺的房子了！」多少年的風雨吹打，這座高雅龐大的大廈，仿是那麽巍峨壯的。陳二爺，是陳家莊的第一個富爺爺，頂高貴的人呵！誰的腦子裏都還記往那高貴的陳二爺的往年的聲色。</p>
<p>可是，自從陳二爺第五次的回鄉後，情形可就變了</p>
<p>現在，這令人一見仍有點神往的陳二爺的大夏門前，天天散佈着許多兒童　在跑動若，打時出現一個可怕的人。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>孩子們喜歡逗着他玩，調皮的還要戲弄他。這可怕的人，便是以前聲勢嚇人的高貴的陳二爺了。從前兒童們逢見了他，是那麼驚羨懼怕呢。他從南洋帶回了許多金錢，變成一個頂高貴的人們；可是最後一次的榮歸故里，亦帶來了麻瘋病。麻瘋病，多可怕的名詞！</p>
<p>陳二爺那些高貴的兒子，媳婦和妻，全不在這大廈內陪伴着他，統在南洋守住　互富的財產。惟有兩個僕人看見他便掩住鼻子嗤嗤的，算服侍着他。深高的大廈內太空寂了，陳二爺常常拉住手杖，歪顛的搖着臃腫的身體，脹爛的臉孔，出沒在這大廈門前。孩子們雖是怪可惡，但總比死躺在房子裏熱鬧些有生氣些。</p>
<p>臃腫的身軀一探出門邊，孩子們便掩着鼻子指着他嗤嗤的呌：「哦，哦，麻瘋子…麻瘋子…」孩子們旣怕這渾身腐爛的麻瘋病者，又喜迎近靑他找玩笑，尋開心。他要搖進門內去，還要忙趕上去：「麻瘋子，麻瘋子，不要走……」嘻嘻哈哈，有的還用樹枝子，小石子向他擲去，拍着小手掌呌快。</p>
<p>手，脚，臉上，現着一粒粒的爛瘡，黃色的膿，微紅色的蒼口、欲滴的毒汁。蒼蠅嗡嗡的跟着這陳二爺糾纏不休。陳二爺只能扭動皮肉，表露痛苦而已。過路的人們往往要指着說：多可怕的呌化子呀！誰也沒有想到這便是那頂有威權的高貴的人！</p>
<p>是呵！陳二爺是南洋的富人。可是他的刻薄卑吝，也是頂知名的。吃過他許多虧的人們，都沒有料到他是這樣的結果呢？有錢的富人，他很愛惜他那多量的金錢，但是他狠愛種種的娛樂。陳二爺十足的風流；可是更萬二分的愛惜自己的金錢。所以他頂不贊成那些去逛窯子嫖妓女的人，那可眞傻瓜呵！他陳二爺便想出個方法。買了女僕人，旣能够夜夜當妓女那樣的效用，又可以替他勞動，這是最合算的了。於是，陳二爺便因貧這小便宜而從這「雙料」女僕人身上，傳染到不可救藥的麻瘋病。麻瘋子，不容於人們，又給洋人驅逐出境。終於便寂寞的獨個子住在那高貴的大廈內了，他回來時，誰都驚呌：「怎麽陳二爺變成這樣子…多麽高貴的人！」但之後，人們便要當着可怕的陳二爺的面前設：「刻薄成家，哦，你頂高貴，…可是。現在……？卑吝到這樣子……」同時，吐着口涎，哈哈的走了。</p>
<p>「這便是頂高貴的富人呵！這可卑的麻瘋子……」</p>
<h3>歸國的前後</h3>
<p>— 重林</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>船進吳淞口，我們開始望見中國的田隴，草木，瓦屋，我非常的出驚，腦子裏還淸楚的留着歐洲的田隴，草木，瓦屋這一切鄉景印象，特然覺得中國的鄉景刧是那樣軟弱，枯萎，而緲小，就是非洲一毛不長的沙漠也還比牠有生氣，有精神。</p>
<p>天飄着雨，三朵雪，陰沉沉的，像我們離里昂時天一樣天氣。船本該在早上十時靠岸，可是從香港到上海的海程裏有大風浪，把到期就祖誤了，天漸漸暗起來，在帶着雪意的海風裏，我們抖悚悚的立着，立着，從下午二時起，這時已下午五時過了，期待着快到我們眼前的上海。</p>
<p>幾年前我負着重重的瘡傷，侮辱離開上海，幾年前我同時負着朋友的好意，厚望離開上海，現在我怎樣重見牠？在踏着上海的岸時，我就明白了：我終於是被人誤解的，一種隱然的惡意在窺探機會而預備重新中傷我的。</p>
<p>在海關上亂了一陣，擠了一陣，等了一陣，檢查之後，我們別離了同伴王君，見到我們的親戚與朋友。我們在船靠岸時，就老早望見了他們，一種說不出的歡喜竟使我們陶醉在眼淚裏了。然而這歡喜的眼淚，對於我就立刻變成悲哀的眼淚，我到這時候才知我已經是一個失掉慈母的孤子了，一個眞眞可憐的人了。</p>
<p>在上海的街上走，第一使我討厭而不慣的，如在香港一樣，便是那些廣吿，其次便是那些上海的時式女子，她們大半電燙了頭髮，散蓬蓬的像一個未裝置好的洋囡囡的頭。她們的服裝已知道把腰裁細，把臀部顯出來，但是還不知道把胸部挺起。一位小姐對我說：</p>
<p>『「小婦人」那書眞流行呀，我們大家都愛看牠，這可說是一本近年來最好的書了。』</p>
<p>這樣是一個新女子的自白，從事婦女述動的太太，小姐，先生們怎樣想想？</p>
<p>在上海我覺得過日子完全不是像我在歐洲時似的，充滿了工作及其牠。在上海，日子好似特別過得快，一個下午只能看一個朋友，並且在這朋友家裏並不坐長久的。後來我偶然立在旅館津臺的窗口，發明其所以然了。在上海的　路上走，我覺得十分不痛快，前面後面好似都有牆壁阻攔住似的，這些爲行人所砌成的牆壁，實在也是上海的中國大商埠的特色，他們之中正經有事幹的少，閑蕩的在路上踏死　蟻的居多，東張西望，一邊談，一邊罵，你有急事要迅速的到達你的目的地也不可能，你的時間就消磨在這些之中，譬如去看一個朋友，路上本來只須半小時，但你被這些　人東攔西阻，弄到須一小時的時間。上海還有的特色，便是吵鬧的人聲，像歐洲城市裏，阜上工人，店員，辦事人等上工時的地道車門口人擠得烏黑的只見一披一被的像浪似的轉去，但是靜靜的，遠沒有上海的一條小街裏的吵鬧。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>我還到這個童年時別離了的故鄉來，一切對於我都是新鮮的，好似第一次才認識似的，四周的鄰居，族戚，老的大半已死去，小的我都不認識，的確有點兒童相見不相識，笑問客從何處來」的實境。在我們的舖着方磚的房間裏，坐落間裏的玻璃窗口，望出去是一條狹小的河，河的那岸使是所謂河北了。河北人家的草屋依然像古畫裏似的隱隱約約。我們的屋前塲上積着好幾個稻堆，竹籬外，這時候整個田隴裏是嫩嫩的菜心，才出起來的蠶豆秧，與綠葱葱的狗杞頭草。</p>
<p>還到家裏，我覺得最特別的，最新鮮的，是橡皮套鞋與香烟這兩種東西的普遍。雨天，走在到鎮上去的泥路上時，遇到的附竹裙的農人，他們個個都穿着橡皮套鞋。高而富香烟，連那些念經，吃素以及理綫頭來自己織布的太太少奶奶們——先前我出國時她們都不吸烟的—現都嘴裏銜着一枝香烟，吸一口烟，透一口長氣，好似恨不得把烟灰也吸進肚裏去的。一位少奶奶對我講日貨的好：</p>
<p>「要呌人用國貨眞不容易，像紡綢又貴又不好看，日本的綢料呢，旣便宜又好看。」</p>
<p>村前村後的中年及老年男子，十分之八都是吸鴉片的，鴉片鬼，這本是我們這個產米之鄉的另一特產。我到家後不久，因爲是一個戒烟的拍籤時季，吸鴉片的大家都在紛紛地議論關於戒姻的一切。</p>
<p>他們都自己承認鴉片烟癮發起來比發寒熱還苦，其中有好幾個已經戒絕而重吸的。</p>
<p>『戒了重吸實在太容易呀！』一個說。</p>
<p>『強迫戒烟還不如禁絕烟的好！』另一個說。</p>
<p>在這些枯瘦的烟鬼的臉色上，反映出中國整個的影子。</p>
<h3>洪慈庵</h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>松山寺的佛號，由對面的密林中傳了出來；音是蒼老的，鬱悶的，—是生之裏嗚啊！</p>
<p>洪慈庵的木魚聲，也跟着一聲聲的　號在交饗若。古老的尼姑庵中，牆上的石灰是剝脫了；兩扇短小的門也像蛀壞了的一樣：東面落掉一塊漆，西面一個洞……。</p>
<p>磬聲繼着木魚的聲音，由霉敗的佛堂中跟着一縷樓的烟絲漏了出來：老尼念經的聲音像生了銹似的，是那麽有氣無力，若斷若續地的。除了老尼的聲音之外：還有一個少尼在尖聲的和着。</p>
<p>念完了經，已是傍晚的時候了。</p>
<p>「唉！這是慈悲？這是出家人的慈悲麽？眞是活受罪哩」！一邊弄着齋飯，一邊自言自語的嘆息着：「師父已經是快進土的了！我自己呢？還祇十八歲哩！這樣過下去，尼姑做到什麽時候才是止境呢……」</p>
<p>「師父給我講什麽西方極樂世界的好處，其實，一個人在生的時候尚且活受罪，誰希罕死後的好處……」</p>
<p>灰黑的四更天，少尼照例的從床上爬了起來；將一領佈滿了塵灰的袈裟無意識如又習慣地的披在身上，她不敢在床上延挨一下來違背老尼固有的嚴令。</p>
<p>長明燈的光和磬聲勾起了她的憶想：彷彿看見了她那一別年餘遠在雲霧里的故鄉和輾轉流離的爺娘；故鄉雖則在連年的兵旱災下毀滅了！爺娘也不知被阜兵災趕到什麽地方去了！然如，就因爲故鄉破碎到不堪收拾，爺娘不知道生死存亡的原故：更易使她春戀着舊時的美夢！回憶着自己未出家時固有的紅妝</p>
<p>到庵中雖然是，一年多了，但她的少女的丰采並沒有被破舊的袈裟及死寂的歲月埋藏</p>
<p>當一把希望之火燄在她內心燃燒着的時候：她是再也禁不住了！弩目的金剛必竟壓不住年靑人求生之願望，牢固的禮教鐵鍊也鎖不住活躍着的年靑之心！她不能讓淚珠跟着手中的佛珠不斷地旋轉，不能讓靑春隨着寥寂的時光消逝！在一個風雪交如的午夜，她鼓足了勇氣叛離了嚴酷的老尼，踏上了一望無涯的生之征途，在開始追求她的新生命。</p>
<h3>西墟夜泊</h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>暮色蒼茫中，船慢慢的靠進西墟南堤。舟子將纜索繫好後，吁了一口悶氣，復忙忙跳進船尾打算生火燒飯。</p>
<p>西墟是媚江沿岸的小墟鎮，位在淞市縣城間的中心；由淞市縣城的水程本要兩天纔走得完，走到西墟剛好是一半路程；在這里泊一晚，明天再走一天就可到縣城了。</p>
<p>在船蓬里侷促了一整天的困悶的心，到此也和舟子放下肩頭的竹篙那麽地輕鬆起來了。</p>
<p>夜，貪婪地從默默無語的山頭流下來；江上，一片迷茫，烟水不分。沿堤過去一列幢幪的樹影，覆蓋着冷靜寒愴的墟市；幾隻船的黑影沉悶地浮在前面堤下，船燈昏黃地倒影在水裏，篩成一條搖拽着的軟軟的火蛇。在夜的黑傘下的西墟，分明已消失了往昔的繁鬧盛況了。</p>
<p>正當晚餐時堤上忽然有人在問。</p>
<p>「是××的船嗎？」</p>
<p>船主眉頭一縐，連忙答應；正待跨出去，船頭上已現出一隻漆着紅黑字的燈籠，昏黃的光影里，照出兩個背着槍的警衛兵，和一個公務員打扮的中年男子。</p>
<p>「到得這樣晚麽，汝們的——」</p>
<p>「是是，剛到不久，艙里坐坐去吧。」</p>
<p>「不不，汝們的保護費——」</p>
<p>「啊，好的，好……」</p>
<p>船主一邊答應着，一邊就伸手到肚兜里，摸索了一會又抬起頭向着公務員打扮的男子，陪着笑。</p>
<p>「唉唉，眞艱難喲，汝先生也明白，現今此不得往常，我，我說就繳一半……」</p>

<p>「不，不是我存心放刁，實在是……」</p>
<p>「我對汝說，我辦公家事，而且也是全爲着汝們船家利益，保護汝們，又不是單爲着那一個！汝想，汝可以繳一半，別家也照樣，那幾十個弟兄吃什麼？」</p>

<p>開篇「聞鈴」</p>
<p>峨嵋山下少人經。苦雨淒風撲面迎。風流天子情難盡。龍淚紛紛泣玉人。昨月馬鬼情太慘。六軍忽地變軍心。早難道三星難照賢妃子。刦數該遭楊太眞。而今追憶長生殿。人影衣香七夕盟。願生同羅帳死同陵。而今香魂艷魄歸何處。翠鳳靑鸞兩地分。教就梨園歌一曲。霓裳從此絕知音。沉香亭有誰與我奏淸平。陳元醴。狠無情。陽奉陰違違朕身。以致於祿山兵變范陽城。從今一別難相見。要見賢妃只好見白綾。喚力士開箱與我取白綾。見綾如見賢妃面。妃子呀。並不是我江山情重美人輕。高力士啟聖君。楊娘娘已死豈能生。請加鞭追趕羊腸道。劍閣聞鈴幾斷魂。杜鵑風雨夜三更。</p>

<h3>加雷古柏所說的影星怕見新聞記者的理由（上）</h3>
<p>— 紉琴</p>
<p>普通的說，電影明星的成就，一般的電影刊物和新聞記者是有很大的功勞的。他們如果沒有這許多刊物和記者，替他們宣傳，十分之九是爲了讀者的興趣，而替他們白盡義務的，他們的名字簡直就很不容易印入一般人的腦中。因此，以常理而論，電影明星對於新聞記者，總是很客氣而重視的。但是，他們亦有不肯接見新聞記者的，亦有不得不接見新聞記者，而視接見新聞記者爲畏途的。加雷古柏就是一個例。</p>
<p>加雷古柏並不是不知新聞記者和他們宣傳工作的價值，但是他卻怕見新聞記者。他的理由很多。現在他爲免除誤會起見，特發表了一篇談話。裏面他對於一般電影明星之所以怕見新聞記者的理由，說得很透澈。我們現在譯它出來，以作新聞記者的借鏡如何？以下就是加雷古柏的談話。</p>
<p>我們做電誚演員的，等到稍為露了些頭角，乙有許多電影刋物的記者來訪問他們了，當乙，這些刋物和寫作人，對於電影從業員的成名，是有極大的帮助的。簡直的說，明星的聲名，是他勿創造出來的。他勿先替我勿寫我勿的簡史，次之乙是我勿怎樣進電影界，怎樣會得到好機會等等。這種材料，經過了多少次的反覆應用之後，他們就開始寫到我們的日常生活，以及其他事項了。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，電誚演員就開始對於這般新聞記者，害怕起來了。他們漸汽車趕涉到我們個人的私生活了。我們所不願意發表的東西，他們亦發表了。不關大眾的事，新聞記者亦非份的揣測着，公諸太衆了。到了最後，我們就不得不採取一種自衛的策略，那就和新聞記者避而不見。</p>
<p>可是，當我們剛發表了不見新聞記者的時候，我們就立即被加上了一個「搭架子」或一驕傲」的頭銜。至於我們爲什麼要不見新聞記者，他們都置之不問了。他們亦沒有想到他們對待電影演員不合理之處，以及那種的宣傳，簡直的是有不如無的地方。他們並且還要說一般電影明星的忘恩負義。他們想着，我們初到好萊塢的時候，是怎樣的喜歡見他們，惟恐他們不來；但是現在我們闊了，用不着他們了，不見他們了等等。其實，這些都是誤會。</p>
<p>當我們不接見新聞記者的時候，我們不能擬就一張名單，誰是可以的，誰是不見的。因此，我們亦祇可以一概不見了。這樣一來，卻就激怒了記者的全體。於是其中就有人，開始向你進攻，說你的壞話了。大家看到了那些攻擊的話，有的懷疑着我們眞的變了，有許多本來喜歡我們的，亦漸漸的冷淡起來了。我是受過以上所述的種種苦處的，我不能不特別的將我個人的態度，表白一下。</p>
<p>我想我的生活，是極平常單調的。我並沒有什麼有聞軼事吿訴人家。但是新聞記者所追求的是特別的故事。倘使他們發表了，我在工作的臼子，早晨七點鐘起床；不工作的臼子，十點鐘起床；用了早膳，就到公司裏去；一直工作到晚；然後回家不出去。那末，人家就會想，這個人都末平凡無味呀，亦有人說，這種故事寫它做什麽呢？這樣，新聞記者要寫我的日常生活，就無法寫我真實的日常生活，而必須去「發明」和「創造」了。</p>
<p>當我還沒有結婚的時候，我亦不免有時和女友出去玩玩，一個男子要和曾經一同出去過的女子，統通結婚，那是不可能的。但是一個男子，一生祗同一個女子出去，亦是絕無僅有的。但是我每次同一個女子出去了一趟，報紙雜誌的閑話攔裏，立即記載下來了。</p>
<p>那還不甚要緊，如果他們不加以按語或揣測的話。但是我所讀到的，往往寫着：「加雷古柏和伊麗斯麥貢昨天晚上在某處某處。伊妮斯是加雷最近的情侶，但加雷是捉摸不定的，伊麗斯是否有本事捉住他呢」？你諫了這段新聞，你說討氣不討氣。到了明天，我和伊麗斯打電話的時候，心中的感想就可想而知了。我忐忑的懷疑着，不知道伊麗斯看見了那段新聞沒有……她會不會生氣的……她會不會懷疑到我有什麽用意的。</p>
<p>如果我不十分難纏的話，過了一天，就有許多新聞記者來見我了。他們在談了許多無關緊要的話之後，就不免提起了伊麗斯的名字。他們問我伊麗斯的人好不好？當然是好的，不然不會同她出去的。第二個問題就是，我要不要娶她爲妻呢？這呌我怎樣回答呢？（未完）</p>
<p>觀眾意見</p>
<h3>重歸「我評」</h3>
<p>— 茅棣</p>
<p>以另一「三個摩登女性」的姿態出現的「重歸」，不得不認爲落伍影片中的前進作品。在題材方面看來，雖然還是屢次所描寫過的失業，災禍，和一些都會裏應有的戀愛，遺棄等等的舊東西，但這正是現社會中普遍的事實，無論鄉邨都市，都在拚命展開着的一慕幕慘狀。可惜導演的手腕太弱了，不能和這些深刻地表現出來，只似乎膚淺地說明了偶然性的現象，成竟可以說介紹了幾個人奏在一起的故事而已。</p>
<p>而且，導演分記這三個主角時膠片，不平均而又不合理，我想至少應該多寫些那個謀獨立生活有淸楚腦筋的姊姊，可是現在大部分的戲，像在爲一個不健全的浪漫姑娘，做一篇三脚貓的傳記，以致觀衆的印象裏，反而覺得這個從舊勢力掙扎過來的女子爲多餘的角色。就是那個淸楚的姊姊，有些地方險些也被誤會了，這種將歸咎於導演的不善去安排這劇本。</p>
<p>本片的主題，與其說是指示婦女生活的正軌，不如說是在崇揚人類底創造力量能克服自然的環境。在這點，畫面上也沒有充分的特徵。</p>
<p>全劇的調子，自始至終永遠是在水平綫，找不出一個高潮，使人猛然刺激一下的地方，沒有高潮的片子，也許會呌人家打瞌睡。</p>
<p>本片的疵點不少，然而也有值得提出的，自殺的塲面頗見技巧，三只歌以在舞塲裏唱的挿得自然。</p>
<p>演員都努力，而范雪朋陸麗霞倆，一是裝不像，一是不到家；陳雁倒還好。（缺章）</p>
<h3>「人倫」觀後</h3>
<p>— 張振</p>
<p>「人倫」一片是明星公司繼「狂流」後的一部新的力作，以其新的作風，正確的意識，將整個目前不平衡的社會經濟制度下的殘酷實現，用客觀的嚴肅正視的態度將牠暴露出來，這確是劇作者的成功，不過所可遺憾，所暴露的尚不够，</p>
<p>「人倫」是描寫一個刻苦的碼頭工人，因遭火災而傷其子，因經濟窘困，求醫被拒。因此他余三（稼農飾）就想走向歧途上而求出路，可是結果被法律的制裁而入獄，出獄後，他的妻子已嫁陸大雄兒子也在他的銀行裏的工作，余三開始他的馬路上的流浪生活，後又由睹友雨明介紹充其子之僕役，最後雨明陰謀暴發，余三爲救其子，反死於巡警槍彈下，</p>
<p>演員龔稼農之賣力，這是任何人不雄否認的。他的成功就是他能賣力。他的過去的印象我們在「狂流」中尚可回憶得到。這次由他的化裝的逼眞，內心的深刻的表情，較以往的過去一切的片子。可算是最成功的了。</p>
<p>這次在「人倫」中除去龔稼農之外尚一個新人——袁紹梅飾余林氏）他能以初上銀幕而飾三個不同時代的角色，是不可多得的。</p>
<p>關於攝影方面，當然有些地方不能使人滿意。但是陳君也是一個新的人物，他有如此的成續，也是很可慶幸的。光綫方面尚好不過有些地方不清是，尚無大碍。（缺章）</p>
<h3>電通風光一瞥</h3>
<p>一·周伯勳爲了「自由神」拍取外景，需向各方面接洽，巳於星期日先赴杭州。司徒慧敏·王瑩，張雲喬三人，乘着今晨的早車，由滬向杭州駛去。至於開麥拉，道具和工作人員們，載在電通的一輛卡車里趕去，已是第三批人了。</p>
<p>二·風雲兒女」中有談瑛與袁牧之的Kiss鏡頭，本來早已拍過，但導演許幸之，爲精益求精，也顧不了談瑛的怕羞，又連試了三次。這雖是和談瑛爲難，而「我們的詩人」袁牧之，却連中三元，大交其桃花運。</p>
<p>三·電通第四部聲片「都會風光」的女主角，爲了貫澈初衷，　取新人材計，已登報公開招聘。連日報名的異常踴躍，在無意中，電通又將掘得一新人矣。</p>
<p>四·春雨連綿，電通的水門汀的籃球塲上，也蓋上了一片片的水潭。一般的球兒們，被天氣悶得難受，都湧進了乒乓室　那兒，立刻顯出一陣蓬勃的氣象。</p>
<h3>吳村與「落花時節」</h3>
<p>— 尤光</p>
<p>吳村以重婚一片，而在中國的銀壇上得到了很好的嘉譽。</p>
<p>他的手法是輕鬆的，畫面是美麗的，每一尺膠片，都深含着詩意。</p>
<p>落花時節從這個詩意的題名看來，很容易使我們想起這一定是一部傷感憂悒的戀愛故事了，而實際上，它的主題是反帝的。它描一羣，因爲糧食軍火不濟，因而敗退下來，流浪到大都市中來的義勇軍。他們　飢餓的脅迫頑強地擻抖着，永遠不頹唐；他們愛說笑話，愛鬧，也算因女人吃過酣，可是到戰爭二次爆發的時候，他們却又站在一條戰綫上了。</p>
<p>該片酌編劇導演，都是吳村，主演者有沈來，雖　農，趙丹，王獻齊，顧梅君，顧蘭君等。（卻）</p>

<h3>雲天恨塞（Living　on　Velvet）（四）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>若不多時候已經到了明天早晨兩點鐘，他們二人仍舊在外徊徉着沒有回家。這個時候，他們正在一輛食品車上吃牛肉餅。那位賣吃食的，卻並不以有生意而高奮。他覺得這般高等士女們，連打烊的時候都不知道，實在太討厭了。但他又不好趕他們下去。於是他說道：「今天早晨很好呀。」脫雷聽了，不懂得他的意思，反駁他道：「好像要下　似的。」那車主人又說道：「但是報上的預告是天晴和暖呀。」脫雷道：「那末我們還是求雨吧。」愛梅亦說道：「我喜歡下雨。」說着他們二人仍奮不走。車主人沒有法子，祇可以隨仰們去。</p>
<p>一回兒，脫雷似有所悟的喊道：一笑話，我們還沒有通過姓名哩。」愛梅道：「你的名字我早就知道了。你是脫雷派克。我一看見你就知道的因爲華德和我提起過你。「脫雷聽了，跳起來道：「那末你是誰？」愛梅奇怪道：「在魷是愛梅你還不知道嗎？」</p>
<p>脫雷聽了，像像失了什麽東西似的，精神頓時萎了下去。過了一回，他自言自語道。。）當然，你就是愛梅……華德的愛梅……愛梅道：「光是愛梅就是了。」脫雷還是自言自語道：「第五街上有一盞電燈，中央公園裏有一片樹葉，紐約就有一個女人。幾千萬盞燈，幾千萬個女子，但是你剛巧是華德的愛梅。」愛梅道：「我不是什麽華德不華德的。」脫雷道：「但是他是愛你的。」愛梅道：「並不怎樣厲害呀。」脫雷道：「當然你亦愛他的。「愛梅道：亦不看得怎樣。」</p>
<p>他們二人於是站起來，回家去了。他們二人一路亦沒有講什麽話。脫電將愛梅送到她家裏的時候，賓客已經散了，但是華德還沒有走。愛梅看見了華德走到他面前拍着他的　道：「我知道我們不應該走開的。請你聽恕我吧。」脫雷站在一旁，冷眼看着他們二人，不覺說了一聲：「好一對情人！」就向他們道了曉安，獨自一個人悄然地走開了。</p>
<p>到了明天，愛梅一個人坐在家裏。她一天沒有吃什麽東西。她所想念的就是脫雷……他昨晚臨走時的神氣，巳經穿不可拔的印在她的腦中。吃過了晚飯，華德來了。愛梅心中懷着無限的希望迎了上去，但是華德卻向她微微搖着頭。愛梅手裏正拿着一支紙烟，還沒有點。她不覺將那支煙紙紙得粉碎碎她。她然地說道地說道，你一定要尋着他……你明白嗎？不　到不興……華德道「我明白……我再去　去。」</p>
<p>愛梅伸出乎來，和他握着道：「我真對不住你……華德道：「沒有什麼。你愛他，我知道了祇要你快活，我亦快活的。」愛梅聽了，眼淚差不多要奪眍而出了，她忍了淚說道：「你是世界上最有義氣的人了。你會　到他的，是不是？」華德道：「不錯，我去導他去。」</p>
<p>華德眞是好人。他不久　到了脫　，將他帶家裏。脫雷正在洗澡，而愛梅已經得到了消息，分鐘都等不及的趕了來。她就和脫雷在浴　之中見面了，他們非但見面，並且訂了婚約。不管她的姑母瑪莎的抗議，她竟和脫雷在一所教望禮結了婚，而華德就是他們惟一的證婚人。（未完）</p>

<h3>美國汽車生產力增進</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>與昔年旺盛時期相埒</p>
<p>美國的汽車製造業。近來很有飛突猛進的現象。據地德羅消息。本年三月份的美國汽車出產。將與四年九個月前的產量相彷彿。自從一千九百三十年五月份以來。就是五十七個月之前。汽車和運貨汽車的產量。從來沒有達到四〇〇·〇〇〇輛之數的。這個三月份。據觀察者的意想。汽車產量不但將和上面所講的水平數目相同。並且還要超過哩。所以照這樣看起來。三月份每個禮拜的平均總產額。勢將在一〇〇·〇〇〇輛左右。目下一個禮拜方纔結束。生產的數量還沒有計算出來。然而事實上。已允爲自從五天工作一星期成爲法定後。第一次得達那個數目的時期。</p>
<p>無論那一個月份。如果汽車的產量超過四〇〇·〇〇〇輛的數字的。那末統計家便視爲超越平常狀態了。在一千九百三十年的時候。這樣的月份祇有三個。那就是三月四月及五月。一九二九年大家都算爲汽車業的壯盛年頭。那年共有這樣的九個月。一九二八年共有八個。一九二七年祇有三個。一九二六年六個。一九二五年的汽車產量約達四百萬輛。有超出數的月份共有五個。</p>
<p>各汽車廠每星期的生產力重返一〇〇·〇〇〇輛時。各廠的首腦人物便一方面計劃一個很小心的步驟。避免昔日因生產過剩而得到的困苦重見於今日。目下大家都相信在百業之中，汽車製造業可稱爲一枝中流砥柱。主要的廠家。生產量一步一步的向上增加。又據各方報告。零售商的營業也隨看上昇。不過廠方鑒於市面上不穩定。像股票行市的跌落等情。也就非常的小心謹慎。其他廠方小心的理由。是鑒於外國的混亂情狀。物產市塲的顯然跌落。和復興政策之前途茫茫等。都使各廠的執行人員。不無担心之處。</p>
<p>計劃及製造新式汽車之機師。對於車輛交通上。顯然同趨於相仿傾向之肇禍案件。大爲疑奇。此種肇禍案件之發生。卽富有駕駛經騐者亦所難免。蓋據事實上之調查。肇禍案件中常有不少之駕駛老手。犧牲其中也。一般人深信。此種事件之發生。大半由於駕駛者對於汽車機械結構方面。掉以輕心所致。而不知其所駕駛之汽車。與彼七八年前所習用者迥不相同也。今日所見之汽車。其引拏機力及速率方面。以視七八年前者。乃常在增進之中。其煞車及其他安全設備之裝置。均極相稱。所惜者吾人心智上之缺點。不是汽車機師所得而管理的。在這一點上疏忽的人。就往往闖下大禍。把性令也送掉。在一九二七年至一九三四年間。據估計制動機的平均馬力。已從六十五。八匹上昇至一百十二·五匹。今年情形略有不同。又跌至一〇九·六匹馬力·</p>
<p>美國汽車工程學會印第亞那分會。最近舉行會議。那城裏的工程師李哇爾特飛爾氏。曾經提出一個問題來討論。他的意思。一九三四和一九三五年式新車。增高了許多機力。沒有震蕩。非常安靜。可是在肇禍方面。恐怕要有增無減。反而增加。駕駛汽車者因爲用慣舊式車子。一旦更改。未免困難隨之。還有因爲行動安穩的關係。又加以機力加增至最高限度。彼亦漠然不知。對於速率計不加注意。將車於高速度中轉灣。且經考騐結果。當車轉灣過速時。有若電光一閃。不知車身重量之是否平衡。及至覺察。則已無及矣云云。</p>

<p>任何液體。要使牠蒸發成氣體。都非加以相當的熱不可。汽車的化油系亦當如此。就目前市上發售供汽車所用的汽油而論。其中僅一極小部份能雊在尋常大氣溫度中蒸發。卽使在盛夏天氣。也是如此。平常的汽汕中。除了這一極小部份容易蒸發外。其餘的。若含有最重的分子在內。其沸點最高會達到華氏四百五十度。所以爲要得到汽油的正當蒸發。與適宜的噴霧。而使燃料節省。須將汽油加以相當的熱。通常這種熱之加施。都在汽油旣蒸發了以後。</p>
<p>在人前　汽油中所含容易蒸發的分子。此難以蒸發的分子多。故這種汽　。無論在什麼地方。都能適用。和這種汽油先將未入化油機的宅氣使熱。再將化汕機混合室　以水套。並進氣管也以水套套之。遂後讓發動機冷卻系的水。在這水套內循環。就能得到最滿意的結果。這種水套裏的水。平常鮮花超過華氏一百七十度。這樣的低溫度。若用於蒸發現在所含較多不易蒸發分子的汽油。那就不適用了。話雖如此。這種用水套加熱的方法。較之往臼全沒加熱設備的化汕機。是進步多多了。</p>
<p>至於將尚在流質質時的汽油。效果也很好。因爲汽油中所含較輕分子的蒸發。能藉此受到不少帮助。而燃料更加經濟。自遢意中之事。於是。在用真空罐給汕的汽車。因爲要使罐中的汽油被發動機汽缸所發射出來的熱氣溫熱起見。眞空罐的地位務使越靠近發動機及化油　越好。關於流體汽油加熱。這個問題。曾經有人試騐。將化油機浮筒室裏的汽油。利用　電池供給的電流經過一個生熱的綫圈來加熱。結果。對於起動冷的發動時。證明非常成功。現在有幾種化油機。業已裝置這種電力初給機（Electric　primer）。但是。像這種加熱設·備。祇可爲起動發動機時用之。因爲牠所需耗費電量極大。假使不問斷的使用。則蓄電池裏的電流。將於片刻之間用盡。（未完）</p>
<h3>赫德森與地上飛一致採用雙流潤滑系</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>關於汽車引擎之種種檢騐工作。要當以赫德森機械工程部所採用者。最爲嚴格而艱難。此蓋第特洛城所一致推許。並爲一般人所公認者。距今不久以前。一九三五年式地上飛引擎一架。又已完成一種二〇八小時之測騐。於此測騐中。所應用之引擎速度。適等於每小時八十四英里。假令以此引擎。裝配於汽車上。則其行程。於九天內。當可達一七四七二英里。換言之。卽以每小時八十四英里之速率。中途並不停頓或減速。作橫貫美洲之行。可達六次之多也。按此種測騐。據赫德森工程師之意。對於潤滑系。尤有莫大關係。於此試騐中。每一活塞行程。等於七八七八英里。凸輸軸轉動二四，九六〇，〇〇〇次。拐軸轉動四九，九二〇，〇〇〇次。其餘各部之持久動作亦皆稱是。惟雖經此艱鉅工作。但引擎拆卸時。固絕無何種影響。或損及其分毫也。又如接連桿下端軸承。於此種試騐時。每首當其衝。但結果其平均磨損程度。尚不足一萬分之三寸。至於活塞則毫無所損。而所有活塞梢上之承軸面。亦皆完好如常　凡此種種。蓋皆盡美盡善之潤滑系。有以使其然也。按其所應用之潤滑系。爲雙流式。係以雙重動作之往還邦浦。經拐軸之兩端以分配機油。並經導管以至油槽。於是由接連桿下端部份集合之。以絕大壓力。如油於一切必要部份。赫德森與地上飛引擎之動作效能。所以卓絕羣倫者。此種潤滑系。蓋卽其特色之一也。引擎一經發動。機油遂卽傳達於一切動作部份。卽此一端。蓋卽赫德森雙流潤滑系逈不可及之一顯著優點也。</p>
<h3>美國汽車廠所謂「送上船」價格</h3>
<p>美國汽車廠所謂某一輛汽車的「送上船」價格F．O．B．　Factory　Price是八百五十元。</p>
<p>實際上照此價格。不能買到這輛汽車。在美國。如果汽車的「送上船」完價是一千元或不到一千元。其送到的價格往往比「送上船」高起約百分之二十五。假定有一輛價格較高之汽車。其「送上船」價格是一零二六元。則在紐約須出價一一七三元。方可購得。卽增加約百分之十四。</p>
<p>各國汽車界。凡欲將美國汽車「送上船」價格與送到價格比較。應該記到上面所舉的事實。而且應該注意汽車零售商或推銷員。倘彼輩利用美國汽車之定價。以破壞同行。務勿受其欺朦。因爲美國汽車之定價。係專指一輛空車。旣無保險槓。又無預備胎。而此兩物在汽車爲必需之件。其他在現在情形下必不可少之零件。亦有不備者。</p>
<p>美國汽車在「關上船」的價格所有之設備。因各車牌子向異。大概安全玻璃。前張保修險槓。時鐘。預備胎。雙尾燈。雙喇唋等件。多不包括在內。在事實上。沒有一個人在美國能照定價買到一輛汽車。至若海外各國之須另加運稅保險等費者。更不容說了。</p>
<p>偶或有一個美國人。跑到汽車廠中。要求照定價買一輛車。但終不免出些小費。而且須將照會帶去。還要說了許多道德上的好話。才能將汽車開走。凡全安方面必不可少的幾件東西。都能配好。</p>
<p>美國汽車的定價。原來不過是一種核算的根據。用以指明各車所應歸列之類別。並非是各該車之實價。然而只爲了這個定價。海外汽車界。在各種雜誌刊物上看見以後。就引起許多疑惑。起</p>
<h3>上爲一九三五年式英國史丹達汽車座位寬敞一望而知</h3>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>了疑惑。遂不免對於汽車進口商行發生批評。因爲美國的所謂定價。與海外售價。顯然不能一致。</p>
<p>要知美國人所付之車價。比較海外所付之車價。確是低些。但這並不是由於廠方之過失。亦並不是由於進口商行之過失。其故一部份在於出口貿易上之特別需要。一部份由於包裝。運輸。稅餉等另加之費。而其中以稅餉爲最大。</p>
<p>有許多美國汽車廠。對於出口汽車。往往格外討好。如配備特別之轉向節及彈簧等件。使能適應海外市塲之道路狀況。</p>
<p>定價上旣加起了運輸及稅餉等費則其在海外價格。將二倍於在美國之定價。或竟過之。然在進口商行。並不於中取利。因爲進口商之賺錢。以全部投資爲準。並非專以在汽車上之投資爲準。徜進口商專在汽車價格上取利百分之二十五。而對於運費稅餉。不求獲利。則其結果。僅獲得百分之十五的毛利。實際上必遭虧本矣。</p>
<p>數年以前。有一著名汽車廠。改變政策。所開價格並非是送上船之價。乃是送到某幾個大城之價。卒受大失敗。</p>
<p>然而改革之議。業正衆口同辭。無論出口行家及本國行家。多數均主張澈底改革。放棄「送上船」價格。屬特廠營業主任柯林君最近在第特祿扶輸會中發言曰「我們不要設（你有九百元可買一輛汽車。但你若要一輛完全的汽車。則須付一千二百元）等語」。</p>
<p>許多國外的分銷處亦對此制度。深惡而痛絕。因爲易致引起誤會。不用腦　之汽車顧客。偶在美國雜誌上看見了定價表。便卽立下速斷。以爲進口商索價過苛。深致不滿。因此之故。美國的出口商。亦欲籌謀改革。以圖挽救。</p>
<p>或主張將汽車定價。禁止在出口刊物上登載。然一部份出口行家不以爲然。因登載以後。能使分銷處不敢弋取不正當之利益。且出口行家縱不登載。其他刊物必刊登。故雖禁無益。</p>
<p>最要之法莫如使海外汽車界對於美國「送上船」價格澈底明瞭。要知這種價格不過是一個根據。由此根據。可以計算車主須付之實價。並可以表示各種價格之門類。</p>

<h3>Swire Company in Xiamen Has Moved into New Warehouse Yesterday, There Is Still Hope for Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) The Swire Company and its warehouse moved from Haihou to the new warehouse on Tongwen Road on the 23rd, officially hanging up its sign for business. According to foreign sources, the British Minister and the Xiamen Consulate have not yet received documents from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Lin Shaonan, the Foreign Affairs Inspector of Fujian and Zhejiang, regarding this case. The Swire Company moved to the new warehouse after obtaining formal long-term lease procedures from the local government and performing in accordance with the original contract, so it is not convenient to stop it. If the Chinese diplomatic authorities have any objections to this, it can still be resolved peacefully. In addition, the water transportation groups oppose the new Swire warehouse because the flying bridges allow passengers and cargo to land directly, affecting the lives of boat workers, which is different from the opposition to the long-term lease from all walks of life. An agreement has been reached with the company that the conditions proposed will not be implemented until a reply is received from the London headquarters, and each vessel will not dock at the new warehouse for the time being.

<h3>Eradicating Illiteracy Among Women and Promoting Phonetic Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Our country's movement to eradicate illiteracy did not begin today. It actually came with the reform and educational movement. It has now been thirty years in history. In the late Guangxu period, the Qing court was preparing for constitutionalism and had a plan to establish simple literacy schools by year. The Provisional Education Conference of the Republic of China in the first year passed a proposal to adopt phonetic alphabet. In its resolution, there was a statement: "Education should be universal, and writing should be applicable to the general people, not just for a few talented individuals." Thus, literacy education had a solid foundation. During the "May Fourth" Movement, the popular education movement was at its peak. The call to eliminate illiteracy spread throughout the country. Those who promoted the National Language Education Movement also spared no effort in promoting the phonetic alphabet. It is a pity that politics were not on the right track, and promotion was difficult to be effective, resulting in very little effect.</p>
<p>Since the rise of the National Revolutionary Movement, with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to "awaken the masses," the literacy movement has been listed as one of the important tasks of party and government agencies. In the seventeenth year, the central government stipulated the outline of grassroots work, with the literacy movement prominently at the top. In the eighteenth year, the Central Propaganda Department promulgated the outline of literacy movement propaganda first, and the Ministry of Education of the National Government formulated the outline of the literacy movement plan propaganda later. However, since the promulgation of the magnificent decree, although various provinces and cities have successively held it, it has not been able to be fully implemented in practice. This is also something that cannot be denied. Therefore, the central government has recently stepped up its supervision, and various provinces and cities have revitalized their spirits and are planning to carry out earnestly. The Shanghai Municipal Government, when holding an expanded memorial week on the fifteenth of this month, announced a method of implementing compulsory education through city-wide mobilization starting on July 1, and the mayor led the entire staff to swear an oath to express their determination.</p>
<p>We cannot help but admire the government authorities for this spirit of redoubled efforts and a firm and resolute attitude. However, having learned that the literacy movement has been going on for thirty years without considerable achievement, I humbly wish that those in charge of the literacy movement, when designing and promoting it now, will carefully consider the reasons why the literacy movement is not easy to achieve and determine a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons why the literacy movement is not easy to achieve, although there are not just one aspect, I believe that the biggest problem lies in the difficulty of teaching and learning Chinese characters. The key to breaking this difficulty is clearly indicated in the central government's order to change the name of the "phonetic alphabet" to "phonetic symbols." The text briefly says: "Considering that Chinese characters have many advantages, their disadvantage is that they lack phonetic notation, which is inconvenient for children and illiterate people to practice in the initial stage. Therefore, the Japanese assisting Chinese writing with kana has become the best tool for popularity." "The Ministry of Education previously issued the phonetic alphabet... which is the same as kana, only suitable for phonetic notation, not for creating characters... It should be renamed phonetic symbols to match its name and reality. It is only phonetic notation, not character creation. There is no need to excessively reduce the number of symbols and set up many spelling rules. For advanced knowledge and important contracts, the tones of the sounds and the similarities and differences of the meanings are all the responsibility of Chinese characters. There is no need to add extra distinctions to the phonetic symbols. In this way, only dozens of simple symbols will be known to literate people in three days and can become teachers. Illiterate people can graduate after learning for a maximum of ten days. And with these dozens of symbols, national pronunciation can be noted, local pronunciation can be noted, it can be noted next to the characters, or it can be used alone to note the words spoken. It is suitable for both left and right, no sound cannot be noted, no language cannot be conveyed. It will give popular education the greatest and fastest effect." From this, we can see that phonetic symbols are actually a sharp tool for the success of the literacy movement. It is a pity that the literacy movement in recent years has this sharp tool but has not been able to make full use of it.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the Ministry of Education has adopted the proposals of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee and is starting to cast copper molds of phonetic Chinese characters. It will limit the publishing industry to compile and print elementary school textbooks, children's books, and popular books, all of which should use phonetic Chinese characters. If this move can be realized, it is truly good news for the future of the literacy movement. However, since the Ministry of Education's plan was released, there have been many criticisms. And the funds raised to implement this plan are limited and insufficient for deployment. This may have an impact on the future promotion. Here, we believe that the large-scale literacy movement that all regions are eagerly implementing this time and the plan to promote phonetic Chinese characters that the Ministry of Education is working on should achieve close cooperation. Those in the literacy movement should do their best to help promote phonetic Chinese characters. For those who criticize the plan to promote phonetic Chinese characters, they can answer with the principle that "education should be universal, and writing should be applicable to the general people, not just for a few talented individuals." In order for the literacy movement to be promoted as effectively as possible, the Ministry of Education should expand its plan to promote phonetic Chinese characters in order to break through the difficulties that have made the literacy movement difficult to achieve in the past.</p>
<h3>Successful Trial Flight to Honolulu - "Oriental" Plane Flies Back to the United States - Once Way Stations Along the Route are Completed, American-Asian Airmail Service Will Be Established Immediately</h3>
<p>Honolulu - The "Oriental Flying" plane departed from here today and flew back to the coast of California. The plane carried more than 4,000 letters, which is the first airmail from the Hawaiian Islands to the United States mainland. The plane departed at 3:29 p.m. today. The United American Airlines authorities did not announce this news in advance, so less than 100 people from Honolulu went to the airport to watch the plane take off. The plane was equipped with 2,800 gallons of gasoline and 100 gallons of engine oil, which is enough for 2,400 miles of flight. The company authorities are very happy with the successful flight. It is said that the airmail route from California to China can be established as soon as the airfields in Midway, Wake, and Guam are built. However, according to news from Washington, the Senate has rejected the $2 million proposal to promote Sino-American airmail service. The proposal was originally for the development of naval bases on the above-mentioned three islands, but government leaders believe that the government does not have an appropriate investigation into this airmail plan, so it should not allocate funds. Democratic Senator Reynolds also said that the Post Office Department already has a budget for Sino-American airmail service that can be self-sufficient. If it flies back and forth once a week, it will cost US$1.8 million per year, and the income from the postal service is enough to cover it. As for the postage for Sino-American airmail, according to the temporary postage table announced yesterday, each letter from the United States to Hawaii is US$0.25, to Manila US$0.50, and to Guangzhou US$0.60.

Itagaki said in the car that the purpose of his trip to Tokyo this time was to attend the Chief of Staff meeting to be held on the 1st of next month. We cannot agree with the issue of setting up a demilitarized zone on the Russian-Manchurian border, because in actual combat, the 40-meter demilitarized zone is the same as nothing. The Soviet Union is now gathering 250,000 troops on the border and constantly preparing for war. We would rather organize a joint committee of Japan, Russia, and Manchuria to stipulate the border line, so that the Soviet Union can change its Far East policy and abolish its military preparations on the border.

<h3>May 1st Labor Day - Soviet Union Prepares for Celebration - Workers Throughout the Country Take Holidays in Sequence - Central Executive Committee Will Promote Political Platform</h3>
<p>(Moscow) May 1st is International Labor Day. The Soviet Union will hold a celebration on this day. Workers throughout the country will take several days off.

This year, 52 propaganda slogans will be published, of which 9 are about foreign affairs. The others are about the Red Army, internal affairs, economy, peasant issues, cultural issues, and the eradication of the "remnants of the opposition." The foreign affairs slogans express the Soviet Union's desire for peace, attack fascism, and praise the German working class and "Chinese workers." The Red Army and Navy are respected as "defenders of the motherland." These slogans are the most recent to be used in the Soviet Union and are quite noteworthy. In addition, there are also slogans such as "Oppose Corruption and Bureaucracy" and "Implement Soviet Democracy." (Havas Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Saito Promotes US Relations - Says Japan Has No Intention of Monopolizing the Chinese Market - Reciprocal Trade Between Japan and the United States Can Avert the Scourge of War</h3>
<p>Lickymon - Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, gave a speech to the Women's Association today, predicting that the benefits of reciprocal trade will allow Japan and the United States to escape the vortex of war. He also said that trade between Japan and the United States is of great importance to both countries and must not be sacrificed in war. Therefore, even if there are no other reasons, the benefits of this reciprocal trade are enough to allow the two countries to avoid the scourge of war. Japan's position in the Far East should occupy a special position due to strategic relations, but this is not Japan's attempt to monopolize China's commerce. Saito also said that Japan supports China's open door policy and does not intend to take any action to interfere with this traditional commercial custom. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>German Social Democratic Leaders Gather for Discussion - Decide to Establish an Invincible Air Force - Unwilling to Succumb to Geneva - Political Isolation is Insignificant - Hitler Will Reaffirm His Position</h3>
<p>(Berlin) If Germany can establish an air force equal to the strongest country in Europe, then political isolation is actually insignificant. This attitude has now been adopted by the German government. Führer Hitler is still in his mountain villa discussing everything with the national leaders of the National Socialist Party and government leaders. An impartial observer close to the government leaders described the situation, saying that Germany cannot succumb to Geneva's various tactics at present. Even if other countries object, Germany will continue to increase the strength of its air force. Hitler firmly believes that after the air force is invincible, whether other countries are willing or not, they will certainly allow Germany's demand for complete equality. However, it is reported that there are still two factions in the government. One faction advocates a tough response to the League of Nations, while the other believes that it is appropriate to deal with it calmly. On the one hand, they are still manufacturing aircraft. It is expected that Hitler will supplement his gentle protest against the League of Nations in three or two days. Hitler may reaffirm Germany's position, explaining Germany's enthusiasm for peace, but feels that without international equality, peace will not be ensured. Officials are very happy with the temporary suspension of Franco-Russian negotiations. It is said that the government is very concerned about world sentiment and will not make any policy decisions until it has considered the opinions of various countries.

<h3>Germany Actively Prepares for War - Secretly Establishes Airfields Across the Country - Ambition to Advance Eastward is Obvious - A Famous French Reporter Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>(Paris) The famous French reporter, Lucien, who is familiar with the situation of Germany's military preparations, has recently written an article commenting on Germany's war preparations and secretly setting up airfields. This article will be published in the Mariana Weekly, which will be published tomorrow. The article cites the British White Paper on National Defense, the facts discovered by Stett, the editor-in-chief of The Times, and the German military requirements published by the "Little Parisian Newspaper" 18 months ago. In addition, most of the materials were provided by Mrs. Woodman of England. Mrs. Woodman is the secretary of the British Democratic Supervision Association and is a well-known expert in military affairs. Lucien's article briefly states that according to various statistics, Germany has 62 airfields, but according to official documents, Germany actually has 258 airfields, and this number is the minimum, because the 2,500 German aviation sports organizations have opened many airfields. In addition, there are sports grounds and racecourses everywhere that can be used for landing aircraft, and all lakes can be used for landing seaplanes. Most of the recently built airfields have factories, barracks, and underground hangars. Sixteen aircraft can take off simultaneously from the rotating airfield. Most of these airfields are built in forests far from cities and are concealed and kept secret. In addition, Lucien also listed the names of German flying squadron officers. As for the German aircraft's attack bases, those set up in the Cologne area and Münster, Hanover, and Kiel are for attacking the United Kingdom. Those set up in Cologne, Darmstadt, Sengcheng, and Nuremberg are for attacking France. If Italy is attacked from Bavaria or Württemberg, it can be reached in a few hours, because the distance from Sengcheng to Rome is only 700 kilometers, and the distance from Sengcheng to Trieste, Italy, is only 320 kilometers, and it takes less than an hour to fly from Sengcheng to northern Italy. In addition, the Czech Republic is surrounded by the air force in Upper Silesia, Saxony, and Bavaria. Although Germany and Poland have good relations, Germany has built many airfields in East Prussia, which is absolutely unnecessary in terms of civil transportation. The threat to the Baltic countries is even worse, because the defense capabilities of the Baltic countries are very weak and can be invaded at any time. However, the main purpose of Germany's aerial invasion is the Soviet Union, which can be seen from the fact that German airfields are moving towards the eastern border.

<p>(Paris) A well-known stockbroker in London recently told the Economic and Financial Communications Agency that Germany has a large amount of money stored abroad for war, at least 500 million pounds, mostly stored in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States, specifically for the purchase of raw materials and the funds to implement rearmament. German Minister of Economy Dr. Schacht has repeatedly declared to the outside world that Germany lacks current currency, using this as an excuse to default on debts. This is nothing more than a way to delay time so as to complete the plan to strengthen the military and prepare for war. The broker also said that he still remembers that in 1923, the German banks in South America, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile entrusted him to sell a large number of marks. At that time, the credit of German currency in the commercial market had not fallen, so there was no worry about finding a buyer. The estimated amount of the transaction was about 100 million pounds. This huge amount was immediately transferred to the German authorities and secretly stored in a safe place under a pseudonym. (Havas Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Defensive Mutual Assistance Pact: French-Russian Negotiations Stalled, French Experts Study Solutions to Difficulties, Avoiding Conflicts with Britain and Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to sources here, the Soviet Russian government gazette stated that Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov's negotiations with French Foreign Minister Laval had been temporarily suspended. Litvinov had returned to Moscow to report everything to the People's Committee. News of this surprised various circles in France, as the gazette did not mention when the negotiations would resume. Furthermore, according to French authorities, the negotiations naturally ceased when Litvinov returned to the Russian capital. It is noted that Litvinov and Laval had resolved the main points in their previous talks, and only a few points in the articles remained unresolved when Litvinov departed. According to a French gazette, Litvinov wanted to report to the Soviet Russian People's Committee, and Laval would also report to the French cabinet. However, opinions differed more in the Soviet Russian side than in France. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Difficulties have arisen in the proposed Franco-Russian defensive mutual assistance pact, causing negotiations to temporarily stall. Today, French legal experts are meeting to study ways to eliminate these difficulties. French diplomats are keen to preserve the original intention of the Franco-Russian agreement while avoiding conflicts with Britain and France. According to the draft agreement, if either Russia or France is subjected to any aggression by another country, they will implement military mutual assistance. Therefore, the proposed formal treaty is broader in scope than the air defense mutual assistance pact advocated by British Foreign Secretary Simon. The French side intends to sign this agreement before the opening of the Rome conference in mid-May, and an agreement with Czechoslovakia is also planned. However, it is heard that Britain and Italy may oppose such separately signed military alliances, hindering France's plan. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian officials today remained silent regarding the temporary suspension of Franco-Russian military agreement negotiations. However, Soviet Russian newspapers prominently published dispatches from Paris stating that the reason for the temporary suspension was that France felt it necessary to submit the agreement to the League of Nations for final approval. Soviet Russian officials believed that the sooner the agreement was signed, the better. Since returning from Geneva, Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov has neither confirmed nor denied the current state of affairs regarding this matter. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers have rarely commented on the temporary suspension of Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact negotiations. The right-wing newspaper "White Day" expressed no dissatisfaction with the matter, stating, "According to the news released by TASS, the Franco-Russian negotiations have now been temporarily suspended. This is precisely the opportunity we desire, as we must have considerable time to consider what Russia is requesting." The newspaper "Free Man" stated, "Between France and Russia lie Germany and Poland. Any words or actions between France and Russia must take Germany and Poland into account. The reason why the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact has been delayed is likely because the two countries have not fully considered Germany and Poland. Even if the pact is completed, what value does it have if Poland obstructs its implementation?" The "Paris Echo" stated that if France wants to conclude a security pact, then it is necessary to sign a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union. As long as this pact is not concluded, the Little Entente countries will not agree to negotiate the Danube Pact. A reporter from the "Little Parisian" newspaper in Moscow stated, "Except for a small number of foreigners, no one believes in the breakdown of Franco-Russian negotiations. Although officials in the Soviet Union remain secretive, they only say that the suspension of talks is temporary. As for the Franco-Russian cooperation policy, it will definitely not be affected."</p>
<h3>French Renowned Reporter Criticizes Laval's Diplomacy: The Unity of Three Nations Has Not Become a Powerful Tool, Hesitation and Indecisiveness Have Led to a Loss of Essential Authority</h3>
<p>(Paris) Morning News reporter Botinard strongly criticized French policy after the Stresa and Geneva conferences, stating that the results of the Stresa conference proved that the unity of Britain, France, and Italy had failed to become a powerful tool. Britain still intends to refuse to bear responsibility for the European continent. At the end of January, the British Foreign Office planned to restore the pre-war Entente, but due to opposition from overseas territories, domestic public opinion, and other cabinet members, Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon may have been prepared to reaffirm the obligations of the Locarno Treaty. However, the treaty itself has become a dead letter after several changes, and the League of Nations has failed to stop minor aggressions. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated last month that the League of Nations can only stop wars when great powers do not need wars. Therefore, the only thing that can be done today is for France, Russia, Russia, Czechoslovakia, France, and Italy to separately conclude mutual assistance pacts. However, the most important Franco-Russian pact has now suffered a setback. Foreign Minister Laval's hesitation and indecisiveness have led to a loss of his essential authority. Now, only direct talks between Mussolini of Italy, Benes of Czechoslovakia, Titulescu of Romania, and Yevtic of Yugoslavia can preserve the Danube conference. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>French Troops Concentrated on the German Border</h3>
<p>(Paris) Dozens of special trains filled with thousands of new recruits departed for the vicinity of the Rhine River today. This is part of the French Ministry of the Army's concentration plan. These new recruits are draftees who enlisted after the French cabinet passed the new conscription law, numbering between 115,000 and 120,000. Most of them will undergo one year of rigorous military training, but in the event of an emergency, their term of military service will be automatically extended. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Polish Government Newspaper Denies Secret German-Polish Agreement</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Foreign sources have reported that Poland has entered into a secret agreement with Germany. The French newspapers "Paris Echo" and "Lyon National Welfare" have disclosed the details of the agreement. The government-affiliated "Daily Express" has once again denied this, stating, "Such news should be regarded as a deliberate attempt aimed at creating an atmosphere in Western Europe unfavorable to Poland."

<h3>Threatened by Germany, Lithuania Prepares its Military, Army Strength Increased to 20,000</h3>
<p>Lithuanian Capital: The Lithuanian government is currently increasing its army's armaments and troop numbers in order to cope with Germany's rearmament in East Prussia. To date, only one-third of Lithuanian conscripts have been enlisted for service. The government has now decided to form the remaining one-third and other reservists into special divisions. Furthermore, the government recently decided to retain soldiers who were due to be discharged, keeping them in service. As a result, the Lithuanian standing army can be increased from 14,000 to 20,000. Including reservists, the total reaches 31,000. Various defensive weapons, such as anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns, will be improved. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>British Newspapers Not Surprised by German Disregard for League of Nations Resolution, Believe International Negotiations Are Still Open</h3>
<p>(London) Since the German government's protest against the League of Nations condemnation resolution was delivered to Britain, there has been no alarm in British public opinion. Most newspapers believe that the wording of the German dispatch is very mild, given the tense situation. The Times stated that Germany feels most dissatisfied with the League of Nations, not with any single country. As for Germany's eventual return to Geneva, it has suffered a significant blow. However, the possibility of collective action still seems to exist. The Daily Telegraph stated that, as things stand, it cannot be said that Germany has cut off the path of negotiations with Western European countries. It has been learned from Moscow that Franco-Russian negotiations have now been declared broken. Germany's attitude may soften somewhat upon hearing this. The Sunday Times stated that Germany's annoyance was expected, and the major powers should have foreseen it. The Observer's reporter Garvin stated that the joint protest issued at the end of the Stresa conference was sufficient in terms of quality and seriousness, and there was no need to take other steps. In the abstract, the Geneva resolution is undoubtedly correct, but in practical politics, it is meaningless. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Dispatch Delivered to Moscow</h3>

<h3>Who is the Culprit of the European War? Former Austro-Hungarian Prime Minister Tries to Exonerate Himself</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Some people accuse former Austro-Hungarian Prime Minister Berchtold of being one of the culprits of the European War. Berchtold recently gave an interview to the "Sunday Monday Newspaper," denying this claim. He said that the reason why Austria-Hungary decided to declare war on Serbia in 1914 was because Germany encouraged it. At that time, German Ambassador to Austria Tschirschky advised Emperor William II not to urge Austria so fervently. William II replied, "Who allowed Tschirschky to take such an attitude? In the future, we can say that Germany did not want war." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Discusses the International Situation: The Far East Incident Caused Countries to Expand Militaries, Britain Will Be Drawn into the Vortex if a Great War Breaks Out, Germany's Return to the League of Nations is an Element of European Peace</h3>
<p>(London) Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson recently gave a speech in Scarborough, stating, "The arms race that countries are now engaged in is largely due to the Far East Incident. There are two centers of global turmoil: one in the Far East and one in Europe. However, peace is a whole and cannot be divided. If we want to divide the responsibility for maintaining peace and not cooperate with each other, the result will only be to invalidate the League of Nations Covenant, and the door to a second European war will be opened. If a second world war breaks out, Britain will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, within the scope of a general security system, the success or failure of resolving the issue of Germany's arms equality is extremely important. We believe that Germany's return to Geneva and its full acceptance of the various obligations in the League of Nations Covenant are indispensable elements for truly resolving international problems, and it is for this reason."

<h3>Italy Encourages Marriage: 2,000 Newlywed Couples, Government Subsidies for Honeymoons</h3>

<h3>Bulgarian New Cabinet's Foreign Policy: Enhance Friendship with Yugoslavia, Decide to Draft a New Constitution</h3>
<p>Sofia: The tense political situation in Bulgaria, with the risk of civil war breaking out at any time, has stabilized since King Boris appointed Touchiev to form a cabinet last Friday. Touchiev served as the ambassador to Serbia during the First Balkan War and as the ambassador to Turkey after the Second Balkan War. Therefore, he is very familiar with the Balkan issue. New Foreign Minister Kosev has also recently served as the ambassador to Yugoslavia. New Prime Minister Touchiev told reporters that all members of the new government are determined to implement the policy of May 19 last year. The new government has the king's trust. The king of Bulgaria's power, which had been greatly reduced by the previous two governments, has now been fully restored. Soldiers occupy only three seats in the new government, and the new Minister of the Army, Ninav, is known for opposing military interference in politics, proving that the military warlords cannot control the political situation. As for foreign policy, there will be no major changes. Touchiev recently stated that he cannot tolerate the arrogance of the Macedonian faction and is determined to enhance friendly relations with Yugoslavia. The new cabinet held its first meeting today, appointing the Prime Minister and Minister of Justice to draft a constitutional reform plan. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: The political turmoil in Bulgaria was resolved successfully a few days ago. People here were very satisfied to hear the news, because both the new Prime Minister Touchiev and Foreign Minister Kosev have served as diplomatic envoys and have been stationed in Yugoslavia for a long time. Their friendship with Yugoslavia is well-known. Touchiev told reporters from the Avala News Agency that the new government's domestic and foreign policies will remain the same, adhering to the spirit of the May 19, 1934 coup. It will maintain good friendship with all neighboring countries, and especially with Yugoslavia, it will be sincere and closely cooperative. This is for "the common welfare of the two countries, as well as for the benefit of peace." Foreign Minister Kosev also issued his first declaration to the Avala News Agency, stating that he will strive to closely cooperate with Yugoslavia. This policy is not only endorsed by the entire government, but also supported by the entire Bulgarian people. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Tragedy in Chicago: Bank Employee Has a Nervous Breakdown and Shoots His Own Children to Death</h3>
<p>Chicago: A tragedy that Ibsen and Werner could not have imagined has occurred here in a middle-class family. A bank employee named Gardner had a nervous breakdown before dawn today, shooting and killing his 20-year-old beautiful daughter Rita and 14-year-old son Donna, and wounding his 17-year-old son Ghana. His wife was fortunate to escape unharmed. After Gardner was taken into custody, he declared, "I want to eradicate the mental illness in my family. I was going to wipe everyone out, then commit suicide." This man is short, looks like a frightened rabbit, and does not resemble a murderer. He said that he and his wife had suffered from tuberculosis and that his head "always felt strange." He heard that his children were also complaining, saying that they felt uneasy in their heads. So they roamed around all night, plotting to solve everything. Before dawn, he finally made up his mind, took out a pistol and began to eliminate the whole family. After several shots, the whole family was shocked and called the police. The tragedy was only half-finished, but it was too inhumane. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Butcher Invents a New Type of Boat: Using a Water Pump to Propel the Hull, the Speed Can Reach 20 Kilometers per Hour</h3>
<p>(Paris) A butcher in Dourdan, named Menard, has invented a new type of boat that has no oars, no sails, and no propulsion engine. The speed can reach 20 kilometers per hour. The method is to install a water pump inside the boat, which is powered by an engine. The pump draws water from the bow of the boat, causing the hull to slide forward, and then discharges water from the stern, agitating the waves to propel the hull forward. The manufacturing method is very ingenious. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<h3>A Perspective on the Italo-Ethiopian Dispute</h3>
<p>— (Rome Correspondence)</p>
<p>From one perspective, Italy's national strength can be said to be thriving, with a tendency to compete with Germany and France. However, its domestic production is very small, especially for the materials necessary for modern industrial countries—coal, iron, oil, etc. Therefore, on the other hand, with the development of its national strength, the number of unemployed people has increased from 200,000 to more than a million, and foreign trade is also in a difficult position. Therefore, Italy must seek a way out, on the one hand, to open up new colonies overseas, and on the other hand, to control the contradictions within the country. Coincidentally, on November 23rd of last year, a military conflict occurred between Italian and Ethiopian border troops near the Ualual and Wardir wells. Since this incident, Italy, on the one hand, has wanted to show the authority of a great power, and on the other hand, it wants to take this opportunity to display its skills, in other words, to stimulate its domestic industry.</p>
<p>For example, in recent years, world trade has declined, and Italian merchant ships sailing in the Atlantic Ocean have also suffered from suspensions. Since the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, those suspended ships have all been mobilized as transport ships for the expeditionary force. All unemployed crew members have been reinstated. Various military supply manufacturing factories, or factories related to military supplies, have suddenly become active and are operating day and night. Automobile factories and aircraft factories are swamped with orders. The Italian government is also preparing for total mobilization. If Abyssinia really wants to resist, Italy really seems to be going all out to fight her. But what about Abyssinia? Although Abyssinia is a small independent African country, its area is only 350,000 square miles, and its population is only over seven million (some estimate it to be ten million). The total length of the national railway is only 487 miles. However, there are as many as two million people who can charge into battle. Although they do not have modern weapons, their national character is extremely brave and unyielding. Moreover, King Haile Selassi, although expressing his willingness to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian conflict peacefully, does not relax his military preparations. When the Italian army mobilized to East Africa, the King of Abyssinia also issued a national mobilization order, and he himself announced that he would be the commander-in-chief, with the crown prince as the military supervisor, using the greatest spirit of sacrifice to maintain his country. Italy cannot help but be somewhat wary of this, so it accepted peace, advocated listening to the arbitration of the League of Nations, and did not immediately declare war.</p>
<p>However, there is another reason for not declaring war immediately, which is the complex relationship between Britain, France, and Italy. Because on December 13, 1906, Britain, France, and Italy reached the following secret understanding on the Abyssinian question: (1) Abyssinia is within the sphere of influence of Britain, France, and Italy; (2) the territorial integrity of Abyssinia; (3) the three countries jointly protect each other's interests and maintain equal opportunities. In 1919, Britain, in order to develop the water conservancy of Lake Tana, recognized Italy's right to build a longitudinal railway from Italian Somaliland to Abyssinia, preferential commercial rights along the railway, and other economic rights. In the Rome Agreement of January 7 this year, France also agreed to transfer two or three thousand shares of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway to Italy. Based on this, it seems that Britain, France, and Italy can understand each other, but what they understand is "equal opportunity," not that any one country can occupy it alone.</p>
<p>Now, Italy's attempt is to conquer Abyssinia by force. If it is to attack by railway, it must have the consent of France, and even the understanding of Britain. Even if it occupies "Addis Ababa" (the capital of Abyssinia), it cannot be considered completely resolved. Moreover, it is not easy for the Italian army, with its modern organization, to engage in purely manual labor and horsepower movements in mountainous terrain, and to engage in scattered field battles with the brave Ethiopian cavalry. Therefore, although Italy uses intimidating methods to make Abyssinia submit, it can also stimulate Italy's own industry. Although the atmosphere of war is strong, it is not necessarily realized.

<h3>Since the Northeast Exchange Began, Inward Remittances from Beyond the Customs Have Gradually Increased. In February and March, Inward Remittances Were Less Than 300,000 Yuan, Mostly from Shandong and Hebei Provinces, Followed by Shanghai and Hankou</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the restoration of Northeast exchange on February 1st of this year, remittances have shown a declining trend. Recently, the Japanese and puppet regimes have implemented regulations restricting Chinese laborers from leaving the customs, which has further affected remittances. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter inquired at the remittance office of the General Bureau of Postal Savings Industry on Fourth Malu. According to Director Fang of the office, inward remittances from beyond the customs in February reached more than 20,000 yuan, and in March, it was more than 200,000 yuan. Among them, remittances to Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, and Anhui provinces were the most, followed by Shanghai and Hankou. Outward remittances from the mainland were more than 10,000 yuan in February and more than 20,000 yuan in March, all remitted to Changchun, Heilongjiang, and other places. However, in total, inward remittances from the Northeast in these two months were less than 300,000 yuan, a decrease of nearly two-thirds compared to the past monthly inward remittances of 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. However, inward remittances in April reached more than 200,000 yuan, indicating an improvement in the situation in fact. The economic relationship between the compatriots in the Northeast under subjugation and the mainland, after years of obstruction, has only begun to show this phenomenon today. However, with Japan's invasion of China still unfinished, the future is still unknown. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Guantai Confluence Construction Process: No More Water Accumulation at the Changyuan City Walls</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Since the Central Government ordered the Shanxi-Henan Disaster Relief Committee's Works and Relief Group to take charge of the Guantai Yellow River confluence project, the group has actively proceeded. On the 11th of this month, the 29-meter-deep breach was successfully closed, and the news was celebrated throughout the country. Various details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. The Water Conservancy Committee of the Economic Council, based on a report submitted by Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Works and Relief Group, regarding the Guantai confluence construction process, has made valuable research on river works. The details are specially explored as follows: (Above omitted) According to the report submitted by the Engineering Section of the group, the Guantai breach is located at the bend of the Yellow River channel, where the river divides into two branches: one is a diversion at the bend, and the other is a backflow due to the obstruction angle downstream. The backflow is more violent, so the eastern headland is constantly scoured. Since March 21st, efforts have been made to protect it, but the costs have been high. On the evening of the 26th, the peach blossom flood came down, and the flow was as fierce as rushing cattle, constantly surging. Fortunately, the situation was stabilized after all-night rescue efforts and thorough preparations. However, the river's branched entrance remained the same. With such a large flow in front of us, and the depth of the breach being about 29 meters, it was difficult to start closing the breach. It was not possible to succeed without quickly guiding the river flow into the middle channel and reducing the flow's scouring force. Therefore, on the 27th, we began to build two permeable willow dams upstream. The first dam was 175 meters long, and the second dam was 207 meters long. By April 5th, they were completed one after another. However, the willow dams were permeable in nature, and their ends were difficult to intersect smoothly with the upstream protruding angle, so although the flow was slightly dispersed, it was still close at the beginning and farther apart later. The harm of the backflow could not be completely eliminated. The breach closing project was implemented on the 6th, but the effect was minimal. Therefore, on the 7th, we arranged civilian ships and densely dropped anchored ropes to form a floating dam, which formed a T-shaped right angle with the middle channel, starting from the corner of the western dam and ending at the edge of the middle channel. At that time, the middle flow was finally brought under control and flowed straight down, and its function was the same as that of the permeable willow dam. From then on, the branched flows were gradually cut off, and the breach closing project was intensified and progressed vigorously. Layer by layer, willow skin and stone pillows, about half a meter in diameter and 13 meters long, were sunk. On the 7th, the breach was raised by more than four meters. On the 8th and 9th, a total of 529 bundles of pillows were sunk, raising it more than five meters above the original branch riverbed. As a result, the water势 in the breach was almost like water flowing from a ditch, only overflowing from the gaps. On the 10th, the water depth of the breach was measured to be only three meters. Therefore, we worked hard to consolidate it and filled the gaps with pillows. By the morning of the 11th, only a breach of about one meter wide and one meter deep remained. With the supervision of the staff, it was blocked and closed in two hours. Willow stones were laid on top of each other, about two meters above the water surface. Then, burlap material and earth bags were used to cover the surface, so that it was as high as the two dams. In the future, earth bags and stones will be added to the outside to thicken the embankment, cultivate the slope, build protective embankments, and then backfill and solidify the soil, so that it can be permanently protected from the turbulent waves and not be affected by the伏汛. Someone said that the speed of this breach closure was mainly due to the function of the permeable willow dam in releasing silt. This argument does not seem to be consistent with the facts and science. The function of the permeable dam is not comparable to the solid force of a stone dam in diverting the flow. Its function can only disperse the flow in the immediate vicinity, and it will converge again at a distance. Moreover, it is difficult to control the flow into the middle channel with its location and strength. If the flow is rapid, the dam body may be difficult to protect, and if the flow is slow, the amount of silt deposited is very small. Therefore, the third floating ship was used as a dam to complete its width. It has been said before that the three dams are only for dispersing the flow and buffering it. If you want to make it actually release silt, it is impossible. The current Yellow River has a velocity of two meters per second, and the sand content is only about two percent, so it is extremely difficult to quickly achieve the effect of releasing silt. It was also found that there was a sloping depression in front of the breach after the confluence, more than ten meters deep, the same as before. The height of this depression is no longer affected by the height of the dam. How can we abandon the near and seek the far, and fill the dam over the depression? The facts are all there and can be pursued, and the principle is as clear as looking in a mirror. In short, the speed of this breach closure was truly due to the rapid preparation experience, transportation, and effective management, as well as the agility of the construction. (Below omitted) After the Guantai confluence, the group sent personnel to the various breaches in the Shiche section, as well as the Taihang Dike and around Changyuan County, to investigate the water level situation. According to the report, the water level in front of Hekou Village on the Taihang Dike has dropped by nine meters since the Guantai confluence. Before the confluence of the Eighth Breach, the original water surface width of the mouth was 164 meters, and now it is 101 meters. The deepest part before was 6.7 meters, and the current depth is 5.8 meters. In the past three days, the water level has dropped by nine meters, and the shallowest part of the mouth is now 2.5 meters. The water surface of the river in front of the Eighth Mouth above the river is now 110 meters wide, and the water depth is 6.5 meters. The water surface behind the river is 17 meters wide and 7 inches deep. It was also found that the original water surface width of the Seventeenth Breach was 178 meters, and now it is 121 meters. The deepest part before was 5.1 meters, and the current depth is 4.2 meters. In the past three days, the water has moved nine inches to the east, and the shallowest part is now 1.2 meters. The water surface of the river in front of the Seventeenth Mouth above the river is 38 meters wide, and the water depth is 4.8 meters. The current water surface behind the river is 26 meters wide and 1.5 meters deep. It was also found that the original depth of the Twenty-First Breach was 9.8 meters, and the current depth is 9 meters. The water surface of the river in front of the mouth above the river is 33 meters wide, and the water depth is 2.8 meters. The surface behind the river is 24 meters wide and 6 inches deep. The water in front of and behind the Twenty-Fifth Breach has receded completely. We also contacted Zhang, the County Magistrate of Changyuan County, and Yang Runzhi, the Vice-Chairman of the City Defense Committee, and reported that this group was ordered to take charge of the Guantai breach repair project, dispatching and transporting, concentrating materials, allocating work, and rushing forward day and night. We took over the job just two weeks ago and were able to announce the confluence. All of this was achieved by following the central government's spirit and comforting the people's long-awaited hopes. According to Vice-Chairman Yang Runzhi, the Director is concerned about the people's suffering and cherishes their difficulties. For the more than 300,000 disaster victims in Changyuan, his kindness is like a second birth. All those who have been rescued are due to the Director's contribution. We admire the Director's arduous efforts and see him as a living Buddha for ten thousand families. We all offer incense and pray for his longevity. His words are sincere and his feelings are pitiful. According to County Magistrate Zhang, the water near the city has dropped by about seven inches in the past three days, and 81 villages that were previously submerged have been evacuated. We then accompanied the County Magistrate, the Vice-Chairman of the City Defense Committee, and representatives from all walks of life to inspect the city walls for a week. There is no longer any accumulated water at the base of the city walls. The drainage ditches and moats in the northwest corner are still flowing. All of this is the situation on the 13th. Now that there is no source of water, it will inevitably dry up day by day. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Public Trial of the Quan-Liu Tragic Death Case</h3>
<p>The case of Quan Lianfu, a resident of XichiJia Street in Cangqiao, falsely accusing his daughter-in-law Liu of infidelity and instigating his son Quan Wangcai to return home and beat his wife Liu, resulting in serious injuries and death, has been widely rumored. Some rumors say that the father and son beat her to death, while others say that she was beaten and took poison to die. Later, Liu Meichu, the deceased's elder brother, filed a complaint. The procuratorate conducted an investigation and found that the deceased's chest and back were covered with scars, now the color of pig liver, and there were traces of holes from stabbing with a poker, indicating a tragic death. Quan Lianfu and his son Wangcai were prosecuted for homicide, assault, and instigation after interrogation. Quan Wangcai suddenly claimed that his wife had an affair with Zhou Songsheng and was beaten by Zhou's wife when they met on the road. She was ashamed and committed suicide. Zhou was then summoned for interrogation and absolutely denied the allegations, claiming that his wife had died many years ago and insisted that he was being framed. Recently, seven neighbors jointly submitted a petition to the court, requesting lenient punishment, but the petition mentioned that Quan Liu was beaten by Zhou Songsheng's other mistress and committed suicide. Today, Ma Qianru, Yang Xiqing, Zhou Jinchang, and others who signed the joint petition were summoned for questioning. They were asked what evidence they had for the statements in the petition. They all said that the petition was drafted and sent to them by Quan Wangcai's younger brother, Shousheng, for them to stamp, and they did not know the contents. The interrogator then questioned Quan Lianfu about who drafted the petition. Quan Lianfu made all kinds of excuses. After the interrogation, Quan Wangcai was ordered to be returned to custody, awaiting the appointment of a defense lawyer and a scheduled hearing. Quan Lianfu was still handed over to the original guarantor.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Embezzlement of River Works Funds</h3>
<p>In Litahui Township, funds were being collected to hire workers for dredging the Duanshan River. The township head, Hu Chengren, along with the heads of the neighboring Jinshan Mao Liu townships, Huang Jutu, had begun the project. However, Yu Yayun, the fourth Ba trưởng (ward head) of Mao Liu Township, suddenly led villagers to obstruct the work. The garrisoned water patrol suppressed the unrest, arrested Yu, and sent him to the county government for investigation. It has now come to light that several villagers secretly sabotaged numerous large and small dams and destroyed the office, causing river water to flood in and making dredging impossible. Yesterday, Director Hu filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office, requesting their detention and investigation. The county prosecutor's office, considering [section illegible] instructed [section illegible] in Jinshan County.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Completion of Party Affairs Reorganization in Wuxian</h3>

<h3>Nanhui: Conditions of the Second Joint Baojia System</h3>
<p>The third phase of Baojia work in the second district of this county has been completed. The other day, provincial instructor Gu Suiming came to the district to conduct spot checks on the Baojia. The district's compilation and investigation committee member Chuan Si accompanied him, and the inspection lasted three days. The townships and towns inspected included Binhai, Tengjia, Yumin, Chuandong, and Gaoqiao. During the inspection, Mr. Gu investigated the accuracy of household registration forms, the understanding of the joint liability agreements by each household head, and paid close attention to the ideology, character, and understanding of the meaning of Baojia by the township and town Baojia heads. He also examined their sense of responsibility and ability to handle affairs. The inspection revealed that the compilation and investigation work in the district was quite thorough. The Baojia regulations were drafted separately by each Bao trưởng after gathering the 甲 trưởng. Therefore, Instructor Gu praised the Baojia work in the district.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Two Men Commit Suicide in Succession</h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of suicide has become unstoppable. Statistics show that in the past two months, there have been forty to fifty suicides, both male and female. Unexpectedly, yesterday, two more men committed suicide one after the other. One was Ji Amei, a villager from Huangjia Village near Qingyang Town in Jiangyin, aged thirty. He used to work as a laborer in the Lixin Cloth Factory in this county. However, Huang spent money recklessly, resulting in severe financial difficulties. Recently, he accumulated a large debt that he could not repay. With the idea of suicide in mind, he swallowed two jiao worth of raw opium in the morning. He was discovered by his neighbor and sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was not deep, and his life was out of danger. The second was Xu Aquan, a villager from Xi Dafangqiao Village in Anzhen, Eighth District, aged thirty-six. He also had a quarrel with his wife over trivial matters, which was resolved after some persuasion. Aquan left in anger and went to a hotel in the town to drink heavily. After getting drunk, he returned home, grabbed a kitchen knife, and attempted to cut his throat. His wife saw this and rushed him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he did not injure his carotid artery or trachea, and his life may be saved.</p>
<h3>County Order Sets Deadline for Completion of Baojia</h3>
<p>Our county is implementing the Baojia system, and each district is carrying out the third phase of work, which is nearing completion. Most recently, the county government received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering them to report the progress of the compilation and investigation of Baojia work as soon as possible and to set a deadline for completion. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan convened the 59th district chiefs' meeting yesterday morning and resolved that the third phase of Baojia work in the townships and districts must be completed by May 5th, and in the urban areas by May 20th, without delay. After the meeting, the First District Office also convened a district affairs meeting and resolved: (1) to expedite the drafting of Baojia regulations and joint liability agreements, and to complete them within this month; (2) to comply with the county magistrate's order to register ships and issue licenses.</p>

<p>The renowned doctor Zhou Mengdan, who lives on Ximen Avenue, is from a family of doctors. His father, Zhou Qitang, was also famous for a time. Mengdan is currently sixty-one years old and has considerable experience in treating external diseases. However, due to years of economic pressure, he has lost over ten thousand yuan. He does not pay much attention to medical affairs and spends his days playing mahjong and drinking yellow wine. On the 21st of this month, he suffered a significant shock and secretly took multiple sleeping pills. He became poisoned in the evening, and doctors on Zhongxi Road were called to perform surgery, but it was ineffective. He died immediately.</p>
<h3>Another Famine Fight Erupts in the Sixth District</h3>
<p>In the cotton-growing area of the sixth district of this county, which suffered from a severe drought last year, famine riots have repeatedly occurred since winter. Now is the time between the end of one harvest and the beginning of the next, and the starving people in the countryside have nothing to eat but wheat stalks and sweet potatoes. The Disaster Relief Association is about to distribute spring relief, but due to insufficient funds, it has not yet been implemented. However, on the afternoon of the 21st of this month, about one hundred and several tens of old women from the Shuzhou City area gathered at the Lao Wushi District Office, demanding relief from the district chief. The situation was very serious, and many people mistakenly believed that the relief funds had been allocated to the district but were diverted by District Chief Yang for dredging rivers, causing a great uproar that could not be quelled. The local Second District Party Headquarters, together with the district chief, offered earnest persuasion, and they finally dispersed. They have also telegraphed the county government, requesting that relief be released as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Change of Head of Field Tax</h3>

His wife, Cai, is thirty-seven years old and has five children. The eldest daughter is eighteen years old, and the second daughter is fourteen. In recent years, Cai has been having an affair with a neighbor named Zhang Jinguan, which has caused frequent disputes between the couple. The other day, Chunfu and Cai had another conflict, and Cai used a knife to slash at Chunfu. Chunfu reached out and grabbed the knife, injuring his fingers. He then seized the knife and slashed at Cai, injuring her face. She fell to the ground, and he severed her throat, causing her death. Seeing that his wife was dead, Chunfu confessed to the township head, Wang Xiangyuan, who reported the matter to the Fourth Public Security Bureau. The bureau arrested Chunfu, transferred him to the local court for interrogation and imprisonment, and went to examine the body on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Department Asks for Testing of Man-Made Gasoline</h3>

After testing by aircraft at the Aviation School, the results were very good. However, it is necessary to study its chemical composition, its impact on automobile parts, its capability compared to gasoline, and whether it is suitable for use as automobile fuel. In order to promote it, one gallon was requested from Mr. Xu and sent to Jiaotong University in Shanghai for chemical testing, and a detailed report of the results will be provided.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Yang Wang Commits Suicide Due to Starvation</h3>
<p>Yang Kechang, a farmer from Juxing Town Nanli Xu, Fifth District, is in a poor financial situation. Last year, due to a long drought, the cotton and grain harvest was poor, making a living even more difficult. At this time between harvests, the family lacked food and had nothing to cook. The other day (the 20th), Yang's wife, Wang, went to a neighbor's house to borrow rice and wheat but was unsuccessful. Feeling very resentful, she had thoughts of ending her life. That night, she used a razor to slit her throat in the room. By the time Yang realized and tried to save her, her throat had been cut and she had lost too much blood, so the effort was in vain. She died shortly after. Yesterday (the 21st), Yang reported the matter to the county government. After Chen Cheng, the presiding judge, went to investigate, he confirmed that she had committed suicide and ordered the family to collect the body for burial.</p>

At 3:00 in the afternoon, they visited the Art Exhibition, and at 11:00 in the evening, they took a special train to Beijing to pay respects to the Chinese authorities. In order to expedite the inspection, the previously determined itinerary was changed. A reporter from the Central News Agency has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Paying Respects to the Mayor: At 10:00 yesterday morning, all the members gathered in the reception room on the third floor of the International Hotel. At 10:30, they boarded eight pre-arranged, state-of-the-art cars and set off, accompanied by Guo Bingwen, Zhang Xianglin, Yang Guangxing, Chen Bingzhang, Xia Xiaofang, Wang Erxun, Lu Shou Lian, Wei Xianzhang, and others, along Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, and Jungong Road to the city center to pay respects to Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Mayor Welcomes: City government officials invited them to the reception room on the third floor, where Mayor Wu, accompanied by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, received them. City government secretaries Tang Shixuan and Zhang Tingrong provided refreshments. Mayor Wu expressed his warmest welcome to the mission's leader, Forbes, and wished them a pleasant journey. He also said that the various constructions in the city center, such as the Qiujiang Wharf and the city center railway, would bring Sino-American trade closer together in the future after the success of land-sea transportation.</p>
<p>Praising Construction: They then accompanied the mission to visit the mayor's office, the library, the auditorium, and the model room of the city center's construction, where detailed explanations were given for each room. The mission members expressed great pleasure at the vigorous progress of Shanghai's construction. Finally, they took a group photo on the steps in front of the city government auditorium, shook hands, and parted. The mission members then boarded cars and visited the Zhabei war zone along Jiangwan Road and Baoshan Road, then entered Henan Road and turned into Jiangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, and the American Club to attend a banquet hosted by the Sino-American Trade Association.</p>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon's Reception: The Sino-American Trade Association's banquet was aimed at gathering and connecting with the mission. During the banquet, the association's Fulan District delivered a welcoming speech, and mission leader Forbes thanked them for their hospitality and guidance. Guo Bingwen, Pan Guangjiong, and the president of the American Chamber of Commerce then made brief speeches. At the same time, the Shanghai American Women's Association hosted a luncheon for the wives of the American Economic Mission members at its clubhouse on Jing'an Temple Road. Those present included Mrs. Dillingham, Mrs. Storitor, Mrs. Wickham, and Mrs. Hutchins. After the meal, a ten-minute short play was performed, with Mrs. Hoer, Mrs. Scott, Mrs. Gregg, Mrs. Janes, and Mrs. Cannegie participating. The hosts and guests had a very pleasant time.</p>
<p>En Route to Beijing Last Night: All the members of the mission and their families went to the Bund one after another at 3:00 in the afternoon to visit the Shanghai preview of the London Chinese Art Exhibition. They were accompanied by Zhang Xianglin and Xia Xiaofang from the reception office, as well as staff from the Art Exhibition, who provided explanations. The mission members expressed great interest and admiration for these ancient artifacts of Eastern culture. They returned to their residences at 5:00. The mission then took a night train to Beijing at 11:00 last night. Pan Guangjiong and Zhang Xianglin went to see them off. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus specially provided a decorated car and sent staff to provide assistance to show their hospitality. Hou Aichang, representing the entire association, and Tang Dehua, representing the Ministry of Railways, accompanied them. Wang Zhisheng from the reception office also went along to take care of them. The entire group is scheduled to return to Shanghai by China Aviation Corporation Douglas aircraft at 4:00 p.m. on the 25th.</p>
<p>Various Public Banquets: Mayor Wu will host a banquet at the municipal government in the city center at 7:00 p.m. on the 25th, and invitations have already been sent out. At 7:00 p.m. on the 26th, sixteen local organizations will host a public banquet at the International YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. The reception office has issued over two hundred invitations, including prominent figures in politics, local dignitaries, leaders in industry and commerce, representatives of various organizations, prominent Americans in Shanghai, and the Chinese and Western press. It will be a grand banquet, rarely seen in Shanghai, entirely contracted by Xinghualou, with Chinese cuisine served in a Western style. Western guests will wear formal attire on that day, and Chinese hosts and guests should wear mandarin gowns if they are wearing Chinese dress, and be seated at 7:00 p.m. sharp.</p>
<p>Wuhan Welcomes: In order to facilitate the mission's inspection, the reception office telegraphed various places the mission wished to visit to arrange receptions. They have now received a reply from the Wuhan Municipal Government welcoming them. The telegram reads as follows: To the reception office of the American Economic Mission at the International Hotel: We have received all three letters and are discussing reception preparations with relevant agencies, including the Chamber of Commerce and banks. Please telegraph the exact number of mission members, the confirmed dates, and the number of days they will be inspecting in Wuhan, and please send staff to Wuhan in advance to make arrangements. Wuhan Municipal Government, Yang.</p>
<p>Letter of Thanks to the Mayor: The mission felt deeply grateful for the hospitality extended to them during their two days in Shanghai and was particularly pleased with what they had seen and heard. They sent a letter to the mayor and various sectors as follows: We are very grateful for the hospitality we have received in Shanghai and are confident that this trip will yield tangible results, and that the inspection plan is well-suited to our use of our time. Tonight, we are taking a train to Nanjing to meet with Chinese government officials, and we look forward to their advice and guidance in making the most of our time in China. This Thursday, we will fly back to Shanghai and attend the Shanghai Mayor's dinner. Next week, we will divide into two teams and fly to Guangzhou. While our itinerary beyond that is still uncertain, we will, if possible, visit the commercial center of North China for inspection and return to Shanghai via central China. We plan to make a longer stay in Shanghai at the end of the tour. This morning, our mission visited the city center and paid a visit to the Mayor of Shanghai. We were deeply impressed by the beauty of the new City Hall and the Great Shanghai City Center project, which is under construction. If the plan can be realized, we believe it will be the most valuable urban center in the world's major cities. The members of our mission take this opportunity to congratulate the Mayor and the people of this city on the completion of the Great Shanghai project.</p>

<h3>Hua Xigui, Qualified Chinese Pilot from the Far East Aviation School</h3>
<p>Hua Xigui (transliteration), a former student of the Hong Kong Far East Aviation Training School, recently passed the Hong Kong government technical examination and obtained a Class C basic pilot's certificate. He is the first Chinese person in Hong Kong's aviation history to obtain this qualification. Mr. Hua enrolled in the school as a mechanic student in 1934. Normally, those who apply for the basic technician examination must prove to the government's aviation affairs officer that they have at least two years of experience in the care of aircraft or aircraft engines, or that they have received two years of training at a government-recognized aviation school, before they are qualified to take the examination. However, because Mr. Hua had previously studied in the mechanics department for five years, this qualification was reduced to one year. China's aviation industry urgently needs trained basic pilots. The efficiency of a country's aviation affairs depends on experts taking care of and maintaining the necessary aviation equipment. The construction of modern aircraft is very complex and requires pilots with in-depth technical expertise to take care of it. The field of aviation mechanics is vast and still awaits scholars to study and develop it. Therefore, the future of trained aircraft mechanics is truly limitless. Currently, there are forty-four people receiving long-term training in the mechanics department at the Far East Aviation School. Their training regulations are the same as those set by the British Aviation Department, and they are committed to creating practical talents. It is hoped that Mr. Hua will be the first of many qualified mechanics to graduate from the Far East Aviation School. Mr. Hua has now been given an aviation position.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China yesterday telegraphed chambers of commerce across the country, saying: To all city chambers of commerce across the country, We hereby notify you that the Legislative Yuan's Civil Law Committee has sent a letter, stating: In order to comply with the Yuan's order, the bankruptcy law has been drafted, and a preliminary draft has now been completed. It has been decided to publicly solicit opinions in order to consider amendments before submitting it to the Yuan for discussion, so as to achieve perfection. We hope that your chamber of commerce will express your opinions and send them to this association by May 10 of this year. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee and Economic Committee jointly sent a letter, stating: The committee is now examining the draft outline of the Inspection of Goods for Domestic Sale, which was submitted by the Yuan for discussion. Regarding the implementation of inspection of goods for domestic sale, the types of goods that should be inspected, the inspection locations, and the collection of inspection fees, etc., please provide detailed information if you have any comments for reference. As each approval is in place, we find the two drafts to be very important. In addition to studying them at this association, we are sending you a copy of the main points of the draft outline of the Inspection of Goods for Domestic Sale. We hope that you will conduct a thorough study of the two drafts and express your opinions directly to the committees of the Legislative Yuan to achieve perfection. Please request the draft bankruptcy law from the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Attachment: Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully announces, "Attached are the main points of the draft outline of the Inspection of Goods for Domestic Sale:" (1) Situations of various items in Article 1 of the Law on Inspection of Goods for Domestic Sale, which should be implemented again in the inspection of domestic sales to promote their improvement.

<h3>Banks Release 5 Million Consecutively for Three Days, Solution for a Smooth Passage Through the End of April</h3>
<p>Jia Shi News Agency reports that in order to regulate the market, major banks such as China Merchants Bank and Bank of Communications have been actively engaged in interbank collateral loans since the 22nd. As of yesterday, the amount has reached more than 5 million yuan. On the 22nd, the three banks, China Merchants Bank, Bank of Communications, and others, jointly released more than 4 million yuan, of which the Bank of China released the most directly, reaching more than 3 million yuan. Yesterday (23rd), many money shops continued to request loans. In the morning, the three banks still released loans through the Bank of China, about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. In the afternoon, tens of thousands of yuan were released successively. Therefore, the total amount released in the past two days has exceeded 5 million yuan. The loan method is the same as before, with the three banks announcing the daily interest rate every day. The daily interest rate for the past two days has been 2 jiao. In addition, the real estate deeds used by the money shops when requesting loans may be approved on a case-by-case basis after obtaining certification from the guild if the transfer cannot be completed temporarily. After the implementation of the large-scale loans by the three banks, the general situation has become stable, and it is expected that the number of people requesting loans today will decrease.</p>
<p>Interest on Renewed Loans at the End of April Appropriately Reduced</p>
<p>Regarding the long-term loans issued by various money shops, which will expire at the end of April, amounting to about 40 million yuan, due to the poor business conditions this year, most stores have difficulty clearing inventory, and it is quite difficult to repay the long-term loans, requesting permission to renew them. It is now learned that the money industry, as the banks have agreed to provide current loan to the money industry and maintain the market, the renewal of these loan can be approved, except for a small number of less creditworthy, but the money industry will moderately raise the interest rate by 1 to 1.5 li to compensate. The interest rates for merchants with excellent credit will remain the same.</p>
<p>Continued Increase in Silver Deposits Survey</p>
<p>According to the Central Bank's announcement, the total silver deposits in the city's Chinese and foreign banks last week were 338,626,000 yuan, an increase of 1,471,000 yuan compared to the previous week's 337,155,000 yuan. Of this, Chinese banks accounted for 288,270,000 yuan, and foreign banks accounted for 50,356,000 yuan. Chinese banks continued to increase compared to the previous week, while foreign banks decreased by another 8,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests the Public Works Department to Stop Telephone Rate Hikes and Cancel Tolls for Calls Between Chinese Concessions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, having received a joint request from various trade associations in the city, such as the restaurant industry, urging negotiations with the Public Works Department to promptly rescind the proposed rate increase by the telephone company to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, specially submitted a report to the municipal government yesterday. Copies were also sent to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement and the Board of Directors of the French Concession for their information. The original text is as follows: "Report for Requesting Matters: On the 23rd of this month, we received a joint letter from the following trade associations in the city: restaurant industry, cotton cloth industry, machine embroidery and dyeing industry, cotton trading houses, local goods industry, iron printing and can manufacturing industry, biscuit, candy, and canned goods industry, silk and satin printing industry, thermos manufacturing industry, Chinese and Western furniture stores, hardware industry, yellow sand and crushed stone industry, forwarding industry, coal industry, sandalwood and longan trading houses, postal transport industry, bamboo industry, cotton ginning industry, cattle and sheep industry, machine-made noodle industry, umbrella industry, egg industry, cold air and ice industry, chemical fertilizer sales industry, enamel industry, glass industry, woolens industry, eyeglasses industry, paint industry, bookstores, electrical silk weaving factories, sausage industry, domestic rubber products industry, refining industry, knitting industry, electrical appliance industry, freight trucking industry, pawnshop industry, etc., stating that 'The telephone bureau is a public utility and should consider the interests of the society and the public, thereby promoting local economic development and expanding its own business. Both parties are closely related and should maintain each other to achieve common prosperity. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company only knows how to seek private gain. Amidst the turbulent economic downturn in the city, it suddenly proposed a telephone rate increase, causing panic and outcry among various industries, yet to this day, the company authorities have not shown any sign of remorse or rescinded the proposal. Merchants from various industries, after much reflection, believe that in addition to the rate increase issue, which should be fought to the death with the support of your esteemed association, there is also the issue of tolls for calls between the Chinese concessions, which has been unresolved for many years. The company's exploitation is increasing day by day, and the suffering of the merchants and the people is deepening. We will further explain this situation to the gentlemen of your esteemed association. The Shanghai Chinese and International Settlements are adjacent to each other, and their business relationships are inseparable. Calls between them should not be subject to additional fees, which would burden the entire commercial sector. Previously, various industries jointly opposed this in newspapers, but the Shanghai Telephone Company has firmly insisted on charging tolls for calls, citing the temporary telephone contract, which stipulates a fee of five cents per call, as an excuse. However, the telephone contract's provision was solely a unilateral claim by the company, and the Chinese authorities repeatedly negotiated for its cancellation without success. To this day, calls between the Chinese concessions not only incur substantial costs but also require manual switching, which is slow, laborious, and costly, severely impacting the future of commerce. Even more appalling is that the company's billing for calls between the Chinese concessions for various businesses is entirely fictitious, without any factual basis. It either reports no calls as calls or underreports calls as more calls, arbitrarily listing them to satisfy its private desires. If questioned, it responds rudely, making it unapproachable. Merchants and people's hard-earned money is not easy to come by. At a time of financial hardship and public distress, how can they bear the additional burden on top of the fixed rental fees to satisfy the company's insatiable demands? Therefore, we are stating the situation. As the dispute over the rate increase remains unresolved, we request that your esteemed association consider the suffering of the people and submit the issue of tolls for calls between the Chinese concessions and the recent telephone rate increase to the Shanghai Municipal Government for resolution. Simultaneously, please have the Public Works Department of the International Settlement forward a message to the Shanghai Telephone Company, urging it to promptly rescind the said toll collection method and the proposed telephone rate increase to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. If the company disregards public opinion and insists on having its way, we implore your esteemed association to identify the objective, persevere to the end, and engage in a long-term struggle with unwavering spirit. In the future, if the situation demands it, we will not hesitate to make sacrifices. We hope that the gentlemen of your esteemed association will vigorously preside over this matter to comfort the long-awaited wishes of the merchants and the people. This will not only be the good fortune of the same industry but also the blessing of the entire citizenry.' After this matter was brought to the association, we, after observing the current social situation, believe that the company's profits last year exceeded six percent, which is unmatched by any other business in these depressed times. It should not extract public funds to enrich itself further. We have twice sent letters to the Public Works Department expressing this view and urging it to prevent the company from raising prices. Furthermore, Chairman Yu of our association attended a meeting of the Public Works Department's Public Utilities Committee and expressed our opposition to the rate increase and strongly condemned the collection of fees per call. In all these situations, we have stated that our association represents the interests of all the merchants in the city. The proposed rate increase by the company must be abandoned. The merchants and the people of the city will not be able to rest easy until this is done. As for the toll of five cents for each call to the Chinese concessions, the measure is particularly inappropriate. The telephone company of the International Settlement and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau have their lines within the same city area and have both adopted automatic switching equipment. Calls between them can be made directly by dialing. Why must there be manual switching, which only burdens citizens with an additional five cents per call? This is truly unreasonable and should be abolished altogether. Based on the aforementioned letter, we hereby submit this document to your esteemed government for review and approval. Please order the Public Utilities Bureau to promptly negotiate with the authorities of the International Settlement to prevent this from happening. This would be in the best interests of the public." (The letters to the Public Works Department, etc., are the same, so they are omitted.)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Siam Hope to Sign a Sino-Siamese Commercial Treaty; Representatives Returning to China to Petition Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the previous decree issued by the Siamese government to suppress Chinese education, which has recently intensified, with the re-issuance of harsh laws restricting the residence and business of overseas Chinese, the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter has obtained the following information from the Shanghai Chinese United Association:</p>
<p>Newly Revised Harsh Regulations</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the association, the Chinese Education Regulations enacted by the Siamese government last year were revised once this year and will soon be formally implemented. The content of these regulations almost turns the overseas Chinese in Siam into illiterates. It stipulates that Chinese schools are only allowed to teach Chinese for three hours per week, averaging less than one lesson per day. All textbooks must be in Siamese. What is even harsher is that the Ministry of Education has specially assigned someone to each Chinese school to supervise it, almost completely controlling all school affairs, leaving the principal with only an empty title.</p>
<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>Subsequently, any Chinese schools that do not comply will be sealed up. So far, four schools, including Chongshi, Sanmin, Yihua, and Yixin, have been closed in Bangkok. As a result, the relationship between the Siamese and the Chinese is deteriorating day by day. Therefore, after receiving the report, this association has already appealed to the government, requesting prompt negotiations to stop this. The overseas Chinese in Siam have also sent three representatives back to China, who are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. At that time, this association will also send representatives to Beijing to jointly file an effective petition.</p>
<p>A Treaty Should Be Signed Quickly</p>
<p>Our country and Siam are countries without a treaty, and there has been no commercial treaty signed to date, nor have ambassadors been exchanged. How can our more than two million overseas Chinese in Siam, living under the rule of others, not suffer? Therefore, in addition to passively demanding that our government promptly negotiate to stop these unequal measures against foreigners by the Siamese government, we also actively hope that the government can quickly sign a commercial treaty with the Siamese government so that both can abide by it. It is rumored that Siam's actions are being instigated by a certain country.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Representative Chu Huiseng Visited Song Yesterday to Request That the Bank of China Initiate the Formation of a Syndicate to Lend Money to Silk Factories for the Purchase of New Cocoons</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association Federation recently held a meeting in Shanghai and resolved to request the Bank of China to initiate the formation of a cocoon lending syndicate to lend money to various factories specifically for the purchase of cocoons. The chairman of the association, Chu Huiseng, went to the Bank of China yesterday morning at 10:30 to meet with the chairman of the bank, Song Ziwen, to present the details. Song entrusted Xu Guangchi, the section chief of the bank's Second Business Department, to meet with him. After Chu stated his intention, he explained in detail the plight of the silk manufacturers and the urgent need to form a cocoon lending syndicate. After an hour of discussion, Xu agreed to convey the association's views to Chairman Song. Chu then took his leave.</p>
<h3>Polish Goods Exhibition Postponed to Today Due to Ship's Delayed Arrival Due to Fog</h3>
<p>The Polish Ministry of Trade specially dispatched the ship "Dar Pomorza" in January, fully loaded with approximately 10,000 tons of various Polish products. Departing from Gdynia, it passed through the South Sea Islands and Singapore before heading directly to Hong Kong. Along the way, it stopped at various important ports for several days, inviting local people from all walks of life to board the ship for tours and exhibitions. After the exhibition in Hong Kong, it sailed to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive yesterday morning, and the opening ceremony of the Polish Goods Exhibition was to be held on the ship starting yesterday, with a public exhibition for three days. On the 27th, it will sail to Dalian, then to Kobe and Yokohama for exhibitions, before returning to Shanghai to move the samples to the Polish Chamber of Commerce in China for permanent display. However, due to heavy fog at sea in recent days, the ship did not arrive in Shanghai until 5 PM yesterday and was moored at the New Jardine Matheson Wharf in Pudong. Therefore, it has been postponed by one day and will open for public exhibition starting today and until the 27th. On the 28th, it will sail to Dalian. Those who wish to visit can go to the New Customs Wharf and take a free ferry, which departs every half hour. A tea party will also be held on the ship at 4 PM today to welcome business and Chinese and Western press representatives for a visit.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Realizes Automatic Rent Reduction; Monthly Rent Payers to Enjoy This Benefit</h3>
<p>In view of the extreme economic downturn, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has automatically implemented rent reductions for properties on Avenue Joffre, Avenue Albert, Yu Yuen Road, Route Doumer, Route Cardinal Mercier, and Seymour Road starting this month. However, it is heard that only those who pay their rent monthly will enjoy this rent reduction benefit. Those who are in arrears will still be charged the original rent. Once they pay off their arrears, they will still be able to enjoy this right. It is said that other real estate operators in Shanghai may follow suit with automatic rent reductions to reduce the burden on residents.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Purchase All Vessels of the Chekiang River Company; Nine Riverboats for a Price of 1.2 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company only had one riverboat, the "Emei," for its Sichuan River route. Since the ship was wrecked two years ago, the company's Sichuan River liner service has been suspended for more than a year and a half. Currently, the "Emei" requires a long time and more than 100,000 yuan to repair, making resumption of service uncertain. However, in terms of business, it cannot remain closed for long and abandon the route. The company has held many meetings on this matter and decided to seek additional ships other than the "Emei" to resume service and restore the Yangtze River's upper reaches navigation in the short term.</p>
<p>Chekiang River Company Vessels for Sale</p>
<p>The American-owned Chekiang River Steamship Company originally joined American capital to build new ships and expand its operations. Its routes specialized in the Sichuan River section of the upper Yangtze River. Initially, it only had the Yichang-Chongqing route, but later it added riverboats and extended its routes. The direct Chongqing-Shanghai ships were first created by this company. Since the dissolution of the Seven Company Alliance last year, river freight rates have plummeted, and business has declined. In addition, the Minsheng Company has obtained exclusive rights to the Sichuan River navigation business, making it even more difficult for the Chekiang River Company to maintain its position. Its crew members are all foreigners, and various expenses are much higher than those of other ships. The China Navigation Cooperation Society will soon be established, making it difficult for foreign commercial ships to survive in China. The company's shareholders have agreed to sell all the ships and transfer the business to Chinese management. Upon hearing this, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company contacted the company to discuss the purchase.</p>
<p>Agreed Total Ship Price</p>
<p>The Chekiang River Company's influence on the upper Yangtze River is second only to Minsheng. Its routes include the Shanghai-Yichang, Shanghai-Chongqing, and Yichang-Chongqing routes. It has a total of nine large Sichuan River boats and shallow-draft riverboats, including the "Qi Tai," "Qi Ping," "Qi Chun," "Yi An," "Yi Ping," and "Yi Feng." Most of them are the latest gasoline engine models, with new hulls and high speeds, and their construction costs are very high. All nine riverboats are to be sold to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for a price of only 1.2 million yuan. After several meetings, a draft purchase contract is being negotiated. The Chekiang River Company has already sent the registration forms for the hulls, tonnage, dimensions, hatchways, and construction dates of the nine riverboats to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for review. Once the draft contract is signed by both parties, the ships can be delivered on a scheduled date, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will raise funds to pay the American company.</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition Pre-Exhibition Day 16; American Economic Mission Visited Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 16th day of the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. It will close in a week and be transported to England for exhibition from November of this year to March of next year. After the exhibition in England, the exhibits will be transported back and exhibited once in Nanjing, but not in Shanghai again. Therefore, many people in Shanghai, considering the opportunity rare, have been visiting enthusiastically in recent days. The news obtained yesterday is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Economic Mission Visited</p>
<p>The American Economic Mission arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Various circles in Shanghai specially established a reception office to take charge of reception matters. The reception office has contacted the exhibition and was granted free admission to show preferential treatment. It has received a reply from the association, approving the request. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, four members of the reception office accompanied the leader of the American Economic Mission, Forbes, Deputy Leader Carroll, Secretary Stoddart, Accountant Shiverley, and members Dillingham, Rogers, Le May, Hutchins, Wickham, Jones, Bixby, Condict, Minor, Daly, and Condie, a total of 20 people, to visit the exhibition. The person in charge of the association guided them through the exhibits. The mission highly praised the exhibition's orderly presentation of antiquities and admired the greatness of Chinese art and the superiority of Chinese culture. They expressed their gratitude for the free admission.</p>
<p>Working Day and Night to Photograph Exhibits</p>
<p>The association's exhibition this time has a total of more than 940 exhibits. A large portion of them have already been photographed. However, photographing antiquities is different from ordinary photography. The lighting and shooting time must be extremely accurate to capture every detail. Therefore, the number of photos taken each day is small. A portion of the exhibits are still being photographed day and night, striving to complete all the photography before the end of this month.</p>
<p>Private Antiquities Not Collected</p>
<p>The exhibits selected by the association for the London art exhibition have already been reviewed and decided. Antiquities privately owned will not be collected. Recently, someone wrote to the association, offering to transport their privately owned antiquities to England for exhibition. The association has replied one by one, declining the offer.</p>
<p>Gu Shusen Returned to Beijing Yesterday After Completing His Work</p>
<p>Gu Shusen, the permanent director of the association and director of the Ministry of Education, returned to Beijing yesterday morning. Gu is skilled in calligraphy and painting, and specializes in painting bamboo. Recently, he specially painted several bamboo and rock paintings in the association's office and gave them to the association's staff. Lei Zhen, the permanent director of the association, is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing tomorrow. The explanations for the calligraphy and paintings written by the association have been published successively. The following is a summary of the exhibits from the last chapter of the explanation:</p>
<p>Summary of Calligraphy and Painting Exhibits</p>
<p>The calligraphy and painting exhibits this time are limited to the collections of the Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall. Although the various schools and masters listed above cannot be fully represented, the works of important artists from each school have been selected as much as possible. Viewers can also gain a general understanding of Chinese calligraphers and painters and their characteristics. Other items are either unique and unsuitable for traveling far, or of slightly lower quality and not worth listing indiscriminately, or have fragile paper and silk due to age and cannot be hung, or are long scrolls that are difficult to unfold. After careful consideration, the items recorded in this catalog were obtained. In total, there are six calligraphy and painting works from the Tang and Five Dynasties periods, fifty-six painting works from the Song Dynasty, forty-one calligraphy and painting works from the Yuan Dynasty, forty-three calligraphy and painting works from the Ming Dynasty, and twenty-nine calligraphy and painting works from the Qing Dynasty, totaling one hundred and seventy-five items. Although omissions are unavoidable, the system is reliable. This is what we hope viewers will be satisfied with. Furthermore, the methods of mounting Chinese calligraphy and painting are unique to various countries. If there is any damage, it can be repaired. Among them, technicians such as Tang Jie and Wu Wenyu are as famous as the calligraphers and painters themselves. The styles of mounting, such as scrolls and albums, are convenient for storage and exhibition and are also unique to various countries. This is also for the viewers' reference. For ease of reference, a summary of Chinese and Western calendars is listed below: The Han Dynasty is from 142 BC to 220 AD, the Three Kingdoms period is from 221 to 265 AD, the Jin to Sui Dynasties are from 268 to 617 AD, the Tang Dynasty is from 618 to 906 AD, the Five Dynasties period is from 907 to 959 AD, the Song Dynasty is from 960 to 1275 AD, the Yuan Dynasty is from 1276 to 1367 AD, the Ming Dynasty is from 1368 to 1643 AD, and the Qing Dynasty is from 1644 to 1911 AD.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dingfan and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Aviation Patriotic Donation: Excellent Results in Fundraising by Various Teams</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Fundraising Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association received a report from Team 150 leader Shen Yi stating that he had raised more than 600 yuan. Team 168 leader Zhang Jitang reported a collection of more than 310 yuan. Team 212 leader Zhang Xiangwen submitted a third installment of 50 yuan in membership fees. Yesterday, the headquarters continued to issue 100 badges and 10 receipt books for membership fees to Team 246 leader Xu Wanshan, 100 badges and 20 receipt books for membership fees and donations to Team 343 leader Gu Jiwu, 500 membership applications, 200 badges, and hundreds of various promotional materials to Team 36 leader Huang Boqiao, 300 membership applications to Team 342 leader Tang Naikang, 50 donation receipt books to Team 83 leader Tong Xingbai, and 16 donation receipt books to Team 35 leader Song Ziliang.</p>
<p>Team 296 leader Xiao Youmei, who is the president of the National Conservatory of Music, is working very hard on fundraising. He wrote to the headquarters yesterday, proposing to hold a concert, with all proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, to be used for the aviation patriotic fund. It is said that the headquarters is planning the time, location, and ticket prices and has replied, praising his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Team 395 leader Li Zhaohuan, who is the president of National Chiao Tung University, has always been enthusiastic about patriotic movements. He has started working very hard this time, and the results are very impressive. It is said that the school stipulates that all faculty and staff members contribute 6% of their salaries for the aviation patriotic donation, and all students, in addition to joining as members, donate 50 cents each and solicit donations from relatives and friends, demonstrating President Li's concern for the aviation patriotic movement, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Reschedules Meeting with the Press</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Council, originally scheduled to meet with reporters from various newspapers yesterday morning on the third floor of the Bank of China. However, Song had to meet with the financial community due to important official business, so he announced the rescheduling of the meeting. Song plans to travel to Beijing in the next few days to visit President Wang and discuss the National Economic Council's progress. As for the inspection of Sichuan, it will be decided after meeting with President Wang.</p>
<h3>Excessive Tax on Bidding Money; Du Yuesheng Visits Kong to Discuss Reduction; Tax of 7% Affects Business</h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, after the Ministry of Finance imposed a tax on exchange transactions, the Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan reviewed the results and reduced the tax rate in one fell swoop. The Ministry of Finance believed that the tax rate was too low and would invisibly allow speculators to manipulate the market. Therefore, it re-proposed raising the tax rate, and the principle was approved by the Executive Yuan and sent back to the Legislative Yuan for review and reconsideration. It was decided to exempt securities from tax and change the bidding money from 6% to 7% per item. The ad valorem tax on yarn, cloth, grains, and flour was set at 3.5%. The Ministry of Finance has set July 1 as the implementation date. Due to the excessive tax on bidding money, the Shanghai Gold Exchange will be severely affected in the future. Therefore, the board of directors elected the current chairman, Du Yuesheng, to be responsible for requesting a reduction from the authorities. Du went to the Central Bank on the day before yesterday to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, stating the difficulties and requesting Finance Minister Kong to consider the difficulties of businessmen and find a way to reduce the tax to ease the burden on businessmen.</p>
<h3>Minquan Ship First Voyage to the Sichuan River; Yesterday's Reception for All Sectors to Visit</h3>

Those who came to congratulate included China Merchants Bureau General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Sanbei Company General Manager Yu Qiaqing, Maritime Affairs Bureau Director Peng Hu, Jin Cheng Bank Manager Wu Yunzhai, etc. After the visit, all claimed that the most advanced ship on the Sichuan River should belong to that company. Shanghai Manager Zhang Shulin of the company and Zhou Hai, the owner of the Minquan ship, were warmly entertained, and it was quite a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>The Egg Industry Follows Suit and Creates Commercial Acceptance Bills</h3>
<p>After the silk industry initiated commercial acceptance bills, it has attracted the attention of the financial market. Now, it is learned that the Egg Industry Association of this city has also decided to follow suit, sending a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce for the record. The Chamber of Commerce has also replied, approving the request. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Egg Industry Letter</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>It has been observed that commercial acceptance bills have been in use in various countries for a long time. Recently, the business market in our country has been sluggish, currency has tightened, and funds have been exhausted to meet the need. The municipal silk industry association, in view of this, initiated the creation and use of commercial acceptance bills in order to increase the limited capital. The method is ingenious and well-intentioned, and we are extremely pleased. This proposal has been approved by the ninth executive committee meeting of our association. In addition to notifying the industry, a corresponding letter is sent to your esteemed association for the record. Furthermore, the acceptance bill book used by our industry is planned to be purchased from the silk industry association. As for the financial sector, it is planned that colleagues will contact banks and money shops for dealings. This is also enclosed for your information.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Reply</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>On the 22nd of this month, we received your letter stating that your industry proposes to use commercial acceptance bills and plans to purchase the bill book from the silk industry association. As for the method of discount, it is planned that colleagues will contact banks and money shops for dealings. Please file this for the record, etc. Your industry, following the silk industry, uses commercial acceptance bills, which is sufficient to circulate finances and benefit commerce, and set the tone for other industries that have not yet followed suit. We are very pleased. In addition to approving the file for the record, a corresponding letter is hereby sent for your information.</p>

<h3>Postal Service Notice: Regulations for Accepting and Delivering Airmail on the Beijing-Chongqing Route</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 126 states: The China National Aviation Corporation's special Beijing-Chongqing air service will commence on the 10th of this month, with intermediate stops at Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, and Wanxian. Flights will depart from Beijing every Wednesday at 6:30 AM, arriving in Ba County at 5:00 PM on the same day. Return flights will depart from Chongqing every Thursday at 8:00 AM, arriving in Beijing at 6:30 PM. Although this special Beijing-Chongqing service does not fly directly to Shanghai, mail from Ba County, Wanxian, and Yichang destined for Shanghai after the Chongqing-Hankou flight departs on Tuesdays will be transported to Beijing via the Thursday Chongqing-Beijing special flight for transfer to Shanghai. This is faster than the original Chongqing-Hankou-Hankou-Shanghai service, which arrived in Shanghai on Friday afternoons. Additionally, after the Shanghai-Hankou flight departs every Tuesday, mail from Shanghai destined for Jiujiang, Hankou, Wanxian, and Ba County will be sealed and dispatched by the bureau at 3:00 PM that afternoon, transported to Beijing via Special Express Train No. 302, and transferred to the special flight, which is also faster than the original flight that day. This notice is hereby issued for general information.</p>
<h3>Open Letter from the Chinese Physical Society to the Nation: Concerning the Issue of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Chinese Physical Society addresses the nation regarding the issue of weights and measures: Recognizing that the current regulations governing weights and measures in our country contain inaccurate definitions and oversights in the standard system, and that the names of the units are plagued with problems, the society, in its capacity as an academic body, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education in October of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), asking them to convene a conference of academic experts to revise the regulations on weights and measures. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan convened a meeting in the capital on March 1st and 2nd of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) to review the names and definitions of units in the standard weights and measures system, and decided to convene a formal conference in mid-May of this year to revise the regulations. We believe that the issue of weights and measures is of profound and significant importance to science education, industry, national economy, and the people's livelihood, and that all Chinese people should pay close attention to it. Therefore, we are highlighting the main points and offering our humble opinions, hoping that our fellow countrymen will consider them. (1) The Reasons for the Society's Request to Revise the Weights and Measures Regulations: The reasons for the society's request can be divided into three aspects. (A) The definition of volume in the weights and measures regulations for the standard system is inaccurate. Due to historical changes, the current international metric system uses two standards for volume: one is the cubic decimeter, defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one decimeter; the other is the liter, defined as the volume occupied by one kilogram (kg) of pure water at its maximum density. The two definitions use different standards, and although their values are very close, they are not equal. The weights and measures regulations stipulate the "liter" as the unit of volume, calling it a "gong sheng" (公升, liter), and then state that it is equivalent to one cubic decimeter (cubic decimetro), effectively confusing two internationally recognized units that are different. Therefore, it should be revised. (B) Errors in the regulations regarding the weight standard in the weights and measures regulations: The basic units in the weights and measures system, besides length, should be "mass" rather than "weight." Regulations in all countries specify mass because "mass" and "weight" are two fundamentally different physical quantities. Mass represents the amount of matter contained in an object, and its value does not vary with the object's location. Weight represents the magnitude of the Earth's gravitational force on an object, and its value varies with the object's location. Therefore, weight should not be used as a basic unit. However, the weights and measures regulations in our country go against this principle and recognize weight as a basic unit. This is a significant error and should be revised. (C) The naming method adopted in the weights and measures regulations violates the most fundamental spirit of the international metric system, is cumbersome, and leads to many abuses. The most fundamental spirit of the international metric system lies in its use of the decimal system for all units and its completely rational naming method. The decimal system is self-explanatory, so we will only briefly discuss the naming method for comparison. The essence of the international metric system's naming is that each quantity has only one name for its unit. Multiples of ten, hundreds, etc., above this unit, or tenths, hundredths, etc., below it, are indicated by adding a corresponding prefix indicating the quantity to the unit name, without establishing a separate name. This is not like the English system with its foot, inch, pound, ounce, etc., or like our country's system with its li, zhang, chi, cun, jin, liang, qian, fen, etc. This is the simplest and most rational method and should be followed. It is also obvious that units of different quantities should not have the same name to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. In contrast, the names of the units in the standard system defined in our country's weights and measures regulations all inherit the names of our country's old system, prefixed with the word "gong" (公, metric), such as "gong li" (公里, kilometer), "gong chi" (公尺, meter), "gong cun" (公寸, decimeter), "gong fen" (公分, centimeter), "gong jin" (公斤, kilogram), "gong liang" (公兩, hectogram), "gong qian" (公錢, decigram), "gong fen" (公分, centigram), etc. "Gong chi" and "gong jin" are clearly not equal to "chi" (尺, Chinese foot) and "jin" (斤, Chinese pound), but people often like to abbreviate and simplify, so they often shorten "gong chi" to "chi" or "gong jin" to "jin," which has significant consequences. The old system and the newly defined "market system" in our country are not decimal, while the standard system is a decimal system. Continuing to use the old names leads to "one gong chi" being equal to "three market chi," but "one gong li" is not equal to "three market li," and "one gong jin" is equal to "two market jin," but "one gong liang" is not equal to "two market liang." This alone is enough to show that there is no need to inherit the old names for the units of the standard system. Moreover, in our country's old unit names, all those without a specific name are named with "fen" (分), "li" (厘), "hao" (毫), etc. The original intention was to use "fen" for the first decimal place (i.e., "fen" being one-tenth), "li" for the second decimal place (i.e., "li" being one-hundredth), and so on. However, this is no longer the case under the new system. According to the new system, the "fen" in "gong mu" (公畝, are) is one-tenth of it, the "fen" in "gong chi" is one-hundredth of it, and the "fen" in "gong jin" is one-thousandth of it. As a result, the words "fen," "li," and "hao" have lost their original meaning and have no fixed value. In fact, our country's old names were created in an era when science was undeveloped, and no consideration was given to their application in science, which is understandable. Now, instead of seeking to create new names, we are merely imitating the old ones, leading to completely different things in science having to use the same name. For example, when saying that the mass of an object is one "gong fen," not only can its length be one "gong fen," but its cross-sectional area can also be one "gong fen," which is obviously confusing and inconvenient to use. (2) The Principles Followed by the Society When Defining the Terms for Various Units of Weights and Measures: As mentioned above, the names of the units in the standard system defined in our country's current weights and measures regulations are inappropriate. In the "Nomenclature of Physics" defined by our society, the naming of the various units of weights and measures is based entirely on the resolutions of the National Conference on Astronomy, Mathematics, and Physics convened by the Ministry of Education in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Here, at the risk of being verbose, we briefly present the naming principles below. (A) The names of the main units of length and mass are defined as follows: Meter for Meter, Gramme for Gram, Liter for Liter. (Recently, various parties have strongly advocated changing the translation of "sheng" (升) to "li" (立). The names of larger or smaller volume units can also be named according to paragraph (C) below. Our society can also agree to use the word "li.") (B) The nomenclature for large and small numbers is defined as follows: Shi (什) for ten times, Bai (佰) for one hundred times, Qian (仟) for one thousand times, Zhao (兆) for one million times, etc. Fen (分) for one-tenth, Li (厘) for one-hundredth, Hao (亳) for one-thousandth, and Zheng (徵) for one millionth (i.e., one-millionth of Zhao). (C) The names of auxiliary units larger or smaller than the main unit are all prefixed with the corresponding name of the large or small number, without establishing a separate name. For the sake of clarity, we have listed the names of the length and mass units proposed by our society below. (Table of Length Unit Names) Qian Mi (仟米) Kilomefre, Bai Mi (佰米) Hectometre, Shi Mi (什米) Decametre, Mi (米) Metre, Fen Mi (分米) Decimetre, Li Mi (釐米) Centimetre, Hao Mi (毫米) Millimetre. (Table of Mass Unit Names) Qian Ke (仟克) Kilogramme, Bai Ke (佰克) Mectogramme, Shi Ke (什克) Decagramme, Ke (克) Gramme, Fen Ke (分克) Decigramme, Li Ke (釐克) Centigramme, Hao Ke (毫克) Hilligramme.</p>
<p>Reading this table, it is clear that the naming scheme proposed by our society is clear and simple, and completely eliminates the drawbacks of the names defined in the current regulations. It also has the following advantages: (1) There is no need to create new characters or innovate old ones. (2) There is no case of one name or one sound being used for two purposes. (3) Only the name of the main unit needs to be understood, and the names of its larger or smaller auxiliary units are all named according to the same rule. (4) The names of the main units are already quite common in domestic science textbooks. (5) The naming of large and small numbers is consistent with the currently used meanings. (6) These three principles can be extended to other units of physics without establishing another system. These advantages are all facts that can be seen and heard by everyone. Our society does not need to repeat the discussion. (3) The Revision of Scientific Terminology Should Be Presided Over by National Academic Groups and Published by Government Agencies Responsible for Cultural Affairs: Today, with the development of science, the divisions of disciplines are becoming increasingly refined. Those who do not specialize in a certain subject can hardly grasp its full content. Therefore, the definition of scientific terms must be presided over by experts to avoid errors. Once the terms of each discipline have been carefully defined using reasonable methods, the agency that publishes them should be the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for cultural affairs. This is inevitable. The terms of two disciplines are often related to other disciplines. The terms of basic disciplines should be defined first, and then the terms of other specialized disciplines should be addressed. Disciplines with mutual relationships often have the same name, so they should be communicated and unified to avoid discrepancies. All of this work must rely on the Ministry of Education to broadly invite experts to discuss it together to achieve success. However, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after defining the weights and measures regulations, also has plans to proceed with the definition of scientific terms. Our society believes that the names of the weights and measures units are already inappropriate and need to be revised, so we must specifically point out this meaning in order to allow other, more complex scientific terms to be defined through proper channels, so as to avoid future chaos and disputes. The Ministry of Education's National Institute for Compilation and Translation entrusted our society with reviewing the "Nomenclature of Physics," and our society accepted the commission and carefully reviewed it, all based on the above-mentioned principles. Other disciplines should also follow this correct path to achieve good results. However, it is important to note whether the academic group entrusted by the government to revise the terms of a certain discipline has the nature of representing the scientists of that discipline nationwide. If it does have this representativeness, then the government's entrustment is appropriate, and the terms reviewed by it will not be full of errors and become a laughingstock. In short, the need to revise the weights and measures regulations has been recognized by all parties. The revision plan created by our society is based on the drafts of physics nomenclature from previous years over the past twenty years, and the resolutions of the National Conference on Astronomy, Mathematics, and Physics. It is a summary of the opinions of scholars in our field, not just a draft or the opinions of a few people. Here, we have briefly described the above at the risk of being verbose, hoping to improve the weights and measures laws to correct the foundation of academia. Our society is not talented, but we are willing to work together with the people of the country to achieve this.</p>
<h3>Student National Goods Association: Actively Preparing to Promote National Goods Week, Holding Sample Exhibitions in Different Regions, and Determining Preferential Measures for Students</h3>
<p>The Student National Goods Promotion Federation, after holding the citywide student national goods pledge ceremony and exhibiting domestic student supplies on April 18th, is now actively promoting and sparing no effort in carrying out the various planned tasks. In addition to soliciting essays and holding mutual selections, and recruiting members to organize recruitment teams, it has recently been actively preparing to promote National Goods Week, hoping to practically connect producers and sellers to achieve the practical effect of promoting national goods. The details of the plan are as follows: (1) The association is holding National Goods Week to seek practical connections between producers and sellers, hoping to achieve practical results. (2) National Goods Week is tentatively scheduled to be held separately in the following regions, at least once in each region: (A) Pudong District, (B) Punan District, (C) Puxi District, (D) Pubei District, (E) Special District 1, (F) Special District 2. However, if necessary, the association may make other arrangements. (3) The duration of each National Goods Week is set at seven days, and the dates will be determined and announced by the association. (4) During National Goods Week, in addition to holding gatherings and ceremonies in selected locations by the association, the following events will be held on separate days: (A) Sample Exhibitions, (B) Famous Speakers, (C) Costume Lectures, (D) Radio Broadcasting and Promotion, (E) Other Promotional Activities. (5) During National Goods Week, factories or stores in each district that deal in national goods should have the following representations: (A) Factories should designate a place to clearly display their products and indicate preferential measures for students and members of the association. (B) Stores that exclusively sell national goods should display new national goods, especially those suitable for students, prominently during National Goods Week, indicating prices and discount measures. Stores that do not exclusively sell national goods should set up a "National Goods Section" and a "National Goods Showcase" to promote public awareness. (C) All schools holding letters of introduction from the association to purchase goods from factories should be given special preferential treatment. (6) The preferential measures and displayed goods of each factory and store must be genuine. If any fraud or counterfeiting is found, it will be published in the newspaper for reputational sanctions. (8) Matters not covered in these measures may be amended at any time.</p>
<h3>Monthly Cup Match Supplementary Round of the Chinese Corps of the Business Group: New Recruit Yang Tu Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>The March and April Monthly Cup shooting competition of the Chinese Corps and Translation Corps of the International Business Group: The personnel of the four classes A, B, C, and D held the competition at the end of last month, and the results have been published in this newspaper. It is now known that the personnel of Class D and the new recruit class held a supplementary round at the shooting range yesterday. Many people came to the field to participate. The early morning fog had not yet dissipated, and the light was sometimes bright and sometimes dark, so shooting was difficult to achieve satisfactory results. As a result, the new recruit Yang Tu scored 20 points in each of the March and April rounds, which was the highest record of the day, winning the March Monthly Cup. As for April, it was routinely awarded to Zhou Zhixing with 19 points. It is also heard that in order to encourage competition among those who missed out on the Monthly Cup, the team stipulated that those who attend all monthly shoots and have the highest total score for the year but have not won an award will be given a consolation prize in each class. The names of the winners of the consolation prizes for this year are listed as follows: No competition in the Special Class, Liu Anguo of Class A won with 402 points, Qian Liying of Class B won with 324 points, Weng Qinghui of Class C won with 273 points, and Shi Jishang of Class D won with 266 points.</p>

<h3>Large Bomb Explosion: Confirming the Death of Five People</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoquan, a native of Haimen who lived at No. 87 Wan'an Road near the Dongyue Temple in Jiangwan and made a living pushing a small cart, found a bomb more than two feet long while fishing in a small creek there the day before yesterday evening. He took it home to test and throw it, and it exploded on the spot, killing five people. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu Bingwen, the local bailiff of Banliutu, reported to the local court for an autopsy. Inspector Li Caigui was dispatched by the court, along with the coroner, to the scene. The autopsy confirmed that Wang Xiaoquan (22 years old), Wang Limin (25 years old), Hou Zhiqing (59 years old), Cao Ximao (4 years old), and Wang Gendi (4 years old) had all died from the explosion. Some had their abdomens ruptured and intestines flowing out, some had their hands and feet blown off, and some had their heads damaged. The forms of death were varied, and the situation was extremely tragic. After the judge finished the autopsy, he instructed the local bailiff to hurry and notify the family members to quickly prepare the coffins.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting of the Anhui Mutual Aid Society</h3>
<p>There are no fewer than 110,000 Anhui people living in Shanghai, but they lack a spirit of unity. Chen Guanyan, Wu Jianzhi, and other Anhui people in Shanghai, recognizing this, initiated the organization of the "Anhui People's Mutual Aid Society in Shanghai." They have already obtained permission from the municipal party headquarters and have received permit certificate No. 400, authorizing the organization. After receiving the order, the society immediately convened a meeting of the original initiators a few days ago. For the convenience of work, Chen Songping, Wu Jianzhi, Wu Baoyue, Li Jianbai, Lu Nan, Lu Meifeng, Kang Jimin, and seven others were elected as preparatory members to be responsible for handling all preparatory matters. Then, the first preparatory meeting was held, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Revising the society's charter, (2) Allocating work, (3) Hiring an additional recruitment team leader, (4) Determining the date of the preparatory meeting. The meeting lasted for about two hours before adjourning.</p>

<h3>Green Grass and Fragrant Yin, the Spirit of Heroes Lives On: The Tomb Hall of the Unknown Heroes Is Completed: The Construction of Bridges and the Arrangement of Gardens Are Underway, and the Completion of the Entire Project Is Not Far Off</h3>
<p>The local association of this city and all sectors of society are commemorating the soldiers and civilians who died in the January 28th Shanghai War and specially established the Tomb of Unknown Heroes in Miaohang, Jiangwan. Since construction began in July of last year, more than half a year has passed. Now the tomb hall, tomb gate, and memorial monument have all been completed one after another. The construction of bridge projects and the arrangement of gardens are now being accelerated, and the overall completion is not far off. The Dagong News reporter has investigated and reported the details as follows.</p>
<p>Land for Construction After the January 28th Shanghai War in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), many soldiers and civilians in our country died. Afterwards, the local association of this city initiated the construction of the Tomb of Unknown Heroes, so that future generations can admire them. Initially, the five members of the Construction Committee, Hu Yunqiu, Du Chongyuan, Kui Yanfang, Zhang Gongquan, and Zhang Xiaoliang, were responsible for the preparations. The tomb site was selected in Miaohang Town, Jiangwan. Because the area belonged to Baoshan County, fellow villagers from Baoshan in Shanghai and local people voluntarily contacted the association and offered to donate more than 30 mu of tomb land. All parties considered that the area was located in a remote township with inconvenient transportation, so they initiated fundraising to build a road connecting Shanghai to the town, connecting Lingnan Road in Zhabei to the south and Dachang to the west. When collecting land, each mu was given back a land price of 100 yuan. By the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the road was completed. Regarding the construction expenses for all tomb roads, the local association initially allocated 10,000 yuan, and the remaining funds were raised from all sectors of society in Beijing and Shanghai, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. Shen Yi, Xue Cixin, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Yansong, Lin Kanghou, and Dong Dayou were added as construction committee members to assist in the work. Dong Dayou, an architect, was responsible for the voluntary design of the entire project. The road construction project required 20,000 yuan for land and more than 20,000 yuan for bridges along the way, with a total construction cost of more than 50,000 yuan. After the road was completed, construction of the tomb began in July of last year.</p>
<p>Tomb Inscription When the tomb base was started last year, an inscription for the Tomb of Unknown Heroes was written and placed inside the cornerstone for future reference. The original text reads: "In the January 28th War, countless soldiers of our army gave their lives, and countless civilians sacrificed themselves. Their names are unknown, which is truly regrettable, but the spirit of the nation rests on them. This year, the Shanghai Local Association established the Tomb of Unknown Heroes to comfort the loyal souls and encourage future generations. A committee of 13 members was formed to oversee the matter. The members were Hu Yunqiu, Kui Yanfang, Zhang Xiaoliang, Du Chongyuan, Shen Yi, Xue Cixin, Dong Dayou, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Yansong, Lin Kanghou, and Jia'ao. The longest resistance and the fiercest artillery fire were in Miaohang Town. The Baoshan gentry and people assisted with a donation of 33 mu, two fen, one li, two hao, and 1/10000 of a hao of land at No. 10 of the Ju Zi We. We asked our compatriots to collect donations to first build a road connecting to Lingnan Road to the south and Dachang Town to the west, and then build a tomb hall. In July of the 23rd year of the Republic, construction began with the selection of materials. The planner was the architect Dong Dayou, the contractor was the Jiu Ji Construction Company, and the cost of materials and labor was 66,672 yuan, one jiao, and two fen. The cornerstone was laid in November, and the inscription was written by the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng. Therefore, the origin is described and the drawings are hidden. As for the beginning and end of the tomb construction and the beautiful scenery of the garden, they will be recorded in writing at a later date. November, 23rd year of the Republic of China, recognized by Zhang Jia'ao of Baoshan, written by Shi Tongren."</p>
<p>Current Status of the Project Since the Tomb of Unknown Heroes began construction in July of last year, more than half a year has passed. The first to be completed were the tomb gate, the passage, the surrounding walls, the flagpole, the stone steps, the tombstone, and the stone coffin in the tomb (containing the clothes of the deceased). A small stream separates the entrance to the tomb from the tomb hall, so a bridge needs to be built. According to Shi Tongren of the Creation Committee, the tomb hall has now been completed. The stone steps in front of the hall are made of genuine domestic stone, and the stone steps around the hall are made of artificial stone, but the appearance is no different from real stone. The construction cost of the tomb hall is 67,000 yuan. Only the bridge project remains unfinished. The garden surrounding the tomb needs to be arranged in autumn and winter due to seasonal reasons before it can be completed. There is a small pool in the tomb hall to store the stone coffin. The memorial monument (i.e., the tombstone) is located in the hall, more than ten feet high, with the five characters "Tomb of Unknown Heroes" engraved on it. It has been requested that Chairman Chiang write the characters. The memorial inscription will be engraved after the completion. The funding has exceeded the initial budget by more than 20,000 yuan, and the unfinished project still requires 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Municipal Conference Resolution: Opening of the Old City Temple and Yu Garden; Yesterday, a Meeting of the Three Guilds Was Convened to Discuss and Await Separate Decisions Before Further Processing</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, for the purpose of opening the Yu Garden within the Nanshi Old City Temple to allow people of all countries to appreciate it, specifically ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the Sugar, Money, and Bean &amp; Rice Guilds to comply, and also ordered all subordinate bureaus to assist in the handling. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to Cuixiu Hall to convene a joint meeting of relevant agencies and organizations. The following is a record of the information obtained by a reporter from the Industrial Society.</p>
<p>Municipal Conference Decides to Open</p>
<p>The Yu Garden within the Old City Temple in Nanshi City was originally private property owned by the Sugar, Money, and Bean &amp; Rice Guilds. Internally, it is divided into the Dianchun Hall (Sugar Guild), the Inner Garden (Money Guild), and the Cuixiu Hall (Bean &amp; Rice Guild). The pavilions, terraces, and buildings within these three gardens are scattered among each other, with winding paths and corridors that attract visitors. Each blade of grass and tree, the scenery is particularly elegant. Since its construction, it has been hundreds of years, but it has always been locked, excluding tourists. Now, Mayor Wu Tiecheng believes that the three gardens are often closed, depriving people of all countries of the opportunity to appreciate them. Now, for the purpose of providing for people to visit and for international publicity, he specifically raised the matter for discussion at the Municipal Conference this month. Subsequently, the conference decided that the Municipal Government should instruct the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to immediately instruct the authorities of the three guilds to comply, and designated the Social Affairs Bureau as the convener, and instructed subordinate bureaus to assist in the process. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately instructed the three guilds and sent notices to the various bureaus, scheduling the first joint meeting to be held at Cuixiu Hall in the Old City Temple at 1:00 PM on the 23rd of this month (yesterday). Each guild was required to send representatives to participate, it was said.</p>

Subsequently, the representatives of the three guilds expressed their opinions separately, as well as the difficulties in opening. The representatives of the various bureaus also successively explained their respective situations, as well as the future situation. Then, the discussion began on: (1) the original plan for opening; (2) the decision on the opening date. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that the representatives of the three guilds should first convene their respective trades to discuss the principles of opening, and then report the results of the meeting to the Social Affairs Bureau for further discussion before May 15.

<h3>Wusong Fishing Market Approaching; Three Fishing Firms Have Opened Their Doors to Await the Arrival of Boats</h3>
<p>The annual fishing market season in Wusong is approaching. Currently, all fishing boats are opening their nets in the fish-producing waters to catch spring fish. If the weather is favorable, it is hoped that the boats will arrive within the next three to five days. If not, they will definitely arrive by the end of the month at the latest. Therefore, the three fishing firms in this port, namely Cuifeng (the firm name is Cuisheng), Baofeng, and Shentai, sent personnel with the necessary equipment to Wusong in the past two days to open their doors and await the arrival of the fishing boats. In addition, many guest merchants who make a living from the fishing season have also come to Wusong one after another, renting houses to live in and looking forward to the boats' arrival along the riverside every day. As a result, the Wusong market has suddenly become lively in recent days.</p>
<h3>Siamese Travel Group Passes Through Shanghai; A Short Visit Ashore, Departing for Japan This Morning, and Returning to Shanghai via Tianjin in Two Months</h3>
<p>A group of seventeen people from the Siamese Lower House Oriental Travel Group, led by Mr. Caiweier, Minister of Railways of the Kingdom of Siam, arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday on the President Coolidge of the Da Lai Company. They will continue to take the original ship to Japan tomorrow morning, then travel to Gulin in Korea and Northeast China. They will return to Shanghai in about two months for a longer visit. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Siamese Government Oriental Travel Group departed from Siam and made short sightseeing visits to the Philippines, Hong Kong, and other places along the way. The group consists of seventeen people, mostly members of the Siamese parliament. The leader is Mr. Caiweier, Minister of Railways of the Kingdom of Siam. The President Coolidge, which the group is traveling on, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday. However, due to fog along the way, the journey was delayed, and it did not arrive in port until about 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Our Side Welcomes</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu's representative Li Dachao, Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee representative Wu Gonghu, and others boarded the Da Lai Company's reception launch to the President Coolidge to welcome the group. They were greeted by Group Leader Caiweier. Li Dachao, Wu Gonghu, and others conveyed the government's welcome, in order to strengthen diplomatic ties. The group of seventeen then transferred to the reception launch and landed at the New Customs Wharf.</p>
<p>Group Leader's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Group Leader Caiweier, in an interview with reporters from various newspapers on the ship, the organization of this group is semi-official in nature. This time, they are going to Osaka, Japan, to participate in the Oriental Tourism Conference. They will make short sightseeing visits to the places they pass through. They arrived in Shanghai today and also plan to go ashore for a short stay. They will depart on the original ship for Osaka, Japan, tomorrow morning, where they will stay for four weeks. Then they will go to Korea and Northeast China, where they also plan to stay for one week each. From Northeast China, they will go to Beijing and visit for four or five days. From Beijing to Nanjing, they will stay for two days. From Nanjing, they will come to Shanghai again, at which time they will have a longer encounter with everyone, with a stay of about three or four days.</p>
<p>Group Members' Statements</p>
<p>The members of the group are all young, handsome, energetic, and friendly. According to the group members, the purpose of this trip is entirely for sightseeing. Although they do not have sufficient time to travel around China, they still hope to enjoy the beautiful scenery and new constructions in China in many ways and bring them back to their country as a reference. They also hope that this trip will further strengthen the friendship between China and Siam.</p>
<p>Denial of Anti-Chinese Sentiment</p>
<p>Regarding rumors that the Siamese authorities have an anti-Chinese sentiment and restrictions on the education of overseas Chinese in the country, the reporter asked Group Leader Caiweier about this. Caiweier was surprised to hear this. He said that Siam treats the overseas Chinese of any country equally, and that he had never heard of any anti-Chinese sentiment. Regarding education, there are no restrictions in the country. Whether this statement is reliable remains to be verified.</p>
<p>Departing for Japan This Morning</p>
<p>After landing at the New Customs Wharf, the group was led by Municipal Government representative Li Dachao and others on a short tour of the Bund and the main roads in the central district. In the evening, they hired a boat to return to the President Coolidge for the night. This morning at about 8:00 AM, the ship set sail for Osaka, Japan.</p>

<h3>After the Easter Holiday, the Police Resolved More Than 300 Cases; More Than 300 Male Suspects and More Than 100 Female Suspects; The Highest Record of Cases Accepted by the First Special Court</h3>
<p>From the 19th to the 22nd of this month, it was the Western Easter holiday, commonly known as "Foreign Qingming." The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession, as usual, stopped working, and the fourteen police stations under its jurisdiction also stopped handling cases for four days. Starting yesterday, the cases were handled as usual. Because the number of suspects apprehended by each police station was extremely large, the First Special District Court was extremely crowded. In addition to those in the courtroom, there were also many spectators, so each courtroom was overcrowded. Bailiffs maintained order, and many police guards directed vehicles outside the court gate. According to an investigation by the reporter, the cases handled by the fourteen police stations yesterday included 93 simple cases. Presiding Judge Yinghua of the Second Tribunal accepted 61 cases from police stations south of the Suzhou Creek, and Presiding Judge Ye Shengchao of the Fifth Tribunal accepted 32 cases from police stations north of the Suzhou Creek. They were prosecuted by police lawyers Zhang Shizhu and Jiang Baolian. There were 69 local cases, with 10 handled by President Feng Shide of the First Tribunal, 33 handled by Presiding Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Tribunal, and 26 handled by Presiding Judge Liu Yugui of the Eighth Tribunal. Police representative lawyers Wang Yaotang, Li Zhishan, and Qian Xunjiu were responsible for prosecution. The High Court's Second Branch accepted two counter-revolutionary cases, with lawyer Gan Jingxian representing the police. Presiding Judge Shen Yangzeng of the Ninth Tribunal accepted more than 140 cases of contraband, as well as dozens of cases of prostitutes soliciting customers without a license. In summary, the most numerous cases were theft, opium use, gambling, and fraud, totaling approximately 300 cases including contraband. The number of suspects apprehended was 327 males, including one Russian, 20 females, and more than 140 prostitutes. This is the highest record of cases accepted by the First Special District Court in recent times.</p>
<h3>Inspector Hu Prevents Conflict; Chinese and French Police Arrest Each Other</h3>
<p>Gang Zhen, the director of the Xuhui Police Station in western Shanghai, recently received an order from the director to inspect the area from the 22nd to the 24th of this month, drawing Police Chiefs Chong, Yu Fuyao, Pan Xuezen, Hou Dingyi, and Liu Gancheng, along with 27 police officers, on a daily basis. They rode in a transport truck to conduct the inspection. At about 11:00 AM, they were returning to the station in the same truck when, near the Damuqiao on Xujiahui Road, three officers, including French and Vietnamese Chinese police numbered 67, blocked the truck and refused to let it pass. Inspector Hu explained the purpose of the visit to the officer, who then called the police station for instructions. However, the chiefs and officers waited in the truck for a long time without a reply. Inspector Hu then ordered all the chiefs and officers to get out of the truck and walk across the bridge and turn into Xiexu Road in the Chinese area to return to the station (because the bridge was narrow and the truck could not pass). Unexpectedly, the French police officer pursued them aggressively, crossed the bridge to the south, and blocked their path. Fortunately, Inspector Hu and others tried their best to dissuade him, and no major disaster occurred. After the incident, Director Hong immediately reported to the director by phone and requested instructions for handling the matter.</p>

<h3>Detention Center of the Second Special District Court; Detainees Dig a Hole to Escape; Fortunately Discovered and Stopped</h3>
<p>The detainees in the detention center of the Second Special District Court often disregard the law and cause disturbances. Although they have been transferred to the procuratorate for investigation and prosecution, the detainees still show no signs of repentance. On the night before last (the 21st), the detainees held in Special No. 1 in the West Compound dared to conspire to dismantle the iron bars on the window and dig a hole in an attempt to escape. The on-duty guard discovered and stopped them. One iron bar had been dismantled, two had been bent, and the hole had been dug. The three ringleaders were immediately taken out and chained, awaiting investigation and legal action.</p>
<h3>Robbing a Shed and Shooting Someone</h3>
<p>The poor state of society has led to a series of theft cases, which are too numerous to mention in the newspapers. We have never heard of bandits patronizing sheds and robbing them, but unexpectedly, a robbery and assault occurred in a shed on Zhonghua Xin Road in Zhabei the night before last, which is truly unprecedented. The details are recorded as follows: Jiang Tingfu (35 years old), a native of Yangzhou, lived with his wife, Jiang Fang (38 years old), in a shed on Zhonghua Xin Road. Jiang usually made a living pulling a rickshaw, while Fang worked in a factory. The couple worked hard and were barely able to make ends meet. On the second day of the lunar month, Jiang Tingfu received 12 yuan in society dues. It is not known how this was known to thugs, who mistakenly believed that Jiang Tingfu had some savings. At about 1:00 AM on the night before last, three bandits, each armed with a pistol, broke into Jiang's shed. The door of the shed was simple and collapsed at the first touch. At that time, the Jiangs were fast asleep and were startled awake by the noise. The bandits immediately grabbed Jiang Fang and demanded to know where the money was hidden. The woman realized that it was a robbery and screamed in terror. The bandits were angered by her cries and fired a shot, hitting the woman in the throat. The second shot hit her in the neck, and she immediately fell to the ground injured. Seeing that they had caused a major disaster, the bandits did not dare to rob and fled in a panic. After the bandits left, Jiang Tingfu went forward to check and saw his wife lying in a pool of blood, already dead. Fresh blood was still gushing from her neck and throat. Jiang could not help but wail loudly at the sight. The Tanziwan police learned of the incident and immediately ordered the police to search for the bandits in all directions, but to no avail. They then went to the scene of the incident to investigate. Yesterday morning, the local headman Wang Shaoting reported the case to the local court and requested an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Li Caigui, accompanied by Coroner Yi Zhiming, arrived at the scene. The autopsy revealed that Jiang Fang had two gunshot wounds, and the trachea had been severed. It was determined that she died from the injuries. The coroner ordered that the body be collected by the family members, pending the arrest of the bandits for investigation.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News About Commercial Ships: Yili Loses Its Engine Blade, Old Ning Shao Collides with Qi Han and E Dong, Yong Shun Collides with a Sailboat and Loses Lumber</h3>
<p>Yili Loses Anchor</p>
<p>The Yili, which sails between Shanghai and Wenzhou, lost its engine blade on this trip from Wenzhou to Shanghai in the Wuli waters off Wenzhou. The ship was unable to move, and the reason is unknown. The shipowner was in a difficult situation and requested the Taizhou, which sails the same route, to tow it. The Taizhou then sailed from Haimen to the Huangmen waters (near Wuli) and towed the Yili from Huangmen back to Shanghai. The Yili Company reassembled all the machine blades, and the Taizhou also had to recognize the towing fee, so the losses were significant.</p>
<p>Ning Shao Damaged</p>
<p>When the Old Ning Shao of the Ning Shao Company was berthing at the pontoon dock of the Ning Shao Wharf in Hankou at 7:40 PM on the 19th of this month, the Qi Han and E Dong, two dispatch ships, were swept away by the turbulent water from upstream and drifted to that location. They violently collided with the bow of the Old Ning Shao, and the keel of the bow was immediately damaged. Wang Shunfu, the acting shipowner, immediately inspected the damage and found that the iron plate on the outside of the bow at a point fifteen feet above the thirteen-foot waterline was bent inward by about two feet. In addition to notifying the Ning Shao Warehouse in Hankou in writing and negotiating with the two dispatch ships, Ning Shao arrived in Shanghai yesterday, reported to the company, and sent a letter to the China Ship Insurance Association to wait for a commissioner to inspect the damage.</p>
<p>Yong Shun Collision</p>
<p>The Yong Shun of the Datong Xing Company, which sails the Shanghai-Beiyang route, was sailing from Longkou to Dengzhou at 7:30 AM on the 2nd of this month when it collided with the Zhang Zengshun's sailing boat near Lejiakou due to the dark weather. The sailboat was damaged and lost several pieces of lumber. Fortunately, none of the crew members were injured. The captain of the Yong Shun and the crew members of the sailboat went to the Dengzhou Customs to report the incident, and the Customs signed the report. The matter is still under negotiation, and the amount of the loss is unknown. According to a telephone call from the head office of the Zhengji Company, the company's Hui'an encountered a storm on the Beiyang route and took shelter, damaging a small boat belonging to Yuanchang. The loss was minor. According to a telegram from Yuanchang, the loss is estimated at 300 yuan, and negotiations are underway to claim compensation.</p>
<h3>Using the Name of Opening a Carpet Company; Actually Manufacturing Drugs; Supervised by a Westerner's Houseboy; Master Finds Out and Reports to Police, Case Solved</h3>
<p>Zhao Jianqiu, a native of Zhili, and Wang Huifang, Shen Juchuan, and others jointly established a drug manufacturing organization, hiring a certain engineer to be responsible for the manufacturing work and selling the drugs to various places. Later, due to a dispute over profit sharing between the engineer and Wang and Shen, they broke up. The engineer left without saying goodbye. Zhao and others were deeply afraid that the engineer would be detrimental to them, so they had to close down the business and move to a better location. Because they did not have a suitable location at the time, Zhao Jianqiu consulted with his fellow villager Wu Ruqing. Wu was a houseboy for Hagen, the manager of the electric power company at No. 17 Lusanne Road in the French Concession, so he agreed to temporarily store some of the drugs and equipment at Wu's place. Wu Ruqing then asked his friend Pan Genlin, also a native of Zhili, to find a solution. After several discussions, Pan, although he was also a houseboy for a Westerner at No. 11 Pushi Road in the French Concession, did not dare to store the rest of the drugs because he had not obtained the consent of his master. They then rented a house at No. 12 and a half next door. On the surface, it was to open a carpet company, but in reality, they were preparing to secretly manufacture and sell drugs. They appointed Zhao Jianqiu as the manager, so they had been busy cleaning the house and arranging the equipment in recent days. Just as they were preparing to choose an auspicious day to open, Wu Ruqing's secretive actions were discovered by his master, Hagen. On the afternoon of the 18th of this month, he called the Jing'an Temple police station and said that his houseboy Wu Ruqing had engaged in private drug manufacturing. He asked them to send detectives to investigate immediately. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately sent Chinese detective Shi En and Western detective Ma Ya to arrest Wu. They then went to No. 12 and a half Pushi Road and arrested Pan Genlin, Zhao Jianqiu, Liu Zhongxian, Li Deyuan, and the woman Zhao Wu, and seized manufacturing equipment, rubber tubes, test tubes, glass measuring instruments, 18 bottles of hydrochloric acid, empty coffee essence cans, and other items at the above two locations. They were all taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, in addition to prosecuting according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, also stated the facts of the case, saying that the main culprits Wang Huifang, Shen Juchuan, and others were still at large and had not been apprehended, so he requested a postponement. When questioned, the defendants, except for Li Deyuan, who said that he was a performer in the flying dance troupe on the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company, and Zhao Wu, who said that she was a prostitute who was hired by Zhao Jianying to accompany him, gave evasive answers. They also hired Wu Linkun and Fan Gang as lawyers to defend them. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confessions and ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody pending a new trial next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Aesop's Circus Has Already Opened</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Gas Company to Implement New Price List on a Regular Basis, Starting May 1</h3>
<p>In order to allow users to share in the benefits of the new gas plant, the Shanghai Gas Company has decided to implement a new price list starting May 1 of this year. This will enable the general users to benefit from this. The new price list is called the Dual Tariff Plan. The price of gas used for water heaters (including fountains), stoves, and boilers will be reduced by 21 percent. The previous price was 2 yuan and 8 jiao 5 fen per thousand cubic feet, but now it will only be 2 yuan and 1 jiao 5 fen. However, this benefit can only be enjoyed by those who use gas for cooking in addition to hot water. The regulations are as follows: (1) Gas used for cooking, hot water, and/or stoves will be equipped with separate meters for distinction. (2) The price of gas for cooking will still be calculated at 2 yuan and 8 jiao 5 fen per thousand cubic feet, and will not be changed. For those who use less than 900 cubic feet, the minimum price of 2 yuan and 5 jiao will still be charged. (3) Those who enjoy the benefit of 2 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen per thousand cubic feet must use 3,500 cubic feet or more per month. (4) Under this new plan, there is no minimum consumption requirement for gas used for hot water and/or stoves. (5) Existing users who have cooking appliances and water heaters will not be charged extra for installing separate meters. If the new meter is not installed by May 1, the discount will be based on the reading of the newly installed meter. (6) Users who already have cooking appliances and install a separate water heater will be charged 10 yuan for installation. Users who already have a water heater and install a separate cooking appliance will be charged 7 yuan and 5 jiao for installation. The installation fee for each stove and boiler is 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Child Trafficking Case Cracked on the Hai'an Ship</h3>
<p>The Water Police reported that they had received a telegram from the Wenzhou Public Security Bureau through Shi Weijun, the special commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that the company's Hai'an ship, which had set sail from Wenzhou to Shanghai this time, had child traffickers who had abducted three young children and were on the ship. They requested that the police pay attention and send officers to investigate and arrest them. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately sent detectives Huang Zhenlin, Hu Changqing, and Liang Shenqing, along with Commissioner Shi, to wait at the wharf. It was not until 12:45 PM yesterday that the Hai'an ship arrived and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The detectives immediately boarded the ship to investigate and found the traffickers Lin Chaogeng (also known as Lin A'gen, 40 years old, from Wenzhou) and Pan Taihuang (39 years old, from Wenzhou), as well as the three abducted boys Liang A'zeng (17 years old), Liu A'en (17 years old), and Lin A'liang (16 years old, all from Wenzhou) in the steerage. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, a letter was prepared and sent to the local court to transfer all the people. Prosecutor Li interrogated them and ordered that Lin and Pan be detained for further investigation. The victims Liang A'zeng and the other two boys were temporarily detained pending their families' arrival to claim them and be reunited.</p>

<h3>Calligraphy Masterpieces by Zhong Yao and Cai Xiang Offered for Sale</h3>
<p>In our country, the calligraphy of famous historical figures has always been regarded as a national treasure. Among all the world's written languages, Chinese characters, with each character representing a sound and standing independently, are unique. Other languages are formed using phonetic spellings. This is why Chinese characters are so precious. Zhong Yao (Yuan Chang), a figure from the Wei Dynasty, is considered to have created first-rate calligraphy in Chinese history. Zhong Yao and Wang (Xizhi) are always mentioned together. Zhong Yao's calligraphy is even more valuable than Wang Xizhi’s. Cai Xiang, styled Junmo, served as Shangshu during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty. His calligraphy has long been praised by the art world. The authentic works of such figures are rare treasures in our country, and all Chinese people should cherish them. A certain gentleman from Zhejiang Province, currently studying abroad, finds it difficult to protect such precious items due to the prevalence of bandits in his hometown. This is particularly true for calligraphy and paintings, which require even greater care. Currently, this gentleman has brought these two calligraphic works (authentic pieces by Zhong and Cai) to Shanghai and is willing to sell them. For the sake of preserving national treasures, he has rejected several offers from foreigners. If there are domestic collectors who love Chinese culture and can ensure their safekeeping, he is willing to sell them at a low price to prevent these national treasures from flowing abroad. These two pieces were originally Imperial Collection, later entering the household of a certain Prime Minister. Therefore, the scrolls bear the seals of the Eight Treasures and inscriptions by court historians. After the Republic of China was established, the Prime Minister's family declined, and their descendants sold these treasures. At that time, the gentleman's late father, who was living in Hangzhou, feared that these national treasures would fall into the hands of foreigners and be either transported abroad or ruined. Therefore, he purchased them at a high price and treasured them. Now that the gentleman's late father has passed away, he finds it difficult to protect them and has decided to sell them at a low price.

<h3>Central Party Headquarters Basketball Team Lost to Youyou Last Night: 39 to 62, Plays Social Affairs Bureau This Morning</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters basketball team played its second game in Shanghai last night. Unfortunately, they lost to Youyou by a score of 62 to 39. The first half was very close, with Youyou leading by two points, 24 to 22. This morning at 11:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters team will play against the Social Affairs Bureau team in the downtown area. At 7:00 PM, they will play against the Weiming team, still at the Youyou basketball court.</p>
<p>The Central team is better at offense than defense. Their coordination seems to be inferior to Youyou's. Under the Central team's strict defense, the situation was unusually close. After Sun Hupei opened the scoring, Youyou took a 4-0 lead, then 7-2. The Central team counterattacked and took an 8-7 lead. Youyou then took the lead again, 14-13, and at halftime, Youyou led by two points, 24-22.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Central team's guard, Tang Shaohua, gradually exhausted his energy due to excessive engagement. Youyou's Sun Hupei, Hu Youcheng, and others became more courageous as they fought. After 32-24, the situation became clear. The Central team allowed Youyou to attack fiercely, and the outcome was largely determined. Although the Central team repeatedly adjusted its lineup, the score difference became even greater. As a result, Youyou won 62-39.</p>

<h3>Chi-Tse and Guanghua Middle Schools Win Right to Finals: Pudong Provincial Shanghai Middle School Competes for Final Spot Today</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation basketball league, two games were played yesterday: (1) Chi-Tse defeated Guanghua 27-24; (2) Shanghai University defeated Fudan 46-24. Chi-Tse and Guanghua had both won all three of their previous games in Group C. Yesterday's match was essentially a battle for the right to the finals, and was therefore very important. No less than 200 male and female students from Guanghua came to cheer their team on. Chi-Tse had fewer supporters due to the long distance and difficult journey. The tension in the basketball court was no less than that of the Sino-American finals. Every basket was met with applause and cheers. As a result of the intense battle, Chi-Tse defeated Guanghua 27-24. The details of the first and second halves are as follows:</p>
<p>In the first half, under the command of A Pang Dai Changru, the two teams began to compete. Guanghua's right forward, Chen Bangben, was petite and lively. He shot from the left corner and scored first, to the thunderous applause of the Guanghua cheerleaders. Chi-Tse's players were all veterans of the arena and remained calm. Left forward Chen Yunfan took the opportunity to break through and lightly tried his hand, and sure enough, he scored, tying the score at 2-2. From then on, their momentum increased greatly, and they scored two more baskets, making it 6-2. Seeing that the situation was not good, Guanghua requested a timeout to calm their troops. In the ensuing battle, there were ups and downs. Fighting hard until the end of the first half, Chi-Tse led 17-12.</p>
<p>During the lemon break, Guanghua received instructions from their brain trust, Dong Xiaopei, and coach, Dong Jingnan. They showed great improvement after the start of the second half. The score gradually became closer and closer, from close to tied, and from tied to overtaking Chi-Tse. The atmosphere in the basketball court changed rapidly. At this critical moment, Chi-Tse's captain, Jiang Xuexin, immediately called a timeout to discuss a counter-attack strategy. However, after struggling until a minute before the end, Chi-Tse was still one point behind. Guard Xu Jianqing, seeing that time was running out, shouted and encouraged himself to move forward, broke through the siege, scored a basket, and took the lead by one point. Then Chen Yunfan took advantage of the situation to score another basket. The final buzzer sounded, and the fierce battle ended. As a result, Chi-Tse won the right to the finals by a score of 27-24. The schedule for today and the results of yesterday's games are listed below:</p>

<h3>My Philosophy as a Basketball Referee (II)</h3>
<p>— Authored by Mr. Dahl of the United States, Translated by Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Immediate Judgment - In addition to the aforementioned, a referee must possess another crucial characteristic: the ability to render swift and accurate judgments on fouls. All fouls should be declared immediately; delays of several seconds are unacceptable. This does not imply anticipating fouls or declaring them an instant or seconds before they actually occur. Crucially, a foul must be established and clearly observed before the whistle is blown.</p>
<p>In other words, the referee's mind should not have time to ponder or debate the validity of a foul or whether it should be called. If a referee claims to arbitrarily enforce rules strictly or leniently, they undoubtedly commit the aforementioned error.</p>
<p>Related to this is a school of critics who argue, "Unintentional fouls or fouls far from the center of play can be ignored and not called." A certain newspaper review stated, "In the heat of a game, unintentional fouls by players are inevitable. If a referee insists on calling them, it is both unreasonable and lacks common sense." Another said, "Calling unintentional fouls far from the center of play unduly delays the game's progress. Should a referee then pause upon seeing a foul and debate whether it is a genuine foul, an intentional foul, far from the center of play, or committed by a team lagging behind in score? Should I then differentiate the declaration of fouls or execute it as is, or await closer competition before enforcing stricter penalties?"</p>
<p>A referee should never lightly relax during a game, regardless of how easy or one-sided it may seem, as tension can arise at any moment. If a referee hesitates or is unsure and questions whether a foul should be called, they will immediately lose the ability to manage the game and quickly find themselves in an awkward position. Once a referee loses control, trouble ensues and is difficult to recover from. At that point, misfortune arrives before the game is over or even concluded. In a one-sided game, never relax or show sympathy for the losing players by not calling their fouls. Fortune can be unpredictable; the struggle may quickly become close. If you have relaxed the rules for one side, the other will expect the same treatment, disrupting fairness and leading to immediate chaos. Relaxation by referees in one-sided games is a natural tendency, making them harder to officiate than close games, where referees are generally more cautious.</p>
<p>Consistent and Impartial Throughout - Another mistake referees must be particularly mindful of is becoming accustomed to anticipating an easy game. This is most likely to occur in a one-sided game when one team has a commanding lead. In reality, no game should be taken lightly. If a referee anticipates a certain outcome, the game may turn out the opposite, leading to a cascade of problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, referees should not be concerned about one team committing more fouls than the other (whether in the first half or after the game). Referees should not check the record book during or after the first half to see the number of fouls they have called, or who committed them, as this may lead to attempting to equalize fouls in the second half.</p>
<p>Equalizing fouls between teams is something a referee must avoid at all costs, even if requested. If both teams have an equal number of fouls at the end of the game, that is simply a coincidence. In most games, it is natural for one team to commit more fouls than the other. The losing team may commit more fouls than the winning team due to aggressive defense and hasty actions. Smaller teams may commit more fouls than taller ones due to their tendency to grab, leading to fouls. However, taller teams may sometimes commit more fouls than smaller ones due to their tendency to push or surround opponents. If a foul is clearly committed, do not let the fact that one team is being penalized more affect your continued calling or punishment.</p>
<p>This raises the question: "How many fouls should be called in each game to be appropriate?" Even after discussion by hundreds of people, seeking an average number is futile. Therefore, any attempt to find an average number of fouls per game is highly questionable. Who can or, more importantly, who should dictate that? While reviewing last year's league records, I found two consecutive games particularly interesting, both officiated by the same two referees. In the first game, there were thirteen fouls, divided eight to five. In the second game, there were twenty-eight fouls, divided fifteen to thirteen. Why thirteen fouls in one game and twenty-eight in the other? Why dwell on such facts or even consider the reasons for the difference? The referees cannot create fouls, nor are they at fault for them. Whether there are ten, twenty, or thirty fouls, they are caused by the players and are not the referee's responsibility; they merely declare them.</p>
<p>Calling Too Many Fouls - A common criticism is that too many fouls are called during a game relative to its length, and that too many games are won by free throws. If twenty fouls are called for both teams combined (regardless of the level of play), that is one foul every two minutes of the game. If thirty fouls are called, that is one foul every minute, effectively halting the game half the time. However, considering the rapid pace of the game, such a ratio of fouls is not surprising.</p>
<p>Regarding the point that calling too many fouls delays the game, the answer can be "Yes" or "No," depending on the referee and their skills. One referee may call ten fouls and delay the game, while another may call thirty fouls and maintain a pace no slower than the one calling ten. My highest record is forty-eight fouls. I mention this not to boast about calling so many, but to highlight the fact that after the game, both teams commented on how quickly it was played and that no one, including the officials, realized so many fouls had been called. That game was a close encounter between two strong opponents. Readers should easily grasp the point.</p>

<p>Chronicles</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Excerpt)</p>
<p>In ordinary letters, the writer's name is usually written at the end. Unsigned anonymous letters, logically speaking, should be called "tailless letters." However, people generally do not call them "tailless letters" but "headless letters." This is truly putting the cart before the horse!</p>
<p>Merchants selling goods, no matter what, always end up making some money. As the saying goes, "Sell a thousand, sell ten thousand, never sell at a loss." However, stores currently having clearance sales often use red paper with the words "regardless of cost." Furthermore, they often tell merchants, "This is a loss." If you are not considering the cost, then why not just give the goods away without taking any money? If it's a loss, then what is the point of making a profit?</p>
<p>On the one hand, accepting high praise from people, and on the other hand, also giving high praise to others. In this way, you neither wear other people's praise, nor do you give praise to others. Wouldn't that be refreshing! However, most people in the world are unwilling to do this. This is probably because they have deeply studied the philosophy of "eating, defecating, feces fertilizing the grains, grains then turning into feces."</p>
<h3>Ah Xia</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>Ah Xia is the most lively of our colleagues. She has a beautiful face, charming eyes, and always walks with a twist. Especially when her clear singing voice comes from the music room, everyone feels like they've drunk a glass of rich wine.</p>
<p>But now Ah Xia has left here, and the time she left was so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The fact is this:</p>
<p>Due to family financial reasons, she was betrothed by her despicable parents to Mr. Gu, who already has two children, since she was young. Naturally, she felt extreme pain, but what can she do? Opposing this unsatisfactory marriage is opposing the lives of her parents.</p>
<p>But she did not give up her youth. She needed a loyal lover, just as she needed life. She constantly cast sparks of her love towards people. Finally, her spark stopped with Mr. Gong. But she couldn't bear to lose her parents, losing their livelihood because of her. On the other hand, she used clever tricks to perfunctorily deal with Mr. Gu.</p>
<p>Since she swallowed this heavy bomb, she has been worried day and night. Recently, she has coughed up blood several times.</p>
<p>It seems that the creator is specifically making fun of her. The heavy bomb finally exploded.</p>
<p>It was on the evening of last Sunday that Gong and Gu unexpectedly met in her school. Undoubtedly, Mr. Gong was so angry that he fainted, while Mr. Gu used his cunning smile, forcing her into his trap. So she took this step—suicide, fortunately saved quickly, and is now well.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, she has officially been living as a wife, while Mr. Gong, in extreme sadness, has gone to live his wandering life.</p>
<p>After she left, the colleagues all seemed to have lost something, and they did not see the arrival of spring, although at this time the peach blossoms are everywhere, showing off their tempting beauty.</p>
<h3>Fairy Rainbow Clear Song</h3>
<p>— Xinyun</p>
<p>For a year and a half, I often went to the Fairy Rainbow Society with my music friends Zhezun and Shouou to listen to the pure song without any worldly atmosphere. I actually became addicted. On average, I had to go once every three days. When I went, I always listened from the noisy gong and drum to the end of the performance, and I also had to bring a few music scores to carefully chew on. It was even more serious than attending class in school before. Therefore, I met several Kun opera performers worth admiring. Now, before they leave Shanghai to go elsewhere, I will write them out and introduce them to the public:</p>
<p>Zhu Chuanming - He is the pillar of the Fairy Rainbow Society, singing young female roles and supporting roles. He has the elegant name of Mei Lanfang of Kun opera. His specialty lies in the fact that his body, face, and hands all have drama, and the melody he sings is even more modulated, with rhythm and pace, making you feel unspeakable interest when you listen. And his daily private life is very proper and quiet, like a child of an old family.</p>
<p>Shen Chuankun - The painted face role is the most difficult role to sing. There are not many good painted face roles in Peking opera. In Kun opera, Mr. Shen really dominates. (However, he sings the martial painted face; Fairy Rainbow Society also has Mr. Shao Chuanyong, who specializes in civil painted face, and is also very good.) The Guan Gong opera he sings is especially outstanding, especially the "Single Pole Meeting". I dare say that there is no second person other than him. His sonorous voice is indeed no less than Mr. Jin Shaoshan.</p>
<p>Zhao Chuanjun - This one can be said to be the standard Tang Emperor. He sings "Hall of Eternal Life", and every part is good. Once, I went through heavy rain just to hear him sing "Listening to the Bells". After listening, I was extremely satisfied and couldn't wait to find Brother Muqin to introduce him to record records.</p>
<p>Ni Chuanyue - He sings male roles, supporting roles, or old male roles. Whether he wears a black beard or a white beard, his appearance is extremely pure. His voice is excellent. The "Ballad" and "Drafting the Edict" will make you listen to it and not know the taste of meat for three months.</p>
<p>Yao Chuanxiang - He sings supporting female roles and can perform many plays. No matter which role he plays, he will never disappoint people. Shouou said he was like Furong Cao in Peking opera, and that's indeed correct. He doesn't sing many main scenes, often pairing with people, but none of the old connoisseurs do not praise him. He can indeed be regarded as a very capable person.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhou Chuanying, Zhang Chuanfang, Shi Chuanzhen, and Shen Chuanzhi, Zhu Chuanqian, etc., each have their own special skills, which cannot be written out all at once; there is also the rising star Fang Chuanyun, who sings seriously and is willing to listen to others. Yun will definitely be an outstanding person in the future.</p>
<h3>Varying Degrees of Seriousness!</h3>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Drunkard</h3>
<p>— Juanlong</p>
<p>A few rays of dawn broke through the cracks in the walls and leaked in through the window holes, but the room was still dim. Hu Dahai, who had been drunk all night, was supposed to be awake at this time as usual. His mouth was dry and bitter, and his stomach was rumbling. He rolled out of bed, and habitually tossed the old black cloth quilt, which had been dyed with a layer of dirty blue flowers, towards the inside of the bed. He picked up the cup of cold tea left over from last night, which had seeped into a layer of ash, and sent it to his mouth—</p>
<p>"Damn it! If you don't return to your hometown, I won't drink this cold tea anymore!"</p>
<p>He opened his hazy, lost eyes and saw a "mirror box" next to the teacup that his wife used to dress up in the past, and he muttered again. But muttering was his old habit, and the death of his wife and children had no effect on squeezing out a tear.</p>
<p>He has forgotten when he last wore his clothes, and he doesn't know if he has changed them—perhaps he has no clothes to change, and he doesn't know how to wash them. Every night, after getting drunk, he sleeps in his clothes until dawn. The front of his clothes has been stained with wine stains, oil stains, and saliva, which has accumulated like a barber's stropping cloth. He has completely forgotten how many months he has not cut his hair and beard.</p>
<p>For the sake of wine, he squandered a small fortune. His brother also treated him like a dead person. He is a lonely person, but he did not feel that this was sad—his heart has been stiffened by the wine. Since his wife and children died, he loved wine even more. Half a kilogram, a few peanuts, he sat calmly on the street, drinking alone, like a living god. Once the wine reached a certain amount, his mouth would mutter incessantly like the water of the Yellow River. But what was he muttering? No one could hear it, and no one wanted to listen. When he was excited, he would curse loudly! Who was he cursing? Even he himself couldn't figure it out! He cursed whoever he thought of, and whoever heard it would give him a beating. But he wouldn't resist, but said:</p>
<p>—Old brother! You won't be wrong to hit me! You will always be good to me!</p>
<p>Go ahead and hit me!"</p>
<p>The person who hit him and the shop assistants who were lying on the counter laughed it off. When his brother saw this situation, he could only sigh—</p>
<p>"Alas! The ancestors have never done anything bad, but they gave birth to such a "loser", it's also "fate"!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, when Hu Dahai didn't have money to buy wine, he would vent his anger on his brother:</p>
<p>"Humph! You are relieved to inherit Afa's share of the property! You still have two sons earning money outside! You are relieved!…… You look down on me! Hey! You are just relying on your two sons! I am broke! I am finished!……"</p>
<p>His brother originally ignored him, but sometimes he really couldn't stand to hear it! He slapped him a few times! "You damned ghost, are you angry that my two sons are better than you? Are you angry that I got Afa's property? You can also have sons to inherit! Do you want to squander all the property of these three houses for you to drink?"</p>
<p>He touched his red face—</p>
<p>"Okay! You hit me! It's right for the older brother to hit the younger brother! I'm wrong! I'm wrong……</p>
<p>His footsteps were light and heavy, and his body seemed to be a paper shell. Even on a flat road, he would fall down. Sometimes his teeth fell out with blood, sometimes a piece of skin was scraped off his face, sometimes his face was stained with mud, sometimes…… But he didn't feel any pain or shame—</p>
<p>"Okay! You hit me! I……I deserve to die! You……good……." Then he let out a sinister laugh.</p>
<p>He stepped into the low and dilapidated house, which was dark and filled with a cloud of gray steam. The old and dilapidated furniture that had faded red paint was covered with a layer of ash. The room was very desolate, like an abandoned ancient temple.</p>
<p>But as soon as he lay down on the bed, he fell asleep.</p>
<h3>Record of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Written by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>To embroider a pair, you have to re-stretch this square of tribute satin, so that the second shoe upper to be embroidered can be moved up, so that the person embroidering doesn't have to lower their head to accommodate it, which can save a little bit of eyesight. However, the four or five shoe uppers on each piece of tribute satin can never be embroidered with the same kind of flower. Often the first shoe upper is embroidered with plum blossoms, while the second is embroidered with peonies. Therefore, the person embroidering has no old articles to copy, and must cut out paper flowers again, and find another fresh flower that can be used as a specimen, re-determine the location, and choose the color. The experience gained from embroidering the first shoe upper is simply useless at all. The waste of energy is indescribable. No wonder I would shake my head when I first saw it!</p>
<p>When all the procedures are fully prepared—that is to say, the pattern on the shoe upper has been embroidered, the heel and the sole have been nailed together, and the shoe upper has been sewn to the sole to form a complete phoenix shoe—there is still a final procedure, which is the procedure of mounting ornaments such as jewelry. The Empress Dowager's phoenix shoes have all kinds of precious ornaments such as pearls, gemstones, jade, and jadeite. But what she loves most is pearls. She often said that pearls are the most suitable decoration for phoenix shoes. She likes pearls of all sizes. Therefore, almost none of her phoenix shoes are not studded with pearls. The smaller pearls are strung together with silk thread, strung like a lace, and then curved and bent and nailed to the shoe upper. Although the only thing that connects them is a very thin silk thread, which seems easy to break, I have lived in the palace for several years, but I have never seen them break, nor have I ever heard of anyone picking up a pearl that fell from the Empress Dowager's phoenix shoes.

<p>Holiday Affects Foreign and Local Bank Surges; Benchmark Gold Price Breaks 800 Yuan Mark; Once Reaching a New Low of 793 Yuan; A Sharp Drop of 9.8 Yuan Compared to Before the Holiday Closure</p>
<p>Due to the Spring Festival holiday closure, the gold market has been inactive for days. During this period, overseas silver markets have risen. Coupled with the closure of two major native banks in the city, the market was indirectly stimulated, resulting in a significant drop yesterday. Initially, due to the Spring Festival holiday, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both rose. Dealers also claimed that after the market closed, transactions occurred above the listed price of 1875. The forward silver price in Montreux also increased, and exchange rates slightly decreased. London's raw gold rose by three pence, boosting confidence in the downstream market. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened, immediately retreating to 8067 yuan. With supply exceeding demand, buyers were hesitant, exacerbating the selling pressure, further breaking the 800 yuan mark. The central bank's listed prices were announced, with both the UK and the US rising, but the customs gold unit fell by eight li. The benchmark gold standard price dropped to 862 yuan and 7 jiao. The morning opening was even lower. Although some sought to cover their short positions after the opening, the rise was temporary due to traffic congestion. As soon as there was supply, selling pressure rose again, continuing the decline to a new low of 793 yuan. The foreign exchange market remained stable, and major players took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, gradually pushing the price back up to outside the 800 yuan mark. Sellers became active at the higher prices. The silver equalization tax was announced without any changes. After this, there was a slight dip, but banks maintained their positions at the low prices. The Dalian group also purchased, and the foreign exchange market remained stable. Rui Xing and others aggressively covered their short positions, pushing the price back above the 800 yuan mark, creating a brief rally. However, due to unstable confidence, and selling activity, major players also began to close their positions, causing the price to fall again after the rise. However, the domestic market did not strengthen again, and the afternoon session fluctuated around the 800 yuan level. The post-market opened steadily, with the Dalian group, Wan Xing, and others still selling, slightly depressing the market. Later, due to a report of falling Indian silver prices (9 Annas), buying interest revived, pushing the price back above the 800 yuan mark. However, there was significant selling pressure at the higher prices. Subsequently, after another report of falling Indian silver prices (small 3.3.2 Annas), the foreign exchange market tightened further, with demand exceeding supply, causing prices to rise. Finally, the market presented a fluctuating pattern, but the trend was relatively stable. The day's market started weak but ended steady. The inconsistency in the foreign exchange market was a significant factor. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>

This caused temporary market chaos and tightened credit conditions. While the interbank lending rate remained at ten cents, the demand for "head money" (urgent short-term loans) soared, opening at forty cents and closing at forty-three cents, a more than tenfold increase compared to previous days.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Positive News Causes Public Bonds to Rise Suddenly, Short Squeeze; This Month's Gold Short Stands Out at a Huge One Yuan Gain, with Other Gains Ranging from One or Two Jiao to Five or Six Jiao</p>
<p>At the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange yesterday, as it was the last day of April futures, and just as rumors spread about the establishment of a pound loan and the further issuance of 200 million yuan in paper currency, the financial situation temporarily meant that the positions were not too tight. Furthermore, because the market price had been sluggish but not collapsing for days, most floating long positions had been cleared out, and short selling began to form a short squeeze to cover losses. On the floor, the North Group sold, with the November position being the most popular. On the surface, large players were still mostly selling, while retail investors were enthusiastic in buying. Today, only one month of May futures is being traded, and the market should be safe. The 96 position suddenly rose again, seemingly still due to speculative sentiment. The rumor that trading is not allowed on the floor still has not been confirmed. Yesterday, the market opened up, and buying interest surged, but it was scattered and not concentrated, with no large players buying in. The North Group immediately began selling, and the market price suddenly rose by one or two jiao to five or six jiao. The second round continued to be firm, but the number was small, slightly better by one or two jiao. After the opening in the afternoon, the short squeeze was severe, rising sharply by half a yuan, and the rest also continued to rise in unison. At the closing, the November position was selling extremely well, especially this month's. The market price then became chaotic, and the trend was already mixed, with a difference of about one or two jiao. In summary, the market price results showed a unanimous rise, ranging from one or two jiao to one yuan, entirely due to the short squeeze in the current month. The total number of transactions was estimated at 25 million yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall results is listed on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Reaches New Highs</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Trading House reported that yesterday (April 22) the New York stock market trended upwards. Utilities and Industrials both reached new highs for the year. Trading volume was the highest it had been since February 18, as traders continued to believe that President Roosevelt's proposal to regulate public utilities holding companies would be modified liberally. Nearing the close, the market softened slightly as longs took profits, but the amount of selling was small and the overall trend was very positive. The bond market and smaller exchanges also rose.</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton</h3>
<p>Staple Yarn Prices Have Stabilized After Large Drop</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Bales of Yarn Awaiting Delivery</p>
<p>The yarn market has shown signs of stability after the major drop the previous day. This is because the financial turmoil has been contained as much as possible with the help of the three major banks, and public sentiment has turned from panic to stability, which has temporarily dispelled the speculative atmosphere in the market. New sellers are relatively scarce. However, there is news that 400 bales of 20-count Waking Lion yarn, 350 bales of Double Fish yarn, 150 bales of Red Lotus Bee yarn, 100 bales of Earth yarn, and 50 bales of Golden Pagoda yarn, for a total of 1,050 bales, have been delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<p>First Drop, Then Rise This Month</p>
<p>The staple yarn market opened with a decline in American cotton and an increase in Indian cotton. However, as staple gold prices trended downwards, the market sentiment remained depressed. This month's futures continued to fall by one yuan, but the prices of far-month contracts were relatively firm. Market commentary stated that after the large banks stabilized the native bank's squeeze on positions, public sentiment was more peaceful. As a result, there was a lack of new short positions, and the declining trend subsided slightly. As a result, this month's closing price was down four jiao compared to the previous day, and far-month contracts were up by an average of three or four jiao. The afternoon opening remained level, but Da Ji returned to cover short positions, and the market rebounded slightly. This month's price was up by one yuan compared to the morning closing price, the mid-month price was down by one or two jiao, and the far-month price was up by one or two jiao. It was found that Sui Long sold 2,850 bales, Tong Ji sold 450 bales, Shen Chang sold 1,250 bales, Ren Feng sold 650 bales, Run Kang sold 750 bales, Yong Da sold 1,050 bales, Yu Da sold 650 bales, Yuan Tai sold 450 bales, Heng Chang sold 450 bales, Tong He sold 450 bales, Ji Feng sold 350 bales, and Tai Xing sold 350 bales. Da Fu bought 800 bales, Da Ji bought 1,800 bales, Zhen Da bought 1,000 bales, Geng Feng bought 1,000 bales, Gu Da bought 950 bales, Yuan Tai bought 1,150 bales, Jun Chang bought 750 bales, Chang Yu bought 700 bales, Chang Feng bought 450 bales, and Xin Cheng bought 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and the closing price are as follows:</p>
<p>Staple Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Account Balance</p>
<p>April Futures	181.9	180.3	181.9	Up 0.60	18,400</p>

<p>700 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were good, more than the previous day. It was found that each group bought a total of 709 bales throughout the day. The market was calm. Each</p>

<h3>This Month's Cotton Futures Fluctuations: Prior Market Sell-Off Followed by Later Market Replenishment; Distant Futures Rise in the Morning but Fall in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market this month is gradually showing a weak state. According to market reports, the cotton that has passed inspection by the cotton inspection office has reached about 9,000 bales. As a result, many speculators, seeing sufficient delivery, are settling their excess positions, and the market is becoming slack. However, some industry players are inclined to go long. It is estimated that, overall, the price ratio between cotton and yarn suggests that cotton prices are high.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, the market condition was sluggish, showing a state of standstill. This was because U.S. cotton fell by four to six points, and Indian cotton rose sharply by five rupees. However, the spot price fell sharply, breaking through the 800 yuan mark, reaching a new low, and causing a weary and dispirited sentiment. However, major players are firmly absorbing the volume and not letting go. It is said that there will be 10,000 bales for delivery this month, and scattered long positions are being settled, making the market particularly weak, down 25 cents from the previous day's close. However, distant months rose by five cents to one dime. In the afternoon opening, short-covering activity in the current month caused the price to rebound by two dimes compared to the morning close, but distant months were flat. The unofficial market for Indian cotton fell back by 2.5 rupees. Sales included: Yu Da 4,200 bales, Da Feng 1,400 bales, Sui Long 2,100 bales, Yong Da 2,500 bales, Tong He 3,300 bales, Xin Cheng 1,000 bales, Yi Kang 1,900 bales, Xin Heng 1,000 bales, Yuan Yi 1,300 bales. Purchases included: Tong Ji 4,900 bales, Ji Feng 1,100 bales, Da Ji 6,900 bales, Geng Feng 3,400 bales, Tong Xing 1,400 bales, Sheng Yuan 2,800 bales, Yuan Xing Chang 2,900 bales, Yi Kang 1,500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton     Highest Price    Lowest Price     Closing Price    Change     Account Balance</p>
<p>April            35.10        34.60       34.80      Down 0.05   40,700</p>

<p>Total               727,900</p>
<p>The current cotton sales market feels even more deserted. Mills are not healthy, mainly because yarn prices are not rising.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Cotton  43.60   Yong'an Mill purchase 200 pieces of spot goods delivered to the mill.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 47.25 - 50 Da Kang Mill purchase 200 pieces more and more</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton     41.25   Shenxin Mill purchase 200 bales more and more</p>
<p>Sea Island Cotton       41.75   Shenxin Mill purchase 200 bales more and more</p>
<h3>Recent Foreign Cotton Import Statistics —Over Three Hundred and Forty Thousand Bales—</h3>
<p>Recent foreign cotton imports in Shanghai include 21,300 bales of American cotton, 3,277 bales of Indian cotton, and 860 bales of Egyptian cotton. There were no imports of Burmese, African, or South American cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton First Rises, Then Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, industry players bought in, and prices for all months rose by five to seven points. Subsequently, due to the unstable situation in the textile industry and the government's uncertain policy regarding new cotton, long positions were closed one after another, and market prices gradually declined. In the afternoon, short-covering provided some stability. As a result, spot prices fell by five points, and futures fell by three to seven points. British cotton was closed. Indian cotton rose due to short-covering of old cotton and extensive buying. Prices were: Pingguoer up four to 4.25 rupees, Aomula up five to 5.5 rupees, Bailuoxi up five to 5.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegraph of the 22nd):</p>

<h3>Grains: Relationship Between Wheat Futures and the Exchange Rate—Large Arrivals of Spot Wheat, Market Slightly Smaller—</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally flat and weak. The quoted price for foreign wheat was only slightly better by about four points. At the opening, due to the sharp fall in the gold market, although sellers did not dump heavily, everyone was watching and waiting. As a result, the market showed a weak and lifeless atmosphere. Domestic new wheat will soon enter the market, making it impossible to continue ordering foreign wheat. However, a prolonged extension of foreign exchange is tantamount to a counter-proof that continuous purchases are possible. Perhaps this is why buyers could not be attracted. As a result, the current month was down 0.2 cents, July was down 0.2 cents, August was down 0.4 cents, and September was down 0.2 cents. In the spot wheat market, due to abundant arrivals and mills not being greedy, prices for each grade fell by 0.2-0.3 cents. The opening price for Bengbu wheat was 3.97 yuan, followed by 3.95 yuan; Yingzhou wheat was 3.99 yuan; Luohe wheat was 3.94 yuan, followed by 3.92 yuan; Xinpu wheat was 3.87 yuan, followed by 3.85 yuan; Haizhou wheat was 3.91 yuan; Jiangbei wheat was 3.90 yuan; Pingxi wheat was 3.92 yuan; Hankou wheat was 3.79 yuan, followed by 3.75 yuan. A total of 6,000 bags were handled by Fuxin. There is very little high-grade deliverable wheat in Chicago; most of the hedges have already been moved. The spot wheat situation is firm. The major early-harvest areas still have no rain. It is expected that the supply will decrease by 2.162 million bushels this week.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat           April 18th        April 22nd           Change</p>
<p>May           101.30            102.00            Up 0.50</p>

<h3>Flour Turns Weak After Remaining Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was first steady and then fell. The quoted price for foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada was slightly better by about 0.4 cents. After the opening, as financial rumors had subsided, but the exchange rate rose sharply and gold prices fell sharply, the current month's opening price was low at 0.3 cents, a drop of 0.6 cents from the previous week's high, although spot prices were still rising. This was because actual sales were slightly stagnant due to turnover issues. Distant futures were stable as factories were not selling. The current month rebounded by 0.1 cents due to short-covering. However, at the afternoon opening, the opening prices for all months were initially stable, but then long positions were sold off, and factories also slightly sold, causing all near and distant months to show a weak and declining trend. Observing this situation, if the weather is good and actual sales are stagnant due to financial reasons, the market may be weaker. As a result, the current month fell by 0.75 cents, May fell by 0.1 cent, June fell by 0.75 cents, July fell by 1.25 cents, August fell by 1.75 cents, and September fell by 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Mostly See Small Declines—Undoubtedly Related to Tight Credit—</h3>
<p>The market for foreign Indica rice initially had a trend of continuing to rise, but was affected by changes in the financial world. Importers of foreign Indica rice mostly took a wait-and-see attitude, and the rising trend of foreign Indica rice was immediately thwarted. Yesterday, Japan Street and the Yangtze River regions stopped trading, while inland purchases continued to be active, handling over 20,000 bags of rice and over 1,000 bags of foreign Indica rice. Prices were similar to the previous market, and spot prices remained firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, only the 13th and 14th batches of river rice arrived at various Shanghai South Bank suppliers (totaling nearly 3,000 stones). Sales were also normal, and the situation was quiet. Later, over 500 bags from Qingdao and Yantai suppliers arrived, which tightened the market and brought stability. The supply of regular Shanghai, Suzhou, Tongxiang, Nangang, and other japonica rice varieties, as well as Qingjiao, Songjiang, Xishi, and Lianxi thin rice varieties, was scarce, and prices were unchanged. The prices of Yinyuan and Yangjian rice varieties also did not fluctuate. In the Shanghai North rice market yesterday, the 22nd and 23rd batches of river rice arrived in Shanghai. Sales were slow, and transactions were sluggish. Market prices for white japonica rice were down about 0.1 yuan, and prices for high-quality thin rice were down nearly 0.1 yuan. Prices for medium and low-quality thin rice and early rice were slightly down. The price of Bianyuan rice was down 0.2 yuan. Other varieties also showed a weak trend.</p>
<h3>Inland Sales of Red Sorghum and Corn Continue to Be Strong—Opening Prices All Up 0.05-0.07 Yuan</h3>
<p>The market for red sorghum and corn is gradually becoming strong. Due to continuous inland sales, the market saw a sudden increase in buying interest yesterday, so sellers were hoarding, and prices rose. Overall, the market sold 600 bags of Guide red sorghum, four truckloads of Bengbu red sorghum, and 240 bags of Tianjin corn, all of which were purchased for inland sales. Corn prices were up 0.05 yuan, and red sorghum prices were up 0.06-0.07 yuan compared to the previous market. The bean market is still fluctuating. Although factories have demand, they seem to be losing steam. Inland trade in this area is also difficult to develop due to financial depletion and a somewhat discouraged sentiment, making it difficult for selling prices to rise. Overall, the market sold 1,000 bags of Guide beans, one truckload of Feihe beans, 200 bags of Yingzhou beans, one truckload of Quanhe beans, 200 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 147 bags of Gou beans, 300 bags of Chi beans, and 100 bags of Chongming sandy yellow beans. Truckloads of beans were still purchased by factories. Prices were similar to before. The futures price of beans was slightly down by 0.03 yuan in the current month but still up by 0.02 yuan in May. The market had no unique characteristics.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Transactions Are Also Quite Scarce</h3>
<p>The sugar market is seeing loose customs gold and extremely tight credit, resulting in scarce transactions and a softening trend. The association set the market price for 24 groups of granulated white sugar at 17.40 yuan, and the re-export price was down 0.05 yuan to 5.70 yuan, but no transactions were made. The quoted price for Zhenyu No. 1 refined white sugar from local factories was 16.80 yuan. Only a few dozen bags of Hainan red sugar were offered by the Chaozhou group at a price of 10.06 yuan, unchanged from before. A hundred or so pieces of large-bag tribute ice sugar arrived from the Taiyuan freighter for the Jian group yesterday. Samples will be available today, and the market outlook is stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: News of Keemun New Tea</h3>
<p>Keemun black tea has become increasingly popular recently. The number of tea production workshops has increased to 240. Among them, 30 production and sales cooperatives funded by the Chinese Farmers Bank have completed their general vote and unanimously passed the confidence motion, entrusting all sales to Qianji Tea Shop in Shanghai. Tea farmers also started picking on the 20th. Due to the weather being neither cold nor warm, with sunny days and rainy nights, the quality of the tea is much better than in previous years, with a production volume of around 50,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Sees New Low Price Again</h3>
<p>There has been renewed interest in European sales of Luzhuang chouxin Zhenmei green tea recently. Yesterday, Zhongxinchang, Shengchang, and Shengchang tea shops, together with Tongfu, Hua Tea, and other firms, reached an agreement on Wuyuan high-grade goods, totaling over 120 boxes. The market price opened at 78 yuan. This price is 60% lower than the opening price last year, the lowest price in recent years.</p>
<h3>Metals: Union Steel Inventory Is Thin</h3>
<p>The new bottom inventory of 200-pound Union Steel is very thin, and the outlets are actively collecting and handling by guest gangs and factories. The market situation is very active, and the market conditions for standard quality are extremely good. The estimated price for old steel mill goods is 29.50 yuan, and the estimated price for new steel mill goods is 28.75 yuan. A type of chicken goods can also be opened up to 27.50 yuan. It is reported that a total of two or three hundred boxes were opened in the past two days, and the market sentiment is extremely good. The market prospects for tomorrow are very solid.</p>

<h3>The Life and Works of D.H. Lawrence</h3>
<p>— Ren Baitao</p>
<p>D.H. Lawrence was born on September 11, 1885, in Nottinghamshire. His father was a coal miner. Lawrence was the fourth among his siblings. At the age of thirteen, he won a scholarship to Nottingham High School. At the age of sixteen, he left school and worked in a surgical instrument manufacturing factory. But at the age of eighteen, he entered Nottingham University to obtain a teacher's certificate. At this university, he met the famous linguist Professor E. Weekly and began writing his debut work, "The White Peacock." His mother suffered from cancer and died in 1910. He wanted his mother to see "The White Peacock" before she died, so he specially printed a copy, but his mother never saw it. After studying at Nottingham University for two years, he obtained a teacher's certificate and took a teaching position at the David Road School in Croydon, near London. During this teaching period, he wrote many essays, short stories, and poems. It was not his mother but his lover—the girl who was "Miriam" in "Son and Lovers"—who encouraged him to write. She herself sent five of his poems to the magazine "English Review," which was in 1909. After being published by F.M. Huefier, the editor of this magazine, Lawrence officially entered the British literary scene. This was the person who introduced "The White Peacock" to be published by Hanniel Society (1911). During this time, he also published several essays and essays in Heffa's magazine. After two years, he resigned from his teaching position and devoted himself to writing. Not long after leaving the school in Croydon, he was hired as a lecturer by a German university, but he declined. But soon he went to Germany and served in Bavaria for six months, then went to Lake Garda in Italy. During this time, his second novel, "The Trespasser," was published (1912).</p>
<p>In February 1913, his first collection of poems, "Love Poems and Others," was published. Two months later, his masterpiece "Sons and Lovers" was also published. At this time, he lived in the capital of Bavaria. He returned to England in June and stayed temporarily on the coast of Kent. He went to Bavaria again in August. He went to Italy in September. In the Gulf of Spezia, he lived there until June of the following year.</p>
<p>In July 1914, he returned to England and married Frieda, the daughter of a German baron von Richthofen. But Frida was originally the daughter of Professor Weekly, his old teacher during his university days, eight years older than him, and had already had three children. Details of this romance are written in "The Savage Pilgrimage," a memoir of Lawrence by his female disciple C. Carswell. Also in this year, his first collection of short stories, "The Prussian Officer," was published. In December, the two lived in Casersham, Buckinghamshire, northwest of London. In January of the following year, they moved to Pulborough in Sussex on the south coast.</p>
<p>In August 1915, he moved to the outskirts of London. In September, "The Rainbow" was published. This novel was banned from distribution in name because it harmed public morals, but in fact, it contained anti-war elements, which offended the authorities' taboos. The ban on the sale of "The Rainbow" was a severe blow to Lawrence. Regarding this incident, only M. Sinclair and A. Bennelt did some sympathetic advocacy in the literary world, and no one else helped him. The persecution he suffered during the war was more than this: just because his wife was German, he lived on the coast of Cornwall and was suspected by the local authorities of colluding with the enemy, who searched his home. How he suffered during the war can be understood by reading the chapter "The Nightmare" in "Kangaroo." Poverty and other oppressions, repeated distribution bans, and illness—his life was a history of bitter struggle.</p>
<p>His Cornwall period was from December 1915 to October 1917. During this period, he published the essays "Twilight in Italy" and the poetry collection "Amores." From October 1917 to January of the following year, he lived in London, then moved to Newbruy in Burke County, and in May came to Middleton in Derby County. In November 1919, after the end of the war, he crossed to Italy: he lived in Florence until December, then went to the island of Capri; in March of the following year, he moved to Taormina on the east coast of Sicily. In April 1921, he left this place and entered Germany via Italy, residing in Baden. During this time, his fourth novel, "Women in Love," was published by Seka Society in London (1921); but this novel had already been published in a limited edition by pre-order in New York (1920). The couple then returned from Baden to Sicily. That winter, Lawrence traveled to Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea; his harvest was the publication of "Sea and Sardinia" (New York 1921; London 1923).</p>
<p>In 1922, Lawrence and his wife went to India and stayed in Ceylon for two months. Then he crossed to Australia, for about three months. The publication of "Aaron's Rod" was at that time. In August 1922, the couple left Australia, and via New York and the South Pacific Islands, arrived in San Francisco in September. From there, he went to Taos, New Mexico; then to Mexico.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1923, Lawrence roamed Quan Guan and returned to Mexico. In August 1923, his wife returned to England, and he returned in November. After returning to China, he lived there until the end of January of the following year, and the two went to Baden and Paris again, and then returned to London; but in March, they took a ship to the United States again: this time, they sailed directly to New Mexico. He lived in New Mexico until October 1924, and then went to Oaxaca in southern Mexico. There he collected most of the material for "Mornings in Mexico" and completed "The Plumed Serpent" (1926); the short stories later collected in "The Woman Who Rode Away" were also written at that time.</p>
<p>Lawrence returned to England in October 1925; but immediately went to Frida's mother's home in Baden; then to Spotorno, where he lived until March 1926. During this time, "The Plumed Serpent" was published.</p>
<p>The couple moved from Spotorno to Florence and rented a villa outside the city. Here, Lawrence began to write his last novel, "Lady Chatterley's Lover." This novel was rewritten three times, and the first edition was a signed limited private edition printed by G. Orioli in Florence (1928). Apart from short trips to Germany, England, and Switzerland, the couple lived in the villa in Florence until May 1928.</p>
<p>From March to November 1928, his whereabouts were Switzerland, Germany, and southern France, and finally settled in Bandol, where he lived until 1929.</p>
<p>They then traveled to Paris and Florence. In April 1929, they lived in the Balearic Islands near the Mediterranean Sea in Spain for more than a month. It was during this time that he decided to open a painting exhibition in London. But this exhibition was interfered with by the London authorities and failed to open. Later, those works were moved to Vence in southern France. In the summer of the same year, he traveled to Germany; his collection of poems "Pansies" was published during this time.</p>
<p>In February 1930, he moved to the mountains of Vence. Died of illness on March 2. He suffered from bronchitis and wheezing, and was confined to a room on rainy days. His British friends received a notice that he was ill and thought it was nothing serious, but he unexpectedly died a few days later. Therefore, there were only forty or so people who attended the funeral. Before his grave, only the "Phoenix"—which he had long chosen as his own pattern—made of small stones collected by a farmer who loved him, stood there like something symbolizing.</p>
<h3>Curiosities Gathered</h3>
<p>— Wo Pu</p>
<p>"Record of the West Tower"</p>
<p>Li Diaoyuan's "Yucun Quhua" Volume II has the following:</p>
<p>"The most taboo in composing music is to go beyond reason and emotion; Wang Shungeng's 'Record of the West Tower', when matchmaking fails, he lets out an old (note: should be 胥) Gong, kills an innocent concubine, and steals someone's concubine as a friend's wife. The structure has reached this point, which can be said to be falling into a sea of misery. Shungeng, a native of Gaoyou."</p>
<p>The next item says:</p>
<p>"West Tower is good at adjusting rhythms. The white words in the sixth scene "Private Contract" say: "I have seen the glorious mansion of Jin Fan, and I praise his great name day and night." This is Shungeng's self-satisfaction. Therefore, it is said: "To children, the ancient melodies of Yangchun, few harmonize."</p>
<p>Li's claims that Wang Shungeng of Gaoyou wrote the "Record of the West Tower." These two records make a double mistake. Li did not even know who Yuan Ziling was at the time, which is strange—the reason why he "entangled" Wang Shungeng was probably because of the confusion caused by the loose song collection "West Tower Music House". The differences between loose songs and dramas were originally very confused and indistinguishable. Probably, Li happened to not know who the author of the "Record of the West Tower" was, so he confusedly linked it with Wang Shungeng. But at the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were indeed two people named West Tower; one was Wang Pan, named Hongjian, from Gaoyou. One was Wang Tian, named Shungeng, from Jinan. Both Wangs were Sanqu writers with great reputation. People who talked about music in the Ming Dynasty could not distinguish them very clearly, and they often referred to them interchangeably. The existing "West Tower Music House" was written by Wang Hongjian. (See Ren Erbei's "Anthology of Loose Songs" and "Quxie") The Gaoyou Wang Shungeng mentioned by Li has also made mistakes in his place of origin and writings. This does not seem to be able to be simply blamed on him.</p>
<p>In the past, books discussing music, apart from "Yucun Quhua", also included Liang Tingnan's "Teng Hua Ting Quhua", Yang Enshou's "Ciyu Conghua", all of which often made this kind of mistake of "talking according to conjecture". If we want to base their records as "essentials", especially for more obscure materials, we probably cannot but pay special attention to selection, identification and review.</p>
<h3>Dance Marathon (3)</h3>
<p>— (By American L.T. Farrell, Translated by Yi Xian)</p>
<p>Then, hard times came to America. Tax lost his job in winter, and his savings were gone again. He was hired by a candy store, working twelve hours a day, ten dollars a week, but after ten months, he lost that job too. He entered a large restaurant, doing dishwashing work, seven dollars a week, and later his wages were reduced to five dollars. Every night, with stiff hands and aching back, he walked home tiredly. He had no money to go to dance halls anymore. Later, he lost even this dishwashing job.</p>
<p>He walked the streets, looking for other work, and all he heard was the same story—hard times. He ate very sparingly, lived in a single, cold room with many rats, and wished he could return to his hometown in the Greek mountains. He went out every day looking for work. Sometimes he found short-term jobs, getting by for a few days or weeks, then struggling to find work again. One day, he saw an advertisement with large letters—Dance Marathon. After some investigation, he learned that it was a competition where participants had to dance as hard as they could, and whoever danced the longest would be the winner, with a prize of five hundred dollars. Maybe he would win the championship in this competition. Then, he could get a position in the movie industry and become the dream lover of American girls. Otherwise, he could perform at a cabaret or sign a dance contract with some tavern. Moreover, during the competition, he would be taken care of, having food to eat and not having to pay rent. He was strong and knew how to dance. He was used to standing on his feet all day long in restaurants, candy stores, and taverns. This was truly his chance to make a fortune. He wouldn't have to run around listening to people say they weren't hiring because of the hard times. This was much better than saving up money to open a candy store himself, like those Greek-Americans who had employed him, gradually becoming rich. If he won this competition and became famous, he could return to Athens with suitcases full of clothes and foreign money, perhaps even with a rich American wife with milk-like skin.</p>
<p>Tax joined the "Dance Marathon." He was given a number to wear on his back and assigned a dance partner named Mary Green, a beautiful blue-eyed girl who was exactly the type he had always dreamed of marrying. At first, when this girl met him, she couldn't help but feel a shock and show a disgusted expression on her face. However, she quickly realized that he was a strong, broad-shouldered man, and she smiled charmingly, offering him a soft hand and saying sweetly that she knew they would definitely win the championship.</p>
<h3>An Evening Call</h3>
<p>— Shi Ye</p>
<p>Speaking of this story, it has been a long time ago, but even now, I often think about it and cannot forget...</p>
<p>It was an autumn evening two years ago. I brought the news of my late wife's death to a relative named Yao, to inform them that my wife, who had been ill for a year and a half, had finally passed away, leaving behind only a four-year-old child and myself.</p>
<p>The Yao family lived in a spacious single-family house. Because there were many people, they even borrowed the adjacent downstairs guest room, with a door connecting them. When I entered, the guest room was silent. Only a doctor sat at a mahogany table, writing a prescription with a brush, making rustling sounds. Yao's father, over sixty years old, with white hair and beard, sat opposite the doctor, his face furrowed; Yao's mother, of the same age, had become somewhat slow-witted after a fire scare, her head lowered, sitting blankly in a corner. The gloomy autumn twilight was gradually enveloping the guest room, which was filled with a sense of sorrow and desolation.</p>
<p>Because I hadn't visited for a long time, the two elders stood up to welcome me, showing a little smile on their faces. They immediately noticed the black gauze on my arm and asked in surprise who had passed away. I replied that it was my wife.</p>
<p>"Oh, what a pity. What illness was it?" the two elders asked in unison.</p>
<p>"Lung disease. It started after January 28th."</p>
<p>"When did she pass away?"</p>
<p>"A week ago."</p>
<p>The two elders listened silently. On their faces, there was a look of sympathy and regret, but also of pain. At that moment, the doctor had finished writing the prescription, and as he stood up, he said, "Try taking two doses of this."</p>
<p>"Is it Xiujie who is sick again?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, her illness flares up every now and then. This time it's quite severe. We've already consulted three or four doctors," Yao's mother replied sadly.</p>
<p>From the downstairs guest room next door, which served as a bedroom, came two or three soft coughs. The guest room where I was sitting became as quiet as if water had been poured on it. The two elders' eyes became moist, and the doctor stared at the black gauze on my arm.</p>
<p>Finally, the doctor left, leaving only the two elderly people and myself, who had lost his wife. The sky grew darker.</p>
<p>I had wanted to go to the next room to check on Xiujie's condition, but I thought that Xiujie's illness was also lung disease, and it was said that there was some karmic connection with my late wife according to superstition, so I didn't get up after all. A faint sadness welled up in my heart, and I looked at the two elders, thinking of that unbelievable karmic connection.</p>
<p>It turned out that five years before, on the day I married my late wife, Xiujie had helped along with her other sisters. Xiujie was the one who dressed the bride. However, because of a small quarrel during the wedding, my late wife, who had a fiery temper, got angry while being dressed and knocked into Xiujie with her hand, and the wooden comb also fell to the ground. According to superstition, this was unlucky for the person helping with the bride's attire. Afterwards, Xiujie, who was physically weak, became ill. According to Yao's mother privately, the initial cause was that the bride had knocked her with her hand. Other older people also said the same. From then on, I felt a faint sense of guilt and fear of unspoken blame, and I rarely went to their house.</p>
<p>Now, unexpectedly, Xiujie had been ill for several years, and my late wife, who had been healthy, had also contracted lung disease and passed away first. Thinking of this, I felt an indescribable grief.</p>
<p>I woke up from my thoughts and looked up to see a photo of Xiujie hanging on the wall, taken after she became ill. Her delicate face had a kind of lingering sorrow. Her eyes were gentle but contained a hint of sadness. From the next room, I heard the light, clear sound of coughing again.</p>
<p>That evening, the two elders earnestly urged me to stay for dinner, but I felt as if I were burdened with a heavy crime and didn't dare to sit for long. I excused myself, saying I had other business, and hurriedly left, only leaving a word of regards for Xiujie, leaving the two elders alone in the lonely autumn evening, taking care of their young daughter, because on that day, her sisters-in-law were not at home.</p>
<p>This young woman, who was still unmarried, also passed away last spring. On the way to the funeral, I silently prayed for the reconciliation and peace of the two deceased.</p>
<p>"You two are both people I loved and respected, and unfortunately, you both died young. If dying young is fortunate, then you have been fortunate.</p>
<p>"You two, please reconcile in another world, because death is reconciliation."</p>
<h3>Pastoral in the Mountains (3)</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>When he realized that they would be traveling together tomorrow and the day after, he softened his expression and made a show of carefully listening to what the other party was saying. However, he wouldn't lower himself too much, always looking for opportunities to hint vaguely about how he had once done big business.</p>
<p>"Three strings and two hundred cash? Hah, my shop used to pay only two strings and four hundred cash! This..."</p>
<p>Or, when talking about how smuggling opium could make a lot of money, he would shake his head and say:</p>
<p>"We don't do that kind of business... That's simply harming people! To be honest, we look down on money earned that way. Trading foreign cloth and yarn is the right way to go, I'm telling you, brother."</p>
<p>Because, hearing this kind of thing, Lao Xu, who did a little bit of small business, couldn't help but feel respect, and when the shop owner brought the food, he treated him with the face of a peddler treating a good customer, squinting his eyes surrounded by wrinkles and politely inviting him:</p>
<p>"Boss Qin, please take a seat! Please take a seat!"</p>
<p>"Don't be so polite!"</p>
<p>Even though he said that, Boss Qin didn't give way to the other party and went ahead and sat down. Lao Chen, who was in the business of selling smuggled cigarettes, had long felt extremely unhappy, and now he could only bury his head in his food. When Boss Qin left, Lao Chen knocked his chopsticks on his bowl and said to Lao Xu:</p>
<p>"Damn it, is selling foreign goods more noble? That's ridiculous!... In the end, in one sentence, they are slaves of foreigners!"</p>
<p>But the next morning, the man called Boss Qin actually argued with the shop owner over not wanting to exchange a broken copper coin to pay for the shop, and Lao Chen also canceled his opinion that he was some kind of boss, lightly leaning his elbow on Lao Xu and whispering:</p>
<p>"Look, would someone who has been a big boss be like this? You actually believed him!"</p>
<p>So, on the road, everyone was encouraging Lao Xu to oppose Boss Qin.</p>
<p>After someone on a trip has expressed his unhappiness, if he can sing a little, he will sing whatever comes to mind. Now, Lao Chen was exactly in this situation, so he began to sing mountain songs, starting with his own male voice, with a teasing tone.</p>
<p>"Three elder sisters-in-law cross the west river,</p>
<p>The one in the middle is my wife!</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Banning Polygamy and Trafficking of Women and Children</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>A dispatch from Eastman Port on the 21st, carrying a message about the "International Women's Movement," stated: "The International Women's Rights Conference recently held here passed a resolution stipulating that there should be no distinction between East and West in prohibiting the trafficking of white women and banning polygamy, and that there should be no discrimination in the treatment of women based on their nationality or religion." In many parts of our country, the trafficking of women is not only widespread but also reduced in price to two or three dollars or valued by age (one dollar per year). At the same time, after the abolition of the "concubine system," the "family relationship" of "cohabitation" between men and women is very prevalent. This resolution is worth discussing.</p>
<p>I am not a woman, so I cannot experience what it is like to be reduced to "commodities" and fall into the life of a "concubine." However, history and reality have recorded for me that some are called "cattle and horses," and others are called "toys." Generally speaking, they are not treated as "people." Creatures with all five senses and round heads and square feet cannot receive the same treatment as their male counterparts. This is indeed a "miracle" of "human society." This "miracle" exists among birds, beasts, snakes, and insects and seems worthy of special attention from our biologists. However, it occurs among us, who have reached the twentieth century and even call ourselves "civilized," and is regarded as a matter of course, ignored by familiar eyes. It's truly "God knows!"</p>
<p>This "God knows" matter, if it were practiced in the era of "the husband being the guide of the wife," it would be fine. However, now we constantly talk about "respecting women's rights" and "gender equality," which makes it difficult for us to justify ourselves. The gentlemen of the International Women's Rights Conference have raised their voices to prohibit and eliminate this. Without a doubt, I raise both hands to express my support. However, I doubt whether this "resolution" alone can successfully eliminate the phenomenon of trafficking women and the bad habit of polygamy.</p>
<p>The existence of social inequality, where some people eat others and some people plunder others, leads to the occurrence of trafficking women. Only in such an environment will some people be willing to sell women, and only some people will have the right and possibility to buy women. Brokers of trafficking women only play a side effect in the process and are "produced by market needs." However, the gentlemen of the women's rights movement, setting aside the root of the problem, seize the accomplices as the main culprits and try to prohibit them. I have not seen that this will be effective.</p>
<h3>Noble People</h3>
<p>— Jing Fu</p>
<p>People who pass through Chen Jia Zhuang often sigh with admiration: "Oh, that's the house of Master Chen the Second!" After many years of wind and rain, this elegant and grand building is still so majestic and strong. Master Chen the Second is the first wealthy man in Chen Jia Zhuang, a truly noble person! Everyone still remembers the former prestige of the noble Master Chen the Second.</p>
<p>However, since Master Chen the Second returned to his hometown for the fifth time, things have changed.</p>
<p>Now, in front of Master Chen the Second's mansion, which still makes people yearn for it at first glance, many children are running around every day, often encountering a terrifying person.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The children like to tease him and even play pranks on him. This terrifying person is the formerly intimidating and noble Master Chen the Second. In the past, the children were so amazed, admired, and fearful of him. He brought back a lot of money from Southeast Asia and became a truly noble person. However, his last glorious return home also brought leprosy. Leprosy, what a terrifying term!</p>
<p>Master Chen the Second's noble sons, daughters-in-law, and wives are not in this mansion accompanying him. They are all in Southeast Asia guarding the mutually rich property. Only two servants cover their noses and snicker when they see him, considering it service to him. The deep and tall mansion is too empty. Master Chen the Second often pulls on his cane, swaying his swollen body and festering face, appearing in front of the mansion. Although the children are annoying, they are better than lying dead in the house, more lively and energetic.</p>
<p>As soon as the swollen body appears at the door, the children cover their noses, point at him, and shout: "Oh, oh, leper... leper..." The children are afraid of this leper whose whole body is rotting but also like to approach him to joke and have fun. If he tries to sway back inside, they hurry up and block the door: "Leper, leper, don't go..." They giggle and clap, and some even throw twigs and pebbles at him, clapping their hands and shouting for joy.</p>
<p>On his hands, feet, and face, there are sores, yellow pus, slightly red wounds, and poisonous juices about to drip. Flies buzz around, constantly bothering Master Chen the Second. Master Chen the Second can only twist his flesh, showing his pain. Passersby often point and say: What a terrifying beggar! No one thinks that this is the once authoritative and noble person!</p>
<p>Yes! Master Chen the Second is a wealthy man from Southeast Asia. However, his meanness and stinginess are also well known. Many people who have suffered from him never expected this to be his end. Wealthy people love their money, but they also love all kinds of entertainment. Master Chen the Second is completely dissolute, but even more stingy with his money. So, he strongly disapproves of those who go to brothels and prostitutes. That's really foolish! Master Chen the Second came up with a method. He bought female servants, who could provide the same service as prostitutes every night and also work for him. This was the most cost-effective. As a result, Master Chen the Second contracted incurable leprosy from this "double-duty" female servant because of his greed for small advantages. Lepers are not tolerated by people and are expelled by foreigners. Finally, he lives alone in the noble mansion in loneliness. When he returned, everyone exclaimed: "How did Master Chen the Second become like this... Such a noble person!" But afterwards, people would mock the terrifying Master Chen to his face: "Miserliness leads to ruin, oh, you are very noble... but now...? So stingy..." At the same time, they would spit and walk away laughing.</p>
<p>"This is the most noble rich man! This is a despicable leper..."</p>
<h3>Before and After Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Chong Lin</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>As the ship entered Wusong Port, we began to see the fields, vegetation, and tiled roofs of China. I was very surprised. The impressions of the fields, vegetation, and tiled roofs of Europe were still clear in my mind. Suddenly, I felt that the scenery of China was so weak, withered, and small. Even the hairless deserts of Africa were more vibrant and energetic.</p>
<p>The sky was drizzling, with three flakes of snow, gloomy, just like the weather when we left Lyon. The ship was supposed to dock at ten in the morning, but there were big storms on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai, delaying the arrival time. The sky gradually darkened. In the sea breeze with snow, we stood shivering, standing, standing from two in the afternoon, it was already past five in the afternoon, waiting for Shanghai to come closer to our eyes.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I left Shanghai with heavy wounds and humiliation. A few years ago, I also left Shanghai with the good intentions and high hopes of friends. How would I see it again? As I stepped on the shore of Shanghai, I understood: I was finally misunderstood, and a hidden malice was probing for opportunities to prepare to slander me again.</p>
<p>After a period of chaos, squeezing, and waiting at customs, we parted from our companion Mr. Wang and saw our relatives and friends. We had seen them long ago when the ship docked. An unspeakable joy made us intoxicated with tears. However, these joyful tears immediately turned into sad tears for me. I realized at this time that I was already an orphan who had lost his loving mother, a truly pitiful person.</p>
<p>Walking on the streets of Shanghai, the first things I found annoying and unaccustomed to, like in Hong Kong, were the advertisements, followed by the fashionable Shanghai women. Most of them had permed hair, which was scattered and fluffy like the head of a Western doll that had not been styled. Their clothing already knew how to make the waist thin and show the hips, but they still didn't know how to lift the chest. One lady said to me:</p>
<p>"The book 'Little Women' is very popular. We all love to read it. It can be said to be the best book in recent years."</p>
<p>This is a confession of a new woman. What do the ladies, misses, and gentlemen engaged in women's movement think?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, I felt that life was not at all like it was in Europe, full of work and other things. In Shanghai, days seemed to pass especially quickly. One afternoon, you could only see one friend, and you didn't sit for long in that friend's house. Later, I accidentally stood by the window of the hostel's service counter and discovered the reason for this. Walking on the streets of Shanghai, I felt very uncomfortable. It was as if there were walls blocking me in front and behind. These walls built for pedestrians are indeed a characteristic of Shanghai's Chinese commercial port. Among them, there are few people who are seriously doing things, and most are loitering on the road, stepping ants to death. They look around, talking and cursing. It is impossible to quickly reach your destination if you have urgent business. Your time is spent on these things. For example, to visit a friend, the road originally only takes half an hour, but you are blocked by these people, so it takes an hour. Another characteristic of Shanghai is the noise of people. Like in European cities, at the subway entrances when workers, shop assistants, and clerks go to work, the crowds are so dense that you only see a wave-like motion, but it is quiet and not as noisy as a small street in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I have also returned to this hometown that I left in my childhood. Everything is fresh to me, as if I am seeing it for the first time. Most of the surrounding neighbors and relatives, old ones, have died, and I don't know the young ones. It is indeed a bit like "children meet but do not recognize each other, asking with a smile where the guest has come from." In our room with square brick floors, from the glass window in the sitting room, we can see a narrow river. The other bank of the river is the so-called Hebei. The thatched huts of the Hebei people are still vaguely like ancient paintings. Several rice stacks are piled in the yard in front of our house. Outside the bamboo fence, at this time, the entire field is full of tender cabbage hearts, newly sprouted broad bean seedlings, and green dogwood grass.</p>
<p>Returning home, I felt that the most special and fresh things were the popularity of rubber overshoes and cigarettes. On rainy days, when walking on the muddy road to the town, the farmers with bamboo skirts all wore rubber overshoes. Even the ladies and young mistresses who chanted scriptures, ate vegetarian food, and spun thread to weave their own cloth – who did not smoke when I left the country before – now all have a cigarette in their mouths, taking a puff and exhaling a long breath, as if they couldn't wait to suck the ashes into their stomachs. One young mistress told me about the goodness of Japanese goods:</p>
<p>"It's really not easy to get people to use domestic products. Like spun silk is expensive and not good-looking. Japanese silk materials are cheap and good-looking."</p>
<p>Eight out of ten middle-aged and elderly men in the villages are opium smokers. Opium ghosts, this is another special product of our rice-producing hometown. Not long after I got home, because it was a season for advocating opium abstinence, everyone who smoked opium was discussing everything about opium abstinence.</p>
<p>They all admitted that opium addiction was more painful than having a fever. Several of them had already quit and relapsed.</p>
<p>"It's really too easy to relapse after quitting!" one said.</p>
<p>"Forced opium abstinence is not as good as banning opium altogether!" another said.</p>
<p>The shadows of the entire of China are reflected on the faces of these gaunt opium addicts.</p>
<h3>Hong Ci Nunnery</h3>
<p>— Yong Hui</p>
<p>The sound of the Buddha's name from Songshan Temple drifted from the dense forest opposite; the sound was aged and melancholic—a moaning from the heart of life!</p>
<p>The sound of the wooden fish from Hong Ci Nunnery echoed in harmony with the chanting. In the ancient nunnery, the lime on the walls was peeling off; the two small doors seemed to be worm-eaten: a piece of paint had fallen off on the east side, and there was a hole on the west…</p>
<p>The sound of the chime followed the sound of the wooden fish, seeping out of the moldy Buddhist hall along with wisps of incense smoke: the old nun's chanting sounded rusty, so weak and intermittent. Besides the old nun's voice, there was also a young nun chanting shrilly in harmony.</p>
<p>By the time the chanting was finished, it was already dusk.</p>
<p>"Alas! Is this compassion? Is this the compassion of a renunciate? It's truly living a life of suffering!" she sighed to herself while preparing the vegetarian meal: "Master is almost in the grave! And me? I'm only eighteen! If I go on like this, when will being a nun ever end…"</p>
<p>"Master tells me about the wonders of the Western Paradise, but in reality, if one suffers while alive, who cares about the benefits after death…"</p>
<p>In the gray-black hours before dawn, the young nun habitually got out of bed; she unconsciously and habitually draped a robe covered in dust over her body, not daring to linger in bed for even a moment, lest she violate the old nun's strict orders.</p>
<p>The light of the eternal lamp and the sound of the chime stirred her memories: it was as if she saw her distant hometown, shrouded in clouds and mist for over a year, and her parents, wandering and displaced; although her hometown had been destroyed by years of war and drought! And her parents' whereabouts were unknown due to the turmoil: this only made her yearn more for the beautiful dreams of the past! Recalling the finery she once possessed before becoming a nun.</p>
<p>Although she had been in the nunnery for more than a year, her youthful beauty had not been buried by the worn robe and the desolate years.</p>
<p>When a flame of hope burned within her heart: she could no longer restrain herself! The stern Arhat could not suppress the young person's desire for life, and the iron chains of rigid ethical doctrines could not lock up the vibrant young heart! She could not let her tears spin endlessly with the Buddhist beads in her hands, nor could she let her youth fade away with the lonely time! On a snowy midnight, she mustered her courage, abandoned the harsh old nun, and embarked on the boundless journey of life, beginning to pursue her new life.</p>
<h3>Night Anchorage at West Market</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>In the fading twilight, the boat slowly pulled into the South Embankment of West Market. The boatman tied the mooring rope, exhaled a stuffy breath, and busily jumped into the stern to make a fire and cook.</p>
<p>West Market is a small market town along the Mei River, located in the center between Song City and the county seat; the water journey from Song City would take two days, and West Market was exactly halfway; anchoring here for the night, he could reach the county seat in another day.</p>
<p>The depressed feeling of being cramped in the cabin all day also became as relaxed as the boatman putting down the bamboo pole on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Night greedily flowed down from the silent mountains; the river was a blur, with smoke and water indistinguishable. A row of dense tree shadows stretched along the embankment, covering the quiet, desolate market; the dark shadows of several boats floated sullenly under the embankment in front, the dim yellow lights of the boats reflected in the water, sifting into a swaying, soft fire snake. Under the black umbrella of night, West Market clearly lost its past bustle and prosperity.</p>
<p>Just as dinner was being prepared, someone on the embankment suddenly asked.</p>
<p>"Is that the boat of ××?"</p>
<p>The boat owner frowned, and hurriedly answered; just as he was about to step out, a lantern painted with red and black characters appeared at the bow, the dim yellow light revealed two guards with guns, and a middle-aged man dressed as a civil servant.</p>
<p>"Arriving so late, your——"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, just arrived, sit in the cabin."</p>
<p>"No, no, your protection fee——"</p>
<p>"Ah, good, good…"</p>
<p>The boat owner answered while reaching into his belly pocket, fumbling for a while and then looking up at the civil servant-dressed man, with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Alas, it's really difficult, sir, you understand, things aren't like they used to be, I, I was thinking of paying half…"</p>
<p>"Tsk! You people are really——"</p>
<p>"No, it's not that I'm deliberately being difficult, it's just that…"</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, I'm handling official business, and it's all for the benefit of you boatmen, protecting you, it's not just for that one thing! You think, if you can pay half, everyone else will do the same, what will those dozens of brothers eat?"</p>
<p>After haggling for a while, the boat owner's hand was still in his belly pocket, which was a pity for the other side.</p>
<p>"Pay or not? Give me an answer! Who has time to dawdle with you!"</p>
<p>In the end, the power of the gun was terrifying, and ten shiny silver coins jumped from the boat owner's belly pocket into the other side's black leather bag.</p>
<p>"Protection, protection, protect your mother's ×! Always being ruthless on our heads! When the bandits' guns fire, you run and hide in your mother's ×!"</p>
<p>The boat owner who stepped back into the cabin had a flushed face.</p>

<p>Few people pass under Mount Emei. Bitter rain and howling winds buffet the face. The emperor's romantic feelings are endless. Imperial tears fall like rain for the jade beauty. Last month, the Mawei incident was too tragic. The six armies suddenly changed their minds. Could it be that the three stars cannot shine on the virtuous concubine? That fate should befall Yang Guifei. Now, recalling the Palace of Eternal Life. The shadows and fragrance of robes during the Double Seventh Festival. Wishing to live together under the same covers and die in the same tomb. But now, where has her fragrant soul and vibrant spirit gone? The green phoenix and blue luan are separated in two places. Teaching the song "Rainbow Skirt Feather Dress" to the imperial musicians. Henceforth, there will be no one who understands the music. Who will play "Pure Serenity" with me in the Chenxiang Pavilion? Chen Yuanli. So heartless. Deceiving me with outward obedience and inward defiance. Leading to An Lushan's rebellion in Fanyang City. From now on, it will be difficult to meet again. To see the virtuous concubine, I can only see the white silk. Summon the strongman, open the chest and bring me the white silk. Seeing the silk is like seeing the concubine's face. Oh, Concubine. It's not that I value the empire more than beauty. Gao Lishi, inform the emperor. Consort Yang is already dead, how can she live again. Please whip the horses and chase along the treacherous mountain path. The sound of bells at Jianmen Pass almost breaks my heart. The cuckoo calls in the wind and rain in the middle of the night.</p>

<h3>Gary Cooper's Reasons for Movie Stars Fearing to Meet Journalists (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ren Qin</p>
<p>Generally speaking, movie stars owe a great deal to film magazines and journalists for their success. If they didn't have so many magazines and journalists promoting them, nine out of ten times doing their duties for the reader's interests, their names would hardly be imprinted in the minds of the general public. Therefore, logically speaking, movie stars are usually very polite and respectful to journalists. However, some refuse to meet journalists, and some have to meet journalists but regard it as a difficult task. Gary Cooper is one such example.</p>
<p>It's not that Gary Cooper doesn't know the value of journalists and their publicity work, but he fears meeting them. He has many reasons. Now, to avoid misunderstandings, he has issued a statement. In it, he explains very thoroughly the reasons why movie stars in general fear meeting journalists. We will now translate it as a lesson for journalists, what do you think? The following is Gary Cooper's statement.</p>
<p>When we film actors show a little promise, many reporters from film magazines come to interview us. At that point, these magazines and writers are of great help to the fame of film professionals. Simply put, they create the star's fame. They first write a brief history of us, then how we entered the film industry, how we got good opportunities, and so on. After this material has been repeatedly used, they begin to write about our daily lives and other matters.</p>
<p>It is at this point that film actors begin to fear these journalists. They gradually begin to involve themselves in our personal private lives. They publish things we don't want published. They speculate non-consensually about things that are not the public's business and publish them to the masses. In the end, we have to adopt a strategy of self-defense, which is to avoid meeting journalists.</p>
<p>However, when we first announce that we will not meet journalists, we are immediately labeled as "stuck-up" or "arrogant." As for why we don't want to meet journalists, they ignore it. They also don't think about their unreasonable treatment of film actors, and that kind of publicity is worse than no publicity at all. They even say that movie stars are ungrateful. They think about how, when we first arrived in Hollywood, we liked to see them, afraid that they wouldn't come; but now that we're rich, we don't need them, so we don't see them, and so on. In fact, these are all misunderstandings.</p>
<p>When we don't receive journalists, we can't draw up a list of who is okay and who is not. Therefore, we can only refuse to see everyone. This, in turn, angers all the reporters. So some people start attacking you and saying bad things about you. Everyone sees those attacking words, some suspect that we have really changed, and many who originally liked us gradually become indifferent. I have suffered all the hardships mentioned above, and I must express my personal attitude.</p>
<p>I think my life is very ordinary and monotonous. I don't have any interesting anecdotes to tell people. But what journalists are looking for are special stories. If they published that I get up at seven in the morning when I'm working; get up at ten in the morning when I'm not working; have breakfast and go to the company; work until late; and then go home and not go out. Then people would think, this person is too ordinary and boring, and some people would say, what's the point of writing this kind of story? So, if journalists want to write about my daily life, they can't write about my real daily life, and they have to "invent" and "create."</p>
<p>When I was not married, I couldn't help but sometimes go out with girlfriends, it is impossible for a man to marry every woman he has ever gone out with. But it is also extremely rare for a man to only go out with one woman in his life. But every time I went out with a woman, the gossip column in the newspapers and magazines immediately recorded it.</p>
<p>That wouldn't be too bad, if they didn't add comments or speculations. But what I read often says: "Gary Cooper and Iris Macon were at such and such place last night. Iris is Gary's latest lover, but Gary is unpredictable, will Iris have the ability to catch him?" When you read this news, don't you think it's annoying? The next day, when I call Iris, you can imagine how I feel. I nervously wonder if Iris has seen the news…will she be angry…will she suspect that I have any intentions.</p>
<p>If I'm not too difficult, a lot of journalists will come to see me in a day or two. After talking about a lot of irrelevant things, they can't help but mention Iris's name. They ask me if Iris is a good person? Of course, she's good, otherwise I wouldn't go out with her. The second question is, do I want to marry her? How am I supposed to answer that? (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Returning to "My Review"</h3>
<p>— Mao Di</p>
<p>"Return," appearing in a new guise of "Three Modern Women," must be considered a progressive work among outdated films. From the point of view of the subject matter, although it is still the old stuff that has been repeatedly described, such as unemployment, disasters, and some of the love and abandonment that should exist in cities, these are precisely the common facts in today's society, and tragic scenes are unfolding frantically in both rural and urban areas. Unfortunately, the director's skills are too weak, and he cannot express these things deeply, only superficially explaining the accidental phenomenon, and it can be said that he has only introduced a few people playing together.</p>
<p>Moreover, the director's allocation of film for these three protagonists is uneven and unreasonable. I think at least he should write more about the elder sister who has a clear mind for independent living, but now most of the drama seems to be doing a mediocre biography for an unsound romantic girl, so that in the audience's impression, they feel that this woman who struggled out of the old forces is a superfluous character. Even that clear-headed elder sister was almost misunderstood in some places, and this can be attributed to the director's inability to arrange the script well.</p>
<p>The theme of this film is not so much to indicate the right path for women's lives as it is to praise the creative power of mankind to overcome the natural environment. In this respect, the picture does not have sufficient characteristics.</p>
<p>The tone of the whole drama is always on the horizontal line from beginning to end, and there is no climax that suddenly stimulates people, a film without a climax may make people doze off.</p>
<p>There are many flaws in this film, but there are also things worth mentioning. The suicide scene is quite skillful, and the three songs sung in the ballroom are inserted naturally.</p>
<p>The actors all worked hard, but Fan Xuepeng and Lu Lixia, one pretended not to be like, the other did not reach home; Chen Yan was still good. (Missing section)</p>
<h3>After Seeing "Human Relations"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhen</p>
<p>"Human Relations" is a new masterpiece by the Star Film Company after "Raging Current," with its new style and correct consciousness, it exposes the cruel reality of the current unbalanced socio-economic system in its entirety, using an objective and serious attitude to face it squarely, this is indeed the success of the playwright, but what is regrettable is that the exposure is still not enough.</p>
<p>"Human Relations" describes a hardworking dock worker, whose son is injured in a fire, and because of economic difficulties, medical treatment is refused. Therefore, Yu San (played by Jia Nong) wants to go astray to find a way out, but as a result, he is sanctioned by the law and imprisoned. After being released from prison, his wife has married Lu Daxiong, and his son also works in his bank. Yu San begins his wandering life on the road, and is later introduced by his gambling friend Yu Ming to work as his son's servant. In the end, Yu Ming's conspiracy breaks out, and Yu San dies under the bullets of the police while saving his son.</p>
<p>Anyone cannot deny Gong Jia Nong's efforts. His success is that he can work hard. We can still recall our past impression of him in "Raging Current." This time, with his realistic makeup and profound inner expressions, compared to all his previous films, it can be regarded as the most successful.</p>
<p>In addition to Gong Jia Nong, there is also a new person in "Human Relations"—Yuan Shaomei (playing Yu Lin's mother). It is rare for him to be able to play three different roles in the first time on the screen.</p>
<p>Regarding the photography aspect, of course, there are some places that cannot satisfy people. But Mr. Chen is also a new figure, and it is very gratifying that he has such achievements. The light is still good, but some places are unclear, but it is not a big problem. (Missing section)</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF DIAN TONG'S GLORY</h3>
<p>1.  Zhou Boxun is in contact with various parties for location shooting of "The Goddess of Liberty," and already went to Hangzhou last Sunday. Situ Huimin, Wang Ying, and Zhang Yunqiao took the early train this morning from Shanghai to Hangzhou. As for the cameras, props, and staff, they are traveling in a Dian Tong truck, which is the third batch of people.</p>
<p>2.  In "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm," there was a kissing scene between Tan Ying and Yuan Muzhi, which had already been filmed, but director Xu Xingzhi, in pursuit of perfection, disregarding Tan Ying's shyness, tried it three more times. Although this was difficult for Tan Ying, "Our Poet" Yuan Muzhi won three times in a row and had great romantic luck.</p>
<p>3.  The lead actress for Dian Tong's fourth sound film, "Metropolitan Scenery," is being recruited through public advertisement in order to implement the original intention of using new talent. The number of applicants has been exceptionally high in recent days, and Dian Tong will unintentionally discover a new talent again.</p>
<p>4.  With continuous spring rain, puddles of water have formed on Dian Tong's cement basketball court. The basketball players, feeling stifled by the weather, have all flocked to the ping pong room, immediately creating a vibrant atmosphere.</p>
<h3>WU CUN AND "FALLING BLOSSOMS"</h3>
<p>— You Guang</p>
<p>Wu Cun has received good praise in the Chinese film scene for his film "Remarriage."</p>
<p>His technique is light, the scenes are beautiful, and every foot of film is deeply imbued with poetry.</p>
<p>From the poetic title "Falling Blossoms," it is easy to imagine that this must be a sentimental and melancholic love story, but in reality, its theme is anti-imperialist. It depicts a group of righteous volunteers who, due to insufficient food and ammunition, have retreated and wandered into a big city. They shake off the coercion of hunger with tenacity, never becoming discouraged; they love to joke and make trouble, and have even suffered from women, but when the war breaks out again, they stand on the same front line.</p>
<p>The film is written and directed by Wu Cun, and the leading actors include Shen Lai, Sui Nong, Zhao Dan, Wang Xianqi, Gu Meijun, Gu Lanjun, etc. (Actually)</p>

<h3>CLOUD SKY HATE BARRIER (LIVING ON VELVET) (4)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>It was already two o'clock in the morning, and the two of them were still wandering outside without going home. At this time, they were eating beef pies in a food truck. The food vendor was not excited about having business. He felt that these high-class men and women did not even know when to close up shop, which was really annoying. But he couldn't bring himself to drive them away. So he said, "It's a good morning today." Thore didn't understand what he meant and retorted, "It looks like it's going to rain." The truck owner said again, "But the forecast in the newspaper is for sunny and warm weather." Thore said, "Then let's pray for rain." Amy also said, "I like rain." Saying that, the two of them still refused to leave. The truck owner had no choice but to let them be.</p>
<p>After a while, Thore seemed to realize something and exclaimed, "Oh, a joke, we haven't even exchanged names yet!" Amy said, "I've known your name for a long time. You're Thore Parker. I knew it as soon as I saw you because Walter mentioned you to me." Thore, upon hearing this, jumped up and said, "Then who are you?" Amy asked strangely, "Aren't I Amy? Don't you know?"</p>
<p>Thore, upon hearing this, seemed to have lost something, and his spirits immediately drooped. After a while, he muttered to himself. ( ) Of course, you are Amy... Walter's Amy... Amy said, "Just Amy is fine." Thore continued to mutter to himself, "There's a street lamp on Fifth Avenue, a leaf in Central Park, and a woman in New York. Millions of lamps, millions of women, but you just happen to be Walter's Amy." Amy said, "I'm not anyone's Walter or anything." Thore said, "But he loves you." Amy said, "Not that much." Thore said, "Of course you love him too." Amy said, "I don't see it that way either."</p>
<p>The two of them then stood up and went home. They didn't say much on the way. When Thore took Amy home, the guests had already left, but Walter hadn't left yet. Amy saw Walter and walked up to him, patting his shoulder and saying, "I know we shouldn't have left. Please forgive me." Thore stood aside, watching the two of them coldly, and couldn't help but say, "What a pair of lovers!" Then he said goodnight to them and quietly walked away alone.</p>
<p>The next day, Amy was sitting alone at home. She didn't eat anything all day. All she thought about was Thore... his expression when he left last night had been indelibly imprinted in her mind. After dinner, Walter came. Amy greeted him with infinite hope in her heart, but Walter shook his head slightly at her. Amy was holding a cigarette in her hand, but hadn't lit it. She unconsciously tore the cigarette paper to shreds. She said suddenly, "You must find him... do you understand? If you don't find him, don't come back..." Walter said, "I understand... I'll go again..."</p>
<p>Amy reached out her hand and shook his, saying, "I'm really sorry for you..." Walter said, "It's nothing. You love him, I know. As long as you're happy, I'm happy too." Upon hearing this, Amy's tears were about to burst out of her eyes, but she held back her tears and said, "You are the most righteous person in the world. You will find him, won't you?" Walter said, "That's right, I'll go guide him back."</p>
<p>Walter was a really good person. He soon found Thore and brought him home. Thore was taking a bath, and Amy had already received the news and rushed over, unable to wait even a minute. She met Thore in the bathroom, and they not only met but also got engaged. Regardless of her aunt Martha's protests, she married Thore in a church ceremony, and Walter was their only witness.

<h3>INCREASE IN US AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION CAPACITY</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>ON PAR WITH PEAK YEARS</p>
<p>The American automobile manufacturing industry has recently shown a vigorous surge forward. According to Reuters, the March automobile production in the United States this year will be similar to the production of four years and nine months ago. Since May 1930, that is, fifty-seven months ago, the production of automobiles and freight trucks has never reached the number of 400,000 units. According to observers, this March, the automobile production will not only be the same as the level mentioned above, but will also exceed it. Therefore, it seems that the average total production per week in March will be around 100,000 units. The week has just ended, and the production volume has not yet been calculated. However, in fact, it is allowed to be the first time since the five-day work week became legal that the number has been reached.</p>
<p>Regardless of the month, if automobile production exceeds the number of 400,000 units, then statisticians consider it to be beyond normal. In 1930, there were only three such months: March, April, and May. 1929 was generally considered the prosperous year for the automotive industry. There were nine such months that year. There were eight in 1928, only three in 1927, six in 1926, and in 1925, automobile production reached approximately 4 million units, with five months exceeding the number.</p>
<p>When the production capacity of each automobile factory returns to 100,000 units per week, the heads of each factory plan a very careful step to avoid the hardships caused by overproduction in the past from reappearing today. At present, everyone believes that among all industries, the automobile manufacturing industry can be called a pillar of support. Major manufacturers are gradually increasing production, and according to reports from various sources, retail sales are also rising. However, in view of the instability in the market, such as the decline in stock market prices, the factory is also very careful and prudent. Other reasons for the factory's caution are the chaotic situation abroad, the obvious decline in the market for products, and the uncertain future of the recovery policy, all of which cause the executives of the factory to have concerns.</p>
<p>Engineers who plan and manufacture new types of automobiles are very puzzled by the fact that vehicle traffic accidents seem to be trending towards similar patterns. The occurrence of such accidents is unavoidable even for those with driving experience. In fact, investigations have shown that many experienced drivers are among the victims of these accidents. It is generally believed that the occurrence of such events is mostly due to drivers taking the mechanical structure of the automobile too lightly, unaware that the automobile they are driving is completely different from the ones they were used to seven or eight years ago. Today's automobiles have constantly increasing engine power and speed compared to those of seven or eight years ago. The brakes and other safety equipment are all extremely commensurate. It is a pity that the shortcomings of our minds cannot be managed by automobile engineers. Those who are negligent in this regard often cause great disasters and even lose their lives. It is estimated that between 1927 and 1934, the average horsepower of brakes increased from 65.8 horsepower to 112.5 horsepower. The situation is slightly different this year, with a slight drop to 109.6 horsepower.</p>
<p>The Indiana branch of the Society of Automotive Engineers recently held a meeting. The engineer Li Waierte Feiershi in that city raised a question for discussion. His idea was that the new cars of 1934 and 1935 have increased a lot of power, have no vibrations, and are very quiet, but in terms of accidents, he was afraid that there would be no decrease, but rather an increase. Drivers who are used to driving old-style cars will inevitably encounter difficulties when they change to new ones. In addition, because of the stability of the action, and the increase in power to the maximum limit, they are unaware of it and do not pay attention to the speedometer, turning the car at high speed. Moreover, after testing, it was found that when the car turns too fast, it is like a flash of lightning, not knowing whether the weight of the car body is balanced or not. By the time they realize it, it is too late, etc.</p>
<h3>TALKING ABOUT THE HEAT SUPPLY OF THE CARBURETOR SYSTEM</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Any liquid, to make it evaporate into a gas, must be given considerable heat. The carburetor system of an automobile is also the same. As far as the gasoline sold on the market for automobiles is concerned, only a very small part of it can evaporate in ordinary atmospheric temperature. Even in hot summer weather, this is the case. In ordinary gasoline, in addition to this very small portion that is easy to evaporate, the rest, if it contains the heaviest molecules, has a boiling point that can reach as high as 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, in order to obtain proper evaporation and suitable spraying of gasoline to save fuel, the gasoline must be given considerable heat. Usually, this heat is applied after the gasoline has already evaporated.</p>
<p>In the past, the gasoline contained more easily evaporating molecules than difficult-to-evaporate molecules, so this kind of gasoline could be used anywhere. This kind of gasoline first heats the air before it enters the carburetor, then jackets the mixing chamber of the carburetor with a water jacket, and also jackets the intake pipe with a water jacket. After that, letting the water from the engine cooling system circulate in this water jacket can achieve the most satisfactory results. The water in this water jacket usually exceeds 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Such a low temperature is not suitable for evaporating the gasoline that contains more difficult-to-evaporate molecules now. That being said, this method of heating with a water jacket is a much greater improvement than the carburetors of the past that had no heating equipment at all.</p>
<p>As for heating the gasoline when it is still a liquid, the effect is also very good because the evaporation of the lighter molecules in the gasoline can be greatly helped by this, and the fuel is more economical. What is even more ideal is that in automobiles that are supplied with oil by vacuum tanks, in order to make the gasoline in the tank warm by the heat emitted by the engine cylinders, the position of the vacuum tank must be as close to the engine and carburetor as possible. Regarding the heating of liquid gasoline, this problem has been tested. The gasoline in the carburetor float chamber was heated by using a heating coil through which current supplied by a storage battery passed. As a result, it proved to be very successful for starting a cold engine. There are now several carburetors that have installed this type of electric primer. However, this type of heating equipment can only be used for starting the engine because it requires a very large amount of electricity. If used continuously, the current in the battery will be used up in a short time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>HUDSON AND TERRAPLANE UNIFORMLY ADOPT DOUBLE-FLOW LUBRICATION SYSTEM</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Regarding the various inspection works on automobile engines, the ones adopted by the Hudson Mechanical Engineering Department should be considered the most rigorous and difficult. This is uniformly praised by the city of Detroit and generally recognized by the public. Not long ago, a 1935 Terrapin engine completed a 208-hour test. In this test, the engine speed used was equal to 84 miles per hour. If this engine were installed in a car, its mileage could reach 17,472 miles in nine days. In other words, at a speed of 84 miles per hour, without stopping or slowing down, it could cross America six times. According to the Hudson engineers, this type of test is of great importance to the lubrication system. In this test, each piston stroke was equal to 7,878 miles, the camshaft rotated 24,960,000 times, and the crankshaft rotated 49,920,000 times. The endurance movements of the other parts were also commendable. However, even after this arduous work, there was absolutely no impact or damage to any part of the engine when it was disassembled. Also, the lower end bearing of the connecting rod was at the forefront of this type of test, but as a result, the average degree of wear was less than three ten-thousandths of an inch. As for the pistons, they were undamaged, and all the bearing surfaces on the piston pins were also as good as new. All of this is due to the perfect lubrication system that made it so. The lubrication system used is a double-flow type, which uses a double-acting reciprocating pump to distribute the oil through both ends of the crankshaft and through the guide pipes to the oil tank, where it is collected from the lower end of the connecting rod to apply oil to all necessary parts with great pressure. The excellent operating performance of the Hudson and Terrapin engines is one of the characteristics of this lubrication system. Once the engine is started, the oil is immediately transmitted to all moving parts. This alone is one of the outstanding advantages of the Hudson double-flow lubrication system that is far beyond reach.</p>
<h3>THE SO-CALLED "F.O.B." PRICE OF US AUTOMOBILE FACTORIES</h3>
<p>The so-called "F.O.B." (Free On Board) Factory Price of a car from an American automobile factory is 850 yuan.</p>
<p>In fact, you cannot buy this car at this price. In the United States, if the "F.O.B." price of a car is 1,000 yuan or less, the delivered price is often about 25% higher than the "F.O.B." price. Assuming there is a more expensive car with a "F.O.B." price of 1,026 yuan, then you have to pay 1,173 yuan in New York to buy it, which is an increase of about 14%.</p>
<p>Automobile industries in various countries, if they want to compare the "F.O.B." price of American cars with the delivered price, should remember the facts mentioned above, and should pay attention to automobile retailers or salesmen. If they use the pricing of American automobiles to undermine their competitors, do not be deceived by them, because the pricing of American automobiles is specifically for an empty car, without bumpers or spare tires, which are essential parts of the car. Other parts that are indispensable in the current situation are also missing.</p>
<p>The equipment included in the "F.O.B." price of American automobiles varies depending on the brand. Generally, safety glass, front and rear insurance bumpers, clocks, spare tires, double tail lights, and double horns are not included. In fact, no one in the United States can buy a car at the list price. Not to mention overseas countries, which have to add transportation, tax, insurance, and other fees.</p>
<p>Occasionally, an American runs to an automobile factory and asks to buy a car at the list price, but he inevitably pays some tips, and he also has to bring a letter of introduction and say many moral good words before he can drive the car away. All the essential safety equipment can be properly equipped.</p>
<p>The pricing of American automobiles was originally just a basis for accounting, used to indicate the category to which each car should be classified, and not the actual price of each car. However, just because of this pricing, many doubts have arisen in the overseas automotive industry after seeing it in various magazines and publications.</p>
<h3>ABOVE IS A VIEW OF THE SPACIOUS SEATS OF A 1935 BRITISH STANDARD CAR</h3>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Doubts have arisen, and it is inevitable that criticism will be directed at automobile import firms because the so-called pricing in the United States is clearly inconsistent with the selling price overseas.</p>
<p>It should be known that the price paid by Americans for cars is indeed lower than the price paid overseas, but this is not due to the fault of the factory, nor is it due to the fault of the import firm. Part of the reason lies in the special needs of export trade, and part of the reason lies in the additional costs of packaging, transportation, and taxes, among which taxes are the largest.</p>
<p>Many American automobile factories often go the extra mile for export cars, such as equipping special steering knuckles and springs to adapt to the road conditions in overseas markets.</p>
<p>Since transportation and taxes are added to the list price, its overseas price will be twice the price in the United States, or even more. However, import firms do not profit from this. Because the profit of importers is based on the total investment, not just the investment in automobiles. If importers only profit 25% on the price of automobiles and do not seek to profit from freight and taxes, then the result will only be a gross profit of 15%, and in reality, they will inevitably suffer losses.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a famous automobile factory changed its policy. The prices quoted were not "F.O.B." prices, but prices delivered to several major cities, and ultimately suffered a great failure.</p>
<p>However, the proposal for reform is now unanimously supported. Most export experts and domestic experts advocate thorough reform and abandoning the "F.O.B." price. Mr. Colin, the sales manager of a special factory, recently stated at the Detroit Transportation Association: "We don't want to say (you have 900 yuan to buy a car, but if you want a complete car, you have to pay 1,200 yuan), etc."</p>
<p>Many overseas distribution points also deeply resent and hate this system because it easily leads to misunderstandings. Car customers who do not use their brains occasionally see the price list in American magazines and immediately make a quick judgment, thinking that importers are asking for excessive prices and are deeply dissatisfied. For this reason, American exporters also want to plan reforms in order to save the situation.</p>
<p>Some advocate prohibiting the pricing of automobiles from being published in export publications. However, some exporters do not think so, because publication can prevent distribution points from seeking improper benefits. And even if exporters do not publish, other publications will publish it, so prohibition is useless.</p>
<p>The most important method is to make the overseas automotive industry thoroughly understand the American "F.O.B." price. It should be known that this price is just a basis. From this basis, the actual price that the car owner has to pay can be calculated, and the category of various prices can be expressed.</p>
