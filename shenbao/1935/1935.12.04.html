<p>時評</p>
<h3>所望於五屆一中全會者</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>五屆中央執監委員。已於前晨宣誓就職。並卽舉行一中全會。集賢俊於一堂抒。匡時之偉略。其盛况爲歷屆所未有。蓋五全大會所表現之特殊精神。卽在團結二字。平日各方意氣。容有未盡浹洽之處。而在此次大會之前。俱能捐泯私見。共謀國是。以完成全會之使命。充實中央之力量。天步維艱。國難雖殷。今以全力臨之。矢實結之精誠。謀一致之步調。宜有足以挽頹勢而臻康復者。一中全會承五全大會之後。整理已决之議案。開創未來之政局。對於過去不能自滿之現象。在多量才彥檢討之下。必能積極予以刷新。用慰下民喁喁之望。吾人以憔悴之餘生。佇宏猷之展布。亦誠有不能已於言者。敢藉時會。略貢芻蕘。</p>
<p>今日當前唯一嚴重問題。孰不知爲外交局面之待打開。茲事體大。中央旣巳决定方針。布告中外。吾人自亦不欲妄參末議。唯盼當局打疊堅毅邁往之精神。速謀切合實際之肆應。勿再遲迥猶豫。坐令滋蔓難圖。關於應付外交。此其一。</p>
<p>我國連年遭逢災饉。洊更要亂。民生憔悴。已達極點。無日不盼有存卹之者。在位諸公。亦匪不知此爲要圖。思振擢之自我。故歷次大會席上。常得聞慷慨之建議。委宛之提案。而一到大會閉幕之後。或事涉窒礙。延擱未見施行。或奉辦不力。明令等於具文。苛捐雜稅。雖稱裁撤。而地方猶有藉名附征者。貪污懲戒。律有專條。而僚屬仍多上下其手者。此外如土劣橫恣。吏胥朋比地方秕政。所在多有。在此次一中全會中。應如何痛下决心。確定辦法。以發揮行政之效能。掃除瀰漫之濁氛。項知空言不足以療飢渴。實施方得云副民望。關於刷新內政。此其二。</p>
<p>輓近人情習於澆愉。類多籍阿諛取容合。賢者以明哲自處。亦唯效金人之緘口。諍直之風。幾歇絕於天下矣。中央大員。職高位尊。平日氣體所安。言莫予違。而人非聖哲。寗能無誤。求借鑒之無由。斯遂過而莫改。昔人所謂千夫之諾諾不如一士之諤諤。固應爲有道所珍視。而不容等閒小覷也。就令袞袞諸公。均能自飭其躬。而官事紛繁。僚屬充盈。何能必其一一無尤。使民間言論。未獲自由。卽一切愆失。壅於上聞。地方秕政難期革除。轉令在位代受其惡。防口之戒。昔賢所懍。矧在今日情勢之下乎。此次大會諸公。允宜互布腹心。務竭虛己之忱。確收傾聽之效。獎進言官。博徵輿論。一方以爲在位耳目之助。一方亦袪下僚朦蔽之途。旣足以策吏治。亦復能正人心。關於開放言路。此其三。</p>
<p>以上三端。雖屬老生膚淺之常談。要爲吾人衷誠之願望。輒不憚喋喋於一中全會時一申提之。深冀大會有以慰吾人之翹企也。</p>

<h3>海軍會議「前哨戰」　英主巨艦大砲主義　日人莆團都廿九人抵倫敦　有提訂英美法日新恊定御</h3>
<p>（倫敦）日本代表團到倫敦後、軍縮會議已入前哨戰、據聞英國政府關於主力艦之噸數主張旣有變更、轉採大艦巨砲主義、因此會議情形與預備會議當時不同、卽英國從來主張主力艦最大限噸數爲二萬六千噸、備砲十二寸、然因在地中海與意大利空軍對抗之結果、决定增加主力艦噸數爲三萬噸以上（二日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）參與倫敦海軍會議之日代表團都二十九人、經西比利亞來英、已於今日行抵倫敦、此次人數雖衆、但不若去冬參與三國討論者之足引起一般人士之深刻印象、據總代表長野海軍大將今“聲稱、日本不背離其所官布根據主要海軍國應訂定共同高限度之政策云、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）日本代表團已於今晨抵此、出席海軍會議之首席代表永野大將向美聯社稱、日本亟欲避免國際海軍競爭、惟如會議結果、不能成立新約、則日本亦須保全己國之地位、日本固决心維持在海軍强國中之地位、惟此項决心、並非卽爲立刻增加其海軍之噸位、日本之安全及聲譽所不可缺者爲海軍平等、且亦贊成保留華盛頓條約禁止任何國家在太平洋頭土中設防之規定云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）民聲報載東京電稱、出席海軍會議之日本代表團曾携有覓求保持太平洋和平之美英法日新協定計劃、廣田外相預測海軍會議失敗後、此項協定仍有成立之可能、廣田希望太平洋新公約將包括下列各點、（一）菲列濱之永久中立、美國留駐菲列濱之海陸軍永久退出、（二）續訂並修正一九二一年之四國公約、使其成爲不侵略公約、（三）四國各自保證不攻擊或侵害太平洋方面之任何領土、（四）續訂華盛頓海軍公約第十九條、規定今後仍不得在太平洋指定島嶼設防、該記者表示、此項公約必無成功之望、蓋接受廣田之計劃無異實事上承認日本獨霸西太平洋及日軍在華之自由行動也、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）報載日本覓求太平洋和平之新協定、此間官塲對之殊爲冷淡、國務院方面宣稱、出席倫敦海軍會議之美國代表團携有裁减軍備之訓令、此外別無使命云、其他方面則認報載消息意在試探美國對於不侵略公約之意見、但蘇俄要求與日本締結此項條約已有數年之久、故此間自聞日本欲與美英法締結此項條約、對於蘇俄則置之不理、殊堪驚異、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）據倫敦來電、傳英國因意阿戰爭、設想英意間之英意海戰、並因戰略關係、頓轉向大艦巨砲主義云、日本海軍對此見解如下，由多數小艦主義轉向大艦主義消息之眞爲、現尙不明、惟由向來主張及國家狀態觀之、恐係含有政治意味之官傳、傳其轉向之理由、係在强化防禦水平水上所需之裝甲、然强化裝甲乃華府條約所規定、係預測將來航空機及潛水艦之發達、對旣成艦允增加三千噸範圍裝甲上之噸數、新艦爲三萬五千噸、卽由此意味、故因裝甲而今更轉向、實不成理由、要之、美國因維持遠東政策、遂採取作戰遠東爲目標之大艦主義、且傳有以三萬二千噸爲限縮小之意、故英國使接近美國之主張、實不外其間由深海共同動作、欲指導軍縮會議之政治工作、又英國由紳士態度力主將旣存條約之三萬五千噸、縮小爲二萬六千噸之澈底軍縮、則此次之轉向、顯係意欲擴充軍備充有背軍縮精神、若有此類提案出現、日本毫不感受痛癢、惟有依旣定方針、貫澈邁進云、（三日電通電）</p>

<h3>世界航空綱的擴展</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>十天環繞全球的可能性</p>
<p>美國的「中國號」巨型飛機，新近以五天的工夫，完成了八千哩的太平洋航程。這不僅使美亞兩洲間的交通關係，躍進了一步。而且在全世界的航空大鏈鎖中，也增加了更重要的一環。從此這個圓溜溜的地球，除了北大西洋還沒有航空路綫之外，好像蒙上了一個「看不見的網」。在昔，什麼八十天，四個月，環繞地球一次，大家都目爲異事。現在呢，據美國雷門氏推測，不上四年，我們可以在十天之間，乘了飛機環繞地球一次，這眞是前人所夢想不到的。</p>
<p>全世界航空網的完成，把各大洲連繫起來，還是近十年來的事。國際間的旅行途程。時間，縮之再縮，减之再减，從幾星期戚到幾天，再從幾天縮短到幾小時。那向來目爲天涯地角，遠不可接的地方，一天天地關係增長起來。人與人間的交際。情感，都不期然而然的密切起來了。由歐美各大都市爲出發點的國際航空中心，巳經有如下的連絡：</p>
<p>（一）倫敦航空綫路可達全歐，由英京南下，飛過非洲的脊背，一直到達尾閭的開普城。再經米索布達米到印度。新加坡，最後越鐵摩爾海到達澳大利亞。</p>
<p>（二）巴黎一個人坐了飛機從法京出發，先到馬賽，再由那里東飛到印度支那的西貢，或者經由地中海埠港，向西南飛航，信件等便能直達塞內加爾，威德角羣島，經越南大西洋而到巴西的納塔爾。</p>
<p>（三）柏林，從德京作航空旅行，如往蘇俄去，可直達莫斯科，或列寗格勒。另外一條路，經過西班牙到西非口岸的達卡，冉到南美西岸各城。</p>
<p>（四）荷蘭阿姆斯德丹，是荷蘭的一個重要都市。航空綫從那里貫通中歐，沿着印度洋的邊岸，最遠可達荷屬東印度的蘇拉白亞，共有九千哩的路程。</p>
<p>（五）舊金山就是現在新造完成的泛美航空綫，直達菲列濱的馬尼刺，中經夏威夷島，其途程爲八千五百哩。</p>
<p>英國·法國·荷蘭，它們都經營着東方的航空綫。那三條綫到印度差不多作平行式。法人與德人相互的開展南大西洋航綫，把非洲和南美連繫起來，從此歐洲的商業中心，可和非美兩洲，互有呼應之妙了。</p>
<p>美國在國際航空體系裏，包含着三大航綫。一、拉丁美洲系，二、阿拉斯加系，三、泛美航綫的中國系。這最後一系便是最近開航成功的太平洋綫。在不久之將來，將由這綫中點的夏威夷島，向南擴展到新西蘭。這樣，世界的航空網就格外完密了。上而所說的第一系——拉丁美洲，航綫全程達三萬二千哩，差不多週航了南美的周緣，從倍諾斯愛勒到紐約，只要五天工夫。</p>
<p>英國的帝國航綫，除了從倫敦到開普城，和經由印度到澳洲之外，另有一綫接通新加坡和香港。至於北大西洋一綫將來也不難實現。目下德人對於這一綫的規劃，最爲努力。德國的勒夫生沙航綫，滿佈了中歐各地，郵航已取道非洲直達南美。最近荷國皇家航綫董事長派利門氏聲稱，德國的航空團體，在不久的將來，擬在北大西洋作郵航試飛。這個不久的將來，據說就是明年。在大洋中用母艦作爲歇止的地點，好像現在南大西洋所用的一樣。德國除了到蘇俄的航空綫之外，還有在中國飛航的歐亞航空公司。</p>
<p>最近完成的太平洋一綫，籌備到現在已經好幾年了。在今夏就利用着各個根據點試飛。當時測量這條航綫的時候，曾經特僱了一隻大輪船，載了許多專家，從事於測量工作。全程差不多達九千哩，和荷蘭阿姆斯德達姆至蘇拉白亞一綫不相上下。第一站是從加利福尼亞出發到夏威夷，再經由中途島·湖島·關島。而達菲島的馬尼刺。</p>
<p>在茫茫的大洋之中，那些原來祗有海鳥在四週飛翔，闐無人跡的小島上，建築着白色整潔的航空根據站，作爲駕駛人和旅客們歇息之用，那裏有舒適的屋宇，冬天有熱水汀，夏天有空氣調節裝置。食堂·廚房·辦公房·俱樂部·花和菜的種植園·無綫電站，浮碼頭等，無不應有盡有。一切設備都和都市裏相仿，身居其中，可以叫人忘記處身在蒼茫無際，怒濤洶湧的大洋中。</p>
<p>費五天的光陰可以從美洲到遠東，目下已經實現了。再進步呢，就是要在十天之中週遊全世界。前面已經說過，這個計劃在四年之中可望完成，那時候如果一個人從紐約坐着巨型機出發，一天半到達歐洲，四天到新加坡，或荷屬東印度的蘇拉白亞，再轉馬尼刺，飛過太平洋（遵循現在完成的新航綫），到舊金山，再半天橫斷美洲重返紐約，一共恰好是旬日時光。古時候費長房所夢想的縮地栩，現在是可以說實現了。</p>

<h3>我國的科學研究事業　（十一月二十六日對全國中等學校學生演講）</h3>
<p>— 中央研究院總幹事丁文江</p>
<p>科學研究事業在中國纔不過有二十年的歷史，而中央政府所屬的機關，有中央研究院，北平研究院，實業部的地質調查所，農業實騐所，工業實騐所，經濟委員會的蠶絲改良會，棉產改進所，茶葉及畜牧改良塲，衛生實騐處以及軍事機關所屬的實驗室等等。再加上各大學的研究院和各省政府所屬的研究機關，如兩廣，湖南，河南地質調查所之類。政府所用於科學研究的經費，合計起來在三百五十萬元以上。此外私立的團體，在北平有靜生生物調查所，在塘沽有黃海工業化學研究社，在天津有南開大學經濟學院，在南京有中國科學社的生物研究所，在重慶有中國西部科學院，他們經費一共大概在三十萬元左右。所以公私兩方面用於科學研究的欵項，每年當不下四百萬元。</p>
<p>要在幾十分鐘裏面說明公私各機關的工作成績，當然是不可能的。最近蔡孑民先生在六中全會紀念週講演，有一篇有系統的報告，登在十一月五日至八日的中央日報，諸位可以拿來參考。我今天與下次二十八日講演，祇能就我所知道最詳細的幾個機關，向諸位報告。</p>
<p>中關科學研究機關成立最早的是實業部的地質調查所。民國元年南京的臨時政府，在實業部確政司之下，巳經設了一個地質詞查所。民國二年北京政府把他改爲地質科，三年又改爲地質調查所，仍屬於礦政司。田野的工作民　二年已經開始。同時爲養成技術人員起見，農商部與北京大學合辦了一個地質研究所。民國五年，地質調查所改爲地質調查局，離開了礦政司而獨立。以後雖然再由局改所，但是性質上仍是農商部的附屬機關，與民國五年以前不同。地質研究所同時於民國五年停辦，畢業的眞生就是當日地質調查局的基本職員。</p>
<p>地質調查所開辦的時候，大部分的工作是研究中國的礦產，特別是煤鐵。鐵礦研究當日有瑞典的地質家安得生先生指導。從民國五年到民國十年，五年之間，所發現的新的鐵礦有一萬萬噸之多。同時所有北方的重要煤田都經過了科學的研究。結果是我們第一次對於中國的煤鐵儲量，得到了比較可靠的估計。許多人都知道，六十五年前，有一位著名的德國地質家Richthofer李希霍芬子爵到中國來作地質旅行。他在中國不過兩年，元旅行的區域很廣，所以當然不能作任何詳細的工作。他看見中國到處有煤——尤其在北方幾省——而且當時山西的土法煉鐵，還沒有受外國鋼鐵的影響。所以他以爲中國的煤鐵工業，前途異常遠大。從此世界上人都以爲中國是礦產最豐富的國家，是第二個美國。一八九六年德國人的侵略膠州，以及各國人的要求礦權，都是受了他宜傳的影響。等到地質調查所成立以後，我們詳細研究的結果，纔知道一方面可以發現新的鐵礦，一方面舊式的鐵礦事業，如山西的平定潞安澤州，沒有存在的可能。煤量雖然比鐵礦豐富的多，但也遠不及一般人想像之大。民國二年國際地質學會所出版的「世界之煤量」，說中國的煤量，有九百九十六億之多。（億等於一千兆）地質調查所研究的結果，纔知道實在的煤量不到上面所說的數目四分之一，而旦大的煤田，離海岸很遠，可以練焦的煙煤，並不很多。所以中國的富源，不能希望與西歐或北美作比較的。</p>
<p>煤鐵如此，石油，銅，鉛，金，銀等礦也是如此。這種礦分佈都有相當的面積，備量都不很大。只有江西的鎢，湖南的銻，雲南的錫是我們的特產——尤其是鎢與銻，這兩種金屬品我們可以支配世界的市塲。</p>
<p>地質調查所基本的職務是測量全國的地質圖。地質調查所普通用的比例尺，除去了特別重要的地點以外，是二十萬分之一。已經出版的村抖一部分是二十萬分之一，一部分是一百萬分之。一百萬分之一的地質圖，照國際協定，每張應包括緯度四度，經度六度。如果把新疆，西藏，蒙古，靑海，西康，東三省除外，應該有三十張圖，纔能够普遍全國。二十年努力的結果，巳經測量的面積，只够做十二張圖。但是所測量的面積已經在一百五十萬方公里以上！</p>
<p>除去了研究確產測量地質圖以外，與地質有關係的科學，如礦物，岩石，古生物，當然也在地質調查所工作範圍之內。其中古生物尤爲重要。因爲要作地質圖，先要知道地層的分類，古生物學是地層學的根本。民國九年，地質調查所與北京大學合聘前美國哥倫比亞大學敎授葛利普先生Alabou爲古生物組主任兼北京大學敎授。葛先生不久就訓練一班靑年，做中國古生物的工作。地質調查所出版一　古生物誌，專門印刷這種工作的結果。古生物誌第一册是民國十年出版的。到民國二十二年爲止，共出了七十册，共有六千四百多頁。中國人之外，有英美德法瑞典古生物家的著作。古生物誌變成功國際上很有名的刊物。除古生物之外，地質調查所還出版了二十四冊彙刋，十七冊專報，一共有七千幾百頁。這幾乎完全是本國地質學者的著作。</p>
<p>上面所說的都是地質學者分內的工作。近幾年來地質調查所於他的分內工作以外，又研究地震，土壤燃料與先史。</p>
<p>地震的研究，完全是地質調查所長翁文灝先生個人興趣的產物。民國九年，甘肅大地震，受害的人在十萬以上。翁先生那時代理地質調查所所畏。到廿肅去調查回來，就注意中國歷史上關於地震的紀錄。民國十九年，因爲有朋友捐助，纔在北平的西山建築一個地震室。設有Wiccher地震儀兩副，Galilsin儀三副，適合於所謂頭等地震室的設備。從十九年以來，繼續觀察，每兩月出專報一册，與世界各國的地震研究交換。</p>
<p>地震研究室成立以後，不久地質調查所又受中華敎育文化基金會的委託，組織土壤研究室。先後請了兩位美國人主持其事。慢慢的訓練了許多本國的靑年作土壤調查的工作。並且發行一種土壤專報，登戡他們工作的結果。</p>
<p>許多年努力於田野工作的結果，大家漸漸覺得在中國很少有發現大量石油的希望。於是地質調查所漸漸的注意到利用煤量煉汽油的問題。起初也得到私人捐欵，最近又受經濟委員會的補助，在南京建築燃料研究室，專門研究低溫蒸溜與氫化，希望將來能够利用我們的煤，來供給我們汽油的需要。</p>
<p>最後還有和協和醫學校合作的新生代地質研究室。民國十年安特生先生在距北平一百里的周口店地方，發現了脊椎動物的化石。民國十六年·地質調查所得到了羅氏基金的補助，請恊和醫學校解剖系的主任布拉克先生為名譽主任。領導楊鍾健裴文中先生，在周口店石灰山洞開始大規模的發掘。不久就發現了所謂「北京人」Sinanthropuspekinensis的骸骨。這是世界上最古的人種之一。到現在爲止。　得了有二十幾個人的遺骨。並且有石器和用火的遺痕。這是我們對於世界先史學上極大的貢獻。所以現在國際科學界幾乎沒有人不知道中國地質調查所工作的重要。</p>
<p>這是我國最早研究科學機關的小史。現在大多數人都知道地質調查所的成績，但是很少有人了解他的成功的秘訣和當事人的犧。民國以來，北京政府設的研究機關，地質調查所以外，還有許多，何以祇有這個至　　　而且受社會上的稱許呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>儲滙局剴切勸告國人　投保簡易壽險　政府創辦目的在發展國民經濟　望人民善爲利用穩固制度基礎</h3>
<p>國營簡易人壽保險、上海·南京·兩處、巳同時舉行開幕、因此項事業、係爲國家專營、尙屬初創、其裨益於國計民生者、至爲重大、保險處長張明昕、以當此開辦之初、社會各界人士雖巳注意、但對於投保手續及保險利益、容或未能深切瞭解、昨特向大公社起者發表談、剴切勸告國人踴躍投保、茲紀其談話如次、</p>
<p>扶助國民經濟損失</p>
<p>簡易壽險、籌備數年、能於前日（二日）開辦、實爲鄙人參加此項事業之最榮幸事、開幕時蒙各界領袖光臨指導、及加入投保以資提倡、曁民衆之踴躍參加、尤爲感謝、簡易壽險與普通壽險、原理雖無二致、而其目的則有不同、因其手續簡便、保費低微、旣無檢騐身體之繁、又可按月繳納保費僅由一角至六元、故凡屬國民、月納數角保費、皆可投保、換言之、亦即所謂家庭保險、因一家之中、無論男女、凡滿十二歲至六十歲者皆可投保、政府創辦簡易壽險、其目的主抉助國民經濟之損失、以免因夭亡之結果、而使其依賴無流入貧困、然政府旣有此項制度之創設、尤在人民能善爲利用、人民之利用者愈多、則其制度基礎將愈穩固、現值開辦伊始、敢供獻於投保諸君、</p>
<p>投保聲請確切填寫</p>
<p>塡寫投保聲請書、切須確實簡易壽險、因爲不檢身體、惟同時亦應防範體質過於贏弱、或有宿疾者之乘機加入、致大多數之被保險者、日後應享受之利益、蒙感不良影響、故對於投保聲請書、須有明晰確實之記載、以爲承保與否之决定、如年齡之大小、及旣往疾病經過、與現在健康如何、均應據實塡寫、不能有所虛僞、其或自己不能塡寫者、得託諸局員代書、由保戶署名蓋章、局員對塡寫內容、例守秘密、而不虞或致外洩、能保戶於投保之時、對於投保聲請書、爲不確實之塡寫、則日後查明、按章對所投保之契約爲無效、雖發生死亡事故、亦不能領取保險金、保戶誠不可不加以注意、</p>
<p>保費務須依期繳納</p>
<p>保費應儘能力按月依期繳納、保費定爲每月收取一次、保戶自向儲匯局窗口緻納、或由局派員依期收取、均能照辦、但爲節省費用計、均盼保戶務須按月依期緻付、若經過二個月之猶豫期間、尙不緻納時、則所訂契約、便即失效、契約失效、則保與與保險人（即儲匯局）雙方皆受相當之損失、更因保戶當經濟困難之時、即正需要保險最多之時、所以始終維持契約效力者、必能達到如願而償之圓滿希望、</p>
<p>發展經濟促進繁榮</p>
<p>簡易壽險、爲政府所創辦、以扶助國民經濟之損失、巳如上述、惟此項制度之推行、重在人民與政府之切實合作、因爲人民之加入者愈多、則此項集團力量愈擴大、而基礎愈益鞏固、現在辦理伊始、所望社會熱心人士、廣爲宣傳、對於自己家人親友、勸導及早加入、以期均能得到均實可靠之經濟保障、同時保險思想愈普及、則普通毒險事業之進行、亦愈順利、以於發展國民經濟、促進社會繁榮、，均俾益甚大、凡欲保險者、可以電話通知郵政儲金滙業局、以便隨時派員接洽也、</p>

<h3>上海棉布業槪况</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之四）</p>
<p>一　沿革</p>
<p>我國幅員廣大。人口衆多，棉布之消費數量，幾與食糧相埒。故自古以來。「男耕女織一，分工合作，衣食始能無憂，有淸一代，家庭手工織布，各地極爲發達。而江蘇之土布，尤馳名遐邇。除自給外，且遠銷歐美日本諸國。逮各國機織棉布勃興。我國土布，不僅海外銷塲銳减，而歐美機織棉布，反得暢銷我國。舊式手工土布，遂漸被淘汰。咸同以後，上海商業日盛·各國棉布。咸聚散於斯。經營斯業最早者，當推北京路之同昌（開設於咸豐元年）南京路之同春祥，公館馬路之日新盛（均設於同治八年）三汴涇橋之元泰晋記（光緒元年）。老閘橋之陳榮興（光緒九年），肇嘉路之永和祥，（光緒二十四年），公館馬路之日新增（宣統二年），均屬歷中悠久，資本雄厚者，爾後棉布莊號，風起雲湧。僉欲於買賣價格差異之間。博取若干利潤成佣金，然而有識之士，鑒終專事販賣洋布。終非上策，爲杜塞漏巵起見，乃於光緒十六年設立上海洋布局，是爲我國機器織布廠之嚆矢，此後各地機製布廠，接踵而起，銳意經營。不遺餘力。顧以設備欠佳。術技落後，所織之布，無論品質色澤，均難與外貨抗衡，故每年洋布進口，初未稍减，恒居進口貨之第一位。致上海棉布市塲，長期爲外貨所壟繼，然其勢力之消長，今昔頗有不同。大概初期以美貨最占優勢，不十年，英貨起而代之。經之營之，勢力日大，而民國元年至民國五年，營業最爲發達，是爲西洋貨之全盛時代。迨歐戰爆發，英國不遑東顧，英貨又爲日貨所排擠，民國六年至民國十四年，爲日貨之全盛時代。嗣因「五卅」慘案發生，國人紛起抵貨，日貨大受打擊。國產布廠，乘機抬頭，故民十六至民二十此五年間。爲國貨之全盛時代。雖坯布仍多仰給於東隣，不無「改頭換面」之嫌，然因限於資本與技術，要亦無可如何也。逮「九一八」瀋陽變起，抵貨舊事重提，國產棉布乃又得推進一步，品質日見精良，在上海市塲，始占有相當地位。舉凡舶來品之粗布，細布，標布曁粗細斜紋等，均有國貨代替。僅羽緞，洋紗，羅格，府綢·及花色布等，國人猶未能精製耳。同時滬市棉布業公會會員莊號，巳以國布爲營業之重心，外貨進口之數字，亦日見减少，不可謂非差强人意之事也。</p>

<p>行銷上海之棉布，品類甚繁，多至數百種，且有日見增加之趨勢。然若以出品地域爲標準而大別之，則不外西洋貨，東洋貨及本廠貨三種·西洋貨凡英·美·法·德，俄·荷·等國出品均屬之·東洋貨則純爲日本製造，至本廠貨係包含國內外廠與華廠出品而言，三者之中，品質以西洋貨爲最精，但成本不若東洋貨與本廠貨之低廉，此即十餘年來西洋貨日就衰落之原因。若就棉布之色澤而言，則可分白貨與花色貨二種·白貨又有本色市布，組布，細布，粗斜紋布，細斜紋布，標布之別，國產棉織廠。類能製造。花色貨則凡屬染色之布，均名花色貨，種類頗多，除少數國產染織廠可以染製外。大部份爲舶來品。滬市最暢銷之舶來花色貨，共有十八種。（一）印花布。（二）染色洋標布。（三）泰西緞。（四）洋紅布。（五）絨布。（六）棉法蘭絨。（七）棉羽綢。（八）洋紗。（九）縐布。（十）府綢。（十一）棉羽綢。（十二）柳條布。（十三）無花柳條布。（十四）彩色布。（十五）棉剪絨。（十六）席法絨。（十成）縐地洋紗·（十八）棉羽綾。再就棉布之營業分野而言，則有棉布業，廠布業。土布業之別。營業界限分明。各有公會組織，歷來上海習慣，大致經營棉布業者，可兼營廠布土布。經營廠布土布者，則不能兼營棉布。故本篇所述，僅及於棉布一業，至廠布土布兩業之調查，容當俟諸異日也。</p>
<p>三　織造程序</p>
<p>自上海洋布高以機器織布以來。我國棉布之生產方法，大起變化。由木機而鐵機，由脚踏機而電力機，以機械之日新月異。出品之改進亦至速·其織造程序。可分爲三部言之·第一部及準備工程。A絡經。法將紗絡成筒。使織布時不致發生鬆弛及斷頭之弊，B整理，將紗筒置於整理架上。然後引導紗錢，經過後扣，收集成適當之寬度。D漿紗，使紗綫感受極勻密之漿糊，而能堅挺爽直。D穿綜，即將已漿之紗，穿人綜眼內。E穿扣，將已穿過粽眼之紗頭，復穿於扣齒之內，F捲緯，即將緯紗搖頓紗筒上。經緯旣備。乃開始第二部織造工程。A開口，即分開經紗爲上午二片。使作成一口。以便持緯之梭，得以通其間·B投梭，繼開口之後，須令梭子自機之一側穿過梭口，以衝入機之他側，因之得吐緯一縷，交入經紗之間。C打緯，由梭子織人一縷緯紗後，即須向內扣緊。使與前後密接。乃能織成布疋。送出與捲取，隨織造之進行，自經軸上送出適當長之緯紗，且維持適當之緊度。謂之送出。迨識成後。又須以適當之速度。逐漸捲之於木棍上。是名捲取。此外一梭之緯紗用盡或切斷時。機即自停。須用人力繼接。若裝置爲自動機。到能自行繼接。無須停機。再若精製者。每織布機若干。上端置噴霧機一架。使布身不因緊綳而乾脆。織布旣竟。乃施第三部整理工程。A縫布。將各機織成之布，縫合連續，以便整染·B燒毛，法以兩紫銅片燒去布之正反兩面織毛。以顯其花紋。而漿糊之不良性藥品亦可發現。C水洗，用水洗去織物之已經燒毛後剩餘布上之污物。C脫水，將布裝上去水機，軋去水分，再上烘乾機烘乾。E擴布，織物易於縐折，乃以綳布機，拉闊尺幅。F平面，即經砑光機砑光，電光機電光。織造工作。至是方告畢事，若須漂白，隨入漯白室蒸溜洗滌。漂白後或染色或印花，均無不可也。（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（一一四）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>南恩仰起頭來一看，忽然見得太陽已經下去，喊道：「還了得，時候眞不早了。立刻就導走，要不然他們要跑走了。」</p>
<p>「大概一個鐘頭以前我聽見一陣角聲；也許他們是為我們吹的，」羅勃説道，其時他的嚮導正攀援以登陡峭的小山，他便在後面疲憊地跟着。</p>
<p>「在那一個方面；」他以一個污黑的指頭點着，可是完全是一個錯誤的方向。</p>
<p>「讓我們走那條路去和他們會合罷，」南恩說了，便旋轉身來，他們的小脚步開始奔過那些叢薄，覺得有些惶恐，因爲這裏有那麽多的小徑，她竟不能記得她來時的路由了。</p>
<p>於是他們再是越陌度阡走着，有時停下來一聽有無角聲，然而終是徒然，因爲聽到的却只是母牛夜歸時的長鳴罷了。</p>
<p>南恩走到一處短垣，便坐了下來一瞭望，問道，「我不記得看見過那一堆的石頭，—你看見過嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不記得什麽，我只要回家去，」羅勃說時聲音裏帶着些微顫，南恩聽了，便以臂去圍住了他，從牆上舉起他來，又輕輕放他到地下去，并擺出她最能幹的語氣說道：</p>
<p>「我眞是走得頂頂快了，寶，不要哭，我們到了大路，我會抱你走的。」</p>
<p>「大路在那裏呢？」羅勃說了，擦擦他的眼晴一看它究竟在那裏。</p>
<p>「在那大樹旁邊。你不看見這是內達爬上去跌下來的一株麼？」</p>
<p>「正是呢。也許他們還在等我們；我倒喜歡坐了車子回家的，—你不嗎？羅勃一路跋涉向那大草原的盡頭時，心裏的得意映到臉上來了。</p>
<p>「不，我奪可走的，」南恩同答道，覺得她是不得不走，所以還是死心塌地準備着的好。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>行至中途，忽然下起雨來，於是上面有淋漓的雨，下面有泥濘的路，頓時阻止我的進行了；受着經濟的束縛，人力車夫又那樣高抬車價，傲視着作鄙夷之笑。我受着這重重的壓迫，終於鼓起勇氣，衣履汚濕了，又值得什麼？在淋漓的雨下，濘滑的路上，向前走去，結果也就到了我的目的地了！</p>
<p>由是我想：今天這一點小小的事件，却是給與我一個很大的認識，凡是受着世道崎嶇人情冷暖的威逼，而徘徊十字路口的靑年們，要知道現在解决生活問題，而去干求於貴者之門，加以援救，可是他們會高抬身價，目空無人的，最多給你個獰笑而已！</p>
<p>我們受了奚落以後，更當激起我們奮勉的心，抱着破釜沈舟的犧牲精神！向前奮鬥。雖然像衣履受風雨泥濘侵襲而汚濕，但目的地終於到達了啊，所以君子貴求諸己。</p>
<h3>小神仙</h3>
<p>— 采黃</p>
<p>「小神仙，」原來是一個在江湖道上，落魄的孩子；問它的年紀，還不過十二歲。唉！你看它是小小身材，像學校裏出來的學童，它實在已能够『自食其力』呢！</p>
<p>每日，手中托了一隻鉛皮小匣，在各處茶寮中，兜些小生意；它的小匣上面寫著『小神仙』的牌子，匣裏齊齊整整，藏着許多紙卷；向人說：『阿要拆字，』很和氣，而且笑容可掬的，使人覺得不會討厭；前幾天晚上在塔蔭，某君見它，就掏出銅圓八枚，拈了兩個字，去試他的本領，究竟有沒有一些小道理？第一個拈得『佳』字，第二個又拈得『一』字，『小神仙』拿來細細一看。顚了一顚，頭說道：『先生要問何事，』某君曰，『問問這段婚事，現在到底怎樣』？『小神仙』答道：『這時候，恰如待闕鴛鴦一樣，且不出數天，完成美滿的良緣了：』說罷，就去一塊石版上寫了一首詞：需要照紅妝寳炬燒，形也苗條，影也苗條，魂兒眞個許郎銷，愛也今宵，怕也今宵。十幅流蘇護翠翹，推也含嬌，就也含嬌，明朝春意透眉梢，郎也慵描，妾也慵描。</p>
<p>寫罷，『小神仙』對某君道：『先生問的事，就在雙十節那一天，執了一枝石筆，將『佳』字旁添了一個一個『佳』字，下邊又加了一個『又』字，『一』字的中間，豎下一筆，成了『十』字，說：這兩個字，恰符這首詞的開頭，那末：他倆的團圓日子，必定在雙十節了。某君初起還不很相信，以為『這小孩子可憐，吾因他伶俐，姑試他一下，倘你眞當他是神仙，唉！不是迷信過甚麼？豈知某君返家，見他的親戚果有請柬已在案上，幷是吉日，確是在雙十節一天；於是大家都以爲奇，而『小神仙』近已不見，據說離嘉定到別個碼頭去了。</p>
<h3>綠毛龜</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>前年吾邑西北超岸鄉陸藍田家，蓄有「白龜」，已歷三世。目為致富之靈物，珍秘弗洩。一日，忽失所在，家人知非吉兆，嗣陸果以被綁聞；及案破，其物復出如故，傳為奇事。又見報載龍華鄉，某獲一「紅龜」，長僅二寸許，與普通者絕異，因其背甲徘紅，呈有光澤，脊前現太極圖，形五尾，性靈敏，爬行甚疾，惟此一「紅」一「白」之龜，俱未寓目，不過得諸傳聞耳：昨在某市茶寮前，見荷擔售金魚者，玻璃缸中，置一「綠龜」，驟視之，宛如翡翠，浮沈水中，煞是可觀；惟殼上附有毛至長，詢之，曰，此非龜之本色，乃毛之采耳；」大不逾五寸，而茸茸然，若不容盆盎，其價極昂，竟標至非五六元，不肯脫手者，亦云貴已。</p>
<p>余復問其若何飼養，方得至此，曰，「每日以蜓蚰切細，投諸水中，儻值嚴寒時，防其冰凍，卽須起水，藏於匣內，使勿受外界冷氣，得保溫度，自能不死；迨至春初，或淸明前後，復置之於水，其毛仍能放開，而色依然不變，仍至間有金綫，而底甲白晳，一如象牙，脊上具有三稜狀，顧不宜大，而以小為尚，最極者，祗與五銖錢等，特不易致，茍得蓄之，不特能避蛇蝎之毒，而且可防火災，」言次，眞有居為奇貨之概，以無購之者，卒擔荷而去；頃之，有茶客某翁笑曰，「此龜　天生者，乃人造也；」衆請其故，白，「使以龜之甲上，日塗搗爛之薑汁，并弗使着水，久之，則生靑苔，然後養於水中，漸漸引長，而飄浮滿甕矣；』是說，余雖未經試騐，不敢深信，而言非無理，爰濡筆述之，以騐閱者。</p>
<h3>怪姓彙鈔</h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>自從本刋披露許多記載怪姓的文字后，作者以其頗饒趣味，當卽着意搜羅；每閱報章，遇到人名中有不常見的姓氏，輒以片紙，將其姓名略歷，鈔錄出來，迄於今日，得若干人，茲為揭藥於後。</p>
<p>「帖」勵生，春間因了墜馬而死的財部秘書。「恭」光春，它是一個著匪，橫行膠東，業已伏法。「隴」體要，新就無錫縣長。「螘」壽全，現在上海工部局中充任醫師。「權」某玉，新近到過上海的女飛行家。「忽」善萃，上海文廟路警察所的警士。「印」心源，前充江蘇嘉定縣第三區的保甲編查員。「侶」朋是陶知行先生把他介紹到各地演講「小先生制」的小先生。「幸」光齊，訓練總監部派到嘉定視察過的視察員。「資」耀華，從前商界聞人楊敦甫先生追悼會的發起人。「抗」定安，上海市政府舉辦第三屆集團結婚的婚禮職員。「承」談安，他是中國鍼灸學研究社社長。「渠」達成，現任河南印花菸酒稅局長。「從」永祥，上海虹口捕房探員。「羗」梓生，救濟王彬彥破產委員會的碾米業公會代表。「彝」子為，前曾充任江蘇丹陽縣公安局長。「后」萬安，上海律師公會的律師。「秉」農山，中國科學社的生物研究所所長。「孝」遇春，在天津法租界執行律務。「弘」傘，現任河南查派辦事處主任。「粟」柏蘭，此次全運會中的女運動員。「石」福全，上海市，公和樂體育會的新任職員。</p>
<p>又廣東多「找姓，雲南有「剝」姓；而作者的朋好中，有一「胥」姓。我邑公安　的警長中，則有「生」姓。據它自稱。係大將軍年羹堯後裔，當年氏族減時，其幼子某乘隙　出，遂將厥姓年字向上出頭，改作生姓，以示死裏逃生，而期出頭有日！因其很有寓意，故附誌及之。</p>
<h3>如入無人之境！</h3>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十一回　婉藝任人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲</p>
<p>志前向他笑着，還沒有答復出來這一句話呢。只聽隔最子哄咚一聲，好像小有人用力在倚子上坐下去，椅子　背，便打了板壁一卜響，接着那婦人重聲道：你不用得嚇成這個樣子，闖出了什麼禍事來，有你太太出來負責，不關你的事。那局長很和緩的答道：算我怕你了。我又沒作　，你還生什麼氣？那婦人道；雖是沒作聲，你那種樣子，也很是看看。這一句話之後，那邊屋子裏寂然，什麼聲音都沒有。先是擦火柴聲，隨着茶杯倒茶聲，接着茶杯碰桌面聲，還是那婦人開口說：我要喝凉的，你和我叫茶房來。這位嫂子，你坐下，你那小脚，那久站得住？於是那位局長的叫茶房聲，接二連三的發出來。茶房很平和的問話聲，就出來了。太太說：你和我拿幾瓶荷蘭水來。茶房說：辣水沒有，只有辣椒油。局長說：嗐！要汽水。茶房說：呵！汽水。平常是一塊錢兩瓶，現在恐怕……太太說：你拿來就是了，一塊錢一瓶我也要。茶房說：不，恐怕現在鄭州還沒有來　。要到端午節以後，才有得來。太太說：你去罷，沒有還說什麼？回來，這裏有什麼水果沒有？茶房道：現在也少有呀，除非是梨。太太說：就是梨也好，一塊錢能買多少？茶房說：一二斤吧？太太說：喂！不要裝傻，拿兩塊錢出來，交給茶房去買梨，於是洋元噹啷　了幾下，茶房由那邊走出去了。接着他又說：喂！你也出去，我和這位大嫂說幾句話。局長說？你只管說你的，我不打岔就是了。太太說：你不打岔也不行，反正我不要你在屋子裏。你走不走呢？說到這裏，他的語音，可就重的多了。（三七一）</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>西北行</h3>
<p>— 王穀</p>
<p>—黃河與潼關—</p>
<p>火車過了鄭州，便奔進了荒漠的國土。滿眼看不見一株樹，甚而至於一華小草。江南的曠野，那滿地都是綠的風味，這裏是大概想都不曾想過的！黃，黑，焦枯，是他的顏色和形容。點綴鐵路使得客人不陷於單調枯燥的唯一把戲，便是接連不斷的山洞，穿不完的山洞，一個，一個，又一個，在剛剛出了第一個洞，還沒鑽進第二個洞的時候，右手邊，遠遠的現出一條耀着日光發出亮晶晶的帶子，躱躱閃閃地，從土山的缺角裏，從平原低陷的邊綫裏，湧入到旅客的眼簾內來；這就是不知害死了幾千萬人的黃河！</p>
<p>「黃河喲！」車上有人發出似乎欣喜又似乎感動的聲音。我自然高興，居然看見這個怪物了　於是爬在窓子口，伸長着頸項朝右邊望，想把它看個仔細。火車是做美的，漸漸地走靠到貢河的邊岸上來了。這一下，我纔曉得它的命名，是絲毫不錯的？黃，黃！黃喲！眞不愧喚做黃河！假使要更眞實地說：紅河都是可以的！它的水，渾濁得比紹興酒的酒脚子還來得富於紅赭的色素。浪是大的，潮是急的，滿眼一片黃色的汪洋，滾滾地，向前奔去，再看它的河床，從邊岸推測下去，恐怕要比堤這邊的平原土地還要高！怪物之所以成為怪物，所以被人尊稱為黃禍，一點都不偶然，一點也不奇怪。在那時候，邊岸上正有不少莊稼漢，忙忙的挑泥修堤。就他們所修的，至多不到一丈闊；假使怪物高興發個威，决個把口頑頑，我想這是應毌庸議的不成問題。</p>
<p>點綴在黃河堤岸上的風景，很值得說一說的，就是上古時代的遺跡！穴居！尚在人間。</p>
<p>這種野獸型的住宅，是檢一座小土山，不大變遷的，土質黏紉的。挖了一個大洞，那麼，便是家了；娶老婆，生兒子，一切的一切，都活動在這裏面。我在看見這種「人洞」左一個右一偭，遍設在黃河邊岸所有較平坦的土山上的時候，心裏有種說不出來的難過。可是聽一個河南南部的老鄉說。「這是天堂呵！冬天暖，夏天凉，百年，八十年，無需修理。最好的一點：當有兵災的時候，把洞口一塞，便可以保住性命了。」哦！原來是這樣的！中國人眞能忍耐呵！土洞是天堂呵！土洞是天堂呵！」我什麼都說不出了。</p>
<p>火車在河邊上走，有時候，道台（鐵道的路基）只有十幾英尺寬，而高倒有好幾丈，車子是那麼發狂的顚簸，搖擺！右邊又緊靠着萬馬奔騰的急流，眞有些敎人感覺是在和生命做捉迷藏的遊戲。然而中國人是軔性的，大膽的，誰都沒呌聲「啊呀」！就這樣一直溜到潼難了。</p>
<p>潼關是個有名的地方，而它的像貌，也是和上面所說的差不多；不過人洞「更多，土山史大，更高，綿亘幾十里，重疊七八層，古人所謂「一夫當關萬夫莫過一的險要，大概便是潸些土山的迥旋錯粽的形勢而巳罷。另外有點令人又驚異，又歡喜的，是有了樹木了；尤其是活像一根根大鷄毛帚似的白楊樹，排班的站着，挺直高聳的白桿子，配着凝重深沈的綠葉，很有點古之高士的意味，想起郭沫若的詩，「明月何皎皎，白楊聲蕭簫。」我看那樣子，即使沒有風，也的確有此蕭蕭之感的。</p>

<h3>紗花　實銷不斷　紗市一時不易回落</h3>
<p>紗市始疲繼堅、局勢依然良好、蓋以現紗客銷有發展模樣、川帮辦胃亦開、致人心愈挺、但多數同業因其市價巳達高境、音態傾向拋空、然棉市殊昂、金融界在遠月一味拖進、關閉大批額子、堅不放髪云、</p>
<p>標紗近月</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月微見上昇、因上月餘氣未熄、且海外棉業消息轉好、但拍至二槃、聞公債下落、塲中賣風略盛而跌、三盤因原棉堅硬、重復回上、迨至收盤平疲、結果各月比上日收盤價、各月均跌一。三·四·六角、午後開盤平淡、然拍至二三盤、以棉花脚地堅固、並聞現紗交易發展、買氣重振、收盤由疲而轉堅、結果近月比上午牧盤價跌一·三·角、遠漲一·一·四角、查賣出錦昌六百五十包、賡豐一千〇五十包、愼記四百包、元一二千四百五十包、泰昌九包、永昌一千二百包、同和四百包、信誠四百五十包、買進同孚五百包、大孚九百五十包、大豐一千四百包、長豐一千六百包、永大七百五十包、愼訊五百包、振大四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>出口交易不絕　棉花脚地穩固　同業雖傾向拋出外商則續來購進</h3>
<p>棉市仍堅、形勢殊佳、蓋以現棉出口交易未絕、美商美安、印商福家在上月收進之棉、有裝運海外之風說、於是人心更挺、在本月份繼續拉進、所以市勢被其愈抽愈緊、惟一般同行致傾向拋出云、</p>
<p>標花午後長和扒空</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因上日大漲後、引起獲利者了結而回跌五分至二角半、但拍至二、三、盤、外商續來購進、紗市回好、致棉市更緊、迨至收盤回平、結果各月比上日收盤價參差不齊、出入五分至一角半、午後開盤市態仍挺、畏和又來扒空、且美國棉田减縮繼續四年、於是市况愈俏、漲風又起結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角至二角、查賣出大孚一千擔、通記一千七百擔、合興三千二百擔、泰昌一千五百擔、長豐二千三百擔、源興昌四千擔、畏和一千九百擔、賡豐二千二百擔、潤康一千擔、信誠二千八百擔、買進通記一千七百擔、裕大一千五百擔、大昌成二千四百擔、潤康一千擔、信誠一千九百擔、瑞源千四百續、元一一千八白擔、長和五千二百擔、一日聞最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我國古物大出風頭</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>前在上海公開展覽後，由英巡洋艦「蘇福克』號運載赴英的我國古物，已於上月二十八日起，由英國王家美術院主持之下，在倫敦白林頓宮正式揭幕。第一日參觀者逾三千人，會塲呈空前未有的盛况。據守門者語人：『余從未見美術展覽會之參觀老若是衆多，誠罕舉也」。外國人士至會參觀者，為數更多，會塲中可聞歐洲各國的語言。公認為中國美術品專家約四十人，由歐洲各大國報館特派赴會，撰述展覽會的情形。英皇偕后及皇族，亦蒞會參觀。前一日舉行預展，英國與他國重要人物，皆爭先赴會。許多學者正設法擬在會塲中作長期的研究工作。巴黎某大著名衣飾肆，且已參用我國的式樣色彩，製成新衣多襲。觀者皆稱讚古物的精美，及布置的周到，謂在英國美術意境方需要有新補充時，這次展覽，將在英國美術上，大有影響。聞展覽會至明年三月，始行閉幕。</p>
<p>外人心目中的中國，是辮子，小足和鴉片。這次古物在倫敦公開展覽，可算大出風頭。過去三千五百年間我國歷朝的美術品，陳列一堂，供人參觀，得歐洲各國人士的驚羨，實為我國最大的榮譽。</p>
<p>我們聽到我國古物在英倫受人如此歡迎，眞覺高興萬分。他們赴會參觀的踴躍，趕熱鬧者有之，抱好奇心者有之，為參考研究者亦有之。總之，我們以為因這次古物的展覽，外人或能改變一向對中國的觀念，明白中國除辮子，小足和鴉片而外，亦有其珍貴的古文化存在。</p>
<p>雖然，我們在高興之餘，至少應有二種的認識。第一，我國的古代文化，的確放過異彩，足令我們誇耀世界。但這是已往的光榮。我們要保持這種光榮，不應如一班復古論者的態度，一味抱殘守缺，不思進取。我們須加倍的努力，發揮光犬之，使我國的固有文化，能不朽於人間。第二，文化是進步的，隨人類的生活形式而趣遷。我國欲立足於現時代，單靠古文化是不够的，必需有新的文化，才能與各國爭生存。故我們對於我國舊文化之不適於今日者，須有接棄的决心，對於外來文化之有益於我民族者，應有接受的勇氣。這是目前我國一般文化運動者應有的覺悟。</p>
<p>最後，我們要提醒國人，我國這次運英展覽的古物，現下在倫敦大走紅運，從前却曾經歷過一番小刦。大家想還記得古物南運的一段故事，這數千件古物，是在平津危急的當兒，搬到上海來的。曾幾何時，古物正在外國展覽，北方又呈動搖，眞敎人發生無限的威慨。說不定他日古物運載回國之後？這些古物的故鄉，已失去它原來的風光。</p>
<h3>膽怯的人</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>雲大跟今天的天氣一樣的溫柔，把頭髮梳得那麼光滑而漂亮的，拿着他愛讀的柴霍甫的小說集，他打算在飯館裏吃過了午飯，就到許久沒有去過的匯山公園去散步，因為，他是愛着菊花的，在初冬的溫柔的太陽光底下，他可以深深地吸着艷麗的菊花所噴出來的韾香。就好像他沉醉在他的思慕着的戀人的懷抱裏一樣。他愛菊花就是因為他的懷戀着的女兒的名字是秋菊呀！</p>
<p>「然而，懷戀着的女兒呢？好像在夢裏似的呀！」</p>
<p>他常常都是這樣太息着，而且常常地想着假如她肯屈低了她的驕傲性而來看他的時候一種說不出來的愉快，或者是在偶然間碰到她的時候的一種特異的味兒。他常常做着幻想有時為了幻想着懷戀着的秋菊的悒鬱與痛苦的樣子而失眠了。</p>
<p>可是，很好的機會來了，用不着他到公園裏去看靜寂的菊花，他一個思念着的秋菊。突然間在他的眼晴裏出現了。</p>
<p>那時，他剛剛在飯館裏吃着飯，突然的，一個穿着黑色的大衣的女兒打着館前跑過去，而且是有意地把臉兒向着他望了一望，但是，等到他斷定她就是一個懷戀着的秋菊的時候，她已經跑得遠遠了。他的心裏想着：『不錯，大約她已知道我在這兒吃飯的，也許是同樣地思念我，所以有意地打着這兒經過的。但是，她是多麼驕傲呀！頭也不回地跑了，而且跑得那麼扭抳的。」但是，難道他也不害羞地追上去，像捕捉小鳥兒一樣的拖着她嗎？而且，他跟她分離了已有半年了，這半年間雖然他永遠不會忘記她的迷人的眼珠子，有趣而愛撩人的小嘴唇。可是，難道地會原諒他，而且亳無痛恨地安慰他嗎？他想着，他苦悶着，起先打算去看芳艷的菊花的念頭就泡影地消逝了。而在抑鬱的心頭裏廻盪着的一個淸瘦影子，一個只驕傲地向他正在吃飯的嘴巴一望的臉孔。他沈痛地瞪着還朱吃完的飯和菜，他忽然拿着柴霍甫的小說集，奔出了飯館：</p>
<p>「她故意來挑撥我，這小鬼，我還吃什麼飯呵！我要追上去，我要鼓着勇一氣，我要向她訴說半年來懷戀着她的痛苦，我要……」</p>
<p>他的心焦急而痛苦的，跑出了飯館的門前，在那擾雜的馬路上望着，跑着，有点儿昏了而且是疯了似的，他自己咒詛着：</p>
<p>「秋菊呵，你到那兒去了呢？你眞的不要我嗎？你好很心哪！」</p>
<p>他奔着，像他這樣的穿着齊整而動人的靑年人在路上奔跑着，更令人家注目地望着他，也許以為他瘋了，但是，他却不管，他的心裏只有一個目的：「把秋菊追上了，我該要說我是怎麼樣愛着她的，而且，我是怎麼樣的失了平衡的心情，簡直是瘋了，就是她不肯表示她是愛我的，也許她還在愛我的，總之，我該要那麼地做，這是她自己跑來的呀！」他咒詛着，拐了一個灣，已是保定路，在疏疏落落的行人道上可以看到秋菊的背影，姍姍地，還有點好像小孩子，風吹着她的黑髮，風吹着她的黑色的大衣，這時候，她把臉孔回過來望了一望他。知道他果然瘋了似的追上來，她就有意撩他一樣的轉了一個灣，從昆明路向西邊去了。他的心裏害怕了起來，也許她不高興他追上去的，而且她跑得那麼快，就好像不理睬他一樣，但是，她為什麼又不住的回頭來望他呢？他全不知怎麼的才好，心裏痛苦起來。</p>
<p>但是，他愛她，他又怕她，他的心靈裏的苦惱的影子在互相地攻擊着，他雖然不敢跑到她的臉前跟她握手，但是，他就好像鐵質而被她的磁性吸引着一樣，他雖然在駡着自己：「膽怯的人呀！你旣然沒有勇氣在一個女兒而且又是你所愛着的秋菊前面去，却跟在她的後面，不是你自己的醜態而且表示沒有一點用塲嗎？也許，她在駡你笑你，而且恨着你呢！也許她因為你沒有勇氣投到她的懷抱裏而只跟着地兜圈子，她簡直笑你是個卑鄙的人呢！」這樣！他就明白了自己全是偉大的短篇小說家柴霍甫所描寫裏的人物了！他眞的要駡着自己了！然而，他雖然在駡着自己，但却不能馬上就離開她跑了，仙眞的不能不的在遠遠的角落裏跟着她，她也不住地回頭來望他，知道他還依然是個膽怯的人，她有時回頭苦笑地，有時故意跑慢了一點，有時又跑得很快的。他簡直是個白痴的在跟着她兜了許多圈子，從大連灣路到周家嘴路，拐到公平路，兜了一個圈子的回到公平路，到岳州路，他以為她準會搭十八路無軌電車的，可是，她却在這個地方碰到了三四個女兒們，她只望了一下他，他在遠角裏膽怯而痛苦地，簡面軟了一樣的要倒在地面，遠遠地望着她們天眞地笑着跑了。她那時眞是痛苦而難過地回頭來望他，他也很淸楚地望得到，她淸瘦而痛苦的，全不是半年前跟他親切地談笑的時候的秋菊了，她們一直到了兆豐路的一間學校裏消失了影子，而他也失望地在馬路上徘徊着，簡直的在駡着他是個沒有用的膽怯的人，但是，他知道自己不是在女人的前面的時候是勇敢有餘。</p>
<p>悲痛地，在十八路的無軌電車上面迷着眼珠子：</p>
<p>「還是到公園裏去看菊花吧！苦惱的！柴霍甫早就把我描寫在他的小說裏了。但是，我是愛她，無論她楚怎麼的在使我難過呵！</p>
<h3>高田馬塲之窟</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>初到東京，有些朋友一見面，便要問：銀座去過沒有？或者是：日本橋呢？新宿呢？淺草呢？可是，我老像全無其事的，都不曾玩過啊。</p>
<p>惟有新宿，却給朋友拉去一遭了：然而，大都市的熱流裏的，艷治的容顏，交鳴的車聲，呼喘的煤烟，除使我略感麻木外，尚沒有嗅到點兒新的滋味。不過，也算聽了一些留學生們的新見：</p>
<p>「這兒，多好，一切都很有秩序，街上述乞丐都見不到一個，和中國，簡直是大淵之別。」</p>
<p>「……呵，……就連窮人也看不到……」</p>
<p>這些我不很淸楚，只是，較窒息的故國，感着「白由」一些兒吧。似乎有這點直覺的意識。</p>
<p>畢竟是應該觀光的，於新居的異國，文明的異國。我偏喜山水，至少也須是臨水或傍山，可以呼幾口淸爽的空氣，也使身心略覺寬曠自由些。所以朋友便偕我高田馬塲去。是一個小山頭；但在東京已經算足很高了，據說是一個好玩的去處哩。</p>
<p>「站在山頭上，可以見到日本的富士山呢？」</p>
<p>雖然山頭不大不高，但見着靑靑的顏色，我也便高興。山頭，和左右上下，人很多，特別是小孩子更紛紛走動着。因為快十年不曾爬過山，登臨山頭，要以穿着皮鞋，爬下斜滑的小山嶺，最初似有點懷疑。但旁邊的去路甚小，只好滑下去。</p>
<p>舉目四望，尋了好一回，富士山未見，朋友用日本話問問日本人，仍無着落。大概是，美麗的富士山，今天給雲霧遮住了吧！令人有點兒失望。</p>
<p>再環首注顧，有點索然。遊人們是走動着，站着望望而已，亦沒有什麼可以凝神諦聽的音曲。</p>
<p>好玩的高田馬塲，便是這樣嗎？</p>
<p>我催同伴歸去了。默然而行，聞到馬糞味。同伴才給我解釋。當十年前，他到東京時，高田馬塲這帶地方，還是荒地呢！附近的大馬路，繁華的商店，是以後新造的。這山頭下，從前是練馬塲。言下有些今昔之感。我呢，仍是乏味。不耐煩的叫聲：</p>
<p>「下去吧！不如快點歸去，時也近黃昏了。」</p>
<p>但打了一轉，却忽見山側冷落的荒亂的草木裏，有衣衫襤褸的人，有似畜類走獸的居處的山窟，草窩。急定神細看。大小排過約莫七八個。古人的穴居</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>野處，却於此重現了。</p>
<p>蓬亂的草，樹枝葉的底下，是窟門，裏面並不怎樣深，隱約只見一片陰暗。淸楚可辨的是，黑髮散亂如衰草的人頭，或者一個上身，衣衫是黑白破洞不一，或是雙可怕的赤脚，露在窟邊。</p>
<p>二個頭髮特別多和蓬亂的頭，是女人的頭。裏面還有蠕動的東西，那是小孩呢。簡直有些怕人。他們是白天裏在睡着了，還是只有躱在這樣的家呢？和禽獸有多大分別？他們的生活。</p>
<p>同伴竟踏着小徑，排開籐木，步步逼去。</p>
<p>第五個窟前吧！有一個老人慢慢的在動着。他的窟前放着許多亂七八糟的，像從圾圾堆拾來的雜物，窟內是空空了。同伴上去問他，我嗅到一股難受氣味却退了幾步。</p>
<p>這是到日本後的第一次出遊。</p>

<p>春日風和日正長。春風吹動百花香。美滿春光花似歸。素蘭不欲賞春光。病梅悶坐沉香閣。迫喚李花掩綠窗。可憐碧桃常愴嘆。金菊思親淚滿眶。我想昔年長春富。先君折桂姓飄香。紫袍錦帶君親賜。詰封高貢玉蘭堂。薔薇廳上排香案。肚丹亭前謝上蒼。誰知椿萓身染病。不幸相繼喪洛陽。可憐當芝無手足。殊蘭哭得斷肝腸。那時是。落花撩亂家無主。苦懷千金秋海棠。梨花憔悴嬌軀瘦。玉簪不帶　梳妝。日來不思茶縻食。夜來香恍惚在牙床。虞美人病入芙蓉帳。瑞香使女送茶湯。杜鵑口吐鮮紅血。秋葵侍奉在閩房。幸喜黃姑來到此。見芭蕉不覺淚汪汪。輕啟櫻桃將我喚。深恐株籘病延長。喚冬青快把醫師請。荷花公子定樂方。原來茉莉傷肝症。要用那佛手片。花檳榔。玫瑰芍藥前藥湯芍藥山丹來服下。鳯仙略覺病安康。凌荷花見常滴思親淚。繡球夢內哭爺娘。搭桐落葉扶柩歸故土。帶雪梅花轉門牆，祠堂造在杏花塘。</p>
<p>邢瑞亭釵頭鳳</p>
<p>惠靈（一三八〇）下午九時至十時</p>
<p>開篇「江湖賣藝歌」</p>
<p>天朗氣淸趁晚凉。街頭慢步樂徜徉。行到那，廣塲一片平如鏡。忽聽得，　鼓聲喧在一傍。閒人駐足圍繞看。見到那，雜要的東西歷亂橫。刀槍劍。狗猴羊。賣藝的人兒到有二三雙。無多片刻鑼聲止。那賣藝人。打恭作揖來說端詳。他言道。吾們是。訪友出門來到此。山東村內是老鄉。在家靠父母。出門靠四方。小技未精聊博笑。請諸君。資助些須要樂解囊。表演之間容未到。還祈格外要包荒。說話完時忙退後。小孩子好戲正開塲。觔斗翻來團團轉。拳風飛去弱勝强。桌上斜鋪三脚凳。反身倒垂去飲茶湯。做過一門換一套。猴兒好戲又登塲。往來馳騁騎羊背。宛然是戰塲將軍一般樣。做完一門換一套。女娘兒的好戲冉上塲。飛行繩上如平地。進退疾徐儘不妨。看客們是。一回兒急。一回兒慌。個個提心愁滿腔。請看流民圖一幅。飢來驅我走羊腸。惟有那袞袞諸公樂未央。</p>

<p>這原因，是忠實劇運的人沒有堅决地走上話劇職業化這路上之故。職業化的劇團，誠然是有的，但那只以文明戲為限，這樣，無形中在人們心中造成了一個觀念，就是，麼術的戲劇，永遠與有少數的觀衆。所以它永遠不能職業化，但我們却要說，這是錯誤的，這只是因為戲劇藝術家不肯去引導觀衆，只一味故作高深，這才把他們推出門外了的。</p>
<p>我們因此相信，如果把高度的技巧運用到健康而易懂的劇作的演出上，一定能從那些不負責任的文明戲和各種地方戲那裏爭取若干甚至全部的觀衆，也就是說，話劇在這裏就要奠定職業化的基礎。</p>
<p>這是我們的意見，我們要實踐它，所以有揚子江劇社的組織，希望熱心話劇的同志批評，指敎，援助，謹此宣言。</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>藝壇情報載：二十八日，沈西苓表示要把「船家女」試演一下，公司中有人說：「這種片子，也要試演嗎？」意思之間，一船家女」是可以不必試演的，試演就無異是丟臉。</p>
<p>然而，「船家女」竟出於他們意料的第一日宣告客滿，不靠封面廣告，廣告中也沒有註明有結婚表演之短片而能賣座，沈西苓眞足以自豪了。</p>
<p>讓我再補充一句：「船家女」的試片券發後，有人預料「船家女」即使在試片的時候，也將會無人看。</p>
<p>然而結果怎樣妮？使得此輩人哭笑不得的，是最雄辯的事實。</p>
<p>傳：沈西苓己向明星請假返杭州。</p>
<p>「船家女」之後，還有「時勢英雄」和「天倫」，我們希望這些片子能賣錢，或者，中國電影還能有些希望，或者，電影觀衆對中國電影的觀感會得變好些。</p>

<h3>紐約汽車年展開幕</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>參加者三百餘新車</p>
<p>第二十六屆的美國汽車年展。已於上月二日開幕了。展覽的地點在紐約四十六和四十七條街間。勒克星登愛文義上的大中央宮。期限是一星期。每天從上午十時半到晚上十一時為參觀時間。在會塲中陳列的一九三六年各色新車。共計有三百多輛。美國製造的二十五種。英國製的四種。意大利一種。此外還有六種牌子的運貨汽車。汽車上的零件配件等。出品人前往陳列的約有六十家之多。</p>
<p>在已往的三十四年中。這一次的紐約汽車年展。不在新年的時候展覽。而改早在秋季舉行。這可算是破題第一遭哩。自從一千九百零一年以來。各屆車膿都是在正月裏舉行的。廠家所以將日子提早。他們是希冀在秋天製造新型車。而在冬季接收新車定單。開工續造。這樣子工人的工作可以格外的勻均了。這也是遵照了羅斯福總統的意旨而實行的。</p>
<p>紐約車展的性質的是全國性的。由汽車製造商會主開。在本年之內。除了這次的全國展覽之外。其他將不再舉行。在別城中的陳列將各當地經售商籌備。時間咸在這次車展之後。除了大中央官的展覽會外。通車出品在華爾道夫阿思都麗亞旅館陳列。福特也沒有參加紐約年展。所有福防和林肯另在阿思透飯店展覽。福特這次的新出品。要算福特才佛一種為前此所未有。這是中價車中V十二式車。除了在旅館中陳列之外。福特百老匯的銷售所也有樣車。阿思透飯店中所展覽的。為福特林肯的全部客車和貨車。還有才佛。新福特V八型車。大號定造式的V十二林肯。和各種商用運貨車等。各陳列室都由專家加以特殊的佈置。名車精室。眞是相得益彰。入塲參觀並不收費。每天參覜時間從十點到午夜始止。</p>
<p>通用的展覽會塲在華爾道夫阿思都麗亞旅館。所在全部的三層樓都被佔用。通用廠的各色車輛。各種另配件等。陳列靡遺。參觀時也從上午十時到午夜為止。入塲概不收資。通用的新車這次以安全為號召。在車輛交通中的三大要點——汽車。駕駛人。和公路。他們都把它們一一顧到。有一輛一九三六式的別克用來說明通用出品對於安全上各種計劃和處置。還有壁畫用來指示公路工程的進展。凡往參觀的又每人贈送一册「我們駕駛者」。塲中除陳列別克外。又有雪佛蘭。寳塔克。哇爾特司摩別爾。卡迪拉克。和拉薩爾。費休車身拿「沒有空隙的通風系」和其他特色。作為號召。前往參觀的人又可以自由試用車上機件。並由招待者開動機件。以供客觀。像「滕動作』等等。都在客人前面試騐說明着。</p>
<p>除了上述的通用和福特之外。別家車廠也很多借着各旅館的休憇室作為陳列之所。大中央宮的扶梯入口處。由陳飾專家。利用光學來佈置成一個「光綫」。燦爛悅目。不可方物。大陳列塲的中端綴着幾個—汽車展覽。塲子的四壁作淺綠色。間以朱紅色和克羅米。色澤非常調和悅目。塲中所用的地氈廣可六〇，〇〇〇方尺。足見會塲之不為小了。據開幕前有人說。塲子雖然這樣大。裏而却已完全被佔用着。以致後來的廠家要陳列也沒有地位了。第一層和第二層樓為客車陳列處。第三層樓為商用運貨車和另配件等陳列塲。</p>
<p>這次的展覽會不用說是一個很出色當行。除了一九三六式新車應有應用地在內展覧外。又有各樣的活動表演。所有車上某一部份如零配件等的動作和用途。都在參觀者前活動着。使人家一目了然。汽車界中人。和別業的領袖等。對於這個展覽會的結果如。都十分關心。他們預料這次年會的成績必定圓滿而可觀的。預料因秋季的購買活動。賣買兩方和工人等。均將蒙其利益。加以耶穌聖誕轉瞬卽屆。到時必能售出許多定單。又據說今年有人在冬季到南方去旅行的。都可以駕着最新式車出發了。還有因為新車的構造愈益精緻。雖在寒天。車內溫暖如春。從前一交冬令。差不多大家不願出外旅行。都將汽車束之高閣。現在呢。這個冬季的關頭。至少可以打破不少。汽車經售商現在已備作新貨。凡在展覽會選定新車後。短時期內卽可迅速交貨。</p>
<p>年會中陳列的各色汽車優點各有不同。不過在大體上說起來。式樣。舒適。行動。安全。和經濟。這幾點都有顯着的進步。外表上的更改。較明顯的為前車端。散熱器上的栅格式樣紙新穎。用克羅米鑲飾着。講到安全方面。那末一九三六式新車可謂當之無愧了。車架的製作格外的精密牢固。俾有極大的抗力。以免歪曲。還有風屏的尺寸地位。亦較前格外廣大和地位適當。這樣子可使駕車人對於前面視綫。格外淸晰了。車光燈也幾經改善。有許多牌子新車。裝有一種新色的燈光。可避對面的直射照眼。便利駕駛。及增進安全不少。駕駛者的舒適也已顧到。不但駕駛座的地位增大。俾便週轉。就是隔墊等用料。也較前為講究。使得駕駛者不感覺機力所傳達的熱度。其他如制動機。也多用自動的方法。以便運用。且其地位也有移置在駕駛者左邊的。總之各種改進。無非由經騐來證實的是了。</p>
<h3>汽車之冷熱汽設備</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>空氣調節器之新園地</p>
<p>人烟稠密之區。靡不塵埃飛揚。而此項物質。在顯微鏡檢查之下。固不僅污穢。惱人已也。且為疾病傳染之媒介。</p>
<p>茲屆發明空氣調節器之二十五週年。而汽車用之調節器文告成功。於是車室中。空氣新鮮。冬暖夏凉。要無遺憾矣。</p>
<p>第一輛裝置冷熟汽設備之汽車。為美國胡特機器公司及開利機器公司之聯合出品。前者製造汽車零件。後者則製造空氣調節器者也。</p>
<p>一年前。胡特公司卽以調節器裝於一輛五座汽車上。馳驅於芝加哥至大西洋岸之道上。作整夏之試騐。據謂所至之區。車內外氣侯得隨意調節至相差十度迄十五度。且車中潮氣亦為掃除一空云。</p>
<p>該項機件係利用汽車引擎之馬力以轉動其一氣壓機及一風扇。故電力費用。祇此而已。公共汽車所用者。需六匹馬力。客車所用者當無需如許馬力。惟是否尚有小型出品。迄今未聞該公司有所發表。</p>
<p>該器所用凍劑。為一加侖之無毒兼無爆性者。先由氣壓機冷之。使流經管子而冷化空氣。繼以受周圍之熱氣被蒸發為汽體。而鑽聚於車頂存器中。終復遇外界冷氣流變為流質而再落入氣壓機中。於是周而復始。克盡厥職也。</p>
<p>法國網球健將亨利高開氏素喜活潑敏捷。故其最近旅行安南香港斐律濱羣島時。亦必選購福特V八車以供乘坐之用。左圖乃氏與新車合影。</p>
<h3>汽車間隙之校凖</h3>
<p>— 陳星</p>
<p>—俗呼「校凡而脚」—</p>
<p>汽門。倘若間隙過小。就　得早。關得晚。間隙過大。就開得晚。關得早。進汽門與出汽門。開早關晚。或開晚關早。那麼進汽與出汽的時間。就會太長或過短。引擎的進汽與出汽。其時間均須照設計時的規定。如果稍有不當。卽足妨礙引擊工作的完美。所以遇引擊的動作過劣。發覺係汽門的間隙失常所致。卽須把汽門的間隙。加以嚴格的校準。</p>
<p>打磨汽門（俗呼磨凡而）。以免漏汽。是一伴最普通常的修理工作。但當打磨工作完畢。重新裝上的時候。汽門間隙。卽起變動。必須重新加以校準。否則。引擊卽難照工作。</p>
<p>汽門的間隙過大。引擎轉動的時候。就發生「的答的答」的雜聲。如遇此種情形。卽可斷定汽門間隙有重新校準的必要。</p>
<p>汽門間隙　汽門間隙。依製造時的設計。各車微有不同。如馬律師小牛牌。大多數的引擊。仍是需要校準的。</p>
<p>校準前的注意物體遇冷則縮。遇熱則脹。汽門與汽門桿。接受汽缸內爆炸後所生的高熱。卽起膨脹。因之此時汽門的間隙。必較汽門與汽門桿未受熱時為小。如果在引擎凉時。將汽門間隙校準。那麼。待引擎轉動後。各部暖熱。間隙必感太小。所以校準汽門間隙。須先將引擎發動片刻。然後行之。如此方可準確。</p>
<p>汽門間隙汽門間隙。依製造時的設計。各車微有不同。如馬律師小牛牌（一九三二）。進出汽門均為千分之六英寸。別克（一九三四）進出汽門均為千分之八英寸。司蒂倍克與韋　斯（一九三五）。進汽門為千分之四英寸。出汽門為千分之六英寸。格來台了（一九三五）進出汽門均為千分之十英寸。道奇。奧奔與地上飛（均一九三五）。進汽門均為千分之六英寸。出汽門均為千分之八英寸。最多約為千分之十英寸。最少約為千分之四英寸。惟出汽門間隙。常須較進汽門略大。因出汽門張開與關閉的時間較早。其散去的熱度。較淮汽門為少。有一些車子。進出汽門的間隙。可以相等。但出汽門間隙。切勿使小於進汽門</p>
<p>邊式汽門的校準此代汽門。裝於汽缸的一旁。順置。間隙卽在汽門挺（俗呼凡耳脚）與汽門桿的中間。汽門挺的上端。並備有調節螺絲與鎖螺絲。以供梭準之用。執行校準的時候。須將汽門蓋取去。另使一人將引擎搖轉。使汽缸內為壓縮行程。卽進出汽門都已緊閉。然後用大小適度的扳頭兩只。先將鎖螺絲鬆出。再把調節螺絲轉下或旋上。倘以適度的厚薄尺（俗呼斐南）或卡片試之。適足通過汽門間隙。不鬆不緊。卽可將鎖螺絲鎖回。惟轉緊鎖螺絲照。須將調節螺絲扳穩。勿使移動絲亳。以致間隙不準。一只汽缸的汽門間隙校準後。於是將引擎繼續搖轉。校準另外的一只。並依　將所有汽缸的汽門。都加以同樣的校準。</p>
<p>頂式汽門的校準此式汽門。裝置於汽缸蓋上。倒懸。間隙在汽門桿與搖桿（俗呼老鴉嘴）之間。搖桿的另一端上。設有調節螺絲與鎖螺絲。校準雖時。亦須先取去汽缸蓋上的汽門蓋。搖轉引擎。使二汽門緊閉。於是用一尺寸相符的扳頭。鬆出鎖螺絲。”把調節鎖螺絲胖旋鑿轉上或旋下。並照前法一樣。以厚薄尺或卡片測之。務使每一汽缸的汽門間隙適度為止。</p>
<p>校準以後校準後。可發動引擎以試之。引擎「的答的答的聲音。當可消滅。同時。其動作亦必可轉佳。如此時猶疑某一汽門間隙。是否滴當。常引擊發動時。亦可以厚薄尺揷入試之。若用卡片。那麼當然不能這樣辦。裝回汽門蓋。須注意襯墊（俗呼床）必須完好緊貼。</p>
<h3>福特汽車隊墨西哥城旅行記</h3>
<p>汽車旅行家之能由墨西哥政府所築新公路上直達墨西哥京城。今年尚屬破天荒第一次。此美麗之墨西哥京城。前此從無人能以汽車由美國直達其地者。因在孟特來及墨西哥城之間。計有四百英里之遙。無汽車可通之路。途中經過山脈之處甚多。是以此新路誠為極大之工程上創舉也。</p>
<p>此路雖尚未全部完成。但近月來已有極多之汽車通過該處矣。就中更有三輛福特V八汽車所組成之汽車隊一大隊。載有委員多人。由加拿大之孟特利爾起程。赴墨西哥城之國際里昂（或獅）會議。此次遄赴墨西哥城之旅行。來回計行二十天。大約經過六千五百英里之途程。途中雖時遇崎嶇不平險象環生之道路。尤其是經過山嶺之時。但從未遇到機械上之困難。惟於墨西哥境內覃麻由乞爾地方。其唯一之河中渡船因所載由紐吉賽開來之公共汽車一輛。車身過重。以致壓沉。一時因此而停頓者。連用此加拿大汽車隊在內。共有汽車六十輛之多。後幸遇工程師一人。負責建築墨京公路現代式鋼橋者。代為設法解决此問題。彼命令將工字鐵多根接連平放於未成橋樑之長橫木上。距離適合汽車輪距之用。於是各車循工字鐵之凹槽行駛而過安抵彼岸矣。</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Arrived in Beiping Yesterday to Handle All Emerging Issues, No Consideration Given to the Position of Director of the Administrative Office, Chen Yi and Others Are in Beiping Liaising with Various Parties, He Convenes a Meeting in Baoding</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin arrived in Beiping at 6:15 PM tonight. Inside and outside the station, security was tight. Over a hundred people including Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Zhang Zizhong, Bao Wenxue, and Feng Zhi'an came to the station to welcome him. After He got out of the car, he went to Jurentang to rest. He said that he was ordered by the Central Government to go north to inspect and to consult with Commander Song and local responsible authorities to handle all emerging issues. In addition, he was not charged with any other tasks. Whether he will take the position of Director of the Administrative Office of the Executive Yuan in Beiping is not yet under consideration. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baoding telephone: He Yingqin, Men Zhizhong, Lei Shourong, and others took a special train from Baoding at 2:00 PM today to Beiping. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, along with his entourage, guards, Men Zhizhong, Lei Shourong, and others, departed from Baoding by special train at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd to go to Beiping. Prior to this, representatives from various military and political organizations and groups in Beiping went to the station to welcome him. Military police and constabulary forces were stationed at the station and along the route to maintain strict security. Around 5:00 PM, Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Bao Wenxue, and other officers of the former Military Branch, as well as officers and soldiers of the 29th Army band, also arrived at the station one after another. Representatives from all walks of life stood in order, totaling about 500 people. At 5:50 PM in the afternoon, the "Zhongshan" armored train led the way into the station. At 6:20 PM, He's special train arrived at the West Railway Station of Qianmen. Military police and constabulary presented arms in salute, and the Weishubu Public Security Bureau band played music to welcome him. After the train stopped, Song Zheyuan and others boarded the train to pay their respects. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they got off the train together. He was wearing a military uniform, draped in a camel hair overcoat, and looked energetic. He took off his hat and smiled, nodding to the welcoming personnel. It took ten minutes before he left the station and took a car to Jurentang as his official residence to rest. Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others accompanied him to pay their respects. After talking for a few minutes, they took their leave. Reporters also went to pay their respects. He replied that he was ordered by the Central Government to go north to inspect and to consult with Commander Song, Chairman, and local responsible authorities to handle all emerging issues. In addition, he was not charged with any other tasks. Whether he will take the position of Director of the Administrative Office of the Executive Yuan in Beiping is not yet under consideration. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Baoding) At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, He Yingqin, accompanied by Lei Shourong, Men Zhizhong, and others, left Baoding by special train for Beiping, arriving at 6:00 PM. Wan Fulin and the heads of various departments went to the station to see him off. Shang Zhen was not fully recovered from his illness, and he went to the station to welcome He with great effort last night, slightly catching a cold, so he did not go to see him off. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Hearing that He has arrived in Beiping, the people here are greatly relieved. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 6:35 PM this afternoon, He Yingqin arrived at the West Railway Station by special train, protected by troops, and the police were also on special alert. Many important officials such as Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, etc. were at the station to welcome him. After He got out of the car and met with everyone, he was escorted by the guard to take a car to his residence in Nanhai. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong took Xiong Shihui's special car to Baoding at 9:30 AM to visit He Yingqin. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Song Zheyuan sent Lei Shourong by special train to Baoding at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd to welcome He Yingqin. After getting off the train, he went to Shang Zhen's residence to visit He. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Baoding) He Yingqin rested at Shang Zhen's private residence on the night of the 2nd. It is said that he felt slightly tired due to the long journey and fell asleep after a brief conversation. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Baoding, He Yingqin and Xiong Shihui arrived in Baoding at 8:30 PM last night. Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Bao Wenxue, and Men Zhizhong, Song Zheyuan's representative, went to the station to welcome them. He and others held an important meeting at Shang Zhen's residence, which lasted until 1:00 AM. Xiong Shihui went to Beiping before dawn this morning. He's departure date to Beiping is yet to be determined. (3rd Japanese Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang are currently in Taiyuan. After He Yingqin arrives in Beiping, they will go to Beiping at the same time to meet with He. (3rd Japanese Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Yi arrived in Beiping from Tianjin at 10:40 PM last night and stayed at Jurentang. According to him, the central government has a solution, and it is hoped that it can be resolved after He Yingqin comes to Beiping. (2nd Japanese Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin exchanged three phone calls with Doihara Kenji last night in Baoding. The first was at 11:00 PM, initiated by He to Doihara. Doihara then returned the call from Beiping to He. At 3:00 AM this morning, He talked with Doihara again. Well-informed Chinese sources said that the conversation between the two sides was still satisfactory. However, the results have not been leaked. Qin Dechun denied Song Zheyuan's visit to Baoding yesterday. Song only sent Men Zhizhong and Lei Shourong as his representatives. Several Japanese personnel, including an advisor to Yin Rugeng, also arrived in Baoding this morning, but they had not met with He by the evening. Several Japanese planes circled over Baoding for several hours this morning, causing great panic among the people. Xiong Shihui arrived in Beiping this morning. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military authorities seem to show hostility to He Yingqin's trip to the north, but Chinese dignitaries here have a similarly optimistic air, believing that He has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese in the past and has diplomatic talent, so that this difficult situation can achieve a reasonably satisfactory result. Well-informed sources all believe that Song Zheyuan resisted Japanese pressure and showed calmness and diplomatic demeanor, so the situation that everyone thought Song must declare autonomy a few days ago was never realized. At the moment, people generally have a kind of hope that a solution can be obtained that is not completely unsatisfactory in China, and Japan can also slightly fulfill its wishes. According to reliable foreign sources, Doihara has clearly stated the importance of the results of his mission this time. What is his mission? It is to seize a large piece of land for Japan in fact or in practice without spending a single arrow. Doihara's past achievements have always been successful. Now he is making his most difficult diplomatic struggle. Song Zheyuan quietly arrived in Baoding yesterday afternoon and did not go to the station to welcome He, but waited for He in Shang Zhen's official residence to meet. Chairman Chen Yi of Fujian came from Nanjing, met with Japanese Commander Tada in Tianjin, and has now arrived in Beiping. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Baoding) At 11:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, He Yingqin met with Japanese reporters at Shang Zhen's residence and issued the following statement: My trip to the north is to inspect various political affairs and to discuss with Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen and other authorities the temporary problems that have arisen. In addition, there is no other mission. As for taking office as the director of the Executive Yuan's office in Beiping, it has not been considered at all. China and Japan, which are geographically and historically close, should be friendly and harmonious in the spirit of co-existence and co-prosperity, and maintain peace in East Asia and the world. This is what I have always hoped for. (3rd Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Beiping, Chen Yi, chairman of Fujian Province, who is assisting He Yingqin with the important mission of resolving the North China situation, met with Song Zheyuan last night and is also negotiating with various parties today. His conversation with reporters is as follows: The central government is very worried about the current situation in the north and intends to resolve it peacefully, so it sent He Yingqin and I to the north. The central government and Japan have completely the same intention on economic cooperation between China and Japan in the north and joint prevention of Redization, but the views on the method are slightly different. However, it is still unclear what the people in the north hope for the central government's sovereignty in the so-called autonomy issue, so it is still necessary to investigate. Although there are plans to set up a Northern Administrative Committee, etc., it has not yet been decided. It has also not been decided to convene a meeting of the chairmen of the five provinces. He will come to Beiping within today, so I am sure that we can decide on a peaceful solution during our stay in Beiping. (3rd Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui and He Jingwu Arrive in Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Shihui and He Jingwu took a special train to Beiping with Lu Xian at 1:00 AM this morning to discuss important official matters. Song sent Lei Shourong as a representative, who arrived in Baoding from Beiping by special train at 10:00 AM this morning to report everything. After He arrived in Baoding last night, he immediately summoned various dignitaries in Baoding that night to discuss matters and listen to various reports. At about 1:00 AM this morning, He sent He Jingwu to accompany Xiong Shihui by special train to Beiping. Shang Zhen also sent Lu Xian to take care of them. They arrived in Beiping at 5:10 AM this morning. Song sent Qin Dechun to the station to welcome them. After Xiong got off the train, he rested at Jurentang. Chen Yi arrived in Beiping last night and also stayed at Jurentang.

<h3>What Is Hoped for from the First Plenary Session of the Fifth National Congress</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The members of the Fifth Central Supervisory Committee have been sworn into office the day before yesterday, and the First Plenary Session is being held immediately, gathering talented individuals in one hall to express their great strategies for saving the world. Its grand occasion is unprecedented. The special spirit manifested by the Fifth National Congress lies in the word "unity." In the past, there may have been places where the intentions of various parties were not fully reconciled, but before this congress, they were able to abandon their private views and jointly plan for national affairs in order to complete the mission of the congress and strengthen the power of the central government. The road is difficult, and the national crisis is deep, but now, facing it with all our strength, swearing to the sincerity of the union, and planning a unified pace, there should be enough to save the decline and achieve recovery. The First Plenary Session, following the Fifth National Congress, will sort out the resolved proposals and create the future political situation. For the phenomena of the past that cannot be satisfied, under the review of many talented individuals, it will be able to actively renew it and comfort the people's eager hopes. I, with the rest of my exhausted life, look forward to the development of great plans, and I cannot help but speak out. I dare to take advantage of the opportunity to make a humble contribution.</p>
<p>Today, the only serious problem facing us, who does not know that it is the diplomatic situation that needs to be opened up. This matter is of great importance. The central government has already decided on a policy and announced it at home and abroad. I also do not want to rashly participate in the final discussion. I only hope that the authorities will gather a spirit of firm determination and move forward, and quickly seek a response that is in line with reality. Do not hesitate any longer, and sit back and allow it to grow and become difficult to deal with. Regarding dealing with diplomacy, this is one.</p>
<p>Our country has suffered from famines for years and has repeatedly experienced major disturbances. The people's livelihood has reached the extreme. There is not a day that they do not hope for someone to care for them. The gentlemen in power also know that this is an important plan. Thinking of revitalizing ourselves, we have often heard generous suggestions and tactful proposals on the seats of previous congresses. However, after the congress closed, either things were hindered and delayed and not implemented, or they were not handled effectively, and the decrees were equal to empty words. Although excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies are said to be cut, local areas still collect them under various names. Although there are special articles in the law for punishing corruption, many officials still manipulate them from top to bottom. In addition, local bullies are rampant, and petty officials collude with each other. There are many instances of political corruption in various places. In this First Plenary Session, how should we make a painful determination and determine a method to exert the effectiveness of administration and sweep away the pervasive atmosphere of turbidity? Knowing that empty words are not enough to quench hunger and thirst, implementation can only be said to live up to the people's expectations. Regarding renewing internal affairs, this is two.</p>
<p>In recent times, people have become accustomed to superficiality, and most of them take flattery to please others. Sages treat themselves with wisdom, and only follow the example of the golden man's silence. The spirit of righteous remonstrance is almost extinct in the world. The central officials have high positions and high salaries. They are usually comfortable with their own opinions, and no one dares to disagree. But people are not sages, and how can they be free from mistakes? There is no way to seek lessons, so they make mistakes and do not change them. The ancients said that the promise of thousands of men is not as good as the frankness of one scholar, which should be valued by the righteous and not to be taken lightly. Even if all the officials can restrain themselves, the official affairs are complicated and the officials are filled with positions. How can they guarantee that everyone is flawless? If the people's opinions are not free, all mistakes will be blocked from reaching the top, and local political corruption will be difficult to eradicate. Instead, the officials in power will suffer the consequences. The ancients were afraid of preventing people from speaking. How much more so under the current circumstances? The gentlemen of this congress should share their hearts with each other and do their best to be humble and sincere. They should definitely achieve the effect of listening carefully, reward those who make suggestions, and widely solicit public opinion. On the one hand, it will help the officials in power, and on the other hand, it will eliminate the confusion of the lower officials. It is enough to promote governance and also to correct people's hearts. Regarding opening up avenues of speech, this is three.</p>
<p>The above three points, although they are old-fashioned and superficial commonplaces, are our sincere wishes. We will not hesitate to reiterate them at the First Plenary Session, and deeply hope that the congress will be able to comfort our expectations.</p>

First, Secretary-General Kawasaki stated that the issue of China's monetary system reform has a direct and significant impact on the Japanese economic community. Therefore, a special committee should be established to address this issue. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to establish a committee and the following members were elected:</p>
<p>Toizumi Matajiro, Nakajima Yataru, Nomura Kakuroku, Ichimatsu Sadakichi, Yamamichi Joichi, Nagata Zensaburo, Toyota Toyokichi, Tada Mitsunaga, Tanaka Ko, Koyamatani Zo, Tanaka Takeo, Kanda Masao, Matsuda Takechiyo, Hisa Shohei, and Suematsu Keiichiro. (Nikkei Union dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japan's New Party Movement: The Uchida Faction is Gradually Becoming Active</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The movement to establish a new party, after the passing of Tokonami, is now centered on Uchida Kosai, Mochizuki Keisuke, Yamazaki Tatsunosuke, and others, conducting various plans. However, the three ministers have different intentions regarding this case, and later due to budget formulation and large-scale exercises, it was temporarily suspended. Now that the budget formulation has been successfully completed, the faction centered on Uchida Kosai is gradually becoming active. When Uchida visited Takahashi Korekiyo, the Minister of Finance, on the afternoon of the 2nd, he also discussed the issue of establishing a new party in detail. After Uchida inquired about the Minister of Finance's opinion, he also had earnest discussions with Mochizuki, in order to take preparatory work. It is intended that its scale must be formed before the next Diet convenes, and it is believed that a favorable situation for the new party camp is indicated. Therefore, it is necessary to exert efforts to promote its establishment before the Diet convenes, or at least organize a club as a basis for the new party's formation. It is said that the club will soon be materialized. (Nikkei Union dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaches Stationed in Europe End Meeting in Germany</h3>

<h3>Outgoing Governor of Hong Kong Delivers Farewell Address</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) At the banquet held by the China Association last night to entertain the outgoing Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Peel, the Governor delivered a speech, saying that some people are now advocating that the protection of territories and colonies should be placed under a trusteeship system. Based on his 36 years of experience in Malaysia and Hong Kong, he believes that this proposal is very harmful and will be opposed by residents everywhere, whether they are Eastern or Western. The Governor went on to mention the relationship between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, saying that currently they both have a sense of friendship, but have not achieved better results. This is something that he finds regrettable. Although friends in Guangzhou have expressed their friendly relations by telegram, they have not shown much willingness to assist Hong Kong in a genuine manner. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>The British Monarch Addresses Parliament, Declaring Support for the League of Nations, Using All Efforts to Maintain Peace, and Actively Enriching National Defense</h3>
<p>(London) Viscount Hailsham today read the British monarch's opening address to Parliament in the House of Lords, explaining Britain's attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian War, previewing the main plans in the government's future political program, and declaring that British foreign policy will be based on support for the League of Nations. Because the monarch was in mourning for his sister, he was unable to personally attend the opening ceremony of the new Parliament. Therefore, his address first expressed his regret for not being able to attend in person today. He went on to say that the government's foreign policy will continue to be based on strong support for the League of Nations. He later said that the government remains prepared to fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant with other member states. The government is determined to use all its efforts to maintain peace. In order to carry out this righteous cause, the government has to adopt any economic and financial plans regarding Italy with the other fifty member states. At the same time, the government will continue to use its influence to promote a peace agreement acceptable to Italy, Ethiopia, and the League of Nations in this dispute. The address briefly mentioned the naval conference to be held in London and stated the necessity of not allowing any defects in national defense forces. The address mentioned the coal mining industry's turmoil, saying that the Parliament will introduce legislation to stipulate the unification of coal taxes under national control, and the safety issues in coal mines will be studied with the latest scientific knowledge. In addition, the government will submit necessary orders to Parliament in order to adjust the sales methods of the coal mining industry. The government will continue to promote the revival of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and pay special attention to the areas with the most unemployment. The government will introduce legislation on unemployment insurance for agricultural workers, the development of railways, and the revitalization of British and Imperial civil aviation. At the same time, the government is currently considering the following difficult problems: 1. The overproduction of the cotton spinning industry; 2. The increase in school age; 3. The improvement of medical and educational services; 4. The elimination of slums and the reconstruction of housing; 5. Maternity issues and the service of paid midwives.

<p>(London) According to official claims, the existing air defense system in the London area will be reorganized to allow closer cooperation between the army and the Royal Air Force. Currently, air defense matters are handled on a district basis, but in the future, they will be unified under the command of the First Air Defense Division of the Army. The division includes four air defense teams, each with a strength of more than a brigade of infantry, which also includes artillery regiments and engineer regiments. The funds required for this new air defense organization are allocated from the recent government issuance of national defense loans. (Havas dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The government today announced its financial plan, which includes the issuance of a new public debt of £35,000,000, a portion of which will be used to strengthen national defense. (Kuomintang dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Italian Monarch Uses Gold and Silver from the Palace to Resist Sanctions, and Parliamentarians Also Donate Medals</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian monarch today allocated a large batch of gold and silver bars from the palace museum to the Bank of Italy to resist sanctions. Also, when the Parliament of Vocational Groups, i.e., the House of Representatives, met on December 7, all parliamentarians donated the medals they received to the government. The Italian colony of Tunisia in Africa has already donated 14 kilograms of cash, and the city of Genoa presented 200 kilograms of cash to the government yesterday. (Havas dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy's largest industrialist, Feltinelli, with assets of 800 million lire, suddenly felt unwell while answering questions before the Italian Loan Committee today, accused of colluding with a certain foreign country to harm Italy. He died before he could be treated by a doctor, shocking the entire city of Milan. It is said that during the trial, photographs of Feltinelli's letters to foreign banks were presented, in which Feltinelli had deposited US$5,000 and £6 million in Swiss banks in his wife's name. The Italian government has confiscated all of Feltinelli's industries in Italy and seized his funds abroad. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) A foreign ministry spokesperson stated today that since Canada has withdrawn its oil embargo proposal, Italy believes that if no other country is willing to propose it again, there is no reason to discuss this anti-Italian plan in Geneva. Italy believes that the meeting of the Sanctions Committee on December 12 should be cancelled, and that after the withdrawal of this proposal, a better atmosphere can be created to resolve the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia through diplomatic means.

<h3>The Ethiopian Government Sends a Note to the League of Nations, Saying that Harar will Not Station Troops to Avoid Civilians Being Bombed by Aircraft, and Italian Troops will Launch an Attack Again Within Days</h3>
<p>(London) The Ethiopian government today sent a note to the League of Nations, saying that in order to avoid civilians being bombed from the sky, it has decided to withdraw the troops stationed in Harar and dedicate the city solely as a place for the wounded from the Ogaden Province and the Southern Front to recuperate, and will not use it for any military purposes. Recently, outside officials have been spreading rumors that the Ethiopian army has won victories on the Southern Front. It is now learned that this is actually because the native soldiers in the Italian army heard animal sounds in the forest at night and mistakenly thought that tribal people were advancing to attack. They abandoned their weapons and baggage in a panic and retreated several miles, hence the rumors of an Italian defeat.</p>
<p>It is said that the forward attackers on the left and central wings of the Italian army are not being hindered by Ethiopian resistance, but are increasingly unwilling to fight because they are weary of the bitter fighting with the Somali soldiers and people of the same ethnicity. At the same time, officials in Asmara claim that Colonel Kilmedin Haicos, the representative of the Tigray in the Ethiopian Parliament, has surrendered to the Italian political commissioner in Adwa. Tigray has now completely surrendered to Italy, which proves that Italy's political aggression in Ethiopia has been effective. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Qiqiqa: It is expected that Italian troops will attack Daga Bour, which is 130 miles east of Harar, again within days. It is said that after the Italian army suffered a setback in Anar recently and lost many tanks, it reorganized its army. The Ethiopian army's front line seems to be about 40 miles away from Gola Hai in the north, with many outposts set up on the south side of the city. However, because the Ethiopian military command does not want to concentrate too many troops in one place to avoid being heavily bombed by Italian aircraft, the garrison in the area seems very thin. It is estimated that 60 aircraft belong to Italian Somalia, deserting Somali soldiers joined the Ethiopian army. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: Officials here announced today that the Italian army has retreated from Gola Hai, the center of Ogaden Province, and Jilokubi, an important city in the province. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Decides to Ban Oil and Prepare to Consider Peace Talks; Italian Cabinet Also Decides to Increase Mining Production; Canada Still Follows League of Nations Methods</h3>
<p>(London) Last night, the British Cabinet held a meeting lasting three hours, fully agreeing that Britain should participate in the collective oil embargo against Italy. It was reported that the meeting also discussed French Premier Laval's peace efforts. Although no announcement was made after the meeting, it is understood that the government is now fully prepared to consider any proposal Mussolini might put forward that offers even a slight hope of resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute through the League of Nations. The news of the British Cabinet's action did not surprise informed circles in Paris. Laval had anticipated that the British Cabinet might reach this decision, and had therefore asked the Italian Ambassador to Paris, Cerruti, a few days ago to find out Mussolini's intentions, so that possible actions could be explored quickly. Opinion in France is that the British Cabinet's decision has increased the momentum for positive action on the Ethiopian issue, and it is hoped that a way to negotiate can be found before the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on December 12 to consider implementing the oil embargo against Italy. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) During today's Cabinet meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden and Minister Without Portfolio Eden strongly advocated that Britain implement a full oil embargo against Italy, believing that this plan could force Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to comply with acceptable peace terms. As for Italy's recent peace terms, it is rumored that they include demanding that Ethiopia cede a large area of land in Ogaden, Harar, and even Wogga Den to connect Italian Eritrea and Somaliland. Also, a district in northwestern Ethiopia must be taken over by Italy. The British Cabinet is also willing to allow Ethiopia to cede land adjacent to British Kenya, but expresses opposition to the cession of land adjacent to Sudan in the northwest. It is understood that Britain and France have already agreed that if Mussolini does not comply, then oil embargoes and similar plans must be implemented gradually within the shortest possible time. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini convened another Cabinet meeting today to discuss the progress of dealing with League of Nations sanctions and the issue of war and peace. This was the second meeting in seventy-two hours, reportedly dedicated to reviewing the international situation. The blatant anti-League of Nations sentiment that was previously seen in Rome is no longer apparent today. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The State Council has recently decided on important measures to resist sanctions, stipulating the establishment of a state-run metal and mineral administration to be responsible for exploring domestic mineral resources. At the same time, gas plants and coal mines have received orders to produce a certain amount of mineral oil and extract a certain amount of coal within a specified period. In addition, anyone who privately transports or hoards currency will be severely punished as a warning to others. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Hoare is scheduled to go to Switzerland for recuperation at the end of this week. French Premier Laval will take the opportunity of Hoare's passage through Paris on Saturday and Sunday to invite him to lunch to discuss various diplomatic issues. It is expected that Hoare will depart from here for Switzerland on Sunday evening. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the "Min Sheng Bao" telegraphed that the recent statement by the Canadian government that it does not want to automatically expand the scope of sanctions to include an oil embargo against Italy does not fundamentally change Canada's attitude. Canada will still support new sanctions against Italy. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Sets December 18 as Wedding Ring Memorial Day; Women Across the Country Donate Wedding Rings to the Authorities</h3>
<p>(Rome) December 18th will be designated as Wedding Ring Memorial Day throughout Italy, according to a government order issued today. On that day, solemn ceremonies will be held in front of war memorials and the graves of fallen soldiers, and women across the country will donate their wedding rings to the authorities to resist sanctions against Italy by member states of the League of Nations. At the same time, the Italian King has donated a large number of gold and silver utensils to the Bank of Italy to help resist the sanctions movement. The Bank of Italy today donated one million lire to Mussolini. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Activities of Fascist Groups; Another Difficult Hurdle for Laval</h3>
<p>(Paris) During today's heated debate in the Chamber of Deputies on the Communist Party's demand for the complete dissolution of the Fascist Leagues, Mr. Kerillis, a prominent leader of the Radical Socialist Party, declared that if the leagues were not dissolved, the left-wing parties were prepared to overthrow the government. Now everything depends on whether Premier Laval can obtain the support of a powerful group within the Radical Socialist Party led by Minister Without Portfolio Herriot. Herriot will announce his political views to his comrades this afternoon. Today's debate was started by Communist Party member Laemmet, who vehemently criticized the actions of members of the Fascist Leagues. Kerillis followed, reading excerpts from letters received from members of the "Popular Front," the main left-wing groups, and said that if the demands were not met, the left-wing parties intended to overthrow the government. Premier Laval entered the Chamber at 11:30 a.m. Just as he arrived at the floor, left-wing deputies were beginning to shout "Resign!" repeatedly at Finance Minister Caillaux. The debate was adjourned at 12:10 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. It is expected that it will not end until Thursday. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies convened at 9:40 this morning to discuss the activities of Fascist groups. Premier and Foreign Minister Laval and Interior Minister Paganon were present. Today's meeting is another difficult hurdle for the government after the recent discussion of financial issues in the Chamber of Deputies. The fate of the government is closely tied to this. The so-called Fascist groups were formed after the Paris riots of February 6 last year. They have always attacked the parliamentary system and opposed extreme left-wing parties. There are many factions of this type, and their views are not very consistent. Among them are (1) veterans' groups, such as the Croix de Feu (Cross of Fire), whose actions are the most intense; (2) the Jeunesses Patriotes (Patriotic Youth), which is a purely patriotic group; (3) the Action Française (French Action), which advocates the restoration of the monarchy; and (4) the "Fascist Party," which advocates the implementation of Fascism. These groups have repeatedly held meetings and demonstrations in various parts of France. The left-wing parties, namely the Radical Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, have organized the Popular Front to resist them and firmly demand the dissolution of the right-wing groups, saying that they "threaten democracy and freedom." Regarding this, former Premiers Doumergue, Flandin, and current Premier Laval have tried to delay the discussion at the meetings of previous parliaments in order to avoid direct conflict. The report on the right-wing demonstration movement presented to the Chamber of Deputies by Radical Party member Chauvenet, and the questions raised by deputies regarding the past disturbances by the right-wing, are now being discussed by Premier Laval because the Radical Party advocated discussing the activities of Fascist groups in the Chamber of Deputies at its recent party congress. The Radical Party holds a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and is critical to the government's position. Laval cannot ignore the party's views. In addition, the recent violent clashes between members of the Croix de Feu in Limoges and the Popular Front have aroused public anger, making it imperative to address the issue. Therefore, this time the Chamber of Deputies is meeting to discuss this thorny issue. It is expected that Premier Laval will explain the government's attitude towards Fascist groups and the constitutional limitations on the right of people to assemble at today's meeting. The debate, which began this morning, will continue this afternoon. The Chamber will be adjourned all day tomorrow, so it will not end until Thursday. The fate of the Laval cabinet will depend on the attitude taken by the right-wing deputies affiliated with various Fascist groups and the majority of deputies from the Radical Party. When the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government's financial policy, only 63 of the 156 Radical Party deputies voted in favor. It is expected that 20 to 30 of them will join the opposition in the discussion of the Fascist group issue. If too many Radical Party deputies vote against the government, the Laval cabinet may lose its prestige due to its important party's defection. It is now known that Radical Party leader Herriot will continue to appeal to his party members to ensure the government's final victory, but even if the government wins, the majority it obtains is likely to be 20 to 30 votes less than the one it obtained when passing the financial policy. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government submitted the 1936 budget to the Chamber of Deputies yesterday. The total estimated revenue is 40,303,000,000 francs, and the total estimated expenditure is 40,260,000,000 francs. The bill was originally scheduled to be discussed this afternoon, but because the Chamber of Deputies has decided to begin discussing the activities of Fascist groups this morning, and the government intends to continue this discussion this afternoon, the discussion of the budget bill will inevitably be postponed. According to observers of the political situation, the government will still win the debate on the Fascist group issue, and the majority it obtains will be roughly the same as in the previous two votes. However, it can be asserted that the left-wing Socialist Party and Communist Party will still try to get the majority party to join the opposition. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>More Riots in Cairo</h3>
<p>Cairo - A thousand students rioted again today to protest British influence in Egypt. Police fired twice to disperse the crowd. Demonstrators marched through the streets, demolishing the iron railings protecting trees along the roadside, using them as weapons to attack the police, and shouting slogans such as "Long live the revolution! Long live revolution leader Nahas! Down with Hoare!" The police had previously fired warning shots around the residence of former Premier Mahmoud to disperse the demonstrators there. Mahmoud is an advocate of moderation in the current anti-British movement. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Cairo - Today, several university students went to the residence of former Egyptian Premier Mahmoud, broke down the door, and destroyed the furniture inside. Police arrested four students. Mahmoud is the leader of the Liberal Party and is known for being pro-British, which is why he is dissatisfied with the Nationalist Party. The destruction of Mahmoud's residence shows that the Egyptian Nationalist Party has split into two factions: one still advocating a moderate attitude and the other advocating a new strategy of taking direct action.

<h3>American Historian Professor Breasted Passes Away</h3>
<p>(New York) The famous American historian Professor Breasted, known for discovering ancient cultures by excavating ancient tombs in Egypt and elsewhere, has passed away at the age of seventy. His illness was initially suspected to be a fever, but later it was known to be a plague of an unknown nature. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) Dr. James Henry Breasted, Director of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and an authority on Oriental studies, passed away here today at the age of seventy. Doctors announced after examining his remains that the cause of death was quite ordinary, which clearly refutes the untrustworthy rumors. Superstitious people always say that those who excavate ancient Egyptian royal tombs are haunted by ghosts, and Professor Breasted studied in the tombs for ten days in 1923. Breasted was born in Rockford and studied at North Central College, the Chicago Theological Seminary, Yale University, and the University of Berlin. He was appointed as an assistant in Egyptology at the University of Chicago in 1894 and repeatedly presided over the school's field expeditions to Egypt and Western Asia. In 1925, he devoted himself to running the Oriental Institute, later serving as its director. Breasted was a member of many academic organizations around the world, received many honorary degrees, and was awarded a doctorate in law from Oxford University. His multi-volume "Ancient History" is an immortal work. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Brazil Trade Agreements Announced</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today formally announced the trade agreements between Canada and the United States, and between Brazil and the United States. Both agreements will take effect on January 1 of next year. The U.S.-Brazil trade agreement was recently passed by the Brazilian Senate. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull signed trade agreements between the United States and Brazil with Brazilian Ambassador to the United States Aranha in February of this year, stipulating that import quotas should not be implemented between the two countries. In addition to reducing tariffs on U.S. goods exported to Brazil, Brazilian coffee is allowed to be imported into the United States duty-free. More than half a year later, President Roosevelt issued an order this afternoon announcing that the trade agreement will take effect on January 1 of next year. At the same time, he sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, based on the method of reducing tax rates stipulated in the trade agreements already signed between the U.S. government and various countries, all countries should enjoy the same benefits, with the exception of Germany. The letter also explained the reasons for this differential treatment, saying that "Germany's methods of trade with the United States are clearly discriminatory, so I ask you not to grant German goods the above-mentioned tax reduction benefits."

<h3>U.S. Restricts Cotton Production, New Four-Year Plan Announced</h3>
<p>(Washington) Agriculture Secretary Wallace announced today a newly established four-year cotton production adjustment plan to replace the contract that expires at the end of this year. The new plan stipulates that the national basic cotton planting area is 44,500,000 acres. The effective period of the contract includes the four years from 1936 to 1939. Cotton farmers must plant at least 30% less than the basic acreage. This percentage will gradually increase to a maximum reduction of 45%. In 1936, the government will pay 5 cents per pound in compensation for reduced cotton planting, based on the average yield. According to this year's plan, at least 25% and up to 35% must be planted less. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) today proposed a four-year arrangement contract to cotton farmers, the purpose of which is to reduce cotton production and increase the benefits for tenants. The main points of the contract are as follows: (1) The term is four years, not one year; (2) The national basic cotton acreage is reduced from 45,500,000 acres to 44,500,000 acres; (3) Although cotton production in 1936 will be reduced by 25% to 35% compared to 1935, it is still necessary to reduce it by 30% to 45% according to a certain basic figure. It is estimated that the output in 1936 will be approximately 11,000,000 to 12,000,000 bales; (4) A subsidy of 5 cents per pound, or a subsidy of $8.10 per acre, will be given in one lump sum, instead of the previous subsidy of 4.75 cents per pound, which was issued in three installments; (5) Tenants who share profits according to output will receive 25% of this subsidy, instead of 15%. The AAA stated that the agency considered the special position of cotton in American national life, and therefore first paid attention to the well-being of cotton farmers. This procedure will not only benefit cotton farmers, but also benefit the South and the entire country. As for how much cotton land will be abandoned in 1936, or how much this procedure will cost, agricultural regulatory personnel do not make predictions. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Naval Conference "Prelude": British Advocate Big Ships and Big Guns, Japanese Delegation of Twenty-Nine Arrives in London, Possibly Proposing a New Agreement between Britain, America, France, and Japan</h3>
<p>(London) After the arrival of the Japanese delegation in London, the disarmament conference has entered its preliminary stage. It is rumored that the British government has changed its stance on the tonnage of battleships, shifting to advocate for large ships with big guns. Therefore, the situation of the conference is different from that of the preparatory meeting. Previously, Britain had advocated for a maximum battleship tonnage of 26,000 tons with 12-inch guns. However, as a result of confronting the Italian air force in the Mediterranean, it has decided to increase the battleship tonnage to over 30,000 tons. (2nd, Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation to the London Naval Conference, a total of twenty-nine people, arrived in London today via Siberia. Although the number of people is large this time, it did not create as deep an impression on the general public as the trilateral discussions last winter. According to Chief Delegate Admiral Nagano, Japan "claims" that it will not deviate from its official policy of establishing a common high limit based on major naval powers. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Admiral Nagano and Admiral Nagai of the Japanese Disarmament Conference delegation arrived at London Station at about 3 PM on the 2nd. Members of the Japanese Embassy in Britain and representatives of the British Naval and Foreign Ministries welcomed them at the station. The group stayed at the Crowan House dormitory. That evening, they attended an informal welcome party held by Acting Ambassador Fujii. (2nd, Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation arrived here this morning. Admiral Nagano, the chief delegate to the Naval Conference, told the Associated Press that Japan is eager to avoid international naval competition. However, if the conference results do not lead to a new agreement, Japan must also safeguard its own position. Japan is determined to maintain its position among the naval powers. However, this determination does not immediately mean increasing its naval tonnage. Naval equality is indispensable to Japan's security and reputation. Japan also agrees to retain the Washington Treaty's ban on any country building fortifications in the Pacific. (2nd, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Minsheng Daily reported from Tokyo that the Japanese delegation attending the Naval Conference brought a plan to seek a new agreement between the United States, Britain, France, and Japan to maintain peace in the Pacific. Foreign Minister Hirota predicted that even if the Naval Conference fails, this agreement could still be established. Hirota hopes that the new Pacific Pact will include the following points: (1) The permanent neutrality of the Philippines, and the permanent withdrawal of US naval and land forces stationed in the Philippines. (2) Renewal and amendment of the 1921 Four-Power Treaty to make it a non-aggression pact. (3) The four countries each guarantee not to attack or infringe upon any territory in the Pacific region. (4) Renewal of Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, stipulating that no fortifications may be built on designated islands in the Pacific in the future. The reporter stated that this agreement has no hope of success, as accepting Hirota's plan would be tantamount to tacitly acknowledging Japan's exclusive dominance in the Western Pacific and the freedom of action of Japanese troops in China. (2nd, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) Reports of Japan seeking a new Pacific peace agreement have been met with considerable indifference in official circles here. The State Department stated that the US delegation attending the London Naval Conference has instructions to reduce armaments and no other mission. Others believe that the news is intended to test American opinion on a non-aggression pact. However, Soviet Russia has been requesting to conclude such a treaty with Japan for several years. Therefore, it is surprising to hear that Japan wants to conclude this treaty with the United States, Britain, and France while ignoring Soviet Russia. (2nd, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to dispatches from London, it is rumored that due to the Italo-Ethiopian War, Britain is considering a potential Anglo-Italian naval war, and due to strategic considerations, has suddenly turned to big ships and big guns. The Japanese Navy's view on this is as follows: The truth of the news of a shift from a majority of small ships to a big ship policy is currently unclear. However, judging from past claims and the national situation, it is feared that this is an official statement with political implications. The stated reason for the shift is to strengthen the armor needed to defend against horizontal water attacks. However, strengthening armor is stipulated in the Washington Treaty as anticipating future developments in aircraft and submarines, allowing an increase of up to 3,000 tons of armor on existing ships. New ships are at 35,000 tons, which implies this. Therefore, shifting due to armor is not a valid reason. In short, the United States, in order to maintain its Far East policy, has adopted a big ship policy aimed at warfare in the Far East, and there are reports of a reduced limit of 32,000 tons. Therefore, Britain's move to approach the US position is nothing more than a political maneuver to guide the disarmament conference through joint operations in the deep sea. Also, Britain has been advocating, in a gentlemanly manner, for thorough disarmament by reducing the existing treaty's 35,000 tons to 26,000 tons. This shift clearly indicates an intention to expand armaments and is contrary to the spirit of disarmament. If such a proposal appears, Japan will not be affected in the slightest, but will only advance in accordance with its established policy. (3rd, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British government recently invited the League of Nations to send observers to attend the London Naval Conference. It has been learned that the League of Nations Secretariat has appointed the head of the Disarmament Section, Greek national Mr. Aghnides, and Mr. Adams of the same section, to attend the conference in London. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's New York dispatch states that as the Naval Conference is about to open, it is becoming increasingly clear that the United States will advocate not involving political issues, while Japan wants to include political issues. The US government has not yet decided on its future policy toward the Far East. Now, some are advocating that it is better to withdraw from the Far East than to conflict with Japan. Proponents of this view say that when the Japanese interfere with the rights of foreigners within China, British interests are far greater than American interests. Therefore, the United States should stand by and let the British government take the lead. Although some support this view, it is not the opinion of the majority in US official circles. They believe that the United States can easily deter Japan by force and maintain the existing relationship, and that the Japanese militarists will soon be forced to change their policies because Japan's economy is becoming increasingly difficult and the Japanese people are becoming increasingly disappointed.

<h3>Strange Epidemic Discovered in Keshan Area of Heilongjiang, Forty Dead</h3>
<p>(Dalian) A strange epidemic has occurred in the Keshan area of Heilongjiang Province. Since November 21st, forty deaths are known, but the actual number is more than that.

Many doctors have now rushed to Heilongjiang to study the cause of the epidemic and implement rapid prevention measures. However, residents are fleeing, fearing the spread of the epidemic and official inspections, so the work of the doctors in preventing the epidemic is quite difficult to implement. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<h3>The Expansion of the World Aviation Network</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The Possibility of Circumnavigating the Globe in Ten Days</p>
<p>The American "China Clipper" giant aircraft recently completed the 8,000-mile Pacific journey in five days. This not only brings a leap forward in the transportation relationship between America and Asia, but also adds an important link to the world's aviation chain. From then on, this round earth, except for the lack of an air route over the North Atlantic, seems to be covered by an "invisible net." In the past, everyone regarded it as an oddity to circumnavigate the earth once in eighty days or four months. Now, according to American Raymon's speculation, in less than four years, we can circumnavigate the earth in ten days by plane. This is something the predecessors never dreamed of.</p>
<p>The completion of the global aviation network, connecting the major continents, has only happened in the last ten years. The international travel distance and time are shortened again and again, from a few weeks to a few days, and then from a few days to a few hours. Places that were always considered to be remote and unreachable are growing closer day by day. Communication and emotion between people are unconsciously becoming closer. The international aviation centers, starting from major cities in Europe and the United States, already have the following connections:</p>
<p>(1) The London airline can reach all of Europe. Going south from the British capital, flying over the back of Africa, all the way to Cape Town at the end. Then through Mesopotamia to India, Singapore, and finally over Timor Island to Australia.</p>
<p>(2) Paris: A person takes a plane from the French capital, first to Marseille, and then flies east to Saigon in Indochina, or flies southwest via Mediterranean ports. Letters can go straight to Senegal, the Cape Verde Islands, across the Atlantic Ocean to Natal, Brazil.</p>
<p>(3) Berlin: Starting an air journey from the German capital, if going to Soviet Russia, you can go directly to Moscow or Leningrad. Another route, via Spain, reaches Dakar on the West African coast, and then to various cities on the west coast of South America.</p>
<p>(4) Amsterdam, Netherlands, is an important city in the Netherlands. The airline runs through Central Europe from there, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, as far as Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies, a total of 9,000 miles.</p>
<p>(5) San Francisco: This is the newly completed Pan American Airline, which goes directly to Manila in the Philippines, passing through Hawaii, for a distance of 8,500 miles.</p>
<p>Britain, France, and the Netherlands, they all operate airlines to the East. The three lines are almost parallel to India. French and Germans are mutually developing the South Atlantic route, connecting Africa and South America. From then on, the European commercial center can echo the Americas and Africa.</p>
<p>The United States has three major airlines in the international aviation system. One, the Latin American system; two, the Alaskan system; three, the Chinese system of the Pan American Airline. This last system is the recently successfully launched Pacific Line. In the near future, it will be expanded south from Hawaii, the midpoint of this line, to New Zealand. In this way, the world's aviation network will be more complete. The first system mentioned above – Latin America – has a total route length of 32,000 miles, almost circumnavigating the periphery of South America, from Buenos Aires to New York in just five days.</p>
<p>The British Imperial Airline, in addition to the one from London to Cape Town, and the one via India to Australia, has another line connecting Singapore and Hong Kong. As for the North Atlantic line, it will not be difficult to achieve in the future. Currently, the Germans are working hardest on planning this line. The German Lufthansa airline is full of routes in Central Europe, and mail has been routed directly to South America via Africa. Recently, Mr. Parmentier, Chairman of the Dutch Royal Airline, stated that German aviation groups plan to conduct mail flights on the North Atlantic in the near future. This near future is said to be next year. Using aircraft carriers in the ocean as stopping points, just like the ones currently used in the South Atlantic. In addition to the airline to Soviet Russia, Germany also has the Eurasia Airline flying in China.</p>
<p>The recently completed Pacific line has been in preparation for several years. This summer, trial flights were carried out using various bases. When surveying this route, a large ship was specially hired to carry many experts to carry out the survey work. The total distance is almost 9,000 miles, on par with the line from Amsterdam to Surabaya in the Netherlands. The first stop is from California to Hawaii, and then via Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam, to Manila in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In the vast ocean, white and clean aviation bases are built on those small islands where originally only seabirds flew around and there were no traces of humans. They are used as rest stops for pilots and passengers. There are comfortable houses, hot water heaters in winter, and air conditioning in summer. Dining halls, kitchens, offices, clubs, flower and vegetable plantations, radio stations, floating docks, etc., all have everything you need. All the equipment is similar to that in the city, and living in it can make people forget that they are in the vast, turbulent ocean.</p>
<p>It has now become a reality that it takes five days to go from the Americas to the Far East. The next step is to travel around the world in ten days. As mentioned earlier, this plan is expected to be completed in four years. At that time, if a person starts from New York on a giant aircraft, they will reach Europe in one and a half days, Singapore or Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies in four days, and then transfer to Manila, fly across the Pacific Ocean (following the newly completed route), to San Francisco, and then cross the Americas in half a day to return to New York. The total time is exactly ten days. The shrinking of the earth that Fei Changfang dreamed of in ancient times can now be said to be realized.</p>

<h3>Tragedy at Wuhu Japanese Postal Ship Wharf: Multiple Drownings</h3>
<p>A Wuhu correspondent reports a tragic incident at the wharf of the Japanese Kinsei Yūsen shipping company (formerly Mitsubishi Corporation) at Yijishan, Wuhu, which serves as the sole lighter wharf for Japanese ships loading and unloading cargo. Iron ore gravel purchased by Japanese merchants upstream of the Yangtze River is usually transported to Wuhu by iron barges, stockpiled in the company's warehouses, and then transshipped for export by iron ships. The wharf loading and unloading operations are contracted by Chinese manager Le Junren, who employs many laborers, each receiving four copper coins per load carried. A Daido Maru iron ship that arrived from Shanghai recently berthed at the wharf to load iron ore. On the afternoon of the 2nd at 3 PM, while laborers were carrying cargo, dozens of them crowded onto the gangplank, shoulder to shoulder. Due to the gangplank being old and rotten, it could not bear the weight and suddenly broke in the middle. All the laborers on the gangplank fell into the river. The river is very deep and the current is swift at that location. Only Wang Xuechao, Zhao Quanshan, Tao Baosheng, Tao Ya Ba, and Tao Hu were rescued, but they all suffered injuries to their heads and bodies. They were transported by car to Huang Pure Ren Hospital for treatment. Later, the body of Tao Dehou was recovered with a grappling hook. The rest were carried away by the river and perished in the fish's bellies. However, the exact number of people who drowned is currently impossible to ascertain. Some say there were only a few, while others say there were more than ten. After the bad news spread, relatives rushed to the scene and wailed miserably. After the Japanese consulate received the news, the Japanese Head Jizhu Sadaharu, together with the Japanese Foreign Ministry Inspector Kitata Toji, the Police Chief Iwata Seita, and others, accompanied the Chief of the 5th Branch of our Public Security Bureau to the scene to investigate. On one hand, they reported to the local court for an autopsy. Then, they prepared coffins to collect the deceased. They then visited the injured at Huang Pure Ren Hospital. The families of the dead and injured laborers, many with wives, children, and elderly relatives, urgently need relief. The issue of post-incident matters and the exact number of drowned are currently being discussed and investigated. (Xia, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Founding Record of the Urban and Rural Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>After the Songhui Art Troupe incident, where members of the county fire association, including Li Ruizhi and others, were unjustly accused and sued for destroying the troupe, all members resigned in protest, and returned their uniforms to the association. Thereafter, in the event of a fire, they would provide assistance in plain clothes, not neglecting their duties despite their resignation. As a result, they were even more respected by the people of the town. After County Magistrate Li took office, he worked with various groups to persuade the members, pointing out their obligation to their community. They unanimously accepted, and it was decided to temporarily rename the association the Urban and Rural Fire Brigade in order to assist with winter fire prevention. The founding ceremony was held on the 1st at the association headquarters. Yesterday, County Magistrate Li inspected the brigade at the elementary school playground. After the brigade leaders, Cai Zhongyu and Tang Chengmei, reported on the founding process, a photograph was taken. The brigade leader then gave the order to demonstrate the water pumps. At that time, all fourteen pumps were simultaneously spraying water, creating a magnificent sight. More than a thousand spectators cheered loudly.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Ministry of Communications Investigates Radio Station Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Jiuda Wireless Radio Station in Suzhou North Bureau, founded by Mr. Li Baolin, was recently accused to the Ministry of Communications of emitting beyond its allocated frequency and violating regulations. The accusers requested an investigation and crackdown. The Ministry of Communications acted on this and sent Li Zhichang, an engineer from the Shanghai International Telecommunications Bureau, to Suzhou on the 3rd to investigate. Upon arriving in Suzhou, Engineer Li immediately went to the radio station to investigate in detail whether the transmission wattage was in violation of regulations. After the investigation, he immediately left Suzhou by train and returned to Shanghai to report back.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: New County Magistrate of Longyao Arrives in Wuxi to Take Office</h3>
<p>The newly appointed county magistrate, Long Tiyao, has received orders to be transferred to Wuxi and is currently waiting in Shishan for the handover. Zhang Mingjing, the newly appointed county magistrate of Baoshan, went on the 1st to take over. Long handled the handover and left Baoshan the following day to go to Shanghai and meet with former County Magistrate Wang, deciding to come to Wuxi to take office on the 3rd. The Finance Department ordered Wu Qiyun, the county magistrate of Wuxian, to come to Wuxi to supervise the inventory and instructed former County Magistrate Wang to compile a register of all funds under his administration within one month and send it to the successor for verification and settlement. Without a certificate of clear handover, he must not leave his post without authorization. Yesterday (3rd) at 12 noon, County Magistrate Wang returned to Wuxi from Shanghai and went directly to the county government, instructing each department to prepare for the handover. At 4:50 PM, the new County Magistrate Long arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai, accompanied by Secretary Wang Rongsan, Section Chief Huang Fu of the Second Department, Section Chief Fang Guoding of the Third Department, and staff members Lu Yi, Hong Zhou, and others, six people in total. Chen Yuchu, the chief of the local Public Security Bureau, and Shen Zhongli, the deputy leader of the 6th Security Brigade, and others led a team to welcome him at the station. After getting off the train, Long and his party rested in rooms 238 of the Railway Hotel. He is scheduled to go to the county to take over the official seal at 9 am this morning (4th). Li Taoxuan, the chief of the First Department, will come to Wuxi to work after the handover in Baoshan is completed.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Postal Bureau Rural Loans Begin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings Bureau, recognizing the rich rural area of this county, which has suffered from repeated disasters in recent years, has decided to open a postal rural loan office in Changshu to benefit the poor in order to revitalize the rural economy. The office was officially established on the 2nd. As for warehouse buildings, due to the urgency of time, private houses are currently being rented. The office location is still in the postal headquarters. Representatives of the local rice industry are in contact with Lu Gongquan and others due to the necessity of communication with this loan office, in order to facilitate future rural relief. The loan measures are currently being negotiated and drafted.</p>

<h3>Our Nation's Scientific Research Endeavors (Speech to National Secondary School Students on November 26th)</h3>
<p>— Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>Scientific research endeavors in China have only about twenty years of history. Among the central government's affiliated institutions are the Academia Sinica, the Peking Academy, the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Industrial Experiment Station, the Sericulture Improvement Association of the Economic Committee, the Cotton Improvement Institute, the Tea and Animal Husbandry Improvement Farms, the Hygiene Experiment Office, and laboratories affiliated with military organizations. Added to these are research institutes at various universities and research institutions affiliated with provincial governments, such as the Guangdong-Guangxi, Hunan, and Henan Geological Surveys. The funds used by the government for scientific research total more than 3.5 million yuan. In addition, there are private organizations, including the Jing Sheng Biological Research Institute in Beiping, the Huanghai Industrial Chemistry Research Society in Tanggu, the Nankai University Economic Institute in Tianjin, the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China in Nanjing, and the Western China Academy of Sciences in Chongqing. Their funding totals about 300,000 yuan. Therefore, the public and private sectors spend no less than four million yuan annually on scientific research.</p>
<p>It is, of course, impossible to explain the work achievements of public and private institutions in a few tens of minutes. Recently, Mr. Cai Yuanpei gave a systematic report in his memorial week lecture at the Sixth Plenary Session, which was published in the Central Daily News from November 5th to 8th, and you can refer to it. Today and in my next lecture on the 28th, I can only report to you on a few institutions that I know in the most detail.</p>
<p>The earliest established scientific research institution in China was the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry. In the first year of the Republic of China, the provisional government in Nanjing established a Geological Survey under the Bureau of Administration in the Ministry of Industry. In the second year of the Republic, the Beijing government changed it to the Geology Department, and in the third year, it was changed back to the Geological Survey, still under the Bureau of Mines. Fieldwork had already begun in the second year of the Republic. At the same time, in order to train technical personnel, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce jointly established a Geological Research Institute with Peking University. In the fifth year of the Republic, the Geological Survey was changed to the Geological Survey Bureau, independent of the Bureau of Mines. Although it was later changed from Bureau to Survey again, its nature was still an affiliated institution of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, different from before the fifth year of the Republic. The Geological Research Institute was closed down at the same time in the fifth year of the Republic, and the graduates were the basic staff of the Geological Survey Bureau at that time.</p>
<p>When the Geological Survey was first established, most of the work was to study China's mineral resources, especially coal and iron. The research on iron ore was guided by the Swedish geologist Mr. Anderson. From the fifth year of the Republic to the tenth year of the Republic, in five years, more than 100 million tons of new iron ore were discovered. At the same time, all important coalfields in the north underwent scientific research. As a result, we obtained relatively reliable estimates of China's coal and iron reserves for the first time. Many people know that 65 years ago, a famous German geologist, Baron Richthofen, came to China for a geological tour. He was in China for only two years, and the area he traveled was very wide, so he certainly could not do any detailed work. He saw coal everywhere in China—especially in the northern provinces—and at that time, the indigenous iron smelting method in Shanxi had not yet been affected by foreign steel. So he thought that China's coal and iron industry had an exceptionally bright future. Since then, people all over the world have believed that China is the country with the richest mineral resources, the second America. The German invasion of Jiaozhou in 1896 and the demands for mining rights by various countries were all influenced by his propaganda. After the establishment of the Geological Survey, after detailed research, we realized that on the one hand, new iron ore could be discovered, and on the other hand, the old-fashioned iron ore industry, such as Pingding, Luan, and Zezhou in Shanxi, had no possibility of existence. Although the amount of coal is much richer than iron ore, it is far less than what people generally imagine. In the "World's Coal Resources" published by the International Geological Congress in the second year of the Republic, it was said that China's coal reserves were as high as 99.6 billion. (A hundred million equals one trillion) The research of the Geological Survey only revealed that the actual coal reserves were less than a quarter of the above-mentioned amount, and the large coalfields are far from the coast, and there is not much coking bituminous coal. Therefore, the resources of China cannot be compared with those of Western Europe or North America.</p>
<p>The same is true for coal and iron, as well as for oil, copper, lead, gold, silver, and other minerals. These minerals are distributed over a considerable area, but the reserves are not very large. Only tungsten in Jiangxi, antimony in Hunan, and tin in Yunnan are our special products—especially tungsten and antimony. We can control the world market for these two metals.</p>
<p>The basic task of the Geological Survey is to measure the geological map of the whole country. The scale commonly used by the Geological Survey, except for particularly important locations, is 1:200,000. The published maps are partly 1:200,000 and partly 1:1,000,000. According to international agreement, each 1:1,000,000 geological map should include 4 degrees of latitude and 6 degrees of longitude. If Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, Qinghai, Xikang, and the three northeastern provinces are excluded, 30 maps are needed to cover the whole country. As a result of twenty years of effort, the measured area is only enough to make twelve maps. But the measured area is already over 1.5 million square kilometers!</p>
<p>In addition to researching mineral products and measuring geological maps, sciences related to geology, such as minerals, rocks, and paleontology, are of course also within the scope of the Geological Survey's work. Among them, paleontology is particularly important. Because to make a geological map, you must first know the classification of strata, and paleontology is the foundation of stratigraphy. In the ninth year of the Republic, the Geological Survey and Peking University jointly hired Professor Grabau, formerly of Columbia University in the United States, as the director of the Paleontology Group and professor at Peking University. Mr. Grabau soon trained a group of young people to do Chinese paleontology work. The Geological Survey publishes "Palaeontologia Sinica," which specializes in printing the results of this work. The first volume of "Palaeontologia Sinica" was published in the tenth year of the Republic. By the twenty-second year of the Republic, a total of 70 volumes had been published, with more than 6,400 pages. In addition to Chinese, there are works by paleontologists from England, the United States, Germany, France, and Sweden. "Palaeontologia Sinica" has become a very famous international publication. In addition to paleontology, the Geological Survey has also published 24 volumes of memoirs and 17 volumes of special reports, with a total of more than 7,000 pages. This is almost entirely the work of domestic geologists.</p>
<p>The above are all the duties of geologists. In recent years, in addition to its duties, the Geological Survey has also studied earthquakes, soil fuels, and prehistory.</p>
<p>The research on earthquakes is entirely the product of the personal interest of Mr. Weng Wenhao, the director of the Geological Survey. In the ninth year of the Republic, a major earthquake in Gansu killed more than 100,000 people. Mr. Weng was the acting director of the Geological Survey at that time. After returning from an investigation in Gansu, he paid attention to historical records about earthquakes in China. In the nineteenth year of the Republic, thanks to donations from friends, an earthquake room was built in the Western Hills of Beiping. There are two sets of Wiccher seismographs and three sets of Galilsin instruments, suitable for so-called first-class earthquake rooms. Since the nineteenth year, observations have continued, and a special report is published every two months, exchanging information with earthquake research in various countries around the world.</p>
<p>Soon after the establishment of the earthquake research laboratory, the Geological Survey was entrusted by the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture to organize a soil research laboratory. Two Americans were invited to preside over it. Slowly, many domestic young people were trained to do soil survey work. And a soil special report is issued, publishing the results of their work.</p>
<p>After many years of effort in fieldwork, everyone gradually felt that there was little hope of discovering large amounts of oil in China. Therefore, the Geological Survey gradually paid attention to the problem of refining gasoline by using coal. At first, it also received private donations, and recently it has also received subsidies from the Economic Committee. A fuel research laboratory is being built in Nanjing, specializing in low-temperature distillation and hydrogenation, hoping to use our coal to supply our gasoline needs in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Cenozoic Geological Research Laboratory, which is cooperating with the Peking Union Medical College. In the tenth year of the Republic, Mr. Andersson discovered vertebrate fossils at Zhoukoudian, 100 miles away from Beiping. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the Geological Survey received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and invited Mr. Black, the director of the Anatomy Department of the Peking Union Medical College, as honorary director. Mr. Yang Zhongjian and Mr. Pei Wenzhong began large-scale excavations in the Zhoukoudian limestone cave. Soon, the bones of the so-called "Peking Man" (Sinanthropus pekinensis) were discovered. This is one of the oldest races in the world. So far, the remains of more than twenty people have been obtained. And there are stone tools and traces of the use of fire. This is a great contribution to the world's prehistoric studies. Therefore, almost no one in the international scientific community is unaware of the importance of the work of the Geological Survey of China.</p>
<p>This is a brief history of the earliest scientific research institution in our country. Now, most people know about the achievements of the Geological Survey, but few people understand the secrets of its success and the sacrifices of the parties involved. Since the Republic of China, the Beijing government has established many research institutions besides the Geological Survey, why is only this one so outstanding and praised by society?

<h3>The Central, China, and Communications Banks Confer Yesterday to Implement Overdrafts for Fellow Banks. All Banks and Firms are Ordered to Accept Mortgaged Real Estate According to Regulations. The Mortgage Bank Will Be Established Soon. The Chamber of Commerce Cancels the "Drawing Heads" and Sends a Letter Requesting a Balanced Exchange Rate.</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports: After the Central, China, and Communications Banks were ordered to handle overdrafts for fellow banks, they conferred yesterday to implement it. The Banking and Money Industry Association notified member banks and firms to accept mortgages according to regulations. The Central Bank handled rediscounting, and the market gradually became active. The practice of "drawing heads" and "adding water" in the banking and money industry was cancelled. The Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Money Industry Association requesting deliberations on a balanced exchange rate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Three Banks Handle Overdrafts for Fellow Banks</p>
<p>After the Central, China, and Communications Banks received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to handle overdrafts for fellow banks, the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Xi Demao, the Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, Bei Songsun, and the Manager of the Business Bureau of the Bank of Communications, Zhang Peishen, held a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. after the meeting of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee of the Central Bank to continue discussing the handling of overdrafts for fellow banks. It was decided to follow the previous method of handling interbank lending, with the Central Bank in charge, and the daily interbank lending rate would be announced daily. All banks and money industry firms can apply for overdrafts. It is said that the total overdraft amount is between 10 million and 20 million yuan, which will be decided at any time according to market needs, and will be recognized in a 4-4-2 system.</p>
<p>Banking and Money Industries Accept Mortgages</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that it should handle the mortgaging of factories and land by manufacturers according to regulations, the reporter of the New Voice News Agency visited the Secretary-General of the Banking Association, Lin Kanghou, yesterday. He said that it was decided to copy the original text of the instructions and forward it to the member banks for compliance. Inquiries with the Money Industry Association revealed that it was decided to submit it to the Standing Committee meeting this Saturday for discussion before notifying the member money firms to comply.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Specialized Real Estate Bank</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of a real estate mortgage lending bank, the Ministry of Finance is preparing to establish it in the shortest possible time to meet the needs. The Central Bank's handling of rediscounting matters, since receiving the letter from the Ministry of Finance, has been handed over to the Business Bureau for handling, ordering the Deputy Director of the Bureau and Director of the Lending and Rediscounting Section, Hu Meian, to draft measures, which will be implemented after approval by President Kong Xiangxi. In the future, the bank will also announce the bill rediscounting rate every two days. All banks and money industry firms can apply to the bank for rediscounting for the discounted bills.</p>
<p>Implementation of Cancellation of "Drawing Heads" and "Adding Water"</p>
<p>Since the government stipulated legal tender, the Banking Association resolved to eliminate the "drawing heads" (i.e., for money firms' interbank collection and transfer of funds, those that can be offset and reconciled at the general association of drawing heads in the evening cannot be cashed, and if they want to be cashed, they must be done the next day). "Drawing heads" were therefore current funds (therefore, those who owed "drawing heads" funds could not repay them with "drawing heads" funds). After leveling, there was in fact no so-called "drawing heads." Now the Money Industry Association has also decided on five measures to implement the cancellation of "drawing heads" on December 1st. Therefore, the "drawing heads" and "adding water" rate announced by the money market every afternoon has been cancelled.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Balanced Exchange Rate</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, under the order of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to restrict the exchange rate of silver coins, yesterday forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Money Industry Association for deliberation. The original letter stated: "Since the reform of the monetary policy, your market has received face-to-face instructions from Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance that each legal tender can be exchanged for 12 jiao of silver subsidiary coins and 3,000 wen of copper coins, and a notice has been issued to comply with it. However, in recent times, the exchange rate of legal tender in the market, regardless of silver subsidiary coins or copper coins, has not been followed, and has been arbitrarily lowered, which is no small matter for the livelihood of ordinary people. Accordingly, we are ordered to send this letter, hoping that your association will examine and discuss how to balance the exchange rate of legal tender and whether there is a need for joint consultation, and reply for verification."</p>

<h3>Minister of Interior Huang Fu Requests Resignation by Telegram. Protracted Illness Makes it Difficult to Undertake Heavy Responsibilities.</h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: Minister of Interior Huang Fu previously repeatedly requested resignation due to his illness, but President Wang of the Executive Yuan repeatedly persuaded him to stay and encouraged him to undertake heavy responsibilities. Now, Huang's illness has still not healed, and yesterday morning (the 3rd) he sent another telegram to the Executive Yuan and President Wang, requesting approval of his resignation. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>"Regarding the request for resignation, I have repeatedly requested resignation due to my protracted illness, making it difficult to undertake heavy responsibilities, but I have not been granted approval, which makes me deeply apprehensive. Now my illness has still not healed, and treatment will take time. Considering the importance of the ministry's affairs, if I continue to delay taking office, how can I live up to the government's expectations? After repeated consideration, I can only express my feelings again and request resignation to avoid the blame for delay. I hereby submit this document requesting your approval, and I will be extremely grateful for your consideration and prompt appointment of a competent successor."</p>
<p>Telegram to President Wang</p>
<p>"Today I read in the newspaper that I have received your telegram, and I am saddened to learn that your health has still not recovered and that you are requesting resignation from all your posts. Since I was ordered to take charge of the Ministry of Interior, I have felt that my health is weak and that it is difficult to shoulder heavy responsibilities. I have repeatedly expressed my feelings and applied for resignation, but I have not been granted approval and have been repeatedly persuaded to stay in order to maintain the current situation. Now that the Fifth National Congress has been successfully completed, and since you are unable to continue due to your poor health and are firmly resigning from all your posts, I am even more unable to hold a nominal position for a long time due to my illness. Therefore, I have formally resigned again. I am grateful for your teachings over the years. I especially send this telegram for your consideration. Huang Fu."</p>

<h3>City Government Expands Memorial Week: Cai Zengji Reports on Municipal Problems; Municipal Administration Should Be Close to the People, Strictly Implement Austerity to Cope with the Environment</h3>
<p>The municipal government held an expanded Memorial Week on the 2nd of this month (lunar calendar). It was decided that Finance Bureau Director Cai Zengji would attend and give a report. The following is a transcript of Mr. Cai's speech that day. "At this Memorial Week, I (Cai, referring to himself) am very happy to have the opportunity to gather with my colleagues. However, financial personnel have always been reluctant to speak much. Even if they do, they must never deviate from the facts. But only speaking the truth is something ordinary people are unwilling to hear. The world is full of people with this problem. What I want to report today are just a few facts. Every time I attend Memorial Week, I always have a feeling when I respectfully read the Premier's will. The instructions in the Premier's will are all familiar to us, and there is no need to repeat them. However, the phrase 'The revolution has not yet succeeded' is enough to keep us on our guard. Now, in terms of our service to the city, improving governance and eliminating abuses is our duty. Are all things now being restored? Are all abuses eliminated? If there are still things that have not been completely achieved, it means that the city has not yet succeeded. Therefore, after respectfully reading the Premier's will, we should strive forward to find a path to success. The task of the city is very heavy. Before the industrial revolution, it focused on rural problems. Therefore, the sages advocated cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. However, after thousands of years, the rural problem has not been solved. After the industrial revolution, all kinds of complex social and economic problems arose accordingly. The status of cities gradually became important. For example, providing social services, equally distributing social resources, and improving housing are all responsibilities of urban governments in the advancement of 20th-century civilization. Modern politicians and municipal experts have conducted considerable research and agree that using commercialization/Corporation is the best way to manage a city. The most important meaning is to bring the government closer to the people, work together, and make it easier for the city to develop. For example, in business, shop owners and shop assistants must do everything possible to attract customers for their business to flourish. There has never been a case where customers ask someone to introduce them to the shop owner or shop assistant before coming to trade. Although our country's municipal administration has a rough framework, it is still separated from the people. For example, when people make requests to the government or contact the relevant authorities on a certain case, they often have to go through someone to be introduced to the government before it can be resolved. At the same time, the relevant authorities often do not provide convenience to the people, or even make things difficult in various ways, resulting in cases being unresolved for years. All of this not only causes suffering to the people, but also does not benefit the government. This belongs to the issue of city organization, and the central government will naturally conduct fundamental research and improvement in the future. However, we have a responsibility to be close to the people. If there are similar facts, we should reduce them as much as possible within our capabilities. As for the internal matters that should be paid attention to, there are many, but the most important thing is to have a strict organization and establish credit. For example, in terms of hiring people, are there any excesses or violations of regulations? Are the employees loyal to their duties? Are there any who are paid but do not come to work? Are there any who hold multiple positions and receive multiple salaries? Furthermore, in terms of business, are there any that are unreasonable or uneconomical? If there are no such facts, then credit will naturally become more and more solid, and the city will have the possibility of development. I have been in charge of the city's finances for more than four years. I am deeply ashamed of not being able to offer any advice. Last year, due to the implementation of reconstruction and relief projects, I was ordered to raise funds totaling more than 10 million yuan. I only fulfilled my humble responsibility in finance. In the future, business will continue to flourish, such as the development of the city center and the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan. We must have sufficient financial resources and establish credit so that people have deep faith before we can slowly progress. It is not enough to just have material construction. Our city is being hit by the adverse wave of the global recession, and the economy is declining day by day. Whether it will continue to evolve in the future is difficult to predict. Therefore, during this period, whether it is commercial groups or government agencies, they must strictly implement austerity measures in order to cope with the environment. Due to the decline of the social economy, the city's finances are inevitably affected. However, if we can be of one mind and cooperate in planning and work hard to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, then the future is still optimistic. Recalling the Northern Expedition in 1926, because everyone had the determination to sacrifice, the result was success. This is what the sage said, 'Place yourself in a deadly position and then you will live.' It is true. Also, during the European War, Turkey was attacked by the Allied forces and was almost divided. Later, Kemal, the ruler of the country, voluntarily retreated to Ankara. The city was a medieval city with simple facilities and inconvenient transportation (the city's transportation to the coast was only a single-track railway). However, with the firm and decisive spirit of the people above and below, it was able to maintain its independence and resist the Allied forces, and gradually became a strong country. The difficult situation in our city is far less than that of the Northern Expeditionary Army in 1926 and Turkey during the European War. The responsibilities we bear are also lighter than theirs. If we can unite and work hard, all difficult problems in the future can be solved easily."</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Clive, Passes Through Shanghai Again; Returns to Japan to Resume His Post Without Delay</h3>

<h3>City Federation Sends a Telegram of Congratulations to the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a telegram of congratulations to the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee yesterday, saying: "To all the committee members of the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee in Nanjing: The national crisis is serious, and the people's livelihood is suffering. Fortunately, all of you committee members have come to the capital to jointly plan the country's affairs, to save the people from fire and water, to lay the foundation of the country on a firm foundation, to consolidate our borders, to provide sufficient food and soldiers, to comfort the people's expectations, and to correct international views. The whole country is fortunate, and the people are fortunate. We respectfully send a telegram of congratulations with boundless respect. Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, Jiang."</p>
<h3>Actively Promoting Commercial Acceptance Bills</h3>
<p>Various Industries Actively Proceeding</p>
<p>In January of this year, Mr. Luo Qinghua, the supervisor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, proposed the implementation of commercial acceptance bills to provide relief due to the extremely tight money supply and sluggish currency circulation. At that time, the silk and satin industry and the electrical machinery silk weaving industry decided to adopt it first and agreed with the Silk Industry Bank to handle discounting business. Mr. Luo then requested the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all industry associations to promote it together and the Chamber of Commerce specially organized lectures and invited economic experts to explain the benefits of implementing this important document. It has aroused the deep attention of various industries, and the number of those who have adopted it one after another is increasing. Since the government explicitly ordered the centralized issuance and management of currency on the 4th of this month, the Central Bank will handle re-discounting business. A few days ago, representatives of seventy industry associations in the city petitioned the Minister of Finance, and Vice Minister Xu said in person that the Central Bank would accept legal bills for re-discounting as much as possible. Therefore, the circulation of acceptance bills will become more and more common. It is reported that industry associations such as the knitting industry in the city are not clear about the application procedures of this bill and have successively invited Mr. Luo Qinghua to give lectures. A few days ago, Mr. Luo received a letter from Li Zongwen, a representative of industry associations such as the cotton industry, ginned cotton industry, yarn industry, and flower industry, saying that the current market conditions are not good and the financial situation is tight. Acceptance bills can increase chips and circulate funds, which is a good opportunity to deal with the current emergency. All industry associations are willing to actively promote it. Mr. Luo is the pioneer of acceptance bills, and your bank is the pioneer of the pilot project. We are entrusted to organize it and we will follow your teachings as a compass. It is reported that Mr. Luo has replied and made an appointment to meet. Because Mr. Luo noted that some industries are not clear about the meaning of this bill, he printed sample acceptance bills, implementation procedures, discounting instructions, discounting application forms, etc. for the reference of various industries. You can write to the Silk Industry Bank for them.</p>
<p>Commercial Press Adopts</p>
<p>The Commercial Press is scheduled to adopt commercial acceptance bills from December 10th. The museum has a good reputation and is highly respected by all walks of life. Therefore, customers who usually trade with the museum can also mortgage to the bank only with the museum's receipt. The bank is also happy to accommodate and accept it, because the museum has stipulated dates for various payments, regardless of the amount. Since the government authorities and the financial community have promoted commercial acceptance bills, the industrial and commercial circles have gradually followed suit. The museum, as the leader of the book industry, first expressed its approval of this bill and is actively preparing for it in order to promote it widely. At the same time, the banking community has also repeatedly persuaded it to do so so that it can be realized as soon as possible. Now that all preparations have been completed, it is stipulated that customers who trade with the museum, whose deliveries each time are more than 100 yuan in national currency, may first apply for acceptance of half of the amount, and the remaining amount will still be paid according to the original regulations. In the event of returns or shortages, it will be deducted from the second half. The museum has also negotiated with several banks in this city on the payment and discounting procedures for acceptance bills in order to facilitate customers, and strives for preferential treatment and convenience. Even small factories that have no bank relationship can freely use the acceptance bills. The detailed regulations have been notified by the museum to all customers, which has been praised by all parties. The museum's grand scale and outstanding reputation make it a great help for the promotion of the bill after it resolutely adopts the commercial acceptance bill. On the one hand, the indirect and direct borrowing of small factories' funds will be used for flexible turnover, which is also not a small number.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Exports Increased Last Month; Totaling 5,970 Bales in the Second Half of the Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau announced yesterday the statistics of raw silk exports in the second half of last month (16th to 30th): "Waste silk was shipped to Europe in 675 bales, to the United States in 193 bales, and to other places in 1,037 bales, totaling 1,905 bales. The total number of double cocoon silk exports was 213 bales, gray silk was 40 bales, yellow soil silk was 278 bales, yellow silk was 73 bales, white soil silk was 179 bales, Zhili silk was 337 bales, yellow factory silk was 10 bales, and white factory silk was 2,935 bales. The total exports totaled 5,970 bales. If the number of waste silk exports is excluded, it would be 4,065 bales, an increase of 940 bales compared to the first half of the month. The yin fraction of waste silk was 939 bales."</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Association Actively Raising Relief Funds; Soy Sauce Commission Helps Relief, Purchasers are Very Enthusiastic; Chrysanthemum Amusement Helps Relief, Notes have Been Sent to Urge Collection of Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association has stated that the floods in various places this year have been extremely severe, more than ever before. Now that winter is approaching, the north wind is raging, and people are suffering from hunger and cold. If they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death. Therefore, this relief work cannot be delayed for a moment. The Flood Relief Association is pleading for the victims on behalf of the victims, appealing to all parties for donations, and successively holding various entertainments to use the income as relief funds. Since the beginning of the fundraising, it has been deeply sympathetic to all sectors of society and has received enthusiastic support, so the effect is also significant. This time, Mr. Shen Yanghou, the manager of the Jiangwan China Rural Chemical Manufacturing Factory in the city, felt this and specially designated the factory's Sanxian soy sauce to be used for commission-based relief. Lianjun was commissioned to sell it, which has been going on for many days. It is now learned that this method has been deeply sympathetic to all sectors of society, and the number of sales is extremely large. Because soy sauce is a daily necessity for households, and the purpose of the factory's event is to save lives and does not aim to operate as a business. The Sanxian soy sauce that is currently produced is purely made according to scientific principles and absolutely avoids oleic acid preservatives, so all sectors of society are happy to buy and use it. Purchasers can benefit the victims and be practical, which is a two-pronged benefit. However, please pay attention to all sectors of society. If you hold this payment voucher, please go to the temporary office of the Fundraising Team of the Association to pay the money and stamp it in order to notify the factory to deliver the goods at any time. In addition, the Chrysanthemum Amusement Relief Association, which the Water Disaster Association held with the New New Company, has ended for many days. However, some of the voucher funds have not been delivered. The fundraising team of the Association sent out many letters of reminder yesterday, asking all sectors of society to submit the voucher funds to the fundraising team of the Water Disaster Association on the third floor of the Baxianqiao Youth Association within three days after receiving the letter, in order to clear the procedures and send them to the disaster area to expand relief efforts. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully: In order to raise donations for disaster relief, our association held a Disaster Relief Chrysanthemum Competition Amusement Conference in the rooftop garden of the New New Company on November 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. The income was used for disaster relief. We previously sent door tickets for recognition and sale. We have not received the above-mentioned voucher funds for many days. Now, in order to rush to the end and send them to the disaster area for relief, we specially send a letter of reminder. We hope you will check and send the voucher funds to the temporary office of our Fundraising Team on the third floor of the Baxianqiao Youth Association within three days after receiving the letter in order to clear the procedures."</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company Has Received Pingliang Radio Station Report on the Accident of Aircraft No. 5; Two Passengers are Gradually Recovering Their Health</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, after the Eurasia Airline's No. 5 aircraft crashed in Lingtai County on the Xilan section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang line on the 27th of last month, the company sent an acting director of the air navigation team to investigate. Yesterday morning, according to Zhu Qin'ao, the company's secretary, when talking to reporters about the circumstances of the accident of aircraft No. 5, it was reported by Pingliang Radio Station that He En had arrived at the scene of the accident on the afternoon of the 2nd. The remains of the deceased pilot Fu Fromm and the mechanic Meia have been encoffined on the spot and will be transported to Shanghai within days to determine the burial site. The biggest cause of the accident was the weather, because the winter is severe, the wind and snow are heavy, and the weather changes frequently. Therefore, before the accident, the company had leased a Junkers "U" 52" giant aircraft (the same as the previous two) with three engines from Germany in mid-month to fly the Xilan section. Now, the German side informed that the aircraft will leave Berlin for China on the 20th of this month and will arrive in Shanghai around the 27th, and will join the line. As for the injured passengers, one is the current president of the Qinghai Local Court, and the other is the magistrate of Huining County, Shaanxi. At that time, they were frightened and unconscious after the plane crashed. After being sent to Xi'an for treatment, they have gradually recovered their health and are now able to write letters home themselves, out of the danger period."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plans to Repair River Vessels and Lighters; Jiangyu Vessel Needs to be Repaired After Being Hit; Wan Steamer Explodes, Sending a Replacement Vessel</h3>
<p>Jiangyu Overhaul</p>
<p>The Changjiang River vessel Jiangyu of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has an open-wheel engine. Although the vessel is old (54 years old), the hull is excellent, with a load capacity of 2,100 tons. It is currently running on the Beijing-Hankou route and is used for official business. Last time, on its way from Beijing to Hankou, it had just left Pukou when it encountered a small boat towing three rows of wooden rafts sailing downstream. When the Jiangyu met the boat, it was unable to avoid it and was suddenly hit. The open-wheel engine on the left side was damaged. At that time, because of business in Hankou, it could not return to Shanghai for major repairs, so it had to reluctantly tow it to Hankou, unload the cargo, and immediately report it to the authorities to lift the charter and open it to Shanghai for major repairs. It arrived in Shanghai on the 27th of last month. After inspection by engineer Huang Zonglun and technicians from various shipyards, it was found that the damage to the left wheel was extremely serious, and the iron plates of the anchor hole below the waterline of the bow were also rusted. It was impossible to sail without major repairs. The repair price has been estimated by various shipyards. Yiesheng is cheaper, while Jiangnan is more expensive. It has been submitted to the Bureau Affairs Meeting for discussion in order to publicly decide which factory to hand over for major repairs. It can be determined in one or two days.</p>
<p>Wan Steamer Explosion</p>
<p>There is a large lighter at the Anqing Wharf for stacking passenger and cargo to and from central Anhui, with a capacity of 500 tons. However, the lighter has been in disrepair for a long time and has suddenly collapsed. River water is pouring in. At that time, there was a large amount of cargo piled up in the ship. The staff of the Anhui Bureau and the lighter's employees immediately gathered all the employees and dock workers to rush to rescue the cargo in each cabin of the lighter and move it to the shore. Fortunately, the handling was swift and the final verification was rescued. The water has already entered three feet. Today, the Anhui Bureau has telegraphed the Shanghai General Bureau, saying that it is fortunate that it has not been sunk. Now it is trying to temporarily repair the cracked bottom of the ship and then pump out the accumulated water to carry out major repairs. The General Bureau is also planning to send a ship to replace the Anhui lighter.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Trade Association and Production and Sales Association Jointly Hosted a Banquet for Song Faxiang Yesterday; More Than 40 Representatives of Manufacturers Attended; Industrial and Trade Association Also Held a Board Meeting at 5 O'Clock</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association jointly hosted a banquet for Consul General Song Faxiang stationed in Batavia (Jakarta) at Jinlong Restaurant at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road at 7 p.m. yesterday. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association also held a board meeting at the same place at 5 p.m. to discuss the association's affairs and resolved many important cases. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Banquet for Song Faxiang Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association jointly hosted a banquet for Song Faxiang at Jinlong Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 7 p.m. yesterday. The manufacturer representatives who attended included Du Bingshou of the Home Industry Cooperative, Zhang Huikang of the Yaguang Electric Wood Company, Cai Shengbai of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Hu Xiyuan of the China Yale Ear Factory, He Bingxian, Yu Zuoting, and dozens of others. First, Chairman Zhang Huikang introduced Consul General Song to give a speech, followed by Consul Song's thank-you speech, which roughly said that he was deeply grateful for the association's hospitality today. The overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are very willing to promote national products from their home country. Domestic manufacturers should improve their goods, and the goods should meet the needs of the locals. The association's promotion of exports is a very good thing, because without a group organization, it is impossible to compete with others. I hope that the association will actively focus on the Southeast Asian market. Finally, thank you for the delegate's seat and thank you to all the members. The meeting ended at about 10 p.m. At the same time, four members of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, namely Wuhe Weaving Factory, China Underwear Company, Zhenhua Shantou Paint Company, and Guan Le Ming Fountain Pen, also hosted a banquet for all members of the association at the same place.</p>
<p>Industrial and Trade Association Holds a Board Meeting</p>
<p>The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association also held its fourth board meeting at the Jinlong Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 5 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Zhang Huikang and Recorder Wang Zhongchu first reported the association's guiding principles: (1) focusing on actual sales work, (2) contacting government agencies and requesting assistance from time to time, (3) research and investigation work, (4) the situation of the Singapore Exhibition, and other association affairs. Then, several important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) The Secretariat Department prepared to formulate the detailed rules for the Secretariat Department and hire staff. It was resolved to pass the establishment of the Secretariat, one secretary, and handle all association affairs under the direction of the board of directors. The number of secretaries should be as large as possible, and Hu Shicheng, Guo Yongkang, Gao Shiheng, Liang Bozhi, Jin Songtang, Wu Dejun, Zhang Zuyin and other nine people were hired as secretaries. (2) The association's budget was discussed and resolved. (3) The government's assistance plan for the foreign sales group (named the Southeast Asia Inspection Group) was resolved to be left for discussion at the next board meeting. (4) The reception plan for the German inspection group was resolved and agreed to be jointly hosted with other groups. (5) The plan to hire specialized committee members was discussed and resolved.</p>
<h3>National Products and Local Goods for Export are Allowed to be Exempt from Dredging Donation for One Year to Show Sympathy for the Difficulties of Merchants; The Customs Will Issue a Notice to Implement It Soon</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Times News Agency, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau previously received appeals from various groups such as the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the commercial sector had been particularly depressed in recent years due to the impact of the economic downturn. The government authorities were trying to reduce the collection of export taxes and donations to provide relief and show sympathy for the difficulties of merchants. As for exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, they were all exempted. However, the dredging donation is still collected at present, which is contrary to the government's original intention of providing relief to commerce. It is requested that all national products and local goods for export be exempt from dredging donations in order to directly reduce the burden on merchants and indirectly seek the development of the cargo business. The Bureau considered that the above-mentioned points were still true, and it has turned to the Ministry of Finance to apply for approval to exempt the dredging donation for the export of domestic goods. The exemption is only for one year to show sympathy for the difficulties of merchants. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has adopted the suggestion and will order the Jianghai Customs to issue a notice for implementation soon.</p>

<h3>Chen Xihou Returned to China Yesterday from Italy</h3>
<p>Chen Xihou, former training minister of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, who had previously served as a standing committee member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters and a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was sent to the United States for studies by the Zhejiang Provincial Government in the autumn of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931]. After studying in the United States for two years, he went to England, France, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Greece, and other countries for investigation. He returned to China on an Italian ship yesterday morning. Ten relatives and friends from Shanghai went to the port to welcome him. As the reporter knew that Mr. Chen had been engaged in the revolution for many years and had returned from a long journey, he must have gained a lot of experience and had a plan for saving the country. Therefore, he asked him to express his opinions on the investigation. Mr. Chen declined several times, saying that at this time of national crisis, all Chinese should do their best to save the situation. At the recent Fifth National Congress of the Central Committee, there were detailed resolutions on diplomacy and domestic affairs. If we can follow the central government's resolutions and strive for strength, that is the way to save the country. He, personally, had been abroad for three years and did not know much about national affairs because he could not read newspapers regularly. However, in his personal opinion, most compatriots seem to have too weak a concept of the nation. Therefore, firstly, he advocated that we must truly recognize ourselves as Chinese, and always live as Chinese and die as Chinese ghosts. Secondly, we are not slaves of a conquered nation, and we must insist on not being interfered with by anyone in everything we do. Thirdly, we are poor, but our wealth is not small. Our military power is not strong, but the strength of our people is great enough. Therefore, developing wealth, revitalizing industry, and organizing the people to be the backing of military power are what we should all strive for. Fourthly, we must follow the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, catch up with the spirit, and build a new modern country, so that the terms "cultural and economic backwardness" will not be allowed to remain in China for the shortest possible time. Comrade Chen has always worked hard for party affairs and has traveled all over the world this time. He must have done a lot of research on the political parties of various countries. He does not know what opinions he has. Comrade Chen replied that no matter what political party is under any kind of political system, the first thing is that there must be a sound leader to lead the whole party, so that the effect of commanding the whole party can be achieved. The so-called iron discipline and iron organization can only occur under the leadership of the leader. Otherwise, one country with three dukes is certainly not good, and one party with multiple leaders is not a good strategy. It is a pity that the central government did not adopt the leadership system this time. In addition to the central government adopting the leadership system, the provincial and municipal governments should adopt a departmental autocracy or secretary system in order to achieve unified command. In addition, attention should be paid to training party members, so that the quality of the party is strong, and the strength of the party will naturally increase. Governing the country by the party is the trend of modern new-style politics. If we can bury our heads and work hard, we will have a strong day.</p>
<h3>Tianmen Continues to Seek Winter Relief</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, together with the Renji Road Huayang Yizhen Society and the Wuchang Changchun Guan Tongshan Society, jointly handled the water disaster relief in the Tianmen 1583 area. The total cost was 14,730.057 yuan, which has been completed and reported in the previous newspaper. The association has now received letters from Ji Guozhen and Hou Yongde of Hankou, saying that Hubei Province has suffered a severe catastrophe this year. Fortunately, your association has investigated and released urgent relief in the Tianmen area. The survivors of the disaster have benefited greatly. However, during this winter, there are still many people who are hungry and cold and waiting to be fed. Yesterday, Wu Youqing came to Hankou to talk about the disaster victims in the county. Many people are sick due to freezing and starvation. They are seen sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind. The situation is very miserable. If winter relief is not continued, the dying disaster victims will soon die. Now, our office has raised more than 1,000 yuan and 500 sets of cotton clothes, but the number is very small and it is difficult to solve the problem. We still ask your association to show great compassion and help start winter relief, so that the old and the young can enjoy the rain and dew. I think the benefactors are old-fashioned, and their compassion is eager, and they will be happy to follow it. The association was very sympathetic to the reported tragedy. However, the source of donations has become the end of the crossbow. It is hoped that the benevolent people at home and abroad will develop the heart of Bodhi and the wish of the universal door to generously donate money to save these frozen and starving disaster victims.</p>
<h3>International Art Club Will Perform the Play "Lysistrata"</h3>
<p>"Lysistrata"</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Art Club will publicly perform Aristophanes' masterpiece "Lysistrata" at the Guanglu Grand Theater for three days on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month. When the famous play "Lysistrata" was publicly performed in the Americas, it caused a sensation and was known to everyone. The plot is about an ancient country where the people love war, and some have fought for 20 years. However, the women of the country hate war, so they agreed not to be intimate with their lovers unless their lovers obey their anti-war doctrine, which led to various jokes. It is said that the premiere of the play will definitely be crowded. People in Shanghai who want to watch the famous play can go to Molidel Foreign Company on Nanjing Road to buy tickets in advance. People from all walks of life should not miss it.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Road, Shengshun Lane Tenants Demand Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The houses in Shengshun Lane, Baoshan Road, have been built for more than 20 years and are owned by Shengshun Company. All the tenants in the lane have suffered heavy losses since the January 28th Incident, but the rent has increased, which is a heavy burden. Recently, due to the impact of the current situation, all the three-room tenants have moved away, causing the two-room tenants who cannot move to suffer both mentally and economically. Therefore, yesterday, all the tenants gathered together to discuss the cases and asked the owner to consider the real hardship and give them a rent reduction to ease the burden and maintain the market. The details of the resolutions are as follows: (1) Reduce the rent to 80% of the original price. (2) Due to the impact of the current situation, the rent for October, November, and December will be waived. (3) The rent for the houses in this lane is not uniform, and the difference between the same houses is as much as one time, which is quite unreasonable. In the future, new and old tenants should be treated equally. (4) Before the rent reduction movement is resolved, all tenants will unanimously suspend paying the rent. (5) A letter will be sent to Shengshun Company in the name of all tenants, requesting recognition of the above resolutions and a written reply within five days.</p>

<h3>The Shipping Industry Public Conference Decides to Increase Water Freight by 20%. It Will Be Implemented After Submission to the General Assembly for Retroactive Approval.</h3>
<p>After the decline of China's shipping industry, the number of ships that stopped sailing rose sharply. The request to issue 10 million yuan of shipping public bonds has been repeatedly rejected. The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association heard that the price of goods was soaring, and the price of hardware materials, machinery, and iron plates needed by the shipping industry soared due to foreign exchange relations. Moreover, the daily necessities of coal and firewood have been increased in price, which has made the expenses of the ships larger and the support is more difficult. After the 37th Executive Committee meeting decided, in order to remedy the situation, starting from January 1, 1936, the water freight of each line will be increased by 20%. The municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the municipal Chamber of Commerce were immediately requested to file for record, and then submitted to the General Assembly for retroactive approval before being announced for implementation.</p>

<h3>Xiang Yixin Case Two Hometown Bandits are Executed. Wan Junming and Other Four Bandits are Sentenced to Life Imprisonment.</h3>
<p>Xiang Yixin, the owner of the Xiang Xingchang foundry machine factory at No. 158 Ou Jialu, Hongkou, was kidnapped by bandits at the end of Gonghe Road, Zhabei, at 7 am on July 20 this year, and demanded 500,000 yuan to redeem him. Later, Gu Liancheng, the captain of the third team of the Detective Brigade, successively arrested the bandits Zheng Jinshui and others, found out the place where the hostages were hiding, and rescued Xiang Yixin from danger in a small boat in Wangjiadu, Sanlintang, Pudong, late on August 19. The bandits were sent to the Procuratorate of the local court for interrogation. The public prosecution was filed because each defendant was actually an accomplice to Article 347, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Judge He Jingcen was ordered to seek details and summon witnesses for questioning several times to conclude the case. The situation has been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case was pronounced by Judge He at 3 pm yesterday. In order to be cautious, the interrogating officer ordered Police Chief Zhang Shuping to supervise four bailiffs to take care of the surrounding areas of the court to provide security. After the judge took office, he ordered 11 men and women, including Zheng Jinshui and Lu Zhangshi, to be brought to court. Pan Renxi, the defendant's lawyer, also attended the court to listen. The interrogating officer first briefly questioned each defendant about his age and origin, and then stood up in court and announced that Zheng Jinshui and Ji Weiqing were each sentenced to death. According to Zheng, he was the main criminal who drove the hostage's car, and Ji was the main criminal who threatened with a gun. Wan Junming, Wang Zhonghong, Chen Bingsheng, Wu Xingsheng, and other four criminals were each sentenced to life imprisonment. Li Jinshan? Lu Zhangshi and other two men and women were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Chen Zhaoming, Zheng Changqing Zheng Yushi and other three men and women were declared innocent.

<h3>The Strange Female Corpse Case in the Huangpu River is Concluded. Sentencing is Scheduled.</h3>
<p>The defendant Qiao Qishi in the Zhang Jinlin case of the strange female corpse found in the Huangpu River at the Taikoo No. 2 Pier in the French Concession was prosecuted by Prosecutor Xie Lian of the local court for homicide. Judge Wu Xiangzu has been ordered to open the trial several times. Because the case is important, he has personally conducted an on-the-spot investigation. The details have been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. At 10 am yesterday, Judge Wu continued the trial. The plaintiff Zhang Zhou Shi stated that the coffin of her niece Zhang Jinlin had been buried and requested to redress the death of the deceased. Then, Qiao Qishi, who was in custody, stated that because the deceased wanted to ask Chu Fuqing for the deposit, she was introduced by her cohabitant Hu to a lawyer to pursue it. As for who killed the deceased, she did not know it and was falsely accused. Lawyer Zhou Yu and Hu Fenglian came to the court to prove the process of pursuing the deposit in the civil court. Later, the lawsuit was suspended due to the tragedy of the creditor. Chu Fuqing stated that the deceased's deposit had been submitted to the court. Finally, Qiao Liantang, Qiao Qishi's paramour, stated that he had known Qishi for six years. In June this year, he returned to his hometown in Zhenjiang due to an incident. He did not return to Shanghai until the fourth day of July. He did not know the details. At this point, Prosecutor Xie came to court to express his opinion.

It was scheduled to pronounce the sentence. Qiao Qishi and Chu Fuqing were sent back to prison together. Chu Fuqing was in custody in another case.</p>
<h3>Neurotic. Repeatedly Tried to Commit Suicide. Wang Weijun Finally Died by Hanging. His Wife's Prevention Was Ineffective.</h3>
<p>Wang Weijun, a native of Dongtai, Jiangbei, was 23 years old this year and worked as a tailor. His grandfather and father had been doing business in Yixing in their early years, so they lived in Yixing for more than 30 years. Wang married a woman from Yixing, Meng, at the age of 18. Wang has been married for five years and has not given birth. Wang has been working in Shanghai, and his wife Meng also came to Shanghai to work as a helper due to her poor family background, using her salary to subsidize her family. The couple had a very close relationship. They could not make a living in Shanghai alone, so they often visited each other. This summer, Wang thought that it was difficult to develop by making clothes for others, so he resigned from his job and rented the back building of a tobacco and paper shop opened by his cousin Wang Weigen at No. 26 Xiaobang Bay, French Concession. He personally solicited clothing work from customers and slept here at night. His wife Meng worked as a helper outside. On the 16th of last month, she stopped working and lived with Wang to form a small family. She hoped that the young couple would live a happy life. However, Wang had a neurotic love state since this spring and often had thoughts of suicide. He had previously untied his belt and tightened it around his neck to strangle himself, but his cousin found out and stopped him, so he was spared a wrongful death. At 11 pm the night before, Wang suddenly wanted to go to Hongkou to retrieve his clothes and watch, and told his wife for no reason that he would never return home after this trip. Meng was shocked when she heard this and stopped him from going out. The couple had a slight quarrel. Wang insisted on going out. Fearing that he could not stop her husband's actions alone, she locked Wang in the room and locked it from the outside. Then, she went out to find Wang's cousin and others to ask them to persuade him. Who knew that Wang finally had the thought of committing suicide again after his wife went out. He used his own foot cloth belt to tie a knot and hang himself on the horizontal railing in the room. The cloth belt was not strong enough to bear his weight and broke, causing Wang to fall to the floor. Because it was in the middle of the night, the cohabitants had already fallen asleep, so no one noticed. At 2 o'clock, Wang's wife Meng found her cousin and others and returned. She opened the door lock and went inside to check. Wang was lying on the ground and could not be moved. He had already died and could not be saved. She was shocked and cried loudly. Her cousin, the second landlord, heard the sound and asked about the situation and reported it to the French police station. The detective was sent to investigate and satirize. Then, the body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for a coroner's examination. Yesterday, a special court was reported to the court. Wang Ren, the prosecutor, the forensic secretary, and others came to the office and confirmed that the deceased Wang Weijun had died by hanging himself. After questioning the deceased's wife, the detective reported the investigation situation and presented the three sections of cloth belt and a lock to the case. The official ruled that the body should be handed over to the deceased's wife, Wang Mengshi, for collection. The three sections of cloth belt were kept in the warehouse for future reference, and the lock was seized. Whether Wang Mengshi had any acts of infringing on freedom was also investigated and handled by the police department.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Mortgage Property Case Zhang Danru Appealed Requesting Confirmation of Representative Authority Yesterday's Trial Debate Concluded</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange previously entrusted Zhang Danru to mortgage six land deeds to British expatriate Leicester for more than 1.8 million taels of silver. When the term expired and there was no money to redeem them, Morris, the estate trustee of Leicester, filed a lawsuit against Zhang Danru and the guarantor Xue Zhusun. When the First Special District Local Court opened the trial, Yu Qiaqing, the director of the exchange's legal representative, stated that Zhang Danru only had the mortgage right to represent five deeds. The act of adding 45,000 taels of silver to Deed No. 17 in the British Register was denied. Because the exchange suddenly raised this objection, Zhang separately filed a lawsuit against the exchange to confirm the power of attorney, saying that the exchange had initially entrusted him with five deeds in the 13th year of the Republic of China to mortgage to Leicester, and then repeatedly increased the mortgage amount and extended the redemption period. Finally, he could not redeem them, so he added Deed No. 17 as a mortgage and added 450,000 taels of silver. However, the act of representative mortgage this time was not included in the letter of attorney given by the exchange, which led to a dispute over the scope of the power of attorney. It was requested that the exchange should confirm that he had all the mortgage rights of attorney, etc. As a result of the first instance, Zhang's request was rejected, but Zhang was not willing to lose the lawsuit, so he hired lawyer Wu Zhengqiao to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, and explained the various facts of the appellant Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange's entrustment to him to mortgage the deeds to Leicester and Leicester's Estate Management Committee, and the origin of Deed No. 17 in the British Register, and according to the jurisprudence of Article 169 of the Civil Law, he debated in detail, requesting that the original judgment be annulled, and confirming that Zhang had the right to represent the deed. He also requested that the case be notified to Morris and others so that they could participate. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Han of the Second Branch of the High Court specially convened a collegial panel. The appellee also hired lawyer Zhang Zhengxue to attend the court on behalf of him. After the appellant made his statement, he stood up and rebutted it once. The court discussed and waited for the sentence to be pronounced on the afternoon of the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Father Refused to Let His Son Return Home. The Aunt Obstructed Him. Yi Zhuo Sued for Inheritance Rights. Yesterday's Trial Described the Family's Painful History.</h3>
<p>Tan Jingyu, a wealthy Cantonese businessman in Shanghai, accumulated more than 10 million taels of gold and gave birth to a son named Tan Zhuo. He studied literature in various European countries. After returning to China, he participated in the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army and made repeated achievements. After the success of the Northern Expedition, he retired and returned to Shanghai, intending to return home to serve his parents, but Tan Jingyu declared in the newspaper that he had broken away from his son because he had been away from home for a long time and there was no news of him. When Tan Zhuo arrived home, he was suddenly rejected by his father. Zhuo was surprised and hired lawyers Chen Zhen and Liu Shichao to file a petition with the local court for permission to adjudicate the inheritance right. After receiving the petition, the court ordered Judge Wang Run to open the trial several times without a conclusion. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case was continued at 3 pm yesterday by Judge Wang Run. The plaintiff Tan Zhuo and lawyers Chen and Liu attended the court. The defendant Tan Jingyu did not attend and was represented by lawyer Hua to attend the court and answer the defense. First, according to Tan Zhuo, he went to visit relatives a few days ago, and it was said that his father's spirit was normal and he went to a certain place with his relatives to play. The hidden truth of this case was completely incited by his aunt Huang Aihua, which led to this misfortune. Asked, what is the relationship between Huang and the breakdown of your father and son's feelings? Answer, the aunt (ie Huang Aihua) has a cohabiting relationship with my father and has already given birth to two younger brothers. This time, I am afraid of my wife's family, so she is jealous and obstructs me, etc. The defendant's lawyer said that the defendant Tan Jingyu has a mental illness and is unable to walk, so he has hired this lawyer to attend the court on his behalf and is responsible for answering all questions. The interrogating officer said that this case is a father-son lawsuit and should not go to extremes. At the next court session, the defendant must be instructed to attend the court in person so as to adopt the true intentions of both parties. The defendant's lawyer listened to the instruction and said yes, and then withdrew from the court.</p>
<h3>Liu Gensheng Was Caught Selling Illicit Salt.</h3>
<p>The sales rights of Hezhixing in the Public Concession of this city are contracted by the Gongmao Salt Bank. Now, Shen Yougen and other inspectors of the bank have found that Liu Genji Salt Store opened by Liu Gensheng at No. 1 North Fujian Road has been selling illicit salt and has a lot of illicit salt hidden at No. 215 Guangdong Road. Therefore, they reported it to the General Patrol Room and requested an investigation. Hua Detective Zhang Mingde and Detective Liu Qingsheng asked the First Special District Court for a search warrant. At this time, Liu suddenly loaded 350 kilograms of illicit salt stored at No. 215 Guangdong Road into a small car, intending to transport it to another place. He was found out by Shen Yougen and was ordered to be detained and Liu was arrested and taken to the police station. After Zhang Detective investigated, he learned that the illicit salt was transported from Ningbo. The method of smuggling was to put the salt in a hemp bag and mix it with several crabs. If the police questioned it, they would say it was for salty crabs, so it was never exposed. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case and requested that he be punished according to Article 1 of the Illicit Salt Punishment Law. Liu Gensheng argued and said that the salt was swept from the ship by ordinary peddlers and sold to me for making pickles. After the presiding judge Feng Shide verified the confession, he ordered Liu Gensheng to be sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Gan Deyun Strives for Voting Rights for Chinese Taxpayers in the Concession</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Gan Deyun, a naturalized lawyer (formerly known as Gan Weilu, of British nationality), was recently sued in the First Special District Court for refusing to pay 239.40 yuan in public concession bureau taxes for the three seasons of summer, autumn, and winter this year. After being summoned once, the lawyer representing the concession bureau requested a judgment ordering him to pay the full amount. However, Gan filed a counterclaim, explaining ten reasons for his refusal to pay. According to Gan, before he became a Chinese citizen, he received a ballot for each taxpayer's annual meeting. Now that he has lost this right, he is unwilling to fulfill his tax obligations. Chinese people account for more than 75% of the public concession's tax revenue, paying taxes every year but not receiving the rights that taxpayers should have. The concession bureau has no legal basis. He intends to argue according to reason and, if necessary, plans to request the support of Chinese taxpayers in the public concession with real power. Although this matter started with him, it is actually a vital issue for all taxpayers in the public concession.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Stipulates Domestic Telegram Word Count Charges</h3>
<p>The Two Roads Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: "Approved consultation No. 1296 of the Ministry of Communications' Telegraph Affairs Department on November 13, 24th year of the Republic of China: 'After the implementation of the General Rules for Domestic Telegram Business, in order to facilitate the checking of the number of words by the operators of each telegraph office during transmission, the Ministry has stipulated that from October 1, the "actual number of words" in the receiving location name of all kinds of domestic telegrams, regardless of the text, will be calculated as one word to simplify the process.

<h3>Dr. Zhang Fayao Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Liu Huizhi's Daughter-in-Law Elopes with a Chauffeur; Liu's Son Sues for Divorce, Unlikely to Cause Disputes, but the Terms of Both Parties Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon by Mediators</h3>
<p>Recently, a master-servant love affair occurred in Shanghai, causing a sensation. The female protagonist of the case is Xi Yunqing (Yunqing), the daughter of Xi Er'e Xian, a giant merchant of pigments, and the wife of Liu Zirong, the youngest son of Liu Huizhi, the former general manager of the China Industrial Bank. The male protagonist is Wu Wenxiang, a chauffeur from Pudong. Liu Zirong was studying at St. John's University in Western Shanghai. On January 25th, 21st year of the Republic of China, through the introduction of matchmakers Jiang Bingsheng (deceased) and Zhu Douwen, he held a wedding with Xi Yunqing at his old residence on Avenue Edouard VII. At first, the two sides had deep feelings, and both belonged to the intellectual class. Therefore, on September 21st of the following year, they had a son. Later, they moved to 48 Zhongshi New Village, 579 Lane, Yuyuan Road, and lived together. The furnishings in the room were extremely luxurious and elegant. Later, because Zirong wandered away and did not return, Yunqing was not accustomed to being alone in her empty room. Whenever the moon was bright and the wind was clear, she often sighed about the loneliness of her boudoir. The chauffeur Wu Wenxiang took the opportunity to attack, and soon it became a reality. Liu Yunqing did not hesitate to entrust her golden body to a chauffeur. This scene of a master-servant love affair sprouted at this time. However, Liu Zirong was still in the dark until 9:30 AM on August 2nd of last year, when Liu Yunqing suddenly went out and never returned. Upon checking the boxes and luggage, it was discovered that diamond bracelets and rings worth 15,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan in cash had disappeared. After an investigation, it was learned that Liu Yunqing had eloped with the chauffeur Wu Wenxiang, taking all the money with them. At that time, because it was unknown where they had fled, Liu's family reported the information to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Jing'an Temple Police Station for investigation on August 5th. At the same time, Liu Zirong conducted his own investigation. After more than a year, there was no news. Liu believed that his wife Yunqing had eloped with someone, and the relationship was obviously broken. Therefore, on November 7th of this year, he appointed lawyer Shan Yuhua to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District, requesting a divorce from Xi Yunqing (i.e., Liu Xi) based on Article 1052, Clause 2 of the Civil Code. At that time, because the defendant's address was unknown, a request was made for public announcement of service. The court approved the public announcement of service. However, after Xi Yunqing eloped with Wu Wenxiang, they hid in a pavilion of the Xiaoyou Industrial Cooperative at 84 Wu Family Lane, Qianjiatang, in the French Concession, living together like a couple. On the morning of the 27th of last month, Liu Zirong discovered their whereabouts and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. Xi Yunqing and Wu Wenxiang were arrested and detained by the Public Security Bureau, and were sent to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation a few days ago. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the First Special District Court, presided over by Judge Peng Shi, summoned the divorce case in the Fourth Civil Court. The plaintiff, Liu Zirong, did not arrive, and was represented by lawyer Yan Yuhua, who stated that the defendant in this case had been arrested as reported in the newspaper, and that it was heard today that they were being investigated at the District Court Procuratorate this afternoon. In this case, a request was made for postponement, because the two sides may have no dispute on the point of divorce, but the terms have not yet been agreed upon by mediators. Judge Peng ruled that the case would be postponed to 3:30 PM on the 17th of this month, pending the transfer of Liu Xi from the District Court Procuratorate for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau Earnestly Advises Citizens to Purchase Simple Life Insurance; The Government's Purpose in Establishing It is to Develop the National Economy; It is Hoped That the People Will Make Good Use of It to Strengthen the Foundation of the System</h3>
<p>State-run simple life insurance has been inaugurated simultaneously in Shanghai and Nanjing. Because this undertaking is exclusively operated by the state and is still in its initial stage, its benefits to the national economy and the people's livelihood are of great importance. Zhang Mingxin, director of the insurance department, believes that at the beginning of this operation, people from all walks of life have paid attention to it, but they may not have a deep understanding of the insurance application procedures and insurance benefits. Yesterday, he made a statement to the Dagong News Agency, earnestly advising citizens to actively purchase insurance. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>Supporting National Economic Losses</p>
<p>Simple life insurance has been in preparation for several years, and I am very honored to be able to participate in this undertaking, which was inaugurated the day before yesterday (the 2nd). I am especially grateful for the presence and guidance of leaders from all walks of life and their participation in purchasing insurance to promote it, as well as the enthusiastic participation of the public. Although the principles of simple life insurance and ordinary life insurance are the same, their purposes are different. Because its procedures are simple and the premiums are low, there is no need for complicated physical examinations, and the premiums can be paid monthly from only one jiao to six yuan. Therefore, any citizen can purchase insurance by paying a few jiao per month. In other words, it is also called family insurance, because anyone in a family, regardless of gender, who is between the ages of twelve and sixty can purchase insurance. The government's purpose in establishing simple life insurance is mainly to help reduce the losses to the national economy and to prevent the results of premature death from leaving dependents impoverished. However, since the government has established this system, it is especially important that the people can make good use of it. The more people who use it, the more stable the foundation of the system will be. Now that it is in its initial stage, I dare to offer it to those who are considering purchasing insurance.</p>
<p>Fill Out the Insurance Application Carefully</p>
<p>The insurance application form must be filled out accurately. Simple life insurance does not require a physical examination, but at the same time, it should also prevent those with excessively weak constitutions or chronic diseases from taking the opportunity to join, which would adversely affect the benefits that most of the insured should enjoy in the future. Therefore, the insurance application form must have clear and accurate records as a basis for deciding whether or not to underwrite. For example, the age and the history of past illnesses and current health should be filled out truthfully, without any falsehood. Those who cannot fill it out themselves may entrust the staff of the bureau to write it on their behalf, and the policyholder should sign and seal it. The staff of the bureau will keep the contents of the form confidential and will not leak it out. If the policyholder fills out the insurance application form inaccurately at the time of purchase, it will be invalidated according to regulations if it is found out in the future. Even if a death occurs, the insurance money cannot be received. Policyholders must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Premiums Must Be Paid on Time</p>
<p>Premiums should be paid monthly on time to the best of one's ability. The premium is set to be collected once a month. The policyholder can pay it at the window of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, or the bureau can send staff to collect it on time. However, to save costs, it is hoped that policyholders must pay it on time every month. If it is not paid after a two-month grace period, the contract will become invalid. If the contract becomes invalid, both the policyholder and the insurer (i.e., the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau) will suffer considerable losses. Moreover, when the policyholder is in financial difficulty, it is precisely when insurance is needed the most. Therefore, maintaining the validity of the contract to the end will surely achieve the satisfactory hope of fulfilling one's wishes.</p>
<p>Developing the Economy and Promoting Prosperity</p>
<p>Simple life insurance is established by the government to help reduce the losses to the national economy, as mentioned above. However, the implementation of this system relies heavily on the practical cooperation between the people and the government. Because the more people who join, the larger the group's strength will be and the more solid the foundation will be. Now that it is in its initial stage, it is hoped that enthusiastic people in the society will promote it widely and advise their family members and friends to join as soon as possible, so that they can all get reliable economic security. At the same time, the more popular the idea of insurance becomes, the smoother the progress of ordinary life insurance undertakings will be, which will be of great benefit to developing the national economy and promoting social prosperity. Anyone who wants to purchase insurance can notify the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau by telephone so that staff can be sent to contact them at any time.</p>
<h3>The Human-Powered Cart Association of the Special District Petitioned the Vehicle Committee Yesterday Morning, Objecting to the Arbitrary Deduction of Vehicle Licenses and Punishments, Resulting in a Satisfactory Outcome</h3>
<p>The Human-Powered Cart Association of the Special District petitioned the Vehicle Committee yesterday morning at 10:00 AM due to the Vehicle Committee's arbitrary deduction of vehicle licenses and arbitrary punishments, based on a resolution of the general meeting. The representatives included Hou Shao'an, Yin Zhiling, Jin Chunlin, Liu Zhenqiu, and Lu Danshu.

This is hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Pei Hongguang Returns Home After Completing His Studies</h3>
<p>Pei Hongguang is from Nanyang County, Henan Province. He graduated from the science department of the Sino-French University of Peiping in the 18th year of the Republic of China. He was then sent to France by the school to study at the University of Lyon, majoring in chemistry. After obtaining a higher diploma in chemistry, Pei decided to study the paper industry, regarding it as a practical application of chemistry. Moreover, since all kinds of paper materials used in our country rely on imports, he decided to study this industry. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, he entered the Grenoble Higher Specialized Paper School and graduated this summer with a degree in paper engineering. He then interned in major paper mills in France and gained considerable experience. Mr. Pei arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship "Asie" yesterday.</p>
<p>At a time when the paper industry in our country is just beginning, there is a need for such talents. It is hoped that Mr. Pei will be able to use what he has learned to serve society.</p>
<h3>The French Municipal Council is Considering Banning Dance Halls; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Forwarded a Letter of Reply to the Municipal Federation of Associations</h3>
<p>The Civil Association of the First Special District of this city previously sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting it to forward a request to the Concession authorities to ban dance halls. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied, stating: "In response to your letter, which stated that the dance halls in the Special District of this city have developed abnormally and should be forwarded for banning, etc., we immediately forwarded a letter to the authorities of the two concessions requesting strict banning, and we have received replies from the Public Concession Bureau for forwarding and reply on file. Now, we have received a reply from the French Municipal Council stating: 'We have received and read your letter of November 13th, stating that the dance halls in this city have developed abnormally in this time of commercial decline, and requesting strict banning in order to save morals, etc. This matter is currently under investigation by this bureau, and we will reply to your association after careful consideration.' Accordingly, we hereby send another letter in reply for your information."</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Schedule Memorial Service for Ge Gongzhen</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Ge Gongzhen, a giant in China's journalism circles, passed away due to illness after returning from an inspection tour in Europe. Various circles expressed their condolences. The Shanghai Journalists Association, Shen Bao Newspaper, Xinwen Bao Newspaper, Shibao Newspaper, Shishi Xinbao Newspaper, Chen Bao Newspaper, Min Bao Newspaper, Zhonghua Daily Newspaper, Dalu Bao Newspaper, Central Daily Newspaper, Xinjing Daily Newspaper, Chaobao Newspaper, Fudan University, Great China University, Central News Agency, Guowen News Agency, Xinsheng News Agency, Huadong News Agency, Chinese Journalism Society, Mingxing Film Company, Chinese Students' World Association, Youzheng Bookstore, Life Bookstore, Dongtai Association of Shanghai Fellow Provincials, etc., have jointly initiated a memorial service and public burial to be held on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Fire in a Wood Shop in Shenjia Alley, Pudong</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, a fire broke out in the wood shop opened by Jiang Atu, a local, next to the Yikang Society pasture in Jiangjia Bridge, Shenjia Alley, Pudong. It is unknown how, but a fire suddenly broke out in the highest pile of reed firewood, and the flames soared in an instant and were uncontrollable. The Yangjiadu Police Station and the nearby Yangjing District Security Corps headquarters telegraphed various fire departments for assistance. Soon, Zhao Longsheng of the Pudong District Fire Brigade, Shen Yu of the Yangjing District Fire Brigade, and the Laobaidu Fire Brigade arrived at the scene with fire engines and worked together to put out the fire. However, at this time, the fire had spread to six piles of firewood and was burning fiercely, making it impossible to extinguish it for a while. Firefighters surrounded the fire from all sides and poured countless amounts of water. The fire gradually subsided at around 9:00 PM, and the buildings of the nearby Yikang Pasture and other buildings were preserved. The firefighters continued to pour water throughout the night to prevent rekindling. In total, about five or six hundred jin of reed firewood was destroyed, worth about five or six hundred yuan. After the incident, the head of the police station, Director Yang, ordered the arrest of Jiang Afa, the owner of the fire, for interrogation and investigation. It is noted that last month, the wood shop opened by Jiang Afa at the east end of the Xiaoyangjing Temple and the wood shop opened by Pan Asan in Shenjiaheng North were burned down one after another, causing heavy losses. Unexpectedly, half a month later, Jiang Atu's wood shop suffered another fire, and Jiang Atu is the younger brother of Jiang Afa. The brothers suffered the same fire disaster, which can be said to be a rare coincidence.</p>
<h3>Fire in Russian's Home, Sparks Fly onto Gaisiling</h3>
<p>Ai Enmeili Ke (transliteration), a Russian who now works at the Westerners' Youth Association in this port, lives in a Western-style house at 16 Henry Road in the French Concession with his family and employs a nanny, Xu Ma. At 9:30 AM yesterday (the 3rd), the nanny was washing clothes in the bathroom. Because the clothes were stained with oil, she used Gaisiling to remove the oil stains. Unexpectedly, there was a stove burning in the bathroom, and sparks flew into the Gaisiling bottle, causing a raging fire that was unbearable. The nanny quickly tried to put out the fire with her hands, which caused her sleeves to catch fire and her right arm to be burned. The fire in the bathroom was still raging, and she immediately reported it to the fire department by telephone. The fire truck arrived at the scene, and firefighters managed to put out the fire, fortunately without penetrating the roof. The injured nanny was bandaged on the spot with Western medicine by firefighters, and the injury was light, and she was not taken to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Police Arrest Gambling Stall; Bai Baolin Arrested and Taken to the General Bureau</h3>
<p>Bai Baolin, 54 years old, from Shandong, specializes in forming gangs to set up gambling stalls on the side of Xinkaihe Road to lure people into gambling on flower leaves and take the opportunity to rob passers-by of their property. On the 11th of last month, he and his accomplice Chen Chuanji robbed a passer-by, Zhu Chengliang, of ten yuan in banknotes, and was caught on the spot and transferred to the General Bureau for handling. He has already served his term and been released. Unexpectedly, Bai Baolin disregards the law and has not reformed. At 9:30 AM yesterday, he gathered a gang including Hu Baosheng to set up a gambling stall at Xin Xiaodongmen to lure people into gambling. He was discovered by patrolling police officer Yao Guorong, and they fled in a panic. Only Bai Baolin was arrested and taken to the station for investigation. Director Liu interrogated and found that the defendant made a living by luring people into gambling and robbing them. He had been punished before, but he still did not repent and dared to form gangs again. He was truly despicable and ordered that he be handed over to the General Bureau for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Buyer for Beile Company Surrenders to the Concession Police Because He Was Investigated for Leaving His Position with Funds; He Returned to Shanghai and Surrendered After Learning About It</h3>
<p>Yin Fugen, a buyer for the British Beile Company and a native of Ningbo, has repeatedly used fraudulent means to defraud the company of 18,166.85 yuan in recent months. He suddenly resigned and returned to his hometown quietly half a month ago. The company reported to the police and requested an investigation. Yin returned to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago and surrendered to the Hongkou Police Station at 5:00 AM yesterday after learning about the matter. He was then sent to the First Special District Court by Judge Jiang Shuzi for interrogation. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, briefly stated the facts of the case and requested that Yin be temporarily detained pending investigation. Yin hired a lawyer to defend him, stating that Yin, as a buyer, had provided 20,000 yuan to the plaintiff company as a guarantee, and that he had to extract a 3% commission for all transactions. Therefore, it should be verified whether the funds were indeed embezzled, and this case was purely a civil matter with no need for detention. He requested that he be allowed to post bail. Judge Jiang then ordered him to provide a written guarantee of 19,000 yuan pending a decision.</p>
<h3>Convict Wang Jiandong and Others Sentenced</h3>
<p>Wang Jiandong, a human trafficker from Wenzhou, and a woman, Wang Wu (formerly from Hangzhou and Huzhou), claiming to be husband and wife, rented a room in the back building of the home of a local, Yao Shuncai, at 2 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, in the French Concession on the morning of the 11th of last month. The rent was agreed upon at five yuan per month, to be used as a residence, planning to use it as a place to hide abducted children. After renting the room, they rented wooden furniture and moved in that afternoon, bringing a four- or five-year-old boy, claiming that he was their son. On the third day, they abducted Luo Xiaomao, the five-year-old son of Luo Jinru, the owner of the Lichang Machine Factory at 83 Xujiahui Road, hiding him in their home, planning to take him out for sale. That night, Xiaomao was in a strange house and did not see his parents or acquaintances, so he cried incessantly. Because Luo Jinru had lived in the front building of Yao Shuncai's house, the second landlord, Yao Shuncai, heard the child crying and suspected that it was the voice of Luo Xiaomao, a familiar child, so he paid attention. The next morning, he went upstairs to see the child who had been crying the night before and found that it was indeed Luo Xiaomao, and he knew that he had been abducted. He secretly monitored the actions of the human traffickers and informed the child's parents. Luo had been frantically searching for the child since he went missing. The couple were overjoyed when they received Yao's notification and reported it to the French police station. Inspector Jin Jiulin and investigator Zhang Ziying arrested the human traffickers Wang Jiandong and Wang Wu, and rescued the child, returning him to Luo. Wang and others were taken to the police station with the child they had brought, and they also arrested accomplices Lu Weng, Li Wenqing, and Cai Yucheng, totaling five men and women, and sent them to the Second Special Court for investigation and detention. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. During the investigation, the police found that the child Wang and Wu had brought, claiming to be their son, had also been abducted. The child was the son of Liu Huanwen, a native of Wuxi, who lived on Avenue Haig. His name was Baogen, and he was four years old. He was abducted while playing in front of the door at 11:00 AM on the 9th of the same month. The family was notified, and the child was returned to them. The police department then filed a public prosecution against Wang and others on charges of disrupting the family and enticing an underage boy to leave his family, in accordance with the Criminal Law. After the Second Special Court Judge Xiong concluded the interrogation, he announced the judgment on the previous day: Wang Jiandong was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, Wang Wu was sentenced to six years of imprisonment, Li Wenqing was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, Cai Yucheng was sentenced to four years of imprisonment, and Lu Weng was sentenced to three years of imprisonment as a warning. During the appeal period, the defendants were transferred to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Orders Silk and Satin Industry to Forbid Further Use of Old System Weights and Measures; Guild Relays to Members to Collect and Send Old Instruments for Destruction</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, based on reports that silk and satin businesses in the city are still using the old system of weights and measures, has specially ordered the Silk and Satin Trade Association to instruct its members to collect all old instruments and send them to the Bureau of Weights and Measures for destruction, in order to standardize. Yesterday, the Guild specially issued a notice to all members, the original letter stating: "Case received from the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's Order No. 12066: Now, according to citizens' reports, silk and satin businesses in this city are still using weights and measures from the old system. Please take measures to prohibit this." After investigation, it has been found that the city announced the standardization of weights and measures years ago. All businesses in the industry should comply in order to achieve uniformity. Based on the aforementioned report, it is hereby ordered that the association comply and instruct all businesses not to continue using weights and measures from the old system. Immediately investigate and collect all old system instruments and send them to the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures for destruction without delay. This order..."</p>
<p>Upon receiving this order, we investigated and found that the government has repeatedly emphasized the new standardized system of measurement. Our association has also issued notices in the past instructing everyone to comply. Now, upon receiving the aforementioned order, it has been reported that some businesses are still using old instruments, which shows a lack of understanding of government regulations and undermines measurement policies. Fortunately, the Social Bureau is considerate and has ordered that all old instruments be collected and sent for destruction, without immediately imposing penalties, showing great leniency. However, after this notice is issued by our association, if any businesses do not hand in their old instruments or continue to act in defiance, once discovered by the relevant authorities or reported, leading to penalties, they will be solely responsible. Our association cannot provide any guarantees. Do not say you were not warned. In addition to publishing this in the newspaper and issuing a notice, we are hereby issuing another order to be delivered. Please investigate and ensure that all old system rulers and scales, whether belonging to members or non-members, are submitted to the association within three days of receiving this letter, so that they can be collected and sent to the Bureau of Weights and Measures for destruction. Please do not treat this as a mere formality, lest you bring trouble upon yourselves. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<p>I have just read the Shanghai news in today's newspaper about the resolution on the interbank loan rate at the general meeting of the Money Trade Association, in which the November interbank loan rate was set at four yuan with a 95% discount. This news differs from the figures in our association's resolution. After investigation, the November deposit rate discussed on that day was 4.50 yuan with a 95% discount. It is likely that the reporter made a writing error and omitted the words "fifty cents". However, this matter concerns the city's deposit rate and may cause disputes. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Money Trade Association, December 3, 1935.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Yesterday, your newspaper reported news about Song Pin of Haimen being accused, and there was a mention of Gao Xingbao. However, I am not acquainted with Song Pin, and I know nothing about Song's affairs. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Gao Xingbao, February 3.</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Cotton Fabric Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(Part 4 of an Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>1.  History</p>
<p>China has a vast territory and a large population. The consumption of cotton fabric is almost equal to that of food. Therefore, since ancient times, "men plow and women weave," division of labor and cooperation, and only then can we have no worries about food and clothing. During the Qing Dynasty, household hand-woven cloth was extremely developed in various places. The local cloth of Jiangsu was especially famous far and wide. In addition to self-sufficiency, it was also sold to European, American, and Japanese countries. However, with the rise of machine-woven cotton fabric in various countries, the sales of our local cloth overseas were not only sharply reduced, but machine-woven cotton fabric from Europe and the United States was also sold in our country. Old-fashioned handmade local cloth was gradually eliminated. After the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, Shanghai's commerce flourished, and cotton fabric from various countries gathered and dispersed here. The earliest operators of this industry were Tongchang on Beijing Road (established in the first year of Xianfeng), Tongchunxiang on Nanjing Road, Rixin Sheng on Gongguan Road (all established in the eighth year of Tongzhi), Yuantai Jinji at Sanbianjing Bridge (first year of Guangxu), Chen Rongxing at Lao Zha Bridge (ninth year of Guangxu), Yonghexing on Zhaojia Road (twenty-fourth year of Guangxu), and Rixin Zeng on Gongguan Road (second year of Xuantong). They were all long-standing and well-capitalized. Later, cotton fabric shops sprang up like mushrooms. Everyone wanted to earn some profits and commissions between the differences in buying and selling prices. However, insightful people knew that specializing in selling foreign cloth was not a good long-term strategy. In order to prevent leakage, the Shanghai Foreign Cloth Bureau was established in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, which was the beginning of our country's machine-woven cloth factory. After that, machine-made cloth factories were established in various places, and they were determined to operate diligently and spare no effort. However, due to poor equipment and backward technology, the cloth they wove, regardless of quality or color, was difficult to compete with foreign goods. Therefore, the annual import of foreign cloth did not decrease slightly, but always ranked first among imported goods. As a result, the Shanghai cotton fabric market was monopolized by foreign goods for a long time. However, the ebb and flow of their power are quite different now and in the past. Roughly, American goods were the most dominant in the early days. In less than ten years, British goods rose and replaced them. After management and operation, their power increased day by day. From the first year of the Republic of China to the fifth year of the Republic of China, business was the most developed, which was the golden age of Western goods. When the European War broke out, Britain had no time to look east, and British goods were squeezed out by Japanese goods. From the sixth year of the Republic of China to the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, it was the golden age of Japanese goods. Later, due to the "May 30th" tragedy, the Chinese people rose up to boycott goods, and Japanese goods were severely hit. Domestic cloth factories took the opportunity to rise, so from the 16th to the 25th year of the Republic of China, it was the golden age of domestic goods. Although the gray cloth still mostly relied on the eastern neighbor, there was an unavoidable suspicion of "changing the face." However, due to limitations of capital and technology, it was also helpless. When the "September 18th" Shenyang Incident arose, the old story of boycotting goods was re-mentioned, and domestic cotton fabric made another step forward. The quality became more and more refined, and it began to occupy a considerable position in the Shanghai market. All imported coarse cloth, fine cloth, standard cloth, and coarse and fine twill, etc., were replaced by domestic goods. Only velveteen, foreign yarn, rogge, poplin, and fancy cloth, etc., have not yet been refined by the Chinese. At the same time, the Shanghai Cotton Fabric Industry Association's member shops have already focused on domestic cloth as their main business, and the number of foreign goods imported has also decreased day by day, which cannot be said to be unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>2.  Types of Cotton Fabric</p>
<p>The types of cotton fabric sold in Shanghai are very numerous, as many as hundreds of types, and there is a trend of increasing day by day. However, if it is classified by the region of origin, it can be roughly divided into three types: Western goods, Japanese goods, and domestic goods. Western goods include products from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Russia, the Netherlands, and other countries. Japanese goods are purely made in Japan. As for domestic goods, they include products from domestic and foreign factories and Chinese factories. Among the three, Western goods are the most refined in quality, but the cost is not as low as Japanese goods and domestic goods, which is the reason why Western goods have declined in the past ten years. In terms of the color of cotton fabric, it can be divided into two types: white goods and fancy goods. White goods are further divided into plain cloth, coarse cloth, fine cloth, coarse twill cloth, fine twill cloth, and standard cloth, which can be manufactured by domestic cotton weaving factories. Fancy goods are all dyed cloth, which are called fancy goods. There are many types, and most of them are imported, except for a few domestic dyeing and weaving factories that can dye and weave them. The most popular imported fancy goods in Shanghai are eighteen types: (1) printed cloth, (2) dyed foreign standard cloth, (3) Western satin, (4) foreign red cloth, (5) velvet, (6) cotton flannel, (7) cotton feather silk, (8) foreign yarn, (9) crepe, (10) poplin, (11) cotton feather silk, (12) willow cloth, (13) plain willow cloth, (14) colored cloth, (15) cotton sheared velvet, (16) xiffa velvet, (17) crepe yarn, (18) cotton feather twill. In terms of the business division of cotton fabric, there are cotton fabric industry, factory cloth industry, and local cloth industry. The boundaries of the business are clear. Each has its own guild organization. According to Shanghai custom, those who operate cotton fabric can also operate factory cloth and local cloth. Those who operate factory cloth and local cloth cannot also operate cotton fabric. Therefore, this article only covers the cotton fabric industry. The investigation of the factory cloth and local cloth industries will be discussed in the future.</p>
<p>3.  Weaving Process</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Foreign Cloth Bureau used machines to weave cloth, the production method of cotton fabric in our country has changed greatly. From wooden machines to iron machines, from foot-operated machines to electric machines, with the rapid development of machinery, the improvement of products is also very fast. The weaving process can be divided into three parts: The first part is the preparation project. A. Winding warp. The method is to wind the yarn into a bobbin so that it will not become loose or break during weaving. B. Organizing, place the yarn bobbins on the organizing rack, then guide the yarn, pass through the back buckle, and collect it into a suitable width. C. Sizing, make the yarn feel extremely uniform paste, so that it can be firm and straight. D. Drawing in, that is, threading the sized yarn into the heddle eye. E. Reed the yarn, thread the yarn head that has passed through the heddle eye into the reed tooth. F. Winding weft, wind the weft yarn onto the yarn bobbin. With the warp and weft ready, the second part of the weaving project begins. A. Shedding, that is, separate the warp yarn into two pieces, creating a shed so that the weft-carrying shuttle can pass through it. B. Picking, after the shedding, the shuttle must be passed from one side of the machine through the shed to the other side of the machine, so that it can release a weft, intersecting between the warp yarns. C. Beating-up, after the shuttle weaves in a weft yarn, it must be buckled tightly inward so that it is closely connected with the front and back, and then it can be woven into a cloth. Delivery and take-up, with the progress of weaving, send out the weft yarn of appropriate length from the warp beam and maintain the appropriate tightness. This is called delivery. After the weaving is completed, it must be gradually rolled on a wooden stick at an appropriate speed. This is called take-up. In addition, when the weft yarn of a shuttle is used up or cut off, the machine will stop automatically and must be manually connected. If it is installed as an automatic machine, it can be connected by itself without stopping the machine. If it is a fine product, a sprayer is placed on the upper end of several weaving machines so that the cloth body is not brittle due to tightness. After the weaving is completed, the third part of the finishing project is carried out. A. Sewing cloth. Sew the cloths woven by each machine together continuously to facilitate dyeing. B. Singeing, burn off the fuzz on both sides of the cloth with two purple copper sheets to show the pattern. The undesirable chemicals in the paste can also be found. C. Washing, use water to wash away the dirt on the remaining cloth after the fabric has been singed. C. Dehydration, put the cloth into a dehydration machine to roll off the water, and then put it on a drying machine to dry it. E. Stretching, the fabric is easy to wrinkle, so use a stretching machine to widen the width. F. Flattening, that is, calendaring with a calendaring machine or electric light with an electric light machine. The weaving work is finished at this time. If it needs to be bleached, it will be steamed and washed in the bleaching room. After bleaching, it can be dyed or printed, and nothing is impossible. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup International Handball: China Hopes for Championship; Currently Leading 7-3, Just Needs to Win One More Doubles Match Today</h3>
<p>The Public Exhibition Cup International Handball continued yesterday with the second round of the cup's singles matches. Of the five matches, except for the fourth singles match in which He Shuoqing lost to Andrew, the remaining four matches were won by China. Currently, China has won 7-3. Today, they just need to win one more doubles match, and the championship will be secure. The five doubles matches have not been scheduled yet and must be drawn temporarily today. Therefore, all the members of the Chinese team must still attend in order to draw lots.</p>
<p>Hua Fenggang Fights Bravely</p>
<p>Hua Suigang, the second singles player, faced Kleiman first. Suigang's ball skills are very good, and he is also extremely powerful. He would rather have a bloody head than lose a ball. Yesterday's victory was based on this, so he was able to win 21-17, 21-15. Moreover, he can use both his left and right hands, which is very similar to the handball king Zhu Kuan. He is a promising talent.</p>
<p>Andrew is Very Strong</p>
<p>He Shuoqing is a newly famous player with good hitting skills, but he lacks experience. He often becomes flustered when he encounters a strong opponent. Andrew of the Western team is very strong, so Shuoqing lost 0-2. The score in the first game was too far apart. He started to show up in the second game, but he couldn't last. Victory went to Andrew.</p>
<p>Cai Tongshou is as Good as Ever</p>
<p>Cai Tongshou of the Chinese team is a good player in the handball world. He has ideas, muscle strength, and can dive, defend, and attack well. Although he has not been seen for a long time, yesterday's battle was as good as ever. An Xu Nanke was far from his opponent and was controlled by him everywhere. The victory was effortless.</p>
<p>Gaston is at a Loss</p>
<p>Huang Kesu is young and strong, and his hitting skills are clever and skillful. He is good at attacking the opponent's gaps, so he often wins. Gaston was forced by his quasi-force and was at a loss. Although he tried his best to cope, he could not recover. He lost 0-2 to Huang Kesu.</p>
<p>Yan Zhaorong Wins Very Easily</p>
<p>The tenth singles player, Yan Zhaorong, played against Ge Linna. Yan is extraordinarily brave and good at diving to save the ball. His right-hand pressure ball is especially unique, so he has more than enough to deal with Ge Linna, and he is vulnerable. He won 2-0 very easily. The scores of each game are recorded below:</p>
<p>Second Singles Hua Fenggang 21-17 21-15 Kleiman</p>
<p>Fourth Singles Andrew 21-14 21-15 He Shuoqing</p>
<p>Sixth Singles Cai Tongshou 21-19 21-14 An Xu Nanke</p>
<p>Eighth Singles Huang Kesu 21-19 21-11 Gaston</p>
<p>Tenth Singles Yan Zhaorong 21-18 21-19 Ge Linna</p>
<h3>Tonight's West Youth Basketball: John vs. Pirates</h3>

<p>Tung Wah defeated Shanghai University 61-47. Hsieh Hsing defeated Nan Hsing 60-25. Tonight, the West Youth basketball highlights a Group A match between John and Pirates. John has been undefeated in recent friendly matches, boasting exceptional strength. Pirates are the reigning champions for several years. Whether Chinese teams can rise to prominence this year heavily depends on tonight's game. Yesterday's two Group A matches were one-sided, with Tung Wah and Hsieh Hsing winning. Both teams are rich in talent and possess impressive skills. The results of yesterday and the schedule for tonight are as follows:</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule</p>
<p>7:00 PM: Jewish vs. Kuokuang, Group B</p>
<p>7:01 PM: John vs. Muir, Group B</p>

<p>Tung Wah defeated Shanghai University (Group A) 61-47</p>
<p>Hsieh Hsing defeated Nan Hsing (Group A) 60-25</p>
<p>Tung Wah Defeated Shanghai University</p>
<p>In the second Group A match, Tung Wah, composed of veterans and old players, played against the Shanghai University team which had been completely replaced with new players. The disparity in strength was expected. However, Shanghai University fought hard and persevered. After a score of 12-4, Shanghai University scored three consecutive baskets, gaining momentum. Under the opponent's defensive lapses, Tung Wah advanced smoothly, as if in an uninhabited territory, passing and shooting at will. In an instant, the score became 38-12. By the end of the first half, Tung Wah was leading comfortably with 40-18. After the break, Tung Wah's personnel adjustments caused instability. Shanghai University launched a rapid chase with great momentum. Huang Li-fu's skills were flexible, and his aim was accurate, scoring repeatedly. The score quickly rose, reaching 45-57, only twelve points behind. In the end, Tung Wah won with a score of 61-47.</p>

<p>Hsieh Hsing Defeated Nan Hsing</p>
<p>The Hsieh Hsing team is organized by the Hsieh Hsing Sporting Goods Factory. Many of the players are from Fudan University, and they once dominated the Kiangsu University Championships. With the departure of Chen Tsung-chi and the addition of Hsu Hsiang, their strength is considerable. Unfortunately, the formation is scattered, likely due to a lack of practice. Nan Hsing is a veteran participant in the West Youth Games, having painstakingly worked for years. Their skills are commendable. Except for Liu Ching-feng, a large player, the rest of the team are short and weak. Compared to Hsieh Hsing, with players over six feet tall, there was a significant disadvantage. In the first half, the score was 36-11, with Nan Hsing suffering a major setback. They tried to counterattack, and the second half was exceptionally tense. Hsieh Hsing repeatedly made substitutions, making the game even more chaotic. In the end, Hsieh Hsing won by a large margin with a score of 60-25.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Round of the Chinese Sports Federation Women's Basketball: Tsung Teh Defeats Patriotic Girls' High School, Result 19 to 9; Today, Kuang Hua vs. Chi Hsiu</h3>
<p>The annual women's basketball league organized by the Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation held its preliminary round yesterday, with Tsung Teh facing Patriotic. Tsung Teh's strength was evenly distributed, their passing was quick, and their teamwork was especially skillful. Therefore, they defeated Patriotic with a score of 19-9. There is also a match between Kuang Hua and Chi Hsiu, which has now been changed to Yaohang today. The details of yesterday's match are recorded below.</p>
<p>First Half: Tsung Teh Gains Momentum. At 3:00 PM, referee Hu Tsung-fan blew the silver whistle, and both sides lined up for battle. Tsung Teh adapted to the conditions, taking a light approach. Forward Li Yun-chih was agile and moved swiftly across the court. Defender Chen Yue-e was stout and strong, and center Yang Shao-chi was tall and strong, excelling at interception. Therefore, not long after the start of the game, Li Yun-chih scored four points in one go. Lin Kuan-yao added to the score, also scoring one. The Patriotic ladies tried to rally, but they were outmatched. They only managed to score two points through a free throw by He Miao-ying. At the end of the first half, Tsung Teh had a big win with a score of 8-2.</p>
<p>Second Half: Patriotic Counterattacks. At the start of the second half, the Patriotic players received instructions from coach Shen Kun-nan and launched a strong counterattack. However, the forwards lacked coordination, and their shooting was inaccurate. The defenders exposed weaknesses, allowing Tsung Teh to seize the opportunity to attack and accumulate points. Their long and short passes left the Patriotic ladies with only the effort of defense but no ability to counterattack. In the end, they suffered another defeat with a score of 7-11. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:</p>

<h3>Youyou Lost to Bird Assembly in a Basketball Game: 60 to 30. Youyou's Big Cat Did Not Play Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Youyou Sports Association basketball team arranged a friendly match with the Bird Assembly team, composed of teachers and students from Great China University, yesterday at 7:30 PM in the association's basketball room. Youyou has famous players such as Chen Xue-chong and Wang Cai-gao, while the Bird Assembly team also has former Beijing Normal University stars Zhang Chun-hui and Huang He-cheng, so the two sides are evenly matched. However, Youyou, as a defeated army, met this strong enemy, and fought with brilliance and fatigue, without any improvement. In addition, the main player Sun Hui-pei and others did not play, resulting in a weaker combat power. As a result, Bird Assembly won 60 to 30.</p>

<h3>The Siamese Ministry of Education Recalls the Licenses of Overseas Chinese Schools: Only Two Hours of Chinese Instruction Permitted per Week</h3>
<p>Since Siam implemented the so-called compulsory education last year, overseas Chinese schools have been required to teach Siamese, and Chinese has been allowed to be taught for only seven hours per week. After the implementation of this regulation, it once aroused opposition from the overseas Chinese community, but it was ultimately ineffective. Recently, the Siamese Ministry of Education has taken a further step by recalling all the licenses of overseas Chinese schools, which must be re-established in accordance with the newly compiled compulsory education curriculum, which stipulates that the time for teaching Chinese is only two hours, and all of them are scheduled after 3:00 PM, when the weather is hottest and students are the least energetic. However, Western schools established by Westerners and Muslim schools established by Muslims are not changed at all and can still teach Western languages and Muslim languages as usual.</p>
<h3>Public Education Should Immediately Focus on Activities: The Jiangsu Education Department Orders Social Education Agencies to Comply</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the guidance zone system in Jiangsu Province's public education, the promotion effect has been better than in the past. Now, the Jiangsu Education Department believes that the work of the staff of the public education centers in various places focuses too much on form, and the effect is very small. Therefore, it has ordered the public education centers in various counties and the provincial public education center to engage more in the dynamic aspect of the work policy in the future, so that the general public can receive practical benefits.</p>
<h3>Cooperation College Attached to the Central Political School Begins Enrollment</h3>
<p>The Cooperation College attached to the Central Political School has been prepared and is now beginning to accept enrollment applications. It is reported that the quota is tentatively set at 50 students, and female students are not recruited. Registration will begin on January 9, 1936, and physical examinations, oral examinations, and written examinations will begin on the 13th. Therefore, those who have been writing to the school for prospectuses in recent days are very enthusiastic.</p>

The second term was extended to three months, starting on September 5th, and has now been completed and ended after examinations.

<p>Nancy looked up and suddenly saw that the sun had already set, and shouted, "Oh dear, it's getting late. We must lead them away immediately, or they'll run away."</p>
<p>"I heard a horn sound about an hour ago; maybe they were blowing it for us," said Robert, whose guide was climbing a steep hill, and he was following wearily behind.</p>
<p>"On that side," he pointed with a dirty finger, but it was completely the wrong direction.</p>
<p>"Let's go that way to meet them," said Nancy, turning around, and their little feet began to run through the bushes, feeling a little scared, because there were so many paths here that she couldn't remember the route she had taken.</p>
<p>So they walked on, crossing fields and meadows, sometimes stopping to listen for the sound of the horn, but always in vain, because all they heard was the long call of the cows returning home for the night.</p>
<p>Nancy came to a low wall and sat down to look around, asking, "I don't remember seeing that pile of stones—have you?"</p>
<p>"I don't remember anything, I just want to go home," said Robert, his voice trembling slightly. Hearing this, Nancy put her arm around him, lifted him over the wall, and gently put him down on the ground, putting on her most capable tone, saying:</p>
<p>"I'm really walking very fast, dear, don't cry, when we get to the main road, I'll carry you."</p>
<p>"Where's the main road?" said Robert, wiping his eyes to see where it was.</p>
<p>"Next to that big tree. Don't you see it's the one that Neda climbed up and fell down from?"</p>
<p>"That's right. Maybe they're still waiting for us; I'd like to go home in the carriage—wouldn't you?" Robert marched towards the end of the prairie, his face beaming with pride.</p>
<p>"No, I'd rather walk," replied Nancy, feeling that she had to walk, so it was better to prepare herself wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>点滴</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>— (Zui Qiao)</p>
<p>Halfway through my journey, it suddenly started raining, so there was pouring rain above and muddy roads below, which immediately stopped me in my tracks. Constrained by financial difficulties, the rickshaw pullers also raised their prices so high, looking down on me with contemptuous smiles. Subjected to this heavy pressure, I finally mustered my courage and thought, what does it matter if my clothes and shoes get wet? I walked forward in the pouring rain and on the slippery road, and eventually reached my destination!</p>
<p>From this, I thought: This small incident today has given me a great realization. All young people who are facing the pressures of a difficult world and cold human relationships and are hesitating at the crossroads should know that to solve the problem of livelihood and seek help from the doors of the wealthy will only result in them raising their prices and looking down on you, giving you at most a sneer!</p>
<p>After being ridiculed, we should be even more motivated to strive forward, holding the spirit of sacrifice of burning our boats! Fight forward. Although it's like our clothes and shoes being invaded and soiled by wind, rain, and mud, the destination will eventually be reached, so a gentleman values relying on himself.</p>
<h3>小神仙</h3>
<p>— 采黃</p>
<p>— Cai Huang</p>
<p>"Little Immortal" is actually a child who has fallen on hard times on the streets. Asking his age, he is no more than twelve years old. Alas! Look at his small stature, like a schoolboy, yet he is already able to "earn his own living"!</p>
<p>Every day, he carries a small tin box in his hand, soliciting small business in various teahouses. The words "Little Immortal" are written on his box, and inside the box are many neatly arranged paper rolls. He says to people, "Do you want to have your characters analyzed?" He is very gentle and has a charming smile, which makes people not dislike him. A few nights ago, at the Pagoda Shade, a certain gentleman saw him and took out eight copper coins, picked two characters, and tried his skill to see if there was any truth to it. The first character he picked was "佳" (jia), and the second was "一" (yi). "Little Immortal" took them and looked at them carefully. He nodded his head and said, "What does the gentleman want to ask about?" The gentleman said, "I want to ask about this marriage. How is it going now?" "Little Immortal" replied, "At this time, it is like waiting for the missing mandarin ducks. In a few days, a perfect marriage will be completed." After speaking, he wrote a poem on a stone tablet: Needing to light the red makeup torch, Her shape is slender, her shadow is slender, Her soul is truly promised to her lover, Love tonight, fear tonight. Ten rows of tassels protect the jade hairpin, Pushing shyly, complying shyly, Tomorrow's spring will shine through her eyebrows, The lover is too lazy to paint, the lady is too lazy to paint.</p>
<p>After writing, "Little Immortal" said to the gentleman, "The matter you are asking about will be on the Double Tenth Festival. He will hold a stone pen and add a "佳" (jia) next to the "佳" (jia) character, and below that add another "又" (you) character. In the middle of the "一" (yi) character, draw a vertical line to form the "十" (shi) character, saying: These two characters match the beginning of this poem, so: Their reunion day must be on the Double Tenth Festival." At first, the gentleman did not quite believe it, thinking, "This child is pitiful. I am testing him because he is clever. If you really think he is an immortal, alas! Isn't that too superstitious?" Who knew that when the gentleman returned home, he saw that his relatives had an invitation card already on the table, and the auspicious day was indeed on the Double Tenth Festival. So everyone thought it was strange, and "Little Immortal" has not been seen recently. It is said that he left Jiading and went to another pier.</p>
<h3>綠毛龜</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Two years ago, the family of Lu Lantian in Chao'an Township, northwest of our county, kept a "white turtle" that had lived for three generations. It was regarded as a spiritual object for making wealth and was kept secret. One day, it suddenly disappeared. The family knew it was not a good omen, and Lu was indeed heard to have been kidnapped. When the case was solved, the object reappeared as before, which was said to be a miracle. I also saw in the newspaper that someone in Longhua Township had obtained a "red turtle" that was only about two inches long and completely different from ordinary turtles. Its carapace was bright red and shiny, and the Taiji diagram appeared on the front of its spine. It had five tails, was very intelligent, and crawled very quickly. However, I have not seen either the "red" or the "white" turtle, but only heard about them. Yesterday, in front of a teahouse in a certain city, I saw a man carrying a load selling goldfish. In the glass tank, there was a "green turtle." At first glance, it looked like jade, floating in the water, which was quite a sight to behold. However, there was hair attached to the shell, which was very long. When asked about it, he said, "This is not the original color of the turtle, but the color of the hair." It was no more than five inches long, but it was fluffy, and it seemed too big for a basin. The price was extremely high, and he would not sell it for less than five or six yuan, which was also said to be expensive.</p>
<p>I further asked how to raise it to get it to this point. He said, "Every day, cut up dragonfly larvae and throw them into the water. If it is very cold, prevent it from freezing. You must take it out of the water and store it in a box to prevent it from being exposed to the cold air outside and maintain the temperature, so that it will not die. When it comes to early spring, or around the Qingming Festival, put it back in the water, and its hair will still open up, and the color will remain unchanged. It may even have golden threads, and the bottom carapace is white, like ivory. The spine has a three-ridged shape, but it should not be too big, and smaller is better. The most extreme ones are only the size of five-zhu coins, which are particularly difficult to obtain. If you can keep it, it can not only avoid the poison of snakes and scorpions, but also prevent fires." As he spoke, he truly had the air of holding a rare commodity. Since no one bought it, he eventually carried it away. After a while, an old man, Mr. So-and-so, laughed and said, "This turtle is not born that way, but man-made." Everyone asked him why. He said, "If you apply mashed ginger juice to the turtle's carapace every day and prevent it from getting wet, it will eventually grow green moss, and then raise it in water, gradually lengthening and floating all over the jar." Although I have not tried this, I dare not fully believe it, but his words are not unreasonable, so I write it down to verify with the readers.</p>

<p>Also, there are many "Zhao" surnames in Guangdong, and "Bo" surnames in Yunnan. One of the author's friends has the surname "Xu." Among the police chiefs in my county's public security force, there is a "Sheng" surname. According to him, he is a descendant of General Nian Gengyao. When the clan was reduced in those years, his young son escaped and changed his surname "Nian" to "Sheng," with the top of the character protruding upward, to show that he had escaped from death and hoped for a day of success! Because it is very meaningful, it is attached for your information.</p>

<p>Chapter 21: Wan Yi is at everyone's disposal, pitying her moon-like beauty. The enraged husband is lectured, listening to the lion's roar from the next room.</p>
<p>Zhiqian smiled at him and was about to reply when he heard a loud thud from the partition, as if someone had sat down hard on the chair, and the back of the chair hit the wall with a sound. Then the woman said loudly: You don't need to be so scared. If anything goes wrong, your wife will take responsibility, it's none of your business. The director replied very gently: I'm afraid of you. I didn't make a sound, why are you still angry? The woman said: Even if you didn't make a sound, your expression was very telling. After this sentence, the room was silent, without any sound. First there was the sound of striking a match, then the sound of a teacup pouring tea, then the sound of a teacup hitting the table. The woman opened her mouth and said: I want to drink something cold, you ask the waiter to come. This sister-in-law, please sit down, your little feet can't stand for long. So the director's voice calling for the waiter came out one after another. The waiter's very peaceful voice asking what was needed came out. The wife said: Bring me a few bottles of Dutch water. The waiter said: We don't have spicy water, only chili oil. The director said: Hey! She wants soda water. The waiter said: Ah! Soda water. Usually it's one yuan for two bottles, but now I'm afraid... The wife said: Just bring it, I'll pay one yuan for one bottle. The waiter said: No, I'm afraid Zhengzhou hasn't sent any yet. It won't be available until after the Dragon Boat Festival. The wife said: Go, what are you talking about if you don't have it? Come back, what kind of fruit do you have here? The waiter said: We don't have much now, unless it's pears. The wife said: Pears are fine, how much can you buy for one yuan? The waiter said: One or two jin? The wife said: Hey! Don't play dumb, take two yuan and give it to the waiter to buy pears. So the silver coins clanked a few times, and the waiter walked out. Then she said: Hey! You go out too, I want to say a few words to this sister-in-law. The director said: You just say what you want to say, I won't interrupt. The wife said: You can't help but interrupt, anyway, I don't want you in the room. Are you going or not? As she said this, her tone became much heavier. (371)</p>

<h3>西北行</h3>
<p>— 王穀</p>
<p>— Wang Gu</p>
<p>—The Yellow River and Tongguan—</p>
<p>After the train passed Zhengzhou, it rushed into a desolate land. There was not a single tree in sight, not even a small blade of grass. The wilderness of Jiangnan, with its green flavor all over the ground, is probably something that has never even been imagined here! Yellow, black, and scorched are its colors and descriptions. The only trick to punctuate the railway and keep passengers from falling into monotony and tedium is the endless stream of mountain tunnels, one after another, and another. Just as you exit the first tunnel, before entering the second, on the right-hand side, a shimmering ribbon reflecting sunlight appears in the distance, darting in and out from the corners of the dirt mountains and from the low-lying edges of the plains, surging into the eyes of the travelers. This is the Yellow River, which has killed tens of millions of people!</p>
<p>"The Yellow River!" someone on the train exclaimed with a sound that seemed both delighted and moved. I was naturally happy to have finally seen this monster. So I climbed to the window and stretched my neck to look at it carefully. The train was obliging, gradually moving closer to the bank of the Yellow River. At that moment, I realized that its name was perfectly accurate. Yellow, yellow! Yellow indeed! It truly deserves to be called the Yellow River! If I were to speak even more truthfully, it could be called the Red River! Its water is muddier than the lees of Shaoxing wine, even richer in red ochre pigment. The waves are large, the tides are rapid, and the entire scene is a yellow ocean, rolling forward. Looking at its riverbed, judging from the banks, it is probably even higher than the plains on this side of the embankment! It is no accident or surprise that the monster has become a monster and is revered as the Yellow Peril. At that time, there were many peasants on the bank busy carrying mud to repair the embankment. The embankment they were repairing was at most less than ten feet wide. If the monster were pleased to unleash its power and break a few openings, I think this would be an undisputed and unquestionable matter.</p>
<p>The scenery dotting the banks of the Yellow River is well worth mentioning, and that is the relics of ancient times! Cave dwellings! Still existing in this world.</p>
<p>This bestial type of housing consists of a small dirt mountain, with little change and clayey soil. A large cave is dug, and that is home. Marrying a wife, having sons, everything takes place here. When I saw these "man-caves" to the left and right, scattered on all the flatter dirt mountains along the banks of the Yellow River, I felt an indescribable sadness. But I heard an old man from southern Henan say, "This is paradise! Warm in winter, cool in summer, it doesn't need to be repaired for a hundred or eighty years. The best thing is: in times of war, you can block the entrance and save your life." Oh! So that's how it is! The Chinese are truly tolerant! Dirt caves are paradise! Dirt caves are paradise!" I couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>The train traveled along the river, sometimes the roadbed (railway subgrade) was only a dozen feet wide, but several dozen feet high, and the train shook and swayed so madly! On the right was the rushing torrent of ten thousand galloping horses, which really made people feel like they were playing hide-and-seek with life. But the Chinese are resilient and bold, and no one cried out "Ah!" They just slipped along to Tongguan.</p>
<p>Tongguan is a famous place, and its appearance is much the same as described above. However, there are even more "man-caves," the dirt mountains are larger, higher, stretching for dozens of miles, and layered seven or eight deep. The dangerous terrain that the ancients called "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand cannot pass" is probably the winding and tangled formation of these dirt mountains. What is also surprising and pleasing is that there are trees now, especially the white poplar trees that look like large feather dusters, standing in rows, straight and tall white trunks, matched with dignified and deep green leaves, with a hint of the ancient lofty scholars. I recalled Guo Moruo's poem, "The bright moon is clear, the sound of the white poplars is rustling." I think that even without wind, there is indeed this rustling feeling.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The bullish forces are deemed too weak; gold prices retreat; silver prices rise but fail to sustain, resulting in a decline of 4.7 yuan.</p>
<p>After the previous upward trend in the gold market, unexpectedly, the floating long positions suddenly increased. Foreign banks were not satisfied yesterday, and it was difficult to rally on the floor. Major players took the opportunity to exert pressure, and scattered long positions suddenly showed signs of wavering, leading to a gradual decline. Initially, the overseas silver market showed a slight rise in London and stability in the U.S. There were rumors that the U.S. and India would purchase after the market closed, while sellers watched from the sidelines. The forward silver market in Monte Carlo showed mixed fluctuations, and exchange rates contracted across the board. Spot gold in London decreased by half a penny. The Central Bank's listed prices showed stability for both the U.S. and the UK. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 1146.6 yuan. Market sentiment was weak, and off-market pre-market trading opened at 49 and 50 yuan, then retreated to 48.9 yuan. The morning opened with low prices, and selling pressure increased after the opening, leading to a further decline. However, major players maintained support at the lower levels. The HSBC Bank's listed prices were announced, showing stability for both the U.S. and the UK, with a slight recovery. However, due to the widespread selling by long positions, the supply in the market exceeded demand, and prices continued to fall. American oil companies and other foreign firms still had settlements to make. The silver equalization tax was listed with an increase of 0.05. Bidding continued midway, but the floating long positions could no longer sustain themselves, and the trend continued to decline. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to become active, and prices rallied briefly. Major players exerted pressure at the higher levels, and the upward trend was blocked. The Indian silver forecast was for an increase of 0.04 anna. A sudden surge of fluctuations occurred at noon. Due to the residual effects after the noon closing, the after-market had once fallen to 43 yuan. Major players, including Yuanyi Heng, Yu Fuxing, and Yong, maintained support at the lower levels and were pulled up after the opening, which was easily maintained due to scattered sellers. Major players became slightly active, and prices gradually recovered. The initial report for Indian silver showed an increase of 0.05 anna. After the rise, there were more long positions. At this point, market conditions showed minimal changes due to the mediocre exchange rate market. As major buyers remained on the sidelines and floating long positions came to unwind again, Indian silver once reported no change but fell to 42.6 yuan. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to pursue purchases, and prices finally returned to stability. The future trend is likely to advance or retreat depending on the array of chips. The market conditions for the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1148.5 yuan, a decrease of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Huixiang, Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, and Shunli immediately sold at 1147.1 yuan. Fuxing, Yongheng, Yu Chunyuan, Yongfu, and Yu Shangna rose to 1148.1 yuan. Shunli, Fuxing, Yong Yuanchang, and Yong Richang sold off, falling to 1146.8 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yong Richang, and Chunyuan Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy in again at 1148.3 yuan. It was anticipated that the HSBC Bank's listed prices would be unchanged and turn stable. Huixiang, Yongli, Dingkang, Dadecheng, Hengchang, and Yong sold off, falling to 1146.6 yuan. Dadecheng, Yongli, and Shangna, with the silver equalization tax rising by 0.25, rose to 1147.7 yuan. Yingxiang, Dadecheng, Futai, Yong Shunmao, Huixiang, and Richang continuously supplied, falling to 1145.6 yuan. Wanfeng, Fuxing, Yongheng, Yu Yingfeng, Heng Yifeng, Shui Dadecheng took advantage of the low prices to purchase bars, rising to 1147.7 yuan. Yuanmao Yong and Yongli sold, and soon retreated to 1146 yuan. At this time, because Dadecheng, Tongyu Run, and others continued to maintain support, it rose to 1147.2 yuan. Yongli and Hengyu continued to sell. The Indian silver forecast was a large increase of 0.04 anna, and actually fell to 1144.3 yuan. However, buyers maintained support at the lower levels, rising to 1145.3 yuan. The noon closing was 1145.2 yuan, and the closing was weak as Fusheng, Yong Lichang, and others sold bars.</p>
<p>The opening price in the afternoon was 1144.2 yuan, and numerous small sellers competed to sell, once falling to 1143.6 yuan. Tongyi, Chunyuan, Yong Dingkang, Hengyu, and Huixiang took bars, rising to 1145 yuan. Qingfa, Yong Huixiang, and Fuyu took advantage of the high prices to sell off, falling to 1144.3 yuan. Dadecheng, Hengchang Yong, and Shangna rose to 1145.3 yuan. Huixiang sold bars, with the initial report for Indian silver showing an increase of 4.5 anna, falling to 1144.6 yuan. Chunyuan Yong and Shang entered above 1145 yuan, and the situation turned stable. Later, when the second report for Indian silver showed no change, Riyu Fuyu and Wanfeng sold off, retreating to 1142.6 yuan. Dadecheng, Hengyu, and Huixiang took advantage of the low prices to take bars, gradually rising to 1145.4 yuan. Qianyuan Yong sold off, and the closing price was 1145 yuan, slightly stable after the closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was announced with the Central Bank's standard gold price retreating to 1146.6 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 1 yuan lower, more than 4 yuan lower than the previous closing price. The ledger price for this month is 1136 yuan, and for the first month it is 1145 yuan. The morning water top-up was 1136 yuan, and the afternoon was the same price. The price of pure gold was reduced by 2 yuan, to 1146.5 yuan. Spot market conditions were stable. Refined gold was increased by 4 to 5 yuan.

Yifeng Heng paid Yuanmao Yong 7 bars, at 1148 yuan. The overall trend seemed to have stabilized, mainly because there were many hedgers outside of 1148 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was normal. Overall, Qingfa Yong, Fuxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Hengchang Yong, Yicheng, Fuyu, Dingkang, Qianyuan Changxiang, and Xieheng were among the buyers.

The trading volume of the Guangdong gang Hengxing Shengda was still small.</p>
<p>The market conditions for the day were relatively weak. The morning opening price was 1148.5 yuan, and the after-market closing price was 1145 yuan. The highest price was 1146.5 yuan in the first market, and the lowest price was 1142.6 yuan in the second market. The total fluctuation was 5.9 yuan. As a result, it fell back 4.7 yuan compared to the previous closing price. There are 476 bars remaining for this month, excluding public orders.

<h3>Silver Prices Rise; Foreign Exchange Trends Harden —Extremely Quiet Trading—</h3>
<p>According to foreign reports yesterday, London large bars for near-month delivery (16.25) were selling flat in the forward market. It was said that the U.S. and India would purchase after the market closed, but one party was hesitant. New York silver prices were unchanged. The forward silver market in Monte Carlo fluctuated by 0.01 up and 0.015 down. Spot gold in London decreased by half a penny. The British pound fell by 0.0185 against the U.S. dollar and by 0.09 against the French franc. The U.S. dollar rose by 0.00625 against the British pound and by 0.005 against the French franc.

The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. Market sentiment was weak. After the opening, prices slightly loosened. However, due to the HSBC Bank's listed prices being stable for both the U.S. and the UK, banks traded against each other, and the market was still stable. American oil companies and other foreign firms still had settlements to make. Since the silver equalization tax was announced with an increase of 0.015, it was still able to maintain, lacking changes and with few transactions. Later, because the forecast for Indian silver was a large increase of 0.04 anna, market sentiment was exhausted. The trend recovered at noon. Although the after-market was still loose, banks had little appetite, and there were few transactions. The process was still stable. When the initial report for Indian silver came, showing an increase of 0.045 anna, it had little impact. Although Chinese merchants appeared weak, the domestic market was still mediocre. By the closing, the near-term selling prices for British exchange were 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.5 and 0.5625 paired, and for U.S. exchange it was 29.8125 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, both the British and U.S. dollars loosened by 0.000625. The forward market was the same. American oil companies and foreign firms still had settlements to make, while Chinese merchants lacked activity. The transaction prices for the day are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The bond market saw a strong surge at the end of the session; initially declined due to selling by the "Gold Gang"; ultimately soared due to price manipulation by major players.</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to wavering market sentiment and renewed selling by the "Gold Gang," coupled with the tense situation in North China, major players manipulated prices, focusing on the "54" bond, supported by the "46" bond, with "32" and "43" bonds and others following the trend. Market prices initially fell, then stabilized, and ultimately rose. The entities driving the price rally changed daily, buying on dips and attempting to overcome the environment through sheer force. Thus, the outflow of spot goods presented a favorable opportunity. There were rumors that only half of the "Gold Gang" had sold off, and that some were reversing their positions. However, with such strong manipulation, the market price is unlikely to decline in a straight line unless there is a drastic change in the environment or multiple players are satisfied. This is true of the trading floor, but market sentiment has never truly shifted. The daily flight from cash or spot goods to purchase foreign currency is becoming increasingly common. If banks were to further reduce interest rates, the flight from cash would intensify, and the financial sector would inevitably be shaken. There is much turmoil ahead for the bond market, and it is not limited to the situation in North China. There were a total of three sessions yesterday. In the morning session, the "11" bond saw the most selling, with the "35" and "65" Gold Gang's selling continuously. The "4," "30," "34," and "47" bonds also saw selling. Buyers were weak, and market prices plummeted by several jiao to one yuan. The afternoon session opened with continued selling by the Northern Gang, while the "32" and "43" bonds had stronger buying appetites. Market prices were weak initially but strong later, with most recovering four or five jiao. At the close, the "54" bond made every effort to raise prices, offering particularly high prices. Those selling off took the opportunity to raise prices, and the surge was very strong. The "20" bond even rose by more than 1.4 yuan. The market prices ultimately saw mixed results, with more gains than losses, ranging from 0.05 to 0.78 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 15 million yuan. The comparison of the gains and losses is listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Speculators Begin Short Selling</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (December 2) the New York stock market fell. Activity was minimal throughout the day, but trading suddenly became lively in the final hour. Speculators, seeing that the market lacked momentum for a uniform rise, began selling and shorting. Small exchange stocks were stagnant and mixed. Bonds were quiet. The total daily transaction volume was 1.52 million shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Date | December 30 | December 2 | Change</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 142.35 | 140.72 | Down 1.63</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Continue; Yarn Market Unlikely to Decline Soon</p>
<p>The yarn market initially weakened but then strengthened, and the situation remains positive. This is because spot yarn sales are showing signs of development, and Sichuan merchants are also opening their wallets, bolstering market sentiment. However, most traders tend to short sell because market prices have reached high levels. Nevertheless, cotton prices are exceptionally high, and the financial sector is unilaterally buying for forward months, closing out large numbers of limits and refusing to release stock.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Near Months</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning with slight increases in each month, due to the lingering momentum from the previous month and improved news from overseas cotton markets. However, selling pressure slightly increased and prices fell during the second session due to news of declining government bonds. Prices rebounded in the third session due to firm raw cotton prices. The market closed flat and weak, with each month falling 0.01, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06 yuan respectively compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened quietly. However, buying interest revived during the second and third sessions due to robust cotton prices and reports of developing spot yarn transactions. The market closed weak but then strengthened, with the near months falling 0.01 to 0.03 yuan compared to the morning closing price and the far months rising 0.01, 0.01, and 0.04 yuan. Jinchang sold 650 bales, Gengfeng 1,050 bales, Shenji 400 bales, Yuan Yi 2,450 bales, Taichang 9 bales, Yongchang 1,200 bales, Tonghe 400 bales, and Xincheng 450 bales. Tongfu bought 500 bales, Dafu 950 bales, Dafeng 1,400 bales, Changfeng 1,600 bales, Yongda 750 bales, Shenxun 500 bales, and Zhenda 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Stock on Account</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>

<h3>Export Transactions Uninterrupted; Cotton Prices Firm; While Traders Tend to Sell Off, Foreign Firms Continue to Buy</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains firm, and the situation is excellent. This is because spot cotton export transactions have not stopped. There are rumors that American merchant Meian and Indian merchant Fuji, who bought cotton last month, are shipping overseas. This has further bolstered market sentiment, and they are continuing to buy this month, causing the market to become tighter. However, most traders tend to sell off.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Afternoon Short Covering</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, falling back 0.05 to 0.25 yuan due to profit-taking after the large rise on the previous day. However, foreign firms continued to buy during the second and third sessions, and the yarn market rebounded, further tightening the cotton market. The market closed flat. Each month's price changed inconsistently compared to the previous day's closing price, fluctuating by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The market remained firm after the afternoon opening. Weihe again covered their shorts, and with the continued reduction of American cotton fields for four years, the market became more popular, and the upward trend resumed. Each month rose 0.10 to 0.20 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Dafu sold 1,000 dan, Tongji 1,700 dan, Hexing 3,200 dan, Taichang 1,500 dan, Changfeng 2,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,000 dan, Weihe 1,900 dan, Gengfeng 2,200 dan, Runkang 1,000 dan, and Xincheng 2,800 dan.

<h3>Limited New American Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices up 1 to 3 points across various months, but trading was sluggish. Traders were awaiting the announcement of next year's cotton management policies. Liverpool's news was positive, prompting traders and foreign firms to buy. Later, cotton farmers engaged in hedging sales, and winter positions were closed, causing the market to soften. However, the overall trend remained firm, and short positions were eager to cover. New buying was limited. Before the close, most activity consisted of short covering and trader buying. The market now requires a period of calm. Textile products are experiencing sluggish demand. According to a survey by the Cotton Exchange, global U.S. cotton stocks, including unpicked cotton, totaled 16,981,000 bales as of October 31st, compared to 17,295,000 bales last year. The average global stock for the preceding five years was 20,071,000 bales. The closing was firm, with spot prices up 5 points and futures up 4 to 7 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 1 point, while futures rose by 23 points. In Indian cotton trading, initial short covering offset selling by Japanese firms in the morning. Later, positive news from Liverpool strengthened the market. Flat Gou increased by 2.5 rupees, Oomra by 2.75 rupees, and White Gou by 2.25 rupees. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Grains: Manufacturers Dump Forward Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market opened with generally quiet conditions across all months. Foreign wheat quotes continued to decline slightly by one-tenth of a cent. Industry sentiment remained relatively stable. However, due to the unfavorable situation in the north, there was little activity from out-of-town merchants, and speculators were unable to profit from the circumstances. Consequently, only over ten thousand bags were traded, and market prices showed little vitality. In the afternoon, trading suddenly became brisk, and market prices sharply declined by two to three cents. This was due to rumors that foreign wheat could be combined for planning purposes, and manufacturers simultaneously dumped forward contracts, totaling approximately fifty to sixty thousand bags. A portion of the bulls, mindful of the unstable situation, also aggressively sold, causing prices to fall by two cents across all months. It is feared that the trend will be temporarily weakened due to the approaching end of the lunar calendar year.</p>

<h3>Limited Chips: Wheat Market Shows Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the opening of the futures wheat market, trading remained sluggish across all months. Only the current month and the February and March months saw an opening price, while the rest were unbid. Prices fluctuated little compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, trading picked up somewhat, but market fluctuations were limited to only two or three cents. This was due to the limited number of chips, the approaching end of the year, and the pessimistic situation in the north. In this environment, buyers and sellers alike adopted a cautious approach. The spot wheat market remained stable, with delivery not smooth. Shandong Yingzhou wheat was priced at 5.06 yuan, Linhuai Pass wheat at 5.056 yuan, and Quanjiao wheat at 5.05 yuan. Fuxin shipped 1,500 bags, and Xinda shipped 800 bags.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Fall as Supply Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, supplies from various sources increased, with over 70 firms arriving (totaling over 14,000 shi of goods). Sales in this street were mediocre, and the market sentiment turned soft. Thick early japonica rice fell by one to two jiao, while thin indica rice was secured in lots by Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other dealers, totaling six to seven thousand bags. Therefore, the market was tentatively stabilized. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan saw similar supply and demand, and prices were also stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Supplies came from 63 or 64 sources. Retail sales of white japonica rice were sluggish. Dealers took short positions, causing market prices to decline by another one to two jiao. Early indica rice was mediocre, and thin indica rice continued to be secured in lots, with prices weakening by several points. Yangbu Jian was stable, as was Du Ke Jian. The prices of all other goods also weakened.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian's Weakening Trend Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market conditions did not improve. This was mainly because arrivals had been continuous for several days. Goods from the Yangtze River region, such as Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan, continued to arrive. Deliveries north of the Yangtze River remained stagnant. Speculators adopted a wait-and-see attitude, relying solely on sales in this street, inevitably leading to a gradual weakening of the market. However, yesterday, goods from Zhejiang, such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou rice, were scarce, and owners were no longer eager to sell. Therefore, the weakening trend turned stable, resulting in a situation of apparent weakness but concealed price declines. Throughout the day, dealers in this street shipped 2,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 550 bags of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice, and 100 bags of Anqing rice. Foreign rice firms and hoarders maintained their positions. Yesterday, 100 bags of Siam machine-milled rice were opened for sale at the same previous price of 9.4 yuan. All rice was shipped by dealers in this street.</p>
<h3>Sesame and Soybeans See Minor Sales</h3>
<p>Due to abnormally sluggish sales, the sesame market was unsettled. Yesterday, foreign firms sold only 100 tons, priced at 11.75 yuan, a slight increase of 5 points compared to the previous market. Spot raw sesame also saw sluggish transactions due to weak sales of refined goods, with trading stagnant. Only a few Japanese dealers were active, resulting in a high-flat-subsequently-soft market. In the soybean market, factories shipped 11 truckloads of Bengbu beans yesterday. The initial price was 4.32 yuan, later raised to 4.38 yuan. Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and local dealers still had an appetite for Du beans and Zha beans, and prices rose by two or three points. Total transactions for all beans amounted to over 1,700 bags.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Re-refined Sugar Price Increases by One Dime Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, the association set the price for No. 14 coarse granulated white spot goods at 22.8 yuan, unchanged. Transit goods were priced at 6.8 yuan, a decrease of one dime. The factory's Mian Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 remained at 20.8 yuan, with the rest following suit. There were over 300 bags of re-refined sugar opened by Chao dealers, with sack merchants pricing them at 12.8 yuan, an increase of one dime. Another common merchant priced it at 11.3 yuan. The market picture was stable. High-grade Qing Shao was opened for sale at 8.8 yuan. Dong No. 4 white was opened at 21.8 to 21.85 yuan. The remaining Dong Chi and Nos. 8 and 9 white were all at their original prices, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Prices Soar, Shanghai Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, due to a sudden surge in demand from Hong Kong and Guangdong dealers, as well as Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants, over a thousand bags of Longkou vermicelli and dried noodles were shipped. As a result, the opening price rose by approximately one yuan, to 23.3 yuan, with retail sales at 23 yuan. However, according to Longkou telegrams, production prices are soaring, with each bag already rising to 33.6 yuan. The cost per dan in Shanghai is approximately 26 yuan, a significant difference. It is unlikely that the prices will converge in the short term, and Shanghai prices are bound to continue rising.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Many Woolens Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, woolen cloth sales were very brisk. As the weather gradually turns cold, sales are in season, causing prices to rise across the board. Straight-line flannels, thick broadcloth, camel hair, plain thick cloth, Lan Hu cloth, riding breeches cloth, herringbone twill, Melton overcoat cloth, and various suit woolens are still on the rise. Domestically produced French cashmere, Mazong lining, mercerized feather gauze, and black carbon lining are also continuing to rise in price. All transactions require cash payment, resulting in limited credit sales. Customers generally adopt a policy of buying only what they sell.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Export Statistics for the Second Half of Last Month</h3>

<p>From December 16th to 30th, the second half of the month, raw silk exports totaled 4,065 bales. Including 1,905 bales of waste silk, the total was 5,970 bales.</p>
<h3>Zhen Mei Green Tea Sells Well in France</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market continued to be brisk. Rowsheng, Chouxin, and ordinary Zhen Mei green teas from Yih He, Yongxing, and other firms were replenished, making the market quite lively. Chouxin Zhen Mei was sold at an opening price of 90 yuan, with little fluctuation compared to the previous price. In addition, Needle Mei and Tu Mei varieties also saw many negotiations. The market is currently brewing for a move. However, the sales of all types of black tea remained sluggish.</p>

<h3>Our Ancient Artifacts Making a Big Splash</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The collection of Chinese antiquities that was publicly exhibited in Shanghai and then transported to England aboard the British cruiser "Suffolk" was officially unveiled at Burlington House in London on the 28th of last month, under the auspices of the British Royal Academy of Arts. On the first day, over three thousand people visited, and the venue was unprecedentedly crowded. According to the gatekeeper, "I have never seen an art exhibition with so many visitors. It is truly rare." A larger number of foreigners also visited the exhibition. One could hear the languages of various European countries in the venue. Approximately forty individuals recognized as experts in Chinese art were specially dispatched to the event by major European newspapers to report on the exhibition. The King and Queen of England, along with members of the royal family, also attended the exhibition. A preview was held the day before, and important figures from England and other countries rushed to attend. Many scholars are planning to conduct long-term research in the venue. A large, well-known clothing store in Paris has even incorporated Chinese patterns and colors into its new clothing designs. Observers praised the exquisite beauty of the artifacts and the thoughtfulness of the arrangement, saying that at a time when British artistic concepts need a new supplement, this exhibition will have a significant impact on British art. It is said that the exhibition will close in March of next year.</p>
<p>The image of China in the minds of foreigners is one of queues, bound feet, and opium. This public exhibition of antiquities in London can be considered a big splash. Art from China's past dynasties spanning 3,500 years is displayed together for people to see, earning the admiration of people from all over Europe. It is truly a great honor for our country.</p>
<p>We are extremely happy to hear that our ancient artifacts are so well-received in England. Their enthusiastic attendance may be driven by a desire for excitement, curiosity, or a desire for reference and research. In any case, we believe that this exhibition of antiquities may change foreigners' preconceived notions of China, making them realize that China, in addition to queues, bound feet, and opium, also possesses a valuable ancient culture.</p>
<p>Although we are happy, we should at least have two recognitions. First, our ancient culture did indeed shine brightly, enough to make us proud of the world. But this is past glory. To maintain this glory, we should not, like a group of restorationists, stubbornly cling to the old and refuse to make progress. We must redouble our efforts to promote our inherent culture, so that it can be immortalized in the world. Second, culture is progressive and changes with the way of life of human beings. If our country wants to stand in the present era, ancient culture alone is not enough. We must have a new culture in order to compete for survival with other countries. Therefore, we must have the determination to abandon the old culture of our country that is not suitable for today, and we should have the courage to accept foreign culture that is beneficial to our nation. This is the awareness that cultural movement workers in our country should have at present.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to remind our compatriots that the ancient artifacts from our country that are being exhibited in England are now enjoying great popularity in London, but they once experienced a small catastrophe. Everyone must still remember the story of the southward transportation of the antiquities. These thousands of artifacts were moved to Shanghai during the precarious situation in Pingjin. How long ago was it that the antiquities were being exhibited abroad, and the north was once again in turmoil, truly causing people to feel boundless regret. It is possible that after the antiquities are transported back to China one day, the homeland of these antiquities will have lost its original glory.</p>
<h3>The Cowardly Man</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>Yun Da, as gentle as the weather today, combed his hair so smoothly and beautifully, holding his beloved collection of short stories by Chekhov. He planned to have lunch at the restaurant and then take a walk in Huishan Park, which he hadn't visited for a long time. Because he loved chrysanthemums, in the gentle sunlight of early winter, he could deeply inhale the fragrant scent exuded by the brightly colored chrysanthemums. It was as if he were immersed in the arms of his beloved. He loved chrysanthemums because his missed daughter's name was Qiuju!</p>
<p>"However, the missed daughter? It's like a dream!"</p>
<p>He often sighed like this, and often thought about the unspeakable joy of her being willing to lower her proud nature to see him, or the unique flavor of accidentally bumping into her. He often fantasized, and sometimes lost sleep over the imagined melancholy and pain of the missed Qiuju.</p>
<p>But a very good opportunity came, he didn't need to go to the park to see the quiet chrysanthemums, he saw the Qiuju he was thinking about. Suddenly, she appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>At that time, he was just eating in the restaurant when suddenly a girl in a black coat ran past the front of the restaurant, and intentionally looked at him. But by the time he determined that she was indeed the Qiuju he was thinking about, she had already run far away. He thought to himself, "That's right, she probably knew I was eating here, maybe she misses me too, so she deliberately ran past here. But she's so proud! She ran without looking back, and she ran so twistingly." But could he also shamelessly chase after her, dragging her like catching a little bird? Moreover, he had been separated from her for half a year. Although he would never forget her charming eyes and her funny and teasing little lips during this half a year. But would she forgive him, and comfort him without any resentment? He thought, he was distressed, and the idea of going to see the fragrant chrysanthemums at first vanished. What echoed in his depressed heart was a thin shadow, a face that only glanced proudly at his eating mouth. He stared painfully at the half-eaten rice and vegetables. He suddenly picked up Chekhov's collection of short stories and ran out of the restaurant:</p>
<p>"She deliberately came to provoke me, this little devil, what am I still eating for! I'm going to chase after her, I'm going to muster up my courage, I'm going to tell her about the pain of missing her for half a year, I'm going to..."</p>
<p>His heart was anxious and painful. He ran out of the restaurant door and looked on the chaotic road, running, a little dizzy and almost crazy. He cursed himself:</p>
<p>"Qiuju, where have you gone? Do you really not want me? You're so cruel!"</p>
<p>He ran, and such a neatly dressed and attractive young man running on the road made people notice him even more, perhaps thinking he was crazy, but he didn't care. His heart had only one goal: "Catch up with Qiuju, I have to tell her how much I love her, and how much I've lost my balance, I'm simply crazy. Even if she doesn't want to show that she loves me, maybe she still loves me, anyway, I have to do that, she ran here herself!" He cursed, turned a corner, and was already on Baoding Road. On the sparsely populated sidewalk, he could see Qiuju's back, walking slowly, and a little like a child. The wind blew her black hair, the wind blew her black coat. At this time, she turned her face to look at him. Knowing that he had indeed chased after her like crazy, she deliberately teased him by turning a corner and heading west from Kunming Road. His heart became frightened, perhaps she was unhappy that he had chased after her, and she ran so fast, as if ignoring him. But why did she keep turning her head to look at him? He didn't know what to do at all, and his heart became painful.</p>
<p>But he loved her, and he was afraid of her. The shadows of suffering in his soul were attacking each other. Although he didn't dare to run in front of her and shake her hand, he was like iron being attracted by her magnetism. Although he was scolding himself: "Cowardly man! Since you don't have the courage to go to a woman, and moreover Qiuju whom you love, but follow behind her, isn't that your own ugliness and shows that you are of no use? Maybe she's scolding you, laughing at you, and hating you! Maybe she's laughing at you for being a despicable person because you don't have the courage to throw yourself into her arms and just circle around!" Like this! He understood that he was entirely a character described by the great short story writer Chekhov! He really wanted to scold himself! However, although he was scolding himself, he couldn't leave her and run away immediately. He really had no choice but to follow her in the distant corner. She kept turning her head to look at him, knowing that he was still a cowardly man. Sometimes she smiled bitterly when she turned her head, sometimes she deliberately slowed down a little, and sometimes she ran very fast. He was simply an idiot, circling around with her for many laps, from Dalianwan Road to Zhoujiazui Road, turned to Gongping Road, circled back to Gongping Road, and to Yuezhou Road. He thought she would definitely take the No. 18 trolleybus, but she met three or four girls at this place. She only glanced at him. He was in a distant corner, cowardly and painfully, as if he had softened and wanted to fall to the ground, watching them innocently laughing and running away. At that time, she turned her head to look at him truly painfully and sadly. He could see clearly that she was thin and in pain, not the Qiuju who used to chat and laugh intimately with him half a year ago. They disappeared into a school on Zhaofeng Road, and he wandered despondently on the road, simply cursing himself for being a useless cowardly man. But he knew that he was more than brave when he wasn't in front of a woman.</p>
<p>Sadly, he glazed his eyes over on the No. 18 trolley bus:</p>
<p>"I'll still go to the park to see the chrysanthemums! Suffering! Chekhov had already described me in his novel. But I love her, no matter how she makes me sad!"</p>
<h3>The Cave at Takadanobaba</h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Tokyo, some friends would ask upon meeting, “Have you been to Ginza?” or “What about Nihonbashi? Shinjuku? Asakusa?” But I, seemingly unfazed, hadn't been to any of them.</p>
<p>Only Shinjuku had I been dragged to by a friend: However, in the urban heat, the seductive faces, the mingling car sounds, and the panting smoke, I felt somewhat numb, and didn't sniff out any new flavor. However, I did hear some fresh perspectives from the students:</p>
<p>"This place, it's so good. Everything is so orderly. You can't even find a beggar on the streets. It's simply worlds apart from China."</p>
<p>"...Ah... You can't even see poor people..."</p>
<p>I'm not too clear on these things, but it's perhaps that compared to the suffocating homeland, I felt somewhat more "free". It seemed I had some intuitive awareness of this.</p>
<p>After all, I should be sightseeing, in this new foreign land, this civilized foreign land. I prefer mountains and waters, or at least being near water or mountains, where I can breathe in a few mouthfuls of fresh air, and make my body and mind feel somewhat more expansive and free. So, my friend accompanied me to Takadanobaba. It was a small hilltop; but in Tokyo, it was already considered quite high, and supposedly a fun place to go.</p>
<p>"Standing on the hilltop, can you see Mount Fuji?"</p>
<p>Although the hilltop was neither big nor tall, I was happy just to see the verdant color. There were many people on the hilltop, and all around, especially children, scurrying about. Since I hadn't climbed a mountain in nearly ten years, scaling the hilltop in leather shoes and descending the sloping hillside felt a little questionable at first. But the path beside me was too narrow, so I had to slide down.</p>
<p>I raised my eyes and looked around, searching for a long time, but couldn't see Mount Fuji. My friend asked the Japanese in Japanese, but still no luck. Probably, the beautiful Mount Fuji was hidden by clouds and mist today! It was a little disappointing.</p>
<p>Looking around again, it felt a little dull. The tourists were walking around, just standing and looking, and there wasn't any captivating music to listen to.</p>
<p>Is this what the fun Takadanobaba is like?</p>
<p>I urged my companion to go home. We walked in silence, smelling the scent of horse manure. My companion then explained to me. When he first arrived in Tokyo ten years ago, the area around Takadanobaba was still wilderness! The nearby wide roads and bustling shops were newly built later. This hilltop used to be a training ground for horses. He expressed a sense of comparing the past and the present. As for me, I was still bored. Impatiently, I exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Let's go down! Better to go home quickly, it's almost dusk."</p>
<p>But as we turned around, we suddenly saw on the side of the hill, in the desolate and chaotic vegetation, people with ragged clothes, and mountain caves, grass nests, that looked like the dwellings of animals. I quickly composed myself and looked closely. There were about seven or eight caves, big and small, lined up. The cave dwellings of the ancients were now reappearing here.</p>
<p>Under the messy grass and tree branches was the entrance to the cave. It wasn't very deep inside, and you could only vaguely see a patch of darkness. What was clearly discernible was a human head with black hair as disheveled as withered grass, or just an upper body, with clothing that was black and white and riddled with holes, or a pair of frightening bare feet, exposed at the edge of the cave.</p>
<p>Two heads with particularly thick and disheveled hair were women's heads. There were also wriggling things inside, which were children. It was simply a bit frightening. Were they sleeping during the day, or did they only hide in such homes? How different were they from birds and beasts? What was their life like?</p>
<p>My companion actually stepped onto the small path, pushed aside the rattan, and approached step by step.</p>
<p>Perhaps in front of the fifth cave! An old man was slowly moving. In front of his cave were many messy things, like odds and ends picked up from a garbage heap, but the inside of the cave was empty. My companion went up to ask him, but I smelled an unpleasant odor and stepped back a few steps.</p>
<p>This was my first outing after arriving in Japan.</p>
<p>Broadcast Program</p>
<h3>Song Introductions</h3>
<p>Lovely Dreamland</p>
<p>(1) Showing off the charm and coyness of spring, and tired of hearing crows screeching the arrival of spring, I gaze at the fresh and beautiful flowers and grass, as if they are the remains of the past. Floating in dreamland, I also see the charming and coquettish tender spring, with a countenance so beautiful, truly joyful and carefree, and the dream soul is like a crow, flying around in mid-air, as high as the sun. (2) Alas, life is like a flower in brocade, how many times can one see spring like a painting? I fear I cannot hold onto even half a year, it is truly foolish to discard and not bear to part. Only dreamland is praiseworthy, I drift about as I please, without ties or worries, enjoying myself to the fullest. Facing a strong enemy, I neither scold nor fight, regardless of whether it is true or false, I return to the home of dreamland.</p>

<p>The spring day is breezy and the sun is just right. The spring breeze blows, wafting the fragrance of a hundred flowers. The beautiful spring scenery is like a return to home. Sulian does not wish to enjoy the spring scenery. Bingmei sits gloomily in the Aloeswood Pavilion. She anxiously calls for Lihua to hide the green window. Pitiful Bitao often grieves. Jinju's tears fill her eyes as she thinks of her parents. I think of the prosperous past of Changchunfu. My late father passed the imperial examination and his name was fragrant. He was bestowed with purple robes and jade belts by the emperor. He was enfeoffed at the High Tribute Jade Orchid Hall. He set up an incense table in the Rose Hall. He thanked Heaven in front of the Peony Pavilion. Who knew that the father and mother would fall ill and die one after another in Luoyang? Pitiful Dangzhi had no siblings. Shulan cried until her heart broke. At that time, it was. Falling flowers messed up the masterless home. With a heart full of grief, she cherished the thousand gold autumn begonias. Lihua was haggard, her delicate body thin. She did not wear jade hairpins or comb her hair. She did not think of tea or food during the day. At night, her thoughts were scattered on the bed. Yumeiren was ill in the hibiscus tent. Ruixiang, the maid, brought her tea. The cuckoo spat fresh red blood. Qiukui attended in the Fujian room. Fortunately, Huanggu came here. She saw the plantain and could not help but shed tears. She gently opened her cherry lips and called me. Deeply fearing that the zhuteng disease would be prolonged. She called Dongqing to quickly invite the doctor. He declared that the Helian flower prince was skilled in prescription. It turned out that the jasmine was a liver disease. It was necessary to use the Buddha's hand slices. Areca nut. Rose peony and previous medicinal soup of peony and mountain ginseng to take down. Fengxian slightly felt better. Ling Hehua often dripped with thoughts of her parents. The hydrangea cried for her parents in her dreams. A wutong leaf fell and took the coffin back to her homeland. With plum blossoms in the snow, she returned to the door. The ancestral hall was built in the apricot blossom pond.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Song of the Traveling Performers"</p>
<p>The sky is clear and the air is pleasant, taking advantage of the cool evening. I stroll leisurely on the streets. Arriving at, a square as flat as a mirror. Suddenly I hear, the sound of drums is noisy beside me. Idlers stop to surround and watch. Seeing there, miscellaneous objects are scattered haphazardly. Swords and spears. Monkeys and sheep. There are two or three pairs of performers. Before long, the sound of gongs stops. The performers, bowed and saluted to explain the details. They said. We are. Visiting friends coming here. We are from the same village in Shandong. At home, we rely on our parents. When we leave, we rely on the four directions. Our skills are not perfect, we are just here to make you laugh. Please, gentlemen, contribute a little to untie your purses and enjoy yourselves. The performance will begin shortly. We ask you to be especially tolerant. After speaking, they quickly retreat. The children's good show is about to begin. Somersaults turning round and round. Fist wind flying, weakness overcoming strength. A three-legged stool is laid diagonally on the table. They lean backward and drink tea upside down. After one act, they change to another. The monkey's good show is about to begin. Back and forth, galloping on the back of a sheep. He looks like a general on the battlefield. After one act is done, they change to another. The maiden's good show then begins. It is as if they are walking on flat ground on a flying rope. Advancing and retreating quickly and slowly as they please. The audience members are. Anxious one moment. Panicked the next. Everyone's heart is full of worry. Please look at a scroll of refugees. Hunger drives me to walk the winding road. Only those public gentlemen enjoy themselves endlessly.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Yangzi River Theater Society's Declaration of Establishment</h3>
<p>It cannot be said that spoken drama in China has not existed for quite a few years, but it has never been properly developed and truly become an art, and instead, the up-and-coming cinema has run ahead of it.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that those who were loyal to the drama movement did not resolutely embark on the path of professionalizing spoken drama. There are indeed professional drama troupes, but they are limited to civilized drama, which has created an unspoken concept in people's minds, that is, that magical drama will always have a minority of the audience. Therefore, it can never be professionalized. But we want to say that this is wrong, this is only because drama artists are unwilling to guide the audience, but only deliberately pretend to be profound, which is why they have pushed them out the door.</p>
<p>We therefore believe that if we apply a high degree of skill to the performance of healthy and easy-to-understand plays, we will certainly win some or even all of the audience from those irresponsible civilized dramas and various local operas, that is to say, spoken drama here will lay the foundation for professionalization.</p>
<p>This is our opinion, and we want to put it into practice, so there is the organization of the Yangtze River Theater Society, hoping that comrades who are enthusiastic about spoken drama will criticize, instruct, and assist us. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Art circles information reports: On the 28th, Shen Xiling expressed that he wanted to test-screen "Boat Girl", and someone in the company said: "Does this kind of movie also need to be test-screened?" The meaning between the lines is that "Boat Girl" doesn't need to be test-screened, and test-screening it would be tantamount to losing face.</p>
<p>However, "Boat Girl" unexpectedly announced on the first day that it was sold out, contrary to their expectations. Without relying on cover advertisements, and without specifying that there was a wedding performance short film in the advertisement, it was able to be a box office success. Shen Xiling is truly proud.</p>
<p>Let me add one more sentence: After the test-screening tickets for "Boat Girl" were issued, someone predicted that even during the test-screening, no one would watch "Boat Girl".</p>
<p>But what was the result? What made these people laugh and cry was the most eloquent fact.</p>
<p>It is said: Shen Xiling has asked Mingxing for leave to return to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>After "Boat Girl", there are also "Hero of the Times" and "Family Relations". We hope that these films can make money, or that Chinese films can still have some hope, or that the film audience's perception of Chinese films can get better.</p>

<h3>New York Auto Show Opens</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>More Than 300 New Cars Participate</p>
<p>The twenty-sixth American Auto Show opened on the 2nd of last month. The exhibition location is in the Grand Central Palace on Lexington Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets in New York. The duration is one week. The visiting hours are from 10:30 AM to 11:00 PM every day. More than 300 new cars of various colors for 1936 are displayed in the venue. There are 25 kinds made in the United States, 4 kinds made in the United Kingdom, and 1 kind made in Italy. In addition, there are 6 brands of trucks. There are about 60 manufacturers of auto parts and accessories who went to display their products.</p>
<p>In the past thirty-four years, this New York Auto Show is not being exhibited during the New Year, but has been changed to being held earlier in the fall. This can be regarded as the first time ever. Since 1901, each auto show has been held in January. The reason why manufacturers moved the date earlier is that they hope to manufacture new models in the fall and receive new car orders in the winter, and then continue manufacturing. In this way, the work of the workers can be extraordinarily even. This is also implemented in accordance with President Roosevelt's wishes.</p>
<p>The nature of the New York Auto Show is national. It is hosted by the Automobile Manufacturers Association. Within this year, in addition to this national exhibition, no other exhibitions will be held. Displays in other cities will be prepared by local dealers. The time will be after this auto show. In addition to the exhibition in the Grand Central Palace, General Motors products are displayed in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Ford also did not participate in the New York Auto Show. All Ford and Lincoln are exhibited separately in the Astor Hotel. Ford's new product this time is considered to be the Ford Zephyr, which has never existed before. This is a V12 car in the mid-price range. In addition to being displayed in the hotel, Ford's Broadway sales office also has a sample car. The Astor Hotel exhibits all Ford Lincoln passenger cars and trucks. There are also Zephyr. The new Ford V8 type car. Large custom-made V12 Lincoln. And various commercial trucks, etc. Each showroom is specially decorated by experts. Famous cars and exquisite rooms truly complement each other. Admission is free of charge. The visiting hours are from 10:00 AM to midnight every day.</p>
<p>General Motors' exhibition venue is in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The entire three floors are occupied. General Motors' various cars, various spare parts, etc., are displayed in detail. Visiting hours are also from 10:00 AM to midnight. Admission is free of charge. General Motors' new cars this time are calling for safety. The three major points in vehicle traffic - cars, drivers, and roads - are all taken care of. A 1936 Buick is used to illustrate the various plans and measures that General Motors has taken for safety. There are also murals used to indicate the progress of highway engineering. Everyone who visits is also given a copy of "We Drivers". In addition to Buick being displayed in the venue. There are also Chevrolet. Pontiac. Oldsmobile. Cadillac. And LaSalle. Fisher Body takes "Gapless Ventilation System" and other features as its slogan. Visitors can also freely try out the car's components. And the host will start the components. For objective purposes. Like "Teng Action" and so on. Are tested and explained in front of the guests.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned General Motors and Ford, many other car factories also use the rest rooms of various hotels as display locations. The escalator entrance to the Grand Central Palace is arranged by display experts using optics to form a "light". Brilliant and pleasing to the eye. Unspeakable. Several auto exhibitions are interspersed in the middle of the large exhibition venue. The four walls of the venue are light green. Interspersed with vermilion and chrome. The colors are very harmonious and pleasing to the eye. The carpet used in the venue is as wide as 60,000 square feet. It can be seen that the venue is not small. Before the opening, someone said. Although the venue is so large. But it has been completely occupied inside. So that later manufacturers have no place to display. The first and second floors are passenger car display areas. The third floor is a commercial truck and spare parts display area.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this exhibition is a very outstanding one. In addition to the 1936 new cars that should be displayed inside, there are also various activities and performances. The operation and use of certain parts of all vehicles, such as spare parts, are active in front of visitors. So that people can understand it at a glance. People in the automotive industry. And leaders of other industries, etc. Are very concerned about the results of this exhibition. They predict that the results of this annual meeting will be satisfactory and impressive. It is expected that due to the fall purchase activity. Both buyers and sellers and workers, etc. Will benefit from it. In addition, Christmas is coming soon. By then, many orders will definitely be sold. It is also said that some people who travel to the south in winter this year. Can drive the latest cars to set off. Also, because the structure of the new car is becoming more and more refined. Although it is cold. The inside of the car is warm like spring. In the past, as soon as winter came. Almost everyone was unwilling to travel outside. They all put their cars on the shelf. Now. At least in this winter season, we can break a lot. Car dealers have now prepared new goods. After selecting a new car at the exhibition. It can be delivered quickly in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The advantages of the various cars displayed at the annual meeting are different. But generally speaking. Style. Comfortable. action. safety. And economy. These points have significant progress. The external changes. The more obvious is the front end of the car. The grille style of the radiator is new. Decorated with chrome. Speaking of safety. Then the 1936 new car can be said to be well deserved. The frame is made with extra precision and firmness. In order to have great resistance. In order to avoid distortion. Also, the size and position of the windshield. Also more spacious and appropriately positioned than before. In this way, the driver's view of the front can be extra clear. The car lights have also been improved several times. Many brands of new cars. Equipped with a new color of light. Can avoid direct glare from the opposite side. Facilitates driving. And increase safety a lot. The driver's comfort has also been taken care of. Not only the position of the driver's seat is increased. For easy turnover. That is, the materials used for the partitions, etc. Are also more particular than before. So that the driver does not feel the heat transmitted by the machine power. Other such as brakes. Are also mostly automatic. For easy use. And its position is also moved to the driver's left. In short, various improvements. It is nothing more than what is confirmed by experience.</p>
<h3>The Cold and Hot Air Equipment of Automobiles</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>A New Field for Air Conditioners</p>
<p>In densely populated areas, dust flies everywhere. Under microscopic examination, this substance is not only dirty and annoying but also a medium for the spread of diseases.</p>
<p>This year marks the 25th anniversary of the invention of air conditioners, and the successful announcement of automobile air conditioners means that the air in the car compartment is fresh, warm in winter, and cool in summer, leaving nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>The first car equipped with cold and hot air equipment was a joint product of the American Hupp Motor Car Corporation and the Carrier Engineering Corporation. The former manufactures automobile parts, and the latter manufactures air conditioners.</p>
<p>A year ago, Hupp installed a regulator in a five-seater car and drove it from Chicago to the Atlantic coast for a summer of testing. It is said that in the areas it traveled, the climate inside and outside the car could be adjusted at will to differ by ten to fifteen degrees, and the humidity in the car was also completely eliminated.</p>
<p>The mechanism utilizes the horsepower of the car's engine to rotate a compressor and a fan, so the electricity cost is only this. Public buses require six horsepower, while passenger cars do not need as much. However, whether there are smaller products has not yet been announced by the company.</p>
<p>The refrigerant used in the device is a gallon of non-toxic and non-explosive substance. It is first cooled by the compressor, then flows through the pipe to cool the air, and then the surrounding heat evaporates it into a gas, which is collected in a storage tank on the roof of the car. Finally, it is transformed into a liquid by the cold air outside and falls back into the compressor. Thus, it goes round and round, fulfilling its duties.</p>
<p>Henri Cochet, the famous French tennis player, likes to be lively and agile. Therefore, he must choose a Ford V8 car for his recent travels to Annam, Hong Kong, and the Philippine Islands. The left picture shows him with his new car.</p>
<h3>Calibration of Automobile Valve Clearance</h3>
<p>— Chen Xing</p>
<p>—Commonly Called "Calibrating Valve Feet"—</p>
<p>If the valve clearance is too small, it will open too early and close too late. If the clearance is too large, it will open too late and close too early. If the intake and exhaust valves open early and close late, or open late and close early, then the intake and exhaust timing will be too long or too short. The intake and exhaust timing of an engine must comply with the design specifications. If there is any impropriety, it will hinder the perfect operation of the engine. Therefore, if the engine's performance is poor and it is found to be caused by abnormal valve clearance, the valve clearance must be strictly calibrated.</p>
<p>Grinding the valves (commonly called grinding valves) to prevent leakage is a very common repair work. However, when the grinding work is completed and the valves are reinstalled, the valve clearance will change and must be recalibrated. Otherwise, the engine will be difficult to operate properly.</p>
<p>If the valve clearance is too large, the engine will make a "tick-tock" noise when it is running. If this happens, it can be determined that the valve clearance needs to be recalibrated.</p>
<p>Valve Clearance The valve clearance varies slightly from car to car depending on the design at the time of manufacture. For example, the Morris Cowley, most engines still need to be calibrated.</p>
<p>Precautions Before Calibration Objects shrink when cold and expand when hot. The valve and valve stem receive the high heat generated by the explosion in the cylinder and expand. Therefore, the valve clearance at this time will be smaller than when the valve and valve stem are not heated. If the valve clearance is calibrated when the engine is cold, then when the engine is running, all parts will be warm and the clearance will feel too small. Therefore, to calibrate the valve clearance, you must first start the engine for a while before proceeding. This is the only way to be accurate.</p>
<p>Valve Clearance The valve clearance varies slightly from car to car depending on the design at the time of manufacture. For example, the Morris Cowley (1932), both the intake and exhaust valves are six thousandths of an inch. Buick (1934) intake and exhaust valves are eight thousandths of an inch. Studebaker and Whippet (1935) intake valves are four thousandths of an inch, and exhaust valves are six thousandths of an inch. Chrysler (1935) intake and exhaust valves are ten thousandths of an inch. Dodge, Auburn, and Terraplane (all 1935) intake valves are six thousandths of an inch, and exhaust valves are eight thousandths of an inch. The maximum is about ten thousandths of an inch, and the minimum is about four thousandths of an inch. However, the exhaust valve clearance is often slightly larger than the intake valve because the exhaust valve opens and closes earlier, and it dissipates less heat than the intake valve. In some cars, the intake and exhaust valve clearances can be equal, but the exhaust valve clearance must not be smaller than the intake valve.</p>
<p>Calibration of Side Valves These valves are installed on the side of the cylinder, arranged in order. The clearance is between the valve lifter (commonly called valve foot) and the valve stem. The upper end of the valve lifter is equipped with adjustment screws and lock screws for fine-tuning. When performing the calibration, the valve cover must be removed. Have another person turn the engine to make the compression stroke in the cylinder, that is, both the intake and exhaust valves are tightly closed. Then use two wrenches of appropriate size to loosen the lock screw first, and then turn the adjusting screw down or up. If a feeler gauge (commonly called a feeler gauge) or card of appropriate thickness is used to test it, it should be able to pass through the valve clearance easily, not loose or tight. Then lock the lock screw back. However, when tightening the lock screw, be sure to hold the adjustment screw steady to prevent it from moving at all, so that the clearance is not accurate. After the valve clearance of one cylinder is calibrated, then continue to turn the engine to calibrate the other one, and calibrate all the valves of all cylinders in the same way.</p>
<p>Calibration of Overhead Valves This type of valve is installed on the cylinder head, suspended upside down. The clearance is between the valve stem and the rocker arm (commonly called crow's beak). The other end of the rocker arm is equipped with adjustment screws and lock screws. When calibrating, you must first remove the valve cover on the cylinder head, turn the engine to make the two valves tightly closed. Then use a wrench of the appropriate size to loosen the lock screw. "Turn the adjustment lock screw to turn it up or down, and test it with a feeler gauge or card in the same way as before. Make sure that the valve clearance of each cylinder is at the appropriate level.</p>
<p>After Calibration After calibration, the engine can be started to test it. The "tick-tock" sound of the engine should disappear. At the same time, its operation must also be better. If at this time there is still doubt whether a certain valve clearance is appropriate, you can also insert a feeler gauge to test it when the engine is running. If you use a card, then of course you cannot do this. When reinstalling the valve cover, pay attention to the fact that the gasket (commonly called bed) must be intact and tightly attached.</p>
<h3>A Travelogue of the Ford Automobile Team to Mexico City</h3>
<p>This year marks the first time that automobile travelers have been able to reach Mexico City directly via the new highway built by the Mexican government. Previously, no one had been able to reach this beautiful Mexican city directly by car from the United States, because there were four hundred miles of impassable roads between Monterrey and Mexico City. There were many mountains along the way, so this new road is indeed a major engineering achievement.</p>
<p>Although this road has not yet been fully completed, many cars have passed through it in recent months. Among them, there was a large motorcade of three Ford V8 cars carrying many members, which departed from Montreal, Canada, to attend the International Lions (or Lions) Conference in Mexico City. This trip to Mexico City took twenty days round trip, covering approximately six thousand five hundred miles. Although the road was often rugged and full of dangers, especially when passing through the mountains, no mechanical difficulties were encountered. However, in Temamatla, Mexico, the only ferry in the river was sunk because it was carrying a bus from New Jersey that was too heavy. As a result, sixty cars, including the Canadian motorcade, were temporarily stopped. Fortunately, an engineer who was responsible for building the modern steel bridge on the Mexico City highway helped solve the problem. He ordered several I-beams to be laid flat on the long logs of the unfinished bridge, with the distance suitable for the car's wheelbase. Thus, each car drove through the grooves of the I-beams and safely arrived on the other side.</p>
