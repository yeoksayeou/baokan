<h3>限制洋米與米穀需給之調節</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>本月七日行政院應上海市府之請特召集財政實業內政三部曁農村復興委員會並上海市府代表開限制洋米入口審查會議於首都以决定適當之辦法會商以後合各方之意見爲三點第一點爲洋米入口所影響現金外流之問題已交財實兩部與救濟工商業案一併研究第二點爲洋米入口應否增加關稅問題已决定視情形如何再行定奪第三點爲碎米入口應否徵收全稅（向徵半稅）問題已交稅則委員會核議决定</p>
<p>我國洋米之進口近年以來日趨增加較之二十年前幾已增加至十倍以上如此大量外糧之輸入一方面固由於海外過剩品傾銷之故而另一方面我國農村之荒蕪與水旱之頻仍自亦爲促成此大量外糧流入之主要原因昨年夏秋之交大旱數月禾稻歉收據上海米豆雜糧公會調查所得浙省除溫台富米之區不計外約計不敷二百萬石蘇省不敷一百萬石他如皖省稍有餘積兩湖大抵無缺江西足堪自給總計長江流域一帶不足大約在三百萬擔左右於是各地糧價紛紛上騰內外米商紛紛定購外糧據各洋行之報吿截至昨年年底止定購數目已達五百餘萬包早已超過不足之數本年以還各米商猶復紛紛定購聞四五月份遠期洋米亦已預定至八九十萬包以上長此以往則去年秋間之「穀貴」行將成爲今年春間之「穀賤」在目前「出賣靑苗」之中國農民旣無所得於去年秋間之「榖貴」復不能不有所損於今年春間之「穀賤」農村前途殊多隱憂影響所及恐於今後中國經濟繁榮之恢復將不免多一重障礙也</p>
<p>行政院在此緊要關頭召集會議圖挽此困難之局自屢切要然而此次會議之結果不過挽救目前之危機恐尙不足以奠未來之基礎繁榮中國經濟必須自復興農村入手此已爲盡人皆知之事理然而農村之復興一方面應研究如何排除桎梏今日農村之根源而减輕農民負擔另一方面則應研究如何增加農民之所獲使得家給人足如此雙方並進農村方可復蘇而工商業亦得隨而向榮矣</p>
<p>夫農民主要收入厥爲耀穀故欲增進農民之所得則至少限度榖價必求與耕作成本相應且須無劇烈之變動但榖價欲求其安定則不能不藉政府之力量而政府尤須有一確定不易之方針換言之今日政府爲求復興農村爲調劑民食應速精密調查全國之米榖消費量然後制定一定之伕律命米穀生產者·米商·米穀倉庫業者隨時申吿米穀之存在量遇必要時更由政府實查以觀需給之比例同時更參照米穀生產費一般生活費及米價指數對物價指數之趨勢以决定最高價格及最低價格若市價低落於最低價格及供過於求時政府爲調節穀價計可以由政府購進米穀或增加洋米稅或限制洋米入口反之可以由政府出賣米穀或减低洋米稅或免除洋米稅如是則米穀之供需可以調節穀價可以無劇烈之變動農民因此而受惠者當不在小而其有助於農村之復興亦决不淺細今日行政院之會議不過爲臨時之性質故其所討論者自以目前之事實爲準據異日境過情遷新事實現象一旦發生則必又再重開第二次之會議如是再而三三而四不獨人力則力爲不經濟而且亦非「一勞永逸」之計故吾人深望政府於此審查會議以後應更求一妥善調節米穀需給之方法以打開今日不景氣之難關也</p>

<p>（東京）日本陸軍部對中東路買賣交涉成交、漏出意見如下、因買賣成交關於該路之俄「滿」糾紛雖可消滅、惟蘇俄若不拋棄其對遠東之野心、勢必更加努力鞏固國境、故非蘇俄具有誠意、該項交涉之成交、對日俄關係之緩和實無多大效果云、（十二日華聯電）</p>

<h3>紐約棉市跌風</h3>
<p>因誤解彭海德修正文所致　政府統制計畫仍把握不定</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約棉市今日在賣風之大壓力下、甚形恐慌、致每包棉價驟跌五元有奇、證券市塲因之而受影響、價跌兩元、芝加哥麥市亦受波及、價跌二分、棉市之所以不寗者、因政府統制新棉產之計畫仍把握不定也、政府决計凡鄉農產棉在二包以下者、不受彭海德棉產限制伕之拘束、此舉亦撼動棉市之信任、蓋以此舉足使限制計畫失其效用也、各方面皆向市塲傾銷大批棉花、參議員彭海德聲稱、棉花限制法之修正文、不能使新棉產總額增至一千零五十萬包以上、渠贊成存積五百萬包不出售於市塲云、此說旣出、跌風暫戢、但猶未能穩定市况也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院農業委員會主席史密斯今日聲稱、渠鑒於紐約棉市價格之狂跌、將在衆院提前政府至少囤積棉花五百五十萬包、直至價格高起與出口貿易復興時始可出售、渠主張政府所存積之棉不得抵賣、亦不得在一九三六年十二月一日以前出售之、如屬必要、渠將提前囤積之數在五百五十萬包以上、此爲國會所能統制之切實目的物、棉業中人今當知國會確欲辦到此舉云、農務局台維四聲稱、棉農公積機關之政策、未有可妨害市塲之處、而政府亦無拋棄棉塲借欵程序之意云、官塲對於今日棉市之跌風、不予以十分之注意、以爲鄕農現縱有棉花出售、亦爲數甚微、故鄕農並不大受其影響也、追究此次跌風之由來、乃棉業中人誤解彭海德棉花修正文所致、蓋修正文主張凡產棉不及二包之鄉農得免繳稅、而政府三月份之規定、則僅適用於地主也、此種修正文能否通過、尙屬疑問、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英眾院大辯論　擴充國防計劃　鮑爾溫以動聽之詞辯護　工黨彈劾案遭多數否決　女子多人散佈主和傳單</h3>
<p>（倫敦）工黨提出彈劾政府之動議、反對政府擴充軍力之政策、致本年淨支出增多一千零五十三萬九千磅、今夜在下院為大多數所打銷、反極黨僅獲七十九票、而不贊成動議者則有四百二十四票、此次引起國際注意之辯論、旁聽者甚多、貴族多人亦坐於特別旁聽席、傾聆辯論、至為注意、法比土大使及德使署參贊亦在其內、當舌戰正烈之時、忽來出入意外之穿插、有女子多人、從旁聽席擲下和平主張之傳單、紙片紛飛、散佈會場、此輩且大聲痛詆國防白皮書、當即為院警所挾出、未幾旁聽席中復有女子數人、作同樣之趣劇、亦被逐出、同時有眾二百、多係女子、集於議院外室擬進見議員、以便反對政府政策、幸禁備森嚴、未發生事變、辯論聲中亦非無接攘聲浪、工黨阿特里動議彈劾政府、指白皮書否認國聯、毀棄國聯基本主義、使國聯不能發生效力、並指白皮書引起軍備競爭、使世人羣相惶駭、當動議人發言之際、政府黨議員大呼「胡說」以應之、此次所辯論者、、爲一部軍費預算估計、與從前議員所提出者不同、且此預算估計、第一次付討論、故今夜辯論尤爲人所注意、</p>
<p>工黨彈劾斥為廢話</p>
<p>彈劾案請下院表示意見、政府國防政策是否與（一）創設國聯以植立集合的世界和平之精神完全相反、（二）妨害軍縮公約成立之氣象、（三）導成國際之競爭與不安全、並釀成戰爭、隨特里聲稱、當外相西門正準備對德國作友好談話時、政府竟發表國防白皮書、致犯德國之怒、此乃可憾之事、政府似從未贊同他國之軍縮計畫、任何國內任何形式之　武舉動、工黨輒厭惡之、白皮書顯然表示英國之完全改變、而復入於歐戰前聯盟對敵及天空軍備競爭之空氣中云、政府黨大聲斥之曰、「廢話」</p>

<p>樞密大臣鮑爾溫起立答覆、詞甚動人、謂民治政府已在白皮書中說明其所認爲民治眞理之事項、從前常有因民治政府之領袖未揭示人所不樂聞之眞象、致發生不利於民治之絕大危機、頃所言英政府對於國聯僅有口惠一節、實屬非是、英國任何政革之政治家、自國聯成立以來、輒隨時於非常困難之狀况及現已出會諸國之反對下、竭其所能、擁護國聯、英政府現仍决定在國聯中爲前途工作、但人有在高談集會的安全與制裁時易忘懷者、卽國聯會員未普通化、故集合制度並不完全是也、兩大國現已通吿出會、而予集合制度以重大之打擊、此外尙有一大國、始終未擔任國聯之義務、英政府亟盼國聯普通化、因此理由、歡迎蘇俄之加入國聯、並自己始終努力擬勸德國撤銷出會通吿、須知國際政治中之問題、不爲作其理想中最好之事、但爲作現有環境中最好之事、政府現未提議擴大軍力、不過進行去夏業已辯論之空軍擴張耳、其所請求者、爲其所有之武力一旦須與侵略者相抗、或須履行公約下義務時、應在可能範圍中設備完善而已云、</p>
<p>白皮書非對德而發</p>
<p>鮑爾溫言及倫敦英伕談話後發表之共同公報、謂公報中所言與德國直接及有效的合作一層、在英法政府觀之、有特殊重要關係、乃有西門往游柏林之佈置、大約半月內柏林之游、當可實現、各方面在此種事件中、各有其欲爲者、有願修改現行條約之國家、亦有被請對此修改予以同意之國家、前者如欲稍稍變更現狀、無人可責備之、但何者亦可作合理之要求、卽其所欲有之變更、應隨爲和平安全所必要之保障以保來是已、若干方面以爲白皮書僅指德國而言、此說不確、惟白皮書所言者、在實質上卽渠去年十一月得一般同意而發之言論也、此種言論、出以友好精神、及眞率諒解、乃任何談判最好與唯一有效的前奏之信任、苟不坦白眞率、則有效的協定之造端、且不可能、更無論乎結局、渠希望政府現可認眞辦事、</p>
<p>法意談判闢新時代</p>
<p>巴黎與羅馬業已開始之談判、如繼續在他國都城爲之、而謂其不能造成歐洲之新時代、則實無此理由也、英政府顧此談判繼續進行、並準備有所頁獻、但創造或擴大虛偽的事項之志願、或查能握住事實之努力、則胥不能有何補益也云、</p>
<p>充實軍備祇求平等</p>
<p>鮑爾溫答辯英國國防計畫將導成他國重整軍備之說、並指陳他國如美日俄等軍備業已大增之事實與數目、謂美國現已建造軍艦、以達條約所許之限度、而英國則猶未也、美因海軍預算、由一九三三年三五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元增至一九三五年四九二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、而一九三六年則所增尤多、共達五八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、觀此數字、可見縱在條約束縛之下、英國現已覺其所有武力未能使英國獲有平等矣、鮑爾溫繼言及伕意海軍、謂他國雖以驚人速度建造各種戰具、但英國並未增多海陸軍備、如關於戰艦之新協定、不能成立、則英國戰艦之補充、不久將成緊要問題、英戰艦在許多方面需有最新設備、及防備飛機之保護、此種設備、美日二國刻已迅速爲之矣、英國陸軍未有大規模戰事行動之充分準備、而英國空軍仍居世界空軍國之第五位、英國雖在今日、猶不欲與最大空軍國抗衡、僅欲保持其與距離稍近的强國獲取同等之地位而已、</p>
<p>空軍公約旨在保安</p>
<p>今日所有之許多觖望、起於地位問題、英國在將來討論時、必須注意此事、許多國家今且採行一旦戰事發生全國皆兵之大計劃、英國從未作重整軍備之先導、英國所有空軍、仍居第五位、除抵制飛機之國防設備外、並未增加其海陸軍力也、英國不能保障自己之遭天空襲擊、但可使天空襲擊較爲困難、此卽提交之天空公約之志趣也、無論如何、必須使在歐洲任何地方之天空襲擊爲無價値、白皮書中所陳說之政策、不獨無害於和平、且可使將來之和平更爲穩固、吾人必須一致盼望吾人代表之於今後二三星期中前往歐陸都城者、工作順利、而使吾人奮鬥以求之安全、早日實現云、</p>
<p>西門繼言結束辯論</p>
<p>一部份自由黨議員之領袖薩繆爾聲稱、英政府現開始軍備競爭、除破產與戰爭外、競爭將無底止云、外相西門起而結束辯論、謂渠得政府完全同意而聲明者、英國政策、全以國聯會員爲根據、英國不欲恢復從前集合制度未成立時所有之方法、目前談判之最要旨趣、在謀取德國可復入國聯之條件、吾人確信世界保障未有可與直正而普及的國聯之有效的工作相頡頏者云、前外相奧斯丁張伯綸乃提出其修正答案、其文曰、「下院忠守英國爲聯會員之義務、並願以國際妥協吿成軍備之限制、而承認此項目的不能以片面的軍縮達到了、今贊同政府之政策、認爲在保衛人民與履行國際義務上有同等之必要、</p>
<p>明白應付侵略國家</p>
<p>前外相謂國聯對於偶起之戰爭、固能予人以絕大之保障、但對於故意作戰以連其野心的國家之侵略、則未有擔保、此種戰爭、欲阻止之、唯有向此侵略國明日表示將以絕大武力應付之、使之不能有勝利希望而已、洛迦諾條約東歐公約及其他地方恊定、皆以此爲政策、而成鞏固集合制度之有效的方伕、</p>
<p>白皮書內容之一斑</p>
<p>至於白皮書內容、下院責任所在、宣昭告國人、白皮書所需要之犧牲、乃爲英國國防及履行國聯會員國義務所必要者云、英國之防預算估計之重要數字如下、空軍在一九三八年底以前增四十一支隊半、經費增三〇八九〇〇〇鎊、共二〇、六五〇〇〇〇鎊、</p>
<p>陸軍增多二七〇〇人、共一五二二〇〇人、經費較上年增三九五〇〇〇〇鎊、共四三、五〇〇〇〇〇〇鎊、</p>
<p>海軍經費較上年增多三五〇〇、〇〇〇鎊、其六〇〇五〇〇〇〇鎊、增人員二千人、其造艦程序爲巡艦三艘、領導艦一艘、驅逐艦八艘、潛艇三艘、潛艇供應艦一艘、供應艦四艘、測量艦一艘、與小軍艦七艘、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>雅典　維尼瑞洛夫婦率軍官六十人聞已於今日在意島加索斯之杜特根尼斯登岸、其坐艦卽駛回希臘、準備歸降政府、維氏今年已七十一歲、爲希臘共和國之「國父」、曾統一全國、擴張國土、然仍不免於亡命他國也、政府對於維尼瑞洛資產豐富之夫人、將取何種行動、尙未宣示、惟稱、已查悉維夫人曾資助革命、並爲叛軍購買軍火云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>雅典　政府頃向保加利亞政府要求引渡各叛逆軍官、據特德伽區城悄息、叛軍一營擬乘火車逃亡、當被解除武裝、此外塞萊斯叛軍指揮官拉那諾斯託波拉斯旅長偕參謀人員五名、乘一裝有摩託之帆船逃亡無踪、不管部閣員梅達克薩斯答復新聞記者云、外國苟出而調處亂事、在希臘政府視之、實爲非友誼之舉動、各國亦無出而調處者、所見正與希臘政府相同、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>市長報告　吳市長報吿略謂今天是紀念總理逝世的一天、同時又是植樹節、我們每年都是這樣舉行着、總理偉大的人格、大無畏的精神、爲國家爲民族創造了偉大的革命事業、這是我們的萬世的永久的典型、吾們在紀念這樣一個偉大的人物的時候、當然應常有一種很具體而切於實際的運動、來表現我們眞誠的紀念的心理、所謂植樹節、就是要去推行造林的一種運動、造林實是全國經濟的一種基本建設、因爲森林與我們的國計民生、有很密切的關係、我們在生活上的需要、衣食住行、沒有樣不是直接和森林發生關係、我們要復興中國農村、要使中國的經濟建設有基礎、要使中國人民在生活上的需要品的供給、不感困難、那就不能忽視這造林運動、所以我們在紀念總理逝世的一天、還舉行植樹典禮、因爲這樣總理的偉大、才可繼續不斷的、千秋萬世的、不使我們民族所忽視、今天的總理逝世十週年紀念、我們在每年的紀念中、覺得他的意義都有不同、總理的偉大的人格、偉大的事業、不但是做我們中華民族萬世的典型同時他一生困苦艱難、爲國家爲民族去奮鬥、與滿淸專制君主和軍閥政客的抗爭、經過了數十年的時間、雖是有十餘次的失敗、但是他還是繼續不斷的努力、直到他臨死最後的一刻、喊着「和平」「奪鬥」「救中、國」的遺言、這是我們負責建設國家責任的人能够一刻不忘這種精神、那就一定能成就、在這過去的十年中、我們未死的同志和全國同胞、對於總理經過四十餘年的奮鬥、而未竟的事業、是不是能够繼承着他的精神、完成其事業、實現其主義、這是我們應當加以反省的、我們環顧目前的環境、國家和民族的命運的危急、不能不使我們驚心弔膽的、所以我們應當下着這樣的一個决心、要把一天的工作做了十天的事情、十天的工作、做了一月的事情、一月的工作、做了一年的事情、一年的工作、做了十年的事情、我們本着苦幹直幹硬幹的精神、迎頭追上去、這樣不論在個人的事業、乃至國家社會的事業、都可成就、我們祗有認淸、總理偉大的人格、大無畏的精神、爲民族爲國家奮鬥的精神、做我們救亡圖存的工作、</p>
<p>童吳演說　繼由童行白演說略謂、今天是總理逝世十週年紀念日、同時我們又舉行植樹典禮、關於植樹的意義、吳市長已經詳爲報吿、兄弟不再多講、兄弟想趁這個機會、還把總理逝世紀念和植樹的關係、提出來和大家說一說、我們在總理逝世紀念的一天爲什麼有這樣兩種舉動關於我們在這天、把總理的主義和他的事業來宣揚、並且鼓勵我們來繼承他的精神、完成他的事業、這是關於精神方面的紀念、此外我們在這一天舉行植樹、每年都舉行着、到了二三十年乃至二三百年、可說全國的森林、都是爲紀念着總理逝世而有的了、這是關於物質方而紀念的表現、我們在此、可以發生兩種感想、第一、樹木有「及時奮興」的美德、樹木之生長、發育繁榮、這是大自然的昭示、我們人類也要有這樣「及時奮興」的美德、現在中國已經到了萬分危險、國際關係、又非常險惡的時期、在國內民生的痛苦、也是危急萬分、現在樹木是及時奮興了、我們應當也大家努力、及時興奮、去做民族、救國家、第二樹木决沒有無用的、不論大小粗細、各有其用、這也昭示了我們、我們是國民的一份子、對於國家社會、都應當盡一份責任、做成一個有用的人物、如果我們人類中間有不能自立、那末、比樹木還不及了、所以我們在這紀念的日子、應當切實的來檢閱自己把我們所有的能力、來貢獻給國家和民族呢、末由市社會局局長吳醒亞演說、略謂、我們今天在紀念總理逝世、我們不禁就回憶了當總理臨終的時候、還發着「和年」「奮鬥」「救中國」的呼聲、我們覺得和平和奮鬥、是本着中國固有王道的精神、而救中國、也就是救全世界、因爲以中國的地位、不但在東亞是一個重心、在全世界也是負着極大的使命、中國不能富强、從遠東而擴展至全世界、都歸入大同了、所以我們對於這七個字、實在不容一刻或忘呢</p>

<h3>由豆餅中　提取酪素試驗成功</h3>
<p>王樹衡發明</p>
<p>滬江大學化學系四年級生王樹衡君、鑒於酪素爲各種工業之重要原料、近年來爲用尤廣、各國每年之消耗量、殊足驚人、酪素之來源、皆自牛乳中提取、所得量極低、有人發明從黃豆中提取、所得量遠超於牛乳、今王君更從豆餅中提取、所得量竟倍於黃豆、經長時間之研究試騐、始吿成功、實爲我國實業界之一大貢獻也、茲將王君所述、錄之於後、酪素爲蛋白質之一、英文名詞爲Casein、牛乳中平均在百份之二·五—三·五、世界各國至今日止、酪素之提取、胥賴於此、在近三十年來、酪素在工業上之爲用日廣、其製取事業之地位、亦日見重要、是以牛乳產量不足之國家、必須向國外輸入酪素、例如德國年由美法運入大量之酪素、每年之消耗量約在一五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅左右、美國在一九一八年、僅製八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅、在一九二七年、增至一八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅、至一九二八年後、由國外輸入二八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅之鉅、酪素之消耗量、旣日見據大、而牛乳中之含量又若是之小、因之有尋求新泉源供給之必要、而我國聞名於世界之主要出品、—黃豆—、實爲供給此新泉湧源之理想物品、有人曾試騐提取、最高量可得百份之十七、較之牛乳、巳勝過六倍、但鄙人（王君自稱）顧及黃豆一經提取之後、祇可用作肥料、而不可再行榨油、如能於豆餅中提取、則成本可减低數倍、因即着手研究、經長時間之試騐、結果非但豆餅中含有酪素、且所含之量甚高、每磅豆餅、可得一百六十餘格蘭姆、換言之、所得量佔百份之三十六左右、「酷素在工業上之製造伕」、酪素在牛乳中之製法極多、但大規模之製造法、不外下列三種、（一）用酸類之沉澱法、（二）用凝固酵素（Rennet）之凝結法、（三）自身變酸凝結伕、此外更有電解法、但此法在電極之選取上極感因難、至今猶在實騐室研究時代、工業上尙未開始應用、鄙人將以上三法、均作多次之試驗、第一法經改變之後、成績甚佳、「動物性酪素與植物性酪素之比較」、酪素爲無味無臭之白色體、其組成原素之百份比如下、　　　　　　　　　　　酪素為含燐蛋白質｜其分子量在一一三五左右、爲複鹽基之弱酸應成酸與中和監、在稀鹽基溶液中、及向極光下（Polarized　Light）、有左旋作用、稍溶於水、極易溶於苛性曹達及濃酸、不溶於酒精及以脫、若溶於强鹽酸中、生美麗之紫色、以上係牛乳中之動物性酪素之通性、鄙人將豆餅中提出之植物性酪素作定量之分析、與市上所售之動物性酪素相比較、　　（即自牛乳中提出者）、大體不相上下、其溶化性與化學作用、亦相類似、酪素在工業上之應用、（一）各種膠黏物質（Glurd）、特別包·鑲·塗·蓋·膠黏物質、（Venneer　Glue）人造之堅硬鑲料、（Compact）如電木、（Bakelite，Golallth）及人造角質物等、（Horn）（三）照相軟片、（四）化裝品）、（五）肥皂、（六）紙、（七）人造絲、（八）人造皮、（九）壁紙、（十）油漆、（十一）藥品、（十二）食品、（十三）隔電器、（十四）支鞋油、（十五）按摩膏、（十六）礦油凝結劑、（十七）防水布、（十八）除蟲粉、（十九）印染業、（二十）精煉酒類、由此可知酪素實爲我國有希望新工業之一、以我國今日黃豆之重要地位而言、此項工業、實有使其發展之必要、</p>

<h3>中日經濟提携之商榷　（六續）</h3>
<p>— 穆藕初</p>
<p>五大根本原則爲：</p>
<p>（一）消極的不得以經濟一提携」或調整之美名暗行以强大御弱小的統制經濟之實際。，同時積極的應以平等互惠的報償主義爲原則。</p>
<p>（二）消極的不得利用經濟調整之名，而行對中國的政治運動，或中國以外之國家的政治運動之手段；同時積極的應發抓經濟的互利性及經營技術乃是至生產技術的互助性。</p>
<p>（三）消極的不得包含任何現令形式之借欵及信用設定，幷上述輸出入貨價差額借欵：同時積極的應在中日經濟調整上所發生之新合議或合辦的經濟或金融組織中，中日雙方能完全樅利平等，機會平等。</p>
<p>（四）消極的不得以所謂「排日」或「排日貨」（其實是國貨運動）之絕滅與中日經濟調整聯關幷論；同時積極的應由日方尊重中方之國貨獎勵運動。</p>
<p>（五）消極的不得宣傳中國今日經濟界之簫條，係由於排斥日貨，同時應認中日經濟調整，只係中日雙方救濟各自的國難之一種方法。</p>
<p>這兩前提與五原則，雖不是中日經濟調整的條件之全部，但可說是最低的要求。日方如能奉行，則中日經濟調整之前途是有光明的。然而我們一聽到，日本所高唱的大亞細亞集團經濟，就不禁提心吊胆。換一句話說，如果在日本領導之下；實行中日「滿」的集團經濟，便不能不加以慎審的注意。且這個集團經濟，就是要使中國和偽組織同樣的受日本支配，我們可以從日本許多言論中，看出日本此種的野心。而且在現在複雜的國際情勢之下，日本爲着打開牠的生路，爲着凖備第二次世界大戰，都正急迫地需要組成大亞細亞集團經濟。假如我們不明此點，從附和中日經濟調整的空言，無異自願加入日本的中日「滿」集團經濟，而受日本肆意支配。我們並非反對中日經濟調整，要是中日經濟調整，確於中國的國計生民有益，我們贊成之不暇，否則，决非我們所敢贊成了。我們認爲中日經濟調整問題是一個極嚴重而非可忽略的政治問題，而且是關係中國存亡的重大問題，因此在這裏　以至誠曉起全國人士對此問題切實研究和注意！</p>

<p>上海美術專科學校副校長王濟遠氏、此次赴菲舉行中國現代書畫展覽會、業已完畢、於日前偕赴菲觀光團同時返滬、上海社記者昨特往訪王氏於寓所、據該書展經過及菲地藝術情形如下、展覽經過王氏談此次赴菲舉辦展覽、目的在溝通中菲文化敦駕友邦交誼、並籍此籌欵建築美專新校舍、携帶作品共計書畫三百件、於上月十三日在馬尼剌東方俱樂部及中華靑年會兩處舉行、開慕之日各國領事親來參加典禮頗爲隆重、參觀者亦擁擠異常、原定至十八閉幕、旋應各界要求延期至二十三日閉幕、售去書畫約二百件、餘件由華僑敎育會代爲管理、</p>
<p>菲地藝術　菲律濱係最近百年來文化才有進步、故其藝術頗爲幼稚、對中國藝術以過去在菲缺乏宣傳、故認識頗少、對書法及淡墨水書、以其色彩簡單而售價甚貴、幾發生疑問、此可概見、其對西洋畫亦甚幼稚、作風係十七世紀、尙由西班牙人傳來之歐洲色彩、故新與藝術、中國亦較菲站在前面也、在若對於中國書畫用之紙墨筆硯亦難覔得、民間室內裝飾物品、大都用放大照片加以鏡框、以資懸掛、並無書畫之類、故此次阻菲舉行展覽之後、巳給菲人以深刻印象、</p>
<p>菲大美院　菲律濱大學美術學院、爲菲地研究藝術之最高學府、建勢規模頗爲宏大、院長力拉魯梭爲菲地著名聲家、該校研究西畫、並無中畫、華人亦有二三入校讀書、惟以家長在菲係經營商業、故研究者爲商業應用美術、雕刻圖案等類、余會參觀該校、男女校特兒均要衣服、可見其思想之落伍、惟音樂歌舞戲劇等尙稱發達、</p>
<p>交換圖畫　菲大美術學院院長曾以一幕色」西畫一幀、與王濟遠氏之「江山野雨圖」交換、由菲大校長布高伯主持交換禮、此爲中菲文化交換之起點、該畫現存菲大圖書館、拉氏之畫存上海美專、菲大並擬酌派學生來華研究東方文化、此次展覽後對中國畫之總評爲「花為代表中國四季、士女代表中國歷代民族裝飾、山水代表中國民族思想高超、而中國畫之由上掛下即高超之表示」云、</p>

<h3>洋米售價無升望</h3>
<p>九江有小絞去化內地去胃又減退</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、內地去化又减、而囤戶以銀根關係、多願隨市脫乎、因此高次各檔、一律趨軟、比之前市又小三五分不等、且存底充實、來源不絕、後市仍在看小中、惟昨日本街略活、九江帮亦有小絞米一千三百包交易、因此市又疲定、全市開出現洋米九千多包、客秈一百包、客元五十包、期洋米二百噸、</p>
<h3>洋莊芝蔴做開二百噸</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊芝蔴做開二百噸、價爲九元原盤、　英商買進、刻下進胃尙活、前途頗居穩局、黃豈各路銷塲雖有、但胃力薄弱、市氣未能激轉、所以昨日行情續小二三分、計開歸德荳千餘包、一行情請看市價欄、」蚌埠荳二車、亳州荳一車、頴州荳一車、碭山荳三百包、漢口乍荳八百餘包、</p>
<h3>絲茶　華絲商趕快謀改革</h3>
<p>—出口絲不堪問聞—</p>
<p>邇來絲市洋裝、用戶皆寂然無神、海外來賬、若白廠B字等級者、只吃價四百二十元、廠商因本重無肯售者、印度粗絲市塲、因受日貨打擊亦困於苦境、故開春以來、對外輸出、甚爲慘淡、據某出口行華經理云、我國絲業界營業手腕、似應隨時變換、不然、世界市場上、將無見華緯立足之地、至繅工之精良與否、無足論矣、</p>
<h3>五金　大條青鉛到旺銷呆</h3>
<p>大條靑鉛、近來市勢萎靡靴振、蓋新茶雖將上市、無如今庚銀根孔急、况茶棧去年洋莊銷路不振、因之結果不佳、是以對茶商放欵不肯貪做、故今庚需辦不多、而油漆公司·黃丹廠·及鑄字作等、均因上次購買太多、此時殊無力幕再進、全市因出路太呆、市氣甚軟、惟到貨湧旺、故積存奇豐、標準由十四元三四角跌至十四元、而現欵購辦及遠期拋貨行情則尙可低廉一二角不等、聞連日開出祇有二三百條而巳、其購進者爲大津客帮及屯溪茶帮耳、據業中人云、苟茶帮生意如不發達、則今庚鉛市希望、恐難起色、至湖南土鉛、亦以洋鉛銷路呆滯而帶落、刻市祇售十三元三四角、查成交亦祇四五十條、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油漢市續漲</h3>
<p>白桐油自前週飛漲後、形勢愈趨穩固、漢口售　行加至每擔三十五元四角洋規、迨至上週始　定勢、入本週後、市面又起漲風、據前昨兩日漢電所報、洋行已辦至三十六元以上、且此等高價、自改用洋本位以來所無、實最近三四年來所僅見也、據漢行存底極薄、故駐漢各洋行欲辦多　、殊頗不易、近日漢行開進客貨、亦已漸次加　、襄桐已做至二十九元左右、南支且在二十九元以上均客規、蓋客冬襄桐因年令關係、度數稍低、故售盤反較南支爲廉、亦市塲上之變遷也、浙桐亦隨漢市而漲、聞杭市足度已加至三三十三元之外、本埠洋行去路雖無大宗交易、然零星如三十五十噸、尙時有所聞、因滬上出口全賴浙桐、而浙省所產、實不足以供偌大洋銷、所以本埠徑營出口貿易之號家、均不敢預拋多數也、</p>

<h3>糧食　晴春利於麥苗發育　遠期粉麥最弱</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈一致鬆跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌五六角之巨、坎拿大跌八分左右、當開價時、以洋麥報價、又兼前日聞廠家曾續訂澳麥一船、價四元七角、雖本月份因現粉依然奇俏、惟人心則大部分虛疲、尤以遠期人心、更覺不振、故上午結果、近小一分、遠小二分、迨至下午開盤、因業內外心思，均不看佳、遠期因有內地帮鑒麥苗甚佳、頗有拋售、市面又呈頹落不堪、是以本月份市氣、亦爲之帶疲、照目下之情形、如無特殊之變化、又看鬆動之象矣、結果本月份跌二分、四五月份跌四分二厘半、六月份跌四分、七月份跌三分七厘半、八月份跌四分半、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份一致呈鬆落之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌五六角左右、坎拿大跌八分、當開價後、近期交易、仍然淸淡、遠期各月份、則因洋麥旣跌、國內各產麥區域、以天時甚佳、發育良好、故人心一鬆、價亦驎落、下午各盤、交易尙暢、價則與上午相仿、結果本月份跌六分、四月份跌七分、七八月份跌八分、現麥市面、因廠胃仍佳、客戶扳售、價仍平定、開山東麥三元七角七分、頴州瑤灣麥三元七角六七分、</p>

<h3>中次白粳獨好一角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到二十五六號（貨共四千餘石、）銷塲先呆後動、故市色亦初疲後平、結果終以久疲之下、尙難扯平、若各厚粳價續貶五分、而晚稻雖包胃如煙台威海衛等情忽辦千來包、行情亦見步第數分、至近角、杜洋尖無市、陰變元供求相仿、仍定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船落稀、約十餘號、市上各貨銷路平常、白粳中次者因貨稀、致價轉昂一角零、薄稻平市價小數分午市轉定、其餘各貨亦短定、惟白元去胃零星價修五六分、</p>

<h3>關於行動主義文學</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>從恩得列，瑪路洛（Andre　Malrone）獲得了襲果爾獎金以來，行動主義的文學遂獲得了全世界論坦的注目，而作為該文學之化的代表作「人間的條件」（La　Condition　Humaine）亦成為讀書界的寵兒了；這本書的價値，曾有人喻之為尼米以來的唯一刺潑的創作。</p>
<p>行動主義文學之抬頭於今日的文坦，是種極佳的全世界知識階級之動向的速影，尤其產生於純藝術。蕩漾藝術的薰香味之法國文坦上，更令人感到與味。</p>
<p>因着第一次世界大戰的結果，法蘭西的知識階級遭受到不可療愈的精神的打擊，因此在戰役的法蘭西，支配知識階級的東西，是絕望的氣分，懷愛神秘的怪奇的非現實的心理，這種意識形態隨着戰後法郎貨幣安定下的相對的繁榮，而繼續地維持着。</p>
<p>到了最近因看世界恐慌的加厲，法國一般的中問層，都深感到生活的陷於沈壑，這種「生活苦」使每個人從絕望的沼地裏跳出來，自尋生路，像恩得列紀得，費爾那德斯等，都是很顯明的事實。</p>
<p>一般的知識階級，在這種境遇裏，遂拋棄了ＺLibralism，而開始作行動主義的提倡與運動，所謂這行動主義者，乃是主張以積極肯定的態度，來代巷消極否定的熊度，不單單觀照而重視行動，進一步說，行動主義就是主張行動是全生命的溢盈之處的哲學。</p>
<p>這種行動主義，是持有一定的界限的，這限界也可以說是基礎，是建築在貝爾格遜（Bergson　Henria）的哲學上的，這話或許是過甚其辭，但祗少這行動主義的確與具爾格遜的哲學持有連繫的關係。所謂貝爾格遜的哲學即是「生命的哲學」，他說「眞實在」絕對不反復，而是無限地創迭變化着的生命的不斷之流。然而思唯是把這流動無巳的具體的實在抽象起來，而成為固定的東西；所謂物質也不過是生命之流的固定而已；物心二元可以由意識的一元而統一之，所以成為他思想的核心，是生命的飛躍（Elan　Vital）之觀念。這種哲學的錯誤，是非常顯明的事情；因此靠着這哲學為準繩的法國行動主義文學的確不能够完全地請算了過去的破壞主義，盲目主義和野獸主義等。</p>
<p>行動主義是常常地被誤解了的，不，是常被利用而作為粉飾自己的墮落的；法國的行動主義，雖然還未臻完善，但祗少是知識階級想從懷疑的自棄的狀態裏救出自己，而奪鬥所得的貴重的產品；但這種行動主義，常常到了一部分人的手裏，把他作為知識階級的萬能論了；因為知識階級是個中間層，所以很多人極力地强調所謂知識階級的「特質」能動性，這能動性是可以這樣地理解的，卽是「任意而為」與站在「誘掖的立塲」，「任意而為」的話，雖然是有稍稍的限定，即限定於沿着歷史的正當的方向，但這是自圓其辭，仍舊是往昔的Liberalism，至於「誘掖的立塲」，說得顯明點，就是站在指導的立塲，這種借行動主義的招脾，而想確立知識階級的萬能地位，簡直是把行動主議給被滅支離了。</p>
<p>所謂眞實的行動主義，我在上面說過是以積極肯定的態度來代替消極否定的熊度，不但這樣，而且必須揚棄貝爾格遜氏的「命的哲學」，建立在正確的世界觀上；雖然現在的一切現實情况，非常複雜和不自由，但追求矛盾之點的規道是全相類似的，所以人類之赴趨相互的社會批判，我相信也是可能的，在這塲合裏必須充分地認淸了退行的歷史之動向，向一個社會的動與進步，隨着知識階級的步步邁行而呈新的姿態。反撰加於自身的重壓，而更能獲得了求眞理的實踐的行動性。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們再談行動主議的文學吧！所謂行動主義的文學，簡單地即可稱之謂充滿行動主義精神的文學。環繞於作者週身的不安，和現實的各種苦痛的形象，這並不是對於作家，僅僅作為思考的材料，而是可作為作家給整理分折實踐的材料。思得列，瑪路洛在某演講會裏，曾說了如下的話：「如果作家是個有心的技師的話；我們絕不能忘了技師最高的機能是發明的這件事，藝術不是服從，藝術是征服者。」同時他在他的處女作「征服者」裏簡直把自己比作征服者，在這種思想裏，我們可以窺到促進藝術的更佳的發展，並在此中，充分地表示了使自己接近社會的現實之情熱，與自己的藝術的主張。</p>
<p>行動主議文學，不含有極機械的政治意義，但也不是波格達諾夫的文化主義。把作者孤立於現實之外的熊度，給撕破拋棄，而澈身地去體騐現實，不是僅僅體騐，而是以知識階級豐富的知識，去作分折解剖的工作，我們相信以知識階級卓越的能力，加之其趨於實踐的經騐，則這種對於一切眞理的奮鬥的成就，的確是大有可觀的；而持着這種行動主義的精神著作家，對於一切形象的表現而產生的創作，也必然地能如實的反映了現實，而且有進步的素質的。</p>
<h3>江南公園</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>江南公園的得名，因為園址依着松花江的南岸的，對江北岸是吉林省城三道碼頭一帶地方。</p>
<p>江南公園不收門票，是它的唯一特徵，讓我想一想，恐怕東北各處的公園，都是不收門票的吧？只有這樣，才是眞正的「公一園，才是名符其實的「公」園；不然，用巡捕看起園門，非票莫入的「公」園，其實該是「私」園了。</p>
<p>到江南公園的路徑，是從三道碼頭上船，這棅船專用以作江南江北擺渡用的，但不是南方的舢板，而另名之為「小威虎」，長條的，兩端不是方頭而是尖尖的。打一個譬喻，把一條細長的胡瓜從正中間分成兩瓣，剝去瓜中的瓣，就是一條「小威虎」的縮影。</p>
<p>園門北向，下了船就可以望得見了，但是園門上的匾額可不是「江南公園」。這裏本是農事試騐塲的改裝啊，這塊老牌區還沒有塗掉。</p>
<p>園門一帶，有些賣零食的擔子，棚子，甜瓜，汽水，茶水是大宗，香烟，糖球自然也少不掉。茶館裏還有「話匣子」，這東西有時張開大口亂喊一陣，有時又傳出千嬌百媚的女腔，很能够吸引一些遊客的脚步。</p>
<p>進園後，照一般人的慣例，順着柳蔭道往東走，但是依我說還是徑西去的好，朝西轉南，穿過些菓樹，你可以看到些野獸；這邊還有籃球塲，有雙槓，運動健將，武術高手都可以施展一下自己的絕技的。兩排古屋中，吐露着濃重的霉濕氣，你或許要引起一番不勝蒼老之感的感慨。</p>
<p>這回再轉到東面，就到了兩層樓大廳的前面，這是農事試騐塲塲長辦公的地方，如果你和塲長相識，你打算在園內宴請親朋故友的話，這大廳是可以借用一用的，而且不需化錢，只是這裏沒有飯館，沒有茶食店，這些吃喝東西一定要和人一同帶過江南來才行。樓房的窗子和柳浪相齊，眺目遠望，南面是平鋪的野田，後面蜿蜓着一重重的山蠻；東面仙人洞那裏是一帶矮崗，但崗後還是擁出一重重的高山；松花江從西南流過來，折轉東北去，和山崗相映，襯以蔚藍的天空，你的目光會引起一些快感的。</p>
<p>出農事試騐塲的東門，門外北面是一個小花塢，如果說你是來逛公園的，倒不如說是來逛花塢的好。一進花塢，有一個水池子，裏面飄着一層荷葉。池外，是一方方的花池。花池後面還有一長排半築在地面下的花房，房頂全舖着圾璃，是冬天藏花的地方。</p>
<p>在花塢裏，舉目所看，盡是各色各式的花朶，眞艷麗極了。香氣在空中飄散着，蜂蝶在花叢中飛舞，人處在這種情形下，還有不感受自然之美的麼。</p>
<p>兩座茅亭，在花叢中屹立着，破敗，傾斜，比一比爭妍的花叢，多麼不相襯和！長春籐從亭畔各處順着繫上棚頂的繩子爬着，一直爬到亭頂，把亭中洞穿的風，常常給遮走了。</p>
<p>亭後有一片楊林，林外是沙灘，紅綠掩映，再襯以閃射的江水，倒是滿有趣的景色。</p>
<p>出花塢再東行，是林木區，從那些名牌上看，你可以知道什麼呌德國槐，什麽叫美國楊一些樹木，我寗願在林下漫步，不願在花塢中賞花，艷麗噴香的花朶，總不如雄偉孤高的林區好。</p>
<p>走到這裏，全個園子己經讓你走完了，該回城了，再往東走幾步，你可以從小東門對岸的波口過江回城了。</p>
<h3>登荊山</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>在懷遠，荊山塗山是有點名的，塗山據說更荒凉，旣然荒凉，但是荒凉的地方也得去玩一次呢！在中國，荒凉的地方荒禿的山，到處都是呵！我想找另一個機會，也去看看荒凉的塗山。</p>
<p>那天，遊荊山，我們一起四個兒，從懷遠的街市走去，沒多少路，就到山麓下了。</p>
<p>雖是陰沉天，然而我們登山的心境是晴天的。</p>
<p>在山腰上我們尋到了山泉，泉作乳白色，泉上鑿有「乳泉」兩紅字的一塊石，字雋勁有力，上面沒年份可考，亦沒書者姓名。泉旁的一方空地上，樹蔭下，一個古香色的道人在一個爐灶邊扇開水，水就是乳泉，他每天把泉上的乳白色的水，一竹筒一竹筒地舀起來煮茶；道人的生命是有限的，他也能舀乾這乳泉嗎？</p>
<p>登山腰上望淮樓，樓的建築並沒一點雅緻處，裝着破破落落的玻璃窗，不中不西的，說它像什麽呢！眞說不起來，樓內置茶几椅子，臥榻，壁上滿掛着一條條楹聯，當時把他一一唸過一遍，回來，走在半路就背不出，像記得某一聯下半有「蘇子來遊」，考志書，宋代那位詼諧成性的蘇東坡也去遊過的。荊山還是當年的荊山，然而我們的詩人早化為塵土了呵！一點小小的戚慨來碰我的心了。</p>
<p>望淮樓，顧名思義，就吿訴你登樓望淮水是最好了，樓前有短欄，你凭着欄杆，把目光向遠處送去，淮水的千里波光，水上帆檣林立着，小汽船的汽笛聲，悠悠地從風裏飄來，在這情景裏，你不能不贊美山河的壯觀了。</p>
<p>我望着淮水的下游，我望那迢遠無際的天涯，望斷天涯，望不見江南的故鄉呵！被一些烟雲似的傷感撞到心上來了，我突然地憶起杜工部的斷句來了。</p>
<p>—海內風塵諸弟隔</p>
<p>天涯涕泗一身遙！</p>
<p>山上道人把乳泉所煎的茶送上來，茶芳香淸澄，只是我們是不懂品茗的俗子，在忽忙的生活中，也有「雅人」的心境嗎？</p>
<p>薄暮的雲靄濛上天際，我們沒有上高峯的勇氣了。</p>
<p>一九三五，二，二三，于懷遠。</p>
<h3>奴性憎惡者（續二）</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>「我說過，她可以一天不講話，小女兒又整天到街上去玩要，而我那時候對女人說話學得非常低聲和氣，所以屋子裏聽得見鷄底笑聲，却沒有人底聲音的。唉，要不是我腿上長了那個毒瘡，現在我也許會對婆娘們尊敬一點的吧！」他嘆了口氣，跟住就晤暗計算着日數，繼續說。。「我那個瘡一直潰爛了五個月，一點不能走動，錢都用完了。我底第二個老婆和女兒，正正跟她們開頭來的時候一樣，垃圾箱裏面的菜葉似的臉孔上，長着許多憂慮的皺紋。我常常拍着床板叫她安心：「那算什麽呢！……大家都沒法子再動一動的時候，都躺到床上來好了。」……</p>
<p>「終於有一天，我喊破了喉隴，她們也不來看我一看，而且永遠不來了……」</p>
<p>他那揸着筷子的乎，舉到半空中，像一下子不能放下來似的在空間抖顫着。灰暗的眼睛，充滿了殘酷的冷光；憤怒逼着老人——他那一個瘋子似的眼睛釘住牆上的什麽地方，兩條手臂張開着，慢慢地可怕地把臃腫的身子抬起來，喉嚨裏滾出一些老人家常有的不淸楚的嘿嘿聲。這個動作繼續了不久，他又給誰打了一下似地突然坐下去，然後像平常一樣平靜地，毫無感情地笑起來了。</p>
<p>我臨走的時候，遞一個銅板在他手裏，叫他給我一把蔥。他順手把銅板放在口袋裏，拿起鍋子，用筷子頭撥好風爐裏面差不多要熄了的炭，然後又深深地喝了一口酒，並且咂着舌頭唧唧地響，表示對燒酒的讀賞。</p>
<p>但我出了門口走上幾步，那老頭子突然在後大聲嚷着：</p>
<p>「喂，錢呢？買蔥的錢還沒有給我。」他底腐蝕了的記憶力把收過錢那件事完全忘記了，着急地向我招手。我走到更遠的地方，還隱約聽見他在沉吟地咒駡着……（完）</p>
<h3>摸彩</h3>
<h3>翰林進士都是不通的寶貝（二）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>何以科甲中人，從來沒有半個通古書的呢？理由很簡單：若是通了古書，便沒有入科甲的希望。如論語：『子曰；當仁，不讓於師。』孔註；『當行仁之事，不復讓於師；言行仁急。』從此讀論語的人，只能把「師」解作「先生」。北宋有一士子應試，用漢人舊註，解作「當仁不讓於衆」，其義較勝，却因此落了第。如又論語：『君子恥其言而過其行』句，朱註；『恥者，不敢靄之意；過者，欲有餘之辭。』明明是望文生義，胡說八道。情代有一士子，依皇本高麗本校改「而」為」之」字之誤，却也因之落第。你看讀古書，若眞要求其通，對於掇取科甲有多麼大的危險；讀通了古書，一輩子就不必希望做科甲中人了罷！幼年時，父師敎我讀四書，只准看朱註，不准看情人的考證。有一次，我看了何晏的論語註，用以推翻朱子的註解還挨了先父一個大栗子呢！直到現在我才明白他們是希望我不要讀通古書免得麻煩的，還是一番好意呢！這樣「前人撤屁，後人說香」的讀古書法，請問；如何能够讀得通？卽算仲尼復生，也只好做個笨伯了罷？</p>
<p>有人以為狀元總是天上的文曲星，有十斗八斗的天才；大槪他是從唱本上從戲臺上看來的。按之實際，殿試前五名，（俗稱狀元探花之類）其名次早决定於靠山的夾袋中；（故事，凡有鼎甲希望的都給朝中貴人們拉去做門生）。文章好壞，全沒有關係。殿試文章，題目有一定範圍，字數也為皇上的御題所限，絕不容「草茅新進」發揮任何意見。在殿試卷子中，抬頭的高低，諱忌的字眼，比文章好壞，重要得多；六百名中的狀元，我們從沒見過傳世的鴻文；不獨沒有傳世鴻文，他自己後來若眞研究學問，能寫一點文章，未私不看了自己的殿試卷而作三日嘔的—狀元之不通如此。</p>
<p>狀元之類以下，如舉人進士翰林等等，其「不通古書」，「文章不通」，更不待說了。前人說：「塲中莫論文。」塲中之文，以字體正訛，格式舛合為衡文標準，與文章本身的好壞全無關係。淸初古文家姜宸英，名重一時，魏叔子許為「在醇肆之間」可是幾次與試，以遠科塲格式，屢次被斥，後來試於禮部，復違格；主者莫其名為之更正，方成進士。這還是康熙帝有意成全，方能成就功名，否則還不是終老書生嗎？自舉以下，什麼秀才貢生，正是：</p>
<p>「三句承題，兩句破題，擺尾搖頭，便是聖門高弟，可知道三通四中是何等文章，漢祖唐宗是那朝皇帝？案頭放高頭講章，店裏買新科利器．讀得來肩背高低，口角噓欷，甘蔗渣兒嚼了又嚼，有何滋味？辜負光陰，白白昏迷一世　就敎他騙得高官，也是百姓朝廷的晦氣。」——徐靈胎：徊溪道情更不必講什麽看通古書文章了。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>現在是科學文明的世界，事事物物　有標準的發明：如標準美人，標準香烟，標準時刻等等，據說是巳盡科學化的能事。不過，所感缺憾而科學不能補救的，就是人心還沒有標準的發明！</p>
<p>凡事須忍耐」的一句語，我以爲是有分別的：凡事屬細小沒有計較價值的，忍之可也：凡事關重大而有計較價值的，不可忍也。不過，在我交涉力量不很充足，預料得不到勝利時，也得暫忍，準備實力以乘機爭勝：並不是說事無大小，一概付之忍耐而不計較啊。</p>
<p>硯心原不是黑的，只因近晨的緣故，就連帶黑起來了！所謂：「近朱者赤，近墨者墨。」一不留心，就要濡染。我們在社會上做人，也要以此爲鑒，防着五顏六色的誘惑才好！</p>
<h3>夢話</h3>
<p>— 花病鶴</p>
<p>我時常抱着幻想，假定能够像「南柯記」裏的淳于棼，做上一回槐安國王的駙馬，和南柯郡的太守，窮小子好吐一口骯髒氣了；雖然是一塲春夢，然而世上舉凡一切，何嘗不能作如是觀</p>
<p>「聊齋誌」鳳陽士人一篇，記述一箇奇夢，大可當得一杯療妬羹；和名伶苟慧生排演的妬婦訣，可謂各有千秋。</p>
<p>江淹夢筆生花，給後人做了恭維話的俗套：不知國委邵元冲先生，也曾經夢見一枝梃大的筆，放出花來，醒來很覺詫異，跑去告訴他的夫人張默君女士，不料默君也做上同樣的夢：後來考試院舉行第一屆考試時候，元冲和戴季陶同被委爲主考官，元冲爲紀念佳夢起見，特榜其書齋呌做「同夢筆生花館」，這可算得黨國稗史中的一段佳話了。</p>
<p>情人久別，一旦夢見情人，當然喜歡得了不得，可是醒來，却又懊喪得甚麼似的；我最愛近人襲劍虹和老丹記夢詩說：「夢裏逢歡夢亦歡，逢歡不易夢歡難，君如再作逢歡夢，切莫將他作夢看。」說得多麼透徹而輕鬆，眞是此中人的一帖無上淸凉劑。</p>
<h3>南通小掌故</h3>
<p>— 蕪心</p>
<p>離南通不到幾十里的長江裏，有一個「白胃沙」，每天到日落之後，便漲了出來，和沙灘一般，航船無法前進，要到天亮了，這沙降落下去之後，才可以繼續前進。長江輸船在上海啟椗的時間，一定要等到夜深十一二點鐘，就是要避免夜間經過這裏的緣故。據說許多國內國外的水利專家，對它都沒有辦法。天下之奇，眞是意料不到的。</p>
<p>張季直先生是竭力捧梅蘭芳的，因此在南通名勝之區的狠山山麓，建築了一所梅宅」，以爲迎梅蒞通安息之所。從前這「梅宅」離開江面有一二十里，現在已經緊靠着江邊了，所以預料這「梅宅」在一二年之內，勢必坍入江心，「梅宅」前面廣植着的許多梅樹，已經搬去，滄海桑田，變遷得眞快呢!</p>
<p>在明朝時候，倭人時時入寇，嘉靖三十六年，竟以數萬之衆，圍攻南通,當時有一個名呌曹頂的，率領五百人，和倭人血戰，斬獲甚多，但是結果卒因衆寡懸殊被殺。現值這國難嚴重的當兒，爲激發國人民族精神起見，地方人士，已在建築曹公祠了。</p>
<h3>奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 梅徑豁</p>
<p>在閘北某一處冷僻的瓦礫塲中，無意中給我發現了這個奇蹟。</p>
<p>一簇二三十間簡陋的小屋子，遠望去，煞如一堆田野間遮蔽棺柩的浮形坑一樣，不到六尺高，一個兩尺光景的小洞，便是進出唯一的門口，這些建築物（？）的材料，完全是滬戰時被日軍砲火轟炸燼餘的房屋的斷垣殘壁，和幾片被人們拋棄了的生了銹的鉛皮。</p>
<p>當我踏入了這個陰濕，骯髒的區域，嗅器管機裏，便有一股異乎尋常的臭味冲進，同時有幾個鳩形鵠面的腦袋，從洞中伸出來，用着深陷在眼眶裏懷疑的目光瞧着我，一霎時，便縮回去。我爲好奇心所慫恿，便俯着身子，向每個洞裏探視，像尋覓奇蹟似的。啊！難道這是紅丸窠嗎？每間中有着一條破蓆，上面放着小燈扞子，小盒，和一些零星的東西，吸食者大都是這些鶉衣百結，蓬頭垢面的乞丐。其中尙有一個二十歲左右的女乞丐，據伊自己說：曾經在某女校肄業，因爲染上了紅丸癮，給家庭驅逐出來，淪落到這裏。不錯，伊有着蛇也似的身子，突出的臀部，可是並不肉感，脚上還套着一雙半新舊的高跟鞋，像摩登女一樣，不穿襪。談話時，還揷入幾句咬音準確的英語。這在我看來，不能說不是一個奇蹟啊。</p>

<p>月英坐在那裏，不能久沉住臉，讓買多才賞鑒，便站起來道：媽呀！我們可以去了嗎？朱胡氏聽說賈多才今天可以先給幾個錢，兩眼是被桌子角上那堆銀元吸收住了，不時的向那裏偷看着。因爲眼睛被那銀元吸收住了，這條身子也就不想走開，只望賈多才抓一把洋錢遞了過來。可是賈多才口說了，並不動手，自己又不好意思走，只好是在這裏　坐着老等。現在月英說要走，自己可不肯起身，向他道：忙啥呀？好多話還沒說哩。月英　了眉道：還有什麼話沒說？我想我們也不便說，又說不好，換舅母來說吧？朱胡氏一想，自己不好意思開口要錢，換嫂子來要也好，於是手扶了椅子，慢慢的站起，向賈多才道：賈老爺，我們回去？賈多才微笑着，在那堆銀元上取了五塊錢在手，送到朱明氏面前，桌沿上一疊子放了，笑道：你們老實人，我不能騙你，這錢先送給你，就是事情不成，也不要緊，我是不在乎的。朱胡氏哦哦的答應了一陣，半蹲着身子向賈多才作了個按胸襟的安福揖。眉開眼笑，望了他，正待道謝。賈多才搖手道：不用不用。到今天我才知道你的姑娘是會說話的。即是會說話的，那就很好，我留他在這裏坐一會子，談兩句心，也好知道他是不是眞願意？這總沒有什麼不可以吧？朱胡氏一來覺得這沒有什麼不可以，　二來得了人家這五塊錢，這一點兒小事，那裏還好意思駁了人家。於是點頭道：這沒有啥要緊，只怕他不好意思說吧？便又想坐了下來。（一五五）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>或者可說，這也是太后的一福氣，幸而上天並不曾給予伊一種未卜先知的技能，否則要是預先知道了幾十年後，會有溥儀這個不成材的東西，給日本人挾到東三省去唱出這樣無恥的巴戲來，伊必然早就氣死了。其實在那個時候，溥儀根本還不曾出世，休說太后不會想到他會當日本人的傀儡：便是那三年的實統皇帝的稱號，伊也尙未料想到咧！</p>
<p>進了頤和園，一切含有歷史性的悲哀的氣味，便一起和伊隔斷了，因爲這園是新蓋的，尙不曾有什麼傷心的陳蹟留下咧！而伊所愛着的各種花卉、正在滿園盛放着，尤足排除伊胸中所有的種種愁緒。再加從西山上吹下來的那一陣陣的和煦的微風，度遍了園內的各處，格外的使人戚覺到舒適暢快。不錯，這裏乃是伊的老家：又是伊的退隱的安樂窩。在伊的暮年中，虧得有這樣好的一個所在，供伊怡養，不然是伊所過的日子，更不能有什麼歡樂了！最有益於伊的是這園裏終年充滿着三種特有的景象：一是華麗，二是平靜，三是知足。假若伊能看破一切，把所有的政權依舊歸還給光緒的話，伊的生活中便常有這三種安樂的景象了：可惜伊竟不能，於是伊也只得在政務比較閑暇的日子，到園內來領略一會暫時的安靜和知足的景象。但論到華麗的一點，却全給伊佔住了：本來，凡要擺在皇太后眼前的束西，還會有什麼不華麗的嗎？（二六六）</p>

<h3>日本奇觀—裸體祭神</h3>
<p>裸體祭神」，這件禮儀，在日人心日中也認爲天下之奇觀。考他的由來，很像我國蒙滿風俗中的一打鬼」，所以說不定是由我國古時流傳過去的。</p>
<p>「追儺一就是我國的「打鬼」從前是日本宮中舉行的禮節。「大儺」即大鬼，頭上戴着四眼的黃金假而具，黑衣紅裳，左手握楯右手持戈。舉行的時候，陰陽官朗讀祭文之後，四處發出小鬼的呌聲，於是大鬼用楯和戈從宮裏把小鬼驅逐出來。祈禱國家平安，國民幸福。在精神上，惡鬼驅逐之後，人人的罪惡可以解除了。</p>
<p>這種　禮節自上古流傳到現在已有千餘年的歷史，現在各地神社都已廢除，獨有國府言神灶尙有古風。但是現在舉行的禮節，已與從前宮中所謂追　」的，形式不同一裸祭一體舉行共有一星期，最盛的是陰歴正月十三日。社會喧傳，從前日人很注重裸祭，都　了禮裝禮服，齋戒沐浴，四處來參加的很多，以冀消滅罪惡。後來漸漸的隨便，在祭祀這天，非常混雜。在天明年間，裸體的風俗，是尊嚴的神事。據現在有關煞的男子，都要裸了身體，去「麼肩」之後，才可消滅罪　，延年益壽。</p>
<p>日人舊俗，凡是二十五歲和四十三歲是關煞年。到陰歷正月二日便要到神社裏去報到，並用抽籤法選出年男」一人。在「裏祭」前七日，住在打鬼殿內齋宿。正月十二日神官用二三升粉做成一塊很大的圓形年糕祭神。十三日朝晨就有數百的裸體男子在齊塲—聚集。午後三時裸祭開始，各人要到打鬼殿裏去用肩頭　着一年男」的肩頭，再在殿內巡迴的互相用肩頭磨擦。這樣皮膚生熱，水氣上騰，好像迷霧一樣。遠近來觀禮的有萬餘人之多，其奇趣非筆墨所可形容。</p>
<p>十四日，「年男」將大年糕背至「小富士山」的土坵上，掘個小穴埋了。再唸了幾天佛，「裸祭」於是吿終。還有備前西大寺的觀音殿，也有「裸祭」。從京阪四國九洲來的人有十萬餘。禮節略有不同，在十四日晚八時舉行。並且在午前二時，西大寺的僧正在窗裏投去兩塊寳木，那個拾獲了，稱爲「福男」，於是一羣裸體的男子，又亙相搶奪起來了。</p>

<p>暹羅王自從與國會爭權失敗，便卽宣佈遜位，在倫敦過其「暹僑」的寓公生活。在其侄阿南大「代天承命」登極之後，一般朝野人仕，沒有我們的「社會」博士觀見溥儀時那樣眷懷帝日的「耿耿此心」，所以未曾聽見對暹王今後的生活，能如黃帝子孫秉承忠恕之道，給以年俸五百萬元。所以這前此稱孤盤谷富有全國的暹羅王，現在隻身遠遯，托足異國，倒使人有「故國不堪回首」之想。</p>
<p>但是這一想像，竟是過慮。也許不能像滿淸帝室有如意珠龍眼珠等價值連城的「古物」可賣，可是二十世紀這時代可以使他聰明，他能在倦勤」之後，每年領到四萬元美金的失業保險金。因爲巴黎電稱：暹王前曾鑑於世界各國君王失位者頗多，於數年前向英法保險公司投保失業險一百萬美金，在阿南大繼位時，業已向保險公司領取賠欵。以後每年將凈獲美金四萬元，以至盡其天年云。</p>
<p>一個人到了南面稱王，叭我獨尊時，自然就養成一稻「朕卽國家」的心理，加以「普天之下莫非王土，率土之濱莫非王臣」的情形，確在誰也想「一世萬世而爲君」。享不盡榮華富貴，穿不盡錦繡綾羅，吃不盡玉粒金波，何曾有這樣的人，輕輕便便的便願意將「一統江山」讓給他人？要給，除非你殺掉了自己。因此要一個皇帝「失業」，實在是罕見而不容易的事。</p>
<h3>茶市</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>「小茶葉……社凟……橋上……來………」老人洞上在報茶葉行了；萬源和祥泰這幾家山貨行門口，都已貼上了「早晚市價不同，目下一言爲定」的招紙，來趕早集的鄉人，走過行門口，一顆心己比往日輕鬆了許多；於是大家不約而同的圍了上去、有的去問行主人打聽茶葉行情，有的站在傍邊看招紙。瞧着「本行小茶葉定明日開秤」的通吿，嚥了一口唾沫，把肚子裏的饑餓頓時去了幾分，漸漸地在每一對沒有神的眼睛裏放出那期望的光燄來。</p>
<p>鎮夏港裏收靑頭的東山船，一條一條的擠着：幾位面團團的山貨行主人的胖臉上，都露出了一絲得意的微笑。尤其是萬元山，幌着那個大腦袋，一搖一擺的把一雙細小的眼睛幾乎閩成了兩條縫，嘻着嘴巴，在向行門口的「徘園戶打話：</p>
<p>「嗨！今年春冷，出貨恐怕還不多啦！」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？茶樹上還只有茅芽子呢，說不定要戴了眼鏡才找得出幾頭茶葉來哩！」蟹夾四搶上去說。</p>
<p>「不過現在人家等錢用，沒飯吃，就是最細些也要採採看的，祇要行裏關</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>秤……」歪頭金賓說得很有見地。</p>
<p>「是囉！蟹夾四，你今年的茶葉做手應該注意些，不要像去年一樣，不是太潮，就燥得成了末子。」</p>
<p>「是呀！山老闆，今年總要我自己來上鑊纔好，她們女人的手嫩怕痛，所以倒底是不行；不過今年的市面可起色些不？」蟹夾四本來為打聽行情而來的。</p>
<p>「這話也難說；你看吃了清明飯還沒有幾個茶葉客人來過。」萬元山撇了撇八字短鬚，有經騐的回答。</p>
<p>「大概二角進關是不見得的吧，去年還有二角多一兩呢！開頭我三角一兩都賣過的。」</p>
<p>蟹夾四離開了行門口，看看茶館裏酒店裏，人都已走光，就是歪頭金賓，吊殺銀龍也回去吃飯了。於是他也把一只潮烟袋掛在臂灣裏了走回家去。</p>
<p>他想，去年賤做賤總算還有二角出另，要是今年及不上去年的話，那真可要教鄉下人去吃河水了。從前一季茶葉是小出息，養蠶本錢都要照它牌頭的；養蠶才是大巴望，五月到八月的生活開銷全要靠在它身上，一個「荒春三苦八月，」如果沒有這兩季出息，鄉下人不知怎樣才能够過去？可是如今養蠶是已經不好上話場子，那這季小出息使算我們唯一的救命王菩薩。然而近年以來，茶葉洋莊不通，東洋人，俄羅斯人，他們也會種茶葉了，真是說不定將來這碗飯也要給人家奪去啦！</p>
<p>蟹夾四一路走一路想，走到了家裏看看門也銷着，知道老婆已吃了飯到山上去採茶葉了；一個鑰匙却寒暑在一個墻洞內，這個秘密所在只有他和她兩個人知道，別人是不曉得的。他開開鑊蓋來，看見今天燒的是豆粥，也沒法就吃了兩大碗，到山上去和老婆一起採茶葉。</p>
<p>今年長春三，所以茶葉發芽也遲，現在茶樹上的芽頭真還不過像米般大，要採一兩青頭也要採得眼花，一兩乾頭該要三兩青頭，他們兩人從早採到黑，勉强湊成了一鑊，秤秤四兩乾頭還不到。</p>
<p>第二天清晨，蟹夾四帶了一小包茶葉上茶市場去，一看人倒不少，不過全是些小園戶，上半斤的戶頭還沒有，祥泰行門口人也擠得水洩不通，街上比平日熱鬧了許多。</p>
<p>他走進了萬源行裏，却見萬元山正忙得喘不過氣的在稱茶葉。</p>
<p>「這茶葉太烏，只能够一角半一兩！」</p>
<p>「啊！這火頭太旺了，已經焦了頭，二兩四錢三角半。」</p>
<p>「咦！這里白片太多，四兩半，除包紙五錢五角大洋。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>他一包一包的看下去，不是說太潮，定是說太燥，幾乎沒有一支好的；「山老闆加一些！」的聲音他似乎不曾聽得，撩開一包又去秤第二包了：「賣便賣，不賣便吧！」</p>
<p>「今年價錢真的遠不如去年嗎？」蟹夾四有些不相信「不會吧！」</p>

<h3>方與圓</h3>
<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>在東亞的大陸上，我們這古老的國度里，一向是被認為「病夫」的，這美名的獲得，自然不是最近的事，也自然是有他相當的因素存在其間的。雖則在現在，因了關心者的急呼，大體上比較着有了些成績，能使人得着稍許的注意，可是，到底因為牠的潛伏力太大了，想要挽救這既成的聲名，也絕不是最短的時間可以辦得到的。</p>
<p>最近本市小學生結核菌試騐，當牠的結果和我們見面的時候，不能不發生着一種感慨，雖說參加的只有五校，但由統計上看來，染肺病者竟在百分之七十以上，這一點，是值得注意的。</p>
<p>兒童，是怒發的苗子，假使在「怒發」的時候，不好好的加以培植，那末，他的成長一定是很危險的，說不定也許會中途滅亡。</p>
<p>所以，我們認為除了「自療」以外，除了做家長者應該確實的注意以外，兒童療養院的設置，實在是切要之圖！</p>
<p>「年來社會經濟殊不景氣」，這話無論在報端或是人的口頭上，總可以常常地聽到的，而聽到以後怎麼樣呢？有些是「不言不語」，有些「報以淺笑」，還有些是「感慨系之」。雖說這些在實際上都不會發生什末效果，然而除掉這，又讓他們有什末辦法呢？</p>
<p>「社會圈」裏的人在這氣氛下呌了，跳了，甚至哭了，圈外的人，却還在笑着，舒適蒙住了他們的心，彷彿那個鋒利的圈子與他是不會發生關連一樣。然而，不懂人事的嬰兒，雖則圈裏和圈外都沒有他的份，可是他也不能逃出了這圈子的網羅，忍受氣氛的洗鍊。這，只恨生的年頭不好，別無話說。</p>
<p>於是，甫出娘胎的嬰兒，忍痛的送往「育嬰堂」，忍痛的讓別人去「領養」，忍能的隔絕了雙方面的情份。</p>
<p>在社會中心為男性佔有的現代，一般人的眼光裏，「男重」的觀念總是不能免除的。於是，在從前育嬰堂里的嬰兒，常常地在十數日就能被人領去，現在呢？因了氣氛的高潮竟至「無人過問」感覺到「人滿之患」。於此，不得不吁一口長氣而私忖曰；「年來社會經濟殊不景氣也。」</p>
<h3>浪人散記</h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>響午的時候，船在三道口的小渡頭邊停下了。船家繋了纜，艙裏邊的客人便開始亂起來啦：男人携着包裹與提籃，娘們牽着孩子，魚串兒般地走到船頭上，走到跳板上，走到岸上，走到乾燥的小路上—那兒，也許存在着窩一般的老家，也許有溫暖的友情，也許燃燒着火一般的難以抗拒戀意……於是，一串的人，在不同境遇下面生活着的人，—有了退了伍的老兵士，有走江湖的打着「以武會友」的旗子的賣解的中年漢子，有在上海大公館裏做當差的，有搖着響鈴在街上擺着「善觀氣色」的攤子的，也有忘掉了「家」這個名詞的流浪人—便在不同的目的下面走向不同的路去了。</p>
<p>船家在船頭的甲板上躺了下來，甲板上，鋪了一片的旺太陽，數着收集攏來的船錢，把二吊做一包；然而，辛苦地搖了一趟水，也只有二十吊光景呀，這年頭樣樣生意不興旺，賣力氣過日子的可真有吃不飽了。</p>
<p>想一想，嘆一口氣；一種恐懼，又像陰天的霧那麼地，在五千開外的額上的皺紋中游移起來了。—咳，這是什麼日子呢？</p>
<p>坐起身裝了一管子潮烟抽着，岸上是靜靜的，水裏也沒有多大的波紋，一串少年的心思便菜花那麼地帶着金黃色的姿態任記憶的園子裏開起了。那時候，沒有磨折，沒有憂慮，生活的本身是幽靜得像春日的池水，夏夜的，與秋天麥穗。</p>
<p>已經是很遠很遠的日子了。</p>
<p>爹是一個黑黑的結實的漢子，可是却十分老實的，三句話說不過人家，臉上的青筋便全急得漲起來了，然而人家是不敢同他鬥嘴的，他沒有驚人的嘴；可是却有結實的拳頭。帶着女人，把船當作家，便那麼一個碼頭又一個碼頭地闖出去了。</p>
<p>我愛水，我愛大海——我喜歡看大海中的兇惡的波浪，與浮在水平綫的盡頭火盤一般的太陽。我是流浪地生長在水鄉的嗎。</p>
<p>於是長大起來了。可也不缺少一個强壯的年青人的身體呢。幫着伙計搖檐，大半天不呌一聲疲乏的。</p>
<p>老年人誇耀地端詳着我的黑色的大眸子，說：好傢伙，真是生長在水鄉的，流浪的種子呢。於是便：用着老水手的狂放，拍着我的寬闊的肩膀：「喝，我說，小傢伙，應該找一個年青的俏娘兒來做伴兒了啊。」</p>
<p>老年的一代漸漸地衰弱下來，退落下來了，跟着老年人的青春一同地，這平靜的日子也將永永地過去而不會再來的了。自己用了有力的手臂把船隻（是流浪的，飄泊的家啊）從老年人手裏接下來的時候，舊的時代已經現脫去了一層殻；而新的流浪便也在這當兒開始了。</p>
<p>於是：一漿又一漿，一埠又一埠，一條河又一條河，一年又一年，在人底勞力已經成為拍賣場裏的商品的時候，便那麼不知不覺地一天天的浪過去了。</p>
<p>——水鄉是我們的生長地，水鄉是我們的墓穴，我們是先天的流浪人啊。</p>
<p>正午了，伙計搬出了飯，在熱騰騰的稻香中，岸上有人在喊：</p>
<p>——喂，來船啊！</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>急忙放出了笑臉去應接，想：明天的午夜的夢又不知將失落在那處了。</p>
<h3>春到人間</h3>
<p>— 緬懷</p>
<p>春終於粉飾了這個灰附的世界。</p>
<p>寫字間的窗是南向的，帶着宿酒未醒似的倦眼，把明媚的春光消磨在阿拉伯數字中：雖然那彷彿慈母之愛般的陽光很早就撫　着我的寫字檯，但是使我更感到人生的疲憊。春天，是蓬勃的季節：草木回春、蟄虫蠕動，隨輕風飄揚着的大減價的旗幟，也掩飾了全世界汎濫着的不景氣狂潮。卽使再沒志氣的人類，打起了一年之計在於春的信條，似若努力地想多做一些事；但是這一層玻璃窗之隔，在我看來，隔着一個星球一般地遙遠啊！</p>
<p>年靑人是不應該生這種想頭的！那末大的聲音在我耳畔雷鳴起來。眞的嗎？就那樣在懷疑之中給我好友打了個電話。我說：「春天了，禮拜天到我家里來，我們來玩一些學生時代的把戲，什麼都好，要把這個日子最滿意地打發過去。」</p>
<p>在期待着的淸晨，我起了個早，揩窗掃地，見太陽溫柔地溜進夫井的時候，我歡躍起來，並不是她粉飾了這個灰暗的世界，是這世界自然的光明。</p>
<p>接過了送來的當天報紙獨坐狹小的天井中，面對着東方，彷彿在閱報室中搶奪似的翻開了附張一塊塊廣告都在跳動，每個鉛字變了「春天到了」！那末着把報紙扔在墻角里，顧應着朋友沒有更變在學校里的晏起習慣；計算着如何把這太陽滿意地打發到西山去。注視時鐘，爲時尙早，知道等候一個快樂日子的來臨應該故意做一些不願做的事，等到突如其來降臨的時候，那要十百倍的有意思。</p>
<p>就歸到臥房整理我的書桌，報章，雜誌，杏仁精，阿斯匹靈，用最有樣的次序排列起來，拂去了照像架上的灰塵，不自知地打着口哨的時侯我的朋友推門進來。但是意外的我沒有戚到十百倍的有意思，他卸了長衣、坐定之後急忙地抽起烟來。</p>
<p>半嚮，他說被行里呌去幹了一些不應該今天幹的事，記惦着你的約會，想草草完工却被外國人監督着，以下的話用嘆氣來結束了。</p>
<p>這小小的打擊還沒有把我們的興緻全部壓　下去。午餐後，商議打發這日子的一覽表了，總覺得學生時代玩過的把戲現在想來是太無聊了。而有聊的事呢？誰的腦袋里都沒有藏着這個念頭？</p>
<p>把太陽打回西山我們沒有離開臥室一步，記得談起許多老同學，某離家遠行了，某失業了，某夫婦不睦……而奇怪的我們的生活正是某某等最大的希望。我向窗外望去，那一層玻璃外面的太陽，漸漸地離了我的視綫之外了。</p>

<h3>一九三五年式汽車之新發展</h3>
<p>— 欽譯</p>
<p>此文載於汽車工業第七十二卷第二期。是美國之一汽車工程專家赫爾脫（P．M．Heldt）所著。對於新車改進的地方。闡發無遺。因譯之如左。</p>
<p>普通到紐約汽車展覽會中參觀過的人。總以爲在過去的一年中汽車設計上已有了很大的變更了。其實這變更祇是在表面上。而內部在車轅蓋下和車身底下的一切。還是和去年的差不多。除了一件事。就是重量的重新分配以增進行駛的平穩。但是其中也有許多細瑣的改進的地方。</p>
<p>過去工程部的最大的氣力都是費在鋼片的工作上。來提高他們的銷路的需求。因此「流綫形」就差不多成了大家的口頭禪。其中最重要而且也是最普遍的一種改革。就是把預備的車輸藏進車身的末部。這樣可以使車身漸近於眞正的流綫形。屏風翼和後鑲板都比以前的傾側車翅和其他突出的部份也都在形式上大有改進。使牠們的空氣阻力减至於最小限度。</p>
<p>差不多有許多的汽車設計者都以爲若汽車的形狀眞近於理論上的流綫形的話。那麼車身就有大鼻之譏。這在顧客方面當然不會歡迎的。因此他們就想出這樣的方法來。僅把汽車上各部份分別的流綫形化。使牠們的形狀最適合也是最有吸引力對於水箱柵格和車轅蓋的合併。與車翅也須相配。然後把各部份連接起來。用鋼片外罩做成飛機上翼板的流綫形。</p>
<p>這裏無論在汽車工業界中的人或是使用汽車的大衆。都不免對於單獨的前彈簧有極大的好奇心。不知道美國的汽車家將怎樣地在他們第一年的試騐之後來使這單獨前彈簧的制度實現出來。假使一個汽車製造廠對於次一年的製造節目有一個標準。那麼他一定能夠使他的試騐滿意。去年採用這個制度的幾個廠家。今年大致還是沒有更動。此外更有新添入的兩家也採用這制度。同時也有些廠家不用這制度。或則就因爲牠的價格較貴的緣故。</p>
<p>大家也知道單獨前彈簧如裝在美國的車上的。在製造上價格確是比較貴些。買客方而大都有一種很深的影像。就是現在市面上有兩種不同的汽車。牠們的價格不同。其中價格較貴的是備有單獨的前彈簧。而其他則沒有。</p>
<p>在單獨前彈簧尙沒有完全發展的時候。又有一種變更在去年開始起來。可以增進駕駛的舒適。這就是車上動力機部份之移前。同增加前彈簧的活動範圍。從前水箱總是置於前軸的上面。動力機再在後一些使其地位可以放低而不妨礙於前軸。今年動力機大都是移前了六吋至八吋之間。這不特可以减少震盪。鬧聲。並且因爲車中的座位也同時移前了離開了後軸的關係。可以使乘客不致受到後輸所傳出的震動。這樣更可以使車身之後部便於流綫形化。同時又可以使後面的預備車輸隱藏到車身裏去。</p>
<p>動力機也比去年的來得馬力大。這是因了增加了吸氣的容量和壓力的比率的綠故。並不是賴於增加活塞的排氣量。我們可以設法使壓力的比率一天大如一天。但是仍不使引擎有爆裂之虞。凡是生鐵所鑄的汽缸頭其壓力比率可以至六·五甚至六·七元數。不過自從我們採用了鋁製的以後。在近幾年來已發覺其比率太大了。近來對於燃燒室的改良。雖也可以使馬力增進。但若沒有燃料上的反爆裂性的改良。恐怕不會有迅速的發展。至於裝靜熱器於氣管中來調節熱量。對於增加馬力上助益也不少。</p>
<p>此外更有一點就是火星的管理在增加壓力比率上有很大問題。在比率十分高的地方。我們大概用入油管的眞空來管理火星。當引擎因負荷重走得慢的時候。火星是非常延遲。防止高壓時的一切影饗。如爆炸等情。</p>
<p>平均標準的壓力比率用在運客車上的。在去年是從五·七二至五九四。</p>
<p>因爲要使壓力比率增加的緣故。於是壓緊室的容量就不得不縮小。而對於汽門旁的間隙就發生了困難。特別是那種L形汽缸頭的引擎。在過去的一年有不少研究的工夫費在這上面。使壓緊室得有相宜的式樣。不妨礙氣體的流行。我們已經知道在高遠度的時候。排氣比吸氣容易解决。並且排氣汽門可以做得比吸氣的小。同樣的理由。就是排氣汽門旁的間隙也可以比吸氣的少一些。用了這一點理論在設計燃燒室的時候。進氣系的吸氣量就可以增加。而引擎的體積效率在高速度時也可以增進了。不特如此。這排氣汽門的面積對體積的比例增大。可以使迥氣容易冷却。並可以避免爆炸的趨向。</p>
<p>因馬力的逐漸增高。這使汽缸需要一極有效的冷却制度。特別是在排氣汽門座的地方。目前有兩種方法。一種方法是裝一分水器在水套內使噴水到排氣汽門的壁上。另一種方法是引長水套直到拐軸箱。前者的利益可以使排氣汽門座的熱度减低。可以减少汽門座的捐壞。更可以防止汽門的逐漸下沉。後者的利益可以使拐軸箱的油的熱度降低。保護其易損壞部份就在極嚴重的工作狀况下不致於損害。</p>
<p>軸承的負荷亦因速度的增高而增加。所以有時候所用的安全數似已不適用了。因此拐軸在許多地方都更完全的平衡重量。使總軸承上的載荷减輕。引擎中載荷最重的軸承——除了活塞針以外。因爲這裏面摩擦損壞不大的綠故。——可以算是拐軸針的軸承。現在有兩種運客車上都用一種含鉛特多的靑銅來做這軸承。更有一種車上用鉲，銀，銅的合金來做軸承。這合金的性質和含鉛的青銅相似有極高的溶化點。而且在高熱度下也不會損失牠的力量。</p>
<p>鋁製汽缸。爲用更廣。雖然其中有一家製造廠因了成本的關係放棄了這方法。此外在過去的五年中。汽車上的機械設備可以增進行車的舒適便利和經濟的產生頗多。製造廠家都定以爲標準的設備。這是很明顯的在過去七年中。雖在極困難時期中。製造廠家對於設備方面是積極謀其完備。以求銷路之暢達。但是在今年情形却不同了。有許多廠家竟放棄了好些去年以爲標準的設備。其原因就因其製造價格的增高和外界購買力量的减低。</p>
<p>化汽機的設備沒有多大的變更。氣流向下的化汽機現在已差不多是成了全世界所採用的設備，濾氣器與吸氣避響器也爲用甚廣。在許多八汽缸的引擎上。無論是V形或直列式的。雙化汽機現已被採用。火星綫圈現在也有許多製造廠家把牠移在引擎上。這樣可以减縮高壓電綫的長度，無綫電的隔離可以比較容易些。並且對於發火也是有益處的。</p>
<p>對於引擎的潤滑系大家也曾加以相當的注意。在至少有兩種引擎上面。量表的管口已採用在拐軸上。其好處就在輸油率不受軸承空隙的影響。因此對於機件的漸次磨損是沒有什麼關係了。我們的純騐吿訴我們。當一輛汽車行駛過了若干里程之後。潤滑油往往難於維持到相當的壓力。可是這困難現在已被量表的管口所解决。此外更有一種新發展。就是採用較大的抽油機與油路。其缺點。使潤滑油在汽車剛剛開動的時候就供給平常的油量發生困難。在派克的汽車上有一種可拿濾油器。可以變更油的壓力使自動掃淸濾油的中間物。雪佛蘭車上增設一種射油器。來潤滑拐軸針的軸承的。潤滑油被射到接連桿的孔中。其壓力的高低隨行車的速度而變更。</p>
<p>發電機的容量也增大了。但是牠的體積並不增大。重量也不增。我們祇須添一個風扇上去就可以了，同時在可能範圍之內來增加牠的速率。在派克車上發電機可以供給三十安倍的電流。但這也有一點壞處。就是容易使電池過量的充電而致損壞。所以新式的更有一種保護的繼電器。</p>
<p>傳力盒有許多的問題發生。其原因爲第一動力機的馬力逐漸增大而傳力盒的尺寸沒有改變第。二近年來對於管理上力求其便利。改革的地方甚多。要對付這些問題可有兩種解决方法。（一）增加傳力盒的機械利益。這就是要增加傳力盒的踏板的行程。似不合算。（二）减低傳力盒板上的壓力。因此就减少其預備容量。不過如此必使傳力盒發生滑動現象而致發熱與摩損·要避免這一點困難。現在我們用了通風的方法。其通氣口有濾氣幕以防塵埃的侵入。</p>
<p>更有一種新式的半離心力式的傳力盒。其上裝有一個或一排的彈簧。利用其較輕的壓力傳達機器的最大扭轉力。</p>
<p>末了。說到庫製方面。水力車製很時髦。從前螺旋葉軸上的緊急車掣總是連在水力車掣上，但在現有我們用了車掣桿之後。就可省去一個緊急車掣了。此外有一種眞空動力車製。爲赫泊所採用。不過克雷斯勒却又放棄了這種車製。</p>
<h3>小奧斯汀又一勝利</h3>

<h3>道路安全問題的檢討</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>（一）安全的進步</p>
<p>目前。關於汽車方面。最嚴重的一個問題。便是使道路的上面。肇禍案件的减少。也許這是沒有一個人會不承認的吧。因此。一般運用道路的人。便應負責去解决這個問題，使肇禍案伴能够切實地减少。我們在沒有注意到道路之中。行駛的汽車。正在一天天的增多之前。雖然會知道汽車肇案件。根據每一個星期。每一個月的調查紀錄上面。祇在加增。並加减少。然而汽車的製造。目前比過往。甚至比幾年之前。安全問題。無論如何。已進步了不少。這是任何人不會否認的。我們就英國種種紀錄說來。在過去三年之中。道路之中。所行駛的汽車。大致增加百分之九·四。可是肇禍案件之中。死傷的人數祇增加了百分之一。這種比較的方法。如果依照汽車所行的里程和汽油的消耗。那麼我們在汽車所消費的汽油上。便可知道被汽車輾斃的人。在過去十年之中。每一百萬加侖中。已有百分之八·七一跌之百分之六·六七。</p>
<p>（二）道路的安全</p>
<p>用這種比較的方法。究竟是怎樣的去證明道路安全的改進呢。便是把所有的汽車行程的哩程。併在一起。而和所有的汽車傷人案件。作一統計。那麼我們便可得到一個答案。便是假定一輛汽車。每年行路三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇。經過四百三十年的行駛。才會輾斃一個行人。而且這個統計。事實上還估得很高一些。此外更有一件事情。我們應得知道的便是過往汽車殺人的統計。別方面的影響。都不去注意的。可是最近在英國境內。已發現到吹冷東風的天氣。每使汽車行路感到不便。同樣的一個星期之中。殺人的紀錄。要比平常增加一半。而英國方面。更已證明在汽車殺人案中。爲了道路的不良而致死者。祗佔百分之一·五。努力於改進道路建築的人士。更想把這百分之一·五的紀錄。能够完全消滅。道路安全的得以進步。唯一的原因。就在應用道路的人，已大都能够負責防止。和駕駛汽車。手術的處理。已有甚多的進步。而這種改進。窮源追本。却要歸功於汽車製造的進歩。目前你們所購置的汽車。重力中心點的改低。十字車架條的堅固。塞車配重的效果。全鋼車身。安全玻璃。一切的一切。都足使乘客的安全。得以增進的。</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>（三）引擎的安全</p>
<p>進一步說。引擎的柔順。運用齒輪。因爲諧動之故。簡便和神速。停車或轉灣時指號的簡明。頭燈統制的易如。使得現代的汽車。司機人的統馭。比幾年以前的汽車。便當得多。因此。司機人在行車之時。得以不必多注意於機件的處理。儘可把視綫常集中於車前的路面。而關心於安全問題。假如我們能够記着上面的種種優點。那麼就可知道汽車是現代交通器具中很安全的一種。同時。我們更不能忘記目前汽車的行駛。已有很好的成績。凡是以前所不能的。現在都已能够了。試車。催滑。以及其他種種的各費成本和科學裝置。都足使你的汽車增進安全而加增行路值價。汽車的日見發達。無疑。任何駕駛汽車的人們應得格外的小心住意。以防路中同行的車輛一多。容易肇禍。同時。司機人更應去督促汽車製造廠。製造工作精益求精。力使肇禍成分的消滅。這樣汽車的安全程度。自必得以增進。道路行旅的安全與舒快。是一種無限量的惠賜。在這一個時代。我們知道比以前是進步得多。可是此後我們更應負起責任。使之更見完美。而要求達此目的。最重要的一點。當然在求肇禍案件的减少。這是每一個行旅者都應負責去促進的一件事情。</p>
<h3>汽車用蓄電池日常檢視和保護法</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>蓄電池在整個汽車上。不過佔着二種附屬品的地位。一般的車主和駕駛者。往往不去重視牠。這實在是大大的錯誤。要知這小小的蓄電池。實在是挖制全車生命的中樞。引擎的爆發。車前燈在夜間的照耀。喇叭的響聲。一切的一切。都賴着這小小的蓄電池的輸電。假使一旦蓄電池發生障礙。那麼你的引擎雖然有很充量的汽油供給。但是不會達到行駛的目的啊。所以。在應用蓄電池的時候。我們應當在規定的時間內隨時去檢察和保護。使牠不會發生任何障礦。這實在是每一個駕駛者應有的責任啊。現在且把最重要的幾點。略述如後。</p>
<p>（一）檢量電壓——在蓄電池輸電日久後（大約三星期餘）。牠的電壓就要慢慢低下來。同時電流也會小下來。這個時候應當用電壓表（卽伏脫表）量其短路電壓。（用表的兩端眞接觸正負極。時間宜短）。輸電後的電壓。不少於一·七五伏脫。（此指普通一般汽車用蓄電池而言）。一到這個限度。就應當馬上充電。否則電極板上就會有硫酸結晶體依附。結果使整個電池失其效用。</p>
<p>（二）電液的加注——蓄電池因爲時時輸電和充電的結果。使電液漸漸的蒸發。電液內所含的成分是硫酸和蒸溜水。其中硫酸的容量是不會减少的。我們祗許隨時加注蒸溜水。務使電極板的上端水平綫。完全浸在電液內。</p>
<p>（三）充電時應用的注意——在輸電後電壓降到一·七五伏脫時。卽應充電。但充電時必須有下列幾種注意：</p>
<p>（A）充電時間。至少須五小時。</p>
<p>（B）充電時有氣體在電極周圍洩出。此種氣體富於燃燒性。勿與火光接近。以免炸裂。</p>
<p>（C）避免過分充電。因爲過分充電能使電液加速蒸發。同時使電極上的金屬屑沉落池底。容易發生短路的危險。</p>
<p>（D）蓄電池一經輸電弱小後。應立刻充電。不應擱置三個月的限期。（否則電極上就生牢固的硫酸結晶體。毀損整個電池。</p>
<p>（四）電液比重的規定——電液的比重。應有規定。充電後的電液最高比重。不得超過一·三〇〇。輸電後的低比重。不得低於一·一五〇。這種比重的測騐。可應用比重計揷入電液內。使其自動升降以測定之。</p>
<p>（五）蓄電液淸潔時之注意——如其要除去池底的積垢或沉澱物用等。第一步手續。先將這蓄電池完全充電。然後把電極板取出。用蒸溜水將電極和池的四周細細冲凈。電極應在未乾時放回原處。有幾種蓄電池上都預備着特製的淸潔制。可以不用拆卸附件。</p>
<p>（六）電極板上如發現銹蝕等現象。卽應另換新板。以保持恒定的電壓。此種更換電板。可向附近電料行配置。</p>
<p>（七）電極兩端應隨時保持導電狀態。少塗凡士林。使不生銹。</p>
<p>（八）電池頂部的出氣孔。應時時保持流通。勿使淤塞。</p>
<p>以上的幾種。是最緊要的保護蓄電池法。每一個駕駛的應當時時留意。現在一般汽車上用的電池。都是鉛板蓄電池。牠的價格比愛迪生蓄電池來得廉。不過鉛板每易生銹蝕等現像。此點必須時時察看。以便更換。</p>
<p>現在的新式汽車上。都採用電機電池銜接制。蓄電池在輸電過分後。隨時自動的被發電機充電。這種循環制的簡便。和迅述。洵爲優點。不過有時候這種的充電量太弱小。我們不得不利用其他的充電方法啊。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀添建新工場</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>運用電鍵裝配車身</p>
<p>奧斯汀汽車公司。頃又於其朗勃列琪廠內。添建一新工塲。利用最新式輸送機器。從事於裝配工作。其敏捷巧妙。殊足驚人。新工塲價值二萬鎊。地板面積四萬一千方尺。係專供車身裝配暨其附屬工作之用。所有奧斯汀車身與底盤之配合。卽皆成於斯處。計每輛配合成功。所費時間僅一分半鐘。卽每星期約可配合二千次。</p>

<h3>奧斯摩別爾新車概述</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>一九三五年式奧期摩別爾六缸及直列八缸新車。茲已貢獻於世。新車較前尤爲寬敞偉大。不僅具有一九三四年度所有種種機械工程上的進展。且更具有若干關係重要之新特色。新車主要進步之首應述及者。願爲飛喜車身。今所裝配之車頂。乃以堅實無縫之鋼板壓製而成。與車身嚴密組合。宛如一整個部份。乘客置身車內。則不論上下或其餘任何方面。均有堅强卓絕之鋼料。爲其安全保障。至於流綫設計。則使全車姿態。曼妙壯觀。彌極動人。斯蓋由新式水箱頭。以及後保險槓確能澈底流綫化者</p>

<h3>阮玲玉自殺的心理分析</h3>
<p>— 伯寗</p>
<p>情海風波在電影界原不算一會事。好萊塢每年發生的桃色事件，也不知幾十次。不說國外，在國內影台上，也已有不少風流史料，曾經轟動過一時。爲什麼那一般人，都能愉愉快快，歡歡喜喜地生活下去，獨有阮玲玉偏要和自己生命鬥氣，毅然决然地拋棄了這世界？這一定不是偶然的事，一部分自然也有她的社會背境。但記者以爲她個人的心理條件，應該是構成她自殺的重要因素</p>
<p>她的情緒生活……誰都知道情緒能决定人的行爲。憂鬱的人不能呌他手舞足蹈。愉快的人不能呌他愁眉苦眼。但是人們但知過情緒會决定行爲，不知道行爲也能决定情緒。美國某心理學家曾說過：「人不是悲哀纔哭，是哭了纔悲哀；人不是快樂纔笑，是笑了纔快藥。」我們看阮玲玉所主演的片子，如「故都春夢」，「小玩意」，「人生」「神女」，和最近的「新女性」，都是社會的悲劇。電影原是戲，戲原是做做而己，但是要做得追眞，要做得動人，那末演員須把戲劇認爲自己人生的一部分。這是影響演員情緒生活的地方。那就是「哭了纔悲哀」啊。阮玲玉這種悲哀的情緒在平時還隱伏着，不易觀察到。一遇不如意事，當然一發而不可止了。</p>
<p>可怕的經騐哪……人們怎樣去應付環境？二部分亦是由舊經騐去决定的。日木的妻子見了丈夫，俯身下去替他脫木屐，美國的妻子見了丈夫，蹺起了脚要他脫高跟鞋，這都是由她們舊經騐所决定。决計不會日本妻子見了丈夫蹺起脚來，美國妻子見了丈夫俯下身去的。阮玲玉和張達民同居時，曾經服過一次毒，這便是她的舊經騐，因此現在她逢到了困難，她的舊經驗又活躍了起來，加以悲哀的情緒，『强烈的暗示』，她就身不由主地走上舊路了。</p>
<p>强烈的暗示……上邊說强烈的暗示，什麼是强烈的暗示呢？凡人有了「預存狀態」，遇到某種刺激，便成強烈暗示。譬如馬路上的黃包車夫，他預存着一個「客人呌車的預存狀態」，任何一人在戲院門口無意舉一舉手，他們便挽了車飛奔而來了。阮玲玉對於自殺已有了舊經騐，而且被惡劣的情緒，當前的難題所喚起。已存了一種「自殺的預存狀態」了。待她從揚子飯店回家時，據說阮在死前曾見過兩個無常鬼影，這就是錯覺。並且因爲她素來信鬼，她就認定她自己大概「命已該絕」，就一門心思走上死路了。唉！這樣一顆有希望的影星，竟爾上了自己心理的當，香消玉殞，眞是人間悲劇。</p>
<p>此後的問題……阮玲玉是死了。我們除了咨嗟歡息，也無法補救。然而她還留下來一個嚴重的心理問題呢。我們知道哥德的少年維持之煩惱出版以後，德國靑年殉情而死的不知多少。自殺在社會上也成了時髦的事。維持還是一個小說中的人物。阮玲玉是一個眞實的藝人，又是現代靑年敬愛，同情的人物。她這一死恐怕會給與靑年們一種「授意」Suggestion。諸位，不要看不起授意的作用，波爾文Porf．J．M．Baldwin說：「授意是心理的，和社會的二方面的　　　呢。那末我們對於靑年男女實有預防的責任。這事，尤其新聞界是該加倍注意的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「小泰山情史」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Orawling　Death—巴黎映</p>
<p>像「人猿泰山」之類的故事，差不多是一種神話，但是這一被譯「小泰山情史」的「Crawling　Death」、却有一個比較接近人情的故事。鮑勃的父母離婚之後，鮑勃的母親便帶了他同往墨西哥邊境的山林中。十年之後，鮑勃父親尋來了，夫妻破鏡重圓。這些，自然是比較說得通的。</p>
<p>但是這說得通的故事，却可惜給低能的劇作者弄成破碎零亂，甚至於不知所云，簡直不成爲故事，結果不知道應當表現一些什麼東西。</p>
<p>這裏少不了也有一些野獸出現，可是大部份都是馴了的，如蛇，如鱷魚，當劇中人去捕牠們的時候，幾乎是死了的一樣。其中有一塲野牛和老虎的搏鬥，堪稱片中最精采之處，但是顯而易見，那是從其他的影片中剪來的，這由於那時候突然有一個黑種小孩出現，便可體明，因爲他是和整個的影片完全無關的。</p>
<p>這裏說明本片的作者純粹的以不高明的方法來唯利是圖，所以其中還有一羣少女的裸浴出現。但是就連這一點也是沒有成功的，這因爲一九三五年的觀衆，經常接觸了不少技巧圓熟的影片，對於這種作品，自然是覺得無甚可取的。再說罷，在目前有多少獸片，都不能引起人們的興趣，雖然是曾經哄動一時，可是到如今已經是過時了的，何况是粗製濫造的庸俗之作呢？</p>
<p>觀眾意見</p>
<h3>「蛇蝎美人」我評</h3>
<p>— 痴影</p>
<p>這以「渦漩」改名的「蛇蝎美人」，是以一個極平凡的故事，所構成的，從各方面看來，並沒有怎樣值得注意的奇績。它所給于我們的，也是一些極平淡的影象。它的故事，是以都市萬惡的漩渦，而造成了一個家庭的慘變，所以他所吿訴我們的，也就是說「缺乏自持的人們，當心着都市的萬惡漩渦吧！」</p>
<p>但是導演人，很疏忽了現貿方面：像王桂林以過敏性的神經，把水的漩渦、來嘆息兒干日後的命運。張翼以四十元的薪金，住着這中產階級人們所享受的房子。以棄舊迎新的交際花，竟以魁悟，勇敢，誠實的幾個條件，而愛上了張翼的無產階級者。這些都似乎是憑空想象而成。</p>
<p>導演者對於交際花的身世生活，也忘却了介紹，倘若沒有說明書，那末幾乎使觀衆認爲她是一個舞女了。關於都市的罪惡與蛇蝎性的美人，也都沒有澈底的指示，它在畫面上所表現的，只有是一部份朝秦暮楚的交際花而已。</p>
<p>演員以張翼爲最佳，他的一副剛毅的演出，是很可取的。陳燕燕之特長於惹人愛憐之處，在這裏也沒有充分之發展。王桂林王默秋二人，尙能稱職。劉繼羣以短短幾幕的都市紳士氣派，頗覺老練。</p>
<p>全劇的演出，前半部稍有可取，後半部却很多精彩，像失寵後張翼的發狂，與最後之汽車疾馳等。又如陳燕燕等待張翼的歸來，由黃昏而至天明，相映着兒子的熟睡，大有「蝴蝶夫人」的風味。不過攝影欠佳，光綫太覺暗淡了。</p>
<h3>「英雄歷險記」主角瓊蘿蕙的一些</h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>瓊蘿蕙（Joan　Lowell，也卽最近電電華新片「英雌歷險記」的主角）生長於加利福尼亞的柏柯里地方。她排行第十一。她的母親是詩人（James　Russeff　Lowell）的表妹。她的父親是一個小航船的船主，在瓊只有十一個月大的時侯，他就把她帶到海上去過船上的生活，一直到滿十七歲的那年。她在這十餘年中，長得像一個男孩子的模樣。她已懂得船上一切瑣屑的事情，也很情願去做。到了十七歲，她的父親才把她送上岸陸，向她說，「從此你應該去持握住你的生活之舵，在你的人生道路上去航行了。」</p>
<p>她穿了一身不合身的衣服跑到了陸地上，開始試着各種職務。她工作得就好像一個半工半讀的學生一樣，白天做她的工作，晚間跑到夜學校裏去讀書。又做了一個職業的游泳家。</p>
<p>她並且能著作。她寫了一部驚奇的探險小說「The　Cradle　of　the　Deep」。出版後，不到數星期內，十萬餘部的書便售盡了，同時這部書被選爲一月內的最好的著作，這是一九二九年的四月。</p>
<p>以後瓊蘿蕙便常寫些小說之類的文章投寄到「四海雜誌」和「星期六晚報」上去發表，而從社會裏的各種團體上得到無數的讚譽與光榮。</p>
<p>她像一個報館的旅行記者似的旅行到各處地方。在一九三三年四月裏，她和她的七十六歲的老父並兩位水手，巡遊了全世界。</p>
<p>她身高五英尺四吋。重一百十七磅。她也是一個航空飛行家，馬術精深的婦女，打獵的能手，游泳的健將，所有各門的運動，她都非常精通。是一位希有的天才女子。</p>
<h3>梅琳結婚世界奇聞</h3>
<p>爲一般影迷最所矚目的一顆聯華的新星梅琳，她的這部「無愁君子」當然也是人們極度渴望的影片，我們可以報吿大家，這「無愁君子」不久可與社會人仕相見，而梅琳在這片中是一舉成功了。</p>
<p>梅琳能夠一舉成功，自然是件可喜的事，如果我們談到梅琳所做的「無愁君子」「天倫」這兩部片中的結婚事，那又是件極其可笑的事。「無愁君子」中她曾與韓蘭根結婚之後，又與劉繼羣結婚。如今方與韓劉結婚不久，「天倫」中又與鄭君里結婚了。不過，她在「天倫」中與鄭君果結婚，是由戀愛結合婚前是經過不少奮鬥的，與韓劉二人結婚呢，她們是如何舉行的婚禮，連梅琳他自己都一點不知道。一個女人和兩個男人經過兩次的結婚而自己竟毫不知情，像這樣的事，不能說不是世界的奇聞吧。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>威靈登軼事（The　Iron　Duke）（七）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>希望消滅了，軍隊潰散了，拿破侖像一隻鎩羽的蒼鷹，立即奔回巴黎。他轉戰了一百天，那就是歷史上有名的百日戰爭。他的天才，他的威力，固然不减當初，但是時運不道，大勢已去，俗語說得好，兵倒如山崩，這又有誰能挽回呢？拿破侖百日的代價，就是被放逐到聖赫侖拿島上去。</p>
<p>再過了一個月，各國的君王和使臣，重新在巴黎召集了和平會議，去瓜分那勝利的結果。威靈登公爵身爲武人，本來不慣掂斤論兩的勾當，現在却被派充了使臣之一，眼看着這一般歐洲的主宰，紛呶咆哮，和從前同樣的爭持着，未免心中覺得有些看不起。法王路易十八，現在已經回到巴黎，重登寳座，在他身旁，仍舊站着那位瑪麗安東尼的女兒，驕恣專橫，和她母親一樣想獨攬國家大權。在路易的寢宮外面，威靈登公爵心亂如麻的踱來踱去。一回兒寢宮的門開了，但並沒有使臣出來宣召威靈登。安諾勒公爵夫人却走了出來。她走到威靈登面前站住了，嘴上露着一副冷笑的神氣。威靈登談然道；「蒙夫人出來接見，固當榮幸得很，但是我所要見的，却是皇帝陛下。「夫人道：「我是他的顧問。陛下今天有些不像。』威靈登道：「你將南衣大將逮捕，如果你將他處死的話，那法國必定重起內亂。南衣殉難的大名，你却造就了。」</p>
<p>公爵夫人不覺，瞪着兩雄眼恨恨的說道：「我祇求爲我父我母復仇。你是想剝奪法國國主復仇的能力的人，因此我深恨你，無論如何我必定要除掉你的……」威靈登道：「如果你將南衣大將槍斃了，前途就不堪設想了。」公爵夫人益加憤憤地道：「那不久就可以看得見的。他非槍斃不可！」威靈登力自遏住了自巳的憤怒，冷然說道：「那事發生的一天，我就將你和其他的一般顧問們驅逐出宮。」公爵夫人掉過頭去，她說：「你的話我當轉陳陛下。」她說着就進去了。</p>
<p>在巴黎皇家劇塲之中，燈燭輝煇，照耀得如同白畫。盛裝的婦人，聯軍將士們的命婦，由她們雄糾糾的丈夫陪伴着，分坐在包廂之中。在當中的皂室特廂中，那裏坐着安諾勒公爵夫人，和法王路易的兄弟，珂道亞公爵。皇室特廂旁邊的廂中，還有普魯士士王和俄羅斯的少皇等。他們四週都站滿了侍從武官。在距安諾勒公爵夫人稍遠的地方，有一個較小些而不茶煊赫的廂中，坐着威靈登公爵和茀蘭茜斯動爵夫人。</p>
<p>這時威靈登對着茀蘭茜斯道：「我不能不說，你來到巴黎是件愚笨的事。你有你的丈夫，他現在倫敦。」茀蘭茜斯看了威靈登一眼說道：『我來是爲你來的。』威靈登道：「那有什麼分別？你還是一個小傻子呀子。」這個時候，皇室特廂之中，有六對眼睛瞪着看着他們二人。那第三對眼睛的所有者，是一個獐頭鼠目，形貌委瑣的人，那是倫敦一家報紙的駐巴黎記者。（未完）</p>

<p>Commemorative ceremonies and tree planting held separately in various regions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government jointly held a memorial meeting for the tenth anniversary of the Premier's passing at the Central Party Headquarters at 8:00 AM on the 12th. The inside and outside of the Party Headquarters were decorated with plain flowers and slogans, creating a solemn atmosphere. Among those present were Central Committee members Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Li Zonghuang, Li Liejun, Zhang Zhiben, Zhu Peide, Chu Minyi, Chen Gongbo, National Government Chairman Lin, National Committee members Ma Chaojun, Deng Jiayan, Chen Lifu, and Wei Huai, Lu Chao, as well as heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Niu Yongjian, Chen Daqi, Xu Chonghao, Wang Yongbin, Chen Diaoyuan, Chen Xunyong, Cao Haosen, representatives of various organizations Chen Zhuo, Wu Dajun, and Party and government officials, totaling over 700 people.

After three minutes of silence, they proceeded in an orderly fashion to pay their respects inside the mausoleum. The ceremony concluded and everyone dispersed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the report delivered by Committee Member Wang at the memorial meeting for the tenth anniversary of the Premier's passing held at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 12th is as follows: "Ten years ago today, as the Premier was on his deathbed, he continuously called out 'Peace,' 'Struggle,' and 'Save China.' These words still echo in the ears of many comrades. Ten years later today, facing such an unprecedented national crisis, we deeply understand that to salvage this unprecedented national crisis, there is no other path but to exert our own efforts to develop the people's strength and replenish the nation's power. Amidst the chaos and turmoil, we reluctantly seek a temporarily stable environment so that we can engage in necessary work. Whether we achieve merit or incur blame in the future depends entirely on our own efforts. If we take advantage of stability to seek temporary ease, then we are unworthy descendants of the Premier and traitors to China. If we take advantage of stability to actively prepare for the work of saving the nation and ensuring its survival, then there is still hope of reversing the national crisis. In the work of saving the nation and ensuring its survival, the most urgent measure is to eliminate the communist bandits, and the most fundamental measure is to engage in production and construction. This is what many comrades have been earnestly undertaking in recent years. Last winter, the remnants of the communist bandits in Jiangxi attempted to flee through Hunan and Guizhou into southern Sichuan to coordinate with the communist bandits in northern Sichuan, attempting to utilize Sichuan's vast territory and abundant resources as a base and to establish what they called an 'international route.' Recently, due to the efforts of the troops suppressing the bandits, the communist bandits who fled to southern Sichuan have been scattered and are tending to disintegrate. The communist bandits in northern Sichuan are also unable to maintain a foothold and are about to flee to Shaanxi. Although it cannot be said that these two groups of communist bandits have been completely eliminated, their attempt to use Sichuan as a base can undoubtedly be considered a failure. If the troops suppressing the bandits and the people continue to work hard, the day of their elimination will not be far off. As for production and construction, due to economic difficulties, financial constraints, and various other factors, although some progress has been made, it is still far from the original planned objectives. This is deeply regrettable. Moreover, at this time, we are also encountering the silver problem, which has led to a severe shortage of money, greatly impacting the industrial and commercial sectors. It truly feels like 'leaking roofs meeting continuous rain, and adverse winds hitting head-on against upstream boats.' In this critical moment, the only way is for the entire nation to unite and work together to overcome this difficulty. Recently, there have been calls for international economic assistance. Based on the Premier's industrial plan and the principles of international equality and mutual assistance, we are naturally pleased to hear these calls. However, fundamentally, we must still rely on our own efforts. The above is a brief account of the recent domestic situation in commemoration of the Premier. We remember the passing of our mentor and lament the great calamities that lie ahead. We can only follow the motto of 'Peace,' 'Struggle,' and 'Save China' and do our best." After Committee Member Wang finished his report, he expressed deep gratitude for the enthusiasm and sincerity of the Japanese officials and people who held a memorial ceremony in Tokyo today, saying that this move could enhance the friendship between China and Japan, so that people in both countries could have a clearer understanding of Sino-Japanese relations.

<p>(Nanjing) At 2:00 PM on the 12th, all circles in the capital held a tree planting ceremony at Xiaolingwei, with airplanes scattering slogans. Those who attended included National Government Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Niu Yongjian, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Gongbo, Zhang Daofan, Luo Jialun, Wu Jingheng, Li Zonghuang, and others, as well as representatives from various organizations, schools, and Party branches, and soldiers from the Training Corps, totaling over 10,000 people. After the meeting commenced and the ceremony was performed according to protocol, Chairman Chen Gongbo delivered an opening speech, stating in brief that today is the tenth anniversary of the Premier's passing and also the National Arbor Day, and it also coincides with the date when the National Government officially decreed that the new Forestry Law would come into effect, so the significance of tree planting this year is extremely important. As for what should be reported today, the first is the statistics of afforestation in recent years: (A) Achievements in commemorating the Premier's passing: from the 19th year to the 23rd year, there were a total of 23,958,770 trees and 538,706 mu; (B) Forestry farms under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry: from the 21st year to the 23rd year, there were a total of 13,526,771 trees and 314,618 mu; (C) Afforestation in various provinces and cities: from the 21st year to the 23rd year, there were 187,001,726 trees and 14,908,346 mu. The three statistics show a total of 224,487,267 trees and 15,761,672 hectares of afforestation. The second is the facilities of the Ministry of Industry: (1) Implementing a general inspection of the afforestation achievements of the central government-administered forestry farms and various provinces, cities, and counties over the years; (2) Dispatching forestry and reclamation investigation teams to various provinces to investigate forestry and reclamation and survey suitable barren mountains and forests, and preparing for the compilation of state-owned forests; (3) Actively carrying out protective forests in the Huaihe and Yellow River basins. As for the spirit of the new Forestry Law that is being implemented today, there are several points worth noting: 1. Adopt a proactive policy; 2. Emphasize the spirit of cooperation and promote private forestry; 3. Emphasize protection; 4. Strictly supervise and provide practical guidance; 5. Carefully incorporate and remove protective forests. As for today's tree planting, a large number of armed comrades participated. It is hoped that the promotion of military and industrial afforestation can be promoted in the future, and it is hoped that the capital will start this trend this year, and comrades and soldiers in various places will follow suit. China's forestry will definitely make great progress in the shortest possible time. Then, Li Zonghuang, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters, gave a speech, roughly saying that the afforestation policy should, in his personal opinion, first enable everyone to automatically plant, cultivate, and protect trees; second, actively instill it into national public organizations to do the same; and third, use the power of the government and public organizations to inject knowledge of planting trees into the people, so that the young and old, men and women, all know the importance of planting trees. It is especially hoped that the central government officials will first work hard to plant trees to set an example. Next, Chairman Lin gave a speech, roughly saying that the problem of afforestation is extremely big. Now everyone knows to plant trees, but it is even more hoped that everyone can pay close attention to protecting trees, because planting trees without knowing how to protect them is easy to be destroyed and achieve very little results. Also, today, seeing armed comrades participating in afforestation work is extremely gratifying. Under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the various armies are doing their best in social work in various provinces to suppress bandits, such as opening up roads in various places, which are mostly done by military and industrial personnel and have achieved very good results. In the future, if armed comrades can maintain this strong interest and participate in tree planting, then there will be roads and trees, and where there are trees, there will be forests, and the benefits to the country and society will be immeasurable. It is even more hoped that armed comrades can plant a tree per person per year, so that after eight or ten years, there will be many forests in various places, and all floods and droughts can be reduced, and the purpose of afforestation can also be achieved. Subsequently, Wu Zhihui, Luo Jialun, and Gui Yongqing delivered speeches one after another. After the speeches, the meeting was adjourned. After the adjournment, they immediately went to the south of Jingtang Road to plant trees, which was divided into eight areas, covering about 70 mu. Chairman Lin and the heads of the five Yuan each planted a tree by hand and erected a stone tablet to commemorate it. The planting was completed gradually until about 5:00 PM.

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Reflections After Arriving in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Speech at the Expanded Memorial Week in Chongqing</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek attended the expanded memorial week for party, government, and military personnel on the morning of the 11th and gave a speech. He briefly stated that since his arrival in Chongqing, nearly ten days ago, he has observed the local social and political aspects and is pleased with the generally good situation. Today, he will offer a few points based on his observations. First, if we want to improve society, complete the revolution, and build a modern nation, we must first ensure that all citizens of the country, especially the staff of party, government, and military institutions, possess the basic common sense that modern citizens must have. The reason why China is in such a state of national crisis and popular suffering is generally believed to be the lack of military strength for self-defense. However, this is only a superficial and secondary reason. The fundamental and important reason is that the general public, and even those in the party, government, and military who are responsible for governing the country and leading the people, lack the common sense of modern citizens. Therefore, striving to enrich subordinates and the general public with this kind of common sense is the most crucial and fundamental urgent task for us in revolutionary nation-building from now on. The so-called common sense of modern citizens has many aspects, which cannot all be described in detail. The most important thing is to recognize that the nation is an organic organization, just like an individual with life, spirit, will, and appearance. The national flag is the sacred appearance of the nation, and the national anthem is the solemn sound of the nation. Therefore, wherever the national flag and national anthem are, we know where the nation is. All citizens, no matter when or where, must unanimously respect and cherish them. Moreover, the national flag must be made in accordance with regulations, be neat and uniform, be hung with respect, and be raised and lowered on time, so that people will be respectful when they see it. When singing the national anthem, one must be dignified, have a measured tone, and a harmonious voice, so that people will be solemn when they hear it. Because to make the people's minds consistent and their spirits united, we must first pay attention to the national flag and national anthem that they see and hear. Therefore, seeking uniformity in the size of the national flag and the intonation of the national anthem is the most important and basic common sense for uniting the spirit, unifying the will, and cultivating modern citizens. Second, the general malady of Chinese people today and the reason why all undertakings cannot be promoted lies in following old ways and being content with the current situation, being perfunctory and irresponsible, being half-hearted in doing good, and being unheroic in doing what is right. If we want to correct these current ills and complete the great cause of revolutionary nation-building, our comrades in the party, government, and military must adhere to the spirit of acting bravely upon seeing what is right and being pragmatic, and strive hard according to the two major principles of speed and certainty. That is what I mean by revolutionary nation-building: we must act quickly, practically, and resolutely to succeed. Taking Sichuan as an example, at present, such things as the improvement of police administration, the opening up of roads, and the speedy resolution of lawsuits are all the most urgent and essential tasks for seeking governance. However, we must pay special attention to time and cherish time. We must know that all undertakings are born of time. Wasting time or delaying time is tantamount to cutting off our own path to survival. In short, everyone who knows and can act must persevere to the end. As for how to adapt to local conditions and adapt to the times to increase the effectiveness and promote perfection, it is also something that those in power should consider. Third, the key to governance and construction lies in being good at organization, training, management, rewards, and punishments. When used properly, we should always use the labor of the local people to open up local transportation, cultivate local land, and increase local production. We must know that the labor of the people is the basic quantity for nation-building, and it is also the driving force of funding. If we can only organize and use it, we will be able to complete various construction undertakings to seek economic prosperity and bring the country to the realm of wealth and strength. Moreover, in this time of national distress and popular poverty, only by making poor plans and first carrying out construction undertakings that do not cost money can we have the possibility of completing the revolutionary construction. In the past, places like Jiangxi and Hunan have worked hard in this way and have achieved great results. Sichuan has always been known as the Land of Abundance. If it can catch up quickly, its success will be far-reaching. However, the people of Sichuan have been in distress for a long time, and their strength is exhausted. Therefore, the organization and use must not only be appropriate, but nurturing the morale of the people, protecting the strength of the people, and cherishing the lives of the people are the sole and most important tasks of those responsible in the party, government, and military. Today, the people of Sichuan stand on tiptoe and their shapes are disappearing, their faces are full of smoke, and this is the case everywhere. This is truly the deep pain of the nation and the shame of comrades in the party, government, and military. From now on, how to cultivate the morale of the people, protect the strength of the people, cherish the lives of the people, and organize the masses and use the labor of the masses is our greatest responsibility and the only great cause of revolutionary construction. The above points are all based on my recent observations. I hereby sincerely offer them, and I hope that our comrades in the party, government, and military, under the leadership of Chairman Liu, will jointly and consistently implement them in accordance with the principles I have presented today. If we do so, the completion of the construction of a new Sichuan can be expected soon, and the foundation for the revival of the nation will be laid here.

<h3>International Loans to China, Britain Makes No Proposal, Lord Privy Seal Makes Statement in the House of Commons, Says Only Urged Powers to Pay Attention to Chinese Finance</h3>
<p>(London) The British Lord Privy Seal, Anthony Eden, stated in the House of Commons today that the British government has not proposed any international loans to China. Recently, newspapers have repeatedly carried news of international loans, believing that this proposal was initiated by Britain, causing people to have the impression that Britain, the United States, France, and Japan were discussing and proposing loans to China. Last week, British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons in response to a question from Lumley that the British government had no such plan. Today, Eden reiterated this statement, wanting to dispel incorrect impressions. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated on March 2 that what Britain had already done was, at China's request, urge the United States, France, and Japan to pay attention to China's financial difficulties.

<p>(New York) Japanese Ambassador Saito gave a speech at a foreign press banquet tonight, stating that the only purpose of Sino-Japanese friendship is the tranquility of East Asia and the gradual reduction of commercial and investment risks, and definitely not to reject Western participation in China's reconstruction. Saito also stated that there is no such thing as low social or labor endowments in Japanese business operations. If rumors can become reality and China no longer boycotts Japanese goods, then obvious commercial barriers can be removed. The world's recession is mostly caused by economic nationalism. Britain and the United States should work hard to eliminate commercial barriers. Japan deeply feels that the freedom of trade is an important prerequisite for the world's recovery.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Foreign Rice and Adjustment of Rice Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the Executive Yuan, at the request of the Shanghai Municipal Government, specially convened a review meeting on restricting the import of foreign rice in the capital, attended by representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Interior, the Rural Reconstruction Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, to decide on appropriate measures. After consultation, the opinions of all parties were combined into three points: The first point, the issue of the impact of foreign rice imports on the outflow of cash, has been handed over to the Ministries of Finance and Industry to study together with the case of rescuing industry and commerce. The second point, the issue of whether tariffs should be increased on foreign rice imports, has been decided to be determined based on the circumstances. The third point, the issue of whether full taxes should be levied on broken rice imports (currently half taxes), has been handed over to the Tariff Commission for review and decision.</p>
<p>The import of foreign rice into our country has been increasing in recent years, increasing more than tenfold compared to twenty years ago. Such a large amount of foreign grain being imported is due, on the one hand, to the dumping of surplus goods from overseas. On the other hand, the desolation of our country's rural areas and the frequency of droughts and floods are also the main reasons for promoting the large influx of foreign grain. During the summer and autumn last year, there was a severe drought for several months, and the rice harvest was poor. According to a survey by the Shanghai Rice, Bean, and Miscellaneous Grain Association, excluding the rice-rich areas of Wenzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang Province, there was a shortage of about 2 million dan. Jiangsu Province had a shortage of 1 million dan. Provinces like Anhui had a slight surplus, while Hubei and Hunan were generally self-sufficient. Jiangxi was able to supply itself. In total, there was a shortage of about 3 million dan in the Yangtze River basin. As a result, grain prices rose sharply in various places, and domestic and foreign rice merchants rushed to purchase foreign grain. According to reports from various foreign firms, as of the end of last year, the number of orders had reached more than 5 million bags, already exceeding the shortage. Since the beginning of this year, rice merchants have been placing orders one after another. It is heard that forward foreign rice for April and May has also been pre-ordered to more than 800,000 or 900,000 bags. If this continues, then the "expensive grain" of last autumn will become the "cheap grain" of this spring. The Chinese farmers who are currently "selling green seedlings" will neither benefit from the "expensive grain" of last autumn nor avoid losses from the "cheap grain" of this spring. The future of the rural areas is full of worries, and the impact on the restoration of China's economic prosperity in the future will inevitably be another obstacle.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan has convened a meeting at this critical juncture to try to reverse this difficult situation, which is certainly essential. However, the results of this meeting are only to save the current crisis, and it may not be enough to lay the foundation for the future. To prosper China's economy, we must start with revitalizing the rural areas. This is a truth that everyone knows. However, the revitalization of the rural areas should, on the one hand, study how to eliminate the roots that shackle today's rural areas and reduce the burden on farmers. On the other hand, we should study how to increase the income of farmers so that they can have sufficient food and clothing. If we advance on both sides in this way, the rural areas can recover, and industry and commerce can also prosper accordingly.</p>
<p>The main income of farmers is grain. Therefore, if we want to increase the income of farmers, at least the grain price must be in line with the cost of cultivation and must not fluctuate drastically. However, if we want to stabilize the grain price, we cannot but rely on the power of the government, and the government must have a definite and unchangeable policy. In other words, today, in order to revive the rural areas and adjust the people's food supply, the government should quickly and precisely investigate the national consumption of rice and grain, and then formulate certain laws and regulations, ordering rice and grain producers, rice merchants, and rice and grain warehouse operators to report the amount of rice and grain in stock at any time. When necessary, the government should conduct actual inspections to observe the proportion of supply and demand. At the same time, it should also refer to the cost of rice and grain production, general living expenses, and the trend of the rice price index to the price index to determine the highest and lowest prices. If the market price falls below the lowest price and the supply exceeds demand, the government can purchase rice and grain, increase foreign rice taxes, or restrict foreign rice imports to regulate the grain price. Conversely, the government can sell rice and grain, reduce foreign rice taxes, or exempt foreign rice taxes. In this way, the supply and demand of rice and grain can be adjusted, and the grain price will not fluctuate drastically. The benefits to farmers from this will be not small, and its contribution to the revival of the rural areas will certainly be significant. Today's meeting of the Executive Yuan is only temporary in nature, so what is discussed is naturally based on the current facts. If the situation changes in the future and new facts and phenomena occur, then a second meeting must be reopened. If this happens again and again, it will not only be uneconomical in terms of human resources, but it will also not be a "one-stop shop." Therefore, we deeply hope that after this review meeting, the government should seek a proper method to adjust the supply and demand of rice and grain to overcome the current difficulties of the recession.</p>
<h3>After the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway Is Concluded, Japan Takes Further Steps Towards Russia, Seeks to Resolve Various Pending Issues, Starts with Negotiations on Oil Rights First, Border Dispute Negotiations Are Difficult</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The draft agreement for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was signed at 9:30 p.m. on the 11th. This negotiation, which began with the first official negotiation on June 26, Showa 8 (1933), has lasted for one year and ten months, with a total of 56 meetings (including 6 official meetings, 24 meetings between Foreign Minister Hirota and Russian Envoy Yurenev, 4 intermediate consultations, 8 meetings between Director Togo of the European-Asian Bureau and Russian Representative Kozlovsky, and 16 drafting committee meetings). It can be seen how difficult the negotiations were. There were repeated crises on the verge of breaking down. However, as a result of Foreign Minister Hirota's efforts to mediate, it was successfully completed. After the signing yesterday, Foreign Minister Hirota and the Russian envoy continued to talk, exchanging various opinions on the fundamental adjustment of Japanese-Russian relations. The Foreign Minister said that the Eastern Railway negotiations had been concluded, and it was a matter of great congratulation for the peace of the Far East and Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo." Japan and Russia should resolve various pending issues before this friendly atmosphere dissipates, using effective methods, starting with the easy issues and gradually moving into the difficult ones. The Russian envoy replied that his government expressed sympathy for the Foreign Minister's views and hoped that both sides would resolve the pending issues in a spirit of mutual concession. As a result, the two countries first began negotiations on the extension of the pilot mining rights for oil in northern Sakhalin, and gradually discussed the issues of the Border Dispute Mediation Committee and the revision of the Fisheries Treaty. (Japan Associated Press dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Department expressed the following opinion on the conclusion of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway: Although the Russian-"Manchukuo" dispute over the railway can be eliminated as a result of the sale, if Soviet Russia does not abandon its ambition for the Far East, it will inevitably make greater efforts to consolidate its borders. Therefore, unless Soviet Russia has sincerity, the conclusion of this negotiation will not have much effect on the easing of Japanese-Russian relations. (China United Press dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Contents of the Russian Puppet Protocol</p>
<p>(Moscow) TASS learned from the authorities that the documents for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway were signed today, including the Soviet-"Manchukuo" contract, the Soviet-Japanese-"Manchukuo" triangular protocol, and various official documents that must be exchanged between the Soviet and Japanese governments regarding the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>The main points of the Soviet-"Manchukuo" contract are as follows: The preamble states that the purpose of this contract is to promote peace in the Far East and stipulates that the "Manchukuo" government shall pay 140 million yen (excluding the Soviet employees' retirement fund of about 30 million yen). The Soviet Union will transfer all its rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchukuo." One-third of this amount, 46.67 million yen, must be paid in cash. Of this, 23.33 million yen must be paid as soon as the contract is signed. The remaining half will be repaid by the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Finance in four installments over three years, each installment being of equal amount, with an annual interest rate of 3%. The contract stipulates the so-called "gold reservation item," that is, if the exchange rate of the yen continues to fall, the amount received by the Soviet Union must also be increased proportionally. The remaining two-thirds of the total amount, 93.33 million yen, will be paid by Japanese-"Manchukuo" commercial institutions according to the Soviet trade delegation's orders in Japan within three years. The price of these goods is stipulated to be paid by the "Manchukuo" Embassy in Japan through the Bank of Japan. After formally signing this contract, "Manchukuo" will be the owner and operator of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The contract also stipulates the procedures for the transfer of the railway's assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Another part of the contract stipulates the protection of the Soviet employees of the railway, that is, all Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway who are dismissed by the new Manchukuo administration can receive their full salary in accordance with the current regulations of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They can also resolve all their financial issues with the railway, receive subsidies, and so on. The contract also stipulates that there shall be no mutual disputes over property rights between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Soviet Railway. At the same time, an agreement is specially concluded to resolve the passenger and freight traffic between the Soviet and Manchukuo railways. The clauses listed in the Soviet-Japanese-"Manchukuo" triangular protocol stipulate that the Soviet trade delegation must order goods from Japanese-"Manchukuo" merchants under normal conditions. If there are any disputes between the Soviet trade delegation and Japanese-"Manchukuo" merchants, a special mediation committee will be established to resolve them. The committee will have four members, including two representatives from the Soviet Union and one each from Japan and Manchukuo.</p>
<p>When signing the contract, the Japanese government must hand over to the Soviet Embassy a document guaranteeing the cash and goods to be paid to the Soviet Union for the Soviet Union's abandonment of its rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Japanese government will also use a document to guarantee that all payments must be made to the Soviet Union. The contract will take effect from the date of formal signing.

<p>Disposition of the Shanghai Property Is About to Happen</p>
<p>It is learned that the East China Railway Wharf at Yangjiadu in Shanghai covers an area of about 20 Chinese acres and is located between the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. wharf and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's West Wharf. There are also warehouses and the real estate of the railway's Shanghai office on Sichuan Road, which are also worth more than one million yuan. According to the agreement signed this time, all rights to the Eastern Railway's various affiliated enterprises and properties will be transferred to the management of the puppet organization, and the South Manchuria Railway will inherit the Eastern Railway's operating rights. Therefore, it has been decided to accept the Yangjiadu wharf and the office building on Sichuan Road in this port. The authorities of the office recently registered the wharf's real estate with the US consulate in this port. The transfer of the wharf and real estate may cause problems. (News Agency)</p>

This is the initial step for the "Manchukuo" side to employ White Russians when taking over the railway. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Japan's Economic Status Becomes More Consolidated</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the conclusion of the negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, all parties have high expectations for the economic development of northern Manchuria in the future. The good effects expected by "Manchukuo" after accepting this railway are roughly as follows: (1) Soviet-affiliated investments along the line of approximately 100 million yuan will inevitably be driven out by the entry of Japanese and "Manchukuo" capital in the future; (2) The Soviet Union's power over the forestry and mining industries has already declined, and Japanese and "Manchukuo" enterprises can replace it; (3) Railway staff in the interior of South Manchuria Railway will have a new world to operate in; (4) Due to the unified operation of the entire Manchurian railway, freight rates can be reduced, and cargo transportation will also be rationalized; (5) There will be no more cargo transported to Vladivostok, which will be concentrated in Dalian and North Korea; (6) The purchase of special products from northern Manchuria can be simplified, which, combined with the rationalization of transportation, can dispose of the stagnant goods in Harbin and increase commercial transactions; (7) Japanese goods can be sold smoothly in the area along the line in the future.

<h3>Full Text of Illegal Agreement on the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>News Agency reports that the Soviet Union illegally sold the Chinese Eastern Railway. The draft agreement was signed at 9 PM on the 11th. This matter is currently undergoing formal negotiations from our side to Russia. How the outcome of future negotiations will proceed remains uncertain. The full text of the draft agreement is now obtained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Items to be sold: the Chinese Eastern Railway and all its affiliated assets. (1) (A) The railway's total length is 1,726 kilometers, being the trunk line between Manchouli, Suifenhe, and Changchun. (B) 2,544 kilometers are for business lines, 2,567 kilometers for telephone water supply equipment and telegraph lines. (1) All locomotives and freight cars owned by the railway.

(8) Period of takeover: After signing the agreement, all rights will be officially taken over at the same time. (9) Dismissal severance pay and allowances for Soviet staff: A. When dismissing Soviet railway staff, notice must be given three months in advance.

<h3>New York Cotton Market Plunge</h3>
<p>Due to Misunderstanding of Bankhead Amendment Government Control Plan Still Uncertain</p>
<p>(New York) The New York cotton market was extremely panicked today under the great pressure of selling, causing the price of cotton per bale to plummet by more than five dollars. The stock market was affected by this, with prices falling by two dollars. The Chicago wheat market was also affected, with prices falling by two cents. The reason for the cotton market's instability is that the government's plan to control new cotton production is still uncertain. The government decided that farmers producing less than two bales of cotton would not be subject to the Bankhead Cotton Acreage Control Act. This move also shook the cotton market's confidence, as it could render the control plan ineffective. All parties were dumping large quantities of cotton into the market. Senator Bankhead stated that the amendment to the Cotton Acreage Control Act could not increase the total amount of new cotton production to more than ten million five hundred thousand bales. He supports stockpiling five million bales and not selling them on the market. After this statement was made, the price drop temporarily subsided, but the market situation was still not stable. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Smith stated today that, in view of the sharp drop in New York cotton market prices, he will urge the House to prepone that the government stockpile at least five million five hundred thousand bales of cotton until prices rise and export trade recovers, and then may sell. He argues that the cotton stockpiled by the government should not be used for offsetting debts, nor should it be sold before December 1, 1936. If necessary, he will advocate stockpiling more than five million five hundred thousand bales, as this is a practical objective that Congress can control. People in the cotton industry should now know that Congress definitely intends to accomplish this. Bureau of Agriculture Director Davis IV stated that the policy of the cotton farmers' public accumulation agency has not interfered with the market, and the government has no intention of abandoning the cotton field loan program. Officials are not paying much attention to today's cotton market price drop, believing that even if farmers are now selling cotton, the amount is very small, so farmers are not greatly affected. The reason for this price drop is due to the misunderstanding of the Bankhead Cotton Amendment by people in the cotton industry. The amendment advocates that farmers producing less than two bales of cotton should be exempt from taxes, while the government's March regulations only apply to landlords. Whether this type of amendment can pass is still questionable. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Great Debate Expansion of National Defense Plan Baldwin Defends with Eloquent Words Labor Party Impeachment Motion Defeated by Majority Many Women Distribute Pro-Peace Leaflets</h3>
<p>(London) The Labor Party's motion to impeach the government, opposing the government's policy of expanding military strength, resulting in an increase of ten million fifty-three thousand nine hundred pounds in this year's net expenditure, was rejected by a majority in the House of Commons tonight. The Labor Party only received seventy-nine votes, while those opposing the motion numbered four hundred and twenty-four. This debate, which has attracted international attention, had many spectators, and many nobles were seated in the special viewing gallery, listening attentively. The French, Belgian, Turkish ambassadors, and the German embassy counselor were also among them. During the heat of the debate, an unexpected interjection occurred. Many women threw leaflets advocating peace from the viewing gallery. Pieces of paper flew around, scattering throughout the venue. These people also loudly criticized the White Paper on National Defense, and were immediately escorted out by the parliamentary police. Soon after, several more women in the viewing gallery performed the same antics and were also expelled. At the same time, two hundred people, mostly women, gathered in the outer room of the parliament, intending to see the members of parliament in order to oppose the government's policy. Fortunately, security was tight, and no incident occurred. Amidst the sound of debate, there were also noises of contention. Labor Party member Attlee moved to impeach the government, stating that the White Paper denies the League of Nations, destroys the League of Nations' fundamental principles, making it impossible for the League of Nations to be effective, and also that the White Paper is causing an arms race, frightening the world. When the mover spoke, government party members shouted "Nonsense!" in response. The subject of debate was a military expenditure budget estimate, which differed from those previously proposed by members, and this budget estimate was being discussed for the first time, so tonight's debate was particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Labor Party Impeachment Denounced as Nonsense</p>
<p>The impeachment motion asks the House of Commons to express its opinion on whether the government's national defense policy is completely contrary to (1) the spirit of establishing collective world peace by creating the League of Nations, (2) hindering the atmosphere for the establishment of an arms reduction convention, (3) leading to international competition and insecurity, and brewing war. Attlee claimed that when Foreign Secretary Simon was preparing to have friendly talks with Germany, the government unexpectedly published the White Paper on National Defense, angering Germany, which was regrettable. The government seems to have never supported other countries' arms reduction plans. The Labor Party always detests any form of military action, domestic or otherwise. The White Paper clearly indicates a complete change in Britain, returning to the atmosphere of alliances against enemies and the arms race in the skies before the European War. Government party members loudly denounced it as "nonsense."</p>
<p>Baldwin on the Status of the League of Nations</p>
<p>Privy Council President Baldwin stood up to reply, speaking very movingly, saying that the democratic government has stated in the White Paper what it considers to be the truth of democracy. In the past, there have often been major crises unfavorable to democracy because the leaders of democratic governments did not reveal truths that people did not want to hear. It is not true that the British government has only paid lip service to the League of Nations. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, any statesman of any political party in Britain has always done their best to support the League of Nations at all times under very difficult circumstances and against the opposition of countries that have already withdrawn from the organization. The British government is still determined to work for the future in the League of Nations, but people are prone to forget when talking about collective security and sanctions that the membership of the League of Nations is not universal, so the collective system is not complete. Two major countries have now announced their withdrawal, dealing a major blow to the collective system. In addition, there is another major country that has never assumed the obligations of the League of Nations. The British government earnestly hopes for the universalization of the League of Nations, and for this reason, welcomes the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations, and has always strived to persuade Germany to withdraw its withdrawal notice. It must be known that in international politics, one does not do what is ideally the best, but what is best in the existing environment. The government is not now proposing to expand its military strength, but merely proceeding with the air force expansion that was debated last summer. What it is requesting is that once all its forces must resist an aggressor or fulfill obligations under the convention, it should be as well-equipped as possible.</p>
<p>White Paper Not Aimed at Germany</p>
<p>Baldwin mentioned the joint communiqué issued after the British-French talks in London, saying that the direct and effective cooperation with Germany mentioned in the communiqué is of particular importance in the view of the British and French governments, hence the arrangement for Simon to visit Berlin. The visit to Berlin should be realized in about half a month. Each party has its own desires in this kind of event. There are countries that wish to amend existing treaties, and there are countries that are asked to agree to these amendments. No one can blame the former if they wish to slightly change the status quo, but what can be reasonably requested is that the changes they desire should be accompanied by the safeguards necessary for peace and security. Some parties believe that the White Paper is only aimed at Germany, which is not true. However, what the White Paper says is essentially the same as the remarks he made last November with general agreement. These remarks, made in a friendly spirit and with genuine understanding, are the best and only effective prelude to any negotiation, and the trust that, without candor and genuineness, the beginning of an effective agreement is impossible, let alone the ending. He hopes that the government can now handle things seriously.</p>
<p>Franco-Italian Negotiations Open a New Era</p>
<p>If the negotiations that have already begun in Paris and Rome continue to be conducted in other capitals, there is no reason to say that they cannot create a new era for Europe. The British government is watching the continuation of these negotiations and is prepared to make contributions, but the desire to create or expand false matters, or the effort to grasp the facts, will not be of any benefit.</p>
<p>Replenishing Armaments Only Seeking Equality</p>
<p>Baldwin responded to the claim that Britain's national defense plan would lead to other countries rearming, and pointed out the facts and figures of the already greatly increased military strength of other countries such as the United States, Japan, and Russia, saying that the United States has now built warships to the limits permitted by the treaty, while Britain has not yet done so. The US naval budget has increased from 350,000,000 yuan in 1933 to 492,000,000 yuan in 1935, and the increase in 1936 is even greater, reaching 580,000,000 yuan. From these figures, it can be seen that even under the constraints of the treaty, Britain now feels that its military strength has not enabled Britain to achieve equality. Baldwin went on to mention the Franco-Italian navies, saying that while other countries are building various weapons at an alarming rate, Britain has not increased its army or navy. If a new agreement on warships cannot be established, the replenishment of British warships will soon become a critical issue. British warships need the latest equipment and protection against aircraft in many ways, which the United States and Japan are already rapidly doing. The British army is not fully prepared for large-scale military operations, and the British air force still ranks fifth among the world's air forces. Even today, Britain does not want to compete with the largest air force, but only wants to maintain its equal status with strong countries that are slightly closer in distance.</p>
<p>Air Force Convention Aims to Ensure Security</p>
<p>Many of today's disappointments arise from the issue of status. Britain must pay attention to this matter in future discussions. Many countries are now adopting the major plan of mobilizing the entire nation once war breaks out. Britain has never been a leader in rearmament. All of Britain's air force still ranks fifth. In addition to defense equipment against aircraft, it has not increased its army or navy strength. Britain cannot guarantee itself against air strikes, but can make air strikes more difficult. This is the aim of the air convention that has been submitted. In any case, air strikes must be made worthless anywhere in Europe. The policy stated in the White Paper is not only harmless to peace, but can also make future peace more secure. We must all hope that our representatives who will travel to the capitals of Europe in the next two or three weeks will work smoothly, and that the security we are striving for will be realized soon.</p>
<p>Simon Continued to End the Debate</p>
<p>Samuel, a leader of a portion of the Liberal Party, claimed that the British government is now beginning an arms race, and that competition will have no end except for bankruptcy and war. Foreign Secretary Simon rose to end the debate, saying that he stated with the full agreement of the government that British policy is entirely based on membership of the League of Nations. Britain does not want to restore the methods that existed before the collective system was established. The most important aim of the current negotiations is to seek conditions under which Germany can rejoin the League of Nations. We firmly believe that there is no world guarantee that can rival the effective work of a genuine and universal League of Nations. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain then put forward his amended answer, which read: "The House of Commons is loyal to Britain's obligations as a member of the League, and is willing to limit armaments through international compromise, while acknowledging that this goal cannot be achieved through unilateral disarmament. It now approves the government's policy, recognizing that there is an equal need to protect the people and fulfill international obligations.</p>
<p>Clearly Respond to Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>The former Foreign Secretary said that the League of Nations can certainly provide great protection against occasional wars, but there is no guarantee against the aggression of countries that deliberately wage war to achieve their ambitions. To prevent this kind of war, the only way is to clearly indicate to this aggressor nation that it will be met with overwhelming force, so that it cannot have any hope of victory. The Locarno Treaty, the Eastern European Pact, and other local agreements all take this as their policy, and have become effective methods for consolidating the collective system.</p>
<p>Glimpse of the Contents of the White Paper</p>
<p>As for the content of the White Paper, the responsibility of the House of Commons is to announce to the people of the country that the sacrifices required by the White Paper are necessary for Britain's national defense and the fulfillment of its obligations as a member of the League of Nations. The important figures in Britain's defense budget estimate are as follows: the Air Force will increase by forty-one and a half squadrons by the end of 1938, with an increase in expenditure of £3,089,000, totaling £20,650,000.</p>
<p>The Army will increase by 2,700 men, totaling 152,200 men, with an increase in expenditure of £3,950,000 over the previous year, totaling £43,500,000.</p>
<p>Naval expenditure will increase by £3,500,000 over the previous year, totaling £60,050,000, with an increase of 2,000 personnel. The warship construction program includes three cruisers, one leader ship, eight destroyers, three submarines, one submarine supply ship, four supply ships, one survey ship, and seven small warships.

<h3>Greek Civil Strife Suppressed Rebel Leaders Flee to Italy and Bulgaria Order Gradually Restored in Various Places</h3>
<p>Athens Prime Minister Tsaldaris recently declared to the press, "After the rebels in northern Macedonia and Thrace were eliminated, government agencies have all been restored to their posts. The rebels have fled in droves, taking away the contents of local treasuries." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens This afternoon, government forces captured Kavala, Drama, and Thessaloniki. All three places are strategically important. The rebels, having lost them, will have no way to resist. It is expected that they will completely collapse within seventy-two hours. Rebel leaders such as General Kamenos have fled to safe places. According to a Reuters report from Sofia, General Kamenos led seventy-two staff officers and crossed the border into Bulgaria this afternoon, taking refuge south of Mastanli. Macedonia and Serres are now declared clear. The rebels on land have been bombed by aircraft and have already surrendered. The authorities now believe that the rebel ships will also surrender within a few days. Government forces marched in and occupied Serres. General Kaminos, seeing that his troops had no will to fight, fled to Alexandroupolis with several staff officers. Upon hearing that the area had also surrendered, he hurriedly turned back. Government officials in various cities in Macedonia and Serres have resumed normal administration. The government has ordered that the rebel leaders captured in the battle will be tried by military tribunals. Prime Minister Tsaldaris told a Reuters interviewer today that once the rebellion is suppressed, a new era for Greece will begin. According to a Reuters report from San Remo, General Plastiras, the mastermind of this rebellion, attempted to cross the border into Italy near Bordighera in Italy today, but was stopped by the Italian authorities and returned to Genoa. It is reported that before abandoning Serres, the rebels looted the local Greek bank, taking away 80 million Greek coins. Before attacking Serres, government forces heavily bombed it with artillery, and then advanced through the snow. After a brief but intense battle, the rebels were defeated. The enemy's morale was greatly reduced, thousands surrendered, and hundreds fled into Bulgaria. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Leaders Flee Venizelos Arrives on Italian Island</h3>
<p>Sofia The rebel commander Kammena, who commanded the fighting in the Macedonian sector, and eighteen officers and the Governor of Serres Province retreated into the Bulgarian border this afternoon, where they were disarmed by the Bulgarian border guards. The commander said that the entire army was defeated due to a mutiny of the soldiers. It is reported that the chief of staff of the rebel Fourth Army Corps has committed suicide. Government forces Commander-in-Chief Kontylis, seeing that the fighting in the Macedonian sector has come to an end, will return to Athens by plane tomorrow morning. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens According to unconfirmed but reliable sources, former Prime Minister Venizelos, Naval Admiral Dimitrios, former Finance Minister Maris, and many other rebel leaders have boarded the Averoff cruiser and left Crete with their followers. It is also reported that after escorting the rebel leaders to a safe location, the ship will return and be at the disposal of the government. Crete Governor Apotsokidis, who had been detained by the rebels, has now been released and has restored all civil servants to their original positions. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens Mr. and Mrs. Venizelos and sixty officers are reported to have landed in Dutenes, Kasos Island, Italy, today. His ship then sailed back to Greece, preparing to surrender to the government. Mr. Venizelos is seventy-one years old this year and is the "father of the nation" of the Republic of Greece, having unified the country and expanded its territory, but he still cannot avoid fleeing to other countries. The government has not yet announced what action it will take against Mrs. Venizelos, who is wealthy, but said that it has been discovered that Mrs. Venizelos has funded the revolution and purchased weapons for the rebels. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens The government has recently requested the Bulgarian government to extradite the rebel officers. According to news from the Tetovo district, a battalion of rebels planned to escape by train, but was disarmed. In addition, Serres rebel commander Brigadier General Ranatopoulos, along with five staff officers, escaped in a sailboat equipped with a motor and disappeared without a trace. Minister of Cabinet Metaxas replied to journalists that if a foreign country intervenes to mediate the unrest, the Greek government considers it an unfriendly act. All countries agree with the Greek government's view that there should be no intervention. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>European Air Force Convention Goering Indicates Willingness to Participate Simon to Decide Trip to Germany in Geneva</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The local newspapers all published extensively Prussian Governor Goering's remarks to Daily Mail reporter Old Bleitz, and paid particular attention to Goering's statement that while the German Air Force will defend the motherland and will not retreat even a single soldier, it will never threaten the peace of other countries. As for the British-French invitation for Germany to participate in the Air Force Convention, Goering expressed that Germany is happy to accept it in order to jointly maintain peace. Goering also explained the distinction between Germany's military and civilian aviation, saying that it can be known from the different badges of aviation personnel. However, Germany's military aviation is directly under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Aviation. Although Goering's words did not explicitly state the strength of the German Air Force, the world should generally recognize that Germany must have an air force to protect the entire country, which is undoubtedly the intention. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Privy Council President Baldwin stated in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Simon's planned trip to Berlin has been delayed, but it is expected to take place within two weeks. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail diplomatic correspondent cabled that the date of British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin can be decided within one or two days. According to diplomatic sources, the British Foreign Secretary hopes to travel between March 24 and 30, so his trip may take place before Lord Privy Seal Eden goes to Moscow. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today, saying that if the British-German talks are delayed for so long, or even break down, it will allow those who advocate a detached policy to gain a victory, and will cause irreparable damage to Europe's collective security. As seen by The Times, the current situation is approaching a critical point, because giving Germany equal treatment is a generally agreed strategy, and it is imperative. Since the British government has recognized this, it should be clear that the restrictions on Germany's military strength in the Treaty of Versailles have become a thing of the past. Therefore, for the present, it should look to the future as soon as possible, and no longer be afraid of past discrimination. (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Note to Britain: Welcoming Eden to Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Foreign Ministry today sent a note to the British government, welcoming the Lord Privy Seal, Eden, to Moscow for Anglo-Russian negotiations. It is understood that Eden will soon come to Moscow to negotiate Soviet Russia's participation in the non-aggression pact for the air force and the disarmament convention recently proposed by Britain. Observers say that the British side intends to persuade Soviet Russia to reduce its Western military strength to dispel Germany's fears, because Hitler insists on revitalizing armaments because he believes that the increasing strength of the Soviet Russian army and air force is sufficient to threaten Germany. If Eden can accomplish his mission and make Soviet Russia agree to disarmament, then Germany should be able to make corresponding concessions, so that Britain and France can also reduce their army and air force. If so, European peace can be expected, and the people's taxes can also be reduced. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Severe Internal Turmoil in Cuba: Capital Announces State of War, Law of Shooting Imprisoned Resurrected, U.S. Maintains Non-Interference Stance</h3>
<p>Havana. The cabinet officially announced a state of war. Cuba has become a world of terror today. The barbaric law of killing prisoners, which has long been abolished, has also been resurrected, that is, releasing the prisoners, ordering them to run quickly, and then shooting them from behind. It is understood that six people were executed by the government army in this way last night. The entire national economic undertaking has been completely halted. President Madi Tate ordered, under the dictatorship of Chag, that all people accused of being related to strikes and riots should be tried by military law, and the right to be tried by ordinary courts should be abolished. The national strike wave has reached its peak. Armed troops coming and going in the streets have further heightened the arrogance of the strike. Military officers ordered soldiers not to be lenient to strikers, and if there is resistance, they can be killed without mercy. However, although the laws are strict, the throwing of bombs has not stopped. The law of shooting prisoners has also failed to arouse the people's fear. Observers believe that this kind of action will only make the revolutionary movement more enthusiastic. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department announced that the United States does not intend to interfere in the turmoil in Cuba, because it has not received any reports of danger to the lives and property of American expatriates. The State Department spokesman said that if there is no danger to the lives of American expatriates, the internal turmoil of the Republic of Cuba has nothing to do with the United States, because the Platt Amendment has recently been abolished. However, the government is paying close attention to the situation in Cuba. It is said that the diplomatic representative stationed in Havana must report by telegram almost every hour.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Shizeng said that he came here to participate in the anniversary of the death of the Premier and to visit friends in Beijing. When Wang Chonghui went abroad, he entrusted him to continue promoting unity, but in fact, unity had already been achieved and there was no need to promote it again. Regarding the rumor that Xiao Yu stole treasures and transported them abroad, and was detained by the Marseilles Customs, he had not heard of such an incident overseas. The "University Free City" for participation in the construction of Paris was submitted to the Central Political Council, and funding needs to be discussed. The Free City is of an international nature, and the location has been determined. Governments of various countries are free to invest and participate, and China is also one of the units.

<h3>Chen Gongbo Discusses the Issue of Aiding Industries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo said that the requests from all sectors of Shanghai for assistance to the market, regarding lending and economic aspects, are currently being planned by the Ministry of Finance and Kong Xiangxi. The Ministry of Industry is devoted to studying fundamental solutions. There are many reasons for the decline of Chinese industry and commerce. What is currently manifested is economic hardship and excessive trade deficits. Although there are many relief measures, they will definitely not be achieved overnight. The Ministry deeply feels that to start relief, it must explore the root cause, so it has decided to first conduct a detailed investigation of the names and quantities of imported foreign goods and exported domestic goods, and analyze one by one the points that should be improved in the export of domestic goods. This work is being investigated by the International Trade Bureau on the one hand, and the Ministry is coordinating the entire improvement plan on the other hand. As for the plan to aid industry and commerce, the Ministry will first start from prosperous industrial and commercial areas and plan relief through industrial and commercial cooperation as a fundamental plan. Chen laughed at the external rumors that the Ministry of Industry advocated implementing control over the relief of industry and commerce, saying that the name of control is very new, but unfortunately the general production and sales situation has not yet been clarified, and the nascent industry and commerce of China are not yet at that point.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Resolves to Block the Yellow River Breach</h3>
<p>Yellow River Water Rises, Previous Efforts Wasted, Changyuan County Seat Imminent Submergence</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Since the dismantling of the Yellow River Aftermath Project Office in southern Hebei last year, the Yellow River breach closure project has been the responsibility of Hua Deming, Director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, assisted by Zhang Qinglu, the magistrate of Changyuan County, to carry out the Guantaigou breach closure project. After eight months, the project has not yet been completed. There was news last month that the Changyuan breach would be closed, but recently, the Yellow River's main current shifted north, scouring the embankment, and the breach reopened, widening to over 45 meters. The Jinmen area is overflowing with water, the current is turbulent, the Taihang embankment is being severely eroded and is also in danger. The water level at the breach has gradually risen from 18 meters. As of today, due to the current slowing in the morning and accelerating at night, the difference in depth between morning and evening is several meters. The east dam is 21.3 meters deep in the morning and rises to 24.5 meters in the evening. The west dam is 20.7 meters deep in the morning and rises to 22.6 meters in the evening. The sides of the embankments are collapsing and being washed away by the current. The ropes used for binding are being battered by the huge waves, breaking nineteen times. In the middle of the night, the ropes snap with a sound like thunder. River officials and Changyuan County officials have supervised six to seven hundred laborers, employees, and soldiers, working day and night to protect the area, but everything they block is washed away. It is found that the Guantaigou project, which was already more than halfway complete, has now been completely wasted. The Changyuan County seat has been surrounded by water for eighteen months. Only one main street in the city remains unflooded. Now, due to the rising water, the water outside the city is 18 meters deep, and inside the city it is about 8 meters deep. Only half a brick of the city wall remains visible above the water. People rely on boats for transportation. Now that the spring flood season is approaching, the Yellow River water is rising and not receding. The submersion of the entire city is imminent. The disaster victims of the county will send representatives to the provincial capital to appeal for the rapid closure of the breach to save hundreds of thousands of lives. County Magistrate Zhang Qinglu has also telegraphed the province, reporting that the city walls are about to be submerged, and the entire county will be flooded imminently. He requests permission to relocate the county seat to another town, or else to continue to work on boats as in the worst of the floods in previous years. The provincial government is considering this and has not yet replied. Hu Yuanhui, Director of the Construction Department, rushed to the construction site before the lunar New Year due to the urgency of the breach closure project and has been stationed there for two months. The provincial government has repeatedly received his telegrams for help and has successively allocated 50,000 yuan for the project and 20,000 sacks for the closure. At the same time, 8,800 yuan were allocated to Changyuan County, with 5,000 yuan for reinforcing the Taihang embankment and 3,800 yuan for protecting the county seat. However, all efforts have failed. Recently, it was heard that Hu Yuanhui's opinions differ from those of Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Engineering and Relief Group of the Central Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, and Hu is considering leaving the construction site and returning to the province. The provincial government believes that with the spring flood season approaching, this is a critical moment and should not allow anyone to be passive. Therefore, it telegraphed Chairman Yu Xuezhong in Beijing to report the situation. Yu telegraphed back yesterday. Although the original text did not explicitly comfort Hu, it encouraged the personnel at the construction site to work hard. The telegram reads as follows: "The Central Government has sent Vice Minister Fu Rulin to the construction site to supervise the closure. It is scheduled to depart from Beijing on the evening of the 9th. The current situation is extremely critical. For the sake of its duty, the Hebei Provincial Government has no room for shirking responsibility and must do its utmost to block the breach and quickly formulate a plan. All funds needed for the breach closure project will be borne by the Ministry, as clearly stated by the Central Government, and the Central Political Council has approved the raising of necessary funds. The Council has also been ordered to consult with the Ministry of Finance on relief measures. Therefore, the funding issue can be said to be no problem. If a firm decision is not made at this time and measures are not quickly taken, it will not only fail to live up to the Central Government, but also to the people. I believe that we must be responsible to the end no matter what. Please tell Brother Haimen (Hu Yuanhui) to overcome the difficulties. We are anxiously waiting." (11th)</p>

It has been open for many years, is large in scale, and its business is one of the largest among oil factories. But at 0:30 this morning (the 12th), a fire suddenly broke out. Because it was all oil-related flammable materials, it spread extremely quickly. By the time the fire brigades from various districts arrived, it was difficult to extinguish due to the inconvenience of water supply. Except for the forward engine room, which was unscathed, the remaining hundred or so factory buildings were reduced to ashes. The thatched sheds outside the back door of the factory and the Jiangnan Ice Factory across the river were also burned down. The loss is estimated to be over 100,000 yuan. The fire was not extinguished until dawn.</p>

Because he feels that handling the matter is difficult, he has repeatedly submitted his resignation to Zhai Yifu, the county magistrate and chairman of the committee. Because Gu is capable, Zhai has always comforted and encouraged him. Recently, Gu has insisted on resigning again. The county magistrate has not yet expressed his opinion.</p>

<h3>Tenth Anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's Death</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Held a Memorial Meeting Yesterday, and the Municipal Government Held a Tree Planting Ceremony</p>
<p>Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen. The Municipal Party Headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life at 10 AM in the auditorium of the headquarters to hold a memorial meeting. At the same time, the Municipal Government held a tree-planting ceremony in the city center. Central News Agency reporters specially recorded the events as follows:</p>
<p>Memorial Meeting: The memorial meeting was held at 10 AM in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Representatives from various district party headquarters, district sub-headquarters, representatives from various bureaus of the municipal government, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Defense Corps, the Ordnance Factory, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various trade unions, the First and Second Special District Courts, Dongwu Law School, the National Public School, Zhengfeng College, Patriotic Girls' School, Minli Middle School, Huadong Middle School, and the entire staff of the Labor Movement Training Institute, totaling over seventy organizations, participated, with approximately two hundred attendees. Cai Hongtian presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Order of the Meeting: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the party anthem; (3) Bow three times to the national flag and the portrait of Premier Sun; (4) The chairman respectfully reads Premier Sun's will; (5) Silent tribute; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Slogans; (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Cai Hongtian reported, stating that today is the tenth anniversary of the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen in Beijing. While in mourning, we should not only commemorate the great spirit of the Premier but also strive to complete the revolutionary cause. The Premier was the founder of the Party and the state, and the mentor of the revolution. Our commemoration can be divided into three phases: (1) During the Premier's lifetime, the Premier devoted his entire life to the revolutionary cause. From a young age, he aspired to overthrow the Manchu Qing government. As he grew older, he strived with an indomitable spirit to establish the Republic of China and achieve freedom and equality as his responsibility. For forty years, he maintained his fearless spirit, which is truly admirable. (2) The Premier's will includes all revolutionary methods and points out the path to revolution in great detail, such as awakening the masses and uniting with all the nations of the world that treat us as equals to fight together, and instructs us to continue our efforts in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, the National Construction Program, and the Outline of National Construction to thoroughly complete the task. (3) After the Premier's death, the Premier's death was a great loss to our country, and we have still not completed the revolution to this day. However, the entire population and military and political leaders have deeply realized that the Three Principles of the People is the only magic weapon for building China. In addition to vowing allegiance to the Party and the state, there is no other way to consolidate the foundation of the state. Therefore, we are willing to unanimously support the Party and the state, assist the government, because the Three Principles of the People can make the country prosperous, seek common welfare, and provide equality and freedom, and increase production and construction internally, quell external troubles, and abolish unequal treaties. I hope that everyone will work hard and move forward on the right track to comfort his spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>Commemorative Slogans: After the chairman's report, everyone shouted slogans and then announced the adjournment. The slogans are as follows: (1) Inherit Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit; (2) Complete Premier Sun's revolutionary cause; (3) Implement Premier Sun's teachings; (4) Step up production and construction; (5) Complete local autonomy; (6) Strengthen the Party's organization; (7) Premier Sun's spirit is immortal; (8) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (9) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Tree Planting Ceremony: Various Party, government, and military organizations in the city held a tree-planting ceremony at 9 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Government in the city center. Participants included Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, Director Yang Xiaotian, Director Wu Xingya, Director Cai Zengji, Director Pan Gongzhan, Standing Committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters Tong Xingbai, Zhou Xianzhang of the Naval Headquarters, Cai Ren of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Lu Youchang of the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, section chiefs, secretaries, and staff members of various bureaus and offices under the Municipal Government, teachers and students from various schools, and representatives from various organizations, totaling over a thousand people. After the music played and the meeting was opened and the ceremony was performed, Mayor Wu gave a report, followed by speeches by Tong Xingbai, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wu Xingya, director of the Social Affairs Bureau. Mayor Wu then led the participants to take a photo in front of the steps, and then to the third branch of the Municipal Garden on Fudongqian Road to plant trees.</p>
<p>Mayor's Report: Mayor Wu said in his report that today is the day to commemorate the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen, and it is also Arbor Day. We hold these ceremonies every year. The Premier's great personality and fearless spirit created a great revolutionary cause for the country and the nation. This is our everlasting model. When we commemorate such a great figure, we should of course have a very concrete and practical movement to express our sincere commemorative psychology. The so-called Arbor Day is to promote a movement of afforestation. Afforestation is a basic construction of the national economy, because forests are closely related to our national economy and people's livelihood. Our needs in life, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, are all directly related to forests. If we want to revitalize the Chinese countryside, to have a foundation for China's economic construction, and to ensure that the supply of necessities for the Chinese people is not difficult, then we cannot ignore this afforestation movement. Therefore, we also hold a tree-planting ceremony on the day of commemorating the death of Premier Sun, so that the Premier's greatness can be continued, endlessly, and not be ignored by our nation. This is the tenth anniversary of Premier Sun's death, and in each year's commemoration, we feel that its meaning is different. The Premier's great personality and great cause are not only a model for our Chinese nation for all generations, but also his life of hardship, struggling for the country and the nation, and fighting against the autocratic monarchs and warlord politicians of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, lasted for decades. Although there were more than ten failures, he continued to work hard until the last moment of his death, shouting the遗言 of "peace," "struggle," and "save China." This is a spirit that we, who are responsible for building the country, cannot forget for a moment, and we will surely succeed. In the past ten years, can our surviving comrades and compatriots across the country inherit his spirit, complete his cause, and realize his principles, after Premier Sun's forty years of struggle? This is something we should reflect on. Looking around at the current environment, the crisis of the country and the nation's destiny cannot but make us alarmed, so we should make such a resolution to do ten days' work in one day, one month's work in ten days, one year's work in one month, and ten years' work in one year. We, with a spirit of hard work and straightforwardness, will catch up head-on, and in this way, we can achieve success in our personal careers, as well as in the careers of the country and society. We must recognize that the Premier's great personality, fearless spirit, and spirit of fighting for the nation and the country are the work of saving the country and preserving its existence.</p>
<p>Speeches by Tong and Wu: Tong Xingbai then gave a speech, stating that today is the tenth anniversary of Premier Sun's death, and we are also holding a tree-planting ceremony. Mayor Wu has already reported in detail on the significance of tree planting, and I will not say more. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the relationship between the Premier Sun Memorial and tree planting. Why do we have these two actions on the day of the Premier Sun Memorial? Regarding our proclaiming the Premier's doctrine and his cause on this day, and encouraging us to inherit his spirit and complete his cause, this is a commemoration in terms of the spiritual aspect. In addition, we hold a tree-planting ceremony on this day, and we hold it every year. After twenty or thirty years, or even two or three hundred years, it can be said that the country's forests are all in memory of the Premier's death. This is a memorial expression in terms of the material aspect. We can have two feelings here. First, trees have the virtue of "timely revival." The growth, development, and prosperity of trees is a manifestation of nature, and we humans must also have this virtue of "timely revival." China has now reached a time of great danger, and international relations are also very dangerous. The suffering of people's livelihood in the country is also extremely urgent. Now the trees are reviving in time, and we should all work hard and be excited in time to save the nation and the country. Second, there are no useless trees. No matter how big or small, thick or thin, each has its use. This also shows us that we are a member of the nation, and we should all fulfill our responsibilities to the country and society and become a useful person. If there are people among us who cannot be self-reliant, then they are not as good as trees. Therefore, on this commemorative day, we should earnestly review ourselves and contribute all our abilities to the country and the nation. Finally, Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, stating that today we are commemorating the death of Premier Sun, and we cannot help but recall that when the Premier was dying, he was still issuing the calls for "peace," "struggle," and "save China." We feel that peace and struggle are based on the spirit of China's inherent kingly way, and saving China is also saving the world, because China's position is not only a center of gravity in East Asia, but also bears a great mission in the world. If China cannot be rich and strong, it will extend from the Far East to the world, and all will return to the Great Harmony. Therefore, we must not forget these seven words for a moment.</p>
<p>Tree Planting Situation: After the ceremony, Mayor Wu led the participants to walk to Fudongqian Road. Amidst the melodious sounds of military music, they entered the third branch of the Municipal Garden. First, Mayor Wu personally shoveled the soil and planted trees, followed by Secretary-General Yu, Director Yang, Director Wu, Committee Member Dong, and Director Pan. The trees planted by Mayor Wu were located in the center of the first row at the entrance. Secretary-General Yu, Director Yang, and Councilor Luo followed behind him, and the trees were arranged in a row. The other directors and the Jianghai Customs and other bureaus of the Municipal Party Headquarters were arranged on both sides. Various schools were located on both sides of the grassland in the back. The site was planted at 1:30 PM and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Tree Planting on Two Railways: The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and the special party department of the two railways jointly held a memorial ceremony for the tenth anniversary of Premier Sun's death and a tree-planting ceremony at the Qingyanggang Railway Garden Hotel yesterday. Wu Shaozeng, the acting director of the railway administration, Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Song Chuanji, representatives of the special party department, and more than 100 section chiefs, deputy section chiefs, and comrades from the two railway party departments attended. At 8 AM, they took a special train prepared by the railway administration from Shanghai North Station, attached to the fourth Shanghai-Beijing express train. At 9:30 AM, they held a ceremony in the hotel, presented wreaths, and read a eulogy. Wu Shaozeng, the acting director, delivered a speech on behalf of the railway administration, stating that the Premier's life embodied the three immortal qualities of establishing virtue, establishing meritorious service, and establishing words. The Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution written by the Premier were profound and extensive, and were admired by both China and foreign countries. This was establishing words; hand-founding the Republic of China was establishing meritorious service; the establishment of virtue was so great that it cannot be described in words. The most important thing is the two points of universal love and integrity. The Premier sacrificed everything to save the country and the people, which is the manifestation of his spirit of universal love. When the Premier died, the only thing left in his home was books, which is the manifestation of his spirit of integrity. We commemorate the Premier by continuing the Premier's aspirations and learning from the Premier's character. Universal love and integrity are the basic conditions for being a person, and we must practice them personally and implement them practically. Integrity is a passive effort; as long as you restrain yourself, it is not difficult to achieve. Universal love is an active behavior; not only must you have the thought, but also the methods. For example, when we see passengers crowding, or someone encounters a disaster, we feel unbearable, and at the same time, we try our best to eliminate their crowding and eliminate their disaster. This is one aspect of universal love. The above two points are the most important, and I hope to encourage everyone to work together on them. At the end, he explained the significance of tree planting, and said that the designated planting this time is on both banks of Qingyanggang. Today opens the beginning, and in the future, it will be jointly promoted with the local authorities, in order to gradually popularize the river banks, and one day the green trees will provide a benefit to travelers. After the speech, they took a photo together, and then went to plant trees along the river. The trees were planted with peach and willow trees, planted in intervals, winding for over a mile. They did not return to Shanghai until 12:50 PM.</p>
<p>Business as Usual: Yesterday, all agencies, schools, factories, shops, and legal entities, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the memorial meeting for the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen convened by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the tree-planting ceremony of the Municipal Government, all continued to work as usual and did not take a holiday. The schools each convened meetings to report on the significance of the commemoration of Premier Sun's death and tree planting. The various organizations and schools lowered their flags to half-mast to express their condolences. Military and police agencies, such as the Emergency Defense Department, and the French Concession Police Department took a holiday to commemorate the day, as stipulated by the consul. Therefore, the criminal public prosecution case of the Second Special District Court was suspended yesterday due to the suspension of the Police Department. At 9 AM, Liang and Wang, the two presidents of the Senior Court and the Second Special Court, Zhao and Chen, the two chief inspectors, and other officials and staff led the inspection and held a memorial ceremony in the first courtroom auditorium. After completion, civil and criminal self-prosecution, civil and criminal appeals cases were still tried as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese Commemoration: The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy and the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai took a day off to commemorate the Premier.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Others Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Xu Tingyao, Yang Dezhao, Chen Diaoyuan, and Jing Tingyi took the night train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Envoy to Cuba, Ling Bing, Returns to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Return to His Ancestral Home in Gushi, Henan</p>
<p>Our country's envoy to Cuba, Mr. Ling Bing, returned to China on the 23rd of last month aboard the Japanese Empress. Yesterday afternoon, he arrived in Shanghai by the same ship, accompanied by his wife, son, and General Zhang Fakui. Mr. Ling told a Central News Agency reporter on board that he had been abroad for five years and had specifically requested leave to return home to visit family and attend to personal matters. Having left Cuba over a month ago, he was somewhat out of touch with the latest situation. The Cuban government has very good relations with our overseas Chinese, with no instances of oppression or expulsion. The Cuban people are the same, to the point of not distinguishing nationalities. However, the instability of their political situation has had some impact on various undertakings. There are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 overseas Chinese in Cuba. Recently, due to the global economic crisis, Cuba has inevitably been affected, causing larger-scale Chinese business operators to go bankrupt. Some, due to difficult living conditions, were forced to return to China, while others are waiting for opportunities to continue. Small-scale operators are still managing to barely maintain themselves. After reporting to Beijing, I will return to my ancestral home in Gushi, Henan, for a short stay to rest, he said.</p>
<h3>Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank Liquidation Office Opposes the Eastern Railway Deal</h3>
<p>Shiye She reports that the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway has attracted considerable attention from various countries. In addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructing our ambassador to Russia, Yan, to lodge a strong protest, the General Liquidation Office of the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank in this city has also expressed its firm opposition and will make a corresponding statement when the formal signing takes place. Yesterday was the date for Japan and Russia to hold the initialing ceremony. A Shiye She reporter specifically visited Mr. Yaldensky, the Russian advisor to the Daosheng Bank, to inquire about his views. According to him, this office, in any case, fundamentally cannot and will not recognize this illegal transaction between Japan and Russia. Therefore, this office had already sent formal statements to the Japanese Minister, Arimasa Akira, the Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, and the government authorities of both parties last month, requesting the preservation of all rights and interests related to the railway and refusing to accept any restrictions. Numerous letters were sent to both sides, but no response has been received. Currently, I am paying close attention to the cause and effect and the extent of the development of this transaction. It is not convenient to disclose at this time what forms of opposition will be taken. In summary, this office will definitely respond with effective measures. This office not only expresses sympathy for the Chinese government's opposition but is also willing to do its utmost to lead the way. Mr. Ya added that it may be possible to meet and discuss with the Russian ambassador, Mr. Bogomolov, when he comes to China at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Returned to China Yesterday, Arriving in Shanghai: Talks About How European and American Countries are All Striving to Become Stronger; Future Plans Not Yet Fully Decided</h3>
<p>General Zhang Fakui, having traveled around Europe and America and investigated various aspects of politics, economics, military affairs, and society in various countries for nearly three years, recently, having almost completed his travels in European and American countries, returned to China on the Japanese Empress from Canada on the 23rd of last month. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is staying at the New Asia Hotel. A Central News Agency reporter specially investigated the situation, as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Japanese Empress arrived at the Qichang Wharf at 5:30 PM yesterday. In advance, more than ten of Mr. Zhang's relatives and friends boarded the Jianghai Customs' small tugboat Jinghui to meet him at the Wusongkou. They also toured Donggou in Pudong while waiting. Only when the Japanese Empress approached did they join the ship. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang waved and tipped their hats to the welcomers on the ship, with great joy.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>The municipal government sent the Yue Shi ship, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a public security ship carrying the welcoming personnel. Those who boarded the ship to welcome him included Tang Shixuan, representing Mayor Wu, Yang Dezhao, representing Chen Jitang, Yang Hu, the director of the Municipal Security Department, Huang Jianping, representing Li Zongren, Yu Ming, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, He Zhuoxian, the director of the Trademark Bureau, and Mr. Zhang's relatives and friends, totaling over a hundred people. The Water Police Bureau also dispatched police to provide strict protection.</p>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was wearing a dark brown suit, a black woolen overcoat, and a dark gray hat. He appeared stronger and slightly more prosperous than when he left the country, with a radiant appearance. When the Japanese Empress docked, the welcoming personnel crowded onto the ship. Mr. Zhang greeted them warmly, full of energy. Accompanying him were Mr. Zhang's wife and Mr. and Mrs. Ling Bing, the envoy to Cuba. According to Mr. Zhang, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, after arriving in Shanghai, he will stay at the New Asia Hotel to rest. His future plans have not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang issued a written statement, outlining his journey, stating, "Since I resigned from my military position in October of the 21st year of the Republic [1932] and received government funding to travel abroad, nearly three years have passed in an instant. During this period, I traveled to over twenty countries in Europe and America, and what I have seen and heard is difficult to summarize in a single sentence. However, in general, although the political systems of various countries have differences, the sizes of their territories vary, and the strength of their national power differs, since the European War, all countries, aware of the tragedy of national subjugation, have shown a spirit of striving and possess a new atmosphere. Their patriotism and belief in national self-determination are particularly vigorous in all countries. The hard work of Turkey, the arduous struggle of Germany, the diligent governance of Italy, and the perfection of the naval, land, and air equipment of the strong countries of England, France, the United States, and Italy are all admirable. Observing the various backward conditions in our country, one cannot help but feel a chill. Therefore, I believe that if our country today wants to survive in this threatening and turbulent environment, the only way is to be united from top to bottom, to thoroughly awaken, to abandon selfish and self-serving ideas, to prioritize the country and the nation, and to work hard, so that in the future, national disasters may be slightly averted."</p>

<h3>Government and Banking Industries Prepare Credit Loans to Revive the Market</h3>
<p>A Total of 5 Million Yuan, Equally Assigned, Separate Meetings of Banking and Money Industries Associations</p>
<p>Xinsheng She reports that the Local Association, in order to revive the market, has, through a special committee's research, proposed that the government and the banking and money industries each contribute 2.5 million yuan, totaling 5 million yuan, to provide credit loans for industry and commerce. A syndicate will be organized to manage the loans. After approval by the relevant groups, a request will be submitted to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi for adoption. In the future, after implementation, the interest rates on loan applications will be specially reduced, with the sole purpose of reviving the market in the hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Separate Meetings of Banking and Money Industries</p>
<p>After the banking and money industries associations received a letter from the Local Association requesting the provision of credit loans for industry and commerce, the money industry association held an executive committee meeting the night before last to discuss the matter. Due to the importance of the matter, it was decided to submit it to the general meeting of member representatives for a public vote. The association will convene the meeting within a few days. The banking industry association is scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>To Be Submitted to the Ministry for Adoption After a Decision</p>
<p>It is heard that after the banking and money industries associations meet, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the banking and money industries associations will hold a joint meeting to study the specific implementation measures. After a solution is found, it will be submitted to the Minister of Finance. During the meeting, the topic of these issues was discussed.</p>
<p>Various Industries Hope for Early Implementation</p>
<p>A Xinsheng She reporter learned from various important industries yesterday morning that after the market revival plan is decided, the Local Association will have the government and the banking and money industries each contribute 5 million yuan for credit loans, according to the plan. After approval by the relevant groups, a request will be submitted to Minister Kong for implementation. Currently, industry and commerce are in severe decline and are difficult to maintain. Therefore, everyone hopes that these credit loans can be implemented as soon as possible to alleviate business difficulties. As for the loan scheme with goods as collateral, it is also hoped that the government and the banking and money industries will adopt and implement it as much as possible, it was said.</p>
<p>Measures Pending Decision by the Syndicate</p>
<p>For the credit loans, the banking and money industries will each contribute 2.5 million yuan, which will be divided equally by the member banks of the banking association and the member money shops of the money industry association, each contributing 1.25 million yuan. Any shop or factory in the Shanghai area that is owned by Chinese capital may apply for a loan, using a joint guarantee method. However, it is still necessary to wait for the establishment of the syndicate before further discussions and decisions are made.</p>

However, they returned to this port on the President Hoover again on the 23rd of this month and will travel to various places in North China before returning to the United States via Japan. According to Mr. Hollingsworth, China purchases more goods from Los Angeles than the entire United Kingdom, so people in Los Angeles are very concerned about China's development.</p>
<h3>Heads of Two Departments from Hunan Province Arrived in Shanghai to Negotiate Public Debt Mortgages</h3>
<p>Visited Zhang Gongquan and Others Yesterday to Negotiate; Cash Mortgages to Complete Three Major Highways</p>
<p>He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, because he received an order from Chairman Chiang to complete the Hunan-Hubei, Hunan-Guizhou, and Hunan-Guangxi three major roads by a deadline, needs a large amount of funds.

<h3>The Opening Date of the Art Exhibition Preview is Not Yet Set</h3>
<p>Exhibits Can Be Put on Display Starting on the 20th</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the London Exhibition of Chinese Art preview has been actively selecting antiques and arranging the venue for the past month. However, because the selection work is time-consuming, the opening date will be at the earliest at the end of the month. The rumor that it will open on the 20th is not accurate. A Central News Agency reporter visited the person in charge of the exhibition yesterday to inquire about the latest situation, and received the following replies:</p>
<p>British Commissioners Have Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>A total of five commissioners specially appointed by the London Exhibition of Chinese Art to come to China to select antiques for exhibition in England have arrived. Among them, Sir David, Raphael Hobson, and Ormofu Polus have arrived in Shanghai and are staying at the Cathay Hotel. The day before yesterday, Yang Zhensheng of the exhibition specially hosted a banquet for the four commissioners at Wen Yuanning's residence, accompanied by Ma Heng, Wen Yuanning, and Zhao Tiezhang, to strengthen their relationships.</p>
<p>Visited Antiques Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the four British commissioners came to the exhibition to view ancient paintings, hosted by Yang Zhensheng, Ma Heng, Gu Shusen, and Wen Yuanning. They praised the ancient art of our country very sincerely but did not express any special opinions. They will leave Shanghai after the preview closes, while David and Raphael will take a detour through Japan and America to select ancient Chinese art owned by American collectors for collection and transport to England for exhibition.</p>
<p>Antiques from Various Places Have Been Delivered</p>
<p>The antiques from various places participating in the preview have generally been delivered. However, ancient woodblock prints and other items collected by the Peking Library and various antiques obtained from archaeological excavations by the Academia Sinica have not yet arrived in Shanghai. The exhibition has already sent a telegram urging them, and they should also be delivered soon.</p>
<p>Review Work Will Be Completed</p>
<p>Regarding the review of antiques, bronzes have been completed, and calligraphy and painting have also been largely completed. In terms of porcelain, Ming porcelain will be reviewed today. Today, the calligraphy and painting on fans will also be inspected on Tianzhutang Street.</p>
<p>External Affairs Department Reassigns Assistant</p>
<p>In addition, Wu Zexiang, specially assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist the exhibition with foreign affairs, has now been transferred to Sichuan by order of the Ministry and replaced by Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Additional Glass Cabinets</p>
<p>The renovation of the venue has been completed. However, 64 glass cabinets for displaying antiques were originally ordered from the Dahua Iron Factory and have all been delivered to the exhibition, but they are still not enough. Thirty more were added and will all be delivered before the 20th. Therefore, starting from the 20th, exhibits can be put on display.</p>
<p>Requesting Half of the Fee to Be Allocated for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Guowen She reports that the Land Disaster Relief Association in the Renji Charity Hall on Yunnan Road in this city has received representatives from various disaster areas who have continued to come and request funds, but the relief funds have already been allocated and there is nothing to do. It happened that the antiques being transported to England were exhibited in Shanghai in advance and a small viewing fee was collected. The association recently requested the antique preview to allocate half of the viewing fee to the association to prepare for disaster relief. It is now learned that the preview exhibition is considering the matter is of great importance and will submit it to the Nanjing Antiquities Preservation Committee for instructions.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Representatives Will Go to the Northwest for Study</h3>
<p>Preparing to Invest in the Development of the Northwest</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that according to Xie Zhongfu, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, after the overseas Chinese representatives who returned to China to attend the Fifth National Congress arrived in Beijing, because the Congress was postponed and the round trip was long, some are still staying in Beijing. The authorities of the Northwest provinces believe that the development of the Northwest is extremely important. Although various circles in the country have recognized this, they are often unable to proceed immediately due to insufficient strength. They deeply hope that overseas Chinese will return to China to invest in the Northwest. They have already reached an agreement with the overseas Chinese representatives staying in Beijing to organize study groups to go to various Northwest provinces to study, so that they can clearly understand the current situation in the Northwest and the importance of development. Then, after they return overseas, they will announce to the overseas Chinese, organize groups, and go to the Northwest to invest. They will depart as soon as the weather warms up. The group also plans to travel to Sichuan and Xikang after the Northwest study is completed.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Again Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department to Stop Telephone Price Increases</h3>
<p>Whether from a Public Welfare or a Commercial Perspective, Public Interests Should Not Be Extorted Again</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, stating, "To the honorable department, on January 30th of this year, this chamber, according to letters from the silk and satin industry, the dyeing and weaving industry, and 26 other industry associations, stated that the Shanghai Telephone Company, at a time when the city's commerce is collapsing, is discussing increasing telephone fees for citizens, which disregards public welfare and only seeks private gain. We request that you negotiate to cancel it, etc. We immediately sent letter No. 1567 of the Pu character, requesting your department to consider the public interest and stop it, which is on record. More than a month has passed, and we have not yet received a reply. Now, we have received another letter from the book industry association, which states, 'Newspapers are reporting that telephone prices in this port are about to increase. Telephones are a means of transportation, and commercial markets have regarded them as necessities, like grains and water, as a type of expense. In recent years, due to the global economic downturn, industries in this port have been in recession and suffering deeply. The telephone company suddenly has an increase in prices, wanting to increase profits alone, which is unreasonable. We request that you forward this to the Public Works Department for practical prevention, etc.' According to the Public Utilities Report column in the sixth issue, ninth volume, of your department's gazette, the company's request to amend the price list is to increase its total revenue by 22.89% and increase the annual interest on its invested capital to about 10%, of which 2% is for the general reserve fund. This chamber believes that if the company requested a price increase based on the previous contract with your department when the market was stable, it would still be reasonable. Now, the market is so depressed, and the number of shops, factories, and industries that are in a state of semi-suspension is unprecedented. According to its own report, the Shanghai Telephone Company was still able to obtain a net profit of 6.13% in 1934, which is a rare profit in commerce. Whether from a public welfare perspective or purely from a commercial perspective, public interests should not be extorted again to increase its income. We correspondently request your department, for the sake of the interests of the majority of citizens, to not approve the case, which is our utmost hope."</p>
<h3>Large Number of US Warships Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, is scheduled to depart from Manila in late this month with Commander-in-Chief Admiral Hepburn and arrive in Shanghai on March 31st. Then, the flagship of the Fifth Destroyer Division, the USS Black Hawk, and the Thirteenth, Thirty-fourth, and Forty-fifth Destroyer Divisions will all take the route through Hong Kong and successively sail to Shanghai. Each division has four warships. The Fifth Submarine Division will also arrive in Shanghai in April. In addition, the Third Mine Division and the aircraft squadron of the Asiatic Fleet will also arrive successively. After staying in Shanghai for more than ten days, they will all go to North China for the summer. There will be a total of 39 warships of various sizes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Forty Groups of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Including Zhou Anren and Others and Nine Japanese Wives</p>
<p>Zhou Anren, Yang Baohe, Chen Jinkui, Zhang Qingqi, Lu Yishun, and Li Hongfa, overseas Chinese residing in Chiba Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture, Japan, and Zhuo Zi (Japanese nationality), the wife of Lin Zhenqing, and son, from the previous twenty-sixth group of expelled refugees, totaling nine people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover. This is the fortieth group of refugees returning to China. According to Zhou Anren, speaking to a Shiye She reporter, these refugees resided in Chiba Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Recently, Japanese police have been arresting and abusing overseas Chinese on a large scale. Because these overseas Chinese were afraid of being arrested, they fled to the Tokyo branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party for temporary hiding for three days. On the eighth, they boarded the ship from Yokohama to Shanghai. These refugees are also carrying a certificate from our country's Consul General in Japan for entry into Qiaole Village, in order to enter the village to cultivate land.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Claims Japanese Goods Imports are Not Strong</h3>
<p>Claims it is Due to the Poor State of Chinese Society</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reports that since the development of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, rumors have spread that imports of Japanese goods have gradually increased. However, although the voice of anti-Japanese sentiment has subsided, the financial pressure and exchange rate fluctuations in China, judging from the state of transactions in various aspects, have not made any progress. Recently, the Shanghai branch of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, regarding the Mikasa Maru, which was imported today (the 13th), said that although there were 2,500 tons of goods, excluding 800 tons of rice and cotton, it was still not a full ship. In addition, the Asama Maru had 1,600 tons of cargo, but it did not reach six-tenths of the full ship. This is enough to prove that the import of Japanese goods has not increased in any way, but has only maintained the status quo. In the past, due to anti-Japanese relations, Japanese goods could not be imported, but now there is no anti-Japanese movement, and the reason why imports are not strong is due to the poor state of society in general.</p>
<h3>Secretary of the Embassy in Turkey, Feng Hongdao, and Others Depart Today</h3>
<p>Ambassador He Will Take Office on the 10th of Next Month</p>
<p>Feng Hongdao, Li Xianglu, and Yao Zhuxiu, secretaries and director of our country's embassy in Turkey, took the night train from Beijing together at 11:00 PM the night before last and arrived here at 7:20 AM yesterday. They are scheduled to take the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso to Turkey at 2:00 PM this afternoon to organize the embassy's houses.

<h3>The National Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Ministry of Finance to Delay the Implementation of the New Regulations on Wine Tax in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating, "We have investigated that our association previously received a letter from the representatives of the chambers of commerce of various counties in Chahar Province, stating that the new regulations on wine tax in Chahar Province are harsh, and the people cannot bear it. We request that you forward this to the council for reduction. Our association has telegraphed the council twice to request this, which is on record. Recently, the representatives of the chambers of commerce of the province, Wang Youzhi, Cui Yunshan, Wei Tai, and Li Kuan, came to the council to state everything and said that they had already petitioned your ministry and the Tax Affairs Administration. In view of this, we have further investigated that the Chahar Province Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau has changed from contract amount to actual collection this time. In principle, the wine merchants in Chahar Province do not oppose it. However, the tax rate is several times higher than that of neighboring Hebei Province, which is difficult to maintain business. Some have been forced to voluntarily close their businesses, and the Chahar Province Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau must forcibly pay half a year of closure fees, otherwise they will be sealed and detained. The harsh situation is unbearable. Chahar Province is adjacent to the border, and strong neighbors are eyeing it. At a time when foreign troubles are deepening, extra care should be given to the situation. If we act rashly, there is a danger of harming fish and inciting birds. It is reasonable to telegraph your ministry again for review and approval. We sincerely request that you quickly order the release of the seals and people, delay the implementation of the new regulations, cancel the closure fees, revise the tax rate according to Hebei, and temporarily collect taxes according to the old regulations until the new regulations are formulated, in order to relieve the people's livelihood and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. Sincerely, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China."</p>

<h3>Western Constable Beats a Vegetable Vendor to Death. A Petition is Filed with the Court Requesting Summons of Witnesses for Investigation. Representatives of the Municipal Federation Branch Call for Investigation of the Facts in Preparation for Negotiations.</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after a Western constable from the Putuo Road Police Station No. 62 beat a vegetable vendor to death, the Fourth District Branch of the Municipal Federation of Citizens held a meeting the previous day and appointed Chen Weiwen, Liang Ruiting, Zhu Qizhen, Wu Shuying, and Wang Xianggu as five representatives to petition the Municipal Federation to assist the victim, Zhao Yongru, in negotiating for punishment of the murderer and compensation, and to retain Wang Xianggu and Wu Shaoshan as lawyers to represent Zhao Yongru and draft a petition requesting the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court to summon witnesses for investigation. The original petition stated: "A Western constable from the Putuo Road Police Station No. 62 chased and beat a female civilian, causing her to fall to the ground and die. We respectfully request that you promptly summon witnesses for investigation so that we can negotiate with the Public Works Bureau for the punishment of the murderer and compensation. Zhao Yongru lives at No. 76 Zhujiawan, Zhabei, and has been making a living by farming. She has a daughter named Liujiali, who is eighteen years old this year. On the morning of the 5th of this month, at around 7 a.m., she and her grandmother, Zhao Zhangshi, carried vegetables to the side of the road in the Lide Oil Factory Lane on Yichang Road in western Shanghai to sell them. Suddenly, a Western constable from the Putuo Road Police Station No. 62 came over and interfered without asking the reason, first hitting her grandmother on the head with a baton. The female civilian, seeing this, immediately fled into the lane. However, the Western constable chased after her relentlessly, caught up, and struck her on the back of the head with his hand, causing her to fall to the ground immediately. Her grandmother rushed forward to help her up, but the Western constable kicked her in the waist and did not allow her to help. At that time, many onlookers gathered around and wanted to come forward to help, but they were all kicked or slapped and driven away, not allowed to rescue her. By the time the police car sent her to the hospital, it was too late to save her, and she died shortly thereafter. In addition to her grandmother, Zhao Zhangshi, and vegetable vendors Hou Zhangshi and Xu Zhangshi, who have testified that the chase and beating were true, there are also eyewitnesses who bought vegetables: Wang Tianjin, Gu Chuanshi, and Ji Xiaomei (addresses listed below), who are all important witnesses and can also be summoned for questioning. Under the broad daylight, the residents of the area all know the situation, and it would not be difficult to send personnel to investigate. In short, the facts of this case are clear and the evidence is conclusive, and the Western constable cannot deny it with empty words. Yongru is over half a century old and has only this one daughter. All the vegetables she grows depend on her and her grandmother going to the streets to sell them to earn a living. Unexpectedly, the Western constable used his foreign power and acted lawlessly, beating her to death, not only cutting off Yongru's only remaining lifeline but also putting Yongru's entire family in a dead end. As long as there is breath, we vow to avenge this grievance. Moreover, the Western constable not only does not bow his head and submit to the law but dares to confuse black and white and collude with witnesses to deny the facts. If this is not thoroughly investigated, the truth will be difficult to reveal. If the Western constable is allowed to go scot-free, then the lives of citizens will be in danger. Although the Western constable is British and our country's courts are subject to consular jurisdiction and cannot accept the case, for the sake of initiating negotiations, it is extremely convenient for your court to investigate the facts and collect evidence. We believe that the great British Empire has always been known for its spirit of the rule of law and will not destroy it because of the Western constable. This matter concerns the dignity of the nation and the lives of the people. Therefore, we specially submit this petition and cry out to your court to examine and approve it, promptly summon witnesses for investigation, so that we can negotiate with the Public Works Bureau for the punishment of the murderer and compensation, in order to maintain the dignity of the nation and avenge this grievance. Furthermore, we previously received notice of the results of the autopsy, and we ask for instructions so that we can study them. Mother Ren Dewei respectfully submits this petition to the Procuratorate of the First Special District Local Court."</p>
<h3>The International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Products</h3>
<p>American Merchants Need Chinese Cinnamon. Swedish Merchants are Willing to Sell Our Textiles.</p>
<p>American Demand for Cinnamon</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau at the New Rubbish Bridge yesterday, cinnamon is produced in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi and Guizhou, accounting for about 65% of the world's production. The cultivation of cinnamon trees is particularly prevalent in the counties south of the West River in Guangxi Province, between Xunzhou and Pingnan Yulin. Every year, it is transported to foreign countries via Guangzhou, mainly to the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, India, and other countries. It is used to make spices and medicines, as it has properties that stimulate, strengthen, replenish, dispel wind, and astringe. Therefore, in medicine, it can treat internal wind, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other symptoms. After cinnamon is distilled into oil, it is also an indispensable raw material for making perfume and scented soap. Recently, the New York Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent a letter stating that an importer in the United States needs Chinese cinnamon. We hope that exporters will send a letter to the guidance department of the bureau for introduction.</p>
<p>Swedish Sale of Textiles</p>
<p>In addition, the Swedish Weisheng Company sent a letter stating that it is willing to manage and sell Chinese printed rayon fabrics and cotton fabrics. Manufacturers who wish to seek sales abroad can send a letter to the bureau to request introduction.</p>

<h3>Foreigners Get Lost While Spring Hunting, Falsely Reported Missing</h3>
<p>Two Cases Involving Americans and Japanese Have Occurred One After Another. The Municipal Public Security Bureau Issued a Notice to All Bureaus to Pay Attention.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has recently noted that during the spring season, foreigners often get lost while spring hunting, resulting in their disappearance. For example, an American recently went hunting in Wusong and took shelter from the wind in Yunzao Creek. It was not until three days later that his whereabouts were known. In addition, Suwa Ichiro, a Japanese employee of the Gungda Yarn Factory, got lost while hunting and was also reported missing. He returned the next day. Therefore, yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau specially ordered the Central, Caojiadu, Pudong, and Zhenru sub-bureaus, offices, and water patrol teams to instruct the chiefs to pay special attention during this period, conduct inspections at any time, and check gun licenses and hunting certificates, and provide mutual supervision along the way to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Emphasizes the Welfare of Ordinary People</h3>
<p>Borrowing 1.5 Million from Shanghai Electric Power Company. 1 Million for Building Housing for Ordinary People, 500,000 for Relieving Rickshaw Pullers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of the rising cost of living in the city and the importance of the well-being of the majority of ordinary people in the current recession, has had Mayor Wu formulate a plan to implement and earnestly proceed. It is expected to be realized soon. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of a Management Committee The Municipal Government will establish a Management Committee for the Welfare of Ordinary People to facilitate the handling of welfare matters. The committee will be established soon. The candidates for the committee members have been determined by Mayor Wu. In addition to the competent authorities, individuals with rich experience in architecture and economics, as well as those enthusiastic about charity, will be invited to serve as committee members. After the establishment of the committee, it will proceed according to the plan.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Loan According to Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, who spoke to a Central News Agency reporter, the funds required for the welfare undertaking have been properly planned, and 1 million will be allocated from the 1.5 million loan established with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to handle the project. The loan has already been delivered to the Municipal Government by the Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>Housing for Ordinary People Although the various plans for the loan have been determined, they have not yet been utilized. Therefore, the Municipal Government will use it after receiving the official approval from the Central Government. The approval is expected to arrive soon. The Municipal Government is eager to implement the project, so construction of housing for ordinary people will begin after the approval arrives.</p>
<p>Relief for Rickshaw Pullers In addition to housing for ordinary people, the Municipal Government also plans to undertake relief projects for rickshaw pullers. All funds required for the project will be allocated from the 1.5 million loan with the Shanghai Electric Power Company, with an allocation of 500,000. However, according to the various projects stipulated in the plan, 500,000 may not be sufficient. Therefore, it is planned that additional funds will be raised as necessary to complete the project.</p>
<h3>Copyright Lawsuit over the New History of Yuan</h3>
<p>The Book and Newspaper Cooperative Society is Accused of Unauthorized Reprinting. Ke Changsi and His Brothers File a Lawsuit.</p>
<p>Ke Shaomin, a Hanlin scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, lived in seclusion in the former capital after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, living as a reclusive old gentleman, using writing to entertain himself. After his death, his remaining works were all held by his sons Ke Changsi, Changji, Changfen, and Yongxi. Among them, the most valuable and worthy of passing down to future generations is the book "New History of Yuan," which consists of 256 volumes. Initially, it was not published. Later, Changsi and others submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior of the National Government to register and obtain the copyright, and then submitted the original manuscript to the Kaiming Bookstore in the city for publication. The advance subscription for the Twenty-Five Histories issued by the bookstore last summer was to combine the original Twenty-Four Histories with the New History of Yuan into one book. However, shortly thereafter, the Book and Newspaper Cooperative Society also advertised the advance subscription for the Twenty-Six Histories, with a price lower than Kaiming's. The publication date was within January of this year. At that time, Kaiming had negotiated with the society, and now the Ke brothers, after learning that the New History of Yuan was also included in the Twenty-Six Histories, and that it was purely a reprint of their late father's original work, which violated Article 33 of the Publication Law, hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a criminal lawsuit against Tan Tian, the person in charge of the Book and Newspaper Cooperative Society, requesting that he be punished according to law. They also stated that they reserved all losses suffered by the defendant due to the infringement of copyright, and would file another lawsuit after determining the exact amount of the losses. Yesterday afternoon, Ye Shengchao, the judge of the First Special District Local Court, summoned the defendant. The defendant also hired a lawyer to file a counterclaim against the plaintiffs. According to lawyer Sun, the plaintiffs are all in Beiping, and the defendant's counterclaim is a means of delaying the lawsuit. The court stated that since the defendant had filed a counterclaim, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to appear in court in person, and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the afternoon of the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Taifeng Company Goes Bankrupt, Victims of Shihua Ming</h3>
<p>Huaming Owes 370,000. Taifeng Company Files a Lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Taifeng Canned Food Company on Nanjing Road declared bankruptcy and liquidation in December of last year due to operating losses. The creditors in the silver and money industry have requested the First Special District Court to declare a preliminary attachment on the company. The bankruptcy of Taifeng was caused by the Shihua Mingxingki Match Factory. The Shihua Mingxingki Match Factory was founded by Tang Yaojian (also known as Tang Jianchang), Cai Jianmin, Luo Lefang, Li Songji, Luo Qizhai, Su Yuming, Chen Depei, Ren Lansun, Wang Chichen, Cai Kemin, Li Haidong, and others. They had a business contract with the Taifeng Company. As of June 30, 1932, they owed Taifeng 200,229 taels and 7 qian and 2 fen, plus monthly interest of 5,152 yuan and 8 jiao and 9 fen. The Huaming Factory mortgaged the factory foundation certificate of 9 mu, 7 fen, 7 li, and 3 hao and eight buildings located at No. 904 East Road of the Jiangwan Sports Association, as well as machinery, assets, and inventory to the Taifeng Company. The contract stipulated that if Taifeng Company deemed the factory's business to be dangerous or the arrears were too large, it could declare Huaming bankrupt and sell the mortgaged property to pay off the debt. In December of last year, Taifeng took control of the factory in accordance with the contract. At the same time, Taifeng also declared bankruptcy. The total amount owed by the Huaming Factory to Taifeng was 378,108 yuan, 4 jiao, and 7 fen. Therefore, the liquidator, lawyer, and accountant of Taifeng Company filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Tang Yaojian and the other eleven people, requesting repayment of the debt. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the First Special District Court opened the civil case and summoned the eleven defendants. Only Tang Yaojian, Cai Jianmin, Luo Qizhai, Su Yuming, and Wang Tiechen hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to appear in court. The others did not appear. Lawyer Zhao stated that he had been commissioned in a hurry and had not yet submitted a written response. The court then announced a postponement for further hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Student Zhu Jianqiu of Southeast Medical College Died Tragically from Injuries. The Court Scheduled a Resumption of the Hearing on the 15th of this Month. Apprentice Gu Fulang Was Also Summoned for Questioning.</h3>
<p>Zhu Jianqiu, the owner of the Jiating Food Company below the Zhenru Radio Station, had served in the military and political circles in the past and was quite knowledgeable. Later, due to circumstances, he resigned from his position and ran a food company in Zhenru, handling everything personally and working hard. Most of the diners who came to the company for a meal were students from various schools, all intellectuals. This time, Zhu Jianqiu was subjected to a barbaric act in the police station for a trivial matter, being forcibly irrigated with a large amount of clear water through his nose, resulting in suffocation and death. Those who knew him all sighed. They felt that this promising young man had died unexpectedly, and they all felt injustice. Therefore, students Hong Xingchi, Zhang Xilin, Zhan Jihan, Hu Weisan, and Yu Zhesheng from Southeast Medical College came to court to testify about Zhu Jianqiu's condition when he was released from the police station, which was very detailed. The hospital's diagnosis also stated Zhu Jianqiu's condition upon admission: he was mentally confused, his breathing was weak and intermittent, his pulse was 120 beats per minute, his body temperature was 36.5 degrees, his face was cyanotic, there was no reaction in the cornea and pupils, the pupils were small, there was a slight flow of blood from the nostrils, and the ciliary reflex of the knee joint was present. After examining his whole body, there were numerous small abrasions and small wounds on his chest and back, a cyanotic purple color on the back of his head. Listening to his heart, the heartbeat was barely audible, without sound. There were numerous blisters in the lungs, which could be heard. Efforts were made to rescue him, but ultimately to no avail. From the time of admission at 3:00 p.m. on December 26th until his death at 5:00 a.m. on the 27th, Zhu was found to have blisters in his lungs by the hospital. By the time of the autopsy, the truth was revealed. Shao Qinzhi, the presiding judge of the local court, was extremely cautious about this case. During the hearing the other day, he questioned the police station chief and members separately, who shirked responsibility from each other. As a result, police officer Xing Guonong was detained, and police station chief Zhou Pinghuan and others were released on bail with a security deposit. The magistrate said that Gu Fulang, an apprentice at the food company, had been detained overnight at the police station on the afternoon of December 25th. When questioned about Zhou Pingyuan, he said that he had stayed in the internal affairs room, etc. Therefore, it was necessary to question Yan Fuying about the case. It is now reported that the court is scheduled to resume the hearing on the 15th of this month. Yesterday, summons were issued separately to the complainant, Zhu Shiying, the younger brother of the deceased, and related parties, as well as the defendants, to await trial in court at that time. The lawyers for the defendants were notified to appear in court to defend them.</p>
<h3>Gynecologists Cai Songchun and Others are Accused</h3>
<p>A Pregnant Woman Miscarries After Taking Medicine. They are Prosecuted for Negligent Injury.</p>
<p>Cai Songchun and Cai Bochun, grandsons of Cai Xiaoxiang, a famous gynecologist in Jiangwan, inherited their grandfather's mantle and practiced medicine at No. 5, Lane 1, Jishanli, East and West Huade Roads. Business was not bad. Recently, Ms. Chen Jiang, a native of Ningbo, the wife of Chen Yuying (an employee of the Ning-Shao Life Insurance Company) residing at No. 173 Gongping Road, hired lawyer Shen Zengkuan to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Cai and others of negligent injury. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiang Yinghua presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants also hired lawyers Lu Qi and Chen Guocai to defend them. The plaintiff, Chen Jiang, stated that she was 32 years old, a native of Ningbo. She had given birth six times since marrying Chen Ziying. Her health had been good since her last birth in June of last year. In October, her menstrual cycle came. Recently, she suddenly felt unwell, and her menstruation had not come for three months. She was suspicious and feared that she was pregnant again. Unable to decide for herself, she went to the defendants' clinic for treatment on February 10 of this year. She explained her situation and asked whether she was unwell or pregnant. After taking her pulse, the defendants concluded that she had a menstrual disorder and was not pregnant. Treatment should be given quickly. They prescribed a prescription, and she purchased the medicine and decocted it. After four treatments, around February 20, she suddenly saw blood. But her discomfort worsened. She went back for treatment and took the medicine. On the 23rd, she had unbearable abdominal pain. After 7 p.m., she suddenly miscarried. Only then did she realize that the defendants had made a wrong diagnosis and had been negligent in their duties. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit and submitted the prescription. Her husband, Chen Ziying, also submitted a statement. When questioned, the defendants stated that when the plaintiff came to see them on February 10, they determined that she was pregnant after taking her pulse. Therefore, the medicines prescribed were all products that nourish the blood and regulate qi. Although the word "pregnancy" was not written on the prescription, this was because there were various inconveniences for gynecologists, so it was not stated explicitly. After several treatments, the plaintiff had recovered by the 14th. On the 22nd, the plaintiff came again, saying that she had accidentally lifted heavy objects, causing her to see blood again. This was due to her own carelessness, and they carefully diagnosed and treated her and tried to calm the fetus. Therefore, it would not have led to an abortion by taking the medicine they had prescribed. The defendants' lawyers argued that the prescription should be sent to the National Medical Association for identification. The judge announced that the case would be heard again in seven days.</p>
<h3>Dropped Beef Buns, Stabbed to Death, Trial Opens</h3>
<p>Requesting Change of Prosecution Starts Tomorrow</p>
<p>Jiang Kun, the owner of the Nanyang Paper Box Factory at No. 12 Yuli, Baizi Bridge, French Concession, 39 years old this year, at around 7:00 p.m. on the tenth, ordered his apprentice Li (86 years old, native of Binjiang) to buy four beef buns from Bai Yushan (47 years old, native of Baoding), the owner of Yumeiju, a steamed bun shop located at No. 59 and 61 Pishao Nairo Road, and bring them back to eat. He felt that the meat filling was not cooked. He ordered Li to take them back for exchange. Li accidentally dropped one on the ground. The shop's employees refused to exchange it, which led to an argument. After others intervened, the owner of Yumeiju was still unwilling and led his son and employees with knives to the Nanyang Paper Box Factory to make trouble, stabbing the owner of the factory, Yang Kunsheng, in a vital area, resulting in death without timely treatment. This has been reported in the newspapers. After the incident, the French Concession police first detained Bai Yushan, the owner of Yumeiju, on the case, through detective Zhou Buguang and detective Bao Songlin. The next morning, they reported to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and the people went to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to examine the body and issued an order to the family of the deceased, Yang Xushi, to collect the body and await investigation. The investigating detectives continued to arrest the accomplices, Jia Jinshou, Wang Sandanzi, and the apprentice of the shop. In the afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian conducted the trial. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, described the case, stating that the police had not yet investigated the murder case of the defendant Shi Yushan and requested a postponement for investigation before requesting a trial. The wife of the deceased, Yang Xushi, pleaded for justice, stating that her husband had been tragically stabbed to death and requested justice. When questioned, Shi Yushan confessed that the dispute over the buns started the argument. He was not in the shop. According to the employees, they slammed the pork on the table in the shop. So he went back to the shop to find Yang Kunsheng to reason with him. Yang was not there. A moment later, he returned. He was cutting beef. When someone came back, he went to argue with Yang. He did not put down the sharp knife at the time. When he arrived at Yang's house, many people beat him. He defended himself in confusion, but stabbed Yang fatally. He pleaded for leniency. After reviewing the confession, the court announced that the hearing would be held again on the 25th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Summer Jinrong Accused of Seducing a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Mother of the Girl Firmly Requests Severe Punishment, the Defendant Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Cao Qiaoyun, the only daughter of Cao Ding, a Suzhou woman residing at 922 Avenue Édouard VII in the French Concession, is sixteen years old this year. She studies at Yangxing Elementary School, located opposite the old site of the Xiaowu Stage on Guangxi Road. She is beautiful and her mother loves her dearly. On the evening of January 23rd of this year, Xia Jinrong (twenty-seven years old this year), the son of the late Hubei native Xia Kunshan, a shareholder of the Yuquan Pool bathhouse in Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street, invited Ms. Ding and her daughter to watch a performance at the Tianchan Stage. When the audience was densely packed at the end of the show, Xia intentionally created an opportunity for Qiaoyun to become separated from her mother. He then lured the girl to the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, where he forcefully defiled her in room 504. Initially, the girl concealed the truth from her mother. It was not until the Lantern Festival that Ms. Ding discovered that her daughter had been violated by Xia. When she confronted Xia, she was met with harsh words and abuse. Unable to endure this, Ms. Ding, as the legal guardian, together with her daughter, filed a lawsuit with lawyer to the criminal division of the Special No. 2 District Court, accusing Xia Jinrong of raping a girl under fifteen years of age, a crime against public morals, and of abducting a minor girl, depriving a person of parental rights, and committing lewd acts, a crime against family. She requested that the law be applied to the case. As reported earlier, the court, based on the lawsuit, summoned the defendant through Judge Li Changnian and clerk Wang Baoxun of the Criminal Division 2 the other day. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, mother and daughter, along with their lawyer, appeared in court. The official briefly questioned Ms. Ding and her daughter about their age and address. Then, he announced that the defendant had not appeared, and the trial could not proceed and would be rescheduled. Ms. Ding stated that the defendant was deliberately avoiding appearing in court and that someone had seen him playing mahjong yesterday and that he had not left Shanghai. She said that he had repeatedly asked people to mediate, but she refused and insisted that the judge administer justice to him; otherwise, people would not be able to raise daughters in the future. Furthermore, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the defendant's handwritten list of names from when he registered the hotel room as evidence, claiming that the defendant was refusing to appear in court and requesting that he be arrested and brought to trial. After examining the presented list of names, the judge ordered that a new hearing date be set and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Venus: A Dancer Dies Tragically from an Abortion</h3>
<p>Dancing While Heavily Pregnant, an Abortion Leads to Death</p>
<p>Bao Huiying, a dancer from Xuzhou at the Weiner Qi (also known as La Dahua) dance hall on North Sichuan Road, is twenty-three years old. She lives with her father, Bao Zhenyuan, at 13 Sanxing Lane, North Sichuan Road. Bao has no formal husband. Recently, she suddenly became pregnant. By the end of last month, she was three months pregnant. Bao's profession involves being embraced by patrons. Once pregnant, her abdomen would swell, inevitably hindering her business. Moreover, as an unmarried woman, being pregnant would significantly damage her reputation. Therefore, she consulted with acquaintances about a suitable solution. The result was that abortion was the only option. On the 4th of this month, she went to Liu Wang, a seventy-three-year-old midwife at 723 Jiujiang Road, requesting an abortion. The agreed-upon price was twenty-four yuan. Ms. Liu applied a plaster to Bao's navel and gave her some pills to take. However, after a night, there was no effect. The next day, she went again, and Ms. Liu changed the plaster, applying it to her navel, and performed a procedure, massaging Bao's abdomen for a while before instructing her to return home. That evening, a piece of flesh in Bao's abdomen did indeed come out, which seemed promising. However, a day or two later, Bao had a slight diarrhea. She inquired with Ms. Liu, who told her that she only needed to consume a little hot porridge to recover. Bao followed her instructions, and initially, it seemed to work. But then the diarrhea worsened, becoming more severe day by day. By the day before yesterday, her condition was extremely dangerous. Consequently, Bao Zhenyuan sent his daughter to Guangren Hospital at 4 p.m. for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 6 p.m. The hospital notified the Zhabei Police Station by telephone, ordering detectives Yao Jiaqi and Qiu Sijiu to go and transport Bao's body to the forensic examination office on Fei Lun Road. They investigated the situation and arrested Liu Wang. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Criminal Division 1 court of the Special District No. 1. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation and charged Liu Wang under Article 306 of the Criminal Code, stating that the case required a forensic examination this morning. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned. Liu Wang confessed to performing the abortion on the deceased but claimed that the cause of death was due to the deceased's own negligence in diet. Criminal Division Chief Qian Hongye reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. Liu Wang was granted bail of five hundred yuan due to her old age, but if no bail was provided, she would be detained. At 10 a.m., Prosecutor Tang from the Special District No. 1 Prosecutor's Office arrived to examine the body. Bao Zhenyuan stated that he did not know beforehand that his daughter was going to get an abortion. Detective Qiu then submitted a report detailing the investigation into Bao's affair with someone. Mr. Tang then ordered that since Bao Huiying died from illness after an abortion, Liu Wang, who intended to profit by causing an abortion, had already been prosecuted by the police. The body was handed over to Bao Zhenyuan for burial.</p>
<h3>Fire Department Builds Giant Fire Engine</h3>
<p>—Scheduled to be Commissioned Early Next Month—</p>
<p>Mayor Wu to Be Invited to Officiate at the Commissioning Ceremony, Assigned to Caojiadu for Factory Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Department Fire Department, in order to expand the city's fire-fighting equipment, has built two of the largest giant pump fire engines, pioneering the self-manufacture of fire pump vehicles in our country. According to the Municipal Police Department Fire Protection Division, one of the vehicles has been completed and tested successfully. The other vehicle is expected to be completed by the end of this month. Mayor Wu is scheduled to preside over the commissioning ceremony in early June. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>One Vehicle Completed</p>
<p>According to Dong Zhihe, Director of the Municipal Police Department Fire Protection Division, the giant pump truck built by the Fire Department is the largest of all fire engines in our country. Previously, fire trucks in our country were ordered from abroad, each costing more than 20,000 yuan. In order to recover the outflow of profits, two vehicles were self-made, with a total cost of only over 10,000 yuan. One of them, which began manufacturing last winter, has been fully completed after more than three months. The results of the trial yesterday were excellent. Senior officials from the fire brigades in both concessions also visited and expressed satisfaction.</p>
<p>General Equipment</p>
<p>The completed giant fire truck uses imported "Da Meng Tian" brand parts for the engine, while the rest of the equipment uses domestic materials. It has a power of 70 horsepower and a water output of 500 gallons per minute. The vehicle under construction uses a "Carter Lilik" engine with a power of 70 horsepower. It is equipped with a 50-foot high new-style automatic ladder and a hard-pressure pump, with a water output of 350 gallons per minute. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Commissioning Ceremony</p>
<p>It is currently waiting for the completion of the second fire truck. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade has requested the Municipal Police Department to forward a request to Mayor Wu to attend the grand commissioning ceremony at the beginning of next month. The fire truck will be assigned to that area for application. Due to the concentration of factories and the mixture of Chinese and foreign residents in the Caojiadu area, it is necessary to increase fire-fighting capabilities.</p>

<h3>Successful Experiment in Extracting Casein from Soybean Cake</h3>
<p>Invented by Wang Shuheng</p>
<p>Wang Shuheng, a senior in the Chemistry Department of Shanghai University, recognizing that casein is an important raw material for various industries and has been increasingly used in recent years, with annual consumption in various countries being astonishing, noted that the source of casein is extraction from milk, with very low yields. Someone invented extraction from soybeans, with yields far exceeding milk. Now, Mr. Wang has further extracted it from soybean cake, with yields doubling those from soybeans. After a long period of research and experimentation, he has finally succeeded, making a major contribution to the industrial world of our country. Mr. Wang's description is recorded below.</p>
<p>Casein is a protein, with the English name Casein. Milk contains an average of 2.5-3.5%. To this day, all countries in the world rely on this for the extraction of casein. In the past 30 years, the use of casein in industry has become increasingly widespread, and the importance of its manufacturing industry has also increased. Therefore, countries with insufficient milk production must import casein from abroad. For example, Germany imports large quantities of casein from the United States and France, with annual consumption of approximately 15,000,000 pounds. The United States produced only 8,000,000 pounds in 1918, increasing to 18,000,000 pounds in 1927, and importing as much as 28,000,000 pounds from abroad after 1928. The consumption of casein is increasing daily, while the content in milk is so small. Therefore, there is a need to find new sources of supply. Our country's famous major product, soybean, is an ideal item for supplying this new source. Someone has tested extraction, with a maximum yield of 17%, which is six times that of milk. However, the author (Mr. Wang referring to himself) considers that once soybeans are extracted, they can only be used as fertilizer and cannot be pressed for oil again. If it can be extracted from soybean cake, the cost can be reduced several times, so I immediately began research. After a long period of experimentation, the results show that soybean cake not only contains casein, but the content is very high. Each pound of soybean cake can yield more than 160 grams, in other words, the yield accounts for about 36%.</p>
<p>[Manufacturing of Casein in Industry] There are many methods for manufacturing casein in milk, but the large-scale manufacturing methods are no more than the following three: (1) precipitation with acids, (2) coagulation with coagulating enzymes (Rennet), and (3) self-acidifying coagulation. In addition, there is also electrolysis, but this method is extremely difficult in the selection of electrodes and is still in the research stage in the laboratory. It has not yet been applied in industry. The author has conducted multiple experiments on all three methods, and after changing the first method, the results are very good.</p>
<p>[Comparison of Animal Casein and Plant Casein] Casein is a tasteless and odorless white solid. The percentage of its constituent elements is as follows: Casein is a phosphorus-containing protein with a molecular weight of around 1135. It is a weakly acidic salt and forms acid with neutralizing agents. In dilute salt solutions and under Polarized Light, it has a left-handed rotation, is slightly soluble in water, and extremely soluble in caustic soda and concentrated acids, insoluble in alcohol and ethers. If dissolved in strong hydrochloric acid, it produces a beautiful purple color. The above is the commonality of animal casein in milk. The author has performed quantitative analysis of plant casein extracted from soybean cake and compared it with commercially available animal casein (i.e., that extracted from milk), and they are generally similar. Their solubility and chemical effects are also similar.</p>
<p>[Application of Casein in Industry] (1) Various adhesives (Glurd), especially 包·鑲·塗·蓋·Glues (Venneer Glue), (2) artificial hard inlays (Compact), such as Bakelite, Golallth, and artificial horn, (3) photographic film, (4) cosmetics, (5) soap, (6) paper, (7) rayon, (8) artificial leather, (9) wallpaper, (10) paint, (11) pharmaceuticals, (12) food, (13) electrical insulators, (14) shoe polish, (15) massage cream, (16) mineral oil coagulants, (17) waterproof cloth, (18) insecticide powder, (19) dyeing industry, (20) refining alcohol. From this, it can be seen that casein is truly one of the promising new industries in our country. Given the important position of soybeans in our country today, this industry truly needs to be developed.</p>

<h3>The Plight of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's inland river routes consist of fifteen lines, nineteen small steamers, sixteen company ships, and four cargo ships, operating in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In 1930, the National China Merchants Bureau leased them to the Zhejiang Construction Department. In June 1931, they were subleased to businessman Zhang Jingpei, under the name of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau Management Office, for a term of four years, with an annual rent of 30,800 yuan. The affiliated routes were contracted out to local shipping merchants one after another, with annual rental income of approximately 80,000 yuan. The payment of rent to the Zhejiang Construction Department and the expenses for repairing ships, as well as room rent, salaries, and all miscellaneous expenses, totaled more than 78,000 yuan. From July 1931 to the estimated budget for 1933, income and expenses could still be offset. However, during the Shanghai war, as many as thirteen small steamers were requisitioned for military use. After the ceasefire, when the ships were recovered, they were all severely damaged, with repair costs and compensation for food and labor losses exceeding 20,000 yuan. Recently, with the gradual completion of highways in various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the competition from declining automobile prices, the inland river shipping industry has plummeted. Although lines such as Xili, Suqin, and Suhang are bound by contracts, the rent has been reduced again and again, to less than half of the original contracted price. The Xicheng line has even disappeared in effect. Therefore, the total income has been reduced to more than 47,000 yuan. In 1934, due to drought and water depletion, navigation was suspended for three months. Although various expenses were extremely frugally managed, the losses were still significant. The lessee reluctantly maintained due to contractual constraints. However, the contractors of each route have long requested to terminate the contracts and return the leases one after another. When the contract expires in the future, the rental income is feared to be less than 40,000 yuan, and the age of the ships is increasing, requiring even greater repairs. After the lease term expires, it may be difficult to continue.</p>

<h3>Tung Yih Bank Shareholders' Meeting Resolves to Maintain the Status Quo, Collect Debts and Return Deposits to Depositors</h3>
<p>Tung Yih Bank on Avenue Edward VII, due to financial difficulties before the closing of accounts, announced a temporary suspension of business. The collection of debts and the entrustment of accountant Xu Yongqian to liquidate the assets has been going on for two months. A temporary shareholders' meeting was convened a month ago, but the number of attendees and the number of shares were too small, resulting in adjournment. Yesterday, a second temporary shareholders' meeting was reconvened at Mr. Xu's accounting firm. Only thirteen people attended, representing more than 10,000 shares. However, in accordance with company law, a resolution could be made on handling the aftermath. The meeting resolved to temporarily maintain the status quo, actively collect debts, and return deposits to depositors. As for the bank's general manager, Mr. Zhang Danru, he has already left Shanghai. Mr. Yu Huan Cheng has been entrusted with responsibility for unresolved matters.</p>

Resolution: Approved, and Mao Yingbo will be assigned to draft a document requesting that all legal organizations in the city unite to assist in the implementation.</p>
<p>5.  Adjournment.</p>
<h3>Kang Yuan Canning Factory Implements Group Wedding System</h3>
<p>In recent years, extravagant customs have prevailed, and the marriages of men and women often follow superficial trends. Occasionally, those who care about the world advocate frugality or practice it themselves. Although it is temporarily praised, few respond, and the effect is minimal. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government has stipulated the Shanghai New Life Group Wedding Method, eliminating all the cumbersome formalities of the secular world. The solemnity and seriousness of the ceremony are very suitable for holding a wedding. Xiang Kangyuan, the general manager of the Kang Yuan Canning Factory in this city, has always taken it as his mission to promote frugality and enhance social welfare. He extremely agrees with the group wedding method. On the ninth of this month, he convened a general meeting of all employees to explain the benefits and necessity of frugality. The listeners were moved. He also proposed a method for employees of the factory to participate in group weddings, divided into two types: those held in the municipal government and those held in the factory. All those who live in the city or plan to live in Shanghai with their families after marriage must apply to participate and should strive for frugality and not host banquets. Those who wish to go to the municipal government will be given twenty yuan for participation fees by the factory. For those who wish to hold weddings at the factory, the factory will reserve a date every two months, decorate the auditorium, prepare marriage certificates, provide refreshments, and invite the associate manager to be the wedding officiant. All expenses will be borne by the factory. If anyone is wealthy or constrained by circumstances and cannot comply, they must first donate three months' salary. Those who deliberately disobey and are unwilling to comply will have four months' salary deducted, all of which will be allocated to charitable expenses. The proposal was voted on at the general meeting and unanimously approved. Rules were immediately drafted, announced, and implemented. It is also heard that in order to promote frugality, if any colleagues have weddings or funerals, they should not send out wedding invitations or obituaries within the factory. They can report to the personnel department, which will announce on their behalf. Colleagues who give gifts are limited to one yuan from superiors to subordinates, four jiao from subordinates to superiors, and six jiao for peers. Only reduction is allowed, not exceeding the limit. The company's promotion of frugality and reduction of the pain of living is truly enough to criticize the prevailing customs and cultivate virtues, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Hubei Fellow Villagers Association Elected President and Vice President Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Hubei Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association convened a general meeting of members at the Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM the day before yesterday to elect the first board of directors and supervisors.

All the directors and supervisors then gathered in the assembly hall of the association to take an oath of office, with Mao Xiaxuan, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, and Li Xingchen, a representative from the Social Bureau, serving as the oath administrators. They also voted to elect Wang Shaochuan, Guan Jiongzhi, Liu Wanqing, Yin Guanzhi, Lu Xingjie, Yu Yanqing, Du Xiangqing, Han Juemin, Wu Xingya, Peng Yunqin, and Li Xingchen as the 11 standing directors. Wu Xingya was then publicly elected as honorary president, Guan Jiongzhi as president, and Wang Shaochuan and Liu Wanqing as vice presidents. Immediately afterward, discussions and resolutions began. Six groups were divided: General Affairs, Accounting, Documentation, Publicity, Investigation, etc., and positions were assigned. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Fire at Xibaoxing Road</h3>
<p>At around 9 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the back building of a certain family's house at No. 7, Xier Street, Hengyu Lane, at the intersection of Qingyun Road and Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei. Due to the dry weather, the fire quickly spread, expanding the situation and affecting the facade of No. 6 next door. For a time, flames were raging and unapproachable, and the residents in the lane were even more disturbed, helping the old and leading the young, scrambling to escape. Fortunately, the location was close to the Fourth Fire Brigade, so fire trucks quickly gathered. After the firefighters bravely fought the fire, it was prevented from spreading. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. As a result, No. 7 was completely destroyed, and one room of No. 6's facade was burned. Afterward, the landlord of the building was summoned for questioning, and the cause of the fire was investigated.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (6th continuation)</h3>
<p>— Mu Ouchu</p>
<p>The five fundamental principles are:</p>
<p>(1) Negatively, the real intention of economic control by the strong over the weak should not be disguised under the beautiful name of "economic cooperation" or adjustment. At the same time, positively, the principle of equal and mutually beneficial reciprocity should be adopted.</p>
<p>(2) Negatively, the name of economic adjustment should not be used as a means of political movements against China or against countries other than China; at the same time, positively, economic mutual benefit and the mutual assistance of management and production technologies should be grasped.</p>
<p>(3) Negatively, it should not include any form of current loans and credit settings, and the above-mentioned loan of the difference between import and export prices; at the same time, positively, in the new agreements or joint economic or financial organizations arising from Sino-Japanese economic adjustment, both China and Japan should be able to enjoy complete equity, equal opportunity.</p>
<p>(4) Negatively, the so-called eradication of "anti-Japanese" or "anti-Japanese goods" (which is actually a national goods movement) should not be linked to Sino-Japanese economic adjustment; at the same time, positively, the Japanese side should respect the Chinese side's national goods promotion movement.</p>
<p>(5) Negatively, it should not be publicized that the current economic depression in China is due to the rejection of Japanese goods, and it should be recognized that Sino-Japanese economic adjustment is only a way for both China and Japan to relieve their respective national difficulties.</p>
<p>These two premises and five principles, although not the entirety of the conditions for Sino-Japanese economic adjustment, can be said to be the minimum requirements. If the Japanese side can follow them, then the future of Sino-Japanese economic adjustment is bright. However, when we hear about the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy that Japan is advocating, we can't help but feel worried. In other words, if a Sino-Japanese "Manchuria" group economy is implemented under the leadership of Japan, it is necessary to pay careful attention. Moreover, this group economy is to make China and the puppet organizations equally subject to Japanese control, and we can see this kind of ambition in many Japanese speeches. Moreover, in the current complex international situation, Japan is urgently needed to form a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economy in order to open up its way of survival and to prepare for the Second World War. If we do not understand this point and echo the empty words of Sino-Japanese economic adjustment, it is tantamount to voluntarily joining Japan's Sino-Japanese "Manchuria" group economy and being arbitrarily controlled by Japan. We are not opposed to Sino-Japanese economic adjustment. If Sino-Japanese economic adjustment is indeed beneficial to China's national economy and people's livelihood, we will support it without hesitation. Otherwise, we dare not support it. We believe that the issue of Sino-Japanese economic adjustment is an extremely serious political issue that cannot be ignored, and it is a major issue related to China's survival. Therefore, we sincerely call on people across the country to earnestly study and pay attention to this issue!</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>According to the statement made by the person involved, Zhang Damin, the fact that Tang Jili committed adultery with Ruan Lingyu and slightly abducted a young girl is evident. I, in order to prevent the country's laws from being weakened and to make those who rely on wealth to abuse women know how to be punished, have filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law for thorough investigation. Reports stated that I had a request for one million yuan, and that Ruan Lingyu offered six thousand yuan, and that I, Zhu Neng, agreed, resulting in a failure to reconcile, which is absolutely not the case. I would like to ask your esteemed lawyer to send a letter to correct the above situation. I hereby make a statement on behalf of my client, hoping to publish it in the letter column to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Gaorong, March 12th.</p>

<h3>Li Jinxi Replies to Shu Xincheng Regarding Casting Phonetic Chinese Character Copper Molds</h3>
<p>Discussion on the number of characters in the phonetic copper mold</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education is actively promoting mass education and compulsory education. A month ago, it sent a letter inviting Li Jinxi and Wang Yi, standing committee members of the National Language Unification Preparation Committee, to Beijing to discuss phonetic Chinese character copper molds and simplified characters. After Li and Wang investigated the situation of manufacturing phonetic Chinese character copper molds in Shanghai and submitted a written opinion to the ministry for review, the ministry approved it and handed it over to the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company for casting. Minister Wang Shijie submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and approved the allocation of 20,000 yuan from the first reserve fund under the educational and cultural expenditure for this year to entrust Zhonghua with the casting. After that, all mass readings and primary school textbooks will be printed with phonetic Chinese characters. The plan was also resolved at the National Language Unification Conference on the 3rd of this month and submitted to the ministry for circulation. Shu Xincheng, director of the editing department of Zhonghua Book Company, sent a letter to discuss the limitation of the number of characters in the copper mold. Li Jinxi replied, deciding to cast 5,000 characters first and explaining the concerns of the general public. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Xincheng, I have received both of your letters. The issue of selecting the number of phonetic Chinese characters for the copper mold is indeed as you intended. There is no need to cast 10,000 or 8,000 characters in one go. I was about to reply when Director Zhang Xingfang sent a letter asking for my opinion on your intention. I replied immediately, as follows: "It is best to cast about four or five thousand characters first for the printing of primary school and mass education books and newspapers as the first batch (it is best to cast No. 3 size characters). The font material should be selected by Mr. Shu, sent to the ministry for review and decision. In this way, we can avoid prolonged delays. I agree very much. (However, the remaining characters should also be cast in the future, because even I couldn't read the correct pronunciation of many characters in the Three Capitals and Two Capitals in those years)." Today, I saw in the newspaper that at the 202nd meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 5th, Minister Wang proposed to entrust the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company to cast Chinese phonetic copper molds and drafted a contract, requesting approval to allocate 10,000 yuan from the first reserve fund under the educational and cultural expenditure for this year for working capital. The proposal was approved. This matter has now been finalized, so the number of characters should be decided urgently. According to your instructions, please select five thousand and five thousand to cast. Then this copper mold is enough for any purpose, or it must not be less than five thousand for any purpose. Although primary schools use only three thousand characters, and middle schools only four thousand, they not only read textbooks but also read books and reference books. I think that limiting the use of characters and defining "basic national language" are one thing, and casting phonetic font molds is another. The former is for writing, and the latter is for reading. How can reading be restricted? Children have talent, and the masses have outstanding talents. If they still want to freely read the Three Capitals and Two Capitals, what reason is there to restrict them? I think that one day the four major series published by your company will be rearranged using phonetic Chinese characters. This seems like a joke, but one day it will be done. Because the Three Capitals and Two Capitals have never had phonetic notations, and we have not been able to read them correctly. (In the past, teachers did not know how many character sounds they taught incorrectly. Now, it is not surprising that a large number of middle school and even university students read white characters. This must be verified in practice. Not to mention rare characters, even common characters are full of jokes. If you use the unified national pronunciation, the difference will be even greater.) If all are noted in the past, even children and the masses can at least read them correctly. (Not understanding the meaning is another matter, and being able to follow the phonetic apricot dictionary will completely solve the unsolvable problem of Chinese character retrieval and greatly open the way to white revision and broadcast the opportunity for culture.) As for writing, the number of characters must be limited. However, what is limited is Chinese characters, not phonetics. (Mr. Zhao Yuanren's work on basic national language is related to the principles of national language Romanization. The aims are not entirely the same. The resolution of the national language is also like this. Children and the masses do not need a thousand basic Chinese characters to write. The 3,420 characters of the Pingjiao Association are counted together with reading. If you only talk about writing, a thousand characters is enough. These thousand characters must be written in Chinese characters. Outside of a thousand characters, you can directly write in phonetics. If there are no thousand Chinese characters, you cannot adapt to the current living environment. Children and the masses can gradually write Chinese characters outside of a thousand characters from the publications they read, which is their intelligence. If there is no such intelligence, you can directly write in phonetics outside of a thousand characters. What is the harm of "single use and annotation of words in the mouth"? Mr. Show already cited the example of Confucius' kindergarten students in his second instruction. It is not necessary to limit it to kindergarten students. What is the harm if primary school students do this? What is the harm if the masses do this? Therefore, the number of phonetic Chinese character copper molds must be as large as possible, and limiting the number of basic characters is another matter, not to be discussed together. Therefore, five thousand characters are the first batch, and the second batch should be cast as previously discussed, casting all 9,920 characters in the Commonly Used Vocabulary of National Sounds. The third batch is for the Three Capitals and Two Capitals and is designed for reprinting the four major series. When you are ready to cast the second batch, I will go south again and ask the ministry for funding. At this time, please rush to make the first batch of 5,000 characters to benefit the masses, enlighten children, and benefit scholars. The issues shown in the second letter are even more serious. You think that "students above the third grade of elementary school do not need to use phonetic Chinese characters except for new characters." Using the simple score and the original score of music songs as an analogy, I am afraid that if the simple score is attached, it will not be easy to change to the original score in the future. I will also say nonsense that "the metaphor is not successful." Phonetic symbols can be compared to a simple score, but it is not possible to compare Chinese characters to the original score. Chinese characters are the old gongche score. Annotating Chinese characters with phonetics is annotating gongche with a simple score, not annotating the original score with a simple score. Those who learn Kunqu opera and pihuang opera actually use gongche scores. We should recognize this fact. For the sake of convenience and correctness in learning, we attach a more scientific simple score. This is progress and is gradually becoming a fact. After practicing Kunqu opera and pihuang opera well according to this simple score, you can blow, pull, sing, and perform. The purpose has been achieved. Then why bother about gongche scores? "The trap is used to catch fish. Once you get the fish, forget the trap." Writing is a tool to introduce knowledge and skills, develop thoughts and emotions, and even convey national culture. The tool must be rationalized so that it is easy to get the fish. The purpose is only to get the fish. Today, most Chinese people think that "I would rather not get the fish than forget the trap," or think that the sign is the fish. The Ding County experiment report said that they mistakenly regarded Chinese characters as the knowledge and culture itself, and did not know that it was just a tool (see page 418 of the Outline of National Language History). The Chinese character problem looks serious, but it is actually very easy. You only need to compare it to the gongche score, relax, and annotate it with a simple score. The concerns you have can be dispelled. Therefore, I respectfully follow your advice and expand it slightly. (1) All mass readings are printed in phonetic Chinese characters (as you advise). (2) Part of the readings for kindergarten students and first-grade elementary school students are completely in phonetic symbols (as you advise, please ask your bureau to compile them as soon as possible. For the compilation method, please refer to pages 434,445,152 of the preface to my book Outline of the History of the National Language Movement, which are my simple opinions. I also have detailed designs for kindergarten students to practice phonetic symbols and for first-grade elementary school students to write. Please refer to pages 176,191 of my new book National Language Teaching Method). (3) All textbooks for each subject in the six years of elementary school are printed in phonetic Chinese characters. (4) All extracurricular reading materials for children are printed in phonetic Chinese characters. The above points have been passed as a proposal at the Standing Committee of the National Language Association on the 3rd of this month and submitted to the ministry for review and implementation. Another case is a regulation on the method of specifying the phonetic style, which is attached in two mimeographed copies. You have shown the layer of field trials shown at the end. Over the past ten years, the National Language Association has accumulated reports in various aspects, so it dares to affirm and asks it to be enacted as an order. If you want to do a thorough experiment again, the only prerequisite is to have beautifully printed books and newspapers with phonetic Chinese characters. Otherwise, there is no way to start. However, making more copper molds and widely printing readings with phonetic Chinese characters is still an urgent task in education, not a strong edict of the law. I hope you will plan for it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Edits Municipal Literacy Textbooks</h3>
<p>Divided into four-month and two-month versions. Principles for two-month textbooks are determined.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has organized an editing committee for mass school textbooks and appointed Jiang Shuxun, Chen Bai, Zhang Zhu, Mei Changjia, Shi Lianhuang, Shi Chongpeng, Li Wanyu, Wu Shiqian, Xie Meisun, Ji Xiaobo, Hu Changcai, Su Baogen, and Chen Songchun as members. The mass school textbooks compiled are divided into two types: a four-month version for mass schools and a two-month version for literacy classes. For the two-month version, the following principles were determined at the first editing meeting: (1) Naming: The textbook is named "Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Literacy Textbook." (2) Number of lessons: Six lessons per week, eight reviews, and the remaining time for general review. (3) Word range: The vocabulary compiled by the Mass Education Section is mimeographed into fifteen copies and distributed. Each member subjectively determines 600 words, and then selects the 600 words that appear the most frequently among those determined by the fifteen members as the word range of this textbook. (4) Lesson content: Temporarily divided into four items: civics, nature, society, and hygiene. Civics has sixteen lessons, nature has twelve lessons, society has twelve lessons, and hygiene has eight lessons. Member Li Wanyu will propose topics and submit them for discussion at the next meeting. (5) Lesson style: Mainly in vernacular, rhyming, and simple text. (6) Pictures: Distinguish between new words and the general meaning of the text. (Those that can be expressed in pictures are expressed in pictures.) The order of various aspects is determined by the four members Zhang Meisun, Ji Xiaobo, Shi Chongpeng, and Shi Lianhuang. (7) Textbook classification: There is no need to edit separately for farmers, workers, and women (select) a common vocabulary for public application.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiyuan Returns to Shanghai to Discuss the Exhibition in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Filipinos Have Limited Knowledge of Chinese Art, President of the Philippine University's Art Academy Exchanges a Painting, and Plans to Send Students to China to Study Art</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jiyuan, Vice President of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, has completed his trip to the Philippines to hold a Chinese modern calligraphy and painting exhibition. He returned to Shanghai with the tourist group to the Philippines a few days ago. A Shanghai News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Wang at his residence yesterday to learn about the exhibition and the art situation in the Philippines. The exhibition's progress, according to Mr. Wang, was aimed at communicating Chinese and Filipino culture, fostering friendship with neighboring countries, and raising funds to build a new campus for the art academy. A total of 300 calligraphy and painting works were brought and exhibited at the Manila Oriental Club and the Chinese Youth Association on the 13th of last month. On the opening day, consuls from various countries attended the ceremony, which was quite grand. The number of visitors was also exceptionally crowded. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on the 18th, but it was extended to the 23rd at the request of various circles. About 200 paintings and calligraphy works were sold, and the remaining pieces were managed by the Overseas Chinese Education Association.</p>
<p>Art in the Philippines: The Philippines has only made progress in culture in the last hundred years, so its art is quite immature. Due to the lack of promotion of Chinese art in the Philippines in the past, its understanding is quite limited. There were questions about calligraphy and light ink paintings because of their simple colors and high prices. This is generally evident. Their understanding of Western painting is also very immature. The style is from the 17th century, with European colors still passed down by the Spanish. Therefore, in terms of new and artistic styles, China is ahead of the Philippines. Furthermore, it is difficult to find paper, ink, brushes, and inkstones for Chinese calligraphy and painting. Most of the interior decorations in civilian homes are enlarged photographs in frames for hanging, with no calligraphy or paintings. Therefore, after holding the exhibition in the Philippines this time, it has left a deep impression on the Filipinos.</p>
<p>Philippine University Art Academy: The Art Academy of the University of the Philippines is the highest institution for studying art in the Philippines. Its buildings and scale are quite grand. The Dean, Lilaroso, is a famous figure in the Philippines. The school studies Western painting, not Chinese painting. There are also two or three Chinese students studying at the school, but because their parents are engaged in business in the Philippines, they study commercial applied arts, sculpture patterns, and the like. I visited the school and found that both male and female students must wear clothes, which shows their backward thinking. However, music, dance, and drama are quite developed.</p>
<p>Exchange of Paintings: The Dean of the Art Academy of the University of the Philippines exchanged a framed Western painting with Wang Jiyuan's "Landscape and Wild Rain Picture." The exchange ceremony was presided over by the President of the University of the Philippines, Bugobo. This is the starting point of Chinese-Philippine cultural exchange. The painting of the Dean is now stored in the library of the University of the Philippines, and the painting of Wang Jiyuan is stored in the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. The University of the Philippines also plans to send students to China to study Eastern culture. The general comment on Chinese painting after this exhibition was: "Flowers represent the four seasons of China, ladies and gentlemen represent the ethnic costumes of Chinese dynasties, and landscapes represent the transcendence of Chinese national thought, and the hanging of Chinese paintings from top to bottom is a sign of transcendence."</p>

<h3>Cultural Construction Monthly, Issue 6, Published</h3>
<p>Rich and Comprehensive Cultural News</p>
<p>In the past two months, two events in China's cultural circles have been most noteworthy. One is the declaration of the Ten Professors on January 10th, advocating the establishment of a Chinese-based culture with an attitude of not clinging to the old and not blindly following. The other is the reading competition initiated by the China Cultural Construction Association, hoping to create a good learning atmosphere. Regarding these two events, the former occurred earlier and has now reached an important stage of development. The latter, although it happened recently, has also made considerable progress. Detailed information is included in the recently published Volume 1, Issue 6 of the Cultural Construction Monthly. This issue includes a record of the Capital Chinese-Based Cultural Construction Symposium, recording the opinions of people in the capital's cultural circles on the construction of a Chinese-based culture. There is a Chinese Culture Discussion section, such as Li Jianfang's "Characteristics of Chinese Cultural Development," Zhang Jinjian's "Special Qualities of Chinese Culture," Fan Zhongyun's "A Discussion on Chinese Cultural Construction from the History of Cultural Development," and Shen Yan's "Review of the Problem of Restoring the Inherent Culture," discussing Chinese culture, each with unique insights. There is "The Origin of the Reading Competition," detailing the purpose of the China Cultural Construction Association's initiation of this event and methods for encouraging reading. The beginning of the volume also includes a call for submissions advertisement for Chinese-based cultural construction and a membership solicitation advertisement for the Reading Competition. All those who wish to understand the progress of the two major events in China's cultural circles recently and who wish to obtain submission prizes and reading prizes should purchase and read it as soon as possible, as sales of the publication have recently surged, and delays may lead to regret. It is heard that starting from Volume 1, Issue 7, the content and form of the publication will be further refined to meet the elegant expectations of readers.</p>

The game started at 8:00 PM. The Lim Long court was filled with spectators. According to the Philippine Allied Forces, it is a strong and powerful team formed by the Philippines and the United States. The Philippine sprinter, Au Qika, who will attend the World Games, also participated in the competition. His sprints were unmatched throughout the stadium, and his shooting was also accurate. He is the cornerstone of the Philippine Allied Forces. The strength is quite strong, causing the overseas Chinese audience to worry about the Two Rivers team. The tension of the battle was expected. The game started at 8:00 PM, and the battle was very tense. Because Pan Meng committed two fouls, the Min team launched a strong attack and opened the scoring. The three Chens of the Two Rivers team were not willing to be outdone. They worked together to break the duck egg. From then on, both sides were cautious and fought for points. Bao Shuxia blocked and dribbled the ball, and Hu Zuoqiong accelerated and galloped. In a flash, the score gradually increased. You were brave and I was fierce. The first half ended with the Two Rivers team leading 14 to 8. After the break, the team made a comeback. The Two Rivers team finally used its experience and rapid passing, five tigers attacking, and effective defense. The score soared.

<h3>Securities: The Bullish Outlook for Securities Is Unlikely to Last</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw the market gradually weakening, and selling sentiment seemed to be increasing. Selling was most prevalent in the No. 4 issue, with selling occurring in each item and each lot. It was rumored that the selling came from a powerful player, and market participants attempted to push the price up several times but were ultimately suppressed. The northern syndicate also sold more than they bought, with most issues opening lower, generally falling by 2, 3, or 5 points. Selling was particularly heavy in the No. 4 issue, with retail investors buying in large quantities. The No. 53 issue was the only one with significant buying interest for the 20-roll issue. In the second lot, the front-row issues continued to fall by about 1 or 2 points. Starting with the distant salt tax issue, retail investors' buying appetite intensified again, and the price rebounded by 3 or 4 points. However, the No. 4 issue continued to be sold. The afternoon session opened with slightly less selling in the No. 4 issue, and scattered buyers were extremely active. The market sentiment turned firm, with a considerable prospect of recovery. The unified salt tax issue surged by about half a yuan. However, the rally proved unsustainable at the close, with the northern syndicate and the No. 4 issue continuing to sell. The front-row issues were firm, but after the 20-roll issue, they all tended to weaken. The current month's salt tax issue fell back by 4 points. In terms of the trend, if the environment does not improve, the market will either fall or move sideways. In summary, the market price results showed a uniform weakening of 1, 2, or up to 3, 5 points. The total trading volume was 15,535,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Affected by Cotton</h3>
<p>Uniform Plunge: Record New Low for the Year</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (the 11th), the New York stock market saw heavy selling pressure, and prices plunged, reaching a new low for the year. The market was affected by the sharp fall in cotton. The fall in cotton was entirely due to rumors, especially rumors that the government's cotton loan would not continue. Agricultural stocks were among the hardest hit, as they are directly related to the reduction in income for cotton farmers. Another reason for the stock market decline, and one that particularly affected gold and silver stocks, was the Ministry of Finance's recall of government bonds, which naturally led to the cancellation of banknotes issued by federally chartered banks. Wall Street speculators recognized this as further proof of the government's avoidance of inflation. The bond market and small exchanges followed other markets downstream, and grains were also affected by the same factors. The total trading volume for the day was 800,000 shares.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The World Cotton Market Is Undergoing Dramatic Changes; The Decline in Yarn and Cotton Prices Is Still Not Excessive</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced a decline in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, but the overall situation is still strong. The spring sales of spot yarn have picked up, and purchases by various syndicates continue to improve, although they are less than the previous day, so people's minds are calm. However, the US cotton market has experienced a huge decline, a worrying situation not seen in a year. However, a certain bull continues to buy and add to his position in standard yarn. Amidst the turbulent tide of the world cotton industry, his outlook can be described as heroic.</p>
<p>Bullishness Relies on Heavy Addition to Positions</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, showing signs of panic, as the 1.2-cent line for US cotton was suddenly broken, causing some fear in the market. Unexpectedly, as the market fell, it was rumored that a certain bull had come to buy and add to his position in the near month, and the price rebounded. However, most followers, in view of the turbulence in the world cotton market, liquidated many bull positions. As a result, the prices of standard yarn for all months fell by 8, 9 cents to 1.2, 3, 4 cents. The afternoon session opened tighter, and it was heard that sales of spot yarn were still strong in various markets. Shorts covered their positions, and the market rose. This month's price rose by 1 yuan, and the distant month's price rose by 1.2, 4, 6 cents. It was found that 1,550 bales of Suilong were sold, 2,450 bales of Daji, 1,650 bales of Zhenda, 1,700 bales of Ruidai, 850 bales of Hengde, 1,650 bales of Shenji, 2,500 bales of Yichang, 1,150 bales of Dachang, 3,250 bales of Xincheng, and 800 bales of Yuanda. 4,250 bales of Changfeng, 2,350 bales of Dafu, 2,000 bales of Tongji, 1,200 bales of Yida, 1,350 bales of Yuanyi, 1,000 bales of Taichang, and 900 bales of Mingde were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Inventory</p>
<p>March 179.8 178.7 179.8 Up 0.20 33,500</p>

<p>August 183.9 183.2 183.7 0.80 16,550</p>
<p>Total 215,500</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Strong</p>
<p>The spot yarn market is still good. It was found that various syndicates purchased a total of 2,500 bales throughout the day. The market was flat. Customer syndicate purchases were as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 190 Changsha 430 Weihaiwei 250 Inland 150</p>
<p>Guangdong 730 Tianjin 305 Shantou 165 Ningbo 15</p>
<p>Same Industry 75 Yunnan 140 Jiangxi 90</p>
<p>The cotton market is weakening, and the decline is gradually intensifying. The American cotton market has experienced a shocking decline, and the world cotton industry is showing signs of unrest. The Indian cotton gray market has also fallen by more than ten rupees. However, the local cotton market is still able to maintain itself, and the decline has not been drastic. The majority of people's minds are still settled, but the overseas cotton market is still poor.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Benefited from Short Covering</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, with each month showing signs of weakness. The American cotton market plunged by more than one hundred pounds, and the Indian cotton gray market fell sharply by more than ten rupees, causing shock to people's minds. Bull positions were liquidated en masse. The distant months saw new lows. As a result, each month fell by 6.5 cents to 7.5 cents. The afternoon market was calm, with no major changes. Some people predicted that there would be a rebound tomorrow. Short covering led to profits. However, the trend of the world cotton industry is so dangerous. While Dongyang Sanpin cotton has fallen sharply by more than two yuan, the future of local cotton still faces the prospect of a decline. It was found that 5,800 bales of Yuanda were sold, 4,800 bales of Zhenda, 3,300 bales of Dafeng, 4,400 bales of Gengfeng, 4,200 bales of Shenji, 8,800 bales of Yichang, 4,700 bales of Run, 2,500 bales of Yikang, 2,900 bales of Changhe, 2,300 bales of Meiji, and 2,800 bales of Changyu. 12,200 bales of Dafu, 2,900 bales of Jifeng, 3,600 bales of Tongji, 2,200 bales of Yuanyi, 2,800 bales of Hengchang, 7,900 bales of Shengyuan, 6,500 bales of Suilong, and 3,200 bales of Dafu, 2,200 bales of Changfeng were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Inventory</p>
<p>March 34.20 34.05 34.20 Up 0.55 68,500</p>

<p>Total 643,600</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Large Quantities Go Out but Still Scarce</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is sluggish, and large-volume transactions are quiet. As the prices of US and Indian cotton approach each other, it is said in the market that Japanese merchants are purchasing several hundred pieces of US cotton Mit Mit at 51 yuan. Indian cotton, Plain Guol, 3,000 pieces at 30 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Variety .00 Shenxin Factory Purchased 150 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>East Ditch Cotton 40.75 Also 500 Bales Also Also</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 42.50 Also 500 Bales Also Also</p>
<p>East Tai Cotton 41.50 Also 500 Bales Also Also</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 42.00 Xinyu Factory Purchased 500 Bales Also Also</p>
<h3>New Cotton Policy Hesitant and Undecided: US Cotton Suddenly Plunges by More Than One Hundred Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was weak. Prices for each month fell by 3 to 10 pounds. Subsequently, brokers and cotton farmers engaged in active hedging, and the government was hesitant and undecided about the new cotton policy. The market price gradually declined. Penk Heisheng stated that the government's remedial new cotton policy would not increase to more than 10.5 million bales, and he said that when the government supports closing new cotton at 5 million bales, the selling spree would be slightly reduced. Unfortunately, large quantities of cotton from various places were piled up in the market, causing old bulls to reluctantly liquidate their positions. Finally, due to purchases by peers, short covering, and rumors of government assistance, a slight rebound was seen. However, the market trend was still uncertain. It is estimated that spot cotton fell by 100 pounds, and futures fell by 16 to 119 pounds. The British cotton market was weak, with spot cotton falling by 3 points and futures falling by 6 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to selling by Japanese merchants, but later rebounded due to purchases by a few speculators. It is estimated that Plain Guol rose by 2.25 rupees, Olarm rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 1.75 rupees. The original telegraphic record is on the left (telegraphic on the 11th):</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to National Currency British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Converted to National Currency</p>

<p>Bai Luoxi 138.25 2.75 32.90</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bai Luoxi cotton on the 12th was 200 rupees, a decrease of 16.25 rupees compared to the closing on the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rangoon Cotton Export Volume</h3>
<p>According to a Mengmao dispatch on the 11th, the total amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 4,573 bales, 228 bales to Hamburg, 725 bales to Liverpool, 225 bales to Tris, 3,300 bales to Kobe, and 100 bales to Yokohama.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Price Without Hope of Increase</h3>
<p>Jiujiang has a small amount of refined rice going out, and domestic demand is declining.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market saw a further decline in domestic sales, and hoarders, due to financial constraints, were more willing to sell at the market price. Therefore, all grades, high and low, were uniformly weakening, down 3 to 5 points from the previous market. Furthermore, inventories were abundant, and sources were endless, so the market is still viewed as declining. However, yesterday the Japanese district was slightly active, and the Jiujiang syndicate also had 1,300 bales of small refined rice transactions, so the market stabilized. The city opened with more than 9,000 bales of spot imported rice, 100 bales of customer Xian rice, 50 bales of customer Yuan rice, and 200 tons of forward imported rice.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Sesame Transaction Opens at 200 Tons</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms opened sesame transactions for 200 tons at a price of nine yuan original weight. British merchants purchased them. Currently, demand remains active, suggesting a stable outlook. Although there is demand from various districts in Henan and Anhui, the demand capacity is weak, and the market atmosphere has not been stimulated. Therefore, yesterday's prices continued to drop slightly by two or three cents. It is estimated that there were over a thousand bags of Guizhou beans. Please refer to the market price column for market trends. There were two cars of Bengbu beans, one car of Bozhou beans, one car of Yingzhou beans, three hundred bags of Dangshan beans, and over eight hundred bags of Hankou newly harvested beans.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea – Chinese Silk Merchants Urgently Need Reform</h3>
<p>—Silk Exports Are Unmentionable—</p>
<p>Recently, the silk market for foreign goods and users has been quiet and listless. Overseas orders for White Filature B grade are only priced at 420 yuan. Manufacturers are unwilling to sell due to high costs. The Indian coarse silk market is also struggling due to competition from Japanese goods. Therefore, since the beginning of the year, exports have been very dismal. According to a Chinese manager of a certain export firm, the business practices of China's silk industry should change with the times. Otherwise, there will be no place for Chinese silk in the world market. The quality of reeling is not worth discussing.</p>
<h3>Metals – Large Bars of Pig Lead Arrive, Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>The market for large bars of pig lead has been sluggish recently. Although the new tea season is approaching, the silver market is currently tight. Furthermore, the sales of tea last year by foreign firms were not good, resulting in poor results. Therefore, they are unwilling to lend generously to tea merchants this year. The demand from paint companies, red lead factories, and type-casting workshops is limited because they purchased too much last time. The overall market is soft due to poor sales. However, the arrival of goods is abundant, leading to large stockpiles. The standard price has fallen from 14.34 yuan to 14 yuan. However, immediate cash purchases and forward sales prices are still one or two cents lower. It is reported that only two to three hundred bars have been traded daily, and the buyers are mostly Tianjin merchants and Tunxi tea merchants. According to insiders, if the tea business does not flourish, the prospects for the lead market this year are unlikely to improve. Hunan native lead has also been affected by the sluggish sales of foreign lead, with the current market price at 13.34 yuan. It is estimated that only forty to fifty bars have been traded.</p>
<h3>Oil Market – White Tung Oil Continues to Rise in Hankou</h3>
<p>Since the surge in white tung oil last week, the situation has become increasingly stable. Hankou dealers added to the price, selling at 35.40 yuan per picul according to foreign regulations. By last week, the price stabilized. After entering this week, the market has risen again. According to reports from Hankou in the past two days, foreign firms have been buying at over 36 yuan. This high price has not been seen since the adoption of the foreign exchange standard and is the highest in the last three or four years. According to Hankou firms, inventories are extremely low, making it difficult for foreign firms stationed in Hankou to purchase large quantities. Recently, Hankou firms have gradually increased the number of inbound cargo ships. Xiangyang tung oil has been traded at around 29 yuan, and southern branch tung oil is even above 29 yuan, both according to customer regulations. This is because Xiangyang tung oil had a slightly lower density due to the weather last winter, so the selling price was cheaper than southern branch tung oil, which is also a change in the market. Zhejiang tung oil has also risen along with the Hankou market. It is reported that the price of standard density oil in Hangzhou has increased to over 33 yuan. Although there are no large-scale transactions for foreign firms in this port, sporadic purchases of thirty to fifty tons are still heard from time to time. This is because Shanghai's exports rely entirely on Zhejiang tung oil, and the output of Zhejiang province is insufficient to supply such a large volume of foreign sales. Therefore, firms in this port engaged in direct export trade are afraid to pre-sell large quantities.</p>
<h3>Semi-Annual Worldwide Cotton Industry Statistics</h3>
<p>Reuters reported from Memphis on the 11th that statistics for the worldwide cotton industry from August 1, 1934, to January 31, 1935, were less favorable than the same period last year. The figures are recorded below (in thousands of units):</p>
<p>Ending January 30, 1934 Ending July 31, 1934 Ending January 31, 1935</p>
<p>Cotton Consumption 12,534 12,578 12,207</p>
<p>Cotton Inventory 5,268 5,337 4,763</p>
<p>Active Spindles 157,718 156,878 155,031</p>
<h3>Grain – Sunny Spring Benefits Wheat Seedling Development – Forward Flour and Wheat Weakest</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, prices for all months showed a consistent decline. Foreign wheat quotations showed a large drop of five to six cents in Chicago and about eight cents in Canada. At the opening price, foreign wheat quotations also included news that factories had continued to order a ship of Australian wheat at a price of 4.70 yuan. Although the current month remains unusually popular due to the ready availability of flour, market sentiment is largely weak, especially for forward months. Therefore, this morning's results showed a small decrease of one cent for near-term contracts and a small decrease of two cents for distant contracts. At the afternoon opening, internal and external sentiment was not optimistic. Forward months were pressured by news of excellent wheat seedling growth in the interior, leading to selling pressure. The market again showed a downturn, affecting the current month's market, which also showed weakness. Under the current circumstances, unless there are special changes, a downward trend is expected. The results were a decrease of two cents for the current month, a decrease of four cents and two and a half mills for the April/May months, a decrease of four cents for the June month, a decrease of three cents and seven and a half mills for the July month, and a decrease of four and a half cents for the August month.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market this morning, prices for all months showed a consistent decline. Foreign wheat quotations showed a drop of about five to six cents in Chicago and eight cents in Canada. After the opening price, recent transactions remained quiet, while forward months saw prices decline due to the drop in foreign wheat and excellent weather conditions in domestic wheat-producing regions, resulting in good seedling development. Afternoon trading was still active, with prices similar to the morning. The results were a decrease of six cents for the current month, a decrease of seven cents for the April month, and a decrease of eight cents for the July/August months. The current wheat market remains strong due to good factory demand and customer purchases, with prices remaining stable. Shandong wheat opened at 3.77 yuan, and Yingzhou Yaowan wheat opened at 3.767 yuan.</p>

<h3>Medium-Grade White Indica Rice Exceptionally Good, Up One Dime</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of twenty-five or twenty-six boats arrived from various sources (over four thousand stones of cargo). Sales were slow initially but picked up later, so the market color was weak at first but then stabilized. In the end, even after a long period of weakness, it was still difficult to break even. The price of thick indica rice continued to depreciate by five cents, and although there were sudden purchases of a thousand or so bags of late rice such as Yantai Weihaiwei, the market also saw a step-by-step increase of several cents. The price of nearly new, Du Yang tip rice was unchanged due to similar supply and demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, few boats arrived from various routes along the river, about ten or so. Sales of various goods on the market were average. Medium-grade white indica rice was scarce, causing the price to rise by ten cents. The market price of thin rice was slightly down by a small number of cents in the afternoon, and the prices of other goods were also slightly stable. However, the price of white yuan rice sold for retail purposes was increased by five or six cents.</p>

<h3>On Activist Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Since André Malraux received the Prix Goncourt, activist literature has gained worldwide attention, and his masterpiece, "Man's Fate" (La Condition Humaine), has become a favorite among readers. Some have compared the value of this book to the only stinging creation since Nietzsche.</p>
<p>The rise of activist literature in today's literary world is an excellent reflection of the global trend among the intellectual class, especially as it emerges from the world of pure art. It is particularly significant and flavorful to see it emerge in the French literary world, known for its fragrant artistic atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a result of World War I, the French intellectual class suffered an incurable spiritual blow. Therefore, in postwar France, despair dominated the intellectual class, along with a fondness for mysterious, bizarre, and unrealistic psychology. This ideology continued to be maintained along with the relative prosperity under the stable French franc.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the intensification of the global panic, the general middle class in France has deeply felt that life is mired in a quagmire. This "life hardship" has caused everyone to jump out of the swamp of despair and seek a way out for themselves, as seen in the cases of André Gide and Fernandez.</p>
<p>In this situation, the general intellectual class abandoned liberalism and began to advocate and promote activism. These so-called activists advocate a positive and affirmative attitude to replace a negative and rejecting one. They not only observe but also value action. Furthermore, activism advocates that action is the overflow of the entire life.</p>
<p>This activism has certain limits, which can be said to be its foundation, built on the philosophy of Henri Bergson. This may be an overstatement, but at least this activism is indeed related to Bergson's philosophy. Bergson's philosophy is the "philosophy of life." He said that "reality" never repeats itself but is an endless stream of life that is constantly created and transformed. However, thinking abstracts this concrete reality of endless flow and turns it into something fixed. So-called matter is merely a fixed state of the flow of life. The dualism of mind and matter can be unified by the monism of consciousness, so the concept of "élan vital" is at the core of his thought. The error in this philosophy is very obvious. Therefore, French activist literature, guided by this philosophy, cannot completely settle the past nihilism, blind faith, and Fauvism.</p>
<p>Activism is often misunderstood, or rather, it is often used to whitewash one's own depravity. Although French activism is not yet perfect, it is at least a valuable product of the intellectual class's attempt to rescue themselves from a state of doubt and self-abandonment. However, this activism often falls into the hands of a few people, who treat it as a panacea for the intellectual class. Because the intellectual class is a middle layer, many people strongly emphasize the so-called "special qualities" of the intellectual class, its dynamism. This dynamism can be understood as "doing as one pleases" and standing in a "guiding position." Although "doing as one pleases" has some limitations, namely, being limited to following the correct direction of history, this is self-justification and still the old liberalism. As for "guiding position," to put it clearly, it means standing in a guiding position. This attempt to establish the omnipotent status of the intellectual class by borrowing the banner of activism simply dismembers activism.</p>
<p>True activism, as I said above, replaces a negative and rejecting attitude with a positive and affirmative one. Not only that, but it must also abandon Bergson's "philosophy of life" and build on a correct worldview. Although all current realities are very complex and unfree, the trajectories of pursuing contradictions are all similar. Therefore, I believe that it is also possible for human beings to engage in mutual social criticism. In this situation, it is necessary to fully recognize the regressive historical trends. The social movement and progress follow the steady progress of the intellectual class and present a new posture. By reversing the heavy pressure added to oneself, one can better obtain the practical action of seeking truth.</p>
<p>Here, let's talk about activist literature again! So-called activist literature can simply be called literature full of the spirit of activism. The author's own unease and the images of various real-world sufferings are not merely materials for the writer to think about but can be used as materials for the writer to organize, analyze, and practice. André Malraux once said at a lecture: "If the writer is a skilled technician, we must never forget that the highest function of the technician is invention. Art is not obedience; art is a conqueror." At the same time, in his maiden work, "The Conquerors," he simply compared himself to a conqueror. In this thought, we can see the promotion of better development of art, and in this, fully express the passion to approach the reality of society and one's own artistic claims.</p>
<p>Activist literature does not contain extremely mechanical political meaning, but it is also not Bogdanov's culturalism. It tears apart and abandons the attitude of isolating the author from reality and thoroughly experiences reality. It is not merely experiencing but using the rich knowledge of the intellectual class to do the work of analysis and dissection. We believe that with the outstanding ability of the intellectual class, coupled with their practical experience, the achievements of this struggle for all truth are indeed remarkable. The writer who holds this activist spirit and produces creations for the expression of all images will inevitably be able to truly reflect reality and have progressive qualities.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Park</h3>
<p>— Nishimura</p>
<p>Jiangnan Park gets its name because the park site is located on the south bank of the Songhua River, opposite the city of Jilin and the area of Sandao Pier on the north bank.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Park is unique in that it does not charge admission fees. Thinking about it, I guess all the parks in Northeast China don't charge admission fees, right? Only in this way is it truly a "public" park, a "public" park in name and in fact. Otherwise, a "public" park watched by police at the gate, where no one can enter without a ticket, should actually be a "private" park.</p>
<p>The way to get to Jiangnan Park is to take a boat from Sandao Pier. This kind of boat is specially used for ferrying between Jiangnan and Jiangbei, but it's not a sampan like in the south. It's called a "Little Weihu," long and narrow with pointed ends instead of square ones. To give an analogy, if you cut a long, thin cucumber in half lengthwise and remove the seeds, that's a miniature "Little Weihu."</p>
<p>The park gate faces north and can be seen from the boat. But the plaque on the gate doesn't say "Jiangnan Park." This used to be an agricultural experiment station, and the old sign hasn't been removed yet.</p>
<p>Around the park gate, there are some vendors selling snacks, stalls, melons, soda, and tea are the main items, and cigarettes and sugar balls are also indispensable. There is also a "talking box" in the teahouse. Sometimes this thing opens its big mouth and shouts randomly for a while, and sometimes it emits a delicate and charming female voice, which can attract the attention of some tourists.</p>
<p>After entering the park, the usual practice is to walk east along the willow-shaded path, but in my opinion, it's better to go west, turn south, and pass through some fruit trees, where you can see some wild animals. There is also a basketball court and parallel bars here, where athletes and martial arts masters can show off their skills. Two rows of old houses exude a strong musty smell, which may evoke a sense of aging.</p>
<p>Turning back to the east, you'll arrive in front of a two-story hall. This is where the director of the agricultural experiment station used to work. If you know the director and plan to host friends and relatives in the park, the hall can be borrowed, and it's free. But there is no restaurant or snack shop here, so you must bring all the food and drink with you from Jiangnan. The windows of the building are level with the willow branches. Looking into the distance, the south is a flat field, and behind it winds a series of mountains. To the east, the Immortal Cave area is a belt of low hills, but behind the hills, a series of high mountains still emerge. The Songhua River flows from the southwest and turns to the northeast, reflecting the mountains and hills, and set against the azure sky, your gaze will evoke some pleasure.</p>
<p>Exiting the east gate of the agricultural experiment station, there is a small flower garden to the north outside the gate. If you say you're here to stroll through the park, it's better to say you're here to stroll through the flower garden. Upon entering the flower garden, there is a pool of water with a layer of lotus leaves floating on it. Outside the pool are square flower beds. Behind the flower beds is a long row of greenhouses, partially built underground, with roofs covered entirely in glass, which is where the flowers are kept in the winter.</p>
<p>In the flower garden, as far as the eye can see, there are all kinds of flowers, which are extremely beautiful. The fragrance floats in the air, bees and butterflies fly among the flowers, and people in this situation cannot but feel the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>Two thatched pavilions stand in the flower bushes, dilapidated and tilted, so mismatched with the competing flower bushes! Ivy climbs from all over the pavilion along the ropes tied to the roof, all the way to the top of the pavilion, often blocking the wind that blows through the holes in the pavilion.</p>
<p>Behind the pavilion is a grove of poplars, and outside the grove is a sandy beach, with red and green intertwined, and the sparkling river water, which is quite an interesting scene.</p>
<p>Leaving the flower garden and heading east is the woodland area. From the nameplates, you can learn what is called German locust, what is called American poplar, and some other trees. I would rather stroll under the trees than admire the flowers in the flower garden. The gorgeous and fragrant flowers are not as good as the majestic and aloof woodland area.</p>
<p>Having walked here, you have already walked the entire garden. It's time to go back to the city. Walking a few more steps east, you can cross the river from Xiaodongmen to the opposite bank of the wave mouth and return to the city.</p>
<h3>Climbing Mount Jing</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>In Huaiyuan, Mount Jing and Mount Tu are somewhat famous. It is said that Mount Tu is even more desolate. Since it is desolate, one must go and play in a desolate place once! In China, desolate places and barren mountains are everywhere! I want to find another opportunity to also go and see the desolate Mount Tu.</p>
<p>That day, we went to Mount Jing, four of us together, walking from the streets of Huaiyuan. Before long, we arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Although the sky was overcast, our mood for climbing the mountain was sunny.</p>
<p>On the mountainside, we found a mountain spring. The spring water was milky white. Above the spring, a stone was carved with the two red characters "Milky Spring." The characters were vigorous and powerful, but there was no date or name of the calligrapher to be found. Next to the spring, in a clearing under the shade of the trees, an ancient-looking Taoist was fanning the fire next to a stove. The water was from the Milky Spring. Every day, he scooped up the milky white water from the spring, one bamboo tube after another, to make tea. The Taoist's life is finite. Could he possibly scoop the Milky Spring dry?</p>
<p>Climbing up the mountainside to the Wanghuai Tower, the architecture of the tower was not at all elegant, fitted with dilapidated glass windows, neither Chinese nor Western. What does it look like? It's really hard to say. Inside the tower were placed tea tables, chairs, and couches, and the walls were covered with couplets. At the time, I read them all once, but when I came back, I couldn't remember them halfway, except that I remembered that the lower half of one couplet had "Su Zi came to visit." Checking the local chronicles, Su Dongpo, the witty and eccentric figure from the Song Dynasty, had also visited. Mount Jing is still the Mount Jing of those days, but our poet has long turned to dust! A little bit of sorrow touched my heart.</p>
<p>Wanghuai Tower, as the name suggests, tells you that climbing the tower to look at the Huai River is the best thing to do. There is a short railing in front of the tower. Leaning on the railing, you send your gaze into the distance. The Huai River's thousand miles of sparkling waves, the sails on the water standing like a forest, the whistles of small steamships, drifting leisurely in the wind. In this situation, you can't help but praise the magnificence of the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>I looked down the Huai River. I looked at the boundless horizon, looking until the end of the earth, unable to see my hometown in the south! Some smoky sorrows struck my heart. I suddenly remembered a fragmented sentence from Du Fu.</p>
<p>—Across the sea, the brothers are separated by the dust of war,</p>
<p>At the end of the earth, tears and snot, just myself, alone and far!</p>
<p>The Taoist on the mountain brought up the tea brewed from the Milky Spring. The tea was fragrant and clear, but we were vulgar people who didn't understand how to appreciate tea. In our hectic lives, could we possibly have the mood of an "elegant person"?</p>
<p>The clouds of dusk blurred the sky. We didn't have the courage to climb the high peak.</p>
<p>February 23, 1935, in Huaiyuan.</p>
<h3>Hater of Servility (Cont. 2)</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>"I told you, she could go a whole day without speaking. My little daughter was always out playing in the streets, and at that time, I had learned to speak to women very softly and gently, so you could hear the chickens clucking in the house, but no human voices. Alas, if it weren't for that festering sore on my leg, maybe I'd have a little more respect for the women now!" He sighed, then started to calculate the days in his head, and continued... "That sore festered for five months, and I couldn't move at all. The money ran out. My second wife and daughter, just like when they first came, had faces like vegetable leaves from the trash can, covered with worried wrinkles. I'd often pat the bed and tell her to relax: "What's the big deal?... When everyone can't move anymore, we'll all just lie in bed together."...</p>
<p>"Finally, one day, I shouted myself hoarse, but they didn't even bother to look at me, and they never came back..."</p>
<p>His hand, clutching the chopsticks, was raised in the air, trembling in space as if he couldn't put it down. His gray eyes were full of cruel, cold light. Anger drove the old man – his crazed eyes fixed on something on the wall, his arms spread open, slowly and terribly lifting his swollen body. Some of the unclear "heh-heh" sounds that old people often make rolled out of his throat. This action continued for a short while, then he suddenly sat down as if someone had hit him, and then laughed as calmly and emotionlessly as usual.</p>
<p>As I was leaving, I handed him a penny and asked him for a handful of green onions. He casually put the penny in his pocket, picked up the pot, used the tip of his chopsticks to stir the embers in the stove that were almost extinguished, then took another deep sip of wine and smacked his lips in appreciation of the liquor.</p>
<p>But a few steps after I left the door, the old man suddenly shouted loudly from behind:</p>
<p>"Hey, where's the money? You haven't given me the money for the green onions yet." His corroded memory had completely forgotten that he had received the money, and he waved to me anxiously. I walked further away, and I could still vaguely hear him muttering curses... (The End)</p>

<h3>Those Hanlin Scholars and Jinshi Graduates are All Useless Treasures (2)</h3>
<p>— Cao Jurein</p>
<p>Why is it that among those who passed the imperial examinations, none of them truly understood ancient books? The reason is simple: if one truly understood ancient books, one would have no hope of passing the imperial examinations. For example, in the *Analects*, "Confucius said: 'In matters of benevolence, one should not defer even to one's teacher.'" The commentary by Kong Anguo states: "When performing acts of benevolence, one should not defer even to one's teacher, indicating the urgency of practicing benevolence." However, those who read the *Analects* from then on only interpreted "teacher" as "master." During the Northern Song Dynasty, a scholar taking the examination used the old commentary from the Han Dynasty, interpreting it as "In matters of benevolence, one should not defer even to the masses," which was a better interpretation, but he failed the examination because of it. Another example is the line from the *Analects*: "The gentleman is ashamed of his words exceeding his actions." Zhu Xi's commentary states: "Ashamed means not daring to covet; exceeding means desiring to have more than enough." This is clearly a case of interpreting the text literally and talking nonsense. During the Qing Dynasty, a scholar, based on the imperial edition and the Korean edition, corrected the error of "之" in place of "而," but he also failed the examination because of it. You see, if one truly seeks to understand ancient books, how dangerous it is for passing the imperial examinations; having truly understood ancient books, one should never hope to be among those who passed the imperial examinations! When I was young, my father and teacher taught me to read the *Four Books*, only allowing me to read Zhu Xi's commentary and not allowing me to read the Qing Dynasty scholars' textual research. Once, I read He Yan's commentary on the *Analects* and used it to refute Zhu Xi's commentary, and I even received a big thump on the head from my late father! Only now do I understand that they hoped I would not truly understand ancient books to avoid trouble, which was actually a kind intention! With this kind of way of reading ancient books, where "predecessors fart, and successors say it smells good," how can one possibly understand them? Even if Confucius were resurrected, he could only be a fool, right?</p>
<p>Some people think that the top graduates (Zhuangyuan) are always literary stars from heaven, with ten or eight *dou* of talent; presumably, they get this idea from operas and plays. But in reality, the rankings of the top five in the palace examination (commonly referred to as *Zhuangyuan*, *Tanhua*, etc.) are decided early on by the backers who are in the know (the story goes that anyone who hopes to be among the top three are all pulled in as disciples by nobles in the court). The quality of the writing has nothing to do with it. Palace examination essays have a fixed range of topics, and the number of words is limited by the emperor's decree, so "newcomers from the grass roots" are never allowed to express any opinions. In palace examination papers, the level of the opening lines and the words to be avoided are much more important than the quality of the writing. Among the six hundred *Zhuangyuan*, we have never seen any works of lasting value passed down. Not only are there no works of lasting value, but if the *Zhuangyuan* later truly studies and is able to write something, he will undoubtedly feel like vomiting for three days after reading his own palace examination paper—that's how useless the *Zhuangyuan* are.</p>
<p>Below the level of *Zhuangyuan*, such as *Juren*, *Jinshi*, and Hanlin scholars, it goes without saying that they "do not understand ancient books" and their "writing is poor." As the predecessors said, "Don't discuss literature in the examination hall." The standard for judging essays in the examination hall is the correctness of the calligraphy and the appropriateness of the format, which has nothing to do with the quality of the essay itself. Jiang Chenying, a classical prose writer of the early Qing Dynasty, was highly respected for a time, and Wei Shuzi praised him as being "among the purest and most sincere." However, he failed the examinations several times because his writing deviated from the formal requirements of the examination hall. Later, he took the examination at the Ministry of Rites and again violated the format. The examiner, unwilling to lose such a talent, corrected his paper, and he finally became a *Jinshi*. This was only because the Kangxi Emperor intentionally helped him succeed; otherwise, wouldn't he have remained a scholar all his life? Below the level of *Juren*, such as *Xiucai* and *Gongsheng*, it is exactly like:</p>
<p>"Three sentences to answer the question, two sentences to break the question, wagging your head and shaking your body, you are a high-ranking disciple of the sage. But do you know what kind of writing it is to pass three or four times, and which dynasty did Han Gaozu and Tang Taizong belong to? On the desk is a tall lecture, and in the shop, one buys the latest examination aids. Reading it makes one's shoulders high and low, and one's mouth sighs. Chewing sugarcane dregs over and over, what flavor is there? Wasting time, one is confused for a lifetime. Even if he deceives himself into high office, it is bad luck for the people and the court." – Xu Lingtai: *Hui Xi Dao Qing*. There is no need to talk about reading and understanding ancient books and literature.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shouruo)</p>
<p>Now is a world of scientific civilization, and everything has standard inventions: such as standard beauties, standard cigarettes, standard time, etc., which are said to be the best achievements of scientific civilization. However, the lack of something that science cannot remedy is that there is no standard invention for the human heart!</p>
<p>I think the saying "Everything requires patience" should be differentiated: things that are trivial and without value to haggle over, patience is acceptable: things that are important and have value to haggle over, patience is not acceptable. However, when my negotiating power is not strong enough, and I anticipate not getting a victory, I must also endure temporarily, preparing my strength to seize the opportunity to win: it is not to say that everything, regardless of size, should be met with patience and without haggling.</p>
<p>The inkstone heart was not originally black, but because of its proximity to the ink, it became black as well! As the saying goes: "One who is near vermilion gets stained red, and one who is near ink gets stained black." If one is not careful, one will be influenced. When we conduct ourselves in society, we must also take this as a warning and guard against the temptations of all colors!</p>
<h3>Dream Talk</h3>
<p>— Hua Binghe</p>
<p>I often have fantasies, assuming that I could be like Chunyu Fen in "The Story of the Governor of Nanke," becoming the son-in-law of the king of the Huai'an Kingdom and the governor of Nanke County, allowing a poor boy to vent his anger. Although it is a spring dream, everything in the world can be viewed as such.</p>
<p>The story of a scholar from Fengyang in *Liaozhai Zhiyi* describes a strange dream that can be regarded as a cup of jealousy-curing soup. It and the play *The Secret of a Jealous Woman* performed by the famous actor Gou Huisheng can be said to have their own merits.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan's dream of flowers blooming from his brush has become a cliché of flattery for later generations. I don't know if Mr. Shao Yuanchong of the National Government also dreamed of a very thick brush that bloomed with flowers. He woke up feeling very surprised and ran to tell his wife, Ms. Zhang Mojun. Unexpectedly, Mojun also had the same dream. Later, when the Examination Yuan held its first examination, Yuanchong and Dai Jitao were appointed as chief examiners. To commemorate the auspicious dream, Yuanchong specially named his study "Hall of the Shared Dream of Flowers Blooming from the Brush." This can be regarded as a pleasant anecdote in the unofficial history of the party-state.</p>
<p>Lovers who have been separated for a long time are of course extremely happy when they dream of each other, but they are also very depressed when they wake up. I love the recent poem about dreams by Xi Jianhong and Lao Dan: "It is happy to meet in a dream, and the dream is also happy. It is not easy to meet, and it is difficult to dream of happiness. If you dream of meeting again, do not take it as a dream." It is said so thoroughly and lightly, truly an unsurpassed cooling agent for those in this situation.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Nantong</h3>
<p>— Wuxin</p>
<p>In the Yangtze River, less than dozens of *li* from Nantong, there is a "White Stomach Sand" that rises every day after sunset, like a sandbar, making it impossible for ships to move forward. Only after dawn, when the sand sinks down, can they continue to move forward. The timing of ships departing from Shanghai is always at 11 or 12 o'clock at night, precisely to avoid passing through this area at night. It is said that many domestic and foreign hydraulic experts have no solution to it. The wonders of the world are truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jian did his best to support Mei Lanfang. Therefore, at the foot of Langshan Mountain, a scenic area in Nantong, he built a "Mei Residence" as a place for Mei to rest when he came to Nantong. In the past, this "Mei Residence" was about ten or twenty *li* away from the river, but now it is right next to the river. Therefore, it is expected that this "Mei Residence" will inevitably collapse into the river within a year or two. Many plum trees planted in front of the "Mei Residence" have already been moved away. Truly, the changes of time are rapid!</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates often invaded. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing, they even besieged Nantong with tens of thousands of troops. At that time, a man named Cao Ding led five hundred men and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese pirates, capturing many. However, in the end, he was killed due to the disparity in numbers. At this time of serious national crisis, in order to inspire the national spirit of the people, local people are building a Cao Gong Ancestral Hall.</p>
<h3>Miracle</h3>
<p>— Mei Jinghuo</p>
<p>I accidentally discovered this miracle in a remote tile and rubble field in Zhabei.</p>
<p>A cluster of twenty or thirty simple huts, viewed from a distance, looked like a pile of floating coffins in a field. Less than six feet high, a small hole about two feet wide was the only entrance and exit. The materials of these buildings (?) were entirely the broken walls and ruins of houses bombed by Japanese artillery fire during the Shanghai War, and a few pieces of rusted lead skin that had been abandoned by people.</p>
<p>When I stepped into this damp, dirty area, an unusual stench rushed into my olfactory organs. At the same time, several dove-shaped and stork-faced heads stretched out from the holes, looking at me with suspicious eyes deeply sunken in their sockets. In a flash, they shrank back. Encouraged by curiosity, I leaned down and peered into each hole, as if searching for a miracle. Ah! Could this be a red pill den? Each room had a broken mat, on which were placed small lamps, small boxes, and some scattered items. The users were mostly these ragged, disheveled beggars. Among them was even a female beggar of about twenty years old, who claimed that she had studied at a certain girls' school, but was expelled from her family for becoming addicted to red pills and ended up here. Indeed, she had a snake-like body and prominent hips, but she was not sensual. On her feet, she wore a pair of semi-new high-heeled shoes, like a modern woman, without socks. During the conversation, she even inserted a few sentences of accurately accented English. In my opinion, this cannot be said to be a miracle.</p>
<h3>Ruyi Mulberry</h3>
<p>— (Xia Hu)</p>
<p>It is said that Liu Bei of the Han Dynasty had a mulberry tree that stood tall like a child's umbrella, and the whole village regarded it as a treasure. The people of my hometown, Ganxiang, love to plant mulberry trees, but they only know how to pick the leaves to feed silkworms. They do not know that the branches and berries can also be used to treat diseases. Last summer, a mountain household named Hu from the North-South Lake area presented me with a Ruyi mulberry branch, which was quite peculiar, something I had never seen before. According to him: one evening, while enjoying the cool air in the courtyard, he caught a glimpse of a mulberry tree next to the house, which was emitting a strange light. The next morning, after examining the tree, he found a branch shaped like a Ruyi, flat, white, and covered with mulberry eyes, without a single leaf. He thought that such a strange mulberry branch was inauspicious, so he cut it off with scissors and casually put it into the rice basket. That night, the mulberry branch actually emitted a strange light, with the same brilliance as the night before. Moreover, from a distance, it looked like a mustache, wriggling. The light was emitted from this mustache. Upon closer inspection, he saw that there was indeed a mustache shape at the curved part. He was happy and played with it casually, but the mustache suddenly fell off, and from then on, it never emitted light again. An elderly neighbor over ninety years old said that this was called the Ruyi mulberry, and it should not be viewed too often, as it can cure all diseases.</p>
<p>— (Feng Sunmei's inscription)</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Wenqi from Minhou, also known as Shiquan Sanren, has a passion for collecting ancient coins and has a rich collection. It is now heard that Mr. Yang will donate more than two thousand ancient coins from his collection to the country for research. Once the new site of the Central Museum is completed, he will hand them over in full. The image above was taken during an exhibition at the Shanghai YMCA on New Year's Eve last year.</p>
<h3>Small Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Offending the Lady by Showing Off Wealth in Front of Her, Selecting a Wife by Coveting Her in the Shadows Due to Illness, One Loses Integrity</p>
<p>Yueying couldn't keep a straight face for long while Jia Duocai was admiring her, so she stood up and said: Mom! Can we go now? Madam Zhu Hu heard that Jia Duocai could give some money today, and her eyes were drawn to the pile of silver dollars on the corner of the table, constantly stealing glances at it. Because her eyes were drawn to the silver dollars, her body didn't want to leave, only hoping that Jia Duocai would grab a handful of silver coins and hand them over. However, Jia Duocai only said it but didn't act, and she herself was too embarrassed to leave, so she had to sit here and wait. Now that Yueying said she wanted to leave, she was unwilling to get up, so she said to her: What's the rush? There are still many things to talk about. Yueying raised her eyebrows and said: What else is there to talk about? I don't think it's appropriate for us to say it, and we can't say it well. Why don't you, auntie, say it? Madam Zhu Hu thought that she was too embarrassed to ask for money herself, so it would be good if her sister-in-law asked for it. So she supported herself on the chair and slowly stood up, saying to Jia Duocai: Master Jia, shall we go back? Jia Duocai smiled and took five silver dollars from the pile of silver dollars in his hand and handed them to Zhu Ming, placing them on the edge of the table. He smiled and said: You are honest people, and I can't deceive you. I'll give you this money first. It doesn't matter if things don't work out. I don't care. Madam Zhu Hu responded with "oh, oh" for a while, half-squatting and giving Jia Duocai an Anfu greeting with her hand on her chest. She smiled broadly, looked at him, and was about to thank him. Jia Duocai waved his hand and said: No need, no need. I only know today that your daughter can speak. Since she can speak, that's very good. I'll leave her here to sit for a while and have a heart-to-heart talk to see if she really wants to. There's nothing wrong with that, is there? Madam Zhu Hu felt that there was nothing wrong with it on the one hand, and on the other hand, she had received these five silver dollars, so she was too embarrassed to refuse. So she nodded and said: There's nothing important about that, but I'm afraid she'll be too embarrassed to say it, right? She then wanted to sit down again. (155)</p>
<h3>Glimmers of Imperial Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Or it could be said that this was also a blessing for the Empress Dowager. Fortunately, Heaven did not grant her the ability to foresee the future. Otherwise, if she had known decades later that there would be a worthless thing like Puyi, who would be coerced by the Japanese into singing such a shameless opera in the three northeastern provinces, she would have died of anger long ago. In fact, at that time, Puyi was not even born yet, not to mention that the Empress Dowager would not have thought that he would be a Japanese puppet: even the title of Emperor of the puppet state for three years, she had not yet foreseen!</p>
<p>Upon entering the Summer Palace, all the historically sad flavors were cut off from her because this garden was newly built, and there were no sad memories left yet! And the various flowers that she loved were blooming in full bloom in the garden, which was enough to dispel all the sorrows in her heart. In addition, the gusts of warm breeze blowing down from the Western Hills swept through all parts of the garden, making people feel particularly comfortable and happy. That's right, this is her old home: and her retired resting place. In her twilight years, thanks to such a good place for her to enjoy herself, otherwise, the days she spent would have had no joy! What was most beneficial to her was that the garden was filled with three unique sights all year round: one was splendor, the second was tranquility, and the third was contentment. If she could see through everything and return all the power to Guangxu as before, her life would always have these three pleasant scenes: unfortunately, she could not, so she had to come to the garden on days when her political affairs were relatively leisurely to experience a moment of temporary tranquility and contentment. But when it came to splendor, it was all occupied by her: originally, what would be placed before the Empress Dowager's eyes would not be splendid? (266)</p>
<p>Local Customs</p>
<h3>A Japanese Spectacle—Naked Shrine Festival</h3>
<p>The "Naked Shrine Festival" is considered a wonder of the world by the Japanese. Examining its origins, it seems very similar to the "Beating Ghosts" custom in our country's Mongolian and Manchu customs, so it may have been passed down from ancient times in our country.</p>
<p>"Chasing away evil spirits" is the same as our country's "Beating Ghosts." It used to be a ritual performed in the Japanese court. "Da Nuo" refers to a big ghost, wearing a golden mask with four eyes on its head, dressed in black robes and a red skirt, holding a shield in its left hand and a dagger in its right. During the ceremony, after the Yin-Yang officials read the sacrificial text, they uttered the cries of small ghosts everywhere. Then the big ghost used the shield and dagger to drive the small ghosts out of the palace, praying for national peace and the happiness of the people. In spirit, after the evil ghosts are driven away, everyone's sins can be relieved.</p>
<p>This ritual has been passed down from ancient times to the present for over a thousand years. Now, shrines in various places have abolished it, but only the Guofu Yan Shrine still retains the ancient style. However, the rituals performed now are different from the form of "Chasing away evil spirits" in the palace in the past. The "Naked Festival" is held for a week, with the most grand event on the thirteenth day of the lunar new year. Society widely publicizes that in the past, the Japanese paid great attention to the Naked Festival. They all wore formal attire, fasted, bathed, and came from all directions to participate, hoping to eliminate their sins. Later, it gradually became casual, and the ceremony became very chaotic on the day of the festival. In the Tenmei period, the custom of nudity was a solemn divine affair. According to current regulations, men related to the evil spirits must strip naked and "rub shoulders" before they can eliminate their sins and prolong their lives.</p>
<p>According to old Japanese customs, the ages of twenty-five and forty-three are the years of misfortune. On the second day of the lunar new year, one must report to the shrine and select a "Year Man" by drawing lots. For the seven days before the "Inner Festival," one must stay in the Ghost Beating Hall for a fast. On the twelfth day of the lunar new year, the Shinto priests make a very large round New Year's cake with two or three liters of powder to worship the gods. On the morning of the thirteenth day, hundreds of naked men gather in the ritual field. At three o'clock in the afternoon, the Naked Festival begins. Everyone must go to the Ghost Beating Hall and rub the shoulders of the "Year Man" with their shoulders, and then rub each other's shoulders while circling in the hall. In this way, the skin heats up, and the water vapor rises, like a mist. More than ten thousand people come from near and far to watch the ceremony, and the fun is indescribable.</p>
<p>On the fourteenth day, the "Year Man" carries the large New Year's cake to the soil hill of "Little Mount Fuji" and digs a small hole to bury it. After chanting Buddhist scriptures for a few more days, the "Naked Festival" comes to an end. There is also a "Naked Festival" at the Kannon Hall of Saidaiji Temple in Bizen. More than one hundred thousand people come from the Keihan, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions. The rituals are slightly different and are held at 8 p.m. on the fourteenth day. Furthermore, at 2 a.m., the monks of Saidaiji Temple throw two wooden treasures from the window. The one who picks them up is called the "Lucky Man," and a group of naked men scramble for them.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Emperor Unemployment Insurance</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Since the King of Siam failed in his power struggle with the parliament, he immediately announced his abdication and lived a "Siam Overseas Chinese" life in London. After his nephew Ananda succeeded to the throne, the general public and officials did not have the same "loyal heart" as our "social" doctors when they saw Puyi, so we have not heard any talk about giving the King of Siam, who used to be rich in the entire country, an annual salary of 5 million yuan to show the benevolence of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Therefore, the King of Siam, who once called himself an orphan and was rich throughout the country, is now alone in a foreign land, taking refuge in another country, which makes people think of "the unbearable memories of the old country."</p>
<p>However, this imagination is an overestimation. Perhaps he cannot sell "antiques" such as precious pearls and dragon-eye pearls like the Manchu Qing imperial family, but the 20th century can make him smarter. After "retirement," he can receive 40,000 US dollars a year in unemployment insurance. Because a Paris dispatch said: The King of Siam, aware of the many kings of various countries who have lost their thrones, took out unemployment insurance for one million US dollars from British and French insurance companies a few years ago. When Ananda succeeded to the throne, he had already received compensation from the insurance company. In the future, he will receive a net of 40,000 US dollars per year until the end of his days.</p>
<p>When a person becomes a king and is the only one to be respected, he will naturally develop a psychology of "I am the country." In addition, in a situation where "all the land under the heavens is the king's land, and all the people on the land are the king's subjects," indeed no one wants to "be a king for all generations." Enjoying endless glory and wealth, wearing endless brocade and silk, and eating endless jade rice and golden waves, how could there be such a person who would willingly give up the "unified country" to others so easily? If you want to give it, unless you kill yourself. Therefore, it is rare and not easy for an emperor to become "unemployed."</p>
<h3>Tea Market</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>"Small tea leaves... She Du... Bridge above... Come..." The old man's voice echoed through the tea merchants' row; outside the doors of Wan Yuan and Xiang Tai, several mountain goods shops, were already posted signs saying, "Morning and evening prices differ; a single price is set now." Villagers rushing to the early market passed the shop entrances, their hearts feeling much lighter than usual; so, they gathered around, some asking the shop owners about tea prices, some standing by watching the signs. Seeing the notice, "This shop's small tea leaves will be weighed and priced starting tomorrow," they swallowed, temporarily suppressing the hunger in their bellies, and a gleam of hope gradually appeared in their once lifeless eyes.</p>
<p>In the town of Xia Gang, the boats collecting "Qing Tou" (tender tea leaves) from Dongshan were crowded together, one after another. Several of the plump faces of the mountain goods shop owners revealed a hint of smug smiles. Wan Yuan Shan, especially, swaying his large head, his tiny eyes almost squinting into slits, grinned and chatted with the "Pai Yuan" households at the shop entrance:</p>
<p>"Hey! This spring is cold, the yield will probably be small!"</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? The tea trees only have sprouts now; you might need glasses to find a few tea leaves!" Crab Claw Four chimed in.</p>
<p>"But now people are waiting for money, have nothing to eat, even the finest ones will be picked; as long as the shops weigh..." Crooked Head Jin Bin said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"That's right! Crab Claw Four, you should pay attention to the tea-making this year, don't let it be like last year, either too damp or so dry it turns to powder."</p>
<p>"Yes, boss! This year I'll have to fire the wok myself; women's hands are delicate and afraid of pain, so it won't do in the end; but will the market be better this year?" Crab Claw Four originally came to inquire about prices.</p>
<p>"That's hard to say; you see, even after Qingming Festival, not many tea merchants have come." Wan Yuan Shan stroked his short, eight-shaped mustache and replied with experience.</p>
<p>"Probably two jiao entering customs is unlikely, last year it was more than two jiao per tael! At the beginning, I even sold it for three jiao per tael."</p>
<p>Crab Claw Four left the shop entrance, looked around at the teahouses and taverns, and saw that everyone had left, even Crooked Head Jin Bin and Hanged Silver Dragon had gone home to eat. So, he hung his damp pipe on his arm and walked home.</p>
<p>He thought, even if he sold cheaply last year, he still got two jiao. If this year doesn't reach last year's price, then the villagers might have to eat river water. In the past, one season of tea leaves was a small income, and the silkworm raising capital had to follow its lead; silkworm raising was the big hope, the living expenses from May to August all depended on it, "A desolate spring, three bitter months, eight months of hardship," if there weren't these two seasons of income, how would the villagers get by? But now, silkworm raising is already a difficult topic, so this season's small income is our only life-saving Bodhisattva. However, in recent years, the tea trade with foreign firms is not smooth; the Japanese, the Russians, they also know how to grow tea; it's really possible that this bowl of rice will be taken away in the future!</p>
<p>Crab Claw Four walked and thought, and when he got home, he saw that the door was locked, knowing that his wife had already eaten and gone to the mountain to pick tea leaves; a key was hidden in a wall hole, a secret known only to him and her, no one else knew. He opened the wok lid, saw that it was soybean porridge for dinner, and without a choice ate two large bowls, then went to the mountain to pick tea leaves with his wife.</p>
<p>This year, the spring started late, so the tea leaves sprouted late too. The sprouts on the tea trees were really only the size of rice grains now; it took effort to pick an ounce of "Qing Tou," and one ounce of dried tea leaves required three ounces of "Qing Tou." The two of them picked from morning till dark, barely managing to gather a wokful, weighing less than four ounces of dried tea leaves.</p>
<p>The next morning, Crab Claw Four took a small package of tea leaves to the tea market. He saw that there were many people, but they were all small farm households; there weren't even half a jin households. The entrance to Xiang Tai shop was also packed, making the street much livelier than usual.</p>
<p>He walked into Wan Yuan shop, only to see Wan Yuan Shan was so busy that he could barely breathe while weighing tea leaves.</p>
<p>"These tea leaves are too dark; they're only worth one and a half jiao per tael!"</p>
<p>"Ah! The fire was too strong; it's already burnt. Two taels and four qian, three and a half jiao."</p>
<p>"Eh! There are too many white leaves here; four and a half taels, deduct five qian for the wrapping paper, five jiao big money."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>He watched them weigh one package after another; they either said it was too damp or too dry, there were hardly any good ones. He didn't seem to hear the sound of "Shop owner, add some!" as he opened one package and went to weigh the second: "Sell it if you want, don't sell it if you don't!"</p>
<p>"Is the price really much worse than last year?" Crab Claw Four was a bit doubtful. "It can't be!"</p>

<h3>Square and Circle</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>In this ancient country of ours on the continent of East Asia, we have always been considered the "sick man." The acquisition of this fine name is naturally not a recent event, and naturally it has its considerable factors. Although now, thanks to the urgent calls of those who care, there has been some progress overall, enough to attract a little attention, but after all, because its latent power is too great, wanting to save this established reputation is by no means something that can be done in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>Recently, the tuberculosis test of elementary school students in this city, when the results met with us, could not help but generate a kind of emotion. Although only five schools participated, but judging from the statistics, those infected with lung disease actually account for more than 70 percent. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>Children are sprouting seedlings. If they are not properly cultivated when they are "sprouting," then their growth is bound to be very dangerous, and maybe even die halfway.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that in addition to "self-healing," in addition to parents needing to pay close attention, the establishment of children's sanatoriums is indeed essential!</p>
<p>"In recent years, the social economy has been very sluggish," this statement can always be heard often, whether in the newspapers or on people's lips. And after hearing it, what then? Some are "silent," some "respond with a faint smile," and some are "filled with emotion." Although these things don't have any practical effect, what else can you expect them to do?</p>
<p>People in the "social circle" cried, jumped, and even wept in this atmosphere, but people outside the circle are still laughing, comfort has blinded their hearts, as if that sharp circle will never be related to them. However, infants who don't understand human affairs, although they have no part in either circle, cannot escape the net of this circle, and must endure the refinement of the atmosphere. For this, they can only hate being born in a bad year, there is nothing else to say.</p>
<p>Thus, infants who have just left the womb are painfully sent to "infant asylums," painfully allowed to be "adopted" by others, painfully separated from the affection of both sides.</p>
<p>In the modern era where males dominate the center of society, the concept of "valuing men" is always unavoidable in the eyes of the general public. Thus, in the past, infants in infant asylums could often be taken away in a dozen days, but now? Because of the high tide of the atmosphere, it has reached the point of "no one caring" and feeling "overcrowding." Here, one cannot help but let out a long sigh and think to oneself: "In recent years, the social economy has been very sluggish."</p>
<h3>Random Notes of a Wanderer</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>Around noon, the boat stopped at the small ferry of Sandao Kou. The boatman tied the rope, and the passengers inside the cabin began to stir: men carrying packages and baskets, women leading children, like a string of fish, walked to the bow of the boat, to the gangplank, to the shore, to the dry little road—there, perhaps there was a nest-like old home, perhaps there was warm friendship, perhaps a fire-like irresistible love was burning... Thus, a string of people, people living under different circumstances—there were retired old soldiers, middle-aged men wandering the world selling skills under the banner of "making friends through martial arts," men working as servants in big mansions in Shanghai, people ringing bells and setting up stalls on the street "reading faces," and wanderers who had forgotten the term "home"—went to different roads with different purposes.</p>
<p>The boatman lay down on the deck at the bow of the boat, which was covered with bright sunshine. He counted the collected boat money, bundling two strings of cash together; but after working hard rowing for a trip, he only made about twenty strings, and everything is not thriving this year, it's really hard for those who work hard to make ends meet to get enough to eat.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, he sighed; a kind of fear, like a misty fog, shifted in the wrinkles on his forehead beyond five thousand. —Ah, what kind of days are these?</p>
<p>Sitting up, he packed a pipe with damp tobacco and smoked, the shore was quiet, and there weren't many ripples in the water. The thoughts of a young man bloomed like rapeseed flowers, carrying a golden posture, opening up in the garden of memory. At that time, there was no suffering, no worry, life itself was as quiet as the spring pool, the summer night, and the autumn wheat ears.</p>
<p>It has already been a very, very long time.</p>
<p>Father was a dark, strong man, but he was also very honest, unable to argue with people in more than three sentences, the veins on his face would all swell up in anxiety, but people didn't dare to argue with him; he didn't have an amazing mouth, but he did have strong fists. Taking the woman, using the boat as a home, he ventured out from one wharf to another.</p>
<p>I love the water, I love the sea—I like to watch the ferocious waves in the sea, and the sun, like a fire plate, floating at the end of the horizon. Was I born and raised as a wanderer in the water town?</p>
<p>So, I grew up. But I also don't lack the body of a strong young man. Helping the guys row the scull, not even uttering a word of fatigue for most of the day.</p>
<p>The old man praised as he looked me over with my dark big eyes, saying: Good fellow, you really grew up in the water town, a seed of wandering. So he used the old sailor's wildness, patting my broad shoulders: "Hey, I say, young man, you should find a pretty young lady to be your companion."</p>
<p>The older generation gradually weakened, fell down, and along with the youth of the old men, these peaceful days will also pass forever and will never come again. When I used my powerful arms to take over the boat (the wandering, drifting home) from the old man's hands, the old era had already shed a layer of its shell; and the new wandering also began at this moment.</p>
<p>Thus: one oar after another, one port after another, one river after another, one year after another, when the labor of people has become a commodity in the auction market, it has unknowingly drifted by day after day.</p>
<p>—The water town is our birthplace, the water town is our grave, we are innate wanderers.</p>
<p>It was noon, the crew brought out the meal, and in the hot rice fragrance, someone on the shore shouted:</p>
<p>—Hey, the boat is coming!</p>
<p>I hurriedly put on a smiling face to greet them, thinking: I don't know where the dream of tomorrow midnight will be lost.</p>

<h3>Spring Arrives in the World</h3>
<p>— Mian Huai (Cherishing Memories)</p>
<p>Spring has finally adorned this gray world.</p>
<p>The window of the writing room faces south. With tired eyes, as if from a hangover, I squander the bright spring sunshine in Arabic numerals. Although the sunlight, like a mother's love, caresses my desk very early, it makes me feel even more weary of life. Spring is a season of vigor: grass and trees return to life, hibernating insects wriggle, and the flags waving in the light breeze, advertising big sales, also hide the rampant tide of recession around the world. Even the most unambitious humans raise the creed that "the plan of the year lies in spring," as if trying hard to do more things. But this separation of a layer of glass window, in my view, is as far away as another planet!</p>
<p>Young people shouldn't have such thoughts! That loud voice thundered in my ears. Really? In such doubt, I made a phone call to my friend. I said: "It's spring, come to my house on Sunday. Let's play some tricks from our student days. Anything is fine. We must spend this day in the most satisfying way."</p>
<p>On the expecting morning, I got up early, wiped the windows, and swept the floor. When I saw the sun gently slipping into the well, I cheered. It wasn't she who adorned this gray world, it was the world's natural light.</p>
<p>I took the newspaper delivered that day and sat alone in the small patio, facing east, flipping through the supplement as if fighting for it in the reading room. The pieces of advertisements were all jumping, every lead character had changed to "Spring has arrived!" So I threw the newspaper into the corner of the wall, mindful that my friend hadn't changed his habit of sleeping late from school days. I calculated how to send this sun to the west mountain in a satisfying way. Watching the clock, it was still early. I knew that waiting for the arrival of a happy day should deliberately do some things that one doesn't want to do, so that when it suddenly arrives, it will be a hundred times more interesting.</p>
<p>So I returned to the bedroom to tidy up my desk, newspapers, magazines, almond extract, aspirin, arranging them in the most orderly way. I wiped the dust off the photo frame, and when I was whistling unconsciously, my friend pushed the door in. But unexpectedly, I didn't feel a hundred times more interesting. He took off his long coat, sat down, and hurriedly started smoking.</p>
<p>After a long while, he said that he was called to the company to do some things that shouldn't have been done today. Remembering your appointment, I wanted to finish it hastily but was supervised by foreigners. He ended the following words with a sigh.</p>
<p>This small blow hasn't completely suppressed our enthusiasm. After lunch, we discussed a list of how to spend the day. We always felt that the tricks we played in our student days seemed too boring now. And the interesting things? No one had that idea hidden in their heads?</p>
<p>We sent the sun back to the west mountain without leaving the bedroom a step. I remember we talked about many old classmates, someone left home and traveled far away, someone lost their job, someone's marriage was unhappy... And strangely, our lives are exactly what so-and-so wants the most. I looked out the window, and the sun outside that layer of glass gradually left my sight.</p>

<p>On the Use of Troops</p>
<p>Huaxing (1260) 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM</p>
<p>The gentleman uses troops with sincerity. There is nowhere sincerity is not used. The world has not yet seen sincerity and lightness. Though the enemy seeks to entice him, how can he be enticed? The world has not yet seen sincerity and greed. Though the enemy seeks to bait him, how can he be baited? The world has not yet seen sincerity and disorder. Though the enemy seeks to confuse him, how can he be confused? Using this sincerity to comfort and govern, the masses will not doubt. It cannot be confused by counter-questioning. Using this sincerity to prepare and defend, the masses will not be idle. It cannot be misled by cunning schemes. That which they used to gain victory, was because of lightness. Once sincerity is established, the five vices are all eliminated. Even if the ancient experts of war encircled and attacked, exhausting their cunning plans a hundred or a thousand times, the gentleman treats them with sincerity alone. Their cunning is exhausted by ten thousand but not enough, my sincerity guards one and is more than enough. They are always labored and I am always at ease. They are always moving and I am always still. Using ease to control labor, using stillness to control movement, is this not the way to constant victory in the world? Therefore, those who discuss the excellence of using troops in the world, are surely none other than the gentleman.</p>

<h3>New Developments in 1935 Model Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin</p>
<p>This article is from the 72nd volume, 2nd issue of "Automobile Industry." It was written by an American automotive engineering expert, P.M. Heldt. It thoroughly elaborates on the areas of improvement in new cars. Therefore, I translated it as follows:</p>
<p>Those who have visited the New York Auto Show generally believe that there have been significant changes in automobile design in the past year. In reality, these changes are only on the surface. Everything inside, under the hood, and under the car body is pretty much the same as last year. Except for one thing: the redistribution of weight to increase driving stability. However, there are also many minor improvements.</p>
<p>In the past, the greatest efforts of the engineering department were spent on sheet metal work to increase sales demand. As a result, "streamlining" has become almost a buzzword. The most important and most common reform is to hide the spare tire in the rear of the car body. This allows the car body to gradually approach a true streamlined shape. Fender skirts and rear panels have also been greatly improved in form compared to previous tilted fenders and other protruding parts, minimizing their air resistance.</p>
<p>Almost many automobile designers believe that if the shape of a car is truly close to a theoretical streamlined shape, then the car body will be ridiculed for having a large nose. This is naturally not welcome by customers. Therefore, they came up with a method to streamline each part of the car separately, making their shape the most suitable and most attractive. The merging of the radiator grille and the hood must also match the fenders. Then, connect the parts and use sheet metal fairings to create the streamlined shape of an airplane wing.</p>
<p>Here, whether it is people in the automobile industry or the general public who use automobiles, they cannot help but be extremely curious about the independent front suspension. They don't know how American automakers will implement this independent front suspension system after their first year of testing. If an automobile manufacturer has a standard for the manufacturing program of the next year, then he will definitely be able to make his test satisfactory. Several manufacturers who adopted this system last year have generally not changed it this year. In addition, two new manufacturers have also adopted this system. At the same time, some manufacturers do not use this system, perhaps because of its higher price.</p>
<p>Everyone also knows that independent front suspension is indeed more expensive to manufacture when installed on American cars. Buyers generally have a deep impression that there are two different types of cars on the market now. Their prices are different. The more expensive ones are equipped with independent front suspension, while others are not.</p>
<p>Before the independent front suspension was fully developed, another change began last year to improve driving comfort. This is the movement of the engine part forward and the increase of the front suspension's range of motion. In the past, the radiator was always placed above the front axle. The engine was further back so that its position could be lowered without interfering with the front axle. This year, the engine is mostly moved forward between six and eight inches. This not only reduces shock and noise, but also allows the seats in the car to move forward at the same time, away from the rear axle, so that passengers are not subjected to the vibration transmitted from the rear wheels. This also makes it easier to streamline the rear of the car body. At the same time, it can hide the spare tire in the back of the car body.</p>
<p>The engines are also more powerful than last year's. This is due to the increased intake volume and compression ratio, not relying on increasing the displacement of the pistons. We can try to make the compression ratio higher and higher every day, but still not make the engine prone to knocking. The cylinder heads made of cast iron can have a compression ratio of up to 6.5 or even 6.7. However, since we adopted aluminum, it has been found in recent years that its ratio is too large. Although recent improvements in combustion chambers can also increase horsepower, there probably won't be rapid development without improvements in the anti-knock properties of fuel. As for installing a heat regulator in the intake manifold to adjust the heat, it also helps to increase horsepower.</p>
<p>In addition, the timing of the spark is a big problem in increasing the compression ratio. In places with a very high ratio, we probably use the vacuum in the intake manifold to control the spark. When the engine is running slowly due to heavy load, the spark is very delayed, preventing all the effects of high pressure, such as explosions.</p>
<p>The average standard compression ratio used in passenger cars last year was from 5.72 to 5.94.</p>
<p>Because we want to increase the compression ratio, the volume of the compression chamber has to be reduced, and difficulties arise with the clearance next to the valves, especially for L-head engines. In the past year, a lot of research has been spent on this to give the compression chamber a suitable shape that does not hinder the flow of gas. We already know that at high altitudes, exhaust is easier to solve than intake, and exhaust valves can be made smaller than intake valves. For the same reason, the clearance next to the exhaust valve can also be less than the intake valve. Using this theory when designing the combustion chamber, the intake volume of the intake system can be increased, and the volumetric efficiency of the engine can also be improved at high speeds. Not only that, increasing the ratio of the exhaust valve area to the volume can make exhaust gas easier to cool and avoid the tendency to explode.</p>
<p>The gradual increase in horsepower has made the cylinder need a very effective cooling system, especially at the exhaust valve seat. There are currently two methods. One method is to install a water distributor in the water jacket to spray water onto the wall of the exhaust valve. The other method is to extend the water jacket to the crankcase. The former benefits can reduce the temperature of the exhaust valve seat, reduce the damage to the valve seat, and prevent the valve from gradually sinking. The latter benefit can reduce the temperature of the oil in the crankcase, protecting its vulnerable parts from damage even under extremely severe working conditions.</p>
<p>The bearing load also increases with the increase in speed. Therefore, sometimes the safety factors used seem to be no longer applicable. Therefore, the crankshaft has more complete weight balancing in many places to reduce the load on the main bearings. The most heavily loaded bearing in the engine—apart from the piston pin, because the friction damage inside is not great—can be considered the crankshaft pin bearing. Now, two types of passenger cars use a bronze with a very high lead content to make this bearing. There is also a type of car that uses an alloy of cadmium, silver, and copper to make the bearing. This alloy has properties similar to leaded bronze, has a very high melting point, and does not lose its strength at high temperatures.</p>
<p>Aluminum cylinders are used more widely, although one manufacturer has abandoned this method due to cost considerations. In addition, in the past five years, automotive mechanical equipment has been able to produce more improvements in driving comfort, convenience, and economy. Manufacturers have determined that standard equipment. It is very obvious that in the past seven years, even in extremely difficult times, manufacturers have been actively seeking to improve equipment in order to facilitate sales. But this year, the situation is different. Many manufacturers have abandoned some of the equipment that was considered standard last year. The reason is the increase in manufacturing costs and the reduction in external purchasing power.</p>
<p>There have not been major changes to carburetor equipment. Down-draft carburetors are now almost the equipment adopted worldwide. Air filters and intake silencers are also widely used. Dual carburetors are now used on many eight-cylinder engines, whether V-shaped or inline. Many manufacturers now also move the spark coil to the engine. This can reduce the length of the high-voltage wires, radio isolation can be easier, and it is also beneficial for ignition.</p>
<p>Everyone has also paid considerable attention to the engine's lubrication system. On at least two types of engines, the gauge port has been adopted on the crankshaft. The advantage is that the oil delivery rate is not affected by the bearing clearance. Therefore, it has nothing to do with the gradual wear of the parts. Our pure experience tells us that after a car has traveled a certain mileage, it is often difficult for the lubricating oil to maintain a sufficient pressure. But this difficulty has now been solved by the gauge port. In addition, there is a new development: the use of larger oil pumps and oil passages. The disadvantage is that it makes it difficult for the lubricating oil to supply the normal amount of oil when the car is just started. The Packard car has a removable oil filter that can change the oil pressure to automatically clean the oil filter's intermediate products. The Chevrolet car adds an oil injector to lubricate the crankshaft pin bearings. The lubricating oil is injected into the connecting rod holes, and the pressure varies with the driving speed.</p>
<p>The capacity of the generator has also increased. But its size has not increased. The weight does not increase either. We only need to add a fan. At the same time, increase its speed within the possible range. The generator on the Packard car can supply 30 amps of current. But this also has a disadvantage: it is easy to overcharge the battery and cause damage. Therefore, the new model also has a protective relay.</p>
<p>Many problems occur with the gearbox. The reason is that the horsepower of the primary engine gradually increases, but the size of the gearbox does not change. Secondly, in recent years, we have strived for convenience in management, and there have been many changes. There are two ways to deal with these problems. (1) Increase the mechanical advantages of the gearbox. This is to increase the stroke of the gearbox pedal, which seems uneconomical. (2) Reduce the pressure on the gearbox plate. Therefore, the spare capacity is reduced. However, this will inevitably cause the gearbox to slip, causing heat and wear. To avoid this difficulty, we now use ventilation methods. Its vents have air filter screens to prevent dust from entering.</p>
<p>There is also a new type of semi-centrifugal gearbox. It is equipped with one or a row of springs, using its lighter pressure to transmit the machine's maximum torque.</p>
<p>Finally. Speaking of braking systems, hydraulic brakes are very fashionable. In the past, the emergency brake on the propeller shaft was always connected to the hydraulic brake, but now that we use the brake lever, we can save an emergency brake. In addition, there is a vacuum power brake adopted by Heber. However, Chrysler has abandoned this type of braking system.</p>
<h3>Another Victory for the Austin</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The New Oakland Highway in New Zealand was recently completed. The highest official from that area personally attended the opening ceremony. Automobile races were also held on the same day. As a result, a single-seat, 7-horsepower Austin performed exceptionally well, winning the championship. At that time, thousands of spectators were amazed and envious, praising it endlessly.</p>
<p>The Austin Seven later ranked first in the public obstacle race. It is said that the participants in this competition were all famous racing cars. As for the 1,500 cc class, the Austin also won the runner-up. The person who drove the Austin to achieve the above victories was Mr. Smith. It is also said that the first and second places in the first hill-climbing race held in Xuelong were also won by the Austin.</p>
<h3>Review of Road Safety Issues</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>(1) Progress in Safety</p>
<p>Currently, the most serious problem regarding automobiles is to reduce the number of accidents on the roads. Perhaps no one would deny this. Therefore, people who use the roads should be responsible for solving this problem, so that the number of accidents can be effectively reduced. Before we notice that the number of cars traveling on the roads is increasing day by day, although we will know that automobile accidents are only increasing and decreasing according to weekly and monthly investigation records. However, automobile manufacturing is currently more advanced in terms of safety than in the past, even than a few years ago. No one would deny this. According to various records in the United Kingdom, the number of cars traveling on the roads has generally increased by 9.4% in the past three years. However, the number of people killed or injured in accidents has only increased by 1%. If this method of comparison is based on the mileage traveled by automobiles and the consumption of gasoline, then we can know from the gasoline consumed by automobiles that the number of people killed by automobiles has fallen from 8.71% to 6.67% per million gallons in the past decade.</p>
<p>(2) Road Safety</p>
<p>How exactly does this method of comparison prove the improvement of road safety? It is to combine all the mileage traveled by automobiles and make a statistics with all the automobile injury cases. Then we can get an answer: it is assumed that a car travels 3,000,000 miles per year and will only kill one pedestrian after 430 years of driving. And this statistic is actually estimated to be a bit high. In addition, there is one more thing we should know: the past statistics of automobile homicides did not pay attention to other aspects of influence. However, it has recently been discovered in the United Kingdom that cold easterly winds make it inconvenient for cars to travel. In the same week, the homicide record increased by half compared to normal. The United Kingdom has also proven that deaths caused by poor roads only account for 1.5% of automobile homicide cases. People who are working hard to improve road construction also want to completely eliminate this 1.5% record. The only reason why road safety has improved is that people who use the roads are generally able to take responsibility for prevention and driving automobiles. Surgical treatment has made a lot of progress. And this improvement, traced back to its source, should be attributed to the progress of automobile manufacturing. Currently, the cars you purchase have a lower center of gravity, stronger cross-chassis bars, the effect of counterweight, all-steel body, safety glass, everything is enough to make the safety of passengers increase.</p>

<p>(3) Engine Safety</p>
<p>Further speaking, the smoothness of the engine, the use of gears, because of harmonic motion, simple and rapid, the clear indication of stopping or turning, the easy control of headlights, make the control of modern cars by drivers much more convenient than cars a few years ago. Therefore, when driving, drivers do not have to pay too much attention to the handling of the machine, and can concentrate their vision on the road in front of the car and care about safety issues. If we can remember the above advantages, then we can know that the automobile is a very safe type of modern transportation. At the same time. We must not forget that the current driving of automobiles has achieved good results. Everything that was impossible before is now possible. Test drives, anti-skid, and various other cost-consuming and scientific devices are enough to make your car safer and increase its driving value. The increasing development of automobiles. Undoubtedly, any people who drive automobiles should be extra careful to prevent accidents easily due to the increase of vehicles traveling on the road. At the same time. Drivers should also urge automobile manufacturers to strive for perfection in manufacturing to eliminate the ingredients that cause accidents. In this way, the safety level of automobiles will inevitably be improved. The safety and comfort of road travel is a limitless gift. In this era. We know that we are much more advanced than before. But from now on, we should take on more responsibility to make it even more perfect. And to achieve this goal. The most important point. Of course, it lies in reducing the number of accidents. This is something that every traveler should be responsible for promoting.</p>
<h3>Daily Inspection and Protection Methods for Automobile Storage Batteries</h3>
<p>— Zhen Min</p>
<p>Storage batteries only occupy the position of two kinds of accessories on the entire car. General car owners and drivers often do not pay attention to them. This is really a big mistake. You must know that this small storage battery is actually the central hub for controlling the life of the entire car. The explosion of the engine. The light of the headlights at night. The sound of the horn. Everything depends on the power output of this small storage battery. If the storage battery fails. Then your engine has a very large supply of gasoline. But it will not achieve the purpose of driving. Therefore. When applying storage batteries. We should always inspect and protect them at the specified time. So that it does not produce any obstacles. This is really the responsibility of every driver. Now let's briefly describe the most important points.</p>
<p>(1) Measure Voltage—After the storage battery has been outputting electricity for a long time (about three weeks or more). Its voltage will slowly decrease. At the same time, the current will also become smaller. At this time, you should use a voltmeter (ie, a voltmeter) to measure its short-circuit voltage. (Use the two ends of the meter to really contact the positive and negative electrodes. The time should be short). The voltage after power output should not be less than 1.75 volts. (This refers to ordinary storage batteries used in general cars). Once this limit is reached. You should charge it immediately. Otherwise, sulfuric acid crystals will adhere to the electrode plates. As a result, the entire battery loses its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(2) Injection of Electrolyte—The storage battery causes the electrolyte to gradually evaporate as a result of continuous power output and charging. The ingredients contained in the electrolyte are sulfuric acid and distilled water. Among them, the capacity of sulfuric acid will not decrease. We only allow the addition of distilled water at any time. Make sure that the horizontal line at the top of the electrode plate is completely immersed in the electrolyte.</p>
<p>(3) Precautions for Charging—When the voltage drops to 1.75 volts after power output. You should charge it immediately. But you must pay attention to the following points when charging:</p>
<p>(A) The charging time. Must be at least five hours.</p>
<p>(B) When charging, gas is discharged around the electrodes. This gas is rich in flammability. Do not approach it with fire. To avoid explosion.</p>
<p>(C) Avoid overcharging. Because overcharging can accelerate the evaporation of the electrolyte. At the same time, the metal debris on the electrodes sinks to the bottom of the pool. It is easy to cause a short circuit.</p>
<p>(D) Once the storage battery is weakly powered. You should charge it immediately. Do not leave it for a three-month deadline. (Otherwise, solid sulfuric acid crystals will grow on the electrodes. Destroying the entire battery.</p>
<p>(4) Regulations on Electrolyte Specific Gravity—The specific gravity of the electrolyte. Should have regulations. The highest specific gravity of the electrolyte after charging. Must not exceed 1.300. The low specific gravity after power output. Must not be lower than 1.150. This specific gravity test. A hydrometer can be inserted into the electrolyte to measure it by automatically raising and lowering it.</p>
<p>(5) Precautions for Cleaning Electrolyte—If you want to remove sediment or precipitates from the bottom of the pool. The first step. First, fully charge this storage battery. Then take out the electrode plates. Use distilled water to carefully rinse the electrodes and the surrounding area of the pool. The electrodes should be placed back in their original place when they are not dry. Some storage batteries are equipped with specially made cleaning systems. There is no need to disassemble accessories.</p>
<p>(6) If rust or other phenomena are found on the electrode plate. You should replace it with a new board. To maintain a constant voltage. This replacement of electrode plates. Can be configured to nearby electrical materials.</p>
<p>(7) The two ends of the electrodes should always maintain a conductive state. Apply less Vaseline. To prevent rust.</p>
<p>(8) The vent at the top of the battery. Should always be kept open. Do not allow it to be blocked.</p>
<p>The above are the most important methods of protecting storage batteries. Every driver should always pay attention to them. The batteries used on general cars now. They are all lead-acid storage batteries. Its price is cheaper than Edison storage batteries. However, lead plates are prone to rust and other phenomena. This point must be checked at all times. In order to replace it.</p>
<p>New-style cars now. They all use an electrical machine and battery connection system. After the storage battery is over-powered. It is automatically charged by the generator at any time. The simplicity and speed of this cyclical system. Truly a merit. But sometimes this charging capacity is too weak. We have to use other charging methods.</p>
<h3>Austin Adds New Factory</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Using Electric Keys to Assemble Car Bodies</p>
<p>The Austin Motor Company has recently added a new factory to its Longbridge plant. Using the latest type of conveying machinery. Engaged in assembly work. Its agility and skill are truly amazing. The new factory is worth £20,000. The floor area is 41,000 square feet. It is specially used for car body assembly and its subsidiary work. All Austin car body and chassis combinations. They are all made here. It is estimated that each successful combination only takes one and a half minutes. That is, about 2,000 combinations can be made per week.</p>
<p>This work. Now it is handled by electric keys. Its simplicity is unique. A row of electric keys. Placed on the management platform. The administrator sits in front of the electric keys. In order to preside over the operation of three car body cranes. Each car body. It is lifted from the platform by one of the three cranes. After turning and dispatching. After adjusting its position. Slowly placed on top of the chassis. It fits perfectly. Not a millimeter off. The accuracy of its coordination. Truly has the magic of nature. As for the matched chassis. It is also newly transported from the shipping point. Wait for the car body to be assembled in seconds. The car has been assembled. Waiting to be subjected to the final steps. Then it is moved away by the conveying rope. This automobile conveying rope. It is a total of six. Each is 100 yards long. Two of them. There are also high-rise parts. Allowing mechanics to work under passing cars. As for the various parts required for the conveying rope. And various necessary equipment. It is supplied by three mezzanine supply points. And the three supply points. A conveyor with a length of about 600 yards is used. Get supplies from the main supply point. Therefore, in the entire factory. No matter when and where. All component parts needed for the transport machine. All are automatically supplied. Furthermore, at the end of each conveying rope. Equipped with electric gasoline pumps. Quickly provide fuel to the Austin. Therefore, each car can be driven with its own power after being assembled. In order to test it.</p>
<h3>Overview of the New 1935 Oldsmobile</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The 1935 Oldsmobile six-cylinder and straight-eight-cylinder new cars have now been presented to the world. The new cars are even more spacious and grand than before. They not only possess all the mechanical engineering advancements of 1934, but also have several new important features. The first major improvement of the new car that should be mentioned is the Fisher body. The newly installed roof is pressed from a solid, seamless steel plate and is closely integrated with the body, as if it were a single part. Passengers inside the car are assured of robust and excellent steel for their safety, whether above, below, or in any other direction. As for the streamlined design, it makes the whole car graceful, magnificent, and extremely attractive. This is mainly due to the new radiator cap and the rear bumper, which can thoroughly achieve streamlining.</p>
<p>The new car adopts an X-type frame, whose strength and solidity have increased by 40% compared to previous models. The chassis, engine, and body all use sound-absorbing and perfect organization. The interior of the car is spacious, with greatly increased head and leg room. The seats are wider and the padding is excellent. The spacious luggage compartment and the redistribution of the entire car's weight mean that all passengers are now positioned between the axles, making them feel particularly comfortable. This advantage is due to the fact that the motor and seats of the new car are positioned about five inches further forward than the 1934 model.</p>
<p>Whether it is the six-cylinder or eight-cylinder model, the new car has a longer wheelbase. The increase in its original power is mostly due to the use of a newly designed cylinder head, which has a higher compression ratio and can still use standard fuel. The intake manifold system and carburetor have been greatly improved, making their use more economical and cost-effective. According to actual road tests, the six-cylinder car achieves 18 miles per gallon at a speed of 50 miles per hour.</p>
<p>There are seven body styles available for both the six-cylinder and eight-cylinder models. The horsepower of the six-cylinder model is 84 to 90 horsepower, while the eight-cylinder model is 90 to 100 horsepower. The engine adopts a new three-point suspension method, and the operation is quieter than before. Therefore, whether in terms of efficiency, economy, comfort, aesthetics, or any other aspect, the new car has made great progress.</p>

<h3>A Psychological Analysis of Ruan Lingyu's Suicide</h3>
<p>— Bo Ning</p>
<p>Love affairs are not uncommon in the film industry. Hollywood sees dozens of scandals every year. Not to mention abroad, there have been quite a few scandalous stories on the domestic film scene that once caused a sensation. Why is it that those people can all live happily, while Ruan Lingyu insisted on quarreling with her own life, resolutely abandoning this world? This must not be accidental; part of it is naturally due to her social background. However, the reporter believes that her personal psychological conditions should be an important factor in her suicide.</p>
<p>Her emotional life... Everyone knows that emotions can determine a person's behavior. You can't ask a melancholy person to dance and prance. You can't ask a happy person to frown and look sad. But people only know that emotions can determine behavior, and they don't know that behavior can also determine emotions. An American psychologist once said, "People don't cry because they are sad, they are sad because they cried; people don't laugh because they are happy, they are happy because they laughed." The films starring Ruan Lingyu, such as "Reminiscences of the Old Capital," "Little Toys," "Life," "The Goddess," and the recent "New Woman," are all social tragedies. Movies are originally plays, and plays are originally just acting, but to make them realistic and moving, the actor must regard the play as part of their own life. This is where the emotional life of the actor is affected. That is, "sad because they cried." This kind of sad emotion in Ruan Lingyu was still latent in normal times and not easy to observe. Once she encountered something unsatisfactory, of course, it would erupt uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Terrible experiences... How do people deal with the environment? Part of it is also determined by past experiences. A Japanese wife, upon seeing her husband, bends down to take off his clogs; an American wife, upon seeing her husband, crosses her legs and asks him to take off her high heels. These are all determined by their past experiences. A Japanese wife would never cross her legs upon seeing her husband, and an American wife would never bend down upon seeing her husband. When Ruan Lingyu lived with Zhang Damin, she once took poison. This was her past experience. Therefore, now that she encountered difficulties, her past experience became active again. Coupled with sad emotions and "strong suggestion," she involuntarily embarked on the old path.</p>
<p>Strong suggestion... When I say a strong suggestion, what is a strong suggestion? Whenever a person has a "pre-existing state," encountering a certain stimulus becomes a strong suggestion. For example, the rickshaw pullers on the road have a "pre-existing state of customers calling for a rickshaw." Anyone who inadvertently raises their hand at the entrance of a theater, they will rush over pulling their rickshaw. Ruan Lingyu already had a past experience of suicide and was awakened by bad emotions and current difficulties. She already had a kind of "pre-existing state of suicide." It is said that when she returned home from the Yangtze Hotel, Ruan had seen two ghosts of impermanence before her death, which was an illusion. And because she has always believed in ghosts, she believed that she was probably "doomed to die" and single-mindedly embarked on the road to death. Alas! Such a promising movie star actually fell for her own psychology, and her life was tragically cut short. It is truly a human tragedy.</p>
<p>The question afterwards... Ruan Lingyu is dead. Apart from sighing, we cannot remedy it. However, she has left behind a serious psychological problem. We know that after Goethe's *The Sorrows of Young Werther* was published, countless young Germans died for love. Suicide also became fashionable in society. Werther is still a fictional character. Ruan Lingyu is a real artist and a figure loved and sympathized with by modern youth. Her death may give young people a "suggestion." Everyone, don't look down on the role of suggestion. Porf. J.M. Baldwin said: "Suggestion is psychological and social." Then we have a responsibility to prevent young men and women. The press, in particular, should pay more attention to this.</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Orawling Death [sic]"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Orawling Death—Paris Screening</p>
<p>Stories like "Tarzan the Ape Man" are almost a myth, but "Crawling Death," which has been translated as "Little Tarzan's Love Story," has a story that is closer to human emotions. After Bob's parents divorced, Bob's mother took him to the mountains and forests on the Mexican border. Ten years later, Bob's father came to find them, and the couple reconciled. These things are naturally more plausible.</p>
<p>But it is a pity that this plausible story was made fragmented and disjointed by a low-level screenwriter, even to the point of being incomprehensible. It simply does not become a story, and as a result, it is not known what should be expressed.</p>
<p>There are also some wild animals that appear here, but most of them are tame, such as snakes and crocodiles. When the characters in the play go to catch them, they are almost dead. One scene, in which a wild bull and a tiger fight, can be called the most exciting part of the film, but it is obvious that it was cut from other films. This can be seen from the sudden appearance of a black child at that time, because he is completely unrelated to the entire film.</p>
<p>This shows that the author of this film is purely profiting by ignoble methods, so there is also a group of young girls appearing nude. But even this point is not successful, because the audience in 1935 often comes into contact with a lot of films with sophisticated techniques, and naturally feels that there is nothing to recommend in this kind of work. Furthermore, how many animal films can arouse people's interest at present? Although it was a sensation for a time, it is now outdated, let alone a crudely made and vulgar work?</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>My Review of "Serpent Woman"</h3>
<p>— Chi Ying</p>
<p>This "Serpent Woman," renamed from "Vortex," is constructed with an extremely ordinary story. From all aspects, there is no miracle worth noting. It gives us some extremely bland images. Its story is based on the evil vortex of the city, which caused a tragic change in a family. So what it tells us is, "People who lack self-control, beware of the evil vortex of the city!"</p>
<p>However, the director neglected the realistic aspects: like Wang Guilin using oversensitive nerves to sigh about the future fate of her son because of the whirlpool of water; Zhang Yi living in a house enjoyed by the middle class with a salary of forty yuan; a socialite who abandons the old and welcomes the new actually falling in love with the proletarian Zhang Yi with the qualities of being tall, brave, and honest. These all seem to be imagined out of thin air.</p>
<p>The director also forgot to introduce the background and life of the socialite. If there were no instructions, it would almost make the audience think she was a dancer. There is also no thorough indication of the evils of the city and the serpentine nature of the beauty. What it shows on the screen is only a part of the fickle socialite.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi is the best among the actors. His resolute performance is commendable. Chen Yanyan's specialty in being lovable is not fully developed here. Wang Guilin and Wang Moqiu can still be called competent. Liu Jiqun's urban gentleman style in a few short scenes is quite experienced.</p>
<p>The first half of the entire play is slightly commendable, but the second half lacks many highlights, such as Zhang Yi's madness after losing favor and the final car speeding. Also, Chen Yanyan waiting for Zhang Yi's return, from dusk to dawn, reflecting the sleeping son, has the flavor of "Madame Butterfly." However, the photography is poor, and the light is too dim.</p>
<h3>Some Information about Joan Lowell, the Star of "Heroic Adventure"</h3>
<p>— Guo Cheng</p>
<p>Joan Lowell (also the star of the latest Didi Huaxin film "Heroic Adventure") grew up in Berkeley, California. She was the eleventh child in her family. Her mother was a cousin of the poet (James Russell Lowell). Her father was the owner of a small sailing ship. When Joan was only eleven months old, he took her to sea to live on the ship, until she was seventeen years old. In these ten years, she grew up looking like a boy. She already understood all the trivial matters on the ship and was willing to do them. When she was seventeen years old, her father sent her ashore and said to her, "From now on, you should hold the helm of your life and sail on the road of your life."</p>
<p>She ran ashore in ill-fitting clothes and began to try various jobs. She worked like a student who was working and studying at the same time, doing her job during the day and running to night school to study in the evening. She also became a professional swimmer.</p>
<p>She is also able to write. She wrote an amazing adventure novel, "The Cradle of the Deep." After its publication, more than 100,000 copies were sold out in a few weeks, and this book was selected as the best work of the month. This was in April 1929.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Joan Lowell often wrote novels and articles and submitted them to *Cosmopolitan* and *The Saturday Evening Post* for publication, and received countless praises and honors from various groups in society.</p>
<p>She traveled to various places like a newspaper travel reporter. In April 1933, she and her 76-year-old father and two sailors cruised around the world.</p>
<p>She is five feet four inches tall and weighs one hundred and seventeen pounds. She is also an aviator, a skilled equestrian woman, a hunting expert, and a swimming champion. She is proficient in all kinds of sports. She is a rare genius woman.</p>
<h3>Mei Lin's Marriage: A World Oddity</h3>
<p>Mei Lin, a rising star of Lianhua that is most anticipated by general movie fans, her film "Carefree Gentleman" is of course also a film that people are eagerly looking forward to. We can report to everyone that "Carefree Gentleman" will soon meet with social figures, and Mei Lin has succeeded in this film.</p>
<p>It is naturally a gratifying thing for Mei Lin to succeed in one fell swoop. If we talk about the marriage affairs in the two films "Carefree Gentleman" and "Tian Lun" made by Mei Lin, then it is an extremely ridiculous thing. In "Carefree Gentleman," after she married Han Langan, she married Liu Jiqun again. Now, not long after marrying Han and Liu, she married Zheng Junli again in "Tian Lun." However, her marriage with Zheng Junli in "Tian Lun" was a combination of love, and there was a lot of struggle before marriage. As for her marriage with Han and Liu, even Mei Lin herself did not know how the wedding was held. A woman has gone through two marriages with two men without knowing it herself. Such a thing cannot be said to be a world oddity.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Duke of Wellington (The Iron Duke) (7)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Hope was extinguished, the army collapsed, and Napoleon, like a defeated eagle, immediately fled back to Paris. He fought for a hundred days, which is the famous Hundred Days War in history. His talent and power were certainly no less than before, but fortune was against him, and the general situation was gone. As the saying goes, the collapse of the army is like the collapse of a mountain, and who can save it? The price of Napoleon's hundred days was being exiled to Saint Helena Island.</p>
<p>A month later, the kings and ministers of various countries reconvened the peace conference in Paris to divide the spoils of victory. The Duke of Wellington, as a military man, was not accustomed to the business of weighing the pros and cons, but he was now assigned as one of the ministers. Watching these masters of Europe argue and roar, and contend in the same way as before, he could not help but feel a little contempt. King Louis XVIII of France had now returned to Paris and ascended the throne again. Beside him still stood the daughter of Marie Antoinette, arrogant and domineering, and wanting to monopolize national power like her mother. Outside Louis' bedroom, the Duke of Wellington paced back and forth, his heart in a mess. After a while, the door of the bedroom opened, but no minister came out to summon Wellington. Duchess Annorel walked out instead. She walked up to Wellington and stopped, with a sneer on her lips. Wellington said calmly, "I am honored to be received by the Duchess, but the one I want to see is His Majesty the Emperor." The Duchess said, "I am his advisor. His Majesty is not himself today." Wellington said, "You arrested General Nan Yi. If you execute him, then France will inevitably start another civil war. You have created a martyr of Nan Yi's name."</p>
<p>The Duchess could not help but stare with hatred and said, "I only seek revenge for my father and mother. You are trying to deprive the French monarch of the ability to avenge, so I hate you deeply. I will definitely get rid of you no matter what..." Wellington said, "If you execute General Nan Yi by firing squad, the future will be unthinkable." The Duchess said even more angrily, "That will be seen soon. He must be executed by firing squad!" Wellington restrained his anger and said coldly, "On the day that happens, I will expel you and the other advisors from the palace." The Duchess turned her head and said, "I will convey your words to His Majesty." She said and went in.</p>
<p>Inside the Royal Theatre of Paris, the lights were shining brightly, illuminating it as if it were daytime. Women in grand attire, the wives of Allied generals, accompanied by their majestic husbands, were seated in the boxes. In the special box in the middle, Duchess Annorel and the Duke of Cottoya, the brother of King Louis of France, were seated. Beside the royal box were the Prussian King and the Russian Tsar, etc. They were all surrounded by attendants and adjutants. In a smaller and less tea-splendorous box slightly away from Duchess Annorel, the Duke of Wellington and Duchess Francis were seated.</p>
<p>At this time, Wellington said to Francis, "I must say, it was a foolish thing for you to come to Paris. You have your husband; he is now in London." Francis looked at Wellington and said, "I came for you." Wellington said, "What difference does that make? You are still a little fool." At this moment, six pairs of eyes in the royal box were staring at the two of them. The owner of the third pair of eyes was a man with a rat's head and mouse eyes, and a shabby appearance. He was the Paris correspondent of a London newspaper. (To be continued)</p>
