<p>時評</p>
<h3>論法意親交之影響恒</h3>
<p>大戰而後。法於歐洲大陸。儼然以盟主自居。意大利雖亦爲恊約之一。然英法當時勸其加入恊約之種種口惠。兌現無幾。失意之餘。隨以憤懣。對於法之地位。不勝其嫉視。而其進窺巴爾幹半島問鼎中歐之野心。亦幾不能自歛。以是不論在任何塲合。每與法國積不相能。其尤著者。如對於法之與國羅馬尼亞。頻送秋波。冀其合作。而對法人世仇之德國。又曾與之曲意聯歡。以謀不利於法。卽以其最近之翼卵身匈而論。初意未始不在謀與凡爾賽統系下之小恊約相對抗。至其用爲抗拒德國之前衛。特爲窺破希特勒圖奥野心以後之安排耳。故法意之矛盾衝突。不僅由來已久。抑且裂痕甚深。今能捐棄前嫌。共謀合作。不能謂非國際關係上一大轉變也。</p>
<p>按法意之合作。始於去夏德國圖奥之時。故溯其醖釀經過。爲時已非一日。唯至馬賽慘案發生。一時幾至停頓卒以法意雙方各具誠意。合作之機。仍未消滅。三數月來。秘密談判。無時不在進行中。然以兩國過去關係之複雜。希望志趣之不同。欲求妥恊。確乎甚難。故賴伐爾羅馬之行。屢見延期。今賴氏旣已成行。則法意談判之進行。當無重大之阻礙矣。</p>
<p>法意合作之内容何若。迄今尚鮮詳確之消息。蓋兩國皆諱莫如深。不欲有所洩漏。以是已傅出者是否可靠。亦須俟之他日。始能明曉。唯據吾人推測。法意間之重要問題。不外四端而已（一）爲北非殖民地之重新分配。（二）爲保障奥國之獨立。（三）爲凡爾賽和約之修改。（四）爲海軍之平等。此數問題。法意立塲顯然不同。今將以何種方式趨向於妥恊。殊足令人玩味。觀近日歐電。法意海軍平等問題。雙方皆擱置不談。此殆由意方之讓步所致。同時法國對於中歐修約主張。已爲有條件之接受。卽凡不以暴力爲手段之修約主張。法國皆有考慮之餘地。此則又爲法國讓步之表示也。至於奥國獨立問題。吾人曾聞美報喧傅。謂意國固希望關係各國共同爲奥國作保障。而尤望各國委以全權。俾一旦有事。可出兵助奥。若此一消息而確。則意之對奥。大有視爲特殊利益區域之槪矣。數日前曾聞法意談判因奥國獨立問題而發生障碍。衝突之點。或卽在是歟。今談判已重趨於順利。豈意方已不再固執前議耶。抑對殖民地之分配已獲得相當之滿意耶。此中内幕。固非局外人所得而知也</p>
<p>就今賴伐爾訪意之一舉而觀法意合作。前途似甚樂觀此事若能告成。則歐洲局面至少可獲小康。蓋修約主張。雖未必可以和平方法實現。而意法合作。仍足使中歐主張修約諸國。失却有力之領導。再則奥國旣受沿邊各國之保障。則德國併奥之志。必更難以舒展。故無論德國有無參加保障之可能。事實上必不致因其拒絶參加而發生影響也。然則謂法意携手有與法俄携手。同等之功用。亦無不可也。一言以蔽之。法意接近之目的有二。一則在阻止德國向東北之發展。一則在阻止德國向東南之發展。按其實質。皆所以維持歐洲之現狀。以求一時之安定也。</p>
<h3>羅斯福咨文國會謀取民生安定</h3>
<p>承認國際情勢日趨惡化</p>
<p>希望穩健領袖起挽狂瀾</p>
<p>力避牽入世界戰爭漩渦</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日下午十二時三十分親向參衆兩院聯席會議宣讀行政咨文、宣稱、爲謀取美國人民安寗起見、彼將建議一廣大計劃、以期實現下列各點、（一）利用天然富源、謀取全國人民生活之安全、（二）保障生活之安定、（三）保障高尚家庭之安全、總統復稱、吾人受人民之明白付托、美國人必須剷除以私人勢力操縱公私事業而獵取富貴之觀念、爲完成上述目的起見、吾人不欲毁棄慾望、亦不欲均分財富、吾人仍認若干人因其雄才大略、應得較多之報酬也、總統繼稱、個人謀取適當之安寗合理之閑暇、以及高尚之生活之慾望、實較勝於希圖財富權勢之野心、總統建議在政府經濟能力範圍以内、將各公共工程計劃合併爲規模較大之計劃、而聯邦政府則不復負担救濟事業、總統追述一九三四年之復興成績、謂農民已得實際利益、工商業均已欣欣向榮、此足告慰者也、總統繼</p>
<h3>論及國際關係</h3>
<p>稱余實不能直言國境之外形勢已有進步、蓋國際間之宿讐與昔日之野心均復抬頭。若干國家面目猙獰競爭軍備與勢力、深望冷靜及穩健之領袖或能以其大力挽此狂瀾、更希望得一穩健之國際領袖、終將以新而切於實際之代議政府供獻於全世界云、總統咨文後排除美國將捲入戰爭漩渦之說、並斥國際合作不能裁减或限制軍備之謬說、總統於此稱、維持國際和平實爲吾人深切關心之事、且無自私之意、對於預防戰禍、吾人已一再有具體表示、故實無理由妄測美國與任何國之關係、除和平之外、尚别有野心也云云、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>政黨一致贊助</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日下午十二時三十分親向參衆兩院聯席會議宣讀咨文、獲得民主黨及共和黨之一致贊助、參院民主黨領袖魯賓遜稱、此咨文爲美國歷史上最重要咨文之一、並預測二黨議員將人同努力、以求實現總統之意旨、魯賓遜繼稱、關於細則方面固不無異議、但信國會對於總統之計劃及目的、定能一致表示滿意也、共和黨領袖對此態度不如是積極、但亦滿心擁護總統之計劃、並表示完全合作以求其實現、參院共和黨領袖麥克那萊稱其爲目光遠大之咨文、共和黨參議員亦異口同聲表示贊同、衆院共和黨領袖史納爾對於總統之咨文不欲批評、但認總統之宣言、可爲政府右傾之表示云、若干觀察者特别注意羅斯福總統對於外交問題之意見、僉認總統之宣言在緩和局勢以避免日本廢棄華盛頓海軍條約後、英美日之造艦競爭、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>以工代賑减少失業</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日午後羅總統致國會之詞、其要點爲失業救濟、羅總統擬修改聯邦救濟之全部計畫、主張以工代賑、興辦大規模公共工程而廢止施捨辦法、羅總統指此可造成保障社會安寗的新秩序、羅總統聲明政府卽將在政府穩健信用之範圍内、採行一種計畫、並謂此種工作包括頗廣、私人資本不能辦理之肅清貧民窟吧及廣築鄉村住屋·普遍電氣用途·推廣森林·防止土壤腐蝕·開闢荒地·改良路政·建築公路·與國家所未可漠視之許多其他事業、皆將次第舉辦、此項大計畫、預料可吸收失業者三百五十萬人、渠已見信用精神恢復之表徵、但渠欲警告投機家與黨派政客、勿作阻礙吾人進行步驟之舉動、</p>
<h3>施捨破壞固有德性</h3>
<p>羅總統旋追述前有之臨時救急立法案、謂失業人數依然甚多、事實具在、足見以施捨爲救濟、乃麻醉物、徒摧殘爲人精神、及破壞美利堅固有德性耳云、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>聚歛致富應加排斥</h3>
<p>此外羅斯福總統宣稱、將於星期一日宣讀預算咨文、此項預算、當不超過政府所能動用經費之限度、總統並將卽向國會建議失業及養老保險·産婦及幼兒救濟等法案、此外如聯邦政府加强統制運輸事業之辦法、復興計畫之改革、司法制度及參戰軍人恊會制度之改革、限制濫用所有權、繼續統制農業等事、總統均將向國會提出諮詢、咨文中最後謂、（吾人所謂個人利益者、卽個人應有正當赡養自身及其家屬之權利之謂也、至於聚歛致富之觀念、則凡吾美國人均應加以排斥、蓋聚歛致富之結果、則個人可利用過分之利潤、以經營其私人業務、而公共業務、必因此蒙其不幸也）云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>外交政策睦隣爲尚</h3>
<p>述及外交政策、則謂希望各國政治家能以鎭靜及建設之精神、奠定國際政局、俾各國咸有必要之時間、以在全世界創立新式代議政府、庶幾特權階級可見减少、而一般大衆之福利則日見增加云、總統咨文中更謂、（目前任何國家、縱使其志不在和平、然與吾美國亦不至有衝突之慮、現有一種謬誤理論、以爲過度之軍備、不能以國際恊定加以縮减及限制、因此乃至人民有增加軍備負擔之虞、然大部分國家之人民對於由此種謬誤理論所造成之結果、必能設法加以克服、此則固無疑義者也）云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>白宮開會草擬救濟工作新程序</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）據今日此間公佈、羅總統現繼續减發聯邦官吏俸給百分之五、以六個月爲期、一般供職政界者希望新年後可恢復全薪、今復失望、而須待諸半年之後矣、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福面前突來不速之客</h3>
<p>退伍軍人要求津貼被拘</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羣衆歡迎總統之呼聲響遏行雲、惟總統入國會時、有一退伍軍人、一再高呼（吾儕欲津貼）、致爲警察暫行拘禁、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今午赴國會宣讀咨文時、有一不識姓名者、趨至總統身前、相距已不過數公尺、當經警察拘獲、一般人相信其人、當係共産黨員、意欲向總統辱駡云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>發表公報</h3>

<h3>保障中歐和平公約締結有望</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾今晨舉行首次重要會議、有順利直下之勢、締結公約以保障歐洲和平已大有希望、匈牙利對奥問題之保留態度致不得不成立一種臨時辦法以事維護匈牙利之權利、匈牙利對此滿意後、歐局前途遂趨樂觀、意法政府現確切贊同奥國獨立必須維持、保奥獨立之公約將邀德意志南斯拉夫捷克及匈牙利等國參加、匈牙利已表示有條件贊成、至於匈牙利之條件卽爲彼仍將保留其修改聖日耳曼條約之一貫政策、惟允使其行動不逸出國聯盟約之範圍、因此彼决不以戰爭或任何暴力爲實現其國家志願之工具、此外墨索里尼與賴伐爾並允釐定黎比亞邊境及突尼斯境内意人之新地位、此二問題久已成爲二國間之禍根、今晨首次會議於十一時卅分始散、法外長賴伐爾卽晋謁意王、約半小時始退、（五日國民電）</p>

<h3>匈感不安</h3>
<p>匈京法國外長賴伐爾羅馬之行、似頗引起匈牙利之煩惱與不安、匈牙利電報通信社評論此事、謂羅馬法意談判、不至提及保障領土公約之問題、蓋以保障領土公約如一旦訂立、以和平手段修改和約、勢將無法辦到也、因此羅馬談判結果如何、均不當使匈牙利之政府原則、受其影響云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>布逹佩斯此間對於法外長賴伐爾及意首相墨索里尼之談話、極爲注意、因羅馬恊定實使意匈關係密切也、至於修改條約問題、半官方面謂墨氏將本其初衷、以維護匈國之利益、而以承認匈國之要求、爲保持多瑙河流域之唯一辦法、據報紙載稱、匈牙利之命脈與意德息息相關、而對德之政治經濟關係尤屬必要、匈牙利不能承認法報所云德爲法意匈之公敵、實際上匈國希望德意合作也、（四日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本大受賄案之内幕（日本通信）</h3>
<p>政黨受莫大影響</p>
<p>財界感無窮困難</p>
<p>日本近年來非常時期流行之餘、受賄貪贜之案件亦層見疊出、在各重大案件中、尤以財政部事件爲最著、蓋是案牽聯財政次長黑田英雄·銀行局長大久保偵次·并涉及前鐵道總長三土忠造·商工總長中島久萬吉男爵·及其他銀行界實業界有力人物多名、齋藤内閣且因此受議會抨撃、閣員旣受不名譽牽聯、因閣遂由是而倒、</p>
<p>追溯此事件之發生、緣於台灣銀行放欵於鈴木商社、該社自世界戰爭告終後、卽受經濟市面不佳影響、致營業難於繼續、其所借台灣銀行之欵、更無法償還、當時台灣銀行·亦以放欵過於放任、致有三萬萬五千萬放出之欵、不能如期收回、於是該行除在台灣本島及海外分行勉强維持以外、在日本各行、竟暫告停業、其後乃由日本銀行出而維持救濟、通融現欵至一萬萬以上、乃克重行開業、台灣銀行所持鈴木商社經營各事業之股票、遂多進入日本銀行庫中、歸日本銀行管理、而帝國人造絲股份有限公司股票、卽其一焉、一九三二年後、日本輕工業向上發展、棉布輸出日漸增加、人造絲織品更見興盛、帝國人造絲公司、乃同受其惠、營業突趨發逹、匪但庫無存貨、且兩三個月出品、亦預定一空、於是該公司股票、逐步飛漲、高至股票票面價格二倍有奇、</p>
<p>當時台灣銀行總經理島田茂·鑑於大利當前、不甘放棄、乃密謀於帝國人造絲公司總經理高木復亨·董事岡崎旭·監查河合良成等、共商如何越過財政部、如何瞞過日本銀行、備欵將帝國人造絲公司股票十萬股、自該行取出、分賣與東京及大阪兩地、以朋分其利益、當時并商定該公司去年下期紅利分配增加百分之三、該公司股票遂更飛漲、近於每股二百元之市價、而出賣之價格、則僅每股一百二十五元、台灣銀行因此所受損失、殆在一千二百萬元以上矣、</p>
<p>島田等謀定之後、乃分頭進行取出股票及出賣股票之舉、又以該項股票約有數十萬股、進出資金·須在千萬以上、故週轉上竟成問題、而對於從中週旋諸人、至不能以現金相報、於是提出帝國人造絲公司股票一千三百股、分别酬勞有關諸人、據傅前財次黑田英在雄得四百股（市價略値六萬元）、前鐵道總長三土忠造三百股、（約値四萬五千元）前商工總長中島久萬吉二百股、（値三萬元）前銀行局局長大久保偵次一百股、（値一萬五千元）、如此分配、在一千數百萬元巨利中、不過百分之二而已、夫三土忠造及中島久萬吉兩氏、皆屬一時名流、同時又爲政友會之要角、財政界之鉅子、黑田氏在財政部中、亦一時之選、不意今日同蒙此受賄之嫌疑、甚爲世人所異、惟三土氏迄尚不承認受賄、并列舉事實、謂彼絶未接受該項股票、及掉換現疑、且確舉東京地方裁判所舉時日之錯誤、以明自身並無關係、同時財政部方面、亦公言財部牽聯諸人、必不受賄、將來自有水落石出之日云云、因此更引起一大問題、卽豫審時之非刑拷問口供、致各被告不得已揑造事實是也、推論至此、則司法權之神聖、及蹂𨈆人道、又成一大問題矣、總之、此事關係日本政治前途甚大、設使裁判所檢舉而確、政治界將蒙空前之惡名、若三土等之否定而果不誤、則司法精神亦歸掃地、二者何從、可待將來事實以證明之也、（十二月二十八日於東京）</p>

<h3>九戰九勝東華克沙谷爾</h3>
<p>七對零</p>

<p>上半時五比零沙谷爾首先開球、當被東華截住回撃、衝鋒陷陣、約計五分鐘、符質彬自右包抄、卡莫夫見狀心急、在離門三十碼之處、橫施絆攔、洪光主踢任意球、對門直飛、守將欲救、祇只着其邊際、無補事實、一對零先開紀錄、符質彬小將威風、又盤潛而入、一脚攻門、適在門角飛入、時已十五分鐘、阿瑟篤被罰十二碼、李義臣造成大三元之數、千餘球迷、樂極忘形、小萬自左進窺、李義臣帶之而進、暗渡陳倉、符質彬又告獲中、顧尚勷旋又得任意球機會、符家小將、的是可人、再中紅心、上半時五對零、</p>
<p>下半時二比零戴中鋒因傷缺席、東華虎將、不因之而影響、亦可喜之事、下半時開始後、東華進攻之形勢、似較趨和緩、而在若輩沙谷爾、則仍在作困獸之鬥、易陣後之七分鐘、符質彬又在敵人後方盤旋、見機送球、義臣飛頭一頂、果然頭上開花、合計東華已獲六球、最後萬象華低傅中央、李義臣捉而未得、賈幼良凑成七比零之鉅數、以完成此一塲一面倒比賽沙谷爾諸番、垂頭喪氣、東華會</p>

<h3>興趣是成功之母</h3>
<p>— 珠明</p>
<p>人無論做什麽事，總要有興趣。纔高興地去做，所做的事，也纔會發逹，讀書當然同是這様的。</p>
<p>學校功課門類，有許多種，都是人生的普通一般常識，不可不知道一些，所以對於各門功課，都要有興趣去研究。</p>
<p>不過各門功課中，各人各有認爲那一種是最有興趣的課，各自不同，這就如喫東西一般，有人歡喜喫鹹的，有人歡喜喫甜的，口味不同，自然喜歡喫的，也就不同了。這種不同情形，是由於個性的相近與不相近的緣故。</p>
<p>譬如有的小朋友喜歡圖畫，對於圖畫特别發生興趣，將來有成功美術家希望；有的小朋友喜歡數學，對於數學特别發生興趣，將來有成功數學家希望；假使教喜歡圖畫的去算數學，算得必不十分對；又教喜歡數學的去畫圖畫，畫得也必不十分好；就是因爲個性不相近，所以興趣没有那様濃厚，成績因之相形見拙。</p>
<p>大生物家逹爾文的個性，是喜歡研究生物的，所以在小學時，旁的功課，雖然比較差一些，但他並不是貪頑，是因爲感覺旁的功課興趣，没有生物的興趣濃厚吧了。</p>
<p>在這例子上，貢獻小朋友，讀書要發生興趣，雖然有些不適於個性的課，因爲它是常識，不可忽略；至於很適個性的課，要特别練習，就是你將來成功之母。</p>
<p>世界名人成功，都是由於幼年興趣上感覺，再加不斷的努力得來，小朋友，這興趣是多麽的寳貴？</p>
<h3>小青年團</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>愛倫凱女士清楚的告訴我們：二十世紀是兒童的世紀，不差，兒童的世紀，可是，怎様的來表揚我們兒童的精神，顯示我們兒童的特質，發展我們兒童的才能？</p>
<p>本學期徐公橋中心小學區八個小學校，都組織了一個小青年團。内以陶冶品性，鍜鍊身體，研究學問爲宗旨，計每團都有團長團副之分，近來都以新生活作訓練目標，預備在禮義廉恥下做一個有規律的人。</p>
<p>最近，在中心校裹舉行大會操和新生活演說競進會，精神飽滿，秩序井然，很得當地及外來人士的贊許。</p>
<p>今年寒假裹，擬同當地民衆混合組織冬防隊，爲大衆作切實的服務。</p>
<p>小朋友！别再沉默了！現在是兒童的世紀，快起來振作一下吧！</p>
<h3>好學生</h3>
<p>— 萬竹小學二年級生曹梅瑛</p>
<p>小學生，敬先生，先生講書細細聽，考試須要爭得第一名。</p>
<p>小學生，要靜心，靜心讀書人人敬，爸媽見我心裹也歡欣。</p>
<p>小學生，要潔凈，身體衣裳要當心，注重衛生免得多疾病。</p>
<p>小學生，要勤謹，放學回家功課温，温熟功課大考不憂心。</p>
<p>小學生，要孝順，敬愛爸媽最要緊，爸媽教訓須要記在心。</p>
<p>小學生，要正經，不說謊話來騙人，這様才是一個好學生。</p>
<h3>大掃除</h3>
<p>— 玲</p>
<p>前天早上到校時，看見許多同學都拿了掃帚畚箕在街上掃除，個個人都興高彩烈的在工作着，他們都變成臨時的清道夫了。</p>
<p>十一點半到了，我們便開始掃除課室，掃地呀，擦玻璃呀，揩黑板呀，排桌子呀，個個人都有工作，一時雜亂之聲，連續不斷，從各課室内傅播出來。十二點鐘後，各課室内和半點鐘以前大不相同了，各様東西，都是整齊清潔，好像一個壞人立刻變成好人了。</p>
<p>掃除是除去汚穢的東西，使這地方率成整潔，最好把人的心地也掃得乾凈，不使汚穢的念頭留在心中。</p>
<p>這次的大掃除，不但是使得地方清潔，使我們覺得掃除的益處和掃除的方法，而且感到這一次掃除的有趣，便時常在家中帮助母親灑掃。將來養成一種勤勞的習慣，對於自已有很大的利益，如果别人不來帮助你掃附，你自已也會做了，並且不感到困難，這眞是大掃除給我的恩賜。</p>
<h3>互助</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>燈草跳舞</h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！你們在校裹表演過嗎？可曾表演過跳舞呢？跳舞對於全身的肌肉如筋骨發逹都很平均的，能使身體健而美。</p>
<p>可是今天有一個極好玩的游戲，便是燈草也能跳舞。用一根燈草，把它都摘成一分長，隨便的放在桌上。另用小方白紙一張，在炭火上面一燻，放在桌上馬上用大拇指甲，在紙的上面摩擦幾下，乘熱的時候移到燈草上面，距離約半时，放在桌上的燈草，好像跳舞似的，統統被吸到紙上。</p>
<p>物理學上告訴我們；紙兒借着炭火一烘的熱力，又受了指甲的摩擦而生電感，燈草便是受着電熱力的吸引。</p>
<h3>兒童衣服之改進</h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>孩子們的活潑與否，一半固因受外界的感陶。但一半也因環境的不同而有異。中國孩子在大人們不知兒童教育爲何物的監視之下，勉勵孩子們要（文靜，）要和大人一般的端坐着聽講話，孩子也無從活潑的了！加以孩子們穿的都是寛衣長袍，行動旣不方便，也無法活潑的了！這並不是中國孩子的天生呆頭呆腦，實在是大人們養成他們呆頭呆腦的模様。在中國，没有（童裝）這名目，男孩子長袍馬褂，有時還戴一隻瓜皮小帽；女孩子也是旗袍及踝，行動起來，施施然有成人之風，自幼養成呆滯的行動要想日後成爲矯健的軀體，自然是難事了。我們看看西洋孩子們，他們個個伶俐活潑，孩子們有孩子們的裝束，凡不到十六七歲的男孩，不能穿長褲；不到十六七歲的女孩不能穿高跟鞋與婦人的服裝。他們的大人們對於孩童，不隨便，也不放縱，以大部的精力，灌注在兒童身上，使他們養成一個活潑愉快的心身。這是不錯的，孩童是國家未來的主人哪！</p>
<p>我國兒童的服裝，我以爲亟應改良，孩子們絶對不宜穿長衣，並且也宜少穿爲是。我國俗諺：（若要孩子不去醫，常帶三分寒和飢。）可是一般父母們，大都溺愛子女，把孩子穿得如不倒翁般，這是反而使孩子們養成嬌軀弱質，愛之反而害之。西洋孩子大都至多穿了兩三件衣服，冬天還着了短褲的，有人說這因西洋人體格强健，所以不致凍壞，中國人是要凍壞的，殊不知從小如此鍜鍊體格，身子自能漸漸强健的了。至於童裝的式様則參照西式也好，能創造新式也好，總之要合乎衛生，和兒童活潑自由行動的需要，兒童是我們的繼續者，是新中國的未來主人翁，不要太漠視了兒童啊！</p>
<h3>童話故事</h3>
<p>— 秦倩佩女士作</p>
<p>（一）勞動者終日在他主人的鞭策之下，一刻不能自由，這回他見主人在車上睡熟了，他就稍能安心的坐在車前打盹，那個没得飯吃，專靠打刦過活的壤東西看見了，他說啊好機會來了，一個又肥又胖的大富翁，（二）他把羊繋在車上，自已騎在背上，叫羊快點兒跑，（羊跑了，車中的富翁，在甜蜜的夢中被他驚醒，車前的勞動者也跌下地來。</p>
<h3>蘋果做的時鐘</h3>
<p>— 召日</p>
<p>小朋友，這裹將要教你們一種很有趣味的玩意兒，就是用果子中的蘋果來做一只時鐘。這様用自已的力量做的玩具，比賣外國玩具要勝過許多許多呢！</p>
<p>材料：一個大蘋果，一把小刀，三根竹籤和白紙一張。</p>
<p>製法：先用小刀把蘋果切成（圖１）和（圖２）的形狀；第二，將第二圖用一根竹籤穿進插成（圖３）的様子；第三，把白紙剪成圓形，寫上數目字，當中的中心也須用黑紙條剪成鐘的長短針形，參看（圖４）。你瞧一隻很伶俐巧妙的時鐘不是完成了嗎？</p>
<h3>圖１</h3>
<h3>圖２</h3>
<h3>圖３</h3>
<h3>圖４</h3>
<p>（附白）當你剪長短針時，要很小心地工作，否則要剪斷的。又第二圖不可切的太大，因爲太大了便很不美觀的。如果將這只美麗的蘋果鐘擺設在精緻的處所，是非常够瞧哩。</p>
<h3>最冷與最熱</h3>
<p>— 楊鞭</p>
<p>小朋友，世界上最冷的東西，是些什麽，在那裹？最熱的東西，是些什麽，在那裹？我想你們一定時常要知道的罷！好，現在我來報告你們。</p>
<p>世界上最冷的地方是西伯利亞北部的一個小鎭呌做法可楊司克，那裹的氣温，最冷的時候，竟在華氏零下九○·四度。這様冷的氣温，可使水銀凝固。</p>
<p>介在各星球中間的空間的氣温，爲華氏零下四五四度，這可說是自然界中最低的温度了。</p>
<p>我們人類所造成的最低温度，是固體的氣，它的温度是華氏零下四四七·八度，與冷的極點華氏零下四五九·四度，也相差無幾了。</p>
<p>再講熱吧。我們知道世界上最熱的地方，是薩哈拉大沙漠，那裹的氣温最高逹華氏七三六度。一切生物當然都不能生存了。地球的中心，爲華氏六，○○○度。</p>
<p>太陽是一個火球，它的温氣當然高得可觀。據愛丁頓教授的計算，它的中心的温度約有華氏七二，○○○，○○○度。就是它的外層也有三，六○○度呢。</p>
<p>至於人類所造成的最高温度，是四五，○○○度，比太陽光强一百倍，眞是熱透了啊！</p>
<h3>禽言獸語</h3>

<p>（二）狗的眼睛不能辨顔色，它看見不論什麽東西，總連聲說）黃黃黃。）</p>
<p>（三）羊是很孝順的，常常喊（媽媽媽媽。）</p>
<p>（四）鴨是樂觀派，常常聽見它笑的聲音（哈哈哈哈哈哈。）</p>
<p>（五）貓性貪，它見了老鼠快樂地說（妙妙。）</p>
<p>（六）蛙是患傷風者，它常常（咯咯咯咯咯咯。）</p>
<p>（七）鵝的脾氣最壤。它常常駡人（戇大戇大。）</p>
<p>（八）老鼠也讀過大學，而且是口吃的，它總說（知止知止。）</p>
<p>（九）猪的塊頭大，但是常常氣得連話也不肯說，它總朶起著嘴（呼呼呼呼呼。）</p>
<p>（十）燕子的說話又不同，當它春天回來時，總說（好住，住住。不好住，不住。）</p>
<h3>水手辛白德傳（一）</h3>
<p>— 心青</p>
<p>水手辛白德傅，是歐州一種極著名的兒童讀物。辛白德航行七次，歷盡艱辛，而仍然是不屈不撓，履險如夷，像這様的埋頭苦幹的冒險精神，是應當介紹於我國的小朋友們，作爲榜様的。因便很忠實的譯了出來，貢獻於春秋兒童周刋。</p>
<p>辛白德的第一次航行</p>
<p>當我父親死時，他遺給我的財産很豐厚，但過了多時，我狂放無度的，將我的光陰和金錢都耗費掉了。末後我便决意改變我的生活狀况，於是賣去了全部的田地和貨物，和一班將到海外去做買賣的人動身出去。</p>
<p>我們搭了一艘良好的船離去白爾沙拉，啓程往東印度。我們到了各處，將我們的貨物做得很好的買賣。</p>
<p>一個晴美而恬靜的日子，我們攏近了一個碧綠的小島，據船上水手們的領袖和我們說；倘我願意上岸時，儘可上岸。可是我們正樂於伸伸我們的腿，於是有一班人都坐了小艇傍岸去。</p>
<p>我們在這島上過着很好的時光，因爲重行在那堅實的土地上散步，是很快意的。但是驀然之間，那地却動搖起來。船中的人瞧見了這個，即忙做手勢喚我們趕快上船去。原來我們以爲是陸地的却並不是，不過是一尾大鯨魚的背罷了！</p>
<p>我們一行人中有的已進了小艇划回船去，有的跳入海中游泳過去；但我仍在那鯨魚背上，驀地裹它一翻身直到海底。</p>
<p>這一來可使我處在一個奇怪的境界中了。我恰在這當兒抓住了一大塊木，我們本帶來作生火用的，倘不是這個，我定然沈没了。</p>
<p>我向四面一瞧，見我的朋友都已上船，恰有一陣順風起來，那船便立刻開行；不一會已不見了。</p>

<h3>（今年的我）專號</h3>
<p>— 孟君</p>
<p>又是新年。</p>
<p>在以前，我害怕過新年，就像我不高興我一年一度的生日到來一様，我總覺得牠帶走了一些什麽，而留給我的也并不是令人炫眼的希望。</p>
<p>現在，我改變了那種心境。相反，在新年還未到來時，我居然也像小孩子，對新年的期待一様，我也在等待着。因爲我想結算過去，也想開始一些新的計劃。</p>
<p>我的計劃并没有什麽可以誇張的，但牠對我自已却是一種堅實的鞭策，我要拿牠來，做本年衡量時日是否浪費的尺度。</p>
<p>自然，我并不是有閑階級，我每天得拿八小時的時間去換生活費，我不是拿工作來打發時間。但時代的責任是放在每一個人的肩上的，我祗是願適當的肩負起我所能負的一部份責任。</p>
<p>一，我在和朋友們計劃辦一個托兒所，在南京，現在還没有。想使大羣的婦女有時間參加社社活動，來做推進時代的一份子，設法减輕他們對小孩的負擔是必要的。我們也知道少數的托兒所，所能救助的婦女也祗是少數，但以事實作宣傅，影響是不會很小的。</p>
<p>二，辦補習學校：我們都是自已旣没有錢，又没有慈善家或大官先生們作靠山的一羣，所有的祗是些剩餘的時間和熱心。補習學校是根據這些客觀條件的。所以我們的計劃是在農民聚居地，或小工廠附近租借一兩間房子，聚集三五十個貧苦婦女，我們自已來當先生。自然，我們更希望由師生的關係，她們能給我們些實際的教訓，我們也能更多的帮助她們。</p>
<p>三，我們還有一個團體，去年剛組織，牠還没有逹到健全的地步。一九三五年將使牠漸漸健全起來，直至牠能肩負起更大更多的責任。</p>
<p>再則：我的知識和能力都還不够。而且時代又日在進步，在這不斷的進步中如何使自已不被時代打落，如何充實自已使與我願意負擔的工作相適應，這也是今年的我的打算之一。</p>
<p>一，理論的認識是行動的指南針，没有理論做基礎，工作是盲目的。在連翻譯工作都貧乏的中國，不能看外國文字的書，幾乎没有接收新理論的機會。因此，精習一種外國語，成了我個人迫切的需要。</p>
<p>二，讀書和寫作：除了普通雜誌之外，有系統的讀書是爲了充實我自已和帮助我更正確的行動。寫作也在我的計劃中。</p>
<p>因爲篇幅的限制，我祇能就此簡略的結束了。</p>
<p>一九三五，一，二日於南京。</p>
<p>— 蔡慕暉</p>
<p>今晨走到辦公處去，一跨出電梯，就有人對我說ＨＡＰＰＹＮＥＷＹＥＡＲ。我自然也得回個ＨＡＰＰＹＮＥＷＹＥＡＲ，雖則我的心裹，實在没有半點過新年的情趣。進房間，看見桌上堆了許多郵件，一一拆看之後，呌我覺得好生羞慚，因爲我已好幾年没有爲親友們寄賀年片了。</p>
<p>過去，在新年將近的時候，老早就剜空心思印製賀片之類的事情確是有過的。在除夕的燭光中，和姊妹們大談其來年計劃的事兒，我也是常常幹的。可是近幾年來，因爲（事出意外常八九，符合計劃無二三）的生活經騐太多，已令我失却印賀片談計劃的興緻了。前些日子茲九女士約我寫一段（今年的我）我就因爲這個緣故不肯答允。昨晚她在電話中指定要我寫出國的消息，我因爲再找不出推却的理由來，今晚祇好把自已關在冰冷的房間裹寫幾句原來不預備寫的話。</p>
<p>反正茲九女士没有說年底必須做報告，卽使我的計劃不能實現，我也不必再向讀者道歉，我就大膽地寫下去罷，否則······</p>
<p>我的同工們，因爲我已做了七八年的機械工作，很想使我有出去換一換空氣的機會，前幾個月，已在費盡心機，爲我籌劃旅費接洽學校了。大約在夏末秋初的時候，我就可以成行了，我雖没有向她們表示什麽，心裹是很感激她們的好意的。她們爲我預定的遊歷期間是一年多點，遊歷路徑是先到美國後到歐洲。在紐約城裹，我大槪可以過幾個月學生生活，但我並没有想得學位的野心，祇想照自已的興趣，選讀一二種較有意思的課程。在這一次遊歷中，祇要能多遊歷幾個地方，多觀察各國人民的實際生活，多有幾個接觸各種思想的機會，我自已方面的希望已算滿足了。我的同工和朋友們，自然還有好些奢望，她們時常這様那様的叮囑我，但在這短短的期間中，怕有好些是做不到的，我現在還是不說的好。</p>
<p>前幾天，有一位朋友對我說（你喜歡我們爲你准備出一大批蠢問題嗎？那是你到美國後時常需要答復的。我們美國人最會發問蠢問題，没有經騐的人很容易被她們弄窘的。）我覺得她的話是對的，我雖没有出過國，已被美國人問窘過多次。所以在出國之前的七八個月中，我也許不能不將工餘的時間，多化些在准備答復蠢問題的蠢答案上面呢。</p>
<p>— 白薇</p>
<p>疾病和貧窮。可以消滅整個人底生命：我底一切，都給病毁完了。可是今年，總想從病的苦海裹翻身出來，以健康的姿態出現</p>
<p>如果我能上鏡頭：我願在農村破産及都會裹失業的貧民羣中，飾一個特别有個性的最悲慘的角色。因爲我有演悲劇的情熱，我有乍笑乍哭的（劇的性格），能代替她們喊出最深刻的悲痛。</p>
<p>如果我能當導演：我想在同一個世界舞臺塲面上牽一條槍械森嚴的界，一邊表演殖民地的吸血鬼，他們那獰猛的面目，陰險的手段，强暴駭人的權威，和蹻著荒淫的生活；）邊表演被高壓强迫的榨取，屠殺，在飢餓死亡和哭聲中掙扎的人們，他們在黑暗地獄中的光景。再從每個勞苦被壓迫者底身上，牽一條血汗亮晶的索兒直逹吸血鬼那邊，使化成大堆的金圓，給他們享樂，拿去供第二次世界大戰，給造成更多的殖民地，更多的奴隷。</p>
<p>把舞臺弄成這様强烈的對比，現實的寫眞，給觀業知道究竟誰該搶了那劃界的槍械，拿去打自已底敵人帝國主義者！</p>
<p>但這種熱望，是我能實行的嗎？要說今年的我，不能不把過去的我清算一下：我六年的慘病拖下來，弄得我像具活屍没有埋，我凄苦的生活，是没有人相信的。前年春，我關着房門倒床五天，没有誰知道，最先發覺我病重的，是王造時先生家底小大姐，她打開我底房門叫醒我，借了錢來帶我去紅十字會醫院看病，又去賭，赢了錢來給我吃藥。去年秋，我兇病連環不能醫，正當危急讓它病死時，意外地從一位素不相識的好人那裹收到些錢救活了命。</p>
<p>命算救活了，病入膏　仍不能動，債囊高築，生活凄苦，三四年買不起一本書一册雜誌。這様，我我活着還能做甚麽？何時債主迫我逃不脫，恐怕今年的報紙上，將有（白薇跳海自殺）的消息。那時，我這個常常被小報造謠的人，更不知小報上將用甚麽花様替我造謠？</p>
<p>— 君</p>
<p>我相信，人不能自已要怎様便怎様，剛剛相反，環境要你怎様便怎様，這或許是機械的客觀論，但我却以爲較近於眞理。照我的經騐看，人的能動力總敵不過環境的驅迫！</p>
<p>（今年的我），我想也和往年的我一様，縱有些什麽計劃，但到實行時，總會跟環境碰釘子的！所以我倒不願談什麽一年大計，不過，到了這個年初，　便不能不回到家鄉去了。這在我個人生活上確是一個大的變動，在這臨别的前夜，談談我幾年來滬上生活的感想吧。</p>
<p>我在上海賴以爲生的唯一生産手段就是Ｇ字筆頭，地球牌墨水及開明稿紙，在文化界素無文名的我，只能在一些（文商公）的包辦之下，當了把日本貨改頭換面作國貨的（譯書工人），工錢雖有限得很，但一家數口還不至於餓死，可是到了最近，出版界閙恐慌，尤其土産文化大出鋒頭，聰明的（文商公）見機改業，因之，我便成爲相給人榨取亦不可能的失業者了。其實，在上海失業而至於餓死凍斃是司空見慣的事，一想到這裹，不禁毛骨聳然！</p>
<p>不過，我倒不因此而至於失望，我相信這種現狀是不會維持多久的，世界總有一天没有失業恐慌的一日，今年的我，祇有期待着這一日的快些到來！</p>
<p>— 郭箴一</p>
<p>像這様一個渺小的我，浮沉在生活大海中，一年一年的過去，配不上來說甚麽今年。不過經騐的鞭，總得策着人回憶過去。憧憬未來。</p>
<p>爲文憑而讀書，爲出名而寫文，似乎是普遍的現象，經騐告訴我，爲充實自已的人生，除受生活的磨練外，需要自已多讀點有價値的書，今年希望寫點與人無害的文，買點與自已有益的書。</p>
<p>救國，辦社會事業，以及博社會好評的行爲，得人們贊許的舉動。似乎是自命不凡者的志願。經騐告訴我，在這畸形社會，這些都是（聰明人）用來欺騙平凡人的工具。今年希望認清人類進化史的方向，做人做事唯求不違反這大時代的潮流。</p>
<p>因謀增高自已的身望而投上政治舞臺，因謀顯露頭角而參加婦女運動。似乎是過去有人承認的出路。經騐告訴我，這些多半是個人主義者自私的思想與大衆婦女與痛苦人羣毫無關係的。今年希望，放大眼光，透視事物的核心，養成勇敢的，奮鬥的前進人生觀。以正確的意識，爲人所不肯爲，不屑爲的一點小小工作。</p>
<p>— 關露</p>
<p>新年來了，按照一般中國的慣例，新年是應該笑的。哭了可以爭取一年的順遂。但是，我怎麽様去哭呢？如果我是一個老太婆，我這一笑，一張口，牙掉下一個，我可以寛慰了：這靡亂窮苦的時光對我又减了一歲。如果我是一個幼齡女兒，新年早上一笑，嬌滴滴地呌聲（媽），一塊糖或一個湯圓卽刻掉進嘴裹。如果我現在有一個收入豐富的紳士丈夫，那麽，新年的前晚，我打扮起來，登上高跟鞋，腰扭兩扭，咯逹咯逹地走到我那靠在沙發上吸着烟斗的丈夫面前，（拍）的一聲在他的臉２頰上印上了一個紅嘴印子，隨着再抿着嘴向他瞟一眼，撲嗤一聲，連聲音和模様兒一併送進他那烟斗裹去。他把我攔腰一抱，我順便撒起嬌來：</p>
<p>（親親，我永遠是屬於你的，往後我再不和任何男友來往。但你也不許再拿錢去給别的女人胡花。今晚嘻嘻，我好好地······）。</p>
<p>這様，起碼我新年的麻雀費不成問題了。</p>
<p>但我什麽也不是，什麽也没有。有的只是我自已的勞力，和在勞力市塲裹帶回來的幾個鐵釘。那麽不笑就哭嗎？豈敢！在目前踐踏女性的社會裹，只贊成女人賣身體，不許女人賣勞力的社會制度裹，我們是正需要去努力爭鬥呢。現在，我們是旣不能笑，也不能哭，要努力地尋着同伴，把對於女人的（人肉市塲），改變成勞力市塲。</p>
<p>這啼笑皆非的我的新年！</p>
<p>— 姚惠蓮</p>
<p>我是個大學的初級生，在去年的元旦，就結了婚，因此，不能繼續求學。我的丈夫是個資産階級，他娶我的條件，是我的（美）。</p>
<p>我在家庭裹的地位，就算是（少奶奶），住的是三層樓的洋房，穿的是綢緞，坐的是汽車，總之，物質的享受是奢侈到極點，假使我是没有智識的話。那末，我儘管可以在這混濁的空氣裹埋葬一生。</p>
<p>但是，我現在决定同他離婚，離婚後的生活，是預備到工廠裹去做女工，想養成自立的能力，一方面是完成我素來的志願。</p>
<p>因爲，人，單單是個（生物的人），可說是不完全的人，做個（社會的人），才有人的意義，可算完全的人。</p>
<p>（少奶奶）的生活，充其量，不過是個賢母良妻的典型女子，說得明顯些，就是傅統觀念社會制度的犠牲品，因爲在這種方式裹，丈夫的意志就是我意志，我自已不能有自由的意志，這様我就等於丈夫的一件附屬品，換句話說，不過是他的洩慾器吧了。可是，我有天賦的自由與意志，應當改造我的現在的環境。</p>
<p>上工廠做工人，雖然，在一般資本家眼裹的工人，簡直是像牛馬一様看待，可是，工人究竟比他們拿工人們汗血産生的利潤坐汽車，住洋房，娶姨太太來得體面些，因此，我人去工作，去宣傅，去教導······使認識認識工人，這種義務也應當盡的，我想。</p>
<p>總括一句話，今年的我，不是資産階級的點綴品，而是一個完全獨立自由的人，並且，還要帮助别人成功完全獨立自由的人。</p>
<p>— 音</p>
<p>首先，請讓我用幾句話，說明以往的我罷。關此，借用某君愛用的一句名言，就够了，卽是：（失業，失業，第三個還是失業。）</p>
<p>多少年來，被失業壓霉了頭，而成了（職業絶緣體）的我，在今年也不會有多的出息罷！很幸運的，就在去年年底，有朋友告訴我，本埠某著名洋大學，便有一特設的職業指導科，專門指導職業的，其中不少中外的大學者從事指導，而我國年輕的男女學子，也有很多選了這一科作爲終身職業，而用着大學的四年光陰在那兒開始埋頭研究。</p>
<p>對於我，這眞比如來佛再世的消息，還要切乎實用。所以，今年的我，第一步就要像到麥加聖地去巡禮的回教徒一様，不管跋山涉水，我也要去覲見這些失業救星的職業指導專家。縱或不得其門而入，見不着大專家，他們的徒子徒孫，我也要拜見一二。萬一，第一步（失業）有了解决，今年的我，一切都可不成問題了。倘使幸而又得着了個中三　，那末，我想方法，定要在報端或雜誌尾，將個中奥妙公之於列位失業同志的。</p>
<p>— 靜波</p>
<p>我特别感到今年的活躍的新年，有一種强烈的啟示力量，劃時間的批判，現在與將來，怎様給我一種自覺的必要。</p>
<p>無論如何，脫離實踐是生活的危症！尤其，作爲被壓迫者的婦女的我！環繞在我周遭的：是貧與病的威脅：是安靜享受的卑微引誘；是羅網般的愛之温柔；是知識份子無原則的空談生活。疏忽或懈怠，很明顯而容易的，我不被貧病毁滅，將必壓碎在時代的輪下。</p>
<p>隱藏在生活上的細微弱點和無智，不批判，不克服，在某個時間上，必發展成爲墜落的原因。不錯吧，假如現實的威脅，在我心底不自覺的泛　的話，引誘和沉迷，便乘虚而進；我的生活的結論是甚麽呢？這是何等可怕呵</p>
<p>從前日到昨日，從昨日到今日，多少人物的殁落和興起的歷史，不能視爲偶然，正是我們生活的鏡子，眞理是：不進則退，没有停留的東西。智慧與感情，應該由忠實而健全的生活，和堅實的知識來擴大的吧。</p>
<p>從澈底洞悉婦女的一員的自身與社會；歷史的辯證法的熱練，藝術與科學的親切和熟悉，必須是我今年生活的軌道</p>
<p>（嚴肅的生活，建立生活於堅實的知識基礎之上！）我這様頌祝我的一九三五年的開始。</p>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>寒風一陣陣，把二十三年的陳腐，都吹送掉了。</p>
<p>新年舞動着努力的標幟，歌着前進曲，從擠擠擁擁的羣衆中走出來。</p>
<p>新年，這可歌可頌，歡欣鼓舞着的新年，她孕育着春之融光生之力！這力，是推動大地一切一切的原動力。啊，新年，她將推動着這大地，朝向光明的大路走！輾過那汚濁的阡陌，走上那平坦的大道！</p>
<p>新年，她更要推動那大地的婦女們，把她們推向廣闊的社會上來。讓她們把家庭裹的事，展開成社會的事；簡單化，專門化。組織兒童公育，公共食堂，縫織洗染公司······等。各人盡自已的能力之所能，從事各人所本意的工作；貢獻整個自已給人類，爲整個人類而服務</p>
<p>婦女們，拿你的至高的愛，愛大衆，不要只愛你的丈夫和兒子！把你那絶頂的能，爲大衆犠牲；不要僅爲你的愛人犠牲了你寳貴的心身！</p>
<p>因爲我是一個婦女，我希望婦女們在新年推動着時代的輪之際，一齊鼓噪着前進！</p>
<p>希望於婦女們的心，也就是希望於我自已的。從此：我要脫下這覊束我行動的綢長袍，摔開這妨碍我邁步的尖頭高跟鞋，剪掉這尺餘長曲折不直率的煩惱髮，洗盡這汚穢我純潔的皮膚的脂粉呢。赤裸裸地做一個一九三五年的新婦女新我！</p>
<p>— 濮舜卿</p>
<p>我是個研究法律，現在職行着律師事務，同時也是個文學的愛好者，在這廿四年元旦的清晨，我計劃了一下我今年應做的事：現在槪括地寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）在今年内至少細讀十部法學和文學的名著以充實工作的工具。</p>
<p>（二）在今年内編成兩部法學書和兩本戲劇。（因爲我雖則是一個研究法律的人，同時也愛好戲劇。）</p>
<p>（三）在我律師的職務上，多多地帮助被壓迫的婦女，挽回她們法律上應得的權利。</p>
<p>（四）去年我和我的朋友陳韻　律師計劃着在事務所裹附設一個婦女義務法律顧問部，爲經濟困難的婦女，解决法律上疑難的問題，希望今年能够實行。</p>
<p>（五）在今年内，我願意帮助一千個婦女得到她們應有的法律常識。</p>
<p>上面這個簡單的工作計劃，我希望不打折扣地實行，庶不辜負今年的我。現在寫了出來，用以警惕自已，並且懇求愛我的朋友，加以策勵！</p>
<p>二十四年元旦於上海</p>
<p>— 養愚</p>
<p>人類一切的活動，離不了由個人或社會出發，個人生活得安定，才能談得到社會的努力；所以今年的我，先决問題，仍是得計算這一年的生計，同時自我個人的處世態度和做人的方針，也得確定一下。回憶離開學校生活五年的我，踏進這五花八門的社會，學校教職員當過，編輯做過，可是五年的經騐，社會給我的教訓，就是我太不了解社會，不能適應社會了，拿着十餘年書本上得來做人的理論，來和社會周旋，這實是不合現社會生存之道。人家在高唱人格救國，秉公無私，架子排得又硬又正，那知這只是上面對於下面，大人物對於小人物的一種手段，而我呢，毫没有透澈這種眞理，一味硬幹，直幹，痴幹，結果就與社會相離日遠了。談到什麽運動呢，人家的牌子掛得又高又久，開會演說，做文章，談解放，閙得振天價嚮，而我呢，没有了解這才是爲自已造地位的塲合，對於這種周遭，我事前旣不知取巧，也不懹疑，如是人就認我是笨是戇。今年的我，走路的方向，應取怎様的態度，這問題在新年的前夕，熟思了一回，最後决定了，今年做人的動向，仍是要走笨路，第一是堅固個人的人格，保持獨立的精神，要能在社會裹，打進打出，無論吃虧，吃苦，上當，一切不顧，努力掙扎。第二是小我之外，不忘大我，我之爲我，不能在大我中表現人格，貫澈主張，那我的奮鬥，不會是毫没意義嗎，我的同志督促我和她繼續着我們的事業，擴大我們的組織女聲社，這實是我今年計劃中的要圖，只要社會給一綫光明之路，使我這笨人有努力的機會，今年的我在這三百六十五日中才不算虚過去</p>
<p>— 朱永麗</p>
<p>我是一個十六歲的女孩子。我從湖南到上海那一年，正碰着日本開兵打我們，因此我的父親便失業了。以後一家人的生活弄得没辦法，我就被人介紹到一個紗廠做工，做了三個多月，只拿到了兩元的工資，我就不做了。又被人介紹到一個工廠做工，這個工廠的工資雖然很小，但工作很輕，時間也不多，於是我在晚上父親教我讀書，白天做工，這様一面貼補家庭的生活，一直繼續到現在。</p>
<p>我知道我們一個青年，一面要維持生命，一面要獲得知識，所以我從今年起，還是繼續我過去的計畫，一面做工，一面讀書，自然，除了這以外也没有更好的辦法。但是我知道讀書不光是認識幾個字，要了解我們本身的問題；因爲我是一個青年，而那些摩敦小姐也是一個青年，何以她們有機會進學校：不和我同様的青年女子在中國現在不知有多少，何以她們都没有機會進學校，而只有少數的摩敦小姐能進學校？</p>
<h3>編後</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>歡迎新年的，雖然依舊是舊年人，但誰也會在此年頭歲首，有所計劃，有所憧憬。爲要窺取（婦園）的讀者與播種者的個人期望，這是出這專號的動機。</p>
<p>個人，本是社會成員之一，個人的動態，卽是社會事態一角的表現。雖限於篇幅，不能盡量登載，但由此，已可涸察一部分知識婦女的冀希。</p>
<p>這裹有的將鵬飛萬里，訪問世界，有的誓詞埋頭苦幹，謀求解放婦女羣，更有的是貧病重壓下的悲憤呼聲！</p>
<p>在此寒氣瑟瑟的更深長夜，吟味着這些積極的抗爭策，消極的悲鳴聲，給與了我莫大的剌激與鼓勵。回問自已（今年的我）呢。啊！我嗎？我將抛棄其餘的繁雜工作，盡全力來開拓園地，建設園地，聯合播種人，推動解放輪！！！</p>

<h3>紗花紗廠又傅停工標紗疲而復振</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、形勢依然暗澹之局、但現紗銷路益覺沉悶、因銀根緊急之故、客帮進胃較滯、惟通成通濟兩公司之多額、安然不動、午後市塲上傅說、某紗廠已停工、故收盤時遠月趨漲而昂云、</p>
<p>金鷄近跌遠漲標紗前市開盤、以美棉平平、印棉回落、而金價仍軟、塲中買者凋零、市情異常渙散、惟多頭公司毫無舉動、結果各月均跌四五六七角、午後開盤繼續衰弱、拍至二三盤、突然薄漲、多說有數紗廠實行停工、故買風稍起、惟本月平平、遠月趨堅、回漲二五七角、查賣出瑞大三百五十包、大豐一千二百五十包、明德一千三百五十包、昶記三百包、遠大五百包、仁豐五百五十包、恒昌六百五十包、德記三百包、愼記四百包、買進裕康七百包、源大六百包、恒德一千六百五十包、愼記四百包、元一六百五十包、賡豐二千三百包、一日間最高低價吸收盤價列下、標紗最高價最低價收盤價漲跌存賬數一月期一八四·○一八三·六一八三·跌○·六○四○、九○○二月期一八五·○一八四·七一八五·○○·四○四六、四○○三月期一八六·九一八六·三一八六·六○·五○五四、四五○四月期一八八·二一八七·○一八八·二漲○·一○五二、五五○五月期一八八·八一八八·三一八八·八二九、五○○六月期一八九·六一八八·八一八九·六○·三○一、一○○總計二二四、九○○</p>

<p>鄭標跌落一二角標花前市開盤、因印棉反動、轉跌三·四羅比、而金價仍跌、匯兌放長、西北存花充足、多數尚未輸出、近以銀根日緊、市價鬆動、故買者較少、各月均跌五分一角至一角半、午後開盤有空頭抵補、略形回堅、但拍至二三盤、市上傅言極盛、謂有數廠實行停工說、故市氣尤弱、各月又跌五分、惟遠月稍堅漲五分、查賣出裕大八百擔、大豐八百擔、仁豐一千擔、長豐一千一百擔、益康八百擔、長和一千九百擔、信誠九百擔、買進源大二千三百擔、賡豐二千三百擔、恒德一千五百擔、長豐一千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、標花最高價最低價收盤價漲跌存賬數一月期三六·六五三六·五○三六·五跌○·一五一二六、二○○二月期三七·二○三七·○五三七·○五○·一五一六○、六○○三月期三七·七五三七·六五三七·七○○·一○一六三、一○○四月期三七·九五三七·九○三七·九○○·二○一三五、七○○五月期三八·二五三八·一五三八·二五○·○五八四、八○○六月期三八·四○三八·三○三八·四○○·一○四、四○○總計六七四、八○○</p>

<h3>糧食粉麥大跌小回頭</h3>
<p>粉市昨日上午開盤後、先疲後穩、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大等處、好四分至八分左右、當開盤時、以前日之大跌、業内外人心、不免觀望、本月份開價低至四角七分七厘半、惟拍至遠期、因廠家之套頭已經停手、現麥之兜售、亦無所聞、人心一定、喊價遂見步穩、兼之市塲浮空之抵補、市氣遂愈益穩固也、迨至下午開盤、本月份因有掉期交易、市氣見緊、遠期業外大户續行收進、故廠家雖有出檔、人心仍然俏利、查洋麥籌碼、較之往年、祇及十分之一二、後步如無續定、當仍看定勢也、結果本月份好二厘半、二月份好一分半、三月份好一分二厘半、四月份好一分半、五月份好一分七厘半、六月份好二分七厘半云、</p>
<p>麥市大致平定、以洋麥報價、祇好四八分左右、當開價後、本月份因現貨稀薄、人心甚穩、遠期因出户不暢、市氣轉定、各盤交易、尚見活絡、價則呈盤旋也、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、又入清淡、本月份因現麥未豐、行家略有收進、價好一二分、遠期則做開甚少、上落無幾、結果本月份爲二分、二月份好一分、三月份好三分、餘未聞、現麥因廠胃未動、全日未開云、</p>

<h3>一年來之中國歌舞</h3>
<p>— 馮詠棠</p>
<p>（一）歌舞的（生意眼）槪談</p>
<p>在過去二三年間，中國歌舞界就已踏上了没落的途程。大腿酥胸已是不易賣錢了，淫歌艶舞亦已將近失去號召的能力。歌舞班到各地營業，大都慘敗而歸。歌舞班主若是有錢的大少爺們還賠得起本錢，若是一些走江湖的（藝人）們，則在營業失敗之後，就連一些（行頭）也都要保不住了。歌舞班的這種處境，到現在並没有改過多少。今年的歌舞界，一般的說，仍是籠罩在不景氣的氛圍裹。幾個著名的歌舞班，在不多的幾次表演裹，都不曾賺到多少錢。我現在不妨把上海的幾次歌舞表演約略的提一提。</p>
<p>首先我要說到梅花團。（梅花團）在歌舞界中是大家熟知的一個名字。在前二年，梅花是同様的窮困不堪，不過自從在南洋新加坡等處兜了一個圈子回來後，班主已住進了洋房，坐上了汽車了。（在南洋，歌舞尚屬所鮮，梅花團這一次的能賣錢，就是因爲僑胞看大腿還看得少的緣故。但今年（上海技術歌舞團）到南洋去，情形就有點不同了。）今年梅花也曾舉行過幾次表演，但營業情形都不見十分好。五月間在金城大戲院表演所謂（一九三四年式的歌舞），廣告大吹大擂着說：（麗姝滿目，媚態萬千，　　　　　　聲　　一度欣賞，三月不知肉味，欲探梅心，此其時矣！）種種香詞艶句，已足把人嚇倒，有藝術素養的人誰還敢去領教呢？這次的（壓柱戲）是（戀愛學堂），一幕空想的可笑的歌舞劇，也並没有怎末引起人們注意。七月底，繼新華歌劇社之後，梅花團又在新光演出。這次的演期相當的長，從七月二十七日起到八月十三日止，共演了十八天，節目曾數數更換。觀客雖也不少，但並不十分踴躍，營業也不見十分發逹。所以能够演這末些日子，那是另有原因的，原來在暑期裹影戲院營業大都清淡，那時新光正擬）歇夏），旣然歌舞尚能號召一部分色情的觀衆，有錢可賺，多維持幾天也没有什麽不可。梅花這次表演，無論就人才或節目方面說，比在金城的一次規模都要大些，我爲了要使大家多明瞭一些歌舞情形起見，想把牠來好好的介紹一番。這次登台的演員，除了（領銜）的一熱女郎）徐粲鶑小姐之外，尚有張綺　張仙琳，蔡一鳴，范里香，潘文霞，潘文娟，錢鍾秀，賈秋雲，翁蘭雪等幾位，所謂（五虎將，四金鋼）之類，就有她們在内了。節目方面，有（最新偉構）的（一塲春夢），有（精妙絶倫）的（玩弄），有（富麗香艶）的（楊貴妃），（璇宮艶史），有（風趣刺激）的（後台），有（不朽）的（七情），這些都是壓柱戲，陸續搬出，梅花可謂出　底貨　　世界，若一娟娟舞一娉婷舞）（浪舞）（玉兎舞）（草裙艶舞）（爪哇姑娘）（黑白舞）（西班牙舞）（却爾斯登舞）（蹕躂舞）（麗亞舞）（鶼鍱舞）（鏗鏘舞）水手舞）······若（夜來香）（春色滿園）（花團錦簇）（花開爲着你）（愛之果）（春宵曲）（蝶影翩　）（我不能忘記你）（遊龍戲鳳）（情伴）（新毛毛雨）（雙宿雙飛）（青春之樂）（追求）（夜花園裹）粉白黛綠）（嫁給勇士吧）······這些，或爲舞，或爲歌，或爲劇，都無不香艶，無不迷人，單是聽到這些名字也就够香艶够迷人的了！</p>
<p>不久前，梅花在本埠的小戲院裹還有過演出，但這始終不曾引起人們注意過，規模也很小，這裹擬不再提到牠了。</p>
<p>新華歌劇社在七月二十到二十三日這幾天中也舉行過一次所謂（有史以來第一次最偉大之歌舞表演），還拉了許多女明星（客串），當時盛况可以想見。論人才，若袁美雲，黎莉莉，白虹，胡笳，黎明健，倉隱秋，江蔓莉等幾位小姐，都不能不說是很有才能，若能得到好的指導，她們在（歌）（舞）方面的確可以有爲。新華社的徐健，虞華，葉英，歐陽斐莉諸位也都是聰明的姑娘，都很有前途：可惜的是，她們都不曾珍視自已的這種才能，没有向新的唱歌，新的舞蹈方面走去，這不免是一種損失。譬如這一次新華的公演，就缺乏新的貨色，節目大都是從明月社承襲過來的遺渣。什麽（天鵝舞），（銀漢舞），（泡泡舞）······什麽（愛的花），（夜來香），（四個安琪兒），（健美運動），（公平交易），（風雨歸舟），（摩登戀愛），（求愛秘訣），（劍鋒之下），（特别快車）等，我們都不能予以過高的評價，雖然這其中如兒童歌舞劇（特别快車）等，比較的還値得一看。自然，這次是比較能賣座的。</p>
<p>和梅花在新光表演同時（八月初），新華和（東方羅克）邵莊林（領導）的羣艶歌舞社又聯合着在虹口廣東大戲院表演。這一次雖添了幾個新人，但節目還是半斤八兩的那一套，營業方面也至爲平常，這裹也擬不再去申說牠了。此外還有一些小歌舞團，如（銀花）（明明）（華光）（桃花）（集美）（冷燕）等，或是在大世界等游藝塲，本埠二三等戲院裹賣藝，或是開到外埠去流浪一時，都没有什麽起色的，這裹也不須去說牠了。總之，歌舞界目前若不另闢途徑，他們勢不能衝破當前不景氣的氛圍而有所成就的。</p>
<p>（二）歌舞的影界進出</p>
<p>歌舞的不大有出路，已是一件鮮明的事實，毋庸諱言。歌舞界爲了自已的前途而跑到電影界和播音界去潛植勢力，乃是應有的結果。關於歌舞界在播音方面的活動這裹暫且不去說牠；在電影方面，自美國華納公司的（四十二　　等幾部歌舞片賣錢後，接着國産歌舞片（人間仙子）也稍能賣錢，於是歌舞界中人有的就自已組織影片公司，開攝影片，有的就加入影片公司，變成明星。例如梅花團中有一部分人就另外組織了一個梅花影片公司，開攝（薔薇之歌），還閙了一次弄巧成拙的宣傅的笑話。原來該片主角潘文霞本無藉藉名，爲引人注意起見，主持人就佈置了一塲假官司，出賞格，閙得滿城風雨，婦孺皆知。此外如明月社，新華社，梅花團中人也都有不少走上銀幕了。明月社的白虹，黎明健，已在（人間仙子）中演出，茵英在（健美運動）中演出；梅花團除潘文霞外，潘文娟，徐粲鶑，范里香，都曾派在影片中担任要角。新華社的許多社員都曾在天一本年度的幾張影片中作過配角及活動皆景，梅花團老板黃　還有一種配置有聲機械隨團體開到外洋去隨時拍片的計劃，現正在進行中。</p>
<p>歌舞的這様向影界躍進原不自今日始，在三四年前，王人美，黎莉莉，胡笳等就已跳上了銀幕，再早還有黎明暉，但那時並非表演歌舞片罷了。今後國産歌舞片也許會形成一個潮流的，不過這也要看内容和技術特别是技術如何而定。没有好萊塢那様龐大的資本，一些粗製濫造的東西，要希望能像（四十二號）之類一様能賣錢，恐怕是不會有的事吧？觀衆是只能欺騙一次的。由這方面看來，中國歌舞片的前途，也至爲暗淡。</p>
<p>（三）也是一件大事</p>
<p>說到這裹，我又記起了一件有趣的事。大家大槪都還記得今年夏季大晚報上歌星競選的事吧，這裹我就要談到牠。這次選舉，前後共化了一個多月的時間，投票者可稱甚爲踴躍。每週選票揭曉，以明月社之白虹，新華社之周璇二人得票最多。結果白虹以九千一百零三票當選第一，周璇以八千八百七十六票當選第二，汪曼傑以八千八百五十四票當選第三，這三人就是我們現在所熟知的（三大歌星）。這些平常不大引起人們注意的小姑娘，居然有成萬的人擁護她們，這眞是有點可異，但這也許眞是因爲她們歌唱得好的緣故吧？我得承認，她們的歌喉都頗有希望：但我以爲她們不一定都眞的懂得音樂。會經在什麽地方看到有人諷刺（三大歌星）過，說是在康腦脫路徐園舉行的某一次游藝會裹，有（三大歌星）之一的英文歌獨唱的節目，在座有兩位碧眼先生，一聽見唱歌就從坐位上站起走了。這怕不是因爲那兩位洋先生不懂得英文歌的緣故吧？無疑地這是她們對歌唱的不够理解。她們應當更深一層的去研究，切不可把一些目前流行的庸俗的摩登歌樂視爲至寳，因爲這些東西，在音樂上都是没有什麽高的價値的（她們跳的舞也一様的没有多少價値）</p>
<p>（四）餘話</p>
<p>說到這裹，我不能不補充一點關於中國新歌舞的前途的話。歌，舞，歌舞劇，無疑地都是必需的，但决不是中國目前的歌舞所能充數。我們需要新的内容與形式的歌舞。我們不需要出賣大腿酥胸，出賣肉感的歌舞。一切淫詞艶曲，妖形怪態，都是麻醉戕賊青年的毒劑，在眞正的歌舞中，應該没有地位，應該被摒除的。眞正的歌舞裹應當不只是模仿了一點外洋爵士音樂的皮毛，一點外洋妖蕩的舞姿就够了，牠應當有更高級的音樂基礎，更複雜的旋律的配合，更有力的並具有體態之美而又能代表一個民族性的，和集體形式的跳舞姿態才行。希望在歌舞方面努力的人，從這别一個方向，來改進或創造中國新的歌舞！</p>

<h3>一年來之中國電影</h3>
<p>— 夏貞德女士</p>
<p>今年電影界的事情特别多，在這短短的篇幅裹勢不能加以詳細的結算。現在我只想就其中重要方面及其犖犖大者的幾點，加以簡要的叙述。</p>
<p>（一）影業槪况隨着世界不景氣的浪潮，一年來中國影業已逐漸走上了衰落的尖端。不論是電影公司或影戲院的營業方面，大都步入了掙扎的境地。我們不妨先從電影公司說起。中國電影事業薈萃在上海，明星，聯華，天一，藝華是上海不，是中國電影業的巨擘，這是我們所知道的。這幾家公司的營業狀况，向來都是保守秘密而不曾對外發表過，但我們從影片賣座上推測，也是可得知其大槪的。明星自本年度（妹姊花）賣座後，公司顯得活躍些，在四月一日成立了一個（復興同志會），籌劃復興，還債。但本年度明星其他的片子，如（二對一）（女性的仇敵）（青春綫）（黃金穀）等，營業上就差些，後來雖有全班人馬合作的（女兒經）及技術欠佳的（麥夫人）相當賣座而得以補救不少，但離復興之道尚逹。聯華本年度的（漁光曲），營業上自然獲得了最大的成功，但别的片子如（光明之路）（鐵鳥）（黑心符）（南洋大觀）（青春）等賣座都不見十分佳。天一因爲多攝有聲片，很少有人與之競爭，營業上尚能支持，但這一半也由於經營者的聰明，例如在最短期間内用最小的開支來攝製一部片子的事是有過的。藝華是後起之秀，直到現在還只出過（中國海的怒潮）（烈焰）（黃金時代）（女人）（人間仙子）（飛花村）六部片子，但資本相當堅實，（女人）（人間仙子）又稍能賣座，不景氣的氛圍或者較薄。</p>
<p>但整個中國電影業目前仍然是在掙扎的狀態中。一般的都採用緊縮政策，而欠薪不發也都是普遍的事實。在出品數量上也是一步步的减少；偷工减料粗製濫造的風氣也到處流行。</p>
<p>目前，電影公司營業地盤之一天天的狹小，也已到了無法挽救的境地。從前國外最佳的市塲，是南洋荷英屬地及暹羅，安南，菲律賓等處，而現在各該地不影氣程度日深，華僑生計日迫，自然，影片的營業要一落千丈了。在内地，影戲院受了社會經濟日趨窮困及苛捐雜稅的影響，因購不起影片而關門停業的也時有所聞。這裹我不妨插寫一點影戲院營業的槪况。現在内地各城市影戲院大都向關門停閉的路上走了，如成都，五家影院就有三家在本年十一月關了門，其餘兩家則因積欠省市醫藥捐在十二月被市當局勒令停業。漢口影院六家除（世界一家尚能勉强維持外，其餘倒的倒，未倒的也如風前之燭了。廣州影院担負了五種捐稅：戲餉，娛樂捐，娛樂印花，廣告捐，營業稅，因不堪担負，有全部停業的危機。卽如遍地黃金的上海，影院營業也不大景氣，有一輪戲院降而爲二輪的，有以專映權定期包與電影公司的，至於内部極力緊縮，和想法節省廣告費等，也都在影院老板的算盤内。在這様的塲合，電影公司的市塲那得不一天天狹小？還有，自東北四省變色以來，廣大的電影銷塲已非我所有，就是在戰區及其附近地帶，人民也鮮有餘裕來找尋娛樂了，這様，電影營業又焉得不一落千丈？</p>
<p>由於這種關係，電影公司在製片方針上就不得不有一番更張。在題材的剪取上，小市民生活的苦况的描寫，現實的有力的揭露，將成爲一種爭取交化上營業上勝利的方法，將成爲進步的從業員們努力的目標。另一方面，偷工减料粗製濫造的方法，必然地更要推陳出新，别翻花様；以全體演員出塲的新片將必流行；種種新奇的節省經濟的方法也必將被製片商採用這雖表現着他們在苦悶中的掙扎，但這却也正是他們踏上了自召滅亡的的路途。</p>
<p>（二）新片一瞥本年度聯華有九部出品，明星有二十一部，天一有十三部，藝華有六部，電通有一部。此外，小公司如大長城，友聯，天馬，天北，良友，快活林，大光明，曁南，華倫，集美，也大都有一兩部作品。在這不到百部的作品中，佳片自然也有幾部，但粗製濫造的低劣作品至少要超過佳片的數目一倍以上。小公司的作品，常要模仿人家賣座的片子，這其中自然也有模仿得好的，但一般的說，因爲限於人力和財力，他們的努力常不易得到優美的收獲。最不妥的是他們中有一部分人關起門來秘密攝製武俠神怪片的這件事。這且不必去提他。至於各大公司的片子，我們也不必一張張的去說到，現在我只想把幾張曾引起過一般社會注意的片子約略的提一提。首先我要說到的是（姊妹花）。（姊妹花）是一部連映兩月之久打破世界賣座紀錄的片子，自然，她是有能滿足觀衆要求的所在的。這是一部（苦戲），没有（愛情），（没有（肉感），其所以能使觀衆感動的原因，乃在於牠能使小市民觀衆的苦悶情緒得以有個發洩的機會，在於牠的諷刺現實，在於牠粉飾了一點前進的意識。實際，這個作品並没有高度的技術完成，導演表演都部分的文明戲化，而這一點就是製作人自已也承認的。</p>
<p>（漁光曲）連映了八十多天，要算是本年度最哄動的一張片子。這同様是一個（苦戲）。牠是苦悶的小市民們眼涙的泉源，是他們發洩胸中積鬰的一副清凉劑。作者的改良的觀點，雖未能使觀衆得到多少健康的感受，但作者在技術上的修養，却也能使觀衆滿意而歸。</p>
<p>此外，聯華的（人生）（風）（香雪海）（再會吧上海），明星的（鹽潮）（路柳墻花）（女兒經）（上海廿四小時）（再生花），天一的（王先生）（百花洲），藝華的（中國海的怒潮）（烈燄）（女人）（人間仙子），電通的（桃李刦）等，雖都曾引起過一般社會的注意，但這些影片尚不能說是我們在一九三四年的優美收獲：因爲這些影片和歐美電影業的巨量生産及其高度的技術完成相較，實在還是小巫見大巫，渺小不足道的。</p>
<p>（三）幾種製片新傾向中國電影業本來還很幼稚，但中國電影却也並非没有希望。例如近二三年來，中國電影的進步就是誰也不能否認的。中國電影若能照近年來的情勢發展下去，自然不會没有他的前途。不過最近中國電影界確有很多使人不能不失望的地方。中國電影界已漸步入了錯誤的途上去了。由於美國歌舞片（四十二號街）（歌舞昇平）（華清春暖）（奇異酒店）的哄動，中國少數製片家也在東施效顰，開始賣弄肉感了。繼（人間仙子）之後，我們有（健美運動）（國色天香）（薔薇之歌）等片的攝製，這無疑對於中國新生電影是有害的，中國電影實没有再踏入到美國式的淫靡糜爛的漩渦裹去的必要。其次，滑稽影片，因（王先生）的能賣錢，眼紅的人接着就搬出了（好好先生）（酒色財氣）（航空救國）等，（王先生的秘密）也正臨床待産，將來也許還有新的花様翻了出來。但我們要知道喜劇電影是極不易製作的，目前的庸俗無聊投機取巧的滑稽片實在不是電影，而是糟蹋了電影。還有，鴛鴦蝴蝶影片目前也有再抬頭的傾向。天一的（歡喜寃家）（似水流年）等片都是這一類型的作品，現在且有某幾家影片公司把擱置已久的這類影片劇本重新拿出來開拍的消息。這實在是開倒車的不智行爲，因爲這類影片的不能賣錢，早已有鐵的事實證明的了。</p>
<p>（四）影刋的蓬勃今年電影刋物的出版可謂風靡一時，上海各大日報幾乎没有一家不設電影附刋或登電影文字的。民報（影譚），中華日報（銀座）等，都是今年新開闢的（銀地）。此外，申報（電影專刋），新聞報（藝海），晨報（每日電影），時事新報新上海電影欄，時報電影版，上海商報（銀總會）等，都是專登電影文字的。晚報若大晚報之（剪影），（星期電影），大美晚報之（銀花），（影戲周刋），時報之（影刋）（周刋），新聞夜報之（電影周刋），新夜報之（黑眼睛）（後改爲（銀本位），社會晚報之（電影號）等，大都是各該報的電影附刋。單行本的電影刋物也風起雲湧，今年我們所看到的，月刋方面有（電影畫報）（時代電影）（現代電影）（青青電影）（戲劇與電影）等，周刋方面有（影迷周報）（電聲）（影畫）等，半月刋有（電影世界）等，這些都多少帮助擴大了電影文化的陣勢。畫報中的電影頁，也頗能引起人們的興趣，今年各畫報如（良友）（最近期出有（電影專刋）），（時代），（美術生活），（大上海），（中華），（文華），（大衆），（新潮）及硬性的（中華月報）等，都很注意電影照片的刋登，以助人們茶餘酒後的消遣。各小報也大都刋載電影文字以爲號召，但多數都不過記載一些導演明星們的起居注，或替影片公司宣傅一下，或駡駡人，没有多大價値，不過看一看却也未嘗不好的。總之電影是被廣大的觀衆所注意的了，各種刋物若不登電影文字或圖片，便要失却一部分的號召力。這無怪電影刋物的流行已成爲近來的一種風尚和趨勢了。</p>
<p>（五）影評及其前途現在要說到電影批評了。今年影評人間風浪疊興，從軟硬性之爭執起，到僞專家的發現止，中經大小不知若干戰，直到目前，餘波猶未息。這原因自然是因爲時勢的推移，而劃了思想分歧的鴻溝。論爭原是必不可免而非常必要的。而這種論爭的確也帮助了新的電影批評。影評的現實主義及影評基凖問題在論爭中不斷的提出，恰好揭露着一些抺煞内容的（技術批評），一些近乎替影院宣傅的（記錄）的或說好就上天的所謂（批評）的面目。不過因此却也召致了少數影片公司的嫉視，嗾使着宣傅員們喊出（不要電影批評）的口號，來企圖打撃電影批評。其計雖未售，但影評人却因此而愈益奮發精神，在影評行文時的親切態度上，在影評文字的大衆化上，都極力開拓着影評的新的有益的前途。</p>
<p>此外，本年度的大小事尚多，如南京首都戲院的剪去（女兒經），復（强姦）各報影刋的事件，如外資在華攝片（外資在華製片的有浦東的中外影片公司，江灣的中國製片公司等）事件，如米高梅華實地攝製（大地）事件，如哄動一時的薛袁（誘姦案），洪鶯的（自白）事件，以及艾霞自殺，王瑩出國，下至於一般電影明星們生活的清苦，電影公司的開倒車······寫也寫不盡，說也說不完，就此帶住吧。</p>
<h3>下期預告</h3>
<p>— （雉）</p>
<p>本刋新年特刋擬出至下期爲止。下期要目可預告者有（一）一年來之中國書業，（二）一年來之中國出版界，及（三）一年來之中國教育；前兩篇指出一年來中國出版事業之特徵與其傾向，後一篇對於民族教育之重要性頗多發揮。希讀者諸君注意。</p>
<h3>一年來之中國音樂</h3>
<p>— 王逹平</p>
<p>一年來的中國音樂，從某一方面看來，是有着牠的顯著的進步，但從另一方面看來，却也顯示着牠的不可挽救的墮落。這一年來音樂方面的事情倒很多，現在我就把那些顯得進步和退步的地方，提出來說一說吧。</p>
<p>一，音樂在電影</p>
<p>音樂在牠本身的領域内本年度値得提出來的事情並不多，要說牠本年内有多少進步，那是牠在電影方面的運用。有聲片較無聲片更能賣座這一事實是我們所知道的，但聲片中歌曲與配音，甚至音響，都與音樂不能分開，在這種塲合音樂無疑就是聲片的靈魂。本年度國産聲片中的音樂（歌唱），除（姊妹花）（桃李刦）等裹面的幾支歌以外，大都不曾引起人注意過。這自然是因爲歌曲内容和技術欠佳的關係。迨默片（漁光曲）中的漁光曲一出，情形乃立變，其哄動的影響甚至形成了後來的影片要配上音樂才能够賣座的一個潮流。（漁光曲）的成名，雖然作曲者安娥女士說這只是一種（偶然的僥倖），但實際上這支歌内容的現實，節調的哀愁，曲譜的組織化，以及牠的配合着影片的現實題材等，都是使牠哄動的理由。（漁光曲）以後，我們隔了好久，直到最近才又聽到了（桃李刦）的（畢業歌），（大路）的（大路歌）開路先鋒歌）（鳳陽歌）（燕燕歌），（飛花村）之（飛花歌）（牧羊歌）等，其中尤以（大路歌）（開路先鋒歌）的剛健新頴雄烈悲壯爲難得。這些膾炙人口的歌曲，應該是一九三四年中國音樂界不可多得的出産。</p>
<p>此外，尚有明星公司和天一公司的幾張對白歌唱片如（再生花）（紉珠）（紅樓春深）（春宵曲）（歌台艶史）······等都有些歌曲在裹面，但這些在音樂上是不曾引起注意，也没有多少影響的。</p>
<p>二音樂在播音</p>
<p>播音假設没有音樂，那播音怕就很難引起人們注意，也很難收到效果的罷。聽衆大槪都不願意聽教育節目（如教授國語，國學，英語，中小學教材等）的，原因是這種材料旣很枯燥，而又没有配上音樂的緣故。話劇播音假設没有好的配音，也不易得到效果。音樂在播音中地位之重要可以想見一斑了。</p>
<p>目前的音樂播音，簡直可以說是淺薄，幼稚，没有多少價値。現在在播音界最紅的是彈詞家，申曲家，歌唱女郎等，他們播唱的東西，旣陳舊而又有害，要想從他們那裹聽到一些有價値的東西，那是萬萬辦不到的。特别是一些播音小姐們，她們只會唱幾支肉麻的時行歌曲，她們旣不懂得（聲樂），嗓音也儘有着很多的缺點。她們有的甚至連（韻律）和（拍子）都不懂，别的那就更不消</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>說了。在這様的狀態之下，音樂這東西在播音界是早已不復存在的了。</p>
<p>那些高踞在學府裹的專家們，今年也有走到播音台裹面去的。國立音樂專科學校的學生們，今年上半年每月總要在中西藥房播音台廣播一次音樂節目的，從本年十月第一週起至一九三五年六月第一週止，更規定爲每週播送音樂一次，時間定於每星期五晚八時至八時四十五分舉行。節目方面有演講，紀念節目，音樂教材，民歌，藝術歌，淺近藝術器樂曲，藝術曲，本國舊樂，新創作等十種。但這些節目在那許多千奇百怪的播音節目中，實在也難於引起人們的注意。</p>
<p>工部局管絃樂隊現在也舉行播音的。播音地點在西人ＸＯＨＡ電臺，時間爲每尾期二晚九時至十時，星期五晚八時半至九時半。</p>
<p>此外，有些電影歌曲如（漁光曲）（姊妹花）等，也播唱得很多，特别是（漁光曲），通過各播音臺的播送，現在幾乎已成爲家喻户曉的了。而這一點却可以說是比較可人意的一件事。</p>
<p>三，音樂演奏會</p>
<p>音樂演奏會在音樂專科學校裹時有舉行，在社會上也可以不斷的碰得到。暑天裹工部局樂隊時常要在本埠各公園裹舉行演奏，音樂專家們也間或有開音樂演奏會的，别處學校裹的學生們，也間或有到本埠來開演奏會的。工部局交響樂隊在本埠素來很有名，每年要舉行幾届音樂季，最近的一次是從十月二十一日起，地點在法租界蘭心大戲院，時間在星期日晚間。十一月底大上海開映描寫十九世紀大音樂家休勃德氏情史的（想思曲）（ＬＯＶＥＴＩＭＥ）時，該隊也曾蒞塲演奏過的。音樂學校的演奏會，音專開的很多，規模比較大的是十一月二十六日該校七周紀念的音樂會，地點在北四川路新亞酒店七樓大禮堂，演奏時間亘四小時之久，可見其節目豐富之一斑。不過這次演奏會中，鋼琴合奏和廖君的小提琴獨奏是特别失敗了的。這次演奏會中很引人注意的是俄國作曲家ＴＣＨＥＲＥＰＩＮＯ氏徵求有中國風味的鋼琴曲給獎的一件事。頭獎作者賀綠汀君，其作品名（牧童之笛），當時他曾親自彈了一次，頗得Ｔ氏稱許。本年十二月裹該校又舉行一次師生作品演奏會，這次演奏會同様有缺點，但好的演奏也還算多。從這次演奏會中可以看出該校的音樂家們是在努力着中西音樂的混合和調和的工作。國樂合奏，也常是該校演奏會的一個節目。這可見該校努力傾向的一斑了。</p>
<p>還有不得不提起的，就是那在社會上相當有名的大同樂會，在八月二十七日孔誔紀念中舉行國樂演奏的這件事。據專家的批評，這次的演奏是完全失敗了所奏的（中和韶樂）未能得到聽衆的感應。這原因得歸之於演奏技術的未臻熟練，樂器的欠佳，樂曲本身的没有音樂價値（這（中和韶樂）的全樂曲只是一個簡單的曲調而無和聲）這幾點。</p>
<p>最後，我還得把十月間百代公司的（新聲會）第一次的唱片試聽提一提。這是灌音片的試聽而不是演奏會，但我取其類似之處，不想另立標題，就只好在這裹談到牠。這次聽到的幾個歌曲是（大路歌）（開路先鋒歌）（畢業歌）和新歌劇（提子江暴風雨）中的歌曲。這些歌曲我們現在都能聽到，牠給予我們的感覺和一些流行的歌曲大不相同，這裹没有（靡靡之音），有的却僅是雄勁和壯健。歌詞和曲調，不論是在内容上和形式上都配合得很爲恰當，决非一班善於抄襲者所能辦得到的。</p>
<p>四，音樂出版界</p>
<p>一年來音樂出版物在量的方面並不怎様豐富，質的方面更是貧乏得可憐。電影公司爲廣宣傅計，曾在影片開映時贈送該片歌曲，不但直接贈送觀客，也利用書店等機關贈送社會人士的。但這並不能說中國音樂出版界有什麽生氣，實際這只不過是影片公司戲院老板的（生意眼）而已。中國最多産最有影響（這影響是好是壤，容待後論）的作曲家黎錦暉先生本年度印刷的歌曲集也頗爲不少，例如他交與同聲書局出版的同聲歌曲集就有十餘集之多，新歌總共怕不下三四百首，這可謂一大盛事。這些歌曲集都有一個甜蜜的或壯偉的名字，如（少女低吟曲）（甜歌五打）（小樓春曲）（清風曲集）（隨便哼哼集）（猛虎山歌）（勇士豪歌）······，内容據說都頗能陶情養性，增進人生樂趣的，至於是否眞有這功效，那却不是我所知道的了。</p>
<p>此外，中外的電影歌曲也有不少被投機的人印刷了發賣的。我們最容易見到的是（姊妹花）和（漁光曲）等。電影歌曲和多少年前的歌曲併成印一本的也有，如（人間仙子）和（桃花江）等雜七雜八印成一本之類的，也常可見到。天一公司高天棲馬陃芬（已退出）用１２３音樂研究會的名義在本年印了一本（新催眠曲），把天一公司從（歌塲春色）起到一九三三年許多有聲片中的歌曲，都印刷了出來。爵士音樂會也刋行了好多本的爵士音樂。另外自也不免有一些歌唱新曲的刋行，但這裹也不須去詳說牠了。至於音樂的理論書籍，則更見貧乏，我們到現在還不易舉出幾本有價値的音樂書名來呢。</p>
<p>總之，中國音樂出版界目前還幼稚落後得很，現在我們還不大能接觸到有價値的音樂曲籍及作品，這將有待於一般學音樂的人的努力了。</p>
<p>五，音樂論爭小記</p>
<p>在十月底新夜報的（音樂週刋）上登了一篇汀石君的（從音樂藝術說到中國的實用主義）的文字，卽引起了中華日報（動向）上一位穆華君的注意，寫了一篇（反對一個唯心論者加於音樂之毒害）的文字，以爲駁詰，接着雙方爭論起來，筆槍墨劍，小小地攪了幾個回合。汀石君本來的意見是重視西洋的精神生活，他提出了有條件地復古，和平衡人民的精神生活與物質生活的兩個要求。穆華君指出精神生活不能脫離物質生活而獨立，在目前日漸崩潰的經濟情形下，人民的物質生活也絶無法平衡，汀石君的平衡人民物質生活興精神生活的要求之提出，不但是徒然而且是有害的。穆華君又指出汀石君對復古下的定義和復古運動的合流處，說這也是有害的。汀石君後來回答說，（我要申明我從未要求復古），這様一來，所謂（復古）問題也就失去了標的了。關於物質生活與精神生活的平衡問題，汀石君又申明說，他也是不滿於目前的物質生活的，不過他以爲要改造物質生活可不必從正面改革物質生活着手，而要從平衡着手。但穆華君又反駁說，這是他不懂得物質生活對精神生活的决定關係的結果，實際上卽使他要去平衡恐怕也是做不到的。</p>
<p>這次的論爭並未好好的發展下去，所得的結果不過如此。究竟誰是誰非，後來也未見有第三者出來加以論斷或參加討論。</p>
<p>六，音樂的前途赡望</p>
<p>一九三四年的中國音樂界雖不曾有過豐美的收獲，但牠的光明的前途却已是預示了的。新音樂的新芽將不斷的生長，而流行俗曲已不可避免的快要走到末路上去了。高級的音樂已在逐漸引起社會人士的注意，民衆化的音樂，通過電影，已逐漸的爲廣大民衆所接受所歡迎，雖然目前流行的俗樂在播音界歌舞界還能煊赫一時，但這現象已顯得不能長久維持下去的了。這只要看連歌舞界的（祖宗）都來組織（新歌播音社）和跳舞廳的音樂隊去同流合汚這兩件事便可以得到證明的。這已充分表示了那種玩意兒不過是供人享樂，没有多少價値的東西。</p>
<p>說到這裹，話是說完了。最後我還要申明一句，就是我個人對於音樂並不（那個），這裹所說的容有錯誤和遺漏的地方，這是要請讀者諸君指正的。</p>

<p>船夫們臉上隨着老闆的吆喝聲起着各様的表情，嘴張開得像河魚似的歪着；碗口粗的竹槓，橫穿在船的前後梢，三十多人就那麽分成四起，抬轎般地把船抬着；一陣（阿唷唷！抬喲！）的悲壯喊聲過後，船才移動了尺把遠近。</p>
<p>前艙的那幾個客人，看得高興，也忙走過去帮着船夫抬着。</p>
<p>船老闆看着笑了，望着我說；（你老没有過個玩意兒吧？哈哈！）他狂笑了一陣，接着又把烟桿兒往嘴裹一送，呼呼地吸起來。</p>
<p>船漸漸地離河底深了，船夫們就剩了頭還在水面上；前梢的幾個船夫，一個個地搶着跳上船拿取篙撑着，船漸漸地活動起來了。</p>
<p>我跟着跳上了船，身上便覺着一陣砭骨的寒冷，頓時抖戰起來；許多船夫都望着我笑着說：（你老個様怕冷，可了不得！等一會前面還多着哩！）</p>
<p>（唔！）我隨便應着。</p>
<p>我忙着穿了衣服走出艙來，站在船頭眺望一會，很少見到河面上有别的船隻往來；沿河一帶田堘，盡長着幾尺來高的青草，窮盡了視綫，都見不到一座村落；一片荒凉，靜寂得使我想到了另一世界！</p>
<p>我呆看了一會，不覺起了一種又是咀咒，又是凄楚的感覺！</p>
<p>船夫們像忘記剛才的疲乏，三三兩兩地在船頭上閙着；有的在唱着家鄉的情歌，有的在拿着烟桿吸着，船頭上充滿了愉快的情緒。</p>
<p>（還有多少路又要下水呢？）我走到那個老船夫身傍問着。</p>
<p>（早哩！要是風大，晚上就要下水了；弄不好，要到明早也說不定！）他一面吸着烟，一面這様地說。</p>
<p>（那前面呌什麽灘呢？到貴溪還得過多少灘才到？）我躭心的問。</p>
<p>（那是没有名字的，不過水淺處就呌（灘）；到貴溪總還有五六回船好抬。唉！眞是要命！）他嘆了口氣，把頭搖了搖。</p>
<p>（那可糟了！還有個多灘······）</p>
<p>他不等我說完便搶着說：（你老，個算多麽？嘿·你要是到贛州去，那才多呢十八灘！嘿！那裹水流才急喲！十八灘！）</p>
<p>（個個船夫可不好做啊！抬船，不會累死人嗎？）我驚異地嘆着說。</p>
<p>（有什麽法子，我們就靠抬船吃飯的啊！過了貴溪就不用了，我們都在那裹上岸；要等到南昌的（快船）過貴溪，我們才又有了生活。唉！不是人幹的啊！）他的手在鬍子上摸了兩下，接着說；（從小孩子起，活到個長的鬍子，還是在個裹靠肩膊吃飯：眞的，慚愧死了！）涙水從他那乾癟的眼眶裹流了下來。</p>
<p>（唔吃飯不容易啊！）我剛說這一句，就聽見船艙裹喊吃飯了。（完）</p>

<h3>（新型人）難上鏡頭的理由（下）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>特點的凑合構成開末拉面型</p>
<p>幻象的先入觀衆習尚受陶鎔</p>
<p>還有一件很古怪的事，而値得我們一加深思的，就是新進青年演員的容易成功的，從（人緣）一方面說，不一定在酬勞一方面，還是那些和已經成功的前輩形貌相像的幾個。我們統觀影業的過去，享受最大的成功，在影界支持最長久的，要推葛蘿利亞史璜蓀（ＧＬＯＲＩＡＳＷＡＮＳＯＮ）爲第一了。她自動地離開了影界爲了她要獨立，要羅曼諦克但是要是她不離開影界，她可以直到現在，還是一個赫赫的紅星。在史璜蓀脫離了銀幕之後，我們又有了一位費蕾（ＦＡＹＷＲＡＹ）。我們可以確定的說，費蕾的面貌像史璜蓀，至少帮助她得了一個絶好的機遇。當費蕾將她的新型的面容，擺在電影苣頭和觀衆面前的時候，那種事實，她的面貌和一位燦爛的影后相彷彿，非但於她無害，却反帮助了她的成功。或者費蕾自已並没有覺察到這一點，但是倘使她自已審查一下，她定會承認那是確切不移的事實的。當然，費蕾在插進了影國之後，一定要確定她眞實的價値的，否則她就不能在這流沙似的影國長久立足了。但是史璜蓀的形貌，却已代她預先向觀衆們下了一個說帖了。</p>
<p>再則你看見了凱塞琳赫本（ＫＡＴＨＥＲＩＮＥＨＥＰＢＵＲＮ），不是就會聯想到嘉寳女士（ＧＲＥＴＡＧＡＲＢＯ）的嗎？她起初不就是被大衆們呼爲美國嘉寳的嗎？如果今天赫本很高興，你向她說她面貌，極像瑞典女郎，因此帮助她的成功，她一定會頷首稱是的。但是在她不高興的時候，你提起了這句話，她就要生氣喊道：（嘉寳是誰？我不認識？因爲她野貓似的脾氣是如此的。</p>
<p>那還是遠在默片時代哩，在福斯公司開拍（七重天）的時候，一般工作人員看了珍妮蓋諾（ＪＡＮＥＴＧＡＹＮＯＲ），十個之中倒有九個搖着頭的。他們不知道這新型的女郎是誰，而（七重天）却是一張希望極大的影片。他們疑心公司裹的巨頭頭腦不清，將這重要的角色，輕易叫這面目生疏的人去演。他們不知道巨頭們的眼光很遠欠。他們看準了珍妮諾就是洛伊絲威爾蓀（ＬＯＩＳＷＩＬＳＯＮ）的袖珍本。那時洛伊絲威爾蓀的天眞爛漫代表一個純潔無瑕的女性，早已深深印入觀衆們的腦海中也。</p>
<p>琴妮伊格爾（ＪＥＡＮＮＥＥＡＧＥＬＳ）的一段事跡是很悽慘的。她的攻入有聲電影，係因爲那時舞臺方面要懲誡她，暫時不給她工作。她就拂袦而去，跑到好萊塢。她演了一張ＴＨＥＬＥＴＴＥＲ居然一舉成名。她那别致的面容，光茫的頭髮，一上銀幕，更覺得輝煌了。但是可惜得很，她没有能長久享受她的成功，却不知不覺地替瑪琳黛德麗許（ＭＡＲＬＥＮＥＤＩＥＴＲＩＣＨ）造就了一個現成的地盤。瑪琳黛德麗許和琴妮伊格爾可以算得一對姊妹花。這並不是說瑪琳的受聘來美，完全是因爲她的像琴妮伊格爾，但我們却可以說，她的像琴妮伊格爾，却是我們一看見就喜歡她的原因的一個。</p>
<p>至於仇麗海登（ＪＵＬＩＥＨＡＹＤＯＮ），因爲她極像安哈婷（ＡＮＮＨＡＲＤＩＮＧ），就在戲中扮演安哈婷的女兒，因而得到了一個重要的地位，尤其是人人所知道的事實。起初公司裹並不想要仇麗在　珞璐上留下什麽深刻的痕跡，但是事後，從影迷們的信札中，却就看出她已經藉此一階，升堂入室起來，居然博到了雷電華公司一張長期的合同。</p>
<p>因此，我們覺得新型的美女，凡是能在銀幕上持久的，還是那些戴着舊面具的人那些我們已經看慣了的面具。開末拉對於這幾種面型，特别的優厚，因爲們幾種面型，是映射出一種不可思議的東西的，而那種不可思議的東西，我們祇可以稱之爲幻象（ＩＬＬＵＳＩＯＮ）。面容的端正，就是普通我們所稱爲美貌的反而很少能上鏡頭的。</p>
<p>不過無論是新型的面容，或是我們所看慣的老面孔，决不是可以摩倣的。專事摩倣外表，而臺無實質的内容，是會弄巧成拙的。那些面貌像已成名的大明星，因而成功的，並不是單靠她們面容的和某人某人相像。她們一定要脫離類同而力求一已的獨立和異様。她們的所以像史璜蓀，像嘉寳，像誰，像誰，都是開末拉的故弄玄虚而已。但是她們要是没本身的實質技能，即使開末拉一度抬舉了她們，她們亦是無法永久維持她們的地位的。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（海上行宮）</h3>
<p>— 權漢</p>
<p>Transatlantic</p>
<p>Merry_Go_Round—大上海</p>
<p>好萊塢電影，從（一九三四年）起，將從來嚴肅的偵探影片，披上了歌舞的彩衣．這一傾向的展開，無疑的是依據着輕鬆明快的影片之受人歡迎而來的。</p>
<p>然而不管形式怎様，偵探影片不能採取新的内容，始終不能挽救偵探影片的没落。那種僅是無原則描寫男女間所謂愛的糾紛，到底不會使要求表現現實的人們，感覺興趣的。在這裹没有眞實的内容，僅僅是愛的糾紛和海盜的成分。說到這一點，這也許和好萊塢的清潔運動相牴觸，誨淫誨盜的影片是被正人君子們列爲被清之類的。不過在新的見解上來說，只要作者原來是爲了暴露現實而攝製，其作用並不在獲得誨淫或誨盜之反面的效果，那末，採取淫與盜作題材，决不是道德的墮落，相反的，在表現現實的意義上，會有其偉大的成功。然而這一要求，對於美國的電影作家，却是不容易爲他們所接受的。</p>
<p>在（海上行宮）中表現了一些什麽？導演是怎様表現的呢？這裹有着華麗的歌舞，旖旎的情歌，以及調情。賭博和偷竊的賣弄聰明，這些都使尋求娛樂的人們，感覺若干的興趣。</p>
<p>此外，我們在這一影片中找不到什麽特别可以學習的東西。在這新年中，給觀衆們快樂快樂也是好的。</p>
<h3>（天倫）裏有國旗三種</h3>
<p>— 聯</p>
<p>這消息不知從何傅來，說費穆脫離聯華轉入别家公司，這事雖經多日未見證實，可是依然有外界人在半信半疑。所以有關心聯華與愛護費穆的諸君近來紛紛投函詢及此事。從此看來，費穆在聯華，也可說在中國影界確實是關係甚鉅了。然而謠傅是謠傅，事實是事實，實在的，他與羅明佑合導的（天倫）確已開拍了。這裹還報告大家一件偉大的事體，是（天倫）裹有三種國旗。大家想，一部片裹單說國旗就用了三種，你說够偉大不够偉大？這時費穆在傍見書此稿，不禁笑曰：（可惜這裹僅有三種國旗，如果有萬國旗那更偉大了！）聞者多稱老費幽默。</p>
<h3>一九三五年明星新片</h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>一九三五年明星公司急待公映於攝製中的新片有如下幾部：</p>
<p>（空谷蘭）是張石川導演，胡蝶，高占非主演。該片原是明星當年的默片，内容是極盡（情節曲折）（哀感頑絶）之能事。這次改爲聲片，當然此默片更可觀了。</p>
<p>（落花時節）是吳村繼重婚後的第二部傑作，主題描寫一羣義勇與一個少女流落到上海來吃盡人生痛苦的故事，從（落花時節）到（大雪霏霏）的冬天來表現出非常沉痛的情調。畫面像詩一般的美麗，洋溢着（歡樂）與（悲哀）的氣節。</p>
<p>（人倫）是李萍倩導演，龔稼農，鄭小秋，朱秋痕主演，描寫一個青年到老的悽慘的經過，怎様的失業，怎様的妻離子散，怎様的不幸而入獄，這是一部類似保羅茂尼的（亡命者）。</p>
<p>（夜來香）（船家女）（夜會）都是聲片，三者都是描寫都市的黑暗，罪惡，經濟崩潰，農村破産等，在這暴風雨的時代，像這一類的影片，無疑的是有着重要的意義。導演爲程步高，沈西苓，姚蘇鳳。</p>
<p>其它還有一年前便攝竣的（美人心），暫時擱置中的鄉愁，新光，中央兩戲院正在公映的（再生花）（上海廿四小時）等。（却）</p>
<h3>民國二十四年向（大路）邁進</h3>
<p>— 松花</p>
<p>民國二十四年的元旦，首先興國人接觸的，是金成開映的聯華影業公司出品（大路），這，或許是新中國邁進（大路）的象徵吧？讓我們以此預祝！</p>
<p>（大路）是聯華公司集中全力的一部出品，就其意義，導演與演員各方面論之，它實在有超於一切的價値。因此，在攝製期中，（大路）在社會上，已經建起了堅固的期望與信仰。而現在所築成的（大路），當然是不負國人的企望。</p>
<p>在意義上，（大路）實在是表現了中國羣衆團結力量的偉大。在帝國主義與土豪劣紳交相壓迫中的中國，自救的方法，只有待於自身的團結與努力，這是無疑的在片中，土豪劣紳用了多種的方法，以破壞羣衆的陣線，然而由於羣衆内部的鞏固，終於失敗了這，一方面暴露了帝國主義與惡劣勢力勾結的醜惡，他方面顯現了羣衆力量的不可侮，其意義的嚴重性，題材的現實性，無疑是今日中國所迫切需要的影片。</p>
<p>本片的導演，是復興國片的導演孫瑜，憑他以往在中國影壇上所建樹的功動，我們當然可以信任他的演員以金燄領銜，聚陳燕燕·黎莉莉·張翼·羅明等十二明星合演，聯華的男明星，始已全數薈萃於此片中了演出方面，旣悲壯，又詼諧，處處抓住觀衆情緒·劇力强勁，得未曾有·的確是一部値得影迷注意的影片。</p>
<h3>電聲週刋新年特大號</h3>
<p>電聲電影圖畫週刋。爲慶祝二十四年元旦及答謝各愛護之讀者起見。特發刋新年特大號。内容精彩並增加銅圖及文字十二頁。所刋照片均極名貴。且多係特攝者。尤以（阮玲玉與唐季珊）（胡蝶與潘有聲）（陳燕燕與王紹芬）等影星情侶照片最爲珍貴。至於文字有（二十三年電影大事紀）（好萊塢私生子之傾銷）（香烟皇后胡蝶大觸霉頭）及（女明星私生活之秘密）多段。乃外間無從探悉者。每册售大洋一角。並附增播音週報一大張。已於元旦日出版。各大書局。報攤均有出售。總發行上海南京路五十四號三和出版社。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>警吏乘龍（White　Lies）（二）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>瓊正在浴盆裹洗澡。她一面撥着水，一面自已想着，怎様去和這個泰萊康登見一面。她自已腦筋裹描畫着，這個膽大包身的警察，到底是怎様的一個人物。他身材是高高的嗎？面色是黑黑的嗎？身體是瘦瘦的嗎？頭髮是紅紅的嗎？眼睛是未言先笑的嗎？她自已明明知道，她和亞塞爾勃蘭特利是訂過婚約。就是今天晚上，她還要和他一同出去哩。但是她却拿不定主意，倘使她一旦和這個泰萊見面的時候，她的一顆芳心，究竟會不會起什麽變化。</p>
<p>這個時候，密契爾正坐在他的書室裹，很興奮地讀着一段新聞的校様，剛才的一切已經忘記得影跡全無了。因爲他現在手裹所有的新聞，是一段駭人聽聞的新聞，是他的快報所獨有的。那段新聞，極爲曲折離奇，動人處可使人泣下。原來是一個銀行重要職員，名字叫丹奥立佛的，幾年以前從銀行裹盜取了三萬元一筆欵子。但是盜取了之後，又深自悔恨起來，時時刻刻想陸續償還。他已經逐漸放進去了一大半，所剩的不過一萬元之數，可是他的事情已經被人發覺了。快報的記者，名叫羅伯資的，是首先知道這件事的人。可是他已經答應了奥立佛，不將這個消息披露，因爲奥立佛苦苦哀求，給他一條自新之路，况且他已經在深自懺悔之中。羅伯資是個軟心腸的人，就滿口答應了奥立佛代他暫守秘密。可是，密契爾不答應起來。他說那不是他培植他的報紙的方法。他說他祇有一個方針就是得到新聞，得的快，得的對！此外一切都不管！誰碰上去了，誰倒霉，祇要他没有控告的餘地！就說這個丹奥立佛罷。他做錯了事了，犯了刑法了。那都是事實呀。因此，他，密契爾就可以大喊特喊地將他犯罪的經過，一字不遺地在他的報紙上宣佈出來。這様一下，大家都要搶着買快報看。那就是推廣報紙銷路的合法手段。而丹奥立佛呢，他不過是一個合法的倒霉蛋，活該被他利用而已。</p>
<p>到了明天一早，他坐了大汽車到他的報館去的時候，他一路想着他眼前的勝利，不覺滿心愉快起來。他好像已經聽到機器房裹的印報紙，雷聲隆隆地旋轉起來。他又好像聽見街頭巷口，一般賣報童子，提高了喉嚨叫喚着。他又好像聽見街上亂烘烘地，議論着這件驚人的案子，又好像聽見大家稱讚，到底還是快報消息靈通，是别家報紙及不到的地方。等到他的車走進了閙市，在亂烘烘的人羣中走過去的時候，他又想起了他的女兒，不知道她現在在做些什麽。或者這在作她的甜蜜的春夢哩，這個小鬼頭。他又不覺格格笑了起來。他的女兒和一個警察先生。要是她不替他說情的話，那個警察大槪現在祇好蕩馬路白相了。</p>
<p>一回兒已經到了快報的報館裹。一般職員們正在熙攘往來，忙得不可開交。打字機的聲音，電話鈴的聲音，談話的聲音，以及地下層印報機的聲音，混雜在一起，成功了一個報館事業興旺的氣象。密契爾一路走，一路向大家點頭。他走進了他的私人辦公室。他將例行公事略爲過了一過目，就吩咐將本埠新聞編輯請來。一回兒本埠新聞編輯來了，他就吩咐道：（將一切别的東西搬開，拿這個丹奥立佛案子放在第一版。在這幾張校様裹，還有許多有更改的地方。第一，在銅版下面的一行字，應改爲（丹奥立佛，重要銀行職員，因儘佔被逮。其餘的，我都寫好，你自已去看好了。）主筆先生連聲答應了，就往外走。密契爾還在後面喊着道：（趕快些！三十分鐘之内，我的報就要在街上賣的！）（未完）</p>

<h3>Shi Zhiquan Discusses Japanese Justice</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Zhiquan has completed his inspection of Japanese justice. He returned to Nanjing with Hong Wenlan on the 1st. According to Shi, this inspection took one and a half months, one month in Tokyo, and more than ten days elsewhere. All Japanese codes, except the Constitution, have been revised. The main points of the revisions are to preserve the inherent purity and beautiful customs, maintain the family system, and respect the spirit of etiquette in order to remedy the various malpractices arising from individualism in recent times. What can be learned from the inspection includes: (1) Prosecutors consider the personality, age, circumstances, and the situation at the time of the crime. Even if a crime is confirmed, prosecution may be suspended. In addition to ordering the offender to compensate for losses or apologize, they are also required to submit a letter of self-renewal and be supervised by relatives and friends. Recidivism is rare. (2) Special prosecutors are appointed to handle cases involving communists and other so-called ideological offenders. These prosecutors must also study ideological issues and lecture on methods of prevention, so that communist offenders can repent on their own. (3) Minor cases under primary jurisdiction are handled according to simplified procedures, with two-thirds being sentenced by order without trial. Only 5% request a formal trial due to dissatisfaction. (4) In civil mediation cases, mediation committees selected by the court achieve settlement in 70-80% of cases. Prisons focus on rehabilitation. Institutions that exist in Japan but not in our country include juvenile courts, juvenile correctional institutions, and welfare institutions, as well as the notary public system, deposit system, and auction system. Our country should gradually emulate these. Shi also said that he is currently drafting an inspection report, which will be completed soon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Influence of the Franco-Italian Rapprochement by Heng</h3>
<p>After the Great War, France seemed to regard itself as the leader on the European continent. Although Italy was also part of the Entente, the various verbal promises made by Britain and France at the time to persuade it to join the Entente were barely fulfilled. As a result of its frustration, it was filled with resentment and could not help but feel jealous of France's position. Its ambition to peer into the Balkans and vie for Central Europe was also barely restrained. Therefore, in any setting, it often clashed with France. Notable examples include frequently courting Romania, a friend of France, in the hope of cooperation, and colluding with Germany, a historical enemy of France, to plot against France. Even its recent relationship with Hungary, initially, was not aimed at countering the Little Entente under the Versailles system. It was only after discovering Hitler's ambitions for Austria that it was arranged to be a vanguard against Germany. Therefore, the conflict between France and Italy has not only been long-standing, but the rift has also been deep. The fact that they can now abandon their past grievances and cooperate cannot be said to be a major shift in international relations.</p>
<p>The cooperation between France and Italy began last summer when Germany annexed Austria. Therefore, the process of its brewing has not been a matter of a day or two. However, it almost came to a halt after the Marseille incident. Ultimately, due to the sincerity of both France and Italy, the opportunity for cooperation was not extinguished. Secret negotiations have been underway for the past few months. However, given the complexity of the two countries' past relations and the differences in their aspirations, it is indeed difficult to reach a compromise. Therefore, Laval's trip to Rome was repeatedly postponed. Now that Laval has made the trip, there should be no major obstacles to the progress of the Franco-Italian negotiations.</p>
<p>What is the content of Franco-Italian cooperation? So far, there is little accurate information. Both countries are keeping it a secret and do not want to reveal anything. Therefore, whether what has been reported is reliable remains to be seen in the future. However, according to our speculation, the important issues between France and Italy are nothing more than four points: (1) The redistribution of North African colonies. (2) Guaranteeing the independence of Austria. (3) Revision of the Treaty of Versailles. (4) Naval equality. On these issues, France and Italy clearly have different positions. It is worthy of pondering what kind of approach will be taken to reach a compromise. According to recent European news, both France and Italy are shelving the issue of Franco-Italian naval equality, probably due to concessions from the Italian side. At the same time, France has conditionally accepted the proposal to revise the treaties of Central Europe, meaning that France is willing to consider any revision proposal that does not use violence. This is another indication of France's concession. As for the issue of Austrian independence, we have heard American newspapers claiming that Italy hopes that all related countries will jointly guarantee Austria, and especially hopes that all countries will entrust it with full power so that it can send troops to help Austria in the event of an emergency. If this news is true, then Italy regards Austria as a region of special interest. A few days ago, we heard that Franco-Italian negotiations encountered obstacles due to the issue of Austrian independence. Perhaps the point of conflict lies there. Now that the negotiations have returned to smooth progress, has the Italian side given up its previous proposal? Or has it obtained considerable satisfaction with the allocation of colonies? The inside story is, of course, not known to outsiders.</p>
<p>Judging from Laval's visit to Italy, the future of Franco-Italian cooperation seems very optimistic. If this matter can be accomplished, then the European situation can at least achieve a state of stability. Although the proposal for treaty revision may not be realized through peaceful means, Franco-Italian cooperation is still enough to make the countries in Central Europe that advocate treaty revision lose powerful leadership. Furthermore, since Austria is guaranteed by the surrounding countries, Germany's ambition to annex Austria will be even more difficult to realize. Therefore, regardless of whether Germany has the possibility of participating in the guarantee, it will not be affected in fact by its refusal to participate. Therefore, it is also not impossible to say that the cooperation between France and Italy has the same effect as the cooperation between France and Russia. In a nutshell, the purpose of the Franco-Italian rapprochement is twofold: to prevent Germany from developing to the northeast and to prevent Germany from developing to the southeast. In essence, both are intended to maintain the status quo in Europe in order to achieve temporary stability.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress Seeks Stability for the People</h3>
<p>Recognizes that the International Situation is Deteriorating Daily</p>
<p>Hopes that Steady Leaders Will Turn the Tide</p>
<p>Strives to Avoid Being Drawn into the Whirlpool of World War</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt personally read his executive message to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at 12:30 this afternoon, declaring that for the sake of the peace of mind of the American people, he would propose a broad plan to achieve the following: (1) Use natural resources to seek security for the lives of all the people in the country. (2) Guarantee the stability of life. (3) Guarantee the safety of respectable families. The President further stated that we have been entrusted by the people with a clear mandate. Americans must eliminate the concept of private forces manipulating public and private enterprises to seek wealth. To accomplish the above goals, we do not want to destroy desire, nor do we want to divide wealth equally. We still believe that some people should receive more rewards because of their great talents. The President continued that the desire of individuals to seek appropriate security, reasonable leisure, and a respectable life is better than the ambition to seek wealth and power. The President suggested that, within the scope of the government's economic capacity, the various public works projects should be merged into a larger-scale plan, and the federal government would no longer bear the burden of relief efforts. The President recalled the achievements of the recovery in 1934, saying that farmers had gained real benefits, and that industry and commerce were thriving, which was gratifying. The President then</p>
<h3>Discussed International Relations</h3>
<p>Stated that he could not honestly say that the situation outside the borders had improved. The old enemies and ambitions of the past have resurfaced in the international arena. Some countries are competing for armaments and power with fierce faces. He deeply hoped that calm and steady leaders could use their great power to turn the tide, and hoped for a steady international leader who would ultimately offer a new and practical representative government to the world. After the President's message, he dismissed the notion that the United States would be drawn into the vortex of war, and refuted the fallacy that international cooperation could not reduce or limit armaments. The President stated that maintaining international peace is a matter of deep concern to us, and there is no selfishness. We have repeatedly made concrete expressions in preventing war, so there is no reason to speculate that the United States has any ambition in its relationship with any country other than peace, etc. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Support from All Parties</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's personal reading of his message to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at 12:30 this afternoon received unanimous support from the Democratic and Republican parties. Senate Democratic Leader Robinson stated that this message was one of the most important messages in American history, and predicted that members of both parties would work together to realize the President's intentions. Robinson continued that while there may be disagreements on the details, he believed that Congress would unanimously express satisfaction with the President's plan and purpose. Republican leaders were not as enthusiastic in their attitude, but also fully supported the President's plan and expressed full cooperation in its realization. Senate Republican Leader McNary called it a message with far-reaching vision. Republican senators also unanimously expressed their approval. House Republican Leader Snell did not want to criticize the President's message, but believed that the President's declaration could be seen as an indication of the government's shift to the right. Some observers paid particular attention to President Roosevelt's views on foreign policy, and all believed that the President's declaration would ease the situation and avoid the shipbuilding competition between Britain, the United States, and Japan after Japan abandoned the Washington Naval Treaty. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Work Relief Reduces Unemployment</h3>
<p>(Washington) The main points of President Roosevelt's address to Congress this afternoon were unemployment relief. President Roosevelt plans to revise the entire federal relief plan, advocating work relief and launching large-scale public works to abolish the method of alms. President Roosevelt pointed out that this could create a new order to guarantee social security. President Roosevelt declared that the government would adopt a plan within the scope of the government's sound credit, and said that this work included a wide range of projects. The clearing of slums, the construction of rural housing, universal electrification, the promotion of forests, the prevention of soil erosion, the opening of wasteland, the improvement of road administration, the construction of highways, and many other undertakings that the country cannot ignore, which private capital cannot handle, will be carried out in turn. This major plan is expected to absorb 3.5 million unemployed people. He has seen signs of the restoration of the spirit of credit, but he wants to warn speculators and partisan politicians not to obstruct our progress.</p>
<h3>Almsgiving Destroys Inherent Virtues</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt then recounted the previous temporary emergency relief legislation, saying that the number of unemployed people remains very large. The facts show that providing relief through almsgiving is a narcotic, which only destroys the spirit of people and destroys the inherent virtues of America. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Accumulating Wealth Should Be Repelled</h3>
<p>In addition, President Roosevelt declared that he would read the budget message on Monday. This budget would not exceed the limit of the funds available to the government. The President would also immediately propose to Congress bills on unemployment and old-age insurance, maternal and child relief, etc. In addition, the President would also submit to Congress for consultation matters such as the federal government's strengthening of control over the transportation industry, the reform of the recovery plan, the reform of the judicial system and the veterans' association system, the restriction of the abuse of ownership, and the continued control of agriculture. The message concluded by saying that (what we call individual interests is the right of individuals to properly support themselves and their families. As for the concept of accumulating wealth, all Americans should reject it, because the result of accumulating wealth is that individuals can use excessive profits to operate their private businesses, and public affairs will inevitably suffer as a result). (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy Emphasizes Good Neighborliness</h3>
<p>Referring to foreign policy, he said that he hoped that politicians from all countries would lay the foundation for the international political situation with a spirit of calm and construction, so that all countries would have the necessary time to create a new type of representative government throughout the world, so that the privileged classes could be reduced, and the welfare of the general public could be increased day by day. The President's message further stated that (currently, no country, even if it does not aspire to peace, is likely to have a conflict with our United States. There is a fallacious theory that excessive armaments cannot be reduced and limited by international agreements, and therefore the people are at risk of increasing the burden of armaments. However, the people of most countries will surely find ways to overcome the consequences of this fallacious theory. This is undoubtedly the case). (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>White House Meeting to Draft New Procedures for Relief Work</h3>
<p>Salaries of Government Officials to Be Reduced for Six Months</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and seven senators and six congressmen met in the President's study today for three hours to draft new procedures for government relief work so that they could be implemented immediately. The estimated urgent need is $880 million, part of which may be taken from existing unspent relief funds. It is said that temporary relief work will be reduced as soon as possible, and the remaining relief funds will be transferred to the new procedures. The social procedures mentioned by President Roosevelt in his message to Congress yesterday will be carried out quickly. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt has asked Congress to allocate $4 billion to launch large-scale public works so that 3.5 million people can have work. Those who attended the meeting at the President's office were Harrison, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Vice President of the United States, Caleb, Senate Democratic Leader, Robinson, Senator Pittman, and Speaker of the House, Barnes, etc. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the announcement here today, President Roosevelt is continuing to reduce the salaries of federal officials by 5% for a period of six months. The general public in political circles had hoped that full salaries could be restored after the New Year, but now they are disappointed and must wait for another six months.

<h3>Mussolini and Laval Meet in Venice</h3>
<p>Three Protocols Drafted, Ready for Signing</p>
<p>Philippine Colonial Issue Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>Rome French Foreign Minister Laval arrived here at 7 pm last night. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, state officials, the French Ambassador to Italy, and French nationals gathered at the station to give him a warm welcome.

The first is a joint declaration between France and Italy on the independence of Austria, the second is a non-interference protocol, which will be signed by Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Hungary, and the third is an agreement between France and Italy on African colonies. Regarding the understanding on colonies, Laval did not bring any experts with him on this trip, indicating that there is still important work to be done. It is said that Italy is completely dissatisfied with the territorial and railway concessions made by France and hopes that France can be more generous. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Communiqué Issued</h3>
<p>Rome French Foreign Minister Laval met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Venice Palace this morning. When arriving at the palace, he received a fascist salute. Upon entering the conference room, the Italian Prime Minister reached out to welcome him. According to the authorities, the talks between the French Foreign Minister and the Italian Prime Minister this morning lasted for two hours. The French Ambassador to Rome and the Italian Deputy Foreign Minister were present. It was also said that a First Secretary of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Director of African Affairs went to the Zhiji Palace to discuss current issues.</p>
<h3>Audience with the Italian King</h3>
<p>After the talks, Laval had an audience with the Italian King and did not leave the palace until lunchtime. Soldiers and police lined the streets along Laval's route. This morning, the Chargé d'Affaires of Abyssinia also had an audience with the Italian King. It is said that Italy is eager to make its peaceful intentions clear to the Abyssinian people, as the tense situation between the two countries could obstruct the friendly agreement between France and Italy. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome The agreement between France and Italy is still being prepared. It is generally believed that it cannot be finalized before Sunday evening. After having dinner at the Embassy last night, French Foreign Minister Laval went to work at the Hotel Excelsior and did not go to bed until late at night. At 9:30 this morning, Laval went to the Venice Palace to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini, and they discussed the various diplomatic issues in Europe for about two hours. However, the nature of this talk was, of course, general and will need to be supplemented by more precise talks later. On the other hand, experts from France and Italy will also study in detail solutions to various issues related to the African colonies. After Laval and the Prime Minister finished talking, they went to pay their respects to King Emmanuel III. The King invited him for a light meal. The Prime Minister is scheduled to host a banquet at the Venice Palace tonight to welcome Laval. (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Conclusion of Pact Guaranteeing Peace in Central Europe is Hopeful</h3>
<p>(Rome) The first important meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval this morning has been going smoothly. There is great hope for the conclusion of a pact to guarantee peace in Europe. Hungary's reserved attitude towards the Austrian issue has made it necessary to establish a temporary solution to maintain Hungary's rights. After Hungary is satisfied with this, the future of the European situation has become optimistic. The Italian and French governments now firmly agree that Austrian independence must be maintained. The pact to protect Austrian independence will invite Germany, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary to participate. Hungary has expressed conditional support. As for Hungary's conditions, it will still retain its consistent policy of revising the Treaty of Saint-Germain, but will allow its actions not to go beyond the scope of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, it will never use war or any violence as a tool to achieve its national aspirations. In addition, Mussolini and Laval also agreed to delineate the borders of Libya and the new status of Italians in Tunisia. These two issues have long been a source of trouble between the two countries. The first meeting this morning began to disperse at 11:30. French Foreign Minister Laval then paid his respects to the Italian King and did not retire for about half an hour. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>France Concedes Philippine Colonial Issue, Italy Not Satisfied</h3>
<p>(Paris) Reliable news: The Rome Agreement stipulates that the French government will cede 500,000 square miles of its Sahara territory to Italy. The Sahara is inhabited by more than 200,000 Tebou people. It is also said that Italy is demanding land up to Lake Chad, but the French government wants to retain a 500-mile-wide corridor area.

<h3>Britain Holds High Hopes</h3>
<p>(London) The British government fully agrees with the goals of the negotiations now underway between Italy and France in Rome. A communiqué was recently issued stating that the British government has instructed Sir Drummond, the British Ambassador to Italy, to express to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval in the personal name of Foreign Secretary Simon his fervent hope that the current negotiations will be successful. (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Austria Optimistic</h3>
<p>Vienna Foreign Minister Berger recently issued a statement to the press expressing optimism about the results of French Foreign Minister Laval's trip to Rome to hold talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. He said that Chancellor Schuschnigg and he were particularly pleased with the Franco-Italian negotiations. The non-interference pact being negotiated by France and Italy in Rome stipulates that the signatory countries have the obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of other signatory countries, but he hopes to go further and stipulate that it is forbidden to encourage or even tolerate any actions that endanger other signatory countries in any way. Berger also said that the Austrian government has successfully made Austria and Western European countries an important partnership. The plan for the Austrian Chancellor and Foreign Minister to visit Britain and France should further clarify the situation. (Havas Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Poland Suspicious</h3>
<p>The Warsaw government's newspapers seemed quite surprised to hear of French Foreign Minister Laval's trip to Rome. They mostly expressed doubts about the outcome of Laval's trip. However, the right-wing anti-government newspapers strongly affirmed the importance of the rapprochement between France and Italy and said that the Polish government had not tried to eliminate the estrangement between France and Poland, which was inappropriate. (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Unease in Hungary</h3>
<p>The visit of French Foreign Minister Laval to Rome appears to have caused considerable anxiety and unease in Hungary. The Hungarian Telegraphic Agency commented on the matter, stating that the Franco-Italian negotiations would not address the issue of a territorial guarantee pact. This is because once a territorial guarantee pact is established, modifying treaties through peaceful means would become impossible. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the Rome talks, it should not affect the principles of the Hungarian government. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Budapest is paying close attention to the talks between French Foreign Minister Laval and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, as the Rome agreement has strengthened Italo-Hungarian relations. Regarding the revision of treaties, semi-official sources say Mussolini will maintain his original intention of safeguarding Hungarian interests, recognizing Hungarian demands as the only way to maintain stability in the Danube region. Newspapers report that Hungary's lifeline is closely tied to Italy and Germany, with political and economic relations with Germany being particularly essential. Hungary cannot accept French media claims that Germany is a common enemy of France, Italy, and Hungary. In reality, Hungary hopes for cooperation between Germany and Italy.

<h3>Predictions for the European and American Political Situation in 1935</h3>
<p>May: Overthrow of the French Republic, Restoration of the Monarchy. Saar Plebiscite Expected to Pass Peacefully. A Major European Statesman Assassinated Within Two Months. Osaka Mainichi Shimbun carries a special dispatch from Paris. The saying "(Crisis of 1935-1936)" is not only popular in Japan, but also causes great concern in Europe. As this year is 1935, the changes that will occur are attracting much social attention. Someone visited three famous female fortune tellers in Paris: Marno-Dai, Viday, and Cloudet. These three are incredibly knowledgeable and have a proven track record of accurately predicting future political, economic, diplomatic, medical, and other events. The following is a summary of their predictions: (France will have minor issues with its northern neighbors. The economic situation in February will be quite good. Commercial prosperity in March and April will restore the advantage of five or six years ago. The stock market will rise, and unemployment will decrease. This year will be peaceful and without war. The Saar plebiscite will also pass uneventfully, although no one will be satisfied. However, within the next two months, a major foreign statesman will be assassinated. The perpetrator will be a Polish person, an Italian, or a lilac-colored student. Mussolini is safe from harm. After the French general election in May, there will be a change in the national structure, overthrowing the republic. Seven years later, the monarchy will be restored. The United States is expected to have sound currency this year. A cure for cancer and tuberculosis may be completed this year. There will be major incidents at sea and in the air. A major earthquake is also unavoidable. By 1937, there will be a severe epidemic.)</p>

<h3>Japan Retains Control of Mandated Islands, U.S. Temporarily Does Not Interfere</h3>
<p>But Declares Right to Comment</p>
<p>(Washington) Official sources here stated today that the United States does not wish to immediately interfere with Japan's continued mandate over the former German islands in the Pacific. However, officials firmly asserted that, although the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, it has the right to comment on this matter and may exercise its right to resolve the issue at any time. The U.S. Navy Department is quite concerned about reports from Geneva regarding new facilities built by Japan on the mandated islands. These islands are located along routes that U.S. merchant ships must take between the American coast to the east and the Philippines. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Mandates Commission released a report in Geneva yesterday, stating that Japan's construction of seaports on the mandated islands in the Pacific is costing a great deal, which is disproportionate to the commercial relations of those islands. People here are paying close attention to the work of the commission, but believe that while the facts discovered by the commission are considered important by the world, it is not appropriate for the British government to formally negotiate with the Japanese government before the commission presents its conclusions, or to consult with the signatory countries based on the provisions of Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty.

<h3>France's Reply to U.S. Note Explains Naval Stance</h3>
<p>Hopes to Conclude New Treaty to Replace Old One (Washington) French Ambassador to the United States, De Laboulaye, sent a note to the U.S. government this evening, explaining the French government's views on naval issues. The note stated that France hopes that all naval powers, other than the five nations of Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, will also participate in signing a new treaty to replace the Washington Naval Treaty. The note also stated that when the French government requested parliamentary approval to ratify the Washington Naval Treaty, Parliament indicated that the treaty should not be extended after it expires in 1936. When the French government ratified the treaty, it also notified the United States that the 5:5:3 ratio stipulated in the treaty was not suitable for the situation of each country and could only be applied to armored ships and aircraft carriers, but not to other types of warships. The final paragraph of the note stated that the navies of countries outside the signatories of the Washington Treaty should also be considered, because when the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, their navies were not significant, but now the situation is very different.

<h3>New Policy of the Japanese Military in Governing Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Promote the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Group</p>
<p>Expand Intelligence and Special Agencies</p>
<p>(Changchun) General Minami, Commander of the Kwantung Army, and Major General Itagaki, Deputy Chief of Staff, have recently agreed on a fundamental policy toward Manchuria. The main points are divided into two types: (1) The Japan-Manchukuo Economic Group. (A) Establish the economic value of Dalian. (B) Reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR). The SMR Company is recognized as a financial component of the Japan-Manchukuo economic group, so its reorganization should not disperse its financial resources. However, it must be made a purely national policy company. Based on Japan's policy of governing Manchukuo, first merge the SMR with the railways of eastern provinces to form a large railway company. (2) Expansion of intelligence agencies. With the international crisis imminent, the Kwantung Army and the intelligence and special agencies within the Manchukuo organization must be expanded and controlled. It is planned to organize a joint Japan-Manchukuo central intelligence and propaganda control agency in Changchun. (3) Reorganization of the Kwantung Army internally. It is planned to replace most of the personnel in March of this year, eliminate elements from different factions, and reorganize the ranks. (Hualian dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Eden's Speech on the International Situation</h3>
<p>This Year Is the Most Important Year</p>
<p>Praises the League of Nations for Handling Matters Appropriately</p>
<p>European War Temporarily Avoided</p>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden spoke last night in Newcastle on the international situation, saying that there has been much talk of the danger of war recently, but he does not believe that war will break out in the near future. If war were to break out, it would not only harm the conquered, but the victors would also suffer. Eden acknowledged that 1934 was an eventful year, but in the final weeks, the international situation showed definite and even surprising progress, largely due to the League of Nations Council's appropriate handling of dangerous issues such as the Saar plebiscite and the South Hungarian dispute. The Council meetings convened specifically for these two issues were among the most important events in the history of the League of Nations. The first issue concerned maintaining order during the plebiscite period. The British government's suggestion to send troops to join the League of Nations international force stationed in the Saar resolved the issue smoothly. The second issue was even more difficult. The unfortunate assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia in Marseille strained relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary, threatening the maintenance of peace. Therefore, the special responsibility of advocating a fair attitude fell on the shoulders of the British government representative. The League of Nations Council dared to say that within a week, it had found a way to deal with two issues that could greatly damage good relations between European countries, and a satisfactory final outcome was expected. Eden continued that he believed that the organization of an international air force to serve as the world's police force would likely be realized in the future, but the time was not yet ripe. Such a force cannot be realized in an armed world and will only be effective after the world disarms. However, we are still far from this period. He strongly agreed with General Smuts' statement that the League of Nations should not be regarded as a military organization. It would be a mistake to try to create such an organization. Eden concluded by discussing the future of 1935, saying that we are now standing at the threshold of the most important year in post-war history, but we must not be deterministic or self-deprecating. 1935 will prove whether we can make the League of Nations effective. As for him personally, he is optimistic. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Russia Maintains Original Plan for Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>Litvinov's Statement to Czech Press Corps</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov stated clearly to a Czech press corps today that the Soviet Union does not wish to modify the Eastern European Pact. The Soviet Union does not consider the Eastern European Pact to be the maximum plan, but only the minimum plan. According to Litvinov's original plan, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Baltic states would guarantee the eastern borders. Judging from Litvinov's words, it can be seen that the Soviet Union does not want to delete the original draft. (National News Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Consul of a Certain Country Colludes with Russian Terrorist Party</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Says Has International Background</p>
<p>Latvian Envoy Lodges Protest</p>
<p>(Moscow) The consul of a certain country, who is connected to the terrorist party, has been recalled by his government. Izvestia commented on this, saying that (the consul's activities were not of a diplomatic nature. He aided and abetted terrorists, participated in their escape preparations, assisted other terrorists in infiltrating the Soviet Union, and prepared various situations to make armed intervention easier. It is known from reliable sources that the consul was the consul of a small country, and everyone knows that this kind of intervention movement was not initially carried out by a small country (i.e., even the country's army would invade the territory of a large country). All they can do is be the vanguard workers of several large countries, and their actions are carrying out the instructions of those large countries in political, military, and social matters. It is not difficult for us to imagine that there must be a large background behind this strange diplomat, and this background is actually the leader of the consul's actions and other activities and steps in preparing for intervention).

<h3>Saar Plebiscite Approaching</h3>
<p>Residents Gradually Showing Signs of Unease</p>
<p>Opposing German Factions Hold Separate Gatherings Across the River</p>
<p>Authorities Make Careful Arrangements to Maintain Order During the Plebiscite</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saar As the date of the Saar plebiscite approaches, residents throughout the region are gradually showing signs of unease. The tranquility of the past few days is maintained by the wisdom and courage of the international police force. No one dares to predict that voters will advocate for belonging to France, so the Socialist Party and the Communist Party are both afraid for their own positions, doing everything in their power to maintain the status quo and prevent the Saar from returning to Germany. Some Catholics also support this movement because they fear that Hitlerism will destroy the Catholic organization. Tomorrow, opposing parties will hold separate public gatherings, so the police and gendarmes have prepared high-speed cars and open-top vehicles to patrol the city. To prevent conflicts, the authorities have ordered party members to gather across the river at different times and have prohibited wearing uniforms and carrying flags. The results of the vote on the 13th will not be known until two days later. The authorities will implement the most thorough plan to ensure the secrecy of the vote. An outsider will be stationed at each polling place to oversee the process. Voters will seal the ballot they cast and hand it to the supervisor, who will seal it again before putting it into the ballot box. In total, there are 540,000 votes. General speculation focuses on the number of votes to maintain the status quo. Non-optimistic members of the Nazi Party say it could reach 200,000 votes, while enthusiastic supporters of Hitler estimate that this type of vote will not exceed 50,000. The police authorities have ordered the troops to act with caution and be on high alert, but should try to avoid publicity. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Neustadt Neustadt A Reuters reporter visited Saar Commissioner Buckel, who was sent by Hitler. Judging from his remarks, Germany has made various preparations to take over the Saar. Buckel said that anyone who opposes Germany and has lived in the Saar for less than three years will be charged with treason if they remain in the Saar after it returns to Germany. Buckel also firmly stated that the German government sincerely wishes to not investigate the past. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Saarbrücken, the Saar Governing Commission has asked Prince Hubertus, a well-known anti-Nazi, to leave the country within 48 hours because his passport and other documents do not comply with regulations. Also, according to a dispatch from Paris, the French Minister of the Interior has instructed county magistrates and mayors across the country to prepare to receive Saar immigrants, to prevent a majority of voters advocating for belonging to Germany in the plebiscite on January 13. Judging from the current situation, the outcome of the plebiscite will be unfavorable to France. Paris now believes that if the Saar returns to Germany, about 30,000 residents of the region will wish to immigrate to France. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken The Saar Regional Plebiscite Commission will announce the rules for the Saar Regional Plebiscite on January 13 tomorrow, and will also explain the support for maintaining the status quo and continuing the League of Nations' administration in light of the voting results. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the plebiscite can choose from (1) merger with Germany, (2) merger with France, and (3) maintaining the status quo. After the League of Nations Council meeting in December, it was decided that if the majority supports maintaining the status quo, the situation can change in the future, and the people of the Saar can still hold another plebiscite to determine their sovereignty. This is still not in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. This explanation will be made public for the first time in tomorrow's announcement. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Economic Development Program for the British Empire and Dominions</h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Anniversary of the British Monarch's Accession</p>
<p>Leaders Will Gather in London to Negotiate Agreements</p>
<p>(London) King George V ascended the throne on May 10, 1910. This year is the 25th anniversary of his accession. Political leaders from the British Empire's overseas dominions and colonies will come to London to offer their congratulations. After the celebration ceremonies, the British government will take the opportunity to consult with the leaders of the dominions and colonies to establish a public agreement for all parts of the Empire and to promulgate a large-scale program to develop the Empire's economy. The main point of this program is to lend funds at low interest rates so that the various parts of the Empire can use them to operate large-scale public works. However, there is one condition for this loan: to the greatest extent possible, the largest part must be used to purchase British industrial products. The British people will be refreshed by this generous move by the government. At that time, the government will take advantage of this opportunity to hold a general election early. This general election will be held under the banner of the British Empire and will be called the (British Empire Flag Election), which can be said to be truly worthy of its name.

<h3>Inside Story of the Major Bribery Scandal in Japan (Japan News)</h3>
<p>Political Parties Greatly Influenced</p>
<p>Financial Circles Feel Immense Difficulty</p>
<p>In recent years in Japan, alongside the prevalence of extraordinary times, cases of bribery and corruption have emerged one after another. Among the major cases, the Ministry of Finance incident is the most prominent. This case involves Finance Vice-Minister Hideo Kuroda, Banking Bureau Director Teiji Okubo, and implicates former Railway President Chuzo Mitsuchi, Commerce and Industry Minister Baron Hisamankichi Nakajima, and numerous other influential figures in banking and business circles. The Saito Cabinet was even attacked by the Diet because of this, and with cabinet members being implicated in dishonorable matters, the cabinet consequently collapsed.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the occurrence of this incident, it originated from the Bank of Taiwan extending loans to Suzuki &amp; Co. Since the end of the World War, the company had been affected by the unfavorable economic situation, making it difficult to continue operations. The loans it borrowed from the Bank of Taiwan became impossible to repay. At that time, the Bank of Taiwan also engaged in excessively lenient lending, resulting in 350 million in loans that could not be recovered as scheduled. Consequently, except for its branches on Taiwan Island and overseas that were barely maintained, the bank temporarily suspended operations in Japan. Subsequently, the Bank of Japan stepped in to maintain and rescue it, providing accommodation of over 100 million in cash, allowing it to reopen. The stocks of various businesses operated by Suzuki &amp; Co., held by the Bank of Taiwan, mostly entered the Bank of Japan's treasury and were managed by the Bank of Japan. Among them was the stock of Teikoku Rayon Co., Ltd. After 1932, Japan's light industry developed upward, exports of cotton cloth gradually increased, and rayon fabrics became even more prosperous. Teikoku Rayon benefited equally, and its business suddenly flourished. Not only did it have no inventory, but its output for two or three months was already fully booked. As a result, the company's stock gradually soared, reaching more than twice the par value.</p>
<p>At that time, Bank of Taiwan President Shigeru Shimada, seeing the great profit at hand, was unwilling to give it up. He secretly conspired with Teikoku Rayon President Fukuko Takagi, Director Akira Okazaki, and Auditor Yoshinari Kawai to discuss how to bypass the Ministry of Finance and deceive the Bank of Japan, preparing funds to take 100,000 shares of Teikoku Rayon stock from the bank and sell them in Tokyo and Osaka, to divide the profits. At that time, it was also agreed to increase the company's dividend distribution for the second half of last year by 3 percent. The company's stock then soared even higher, approaching a market price of 200 yen per share, while the selling price was only 125 yen per share. The Bank of Taiwan's losses from this were estimated to be over 12 million yen.</p>
<p>After Shimada and others finalized their plan, they proceeded separately to take out the stock and sell it. Furthermore, since the stock involved numbered about several hundred thousand shares, and the funds involved were over ten million, the turnover became a problem. For those who mediated, they could not be rewarded with cash. Therefore, they proposed 1,300 shares of Teikoku Rayon stock to reward those involved. According to reports, former Vice-Minister of Finance Hideo Kuroda received 400 shares (market value slightly over 60,000 yen), former Railway President Chuzo Mitsuchi 300 shares (approximately 45,000 yen), former Commerce and Industry Minister Hisamankichi Nakajima 200 shares (valued at 30,000 yen), and former Banking Bureau Director Teiji Okubo 100 shares (valued at 15,000 yen). Such distribution amounted to only 2 percent of the huge profit of over 10 million yen. Both Chuzo Mitsuchi and Hisamankichi Nakajima were famous figures of their time and key figures in the Seiyukai political party, while Kuroda was also a top choice in the Ministry of Finance. It is unexpected that they would all be suspected of bribery today, which is quite surprising to the world. However, Mitsuchi still does not admit to accepting bribes and cites facts, stating that he absolutely did not accept the stock or exchange it for cash, and even points out the errors in the dates cited by the Tokyo District Court, to clarify that he has no involvement. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has also publicly stated that those implicated in the Ministry will definitely not accept bribes, and that the truth will come to light in the future. This has further raised a major issue, namely, confessions obtained through torture during preliminary hearings, forcing the defendants to fabricate facts. Extrapolating to this point, the sanctity of judicial power and the trampling of humanity have become a major issue. In short, this matter has a great bearing on Japan's political future. If the court's investigation is confirmed, the political world will suffer unprecedented infamy. If Mitsuchi and others' denials prove to be correct, then the spirit of the judiciary will also be swept away. Which of the two is true remains to be proven by future facts. (December 28, Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Elements of the Minbian Mutiny Arrested</h3>
<p>Provincial Party Headquarters Promulgates Measures for Communist Surrender</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, the authorities have been paying close attention to the actions of those involved in last year's Minbian Mutiny. Huang Wan was arrested in Fuzhou, and Zhang Shengcai was arrested in Xiamen. Huang had served as a member of the Economic Committee of the Provisional People's Government. After the failure, he fled to Hong Kong and recently sneaked back to Fuzhou. The special task force of the Provincial Party Headquarters discovered this and arrested him, detaining him at the Provincial Party Headquarters. Zhang had served as the chairman of the Xiamen Cultural Movement Grand Alliance and announced his separation from the Kuomintang. He was recently arrested by the Xiamen Public Security Bureau and sent to the province, detained at the Military Law Section of the Security Office. However, both Huang and Zhang have considerable status in society, so many people from various circles are running around trying to rescue them. It is reported that the authorities have telegraphed the Central Government, requesting instructions on how to handle the matter. In addition, in Putian and Lianjiang, several Communist Party offenders have also been arrested recently and sent to the Security Office for interrogation. Regarding the surrender of Communists, since the establishment of the Communist Party Surrender Review Committee, the Commissioner's Office of the Provincial Party Headquarters has formulated nine articles of measures for accepting the surrender of Communists. From now on, all surrenders of Communists in this province should be applied for directly to the office in accordance with the law. All Communist Party surrender cases accepted by various political, military, and police agencies, regardless of whether they have been reviewed, should also have the original files transferred to the office for review by the Review Committee or for filing. The contents of the measures are explored and recorded below. Article 1: This office formulates these measures in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Communist Party Surrender Law to accept Communist Party surrender cases.

If the aforementioned items cannot be written by oneself, a person may be commissioned to write on their behalf. The surrendering person should affix their fingerprint and the writing agent should sign and affix their seal. Article 4: The aforementioned surrender application should be submitted to this office along with three recent 4-inch half-length photos of the surrendering person for review by the Communist Party Surrender Case Review Committee. The aforementioned Review Committee shall be organized by one representative each from the Fujian Provincial Government, the High Court, the Security Office, the Fuzhou Garrison Headquarters, the Military Police Regiment, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, and this office, with the representative of this office serving as a standing committee member. Article 5: Upon receiving the aforementioned surrender application, the Review Committee shall immediately dispatch personnel or recommend personnel to investigate, and invite the surrendering person to fill out a registration form and a guarantee. The aforementioned guarantee must be signed and sealed by three party members of this party and three citizens of this province with legitimate occupations. Article 6: After the Review Committee deliberates and decides on the surrender case, it shall send the case along with its review opinions to the Security Office or the competent court for adjudication. For serious cases or cases where the surrender is not sincere, the surrendering person may be sent along with the case. Article 7: The competent court authorities shall notify the Review Committee after handling the surrender case so that it can be reported to the Central Government. Article 8: Matters not stipulated in these measures shall be handled in accordance with the Communist Party Surrender Law and its related criminal laws.

<h3>Second Phase of Rural Cooperative Work Completed in Henan Province</h3>
<p>Trial Implementation in Twenty-Seven Counties, Seven Hundred Societies Established</p>
<p>Loans Issued Nearly 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The rural cooperative movement in Henan Province, since the establishment of the committee in April last year, has completed the second phase of work by the end of last year. Twenty-seven counties have been selected for trial implementation, and more than 700 cooperative societies have been established, with loans issued reaching 400,000 yuan. The details are recorded as follows: Zhang Jingyu and Wu Jing were commissioned by the Nanchang Headquarters as members of the Henan Rural Cooperative Committee in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933-1934), and Zhang was appointed as chairman and Wu as general manager. They actively prepared and formally established the cooperative committee in April of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934-1935), assigning more than 60 people trained in Jiangxi, including Fan Zhi, to serve as instructors. Initially, only Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, Anyang, Huixian, Xinxiang, Luoyang, Shaanzhou, Saishan, Xuchang, Yuxian, Nanyang, Runan, Huaiyang, and other fourteen counties were designated as trial counties. After several months of promotion, the results were quite good. Subsequently, as the committee affairs became increasingly complex, Xu Qinglan was added as a committee member and general inspector through the approval of the headquarters. By the end of the first phase of work at the end of August, the cooperative societies established in various counties had reached over 200. Since the start of the second phase of work, there has been even greater progress than before. The trial counties have successively increased to include Guangwu, Rongyang, Huaxian, Qinyang, Xiangcheng, Zhenping, Yuanyang, Xinzheng, Mixian, Lanfeng, Mengxian, and Mianchi, and other thirteen counties. The method of organizing cooperative societies begins with publicity and investigation, first teaching farmers simple cooperative knowledge, making them clearly understand the benefits of cooperation, and voluntarily forming societies, then guiding them to handle the establishment procedures and operate their businesses. Therefore, they have repeatedly received commendations from the headquarters. Currently, the 27 trial counties have established more than 700 cooperative societies, and the total amount of loans granted to various cooperative societies is nearly 400,000 yuan, most of which is supplied by the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, and there is also investment from the Tianjin China Bank. The association has also cooperated with the Agricultural College of Henan University, with the Agricultural College handing over successfully tested wheat seeds to the association for distribution to the utilization cooperative societies under its guidance for planting, in order to promote and strive for widespread adoption. Recently, a technical design committee has been organized, inviting Wang Jinwu, president of the Agricultural College of Henan University, professors Li Xianwen, Lin Shize, Xu Zhenying, and Liu Wenbin and Xu Baikui, section chiefs of the Construction Department, to serve as committee members, planning to improve the cooperative society's products, animal husbandry, and the construction of agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects. This year, it is planned to hold large-scale warehouses in Shaanzhou, Lingbao, Yuanyang, Luoyang, and other cotton-producing areas to handle storage, mortgage, transportation, and sales, so as to prevent farmers from being exploited by unscrupulous merchants.

<h3>Bombing Cases in Guangzhou City During the Year-End Season</h3>
<p>Bomb Explodes at White Cloud Hotel, East Window</p>
<p>One Hotel Employee Injured on the Spot</p>
<p>Two Threatening Letters Reported Together</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the division of Guangdong Province for pacification, the leading bandits in various places have successively disappeared or fled overseas, while scattered small groups still lurk and commit petty crimes from time to time. As the year-end season approaches, the bold and fierce are out extorting money, and boatmen have been repeatedly threatened. Therefore, since winter, joint shipping on various river ferries has implemented self-defense. Initially, only those in the shipping industry were wary, but recently, the rampant activity has become even worse, and they are even extorting money from large hotels in the city center, where military and police are stationed. When extortion fails, they throw bombs to harass them. This is truly blatant and without any scruples. Previously, the White Cloud Hotel on Guangzhou's Changdi, a large and well-regarded hotel with seven or eight floors standing tall on the riverbank, offering both dining and lodging, had been attracting crowds of customers every day since its opening in July of this year, attracting the attention of bandits. A letter, signed by the leader He Duan of the West River Flying Dragon Hall bandit gang, was sent, stating that the brothers were suffering from a lack of food and were asking the hotel for a loan of 1,000 yuan. Mr. Lu, the manager of the hotel's dining department, considered bandit extortion to be commonplace and ignored it. More than a month later, on the 27th of this month, a second threatening letter was received, with many threatening words, roughly stating that the previous request for a loan of 1,000 yuan had not been fulfilled as scheduled and that this was a reminder, limiting them to paying the loan immediately, otherwise they would be dealt with severely. The manager also laughed it off. Unexpectedly, on that day, as the hotel's dining department was closing, customers were leaving one after another, and the staff were sweeping up. Suddenly, in guest seat No. 16 in the east corner, a cigarette pack was spotted. Hotel employee Yu Bin picked it up and examined it, seeing that there were still cigarettes inside and something heavy. Knowing that something was wrong, he quickly threw the cigarette pack out the window. The cigarette pack hit the window post and exploded with a loud bang. Iron filings flew everywhere. Everyone knew it was the sound of a bomb and rushed forward to rescue. At that time, Yu Bin had already fallen to the ground, and thick smoke filled the room. A window was destroyed. Police detectives rushed to the scene to investigate, searching nearby pedestrians, but found no suspicious figures. It was suspected that the bomb had been pre-placed by the bandits, waiting for a hotel employee to pick it up, triggering the explosion. After inspection, the police detectives determined that it was undoubtedly placed by bandits and sent the injured hotel employee Yu Bin to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. At the same time, manager Lu Yiqing also reported the bombing to the Jinghai Public Security Bureau, along with the two previous threatening letters received from the bandits, requesting a swift resolution to the case and the arrest of the culprits, in order to maintain commerce. As for the injured Yu Bin, after being sent to the hospital, the doctor bandaged the wound on his left shoulder. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured and was discharged from the hospital after pain relief to recuperate at home. (December 30)</p>

<h3>Five Representatives from Silver and Money Industries Visited the Director of the Currency Department Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Permission for Free Transport of Cash in the Interior</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, due to the Ministry of Finance's regulations to prevent the export of silver, anyone transporting more than 1,000 silver dollars is required to obtain a passport.

On the 24th, a joint meeting of the executive committees of the Silver and Money Industries Associations was convened and decided to request the financial authorities to allow free transport of cash in non-port areas, as they are not related to exports.

<h3>After Resumption of Postal Service with Northeast China, Postal Rates Remain the Same as Before</h3>
<p>Same as for Other Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>The issue of resuming postal service with Northeast China has been resolved. Mail to and from the four northeastern provinces will begin to be accepted starting on the 10th of this month. Regarding postal rates, a reporter learned from reliable sources yesterday that all postal fees for mail to the four northeastern provinces will still be charged according to previous practices, the same as for other provinces and cities. It is also reported that negotiations on the exchange of mail between inside and outside the customs have lasted for several months, repeatedly bordering on breakdown and were extremely difficult. The entire process involved technical solutions that did not involve signing or exchanging documents. The measures clearly stated that they did not involve political relations and were conducted under the principle of not recognizing the puppet regime. The representatives from the Kwantung Army involved in these negotiations were Fujiwara, Shibayama, and Iga, while the representatives from the Post Office were Gao Yu, Yin Li, and others. Mail to Europe via Siberia will also be handled as before.</p>

His meeting with President Wang will take place in Shanghai. Although the exact date of President Wang's arrival in Shanghai has not been determined, he is expected to come to Shanghai in the coming days. His future itinerary will be decided after meeting with President Sun Zhesheng of the Legislative Yuan, who is returning to Shanghai from Beiping. Mr. Hu Zhentang has sent him letters and telegrams. As for his departure date, it will also be determined after meeting with President Sun. The Hague International Court has long been granted an extension of leave, so his return date is around the middle of this month. The Conte Rosso, sailing from Shanghai to Italy, is scheduled to depart on the 15th. By then, all matters should be settled, and he will depart on that ship. In short, all matters will be decided after President Sun returns south.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Thoroughly Investigating Fairwind Anchoring Incident</h3>
<p>Nearly Collided with Stone Embankment</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Fairwind vessel arrived at Laoyao, Haizhou, on the 27th of last month to load cargo. Because the Yongji and Tonghua vessels were docked at the wharf, the Fairwind was unable to dock and anchored outside the wave-breaking embankment near the foot of Malian Mountain in Lianyungang, waiting for the Yongji and others to leave before moving to the wharf. Unexpectedly, the waves were quite large that night, and the ship was hit by the waves. It drifted while anchored in the middle of the night, and no one on board knew. It was not until 3:30 AM on the 28th that the Fairwind had drifted near the wave-breaking embankment, and the ship was about to collide with the stone embankment. The crew discovered this and quickly stopped the ship. However, it had already drifted more than a nautical mile. They immediately requested the Dutch harbor construction engineering office and Kang Zhengji from the Longhai Railway to dispatch tugboats to the location to tow the Fairwind back to its original anchoring point. After the Yongji and others left, it then docked at the wharf to load cargo. A telegram was received yesterday stating that the ship can return to Shanghai today. The company is now conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Measures for Revising the Tax on Ethyl Alcohol to a Unified Tax</h3>
<p>Implemented on January 1st of the 24th Year of the Republic</p>
<p>Beneficial to Both Commercial and Tax Revenue</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance considers ethyl alcohol to be an important industrial product. In the past, in order to prevent the blending of beverages, taxation was inevitably too high. Now, to alleviate business difficulties, ethyl alcohol will be subject to a unified tax. Provincial stamp tax and alcohol tax bureaus will stop collecting the tax, and the tax will be handled by unified tax agencies. This measure is beneficial to both commercial and tax revenue. The ministry yesterday instructed the Tax Affairs Department to publish and implement the Provisional Regulations for the Unified Tax on Ethyl Alcohol and the Collection Rules. The full text of the announcement and the regulations are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Official Proclamation</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, the collection of taxes on alcohol is handled by the provincial Stamp Tax Bureaus for Tobacco and Alcohol, in accordance with Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Taxes on Foreign Alcohol. The original tax rate, regardless of use, was set at twenty yuan per hundred catties for foreign alcohol. This was intended to prevent the adulteration of beverages and protect public health, but the tax rate was undeniably too high. Since the promulgation of regulations prohibiting alcohol adulteration, the harmful practice of adulterating beverages with alcohol can be expected to cease. The situation is different from before, and numerous merchants have repeatedly petitioned for a reduction in the tax rate. Considering the commercial situation in various regions and the current collection status, the Ministry of Finance recognizes that a change in the tax system is necessary. Because alcohol is related to industry and differs significantly from luxury goods, and because the original regulations stipulated collection from marketing stores, which led to disputes when taxes were paid and stamps affixed in one province and then transported to another, it is essential to differentiate based on use, appropriately reduce the tax rate, and implement a unified tax system. This is the only way to sympathize with merchants and benefit industry. Therefore, the Ministry has already drafted Provisional Regulations for the Unified Tax on Alcohol and Implementation Rules for Collection, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. The new regulations stipulate a tax rate of 13 cents in national currency per kilogram for ordinary alcohol. Assuming 4.545 kilograms per Imperial gallon, the tax is approximately 59 cents. Compared to the original tax rate of twenty yuan per hundred catties, this is equivalent to 26.3 cents per kilogram, a reduction of over half. For denatured alcohol used in industry, the tax is halved according to the customs import tax regulations, which is 6.5 cents in national currency per kilogram, a reduction of more than three-quarters compared to the old tax rate. All collection procedures will be handled by the unified tax authorities in each district. For alcohol manufactured domestically, the unified tax bureau in each district will dispatch personnel to the factory for collection. For imported alcohol, following the precedent for various unified taxes, the customs authorities will collect the unified tax in addition to the import duties at the currently established unified tax rate. Taxes will be uniformly levied based on the net packaged volume and stamps will be affixed. Alcohol that has completed the unified tax payment and has stamps affixed can be transported and sold in various provinces without being taxed again. The aforementioned revised measures will benefit both commerce and tax revenue. They are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1935. In addition to instructing the provincial Stamp Tax Bureaus for Tobacco and Alcohol and the unified tax bureaus in each district to cease collection and take over the new system on schedule, the Customs Administration is ordered to instruct the Inspector General of Customs to inform all customs offices to comply accordingly. This proclamation is hereby issued for general information. Hereafter, all merchants manufacturing alcohol domestically, whether in the interior or concessions, shall comply with the regulations and apply for registration with the local unified tax authorities to facilitate the dispatch of personnel to the factory for collection. Alcohol imported or manufactured before the implementation of the unified tax that has not been reported for foreign alcohol tax shall also be reported to the unified tax authorities for inspection and stamp affixing before it can be sold. Failure to report or concealment will be treated as tax evasion and punished according to regulations. This proclamation.</p>
<h3>Provisional Regulations</h3>
<p>Article 1: All alcohol manufactured domestically or imported from foreign countries shall comply with these regulations and pay the unified alcohol tax. Article 2: The unified alcohol tax is a central national tax, collected by the General Tax District Bureaus and Unified Tax Management Offices under the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. Article 3: The unified alcohol tax rate shall be divided into two categories, A and B: (A) Ordinary alcohol: 13 cents in national currency per liter; (B) Denatured alcohol and wood alcohol (including light coconut wine and fusel oil): 6.5 cents in national currency per liter. Article 4: All alcohol imported from foreign countries shall, in addition to import duties collected by the customs authorities, be subject to the unified tax at the rates specified in the preceding article. Article 5: Alcohol on which the unified tax has been paid may be transported and sold in various provinces and regions without being taxed again. Article 6: All alcohol on which the unified tax has been paid shall have sufficient stamps affixed. A transport permit shall also be obtained for transportation. Article 7: Detailed regulations regarding the collection procedures, registration, inspection, and penalties for the unified alcohol tax shall be established separately. Article 8: These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>The Kincheng Banking Corporation Suspended Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Affected by the Inability of the Hong Kong Head Office to Sustain Operations</p>
<p>Whether Operations Will Resume Awaits a Reply from the Head Office</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Kincheng Banking Corporation at 300 Beijing Road, originally a branch of the Hong Kong Kincheng Savings Bank, suspended operations yesterday after receiving a telegram from its head office stating that it was unable to sustain operations and had ceased operations. The bank's permanent legal counsel, Lawyer Song Yunhui, issued a notice announcing the temporary suspension of operations, pending instructions from the head office, after which a decision would be made to liquidate or continue operations. According to a person in charge of Lawyer Song's firm, the branch has been established for approximately three years with a capital of 200,000 yuan. The manager is Tan Huiqing and the deputy manager and treasurer is Bai Hongji. Daily operations have been relatively stable. Currently, due to the closure of the head office, the branch has no way to operate independently, so suspension is inevitable. However, assets and liabilities are certain to offset each other. The lawyer's notice and the bank's history are detailed below:</p>
<h3>Lawyer's Notice</h3>
<p>Lawyer Song Yunhui's Agency Notice: According to the representative of the Shanghai Branch Co., Ltd. of Kincheng Banking Corporation, a telegram was suddenly received from the Hong Kong head office stating that the head office, being unable to maintain operations, has ceased operations. As to whether this branch should also cease operations, aside from seeking instructions from the head office, operations will be temporarily suspended today pending a reply. Please have your esteemed firm issue a notice on our behalf. Hence, this notice is issued on their behalf as above. January 5, 1935, Song Yunhui, Lawyer.</p>
<h3>Bank History</h3>
<p>The Kincheng Savings Bank Co., Ltd. was founded in Hong Kong in 1923 with a paid-up capital of one million Hong Kong dollars. In December 1924, it was registered with the Hong Kong government and also with the Ministry of Industry. The chairman is Feng Dachun, the supervisors are Huang Boyuan and Kuang Lesheng, and the general manager is Tan Xitian. It has two branches, one in Shanghai and one in Guangzhou. Recently, due to excessive investment in land mortgages, its cash flow was disrupted, forcing it to suspend operations. The Guangzhou branch has also suspended operations and is awaiting liquidation.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Explains Stamp Tax Still Applied as Before</h3>
<p>Although New Law is Promulgated, It Has Not Been Implemented</p>
<p>Although the new Stamp Tax Law has been amended and enacted by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government on December 8 last year, it has not yet been implemented. There has been much confusion in the city's business community, and many have inquired with the City Chamber of Commerce. According to a formal statement by Yan E'sheng, the secretary of the Chamber, although the new law has been promulgated, according to the final article of the law, the date of implementation will be determined by order. As the implementation date has not yet arrived, all bills and account books should still be stamped in accordance with the existing Stamp Tax Regulations. Once the National Government formally orders the implementation of the new law in the future, the Chamber will formally announce compliance. The Commercial Monthly Report of the Chamber previously compiled and printed a "Question and Answer Guide to Stamp Tax," which was sold at the office of the Monthly Report and was not distributed outside by staff. Since the formulation of the new Stamp Tax Law, the Chamber has not received the original text of the new law, so there have been no publications on the subject. Any publications being distributed outside are counterfeit and should be handed over to the police. Such counterfeit publications are bound to contain many errors, and if followed, will inevitably cause problems.</p>

<h3>Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry Plans This Year's Fisheries Protection Plan</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Categories: Regular Patrol, Roving, and Escort</p>
<p>Patrolling Vessels Responsible for Preventing Foreign Vessel Encroachment</p>
<p>The Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry has drafted an outline of this year's fisheries protection plan and submitted it to the Ministry for review. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency has obtained the original text as follows:</p>
<p>Fishing Area Under Jurisdiction This office was reorganized from the Jiangzhe Area Marine Fisheries Administration, so the fishing area under its jurisdiction is temporarily limited to the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, due to the small number of patrol vessels in this office, allocation is often difficult, and there is a tendency to focus on one area and neglect others. In May last year, a joint defense conference was held with the Coastal Patrol Office of the Ministry of Navy, the Third District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Force, and the Second Brigade of the Zhejiang Water Police. It was decided that each area would be responsible for a section. The patrol locations assigned to this office are divided into three zones: (1) Waters such as Shenjiamen, Zhujia Island, Donghuoshan, Erxiongdi, Langgang, Haijiao, and Shenshan; (2) Waters such as Sheshan, Luohua (Lvhua), Huadao Mountain, Huanglong, Maji, Sijiao, and Beitingshan (Beidingxin); (3) Waters such as Zhoushan, Daishan, Changtu, Qushan, Qingbang, Miaozi Lake, and Daji Mountain.</p>
<p>Fishing Season The fishing season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang can be divided into spring, autumn, and winter seasons. According to the type of fish and the time and location of production, the main types can be divided into: (1) Large yellow croaker: Qushan, Daji Yang, Daishan, Huangda Yang, from the vernal equinox to the minor heat (most abundant from Grain Rain to the Start of Summer; also present in autumn); (2) Small yellow croaker: Lvsi Yang, Shenshan, Taohua, Huadao, Sheshan, Langgang, Lvhua, from the end of winter to the beginning of spring, from the vernal equinox to the start of summer; (3) Ribbonfish: Haijiao, Shenshan, Huadao, Langgang, Erxiongdi, Dinghai, Changtu, from minor snow to major snow; (4) Cuttlefish: Shenshan, Qingbang, Miaozi Lake, Huangxing, Taizhou Islands, from February to June; (5) Reevess shad: Zhoushan Islands, Lvsi Yang, from Pure Brightness to Major Heat; (6) Jellyfish: Sijiao, Huanglong, present in all seasons, more abundant in spring; (7) Horse mackerel: Lvsi Yang, ten days before the Start of Summer to late May. The fishing seasons mentioned above refer to the most prominent species. In reality, fishing continues throughout the year, with only differences in peak and off-peak seasons.</p>
<p>Regular Patrol This office currently has five patrol vessels, which are barely sufficient for fisheries protection. The fisheries protection measures are divided into regular patrol, roving, and escort, which will be carried out simultaneously. Regular patrol will be conducted on a district basis during normal times and on a fishing ground basis during the fishing season. The patrol measures are as follows: (1) One patrol vessel will be assigned to each fishing area for regular patrol; (2) During the peak fishing season, patrol vessels will regularly patrol the fishing grounds; (3) Patrol vessels will be responsible for all security matters within the fishing area and fishing ground and shall not leave unless absolutely necessary; (4) Patrol vessels will only be responsible for protecting fishing operations. The escort of fishing boats will be handled by another patrol vessel; (5) If foreign vessels are found encroaching on fishing grounds, measures should be taken to stop them according to the situation, or the incident should be reported to this office for submission to the Ministry of Industry for review and handling.</p>
<p>Roving and Escort Although each fishing area has a patrol vessel for regular patrol, the fishing areas are vast, and there are concerns that some areas may not be adequately covered. Moreover, the patrol vessels of this office are not equipped with radio stations, which is inconvenient for communication. Therefore, two patrol vessels will be assigned to roving and escort duties. The measures are as follows: (1) The roving area will be temporarily limited to the area from Lvsi Yang in the north to Wenzhou Bay in the south; (2) Roving patrol vessels will be responsible for communication duties for the patrol vessels; (3) If the patrol vessel stationed in a fishing area leaves the fishing area due to necessary circumstances, the roving patrol vessel shall immediately take over the defense of the fishing area; (4) If a large fleet of fishing boats requests an escort due to full loads from fishing or purchasing, the roving patrol vessel shall consider the situation and report to this office for review and handling, or escort them immediately; (5) If foreign vessels are found encroaching on fishing grounds, measures should be taken to stop them according to the situation, or the incident should be reported to this office for submission to the Ministry of Industry for review and handling; (6) Fishing boats are prohibited from fishing in prohibited fishing areas.</p>
<p>Fisheries Survey The patrol vessels patrolling each fishing area are instructed to conduct a detailed survey of the local fisheries and report it to this office for reference. The survey items for each patrol vessel are as follows: (1) Name of the fishing area; (2) Location of the fishing ground; (3) Number of fishing boats; (4) Types of fishing boats; (5) Types of fish products; (6) Estimated value of catches; (7) Fishing time; (8) Sales market; (9) General living conditions of fishermen; (10) General conditions of the fishermen's association (or office); (11) Security conditions of the fishing ground.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Land Consolidation Conference</h3>
<p>Discussing the Width of River Courses in Each District</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Land Consolidation Discussion Committee held its seventh meeting yesterday, chaired by Pan Zhongjia. Matters for discussion: (1) Review of the proposed widths of river courses in the Fifth District. Resolution: The county should dispatch eight surveyors to measure the Zhoupu Tang. For the remaining rivers and streams, the heads of each township in the district should be jointly surveyed at the same time as the Zhoupu Tang is measured, and detailed widths should be proposed for review. (2) Should districts that have not proposed widths of river courses be uniformly urged to do so? Resolution: The original resolution to urge each district to submit proposals for review remains in effect. (3) Should the river area of already measured widths be transferred to the land survey team? Resolution: The land survey team should still be instructed to draw a dotted line according to the determined width and separately calculate and report the area of the riverbed and road surface.</p>
<h3>The Mingshing to Set Sail on Maiden Voyage on the 9th</h3>
<p>Operating on the Three Seas Route</p>
<p>The Lianhe, purchased from Jardine Matheson by the Sanbei Company, has undergone major repairs in the factory since its acquisition. First, second, and third class passenger berths have been added. Construction has taken over three months. The ship's dining room, staterooms, and other facilities have been completely renovated, beautifully decorated, and are even better than the Yongxing. It has been renamed the Mingshing. The ship has a tonnage of 2,770 tons, a registered tonnage of 1,588 tons, a length of 278 feet 2 inches, a width of 42 feet 9 inches, and a horsepower of 1,000. It can travel 10.75 nautical miles per hour. The ship was built by the French CAITLARD &amp; CO. factory in Harfleur. The renovation is now complete, and it can leave the factory on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Wharf Completion</h3>
<p>Sanbei purchased land in Zhenhai and built a new wharf and warehouse at a cost of 100,000 yuan to operate this new route. Construction began last autumn. The wharf is adjacent to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhenhai wharf. At the time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was concerned that the turning of ships would be hindered and negotiated with Sanbei. Later, as there was no hindrance, Sanbei was able to proceed with construction as planned. It is now completed.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu's Inspection</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, general manager of Sanbei, went to Ningbo during the New Year's holiday to inspect the new wharf and warehouse in Zhenhai, a port that is of great importance to the operation of the Mingshing's Three Seas route (Shanghai, Zhenhai, Dinghai). He also met with the managers of Ningbo to discuss plans for the new ship's operation. Mr. Yu has now returned to Shanghai after completing his business.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Voyage</h3>
<p>After the Mingshing's renovation, the company reported it to the Maritime Administration and the Customs for registration, changed the national flag, ship flag, and crew, which are being assigned. It is expected to be determined in the next day or two and orders will be issued to the ship. The tea boy and middle cabin staff have all been internally appointed. The Mingshing's inaugural voyage will be to Zhenhai and Dinghai, and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the first time on the 9th of this month.</p>

<h3>Two Philanthropists Generously Donate to Drought Relief</h3>
<p>The Drought Relief Association of Various Provinces recently received a letter from Yongwei Zhuren stating that the drought in various provinces this year is severe and tragic. Sympathizing with the situation, but lacking the ability to provide relief, they have frugally saved up one thousand yuan in foreign currency and sent it to be entrusted to those in charge of the relief effort to distribute to those in urgent need. Every little bit helps. They have each done their best, and so on. They also received a letter from Mr. Shen Lu, a renowned professor at Tsinghua University in Beiping, stating that relatives and friends have donated funeral expenses to help relieve the drought in memory of his late mother, Madam Li. The first batch of 622 yuan in silver dollars has been remitted through the Continental Bank. Please allocate it to the disaster relief effort in the provinces affected by the severe drought. Please check and fill in the receipts for the list of donations from relatives and friends, and remit the remaining amount when collected to benefit the disaster-stricken people, and so on. Yongwei Zhuren has anonymously contributed to the relief effort, generously donating with no desire for recognition. Mr. Shen Lu has contributed funeral expenses for his mother, demonstrating filial piety and a deep charitable spirit, especially praiseworthy. The world has examples of filial piety and righteousness displayed by relatives who help others. Emulating their noble conduct, people will surely be willing to do what is right.</p>

<h3>Lawyers' Association Jointly Disputes Notification and Delivery Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association received a letter from the Tianjin Lawyers' Association yesterday, stating: "In response to the telegraph from the Wuhan Lawyers' Association, which stated that the Hubei Higher Court issued an order, forwarded from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, regarding the use of summonses and the collection of delivery fees for lawyers appearing in court, this association believes that this is a matter of principle and lacks legal basis, and has filed a petition with the ministry to strongly argue against it. We hope that you will all stand together." Upon receiving this letter, it was immediately submitted to the Standing Councilors' Meeting for discussion. The councilors agreed that, according to Article 44 of the Wuhan Lawyers' Association's charter, approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs ("The court shall use official letters to notify lawyers to appear in court"), and the supplementary judicial regulations, the charters of the Anhui Huaining, Jiangxi Ganxian, Hunan Shaoyang, and Zhejiang Yongjia Lawyers' Associations also contain the phrase "The court shall use official letters to notify lawyers to appear in court." It is clear that official letters and summonses are two different documents, with different forms and natures. Article 158 of the Civil Procedure Law states that a party's appointment of a litigation agent is based on their professional conduct and is not comparable to a party. Receiving a notice from the court is different from the court directly delivering a document to a party. The collection of fees lacks legal basis and there is no precedent for it. It was unanimously resolved to jointly contact the lawyers' associations of various provinces and request the Lawyers' Association of the Republic of China to negotiate with the ministry to strongly argue against it. We hereby inform you for your reference and hope that you will all stand together to achieve the goal of withdrawing the order to uphold the dignity of the legal profession."</p>

At 8:30 p.m. on December 19th of last year, Liu returned home from work and caught He in the room. The two began to quarrel, and He insulted and cursed Liu. In a fit of anger, Liu struck He in the temple with a small iron hammer, causing a fatal injury before medical treatment could be administered. After the incident, the French police sent detectives to arrest Liu. He's widow, He Gengshi, accused Liu of murdering for money. The police sent Liu to the Special Court No. 2, where the lawyer representing the police department charged him with the crime of causing death by injury. He Gengshi also filed an incidental private lawsuit, seeking damages of over 10,000 yuan. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo held several court sessions, gathering witnesses and evidence for investigation, and appointed lawyer Yang Shaopeng to defend the defendant, he announced the conclusion and instructed the parties to wait for a scheduled sentencing.

After the sentencing, the defendant was transferred to the detention center to await instructions during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Failure to Collect Fisheries Construction Fee, Dai Yongtang Accused of Ignoring Funds</h3>
<p>Dai Yongtang, a native of Ningbo, was appointed as the Director-General of the Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Association in May of last year. At that time, the Ministry of Industry approved the request from the Fisheries Improvement Committee under the Fisheries Administration to establish a Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to collect fisheries construction fees from fishermen in the two provinces. Dai Yongtang then secured the position of Director of the Collection Office. However, shortly after its establishment, it was met with opposition from the industry, and Minister Chen ordered the collection to be stopped. Nevertheless, Dai Yongtang had already spent a considerable amount of money. Now, the creditor, Jin Gengyao, has hired a lawyer to sue Dai Yongtang in the District Court for failing to pay the funds, requesting the court to summon him for interrogation and recovery. After receiving the complaint, the court issued a summons the day before, but Dai did not appear. It was ordered that the summons be extended for another hearing and investigation.</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Morphine Seized from Passengers on Datong Steamer</h3>
<p>Fake West Lake Lotus Root Powder</p>
<p>Yi Qiusheng Bribery Case Transferred to Bureau</p>
<p>Chen Zhirong and other police officers of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, at around 12 o'clock the night before last, saw the Datong steamer docked at the Wangjia Wharf. Not yet set to sail, they boarded the ship to inspect the passengers. They noticed two large paper packages and a hand-carried leather suitcase placed near a berth in the third-class cabin, which appeared suspicious. They used an iron rod to pierce into the packages for testing and detected the smell of narcotics. After opening the two paper packages one by one, they found that the top layer contained soft candies, chewing gum, and other sweets. Upon closer inspection, they discovered six large packages of narcotic powder attached underneath, weighing about ninety taels. There were also seven paper boxes of West Lake Lotus Root Powder produced by Taikang Company, but inside were seven large packages of morphine, weighing about eighty taels, worth several thousand yuan. The two ends of the packages were stamped with the fire lacquer seal of Yun Sen Shen Zhuang. Upon opening another leather suitcase, two flannel shirts and a pair of galoshes were found inside. They asked the tea server on the ship about the owner of the items. According to the tea server, the berth was reserved by a Zhenjiang customer, and the paper packages and leather suitcase were also brought by the customer, but the customer had gone ashore for some business. The police officers rewrapped the seized drugs, put them back in their original place, and waited for a long time until the customer arrived. They immediately arrested him. Unexpectedly, the customer suddenly took out twenty-two silver dollars to bribe them, begging to be spared arrest. The police officers brought the bribe money along with the seized evidence back to the team. During the preliminary hearing by Chief Zhu, the suspect identified himself as Yi Qiusheng, 32 years old, a native of Zhenjiang. He had previously opened a cigarette and paper shop outside the South Gate of Tongzhou. He claimed that the drugs did not belong to him and that he had offered the bribe in desperation during the police inspection. Considering the case involved smuggling a large quantity of drugs, it was ordered to prepare a document and submit it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation and punishment yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Westerner Drives Drunk and Runs Over Wang Aji, Breaking His Leg</h3>

<h3>Route One Public Bus to Add Double-Decker Buses</h3>
<p>Until the end of July this year</p>
<p>The number will increase to 24</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports: According to Mr. Xu Te, engineer and traffic manager of the British Public Bus Company, two double-decker buses on Route 1 from Edinburgh Road to Hongkou Park will operate within the next week. In the following months, these new buses will be gradually increased. By the end of July this year, there will be as many as 24 double-decker buses on this route. Thus, a bus can pass every three and a half to four minutes, which should slightly ease traffic on this busy route. As for other routes in the concession, due to the need to pass over wooden bridges, narrow roads, and inconvenient turns, it seems unlikely that this type of new bus will be implemented for the time being.</p>
<h3>Morphine Manufacturing Operation Found in English Home on Anhe Temple Road After Fire</h3>
<p>English Woman Obstructed Inspection, Arousing Suspicion</p>
<p>Secret Revealed After Investigation</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports: Carelessness in the servants' quarters of the home of English national Xiang Sheng at No. 361 Anhe Temple Road on Wednesday night led to a fire, which was extinguished by the fire brigade. A large-scale morphine manufacturing operation was discovered as a result. Xiang Sheng has already gone to England, so the Western detective of the Jing'an Temple Road Patrol Station detained Xiang Sheng's wife and handed her over to the British Consulate. Yesterday (the 4th) afternoon, police magistrate Morris ordered the woman to post bail of 2,000 yuan and temporarily released her, scheduling the trial for Wednesday morning next week. When the fire broke out that night, all the Chinese servants left the room and fled. Only Xiang Sheng's wife and her two children were left in the house. After the fire was extinguished, firefighters and police officers wanted to enter the main house for investigation, but were reportedly blocked, claiming that without a search warrant from the English authorities, they could not enter. The police officers became suspicious and entered the house for investigation, discovering a large amount of raw materials and morphine manufacturing equipment on the first floor. Therefore, Xiang Sheng's wife was arrested yesterday. Morris personally inspected the house last night. The house was rented from the Meihua Real Estate Company a month ago. The furnishings in the house are simple. It is now under police guard.</p>

No one was seen, only a wisp of white smoke. The smell of sulfur was pungent, and the doors and windows were destroyed in many places. They immediately reported to the owner, who then reported to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Station to send detectives to investigate. It was found that someone had thrown a bomb there. After a detailed investigation, they reported back to the police station to file the case and went out to investigate the matter. The inside story is difficult to guess for the time being.</p>
<h3>Fan-tan Gambling Den Cracked Down in Nanxun Road</h3>
<p>Principal Offender and Gamblers Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>Notorious gangster Zhao Asi (nickname "Little Tongzhou") has recently been gathering gamblers to gamble on a foreign merchant ship in Huangpu, using foreigners as a talisman to resist the arrest of the police authorities. Since the merchant ship recently set sail, Zhao and others had no choice but to rent No. 74 Nanxun Road, Hongkou, from Liu Hongfa to continue gambling at Fan-tan, etc. Every day, there were as many as 40 or 50 gamblers, and the rake-off was also several dozen gold. This was learned by detectives Wen Youheng and Zhu Mengwei of the Hongkou Patrol Station, who reported to the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. At 3:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, they rushed to arrest Zhao Asi, Liu Hongfa, and 34 gamblers including Zhang Zu, Tang Lizhou, Wu Youquan, Liu Agen, Xie Youdan, Lu Juncai, Lin Ayou, and Lu Yongqing, along with gambling money and tools, and took them all into custody at the patrol station. Yesterday morning, Police Station Lawyer Jiang Baolian of the First Special Court indicted them under Article 280 of the Criminal Law for assembling for gambling and collecting rake-offs. Subsequently, Chief Zhu testified that he saw Zhao acting as the dealer at the time, and the house was rented by Liu Hongfa.

<h3>Five or Six Gangsters Forcibly Abducted a Prostitute</h3>
<p>Hair Cutting in Barber Shop Interrupted</p>
<p>Mouths and Eyes of Supervising Maid Tied Up</p>
<p>Xu Jinkui, from Jiangbei, has been running a low-class brothel at No. 17 Maidian Road, Dongxingli, next to the Big Bell in the French Concession for many years, with many prostitutes and a thriving business. In mid-December of last year (lunar calendar), a woman surnamed Chen from Liyang pawned her 19-year-old daughter, Chen Xiaomei, to Xu as a prostitute for a term of three years, with an annual pawn fee of 70 yuan. Since then, a flawless girl has fallen into the filth, and a year has passed in the blink of an eye. However, at around 2 p.m. yesterday, Xiaomei suddenly told Xu that she wanted to go to the barber shop for a haircut. At that time, Xu ordered a maid to accompany her to the Jiangsu Barber Shop near the alleyway. Before the haircut was even half finished, five or six young men in disheveled clothing suddenly broke in from outside the door. Upon seeing Xiaomei, three or four of them dragged Xiaomei off the chair without asking questions. At the same time, two of them tied up the mouths and eyes of the accompanying maid to prevent her from making noise. In an instant, Xiaomei was dragged out of the door by three or four young men, through the Mingde Li alley next door, and into a car parked on Fire Wheel Mill Street. They drove away at full speed and disappeared without a trace.</p>

The factory roof was struck into a hole, and bricks and tiles flew everywhere. Three workers, Zhou Zhanglai, Feng Yunhong, and Feng Asan, were working below and could not escape in time. They were hit by falling bricks and tiles, causing blood to flow like a river.

He was instructed to hide the money in two baskets of charcoal and place them at his doorstep, otherwise, they would use drastic measures. After receiving the letters, Xu reported to Cheng Songlin and Zhang Zhongliang of the 16th Concession Detective Squad, who led detectives to lie in ambush near Xu's residence. Unexpectedly, at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, a man named Wang Asong from Da Chang went to Xu's house to collect the charcoal and was captured by the ambushing detectives Cheng and Zhang, taken to the Yimiao Police Station under their jurisdiction, and transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, Xu's house received another threatening letter the other evening, with half a receipt (with the word "Xu" split in half) attached. The letter still instructed him to put 2,000 silver dollars in two baskets of charcoal and place them at the doorstep. If someone brought the other half of the receipt to his house, he was asked to pay the money to the person presenting the receipt. Xu was deeply suspicious after receiving the letter and immediately reported to the detectives Cheng and Zhang for investigation. Then, at 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, a man resembling a porter, carrying a carrying pole and two ropes, along with a letter and half a receipt, came to Xu's house and asked to take away two baskets of charcoal. Xu took the letter and realized that the extortionists had openly come to carry away the charcoal. He detained the man and informed Detective Cheng, who arrested the man and took him to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. According to the interrogation by Chief Liu, the defendant identified himself as Yu Xinhuai, 23 years old, from Hai'an, a wharf porter living in Lotus Pond, Nanshi. A man wearing a gray serge overcoat, crystal glasses, and luxurious clothes on the wharf instructed him to take the letter and receipt to Xu's house to carry away two baskets of charcoal and wait for him in Maocheng Air Conditioning, 洋行街， at the Tilanqiao. The police immediately sent detectives to arrest him, but the man had already fled.

The notice is recorded below: "To whom it may concern: In recent years, floods and droughts have caused disasters, and Heaven has afflicted China. At a time when the country is in difficulty, the countryside is collapsing, and the social economy is in extreme panic, unfortunately, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were hit by drought last year. The disaster situation is particularly severe in eastern Zhejiang. The land is barren for thousands of miles, and there is almost no harvest. People are crying for food and shivering from the cold. The tragic scene is unprecedented. Mencius said, 'Compassion is in everyone's heart.' Can we not be generous to these disaster-stricken people who are crying for food? Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have always been known for their rich products, and the prosperity of various industries in Shanghai is also linked to this. Now that Zhejiang Province has suffered this unprecedented catastrophe, we cannot turn a blind eye and fail to seek ways to provide relief. The organizers of the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association have been deeply disturbed by the tragedy. In addition to making every effort to solicit donations from all walks of life, we also aim to gather every bit of help. We have specially joined hands with the Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Association to initiate the Shanghai National Goods Movement Commission-Based Charity Conference. A certain percentage of the participating manufacturers' business income will be donated to the disaster relief fund, which will serve to expand the promotion of national goods and seek to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people from the depths of water and fire. The method is good and the intention is kind, and it is truly a win-win situation. The vacant lot at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Min Ti Ni Yin Road has been designated as the venue, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for January 15th. Registration will begin immediately. We have always known that your factory's products are excellent and surpass imported goods, and you have spared no effort in the national goods movement. We hope that you will also be happy to agree to participate in this National Goods Movement Commission-Based Charity Conference to jointly support this good cause.</p>

<h3>Important Pamphlet from the International Problems Research Association</h3>
<p>(Verification of the Manchurian Incident) Published</p>
<p>The International Problems Research Association has recently published a pamphlet entitled (Verification of the Manchurian Incident), written by American Dolfman and published in the American (Harper's) magazine. The Association believes that the report's thorough investigation and precise verification make it an extremely important document on the Northeast Incident. The Lytton Report, while not believing in the incident, did not investigate it deeply, so the truth of the incident has not been officially ascertained. Dolfman's report is the first of its kind since September 18th. Since the Japanese side used the "incident" as a basis for exercising its so-called "legitimate self-defense" rights, the "incident" itself is the fundamental issue of the entire case. The conclusion of this article proves that the "incident" cannot be established, and therefore the Japanese military actions cannot be recognized as self-defense, let alone legitimate. The pamphlet costs 20 cents. Those who wish to read it can purchase it directly from the Association at No. 59, Hong Kong Road.</p>
<h3>Human Traffickers Convicted</h3>
<p>The five-year-old daughter, Fengying, of Li Lu, a woman from Tongzhou residing at No. 80, Lane 690, East Seward Road, disappeared suddenly at around 4 PM on the previous day. At the time, the other two Indians were promised jobs in about two weeks. A. Accasen and S. Wensen had no choice but to agree. Unexpectedly, on November 1st, A. Accasen and S. Wensen still had not been assigned jobs. When they negotiated with Li, the Da Mei Printing Bureau had already announced its closure. Helpless, Li replaced the security deposit receipts with IOUs. Two months have passed since then, and he has not paid back a single cent. The three Indians discovered that all the valuable items in the Da Mei Printing Bureau had been moved away. When they tried to negotiate with Li, he avoided them. At this point, the three Indians reported Li to the French police for fraudulently obtaining money and requested a formal investigation. The police chief approved the request and sent detectives Jiang Changwen and Yin Baoke to arrest Li Bin and send him to the Second Special District Court for questioning and investigation. The police investigation is now complete. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer prosecuted Li Bin for fraud. The plaintiffs then recounted the details of how they were deceived. The defendant, Li Bin, stated that his friend Shen Ronglu borrowed 700 yuan from the three plaintiffs, and he acted as the guarantor. He denied that the amount was as much as 1,400 yuan and denied committing fraud. After the court questioned both parties in detail, it determined that further investigation was necessary. The case was adjourned to the 9th of this month. The defendant was ordered to provide a 5,000 yuan surety, and was remanded in custody in the absence of a guarantor.</p>
<p>Shi Laosan, a native of Danyang who lived in the same residence, was highly suspected. When questioned, he claimed ignorance, and they argued with each other. At that moment, Chinese detective Zhang Youming and detective Huang Fugeng of the Huishan Police Station passed by and inquired about the situation. They took Shi to the police station for interrogation. Shi claimed that Li's daughter had been taken by his friend Zhu Rongkun to the home of Zhang Changsheng, a native of Anhui, at No. 45, Taiping Street, Pudong. The detectives rushed to Pudong, and together with the local police station, they arrested Zhang at the address. Zhang claimed that the girl was at the home of his friend Hua Qianer (a native of Ningbo) at No. 26, Xujiazhai. They then went to retrieve the girl and brought Hua, Zhang, and Shi back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The lawyer for the Public Works Department, Li Zhishan, gave a detailed account of the case's progress. Li Lu testified that her daughter had been abducted. After Judge Xiao Xieffen questioned the defendants and obtained clear confessions, Shi Laosan was sentenced to two years in prison, and Zhang Changsheng and Hua Qianer were each sentenced to six months. Hua's sentence was suspended for two years. Fengying was returned to Li Lu.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Ding Peitang, whose family has reported to us that they recently read in the news section of various newspapers on the 5th of this month about the heroin trafficking case cracked in Yunnan Road. The reports state that He Yixiang, Xu Yunlong, and others confessed that Ding Peitang was in charge, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Upon investigation, He Yixiang, also known as He Yuxiang, borrowed money in 1931 through the introduction of Ding Yunzhou and Ding Ruilin. Despite repeated requests, the debt was not repaid, and a lawsuit was filed with the First Special District Court to recover the debt. Now, because Peitang is currently away dealing with some matters, he has been maliciously framed. We have already telegraphed him to come to Shanghai to file a suit for defamation and clarify the truth. Therefore, we are requesting your newspaper to issue a correction to avoid misleading the public. Sincerely, Lawyer Shen Xuyuan. January 5, 1935.</p>

<h3>Shen Yuan Basketball Court Opens; Pirates Defeat National Sports Again</h3>
<p>27 to 23, Difference of Four Points</p>
<p>National Sports Team Leaves Shanghai This Morning to Return to Beijing</p>
<p>The newly built Shen Yuan Basketball Court opened at 7:15 PM last night. National Sports and Pirates met for the second time. There were only about 300 spectators. In yesterday's game, both teams were playing away, and the court was large, so the situation seemed very balanced. The Pirates did their best to play their game. In the first half, except for Pirates' Carlson and Smith, who took the lead 2-0 and 4-2 in the first three minutes of the game, the rest of the time National Sports led. However, Li Zhenzhong was guarded by the Pirate leader and could not move freely. The Zhang brothers, working together, took a commanding lead with 6-4 and 8-4. The Pirates panicked and fought hard, resulting in a tie of 11 points each at the end of the first half. In the second half, the Pirates changed their strategy, and the game improved. National Sports did not change its strategy, and the five-man defense failed. Li Zhenzhong's performance declined. The Pirates acted unscrupulously, making many hits with short throws and long shots. Among them, Smith, Shi Xian, and Lain were the most active. As a result, the Pirates won the second victory with a score of 27 to 23.</p>

<p>Jakob and Hastings Also Deny New York Reports</p>
<p>(London, 4th, National Telegraph) William O'Brien, an advocate of professional tennis in the United States, claimed that the world's top three male and female tennis stars would join his professional organization. Today, all three players denied the claim. Mrs. Hastings, a member of the British Wightman Cup team, and Mrs. Hatton Jakob, the top American player, both said that O'Brien's remarks were unfounded. Today, the Standard Evening News also received a phone call from Melbourne, Australia, stating that Pan Lai will return to England in April and will maintain his amateur status. According to O'Brien's declaration in New York yesterday, Pan Lai, the world's number one player, has agreed to sign a contract in San Francisco on February 21. Mrs. Hastings has already signed, and Miss Jakob will also sign soon. Pan Lai's compensation is US$40,000, Miss Jakob US$20,000, and Mrs. Hastings US$10,000.</p>
<p>(Melbourne, 4th, Reuters) Today, a Reuters reporter visited Pan Lai, who said that he had never heard of the compensation mentioned in New York and that he did not want to sign any contract until he had returned to London and discussed it with the British Lawn Tennis Association.</p>

Today, a Reuters reporter visited Tilden to discuss Pan Lai's decision to postpone joining the professional organization until the 1935 Davis Cup is resolved.</p>
<p>(New York, 3rd, National Telegraph) World amateur tennis has suffered another major blow today. According to professional tennis promoter O'Brien, the world's top three male and female tennis stars, Pan Lai, Miss Jakob, and Mrs. Hastings, will all join his professional organization and give up their amateur status. World-renowned stars Tilden, Vines, Richards, Stoeffen, Henton, and others are already in O'Brien's organization. Now, with the addition of these three major stars, their power will be further enhanced. According to O'Brien, Pan Lai will come to San Francisco on February 21 to sign a contract. The compensation will be US$40,000 for Pan Lai, US$20,000 for Miss Jakob, and US$10,000 for Mrs. Hastings. Plans are being made to arrange competitions starting in March of this year.

<p>Inviting Director Pan as Judge</p>
<p>The American World Children's Friendship Association sent a large number of picture postcards and other gifts to the Municipal Education Bureau last year, asking them to distribute them to children throughout the city to connect feelings. It is now known that the Municipal Education Bureau, in order to reciprocate the kindness of the American children, has collected corresponding gifts from elementary schools and children's organizations throughout the city as a response. The letter to the United States has also been entrusted to the Children's Morning Post to solicit through a reward. It is said that students from elementary schools throughout the city are actively participating. The contents of the letter must include: (1) Thanking them for their letters and gifts, (2) The situation in Shanghai, (3) The living conditions of children in Shanghai, (4) Hoping that they will report good news at any time.

The judges are Pan Gongzhan, Zeng Shengdian, Hu Shuyi, Zhou Shang, Zhang Zhu, Ye Yusheng, Qian Fugong and others.</p>
<h3>Female Educator Zhou Huiqing Passes Away</h3>
<p>Madam Zhou Huiqing, wife of Zhang Xinbo, principal of Xin Huan Vocational Middle School, was a distinguished student of the Patriotic Women's School. She was particularly well-versed in literature and had many writings, poems, and essays. Fellow villagers regarded her highly. After graduation, she successively served as a teacher at schools such as Haimen Shangping Girls' Middle School and Nantong Third Elementary School. Since marrying Mr. Zhang, the couple has been deeply devoted to each other. Mr. Zhang and his brothers founded Xin Huan Middle and Elementary Schools, and Madam Zhou assisted in the process, successively serving as the director of teaching at Xin Huan Elementary School and the director of affairs at Xin Huan Vocational Middle School, which was particularly laborious. A month ago, when a student contracted scarlet fever, she visited and cared for the student several times, resulting in her being infected and developing diphtheria. She was immediately sent to the Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. She passed away in the hospital at 5:00 AM yesterday. It is said that the funeral will be held at 2:00 PM on January 7th at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road. Our country's female community has lost a talent. It is most regrettable.</p>

<h3>Interest Is the Mother of Success</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>No matter what a person does, they must have interest. Only then can they do it happily, and only then will what they do develop. Reading is certainly the same.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of school subjects, all of which are common general knowledge of life. It is impossible not to know some of them, so one must have an interest in studying each subject.</p>
<p>However, among all the subjects, each person has their own opinion on which is the most interesting. This varies from person to person, just like eating. Some people like to eat salty foods, while others like to eat sweet foods. Tastes differ, so naturally what they like to eat is also different. This difference is due to the proximity or dissimilarity of individual personalities.</p>
<p>For example, some children like drawing and are particularly interested in it. They have the hope of becoming successful artists in the future. Some children like mathematics and are particularly interested in it. They have the hope of becoming successful mathematicians in the future. If you teach someone who likes drawing to calculate mathematics, they will definitely not calculate very accurately. And if you teach someone who likes mathematics to draw, they will definitely not draw very well. This is because their personalities are not similar, so their interest is not that strong, and their performance is relatively poor.</p>
<p>The personality of the great biologist Darwin was to like studying biology. So in elementary school, although his other subjects were relatively poor, he was not naughty. It was because he felt that his interest in other subjects was not as strong as his interest in biology.</p>
<p>Based on this example, I offer to the children that reading should be of interest. Although some subjects are not suitable for your personality, because they are common knowledge, they should not be ignored. As for subjects that are very suitable for your personality, you should practice them especially, as they are the mother of your future success.</p>
<p>The success of famous people in the world is all due to their childhood interests, coupled with continuous effort. Children, how precious is this interest?</p>
<h3>Little Youth League</h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>Ms. Ellen Key clearly told us: The 20th century is the century of the child. That's right, the century of the child. But how to promote the spirit of our children, display the characteristics of our children, and develop the talents of our children?</p>
<p>This semester, eight elementary schools in the Xugongqiao Central Elementary School District have organized a Little Youth League. The purpose of the league is to cultivate character, train the body, and study knowledge. Each league has a leader and a deputy leader. Recently, they have all taken the New Life Movement as a training goal, preparing to become disciplined people under the principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.</p>
<p>Recently, a general assembly and a New Life speech contest were held at the central school. The spirit was full, the order was well-maintained, and it was highly praised by local and foreign people.</p>
<p>This winter vacation, they plan to organize a winter defense team with the local people to provide practical services to the public.</p>
<p>Children! Don't be silent anymore! Now is the century of the child. Get up and cheer up!</p>
<h3>Good Student</h3>
<p>— Cao Meiying, Second Grade Student of Wanzhu Elementary School</p>
<p>Elementary school students, respect teachers, listen carefully to teachers' lectures, and strive to be the first in exams.</p>
<p>Elementary school students, be calm, people respect those who read calmly, and parents are happy in their hearts when they see me.</p>
<p>Elementary school students, be clean, take care of your body and clothes, pay attention to hygiene to avoid diseases.</p>
<p>Elementary school students, be diligent, review homework when you go home after school, and don't worry about big exams if you are familiar with your homework.</p>
<p>Elementary school students, be filial, it is most important to respect and love your parents, and remember your parents' teachings in your heart.</p>
<p>Elementary school students, be upright, don't tell lies to deceive people, only then can you be a good student.</p>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>When I arrived at school the day before yesterday morning, I saw many classmates taking brooms and dustpans to sweep the streets. Everyone was working with great enthusiasm. They had all become temporary street cleaners.</p>
<p>At half past eleven, we began to clean the classroom, sweeping the floor, wiping the glass, wiping the blackboard, arranging the tables, and everyone had a job. For a while, the sound of chaos continued from the classrooms. After twelve o'clock, the classrooms were very different from half an hour ago. Everything was neat and clean, like a bad person suddenly turning into a good person.</p>
<p>Cleaning is to remove dirty things, making this place clean and tidy. It is best to clean people's hearts as well, and not let dirty thoughts remain in the heart.</p>
<p>This cleaning not only made the place clean and made us feel the benefits and methods of cleaning, but also made us feel the fun of this cleaning, and we often helped our mothers sweep at home. In the future, we will develop a habit of diligence, which will be of great benefit to ourselves. If others do not help you sweep, you can do it yourself and not feel difficult. This is truly a gift from the great cleaning.</p>
<h3>Mutual Help</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Reed Pith Dancing</h3>
<p>— Yan Bokuang</p>
<p>Dear children! Have you ever performed at school? Have you ever performed dancing? Dancing is very beneficial for the even development of the muscles and bones of the whole body, and can make the body healthy and beautiful.</p>
<p>But today there is a very fun game, that is, reed pith can also dance. Use a reed pith and pick it into one-inch lengths, and randomly place them on the table. Then use a small square of white paper, smoke it over charcoal fire, put it on the table and immediately rub it with your thumb on the paper several times. While it is hot, move it over the reed pith about half an inch away. The reed pith placed on the table will seem to be dancing, all being sucked onto the paper.</p>
<p>Physics tells us that the paper, heated by the charcoal fire and rubbed by the thumb, generates electricity. The reed pith is attracted by the electric heat.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Children's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Miaoshen</p>
<p>Whether children are lively or not is partly due to external influences. But it is also different due to different environments. Under the supervision of adults who do not know what children's education is, Chinese children are urged to be (quiet), to sit as upright as adults and listen to speeches. Children have no way to be lively! In addition, the clothes that children wear are all wide robes and long gowns. Since movement is not convenient, there is no way to be lively! This is not because Chinese children are inherently dull, but because adults cultivate their dull appearance. In China, there is no term (children's clothing). Boys wear long robes and mandarin jackets, and sometimes even wear a melon-skin cap. Girls also wear cheongsams that reach the ankles, and their actions have the style of adults. It is naturally difficult to develop a strong body in the future if they have developed sluggish actions since childhood. Let's look at the children in the West. They are all smart and lively. Children have children's clothing. Boys under sixteen or seventeen years old cannot wear trousers; girls under sixteen or seventeen years old cannot wear high heels and women's clothing. Their adults treat children neither casually nor indulgently, but devote most of their energy to children, so that they develop a lively and happy mind and body. This is correct. Children are the future masters of the country!</p>
<p>I think that the clothing of our country's children should be improved as soon as possible. Children should definitely not wear long clothes, and it is also appropriate to wear less. There is a common saying in our country: (If you want your child not to go to the doctor, always keep them slightly cold and hungry.) However, most parents dote on their children and dress them like roly-poly dolls. This actually makes children develop delicate bodies and weak constitutions. Loving them actually harms them. Western children mostly wear at most two or three pieces of clothing, and even wear shorts in winter. Some people say that this is because Westerners are physically strong, so they will not freeze. Chinese people will freeze. Little do they know that if they train their bodies like this from childhood, their bodies can gradually become stronger. As for the style of children's clothing, it is okay to refer to Western styles, or to create new styles. In short, it must be hygienic and meet the needs of children's lively and free movement. Children are our successors, the future masters of the new China. Don't be too indifferent to children!</p>
<h3>Fairy Tale</h3>
<p>— Written by Ms. Qin Qianpei</p>
<p>(1) The laborer was not free for a moment under his master's whip all day long. This time, seeing that the master was fast asleep in the car, he was able to sit in front of the car and doze off a little in peace. That bad thing who had no food to eat and relied on robbery saw it and said, "Ah, a good opportunity has come! A fat and rich man." (2) He tied the sheep to the car, rode on its back, and told the sheep to run faster. (The sheep ran, and the rich man in the car was awakened from his sweet dream, and the laborer in front of the car also fell to the ground.</p>
<h3>Apple Clock</h3>
<p>— Zhaori</p>
<p>Children, here I am going to teach you a very interesting toy, that is, to make a clock out of an apple. This kind of toy made by your own efforts is much better than selling foreign toys!</p>
<p>Materials: A large apple, a small knife, three bamboo sticks, and a sheet of white paper.</p>
<p>Making: First, use a small knife to cut the apple into the shapes of (Picture 1) and (Picture 2); second, insert a bamboo stick into the second picture and insert it into the appearance of (Picture 3); third, cut the white paper into a circle, write numbers on it, and the center must also be cut into long and short hands of the clock with black paper strips, see (Picture 4). See, isn't a very smart and ingenious clock completed?</p>
<h3>Picture 1</h3>
<h3>Picture 2</h3>
<h3>Picture 3</h3>
<h3>Picture 4</h3>
<p>(Appendix) When you cut the long and short hands, you must work very carefully, otherwise you will cut them off. Also, the second picture should not be cut too large, because if it is too large, it will be very ugly. If you put this beautiful apple clock in an exquisite place, it is very impressive.</p>
<h3>Coldest and Hottest</h3>
<p>— Yang Bian</p>
<p>Children, what are the coldest things in the world, and where are they? What are the hottest things, and where are they? I think you must often want to know! Okay, now I will report to you.</p>
<p>The coldest place in the world is a small town in northern Siberia called Oymyakon. The temperature there, in the coldest time, is as low as 90.4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. This cold temperature can freeze mercury.</p>
<p>The temperature in the space between the planets is 454 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, which can be said to be the lowest temperature in nature.</p>
<p>The lowest temperature created by us humans is solid air, and its temperature is 447.8 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, which is not much different from the cold extreme of 459.4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Let's talk about heat. We know that the hottest place in the world is the Sahara Desert, where the temperature reaches a maximum of 736 degrees Fahrenheit. Of course, all living things cannot survive. The center of the Earth is 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The sun is a ball of fire, and its temperature is of course incredibly high. According to Professor Eddington's calculations, the temperature at its center is about 72,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Even its outer layer is 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>As for the highest temperature created by humans, it is 45,000 degrees, which is a hundred times stronger than sunlight. It is really hot!</p>
<h3>Animal Talk</h3>
<p>— (Yang Zhen, Fifth Grader of Xunyu Elementary School)</p>
<p>(1) The chicken is very diligent. It always shouts loudly every morning (Brother, get up).</p>
<p>(2) A dog's eyes cannot distinguish colors. When it sees something, it always says repeatedly (Yellow, yellow, yellow).</p>
<p>(3) The sheep is very filial, often shouting (Mama, Mama).</p>
<p>(4) The duck is an optimist, and you can often hear its laughing sound (Hahahaha).</p>
<p>(5) The cat is greedy. When it sees a mouse, it says happily (Miao, miao).</p>
<p>(6) The frog is a sufferer of a cold. It often (Cock-a-doodle-doo).</p>
<p>(7) The goose has the worst temper. It often scolds people (Stupid, stupid).</p>
<p>(8) The mouse has also gone to college, and is a stutterer. It always says (Know-stop, know-stop).</p>
<p>(9) The pig is big, but it is often so angry that it doesn't even want to speak. It always puckers its mouth (Huhu).</p>
<p>(10) The swallow's speech is also different. When it comes back in the spring, it always says (Good to live, live, live. Not good to live, not live).</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor is a very famous children's book in Europe. Sinbad sailed seven times, experienced all kinds of hardships, but remained indomitable, overcoming dangers as if they were nothing. This kind of hard-working, adventurous spirit should be introduced to our country's children as an example. Therefore, I have faithfully translated it and contributed it to the Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly.</p>
<p>Sinbad's First Voyage</p>
<p>When my father died, he left me a rich fortune, but after a long time, I squandered my time and money in unrestrained indulgence. Finally, I decided to change my life situation, so I sold all my fields and goods and set off with a group of people who were going overseas to trade.</p>
<p>We left Basra on a good ship and set sail for the East Indies. We went everywhere and did very good business with our goods.</p>
<p>One fine and quiet day, we approached a verdant island. According to the leader of the sailors on board, if we wanted to go ashore, we could. We were happy to stretch our legs, so a group of us took a small boat to the shore.</p>
<p>We had a great time on the island because walking on solid ground again was very pleasant. But suddenly, the ground began to shake. The people on the ship saw this and immediately gestured for us to hurry back to the ship. It turned out that what we thought was land was not, but the back of a large whale!</p>
<p>Some of our group had already gotten into the small boat and rowed back to the ship, while others jumped into the sea and swam over; but I was still on the whale's back when it suddenly turned over into the sea.</p>
<p>This put me in a strange situation. I happened to grab a large piece of wood that we had brought for starting fires. If not for this, I would have certainly sunk.</p>
<p>I looked around and saw that my friends had all boarded the ship, and just as a favorable wind rose, the ship immediately set sail; in a short while, it was gone.</p>
<p>This year is the National Children's Year. I hope that all the children of the country will understand their position, strive to be energetic, and work hard to improve themselves. Written by Wu Bixi, age ten.</p>

<h3>(This Year's Me) Special Issue</h3>
<p>— Meng Jun</p>
<p>It's New Year again.</p>
<p>In the past, I dreaded the New Year, just as I disliked my annual birthday. I always felt it took something away, and what it left me wasn't exactly dazzling hope.</p>
<p>Now, I've changed that mindset. On the contrary, before the New Year even arrives, I find myself, like a child, with anticipation for the New Year, waiting for it. Because I want to settle accounts with the past and also start some new plans.</p>
<p>My plans don't have anything extravagant, but they are a solid spur for myself. I want to use them as a yardstick to measure whether the days of this year are wasted.</p>
<p>Naturally, I'm not a member of the leisure class. I have to spend eight hours a day to earn a living. I don't use work to kill time. But the responsibility of the era rests on everyone's shoulders, and I'm only willing to appropriately shoulder the portion I can bear.</p>
<p>First, I am planning with friends to set up a nursery, in Nanjing, where there isn't one yet. The goal is to give large groups of women time to participate in social activities and become a part of advancing the times. It is necessary to find ways to reduce their burden of childcare. We also know that the few nurseries can only help a small number of women, but using facts as propaganda, the impact will not be small.</p>
<p>Second, running remedial schools: We are all a group who have neither money nor philanthropists or high-ranking officials to rely on. All we have are some spare time and enthusiasm. Remedial schools are based on these objective conditions. So our plan is to rent one or two rooms in a peasant community or near a small factory, gather thirty to fifty poor women, and we ourselves will be the teachers. Naturally, we also hope that through the teacher-student relationship, they can give us some practical lessons, and we can also help them more.</p>
<p>Third, we also have a group, which was just organized last year, and it has not yet reached a sound stage. 1935 will make it gradually sound, until it can shoulder greater and more responsibilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore: My knowledge and ability are not enough. Moreover, the times are progressing day by day. How to prevent myself from being knocked down by the times in this continuous progress, and how to enrich myself to adapt to the work I am willing to undertake, this is also one of my plans for this year.</p>
<p>First, theoretical understanding is the compass for action. Without theory as a basis, work is blind. In China, where even translation work is scarce, not being able to read foreign language books means almost no opportunity to receive new theories. Therefore, mastering a foreign language has become an urgent need for me personally.</p>
<p>Second, reading and writing: In addition to ordinary magazines, systematic reading is to enrich myself and help me act more correctly. Writing is also in my plan.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, I can only end this briefly.</p>
<p>January 2, 1935, in Nanjing.</p>
<p>— Cai Muhui</p>
<p>This morning, I went to the office. As soon as I stepped out of the elevator, someone said, "HAPPY NEW YEAR." Naturally, I had to reply with a "HAPPY NEW YEAR," even though in my heart, I really didn't have the slightest interest in celebrating the New Year. Entering the room, I saw many mails piled on the desk. After opening and reading them one by one, I felt very ashamed, because I haven't sent New Year's cards to relatives and friends for several years.</p>
<p>In the past, when the New Year was approaching, I did spend a lot of time racking my brains to print New Year cards and such things. I also often talked with my sisters about the plans for the coming year by the candlelight on New Year's Eve. But in recent years, because I have had too much life experience of "(eight or nine times things happen unexpectedly, only two or three times things conform to the plan)," I have lost the interest in printing New Year cards and discussing plans. A few days ago, Ms. Zi Jiu asked me to write a section on "(This Year's Me)," but I refused for this reason. Last night, she specified in the phone that I should write about going abroad, and because I couldn't find any more reasons to refuse, tonight I have to lock myself in a cold room and write a few words that I didn't originally intend to write.</p>
<p>Anyway, Ms. Zi Jiu didn't say that I had to make a report at the end of the year. Even if my plan cannot be realized, I don't have to apologize to the readers, so I will boldly write on. Otherwise...</p>
<p>My colleagues, because I have been doing mechanical work for seven or eight years, really want to give me a chance to go out and get some fresh air. In the past few months, they have been racking their brains to plan travel expenses and contact schools for me. I will probably be able to go around the end of summer or early autumn. Although I haven't expressed anything to them, I am very grateful for their kindness in my heart. They have scheduled a little more than a year for my trip, and the travel route is first to the United States and then to Europe. In New York City, I can probably spend a few months as a student, but I don't have the ambition to get a degree. I just want to choose one or two more interesting courses according to my own interests. During this trip, as long as I can travel to more places, observe the actual lives of people in various countries more, and have more opportunities to come into contact with various ideas, my own wishes will be satisfied. My colleagues and friends naturally have many more extravagant hopes. They often tell me this and that, but in this short period of time, I'm afraid there are quite a few things that cannot be done, so I'd better not say them now.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend said to me, "(Would you like us to prepare a large batch of stupid questions for you? That's what you will often need to answer after you go to the United States. We Americans are best at asking stupid questions, and people without experience can easily be embarrassed by them.)" I think her words are right. Although I have never been abroad, I have been embarrassed by Americans many times. Therefore, in the seven or eight months before going abroad, I may have to spend more of my spare time preparing stupid answers to stupid questions.</p>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>Disease and poverty can destroy a person's entire life: everything of mine has been ruined by illness. But this year, I always want to turn over from the sea of ​​suffering from illness and appear in a healthy posture.</p>
<p>If I could be on camera: I would like to play a particularly individual and most tragic role among the bankrupt peasants in the countryside and the unemployed poor in the city. Because I have the passion to act in tragedies, I have the (theatrical personality) to laugh and cry suddenly, and can shout out the most profound sorrow for them.</p>
<p>If I could be a director: I would like to draw a strictly armed boundary line on the same world stage, and on one side perform the vampires of the colony, their ferocious faces, sinister means, violent and terrifying authority, and extravagant lives;) on the other side, perform the forced extraction, slaughter, and people struggling in hunger, death, and cries, their scene in the dark hell. Then, from the body of each toiling and oppressed person, draw a glistening thread of blood and sweat directly to the vampires, turning it into piles of gold coins for them to enjoy, to be used to supply the Second World War and create more colonies and more slaves.</p>
<p>Making the stage such a strong contrast, a realistic photograph, let the audience know who should seize the guns that draw the boundary and use them to fight their own enemy, the imperialists!</p>
<p>But can I realize this kind of desire? To talk about this year's me, I have to settle accounts with the past me: I have been dragged down by six years of terrible illness, making me like a living corpse that has not been buried. My miserable life is unbelievable. The spring before last, I locked myself in my room and fell into bed for five days, and no one knew about it. The first person to discover that I was seriously ill was the young eldest daughter of Mr. Wang Zaoshi's family. She opened my door, woke me up, borrowed money to take me to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, and then gambled and won money to buy me medicine. Last autumn, my fierce illness came in succession and could not be cured. Just when I was in danger of letting it kill me, I unexpectedly received some money from a kind stranger to save my life.</p>
<p>My life was saved, but the disease has penetrated deep into my bones and I still cannot move. I am heavily in debt and my life is miserable. I have not been able to buy a book or magazine for three or four years. In this way, what else can I do while alive? When the creditors force me to escape, I am afraid that the newspapers this year will have the news of "(Bai Wei jumping into the sea to commit suicide)." At that time, I, who am often rumored by tabloids, don't know what tricks the tabloids will use to spread rumors about me?</p>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>I believe that people cannot do whatever they want, on the contrary, the environment makes you do what it wants. This may be mechanical objectivism, but I think it is closer to the truth. According to my experience, a person's ability to act always cannot withstand the compulsion of the environment!</p>
<p>(This year's me), I think it will be the same as in previous years. Even if I have some plans, I will always hit a wall with the environment when implementing them! So I don't want to talk about any annual plans. However, at the beginning of this year, I have to go back to my hometown. This is indeed a big change in my personal life. On this eve of parting, let's talk about my feelings about living in Shanghai for the past few years.</p>
<p>The only means of production I rely on to make a living in Shanghai is the G-pen nib, Globe brand ink, and Kaiming manuscript paper. I, who have no literary reputation in the cultural world, can only be a (book translator) who changes the appearance of Japanese goods into domestic goods under the (cultural and commercial public)'s package. Although the wages are very limited, my family of several people will not starve to death. But recently, the publishing industry is in a panic, especially the native culture is in the limelight. The smart (cultural and commercial public) seized the opportunity to change careers, and as a result, I became an unemployed person who cannot even be exploited. In fact, it is common to starve to death and freeze to death in Shanghai due to unemployment. Just thinking about this makes me shudder!</p>
<p>However, I am not disappointed because of this. I believe that this situation will not last long. The world will one day be free from unemployment panic. This year's me is only looking forward to this day coming sooner!</p>
<p>— Guo Zhenyi</p>
<p>Like such a small me, floating and sinking in the sea of ​​life, year after year, not worthy of saying anything about this year. However, the whip of experience always whips people to recall the past and look forward to the future.</p>
<p>Reading for a diploma and writing for fame seem to be a common phenomenon. Experience tells me that in order to enrich my life, in addition to being tempered by life, I need to read more valuable books myself. This year, I hope to write some articles that are harmless to people and buy some books that are beneficial to myself.</p>
<p>Saving the country, running social undertakings, and behaviors that win social praise, and actions that are praised by people, seem to be the aspirations of those who consider themselves extraordinary. Experience tells me that in this deformed society, these are all tools used by "(smart people)" to deceive ordinary people. This year, I hope to recognize the direction of the history of human evolution and do things in a way that does not violate the trend of this great era.</p>
<p>Entering the political stage to increase one's prestige and participating in the women's movement to show off one's talent seem to be the outlets that some people recognized in the past. Experience tells me that these are mostly the selfish thoughts of individualists and have nothing to do with the masses of women and the suffering masses. This year, I hope to broaden my horizons, see through the core of things, and develop a courageous and progressive outlook on life. With correct consciousness, do some small work that people are unwilling to do and disdain to do.</p>
<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>The New Year is here. According to the general Chinese custom, the New Year should be laughed at. Crying can bring about a year of success. But how do I cry? If I am an old woman, when I laugh, a tooth falls out of my mouth, I can be comforted: this chaotic and poor time has reduced my age by one year. If I am a young daughter, when I laugh on New Year's morning and娇滴滴(jiāodīdi-) call out "(Mom)," a piece of candy or a glutinous rice ball will immediately fall into my mouth. If I now have a wealthy gentleman husband, then on the eve of the New Year, I dress up, put on high heels, twist my waist a couple of times, walk 咯哒咯哒(gē dá gē dá) to my husband who is leaning on the sofa smoking a pipe, and (拍) (pāi)print a red lip print on his cheek, then purse my lips and glance at him, 扑哧(pūchī) send the sound and appearance together into his pipe. He puts his arms around my waist, and I take the opportunity to act coquettishly:</p>
<p>"(Honey, I will always belong to you, and I will never associate with any boyfriends in the future. But you are not allowed to take money to spend on other women. Tonight, hee hee, I will好好地(hǎohāodì)......)."</p>
<p>In this way, at least my New Year's mahjong expenses will not be a problem.</p>
<p>But I am nothing, I have nothing. All I have is my own labor and a few iron nails brought back from the labor market. Then, don't laugh and cry? How dare I! In the current society that tramples on women, in a social system that only supports women selling their bodies and does not allow women to sell their labor, we are in need of hard struggle. Now, we can neither laugh nor cry. We must work hard to find companions and transform the "(human flesh market)" for women into a labor market.</p>
<p>This non-laughing and non-crying is my New Year!</p>
<p>— Yao Huilian</p>
<p>I am a freshman in college and got married on New Year's Day last year, so I could not continue my studies. My husband is a member of the bourgeoisie, and the condition for him to marry me is my "(beauty)."</p>
<p>My position in the family can be regarded as "(young mistress)." I live in a three-story foreign house, wear silk and satin, and ride in a car. In short, the material enjoyment is extremely luxurious. If I had no knowledge, then I might as well bury my life in this turbid air.</p>
<p>But I have now decided to divorce him. After the divorce, I plan to work as a female worker in a factory, wanting to develop the ability to be self-reliant, and on the one hand, to fulfill my long-held wishes.</p>
<p>Because a person who is simply a "(biological person)" can be said to be an incomplete person. Only by being a "(social person)" can one have the meaning of a person and be considered a complete person.</p>
<p>The life of a "(young mistress)" is, at best, a typical woman of a virtuous mother and good wife. To put it plainly, it is a victim of traditional concepts and social systems. Because in this way, the husband's will is my will, and I cannot have my own free will. In this way, I am equivalent to an accessory of the husband. In other words, I am just his sexual tool. But I have innate freedom and will and should transform my current environment.</p>
<p>Going to work in a factory as a worker, although workers in the eyes of ordinary capitalists are simply treated like cattle and horses, workers are still more decent than they are, who sit in cars, live in foreign houses, and marry concubines with the profits generated by the workers' sweat and blood. Therefore, I want to go to work, to preach, to teach... to make people realize what workers are. I think this kind of obligation should also be fulfilled.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this year's me is not an ornament of the bourgeoisie, but a completely independent and free person, and I also want to help others succeed in becoming completely independent and free people.</p>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>First of all, please allow me to use a few words to explain the past me. In this regard, borrowing a famous saying often used by a certain gentleman is enough, namely: "(Unemployment, unemployment, the third one is still unemployment.)"</p>
<p>For many years, I, who have been crushed by unemployment and have become a "(career insulated body)," will not have much promise this year! Fortunately, at the end of last year, a friend told me that a famous foreign university in this city has a special vocational guidance department, which specializes in vocational guidance. Many Chinese and foreign scholars are engaged in guidance, and many young Chinese men and women have also chosen this department as a lifelong career and started to immerse themselves in research there with four years of university time.</p>
<p>For me, this is more practical than the news of the Buddha's rebirth. Therefore, this year's me, the first step is to be like a Muslim going on a pilgrimage to Mecca, regardless of wading through mountains and rivers, I also want to meet these vocational guidance experts who are saviors of the unemployed. Even if I can't get in and see the great experts, I will also visit one or two of their disciples and grandchildren. If, fortunately, the first step (unemployment) is resolved, everything will be no problem for this year's me. If I am lucky enough to get a small prize, then I will find a way to publish the secret in the newspapers or magazines to the unemployed comrades.</p>
<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>I especially feel that this year's active New Year has a strong enlightening power, a time-dividing critique, how the present and the future give me a kind of necessary self-consciousness.</p>
<p>In any case, detachment from practice is a critical illness of life! Especially for me, a woman who is oppressed! Surrounding me are: the threat of poverty and illness; the humble temptation of quiet enjoyment; the tenderness of love like a net; the unprincipled empty talk life of intellectuals. If I am negligent or slack, it is obvious and easy that if I am not destroyed by poverty and illness, I will be crushed under the wheels of the times.</p>
<p>Hidden in the subtle weaknesses and ignorance in life, if not criticized and overcome, will inevitably develop into the cause of falling at some point in time. That's right, if the threat of reality unconsciously泛滥(fànlàn) in my heart, temptation and indulgence will take advantage of the situation; what is the conclusion of my life? How terrible this is!</p>
<p>From the past to yesterday, from yesterday to today, the history of the fall and rise of many figures cannot be regarded as accidental, but is precisely a mirror of our lives. The truth is: if you don't advance, you retreat, and there is nothing that stays still. Wisdom and emotion should be expanded by a faithful and healthy life and solid knowledge.</p>
<p>Thoroughly understanding one's own and society as a member of women; the skilled practice of historical dialectics, the intimacy and familiarity of art and science, must be the trajectory of my life this year.</p>
<p>(Serious life, establish life on a solid foundation of knowledge!) I thus celebrate the beginning of my 1935.</p>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>The cold wind gusts, blowing away all the stale things of twenty-three years.</p>
<p>The New Year dances with the symbol of hard work, singing the song of progress, and walks out of the crowded crowd.</p>
<p>The New Year, this singable and laudable, joyful and encouraging New Year, she is pregnant with the melting light of spring and the power of life! This power is the driving force behind everything on earth. Ah, New Year, she will push this earth to walk towards the bright road! Run over the muddy fields and walk on the flat avenue!</p>
<p>The New Year will also push the women of the earth and push them to the broad society. Let them expand the things of the family into the things of the society; simplify and specialize. Organize public childcare, public canteens, sewing, weaving, dyeing companies... etc. Everyone does what they can and engages in the work they want to do; dedicate the whole self to mankind and serve the entire mankind.</p>
<p>Women, take your supreme love and love the public, don't just love your husband and son! Sacrifice your supreme ability for the public; don't sacrifice your precious mind and body only for your lover!</p>
<p>Because I am a woman, I hope that when women are pushing the wheel of the times in the New Year, they will all move forward with a clamor!</p>
<p>The hope for women is also the hope for myself. From now on: I want to take off this silk robe that binds my actions, throw away these pointed high heels that hinder my steps, cut off this foot-long, tortuous and not straightforward troublesome hair, and wash away the grease and powder that contaminates my pure skin. Nakedly be a new woman and a new me in 1935!</p>
<p>— Pu Shunqing</p>
<p>I am studying law, currently practicing law, and also a lover of literature. On this New Year's Day morning of the 24th year, I planned what I should do this year: Now I summarize and write it below:</p>
<p>(1) At least ten famous works of law and literature should be read carefully this year to enrich the tools of work.</p>
<p>(2) Compile two law books and two dramas this year. (Because although I am a person who studies law, I also love drama.)</p>
<p>(3) In my lawyer's duties, I will do my best to help oppressed women and recover their legal rights.</p>
<p>(4) Last year, my friend Lawyer Chen Yunxian and I planned to set up a women's voluntary legal advisory department in the firm to solve legal problems for women with financial difficulties. I hope this can be realized this year.</p>
<p>(5) This year, I am willing to help a thousand women gain the legal knowledge they deserve.</p>
<p>I hope to implement the above simple work plan without any discount, so as not to fail this year's me. Now I have written it out to warn myself and earnestly ask my loving friends to encourage me!</p>
<p>New Year's Day of the 24th year in Shanghai</p>
<p>— Yang Yu</p>
<p>All human activities cannot be separated from starting from the individual or society. Only when individuals live a stable life can we talk about social efforts; therefore, for this year's me, the prerequisite is still to calculate the livelihood of this year, and at the same time, my personal attitude towards life and the direction of being a person must also be determined. Recalling the five years since I left school life, I stepped into this colorful society. I have been a school teacher and an editor, but five years of experience and the lessons society has taught me are that I don't understand society and can't adapt to society. Using the theory of being a person obtained from books for more than ten years to deal with society is really not in line with the way of survival in the current society. People are singing loudly about saving the country with personality and being fair and selfless, and the posture is hard and upright, but I know that this is just a means of the superiors to the subordinates and the big figures to the small figures. And I have not thoroughly understood this truth, and stubbornly, directly, and foolishly, as a result, I am farther and farther away from society. When it comes to what movement, people's brand is hung high and for a long time, holding meetings, giving speeches, writing articles, and talking about liberation, making a shocking noise, but I, without understanding that this is an occasion to create a position for myself, did not know how to be opportunistic or suspect in advance, so people thought I was stupid and foolish. This year's me, what attitude should I take in the direction of walking? This question was carefully considered on the eve of the New Year, and finally it was decided that this year's trend of being a person is still to take the stupid road. The first is to strengthen the individual's personality and maintain an independent spirit. To be able to break into and out of society, regardless of losses, hardships, and being fooled, strive to struggle. The second is that beyond the small self, do not forget the big self. If I am myself, can't I express my personality and implement my views in the big self, then wouldn't my struggle be meaningless? My comrades urge me and her to continue our cause and expand our organization, the Female Voice Society. This is really the key point in my plan this year. As long as society gives a glimmer of light, so that this stupid person has the opportunity to work hard, this year's me will not be in vain in these three hundred and sixty-five days.</p>
<p>— Zhu Yongli</p>
<p>I am a sixteen-year-old girl. The year I came to Shanghai from Hunan, I happened to encounter Japan starting a war against us, so my father became unemployed. Later, when my family's life became impossible, I was introduced to a cotton mill to work. After working for more than three months, I only received two yuan in wages, so I stopped doing it. Then I was introduced to a factory to work. Although the wages in this factory were very small, the work was very light and the time was not much, so my father taught me to read in the evening and I worked during the day. This way, I supplemented the family's life and continued until now.</p>
<p>I know that we young people need to maintain our lives and acquire knowledge at the same time, so from this year on, I will continue my past plan, working and studying at the same time. Naturally, there is no better way other than this. But I know that reading is not just about recognizing a few characters, but about understanding our own problems; because I am a young person, and those modern ladies are also young people. Why do they have the opportunity to go to school: I don't know how many young women like me are in China now. Why don't they all have the opportunity to go to school, and only a few modern ladies can go to school?</p>
<h3>Editor's Notes</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Welcoming the New Year, although it is still the same old people, everyone will have plans and aspirations at the beginning of the year. The motivation for publishing this special issue is to glimpse the personal expectations of the readers and sowers of (Women's Garden).</p>
<p>Individuals are inherently members of society, and the dynamics of individuals are a manifestation of a corner of social affairs. Although limited by space, we cannot publish everything, but from this, we can observe the hopes of a segment of knowledgeable women.</p>
<p>Some here will soar thousands of miles and visit the world, some vow to bury themselves in hard work and seek the liberation of women, and even more are the cries of grief and indignation under the heavy pressure of poverty and illness!</p>
<p>In this long and deep night with biting cold, savoring these active strategies of resistance and passive cries of sorrow, gave me great stimulation and encouragement. I asked myself (this year's me). Ah! Me? I will abandon other complicated work and devote all my strength to opening up the garden, building the garden, uniting the sowers, and promoting the wheel of liberation!!!</p>

<h3>Financial Chips Loosen, Standard Gold Price Easier to Fall Than Rise</h3>
<p>Although Buyers See Low Prices and Become Active</p>
<p>The Result Is Still a Small Loss of 3.6 Yuan</p>
<p>After a certain Luo, a former speculator in the gold market, dumped gold, the financial chips suddenly became loose. Buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and a selling spree began, with the decline being very sharp. The Central Bank's customs gold suddenly fell, causing a great commotion among the floating longs. Major players continued to dump, and the market was extremely sluggish. Later, buyers became active as they saw low prices, and shorts also covered their positions. The market stabilized slightly after being weak, and the overall trend for half a day was very mediocre and lacking in change. However, the trend is difficult to be optimistic, and it is easier to fall than to rise. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw London rise and the United States remain flat. Forward silver prices rose and fell differently, exchange rates slightly contracted, and London raw gold rose another six and a half pence. Off-market forward transactions rose to 61.2 yuan. Major players sold on the market, lacking counterparts, because overnight floating longs took the opportunity to close out their positions and immediately retreated to 56.7 yuan, and then rose slightly. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank's official quotation was announced, with the pound rising 1.25, the US dollar rising 0.25, and the customs gold unit contracting by 7 li. The standard gold price fell to 992.8 yuan, which was a major blow to general floating longs. The morning opening was low, and after the opening, major players sold on the market. The floating longs felt pressured, and the major buyers still adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the supply in the market exceeded demand, and the decline started immediately, retreating to a low price of 51.2 yuan. Buyers took the opportunity to buy at low prices, but because people were still tired, although the price rose, it mostly fluctuated. Banks took the opportunity to cheaply buy up to settle accounts, and buyers took advantage of the situation to become active and the price rose back. Chinese banks resold shillings first. Banks also sold forward US dollars. The HSBC official quotation was announced, with the pound rising 1.25 and the US dollar rising 0.1875. Gradually retreated. The silver balance tax announced in the middle of the day remained unchanged, still levied at 6.25%. The pound exchange rate was calculated at one shilling and five pence seventy-five. Although there was a slight struggle, it lacked special stimulation, but because buyers saw low prices, they repeatedly became active. Later, trading gradually became sparse and returned to normal from time to time. However, because Fuxingyong continued to sell off a lot, the final situation was a stalemate, rising and falling suddenly, lacking special changes. Here is a record of the market conditions for half a day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 956.3 yuan, a decrease of 2.6 yuan compared to the previous close. Fuxingyong vigorously sold gold bars, and the decline started suddenly. Buyers in the market disappeared. Sassoon resold January shillings at 875. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, and Dacheng all sold, and the price fell to 1.2 yuan. Yuqingyong, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Fuxingyong, Yuanchangyong, and others bought in at low prices, and the price rose to 5.5 yuan. Zhengjin sold January US dollars at half a yuan. Dafa Yongyuan, Yifuxingyong, and Yongfeng sold off, and the price fell to 3.6 yuan. Holland bought January shillings at 875. Hengyu, Qingyu, Dafa Yong, Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, and others came in. Shanghai also bought, and the price rose to 7 yuan. Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Richang, and Dafa Yong took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the price retreated to 4.8 yuan. Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, and others entered at over 6 yuan. Hengchangyong, Yongli, Hengyu, Dingkang, and Yuanmaoyong sold off one after another. It was learned in advance that the HSBC official quotation was announced, with the pound rising 1.25 and the US dollar rising 0.25, and the price fell to 4.5 yuan. Although Fuxingyong and Yicheng entered at 5.5 yuan, the bank vigorously resold February US dollars at 125. Yuanmaoyong also repeatedly sold gold bars. Dadecheng and Qingyu Tongfu also sold to 3 yuan. Tongtaichang, Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofengchang, Hengtai, and others took the opportunity to enter at over 4 yuan. The silver balance tax announced remained unchanged. At this time, it was quite stable. Later, because Hengyu Yukang sold gold bars, the price fell to 3 yuan. Fuxingyong suddenly came to buy vigorously, and people's hearts were shaken. Hengchangyong, Zhentaichang, Datongfu, and others covered their positions one after another, and the price rose back to 8 yuan. Dehua came out with April US dollars at 625. Zhaofengchang, Dafa Yong, Shunmao, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Qingyu, Yuankangxiang, and others sold off, gradually retreating to 3.4 yuan. Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang entered slightly, and the price rose back to 5.8 yuan. Hengyu, Hengxing, Fuyu, and Yong sold off, and the price fell to 3.5 yuan. Huabi and others came out with March shillings at half a penny. People's hearts were still stable. Yicheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, and others successively bought, and the price rose to 6 yuan. Fuxingyong still sold to 4.9 yuan, while Hengyu entered. The noon closing was 955.3 yuan. Fuxingyong continued to sell after the market closed, and the price retreated into 5 yuan. The situation was more sluggish. It was found that the highest price for half a day was 958 yuan, and the lowest price was 951.2 yuan, a fluctuation of 6.8 yuan. As a result, it fell another 3.6 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard price, was 992.8 yuan, about 37 yuan lower than the closing price, with a very slight difference compared to the previous close. This month's registered price was 941 yuan, and February's was 955 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 941 yuan, and the red gold price was reduced by about 7 yuan. The official quotation was 949.3 yuan, and the spot market situation was still deserted, lacking transactions. The buying price of Tianjin goods was reduced by 5 yuan according to the term bid, and the selling price was at par. Public bonds were postponed for one day due to the weekly holiday. At present, there are very few January contracts left, and the total number is only 105, mostly held by Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Qingyu, Wanxing, Chengyu, Yuanmaoyong, and nine others. The short side only has Yuan Yi and Yingfeng Heng two companies.</p>
<p>Market transactions were chaotic, with different entries and exits. In summary, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Fuyu, Yifengyong, Qingfa Yong, Zhaofengchang, Da Xiang, Tianfeng, Yuanchangyong, Yicheng, and others were on the buying side. Although Yuanmaoyong reduced short positions by more than 1,000 contracts, most of them were transfers from Yishengyongheng and others. Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Dafeng Yongli, Kaikang Shunmao, Wanxing, Qingyu, and others were on the selling side. Dafa Yongdingkang and Tongfu first exited and then entered. Dalian help Wan and Gong did more than 400 contracts, selling less than 100 after squeezing. Shunli Gong did more than 100 contracts, slightly exiting after squeezing. Guang help Hengxingsheng was still calm. The total number of transactions on the day was 38,815 contracts.</p>

<h3>Foreign拆 Still Opens at Half a Dime</h3>
<p>Fear of Further Tightening Possible</p>
<p>Since the silver and money industry opened on the third and fourth days of the month, and settled and released funds, the tight situation of funds has not eased. The foreign 拆 market price is still five and a half cents, like a stereotype article. There was also no slight rise or fall in the morning and noon markets yesterday. The head of the account was added with water and the green head衬 初 was tight and then loose, but because it was forced by the approaching end of the summary period, it was unable to spread smoothly, so it could not suddenly fall back. As a result, it initially opened at four cents, and then opened at three cents and five points. Although the closing price was slightly milder than the previous day, it was not very sustainable. There may still be the possibility of further tightening during the day. 拆票 transactions, early market transfer of more than 3.3 million, new transactions of more than 900,000, noon market transactions of more than 400,000, small general meeting of more than 800,000, foreign mortgage transactions of more than 1.8 million, new short-term loans of more than 1.2 million to foreign merchants, long-term three or four pair of loans of 400,000 to 500,000, Chinese merchants short-term more than 800,000, long-term more than 2.3 million, banknotes recovered more than 1.2 million, issued circulation notes more than 1.3 million, secret mark notes more than 900,000, customer source 200,000, loss of 450,000, bank settlement, foreign banks settlement notes more than 2.2 million to 3 million, various goods exchange mortgage miscellaneous settlement more than 4.2 million to 3 million, foreign settlement more than 700,000, special exchange more than 800,000, supplementary miscellaneous 1.2 million, entry into warehouse 600,000, Chinese banks settlement notes more than 4.8 million to 9 million, various goods settlement miscellaneous more than 6.1 million, foreign settlement more than 2.1 million, special exchange more than 100,000, supplementary items more than 3 million, out of warehouse 900,000, Japanese banks settlement notes more than 2.5 million to 6 million, various goods exchange miscellaneous 5.4 million to 5 million, foreign settlement more than 1.5 million, short-term mortgage more than 1.6 million, entry into warehouse 500,000, money house foreign public single settlement more than 49 million, foreign settlement head miscellaneous settlement more than 11 million, various road remittance more than 900,000, payment of cash 300,000 to 400,000, and the total number of exchanges in the Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House on the 5th, silver dollars 10,054,296.8 yuan, including silver dollars 4,435,435.6 yuan, exchange silver dollars 6,100,07526.2 yuan, and the joint reserve committee of the Shanghai Banking Association public single settlement interest, 2.8 cents per thousand yuan per day, public single discount rate, 3.5 cents per thousand yuan per day,</p>

<h3>Securities Selling Enthusiasm Waxes, Bond Market Weak and Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>The Market Price Throughout the Day Was Almost a Straight Line Down</p>
<p>The Closing Price Was Relatively Firm Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was still weak and unable to rise, and the selling enthusiasm became more and more prosperous. Some financial institutions also sold out, and people's hearts were extremely weak. As for the absorption capacity, it became weaker and weaker, and retail investors took the opportunity to dump, so the market situation became more and more struggling. The market price throughout the day was almost a straight line down. Although it slightly tended to return after entering, the overall trend did not see a turning point. The future trend, it is temporarily difficult to cheer up for a while, but the market has been under pressure for a long time, and a slightly lower foreign demolition rate is also very easy to cause a reaction. Yesterday, after the morning opening, the dumping of No. 45 and so on, people's hearts suddenly became empty, and the entry households were thin. The market situation was that the supply exceeded demand. In the second round, the selling enthusiasm became more and more prosperous, and the decline was even more fierce, with a consistent decline of 230 to half a yuan. The opening of the afternoon market was still extremely sluggish, and the market price continued to fall. There was short covering at the close, which was relatively firm. As a result, the market price throughout the day fell consistently by 230 to 670. The total number of transactions was 15,766,000 yuan.

<h3>Unfavorable Rumors Spread, Cotton Market Decline Becomes More Evident</h3>
<p>The cotton market weakened due to a reactionary fall of four rupees after the rise in Indian cotton, which further weakened confidence.  Rumors circulated in the market that the Zhengzhou cotton market was loosening, and simultaneously, gold prices softened, exchange rates lengthened, and buyers decreased.  However, large holders still refused to release their large quantities.  In the afternoon, rumors spread that several factories might shut down, which would inevitably reduce their future demand for raw materials.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao cotton fell by one or two jiao before the market opened due to the reactionary fall of three or four rupees in Indian cotton.  Gold prices continued to fall, exchange rates lengthened, and there was ample Northwest cotton in storage, most of which had not yet been exported.  Due to tightening credit conditions, market prices loosened, resulting in fewer buyers.  Prices for all months fell by five fen to one jiao and a half.  In the afternoon, short positions were covered, resulting in a slight recovery, but after two or three auctions, rumors spread widely in the market that several factories would implement shutdowns, further weakening market sentiment.  Prices for all months fell by another five fen, except for distant months, which rose slightly by five fen.  Sales included 800 dan of Yuda, 800 dan of Dafeng, 1,000 dan of Renfeng, 1,100 dan of Changfeng, 800 dan of Yikang, 1,900 dan of Changhe, and 900 dan of Xincheng.  Purchases included 2,300 dan of Yuanda, 2,300 dan of Gengfeng, 1,500 dan of Hengde, and 1,200 dan of Changfeng.

<h3>US Agricultural Policy Unchanged, Cotton Market Quietly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton market opened quietly. Before the President's speech to Congress, the market was stable, with minimal price fluctuations. Disappointing news from Liverpool prompted local and Indian traders to take profits. However, other traders and foreign firms continued to buy. After President Roosevelt announced that the government's agricultural policy would remain unchanged, the market remained quiet. At the close, there was some buying in distant months, with prices rising three points. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose two to four points. English cotton was sold by Indian traders, while local traders bought due to firmness in Alexandria and falling silver prices. Spot prices rose two points, and futures prices rose two or three points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to sales by European exporters, then strengthened due to short covering, and finally softened again due to sales by futures traders. Pingguoer fell 3.25 rupees, Aomula fell 3.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell 4 rupees. (Reported on the 4th)</p>
<p>American Cotton vs. Previous Day (Combined National Currency) British Cotton vs. Previous Day (Combined National Currency) 112.58, up 440.50. Current, 7.23, up 248.00. 112.69, unchanged, 40.80, 16.94, 346.20. 112.76, unchanged, 41.00, 26.93, 346.10. 112.81, up 2, 41.20, 36.92, 346.00. 112.66, 340.70, 46.90, 345.90. 112.71, 340.80, 56.89, 345.80.

According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 5th is 240 rupees, down 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Another New York dispatch on the 4th reported on the cotton market for the week: Trading on the New York Cotton Exchange was limited last week due to the New Year holiday and general anticipation of developments in Washington. The general business climate is good, which should stabilize prices, and there is some buying from traders. At the same time, foreign cotton prices have also risen, with foreign countries such as Liverpool, Japan, and Bombay all increasing their purchases. However, price increases are hindered by long covering and government sales, but supply remains thin. The price difference between New York and Liverpool has widened since the publication of the reduced estimate of East Indian cotton production. Moreover, the tight supply of comparable grades abroad further fuels excitement about increased export demand. Domestic hoarders remain firm, but it is widely believed that a small portion of the goods, currently pledged for 12 cents, or private production, will be sold when the March price reaches 13 cents or above.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Fall Sharply, Minor Rebound</h3>
<p>The flour market was weak then stable yesterday morning after opening.  Quotations for foreign wheat from Chicago, Canada, and other places were about four to eight fen higher.  At the opening, due to the large drop the previous day, people inside and outside the industry could not help but wait and see.  The opening price for the current month was as low as four jiao, seven fen, and seven li and a half.  However, as it approached the distant period, because the millers' hedging had stopped and there were no heard offers of spot wheat, people were steady, and bidding gradually became steady.  In addition, the market filled in the gaps.  The market atmosphere became more stable.  When the afternoon market opened, the atmosphere was tight for the current month due to swap transactions.  Large outside accounts continued to take in distant periods, so although factories put up orders, sentiment remained good.  It was found that foreign wheat chips were only one-tenth or two-tenths of what they were in previous years.  If there is no continued determination later, the trend will still seem stable.  As a result, the current month was up two and a half li, February was up one and a half fen, March was up one fen and two and a half li, April was up one and a half fen, May was up one fen and seven and a half li, and June was up two fen and seven and a half li.</p>
<p>The wheat market was generally stable. The quotation for foreign wheat was only about four or eight fen higher.  After the opening price, the current month was very stable due to the scarcity of spot goods.  The distant period was stable due to poor delivery of households.  Each transaction was still active, and the price was still hovering.  When the afternoon market opened, transactions in each month became light again.  In the current month, merchants slightly increased their purchases due to insufficient spot wheat, and the price was one or two fen higher.  There were very few openings for distant periods, and there were few ups and downs.  As a result, the current month was two fen, February was one fen, and March was three fen.  Nothing else was heard.  Spot wheat was not opened all day because the factory's appetite had not moved.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: Buyers are waiting to see when prices rise. The Far East's need for Australian wheat is extremely active. Argentina exports small batches of wheat. Chicago Wheat January 3rd, January 4th, ups and downs, May 99.50, 99.75, up 0.25, July 93.125, 93.25, up 0.125, September 91.625, 91.75, up 0.125, spot 107.25, 108.50, up 1.25. Canadian Wheat January 3rd, January 4th, ups and downs, May 83.375, 83.625, up 0.25, July 83.875, 84.00, up 0.125, spot 79.125, 79.25, up 0.125</p>
<h3>Everyone Wants to Eat New Year's Cake, Late Rice Sales Remain Strong</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of supply from various groups were slightly more than before, with a total of more than forty numbers arriving (nearly 8,000 shi of goods in total). The sales market was still brisk, and the market price rose step by step. Late rice already has a way to make cakes, and the market price has increased by one jiao to one and a half jiao. However, the various thick japonica varieties have slightly affected the price because of the large amount of incoming sources. Therefore, the price has only increased by a few fen to one jiao or so. However, considering that the weather is not sunny, there may still be a glimmer of hope afterwards, otherwise, I am afraid it will only be average. Du Yangjian, Yin Bian Yuan, and other colors are still only in a balanced state.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of goods arriving from various roads in Hexia was twenty-two or three. In terms of market sales, white japonica was active and packaged well. Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan Jian were still good. Early thin rice continued to be sold. Market price: high-quality white japonica increased by one jiao or so, medium and second-quality increased by one jiao or so, and stable thin also increased by one jiao or so. Yangjian, Bian Yin Yuan prices were stable, and the remaining goods were slightly tight.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Indica Rice Sales Active Again</h3>
<p>Another Boatload of Rice Arrives</p>
<p>Yesterday, the indica rice market was affected by the upstream winter drought, which made transportation inconvenient and increased costs while reducing supplies. However, the appetite on this street increased greatly, and the mainland also continued to purchase. Yesterday's trading was even more active. 6,600 bags of Hunan rice, 1,537 bags of Shashi rice, and 100 bags of Wuyuan rice were sold. In addition to more than 1,000 bags going to the mainland, all were handled by this street. As demand exceeds supply, prices rose step by step by five fen to one jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been arriving continuously in recent days. Yesterday, another boatload of rice, approximately 20,000 bags, arrived on the Taikoo Jiaxing wheel. The market inventory is gradually thickening, and orders continue to arrive. Subsequent batches will also arrive continuously. The market should be flat and soft. However, although this guest's appetite is fragrant these days, this street is still greedy, so the current rice can still stand firm. Yesterday, 8,000 bags of Saigon broken machine rice were sold. However, the number of orders is already large. Foreign merchants are constantly seeking to sell these days. Yesterday, Yuanli threw out 500 tons of Saigon rice for delivery in late January and early February. The price was similar to the previous market. Also, Yuan Hongmin opened 100 tons at a price of 4 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shanghai Factories Experience Miraculous Hoarding</h3>
<p>New York Year-End Silk Inventory at 66,000 Bales</p>
<p>Although there are telegrams from Shanghai overseas, Shanghai users need them, and hoarders hoard goods, so the price difference from the Shanghai market is about 30 yuan, resulting in little transaction. Yesterday's market price can be seen in the commercial news section.</p>
<p>New York raw silk year-end inventory is as follows: December Imports, December Silk, Year-End Consumption by Warehouses and Factories, Inventory. Japanese silk: 28,908 bales, 39,558 bales, 62,050 bales. European silk: 1,852 bales, 541 bales, 1,098 bales. Russian silk: 196 bales, 7 bales, 83 bales. Guangdong silk: 140 bales, 36 bales, 55 bales, 63 bales. Shanghai silk: 1,140 bales, 568 bales, 1,440 bales. Total: 30,373 bales, 40,941 bales, 65,934 bales.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Domestic Green Sugar Plunges 1-2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, coarse sand white and others were still stable. Domestic green sugar was as weak as before. The guild’s drawing board 24 coarse sand white ordinary spot goods 18 yuan, 7 jiao, 8 fen. Local plant goods were 18 yuan, 8 jiao, 8 fen. Transshipment customs warehouse goods were 5 yuan, 2 jiao. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 19 yuan, 2 jiao, about 2 jiao lower than before. The local factory's cotton white was firm. No. 1 was 18 yuan, 1 jiao. No. 2 was 17 yuan, 9 jiao. No. 3 was 17 yuan, 7 jiao and a half. No. 4 was 17 yuan, 6 jiao and a half. There were Guangdong gangs who opened more than 600 boxes of Beihai flake green goods at 9 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the high price. Jian gang opened new Diaoqing goods at 10 yuan, about 1 yuan lower than the previous board. Tong'an Qing was 9 yuan, 6 jiao, a decrease of 1 yuan and a half. More than 700 bags were transacted. The Chao gang opened one hundred and several tens of packages of Chaoqing goods, Huanggang Qing at 10 yuan and a half, Longqing at 10 yuan, and second-class goods at 9 yuan and 8 jiao, about 1 yuan lower. According to this market price, it has fallen by about 2 yuan before and after, and the customers and goods must lose money. It may be temporarily transferred to stability.</p>
<h3>Fabric and Wool Market Conditions Are Greatly Different from the Past</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics and wool textiles: According to past practice, after the end of the national lunar year, there is often a large sales market for overcoat woolen fabrics, and the Sichuan gang also often opens spring goods. At present, it is very different from the past. The Sichuan gang does not move at all. Overcoat woolen fabric street sales are sluggish, and the price of goods has fallen and not risen. The capital of the colleagues has become tight. Looking at the accounts at the end of the national lunar year, it is more than half as good as in previous years. In addition, the Western clothing gang's bank checks are full of refunds. Even the goods purchased one or two months ago are often requested to be returned because there is no money when the accounts are received. In short, the dire situation of the market is very different from the past. It is even worse than the "January 28th" Shanghai battle.</p>

<h3>Chinese Song and Dance in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Feng Yongtang</p>
<p>(1) A General Discussion of Song and Dance (Business Perspective)</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, the Chinese song and dance scene has already embarked on a path of decline. Bare thighs and exposed breasts are no longer easy to sell, and lewd songs and seductive dances have also nearly lost their appeal. Song and dance troupes that go to various places to perform mostly return in miserable defeat. If the song and dance troupe owners are wealthy young masters, they can still afford to lose their capital, but if they are some wandering (performers), they will even lose their (costumes) after a business failure. The situation of song and dance troupes has not changed much to this day. Generally speaking, this year's song and dance scene is still shrouded in an atmosphere of recession. Several famous song and dance troupes have not earned much money in their few performances. Now, I might as well briefly mention a few song and dance performances in Shanghai.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk about the Plum Blossom Troupe. The (Plum Blossom Troupe) is a well-known name in the song and dance scene. Two years ago, Plum Blossom was equally impoverished, but since returning from a tour in Singapore and other places in Southeast Asia, the troupe owner has moved into a Western-style house and drives a car. (In Southeast Asia, song and dance are still relatively rare. The reason why the Plum Blossom Troupe could make money this time is because overseas Chinese still don't see enough of bare thighs. But this year, the (Shanghai Technical Song and Dance Troupe) went to Southeast Asia, and the situation was a bit different.) This year, Plum Blossom also held several performances, but the business situation was not very good. In May, they performed so-called (1934-style song and dance) at the Jincheng Grand Theater. The advertisements boasted loudly, saying: (Beautiful women fill the eyes, with thousands of charming postures, once you appreciate the sound, you won't taste meat for three months. If you want to explore the heart of the plum blossom, now is the time!) All kinds of fragrant words and seductive phrases are enough to scare people away. Who with artistic cultivation would dare to come and learn? The (featured play) this time was (Love School), a ridiculous and fanciful song and dance drama, which did not attract much attention. At the end of July, following the Xinhua Opera Troupe, the Plum Blossom Troupe performed at the Xinguang Theater again. This performance lasted for a considerable period, from July 27th to August 13th, a total of 18 days, and the program was changed several times. Although there were many spectators, they were not very enthusiastic, and the business was not very prosperous. The reason why they could perform for so many days was due to other reasons. It turned out that the business of movie theaters was generally sluggish during the summer vacation. At that time, Xinguang was planning to) close for the summer). Since song and dance could still attract a portion of erotic audiences and there was money to be made, there was nothing wrong with maintaining it for a few more days. This performance of Plum Blossom, whether in terms of talent or program, was on a larger scale than the one at Jincheng. In order to make everyone understand the song and dance situation a little more, I would like to introduce it well. The actors who appeared on stage this time, in addition to the (starring) (hot girl) Miss Xu Canying, also included Zhang Qi, Zhang Xianlin, Cai Yiming, Fan Lixiang, Pan Wenxia, Pan Wenjuan, Qian Zhongxiu, Jia Qiuyun, and Weng Lanxue, among others. The so-called (Five Tiger Generals, Four Diamond Warriors) were among them. In terms of program, there were (the latest great creation) (A Spring Dream), (exquisite and unparalleled) (Playing), (rich and fragrant) (Yang Guifei), (The Scandalous History of Xuan Palace), (witty and stimulating) (Backstage), (immortal) (Seven Emotions). These were all featured plays, brought out one after another. Plum Blossom can be said to have pulled out all the goods in the world, such as a graceful dance, a charming dance, (Wave Dance), (Jade Rabbit Dance), (Grass Skirt Dance), (Javanese Girl), (Black and White Dance), (Spanish Dance), (Charleston Dance), (Tap Dance), (Lia Dance), (Butterfly Dance), (Clang Dance), Sailor Dance)······ such as (Night Fragrance), (Spring is Full of the Garden), (Blooming Flowers), (Flowers Bloom For You), (Fruit of Love), (Spring Night Song), (Butterfly Shadows), (I Can't Forget You), (Playing Dragon and Phoenix), (Love Companion), (New Drizzle), (Double Flight), (Pleasure of Youth), (Pursuit), (In the Night Garden), (White Powder and Black Paint), (Marry a Warrior)······ these, whether dance, song, or drama, are all fragrant and charming. Just hearing these names is fragrant and charming enough!</p>
<p>Not long ago, Plum Blossom also performed in a small theater in this city, but this has never attracted people's attention, and the scale is also very small, so I don't plan to mention it here anymore.</p>
<p>The Xinhua Opera Troupe also held a so-called (the greatest song and dance performance in history for the first time) from July 20th to 23rd, and also pulled in many female stars for (guest appearances). The grand occasion at that time can be imagined. In terms of talent, if Misses Yuan Meiyun, Li Lili, Bai Hong, Hu Jia, Li Mingjian, Cang Yinqiu, and Jiang Manli are all very talented, and if they can get good guidance, they can indeed have a future in (song) and (dance). Xu Jian, Yu Hua, Ye Ying, and Ouyang Feili of Xinhua Society are all smart girls and have a lot of potential: it's a pity that they haven't cherished their talents and haven't gone in the direction of new singing and new dancing, which is inevitably a loss. For example, this public performance of Xinhua lacks new goods, and most of the programs are leftovers inherited from the Mingyue Society. What (Swan Dance), (Milky Way Dance), (Bubble Dance)······ what (Flower of Love), (Night Fragrance), (Four Angels), (Physical Exercise), (Fair Trade), (Returning Home in Wind and Rain), (Modern Love), (Secrets of Courtship), (Under the Sword), (Special Express), etc., we cannot give them too high an evaluation, although some of them, such as the children's song and dance drama (Special Express), are relatively worth watching. Naturally, this time was relatively marketable.</p>
<p>At the same time as Plum Blossom's performance at Xinguang (early August), Xinhua and the Qunyan Song and Dance Troupe (led) by (Oriental Locke) Shao Zhuanglin also jointly performed at the Guangdong Grand Theater in Hongkou. Although a few new people were added this time, the program was still the same old stuff, and the business was also very ordinary, so I don't plan to explain it here anymore. In addition, there are some small song and dance troupes, such as (Yinhua) (Mingming) (Huaguang) (Taohua) (Jimei) (Lengyan), etc., either performing in amusement parks such as the Great World or second- and third-class theaters in this city, or going to other places to wander for a while, but none of them have improved much, so there is no need to talk about them here. In short, if the song and dance scene does not open up new avenues, they will not be able to break through the current atmosphere of recession and achieve something.</p>
<p>(2) The Entry and Exit of Song and Dance in the Film Industry</p>
<p>The fact that song and dance does not have much of a future is a clear fact, which cannot be avoided. It is a natural result for the song and dance scene to run to the film industry and broadcasting industry to cultivate its power for its own future. I will not talk about the activities of the song and dance scene in broadcasting for the time being; in the film industry, after the American Warner Company's (Forty-Second Street) and other song and dance films made money, the domestic song and dance film (Human Fairy) was also able to make a little money. As a result, some people in the song and dance scene organized their own film companies to shoot films, and some joined film companies and became stars. For example, some people in the Plum Blossom Troupe organized another Plum Blossom Film Company and started shooting (Song of the Rose), and also made a joke of trying to be clever but failing. Originally, the protagonist of the film, Pan Wenxia, was unknown. In order to attract attention, the host arranged a fake lawsuit, offered a reward, and made a lot of noise, which was known to everyone in the city. In addition, many people from the Mingyue Society, Xinhua Society, and Plum Blossom Troupe have also gone to the screen. Bai Hong and Li Mingjian of the Mingyue Society have already performed in (Human Fairy), and Yin Ying has performed in (Physical Exercise); in addition to Pan Wenxia, Pan Wenjuan, Xu Canying, and Fan Lixiang of the Plum Blossom Troupe have all played important roles in films. Many members of the Xinhua Society have played supporting roles and moving scenery in several films of Tianyi this year. Huang, the owner of the Plum Blossom Troupe, also has a plan to equip a sound machine and take the troupe to foreign countries to shoot films at any time, which is currently underway.</p>
<p>The advance of song and dance into the film industry did not start today. Three or four years ago, Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Hu Jia, etc. had already jumped onto the screen, and even earlier there was Li Minghui, but at that time it was not just performing song and dance films. In the future, domestic song and dance films may form a trend, but this also depends on the content and technology, especially the technology. Without Hollywood's huge capital, some crudely made things, hoping to be as marketable as (Forty-Second Street), I'm afraid it won't happen, right? The audience can only be deceived once. From this point of view, the future of Chinese song and dance films is also very bleak.</p>
<p>(3) Also a Major Event</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I remembered another interesting thing. Everyone probably still remembers the song star contest on the Big Evening News this summer, right? Here, I'm going to talk about it. This election took more than a month, and the voters can be said to have been very enthusiastic. Every week, the election results were announced, and Bai Hong of the Mingyue Society and Zhou Xuan of the Xinhua Society received the most votes. As a result, Bai Hong was elected first with 9,103 votes, Zhou Xuan was elected second with 8,876 votes, and Wang Manjie was elected third with 8,854 votes. These three are the (three major song stars) we are familiar with now. These little girls, who usually don't attract much attention, actually have tens of thousands of people supporting them, which is a bit strange, but maybe it's really because they sing well? I have to admit that their voices are quite promising: but I think they don't necessarily really understand music. I once saw someone satirize the (three major song stars), saying that at a certain amusement park held in Xu Garden on Kang Nao Tu Road, there was an English song solo program by one of the (three major song stars). Two blue-eyed gentlemen in the audience stood up and left their seats as soon as they heard the singing. This is probably not because the two foreign gentlemen didn't understand English songs, right? Undoubtedly, this is their lack of understanding of singing. They should study in more depth and never regard some currently popular vulgar modern songs as treasures, because these things have no high value in music (their dances are also of little value).</p>
<p>(4) Final Remarks</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I must add a point about the future of Chinese new song and dance. Song, dance, and song and dance dramas are undoubtedly necessary, but they are definitely not what Chinese song and dance can currently fill. We need song and dance with new content and forms. We don't need song and dance that sells bare thighs and breasts, and sells sensuality. All lewd lyrics and seductive tunes, grotesque shapes and strange forms, are poisons that anesthetize and harm young people. They should have no place in real song and dance and should be eliminated. Real song and dance should not just imitate a little bit of the superficiality of foreign jazz music and a little bit of foreign seductive dance postures. It should have a higher level of musical foundation, more complex melody coordination, more powerful and beautiful body postures that can represent a national character, and collective forms of dance postures. I hope that people who work hard in song and dance will improve or create new Chinese song and dance from this other direction!</p>

<h3>Chinese Film in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xia Zhende</p>
<p>There have been particularly many events in the film industry this year, making a detailed account impossible within this short space. Now, I only want to briefly describe a few of the most important aspects and prominent issues.</p>
<p>(1) Overview of the Film Industry: Following the global wave of economic recession, the Chinese film industry has gradually reached a critical point of decline over the past year. Whether in terms of film companies or theaters, most have entered a state of struggle. Let's start with the film companies. The Chinese film industry is concentrated in Shanghai, where Mingxing, Lianhua, Tianyi, and Yihua are the giants not only of Shanghai but of the entire Chinese film industry, as we all know. The business conditions of these companies have always been kept secret and never disclosed to the outside world, but we can infer a general idea from the box office performance of their films. After the success of "Sister Flowers" this year, Mingxing Company seemed more active, establishing a "Revival Comrades Association" on April 1st to plan for revival and debt repayment. However, Mingxing's other films this year, such as "Two Against One," "A Woman's Enemy," "Youth Line," and "Golden Valley," did not perform as well at the box office. Later, although the company managed to make up for some of the losses with the relatively successful "Daughter's Classic," featuring the entire cast, and "Madam Mai," which had technical shortcomings, it was still far from the path to revival. Lianhua's "Song of the Fishermen" undoubtedly achieved the greatest commercial success this year, but other films such as "The Road to Light," "Iron Bird," "Black Heart Talisman," "Panorama of Southeast Asia," and "Youth" did not perform particularly well at the box office. Tianyi was able to sustain its business because it produced mostly sound films, facing little competition, but this was also due in part to the cleverness of its managers. For example, they were known to produce a film in the shortest possible time with the smallest possible budget. Yihua is a rising star, having released only six films to date: "Rage of the Chinese Sea," "Flames," "The Golden Age," "Woman," "Fairy of the World," and "Flying Flower Village." However, its capital base is quite solid, and "Woman" and "Fairy of the World" were somewhat successful at the box office, so it was perhaps less affected by the economic downturn.</p>
<p>However, the entire Chinese film industry is still struggling. Most companies are adopting austerity policies, and unpaid wages are a common reality. The number of productions is also decreasing step by step, and the trend of cutting corners and producing shoddy work is widespread.</p>
<p>Currently, the film companies' market territory is shrinking day by day, and this has reached a point beyond salvation. Previously, the best overseas markets were the Dutch and British territories in Southeast Asia and Siam, Annam, and the Philippines. Now, the film industry is suffering deeply in these regions, and the livelihood of overseas Chinese is becoming increasingly difficult. Naturally, the film business has plummeted. In the interior, theaters have been affected by the increasing poverty of the society and the impact of exorbitant taxes. Closures due to the inability to afford films are not uncommon. Here, I might as well insert a brief overview of the theater business. Most of the theaters in the cities of the interior are now on the road to closure. For example, in Chengdu, three of the five theaters closed in November of this year, and the remaining two were ordered to close in December by the municipal authorities due to arrears in provincial and municipal medical donations. Of the six theaters in Hankou, only "World" can barely sustain itself, while the rest have either collapsed or are like candles in the wind. The theaters in Guangzhou bear five types of taxes: theater tax, entertainment tax, entertainment stamp tax, advertising tax, and business tax. Unable to bear the burden, they face the risk of complete closure. Even in Shanghai, where there is supposedly gold everywhere, the theater business is not very prosperous. Some first-run theaters have been reduced to second-run theaters, and some have signed exclusive screening rights with film companies for a fixed period. As for internal cost-cutting measures and attempts to save on advertising expenses, these are all in the calculations of theater owners. In such a situation, how can the film companies' market not shrink day by day? Moreover, since the fall of the four northeastern provinces, the vast film market is no longer ours. Even in the war zones and nearby areas, people have little spare money to seek entertainment. How can the film business not plummet?</p>
<p>Due to this situation, film companies have had to make some changes in their film production policies. In the selection of themes, the depiction of the hardships of ordinary people's lives and the powerful exposure of reality will become a way to win cultural and commercial success, and will become the goal of progressive practitioners. On the other hand, the methods of cutting corners and producing shoddy work will inevitably be innovated and diversified. New films featuring the entire cast will become popular, and all kinds of novel and economical methods will be adopted by producers. Although this shows their struggle in distress, it is precisely their step onto the road to self-destruction.</p>
<p>(2) A Glimpse of New Films: This year, Lianhua has released nine productions, Mingxing has released twenty-one, Tianyi has released thirteen, Yihua has released six, and Diantong has released one. In addition, small companies such as Great Wall, Yulian, Tianma, Tianbei, Liangyou, Kuaihuolin, Daguangming, Jinan, Hualun, and Jimei have also produced one or two works each. Among these fewer than one hundred works, there are naturally a few good films, but the number of shoddy and inferior works is at least more than double the number of good films. The works of small companies often imitate successful films made by others. Naturally, some of these imitations are well done, but in general, due to limited manpower and financial resources, their efforts often do not achieve excellent results. What is most inappropriate is that some of them secretly produce martial arts and supernatural films behind closed doors. We don't need to mention that for now. As for the films of the major companies, we don't need to talk about them one by one. Now, I just want to briefly mention a few films that have attracted the attention of the general public. First, I want to talk about "Sister Flowers." "Sister Flowers" is a film that broke the world's box office record by running for two months. Naturally, it has something to satisfy the audience's demands. This is a "bitter drama" without "love" or "sensuality." The reason why it can move the audience is that it allows ordinary people to vent their feelings of distress, that it satirizes reality, and that it embellishes a bit of progressive consciousness. In fact, this work does not have a high degree of technical completion. Both the directing and the performances are partly melodramatic, and this is something that the producers themselves admit.</p>
<p>"Song of the Fishermen" ran for more than eighty days and can be considered the most sensational film of the year. This is also a "bitter drama." It is a source of tears for distressed ordinary people and a refreshing agent for venting their pent-up emotions. Although the author's improved perspective failed to give the audience much healthy feeling, the author's technical cultivation was also able to satisfy the audience and send them home happy.</p>
<p>In addition, Lianhua's "Life," "Wind," "Fragrant Snow Sea," "Goodbye Shanghai," Mingxing's "Salt Tide," "Roadside Willows and Wall Flowers," "Daughter's Classic," "Twenty-Four Hours in Shanghai," "Reborn Flower," Tianyi's "Mr. Wang," "Hundred Flower Island," Yihua's "Rage of the Chinese Sea," "Flames," "Woman," "Fairy of the World," and Diantong's "Peach and Plum Calamity" have all attracted the attention of the general public, but these films cannot be said to be our excellent harvest in 1934. Compared with the massive production and high technical completion of European and American film industries, these films are really insignificant and unworthy of mention.</p>
<p>(3) Several New Trends in Film Production: The Chinese film industry is still very young, but Chinese cinema is not without hope. For example, the progress of Chinese cinema in the past two or three years is undeniable. If Chinese cinema can continue to develop according to the recent situation, it will naturally have a future. However, recently there are indeed many things in the Chinese film industry that cannot but be disappointing. The Chinese film industry has gradually embarked on the wrong path. Due to the sensation of American musical films such as "42nd Street," "Gold Diggers," "Fashions of 1934," and "Wonder Bar," a few Chinese filmmakers are also imitating them, starting to show off sensuality. Following "Fairy of the World," we have the production of films such as "Physical Exercise," "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance," and "Song of Roses." This is undoubtedly harmful to the new Chinese cinema. Chinese cinema really has no need to step into the American-style vortex of lasciviousness and depravity again. Secondly, because "Mr. Wang" can make money, envious people then came up with "Goody Goody," "Wine, Women, Wealth, and Temper," "Aviation Saves the Country," etc., and "Mr. Wang's Secret" is also waiting to be produced. Perhaps new tricks will be turned out in the future. But we must know that comedy films are extremely difficult to produce. The current vulgar, boring, opportunistic, and contrived comedies are really not movies, but a waste of movies. Also, the romance films of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly genre are now showing a tendency to resurface. Tianyi's "Happy Enemies" and "Like Passing Water" are all works of this type, and there are now news that several film companies are taking out these long-shelved film scripts and starting to shoot them again. This is really an unwise act of reversing the trend, because the fact that these films cannot make money has already been proven.</p>
<p>(4) The Flourishing of Film Periodicals: The publication of film periodicals this year can be said to be all the rage. Almost all major newspapers in Shanghai have a film supplement or publish film articles. The Min Bao ("Film Talk") and the Zhonghua Daily ("Ginza") are both newly opened "silver lands" this year. In addition, the Shen Bao ("Film Special Issue"), the Xinwen Bao ("Art Sea"), the Chen Bao ("Daily Film"), the Shishi Xin Bao ("New Shanghai Film Column"), the Shi Bao ("Film Edition"), and the Shanghai Shang Bao ("Silver General Assembly") all specialize in publishing film articles. The evening newspapers, such as the Da Wan Bao ("Silhouette"), ("Sunday Film"), the Da Mei Wan Bao ("Silver Flower"), ("Film Weekly"), the Shi Bao ("Film Journal") ("Weekly"), the Xinwen Ye Bao ("Film Weekly"), the Xin Ye Bao ("Black Eyes") (later renamed "Silver Standard"), and the Shehui Wan Bao ("Film Issue"), are mostly film supplements of their respective newspapers. Stand-alone film publications have also sprung up like mushrooms. This year, we have seen the following monthly magazines: "Film Pictorial," "Era Film," "Modern Film," "Qingqing Film," "Drama and Film," etc. The weekly magazines include "Film Fan Weekly," "Electric Sound," "Film Pictures," etc. The bi-monthly magazines include "Film World," etc. These have all helped to expand the array of film culture to some extent. The film pages in the pictorials are also quite able to arouse people's interest. This year, each pictorial, such as "Liangyou" (recently issued a "Film Special Issue"), "Era," "Art Life," "Greater Shanghai," "China," "Wenhua," "Dazhong," "New Tide," and the rigid "China Monthly," etc., have paid great attention to the publication of film photographs to help people pass the time after tea and dinner. The small newspapers also mostly publish film articles as a gimmick, but most of them only record the daily life of some directors and stars, or promote film companies, or scold people, and are not of much value, but it is not bad to take a look. In short, film has been noticed by a wide audience. Various publications will lose part of their appeal if they do not publish film articles or pictures. It is no wonder that the popularity of film publications has become a recent trend.</p>
<p>(5) Film Criticism and its Future: Now we want to talk about film criticism. This year, the film critics have experienced one storm after another, from the dispute over soft and hard criticism to the discovery of pseudo-experts. After countless battles, large and small, the aftermath has not yet subsided. The reason for this is naturally the shifting of the times, which has drawn a wide chasm of ideological differences. Disputes are unavoidable and very necessary. And this kind of dispute has indeed helped new film criticism. The realism of film criticism and the issue of film criticism standards are constantly raised in the debate, which just exposes the faces of some (technical criticisms) that erase content, some (records) that are close to promoting theaters, or so-called (criticisms) that praise to the sky. However, this has also aroused the jealousy of a few film companies, who have instigated publicists to shout the slogan "No Film Criticism" in an attempt to attack film criticism. Although their plan has not succeeded, the film critics have become more and more motivated, and have tried their best to open up a new and beneficial future for film criticism in the cordial attitude of film criticism writing and in the popularization of film criticism language.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other major and minor events this year, such as the Nanjing Capital Theater cutting "Daughter's Classic" and restoring "Rape," the film supplements of various newspapers, such as foreign investment in China to film (foreign investment in China to film include the Pudong Sino-Foreign Film Company, the Jiangwan China Film Company, etc.), such as MGM Wah filming "The Good Earth" on location, such as the sensational Xue Yuan (seduction case), Hong Ying's (confession) incident, as well as Ai Xia's suicide, Wang Ying's departure abroad, down to the poor lives of ordinary movie stars, the opening of film companies ...... I can't finish writing, I can't finish talking, so let's stop here.</p>
<h3>Next Issue Preview</h3>

We hope that all readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Chinese Music Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Wang Daping</p>
<p>Looking at Chinese music over the past year from one perspective, it has made significant progress. However, from another perspective, it also shows its irredeemable decline. There have been many developments in music this year. Now, I will discuss the aspects that show progress and decline.</p>
<p>1.  Music in Film</p>
<p>Within its own domain, there isn’t much to mention about music this year. If we are to discuss its progress this year, it would be in its use in films. We all know that talkies are more popular than silent films, but songs, background music, and even sound effects are inseparable from music in talkies. In this context, music is undoubtedly the soul of the film. This year, the music (songs) in domestic talkies, apart from a few songs in films like *Twin Sisters* and *Peach and Plum Calamity*, have largely gone unnoticed. This is naturally due to the poor content and technical quality of the songs. However, the situation changed dramatically with the release of *Fisherman's Song* in the silent film *Song of the Fishermen*. Its sensational impact even created a trend where later films needed music to be successful. Although the composer Ms. An E has said that the success of *Fisherman's Song* was just a "lucky accident," the reality is that the song's realistic content, sorrowful melody, organized composition, and its alignment with the realistic subject matter of the film were all reasons for its sensation. After *Fisherman's Song*, it was a long time before we heard songs like *Graduation Song* from *Peach and Plum Calamity*, *The Road Song*, *Pioneering Song*, *Fengyang Song*, and *Yan Yan Song* from *The Highway*, and *Flying Flower Song* and *Shepherd's Song* from *Flying Flower Village*. Among these, *The Road Song* and *Pioneering Song* are particularly noteworthy for their vigor, novelty, heroism, and pathos. These popular songs should be considered rare productions in the Chinese music scene of 1934.</p>
<p>In addition, there were also some dialogue-singing films from the Star Film Company and Tianyi Film Company, such as *Rebirth Flower*, *Renzhu*, *Red Mansion Spring Deep*, *Spring Night Song*, *Songstress's Scandal*, etc., which also had some songs in them, but these did not attract much attention or have much impact musically.</p>
<p>2.  Music in Broadcasting</p>
<p>If broadcasting had no music, it would probably be difficult to attract people's attention and achieve any effect. Most listeners are probably unwilling to listen to educational programs (such as lessons in Mandarin, Chinese studies, English, and primary and secondary school materials) because the material is very dry and not accompanied by music. Drama broadcasts are also unlikely to be effective without good background music. The importance of music in broadcasting can be imagined.</p>
<p>The current state of music broadcasting can be described as shallow, immature, and of little value. The most popular figures in the broadcasting world now are ballad singers, Shanghai opera singers, and female singers. What they broadcast is outdated and harmful. It is impossible to hear anything of value from them. In particular, some of the female announcers only know how to sing a few sentimental popular songs. They do not understand vocal music, and their voices have many flaws. Some of them don't even understand rhythm and beat, let alone anything else. In this state, music has long ceased to exist in the broadcasting world.</p>
<p>Those experts who reside in academies have also gone to the broadcasting stations this year. Students from the National Conservatory of Music had to broadcast a music program once a month in the first half of this year. From the first week of October this year to the first week of June 1935, it was stipulated that music should be broadcast once a week, with the time set from 8:00 PM to 8:45 PM every Friday evening. The programs included ten types: lectures, commemorative programs, music teaching materials, folk songs, art songs, simple art instrumental music, art music, old Chinese music, and new compositions. However, these programs are difficult to attract people's attention among the many bizarre broadcasting programs.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra also holds broadcasts now. The broadcasting location is at the Westerner’s XOHA radio station, with the time being 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM every other Tuesday evening, and 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM every Friday evening.</p>
<p>In addition, some film songs such as *Fisherman's Song* and *Twin Sisters* are also broadcast a lot, especially *Fisherman's Song*, which has become almost a household name through the broadcasts of various radio stations. This can be said to be a more pleasing thing.</p>
<p>3.  Music Concerts</p>
<p>Music concerts are often held in music academies and can be encountered constantly in society. During the summer, the Municipal Council Orchestra often holds performances in various parks in the city. Music experts also occasionally hold music concerts, and students from other schools occasionally come to the city to hold concerts. The Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra has always been very famous in the city and holds several music seasons every year. The most recent one started on October 21st, located at the Lyceum Theatre in the French Concession, with the time on Sunday evenings. At the end of November, when the film *Loves of a Musician*, which depicts the love story of the 19th-century musician Schubert, was screened in Shanghai, the orchestra also performed at the venue. The music school holds many concerts. A larger-scale one was the concert held on November 26th to commemorate the school's seventh anniversary, located in the auditorium on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. The performance lasted for four hours, which shows the richness of the program. However, the piano ensemble and Liao Jun's violin solo were particularly unsuccessful in this concert. What was very noticeable in this concert was the Russian composer Tcherepnin's request for submissions of piano pieces with Chinese flavor for a prize. The first prize winner, He Luting, played his work, *The Shepherd's Flute*, in person at the time, which was highly praised by Tcherepnin. In December of this year, the school held another concert of works by teachers and students. This concert also had shortcomings, but there were still many good performances. From this concert, it can be seen that the musicians of the school are working hard on the mixing and harmonization of Chinese and Western music. Chinese music ensembles are also often a program of the school's concerts. This shows a glimpse of the school's efforts.</p>
<p>What must also be mentioned is the performance of Chinese music by the Datong Music Society, which is quite famous in society, on August 27th to commemorate Confucius' birthday. According to experts' criticisms, the performance was a complete failure, and the music played, *Zhonghe Shaoyue*, failed to resonate with the audience. The reason for this can be attributed to the lack of proficiency in performance techniques, the poor quality of the instruments, and the lack of musical value of the music itself (the entire piece of *Zhonghe Shaoyue* is just a simple tune without harmony).</p>
<p>Finally, I have to mention the first record listening session of the "New Voice Society" of the Pathé Records Company in October. This is a listening session for recorded records, not a concert, but I take its similarity and do not want to create a separate title, so I can only talk about it here. The songs we heard this time were *The Road Song*, *Pioneering Song*, *Graduation Song*, and songs from the new opera *Storm on the Dnieper River*. We can hear these songs now. The feeling they give us is very different from some popular songs. There is no decadent music here, only heroism and strength. The lyrics and melody, both in content and form, are very well matched, which cannot be done by a group of people who are good at copying.</p>
<p>4.  Music Publishing</p>
<p>In the past year, music publications have not been abundant in quantity, and the quality is even more pitifully poor. In order to promote themselves, film companies have given away the film songs when the films were released, not only directly to the audience but also through bookstores and other institutions to the public. But this does not mean that there is any vitality in the Chinese music publishing industry. In reality, this is just a "business eye" of film companies and theater owners. Mr. Li Jinhui, the most prolific and influential composer in China (whether this influence is good or bad will be discussed later), has also printed quite a few song collections this year. For example, the Tong Sheng Song Collection published by Tong Sheng Bookstore has more than a dozen volumes, with a total of no less than three or four hundred new songs, which can be called a major event. These song collections all have sweet or grand names, such as *Whispers of a Girl*, *Five Dozen Sweet Songs*, *Spring Song in a Small Building*, *Qingfeng Song Collection*, *Humming Collection*, *Roar of the Tiger Mountain*, *Songs of Warriors*, etc. It is said that the content is quite able to cultivate emotions and increase the joy of life, but whether it really has this effect is not something I know.</p>
<p>In addition, many film songs from China and abroad have also been printed and sold by speculators. The ones we are most likely to see are *Twin Sisters* and *Fisherman's Song*, etc. There are also film songs and songs from many years ago printed together in one book, such as *Human Fairy* and *Peach Blossom River*, etc., printed together in one book, which is also often seen. Gao Tianqi and Ma Rouxuan (who has withdrawn) of Tianyi Film Company used the name of the 123 Music Research Association to print a *New Lullaby* this year, printing out the songs from many talkies from Tianyi Film Company from *Spring in the Singing Field* to 1933. Jazz music concerts have also published many jazz music books. In addition, there are inevitably some new songs published, but there is no need to go into detail about them here. As for music theory books, they are even scarcer. We still find it difficult to name a few valuable music books.</p>
<p>In short, the Chinese music publishing industry is still very young and backward. We are not yet able to access valuable music scores and works. This will depend on the efforts of music students.</p>
<p>5.  A Brief Record of Musical Debates</p>
<p>At the end of October, an article by Ting Shi, *From Musical Art to China's Pragmatism*, was published in the *Music Weekly* of the *New Evening News*. This immediately attracted the attention of a Mr. Mu Hua in the *Trend* of the *China Daily*, who wrote an article, *Opposing the Poison of an Idealist Applied to Music*, to refute it. Then the two sides began to argue, using pens as swords, stirring up a few rounds of debate. Ting Shi's original opinion was to value the spiritual life of the West. He put forward two requirements: conditional restoration of the old and balancing the spiritual life and material life of the people. Mu Hua pointed out that spiritual life cannot be independent of material life. Under the current economic situation of gradual collapse, the material life of the people cannot be balanced at all. Ting Shi's proposal to balance the material life and spiritual life of the people is not only futile but also harmful. Mu Hua also pointed out Ting Shi's definition of restoration of the old and the confluence of the restoration movement, saying that this is also harmful. Ting Shi later replied that "I want to declare that I have never asked for restoration of the old." In this way, the so-called "restoration of the old" problem has lost its target. Regarding the issue of balancing material life and spiritual life, Ting Shi also declared that he is also dissatisfied with the current material life, but he believes that to transform material life, it is not necessary to start with a frontal reform of material life, but to start with balance. But Mu Hua retorted that this is the result of his not understanding the decisive relationship of material life to spiritual life. In fact, even if he wants to balance, he may not be able to do it.</p>
<p>This debate did not develop well, and the result was only this. Who is right and who is wrong, no third party came out to judge or participate in the discussion later.</p>
<p>6.  Prospects for the Future of Music</p>
<p>Although the Chinese music scene in 1934 has not had a bountiful harvest, its bright future has already been foreshadowed. The new shoots of new music will continue to grow, and popular vulgar songs are inevitably about to come to an end. High-level music has gradually attracted the attention of people in society. Popular music, through movies, has gradually been accepted and welcomed by the general public. Although the currently popular vulgar music can still be prominent in the broadcasting and dance circles for a while, this phenomenon is showing that it cannot be maintained for a long time. This can be proved by looking at the two things that even the "ancestors" of the dance circles have organized a "New Song Broadcasting Society" and the music teams of dance halls have degenerated into the same rut. This has fully shown that this kind of thing is just for people to enjoy and has little value.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the talk is over. Finally, I must declare that I personally do not "care" about music. There may be errors and omissions in what I have said here, and I would like to ask the readers to correct me.</p>

<h3>A Week's Trip Back Home (Continued and Finished)</h3>
<p>— Su Gang</p>
<p>The boat owner, with a cigarette holder in his mouth, was scolding just like he did on the boat, his eyebrows furrowed and standing up straight like Huang Tianba on the stage. The moment he saw me jump into the water, he hurriedly swam over, his face full of smiles, and said to me, "Sir, I'm really sorry to have made you suffer from the cold... Hey! Look, how can so many big guys be put together in one place? Sir, taking this kind of boat is just not good, you always have to get into the water. Now business is not good, and I don't dare to hire too many boatmen. The boat can't be lifted without the guests getting into the water. Look, more than thirty people can't move it!" His two thick black eyebrows locked into one again, he sighed, and then looked at the dozens of boatmen and scolded them for a while.</p>
<p>The boatmen's faces showed various expressions with the boat owner's scolding, their mouths opening and tilting like river fish. Bamboo poles as thick as bowls were stretched across the front and back of the boat, and more than thirty people were divided into four groups, carrying the boat like a sedan chair. After a tragic shout of "Ah yo yo! Lift yo!", the boat only moved a foot or so.</p>
<p>The few guests in the front cabin, who were happy to see this, hurried over to help the boatmen lift the boat.</p>
<p>The boat owner looked at it and smiled, and said to me, "Sir, haven't you ever done this before? Haha!" He laughed wildly for a while, then put the cigarette holder in his mouth again and sucked it vigorously.</p>
<p>The boat gradually moved away from the bottom of the river, and only the heads of the boatmen were left on the surface of the water. A few boatmen at the front of the boat scrambled to jump on the boat to take the punting poles, and the boat gradually became active.</p>
<p>I jumped onto the boat after them, and felt a bone-chilling coldness all over my body, and shivered immediately. Many boatmen looked at me and laughed and said, "Sir, you're so afraid of the cold, that's terrible! There's a lot more to come ahead!"</p>
<p>"Um!" I responded casually.</p>
<p>I hurriedly put on my clothes and walked out of the cabin, standing at the bow of the boat and looking around for a while. I rarely saw other boats coming and going on the river. Along the river, the fields were full of grass several feet high. As far as I could see, I couldn't see a single village. It was desolate and quiet, which made me think of another world!</p>
<p>I stared blankly for a while, and couldn't help but feel a sense of cursing and sadness!</p>
<p>The boatmen, as if forgetting the fatigue just now, were making a fuss on the bow of the boat in twos and threes. Some were singing love songs from their hometown, and some were sucking on their cigarette holders. The bow of the boat was full of cheerful emotions.</p>
<p>"How much further do we have to go before we have to get into the water again?" I walked to the old boatman and asked.</p>
<p>"Early! If the wind is strong, we will have to get into the water at night. If it doesn't go well, it may be tomorrow morning!" he said while smoking his cigarette.</p>
<p>"What is that beach called ahead? How many more beaches do we have to cross before we get to Guixi?" I asked worriedly.</p>
<p>"That one doesn't have a name, but the shallow places are called 'beaches'. There are still five or six times that the boat will have to be lifted before we get to Guixi. Alas! It's really killing!" he sighed and shook his head.</p>
<p>"That's terrible! There are still so many beaches..."</p>
<p>Before I could finish speaking, he snatched the words and said, "Sir, is that a lot? Hey, if you go to Ganzhou, that's a lot more - Eighteen Beaches! Hey! The water flows so fast there! Eighteen Beaches!"</p>
<p>"It's not easy to be a boatman! Lifting boats, won't that kill people?" I sighed in surprise.</p>
<p>"What can we do? We rely on lifting boats to eat! After we pass Guixi, we don't have to do it anymore. We all go ashore there. We have a life again when the 'fast boats' from Nanchang pass Guixi. Alas! It's not something people do!" He touched his beard twice with his hand, and then said, "From the time I was a child, living to this long beard, I'm still relying on my shoulders to eat in this place. Really, I'm ashamed to death!" Tears flowed from his withered eye sockets.</p>
<p>"Um, it's not easy to eat!" Just as I said this, I heard them shouting for dinner in the cabin. (End)</p>

Because I was too greedy, I didn't want to paint it quickly, so I could look at her more. As a result, it took a week to complete it, and I felt it was very beautiful and divine. It can be considered my most proud work in my life. Xu Wen asked her to be my model and paint a picture of going to the country to save the country together.

<p>Opening (Shanghai Night)</p>
<p>The spring shade is dark, nearing dusk. Thousands of households light their lamps. Shanghai's prosperity is said to be the greatest. Neon lights illuminate the six streets. One can see the three company rooftops as bright as a painting. The amusement parks are bustling at their peak. The theaters open with a crowd like carps. Reserved boxes are sought until nearly three in the morning. Several Beijing-Suzhou restaurants are just starting banquets. In high spirits, flowers are requested to accompany the guests. Brothel doors compete in extravagance. Red and blue intermingle, clearly distinguishing them. Many wealthy guests support the scene. The sound of trapping sparrows fills the bamboo forest. When the party breaks up, each eats congee. Liu escorts guests, ready to share intimate feelings. Several hotels are enjoying booming business. All rely on the warmth to dispel the cold, using heaters. Even more, the Jai Alai grounds are doing well. Sons and nobles come to bet on wins and losses. Even more, people compete to watch dog racing at Yiyuan. Electric hares fly as dogs chase behind. Dancing prevails in greater Shanghai. Lightly whirling, a paired dance is joyful and resonant. They urge the opening of champagne to kiss each other. Several young people are about to lose their souls. Whispers arrange meetings, emotions seething. To know the value of a spring night is worth a thousand gold. Taking a car home, it's already dawn.</p>

<h3>(New Type People) The Reasons Why It's Difficult to Get on Camera (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>The combination of features forms a chimera-like face.</p>
<p>Preconceived notions and audience habits are influenced and shaped.</p>
<p>There is also a very strange thing, which deserves our deeper thought, that is, the easy success of new young actors, from the perspective of (popularity), not necessarily in terms of remuneration, are those few who resemble successful predecessors in appearance. Looking back at the past of the film industry, those who have enjoyed the greatest success and have been supported in the film industry for the longest time, we should first mention Gloria Swanson (GLORIA SWANSON). She voluntarily left the film industry because she wanted to be independent, to be romantic, but if she had not left the film industry, she could still be a dazzling star today. After Swanson left the screen, we had Fay Wray (FAY WRAY). We can say with certainty that Fay's face resembled Swanson's, which at least helped her get an excellent opportunity. When Fay placed her new type of face before film tycoons and audiences, the fact that her face was similar to that of a brilliant film queen was not only harmless to her, but instead helped her success. Perhaps Fay herself did not realize this, but if she examined herself, she would certainly admit that it was an undeniable fact. Of course, after Fay entered the film world, she had to establish her true value, otherwise she would not be able to stand for long in this quicksand-like film world. But Swanson's appearance had already given the audience a pre-emptive statement on her behalf.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when you see Katharine Hepburn (KATHERINE HEPBURN), don't you think of Ms. Garbo (GRETA GARBO)? Wasn't she initially called the American Garbo by the public? If Hepburn is very happy today, and you tell her that her face is very similar to that of the Swedish girl, thus helping her success, she will definitely nod in agreement. But when she is not happy, you mention this, she will get angry and shout: (Who is Garbo? I don't know? Because her wildcat-like temper is like that.</p>
<p>That was still in the silent film era, when Fox was preparing to shoot (Seventh Heaven), nine out of ten general staff members shook their heads when they saw Janet Gaynor (JANET GAYNOR). They didn't know who this new type of girl was, and (Seventh Heaven) was a film with great promise. They suspected that the tycoons in the company were out of their minds, and easily let this unfamiliar person play this important role. They didn't know that the tycoons' vision was very far-reaching. They were sure that Janet Gaynor was a pocket-sized version of Lois Wilson (LOIS WILSON). At that time, Lois Wilson's innocence and naivety represented a pure and flawless woman, which had already been deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience.</p>
<p>Jeanne Eagels' (JEANNE EAGELS) story is very tragic. Her invasion of sound films was because the stage wanted to punish her at that time, and temporarily did not give her work. She brushed her sleeves and went to Hollywood. She starred in a THE LETTER and unexpectedly became famous in one fell swoop. Her unique face and radiant hair felt even more glorious when they appeared on the screen. But it is a pity that she was unable to enjoy her success for a long time, but unconsciously created a ready-made base for Marlene Dietrich (MARLENE DIETRICH). Marlene Dietrich and Jeanne Eagels can be regarded as a pair of sisters. This is not to say that Marlene was hired to come to the United States entirely because she looked like Jeanne Eagels, but we can say that her resemblance to Jeanne Eagels is one of the reasons why we liked her as soon as we saw her.</p>
<p>As for Julie Haydon (JULIE HAYDON), because she looked very much like Ann Harding (ANN HARDING), she played Ann Harding's daughter in the play, thus obtaining an important position, which is especially a fact that everyone knows. At first, the company didn't want Julie to leave any deep traces on Her Private Affair, but afterwards, from the fans' letters, it could be seen that she had already used this step to rise through the ranks, and unexpectedly won a long-term contract with RKO.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel that the new type of beauties, those who can last on the screen, are still those who wear old masks, those masks that we are already used to seeing. Camera is particularly generous to these types of faces, because these types of faces reflect something incredible, and that incredible thing can only be called illusion (ILLUSION). The correctness of the face, which is what we usually call beauty, rarely makes it onto the camera.</p>
<p>However, whether it is a new type of face, or the old faces that we are used to seeing, they can never be imitated. Specializing in imitating appearances, but lacking substantial content, will be counterproductive. Those who succeed because their faces resemble famous big stars do not rely solely on the similarity of their faces to someone or someone. They must break away from similarities and strive for their own independence and uniqueness. Their resemblance to Swanson, to Garbo, to whoever, to whoever, are all tricks of the camera. But if they don't have their own substantive skills, even if the camera once praised them, they will not be able to maintain their position permanently. (End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of (Transatlantic)</h3>
<p>— Quan Han</p>
<p>Transatlantic</p>
<p>Merry_Go_Round—Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>Hollywood films, from (1934) onwards, have put on the colorful clothes of song and dance for the usually serious detective films. The development of this trend is undoubtedly based on the popularity of light and lively films.</p>
<p>However, no matter what the form, detective films cannot adopt new content, and will ultimately not be able to save the decline of detective films. That kind of unprincipled description of so-called love disputes between men and women will ultimately not interest people who demand the expression of reality. There is no real content here, only love disputes and pirate elements. Speaking of this, this may conflict with Hollywood's cleanliness movement, and films that are sexually suggestive or promote theft are classified as being cleared by gentlemen. However, from a new perspective, as long as the author originally produced it to expose reality, and its effect is not to obtain the opposite effect of being sexually suggestive or promoting theft, then taking sex and theft as the subject matter is definitely not moral depravity. On the contrary, in the sense of expressing reality, it will have its great success. However, this requirement is not easily accepted by American film writers.</p>
<p>What is expressed in (Transatlantic)? How does the director express it? Here are gorgeous songs and dances, enchanting love songs, and flirtations. Gambling and clever tricks of stealing, these all make people seeking entertainment feel some interest.</p>
<p>In addition, we can't find anything particularly worth learning in this film. It's good to give the audience happiness and joy in this new year.</p>
<h3>There are Three Kinds of National Flags in (Eternal Love)</h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>I don't know where this news came from, saying that Fei Mu left Lianhua to join another company. Although this matter has not been confirmed for many days, there are still outsiders who are skeptical. Therefore, those who care about Lianhua and love Fei Mu have recently sent letters asking about this matter. From this point of view, Fei Mu is indeed of great importance in Lianhua, and it can also be said in the Chinese film industry. However, rumors are rumors, and facts are facts. The fact is that (Eternal Love), which he co-directed with Luo Mingyou, has indeed started filming. Here is also a great thing to report to everyone, that there are three kinds of national flags in (Eternal Love). Everyone thinks, a film uses three kinds of national flags, you say is it great enough? At this time, Fei Mu, seeing this manuscript being written by the side, couldn't help but smile and say: (It's a pity that there are only three kinds of national flags here, if there were all the flags of the world, it would be even greater!) Those who heard it praised Lao Fei for his humor.</p>
<h3>New Star Films in 1935</h3>
<p>— Huo</p>
<p>In 1935, the new films that the Star Company is eager to release or are in production include the following:</p>
<p>(Orchid in the Valley) is directed by Zhang Shichuan, and stars Hu Die and Gao Zhanfei. This film was originally Star's silent film, and its content is as (full of twists and turns) and (sad and stubborn) as possible. This time it has been changed to a sound film, so of course this silent film is even more spectacular.</p>
<p>(Falling Flowers Season) is Wu Cun's second masterpiece after Remarriage. The theme depicts a group of volunteers and a young girl who wandered to Shanghai and ate up the pain of life. From (Falling Flowers Season) to (Heavy Snow), the winter is used to express a very sad mood. The picture is as beautiful as a poem, overflowing with the spirit of (joy) and (sorrow).</p>
<p>(Human Relations) is directed by Li Pingqian, and stars Gong Jianong, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and Zhu Qiuhen. It depicts the tragic experience of a young man growing old, how he becomes unemployed, how his wife and children are scattered, and how he is unfortunately imprisoned. This is a film similar to Paul Muni's (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang).</p>
<p>(Tuberose) (Boat Girl) (Night Meeting) are all sound films. The three all depict the darkness, sin, economic collapse, and rural bankruptcy of the city. In this stormy era, films of this kind undoubtedly have important significance. The directors are Cheng Bugao, Shen Xiling, and Yao Sufeng.</p>
<p>There are also (Beauty's Heart), which was filmed a year ago, and the temporarily shelved Nostalgia. (Rebirth Flower) (24 Hours in Shanghai) etc. are being screened in the New Light and Central Theaters. (But)</p>
<h3>Moving Towards (The Big Road) in 1935</h3>
<p>— Songhua</p>
<p>The first thing that Xingguo people came into contact with on New Year's Day in 1935 was the Lianhua Film Company's (The Big Road), which was being screened at Jincheng. Perhaps this is a symbol of the new China moving towards (The Big Road)? Let us wish it in advance!</p>
<p>(The Big Road) is Lianhua Company's all-out production. In terms of its significance, director, and actors, it really has a value that surpasses everything. Therefore, during the production period, (The Big Road) had already established solid expectations and faith in society. And the (The Big Road) that has now been built will of course live up to the expectations of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>In terms of significance, (The Big Road) truly expresses the greatness of the Chinese people's united strength. In China, where imperialism and local bullies collude to oppress each other, the method of self-rescue depends only on its own unity and efforts. There is no doubt that in the film, the local bullies used various methods to destroy the people's front, but due to the consolidation of the people's internal affairs, they finally failed. This, on the one hand, exposes the ugliness of the collusion between imperialism and evil forces, and on the other hand, shows that the people's power cannot be insulted. The seriousness of its significance and the reality of its subject matter are undoubtedly the films that China urgently needs today.</p>
<p>The director of this film is Sun Yu, who revived national films. Based on his past contributions to the Chinese film scene, we can of course trust him. The actors are led by Jin Yan, and twelve stars including Chen Yan Yan, Li Lili, Zhang Yi, and Luo Ming are gathered to co-star. Lianhua's male stars have all been gathered in this film. The performance is both tragic and humorous, and grabs the audience's emotions everywhere. The plot is strong and unprecedented. It is indeed a film worthy of movie fans' attention.</p>

<h3>Police Romance (White Lies) (2)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Qiong was taking a bath in the tub. While splashing water, she was wondering how to meet this Tyler Camden. She was picturing in her mind what kind of person this bold policeman was. Was he tall? Was his complexion dark? Was he thin? Was his hair red? Did his eyes smile before he spoke? She clearly knew that she was engaged to Axel Brantley. She was even going out with him tonight. But she couldn't make up her mind whether her heart would change once she met this Tyler.</p>
<p>At this moment, Mitchell was sitting in his study, excitedly reading a news proof, having completely forgotten everything from before. Because the news he had in his hand now was a sensational piece, exclusive to his Express. That news was extremely convoluted and moving, capable of bringing tears to one's eyes. It turned out that a senior bank employee, named Dan Oliver, had embezzled 30,000 yuan from the bank several years ago. But after embezzling it, he deeply regretted it and wanted to gradually repay it. He had already put back most of it, leaving only about 10,000 yuan, but his actions had been discovered. A reporter for the Express, named Roberts, was the first to know about this. But he had promised Oliver not to disclose the news, because Oliver pleaded bitterly, giving him a chance to reform, and he was already deeply repentant. Roberts was a soft-hearted person and readily agreed to keep the secret for him. However, Mitchell refused. He said that was not how he cultivated his newspaper. He said he only had one policy: to get news, get it fast, get it right! He didn't care about anything else! Whoever runs into it, whoever is unlucky, as long as there is no room for them to sue him! Take this Dan Oliver, for example. He did something wrong and committed a crime. Those are all facts. Therefore, he, Mitchell, could loudly announce his criminal past, word for word, in his newspaper. In this way, everyone would rush to buy the Express to read. That was a legitimate way to promote newspaper sales. As for Dan Oliver, he was just a legitimate unlucky guy, who deserved to be used by him.</p>
<p>The next morning, when he took his big car to his newspaper office, he felt happy thinking about his upcoming victory. He seemed to already hear the printing press in the machine room, rotating with a rumbling sound. He also seemed to hear the newsboys on the streets, raising their voices to call out. He also seemed to hear the noisy discussions on the streets about this shocking case, and he also seemed to hear everyone praising how well-informed the Express was, a place that other newspapers could not reach. When his car entered the bustling city and drove through the noisy crowd, he thought of his daughter again, wondering what she was doing now. Perhaps she was having her sweet spring dream, this little devil. He couldn't help but chuckle. His daughter and a police officer. If she hadn't pleaded for him, that policeman would probably be wandering the streets now.</p>
<p>Soon he arrived at the Express's newspaper office. The staff were bustling about, extremely busy. The sound of typewriters, the sound of telephone bells, the sound of conversations, and the sound of the printing presses in the basement, all mixed together, created a scene of a thriving newspaper business. Mitchell nodded to everyone as he walked along. He walked into his private office. He briefly reviewed the routine matters and ordered the local news editor to be invited. Soon the local news editor arrived, and he instructed: (Move everything else away and put this Dan Oliver case on the front page. There are still many changes to be made in these proofs. First, the line of text below the copperplate should be changed to (Dan Oliver, senior bank employee, arrested for embezzlement). The rest, I have written, you can read it yourself.) The chief editor agreed repeatedly and walked out. Mitchell was still shouting from behind: (Hurry up! My newspaper will be on the streets in thirty minutes!) (To be continued)</p>
