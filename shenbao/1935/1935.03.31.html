<p>中國酒精廠開幕</p>
<h3>籌辦中國酒精廠之意義</h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>中國酒精廠是實業部與華僑黃宗孝黃江泉兩先生合作籌辦的結果。從發動到現在已有兩年，而實際籌辦却不滿一年，試機出貨實還在三個膾以前。今天不過籍邀集各界到時廠參加的機會，舉行一簡單的開幕儀式，紀念中國一個新工業的肇端。</p>
<p>一個國家的立國，必有牠的根本條件和問題。所謂根本條件和問題，即是最低限度的自給和比較近代的防範。二者缺一，不足立國。最低限度的自給，除食料衣料而外，燃料實是很重要的一個元素。燃料之於實業及交通，是動力之源，生產之母。只要燃料的供給，斷絕一分鈍，整個社會的生產機能，交通工具，勢將完全停滯。而現代國防工具之有賴於燃料，更比實業及交通來得切要，現代戰爭所必爭之海軍根據地空軍根據地，無非是要得燃料給濟之保證。自從內燃機發明以後，液體燃料的應用，實有駕固體燃料而上之勢。無論交通用具，原動力機，軍用器具，應用液體燃料的增加，很是使人注意。福煦將軍所說：「一滴汽油一滴血」，非但在戰塲上如此，在一國實業的發展亦如此，在我們感覺到液體燃料，於一國立國條件之重要，愈使我們對於中國自給問題的驚駭。</p>
<p>中國幾年來公路交通的發達，航空事業之進展，是極顯著的。而汽車飛機所用的燃料，大都仰給於輸入，最近五年來，汽油的輸入，從一〇九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公升（民國十八年）增至一一七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公升，（民國二十二年）煤油的輸入更大，民國十八年輸入量是九〇六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公升，一一十二年也在七〇八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公升，每年輇入汽油之價值，平均在一千萬海關兩，煤油之價值，平均在五千五百萬海關兩左右。從這種巨量的液體燃料的輸入，可見公路交通和航空事業進展的趨勢，同時也可見液體迫切需要的程度，中國汽油不能自給，要應迫切的需要，惟有我汽油的替代品。我們看到歐洲汽油不能自給的各國，如德國，法國，意大利，瑞典，奧國，匈加利，捷克，及巨哥斯拉夫等，都拿酒精來作汽油的一部份替代品，并且各有强制使用酒精汽油混合品之立法，給我們考慮這問題很好的參考材料，同時增加我們推進酒精工業的勇氣和期望，這是我們與黃君稅等籌備合作創辦中國酒精廠主要動機之一。</p>
<p>在工業發達的國家，酒精是精是糖廠的副產，在中國製糖工業沒有發達以前，酒精所用原料，只能用其他澱粉質物品。據實業部中央工業所研究的結果，甘薯梁，俱適於酒精製造，而且很經濟。這兩種農產，并不是主要的食糧，原來價值很低，任何土地都可種植的。利用這兩種農產來做酒精工業的原料，於農業上有一個很有利的作用，一方面能增加農產品的價值，同時可以利用荒地廣種此兩種原料，籌辦中國酒精廠的動機，這是第二點。</p>
<p>中國酒精廠是經實業部呈准中央在江蘇浙江福建三省地域內取得專製權的。這專製權之准許，獎勵新興工業外，更大的意義是在統帛。新興工業的發展，每有投機性的勃發，大家看見新興工業有利可圖，不管生產的供求情形，都爭先恐後的設立同樣工廠，結果不是供過於求，卽是截喉競爭，終於兩敗俱傷。在中國工業發達史上，這種實例，眞不知多少，酒精製造是新興工業之一，於國防，燃料，都有關係，决不能任其再蹈以前投機性的勃發與衰落的週波。并且要施行統制經濟，必先從新工業方面試行。因此中央給予中國酒精廠在一定的區域，一定的年限內，有專製的特權，希望在適應供求的情形下，使酒精製造工業，造成堅固的基礎。我們相信現有的其他酒精廠，决不會受到不利的影響，若是彼此能於生產上營業上有相當協調和合作，整個酒精工業，才能在有計劃的方式下進展。施行統制，這是合作籌辦中國酒精廠的第三個重要意義。</p>
<p>實業部對於工業方面的任務，是在促進重要工業的建設。政府可以由國庫撥欵舉辦非國營不可的各種工業，而同時應鼓勵人民照政府預定之計劃，共負工業建設之資任，酒精工廠本是政府工業計劃之一種，國庫旣不充俗，與商民合作舉辦，實是最自然的一條送徑，在議擬合作辦法的過程中，我們時時感覺到僑商建國的熱比，與政府誠意相見的表示，這是我們深感愉快與安慰的。</p>
<p>中國酒精廠在充實國防，燃料白給，利用農產，及統制生產的重要意義下開幕，也可以指示出中國工業發展之線路與方向。我們祝賀中國酒精廠之成功，同時將此意義告諸社會。</p>
<h3>中國酒精製造公司開慕紀念取精用宏</h3>
<p>— 林森</p>
<h3>利弘自給</h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘</p>
<h3>中國酒精廠廠屋全景</h3>
<h3>弁言</h3>
<p>— 劉維熾</p>
<p>我國工業落後，凡百事業胥不如人；近歳以來，邦人君子共知急起直追之為必要，政府則力盡提倡指導之責，期與人民密切合作，於是一切生産事業始克觕具端倪，酒精廠蓋其一也。</p>
<p>酒精之用途，所以適應科學方面之重大需要，固已盡人知之。前此國内雖有小規模之製造廠，顧以資本未充，設備難臻完善，發展之望，殊未易言，遂致工業及醫藥上所需，不得不取給於外貨。其在今日，吾人積極經營以謀挽回垂失之利權者，誠未可再事緩圖已。</p>
<p>華僑黄君江泉有鍳於此，爰為剏設官商合辦中國酒精製造股份有限公司之建議。黄君向在南洋，以經營實業有聲於時，對於祖國之生産事業，尤抱從事發展之熱誠，其力復足以舉此鉅大之製造工業；政府既知其然，於是與之合作，籌維締構，歷時匝歳，工廠始告成立。嗣兹酒精岀品，庶可廣應需要，補救漏巵，裨益所及，豈淺尠哉！</p>
<p>兹當公司開幕之始，特志數言，以為紀念。</p>
<h3>籌備經過及設備概況</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>酒精為工業上之重要原料，亦為工業上之重要溶劑。舉凡醫學，化學，化妝品，肥料，油漆，人造絲，人造象牙，無煙火藥等等，莫不需用大宗酒精：他如供燃料，防腐劑及配合飲料之用者，為量亦多。近年我國工業逐漸發達，酒精需要，亦與時俱進。惟年來此項酒精，大都輸自外國，漏巵至鉅；匪特利權外溢，且以國防及日用所需，仰頼舶來，亦殊失自給自存之道也。</p>
<p>矧現在世界各國，為求竭力搏節汽油，俱相繼實行强制人民，以酒精加入汽油代替一部分之燃料。近年歐洲各國，曾先後制定强迫混用酒精與汽油之法律，，以規定油商應購進酒精之數量，及混合酒精應有之成分。即以石油天富著稱之美國，亦已有應用農產酒精為液體燃料之議。由此尤足見近年來酒精在液體燃料中地位之重要。我國石油儲量不豐，加以尚未開採，欲謀液體燃料之自給，酒精與汽油混合施用，亦屬要圖。是以酒精工廠之創設，在我國實屬急不容緩。</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>實業部鑒於酒精工業之重要，早將其列為實業部應行興辦基本工業之一。徒以限於財力，復鑒於製造酒精之原料及技術問題，有預先解决之必要，爰一面籌劃設廠，一面從事研究及試騐。故實業部中央工業試騐所內購置製造酒精設備，對於製造酒精之原料及技術等問題，詳細研究。並訓練下級技術人才，以為創設酒精廠之準備。經該所對於以澱粉原　：如高梁，甘薯，玉蜀黍等製造酒精，關於原料之選　，蒸煮之程度，糖化劑之良否，糖化劑用量之多寡，糖化之時間以及糖化能否完個等問題，予以長時間之研究及試騐，結果至為圓滿。</p>
<p>實業部為促進國防工業之發展及鼓勵革僑回國投資起見，因與僑商黃江泉等洽商先從發展酒精工業入手，候有成效再及其他，於是擬具計劃由官商合資設廠。繼經一再磋商，對於資本，產額，官股，數目等問題，均得圓滿解决，遂由雙方擬定合同草案，由實業部提出行政院會議修改通過，轉送中政會議議决修正通過。並於二十二年十月間，雙方簽訂正式合同</p>
<p>該廠資本，依照合同規定，原為一百萬元，官股十分之一，由商方借發；惟嗣後雙方為收最大功效起見，恐原定資本不敷，特增加總額至一百五十萬元，數額分配則仍照合同規定</p>
<p>自合同簽訂之後，即開始積極進行。當在上海浦東白蓮涇購地百五十畝為該廠廠址。於二十三年五月開始建築廠屋。十一月中旬機械安裝冠竣，開始試車。十二月一日着手製造。十二月十五開始蒸溜，酒精成分為百分之九六至九七，品質極為醇良，每日產量約三萬公升，（約合七千英加倫）。</p>
<p>概況</p>
<p>關於該廠之　屋建築，內部組織情形，惟及各種重要機器設備等。約可分項略述如下：</p>
<p>甲，廠屋建築　該廠廠基，佔地四十畝。全廠概用鋼筋混凝土及負樑所建，屋高九下尺，四面玻窗，屋頂為平式，外觀極為宏偉。每種機械之旁，必建一空屋，以備擴充之用。故將來產量增加一倍。無須另建房屋。即一切機械，亦可在本國製造，所需資全較少。</p>
<p>乙，工廠組織　該廠由建源公司總經理黃江泉負責主持關於一切重要行政及出品推銷事宜。工廠方面，設化學，機械，及事務三處，由廠長指揮。化學設總化學工程師一人，助理化學師，管理員及練習生若干人，機械處練機械工程師一人，助理機械工程師及管理員若干人。事務處設中西文秘書及辦事員若干人。廠長，總機械工程師，總化學工程師，俱係聘請留美德荷各工業專家担任，對辦理工廠，均富有實地之經騐。</p>
<p>該廠製造及分析方面，除聘富有經騐之人員分別主持外，所有各部工作人員，均係中等學校以上之畢業生，並經過長時間及適當之訓練，故工作效率，較一般工廠為高。</p>
<p>丙，職員之待遇　該廠建有精美之職員眷屬住宅，供廠長，總化學師，總機械師，及其他重要職員居住之用。並建築廣大之宿舍，為職員練習生等之住所。關於各項運動塲游泳池等，亦正設計興築。俾工作人員於工作之餘，得到身心之休養。</p>
<p>丁，設備概要　可分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）機械之來源該廠機械，係向英國伯萊爾公司（Biairs　Ltd．）定購。此廠在格拉斯哥（Glasgow），為世界有名之化學機械工廠，對於蒸溜器之設計，尤負盛名。</p>
<p>（二）機械之種類該廠機械可以兼用穀類薯類及糖蜜為原料，其設備之完善卽在歐美各國，亦不多覯。茲將重要設備略述如下：</p>
<p>1.穀類原料處理室　該室備有除塵機，去殼機，篩殼機及磨碎機。一切運輸，概用袋式或螺旋式運輸機。</p>
<p>2.蒸煮糖化室　內備高壓蒸煮機，糖化機，及冷却機等。各機之設計，均極新穎，故工作效率極大。</p>
<p>3.發芽室　該廠使用麥芽為穀類及薯類原料糖化之用。麥芽製造室應用最新式之冷氣機，故天氣溫暖之時，亦可從事製造。且麥芽佔地面積亦校少。</p>
<p>4.冲淡室　此室係供糖蜜冲淡及殺菌之用。一切工作均具有繼續性。糖蜜之攪拌，係用濾過之壓縮空氣。室內附置純粹酵母培養器，可供穀類醪及糖蜜醪醗酵之用。</p>
<p>5.醱酵室　該廠備鐵製密閉醱酵槽十六個。每個容量七六五〇〇公升（一七〇〇〇英加侖）。內設汽管，水管，空氣管等。當醱酵時，發生之炭酸氣，由槽頂總管通入炭酸氣劇造室，以備製造乾冰（Dryice）及液體炭酸氣之用。</p>
<p>6.蒸溜室　該廠備有伯萊爾公司製造之述續式蒸溜精製及提净機。最初蒸出之酒精，含有低沸點之醛質（Aldehydes）。最後溜出之酒精，含有高沸點之雜醇油（Fusel　Oll），完全與製成品相分離。故成品之質，極為純良。</p>
<p>7.化驗室　該廠設有化騐空二間，專司製造部分之化學管理。又設培養空殺菌室各一間，專司酵母之培養，及其他研究工作。此外並設小規模之試騐工塲。每種原料，須經小規模試騐合格後，再行大規模之製造。該廠於研究工作，極為重視。所有一切　　儀器，莫不具備。</p>
<p>8.裝罐室　該廠建有火險之裝罐空二所。裝盛方法，概用自動管理。容量及重量，均經精確秤量後，方運入倉庫，以備出售。</p>
<p>該廠採用上等洋鐵皮製造一八公升（四英加侖）洋鐵罐。並用上等自鐵皮製造三六·四公升（八英加侖）及二〇〇·二公升（四十四英加侖）之白鐵罐。此類白鐵罐，不致生誘，故酒精無摻雜鐵銹之虞。</p>
<p>（三）蒸汽之供給該廠備有Babcock及Wilcox公司所製水管式鍋爐兩座。每座具熱面積三九〇〇平方尺。一切運輸，均用機械。</p>
<p>（四）電力之供給該廠備有A．E．G．400啓羅活特之發電機（每分鐘一五〇〇迥轉）一座，與每分鐘六〇〇〇迴轉透平（Turbine）直接相連，可供全廠電動機及電燈之用。透平之廢汽，通至蒸溜室，及其他各部，以供應用。故蒸汽之消耗，極為節省。</p>
<p>（五）原料之貯藏該廠兼用穀類，薯類，及糖蜜為原料。除穀類，薯類倉庫，正在設計建築外；糖蜜貯藏槽，己建二個。每個可容糖蜜六千噸，二槽共容一萬二千噸，足供四個月之製造。</p>
<p>（六）成品之貯藏該廠備有酒精貯藏槽二個，每個容量一百萬公升，二槽共容二百萬公升。設每日出品為三萬公升，卽可貯二個月所出之製品。</p>
<p>（七）水之供給該廠鏧有深七〇〇尺之水井一口，每小時可出水一三六五〇〇公升（三〇·〇〇〇加侖），由空氣壓榨機壓出後，再用遠心喞筒打入水塔，以供全廠之用。</p>
<p>（八）火息之防備該廠備有防火用打水　筒，卽由一百二十五匹馬力之汽油機（Sterling－petrel）牽動，此筒筒每分鐘打水四五五六公升（一〇〇〇英加侖），可將黃浦江之水通至全廠及住宅各部分，以防火患。</p>
<p>擴充計畫</p>
<p>該廠建有製造炭酸氣之廠房，以備將來安裝機件製造液體炭酸氣及乾冰之用。按液體炭酸氣，為製造汽水之重要原料；乾冰為最新發明之冷藏劑，較之人造冰，冷却力旣大，而應用又極便利，該廠將來產量每日約二〇公噸，可供全國酒精之消耗，其他如純粹酒精，醇精，及汽車燃灶等工廠，亦在積極籌備之中。</p>
<h3>功繼燧人　中國酒精製造股份有限公司開幕紀念</h3>
<p>— 孫科題</p>
<h3>熱誠的希望</h3>
<p>— 谷正綱</p>
<p>中國酒精工廠，自民國二十二年的冬間，實業部與僑商黃江泉先生簽訂官商合辦的合同以後。經年餘的積極籌備，現在已經完全成功了。這僩工廠的成立，我認為有兩點重大的意義：</p>
<p>第一，樹立國防工業的基礎；</p>
<p>第二，倡導華僑投資的先聲；</p>
<p>現在我先就第一點的意義來說：酒精為現代工業和國防最重要的原料，是一般人所共知的。無論醫醫藥，化學，及無煙火藥等等，都需要大宗的酒精。最近有許多國家發明以酒精與汽油油混用，或以酒精來代替汽油，更使酒精成為一種最重要的液體燃料。我國的工業，現巳漸漸的發達，我國的國防，現正積極的建設，對於酒精的需要，是一天此一天的迫切；需要酒精的數量，是一天比一天的增加。過去我國所需的酒精，皆賴舶來的供給，這不僅是利權外溢，並且也是國防的危機。今幸中國酒精工廠全告成功，每日平均產量在三·〇〇〇公升以上，足供我國蘇，浙，閩，魯，冀五省的需要。我們有了這個新興的工業，今後可以杜塞我國一部的漏巵，同時也可為我國的工業和國防樹立一個永久的基礎。</p>
<p>其次，再說第二點的意義罷。利用華僑的資本，來發展我國的實業，巳成一般提倡生產事業的人們普徧的主張，同時，我們海外的僑胞，近因感受各國經濟的不景氣，也有回國投資的要求。惟因歷年國家多故，華僑的資本，沒有得着切實的保障，以致上述的主張和要求，未能具體得以實現。所以，現在對於僑資問題，不是如何吸收，而是如何保障，如果保障的問題，得到相當的解决，則僑資的吸收，是不成問題的。這次，實業部對於中國酒精工廠，特許牠有江，浙，閩，魯，冀五省的專處權，這就是免除國內不合理的競爭，而予僑　以特別的保障。我相信，這個工廠的創設，必能作華僑投資的先導的。</p>
<p>過去，中國工業的失敗，無論牠是國營，私營，或是官商合辦，其失敗的原因，不是失敗於技術，即失敗於管理。今後中國酒精工廠的同人，對於技術與管理，都要予以特別的注意和努力，這是我對於中國酒精工廠的一種熱誠的希望。</p>

<h3>中國酒精工業之發達途徑</h3>
<p>— 陳騶聲</p>
<p>一種工業之發達可分三個時期，一試騐時期，二設廣時期，　充時期。因工廠之設立，并經相當時間之試騐，則原料之物品集，製造之方法，及設區之　仆，　難十分確定，試　成功之後，再行設廠製造。担任製造者，對於方法之改良及出品之川途，又須月求精進，方能談到擴充問題。如此順序而進，未有不奏大功者也。</p>
<p>實業部中央工業試騐所對酒精工業之試騐，業已多年，且有相當之成績。自該所提倡之後，各地酒精工廠雲湧而起，是巳由試騐時期而達到設廠時期矣。將來已設立之工廠，如何可以使共擴充，則有賴乎主其事者之努力。茲特乘中國　精　開幕之日，　列關於酒精工業之各種重要問題，與社會人士一商確　。</p>
<p>（一）原料問題</p>
<p>製造酒精之原料以含有澱粉，糖及其他炭水化物者為生要。茲分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）澱粉質原料</p>
<p>澱粉質原料，以甘薯及高梁為大宗。溫瑞靑島及平綏路一帶之甘薯，產量甚豐；惜以交通不便，故每遇豐收之時，或任其腐爛，或以充飼料。倘能就地設立大大模之乾燥工廠，利用人工乾燥法，烘成薯乾，作為製造酒精之原料，裨益農村，實非淺鮮。且各產區地價甚廉，倘能廣為收買，從事播種，亦為開闢利源之一道。惜乎吾國盜匪遍地，商人不敢深入，此議之實行，尚非其時，故目下只有委托商人隨時收買，而當地農民復以採購者多，提高價格，以致酒精製造成本，亦因之而高，難與外貨相抗街。為今之計，惟有勸告產區官民，開闢荒野，廣為播種，然後民食及製造兩者皆不受影響；而荒蕪之地，亦得以日漸開闢，誠為計之上者也。</p>
<p>至於高梁之產量，以東三省為最豐。自東北問題發生後，高梁之愉入內地者，大受牽制。高梁澱粉含量即較乾薯為低，而價格復較乾薯為高，故採用者，尚不甚普及也。</p>
<p>茲將乾薯及高梁之水分及炭水化物含量列下：</p>
<p>水</p>
<p>高梁二·九二——一三·六九％</p>
<p>乾薯八·三〇——一五·三九％</p>
<p>炭水化物</p>
<p>高粱六二·六八——六六·〇一％</p>
<p>乾薯六六·六〇——七一·五九％</p>
<p>各省所産之乾薯，沿用舊種，每畝產量及澱粉含量，均有改良之必要。倘能提倡新種，廣為宣傳，則農民獲利必將倍蓗，是則酒精工業與農業之改善，亦有相當之關係也。他如大麥可以製造麥芽，麩皮可以製麯，均為澱粉質製造酒精之次要原料。</p>
<p>（乙）含糖原料</p>
<p>含糖原料，以甘蔗，甜菜及糖蜜為最要。糖蜜為製糖工廠之副產物，用以製造酒精者，極為發達，美國則採用魯亦斯安那，古巴等地之甘蔗糖蜜，英國則應用爪哇等地之甘蔗糖蜜，德國則應用本國之甜菜糖蜜，日本則應用台灣之甘蔗糖蜜，其他各國莫不以糖蜜為主要原料。因糖蜜所製之酒精，與澱粉質原料所製成者，初無二致；而其來源，較為豐富，不若澱粉啠原料之與民食有關，有時發生供給問題也。甘蔗糖蜜及甜菜糖蜜之濃度均約八十八度勃立克司（880Brix）其普通含糖量如下：</p>
<p>甘蔗糖　轉化糖</p>
<p>甘蔗糖蜜　三三％　二二％</p>
<p>甜菜糖蜜　四六％</p>
<p>（丙）織維素含有原料</p>
<p>此項原料爲木材，泥炭，強維製造廠之廢物及製紙廠之亞硫酸廢液等。約在百年以前，Barconnot氏，發現濃硫酸可以溶解織維，而稀硫酸可以使強維變為醱酵性糖分以後。各國學者競相研究以織維含有物如木屑，泥炭等為製造酒精之原料。美國Goorgetown酒精工廠製造之結果，乾燥木材一百公斤，平均僅出酒精五·三四公升。卒因生產量太低之故，而陷於停　之　。將來是否能　微生物之力，使強維變為酒精，則有賴乎吾人之努力研究也。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，吾國製造酒精之原料，當以乾薯高梁及糖蜜為最主要。在乾薯高梁未能充分供給以前，不得不倣效英美等國之成規，以糖蜜為補助原料。本廠一切設備，均按此計劃，各種原料無不能用以製造酒精，故原料之供給，不至發生問題也。</p>
<p>（二）製造問題</p>
<p>酒精製造之範圍甚廣，非精於有機化學，生物化學及應用微生物學者，每不能澈底明瞭。原料之分析，及製造中途之檢騐，屬於分析化學。澱粉之糊化及糖化與麥芽之製造，屬於酵素化學。米麯麩麵之製造，酵母之純粹培養，屬於應用微生物學，酵母及徽菌之檢索，屬於純粹微生物學。酒精之蒸溜，屬於化學工程學。各種製造手續旣如是之繁難，故製造稍一不愼，生產量卽受莫大之影響。茲特舉其重要者，而略述之：</p>
<p>（甲）酵母之選擇</p>
<p>酵母之性質，依種類而不同，有適於澱粉質原料之醱酵者，有適於糖質原料之醱酵者，其重要之特性如下：</p>
<p>（1）能於三十六小時以內，將可醱酵物質完全變為酒精。</p>
<p>（2）可以抵抗高溫度溫至少攝氏四十度。</p>
<p>（3）可以抵抗高濃度之酒精—至少百分之十二。</p>
<p>（4）可以抵抗高酸度。</p>
<p>（5）絕對純粹，不含有害菌類。</p>
<p>吾國製酒之歷史極久，各地酒藥酒　之含有優良　母者，當不在　　。數業實中部工業試騐所對此工作，已有　　之研究，所獲亦復不少，其中可供大規模　　用者，亦有數種之多。</p>
<p>（乙）酵母之培養</p>
<p>大規模之製造，以如何可以使酵母不至受外來之污染，為最大之問題。澱粉質製造酒精，往昔多片乳醉　　法，使酵母醪中含有足量之乳酸，可以防止細菌之侵入，而酵母復能十分繁殖。現今各國，則用　氫酸以代乳酸，其效力亦甚偉大，惟酵母須經適當之馴養耳。至於糖蜜製造酒精，則以使用純粹培養器為最適當，如美國之Magne　Machine，可以長時間培養純粹之酵母，世界各國，多採用之。</p>
<p>（丙）澱粉之糊化及糖化</p>
<p>澱粉之糊化，則以用Henze式高壓蒸煮機為最普通；此機具有攪拌器者，効力尤大。澱粉之糖化方法，可分四種：</p>
<p>一·酸糖化法　此法須用較多量之酸，且製造蒸骨機之材料，亦須具抗酸之性，故採用者少。</p>
<p>二·用麥芽為糖化齊劑　此法以歐美各國為最普及。有地板式箱式及鼓式等法，地板式法，佔地較大，箱式及鼓式法，設備則較昂。麥芽糖化力甚大，用此為糖化劑者，酒精產量亦較高，故採用者甚廣。</p>
<p>三·為糖化劑此法以日本為最普及，其主要徽菌為Aspergillus　Oryzae，製造既極簡便，原料之價格亦低，故吾國酒精廠亦多倣用之也。</p>
<p>四·用微菌法此法卽所謂阿明露法（Amyle　Process）可以不用麥芽或麩麯為糖化劑，而用極少量之徽菌細胞，使多量之澱粉變為糖分。但此法僅可供玉蜀黍高梁之用，如用以供薯醪之糖化者，則有種種之困難也。</p>
<p>上述各法，大規模之製造，以麥芽為最適用，此本廠所以特設最新式之麥芽製造室也。</p>
<p>（丁）酵母</p>
<p>澱粉糖化之後，變為糊精及糖分，糖分可以直接酸酵，而糊精則須山酵素之作用，變為糖分後，方能酸酵。此殘餘之糊精，如不能完全醱酵，則損大至大，故酒精產量之多寡，旣視乎糖化之能否完全，復視乎酸酵之是否强盛，否則產額未有不低减者也，至於醱酵之時，酸度如何可以使其不至增高，尤宜注意。</p>
<p>（丙）蒸溜</p>
<p>酒精品質之良否，與蒸溜機之設計及蒸溜之操作，大有關係，要以能完全分離低沸點之醛質，及高沸點之雜醉油為最重要。本廠蒸溜備有三塔，醱酵醪先經蒸溜塔，提出酒精成分後，再經提淨塔，提出低沸點之不純物（如　質）。此組製之酒精液復入精溜塔，使酒精成分增高。同時並提去高沸點之不純物（如雜醇油）其構迭之堅固，及設計之優良，在東亞各國，尚屬僅見，故酒精品質，可駕舶來最優貨品而上也。</p>
<p>（三）工廠管理問題</p>
<p>酒精製造手續旣頗繁難，故原料之成分，及製造中途之變化，均應施行化學管理，以便改良。茲舉其重要者如下：</p>
<p>1·原料之成分：屬於澱粉質原料者，則應分析炭水化物如澱粉，糊精及　分；屬於　質原料者，則應分析蔗糖，轉化糖及　等</p>
<p>2·糖化配之成分，如澱粉糊精及葡萄糖等。</p>
<p>3·糖蜜醪之成分，如蔗糖，轉化糖及氮等。</p>
<p>4·酵母醪及醱酵醪之糖分，酸度，PH值，溫度，酒精含量及顯微鏡之檢查等，每一二小時即須施行一次，以觀其醱酵進行之現象。</p>
<p>5·成品之分析，如酒精成分，酸度，醛，雜醇油，木精等等。</p>
<p>按酒精製造，以獲得最高酸酵效率為目的。故應得之酒精數量，與實得之酒精數量，必須詳加比較。如醱酵效率太低者，製造方法必有缺點。或因酵母能力不强，或因酸度濃度及溫度調節，不得其宜，故須詳細考察各部分之分析成績，而加以改進。此等化學管理之重要，卽極小規模之工廠，亦須十分注意，否則管理者雖有豐富之經騐，亦將無所適從矣。</p>
<p>（四）酒精用途問題</p>
<p>酒精之用途，大別為燃料，工業原料及普通用品三大類。燃料則以發光，生熱，及動力為主要，中以動力之消耗量為最多。工業原料可分三種。（一）為製迭之成品，酒精仍是成品中之一部份，如油漆化妝品等是。（二）為製造時利用酒精，出品後酒精卽被除去，所以成品中並不遺留酒精之成分，如賽瑯珞，透明肥皂，照相膠片，人造絲，紡織之印染等是。（三）為酒精和以其他藥品，致生化學作元，而其結果是酒精之本質完全改變，如製造瞇，迷蒙精等是。普通用品則以配製消毒劑，防腐劑等為主要</p>
<p>吾國近來工業漸見發達，故酒精之用途亦漸廣大。如味精，肥皂，香精化妝品，賽璐路，油漆及配合飲料等等，莫不需多量之酒精。</p>
<p>邇來酒精工廠遍及山西，山東，直　，江蘇，湖南，福建，廣東，廣西等省，將來生產或有過剩之虞，是則酒精之用途問題，亟應加以研究，方能防患於萬一也。</p>
<p>按酒精之用途以充作動力燃料者為大宗，現今石油缺乏之國家，均已強制人民將汽油摻用酒精。吾國每年汽油進口達一一七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公升，如能摻用百分十之酒精，則酒精之消耗量，已達一一，七〇〇，〇〇〇公升之多。惟普通酒精，若與汽油相混，當寒冷之時，不能冠全混合，故以使用無水酒精為宜，按無水酒精之製造，以Hiag法，爚法，及石膏法為最著。普通酒精經此一度之精製後，成本必較高，而其價格將不能與汽油相競爭。歐美各國均感此種困難。近年各國政府相繼强制執行，冀汽淮之輸入可以减少，其苦心可以想見。倘吾政府亦能下此决心，實行以酒精摻和汽油，並規定最公平之價格，俾酒精工廠可獲微利，而汽油之輸入，亦可略為减少；俟此辦法略有成效後，再行設法完全以酒精製造動力燃料，則動力燃料問題庶有解决之一日也。</p>

<h3>酒精用作內燃機燃料之建議</h3>
<p>— 顧毓瑔</p>
<p>現今內燃機普遍的應用，液體燃料的需要一天增加一天，在有油鑛的國家，自然以汽油為內燃機之主要燃料。在缺乏油鑛的國家，大都仰給於輸入的汽油；若要求自給，則惟有我相當的替代品。主要的替代品不外兩種，一是笨查林Benzollne栢油之副產品了一是酒精。以酒精替代汽油，在歐洲各國民試用得較有成績，給我們研究這問題的不少參考。實業部與黃宗孝黃江泉兩先生合作產辦中國酒精廠的主要動機，鞏怕還在此。</p>
<p>我們先看各國以酒精替汽油的情形。</p>
<p>（甲）德國——德國之酒精，悉由政府專賣。農民製造酒精之原料，大都取諸番薯。糧　次之。工業製造酒精之原料，係利用紙廠中之廢液（Sulfite　Vatte　Liguor）。以番薯爲原料製成之酒精，佔總產量百分之七十。一九二〇年起，德國即實行酒行酒精與汽油混合應用，由政府統理。一九三二年十月起，政府限定汽汕商人必須國脈酒精至汽油消費量百分之十，規定無水酒精價值為每加侖一，九二馬克。（每加侖約合國幣二元一角）混合出售之汽油；至少須含有百分之二十，至冬至百分之三十之酒精。未經混合之汽油，因油商強近購入灑精後之負担增加，售價亦因之而提高。若油商欲將酒精讓不斷政府，則可按八五折計算，此項政策，即在鼓勵及提倡酒精工業。德國最近之趨勢，在於儘量利用國產之液體然料，由各項夜燃料混合而成為內燃機之燃料，進口之汽油，僅在該項混合然料中佔百分之三十五，德國求液體燃料之自給，其努力可見一班矣。（附錄第一表）</p>
<p>第一表　德國最近液體燃料之成份</p>
<p>無水酒精　百分之十</p>
<p>木精（山水煤氣綜合）　百分之十</p>
<p>崙（Bcnzoh）（由煉焦爐）　百分之十</p>
<p>人造汽油（油煤之加　）　百分之三十五</p>
<p>進口汽油　百分之三十九</p>
<p>（乙）法國——法國之酒精，亦由政府專賣。所有工業用酒精，係製自甜薯獲及糖獎。一九二三年起，法政府公佈定例，凡進口油商，必須同時購入酒精至百分之十之汽油進口量。供燃料用之酒精價格，每加侖訂定爲法郎九，二三（約合國幣一元七角）。一九三一年六月後，政府將規定之混合酒精成份，山百分之十增加至百分之二十五珒三十五，以百分二十五為最低限度。同時改訂無水水精售價至每加侖四，四三法郎。（僅合國幣八角一分，較前定數减去一半以上）。純粹汽油之售價，較混合汽油之售價，每加侖高出國幣一角二分，以資提倡，如是則每年作代替汽油之酒之精，可達三千九＋百萬加侖之多。法政府鑒於多酒精後，對於爲駛時有種種困難，故凡救火車救護車等，可不按規定成份加拉汽油，惟其力謀酒精應用之推廣，可以明矣。</p>
<p>（丙）意大利——意大利產有過剩之酒類，故利用一部份以製成酒精。政府規定酒精進口及生產數量百分之二十五，用以加入汽油。販賣汽油商人，必須購進規定數量之酒精。混合燃料之成份，為百分之二十之酒精與百分之八十之汽油。一九三二年，加入汽油之酒精，達二百六十萬加侖，每加侖售價降至五，五七里拉，遠在成本之下。政府當局尚在研究製造原料，增加國家之酒精產量。</p>
<p>（丁）瑞典——瑞典為世界產紙馳名之國，故該國之酒精原科，採用紙獎廢液，成本極廉。歐戰時，汽油原料斷絕，瑞典全恃酒精與木精為燃料機之燃料，以代汽油。現今瑞典所用汽油，須加入百分之二十至二十五之酒精，每年酒精消費，為七十萬加侖云。</p>
<p>（戊）奧國及匈牙利——奧國之酒精，係製自糖漿及番薯，悉由政府酒精管理局統制。混合汽油中之酒精成份為百分之二十五，每年消耗量約三十萬加侖。匈牙利爲酒精之出口國，鑒於酒精銷路滯緩；故自一九二九年起，卽強迫用迫於汽油中加進百分之二十之酒精，惟質地較輕之汽油（比重在〇七三五以下者）不在此例。自此頒條例布後，對於材經濟，裨益匪淺。</p>
<p>（已）捷克與還是哥斯拉夫——捷克平淡之消精，產自農村，大都取番薯類原料。一九三二年起，政府强迫汽油中必須混合百分之二十至二十五之酒精。是項命令執行後；每年酒精銷量，達一千五百六十萬加侖之多。巨哥斯拉夫國，亦於一九三二年起，採用強迫酒精與汽油混合應用，作為燃料。凡出售之汽油，必須含亦百分之二十之酒精，惟用於飛機中汽油，不在此例，每年作代替用汽油之酒精，達一百八十萬加侖之數。</p>
<p>其他歐洲各國，如西班牙波蘭等國，以及南美洲之阿根廷及古巴，均有同樣或類似之辦法，無不以利用酒精或代替汽油為目標。</p>
<p>關於酒精與汽油混合使用後於汽車之影響，此地可提出幾個重要問題以供參考。</p>
<p>若欲得同量之同力，完全用酒精時，其消費量高於汽油百分之五十，即一加侖半酒精之能力，僅及一加侖汽油之能力。若於汽油中滲以百分之十酒精時，則其消費量高於汽油百分之四至五。若於汽油中滲以百分之五之酒精，則其消費量高於汽油百分之一至二。駕駛時若欲得與用純粹汽油有同樣之加速與動作，則應將汽車機器中之混合器（Carburetor）略加改造，使混合氣體濃度增加，燃料消費亦因之增加。</p>
<p>酒精有極高之「屋格登數」，（Octane　Number）因使汽油減低「擊衝」，（Knocking）駕駛時較為順利，此共優點。含有百分之十酒精之汽油，能使此數增加七字。</p>
<p>根據公路上駕駛汽車之試騐，若用含有酒精百分之十之汽油，駕駛時之起動（Starting）與加速（Acceleration）並無若何影響。惟若加以百分之二十以上之酒精，則駕駛時有種種困難，如不易起動，動後不易加速，以及Vaoor　Lock等病。</p>
<p>總之，酒精加入汽油，若其濃度在百分之十左右，則駕駛時並無若何困難，普通全用汽油之汽車，卽可易用此項混合汽油，然料消費亦僅高出百分之五耳。</p>
<p>酒精汽油混合而成內燃機之適當燃料已無欵問，惟此項混合燃料遇有水份滲入，則易分離，分離後則酒精與水成另一混合體，應用時將有種種困難。蓋在任何溫度下，用任何比例，純粹無水酒精（Anbydrous　Ethyl　Alcohol）與汽油能冠全混合。若酒精內含有少量之水，有如下表：</p>
<p>第一表　汽油與酒精之分離溫度</p>
<p>（含有十分之一酒精之汽油）</p>
<p>觀第一表可明凡含有十分之一酒精之汽油，若混入千分之二至三之水，於冬日即有酒精與汽汕離分之可能。是以加入汽油之酒精，必使不含水份，普通之純粹酒精，常含有少量水分，故於混合前，必須設法除去云。</p>
<p>欲使汽油酒精之混合體絕對不含水分，於混合時可用無水酒精，惟待混合後貯藏時，往往有進量水份由外間滲貯入貯藏器內，或由空氣中之水氣混進，在固定之溫度下，汽油含酒精，成份愈多，可含水份愈多，而不致使與酒精分離。</p>
<p>尙有附表接第四版</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>此表緊接第三版</p>
<p>第二表　汽油與酒精含水成分離程度</p>
<p>（在華氏二〇度時）</p>
<p>汽油與酒精體混合，旣不能於貯藏時絕對不使外界之水份滲入，故治標之法，惟有加入一種混合劑（Blending　Ageut）雖使水份滲入後，汽油與酒精分離之溫度降至極低度，如華氏零度，則雖至冬日，可無分離之危險。此項混含劑可分兩類：（一）芳香氫炭屬如（Benzene，Toluene）等等，（二）高級酒精如（Butyl　Alcohol）。至混合劑之若何應用與其應用之數量尚待研究。</p>
<p>實業部中央工業試騐所於酒精汽油混合使用，巳於一年前着手試騐，（試騐報告載在該所出版之工業中心，）現在正擬作一長距離行駛之試騐，以研究其行駛時之困難問題。體燃料自給之道。這樣，中國酒精廠之設立不但於工業上開一新途徑，且於國防上亦負有重大的使命。今天祝中國酒精工廠之成功，並將這意見建議於社會。</p>
<h3>酒精工業之重要及中國酒精廠之使命</h3>
<p>— 劉蔭茀</p>
<p>酒精在工業與國防上，俱為重要原料，舉凡研究化學製造，醫藥，化妝品，油漆，人造絲，無烟火藥，以及配合飲料等等，莫不需要大量酒精，我國工業，漸見發達，酒精之需要日增，在民國十年以前，酒精輸入，尚不及四百五十萬公升，民國十年以後，遂由四百五十萬公升，增至九百萬公升以至一千七八百萬公升，民十八曾增至二千三百餘萬公升，近數年來，仍在九百萬至一千四百萬公升之間，以工業及國防之需要品，而悉仰給於人，豈特利權外溢，亦殊非自給自存之道。</p>
<p>近年世界各國趨向自給政策，在缺乏油鑛之各國，皆努力於汽油替代品之研究，而酒精已成公認之適當替代品，於是酒精在液體燃料中，復增加其重要性，考近年歐洲各國，俱已先後制定强迫混用酒精與汽油之法律，規定油商應購進酒精之數量及混合酒精應有之成分，即以石油天富著稱之美國，亦已有應用農產酒精為液料燃料之議，我國油鑛缺乏，且尚未着手開採，而內燃機各汽車飛機，均需用大量燃料，現在多仰給舶來，故近三年中，每年汽油輸入數量俱達七千餘萬至一萬一千餘萬公升，漏巵之鉅，實足驚人。在我國欲求液體燃料之自給，自非倣服歐美各國辦法，提倡酒精與汽油混合施用不為功，惟若實行此項政策，則酒精之需要量，即將隨其加入汽油之成分而驟增，如假定我國每年汽油之消費量爲一萬一千餘萬公升，而加入汽油之酒精成分為百分之十至百分之三十，則每年酒精之消費量，將較歷年增加一千一百萬公升至三千三百萬公升。換言之，換主之，我國現在酒精之消費量，如以一千三百五十萬公升計算，則實行酒精與汽油混合施用後，勢將　　消費量，增加一倍至三倍，是我國酒精工業，將來非有充分之發展大量之製造，不足　　　求。</p>
<p>查製造酒精之原料，在我國產量極豐，農產物一類如高粱，玉蜀黍，甘薯等隨地皆有有。甘薯遍於各省，高糧產於北方，據主計處統計局之報告，我國甘薯與高梁之產量，每年各在二萬萬担以上，如以每畝計，什薯之產量尤豐，計高梁每畝可產一担半，廿薯每畝可產十担，且售價低廉，均宜於製造酒精之用，是故我國如儘量設廠製造酒精，在原料上可無缺乏之虞，而農産物反可得一岀路，如將來我國製糖工業，再能發達，則利用糖廠副産品以製造酒精，則酒精工業之發展，尤屬意料中事。</p>
<p>中國各省之酒精工業，皆規模甚小，產量極徵，合廣東廣西建可北湖南湖北貴州之新式舊式之廠塲，其產額不過八十萬公升，而製法大都陳舊，成分較低，欲以供工業及燃料上所用，勢所難能。</p>
<p>實業部監於國內酒精需要之迫切，早曾籌謀設廠是，對於製造酒精之原料及技術各問題，俱經詳細研究，并曾於中央工業試騐所內，設立小規模之酒精工廠，以高粱甘薯等澱粉原料，實地試製酒精，以為設廠之張本，惟以限於財力，未能立即實現，上年僑胞黃宗孝黃江泉兩先生，抱振與實業之熱忱，有志回國投資，剏辦灑精工廠，　與合作，籌備年餘，幸得觀成，預計產量每日平均可得三〇·〇〇〇公升，此後當擬儘量　充，以求增加產量，是此廠之剏設，差可杜塞我國一部分之漏卮。惟國內各種工業方興未　，酒精之需求，與日俱增，欲國產酒精達到自給之上的，斷非一二大規模之工廠所能爲力，所望國內熱心實業人士，共起提倡利用本國極豐富之原料料，繼續設廠，庶幾我國酒精工業，得以充分發展，國計民生，其有豸乎。</p>

<h3>我的回憶</h3>
<p>— 施瑞山</p>
<p>記得八個月以前，我們中國酒精廠的廠址—浦東白蓮涇一號—還是一片荒蕪之地；在一百五十畝的地面內，唯有的點綴，不過是幾株矮小的柳樹，同一幢陳舊不堪的樓房。當我們初到消東來看察和測量的時候，感覺着十分的寂寞；空曠地，靜靜地，惟有那小烏的吱喳，和田蛙的狂　，驚擾了一片萬籟俱靜底一塊荒土！</p>
<p>無疑的這特刊裹的許多照片，和那些燦爛的貯藏種，水品式的廠屋，聳入雲際的水塔，深有七百尺的自流井，都是我們八個月以前的夢想，僥倖得很，我們的夢想，現在竟能實現於我們的眼廉之前了。</p>
<p>至於本廠的位置，我們曾經費了很多時間的攷慮着這一點，為了便利將來擴充起見，廠房决定在老公茂碼頭的旁邊，那水塔，那發動機室便圍繞着廠房了。</p>
<p>關於工程的進行，我們是努力求速，在三星期之內，我們完成了一個七百尺深和每分鐘能出四百加倫水的自流井，並為便利工程師日夜督工起見，特費了極短的時間完成了一座小洋房。去年五月十日，廠屋開始動工，一共用去八百餘根大木椿。在那炎熱的署天，尤其是在上海六十年來所未有奇熱的薯天之下，我們不顧一切，還是不斷的日夜開工。我們的鋼骨，本想在美國定製，那知美國工人正鬧風潮，所以我們從新設計，在上海搜集鋼骨材料，因此建築的時間，略受牽制。在屋頂未蓋之前，我們已開始建造鍋爐同蒸溜機等，如此夜以繼日地不停工作，終於二十三年十一月完成了各種重要工程，同時也就在這個時候開始製造酒精了。</p>
<p>我們知道，中國酒精廠是華僑初次投資創辦的一種事業，也就是我們華僑愛戴祖國的一種表示！工業落後的中國，待發展的事業很多，我們抱着愛國的精神，回國投資，希望中國在工業界的領袖中，能占着一個位置。</p>

<h3>挽回利權</h3>

<h3>酒精充代馬達燃料之研究</h3>
<p>— 林澤人</p>
<p>世界馬達燃料之供給，端賴乎汽油，邇來工業發達，動力機械之需用汽油者，不勝枚舉，例如汽車，汽船，貨車，飛機，及其他固定之引擎，每年產數，與日俱增，殊足驚人，於是汽車燃料之問題，亦為現代工業界所重視，而酒精充代汽油之研究，尤值吾人之注意焉。</p>
<p>夫地下煤油，由來已久，油礦之開發者，為數亦復不少，今欲再覓相當油礦頗非易事，雖不能斷定世上油礦，足供若干時之開採，然據專家者言，汽油斷絕之日，當亦不遠，據美國汽油技術局之統計，美國天然蘊藏之汽油，已用去者達百分之四十，長此以往，汽油終有恐慌之一日，其影響工業界前途，實匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>歐美日本各國，有見及此，遂圖種種補救方法，而其結果，則以酒精代替汽油為簡而易舉之事，現世界各國均已先後實行應用，其製配之成分，計有下列數種</p>
<p>（一）酒精，煤油之蒸溜物，及其他和合劑，</p>
<p>（二）酒精，瞇，及煤油之蒸溜物，</p>
<p>（三）酒精，瞇，及煤氣之誘導體，</p>
<p>（四）酒精，醐，加以變性或中和之藥劑，</p>
<p>第一二兩項，雖不能完全項替汽油，然足以减輕汽油消耗量，今歐洲各國業已强制施行矣，至第三項之配製成分中，有煤氣之誘導體，如舉Benzene，甲苯Toluol等原料，如價格較低，尚屬可取，惟於第四項，凡含有糖分及澱粉之原料，均可製造，取用不竭，最值吾人之注意，茲將各種配合法，舉例如下：</p>
<p>以酒精及　相混而充代汽油之發明，得有專利權者，有下開數種：</p>
<p>南非洲自一九一八年以還，卽以酒情充代汽油，其配合成分為</p>
<p>變性酒精　五十五分</p>
<p>醚　四十五分</p>
<p>氨等　約〇。二五分</p>
<p>據試騐此項燃料者言，酒精每加倫所行之哩數，與上等汽油之效率相較，相差無幾，其動力與速力，可與汽油相頡頏，且用酒精之引擎，旣不生銹，亦無震動之弊，而引擎上之炭積，亦不若用汽油者之多。</p>
<p>一九二〇年　香山酒精動力燃料發明家福士德氏，發明下列成分之配合</p>
<p>酒精　六三·三分</p>
<p>謎　三四·八分</p>
<p>煤油　一·三分</p>
<p>吡啶　〇·六分</p>
<p>依福氏之試騐，上列配方所得之効率與汽油相較，並無軒輊，當馬達冷寒之時。開動亦不困難，而引擎不遺炭積，且不生銹，尤其餘事也。</p>
<p>英屬桂那，製有Alcolene燃料，以酒精為主要原料，其成分如下如下：</p>
<p>酒精　六十五分</p>
<p>瞇　三十四分</p>
<p>煤油　〇·五分</p>
<p>苯胺　〇·七分</p>
<p>甲紫　加至現色</p>
<p>依照上列製配方法，其試騐之結果，亦甚可觀，而行駛之哩數，與汽油相較，可得百分之九十之効率。至於配合成分中，以瞇稍貴，是以試騐之時，每擬減少其量，庶合經濟之原則。設或摻加過度，則除價值上受其影響，卽引擊之化合器，亦受其率制也。蓋瞇之成分太多，化合器之溫度劇冷，溫度降至在露點之下，殊屬不妥。</p>
<p>茲據實騐所得，酒精燃料與汽油相較，有下列數優點：</p>
<p>（一）開動冷引幣時較用汽油者更便利。</p>
<p>（二）引擎及燃料部份，不積炭灰。</p>
<p>（三）加速力與汽油相等，甚或超之。</p>
<p>（四）疾駛之時。决無震動之弊。</p>
<p>（五）燃燒之溫度較用汽油者低。</p>
<p>（六）引擎不易生誘。</p>
<p>（七）每加倫之動力與哩數，可與汽油相等。</p>
<p>（八）每哩行駛之費用，較汽油為廉。</p>
<p>（九）潤滑油之消耗頗少。</p>
<p>（十）如遇因火失愼等事，可用水救熄之。</p>
<p>綜觀上列各點，酒精之足代替汽油也，已無疑問。吾國汽油，向籍舶來，一旦邊疆有事，動力燃料，立卽發生恐慌，故汽油代巷品問題之解决，實屬刻不容緩之舉，今本廠旣產鉅量之精酒，當設法作為汽油代用品，藉防漏巵於萬一，望國人共起而圖之。</p>

<h3>讀「中國銀行二十三年營業報告」</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>中國銀行之以一年來經濟金融以及貿易等等概况。彙編營業報告。公表於國人者。此其為第六次。自其內容觀察。取材之審愼。數字之正確。年有進步故皆今勝於昔。而其最足稱道者。當推對於白銀與通貨問題之分析。理解透澈。持論穩健。至其主張以建立與促進健全的與集中的經濟機構。為目前困難之補救對策。尤為一針見血之論。他如對於上海金融病態診斷之深切。我國二十三年國際收支推測之合理。國際貿易與農工業經濟分析之精密。猶其餘事。設再從於於國民經濟之生產問題。透視我國之現勢。則於該報告中。似亦不無可以提出商榷之點。茲就管見所及。略陳一二。以供各界之參考。</p>
<p>該報告於我國棉花之自給問題。以為「近來各處植棉面。積逐漸增加美種推廣。漸見成效……四五年問。焉知不能自給。」又云「中國粗絨棉花。向有三四千萬元之出口。若能急起直追。何嘗不可變入超為出超耶。」此其觀察以我人愚見。覺其失之樂觀過甚。何則。近年來美種推廣之漸收實效。事實固頗為鮮明。惟以國人經營各紗廠。仍以粗紗為主要出品。此種細絨美種。需求較弱。雖有大量之生產。銷路仍以洋商各廠為尼閭。復以昧於國情者之龍斷居奇。去歲新花上市之際。造成花價之變態奇昂。及至銀根緊急。紛求脫手。價值暴落。幾及最高價之四分之一。例如靈寶鄭州之細絨。好貨去年每担值六十二三元。最近曾至四十八九元。若以存貨尚有十五萬件（每件四担）計算棉商損失。幾逾二千萬元。而負其風險者。又捨銀行而英屬。反之，粗絨花以存貨有限。需求甚殷。所跌僅二三元之數。此其現象。殊堪注目。今後供求兩方。如何可以使其適合。最宜加以注意。而細絨過剩之僵局打破。亦應以華廠增紡細紗線為唯一之條件。否則長此以往。類似「穀賤傷農」之事件。行將見諸西北。而於美種之推廣。恐將反增其障礙。</p>
<p>再者，該報告於紗布及水泥輸出之减少。深致感慨。實則關册所載土貨紗布之輸往日本朝鮮者。卽係在華日紗廠之出品。此與我華資各廠。關係較淺。又水泥之輸出。啟新，中國，上海廣州等廠為數甚微。所謂民國二十年四十萬擔之出嚴厲紀錄。其中實以大連日商小野田洋灰會社之出品居其多數而華南之靑洲水泥公司亦居一部。惟自東北偽組織宣告成立。大連輸出數字。不見關册。而靑洲水泥公司又告停業。事實如此。是此項統計數字之减少。似未足視為水泥輸出特別衰落之佐證。</p>
<p>綜覜該報告之內容大體上殊足令人滿意。此其反映於事實者。卽係該行對於社會服務效能之增進。此則吾人之所甚欽佩者也。</p>

<h3>俄報評論東歐公約</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）伊斯維斯太報社論論述東歐區域互助公約、其言曰、「德國法西報紙為其反對此約之態度覓取根據計、乃竭力掩飾而指此約為法國外交之可惡陰謀、其目的在反對德國者、」該報復稱此項公約必須包括東歐全部國家、同時規定任何一國如遇攻擊、則須共同援助、該報證明、各國矛盾日益加深、軍備日益擴張、同時各國政府表示對於單純的不侵犯公約並不重視、故此類公約决不能令人發生安全之信念、至於東歐區域互助公約之觀念、乃發生於德國帝國主義以其重整軍備及德國國社黨之侵略政策、肆力跋巵之際、或謂東歐公約為一種秘密的複雜外交工具、而為外交界所不經見者、該報竭力否認此說、且謂就根本而言、羅迦諾條約、西方天空公約及東歐互助公約之建議、此三者並無不同之點、該報復論德波對東方公約之反對云、「任何人得日、德波如有侵略計劃、則彼等阻止此項公約之締結乃有理由、彼等如欲袪除此種不信任觀念、則彼等必須冋意締結此約」該報續云「當東歐公約談判之際、德國竭力擴張軍備、同時德國法西黨徒時在人民覜察者報」公開提出一種計劃、欲犧牲蘇聯波羅的海諸國及小協約國、以令今日版圖全部變更、一面向波蘭建議、發動此議、此等文字力稱、此項進攻將指向法國、是故身為此等計劃之目標之各國、必須起而締結區域互助公約、同時此約必須向一切願意加入之國家公開、彼不願加入者雖在暴露其自身之目的、唯决不能减弱此項和平武器之重要性」云（二十九日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>日報稱歐局不安　增進日本地位</h3>
<p>東京朝日新聞云、美國對於德國之破棄平和條約軍事條項、尚無鮮明之意思表示、蓋羅斯福大總統、鑑於過去日本在滿洲發生事變之情形、深恐表示意思後、多引起德國之反威、蓋美國之外交政策、仍避免搭入歐洲紛爭之渦中、故此次華盛頓官方、對於德國行動及於極東之影響、亦極加以深切之考慮、美國之態度、保持合衆國之威信、求通商上之機位均等、一方因英俄去極東注意歐大陸各問題以來、日本在極東之地位、逐漸優越、加以中東路讓波交涉成立、日俄關係好轉、華盛頓方面、以為德國之廢棄和約重整軍備直接受威脅者、俄比法為甚、因此俄國不得不與日本結友好關係、此即歐洲政局不安、反增進日本之俊越地位也、</p>

<p>布魯塞爾　衆議院今晨以一百零七票對五十四票及十二票棄權、通過貨幣貶價法案、此案係於昨日午後開始討論、直至今晨六時、尚未終結、前總理雅斯巴曾與齊蘭總理互相駁詰、雅氏謂、美國關於貨幣貶價所作試騐、非比國所可效顰、貨幣一經貶價、流弊所及、非施行通貨膨脹不可、一九二六年時、吾國貨幣曾經貶價一次、此際再度宣布貶價、旣足在社會上引起糾紛、而幣價一經貶低、卽無從加以穩定、雅氏并謂、一九二六年、比國貨幣價值、業已减低七分之六、當時政府曾發出諾言、謂當予以糾正、最近法國政府允以三十萬萬法郎、年息三厘半之鉅欵、貸予比國、俾用以維持匯市、比國政府竟乃加以拒絕、未免可異、繼由齊蘭總理起立作答、謂目今問題、當以經濟狀况為主、比國現金流出國外、並非國際投機人士所為、乃係比國人士所為、「此端尼斯前總理所由拒絕法國貸欵之議、」齊蘭以為貨幣貶價之後、貨物徐徐上升、則各項產業價值跌落過甚者、必將恢復其眞正價值云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美認比行動尙溫和</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日表示其對於比國貨幣局勢之意見、謂依渠觀之、比幣貶值之計劃、尚屬溫和、不致使競爭局勢愈臻危險、但果比幣貶值之結果為美國出受不正當之競爭、則美國當採必要辦法以補救之云、現開愛姆斯特丹與巴黎兩處有價值二千五百萬元之黃金運來紐約、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）官方今日宣稱、比國之貨幣貶價計畫不致影響比美商約、聞華盛頓官塲不信比幣之貶價將予商業以絕大打擊、但商約中一條規定通貨變遷損及兩國中任何一國之商業時得修改此商約云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）半官方面表示、比國之金融恐慌、使世界愈近貨幣穩定、但若干人則住世界準備穩定貨幣前、法國波蘭瑞士及比國、將具體放棄金本位、據稱、除此點外比國之現狀於美國之金融及經濟極少影饗、金融界一致承認現距國際貨幣穩定仍遠、世界市塲因比國之金融恐慌將有一調整貨幣之時機、金融家不住比國舉動將引起世界貨幣戰爭云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>比幣減値對日影響</h3>
<p>（東京）比利時减低幣價百分之二十五後、安定匯兌之具體政策仍未成立　今次减低幣價之結果、比幣能否安定、又金本位國之命運如何、日財界方面注目其前途、據大藏省之見解、比國本身雖一時不免混亂、然不久可以安定、對於日本並無直接影響、不然北對荷蘭及法國之影響如何、與日本有關係、對於此盡加以特別警戒、卽比利時實行减低幣價、一時停止金本位、而與比有密接關係之荷蘭、如减低幣價、則日本對荷印貿易、必受直接打　、同時對於金本位集團與以重大影響、法國雖維持愼重態度、世界的通貨安定、非但不可期望、將來並加其複雜性、（三十日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）比幣價减低、對於金本位集團之影響如何、據匯兌銀行之觀察如左、金本位聯盟崩壞發生時、國際匯兌反將安定之機會、因此國際匯兌絕高競爭、將有激化之可能性、荷蘭及瑞士之資本、向何方面流出、為堪注目之事、誌資金大致不流入巴黎、或折換鎊幣、促進英美·英法·匯兌之昂騰、萬一由倫敦方面收買黃金、以致黃金行情昂騰、則鎊價反向下跌落、如資金向美國流出、則成為英美匯價跌落之原因、其間接影饗使日本對美匯價高　或跌落、（三十日日聯電）</p>

<h3>西北視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>武威惡俗及西路概況</p>
<p>隴省西路、文化落伍、纏足惡習、多未革除、酒泉及關外三縣、尚不少天足之婦女、高台臨澤武威等縣、則時見童女之初纏、尤其武威四十里堡等村、雜貨舖中、懸售弓鞋木底、購者頗夥、可見纏足之風猶在盛行、凡汽車軋軋過處、纏足婦女、聞聲出視、舉步艱難、恒用女伴攙行、否則兩手力向外抓、以支持體重、一步一幌、若將傾倒、且纏足婦女、家庭非常舊式、遵守所謂大門不出二門不逛之古訓、至有「甥入舅家拜年、被犬撕破新衣、舅家婦女絕不輕出照拂」之事、又若叩門問有人否、家無男子、女眷必答「無人」、一似婦女非人也者、此種風氣、例不勝舉、據臨洮友人杜靜山談、隴南錮俗、且較西路為甚、影響所至、弱身弱種、害不勝言、以武威敎育論、縣立學校、計城內設高小二、初小四、婦女校一、城外高小二、初小數十、尙有敎會所設中小學兩三所、數量不可謂少、此放足運動、倘　學界能負責推進、成效必有可觀、深望當地知識階級、慨然以移風易俗自任也、</p>
<p>武威東西一百九十里、南北四百一十里、（內南山嶺脈占二百七十里）可耕地有一萬一千餘頃、人口約計廿二萬餘、特產鴉片、貨高價昂實為該縣一大收入、且為西路鴉片之集中地、每屆姻會、商賈雲集、戲班妓女聯袂齊來、商業驟然興盛、為西路所未有、姻會一過、忽又驟形冷落、毒卉盛行、因此沿途所見、多為鳩形鵠面習染烟癖之輩、據聞男子吸姻人數、約占百分之五十、女子較少、然亦占百分之三十、晚入民戶閒串、中老年夫婦、大半橫臥炕上、對燈吸姻、幷各戲噴見女、見有客至、僅口呼「坐」、而稍縮其腿、卽自嗤嗤吸食如故、遠客深覺駭異、鄉人則視若常事、毒害所至、貧弱隨之、典當旣盡，不恤　賣妻女、於是販賣人口之風、遂亦特甚、無論城鄉、販賣女子之人牙子、隨處皆有、普通在十四歲以下之女子、有幾歲則給銀幾元、（西路各縣童養媳身價、亦多以此為標準、）十五六至二十一二歲、則數十數百元不等、賣後非成墮溷之花、卽為富室之婢、（甘肅各縣、官僚富賈所蓄婢女、多為武威人、）此等惡俗、官廳方面固應嚴厲取締、對於人牙子及人販子、盡法懲治、然根本辦法、仍在早日禁絕姻毒、取消苛捐雜稅、人民無凍餒之憂、自不至賣男　女也、</p>
<p>甘肅西路各縣、面積廣大、除極少數之沙漠外、多為農牧兩宜之沃壤、在省境中、實佔重要部份、地勢自東徂西、長二千數百里、除朱家井·烏沙嶺·水泉驛·峽口鎭等、數短程山路共約二百里外、其餘槪屬平原、交通上無論自蘭州赴新疆、靑海至張掖、包甯至甘凉、均可依大車驛道、建築鐵路、現所通行之長途汽車、亦特藉用驛道而已、</p>
<p>士質、蘭州至永登、係白土質、水甚深、尤其俞家灣一帶、乾燥異常、永登至烏沙嶺、以產馬羊聞、皆草原也、古浪至武威永昌間、地面平曠、耕荒互見、山丹東樂張掖臨澤高台等縣、水渠交錯、土地肥腴、尤以高台臨澤為最、高台至酒泉金塔鼎新間、除近城較有水利外、其他多係砂礫磽瘠之地、安敦玉三縣、面積廣大、可比浙省、惟多沙漠、在得蘇賴河及黨河水利處、土地亦頗肥腴、各縣因接近祁連及靑海蒙古高原、故氣候較寒、</p>
<p>各縣水利、民十五以前、因雨雪依時、祁連積雪、至夏消融成河、酒張等縣田地、賴以灌漑、且地廣人稀、耕老所穫較豐、生活尚裕、祇以懶惰成性、不知興辦水利、及民十七八年後、常遭亢旱、山雪不豐、河水不旺、每年收成、不及共半、農民生活、遂頓感困苦、茲後為救濟農村起見、亟須速聞河渠、廣暢水源、如高台安西敦煌等縣、掘地三尺卽見泉源、掘井灌田、尤覺便利也、</p>
<p>物產以小麥小米及鴉片為大宗、高台棉花、張掖大米、亦頗著名、永登民勤、水昌山丹各縣、則盛產牛羊駝馬、尤以永屬岔口驛馬為最佳、此外如玉門石油、武成大黃、酒泉肅州石、山丹羔羊皮、祁述山金　石煤及石棉、烏沙嶺以西、到處產煤炭、民勸更特產無烟媒、皆西路有名之寶　也、</p>
<p>各縣農村經濟、在民十五以前、年歲豐登、捐稅輕微、頗形安定、後因十六年地震、十七八年旱災、以及兵匪騷擾、賦稅繁重、號稱特產之鴉片、往年暢銷平津東北、一年產銷所得、可供二年之用、今則東北淪亡、熱貨入銷平津、西貨無法東運、經濟來源、遂形枯滯、一般人民生活、所衣無間寒暑、所食餽粥難繼、田地賦重價跌、有賣無買、重利高達十分、尚告貸無門、而縣區土劣又勾結官吏、多方臉削、因此民不聊生、多棄田而　、戶口年有减少、殊非前途之佳象也、</p>

<p>創辦經過　酒精為工業上之重要原料、亦為工業上之重要溶濟、為用頗廣、近年我國工業逐漸發達、酒精需要、亦與時俱進、惟年來此項酒精、大都輸自外國、漏巵至鉅、實業部有鑒於此、早將其列為實業部應行興辦基本工業之一、乃一面籌劃設廠、一面從事研究及試騐、以資準備、適華僑黃江泉等從海外歸來、謀國內民族工業之勃興、爰與實業部承商創辦官商合資大規模的新式酒精廠、該廠資本原定一百萬元、嗣增加為一百五十萬元、在上海浦東白蓮涇購地百五十畝為廠址、於二十三年五月開始建築廠屋、十一月中旬、機械安裝完竣、開始試車、十二月着手製造、十二月十五日、開始蒸溜、品質極為醇良、每日產量約三萬公斤、（約合七千加倫）</p>
<p>內容概況　該廠廠基、佔地四十畝、全廠槪用鋼筋混泥土及鋼樑所建、屋高九十尺、外觀極為宏偉、內部留有空屋、以備擴充之用、</p>
<p>該廠董事長為建源公司監督黃江泉氏、董事則有黃浴沂·梅哲之·劉鴻生·等、主持廠務者、卽係黃氏、製造及分析方面、均聘富有經騐之人員分別主持、故工作效能甚高、</p>
<p>設備概況　該廠機械係向英國定購、蒸溜器之精良、無出其右、所用機械、可以兼用縠類薯類及較蜜為原料、其設備之完善、卽在歐美各國、亦不多覯、設備部份之重要者、有穀類原料處理室·蒸煮糖化室·發芽室·冲淡室·醱酵室·蒸溜室·化騐室·裝罐室等、此外如蒸汽之供給·電力之發動·原料之貯藏·成品之收藏·水之來源·火患之預防·等等、莫不有最新設備、允稱全國第一、不愧並駕歐美</p>
<p>擴充計劃　該廠建有製造炭酸氣之廠房、以備將來安裝機伴、製造液體炭酸氣及乾冰之用、該廠將來產量每日約二〇公噸、可供全國酒精之消耗、其他如純粹酒精、醇精及汽車燃料等工廠、亦在積極籌備中、</p>
<p>按我國目下酒精工業、尚甚幼稚、大規模之酒精工廠、尤不多觀、此偉大酒精廠之創設、所製出品、差可杜塞一部份之漏巵、其有裨於中國實業之前途、實甚大云、</p>

<h3>東華西捕結果退票　萬象華行兇肇禍　裁判庸弱掀起軒然大波　觀衆擁進球塲大打出手　協進會辦公室門窗搗毀</h3>
<p>東華西捕昨在申園作西聯足球甲組賽於申園、東華以戴麟經馮運佑之缺席、陣容不振、遂與西捕成勢均力敵之勢、表演雖無精彩、局勢則甚緊張、裁判員能力似未見高明、東華屢次興師問罪、責難裁判、一部份無智觀衆、於是興波助瀾、聲勢洶洶、最後以萬象華對裁判員倍能之一脚一掌、趁火打刦之一部份觀衆羣越鉛絲網入場、計有五六百人之多、包圍裁判員及西捕巡邊員毆打、秩序大亂、形勢嚴重、時在下半時卅分鐘時、衆不敵寡、竟有觀衆二人反被西捕毆傷、</p>
<p>肇禍原因</p>
<p>裁判員倍能、能力方面、實未高明、而東華不加願諒、一再責難繼以行兇、殊失錦標隊之令譽、而球員之道德、亦喪失盡凈矣、更以一部份無智觀衆、向喜興風作浪、無事生非、今見東華球員尚然如此、此事遂益發不可收拾矣、比賽過程中、裁判員罰東華幾次犯規、引起不滿之聲、上半時成一比一、下半時又成二比二後、因關洵安之犯乎球被罰十二碼球、東華認為關並未以乎觸球、向之交涉、裁判員不理、卽下令罰球、東華未及防備、球乃被踢入、東華以二比三負、觀衆大起喧嘩、中央開球李義臣遠送一球、落在裁判員身旁、萬象華趕前竞向裁判員腹部一脚、裁判員認為有意踢人、開除資格、時四周觀衆羣呼打打、一部份竟衝入場去、萬象華復向裁判員一記耳光、觀衆亦已入事、乃打作一團、</p>
<p>二人流血</p>
<p>萬之一脚一掌、實為肇禍之首、此種行為、殊非高尚而有名球員所應有者、西捕巡邊員亦被包圍毆打、西捕球員一部份保護裁判員離場一部份被包圍互毆、秩序大亂、比賽當然不得不停止、有觀衆二人、被西捕球員毆擊流血、有名姚祥生者被毆傷頭臉部、另一人被傷鼻子及嘴唇、由體育協進會代為洗滌包紮、事後觀衆叙集不敬、竞向體協會要求退票、後經曹家渡公安局警察趕到彈壓、並由體協會貼出佈告、以慰羣衆、至晚七時許方陸續散去、</p>
<p>磚石亂飛</p>
<p>當千餘觀衆、開始衝毀籬笆、擁進球場時、裁判員倍能卽在三西人警探護衛之下、匆匆出協進會邊門、上汽車避去、連衣服亦無暇更換、同時另一西警即搖電話向戈登路捎房報告、不移時、延平路上、巳開到大批巡捕、維持秩序、但中園門內、為六區地界、故彼等只在路上警戒、此時千餘觀衆、在暴氣盛怒之下、復將協進会辦公室、團團包圍、叫喊不巳、其勢可怕、於是又開始亂飛磚石、將恊進會玻璃窗、在砰零劈拍之下、擊毀無遺、狂呼退票、聲震雲霄、</p>
<p>警察無法</p>
<p>包圍於協進會辦公室內者、有協進會總幹事沈嗣良及其他職員數人、室外祗六區派來之警士七八人、力即薄弱、無濟於事、只能任其所之乃急電六區報告、以六區警力亦微、乃復直急向大東門總局報告、要求派警察大隊前來擁持、一小時後、六區區長率警士十餘人至、場外之可怕狀態稍减、然而一時仍無法驅散叫器之千餘羣衆、</p>
<p>結果退票</p>
<p>六區區長不欲事態擴大、乃命警士召入所謂自稱羣衆之代表兩人、經兩人詳述、滔滔不絕、實則代表自為代表、場外之觀衆、其目的不過在趁火打刦、要求退票而已、最後沈嗣良見勢成無法可想、乃毅然答應退票、於是由警士將觀衆退入場中、依次發給六角門票一張、魚貫出門、六角門票、共計發出六百餘張、而一羣騷騷擾擾之觀衆、方才退出、一場風波、歸於平息、</p>
<h3>今日申園無比賽　東華對英尼斯改期</h3>
<p>自昨日東華對西捕在申園比賽發生糾紛後、今日尚有東華對英尼斯之賽、亦在申園、因昨日之事尚未解决、故今日申園封關、比賽取消、</p>
<p>戴馮缺席陣容平平</p>
<p>昨日東華對西捕之球戰、因關係錦標者較少、東華方面、巳冠軍一席、穩司到手、故而大將戴麟經及馮運佑、臨時缺席、戰來平平、無甚精彩、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<p>東華隊</p>
<p>陸鍾恩</p>
<p>李寗　關洵安</p>
<p>顧尚　　丁兆成　馮念華</p>
<p>萬象華　陳家球　李義臣　張鏡海　賈幼良</p>
<p>西捕隊</p>
<p>台斯稻</p>
<p>休脫　墨維</p>
<p>赫雷　吉勃生　墨買</p>
<p>活根生　鮑台　威利　倍達　烏　威</p>
<p>嗚笛概啟西捕逞雄</p>
<p>三時正、鼓頻催、鳴笛一聲、雙方健兒各逞奮勇、憔初時我方大將李義臣尚未到、更以戴鱗經馮運佑二將之缺席、致為西捕攫得良機、一帆風順、直入東華勝地、活根生鮑台等、頻送秋波、頗有使東華各人、難以招架之慨、嗣關李諸內衛、奮力禦抗、李義臣又到塲參戰戎機、大局得以挽救、東華四及居上風、</p>
<p>刀來槍去各獲一球</p>
<p>惟西捕隊不甘示弱、不五分鐘、前綫諸將、又逞活躍、活根生取得良機、帶球直入、李寗等邊疆發難、共起勤王、仍未有效、活將球猛擊一下、幸喜陸鍾恩防犯有力、將球救出、嗣馮念華在東華亂離之際、被罰十二碼球、西捕中鋒威利、脚尖加油、傾力一擊、應聲入網、以一與〇之局、首開紀錄、自是東華雪恥心維、各自奮起、丁兆成右顧左盼、坐鎭中央、張鏡海萬象華陳家球等、先後開拔、直搗黃龍、李義臣得小萬傳遲、勇猛而前、鐵騎起處、塵姻飛揚、剎那間以輕巧之方法、攫球入網、遂造成一與一之和局、是時雙方各有衛突、均以營救得當、並無得失、上半時仍以一與一終局、</p>
<p>下半時西捕先得功</p>
<p>下半時後、兩方各奪逞威、以决雌雄、東華方面、以人數生疏、聯絡未見佳妙、而西捕亦以非昔比、不甚出色　戰多時、烏特威轉遞一球、與活根生、斜刺而往、陸鍾恩營救無方、徒喚奈何、祇得聽之入網、西捕乃以二比一、又居勝利、東華諸將、並不客氣、小萬發難上前、以一球傳與李義臣、經顧尚動之臂助、李乃得入一球、成二與二之和局、</p>
<p>十二碼球引起禍肇</p>
<p>旣以二比二成和局、雙方以勝負關健所緊、各不相讓、嗣球入東華門首、西捕烏特威、得機關出角球、關洵安防衛甚周、見球旣抵門前、縱身一躍、球自關之頭部謂其身體滾下、當時該球滾胸腹而下時、倍能指關犯手球、判罰十二碼球、是時東華各球員、以關未犯手球、表示不滿、遂向其解釋、倍能不聽、竞嗚笛啓球、是時東華諸將、物向倍能解釋、冷不防倍竟下令開球、欲待準備、早已不及球乃經西捕隊球員衝入網內、</p>
<p>小萬行兇打成一片</p>
<p>十二碼球旣往被西捕打入、東華乃以二比三屈居下風、東華更以此球罰得冤枉、隊長幹事當場向裁判員抗議無效、裁判員令中央開球、東華態度、殊為不良、中央開球、李義臣遠送一球、落在裁判身旁、萬象華趕上、對裁判員腹部一脚、裁判員認為有意踢人、當即開除小萬、時觀衆興波助瀾、聲勢洶洶、萬象華一不做、二不休、復向裁判員一記耳光、時觀衆巳越鉛絲網入場、包圍裁判員西捕球員及西捕巡邊員打成一片、西捕球員一部份保護裁判員倍能離場、一部份被包圍互毆、結果華人觀衆受傷者二人、秩序十分紊亂、為球賽糾紛案中從來未有者、</p>
<p>出事之後要求退票</p>
<p>出事之後、球賽即中止舉行、但觀衆則紛紛要求退票、有一部份觀衆、約五百餘人、直待時下午七時、當未退去、中華全國體育恊進會、乃貼一佈告於門前云、「今日比賽、公正人之裁判、有不滿意之處、本會當向上海西人足球會提出交涉、尚望各位觀衆安心言旋」、觀衆仍不散、乃推派代表二人、前往向體育協進會要求退票、及賠償傷者醫藥費、經市公安局曹家渡分局長汪大燧親往勸解、衆始散去、</p>
<h3>西聯會甲組賽　優游可得亞軍　昨以五比二勝法商會　今日最後一點對西捕</h3>
<p>優游足球隊昨日下午與法商作甲組賽於　園、前往觀者、僅　　百人、然東呼西喊、頗不寂寞、比賽結果、優游以五比二擊敗法商、今日最後一戰對西捕、查西捕曾以四對一敗於優游、今日二次相逢、優游取勝、當可預期、故亞軍一席、有如囊中之物、茲將昨賽情形述下、</p>
<p>上半時優游佔先</p>
<p>戰慕揭開後、此攻彼守、賽來工力界敵、局勢極為平物、孫錦順陳士凱曾有數度絕佳之攻門機會、均因差以毫厘、失之交臂、相持約二十分鐘之久、奚巧生角底橫傳、敵內衛二度失足、陳士凱伺候在側、迎球一脚、破網而入、曾幾何時、奚巧生得鍾勇森之援助、沿邊直入、巧獲第二球、法商不甘示弱、努力反攻、前鋒大華特運球推進、江善敬誤犯手球、被罰十二碼、馬山兒奔上一脚、不料球彈門柱而回、優游僥倖晚險後、前鋒乃大肆猛攻、然至上半時終、再無所獲、擾游乃以二對零佔先、</p>
<p>劉鼻相繼建奇功</p>
<p>下半時開始、法商內衛馬山兒調任中鋒、軍容果然大振、惜最後一着、輒付流水、十分鐘過後、鍾勇森邊陲傳中、奚巧生對門力擺、敵守門將一在握之球、依然滑出、劉祖儒見機而作、奔上一撥、球乃入網、法商至此、反攻甚力、馬山兒得球傳左、左翼蒙諾特得球橫傳、小華特描準力射、球由右下角而入、此球之失、由於王守門跑出過早、移時孫錦順在人叢中攻入一球、造成四與一之比、</p>
<p>小華特頭上開花</p>

<h3>中國銀行　廿三年度營業報告</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>民國二子三年，長江共禍，獲見肅淸；中原各省，益形安定。即邊隅各地，東北姑置勿論，西北尚無重大事故；蜀中流竄之匪，勢已窮蹙；東粵相持之局，亦漸融解。而中央與各地方當局積極建設，如公路之增築，水利之設施，輕工業之改進，隴海路之展至西安，粵漢與南玉綫之趕造。此類工作，急速進展，國家經濟建設，不難形成；統一基礎，即可樹立。同時南洋各埠，漸復繁榮；僑胞滙欵，未見减少。是此一年中，政治經濟之進步，皆皎然可覩。所憾者，水旱之災，遍湘，鄂，贛，蘇，浙，皖，閩，冀，陝，甘，滇，綏十二省之廣，災民在千萬以上；收穫損失，不可數計；由是促進外米之輸入，增加內銀之外流。我工商業處境之艱困，原爲中外所共曉；孰意美國更有抬高銀價之舉，是不啻身將落井，又遭下石，創痛之深，甯可忍受？欲期打破難關，厥在自給自立；希望國人勿存畏縮之念，前途否泰，事在人爲。爰將一年來經濟金融以及貿易等等概况，臚述於後，以供參考。</p>
<p>白銀出口徴稅</p>
<p>去年報告書中，論及銀價問題，早經慮到銀高影響，足以動搖我國民經濟之基礎。若國外再施以人爲方法，制定法案，提高銀價，則更促進生銀之輸出。爲中國計，極願各國繼續倫敦經濟會議時穩定銀價之初旨。不料未及數月，倫敦協定各國尚未完全簽竣；而美國國會已貿然通過購銀條例；美國政府即從事在公開市場收買生銀。於是中國市塲銀價，與國外生銀價格之差價，愈離愈遠；輸出有利可圖，遂紛紛運出國外。其上海每月平均滙兌行市與倫敦銀價核算之平價最高差價爲十一月份之低於平價三·九一八四便士；最低差價爲一月份之高於平價零·一七八九便士；自七月起，至十月止，共出口銀　億零七百餘萬元。此時政府預防發生人心恐慌起見，於十月十五日决定徵收出口稅，並徵平衡稅，以防止生銀之繼續出口。當時中外人士，對於政府徵收銀稅之舉，有贊否兩說：贊成者謂：美國購銀政策不變，差價愈大，中國之存銀，不難頃刻吸收殆畫；目在繼續輸出之中，足以引起人心恐慌，招致金融風潮；反對者謂：中國人民，習於固有之銀幣：一旦政府對於銀幣之內容，加以减損；或於其流通之方法，加以干涉，反足以引起人民爭藏銀幣之心。而外國人民之安心投資中國，由於銀幣之自由流通；設徵收銀稅，中國幣值减低，外國資本，無法招致；且以外人對於中國幣制有所懊疑，已有之資本，勢將逃避國外。且平衡稅愈高，私運愈甚，顧以事實證之，自徵收銀稅之後，十一，十二兩月，僅各出口一千一百餘萬元；與八月份之七千九百四十餘萬元相比較，尚不及百分之二十；同時以上海銀根日緊，滙兌銀價日高；故平衡稅未致抬高，十一月平均爲七·一，％十二月平均爲六·四％，私運並未如反對說者預料之甚。而十一·十二兩月內地之需用現銀，亦大半山於土貨登棋；人民埋藏之風，亦未觸發，是則未始無裨於金融安定也。</p>
<p>顧美國若竟實行準備中金三銀一，購足生銀二十四億盎斯；則即吸收中·印兩國全部存銀而猶未足。中國生銀流出之影響，徵之已往事實，不特不能增加中國人民之購買力；而反减低其購買力，本年進口數量較之去年减少三億一千餘萬元，此其明證。是美國之購銀政策，繼續不變，將使中國人民購買力降至極度；與美國參議員所高唱之增加東方人民購買力之主張，不啻背道而馳。彼等是否完全味於中國生銀所占之地位，及中國之經濟實體，而作此理想之談？抑明知其非是而作此說以惑生產者貫澈銀派之中張？或竟藉此以抬高中國之幣值，使中國之工業與出口貿易减其競爭之力；而以增進美國生產品之出路，餌美國之民衆耶？今中國政府已一再向美國政府聲述美國購銀政策之危害及於中國之經濟，美國政府幸已諒解，購銀之淮行，漸見和緩。但望美國參議員諸君，同意於必先抬高物價而後銀價之抬高有利於用銀國；及非世界用銀國共同合作，不能得銀價之長久安定，二大不可磨滅之論，更易其主張，則此占世界人口四分之一之中國國民經濟，能不因美國銀政策而瀕於崩潰，從此發揚滋長；共有裨於將來美國之東亞貿易者，豈今日一時銀價抬高之區區小利，所可比儗其萬一耶？</p>
<p>健全通貨</p>
<p>予全國人心以莫大之安全者，厥惟政府不採賤價通貨政策，而絕對維持健全通貨之表示。蓋自美國購銀政策實行之後，一般神經銳敏者，咸懷疑政府將集中現金，實行不兌換紙幣，或减輕貨幣成色，浮言紛起。及九月初政府宣布滙兌管理法後，外商深信政府必有進一步之舉動；即開始資本逃避，輸出生銀，自七月至十月，總額爲　億零七百餘萬元。自白銀徵稅，則咸認爲政府之目的，不僅阻止白銀流出，將以减低紙幣值爲實行賤價通貨之先聲：容或中國資本階級，亦紛紛購進外幣，將資本逃出國外，勢更未易收拾，幸政府負責當局，共同表示决無减低成色，集中現金，實行紙幣政策之舉，人心爲之大定。不特中國資本之逃避，因而杜塞；即人民埋藏之風，亦隨以阻遏。近政府復宣布新進口之生銀，重出口可以免稅，更足以證明政府加稅之目的，至於阻止出口；而不在於貨幣之低值。此一年間，金融風潮之鼓盪，時有風雨欲來之勢；而卒能安然無恙者，不得不謂政府維持健全通貨之功也。蓋中國人民尚生活於數千年傳統用銀習慣之中，近始漸漸習用紙幣；而人民之視紙幣，仍爲銀若干之代表。設幣值變更，即對於一切通貨不加信任；於是爭藏現銀，信用某礎，隨之動搖。至本年存銀之减少。實不足爲今日之大患。計自民國元年至二十三年白銀進口十三億九千四百萬元，出口四億零八百萬元，净進口白銀共九億八千六百餘萬元，國內積滯白銀，雖無精確之調查，據估計有二十五億盎斯，合有三十三億元；以各省造幣廠自前淸以夾之鑄數計之，有二十一億三千三百萬元，减各省造幣廠鎔燬之數約二億六千七百萬元，再以前淸銀九（二億八千六百萬元）假定十分之九業經鎔燬，有二億五千七百萬元，則可知現在之流通數額，尚有十六億元。此二億數千萬元之銀量出口，不過六分之一。政府果能始終維持健全通貨政策，則散在人民手中之十三四億元之銀貨。　嘗不可吸聚一部份，以補足今日出口之缺數；是政府確立健全之發行制度，逐漸推行健全之銀行紙幣，以代傳統的用銀習慣。蓋政府之維持健全通貨政策，旣已收一時之大效；何不推而廣之，增加健全之通貨數量？不特解决自前之困難；抑且可進而躋於現代國際經濟組織之林，當局者其注意於斯乎！</p>
<p>健全與集中的經濟機構</p>
<p>自世界不景氣以來，各國挽救　　　　　幣則禁現出口，减輕成色，現金集中；在匯兌則匯兌管理，貶低匯價，匯兌集中　　　　貿易則增加關稅，現定輸出入比例，實行物物交換。凡此種種，雖屬一時之補救；而依其國情之不同，各有相當之效果。有識者因有何以不以此種方策，應用一二於中國之疑問。驟視之，似未見有必不適用之阻礙；顧一考實際，則有大不然者。中國之經濟組織，猶是近代的國家以前之經濟組織；中國之經濟機構，猶是近代資本主義以前之經濟機構；論貨幣，則猶是現銀本位，並無統一之幣制，並無集中之發行。銀幣散藏民間，無術集中；即减輕成色，亦不能得通貨膨脹之實利；論滙兌，操於各國銀行者，居其大數；屬於華商銀行者，僅一小部份；有治外法權，有通商口岸之關係，無法澈底管理滙兌；在現金與匯兌未集中以前，更無貶低匯價之可能；論貿易，則以外交之實際關係，關稅未臻完全自主，豈易限制數量？而輸出入之同業，又無健令集中組織；即欲以自力統制，亦不可能。是捷徑非不可取，急救非不可行；獨奈機構未備，有捷徑而無途可闢，有急救良方而人之本體不宜接受。今日中國果欲採取近代資本主義之經濟方策，以抵抗世界潮流，補救目前困難；則於建立及促進健全與集中之經濟機構，實有刻不容緩之勢，在通貨宜迅速確定統一幣制與集中發行之實施；在金融機關宜分業合作，確立統系，聚散爲整；在貿易宜集中貿易機關，及改進同業公會，以人民自身力量，實行統制；在農產之改進推廣，與夫運銷積儲，固宜通力合作；即工業之咸輕成本，推廣銷路，亦有聯合集中之必要；即無輪幣制，金融，產業，貿易，舉凡一切經濟生活機關，均以政治及社會之　　促其集中，使之健全；則保持舊習慣，舊常態，令其安渡雖關亦可；即應用國外新方法，新捷　，以抵抗世界潮流，上無不可。否則等於五官四肢，殘缺不全，終致心臟血脈，無法展其效能；或猶如虛弱之軀，雖有名醫補劑而不能×。故健今與集中經濟機構之建立，誠爲基本工作；同時亦爲急　良方，徵以俄意兩國先例，宜於極短期間中促成之；更於累月經年中改進之。若一般國民視此爲　遠之談，而甯拾一二新穎名詞以相號召，則不獨人心之難於穩定；抑且歧途之易於誤入矣！</p>
<p>上海金融</p>
<p>白銀問題發生以來，上海一埠所感受之影響，最爲深切。其他各埠平日銀根之鬆緊，以上海爲轉移：當然亦不無影響；但逈不如上海之嚴重。至內地則幾視若無事；更有以上海之紛擾爲不可思議者。蓋中國之經濟組織，就一般論：尚在幼稚的農業經濟狀態中：而在通商口岸因有外人勢力之關係，其經濟發達之程度，與非通商口岸若霄壤之別；而通商口岸中之上海一埠，尤以地理歷史之關係，幾爲各國在中國之經濟勢力集中之地，所有新式的經濟組織之工具，無不應有盡有；是以一旦發生特殊事故，上海所感受之影響，最爲迅速而尖銳。白銀問題釀成之經濟恐慌，獨嚴重於上海，又奚足怪？不過正唯上海之特殊關係，不能以上海一隅之恐慌，概論中國之全體；此於內地各處之安堵如常，足以證之。故因白銀問題而發生之上海經濟困難，若欲論其如何救濟之方，先須考其何以特殊之點。</p>
<p>近數年來，上海一埠之金融發展，與內地絕不相同者，爲信用之過度膨脹。此固由內地匪亂頻仍，災荒交迫，土產衰落，外貨湧進；亦由銀價低落，外商之擁有銀資金者，暫儲以求投資利潤；於是中外銀行之存銀，愈儲愈多，自十七年底之一億七千一百萬至二十一年底之五億四千七百萬，五年之間，增加三億八千六百萬元。現金增加之結果，爲信用膨脹；信用膨脹，必先擴充投資之圍範；其始擴充事業，或工廠，或公司，以資金之易於借入，得以少額之資本，創造巨大之事業；其繼抬高地價，因事業增加而發生地產之需要增加，進而以地產之經營爲業：於是資金之消納益易；而地價之抬高，漫無限制。同時政府因財政關係，發行鉅額公債，六，七年間，總額達十萬萬元以；此外復有各省地方公債，公司社債及市機關債票之發行。良以工商事業，需要人才技術，推廣不易；獨地產與公債之投資，不費舉手之勞；所以已往信用之膨脹，十之八九在地產與公債，此為不可忽視之上海特殊情形。本年六月白銀問題發生以後，中國各銀行之存銀，以五月底與十二月底相較，祇減少五千七百寓元；而外國銀行之存銀减少二億零三百萬元；是上海資金之减少，不在中國金融機關而在外國金融機關；信用之收縮，不在中國各銀行而在外商銀行，此爲明顯之事實。至於公債，其信用支持，多賴華商銀行，不若地產周轉，多賴洋商。故白銀問題發生以後，地價一落千丈；則公債仍依然維持高價；此於中外之資金信用收縮，實有相連之關係。况乎公債之膨脹，旣有基金收入之增加，即爲眞實的膨脹，不若地價之抬高，並不因人口事業之增加，不得不謂爲虛偽的膨脹。故信用膨脹，投資於地產與公價則同。而地產與公債之膨脹虛實，則又不同。</p>
<p>是上海經濟恐慌中，最顯著之病態，爲地產之不流通；而造成此病態之原因，旣知其一爲過度的膨脹；爲外資之收縮；則欲論救濟之方，當使此虛偽之膨脹，復於眞實；即使地價與收益之比例，與目下市塲利率相稱。質言之：房租須與社會生活狀態相稱，不至有屋而無租主；或有租主而無力付租。規定合理的租金，法律上予以有效之保障，使房主有租可收。其在並無實際需要之地點，不可因地產催贖或因不能生利而冉加借建築。如此數年之後，當不難恢復健全常態。在此過渡期間，受押者酌减利息，俾地主得略輕負擔，勉力應付。同時上海外商應知上海之繁榮，中外人同其休戚，幸勿以關係全國之白銀問題，與上海地方金際併爲一談；更勿以全國白銀問題不能解决，即認爲上海金融無法救濟；此猶吾中國人勿以上海金融之困難，而即認爲內地金融無法維持。吾中國各銀行深感調劑金融責任之重；亦望各外商銀行，共同努力，恢復舊狀，以維持上海之繁榮。至其他工商各業，今後將受信用收縮之影響，而益感窘困；但我金融界對於以資金增加生產，而非爲流出國外者，仍當竭力維持；希望工商各業，懲前毖後，盡力設法整理內部，减輕成本；則今日之禍，焉知非來日之福耶？</p>
<p>任何國家，一旦發生經濟恐慌，其遭受窘困者，往往希冀通貨膨脹：唯上海現象之所以造成，由於已往之信用過度膨脹，及今日之局部忽然收縮；其收縮者，不特信用特用；抑且及於信用基礎之現銀；故今日欲解除困難，必須填補此局部之收縮；而需要填補者，乃爲現銀及以現銀爲基礎之信用。欲增加現銀或以現銀爲基礎之信用，則不外鼓勵逃避之外資，重復輸入；或吸收內地窖藏之現銀，爲發行準備，增加通貨。舍此兩途，而欲將非現銀爲基礎之信用增加，以圖奏效，恐無濟也。</p>
<p>中國白銀之流出，近因固由美國之購銀；而遠因仍根於國際支出之超過。中國國際收支，雖不易得其確數；然於金銀之輸出，足以證明國際收入之不敵支出，爲最明顯之事實。二十二年度金銀净輸出爲八千三百萬元，私運生金約一億二千萬元；本年則金銀之輸出，爲三億一千一百萬元，私運金銀約七千萬元；合計二十二年爲二億元，二十三年爲三億八千萬元；是兩年來國際收支之差額，日見加增。實則近年上海存銀之增加，即中國各地輸出人不能相抵，不得不以現洋輸出相抵；其積儲於上海者，不過洋商暫時存貯，藉圖投資利益，無異輸出國外之準備；故去年報關出口白銀，共二億六千萬元；而上海洋商銀行存底减二憶二千一百萬元，大津洋商銀行存底减四千一百萬元；此二億六千二百餘萬元，即二三年來全國各地抵付進口之代價，而入於洋商銀行之手。今見有利可圖，並謀資本安全起見，一舉而運至國外。是白銀流出之遠因，仍不能不歸結於連年入超之差額，彰彰明甚矣。</p>
<p>照海關統計：二十一年入超爲八億六千七百萬元，二十二年爲七億三千三百萬元，本年爲四億九千四百萬元；即二十二年减少一億二千四百萬元，二十三年减少二億三千九百萬元。以入超數字言：似見年有差减；無如以人民負據力言：今日四，五億之入超，將重於昔日之十億。况今後外國資本，不易愉入；出口數量，難以驟增；而白銀之保持，又爲全國經濟命脈所關；故進口之限制，出口之增進，有急起直追之必要。以進口方面言：第一農產品中之米，棉，麥三項，在未能自給自足以前，一方應合政府，社會之力，限制消費；一方逐步提高關稅，令其逐年遞减；期以三年或五年，達到自給之標的。本年米，棉，麥三項進口數量爲一億八千七百萬元，幾占入超之一半。第二則一切物質建設，不得不量力而行，此一二年內，宜擇其必要者行之；而不急者置之綏圖。第三則進口商人應合政府，社會之力，設法統制，竭力减少洋貨之購買，研究國貨之代用，至出口方面：第一出口稅宜即時免除。查出　稅前年收入爲　千三百餘萬元，本年爲　千四百餘萬元；若以出口檢查等費用計之，政府　得無幾；而在今日出口競爭劇烈，物價低落之時，政府果能免除出口稅，則無異間接補助；更足以補償中國銀價高漲之弱點。第二則各處檢騐局有刷新之必要，必使檢騐一舉，確實不增加人民負擔，以免人民不得檢騐之益，反增出口品之成本。第三出口品應在產地研究改良品質方法，及運輸，交貨之準確日期。以上數端，果能於短期間實現之，敢信入超數目，必能有顯著之遞减；而白銀問題，應有解决之望！論者謂當此國際收支不能相抵之際，欲求通貨之不收縮，金融雖關之安渡，唯有仰給於外資；或由政府舉借外債；或吸引私人投資，此在各國遇有貨幣困難時，無不存此希望。今以上海一埠之金融問題言：不特與外商利益，休戚相關；且外國銀行之歷史地位，均有相維相扶之責；故外資之吸引，宜不甚難。顧徵之各國實例，外資之供給，往往限於數目，而不能達澈底救濟之效；在金融恐慌之過程中，外人慮貨幣之不安定，外資之吸引，較平時尤難。是以爲中國目前計，必須光具自立自救之決心，庶幾外資援助，固可補救一時；否則亦可以國民自身力量，戰勝難關。所幸中國國民之刻苦生活，著稱於世，果能上下一德一心，省吃儉用，焉知不能有國際收支相抵之一日耶？</p>

<p>（包括資本逃避及華人投機外國股票貨物之損失等）</p>
<p>共　一、五一六、九〇〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>上述數目中，關於華僑匯欵一項，據他方有根據之統計，謂二十二年實有四億元，多於本行是年之佔計，超出半數；此殆因根據匯欵地計數；而其中有轉匯關係，容或有一欵複計所致。抑或本行二十二年報告所列之無法證明來源一項，其數爲二億八千餘萬元，此中卽包納其一部分在內歟？本年華僑滙欵一項，按照本行調查，在二億五千萬元左右。而於支出方面之最難調查者，爲資本逃避之數：因此暫列於無法證明來源項下；但數目不少數，可斷言也。</p>
<p>對外信用</p>
<p>今後中國經濟發展之基礎，固在農村經濟之改善：而開闢交通，增加生產品價格，亦屬急不容緩。我國以往交通事業，多偏重鐵路；建築資金，大半外求。夫以我國幅員之廣，人口之衆，而號稱幹路，猶寥寥無幾。故完成全國鐵路事業，外資之需要，更迫於往昔。然而外資之菜集，一方須視各國金融狀態爲轉移；他方尤在本身信用之提高。所幸年來國內政治，已告安定；鐵路營業，日趨發達，非特本身漸具償還債務之能力，而舊路如粵漢之定期完成；新路如玉萍之開始建築，此在我國鐵道史中，可謂由停滯時期，已轉入進展時期之紀元。今推其致此之故，根本原因，固由於政治之安定；而鐵道當局維持債信之苦心，亦未可盡掩。就二十三年份鐵道債券言之：如北甯路，滬杭甬路及膠濟路，均能依合同規定，償還本息。北甯路計八九，一二五鎊；滬杭甬路計九一，八七五鎊，外補還延付本金三五，五〇〇鎊；膠濟路計利息二，四〇〇，〇〇〇日金；京滬路二十二年份僅付息一次，本年份依合同付息兩次，計一三九，二〇〇鎊；汴洛路二十二年份僅付息一次，未年付息二次，計一，七六二五〇〇法郎；津浦路原借欵及續借欵，二十二已份本息均未償付，本年份原借欵計付息八三，〇〇〇鎊，續借欵計付息三〇，一五六鎊。若本年與去年相較，則本年鐵路債券償還本息總額（經理費在內）計三八九，〇〇八鎊，二，四〇〇，〇〇〇日金，一，七六六，九〇六法郎；二十二年份爲三五〇，八九一鎊，二，四〇〇，〇〇〇日金，五八八，九六八法郎。折合國幣計算，則二十三年份鐵路債券，共付本利八，二九四，九六一元；較二十二年份之七，七五四，六二五元，增加五四〇，三三六元。觀上種種，爲數雖微；即此亦足表示我國鐵路償還債務能力之增進；而倫敦我國鐵路債券市價之高漲，尤爲國際信用提高之反映。茲將二十二年十二月份與二十三年十二月份之倫敦鐵路債券市價，比較如次：</p>
<p>觀上表，二十三年份之鐵路債票市價，均較二十二年份爲上漲；滬杭甬及北甯兩路債票市價，均達平價水準，尤爲空前所未見。此外如財政部經管關鹽兩稅担保之外債，二十三年份償還英德續借欽本息計八二三，一二六鎊，善後借欵本息計一，四九六，〇三八鎊，英法借欵本息計三一八，三六三鎊，外補還延付本金一次，計二五〇，〇〇〇鎊，湖廣借欵利息一四一，四五〇鎊，克利斯浦借欵本息計三三二，二五四鎊，共計三，三六一，二三一鎊，折合國幣計五〇，四一八，四六五元。而最近兩年債票市價高漲之狀况，如下表所示；</p>
<p>一觀倫敦外債市價，不難證明我國雖處國內外經濟恐慌潮流中；而在外債票，深得外國投資者之信用，即此可以了然外人對於富源尚未開發之中國，抱有無限之希望；而在不損國權有利條件之下，利用外資，振興產業，又非不可能也。</p>
<p>二十三年之國際貿易</p>
<p>概論二十三年度進口額爲十億二千九百萬元，出口僅值五億三千五百萬元，合計十五億六千四百萬元；與二十二年度比較，進口减三億一千六百萬元，出口减七千六百萬元，合計减三億九千二百萬元。以民國十五年爲標準則其减退之指數如下：（以十五年份爲一〇〇）</p>
<p>年份　進口　出口　合計</p>
<p>十五年　一〇〇　一〇　一〇〇</p>
<p>二十年　一二七　一〇五　一一八</p>
<p>二十一年　九三　五七　七八</p>
<p>二十二年　七七　四六　六三</p>
<p>二十三年　五九　四〇　五一</p>
<p>進口自二十年之一一七降至五九，出口自一〇五降至四〇，均减去二分之一以上；如與二十二年比較，則進口减百分之二十三，出口减百分之十三，進出口合計，减百分之二十。貿易入超，已自二十年之七億三千三百萬元降至四億九千四百萬；此二億三千九百萬元之減少，一方面固由國民購買力之退縮。，另一方面國貨工業漸形發達，國人漸知採用國貨，頗足引爲樂觀。吾國歷年入超佔進出口貿易總額之百分率如下：</p>
<p>十五年　一三·〇七％</p>
<p>二十年　二二·三六％</p>
<p>二十一年　三六·〇九％</p>
<p>二十二年　三七·五一％</p>
<p>二十三年　三一·五九％</p>
<p>但進一步言之：二十三年進口額指數爲；出口僅四零；是則出口减退程度，與十五年份比較，尚大於進口，其主要原因，不外：</p>
<p>一，自美國實行購銀政策以來，銀價高漲，白銀出口，不下二億八千萬，國內金融，頓形恐慌；工商業深感棘手；銀價高長，對外出口倍形困難。</p>
<p>二，東北特產如大豆，豆餅，豆油等，每年均有二，三億元之輸出，夙爲抵消吾國入超之一部分。而目前此項巨額輸出已不復爲吾所有，已於前年報告中一再言之；歷年來損失如左：</p>
<p>東北出口額及出超額（單位千元）</p>
<p>×一月至六月止　入超數。</p>
<p>二十二年份因東北特產內輸之减退，吾本部對東北之貿易，幸能轉入超而爲出超；無如其於二十二年十一月二十二日起，改訂進口稅則，將吾本部輸往之貨物，如棉花，麵粉，捲烟等，增高關稅；致使本部貨物，銷售困難，輸出額比較上年份减少百分之二十五以上。茲將民國十八年以來中國本部對東北之貿易額，列表如次：</p>
<p>由中國本部輸入東北各地　由東北各地輸人中國本部</p>
<p>十八年　八一，七一三，二三七關兩　九三，〇四二，九五六關兩</p>
<p>十九年　八二，〇八六，九五七關兩　一〇四，四三五，二八〇關兩</p>
<p>二十年　五七，一三三，二二五關兩　一四七，七八一，一二九關兩</p>
<p>廿一年　三五，二二六，〇九七關兩　一〇八，九三五，四一五關兩</p>
<p>廿二年　三五，一六一，二三一關兩　三五，三九一，四六八關兩</p>
<p>廿三年　三六，九一九，五九一關兩　二，一一一，七九九關兩</p>
<p>國輥貿易，二十三年度主要各國對華進口貿易額全部减低，其最甚者爲澳洲。澳洲小麥與麥粉兩項，因吾國市價下落及進口稅增加關係，進口額自八千五百萬元降至一千萬元；對吾國總進口之百分數，自六·三二减至〇·二四。英國亦因鋼鐵，棉布等輸華之减少，貿易額下降三千萬元。香港因吾國實行商品進口之領事簽證，其轉口貨物之原產國，大部已可明瞭；加以自海關增稅復，私運進口者增多；故進口自二十二年之四千八百萬减至二千九百萬。印度，安南均因洋米進口减少，貿易額各减三千萬元。</p>
<p>出口方面，稍有增加者，爲英國，澳洲，安南三處；但增加實數，不過數十萬至百萬元。其他各國，大都較二十二年度减少；最甚者爲香港，計减二千萬元，美國减一千九百萬元；日本减一千四百萬元；法國减一千一百萬元。我國對法貿易，歷來均爲出超；二十三年份因生絲去法激减，遂由出超改爲人超。我國對外貿易出超主要國之法與蘇俄，均已先後改爲入超國。茲將最近吾國與各國貿易指數，列表如左：（以二十一年爲一〇〇）</p>
<p>二十三年度於我國貿易　主要關係者，仍爲美，英，日，分述於左：</p>
<p>美國　二十三年份中美貿易，進口爲二億七千一百七十三萬二千元，出口爲九千四百四十三萬五千元，我國入超達一憶七千七百二十九萬七千元。比較上年度，進口减少百分之九，出口减少百分之十七，入超僅减少百分之四。主要進口商品中，以棉花價值爲最鉅，計五千二百八十八萬元；比較上年份之六千六百五十八萬元，已减去百分之二十。其次爲菸葉，計三千零五十四萬元；比較上年份之二千六百十九萬元，則增加百分之十六。再次爲煤油，自上年之五千一百十三萬元降至二千一百三十四萬元；降落之數，幾達百分之六十之鉅，實爲造成進口總值减退之主要因素。再次爲小麥，計值二千零八十五萬元，而上年度進口之數，僅值八千元；此項大量進口，實因美麥借欵而來。汽車及運貨車之進口，自上年之九百四十四萬元增至一千四百四十五萬元；足徵年來我國公路交通之漸形發達。餘如鋼鐵，機器及工具等，略有增加；麵粉，染料顏料，紙及　材等，則均見减少。主要對美出口商品中，以皮貨價值爲最鉅，計一千八百九十一萬九千元；比較上年份之二千零八十三萬二千元，約减百分之十。次爲桐油，計一千六百二十萬元；比較上年份之二千一百三十五萬元，約减百分之二十四。更次爲綿羊毛，計一千一百十九萬九千元；上年份爲一千一百二十一萬一千元，無甚增減。抽紗及挑花品，計七百十萬元；則比較上年份之六百七十六萬五千元，略見增加。猪鬃爲五百十二萬六千元；比較上年份之四百五十六萬一千元，約增百分之十二。生絲自上年份之一千三百九十五萬一千元，减至三百九十一萬二千元，計减百分之七十二，慘跌最甚。餘如茶葉，芝蔴，毛地毯，棉花等，大部减少。草帽及蛋產品等，則有相當增加。</p>
<p>英國　英國對華貿易。進口方面，年來每况愈下。二十三年份總計爲一億二千四百六十四萬七千元；比校上年度又减低百分之十九。主要進口商品，無不同趨衰减；如棉布自上年之一千九百九十萬元减至一千萬元，計縮减二分之一，鋼鐵自上年之二千七百廿六萬元减至一千六百四十三萬元，計縮减五分之二；呢絨自上年之九百六十八萬元减至七百七十四萬元，計縮减五分之一；硫酸錏肥料自上年之六百八十八萬元减至二百零二萬元，計縮减三分之二以上，衰敗最甚。比較上年增加者，爲紡織機器，自四百四十八萬元增至七百四十一萬元</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>；棉線自一百五十萬元增至一百七十萬元等一二項而已！出口方面，廿三年份為四千九百八十萬元；比較上年度之四千八百七十六萬元，略有百分之二之增加。主要出口商品，以蛋及蛋產品為最鉅，計値一千八百九十四萬元；然比較上年度之二千一百九十萬元，已减退百分之十三。其次為茶葉，計値六百八十五萬元；則比較上年度之三百八十五萬元約增百分之八十。更次為猪鬃，計值三百四十三萬元；比較上年度之二百五十二萬元，亦增百分之三十六。其餘如羊毛，皮貨，桐油，生絲，均較上年减少；豆類，毛地毯等，則略有增加；但物為數十萬元之出入而已！</p>
<p>日本日本向為對華貿易之第一位國家；九一八以後，因國內抵貨動動及東北貿易額消失等關係，進出口貿易，均曾退至第三位。二十三年份因英國貿易額下降之故，進口貿易巳自第三位升至第二位；但比貿易價額，物仍步步下趨，始終未見增加，計進口為一億二千六百八十八萬六千元，比較上年又减低百分之四：出口為八千一百二十三萬二千元，比較上年又减低百分之十五。主要進口商品，仍推棉布價額為最鉅，計値一千五百二十萬元：然與上年度之三千三百二十四萬元比較，已跌落二分之一以上。其次當推魚介海產品，值八百六十三萬元，則比較上年度之五百三十七萬元，增加百分之六十。更次為糖，值八百零二萬九千元；比較上年度之九百七十六萬四千元，巳减少百分之十八。其他如化舉產品及製藥，值七百九十八萬元，比較上年增一百二十四萬元；鋼鐵値七百四十二萬元，比較上年增加一百零四萬；紙值七百十六萬元，比較上年增一百八十七萬；雜類金屬製品値五百八十九萬元，比較上年增四十四萬元。主要對日出口商品，以棉花佔第一位，計値一千二百十四萬元；但巳較上年度减少一千零六十九萬元。火蔴及苧蔴佔第二位，計值七百三一萬元；比較上年度增加三百十九萬元。子仁佔第三位，值七百二十八萬元；此較上年度增加二十四萬元。各項雜糧佔第四位，值七百十二萵元；比較上年度增加一百十二萬元。棉紗佔第五位，値六百三十一萬元；比較上年度减少七百五十一萬元，縮减乃達百分之五十四之鉅。其餘如煤，猪鬃等，則依次下之。</p>
<p>進口貨之分析二十三年度進口貨値，總計為五億二千四百萬金單位，合國幣十億二千九百萵元；比較上年份之六億九千萬金單位，合國幣十三億四千五百萬元，約已减去四分之一。如就通常習慣，將各項進口貨，分為：（一）飲食品；（二）原料及半製品；（三）製造品；及（四）雜貨四大類，而加以觀察，則其增减情形如下：</p>
<p>上表廿三年份與廿二年份比較，除第四類雜貨外，餘均表示减退；其中尤以飲食品及菸草為最甚，計自二億零七百萬金單位减至一億一千六百萬金單位，縮减幾至半數。推原其故，則以主要飲食品如米、麥、麵粉、魚介海產品等之進口，廿三年份均大為衰落所致。製造品類，减退亦甚，計自上年份之三億零三百萬金單位减至二億四千萬金單位，約减百分之二十；足徵國內農村經濟日漸崩潰，人民購買力，愈形疲弱，原料及半製品，自上年份之一億五千二百萬金單位减至一億三千八百萬金單位，其衰落程度，比較尚微。</p>
<p>如以進口之百分比論：則當以製造品類為最大，佔總額百分之四十五；原料及半製品類居其次，佔總額百分之二十六；飲食品及菸草上年份數字，本在原料及半製品之上，茲以慘跌過甚，不得不退居第三位，計佔百分之二十二：雜貨最少，計佔百分之五。如將各進口貨分別觀之，主要商品中，比較上年份增加者，約有下列各項：（單位千元）</p>
<p>貨名　進口額　比較上年增加額　所增百分數</p>
<p>蔴及蔴製品　一一、五〇七　五四九　五·〇</p>
<p>羊毛　五、五三三　三、七一七　二〇四、七</p>
<p>金屬　九八、八一二　一、八七五　一·九</p>
<p>機器及工具　五九、三〇六　一六、一九一　三七·六</p>
<p>汽車及附件　一六、六六八　三、三〇三　二四·七</p>
<p>菸葉　三〇、九五九　四、九二二　一八·九</p>
<p>柴油　二一、二六八　二、三三五　一二·三</p>
<p>我國輕工業，年來逐漸發達，進步類速；故上列各項進口貨中，以機器及工具之增加為最鉅，計增一千六百萬元，羊毛進口之增加，可知吾國毛織工業之漸見抬頭。汽車輸入之增加，實基於各省公路之逐漸拓展，凡此均可為吾人欣慰者也。主要商品中、比較上年份减少者、以飲食品類為最多、製造品及原料等類次之、茲列舉如下、（單位千元、</p>
<p>貨名　進口額　比較上年減少額　所減百分數</p>
<p>米　六五·六八五　八五·一三四　五六·五</p>
<p>小麥　三一·八六九　五四·一七四　六三·八</p>
<p>麵粉　七·〇七五　二〇·七三三　七四·六</p>

<p>紙　三七·二六八　六·五六一　一五·〇</p>
<p>木材　三四·一五二　三·一七七　八·五</p>
<p>煤　一一·一一六　一一·一四九　五〇·一</p>
<p>進口貨中、减少在千萬元以上者、為米、小麥、麵粉、煤油、棉布及煤六項、其中以米為最大、計减七千八百萬元、其次為小麥、計减五千六百萬元、更次為煤油、計减四千八百萬元、由是而下、則棉布减三千一百萬元、麵粉減二千萬元、煤减一千一百萬元、</p>
<p>米因二十二年份國內豐收關係、二三年份上半年市價甚低、洋米難於進口、下半年因各省災情嚴重、糧食收穫大减、市價突龍猛進、上海方面、逐有一部份洋米乘機贛入、然卒因閩。粵等處輸入减少之故、全國總輸入額自一億四千四百萬元减至六千六百萬元、小麥與麵粉二項、因美國貨欵之粉麥業於二十三年年初運完、而貨欵以外之麥麵、則因國外市價高昂、輸入困難、以此進口數字、不免驟形减少、煤油於二十二年份俄油來華傾銷、與英、美煤油商競爭劇烈之時、各有大量輸入、國內積存甚富、因之二十三年份進口大减、其他如棉布又造絲、魚介海產品、糖等等、一方旣因關稅增高、每多私運進口、不入海關統計之內、一方亦因人民購買力薄弱、銷路不盛、遂物有大量之下跌、</p>
<p>出口貨之分析二十三年份我國之出口貿易、仍屬每况愈下、計總值自上年份之六億一千一百萬元、跌至五億三千五百萬元、各項貨物分類觀察、則除雜貨類微見增加外、餘均一致跌落、茲特列表比較如下、</p>
<p>吾國出口各貨，向以原料及半製品為大宗，如生絲。植物由·金屬礦砂·生熟皮貨，花生子仁以及猪鬃·棉紗等，均為吾國之主要出品；是故原斜及半製品之合計，常在出口貿易總額半數以上。近年因生絲國際貿易之慘敗，原料品出口總額，大受影響；因此其價值及百分數，均逐年遞减，計其價值，民國二十一年為四億千萬元，二十二年為三億三千六百萬元，二十三年更降至二億八千四百萬元；其百分數二十一年為五十七％，二十二年為五十五％，二十三年又降為五十三％。</p>
<p>其次為飲食品及菸草類，二十三年份出口額為一億三千八百萬元，佔總出口百分之二十六。與上年份比較，升高尚微。出口製造品，向來為數不多，僅棉布·綢緞及挑　品·花邊等數種輕工業或手工業製品，各有一·二千萬元之貿易額而已，！而二十三年份更見低減，出口額自九千九百元减至七千九百萵元；所佔總出口之百分數，亦工一六·三％減至一四·八％。</p>
<p>如就各出口商品貿易額之增减，而加以觀察，則二十三年份亦屬减少者多而增加者少。下表為二十三年份貿易額增加之主要商品：（單位千元）</p>
<p>出口品　價値　比較上年增加額　所增百分數</p>
<p>猪鬃　一五、一二七　三、四四〇　二九·四</p>
<p>羽毛　五、六一〇　一、一五七　二六·三</p>
<p>牲腸　八、二七二　二、六八三　四八·〇</p>
<p>茶葉　三六、〇九九　一、八八九　五·五</p>
<p>菸葉　七、二六六　二、二〇三　四三·五</p>
<p>煤　六、二八七　一、二〇九　二三·九</p>
<p>火蔴·檾蔴·　蔴　…九、九九九　三、七五一　六〇·〇</p>
<p>礦砂　九、五八〇　三、四三六　五五·九</p>
<p>上列各項商品中，當以蔴類增加三百七十五萬元為最距；其中火蔴·苧蔴二項，大都銷往日本，年約四百餘萬元；二十三年份陡增至七百三十一萬元；而銷往英·法·比等國者，是年亦均有增加。蔴類總輸出，比較上年份增至百分之六十，誠為該項營業罕有之現象。猪鬃對英·日·美等國之輸出，均見增加；尤以對日之增加最速；故其加增之數，亦達三百四十四萬元。吾國特產鎢礦砂，銷美·德等國，為數頗巨。年來價格突飛猛晉，二十三年份出口數量，雖由上年之五萬五千公擔減至四萬七千公擔；但其價値反由三四十八萬元增至六百三十二萬元；因此我國礦砂出口總額，在價値上亦有三百餘萬元之躍進。</p>
<p>茶葉本為吾國出口之大宗商品，二十二年份佔出口之第四位；二十三年份因低級紅茶外銷特暢；尤外英銷為甚；因之紅茶出口數量，工九萬八千公擔增至十四萬九千公擔，價值自九百萬元元增至一千二百萬元；茶磚對我出口，亦見增加；僅綠茶自上年之二千萬元減至一千八百萬元；故茶葉總計額，仍有百分之五。五之增加。當此出口貿易極度不景氣中，生絲，棉紗，蛋及蛋產品等各項商品，均已慘跌；而茶葉貿易反能有相當增進而躍居首位，亦云幸矣！</p>
<p>至於二十三年份貿易減少之主要商品，有如下表：（單位千元）</p>
<p>出口品　價値　比較上年減少額　所減百分數</p>
<p>蛋及蛋產品　三〇·二四四　六·二三六　一七·一</p>
<p>生熟皮貨　二九·一〇八　二·八一二　八·八</p>
<p>雜糧及雜糧粉　一〇·三四八　二·三七一　一八·六</p>
<p>花生油　四·一九一　一·四九〇　二六·二</p>
<p>桐油　二六·二一七　四·〇四四　一三·〇</p>
<p>花生　一二·三七一　五·一〇六　二九·二</p>
<p>紙　五·一一九　九九六　一六·三</p>
<p>棉花　二三·五一九　二四·七二八　五一·二</p>
<p>棉紗　三一·二九四　八·七一三　二一·八</p>
<p>棉布　八·七六七　一〇·七九五　五五·二</p>
<p>綢緞　一九·五〇九　六·六四四　二五·〇</p>
<p>錫（錠及塊）　一四·一七三　六·〇六一　三〇·〇</p>
<p>上列商品中，貿易額縮减一半或一半以上者，為：生絲，計减少二千四百七十萬元；棉花，計减少一千五百萬元；棉布，計减少一千零八十萬元，三項為為千萬元以上之大降落。吾國生絲外貿易之衰敗，大有江河日下之勢；尤以二十三年之减退為特甚；蓋出口量之衰少，與價格之低落，雙管齊落；因此貿易貨値，遂加速下降。茲將最按五年絲價（中等廠經）與生絲出口量，及出口價値，列表如次，以見衰退之一斑：</p>
<p>中等廠經每擔平均價格　出口數量　出口價値</p>
<p>民國十九年　一·四九一元　一五一·四二九擔　一七〇·一〇四千元</p>
<p>二十年　一·三五五　一三六·一八六　一三一·九三二</p>
<p>廿一年　九三七　七八·二一九　五一·三三〇</p>
<p>廿二年　七八五　七七·〇八三　四八·二四七</p>
<p>廿三年　五二六　五四·五三一　二三·五一九</p>
<p>觀上表，可知中等廠經平為價，二十三年份僅及十九年之三分之一，生絲出口數量亦僅及十九年份之三分之一；因此兩重關係，出口價爐，尚不及十九年份之七分之一；而生絲在出口貿易商品中，不得不由第一位而退居第七位矣！生絲貿易之主要國家，為法，美，印度，日本等國；其中以對法，美二國之貿易額為最大。但二十三年份對法，美二國之貿易，均大為跌落；法國由上年份之一千五百五十萬元跌至五百九十萬元，計跌百分之六十二；美國一千三百九十萬元跌至三百九十萬元，計跌百分之七十二。僅白絲對安南之出口，稍見增加，自上年份之一百五十六萵元增至二百五十萬元；但為數不大，終無補於全般生絲貿易之衰頹也。</p>
<p>棉花出口貿易之主要國家，為日本與美國。二十三年份對日出口，自上年之二千二百六十八萬元减至一千二百十四萬元；對美出口，自五百七十五萬元減至一百六十萬元；因之出口總値遂减去半數。我國為一純粹之農業國；而今生絲，棉花等主要農產品出口之衰落，一至於此，可勝浩嘆！</p>
<p>棉布，綢緞，棉紗三項，同吾國主要工業生產品；而出口貿易之衰頹，亦與生絲，棉花等如出一轍。以比例而論：則棉布跌落百分之五十五為最大；而綢緞跌落百分之二十五，棉紗跌落百分之二十二，比例雖不若棉布之甚；然其貿易之無生氣則一也。揆厥原因，可得而述者，約有二端：一為日金滙之繼續下落，以及日本國內紡織廠產品之競爭，使我國棉紗，布匹之銷往日本及朝鮮者，感受絕大之威脅；一為滿洲關稅稅則之修改，使中國本部貨物之運銷該地者，失去　昔之自由。因此種種關係，吾國棉布之輸往日本者，由上年之二百九十餘萬元减至數萬元；輸往朝鮮者，由上年之三百萬元減至六十萬元；輸往關東租借地者，由上年之三百二十萬元减至一百六十萬元。棉紗之輸往日本者，由上年之一千三百八十萬元减至六百三十萬元；輸往朝鮮者，由上年之一千零五十五萬元减至九百萬元。綢緞之輸往關東箐借地者，由上年之六百萬元减至二百萬元。</p>
<p>此外，蛋及蛋產品之輸出。比較上年份减少至六百二十萬元；錫錠塊减少六百萬元；花生减少五百十萬元；桐油减少四百萬元，均為組成出口貿易總額衰退之重要因素。出口貿易之衰退一日不已，則我國工商界之不景氣，亦一日不能恢復；貿易入超抵補無方，則白銀外流終難遏止。今日吾舉國上下莫不皇皇於白銀問題之嚴重；實則白銀問題不過為表面之徵象，其病源仍在出口貿易之未能振作耳！</p>
<h3>二十三年度之農業經濟</h3>
<p>農產收穫與價格</p>
<p>二十三年度之農產收穫，逈不如前年。以最重要之糧食，棉花兩項，假定為二十三年之種植面積相等，則糧食收穫止當去年之百分之八十二棉花止當去年之百分之七十三，但棉花面積，本年較去年增加百分之十以上，是棉花收穫數量，尚不及百分之七十三。是以去年農民所受之痛苦，在大自耕農及地主，受農產低落之影響，以致入不敷出；而生產自給之小自耕農，尚可衣食自足。至本年則因歉收關係，小農幾無以自給；故所受之痛苦，較為普遍。以各地收穫情形分別言之：西北及北方糧食收穫，本年較去年歉收百分之四，五；棉花收穫，西北因夏季太旱，秋季太澇，本年當去年之百分之五十八；北方則本年與去年相同。中部湘，鄂，贛三省，本年遭六十年來未有之旱災，糧食，棉花之收穫，止及去年之半數。此三省向有米穀出口，本年反向外省進米。東部蘇，浙，皖三省，亦見歉收，糧食當前年之百分之七十六；棉花當百分之六十。西南及東南部棉花本非主要出產；糧食收穫，與去年相仿。以全體言之：本年農產收穫，以華南及西南為最豐，與去年相若；華北及西北稍歉；華中最為歉收，不及去年十分之六。據中央農業實騐所佔計：本年每畝收獲，與去年比較，西北察，綏，寗，甘，陝五省糧食收成，比去年少百分之五；棉花少百分之四十二。華北晋，冀，魯，豫四省糧食收成，比去年少百分之六；棉花不見减少。華中湘，鄂，贛三省糧食收成，比去年少百分之五十；棉花少百分之四十七。華東蘇，浙，皖三省糧食收成，比去年少百分之三十四；棉花少百分之四十一。西南川，雲，貴三省糧食收成，比去年少百分之二。東南閩，粵，兩省糧食收成，比去年少百分之十八。</p>
<p>農產價格，以上海市價為標準，互有漲落。最漲者為米。最跌者為絲。米價之漲，由於歉收，蘇米平均漲百分之四十九；湘米漲百分之三十九。湘米品質，較近洋米，本年仰光米所漲無幾，西貢米反見跌價；因之源源進口。湘米受其影響；故價漲較微。麥價比去年漲百分之九；不外由於中國小麥歉收。棉花價格，其代表中國棉之標花，本年下半年價格，與去年無甚上下；而與美棉競銷之靈寳花，則較去年漲百分之十一；此由美國减少棉產，通貨膨脹，美棉價格抬高；故震寳棉亦隨之而漲。絲價則以國外銷路日滯，價格日落，如在紐約之中國絲價，降落百分之二十六；在里昂降落百分之三十七；故在上海之絲價，平均跌落百分之三十七。茶葉亦跌百分之十二。</p>
<p>米，棉，麥之進口</p>
<p>二十三年度農產品之進口，達三億三千四百餘萬元；其中米占六千五百六十餘萬元；棉花占九千萬元：麥占三千一百八十餘萬元；共一億八千七百餘萬元，約占十分之六。此三者果能自給，則中國之入超，可去其半。米之進口數：</p>
<p>數量（公担）　金額（國幣）</p>
<p>二十一年度　一三，五九九，六九二　一八五，七六四，九〇六</p>
<p>二十二年度　一二，九五三，九九八　一五〇，八一九，一〇九</p>
<p>二十三年度　七，七一〇，六一〇　六五，六八四，六七八</p>
<p>以數量言：二十二年减少百分之四·七五；二十三年减少百分之四〇·四八；米進口稅之徵收，為進口减少之重要原因。查米進口之區別為閩，粵一省：廣東省進口為五百零三萬担；福建為一百零七萬担；上海為六十萬担；寗波為五十二萬祖；天津占三十五萬担。據金陵大學統計：江蘇產米四千三百五十萬担；浙江為四千三百五十四萬擔。茲二者，果能於農田水利稍稍注意，則上海與寗波二地之一百十萬擔，不難自給。閩·粵二省，不足較巨；但皖·湘·贛三省若非歉收之年，果能運輸便利，運費减輕，雜稅免除，未嘗不能供給大半。但同時米之集中於便利地點，及儲藏方法之改善，均宜有改進之必要。棉花進口數：</p>

<p>二十一年度　二，二四五，四九八　一八六，七八二，九九七</p>
<p>二十二年度　一，二〇六，〇六七　九八，二六，〇七一</p>
<p>二十三年度　一，一六三，二二三　九〇，二四六，五九八</p>
<p>是本年進口數量，較之前年，减去大半。若不加入政府借欵美棉，其減數當較此為多。近來各處植棉面積，逐漸增加；美毬推廣，漸見成效；凡植棉省份，若能如魯·陝兩省之積極進行，四·五年間，焉知不能自給？而中國組絨棉花，向有三·四千萬元之出口，若能急起直追，何嘗不可變入超為出超耶？麥之進口數：</p>

<p>二十二年度　一〇，七一四，六三四　八八，〇四三，二九五</p>
<p>二十三年度　四，六四九，一四九　三一，八六九，一七一</p>
<p>是二十三年進口數量，减低在半數以上，其原因由於徵牧進口稅，與米相若。其需要最大之處，為上海一埠，占四百零八萬擔；次為南京，占三十二萬擔，天津九萬擔擔；再次為靑島，鎭江兩處，均約七萬七千餘擔。照本年度减少數量之鉅，可知中國產麥數量，未必不可自給；祇以運輸不便，品質低次；因之價格與成色，不能與洋麥相敵，廠家遂樂用洋麥六更以製造頭號粉之關係，不能不用洋麥；實則並非必須輸入之品。</p>
<p>照上述情形言之之：米，棉，麥三者，並北不可自給；且有急速自給之可能；而始終年有鉅額之進口，實由政府與人民之忽視。今白銀問題日見緊迫，米，棉，麥之目給，有裨於國際收支者，非淺鮮焉！</p>
<p>農業建設</p>
<p>吾人認定農村衰敗之原因，在農民之經營成本大，而收得之價格小。救濟之道，一面須减輕經營成本；一面須提高農產價格。一年以來，各方面對於此種工作之進行，曾有不少之努力；其成績較著者，列舉如下：</p>
<p>一，水利建設防治水旱災之農業水利，對於减輕農業威本，及增加農業生產，自有極大之影響。近一年來，在經濟委員會管理之下，長江·黃河·漢水·淮水·贛江等大河道，兩岸或修補隄防，或建築涵洞；將來防七水災上，當右偉、之效果。</p>
<p>西北各省之防旱水利，亦有顯著之進步，如陝西之涇惠渠·洛　渠·溜惠渠；綏遠之民生渠；寗夏之雲亭渠；甘肅之紅古城渠，達家川渠等，或已測量；或已修築。江蘇有導淮入海及新運河之開濬。此等工程完成之後，農產收獲，可大為增加。</p>
<p>二，農業金融之流通農村缺乏資金，已為近年啊遍之現象；高利貸之壓迫，亦為農業成本過大之原因。近一年來，政府及金融機關以低利對農民之放欵，估計有一千蝕萬元，較二十二年約增加一倍。此神放欵，不但直接减輕農業之成本；並且間接影響農村經濟及農民生活之改善。即以本行直接放欵之農村而論：放欵一年之後，已有下列影響：（一）肥料·牲寄·種籽·農具等之設備，較為充實；每畝之產額，因而增加。（二）小麥·棉花·家畜等之改良種籽，得以利用；農產因而改良。（三）合作社以借欵放欵之盈餘，舉辦民衆學校，合作講習；農民少敎育，因而提高。此皆農村放欵之直接影響。其他如鎮市繁榮，農產價格平穩，地價上漲，農民組織進步，農民心理向上等間接之影響，均有足道者。</p>
<p>三，農民經濟組織之猛進農村合作之組織　本不專為借欵；然有欵司借之時，農民易於組織。據中央農業實騐所最近公佈統計：合作社在二十三年以前設立者計五千三百三十五社，二十三年內增設者計九千三百一十四社，一年間增加，幾至兩倍。在二十三年底共有合作社一萬四千六百四十九社。合作社社員人數，在二十三年以前計有十八萬五千餘人，二十三年內增加三十七萬三千餘人，一年間之增加，超過以前之兩倍。截至二十三年底共有社員五十五萬八千餘人。此種農民，是否明瞭合作眞義？能否處理社務得法？姑且不論；但有此組織之農村，生活向上，及經濟改良之機會，巳較前增加；若假以時日，加以訓練，社員團體行動之習慣，不難養成；其生產及買賣之力重，亦隨之增高。</p>
<p>四，此外政府方面，對於農事之改良，農產之統制，人才之訓練，亦漸由宣傳而進於計劃實行。學術機關方面，對於農產改良，災害防治，農民敎育，農民組綠等問題，亦漸能以研究試驗之心得，進而作推廣全國之實騐。凡此種種，其成績之價値，雖不能一時估定；然其將來效果之偉大，可斷言也。</p>
<p>顧不能已於言者，農業建設之中，有足注意者數端：（一）鄉村治安：治安不善之區域，不但城市剩餘之資本，不能盡輔助農業生產之責；即繫於土地之農民，亦難安心耕作，此為妨害農村建設之最大阻力。故改進長民保衛之組織，為農業建設之第一條件；（二）農村人才：農村建設事業，無論技術方面，組織方面，非有意志堅强，學識專長，而又能與農民同甘苦之適當人才，不能舉辦。此種人才，在國內現時之普通學校出身者，不盡合用。此後造就適合我國農村需要人才，為農業建設之第二條件；（三）方財政：農業建設之資本，固可由金融機關或私人資金供給；但舉辦建設之經費，非由地方籌措不可。吾人不望政府减輕若干之稅捐，致使地方之一般行政不能敏活進行；但現行稅捐，取之於民者，必多直接用之於民；此為農業建設之第三條件。</p>
<p>有穩足之治安；有專門之人才；又有充分之經費；城市游資，不難流入鄉村；農業建設之成功，可期而待。是則有賴於地方當局與社會民衆之共同努力也！</p>
<p>二十三年之工業</p>
<p>二十三年國內工業之變態，更形尖銳化。各業創設之初，皆在通商口岸：良以大都市勞工供給便利，金融週轉活，原動力價格不高，治安亦比較安定。但近來則內地治安已有進步，交通亦漸改良，勞工糾紛較少；加以內地於原料及消費市場，均較接近，形成內向發展之趣勢；在過去一年，巳見端倪。至全體工業，就區域言之：口岸工廠，多感困難；內地工廠，較為寬裕。就規模言之：大工業虧多盈少；小工業尚能支持。就經營言之；計劃周密，開支節省者，均獲盈餘；管理鬆懈，預算龐大者，難免虧折。各業雖各有其興衰之原因；而上列種種，實其共同原因。茲擇主要諸業，分述於後：</p>
<p>棉紡織業　二十三年份，華廠紗錠增一〇五·三四枚；綫錠增七·一八一枚；布機增一·八四五台。日廠紗錠增一二·七三八枚；綫錠均二一·九九二枚；布機增一·四二五台。英廠紗錠增一·七一二枚；綫錠增二·七二〇枚。總計共增一五一·六八三枚。二十二年與二十三年相較，紗錠以華廠之增率為大；棧錠則以洋商各廠為多；因洋商各廠增紡細紗綫；而國人經營各廠，仍以粗紗為主要出品。本年度紗錠昨增十五萬餘枚；惟紗綫產量共計二·二七二·八三四包，較去年反减五九·八五〇包；其中華廠减少四萬五千餘包，洋廠减少無幾。至於棉布產量，計二三·四六五·四三七疋，較去年增三·三四三·五三七疋：其中日廠增加三·八六一·一四三疋，華廠减少五〇八·〇八八疋；此足表現洋商各廠趨重於自紡自織也。本年紗價之衰落，實所罕見；標紗市價與去年較，平均跌十三元二角；與前年較，則跌四十三元五角；而棉花成本，每担平均價計四十三元七角五分，較去年增一角二分；此花貴紗賤之現象，致令資本較弱之廠，無法維持。上半年全國開工錠數，計四·六七八·二七二枚；停工錠數，計一·二一四·二六七枚。再查各廠存紗，幾達近年之最高額；即以上海市場而論，本年二月底計一六五·七〇四包，較去年同月多三二·六三六包；三月底計一六七·一五〇包，較前年同月多七·六二三包。其後一面紗銷漸暢；一面縮减生產；因之存紗漸少，至十一月底，尚存七一·七一七包。要之：本年度實為紗廠業最艱苦之年；而洋商紗廠成本輕於華商紗廠，更使華商紗廠難於立足。顧同時華商紗廠之紗錠布機，仍年有增加，尤見國九奮鬥圖存，不遺蝕力也。</p>
<p>繅絲　業近數年來，我國生絲出口銳减，本年度匪特未見轉機；抑且衰落更甚。二十二年底江，浙，兩省所有一百八十餘家絲廠，繅絲車頭四萬餘部，大半停頓。今年夏，絲價略高，原料尚賤，開工者始見增加但多數仍存觀望，靜待時機。上海一百零八廠，不過二十三家開車；無錫五十廠，開車者僅有三十三家；浙江全省，祇十六廠開工；且復多臨時集資租廠　繅性質，時作時　；而四川，山東，廣東各絲廠，亦復衰敝異常。四川絲廠，分鐵機與木機兩種：二十二年鐵機絲廠尚餘十九家，二十三年上期尚存十一家，年底則全停頓矣！木機絲廠規模較，小大都散於農家，無從統計。山東絲廠，亦有鐵機，木機之分：惟鐵機絲廠寥寥無幾；木機則散佈四鄉，皆係家庭工業；經該省建設廳勸導農民組織製絲合作社，改良技術後，巳較前進步。至於廣東絲廠，去年開工者，僅五十餘家，較諸全盛時期减少三分之二。惟因生絲市場，向在歐美；人造絲之競爭，與去世界不景氣，皆足减少生絲之銷路；目日滙步跌，有利日絲之推銷，更令華絲無法競爭。全年我國生絲出口數量，約三萬三千担，較去歲减少百分之二八。但我國工資廉，威本輕；倘能選擇良佈，改善品質，製造進步，推銷得法，未嘗不可復興也。</p>
<p>麺粉業　本年全國國人經營之麺粉廠，除東北四省不計外，共有八十九處；其中江蘇，浙江，安徽三省占三十六處；山東，河南二省占二十五處；湖南，湖北，江西三省占力處；河北，山西，察哈爾，綏遠四省占十九處。全年機製麥粉產量，約計二七·六〇〇·〇〇〇袋，較之去年增加百分之八。至本年銷售數量，約計三三·五〇〇·〇〇〇袋，較之去年亦减少百分之八。同時本年進口麺粉，計五九五·七四八公担，較之去年减少百分之七十。在本年上半年中，粉價殊形低落；最低時每包僅一元九角三分；而原料供給，因新　不接，小麥市價並未隨粉價下降；各廠營業，均極不振。惟六月以後，江南苦　，人心不安，內地囤戶，紛紛吸收現貨，投機者復乘機而起；致上海積貨三·五〇〇·〇〇〇包，一月之內，即經出淸。加以平瀋通車成立，麺粉可以出關；致粉價每包漲至二元以上；八月底竞提高至每包二元九角。惜九，十月間，逐步跌落；致年終各粉廠大都歇工，其中自不免　虧累者；惟獲盈餘者亦非少數。查製造麺粉原料之小麥，向多仰仗進口；而本年吾國小麥產區，如河北，山東，河南等省，又均屬歉收，全國產額，總計較去年减少；致內地各廠原料成本，不能不囚之增加。今後誠能有充分之國麥供給，則成本尚可减輕。麺粉一業；不難維持常態也。</p>
<p>捲烟業　全國七十餘捲烟廠，大半設於上海；茲就滬地華商加入捲烟業同業公會之四十六家言之；二十三年度全體營業，以價值論：約僅二十二年之七成；以銷路數量論。則則與去年不相上下。華商全體銷額四十餘萬箱；外商銷路則大减。據佔計：去年全國中外各廠合計營業額達二萬萬元，華廠約佔十分之六。華廠所以能興外商競爭者；蓋因國民經濟困難，購買力弱，以前喜吸上等洋貨香烟者，紛紛以較　之國貨香烟代替之；且華商烟廠更能减低售價，加送贈品，竭力宣傳，薄利多質；故能稍獲盈餘。</p>
<p>火柴業　自二十年火柴關稅稅率增高，羣以有利可圖，競設新廠，產量突增。產銷無法平然，市價目日漸低落。著以統稅區域佔計，本年度蘇，浙，皖區國人經營之十九廠，產一九四，〇〇〇箱；銷一九五，〇〇〇。魯，豫區三十五廠，商二七一，〇</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>〇〇箱，銷二七二，〇〇〇箱。冀，晋，察，綏區十廠，產一三一，〇〇〇箱；銷一五四，〇〇〇箱。湘，鄂，贛區三廠，產三四，〇〇〇箱。銷三四，〇〇〇箱。并計產六三〇，〇〇〇箱；銷六五五，〇〇〇箱。產銷相差數額，乃以去歲存貨補充。　　　在華開工之火柴廠，共有六家，本年產八五，八〇〇箱；銷七三，五〇〇箱。若將兩年情形比較，本年度華廠產額雖增百分之一〇；而銷額却减百分之八。外廠產量减百分之二五；銷路减百分之四〇。至於市價，每箱下跌七元至十元不等。各廠營業旣遭虧損，實雖繼續開工，全年停工者有十三家；短期停工者有三十餘家。近雖有同業合作之組織；但至今未見顯著效果。</p>
<p>水泥業　自民國十一年至二十一年，我國進口水泥，數量上，金額上均係歷年遞增，計民國十一年進口為四，三五五擔，二十一年到達三，六七〇，二〇一擔：惟至二十二年則降為二，二七八，七〇一擔；本年則减少益鉅，計一，三〇三，〇三八擔。輸入國家，多屬鄰境，如安南，香港，日本，澳門等處，以距離不遠，運輸方便之故。查國人所營水泥工廠，共有七處，每年可能產量，計四，十三〇，〇〇〇桶；實際產量，大約不過四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇桶。全國各廠實際產量，雖乏整個統計；惟就華北，華中及華南等地之四大廠產量而論：尚年有增加，民國二十一年計二，五七〇，〇〇〇桶；二十二年計二，六四〇，〇〇〇桶；本年計二，九一〇，〇〇〇桶。至於出口水泥，則年見减少，民國二十年計四〇〇，〇〇〇擔；二十一年降為三六，〇〇〇擔；二十二更减為一八，〇〇〇擔；本年則僅六，七五〇擔。年來國內百度建設，水泥之需要日增；近因剿匪軍事勝利，內地市場漸廣；且本年自新稅則頒行後，進口水泥，巳顯見减少。雖國人所營水泥工業，並未呈突飛猛進之現象；然以吾國幅員之廣，人口之衆；市區建設之繁，新興工廠及橋梁，道路營造之日增；則現下國人經縈各廠之產量，自不足以資應付；是則水泥工業之前途，當尚有長足發展之餘地。</p>
<p>糖業　近數年來洋糖進口，年見减少，由民國十八年之一四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇擔，降而為二十二年之四，二〇〇，〇〇〇擔。本年輸入，亦不過四，’一〇〇，〇〇〇擔；其中上海一璋進口者，約佔四分之一。輸入來源，首推爪哇；次為香港及日本等處。至於進口减少，當不外關稅增高，私運增加；內地購貿能力低萍；及土糖產量增多之故。查本年國內之製糖工業，並無顯著之進展；而國人經營之各廠，仍依舊停工。憔產蔗各省，則紛紛籌立新式糖廠，截至本年底止，廣東省營糖廠已成立三處，預計來春可以陸續出貨；四川，廣西，江西，福建四省，亦正鳩工設計，各擬成立糖廠一處。果能銳意進行，注重成本，則糖業之復與，為期不遠矣！</p>
<p>基本化學業　酸，鹼兩類之進口，年來互有增减，二十一年酸類輸入一一七，〇〇〇擔，鹼類八三三，〇〇〇擔；二十二年酸類輸入一五四，〇〇〇擔，鹼類八五九，〇〇〇擔；本年酸類輸入一三七，〇〇〇擔，鹼類九六五，〇〇〇擔。輸入國家，酸類以日本為首，鹼類則推英國第一。至於氮氣工業品，每年輸入之總價值，當在四千萵元以上；即以硫酸铔肥料一項而論：二十一年輸入一，八六五，〇〇〇擄；二十二年一，六七四，〇〇〇擔……本年八二六，〇〇〇擔。惟年來國人認為此項化舉工業之基本原料，實有設廠自給之必要；因之酸，鹼，氮氣等廠，自民國十六年以來，恒年有增加；截至本年底止，國人經營之酸廠計六處；鹼廠計七處；氮氣廠計二處。至氮氣廠雖均在建造之中，預計二十四年秋季當可陸續出貨。二十二年中，酸廠計產硫，鹽，硝三酸共二四三，〇〇〇擔，較之進口酸類，幾及兩倍。本年酸廠產額，雖街無整個統計；惟進口三酸，則較去年减少一八，二一三擄；此蓋由於外人或欲以是國防產品，留以自給：同時亦由於國人對於酸類製造之努力邁進耳！至於齡類，則二十二年中計產純鹼，燒鹼，泡化鹼，硫化鹼等共八一九，〇〇〇擔，恰與進口鹼類數量相當；本年產量，不下九〇〇，〇〇〇擔，與進口數目相等，其中純鹼一項，且轉有輸出；是則不得不歸功於各鹼廠之發奮進取也。酸，鹼兩業過去之成績，旣均良好；則來日之進展，自屬方興未艾。而新興氮氣工業之經營奢，又原屬此兩業之中堅，其前途之光輝，當可預卜。</p>
<p>總觀　般工業狀况，雖有外貨競爭；庸絕對悲觀。如工廠本身能逐步改善，處處精計成本，减少　費；同時外界給予相當援助；俾得週轉靈活；國家工業政策，亦得樹立維護基礎。以我國物產之富，人口之衆棉工業之廉，祇求自產自銷；目下工廠出品，想尚不足供給國內市導耳！</p>
<h3>二十三年度之業務工作</h3>
<p>二十三年度之業務方針，仍本年來增加人民生產，恢復內地繁榮之精神；按照本行自身能力，逐步進展。不意下半年白銀問題發生，不能不相當戒備，以維持金融之安定。但不敢收縮放欵，以免工商業之困難。進退伸縮之間，如何而謂為得當？實為金融業者　最難解决之點也。</p>
<h3>業務工作</h3>
<p>（一）工業放欵二十三年上期承去歲疲憊之餘，國內工業，未見復蘇；下期銀價高漲，外貨湧進；致一般工廠出品，不得不隨之跌價競爭。各廠家巳漸覺悟欲求生存，非本身緊縮開支，減輕成本，改良品質不為功。本行一方盡調劑之責：一方勸導工廠本身之改善。而放欵方式，不得不注重其擔保品之性質，須活動而易於流通者；俾投入資金，得有相當的保障，及迅速的週轉。二十三年本行工業放疑餘額，為五千四百五十工萬三千六百九十三元，較去年增加一千二百一十一萬八千二百二十五元。其中有押者佔四千七百一十五萬五千六百四十三克，即百分之八六·四一；無押者佔七百四十一萬八千零五十元，即百分之一三·五九。如以性質分別：定期佔百分之二九·五；活期佔百分之七〇·五。各業所佔成分，其百分率如下：</p>

<p>建築材料業　〇·三九　碾米業　〇·二三</p>
<p>橡膠業　〇·二一　應用化學業　〇·一八</p>
<p>其他工業　〇·八五</p>
<p>工業小額放欵　我國小工業，多由手工業之演進；其管理易，開支省，成本輕，存貨少，雖值此不景氣，尚可勉强支持。惟其流動資金缺乏，不得不以高利向外借貸，常年辛苦，僅足付息。本行今年在滬試辦工業小額放欵，每戶大者二千元，小奢三百元，利率較低。該項年終餘額，共計六萬八千餘元。試辦以來，小工業頗稱便利；且多能顧全信用，到期償還；總結時，其延期，轉期者，不過佔全數百分之十二。</p>
<p>（二）業放欵本年之農業放欵，可分三類：（一）農產品押欵；（一）農民小額押欵；</p>
<p>（三）農村合作社放欵。</p>
<p>（甲）農產品押欵本年利用本行五百零九處倉應之設備，儘量抵做農產品押欵，以謀穩定物價之初步救濟。本年下期，共做七千六百餘萬元。其中糧食押欵佔一千七百二十四萬餘元；棉，絲等押欵占五千九百餘萬元，押戶共計一萬六千餘戶。</p>
<p>（乙）農民小額押欵　距離鄕村較按之物產倉庫，本年亦儘量抵做農民小額押欵，以　鄕村金融之流通。截至二十三年底，共做押欵一百一十二萬五千餘元。押戶</p>
<p>九千餘戶，每戶平均押欵一百一十餘元。</p>
<p>（內）農村合作社放欵　農村合作社放欵　不但以低利供給農民生產之資本；且賴放欵關係，推動農民之經濟組織，農事改進，及生活改良。本行試做此種放欵，已有三年；惟在本年度內，試做之範圍，稍加擴充；截至二下三年底，計放欵一百九十七萬餘元；內到期陸續收回者，計一百三十三萬餘元；其餘俟明春到期，均可望完全收清。與本行發生借貸關係之合作社，共計九百四十四社，社員五萬二千七晨六十餘人，分佈於六省四十縣。</p>
<p>（三）增設內地機關本行為提倡土產輸出，便利客商辦貨起見，今年又在內地士產集散之區，添設分枝多處：計江蘇，安徽省內各四處；湖南，山東省內各一處；河南省內三處；湖北，江西，浙江，廣東省內各兩處；河北省內六處；連同上海市內增設一處，共二十八處。更因內地水陸交通之改進；以致商務狀况，隨之變遷；本行因時制宜，將原有　關機關，移置渭南；並將江蘇省之窰灣，東三省之通化，洮南，新立屯，四不街，泰安鎮各機關裁撤。現計有分枝機關共二百零三處。</p>
<p>（四）協助國貨運銷二十三年中國本部進口總值十億零二千九百餘萬元，工業品約佔百分之四十八；其中一部份國內尚無此類製告工廠。至於國內工廠能製造之出品，約佔百分之十七，價值一億七千九百餘萬元。倘國貨產·運·銷均能改善，價廉物美，社會樂用，未曾不是減少入超之一途。年初本行聯絡國貨工廠，共同組織國貨聯辦處，擔任採辦；國貨聯運處，辦理運輸，並在適宜都市，提倡設立國貨公司，結至年終，先後已成立之公司，計有上海，鎮江，嘉興，溫州，福州，長沙，鄭州七處，重慶國貨介紹所一處。總計每日營業收入，平均在兩萬元左右；全年估計，當在七百萬元以上。對於國內工業品之推銷，不無小補。</p>
<p>（五）試辦通信購貨匯欵，各大書店·商號·工廠，多有在各埠設立分店或批發處直接營業者；但因分枝未能普遍，客商購貨，常感不便。本行為提倡通信購貨辦法，會與各大書店，商號，工廠訂立契約，利用本行二百餘處分枝，代辦購貨；其手續簡單，匯水低廉；間有免收滙水者。現已訂約廠號，共有八家。此種辦法，委託字號旣得推廣貨物銷路，逮地顧客亦可向外埠廉價購貨；本行居間為工商界効ｇ　臂之助，舊以增進匯欵業務。由上海先行試辦以來，各方均感便利。</p>
<p>（六）粵漢路與玉南路建築資金之承受，建築粵漢路之倡議，遠在前淸光緒二十二年；幾經波折，廣韶段始於光緒三十二年開工，民國五年完成；武長段民國元年動土，七年在長沙與湘路接軌，通車至株州後。經費用　；致株州至韶州一段計長四五一公里無法繼續，直至二十二年鐵道部與中英庚欵董事會商借，指撥鐵道部部份之未到期退還庚欵，作為基金，發行公債。本行會同中央，交通與滙豐磋商，承受發行公債，費一年之久，始於一十三年六月一日發行公債總額一·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，年息六厘，自二十四年一月一日開始還本，至三十六年一月一日本息全數還淸；從此粵漢路建築經費有着，而停工十七年之南北幹綫，不久有完成之望。將此南北溝通，於政治經濟前途，裨益非淺。又玉南段經費之籌劃，去歲報告書中，已略為敘述。本年初，本行受鐵道部及浙。贛兩省政府之委託，與德國與脫華爾夫公司交涉投資方式。磋商結果，由德公司墊借材料欵項合國幣八百萬元，一切手續，完全委托本行辦理；對於鐵路行政及技術事項，並不直接參加。再由本行聯合金城·上海·浙江興業·新華·江西裕民·郵政儲金匯業總局組織銀團，承借現欵八百萬元，作為該路建築費用；一面由央及兩省政府合組浙贛鐵路公司，將最高管理及監督權交與中央及地方政府與銀團共同組織之理事會執行之。該路自二十三年七月開工以來，進展甚速，預計二十四年底即可通車。此路為我國中部之東西幹綫，其價值當不亞於隴海鐵路也。</p>
<p>（七）彰廣支行鈔票存欵之整理，本行前廣州支行於民國十二年受政變影響停業，所有前廣東官廳積欠該支行欵項，疊向交涉，迄無價還辦法；致令該支行對於所發鈔票，以及各項存欵，亦無法整理。但本行為願全行信起見，特於本年春間將前發，鈔票及存欵，從事整理，現已將告結束。社會公衆對於本行之力顧信用，均表滿意。</p>
<p>（八）上海行屋之改建查上海分行外灘仁記路行屋，原先係德國總會舊址，並非適用於銀行業之建築。自經民國十七年總管理處由平遷滬後，辦公地位，更形偪仄。本行為節省起見，因陋就簡，亦旣數戰。嗣以該廈歷年過久，墻址走動，屋頂分裂，不得不另覓營業處所，以策安全。翻造新廈，勢無可綏；爰去年起先將漢口路五十號貨出房屋，逐漸收回，略加修茸。總管理處。國外部·信託部·上海分行及保險公司，均可於二十四年春間先後遷入。至新廈建築，一秉本行向來來穩健之宗旨，審酌辦理。雖以觀瞻所敷；尤必須估計成本。切合本身實用；不徒矜尚榆奐。大約建造十層上下，當可合用；尚在縝密設計中也。</p>
<h3>中國銀行民國二十三年度之營業</h3>
<p>本年度上半年資金過剩，本行雖减低存欵利率；而存欵之增加如故，苦無穩當利潤之途。下半年則白銀問題發生，銀根頓時緊縮，各方資金之需要，幾苦無以應付。故二十三年度營業之困難，為向來所未見。本行本歷來固有之方針，當資金過剩，市面寬鬆之日，懷然於循環之必至，不敢不審眞從事，寗忍虧耗；及市面緊迫，則權衡輕重，維持常度，盡本行應盡之責。顧本行可盡之能力，及外界之需要，豈能常相呼應？而輕重緩急之間，各有不同之主觀；此金融界之不能見諒於事業界，而本行所虛之地位之不能盡愜人意，蓋勢所必至；即歐美之金融界，亦焉能免於此乎？顧國民經濟之生存與救濟，在乎金融界與專業界及政府與社會之澈底合作，英國不景氣之恢復，此其先例。本行願本銀行與社會一體之精神，為今後營業之方針也。</p>
<p>（甲）業務概況</p>
<p>（一）存欵</p>
<p>甲，存欵總額二十三年度各項存欵總餘額為五四六·六九三·九〇二·五九，較二十二年度計增加七·四〇九·三七五·四三。分析比較，則：（一）活期存欵餘額為一八二·八五六·〇三七·一九·較二十二年度减少六。九一三·〇五三·四九；（二）定期存欵餘額為二五一·八八四三三三·五八·校二十二年度增加四〇·六八三·四八四·三五；（三）同業存欵餘額為一一一·九五三·五三一·八二·較二十二年度减少二六·三六一·〇五五·四三。</p>
<p>就上述定期及活期存欵增减情形，略可以覘一十三年市面蕭條，利殖困難之趨勢。存戶寗願寄託大部分資金於比較穩固之途；而不敢投資事業。至同業存額之大减，表示二十三年歲末市面之緊澀。茲併列二十二·二十三兩年度本行定期存欵與活期存欵兩項之百分率，比較於次：</p>
<p>二十二年度　二十三年度</p>
<p>活期存欵　四七·三三　四二·〇五</p>
<p>定期存欵　五二·六七　五七·九五</p>
<p>乙，存戶數目　二十三年度存戶數目為一七〇·二〇〇戶，較二十二年度之一三六·七二九戶，又增三三·四七一戶。</p>
<p>丙，存欵性質二十三年度各項存欵，依照存戶區分，與二十二年度比較，其百分率如左：</p>
<p>二十二年度　二十三年度</p>
<p>個人及團體存欵　五〇·二〇　六二·八八</p>
<p>工商業存欵　四五·六六　三一·三四</p>
<p>機關存欵　四·一四　五·七八</p>
<p>（二）放欵</p>
<p>甲，放欵總額二十三年各項放欵總餘額為四四一·九五二·一七五·〇一·較二十二年度計增加六〇·五六三·五六五·八六。分析比較，則：（一）活期放欵及透支餘額為一八四。一八七·四三五·四九·較二十二年度增加五八·三四二·八五八·九五；（二）定期放欵額為一九七·七六一·一一六·七七·較二十二年度增加八·六二二·四二六·一九；（三）現及買進期票餘額為三〇·〇〇三·六二二·七五·較二十二年度減少六·四〇一·七一九·二八。</p>
<p>本年度放欵季節，本行應各地市面枯澀之需要，不得不酌量增加放欵數量，平均約較二十二年度增加百分之十五；更為力求資金靈活，效率增宏起見，略偏重於貸放活期及透支欵項；是以定期放欵較二十二年度增百分之四·五，而活期放欵及透支則較二十二年度增百分之四六·三。</p>
<p>又本年度對於直接收受內地土產期票，仍奮力倡導，以圖事實上補助物產之運銷。在十一月中旬，運用於期票及押匯匯票之欵，最高餘額達四千零八十萬元。</p>
<p>乙，放欵性質二十三年度各項放欵，依運用性質分析，與二十二年度比較，其百分率如左：</p>
<p>二十二年度　二二三年度</p>
<p>商業　二七·〇二　二九·七七</p>
<p>工業　一二·〇八　一三·二五</p>
<p>農業及農產品　四·八一　五·三八</p>
<p>公用事業　〇·九七　一·〇八</p>
<p>交通事業　一·四一　二·一五</p>
<p>二十二年度　二十三年度</p>
<p>同業　六·五六　二·一五</p>
<p>機關　四三·九〇　四一·九一</p>
<p>團體　〇·七三　一·〇八</p>
<p>個人　二·五二　三·二三</p>
<p>合計一〇〇·〇〇　一〇〇·〇〇</p>
<p>（三）匯欵</p>
<p>甲，全年經匯總額二十三年度本行全年經收匯欵總額為八三四·二三三·〇〇〇元，</p>
<p>較之二十二年度增加七九·五一二·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>乙，經滙區域本年度經匯匯欵、，按照國內各區域分析，觀察其消長情形，茲將二十二，二十三兩年度之百分率比較於次：</p>
<p>區域　二十二年度　二十三年度</p>
<p>長江流域　五九·三　六三·一</p>
<p>華北　一七·七　一五·六</p>
<p>東三省　一〇·〇　八·七</p>
<p>華南　一三·〇　一二·六</p>
<p>丙，口岸之匯入及滙出二十二年度報告中，曾略述反由本行匯欵測證現金集中口岸之趨向，本年度其勢似仍未少戢：不過冬季內地缺現，欵項調轉，多數携運現金，有不經出匯欵手續者。茲將二十三年度本行匯欵，依口岸及內地分析，其匯出匯入之百分率如左：</p>
<p>口岸匯出　三二·九一　內地匯出　六七·〇九</p>
<p>口岸匯入　七二·九一　內地匯入　二七·〇九</p>
<p>（四）國外滙兌</p>
<p>二十三年度國外匯兌業務，較之二十二年度頗有顯著進展。二十二年度之國外匯兌業務總量，折合銀元為九五六，一四三，〇〇〇元，二十三度則增至九八九，四四六，〇〇〇元，計增加三三，三〇三，〇〇〇元。若依美金計算，則增加數量尤鉅。</p>
<p>（五）發行兌換券</p>
<p>二十三年度年終，本行兌換券流通總額為二〇四，七一三，四六五·四一，較之二十二年終流通總額，計增加二〇，九八六，四六八·〇四。在兌換券準備金方面，現金準備共一二九，六六〇，八二六·八九，計合流通總額百分之六三，保證準備共七五，〇五二，六三八·五二（有價證券六一，六一七，二六八·四九，房產道契六，四六一，三七五·〇三，其餘為行莊領券之保證準備），計合流通總額百分之三七。</p>
<p>（六）有價證券</p>
<p>二十三年年終本行有價證券總額為八六，九八一，五九九·〇六（保證準備部份六一，六一七，二六八·四九，營業部份二五，三六四，三三〇·五七），占全體資產百分之八·八，較二十二年度之八一，八四七，〇四五·九一，計增加五，一三，五五一·一五。良以定期存欺銳增，為運用分散起見，故增加如上數。茲將金銀兩種證券之百分率列左：</p>
<p>二十三年年終　二十一年年終</p>
<p>銀幣證券　七九·二　七七·一</p>
<p>金幣證券　二〇·八　二二·九</p>
<p>（七）損益</p>
<p>甲，各項開支二十三年度各項開支，為六百六十六萬六千餘元，比二十二年度計增加六十一萬二千餘元。查本行各項開支，包括營業費在內，二十三年度郵電加價，本行營業費支出，因之銳增；而是年度本行業務增進，機關添設，亦為開支增加之主要原因。</p>
<p>乙，盈餘分配　二十三年度純益一，九三三，三一七·〇一，除照章提十分之一即一九三，三三一·七〇為公積金，餘一，七三九，九八五·三一。此數加上年滾存六，五四〇·二八，减去攤派官商股七　正息一，七二九，八五四·〇〇，下餘一六，六七一·五九，仍列盈餘滾存項下。查本行未收股本二十八萬七千八百元，業於二十三年年底收足；惟因係自二十四年一月一日起息，所以二十三年度股息，仍照原有巳收股本二千四百七十一萬二千二百元計算。</p>

<h3>為什麼要運動</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>外國人常常說：「五口人要有强的腦子，唯有運動而已。」這兩句話送到吾們中國人的耳朶裏，就要反對着：「吾國古時候的一般彎腰曲背的秀才們，他們都是文質彬彬的，一天到晚只知孜孜不倦的攻讀，根本不知道什麼運動不運動，那知他們都能做美妙的文章；况且他們的腦子比現在運動的人，更要聰明，而且强得多呢。」關於這幾句話，理由雖然很充足，但是反轉來一想，外國人所說的話，一些也不錯；你想，秀才的腦子，雖然强而且聰明，不過是暫時的；因為他們不運動的緣故，所以在少年時，旣是這樣的衰弱，到了老的時候，那是他們的軀幹和精神，更要衰弱，於是他們的腦子也就遲鈍起來了！</p>
<p>現在吾們平日運動的人，身體當然鍜鍊得很堅固的，倘使到了老的時候，那是一定精神矍鑠，而腦子也决不會遲鈍了</p>
<p>亲愛的小朋友！你們看了以為對嗎？</p>
<h3>怎樣與兒童做朋友</h3>
<p>— 黃警頑</p>
<p>成人與兒童的心理是完全不同的，成人因為受環境的影饗，各方面都要蛻變，當然，兒時的天眞在成人的時候是不會有的，因此要與小朋友做朋友，最先决的條伴魷是要知道兒童的本性，不知道兒童的本性就根本談不到這個問題。</p>
<p>從那幾方面可知道兒童的本性，現在魷我所知道的供獻給讀者：</p>
<p>（一）（遊戲）　遊戲是兒童的天然傾向，在學校未施强制敎育以前，遊戲是兒童的本性，有人說遊戲是兒童的第二生命，確是不錯，兒童與成人不同，兒童的遊戲是他的工作，不是休息是他所特有的無所謂的且帶有快樂情緒的工作，為使兒童們發展天然的本能計，不得不使他充分的發揮知慧，這就是在遊戲中可見到他們的知慧，所以在兒童玩要的時候，切不可禁北他。</p>
<p>（二）（說話）　兒童是剛從母胎中接觸到世界，他對於世界的一切情形，都是隔膜的，當然他是不會說現在的話，但是他有靈感，當然他也有要說的話發表出來，於是他不得不在舉止動作中表現出來，因此成人一定要注意到他的一舉一功，因為他的一舉一動都是在內心的慾望所使，當他正在嘰哩咕嚕的時候，其實他們是在說話，我們不要不知道他們的說話。</p>
<p>（三）（思想）　兒童的思想是漸漸進步的，因此他的思想常常轉變，我們要使他們親密，一定要先知道他的思想，兒童生後一年，僅能借知覺以營思想作用，此後思想又轉換了，改變了，能感覺了，能記憶了，思想又換了一種別的方式，借想像聯像來活動，取事實物的性質和槪念的特性都明確了，判斷和推理也能運用，於是所謂兒童的知慧作用，人類唯一的精神活動，也就發達到極點，一般以成人的方法看兒童，不能以兒童看兒童，所以對於兒童很多誤解，成人不能向兒童思想進化的歷程，因之發展思想的方法也多錯誤，若以成人眼光評論兒童思想，兒童所想的自多不合利，倘卽以此不合理的一些方法去責備他衊視他，他就以後受了壓迫，不敢多講，所以成人對於抑止的兒童的思想應多注意。</p>
<p>（四）（情感）　從兒童精神生話土去觀察，和情最有密切的關係了，就是本能和氣質，本能發現時，就有一種情參雜其間，本能發現不論當與不當，都能引起安快或不快的簡單感情以至喜怒愛樂，並且最應當注意的就是不要拿成人感情去推察兒童的感情。</p>
<p>以上是與小朋友們按友的應有知識現在要說到方法了：</p>
<p>（一）（親密）　兒童是最怕兇惡的舉動，如果用機密的方法漸漸的去與他聯絡於是最後他令成為你的同舟共濟的朋友。</p>
<p>（二）（指導）　兒童常有許多疑問，你如果替他們解答了，他就非常感激你，並且樂與你為友。</p>
<p>（三）（玩耍）　兒童拿玩要算他的必修課，因此成人們應該與他們一起，脫去成人的假面具也硬表示兒童的稚態，於是方可得到他們的同情。</p>
<h3>空氣和呼吸</h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>敏兒的父親是一個化學先生所以敏兒一見他的父親有空閒的時候，便要呌他老人家變戲法，但是他的父親也很喜歡的變給他看。</p>
<p>在一天的下午，他的父親買了兩隻玻璃瓶回來，便呌敏兒去拿一碗石灰水來，把石灰浸在水裏。一會兒那石灰都溶化成一種混濁的水。把這水濾過一遍，又變成淸水了。</p>
<p>敏兒便很詫異的問道：「爸爸！這是淸水？還是石灰水」？</p>
<p>他的父親說：『這是石灰水。因為把這些未曾溶掉的石灰，都濾掉了，那已經溶掉的石灰，都溶在這水裏，連你自已的眼睛也欺騙你當作是淸水。』</p>
<p>於是他的父親把石灰水等量的灌到兩隻剛才買來的玻璃瓶裏，用三根玻璃管裝在兩隻瓶的瓶口，（見圖）戲法才開始</p>
<p>他的父親把手指捏住丁管，用嘴吸戊管，使空氣從甲瓶裏吸進來。再把手指捏住丙管，而放開丁管，使吸進的空氣，從乙瓶呼出，那麼便看見空氣經過甲瓶的時候，瓶裏的石灰不起變化。空氣從嘴裏呼出，經過乙瓶，瓶裏的石灰水，就變成牛乳一般的水了。</p>
<p>敏兒看　這個戲法，很是有趣，但是一些也不懂這是什麼道理，便問他的父親：『爸爸，怎麼兩瓶淸的石灰水，經你一吹後，便變了牛乳一般的水了？這是什麼緣故？</p>
<p>他的父親說：『不要忙，待我一一告訴你。我們人類呼炭吸氣，植物恰是呼氧吸炭。倘使一日沒有氣的存在，我們都要死了，可見我們和植物有密切的關係。這個戲法，可以證明空氣經過人呼吸之後，空氣裏面的氧，便在人體中起變化，而成炭酸氣（二氧化炭）。炭酸氣經過石灰水後，使起變化，成白色的沉澱物。所以住在人多而窗戶關閉的房屋裏，很不相宜，以後你不要再去看電影了。並且夜間臥室裏不可放花，因為植物在夜裏，呼氧吸炭，空氣中很少有氧的存在，很不衛生』。</p>
<h3>「那摩溫」（蝌蚪）</h3>
<p>— 洪式孟</p>
<p>春日的郊外是多麼美麗呀！田野是一片嫩綠色，夾雜着金黃的菜花，樹土的新葉子像蒙着一層淺綠色的車九紗似的。小朋友、如果你到野外去旅行，你也許會遇到一條浜，你總會忍不住要去到洪邊看看吧。當心不要滑到浜裏去。啊！看哪！洪水裏有許多黑點子在浮游着，還拖着一條小尾巴呢！那小尾巴宛轉地，矢矯地擺着，成羣成陣，多麼好看！有幾個小朋友想盡方法捕捉了幾尾，放在帶來的一個玻璃瓶裏，預備回來問問爸爸或奢先生，這是什麼東西。</p>
<p>小朋友，讓我來告訴你吧，這叫蚪蚪（讀如科斗　　　又）在字典裏又叫作「活東」，但是上海有許多小朋友叫它作「那摩溫」。這是靑蛙的（即癩蛤蝶）幼蟲。原夾靑蛙初生出來的時候是滾圓的像一顆顆胡椒珠子，那時候是不會動的，過了幾時，長出尾巴來了，便會游冰了，這時便開始它們的生活，這便是小朋友抽捉的「那摩溫。」再過幾時，它們的身體長的史大了，先長出一雙小小的後足，隨後又生出一雙前足，尾巴也漸漸縮短，縮得沒有了，那便是小靑蛙。靑蛙是會把田裏的害蟲吃掉的，所以它們是農人的好朋友。讓我們來唱一隻蝌蚪歌吧。如果你不會唱這歌，你可以請音樂先生致你，也許先生能答應你的請求的。</p>

<p>黑夜裏，小老鼠待着人聲都盡了，跳出了洞。一陣奇香的肉味透進鼻來。</p>
<p>「好東西！我三天沒有吃過啦！」</p>
<p>小老鼠嗅着鼻子，饞涎流在嘴邊。跳呀跳的跳到了常戲要的床頂上。這肉味眞是這裏發洩的，在一個有趣的鐵籠子裏吊着一塊紅燒猪肉。一陣陣怪香的肉味。小老鼠的銳涎流在嘴下上。它的手指觸在籠上。</p>
<p>「不行，這是殘酷的人們的陷坑吧！」</p>
<p>小老鼠盤着後腿坐着，心兒又泳冷啦！它記起了它父親的話：</p>
<p>「不要吃容易得到的食物，這是人們的陷坑呵！」</p>
<p>它想到這話，又跳呵跳的跑啦，但是這怪香的肉味，自已飢餓的肚子，那能忍心捨下，</p>
<p>隔壁獃大哥的足音也出來了。</p>
<p>「進去銜了它便跑出來，不妨事吧？不要給大哥捷足先得。」想着，就很留意地捱進了籠子。牙齒搭上了猪肉，用力向外拖，忽然——</p>
<p>「拍塌！」籠子的門倒啦！一根鐵閂橫了下來，小老鼠慌忙放了肉向外跑。頭兒猛撞在鐵門上，撞回了好多路，昏過去啦！</p>
<p>「不要吃容易得到的食物，這是人們的陷坑呵！」</p>
<h3>踏㿜的乒乓球</h3>
<p>— 顏鑫泉</p>
<p>小朋友！我們在校裏，不是時時玩着乒乓球嗎？可是在拾球的時候，往往會因了一時的魯莽，誤將乒乓球踏癟，而致負賠償的責任，這不是一件可恨的事嗎？現在有一個方法，能使已經踏　，尚無破損的乒乓球復圓。復圓後，依然和新的一式無二。</p>
<p>方法是這樣的：祗須將踏癟的乒乓球，拋入沸水中，數分鐘後，卽能復圓了。這是什麼緣故呢？凡物體遇熱則漲，遇冷則縮，現在把球放到沸水裏，球內的氣，逐漸受熱而膨脹，所以能使那踏　的乒乓球，受那膨脹的關係，就漸漸的復圓子。假使已經有不破損，這方法就沒有效力了。</p>
<p>我們是時代的生力軍，推動着巨輪前進！</p>

<h3>兒童吃的故事——怪糖</h3>
<p>— 洗冠生</p>
<p>風風已不如冬天的嚴寒，也不像夏天的炎熱，牠從東海的盡頭，橫渡過遼闊的洋面，吹向着我們的大陸，轉初了磨坊的風車，送來了多年飄泊的歸舟，喚醒了冬眠　虫和枯草，吹開了孩子們沈悶寂寞的心，當牠吹過快樂之園的時候，兒童節會場上正擠滿了到會的兒童，在唱黨歌呼口號，彩色的標語，都散在地下，牠—風—鼓足了氣努力地吹，花花紙在空中飄舞着，橡蝴蝶般的美麗，快樂之園充滿了快樂天眞活潑。</p>
<p>兒童節的儀式，舉行過了以後，大家都記得主席和來賓的演說，回到家裏，聰　的小愛華還能背得出幾句「……養成兒童採用國貨的習慣，建設兒童將來抵制舶來品挽回利權的心理……」，回家以後，常在嘴裏念着，晚上，在床上也是這樣念着。</p>
<p>外面有人在敲門，進來的，是，爸爸的同鄉宗伯伯，和爸爸的外國朋友楊伯伯，他們看見小愛華，撫着他的頭，向着他爸爸說：「我歡喜這天使，所以在今天兒童節送點薄禮來賀節一，說時他們招呼着外面的車夫拿進兩大包糖菓放在桌上，爸爸受了禮呌小愛華對兩個朋友鞠躬致謝。</p>
<p>客人去了，哥哥和姐姐回來看見桌上的糖菓，嚷着要吃糖，媽媽說：「孩子們大家吃宗伯伯的糖吧：楊伯伯的糖裏面有飛機，大砲，炸彈的，吃不去了不得的」！媽媽到樓上去，哥哥和姐姐，便偷偷地打開了楊伯伯送來的糖，嘴裏吃着，那糖眞是美麗奪目的好看，香甜的味兒送進小愛華的鼻孔，他拿了一個望遠鏡式的怪糖，在手裏把玩，放在眼上向裏而瞧着，裏而有一個很大的機器，楊伯伯在上面控制，它能把，我們的洋錢，角子，銅元，都吸了進去，變成了，飛機，槍砲，炸彈，瓦斯，兵艦，坦克車，從下而鐵門裏去出來，不到五分鐘，飛機，大砲，步兵，瓦斯，兵艦，坦克車，向着我們大地出動，快樂之園變成了戰場，殺死了多少同胞，轟毀了城郭，住宅，爸爸和媽媽給敵人擄了去，哥哥和姐姐吃的是炸彈，，才下肚子，使轟地一聲，屍肉橫飛，小愛華急得哭也哭不出，楊伯伯從外面進來，小愛華拉住他的手，求他將爸爸和媽媽放了回來，楊伯伯忽然間已變成猙獰兇惡得可怕，兩隻手抓住了小愛華，張開血盆大口，將小愛華送進去，裏面人血的腥氣悶得要死，小愛華恐怖極了</p>
<p>「啊呀！媽呀！…救命啊！……」</p>
<p>「好孩子！什麼事？你怕麼？媽在這裏」！</p>
<p>他看見媽媽慈祥的面龐，幾乎哭出來了。</p>
<p>「媽！我不吃外國糖菓了，眞的！裏面有飛機，大砲，兵艦，炸彈，會炸死我們的可怕人的啊！</p>
<p>窗外的風，拂拂地吹進了窗櫺，帘鈞丁東，丁東，還像大砲的餘音在轟炸着咧！</p>

<h3>兒童節感言</h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>兒童是未來社會的主人翁，所以在我們這百事不得解决的中國，去年居然提出了兒童問題，定今年為兒童年，預備在今年的「四四」兒童節，舉行兒童年的擴大宣傳運動。雖因籌備不及已改在明年舉行，但兒童問題之被關心，似乎已是事實。</p>
<p>可是細察將在兒童年擴大運動的項目，不外舉行全國兒童健康比賽，競技，演說比賽，此外還有什麼兒童音樂會，見童全國旅行隊，……假使中國的兒童，都有資格，有機會參加這些運動，那是多麼美滿的一椿事情？可是實情却有许多不如意的事象。</p>
<p>所謂兒童問題，本來不外「敎」和「養」的問題。說到見童的敎和養，我們首先會想到成人——兒童的父母—的生活問題。在年來的內憂外患，農村破產，工商業不景氣的情况下，我國一般人的生活，都在生死的界綫上掙扎，怎配得上講兒童的敎養？所以我國的兒童，除出部分的幸運者外，其他不是自生自減，就是慘被殺戮。被殺戮的路途有二。一是墮胎，二是被溺斃或遺棄。墮胎在醫學幼稺的中國，眞是危險萬分，且法律又加制罰，然而墮胎者仍大有其人，女子誰沒有母性？誰願違法胃險，去殺死未來的小生命？這裏當然有著不得已的苦衷在。這苦衷大半由於經濟的困迫，小部分由於舊禮敎的吃人。私生子的不能見容於社會，就是禮敎吃人的明蹬。至於旣安全地生下來，仍被溺斃或遺棄的，單就報章上的記載，已是記不勝記。它的原因，當然也不外上述兩種。此外僥倖地不被殺戮遺棄的，亦只是聽天有命，自生自減！所以中國兒童的死亡率，較任何國家為高，據統計，每年每千嬰孩中，死亡者約二五〇，實際上也許不北此數。這是關於「養」的一般的情形，其次再來談談關於「敎一，</p>
<p>「敎」？固然，現在幼穉園，小學，中學，隨處都有了，兒童的敎育問題，似乎不成問題。然而別一面，我們可看到，農村兒童的隨着父母，轉輾流徙；工人的幼見稺子被拋在屋角檐前，獨自模索，孤兒棄女，處處飄泊流浪；此外工廠中的大批童工，做着妨碍心身發展的勞作，等於奴隸的學徒，終日過着鞭罵生活，他們沒有受到敎育的機會與福分，有的只是無情的鞭韃與機器的害傷。呌了幾十年的義務敎育，依舊是紙上談兵。總計全國失學兇童不下四千萬左右。在此慶祝兒童節的前夕，部分兒童，果然將歡天喜地，有福分去參加盛會，然而那大部分的，却都在顚沛流浪，困苦凄凉下，度着這春寒的時節。這些，只希望在未來的兒童年擴大運動時，特別注意。</p>
<p>其實兒童問題，正和婦女問題同樣，亦是社會問題之一，社會制度尚未合理化的現在，空談兒童幸福，亦只是畫餅充饑，或部分的幸運兒童，得到此許福利而已。興大衆兒童，簡直風馬牛不相及。不過社會制度的合理化，當不是一朝一夕，卽能辦到的事情。那未在這社會制度尚未合理化之前，我們除出努力將它設法，使它合理化之外，希望盡可能地都市中竭力多設勞働托兒所，農村中，多設農忙托兒所，努力推廣敎育，多設平民醫院，這些也許比空談的演講會，唱唱「幸福呀」，「愛呀」的歌兒的遊藝會更來得切實些。</p>
<h3>韋明之前的萬難</h3>
<p>— 寗父</p>
<p>不久之前，在報紙上看見過一聯某女士惋悼影星阮玲玉的饒有深意的輓對，原文彷彿是：「韋明之前，尚有萬難；艾霞而後，今又一人，」其實，我以為以其拿這兩句警語來哀悼阮玲玉女士的自殺，倒不如加以若干補充，用以警惕現時代受難着的廣大的女性。這兒所說的補充，就是一，現在面對着萬難的女性，不僅「韋明型」的智識階級，二，假使廣泛的被壓迫女性對於這滋長着的萬難沒有正視和爭關的决心，那麼繼韋明而自殺的女性，倒正不止阮玲玉女士一個而已。</p>
<p>儼存在我們眼前的，眞是一個萬方多難的時代，在社會生活，一方面是外敵侵陵，他方面是飢荒戰亂，一兩年前還能勉强地掙扎於飢餓綫上的人們，目前却已經毫不容情地被驅上了死亡的絕路，在精神生活，那是和帝國主義的槍砲與經濟並行的文化支配，正和土著的封建勢力牢牢地結合起來，猛烈地開始了逆時代的復古運動、節婦殉夫，孝女尋父，一切十六七世紀的「　事美談，」都已經一一地再現於三十年代的中國。外在的經濟的受難、內心的精神的苦悶，「新女性」主角韋明的經歷的悲劇，從某一視角觀察，可以說是現在中國中間層知識階級婦女的共有的事情。</p>
<p>五四時代的市民層和小市民層知識份子所唱導的反封建運動，和其他一切文化部門所留下的過程一樣，領導者們未曾擊破敵人主力而就將他們的壓史的使命　　　　他　　　　　　　　　　　其他一面，應該擔當起這種歷史的使命的後來者們，卻因為次殖民地的社會的經濟的原因，被限定在一種文化的地無力的，非紐織的形態。於是，在這偉大的，可是充滿了苦難的過程，中國的廣泛的婦女大衆，就被殘酷地驅上了非對兩種强敵作戰不可的戰綫。說，一面是為着生存而對社會機構的戰　，他方是為着人性而對男性中心的一切觀念的　爭。</p>
<p>有人說影片「新女性」描為了三個中國現代女性的典型，但是在筆者的意思倒以為不如說是這祇是劇作者為着說明的便利而採擇了一種表現的方法，劇中的王默秋和阮玲玉這兩種性格，矛盾而淆混地遍存在一切中國和智識階級女性的中間，而劇中所表現一般的殷虛的個性，現在還正孕育在紅磚和鋼鐵所構成的工廠的裏面！當然，生活的鞭責，和為生活而爭闕的精神，可以减殺智識份子所特有的威傷和對於所謂「精神的悲劇」的苦悶，可是當我們進一步而接觸現實的時候，我們就會驚愕於牢固地支配着一切生產層女性的心靈和觀念的那種千百年來傳續下來的對建勢力的偉大的！</p>
<p>為着千百萬被壓迫女性的人格和生存，一切進步的智識層的婦女應該勇敢地擔負起前期婦女運動者所未完成的使命，奴性的苟安和宗敎的幻想已經不是有自覺的女性的安息的地方，虛無和頹廢的雲霧也不能再阻障有自覺的女性的對於將來的展望，那麼讓我們大膽地凝視現實，坦懷地認識自己，為着自救和救千百萬的同類，和同運動命的人們站在一起，排着萬難，再來一次反封建反禮　　新的攻　吧。</p>

<h3>第三由母權制到父權制</h3>
<p>— 君慈</p>
<p>一種制度的成立與沒落，必然有其社會的經濟的原因，換言之，在某種社會的經濟的條件之下，必然發生與之適應的某種制度。</p>
<p>母權制度怎樣崩壞，父權制度如何成立？這個問題在前節中已略為說及，但在此更進一步去認識這問題，我想還不益徒勞的。</p>
<p>首先，原始母樣制度的存續條件可分為如下三種：</p>
<p>第一在原始社會，男子是大部分從事戰爭，社會存續上所必要的物質的生產，全由婦女負担，因而婦女在生產勞動上占重要地位。她們不單養活自己，並且要養育子女，所以不得不努力生產。採拾草根木果，捕獲小動物烏蛋等就是她們的經常生產活動。她們在這種生產行為中，遂發明農業和家畜，由此，生產物格外增大，同時婦女在經濟上的地位更被提高。</p>
<p>第二原始人類的兩性結合形式，大部是羣體婚，所生子女只知有母而不知有父，因而母性在家族中占重要地位，並且發生了母系氏族，男子娶妻必加入妻方氏族，結果，婦女完全掌握性的選探權。</p>
<p>第三，氏族內的財產如土地，生產物，其他生產工具等，原是全氏族的共同所有，但其管理及分配權屬於年長的婦女，並且單單女子為同一的血族，故財產承繼權亦祗限於女子。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但母權制度並不是婦女專制或壓迫男于的意味。這裏婦女之優越地位，乃是為着種的繁殖女性所應有的性的選探權利，而不是男女間的絕對的隸屬關係。在母　社會，是共同生產，共同消費，個人的利害和社會的利害一致。旣無不勞而獲者亦無勞而不獲者。</p>
<p>可是，這制度終於被崩壞了。這崩壤的原因可分為以下二點。</p>
<p>第一，隨着新的生產手段的發明，農業及牧畜業急激發達，需要大量的勞動力，因為勞動力愈多，生產物便愈大，於是男子們從戰爭中捕獲異族，作為奴隸，使之作生產勞動，這樣，男子便由戰爭的指揮者變為生產的指導者，遂一躍而占經濟上的重要地位。</p>
<p>第二，氏族的人口增加，分裂成多數氏族，異氏族之結婚禁止成為不可能，於是羣體婚制改為對偶婚，即一定的男女同棲，所生子女為他們自己的子女，這樣，在氏族內發生多數小家族，小家族和全體氏族的利害不能一致，結果，母權氏族竟陷於瓦解狀態。</p>
<p>這樣，母權氏族遂被崩壞，婦女的地位和勢力很快的衰退，父權便起而代之。</p>
<p>那末，父權制度在社會中所起的作用是怎樣呢？牠的第一特徵是財產私有制，母權共同體瓦解以後，一切生產手段為年長的男子，即戰時的指揮官所占有，同時由於奴蘇制的勞動，生產物大見增加，氏族內發生剩餘生產物，這剩餘部分亦歸為族長的所有，而發生了所有奢和非所有者。</p>
<p>第二的特徵是階級制度。奴隸勞動開始以後，發生勞動的指揮者和直接勞動者兩毬人，也就發生了主人和奴隸，貴奢和賤奢。</p>
<p>第三的特徵是嫁娶婚制。男子利用經濟的擾越地位，奪取婦女的性的選擇權。婦女嫁給男子成了男子的洩慾機器。</p>
<p>第四的特徵是多妻制度，男子除了掠奪異族的婦女作為妻妾外，祇要有資產便可以收買女子，做玩弄的工具。</p>
<p>第五的特徵是要求婦女的貞操。性慾原是和其他的情慾同樣很自然的，但男子為着正出子的財產相續的必要，絕對獎勵女子的性的專一。</p>
<p>第六的特徵是小家族制度。私有財產制是以個人的私有為經濟單位，因此發生以個人為中心的小家庭，妻及子女為夫及父的所有物，有絕對的處置權。</p>
<p>這種不合理的男權制度存續到數千年之久，而把婦女在肉體上精神上退化到最低劣的非人的境地！</p>
<p>最後，我們從上述，可以看出如下兩點。</p>
<p>第一，男權制度是財產私有的，母權制度是財產共有的。</p>
<p>第二，男權社會是有階級的，而母權社會是無階級的。</p>
<h3>健康美與姿態美</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>相貌美是人人所喜歡的，可是天生的美人太少，鍛練可以補不足。</p>
<p>中國古來說女子底美不美，多在面貌上去評價，以為面孔美的就是美人了，其它可以不管</p>
<p>固然，面貌美他女子美的主要條件，可是只取面貌美而忽略其它，巳經不是今日美人的評價了。</p>
<p>現代美人底資格，應該要從整個而說，面貌，姿態，健康，及精神，必須這些條件都齊備，她才得稱為眞正的美人。缺一缺二，她底資格就有缺憾了，她是否美人，那就是難决定的了。</p>
<p>假如一個面貌美麗的女子，她底身體消瘦，脆弱，滿面是病容，她得稱為合格的美人麼？不！她沒有健康，身體不健康，是沒有生動，鮮妍，可愛的魅力。</p>
<p>假如她面貌美麗，身體又健康，而她底姿勢是畸形的，彎背，偏肩，縮頸，腿短，或腰組，沒有臀部的曲綫，甚至呆板，綳硬，走起路來不像樣，她能說是合格的美人麼？不！她底姿態有毛病。姿態有毛病，有時候比生得不美更難看。</p>
<p>假如一個面貌並不怎樣美的的女子，而身材很漂亮，只要她肯努力銀練，使她身體健康，活發，風姿優美，挺拔，又有精神，那她准可稱為美人。因為她有鍛練的補助，鍛練出來的健康美，姿態美，這是人力可以奪天工的美容法。再加上她天生的姿態，姿態是美人底大條件喲！</p>
<p>健康美，姿態美，不但能改造人底容貌，補天生的不足，而且身體健康了很能做許多事業，西人說：有健全的身體，乃有健全的精神。偉大的事業，他靠健全的精神去做的：又一個精神旣然健全，儀表又秀俊高尚的人，她絕不肯幹下流不名譽的勾當，由是可養成自己高尚的品性。健康美，姿態美的功喲效！</p>
<p>為着麥成優秀的國民，我們要怎樣積極地去注重道個問題？</p>
<p>一般地說：中國人太不注重健康了，自　人，富翁，以至牢獄，工廠，全不衛生，不好運動，讓身體柔弱，沒有　　　　　　　　　　乏堅忍無毅力，又很少勤勞的習慣：對于姿態好不好，更很少人去注意它，甚麼高尚的儀表，舉止優雅，大方，這些古話，現今多少人心目中，又好像沒有這回事。</p>
<p>因此，體弱如爬蟲，形骸似烏龜，卑污苟賤，無所不為的人多着。觸目傷心的民族墜落喲</p>
<p>自從提倡健美運動以來，女子也講究體育了，有美人魚的大出風頭，還風行裸腿，裸臂，裏緊身體的服裝，把健康美，姿態美，全歪曲在出風頭上，歪曲在肉感上。好事拿到中國，總要變壞的喲！</p>
<p>常在街上看見一些摩登婦女，像煞是健康美又有姿態美，她們也做出那昂頭，挺胸，揚氣十足的樣子，走起路來高跟鞋奪奪奪地很有節奏，使人不勝羨纂的。但她們底內容如何？眞正身體健康否？不擔脂粉染妍面孔，不靠嬌柔造作裝威風的有幾個？</p>
<p>固然，我不否認那中間，也有眞正健康的特出者。但那是很少數。</p>
<p>另有許多女子，不論面貌娟秀或平常，她們底身體都很脆弱，一點精神也沒有，走起步來拖拖踏踏提不起步，彷彿生存是一個重祖子，壓死了她們底生氣，苟且偷安，一股兒　氣，就從她們底行動舉止表現出來，有的低着頭，　着背，死氣沉沉像幽靈，有的聳着肩，偏着頸，陰笨笨，左搖右擺醜不堪。</p>
<p>這種現象，是表現了中國民族的墮落！</p>
<p>甚麼女性美，在這裏簡直說不上！</p>
<p>婦女們底這個弱點：小之害了自已的健康，失了自已底美貌，殺了自己底威儀和生氣；大之丟了民族底面孔，造成懦弱無用的國民，苟目地生茍且地死，等假着做亡國奴。民族危亡的恐怖喲！</p>
<p>健康就是美，就是幸福；姿態美很壯觀瞻。美和幸福和壯觀瞻，該是每個女子所希望的。除了最不幸的在特殊原因的限制不，不能得到健康之外，普通女子，應該盡力追求這個希望</p>
<p>姿態美和健康美是有密切關係的，除開天生的苗條秀麗興否之外，其它如　背，偏肩，低頭，呆笨，步伐放不開，都能從體操的鍛練矯正過來的。體操能使身體健康，也能便姿態正確多風致。至於風度的飄逸，瀟灑，　秀，俊美，挺拔，剛勁，高尚，那就因人底個性不同　各異，不能强同的。</p>
<p>總之，我們要每個女子都有健康美，姿態美無論　　　　　　　　　　　　天旣　　　　姿態起碼要正確，要抬起頭，挺起胸襟走路，步伐要放得開，走得快。若能早眠早起，注重衛生，及練習自己底姿態更好。</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，她是因先天和後天的特殊情形最多病的。有人問她：你這樣多病，又病得兇，加以窮，為甚麼還沒有死？她說：我平日每早操三百動乃至五百動，臨睡時也操四五十動，我肺部每天起碼做二十個深呼吸，我又注重衛生，大病了，我就平心靜氣，絲毫不燥。這樣，我怎麼會死呢？我以為這是一個體操保命的實詩。</p>
<p>當這國際的狂潮摧殘着中國，我國底婦女，已陷入苦難的重圍，我們必項强調着生存的慾望，鍛練自己底體力與智慧，用團結的力量，突破這個重圍，而開始新生向上的展望。因此，我希望全中國底男女老少，都提唱健康美，姿態美，以養成强壯優秀的國民，來答覆這個洶湧的狂潮！只有健康美才能打破中國底積弱，使種族優生化；只有姿態美才能掃蕩苟且墮落的醜態，收到民族傑出的效果！</p>
<h3>姨太太日記（續）</h3>
<p>— 關露</p>
<p>三月二十二日</p>
<p>×長這幾天對我又有點陰陽怪氣了。早上遞衣服給他的時候他總是愛理不理的，就只晚上喝醉了酒回來的那一團子勁。白天看看他那樣子倒像晚上不是睡在一塊兒的一樣。你問他什麼他總是「你們女人不懂，女人只會穿衣吃飯」</p>
<p>唉！誰說女人裝扮得好看不是為着丈夫的呢？他兩晚不回來睡，總　着香水酒在身上辜負了香氣似的，口紅和粉擦着也覺得有點無聊。怪不得老太婆不愛打扮了。假如老太婆可以找一個闊男人的話，縱然粉擦着不好看，香水一定也是愛的。老太婆罵年靑人愛打扮，十足地是含着嫉妒心。</p>
<p>人總是怕老的。不知怎麼的，每天照着鏡子，有時覺着很年靑，有時覺着竟然臉上起了皺紋了。記得有這樣一句話：「人老珠黃不值錢。是的，假如女人自己有錢的話，誰願意嫁一個有鬍子的男人呢！我一生算是和三個年靑的男人往來過，但是他們出不起贖身價呀！×長雖然年紀大了，但是他能够出錢，他算得了便宜。再隔幾年他還要嫌我老呢！那時他又不願意為我花錢了。</p>
<p>鏡子恐怕是少女最喜歡的，我現在漸漸地……但是我不願意很快地就討厭牠！</p>
<p>三月二十五日</p>
<p>今天早上×長那一場脾氣發得眞奇怪，怎麼我會和李秘書的兄弟去好呢！這幾日他說部裏公事忙，不能在家裏；老太太病勢又重，他不許我出去，呌我在家裏聽他的電話，不能叫我整日的坐牢哇！小李和李秘書的太太一同來了，我和他打兩圈麻將又算什麼呢！我覺得今天的氣大有點使人難過。但是沒有法子，做了女人！男人玩姑娘是不要緊的。他不玩姑娘還不會娶了我呢，我還看見過他的太太呢！</p>
<p>他又說我的頭髮燙得變了樣子，不知準備去迷什麼人！其實還是因為上次他說了拖在後面不好看，我才改成這樣的呢。</p>
<p>他一生氣就為上調查起我的月費來了。我這幾個月都沒有打過五十元的麻將。從前沒有嫁人的時候，只要生意紅，多用幾個錢倒還不食受這樣的氣。其實嫁了人還不是一樣地做生意，一樣地睡覺拿錢。不過說起來不是給人嫖罷了。</p>
<p>三月二十九日</p>
<p>×長前天罵了我，見我一聲不想，也覺着自己太威風了，昨大從李秘嘗那事回來，帶了一個鑽石戒指給我。據說那戒指原來是趙行長的三姨太太的，因為去年有一次她賭回力球，賭輸了瞞着行長，托李秘書拿了去押的，現在她本人死了，押主又仍舊託李秘書拿來賤賣。</p>
<p>這戒指的確狠好，純粹外國的鑲工，據說原價可以值六百多兩，但現在×長買來只四百塊錢。據楊媽說還不上四百塊錢呢，只二百七十塊錢，×長故意向我把價錢說高些！</p>
<p>我從小就喜歡鑽石，我想這東西沒有那個人不喜歡的，那麼亮，又那麼輕巧。不過牠的缺點就是不能照人。</p>
<p>春天來了，風還是那樣呼呼地響！院子裏的花架子都吹動了，明天花匠又要忙個不了。</p>
<p>我打算睡覺，不等他了，簡直無聊得坐不住，還不知道他行麼時候才回來呢，現在已經十二點了！</p>
<p>三月三十一日</p>
<p>昨大連小姐的外祖父孫老太爺做八十歲生日，眞熱鬧，唱了堂戲，酒都開了一千多兩銀子的，自然，兒子和女婿都做着官，老太爺的生日還不是大事嗎？像前次王廚子的父親過生日，那還是因為兒子在當大司務，才從我們廚房裏端過兩碗鶏湯麵去。聽說他那位老太婆在鄉下養了一輩子的鷄，自己還不曾吃過一碗鶏湯麵呢！</p>
<p>聽說我的媽也沒有吃過鷄湯下麵，唉，她現在死了，不然，……不管女兒是嫁給人也好，賣給人也好，女兒有鑽石戒指戴，媽總…</p>
<p>眞的，提起鑽石戒指，想起昨天去孫家拜壽的那件事來了：女客當中戴鑽戒的眞不少，但是將我的和她們比起來，我的好多了，那麼亮，鑲得又那麼精巧；戒指亮，使得我一身都亮了，彷彿我的臉上都在發光。但是後來看堂戲的時候，讓後面那穿西裝的盯了我一眼，我倒反覺得難為情起來。為什麼他的眼睛那麼很毒，是嫉妒，還是輕侮呢？他那很毒一眼，好像眼睛裏盡帶着刺，從我的心裏一直刺到臉上，登時我便覺得我那發光的臉變得發紅了：究竟他是什麼原因要那樣看我呢？他莫非是知道我常常在家裏挨罵，而這戒指就是罵我的人給我的！我這麼一不硬氣，為什麼要從罵我的人那裏接過這戒指來呢！恐怕他還不只是想着挨罵的一件事，他更知道關於我的許多別的事體！</p>
<p>恐怕他還不只是對我一個人是這樣想法，他一定更知道許多戴丈夫鑽戒的女人們的事情。但是，最好是他不知道，假使知道的話，戒指就不會那樣使人發光了。</p>
<p>今天下午又是一場氣！</p>
<p>四月五日</p>
<p>這幾天都運着下雨，陰森森的天氣把人的心境都影響壞了。何况像我這樣本來就是受着氣，過着陰暗生活的人！</p>
<p>今天為了叫人打掃客廳，用人不小心，把李秘書送的那隻花瓶打破了，×長回來了立刻就大發雷霆，罵我畜生，飯桶，還罵我婊子，賤骨頭，為什麼不招呼用人小心一點！我知道為什麼呢？我招呼了他他不小心有什麼辦法呢</p>
<p>用人讓他他個耳光打跑了。用人可以跑哇，辭了工去進薦頭行！我呢，我是罵不跑的，可以盡量的給人出氣，從這裏了不能到別家去。况且我現在是一個孕婦。怪得我上次要墮胎他不準啦，一小小孩子可以鎖住一個女人的心。把女人鎖住了，男人在外邊無論幹什麼都是放心的。反正有錢的男人，是不妨多鎖幾個女人在家裏。從前是一定要做了皇帝才可以有三宮六院，現在只要是有錢的男人都可以學皇帝！</p>
<h3>通訊</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是個十四歲未滿的弱女，現在肄業於本村小學。我家有薄田百畝，有祖母，姑母三人皆嫁。我父是獨生子——多病，（現在我父五十二歲了，）娶妻二人，長無子女，我母祇生我一人，別無兄弟姐妹，唉！因處在這惡劣而又僻塞的鄉村間，像我們這樣一個弱女子，誰會拿我當個人看呢？尤其鄉間的惡俗，如果那家沒有男子，（有女也就不作數）就得由近房的侄輩承嗣，我祖母就懷有這種思想，因我父無子，家產橫竪是別人承　，故想盡量的幫助姑姑家，因此家庭間時有口角。幸我父雖是多愁多病，而腦子卻很清楚，所以叫我入校訊書，我也很歡喜訊書，並計書呌我最低限度需讀到中學畢業為止。唉！所怕的是我父冬病之身，恐難如願——。我寫到這裏，不禁熱淚奪眶而出了。慈心的先生！請閉目思之，如果我父設有不測，祖母恐不作主，我母又是個舊式的女子，以我十四歲之　女，怎麼應付一羣兇狼似的　人　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　能談及生升學呢？先生你讀了我這生命史，就明白我的隱痛了！我現在請先生答覆的是：我們女子眞能承嗣嗎？如果近房用武力承嗣，我當如何辦法？</p>
<p>此外我畢業以後，當入什麼學校，亦請先生告訴我。　羽僊鵠候</p>
<p>（答）現在的法律已許女子有財產繼承權，將來繼承開始的時候，令尊的遺產，應該由令堂和女士繼承。又現在法律廢棄宗祧繼承，如果你的父母不願收養養子，族人不得强行承嗣，如果族人　於舊習，强迫入繼！可求法律救濟。如果你的父母願意收養養子，將來那個養子的財產繼承分，是你的財產繼承分的二分之一。（律師濮舜卿答）</p>
<p>羽僊女士：</p>
<p>來信所問的法律部分，已由濮舜卿律師解答如上，至於你的升學問題，我以為小學畢業，當然只有進中學，以求基本的知識，至於進那一個中學好，還望就近打聽。再會敬祝努力　　　　　　　　　　編者</p>

<h3>提出問題與解決問題</h3>
<p>— 慎之</p>
<p>人類的生活可以設完全是在問題中打滾。個人，社會，乃至全部人類歷史，都是拿問題的提出和解決來作為它的發展過程的。比如說，在人類之長期的歷史演進中，在自然方面，既不斷的提出了物體何以會下落，它為甚麼有冷有熱，光，電是甚麼，地球，太陽從何而來等問題，又作了引力使物下落，分子振動生熱，光電是以太波等等解答，遂構成了人類對自然界之認識的科學發達過程。在社會方面，在遠古的社會裏就提出了兩性鬥爭問題，繼之而起的又有奴隸問題，更有近代的勞働問題；而一般的婚姻問題，各時代的社會制度，政治法律，生產與其分配，交換，管理等等問題，其被提出與隨之而解決的過程，就成為全部社會生活發展史。在個人的生活之流中呢？從青年時代就有求學問題，婚姻問題的提出；及至成人時期，又有私的生活方面之每日的衣食住的問題，職業問題向你攔擾；社會生活方面，亦有如何參加社會活動的，對它應盡些甚麼責任，應從它那裏求得些甚麼東西等等問題，而這些問題的提出和不斷的解決便是個人的生活史。如此，則我說個人，社會和其歷史都是以提出問題和解決問題為其過程，是不過分的。</p>
<p>但是，一切問題是怎樣提出來的，又是怎樣解決下去的呢？這裏就有着兩派顯然對立的學說作着各自不同的解答。有一部分人認為一切問題之被提出，乃是完全根據人類主觀的精神智慧之發展。比如對於自然之認識過程，是單純的求知慾的衝動所要求的結果，即只是由於人類主觀上任意地起着以疑問，追求解答，就提出了對於自然科學和哲學上的認識問題。對於社會，是由於許歷史上的偉人學者，主觀地任意地對於現有的生活方式，社會的制度，法律，社會風俗，習慣等等感覺不滿，便自由地追求着新的生活，憧憬新的社會，提出了新的問題並要求解決這些問題。至於一切問題的解決呢？也是一樣。在這一派人看來，對於自然之科學哲學的認識的進步，許多問題的正確解答，乃是學者，偉大的科學家和思想家自由發明的，所以一般地把自然科學的進步歸之於偉大的科學家的天才創造。在社會生活的演進上，他們對於制度，法律的改革，思想的變遷，都是一概歸之於偉人們的天才，以為由他們想出了好的制度，方法時，社會就依着他們的圖樣改良進步了。一句話，人類的前進時思想的指導作用，歷史是偉人創造的，自由的精神支配着世界，領導着社會和歷史前進。這一派的觀點，通常把它呌做觀念論的觀點。</p>
<p>和這種觀點正相對立的，便是客觀的歷史哲學的觀點。在這派學說看來，無論是對於自然界與社會的問題的提出和解決，都不是個人主觀上的思想之自由創作，乃是由於社會的生產發達到一定程度而必然發生的。憶秦娥問題的提出，是要社會的生產條件發達到可以提出那些問題時，甚至已經在那裏存在得有那些問題時，這問題才會發生。至其解決的方法和條件，也是存在於生產條件之中。人們自己是不能從純粹主觀方面提出問題，也不能自由地想出解決的辦法來，並有效地使問題得着解決。思想上的問題之發生和能獲得解決，乃是客觀的反映，甚至要那些問題已經達到發生與解決的可能時，人們才能去考慮它和解決它。比如說，在自然科學上，熱是物質還是一種能力與運動形態，能力是不是可以轉換的這一問題，在生產技術還沒有發達到蒸汽機的發明，熱機關的運動時，人們是不會懷疑熱素說，也不會提出熱為能力與運動形態之一，能力可以轉換那種假想的。當然，那時更無法去解答這一問題，而實證出熱為運動形態，一切能力是互相轉換的。在社會上，若近代生產尚未發達，不需要勞力自由買賣，不需要工商業之自由經營，那也不會對於古代奴隸制度，　制主義發生不滿，而追求近代的工銀制度和民主政治，並以此作為解決的辦法，實際地依這種理想去改革了舊的社會。總之，在這一派的觀點看來，提出問題的是社會自身，解決問題的也是社會自己在那裏想辦法造機會，人們不過是從中加力推動而已，不是人的思想指導社會，並對它提出問題，為它解決問題，而是社會決定人的思想，給人們提出問題，使他照社會的規定去解決問題。</p>
<p>不但如此，問題的提出與解決，因為它不是屬於人類主觀的事體，而是社會的，所以一方面，只有社會的動的發展過程中，才能發生問題，問題也才能被解決，他方面更要有人類自己的實踐，才能發生問題，解決問題。例如我們上面所舉的熱的認識之變遷，不但對於熱素說的懷疑與追求熱之本質的問題的提出，是生產發達變化的結果，而正確地認識了熱的本質之熱力學法則，也是生產前進到一定階段的結果，並且是人類在勞動的實踐中才碰到的問題，也是在繼續發達生產窒碍時，發生了問題，這時就得以人的力量去推動它前進，問題也才能被解決。如果人類沒有推動歷史的實踐活動，歷史停留着不動不發展，那麼根本就沒有社會問題產生，當然也不能解決問題。</p>
<p>問題的發生和解決，是運動與發展中的矛盾作用的結果，而問題的發生和解決，又是製造矛盾的。因為必須前在的現實的東西不能適應變動中的新發展，所以才有問題發生，而一個問題的解決，則是對於前在的現實的東西之一種反逆或取消，即否定。如此則這兩者都是矛盾的結果，是很明白的。又因為問題發生於矛盾中，所以問題一成立就是矛盾的存在，而問題的解決雖然似乎克服了矛盾，但因為歷史還在前進，所以又在這解決中造就了新的矛盾，於是問題的提出與解決又是成立矛盾製造矛盾的。照這樣說來，那麼人類社會又何　有此問題之提出和解決呢？關於這點，不但因為它是客觀的，我們無法擺脫，並且矛盾是前進的要件，一個問題提出來了又被解決下去，就造成社會的進步。想在無矛盾中生活，就是說在靜止的無進步的狀態中生活，這是不能解決問題的。問題之被提出了又被解決下去，既是人類進步的要素，則凡是想在生活上，社會上不發生問題，而能安然地過下去，這不但是不求進步的墮落思想，而且是一種幻想，就是在客觀上也不允許我們這樣的。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>鄉村絲匠</h3>
<p>— 間</p>
<p>蠶絲業普遍的某省，便是我的故鄉。不過我家沒有桑田，祗有屁股那麼大兩塊菜地，也沒有寬敞的蠶室，祗有鴿籠似的三間茅屋，因此我家就沒有「蠶絲業」。但是全家人的生活，仍靠「蠶絲」維持：爸爸幫別人挑桑葉，媽媽給別人繅絲（俗稱「取絲」），——她是有名的女絲匠，附近各養蠶大戶的春繭，夏繭（俗名「洋繭」）大都由她抽成黃絲，白絲。媽媽出門給別人取絲，總愛帶我一道：起初我不過想混兩碗飯吃，隨後便給她充副手了。在這家學淵源之下，很容易使我成就一個「小絲匠」：七八歲時便能鑑定煮繭的火色，搭頭也是百發百中了。</p>
<p>那時恰當民國八九年間，生絲賣得起價，有田土的人家都趕快栽桑預備養蠶，原有桑田的更孵大批的蠶種。這時是「女絲匠」的黃金時代：這家請過去，那家請過來，每逢春繭「下樹」（即下簇），直忙到「拌桶下田」（收殼時）。別人見着媽媽太忙，總愛摸着我的頭說：「小絲匠快長大啦，長大了好單獨出門哩！」媽媽聽着這話，馬上在那疲乏的臉上添出笑紋說：「快了，快了，踩得動絲車，就要出門呢！」真的，媽媽常常私下對我說：「孩子，祗要你踩得動絲車就好了。你看手藝這麼好，偏偏我一個人取絲，你爸爸像條笨豬，再教他也學不會。看着錢拿不到手，多麼可惜呵！」—其實，「錢」呢，也不很多：一兩絲二百工錢。如果繭子好的話（鄉村的蠶簇的位置多不講究，往往一邊黑暗一邊太明亮，光綫不同，一粒繭便分出厚薄。同時繭子沒有經過適當的溫度殺蛹，到了繅絲時大都出了蛾或成蛆繭。對於繅絲都有妨礙的。），每天五點鐘光景起床繅到夜間十點鐘可得八兩，計算工錢一吊六百文。那時的銀價三吊左右，每天不過五角多工錢，但這數目在媽看來却是了不起的數字了。要知那時普遍的勞動力都很便宜，如果幫人種田，男工錢三百文。僅媽媽一天掙的錢竟勝過男子五倍，這是多麼值得興奮的事呀！</p>
<p>媽媽掙的錢多，可是她也太苦：雞纔呌二次便要起來煮繭，天還不大亮，那「軋軋」的車聲已鑚進主人們的耳膜了。左手撈繭子，右手不住的「搭頭」，右脚踩「踏板」，左脚點地成全身的支點。耳朵要聽車輪旋轉的緩慢，眼睛要注意吸緒的「龍頭」（土絲不用「磁眼」，祗有一個銅絲挽成的圓圈擋住跳　的繭子，俗稱龍頭），真是五官並用，四肢不能休息，就這麼「繅絲復繅絲」，直到夜色昏沉時纔得收工。兼之鄉村的絲車很笨重，踩起來異常費力，每到上床時總是嚷着腿酸腰痛，頭腦暈眩。然而單是疲乏倒不要緊，還有更多的痛苦哩：絲鍋放散出來的熱氣，一股一股的向臉上直衝，要不到十天，臉子就要浮腫，眼睛也要發紅，同時兩手整天泡在絲水裏，指縫間難免不給絲水腐蝕，所以每當「絲月」內，媽媽的眼睛就要生病，兩手也是整天守着絲車。要知我家沒有田產，一家五口（我還有一弟一妹）的生活，除了爸爸平時幫零工，大半要靠媽媽繅絲來維持了！</p>
<p>本來媽媽給別人繅絲，是論兩數的，每天繅多繅少並無限制，但鄉村繅絲時間祗在五六兩月，如果不趕快在這短期內多繅絲多掙錢，那以後便沒有繅絲的機會，一年的吃食就要發生恐慌了！其實我家的生活本不固定，到了荒月（一，二，三月）總是上餐不接下餐，　不過在絲業發達的民國八九年間，比較好一些而已。媽媽在這幾年中，心情好像很快樂，雖然累苦病痛老是纏在她身上，臉上也常常發現微笑的痕跡，同時當她同爸爸談話時，也可聽得歡喜的語氣。她說：「養蠶的人家一天一天的多了，絲價比往年更高。我的手藝祗有一年好似一年的，——嗯！可惜一手摸不着幾隻蒼蠅。不過，不過再等兩三年，金生就可出門了！」是的，媽媽覺得以後的手藝更要轉好，我也希望好到頂點。媽媽盼望我早點「踩得動絲車」，我也想快點長大，以便單獨出門取絲，幫着媽媽掙錢。</p>
<p>可是事實總難恰合想像：當我踩得動絲車時，媽媽的手藝大不如前幾年那麼興隆了。其實，養蠶人家依然很多，不過他們大都不取絲而出賣生繭。據說由於土絲銷路閉塞，趕不上賣繭子乾脆而又賺錢。同時城裏新設了好幾家絲廠，需要四鄉的繭子供牠繅絲，在這廠絲發達的風頭中，土絲的地盤便被掠取了。在這大規模生產的改良生絲品質的情況下，我們鄉村的「女絲匠」，「小絲匠」，便遭受了惡劣的命運：前幾年的「絲月」間，媽媽是忙得透不過氣來，現在却閒得只是在屋子裏冒火，雖然也有人喊繅絲，但祗一天兩天便工作完畢了。手藝純熟的女絲匠尚且如此冷淡，我這初初出師的小絲匠更沒有人照顧了！於是媽媽不住歎氣，我也跟着歎氣，但有什麽用呢？「歎」破了嘴巴，「氣」破了喉嚨，仍然得不着顧主！</p>
<p>生活的恐慌，逼得爸媽在我的頭上想辦法：爸打算送我學裁縫，媽硬主張送我進絲廠當學徒。爸爸的理由是裁縫這項手藝，四季都不放空。媽媽覺得進絲廠當學徒出路很大，將來出了師當匠人，便可領工資，分紅利。爸爸究竟爭不過媽媽，結果我是鑚進了「興隆廠」，當了一名起碼的「學徒」，預備完成媽媽的願望——「領工資」，「分紅利」。</p>
<p>可是命運似乎故意同我作對，三年學徒還未滿師，興隆廠便不「興隆」，而且關門大吉了！在那四百多工匠學徒紛紛出廠的混亂中，我也抱着悲傷的心情回到鄉村。走到家裏一看，媽媽那架古老的絲車，已經積上很厚的灰塵，將要當做柴燒了！</p>
<p>廠絲，土絲一夥兒衰敗，可憐我那靠「蠶絲」吃飯的家庭，幾乎陷於破碎。所謂「女絲匠」，「小絲匠」，都給車輪扔出絲業以外了！</p>
<p>名人傳記</p>
<h3>托翁的生平</h3>
<p>— 史瑩</p>
<p>「托爾斯泰」，這個偉大的名字，幾乎將與人類的歷史同存亡了。他於一八一八年在俄羅斯的討腦省呱呱墜地。他是貴族家庭裏的孩子，排行第三。八歲時就沒有了父母，依靠親戚撫養成人。</p>
<p>一八四三年他進加桑的大學，可是他犯了一般天才者一樣的毛病，他不肯用功讀書，行為也放浪不羈，差不多完全是頑劣學生的典型。過了四年請求退學，同年秋天，再進彼得堡大學念書，過不了三個月，又趕不上去了。這時他每天把賭博來打發他的日子，很想能加入衛戌軍的馬隊中去過生活。這時，雖然他對於學校功課沒有多大興趣，但其他各種雜書却看得很多，尤其在無數著作中，認識了盧梭的學說和耶穌的登山實訓。</p>
<p>這可說是托爾斯泰的前期生活，也可說是托爾斯泰的放浪時期。</p>
<p>後來，他的哥哥在高加索駐軍中任砲兵士官，托爾斯泰在苦悶和貧窮的交迫下，就跟了他的哥哥同去高加索。高加索，有偉大美麗的風景，很給了他一點愛慕自然的啟示。他入伍以後，並沒有發跡的機會，又和軍官感情不洽，對現下生活感到非常疲乏。恰巧米里米之戰開始了，他就加入火綫，衝鋒陷陣，頗著勤勞，但戰後上級軍官並不因他的勳勞而提高他的職位，他在憤慨之中便決然引退。</p>
<p>這時候，他苦悶極了，幾乎是一個意志非常頹廢的人了。在百無聊賴的生活之中，他走向足以自慰的文學之途上去，這是托翁文藝生涯的嚆矢。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰是一個很歡喜遊覽的人，大川名川，常有他的足跡。少年時代，曾出國兩次，歸國後回到故鄉與他的姑母同居。托氏的教育興趣很濃厚，且是盧梭的信仰者，他也主張自然教育。一八五九年他同他的大哥出國考察各國國民教育，明年冬，大哥死在路上，參觀的事只得中止。一八六一年五月回國，在「治安判事」，專門管理地主和農奴間糾紛的裁判。任職近一年，秉着中正的態度，為他們排解一切，任勞任怨，費盡苦心，他感於這種職務的困難，就稱病辭職。從此專心致力於教育事業，自己在各處辦了好幾個學校，又辦了一種討論教育問題的雜誌。他的教育哲學是自然，自由，他認為自然是好的，所以我們應該復歸自然，不可束縛，不可強迫。這和盧梭在愛彌兒中的思想，頗相符合。但沒多久，教育事業因病中輟，託翁乃離家往撒馬拉去。</p>
<p>他想索利亞伯斯女士求婚是一八六二年九月十七日的事。結婚後十五年中間，他享盡了家庭的安樂，且得賢慧的夫人之助，文學事業在這十五年中真有偉大的成就。索利亞</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>伯期女士差不多是托翁最好的書記，據說托翁鉅著「戰爭與和平」一書，經過七次的删改，淸謄的工作，就是他夫人一手之力。一八六九年，托翁精究哲學，深受叔本華悲觀派的影響。後來又從事敎育，開學校，編課本，又因積勞成疾，不得不休養。正在這時期中，俄國境內，大鬧飢荒，於是他禪精竭慮，募集損欵，以資救濟，由是引起了他研究經濟問題的興趣。</p>
<p>這位文學巨匠，在這時又有多種作品問世，他在文壇上的地位，可說是已登峯而造極，但他的思想卻突然在這時轉變了。他放棄他的一切主張，一切理想，反對一切娛樂。他主張簡單生活，崇奉施捨的敎育，刻苦自奉，他完全成了人道論者，耶穌的信奉者。他這種突然的澈悟，在他的「懺悔」一書中，以自傳的體式，有詳明的叙述。他的活動範圍，規範於宗敎中了，而對於文學的前途，幾至全部放棄。</p>
<p>托為的放棄文學生涯，實是他的不幸，也是世界文壇的不幸，世人對此無不惋情，他的畏友屠格　甫在臨終的時候，還在病榻上寫了一封灼見肺腑的信，勸他重返文壇，從事於筆桿生活。托翁因感於知友誠摯的忠言，又因創作慾的強烈，在他花甲左右的高齡，尚能寫出非常有力量的作品，老當益壯，實足嚇倒一般文人。有人譽他的文思有如開不盡的金礦，信然！</p>
<p>托翁的夫人索利亞伯斯女士，十八歲時和托氏訂婚，婚後不僅給予托翁精神上無窮的安慰，就是在事業上也有不可磨滅的報助。可是天才者大多不大配做良人的，並且他們兩人的意見不相一致，同居了十年，漸漸的，各人個性都暴露了，晚年時，終不免出於離居之一途。托翁思想轉變，把精力交付與宗教之後，尤與他夫人的實知主義太相逕庭。</p>
<p>托氏後期的思想很厭惡物質文明的種種腐敗。</p>
<p>他年齡已高了，他愈恨婦人了，他也怕音樂。他自己已有了十三個子女了，是有着這樣家庭地位的人，仍大肆攻擊婚姻與家族的制度，這也是他生平有興味的事。</p>
<p>晚年，他過着最凄凉的日子，一方面他的理想離他更遠了，一方面，他的思想使他成為一個孤立的人，他與家人衝突，他與世人衝突，並且，他也常與自己衝突。他常常自陷於矛盾之中，「凄凉的暮景」，就送着這位世界大文豪完結了他的一生！</p>
<p>托氏有生之日，幾無日不在著作中過着生活，最可佩服的，在他死前四日才停止了他的日記。</p>
<p>一九一〇年十一月二十日晨六時，一代文豪托爾斯泰在亞斯波浮與世人永別了。他死得很安詳。舉殯之日，各處去送葬的人不計其數，可見托翁的精神，是怎樣感動着世人啊！</p>

<p>賭，在廣東這姻地方，的確像家常便飯一樣的已形成了生活要素之一；所以不管男女老幼，見了賭總沒有不笑逐顏閒地擺出一副興奮的表情出來參加。因此賭的機會，在這裏可說是終年不斷的；祗要你有錢，隨時隨地都有賭的對象。</p>
<p>從九龍半島出發，乘着一段路程的廣九鐵路的火車就到了那廣東有名的賭城寳安縣了。在那裏可以看到許多失意的政客，官僚，紳士，買辦，大腹賈和貴族化的太太小姐們，一個個都擺出全副的精神，挾着鉅額的金錢到這東方的「蒙脫卡羅」來决定他們的運命。</p>
<p>這裏的賭場，總共有二十多家。每一個賭場都用葵葉蓋起幾座高棚，拖長得像火車般地昆連起來；在這賭場的迦圍有滿種着奇卉異草的花園，有終年開演的粵劇戲院，有供賭客游湖的畫舫。物質上的享受可以說是色色俱備的了。</p>
<p>這裏賭場的性質，簡直可以說是變相的商業資本的交易機關；每個賭場的資本，至少有幾十萬到幾百萬。他們拿着這樣龐大的資本，來經營這種賭的事業，一般不明白內容的人，不免會笑他們愚蠢；其實，祇要到賭場裏去了三天，就會曉得他們這種「賭業」的賺錢，是任何商業也沒有這樣的豐厚。</p>
<p>在這許多葵棚裏的賭場，有「番攤」，「輪盤」「牌九」，「搖攤」，五花八門的賭具；來賭的賭客是可各盡所好隨意揀一種賭具，和賭場裏賭輸贏的。</p>
<p>「番攤」的賭法是在一張長方檯子上堆着許多像衣服鈕子般大小的「斜子」，由攤官抓上一把當衆擺在檯子上面，再用一個銅盤子蓋着。「攤官」兩隻袖子高高捋起，手裏握着一根很精緻光滑的尺許長的篾片，昂然坐着；檯子兩邊坐着四個「荷官」專司賠錢和收錢的職務。在「攤官」後面，就坐着兩個「望淸」，這種人祇專門注意賭客下注的多少和安放的地方；如果偶然的發生了糾紛，這就得「望清」的下來解决。在這樣二張賭　上，至少是要十個人才够分配職務；各人都有一定的專責，各盡所能的忠於他的職務。</p>
<p>當一個賭客走到這一，張檯子邊上來時，便馬上有一個服裝很入時的靑年「招待」過來，堆着滿臉的笑拿姻擦自來矢，很有禮貌的招待賭客坐了；接着茶房就端上茶或汽水和各種點心，像上供般的擺了一檯面。</p>
<p>「攤官」把一把「料子」抓起放在桌子上，兩邊的「荷官」就張着嘴喊：「一·好擺了！」「喂！三·也好哩！」像大拍賣的門市廣告員般地漲粗了脖子望着每個賭客的臉上喊着。「攤官」顯着很沉靜的態度，打量着每一個賭客，眼晴猶如催眠家般的銳利。</p>
<p>賭客的臉上，隨着不同的心理輸變着各種的顏色，各人的視綫電似的一齊集中到銅蓋上面：一把一把的紅綠「籌碼」，像抓黃豆般的滿不在乎地朝檯子中間送着。「荷官」站起來把賭客的下注，一注一注地點好；接着噹噹噹……電鈴一饗，停止了賭客的下注。「攤官」就在鈴聲響過之後，把銅蓋揭開，手裏拿若篾片把「料子」四顆一下地四顆一下地數着；數到最後剩下的幾顆，就算開出什麼，單數「進寳」，雙數「出寳」，賭客按着開出的數目和賭場互定勝負。</p>
<p>下注的規矩，起碼是一元，愈下得多，賭場愈加歡迎。下一元注，如果是獨門，就可以贏到三元；有的一元下「二」「三」兩門，要是開出的是「二」，祇可贏到兩元，開出來的是「三」，就互無勝負。</p>
<p>賭「牌九」卻較簡單。一張長方檯子一邊坐着賭場的五個人；當中坐着「莊家」，兩邊坐着一個「吃注」和一個「賠莊」，還有「望淸」的兩個人高高地坐着；四隻眼睛像電炬般地照着。「牌九」的下注起碼一元。五元以上，如果是賭客贏了，「莊家」就要抽頭一角；下注愈下得多，抽頭也就抽得重了。</p>
<p>在這裏，推「牌九」的規矩　却非常的嚴格；每一方由一個賭客代表拿牌，很公開的擺在桌上，前後四張怎樣的配法，凡是賭客都有權利參加意見，有時遇到疑難問題，「莊家」也可以代出主意。因為這裏配牌都有一定的規矩，就是「莊家」見了賭客的配法，也不會變更他固定的主張。所以在這裏緒「牌九」的客人，比別種賭的部門要熱鬧得多了。</p>
<p>不過，賭輪盤的人，卻是一些貴族階級；一夜的輸贏，常是三五萬元數目；有時十幾萬的輸贏，也是一件司空見慣的事實。</p>
<p>輪盤賭的工具，是一座比留聲機還大的輸盤，像車輪般的迅急的轉着。輸盤裏面裝成三十八個空格，每格寫着一個號碼，從一號到三十六號，另外還有兩格雙圈和單圈，輪盤的組織，就是這三十八門。下注起碼是一元一門，但下這樣少的數目，卻是不多見的。這種賭的輸贏，比這裏一切賭的方式都要高出幾十倍的數自；如果一元打中了一個號碼，就有得三十六元的希望。</p>
<p>開場的時候，先由莊家把電鈴一撳，全場的賭客的精神都驟然的緊張起來；一注一注的顏色「籌碼」，朝那劃着紅黑號碼的方塊裏安放。等到客人的「籌碼」擺好了，這才由莊家把一顆光滑的彈子，擦的一聲朝盤一轉；於是嘶嘶的響聲扣着每個賭客的心弦。最後，嘩啦一聲，彈子落到一個格子裏，許多賭客又不約而同的豎起耳朶，聽着「荷官」報告的號數，接着就是一陣歡笑和一陣嘆息的聲響，充滿了葵棚的四週。</p>
<p>這種一與三十六之比的賭法，吸引得一般的賭客卽使傾家蕩產也還是要沉迷於這行門道；因為這種賭法，贏上三萬兩萬，是極其輕鬆平常，可是呌你一晚上輸掉十萬八萬，也是一瞬間都可辦到的。但一般賭客下注的結果，輸給賭場的時候，總是佔絕對的多數；原因是一個賭場一天要三千多塊錢的開銷，都是要靠這班豪華的賭客來供給這筆鉅大的欵項的。</p>
<p>這種賭場組織，差不多可以說是正當的商業機關也還沒有他那樣的健全；他這裏簡直是有銀行般的精神，卻不具銀行的形式。賭客到這裏賭錢，先得要買票入場；有的是十元或五十元，那都要看賭場範圍的大小而定。當賭客走進去時，就拿出十元或五十元交到櫃上，在都裏換好一張「代幣券」；賭客拿了這種券走到裏面就可以隨意下注，不管輸贏如何，賭了一次之後，在那張賭檯上就可掉回現洋，這是賭場限制一種沒有錢的人也要走進場裏亂撞的方法。但是去過三次以上的賭客，門口招待就認得很淸了；以後不僅可以不必買券入場，並且還要替賭客代付車賬。</p>
<p>另外還有種引誘賭客的方法，簡直巧妙得不可思議，譬如一個賭客身邊帶的錢輸光時，賭場裏有的是「當店」，儘客人所有的都可拿進去抵押；不過當的成本，往往不及外面當店所付的三分之一，利錢卻特別地來得重大。如果客人當得了本錢進去贏了，回頭來贖，當時所付的利息就更要加倍；如果輸了，等到你明天來贖取時，少不了又得大賭一次的，這還是引誘男賭客的方法。對於女賭客還要高妙，輸急了當東西，這是當然的現象；還有更進一步的，就是一般意志薄弱的婦女，到輸得無路可走時，就不免拿着自己的肉體在賭場裏出賣。賭場裏預備的有不少的精緻的房間，專供這類女賭客作最後孤注一擲的場合</p>
<p>總之，賭場裏對於賭客的物質生活享受，可以說是供應得無微不至了；吃的，喝的，玩的，樣樣具備，甚至連性的問題，祇要有錢，隨時都可以在那裏解决。同時為要增厚吸引賭客的力量，又用了不少的女招待，招待得一般緒客服貼的在那裏報効；有時也有一些賭客祗是「醉翁之意不在酒」的賭着，目的物是在女招待而不在金錢，可是賭場裏卻總是有益無損的有着大批的進賬。</p>
<p>這東方的「蒙脫卡羅」，簡直是一座理葬靑年男女的「人間地獄」啊！</p>
<p>科學叢談</p>
<h3>生和死</h3>
<p>— 崇德</p>
<p>生和死這兩件事，看來是很明白了然的，但科學地考察起來，卻也是很不易理解的兩個問題。在物質的範圍，我們似乎可以這樣說，凡是有生命的物體，呌做生物，無生命的物體，就呌做死物。但這樣的解說，實際上不過是辭句的反覆而已，說了等於沒有說。因為甚麼呌做生命，怎樣才算犖有生命的物體，怎樣又呌做無生命的物體，依然是待說明的問題。對於生命之具體的解釋，是有許多不同的說法的，這裏我們宜略舉幾個來加以考察罷。</p>
<p>有人把生命這樣東西，看做是宇宙中永恒不變的，永遠存在於宇宙中的。如果照這種說法推論起來，那麼生命是宇宙中的形而上的特殊因子，牠和下乘的物質體可以分離，現有的生物，當不過是這種生命借作形象的寄託與表現的東西，是暫時的寓所而已。因為現有的有形的生物，並不是永恒存在的，牠只在地球進化到一定階段才發現，生命旣是永恒的，則沒有這有形的生命物質體之前，和這種物質體消滅以後，生命仍然存在，是當然的。如此，則生命云云，不過是一種非物質的特種精靈而已，有生命的物質與無生命的物質之間，其區別並不在有機與無機物之物質實體本身，而在一切下乘的物質之有形死塊，是否注入有這種精靈特質而已。照這樣說來，生物自身是無所謂生死的，所謂生死不過是這精靈的生命特質，在死塊的有形的下乘物質間的一個出入，和生命繼續或不繼績把這東西當作寓所而已。這種說法是宗敎的信仰，野蠻人所發明的靈魂不死，人死了鬼魂仍繼續生存的說法，乃至柏拉圖和許多類似這種哲學的學說，都可歸於這一預。而這種說法之無稽，也是用不著駁斥的。</p>
<p>又有人拿新陳代謝作用和感應與反射作用來區別生物與死物。他們認為凡能和體外行一種物質的交替作用，在外面吸取新的物質進來，把體內的舊的物質排出去，或者一遇外界物質與之相接觸，施一種作用給它，它卽能起一種反應變化的，就呌生物。反之便是死的物質。但是，「新陳代謝的本身，卽使沒有生命也是可以存在的。」因為在化學變化裏，一種物質之在適當條件下吸收外界的新原素與之化合，又放出原有的原　使之獨立存在或與別種物質化合，</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<h2>Page 31</h2>
<p>是很普通的。又若把無機體浸潤於液汁中，那麽它的外皮吸取一部分液體分子入自己的組體中，而自己脫落一些分子下去，也是常有的。至於感應與反射嗎？雖然無機界的威應與反射和生命體的感應與反射作用，是有着某種程度和意義上的差別，但這也不是根本的區別。因為在適當條件下某些原素碰在一起，馬上起結合與分解的感應和反射活動，電磁之交互戚應與反撥，以及我們打擊任何物體之一部分，它不但直接生着抗拒作用，而且還會震動到全體分子起作不同的運動呢。</p>
<p>然則究竟要怎樣才能分別出生物與死物呢？節單地說來，生命如果在純自然科學的立塲上說，乃是「蛋白物的存在形態」。自然，原形質才是生命物質的基礎，但原形質之所以能成為生命物質的基礎，乃是由於牠大部分包含着蛋白質。蛋白質在有機物質中有一種特殊的作用，這種作用雖然仍是在一般的新陳代謝法則下，行着它那吸取周圍物質把它同化，而將個體中舊的東西徘出去的過程，但牠和金屬酸化，岩石風化等僅僅類似的變化作用是不相同的。因為這些物質的那種變化是其自身破壞的原因，而在蛋白質中却成為自己更新之生存必要條件。因為如此，所以我們能看到有生命存在時就有蛋白質，及至蛋白質腐敗破壞，其作用停息，於是原形質也死亡了。如此，則所謂生命物質就是具有蛋白物的物體，而死的物質卽是沒有具有那種東西的物體了。細胞是以細胞核和原形質與細胞膜三部分搆成的，而最原始的細胞甚至連細胞膜都沒有；原始的生物就以一個細胞成為一個獨立的生命。那麽如像那種生命的個體之死就是蛋白物的破壞，而共生則是蛋白物的存在，是很明白的。</p>
<p>但是，也正因為如此，所以在高等的多細胞生物中，生死的界綫遂弄得不易明瞭了。因為比如拿人來說，每一分鐘一秒鐘都在行着整體內部的新陳代謝，加吸進新物質組成新細胞，又排去死細胞。據科學的研究，人在七年之中全身細胞都要換　，如此，則你說人在甚麽時候才能算生呢？說得遠點，他從精　細胞，卵子細胞存在起，就已經有了這種生命的胚種了，說得近一點，則繼續長成一直到老死時，又尙在生着新細胞，這生便難確定。又甚麽時候才算死呢？縱不說人之一生細胞要全換若干次，就是說要死若干回，卽以正式的死來說；也不是剎那問的事，他在不斷的衰老時早在開始死了，斷氣以後，也還要經過若干時細胞才能死完啊！於是死也是難於確定的了。如此，則生與死在生物中實在不能劃一絕對的界綫，生的起點就有死，就是死，死的起點也就有生，就是生。雖然如此，但我們也不要忘記一個多數細胞組成的生命體，因其量的積累有着不同的特質那件事。卽如人，在以多數細胞搆成人以後，人是有個整體的有機關聯之統一的生命特點的，這時再不能以單一細胞之生死法則去包括盡他們的生命之生死。所以這時我們要確定人的生的界綫，是應當以精虫和卵子細胞之結合與開始發育為起點的。因為在未結合前精虫和卵子細胞不能單獨發育為人，那時雖仍是一個生命，但不算人的生命之開始，可是一經結合發育起來，牠就具有了必然長成的可能之人的生命了。在長成過程中，雖然不斷的有着舊細胞之死亡，甚至七年內要全體死亡一次，但這死亡並沒有傷害到人的整個生命之結節點，這是不能算作最終的死的。到了一旦斷氣僵臥，雖然其中部分的細胞尙沒有完全死去，但由牠們組成的全部有機機能之生命結節點是已經破壞無餘的了，這當然可以算得正式的死的。這種生與死之區分與判斷，我們一定要用部分要包括於全體中，全體也包括於部分中那種思維法去看。卽部分與全體是綜合地並存並亡的，部分的死不損及全體的生不算死，全體的死已成熟，卽使部分的生還有生存着的仍不能算生。自然，如果沒有部分的生也不會有全體的生，沒有部分的死也是沒有全體的死的。這可以說是科學的生死觀。</p>

<h3>沒落（二）</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>一會兒，阿福托着一個木盤進來，盤裏放着四碗小菜，母親連忙走過去很仔細地一樣樣的朝桌子上擺着，接着又把湯匙筷子拭過一遍，說：「坤兒！吃飯罷。一個整天，又是火車輪船的，肚子想也餓了！」</p>
<p>「不，我在火車上吃過飯的。」心裏好像放着一塊石頭似的，一點也沒有感到肚子餓的恐慌，不過當時我却不便說出，祇推說是早在火車上吃了。</p>
<p>「火車上吃了？那是不會飽的。再吃點，這裏有「家鄉肉」哩！」母親拿着筷子夾起一塊半生半熟的鹹肉放在吃飯的碗上。</p>
<p>「少爺：這肉還是開頭呢！快吃，等些就會冷了！」阿福裂着嘴笑了。</p>
<p>「你們都吃過了晚飯麽？」經不起母親和他們殷動的逼促，我勉强地端起碗來吃了。</p>
<p>「都吃了！」母親搶着說。</p>
<p>「這麼早就吃了？從前一天吃三頓，現在也還是嗎？」看着他們那種營養不足的臉孔，着實引起了我的懷疑。</p>
<p>「是……還是像從前一樣的。」母親說話的聲昔有點顫抖了。</p>
<p>大家的臉上跟着浮上了一層苦笑，不自然的從鼻腔裏哼了一聲，勉強地把我說的話敷衍過去了</p>
<p>「祖堂」裏一會兒靜寂下來，像冰窖似的沉靜得可以聽出每個人的心都在急促的跳着；我默然的低着頭瞅着碗裏的飯顆慢吞吞地咀嚼着，心裏老是覺得像個待决的囚犯似的，對着那許多吐着飢餓的眼光感到不安起來。</p>
<p>「坤兒，你快點吃罷；當心冷了吃了又要喊肚子痛的。孩子，呆想些什麼？」母親臉上透着慈祥而又憂鬱的神情，接着說：「阿福！你拏這碗肉湯去呌三嬸子再燒一下罷？喔！火車上的飯是吃不飽的。——唔！你們也好去睡了，弄到這早晚大家也累得慌，那椿事祇好明天再說吧？唉！……」母親掉轉身望着他們這樣說了，偷偷地拏起衣裳角往臉上凑着。</p>
<p>「唔…」大家祇輕微地應了一聲，都像肩上壓着的一副担子放下來了似的　了口氣，一個個地苦着臉望我笑了笑走出「祖堂」了。</p>
<p>「少爺！熱湯來了；飯也掉一碗熱的，冷的吃不得呀！」阿福托了一碗熟氣升騰的肉湯進來。</p>
<p>「不要了，肚子吃得太飽倒不舒服。」我望着搖了搖頭。</p>
<p>「瞎說！火車上的飯吃不飽的，再吃點。」母親說着連忙站起身來，把湯往我碗裏倒了；喝點熱湯罷，飯冷了不要吃了。</p>
<p>我埋着頭一口一口喝着，阿福福看在眼裏却得意的笑了，說：「少爺，老奶奶多喜歡你啊！你沒有回來，老奶奶那一天沒把嘴裏唸乾！」</p>
<p>我看着他得意的樣子，卻忍不住的笑了。</p>
<p>「唉！我倒不是天天想他回來，眞的回來了又有什麼做呢，這樣的荒年？我總想他在外面多賺點錢，將來好成房家，舒舒服服的過着日子；像他爸爸要是年輕時肯積點錢的話，今天也不會……」母親說得傷感起來，但說到父親的事又突然地把話掩住了。</p>
<p>「是囖！沒有女人是不行的。」阿福歛住了笑容抑着嘴說。</p>
<p>「姆媽！爹爹怎麽這早晚還不回？家裏出了什麽事吧？」我霍地走到母親面前釘住她問着。</p>
<p>她的灰暗的眼睛吐着不安的苦惱的神情、頻頻地搖着頭安慰我說：「沒有什麽大不了的事，一會兒就會回來的。」她說着瞅了阿福一眼。</p>
<p>「阿福！老板（註：長工對男主人的稱呼）是幹什麽去的，你不晚得麽？」我厲聲的問着。</p>
<p>阿福抓着頭皮，顯出很困難的樣子瞥了母親一下說：「老奶奶！吿訴少爺罷？」</p>
<p>他說着又抓了一下頭皮，繼續地說：「老板是到鎭上伍太爺家裏去的，今天大早就去了：剛才長根回來說：「伍太爺說過了，老板要不把欠租繳淸，今年就要在「區公所」裏過年。」唔！「區公所」過年，過年也還要吃官司？含了得！」（未完）</p>

<h3>紐約與好萊塢一對大胖子的握手</h3>
<p>— 穆琳</p>
<p>最近美國紐約某家電影院裏來了一位名叫白萊地（Diamond　Jim　Brady）的大胖子，做看守院門的職務。據一般人的估測，他底肚皮簡直有普通人六倍以上的肥大。這件事不由的引起了許多紐約城裏遊手好閒和喜歡在娛樂塲所走動的人們的注意。於是遠消息便很快地傳到了好萊塢了。</p>
<p>蓋克皮（Guv　Kibbee）也是個好萊塢著名的大胖子，他聽了這個消息之後，便特地跑到紐約去了一次，會見了白萊地。適巧在他們才遇見開始談話的時候，給一位新聞記者瞧見了。這位新聞記者好奇心動，覺得這是一椿很富於興味的新聞材料，便也自我紹介和白萊地以及蓋克皮握手言歡起來。下面便是這位新聞記者寫下來和這兩位大胖子會晤後的談話。</p>
<p>據蓋克皮說，他這一生從沒看過比他更大的胖子，就是哈台先生（Olive　Hardy）也只有他四分之三大。他曾經特地請敎過一位醫生給他視騐胃部，看一天需要多少食量才爲適合。那醫生的認察，覺得他非每天比較普通人多吃三倍的食物，不足以維持身體需要的營養。可是東西吃的太多，體部卻又會更加長胖起來。這對於年老的蓋克皮又是危險的，因爲年老的胖子是格外容易中風的原故。結果這問題到底如何解決呢？那醫生關照他：每天須馀六磅至七磅的水，而且睡眠必須減少。蓋克皮便遵照地做了，可是肥胖這毛病終究不能醫治痊愈。</p>
<p>蓋克皮又說：「我在好萊塢是個很出風頭的人物。因爲我自體肥騰而又理大，所以不敢坐汽車出外，汽車的震撼往往會使我的肚子覺得酸。於是到影片公司或是交際塲所裏去，一概代以步行。而我行走在路上的時候，總時常不留神撞倒了人家，尤其是女人。也就因爲此，有許多和女人同行的男子便會和我吵嘴。甚而至於要打架。可是我卻都是婉言跟他們賠了禮完了事的。久而久之，人家也都曉得我是個胖子的緣故，所以才會時常撞翻人的。」</p>
<p>的確，假使你到好萊塢的街坊上去打藥，沒一個人不知道蓋克皮的。他們都會說：「哦，那個肥豬。」</p>
<p>白萊地是個沉默寡言的人。也許是他害羞的緣故，他對新聞記者沒有多說什麼話。只是講他從前一向總是做隱士，不敢出來鬧笑話，怕給人家故意來戲弄他。可是近來他忽然窮困得無可奈何了。於是便被他底夫人從鄉村裏硬拖了出來，要他做事找錢用。因爲白萊地食量又大，再坐著白吃究竟不是一回事的。可巧這家電影院裏物色中了他，便把他雇來了。因爲這比廣告的效力遠大，號召影迷的本能是非常雄厚的。</p>
<p>蓋克皮是個大胖子，可是和白萊地站在一起看起來，還猶如小巫見大巫呢</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「歌臺情波」</h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>Enter　Madame＿國泰</p>
<p>我想，凡是看過「歌臺事情波」的人，誰都醉心於其中的幾個塲面吧。當女伶莉莎和美國少年琪拉德結婚之後，她們倆倚儂在月夜的河邊，聽著嘹亮的情歌，那醉人的風光，充溢著浪漫的情調。其次是歌劇「Cavateria　Rusticana」的穿插，那嚴肅的敎堂中的祈禱，合唱，莉莎哀怨的心曲，以及宗敎氣氛瀰漫著整個的戲院，這使沒有宗敎信心的人們，也不能不爲之大大的感動。再其次便是莉莎偕其夫婿深花歸來，許多戲院的經理緊跟著她談生意，訂合同，莉莎夫婦雖然疲倦已極，但不能不給他們糾纏得十分煩惱。這騷亂的空氣，對照著以後她們離婚談的晚上，琪拉和僕婦廚役們敲著碗碟合唱，同樣是熱鬧，可是這顯然是快樂與悲哀不同的表現。以上諸處，都是劇中精采的表現。這些作爲這一影片代表的導演手法，整個的劇情都在熱鬧的空氣中進行著，它給與人們濃厚的歡樂與快感。</p>
<p>但是這些快感都不能給與人們充實的眞實感，原因是整個的故事只是爲故事而故事虛構起來。事實上，故事內容沒有絲毫積極性，不，就這一般舊的戲作家所風尚的人生意味的嚴肅表現，都沒有做到。所謂人生意味的嚴肅表現，並不是說喜劇不能擔負這一任務，以詼諧的態度，同樣可以表現嚴肅的人生。然而「啾台情波」卻並不如此，它祗是極輕鬆的表現著極空虛的故事。</p>
<p>一個名女伶愛上了一個富有青年，而很快的結婚了。可是丈夫卻不耐於女伶的騷擾，他所需要的乃是愛的纏綿，於是在六七個月之後，丈夫愛上了一個寡居的少婦，向女伶要求離婚。假使就從這裏開始描寫女伶失戀的痛苦，未嘗不能高度的發揮劇的情感，可是在這裏卻是女伶用了種種方法奪回了丈夫的愛情，使她們依然是喜劇的和好如初。如此俗套的處理劇情，幾瞳使我們認爲是無意識的兒戲了。</p>
<p>我們知道有些藝術作品，完全是賣弄技巧的，「歌台情波」便是如此。這正合了某種人的論調，形式是藝術作品的一切，內容反在其次。殊不知如「歌台情波」之類的作品，並不能給與人們最低限度的比較深入的感動。試問看過本片的人們，誰能有比較深刻的印象呢？即就技術上來說，除了上述的比較精采之處以外，也並不能更多的給與人們一時的興味。</p>
<p>就演員來說，飾醫生的，飾女僕的，飾廚司的，都有可愛的個性。女伶的依麗莎地，誰也不否認她是可以演戲的，可是她在這裏卻無論如何是火氣太過的。假使說這一影片環保留了舞臺戲的作風的話，便在她身上表現出來。到於男主角Gary　Grant，從來就沒有什麼深入的表演，在這裏也祗是平平盡職而已。</p>
<h3>「獸異」中之秘乘</h3>
<p>— 雲水</p>
<p>現在南京和映的米高梅奇麗獸片「獸異」，原名呌做「西戈耶（Sequoia），係根據於霍一德氏名著　里布」（V．J．Hoyt’s　“Mahbu’），爲歐美討論界稱作二十年來僅見的銀史奇蹟。同時該片曾經引起了外界種種推測和疑問，大都認此類影片的攝製是不可能的。的確，聚羣獸於一處，而敎之表演成劇，誠然是非常困難的。可是「獸異」斷斷乎不屬於那種「鏡頭手法」的僞品，這也是該片導演佛蘭克林氏，再三申明而有實據的。下列一些零　碎消息，我想或許可以發明那「獸異」攝製之一切過，當然亦僞一般影迷所樂聞者：</p>
<p>（一）背景　在美國西拉斯高峯High　Sierrae之西戈耶國，有森林名Sequoia　Nafional　Forsts拓地數十畝僞廣塲（按該地面積共計十八萬畝）另　小池一，而附較小廣塲二，又設一小規模之畜欄，此即該片之攝影塲也。嗣後所闢不敷應用，并因野獸皆已性馴，遂以整個森林作背景，而鏡頭之美麗奇偉，實基於此也。</p>
<p>（二）時空　攝獸片之最困難問題即僞時間問題。大概獸類恐難指揮如意，故必須等待機會，不像人類可以隨時工作。所以攝製時間，足足化了二年之久，而大部分（狠奇怪的發現）是在夜間攝取成的，並且鏡頭往往運到一萬一千呎高度上而從事工作。</p>
<p>（三）人物　這裏所謂劇中人物，當然屬於披毛戴角，生翼負甲的動物們，（雖然瓊派克是領銜的……除了二位夫人，牡鹿瑪里面，與山獅甘陀之外，還有狼種野狗Coyote，野貓Beboat，枝狸Raccoon，狼，熊與巨　（獵犬）響尾蛇，驚鴻等。可是有些認僞天生的敵人Natura　Enemies在同一哺育下，竟相依相愛絕無仇害之意。但響尾蛇終究是個例外。至於如何能夠訓練他們，而使之春水銀燈下表演，很簡單地，僅在操縱他們的食物而已。</p>
<h3>「紅粉鐵血」的重映</h3>
<p>— 雲巖</p>
<p>「紅粉鐵血」I　want　A　Spy這部片子，是描寫歐戰時候一位比國女子，怎樣關心於國家的安危和熱心於救護傷兵的工作。在歐美公映時，均曾轟動遐邇。曼達夫人Mme　Martha　Mc　Kenua在世界大戰時，曾在比國境內偵探部當過看護，建立許多奇功，當時曾有巾幗英雄之譽。這部「紅粉鐵血」，頗有許多地方，是根據她的經過事實攝製的。當該片公映後，她曾發表談話，稱讚這張片子。</p>
<p>該片去年在光陸蘭心兩家戲院同時開映，亦曾得獲極好的譽論。現在據說又將捲土重來，不日就要在巴黎開映了。</p>
<h3>「風雲兒女」中兩歌曲</h3>
<p>「風雲兒女」，是電通很富詩意與革命性的第　部有聲鉅片。以藝術的畫面，溶合著偉大的劇情；中間，更夾著纏綿凄絕的歌曲——「鐵蹄下的歌女」，以輾轉漂流的阿鳳主人美唱來，最使人感動了。還有袁牧之和老百姓合唱的「義軍進行曲」，這曲調，可以使我們從消極的生活中急進，萎靡的陷阱裏奮起，在民族危機的當前，卻是一種惕勵的興奮劑。</p>
<h3>今晨我國代表報告蘇俄影展情形</h3>
<p>此次蘇俄國際電影展覽會，參加者達二十一國，影片百二一餘部，而獲獎者只有十部。分屬中，俄，英，法，美，捷克六國。聯華公司出品「漁光曲」，僞中國獲得榮譽獎狀。我國出席代表聯華公司總發行所經理陶伯遜氏，亦於前日載譽而歸。上海各影院戲院以此次陶氏長途跋涉，勞苦功高，使中國影片揚揮異域。爲明瞭此次影展情形起見，特於今晨（三十一日）公請陶氏，在金城大戲院報告蘇俄電影展覽會經過，及蘇俄電影事業情形，邀請各界參加云。</p>

<h3>印度亡國恨（Clive　Of　India）（十五）</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>克萊夫繼續大聲說道：「但是經過了這許多年的辛勞，現在叫我來對薄公庭——剝奪我所有的一切，那是出乎我意料之外的。這亦是英國民族所不肯做的。諸位，我從良心上說話，我是無罪的。在我還沒有坐下之前，我要向諸君請求一件事——當諸君決定我的個人人權問題的時候，請諸君不要忘記了自己的人格。」</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂淚流滿面的，扶著克拉克隊長的手起了下去。勞伯特現在往那裏去？等待著眾院的判決他的罪名嗎？她連想都不敢想了。但是克萊夫不待眾院的判決，已自議塲中走了出來。艾德蒙迎接著他，和他握著手安慰著他。克萊夫手摸著自己頭上的舊傷，慘然地說道：「我亦沒有什麼可在乎的了。唉！爲什麼我要等到今天的一日呢？幾十次，一顆鎗彈，一把刀，左一寸，右一寸，都可以送了命，像一位英雄似的埋葬了，名將到此，亦正像美人遲暮，不如早死了好些」。</p>
<p>一回，他又歎了一口氣道：「我要回家了，艾德蒙——皇后廣塲，老房子裏去。」艾德蒙道：「勞伯特，現在不是可以單獨的時候了……克萊夫道：「我是一個人，沒有朋友的了。哦，不對，我太忘恩負義了」。他看了艾德蒙的臉，很懇摯地說道：「你是我最先的一個朋友，亦是我最後的一個朋友。請你……我到皇后廣塲去……」他垂頭喪氣，一步一　地走了出去。</p>
<p>克萊夫回到皇后廣塲的老宅，獨自一個人坐在大客廳裏。他坐在他常坐的大椅子裏，旁邊是一張小凳子，是瑪格勒蒂坐的。他於昏　之中，不覺伸出手來摸著旁邊的小凳，但是瑪格勒蒂已經不在了。他不覺手縮了回來，頭低了下去，閉著雙眼，祗覺得一切都成了寂寞……痛苦……失敗。他不覺喊了一聲：「這是終了的時候了……」</p>
<p>但是他話沒有說完，瑪格勒蒂已經輕移蓮步地走了進來。她的手摸著他的手，但是他一些都驚訝。當她吻著他的唇的時候，他好像回到了他們第一次見面的時候。他徐徐張開了眼睛問道：「你知道我需要你的嗎？」瑪格勒蒂道：「我知道」。克萊夫道：「一條很足的道路，崎嶇不平的道路，我們已經走完了，現在等待著末日的降臨」。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，僕了走進來，低聲稟告：總理大臣駕到了。克萊夫立即吩咐請進來。他的眼睛，受了痛苦而昏　了。他對著瑪格勒蒂道：「總理大臣夜半到此，大份兇多吉少」。他想站起來，但是他頭上的創傷，已使他腳軟如棉，站立不定了。總理大臣走了門口，就鞠著躬，稱了一聲：「勳爵夫從」瑪格勒蒂亦鞠著躬說道：「外子有病，請大人恕他不能起立」。總理又鞠著躬對著克萊夫說道：「鄙人奉英王陛下的命，來傳英王的口諭，不論眾院的判決如何，陛下個人對於勳爵的功績，是始終感激的」。</p>
<p>原來眾院大多數都覺得克萊夫的舉動，有不檢點的地方，但同時又覺得他確是有功於國家，因此設收財產的建議沒有通過。而他的名譽呢？既然英王特別加以寬慰，亦就可以不成問題的了。克萊夫於是立疾站了起來，扶了瑪格勒蒂的肩　　著總理大臣道：「請大人回去的時候，向陛下代陳一切感激之忱」。一切痛苦，已成陳跡。總理大臣走後，克萊夫生了下來，將瑪格勒蒂摟在懷中溫存鄭，如同他們第一次見面的時候一樣。（完）</p>

<h3>The Significance of Preparing for the Chinese Alcohol Factory</h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>The Chinese Alcohol Factory is the result of collaboration between the Ministry of Industries and overseas Chinese gentlemen Huang Zongxiao and Huang Jiangquan. It has been two years since its initiation, but actual preparations have taken less than a year. Trial production and delivery are still three months away. Today, we are simply taking the opportunity to invite people from all walks of life to visit the factory and hold a simple opening ceremony to commemorate the beginning of a new industry in China.</p>
<p>The establishment of a country must have its fundamental conditions and problems. The so-called fundamental conditions and problems are the minimum self-sufficiency and relatively modern defense. Neither is sufficient for establishing a country. The minimum self-sufficiency, in addition to food and clothing, fuel is indeed a very important element. Fuel for industry and transportation is the source of power and the mother of production. As long as the supply of fuel is cut off, even a little, the entire social production function and means of transportation will completely stagnate. And the dependence of modern national defense tools on fuel is even more crucial than industry and transportation. The naval bases and air force bases that must be contested in modern warfare are nothing more than guarantees of fuel supply. Since the invention of the internal combustion engine, the application of liquid fuel has indeed surpassed solid fuel. The increase in the use of liquid fuel in transportation equipment, prime movers, and military equipment is very noticeable. As General Foch said: "A drop of gasoline is a drop of blood," not only on the battlefield, but also in the development of a country's industry. The more we feel the importance of liquid fuel to a country's establishment, the more we are horrified by China's self-sufficiency problem.</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of highway transportation and the progress of aviation in China have been extremely significant. However, the fuel used by automobiles and airplanes is mostly dependent on imports. In the past five years, gasoline imports have increased from 109,000,000 liters (1929) to 117,000,000 liters (1933). Kerosene imports are even larger. The import volume in 1929 was 906,000,000 liters, and in 1933 it was also 708,000,000 liters. The value of gasoline imported annually averages around ten million customs taels, and the value of kerosene averages around fifty-five million customs taels. From this huge amount of liquid fuel imports, we can see the trend of highway transportation and aviation development, and at the same time, we can also see the degree of urgent need for liquids. China cannot be self-sufficient in gasoline, and to meet the urgent need, there is only a substitute for our gasoline. We see that countries in Europe that cannot be self-sufficient in gasoline, such as Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, all use alcohol as a partial substitute for gasoline, and each has legislation to enforce the use of alcohol-gasoline mixtures, giving us a good reference material for considering this issue, and at the same time increasing our courage and expectation to promote the alcohol industry. This is one of the main motivations for us and Huang Junshui to prepare and cooperate in establishing the Chinese Alcohol Factory.</p>
<p>In industrialized countries, alcohol is a byproduct of sugar factories. Before the sugar manufacturing industry in China is developed, the raw materials used for alcohol can only be other starchy items. According to the research results of the Central Industrial Research Institute of the Ministry of Industries, sweet potatoes and sorghum are both suitable for alcohol manufacturing and are very economical. These two agricultural products are not the main food crops and originally had very low value. Any land can be used to plant them. Using these two agricultural products as raw materials for the alcohol industry has a very beneficial effect on agriculture. On the one hand, it can increase the value of agricultural products, and on the other hand, it can be used to cultivate these two raw materials on wasteland. This is the second point in the motivation for preparing for the Chinese Alcohol Factory.</p>
<p>The Chinese Alcohol Factory has been approved by the Ministry of Industries to obtain exclusive manufacturing rights in the JiangSu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. The permission of this exclusive manufacturing right, in addition to encouraging emerging industries, has a greater significance in unified planning. The development of emerging industries often has speculative outbursts. Everyone sees that emerging industries are profitable, and regardless of the supply and demand situation of production, they rush to set up the same factories, and the result is either oversupply or cutthroat competition, which eventually leads to both sides being hurt. In the history of China's industrial development, there are really countless such examples. Alcohol manufacturing is one of the emerging industries, and it is related to national defense and fuel, so it must not be allowed to repeat the cycle of speculative outbursts and decline in the past. And to implement a controlled economy, we must first try it from the new industrial aspect. Therefore, the central government gives the Chinese Alcohol Factory the special privilege of exclusive manufacturing within a certain area and a certain period of time, hoping to create a solid foundation for the alcohol manufacturing industry under the circumstances of adapting to the supply and demand situation. We believe that the existing other alcohol factories will definitely not be adversely affected. If we can have considerable coordination and cooperation in production and operation, the entire alcohol industry can develop in a planned manner. Implementing control is the third important significance of co-organizing the Chinese Alcohol Factory.</p>
<p>The task of the Ministry of Industries in the industrial field is to promote the construction of important industries. The government can allocate funds from the national treasury to run various industries that must be state-owned, and at the same time should encourage the people to share the responsibility of industrial construction according to the government's planned plan. Alcohol factories are originally a type of government industrial plan. Since the national treasury is not abundant, it is the most natural way to cooperate with merchants and people. In the process of discussing the cooperation method, we always feel the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to build the country, and the expression of the government's sincere meeting. This is what we feel very happy and comforted.</p>
<p>The opening of the Chinese Alcohol Factory with the important significance of enriching national defense, fuel self-sufficiency, utilizing agricultural products, and controlling production can also indicate the line and direction of China's industrial development. We congratulate the success of the Chinese Alcohol Factory and at the same time inform the society of this significance.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Opening of the Chinese Alcohol Manufacturing Company: Extract the Essence and Utilize it Broadly</h3>

<h3>Benefit Broadly and Be Self-Sufficient</h3>

<h3>Panoramic View of the Chinese Alcohol Factory</h3>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>— Liu Weizhi</p>
<p>Our country's industry is backward, and all undertakings are inferior to others. In recent years, people of the country and gentlemen have jointly known the necessity of catching up quickly. The government has tried its best to promote and guide, with the expectation of close cooperation with the people, so that all production undertakings can begin to take shape. The alcohol factory is one of them.</p>
<p>The use of alcohol to meet the major needs of science is already well known. Previously, although there were small-scale manufacturing plants in the country, it was difficult to achieve perfection due to insufficient capital and equipment. The hope of development was not easy to say. As a result, the needs of industry and medicine had to be met by foreign goods. In today's world, it is truly impossible to delay the plan to actively manage to recover the lost rights and interests.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jiangquan, an overseas Chinese, has seen this, so he proposed the establishment of the Chinese Alcohol Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a joint venture between the government and merchants. Mr. Huang has been in Southeast Asia, where he has made a name for himself in the business world. He has a passion for developing the production business of his motherland, and his strength is enough to undertake this huge manufacturing industry. The government knew this, so it cooperated with him to plan and build. After a year, the factory was established. From then on, alcohol products can be widely needed, remedy leakage, and the benefits are not shallow!</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of the company's opening, I would like to record a few words as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Preparation Process and General Equipment Overview</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Alcohol is an important raw material for industry and an important solvent for industry. All medicine, chemistry, cosmetics, fertilizers, paints, rayon, artificial ivory, smokeless gunpowder, etc., require a large amount of alcohol: other uses, such as for fuel, preservatives, and blended beverages, are also in large quantities. In recent years, China's industry has gradually developed, and the need for alcohol has also increased with time. However, in recent years, most of this alcohol has been imported from foreign countries, and leakage has been huge; not only has the right to benefit overflowed, but also the needs of national defense and daily use have relied on imports, which is also a great loss of the way of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to strive to save gasoline, all countries in the world have successively implemented mandatory alcohol addition to gasoline to replace part of the fuel. In recent years, European countries have successively formulated laws to force the mixing of alcohol and gasoline, to stipulate the quantity of alcohol that oil merchants should purchase, and the composition of mixed alcohol that should be available. Even the United States, which is famous for its petroleum abundance, has also discussed the use of agricultural alcohol as liquid fuel. From this, it can be seen that the importance of alcohol in liquid fuel has become even more important in recent years. China's oil reserves are not abundant, and they have not yet been exploited. In order to seek self-sufficiency in liquid fuel, the mixed application of alcohol and gasoline is also an important plan. Therefore, the establishment of an alcohol factory is actually urgent in our country.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industries, in view of the importance of the alcohol industry, had already listed it as one of the basic industries to be established by the Ministry of Industries. Limited by financial resources and in view of the need to solve the raw material and technical problems of alcohol production in advance, it prepared to set up a factory on the one hand and engaged in research and experiments on the other. Therefore, the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industries purchased equipment for the production of alcohol and conducted detailed research on the raw materials and technologies for the production of alcohol. It also trained junior technical personnel to prepare for the establishment of an alcohol factory. After the Institute researched the production of alcohol with starch raw materials: such as sorghum, sweet potatoes, corn, etc., regarding the selection of raw materials, the degree of cooking, the quality of saccharifying agents, the amount of saccharifying agents, the time of saccharification, and whether the saccharification could be completed, it conducted long-term research and experiments, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>In order to promote the development of national defense industry and encourage overseas Chinese to return to invest, the Ministry of Industry negotiated with overseas Chinese businessmen Huang Jiangquan to start with the development of the alcohol industry first, and then other industries when it is successful. So it formulated a plan to jointly establish a factory with government and merchants. After repeated consultations, satisfactory solutions were obtained for capital, output, government shares, number, and other issues. Then, the two parties drafted a draft contract, which was submitted by the Ministry of Industry to the Executive Yuan meeting for modification and approval, and then forwarded to the Central Political Council for discussion and resolution and modification. A formal contract was signed between the two parties in October 1933.</p>
<p>According to the contract, the capital of the factory was originally one million yuan, and the government shares were one-tenth, which was borrowed by the merchant. However, later, in order to achieve the greatest efficiency, the two parties were afraid that the original capital would be insufficient, so they increased the total amount to 1.5 million yuan, and the amount distribution was still in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>After the contract was signed, active progress was immediately started. The factory site was purchased in Bailianjing, Pudong, Shanghai, with an area of 150 acres. The construction of the factory building began in May 1934. The mechanical installation was completed in mid-November and trial runs began. Manufacturing began on December 1. Distillation began on December 15. The alcohol content was 96% to 97%, and the quality was extremely pure and good. The daily output was about 30,000 liters (approximately 7,000 Imperial gallons).</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the factory building, the internal organizational situation, and various important machinery and equipment, it can be briefly described in the following categories:</p>
<p>A. Factory Building Construction The factory foundation covers an area of 40 acres. The entire factory is built with reinforced concrete and negative beams. The height of the building is nine feet and the four sides are glass windows. The roof is flat and the appearance is extremely magnificent. Next to each machine, a vacant house must be built for expansion. Therefore, the output will be doubled in the future. There is no need to build another house. All machinery can also be manufactured in the country, and the capital required is less.</p>
<p>B. Factory Organization The factory is responsible for all important administrative and product sales matters by Huang Jiangquan, general manager of Jianyuan Company. On the factory side, there are three divisions: chemistry, machinery, and affairs, which are directed by the factory director. The chemistry department has one chief chemical engineer, assistant chemical engineers, managers, and trainees. The machinery department has one mechanical engineer, assistant mechanical engineers, and managers. The affairs department has several Chinese and Western secretaries and clerks. The factory director, chief mechanical engineer, and chief chemical engineer are all employed as industrial experts from the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, and all have practical experience in managing factories.</p>
<p>In addition to hiring experienced personnel to preside over the manufacturing and analysis aspects, all staff in each department are graduates of secondary schools or above and have undergone long-term and appropriate training, so the work efficiency is higher than that of general factories.</p>
<p>C. Treatment of Employees The factory has built exquisite staff family residences for the factory director, chief chemist, chief mechanic, and other important staff. It has also built a large dormitory for the residence of staff trainees. Various sports fields and swimming pools are also being designed and built. So that staff can get physical and mental rest after work.</p>
<p>D. Equipment Summary can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Source of Machinery The machinery of the factory was ordered from Blair’s Ltd. This factory is located in Glasgow and is a world-famous chemical machinery factory, especially famous for its design of distillers.</p>
<p>(2) Types of Machinery The factory machinery can use both grains, potatoes, and molasses as raw materials. Its equipment is so complete that it is rare even in European and American countries. The important equipment is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Grain Raw Material Processing Room The room is equipped with a dust remover, sheller, screening machine, and grinder. All transportation uses bag-type or screw-type transporters.</p>
<p>2. Cooking and Saccharification Room Equipped with high-pressure cookers, saccharifiers, and coolers. The design of each machine is extremely novel, so the work efficiency is extremely high.</p>
<p>3. Germination Room The factory uses malt for saccharification of grain and potato raw materials. The malt manufacturing room uses the latest type of air conditioner, so it can also be manufactured when the weather is warm. And the area occupied by malt is also less.</p>
<p>4. Dilution Room This room is for molasses dilution and sterilization. All work is continuous. Molasses is stirred with filtered compressed air. The room is equipped with a pure yeast incubator for fermentation of grain mash and molasses mash.</p>
<p>5. Fermentation Room The factory is equipped with sixteen iron closed fermentation tanks. Each has a capacity of 76,500 liters (17,000 Imperial gallons). It is equipped with steam pipes, water pipes, air pipes, etc. During fermentation, the carbon dioxide gas generated is passed from the main pipe at the top of the tank into the carbon dioxide gas manufacturing room for the production of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>6. Distillation Room The factory is equipped with a continuous distillation refining and purification machine manufactured by Blair Company. The alcohol initially distilled out contains low-boiling point aldehydes. The alcohol finally distilled out contains high-boiling point fusel oil, which is completely separated from the finished product. Therefore, the quality of the finished product is extremely pure.</p>
<p>7. Laboratory The factory has two chemical test rooms, specializing in the chemical management of the manufacturing part. There is also a culture sterilization room, specializing in yeast culture and other research work. In addition, a small-scale experimental factory is also set up. Each raw material must be tested on a small scale before large-scale production. The factory attaches great importance to research work. All instruments are available.</p>
<p>8. Canning Room The factory has two fire-risk canning rooms. The filling method generally uses automatic management. The capacity and weight are accurately weighed before being transported to the warehouse for sale.</p>
<p>The factory uses high-quality tinplate to manufacture 18-liter (4-Imperial gallon) tin cans. High-quality white iron is used to manufacture 36.4-liter (8-Imperial gallon) and 200.2-liter (44-Imperial gallon) white iron cans. This type of white iron can does not generate corrosion, so there is no danger of alcohol being mixed with iron rust.</p>
<p>(3) Steam Supply The factory is equipped with two water-tube boilers manufactured by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. Each has a heating surface of 3,900 square feet. All transportation uses machinery.</p>
<p>(4) Electricity Supply The factory is equipped with an A.E.G. 400-kilowatt generator (1,500 revolutions per minute), which is directly connected to a 6,000-revolution turbine, which can supply electricity to all factory motors and lights. The exhaust steam from the turbine passes to the distillation room and other parts for application. Therefore, steam consumption is extremely economical.</p>
<p>(5) Raw Material Storage The factory also uses grains, potatoes, and molasses as raw materials. In addition to grain and potato warehouses, which are being designed and built; two molasses storage tanks have been built. Each can hold 6,000 tons of molasses, and the two tanks can hold a total of 12,000 tons, which is enough for four months of production.</p>
<p>(6) Finished Product Storage The factory has two alcohol storage tanks, each with a capacity of one million liters, and the two tanks can hold a total of two million liters. If the daily output is 30,000 liters, it can store two months of products.</p>
<p>(7) Water Supply The factory has a well with a depth of 700 feet, which can produce 136,500 liters (30,000 gallons) of water per hour. After being pressed out by an air compressor, it is pumped into the water tower by a centrifugal pump for the use of the entire factory.</p>
<p>(8) Fire Prevention The factory is equipped with a fire-fighting water pump, which is driven by a 125-horsepower gasoline engine (Sterling-petrel). The pump pumps 4,556 liters (1,000 Imperial gallons) of water per minute and can send the water from the Huangpu River to all parts of the factory and residences to prevent fire.</p>
<p>Expansion Plan</p>
<p>The factory has built a factory building for the manufacture of carbon dioxide gas, in preparation for installing machinery and manufacturing liquid carbon dioxide gas and dry ice in the future. Liquid carbon dioxide gas is an important raw material for manufacturing soda; dry ice is the latest invention of refrigerant, which has greater cooling power than artificial ice, and its application is extremely convenient. The factory will have a daily output of about 20 tons, which can meet the national alcohol consumption. Other factories, such as pure alcohol, rectified spirit, and automobile stove, are also being actively prepared.</p>
<h3>Continuing the Work of Suiren: Commemorating the Opening of the Chinese Alcohol Manufacturing Co., Ltd.</h3>
<p>— Inscription by Sun Ke</p>
<h3>Sincere Hope</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhenggang</p>
<p>The Chinese Alcohol Factory, since the winter of 1933, after the Ministry of Industry and overseas Chinese businessman Huang Jiangquan signed a contract for joint government-merchant operation. After more than a year of active preparation, it has now been completely successful. I think the establishment of this factory has two important meanings:</p>
<p>First, establishing the foundation of national defense industry;</p>
<p>Second, advocating the first voice of overseas Chinese investment;</p>
<p>Now I will first talk about the meaning of the first point: Alcohol is the most important raw material for modern industry and national defense, which is generally known. Whether it is medicine, chemistry, or smokeless gunpowder, all require a large amount of alcohol. Recently, many countries have invented the mixed use of alcohol and gasoline, or the replacement of gasoline with alcohol, which makes alcohol an extremely important liquid fuel. My country's industry has gradually developed, and my country's national defense is now actively being built. The need for alcohol is becoming more and more urgent, and the amount of alcohol needed is increasing day by day. In the past, the alcohol needed by our country was supplied by imports, which is not only a loss of rights and interests, but also a crisis of national defense. Fortunately, the Chinese Alcohol Factory has been completely successful, with an average daily output of more than 3,000 liters, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Lu, and Ji. With this emerging industry, we can stop part of the leakage of our country in the future, and at the same time, we can establish a permanent foundation for our country's industry and national defense.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the meaning of the second point. Using the capital of overseas Chinese to develop our country's industry has become a common proposition for people who advocate production undertakings. At the same time, our overseas Chinese compatriots have recently felt the economic downturn in various countries and have also demanded to return to invest. However, because the country has been in trouble for many years, the capital of overseas Chinese has not been effectively protected, so the above proposition and demand have not been specifically realized. Therefore, now the problem with overseas Chinese capital is not how to absorb it, but how to protect it. If the problem of protection is adequately resolved, then the absorption of overseas Chinese capital is not a problem. This time, the Ministry of Industry has granted the Chinese Alcohol Factory the exclusive rights in the five provinces of Jiang, Zhe, Min, Lu, and Ji, which is to eliminate unreasonable domestic competition and give overseas Chinese special protection. I believe that the establishment of this factory will surely be the leader of overseas Chinese investment.</p>
<p>In the past, the failure of Chinese industry, whether it was state-owned, private, or joint government-merchant, the reason for its failure was not failure in technology, but failure in management. In the future, the colleagues of the Chinese Alcohol Factory must pay special attention and efforts to technology and management. This is a sincere hope for the Chinese Alcohol Factory.</p>

<h3>The Path to the Development of China's Alcohol Industry</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhou Sheng</p>
<p>The development of an industry can be divided into three periods: first, the experimental period; second, the establishment and expansion period; and third, the fulfillment period. The establishment of factories and a considerable period of experimentation are necessary to thoroughly determine the collection of raw materials, manufacturing methods, and the selection of sites. After successful experiments, factories are then established for production. Those responsible for manufacturing must constantly seek improvement in methods and product applications to discuss expansion. Progressing in this order will inevitably lead to great success.</p>
<p>The Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry has been experimenting with the alcohol industry for many years and has achieved considerable results. Since the institute's advocacy, alcohol factories have sprung up everywhere, indicating a transition from the experimental period to the factory establishment period. How to expand existing factories in the future depends on the efforts of those in charge. Taking advantage of the opening of the China Alcohol Factory, I am presenting various important issues related to the alcohol industry for discussion with people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>(I) The Raw Material Problem</p>
<p>Raw materials for making alcohol mainly contain starch, sugar, and other carbohydrates. They are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Starchy Raw Materials</p>
<p>Starchy raw materials primarily include sweet potatoes and sorghum. The sweet potatoes in Wenrui, Qingdao, and the Ping-Sui Railway area are abundant. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation, they are left to rot or used as feed during bumper harvests. If large-scale drying factories could be established locally, using artificial drying methods to bake sweet potatoes into dried slices as raw materials for alcohol production, it would greatly benefit rural areas. Moreover, land prices in the production areas are very low. If widespread purchases and planting could be undertaken, it would also be a way to open up sources of profit. However, because bandits are rampant throughout the country, merchants dare not go deep into these areas. The implementation of this proposal is not yet the right time. Therefore, for the time being, we can only entrust merchants to purchase them at any time. However, local farmers, seeing the many buyers, raise prices, which increases the cost of alcohol production, making it difficult to compete with foreign goods. The current plan is to advise officials and people in the production areas to open up wasteland and plant extensively so that both food for the people and manufacturing will not be affected, and barren land can be gradually developed. This would be the best plan.</p>
<p>As for the production of sorghum, the three northeastern provinces are the most abundant. Since the Northeast issue arose, the import of sorghum into the mainland has been greatly restricted. Sorghum has a lower starch content than dried sweet potatoes, and its price is higher, so its use is not yet widespread.</p>
<p>Here are the moisture and carbohydrate contents of dried sweet potatoes and sorghum:</p>
<p>Water</p>
<p>Sorghum 2.92 - 13.69%</p>
<p>Dried Sweet Potatoes 8.30 - 15.39%</p>
<p>Carbohydrates</p>
<p>Sorghum 62.68 - 66.01%</p>
<p>Dried Sweet Potatoes 66.60 - 71.59%</p>
<p>The dried sweet potatoes produced in various provinces still use old varieties, and it is necessary to improve the yield and starch content per mu. If new varieties can be promoted and widely publicized, farmers' profits will surely double. Thus, the alcohol industry is closely related to the improvement of agriculture. Other raw materials, such as barley for making malt and wheat bran for making koji, are secondary starchy raw materials for making alcohol.</p>
<p>(B) Sugar-Containing Raw Materials</p>
<p>Sugar-containing raw materials mainly include sugar cane, beet, and molasses. Molasses, a byproduct of sugar factories, is highly developed for alcohol production. The United States uses sugarcane molasses from Louisiana, Cuba, and other places; England uses sugarcane molasses from Java and other places; Germany uses beet molasses from its own country; Japan uses sugarcane molasses from Taiwan; and other countries all use molasses as their main raw material. The alcohol produced from molasses is no different from that produced from starchy raw materials. Moreover, its source is more abundant, and unlike starchy raw materials, it is not related to people's food supply, sometimes causing supply problems. The concentration of sugarcane molasses and beet molasses is about 88 degrees Brix (88°Brix), and their common sugar content is as follows:</p>
<p>Sugarcane Sugar Inverted Sugar</p>
<p>Sugarcane Molasses 33% 22%</p>
<p>Beet Molasses 46%</p>
<p>(C) Cellulose-Containing Raw Materials</p>
<p>These raw materials are wood, peat, waste from fiber manufacturing plants, and sulfite waste liquor from paper mills. About a century ago, Mr. Braconnot discovered that concentrated sulfuric acid can dissolve cellulose and dilute sulfuric acid can convert cellulose into fermentable sugar. Scholars from various countries competed to study using cellulose-containing materials such as sawdust and peat as raw materials for alcohol production. The result of the Georgetown Alcohol Factory in the United States was that 100 kilograms of dry wood yielded an average of only 5.34 liters of alcohol. It eventually shut down due to low production. Whether microorganisms can be used to convert cellulose into alcohol in the future depends on our diligent research.</p>
<p>In summary, the main raw materials for alcohol production in our country should be dried sweet potatoes, sorghum, and molasses. Before the supply of dried sweet potatoes and sorghum can be fully guaranteed, we must follow the established practices of countries such as England and the United States and use molasses as a supplementary raw material. All the equipment in our factory is based on this plan, and various raw materials can be used to make alcohol, so the supply of raw materials will not be a problem.</p>
<p>(II) The Manufacturing Problem</p>
<p>The scope of alcohol manufacturing is very broad. It is difficult for those not proficient in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and applied microbiology to fully understand it. The analysis of raw materials and the inspection during manufacturing belong to analytical chemistry. The gelatinization and saccharification of starch and the manufacturing of malt belong to enzyme chemistry. The manufacturing of rice koji and wheat bran, the pure culture of yeast, belong to applied microbiology, and the search for yeast and molds belongs to pure microbiology. The distillation of alcohol belongs to chemical engineering. Since the various manufacturing procedures are so complicated and difficult, the production volume will be greatly affected if manufacturing is not careful. Here, I will highlight the important aspects and briefly describe them:</p>
<p>(A) Yeast Selection</p>
<p>The properties of yeast vary depending on the type. Some are suitable for the fermentation of starchy raw materials, and some are suitable for the fermentation of sugary raw materials. The important characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It can completely convert fermentable substances into alcohol within 36 hours.</p>
<p>(2) It can resist high temperatures of at least 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>(3) It can resist high concentrations of alcohol—at least 12%.</p>
<p>(4) It can resist high acidity.</p>
<p>(5) It is absolutely pure and does not contain harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>Our country has a very long history of winemaking, and there should be excellent yeasts in the wine medicines and wine cakes in various places. The Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry has already conducted research on this work, and has obtained many results. Among them, there are several types that can be used for large-scale production.</p>
<p>(B) Yeast Culture</p>
<p>In large-scale manufacturing, how to prevent yeast from being contaminated by external sources is the biggest problem. In the past, starchy alcohol production mostly used the lactic fermentation method, which caused the yeast mash to contain a sufficient amount of lactic acid to prevent bacterial intrusion, and the yeast could multiply sufficiently. Nowadays, various countries use hydrochloric acid instead of lactic acid, which is also very effective, but the yeast must be properly domesticated. As for molasses alcohol production, using a pure culture is the most appropriate, such as the Magne Machine in the United States, which can culture pure yeast for a long time and is widely used in various countries.</p>
<p>(C) Starch Gelatinization and Saccharification</p>
<p>For starch gelatinization, the Henze high-pressure cooker is the most common; this machine is especially effective when equipped with a stirrer. Starch saccharification methods can be divided into four types:</p>
<p>1. Acid Saccharification Method. This method requires a large amount of acid, and the material used to manufacture the steaming engine must also be acid-resistant, so few people use it.</p>
<p>2. Using Malt as a Saccharification Agent. This method is the most popular in European and American countries. There are floor-type, box-type, and drum-type methods. The floor-type method takes up more space, while the box-type and drum-type methods require more expensive equipment. Malt has a high saccharification power, and using it as a saccharification agent produces higher alcohol yields, so it is widely used.</p>
<p>3. Koji as a Saccharification Agent. This method is most popular in Japan. Its main mold is Aspergillus oryzae. The manufacturing is very simple, and the price of raw materials is low, so many alcohol factories in our country also imitate it.</p>
<p>4. Using a Microbial Method. This method is the so-called Amyle Process, which can use a very small amount of mold cells to convert a large amount of starch into sugar without using malt or wheat koji as a saccharification agent. However, this method can only be used for corn and sorghum. If it is used for the saccharification of sweet potato mash, there will be various difficulties.</p>
<p>Among the above methods, malt is the most suitable for large-scale manufacturing. This is why our factory has specifically set up the latest malt manufacturing room.</p>
<p>(D) Yeast Fermentation</p>
<p>After starch is saccharified, it turns into dextrin and sugar. Sugar can be directly fermented, while dextrin must be converted into sugar by the action of enzymes before it can be fermented. If this residual dextrin cannot be completely fermented, the loss will be great. Therefore, the amount of alcohol produced depends on whether saccharification can be complete and fermentation is strong. Otherwise, the production volume will inevitably decrease. Furthermore, it is particularly important to pay attention to how to prevent the acidity from increasing during fermentation.</p>
<p>(E) Distillation</p>
<p>The quality of alcohol is closely related to the design of the distillation machine and the operation of the distillation process. It is most important to be able to completely separate low-boiling point aldehydes and high-boiling point fusel oil. Our factory is equipped with three distillation towers. The fermented mash first passes through the distillation tower to extract the alcohol components, and then through the purification tower to extract low-boiling point impurities (such as aldehydes). This set of alcohol liquid is then entered into the rectification tower to increase the alcohol content. At the same time, high-boiling point impurities (such as fusel oil) are also removed. Its solid structure and excellent design are rare in East Asian countries, so the quality of the alcohol can surpass the best imported goods.</p>
<p>(III) Factory Management Issues</p>
<p>Since the alcohol manufacturing process is quite complicated, chemical management should be implemented for the composition of raw materials and the changes during manufacturing to facilitate improvement. The important aspects are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Composition of Raw Materials: For starchy raw materials, carbohydrates such as starch, dextrin, and fiber should be analyzed. For sugary raw materials, sucrose, invert sugar, and nitrogen, etc., should be analyzed.</p>
<p>2. Composition of Saccharified Ingredients, such as starch, dextrin, and glucose, etc.</p>
<p>3. Composition of Molasses Mash, such as sucrose, invert sugar, and nitrogen, etc.</p>
<p>4. The sugar content, acidity, pH value, temperature, alcohol content, and microscopic examination of yeast mash and fermentation mash should be performed every one to two hours to observe the phenomenon of fermentation progress.</p>
<p>5. Analysis of Finished Products, such as alcohol content, acidity, aldehydes, fusel oil, wood alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>Alcohol manufacturing aims to obtain the highest fermentation efficiency. Therefore, the expected amount of alcohol and the actual amount of alcohol obtained must be carefully compared. If the fermentation efficiency is too low, there must be shortcomings in the manufacturing method. This may be due to the yeast's weak ability, or the acidity, concentration, and temperature are not properly adjusted. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully examine the analysis results of each part and make improvements. The importance of this chemical management must be paid close attention to even in very small-scale factories, otherwise managers will be at a loss even with rich experience.</p>
<p>(IV) Alcohol Usage Issues</p>
<p>Alcohol is mainly used in three major categories: fuel, industrial raw materials, and general-purpose products. For fuel, it is mainly used for lighting, heating, and power, with the consumption of power being the highest. Industrial raw materials can be divided into three types: (1) Alcohol remains a part of the finished product, such as in paints and cosmetics. (2) Alcohol is used during manufacturing, but the alcohol is removed after the product is released, so the finished product does not retain the alcohol component, such as celluloid, transparent soap, photographic film, rayon, and textile printing and dyeing. (3) Alcohol is combined with other drugs, resulting in a chemical reaction, and the result is that the nature of the alcohol is completely changed, such as in the manufacture of ether and anesthetics. General-purpose products are mainly used to prepare disinfectants and preservatives.</p>
<p>In recent years, industry in our country has gradually developed, so the use of alcohol has also become more widespread. Such as MSG, soap, fragrances, cosmetics, celluloid, paint, and mixed beverages, all require a large amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>Recently, alcohol factories have spread to Shanxi, Shandong, Zhili, Jiangsu, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces. In the future, there may be a surplus in production. Therefore, the issue of alcohol usage should be studied urgently to prevent problems before they arise.</p>
<p>The use of alcohol as a power fuel is the most common. Countries that lack petroleum have mandated that people mix gasoline with alcohol. Our country imports 117,000,000 liters of gasoline every year. If 10% alcohol could be mixed in, the consumption of alcohol would reach as much as 11,700,000 liters. However, ordinary alcohol cannot be completely mixed with gasoline when it is cold, so it is advisable to use anhydrous alcohol. The most notable methods for producing anhydrous alcohol are the Hiag method, the heat method, and the gypsum method. After ordinary alcohol is refined once, the cost will inevitably be higher, and its price will not be able to compete with gasoline. European and American countries have all felt this difficulty. In recent years, governments have successively enforced this policy, hoping to reduce the import of gasoline, and their painstaking efforts can be imagined. If our government can also make this determination, implement mixing alcohol with gasoline, and stipulate the fairest price so that alcohol factories can obtain a small profit, and the import of gasoline can also be slightly reduced. After this method is slightly effective, further methods can be used to completely manufacture power fuel with alcohol, so that the power fuel problem can be resolved one day.</p>

<h3>Suggestion on Using Alcohol as Internal Combustion Engine Fuel</h3>
<p>— Gu Yuquan</p>
<p>Nowadays, the application of internal combustion engines is widespread, and the demand for liquid fuels is increasing daily. In countries with oil mines, gasoline is naturally the primary fuel for internal combustion engines. In countries lacking oil mines, most rely on imported gasoline. If self-sufficiency is desired, then appropriate substitutes are required. The main substitutes are no more than two types: one is Benzollne, a byproduct of asphalt, and the other is alcohol. Substituting gasoline with alcohol has been experimented with more successfully in various European countries, providing us with many references for studying this issue. The main motivation for the Ministry of Industry to collaborate with Mr. Huang Zongxiao and Mr. Huang Jiangquan in establishing the China Alcohol Factory probably lies in this.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the situation of various countries using alcohol to replace gasoline.</p>
<p>(A) Germany - Germany's alcohol is exclusively sold by the government. The raw materials used by farmers to produce alcohol are mostly sweet potatoes, followed by grains. The raw materials for industrial alcohol production utilize waste liquid (Sulfite Vatte Liguor) from paper mills. Alcohol made from sweet potatoes accounts for 70% of the total production. Since 1920, Germany has implemented the mixed use of alcohol and gasoline, managed by the government. Starting in October 1932, the government stipulated that gasoline merchants must mix national alcohol up to 10% of the gasoline consumption, with the value of anhydrous alcohol set at 1.92 marks per gallon (approximately 2.1 yuan in national currency). Gasoline sold in mixed form must contain at least 20% to 30% alcohol in winter. The price of unmixed gasoline has also increased due to the increased burden on oil merchants after purchasing alcohol. If oil merchants want to transfer the alcohol back to the government, it can be calculated at 85% of the price. This policy aims to encourage and promote the alcohol industry. Germany's recent trend is to maximize the use of domestically produced liquid fuels, blending various liquid fuels to become fuel for internal combustion engines. Imported gasoline accounts for only 35% of this blended fuel. Germany's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in liquid fuels are evident. (Appendix Table 1)</p>
<p>Table 1: Composition of Germany's Recent Liquid Fuels</p>
<p>Anhydrous Alcohol: 10%</p>
<p>Methanol (Synthesis of Water Gas): 10%</p>
<p>Benzol (from coke ovens): 10%</p>
<p>Synthetic Gasoline (hydrogenation of oil coal): 35%</p>
<p>Imported Gasoline: 35%</p>
<p>(B) France - France's alcohol is also exclusively sold by the government. All industrial alcohol is made from sugar beets or sugar syrup. Since 1923, the French government has announced regulations requiring all importing oil merchants to purchase alcohol equivalent to 10% of the imported gasoline volume. The price of alcohol used for fuel was set at 9.23 francs per gallon (approximately 1.7 yuan in national currency). After June 1931, the government increased the stipulated alcohol content in the mixture from 10% to 25% or 35%, with 25% as the minimum. At the same time, the selling price of anhydrous alcohol was revised to 4.43 francs per gallon (only 0.81 yuan in national currency, more than half the previous price). The selling price of pure gasoline is 0.12 yuan per gallon higher than that of mixed gasoline to promote the use of alcohol. In this way, the amount of alcohol used to replace gasoline can reach as much as 39 million gallons per year. Recognizing the various difficulties encountered when driving with high alcohol content, the French government stipulates that fire trucks and ambulances, etc., may not add gasoline according to the prescribed proportions, but their efforts to promote the application of alcohol are clear.</p>
<p>(C) Italy - Italy produces surplus wine, so it utilizes a portion to produce alcohol. The government stipulates that 25% of the imported and produced alcohol quantity should be added to gasoline. Gasoline merchants must purchase the stipulated quantity of alcohol. The composition of the mixed fuel is 20% alcohol and 80% gasoline. In 1932, the alcohol added to gasoline reached 2.6 million gallons, with the selling price reduced to 5.57 lira per gallon, far below cost. The government is still studying manufacturing raw materials to increase the country's alcohol production.</p>
<p>(D) Sweden - Sweden is a world-renowned paper-producing country, so the raw material for alcohol in that country uses paper pulp waste liquid, which is extremely low in cost. During the European War, the supply of gasoline raw materials was cut off, and Sweden relied entirely on alcohol and methanol as fuel for fuel engines to replace gasoline. Currently, the gasoline used in Sweden must be mixed with 20% to 25% alcohol, with an annual alcohol consumption of 700,000 gallons.</p>
<p>(E) Austria and Hungary - Austria's alcohol is made from molasses and sweet potatoes, all controlled by the government's Alcohol Administration. The alcohol content in the mixed gasoline is 25%, with an annual consumption of approximately 300,000 gallons. Hungary is an alcohol exporting country. Recognizing the slow sales of alcohol, it has compelled the addition of 20% alcohol to gasoline since 1929, except for gasoline with a lighter quality (specific gravity below 0.735). Since the promulgation of this regulation, it has greatly benefited the national economy.</p>
<p>(F) Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia - The Czech Republic's trivial alcohol is produced in rural areas, mostly from sweet potato-like raw materials. Since 1932, the government has compelled the mixing of 20% to 25% alcohol in gasoline. After the implementation of this order, the annual sales of alcohol reached as much as 15.6 million gallons. Yugoslavia also adopted the mandatory mixed application of alcohol and gasoline as fuel in 1932. All gasoline sold must contain 20% alcohol, except for gasoline used in airplanes. The amount of alcohol used to replace gasoline annually reaches 1.8 million gallons.</p>
<p>Other European countries, such as Spain and Poland, as well as Argentina and Cuba in South America, have the same or similar methods, all aiming to utilize alcohol or replace gasoline.</p>
<p>Regarding the impact of mixed use of alcohol and gasoline on automobiles, several important issues can be raised here for reference.</p>
<p>If the same amount of power is desired, the consumption of alcohol is 50% higher than that of gasoline when using alcohol completely, meaning that the power of 1.5 gallons of alcohol is only equivalent to the power of 1 gallon of gasoline. If 10% alcohol is mixed into gasoline, its consumption is 4% to 5% higher than that of gasoline. If 5% alcohol is mixed into gasoline, its consumption is 1% to 2% higher than that of gasoline. If the same acceleration and action as using pure gasoline are desired when driving, the carburetor in the automobile machine should be slightly modified to increase the concentration of the mixed gas, and the fuel consumption will also increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Alcohol has an extremely high "Octane Number," which reduces "Knocking" in gasoline, making driving smoother. Gasoline containing 10% alcohol can increase this number by seven digits.</p>
<p>According to road driving tests, if gasoline containing 10% alcohol is used, there is no significant impact on starting and acceleration during driving. However, if more than 20% alcohol is added, there are various difficulties during driving, such as difficulty starting, difficulty accelerating after starting, and Vapor Lock, etc.</p>
<p>In short, if the concentration of alcohol added to gasoline is around 10%, there are no significant difficulties when driving. Ordinary automobiles that use pure gasoline can easily use this mixed gasoline, and the fuel consumption is only 5% higher.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the mixture of alcohol and gasoline is a suitable fuel for internal combustion engines. However, this mixed fuel is prone to separation when water seeps in. After separation, alcohol and water form another mixture, which will cause various difficulties during application. Because at any temperature and in any proportion, pure anhydrous alcohol (Anbydrous Ethyl Alcohol) can be completely mixed with gasoline. If the alcohol contains a small amount of water, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Table 1: Separation Temperature of Gasoline and Alcohol</p>
<p>(Gasoline containing one-tenth alcohol)</p>
<p>It can be seen from Table 1 that gasoline containing one-tenth alcohol may have alcohol and gasoline separation in winter if mixed with 2 to 3 parts per thousand of water. Therefore, the alcohol added to gasoline must not contain moisture. Ordinary pure alcohol often contains a small amount of water, so it must be removed before mixing.</p>
<p>To ensure that the mixture of gasoline and alcohol is absolutely free of moisture, anhydrous alcohol can be used during mixing. However, during storage after mixing, a certain amount of moisture often seeps into the storage container from the outside, or water vapor from the air mixes in. At a fixed temperature, the more alcohol the gasoline contains, the more moisture it can contain without causing it to separate from the alcohol.</p>
<p>There is still an attached table connecting to the fourth edition</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>This table is a continuation from the third edition.</p>
<p>Table 2: Degree of Separation of Water Content in Gasoline and Alcohol</p>
<p>(At 20 degrees Fahrenheit)</p>
<p>Since the mixture of gasoline and alcohol cannot absolutely prevent the infiltration of external moisture during storage, the temporary solution is to add a blending agent to lower the separation temperature of gasoline and alcohol to an extremely low level, such as zero degrees Fahrenheit, even if moisture seeps in, so there is no risk of separation even in winter. This blending agent can be divided into two categories: (1) Aromatic hydrocarbons, such as (Benzene, Toluene), etc., (2) Higher alcohols, such as (Butyl Alcohol). The application and quantity of the blending agent still need to be studied.</p>
<p>The Central Industrial Testing Institute of the Ministry of Industry started testing the mixed use of alcohol and gasoline a year ago (the test report is published in the Industrial Center published by the Institute). It is now planning to conduct a long-distance driving test to study the difficulties in driving. The way to achieve self-sufficiency in body fuel. In this way, the establishment of the China Alcohol Factory not only opens a new path in industry but also bears a major mission in national defense. Today, we wish the China Alcohol Factory success and suggest this opinion to society.</p>
<h3>The Importance of the Alcohol Industry and the Mission of the China Alcohol Factory</h3>
<p>— Liu Yin Fu</p>
<p>Alcohol is an important raw material in both industry and national defense. All research in chemical manufacturing, medicine, cosmetics, paint, rayon, smokeless gunpowder, and blended beverages requires a large amount of alcohol. As China's industry gradually develops, the need for alcohol is increasing daily. Before 1921, alcohol imports were less than 4.5 million liters. After 1921, they increased from 4.5 million liters to 9 million liters, and even 17 to 18 million liters. In 1929, it increased to more than 23 million liters. In recent years, it has remained between 9 million and 14 million liters. It is hardly a way to achieve self-sufficiency and independence to rely entirely on others for industrial and national defense needs.</p>
<p>In recent years, countries around the world have been trending towards self-sufficiency policies. In countries lacking oil mines, they are all working hard on the research of gasoline substitutes, and alcohol has become a recognized suitable substitute. Therefore, alcohol has increased its importance in liquid fuels again. Examining the recent situation in European countries, they have all successively enacted laws to compel the mixed use of alcohol and gasoline, stipulating the quantity of alcohol that oil merchants should purchase and the composition of the mixed alcohol. Even the United States, known for its abundance of petroleum, has also proposed the use of agricultural alcohol as liquid fuel. China lacks oil mines and has not yet started mining, while internal combustion engines, cars, and airplanes all need a large amount of fuel. Currently, they mostly rely on imports. Therefore, in the past three years, the annual import quantity of gasoline has reached more than 70 million to more than 110 million liters. The enormous leakage of financial resources is truly alarming. If China wants to achieve self-sufficiency in liquid fuels, it cannot help but follow the example of European and American countries and promote the mixed application of alcohol and gasoline. However, if this policy is implemented, the demand for alcohol will increase sharply with the proportion of alcohol added to gasoline. If we assume that China's annual consumption of gasoline is more than 110 million liters, and the proportion of alcohol added to gasoline is 10% to 30%, then the annual consumption of alcohol will increase by 11 million liters to 33 million liters compared to previous years. In other words, if we calculate China's current alcohol consumption at 13.5 million liters, then after the mixed application of alcohol and gasoline is implemented, the consumption will inevitably increase by one to three times. Therefore, China's alcohol industry will not be able to meet the demand in the future without sufficient development and mass production.</p>
<p>Checking the raw materials for manufacturing alcohol, the yield in China is extremely abundant. Agricultural products such as sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes are available everywhere. Sweet potatoes are found in all provinces, and sorghum is produced in the north. According to the report of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the annual output of sweet potatoes and sorghum in China is more than 200 million dan each. In terms of per mu, the yield of sweet potatoes is even more abundant, with sorghum yielding 1.5 dan per mu and sweet potatoes yielding 10 dan per mu. Moreover, the selling price is low, making them suitable for manufacturing alcohol. Therefore, if China establishes factories to manufacture alcohol as much as possible, there will be no shortage of raw materials, and agricultural products can find an outlet. If China's sugar industry can develop further in the future, then using sugar factory by-products to manufacture alcohol will be even more expected for the development of the alcohol industry.</p>
<p>The alcohol industry in various provinces of China is very small in scale, with very small yields. Combining the new and old-fashioned factories in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiankebei, Hunan, Hubei, and Guizhou, their output is only 800,000 liters, and the manufacturing methods are mostly outdated, with low alcohol content, making it difficult to supply for industrial and fuel use.</p>
<p>Recognizing the urgent need for domestic alcohol, the Ministry of Industry had long planned to establish a factory. It had conducted detailed research on the raw materials and technologies for manufacturing alcohol and had established a small-scale alcohol factory in the Central Industrial Testing Institute to test the production of alcohol from starch raw materials such as sorghum and sweet potatoes as the basis for establishing a factory. However, due to financial constraints, it could not be realized immediately. Last year, overseas Chinese Mr. Huang Zongxiao and Mr. Huang Jiangquan, with the enthusiasm to revitalize the industry, aspired to invest and establish an alcohol factory in China. They cooperated with the Ministry of Industry, and after more than a year of preparation, they were fortunate to see it completed. The estimated output is 30,000 liters per day on average. In the future, they plan to expand as much as possible to increase output. The establishment of this factory can somewhat block part of China's financial leakage. However, as various domestic industries are booming, the demand for alcohol is increasing daily. To achieve self-sufficiency in domestic alcohol, it cannot be achieved by one or two large-scale factories alone. It is hoped that domestic enthusiastic industrialists will jointly promote the utilization of China's extremely abundant raw materials and continue to establish factories so that China's alcohol industry can be fully developed, which will be beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Inauguration Commemoration of China Alcohol Manufacturing Company: Liquid Fuel, Alcohol is One, Establishing a Factory, Blocking Financial Leakage, Fortunately Successful, Deep Roots, Far-Reaching Plans, Unstinting Admiration</h3>
<p>— Ju Zheng</p>
<h3>My Recollections</h3>
<p>— Shi Ruishan</p>
<p>I remember eight months ago, the factory site of our China Alcohol Factory—No. 1 Bailianjing, Pudong—was still a barren land. Within the 150 mu area, the only embellishments were a few small willow trees and a dilapidated building. When we first came to Pudong to inspect and measure, we felt very lonely; the open space was quiet, only the chirping of the little birds and the wild croaking of the field frogs disturbed the silence of this barren land!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, many of the photos in this special issue, and those splendid storage seeds, crystal-style factory buildings, towering water towers, and artesian wells 700 feet deep, were all our dreams eight months ago. Fortunately, our dreams can now be realized before our eyes.</p>
<p>As for the location of the factory, we spent a lot of time considering this point. To facilitate future expansion, the factory was decided to be next to the Laogongmao Wharf, with the water tower and engine room surrounding the factory.</p>
<p>Regarding the progress of the project, we strived for speed. Within three weeks, we completed an artesian well 700 feet deep that could produce 400 gallons of water per minute. To facilitate engineers supervising the work day and night, we spent a very short time completing a small bungalow. On May 10th last year, the factory building started construction, using a total of more than 800 large wooden piles. In that hot summer, especially under the unprecedentedly hot summer in Shanghai in the past 60 years, we disregarded everything and continued to work day and night. We originally wanted to customize the steel structure in the United States, but we learned that the American workers were striking, so we redesigned it and collected steel structure materials in Shanghai, which slightly restricted the construction time. Before the roof was covered, we had already started building boilers and distillation machines, working non-stop day and night, and finally completed various important projects in November 1934, and at the same time started manufacturing alcohol.</p>
<p>We know that the China Alcohol Factory is the first kind of business invested and established by overseas Chinese, which is also an expression of our overseas Chinese's love for the motherland! There are many businesses waiting to be developed in industrially backward China. We are holding the spirit of patriotism, returning to China to invest, hoping that China can occupy a position among the leaders in the industrial field.</p>

<h3>Research on Alcohol as a Substitute for Motor Fuel</h3>
<p>— Lin Zeren</p>
<p>The world's supply of motor fuel depends on gasoline. In recent years, with the development of industry, there are countless power machines that need gasoline. For example, the annual production of automobiles, steamships, trucks, airplanes, and other fixed engines is increasing daily, which is quite alarming. Therefore, the problem of automobile fuel is also valued by the modern industrial world, and the research on alcohol as a substitute for gasoline is especially worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Crude oil has existed underground for a long time, and the number of oil mine developers is also quite large. Now it is not easy to find a corresponding oil mine again. Although it cannot be determined that the world's oil mines will be sufficient for mining for a certain period of time, experts say that the day when gasoline is exhausted is not far away. According to the statistics of the US Gasoline Technology Bureau, 40% of the gasoline naturally stored in the United States has been used. If this continues, there will eventually be a day of gasoline panic, and its impact on the future of the industrial world is indeed not insignificant.</p>
<p>European, American, and Japanese countries have seen this and have tried various remedial methods, and the result is that replacing gasoline with alcohol is a simple and easy task. Currently, various countries in the world have implemented it one after another. The composition of the preparation includes the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Alcohol, distillates of kerosene, and other blending agents,</p>
<p>(2) Alcohol, ether, and distillates of kerosene,</p>
<p>(3) Alcohol, ether, and derivatives of coal gas,</p>
<p>(4) Alcohol, vinegar, and denaturing or neutralizing agents,</p>
<p>The first two items cannot completely replace gasoline, but they are sufficient to reduce gasoline consumption. Now European countries have already implemented it compulsorily. As for the third item in the preparation composition, there are coal gas derivatives, such as raw materials such as Benzene and Toluol. If the price is lower, it is still acceptable. Only the fourth item, all raw materials containing sugar and starch, can be manufactured and taken inexhaustibly, which is most worthy of our attention. The various preparation methods are exemplified as follows:</p>
<p>There are several types of patented inventions that mix alcohol and ester to replace gasoline:</p>
<p>Since 1918, South Africa has been using alcohol to replace gasoline. The composition is:</p>
<p>Denatured alcohol 55 parts</p>
<p>Ether 45 parts</p>
<p>Ammonia, etc. about 0.25 parts</p>
<p>According to the experimenters, the number of miles per gallon of alcohol is almost the same as the efficiency of high-quality gasoline. Its power and speed can be compared with gasoline, and the engine using alcohol does not rust or vibrate, and the carbon deposits on the engine are not as many as those using gasoline.</p>
<p>In 1920, Xiangshan alcohol power fuel inventor Mr. Fushide invented the following composition:</p>
<p>Alcohol 63.3 parts</p>
<p>Mystery 34.8 parts</p>
<p>Kerosene 1.3 parts</p>
<p>Pyridine 0.6 parts</p>
<p>According to Fu's experiment, the efficiency obtained from the above formula is the same as gasoline, and it is not difficult to start when the motor is cold. The engine does not leave carbon deposits and does not rust, especially the rest.</p>
<p>British Guiana produces Alcolene fuel, which uses alcohol as the main raw material. Its composition is as follows:</p>
<p>Alcohol 65 parts</p>
<p>Mystery 34 parts</p>
<p>Kerosene 0.5 parts</p>
<p>Aniline 0.7 parts</p>
<p>Methyl violet is added to the color</p>
<p>According to the above preparation method, the results of the experiment are also very impressive, and the number of miles driven is 90% of the efficiency compared with gasoline. As for the preparation composition, the price of mystery is slightly more expensive, so when experimenting, we plan to reduce the amount as much as possible to meet the principle of economy. If it is doped excessively, in addition to being affected by its value, the atomizer of the engine is also controlled by its rate. The temperature of the atomizer is extremely cold when there is too much mysterious component, and the temperature drops below the dew point, which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>According to the actual experiment, alcohol fuel has the following advantages compared with gasoline:</p>
<p>(1) It is more convenient to start a cold engine than using gasoline.</p>
<p>(2) The engine and fuel parts do not accumulate carbon ash.</p>
<p>(3) The acceleration force is the same as gasoline, or even exceeds it.</p>
<p>(4) There is absolutely no vibration when driving fast.</p>
<p>(5) The burning temperature is lower than when using gasoline.</p>
<p>(6) The engine is not easy to induce rust.</p>
<p>(7) The power and mileage per gallon are comparable to gasoline.</p>
<p>(8) The cost per mile is cheaper than gasoline.</p>
<p>(9) The consumption of lubricating oil is quite small.</p>
<p>(10) In the event of fire or carelessness, it can be extinguished with water.</p>
<p>In summary, there is no doubt that alcohol can replace gasoline. Our country's gasoline has always been imported. Once there is a border incident, there will be an immediate panic in power fuel. Therefore, the solution to the gasoline substitute problem is an urgent task. Now that this factory produces a large amount of fine wine, we should try to use it as a gasoline substitute to prevent financial leakage in case of emergency. It is hoped that the people of the country will jointly work on it.</p>

<h3>Yu Tian Preparing for Aftermath; Order Restored at Opium Bridge; Wang Jiji and Others to Be Executed</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Ren, Magistrate of Fengrun County, arrived in Yutian on the 29th to meet with Zhao Congyi and discuss jointly handling the aftermath. Order has been restored at the Ya Hong Bridge. Merchants and residents have returned to the town. A portion resumed business on the 29th. The reorganization of Feng Shoupeng's troops has been completed. The Hebei Provincial Government is scheduled to send personnel on the 5th of next month to conduct an inspection and distribute salaries according to the roster. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After escaping from the Hexi Street of Ya Hong Bridge on the evening of the 24th, Wang Jizong was shot four times along the way. He endured the pain and waded through the water to escape, briefly staying at Ma Zhanfu's home in Dongxuan Hutong. He then went to the home of his in-laws in Daizhuangzi to hide. Unexpectedly, he was reported and captured by the Fengrun Militia on the evening of the 25th. He was escorted to the county government that night. On the afternoon of the 26th, Wang was transported to Yutian by car. Because of the pain from the bullet wounds, he was unable to move. Five other bandits were escorted along with him, all wearing shackles. It is reported that Wang and the five bandits will be executed soon. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zunhua states that many bandits have been discovered at various small passes of the Great Wall recently. The bandits from outside the pass who infiltrated the Panjiakou area have been eliminated by the local security forces, but the losses to the local people are significant. The bandits in Xifengkou and other places were also surrounded and fiercely suppressed by the security forces and militia of Qian'an and Zunhua counties on the 29th. That evening, they fled outside of Xifengkou. A group of Wang Jizong's rebellious militia in Yutian who infiltrated the vicinity of Qian'an and Xinjizhen was also dispersed by the militia. Currently, the situation at various passes of the Great Wall remains extremely stable. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the early morning of the 28th, about 200 bandits suddenly infiltrated Panjiakou on the Great Wall, led by the bandit leader Sun Yongquan. They burned and looted the entire town, destroyed more than 100 houses, seized firearms from the police station, and kidnapped Patrol Officer Zhao Changshun and eleven other hostages. They retreated to Xifengkou. The militia and police of Qian'an pursued them. On the 29th, the bandits retreated outside the pass and fled north along Hai'er Ridge. Patrol Officer Zhao managed to escape during the chaos and returned. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 100 militiamen from Wang Jizong's troops who fled to Da'anlezhuang in Zunhua planned to escape into the Thirty-Two Ridges area of Qian'an County on the 29th. The security forces and militia surrounded them. There was no contact on the 29th. It seems that the rebel troops are waiting for Wang Qingfang's bandits from outside the pass to join them, coordinating internally and externally to break through and escape. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) About 50 remaining troops of Wang Jizong infiltrated Wushuba in Xifengkou on the evening of the 28th. They were intercepted by the Zunhua militia and police. After a fierce battle, they were completely disarmed. Zhou Yuying and Zhao Congyi, the magistrate of Yutian County, jointly issued a proclamation on the 29th, allowing those who blindly followed the rebellious militia to reform. Those who have guns are allowed to hand them over for an official price, and they will not be held accountable. Furthermore, the gentry and people of Yutian are doing their best to guarantee the recruitment and appeasement of Wang Jizong's scattered militiamen. In recent days, more than 100 people have returned to the county for bail. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Representatives of three counties in southern Hebei affected by the Yellow River disaster visited Hu Yuanhui of the Hebei Construction Department on the 31st. Regarding the repair of the Taihang Dyke, they believe that the peach flood and wheat yellow water will arrive one after another, and it may be difficult to stabilize. They earnestly request to first block the Jiugulu mouth of the Shidong section and cut off the flow, then open the Fenglou encirclement dyke, so that the water can enter the main river along the dyke. If reinforcement is not possible in time, the Jin Dyke can be defended firmly. (Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River will change its course and flow through Tai'an. The water in the main river where Li Sheng's village in Shandong is located will be cut off.

The collapse of the county seat of Shou Zhang is especially dangerous. (Telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River Committee telegraphed the provincial government, planning to repair the Jin Dyke, with the section from Huaxian to Gaodikou as the first section, with Zhao Shen's troops as the section chief, and the section from Gaodikou to Taochengpu as the second section, with Wang Zongkui as the section chief.

(Special dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) According to those familiar with the river works, if the Yellow River shifts north, the revetments on the south bank, worth millions, will be useless. The Jin Dyke on the north bank has never had revetments and cannot defend against flooding. If they are added, it will cost millions more, and it is difficult to raise the funds.

<h3>Reading "The Bank of China's 23rd Year Business Report"</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Bank of China compiles and publishes its business report to the public, covering the economic, financial, and trade situation of the past year. This is its sixth publication. From observing its content, the thoroughness of its materials, and the accuracy of its figures, there has been progress year by year, so each is better than the last. What is most commendable is its analysis of the silver and currency issues, with thorough understanding and sound arguments. Its advocacy of establishing and promoting healthy and centralized economic institutions as a remedy for the current difficulties is particularly insightful. Other aspects, such as its deep diagnosis of the unhealthy state of Shanghai's finance, its reasonable prediction of China's international balance of payments in the 23rd year, and its precise analysis of international trade and agricultural and industrial economics, are secondary matters. However, if we were to further examine the issue of national economic production and gain insight into China's current situation, it seems that there are points in the report that could be discussed. I will now briefly present one or two points based on my limited views for the reference of all sectors.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of China's cotton self-sufficiency, the report believes that "in recent years, the area planted with cotton in various places has gradually increased, and the promotion of American varieties has gradually become effective... Who knows whether we cannot achieve self-sufficiency in four or five years?" It also says, "China has traditionally exported 30 to 40 million yuan of coarse cotton. If we can catch up quickly, why can't we change from import surplus to export surplus?" Regarding this observation, in my humble opinion, I feel that it is overly optimistic. Why? In recent years, the gradual effectiveness of the promotion of American varieties is a fairly clear fact. However, cotton mills run by Chinese businessmen still mainly produce coarse yarn. The demand for this kind of fine American cotton is weaker. Although there is a large amount of production, the sales are still mainly to foreign merchants and factories. Furthermore, those ignorant of the national situation engage in monopolistic speculation. When the new cotton was launched last year, it created an abnormally high cotton price. When credit became tight, everyone sought to sell, and the value plummeted to nearly a quarter of the highest price. For example, the fine cotton from Lingbao and Zhengzhou, good quality goods were worth 62 to 63 yuan per dan last year, but recently they have reached 48 to 49 yuan. If we calculate the losses of cotton merchants based on the fact that there are still 150,000 bales in stock (four dan per bale), the losses of cotton merchants will exceed 20 million yuan. And the one bearing the risk is the British-owned bank, not the Chinese one. Conversely, the drop in coarse cotton prices was only two or three yuan because of limited inventory and strong demand. This phenomenon is very noteworthy. How can we make supply and demand suitable in the future? This should be given the most attention. Breaking the deadlock of excess fine cotton should also rely on Chinese factories increasing the spinning of fine yarn. Otherwise, similar incidents of "cheap grain hurting farmers" will soon be seen in the Northwest, and the promotion of American varieties may increase its obstacles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the report expresses deep regret about the decrease in the export of yarn and cement. In fact, the native yarn and cloth exported to Japan and Korea recorded in the customs books are products of Japanese-owned yarn factories in China. This has little relationship with Chinese-owned factories. Also, the export of cement from factories such as Qixin, China, Shanghai, and Guangzhou is very small. Of the so-called 400,000 dan of exports in the 20th year of the Republic of China, most of it was produced by the Dalian Japanese-owned Onoda Cement Company, and the Qingzhou Cement Company in South China also accounted for a part. However, since the establishment of the pseudo-organization in Northeast China, the export figures from Dalian are not seen in the customs books, and the Qingzhou Cement Company has also ceased operations. That is the reality. Therefore, the decrease in these statistical figures does not seem to be sufficient evidence of a particular decline in cement exports.</p>
<p>Overall, the content of this report is generally very satisfactory. What is reflected in reality is the increased effectiveness of the bank's social services. This is what we greatly admire.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Three Koreans Attempt to Assassinate Puyi and Key Japanese and Manchurian Military and Civilian Officials; Japanese Police Conduct Strict Searches on Land and Sea</h3>
<p>(Dalian) Twenty-three Koreans planned to assassinate Puyi and important Japanese and Manchurian military and civilian officials and also had a grand plan of a destructive nature. These individuals belonged to a certain secret group in Shanghai. It is said that they planned to secretly enter Manchuria from various locations by civilian ships. Changchun received a secret report first and ordered all stations to take strict precautions. The police in the Kwantung Leased Territory have been extraordinarily active since receiving this report, and they have been rigorously inspecting suspicious ships on the waters between Dalian and Japan. All passengers entering the port by steamer are also subject to strict inspection. It is reported that Puyi is scheduled to lead 83 attendants to Japan on April 2nd for a formal visit.

<h3>Stalin Receives Eden; British-Russian Relations Greatly Harmonized; Thousands Cheer at Opera House Celebration; British National Anthem and Internationale Played Together</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After continuing talks with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov this morning, the British Lord Privy Seal, Eden, immediately visited Stalin with Litvinov and Molotov. They had a confidential talk for over an hour. This is the first time that the Soviet dictator has directly negotiated with a foreign politician. It is reported that the talks focused on the Far East issue and had a significant impact on the understanding of British and Russian Far East policies. (29th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Litvinov and Eden continued their talks for an hour and a half. The two sides exchanged views on the issues discussed previously and the development of British-Soviet relations. At the same time, they expressed satisfaction with the improvement of relations and discussed ways to further strengthen the political and economic ties between the two countries. Informed sources said that the two men spoke frankly and cooperatively throughout the talks. Afterwards, Molotov and Stalin received Eden and talked for about an hour. In a friendly atmosphere, they exchanged views on international issues related to the two countries and various issues concerning the promotion of British-Soviet relations. The talks were held in Molotov's office. Litvinov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chilston, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky, and the Director of the International Department of the Foreign Affairs Committee Strong were also present. In the evening, Eden and his party, accompanied by Litvinov, Chilston, Maisky, and Krestinsky, went to the Bolshoi Theatre to see a performance of song and dance. When Eden entered the box, the audience applauded enthusiastically, and the orchestra played the British national anthem and the Internationale. (29th TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Eden met with Stalin in the cabinet room of the Executive Yuan for an hour this afternoon, with Litvinov translating. Stalin wore long boots, black trousers, and a gray coat. When the officials gathered, a filmmaker and newspaper photographers were present to take pictures, as this meeting was of historical value and needed to be recorded. As Eden detailed the points discussed with Litvinov, Stalin listened intently, showing great concern. Most of the discussions involved important events in British-Russian relations and maintaining peace and the integrity of China in the Far East. Eden plans to continue talks at Litvinov's villa, 30 miles from Moscow, tomorrow. Tonight, the Moscow Theatre is performing "Swan Lake," and 2,000 people are watching. Eden and his entourage are also enjoying the performance in the former imperial box. When they appeared in the box, the entire theatre stood up and cheered for several minutes. Eden and his entourage smiled and bowed to show their gratitude. The theatre orchestra then played the British national anthem, and the crowd cheered again, followed by the Internationale. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A grand performance was held at the opera house last night to welcome the British Lord Privy Seal, Eden. When Eden arrived at the theatre, thousands of audience members stood up and cheered to express their welcome. At the beginning of the performance, the orchestra first played the British national anthem "God Save the King" and the Third Internationale. A certain British official heard this and smiled, saying, "This is the first sign of the arrival of a new era." Lord Privy Seal Eden, British Ambassador to Russia and Mrs. Chilston, Eden's secretary Lord Cranborne, Counselor of the British Foreign Office Strickland, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, and Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky were all seated in the flower box. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Eden did not hold formal talks with the Russian authorities today, as today is a Soviet holiday. In the morning, he drove to the villa of the Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, 30 miles from here, presumably for informal discussions. Eden's visit to Russia has apparently achieved some results. Eden's attitude is forthright, and those who are close to him are respectful. Many doubts have reportedly been dispelled. Over the past two days, Eden has listened sympathetically to the Russian side's views, and has given practical answers to Soviet concerns about certain aspects of the European situation. According to informed sources, the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to consolidate peace through the League of Nations and international cooperation, which is beyond doubt. Although the authorities have not issued a formal communiqué on the trend and substance of the talks in the past two days, news reporters who accompanied Eden to Russia said that the two sides not only discussed the clauses mentioned in the Anglo-French declaration of February 3, but also involved many events concerning British-Russian relations. Litvinov frankly and comprehensively answered all the points that Eden inquired about regarding Soviet policy in the "exploratory talks." In this regard, Eden's trip can be described as extremely valuable and effective. It is said that Eden's long talk with Stalin yesterday afternoon was also very valuable and important. Eden has scheduled to depart for Warsaw tomorrow night, so he will only stay here for one day. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Proposes a Far East Security Pact to be Signed by Russia, Britain, the United States, and Japan, Aimed at Germany and Japan</h3>
<p>(Moscow) It is rumored here today that Soviet Russia has proposed that Russia, Britain, the United States, and Japan conclude a Far East Security Pact. The proposal is complex, with the main feature being the provision of assistance to Britain in the event of a conflict with Germany. In the proposal, Soviet Russia guaranteed to Britain that if Germany invaded, Soviet Russia would send troops to assist Britain. In the event of a conflict between Japan and Russia, Europe would assist Soviet Russia. It is unknown what position the United States has in this plan, but it is believed that Soviet Russia will demand the same from the United States as it does from Britain. Japan will also be invited to participate in this pact. The pact is virtually equivalent to a military alliance. If Japan refuses this pact, Soviet Russia intends to exclude Japan and form a pact. There is no news as to whether France will be invited to participate, but observers in Moscow believe that Soviet Russia is negotiating another pact with France based on fighting Germany. It is reported that this plan has been submitted to the British Lord Privy Seal, Eden, but Eden's trip is only exploratory and he has no power to negotiate this matter, and British Foreign Secretary Simon has stated to Parliament that the government will not take any action without notifying Parliament. At a grand banquet last night, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov raised a toast to the British monarch, saying that maintaining British-Russian relations is necessary for maintaining world peace. It is reported that Eden and Litvinov discussed commercial issues and the impact of Japan's expansion of power in the Far East on the future of Britain and Russia at their second meeting. (30th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Want to Participate; Still Believes that the Kellogg-Briand Pact is Sufficient to Guarantee World Peace</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is widely rumored that Soviet officials have suggested that the United States, Britain, Soviet Russia, and even Japan conclude a Far East Security Pact. The United States is very indifferent to this. Officials have not made any comments on this, but solemnly stated that the United States does not want to participate in this action. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the United States still adheres to its original policy, that is, if all countries can abide by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, then the pact is sufficient to guarantee world peace. It is said that the United States does not want to sign any pact under any circumstances that would cause the United States military to fight on behalf of others. An official said that the American people cannot agree to this plan, because the policy that the United States has always adhered to is to fight for its own country, and the disputes of other countries are handled by other countries.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry's View: Believes Britain Will Not Do This Out of Consideration for Friendship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to foreign reports, on the second day of the British-Russian talks, the Far East Security Pact was discussed. The Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed the following view on this: According to Russian sources, the British-Russian talks discussed the Far East issue, while London officials announced that the talks only discussed the Eastern European Locarno issue. The content of the two announcements is very different, which is quite noteworthy. In order to prevent Germany, Soviet Russia intends to first conclude a guarantee of Far East security with Japan and vigorously promotes the agreement on this issue with Britain. However, Britain has always been concerned about British-Japanese friendship. The news that Japan was excluded from the discussion of the Far East issue is very unreliable. The Japanese government's policy is not to interfere in European politics and to treat neighboring countries with the principle of threat of non-aggression. Regarding maintaining the Far East issue, there is full confidence and preparation. (30th Japan Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>British-German Negotiations: German Demands; Semi-Official British Report</h3>
<p>(London) Although some newspapers have revealed fragments of the conditions demanded by Germany in the British-German talks, they have not seen the whole picture. Now, based on the various news gathered by the British semi-official sources, a summary of Germany's demands can be obtained. The content is roughly as follows: Regarding armaments, Germany demands parity with British and French air forces, but with a reservation clause, that is, the British and French air forces should be at least equal to the Soviet Union. Regarding the navy, Hitler advocates absolute equality with the French navy. The number of German army regulars is temporarily set at 550,000. Hitler further stated that if the armaments of all countries on the European continent are reduced uniformly, then German armaments should also be reduced in the same proportion. However, if the military strength of the Soviet Union stationed in European territory exceeds German military strength, then Germany still cannot sign a convention on reducing armaments. Regarding territory, Germany acknowledges that the borders with Belgium, the Netherlands, and France are completely determined and will no longer demand changes. However, Germany's eastern border should not be regarded as permanently valid. It is generally believed that Germany did demand the cancellation of the Polish Corridor and the revision of the Czech border, but these two matters can be regarded as the German government's ultimate ambition. Hitler also expressed his willingness to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Lithuania, with the reservation that Lithuania should strictly respect the status of German expatriates. However, diplomatic circles believe that this proposal is a blueprint for Germany to interfere in Lithuania. Regarding the Austrian issue, Hitler insisted that the vast majority of people in Austria advocate annexation by Germany, so the German-Austrian merger is virtually inevitable. It is regrettable that Italy is interfering in Austria's internal affairs. Therefore, all conventions guaranteeing Austria's territorial integrity must stipulate that Italy's power is the same as Germany's, so as not to penetrate Austria. In addition, if the Austrian people express their willingness to merge with Germany, this should also be taken into account in the convention. In addition, Germany is prepared to conclude a Western European mutual assistance pact, but Germany will resolutely reject an Eastern European mutual assistance pact if it includes the Soviet Union. However, the German government suggests that Eastern European countries conclude bilateral treaties with each other, stipulating non-aggression. Finally, Germany also demands colonial rights. If the above conditions are satisfied, Germany can consider returning to the League of Nations. As for the rumors that Hitler proposed concluding an Anglo-German alliance, the British cabinet members did not consider it. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) As a result of the talks between Foreign Minister Laval and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu yesterday, they reached a complete agreement. All newspapers attach great importance to this and believe that Titulescu is one of the most resolute supporters of the Eastern European Locarno Pact. Some newspapers also hope that this pact can be established soon. Le Petit Parisien believes that the European collective security system, which originated from the Anglo-French London memorandum, should be completed quickly, without Germany obstructing it. If the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and the Danube Pact can be established quickly, it is also the best way for all countries to avoid Germany's reckless actions. It is fortunate that France and Romania can fully agree before the Stresa Conference. L'Echo de Paris reported that if France and the Little Entente and the signatory countries of the Balkan Pact want to continue to cooperate effectively, France and Russia must work together to maintain peace. This is indispensable, as the League of Nations is already in danger of collapse without this link. As for the other link, it is the mutual reconciliation between Italy and the Little Entente. Although this level is now showing signs, it has not reached the final stage. This is what French diplomacy should strive for. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Announces Rejection of Direct Negotiations with Italy; Italy Prepares for War; Fear of Impacting the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Abyssinian government's decision to sever direct negotiations with Italy, which was officially announced today, further diminishes the hope of a peaceful resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The Italian side has also ordered the wives and children of officers sent to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to return home immediately. This is enough to suggest that the Italian authorities are deeply concerned that the overall situation will become more serious and that war with Abyssinia will be inevitable. It is reported that the Abyssinian government has requested that the dispute between the two countries be submitted to arbitration. The Italian government only agrees to this as a last resort. Non-official opinions are that the establishment of an arbitration committee will be presided over by the League of Nations. However, today it is not easy to form a committee whose judgment can bind Italy. At the same time, many Italian newspapers have published articles saying that what Italy is concerned about now is not only the war threat in Africa, but also the possibility of another great war in Europe.

<h3>Italy Rushes to Manufacture Munitions; Distributed to Various Armies in Spring</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Undersecretary of the Army, General Fister Roccchi, gave a speech in the Senate today, describing Italy's war preparations, saying: "War products are now being manufactured as quickly as possible. Bombs, hand grenades, cannons, and machine guns are now being produced in a steady stream and can be distributed to the various armies by spring. The materials needed by the artillery units are also being quickly increased as needed by the rapidly changing situation." Pester indicated that a new Army Committee would be established in the near future, and also said that no one can predict when war will break out. After a period of political tension, there is a risk of sudden outbreaks within a few days. Furthermore, it is impossible to shorten the term of military service as discussed. The army must also be reorganized. All Italian citizens must be able to receive national military education. Peyster concluded that the valleys that were used to invade Italy in the past have now been blocked and are heavily guarded, solid and inviolable. By spring, Italy will have a fully armed army of approximately 600,000 men. In addition, there are approximately 300,000 reservists from the 1912 class. The government is currently drafting a plan to expedite the recruitment of officers into the army for training. This is enough to show that Italy is now strictly preparing its military to prevent war. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>France Increases Troops on the Border; Will Also Ask Britain to Express its Attitude</h3>

An Associated Press reporter learned that France is now strengthening the strength of its colonial troops at home, because Premier Flandin now believes that continuing discussions on disarmament with Germany is useless.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>(Moscow) An editorial in the Izvestia newspaper commented on the Eastern European Regional Mutual Assistance Pact, saying, "German fascist newspapers, in order to find a basis for their opposition to this pact, are trying to conceal it and point out that this pact is an abominable conspiracy of French diplomacy, the purpose of which is to oppose Germany." The newspaper further stated that this pact must include all Eastern European countries, and at the same time stipulate that any country must provide joint assistance if it is attacked. The newspaper proves that the contradictions between countries are increasing, and armaments are increasing. At the same time, the governments of various countries have stated that they do not attach importance to simple non-aggression pacts, so such pacts can never give people a sense of security. As for the concept of the Eastern European Regional Mutual Assistance Pact, it arose from the fact that German imperialism is recklessly promoting its rearmament and the aggressive policies of the German National Socialist Party. Some say that the Eastern European Pact is a secret and complex diplomatic tool that is not seen by the diplomatic world. The newspaper vehemently denies this statement, and said that in essence, there is no difference between the Locarno Treaty, the Western Sky Pact, and the proposal of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. The newspaper further discussed Germany's and Poland's opposition to the Eastern Pact, saying, "Anyone can say that if Germany and Poland have aggressive plans, then they have reason to prevent the conclusion of this pact. If they want to dispel this kind of distrust, then they must agree to conclude this pact." The newspaper continued, "When the Eastern European Pact was being negotiated, Germany was vigorously expanding its armaments, and at the same time, German fascist cadres publicly put forward a plan in the People's Observer to sacrifice the Soviet Baltic countries and the Little Entente, so that the entire territory would change today. On one side, Poland was suggested to launch this proposal. These texts strongly stated that this attack will be directed at France. Therefore, the countries that are the targets of such plans must rise up and conclude regional mutual assistance pacts. At the same time, this pact must be open to all countries that are willing to join. Those who are unwilling to join, although they are exposing their own purposes, can never weaken the importance of this weapon of peace," said the TASS dispatch.</p>

<h3>British Government Permits Cruiser to Carry Our Antiquities to London for Exhibition</h3>
<p>(London) The British government has agreed to allow the cruiser HMS Suffolk to sail from the Far East to Portsmouth in mid-June with Chinese art treasures. These treasures will be exhibited in London. The reason for using warships for transportation is to prevent unexpected dangers, and the insurance premiums paid by the organizers of the exhibition can also be greatly reduced.

<h3>London Times Praises Our Country's Art</h3>
<p>(London) The Times said in an editorial today about the exhibition of Chinese paintings at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, saying that watching Chinese paintings has something that amazes people. Although China has suffered many hardships, its wisdom and beauty can still be seen in its modern paintings. This quality is particularly evident in the exhibition organized by the Chinese artist Liu Haisu. The solemnity, poetry, and life that the Chinese people treasure are all filled in the paintings, and they are not slightly different due to changes in the situation and communism and Japanese aggression. They express their feelings with gentle and tranquil brushes. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Says European Situation is Unstable; Enhances Japan's Position</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun said that the United States has not expressed a clear intention regarding Germany's abandonment of the military clauses of the peace treaty. President Roosevelt is wary of causing Germany's reaction if he expresses his intention, given the situation in Manchuria where Japan had incidents in the past. The U.S. foreign policy still avoids entering into the vortex of European disputes, so Washington officials are also deeply considering the impact of Germany's actions on the Far East. The attitude of the United States is to maintain the prestige of the United States and seek equal opportunities for commerce. On the one hand, since the United Kingdom and Russia turned their attention from the Far East to various problems in the European continent, Japan's position in the Far East has gradually become superior. In addition, with the conclusion of the Sino-Eastern Railway transfer negotiation and the improvement of Japanese-Russian relations, Washington believes that Russia, Belgium, and France are most directly threatened by Germany's abandonment of the treaty and rearmament. Therefore, Russia has to establish friendly relations with Japan. This means that the instability of the European political situation enhances Japan's position.</p>

<h3>Belgian House of Representatives Passes Bill to Abandon Gold Standard and Devalue Currency</h3>
<p>Brussels – The House of Representatives today passed a bill to abandon the gold standard. The bill has been sent to the Senate for final approval. It is said that the success or failure of the Zeeland government hinges on the Senate vote. If the Senate rejects the plan to devalue the Belgian currency, the government will immediately resign. However, officials insist that the Senate will approve the government's plan. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the government's plan by a vote of 107 to 54, and also voted to extend the government's special powers for one year, giving the government an opportunity to deal with the financial crisis. When the government submits its currency plan to the Senate, it will take extraordinary measures, requiring the Senate to cast a vote of confidence before voting on the bill. If the vote opposes the government, the government will immediately resign, and King Leopold will order the formation of a new cabinet. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Brussels – This morning, the House of Representatives passed the currency devaluation bill by a vote of 107 to 54, with 12 abstentions. The debate on the bill began yesterday afternoon and did not end until 6 a.m. this morning. Former Prime Minister Jaspar and Prime Minister Zeeland debated each other. Jaspar said that the United States' experiments with currency devaluation should not be imitated by Belgium. Once the currency is devalued, the resulting drawbacks will inevitably lead to inflation. In 1926, the Belgian currency was devalued once. Announcing a devaluation again at this time will only cause social unrest. Once the currency price is lowered, it will be impossible to stabilize it. Jaspar also said that in 1926, the value of the Belgian currency had already been reduced by six-sevenths, and the government at that time had made a promise to correct it. Recently, the French government agreed to lend Belgium a huge sum of 300 million francs at an annual interest rate of 3.5% to maintain the exchange rate, but the Belgian government refused, which is somewhat strange. Prime Minister Zeeland then rose to answer, saying that the current problem should focus on the economic situation. The outflow of cash from Belgium is not the work of international speculators, but the work of Belgians. "This is why former Prime Minister Theunis refused the French loan proposal." Zeeland believes that after the currency devaluation, if the prices of goods slowly rise, the value of various industries that have fallen too much will inevitably return to their true value.

<h3>Dutch Government Actively Reducing Budget</h3>

<h3>US Believes Belgian Actions are Still Moderate</h3>
<p>(Washington) – Secretary of State Hull today expressed his opinion on the Belgian currency situation, saying that in his view, the Belgian currency devaluation plan is still moderate and will not make the competitive situation more dangerous. However, if the result of the Belgian currency devaluation is to subject the United States to unfair competition, the United States will take necessary measures to remedy it. Currently, gold worth 25 million yuan is being transported from Amsterdam and Paris to New York. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) – Officials today announced that Belgium's currency devaluation plan will not affect the Belgian-American commercial treaty. It is reported that Washington officials do not believe that the devaluation of the Belgian currency will deal a major blow to commerce, but a clause in the commercial treaty stipulates that if changes in currency damage the commerce of either country, the treaty may be amended. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) – Semi-official sources stated that Belgium's financial panic is bringing the world closer to currency stability, but some believe that before the world is ready to stabilize currencies, France, Poland, Switzerland, and Belgium will specifically abandon the gold standard. It is said that, apart from this, Belgium's current situation has very little impact on the financial and economic situation of the United States. The financial community unanimously acknowledges that international currency stability is still far away. The world market will have an opportunity to adjust currencies due to Belgium's financial panic. Financiers do not believe that Belgium's actions will trigger a world currency war. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Impact of Belgian Currency Devaluation on Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) – After Belgium reduced its currency price by 25%, a concrete policy for stabilizing exchange rates has not yet been established. As a result of this currency price reduction, whether the Belgian currency can be stabilized and what the fate of gold standard countries will be are issues that Japanese financial circles are paying attention to. According to the Ministry of Finance's view, although Belgium itself will inevitably be in chaos for a while, it will soon be stabilized and will have no direct impact on Japan. Otherwise, how the impact on the Netherlands and France will be is related to Japan, and special vigilance will be given to this. That is, if Belgium implements currency price reduction and temporarily suspends the gold standard, and the Netherlands, which has close ties with Belgium, reduces its currency price, then Japan's trade with the Dutch East Indies will inevitably be directly hit. At the same time, it will have a significant impact on the gold standard group. Although France is maintaining a cautious attitude, not only can the world's currency stability not be expected, but it will also increase its complexity in the future. (United News Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Regarding the impact of the Belgian currency price reduction on the gold standard group, the following is the observation of the exchange bank: When the gold standard alliance collapses, there will be an opportunity to stabilize international exchange rates. Therefore, international exchange rates will be highly competitive, and there is a possibility that they will intensify. Where the capital of the Netherlands and Switzerland flows is a matter of great attention. It is noted that funds generally do not flow into Paris, or are converted into pounds, promoting the rise of British-American and British-French exchange rates. In the event that gold is purchased from London, causing gold prices to rise, the pound price will fall instead. If funds flow to the United States, it will cause the British-American exchange rate to fall, and its indirect impact will cause the Japanese exchange rate against the US to rise or fall.

<h3>German Exports Will Be Severely Hit</h3>
<p>(Berlin) – A leading member of the German Steel Industry Federation told a Reuters correspondent today that the devaluation of the Belgian franc will deal a major blow to German exports. Germany's difficult position in the world market will become more serious in the future. However, the International Crude Steel Federation will hold a meeting in Paris tomorrow, and it may be possible to negotiate a solution. Belgium is also a member. When the issue of extending the contract is raised for discussion, there is hope that a solution will be reached. Today, inquiries were made to the Deutsche Bank, and it was said that Germany does not want to follow in Belgium's footsteps, and it is understood that the German government is unlikely to approve of state subsidies being given to the German steel export industry.

<h3>Mei Lanfang's Drama Intoxicates Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) – Mei Lanfang's troupe's performance in Moscow has ended. Tens of thousands of people watched it. Its success is rare for foreign troupes performing in the Soviet Union. After each performance, the audience constantly applauded warmly, welcoming the troupe's actors, especially Mr. Mei's excellent skills. Dr. Mei told reporters that he and his colleagues deeply felt that there was a kind of contact and eternal emotional exchange between them and the audience. Although the Soviet audience was ignorant of the Chinese language and the unique customs of Chinese drama, they were ultimately captivated by Mei's troupe. The Moscow newspapers paid special attention to Mr. Mei's performance. The major newspapers published almost daily reviews, news, and various short articles about the troupe's performance. The Pravda called its performance a joyful festival in the theater world, a cultural joyful festival to welcome this great artist Mei Lanfang. Mr. Mei should of course be included in the world's greatest art circles. Today, films will be made of some of Mei's troupe's scripts. In the future, a set of films dedicated to Mei Lanfang's troupe will be made. Tomorrow, Mr. Mei will meet with Stanislavsky, the Soviet Union's greatest artist and director. On the 31st of this month, Mr. Mei will leave for Leningrad to perform. (TASS Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>New York State Bans Divorce Cases: New York Men Deceived by Beauty Scams, Extortion Compensation Exceeds Tens of Millions</h3>
<p>(New York) – New York Governor Lehman signed a bill today to ban divorce cases in New York State because someone often uses abandonment as a tool for extortion. From now on, women in New York State may not accuse men of infidelity or abandonment and demand monetary compensation. In other words, if a man's love breaks down and he wants freedom, the so-called fiancée cannot demand money as a substitute for love. If this happens, the woman can be charged with fraud and fined 1,000 to 5,000 yuan, or imprisoned for one to ten years. Therefore, there will be no more cases of men being accused of divorce or seduction. According to Mike Nabber, the initiator of this case, it is estimated that New York men have been defrauded out of no less than 10 million yuan by beauty scams. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>Illegal Militia in Yutian Resolved by Security Team; Zhou Yuying's Troops Suppress Militia; Wang Jizong's Troops Collapsed and Were Captured</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The illegal militia led by Wang Jizong in Yutian has been completely resolved on the 26th. In addition to a batch of firearms that have been seized, the more than 400 bandits under Liu Guitang were led by the bandit leaders Wang Hanxi, Mai Wenge, and others to flee towards the Zunhua border, intending to join forces with the Liu bandit troops led by Wang Qingfang and Zhang Hanmin, who were returning from outside Xifengkou, and escape towards the northern border of Qian'an. The Zunhua and Qian'an militias and security teams are currently searching and suppressing them. Because the bandit troops carried several machine guns from the militia and had sufficient ammunition and equipment, it was not easy to encircle and wipe them out. The militias and security teams from Ji County and Yutian County guarded Yan Exit and Jieling Exit on the 26th to prevent the bandit troops from escaping, causing the five counties of Zunhua, Fengrun, Yutian, Ji County, and Jizhou to be in a state of tension. Wang Jizong himself, after being fiercely attacked by the security team on the 25th and 26th, and his troops were killed and dispersed, disguised himself as a farmer and fled from Qianjiagou to Fengrun County, hiding in Daizhuangzi. At noon on the 26th, he was searched by the Fengrun militia in Xinjuntun Town and Huangwuxinzhuang. At that time, Wang had been seriously injured in four places and did not resist. He was immediately captured. On the 27th, he was escorted to the Yutian County government for detention and will be escorted to the Peiping Military Branch for interrogation within a few days. As for the defense area of Wang Jizong in Ya Hongqiao, it was taken over by two companies of the security team led by Zhou Yuying on the 26th. Although local order has not been restored, the fires in the streets have been completely extinguished. The security team is searching the houses of the militia to prevent further trouble. This time, the security team advanced to suppress the militia after Wang Jizong's troops refused to be reorganized. Zhou Yuying went to the Peiping Military Branch to ask for instructions. He Yingqin ordered the use of force to resolve the matter. On the one hand, Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin to contact the Japanese side and was allowed to transport eight heavy machine guns for use. At noon on the 24th, the security team set off, led by Deputy Chief Wang, and advanced to Niugezhuang, three miles north of Ya Hongqiao. The headquarters was set up in Zhongjie. He Jinjia, the chief of the Ya Hongqiao Public Security Sub-bureau, and Liu Shenzhi, the chief of the police station, shuttled back and forth to persuade Wang's troops to surrender their weapons without resorting to force. However, after nine trips back and forth, there were still no results. Liu Guitang, the leader of the bandit troops, and Jia Wenge saw that Wang Jizong's attitude was wavering and suddenly led the crowd to threaten the militia headquarters, ordering Wang Jizong to order the distribution of militia firearms and machine guns to resist. Wang had no choice but to openly resist with the crowd. At 2 a.m. on the 25th, a conflict broke out. One branch of the security team crossed the Huanxiang River and arrived at the east of Ya Hongqiao, and confronted the militia in the South Street across the river from the Beida Temple along the river embankment to the North Street. At about 3 o'clock, the battle broke out, and the sound of gunfire was like popping beans. The residents were all lying in their rooms, holding their breath and daring not to go out. At 5 a.m., the militia was unable to support itself. More than 30 people broke through and fled. At that time, a fire broke out outside the North Gate and West Gate. A security team rushed to the West Gate. The bandits inside could not support themselves and divided into several branches, led by Wang Jizong, Jia Wenge, and Wang Hanxi, and broke through along the Miaojia of the Huanxiang River, shouting to the security team not to attack the retreating ones. As soon as the security team hesitated, the bandits managed to wade across the river and escape. At that time, there were many casualties and injuries from machine gun fire. After the security team entered the street, they searched the houses and found many bandit corpses, which were temporarily carried and buried by the residents of the town. In the afternoon, the security team divided their troops to pursue them. Jia Wenge, Wang Hanxi, and the bandit troops fled to Lijiaqiao, Zhao Jiapu, Miaozhuangzi, and Lizhuang. The security team chased and captured the bandit leader Ma Zhanfu at Miaozhuangzi, and took advantage of the victory to pursue closely. The bandits could not gain a foothold and fled to the Zunhua border. The Wang Jizong troops, then retreated to Qianjiagou and Lijia'ying, with more than 600 remnants, actually dug trenches in Lijia'ying and Qianjiagou to fight like trapped beasts, and exhausted the food in the village in advance as a plan for a long-term defense. At 3 a.m. on the 26th, the security team besieged them with all their strength. The militia used three mortars as their main force and stubbornly resisted. After six hours of fierce fighting, they were unable to support themselves until 9 a.m. and set fire to Qianjiagou to escape. Before leaving, they kidnapped more than 30 villagers, men and women. Wang Jizong then disguised himself and fled to Fengrun, separated from the troops. Now, the gentry of Ya Hongqiao believe that the militia members of Wang's troops are all good family children who were forced to join the army. Now that Wang has been arrested, the law does not punish the many. Therefore, they have all provided bail and are willing to persuade the militia to surrender their weapons and return, and hope that the security team will no longer pursue them. Zhou Yuying has already approved it. (March 28)</p>
<h3>Hengfeng, Jiangxi to Build Pagoda of Bones; After the Recovery of Hengfeng, Corpses are Exposed Everywhere</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Hengfeng in eastern Jiangxi, like Ruijin in southern Jiangxi, was once the base of the communist bandits. It has been verified that Hengfeng has been used as a nest by bandits on the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui for five or six years. The depth of the bandit disaster and the number of people killed are the highest in eastern Jiangxi, western Zhejiang, and southern Anhui. However, the place has not been recovered for a long time, and corpses are exposed everywhere, with white bones supporting them, which is probably more than the hills of white bones in the Fengyuting and other places in Ningdu and Ruijin. Currently, the military and political authorities plan to build a pagoda of bones in Hengfeng, collecting and gathering white bones from various places in the pagoda, on the one hand to commemorate the tragic bandit disaster in the past, and on the other hand to warn the future not to let bandit disasters occur again. After this bone pagoda is built, it will be permanently used for people to pay their respects.</p>

<h3>A Record of Inspection in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Evil Customs of Wuwei and General Conditions in the Western Route</p>
<p>The Western Route of Gansu Province is culturally backward, and the evil custom of foot-binding has not been eliminated in many places. In Jiuquan and the three counties outside the pass, there are still quite a few women with natural feet. In counties such as Gaotai, Linze, and Wuwei, one can often see young girls with newly bound feet. Especially in villages such as Sishilibao in Wuwei, stores selling sundries hang up and sell embroidered shoes and wooden soles, and there are quite a few buyers, indicating that the custom of foot-binding is still prevalent. Wherever a car rumbles past, women with bound feet hear the sound and come out to watch, walking with difficulty, always using a female companion to help them along, otherwise, they forcefully grab outward with both hands to support their weight, swaying with each step, as if they are about to fall. Moreover, women with bound feet come from very old-fashioned families, adhering to the ancient teachings of "not leaving the main gate and not strolling outside the second gate." There are even incidents where "a nephew visited his uncle's house for the New Year and his new clothes were torn by a dog, but the women of the uncle's family would not lightly come out to take care of him." Also, if one knocks on the door and asks if anyone is home, and there are no men in the family, the female relatives will definitely answer "no one," as if women are not people. Examples of this kind of atmosphere are too numerous to list. According to Du Jingshan, a friend from Lintao, the entrenched customs of southern Gansu are even worse than those of the Western Route. The resulting weak bodies and weak offspring are extremely harmful. As for education in Wuwei, the county-run schools include two senior elementary schools and four junior elementary schools in the city, one women's school, two senior elementary schools outside the city, and dozens of junior elementary schools. There are also two or three primary and secondary schools established by churches. The number cannot be said to be small. If the educational circles can be responsible for promoting this foot-binding eradication movement, the results will be considerable. It is deeply hoped that the local intellectual class will resolutely take on the responsibility of changing customs.</p>
<p>Wuwei is 190 li from east to west and 410 li from north to south (of which the southern mountain range occupies 270 li). There are more than 11,000 qing of cultivable land and a population of approximately 220,000. Opium is a special product, and its high price is a major source of income for the county and the center of opium in the Western Route. Every time there is a wedding fair, merchants gather and opera troupes and prostitutes come together, making the commerce suddenly prosperous, which is unprecedented in the Western Route. Once the wedding fair is over, it suddenly becomes deserted again. The flourishing of this poisonous herb means that along the way, one sees mostly gaunt figures addicted to opium. It is said that the number of men who smoke opium accounts for about 50%, and women are fewer, but still account for about 30%. When visiting homes at night, most middle-aged and elderly couples are lying on the kang (heated brick bed), smoking opium by the light, and each spits into a bowl. When they see a guest arrive, they only say "sit down" and slightly retract their legs, then continue to suck the opium as before. Distant guests feel deeply shocked, but the locals see it as a common occurrence. Poverty and weakness follow the harm of opium. When pawning is exhausted, they do not hesitate to sell their wives and daughters. Therefore, the trade in human beings is also particularly rampant. No matter in the city or countryside, human traffickers who sell women are everywhere. Usually, girls under the age of 14 are given a few yuan of silver for each year of their age (the price of child brides in the Western Route counties is also often based on this standard). Those aged 15 or 16 to 21 or 22 are sold for dozens or hundreds of yuan. After the sale, they either become fallen women or maids in wealthy families (many of the maids kept by officials and wealthy merchants in various counties of Gansu are from Wuwei). The authorities should strictly ban these evil customs and punish human traffickers to the fullest extent of the law. However, the fundamental solution lies in banning opium as soon as possible, abolishing exorbitant taxes, and ensuring that people do not have to worry about cold and hunger, so that they will not sell their sons and daughters.</p>
<p>The counties of the Western Route of Gansu are vast in area, and except for a very small number of deserts, most are fertile lands suitable for both agriculture and animal husbandry. They occupy an important part of the province. The terrain stretches for 2,000 li from east to west. Except for a few short mountain roads, such as Zhujiajing, Wushaling, Shuiquanyi, and Xiakouzhen, totaling about 200 li, the rest is mostly plains. For transportation, whether traveling from Lanzhou to Xinjiang, Qinghai to Zhangye, or Baoning to Ganliang, one can build railways along the main road for carriages. The long-distance buses that currently run also mainly use the post road.</p>
<p>The soil from Lanzhou to Yongdeng is white soil, and the water is very deep, especially in the Yujiawan area, which is extremely dry. Yongdeng to Wushaling is known for its horses and sheep, and is all grassland. The land between Gulang, Wuwei and Yongchang is flat, with cultivation and wilderness interspersed. The counties of Shandan, Dongle, Zhangye, Linze, and Gaotai have intersecting canals and fertile land, especially Gaotai and Linze. From Gaotai to Jiuquan, Jinta and Dingxin, except for the areas near the city which have water conservancy, most of the rest is sandy and barren land. The three counties of Andunyu are vast in area, comparable to Zhejiang Province, but mostly desert. Where the Sulai River and Dang River provide water conservancy, the land is also quite fertile. Because the counties are close to the Qilian and Qinghai-Mongolian plateaus, the climate is colder.</p>
<p>Before the 15th year of the Republic [1926], due to timely rain and snow, the snow in Qilian melted into rivers in the summer, which irrigated the fields of Jiuquan and Zhangye, and because the land was vast and the population sparse, the harvest was relatively abundant, and life was still prosperous. It was only due to laziness that they did not know how to build water conservancy. After the 17th and 18th years of the Republic [1928-29], they often suffered severe droughts, with little snow in the mountains and weak river water. Each year, the harvest was less than half, and the farmers' lives suddenly felt difficult. From now on, in order to help the rural areas, it is urgent to quickly explore rivers and broaden water sources. In counties such as Gaotai, Anxi, and Dunhuang, one can see springs three feet below the ground, making it particularly convenient to dig wells to irrigate the fields.</p>
<p>The main products are wheat, millet, and opium. Gaotai cotton and Zhangye rice are also quite famous. Yongdeng, Minqin, Shuichang, and Shandan counties are rich in cattle, sheep, camels, and horses, especially the Yongsheng Chakouyi horses are the best. In addition, there is Yumen petroleum, Wucheng rhubarb, Jiuquan Suzhou stones, Shandan lambskins, Qishu mountain gold, stone coal, and asbestos. West of Wushaling, coal is produced everywhere, and Minqin also produces smokeless coal, all of which are famous treasures of the Western Route.</p>
<p>The rural economy of the counties was quite stable before the 15th year of the Republic [1926], with good harvests and light taxes. Later, due to the earthquake in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], the drought in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic [1928-29], and the disturbances of soldiers and bandits, the taxes were heavy. Opium, which was known as a special product, sold well in Tianjin and the Northeast in previous years. The income from one year's production and sales could be used for two years. Now that the Northeast has fallen, hot goods are sold to Tianjin, and Western goods cannot be transported to the East. The source of economic income has become stagnant. The general population has no clothes to change between cold and heat, and cannot sustain a diet of gruel. The land is heavily taxed and the price has fallen, with sellers but no buyers. High interest rates are as high as 10%, and there is still no way to borrow money. Local bullies in the county collude with officials to exploit the people in various ways. Therefore, the people cannot make a living, and many abandon their fields and flee, and the population decreases year by year, which is not a good sign for the future.</p>
<h3>Guantai Breach Blocking Responsibility - Disaster Victims Plead with Central Government to Severely Punish Negligent Personnel</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Yellow River breached at Changyuan last year, the disasters in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have been extremely tragic. The counties in western Shandong, because they are located downstream, have suffered particularly severe disasters. The disaster victims have repeatedly appealed, but the breach has not been blocked. In addition to their resentment, the disaster victims have thought about the issue of responsibility. Yesterday, Yue Chongjue and other representatives of disaster victims from Shouzhang specially sent a telegram to the Central Government, requesting that the negligent personnel of the river works be severely punished to correct the discipline. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, Executive Yuan President Wang, and Supervisory Yuan President Yu: Last year, the Yellow River breached at Changyuan. Sun Qingze, the director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, neglected river works and was negligent in prevention. The personnel responsible for blocking and repairing the Guantai breach have repeatedly delayed the work, resulting in a huge disaster. Negligence endangers the people and should not be forgiven. According to the Dagong Bao, Commissioner Ru Lin said that the Guantai breach was only six meters deep last winter, and someone offered to contract the blocking work for only 6,000 yuan, but the person in charge deliberately shelved it, which is extremely hateful. Rumor has it that the river workers are extremely greedy, which is now confirmed. We earnestly request that these negligent river workers be sentenced to death according to Chinese law to correct the discipline. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. Yue Chongjue, Bai Jingwen, Jiang Zunhui, and other representatives of disaster victims from Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, respectfully kowtow (28th)."</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Increases Salt Tax by Two Yuan Per Dan - Ministry of Finance Telegraphs Jiangxi to Cancel</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the outbreak of banditry in Jiangxi Province, the income from land taxes and various other taxes has decreased year by year, while the expenditures for suppression and reconstruction have gradually increased. It could still be maintained with the support of central government subsidies and the proceeds from the bandit suppression and reconstruction production and sales tax. However, since the reduction of miscellaneous taxes and the unification of the team expenses of the various counties last year, there has been a huge difference in income and expenditure. In addition, due to this year's reduction in central government subsidies and various other reasons, income cannot meet expenses, totaling nearly one million yuan. Therefore, the authorities have specially added a tax of two yuan per dan on salt. Since salt was unified under the central government for tax collection, the local government could not increase any taxes. However, Jiangxi Province has two additional taxes on salt due to special circumstances: road construction, bandit suppression, and reconstruction, which amount to several million yuan per year. Now, another two yuan has been added, and its purpose is to be used for team expenses. After this tax is implemented, the price of each catty of salt will increase by 80 wen. Previously, one yuan could buy seven catties and four taels, but now it can only buy six catties and a half. The Ministry of Finance believes that the local government cannot increase the number of salt stoves, which hinders the salt administration. It is reported that a telegram has been sent to Jiangxi, ordering it to be cancelled immediately. However, the authorities believe that at a time when large-scale communist bandits have just been quelled, team expenses are extremely tight, and they must not allow military pay to be unpaid, which would affect the self-defense forces. They have telegraphed the various difficulties to the Ministry of Finance, and it is feared that the cancellation will not be realized. (March 27)</p>
<h3>Four Provinces Farmers Bank to be Renamed on April 1 - Total Capital Decided to be Increased to Ten Million Yuan - Branches to be Established in Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Shaanxi Provinces - Rural Financial Relief Office to be Closed Immediately</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi was established in April of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] by order of Chairman Chiang. Since its opening, it has been operating smoothly for two years in promoting rural relief work. In addition to the head office in Hankou, branches have been established in Zhengzhou, Wuhu, Nanchang, Shashi, and Hankou, and offices have been established in Yichang, Jiujiang, Kaifeng, Luan, Anqing, and Huangchuan, cooperating with the rural financial relief offices of the four provinces. Later, it expanded the scope of relief and extended it to other provinces besides Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, establishing branches in Lanzhou and Shanghai, and offices in Xi'an, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. The business is developing day by day. Recently, Chairman Chiang visited Hankou, and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi was invited to come for thorough discussions on rural relief. It was determined that the Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces needed to be expanded and decided to rename it "China Farmers Bank," to be implemented on April 1. Preparations are being made actively, and a board of directors and supervisors meeting has been held in Shanghai, electing Kong Xiangxi as chairman of the board. The total capital of the bank has been increased to ten million yuan, with five million yuan fully paid, which is raised by the provincial governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Hunan. After the head office is renamed, the offices in Xi'an and Fuzhou will be changed to branches. Personnel will be sent to Changsha, Chongqing, and Guiyang to establish branches, and to Tianshui, Ankang, and Nanzheng to establish offices. The previously established rural financial relief offices of the four provinces are no longer necessary and have been ordered by the headquarters to close at the end of this month, to be merged into the Farmers Bank and the cooperative committees of each province. All staff members will be transferred and assigned to handle the bank's main business, which is to guide rural cooperation, promote the warehouse system, handle grain transportation, and develop secured lending. Regarding rural cooperation, various cooperatives are the rafts for farmers and banks to establish supply and demand relationships. In the past, 790 societies were established under the guidance of the bank in the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, engaging in investigation and lending. In the future, it will be popularized throughout the country. Regarding the promotion of the warehouse system, agricultural warehouses have been established in Qiaokou in Hankou, Huang'an in Hubei, Hukou and Nanchang in Jiangxi, Congyang in Anhui, and Xinxiang in Henan to handle grain storage. Regarding grain transportation, a contract has been signed with the Jiangxi Grain Administration to lend 500,000 yuan to manage grain control, and the Jiangxi branch has organized a grain storage and transportation department to purchase 200,000 shi of rice in Ji'an, Fuzhou, and other places to provide relief to other counties, transporting surpluses to make up for deficiencies. Regarding secured lending, farmers' mortgage loan offices have been set up in various places to lend money to farmers at low interest rates, only accepting agricultural products and ordinary clothing, and not accepting Western suits or luxury goods. Granting loans to commercial pawnshops is conditional. Although running various cooperatives is a fundamental solution, farmers are unsophisticated and may not easily connect with cooperatives. Pawnshops are familiar to farmers, so guiding them based on the situation is also a way to remedy this. The past work has been like this, and future plans will be no different, except that the scope will be slightly expanded. (29th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Discusses His Impressions of Inspecting Central Anhui - The Post-Disaster Meeting Made Specific Decisions</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In the past, central Anhui suffered from famine, and disturbances by starving people once occurred between Hefei and Chaohu. The provincial government dispatched a large army to suppress and quell the unrest. Liu Zhenhua believes that after the famine, it is urgent to properly plan for post-disaster recovery. In the middle of this month, he accompanied Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner Miao Peicheng and Civil Construction Presidents Ma Lingfu and Liu Yiyan to Hefei to hold a post-disaster meeting in central Anhui. He then inspected various counties in northern Anhui and re-surveyed tobacco seedlings. Yesterday afternoon (28th), he returned to Anqing from Bengbu via Pukou on the Anfeng cruise ship. At about 5 o'clock, he passed through Wuhu and docked, summoning important military and political officials to inquire about the security situation after the suppression of bandits in southern Anhui. According to Liu's speech, the main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Purifying the Countryside and Providing Disaster Relief: The post-disaster conference in central Anhui held in Hefei was attended by the commissioners of the Third and Fourth Administrative Regions, the county magistrates of twelve counties including Hefei, Chaohu, Shucheng, Fengyang, and Huaiyuan, and the captain of the Chaohu Maritime Public Security Corps. The three-day meeting discussed concrete measures for both purifying the countryside and providing disaster relief. Regarding purifying the countryside, Ge Yunlong, the commander of the bandit suppression forces in central Anhui, ordered the county magistrates to strictly search for scattered bandits and, at the same time, to strengthen the baojia organization and implement joint liability. If bandits are not reported in an area, all baojia leaders will be jointly punished. As for disaster relief, the county magistrates will find ways to purchase seeds locally and distribute them to farmers to restore spring planting. The provincial government will allocate disaster relief funds and food to severely affected areas, repair rivers and build roads, and use labor as a form of disaster relief. In addition to the previously stipulated Huayang River, Chaohu Lake, and Pai River projects, another 2,000 workers have been recruited in Shikou, Hefei, to dredge the entrance. This place is an important waterway for Chaohu Lake. In the past, when the water dried up in winter, ships had to be towed by cattle, which made transportation very inconvenient. Moreover, the recruited river dredging workers are from the poor people of Hefei, Chaohu, and other counties, so the hidden dangers in central Anhui have been eliminated invisibly.</p>
<p>Banning Tobacco Seedlings: The counties in central Anhui have always been areas for tobacco production. This year, because the ban was issued early, it is fortunate that only a few people planted it. Even if it was found, it was only mixed among beans and wheat. Commissioners have been assigned to survey and thoroughly remove it. At the same time, the counties have been ordered to find ways to increase production. However, crops such as wheat, beans, and vegetables in the counties of Shulu, Heshou, and Fengyang, which were passed during the inspection, were damaged by snow and hail last week, and the harvest in the future may inevitably be damaged. (9th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: The Land Bureau Will Begin Registration</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the county's land bureau, Director Zhu Zhangqi has made great efforts in planning surveying and mapping. Currently, the surveying and mapping of various districts has been largely completed. According to the procedures, land registration will be carried out to clarify property rights and boundaries. It is learned that the land registration office will be established on April 15, starting with the Xinzhuang district of this county. After the district is completed, other districts will be handled in succession, with the aim of completing the work in the shortest possible time, issuing property ownership certificates, and providing assistance to those managing their property.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Tiger Hill - Strictly Limited Time to Arrest Murderers in Brutal Murder Case</h3>
<p>On the 25th, an unidentified male corpse with 17 knife wounds and a right arm that had been chopped off was discovered in the Lower Pond River in Tiger Hill outside Tumen. After the District Procuratorate dispatched personnel to inspect the body, the local security was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and wait for family members to claim the body, and to arrest the murderers. The day before yesterday, a chopped-off arm was found near the site. The District Procuratorate dispatched personnel to inspect it. Zhang Hanwei, the director of the Public Security Bureau, paid close attention to the case, believing that the police district in charge was negligent in prevention beforehand and allowed the murderers to escape afterwards, which was difficult to excuse. Yesterday (30th), he ordered the detective team and various branches to arrest the murderers within one week and investigate the case. According to people near Tiger Hill, a gambling house has recently been opened in the rural area of Tiger Hill, which may have been caused by uneven distribution of profits. However, no family members have come forward to investigate the matter, which is quite bizarre.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Security Team Arrests Bandit in Disguise</h3>
<p>The bandit in disguise, Cai Zhengxing (also known as Cai Maomao), is from Keding Township, Nantong. In the spring of the year before last, he and Zhang Shuishui and others formed a gang and burned, looted, and murdered in the various townships on the border of Tonghai, doing everything evil. Zhang Shuishui was arrested by the Nantong Security Team and sent to the county, where he was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment. Cai escaped and has not been caught. Now that the time of year between harvests is approaching, Cai has sneaked into the eastern township of this county, instigated the villagers, and secretly planned a riot. He was discovered and arrested by the Security Team the day before yesterday, and was sent to the county government yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Yixing County Magistrate Comes to Wuxi for Trial</h3>
<p>Zhong Jingcheng, the magistrate of Yixing County, was sued by Gu Tianmin and Gu Wang, relatives of the escaped Gu Tongsun brothers, the director of land tax in the county, to the Higher Court of Jiangsu Province for abuse of power to obstruct freedom and extort money through intimidation. After the Higher Court sent the entire case file to the local branch court in this county for investigation and handling, the Prosecutor's Office ordered both the plaintiff and the defendant to appear in court yesterday (30th) morning for interrogation. Zhong received the order and came to Wuxi the day before yesterday, staying at the Railway Hotel. According to County Magistrate Zhong, he came purely to respect the spirit of judicial independence. Officials are servants of the people, and the people, as masters, have legal procedures for litigating with their servants. He seemed quite emotional. At 10:00 AM yesterday, County Magistrate Zhong complied with the order and appeared in court. Prosecutor Shen questioned him in detail about the case in the reception room until 12:30 PM, when he was ordered to return. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Prosecutor Shen ordered the plaintiffs Gu Tianmin and Gu Wang to appear in court for questioning, after which they were ordered to return and await further handling.</p>
<h3>Dredging of Lujiang River Begins</h3>
<p>The county's Construction Bureau is undertaking the dredging of six major rivers as a work-relief project, which has already begun. The Lujiang River in the Fourth District is also one of the six major rivers, and Director Zhu is responsible for handling it. Two collapsed dams have been built at the mouth of the Lujiang River and Baishi Mountain, spanning three li. It has been decided that the villagers of Liukang Township, Xinglong Township, Lujiang Township, Hutai Town, and Zhangshe Town will provide labor, totaling more than 3,800 people, and each person is required to dredge one chi and eight cun wide and seven chi deep. It is expected to start today.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Collection of Donations for Yellow Croaker Fish</h3>
<p>In this county, local donations are being collected uniformly according to provincial orders. Chen Jingxin has been appointed as the director and has established a collection office. Currently, it is the season for yellow croaker fish. The county relief agency previously collected a fish industry subsidy fee of three copper coins per share. Additionally, the county education bureau annually receives 400,000 copper coins in fish share donations. Following established procedures, personnel are dispatched daily to various fish markets to verify records, count, and collect the funds. Yesterday, the county magistrate instructed the fish industry association to notify all businesses to comply and pay the fees accordingly.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Reclaiming Coastal Wasteland in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government estimates that there are 8 million mu of unreclaimed coastal wasteland in northern Jiangsu. Currently, water conservancy projects in northern Jiangsu are being implemented in stages. This wasteland should be reclaimed urgently. Therefore, Li Jixin, the director of the Reclamation Design Committee, along with committee members such as Wang Muhan, visited various areas under the jurisdiction of Tongzhou and Taizhou for inspection. Based on a comprehensive review of their reports, they have determined the steps to be taken.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Corruption in Land Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Provincial Committee member Ye Chunpeng discovered corruption in the collection of land taxes in Tongzhou. Dai Jinsheng, the clerk involved, has been detained by the county government. The records of the grain embezzlement have been thoroughly investigated, and the full details of the corruption are now clear. The case will be transferred to the court for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>One Copper Coin Leads to Bloodshed</h3>
<p>At the Shao Fuchang rice shop in Qinzao Town, on the evening of the 27th, a night watchman named Liang Yongsheng attempted to exchange one silver dollar. A dispute arose over one copper coin. Liang opened fire, killing the shop owner, Shao Run. Liang fled after the incident. Businesses have gone on strike in protest. The victim's family came to the city on the 28th to report the case to the court for an investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Building Puqi Road and Constructing Wanfu Bridge</h3>
<p>The Wanfu Bridge between Yangzhou and Xiannvzhen was destroyed by Sun Chuanfang's troops and has not been repaired since. Although Li Zhijing, a timber merchant from Wenzhou, came to Yangzhou and, together with local gentry such as Zhu Zhuxuan, formed a committee and planned to raise substantial funds to rebuild a concrete and steel bridge, construction has not started due to the large amount of funds required. The National Economic Commission, in accordance with instructions from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to build Puqi Road with a set completion deadline, discovered that the road's route through Jiangdu County must pass over this bridge and the Er Bridge. It has been decided to construct a concrete and steel bridge as originally planned, with the commission responsible for the construction, so that it can be completed simultaneously with the road surface. However, the earthwork for the roadbed should be collected by Jiangdu County. Yesterday (the 24th), the local county government received this explicit order. The general public is delighted that the Wanfu Bridge will be completed soon, making transportation between Yangzhou and Xiannvzhen more convenient.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Hu Jianzhong to Inspect in Japan</h3>
<p>The China Cooperative Society has sent Wang Shiying, Hu Jianzhong, and others to Japan to study cooperative enterprises. They are scheduled to depart on the Shanghai Maru on April 3rd. Hu is the president of the Southeast Daily News. During this trip to Japan, he will also conduct a related study of the local news industry. The study is expected to last about two months. Hu and the others are scheduled to leave Hangzhou for Shanghai tomorrow (the 1st) to await the ship.</p>
<h3>Hefei: Dredging the Fei River in Hefei</h3>
<p>The 54-li section of the Fei River from Hefei to Shikou has gradually become silted up in recent years, and it is only possible for small boats to pass through during the summer and autumn seasons, causing great inconvenience to merchants and travelers. In recent years, officials and merchants have repeatedly proposed dredging the river, but nothing has been done. The provincial government has now decided to implement dredging, and has already remitted 50,000 yuan in cash and 20,000 shi of rice. It is stipulated that two sheng of rice will be issued for each cubic foot of earthwork, using work as a form of relief. More than 3,000 workers have already been recruited and have begun work, starting from the east gate. The entire project is under the supervision of Fei Jihao, the director of the provincial water conservancy project office. Liu Shi'an, the director of the construction department, inspected the river project by car yesterday.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou: Director Tong Rectifies Prison Administration</h3>
<p>Since Tong Hangshi became the president of the Fujian Higher Court, he has devoted all his efforts to judicial administration, improving facilities. This time, in order to rectify prisons, he specifically proposed repairing prison buildings at the current provincial government administrative meeting. Approval has been granted to the county magistrates to make payments from their revenue. The resolution has been passed and sent to the provincial government for implementation. It is said that in order to supervise and investigate the actual conditions of the various counties, Director Tong plans to send Zhang Zuwang, the chief accountant of the court, and Hu Yifan, a clerk, to conduct on-site inspections of the various counties.</p>

<h3>Bank of China Held General Meeting of Shareholders Yesterday: Resolved that Official and Commercial Capital Be Shared Equally; Revised Regulations Promulgated by the Ministry Have Been Passed; Ministry of Finance Has Determined Candidates for Official Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, after the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan of the 1935 Financial Public Bonds to increase the official capital of the Bank of China, the Bank of China held its 18th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road at 1:00 PM yesterday. In addition to reporting the operating conditions, final accounts, and interest distribution for 1934, the meeting also re-elected four commercial shareholder supervisors, passed the revised regulations, and resolved that the total capital would be 40 million yuan, with official and commercial shares each accounting for half. The board of directors was authorized to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance. The board of directors is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM on the 1st. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Orders Increase in Official Shares</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instruction Hu Qian Zi No. 13 instructs the Bank of China to comply. In recent years, the global economic crisis has affected our country, causing prices to fall and all industries to decline. Last year, the increase in silver prices in the United States further led to a massive outflow of silver from the country, exacerbating the financial drought and making it difficult for the market to circulate funds, creating a precarious situation. Considering this, the Ministry has repeatedly instructed the bank to jointly release large sums of money with the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to regulate the market. Industrial and commercial groups have also requested relief, and the bank has provided as much collateralized lending as possible to meet emergency needs. However, the Ministry believes that the internal and external economic situation is deeply depressed, and stopgap measures are insufficient. There is no sign of recovery, and the future is uncertain. The current financial strength of the three banks may not be sufficient to maintain stability. The ratio of total assets and liabilities to total capital of the bank and the Bank of Communications, as compared to the general practices of banks in various countries, is particularly unbalanced. If long-term planning and timely capital replenishment are not undertaken to increase creditworthiness, the situation will become difficult to manage. The Bank of China's original capital was 25 million yuan, of which 5 million yuan was official shares. An additional 25 million yuan of official shares should be added, to be allocated from the 1935 Financial Public Bonds. The Ministry has already decided to implement this proposal. Now, 25 million yuan of the 1935 Financial Public Bonds and five subscription warrants are issued with this document. Please verify receipt, complete a receipt for the 25 million yuan of official shares, and submit it to the Ministry for filing. Since the official shares of the bank have been increased, the original regulations should be amended accordingly. The full text of the Ministry's revised regulations is enclosed. The bank is ordered to convene a board meeting immediately to make a resolution and submit it to the shareholders' meeting on the 30th of this month for handling and reporting. This is an important order. Enclosed are 25 million yuan of Financial Public Bonds, five subscription warrants, and a copy of the revised regulations of the Bank of China. March 28, 1935. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Chairman Announces Meeting to Proceed According to Regulations</p>
<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday, 504 shareholders, including Xu Jiyi, Lu Xuepu, and Gu Xinyi, attended the meeting with 114,605 shares, which was sufficient to meet the legal quorum. The meeting was started with a bell ringing. Chairman Li Fusun presided over the meeting and performed the formalities. First, the chairman reported that Article 56 of the Bank's Articles of Association states that the shareholders' meeting cannot be held unless at least one-seventh of the members and one-third of the capital are present. It was verified that the bank's shareholders had fully subscribed to 250,000 shares, and one-third of that is 83,334 shares. There are a total of 2,848 members, and one-seventh of that is 407 people. Today, the number of shares represented at the meeting is 114,605, and the number of attendees is 504, both of which exceed the legal quorum. The meeting should proceed according to the regulations.</p>
<p>Report on Last Year's Operating Conditions</p>
<p>The report on the operating conditions for 1934 is as follows: In the first half of the year, there was a surplus of funds. Although the bank reduced deposit interest rates, deposits continued to increase, and there was no reliable way to earn profits. In the second half of the year, the silver issue occurred, and credit suddenly tightened. The need for funds from all sides was difficult to meet. Therefore, the operating difficulties of 1934 were unprecedented. The bank has always adhered to its inherent policy: when funds are abundant and the market is loose, it is cautious and prudent, being aware of the inevitability of cycles, and is willing to bear losses. When the market is tight, it weighs the priorities, maintains its normal operations, and fulfills its due responsibilities. However, the bank's ability to do so cannot always correspond to the needs of the outside world, and there are different subjective views on the relative importance and urgency of various matters. This is why the financial community cannot be understood by the business community, and the bank's position cannot satisfy everyone. This is inevitable. Even the financial communities of Europe and America cannot avoid this. The survival and relief of the national economy depend on the thorough cooperation between the financial community, the business community, the government, and society. The recovery of the British economy during its depression is a precedent for this. We hope that the spirit of unity between the bank and society will be the guiding principle for future operations. As for the general business situation in 1934: (1) Deposits: The total balance of various deposits in 1934 was 546,693,902.59, an increase of 7,409,375.430 compared to 1933. A comparative analysis shows that: (A) The balance of current deposits was 182,856,037.19, a decrease of 6,913,053.49 compared to 1933; (B) The balance of time deposits was 251,884,332.58, an increase of 40,683,484.35 compared to 1933; (C) The balance of interbank deposits was 111,953,531.82, a decrease of 26,361,055.430 compared to 1933. (2) Loans: The total balance of various loans in 1934 was 411,952,175.01, an increase of 60,563,565.86 compared to 1933. A comparative analysis shows that: (A) The balance of current loans and overdrafts was 184,187,435.49, an increase of 58,342,858.95 compared to 1933; (B) The balance of time loans was 197,761,116.77, an increase of 8,622,426.19 compared to 1933; (C) The balance of discounts and purchased bills was 30,003,622.75, a decrease of 6,401,719.28 compared to 1933. During the loan season of this year, the bank had to increase the amount of loans appropriately to meet the needs of the tight market in various places, with an average increase of about 15% compared to 1933. In order to make funds more flexible and increase efficiency, it slightly favored current loans and overdrafts. Therefore, time loans increased by 4.5% compared to 1933, while current loans and overdrafts increased by 46.2% compared to 1933. In addition, the bank continued to vigorously promote the direct acceptance of local product bills from the interior in order to actually subsidize the transportation and sale of products. In mid-November, the highest outstanding balance of funds used for bills and pledge drafts reached 40.08 million yuan. (3) Remittances: The total amount of remittances received throughout the year in 1934 was 834,233,000 yuan, an increase of 79,512,000 yuan compared to 1933. (4) Foreign Exchange: The foreign exchange business in 1934 made significant progress compared to 1933. The total volume of foreign exchange business in 1933, converted into silver dollars, was 956,143,000 yuan. In 1934, it increased to 989,446,000 yuan, an increase of 33,303,000 yuan. The increase is even greater when calculated in US dollars. (5) Issuance of Convertible Banknotes: At the end of 1934, the total amount of convertible banknotes in circulation was 204,713,465.41, an increase of 20,986,468.04 compared to the total amount in circulation at the end of 1933. In terms of the reserve for convertible banknotes, the cash reserve was 129,660,826.89, accounting for 63% of the total amount in circulation. The guarantee reserve was 75,052,638.52 (61,617,268.49 in securities, 6,461,375.03 in property deeds, and the remainder being the guarantee reserve for bank and firm receipts), accounting for 37% of the total amount in circulation. (6) Securities: At the end of 1934, the total amount of the bank's securities was 86,981,599.06 (61,617,268.49 for the guarantee reserve and 25,364,330.57 for business operations) (accounting for 8.8% of the total assets, an increase of 5,134,553.15 compared to 81,847,045.91 in 1933). This is because the sharp increase in time deposits was intended to diversify the use of funds, hence the increase as described above. (7) Profit and Loss: (A) Various Expenses: The various expenses for 1934 were more than 6.666 million yuan, an increase of more than 612,000 yuan compared to 1933. The bank's various expenses, including operating expenses, were increased due to the increase in postal and telecommunications rates in 1934. The increase in the bank's business and the establishment of new agencies were also the main reasons for the increase in expenses. (B) Distribution of Net Profit: The net profit for 1934 was 1,933,317.01. After setting aside one-tenth, or 193,331.70, as a public reserve fund according to regulations, the remaining 1,739,985.31 was added to the balance carried forward from the previous year of 6,540.28, less the 1,729,854.00 paid for the 7% interest on official and commercial shares. The remaining 16,671.59 was still listed under the retained earnings carried forward. It was found that the bank had not collected 287,800 yuan of share capital, which was fully collected at the end of 1934. However, since the interest was calculated from January 1, 1935, the dividend for 1934 was still calculated based on the original collected share capital of 24,712,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Distribution of Interest to Official and Commercial Shareholders</p>
<p>The proposal for the distribution of interest for 1934: The total net profit was 1,933,317.01 yuan. (1) Setting aside a public reserve fund of 193,331.70 yuan, which is one-tenth of the total net profit according to regulations. The remaining net profit is 1,739,985.31 yuan. (2) Official share interest of 350,000 yuan, calculated at 7% on 5 million yuan according to regulations. (3) Commercial share interest of 1,379,854 yuan, calculated at 7% on 19,712,200 yuan according to regulations. The total official and commercial share interest is 1,729,854 yuan. Compared to the remaining net profit, there is still a remaining net profit of 10,131.31 yuan, which is included in the retained earnings carried forward.</p>
<p>Deciding on Capital Stock in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>After the various reports, the chairman read out the Ministry of Finance's instruction to increase official shares and the revised regulations. Then, the discussion began. The shareholders successively expressed their opinions. There were no objections to the regulations copied and distributed by the Ministry of Finance. The total capital stock was resolved to be 40 million yuan, with official and commercial shares each accounting for half. The board of directors was authorized to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Four Commercial Shareholder Supervisors Elected</p>
<p>After the discussion, the chairman reported that the terms of office for the ministry-appointed and commercial shareholder supervisors had now expired. It was now the time to convene the shareholders' meeting. He had requested the Ministry of Finance to reappoint the ministry-appointed supervisors, and he had received an order from the ministry to continue to appoint Li Jue. All four commercial shareholder supervisors should be re-elected according to regulations. As a result, Lu Xuepu received 4,263 votes, Zhang Wenhuan received 4,205 votes, Gu Dingzhen received 4,160 votes, and Xue Minlao received 4,049 votes. The previous supervisors were re-elected.

There is still one year left before their term expires. Therefore, the shareholders' meeting yesterday did not re-elect them. The Ministry of Finance has appointed Song Ziwen, Ye Zhuotang, Xi Demao, Qian Xinzhi, Hu Bijian, Song Ziliang, Du Yuesheng, Wu Daquan, and Wang Baolun as the nine official directors, and Li Jue, Zhao Jiyan, and Wang Yansong as the three supervisors.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Aviation Recruitment News</h3>

<h3>The China Alcohol Factory Opens Today Capital of 1.5 Million Yuan Factory Site in Bailianjing, Pudong</h3>
<p>The China Alcohol Factory will hold its opening ceremony at 3:00 PM on the 31st of this month. The factory is grand in scale and equipped with sophisticated machinery, making it the only modern alcohol manufacturing plant in our country. It is reported that Secretary-General Chu of the Executive Yuan, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Mayor Wu, and Director of Construction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government will all attend and deliver speeches. Minister Chen will perform the opening ceremony. The factory is located in Pudong. To facilitate the travel of guests, several small steamships have been prepared at the customs pier. The detailed information about the factory obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment Process Alcohol is an important raw material and solvent in industry, with a wide range of uses. In recent years, with the gradual development of industry in our country, the demand for alcohol has also increased with the times. However, in recent years, most of the alcohol has been imported from foreign countries, resulting in significant financial losses. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry had long listed it as one of the basic industries to be developed by the Ministry. It began planning the establishment of a factory while conducting research and experiments in preparation. Coincidentally, overseas Chinese Huang Jiangquan and others returned from overseas, seeking the rise of domestic national industry. They consulted with the Ministry of Industry to establish a large-scale, modern alcohol factory through a joint public-private venture. The factory's capital was originally set at one million yuan, but was later increased to 1.5 million yuan. One hundred and fifty mu of land was purchased in Bailianjing, Pudong, Shanghai, as the factory site. Construction of the factory buildings began in May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), and the installation of machinery was completed in mid-November. Trial runs began in December, and manufacturing commenced on December 15th. The quality is extremely pure, with a daily output of approximately 30,000 kilograms (approximately 7,000 gallons).</p>
<p>General Overview The factory base covers an area of 40 mu. The entire factory is constructed with reinforced concrete and steel beams, with a height of 90 feet. The exterior is extremely magnificent, and there are empty spaces inside for future expansion.</p>
<p>The chairman of the factory is Huang Jiangquan, the supervisor of Jianyuan Company. The directors include Huang Yuqi, Mei Zhezhi, and Liu Hongsheng. Mr. Huang is in charge of the factory's operations. Experienced personnel have been hired to oversee manufacturing and analysis, resulting in high work efficiency.</p>
<p>Equipment Overview The factory's machinery was ordered from England. The quality of the distillation equipment is unparalleled. The machinery can use grains, potatoes, and molasses as raw materials. The completeness of the equipment is rare even in Europe and America. The important parts of the equipment include the grain raw material processing room, the cooking and saccharification room, the germination room, the dilution room, the fermentation room, the distillation room, the chemical experiment room, and the canning room. In addition, the supply of steam, the generation of electricity, the storage of raw materials, the collection of finished products, the source of water, and the prevention of fire are all equipped with the latest facilities, deserving the title of the best in the country, worthy of being compared to Europe and America.</p>
<p>Expansion Plan The factory has a factory building for manufacturing carbon dioxide, in preparation for installing machinery to manufacture liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice in the future. The factory's future output will be approximately 20 tons per day, which can meet the national consumption of alcohol. Other factories, such as pure alcohol, refined alcohol, and automobile fuel factories, are also being actively planned.</p>
<p>It is said that China's current alcohol industry is still very young, and large-scale alcohol factories are even rarer. The establishment of this great alcohol factory and the products it produces can somewhat reduce the financial drain. It is of great benefit to the future of China's industry.</p>

<h3>The Seaport Quarantine Administration Held Its Fifth Annual Meeting Yesterday Evening at the Residence of Mr. Marris A Banquet with Over Two Hundred Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries</h3>
<p>The Seaport Quarantine Administration held its fifth annual meeting at the residence of Mr. Marris at 118 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession yesterday at 5:00 PM. Over two hundred Chinese and foreign dignitaries attended, making it a grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Guests</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Customs Superintendent Tang Hai'an, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Ming, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Cai Wuji, Director of the International Telegraph Office Wen Yuqing, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau Li Ting'an, Yan Fuqing of the National Medical College, General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the Ning Shao Company Yuan Lvdeng, Japanese Minister Arima, Consul-General in Shanghai Ishi, Rear Admiral Araki of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, British Consul-General in Shanghai Bailey, German Consul-General Krobath, and over two hundred male and female guests from Jardine Matheson, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Dalian Steamship Company, Lloyd Triestino, and other companies.</p>
<p>Banquet Situation</p>
<p>Guests began arriving one after another at 5:00 PM. Director Wu Lien-te of the Administration, along with Secretary Zhou Zhongqian, Chief Medical Officer Wu Changyao, Chen Yonghan, and others, personally greeted the guests. During the banquet, Mr. Wu delivered a speech, followed by thank-you speeches from guests such as Yamamoto (Mitsui). The host and guests enjoyed themselves until 7:00 PM, when they dispersed after taking a group photo.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Our administration has been established for five years now. We hold an annual meeting every year. This is the first time that female guests have joined us, and we extend a warm welcome. In previous annual meetings, we have always had Chinese-style banquets. This time, we have replaced it with cocktails. I would like to represent the Seaport Quarantine Administration and express our welcome to the heads of various organizations in Shanghai, as well as leaders from the shipping and commercial sectors. The preparation of this gathering was greatly assisted by two well-known figures in Shanghai's social circles: Mr. Harley Marris, whom we all know, and Mr. Epping Tuttle, the representative of the New York Times. Mr. Marris has been very generous, not only providing his residence but also personally taking on the responsibility of mixing the cocktails. In previous annual banquets, all the cocktails were also made by Mr. Marris. If you are satisfied with his excellent brewing today, I will find a way to recommend him as a cocktail consultant for our administration. Mr. Epping Tuttle has provided all the cups and plates to our administration. Therefore, the success of today's gathering is largely due to the efforts of these two gentlemen. In addition, I must also express my gratitude to the French Police for their assistance in traffic control. In previous annual banquets, there was always a report on the work of our administration. Those of you who have attended previous annual banquets must remember that after a hearty meal, someone would force-feed you a dull statistical report, sometimes with a forced attempt at humor. You would be surprised if I had the courage to do that to you today. Today, there are many female guests, as well as leaders from the financial and other sectors, and I have completely lost my courage. I originally intended to give a statistical report, but I thought it would be more appropriate to publish it in our administration's report in the future. Those of you who are concerned about these statistics can find them in our administration's forthcoming report. Now, I will briefly outline the main tasks of our administration in the past year. One of the most important parts of our work is the inspection of ships entering from overseas. In normal times, when there is no epidemic, this work is not stressful and no one pays attention to it. Only the relatives and friends of passengers who are there to greet them know that there is a delay of a few minutes for medical officers to inspect. We do this work without attracting attention, leading some travel guides in Shanghai to describe it as a mere formality. But one thing that is not known to the general public is that we do not adhere to outdated methods from various countries, as they only waste commercial time and cause inconvenience to passengers. However, at the same time, we do not fail in our international quarantine responsibilities and pay special attention to preventing the spread of epidemics. If there are any epidemics in neighboring ports, we will use the powers conferred upon us to implement quarantine restrictions at any time. In the past two years, that is, the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic (1933 and 1934), the number of Japanese ships entering the port has exceeded the number of British ships (the ratio was 678 to 528 in the 23rd year), but in terms of tonnage, the latter exceeded the former by about one million tons (4,545,276 to 3,571,484). American ships ranked third, with 255 ships and a total tonnage of 2,565,230. Last year, a total of 1,943 ships were inspected, with a total tonnage of 14,000,000 tons, from 17 countries. However, one thing that is most disappointing to us is that there is still no progress in our country's overseas shipping. Without the development of the shipping industry, our long-exhausted industry and commerce cannot be revitalized. I would like to express my gratitude again to the shipping industry for their sincere cooperation. All ship companies are aware of and abide by the rules of our administration. However, if they can find a way to report the arrival time of ships more accurately, our work will be more convenient and successful. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to give two examples to show that our work can sometimes be quite alarming. One day, a small sampan with seven Westerners on board capsized. At that time, a medical officer happened to be passing by on a quarantine launch and managed to rescue them. In another example, a medical officer was boarding a ship for inspection when the ship was suddenly hit by another ship and began to sink. The medical officer stayed on the ship until all the passengers and crew had left the ship before finding a way to jump back to his launch. It was also very dangerous. Other tasks, such as fumigation, vaccination, reporting of infectious diseases, and research on specialized issues, have been carried out according to the original plan in the past year, and have been quite successful. Last year, we fumigated a total of 654 ships, with a total hold tonnage of 1,600,000. The fumigants used included sulfur, carbon dioxide, and hydrocyanic acid, depending on the needs. Sixteen ships were exempted from fumigation after inspection and were found to have perfect rat-proofing equipment. An important event last year was the completion of the new quarantine hospital in Wusong. Our administration has long considered building a hospital in a suitable location to accommodate those suffering from infectious diseases on ships entering the port of Shanghai. It has taken four years of planning to date. In addition to first-class and third-class wards, the hospital also has a library, a museum, a chemical laboratory, and other facilities to facilitate specialized research, as well as a disinfection room dedicated to hydrocyanic acid fumigation. The hospital is built on the right bank, towering over the riverbank, and is visible to all incoming passengers. Regarding the study of rat eggs in various ports, we have paid great attention to it in the past four years. All the achievements have been published in papers. This specialized work is all the responsibility of Chief Medical Officer Wu Changyao. There have also been considerable achievements in the bacteriological research on cholera. Mr. Belles, a technician at our administration, has studied the water in various districts of Shanghai and has made considerable discoveries regarding the causes and trends of cholera in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Our branch offices, such as Xiamen, Wuhan, Tianjin, Tanggu, and Qinhuangdao, have received the sincere cooperation of local officials, merchants, and various organizations, and all work has progressed exceptionally smoothly. In addition to daily work, I and my colleagues in the administration are also working on compiling a professional book on common epidemics in Asia for the reference of those engaged in sanitation work. The first one, "An Overview of Cholera," was published last year and has received very good reviews from scientists and critics in various countries. The second one, "An Overview of Plague," is currently being written and is expected to be published by the end of this year. Last year, there was an important medical event in our country, namely the Ninth Far Eastern Tropical Medicine Conference, which was held in Nanjing in October. Participants included medical experts and health officials from various countries in the Far East, who gathered together to discuss issues related to improving people's health. All the discussion results are recorded in the conference report. This report was completed by me and Chief Medical Officer Wu Changyao in five months after the closing ceremony, and consists of two large volumes with over two thousand pages. The above brief work report has taken up a lot of your time, and I ask for your forgiveness. I have tried my best to avoid talking about specialized technical matters, as the purpose of today's gathering is to have fun. At the same time, I also hope that you will show interest in and understand our work, and give us encouragement so that we can improve the health of the country. Finally, I must express my deep gratitude to the Inspector General of Customs, the various Customs Superintendents, the Customs Commissioners, the local officials, the shipping companies, the crew members of the ships, and other caring people for their various assistance to us.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Announces Silver Import and Export Figures Imports of 3.25 Million in Two Months Gold Exports Doubled Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that the total national silver exports in February and March were only 1 million yuan in national currency, while imports were 3,259,407 yuan.

<h3>Sassoon Responds to Dissent Says His Sterling Bond Plan Has No Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>Reuters Shanghai, 30th – Following the publication of Sir Victor Sassoon's so-called sterling bond plan, there has been dissent in public opinion. Sir Victor Sassoon today issued a reply to Reuters, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>I welcome the dissent regarding the plan I have proposed, because it at least indicates that my plan has sparked discussion. However, I must strongly refute the suggestion that my plan has ulterior motives. My only wish in proposing this plan is to help resolve the existing monetary situation and alleviate the urgency of the Shanghai market. This plan, of course, is not impossible to apply equally to subsidiary currencies based on the Japanese yen, the US dollar, or the Swiss franc. However, I have suggested the pound sterling for the following reasons: First, the pound sterling is currently the most widely used currency in the world. Most countries that have not yet adopted gold as their monetary standard use it. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Estonia, the Baltic countries, and various parts of the British Empire all use monetary standards linked to the pound sterling. It is generally recognized that the countries belonging to the so-called Sterling Bloc are more prosperous than other countries. Second, I believe that China has a chance to obtain sterling loans. As for whether other types of loans can be obtained, I have not heard of any. On this point, it is essential to remember that if China prepares to bear the expenses of printing sterling bonds and implements the plan I have proposed, then in reality there is no need for a loan. Third, I know that private individuals can seek sterling credit here. If they seek large-scale credit in other currencies, I know it is not easy. To give an example, although I cannot borrow Shanghai silver dollars against free bonds, gold, or silver, I was able to borrow pounds sterling against the foundation of a property in the central district of the concession a few days ago. However, I cannot use this amount of pounds in the current situation in Shanghai. If under the plan I have proposed, I would be able to use it. Whether people approve of my plan or not, it can indeed provide an expansion of currency and credit without inflation. I have always believed that the severe obstacles faced by ordinary trade are due to the current lack of currency and credit in the seven seas. I admit that my plan is limited in scope and cannot provide the central government with more funds. I only see this plan as a kind of machine oil, to allow the axis of industry and commerce to operate and restore its normal speed. When I proposed this plan, I solemnly stated that regardless of whether this plan is beneficial or not, it will not cause any harm. As for the proposal to issue government bonds, I cannot see how it can increase the circulation of currency, unless these bonds can be sold to people who currently hoard currency, or unless banknotes are issued with government bonds without ordinary silver reserves as collateral. If this is the case, then it is pure and unadulterated inflation. It is reported that Mr. Song Ziwen does not approve of my plan, but as far as I know, I have not yet seen other suggestions that can avoid the tendency of currency inflation or be manipulated.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Waterworks Company Last Year's Surplus of Over Two Million Yuan New Tariff Regulations to be Implemented Next Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company held its annual shareholders' meeting at its head office on Jiangxi Road on Saturday (30th) at noon. According to the report of General Manager Li Deli, the total income from water charges last year was 5,335,351 yuan. After deducting expenses, the total profit was 3,117,522 yuan. After deducting miscellaneous losses, the net profit was 2,256,022 yuan. A shares will receive a dividend of 3 shillings and 9 pence per share, and B shares will receive a dividend of 2 shillings and 2.5 pence per share. As for water charges, due to the current unstable financial situation, it is not desirable to amend the regulations at this time. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been notified that the 20% discount will continue to be implemented until the end of this year, and the current tariff regulations will also end on that day, so that new tariff regulations can be formulated calmly within this year and implemented from January 1st next year.</p>
<h3>Record of Current Figures</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing by overnight train. He came to attend the funeral of Central Committee Member Shi Qingyang and will return to Beijing in two or three days.

He is scheduled to return to Shanghai before noon on April 1st.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Public Welfare Department Investigates the Situation of Fellow Provincial Associations from Huzhou in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Lake Society in Shanghai has been publishing advertisements in the Shen Bao, Xinwen, and Chen Bao since the 26th of this month, soliciting registration from fellow provincials. According to Yao Junyin Fu, Director of the Public Welfare Department of the Society, the Society is a group of fellow provincials from the six counties of Huzhou, aiming to promote the development of the six counties of Huzhou and the careers of fellow provincials living abroad. It strives to support fellow provincials in education, agriculture, industry, commerce, and public welfare, in order to promote development. It is not limited to the scope of passive relief, but also includes the construction of active production undertakings. Regarding public welfare, such as providing relief to disaster victims, funding fellow provincials to return to their hometowns, and providing summer medicine, the Society is now organizing a survey of the motives of fellow provincials. The reason is that the number of people from Huzhou living in Shanghai has always been numerous, but due to the divergence of occupations and the dispersal of residences, there is little contact. There is currently no accurate statistic on the number of fellow provincials living in Shanghai. Therefore, a campaign was launched to solicit registration from fellow provincials living in Shanghai, aiming to connect with fellow provincials and without any other intention, and no fees are charged. First, a survey of a portion of the Huzhou teachers and students in secondary and above schools in Shanghai has been completed. Now, a registration is being solicited from fellow provincials in other fields in order to be comprehensive. In addition to the members of the Society and fellow provincials whose addresses are known, who have already been sent survey forms, there are many others whose residences are unknown and cannot be delivered. Therefore, since the 26th of this month, a solicitation has been published in the Shen Bao, Xinwen, and Chen Bao to avoid leaving out anyone. The number of registrants has been quite enthusiastic in recent days, showing that fellow provincials in Huzhou are all expressing sympathy for the Society's initiative. The six counties of Huzhou are Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Anji, Xiaofeng, and Wukang. The Society's solicitation is also for fellow provincials living in Shanghai from the above six counties. This initiative is entirely for the purpose of facilitating contact, clarifying the number, address, and status of fellow provincials from the six counties of Huzhou living in Shanghai. It is planned to solicit registration once a year thereafter to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Children's Tuberculosis Sanatorium - Grand Opening Ceremony Yesterday - Mrs. American Consul-General Officiated at the Unveiling - Mr. Cunningham Earnestly Expressed Gratitude to the Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Mrs. Laut, wife of Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul-General in Shanghai, passed away in Hangzhou last year on April 4th due to the epidemic. Members of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, of which Mrs. Cunningham was an executive member, deeply mourned her passing as she had shown great effort in assisting the association's affairs. Consequently, they initiated the construction of the Jiangwan Children's Tuberculosis Sanatorium (i.e., the Mrs. Cunningham Memorial Hall) to leave a lasting memorial to Mrs. Cunningham. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, the grand opening ceremony of the sanatorium was held at the flower garden of the Cheng Ai Hospital in Jiangwan. Attendees included Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Luo Yunyan, Zhao Jinqing, Li Yan'an, Mrs. Jiang Kanghu, Ms. Ding Shujing, Ms. Xue Zengpei, Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul-General, Mr. and Mrs. Hermann, the American Assessor, Mr. Gale from the Inspectorate General of Customs, Mr. Berland, the General Manager of the American Iron &amp; Steel Company and his wife, Mr. Hickson, the General Manager of the Haining Foreign Firm, Dr. Le Xiongsheng, the Chief Editor of the Educational Review, Xu Peihuang, Zhu Shaoping, Zhan Gong, Tong Yuanting, Wang Zhongfu, Tu Zheyin, Zhuang Wenying, Mei Puliang, Cui Xizhang, Liu Wenlin, Zhang Zhilong, Xu Peishi, Cao Yimin, Xu Tongfu, Lu Wenting, Xiang Xi, Wu Huihui, Chen Tiesheng, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Yide, Zhang Yueru, Wang Guanyi, Chen Zhengfan, Gan Chao, Ding Bingnan, Chang Demin, Wang Zhenchang, Ms. Yao Shuwen, Ms. Gu Chunqian, Ms. Li Mingbao, and over 150 others. The ceremony was presided over by Dr. Yan Fuqing, the President of Cheng Ai Hospital, who delivered the opening remarks. Mr. Xu Jianping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, reported on the construction of the Mrs. Cunningham Memorial Hall, stating that Mrs. Laut Cunningham passed away last spring. Because she served as an executive member of the association, providing guidance and assistance without reservation, and loved children immensely, and because her life's conduct was worthy of emulation, the executive committee decided to build a memorial hall on a spacious and scenic plot of land in Ye Tuan, Jiangwan. They requested Dr. Yan Fuqing to allow the construction of the hall within the hospital grounds and to jointly operate a children's tuberculosis sanatorium in the hall with Cheng Ai Hospital, in order to fulfill Mrs. Cunningham's wishes of promoting child welfare. Dr. Yan, who greatly admired Mrs. Cunningham, readily agreed, and the proposal was successfully implemented. In June of last year, Dr. Yan meticulously drew up plans and signed a contract with a deadline for completion. The cost exceeded ten thousand, which the association could not afford alone. Therefore, they had to seek support to achieve the goal. They sent letters to both Chinese and foreign individuals who had close relationships with Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham, requesting their generous assistance. After the letters were sent, many parties made donations. The shortfall was temporarily covered by the association and Dr. Yan. The sanatorium has already been opened, and at the beginning, over fifty children have been admitted for treatment. The internal education issues have been agreed with Dr. Yan, with Cheng Ai Hospital responsible for treatment, while the association will hire instructors for education. Today, at the formal opening ceremony, Chinese and foreign guests have gathered to hear a brief report on the progress. He hoped for their guidance and advice. After Mr. Xu's report, Mr. Gale, the representative of Consul General Cunningham, delivered a reply, stating that Laut Cunningham devoted her life to the cause of women and children's relief. Building this hall to commemorate her is most appropriate. As the wife of the American diplomat in China, Mrs. Cunningham bore a heavy social burden, yet she found time to engage in women and children's relief. Her spirit of sacrifice is worthy of emulation by all women. In Chinese history, there are often images of great women. We believe that Mrs. Cunningham will certainly gain a prominent place in the world's biographies of distinguished women. President Kong of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, President Yan of Cheng Ai Hospital, and all friends who participated in the construction of this hall have enthusiastically contributed to creating a lasting memorial for Mrs. Cunningham. I, on behalf of Mrs. Cunningham's husband, Mr. Cunningham, earnestly express my gratitude to everyone. Following this, the unveiling ceremony was held. First, Wang Xiaolai led the reading of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and observed three minutes of silence. Then, Mrs. Hermann, the wife of the American Assessor, unveiled the plaque, gave a speech, unlocked the door, and removed the covering. Xu Jianping then read the memorial inscription of Mrs. Cunningham, which was followed by a group photograph, and the ceremony was declared complete. The inscription reads as follows: Mrs. Laut Cunningham, wife of Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul-General, was born in London, England, in 1886. She came to Shanghai in 1919, assisting her husband in governance for over a decade. Mrs. Cunningham was kind and courageous, tirelessly promoting and advocating for the work of this association. Sadly, she passed away in the spring of 1934 at the age of forty-eight. The members of this association, considering her life's deeds worthy of emulation, and with the consent of Dr. Yan Keqing, President of Cheng Ai Hospital, initiated the construction of this hall in Ye Garden, Jiangwan, to serve as a children's tuberculosis sanatorium, to record her virtues and to engrave the names of the supporting public on a copper tablet for eternal remembrance. Established in March of the 24th year of the Republic of China by the members of the Chinese Child Welfare Association.</p>

<h3>Campaign to Stop Spitting - Mobilization of Civil Groups - Expanded Publicity by Business, Industry, Academic Groups - Municipal Party Headquarters to Collect and Analyze Sputum</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Spitting Campaign initiated by the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association has concluded its Students' Day and Workers' Day activities since its start on the 28th. Yesterday, the third day, was Business Day, led by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with the total mobilization of all trade associations and citywide shops. Today, the final day of the campaign, is designated as Groups' Day, with the joint mobilization of all civil groups in the city to expand publicity. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Business Day: The Anti-Spitting Campaign initiated by the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association has already held publicity events for students and workers after its opening. Yesterday, the third day, was Business Day, led by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with the total mobilization of all trade associations and citywide shops. In addition to publishing a declaration of advocacy and posting large anti-spitting slogans in various shops, the Chamber of Commerce also sent representatives to deliver speeches and promote awareness, as well as to inspect affiliated associations and shops, urging them to pay attention to discouraging spitting.</p>
<p>Today's Groups' Day: Today (31st) is the final day of publicity for the Anti-Spitting Campaign, designated as Groups' Day. All civil groups in the city will jointly mobilize to carry out expanded publicity, aiming to achieve significant results. Various business, industrial, and academic groups will deliver speeches in various locations in the Chinese and foreign concessions. Beforehand, they have prepared a variety of eye-catching slogans, illustrations, and publications related to the Anti-Spitting Campaign for use. The educational film "Tuberculosis: A Self-Account" will be screened in rotation day and night to widely inform the public.</p>

<h3>Sixty-Year-Old Thief Sentenced - Seven Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Chen Fuqing, a sixty-year-old swindler from Nanjing, previously lured a prostitute named Zhong Yuan (also known as A Gui) at the Tianyunlou Amusement Park in the Wing On Company to the Unity Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. He secretly placed sleeping pills in her tea. After she drank it, she immediately lost consciousness. Chen then took her locked bracelet and gold ring and fled. After she woke up, she falsely claimed to have been robbed and reported it to the police station, which dispatched Chinese detective Zhang Yi to arrest Chen and send him to the First Special District Court for investigation. This has already been reported in this newspaper. However, according to the police investigation, there have been many cases of prostitutes being swindled out of their clothing recently, and the circumstances of the scams are generally similar to Zhong Yuan's case. For example, Zhao Zhou's second daughter lost a coat. A few days ago, she was summoned to the police station and asked to identify Chen. After looking at Chen carefully, the woman could not confirm whether he was the person. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye conducted another trial. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case. However, Chen pretended to be deaf and dumb, answering questions irrelevantly or simply acting foolishly. No matter how Judge Qian repeatedly questioned him, he remained cunning. If he were not an old and cunning fox, he would not be so experienced. Judge Qian believed that Chen was a repeat offender, and the case had been proven by the victim, so he should be severely punished. He immediately announced the verdict, sentencing Chen Fuqing to seven years imprisonment for administering drugs to render a person unable to resist and taking the property of others. The stolen goods will be returned after the verdict is confirmed.</p>
<h3>Murder Case in a Toilet on Xinmin Road - The Murderer Wu Changbin Was Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 27th of this month at around 7 PM, in a toilet on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, a person was suddenly attacked with an ax by a thug. The person immediately fell to the ground, lying unconscious in a pool of blood. Later, someone noticed and reported it to Director Zhan of the Menggu Road Police Station, who immediately dispatched police officers He Guangxin and Chen Mei to investigate and confirm the incident. They sent the victim, a peddler, to Pushan Hospital for treatment. The peddler had been cut in six places on his arm, back, and legs. Because the murderer had already fled, it was impossible to investigate and arrest him immediately. Until yesterday, the on-duty detective Cai Jilin went to Pushan Hospital to inquire and learned that the injured person, named Li Hengshan, 23 years old, from Jiangbei, was actually harmed by an enemy named Wu Changbin. After receiving the report, Detective Cai immediately cooperated with the original police officers Zhu Guangxin and Chen Mei and arrested Wu Changbin at the Tiger Stove at 797 Xinmin Road. After being brought to the station, Wu confessed that he was 28 years old and from Funing. He admitted to inviting the nicknamed "Little Paper Ingot Ash" and "Little Xizi" to chop Li Hengshan with an ax. The reason was that Li's mistress, Zhu Xiaoruyi, had previously been his mistress. At that time, he had money from selling tickets on the tram, but now his business has stopped, so Zhu Xiaoruyi was taken by Li Hengshan, etc. After the interrogator obtained the confession, Zhu Xiaoruyi, 19 years old, was also summoned to the case. Her confession was roughly the same as above. Director Zhan considered the case to be a murder case, so he ruled to send it to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Record of the Retrial of the Li Guojie Case - Li's Lawyer States That the Key to the Whole Case - Is Whether the Supervisor Has the Right to Receive Loans - Criminal and Civil Proceedings Concluded, Verdict to Be Announced on the 5th of Next Month</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, the former General Manager and Chairman of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was accused of embezzlement of 700,000 taels of silver in September of the year before last. In the first trial by the Shanghai District Court, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment for breach of trust. Li appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, and the result was changed to three and a half years imprisonment for embezzlement. Li still disagreed with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. Because Li was ill, he was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Considering the inconvenience of Li's sick body traveling back and forth, the High Court sent personnel to Shanghai to conduct the trial at the First Tribunal of the District Court, which was not concluded. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case was scheduled to be continued on the afternoon of the 30th. The Suzhou High Court delegated Criminal Tribunal President Hu Shan, along with two judges, Zhang Bingci and Zhang Zepu, Prosecutor Wan Fen, and two clerks, Shen Yuren and Zhu Minghe, to leave Suzhou for Shanghai in advance. Yesterday was the scheduled date. At 1:00 PM, Chen Xihui, the Deputy Judicial Police Chief of the District Court, along with officers Wang Jianqing and Xue Bingzhang, took a car to Shanghai Hospital to bring Li Guojie to the court. The Public Security Bureau also sent Yu Ruhai, the squad leader of the Detective Team of the Ximen Branch, detectives Zheng Yongxiang and Wu Xiufeng, squad leader of the Main Brigade, detectives Lu Zhenda and Zhao Jinhui, He Xixing, the Chief of the Ximen Branch, and Zhang Jianqi, the Chief of the Dongjiadu Police Station, and other armed police officers to escort him to provide care. When the clock struck two, Judge Hu and the other officials took their seats in the First Tribunal, accompanied by lawyer Wang Youling, the agent of the plaintiff in the civil proceedings, and Jiang Yiping, Lu Hongyi, and Lu Shifang, the three lawyers hired by the defendant. Listeners were required to sign in advance and obtain a listening pass issued by the High Court to be allowed to listen in the courtroom. The public paid close attention to this case, so the audience seats were full, mostly intellectuals, including several lawyers. Liu Enrong, the Criminal Tribunal President of the District Court, also sat behind the judges to listen. Chen Junfang, the Judicial Chief, and police officers Liu and Gu Hanqing, along with all the bailiffs, were responsible for maintaining order around the courtroom. The police officers sent by the Public Security Bureau were stationed at the gates of the court and on the stairs, and the detectives stood at the courtroom entrance, creating an extremely serious situation. The judge ordered Li Guojie to be brought to the case. Chen Xihui, the Deputy Police Chief, helped Li up to the courtroom. Li was wearing a dark woolen coat, looking weak and dispirited. After opening the register, he was allowed to sit and testify due to his illness. The judge said, "Now the Supreme Court has ordered a retrial. Please truthfully state the circumstances." Li then confessed everything, mainly that he obeyed the orders of his superior, so he handed over the 700,000 taels of silver check from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Huang Jusu, the representative of Supervisor Chen Fumu, to take it away. That night at 7:00 or 8:00 PM, he went to see Supervisor Chen but did not meet him. The next day, he met with Chen, who said that the money had been received, but the official business had not been completed. When it was completed, it would be sent over. Unexpectedly, an accident occurred. Next, the witness Zhu Shiyou testified, 30 years old, from Anhui, living in Lane Kanshou, Meiliyuan, West Road. There are 32 houses in the Meiliyuan housing area. He was asked, "How long have you been working as a gatekeeper?" He replied, "Four or five years." He was asked, "Which number did Chen Fumu live at?" He replied, "Chen lived at number 22." He was asked, "How long did Chen Fumu live there?" He replied, "He moved in around March or April of the 21st year and lived there for about a year before moving away. The rent was 100 taels per month." He was asked, "Do you recognize Chen Fumu?" He replied, "Yes, but I don't see him often." He was asked, "Do you recognize Wei Jinfeng?" He replied, "No." He was asked, "Do you know if Wei Jinfeng is Chen Fumu's wife?" He replied, "Although I saw and recognized Chen Fumu's wife, I don't know her name." He was asked, "Do you recognize Huang Jusu?" He replied, "No." He was asked, "Does Huang Jusu live elsewhere?" He replied, "I don't know." He was asked, "Did you see him (referring to Li Guojie) come?" He replied, "No." He was asked, "When Chen Fumu left, did his wife and children leave with him, or did they leave separately?" He replied, "Chen left first, and his family left later." After the judge obtained the confession, he ordered another witness, Yao Dekui, 26 years old, from Lanxi, who works as a gardener in Meiliyuan, to testify. The rest of his testimony was roughly the same as Zhu Shiyou's. At this point, Prosecutor Zhan Fen stood up and gave an explanation. The judge then announced that the debate would begin. The defendant's lawyers, Jiang Yiping, Lu Hongyi, and Lu Shifang, then stood up one after another to defend the defendant, stating that the issue that should be investigated in this case is only whether the defendant, while serving as the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, committed a criminal act by handing over the loan of 700,000 taels to Chen Fumu, the Supervisor of the company, to receive it. According to the Supreme Court's order for retrial, the key to solving this issue is whether the Supervisor's Office of the company had the right to receive this loan. According to Article 1 of the regulations of the Supervisor's Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it is clearly stipulated that the Ministry of Transportation established the Supervisor's Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reorganize the company and assign supervisory responsibilities. Article 3 further stipulates that all reorganization plans of the Supervisor's Office are the responsibility of the General Manager's Office to implement, and Article 2 of the regulations of the General Manager's Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stipulates that the General Manager is only responsible for implementing all reorganization plans of the Supervisor's Office, in order to clarify the authority of the Supervisor's Office and the General Manager. The authority to formulate contracts, reorganize capital, and other important matters all belong to the Supervisor's Office, as specified in Articles 5, 2, 3, and 10 of the regulations of the Supervisor's Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Article 11 of the regulations states that the Supervisor's Office handles accounting matters, which is sufficient to prove that the Supervisor's Office has the right to receive this loan. The defendant, in the capacity of General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, signed a loan contract with the American China Business Corporation, which was originally approved by Chen Fumu, the Supervisor of the company. His contact with the company regarding the 700,000 taels of advance was also under the direction of Chen Fumu. Moreover, the defendant acted honestly and should be declared innocent. The three lawyers finished speaking. The judge declared that the prosecution portion was concluded and the verdict would be announced at 11:00 AM on April 5th. The civil portion began. Lawyer Wang Youling, the agent of the civil proceedings, stated that the criminal portion would not change the issues and should be transferred to the civil court. The judge also declared that the civil portion was concluded and would be pronounced at the same time as the criminal portion. The clerk then read the record once. The judge ordered that Li Guojie be sent back to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and adjourned the court. It was already 5:00 PM.</p>

Yesterday, Mr. Sun Xiangzhong, the Secretary of the Peace Conference, visited Mr. Kriebel at the German Consulate General. According to their discussion, humans are naturally combative, which has been the case since ancient times. Currently, the great powers are striving to expand their military preparations, and it seems as if a major war is about to begin. However, it is still difficult to predict when the war will actually break out, so for the time being, peace can be maintained.

<h3>Xu's Fraudulent Acquisition of Wealth is Bizarre; Engineer's Embezzlement Scheme is Extremely Elaborate; A Single Check is Obtained for Cash Through Multiple Transfers</h3>
<p>The Fengsheng Industrial Company, located at No. 160 Avenue Edward VII, recently acquired a piece of land at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet in the French Concession and is currently constructing a building to be used as apartments. The electrical engineering for all the rooms in the building is contracted to Huitong Electrical Material Company, located at No. 486 Zhejiang Road. The company entrusted engineer Cao Guanlin (33 years old, residing at No. 728 Baker Road in the International Settlement) to design the layout. On February 16th of this year, Huitong Electrical Material Company received an order from the French-owned Water and Electricity Company to pay for the electrical wiring and meter installation fees in the building, totaling 2,261 yuan. The company immediately sent a letter instructing Cao Guanlin to take it to Fengsheng Industrial Company to collect the payment. Fengsheng Industrial Company then duly issued</p>
<p>a check</p>
<p>for the amount, and handed it to Cao to take to the French-owned Water and Electricity Company at No. 249 Rue Lafayett. After receiving the check, the Water and Electricity Company also issued a receipt to Cao. Unexpectedly, Cao Guanlin was recently heavily in debt and unable to support himself. After obtaining the receipt from the Water and Electricity Company, he had a sudden inspiration and a clever plan was born. He made several copies of the receipt and forged a letter from the Water and Electricity Company. On the 2nd of this month, he took the forged letter to Fengsheng Industrial Company, claiming that the French-owned Water and Electricity Company had now sent another letter, ordering the payment for the electrical stove wiring installation fees in the building</p>
<p>to be paid quickly.</p>
<p>Fengsheng Industrial Company then issued another check for 1,085 yuan from the China-Italian Bank on Jiujiang Road, specifying that it was to be collected by the French-owned Water and Electricity Company. Cao obtained this check, but because he could not cash it himself at the bank, he came up with another clever plan. He handed the check to the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, falsely claiming that two businesses at No. 156 Avenue Dubail and No. 16 Rue Cardinal Mercier were planning to install a large number of electric lights and other projects, and that he was paying the deposit first. The company believed him to be true and accepted the check, issuing a receipt. Cao then hid the real receipt and used the previously copied fake receipt, imitating</p>
<p>the Western signature</p>
<p>style to fill it out and hand it to Fengsheng Industrial Company as proof that the Water and Electricity Company had already received the electric stove wiring fees. Meanwhile, after several days, Cao took the previously hidden real receipt to the Water and Electricity Company, claiming that the lighting wiring installation fees previously paid for at No. 156 Avenue Dubail and No. 16 Rue Cardinal Mercier were being canceled because the customers had canceled the installation, and he wanted to recover the deposit he had previously paid. The Water and Electricity Company did not suspect him of fraud, took back the receipt, and immediately issued a cashier's check to Cao. Cao then cashed the check at the bank for 1,015 yuan (this amount was the money from the China-Italian Bank check paid by Fengsheng Industrial Company), pocketing it to</p>
<p>spend freely,</p>
<p>paying off debts, and living such a life. Until recently, Fengsheng Industrial Company sent someone to the building to inspect the progress of the project. They saw that the electric stove had not yet been installed in the building, but the payment had already been made. They were shocked and reported the information to Chen Zhongci (Ningbo native), the manager of Fengsheng Industrial Company. Chen then used this information to negotiate with the Water and Electricity Company. The Water and Electricity Company replied that the payment had not been received, so they had not sent anyone to install it. Afterwards, the Water and Electricity Company sent someone to investigate the electrical engineering in the building, and it was found that the project had not yet been completed. The installation of lights at No. 156 Avenue Dubail and No. 16 Rue Cardinal Mercier was also completely empty. Fengsheng Industrial Company also sent someone to investigate the Huitong Electrical Material Company. Both sides then understood Cao Guanlin's mysterious</p>
<p>inner secrets.</p>
<p>The truth was revealed. After learning of the previous report, the French-owned Water and Electricity Company reported it to the French Concession Police Station, requesting that the case be investigated and handled. The day before yesterday, detective Zhou Buguang and Chinese detective Geng Zhenglong, etc., together with detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, went to Cao's residence at No. 728 Baker Road and arrested Cao and brought him back to the French Concession Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated him. The police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stated the case, stating briefly that the defendant was arrested for forgery and fraud and that a detailed investigation of the case was still needed. He requested that the case be postponed for one week and that the defendant be temporarily detained to investigate the case before prosecuting it. Next, Chinese detective reported the process of arresting the defendant. The defendant Cao Guanlin admitted to the forgery and fraud without denying. The court ordered a postponement until April 8th, and the defendant was remanded in custody. A police chief who bears a significant responsibility, usually handles matters sharply and decisively, but today is bound by fetters, how inappropriate! When he was taken down by the court clerk, he was sad and unhappy, in contrast to his proud and domineering appearance during the previous court session. The shocking extrajudicial murder case has come to a preliminary end.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Forced Nasal Irrigation Case: Police Officers Sentenced to Ten Years for Murder; Zhou Pingyuan and Others Still Do Not Accept; Zhu Jianqiu's Wronged Soul is Slightly Comforted; Let Those Who Abuse Their Power Listen</h3>
<p>Due to a discrepancy in the number of people at the Family Food Cooperative, the household registration section of the Zhenru Police Station first detained Liu Fulang, an apprentice at the cooperative, overnight. The next day, Zhu Jianqiu, the owner of the cooperative, turned himself in to the police station to exchange Liu out. At the time, because Zhu's attitude was unyielding, he was subjected to torture by the police station, which poured a large amount of clean water into Zhu's nose, causing him to suffocate to death. This case has attracted extraordinary attention from society since it occurred. Lei Binzhang, the prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, ordered the defendants, such as Zhou Pingyuan, the head of the police station, Xing Guonong, a police officer, Zhang Zhizhong, the head of household registration, and police officers Liu Mingqi and Ma Xiantu, as well as witnesses, to appear in court for a clear hearing. After being identified by the Zhenru Forensic Institute, they were prosecuted in the criminal court. Judge Shao Qinzhi held three court sessions to hear the case. Xing Guonong and Zhou Pingyuan were separately taken into custody. Fang Ju of the Public Security Bureau, after learning of the previous situation, dismissed Zhou from his post but had to hand over the case files to the new incumbent. Therefore, he prepared a document to take responsibility and bailed Zhou Pingyuan out to rush to handle all the handover procedures. Therefore, at the previous court session, the Public Security Bureau sent eight armed police officers to escort Zhou Pingyuan to court to await instructions. After the trial, the police took him back to the Public Security Bureau for custody. It is now learned that the handover procedures have been completed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Judge Shao ascended to the third court to announce the verdict, ordering Xing Guonong, who was in custody, to be brought to the case. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent police to escort Zhou Pingyuan to the case. After the judge briefly inquired about their ages and origins, he announced the verdict in court: (Main text) Zhou Pingyuan and Xing Guonong are sentenced to ten years of imprisonment each for instigating injury resulting in death and must compensate the private plaintiff 2,000 yuan and 303.4 yuan for clothing, coffins, and funeral expenses. Zhang Zhizhong, Liu Mingqi, Ma Xiantu, etc., are innocent. After the verdict was announced, the judge said, "The Zhu Jianqiu case involving police abuse was handled by Xing Guonong, but Xing Guonong had reported to the police chief Zhou Pingyuan for instructions on how to handle it. When Zhu Jianqiu arrived at the police station, he was full of energy, which has been clearly testified to by various witnesses in court. The unanimous testimony proves that Zhu Jianqiu had no illness. When he left the police station, he was helped into the car by two police officers, which has also been proven by Hong Changzhi and other students from the Southeast Medical College. Furthermore, according to the forensic institute of the Ministry of Justice, Zhu Jianqiu had injuries on his back and died from being irrigated with water. For the sake of caution, this court has conducted several secret investigations. The facts are clear, and there is no way to escape the case. The court sentences you for your crimes. If you disagree, you can file an appeal according to the law within the appeal period." Zhou and Xing both expressed their disagreement. The judge then summoned the representative of the Public Security Bureau to the case and instructed, "Zhou Pingyuan has been outside for a long time. The handover procedures have been completed. He should now be taken into custody." After the instructions, the judge ordered the clerk to issue a reply to the representative. Zhou Pingyuan and Xing Guonong were separately taken into custody. The chief of police station, who bears an important responsibility, usually handles matters sharply and decisively, but today he is bound by fetters. How inappropriate! When he was taken down by the court usher, he was sad and unhappy, in contrast to his proud and domineering appearance during the previous trial. The shocking extrajudicial murder case has come to an initial conclusion.</p>

<h3>The Result of the Donghua vs. Western District Police Match Was Ticket Refunds; Wan Xianghua Caused Trouble; Weak Refereeing Caused a Huge Uproar; Spectators Rushed into the Field and Scuffled; the Office of the Athletic Association Was Smashed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Donghua and Western District Police played in the Western Union Football Group A match at Shenyuan. Due to the absence of Dai Linjing and Feng Yunyou, Donghua's lineup was weak, resulting in an evenly matched game with the Western District Police. Although the performance was not brilliant, the situation was very tense. The referee's ability did not seem to be high. Donghua repeatedly questioned the referee, and some unwise spectators added fuel to the fire, making the situation more turbulent. Finally, Wan Xianghua kicked and slapped the referee Beineng, and a group of spectators took advantage of the chaos and crossed the wire fence to enter the field. There were as many as five or six hundred people, surrounding and beating the referee and the Western District Police linesmen. The order was completely disrupted, and the situation was serious. This happened at 30 minutes into the second half. The many were no match for the few, and two spectators were beaten by the Western District Police.</p>
<p>Cause of the Trouble</p>
<p>The referee Beineng's ability was not high, and Donghua did not show understanding and repeatedly questioned him, followed by violence, which was a loss of the reputation of the championship team. The players' morality was also completely lost. Moreover, some unwise spectators always like to stir up trouble and make trouble out of nothing. Now that the Donghua players are like this, the matter became even more uncontrollable. During the game, the referee penalized Donghua several times for fouls, causing dissatisfaction. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. After the second half became 2-2, Donghua believed that Guan Xun'an did not touch the ball when he was penalized for a penalty kick. They negotiated with the referee, but the referee ignored them and ordered the penalty kick. Donghua was not prepared, and the ball was kicked in. Donghua lost 2-3, and the spectators made a big noise. When Li Yichen kicked off from the center, he sent a long ball that landed next to the referee. Wan Xianghua rushed forward and kicked the referee in the abdomen. The referee believed that he intentionally kicked someone and disqualified him. At that time, the surrounding spectators shouted and rushed into the field. Wan Xianghua slapped the referee again, and the spectators also joined in, and they fought into a group.</p>
<p>Two People Bled</p>
<p>Wan's kick and slap were the main cause of the trouble. This kind of behavior is not what a noble and famous player should have. The Western District Police linesmen were also surrounded and beaten. Some of the Western District Police players protected the referee and left the field, while others were surrounded and fought each other. The order was completely disrupted, and the game had to be stopped. Two spectators were beaten by the Western District Police players and bled. Yao Xiangsheng was injured in the head and face, and another person was injured in the nose and lips. They were washed and bandaged by the Sports Advancement Association. Afterwards, the spectators gathered and demanded ticket refunds from the Athletic Association. Later, the police from the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau arrived to suppress the situation, and the Athletic Association posted a notice to appease the crowd. They gradually dispersed around 7:00 pm.</p>
<p>Bricks and Stones Flew</p>
<p>When thousands of spectators began to destroy the fence and rush into the field, the referee Beineng, under the escort of three Western detectives, hurriedly left the side door of the Athletic Association and got into a car to escape. He didn't even have time to change his clothes. At the same time, another Western policeman shook the phone and reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. In no time, a large number of police officers arrived on Yanan Road to maintain order. However, the area inside Zhongyuan Gate belongs to the Sixth District, so they only guarded the road. At this time, thousands of spectators, under the influence of anger, surrounded the office of the Athletic Association and shouted non-stop. The situation was terrible. Then they began to throw bricks and stones, smashing all the glass windows of the Athletic Association. They shouted for ticket refunds, and the sound shook the sky.</p>
<p>The Police Were Powerless</p>
<p>Surrounded in the office of the Athletic Association were Shen Siliang, the secretary-general of the Athletic Association, and several other staff members. There were only seven or eight police officers from the Sixth District outside, and their strength was weak and useless. They could only let them do what they wanted, so they urgently reported to the Sixth District. Because the police force in the Sixth District was also small, they reported directly to the General Bureau at Dadongmen, requesting that a large police force be sent to support them. An hour later, the district chief of the Sixth District arrived with more than ten police officers, and the terrible situation outside the venue was slightly reduced. However, there was still no way to disperse the thousands of people who were shouting.</p>
<p>Result: Ticket Refunds</p>
<p>The district chief of the Sixth District did not want the situation to escalate, so he ordered the police officers to summon two so-called representatives of the crowd. After the two people gave detailed descriptions, they spoke eloquently. In fact, the representatives represented themselves, and the purpose of the spectators outside was only to take advantage of the chaos and demand ticket refunds. Finally, Shen Siliang saw that the situation was hopeless, so he resolutely agreed to refund the tickets. Then, the police officers led the spectators back into the field and issued a six-corner ticket one by one. More than 600 six-corner tickets were issued, and a group of riotous spectators finally withdrew. A storm was calmed down.</p>
<h3>No Matches at Shenyuan Today; Donghua vs. Innes Rescheduled</h3>
<p>After yesterday's dispute between Donghua and Western District Police at Shenyuan, there was supposed to be a match between Donghua and Innes at Shenyuan today. Because yesterday's matter has not been resolved, Shenyuan is closed today, and the match is canceled.</p>
<p>Dai and Feng Absent, Lineup Mediocre</p>
<p>Yesterday's football match between Donghua and Western District Police was less important for the championship. Donghua had already secured the championship, so the generals Dai Linjing and Feng Yunyou were temporarily absent. The battle was mediocre and not very exciting. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Team</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Li Ning Guan Xun'an</p>
<p>Gu Shang Ding Zhaocheng Feng Nianhua</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Chen Jiaqiu Li Yichen Zhang Jinghai Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Western District Police Team</p>
<p>Taisidao</p>
<p>Xiu Tu Mo Wei</p>
<p>Helei Gibbsen Mo Mai</p>
<p>Huogengsheng Baotai Weili Beida Wu Wei</p>
<p>Whistle Blows, Western District Police Show Their Strength</p>
<p>At three o'clock, the drums urged frequently, and with the sound of the whistle, the players on both sides showed their courage. At the beginning, our general Li Yichen had not yet arrived, and the absence of Dai Linjing and Feng Yunyou gave the Western District Police a good opportunity to take the lead. Huogengsheng and Baotai frequently sent autumn waves, making it difficult for the Donghua players to parry. Later, Guan and Li and other inner guards fought hard to resist, and Li Yichen arrived at the field to participate in the battle, and the overall situation was saved, and Donghua gradually gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>Each Side Scores a Goal</p>
<p>However, the Western District Police team was unwilling to be outdone. Within five minutes, the frontline generals showed their activity again. Huogengsheng seized a good opportunity to dribble straight in. Li Ning and others launched an attack on the border, and jointly defended the king, but it was still ineffective. Huo slammed the ball, but fortunately Lu Zhongen defended effectively and saved the ball. Later, Feng Nianhua was penalized for a penalty kick during the chaos of Donghua. Western District Police center Weili added fuel to the tip of his foot and struck with all his might, and the ball went into the net, opening the scoring with a score of 1-0. Since then, Donghua has been determined to wipe out the shame, and they have all risen up. Ding Zhaocheng looked around and sat in the center. Zhang Jinghai, Wan Xianghua, Chen Jiaqiu, etc. set off one after another and went straight to the enemy's camp. Li Yichen got a pass from Xiao Wan and rushed forward bravely. The iron cavalry started, and dust flew up. In an instant, he used a clever method to grab the ball into the net, creating a 1-1 draw. At this time, both sides had guards and defenders, and they were able to rescue properly, and there were no gains or losses. The first half still ended with a score of 1-1.</p>
<p>Western District Police Scores First in the Second Half</p>
<p>After the second half, both sides showed their power to determine the winner. On the Donghua side, the number of people was unfamiliar, and the connection was not good. The Western District Police was not as good as before and was not very outstanding. After a long battle, Ute Wei passed a ball to Huogengsheng and went diagonally. Lu Zhongen was unable to rescue, and had no choice but to let it go into the net. The Western District Police took the lead again with a score of 2-1. The Donghua generals were not polite, and Xiao Wan launched an attack forward, passing the ball to Li Yichen, who was assisted by Gu Shang, and Li scored a goal, making the score 2-2.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Causes Trouble</p>
<p>Since the score was tied at 2-2, both sides were closely concerned with the key to victory and did not give in to each other. Later, the ball entered the Donghua goal, and the Western District Police Ute Wei had the opportunity to kick a corner kick. Guan Xun'an defended very carefully. Seeing that the ball had reached the front of the goal, he jumped up, and the ball rolled down from Guan's head to his body. At that time, when the ball rolled down his chest and abdomen, Beineng pointed out that Guan committed a handball and awarded a penalty kick. At that time, the Donghua players expressed dissatisfaction because Guan did not commit a handball, and explained to him. Beineng did not listen and blew the whistle to start the kick. At that time, the Donghua generals were explaining to Beineng, and unexpectedly, Beineng ordered the kick, and they wanted to prepare, but it was too late, and the ball was kicked into the net by the Western District Police team player.</p>
<p>Xiao Wan Commits Violence and a Fight Breaks Out</p>
<p>After the penalty kick was scored by the Western District Police, Donghua was at a disadvantage with a score of 2-3. Donghua felt that this ball was unfairly penalized, and the captain and secretary protested to the referee on the spot to no avail. The referee ordered the kickoff from the center. Donghua's attitude was very bad. When the kickoff was from the center, Li Yichen sent a long ball that landed next to the referee. Wan Xianghua rushed up and kicked the referee in the abdomen. The referee believed that he intentionally kicked someone and immediately expelled Xiao Wan. At that time, the spectators added fuel to the fire, and the momentum was turbulent. Wan Xianghua did one thing and did it to the end, slapping the referee again. At that time, the spectators had already crossed the wire fence and entered the field, surrounding the referee, the Western District Police players, and the Western District Police linesmen and fighting each other. Some of the Western District Police players protected the referee Beineng and left the field, while others were surrounded and fought each other. As a result, two Chinese spectators were injured. The order was very chaotic, which has never happened in a football match dispute.</p>
<p>Demand for Ticket Refunds After the Incident</p>
<p>After the incident, the game was suspended, but the spectators demanded ticket refunds. Some 500 spectators did not leave until 7:00 pm. The China National Sports Association posted a notice in front of the door saying, "If there are any dissatisfaction with the referee's judgment in today's game, the association will raise it to the Shanghai Western Football Association for negotiation. I hope all spectators will be at ease and return." The spectators still did not disperse, so they sent two representatives to the Sports Advancement Association to demand ticket refunds and compensation for the injured. After Wang Dasui, the director of the Caojiadu Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, personally persuaded them, the crowd began to disperse.</p>
<h3>Youyou Likely to Win Second Place in Western Union Group A; Yesterday Beat French Chamber of Commerce 5-2; Last Match Today Against Western District Police</h3>
<p>The Youyou Football Team played against the French Chamber of Commerce in Group A at Shenyuan yesterday. Only hundreds of people went to watch, but the shouts were quite lively. As a result, Youyou beat the French Chamber of Commerce 5-2. Today is the last battle against the Western District Police. The Western District Police lost to Youyou 4-1 before. Today is the second meeting, and Youyou is expected to win. Therefore, the second place is like something in the bag. The situation of yesterday's game is described below:</p>
<p>Youyou Takes the Lead in the First Half</p>
<p>After the war curtain was opened, this attack and that defense, the game came to the enemy of engineering power, and the situation was very even. Sun Jinshun and Chen Shikai had several excellent scoring opportunities, but they missed by a hair. After about twenty minutes of stalemate, Xi Qiaosheng crossed from the corner, and the enemy's inner guards stumbled twice. Chen Shikai waited on the side, and kicked the ball into the net. Not long after, Xi Qiaosheng got the assistance of Zhong Yongsheng and went straight along the side, cleverly scoring the second goal. The French Chamber of Commerce was unwilling to be outdone and tried hard to counterattack. The forward Dahuate dribbled the ball forward, and Jiang Shanjing mistakenly committed a handball and was penalized for a penalty kick. Mashan'er ran up and kicked the ball, but unexpectedly the ball bounced back from the goalpost. After Youyou escaped the danger, the forward launched a fierce attack, but until the end of the first half, there was nothing to gain. Youyou took the lead with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Liu and Bi Succeed in Building Miracles</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, the French Chamber of Commerce's inner guard Mashan'er was transferred to center forward, and the military appearance was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the last move was often paid to the running water. After ten minutes, Zhong Yongsheng crossed from the border, and Xi Qiaosheng swung the door forcefully. The enemy goalkeeper still slipped out of the ball that he had in his grasp. Liu Zuru seized the opportunity and rushed up to push the ball, and the ball went into the net. At this point, the French Chamber of Commerce launched a strong counterattack. Mashan'er passed the ball to the left, and the left winger Monote crossed the ball, and Xiaohuate aimed and shot hard, and the ball went into the lower right corner. This goal was lost because Wang's goalkeeper ran out too early. After a while, Sun Jinshun scored a goal in the crowd, creating a ratio of 4-1.</p>
<p>Xiaohuate Blossoms on His Head</p>
<p>At this time, Xi Qiaosheng's wrist was injured and he temporarily left the field. The French Chamber of Commerce took the opportunity to attack. Youyou was a crippled army and let them attack. The left winger of the French Chamber of Commerce opened a corner kick, and the landing point was very good. Dahuate headed the ball, and Wang Shoudou jumped up and patted it out. Xiaohuate greeted the ball and headed it again, and it became irreversible.</p>
<p>Xi Qiaosheng Achieves Success Immediately</p>
<p>After five minutes of massage, Xi Qiaosheng's hand injury recovered, and he entered the field to help. The momentum of the attack was even stronger from here. In the last five minutes, Qiaosheng went single-handedly, and Youyou won with a score of 5-2. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou</p>
<p>Wang Caigao</p>
<p>Lu Zhiming Jiang Shanjing</p>
<p>Yun Feng Liang Shutang Li Shengguan</p>

<p>Mashan'er Up Qin Sheng Down Qiqingge</p>
<p>Binelli Baosai Te Mire</p>
<p>Monote Xiaohuate Mashan'er Down Dahuate Qin Sheng Up Fafanque</p>
<p>Today at 3:00 pm Youyou will play against the Western District Police in Group A at Hongkou Park. This is the last game for Youyou. Its lineup is as follows:</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Experiment with Draft Standards for Civilian School Curriculum</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th) The Ministry of Education ordered the various departments and bureaus, saying that according to the Chinese Social Education Society's proposed draft standards for public school curriculum, they requested adoption and implementation, etc. After checking, the draft is generally acceptable, but whether it is perfect and applicable in practice remains to be studied and experimented with in order to verify it. The original draft has been revised and printed separately, and they should designate five to ten of the better public schools under their jurisdiction to try it out for one year according to the standard draft, and fully study and experiment with it. After the expiration date, they should collect the opinions of the schools that have tried it out, and submit a detailed report for reference. The deadline should not exceed July 31, 1936. They should transfer the order to their subordinates for information.</p>
<h3>Bank of China 1934 Annual Business Report</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the disasters along the Yangtze River were gradually quelled, and the provinces of the Central Plains became increasingly stable. Even in remote areas, with the Northeast set aside for the moment, the Northwest did not experience any major incidents; bandits fleeing in Sichuan were nearing exhaustion; and the stalemate in Guangdong was gradually resolving. Furthermore, the central and local authorities were actively engaged in construction, such as increasing the construction of highways, implementing water conservancy projects, improving light industry, extending the Longhai Railway to Xi'an, and expediting the construction of the Yuehan and Nanyu lines. These types of projects progressed rapidly, making it not difficult for national economic construction to take shape, and a foundation for unification could be established. At the same time, various ports in Southeast Asia gradually recovered their prosperity, and remittances from overseas Chinese did not decrease. The political and economic progress during this year was clearly evident. What was regrettable was that floods and droughts spread across the twelve provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Suiyuan, affecting more than ten million people, with incalculable losses in harvests. This led to an increase in the import of foreign rice and increased the outflow of domestic silver. The difficult circumstances of our industry and commerce were already well known to both Chinese and foreigners; who would have thought that the United States would further raise silver prices, which was akin to kicking someone who was already falling into a well. How deep was the pain that could be endured? To break through the difficulties, self-sufficiency and independence were key. It is hoped that the people of the country will not harbor thoughts of shrinking back; the future is in our hands. Here, a summary of the economic, financial, and trade situations of the past year is provided for reference.</p>
<p>Silver Export Tax</p>
<p>In last year's report, the silver price problem was discussed, and it was anticipated that high silver prices could shake the foundation of our national economy. If foreign countries were to adopt artificial measures and enact laws to raise silver prices, this would further promote the export of raw silver. For the sake of China, it was sincerely hoped that all countries would continue to uphold the initial purpose of stabilizing silver prices as agreed upon during the London Economic Conference. Unexpectedly, within a few months, the agreement between the countries participating in the London Agreement had not yet been fully signed, and the U.S. Congress rashly passed the Silver Purchase Act; the U.S. government immediately engaged in purchasing raw silver on the open market. As a result, the price difference between silver in the Chinese market and raw silver prices abroad widened, and it became profitable to export, leading to a rush to ship silver abroad. The highest average monthly exchange rate difference between Shanghai and the parity calculated based on London silver prices was in November, at 3.9184 pence below parity; the lowest difference was in January, at 0.1789 pence above parity. From July to October, a total of 107 million yuan of silver was exported. At this time, to prevent panic among the people, the government decided on October 15 to levy an export tax and an equalization tax to prevent the continued export of raw silver. At that time, Chinese and foreign individuals had differing opinions on the government's imposition of silver taxes. Those in favor argued that if the U.S. silver purchase policy did not change, the price difference would widen, and China's silver reserves could easily be absorbed in an instant; the continued export was sufficient to cause panic and lead to financial turmoil. Those opposed argued that the Chinese people were accustomed to the existing silver currency: once the government reduced the silver content or interfered with its circulation, it would only cause people to hoard silver coins. Moreover, foreign people's willingness to invest in China depended on the free circulation of silver currency; if an export tax were levied, the value of Chinese currency would decrease, and foreign capital could not be attracted; and because foreigners had doubts about the Chinese currency system, existing capital would flee the country. Moreover, the higher the equalization tax, the more rampant smuggling would become. However, the facts proved that after the imposition of the silver tax, only slightly over 11 million yuan were exported in each of November and December, compared to the 79.4 million yuan in August, which was less than 20%. At the same time, because silver became scarcer in Shanghai and the exchange rate for silver increased, the equalization tax did not increase significantly, averaging 7.1% in November and 6.4% in December, and smuggling was not as severe as the opponents had predicted. Furthermore, the demand for silver in the interior in November and December was largely met by native goods; the trend of people burying silver was not triggered, which was not without benefit to financial stability.</p>
<p>However, if the United States were to implement its plan of maintaining a gold-to-silver ratio of 3:1 in its reserves and purchase 2.4 billion ounces of raw silver, it would not be enough even if all the silver reserves of China and India were absorbed. Judging from past experience, the outflow of raw silver from China would not only fail to increase the purchasing power of the Chinese people, but would actually reduce it. This year's import volume decreased by more than 310 million yuan compared to last year, which is clear evidence of this. If the U.S. silver purchase policy continues unchanged, it will cause the purchasing power of the Chinese people to drop to an extreme, which is completely contrary to the U.S. senators' advocacy of increasing the purchasing power of the Eastern people. Are they completely ignorant of the position of raw silver in China and the economic entity of China, and making such idealistic talk? Or are they knowingly saying this to deceive producers and implement the silver faction's central message? Or are they using this to raise the value of Chinese currency, reduce the competitiveness of Chinese industry and export trade, and increase the outlet for U.S. products, enticing the American people? The Chinese government has repeatedly stated to the U.S. government the harm of the U.S. silver purchase policy to the Chinese economy, and the U.S. government has fortunately understood and the implementation of silver purchases has gradually slowed down. It is hoped that the U.S. senators will agree with the two indelible arguments that raising commodity prices must precede raising silver prices to benefit silver-using countries, and that the long-term stability of silver prices cannot be achieved without the joint cooperation of the world's silver-using countries, and change their advocacy. Then, the national economy of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population, will not be on the verge of collapse due to the U.S. silver policy, but will flourish and benefit the future U.S. trade with East Asia, which cannot be compared to the small, temporary profit of raising silver prices today.</p>
<p>Sound Currency</p>
<p>What gives the people of the country the greatest sense of security is the government's declared policy of not adopting a cheap currency policy and absolutely maintaining a sound currency. After the implementation of the U.S. silver purchase policy, those with sensitive nerves suspected that the government would concentrate cash and implement inconvertible paper currency, or reduce the fineness of the currency, and rumors arose. After the government announced the Exchange Control Law in early September, foreign businesses were convinced that the government would take further action and began capital flight, exporting raw silver, totaling 107 million yuan from July to October. After the silver tax was levied, it was generally believed that the government's purpose was not only to prevent the outflow of silver, but also to pave the way for the implementation of cheap currency by reducing the value of paper currency. Perhaps the Chinese capitalist class also rushed to buy foreign currency and move capital abroad, making it even more difficult to clean up the mess. Fortunately, the responsible government officials jointly expressed that there would be no reduction in fineness, concentration of cash, or implementation of paper currency policies, and the people's hearts were greatly reassured. Not only was the escape of Chinese capital prevented, but the trend of people burying silver was also curbed. Recently, the government announced that newly imported raw silver could be re-exported tax-free, which further proves that the purpose of the government's tax increase was to prevent exports, not to devalue the currency. During this year, there were times when the financial turmoil seemed to be brewing a storm, but in the end, it was able to pass safely, which must be attributed to the government's efforts to maintain a sound currency. The Chinese people still live with the tradition of using silver for thousands of years, and have only recently gradually become accustomed to using paper money; and the people still view paper money as a representation of a certain amount of silver. If the currency value changes, they will no longer trust any currency; and then they will rush to hoard silver, and the foundation of credit will be shaken. The decrease in silver reserves this year is actually not a major problem today. From the first year of the Republic of China to the twenty-third year, silver imports totaled 1,394 million yuan, and exports totaled 408 million yuan, with a net import of silver totaling 986 million yuan. Although there is no precise survey of the silver accumulated in the country, it is estimated that there are 2.5 billion ounces, totaling 3.3 billion yuan. Based on the number of coins minted by the mints in various provinces since the late Qing Dynasty, there are 2,133 million yuan, minus the number of coins melted down by the mints in various provinces, which is about 267 million yuan, and assuming that 90% of the pre-Qing silver ingots (286 million yuan) have been melted down, there are 257 million yuan, then it can be known that the current amount in circulation is still 1.6 billion yuan. The export of this 200 million yuan of silver is only one-sixth of the total. If the government can consistently maintain a sound currency policy, then a portion of the 1.3 to 1.4 billion yuan of silver in the hands of the people can certainly be absorbed to make up for today's export shortfall. The government has established a sound issuance system and is gradually promoting sound bank notes to replace the traditional habit of using silver. The government's maintenance of a sound currency policy has already achieved great results; why not expand it to increase the amount of sound currency? This will not only solve the current difficulties, but also allow China to join the ranks of modern international economic organizations. The authorities should pay attention to this!</p>
<p>Sound and Centralized Economic Institutions</p>
<p>Since the global recession, countries have taken measures to save their currencies, such as prohibiting cash exports, reducing fineness, and concentrating cash; in exchange rates, they have implemented exchange controls, lowered exchange rates, and concentrated exchange rates; in trade, they have increased tariffs, set import and export ratios, and implemented barter trade. All of these are temporary remedies, but they have considerable effects depending on the specific circumstances of each country. Some knowledgeable people have questioned why these measures cannot be applied to China. At first glance, it seems that there are no insurmountable obstacles; but upon closer examination, there is a significant difference. China's economic organization is still the economic organization before modern nations; China's economic institutions are still the economic institutions before modern capitalism. In terms of currency, it is still a silver standard, with no unified currency system and no centralized issuance. Silver coins are scattered among the people, and there is no way to concentrate them; even reducing fineness cannot achieve the real benefit of currency inflation. In terms of exchange rates, foreign banks control the majority; Chinese banks control only a small portion; due to extraterritoriality and treaty port relations, there is no way to thoroughly manage exchange rates; before cash and exchange rates are centralized, there is no possibility of lowering exchange rates. In terms of trade, due to the actual diplomatic relations, tariffs have not yet achieved complete autonomy, so how can quantities be easily restricted? And the import and export industries do not have strong centralized organizations; even if they want to control them independently, it is impossible. Shortcuts are not unattainable, and emergency measures are not infeasible; but unfortunately, the institutions are not ready. There is a shortcut but no way to open it, and there is a good remedy but the body cannot accept it. If China wants to adopt modern capitalist economic policies today to resist the global trend and remedy the current difficulties, then establishing and promoting sound and centralized economic institutions is urgently needed. In currency, the rapid determination of a unified currency system and the implementation of centralized issuance are essential; in financial institutions, specialization and cooperation should be promoted, establishing a unified system to gather and disperse as a whole; in trade, trade organizations should be centralized and trade associations improved, implementing control through the people's own strength; cooperation should be promoted in improving and expanding agricultural production, as well as in transportation, sales, storage. There is also a need for joint centralization to reduce industrial costs and expand sales. Whether it is currency, finance, industry, or trade, all economic life institutions should be centralized and strengthened through political and social promotion, so that maintaining old habits and old norms and safely navigating difficulties is possible. It is also possible to apply new methods and shortcuts from foreign countries to resist the global trend. Otherwise, it would be like a body with incomplete limbs, ultimately unable to develop the effectiveness of the heart and blood vessels; or like a weak body that cannot be revitalized even with famous doctors and tonics. Therefore, establishing sound and centralized economic institutions is a fundamental task; at the same time, it is also an urgent remedy, as evidenced by the precedents of Russia and Italy, which should be promoted in a very short period of time and improved over many months and years. If the general public views this as a distant matter and prefers to pick up one or two novel terms to rally around, then not only will it be difficult to stabilize people's hearts, but it will also be easy to stray down the wrong path!</p>
<p>Shanghai Finance</p>
<p>Since the silver problem arose, Shanghai has felt the impact most deeply. The tightness of silver in other ports usually depends on Shanghai, so there is certainly an impact; but it is not as serious as in Shanghai. As for the interior, it is almost as if nothing has happened; some even find the disturbances in Shanghai incomprehensible. China's economic organization, generally speaking, is still in a nascent agricultural economic state. In the treaty ports, due to the influence of foreign powers, the level of economic development is worlds apart from that of non-treaty ports. And among the treaty ports, Shanghai, in particular, due to its geographical and historical relations, is almost the place where the economic forces of various countries are concentrated in China. All the tools of modern economic organization are readily available. Therefore, once a special event occurs, Shanghai feels the impact most quickly and sharply. Is it any wonder that the economic panic caused by the silver problem is uniquely serious in Shanghai? However, precisely because of Shanghai's special relationship, the panic in Shanghai cannot be used to generalize about the entirety of China; this is evidenced by the stability in various parts of the interior. Therefore, if we want to discuss how to remedy the economic difficulties in Shanghai caused by the silver problem, we must first consider what makes it special.</p>
<p>In recent years, the financial development of Shanghai has been very different from that of the interior due to excessive credit expansion. This is due to frequent banditry and disasters in the interior, the decline of local products, and the influx of foreign goods; it is also due to the low silver prices, where foreign businesses with silver funds temporarily store them in order to seek investment profits. As a result, the silver reserves of Chinese and foreign banks have increased, from 171 million yuan at the end of the seventeenth year to 547 million yuan at the end of the twenty-first year, an increase of 386 million yuan in five years. The result of the increase in cash is credit expansion; credit expansion must first expand the scope of investment. Initially, it expands businesses, either factories or companies, and because funds are easy to borrow, they can create huge businesses with small amounts of capital; then it raises land prices, because the increase in businesses leads to an increase in the need for real estate, and then it engages in real estate as a business: thus, funds are even easier to absorb, and the increase in land prices is unlimited. At the same time, due to financial relations, the government issued huge amounts of public bonds, totaling more than 100 million yuan in six or seven years; in addition, there were public bonds issued by various provinces and localities, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. Because industrial and commercial businesses require talent and technology and are difficult to promote, investing in real estate and public bonds does not require any effort; therefore, in the past credit expansion, 80 to 90% was in real estate and public bonds. This is a special circumstance in Shanghai that cannot be ignored. After the silver problem occurred in June of this year, the silver reserves of Chinese banks decreased by only 57 million yuan compared to the end of May and the end of December; while the silver reserves of foreign banks decreased by 203 million yuan; the decrease in Shanghai's funds was not in Chinese financial institutions but in foreign financial institutions; the contraction of credit was not in Chinese banks but in foreign banks. This is an obvious fact. As for public bonds, their credit support relies mostly on Chinese banks, unlike real estate turnover, which relies mostly on foreign businesses. Therefore, after the silver problem occurred, land prices plummeted; while public bonds still maintained high prices; this is related to the contraction of Chinese and foreign funds and credit. Moreover, the expansion of public bonds is a real expansion because there is an increase in fund income, unlike the increase in land prices, which is not due to an increase in population or business, and must be said to be a false expansion. Therefore, credit expansion and investment in real estate and public bonds are the same. However, the expansion of real estate and public bonds differs in terms of whether they are real or virtual.</p>
<p>The most obvious symptom of the economic panic in Shanghai is the illiquidity of real estate; and the reasons for this symptom, as we know, are excessive expansion and the contraction of foreign capital. Therefore, if we want to discuss how to remedy the situation, we must make this false expansion return to reality; that is, make the ratio of land prices to income commensurate with the current market interest rate. In other words, rents must be commensurate with the state of social life, so that there are no houses without tenants; or there are tenants who cannot afford to pay rent. Reasonable rents should be stipulated, and effective legal protection should be given to ensure that landlords can collect rent. In locations where there is no actual need, no more construction should be added due to real estate foreclosures or the inability to generate profits. After several years, it should not be difficult to restore a healthy state. During this transition period, mortgagees should reduce interest rates to ease the burden on landlords and help them cope. At the same time, foreign businesses in Shanghai should know that the prosperity of Shanghai is shared by Chinese and foreigners, and should not confuse the silver problem that affects the entire country with the local financial situation in Shanghai; and should not believe that the financial situation in Shanghai cannot be remedied simply because the national silver problem cannot be solved; just as we Chinese should not believe that the financial situation in the interior cannot be maintained simply because of the financial difficulties in Shanghai. Our Chinese banks deeply feel the weight of the responsibility of regulating finance; we also hope that foreign banks will work together to restore the old state and maintain the prosperity of Shanghai. As for other industrial and commercial industries, they will be increasingly constrained by the contraction of credit; but our financial community should still do its best to maintain those who increase production with funds, rather than flowing them out of the country; it is hoped that industrial and commercial industries will learn from the past and do their best to sort out the internal affairs and reduce costs; then who knows, today's disaster may be tomorrow's blessing?</p>
<p>Any country, once it experiences an economic panic, those who suffer difficulties often hope for currency inflation: but the phenomenon in Shanghai is caused by the past excessive expansion of credit, and today's sudden partial contraction; what is contracting is not only credit, but also the cash that is the foundation of credit. Therefore, if we want to solve the difficulties today, we must fill this partial contraction; and what needs to be filled is cash and credit based on cash. To increase cash or credit based on cash, there is no other way than to encourage escaping foreign capital to re-enter; or to absorb the cash hoarded in the interior as a reserve for issuance to increase currency. Apart from these two paths, if we want to increase credit not based on cash in order to achieve results, it is unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>The recent outflow of Chinese silver is due to the US silver purchase; and the long-term cause is still rooted in international expenses. China's international balance of payments is not easy to obtain the exact amount; however, the export of gold and silver is enough to prove the international income is not as good as the expenditure, which is the most obvious fact. The net export of gold and silver in the 22nd year was 83 million yuan, and the private export of gold was about 120 million yuan; this year, the export of gold and silver was 311 million yuan, and the private export of gold and silver was about 70 million yuan; totaling 200 million yuan in the 22nd year and 380 million yuan in the 23rd year; that is, the difference in the international balance of payments in the past two years has increased day by day. In fact, the recent increase in Shanghai's silver reserves is that exporters from all over China cannot offset each other, and have to offset them with silver dollars, which are temporarily stored by foreign businessmen in Shanghai for investment benefits, which is no different from preparing for export; therefore, the declared export of silver last year was 260 million yuan; and the deposit of foreign merchant banks in Shanghai decreased by 221 million yuan, and the deposit of foreign merchant banks in Tianjin decreased by 41 million yuan; the 262 million yuan is the price paid for imports from all over the country in the 23rd year and entered the hands of foreign merchant banks. Now that they see profit and seek capital security, they transport it to foreign countries in one fell swoop. It is clear that the long-term cause of the outflow of silver is still due to the consecutive years of trade deficit.</p>
<p>According to customs statistics: the trade deficit in the 21st year was 867 million yuan, the 22nd year was 733 million yuan, and this year was 494 million yuan; that is, the 22nd year decreased by 124 million yuan, and the 23rd year decreased by 239 million yuan. In terms of the trade deficit, it seems that there is a decrease year by year; however, in terms of the burden on the people, the trade deficit of 400 to 500 million today will be heavier than the 1 billion in the past. Moreover, in the future, foreign capital will not be easy to enter, and the number of exports will be difficult to increase suddenly; and the retention of silver is related to the economic lifeline of the whole country; therefore, the restriction of imports and the increase of exports need to be pursued urgently. In terms of imports: first, the three agricultural products of rice, cotton, and wheat should be restricted in consumption with the joint efforts of the government and society before they can be self-sufficient; on the other hand, tariffs should be gradually increased so that they decrease year by year; and the goal of self-sufficiency should be achieved in three or five years. This year, the import volume of the three items of rice, cotton, and wheat was 187 million yuan, accounting for almost half of the trade deficit. Second, all material construction must be carried out within our capabilities. In the next one or two years, we should choose what is necessary to do; and what is not urgent should be set aside for later. Third, import merchants should work with the government and society to find ways to control and reduce the purchase of foreign goods, and study the use of domestic goods as substitutes. As for exports: first, the export tax should be abolished immediately. The income from export duties was more than 13 million yuan last year and more than 14 million yuan this year; if the cost of export inspection is taken into account, the government will gain little. At a time when export competition is fierce and prices are low, if the government can abolish the export tax, it will be no different from indirect subsidies; it will also compensate for the weakness of China's high silver prices. Second, the inspection bureaus in various places need to be reformed so that the inspection will not increase the burden on the people, so as to avoid the people not getting the benefit of inspection but increasing the cost of export products. Third, research should be conducted at the place of production to improve the quality of export products, as well as the accuracy of the date of transportation and delivery. If the above points can be achieved in a short period of time, it is believed that the number of trade deficits will be significantly reduced; and the silver problem should have a hope of solution! It is said that at a time when the international balance of payments cannot be offset, if we want the currency not to contract and the financial crisis to be safely passed, we can only rely on foreign capital; either the government borrows foreign debt; or attracts private investment. Every country has this hope when it encounters currency difficulties. Now, in terms of Shanghai's financial problem: it is not only closely related to the interests of foreign businessmen; but also foreign banks have the historical responsibility to help each other. Therefore, attracting foreign capital should not be very difficult. However, judging from the examples of various countries, the supply of foreign capital is often limited in number and cannot achieve the effect of thorough relief; in the process of financial panic, foreigners are concerned about the instability of the currency, and attracting foreign capital is even more difficult than usual. Therefore, for the current plan for China, we must have the determination of self-reliance and self-rescue, so that foreign capital assistance can make up for a temporary period; otherwise, we can also overcome the difficulties with the strength of the people. Fortunately, the Chinese people are known for their hard work and frugality. If we can be united from top to bottom, frugal, who knows, we cannot have a day when the international balance of payments is offset?</p>
<p>The international balance of payments for the 23rd year, according to the survey conducted by the research office of our bank, is listed below: We only seek approximation and dare not consider it accurate; we sincerely hope that those who are interested in researching in all aspects will make up for its shortcomings so that this table will gradually become accurate!</p>
<p>International income</p>
<p>1. Value of exported goods 535,200,000 yuan</p>
<p>2. Underreporting of export prices (assumed at 15%) 80,300,000 yuan</p>
<p>3. Export of gold 111,500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Declared export 51,500,000 yuan</p>
<p>Smuggled export 60,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>4. Export of silver 279,900,000 yuan</p>
<p>Declared export 159,900,000 yuan</p>
<p>Smuggled export 20,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>5. Remittances from overseas Chinese 250,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>6. Foreign investment and credit in China 80,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Including US cotton and wheat loans, income from Chinese investment abroad, etc.)</p>
<p>7. Foreign spending in China 180,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Including travel expenses, church expenses, charitable donations, consular expenses, military expenses, foreign ships' expenses)</p>
<p>Total 1,516,900,000 yuan</p>
<p>International expenditure</p>
<p>1. Value of imported goods 1,029,700,000 yuan</p>
<p>2. Smuggled imports (assumed at 15%) 154,500,000 yuan</p>
<p>3. Repayment of foreign debt 112,600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Customs duty guarantee 75,400,000 yuan</p>
<p>US cotton and wheat loan 11,600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Salt tax guarantee 7,100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Railway loan 18,500,000 yuan</p>
<p>4. Overseas consular and study abroad expenses 6,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>5. Foreign business profits (including remittances and film rentals) 20,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>6. Number of sources that cannot be proven 194,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Including capital flight and losses of Chinese speculating in foreign stocks and goods, etc.)</p>
<p>Total 1,516,900,000 yuan</p>
<p>Among the above numbers, regarding the item of overseas Chinese remittances, according to reliable statistics from other parties, it is said that the actual amount in the 22nd year was 400 million yuan, which is more than half of our bank's estimate for that year; this is probably because it is counted according to the remittance location; and some of them have remittance relationships, and it is possible that one payment is counted multiple times. Or perhaps the item of "sources that cannot be proven" listed in our bank's report for the 22nd year, which amounted to more than 280 million yuan, includes a portion of it? According to our bank's investigation, the item of overseas Chinese remittances this year is around 250 million yuan. And the most difficult item to investigate on the expenditure side is the number of capital flight: therefore, it is temporarily listed under the item of "sources that cannot be proven"; but it can be asserted that the number is not small.</p>
<p>External Credit</p>
<p>The foundation for China's economic development in the future lies in the improvement of the rural economy: and opening up transportation and increasing the prices of products are also urgently needed. In the past, our country's transportation industry mostly focused on railways; and most of the construction funds were sought from abroad. Given the vast territory and large population of our country, there are still very few so-called trunk lines. Therefore, the need for foreign capital to complete the national railway industry is even more urgent than in the past. However, the accumulation of foreign capital depends on the financial situation of various countries on the one hand; and on the improvement of its own credit on the other. Fortunately, domestic politics has been stable in recent years; and the railway business is becoming more and more developed. Not only does it gradually have the ability to repay debts itself, but the completion of old roads such as Yuehan on a regular basis; and the start of construction of new roads such as Yuping, this can be said to be the beginning of the era of transition from stagnation to progress in the history of railways in our country. Now, if we push the reason for this, the fundamental reason is due to the stability of politics; and the railway authorities' painstaking efforts to maintain credit cannot be completely concealed. Take the railway bonds in the 23rd year as an example: Beining Road, Huhangyong Road, and Jiaoji Road can all repay the principal and interest according to the contract. Beining Road totaled £89,125; Huhangyong Road totaled £91,875, plus the deferred principal of £35,500; Jiaoji Road totaled interest of 2,400,000 yen; Jinghu Road only paid interest once in the 22nd year, and paid interest twice in this year according to the contract, totaling £139,200; Bianluo Road only paid interest once in the 22nd year, and paid interest twice in the unfulfilled year, totaling 1,762,500 francs; the original loan and additional loan of Jinpu Road both failed to pay the principal and interest in the 22nd year, and this year's original loan paid interest of £83,000, and the additional loan paid interest of £30,156. Compared with last year, the total amount of principal and interest repaid by railway bonds this year (including management fees) was £389,008, 2,400,000 yen, and 1,766,906 francs; the amount for the 22nd year was £350,891, 2,400,000 yen, and 588,968 francs. Calculated in national currency, the railway bonds for the 23rd year totaled 8,294,961 yuan; an increase of 540,336 yuan compared to the 7,754,625 yuan in the 22nd year. Viewing the above, the number is small; but this is also enough to show the increase in our country's ability to repay railway debts; and the high price of railway bonds in London is a reflection of the improvement of international credit. The London railway bond prices for December of the 22nd year and December of the 23rd year are compared as follows:</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the market prices of railway bonds in the 23rd year are all higher than those in the 22nd year; the market prices of Huhangyong and Beining Roads bonds have both reached par value, which is unprecedented. In addition, the foreign debts guaranteed by the customs and salt taxes managed by the Ministry of Finance, the principal and interest repaid for the British-German continued loan in the 23rd year totaled £823,126, the principal and interest of the post-disaster loan totaled £1,496,038, the principal and interest of the British-French loan totaled £318,363, plus the deferred principal payment once, totaling £250,000, the interest of the Hukwang loan was £141,450, and the principal and interest of the Crisp loan totaled £332,254, totaling £3,361,231, equivalent to 50,418,465 yuan in national currency. And the recent rise in bond prices in the past two years is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Looking at the market prices of foreign debts in London, it is not difficult to prove that although our country is in the midst of domestic and foreign economic panic, foreign investors have deep trust in foreign debt bonds; from this, we can clearly see that foreigners have unlimited hopes for China, which has not yet developed its resources; and it is not impossible to use foreign capital under favorable conditions that do not damage national sovereignty to revitalize industry.</p>
<p>International Trade in the 23rd Year</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the value of imports in the 23rd year was 1,029 million yuan, and exports were only worth 535 million yuan, totaling 1,564 million yuan; compared with the 22nd year, imports decreased by 316 million yuan, exports decreased by 76 million yuan, totaling a decrease of 392 million yuan. Taking the 15th year of the Republic of China as the standard, the decline index is as follows: (taking the 15th year as 100)</p>
<p>Year Import Export Total</p>
<p>15th year 100 100 100</p>
<p>20th year 127 105 118</p>
<p>21st year 93 57 78</p>
<p>22nd year 77 46 63</p>
<p>23rd year 59 40 51</p>
<p>Imports decreased from 117 in the 20th year to 59, and exports decreased from 105 to 40, both decreasing by more than one-half; compared with the 22nd year, imports decreased by 23%, exports decreased by 13%, and the total of imports and exports decreased by 20%. The trade deficit has decreased from 733 million yuan in the 20th year to 494 million; this decrease of 239 million yuan is partly due to the shrinking of the national purchasing power, and on the other hand, domestic industry has gradually developed, and the Chinese people have gradually known how to use domestic goods, which is quite optimistic. The percentage of trade deficit to total import and export trade in our country over the years is as follows:</p>
<p>15th year 13.07%</p>
<p>20th year 22.36%</p>
<p>21st year 36.09%</p>
<p>22nd year 37.51%</p>
<p>23rd year 31.59%</p>
<p>But further, the import index for the 23rd year is; exports are only 40; the degree of export decline is greater than imports compared to the 15th year, and the main reasons are:</p>
<p>1. Since the United States implemented the silver purchase policy, silver prices have risen sharply, and silver exports have not been less than 280 million, and the domestic finances have been in panic; industrial and commercial circles feel very difficult; high silver prices have made foreign exports difficult.</p>
<p>2. Northeast specialties such as soybeans, soybean cakes, and soybean oil, etc., have an annual output of 200 to 300 million yuan, which has always been part of offsetting our country's trade deficit. At present, this huge export is no longer ours, as repeatedly mentioned in the previous year's report;</p>
<h3>Agriculture Economy in the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>Crop Harvest and Prices</p>
<p>The crop harvest in the 23rd year was significantly worse than in the previous year. Taking the two most important items, grain and cotton, and assuming that the planted area in the 23rd year was the same, grain harvest was only 82% of the previous year and cotton harvest was only 73% of the previous year. However, the cotton area increased by more than 10% this year compared to last year, so the quantity of cotton harvested was even less than 73%. Therefore, the suffering of farmers last year, where large owner-farmers and landlords were affected by the drop in agricultural product prices, leading to income not covering expenses, and small owner-farmers who produced for their own consumption could still feed and clothe themselves, was not the case this year. Because of the poor harvest, small farmers could hardly provide for themselves, so the suffering was more widespread. Speaking of the harvest situation in different regions separately: the grain harvest in the Northwest and North this year was 4% to 5% worse than last year; cotton harvest in the Northwest was only 58% of last year due to excessive drought in the summer and excessive flooding in the autumn; the North was the same as last year. In the central provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, there was a drought this year that had not been seen in 60 years, and the harvest of grain and cotton was only half of last year. These three provinces used to export rice, but this year they imported rice from other provinces. In the eastern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, there was also a poor harvest, with grain at 76% of the previous year and cotton at 60%. Cotton is not a major product in the Southwest and Southeast; the grain harvest was similar to last year. Overall: the crop harvest this year was the most abundant in South China and the Southwest, similar to last year; slightly worse in North China and the Northwest; and the worst in Central China, less than 60% of last year. According to the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute: comparing the yield per mu this year with last year, the grain harvest in the five provinces of Northwest, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi was 5% less than last year; cotton was 42% less. The grain harvest in the four provinces of North China, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, was 6% less than last year; cotton did not decrease. The grain harvest in the three provinces of Central China, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, was 50% less than last year; cotton was 47% less. The grain harvest in the three provinces of East China, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, was 34% less than last year; cotton was 41% less. The grain harvest in the three provinces of Southwest China, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, was 2% less than last year. The grain harvest in the two provinces of Southeast China, Fujian and Guangdong, was 18% less than last year.</p>
<p>Agricultural product prices, based on the Shanghai market price as a standard, fluctuated. The biggest increase was in rice. The biggest drop was in silk. The rise in rice prices was due to the poor harvest. The average price of Jiangsu rice rose by 49%; Hunan rice rose by 39%. The quality of Hunan rice is closer to that of foreign rice, and the price of Rangoon rice this year did not rise much, while Saigon rice actually fell; as a result, it was imported steadily. Hunan rice was affected by this; so the price increase was relatively small. The price of wheat rose by 9% compared to last year; mainly due to the poor wheat harvest in China. As for the price of cotton, the price of standard cotton, which represents Chinese cotton, in the second half of this year was not much different from last year; while the price of Lingbao cotton, which competes with American cotton, was 11% higher than last year; this was because the United States reduced cotton production, there was inflation, and the price of American cotton rose; so the price of Zhenbao cotton also rose accordingly. The price of silk fell due to sluggish overseas sales, such as the price of Chinese silk in New York, which fell by 26%; in Lyon, it fell by 37%; so the price of silk in Shanghai fell by an average of 37%. Tea also fell by 12%.</p>
<p>Import of Rice, Cotton, and Wheat</p>
<p>The import of agricultural products in the 23rd year reached more than 334 million yuan; of which rice accounted for more than 65.6 million yuan; cotton accounted for 90 million yuan; and wheat accounted for more than 31.8 million yuan; totaling more than 187 million yuan, accounting for about 60%. If these three could be self-sufficient, then China's trade deficit could be reduced by half. The number of rice imports:</p>
<p>Quantity (metric tons) Amount (national currency)</p>
<p>21st year 13,599,692 185,764,906</p>
<p>22nd year 12,953,998 150,819,109</p>
<p>23rd year 7,710,610 65,684,678</p>
<p>In terms of quantity: the 22nd year decreased by 4.75%; the 23rd year decreased by 40.48%; the collection of rice import tax is an important reason for the decrease in imports. The breakdown of rice imports is mainly in Fujian and Guangdong provinces: Guangdong province imported 5.03 million dan; Fujian imported 1.07 million dan; Shanghai imported 600,000 dan; Ningbo imported 520,000 dan; Tianjin accounted for 350,000 dan. According to Nanjing University statistics: Jiangsu produces 43.5 million dan of rice; Zhejiang produces 43.54 million dan. If these two could pay a little attention to farmland water conservancy, then the 1.1 million dan in Shanghai and Ningbo could easily be self-sufficient. Fujian and Guangdong provinces have a larger shortage; but if the three provinces of Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi are not in a year of poor harvest, and transportation is convenient, freight is reduced, and miscellaneous taxes are exempted, it may not be possible to supply most of it. But at the same time, the concentration of rice in convenient locations and the improvement of storage methods should all be improved. The number of cotton imports:</p>
<p>Quantity (metric tons) Amount (national currency yuan)</p>
<p>21st year 2,245,498 186,782,997</p>
<p>22nd year 1,206,067 98,26,071</p>
<p>23rd year 1,163,223 90,246,598</p>
<p>This year's import volume is almost half less than the previous year. If the government's loan of American cotton is not included, the reduction should be even greater. Recently, the cotton planting area in various places has gradually increased; the promotion of American bolls has gradually shown results; if all cotton planting provinces can actively carry out the work like Shandong and Shaanxi provinces, who knows that self-sufficiency cannot be achieved in four or five years? And China's velvet cotton has an export of 30 to 40 million yuan, if it can catch up quickly, why can't the trade deficit be turned into a trade surplus? The number of wheat imports:</p>
<p>Quantity (metric tons) Amount (national currency yuan)</p>
<p>21st year 9,123,088 80,643,001</p>
<p>22nd year 10,714,634 88,043,295</p>
<p>23rd year 4,649,149 31,869,171</p>
<p>The import quantity in the 23rd year was reduced by more than half, the reason being the levy of import tax, similar to rice. The place with the greatest need is Shanghai, accounting for 4.08 million dan; followed by Nanjing, accounting for 320,000 dan, Tianjin 90,000 dan; again Qingdao and Zhenjiang, both about 77,000 dan. According to the large decrease in quantity this year, it can be seen that the quantity of wheat produced in China may not be impossible to be self-sufficient; it is only because transportation is inconvenient and the quality is low; therefore, the price and quality cannot compete with foreign wheat, and manufacturers are happy to use foreign wheat to make first-class flour, so they have to use foreign wheat; in fact, it is not a necessary import.</p>
<p>According to the above situation: rice, cotton, and wheat are all non-essential imports and have the possibility of rapid self-sufficiency; but there are always huge imports every year, which is due to the neglect of the government and the people. Now that the silver problem is becoming increasingly urgent, the self-sufficiency of rice, cotton, and wheat will be of no small benefit to the balance of international payments!</p>
<p>Agricultural Construction</p>
<p>We believe that the reason for the decline of rural areas is that farmers' operating costs are high and the prices they receive are low. The way to remedy this is to reduce operating costs on the one hand and increase agricultural product prices on the other. Over the past year, various parties have made considerable efforts to carry out this work; the more notable achievements are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  Water conservancy construction: Agricultural water conservancy for preventing water and drought disasters has a great impact on reducing agricultural costs and increasing agricultural production. In the past year, under the management of the Economic Committee, the banks of major rivers such as the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Han River, Huai River, and Gan River have either been repaired or culverts have been built; in the future, they will have great effects on preventing water disasters.</p>
<p>There has also been significant progress in drought prevention water conservancy in the northwest provinces, such as the Jinghui Canal, Luo Canal, and Liu Canal in Shaanxi; the Minsheng Canal in Suiyuan; the Yunting Canal in Ningxia; and the Honggucheng Canal and Dajiachuan Canal in Gansu, which have either been surveyed or built. Jiangsu has the opening of the Haihe River into the sea and the new Grand Canal. After these projects are completed, the harvest of agricultural products can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>2.  Circulation of agricultural finance: The lack of funds in rural areas has been a widespread phenomenon in recent years; the oppression of high interest rates is also the reason for the high cost of agriculture. In the past year, the government and financial institutions have provided loans to farmers at low interest rates, estimated at 100 million yuan, an increase of about double compared to the 22nd year. This loan not only directly reduces the cost of agriculture, but also indirectly affects the improvement of the rural economy and the lives of farmers. Taking the rural areas where the bank directly lends as an example: after one year of lending, there have been the following effects: (1) The equipment of fertilizers, livestock, seeds, and agricultural tools is more complete; the yield per mu has therefore increased. (2) Improved seeds of wheat, cotton, and livestock can be used; agricultural products are therefore improved. (3) Cooperatives use the surplus from borrowing and lending to run public schools and cooperative lectures; the education of farmers is therefore improved. These are all direct effects of rural lending. Other indirect effects, such as the prosperity of towns and cities, the stability of agricultural product prices, the rise in land prices, the progress of farmer organizations, and the upward mentality of farmers, are all worthy of mention.</p>
<p>3.  Rapid progress of farmers' economic organizations: The organization of rural cooperation is not only for borrowing money; however, when there is money to borrow, farmers are easy to organize. According to the latest statistics released by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute: there were 5,335 cooperatives established before the 23rd year, and 9,314 cooperatives established in the 23rd year, an increase of almost double in one year. At the end of the 23rd year, there were a total of 14,649 cooperatives. The number of cooperative members was more than 185,000 before the 23rd year, and more than 373,000 were added in the 23rd year, an increase of more than double in one year. As of the end of the 23rd year, there were a total of more than 558,000 members. Whether these farmers understand the true meaning of cooperation? Can they handle the affairs of the community properly? Let’s not talk about it for the time being; but the rural areas with this organization have more opportunities to improve their lives and improve their economy than before; if given time and training, the habit of group action of the members can be easily developed; their production and buying and selling power will also increase accordingly.</p>
<p>4.  In addition, the government's efforts to improve agricultural affairs, control agricultural products, and train talents have gradually moved from publicity to planned implementation. Academic institutions are also gradually able to use their research and experimentation experience to extend to national experiments on issues such as agricultural product improvement, disaster prevention, farmer education, and farmer organization. Although the value of the results of all these things cannot be estimated for a while; it can be asserted that their future effects will be great.</p>
<p>However, there are several points that should be paid attention to in agricultural construction: (1) Rural security: In areas with poor security, not only can the surplus capital in cities not fully assist agricultural production; even farmers who are tied to the land find it difficult to cultivate with peace of mind, which is the biggest obstacle to rural construction. Therefore, improving the organization of long-term civil defense is the first condition for agricultural construction; (2) Rural talents: Rural construction undertakings, whether in terms of technology or organization, cannot be carried out without suitable talents who have strong will, specialized knowledge, and can share the hardships of farmers. The people who graduate from ordinary schools in China are not entirely suitable. In the future, creating talents suitable for the needs of rural China is the second condition for agricultural construction; (3) Local finance: The capital for agricultural construction can be provided by financial institutions or private funds; but the funds for carrying out construction must be raised locally. We do not expect the government to reduce some taxes, which would prevent the general administration of local areas from proceeding agilely; but the existing taxes, taken from the people, must be used directly for the people; this is the third condition for agricultural construction.</p>
<p>With stable security, specialized talents, and sufficient funds, urban idle funds can easily flow into rural areas; the success of agricultural construction can be expected and waited for. This depends on the joint efforts of local authorities and the public!</p>
<p>Industry in the 23rd Year</p>
<p>The transformation of domestic industry in the 23rd year became even more acute. At the beginning of their establishment, all industries were in trading ports: because large cities had convenient labor supply, active financial turnover, low power prices, and relatively stable security. But recently, the security in the interior has improved, transportation has also gradually improved, and there are fewer labor disputes; in addition, the interior is closer to raw materials and consumer markets, forming a trend of inward development; this has been seen in the past year. As for the overall industry, in terms of region: port factories mostly feel difficult; inland factories are more affluent. In terms of scale: large industries lose more and make less profit; small industries can still support themselves. In terms of management: those with careful planning and economical expenditure all make profits; those with lax management and large budgets inevitably suffer losses. Although each industry has its own reasons for its rise and fall; the above are the common reasons. The main industries are described below:</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Industry: In the 23rd year, Chinese factories increased by 105.34 spindles; thread spindles increased by 7.18; and looms increased by 1.845. Japanese factories increased by 12.738 spindles; thread spindles by 21.992; and looms increased by 1.425. British factories increased by 1.712 spindles; and thread spindles increased by 2.720. In total, 151.683 spindles were added. Compared with the 22nd and 23rd years, the increase rate of spindles was greater in Chinese factories; yarn spindles were more in foreign factories; because foreign factories increased the spinning of fine yarn thread; and Chinese factories still mainly produced coarse yarn. This year, more than 150,000 spindles were added; but the total output of yarn was 2.272.834 bales, a decrease of 59.850 bales compared to last year; of which Chinese factories decreased by more than 45,000 bales, and foreign factories decreased by very little. As for the output of cotton cloth, it was 23.465.437 pieces, an increase of 3.343.537 pieces compared to last year: of which Japanese factories increased by 3.861.143 pieces, and Chinese factories decreased by 508.088 pieces; this shows that foreign factories are tending to spin and weave themselves. The decline in yarn prices this year is rare; the average market price of standard yarn fell by 13.2 yuan compared to last year; and 43.5 yuan compared to the year before; while the average cost of cotton was 43.75 yuan per dan, an increase of 0.12 yuan compared to last year; this phenomenon of expensive cotton and cheap yarn made it impossible for factories with weaker capital to maintain themselves. In the first half of the year, the number of spindles in operation nationwide was 4.678.272; and the number of spindles that were shut down was 1.214.267. Furthermore, the yarn inventory of various factories has reached the highest amount in recent years; taking the Shanghai market as an example, at the end of February this year, there were 165.704 bales, 32.636 bales more than the same month last year; at the end of March, there were 167.150 bales, 7.623 bales more than the same month the year before. Afterwards, yarn sales gradually became smoother; production was reduced; as a result, yarn inventory gradually decreased, and at the end of November, there were still 71.717 bales. In short: this year was the most difficult year for yarn factories; and foreign yarn factories have lower costs than Chinese yarn factories, making it even more difficult for Chinese yarn factories to stand. However, at the same time, Chinese yarn factories are still increasing the number of yarn spindles and looms every year, which shows the determination of the Chinese people to strive for survival without leaving any effort.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling Industry: In recent years, my country's silk exports have decreased sharply. This year, not only has there been no turnaround; the decline is even worse. At the end of the 22nd year, most of the more than 180 silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with more than 40,000 silk reeling machines, were shut down. This summer, silk prices were slightly higher and raw materials were still cheap, and the number of workers starting work began to increase, but most of them were still waiting and watching, waiting for the opportunity. Only 23 of the 108 factories in Shanghai were operating; only 33 of the 50 factories in Wuxi were operating; only 16 factories in Zhejiang province were operating; and most of them were temporarily raising funds to rent factories for silk reeling, sometimes working and sometimes not; and silk factories in Sichuan, Shandong, and Guangdong were also very declining. Sichuan silk factories are divided into iron machine and wooden machine types: in the 22nd year, there were still 19 iron machine silk factories, and in the first half of the 23rd year, there were still 11, and at the end of the year, all were shut down! The scale of wooden machine silk factories is smaller, mostly scattered in farmers' homes, and cannot be counted. Shandong silk factories are also divided into iron machine and wooden machine types: but there are very few iron machine silk factories; wooden machines are scattered in the countryside, all of which are family industries; after the Provincial Department of Construction persuaded farmers to organize silk reeling cooperatives and improve technology, they have made progress compared to before. As for Guangdong silk factories, only more than 50 were operating last year, a decrease of two-thirds compared to the heyday. However, because the silk market is in Europe and the United States; the competition of rayon and the world recession have all reduced the sales of silk; the daily exchange rate drop has favored the promotion of Japanese silk, making it even more impossible for Chinese silk to compete. The total amount of silk exported from our country throughout the year was about 33,000 dan, a decrease of 28% compared to last year. However, our country has low wages and light resources; if we can choose good cloth, improve quality, make progress in manufacturing, and promote it properly, it may not be impossible to revive.</p>
<p>Flour Industry: This year, there are a total of 89 flour mills operated by Chinese people nationwide, excluding the four northeastern provinces; of which Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces account for 36; Shandong and Henan provinces account for 25; Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces account for 6; and Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces account for 19. The total output of machine-made flour throughout the year is estimated to be about 27.6 million bags, an increase of 8% compared to last year. The total sales volume this year is estimated to be about 33.5 million bags, a decrease of 8% compared to last year. At the same time, the import of flour this year was 595.748 metric tons, a decrease of 70% compared to last year. In the first half of this year, flour prices were very low; the lowest price was only 1.93 yuan per bag; and the supply of raw materials was not connected to the new ones, and the market price of wheat did not fall with the flour price; the business of various factories was very depressed. However, after June, Jiangnan suffered a severe drought, people were uneasy, and hoarders in the interior absorbed spot goods one after another, and speculators took the opportunity to rise; as a result, Shanghai accumulated 3.5 million bags, which were sold out within a month. In addition, the completion of the Pingshen Railway allowed flour to be exported; as a result, the price of flour rose to more than 2 yuan per bag; and at the end of August, it even rose to 2.9 yuan per bag. Unfortunately, it gradually fell in September and October; as a result, most flour factories closed down at the end of the year, among which there were inevitably those who lost money; however, there were also not a few who made profits. The wheat, which is the raw material for manufacturing flour, mostly relies on imports; and this year, the wheat producing areas in our country, such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, have all suffered poor harvests, and the total output nationwide has decreased compared to last year; as a result, the cost of raw materials for factories in the interior has had to increase. In the future, if there can be a sufficient supply of domestic wheat, the cost can still be reduced. The flour industry will not be difficult to maintain a normal state.</p>
<p>Cigarette Industry: Most of the more than 70 cigarette factories nationwide are located in Shanghai; taking the 46 Chinese merchants in Shanghai who have joined the Cigarette Industry Association as an example; the total business of the whole year in the 23rd year, in terms of value: is only about 70% of the 22nd year; in terms of sales volume: it is about the same as last year. The total sales of Chinese merchants is more than 400,000 boxes; the sales of foreign merchants have decreased greatly. According to estimates: last year, the total turnover of Chinese and foreign factories nationwide reached 200 million yuan, and Chinese factories accounted for about 60%. The reason why Chinese factories can compete with foreign merchants; because the national economy is difficult and purchasing power is weak, those who used to like to smoke high-end foreign cigarettes have replaced them with cheaper domestic cigarettes; and Chinese cigarette factories can also reduce prices, add gifts, do their best to promote, and have thin profits and high quality; so they can make a little profit.</p>
<p>Match Industry: Since the increase in the match tariff rate in the 20th year, groups have set up new factories because they can make profits, and the output has increased suddenly. Production and sales cannot be balanced, and market prices are gradually falling. According to statistics in the unified tax area, in the current year, 19 Chinese factories in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas produced 194,000 boxes; and sold 195,000 boxes. 35 factories in the Shandong and Henan areas, produced 271,0</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>00 boxes, sold 272,000 boxes. 10 factories in the Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan areas, produced 131,000 boxes; and sold 154,000 boxes. 3 factories in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi areas, produced 34,000 boxes. Sold 34,000 boxes. A total of 630,000 boxes were produced; and 655,000 boxes were sold. The difference between production and sales is made up by last year's inventory. There are a total of six match factories that have started work in China, and this year they produced 85,800 boxes; and sold 73,500 boxes. Comparing the situation of the two years, although the output of Chinese factories this year increased by 10%; the sales volume decreased by 8%. The output of foreign factories decreased by 25%; and the sales volume decreased by 40%. As for the market price, each box fell by 7 yuan to 10 yuan. The factories have suffered losses in business, and although they continue to operate, there are 13 factories that have been shut down throughout the year; and more than 30 factories that have been shut down for a short period of time. Recently, there have been organizations for industry cooperation; but no significant results have been seen so far.</p>
<p>Cement Industry: From the 11th year of the Republic of China to the 21st year, the quantity and amount of cement imported into our country has increased year by year. It is estimated that the import in the 11th year of the Republic of China was 4,355 dan, and in the 21st year, it reached 3,670,201 dan: however, in the 22nd year, it decreased to 2,278,701 dan; and this year, the decrease was even greater, estimated at 1,303,038 dan. Most of the imported countries are neighboring countries, such as Annam, Hong Kong, Japan, and Macau, because of the short distance and convenient transportation. There are a total of seven cement factories operated by Chinese people, with a possible annual output of 4.13 million barrels; the actual output is probably no more than 4 million barrels. Although there is a lack of overall statistics on the actual output of factories across the country; the output of the four major factories in North China, Central China, and South China has increased year by year: in the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was 2.57 million barrels; in the 22nd year, it was 2.64 million barrels; and this year, it was 2.91 million barrels. As for the export of cement, it has decreased year by year. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was 400,000 dan; in the 21st year, it decreased to 36,000 dan; in the 22nd year, it decreased to 18,000 dan; and this year, it was only 6,750 dan. In recent years, the need for cement in domestic construction has been increasing day by day; recently, due to the military victory in suppressing bandits, the inland market has gradually expanded; and since the promulgation of the new tariff this year, the import of cement has been significantly reduced. Although the cement industry operated by Chinese people has not shown a rapid progress; given the vast area and large population of our country; the prosperity of urban construction; and the increasing number of new factories, bridges, and roads being built; the current output of factories operated by Chinese people is not enough to cope with the demand; therefore, the future of the cement industry should still have room for considerable development.</p>
<p>Sugar Industry: In recent years, the import of foreign sugar has decreased year by year, from 14 million dan in the 18th year of the Republic of China to 4.2 million dan in the 22nd year. The import this year is also only 4.1 million dan; of which about one-quarter is imported through Shanghai. The main source of imports is Java; followed by Hong Kong and Japan. As for the decrease in imports, it should be due to increased tariffs, increased smuggling; low purchasing power in the interior; and increased output of local sugar. This year, there has been no significant progress in the domestic sugar manufacturing industry; and the factories operated by Chinese people are still shut down as before. The provinces that produce sugarcane are raising funds to establish new-style sugar factories one after another. As of the end of this year, three sugar factories have been established in Guangdong Province, and it is expected that they will be shipped one after another next spring; Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces are also designing and planning to establish one sugar factory each. If they can proceed with determination and pay attention to costs, the restoration of the sugar industry is not far away!</p>
<p>Basic Chemical Industry: The import of acids and alkalis has increased and decreased alternately in recent years. In the 21st year, the import of acids was 117,000 dan, and alkalis was 833,000 dan; in the 22nd year, the import of acids was 154,000 dan, and alkalis was 859,000 dan; this year, the import of acids was 137,000 dan, and alkalis was 965,000 dan. The main source of imports is Japan for acids and the United Kingdom for alkalis. The total value of nitrogen industry products imported each year is more than 40 million yuan; taking ammonium sulfate fertilizer as an example: the import in the 21st year was 1.865 million tons; in the 22nd year, it was 1.674 million tons... this year, it was 826,000 dan. In recent years, Chinese people believe that it is necessary to establish factories to supply this basic raw material of the chemical industry themselves; therefore, acid, alkali, and nitrogen factories have been increasing every year since the 16th year of the Republic of China; as of the end of this year, there are six acid factories, seven alkali factories, and two nitrogen factories operated by Chinese people. Although the nitrogen factories are all under construction, it is expected that they will be shipped one after another in the autumn of the 24th year. In the 22nd year, acid factories produced a total of 243,000 dan of sulfuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acids, almost twice the amount of imported acids. Although there is no overall statistics on the output of acid factories this year; the import of the three acids has decreased by 18,213 tons compared to last year; this may be because foreigners want to keep them for their own use as national defense products: at the same time, it is also due to the efforts of Chinese people to advance in the manufacture of acids! As for alkalis, a total of 819,000 dan of soda ash, caustic soda, sodium silicate, and sodium sulfide were produced in the 22nd year, which is equivalent to the amount of imported alkalis; the output this year is no less than 900,000 dan, which is equal to the number of imports, among which soda ash has been exported; this must be attributed to the efforts of the alkali factories. The past achievements of the acid and alkali industries have been good; and the future development will naturally be on the rise. And the operators of the emerging nitrogen industry are originally the backbone of these two industries, and their future is predictable.</p>
<p>Overall, although the general industrial situation faces competition from foreign goods; it is not absolutely pessimistic. If the factories themselves can gradually improve, carefully calculate costs everywhere, and reduce expenses; at the same time, the outside world provides considerable assistance; so that the turnover is flexible; the national industrial policy must also establish a foundation for maintenance. With the richness of our country's products, the large population, and the low cost of the cotton industry, we only need to produce and sell ourselves; the current factory products are probably not enough to supply the domestic market!</p>

<h3>Business Operations in the Twenty-Third Year</h3>
<p>The business policy for the twenty-third year will continue to be based on the spirit of increasing the people's production and restoring the prosperity of the inland. Progress will be made gradually according to the bank's own capabilities. Unexpectedly, the silver problem occurred in the second half of the year, making it necessary to take appropriate precautions to maintain financial stability. However, we dare not shrink lending to avoid difficulties for industry and commerce. How to properly handle the balance between advancement and contraction is indeed the most difficult point for financial institutions to resolve.</p>
<h3>Business Operations</h3>
<p>(1) Industrial Lending: In the first half of the twenty-third year, domestic industry had not recovered from the exhaustion of the previous year. In the second half of the year, the price of silver soared, and foreign goods flooded in, causing the prices of general factory products to fall and compete. Manufacturers gradually realized that in order to survive, it was necessary to tighten their own spending, reduce costs, and improve quality. The bank, on the one hand, fulfilled its responsibility to make adjustments, and on the other hand, advised factories to improve themselves. The lending methods had to focus on the nature of the collateral, which had to be active and easy to circulate, so that the invested funds could have a corresponding guarantee and rapid turnover. At the end of the twenty-third year, the bank's industrial lending balance was 54,501,393 yuan, an increase of 12,118,225 yuan compared to last year. Of this, collateralized loans accounted for 47,155,643 yuan, or 86.41 percent; uncollateralized loans accounted for 7,418,050 yuan, or 13.59 percent. In terms of nature: term loans accounted for 29.5 percent; current loans accounted for 70.5 percent. The percentage of each industry is as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton textile industry (cotton spinning and weaving statistics merged this year) 62.93 Flour industry 14.12</p>
<p>Silk weaving industry 5.08 Cigarette industry 2.76</p>
<p>Oil industry 2.33 Egg industry 1.73</p>
<p>Baling and ginning industry 1.71 Brewing industry 1.44</p>
<p>Basic chemical industry 1.28 Iron and electrical machinery industry 1.03</p>
<p>Papermaking and printing industry 0.82 Knitting industry 0.70</p>
<p>Wool weaving industry 0.62 Match industry 0.59</p>
<p>Paint industry 0.52 Food and beverage industry 0.48</p>
<p>Building materials industry 0.39 Rice milling industry 0.23</p>
<p>Rubber industry 0.21 Applied chemical industry 0.18</p>
<p>Other industries 0.85</p>
<p>Small Industrial Loans: Most of China's small industries have evolved from handicrafts. They are easy to manage, have low expenses, low costs, and small inventories. Even in this economic downturn, they can barely survive. However, they lack working capital and have to borrow from outside at high interest rates. Years of hard work are only enough to pay interest. This year, the bank is piloting small industrial loans in Shanghai, with a maximum of 2,000 yuan per household and a minimum of 300 yuan, at a lower interest rate. The year-end balance of this item totaled more than 68,000 yuan. Since the pilot program began, small industries have found it quite convenient. Most of them have been able to maintain their credit and repay on time. At the end of the period, only about 12 percent of the total were extended or rolled over.</p>
<p>(2) Agricultural Lending: This year's agricultural lending can be divided into three categories: (1) Agricultural product secured loans; (2) Small farmer secured loans;</p>
<p>(3) Rural cooperative loans.</p>
<p>(A) Agricultural Product Secured Loans: This year, the bank used the facilities of its 509 warehouses as much as possible to provide agricultural product secured loans, in order to seek initial relief to stabilize prices. In the second half of this year, a total of more than 76 million yuan was made. Among them, food secured loans accounted for more than 17.24 million yuan; cotton, silk and other secured loans accounted for more than 59 million yuan. There were more than 16,000 secured households.</p>
<p>(B) Small Farmer Secured Loans: The bank also made small farmer secured loans as much as possible at the agricultural warehouses relatively close to the countryside in order to facilitate the circulation of rural finance. As of the end of the twenty-third year, a total of more than 1,125,000 yuan in secured loans had been made. Secured households numbered more than 9,000, with an average secured loan of more than 110 yuan per household.</p>
<p>(C) Rural Cooperative Loans: Rural cooperative loans not only provide farmers with production capital at low interest rates, but also rely on lending relationships to promote farmers' economic organization, agricultural improvement, and lifestyle improvement. The bank has been piloting this type of lending for three years. However, the scope of the pilot project has been slightly expanded this year. As of the end of the second half of the twenty-third year, a total of more than 1.97 million yuan in loans had been made. Of these, more than 1.33 million yuan had been successively recovered upon maturity. The remainder is expected to be fully recovered when it matures next spring. A total of 944 cooperatives have borrowing relationships with the bank, with more than 52,760 members, distributed in 40 counties in six provinces.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing More Inland Institutions: In order to promote the export of local products and facilitate the handling of goods by merchants, the bank added more branches in the inland areas where local products are collected and distributed this year: four in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces each; one in Hunan and Shandong provinces each; three in Henan province; two in Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces each; six in Hebei province; and one more in Shanghai, for a total of twenty-eight. Furthermore, due to the improvement of inland water and land transportation, the commercial situation has changed accordingly. The bank adapted to the times and relocated the relevant institutions to Weinan. It also abolished the Yaowan in Jiangsu Province, and the Tonghua, Taonan, Xinlitun, Sibujie, and Tai'anzhen institutions in the three northeastern provinces. There are currently a total of 203 branches.</p>
<p>(4) Assisting in the Transportation and Sale of Domestic Goods: In the twenty-third year, the total value of imports into China was more than 1,002,900,000 yuan, of which industrial products accounted for about 48 percent. A portion of these products are not yet manufactured in domestic factories. As for products that domestic factories can manufacture, they account for about 17 percent, worth more than 179 million yuan. If the production, transportation, and sale of domestic goods can be improved, with low prices and high quality, and society is happy to use them, it may not be a way to reduce the trade deficit. At the beginning of the year, the bank contacted domestic goods factories to jointly organize a domestic goods joint office to be responsible for procurement, a domestic goods joint transportation office to handle transportation, and promoted the establishment of domestic goods companies in suitable cities. As of the end of the year, seven companies have been established in Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Changsha, and Zhengzhou, and one domestic goods introduction office in Chongqing. The total daily business income averages around 20,000 yuan, and the annual estimate should be more than 7 million yuan. This is of some help in promoting the sale of domestic industrial products.</p>
<p>(5) Piloting Mail-Order Remittances: Many large bookstores, businesses, and factories have branches or wholesale outlets in various ports that operate directly. However, because the branches are not widespread, merchants often find it inconvenient to purchase goods. In order to promote mail-order purchasing, the bank signed contracts with major bookstores, businesses, and factories to handle purchasing through the bank's more than 200 branches. The procedures are simple and the remittance fees are low, with some even waiving remittance fees. Currently, there are eight contracted factories and businesses. This method allows the entrusted businesses to expand the sales of goods, and customers in the area can also purchase goods from outside ports at lower prices. The bank acts as an assistant to the industrial and commercial sectors, which will increase remittance business. Since the pilot program began in Shanghai, all parties have found it convenient.</p>
<p>(6) Taking Over the Construction Funds for the Yuehan Railway and the Yunan Railway: The proposal to build the Yuehan Railway dates back to the twenty-second year of the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty. After several twists and turns, the Guangshao section began construction in the thirty-second year of Guangxu and was completed in the fifth year of the Republic of China. The Wuchang section began construction in the first year of the Republic of China and connected with the Xiang Railway in Changsha in the seventh year, opening to traffic to Zhuzhou. Funding ran out, so the section from Zhuzhou to Shaozhou, which is 451 kilometers long, could not be continued. It was not until the twenty-second year that the Ministry of Railways and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board negotiated a loan and allocated a portion of the Boxer Indemnity to be returned to the Ministry of Railways as a fund for issuing bonds. The bank, together with the central government, the Ministry of Communications, and HSBC, negotiated to take over the issuance of bonds. After a year, on June 1 of the thirteenth year, bonds totaling 1,500,000 pounds were issued, with an annual interest rate of 6 percent. Principal repayment began on January 1 of the twenty-fourth year and continued until January 1 of the thirty-sixth year, when all principal and interest were fully repaid. From then on, the Yuehan Railway had construction funds, and the north-south trunk line, which had been suspended for seventeen years, was expected to be completed soon. The north-south communication will be of great benefit to the political and economic future. The planning of the Yunan section's funding was briefly described in last year's report. At the beginning of this year, the bank was entrusted by the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces to negotiate the investment method with the German Dawaerfu Company. As a result of the negotiations, the German company provided a loan for materials totaling 8 million national currency units. All procedures were completely entrusted to the bank, and it did not directly participate in railway administration and technical matters. Then, the bank, together with Jin Cheng, Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, Xinhua, Jiangxi Yumin, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, organized a syndicate to borrow 8 million yuan in cash as the road's construction costs. At the same time, the central government and the governments of the two provinces jointly formed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company, and the highest management and supervisory powers were handed over to the board of directors jointly organized by the central and local governments and the syndicate. Since construction of the road began in July of the twenty-third year, progress has been rapid, and it is expected to be open to traffic by the end of the twenty-fourth year. This road is the east-west trunk line in central China, and its value should not be less than that of the Longhai Railway.</p>
<p>(7) Reorganization of the Banknote Deposits of the Zhangguang Branch: The former Guangzhou branch of the bank was affected by the political upheaval in the twelfth year of the Republic of China and suspended operations. All the money owed to the branch by the former Guangdong government was repeatedly negotiated, but there was no way to repay it. As a result, the branch was unable to reorganize the banknotes it had issued and various deposits. However, in order to maintain the bank's reputation, the bank specially reorganized the previously issued banknotes and deposits in the spring of this year, and it has now come to an end. The public is satisfied with the bank's efforts to maintain its credit.</p>
<p>(8) Reconstruction of the Shanghai Office Building: The office building of the Shanghai branch on Renji Road on the Bund was originally the site of the German General Association and was not a building suitable for banking operations. Since the General Management Office moved from Beijing to Shanghai in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the office space has become even more cramped. In order to save money, the bank made do with what it had, but it has been used for several wars. Later, because the building had been around for too many years, the wall base moved, and the roof split, it was necessary to find another business location to ensure safety. Remodeling a new building was inevitable, so last year we first gradually recovered the goods out of the building at No. 50 Hankou Road and repaired it slightly. The General Management Office, the International Department, the Trust Department, the Shanghai Branch, and the Insurance Company can all move in successively in the spring of the twenty-fourth year. The construction of the new building is in line with the bank's consistent prudent principles and is being handled carefully. Although it must meet the requirements of appearance, it is especially necessary to estimate the cost. It must be practical and suitable for its own use, and not just flaunt extravagance. It should be about ten stories high to be suitable for use. It is still in the process of careful design.</p>
<h3>Business of the Bank of China in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>In the first half of this year, capital was excessive. Although our bank reduced deposit interest rates, the increase in deposits continued as before, and there was no reliable way to generate profits. In the second half of the year, the silver problem occurred, and credit suddenly tightened. The need for funds from all parties was almost impossible to meet. Therefore, the difficulty of doing business in the 23rd year was unprecedented. Our bank has adhered to its consistent policy. When capital is excessive and the market is relaxed, we are wary of the inevitability of cycles and dare not be careless, preferring to endure losses. When the market is tight, we weigh the priorities, maintain normal operations, and fulfill our due responsibilities. However, can the bank's ability to meet the needs of the outside world always correspond? And among priorities and urgencies, there are different subjective views. This is why the financial community cannot be understood by the business community, and the position sought by our bank cannot fully satisfy everyone. This is inevitable. Even the financial communities in Europe and the United States cannot avoid this. However, the survival and relief of the national economy depend on the thorough cooperation of the financial community, specialized fields, government, and society. The recovery of the British economy during the recession is a precedent. Our bank is willing to uphold the spirit of the bank and society as one, as a guiding principle for future operations.</p>
<p>(A) Business Overview</p>
<p>(1) Deposits</p>
<p>A. Total Deposits: The total balance of various deposits in the 23rd year was 546,693,902.59, an increase of 7,409,375.43 compared to the 22nd year. The analysis and comparison are as follows: (1) The balance of current deposits was 182,856,037.19, a decrease of 6,913,053.49 compared to the 22nd year; (2) The balance of fixed deposits was 251,884,333.58, an increase of 40,683,484.35 compared to the 22nd year; (3) The balance of interbank deposits was 111,953,531.82, a decrease of 26,361,055.43 compared to the 22nd year.</p>
<p>The increase or decrease in the above-mentioned fixed and current deposits roughly reflects the trend of the depressed market and the difficulty in generating profits in the 13th year. Depositors prefer to entrust a large portion of their funds to more stable avenues and dare not invest in businesses. The large decrease in interbank deposits indicates the tightness of the market at the end of the 23rd year. The percentages of fixed and current deposits of our bank in the 22nd and 23rd years are listed below for comparison:</p>
<p>Year 22 Year 23</p>
<p>Current Deposits 47.33 42.05</p>
<p>Fixed Deposits 52.67 57.95</p>
<p>B. Number of Depositors: The number of depositors in the 23rd year was 170,200, an increase of 33,471 compared to the 136,729 in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>C. Nature of Deposits: The percentages of various deposits in the 23rd year, classified by depositors, compared to the 22nd year, are as follows:</p>
<p>Year 22 Year 23</p>
<p>Individual and Group Deposits 50.20 62.88</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Deposits 45.66 31.34</p>
<p>Government Agency Deposits 4.14 5.78</p>
<p>(2) Loans</p>
<p>A. Total Loans: The total balance of various loans in the 23rd year was 441,952,175.01, an increase of 60,563,565.86 compared to the 22nd year. The analysis and comparison are as follows: (1) The balance of current loans and overdrafts was 184,187,435.49, an increase of 58,342,858.95 compared to the 22nd year; (2) The amount of fixed loans was 197,761,116.77, an increase of 8,622,426.19 compared to the 22nd year; (3) The balance of discounted and purchased forward bills was 30,003,622.75, a decrease of 6,401,719.28 compared to the 22nd year.</p>
<p>In the loan season of this year, our bank had to moderately increase the amount of loans to meet the needs of the sluggish markets in various regions, averaging about 15% more than in the 22nd year. To further enhance the flexibility of funds and increase efficiency, we slightly emphasized lending current loans and overdrafts. Therefore, fixed loans increased by 4.5% compared to the 22nd year, while current loans and overdrafts increased by 46.3% compared to the 22nd year.</p>
<p>In addition, this year, we continued to vigorously promote the direct acceptance of forward bills for local products in the interior, in order to practically subsidize the transportation and sale of goods. In mid-November, the highest outstanding balance of funds used for forward bills and export bills reached 40.08 million yuan.</p>
<p>B. Nature of Loans: The percentages of various loans in the 23rd year, analyzed by usage, compared to the 22nd year, are as follows:</p>
<p>Year 22 Year 23</p>
<p>Commerce 27.02 29.77</p>
<p>Industry 12.08 13.25</p>
<p>Agriculture and Agricultural Products 4.81 5.38</p>
<p>Public Utilities 0.97 1.08</p>
<p>Transportation 1.41 2.15</p>
<p>Year 22 Year 23</p>
<p>Interbank 6.56 2.15</p>
<p>Government Agencies 43.90 41.91</p>
<p>Groups 0.73 1.08</p>
<p>Individuals 2.52 3.23</p>
<p>Total 100.00 100.00</p>
<p>(3) Remittances</p>
<p>A. Total Remittances for the Year: The total amount of remittances received by our bank in the 23rd year was 834,233,000 yuan,</p>
<p>an increase of 79,512,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year.</p>
<p>B. Remittance Areas: This year's remittances, analyzed by domestic regions, to observe their growth and decline, the percentages of the 22nd and 23rd years are compared as follows:</p>
<p>Region Year 22 Year 23</p>
<p>Yangtze River Basin 59.3 63.1</p>
<p>North China 17.7 15.6</p>
<p>Northeast 10.0 8.7</p>
<p>South China 13.0 12.6</p>
<p>C. Remittances In and Out of Ports: The report for the 22nd year briefly described the tendency of cash concentration in ports, as evidenced by remittances through our bank. This trend seems to have not diminished this year. However, during the winter, due to the lack of cash in the interior and the transfer of funds, most cash was transported directly, without going through remittance procedures. The percentages of remittances in and out of our bank in the 23rd year, analyzed by port and interior, are as follows:</p>
<p>Port Outward Remittances 32.91 Interior Outward Remittances 67.09</p>
<p>Port Inward Remittances 72.91 Interior Inward Remittances 27.09</p>
<p>(4) Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The foreign exchange business in the 23rd year made significant progress compared to the 22nd year. The total volume of foreign exchange business in the 22nd year was equivalent to 956,143,000 silver dollars, while it increased to 989,446,000 yuan in the 23rd year, an increase of 33,303,000 yuan. If calculated in US dollars, the increase is even greater.</p>
<p>(5) Issuance of Convertible Notes</p>
<p>At the end of the 23rd year, the total amount of convertible notes in circulation at our bank was 204,713,465.41, an increase of 20,986,468.04 compared to the total amount in circulation at the end of the 22nd year. In terms of convertible note reserves, cash reserves totaled 129,660,826.89, accounting for 63% of the total amount in circulation. Guarantee reserves totaled 75,052,638.52 (securities 61,617,268.49, real estate deeds 6,461,375.03, and the rest is guarantee reserves for bank branches receiving notes), accounting for 37% of the total amount in circulation.</p>
<p>(6) Securities</p>
<p>At the end of the 23rd year, the total amount of securities held by our bank was 86,981,599.06 (guarantee reserve portion 61,617,268.49, business portion 25,364,330.57), accounting for 8.8% of total assets, an increase of 5,134,551.15 compared to 81,847,045.91 in the 22nd year. This increase was due to the sharp increase in fixed deposits, for the purpose of diversifying investments. The percentages of gold and silver securities are listed below:</p>
<p>End of Year 23 End of Year 21</p>
<p>Silver Securities 79.2 77.1</p>
<p>Gold Securities 20.8 22.9</p>
<p>(7) Profit and Loss</p>
<p>A. Various Expenses: Various expenses in the 23rd year were more than 6.666 million yuan, an increase of more than 612,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. Our bank's various expenses, including operating expenses, increased sharply due to the increase in postal and telecommunications rates in the 23rd year. The increase in our bank's business and the establishment of new branches in this year were also the main reasons for the increase in expenses.</p>
<p>B. Profit Distribution: The net profit for the 23rd year was 1,933,317.01. After deducting 10% as a public reserve fund according to regulations, which is 193,331.70, the remaining amount was 1,739,985.31. This amount, plus the accumulated surplus of 6,540.28 from previous years, minus the distributed official and commercial shares of 7% regular interest of 1,729,854.00, leaves a balance of 16,671.59, which is still listed under the accumulated surplus. Our bank's unpaid capital of 287,800 yuan was fully paid up at the end of the 23rd year. However, since interest started from January 1, 24th year, the dividend for the 23rd year was still calculated based on the original paid-up capital of 24,712,200 yuan.</p>

<h3>Why Exercise?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>Foreigners often say: "To have a strong mind, there is only exercise." When these two sentences reach the ears of us Chinese people, we will object: "In ancient China, scholars were generally stooped and hunchbacked, refined and courteous, and only knew how to study diligently all day long. They didn't know anything about exercise. But they could write beautiful articles. Moreover, their minds were smarter and stronger than those who exercise now." Although these words are well-founded, when you think about it, what foreigners say is not wrong at all. Think about it, although the scholar's mind is strong and smart, it is only temporary. Because they don't exercise, they are so weak in their youth. When they get old, their bodies and spirits will be even weaker, and then their minds will become dull!</p>
<p>Now, those of us who exercise regularly have bodies that are certainly well-trained and strong. If we reach old age, we will definitely be energetic, and our minds will never become dull.</p>
<p>Dear children! Do you think this is right?</p>
<h3>How to Befriend Children</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>The psychology of adults and children is completely different. Adults are affected by the environment, and all aspects are transformed. Of course, the innocence of childhood will not be present in adulthood. Therefore, to befriend children, the first prerequisite is to know the nature of children. If you don't know the nature of children, you can't talk about this issue at all.</p>
<p>From which aspects can we know the nature of children? Now I will offer what I know to the readers:</p>
<p>(1) (Games) Games are the natural inclination of children. Before compulsory education is implemented in schools, games are the nature of children. Some people say that games are the second life of children, which is indeed true. Children are different from adults. Children's games are their work, not rest. It is their unique, insignificant work with happy emotions. In order to develop children's natural instincts, we must let them fully express their intelligence. This is how their intelligence can be seen in games. Therefore, when children are playing, we must not prohibit them.</p>
<p>(2) (Speaking) Children have just come into contact with the world from their mother's womb. They are unfamiliar with everything in the world. Of course, they cannot speak the current language, but they have inspiration, and of course they also have things they want to say. Therefore, they have to express themselves through gestures and actions. Therefore, adults must pay attention to their every move, because their every move is driven by inner desires. When they are babbling, they are actually talking. We must not be unaware of their speech.</p>
<p>(3) (Thinking) Children's thinking gradually progresses, so their thinking often changes. To be close to them, we must first know their thoughts. In the first year of a child's life, they can only use perception to create thought processes. After that, their thinking changes again. They can feel, they can remember, and their thinking changes to another mode, using imagination and association to act. The properties of factual objects and the characteristics of concepts are clarified. Judgment and reasoning can also be used. Thus, the so-called intellectual function of children, the only mental activity of human beings, also reaches its peak. Generally, looking at children with the methods of adults cannot see children with the eyes of children, so there are many misunderstandings about children. Adults cannot trace the evolutionary process of children's thinking, so the methods of developing their thinking are also mostly wrong. If you comment on children's thinking with adult eyes, what children think is often unreasonable. If you use these unreasonable methods to blame and despise them, they will be oppressed and dare not speak more in the future. Therefore, adults should pay more attention to suppressed children's thoughts.</p>
<p>(4) (Emotion) Observing from the children's spiritual life, emotion is the most closely related, that is, instinct and temperament. When instinct is discovered, there is always an emotion mixed in it. The discovery of instinct, whether appropriate or not, can cause simple emotions of comfort or discomfort to joy, anger, love, and happiness. And the most important thing to pay attention to is not to use adult emotions to infer children's emotions.</p>
<p>The above is the knowledge you should have about being friends with children. Now I want to talk about the methods:</p>
<p>(1) (Intimacy) Children are most afraid of fierce actions. If you gradually contact them with intimate methods, they will eventually become your friends in the same boat.</p>
<p>(2) (Guidance) Children often have many questions. If you answer them for them, they will be very grateful to you and will be happy to be friends with you.</p>
<p>(3) (Playing) Children consider playing to be their compulsory course. Therefore, adults should be with them, take off the masks of adults, and also deliberately show the childishness of children. Then they can get their sympathy.</p>
<h3>Air and Breathing</h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>Min'er's father is a chemistry teacher, so when Min'er sees his father free, he asks him to perform magic tricks for him. But his father also likes to perform for him.</p>
<p>One afternoon, his father bought two glass bottles and asked Min'er to bring a bowl of limewater and soak the lime in the water. After a while, the lime dissolved into a turbid water. After filtering the water once, it became clear water again.</p>
<p>Min'er asked in surprise, "Dad! Is this clear water? Or limewater?"</p>
<p>His father said, "This is limewater. Because all the undissolved lime has been filtered out, and the lime that has already dissolved is dissolved in the water, even your own eyes deceive you into thinking it is clear water."</p>
<p>Then his father poured equal amounts of limewater into the two glass bottles he had just bought and installed three glass tubes in the mouths of the two bottles (see picture). The magic trick was about to begin.</p>
<p>His father pinched the D tube with his finger and sucked the E tube with his mouth, so that air was drawn in from the A bottle. Then he pinched the C tube with his finger and released the D tube, so that the inhaled air was exhaled from the B bottle. Then you could see that when the air passed through the A bottle, the lime in the bottle did not change. When the air exhaled from the mouth passed through the B bottle, the limewater in the bottle turned into milk-like water.</p>
<p>Min'er found this magic trick very interesting, but he didn't understand the reason at all, so he asked his father, "Dad, how did the two bottles of clear limewater turn into milk-like water after you blew on them? What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>His father said, "Don't rush, let me tell you one by one. We humans exhale carbon dioxide and inhale oxygen, while plants exhale oxygen and inhale carbon dioxide. If there is no air for a day, we will all die, which shows that we and plants have a close relationship. This magic trick can prove that after air passes through human breathing, the oxygen in the air changes in the human body and becomes carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide). After carbonic acid gas passes through limewater, it changes and becomes a white precipitate. Therefore, it is very inappropriate to live in a house with many people and closed windows. In the future, you should not go to the movies anymore. And you should not put flowers in the bedroom at night, because plants exhale oxygen and inhale carbon dioxide at night, and there is very little oxygen in the air, which is very unhygienic."</p>
<h3>"Namowan" (Tadpole)</h3>
<p>— Hong Shimeng</p>
<p>How beautiful the countryside is in spring! The fields are a verdant green, mixed with golden rapeseed flowers, and the new leaves of the trees are like a layer of light green gauze. Children, if you travel to the countryside, you may encounter a ditch, and you will always be tempted to go to the shore to see it. Be careful not to slip into the ditch. Ah! Look! There are many black dots floating in the water, and they are dragging a small tail! That little tail wags flexibly and nimbly, in groups and arrays, how beautiful! Several children tried their best to catch a few and put them in a glass bottle they brought, ready to come back and ask their father or teacher what these things are.</p>
<p>Children, let me tell you, these are called tadpoles (pronounced "ke dou"). In the dictionary, they are also called "huo dong", but many children in Shanghai call them "namowan". These are the larvae of frogs (i.e., toads). The original frog larvae are round like peppercorns when they are first born, and they cannot move at that time. After a while, they grow tails and can swim. This is when their life begins. These are the "namowan" that the children catch. After a while, their bodies grow bigger, and first a pair of small hind legs grow, followed by a pair of front legs, and the tail gradually shortens and disappears. These are small frogs. Frogs can eat the pests in the fields, so they are good friends of farmers. Let's sing a tadpole song. If you don't know how to sing this song, you can ask the music teacher to teach you, and maybe the teacher will agree to your request.</p>

<h3>The Gluttonous Little Mouse</h3>
<p>— One Shock</p>
<p>In the dark night, the little mouse waited until all the human voices had disappeared and jumped out of the hole. A strange aroma of meat wafted into its nose.</p>
<p>"Good stuff! I haven't eaten in three days!"</p>
<p>The little mouse sniffed its nose, and drool flowed from its mouth. It jumped and jumped to the top of the bed where it often played. The smell of meat was really coming from here. A piece of braised pork was hanging in an interesting iron cage. A strange aroma of meat wafted. The little mouse's drool flowed from its mouth. Its finger touched the cage.</p>
<p>"No, this is a trap of cruel humans!"</p>
<p>The little mouse sat back on its hind legs, and its heart became cold again! It remembered its father's words:</p>
<p>"Don't eat easily obtained food, this is a trap for people!"</p>
<p>Thinking of these words, it jumped and jumped away, but the strange aroma of meat and its own hungry stomach could not bear to give up.</p>
<p>The footsteps of the stupid big brother next door also came out.</p>
<p>"It's okay to go in and grab it and run out, right? Don't let big brother get there first." Thinking this, it carefully squeezed into the cage. Its teeth latched onto the pork and pulled it outward with force. Suddenly——</p>
<p>"Clatter!" The cage door fell! An iron bolt came down, and the little mouse hurriedly released the meat and ran out. Its head crashed violently against the iron door and bounced back a long way, and it fainted!</p>
<p>"Don't eat easily obtained food, this is a trap for people!"</p>
<h3>The Dented Ping Pong Ball</h3>
<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>Children! Don't we always play ping pong in school? But when picking up the ball, we often dent the ping pong ball due to momentary recklessness, which leads to the responsibility of compensation. Isn't this a hateful thing? Now there is a method that can restore a ping pong ball that has been dented but not damaged to its original round shape. After being restored, it is still no different from a new one.</p>
<p>The method is as follows: Just throw the dented ping pong ball into boiling water. After a few minutes, it will be restored to its original round shape. What is the reason for this? All objects expand when heated and contract when cooled. Now, put the ball in boiling water, and the gas inside the ball gradually expands when heated. Therefore, the relationship of expansion causes the dented ping pong ball to gradually return to its original round shape. If there is already undamaged, this method will not be effective.</p>
<p>We are the new force of the times, driving the giant wheel forward!</p>

<h3>The Story of Children Eating - Strange Candy</h3>
<p>— Written by Xi Guansheng</p>
<p>The wind is no longer as bitterly cold as in winter, nor as scorching hot as in summer. It crosses the vast ocean from the end of the East Sea, blowing towards our continent, turning the windmills of the mills, bringing back home the drifting boats that have been wandering for years, awakening the hibernating insects and withered grass, and blowing open the children's dull and lonely hearts. When it blows through the Garden of Happiness, the Children's Day venue is crowded with attending children, singing party songs and shouting slogans. Colorful slogans are scattered on the ground. It—the wind—blows hard with all its might, and the colorful paper dances in the air, as beautiful as rubber butterflies. The Garden of Happiness is filled with joy, innocence, and vitality.</p>
<p>After the Children's Day ceremony, everyone remembers the speeches of the chairman and the guests. Back home, the clever Xiao Aihua can still recite a few sentences, "... cultivate children's habit of using domestic goods, and build children's psychology of resisting foreign goods and recovering rights and interests in the future..." After returning home, he often recites it in his mouth, and he still recites it like this in bed at night.</p>
<p>Someone is knocking on the door outside. The ones who come in are Uncle Zong, his father's fellow villager, and Uncle Yang, his father's foreign friend. When they see Xiao Aihua, they stroke his head and say to his father, "I like this angel, so I'm sending a small gift to celebrate Children's Day today." As they speak, they instruct the coachmen outside to bring in two large bags of candy and place them on the table. The father accepts the gift and tells Xiao Aihua to bow to the two friends to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>After the guests leave, the older brother and sister come back and see the candy on the table, clamoring to eat candy. The mother says, "Children, everyone eat Uncle Zong's candy! There are airplanes, cannons, and bombs in Uncle Yang's candy, it will be terrible if you eat it!" The mother goes upstairs, and the older brother and sister secretly open the candy sent by Uncle Yang, eating it in their mouths. The candy is really beautiful and dazzling, and the sweet taste sends into Xiao Aihua's nostrils. He takes a telescope-like strange candy, playing with it in his hand, putting it on his eyes and looking inside. Inside, there is a large machine, and Uncle Yang is controlling it on it. It can suck in our silver dollars, dimes, and copper coins, and turn them into airplanes, guns, cannons, bombs, gas, warships, and tanks, coming out from the iron gate below.

<p>Yarn Sales Can Be Described as Brisk</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are considered quite good, with a total of 1,114 bales traded including the previous day's figures. Prices have risen slightly. The purchase amounts by various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan 80, Sichuan 525, Guangdong 865, Inland 90,</p>
<p>Same Trade 70, Jiangxi 370, Changsha 70, Ningbo 20,</p>

<h3>Increased Tax Triggers Standard Cotton Buying</h3>
<p>The cotton market advanced in the morning but retreated in the afternoon; market sentiment remained positive. Most people are inclined to go long due to rumors, especially regarding the increased import tax on cotton, which is being widely discussed, leading to increased buying. However, the last traded price for March was 32.85 yuan, while the closing price for April is now 34.40 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to the March closing price.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Market Sentiment is Strong</p>
<p>At the opening of the sample cotton market, prices for all months rose sharply, and buying interest in the market was intense due to various rumors, all favoring the bulls. Gold prices rose at one point, and new sellers in the market were relatively scarce. However, far-month contracts reached 35 yuan, staying within the 5 yuan range, and some profits were taken, with some new shorts entering the market. Therefore, the market situation softened slightly. As a result, near-month prices rose by 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and far-month prices rose by 0.3 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the market suddenly weakened. It was heard that gold prices had retreated slightly, and third-grade cotton prices fell by 1.56 yuan at the close. There were bearish news about US cotton, dampening sentiment. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Chang Feng sold 2,800 dan, Run Kang 1,600 dan, Rui Da 2,800 dan, Yuan Da 5,000 dan, Jin Chang 4,000 dan, He Xing 3,200 dan, Geng Feng 2,000 dan, Yong Da 2,300 dan, De Ji 1,800 dan, Chang He 3,200 dan, and Yi Chang 1,700 dan. Ji Feng bought 5,500 dan, Da Fu 8,000 dan, Da Feng 2,500 dan, Yu Da 1,700 dan, Chang Yu 3,000 dan, Tong Xing 2,100 dan, Chang Feng 3,900 dan, Sheng Yuan 3,600 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 5,200 dan, Tong Ji 2,500 dan, and Chang He 2,900 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>

<p>Small Factory Sales are Not Bad</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are stagnant, with only scattered needs from various factories, which can still be maintained, it is said.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 49.00 Shenxin Factory Purchased 230 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Also 48.375 Shanghai Factory Purchased 400 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 41.75 Donghua Factory Purchased 100 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Also 41.25 Dongmian Firm Purchased 400 Pieces Spot Delivery to Warehouse</p>
<h3>Near and Far Term U.S. Cotton are Approaching Each Other</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with a flat and weak market condition. Each month fell by one to five points. Business was quiet, and market sentiment was uncertain. Subsequently, foreign merchants sold, influenced by the reform of the Belgian currency system and political instability abroad. Long positions in May were liquidated, and Southern merchants sold far-month contracts, weakening the market price. Local merchants bought old cotton, as the difference between near and far months may be narrowing. Speculators are paying particular attention to this. Later, local merchants bought again, and shorts covered, improving the market price. Current demand is stagnant, and sellers are scarce. Hester estimates this week's factory usage at 235,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory at 293,000 bales. The close was firm, with spot prices rising by 5 points and futures rising by 2 to 7 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 5 points and futures fell by 2 to 4 points. Indian cotton longs were liquidated, and the British pound was firm and high, causing significant market fluctuations. According to calculations, Pingguo Ru rose by 0.75 rupees, Aomula rose by half a rupee, and Bai Luo Xi remained unchanged. Original telegrams are listed on the left (dated 28th):</p>

<h3>Grain: Foreign Rice Suddenly Jumps Two Jiao; 60,000 Bags Sold Throughout the Day; He Xia Rice Weak in the North and Strong in the South</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, shipments from various firms arrived gradually due to previous wind delays, resulting in a large number of ships, totaling 50 (with nearly 10,000 shi of goods). However, most of them were Bo Dao rice, with Hou Geng rice accounting for only a small portion. Initially, Bo Dao rice showed signs of softening, but fortunately, some firms from Tianjin, Beiping, Yantai, and Weihaiwei successively purchased 1,400 to 1,500 bags, bringing the arrivals and sales into balance. The market color stabilized. Hou Geng rice, relying on limited arrivals and matching local sales, did not experience significant price fluctuations. Yin Bian and other grades remained stable.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, approximately 30 rice ships from He Xia arrived, but sales were flat. Arrivals of Bo Dao rice continued, but scattered sales were slow. Market prices for Bai Geng rice were slightly softer, while Bo Dao rice was down a small fraction. Bai Yuan rice was down a small amount, and the rest showed a weakening trend.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Recently, the market has repeatedly rumored an increase in taxes on foreign rice. Although the tax increase has not been officially announced, industry insiders predict that, although it may not happen immediately, it is likely to be implemented sooner or later due to the government's financial difficulties. This has prompted customers to buy. Yesterday's market price soared, driven not only by strong sales in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but also by inquiries from major firms in Ningbo and the Yangtze River (Nanjing). Market sentiment was high, and transactions were brisk. The market price jumped by one or two jiao. Total sales of various foreign rice exceeded 60,000 bags, with Saigon No. 1 accounting for more than half. Ke Xian inventory was insufficient, with only 500 bags sold, and prices also rose by one jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour, Wheat, Bean Cake Deliveries Still Numerous</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for March flour futures. The total delivery volume for the day reached 123,000 bags, delivered by Fuxin No. 2, No. 3, and No. 7 factories. The recipients were all real sales firms from the chemical industry. Local firms took 10,000 bags. It is said that other factories had also pre-drawn supplies for customer firms, with the total amount reaching over 100,000 bags. Regarding whether spot prices will increase, it will depend on how sales perform. However, most people believe that the increase is unlikely to be cancelled for the time being.</p>
<p>Yesterday, commodity deliveries were formally carried out, with standard Cao Huang beans being the most active. This is because rural inventories, which are prepared for the ten regions, continue to be purchased, leading to a gradual expansion of the exchange's trading volume, reaching a significant 100 truckloads. This shows the strong arrivals beforehand. Wheat deliveries have decreased, with only 12 truckloads, mostly local wheat, with only two or three truckloads of foreign wheat. Bean cake deliveries totaled 6,000 pieces, but sales were sluggish due to the current off-season.</p>

<h3>Hankou Gao Zha Beans Are Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market was generally stable. However, Hankou Gao Zha beans were in short supply and actively traded, leading to tight market conditions. Prices rose by three to five fen per round. Yesterday, Gao beans opened at 3.59 yuan. The only outlets for Hankou Late beans were Fuquan, with limited activity, making it difficult for the market to develop. Yesterday, three truckloads of Tongshi Guan Yihou beans were priced at 3.55 to 3.58 yuan. Two truckloads of Yingzhou beans were priced at 3.99 to 3.58 yuan. 140 bags of Mingguang beans were priced at 3.30 yuan. One truckload of Wulongji beans was priced at 3.425 yuan. Over 800 bags of Hankou Zha beans were priced from 3.59 to 3.60 yuan. 500 bags of Hankou Late beans were priced from 3.33 to 3.26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Only 20% of New Jinshan Branches Survive</h3>
<p>According to recent information from Guangdong, only 30% of the new Jinshan branches have survived. The harvest this year is bound to be poor, leading to uniform price increases. For example, high-quality Yuan Yuan brand is priced at 60 yuan. As sales remain slow, firms are reluctant to purchase, and no new prices have been discovered.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Land Prices Continue to Rise by Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news that the tax increase would be temporarily delayed. However, the supply of Dutch Coarse White sugar in April is expected to decrease, so although the market price softened, the decline was limited. The association set the price for 14 Coarse Sand White sugar at 17.80 yuan, a decrease of half a jiao, with some transactions. Transshipment goods were offered at 5.50 yuan but did not sell. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned 2,900 bags of Guangdong Coarse Sand White sugar, including 1,500 bags of Gao Zhuang, with a bid price of 17.80 yuan, and the slightly inferior Zhuang at 17.70 yuan, all of which were sold. Mian White Zhenyu No. 1 from the local factory was priced at 17.50 yuan, No. 2 at 4 jiao, No. 3 at 2 jiao, and No. 4 at 1 jiao, an increase of 6 jiao per week. As Shantou land prices for Chaoqing rose again by two or three jiao, local firms were generally unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in only scattered sales. Ti Zhuang Qing was priced at 10.80 yuan, and Huanggang Qing at 10.40 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao. Over 200 bags of Mian Chi were priced from 11.80 to 11.56 yuan for the higher grade and 10.80 yuan for the lower grade. Over 300 bags of Mian Hu White were priced from 16.78 to 16.45 yuan.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Shantou, the land price for Zhiyang White is 12.50 yuan, Ti Qing is 10.20 yuan, Shang Jie Qing is 10 yuan, and Gao Long Qing is 9.20 yuan. The trend is firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Qimen Tea Industry Returns to Prosperity</h3>
<p>The Qimen tea industry was previously affected by banditry in the producing areas and tight credit in Shanghai, leading tea warehouses and firms to be hesitant in their business. However, according to a letter from Qimen, the banditry in the Qifu areas has subsided, and 70% of the 280+ tea factories and firms have resumed operations. The Four Provinces Farmers Bank has allocated 100,000 yuan to assist rural economies and has lent the funds to various factories and firms. The bank's direct investment in the tea industry is unprecedented in Qimen. Furthermore, Shanghai tea warehouses have been busy negotiating lending matters, and the situation is becoming lively again.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>Children are the masters of the future society. Therefore, in our China, which has countless unresolved problems, the issue of children was surprisingly raised last year, and this year was designated as Children's Year, with preparations for a large-scale promotional campaign for Children's Year on this year's "April 4th" Children's Day. Although it has been postponed to next year due to insufficient preparation, the concern for children's issues seems to be a reality.</p>
<p>However, upon closer examination of the planned activities for the Children's Year campaign, they are nothing more than national children's health competitions, sports competitions, and speech contests. In addition, there are children's concerts, national children's touring teams, etc. If Chinese children were all qualified and had the opportunity to participate in these activities, wouldn't that be a wonderful thing? But the reality is that there are many unsatisfactory aspects.</p>
<p>The so-called children's problem originally revolves around the issues of "education" and "upbringing." When we talk about children's education and upbringing, we first think of the adults—the children's parents—and their living conditions. In the years of domestic and foreign troubles, rural bankruptcy, and industrial and commercial depression, the lives of ordinary people in our country are struggling on the brink of life and death. How can we talk about children's education and upbringing? Therefore, Chinese children, except for a few lucky ones, are either left to live and die on their own or are tragically killed. There are two ways to be killed. One is abortion, and the other is being drowned or abandoned. Abortion in China, where medicine is still in its infancy, is extremely dangerous, and the law also imposes penalties. However, there are still many people who resort to abortion. Which woman doesn't have maternal instincts? Who would be willing to break the law and risk killing a future little life? Of course, there are compelling reasons behind this. Most of these reasons are due to economic hardship, and a small part is due to the cannibalistic nature of the old ethics. The inability of illegitimate children to be accepted by society is a clear example of the ethics eating people. As for those who are safely born but are still drowned or abandoned, the records in the newspapers alone are too numerous to count. The reasons for this, of course, are also nothing more than the two mentioned above. In addition, those who are lucky enough not to be killed or abandoned are simply left to their fate, left to live or die on their own! Therefore, the mortality rate of Chinese children is higher than in any other country. According to statistics, approximately 250 out of every 1,000 infants die each year, and the actual number may be even higher. This is the general situation regarding "upbringing." Next, let's talk about "education."</p>
<p>"Education"? Of course, there are kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools everywhere now, and the problem of children's education seems to be no problem. However, on the other hand, we can see that rural children follow their parents, moving and wandering; workers' young children are thrown in corners and under eaves, groping alone; orphans and abandoned girls wander and drift everywhere. In addition, a large number of child laborers in factories are doing labor that hinders their physical and mental development, like apprentices who are essentially slaves, living a life of whipping and scolding all day long. They have no opportunity or blessing to receive education. All they have is the merciless whipping and the harm from machines. Compulsory education, which has been talked about for decades, is still just empty talk. In total, there are no less than 40 million out-of-school children nationwide. On the eve of celebrating Children's Day, some children will indeed be happy and fortunate enough to participate in the festivities, but the vast majority are spending this cold spring season wandering, struggling, and suffering. It is hoped that these issues will be given special attention during the upcoming Children's Year campaign.</p>
<p>In fact, the problem of children, just like the problem of women, is also one of the social problems. In the current state where the social system has not yet been rationalized, empty talk about children's happiness is just drawing cakes to satisfy hunger, or only a few lucky children will receive these benefits. It is simply irrelevant to the majority of children. However, the rationalization of the social system is not something that can be accomplished overnight. Therefore, before the social system has been rationalized, in addition to striving to find ways to make it rational, we hope to make every effort to establish more labor nurseries in cities, more nurseries during busy farming seasons in rural areas, vigorously promote education, and establish more people's hospitals. These may be more practical than empty talk about lectures and entertainment events that sing "happiness" and "love."</p>
<h3>The Myriad Difficulties Before Wei Ming</h3>
<p>— Ning Fu</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw in the newspaper a meaningful elegy written by a certain lady lamenting the suicide of the movie star Ruan Lingyu. The original text seemed to be: "Before Wei Ming, there were still myriad difficulties; After Ai Xia, now another one." In fact, I think that instead of using these two cautionary lines to mourn Ms. Ruan Lingyu's suicide, it would be better to add some supplements to them to warn the vast number of suffering women in this era. The supplement I am talking about is: 1. The women facing myriad difficulties now are not only the "Wei Ming type" intellectual class; 2. If the broad mass of oppressed women do not have the determination to face and resist these growing myriad difficulties, then the women who commit suicide after Wei Ming will certainly be more than just Ms. Ruan Lingyu.</p>
<p>What truly exists before our eyes is an era of myriad difficulties. In social life, on the one hand, there is foreign aggression, and on the other hand, there is famine and war. People who were able to barely struggle above the starvation line a year or two ago have now been ruthlessly driven onto the dead end of death. In spiritual life, the cultural dominance that runs parallel to imperialist guns and economics is firmly combined with the native feudal forces, and a retrograde restoration movement is fiercely underway. "Chaste women sacrificing themselves for their husbands, filial daughters seeking their fathers"—all the "deeds and beautiful tales" of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have been reproduced one by one in the 1930s China. The external economic suffering and the internal spiritual torment—the tragic experiences of Wei Ming, the protagonist of "New Woman," can be said to be a shared experience of middle-class intellectual women in China today when viewed from a certain perspective.</p>
<p>The anti-feudal movement advocated by the petty bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeois intellectuals in the May Fourth era, like the processes left behind by all other cultural departments, saw the leaders fail to defeat the main force of the enemy and abandon their historical mission. On the other hand, the later generations who should have shouldered this historical mission were limited to a culturally powerless, unorganized form due to the economic reasons of a semi-colonial society. Thus, in this great but suffering process, the broad mass of Chinese women were cruelly driven onto a battlefield where they had to fight two powerful enemies at the same time. That is to say, on one hand, they were fighting the social mechanism for survival, and on the other hand, they were fighting for humanity against all the male-centered concepts.</p>
<p>Some people say that the film "New Woman" depicts three typical modern Chinese women, but in my opinion, it would be better to say that this is only a method of expression adopted by the playwright for the convenience of explanation. The two personalities of Wang Moqiu and Ruan Lingyu in the play exist contradictorily and confusedly in all Chinese and intellectual women, and the general empty individuality expressed in the play is now being nurtured inside the factories made of red bricks and steel! Of course, the whip of life and the spirit of striving for life can reduce the unique sadness of intellectuals and the torment of so-called "spiritual tragedy," but when we further come into contact with reality, we will be shocked by the greatness of the feudal forces that firmly dominate the minds and concepts of all female producers for thousands of years!</p>
<p>For the sake of the personality and survival of millions of oppressed women, all progressive intellectual women should bravely shoulder the unfinished mission of the previous women's movement. Slavish complacency and religious fantasies are no longer the resting place for conscious women, and the clouds of nihilism and decadence can no longer block the conscious women's outlook on the future. So let us boldly gaze at reality, frankly recognize ourselves, and for the sake of saving ourselves and saving millions of our sisters, stand together with people with the same fate, overcome all difficulties, and launch another new attack against feudalism and ethical norms.</p>

<h3>Third: From Matriarchy to Patriarchy</h3>
<p>— Jun Ci</p>
<p>The establishment and decline of a system are bound to have socio-economic causes. In other words, under certain socio-economic conditions, a certain system that adapts to it will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>How did the matriarchal system collapse, and how did the patriarchal system come into being? This question has been touched upon briefly in the previous section, but I think it would still be worthwhile to further explore this issue.</p>
<p>First, the conditions for the survival of the original matriarchal system can be divided into the following three types:</p>
<p>First, in primitive societies, men were mostly engaged in warfare, and the production of essential materials for the survival of society was entirely borne by women. Therefore, women occupied an important position in production labor. They not only supported themselves but also had to raise children, so they had to work hard to produce. Gathering grass roots and tree fruits, and catching small animals and bird eggs were their regular production activities. In this production behavior, they invented agriculture and animal husbandry. As a result, production greatly increased, and women's economic status was further elevated.</p>
<p>Second, the form of sexual union among primitive humans was mostly group marriage. Children only knew their mothers and not their fathers. Therefore, mothers occupied an important position in the family, and matrilineal clans arose. Men who married wives had to join their wives' clans. As a result, women completely controlled the right to choose their partners.</p>
<p>Third, clan property such as land, produce, and other production tools were originally owned in common by the entire clan. However, the management and distribution rights belonged to older women, and only women were of the same bloodline. Therefore, inheritance rights were also limited to women.</p>
<p>Even so, the matriarchal system did not mean female autocracy or oppression of men. The superior status of women here was the right of sexual choice that women should have for the sake of species reproduction, rather than an absolute relationship of subordination between men and women. In matriarchal society, there was common production and common consumption. The interests of the individual and the interests of society were consistent. There was neither anyone who obtained without labor nor anyone who labored without obtaining.</p>
<p>However, this system was eventually collapsed. The reasons for this collapse can be divided into the following two points:</p>
<p>First, with the invention of new means of production, agriculture and animal husbandry developed rapidly, requiring a large amount of labor. Because the more labor there was, the greater the production would be, men captured foreign tribes from wars as slaves to make them work in production. In this way, men changed from commanders of war to guides of production, and thus leapt to occupy an important economic position.</p>
<p>Second, the clan's population increased and split into multiple clans. Marriage between different clans became impossible, so the group marriage system was changed to dual marriage, that is, certain men and women cohabited, and the children born were their own. In this way, many small families arose within the clan, and the interests of the small families and the entire clan could not be consistent. As a result, the matriarchal clan fell into a state of disintegration.</p>
<p>In this way, the matriarchal clan was collapsed, and the status and power of women quickly declined. Patriarchy arose to replace it.</p>
<p>So, what role did the patriarchal system play in society? Its first characteristic was the private ownership of property. After the disintegration of the matriarchal community, all means of production were occupied by older men, that is, commanders in wartime. At the same time, due to the labor of the slave system, production greatly increased. Surplus production occurred within the clan, and this surplus part also became the property of the clan chief, resulting in haves and have-nots.</p>
<p>The second characteristic was the class system. After slave labor began, two types of people emerged: those who commanded labor and those who directly performed labor. Thus, masters and slaves, nobles and commoners, arose.</p>
<p>The third characteristic was the marriage system. Men used their superior economic position to seize women's right to choose their partners. Women who married men became men's tools for sexual gratification.</p>
<p>The fourth characteristic was the polygamy system. In addition to plundering women from foreign tribes as wives and concubines, men could buy women to use as playthings as long as they had assets.</p>
<p>The fifth characteristic was the demand for women's chastity. Sexual desire was originally as natural as other emotions, but for the sake of ensuring legitimate offspring and inheritance of property, men absolutely encouraged women's sexual exclusivity.</p>
<p>The sixth characteristic was the small family system. The private property system took individual private ownership as the economic unit. Therefore, small families centered on individuals arose. Wives and children were the property of the husband and father, who had absolute disposal rights.</p>
<p>This irrational patriarchal system has lasted for thousands of years, degrading women physically and mentally to the lowest non-human state!</p>
<p>Finally, from the above, we can see the following two points:</p>
<p>First, the patriarchal system is based on private ownership of property, while the matriarchal system is based on common ownership of property.</p>
<p>Second, patriarchal society is class-based, while matriarchal society is classless.</p>
<h3>Health Beauty and Posture Beauty</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>Everyone likes beautiful looks, but there are too few natural beauties, and training can make up for deficiencies.</p>
<p>In ancient China, the beauty of women was mostly evaluated based on their faces, and it was thought that those with beautiful faces were beauties, and nothing else mattered.</p>
<p>Of course, a beautiful face is the main condition for a woman's beauty, but only taking the face into account and ignoring other aspects is no longer the evaluation standard for modern beauties.</p>
<p>The qualifications of modern beauties should be considered as a whole. Face, posture, health, and spirit must all be present for her to be called a true beauty. Lacking one or two of these, her qualifications are flawed, and whether she is a beauty becomes difficult to determine.</p>
<p>If a woman with a beautiful face is thin, weak, and full of sickness, can she be called a qualified beauty? No! She lacks health. Without a healthy body, she lacks vividness, freshness, and lovable charm.</p>
<p>If she has a beautiful face and a healthy body, but her posture is deformed, with a hunched back, uneven shoulders, a short neck, short legs, or a thick waist, lacking curves in her hips, or even stiff and rigid, and walks awkwardly, can she be said to be a qualified beauty? No! Her posture has problems. A problem with posture is sometimes more unsightly than being born without beauty.</p>
<p>If a woman's face is not particularly beautiful, but her figure is very beautiful, as long as she is willing to work hard and train to make her body healthy, lively, graceful, upright, and spirited, then she can definitely be called a beauty. Because she has the assistance of training, the health beauty and posture beauty that come from training are beauty methods that can rival nature's craftsmanship. Add to that her natural posture, and posture is a major condition for beauty!</p>
<p>Health beauty and posture beauty can not only transform a person's appearance and make up for natural deficiencies, but also enable a healthy body to do many things. Westerners say: A sound body has a sound mind. Great undertakings rely on a sound mind to accomplish them. Furthermore, a person whose spirit is sound and whose appearance is handsome and noble will never engage in vulgar or disreputable deeds, thereby cultivating their own noble character. Such is the efficacy of health beauty and posture beauty!</p>
<p>In order to cultivate excellent citizens, how should we actively pay attention to this issue?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Chinese people do not pay enough attention to health. From officials and the wealthy to prisons and factories, everything is unsanitary. People do not exercise, allowing their bodies to become weak, lacking perseverance and industrious habits. Few people pay attention to whether their posture is good or not. High moral standards and elegant manners seem to be nonexistent in the minds of many people today.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are many people who are as weak as worms, shaped like turtles, and willing to do anything base and despicable. It is heartbreaking to see the nation decline!</p>
<p>Since the promotion of bodybuilding, women have also begun to pay attention to physical education. The "mermaid" has gained a lot of attention, and there is also a trend of showing bare legs and arms, and wearing tight-fitting clothing, distorting health beauty and posture beauty into showing off and sensuality. Good things always turn bad when they come to China!</p>
<p>I often see some modern women on the street who seem to have health beauty and posture beauty. They also put on a show of raising their heads, sticking out their chests, and exuding energy, walking with their high heels clicking rhythmically, making people envious. But what is their substance? Are they truly healthy? How many are not relying on makeup to beautify their faces, and not relying on delicate affectation to create an imposing appearance?</p>
<p>Of course, I do not deny that there are truly healthy and outstanding individuals among them. But they are very few.</p>
<p>There are also many women, whether their faces are beautiful or ordinary, whose bodies are very fragile and have no energy at all. They drag their feet when they walk, as if life is a heavy burden that crushes their vitality. Content with a wretched existence, a sense of resignation is revealed in their actions and demeanor. Some hang their heads and hunch their backs, lifeless like ghosts, while others shrug their shoulders, tilt their necks, and clumsily sway from side to side, making them unsightly.</p>
<p>This phenomenon demonstrates the decline of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>There is simply no talk of feminine beauty here!</p>
<p>This weakness of women: on a small scale, it harms their own health, loses their beauty, and kills their dignity and vitality; on a large scale, it disgraces the nation and creates weak and useless citizens who live and die wretchedly, waiting to become slaves of a conquered nation. The terror of national peril!</p>
<p>Health is beauty, is happiness; posture beauty is very spectacular. Beauty and happiness and spectacular scenery, that should be every girl's hope. Except for the most unfortunate in special reasons limited, can not get health, ordinary women should try to pursue this hope</p>
<p>Posture beauty and health beauty are closely related, except for the natural slender beauty, other such as humped back, uneven shoulders, bowed head, clumsy, can not let go of the pace, can be from the gymnastics training to correct. Gymnastics can make the body healthy, but also make the posture correct and more elegant. As for the elegance of demeanor, chic, graceful, handsome, upright, vigorous, noble, that is because of the different personality of each person, can not be forced to be the same.</p>
<p>In short, we want every woman to have health beauty, posture beauty, whether born or acquired, at least to be correct posture, to raise their heads, chest to walk, the pace to be let go, walk fast. If you can go to bed early and get up early, pay attention to hygiene, and practice their own posture better.</p>
<p>I have a friend who is the most sick because of congenital and acquired special circumstances. Someone asked her: You are so sick, and sick so fierce, coupled with poor, why not dead? She said: I usually do three hundred movements every morning or even five hundred movements, and do forty or fifty movements before going to bed. My lungs do at least twenty deep breaths every day, and I pay attention to hygiene. When I get seriously ill, I calm down and do not get dry at all. In this way, how can I die? I think this is a poem of gymnastics to save lives.</p>
<p>As this international tide ravages China, our country's women have fallen into the siege of suffering, we must emphasize the desire to survive, exercise their physical strength and wisdom, with the power of unity, break through this siege, and begin a new upward outlook. Therefore, I hope that all the men and women, old and young, in China will advocate health beauty, posture beauty, in order to cultivate strong and excellent citizens, to answer this surging tide! Only health beauty can break China's weakness, so that the race can be eugenic; only posture beauty can sweep away the ugliness of complacency and degeneration, and achieve the outstanding effect of the nation!</p>
<h3>Diary of a Concubine (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>March 22nd</p>
<p>Elder × has been acting a bit strangely towards me these past few days. When I hand him his clothes in the morning, he always ignores me. It's only when he comes back drunk at night that he has any energy. During the day, the way he acts, you'd think we weren't sleeping together at all. If you ask him anything, he always says, "You women don't understand. Women only know how to dress and eat."</p>
<p>Ah! Who says women dress up nicely if not for their husbands? He doesn't come home to sleep for two nights, always wearing perfume and alcohol on his body as if he's letting the fragrance down. I feel a bit bored applying lipstick and powder. No wonder old women don't like to dress up. If old women could find a wealthy man, even if powder didn't look good on them, they would certainly love perfume. The old woman scolds young people for liking to dress up, and it's entirely out of jealousy.</p>
<p>People are always afraid of getting old. I don't know why, but when I look in the mirror every day, sometimes I feel very young, and sometimes I feel like wrinkles have started to appear on my face. I remember a saying, "When pearls turn yellow and people get old, they're worthless." Yes, if women had money of their own, who would want to marry a man with a beard! I've been involved with three young men in my life, but they couldn't afford my ransom! Although Elder × is old, he can pay the money. He got a bargain. In a few more years, he'll嫌me for being old! Then he won't be willing to spend money on me anymore.</p>
<p>The mirror is probably what young girls like the most. I'm gradually... but I don't want to hate it so quickly!</p>
<p>March 25th</p>
<p>The temper Elder × threw this morning was really strange. How could I be having an affair with Secretary Li's brother! These past few days, he's been saying that the ministry is busy and he can't be home. The old lady's condition is getting worse, and he won't let me go out, telling me to stay home and listen for his calls. But he can't keep me locked up all day! Little Li and Secretary Li's wife came over together, and what's wrong with me playing two rounds of mahjong with them! I feel that today's anger is a bit upsetting. But there's no way around it, being a woman! It's okay for men to play with girls. He wouldn't have married me if he didn't play with girls. I've even seen his wife!</p>
<p>He also said that my hair is permed differently, and I don't know who I'm planning to seduce! But it's actually because he said last time that it didn't look good when it was worn down, so I changed it to this.</p>
<p>When he gets angry, he starts investigating my monthly expenses. I haven't played mahjong for fifty dollars these past few months. Before I got married, as long as business was good, it was worth spending a few more dollars without suffering this kind of anger. Actually, getting married is still the same as doing business, the same as sleeping and getting money. It's just that, in name, I'm not being prostituted anymore.</p>
<p>March 29th</p>
<p>Elder × scolded me the day before yesterday. Seeing that I didn't say a word, he realized he was too imposing. Yesterday, he brought me a diamond ring when he came back from Secretary Li's place. It is said that the ring originally belonged to the third concubine of Bank Manager Zhao. Because she lost at jai alai last year and hid it from the bank manager, she asked Secretary Li to pawn it. Now that she herself is dead, the pawnbroker has asked Secretary Li to sell it cheaply.</p>
<p>This ring is indeed very good, pure foreign craftsmanship. It is said that the original price could be worth more than six hundred taels, but Elder × bought it for only four hundred dollars. According to Aunt Yang, it's not even worth four hundred dollars, only two hundred and seventy dollars. Elder × deliberately inflated the price to me!</p>
<p>I've loved diamonds since I was a child. I think everyone likes these things, they're so bright and so light. But their disadvantage is that they can't reflect people.</p>
<p>Spring is here, and the wind is still howling! The flower racks in the courtyard are all shaking. The gardener will be busy again tomorrow.</p>
<p>I plan to go to sleep and not wait for him. It's simply too boring to sit still. I don't know when he'll be back. It's already twelve o'clock!</p>
<p>March 31st</p>
<p>Yesterday was Miss Lian's grandfather, Sun Lao Taiye's, eightieth birthday. It was really lively. They put on a play, and the wine alone cost more than a thousand taels of silver. Naturally, his sons and sons-in-law are all officials. Isn't Lao Taiye's birthday a big deal? Like when Wang the chef's father had his birthday last time, that was only because his son was a senior clerk, so he took two bowls of chicken soup noodles from our kitchen. I heard that his old woman raised chickens in the countryside all her life and never even had a bowl of chicken soup noodles herself!</p>
<p>I heard that my mom hasn't had chicken soup noodles either. Alas, she's dead now, otherwise… No matter whether her daughter is married off or sold off, if her daughter has a diamond ring to wear, Mom always…</p>
<p>Really, mentioning the diamond ring reminds me of the visit to the Sun family yesterday to offer birthday wishes: there were quite a few female guests wearing diamond rings, but compared to mine, mine was much better, so bright, and set so delicately; the ring was bright, making my whole body bright, as if my face was glowing. But later, when I was watching the play, when the man in the suit behind me stared at me, I felt embarrassed instead. Why were his eyes so vicious? Was it jealousy, or contempt? His vicious gaze was like it was full of thorns, piercing from my heart all the way to my face. Instantly I felt that my glowing face became red: what exactly was the reason he was looking at me like that? Could it be that he knew that I was often scolded at home, and that this ring was given to me by the person who scolded me! Since I'm so spineless, why did I accept this ring from the person who scolds me! I'm afraid he's not just thinking about the scolding, he knows many other things about me!</p>
<p>I'm afraid he doesn't just think this way about me alone. He must know many things about women who wear their husbands' diamond rings. But it's best if he doesn't know. If he knew, the ring wouldn't make people glow like that.</p>
<p>Another fit of anger this afternoon!</p>
<p>April 5th</p>
<p>It's been raining these past few days, and the gloomy weather is ruining people's moods. Especially for someone like me, who is suffering anger and living a dark life!</p>
<p>Today, because I asked someone to clean the living room, the servant was careless and broke the vase that Secretary Li gave me. Elder × came back and immediately flew into a rage, scolding me as a beast, a rice bucket, and even scolding me as a prostitute, a cheap bone, why didn't I tell the servant to be careful! How would I know why? What could I do if I told him and he was still careless?</p>
<p>He slapped the servant and chased him away. Servants can run away, they can quit and go to the employment agency! Me, I can't be scolded away, I can be vented on as much as possible. I can't go to another family from here. Moreover, I'm pregnant now. No wonder he didn't allow me to have an abortion last time. A small child can lock up a woman's heart. When a woman is locked up, men can do whatever they want outside without worry. Anyway, wealthy men might as well lock up a few more women at home. In the past, you had to be an emperor to have three palaces and six courtyards, but now any wealthy man can imitate the emperor!</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am a weak girl who is not yet fourteen years old, and I am currently studying at the elementary school in our village. My family owns a hundred acres of thin land, and I have a grandmother and three aunts who are all married. My father is an only son—sickly, (my father is fifty-two years old now,) and he has taken two wives. The first wife had no children. My mother only gave birth to me, and I have no brothers or sisters, alas! Because I am in this harsh and secluded village, who would take a weak girl like me seriously? Especially the evil customs in the countryside, if a family has no sons, (having daughters doesn't count) then the inheritance must be taken over by nephews from the near branch. My grandmother has this kind of thinking. Because my father has no sons, the family property will be inherited by others anyway, so she tries her best to help my aunt's family, therefore there are often quarrels in the family. Fortunately, although my father is melancholy and sickly, his mind is very clear, so he told me to enter school to study, and I am also very happy to study, and I plan to study to at least graduate from high school. Alas! What I fear is that my father's winter-sick body will make it difficult to fulfill my wishes—. As I write this, I can't help but burst into tears. Compassionate sir! Please close your eyes and think, if my father happens to die, my grandmother probably won't be in charge, and my mother is an old-fashioned woman. How can I, a fourteen-year-old girl, deal with a group of wolves like people? How can I talk about going to high school? Sir, if you read this life story of mine, you will understand my hidden pain! What I am now asking the teacher to answer is: Can we women really inherit the property? If the near relatives use force to inherit the property, what should I do?</p>
<p>In addition, after I graduate, what school should I enter? Please also tell me, sir. Yu Xian Hu Hou</p>
<p>(Answer) The current law already allows women to have the right to inherit property. When the inheritance begins in the future, your father's estate should be inherited by your mother and you. Also, the current law has abolished ancestral inheritance. If your parents do not want to adopt an adopted son, the clansmen must not force the inheritance! If the clansmen adhere to the old customs and force the inheritance! Legal remedies can be sought. If your parents are willing to adopt an adopted son, the adopted son's property inheritance share in the future is one-half of your property inheritance share. (Answered by lawyer Pu Shunqing)</p>
<p>Ms. Yu Xian:</p>
<p>The legal part of your letter has been answered by lawyer Pu Shunqing as above. As for your further education, I think that after graduating from elementary school, of course, you should only enter high school to seek basic knowledge. As for which high school is good, I hope you will inquire nearby. See you again and wish you hard work. Editor</p>
<h3>Posing Problems and Solving Problems</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhi</p>
<p>Human life can be said to be completely immersed in problems. The individual, society, and even the entire history of humanity, all take the posing and solving of problems as their process of development. For example, in the long historical evolution of mankind, in terms of nature, questions such as why objects fall, why they have hot and cold, what light and electricity are, and where the earth and the sun come from have been constantly raised, and answers such as gravity causes objects to fall, molecular vibration generates heat, light and electricity are ether waves, etc., have been made, thus forming the scientific development process of human understanding of nature. In terms of society, in ancient societies, the issue of gender struggle was raised, followed by the issue of slavery, and in modern times, the issue of labor; and the process of posing and subsequently solving general marriage issues, social systems of various eras, political laws, production and its distribution, exchange, management, etc., has become the development history of all social life. In the flow of individual life? From youth, there are the questions of schooling and marriage; and in adulthood, there are the daily problems of clothing, food, and housing in private life, and career problems harassing you; in social life, there are also questions of how to participate in social activities, what responsibilities should be fulfilled to it, and what should be sought from it, and the posing and continuous solving of these problems is the history of individual life. Thus, it is not an exaggeration for me to say that the individual, society, and their history all take posing and solving problems as their process.</p>
<p>But how are all problems posed, and how are they solved? Here, there are two distinctly opposing schools of thought offering their own different answers. Some people believe that the posing of all problems is entirely based on the development of human subjective mental wisdom. For example, the process of understanding nature is the result required by the pure impulse of the desire for knowledge, that is, simply because humans subjectively arbitrarily raise questions and pursue answers, they pose questions about natural science and philosophy. Regarding society, it is because great historical figures and scholars subjectively and arbitrarily feel dissatisfied with existing lifestyles, social systems, laws, social customs, habits, etc., that they freely pursue new lives, yearn for new societies, raise new problems and demand solutions to these problems. As for the solution of all problems? It is the same. In the view of this school of thought, the progress of understanding in natural science and philosophy, and the correct answers to many problems, are freely invented by scholars, great scientists, and thinkers, so the progress of natural science is generally attributed to the genius creation of great scientists. In the evolution of social life, they attribute the reform of systems and laws, and the changes in thought, entirely to the genius of great people, believing that when they come up with good systems and methods, society will improve and progress according to their designs. In a word, the progress of humanity is guided by thought, history is created by great people, and the free spirit dominates the world, leading society and history forward. This school of thought is usually called the idealist point of view.</p>
<p>Directly opposed to this view is the objective historical philosophical point of view. In the view of this school of thought, the posing and solving of problems, whether in the natural world or in society, are not free creations of individual subjective thought, but inevitably occur due to the development of social production to a certain level. The posing of the problem of Yiqin'e requires that the social conditions of production have developed to the point where those problems can be posed, or even that those problems already exist there, before the problem will arise. As for the methods and conditions for its solution, they also exist within the conditions of production. People themselves cannot pose problems from a purely subjective point of view, nor can they freely come up with solutions and effectively make the problem be solved. The occurrence of problems in thought and the ability to obtain solutions are objective reflections, and even require that those problems have reached the possibility of occurrence and solution before people can consider them and solve them. For example, in natural science, the question of whether heat is a substance or a form of energy and movement, and whether energy can be converted, would not have led people to doubt the caloric theory or propose the hypothesis that heat is one of the forms of energy and movement and that energy can be converted before production technology had developed to the point of the invention of the steam engine and the movement of heat engines. Of course, it would have been even more impossible at that time to answer this question and empirically prove that heat is a form of movement and that all forms of energy are mutually convertible. In society, if modern production had not yet developed, and there was no need for free buying and selling of labor, or for free operation of industry and commerce, then there would have been no dissatisfaction with the ancient slave system and autocracy, and no pursuit of the modern wage system and democracy, and no use of these as solutions, and no actual reform of the old society according to these ideals. In short, in the view of this school of thought, it is society itself that raises problems, and it is society itself that comes up with ways to create opportunities, and people are merely adding force to push it forward; it is not human thought that guides society, poses problems for it, and solves problems for it, but rather society that determines human thought, presents people with problems, and causes them to solve problems according to society's stipulations.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the posing and solving of problems, because it does not belong to the subjective affairs of mankind, but rather is social, so on the one hand, problems can only arise and be solved in the dynamic development process of society, and on the other hand, human practice is also necessary for problems to arise and be solved. For example, the change in the understanding of heat that we mentioned above, not only was the questioning of the caloric theory and the posing of the question of the pursuit of the essence of heat the result of the development and change of production, but the correct understanding of the essence of heat, the laws of thermodynamics, was also the result of production advancing to a certain stage, and it was also a problem that humans encountered in the practice of labor, and it was also when the continued development of production was hindered that a problem arose, at which time human power could be used to promote its progress, and the problem could then be solved. If mankind had not promoted the practical activities of history, and history had remained stagnant and undeveloped, then there would have been no social problems at all, and of course, problems could not be solved.</p>
<p>The occurrence and solution of problems are the result of the contradictory effects of movement and development, and the occurrence and solution of problems also creates contradictions. Because the existing reality must be unable to adapt to the new developments in motion, problems arise, and the solution of a problem is a kind of rebellion or cancellation of the existing reality, that is, negation. Thus, both of these are the result of contradictions, which is very clear. And because problems arise in contradictions, the establishment of a problem is the existence of a contradiction, and although the solution of a problem seems to overcome the contradiction, because history is still moving forward, it creates new contradictions in this solution, so the posing and solving of problems is the establishment of contradictions and the creation of contradictions. According to this, then, what is the purpose of mankind in posing and solving these problems? Regarding this point, not only is it objective and we cannot get rid of it, but contradiction is the key to progress, and a problem that is raised and then solved creates social progress. To want to live in a world without contradictions is to say to live in a static, unprogressive state, which cannot solve problems. The posing and solving of problems is an element of human progress, so anyone who wants to live in life and society without problems and live peacefully is not only a decadent thought that does not seek progress, but also a fantasy, and objectively it does not allow us to do so.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Village Silk Artisan</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>My hometown is a certain province where the silk industry is widespread. However, my family had no mulberry fields, only two vegetable plots as big as buttocks, and no spacious silkworm rearing rooms, only three pigeon-coop-like thatched huts, so my family did not have a "silk industry". However, the livelihood of the whole family still depended on "silk": my father helped others carry mulberry leaves, and my mother reeled silk for others (commonly known as "extracting silk")—she was a famous female silk artisan, and the spring cocoons and summer cocoons (commonly known as "foreign cocoons") of the major silkworm farmers in the vicinity were mostly spun into yellow and white silk by her. My mother always liked to take me with her when she went out to extract silk for others: at first, I just wanted to get a couple of bowls of rice, and then I became her assistant. Under this family tradition, it was easy for me to become a "little silk artisan": at the age of seven or eight, I could identify the color of the fire for boiling cocoons, and I was also 100% accurate in "picking up the head".</p>
<p>That was during the Republic of China in the years 1919 and 1920 when raw silk was selling at a high price, and families with fields were rushing to plant mulberries to prepare for raising silkworms, and those with existing mulberry fields were hatching large numbers of silkworm eggs. This was the golden age of the "female silk artisan": this family invited her over, and that family invited her over, and every time the spring cocoons "came down from the tree" (i.e., came down from the cocooning frames), she was busy until "mixing the bucket and going down to the field" (harvesting the shells). When others saw that my mother was too busy, they always loved to stroke my head and say: "The little silk artisan is growing up fast, and when he grows up, he can go out alone!" When my mother heard this, she immediately added a smile to her tired face and said, "Soon, soon, when he can step on the silk reeling machine, he will go out!" Indeed, my mother often said to me in private, "Child, as long as you can step on the silk reeling machine. You see, my craftsmanship is so good, but I'm the only one reeling silk, and your father is like a stupid pig, and he can't learn it no matter how much I teach him. It's such a pity to see the money not being earned!"—Actually, the "money" was not much: two hundred coins for one tael of silk. If the cocoons were good (the location of the silkworm rearing frames in the countryside was often not very particular, often one side was dark and the other side was too bright, and the light was different, and one cocoon would be divided into thick and thin. At the same time, the cocoons were not killed properly at the appropriate temperature, and most of them produced moths or maggots when they were reeled. All of these hindered the reeling of silk.), she could reel eight taels a day from five o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night, and the wages were calculated at one string and six hundred coins. At that time, the price of silver was about three strings, and she only earned more than five jiao a day, but in my mother's eyes, this number was a remarkable figure. You should know that at that time, the general labor force was very cheap, and if you helped people farm, the wages for a male worker were three hundred coins. My mother's daily earnings were five times more than a man's, which was something to be very excited about!</p>
<p>My mother earned a lot of money, but she also suffered a lot: she had to get up to boil the cocoons when the chicken crowed for the second time, and before it was light, the "rattling" sound of the silk reeling machine had penetrated the eardrums of the owners. The left hand scooped the cocoons, the right hand constantly "picked up the head", the right foot stepped on the "pedal", and the left foot pointed to the ground as the fulcrum of the whole body. The ears had to listen to the slow rotation of the wheel, and the eyes had to pay attention to the "dragon head" of the silk suction (native silk did not use a "magnetic eye", but only a copper wire circle to block the jumping cocoons, commonly known as the dragon head), it was really using all five senses, and the limbs could not rest, and she would "reel silk and reel silk again" until it was dark before she could stop working. In addition, the silk reeling machines in the countryside were very heavy, and it was very laborious to step on them, and every time she went to bed, she always complained of sore legs, aching back, and dizzy head. However, it was okay just to be tired, there was more suffering: the heat released from the silk pot rushed straight to the face, and in less than ten days, the face would be swollen, and the eyes would be red, and at the same time, both hands were soaked in the silk water all day long, and the seams between the fingers were inevitably corroded by the silk water, so every time during the "silk month", my mother's eyes would get sick, and both hands would be guarding the silk reeling machine all day long. You should know that my family had no land, and the life of a family of five (I also had a younger brother and a younger sister), in addition to my father's occasional odd jobs, mostly depended on my mother's silk reeling to maintain it!</p>
<p>Originally, my mother reeled silk for others, and the wages were based on the number of taels, and there was no limit to how much she reeled each day, but the silk reeling time in the countryside was only in May and June, and if she did not quickly reel more silk and earn more money in this short period of time, then there would be no opportunity to reel silk in the future, and there would be panic about the food for the year! In fact, my family's life was not fixed, and in the barren months (January, February, and March), we were always unable to make ends meet, but it was a little better during the prosperous silk industry years of the Republic of China in 1919 and 1920. My mother seemed very happy during these years, and although fatigue, pain, and illness were always缠绕ing her, there were often traces of smiles on her face, and at the same time, when she talked to my father, you could hear happy tones. She said: "The number of families raising silkworms is increasing day by day, and the price of silk is higher than in previous years. My craftsmanship seems to be better year by year—um! It's a pity that one hand can't catch a few flies. But, but wait two or three more years, and Jinsheng will be able to go out!" Yes, my mother felt that her craftsmanship would get better in the future, and I also hoped that it would get to the top. My mother hoped that I would "be able to step on the silk reeling machine" earlier, and I also wanted to grow up quickly so that I could go out to extract silk alone and help my mother earn money.</p>
<p>But the facts are always difficult to match the imagination: when I was able to step on the silk reeling machine, my mother's craftsmanship was not as prosperous as it had been in previous years. In fact, there were still many families raising silkworms, but most of them did not extract silk but sold raw cocoons. It is said that because the sales of native silk were blocked, it was not as straightforward and profitable as selling cocoons. At the same time, several new silk factories were established in the city, and they needed the cocoons from the surrounding villages to supply their silk reeling, and in this wave of the development of factory silk, the territory of native silk was plundered. Under the circumstances of this large-scale production of improved raw silk quality, our rural "female silk artisans" and "little silk artisans" suffered a terrible fate: in the "silk months" of previous years, my mother was so busy that she could not breathe, but now she was so idle that she was just fuming in the house, and although some people called for silk reeling, it was only for a day or two before the work was finished. Skilled female silk artisans were still so coldly treated, and no one took care of me, a little silk artisan who had just completed his apprenticeship! So my mother kept sighing, and I sighed along with her, but what was the use? Even if we sighed until our mouths were broken and our throats were hoarse, we still couldn't get a patron!</p>
<p>The panic of life forced my parents to think of a way out for me: my father planned to send me to learn tailoring, and my mother insisted on sending me to a silk factory as an apprentice. My father's reason was that tailoring was a craft that was not idle in any season. My mother felt that there was a great future in being an apprentice in a silk factory, and when I became a craftsman after completing my apprenticeship, I could receive wages and share dividends. My father couldn't argue with my mother after all, and as a result, I went into the "Xinglong Factory" and became a basic "apprentice", preparing to fulfill my mother's wish—"receiving wages" and "sharing dividends".</p>
<p>But fate seemed to be deliberately against me, and before I had completed my three-year apprenticeship, the Xinglong Factory was no longer "prosperous" and closed down! In the chaos of more than four hundred craftsmen and apprentices leaving the factory, I also returned to the countryside with a sad heart. When I got home and looked, my mother's old silk reeling machine had accumulated a thick layer of dust and was about to be burned as firewood!</p>
<p>Factory silk and native silk were both in decline, and my poor family that depended on "silk" for food was almost broken. The so-called "female silk artisans" and "little silk artisans" were all thrown out of the silk industry by the wheels!</p>
<p>Biography of Famous People</p>
<h3>The Life of Tolstoy</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>"Tolstoy," this great name, will almost coexist with the history of mankind. He was born in 1818 in Tula Province, Russia. He was a child from a noble family, the third child in the family. He lost his parents at the age of eight and was raised by relatives.</p>
<p>In 1843, he entered the University of Kazan, but he committed the same problem as a general genius: he refused to study hard and behaved in a dissolute manner, almost completely a typical unruly student. After four years, he requested to withdraw from school, and in the autumn of the same year, he re-entered the University of St. Petersburg to study, but in less than three months, he could not keep up. At this time, he spent his days gambling, hoping to join the cavalry of the guard to live. At this time, although he did not have much interest in schoolwork, he read a lot of other miscellaneous books, especially in countless works, he recognized Rousseau's theory and Jesus's sermon on the mount.</p>
<p>This can be said to be Tolstoy's early life, and it can also be said to be Tolstoy's dissolute period.</p>
<p>Later, his brother served as a artillery officer in the garrison in the Caucasus, and Tolstoy, under the pressure of depression and poverty, went to the Caucasus with his brother. The Caucasus has great and beautiful scenery, which gave him a little enlightenment of admiration for nature. After he joined the army, he did not have the opportunity to rise, and his relationship with the officers was not harmonious, and he felt very tired of his current life. Just when the Milim war began, he joined the front line and charged into battle, quite diligent, but after the war, the superior officers did not raise his position because of his merits, and he resolutely retired in anger.</p>
<p>At this time, he was extremely depressed, almost a very decadent person. In a life of boredom, he embarked on the path of literature, which was enough to comfort himself, and this was the beginning of Tolstoy's literary career.</p>
<p>Tolstoy was a very fond of touring people, and his footprints were often found in famous rivers and mountains. In his youth, he went abroad twice, and after returning to China, he returned to his hometown and lived with his aunt. Tolstoy's educational interests were very strong, and he was a believer of Rousseau, and he also advocated natural education. In 1859, he went abroad with his eldest brother to inspect the national education of various countries, and the following winter, his eldest brother died on the road, and the visit had to be suspended. He returned to China in May 1861 and served as a "justice of the peace", specializing in managing disputes between landlords and serfs. During his nearly one year in office, he resolved everything for them with a fair attitude, worked hard and complained, and exhausted his efforts. He felt the difficulty of this position and resigned on the grounds of illness. From then on, he devoted himself to education, running several schools in various places, and also running a magazine to discuss education issues. His educational philosophy is natural and free. He believes that nature is good, so we should return to nature, not be bound, and not be forced. This is quite in line with Rousseau's thought in Emile. But soon, the education career was interrupted due to illness, and Tolstoy left home to go to Samara.</p>
<p>He proposed to Miss Solia Beres in September 17, 1862. In the fifteen years after marriage, he enjoyed the peace of family, and with the help of his virtuous wife, his literary career had great achievements in these fifteen years. Solia</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>Miss Beres was almost Tolstoy's best secretary. It is said that Tolstoy's great work "War and Peace" went through seven revisions, and the work of Qing Teng was done by his wife alone. In 1869, Tolstoy delved into philosophy and was deeply influenced by Schopenhauer's pessimistic school. Later, he engaged in education, opened schools, compiled textbooks, and had to recuperate due to overwork. During this period, there was a great famine in Russia, so he devoted his energy to raising donations to provide relief, which aroused his interest in studying economic problems.</p>
<p>At this time, this literary master had many works published, and his position in the literary world can be said to have reached the peak, but his thinking suddenly changed at this time. He abandoned all his claims, all his ideals, and opposed all entertainment. He advocated a simple life, worshiped charitable education, and lived a hard life, and he completely became a humanitarian, a believer in Jesus. This sudden awakening of his is described in detail in his book "Confessions" in an autobiographical style. His scope of activity was standardized in religion, and he almost completely gave up the prospect of literature.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's abandonment of his literary career was his misfortune, and it was also the misfortune of the world literary world, and the world could not help but regret it. His close friend Turgenev, on his deathbed, also wrote a letter with heartfelt words, advising him to return to the literary world and engage in pen-and-ink life. Tolstoy, feeling the sincere advice of his friends and knowing that his creative desire was strong, was still able to write very powerful works at the advanced age of around sixty, and he was old and strong, which was enough to scare ordinary writers. Some people praised his literary thoughts as an inexhaustible gold mine, which is true!</p>
<p>Tolstoy's wife, Miss Solia Beres, was engaged to Tolstoy at the age of eighteen. After marriage, she not only gave Tolstoy endless spiritual comfort, but also gave indelible help in his career. However, geniuses are mostly not worthy of being good husbands, and their opinions are not consistent. After living together for ten years, gradually, each person's personality was exposed, and in his later years, he could not avoid the path of separation. After Tolstoy's thoughts changed and he gave his energy to religion, it was even more different from his wife's reality.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's later thoughts were very disgusted with the various corruptions of material civilization.</p>
<p>He was old, he hated women more and more, and he was also afraid of music. He himself had thirteen children, and he was a person with such a family position, and he still attacked the system of marriage and family, which was also an interesting thing in his life.</p>
<p>In his later years, he lived the most miserable life. On the one hand, his ideals were further away from him, and on the other hand, his thoughts made him an isolated person. He conflicted with his family, he conflicted with the world, and he often conflicted with himself. He often fell into contradictions, and the "miserable twilight" sent the world's great writer to the end of his life!</p>
<p>Tolstoy spent almost every day of his life in writing, and the most admirable thing is that he stopped his diary only four days before his death.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the morning on November 20, 1910, the generation of literary giant Tolstoy said goodbye to the world forever in Yasbo Floating. He died very peacefully. On the day of the funeral, countless people from all over the world went to the funeral, which shows how Tolstoy's spirit moved the world!</p>

<h3>A Gambling City in the South</h3>
<p>— Late Autumn</p>
<p>Dispatch from Kowloon</p>
<p>Gambling, in this area of Guangdong, has indeed become as commonplace as daily meals, forming one of the essential elements of life. Therefore, regardless of gender or age, people are invariably excited at the sight of gambling, eagerly participating with smiles on their faces. Thus, opportunities for gambling are virtually endless here. As long as you have money, you can find someone to gamble with anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Starting from the Kowloon Peninsula, a train ride on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway takes you to Bao'an County, Guangdong's famous gambling city. There, you can see many disillusioned politicians, officials, gentry, compradores, wealthy merchants, and aristocratic ladies, all displaying full energy and carrying huge sums of money to this "Monte Carlo" of the East to decide their fate.</p>
<p>There are over twenty gambling dens here in total. Each gambling den has several high sheds covered with palm leaves, connected together in a long line like a train. Surrounding the gambling dens are gardens full of exotic flowers and plants, Cantonese opera theaters that perform year-round, and painted boats for gamblers to enjoy on the lake. Material comforts are said to be available in every form.</p>
<p>The nature of these gambling dens can be simply described as disguised commercial capital exchange agencies. The capital of each gambling den is at least several hundred thousand to several million. They use such vast capital to run this kind of gambling business. People who don't understand the inner workings might laugh at their foolishness. In fact, after spending just three days in a gambling den, you will realize that the money earned from this "gambling industry" is richer than any other business.</p>
<p>In these many palm-leaf-covered gambling dens, there are "Fan-Tan," "Roulette," "Pai Gow," "Yao Tan," and all sorts of gambling tools. Gamblers can choose any gambling tool they like to gamble with the gambling den.</p>
<p>The gambling method of "Fan-Tan" involves piling many "xie zi" (small pieces), about the size of clothing buttons, on a rectangular table. The dealer grabs a handful and displays them publicly on the table, then covers them with a copper plate. The "tan guan" (dealer) rolls up his sleeves high, holds a delicate and smooth bamboo sliver about a foot long in his hand, and sits upright. On both sides of the table sit four "he guan" (croupiers) who are responsible for paying out and collecting money. Behind the "tan guan" sit two "wang qing" (observers), who specialize in paying attention to the amount of bets placed by the gamblers and where they are placed. If a dispute occurs, the "wang qing" will come down to resolve it. At least ten people are needed to distribute duties on such a table, each with a specific responsibility, and each doing their best to be loyal to their duty.</p>
<p>When a gambler walks up to this table, a young "greeter" in fashionable attire immediately comes over, wearing a smile and offering a towel, politely inviting the gambler to sit down. Then, a tea boy brings tea or soda and various snacks, arranging them on the table like offerings.</p>
<p>The "tan guan" grabs a handful of "liao zi" (pieces) and places them on the table. The "he guan" on both sides open their mouths and shout: "One! Good to bet!" "Hey! Three! Also good!" Shouting at the top of their lungs like door-to-door salespeople, looking at the face of every gambler. The "tan guan" displays a calm attitude, sizing up each gambler, his eyes as sharp as those of a hypnotist.</p>
<p>The faces of the gamblers change various colors according to their different mental states. Everyone's gaze is concentrated on the copper cover like electricity. Handfuls of red and green "chips" are sent to the middle of the table as casually as grabbing soybeans. The "he guan" stands up and counts the bets of the gamblers one by one. Then, ding ding ding... the bell rings, stopping the gamblers from placing bets. After the bell rings, the "tan guan" removes the copper cover and uses the bamboo sliver to count the "liao zi" four at a time, counting down to the last few. The number remaining is what is drawn. Odd numbers are "jin bao" (winning), and even numbers are "chu bao" (losing). The gamblers win or lose based on the number drawn and the established odds with the gambling den.</p>
<p>The betting rule is at least one yuan, and the more you bet, the more welcome you are. A one-yuan bet, if it's a single number, can win three yuan. Some bet one yuan on two or three numbers. If "two" is drawn, you can only win two yuan. If "three" is drawn, there is no win or loss.</p>
<p>Gambling "Pai Gow" is simpler. On one side of a rectangular table sit five people from the gambling den. The "zhuang jia" (banker) sits in the middle, with a "chi zhu" (bet taker) and a "pei zhuang" (banker payer) on either side, and two "wang qing" (observers) sitting high up, their four eyes shining like electric torches. The minimum bet for "Pai Gow" is one yuan. For five yuan or more, if the gambler wins, the "zhuang jia" takes a commission of ten cents. The more you bet, the heavier the commission.</p>
<p>The rules for playing "Pai Gow" here are very strict. Each side is represented by a gambler who takes the cards and lays them openly on the table. Gamblers have the right to participate in how the four cards are arranged. Sometimes, when encountering difficult problems, the "zhuang jia" can also offer advice. Because there are certain rules for arranging cards here, the "zhuang jia" will not change his fixed opinion even if he sees how the gambler arranges the cards. Therefore, the guests playing "Pai Gow" here are much livelier than those in other gambling departments.</p>
<p>However, those who gamble on roulette are mostly from the aristocratic class. The wins and losses in one night are often in the tens of thousands of yuan. Sometimes, wins and losses of more than a hundred thousand are also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The roulette gambling tool is a disc larger than a phonograph, spinning rapidly like a wheel. Inside the disc are thirty-eight slots, each with a number, from one to thirty-six, plus two slots, double circle and single circle. The roulette wheel consists of these thirty-eight numbers. The minimum bet is one yuan per number, but betting such a small amount is rare. The wins and losses in this type of gambling are tens of times higher than in all other forms of gambling here. If one yuan hits a number, there is hope of winning thirty-six yuan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the banker presses an electric bell, and the spirits of the gamblers in the audience suddenly tense up. One by one, the colored "chips" are placed in the squares marked with red and black numbers. After the guests have placed their "chips," the banker spins a smooth ball into the wheel with a whoosh. Then, the hissing sound resonates with the heartstrings of every gambler. Finally, with a clatter, the ball lands in a slot. Many gamblers simultaneously prick up their ears, listening to the number reported by the "he guan." Then, a burst of laughter and sighs fills the surroundings of the palm-leaf shed.</p>
<p>This type of gambling with odds of one to thirty-six attracts ordinary gamblers to become addicted to this game even if they lose their fortunes. Because in this type of gambling, winning thirty or forty thousand is extremely easy and commonplace, but losing a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand in one night can also be done in an instant. However, the results of general gamblers' bets are mostly in favor of the gambling den. The reason is that a gambling den's daily expenses of more than three thousand yuan have to be supplied by these extravagant gamblers.</p>
<p>The organization of these gambling dens is almost more complete than that of legitimate commercial institutions. They have the spirit of a bank here, but not the form of a bank. Gamblers have to buy tickets to enter the gambling den; some cost ten yuan or fifty yuan, depending on the size of the gambling den. When a gambler walks in, he takes ten yuan or fifty yuan to the counter and exchanges it for a "token." Gamblers can take this token inside and bet as they please. Regardless of winning or losing, after gambling once, they can exchange the token back for cash at that table. This is a method used by gambling dens to prevent people without money from entering and causing trouble. However, the greeters recognize gamblers who have been there more than three times very clearly. In the future, not only will they not have to buy tickets to enter, but the gambling dens will also pay for their transportation.</p>
<p>There is also a way to lure gamblers that is simply unbelievably clever. For example, when a gambler runs out of money, the gambling den has plenty of "pawn shops" where guests can take anything they own to pawn. However, the cost of pawning is often less than one-third of what pawn shops outside pay, and the interest is especially high. If the guest wins after pawning the capital and goes back to redeem it, the interest paid at that time will be doubled. If they lose, when you come to redeem it tomorrow, you will inevitably have to gamble again. This is still a way to lure male gamblers. For female gamblers, it is even more ingenious. When they are desperate, pawning things is a natural phenomenon. There is an even further step, which is that some women with weak wills inevitably sell their bodies in the gambling den when they have no other options. The gambling den has many exquisite rooms prepared specifically for these female gamblers to make a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>In short, the gambling den can be said to provide for the gamblers' material enjoyment in every possible way. Eating, drinking, playing, everything is available, and even sexual problems can be solved there at any time, as long as you have money. At the same time, in order to increase the power to attract gamblers, they also employ many female greeters, who serve the guests so well that they are willing to repay them there. Sometimes, some gamblers are only "drunkards whose minds are not on the wine," gambling with the goal of the female greeters rather than the money, but the gambling den always has a large influx of income, with no loss.</p>
<p>This "Monte Carlo" of the East is simply a "human hell" that buries young men and women!</p>
<p>Scientific Miscellany</p>
<h3>Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Chongde</p>
<p>Life and death, these two things, seem very clear and obvious, but scientifically examining them reveals that they are also two very difficult problems to understand. In the realm of matter, we seem to be able to say that all objects that have life are called living things, and objects without life are called dead things. But such an explanation is actually just a repetition of words, saying it is the same as saying nothing. Because what is called life, how to count an object as having life, and how to call an object lifeless are still problems to be explained. There are many different explanations for the concrete explanation of life, and here we should briefly list a few to examine.</p>
<p>Some people regard life as something eternal and unchanging in the universe, existing forever in the universe. If we deduce according to this statement, then life is a metaphysical special factor in the universe, which can be separated from the inferior material body. Existing creatures are only things that this life borrows as the embodiment of image and expression, and are only temporary dwellings. Because the existing visible organisms are not eternal, they are only discovered when the earth evolves to a certain stage. Since life is eternal, it is natural that life still exists before this tangible life substance and after this substance disappears. Thus, the so-called life is nothing but a special non-material spirit. The difference between living material and lifeless material is not in the organic and inorganic material entities themselves, but in whether this spiritual trait is injected into the tangible dead mass of all inferior materials. According to this, the organism itself has no so-called life and death. The so-called life and death is only an entry and exit of this spiritual life trait between the dead tangible inferior matter, and whether life continues or does not continue to regard this thing as a dwelling. This statement is a religious belief. The barbarian-invented statement that the soul is immortal, that ghosts continue to survive after death, and even Plato and many similar philosophical theories can be attributed to this category. And the absurdity of this statement does not need to be refuted.</p>
<p>Others use metabolism and sensation and reflection to distinguish between living and dead things. They believe that anything that can perform a kind of material exchange with the outside of the body, absorbing new materials from the outside and expelling old materials from the body, or if it encounters external matter and gives it an action, it can initiate a reaction change, is called a living thing. Conversely, it is dead matter. However, "metabolism itself can exist even without life." Because in chemical changes, a substance absorbs new external elements and combines with them under appropriate conditions, and releases the original elements to exist independently or combine with other substances,</p>
<p>Continued on Page 30</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<h2>Page 31</h2>
<p>is very common. Also, if an inorganic body is immersed in liquid juice, then its outer skin absorbs some liquid molecules into its own tissue, and some of its own molecules fall off, which is also common. As for sensation and reflection? Although the sensation and reflection of the inorganic world and the sensation and reflection of living bodies have some degree and meaning of difference, this is not a fundamental difference. Because under appropriate conditions, certain elements come together and immediately initiate the sensation and reflection activities of combination and decomposition, the mutual sensation and repulsion of electromagnetic fields, and when we strike a part of any object, it not only directly produces resistance, but also vibrates all the molecules to produce different movements.</p>
<p>Then how can we distinguish between living and dead things? Simply put, life, if said from the standpoint of pure natural science, is "the existence form of protein." Naturally, protoplasm is the foundation of life substance, but the reason why protoplasm can become the foundation of life substance is because it mostly contains protein. Protein has a special function in organic matter. Although this function is still performing the process of absorbing surrounding matter and assimilating it, and expelling old things from the individual, under the general law of metabolism, it is different from the merely similar change function of metal oxidation and rock weathering. Because the changes of these substances are the cause of their own destruction, while in protein they become a necessary condition for their own renewal and survival. Because of this, we can see that there is protein when there is life, and when protein decays and is destroyed, its function ceases, and then protoplasm also dies. Thus, the so-called living substance is an object with protein, and dead matter is an object without that thing. A cell is composed of three parts: the nucleus, protoplasm, and cell membrane, and the most primitive cells do not even have a cell membrane. Primitive organisms use a single cell to become an independent life. Then, the death of such a life individual is the destruction of protein, while symbiosis is the existence of protein, which is very clear.</p>
<p>However, precisely because of this, the boundary between life and death becomes difficult to discern in higher multicellular organisms. Because, for example, taking humans as an example, metabolism is carried out every minute and every second within the whole, adding new substances to form new cells and expelling dead cells. According to scientific research, people replace their entire body's cells in seven years. In that case, when can you say that a person is alive? To put it further, from the existence of sperm cells and egg cells, they have already had this seed of life. To put it closer, from continuing to grow up to old age and death, new cells are still being born, so this birth is difficult to determine. And when can it be considered dead? Not to mention that a person's cells have to be completely replaced several times in his life, that is to say, he has to die several times. Even if we talk about formal death, it is not a matter of an instant. He was already beginning to die when he was constantly aging. After death, it still takes some time for the cells to die completely! Therefore, death is also difficult to determine. Thus, the line between life and death in organisms cannot really be drawn as absolute. The beginning of life has death, which is death, and the beginning of death has life, which is life. Even so, we must not forget that a life body composed of a large number of cells has different characteristics due to the accumulation of its quantity. Just like humans, after being formed by a large number of cells, humans have the unified life characteristics of an overall organic connection. At this time, the life and death of a single cell cannot be used to encompass their life and death. Therefore, at this time, to determine the boundary of human life, it should start with the combination of sperm and egg cells and the beginning of development. Because before they are combined, sperm and egg cells cannot develop into humans alone. Although they are still a life at that time, it does not count as the beginning of human life. But once they are combined and develop, they have the possibility of inevitably growing into human life. In the process of growing up, although old cells are constantly dying, and even the entire body has to die once in seven years, this death does not harm the knot point of the entire human life. This cannot be regarded as the final death. Once breathing stops and the body is stiff and lying down, although some of the cells have not completely died, the life knot point of the entire organic function formed by them has been completely destroyed, which can certainly be regarded as formal death. To distinguish and judge this kind of life and death, we must use the kind of thinking method in which the part must be included in the whole, and the whole is also included in the part. That is, the part and the whole are synthesized and coexist and die. The death of the part does not damage the life of the whole and does not count as death. The death of the whole has matured, and even if the life of the part is still alive, it cannot be counted as life. Naturally, if there is no life of the part, there will be no life of the whole, and without the death of the part, there will be no death of the whole. This can be said to be a scientific view of life and death.</p>

<h3>Decline (2)</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>After a while, Afu carried in a wooden tray, on which were four small dishes. Mother hurriedly went over and carefully placed them one by one on the table. Then, she wiped the spoons and chopsticks, saying, "Kun'er! Let's eat. You've been on trains and boats all day; you must be hungry!"</p>
<p>"No, I ate on the train." My heart felt like it was weighed down by a stone, and I didn't feel any hunger. However, I didn't want to say that, so I just said I had eaten on the train earlier.</p>
<p>"Ate on the train? That won't be enough. Eat some more. There's 'hometown pork' here!" Mother picked up a piece of half-cooked, half-raw salted meat with her chopsticks and placed it in my rice bowl.</p>
<p>"Young master: This meat is just the beginning! Eat it quickly, or it will get cold!" Afu grinned.</p>
<p>"Have you all had dinner?" Unable to resist my mother's and their enthusiastic urging, I reluctantly picked up the bowl and ate.</p>
<p>"We've all eaten!" Mother interjected.</p>
<p>"So early? You still eat three meals a day like before?" Looking at their malnourished faces, I became suspicious.</p>
<p>"Yes... it's still the same as before." Mother's voice trembled a little.</p>
<p>Everyone's face showed a bitter smile, and they hummed unnaturally from their noses, barely getting through what I had said.</p>
<p>The "ancestral hall" became quiet for a moment, as silent as an ice cellar, so quiet that you could hear everyone's heart beating rapidly; I silently lowered my head, staring at the grains of rice in the bowl, chewing slowly, feeling like a prisoner awaiting execution, feeling uneasy about the many hungry eyes staring at me.</p>
<p>"Kun'er, eat quickly; be careful it gets cold, or you'll complain of a stomach ache. Child, what are you daydreaming about?" Mother's face was filled with a kind and melancholy expression. Then she said, "Afu! Take this bowl of meat soup to Aunt San and have her heat it up again? Oh! The food on the train isn't enough to fill you up. — Well! You all can go to sleep; it's getting late, and everyone is tired. Let's talk about that matter tomorrow? Alas!..." Mother turned around and said this to them, secretly using the corner of her clothes to dab at her face.</p>
<p>"Mmm..." Everyone responded softly, as if a load had been lifted from their shoulders, and they smiled at me with bitter faces as they walked out of the "ancestral hall."</p>
<p>"Young master! The hot soup is here; also changed a bowl of hot rice, cold cannot eat ah!" Afu carried in a bowl of steaming meat soup.</p>
<p>"No need, I'm too full to be comfortable." I shook my head, looking at him.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! The food on the train isn't enough to fill you up, eat a little more." Mother said, quickly standing up and pouring the soup into my bowl; "Drink some hot soup, don't eat the cold rice."</p>
<p>I buried my head and drank it mouthful by mouthful. Afu watched and smiled triumphantly, saying, "Young master, the old mistress likes you so much! Since you haven't been back, the old mistress has been talking about you every day!"</p>
<p>Looking at his triumphant appearance, I couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"Alas! It's not that I want him to come back every day, but what is there to do when he really comes back, in such a barren year? I always hoped he would earn more money outside, so he could start a family in the future and live comfortably; if his father had been willing to save some money when he was young, things wouldn't be like this today..." Mother said sadly, but she suddenly stopped talking when she mentioned Father.</p>
<p>"That's right! You can't do without a woman." Afu held back his smile and pursed his lips.</p>
<p>"Mom! Why hasn't Father come back so late? Did something happen at home?" I suddenly walked up to my mother and pressed her with my question.</p>
<p>Her gloomy eyes showed a restless and troubled expression, and she repeatedly shook her head, comforting me, "Nothing major has happened, he'll be back in a while." As she said this, she glanced at Afu.</p>
<p>"Afu! What did the boss (Note: Term for male owner by the hired workers) go to do, don't you know?" I asked sternly.</p>
<p>Afu scratched his scalp, looking very troubled, and glanced at my mother, saying, "Old mistress! Should I tell the young master?"</p>
<p>As he said this, he scratched his scalp again and continued, "The boss went to Master Wu's house in town. He left early this morning: Just now, Changgen came back and said, 'Master Wu said that if the boss doesn't pay the rent owed, he'll have to spend the New Year in the "District Office."' Mmm! Spend the New Year in the "District Office," does that mean they'll still have to face a lawsuit during the New Year? Shameful!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Handshake Between New York and Hollywood's Two Big Fatties</h3>
<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>Recently, a large fat man named Diamond Jim Brady came to a movie theater in New York, serving as the gatekeeper. According to general estimates, his belly is simply more than six times as big as that of an average person. This event could not help but draw the attention of many idle people in New York City and those who like to move around in entertainment venues. So the news quickly spread to Hollywood.</p>
<p>Guv Kibbee, also a famous big fat man in Hollywood, heard this news and made a special trip to New York to meet Diamond Jim Brady. Coincidentally, as they met and began talking, a newspaper reporter saw them. This newspaper reporter, driven by curiosity, felt that this was a very interesting news story, so he introduced himself and shook hands with Diamond Jim Brady and Guv Kibbee. Below is the newspaper reporter's account of his conversation after meeting with these two big fat men.</p>
<p>According to Guv Kibbee, he had never seen a fatter man than Diamond Jim Brady in his life, and even Olive Hardy was only about three-quarters of his size. He once specially consulted a doctor to examine his stomach and see how much food he needed to eat each day to be suitable. The doctor's examination concluded that he needed to eat three times more food than an average person each day to maintain the nutrients his body needed. But eating too much would make his body even fatter. This was dangerous for the elderly Guv Kibbee, because elderly fat people are particularly prone to stroke. So how was this problem resolved in the end? The doctor told him: he must drink six to seven pounds of water every day, and he must reduce his sleep. Guv Kibbee did as he was told, but the problem of obesity could not be completely cured.</p>
<p>Guv Kibbee also said: "I am a very prominent figure in Hollywood. Because I am naturally fat and also have a big personality, I dare not go out in a car. The shocks of the car often make my stomach feel sore. So when I go to film companies or social gatherings, I always walk. And when I walk on the road, I often inadvertently knock people over, especially women. Because of this, many men who are with women will argue with me, and even want to fight. But I always apologize to them politely. Over time, people have come to know that I am a fat man, so I often knock people over."</p>
<p>Indeed, if you go to the streets of Hollywood and ask around, everyone knows Guv Kibbee. They will all say, "Oh, that fat pig."</p>
<p>Diamond Jim Brady is a man of few words. Perhaps because he is shy, he did not say much to the newspaper reporter. He just said that he had always been a hermit, and dared not come out and make a fool of himself, fearing that people would deliberately make fun of him. But recently he had suddenly become impoverished and helpless. So he was dragged out of the countryside by his wife, who wanted him to work and earn money. Because Diamond Jim Brady eats a lot, it is not the same as just sitting around and eating for free. Coincidentally, this movie theater took a fancy to him and hired him. Because this is far more effective than advertising, and the instinct to attract movie fans is very strong.</p>
<p>Guv Kibbee is a big fat man, but standing next to Diamond Jim Brady, he looks like a small witch in comparison to a big one.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>A Review of "Melody of the Stage"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>Enter Madame _Cathay_</p>
<p>I think, everyone who has seen "Melody of the Stage" must be fascinated by some of the scenes in it. After the actress Lisa and the American boy Kirade get married, the two of them lean on each other by the moonlit river, listening to the melodious love songs, the intoxicating scenery, full of romantic sentiments. Secondly, there is the interlude of the opera "Cavateria Rusticana," the solemn prayers in the church, the chorus, Lisa's mournful heart, and the religious atmosphere permeating the entire theater, which cannot but greatly move even those without religious faith. Furthermore, Lisa returns with her husband Shen Hua, and many theater managers follow her closely, talking about business and signing contracts. Although Lisa and her husband are extremely tired, they cannot avoid being harassed by them. This chaotic atmosphere, in contrast to the night they discuss divorce later, when Kira and the servants and cooks sing together while banging on bowls and dishes, is equally lively, but this is clearly a different expression of happiness and sorrow. The above points are all brilliant expressions in the play. These serve as the director's techniques representative of this film, and the entire plot unfolds in a lively atmosphere, giving people a strong sense of joy and pleasure.</p>
<p>However, these pleasures cannot give people a fulfilling sense of reality, because the whole story is just a fiction created for the sake of the story. In fact, the story content has no positive elements at all, no, it does not even achieve the serious expression of life's meaning that old playwrights generally favored. The so-called serious expression of life's meaning does not mean that comedy cannot undertake this task; a humorous attitude can also express a serious life. However, "Melody of the Stage" is not like that; it merely expresses an extremely empty story in a very lighthearted manner.</p>
<p>A famous actress falls in love with a wealthy young man and quickly gets married. However, the husband cannot tolerate the actress's disturbances, and what he needs is the tenderness of love. So, after six or seven months, the husband falls in love with a widowed young woman and asks the actress for a divorce. If the play had started from here to depict the actress's pain of being lovelorn, it could have highly developed the play's emotions, but instead, the actress uses various methods to win back her husband's love, so that they are still reconciled and happy as before. Such a cliché handling of the plot almost makes us think it is unconscious child's play.</p>
<p>We know that some works of art are entirely about showing off skills, and "Melody of the Stage" is like that. This fits the argument of some people that form is everything in a work of art, while content is secondary. Little do they know that works like "Melody of the Stage" cannot give people even the minimum level of more profound emotion. I ask, who among the people who have seen this film can have a relatively deep impression? Even technically speaking, apart from the more brilliant parts mentioned above, it cannot give people much more temporary interest.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, the doctor, the maid, and the cook all have lovable personalities. No one denies that the actress, Iliza, can act, but she is too fiery here. If this film still retains the style of stage plays, it is expressed in her. As for the male lead Gary Grant, he has never had any in-depth performances, and here he is just fulfilling his duties in an ordinary way.</p>
<h3>Secrets Behind "Sequoia"</h3>
<p>— Yun Shui</p>
<p>The MGM film "Sequoia," currently showing in Nanjing, was originally called "Sequoia," based on V.J. Hoyt’s famous book “Mahbu,” hailed by European and American discussion circles as a cinematic miracle unseen in twenty years. At the same time, the film has aroused various speculations and questions from the outside world, most of which consider the production of such films impossible. Indeed, gathering a group of animals in one place and teaching them to perform a play is very difficult. However, "Sequoia" is definitely not a fake product of "camera tricks," which is also what the film's director Franklin has repeatedly stated and has evidence for. The following snippets of news, I think, may reveal the entire process of "Sequoia's" production, and of course, will also be welcomed by general movie fans:</p>
<p>(1) Background: In Sequoia National Forest in the High Sierrae of the United States, there is a forest called Sequoia Nafional Forsts, with dozens of acres cleared into a wide open space (note that the area covers a total of 180,000 acres), plus a small pond, and two smaller open spaces attached, and a small-scale animal pen. This is the film's shooting location. Later, the space created was not enough, and because the wild animals were all tamed, the entire forest was used as the background, and the beauty and magnificence of the camera shots are based on this.</p>
<p>(2) Time and Space: The most difficult problem in shooting animal films is the time issue. It is probably difficult to command animals as desired, so you must wait for opportunities, unlike humans who can work at any time. Therefore, the filming time took a full two years, and most of it (a very strange discovery) was shot at night, and the cameras often worked at an altitude of 11,000 feet.</p>
<p>(3) Characters: The characters in the play, of course, belong to animals with fur and horns, wings and shells (although Joan Park is the leading actress...). In addition to the two ladies, the deer Mariam, and the mountain lion Ganduo, there are also coyotes, bobcats, raccoons, wolves, bears, giant (hunting dogs), rattlesnakes, swans, etc. However, some believe that natural enemies born with a hatred for each other are raised under the same care, and they love each other without any hostility. But the rattlesnake is still an exception. As for how they can be trained to perform under the silver screen of spring water, it is simply by manipulating their food.</p>
<h3>Re-release of "I Want A Spy"</h3>
<p>— Yun Yan</p>
<p>"I Want A Spy" depicts a Belgian woman during the European war, how she cared about the country's safety and was enthusiastic about caring for wounded soldiers. When it was released in Europe and the United States, it caused a sensation far and wide. Madame Martha Mc Kenua worked as a nurse in the intelligence department within Belgium during World War I and established many extraordinary feats. At the time she had a reputation as a heroine. This film, "I Want A Spy," is based on her experiences in many ways. After the film was released, she made a statement praising the film.</p>
<p>The film was simultaneously released at the Guanglu and Lanxin theaters last year, and it also received excellent reviews. It is now said that it will make a comeback and will be released in Paris soon.</p>
<h3>Two Songs in "Children of the Storm"</h3>
<p>"Children of the Storm" is Diantong's very poetic and revolutionary first sound film. With artistic visuals, it combines a great plot; in between, it also includes lingering and poignant songs – "The Singer Under Iron Hooves", sung by the wandering Ah Feng, is the most touching. There is also "March of the Volunteers", sung by Yuan Muzhi and the common people, this melody can make us move forward from a passive life, rise up from the trap of decadence, and it is a stimulant for vigilance and excitement in the face of the national crisis.</p>

<p>The Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition was attended by 21 countries, with more than 121 films, and only ten were awarded. They belong to six countries: China, Russia, England, France, the United States, and Czechoslovakia. The "Song of the Fishermen," produced by Lianhua Company, won an honorary diploma for China. Mr. Tao Boshen, the general distributor manager of Lianhua Company, our country's representative, also returned in triumph the day before yesterday. The Shanghai cinemas and theaters believed that Mr. Tao's long journey was arduous and meritorious, and made Chinese films shine in foreign lands. In order to understand the situation of this film exhibition, they specially invited Mr. Tao this morning (the 31st) to report on the Soviet Russian Film Exhibition and the situation of the Soviet Russian film industry at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and invited people from all walks of life to participate.</p>

<h3>The Hate of India's Fall (Clive of India) (15)</h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>Clive continued to say loudly, "But after so many years of hard work, now to be called to face a public trial—to be stripped of everything I have, that is beyond my expectations. This is also what the British nation is unwilling to do. Gentlemen, I speak from my conscience, I am innocent. Before I sit down, I want to ask you for one thing—when you decide on the issue of my personal rights, please do not forget your own integrity."</p>
<p>Margaret, with tears streaming down her face, helped Captain Clark down. Where does Robert go now? Waiting for the House to judge his guilt? She didn't even dare to think about it. But Clive, without waiting for the House's judgment, had already walked out of the deliberation chamber. Edmund greeted him and shook his hand, comforting him. Clive touched the old wound on his head and said miserably, "I don't have anything to care about anymore. Alas! Why did I have to wait until today? Dozens of times, a bullet, a knife, an inch to the left, an inch to the right, could have ended my life, buried like a hero. A famous general has come to this point, just like a beauty in her old age, it would have been better to die sooner."</p>
<p>Once, he sighed again and said, "I want to go home, Edmund—Queen Square, to the old house." Edmund said, "Robert, now is not the time to be alone…" Clive said, "I am alone, I have no friends. Oh, no, I am too ungrateful." He looked at Edmund's face and said very sincerely, "You were my first friend, and you are my last friend. Please…I am going to Queen Square…" He lowered his head and walked out step by step.</p>
<p>Clive returned to the old house in Queen Square and sat alone in the large living room. He sat in his usual armchair, next to a small stool that Margaret sat on. In a daze, he unconsciously reached out and touched the small stool next to him, but Margaret was no longer there. He unconsciously retracted his hand, lowered his head, and closed his eyes, feeling that everything had become lonely…painful…a failure. He couldn't help but shout, "This is the end…"</p>
<p>But before he could finish speaking, Margaret had already walked in lightly. Her hand touched his hand, but he wasn't surprised at all. When she kissed his lips, he seemed to return to the first time they met. He slowly opened his eyes and asked, "Do you know that I need you?" Margaret said, "I know." Clive said, "A long and difficult road, we have already walked it, and now we are waiting for the end to come."</p>
<p>At this moment, the servant walked in and whispered a report: The Prime Minister has arrived. Clive immediately ordered him to be invited in. His eyes were blurred with pain. He said to Margaret, "The Prime Minister coming here in the middle of the night is mostly a bad omen." He wanted to stand up, but the wound on his head had made his legs as soft as cotton, unable to stand steady. The Prime Minister walked to the door and bowed, saying, "Lady Clive." Margaret also bowed and said, "My husband is ill, please forgive him for not being able to stand up." The Prime Minister bowed again to Clive and said, "I am under the command of His Majesty the King to convey the King's decree, no matter what the House's judgment is, His Majesty personally is always grateful for the Lord's achievements."</p>
<p>It turned out that the majority of the House felt that Clive's actions were indecent, but at the same time, they also felt that he had indeed contributed to the country, so the proposal to seize his property was not passed. And his reputation? Since the King has especially comforted him, it can also be unproblematic. Clive immediately stood up, took Margaret's shoulders, and said to the Prime Minister, "Please convey all my gratitude to His Majesty when you return." All pain has become a thing of the past. After the Prime Minister left, Clive settled down and held Margaret in his arms, as tender and affectionate as when they first met. (The End)</p>
