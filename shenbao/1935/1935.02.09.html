<p>計六十五萬萬盧布收支相抵有盈無絀</p>
<p>（莫斯科）今日已舉定委員三十二人、擔任修正蘇俄憲法事、將以史丹林爲委員會主席、據財政委員格林柯報告、蘇俄財政視前益見穩固、一九三五年預算案雖經增加巨額之國防費、然仍有盈餘五萬萬盧布之望、預計收入共爲六五·七○○·○○○·○○○盧布、支出共爲六五·二○○·○○○·○○○盧布、是年國防經費因陸軍糧價見增及擴大兵額之故、共達六·五○○·○○○·○○○盧布云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯本屆中央執行委員會第一次常會時、財政人民委員長格林科報告云、「蘇聯國家預算四年以來已增加四倍有半、卽自一九二九丨三○年之一二○億盧布、增爲一九三四年之五三七億盧布、四年之中用於社會主義建設之欵項、共凡一·五一○億盧布、舉世國家預算能有如此擴展、且有如此盈餘者、唯吾蘇聯一國、此乃社會主義之勝利、社會主義經濟之發展、以及勞動大衆福利增加之結果也、</p>
<p>此點得以蘇聯通貨流動之加强、以及盧布匯兌率之提高表示之、至一九三五年一月一日全國流通貨幣量、幾較一九三三年一月一日减少七億盧布、而兩年之中商品銷售量則增加百分之四十六、此外一九三四年工業利潤之積累、亦以生產成本减少及勞動生產率之提高、增至七十五億盧布、吾人以公債及儲蓄銀行存欵之形式、擴大國民儲欵之集中、已經成功、計國家債券持有人已自八百萬</p>

<p>增爲四千五百萬、儲蓄銀行存户已達三千五百萬人、存欵總額達十六億盧布、凡此均能表示國民物質生活之改善、及其對於蘇維埃通貨之信任、一九三五年之國家預算已經政府决定、計收入項下六五七億盧布、支出項下六五二億盧布、計預算總額較上年增加之部份中、七十二億盧布撥充國民經濟之投資、十五億作文化建設、十五億充國防、四十億上下補充地方預算、二十億作爲國家銀行鞏固信用之用、</p>

<p>格氏述及國防經費之增加時稱、「一九三四年國防經費超出預定額數（一六·六五億）甚大、卽用至五十億盧布、其原因一爲紅軍所用材料與機械、因廢止計口授糧制而漲價、二爲紅軍之擴充、其三則爲重工業（彼已完成紅軍訂購技術設備計劃）方面之生產成本、較諸預計稍有超過、一九三五年吾國國防經費定爲六十五億盧布、唯蘇聯國防委員會在國家預算中所佔經費、較諸資本主義國家之軍費猶遠爲低微」云、格氏結束時力稱、蘇聯盧布及整個財政制度日益强固、同時目下不用向國外重利債欵、建設社會主義經濟云、（七日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>災害之來。被禍最切者。厥爲農民。是故言救濟者。當以農民爲主要之對象。救濟之方法。普通分爲急振（即義振）工振與農振三者。施救之步驟。則以急工爲先。農善其後。查明老弱婦孺非振不活者。計口授食授衣。或授以金錢。使之免於溝壑。是爲急振。擇少壯者，在災區築路浚河。修堤墾荒。使得以工作之方法。謀個人之温飽。是爲工振。工振之作用。足以維持受振者自尊之德性。抑且利用其精力。爲地方謀建設。故財無盧投。力無虚耗。然急工兩者而外。如無農振以善其後。則不能澈底也。農振以種籽肥料等施給。或貸欵災農。扶助其回復生業。恢復生產力量。以完成急工兩振之功效。以達救濟之最終目的。無此則災農雖藉急工所施得暫時維持生命。一旦欵盡振止。勢不得不流徙四方。致令田地荒蕪。不可收拾。是故言人道。言經濟。農振之重要。實爲三者冠。在整個救濟災農之計劃中。所最要而不可或缺之步驟也。</p>
<p>去歲亢旱成災。據振務委員會調查被災田畝。共計在一萬萬三千三百餘萬畝以上。爲繼二十年長江水災後之巨災。中央雖未設有特殊之機關。以專任救濟工作。但上海有各省旱災義振籌募委員會。集全國慈善界領袖與中樞要員而組織之半官性質的機關。以主持其事。正在積極進行。但據歷次報章所載該會消息。則自十月成立迄今。共收捐欵不及五十萬元。已由中央撥給者計五十五萬元。兩共收入約僅一百萬元。而該會預定工作支配於急振者。約一百萬元。夫急振之後。尙須繼之以農振。則將來農振之欵。將從何出乎。夫以災區若是之遼闊。以一百萬元辦理急振。猶嫌不足。而農振所需之欵。尤爲浩大。今試以上述振務委員會所查得之數之兩成作爲最嚴重之區計之。亦當在三千萬畝左右。以種籽一項所需而論。每畝約需籽三升半。即需一百萬担。或國幣七百餘萬元。此豈籌募所可得。國庫所能應乎。是誠足</p>
<p>令吾人憂慮無已者也。</p>
<p>夫擁有巨資足以借給社會國家種種巨大資金之需要者。惟金融界耳。金融業者如能在災區内貸欵農民。俾得購備種籽。從事春耕。則恢復農村。誠屬事半功倍。災農可不待振而自救矣。我全國人士所早夕戚戚憂思者。即欲得一總解决。此種希望。此種鼓勵。見之於報章時論集會討論間者。亦已多矣。夫以都市金融之膨漲壅塞。金融業者固亦未嘗無此想。然而尙猶豫不前。農民依然告貸無門。望田嘆惜者何歟。蓋金融業之本身。以營利爲主。投資放欵。務求穩妥安全。奚肯以股東之血汗。爲冒險之嘗試。故放欵於商人者。必其人具有悠遠之信用。或可靠之抵押。投資於農村者。必其農民有合作社之組織。或有農產物可供抵押者。今若在災區之内。貸欵於赤貧之民。無組織。無長物。其所負之危險爲何如乎。即經調查屬實。該借欵之農民。確以所借之欵爲耕種之用。如商人之確爲用於生利之商業行爲者然。第農產之成功。屬於人力者半。屬於天時者半。將來能否豐收。事前何能預知。此可慮者一。即豐收矣。設又遇如去年之穀賤傷農。得不償本。農民將以何者爲償還借欵之資乎。此可慮者二。凡此皆金融業爲求自身之穩固與經營之利益所不能不考慮者也。吾人設身處地。應有同感。是故解决農振之問題。在解决如何减少災區農村貸欵之危險。</p>
<p>我人旣知振救災區同胞。扶助其回復生業。爲整個國家之事。不應責成任何份子。單獨負責。而事實上則惟金融業者具此魄力。則解决農振之方法。或在合政府與金融業者之力量。以同趨之可爾。吾人之所謂方法。具體言之。即由金融業者在災區放欵於農民。由政府對於放欵全部負保本保息之責是也。金融業者放欵於農民。應以營業之方式乎續爲之。應視其以所貸之欵。確實用於春耕。有資產者取具抵押。赤貧者以若干人爲連環保證。而政府則爲其貸欵之保障。保證其本息之清償。凡爲農民因天禍人事。而不能償還之部份。槪由政府擔承賠償。如此行之。則政府無立即籌支巨欵之必要。金融業者獲一穩妥安全之投資市塲。而災區農民。則有克紹來蘇重整田畝之望。一舉之得。利莫大焉。在政府之立塲言之。可謂改換向來農振之辦法。不施不捨。而以國家之財力。作有力之保證。引金融界之金錢。以扶助災農。恢復生產。無救濟之形色。而得救濟之實效。是誠不得已中之最善辦法也。更</p>

<p>（倫敦）首相麥唐納本日在魯頓貝特福國民政府宣傳會議、發表關於最近英法談話之演說、略謂、「德法兩國所提出之要求、均使對方爲顧全國家體而、無法接受、問題之癥結卽在於此、吾人舉行談話時、對於雙方要求同時兼顧、今吾人已與</p>
<p>附擬大綱數條以揭明之。</p>
<p>㈠政府查明受災最嚴重之縣區而公佈之。</p>
<p>㈡在政府所公佈之受災最嚴重之區域内。金融業者貸欵於農民。或於其他機關之從事直接放欵於農民從事耕作者。政府對於所貸放之欵。負保本保息之責任。</p>
<p>㈢金融業貸欵農民。必須調查得所放之欵。確屬用於春耕。或該機關確爲轉放於從事春耕之災農。</p>
<p>㈣放欵得以種籽作價代之。</p>
<p>㈤放欵需照普通乎續辦理。有可抵押者取其抵押品。不足或完全無抵押時。應具五人以上之連環擔保。</p>
<p>㈥秋收時如遇有穀價奇賤。農民得不償欠時。政府得以高價收買之。使得以償還貸欵。</p>
<p>㈦如遇有天災人禍以致歉收。或其他人事上關係。致不能償還貸欵之一部份或全部份時。由政府與金融業代表所組織之清理委員會。調查屬實。即由政府撥欵補償之。</p>
<p>㈧政府所代爲補償之部份。農民仍須負責。但由政府擔保。由金融業者繼續貸欵。使得繼續耕種。以期清償於將來。</p>
<p>國人對於救災之熱忱。似已遠不如昔。證以該旱災委員會盡四五個月之努力。所捐得者不及五十萬元。而二十年水災時。一星期内國人之輸捐於水災委員會者。達一百萬元。可以見之。近年來社會經濟狀况。遠不如昔。或亦爲原因之一。而旱災之影響。對於一般居住於都會者之不若水災之顯而易見。要亦爲心理上之所或有。實則旱災之痛苦。久而愈深。報紙所載之農民全家服毒自殺者。猶未能盡其萬一也。春耕之期旣屆。吾人爲人道。爲國家。爲自已。農振之策。於此時此刻。可不奮起而行之哉。</p>

<p>農村窮乏　國債增加</p>
<p>一九三四年結算、日本社會經濟上的危機、如東北六縣的凍災、九州的旱災、算是過去了、但是眞正的困難、到一九三五年纔起頭、沒有飯吃的問題、影響及於整個社會、也要新年以後纔漸次發露、軍部方面、於去冬把幾十萬件被服等類的製作品、發給該地方民間婦女、用手工作、論總數確是不少、但分開來也就很有限了、日本農村的根本問題、不是一時的、而是帶有恒久性的、所以左右兩極端的人、都各自有他們積極的主張、對現制度表示不滿、</p>
<p>政治上在去年年底、宣告了廢除海軍條約所規定的比率主義、國際間幸而不曾引起什麽意外的反響、就某一方面看、似乎還很有利、不過英國的警戒、在新嘉坡·香港·等海軍根據地、已相當的明顯、日本對英已暗示讓步、以求將來的轉旋、甚至希望英日同盟的復活、美國增加軍事預算、已由今年的五萬八千五百萬美金、將於明年增加至七萬九千二百萬美金、再加上復興費一萬萬美金、海陸軍費總數達九萬萬了、與日本的十萬零二千一百萬相較、也正是旗鼓相當、日本於此、表面上固然很沉靜、實際上不能不有些顧慮、要趕快籌劃應付的方法、此皆於經濟上大有關係的、</p>
<p>一般的經濟情勢、過去一年間的日本、似乎很多樂觀的材料、鋼鐵的生產、大約要有三百九十萬噸、足證其軍需工業發達的敏速、一朝有事、頗有自給自足的可能、輸出貿易、單是棉布、就差不多有二十四萬萬平方碼、其餘人造絲等一齊上進、造成她貿易上的新紀錄、所缺憾的第一是生絲輸出减退、不及極盛時代的二分之一、石油出產、總額僅祗六百萬箱、與需要總額比較、不過十分之一、再則農村負債、因生絲跌價的關係、竟無法償還、其影響於都市是非常巨大的、</p>
<p>因此政府財政、樂觀論固然高唱入雲、但悲觀的暗流、亦仍澎湃汹湧、一九三五年度通常會計收入、縱略見增加、而赤字公債、還是要發行五萬六千五百萬日金、其他還要特别會計與各種事業公債、合計起來、共計有七萬五千萬日金、以上的公債、如以四厘計息、則明年度至少要增加公債利息金三千萬日金了、今年以前各種應付的息金、計算起來、已達三萬七千八百日金、再加上前述數目、則明年以後、卽須償付利息四萬零八百圓日金了、至於以往所發行各種公債的總數、到去年底止、共有八十六萬四千一百萬日金、再加上去年預算上應該發行而未發的四萬萬、與一九三五年度的公債、到了明年、日本國債、就會有九十八萬七千七百萬圓、還有所謂米穀證券與財政部證券等短期國債、三萬萬餘圓、總計起來、要超過一百萬萬而有餘了、論利息（以四厘計）每年當有四萬萬圓、占全日本國庫總支出的五分之一、占租稅收入二分之一而强、計其總數、差不多要占全日本國總數的十分之一、</p>
<p>如此情形、誰說日本的財力、是絕無憂慮永遠樂觀的、高橋是清上台、就以爲財政前途、樂觀的材料很多、再繼續發行公債、也不愁沒有市塲、資本家更有餘力、其理想以爲他們還有剩餘的遊資、投到海外去頗不放心、購買公債、比較穩便、然而世界局勢的變遷、眞正的和平、尙靠不住、軍備擴張、自在意中、日本擴大軍費預算、是不能避免的事、何况面臨所謂「國際危機」、恐怕最近的數年間、將更要增加軍費、則公債數目、再加多少、現正難於預測哩、（一月二十八日於東京）</p>

<p>路透社七日倫敦電云、今日下院開會時、復提及通州船遇盜事、保守黨議員愛格紐提議、應訓令駐華英使賈德幹·與中政府恊商、藉英海軍之輔助、廓清大鵬灣等處海盜巢窟辦法、掌壐大臣艾登答稱、中國水面之海盜問題、現正在審愼注意中、凡足有裨此事之計畫、决不膜視、中英海軍現方密切合作、此時若續作其他行動、未見有何裨益云、該議員又謂、聞此種海盜不能專以海軍勦治之、艾登答曰、余意海上所取之行動、已獲特殊良好之結果、艾登續稱、駐上海英總領事白利南、將會同海軍當道、與工部局警務處、澈查通州船被盜騎刦案、阿格紐於是又問政府、是否擬請中政府派兵圍攻海盜在岸上之巢窟而窮治之、艾登答稱、中英當道密切合作、頗爲有效、旋保守黨議員馬斯登詢艾登、將否請國聯轉達海盜、令示好感、引起四座之笑、艾登置之不答、</p>
<p>路透社八日香港電云、海軍當局今日聲稱、中國軍隊、在大鵬灣西面、捕獲一月二十九日騎刧通州輪之海盜一名、其餘盜匪、亦正在追捕中、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、今晨（八日）九時英當道復在太古輪船公司開庭澈查通州輪船盜刦案、由駐滬英總領事白利南爵士主席、法租界與公共租界之警務處駐華英海軍及太古公司均派代表列席、俟澈查完畢、其報告書將呈交駐華英公使（轉致倫敦）及駐華英海軍總司令、聞其中並不含有建議、據今昨兩日澈查之情形觀之、將詳紀目擊者所述當日盜刦情形、製成報告書、聞上海中國内地敎會之職員亦被傳作證、證人中有華人俄人、所述一切、須譯成英文、故須稍廷時日、聞將商諸專家、修正防盜辦法、而尤注重乘船條例船中鐵柵與無綫電三項云、</p>

<p>— 陳憲文</p>
<p>製造和經濟最合業餘家的口味</p>
<p>近來常在雜誌上看到很多式樣的發射機，當時看了心裏很發癢，雖然很想一試，但爲經濟所限，只有失望。最近新試了一個最經濟的方法，所費不過十數元，而可造成一架輸出能力在五瓦特以上的發射機。</p>
<p>這機的振盪部分和平常所見的沒有大分别，所不同的只是電源部分；而最經濟的也要屬這部分了。普通電源變壓器除買現成貨外，就非自製不可，但買現貨旣貴，而又與業餘家的口味不合。那麽只有自製，但自製時感困難的就是繞綫；因爲發射機所需屏電壓很高，若要繞一半波（HalfWave）整流的高壓綫圈非二三千圈不可，而且普通所用（卽小型變壓器）多爲三十號左右較細之綫，故繞時更爲困難。若再加以初級綫圈則共須繞三四千圈。這在有自動記圈數的繞綫機的同志們倒不算什麽，但是我們要想想俱有上述條件的同志們能有幾多？所以要說繞一個三四千圈的綫圈，誰聽見都會要頭痛的，現在有了下面的方法，同志們可以不會頭痛了，因爲一共只要繞二千二百圈就可以得到四百弗打（Volt）的“Ｂ”電，這不是一件很便宜的事！而且全部電源變壓器造成最多不過四元，所以可以說是經濟已極。下面先說發射部分：</p>
<p>發射機的綫路係採用屏柵配諧式（Ｔ·P·T·G·），取其調節較易，且週率穩定，最適於初學者之試騐。其中柵電路電容器可省掉（圖中未畫）而代以活動式綫圈，故其週率仍爲可變。發射機之綫路如圖一。全機所用零件除L⒈、L２、L３須自製外，其餘均爲收音機上所拆下的舊貨。Ｌ１和Ｌ２係用Ｂ·＆Ｓ·１２號祼銅綫所繞成。（註一）除Ｌ３外Ｌ１及Ｌ２均用間隙繞，間隙等於綫之直徑（卽２·０５３m·m）。Ｌ１繞六圈Ｌ２及Ｌ３之圈數與週率之關係詳於下表：</p>
<p>綫圈　　綫圈之徑　圈數　週率（Ｋ·Ｃ·）　　Ｌ２　　　　21／２＂　２０　１７５０</p>
<p>Ｌ２　　２１／２＂　８　　３５００</p>

<p>圖中Ｃ４爲兩個·００４ＭＦＤ固定電容器，因其爲收音機式，不能耐較高電壓，故此處用二只串聯，每只所受之電壓减半，可不至有短路之危險。此外綫路簡單，無庸多說，大家都會知道：至於發射機調整一層，我想讀者一定比我高明的多，所以在此處就用不着我說。下面來講我們的電源。</p>
<p>這個電源可以分爲二部，一部是整流部分（也就是＂Ｂ＂電）另外一部是燈絲電流供給。全部電源係由四個電鈴變壓器來供給。作者所用的是：國貨馬牌電鈴變壓器（當然其他牌號者亦可，不過須知道牠的輸入電能確爲十瓦特才行）。此種變壓器雖售價一樣，貨色常常會不同，（註二）買時須注意。變壓器購得後，便要開始繞綫工作。先將變壓器拆開，將四只的次級綫圈均拆去。Ｔ１和Ｔ２的改造方法是一樣，均用Ｂ·＆Ｓ·三十號漆包綫繞一千一百圈作Ｔ１和Ｔ２的次級綫圈。（繞時第一層和第二層之間不可隔以較厚之絕緣物，恐其所佔空間太大，致綫圈無法繞下）在應用時則須反過來用，卽原來初級，作現在的高壓次級，原來次級，來作現在的初級，不過在聯接時須注意的是：兩個１１００圈的初級（照現在說），係串聯於２２０弗打電路中：其次級則並聯。當綫圈繞完後卽可將原來鐵片挿入。此種變壓器鐵片中留有空隙（係散熱之用），現在應用時須找一點黑鐵片（這種黑鐵大半自製變壓器的同志們都會有的。若有砂鋼片則更佳），把這些空氣隙添滿，使鐵心横截面加大。按表面上看來似乎不能照上面所說那樣用，因爲原來初級係二二○弗打，改後次級爲五十五弗打，怎能將五十五弗打的次級綫圈聯於一一○弗打電路中呢？其中的緣故是：廠家製造電鈴變壓器時，是按照初級（二二○弗打綫圈）是永遠接在二二○弗打綫上，而電鈴開關則串聯於次級中，故其初級圈數，常較普通所計算者爲多，况且現在又將鐵心横截面積加倍，所以用牠的五十五弗打綫圈，接在一一○弗打綫中，是無妨的。</p>
<p>Ｔ１和Ｔ２繞好後，可以開始繞Ｔ３Ｔ４，這兩個的圈數也是相同的（假如是用４５振盪），均用Ｂ·＆·Ｓ·十六號漆包綫繞五十圈；Ｔ４用十八號綫繞亦可，不過爲購買方便計可均用十六號者。待四只變壓器繞完後卽可照第二圖之綫路聯接，而全部發射機亦於此告完成。</p>

<p>註一：Ｌ１和Ｌ２所以用裸銅絲的緣故是㈠低廉，此機中幾種波段，一共所用之銅絲尙不及半斤。若以銅絲之價與銅管比當爲數十與一之比。㈡因發射工率較小，用銅管和銅絲之効率相差無幾，故採用銅絲較合宜</p>
<p>註二：　不久以前，友人購得此種變壓器，回家一試，雖不與以負荷（noload）約三四十分鐘後便自熱起來，原因大約是短路或渦流（EddyCurrent)所致。</p>

<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>去吾鄕西郭外，沒有一里的路，有一箇特别高大的土饅頭，隆然凸起，蔓草叢生，好像一座小山一般。這土饅頭作八角形，每邊甃以石塊，辨不出那一邊是正面，那一邊是背後。因爲狀如八卦，鄕人便呌字做「八卦墳。」</p>
<p>據說，這八卦墳的後裔，在明季是非常發達，而且演貴榮華的。因爲這八卦墳是蒸籠形，當時在八卦墳的左右前後，都是人家，炊烟四起，很像蒸籠燒熱，熱氣蓬勃。所以，八卦墳的後裔，都發達起來，富貴榮華了。到了清妆，墳旁的住户，都搬進城内來住，因此破了風水，蒸籠冷了起來；所以八卦墳的後裔都式微了。咱的朋友這樣說。</p>
<p>哦！這原來是明嘉靖時，阿附嚴分宜炙手可熱的趙文華的墓啊。分宜當國，號爲權奸，趙文華雖爲嚴黨，在家鄕却很有作爲，像修築縣城，建甲乙亭，很肯爲桑梓服務。所以，邑人至今，雖鄙視他，却稱他呌做『亮奸』。說奸是奸的，腦經還算不來糊塗，究竟比現在的『漢奸』『奸商』，勝一籌咧，咱這樣的對朋友講。</p>
<p>沒有四百年，趙文華的子孫，眞是衰落得令人可嘆！固然，全縣裏找不到幾家趙家，並且貧苦不堪。現在南門相近的楠木廳，門外還蹲着兩頭石狻猊，據說楠木廳便是趙文華的舊宅咧。咱去年在上海××馬路，碰見一個癟三，哀哀地向咱求乞。據說，這位癟三，的的確確是趙文華後裔呢。朋友又對咱這樣說</p>
<p>咱不覺嘆了一口氣，沒有别的回答。</p>

<p>遜清康煕第六子雍正之弟果親王，於雍正四年出巡川康各地，在打箭鑪居住約十年，旋納明正土司之女爲妃，世傳西康各地土司皆果親王之後裔。蓋西康土司，槪係甲木兩姓，說者謂分果字爲兩截，故斷言爲果親王之苗裔也。果親王以雍正殘殺弟兄，不敢回京，逗留西康，迄雍正逝世，始返朝覆命。當雍正死耗傳至西康時，果親王在離江縣成服臥草，故雅江現尙有臥龍石，即當時之遺跡也。果親王在康居住旣久，深悉風俗民情，其所作一筆勾，描寫西康風俗甚爲盡致，茲探誌於次，以見西康風俗之一般。</p>

<p>— 張枕綠</p>
<p>我國素習重文輕武，造成積弱不振的民族國家。祇有少數有志之士，對於武術肯研究，發明，練習，傳授，因我國開化得久遠，武藝的成就也比别國的精深偉大。就在現今我國百不如人的時代，一個俄國大力士到北平來獻藝，自號天下無敵，却被我國一個姓楊的女子從鄉僻地方來把他嚇退，也可聊以解嘲。可惜的是，我國儘有大本領的武術家世代存在，祇像寳貝那麽的很少很少，不能化行普遍，養成全民族的尙武精神，徒供人在酒後茶餘，驚歎他們的奇方異能，釀成有似神話一般的印象罷了！</p>
<p>我在這裏記一位名呌金文濤的武術家，他是回敎徒，本來是做珠寳生意的，歷年往來滬粤，也幾次出國到　邏南洋一帶，　賤販貴，他的命運也屢次騰達坎坷。但他在十四五歲時候，無意中逢到一位姓沙的也是回敎徒的老頭，傳授給他種種武術，下了十年積極的苦功，纔自覺稍有成績。金君在每晚上靜坐的工作，却至今終年不廢：他入睡的時間很少，常以打坐代睡，而精神格外强旺。他的師傅的名字，他從未知曉，只稱爲沙師傅。他常常接濟他師傅的經費，直到送他師傅的終，治喪服孝爲止，因爲沙老頭旣無家室近親，也無其他子弟的；這也可見他師傅的來歷之奇，和這師弟二人遇合之美了！</p>
<p>金君雖擅武術，他的容貎很清癯，又是服務商界的，就是平日接近他的人，也有不知他是有武藝的；他自己又深自隱歛，不肯在人面前顯露他的能爲。饒他這樣，在十幾年前，尙有人會從遠道來訪他，說是慕名求敎。經他再三謙退請免而不見許，他祇得抱了三分虚心，在僻靜地點和來客相角。沒幾個照面後，他起一脚挑跌得來客服輸而去。</p>
<p>金君在中年以後，厭倦了經商的風塵跋涉，息居上海。有人勸他設塲授徒，他說：「我還有一點其他的吃飯本事，比較敎武要有益些」。於是他以推拿術行醫，現在他還庽在雲南路溫泉浴室斜對面里内，以應病家。</p>

<p>丨點綴市面行市未開丨</p>
<p>昨即舊歷新正初五日、呢絨業俱於早晨一時接財神開市、賣方相繼整樣開盤、跑街掮客均四出兜攬生意、買方爲情面關係、多先後點綴選配、此種年初首次開手交易、雙方均稱爲「元寳生意」、大半悉與去歲收盤價相等、蓋近數天中、公會上標準價尙未議出、故買賣尙有待也、</p>

<p>但實銷尙呆</p>
<p>昨日南北貨行盤議價、均已定妥、大部份俱見升漲、南貨中金山枝漲度較甚、如糯米枝以地價關係、漲起三四十元、圓枝扁枝亦漲四五元至近十元不一、桂圓肉升一二元、篩莊桂圓除頂極較呆外、中小式升二三元、北貨中主要貨品、亦均轉升、如金針菜升一二元、湘蓮升三四元、白蓮升二三元、木耳升五六元、桃肉核桃升三四元、黑瓜子升四五角、榨菓上檔升元許、下檔無甚上落、其餘紅黑棗綫粉平等上落較平、但實銷尙未大動、漲勢能否穩固、仍須以去胃盛衰爲轉移、昨市僅另星應酬交易、桂圓行收束者、有和豐德豐等三四家、或有一二家更家、北貨行收束或改組者、有四五家、其間得有盈餘者、僅少數、蓋去年以農村破產、營業均遭减縮、獲利機會不多故耳、</p>

<h3 id="c281">剷去煤渣 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 胡洛</p>
<p>火爐中的燃燒，到了一定的時期，便表現衰頽了。這時，就應當把底下一層的煤渣除去，加進些新的，烏黑得發亮的煤塊。於是火爐又熱烈了，盛旺了。</p>
<p>文學也是一樣，一時代一時代地放着異彩。當一個社會轉化成另一個社會時，社會上便產生兩種相異的文學來：一種是有生氣的，向上的；另一種却是頽廢的，向下的。前一種是新加進的煤塊，正是在發着通紅的火光；後一種只是燃燒垂盡的煤，已漸漸地在消失牠的火熖了。牠的結果便是煤渣，這煤渣必然地將遭受那被剷除的運命。在浪漫主義初興時，便是個正在燒燃着的煤塊，我們可以看見那種偉大，超凡，新銳的火熖。囂俄便在「黑爾那尼」中呼呌着：「啊，民衆！大洋！奔騰的波濤！······這破壞玉座，搖動墳墓的波濤！」然而，煤的燃燒是會逐漸消滅的，牠會由紅烈的火熖變而爲黯淡的光，再就變成煤渣了。社會的進化，也便使這文學的「火爐」形成新陳代謝的狀態，浪漫主義文學必然地走到自然主義來。同時，他們年青時的熱情火熖也漸漸地消失掉，他們「欲逃避其時代，到過去時代（尤其是中世）理想的境界，或人生的抽象中，以爲隱匿之地」（伊苛維奇語）於是寫實主義成了浪漫主義之否定，而成了新加入的煤塊，又在火爐裏燃燒了。浪漫主義成了煤渣，只好被剷除掉。</p>
<p>在某一社會正在變動時，新的煤塊與將要變做煤渣的煤塊都還存在於文學的「火爐」中。在這時候，煤渣固然有牠必然沉落的命運，但牠還時在掙扎，時在阻碍着爐火的進展。有時因爲煤渣過多，會使爐火黯淡下來，甚至還可以使爐火暫時熄滅掉。所以，在時代進展中，煤渣的作用便在阻碍社會的進化。爲了社會的前途起見，實有剷去煤渣的必要。然而，還有人這樣說：「那些將要變作煤渣的文學，或者並不是我們的仇敵，我們如其攻擊，不如招撫。」這豈不是對煤渣作辯護麽？固然，煤渣在歷史上也有牠的價値，然而在煤渣阻碍爐火的盛旺時，我們只有嚴肅地去攻擊，批判牠們。現社會中還流行着低級的禮拜六派的小說，也流行着多角的戀愛小說，更有專寫舞女，馬戲班，頽廢小說。但是，無可否認地，這些都是煤渣呵！煤渣正使爐火的光黯淡起來。爲着文學的前途，我們不但要給以攻擊，批判，還得努力剷牠們出火爐來，更要用水澆滅牠們的餘焰！</p>
<p>我們也知道，還有許多新的，烏黑得發亮的煤正在等待着點燃。只有這些新的煤塊，才可以使文學的爐火熾熱，紅烈起來！</p>
<h3 id="c282">「買愁集」 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 再青</p>
<p>錢尙瀛（振之），自署綏山主人，歷史不詳。曾經看到他的隨筆「買愁集」四卷，大都根據前人詩詞，略參故實，或完全出於想像，演繹成爲小說，多則二百字，少則數十言。每卷前有親筆刻序，有弁言。　從友人處借讀時，曾選抄二則。其一云：「揭徯斯未達時，游湖湘間。一日，泊舟江涘，夜二鼓，攬衣露坐，仰視明月如晝。或中流一擢漸逼，内有一素妝女子，歛袵而起，容儀甚雅。徯斯問之，曰，妾商婦也。良人久不歸，聞君來，故相迓耳。因與談，甚愜懷，迨曉，戀戀不忍去。贈徯斯詩云，盤塘江上是奴家，郎若閒時來吃茶；黄土作牆茅蓋屋，庭前一樹紫荆花。明日，舟行阻風，上岸沽酒，問之，卽盤塘鎭。行數步，見一舍牆垣，中庭紫荆芬然。一小　立花下：問之，云，家主遠行，娘子獨居，臥病三載而逝，昨營葬後園耳。斯往視之，見塚前紫荆甚茂。徯徘徊不覺淚沾塚土。」</p>
<p>其二，爲根據崔護桃花詩所演繹成者，在全集中，是最好的一則，其文云：「崔護初舉進士不第，清明獨遊都城南，得村居，花木叢萃。護叩門久之，有女子自門隙問之。對曰：尋春獨行，酒渴求飲。女人啓門以一盂水至，獨倚小桃柯停，而意屬殊厚。崔辭起，送至門，如不勝情而入，後絕不復至。及來歲清明，徑往尋之，而門已　鐵矣。因題詩左扉云：去年今日此門中，人面桃花相映紅。人面祗今何處去，桃花依舊笑春風。」「人面不知」，此處作「人面祗今」，不知是否根據另一種本子，抑係尙濠記憶之誤。</p>
<p>轉載他作甚長者，亦偶一有之，如屠隆「冥寥子遊」，此書則將其上篇全部轉錄。記鐵鉉女一則，與「百家小說」所記，也頗有出入。據此記，是說「鐵鉉爲布政，靖難時死節。二女皆國色。　　怒，令入敎坊。數日辛苦萬狀，誓不受辱。時有鉉同官至，二女爲詩以獻」，不知誰爲可靠。此書在筆記小說中，可說是另闢蹊徑之作，惜佳者不多。我所見明刻本，板式字體均不差，惜錯字所在多是，不知是否主人初刻。</p>
<h3 id="c283">轎車 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>丨大行追記丨</p>
<p>冒雨到山裏去，是一種幸福，雖然有時要打折扣。</p>
<p>那天下的是「客舍青青柳色新」的浥雨，雖自知並非出什麽陽關，到底懷着向往的心情，也許不免是浪漫的罷，大行之名最初竟是有些嚇人，自然，這不免又和讀過的舊說部有關係。這且不提。</p>
<p>大行山，名字如此響亮，本身也自應偉大，此行將有不凡的遭遇也難說。譬如英雄仙俠之類，聽來皆足使人措愕，（在那時）大洪，少林，二百歲的老僧不是到處在出風頭嗎！所以事前毫無凖備，便請主人打電話要了車子來，因爲身外無物，連摒擋也不必，便動身了。眞是簡單得很。</p>
<p>車户是一位年近古稀的老者，據說又是職此業數十年的「行家」。車子就是所謂「轎車」，老殘遊記中常常出現的；南方人大槪缺這宗眼福，北方却有得是。不過近年來已竟不行了，有些地方業經代以汽車，人力車。雖然偏僻所在尙不少，但也只等「年光」將其收入史篇的了。車只管他名曰轎，却不是轎，除了車轅的木杆外，是找不出什麽類似點的。車兩輪，直徑約三尺餘，較之同軌的「太平車」以及也可以同軌的手推獨輪車已高明多了。上有蓬，拱形，外覆以帷，大似山水畫中小船的蔑蓬，只是矮小了些，所以無人在裏邊飲酒賞月，未始不可惜。所以名之爲轎車，我想大槪也曾在官塲中出過風頭，因爲字較轎簡便，只要套上一匹騾就成了，不必非四個人抬着不可。况且那二尺寛三尺長的包箱，要舒服，是只能一人獨佔的，平常人家辦不到。兼之篷外還有兩個位置，「裏（即左）首」是屬車伕的；「外首」，亦即所謂「𩣔榬」那地方自然歸抱「拜匣」的「二爺」。</p>
<p>這車子載重時要兩個至三個牲口拉，倘只坐人，大抵只套一匹壯騾。我坐的恰就是後者者「獨轅」。據鄕下人說，最闊綽的是「二套」，是中庸主義，我不以爲然。瞧，倘有一個跟丁「𩣔轅」，不很像後補道了嗎。至於必須「二套」，那已竟表示卸任了。</p>
<p>細雨紛紛落着，車帷外早加上一層油布，客人正不必擔心。車在沾沾的崗土路上走着，車户「𢖼兒兒」鞭策着馴騾，而騾也眞可稱得起馴，任怎樣牠是絕不發一步跑的；鞭子打下，牠只很不平的搖搖那雙大耳朶，鼻子裏迸出「特洛洛」的聲音，一逕不慌不忙的走去。對於沒有什麽急務要辦的人是很合脾味的，乘此機會可以流覽沿途景物。</p>
<p>遠山隱迷在霧裏。附近小嶺同矮崗在雨脚下起伏。道傍，麥田上凝着水珠，像滿綴了蚌珠的仙衣。村落霢朦。綠柳含烟。正是是清明前後時節，很宜有一座杏花村買酒的。路上全無人跡，凄清得很。倘是墨人騷客，自不妨推敲一番。無如可憐得很，腦子裏竟是乾的，寗有補天能乎，也絞不出一絲「詩腦汁」。也罷，留給後來者罷，好在我們並不缺少「朦朧派」的詩人。</p>
<p>車户同他的馴騾都那般斯文，把我悶住了。一路上車子軋軋響着，人已被搖昏，到站頭想來還遠，這是急也急不得的，便睡過去了。睡裏是否冷落了這幅現成的圖畫，不得而知，但被車户的叱咜聲驚醒來時，情形已大大不同。天上雖仍薄雲滿佈，然而雨已停止，小崗　也更加累贅而且煩瑣，大行主脈業已在望了。</p>
<p>車户停下車，到路傍石屋裏取火種，且順便問了路程，才知道這老「行家」也並不行，至少走這條道還得請敎人。這條路原是通山西的便道，所謂便道者，卽介乎大道同小徑之間的意思。這時已有幾位客倌從山上下來，有「　子」，也有擔子，大抵是到「底下」出脫的農產物。也有山西來的酒。</p>
<p>車子再走上去，可就不得了了，路上盡是拳石，騾不時打着滑跌，哪裏是走，簡直像爬，有時車户還得下去拖住牠走。至於車子，簡直是一副癆病骨架。發氣的軋軋着，全體抖動着，有時還要來一手武的，「康岔」一聲跳到路傍。這要留神腦袋。到山下時，已竟是鳥歸狗吠，將近黄昏了。</p>

<p>— 馬克特溫作立波譯</p>
<p>溪西耶·史密呂還有老鼠獵狗，有雛雄雞，有大雄猫和諸如此類的東西，你一輩子也數不完，隨便什麽東西你拿去和他賭，他總配得上你的。有一天，他捉到一個蛙，他拿回家去，說打算去敎育他，因此，足足三個月，他沒有做旁的事，只是坐在他的後院裏，在敎那蛙跳。而且，我也可以賭，他的確在敎他。他從他的背後小小一擊，第二刹那，你就可看着他像一個油炸餅一樣，旋在空中丨丨看着他翻一個觔斗，如果架的勢好，也許翻兩個。於是脚爪扁平地，無恙地落了下來。他呌他捕蒼蠅，使他不斷地實習，因此，只要他看見了蒼蠅，他就可以捕住。史密呂說：一個蛙最需要的是敎育，而且他差不多什麽都可以做的丨丨我相信他這話。呵我曾經看見過他帶了但爾，韋布斯托來到這裏丨丨但爾·韋布斯托是那蛙的名字丨丨放在這地板上，喚着：「蒼蠅，但爾，蒼蠅！」而你還沒有來得及䀹眼睛，他已經直跳上去，跳在那邊那櫃台上，纒住了一個蒼蠅，於是，像一塊泥土一樣地堅硬，重新撲下地板開始用他的後腿搔着頭的側面，漠不動心地，好像一點也沒有做過比一個蛙應做的更多的事一樣。你永遠不會看到像他這樣謙虚，這樣直率的蛙，雖然他是這樣一個天才。如果他被公道地放在平地上跳的時候，他能够比你所看到的一切他的同類動物都跳在得好。平地上跳，是他最拿手的一套，你知道；如果來那樣的比賽，史密呂會儘量豪賭。史密呂對於他的蛙是感到格外的驕倣的，他是對的，因爲一切旅行的，走遍了四海的人們都說他是比他們所見到一切的蛙都要優越。</p>
<p>史密呂把的這生物養在一個方格小盒裏，他常常携了他上城去和人家賭。有一天，一個人丨丨一個這幕地的過客，碰到他提了這小盒，和他說：</p>
<p>「你這盒子裏是什麽東西？」</p>
<p>史密呂，非常淡漠地的樣子，說：「也許，這應當是一個鸚鵡，或者應當是一個金絲雀，但都不是丨丨這只是一個蛙。」</p>
<p>這人取了他這盒子。仔細地端詳一番，說，「呵，這樣的。那末，他有什麽用？」</p>
<p>「他麽，」史密呂輕鬆地，毫不在意地說「他有一個用塲，我斷定丨丨他跳得過卡納華拉斯州一切的蛙。」</p>

<p>— 陳福煕</p>
<p>「田媽媽，你的鷄又大些咧！」</p>
<p>「又大些嗎？」</p>
<p>聽見人家說鷄兒大了，田媽媽是很高興的。她喜歡養鷄，每年養的鷄雛，都從自己的母鷄孵的，種氣比「火煏鷄」大。由母鷄孵的，拿到鎭上去，每隻小鷄可以賣到四百文，並且鎭上人都歡喜買，說這種小鷄，容易長大，不容易死。鷄賣得起，但田媽媽從不稀罕這三四百文。她看見自家的母鷄孵了鷄，快樂得什麽似的，如果呌她出賣，在田媽媽怎麽也捨不得，所以她的鷄雛一向是不賣的。七八個月的時間，田媽媽成天餵食料，理鷄塒，看管野狗，差不多沒有一刻不留心着這羣鷄。</p>
<p>「田媽媽，你的鷄又大些啦！」</p>
<p>她聽人這麽說，不期然的使她高興，有時候還當着人把鷄兒捉來秤：</p>
<p>「前五天，這隻蘆花鷄重二斤三兩，現在又重了六兩哩。」</p>
<p>秤着，田媽媽的臉上堆着笑了。</p>
<p>像田媽媽這樣愛鷄，比人家愛狗，愛花，愛鳥更專心。一年，她養了二十多隻童子鷄，不知怎樣被黄鼠狼咬死了五隻。那天清晨，在鷄塒口發現了五隻死鷄後，田媽媽竟嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來了，别人勸她也勸不住。以後，不經過她親自關上鷄塒門，連睏覺也不安心。</p>
<p>新鷄一到冬至邊，雄的會啼，雌的已經能生蛋了。田媽媽愛養鷄，又喜歡鷄兒生下來的鷄蛋。鷄一到生蛋那天起，田媽媽每天可以在鷄塒裏面拾到鷄蛋。盛在罎子裏，不等到沒錢用，也是不肯賣掉的。田媽媽雖愛養鷄，辛辛苦苦的把牠養到生蛋，啼曉，但她除掉吃幾個蛋，從不吃過鷄肉。她把鷄雛養大了，好像養大了自己的子女一樣，不願宰殺牠們，寗肯到年底賣給人家過年。</p>
<p>到年底，田媽媽家裏總比平日格外拮据，沒錢用，於是只得到鎭上去賣鷄。每年，只留下兩隻母鷄預備明春孵蛋，其餘的統通賣了。</p>
<p>「油鹽又沒有了···」</p>
<p>田媽媽發愁。</p>
<p>「米呢？」丈夫問。</p>
<p>「也快完了，只剩···」</p>
<p>「那麽明天賣鷄！」</p>
<p>田媽媽每一回聽到這句話，如同割她的心胆似的，覺得丈夫正是個殘忍的，冷酷的人；但爲了沒有油米，田媽媽也顧不得鷄，只有讓丈夫把鷄脚捆了，拿到鎭上去賣錢。</p>
<p>「喔喔喔······」</p>
<p>捆了脚的鷄兒呌。</p>
<p>田媽媽聽到鷄的慘呌，她的心双顫脆脆的痛起來了，似悼喪的老淚，便打她深深的眼潭裏掛到雙頰上。</p>

<h3 id="c287">和平與戰爭心理的測騐 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>東京朝日新聞載紐約特派員電稱，週刋雜誌文學評論及大學新聞編　　　恊會，爲明白美國學生對於現今世界情形之心理，舉行投票，結果所得，三萬二千五百票之中，贊成和平者佔多數。</p>
<p>這種心理的測騐，老實說一句，眞可謂多此一舉，因爲希望和平的心理，可以說凡有血氣之屬，莫不同然，主張戰爭而不希望和平的，祇有少數而又少數的幾位野心家，和一般武力主義，專門横行不法一切不顧的搗亂份子，有此念頭。</p>
<p>所以欲測騐和平與戰爭的心理，不但美國學生，結果所得如此，卽非學生的測騐，其結果亦必相同，不但美國，卽以現在好大喜功的德國和日本而論，倘然從一般普通國民心理上測騐起來，其結果所得，亦必無二致。</p>
<p>所以戰爭與和平的心理，本來用不着測騐，但是此次美國學生心理的測騐，還有較深而複雜的意義，其測騐的問題，共有五個，其最重要的便是下列三個，㈠問美國今後能不捲入戰爭漩渦乎？結果認爲有捲入戰爭漩渦者多數，㈡美國如受他國侵略，諸君願仗劍而起乎？贊成者多數，㈢主張應侵略他國乎？抑不應侵入他國乎？主張不應侵入者多數。</p>
<p>第一個問題，便是問倘然今後發生第二次世界大戰，美國應該加入和不應該加入？現在的結果，是主張加入的多數，這似與愛好和平的心理不符，但是要曉得現在的一個世界，便是强權的世界，萬一愛好和平，不去加入，第二步戰神就要降於到自己頭上來，所謂「殺以止殺」，亦是愛好和平必當採取的一種手叚，所謂「關門家裏坐，禍從天上來」，門羅主義的不適用於當今之世，其趨勢已可槪見。</p>
<p>美國如受他國的侵略應仗劍而起來抵抗乎？㈡美國應該侵略他國乎？抑不應該侵略他國乎？㈢此種問題，不必問諸明白理智的學生，卽以問諸二三尺的童子，也必乾脆地答曰「仗劍而起」「不應侵略」，這是爲何？這就呌做世界人類的一種公理和人道，假定抺煞此點，倒行逆施，雖也未必不可逞强一時，而其結果終歸於失敗，卽使不失敗，亦不過爲一個滅絕人道和破壞公理的國家，决不爲人所齒。</p>
<h3 id="c288">節日 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>情景顯然跟從前大大的不同了。</p>
<p>往時，每逢一個節期的來臨，人們是用着非常喜悅的心情去迎迓的。大家早幾日便忙碌着，凖備着過節的事。而到了節日那天，彼此都格外歡愉在做節，同時各各還招呼了幾個同好聚在一塊兒，儘情的喝酒尋樂。感到了每個佳節眞是最足遣娛身心的時日。</p>
<p>而每家店子都擠滿了人物，伙計忙得應接不暇，老闆坐在掌櫃裏邊笑嘻嘻摸着鬍子，就是沿街也同時密密層層的全攤着魚販擔子，人更像潮水似的湧來湧去。出門的時候是空着手的，但回來的時候沒有一個不是載着一身纍纍的過節的東西。</p>
<p>如今可就消失了這樣的熱鬧的情况了。</p>
<p>雖然魚販灘子照例的滿街擺着，店子的門照例的開着，人也還是照例的熙熙攘攘，來往着。可是人的表情却異樣了，都是陰沉沉的，好像永遠看不見笑影一樣；店子的門前冷落落沒幾個人，伙計閑得嗗悶，老闆已不再笑嘻嘻，而悶燥着縐着眉，而且時時嘆着氣。魚販擔子半天兒不有生意，每個主顧彷彿都忽然慳吝起來，爭貨價幾乎半隻銅子也不入鬆。結果還是往往跑了開去。</p>
<p>丨丨年頭不好啊！一天不如一天。</p>
<p>店主人和魚販主人都同時慨嘆着。</p>
<p>滿街上的行人一樣地擁擠，但大多是用着眼睛出來逛逛，空手出門空手回家的。</p>
<p>丨丨過節啊！</p>
<p>丨丨過什麽節，簡直是過難關吧了。</p>
<p>從前說着的聲音是嘹喨的，現在可低微下去，並且帶着幾許蒼凉之意。從前誰碰見誰都高興提一提，現在不止沒人願意提，甚至怕聽見這個聲音的。從前是想怎樣多買些東西過節，此刻則是打算如何的省儉，如果能够全都省了下來是更好的。一到了節日的近邊，許多債務就同時迫在跟前，大家的腦袋裏成四天在做着黄金夢，然而大家都沒生計做，半點入息沒有，可是每天吃的喝的不能不顧，已經壓得伸不直背脊，再加上節關的擔子壓上來，簡直連氣都伸不過來了。</p>
<p>被現實的痛苦鞭打着，日子一天比一天不易過，而且懷着恐慌的心緒摸着生活的襲擊。一個節來了，人們的心便一度隨着緊張，掙扎着勉强能够渡過，伸一伸氣，又是緊接在後頭的還節，無數的節日，在永遠地向人們施以兇很的無情的威嚇。</p>
<h3 id="c289">寂寞的歲月 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 代尼</p>
<p>在寂寞中生活，二十個寂寞的冬天送走了我的青春。</p>
<p>住在都市近郊，兩個寂寞的伴侶同居着；但是在落葉蕭蕭的秋天，寂寞的朋友離别我走了。過慣了寂寞生活，我又迎接這第二十一個寂寞的冬天。</p>
<p>朋友遺留在這裏的，是一張我們合攝的像片。</p>
<p>我習慣地對他瞥了一眼，丨我們能在寂寞中傳達彼此的意念，把籐製的圍椅移到火爐近邊，煮了一壼龍井茶。遊移的合上眼，彷彿寂寞的伴侶坐在我的對面；搖洩着腿，嚼着土耳其的烟味，熊熊的火熖吻着我，迷濛的拉回到菊花盛放時節。</p>
<p>（！爲我們新加的寂寞同志祝福，盡一杯吧！</p>
<p>從此在這寂寞的地窖中開放的燦爛之花。一隻依人的小鳥，把我們兩顆寂寞的心動搖了。</p>
<p>早上，向着黄金的陽光，我們揮着手在公共汽車站頭分别，繁重的工作彷彿减輕了似的，再向着黄金的陽光，帶了笑臉歸來。打氣爐上煮熟噴香的飯，親手製成各種菜肴，把生活打發得輕快，舒適。</p>
<p>明月當頭的晚上，踏着修長的影子，擋着秋風，遨遊於附近小河之畔。或者賃了一條小舟，月下泛舟，更把二十個寂寞的歲月像送走了我的青春一樣的打發開了。</p>
<p>在寂寞的記憶中，我要建立一個新生的第二十一個冬天。</p>
<p>開始做起甜蜜的夢！）</p>
<p>夢呵！</p>
<p>抛了燃蒂，回味着苦澀的土耳其味對坐是兩個寂寞的伴侶的合影。</p>
<p>「當你依戀着懷中小鳥的時候，曾否舉起酒杯來爲寂寞的老同志祝福？」</p>
<p>我寂寞的向着，自然是一個寂寞的答覆！</p>
<p>一陣瑣碎的聲音響了起來，是兩珠打在玻璃窗上，牠和着爐中的火燄奏起動人的音樂。喝着龍井茶，我勝利地笑了；在寂寞中討生活的人，早已剝奪了那種輕快，舒適的日子！</p>
<p>慢慢地玻璃窗上迷佈了霧氣，那鏘然的聲音彷彿就漸漸遠去似的。天上沒有月光，一片迷濛的黑夜未知是那樣一個世界？</p>
<p>寂寞的雨巷呵，送來了悽咽的歌聲，是一個丁香的姑娘嗎？</p>
<p>「是那個死了女兒的苦老頭子啊！寂寞的伴侶在我耳邊輕輕說。</p>
<p>眞的！那天泛舟歸來，我們會見他獨自拉着嘶啞的胡琴，用假嗓子唱起「正月裏來是新春」的孟姜女曲子。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>他告訴我們，他的伴侶丨一個丁香的如娘丨死了，獨個兒賣唱是寂寞的，而且做不到好生意呢！</p>
<p>我們的小鳥可憐他，送了他兩毛錢，說：「老頭兒，買一有錢牛肉，打一角錢麥酒來消遣這個寂寞的晚上罷！」</p>
<p>如今，這個苦老頭兒也增加了一個寂寞的冬天，用假嗓子唱着孟姜女的曲子。我想推開窗來，問他一聲遇見那個賜佈兩毛錢的小姑娘嗎？然而在這凄風苦雨中，你忍心聽一聽嘶啞的胡琴和着的「正月裏來是新春」的曲子嗎？</p>
<p>把頭靠在籐椅背上，燃起一枝捲烟。熊熊的火爐苦味的龍井已經被我佔有了，在你寂寞的生活中是够可以傲然於那個苦老頭子面前，他是過着兩倍於你的寂寞底歲月呢！</p>
<p>我又勝利地笑了！</p>

<h3 id="c291">河上夜話 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>航船進了内河，黄昏了：起了很濃的霧，五尺以外就看不見船隻了。船家小心，說本來是上燈前可以到的，現在外面起了那麽大的霧，對面看不見人，還有誰敢大着膽子開出去和别的船兒碰的？說小也是一夥兒性命哩，晚上就算歇上那麽一夜了，到天亮再走。</p>
<p>這麽着、我們便全得在船上過夜了。</p>
<p>聽着呼應的喊聲，船家把繩子着實地上了纜；便掇過柴來生火煮晚飯。大已完全黑透了，河面上籠住了一層濃霧，燈火在四處疎落地散綴着，像珠簾内的華炬，朦朧而嫵媚。船隻通常是三五隻聚作一夥，我們可以聞得船夫們隔了船閑談嘆息，雞犬與兒童的喧雜。岸上飄來了人的聲息，呌賣的聲息，車馬的聲息。隔着濃霧，還隱約能看得到一點房屋的輪廊，與　化了的燈火。　是死沉沉的，廣漠的河面也是死沉沉的，隔着分水綫，却孕育着一種抑鬱，一種消沈，一種疎淡與寂寞。</p>
<p>河面上括起風來了，悠悠地。蒼老的船家把熱騰騰的飯端進了艙，帶着小心的，頌讚的臉色讓客人吃過了飯，自已便和伙伴與孩子們到船頭上吃去了。</p>
<p>夜晚的風吹着呌人打抖，而夜晚的時光却也是够無聊的。同艙的乘客們呌船伙收拾清楚了晚飯的殘桌，便有的帶着老光眼鏡，從身上摸出了摺得小小的「繡像七美圖」來邊讀邊唱地看，有的拿出紙牌與象棋來凑着身子打賭，有的從包裹上剝下一張破報紙來翻覆地看，有的則從無聊中偶而幾個人的眼睛碰一起，一點頭，便上下古今地談起來了。</p>
<p>談起來了，可是全是那些呌人不快意的叙述呢：談着災荒的年頭，談着小村子的婦人家因爲斷了糧上吊的故事，談着壯年的漢子一批批給謀害死了的荒唐的慘劇，談着一天難做一天了的買賣，談着這「一代不如一代」的世界······</p>
<p>一個中年的布商，在枯槁的黄臉上刻了無數的條紋，眼睛因了兩三個夜晚的失眠而失了神的，在神往着一幕生活的苦難的時候，連發音的平衡都不能保持了，嘴唇抖動得像秋蟬的翅膜。</p>
<p>「這年頭，眞是活了多少年來也沒遇到過的：大顆兒的麥子種下田去也養不活人了，人便祇得好遠地從家鄕漂出去，漂出去，死活不知地；可是到頭來却迎著了更大的苦難啦，做買賣，做工，開作坊，樣樣都不成，人們的花樣鬧得太多啦，鬧來鬧去總是要鬧掉人家的老命。」</p>
<p>眼睛裏閃着煎熬的光：「市面又是那樣的壞　，老鄕，您想想，這年頭還有什麽路走得通呢！！不錯，也是五十開外的人了，還是不知道明天是死是活哩。喝，您瞧，天也變了。」</p>
<p>聲音，萎沈得像半點垂熄的油火，聽的人心上全是濕淋淋的，像吸了一腔的冷水，一些人的興緻是漸漸地枯萎下去了，大家默默地不作聲，像在思索一點什麽似的。</p>
<p>疎疎落落地，在霧中，外面下起雨來了，風從窗縫裏吹進來怪難受地。船家低低的在外面喊：「諸客人們早點安處吧，夜裏退了霧就要開船的，明早天不亮便到啦。」</p>
<p>大家都默無一聲的走到鋪上去了，心想：「要是霧早一點退就好了。」</p>

<p>計劃周詳秘密終難守</p>
<p>脫離銀幕十足做夫人</p>
<p>瑪格蕾蘇麗文（MargaretSullavan）和她的導演威廉懷勒（WilliamWyler）的「溜婚」本來是計劃週詳，萬無一失的。但是結果却出於他們二人意料之外。××他們本來想，在沒有宣佈以前，别人决不至於知道的，而他們决定了，在他們的新片“TheGoodFairy”完畢之後，携手出門蜜月的時候，就是他們婚姻宣佈的日子。這是他們的計劃。不想出了一個小小的岔子。當他們的秘密，洩露出外的時候，好萊塢不相信。那天是星期日晚上，有些坐在無綫電旁邊的人，祇聽見溫吉爾宣告一段極簡單的新聞，說是瑪格蕾蘇麗文和她的導演威廉懷勒已於今晨十一時，在宥馬地方結婚了。×××這段簡單的新聞，即使新婚的瑪格蕾和威廉聽見了，亦會驚異而不相信的，因爲他們相信，他們的秘密是無從洩露的。除了他們新夫婦之外，還有兩個參與機密的人，那就是威廉懷勒的律師，和瑪格蕾蘇麗文的一個閨中密友，但是他們决不會洩露這秘密的。那末怎麽會讓外面知道的呢？那就可以知道在新聞事業發達的美國，無論何事保守秘密的不容易了。×××按照他們的計劃，他們在星期六晚間工作完畢之後，就携手同溜，星期一回來照舊工作，可以使一個人都不知道。他們在星期六晚拍戲，直拍到星期日晨四時才完畢。在晨六時瑪格蕾威廉和威廉的律師，就坐了預先租定的十五座位的大飛機，向宥馬出發。他們三人之外，還有一個飛機師此外並無别人，帶露晨征，雲間日出，人間仙侶，傲遊天上，其樂當然不言而喻乎。×××在宥馬一切都極順當。牧師亦是預先安排好的。他們新婚夫婦，於禮成一吻之後，即携手重返飛機塲。在瑪格蕾重行跳進飛機的時候，飛機塲上另有一位女郎，正在候着另一飛機的降臨。她認識了那跳進飛機，和兩個男子絕塵而去的就是好萊塢的明星某某。她順口和飛機塲的職員說了一聲，於是消息就傳出去了！等到他們御風而行，飄飄欲仙的時候，電報綫和無綫電機，都在的的打打，忙亂的響起來了。×××瑪格蕾蘇麗文和威廉懷勒間的曼羅斯，是極迅速而靜默，事前絕沒有引起任何人的注意。外表上看來，他們是極不投合的。瑪格蕾雖然很佩服威廉懷勒導演的才能，但是在他們認識一年半之中，她的肯嫁給懷勒，就是她自己，都是意想不到的。他們在攝影塲上，常爲這個那個爭執著。瑪格蕾的性情，是很剛强的。她那口直心快的脾氣，想說什麽就說什麽。她最不喜歡夜中工作。她替懷勒起了一個諢號叫做貓頭鷹，因爲他喜歡夜中工作的原故。她又嫌懷勒工作得太慢，她說他永遠不會完成一張片子的。×××同時，她和珂琳穆亞的前夫，約翰麥考密克往來得很密切。她在攝影塲上從來沒有和她的導演，談過三句以上的話。她和一般工作人員，倒是談笑風生的很合得來。×××不過到最近，瑪格蕾才常常和她的導演在飯廳中同桌吃午飯，大半是導演先生滔滔不絕的談論，瑪格蕾是支　兀坐。靜聽着。不過人家總以爲他們談的是影片上的事情，絕不會想到他們之間，會發生愛情的。×××但是瑪格蕾的性情，忽然變改了。她對於夜中拍戲亦不再反抗了，常常興高彩烈地從黄昏拍戲，一直拍到天亮。這是連她自己都覺得難以相信的一件事。這樣下去，差不多有兩個星期之久。忽然有一天，她發現了她已經愛上了她的導演了，深深地墮入愛情之淵了。以後的事情，就不言而喻了。但是瑪格蕾是個一往無前的人。她旣嫁人就想生孩子。所以，她的脫離界影，而完全做成一位十足的夫人，亦是意中事也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c302">評「蠻女情深」 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Behold　My　Wife丨國泰</p>
<p>自「蝴蝶夫人」之後，這一位頗有東方婦人味兒的雪維亞雪耐便爲中國觀衆熱烈的注意，因此她的蠻女情深在新年中又哄動了上海的觀衆。關於她除了「蝴蝶夫人」之外，「妒花風雨」也是演得很好的，此外却沒有演技成功的作品。至於這一影片，她的演技也沒有什麽特長的，充其量只不過是盡職而已，因爲故事並有怎樣適合她的個性。</p>
<p>就這一影片來說，祇有那一個曼莉自殺的過程，寫得極好，這不管是空氣的佈置，塲面的處理，再由於安娜雪苔（AnnSheri　an）演技的優秀，（雖然戲並不多那一塲戲確是非常富於情感，成爲作品最優秀，最精采的部份，假使說這一影片頗有價値的話，那就祇有在這裏表現出來。</p>
<p>接上從少爺負氣出走家庭起，由家裏的門汽車的門，······很快的連寫幾個門，再用汽車和酒描寫他的流浪和自戕身體的心理變態的過程，也顯出導演的聰明。從開頭一直到少爺在酒店中遇雪維亞雪耐爲止，「蠻女情深」是很緊張的抓住了觀衆的心情，注意着以後的發展。可是事實上不是這樣，從此以後，劇的進展却是十分平庸。劇情的曲折抑揚，都是生硬，做作，也可以說簡直沒有了戲，而祇是故事的叙述。甚至於其中作爲最高之糾紛的，雪維亞雪耐覺察少爺丈夫並不是眞心愛她，而祇是將她作爲向家庭賭氣之工具的時候，（少爺不要她卸去印地安人裝束。）那一塲戲也是那般無力，而雪維亞雪耐的表演也是如此生疎。一直到雪維亞雪耐代人受罪入獄，少爺丈夫又良心的代妻受罪，更是不盡情理的爲故事而故事，其幼稚荒唐的程度，乃是無以復加的。</p>
<p>再就技巧方面來說，我們看到導演描寫劇中人個性，有些塲合頗有可取之處，如寫少爺的頑固的母親，他父親的庸碌，他姊姊的奸滑，以及雪維亞雪耐之印第安人的强悍而貞操的民族性，所表現出來的是母親的焦燥，需要酒精刺㦸，父親的忙亂，姊姊的冷言假笑，而雪維亞雪萊在爲少爺大胆的割子彈和大鬧火車站的時候，都有較好的描寫。但是她們却沒有一貫的描畫，愈到劇的後段，愈失去了原有的個性。這和不能一貫把握空氣一樣，顯示出導演和劇作者沒有深度的創造能力。</p>
<p>如上所述，這不是一部成功的作品，雖然其中自有其個别的成功之處，整個的說，頭重尾輕的毛病，它所給予人們的印象乃是非常脆弱的了。</p>
<h3 id="c303">評「月媚花嬌」 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>Flirtation　Walk丨丨大光明</p>
<p>從佛蘭克鮑才琪一貫的作風來觀察，「月媚花嬌」中的士兵狄克，努力向上，以自己地位卑下爲恥，而去軍校求深造，卒由下级士兵而擢爲軍校高材生，這種向上的精神，在ＦBorzage以前的作品中，就有過同樣的提示。然而「月媚花嬌」的故事却是庸俗的。</p>
<p>軍官的小姐愛上了下級士兵，使下級士兵發奮爲雄，極力向上爬，而和士兵小姐結婚，這種庸俗的觀念，幾乎使我們不敢相信是鮑才琪的作品。在前期作品如「七重天」，「安琪兒」等片中，所出現的人物是因貧窮而忿恨，結果是純情主義的在愛與　　中得着安慰。這種作風一直繼續下來，直到近來的「悽紅慘綠」，仍然是貧窮生活的繪畫，在慘酷的生活環境中，男女主人公爲着愛的純潔而苦痛的流着歡笑的眼淚。固然作者不能本質的發掘人生的悲哀，常以愛來溶和生活的苦惱，可是慘酷的描寫人生的煩惱，却是使人們爲之痛哭流涕的。但是作爲歌舞片的「月媚花嬌」，却沒有承繼以前的作風，這裏的純情的發現，是由於軍官小姐愛上了士兵的漂亮，再等着下級士兵高陞後，便和官佐解除婚約而和士兵結婚了。這裏的純情表現，眞是太庸俗了。難道我們還能够看到一點人生的悲哀麽？所謂愛情的超越一切的觀念，說明鮑才琪是漸趨平庸了。</p>
<p>退一步說，這裏的故事構成也是極不嚴密的。譬如狄克的好友調到上海去，除了接到狄克幾次信之外，幾乎沒有事做，以後相遇，也祇是極不重要的一塲戲，如此人物在戲中似乎是多餘的，而因此幾次中斷了主綫的發展。又如軍官小姐的未婚夫和狄克握手，讓未婚妻和狄克結婚，也是非常突然的，至少應當有未婚夫婦决裂的一塲。</p>
<p>不過，有幾塲戲確是十分好的，最主要的是所謂FlirtationWalk，那明媚的月夜，那清脆的歌聲，那嫵媚的舞蹈，那溫柔的調情，由於攝影的優秀，鏡頭角度的適當，畫面的構圖，當時的情調，都是非常美麗的。此外幾次的軍操，也極秀麗，在軍樂聲中，和上述的諸塲同樣令人神往。從這些地方，仍然充分說明鮑才琪手法的優秀，名導演的表現方法，到底不同凡響。</p>
<p>和其他的近期美國影片一樣，這裏是朝氣的，明快的，向上的，詼諧的，組織成這一可愛的悲喜劇。它使人們輕快和諧，然而就因爲如此，失去了鮑才琪一貫的嚴謹的内容，而沉着的情調，嚴肅的空氣在這裏是沒有了的。就旣成的歌舞片來說，這裏是相當地别開生面的獨具風格，至少它保存純樸的氣氛，不像「華清春暖」，「歌舞昇平」那般黄金氣味的濃厚，然而如上面所述，内容的决定，這一作品到底只是屬於平凡庸俗一類而已。</p>

<p>— 柳村</p>
<p>這使他的心粉碎了，他亦顧不到自己怎麽樣了。他的心和他的腦，一時都麻木了。當密司脫麥得斯東告訴他，要送他到倫敦，在麥得斯東股份開設的酒肆裏去作學徒的時候，他祇會一個字一個字的說話，語言都不能連串了。於是他不久就去到倫敦，做著麥得斯東格蘭特貝酒肆裏的學徒，那裏他可以有一碗飯吃，和幾個零用錢，以及一個睡的地方。</p>
<p>他在酒肆裏，每天在碩大無朋的木桶旁邊，　着他的小背，整天不住手的洗滌酒瓶。一班大些的孩子們，　惡他的君子熊度，時時刻刻地在嘲弄他，毫無樂趣可言。他在倫敦所得到的惟一的一些樂趣，就是和他的居停，密考伯的家屬的往還。他不久和密司脫和密昔司密考伯發生了眞摯的情感。他和他們的四個整天呌囂吵閙的孩子，亦很友愛，還有他們的一個沒有多大用處的僕人，克立佫，那是　羅克孤兒院裏領出來的孩子。</p>
<p>密考伯的家庭，是他生平所意想不到的。密考伯的那種人，亦是他所從來沒有看見過的。他沒有看見他的人之前，一定要先看過他的一隻長脚。因爲他常常從天窗裏爬進屋子，藉以避免被一般聲勢淘淘的，在門外討債的人看見了。但是他一看見大衛，就欣然地和他相見，伸出一隻粗肥的手來，和他握着。他掉頭看着密昔司密考伯，歡然地告訴她，他已和那家雜貨店「脫離了關係，」因爲他所希望得的佣錢，他們竟斬而不與了。</p>
<p>密昔司聽了，不覺哭喪着說道，「但是我的親愛的韋爾金斯的將來怎麽樣呢？如果我說我們還要話下去的話，你說我講錯了嗎？」密考伯就說道：「我的愛，你記住「否極泰來」四個字，就好了。我已經將各種事業的全部，通盤的籌劃了一下。我已選擇了製酒的行業。簡單地說，我已經繕寫了好幾封書函，寄給了各地重要的製酒家，陳述了我的資格，想爲他們而服務。一切細則，現在還沒有確定，但是，我深信，這裏面一定有些機緣發現的。」</p>
<p>在門外，一般債主喧呶着要密考伯還債，否則他們就要吃他的血。在門内，一般小孩子怪聲呌喊着，互相爭鬥着。克立格拿着一個油筒，喂東西給他們吃。但密考伯是一個永遠不變的樂觀者，看着他的小房客大衛，頗有顧而樂之的神氣。他靜待着任何機緣的發現。大衛和他們同居了幾個月，亦是很快樂的。他們使他忘記了他自己的愁苦的命運，和艱鉅的工作。但是他不蒙天佑，連密考伯的家屬，都被奪取了去。有一天中午，克里格帶給他一個惡消息。那天晚上，他發現了密考伯的全家，爲了負債不還，都被關在監牢裏了。</p>
<p>但是如果大衛以爲他們一定在愁苦悲泣的話，他是猜錯了，因爲大衛到監牢裏去看他們的時候，密司脫和密昔司密考伯，正在捧着一大碗的水酒慶祝哩。慶祝？不錯的，因爲他們被監禁了不久，密昔司密考伯的家族，就見義勇爲的來搭救他們，替他們償清了一切的債欵，并且答應了，要替密司脫密考伯在迫立未斯的稅關上尋二個位置。因此，密考伯覺得悠然自樂起來，好的幸福不久就要降臨了。密考伯當然是很快樂了，但是他們的遷徙，即使大衛喪失了他在倫敦，所僅有的幾個良伴，當他揮着手，將他們送走之後，他的一顆心，充滿了悲哀，他覺悟了他的遺世而孤立，舉目無所親的苦楚。（未完）</p>

<p>Committees Ma and Liu Report on Examination Process; Various Committee Members Dispute the Weight of Tax Rates</p>
<p>Result: Passed with Amendments Based on Examination Opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its regular meeting on the morning of the 8th. When deliberating the Exchange Transaction Tax Regulations, Ma Yinchu and Liu Zhendong first reported on the examination process and the reasons for amending the tax rates. In summary, they stated that with the exception of marketable securities, which are taxed ad valorem (according to value), spot transactions are tax-exempt, and short-term and long-term futures are taxed at different rates according to their severity. In addition, bid bonds, cotton, cotton yarn, and flour are taxed at one-twentieth of the respective handling fees in the original submitted table of handling fees for various traded goods. Furthermore, various grains under the category of miscellaneous grains, such as wheat, soybeans, red sorghum, bean cakes, and bean oil, are all necessities for agriculture, industry, food, or fertilizer, and taxation should be lighter. Therefore, according to the previous table standard, approximately one-fortieth should be collected to show differentiation. Subsequently, the clauses were discussed. The committee members had no objections to the tax system, but there was much debate about the tax rates, especially for bid bonds. Some advocated raising the tax rate, collecting 1.4 or 1 cent per bid bond, in order to crack down on speculative trading and increase national treasury revenue. Others advocated reducing the bid bond tax rate because China is a silver standard country, while foreign countries are on the gold standard, and the price of gold and silver fluctuates from time to time. Therefore, legitimate merchants engaged in international trade rely entirely on the protection of the bid bond exchange to avoid losses. Raising the bid bond tax rate would not prevent market speculation, but would only increase the burden on legitimate merchants. Still others believed that collecting transaction taxes could only slightly increase national tax revenue, but for the purpose of cracking down on speculation and not hindering the legitimate business of merchants, it would be better to amend the exchange law clauses, increase the margin requirement, and stipulate that both buyers and sellers pay a margin, the amount of which should not be less than 5% of the transaction amount. As a result of the debate, the majority of the committee members advocated adopting the examination opinion and collecting taxes lightly, and the clauses were amended and passed.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its fourth meeting on the morning of the 8th, attended by 68 committee members, including Zheng Hongnian.

It was resolved that the above two cases would be referred to the Foreign Affairs and Labor Law Committees for examination. 4) The Foreign Affairs Committee reported on the examination of the draft International Telecommunications Convention. It was resolved to approve the convention according to the examination report and attach a statement. 5) The Finance and Economics Committees reported on the examination of the draft Exchange Transaction Tax Regulations, which was resolved to be amended and passed at the third reading. 6) Committee members Shi Weihuan, Liu Zhendong, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Jianru, Zhang Zhihan, Di Ying, Liu Tong, Mei Shuzeng, Wang Bingqian, Zheng Gongxuan, and Zhou Yizhi proposed amending the Exchange Law clauses. It was resolved to refer the matter to the Finance and Commercial Law Committees for examination. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan amended and passed the Exchange Transaction Tax Regulations on the 8th, totaling nine articles, which stipulated the following tax rates: A. Marketable securities shall be levied according to the agreed price of the transaction. The amount within the price below 100 yuan shall be calculated as 100 yuan. Spot transactions are not taxed. For transactions with a settlement period of seven days or less, a tax of 0.04/10,000 is levied; for transactions with a settlement period of more than seven days, a tax of 0.07/10,000 is levied. B. Bid bonds of 312.50 grams each, with a fineness of 978, are taxed at 7 cents in national currency. C. Cotton is taxed at 45 cents per 100 dan in national currency. D. Cotton yarn is taxed at 1.75 yuan per 100 bales. E. Flour is taxed at 35 cents per 1,000 bags. F. Miscellaneous grains such as wheat, soybeans, and red sorghum are taxed at 35 cents per carload. Bean cakes are taxed at 20 cents per 1,000 pieces. Bean oil is taxed at 20 cents per 100 dan. Furthermore, if the exchange fails to report or pay taxes in accordance with Article 4, or violates the stipulated deadline, or if there is concealment or falsehood in the report, a fine of up to 500 yuan shall be imposed. If taxes are evaded as a result, in addition to collecting the tax amount that should have been paid, a fine of 10 to 30 times the evaded tax amount shall be imposed. Furthermore, if the types of traded goods are increased or changed, the tax rates shall be revised in accordance with legislative procedures to collect transaction taxes. In addition, for transaction taxes in places where exchange tax supervisors have not been established, the Ministry of Finance may entrust local financial institutions or banks to collect and remit the taxes on its behalf.

<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the examination of the International Telecommunications Convention, with the following results: 1) This convention is a merger of the St. Petersburg Telegraph Convention and the Washington Wireless Telegraph Convention. Both conventions have been acceded to or ratified by our country. Although this convention has been slightly added to and supplemented, the content is generally appropriate. Twenty-nine countries have now ratified this convention, and four countries have declared accession. It seems that we can approve it. 2) Among the contracting countries of this convention, the leased territory of Kwantung is also included, which is the same as the situation of the Washington Wireless Telegraph Convention. When our country ratified that convention, it had an attached statement. Therefore, when approving this convention, a supplementary statement may be added as usual, as follows: The National Government of the Republic of China, when ratifying this convention and recognizing the subordinate rules, formally declares that the National Government of the Republic of China does not recognize or grant any foreign country or its people the right to install or use wired and wireless equipment in the leased territory, residential area, concession, embassy area, railway area, and other similar areas without the express permission of the National Government. Anything recorded in this convention and its subordinate rules that involves the leased territories, whether explicitly stated or implied, shall not have any impact on Chinese sovereignty. The plenary session of the 8th has passed the original examination report. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>Estimated 655 Million Rubles, Revenue and Expenditure Balanced with a Surplus</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, 32 committee members have been appointed to revise the Soviet Constitution, with Stalin as the chairman of the committee. According to the Finance Commissioner Grinko's report, the Soviet financial situation is becoming more stable. Although the 1935 budget has increased the huge amount of national defense expenditure, it is still expected to have a surplus of 500 million rubles. The estimated revenue is 65,700,000,000 rubles, and the expenditure is 65,200,000,000 rubles. The national defense expenditure this year reached 6,500,000,000 rubles due to the increase in army food prices and the expansion of the military strength. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) At the first plenary meeting of the Soviet Central Executive Committee, Finance People's Commissar Grinko reported, "The Soviet national budget has increased four and a half times in the past four years, from 12 billion rubles in 1929-30 to 53.7 billion rubles in 1934. During these four years, a total of 151 billion rubles has been used for socialist construction. Among the countries in the world whose budget can expand so much and have such a surplus, only our Soviet Union. This is the result of the victory of socialism, the development of the socialist economy, and the increase in the welfare of the working masses."</p>
<p>This can be seen from the strengthening of Soviet currency circulation and the increase in the ruble exchange rate. As of January 1, 1935, the amount of currency in circulation nationwide decreased by nearly 700 million rubles compared to January 1, 1933, while the sales volume of commodities increased by 46% in two years. In addition, the accumulation of industrial profits in 1934 also increased to 7.5 billion rubles due to the reduction in production costs and the improvement of labor productivity. We have successfully expanded the concentration of national savings in the form of government bonds and savings bank deposits. The number of national bond holders has increased from 8 million</p>

<p>(Moscow) The current Soviet Central Executive Committee has recently been elected. At the first plenary meeting, the committee elected 27 members of the Standing Committee and 24 alternate members. Among the members are Stalin, Kalinin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, etc. Kalinin, Petrovsky, Chervakov, Motsanbekov, Khodzhayev, Aitakov, and Ragimbayev were appointed as Chairmen of the Soviet Central Executive Committee, Yezhov was the secretary. At the same time, the Soviet People's Committee was organized, Molotov was appointed as chairman, and Chubar, Rudzutak, and Mezhlauk were appointed as vice-chairmen.</p>
<p>The heads of each People's Commissariat are as follows:</p>
<p>Litvinov: People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Voroshilov: People's Commissar for Defense</p>
<p>Yezhov: People's Commissar for Internal Affairs</p>
<p>Rosengolz: People's Commissar for Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Ordzhonikidze: People's Commissar for Heavy Industry</p>
<p>Lobov: People's Commissar for Timber Industry</p>
<p>Lyubimov: People's Commissar for Light Industry</p>
<p>Mikoyan: People's Commissar for Food Industry</p>
<p>Veitser: People's Commissar for Domestic Trade</p>
<p>Chernov: People's Commissar for Agriculture</p>

<p>The meeting also retroactively appointed Mezhlauk as Chairman of the State Planning Commission and Kuzkaev as Chairman of the Budget Commission. The Constitution Commission responsible for drafting the new Soviet Constitution has also appointed 31 members, with Stalin as the chairman and Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Chubar, Litvinov, etc. as members. The commission is responsible for revising the current Soviet Constitution and submitting the revised articles to the Standing Committee of the Soviet Central Executive Committee for approval. Before the end of the first plenary meeting of the Central Executive Committee, Finance People's Commissar Grinko reported on the Soviet Union's unified budget for 1935. (TASS, 8th)</p>
<p>increased to 45 million, and the number of savings bank depositors has reached 35 million, with a total deposit of 1.6 billion rubles. All of these can indicate the improvement of the people's material life and their trust in the Soviet currency. The government has decided on the national budget for 1935, with 65.7 billion rubles in revenue and 65.2 billion rubles in expenditure. Of the total increase in the budget compared to the previous year, 7.2 billion rubles will be allocated to investment in the national economy, 1.5 billion to cultural construction, 1.5 billion to national defense, about 4 billion to supplement local budgets, and 2 billion for strengthening the credit of the national bank.</p>
<p>"The expenditure on social and cultural facilities has greatly increased, from 11 billion to 15 billion rubles. For example, healthcare expenditure has increased by 45% compared to 1934."</p>
<p>When Mr. Grinko mentioned the increase in national defense expenditure, he said, "The national defense expenditure in 1934 greatly exceeded the planned amount (1.665 billion), reaching 5 billion rubles. The reasons for this are: first, the prices of materials and machinery used by the Red Army increased due to the abolition of the ration system; second, the expansion of the Red Army; and third, the production cost of heavy industry (which has completed the Red Army's technical equipment plan) slightly exceeded the estimate. The national defense expenditure of our country in 1935 is set at 6.5 billion rubles, but the expenditure of the Soviet Defense Committee in the national budget is still far lower than the military expenditure of capitalist countries." At the end of his speech, Mr. Grinko strongly stated that the Soviet ruble and the entire financial system are becoming stronger and stronger, and at the same time, it is not necessary to borrow high-interest loans from foreign countries to build a socialist economy.

<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi Explains at Budget Meeting</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi explained the following regarding the air defense issue in response to Mr. Sanjinosuke Nakamura's question at the 4th Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee today. Under the new demands for the Showa 10th year, 36 million yen is included in the emergency air defense equipment improvement expenses. The Army has this stage for establishing a certain level of goal for national defense aviation and air defense, and this item is requested to achieve this goal. Regardless of the state of national finances, it is really necessary for national defense. Therefore, increasing aviation expenses in the future is inevitable. However, depending on the financial situation, if there is a reduction in the aviation and air defense budget, the military must fill this expense even if it cuts other budgets. In addition, the increase in air defense-related expenses is also very large for the air defense of "Manchukuo," and the reason for this can be cited as the situation of the Soviet Union's expansion of armaments in the Far East. In addition, in order to expect the perfection of our country's air defense, the government is currently urgently formulating air defense regulations, which can be realized recently. The cultivation of national air defense knowledge and aviation equipment will naturally also be included in the air defense regulations. (Domei, 8th)</p>

<p>Not Restricted by the Washington Treaty, Japan Wishfully Hopes to Open Negotiations</p>
<p>(Washington) Non-official circles in Washington do not want to attach importance to the news reported by the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun that Japan intends to negotiate a treaty to not establish defenses on the Hawaiian Islands and Singapore. The newspaper stated that although the agreement was initiated by Japan, it recognizes Japan's establishment of defenses in its Pacific territories. Unofficial sources commented on this, saying that it was completely unfounded. This place does not believe that Japan intends to actively conclude the treaty. Well-informed sources declared that the reasons given by the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun were completely wrong, because the newspaper assumed that Hawaii and Singapore were within the scope of the Washington Treaty, but in fact, the above bases and Alaska have special provisions and are not restricted by the treaty. Although the news published in the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun has not been officially confirmed as stated by Japanese Navy Minister Osumi, it has aroused a lot of criticism here. It is said that the Washington Treaty stipulates that Britain and the United States can freely establish defenses in Hawaii and Singapore, but the Japanese islands west of the Hawaiian Islands and the American territories are within the scope of the treaty. American officials are quite concerned about the statement that Japanese bases are purely defensive in nature, while British and American bases are offensive. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, Japanese Navy Minister Osumi Mineo issued a declaration, intending to ask Britain and the United States to stop or restrict the defensive works of the Singapore naval base and the Hawaiian Islands.

<p>Hailar</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Yamamoto Isoroku, the representative for the London Naval Disarmament Conference, is hurrying back to his country via the Siberian Railway. Yesterday, a reporter visited him in his carriage. He told the reporter, "The preparatory meeting has now adjourned, and there are different opinions on its harvest. Personally, I cannot simply say. The next meeting will be decided according to Japan's intentions. Britain and the United States are passively on the defensive. The positions of the three countries have not been understood in substance. If there is an opportunity, I intend to make further efforts to understand each other. However, I cannot doubt whether the positions of Japan and the United States can be reconciled. It cannot be clarified until the representatives of the two countries return home to report and decide on a policy. Not only the timing of the reunion, but also whether the formal meeting can be held is still unclear. Britain and the United States' shipbuilding plans are to supplement the treaty volume up to today. It is very clear that even if the meeting is not held afterwards. As for the technical aspect, the issue of reducing ship types, Japan's position is in the middle of Britain and the United States, so we do not consider this a problem. On the contrary, there are difficult ship types and quantities between Britain and the United States, which must be considered together. Britain and the United States' recognition of Japan's military equality is between recognition and non-recognition, so the result of the conclusion and consultation can be said to be a failure, but it is not a complete failure. There are considerable points of agreement. Because I need to return home urgently, I am going via Siberia, and I plan to return to Kyoto from Shenyang on the 12th." (Dentsu, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Lord Lytton Strongly Advocates British-American Cooperation Against Japan <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Delivers Speech in New York</p>
<p>(New York) Lord Lytton delivered a speech to the Political Education Federation today, stating that the Manchurian problem is the most important issue in the minds of the three powers participating in the current naval talks. The problem may not have been openly discussed until now. Lytton's speech caused some excitement, because Lord Lytton was the chairman of the League of Nations' committee to investigate Japan's occupation of Manchuria, so discussing this complex issue may be more competent than others. Lytton said that Japan's purpose of insisting on naval equality is to demand recognition of the status quo created by it. If it cannot achieve this purpose, it is determined to resist external pressure. Therefore, Japan demands naval equality with other countries, and at the same time expresses that if the powers recognize the "Manchukuo" handled by it, Japan can also express its willingness to compromise. The purpose of this policy is to arouse suspicion between Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States are both aware of this temptation, so they are all vigilant, fearing that the other party will be bewitched by it. Britain and the United States both want to avoid competing with Japan in building ships, but industrialists in both countries are pressuring the government to seek preferential treatment in "Manchukuo." The two countries are always suspicious, fearing that the other party will act alone and exchange this benefit. Lytton's talk aims to promote British-American friendship. During the speech, he considered the Far East problem to be one of the political problems, and the people of Britain and the United States should have a frank discussion. Lytton continued, "Japan initially recognized the atrocities in Manchuria as legitimate actions, and then abolished the Washington Naval Treaty. The original state of the Far East has been completely destroyed. However, serious political problems have arisen from this, and not only China and Japan are affected, because the original state of the Far East is clearly stipulated in the international agreement, and Britain and the United States are the signatories of the agreement. Therefore, the situation caused by Japan's violation of the treaty is enough to endanger world peace. If you want to deal with this crisis, British-American cooperation is essential. Common dangers are enough to make us cooperate, but looking at the situation, there are also factors that separate us. The Far East problem is based on the following two principles: ㈠ The economic needs of the Japanese people after the increase, ㈡ China's political reform and its gradually prospering industry, but when Britain and the United States deal with this problem, they do not forget to maintain peace, abide by international obligations, preserve commercial opportunities, and prevent naval competition with huge costs. In the case of Britain, British-Japanese friendship makes the British sympathize with Japan's economic situation, which makes the Americans suspicious of British words and deeds. In the case of the United States, Britain is a member of the League of Nations, but the United States is not, which makes the British unable to trust the intentions of the United States, and is also suspicious of the extent to which Americans are willing to take responsibility for solving the Far East problem. But all suspicions are unfounded, because both Britain and the United States have obligations and are bound by treaties." (National News Agency, 7th)</p>

As a result of discussing the issue of kerosene storage obligations with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, they put forward the following conditions: ㈠ Extend the completion deadline for oil storage facilities, ㈡ Reduce the oil storage obligation period from six and a half months to three and a half months, ㈢ The Japanese government bears an economic value of 6% per year for the oil storage equipment cost and the oil storage amount, as well as other expenses, ㈣ Approve the gasoline price increase. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided on the first three conditions: ㈠ The Kerosene Industry Law is one of Japan's national defense policies, and its implementation period cannot be postponed at all, ㈡ The reduction of the oil storage obligation amount cannot be handled for the same reason as the previous item, ㈢ The government has financial difficulties and cannot bear the expenses, and the fourth condition is agreed to be accepted, so this problem is completely settled and a compromise is reached. The price increase of gasoline will be announced soon, but consumer opposition is inevitable. (Domei, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Humble Opinion on Agricultural Revival <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The disaster is coming. Those who are most affected are the farmers. Therefore, those who speak of relief should take the farmers as the main target. The methods of relief are generally divided into three types: emergency relief (i.e. voluntary relief), work relief, and agricultural relief. The steps for providing relief are to prioritize emergency relief and work relief, and then follow up with agricultural relief. Identify the old, weak, women and children who cannot survive without relief, and provide food, clothing, or money based on the number of people to save them from the ravines. This is emergency relief. Select young and strong people to build roads, dredge rivers, repair embankments, and reclaim wasteland in the disaster area, so that they can earn a living through work. This is work relief. The effect of work relief is enough to maintain the dignity of those who receive relief, and also use their energy to plan construction for the local area. Therefore, money is not wasted, and effort is not wasted. However, in addition to emergency relief and work relief, if there is no agricultural relief to follow up, it cannot be thorough. Agricultural relief involves providing seeds, fertilizers, etc., or lending money to disaster-stricken farmers to help them restore their livelihoods and production capacity, so as to complete the effects of emergency relief and work relief and achieve the ultimate goal of relief. Without this, although disaster-stricken farmers can temporarily maintain their lives through emergency relief and work relief, once the money runs out and the relief stops, they will inevitably have to migrate to all directions, causing the fields to be barren and irreparable. Therefore, in terms of humanitarianism and economics, the importance of agricultural relief is the greatest of the three. In the entire plan to relieve disaster-stricken farmers, it is the most important and indispensable step.</p>
<p>Last year, there was a severe drought that caused a disaster. According to the Disaster Relief Committee's investigation, the disaster-stricken fields totaled more than 133.3 million acres, making it the largest disaster since the Yangtze River flood twenty years ago. Although the central government has not established a special agency to take charge of the relief work, Shanghai has a Committee for Raising Drought Relief Funds for Various Provinces, a semi-official organization composed of leaders from the national charity community and central government officials, to preside over the matter. It is actively proceeding. However, according to the news of the association published in various newspapers, since its establishment in October, it has collected less than 500,000 yuan in donations. The central government has allocated 550,000 yuan, making a total income of about 1 million yuan. The association plans to allocate about 1 million yuan for emergency relief. If emergency relief is followed by agricultural relief, where will the money for agricultural relief come from in the future? With such a vast disaster area, 1 million yuan is not enough to handle emergency relief, and the money needed for agricultural relief is even more enormous. Now, let's assume that 20% of the number obtained by the aforementioned Disaster Relief Committee is the most severely affected area, which should also be around 30 million acres. Taking the seed item as an example, each acre requires about 3.5 liters of seeds, which requires 1 million dan, or more than 7 million national currency. Can this be obtained through fundraising or met by the national treasury? This is truly enough</p>
<p>to make us worry endlessly.</p>
<p>The only ones who possess huge sums of money to lend to the society and the country for various huge funding needs are the financial circles. If financiers can lend money to farmers in the disaster area, so that they can purchase seeds and engage in spring plowing, then restoring the countryside would truly be twice the result with half the effort. Disaster-stricken farmers can save themselves without waiting for relief. What all the people of our country have been thinking about day and night is to find a complete solution. These hopes and encouragement have also been seen in newspaper editorials, meetings, and discussions. Financiers have also never lacked this idea, given the expansion and congestion of urban finance. However, they are still hesitant and unwilling to move forward. Farmers still have no way to borrow money and sigh with regret while looking at their fields. Why? Because the financial industry itself is based on profit. Investment and lending require stability and security. How can they take the shareholders' blood and sweat for a risky attempt? Therefore, those who lend money to merchants must have long-term credit or reliable collateral. Those who invest in the countryside must have a cooperative organization or have agricultural products that can be used as collateral. Now, if you lend money to the poor people in the disaster area, who have no organization and no possessions, what is the danger they bear? Even if it is verified that the borrowing farmers are indeed using the borrowed money for cultivation, just like merchants are indeed using it for profit-making commercial activities, the success of agricultural production depends half on human effort and half on the weather. How can we predict in advance whether there will be a good harvest in the future? This is the first thing to worry about. Even if there is a good harvest, if we encounter the same situation as last year's cheap grain hurting farmers, and the income does not cover the principal, what will the farmers use to repay the borrowed money? This is the second thing to worry about. All of these are things that the financial industry must consider in order to maintain its own stability and business interests. We should empathize and have the same feelings. Therefore, the problem of solving agricultural relief lies in solving how to reduce the risk of lending money in disaster-stricken rural areas.</p>
<p>Now that we know that relieving disaster-stricken compatriots and helping them restore their livelihoods is the responsibility of the entire country, and should not be assigned to any individual to be solely responsible for, and in fact only the financial industry has this courage, then the method of solving agricultural relief may lie in combining the strength of the government and the financial industry to move towards it together. What we call the method, concretely speaking, is that the financial industry lends money to farmers in the disaster area, and the government is fully responsible for guaranteeing the principal and interest of all loans. The financial industry should lend money to farmers in a business-like manner and continue to do so. It should see that the borrowed money is indeed used for spring plowing. Those with assets should provide collateral, and those who are extremely poor should have several people provide joint guarantees. And the government should be the guarantee for their loans, guaranteeing the repayment of the principal and interest. All parts that farmers cannot repay due to natural disasters or human affairs should be borne and compensated by the government. If this is done, the government will not need to immediately raise and spend huge sums of money. The financial industry will obtain a stable and safe investment market, and the disaster-stricken farmers will have the hope of restoring their fields. One action has great benefits. From the government's standpoint, it can be said to be changing the previous method of agricultural relief, without giving or abandoning, but using the country's financial resources to provide a strong guarantee, attracting the financial industry's money to help disaster-stricken farmers restore production. There is no appearance of relief, but the actual effect of relief is obtained. This is truly the best method in a desperate situation. Furthermore,</p>
<h3 id="e38">Italy Expresses Dissent to the Sky Mutual Assistance Pact <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Scope of Implementation Limited to Western Europe, Italy's Participation Yields Little Benefit</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to a reliable dispatch from the Rome correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt today, regarding the Anglo-French agreement concluded in London, concerning the five-nation Sky Pact among England, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy, the Italian government has sent a note to England and France expressing its dissent and proposing a counter-proposal. This move is quite unexpected.</p>
<p>According to another report from Rome, it is said that the Italian government intends to make a decision on joining the Sky Pact only after the German government responds to the Anglo-French agreement concluded in London. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome – A Berliner Tageblatt reporter reports that he has received information from reliable sources stating that the Italian government has notified the French and British governments through diplomatic channels that, after a preliminary review of the proposed Sky Pact, the Italian side has certain objections to its form. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing to submit a memorandum listing its differing views and proposing a counter-proposal. One of the most important points is that all five signatory countries of the Locarno Pact should join the Sky Pact, enjoying and undertaking the same rights and obligations. According to the reporter, the Roman view is that the aerial pact to which Italy has been invited to participate is merely a one-sided arrangement, and Italy feels that the gains do not outweigh the losses. As for Sir John Simon's explanation that Italy's interests are too small geographically speaking, it is not enough to convey Italy's ideals. Furthermore, in the eyes of the authorities in Rome, this aerial pact should not be discussed outside the general security issue, because in the event of war, this pact would certainly not be limited to the air force. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government's reply to the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 has not yet been received here. It is generally believed that it is unwilling to participate in the Sky Pact, which is a fact, because the scope of implementation of the Sky Pact is limited to Western Europe, and Italy's borders are not within the scope of protection. According to news from the capitals of Central and Eastern European countries, Germany's former allies may take the opportunity to revise the German military system to demand that all military provisions in the various peace treaties related to those countries be declared invalid. British officials are unwilling to consider this matter at this time, because the current urgent task is to resolve the German military issue in accordance with the aims of the Anglo-French Declaration.

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon flew to Paris today to attend a banquet of the British Chamber of Commerce and will return to England tomorrow. Sir John Simon's trip to Paris was arranged weeks ago and is unrelated to the Anglo-French agreement signed last Sunday. However, Sir John Simon will take this opportunity to meet with the French Foreign Minister in Paris. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The British and French Chamber of Commerce in Paris is scheduled to hold its annual banquet tomorrow, chaired by Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon. French Prime Minister Flandin and Minister of Commerce Marchandeau have also been invited to attend. Marchandeau will also deliver a speech. This afternoon, Sir John Simon met with Italian Ambassador Grandi, who explained the Italian government's views on certain points in the Anglo-French Declaration. It is reported that Italy suggests that the mechanisms of various conventions (referring to the Sky Pact, the Danube Convention, and the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact) should be simple, so that various conventions can be included in the same diplomatic document. It is likely that Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon will be able to inform the French government of Italy's views after arriving in Paris. The Foreign Secretary is scheduled to make a short stay in Paris and return here on Saturday. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>To Exchange Views with France via Diplomatic Channels First</p>
<p>(Paris) The German Ambassador to France, Köster, has recently returned to his post from Berlin. However, because Foreign Minister Laval is still recovering from a minor illness, it is difficult to predict when he will meet with Köster. It is reported that Köster did not bring instructions from the German government when he came to France, but only exchanged information with the French government through diplomatic channels. It is generally speculated that the proposals in the Anglo-French London Declaration are likely to be accepted by Germany, namely: 1) Abolishing the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles; 2) Concluding a five-nation Sky Pact, which would allow Germany to have a strong air force; 3) Fully recognizing military equality. However, although Germany hopes to obtain the above three benefits, it is still willing to re-attend the League of Nations and is unwilling to conclude the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. According to sources in Berlin, Hitler has decided not to receive guests within ten days due to important political talks. These political talks are undoubtedly a detailed study of Germany's various issues regarding the Anglo-French proposals. In addition, rumors from London that France is issuing French loans in the London market are completely unfounded. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>Not Appropriate to Delay and Miss the Opportunity</p>
<p>Anglo-French Agreement Opens the Path to Disarmament</p>
<p>丨British Prime Minister Delivers Speech丨</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald delivered a speech today at the Luton Bedford National Government Propaganda Conference regarding the recent Anglo-French talks, stating, "The demands put forward by both Germany and France have made it impossible for the other party to accept while maintaining their national integrity. The crux of the matter lies here. When we held talks, we took into account the demands of both sides. Now we have</p>
<p>Attached are several outlines to reveal it:</p>
<p>1.  The government investigates and announces the counties and districts most severely affected by the disaster.</p>
<p>2.  In the areas most severely affected by the disaster announced by the government, if financial institutions lend money to farmers, or if other organizations engage in direct lending to farmers engaged in farming, the government shall be responsible for guaranteeing the principal and interest of the loan.</p>
<p>3.  When financial institutions lend money to farmers, they must investigate and ensure that the loan is used for spring plowing, or that the organization is indeed re-lending to disaster-stricken farmers engaged in spring plowing.</p>
<p>4.  Loans may be substituted by seeds at a price.</p>
<p>5.  Loans should be handled according to ordinary procedures. If there are mortgages available, take the mortgages. If there are insufficient or no mortgages, a joint guarantee of five or more people should be provided.</p>
<p>6.  If the grain price is unusually low during the autumn harvest and farmers are unable to repay their debts, the government may purchase it at a high price so that they can repay the loans.</p>
<p>7.  If there is a natural disaster or man-made misfortune that leads to a crop failure, or other personnel relations, that result in the inability to repay part or all of the loan, the cleaning committee organized by the government and representatives of the financial industry will investigate the facts, and the government will allocate funds to compensate for it.</p>
<p>8.  The part compensated by the government is still the responsibility of the farmers. However, the financial industry continues to lend money with the government's guarantee, so that they can continue to farm and pay off the debts in the future.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the people for disaster relief seems to be far less than in the past. As evidenced by the fact that the Drought Relief Committee's efforts over four or five months have raised less than 500,000 yuan, while during the flood of 20 years ago, the people's donations to the Flood Relief Committee reached 1 million yuan within a week. This can be seen. In recent years, the social and economic situation has been far less than in the past, or it may be one of the reasons. And the impact of the drought is not as obvious as the flood for those who live in the cities. In fact, the suffering of the drought is getting deeper and deeper. The family suicide of farmers reported in the newspapers is still not one in ten thousand. As the spring plowing period has arrived, for the sake of humanity, for the country, for ourselves, the policy of agricultural revitalization can be carried out at this moment.</p>
<p>France jointly issued a declaration, and the various proposals it made are now being considered by the German people. I hope that the final result is that Germany can re-attend the League of Nations and implement its various demands, and France can discuss security measures with Germany in the League of Nations. After this consultation, the road to international arms agreements, which had been blocked before, can be repaired again, and all nations can move forward together to achieve lasting peace. I have high hopes for this," he said. When the Prime Minister mentioned the draft Sky Pact, he said, "We must not delay and act slowly, so as to miss the opportunity and allow aggressive countries to take advantage of the gap. On the contrary, after the Sky Pact is established, aggressive countries will know that once they send aircraft to attack one of the signatory countries, the other signatory countries will rise up and resist together. They will certainly be more cautious and dare not act rashly. From this point of view, the Sky Pact is the most effective method of diplomacy for all countries to prevent aggression. The cause of peace has thus made great progress, and war will no longer be possible. Even if war breaks out, we will not be isolated and helpless. In 1924, the principles on which the Geneva Protocol was based (before the Locarno Pact, it was proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot, and its content stipulated that if France was attacked by Germany, Britain would provide assistance. This protocol was later rejected by the British Parliament and ultimately became invalid.) is the same as the Sky Mutual Assistance Pact, so the Labor Party approved it. Moreover, these principles have been revised and adapted to the modern situation. We can now announce to the public, especially to mothers, that the Sky Mutual Assistance Pact is used to avoid war, and its effectiveness is unprecedented, and you can also believe that the children you have worked so hard to raise will not have to be conscripted into war to sacrifice their lives in the future."

At that time, the vast majority of those who support the Anglo-French agreement will be in the majority. Generally speaking, a small number of right-wing Conservative MPs will oppose the principle of Britain adopting a broader commitment on the European continent. Liberal and Labour MPs will only demand that the government provide guarantees so that the various conventions proposed by Britain and France (referring to the Sky Pact, the Danube Convention, and the Eastern Mutual Assistance Pact) will not hinder the progress of disarmament.

<p>Instructs Congressional Leaders to Take Emergency Steps</p>
<p>(Washington) Attorney General Cummings, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and other government leaders, after meeting, told the Associated Press that the government is prepared to deal with any unexpected events after the ruling in the Gold Bond Case. Since the Supreme Court accepted the Gold Bond Case, Cummings has consulted with President Roosevelt, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Treasury Advisor Klein, and other key figures on the steps to be taken after the government loses the case. Cummings today carefully avoided answering any questions related to this conversation. The government is now instructing the leaders of both houses on the six emergency laws to be proposed after the Supreme Court issues a ruling in favor of the government. The Associated Press learned that when Treasury Secretary Morgenthau went to Plainsboro at the end of the week, he handed a six-page memorandum to the White House spokesman for Congress with these instructions. Although the government believes it can obtain a favorable ruling, it hopes that the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives understand the necessary measures to deal with emergencies. Congressional leaders said yesterday that the Department of Justice is drafting a bill to be submitted to Congress for discussion immediately when the government loses the case. When the court will issue the ruling is still unknown. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Clear as If Only Six Thousand Miles Apart</p>
<p>(London) There are two banquets today, one held in London and one held in Cape Town, six thousand miles apart. At the same time, key members of the gatherings delivered speeches to the crowds through wireless telephone. On one side, Colonial Minister Thomson, Postmaster General Hooton, and others sat around a table at the Hyde Park Hotel. On the other side, South African Prime Minister Herzog, Federal Minister of Post and Telegraph Clarkson, and Astor, Chairman of the Imperial Press Conference, who are currently gathering in Cape Town. The views expressed by the speakers in London were greeted with applause by the guests in Cape Town. The speeches of Herzog and others in South Africa could also be heard clearly in the Hyde Park Hotel. Hertzog praised British Prime Minister MacDonald and Lord President Balfour, and said sincerely that in order to seek the recovery of the world economy, trust must replace the existing suspicion and fear. The results of the recent Anglo-French talks, in his view, seem to be a major step towards the desired direction, which is enough to arouse a kind of hope, that is, practical common sense and neighborly friendship have once again become important factors in international relations. Hooton said in his speech that cabinet members responsible for transportation today should keep up with the times, pay attention to the future, and continue to mention the rapid development of wireless telephone and the 100% increase in air mail, saying that all this is a sign of greater success in the future. He then read a letter from the King, which stated that he hoped that the great invention of wireless telephone could further consolidate the friendly cooperation and understanding among the states of the British Empire. Astor made a joke in his speech, saying that the cigar that Cecil smoked in London had an excellent aroma. It is reported that this banquet was arranged by the Overseas Cooperation Association because the representatives participating in the Imperial Press Conference came to South Africa.

<h3 id="e107">The Future of Japanese Finance (Japanese Correspondence) <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Rural Poverty, Increasing National Debt</p>
<p>The crisis in Japan's social economy in the 1934 settlement, such as the frost disaster in the six northeastern prefectures and the drought in Kyushu, has passed. However, the real difficulties will begin in 1935. The problem of not having enough to eat will affect the entire society and will gradually become apparent after the New Year. The military has distributed hundreds of thousands of pieces of clothing and other manufactured goods to local women in the area last winter, employing them in manual labor. The total number is indeed quite large, but it is very limited when divided. The fundamental problem in Japanese rural areas is not temporary but permanent. Therefore, people on both extremes have their own active proposals and express dissatisfaction with the current system.</p>
<p>Politically, at the end of last year, the abolition of the principle of ratio stipulated in the naval treaty was announced. Fortunately, it did not cause any unexpected repercussions internationally. From a certain perspective, it seems to be very beneficial. However, Britain's vigilance in naval bases such as Singapore and Hong Kong is quite obvious. Japan has hinted at concessions to Britain in order to seek future maneuverability, and even hopes for the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. The United States has increased its military budget from US$585 million this year to US$792 million next year, plus US$100 million for reconstruction, bringing the total cost of the army and navy to US$900 million. Compared with Japan's 102.1 million, it is also evenly matched. Although Japan is outwardly very calm about this, it cannot but have some concerns and must quickly plan a response, which is all economically related.</p>
<p>In general economic terms, Japan seemed to have a lot of optimistic material in the past year. Steel production is expected to be around 3.9 million tons, which proves the rapid development of its military industry. In the event of an emergency, it is quite possible to be self-sufficient. In terms of export trade, cotton cloth alone is nearly 240 million square yards, and other artificial silks are all improving, creating a new record for her trade. The first regret is the decline in raw silk exports, which is less than half of the peak period. Oil production only totals 6 million boxes, which is only one-tenth of the total demand. Furthermore, due to the decline in raw silk prices, rural debt cannot be repaid at all, which has a huge impact on cities.</p>
<p>Therefore, although optimistic arguments about government finances are sung to the skies, pessimistic undercurrents are still surging. Although the general accounting revenue for the 1935 fiscal year has increased slightly, deficit bonds still need to be issued for 565 million yen. In addition, there are also special accounting and various business bonds, totaling 750 million yen. If these bonds are calculated at 4% interest, the interest on public debt will increase by at least 30 million yen next year. The various interest payments due before this year have been calculated to reach 37.8 million yen. Adding the aforementioned number, the interest to be paid after next year will be 480 million yen. As for the total amount of various bonds issued in the past, it was 864.1 million yen by the end of last year. Adding the 400 million yen that should have been issued in last year's budget but was not, and the bonds for the 1935 fiscal year, Japan's national debt will reach 987.7 million yen next year. There are also short-term national debts such as rice certificates and treasury securities, totaling more than 300 million yen. In total, it will exceed 1 billion yen. If the interest is calculated at 4%, it will be 400 million yen per year, accounting for one-fifth of Japan's total treasury expenditure, and more than one-half of tax revenue. The total amount accounts for almost one-tenth of Japan's total.</p>
<p>In this situation, who can say that Japan's financial strength is absolutely worry-free and always optimistic? When Takahashi Korekiyo came to power, he thought that there were many optimistic materials for the financial future, and that continuing to issue bonds would not be a problem because there was a market. Capitalists have more surplus power and are not at ease investing their surplus funds overseas. Buying public debt is more convenient. However, the changes in the world situation and the true peace are still unreliable. The expansion of armaments is natural. Japan's expansion of military spending is inevitable. Facing the so-called "international crisis," I am afraid that military spending will increase even more in the recent years, and how much more the number of public bonds will increase is currently difficult to predict.

<h3 id="e108">The Solution of the Chahar Eastern Incident <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Datatan Meeting was Simple in Form</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Withdrew and Firearms were Returned</p>
<p>Order Restored and Local Authorities Prepared Relief Work Beijing Correspondence: The Chahar Eastern issue, which both sides considered a misunderstanding, was resolved through several consultations and negotiations in Beijing. On the 2nd, a simple form was held in Datatan to resolve it on the spot, and it has now been completely concluded. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e109">Meeting Situation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>After both parties decided on the meeting location and date, Zhang Yueting, Chief of Staff of the 37th Division on our side, arrived in Guyuan on the 1st. The Japanese side sent Matsui, a military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, to Guyuan to meet with Zhang. On the morning of the 2nd, Zhang led his entourage, Guo Yukai, Magistrate of Guyuan County, and Zhang Zude, Section Chief of the Chahar Provincial Government, along with Matsui to Datatan. They arrived at 11:00 AM. The Japanese military headquarters sent more than 20 soldiers to welcome them. They went to the Japanese military headquarters to meet with the Japanese representatives, Tanimitsu Isao and Nagami Toshiyoshi, and held a simple ceremony. In addition to expressing regret, they orally agreed on the solution, which was limited to military matters and did not mention politics. The meeting lasted only a few tens of minutes. At 12:00, they had lunch together at the headquarters. After the meal, Zhang and others left Datatan and returned to Zhangjiakou. At 8:15 AM on the morning of the 3rd, Zhang and Zhang Zude went to Beijing to report to He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Solution <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The solution is divided into four items as follows: 1. Express regret. 2. Guarantee that no unfortunate incidents will occur between the two parties in the future. 3. The line of Youtouchengzi, Nan Shizhuzi, and Dongzhaizi will be the boundary, and neither party will encroach on each other. 4. Return the firearms and ammunition seized from the Rehe militia. The military branch announced the solution on the 4th. The original text is recorded below: "According to the report of Song Zheyuan, Commander of the 29th Army and Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, regarding the Chahar Eastern incident, Zhang Yueting, Chief of Staff of the 37th Division of the 29th Army, was sent to Datatan on February 2nd with his entourage Guo Yukai, Magistrate of Guyuan County, and Zhang Zude, Section Chief of the Chahar Provincial Government, to meet with Tanimitsu Isao, Commander of the 13th Brigade of the 7th Division of the Japanese Army, Nagami Toshiyoshi, Commander of the 25th Regiment, and Matsui in Saza. They reached an oral agreement on the solution at 11:00 AM that morning. The Chahar Eastern incident originated from a misunderstanding. Now, in order to peacefully resolve the situation, the Japanese army will immediately return to its original defense, and the 29th Army will not intrude into the line of Shitouchengzi, Nan Shizhuzi, and Dongzhaizi, and the area to its east. All the rifles (37 in total) and 1,500 rounds of ammunition seized by the 29th Army from the Rehe militia will be delivered to Datatan by the Magistrate of Guyuan County on the 7th of this month for return to the Rehe militia."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Japanese Troops Withdraw <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After the agreement was reached by both parties, the Japanese army began to withdraw on the 3rd. The 25th Regiment stationed in Shitouchengzi, Nantan, and other places was withdrawn to its original defense at Gubeikou. The withdrawal has now been completed. The 37 rifles and 1,500 rounds of ammunition seized by our side from the Rehe militia will also be sent to the Japanese military headquarters in Datatan this afternoon (7th).</p>
<h3 id="e112">Order Restored <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese army withdrew, Changliang, Wunihe, Nanbei Shizhuzi, Sidaogou, Mingshatan, and Dongzhaizi were maintained by security police and militia, and order was restored. The Chahar provincial authorities, in view of the fact that the Japanese army invaded eastern Chahar, shelled Dongzhaizi, and sent planes to drop bombs in Dushikou and other places, causing casualties among residents, and destroying houses by bombing, resulting in extremely heavy losses, ordered the provincial government to send personnel to investigate and provide relief to various places, and handle the aftermath.

<h3 id="e113">Inauguration of the Gan Province Pacification Conference <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Discussing Matters Related to Suppression, Post-Disaster Recovery, and Rejuvenation</p>
<p>All Pacification Commanders, Commissioners, and Others Attended</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Gu Zhutong, Director of Jiangxi Pacification, in order to swiftly eliminate remnant bandits, stabilize the region, restore vitality, and plan for rejuvenation, specially convened a provincial pacification conference. It opened on the morning of the sixth at 9:00 AM at the headquarters. Attendees included Pacification Director Gu Zhutong, Chief of Staff Han Deqin, Provincial Chairman Xiong Shihui, various Route Commanders such as Fan Songfu, Pacification Zone Commanders Zhao Guantao, Chen Jicheng, Mao Bingwen, Liu Xing, Zhang Fang, Sun Lianzhong, Tan Daoyuan, Third Route Deputy Commander Luo Zhuoying, Administrative Commissioners and Concurrently Security Commanders Lin Jing, Fan Suzhong, Cao Zubin, Mo Xiong, Hua Xi, Guo Su, Zhou Zuofu, Zhang Dulun, Wang Youlan, Li Zhengyi, Zhang Chi, Shao Hongji, and over sixty senior officials from the Security Office and Pacification Headquarters. Chairman Gu Zhutong presided over the opening ceremony as customary. Gu delivered an opening speech, roughly stating, "This conference aims to establish practical pacification plans, coordinate steps between the Party, government, and military, advance together unanimously, swiftly eliminate remnant bandits, and seek the region's rejuvenation. I hope everyone will strive to fulfill the duties of suppression, post-disaster recovery, stabilization, and rejuvenation." This was followed by a speech from Xiong Shihui, mostly containing words of encouragement. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM and resumed at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. The heads of the military and political groups of the proposal review committee reported on the proposal review opinions and summarized the methods, followed by discussions. Many decisions were made regarding military affairs, transportation, management, health, justice and security, and other matters. On the seventh, discussions continued on political post-disaster recovery cases. The conference is scheduled to last approximately three days.</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, with the commissioners and security commanders of various regions gathered in Nanchang, convened a meeting at the provincial government yesterday. The commissioners reported on the political and suppression situation in their respective jurisdictions, and many instructions were given for improving the difficulties in each region's work. The commissioners also exchanged opinions and corrected each other's mistakes.</p>
<p>The Provincial Anti-Banditry Association is scheduled to host a banquet for Director Gu and all members of the Pacification Conference at the YMCA on the seventh, with all members of the Provincial Party Department and Provincial Government as guests, to offer comfort and appreciation.

<h3 id="e114">Liu Zhenhua Goes to Xunyang <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Reporting on the Suppression of Anhui Bandits</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Chairman Liu Zhenhua, accompanied by Secretary Chen Shikai and guards, departed for Wuhu in seven or eight cars of various sizes at 5:00 PM today from the Shuntunxi Administrative Office. He is temporarily staying at the Dahua Hotel. According to what he said to visitors, his sole purpose in governing during these difficult times for the people is to ensure that they are "poor but at peace." Only when the people can live peacefully can other matters be discussed. Therefore, he will devote all his efforts to suppressing bandits. After the Anhui bandits caused disturbances, he immediately went to Tunxi with key members of the provincial government to supervise the suppression. Now, the bandit leader has been captured and the bandit forces have been completely eliminated. Not counting those who escaped, as many as four thousand bandits were captured, and nearly three thousand guns were seized. The order of Anhui is now completely restored, with dense fortifications and further progress in transportation construction. The Tunxi-Jingdezhen and Xiuning-Qimen sections of the road have been built within a limited time. The road surface project was completed and opened to traffic on the first day of the Lunar New Year. He personally went to inspect the road. Many villagers have returned home to live peacefully. Anhui tea is a specialty of Anhui Province, with an annual sales value of over 20 million yuan. Tea farmers occupy an important position in rural areas. Spring is the season for planting tea. This time, Anhui was severely ravaged by bandits. If the tea farmers are prevented from planting and doing business, the loss will be even greater. Compared to raising funds for temporary disaster relief, the work is immeasurable. Therefore, after the complete restoration of order in Anhui, he deeply hopes that domestic financial and industrial circles and Anhui natives living abroad will invest and lend money, and not miss this greatest source of profit. This is also an essential plan for the revitalization of rural southern Anhui. He plans to rush to Lushan on the eighth, but because the Yangtze River steamer had already departed, he had to stay overnight and take the Yangtze River steamer upstream tomorrow. After finishing matters in Xunyang, he will return to Anqing to handle government affairs, and then go to Tunxi again. In addition to supervising the cleaning of the countryside, he will devote more effort to tea farmers in the spring to seek revitalization. (February 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e115">Surrendered Bandits and Civilians in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Area Urgently Need Relief <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Luotian Dispatch: In recent months, the Red Bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have suffered repeated heavy blows, and their main forces have been routed. The remaining bandits, after being suppressed and pacified by the National Army, have surrendered with their weapons and reformed themselves. However, the internal situation of the bandits has long been dire, and their lives have been entirely dependent on looting. Once they surrender, they lack food and clothing. Moreover, the civilians in the Red areas have repeatedly suffered from banditry and have long been displaced, with most homes empty. In this severe winter, with wind and snow, the surrendered bandits and disaster victims in the Red areas have no clothing or food, and their cries of hunger and cold are particularly distressing. It is reported that Liang Guanying, Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-Fifth Route Army, witnessed the tragic situation and was deeply moved by compassion. He believes that without effective relief, the situation cannot be completely cleared. In addition to drawing over three thousand sets of old cotton military uniforms, which were converted into relief clothing with the words "Relief Clothing" printed to distinguish them from military uniforms, Liang also led the officers and soldiers of the army to make voluntary donations to establish an emergency relief association for assistance. Liang also recently appealed to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, and sent telegrams to the governments of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui to appeal for disaster relief and raise funds for proper relief. It is reported that the Wuhan Three Provinces Anti-Banditry Headquarters plans to allocate several thousand yuan per month, and Anhui Chairman Liu Zhenhua has already allocated three thousand yuan, which will be distributed by Liang. The scope of relief is limited to surrendered refugees and genuinely starving people in the area. Since the implementation, the number of surrendered bandits has been increasing, and the starving people in the disaster area also hope to obtain warmth and food and get through this severe winter. Judging from the current situation, the complete suppression of the Red Bandits in the area is not far away.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Changqiao Elementary School Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Changqiao Town, located in the eastern part of Songjiang County, has always had an elementary school. Its scale is small, and its equipment is simple. It urgently needs to be expanded. A certain gentleman in the town, enthusiastic about education, generously took the responsibility of building a school building. He engaged in fundraising, reaching as far as Beijing and Shanghai, and as far as overseas, raising over five thousand yuan. Construction began and was completed in half a year, and the content began to be gradually improved. Shen Jingquan, the principal of the school, and teachers Gu Mingde, Ji Zongwei, Jiang Fuzhen, and others are all able to patiently guide students. At the beginning of this semester, there were many students, and the classrooms could not accommodate them. The gentleman planned to build more school buildings. He obtained three hundred pieces of calligraphy and painting from contemporary celebrities. From the fourth to the tenth of this month, an exhibition was held at the New Songjiang Society on Songhui Road in Songjiang, and the works were priced for sale, with the proceeds used to expand the school buildings. The reporter happened to visit the society and felt that it was full of dazzling and beautiful works. Among them were Liu San's clerical script, Lu Weizhao's running script, Yang Qianli's cursive script, Wang Zhilin's landscape and running script, Fei Longding's seal script, Zhang Zuocheng's landscape, Yu Jifan's flowers, Lou Yuqing's birds and animals, Yu Xiaolian's animals, Tang Yifang's figures, and Li Zhongjie, Huang Zongxiang, and Zhang Xiaoshi's figure landscapes, all of which are rare artistic masterpieces, and the prices are very low. The reporter spent five yuan to buy a couplet by Liu San, which was very satisfactory. Those who have a fondness for calligraphy and painting should not miss it.</p>
<h3 id="e117">General Situation of Various Industries <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>This county relies mainly on agricultural products, and the prosperity of commerce depends on the abundance of agricultural harvests. Last summer was a severe drought, which greatly affected the rural areas. Fortunately, there was continuous rainfall in the autumn, and the autumn harvest was celebrated. Moreover, the price of rice was high, and the market saw a turnaround. Compared to previous years, it was very different, and the farmers were also very happy. The general business situation of various industries last year is surveyed as follows: Finance Industry, Pawn Industry: Banks and Farmers' Banks have surpluses, and the performance of warehousing is also good. However, the Xingye Branch was affected by the Shanghai branch and has already closed down. It is currently being sued by creditors. After the Money Shop industry has been steadily lending, they all have surpluses. It is reported that Xinyu Ying has a surplus of 10,000 yuan, and Sheng Yuan Cheng Da has a surplus of 8,000 yuan each, and Yu Kang also has a surplus of 5,000 yuan, making it the most promising business in Songshi. The Rice Industry has surpluses due to the continued rise in rice prices. Other industries such as oil, sesame, paint, wheat bran, second-hand clothing, and sundries also have surpluses. The silk and cloth industry has only the Meili Company on Malu Bridge with a surplus, while the rest are average. The industry's thread blankets and cloth factories are all sluggish in sales and have not seen a good situation. Foreign goods and medicinal materials have suffered slight losses, while tea, wine, and local goods are average. The wood industry has a surplus, while the rest are average. However, Shangyi Foreign Goods Store and Qia Daxi Silk and Cloth Store did not welcome the god of wealth last night and seem to be on the verge of closing down.</p>

<p>In the case of the robbery of the Rifeng Jewelry Store in broad daylight and the shooting of Manager Zhao in early December last year, the police team quickly apprehended a young robber named Zhao Zhengyi and seized a pistol. The county government has now transferred the suspect to the court for trial, according to provincial orders.</p>

<p>The local Red Cross branch received a letter from the Shanghai Yizhen Association yesterday, saying, "Respectfully, we have received a letter from Committee Chairman Xu of the Relief Affairs Committee, reporting the establishment of shelters to accommodate refugees from Xiaoshi, Wangdian, Haiyan, Tongxiang, and other places in Zhejiang, and requesting verification. We are specially writing to request your association to send the list of disaster victims to the association for verification. Respectfully, please check and handle accordingly. This is addressed to the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Shanghai Fundraising for Provincial Drought Relief Yizhen Association, President Kong Xiangxi, Vice Presidents Xu Shiying, Wang Zhengting, Wang Zhen, Wu Tiecheng." The branch immediately compiled a list of refugees, totaling one thousand two hundred and twenty-seven men, women, and children from the thirty-first of last month to the fifth of February. Those who are sick are sent to the Ruose Hospital for care, and some are sent to the Rongcheng Hospital, established by Shao Xiu, the former director of the Songjiang Hospital, for free care. However, the Red Cross branch lacks funds and has just been established, which is especially difficult. It has now been decided to convene leaders of local agencies and enthusiastic people at 2:00 PM on Sunday, February 10, to discuss how to proceed and contribute to the good cause.</p>

<p>Village Chief Impersonates Military Officer</p>
<p>Wang Xiren, the village chief of Wangjiabang Village in Xietang Township, Suzhou, impersonated an inspector of the First Replenishment Regiment of the Suzhou Garrison and extorted money from villagers. The matter was discovered by the Garrison, who sent personnel to investigate and found it to be true. They sent a platoon of soldiers and a motorcade from the Public Security Bureau to Xietang Township to arrest him. Wang Xiren was arrested and found to have many cards with the title of Inspector of the First Replenishment Regiment of the Garrison. He was immediately escorted back to the regimental headquarters. After being interrogated by the military judge, he was charged with impersonating a military officer and escorted to the Capital Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>

<p>Due to the sluggish market in Suzhou, the Qian industry has been reduced to thirteen large "Fu" number companies, four "Lu" number companies, and five "Shou" number companies. The final result of this year's settlement is that the silver was tight last year, and business was sparse, so few people made a profit. This year, Fu number companies Fu Yu, Yicheng, and Yu decided to collect debts and stop business. Fu Yu has decided not to continue. The rest of the companies went to the public office to list yesterday (8th) and will send a folding on the 12th to start trading with each other.</p>

<p>Five Counties' Rice Industry Changes to New Measuring Instruments</p>
<p>The peck used by the rice industry in this county was different in size during the Qing Guangxu years. In the first year of Xuantong, the Cao peck was uniformly used and calibrated for use every year. Last year, the rice industry was ordered to change to new measuring instruments, which could not be implemented due to lack of resources. Now, the rice industry in Wuxi, Wujin, Kunshan, Wu County, and Wujiang has changed to new measuring instruments yesterday (8th) to comply with the orders. According to the official peck regulations, the mouth is narrow and the bottom is wide, starting from Jia Sidao of the Song Dynasty. During the Zhiyuan period of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhongcheng Cui or Yan said that the style was narrow at the mouth and wide at the bottom, so the income and expenditure were not very different, and it was implemented in the world. After a long time, the practice was used without modification. The small mouth of the peck means that the peck surface may be shallow or full, and the income and expenditure are limited. Therefore, the method of preventing fraud is very good. Although Jia was a treacherous minister, this regulation of one thing is beneficial to the world.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Changshu <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Road Construction Workers Cause Trouble</p>
<p>Suspension of Sochang Ship</p>
<p>The workers of the Changhua Company, which is building the Suchang Highway, are mostly from other places. Because they have repeatedly obstructed the Suchang ships to and from each other, they have aroused the suspension of the Suchang route by all the ship bureaus, which has lasted for four days and has not been resolved. Transportation has been greatly affected, and mail has also been delayed. According to the occurrence of this incident, the Zhongban ship of the Huitong Company returned to Changzhou from Suzhou on the 3rd. When passing near Wuta Town, dozens of road construction workers forcibly detained the ship and forced it to tow heavy objects. The ship bureau refused to tow because it was afraid of delaying time, which led to a conflict. The workers injured Jin Hongzhi, the cashier of the accounting office. That night, they went to the county government to examine the injury. The next morning, they agreed to recruit merchants, Huimin, Lao Gongmao, and ship bureaus to suspend navigation together. Since then, transportation between Suzhou and Changzhou has been cut off. The county government, fearing the expansion of the situation, sent personnel to mediate. Now the ship bureau has put forward four requirements: 1. Road construction workers can buy half-price tickets to take a boat with a certificate. 2. Refuse to tow heavy materials. If there is an empty boat, it will also be towed at half price. 3. The above two methods shall be handled by the county's letter to the engineering office, and shall be acknowledged in writing by the company. In the future, workers who have the courage to rely on should be investigated according to law. 4. Arrest and investigate the murderers who caused the incident. There are also additional actions, requesting to send more security team members to protect the ship in the most recent ten days. The county government accepted all of them, but the attachment was postponed because the number of team members was insufficient. Now the conditions are roughly appropriate, and there is a saying that the shipping will resume on the ninth.</p>

<p>There was a severe drought in Nantong last year, and the autumn harvest was only 30%. The rural sideline business of earth cloth also failed, and the rural economy is showing signs of total collapse. This year's spring famine is worrying. All sectors have jointly formed a drought relief committee to organize spring relief in the four townships. Li Shenbo, a standing committee member of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, has invited experts to study and improve Tongzhou earth cloth to make up for it.</p>

<p>Respectfully, I read in the local news column of the 8th of your newspaper, "All the telephones in the Songjiang city were damaged." This does not quite match the facts. It was found that on the 6th, Songjiang was hit by wind and snow, and several telephone poles were broken and touched the low-voltage wires of the electric lights. At that time, the telephone company called to notify us, but the meaning was unclear and the call was interrupted. We immediately sent workers to rush to the scene and learned that the company had cut off the main line. At the same time, our company sent the entire team of craftsmen to help investigate. Upon re-examination the next day, it was found that there were as many as nine breaks, which have been reported to the company for repair. This is the process of the situation. I am deeply afraid that the outside world does not know the truth and misunderstandings occur, so I specially write to inform you. I hope you will make corrections. This is addressed to the chief writer of Shen Bao, Songjiang Electric Co., Ltd. (February 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Haili Has Not Been Robbed <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai on the 6th, Now Sailing to Qingdao</p>
<p>Various Rumors Are Groundless</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the Taikoo Steamship Company's Tongzhou ship was robbed by pirates, all sea vessels have stepped up their defenses to prevent accidents. Suddenly, there were rumors that the China Merchants Bureau's Haili ship also encountered pirates. A Central News Agency reporter made a special trip to inquire about everything at the bureau. According to the person in charge of the bureau, since the Puan ship was robbed, the bureau's ships operating along the coast have increased the number of navigation police and added anti-theft equipment to prevent accidents. Therefore, no accidents have occurred since then. After the robbery of the Taikoo Steamship Company's Tongzhou ship, the bureau's sea vessels will be extra vigilant to ensure safe voyages. The reporter then inquired about the rumors of the Haili ship encountering pirates. It was said that when the Haili ship was sailing between Shantou and Hong Kong, it was already night. The patrolling navigation police suddenly faintly saw someone climbing up the "Wind Turbine." They immediately rushed to investigate, but the person was gone. The entire navigation police were notified to be on alert and searched the cabins, but no suspicious person or robbery was found. The order was good, and no incident occurred at all. The ship returned to Shanghai on the 6th and will sail north to Qingdao on the 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e132">British Parliament Continues to Discuss the Tongzhou Ship Robbery Case <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Masden's Question</p>
<p>Caused Laughter</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: At today's meeting of the House of Commons, the Tongzhou ship robbery was mentioned again. Conservative MP Agnew proposed that the British Ambassador to China, Kadgan, be instructed to negotiate with the Chinese government to clear the pirate dens in Dapeng Bay and other places with the assistance of the British Navy. Secretary of State Eden replied that the problem of pirates in Chinese waters is currently being carefully considered. All plans that can help this matter will not be ignored. The Chinese and British navies are currently cooperating closely. It is not beneficial to continue other actions at this time. The MP also said that he heard that this kind of pirate cannot be eradicated by the navy alone. Eden replied that he thought that the actions taken at sea had achieved particularly good results. Eden continued that the British Consul General in Shanghai, Bilinan, will, together with the naval authorities and the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, thoroughly investigate the robbery of the Tongzhou ship. Agnew then asked the government whether it intended to ask the Chinese government to send troops to besiege the pirates' dens on the shore. Eden replied that the close cooperation between the Chinese and British authorities was very effective. Then Conservative MP Masden asked Eden whether he would ask the League of Nations to convey the pirates to show goodwill, which caused laughter. Eden did not answer.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 8th: Naval authorities claimed today that Chinese troops had captured one of the pirates who robbed the Tongzhou ship on January 29 on the west side of Dapeng Bay. The remaining bandits are also being pursued.</p>
<p>Demei Evening News reports: This morning (8th) at 9:00, the British authorities reopened the court in the Taikoo Steamship Company to investigate the Tongzhou ship robbery. The British Consul General in Shanghai, Sir Bilinan, presided over the meeting. Representatives from the French Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, the British Navy in China, and the Taikoo Company attended the meeting. After the investigation is completed, the report will be submitted to the British Minister to China (for transmission to London) and the Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China. It is said that it does not contain any suggestions. Judging from the situation of the two-day investigation, the report will detail the situation of the robbery as described by the witnesses. It is heard that the staff of the Chinese mainland churches in Shanghai were also summoned to testify. The witnesses included Chinese and Russians. Everything said must be translated into English, so it will take some time. It is said that experts will be consulted to revise the anti-theft measures, with particular emphasis on the ship passenger regulations, iron fences, and radio.</p>
<p>The passengers on the Tongzhou ship who transferred to the Shandong ship to Shanghai were taken to the Customs Water Police Station when they arrived at the Wusongkou. Forty-five passengers and a Westerner from the Taikoo Company, Liang Jintang, went to the Water Police Station for investigation. As a result, the forty-five passengers were not suspicious. They were released by the Water Police Station that night and taken back to the ship by the Taikoo Company's staff, preparing to take the original ship to Yantai today.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Yangtze River Water Level Suddenly Drops, "Jiang Hua" Ship Aground at Huangzhou <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Freed After a Day and Night of Unloading Cargo</p>
<p>Large Yangtze River Vessels Suspended</p>
<p>Since November 15th of last year, the water volume of the upper Yangtze River has been steadily increasing, with the gauge between Hankou and Jiujiang consistently at 16 feet 5 inches, and between Jiujiang and Wuhu consistently at 18 feet 6 inches. These levels are rarely seen in historical water gauge records. Therefore, even during the dry winter season, large, shallow-draft ships could navigate. Companies did not increase their shallow-draft fees, assuming there would be no receding of the Yangtze River. However, after the beginning of spring, the upper river water level dropped dramatically, with decreases of over four feet in a single day. Yesterday, various shipping companies received reports from Hankou stating that the water level had dropped sharply since the afternoon of the 6th. The level between Hankou and Xunyang had fallen to 11 feet 2 inches, and between Xunyang and Wuhu to only 12 feet 3 inches. The water is expected to continue receding on the 7th and 8th. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River vessel "Jiang Hua" left Shanghai for Hankou on the 5th of this month. When it sailed upriver from Shanghai, the upper river water level had not yet dropped significantly, only gradually decreasing. On the morning of the 7th, when the ship reached the Huangzhou section of the river above Jiujiang, the water gauge suddenly decreased. The "Jiang Hua" ship, with its deeper draft, ran aground. Ship numbers 24214, 2 award 41214, 3 award 10218, awarded scholarships to 35 students by Yu Guang School in Shude Lane, Xinzha Road. The following awards will be presented by participating manufacturers, and the last four characters will receive a copy of the Yu Guang weekly calendar.</p>
<h3 id="e135">All Businesses Reopened Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>However, Vacant Properties for Rent Are Conspicuous</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks, money shops, exchanges, and stores of all sizes resumed business yesterday after a four-day spring festival holiday that began on the 4th. However, the market economy remains as depressed as before, and the number of "For Rent" signs on buildings along the streets is strikingly high, almost unprecedented for such a dismal economic situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Owner Chen Jin Yu, assumed it could free itself, so he immediately reversed the engine, planning to leave the shallows. Unexpectedly, the bottom of the ship sank deeply into the shallow sand, and could not move. Owner Chen had no choice but to telegraph a report to the Shanghai General Bureau and ask for a ship to be sent for rescue. The General Bureau immediately telegraphed the Hankou Branch, ordering Branch Manager Cai Lisheng to quickly order the Jiang Jing vessel on its way to the Huangzhou river surface, to drag the Jiang Hua out. Later, according to a follow-up telegram, the Jiang Jing's efforts to tow the ship failed due to shallow waters. Furthermore, since the Jiang Hua could not be dragged out of the shallows due to the continuous decrease of water in the Hanxun section of the river, the Shanghai Bureau telegraphed Hankou again, ordering the dispatch of the Li Ji and Mei Li vessels, and to send workers from Hankou to unload the cargo and passengers from the Jiang Hua, in order to reduce the load and attempt to rescue it. On the 7th, throughout the day and night, part of the ship's cargo was unloaded in succession, carried back to Hankou by the Mei Li and other vessels. The Jiang Shun vessel was also ordered to Huangzhou to tow the ship. By 8:30 AM yesterday morning, the Jiang Hua vessel had been dragged out of the shallows. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Bureau received a telegram stating that the Jiang Hua had been rescued and was now sailing to Hankou. The passengers on board had also safely arrived in Hankou, and the cargo was undamaged. Whether the bottom of the ship was damaged during the grounding will be inspected after its arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A telegram from the Jianghan Customs notified Shanghai shipping companies that all vessels going up and down the river, starting yesterday, are restricted in their cargo loading draft, not to exceed 11 feet 2 inches. If this limit is exceeded, it will be difficult to reach Hankou. As a result, large vessels with a draft exceeding 12 feet in the Yangtze River have suspended operations. The Sanbei Changxing vessel, due to its large hull and draft of around 13 feet, was decided to be suspended and sent to the factory for repairs today. Other larger vessels from various companies have also reduced their cargo tonnage starting yesterday.</p>

<p>The closing ceremony of the Western Shanghai National Products Joint Movement Conference, organized by the Western Shanghai Tenant Associations Alliance, was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. Approximately 300 people attended, including Lin Kanghou, Yao Shaofu, and Zhu Wenyao, a representative from the participating manufacturers. After the ceremonies, Chairman Zhuang Ping delivered a speech and invited Mr. Lin Kanghou to lower the flag, followed by the announcement of the closing. The Student National Products Year Student Lottery tickets that were previously given away were also drawn publicly at the venue yesterday. Regarding the benefits, nothing is better than holding a National Products Exhibition. Therefore, this association has paid special attention to National Products Exhibitions in recent years, having held them in various locations both locally and abroad, achieving remarkable results that are truly gratifying. This association previously received a letter from the Shaoxing County Party and Government organs, requesting that we lead national product factories to participate in the (Second Shaoxing County) National Products Exhibition Conference. After consideration, this association believes that Shaoxing is an important county town in eastern Zhejiang, with a dense population and thriving commerce, historically known for its affluence. The dumping of foreign goods there each year is quite substantial. To reclaim our interests and prevent the leakage of wealth, we should support this initiative. After both parties reached an agreement, preparations began immediately, and are now in full swing. The opening is scheduled for March 1st, lasting three weeks, at the most commercially vibrant area in Shaoxing City. Registration begins today (registration at No. 4, Yongji Lane, intersection of Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, telephone 94185). We have long admired your factory's excellent products, which are better than imported goods, and we are sending this notice specifically to encourage you to participate enthusiastically, jointly devise plans for the future of national products, and deeply rely on you. Please find enclosed a copy of the regulations for your review.</p>

The association deeply agreed with this matter regarding the promotion of national products. After several contacts between the two parties, they began preparations and planned to open on March 1st. The notice to manufacturers stated, "Regarding the notice, promoting national products is the only effective tool to resist the economic invasion of the great powers. All Chinese people should practice it diligently to reverse this national economic disaster. The most important thing in promoting national products is publicity, and the most obvious of publicity's effects," Chairman Chu Huiseng and others resolved to request four points, which were submitted to the Zhejiang Construction Department for adoption. The original text is excerpted below. Regarding the request for four points to be adopted for this year's spring cocoon season. We respectfully submit that the cocoon industry is declining and nearing extinction. If it is not maintained, it will disappear. We have heard that the Department plans to implement control measures for this year's spring cocoon. The cocoon merchants are all in a state of anxiety due to their personal interests. In order to protect the interests of all Zhejiang cocoon merchants, the association convened a temporary meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members and representatives from the cocoon industry trade unions of various counties on January 29th. A unanimous resolution was passed to request four points, which are listed below. (1) Please exempt the cocoon improvement fee for this year's spring cocoon. (2) Regarding the purchase of native silkworm fresh cocoons, in addition to complying with the prices set by the official authorities, the rest should be free to operate. (3) In addition to the areas designated by the official authorities, the cocoon shops should be freely negotiated and leased by the cocoon merchants and shop owners. (4) Before the promulgation of the management methods for cocoon collection and control methods, the Department or the Silkworm Silk Control Committee should first submit a draft to the association for discussion, so that they can contribute their opinions. It is respectfully submitted that the above four points have been discussed repeatedly, so as to ensure that the government's great plan to improve silk cocoons does not disregard the cocoon merchants' last resort for survival. The cocoon merchants' last chance for survival is just a thread. We respectfully request that the Department grant full adoption, so that in the midst of renewed governance, there is both compassion for merchants and convenience for the people. All Zhejiang cocoon merchants await respite. Respectfully submitted by Zeng, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department.</p>

<p>Company Agrees in Principle</p>
<p>Li Jingcong Will Fly to Xinjiang</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, the Eurasia Aviation Company's planned Eurasia route has been delayed for more than a year due to issues with passing through Xinjiang Province and the lack of agreement from the provincial authorities. A China News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Zhu Qin'ao, the company's secretary, yesterday. According to him, the long-delayed Eurasia air route has been resolved. Mr. Zhu was originally sent by the company to Xinjiang Province to handle matters related to the Eurasia air route. He stayed in Xinjiang for more than a year without results. Mr. Zhu returned to Shanghai from Xinjiang last month. Sheng Shicai, the Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang Province, drafted a plan and entrusted him to convey it to the company's authorities, first realizing the Shanghai-Xinjiang air route. He stipulated that the Shanghai-Hami section would be managed by the Eurasia Company, while the Hami-Tacheng section would be managed by Xinjiang Province itself. After returning to Shanghai, Mr. Zhu reported to the company's authorities. The company has expressed its agreement in principle with Mr. Sheng's plan. Detailed measures have been drafted and telegraphed to Mr. Sheng. Currently, Mr. Li Jingcong, the company's general manager, went to Jiangxi the day before yesterday. As soon as Mr. Sheng's reply telegram arrives in Shanghai, he will fly to Xinjiang to meet with Mr. Sheng and sign a contract.</p>

<h3 id="e144">All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Conference Decides to Continue Spring Relief Efforts <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Continue Donating 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Publish Donation Appeal</p>
<p>According to the Public News Agency, the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association decided to continue with spring relief efforts, as the winter relief efforts had concluded, but the relief grain distributed was very small and the disaster victims could not maintain their livelihoods. A joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was held at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss solutions. More than 20 people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Chu Huiseng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Shen Junru, Zhang Shenzhi, Wu Zhihao, Mao Heyuan, and Cha Zhongjian. It was decided to continue spring relief efforts to help the disaster victims. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Continue Spring Relief: Chairman Chu Huiseng first reported on the income and expenditure figures, the situation of the winter relief efforts, and the letters and telegrams requesting relief from various parties. The following proposals were then decided: (1) Although the winter relief efforts have ended, the amount of relief grain distributed was very small. With the harvest still far off, the disaster victims cannot maintain their lives. Should we continue with spring relief efforts in order to thoroughly provide relief? It was decided to continue with spring relief efforts. In addition to requesting funds from the province, there is still a shortage of approximately 200,000 yuan. We should do our best to raise funds from all sectors of society, publish a thank-you note in the newspaper for the donors who donated before January 3rd, and publish a report on the association's winter relief efforts, as well as income, expenditure, and relief summaries. (2) To send Chu Huiseng, Wang Xiaolai, and Zhang Xiaolin to Hangzhou on behalf of the association to request funds from the province in order to facilitate the continuation of spring relief efforts. It was decided to approve this proposal. (3) The deadline for spring relief is approaching, and the association should intensify its work and set 5:00 PM every day as the time for all committee members to attend meetings and discuss matters in order to facilitate progress. It was decided to approve this proposal. Rest omitted.</p>
<p>Donation Appeal: The Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association issued a donation appeal to report on the progress of the winter relief efforts and to continue with the spring relief efforts. We respectfully inform you that last year's drought in Zhejiang Province affected almost the entire province. More than 50 counties experienced harvests of 20% or less, and millions of disaster victims were without clothes or food, and died daily. This association witnessed this heartbreaking situation and solicited donations to provide relief. Since the start of the efforts, we have raised more than 148,000 yuan. At this time of social and economic hardship, we deeply rely on the enthusiastic contributions of all great philanthropists to achieve such results and to revive those on the brink of death. On behalf of the disaster victims, we express our deepest gratitude. However, there are too many disaster victims, and our efforts to provide widespread relief are hampered by limited resources. After consulting with the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association and the Shanghai Fundraising for Provincial Drought Relief Association, we agreed to divide the responsibilities. The Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association is responsible for 22 counties, and the Drought Relief Association is responsible for 12 counties. This association is responsible for 13 counties, and we have followed the principle of providing relief grain to those who cannot survive without it, focusing on the elderly, weak, women, and children. We have distributed winter relief, allocating all the donated funds and the 50,000 yuan allocated by the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association. We distributed 8,000 bags of relief powder in Jiaxing, 8,000 bags of relief powder in Chongde, 6,000 bags of relief powder in Tongxiang, 1,000 shi of relief rice in each of the three counties of Wukang, Yuhang, and Deqing, 5,000 dan of corn and 1,700 shi of relief rice in the three counties of Shangyu, Xinchang, and Shengxian, 2,000 shi of relief rice in Haiyan, and more than 2,000 yuan each for relief rice in parts of Shaoxing and Yuyao. Each county has been carefully assigned a relief director, who strictly investigates without omission or abuse, and the county governments have received the relief grain and distributed it to the disaster victims in person. In Haining County, the relief efforts were carried out by the Chinese Health Association, the Red Cross Society, and the Bodhi Dharma Association, with 5,000 yuan allocated by this association. This association also subsidized 4,000 yuan each to the two counties of Wuxing and Shouchang. This is a general overview of the winter relief efforts. Detailed accounts will be published after completion to ensure transparency. The winter relief grain distributed only provided enough porridge for an average of one month per person due to limited funds and widespread disaster. From the time of distribution until the beginning of spring, the small amount of relief grain received has been exhausted. With the harvest still far off and spring planting remote, the future is dire, and lives are at risk. If spring relief efforts are not continued, these tens of thousands of elderly, weak, women, and children will inevitably end up in ditches. This association fears that the relief efforts will not be thorough and will abandon previous efforts, burdening the great philanthropists' merits. We have no choice but to continue with spring relief efforts to fulfill our responsibility. We estimate that we need to raise approximately 200,000 yuan. We respectfully request that all domestic dignitaries and ladies of the boudoir generously open their purses and contribute generously. Those who have already donated are requested to donate more to complete the effort, and those who have not yet donated are requested to donate quickly to sow the seeds of virtue. We await your contributions with utmost anticipation. Respectfully yours.</p>

After the French Concession repeatedly interfered with the factories, the factory authorities, unable to bear the harassment, have decided that the Mei Ya Jingwei Factory on Avenue Petain will move out of the concession and into the South City to avoid the unreasonable interference of the French Concession authorities.</p>

If the rainfall is even this year, it is expected that prices will gradually decline.</p>

<p>Holding Hands Together on the Huangpu River, Seeking a Phoenix, New Music is Played</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling and Mao Yanwen will hold their wedding ceremony at Moore Memorial Church at 4:00 PM today. The reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency has specially learned the following details of their love affair from various sources:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Love Affair <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Since the death of Xiong's wife, Madame Zhu Qihui, four years ago, Xiong has deeply felt the lack of a capable assistant. In the past year, he has been recuperating in Qingdao and Shanghai, and his affairs have been difficult to manage. He then had the intention of remarrying. Through the introduction of his niece, he made an alliance with Ms. Mao Yanwen. Ms. Mao graduated from the School of Education at the University of Michigan in the United States and has served as a professor at Fudan, Daxia, and Jinan Universities. She is currently also the Director of Student Affairs at Fudan University. She is rich in knowledge and experience, and especially loves children. She was a classmate of Xiong's niece and other students, and Madame Xiong Zhu Qihui loved her very much. They treated each other like family. This time, after Xiong's repeated requests, Ms. Mao agreed because their personalities and careers matched. According to the reporter, the father of the Song Dynasty celebrity Ouyang Xiu was twenty-nine years older than his mother. Now Xiong is still two years younger than Ouyang. The marriage of the two has been brewing for a long time, and there is an interesting story. Xiong is old and his beard is quite long, almost a foot long. Mao politely did not want this thing that he was always thinking about, so Xiong immediately shaved it off as instructed, which is also a good story.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 2:30 PM, Xiong and Ms. Mao went to Moore Memorial Church together to rehearse the wedding. Because they were not very familiar with the wedding ceremony in the church, they went to Moore Memorial Church in advance to practice in preparation for today's wedding. Those who went with him yesterday included Zhu Tingqi, Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and fifteen or sixteen people including the secretary of the office. Three female guests accompanied Mao. Pastor Zhu Baoyuan, the officiant, also went to provide training, which lasted about an hour before they left. On that day, Xiong wore a blue robe and a black waistcoat, with a coat on the outside. He looked more handsome than before, like someone in his fifties. Mao wore a coat and floral velvet shoes, looking quite simple.</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony will be held at Moore Memorial Church today at 3:00 PM. After the ceremony, there will be a short rest, and then they will go to the New Asia Hotel to host a banquet. The wedding invitations were sent out several days ago, and the wording was very simple. The original text said, "We respectfully invite you to attend our wedding ceremony at 3:00 PM on February 9th (Saturday) of the Gregorian calendar. Sincerely, Xiong Xiling and Mao Yanwen." It also stated, "The ceremony will be held at Moore Memorial Church, Xizang Road, and the wedding banquet will be held at New Asia Restaurant, North Sichuan Road (seated at 6:00 PM)." In addition, Mao has applied for leave from the two universities she serves, Jinan and Fudan, so that she can spend her honeymoon after the wedding.</p>

<p>Alas, when I look back at the affairs of the world, I feel that I have been suffering year after year, and my sick appearance is thin. I want to seek a new life, only through spiritual struggle, gradually turning the spring back to the withered willow. The landscape outside the building is so beautiful, with skilled needles, I carefully embroider mandarin ducks. On the Huangpu River, we hold hands together, playing new music to seek the phoenix. I dare to boast that, like the old man Lai and Beiguo, we will cultivate and sweep together in seclusion, teaching children to care for children, going beyond the close-knit family. Five hundred babies are diligently cared for, and cradles everywhere need loving mothers. Heaven has made a perfect match, and we have found a good partner.</p>

<p>Just Considering the Dongjiadu Police Station Alone</p>
<p>A Total of 141 People Arrested in Four Days</p>
<p>During the abolished Lunar New Year, some ignorant citizens still indulged in old bad habits and gathered to gamble. The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Chaoji, in view of this, specially instructed all subordinate branch bureaus and police stations on New Year's Eve to strictly prohibit gambling. As a result, many gambling cases have been uncovered in various places in recent days. Just considering the Dongjiadu Police Station in Nanshi alone, from the 4th to the 7th of this month, sixteen gambling cases have been uncovered in four days, and as many as 141 gamblers have been arrested. A special report is recorded as follows: On the 4th, Gu A'si and four others were arrested for gambling with Pai Gow at the Zhenxing Teahouse on Nanmatou Street.

<p>Once Kidnapped, His Nerves Were Stimulated</p>
<p>It Was a Misunderstanding, and He Was Given a Light Punishment to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>Wang Ruibao, a 19-year-old boy from Ningbo, lived at No. 1451, Zhonghua Road and studied at Derun English College. During the Dragon Boat Festival earlier this year, he was kidnapped in the Xinjiao Street area and trapped in a bandit den for two weeks, suffering greatly. As a result, he was extremely stimulated in his mind. His father, Wang Renfu, was the manager of Fenghua Paint Store on Jiaotong Road. Recently, at 5:00 PM, he went to the Town God Temple with his sisters to eat snacks at Suxiangzhai. On the way home, his sisters went to a relative's house, while he went north alone to Xinbeimen, where he encountered plainclothes police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau checking pedestrians. Ruibao mistakenly identified them as kidnappers and ran away. The police immediately suspected him and chased him, knocking Ruibao down. Ruibao was extremely frightened and fiercely bit the pursuing policeman's finger, causing blood to flow. The patrol police helped check Ruibao's person and found 55 yuan in cash, a gold watch, and a pen, but no prohibited items. Because he injured a public official, he was immediately taken to the police station for investigation. After Director Liu interrogated him, he learned that Wang Ruibao had mistakenly identified the police as kidnappers and his nerves were stimulated, so he bit a public official. Considering that the incident was a misunderstanding, he was ordered to pay for medical expenses and given a light punishment to settle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Police Chief Who Conspired to Murder Has Been Sentenced <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Ten Months</p>
<p>Gong Jinlin, the owner of Dalongyang Grocery Store in Yangjiadu Town, Pudong, recently filed a lawsuit in the local court against Wu Tianzhi, the police chief of Yangjiadu Police Station, for shooting at night. The cause of this case was that Wu Tianzhi had previously bought goods on credit from the store, but Gong refused to give him credit. Wu harbored resentment. Also, on the 19th day of the tenth month of the abolished lunar calendar last year, when Gong Jinlin's daughter got married, Wu Tianzhi dared to lift the curtain of the sedan chair and openly insult her when the sedan chair arrived at the Yangjiadu Wharf. Gong Jinlin negotiated with him, but Wu was at a loss for words and became angry. On the 28th day of the same month, at about 2:00 AM, he placed a ladder against the wall of the store. Gong Jinlin woke up in his sleep and shouted to ask who it was. Wu immediately fired two shots, which were heard by the neighbors. The nearby patrol policeman Zhou came to investigate and saw him leaving with the ladder. Gong Jinlin did not want to cause trouble and did not report it at the time. Unexpectedly, after several days, Wu bragged outside that he would definitely put Gong Jinlin to death. Gong thought that Wu Tianzhi was a police chief, and his pistol was always with him. Since he intended to kill him, it could happen at any time. Gong was anxious and reported the facts. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin summoned Wu Tianzhi for interrogation and detained him, and also ordered inspectors Sun Yulin, policeman Zhou Guobao, etc., to be brought to court for questioning. The various shops in the town, such as Tongsheng South Goods Store, Huang Hengji Rice Store, Xiangtai Brick and Ash Store, Dingxing Meat Store, Cunxintang Pharmacy, Chen Shuxing Funeral Goods Store, and Shengchang Grocery Store, jointly stamped and submitted a public petition to the court, stating that Wu Tianzhi fired a gun at night and requesting a severe punishment. They stated that citizens pay taxes, and the country establishes the police, originally to protect the local area. However, the defendant, as a police officer, actually used his position to harm other people's lives, which shocked the city. At that time, he missed the shot, but he is still unwilling to give up. If this kind of harmful police officer is not punished by law, then the local citizens will be in danger. For this reason, they respectfully request that he be severely punished according to the law to ensure the safety of the citizens, etc. Prosecutor Kong did not tire of seeking details and repeatedly investigated the facts. The criminal court was prosecuted and a verdict was announced. In the case of Wu Tianzhi obstructing freedom (main text): Wu Tianzhi threatened others with the intention to harm their lives, causing danger to their safety, and was sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment. It is said that Wu did not accept the verdict and applied for an appeal according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Yi Fangshuo's Appeal Case <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Debate Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Bail Granted Pending Ruling</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a comedian from Hangzhou who performed in the rooftop garden of the New-New Company, was arrested by the French Concession police after being accused of raping his cousin Yi Baozhu. It was also found that Yi bought women Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu at a price, made them learn drama, and monitored their actions. He was transferred to the Second Special Court and prosecuted on three charges: obscenity, harming the family, and restricting freedom. During the trial, the plaintiff withdrew the charge of obscenity. As a result of the trial, he was sentenced to three years in prison only for the charge of restricting freedom. He was found not guilty of harming the family, and the charge of obscenity was not accepted. Yi refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court, based on the complaint, scheduled a hearing yesterday afternoon to summon witnesses. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Yi's guarantor, surnamed Weng, was summoned to court for questioning. At 1:00 PM, the witnesses in the case, Yi Baozhu, Li Xiaozhen, Ye Jinzhu, and Yang Lingzhu, and Yang Yi (Yang Lingzhu's mother-in-law, Yi Fangshuo's sister) and Ye Li (Ye Jinzhu's mother) arrived at the court to await questioning. At 3:00 PM, Judge Guo Dezhang, together with Judges Sun Honglin and Jia Gen, and Clerk Huang Lixiang, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, opened the third criminal court for trial. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang represented the Public Security Office in court. The appellant was defended by lawyers Sha Xunyi and Lou Yunmei. This case caused a sensation in society and attracted a large crowd of onlookers to the court yesterday. After the court opened, the officials ordered the bailiffs to bring the appellant Yi Fangshuo from the detention center. They first asked his age, origin, address, and occupation, and then asked Yi about the case of restricting freedom. The First Instance Court of the Second Special District sentenced you to three years in prison. Are you appealing because you disagree? Yi replied yes. The officials ordered him to state the reasons for his disagreement. Yi replied that this was completely unjust. They were very free and easy to learn drama in my place. Their actions were not monitored. Moreover, they were all relatives and children who voluntarily learned drama. Those who wanted to learn for three to five years, and those who didn't want to would go back. There were no contracts or fixed terms. He was asked if they (referring to Yi Baozhu, Li Xiaozhen, Yang Lingzhu, and Ye Jinzhu) testified very clearly in the original trial that their actions were monitored by his wives and concubines. He replied no, it was really unjust. When they went to perform, they went with the performers. Their performances were in front, and my wife was behind. My wives and concubines all performed with me, so how could they monitor them? However, after they gave a good performance, they were still accompanied home by the performers. He was asked if Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen testified very clearly in the original trial that they were not allowed to go out alone and had to be accompanied by someone. Ye Jinzhu testified most clearly. He replied that it was unjust. He was asked if the two girls, Yang Lingzhu and Ye Jinzhu, were bought by him. He replied no. Yang Lingzhu was his nephew's wife, and Ye Jinzhu was the daughter of Section Chief Ye, who was introduced by a man named Zhou. Now Zhou has drowned. They verbally agreed to a three- to five-year term for learning drama. During the learning period, he was responsible for the teachers' salaries, food, and clothing. The income from the performances was also his. After they successfully learned, they would be given an uncertain amount of one to twenty yuan per period, and one yuan per hall for each performance. At this point, the officials summoned Yi Baozhu, Li Xiaozhen, Yang Lingzhu, and Ye Jinzhu to court and questioned them about monitoring and restricting freedom. The testimony of the four women completely overturned their testimony to the original trial and the police. They denied that anyone was monitoring them. They had never testified in the original trial or to the police that their actions were being monitored. Yang Yi testified that he brought Jian Chen to be his daughter-in-law. His son is twelve years old this year. Her original surname was Wang, and she entered the family at the age of six. Her father had died, and her mother's name was Wang Caiying, who had remarried and was now unknown. When she was brought into the family, he gave her a bellyache money of four yuan. Ye Li testified that Jinzhu was his daughter. She was born to his sister, who gave her to him as his daughter three months after his child died. On the 26th day of the tenth month of her tenth year, she was brought to Yi Fangshuo to learn drama through the introduction of a man named Zhou. At this point, the officials ordered the debate to begin. First, the prosecutor stated his opinion, and then the lawyer from the Public Security Office and the appellant's defense lawyer debated each other. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 15th. The appellant was still remanded to custody. Yi's defense lawyer requested that he be granted bail. The officials ordered that the decision be made after deliberation.</p>
<h3 id="e160">More Than Eighty Handcarts Confiscated <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Increasing Numbers Without License Plates</p>
<p>Obstructing Traffic, All Confiscated</p>
<p>There is a type of handcart in Shanghai that is purely made of iron, with a rectangular body and four wheels on the bottom. One end of the cart is equipped with an iron rod, allowing it to be pushed by hand. This type of iron cart is almost a necessity for tobacco and paper shops and tofu shops, used to transport copper coins and tofu. It is common to see them on the streets. The Public Works Department Traffic Office has always considered them small in size and not affecting traffic on the roads. Therefore, any vehicle is required to have a license plate donated by the owner before it is allowed to be driven, but this type of cart is given preferential treatment, exempted from donating a license plate, and allowed to pass at will, without any restrictions or interference. Recently, they have been seen in increasing numbers. Those responsible for traffic management believe that since the creation of the license plate donation system has failed to cover them, and allowing them to continue to be let go will be even more detrimental to traffic, a notice has been issued to all police stations that if any such vehicles are found to be obstructing traffic, they should be taken to the police station for disposal in accordance with the law. In recent days, the number of carts detained by the Xinzha Police Station has reached as many as eighty. Yesterday, a large car was used to transport all the confiscated iron carts to the First Special District Local Court for disposal. After being questioned by the judge of the vehicle affairs court, it was ruled that all the vehicles should be confiscated. This is the first time that this type of cart has been confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Female Worker's Beauty Leads to Failed Seduction and Assault <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Tan Dajinlong is Extremely Unscrupulous</p>
<p>Resulting in an Eight-Month Sentence for the Assault</p>
<p>Zhang Peizhen, a female worker from Anhui at the Nanyang Tobacco Company, has an attractive appearance and fashionable attire, which aroused the envy of Tan Dajinlong, a Yancheng native living nearby. In February of last year, Tan would wait for Ms. Zhang to leave work every day in the afternoon and follow her home, harassing and teasing her. Ms. Zhang could not bear the harassment and was very angry, slapping him twice to end his desires. Tan harbored resentment and escaped, intending to retaliate with vicious means. Recently, he saw that Ms. Zhang was even more beautiful than before, but he could not touch her and was slapped instead, which made him angrier. He picked up a sharp little file at a certain wharf, and on the morning of the 31st of last month, at 6:45 AM, he secretly waited at the intersection of East Broadway Road and Huaji Road. When Ms. Zhang and her companion Ms. Cui Lanying passed by, he suddenly rushed out and stabbed Ms. Zhang's back and arms with the file three times, causing her to fall to the ground and cry for help. Ms. Cui grabbed his arm and shouted for the police, but she was also stabbed in the left arm. Police Officer No. 37 from Sandao Tou West Station arrived after hearing the alarm and chased after Tan, capturing him along with the murder weapon and taking him to the Huishan Police Station. He was sent to the First Special District Court for instructions pending the recovery of the victims. The two women were sent to the Tongren Hospital. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and they were discharged from the hospital and returned home the next day. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over a retrial at the Third Criminal Court. Public Works Department lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case. The two women then testified about the circumstances of the stabbing at the time. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. Judge Wu sentenced Tan Dajinlong to eight months imprisonment and confiscated the file.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The Estranged Couple Cannot Reach an Agreement <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Divorce Negotiations Fail</p>
<p>Disputes Over Living Expenses Arise Again</p>
<p>Lin Huantang, a Cantonese man, had a love affair with a Japanese woman after studying in the United States. They lived together for several years before bringing her to Shanghai, acting as husband and wife. However, he treated his original wife, Li Fenglin, as a stranger and did not provide for her. Ms. Li filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. The initial trial ruled that the two parties should live separately and that Lin should pay Ms. Li 60 yuan per month for living expenses. However, Lin claimed that he could not afford to pay and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting a reduction to 30 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Li, together with Judges Ye and Wu, held a hearing. After Lin's lawyer stated the intention of the appeal, Ms. Li's lawyer rebutted that Lin had married a Japanese woman and was living with her, so his monthly living expenses must be considerable. However, he claimed that he could not afford to pay his original wife 60 yuan per month for living expenses, which was clearly untrue. Lin's sole purpose was to get a divorce, but Ms. Li would accept it if there were appropriate terms. Therefore, they had negotiated outside once. Ms. Li initially wanted more than 5,000 yuan, but later reduced it to 5,000. Lin had gradually increased his offer to 4,400 yuan, which was not far off, and it was easy to reach an agreement. However, Lin broke his promise and reduced his offer to more than 3,000 yuan, which led to the breakdown of the negotiations. It was found that Lin's father owned a large amount of assets. Now that his father is dead, Lin has received more than 10,000 yuan of the inheritance. In addition, Lin brought 40,000 to 50,000 US dollars from the United States and had 5,000 in public bonds. He also had a house worth 30,000 yuan in his hometown, and also owned a house in the United States, which currently generates more than 20 US dollars in monthly rent. His claim that he only had several thousand in assets was purely a lie. Ms. Li also filed a counter-appeal, requesting that the living expenses be changed to 85 yuan per month and that Lin be ordered to provide a cash guarantee, etc. After the two parties concluded their arguments in court, the ruling was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month.</p>

<p>Yesterday's High Price Was 3,300 Wen</p>
<p>The local money industry opened yesterday, and the exchange rate of silver dollars rose sharply. Yesterday's high price was 330,000 wen for every 100 yuan in silver dollars, which is equivalent to 3,300 wen per silver dollar. The price of silver coins also rose, with one silver dollar exchanging for 12 silver coins and 369 wen. However, the exchange shops in the British and French Concessions and the Chinese areas of the North and South cities hung signs that they would only exchange 3,000 wen or 3,040-50 wen for each silver dollar, up to about 3,100 wen. The reason for this was that the exchange shops had lost too much on the copper coins and silver coins they had taken in last year.</p>

<p>The House Collapsed First, Then Caught Fire, No One Escaped</p>
<p>Six People Severely Injured, Two Died From Their Injuries</p>
<p>丨Hidden Alcohol Found to be Used for Manufacturing Drugs丨</p>
<p>At No. 50 to 52 Xinglong, Lane 136 (Zunde Lane) south of the old Garbage Bridge at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road, the business has been open for many years. The house has six upper and six lower floors. Usually, goods resembling merchant's goods are brought in and out, so it is generally assumed to be a formal business, and no attention is paid to it. Yesterday was the fifth day of the abolished Lunar New Year, and all the shops opened in the early morning. Unexpectedly, at about 10:30 AM, a loud noise suddenly occurred in the lane, shocking the surrounding area. The nearby shops thought that a great disaster had befallen them, so they hurriedly closed their doors again. At the same time, the glass doors and windows of several shops were also shattered. For a time, there was a noisy uproar. After investigation, it was learned that the loud noise came from the Xinglong business. The entire house collapsed, and the walls of the neighboring Yufeng, Deyu Shenzhuang at No. 46, Hengsheng at No. 60, and the Jiading Textile Factory at No. 58 were all blown out. Before long, a fire suddenly broke out in the ruins of the Xinglong business, and the flames were raging and unapproachable. The lane watchman and the nearby patrolmen, hearing the alarm, immediately reported to the police station, which sent detectives to suppress and investigate. At the same time, the fire brigade dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the fire. It was then learned that all the men and women in the house had not escaped and were buried in the rubble. They quickly dug through the rubble and summoned ambulances to transport the injured to the hospital. It was not until around 12:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. At the same time, it was discovered that there were as many as eight casualties. ㈠ Tang Jijun, 28 years old, injured in both hands and feet. ㈡ Gao Guoqing, 39 years old, injured in the head and limbs. ㈢ Gao Tianji, 30 years old, injured in the shoulders and back. ㈣ Wang Yonggui, 31 years old, injured in the arms. ㈤ Shen Lindi, female, 15 years old, injured in both hands and shoulders. ㈥ Wan Wenxi, 28 years old, suffered the most severe burns all over his body and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. There were also ㈦ and ㈧ two men, one about 20 years old and one about 30 years old, who died on the spot due to their injuries and were sent to the coroner's office for examination. Their names are unknown and are being investigated. As for the cause of the fire and the collapse of the house, after careful investigation by the police, it was learned that it was caused by the explosion of several large boxes of alcohol stored in the business. The reason why the business stored alcohol was very strange. The police repeatedly searched and found several pieces of drug-making equipment in the business, indicating that it was secretly engaged in illegal activities. Therefore, they are currently pursuing the main culprits and investigating the internal organization in order to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Previously, the Shanghai Telephone Company had established a connection contract with the Telephone Bureau, charging five cents for each call. Now, after mutual consultation, it has been agreed that for calls originating from the company's lines, the company will receive one-tenth of the phone fee, and for calls originating from the bureau's lines, the company will receive five percent of the phone fee. The company had submitted this matter to the Shanghai Municipal Council for approval. According to the review by the Director-General and the Head of the Finance Department of the Council, this solution is not disadvantageous to the Council or general users. The Board of Directors has therefore approved the contract with the Telephone Bureau according to the conditions presented by the company.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Telephone Company believes that the previous quarterly billing method was not very economical and often resulted in bad debt losses. They propose to switch to monthly advance payments starting from April 1st of this year, aligning with the practices elsewhere. The Shanghai Municipal Council has approved this request.</p>

<p>Male Corpse Found on Tomb with Blood Flowing All Over</p>
<p>Female Corpse Found Lying by Riverside, Features Unclear</p>
<p>丨Tragic Incident in the Countryside of Hongzhen, Zhabei丨</p>
<p>Behind Chenjiazhai, east of Hongzhen on Linping Road, Zhabei, there is a solitary grave, rarely passed by pedestrians on ordinary days. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a scavenger passing through the area suddenly discovered a male corpse lying on the grave, head pointing southeast and feet pointing northwest. The man was about twenty years old, wearing a gray twill long gown, with a black cotton robe underneath, a blue striped wool sweater, white long underwear, black cotton-padded trousers, white socks, and black shoes. Blood was flowing all over the ground beside him, a gruesome sight. Upon seeing this, the scavenger was greatly shocked and quickly ran away. However, near a small river to the left of the grave, he suddenly discovered another female corpse lying by the riverside. The woman was about thirty years old, wearing a black cloth shirt, with a red cotton-padded jacket underneath, black cotton trousers, and a white striped cloth undershirt. Her features were unclear, with bloodstains all over. In an instant, the scavenger encountered these two incidents, and his soul was shattered. He screamed in terror and ran, acting like a madman. After running about a li, he finally reached the Hongzhen sub-station and urgently reported to the station. After receiving the news, patrol officer Tang Guangwen immediately led the police to investigate. Indeed, they found two corpses lying there. They also observed that the male corpse had a gunshot wound on the right forehead, while the female corpse had five or six knife wounds on the left neck and face. Although they inquired widely among the neighboring villagers, no one recognized them. Therefore, it was difficult to determine when the incident occurred. After inspecting the surrounding traces, it seemed likely that they were murdered elsewhere and the bodies were moved to this location. They conducted another detailed inspection and prepared a report to be submitted to the Linping Road sub-bureau, which would then be forwarded to the main bureau. At the same time, they ordered the local bailiff to conduct a preliminary examination and investigate the identities of the deceased and the details of the case in order to apprehend the culprits.</p>

<p>The late local detective of the French Concession Police, Gu Jisheng, ran real estate in Japan, accumulating more than 300,000 yuan. He owned a residence at 14 Pingjili Road and several rental properties. He married Chen, Guo, and Tan as concubines. Only Guo had three daughters, all of whom are married. Gu had no heirs, so in his later years, he adopted a son, named Wei Yi, who is now married and has children. Gu died of illness on the 13th day of the eighth lunar month of last year. All the property left behind was controlled by his adopted son, Wei Yi. Recently, Gu's great-granddaughter, Gao Rongqiaolin (35 years old this year, residing at 308 Boer Road, daughter of Gu's eldest daughter Genxiu, who married Rong Wenbin of Ningbo), claims that since her mother is deceased, she is legally entitled to inherit her maternal grandfather's estate. She claims that her maternal grandfather, Gu Jisheng, had a total estate of 348,000 yuan, and she requests that her uncle, Gu Wei Yi, allocate one-half to her. She hired a lawyer to send a letter to Gu Wei Yi, requesting a division, but Wei Yi ignored it.

<h3 id="e176">Record of the Joint Meeting of the Rice Groups of the North and South Markets <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The North and South City rice groups of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM on the 7th at the Cuixiutang Hall of the Yu Garden in the city. More than 160 members attended, including Lu Jingwen, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Zixiang, Wu Rongsheng, Fu Qiangeng, and Wang Tianchou. After the meeting began as usual, Chairman Lu Jingwen reported the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that since the establishment of our rice group last year, the achievements of the industry have been concrete and need not be elaborated. However, the commission is the main body of the business and should be discussed and decided. The commission should be in accordance with the existing regulations and should not be violated. If there is any trading done greedily or secretly, it will be punished for violating the industry regulations once discovered. The chairman proposed that he reluctantly serve as the group leader and, according to the agreed proposal, four departments should be established to cooperate and serve as the foundation of the rice group. Please discuss and decide. The four departments will be selected at the next meeting on the 20th, when the industry will be convened again for public recommendation. The outstanding balances of loans issued by the industry should be calculated in silver dollars, in accordance with the usual practice of various industries. Please decide publicly. It was decided that all outstanding balances collected by our industry should be in silver dollars and should not be reduced. It is stipulated that the store should pay foreign labor costs for sending money. This applies to cash. However, recently, stores often pay with term bills, which waste foreign labor costs. It seems that they can be cancelled. Please discuss the case and decide publicly. The foreign labor costs for term bills are cancelled. If cash is sent, the labor costs will still be paid according to the existing regulations. Whether there are any problems with the store accounts last year should be reported truthfully by the industry according to the regulations. Please do not conceal anything. It was decided that the association would notify the industry to report to the North and South offices within two days, and then review the measures. Zhu Geliangsheng of Shenli Bank reported that Xin Sheng Rice Store in Anqiao, Zhaoshi, owed more than 600 yuan in goods. Since the previous batch of goods had not been cleared, he came to apply for goods. If the goods are not continued to be allocated, he will use the excuse of donating to withhold the payment for the goods. Now it has been dragged over the New Year, and he still refuses to pay. It is difficult to reason with him. This meeting should be arranged to deal with the case. It was decided that if the store does have such behavior, do not trade with it according to the regulations. If there are still similar stores, they must also report to the North and South offices for review within two days. An industry report: Xi Zhenqing, the manager of Taixing Store, which went bankrupt last year, is now a shareholder and manager of Xin Tai Store. However, the manager bears joint and several liability. He should be dealt with according to the regulations. It was decided that since the manager of Xin Tai is Xi Zhenqing, the manager of Tai Xing, he will not be allowed to trade until the debts of Tai Xing are cleared. Also, if Shen Tongsheng, who buys goods, goes to the market to buy goods, he should also be dealt with according to the regulations and not be allowed to trade. All members of our industry should abide by this uniformly. Hu Wenan of Yishunjiu Bank reported that Shen Ruigen, who bought goods from Zhuang Hexing, which has gone bankrupt, has now opened Tongyu Rice Store west of the Laozha Bridge on Beijing Road and is also the manager. Should he be allowed to trade under the association's regulations? It was decided to suspend the transaction until he has cleared the debts of Zhuang Hexing, and then trade with him. Shi Shengbupu of Ruikang Bank reported that Gu Anbo, who bought goods from Yulong, has now formed Defeng Rice Store. Can he trade? It was decided that of course it would be difficult to trade with him until the debts of Yulong are cleared. Subsequently, Chen Taiqian, Xie Kangyong, and Shuntai reported that Yuansheng has not returned the payment for goods and has been dragging it on past the New Year. They also reported that Feng Shunyi, Yuanren, and others have paid with checks for the New Year. How should they be dealt with? It was decided to deal with it in the same way as the Xin Sheng case. The industry should report to the North and South offices and discuss the solutions together. It was decided that the industry would resume business on the tenth day of February.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Attorney He Sui Accused of Embezzlement <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Attorney He Sui was recently prosecuted by Mao Tianshui of Ningbo in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for embezzlement and requested to be investigated according to law. The court, based on the complaint, summoned him yesterday by Judge Li Changnian in Criminal Court 2. First, the plaintiff Mao Tianshui stated that he was a merchant who opened the Mao Maotai Wood Shop at No. 1595 Jing'an Temple Road. Due to market influences, he was short of funds and had to close the business. He was introduced by his friend Chen Bingkun to hire attorney He Sui to represent him in the liquidation. At that time, the official fee was 100 yuan and the clerk fee was 15 yuan. Later, he sold the shop base to Mao Shangxian for business, priced at 1,400 yuan. The debts were shared equally, but only one creditor, Chen Shuchang, totaling 413 yuan, did not agree to a discount. Therefore, the merchant had no choice but to raise funds from relatives and friends. Mao Shangxian issued a check for 413 yuan from the China Reclamation Bank and handed it to attorney He to entrust him to transfer it to creditor Chen Shuchang for receipt. Unexpectedly, He did not transfer the money, so creditor Chen Shuchang filed a lawsuit against the merchant in court. When I questioned He, he claimed that the money had been used for official fees. In this situation, attorney He clearly committed the crime of embezzlement. Please investigate and deal with it according to law. Then, witness Chen Bingkun stated that when the plaintiff's shop closed and was liquidated, I introduced him to attorney He. I was also present when the plaintiff handed over the money to He and saw a check being handed over. Mao Shangxian stated that the check returned by the plaintiff to Chen Shuchang was actually issued by the merchant. The first time, the name of the check was Chen Shuchang, the holder. Attorney He stamped it and went to the bank to collect the money, but it was returned because the name did not match. So he exchanged it with me again. The name on the check was Attorney He Sui. There is a first returned check as proof. Please examine it. When asked, the defendant He Sui did not arrive. A lawyer arrived on his behalf, claiming that He went to the local court to appear in court, so he did not arrive. He requested a postponement. The official said that the defendant submitted a statement of defense and a counterclaim for slander. After issuing a copy to the plaintiff, he ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Check Case of Pirated Robbery Transferred to Local Court <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Between December 6th of last year, the Xinhai Gate Steamboat was robbed by pirates on the high seas, and passengers were kidnapped and held for ransom. At that time, a passenger from Taizhou named Wang Wanhe received a Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation check for 100 yuan with number 238966 from a woman. Wang came to Shanghai and went to Wang Xingji, a fellow villager who ran a carpentry business on Qingyun Road in Zhabei, asking him to go to the branch on Broadway to cash it. (It was discovered that the check was lost by an employee of the Anglican Church Council under the jurisdiction of Ningbo Yin County, Zhejiang Province, and a telegram had been sent to cancel it). The bank telegraphed the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Huang Guangqi to secretly arrest the two Wangs and send them to the First Special District Court. After several interrogations, Wang Wanhe was ordered to be detained, and Wang Xingji was released on bail, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, recounted the previous events. However, the Yin County Procuratorate sent a letter stating that it would not transfer the case, and the person who lost the check never appeared in court to testify. Wang Xingji, who was released on bail, did not appear. Lawyer Li stated that the case occurred on the sea, within the jurisdiction of Yin County, and since the case was not being transferred, it should be sent to the inland authorities. Judge Wu ordered that the case be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for review. Wang Wanhe was allowed to be transferred to the Civil Detention Center, and Wang Xingji was notified to surrender himself to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate.</p>

<p>The book "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" is the most proud work of the "Sick Man of East Asia" (i.e., Mr. Zeng Pu). It has long been a household name. I believe we can all recall the author's lengthy conversation a month ago, explaining the origins of the protagonist Sai Jinhua's story, which was published in the newspapers. Ms. Sai was indeed a famous figure during the庚子 year. She often rode in and out of the palace with General Waldersee, the leader of the Allied Forces, with officials bowing their heads. Now, she is old and frail, living in the old capital. The glory of the past is like a dream. Readers who savor this book cannot help but feel emotional. The book also narrates many anecdotes and interesting stories from the Qing Dynasty, full of humor. The delicacy of the writing and the transcendence of the style are particularly noteworthy. The original manuscript of the book has sold more than ten editions, totaling over 200,000 copies, which is already unprecedented. Later, Zeng Pu revised the entire book, making it even more exciting. Now, a third edition of the revised book has been published. The entire book is divided into three parts, forming a large, thick volume, beautifully bound in Western style. The actual selling price is only one dollar and twenty cents. The general distributor is the editorial department of the Shanghai Great Evening News, and all major bookstores in various regions are selling it.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We read in the news column of your newspaper on February 8th that the City Government will inspect the smallpox vaccine sold in the city, which stated, "It has been found that the four brands of smallpox vaccine sold in Hankou, namely Qilin, Triangle, Zhongxi, and Fushou, have been tested and found to be ineffective." We would like to clarify that the Zhongxi brand mentioned is not the smallpox vaccine brand produced by our company. It is obviously a counterfeit. The product produced by our company is the "Nine Star Brand Smallpox Vaccine." The one sold by the Hankou branch is also the Nine Star brand. We are deeply afraid that the outside world will not know the truth and will easily misunderstand. We hereby solemnly request you to correct it. Sincerely, Promotion Department, Zhongxi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., February 8, 24th Year.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We read in your newspaper's news column of this city on the 8th of this month, "News from various fellow villagers associations," "Carrying a news of a meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee to thoroughly investigate member Wang Chengbao and others' accusation of the Director of the First Section," which is untrue. Recently, our association discovered a leaflet distributed to members. The content of the leaflet, bearing the name of Wang Chengbao, is that of a deceased member. It is obviously fabricated slander, of the same nature as an anonymous posting. Moreover, the joint meeting of our Executive Supervisory Committee was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 7th of this month to discuss the leaflet incident. It was unanimously agreed that "Director Zhang's morality and reputation are trusted by the society. Since taking office as the Director of our Association, he has achieved excellent results, which are admired by fellow villagers. This kind of unintentional action is not enough to damage Director Zhang's reputation. Moreover, what it refers to has no value whatsoever. It should be ignored. Please Director Zhang do not mind," etc., recorded in the minutes. There was no meeting scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on February 10th. We request your newspaper to correct it to show the truth. We hereby inform you and hope that you will handle it accordingly. Sincerely, Standing Committee of Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, February 8th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I have read the column about the improvement of the porcelain industry in Jiangxi Province on page 15 of the fourth sheet of your newspaper on the 7th of this month. It said that a reporter from the National Society visited me and said that the Jiangxi Provincial Government decided to establish a large-scale porcelain company called the Guangda Porcelain Company in order to improve the porcelain in Jiangxi Province, with a registered capital of 7 million yuan, jointly operated by the government and merchants, with the government holding 2 million yuan, determined by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the merchants holding 5 million yuan, which will be raised in Shanghai and is expected to be raised within March, etc. It is true that I am in charge of the Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Company, but the registered capital is 1 million yuan, with the Jiangxi Provincial Government contributing 200,000 yuan, and the rest will be raised by me, not limited to Shanghai. I have only published a message once in the New Life Weekly that I run, and have not spoken to any reporters. I do not even know what the National Society is. This news is obviously based on hearsay and is untrue. I request you to correct it. In this country with a backward industry, there is no new production news that can be published. The reporter from the National Society may have used this small porcelain company to exaggerate the story and arouse the attention of the people. The intention may be good, but all the news is said to be from my mouth, which is related to personal credibility. Moreover, I have always advocated pragmatism. Such a false show of strength is also tasteless. I hereby request the editor of your newspaper to quickly correct it. Sincerely, Du Chongyuan, February 7th evening.</p>
<p>To the Editor: In the news item in your newspaper on the 8th of this month, "Notice from the Tobacco and Salt Industry to Fellow Businesses to Distribute Inspection Scales," it was stated, "Kerosene scales, now manufactured by the City Inspection Bureau (divided into two, four, and eight taels, each set for six corners), will be distributed immediately, and all businesses must collect them for inspection." We would like to clarify that our office has never manufactured or distributed any weights and measures, nor has the Industry Association sent the scales to our office for inspection, nor has our office conducted inspections. Moreover, the legal unit of measurement for liquid measuring instruments is liters, 合 (ge), and 勺 (shao), which is inconsistent with the Association's use of斤 (jin) and 兩 (liang). Please publish this letter to correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures Inspection, February 8th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Chief Editor of Shen Bao: We, the Qian Tai shop, are writing to you. In the local news column of your newspaper on the 7th of this month, a news article was published titled "Lawsuit for Imitating Star Brand Coffee and Tea Trademark," which stated that Qian Tai Confectionery Company intentionally sold counterfeit Star Brand coffee and tea, etc., which is inconsistent with the facts. Our shop has been open for many years and has never committed any illegal acts. The counterfeit Star Brand coffee and tea were brought by a partner from a closed company in Guangzhou to peddle. On that day, the shop's accountant was busy entertaining guests because his child was one month old, so he mistakenly recognized it as a product of the Guangzhou company and accepted it due to oversight. Although a fine was imposed, we are not willing to accept it and are now appealing according to law. It concerns the reputation of our shop, so we are writing this respectful letter to request you to truthfully correct it to reflect the facts. We look forward to your assistance and wish you good health. Sincerely, Qian Tai Shop, north end of the vegetable market in the French Concession, February 8th.</p>

Initially, the Black Eagles were behind 10 to 11, trailing by one point. Kong Guangyi made three long shots, bringing the score to 16 to 12, taking the lead.

<p>From the start of the second half, Donghua showed a sudden surge in energy, breaking through and charging, with excellent coordination among the three forwards. As expected, they scored three consecutive baskets, tying the score at 28 each. Then, Xiang Long scored, immediately pushing the score to 30 to 28, giving Donghua the lead over the Black Eagles. Subsequently, the score became 33 each, and then 37 to 36, with Donghua ahead by one point. Xiang Long was then ejected for four fouls. The Black Eagles did manage to tie the score at 41. However, Feng Nianhua scored four points consecutively, and Kong Guangyi, the main player, was also fouled out. The Black Eagles were ultimately unable to recover, and the final score was 52 to 44, with Donghua winning.</p>

<p>The French Physical Society has been established for more than sixty years and has more than 1,300 members, all of whom are contemporary physicists. In addition to officers such as the president, vice president, secretary, and accountant, its organization includes a board of directors, which plans all the proceedings of the society. The board of directors has a total of 24 directors, with one-third being re-elected each year. Among the eight newly elected directors this year, two are non-French citizens: one is Professor Kapltza of Cambridge University in England, and the other is Dr. Yan Jici, director of the Institute of Physics of the Peiping Research Institute. Among the old directors who have completed their terms and are leaving this year, there are also two non-French citizens: one is Professor Gerlach of the University of Munich in Germany, and the other is Professor Lyman of Harvard University in the United States. It is said that there is still one Asian in the current board of directors, namely Professor Raman, an Indian physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1930.</p>

<p>School Address: Jumen Road, Nanshi</p>
<p>All Expenses are Waived</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association attaches great importance to popular education. In order to concentrate efforts and save funds, the Board of Directors has decided to continue operating the First People's School and to establish it as a permanent institution. The Executive Director Huang Zaoxiong has been appointed as the principal. The school is located at Zhangjiabang, Jumen Road, Nanshi. The enrollment is tentatively set at 50 students. Registration will take place from the 25th to the 28th of this month, and classes will begin on March 1st. Uneducated men and women between the ages of 16 and 50 can register and enroll in the school. Students currently studying at other schools will not be admitted. Tuition is free, and books and stationery are provided by the school. However, students must find a guarantor to fill out a guarantee form and pay a deposit of one yuan at the time of enrollment, which will be refunded upon graduation as a form of restriction. Students who are expelled for violating regulations or withdraw from school for no reason will have their deposits confiscated. The graduation period is set at four months, with two hours of classes per day, tentatively scheduled from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. In addition, the association has launched a weekly publication called "Citizen Life" to train the general public in civic knowledge. It is divided into sections such as commentary, common sense, literature and art, and current affairs news, targeting workers and shop apprentices as readers. The first issue is scheduled to be published on the 16th of this month.</p>

<p>In order to promote Mandarin education, the National Mandarin Education Promotion Association has designated this year as the Mandarin Construction Year and decided to do one type of work each month. In February, it launched the National Radio Station Mandarin Lecture Series, with education directors and Mandarin experts from various places giving lectures on local radio stations. Except for Sundays, there will be lectures every day. On February 1st, the Minister of Education gave a lecture at the Central Radio Station in Nanjing, stating that "Writing is the foundation of national revival, but Chinese writing is difficult, not easy to learn, and inconvenient to use. Therefore, this Ministry has promulgated phonetic symbols and Mandarin Romanization to help literacy. Phonetic symbols and Mandarin Romanization should be learned and used not only by students at all levels and the general public, but also by intellectuals, so that they can be closer to everyone and revive the nation." On the 2nd, Cai Yuanpei, the president of the association, gave a lecture at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, advocating for "(1) Primary school textbooks should not use classical Chinese, but Mandarin. (2) Textbooks for popular education should all use Mandarin. (3) Phonetic symbols should be added next to the Mandarin characters. The initial textbooks should use phonetic symbols only, without referring to old characters. (4) Teachers must have received Mandarin training." Yesterday, Zhao Yuanren, a director of the association, gave a lecture at the Central Radio Station in Nanjing, stating that the living intonation can be divided into three types: tone, central intonation, and expressive intonation.</p>

<p>Promotes English Speech and Mathematics Testing Competitions</p>
<p>Primary School Also Emphasizes Extracurricular Activities to Assist Learning</p>
<p>Zhiren Yong Women's Middle School on Seymour Road, Weihai Road, which has already started classes this week, held its first memorial week. Principal Xu gave a report and teachers gave speeches, and awards and prizes were given to the top three students in each grade. Among them were Shen Xirui, Shen Dezhen, Zhang Huizhu, Zhang Yuee, and Wan Shifang, who were awarded scholarships by the school for their outstanding academic performance. In addition, High School Class 1 won the championship trophy for overall grade performance. It is reported that the school has invited English teachers Sun Tingbi, Fan Guodong, and Cao Youmin as consultants for organizing the English speech competition, and mathematics teachers Wan Jingtao, Tian Jiabing, and Zeng Peian as consultants for the mathematics knowledge test. Since the elementary school attached to the school adopted the grading system, it has added notebook forms and diaries, which are corrected by the teachers of Elementary Grade 6, Zhang Qiongling, Elementary Grade 5 Dong Shuyi, Elementary Grade 4 Ying Xiao'e, Elementary Grade 3 Wang Chengxin, Elementary Grade 2 Hang Huifen, and Elementary Grade 1 Shen Jian. It is planned to publish it once every half month and prepare for achievement exhibitions, parent-teacher meetings, performances, and other programs. Since the expansion of the school building, the classrooms and fields of the primary and secondary schools have been very spacious, so there are still vacancies in each grade of the primary and secondary schools. It is reported that those who have registered for the exam recently are still very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Mr. Xue Guangqian is going to Italy to study and has been commissioned by the Executive Yuan to investigate rural economy in Europe. He is scheduled to set sail on the Conte Verde on the 13th of this month. Various party, government, military, agricultural, business, and academic groups in the city believe that Mr. Xue has made significant achievements in serving the society. His ambition to study abroad this time is very great, so a joint farewell party will be held at Xinghualou on Sima Road at 7:00 PM tomorrow (the 10th) to send him off. More than 300 representatives of various groups have registered to participate. Tao Baichuan, Chen Kecheng, Chen Jicheng, Zhu Xuefan, Sun Mingqi, Ren Xianqun, and others are preparing everything. At that time, anyone who knows Mr. Xue is also welcome to participate temporarily. It is reported that Mr. Xue has always been interested in the Chinese news industry, and the Chinese Cultural Construction Association of this city has also commissioned Mr. Xue to investigate the European news industry for observation.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Report of the National Labor Exhibition General Review (3) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>(C) Civil Engineering Department Achievement</p>
<p>The various subjects within the scope of civil engineering, such as river and sea engineering, sanitary engineering, and road and bridge engineering, have student achievements that are inconvenient to transport and cannot be compared with other ordinary works, where the completion of one piece can be submitted to the exhibition as an achievement. Therefore, the number of civil engineering exhibits at this exhibition is far less than that of other parts. Among the civil engineering achievements submitted by various provinces and cities, the library design drawings of the Civil Engineering Department of Shanghai Jingye Middle School, the Danyang Lianhu Lake Consolidation Plan (model) of Danyang Private Zhengze Elementary School in Jiangsu Province, the surveying and material testing reports of the Civil Engineering Department of Zhejiang Advanced Industrial Vocational School, the wooden bridge model and several measured maps of the vicinity of Anhui Province of Anhui Provincial First Secondary Vocational School, the steel model of the Civil Engineering Department of the High School Engineering Department of Hunan Private Chuyi Middle School, the projection geometric model and bridge, roof truss, culvert and other models of the Advanced Civil Engineering Department of Fujian Provincial Fuzhou Industrial Vocational School, etc., can all reflect the school's spirit and organization of teaching, as well as the students' usual experiments and design. They are quite commendable, but among these exhibits, there are more models and fewer design drawings and planning reports, which is not without its shortcomings. Because the achievements of civil engineering students that can be displayed at exhibitions actually belong to the latter two items, while models are a tool to aid teaching, not formal achievements of civil engineering students. This is quite different from the labor work of primary and secondary schools. During the next exhibition, schools should be instructed to pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e229">(D) Dyeing and Weaving Department <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The dyeing and weaving department was originally one of the industrial education specialties. In China's commercial ports, the dyeing and weaving industry is oppressed by the import of foreign goods, and most of the manual occupations of this industry have almost no possibility of existence. Therefore, the vocational education facilities and teaching of this department are particularly difficult. At this exhibition, there were not many dyeing and weaving exhibits. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which are known as the most developed dyeing and weaving areas, had very few exhibits. The three provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Hunan had richer exhibits, with remarkable achievements. The ability of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Chahar provinces to utilize local raw materials for research and manufacturing is particularly commendable. The carpets in the orphanages of Xi'an are especially unique. The northwestern provinces have abundant raw materials and lower wages. This type of manual dyeing and weaving industry is very necessary to promote and has great prospects for development.</p>
<h3 id="e230">(E) Applied Chemistry Subject Results <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>1. General Assessment</p>
<p>In this exhibition, the applied chemistry exhibits were roughly divided into pottery, glass, printing, leather making, soap, paint, cosmetics, stationery, porcelain, paper, and other items. The exhibiting schools included 31 vocational schools and 7 middle schools (due to the special nature of Xiangshan Orphanage, it is classified as a vocational school). Many exhibits are locally sourced and cater to local needs. However, some exhibits are blindly copied or are impractical conglomerations. To improve the efficiency of vocational education, schools should focus on specialized training to achieve excellence in the future.</p>
<p>2. Specific Assessments</p>
<p>A. Special Exhibits Category: Includes items of a unique nature or those with too few entries for meaningful comparison.</p>
<p>(1) The glass from the Jiangsu Provincial Suqian Vocational School's Glass Department and the pottery from the Jiangsu Yixing Ceramics Vocational School both utilize local materials and have achieved excellent results.</p>
<p>(2) Although the exhibits from the Hubei Provincial Vocational School's Printing Department are of a general applied chemical industrial nature, since no other schools submitted printing exhibits, they are included in this category for comparison. The results are also considered excellent.</p>
<p>(3) The porcelain from Jiangxi and the lacquerware from Fujian (both chemical industries) were assessed.</p>
<p>Although these were not initially included in the applied chemistry category, given their long-standing reputation, they are specially highlighted.</p>
<p>B. Comparable Exhibits Category: Includes items with a sufficient number of entries for comparison.</p>
<p>(1) Leather Making: Leather making had the most applied chemistry exhibits, with over 20 exhibiting schools, demonstrating the position of the leather industry in vocational education and the promising future of the leather industry. Many schools have achieved noteworthy results, with the leather making departments of the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology Affiliated Vocational Department, the Beiping Advanced Vocational School, and the Suzhou Middle School Chemistry Department being particularly outstanding, especially the Institute of Technology's Affiliated Vocational Department.</p>
<p>(2) Soap: Soap making is relatively easy to practice, so many schools submitted exhibits. Among the perfumed soaps, those from the Hebei Provincial Baoding Advanced Vocational School were the best. Among the bar soaps, those from the Suzhou Middle School Chemistry Department were the best.</p>
<p>(3) Paint: Seven schools submitted paint exhibits, with those from the Hubei Provincial Vocational School being relatively superior.</p>
<p>(4) Cosmetics: In cosmetics manufacturing, the raw materials and blending methods are crucial, and external packaging is also highly relevant. Among the exhibits, those from the Hunan Provincial Vocational School were the best. Schools researching cosmetics should focus on the manufacturing of raw materials and the blending of solvents. Simply purchasing ready-made raw materials, solvents, and packaging and then blending them is a waste of time and effort and is not economical. This is specifically mentioned for reference.</p>
<p>(5) Stationery: Stationery includes ink, printing ink, chalk, paste, stencil paper, etc. While there were many excellent exhibits, they are less important from an applied chemistry perspective.</p>
<p>(6) Porcelain and Paper: Porcelain and paper are both unique inventions of our country, and the paper industry is particularly significant for culture. The number of exhibits in this exhibition was small compared to other applied chemistry categories, and there were no outstanding results, except for the porcelain from Jiangxi. This is specially mentioned to draw attention to the vocational education sector.</p>
<h3 id="e231">(F) Business Subject Results <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The number of commercial schools exhibiting at this labor exhibition was extremely small. Regrettably, the results from Shanghai, which is recognized nationwide as a commercial center, were lower than those of other provinces and cities. The areas from commercial schools that we can observe include accounting, statistics, typing, and advertising. Reports generated from accounting books can show the income, expenses, and financial condition of agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises. Charts and graphs created based on statistical methods can show the production and sales situation of agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises, and their economic position among domestic counterparts. Typing and advertising are auxiliary tools for promoting agricultural and industrial products, and are unique subjects for commercial schools. Although the submissions from various provinces and cities touched on accounting, typing, statistics, and advertising, only a few achieved excellent results. Accounting is a particularly important subject, but there was no presentation of good results. The poor results from commercial schools is an undeniable fact. There were more statistical charts and graphs with good results, excluding those from the Zhejiang Education Department, Fujian Education Department, and Qingdao Municipal Government, which were not subject to criticism. The comparative charts produced by the Hangzhou Women's Commercial School, the agricultural product index charts produced by the Shanxi Mingxian School, the comparative charts produced by the Beiping Municipal Advanced Commercial School, and the price index table produced by the Anhui Provincial First Vocational School were all well-organized and worthy of study. This labor exhibition included various light industries such as agricultural products, textiles, embroidery, pottery, and woodwork, lacquerware, and heavy industries such as machinery, in significant numbers. However, the cost and output statistics of the products and the comparisons over the years were not specified, which is a shortcoming. Only the Shanxi Mingxian School provided detailed statistics on the output and soil distribution of agricultural products over the years, using indices and charts, which is highly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e232">News from Various Schools <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commercial Night School: The number of students at the commercial night school established by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce increased to 1,400 last semester. Enrollment for the current semester has begun. Li Quanshi, Yang Yinpu, Yao Qingsan, Li Wenjie, and others have been newly hired as professors. The specialized course level is equivalent to a university specialty and follows the Ministry of Education's regulations, requiring 72 credits for graduation. It is currently divided into banking and accounting departments. In addition, a specialized accounting course is co-organized with accountant Xu Yongzuo, divided into elementary and advanced classes, each graduating in two semesters. High school and school graduates can enroll without examination. Tuition is 20 yuan per semester for the elementary accounting specialty and 25 yuan for all others. The general course is divided into ten classes, with sessions in the early and late groups. The early group is from 6:45 PM to 8:15 PM, and the late group is from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM. Graduates of the general course are equivalent to senior high school. Tuition for the first to fifth classes is 11 yuan for the early group and 9 yuan for the late group, and for the sixth to tenth classes, it is 13 yuan for the early group and 11 yuan for the late group. In addition to the specialized courses, the elective courses include: (1) Chinese language class (3 semesters), (2) Japanese language class (2 semesters), (3) Bookkeeping class, (4) Improved Chinese bookkeeping class, (5) Mathematics class, divided into geometry and algebra groups, (6) Chinese typing class (graduating in three months per term), and (7) Correspondence class, designed for those who cannot attend school regularly due to their work.</p>
<p>Minguo Girls' Middle School: Since being approved for establishment, the school affairs of Minguo Girls' Middle School on Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road have progressed daily. This semester, due to the large number of students, there are plans to establish two departments to expand the school. To select talent and focus on teaching, the school has published advertisements to recruit teachers, showing its seriousness. The school opened yesterday, but there are still vacancies in various grades.</p>
<p>Hudong Commercial Vocational Middle School: Hudong Commercial Vocational Middle School on Baker Road has specially established a public scribe service and a common knowledge guidance center, providing free services. It also allows residents near the Ant and Shenbao libraries to read and inquire during their spare time, which has been very beneficial. The founder of the school, Mr. Chen, has set up 40 free places for the children of poor workers in the Eastern District.</p>

<h3 id="e234">The Most Economical Shortwave Transmitter <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xianwen</p>
<p>Manufacturing and Economics that Best Suit Amateurs</p>
<p>Recently, I often see many styles of transmitters in magazines. At the time, I felt itchy in my heart. Although I wanted to try it, I was disappointed due to economic constraints. Recently, I tried a most economical method, costing only a few tens of dollars, which can create a transmitter with an output capacity of more than 5 watts.</p>
<p>The oscillation part of this machine is not much different from what is usually seen. The only difference is the power supply part; and the most economical is also this part. Ordinary power transformers must be purchased ready-made, or they must be made by yourself. But buying ready-made goods is expensive and does not fit the tastes of amateurs. Then you have to make it yourself, but the difficulty is winding the wire; because the transmitter requires a very high screen voltage, if you want to wind a half-wave rectified high-voltage coil, you need two or three thousand turns, and most of the ordinary ones (ie small transformers) use about No. 30 or so thinner wires, so it is even more difficult to wind. If you add a primary coil, you need to wind three or four thousand turns in total. This is nothing to comrades who have automatic counting winding machines, but we have to think about how many comrades have the above conditions? So to say that winding a coil of three or four thousand turns will give anyone a headache. Now there is the following method, comrades will not have a headache, because you only need to wind two thousand two hundred turns to get four hundred volts of "B" voltage, isn't this a very cheap thing! And the entire power transformer costs no more than four yuan at most, so it can be said to be extremely economical. First, let's talk about the transmitting part:</p>
<p>The circuit of the transmitter adopts screen-grid tuned (T.P.T.G.), which is easy to adjust and has stable frequency, which is most suitable for beginners to test. The grid circuit capacitor can be omitted (not shown in the figure) and replaced with a movable coil, so its frequency is still variable. The circuit of the transmitter is shown in Figure 1. All the parts used in the whole machine, except L1, L2, and L3, need to be made by yourself, and the rest are old goods removed from the radio. L1 and L2 are made of B.&amp;S. No. 12 bare copper wire. (Note 1) Except for L3, L1 and L2 are wound with gaps, and the gap is equal to the diameter of the wire (ie 2.053 m.m). L1 is wound with six turns. The relationship between the number of turns of L2 and L3 and the frequency is detailed in the table below:</p>
<p>Coil Coil Diameter Number of Turns Frequency (K.C.) L2 21/2" 20 1750</p>
<p>L2 21/2" 8 3500</p>
<p>L2 21/2" 3 7000</p>
<p>L2 21/2 2 14000</p>
<p>L3 1" 150 1750</p>
<p>L3 1" 60 3500</p>
<p>L3 1" 25 7000</p>
<p>L3 1" 9 14000</p>
<p>In the figure, C4 is two 0.004 MFD fixed capacitors. Because they are radio-style and cannot withstand higher voltage, two are used in series here, and the voltage received by each is halved, so that there is no danger of short circuit. In addition, the circuit is simple, and there is no need to say more, everyone will know it: As for the adjustment of the transmitter, I think the readers must be much better than me, so I don't need to say it here. Let's talk about our power supply below.</p>
<p>This power supply can be divided into two parts, one part is the rectifier part (that is, "B" voltage), and the other part is the filament current supply. The entire power supply is supplied by four doorbell transformers. The author uses: domestic Ma brand doorbell transformer (of course, other brands are also available, but you must know that its input power is indeed 10 watts). Although the selling price of this transformer is the same, the goods are often different (Note 2), you must pay attention when buying. After the transformer is purchased, you can start the winding work. First, disassemble the transformer and remove all four secondary coils. The transformation method of T1 and T2 is the same, both use B.&amp;S. No. 30 enameled wire to wind one thousand one hundred turns as the secondary coil of T1 and T2. (When winding, do not separate the first layer and the second layer with thicker insulation, for fear that it will take up too much space, so that the coil cannot be wound down) In application, you must use it in reverse, that is, the original primary is used as the current high-voltage secondary, and the original secondary is used as the current primary, but what you must pay attention to when connecting is: the two 1100-turn primaries (according to the current saying) are connected in series in the 220-volt circuit: the secondaries are connected in parallel. After the coil is wound, the original iron sheet can be inserted. There are gaps left in the iron sheet of this kind of transformer (for heat dissipation). Now when applying it, you must find some black iron sheet (most of the comrades who make transformers themselves will have this kind of black iron sheet. If there is emery steel sheet, it is even better), fill these air gaps to increase the cross-sectional area of the iron core. On the surface, it seems that you cannot use it as said above, because the original primary is two hundred and twenty volts, and the changed secondary is fifty-five volts, how can you connect the fifty-five volt secondary coil to a one hundred and ten volt circuit? The reason is that when manufacturers make doorbell transformers, the primary (two hundred and twenty volt coil) is always connected to the two hundred and twenty volt line, and the doorbell switch is connected in series in the secondary, so the number of turns in the primary is often more than what is usually calculated. Moreover, the cross-sectional area of the iron core is now doubled, so it is okay to connect its fifty-five volt coil to a one hundred and ten volt line.</p>
<p>After T1 and T2 are wound, you can start winding T3 and T4. The number of turns of these two is also the same (if 45 oscillation is used), both use B.&amp;S. No. 16 enameled wire to wind fifty turns; T4 can also be wound with No. 18 wire, but for the convenience of purchase, you can use No. 16 for both. After the four transformers are wound, they can be connected according to the circuit in the second figure, and the entire transmitter is completed.</p>
<p>Parts used in the whole machine:</p>
<p>L1, L2, L3, the manufacturing method is detailed in the text.</p>
<p>C1¨·0005Mfd ordinary large 23-piece variable capacitor one</p>
<p>C2¨·00025Mfd fixed capacitor one</p>
<p>C3¨·006Mfd fixed capacitor two</p>
<p>C4¨·004Mfd fixed capacitor two</p>
<p>R1¨ depends on the vacuum tube used. If 75 is used, R1 should be 50000</p>
<p>R2¨ center-divided resistor, 20 when using 45</p>
<p>R·F·C· high-frequency choke coil used in ordinary radios</p>
<p>V1¨45 vacuum tube one</p>
<p>V2¨82 vacuum tube one</p>
<p>T1, T2, T3, T4¨ doorbell transformer four</p>
<p>A·F·C·30H, 60m·a· low-frequency choke coil one</p>
<p>C5¨2Mfd voltage-resistant 1000V· paper fixed capacitor two</p>
<p>Note 1: The reason why L1 and L2 use bare copper wire is (1) cheap. The copper wire used in several bands of this machine is less than half a catty in total. Compared with copper tube, the price of copper wire is tens to one. (2) Because the transmitting power is small, the efficiency of using copper tube and copper wire is almost the same, so it is more appropriate to use copper wire</p>
<p>Note 2: Not long ago, a friend bought this kind of transformer and tried it at home. Although it was not loaded (noload), it heated up by itself after about thirty or forty minutes, probably due to short circuit or EddyCurrent.</p>

<p>— Hua Xin</p>
<p>(1) Short wavelengths have excellent transmission efficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Short wavelengths have little absorption during transmission.</p>
<p>(3) Short wavelengths have almost no interference from atmospheric electricity.</p>
<p>(4) Small power and small antennas can be used for long-distance communication.</p>
<p>This point can be easily deduced from the characteristics of (1), (2), and (3). In fact, only a very small power of 5 watts to 10 watts can be used for very long-distance communication, and the amount of power is almost unrelated to the distance. What is related to long-distance communication is only the stability of the oscillation frequency.</p>
<p>(5) The communication wavelength band (frequency band) increases, and multiple communications can be performed at the same time.</p>
<p>(6) Directional communication is easy to implement.</p>
<p>The above points are the characteristics of short wavelengths, and its shortcomings are:</p>
<p>(7) Oscillation frequency is easy to change.</p>
<p>(8) Radio tuning is more difficult than long waves.</p>
<p>(9) Due to power limitations, it is inevitable to be disturbed by noise.</p>

<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Outside the west gate of my hometown, less than a mile away, there is a particularly large mound, towering up and covered with weeds, like a small mountain. This mound is octagonal, with each side paved with stone blocks, and it is impossible to tell which side is the front and which side is the back. Because it looks like the eight trigrams, the villagers call it "Eight Trigram Tomb."</p>
<p>It is said that the descendants of this Eight Trigram Tomb were very prosperous in the late Ming Dynasty, and they enjoyed wealth and glory. Because this Eight Trigram Tomb is shaped like a steamer, there were houses all around it, with smoke rising from the chimneys, resembling a steamer being heated up, with vigorous hot air. Therefore, the descendants of the Eight Trigram Tomb all prospered, becoming wealthy and glorious. In the Qing Dynasty, the residents next to the tomb all moved into the city to live, thus breaking the feng shui and cooling down the steamer; therefore, the descendants of the Eight Trigram Tomb all declined. That's what my friend said.</p>
<p>Oh! This is actually the tomb of Zhao Wenhua, who was very powerful during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty and was attached to Yan Song. When Song was in power, he was called a powerful traitor. Although Zhao Wenhua was a member of Yan's party, he was very active in his hometown, such as building the county town and building Jia Yi Ting, and was willing to serve his hometown. Therefore, even though the villagers despise him, they still call him "Bright Traitor." They say he is a traitor, but his brain is not confused, and he is ultimately better than the current "Chinese traitors" and "traitorous merchants." That's what I said to my friend.</p>
<p>In less than four hundred years, Zhao Wenhua's descendants have truly declined to a regrettable state! Indeed, it is hard to find a few Zhao families in the entire county, and they are very poor. Now, near Nanmen, there are still two stone lions squatting outside Nanmu Hall. It is said that Nanmu Hall was Zhao Wenhua's old residence. Last year, I met a vagrant on ×× Road in Shanghai who was begging me pitifully. It is said that this vagrant is indeed a descendant of Zhao Wenhua. My friend said this to me again.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but sigh, and had no other reply.</p>

<p>This place is a bottomless pit of money! It's a place of decadence! But the bourgeois young men and women, the big clerks of company foreign firms, the fat-bellied merchants with huge assets, the young masters and playboys who squander money like dirt, and those... all flock to it like ducks! Yes, they seem to have lost their souls! As if they have gone mad, as if on the eve of the earth's explosion, everyone is reveling and anesthetizing themselves here.</p>
<p>The dazzling "hua cha hua cha" of banknotes are competing to be stuffed into the hands of the person sitting on the high stool behind the counter, stuffed, stuffed, thus exchanging for red, yellow, green, and gray dog ​​tickets. When the bell rings, the electric rabbit rushes out of the wooden box and flies along the surrounding iron track. The group of dogs wearing "dog clothes" of different colors on their backs are chasing closely behind it. They are chasing, chasing, and thousands of eyes are all focused on them, emitting sparks of hope!</p>
<p>The lights judging the victory or defeat are on! The winners show a smug smile, and the losers show a frustrated look, and then throw away the dog ​​tickets. Then, the "hua cha hua cha" of banknotes are vying to be stuffed into the hands of the person behind the counter, stuffed, stuffed...</p>
<p>Like this, time after time, the "track owner's boss"'s pockets are stuffed full, full. However, on the other hand, a large number of people who seem to have lost their souls and were once crazy here, some are ruined! Some have become drifters on the street! Some have even committed suicide because of this! Some...</p>
<p>But after one group leaves, a new group comes. However, this new group will, in the near future, replace the previous group and become ruined, drifting, and suicidal. ...</p>

<p>Chapter 8: Remote Place, Light Official, Far Away, Strong-Willed Order, Magnificent Hall Banquet, Outside There Are Pitiful Worms</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as he was hesitating like this, the woman behind him sobbed and covered her face with her sleeve, crying. Naturally, Jie Fu couldn't help but be stunned. He was thinking that Zhu Yueying was a girl he greatly admired, so he shouldn't offend her. Under the moonlight, although he couldn't show a smiling face to others, he couldn't stand straight in front of them either. So, he slightly bent his waist and smiled, "What's wrong? Did my words scare you?" Yueying recognized him. Now that things had come to this, being shy was no longer an option. She turned her head, looked at him, and said, "This is my mother. No one has ever said such things to her. You, sir, keep pressing us to ask questions. She's too embarrassed and has to cry. Sir, she's a villager. Please have pity on her and don't force us." As she spoke, her voice couldn't help but become dry and she couldn't speak. Zhang Jiefu had never encountered such a thing before. He hadn't said a single harsh word, but he felt that every word he said was stabbing at people's hearts. He smiled and said, "Then you misunderstood me. Under the moonlight, I didn't know it was you two. Oh! Yes, I remembered something. Mr. Cheng wants to find something for you two to do. Did you know?" Although the woman had stopped crying, she didn't say anything and continued to rub her eyes with her sleeve. Yueying said, "Thank you, we already know." Jie Fu was left speechless by her reply. However, he felt guilty for having forced her to cry, so he said to her, "The people who are coming to eat haven't arrived yet. Even Mr. Cheng is still sitting in his own room. You're standing here waiting under the moonlight. When will you stop? Why don't you come to my room and sit for a while?" Yueying said, "No, my mother is afraid of people." Zhang Jiefu couldn't say anything more. After standing for a while, he resumed pacing back and forth under the moonlight with his hands behind his back. (129)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Regardless of the truth of the matter, the Tongzhi Empress certainly took her own life. At the time of her suicide, she was almost ten months pregnant. The last bit of bloodline left by the Tongzhi Emperor perished with her. (Translator's note: The assertion that the Tongzhi Empress was pregnant is actually inaccurate. It was created out of indignation towards Cixi's despotism by people at the time who felt sorry for the Empress and deeply resented Cixi's autocracy, thus increasing Cixi's culpability. However, this claim also appears in "Empress Dowager Cixi: An Intimate History" by Englishman Backhouse, which many readers consider an anecdote.) Although no one knew whether the unborn child was a boy or a girl, if it had been a boy, the Tongzhi Empress would have been revered as Empress Dowager after his birth, and our Old Buddha [Cixi] would no longer have such a good position and such high authority. Therefore, the death of this unborn child along with his mother was truly a great advantage for the Old Buddha! Writing this, I can't help but think of four pitiful middle-aged women who live almost in another world, whom no one ever notices. Perhaps they cannot see anyone at all. Although they live with us in the palace, they are like prisoners, forever confined in a very secluded courtyard, never allowed to go outside all year round. I suspect that, except for death, they can no longer have any contact with the outside world. So, who are these women? They are the concubines of the Tongzhi Emperor. When the Tongzhi Emperor passed away, they were still young women with black hair and rosy cheeks. The Empress Dowager refused to let them out, but did not want to see them either, lest it arouse their sorrow for Tongzhi. Thus, she locked them up in the deep palace as if burying them alive, until this very day. (239)</p>

<p>— China United Press</p>
<p>Prince Guo, the sixth son of the Kangxi Emperor of the late Qing Dynasty and younger brother of the Yongzheng Emperor, toured Sichuan and Kang areas in the fourth year of Yongzheng's reign. He resided in Dajianlu for about ten years, and then took the daughter of the Ming Zheng Tusi (local chieftain) as his concubine. It is said that the Tusi of various places in Xikang are all descendants of Prince Guo. The Tusi of Xikang are mostly of the Jia and Mu surnames. Some say that splitting the character "Guo" (果) into two yields those characters, thus asserting they are descendants of Prince Guo. Because Yongzheng cruelly killed his brothers, Prince Guo dared not return to the capital and stayed in Xikang until Yongzheng passed away, when he returned to court to report. When the news of Yongzheng's death reached Xikang, Prince Guo observed mourning and slept on grass in Lijiang County. Therefore, Yajiang still has the Wolong Stone (Sleeping Dragon Stone), which is a relic of that time. Prince Guo lived in Kang for a long time and knew the customs and conditions of the people well. His work, "The Stroke of the Pen," describes the customs of Xikang in great detail. Here we explore and record it to show a general picture of Xikang customs.</p>
<p>(1) Wandering thousands of miles, going west out of the furnace pass to the end of the sky, the mountain path is majestic and steep, the sound of the water is ferocious and roaring, willow branches sprout in April, there are no splendid flowers, only mad winds, regardless of dusk or dawn. Therefore, I strike out all the colorful splendor with a single stroke.</p>
<p>(2) Entering and exiting on fine steeds, accustomed to being lords of ten thousand households in the emperor's house, generations inheriting great favor, with official hats and belts passed down to sons and grandsons; meritorious deeds inscribed on Lingge pavilion, glory and wealth is enough, why bother holding scriptures to walk towards the literary arena? Therefore, I strike out the golden list of successful candidates with a single stroke.</p>
<p>(3) Shapeless sheepskin robe, always worn in all seasons, never discarded, white snow piles up thick on the mountains, cool breeze penetrates in midsummer: no need to seek gauze and Ge (coarse cloth), durable , a small bell rings, hanging on the chest, therefore, I strike out the brocade and silk with a single stroke.</p>
<p>(4) Head of a Ke Yao family, tea boiled with milk is offered in a bowl, highland barley wine from the barbarians, Zanba (roasted highland barley flour) and ghee; beef legs and mutton elbows, eaten with the fur, a whirlwind sweeps, eaten until nothing is left, therefore, I strike out delicacies from land and sea with a single stroke.</p>
<p>(5) Barbaric and remote frontier, people live in hundred-foot buildings, dogs of bereaved families everywhere, the smell of feces and urine fills the house, walls are piled with messy stones, colored flags in front and behind, a golden-topped flagpole, standing alone to the right of the door, therefore, I strike out painted beams and carved pillars with a single stroke.

<h3 id="e241">Record of Martial Arts Tuina Practitioner Jin Wentao <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlu</p>
<p>Our country has always valued literature and belittled martial arts, resulting in a weak and declining nation. Only a few ambitious people are willing to study, invent, practice, and teach martial arts. Because our country has been civilized for a long time, the achievements of martial arts are more profound and magnificent than those of other countries. Even in this era when our country is inferior to others in many ways, a Russian strongman came to Beijing to show off his skills, calling himself invincible in the world, but he was scared away by a Chinese woman named Yang who came from a remote rural area, which can be regarded as a consolation. It is a pity that there are martial artists with great skills in our country, existing like rare treasures, very few in number, unable to spread widely and cultivate a national spirit of martial valor, merely serving as something for people to marvel at their strange abilities after drinking and tea, creating an impression similar to myths!</p>
<p>Here, I am recording a martial artist named Jin Wentao. He is a Muslim and originally engaged in the jewelry business, traveling to and from Shanghai and Guangdong for many years, and also going abroad several times to Java and the South Seas, selling cheap and buying dear, his fate rising and falling repeatedly. However, when he was fourteen or fifteen years old, he unintentionally met an old man named Sha, who was also a Muslim, who taught him various martial arts. He devoted ten years of hard work to it before he felt he had achieved some success. Mr. Jin's work of sitting in meditation every night continues to this day without interruption: he sleeps very little, often using meditation instead of sleep, and his spirit is particularly strong. He never knew his master's name, only calling him Master Sha. He often provided financial assistance to his master until he saw his master's death, handling the funeral and mourning, because Old Man Sha had no family or close relatives, nor any other disciples. This also shows the strangeness of his master's origin and the beauty of the meeting between these two disciples!</p>
<p>Although Mr. Jin is skilled in martial arts, his appearance is very refined, and he also works in the business world. Even those who are close to him on a daily basis do not know that he possesses martial arts skills. He himself is deeply hidden, unwilling to reveal his abilities in front of others. Even so, more than a decade ago, someone would come from afar to visit him, saying they sought instruction out of admiration. After he repeatedly declined and pleaded to be excused, he had no choice but to approach the visitor with a humble attitude and sparred with him in a secluded location. After only a few exchanges, he kicked the visitor to the ground, defeating him and sending him away.</p>
<p>After middle age, Mr. Jin grew weary of the travels and hardships of business and settled in Shanghai. Some people advised him to set up a school and teach students, but he said, "I still have some other skills to make a living, which are more beneficial than teaching martial arts." Therefore, he practiced medicine using Tuina massage. Now he is still located inside the alley diagonally opposite the Yunnan Road Hot Spring Bathhouse, to serve those who are ill.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Financial News: Pre-Lunar New Year Foreign Exchange Strangely Loose, Post-Holiday Gold Market Plummets <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The Short Selling Camp is Extremely Firm</p>
<p>Final Drop of Eleven Yuan and Seven Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the sharp weakening of foreign exchange during the Lunar New Year holiday and the extremely firm position of the short selling camp, the gold market suffered a miserable plunge due to downward sentiment. However, there was sudden support after the drop, and eager short covering, resulting in a mediocre situation. During the Spring Festival holiday, overseas silver markets rose across the board. Coupled with the sharp hardening of the foreign exchange market before the holiday, the unofficial gold price had fallen to 51 yuan, and sentiment was extremely weary. There were also rumors in the market that the Sino-British loan had already been finalized, which, coupled with the unexpected loosening of foreign exchange over the past two days, seemed credible. As a result, pre-market trading fell from 54-55 yuan to 51-52 yuan. However, because there were quite a few people taking the opportunity to cover their short positions, and rumors of non-cashable "balance coupons" resurfaced, prices immediately rose back to 57-58 yuan. The central bank's official rates were announced, with both British and American currency rising, and customs gold falling back. After the opening, the chips were loose and low, and major players all entered the market to take advantage of the low prices, gradually pushing prices up. Suddenly, banks began selling again, and the foreign exchange market remained loose. HSBC's official rates also lengthened, eventually leading to a fall. Then, due to strong buying from major players taking advantage of the low prices, and the longs also adding leverage, there was still a rebound. The silver balancing tax was announced to remain unchanged. Afterwards, banks continued selling, but became slightly weaker, but due to short covering, prices rebounded after falling. Sassoon and HSBC continued selling shillings, and the underlying trend became flat and weak. The midday situation was one of hesitation, and the afternoon market opened flat, with even quieter trading. The underlying trend was prosperous, with demand exceeding supply, gradually pulling prices up, but still struggling. Indian silver fell slightly, and banks lacked a selling appetite, resulting in a tighter domestic market, and prices rose again. However, retail investors took the opportunity to unload their positions, and the supply of funds increased after the rise. Even with Guangbang's short covering, it was still difficult to sustain, and prices gradually fell downstream, eventually stabilizing at the close. Overall, the day's market was still mediocre, with only the unofficial market experiencing more volatility, and trading was not active. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 955 yuan and 8 jiao, a drop of 12 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the close before the holiday. It then rose to 6 yuan and 3 jiao. Dalianbang at Fayong scattered many for sale, falling back to 3 yuan and 8 jiao. Fuxing Yongheng, Yufu, Yu Yuanmao, Yong Da, Fayong, etc. came in to buy, gradually rising to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. Mitsubishi and Citibank then sold March US dollars at 0.0625. Dadecheng and Dalianbang Chang Da, Yuanheng sold, falling back to 4 yuan and 8 jiao, anticipating that HSBC's official rates would rise by 25 for British currency and 5625 for American currency. Although Fuxing Yongheng Yu advanced to 6 yuan, Hua Bi sold February US dollars at 6875 and shillings at 625. Yuan Yi, Chunyuan, Yongyuan, Chang Yongheng, Yu Qian, Changxiang, Dafa, Yonghongxing sold a lot, falling to 3 yuan and 2 jiao. However, there were quite a few limit orders coming in to buy at low prices, allowing the price to be maintained. Hanh Heng, Yuan Mao, Yong Fu, Yu Ding, Kang Yongli, Dadecheng, Fusheng, Yongheng Yu, Chang Da, Yu Qingyong all took advantage of the low prices to come in, gradually rising to 5 yuan and 4 jiao. Zhengjin sold March US dollars at 125. The silver balancing tax was announced to remain unchanged. In the market, Ding Kang, Heng Yu, Zhaofeng, Chang Chang Da, Dadecheng, etc. all sold, falling back to 3 yuan and a half. Afterwards, seeing the low prices, although buying was eager, Sassoon continued selling shillings, and there was still much hesitation. Later, Wanchang, Yong Fu, Yu Tong, Taichang, Fuxing, Yong Shun, Mao Yongli came in to buy, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and rebounded to 6 yuan and a half.

<p>Yesterday, February 8, was the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year for the Chinese Securities Exchange. After a week-long holiday, the final accounts have been settled. Although three or four money houses in the city declared liquidation, it can be said that it was a stable passage. The government's organization of a Currency Preparatory Committee happened to coincide with the fact that most of the short positions were held over the New Year, so when the market opened, it saw a sharp rise. March futures also began to enter the market yesterday, and the first round opened high across the board. Market demand was quite eager, and the first round rose by 3, 5角, with the 23rd customs duty rising the most, by 8, 9角. Among them, numbers 43 and 46 were the most actively bought, and in the second round, number 43 bought approximately 200,000 in troop reductions for this month, sharply raising the price by another 5 jiao and a half. Confidence returned to stability. However, there was quite a bit of short-covering in the market, and the near-term continued to rise, while the far-term was relatively weak, and the 23rd customs duty rose sharply again by 7 jiao and a half. The North Bang also bought eagerly, and the trend was extremely good. The market was closed in the afternoon, as is the usual custom.

<h3 id="e246">Yarn Market Remains Quiet and Weak After Holiday <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>A Small Portion of Yarn Mills Have Not Yet Resumed Operations</p>
<p>The yarn market has been closed for several days for the winter holiday. Today is the day of the five roads according to the old lunar calendar, and the market has opened for trading. However, the market is unusually quiet and without any new developments. In previous years, there should have been a lively atmosphere. The reality is that the social and financial situation is in decline, and the environment was harsh last year, with many silver houses collapsing. The market has suffered a major blow. Fortunately, the overseas cotton industry is stable and quiet, and confidence can still be maintained. The Shenxin Factory has not yet been listed. It is said that several factories are still being reorganized, and the cotton yarn of the Shenxin Factory that is being traded on the market is all being sold by yarn merchants.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls by One Yuan and Two Jiao and Three Fen The market was mostly discussing and expecting a slight increase in prices before the auction of yarn before the market opened, because there was not much change in the overseas cotton industry during the few days of the closure, and several yarn factories have not yet resumed operations due to the impact of poor business conditions. However, the拍出各个月 all showed a weak trend. Unfortunately, too many money houses collapsed last year. It is said that銀钱尙难安定 to this day. Therefore, there are not many new buyers in the market, and there is a lack of vitality in business. Japanese merchants continue to sell, and prices are falling round and round. As a result, each had an average drop of 6, 7, 9 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was红盘 trading of actual yarn, but other than the Cantonese helping to sell smoothly, other interests were flat. The bidding time for the auction yarn was not long, only 50 minutes, and it was over. The various months fell by another 4, 5, 6 jiao. It was查卖出长丰 1,850 bales,赓丰 400 bales,长余 400 bales, 　大 400 bales, 大丰 900 bales, 同兴 600 bales, 润康 500 bales. The进是源大 1,550 bales, 明德 700 bales, 瑞大 400 bales, 永昌 1,550 bales, and穗隆 40</p>

<p>The sales of yarn are still good. The demand from both the Guangdong and Fujian merchants in the southern ports is relatively brisk. A survey of the total purchases made by various merchant groups throughout the day amounts to 1,197 bales. The market prices are similar to last year. The purchase amounts of each group are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market has been closed here for several days. Overseas Indian and American cotton are both stable, but Indian cotton is still rising by several rupees. However, the price of gold has fallen back by more than ten yuan, and the yarn market is weakening. It is heard that several factories, due to the sluggish market, have not been able to resume work as usual, and morale is relatively low. Japanese merchants and the Ningbo group are both selling off, and the market price is becoming more and more slack. The market remains sluggish and lacks vigor.</p>

<p>The opening of the forward cotton market shows a tired state in all months. The market situation remains lackluster and still scattered, indicating the decline of business. However, overseas Indian and American cotton markets are uniformly rising, and morale has not been stirred. Moreover, yarn factories have not yet fully resumed work, the price of gold has fallen back, and there are very few new buyers. Prices for all months have fallen by one to two and a half jiao. The afternoon market conditions remained flat. Japanese merchants and the Ningbo group sold more heavily. Only Yuan Da purchased approximately 6,900 dan short. Da Fu bought and increased its position. As a result, prices for all months fell again by five fen to one and a half jiao. A survey of sales shows: Da Feng sold 1,200 dan, Geng Feng 1,000 dan, Chang Feng 5,600 dan, Yuan Xingchang 5,400 dan, Chang Feng 2,000 dan, Heng De 1,000 dan, Yi Cheng 1,500 dan, Run Kang 3,200 dan, Yong Chang 1,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with flat conditions, and prices for all months fell by one to three points. The market was stagnant, and speculators were still awaiting the outcome of the gold bar case. Subsequently, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, foreign merchants sold off, and bulls in the March contract liquidated their positions, continuing the downward trend. In the afternoon, dealers, local groups, and New Orleans all leaned towards buying, and at the same time, there were not many sellers, so the market showed stability. Spot inquiries were better, and transactions were normal. The textile industry faces a dim future due to competition from Japanese goods. The closing was firm, with spot prices rising by five points and futures prices rising by one to six points. English cotton was sold by the Mumbai group, and dealers absorbed it. Spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices rose by one to three points. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 7th):</p>

<p>More than 40,000 Bags Opened Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quite active. Due to being closed for many days, inland demand was strong again, and the river docks in this city had not yet opened. This street also has a good appetite, and a total of 33,000 bags of spot goods were opened in the market, as well as 2,000 bags of goods en route. High-grade rice led the rise by about one jiao, while broken rice was sold to inland areas and for disaster relief, with a large increase of two jiao. The main destinations were inland areas and disaster relief households. The stock of foreign xian rice is relatively thin, and production prices are high, so the market is more optimistic. Yesterday, inland demand was extremely strong, with 8,700 bags being purchased. This street only handled 300-400 bags of rough rice. However, due to the small stock and large outflow, polished rice and red rice each increased by three jiao, rough rice also increased by two jiao, and other types increased by one or two jiao each.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Imported Wheat Affects the Flour Market, Wheat Plummets <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for all months showed a uniform sharp decline. The price of imported wheat, since the market closure, has fallen nearly six jiao in Chicago and two to four jiao for distant months, and about two and a half jiao in Canada (it has rebounded on the 7th). When pricing, the price of imported wheat naturally made people nervous, and the combined price of spot imported wheat is still cheap. Various factories are purchasing one after another due to demand. It is heard that another ship of Australian wheat was ordered the day before yesterday at a price of 4.82 yuan. As for the various road merchant groups, because they are in the early stages of disaster relief, they have little interest in purchasing. Therefore, the market atmosphere is slack, and various factories are selling off, causing prices for all months to fall step by step. Considering the current trend of imported wheat and the continued tight money supply, there is little hope for a rebound in the future. As a result, the price for this month fell by four fen, March by five fen seven li and a half, April by six fen two li and a half, May by five fen seven li and a half, June by four fen and a half, and July initially opened at four jiao four fen seven li and a half, and closed at four jiao one fen, also a decrease of three fen seven li and a half. Furthermore, the flour exchange will only operate for half a day in the morning from the 8th to the 13th, and will resume normal operations from the 14th onwards.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months showed a uniform sharp decline. The price of imported wheat fell by two to four and six jiao in Chicago and about two jiao in Canada. When the market opened in the morning, with the decline in prices of imported wheat futures and the continued selling of spot imported wheat, and given the current situation where the price of imported wheat is still cheaper than local wheat, many external bulls sold off as soon as the market opened, and the market plummeted endlessly. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the sluggishness of the flour market and a portion of imported wheat being hedged, the market atmosphere remained depressed. Transactions were brisk in all contracts. Considering the recent trend, with continuous orders for imported wheat, there is little hope for a rebound. As a result, the price for this month fell by one jiao two fen, March by one jiao six fen, and April by one jiao four fen. Spot wheat saw no trading yesterday due to inactive factory demand.</p>
<p>The settlement of long positions in overseas Chicago wheat has been abundant, and there were slightly more purchases today, but the exchange's open interest is the smallest since July of last year.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Weak and Miserable Market for Miscellaneous Grains <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market was the first trading day after the major settlement. Due to unfavorable conditions on all sides and a lack of buying interest, the overall market situation saw price declines exceeding rises. Although there was some demand for soybeans from various groups, transactions were weak, so prices were lower compared to before the settlement. Yingzhou soybeans and Guide soybeans fell by nearly a jiao (the market price for a total of 2,700-2,800 bags was 3.80 yuan). Over 1,500 bags of Andong Xicheng soybeans were opened (please refer to the market price column). The market was stable, but the overall situation remained unfavorable. For the rest, such as mung beans and black beans, the market was stable due to the scarcity of goods. Sesame had a stable condition due to foreign firms. Peanuts and other grains showed a soft trend.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Sluggish Sales of Wheat Bran <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The wheat bran market is showing another downward trend. The sales market only sees slight interest from inland groups, while foreign firms remain quiet. Moreover, with the beginning of the accounting period, various factories are mostly offering transactions, so opening prices show a slackening. All factories uniformly open at 2.55 yuan. According to news from insiders, with the spring crop coming onto the market, the inland demand will definitely continue and be able to stand firm.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Sugar Market: Guangdong Raw Sugar and White Sugar Only Up One Jiao <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Five Blessings White Ice Sugar Up Two Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was the first trading day after the major settlement. Due to the rise in the Dutch exchange rate and the fall in customs gold, the trend for foreign sugar failed to improve. Dutch red sugar even showed a bearish trend. A batch of Guangdong raw sugar and white sugar was tendered yesterday, with the original amount being 3,000 bags. 1,380 bags were sold at 17.70 yuan, an increase of only one jiao. Dutch raw sugar and white sugar will arrive on the 11th, and 200 bags of transit goods were sold at 5.10 yuan. The current transit goods were sold at 5.05 yuan, slightly looser than before. There were no transactions in Dutch red sugar, and the market outlook is slightly bearish. Huipan had Jianbang Dalaihua brand open over a hundred boxes of standard Five Blessings white ice sugar, each piece at 17.80 yuan, up two jiao. Guangdong group opened several hundred bags of Huizhou white sugar at 17.40 yuan to 16.60 yuan. Chaoqing is expected to open tomorrow, with a potential increase of two to three jiao. The main fluctuations depend on actual sales.</p>

<p>Only One Quote Yesterday</p>
<p>This morning, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, the market opened as usual, but there were hardly any red pan transactions this spring. Customer firms wanted to use this to predict good omens for the year, so they wanted to sell their goods at a high price. However, with overseas market conditions being what they are, foreign merchants in Shanghai only sent telegrams to inquire about the market, and there were no transactions. Shanghai's sales of foreign silk must wait until after the 12th or 13th of the month, depending on whether there is a substantial turnaround in the market situation.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Tea Industry Slightly New Samples Sent Out <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of twenty tea warehouses in this city, including Road Warehouses, Local Warehouses, and Ping Shui Warehouses. Although some of them suffered losses due to the low tea prices at the end of last year, there was no major impact. Previously, due to the threat of bandits and communists in various tea-producing areas of southern Anhui, tea warehouses were hesitant to lend money. Now that the bandits have been completely eliminated, the attitude of merchants has become more stable. It is heard that each warehouse will continue its business as usual this year, with no major changes.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of trading after the general settlement. The foreign tea market remained quiet. Only Tianjin, Xiehe, and other firms in the city sent out slightly new samples of Luzhuang smoked Zhenmei green tea. The rest of the Gongxi Xiumei and other goods were completely ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e260">"Yuanbao Business" of the Woolen Cloth Group <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The Market is Adorned, Transactions Have Not Yet Begun</p>
<p>Yesterday, being the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, the woolen cloth industry welcomed the God of Wealth and opened the market at 1:00 AM. Sellers successively prepared samples and opened their stalls. Salesmen and brokers went out to solicit business. Buyers, out of courtesy, mostly selected and matched purchases as a token of support. This kind of initial transaction at the beginning of the year is referred to by both parties as "Yuanbao Business." For the most part, the prices were equal to the closing prices of last year. Because in recent days, the association's standard prices have not yet been agreed upon, buying and selling must still wait.</p>
<h3 id="e261">North-South Goods Prices, Key North-South Goods Rise <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>But Actual Sales are Still Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of North-South goods were negotiated and finalized. Most of them showed an increase. Among the South goods, Jinshan branches saw a greater increase. For example, glutinous rice branches increased by 30 to 40 yuan due to land prices. Round and flat branches also increased by 4-5 yuan to nearly 10 yuan. Dried longan increased by 1-2 yuan. Screened longan, except for the top grade, was mostly stagnant, while medium and small grades increased by 2-3 yuan. Among the North goods, the main goods also generally increased. Daylily increased by 1-2 yuan, Xiang lotus increased by 3-4 yuan, White lotus increased by 2-3 yuan, Wood ear increased by 5-6 yuan, Peach kernel walnuts increased by 3-4 yuan, Black melon seeds increased by 0.4-0.5 yuan, Top-grade pressed fruit increased by about 1 yuan, and the bottom grades saw little change. The remaining red and black dates, vermicelli, and other items saw more stable price changes. However, actual sales have not yet moved significantly. Whether the rising trend can be stable still depends on the rise and fall of demand. Yesterday, the market only saw sporadic transactions. Among the dried longan firms, He Feng, De Feng, and three or four others closed. There may be one or two more closing or changing owners. Among the North goods firms, there were four or five closures or reorganizations. Only a small number made a profit, mainly because last year, with the collapse of the rural economy, business was reduced and there were not many opportunities to profit.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Hardware: Hardware Red Opening Higher Than Last Year <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>The hardware red market prices were officially opened yesterday. The agreed-upon prices were all raised by several jiao to one or two yuan compared to last year's market prices, so it is expected that future transactions will inevitably be affected. The tight money supply and the desolation of the market are undeniable facts. If you don't find ways to promote sales and just think about the interests of one side, there will be no good results. Here are excerpts of the red board prices for the main items (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e263">Oil Market: Chaos in Both Shanghai and Hankou for Winter Cypress Oil <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The cypress oil production this winter was the lowest in western Zhejiang, and although eastern Zhejiang was slightly better, it was still not as good as previous years. The initial news from the Jingyi area of western Hubei was that it was a bumper harvest, but after verification, it was also lower than in the past. Therefore, all cypress oil production areas reported poor harvests, and the number of cypress oil produced was reduced considerably. Therefore, no area had a feeling of lack of oil in the winter supply. The most severe shortage was in this port. In previous years, we relied entirely on Zhejiang cypress oil. And Jiaxing, in western Zhejiang, is the closest to Shanghai, and the supplies arrived in the evening of the day they were dispatched, but because the harvest this winter was only 30%, there was concern that even local sales would not be sufficient, and there was no excess oil to be shipped to Shanghai. In addition, oil from Wenzhou and Taizhou also did not sell far because the price in the production area was too high. The Chen oil had run out in Jiangxi Province and the new oil also was only supplying local areas, so the sources on which this port relied were all cut off. Therefore, from the time the new crop was produced until the final settlement, only a few hundred pieces arrived. As a result, the lack of oil this winter was unprecedented. Moreover, before the end of the year, a certain soap factory purchased a large quantity in Hankou, causing the stocks in both Hankou and Shanghai to be extremely sparse. It is feared that the opening price of spring cypress oil from Jingyi will be above 21 yuan per piece.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Shoveling Away the Coal Slag <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Luo</p>
<p>The burning in a furnace, after a certain period, shows signs of decline. At this time, the bottom layer of coal slag should be removed, and some new, black and shiny pieces of coal should be added. Thus, the furnace becomes hot and vigorous again.</p>
<p>Literature is the same, shining with different splendor from era to era. When a society transforms into another society, two different kinds of literature are produced in society: one is energetic and upward; the other is decadent and downward. The former is the newly added coal, which is emitting a red glow; the latter is just the coal that is about to burn out, gradually losing its flames. Its result is coal slag, and this coal slag will inevitably suffer the fate of being shoveled away. In the early days of Romanticism, it was a burning piece of coal, and we could see that great, extraordinary, and sharp flame. Victor Hugo shouted in "Hernani": "Ah, the people! The ocean! The surging waves! ··· This wave that destroys thrones and shakes tombs!" However, the burning of coal will gradually disappear, and it will change from a red-hot flame to a dim light, and then become coal slag. The evolution of society also causes the "furnace" of literature to form a state of metabolism. Romantic literature will inevitably lead to Naturalism. At the same time, their youthful enthusiasm and flames gradually disappeared. They "want to escape from their era and go to the ideal realm of the past era (especially the Middle Ages), or the abstraction of life, as a place of concealment" (in the words of Iakovlevich). Thus, Realism became the negation of Romanticism and became the newly added coal, burning again in the furnace. Romanticism became coal slag and had to be shoveled away.</p>
<p>When a certain society is changing, new coal and coal that is about to become coal slag both exist in the "furnace" of literature. At this time, coal slag certainly has its inevitable fate of sinking, but it is still struggling and hindering the progress of the furnace fire from time to time. Sometimes, too much coal slag will dim the furnace fire, and even extinguish it temporarily. Therefore, in the progress of the times, the role of coal slag is to hinder the evolution of society. For the sake of the future of society, it is really necessary to shovel away the coal slag. However, some people still say: "Those literatures that are about to become coal slag are not our enemies. Instead of attacking them, we should appease them." Isn't this defending coal slag? Of course, coal slag also has its historical value. However, when coal slag hinders the prosperity of the furnace fire, we can only seriously attack and criticize them. In today's society, the low-level Saturday School novels are still popular, as are the multi-angle love novels, and there are even novels that specialize in writing about dancers, circuses, and decadence. But, undeniably, these are all coal slag! Coal slag is dimming the light of the furnace fire. For the sake of the future of literature, we must not only attack and criticize them, but also strive to shovel them out of the furnace, and even use water to extinguish their remaining flames!</p>

<p>— Zai Qing</p>
<p>Qian Shangying (Zhenzhi), self-titled Master of Suishan, historical details unknown. I once saw his essays "Collection of Purchased Sorrows" in four volumes, mostly based on the poems and lyrics of his predecessors, slightly referencing historical facts, or completely from imagination, evolving into novels, mostly two hundred characters long, and sometimes only dozens of words. Each volume has a preface engraved in his own handwriting, and a foreword. When I borrowed the book from a friend, I selected and copied two excerpts. One of them said: "When Jie Xisi was not yet successful, he traveled between Hunan and Xiang. One day, he moored his boat on the bank of the river. At the second watch of the night, he put on his clothes and sat outside, looking up at the bright moon as if it were daytime. Suddenly, a boat in the middle of the river gradually approached, and a woman in plain dress stood up, very elegant in appearance. Jie Xisi asked her, and she said, I am a merchant's wife. My husband has not returned for a long time. I heard that you were coming, so I came to greet you. So he talked with her, and they were very happy. Until dawn, he was reluctant to leave. He gave Jie Xisi a poem, saying, 'My family is on the Pantang River, come and have tea if you have time; the walls are made of yellow earth and the roof is covered with thatch, and there is a tree of purple lilac in front of the courtyard.' The next day, the boat was blocked by the wind, so he went ashore to buy wine. When he asked about it, it was Pantang Town. After walking a few steps, he saw a house with walls and a courtyard full of purple lilacs. A young boy was standing under the flowers. When he asked him, he said that the head of the family was away on a long journey, and his wife lived alone, and died after being ill for three years, and was buried in the back garden yesterday. Xisi went to see it and saw that the purple lilacs in front of the tomb were very lush. Xisi wandered around and couldn't help but wet the tomb with tears."</p>
<p>The second one is based on Cui Hu's peach blossom poem. In the entire collection, it is the best one. The text says: "Cui Hu initially failed to pass the imperial examination, and traveled alone to the south of the capital during the Qingming Festival, and found a village house with clusters of flowers and trees. Hu knocked on the door for a long time, and a woman asked him from the crack in the door. He replied: I am looking for spring alone, and I am thirsty for wine. The woman opened the door and brought a bowl of water. She leaned alone on the young peach tree and seemed to have deep affection. Cui said goodbye and sent her to the door, as if she could not bear it, and then went in. He never came again. By the time of Qingming the following year, he went straight to find her, but the door was already locked. So he inscribed a poem on the left door: 'Last year today in this door, peach blossoms reflected the red faces. Where have the faces gone now? The peach blossoms still smile in the spring breeze.'" "I don't know where the face is," here it is written as "the faces now", I don't know if it is based on another version, or if it is Shanghao's memory error.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he also reprinted other people's long works, such as Tu Long's "The Journey of Mingliaozi", this book transcribed the entire upper part. The one about Tie Xuan's daughter also differs greatly from the one recorded in "One Hundred Novelists". According to this record, it is said that "Tie Xuan was a chief administrator, and died for his country during the Jingnan rebellion. Both of his daughters were of national beauty. [Unreadable] was furious and ordered them to enter the Jiaofang. After several days of hard work, they vowed not to be humiliated. At that time, a colleague of Xuan's arrived, and the two daughters presented a poem to him," I don't know who is reliable. This book can be said to be a unique work in the notes of novels, but unfortunately there are not many good ones. The Ming carved version I saw has a good layout and font, but unfortunately there are many typos, I don't know if it was the owner's first carving.</p>

<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>丨A Retrospective of Daxing丨</p>
<p>Going to the mountains in the rain is a kind of happiness, although sometimes it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>That day, the rain was the kind that "refreshes the willows with green, like a traveler's inn," though I knew I wasn't exactly heading out of Yangguan Pass, I was still filled with longing. Perhaps it was a bit romantic. The name Daxing initially sounded a bit intimidating. Naturally, this was likely related to the old novels I had read. But let's not dwell on that.</p>
<p>Daxing Mountain, with such a resounding name, should itself be magnificent. It was hard to say whether this trip would bring extraordinary encounters. For example, heroes and immortals. Just hearing about them was enough to surprise people. (Back then) Grand floods, Shaolin, and two-hundred-year-old monks were showing off everywhere! So, without any preparation, I asked the host to call for a vehicle. Because I had nothing on me, not even needing to pack, I set off. It was truly very simple.</p>
<p>The driver was an elderly man nearing seventy, said to be an "expert" in this profession for decades. The vehicle was what they call a "sedan chair," often appearing in "The Travels of Lao Can"; southerners probably lack this sight, but there are plenty in the north. However, in recent years, it has been declining. Some places have already replaced it with cars and rickshaws. Although there are still quite a few in remote areas, they are just waiting for "time" to include them in history. The vehicle is called a sedan, but it is not a sedan. Apart from the wooden shaft of the carriage, you can't find any similarities. The vehicle has two wheels, with a diameter of about three feet, which is much more advanced than the "Taiping cart" and the hand-pushed wheelbarrow that can also run on the same track. It has a canopy, arched, covered with a curtain, much like the bamboo awning of a small boat in landscape paintings, only smaller. So no one drinks wine and enjoys the moon inside, which is a pity. The reason it's called a sedan chair, I think, is probably because it once showed off in officialdom, because the character is simpler than sedan, and it only needs to be hitched to a mule. It doesn't necessarily require four people to carry it. Moreover, that two-foot wide and three-foot long compartment, to be comfortable, can only be occupied by one person, which ordinary people can't afford. In addition, there are two positions outside the canopy. The "inside (i.e., left) position" belongs to the driver; the "outside position," also known as the "shaft," naturally belongs to the "second master" carrying the "visiting card box."</p>
<p>When this vehicle is heavily loaded, it needs two to three animals to pull it. If it's just carrying people, it usually only hitches a strong mule. The one I was in was the latter, a "single shaft." According to the locals, the most extravagant is a "double set," which is a moderate approach, but I don't think so. Look, if there is a follower on the "shaft," doesn't that look like a reserve official? As for needing a "double set," that already indicates retirement.</p>
<p>Fine rain was falling. A layer of oilcloth had been added outside the curtain, so guests didn't have to worry. The vehicle was moving on the damp, loamy road. The driver "hee-hawed" while urging the trained mule, and the mule was truly trained. No matter what, it never ran a step. When the whip struck, it would just shake its big ears unhappily, and a "trot-trot" sound would come from its nose, and it would go unhurriedly. This is very suitable for people who have no urgent business to attend to, and they can take this opportunity to browse the scenery along the way.</p>
<p>The distant mountains were hidden in the mist. Nearby small ridges and low hills undulated in the rain. By the roadside, water droplets condensed on the wheat fields, like celestial robes covered with pearls. The villages were misty. The green willows contained smoke. It was around the time of Qingming Festival, very suitable for having a Xinghua Village to buy wine. There was no trace of people on the road, which was very desolate. If it were a writer, he might as well ponder it. Unfortunately, my mind was dry, and I had no ability to mend the sky, and I couldn't squeeze out a bit of "poetic juice." Never mind, leave it to later generations. Fortunately, we don't lack "vague" poets.</p>
<p>The driver and his trained mule were so refined that they bored me. The vehicle rattled all the way, and I was already dizzy from the shaking. It seemed like it was still far from the station, and there was no rushing it, so I fell asleep. I don't know if I missed this ready-made picture in my sleep, but when I was awakened by the driver's scolding, the situation was very different. Although the sky was still covered with thin clouds, the rain had stopped. The small hills were even more cumbersome and trivial, and the main vein of Daxing was already in sight.</p>
<p>The driver stopped the vehicle, went to a stone house by the roadside to get tinder, and asked about the route. Only then did I realize that this old "expert" was not so expert after all, at least he still had to ask people for directions on this road. This road was originally a convenient route to Shanxi. The so-called convenient route means it's between a highway and a small path. At this time, several passengers had come down from the mountain, some with "shoulder poles" and some with loads, mostly agricultural products to be sold "down below." There was also wine from Shanxi.</p>
<p>The vehicle's next journey was terrible. The road was full of rocks, and the mule kept slipping and falling. It was not walking, but climbing. Sometimes the driver had to go down to hold it. As for the vehicle, it was simply a rickety skeleton. It rattled and shook all over, and sometimes it even showed off its martial arts, jumping to the side of the road with a "Kangcha" sound. You had to watch your head. By the time we reached the foot of the mountain, the birds had returned to their nests and the dogs were barking. It was almost dusk.</p>
<h3 id="e284">The Celebrated Jumping Frog (3) <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Li Bo, written by Mark Twain</p>
<p>Smiley had rat-terriers, chicken-cocks, cats, and all sorts of things, and you couldn't keep up with them. If you took something to bet with him, he could always match you. One day, he caught a frog, took it home, and said he was going to educate it. So, for three months, he did nothing but sit in his backyard, teaching that frog to jump. And I could bet that he was really teaching it. He would give it a little tap from behind, and the next moment, you could see it spinning in the air like a doughnut, flipping a somersault, maybe two if the angle was good. Then it would land flat on its feet, unharmed. He taught it to catch flies and kept it practicing. As long as it saw a fly, it could catch it. Smiley said that the most important thing for a frog was education, and it could do almost anything – I believed him. Oh, I had seen him bring Dan'l Webster here – that was the frog's name – and put it on the floor, calling, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" And before you could bat an eye, it would jump straight up, land on that counter over there, grab a fly, and then, as solid as a clod of earth, plop back down to the floor and start scratching the side of its head with its hind leg, as nonchalant as if it hadn't done anything more than a frog should do. You never saw a frog so modest and straightforward, even though it was such a genius. When it was given a fair start on a flat surface, it could jump better than any of its kind you ever saw. Jumping on a flat surface was its specialty, you know; if there was such a competition, Smiley would bet as much as he could afford. Smiley was extraordinarily proud of his frog, and he was right to be, because travelers from all over said it was superior to any frog they had ever seen.</p>
<p>Smiley kept this creature in a small square box and often took it to town to bet with people. One day, a stranger, a passerby in this area, came across him carrying this box and said to him,</p>
<p>"What's in that box of yours?"</p>
<p>Smiley, looking very indifferent, said, "Well, it might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, but it's neither – it's just a frog."</p>
<p>The man took the box, examined it carefully, and said, "Oh, that's it. So, what's it good for?"</p>
<p>"Well," Smiley said casually, without a care, "it's good for something, I'm sure – it can out-jump any frog in Calaveras County."</p>

<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>"Mother Tian, your chickens are getting bigger!"</p>
<p>"Are they getting bigger?"</p>
<p>Hearing people say that the chickens are getting bigger, Mother Tian is very happy. She likes raising chickens. The chicks she raises every year are all hatched from her own hens, and the breed is bigger than "oven-baked chickens." Chicks hatched by hens can be sold for four hundred coins each in town, and people in town like to buy them, saying that these chicks grow easily and don't die easily. Chickens sell for a good price, but Mother Tian never cares about these three or four hundred coins. She is happy to see her own hen hatch chicks. If you ask her to sell them, Mother Tian can't bear to part with them, so she never sells her chicks. For seven or eight months, Mother Tian feeds them all day, manages the chicken coop, and watches out for wild dogs. She is almost always paying attention to these chickens.</p>
<p>"Mother Tian, your chickens are getting bigger!"</p>
<p>Hearing people say this makes her happy. Sometimes she even catches the chickens and weighs them in front of people:</p>
<p>"Five days ago, this speckled chicken weighed two catties and three taels. Now it weighs six taels more."</p>
<p>Mother Tian's face is full of smiles when she weighs them.</p>
<p>Mother Tian loves chickens so much that she is more devoted than people who love dogs, flowers, or birds. One year, she raised more than twenty young chickens, and five of them were bitten to death by weasels. That morning, after finding five dead chickens at the entrance of the chicken coop, Mother Tian started to cry. Other people tried to persuade her, but she couldn't be consoled. After that, she wouldn't feel at ease even going to bed unless she personally closed the chicken coop door.</p>
<p>Once the new chickens reached the winter solstice, the males would crow, and the females would already be able to lay eggs. Mother Tian loves raising chickens and also likes the eggs that the chickens lay. From the day the chickens start laying eggs, Mother Tian can pick up eggs in the chicken coop every day. She puts them in jars and doesn't sell them unless she needs money. Although Mother Tian loves raising chickens and works hard to raise them until they lay eggs and crow, she never eats chicken meat except for a few eggs. She raises the chicks as if she were raising her own children and doesn't want to slaughter them. She would rather sell them to other people at the end of the year for the New Year.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, Mother Tian's family is always more strapped for cash than usual. She has no money, so she has to go to town to sell chickens. Every year, she only leaves two hens to prepare for hatching eggs next spring, and sells all the rest.</p>
<p>"We're out of oil and salt..."</p>
<p>Mother Tian worries.</p>
<p>"What about rice?" her husband asks.</p>
<p>"It's almost gone too. There's only..."</p>
<p>"Then sell chickens tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Every time Mother Tian hears these words, it's like cutting her heart and liver. She feels that her husband is a cruel and cold person. But for the sake of oil and rice, Mother Tian can't care about the chickens. She has to let her husband tie up the chickens' feet and take them to town to sell for money.</p>
<p>"Ooooooo..."</p>
<p>The chickens with their feet tied up cry.</p>
<p>Hearing the chickens' tragic cries, Mother Tian's heart trembles painfully. Like the tears of mourning for the dead, they hang from her deep eye sockets onto her cheeks.</p>

<h3 id="e287">An Examination of the Psychology of Peace and War <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun carried a dispatch from its New York correspondent stating that the weekly magazine Literary Review and the University News Association conducted a vote to understand the psychology of American students regarding the current world situation. The results showed that out of 32,500 votes, the majority favored peace.</p>
<p>To be honest, this kind of psychological examination can be said to be superfluous. Because the psychology of hoping for peace can be said to be shared by all beings with blood and qi. Those who advocate war and do not hope for peace are only a small number of ambitious individuals and a group of militarists who specialize in reckless lawlessness and disregard everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to examine the psychology of peace and war, not only will the results of American students be like this, but the results of non-student examinations will also be the same. Not only in the United States, but even in Germany and Japan, which are currently eager for success, if you examine the psychology of ordinary people, the results will be the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, the psychology of war and peace does not need to be examined. However, this psychological examination of American students has deeper and more complex significance. There are five questions in the examination, the most important of which are the following three: 1. Will the United States be able to avoid being involved in the whirlpool of war in the future? The results showed that the majority believed that they would be involved in the whirlpool of war. 2. If the United States is invaded by other countries, are you willing to take up arms and fight? The majority agreed. 3. Should we invade other countries? Or should we not invade other countries? The majority argued that we should not invade other countries.</p>
<p>The first question is whether the United States should join a possible second world war in the future. The current result is that the majority advocates joining, which seems inconsistent with the psychology of loving peace. However, we must know that the current world is a world of power. If we love peace but do not join, the next step is that the god of war will descend on our own heads. The so-called "killing to stop killing" is also a method that peace-loving people must take. The so-called "sitting at home behind closed doors, disaster comes from the sky," the inapplicability of the Monroe Doctrine to the present world, its trend can be seen in general.</p>
<p>Should the United States take up arms to resist if invaded by other countries? 2. Should the United States invade other countries? Or should it not invade other countries? 3. Such questions do not need to be asked of students with clear intellect. Even if you ask children two or three feet tall, they will definitely answer crisply "take up arms and fight" and "should not invade." Why is this? This is called a universal principle and humanity of the human race. Assuming that this point is obliterated and acted in reverse, although it may not be impossible to show strength for a time, the result will eventually lead to failure. Even if it does not fail, it will only be a country that destroys humanity and destroys public morality, and will never be condoned.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Festivals <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>The situation is obviously very different from before.</p>
<p>In the past, whenever a festival was coming, people welcomed it with very joyful hearts. Everyone was busy preparing for the festival a few days in advance. And on the day of the festival, everyone was especially happy to celebrate the festival. At the same time, everyone also invited a few like-minded friends to get together and have fun drinking. It felt like every festival was the best time to relax and enjoy oneself.</p>
<p>And every shop was crowded with people. The shop assistants were too busy to handle it all. The boss sat in the back of the counter, smiling and stroking his beard. Even along the street, there were layers upon layers of fish vendors' stalls, and people surged back and forth like a tide. When they went out, their hands were empty, but when they came back, everyone was carrying a load of festival goods.</p>
<p>Now, this kind of lively scene has disappeared.</p>
<p>Although the fish vendors' stalls are still laid out all over the street as usual, the shops are still open as usual, and people are still bustling and coming and going as usual. But people's expressions are different. They are all gloomy, as if they will never see a smile. The shops are deserted, with few people. The shop assistants are bored, and the boss is no longer smiling, but is irritable and frowning, and sighing from time to time. The fish vendors' stalls have no business for half a day, and every customer seems to have suddenly become stingy, arguing about the price even for half a copper coin. As a result, they often run away.</p>
<p>—— The year is not good! It's getting worse every day.</p>
<p>The shop owners and the fish vendor owners both sighed at the same time.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the street are equally crowded, but most of them are just going out to stroll around with their eyes, and returning home empty-handed.</p>
<p>—— Celebrate the festival!</p>
<p>—— Celebrate what festival? It's simply getting through a difficult time.</p>
<p>The voices that were spoken in the past were loud and clear, but now they are low and carry a hint of desolation. In the past, everyone was happy to mention it when they met someone, but now, not only does no one want to mention it, they are even afraid of hearing this voice. In the past, they wanted to buy more things to celebrate the festival, but now they are planning how to save money. It would be even better if they could save it all. When the festival is near, many debts are pressing at the same time. Everyone's heads are dreaming of gold day and night. However, everyone has no livelihood, no income at all. But they have to take care of eating and drinking every day, which has already made them unable to straighten their backs. Add to that the burden of the festival, and they can't even breathe.</p>
<p>Beaten by the pain of reality, life is getting harder and harder every day, and they are feeling the attacks of life with panicked hearts. When a festival comes, people's hearts become tense, struggling to barely get through it. They take a breath, and then there is another festival following closely behind. Countless festivals are forever threatening people with fierce and merciless terror.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Lonely Years <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Dani</p>
<p>Living in loneliness, twenty lonely winters have sent away my youth.</p>
<p>Living in the near suburbs of the city, two lonely companions lived together; but in the autumn of falling leaves, my lonely friend left me. Accustomed to living a lonely life, I welcome this twenty-first lonely winter.</p>
<p>What my friend left behind here is a photograph of us together.</p>
<p>I glanced at him habitually - we can communicate our thoughts in loneliness, move the rattan armchair to the side of the stove, and brew a pot of Longjing tea. I close my eyes driftingly, as if my lonely companion is sitting opposite me; shaking his legs, chewing the taste of Turkish tobacco, the blazing flames kiss me, and I am misty pulled back to the season when chrysanthemums are in full bloom.</p>
<p>(Let's toast our newly added lonely comrades, finish this cup!</p>
<p>From then on, brilliant flowers bloomed in this lonely cellar. A clinging little bird shook our two lonely hearts.</p>
<p>In the morning, facing the golden sunlight, we waved goodbye at the bus stop, and the heavy work seemed to be lightened. Facing the golden sunlight again, we returned with smiling faces. We cooked fragrant rice on the gas stove, made various dishes by hand, and made life light and comfortable.</p>
<p>On nights when the bright moon was overhead, we stepped on our long shadows, blocked the autumn wind, and roamed the banks of the nearby small river. Or we rented a small boat and boating under the moon, and sent away the twenty lonely years like my youth.)</p>
<p>Dream!</p>
<p>Throwing away the cigarette butts, savoring the bitter Turkish taste, the two lonely companions are sitting opposite each other in the photo.</p>
<p>"When you were attached to the little bird in your arms, did you ever raise your glass to toast the lonely old comrades?"</p>
<p>I am lonely facing it, naturally it is a lonely answer!</p>
<p>A burst of trivial sounds rang out, it was two beads hitting the glass window, it played moving music with the flames in the stove. Drinking Longjing tea, I smiled victoriously; people who make a living in loneliness have long been deprived of that kind of light and comfortable day!</p>
<p>Slowly, the glass window became covered with mist, and the clanging sound seemed to fade away gradually. There is no moonlight in the sky, I don't know what kind of world is a piece of misty black night?</p>
<p>The lonely rainy alley, send a sob of singing, is it a lilac girl?</p>
<p>"It's the bitter old man who died of his daughter! The lonely companion said softly in my ear.</p>
<p>Really! That day we came back from boating, we saw him playing a hoarse erhu alone, singing Meng Jiangnu's song "The first month is the New Year" in a false voice.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>He told us that his companion – a lilac-like girl – had died, and selling songs alone was lonely and not doing good business!</p>
<p>Our little bird pitied him and sent him two dimes, saying: "Old man, buy a dime of beef and a dime of wheat wine to spend this lonely night!"</p>
<p>Now, this bitter old man has also added a lonely winter, singing Meng Jiangnu's song in a false voice. I want to push open the window and ask him if he has met the little girl who gave him two dimes? However, in this cold wind and rain, can you bear to listen to the hoarse erhu and the song "The first month is the New Year"?</p>
<p>Leaning my head on the back of the rattan chair, I lit a cigarette. The blazing stove and bitter Longjing have been occupied by me, in your lonely life it is enough to be proudly in front of that bitter old man, he is living through twice as lonely years as you!</p>
<p>I smiled victoriously again!</p>

<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>The boat entered the inner river, it was dusk: a very thick fog had risen, and ships could not be seen five feet away. The boatman was cautious, saying that they could have arrived before the lanterns were lit, but now that such a thick fog had risen outside, they couldn't see anyone across from them, so who would dare to be so bold as to sail out and collide with other boats? He said it was a matter of everyone's lives, and they might as well rest for the night and leave at daybreak.</p>
<p>And so, we all had to spend the night on the boat.</p>
<p>Listening to the echoing shouts, the boatman secured the ropes firmly; then he gathered firewood to make a fire and cook dinner. It was completely dark, and the river surface was shrouded in a layer of thick fog. Lanterns were scattered sparsely everywhere, like torches behind a beaded curtain, hazy and charming. Usually, boats gathered in groups of three or five. We could hear the boatmen chatting and sighing across the boats, and the noise of chickens, dogs, and children. From the shore came the sounds of people, the sounds of hawking, and the sounds of vehicles and horses. Through the thick fog, we could still vaguely see the outlines of houses and softened lamplight. The world was deathly still, and the vast river surface was also deathly still, but across the dividing line, it nurtured a kind of melancholy, a kind of despondency, a kind of aloofness and loneliness.</p>
<p>A breeze stirred on the river, slowly. The old boatman brought the steaming hot rice into the cabin, with a cautious, reverent expression, let the guests eat their fill, and then went to the bow of the boat with his companions and children to eat.</p>
<p>The night wind made people shiver, and the night was also quite boring. The passengers in the cabin asked the boatmen to clear away the remains of dinner, and some, wearing their old spectacles, took out a small, folded "Illustrated Seven Beauties Picture" from their pockets to read and sing along. Some took out playing cards and chess pieces to gamble with each other. Some peeled off a piece of old newspaper from their luggage and read it over and over. Some, out of boredom, occasionally met each other's eyes, nodded, and began to talk about ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>They began to talk, but it was all unpleasant narratives: talking about years of famine, talking about the stories of women in small villages who hanged themselves because they ran out of food, talking about the absurd tragedies of strong men being murdered in batches, talking about the increasingly difficult business, talking about this "generation being worse than the last" world...</p>
<p>A middle-aged cloth merchant, with countless lines carved on his sallow face, his eyes dulled by two or three nights of insomnia, could not even maintain the balance of his pronunciation as he reminisced about a scene of life's hardships, his lips trembling like the wings of an autumn cicada.</p>
<p>"These years are truly unlike any I've lived through: even large grains of wheat planted in the fields can't keep people alive, so people have to drift far away from their hometowns, drifting away, not knowing whether they'll live or die; but in the end, they face even greater hardships. Doing business, working, opening workshops, nothing works. People are making too many tricks, and in the end, they're always taking people's lives."</p>
<p>A light of torment flashed in his eyes: "The market is so bad, old fellow, think about it, what way is there to go these days!! I'm already over fifty, and I still don't know if I'll live or die tomorrow. Oh, look, the weather has changed."</p>
<p>His voice, withered and faint like a dying oil lamp, filled the listeners' hearts with dampness, as if they had swallowed a mouthful of cold water. Some people's enthusiasm gradually withered away, and everyone was silent, as if pondering something.</p>
<p>Lightly and sparsely, in the fog, rain began to fall outside, and the wind blowing in through the window cracks was uncomfortably cold. The boatman called out softly from outside: "Esteemed guests, please rest early. The fog will clear tonight and we'll set sail. We'll be there before dawn tomorrow."</p>
<p>Everyone silently went to their bunks, thinking, "If only the fog would clear sooner."</p>

<p>The Danguang Drama Society performed a one-act play "Lying on Firewood and Tasting Gall" at the temporary theater of Danguang University. In everyone's imagination, performing a play in a university should be orderly. Heh, it was simply an inverse proportion, the guests in front of the stage were arguing and causing chaos, and the actors in front of the stage were throwing tantrums. At this time, the director, Mr. Wang Yang, was busy appeasing both sides, and finally managed to get through the play.</p>

<h3 id="e301">Margaret Sullavan's "Runaway Marriage" <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Carefully Planned Secrets Are Difficult to Keep</p>
<p>Leaving the Screen to Be a Full-Time Wife</p>
<p>Margaret Sullavan and her director William Wyler's "runaway marriage" was originally carefully planned and foolproof. But the result was beyond their expectations. They thought that no one would know before the announcement, and they decided that the day of their marriage announcement would be when they finished their new film "The Good Fairy" and went out for their honeymoon hand in hand. This was their plan. Unexpectedly, a small glitch occurred. When their secret was leaked out, Hollywood didn't believe it. That day was Sunday night, and some people sitting next to the radio only heard Wingell announce a very simple piece of news, saying that Margaret Sullavan and her director William Wyler had married this morning at 11 o'clock in Yuma. Even if the newlyweds Margaret and William heard this simple piece of news, they would be surprised and disbelieving, because they believed that their secret was impossible to leak. Besides the new couple, there were two other people involved in the secret, William Wyler's lawyer and one of Margaret Sullavan's close friends, but they would never reveal this secret. So how did the outside world know? This shows that in the United States, where the news industry is developed, it is not easy to keep anything secret. According to their plan, they would slip away hand in hand after finishing work on Saturday night and return to work as usual on Monday, so that no one would know. They filmed on Saturday night until 4 am on Sunday before finishing. At 6 am, Margaret, William, and William's lawyer boarded the pre-rented 15-seater plane and set off for Yuma. Besides the three of them, there was also a pilot and no one else. Setting out at dawn with the dew, the sunrise in the clouds, the celestial couple, proudly roaming the sky, their joy is naturally self-evident. Everything went smoothly in Yuma. The pastor was also arranged in advance. After the new couple kissed after the ceremony, they returned to the airfield hand in hand. When Margaret was about to jump back into the plane, there was another young lady at the airfield waiting for another plane to land. She recognized that the person jumping into the plane and the two men who were leaving in a hurry was a certain Hollywood star. She casually said a word to the airfield staff, and then the news spread! When they were riding the wind and feeling like immortals, the telegraph lines and wireless machines were busy ringing. The romance between Margaret Sullavan and William Wyler was extremely swift and silent, and did not attract anyone's attention beforehand. On the surface, they were very incompatible. Although Margaret admired William Wyler's directing talent very much, in the year and a half they knew each other, she never expected to marry Wyler. They often argued about this and that on the set. Margaret's personality is very strong. She says whatever she thinks with her straightforward temperament. She doesn't like working at night. She gave Wyler a nickname called Owl because he liked working at night. She also complained that Wyler worked too slowly, saying that he would never finish a film. At the same time, she was in close contact with Corinne Murray's ex-husband, John McCormick. She never talked to her director for more than three sentences on the set. She got along very well with the general staff and had a lot of fun. But recently, Margaret often ate lunch at the same table with her director in the dining room. The director would talk incessantly, and Margaret would sit silently and listen. However, people always thought they were talking about things in the film and would never think that love would happen between them. But Margaret's personality suddenly changed. She no longer resisted filming at night and often filmed happily from dusk until dawn. This was something that even she herself found hard to believe. This went on for almost two weeks. Suddenly one day, she discovered that she had fallen in love with her director, deeply in love. The rest is self-explanatory. But Margaret is a person who goes forward without looking back. She wants to have children as soon as she gets married. Therefore, it is expected that she will leave the film industry and become a full-time wife.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e302">Review of "Behold My Wife" <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Behold My Wife丨Cathay</p>
<p>Since "Madame Butterfly", Sylvia Sidney, who has a distinct Eastern woman flavor, has been warmly noticed by Chinese audiences, so her "Behold My Wife" has once again caused a sensation among Shanghai audiences in the New Year. In addition to "Madame Butterfly", she also played very well in "Street Scene". However, she has not had any other successful performances. As for this film, her acting skills are not particularly outstanding, at best, she is only dutiful, because the story does not suit her personality.</p>
<p>In this film, only the process of Manley's suicide is very well written. Regardless of the arrangement of the atmosphere or the handling of the scene, and due to Ann Sheridan's excellent acting skills (although there are not many scenes), that scene is indeed very emotional, becoming the most outstanding and wonderful part of the work. If this film is valuable, then it is only expressed here.</p>
<p>From the time the young master angrily left home, from the door of the house to the door of the car, quickly writing several doors in a row, and then using cars and alcohol to describe his wandering and the psychological perversion of his suicidal body, also shows the director's cleverness. From the beginning until the young master meets Sylvia Sidney in the hotel, "Behold My Wife" tightly grasps the audience's mood and pays attention to future developments. But the fact is not like this, from then on, the progress of the play is very mediocre. The twists and turns of the plot are stiff and artificial, and it can be said that there is simply no drama, but only the narration of the story. Even in the highest conflict, when Sylvia Sidney realizes that the young master's husband does not sincerely love her, but only uses her as a tool to anger his family, (the young master does not want her to take off her Indian costume,) that scene is also so weak, and Sylvia Sidney's performance is also so unfamiliar. All the way until Sylvia Sidney goes to jail for someone else's crime, and the young master's husband conscientiously takes the blame for his wife, it is even more unreasonable to make up a story for the sake of the story. The degree of childishness and absurdity is beyond compare.</p>
<p>In terms of technique, we see that the director's depiction of the personality of the characters in the play is quite commendable in some scenes. For example, writing about the young master's stubborn mother, his father's mediocrity, his sister's treachery, and Sylvia Sidney's Indian's strong and chaste national character, what is expressed is the mother's anxiety, needing alcohol to stimulate, the father's busyness, the sister's cold words and false smiles, and Sylvia Sidney's bold removal of bullets for the young master and her rampage at the train station are all better depictions. But they are not consistently portrayed, and the more the play progresses, the more they lose their original personality. This, like the inability to consistently grasp the atmosphere, shows that the director and playwright do not have the ability to create in depth.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is not a successful work. Although it has its individual successes, on the whole, with the problem of being heavy at the beginning and light at the end, the impression it gives people is very fragile.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Review of "Moonlight and Flowers" <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>Flirtation Walk 丨丨 Great Light Cinema</p>
<p>Judging from Frank Borzage's consistent style, Dick, the soldier in "Moonlight and Flowers," strives for upward mobility, being ashamed of his low status, and seeking advanced studies at a military academy. He eventually rises from a lower-ranking soldier to become a top student in the military academy. This spirit of striving upward has been hinted at in Borzage's earlier works. However, the story of "Moonlight and Flowers" is vulgar.</p>
<p>An officer's daughter falls in love with a lower-ranking soldier, motivating the lower-ranking soldier to strive and climb upward, and then marry the officer's daughter. This vulgar concept almost makes us not believe it is a work by Borzage. In earlier works such as "Seventh Heaven" and "Angel," the characters that appeared were resentful due to poverty, and as a result, they found comfort in love and purity. This style continued until the recent "A Farewell to Arms," which is still a depiction of impoverished life, where the male and female protagonists shed tears of joy amid the cruel living environment for the sake of the purity of love. Of course, the author cannot essentially excavate the sadness of life, and often uses love to dissolve the troubles of life, but the cruel depiction of life's worries makes people cry bitterly. However, "Moonlight and Flowers," as a musical film, does not inherit the previous style. The discovery of purity here is due to the officer's daughter falling in love with the soldier's handsomeness, and then waiting for the lower-ranking soldier to rise in rank before breaking off her engagement with the officer and marrying the soldier. This expression of purity is truly too vulgar. Can we still see a bit of the sadness of life? The so-called concept of love transcending everything shows that Borzage is gradually becoming mediocre.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, the story structure here is also extremely imprecise. For example, Dick's friend is transferred to Shanghai, and other than receiving a few letters from Dick, he does almost nothing. Later, when they meet, it is just a very unimportant scene. This character seems superfluous in the play, and therefore interrupts the development of the main storyline several times. Also, it is very sudden that the officer's daughter's fiancé shakes hands with Dick, allowing his fiancée to marry Dick. There should at least be a scene of the engaged couple breaking up.</p>
<p>However, some scenes are indeed very good. The most important is the so-called Flirtation Walk, with its bright moonlight, crisp singing, charming dance, and gentle flirtation. Due to the excellent photography, appropriate camera angles, composition of the shots, and the atmosphere at the time, everything is very beautiful. In addition, the several military drills are also extremely beautiful. The military music, like the aforementioned scenes, is also fascinating. From these aspects, it still fully illustrates the excellence of Borzage's technique. The expression methods of a famous director are, after all, extraordinary.</p>
<p>Like other recent American films, this is full of vigor, brisk, uplifting, and humorous, forming a lovely tragicomedy. It makes people feel light and harmonious, but because of this, it has lost Borzage's consistent rigorous content, and the calm tone and serious atmosphere are absent here. As a musical film, this is quite original and unique, at least preserving a simple atmosphere, not as strongly imbued with the scent of gold as "The Springtime of Life" and "Gold Diggers of 1935". However, as mentioned above, due to the determination of the content, this work ultimately only belongs to the category of ordinary and vulgar.</p>

<p>— Hua Shu</p>
<p>The most fashionable leisure activities for Chinese stars are dancing, watching plays, eating fancy dishes, and swimming in the summer. But let's see what these foreign stars do in their spare time.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo often wears black glasses and strolls down the street, looking at the merchandise in the shop windows. Sometimes she sneaks into a small café alone, sits in a corner, and drinks a cup of coffee. When someone notices her, she quickly runs away.</p>
<p>Bette Davis often gazes out of the window on high rooftops, or spends very little money to eat something at small snack shops.</p>
<p>Johnny Weissmuller loves to swim. Regardless of the weather, he always spends his life in the pool.</p>
<p>When Shirley Temple visits the park, she only brings a dog, and sits silently among the deep branches, watching others. She can see people, but people cannot see her, even in very cold and snowy weather.</p>
<p>Ann Harding likes to go to the countryside and the fields. Sometimes she lingers in the California countryside, and the company searches for her everywhere because of the filming schedule. In the end, they find her in a remote area.</p>
<p>Robert Montgomery spends half of his free time at home reading newspapers and magazines, and the other half at sports fields, theaters, coffee shops, or restaurants. Sometimes, when he's in a good mood, he goes to five or six restaurants a day, which is also common.</p>
<p>Whenever Marlene Dietrich has free time, she likes to chat and play with a few friends, or ride a bicycle. In the winter, she hopes for snow because she likes to ice skate in the snow.</p>

<p>— Liu Cun</p>
<p>This shattered his heart, and he couldn't care less about what happened to himself. His heart and his brain were momentarily numb. When Mr. Murdstone told him that he was going to send him to London to be an apprentice in the wine shop opened by Murdstone and Grinby, he could only speak one word at a time, and his language was incoherent. So he soon went to London to be an apprentice in Murdstone and Grinby's wine shop, where he could have a bowl of rice to eat, some pocket money, and a place to sleep.</p>
<p>In the wine shop, he leaned his small back against the huge wooden barrels every day, washing bottles all day long. A group of older children, making fun of his gentlemanly demeanor, mocked him at all times, and there was no joy to speak of. The only joy he got in London was interacting with the family of his landlord, Mr. Micawber. He soon developed a sincere affection for Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. He was also very friendly with their four noisy children and their not very useful servant, Creakle, who was a child taken from the Lowood Orphan Asylum.</p>
<p>Mr. Micawber's family was something he had never expected in his life. Mr. Micawber was also someone he had never seen before. Before seeing him, you had to see one of his long legs first, because he often climbed into the house through the skylight to avoid being seen by the noisy creditors outside the door demanding payment. But as soon as he saw David, he happily met him and extended a thick, fat hand to shake his. He turned his head and looked at Mrs. Micawber, cheerfully telling her that he had "severed ties" with the grocery store because they had cut off the commission he had hoped for.</p>
<p>Mrs. Micawber, hearing this, said mournfully, "But what about my dear Wilkins' future? If I say we still have to talk about it, would you say I'm wrong?" Mr. Micawber then said, "My dear, remember the words 'After the worst, comes the best.' I have thoroughly planned all kinds of businesses. I have chosen the wine-making industry. Simply put, I have written several letters to important winemakers in various places, stating my qualifications and wanting to serve them. All the details have not yet been determined, but I firmly believe that some opportunities will be discovered in this."</p>
<p>Outside the door, a group of creditors clamored for Mr. Micawber to repay his debts, otherwise, they would eat his flesh. Inside the door, a group of children shouted strangely, fighting each other. Creakle took an oil drum and fed them things to eat. But Mr. Micawber was a perpetually optimistic man, looking at his little tenant, David, with a rather content and happy expression. He quietly waited for any opportunity to be discovered. David lived with them for a few months and was also very happy. They made him forget his own sorrowful fate and arduous work. But he was not blessed by heaven, and even Mr. Micawber's family was taken away. One day at noon, Creakle brought him bad news. That night, he found Mr. Micawber's entire family imprisoned for failing to repay their debts.</p>
<p>But if David thought they must be sad and weeping, he was wrong, because when David went to the prison to see them, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber were toasting with a large bowl of grog. Celebrating? That's right, because not long after they were imprisoned, Mrs. Micawber's family bravely came to their rescue, paying off all their debts and promising to find Mr. Micawber two positions at the Customs House of Gravesend. Therefore, Mr. Micawber felt leisurely and happy, and good fortune would soon descend. Mr. Micawber was certainly very happy, but their relocation caused David to lose the few good companions he had in London. After waving his hand and sending them away, his heart was full of sorrow, and he realized the bitterness of his abandonment and isolation, with no relatives to turn to. (To be continued)</p>
