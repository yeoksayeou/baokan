<p>（天津）二十七午前十時一刻、駐津日軍四十餘名、乘裝甲汽車一部、載重軍用貨加車擬十二時五分開行、貨物均未得裝竣、日本並在站長室及車站監視、調查兩列車號碼、且有人入西貨廠檢視存廠客貨車輛數、同時北寗路局亦接豐台站長電話、報告該站亦發生同樣事、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）今晨五時五十分、北寗路七次車由平開出時、平日軍一部、約六十餘人、搭車同行、過豐台時、即全部下車、在站北天興棧鄰近覓妥民房六間為住所、似有久居意、並有日軍用汽車六輛、由平開到豐台、載有小鋼砲兩門、及軍用品甚多、大興縣政府公安局於日軍到豐台後、曾派員往問真相、但日軍未予答復、地方情形安謐如恒、絕無異態、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）豐台站長報津、二十七早、日軍六十餘名、由平乘北髯路車開抵豐台、該兵全體武裝、攜有鋼砲一門、到豐台後、即布步哨於東站、及平漢北寗路過軌處、架軍用電話、與平津日軍隊部聯絡、一部軍隊覓住車站旁天興客棧、一部則佔用民房、旋由其軍官帶兵至車站監視站長、同時通知平漢站長、不得擅發路簽、放行南下車輛、時北寗平漢兩路聯運貨車、正擬由該站過軌、轉平漢南下、卽由日軍阻止、平漢路北來車則放行無阻、豐台車車站所存兩路車輛、均經日兵調查、筆其車號於簿、其他各次平津往來車、及其平綏通車放行無阻、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）榆關日軍百五十餘名、二十六日抵平後、即分駐日兵營及東單三條大和俱樂部、該部日軍九十餘名、全副武裝、並攜帶軍用品頗多、復於二十七日晨五時四十五分、開至豐台、下車後、即把守車站、檢查來往列車、阻止平漢浦聯運、駐站二十九軍一連、因恐發生衝突、已暫退站外、（二十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（天津）北寗路局二十七日電鐵部、及在京之殷同、報告日軍扣車經過、並請示辦法、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）北寗路局、二十七日通飭沿綫各站及新河材料廠、唐山大同榆關橋樑廠人員、安心工作、並防止奸人破壞路政、（二十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（北平）平津衛戍部總參議陳覺生談、此次豐台日軍、要求北寗平漢兩路停止車皮過軌事、純係誤會、日軍近鑒北寗路車皮大量過軌南下、致引起不滿、此種枝節問題當可迎刃而解、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>雙方決定三項辦法</p>
<p>（天津）二十七日晨十時許、津日駐屯軍部派鐵甲車一輛、載重車三輛、分載武裝兵士三十餘名、到總站時、津浦二十一次南下快車已出站、七十五次赴濟南客貨車正準備開出、日兵即上前攔阻該次車出動、一面由一軍官率兵入津浦站長室、聲稱南下車不能開走、是時二十一次快車已駛抵西站、遂又遭該站日兵截阻、旋津浦路駐津辦事處聞訊、即由主任高恒儒、協同北寗路副局長陸夢熊等、訪晤多田司令、詢以究竟、旋經雙方口頭決定、（一）不得放空車皮南下、（二）不得載運軍隊、（三）南下一列車、須同時有一列車北上、至是遂告解決、復由日軍部派員到兩站通告、日軍返營、計二十一次車誤三小時、七十五次車誤四十分鐘、又據交通界息、平漢聯運車在豐臺、於二十七日晨同時被阻、聞亦同樣解決、（二十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（北平）秦德純為日兵開豐台廣安門車站佈崗事、今向日使館交涉、高橋謂係恐各路空車皮南開集中、故往監視、二三日內即可撒退、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）日軍扣車事發生後、北寗路局副局長陸夢熊、車務處長鮑錫藩、參議李鐵珊、偕津浦路局駐津辦事處長高恆、即赴日駐屯軍部訪其司令多田、至午談判終了、暫告解決、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）二十七午、津日軍部派尾由中尉到津浦車站、將陸高與多田會談結果、傳達於該站長、旋引兵回海光寺、二十一次津浦客車至十二時一刻、第七十五次貨加車至十二時四十分、始先後開出豐台、北寗平漢聯運車、經津日軍部以電話通知其軍隊放行、於午後一時許始南開、停津總站、津浦第四零五次貨車、原亦被監視、迄下午始行開出、（二十七日專電）</p>
<p>津浦南下車止濟南</p>
<p>（天津）津浦路所有南下車輛、因日軍當局之要求、現均止於濟南、最初日軍擬使津浦路全綫運輸完全停止、後允折衷辦理、今晨有日兵一隊、赴此間津浦車站要求停駛、但中國當局拒絕、後經磋商、日方始允車輛開行、但以南行車輛不得越過濟南為條件、此舉直使北上車輛皆被扣於華北也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）據華人方面可恃消息、今晨五時由此出發之日兵九十人、已接收豐台車站、聞日兵到站後、即擬阻止交通、但為路員所勸阻、仍許火車照常往來日兵、徵發平漢路所有之客車與貨車若干輛、並接收中國軍用電話綫、按豐台在北平南十二哩、在平津路綫上、與殷汝耕冀東「自治國」疆界相去不遠、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）日兵佔據豐臺車站後、復佔據章儀門車站、該車站在北平西南門外約三百碼、位於一支綫之上、聯接通至天津與通至張家口之路綫、故日兵既佔此二車站、遂得控制華北所有之鐵路、平津間之火車今照常開駛、漢口通車亦仍駛行、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）日軍發言人謂、日軍之佔據豐台及收用軍用電話綫、為保護交通及防止北平車輛南遷起見云、取消日方頃所發日軍僅從事操演之半官式說明、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（北平）日兵佔據豐台車站、據日方半官解釋、謂唐山日軍與北平日大使署之衛兵、現正舉行操演、故作攻佔豐台車站並奪取火車與電話綫之試驗、蓋如發生真正戰事、日軍必作此舉也、俟操演完畢、日兵交還該車站、按日軍近數年來、每遇中國政局緊張時、輒在此間中國界內舉行操演、固已司空見慣、但此次佔據豐台車站火車電話綫、殊使華人大為驚惶、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>百五十年前。美國第一艘輪船自舊金山航抵廣州。於是太平洋航務日繁。東西商旅之往返。文化之溝通。呈一日千里之勢。最近太平洋航空又已正式開辦。美國與遠東之交通。至速本須三四星期始達者。今竟減至五六日。是誠不啻古人所謂縮地術矣。</p>
<p>聯美航空公司籌備太平洋定期航空。已有數年之久。先後造成四發動機之巨型飛船三艘。本月二十三日自舊金山出發擔任首次太平洋航空之『中國號。』為美國首屈一指之大飛機。其姊妹機『菲律賓號』亦將加入航空綫。最初造成之一艘。則為『東方號。』自本年三月間起。即作試飛。在舊金山至太平洋中心之半程島間。共作周密之往返測騐四次。『中國號』現正在太平洋上空飛航。一途平穩。預計明日可達馬尼刺終站矣。</p>
<p>聯美航空公司計畫中之太平洋航空。原有三大幹綫。均以舊金山為總站。今次所開辦者為其第一綫。原擬以我國之廣州為終站。因受某方牽掣而未果。旋復擬於香港或澳門任擇其一。談判亦尚未臻妥洽。最後決定以馬尼刺為終站。全綫計長八千公里。美政府郵傳部於六月間核准開辦後。菲律賓政府亦即於十月間。特許該公司營業二十年。第二綫以新西蘭之沃克蘭為終站。現已與新西蘭當局訂立契約。於明年七月間開辦。本綫自舊金山至檀香山一段。與第一綫同。惟到檀島後即折而向南。經金門灘及巴谷巴谷島而至沃克蘭。全綫計長六千五百公里。約三天可達。第三棧則以澳洲之墨爾缽或達爾溫為終點。現以英國航空公司所辦之定期航空綫。已自倫敦通至澳洲之錫宜。二綫啣接辦法。尚未商定。何時開辦。亦無眉目。</p>
<p>遼闊之太平洋。今首次開辦定期航空。其意義為何如乎。就商業性質而論。航空公司方面之收入。即目前郵運一項。每程約達美金一萬六千元之譜。不可謂非有利之新事業。至於軍事方面。亦不無作用可言。美國近年來擴充空軍。不遺餘力。去年底美海軍部之常年報告。列舉巴拿馬至美國與美國本部至夏威夷及阿拉斯加之編隊飛行成績。以為美國之空軍實力堪稱世界無敵。本年三月間。美海軍部長史璜生於准許航空公司在關島威克島。及半程島開闢飛行場時。保留緊急時佔用各該機場之權利。八月間。羅斯福總統復批准韋爾柯克斯航空案。即在東西海岸。增關陸軍航空根據地六處。以防衛巴拿馬運河及阿拉斯加。並劃阿留申群島一帶洋面。為海軍航空根據地。是則美國顯欲藉飛機以佐軍艦。從事於控制太平洋之布置。太平洋航空之開辦。其旁證也。</p>

<p>國聯今夜宣布德國所頒禁止軍用品運濟交戰國之法令、鐵鎳錫等皆在禁列、德國曾以該怯令送致國聯會員國、日內瓦一般人士之意、德國此舉大有助於集體安全制及國聯會員國實施對意制裁之努力、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>又據可靠消息、意國駐英大使德魯蒙、於今晨通知英國外交部、謂東菲洲意軍參謀部為軍事形勢所迫、不得不向阿國西部查那湖方面進攻、龔達區域當可於下星期攻下、按阿國西部關係英國利益較為密切、故墨索里尼急欲與倫敦談判、藉以商討如何保障英國利益云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國參衆兩院休假期滿、於明日重行開會、依照向例國會復會前、當由國務總理發表演說、陳述政府見地、因此賴伐爾總理特於今晚發表無綫電廣播演說、就內政方面、如財政問題·法郞問題·及法西斯團體問題、就外交方面如意阿問題·及集體安全問題、均有所陳述、爲詞甚長、茲節錄如下、</p>
<p>賴伐爾首述法郞問題、謂星期四日國會復會時、首先當决定者、厥爲法郞之運命、「應如何維持經濟平衡、避免貶低幣價、此實爲當務之急、如國會反對此種見解、則應明白加以說明、則以國民固有要求明瞭局勢之權利也、不然、國會人士如聚訟紛紜、爭呶無已、則勢必將造成徬徨不定之局面、而使財政受其致命傷、故爲今之計、應請國會對于財政問題迅卽投票决定、萬勿遲延、否則後患誠不堪設想矣、」</p>
<p>其次辯明政府代法律命令之正當、謂政府始終反對貶低幣價、蓋貶低幣價、實使小康寒素之家直接加重負担、其危險殊甚、而于國會總選舉將屆之今日、行之尤爲不當、故政府决計堅决加以拒絕云、賴伐爾繼謂財政問題解决以後、國會不妨討論所謂法西斯團體之問題、政府對於此層亦有所準備、「蓋保證公民安全、保障共和制度、爲政府應有之責、無論何黨何派、若欲太阿倒持、以黨派權威代替國家權威、則依法均所不許、遠之如勃萊斯德港與都龍港之事件、近之如里摩奇城火十字團與人民陣綫衝突、凡此均屬弁髦法令、如此後再行發生、則政府將使參加此種事伴之團體、喪失其應享自由、其各凜之、現行法令倘有未足、則政府當加以補充、無論如何、政府必令人人奉公守法而後已、諸君咸知余素愛和平、故尤希望和平應先從國內做起、暴方不問其來自何方、均爲余所反對、余今敢奉吿國人、其勿無事自擾、致爲仇者所快、抑本年十一月十一日左右兩派人士分別在無名英雄墓前示威、同屬國人而自相對壘、此非亂萌而何、以吾偉大之國民而不知懸崖勒馬、其誰信之、要之全國國民和衷共濟、實救國之惟一要道焉、</p>
<p>賴我爾繼述意阿問題、謂「國際公約爲吾國安全之一主要因素、故公約所產生之結果、吾人自負有履行之義務、吾人一方面謀與英國常期合作、另一方面亦無時無刻不欲設法以使爭端之地方化、吾人已竭盡一切、以避免衝突範圍之擴大、自意阿衝突發端時起、吾人始終贊成避免武力制裁、各項措置凡足以引起海軍封鎖及閉鎖蘇彝士運河者、從未考慮及之、余所担當之任務殊爲艱難、蓋一方面須始終保持與英國之友誼合作、表示法國信守國聯會盟約、而另一方面則尤必須保持對意國之友誼、余所以不避艱困、周旋兩者之間、無非欲使吾國本身利益與和平、二者得以雙方兼顧而巳、余以堅忍不拔之毅力、爲意阿衝突尋覓友好解决之途徑、此種企圖斷無可以指摘之處、則以制裁本非停止戰爭之唯一方策也、英法兩國之合作、當力求其密切誠信、以今視昔猶有甚焉、蓋英法兩國所共同企求者、無非和平而巳、爲保全和平計、英法兩國同心同德、固無絲毫芥蒂於其間、吾人所望者、一旦時機來臨、意相墨索里尼幡然變計、使吾人調解意阿爭端之種種努力、不至盡擲虛牝、則誠萬幸矣、抑意阿爭端必須尋覓榮譽公正之解决方式、一方面應尊重國聯會之原則、他方面亦應顧及意大利之利益、余信全世界負責之士當屬人同此心、心同此理、余知意國政府領袖必深願使意國重行參加歐洲和平組織、苟然則斯德里薩會議所開始之工作、彼時固未始不可賡續進行矣、」最後賴伐爾乃述及體安全問題、略謂「法國始終信守集體安全之原則、於無論」卽就法蘇互助公約而論、亦决無反對任何國家之意、此層最近法國駐德大使龐賽會為德國元首希特勒喋喋言之、總之、吾人不背棄任何友誼、吾人當尊重一切約束、吾人力謀各國協力、以共同鞏固歐洲之和平、至對于德國、吾人尤誠意祝望建立并發展相互尊敬之善鄰關係、蓋法國既為強大活潑愛好和平之國家、則固無所畏懼也」、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）左翼各黨今日集會時、對於明日眾院開會之辯論、未能告成妥協、已使賴伐爾應付政治風潮有勝利之希望、故證券交易所人氣轉堅、在半小時內公債之價漲高一磅音之四分之三、佛郎盤之價亦較堅、左翼各黨將於明日繼集會、以圖獲一共同立塲、推倒政府、急進黨主張依賴伐爾之請求、明日衆院開會時、先討論佛郞問題、政府如能先在財政辯論中獲得勝利、則隨後應付法西斯事案、卽可較有把握、今日左翼各黨議時、有人問社會黨領袖白倫氏、如政明日竟被推倒、則渠將作何行動、白倫稱、渠將於兩小時內組成誓必解散法西斯黨各會社之政府云（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）急進社會黨衆議院黨團頃通過決議案、採納賴伐爾總理之主張、於衆復會時、應先行討論政府財政政策、然卽行繼續討論法西斯團體之問題、此决議案倘得衆院大多數通過、則政潮可暫時緩和、但衆院有急進黨議員一百六十人、而上項黨團决議案、則僅以二十八票對二十票之多數通過、此則極可注意也、又今晨國務會議開會時、各閣員堅决表示政府當竭力設法遏止法西斯團體之不正當活動、此舉在表面上頗足使政局緊張性爲之緩和云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國國會將於星期四開會、此次會議火槪將爲第三民主國歷史上最重要之一幕、其當前之問題、不獨爲賴伐爾內閣之存亡所寄、卽法國民主政體之本身亦大有關係、衆院左右兩翼對於內政外交各種重要問題、意見較前益相懸殊、內政方面最大之爭點約有三端、（一）解散右派之法西斯組織、如火十字團·法國共進團及愛國團等、此舉不但為社會共產人民前鋒所迫切要求、亦爲國會中最有勢力之急性社會黨所堅决主張、（二）賴言內閣之財政及經濟政策、賴氏將政人員之薪水·退伍軍人等之恩給·以及項行政費用·竭力减削、雖已達到預算平衡之目的、然是否應當繼續亦成問題、（三）來年五月改選國會之控制問題、至於外交方面、則目前法國之地位雖非常複雜、其對於全世界之關係亦非常重要、然觀察者以爲此猶不過爲次要問題而已、國會中左右兩派之形勢、左派似將結合、以不管部閣員急進黨領袖赫里歐或更爲左傾之前總理獨立派彭古爲領袖、而以法西斯組織問題或財政問題爲推翻賴伐爾之武器、社會黨今日已議决與其他左派組織聯絡、推翻現內閣故形勢已益形嚴重、結果法國政界上或將異軍突起、取得政權、例如火十字團號稱有團員三十萬人、據左派聲稱、該團已受策動政變之訓話、現在政府方面最大之難關、卽爲政府之公務人員、因彼等組織嚴密、已久有「國中之國」之稱、在政見上頗與左翼接近、故將來左派攻擊政府之時、彼等之勢力亦未可侮、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法蘭西銀行高級職員今日吿美聯社記者、稱現無驚慌之理由、法郎亦無變價之危險、更無發生金融風潮之可能云、但據該行之報告、十一月前二十四日內流出之黃金約達四、五〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇法郎之巨、（廿六日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c69">具象美 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>聽人說話，聽到具象的，瑣屑的，淺顯的語句，往往覺得比抽象的，正大的，深刻的句語來得動聽。先舉一個最顯著的例譬如說「生活問題」不如說「衣食問題」來得動聽；說「衣食問題」又不如說「飯碗問題」或「麵包問題」來得動聽。因爲「生活」二字固然包括得很周全，但是太抽象，太正大，太深刻了，故聽者由此所得的理解欠深，印象欠强，興味欠濃。倘換了「衣食」三字，因爲較具體，較瑣屑，較淺顯，聽了就覺得容易理解，印象强明，而且富有興味，可以把握，有時說話的人還嫌「衣食」二字所指太廣泛，就更進一步而用「飯碗」或「類包」二字。這是人人最常見最稔熟的一伴實物，聽到了誰不立刻獲得切身的興味，强明的印象，與充分的理解呢？故「失業」常被翻譯作「敲破飯碗」；「失地」也被翻譯作「地圖改色」　使聽者觸目驚心。</p>
<p>我現在就稱這種說話的技術爲「具象美」。這也是人類言語進步後的修辭法之一種，與以前我所談的「比喩」（其文載今年某號文學雜誌上）同類，但自有差別：比喩也是取具象的東西來帮助說理的；但所取的具象物，其本身與說理並無關係，只是性狀相同而巳。譬如說「割雞焉用牛刀」？此事與孔子的治道毫無關係，只是「大材小用」這一點性狀相同，故引用爲譬喩，使說理具象化，又趣味化，而易於動聽耳。現在所談的「具象美」則不然：其所取具象物，必與說理有密切關係，能使聽者于小中見大，個中見全。譬如「飯碗」或「麵包」，與「生活」有密切關係，而且是「生活」的最重要部分，或核心。故言者只須舉此　一隅，聽者便可反三，反十，反百，反千。蓋所謂「飯碗」者，其實連老酒，香烟，自來火等一切食用皆包括在內。我覺得這種語言的技術，最有意味，尤其是聽講演，讀論文的時候，滔滔洋洋的一篇抽象的大道理，往往容易使人頭痛或打瞌睡。反之，倘善用比喩及這種具象美，聽者就不會感到疲倦；善用之極，寥寥數藷可抵洋洋數萬言之力。淳于髠，東方朔等諷諫者的說話，詩人的說話，可說是其實例。</p>
<p>這種具象美的實例，在我們的日常語言中，在詩文中，皆不勝枚舉。爲便於吟味，就我所能想起的摘錄幾個在下面，也不過舉一隅而已。</p>
<p>投筆，請纓，解甲，下車，下野，卽位，彈冠，束髮，洗耳，拭目，賦閑，悼亡，披鬄，糊口，掃榻，執牛耳，奪錦標，執敎鞭，步後塵，高枕而臥，逍遙林下，拜倒裙下，爭奉笻屣，……</p>
<p>照字面上看，這些話大都講不通。文人的筆難道晝夜在手？武人的甲難道晝夜不解？棄官的常住租界，何嘗下野？那一個首領的手裏執着一隻牛耳朶呢？然而這便是具象美的興味所在。其中也有靠古典的帮助的，或近於比喩的。但總以小中見大，個中見全爲原則。俗語中也頗富於關於此的好例。善於說話的人的口中，常常在那裏吐露出來，他們不說「某家沒飯吃了」，偏說「某家的鍋子底向天了」。不說「某人可以留名後世」，偏說「某人得吃冷羹飯了」。廚川白村說婦女問題是「胃袋與子宮」的問題。」吳稚暉說戀愛是「精蟲作怪」。語雖苛刻，然而動聽。可謂盡言語的具象化的能事。可惜我的見聞太狹，記憶太壞，一時想不起更多的實例來。（未完）</p>

<p>各廠之火柴銷路</p>
<p>我國曩昔所用火柴、均係船來品、前巳言之、其在華銷額、就瑞典火柴而言、自民國十年後、每年由十萬兩而二十萬、更由二十萬而四十萬而六十萬、至民國十九年、復增至一百零一萬兩、考其增加原因、約有二端、（一）因外商籍不平等條約爲護符、外貨進口、豁免關卡捐稅、故各處傾銷、毫無顧忌、（二）因外商引用最惠國條約、在華設廠製造、運輸水脚旣省、工價復能低廉、故成本减輕、低價競售、民國二十年、雖政府增加火柴進口稅率、對於火柴進口、似有限制、惟在華製造者日多、仍無法加以統制、原有勢力、未嘗稍戢、實爲上海火柴業之勁敵、是故叙述上海各廠火柴之銷路、不得不先述上海各廠火柴之市塲、與夫外貨競爭之情形、其他銷數·納稅·市價、尤其次焉者也、</p>
<p>一·　市場　吾國火柴市場、極為複雜、有國產火柴、舶來火柴、及外商在華製造之火柴、運銷區域、約分五區、計有蘇浙皖區·湘鄂區、多為華廠勢力範圍、魯豫區·中日廠勢力各半、粵桂閩區·由華廠及瑞商盤據、蘇浙皖區·則爲華廠·外廠·及進口商逐角之地、目前上海各廠銷路、即如蘇浙皖區爲尾閭、區內共劃市塲六處、一爲上海蘇州及附近各埠、二爲南京鎭江及江北一帶、三爲徐州蚌埠臨淮附近、四爲蕪湖安慶、五爲寗波溫州台州一帶、六爲杭州嘉興湖州三處、市塲競爭最大者、則首推南京、蓋上海火柴、輸入內地、多先集於南京、然後再分銷於長江一帶、　　二·外貨競爭外商火柴、分進口貨爲在華製造者二種、上海之外廠、僅有美光廠一家、出產頗多、銷路亦廣、往昔盛銷於漢口及厦門附近、近以該地課稅綦重、及改向蘇浙推銷、致蘇浙皖區、又多一廠貨品之競爭、進口貨、以日俄瑞典貨品最多、蘇俄之老虎牌火柴、曾一度在華傾銷、近已逐次减少、瑞典火柴、歷年進口最多、傾銷尤勁、貨品商標、在商標局註册者、共有二十七種之多、如轆輪·如意·財神·飛虎·鍾馗·警鐘·玫瑰·廟宇·三山·馬蹄·金鳳·等、日貨火柴、以橋牌·猴牌·鳳凰牌銷路最廣、往昔與瑞典火柴、並駕齊驅、後以抵制日貨、銷路大减、瑞典火柴、復乘機傾銷、更受影響、惟目前在市塲中、仍佔有一部份勢力、茲據海關中外貿易統計年刋所載、外國火柴三年來進口數額、特列表如下、</p>
<p>據上表所示、外洋火柴進口總額、民國二十一年爲三七〇·九八九籮、二十二年爲七二·九七六籮、較上年計减二九八·〇一三籮、二十三年、爲一〇九·七五六籮、較二十二年、雖增三六·七八籮、但較二十一年、仍减二六一·一二三籮、故近年來外洋火柴進口之减少、實足以助長國產火柴業之進展、　　三·銷數上海各廠火柴之銷路、一般小廠、多以本埠及附近各埠爲主、貨本雄厚如大華美光等公司、除本埠市塲外、並遍及於浙江及長江一帶、往昔銷額、因受瑞典火柴傾銷影響、殊爲有限、自二十年一月、火柴進口率增高後、外洋火柴進口較减、各廠銷路、漸有生氣、迨二十二年、政府驟增高額統稅、各廠成本加重、售價較高、銷路又受影響、迄至今日、仍有逐减之勢、試觀各廠三年來火柴之銷額、可知火柴業衰落之一斑、</p>

<p>今年火柴市價旣低、外貨競爭又烈、各華廠丁茲時艱、經營殊屬匪易、幸同業日趨合作、共謀補救、大中華火柴公司、復聯合本埠大華·中國·大明·及外埠止大·通燧·淮上·民生·楚勝等火柴公司、組織國產火柴聯合營業辦事處、俾統制營業、劃一市價、開闢銷路、平衡產銷、此未始非火柴業前途之曙光也、（完）</p>

<p>「可是，我的寳，你要那麽疲倦，幷且又是很熱，你是不侖高興的。等我去時同去，我們可以去個整天，把野莓采得一大筐一大筐，回來。」</p>
<p>「你總是個不去，你總是忙着，我等得不耐煩了。我倒願去，獨自一人為你摘野莓，我愛這件事，我要把我的新手桶裝得滿滿的」，羅勃帶泣帶說道。</p>
<p>大淚珠卜東卜東落入可愛的新手桶，彷彿裏面不裝黑莓，而反將盛滿了鹽水，—這幅悲哀的情境使在塲的婦女們看了莫不深深感動，他的母親輕輕拍着他的背，希望他可以止哭，小梅表示願意留在家裏陪着他；唐恩則以其平日果毅的態度說道：</p>
<p>「讓他來罷；我會照管他的。」</p>
<p>「假如拂朗也去，我就可以不担心，因爲他是很謹愼的；可是他現在正在帮父親割草，對於你們別的人我就不能放心」裴夫人開始說着。</p>
<p>解客忽然揷嘴道，「路是太遠了。」</p>
<p>「我願意抱他，假如我去的話，—可惜我沒得去，」唐恩嘆息道。</p>
<p>「謝謝你的好意，你還得保護你的脚。我願我自己能够去。呀，我想我們到底還有辦法的，」裴太太說了，就跑到門外的階沿上，揮着她的圍裙。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨工業在今日的地位，可說是困難達到極點了。我好幾次聽到經營國貨事業的人都說：辦國貨工廠眞不是人辦的，以後吿訴我們的子子孫孫，不要再辦工廠，來捱受這種痛苦，憤慨怨懟的情狀，隨處是在表現出來，目下國貨工業，處在這種惡劣環境之下，確是一件可嘆可痛的實情。所以有許多熱心國貨的人，都替他們關心策劃，研究種種積極的辦法。有的請求减輕貸欵利率，有的請求頒布統制法規，有的請求修改不動產抵押放欵章程，有的請求接受國貨工廠抵押放欵，都是在新貨幣政策頒布以後，希望政府儘量運用法幣，爲復興工商業的大計。這種意見，我未嘗不肯贊同，可是天下事，自助纔能得到人助，自救纔能得到人救。以目下的情形，國貨工廠，同業傾軋，彼此嫉妒，自己還不能精神團結，希望政府，希望銀行，希望一般社會的帮助，據記者看來，都是沒有什麽把握的。遠者不必論，卽就最近情况來說，自法幣政策頒行之後，同業之間，對於貨價的確定，還是各自爲政，原料的進購，還是人自爲謀，開會等於具文，議案視若無覩，公衆的法規，不敵私人的權利，甚至破壞業規，違犯議案，悍然不顧一切，僅以私人的利益爲前提。這簡直是同業自殺，羣趨於絕路。吾總不解經營國貨事業的額袖，何以目光短淺胸襟狹隘如此？以年來政府的意見不一，派別分歧，五中全會，尙有精誠團結，海內一家，以羣赴國難之一日。國貨同業，究沒有深仇宿怨，糾結不解的關係，到了這困難臨頭，瀕於絕路的地步，爲什麽還不同心合作，精誠團結，起而爲同業自救之行動呢？記者認爲今日的國貨事業，惟合作纔能生存，惟自救纔能不歸於失敗。求人，求政府，求社會，都不是辦法，都沒有效騐。國難日深，風雲日急，大家起來罷！同業自救。</p>
<h3 id="c165">再談國紙 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 文伯</p>
<p>上期本刋有一篇意鴻先生所作的「請印刷界竭力採用國紙，」他把各紙廠的情形和現在社會各界對於採用國紙的態度，說得很詳細，現在我把我所知道的，再來補充一些，關於紙廠方面的情形如下：廠名出品種類龍章紙廠除連史紙道林紙外尙有牛皮紙和白報紙二種天章紙廠雖然現在暫時停頓可是也許就有復業的希望出品除道林紙圖畫紙書面紙外尙有毛月份牌紙木造紙吸水紙夫士紙等等江南紙廠連史，毛邊，玉扣，重貢，海月，（是做中式紙張最完備的紙廠）民豐紙廠黃版紙灰版紙白版紙同時也做捲烟紙竟成紙廠大華紙廠華盛紙廠都是製造黃版紙的森記紙廠上海紙廠寳山紙廠大中華紙廠都是製造毛邊連史和海月</p>
<p>以上各家出品，的確是很適於各種印刷，尤其是有幾種出品，不致於比不上舶來品，像龍章道林紙江南甲種連史等幾種。</p>
<p>至於國產紙張不能暢銷的原因，除了意鴻先生所提及幾種原因之外，另外還有幾種，就是以上各種出品的原料，除黃版紙之外，其餘大部份都是用外洋來的木漿，因此，原料成本的價格無形地被洋商操縱，各紙廠的生產力極少，工作成本因之增高，以上二點，也是不能使國紙暢銷的大原因。</p>
<p>意鴻先生又說，紙店不願推銷國紙，印刷所不用國紙來代替洋紙，是冷的態度，可是，我以爲這種情形倒不冷，更冷的是有一輩紙店和一輩印刷所；明明用了或出售價廉物美的國紙，在顧主面前仍說是來路貨，以博重利，在顧客方面能眞眞辨明國紙和洋紙的，能有幾人？明明用了國貨還不知是國貨，其他像用次一等洋貨來充國貨等等，這種的冷眞冷得更笑話了。</p>
<p>上海的紙店，大都是賣買洋紙的，不信只要到各紙店門前走過，就可以看見「某某外國紙行」「某某洋紙行」等的招牌，所以國紙在一般人的形影中是很淺很淺的。</p>
<p>最近本埠出現了一家大豐國產紙張公司（在棋盤街交通路）據說是專銷國產紙張，不賈一張洋紙，記者曾有一次親自去探望過，的確是一家純粹推銷國紙的紙店，店內幾個靑年的店員，都是精神飽滿，態度和氣，言語之間，不時與顧客談到國家的經濟，與採用國貨的利益，並且該店爲了要提倡國貨，所以價目特比別家便宜，我見了很欣喜，這實是國紙界中的一顆明星，特地介紹，希望印刷界愛護之。</p>

<p>我國近年來料學的進展，在表面上似乎很遲純的：實則却有特殊的進步。就是種種的小發明，相繼而出的已有許多了。</p>
<p>記得以前我曾把丁育三女士等的發明物介紹過了。今天復把東北人于捷三氏的發明滅火藥粉介紹出來。于氏經數年的苦心研究，歷多次的試騐，才做成一種完備的滅火藥粉。據于氏云：「此種藥粉，係集合各種含有二氧化碳（CO2）的物質，混合而成。富有持久的滅火性，其滅火能力，雖經四十分之久，亦不消滅，和先前一般」。的確，此種滅火藥粉，經試騐證明，它可使巳滅之火，無再燃燒的力量。並且藥粉中絕對沒有包含酸毒（Acids）等質，因此，雖遇人體或貴重物件，也無腐爛和損傷的危險。另外還有一點，實爲其他舶來品滅火器所不及，就是施于油類的燃燒，可浮於表面，撲滅極猛烈的火花。</p>
<p>目前于氏已向實業部取得專利權，擬在本埠成立辦事處，籌創大規模的滅火藥粉廠，以資我國人應用。現在于君已派代表金彝臣梅子英世榮庭等於日前到申，與本埠著名東北商人史炳焱等接洽籌備云。</p>

<h3 id="c169">「精神建設與民族復興」 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 仭千</p>
<p>周佛海著　新生命版　（價四角）</p>
<p>現在的中國是處於內憂外患交相煎迫的環境之下，於是，「怎樣復興民挨」就成爲近年來有識之士討論的中心。有的說，復興民族須先復興農村；有的說，復興民族須先普及敎育；更有人說要復興民族必須改革政制；總之，講論紛紜，莫衷一是。固然，復興農村，普及敎育等等確是復興民族的必要工作，但是因爲全民族沒有一顆共同的心，沒有一個共同的目標；指揮不能統一，步驟未能一致，努力也就徒勞無功。所以，復興民族的先决倏件，就是怎樣把全民族的意識統一在同一目樓之下，然後纔能發生集體的偉大力量。周佛海先生的「精神建設與民族復興」一書，就是爲此種需要而作成的。</p>
<p>本書共分五章，目次如下：（一）精神建設的意義和重要，（二）從歷史上觀察時代精神和民族盛衰的關係，（三）數十年來各種運動的演進及其失敗的總因，（四）精神建設的目標，（五）精神建設的原則和方案。</p>
<p>第一章說明什麽是精神建設及其重要性，他說：「我們覺得精神和物質，是交互爲用的。完成精神建設，正所以完成物質建設。因爲精神的要素浚有具備，精神的條件沒有充實，物質的建設，根本就不能完成。」又說：「一個民族的興亡，一個朝代的降替，小而至於一僩家庭的盛衰，一個人的成敗，原因雖然複雜，條件雖然繁多，不能以一元論的方式來說明；然而精神作用，可以說是根本原因和主要條件。民族將興，朝代將隆，家庭將盛，個人事業將成的時候，一定先具有一種發揚蹈厲，堅苦卓絕，勇猛精進的精神。反之，一個民族將亡，一個朝代將替，一個家庭將衰，一人的事業將敗的時候，一定先表現頽唐墮落，萎靡浪漫，巧詐虛浮的精神。」</p>
<p>第二章從中國歷史上來檢討時代精神和民族盛衰的關係，將五胡亂華，五代之亂，遼，金，元的侵入，和滿淸的統治四個時期，詳細分析研究，引爲漢族最痛心，最恥辱的時期；而所以釀成這種恥辱，無非因爲那時風氣敗壞，精神頽廢所致。</p>
<p>第三章是就鴉片戰爭帝國主義的勢力侵入中國起直到判最近數十年中各種運動的演進及其失敗，探索其原因。主要的幾種運動如造船製械運動，變法運動，民主運動，新文化運動等，對於當時都是十分切合於需要的，但是結果爲什麽失敗呢？周先生說：「這次運動之所以失敗的根本原因，就是缺乏足以使他們成功的精神的要素。不僅反對這些運動的人，大都出於自私自利的精神，就是直接間接參加這些運動的人，除掉極少數的領導者以外，也很少具有大公無私，忠實不欺的精神，……所以每次運動初起時，所具的莫大的希望，都被營私，舞弊，因循，虛浮，逞意氣，爭權利等敗壞的風氣，打得粉碎，變爲泡影了。」他又說到新文化運動所以失敗的原因：「新文化運動的性質，和上述三個時期的運動，因爲缺乏精神的要素，所以不能完成當時希望他們完成的任務；本身本是一種精神建設運動的新文化運動，却也因爲參加運動的人，大多數缺乏健全純正的精神，所以也不能完成其應負的使命。打破吃人的禮敎，本是改造不合人性，不近人情的舊風俗的必要途徑，然而儴薄少年，却藉這個口號去荒淫亂交；發展個性，也是改革舊式敎育的一種方法，然而不肖的學生，却因此主張廢止考試；其餘或利用自由解放的美名，不守社會的秩序，學校的紀律；或利用革命反抗的口號，在家反對父兄，在校驅逐師長：或以打倒偶像爲。實，而毀謗自己不願意的德高望重的前輩。總而言之：除極少數的領導者和純潔靑年以外，大多數都是以新文化運動為號召，而遂其私圖。因此，這種連動的結果，雖然喚記了一部分人認識舊社會的缺點，雖然也打破了一部分不良的風俗習慣，乃至傳統思想，然而即就他的好的方面說，其結果，也都是消極的，破壞的，沒啊積極的建設一種開創的精神，新興的風氣。換句話說，新文化運動，雖然他本身是一種精神建設運動，然而其結果，只做到精神的破壞，至於精神建設，却並沒有成功。因此我們希望他負担的復興民族的任務，也不能完成。」</p>
<p>第四章提出精神建設的目標：（一）要掃除因私害公的風氣，建設爲公忘私的精神。（二）要剷除敷衍，應付，和虛僞的風氣，建設忠於所事，忠於職責的精神。（三）要剷除互相推諉，互相責難的風氣，養成任勞，任難，任怨，任咎的精神。（四）要剷除冷淡的心理，養成狂熱的風氣。（五）剷除個人自由的風氣，養成嚴守紀律的精神。（六）要剷除卑鄙貪汚的惡習，榭立尙名節，重廉恥的風氣。</p>
<p>有了目標，必須要有方法去實行，所以本書的最後一章就是提出精神建設的原則和方案來。原則方面他規定了了二種，一種是自動的，希望各人自己覺悟；一種是被動的，即由外界的力量促成之。除了這二種辦法之外，我覺得還可以採取一種名譽懲戒的辦法，如果違反了精神建設的目標，即由團體的名義予以警吿，因爲「羞惡之心，人皆有之，」這在消極方面或可收到多少效果。最重要的，自然還在積極方面，一方面是利用學校敎育，極力把精神建設的意義及重要性貫輸給學生，一方面可利用社會敎育，如民衆敎育館，圖書館等等，常常舉行演講，表現等等，使其深入於民衆的心中。</p>
<p>最後，周先生提出了幾個方案：（一）領袖人物，要根據精神建設的目標，「以身作則」。（二）要根據精神建設的目標，登用人才。（三）要根據精神建設的目標，明定政府賞罰。（四）根據精神建設的目標，製造社會輿論。（五）根據精神建設的目標，勵行訓練。這幾個方法，當然是最切實最有效的方法，但最要緊的，我覺得莫如轉變社會的風氣，一方面領袖者以身作則，同時民衆們也萬衆一心，大家埋頭苦幹，俾民族復興工作之早日完成。</p>
<p>總之，這本書在現階段的中國是値得注意的，我希望本書之出版對於中華民族的精神建設發生偉大的作用！</p>
<h3 id="c170">介紹一本人類學書 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 譚輔之</p>
<p>在以前讀過好些關於人類學的書，但讀過後總有這樣的感覺：人類也同其他低等動物一樣，獉獉狉狉，完全營着自然生長的生活。即是說，我們在一般人類學書中只看到最原始的人類，完全屈服於自然法則下的人類。似乎人類幷沒有進化，即使進化，也是完全循着「優勝劣敗，適者生存」那樣純生物進化的法則進化。這樣一來，那末人類學也就是動物學了。而且，似乎在一般人類學書上，我們全看見一些被發掘的古人類的化石的陳列，比配，沒看見一個現代的人，活的人。而且，所謂人類也不過僩個的個人，實際不是人類——人羣。</p>
<p>我現在介紹的「人類學體系（辛墾書店版，劉敏著）一書便全然不同。首先它「把人類學置於自然科學與社會科學之間，」不似舊人類學之純爲自然科學。因爲人類這東西是自然的產物而同時又是社會的產物。只要是脫離了動物階段的人類，其本身就不僅要生息於自然之中而以自然爲其環境：幷且同時不能不生自於社會之中而以社會爲其環境。因爲這個原故，人類的進化一方面是循着自然法則——生物進化的法則，而一方面又服從社會發展的法則。人類愈進化，則受盲目的自然法則之支配便相對地更小，而受社會法則之支配便相對地更大。本書以社會學的觀點力說明了這點。</p>
<p>本着這基本觀點，它提出「人類生理進化中非自然的因素與其法則。」它說，動物只是受動地變異自己的器官去適應自然，而人類便能發展體外器官——工具來改變自然。「社會是减削自然支配人類之肉體器官的權威的東西，是轉移人類對於自然環境之生理的適應到體外器官的適應的工具。」人類到了這兒，其進化的程度便不是以生理之適應自然的程度來决定，而是以其社會的生產力來决定了。</p>
<p>動物的生活資料完全取給於自然，而「入類的生活資料則大部分依賴勞動生產品，其所需於同伴的扶助，遠在動物之上」。一人類愛羣的社會本能，常因這樣經濟的生活範圍之擴大而擴張」，所以人類的心理的進化大部分也依决於社會。</p>
<p>因之，學者爭論不淸的遺傳與環境問題，本書給了它一正確的解决，它以爲人類的遺傳性不能單從生理方面看，還得從社會方面看，因爲社會是人類的環境。所謂本能只是從來的環境所反映而由祖先承繼積蓄的機能，而這機能之所以能發揮，進化，則全有賴於現在的環境之誘致和薰陶，所以純全用生物學上的人爲淘汰的方法來講優生是不對的，要優生主要是改良環境——猶其社會環境。而且人類之進化是羣的進化，社會的進化，决不是個體的進化，生物的進化，所以優生學應是以社會的選擇來改良人種。「生物裏面弱者必須淘汰，而人類中則視其對於社會所能盡的責任而定。淘汰有利於社會的弱者，不但不是善的辦法，倒是害羣的舉動；反之保存無利於社會的强者，不但也非善種的辦法，而且也是害羣的舉動。」所以自稱白種人是天之驕子的帝國主義式的優生論，都是不懂得人類學。</p>
<p>馬雨薩斯的人口理論也是基於舊人類學的理論而來，它把「物競天擇」的道理來說明人類進化。但是人類進化有其生物進化法則以外的社會法則。「人類自己能生產」，而生物則否。「人類生活資料供給上的豐歉，要看生產力的進程。而人類生殖的效率與人口增加的標準，也就要看生產力發達與否爲轉移」。「人類的技術發展到可以改變自然環境時，那些自然條件所加於人類的制約漸漸表示無能時，人口的發展更有衝破天然的限界之勢。」</p>
<p>總之這一本根據新的理論和新的方法作的人類學，是把人類學由叙述科學抬到說明科學的地位了，幷且給人類本身指示出，人類不僅服從自然法則，而且已改變和克服自然法則；不僅受社會法則支配，而且要認識社會，根據社會必然法則去改造社會，人類已由必然正向自由前進了。</p>

<p>經過現代式訓練的店員不是沒有，商務等大書店且不說，如生活，對於店員的訓練便是很嚴的（這大概就是職業敎育的效果吧），店員的效率似乎也比別家爲佳。據說，他們所收的店員大多受過相當的現代敎育，也沒有學徒的制度，有之，那不過是現代式的練習生，不過，我們知道，在工業組織中，資本主義經營中的職工，有時的待遇反比家庭作坊爲劣，據說，在書業中也有同樣的情形。</p>
<p>書店的店員每月所得不過一二十元，就是女店員，雖則還有一筆裝飾上的額外支出，而所得報酬，也不過一二十元而巳。在此米珠薪桂的時期，自然是仰不足養父母，下不能養妻子的，於是，書店店員很少安心於其業，這使各書店的經理很感沒有好店員可用之苦。書店店員的出路是什麼呢？如不改行，那末，他們看到書籍成本與價格之間的差額之巨，便想僥倖自作「老闆」。有時我們看到祇印一二本書的書店，那便是店員想做老闆的嘗試，也有幸而成功的，其成績或收穫便是那些現有的家庭作坊式的小書店。至於如「創造社小夥計」周全平等似的，由店員一躍而爲作家的，實在不很多見。</p>
<p>（六）總編輯</p>
<p>我們說過總經理在新書店中地位的重要，但如和總編輯相比較的話，那末，總編輯更是新書店的靈魂。本來，在名義上說，每家新書店大多是分作營業部與編輯部二大部份，總編輯是編輯部的主持者，其地位巳够重要。何况更有甚於此者，即，一：有許多書店的開設，最初的目的是在出版書籍，尤其是用以達到某種目的的書籟，營業如何，倒還其次，在這種塲合，總編輯使是這書店的惟一靈魂，如總編輯的意向與開書店原來的目的不合，則此書店便是有等於無。二，有許多書店，名義上雖有編輯部，雖有幾個編輯，但在實際上，所謂編輯部是徒有其名的，幾個編輯的工作無吳於校對員，自然一切的出版方針全由總編輯一人的意向來决定。</p>
<p>明瞭了總編輯在新書店中的作用，對於各書店的出版趨向，即有綫索可尋，大概，各書店出書方針的决定，固有許多因素，但總編輯的意向，總是最大的决定勢力之一。譬如開明，在其初期，章先生由婦女雜誌的主編而爲新女性的主幹，對於婦女問題，自必較有興趣。因而關於這方面書籍的出版，也特別的多，稍後，夏先生主持編輯部，因他是個有歷史有經騐的中學敎師，於是造成了開明爲中學生的書店。新生命書店由陶樊先生等主持，所以關於中國問題及國際政治經濟的書籍出版得最多。黎明書店始終由孫伍先生主持編輯部，所以政治經濟的書籍，尤其大學敎本，與英文文學書，出版了不少。北新在語絲社諸君未脫離以前，是一個有名的文學書籍出版機關，後來，自趙先生主持以後，作風即爲一變。再如與本來與商務對時的中華，近年來雖有新書出版，雖不太壞，但也沒有特色，在出版的種類中，好像敎育方面的書籍成份較多，這與舒先生自然不無關係。也有本身一無所偏，亦即一無所長的總編輯，他對於出版的决定，自然是莫明其妙。大東在擴充時收下大景稿件，結果不是沒有出版，便是出版了也少有人要，那當然要由編輯負責的。</p>
<p>關於書的出版，由編輯部份工審查計劃的不是沒有，不過大多的新書店規模都不很大，除總編輯外，有三個以上的編輯（校對員及「事實上」的校對員除外）的書店，實不很多。即以編輯部略具規模的書店來說，如開明，雖有多位編輯，而職權總是有所偏的，編輯部分工最細的是商務，但是書籍的最後决定取捨，還是在於王先生。所以，即使我們說：在新書店中，總編輯（總經理兼任的自也在內）無例外的是書店的靈魂，也不爲過。</p>
<p>因爲總編輯的地位是這樣的重要，所以各書店對於總編輯的人選特別重視——不，事實上各書店的總編輯無所謂其選」的。爲出書而開辦的書店，其總編輯自然即是書店的開辦人，否則，各書店的總編輯也必是與書店關係最密的人，如大股東，董事，或創辦人的親信之類。所以，有許多新書店，總經理頗有常換的，而總編輯掉換的却不多見。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能不提那些純粹商業性的書店。在這種書店中，老闆或創辦人對於總編輯的職務多是外行，他們的關係人也很少是內行，於是遂不得不去請教外人。因爲有這種書店的存在，曾有一個時候，總編輯也成爲文人逐鹿的目的物之一。角逐總編輯，也和官僚逐鹿綠位一樣，很多是用盡卑陋的手段，甚且利用政治的力量，來對這種書店的老闆壓迫，當時，有幾個書店中，很有幾個「欽差」編輯的存在。就爲了這樣，有幾家書店遂不得不常換總編輯，有幾家，就在總編輯的幾次掉換中，閉門大吉。如新宇宙等，便是這種情形下的犧牲者。</p>
<p>如純粹站在新書業的立塲，來論斷總編輯的好壞，則總編輯究應具備那幾種資格呢，我們以爲，總編輯因需要較高深的學術基礎，但不能有過深的偏見，而且應該對於各部門的學術，都應有多少認識。一個書店與其請一位學術特別高深而無一般常識的專家，還不如請一位對於各方面都有相當常識的文人。此外，總編輯對於出書，不但要顧到市塲關係，而且，還要顧到學術的價値，並以學術的影響，去改變市塲關係——即誠書空氣。（未完）</p>

<p>治療淋病。方法甚多。最重要者。爲頓挫療法。即於淋病初染之時。用一定之藥液。液洗尿道。以撲滅淋菌。而在短時日治愈之謂也。然而此種方法。非經醫師直接指導之下。不適於病家之自療。因淋菌由外尿道感染。如果自療之法。行之不得其當。反使淋菌深入。釀成膀胱及其他疾患。自療法中。最簡易而安全者。即病人宜將流出於尿道外口之膿汁。以及浮腫之包皮與龜頭。時時用冷開水洗凈。多飲開水以利尿。服膀胱尿道防腐劑。如Urottopin及Salol之類。禁止煙酒酸辣之刺戟品。凡足以興奮神經。及引起淫慾觀念之事。皆宜避去。至於治淋之內服藥。當以上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社發行之「哥那多登」丸Tals　Conotodon爲最有效。取其服法簡便。而收效較洪。且此藥特具透膜殺菌之功。尤爲合理的淋病自療劑也。</p>

<h3 id="c181">戲謔 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>據廿五日各夜報載，電影明星胡蝶新居，被人向救火會虛報火警，致勞救火會空勞一趟。並據潘有聲云：「日來外界來電晝夜不輟，不下數百起，語多戲謔，實不勝其煩」。</p>
<p>從上面這簡短的新聞裏，我們至少可以看出以下二點：一，莫名化妙的影迷對于所愛好（談不到愛護）的明星突然感到失望，於是施以報復，而由于愛好太深，因之報復的手段也超過了「喫不到葡萄，說葡萄酸」的程度，而變成了行動，更因了一般國民性的庸怯的緣故，所以報復的手段，也祗是到了「戲謔」爲度。二，近年來明星制度所造成的結果，電影成了畸形的發展，所謂「影迷」也者，他所愛好的，不是電影而是明星，因之，電影明星的一舉一動，便成了影迷注意的中心，平日的私生活，不厭其詳地多方探聽，已經够顯出「忠心」了，一旦和人結婚，而和她（或他）結婚的，却又不是電影從業員，自然更免不到有一番騷動。從上述「不下數百起，語多戲謔」來證明，便足見一班。</p>
<p>現在姑就談談所謂「戲謔」的問題。</p>
<p>咱們中國的所謂報復手段，一向是很可憐的。小三子被强有力的大六子欺了，小三子便偸偸地背着人在小六子家的墻上，門上寫着「大六子是小五車」幾個字，算是報復，一等「小五車」寫過，精神上得了勝，阿Q老先也就成了被兒子打的老子？於是高唱「我手執鋼鞭將你打」，凱旋而歸。</p>
<p>胡蝶家的被人虛報火警，以及那「不下數百次」的「語多戲謔」的電話，便是阿Q先生精神勝利的遺傳。</p>
<p>自然，時代是進步的，阿Q先生也就比「被兒子打」時代進了一步，他不僅會「精神勝利」，他並且會使對方喫一些不大不小的苦，例如「虛報火警」，便是一例。</p>
<p>不過，這進一步的「精神勝利」，於實際上，還祇是五十步之與百步，阿Q先生並沒有股胎換面。並且，照這樣下去，阿Q先生是决不會脫胎換骨的。</p>
<p>於此，我們並不是鼓勵仇殺，我終感到仇殺是比較「戲謔」來得光明，來得出息。固然，在現在個人英雄主義是根本行不通的，卽使是能够殺盡，這種殺盡也往往流於偏激，流於淺見，使人祇看到世界的色小的一角，而不見其全貌。而戲謔呢，除了味于理智，流于偏見之外，也實在更找不出和仇殺有什麼分別來</p>
<p>兩者之問除了手段的不回，簡直就是同爹娘的孿生子。——同是可可憐的民族圖窮七見的最後一套戲法。</p>
<p>然而，這可憐見的民族，就盛行這一套圖窮七見的戲法。他們噴水於理智，困於淺見，閉着眼的祇逞一時之快的盲幹一陣，於事實究竟何補？於敵人有什麼損害或威脅？全不計較。</p>
<p>至於自己做了圈套給自己鑽，向電影明星「戲謔」，那臭然更淺薄可笑。</p>
<h3 id="c182">夜雨聲 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>一連幾朝的陰晦天氣，眞叫人有點難受了。當抬頭望見天空堆着的積雲，又立卽使人担心討厭的會雨落下來。假使是冬天，當着這樣的天氣，戶外又正刮着獵獵的北風，那還可以把沉悶無聊的心情移轉到下雪情景的想像里去；或者在溫暖的爐旁，聚三五友儕，燙半杯熱酒，邊談邊笑的把日子打發開去就算了。可是，現在可還是秋殘冬初的時候，在這江南地方，下雪還非其時。那堆在天空的積雲，一定會把雨天做成起來的。</p>
<p>對於雨，只有給我討厭的分，我之厭惡雨，理由很簡單。假使我現在是住在上海市街里，臨窗下面就是四通八達的柏油馬路，也許當着下雨時，會安閑無事的凭在玻璃窗口，欣賞一下雨中的街景。此地只是上海郊外的一個小鎭，雨天只有使這小鎭變得寂寞冷落起來，路也泥濘難走了。人也只有終日守在房子裏，聽滴篤的檐溜伴着無聊賴的心情挨着一秒一分的時光，不由人不感到這閑着的日子是如何難過下去，什麼都成了縹緲無倚，不可捉摸。若是晴天，這小鎭可會顯出牠固有的美好的地方：野草離離的田原，靑嫩如茵的菜畦，變了色的楓樹烏桕的葉子，河浜上浮遊的船家，朝霞晚照，雲影鳥聲，這些景地都够供我流連玩味，給我得到暫時的沉醉，滌除去鬱結在心胸的生活的陰影；又當朝晚日中，倦讀神疲之際，一杯開水，安安閑閑的當門而坐，細聽弄門口走出走進的小販的市聲，或籬外道上咿呀咿呀的小車的輪響；或又站在弄門電燈柱旁，目送着風馳而去的隱沒在林叢里的車塵，我就覺得這個小鎭的空氣是和諧而新鮮的，它就這應平平淡淡的給我過着一些蟄居生涯的日子。</p>
<p>但是，這會破壞這小鎭的美的雨到底落下了，以午後起卽一陣急一陣地的</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>落着，天空似乎也變得更低了。一直到現在我將要卸衣安息的深夜，弄內和籬外道上冷冷落落的，每夜掌燈時分卽敲着析子打弄口而過的餛飩担子，檀香橄欖的賣叫，野狗發狂的奔逐行人，車響，都寂然了，再也聽不見什麽聲息，好這像些聲音從來就沒有在這小鎭上動蕩。</p>
<p>假使就這麽冷靜下去，我想至多也不過給我一個短暫的寂寞之感覺罷了，這時候是深夜，橫豎都得躱到牀上去安息，定不會像日問那麼只有守在房子里發悶，威到日子的漫長無聊賴。可惜情形又偏不如此順適，我可眞不由不埋怨今秋的西風到底太過留情了。秋已到了末季，雖說是江南地方，梧桐葉子原該早就落盡了的，（古人不是有句「秋盡江南草木凋」的詩句麼）現在可怎麼樣呢，排植在籬邊的幾株法國梧桐葉子，這是無恙地吊在枝上，作成了今夜的擾人的繁音。</p>
<p>在我入睡之前，這兩聲會不會停止的呢，心里可眞惦罣得很。我又不由想起李義山的「留得殘荷聲雨聲」的名句，這大約也是指在夜里去聽秋雨打在殘荷葉上的繁聲而說的罷。這原是極風雅瀟洒之至的淸興，非雅人是體味不出來的。我若使稍識這種淸趣，也許今夜的雨打梧桐，大可恬然自樂，說不定還會撩起詩思寫出一二首紀實的詩文來。</p>
<p>但可惜——其實是慚愧，我到底是一個利碌之徒，生活的苦味早把我的心情腐蝕得變了顏色，由於這兩聲，不由不想到明朝的泥濘的路，像這樣難走的路，正有形無形，若遠若近的在等待我去跋涉！</p>
<p>唉，今夜的雨聲，我只奸對着牠發一回大息了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">討賬 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 樂筧</p>
<p>—城紀事之一。</p>
<p>背著破舊的行囊，踏着時序的烟霞，在外邊法轉了好些漫長的年歲；貪婪着蠻荒的生活，便又携了一顆疲憊的心，忽遽地回到山城來，滿想總會有些淸新的日子吧。</p>
<p>山城裏的曦光在灰塵中探了出來，殘照也在灰塵中歛了回去。拭得十分淸凈的桌几，經不了一會兒工夫，便給一層厚厚的塵土蒙上了。每次僥倖地賣掉一包殺蟲劑，或是一瓶止血藥，　　　蒙着塵土的長凳上記下賬目。可是我很快地威到看守店門的枯燥了，我需要山中風光和新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>這天，四叔頂便把一冊收賬手摺交給我，要我沿途討一點舊賬，並且吿訴我路由，賒賬的人家的居屋，是茅草的或是磚石的，和討賬的一套口訣。清早我便動身了，携着一大串殷紅的荔枝，在路上還摘了一條柳枝編成一頂遮陽帽。</p>
<p>走在蜿蜒的山徑上面，岩石溪流是蒼勁的，喬松板橋是潑墨的，山城扔在遠處的山腰間，岑寂得像一座墳墓。</p>
<p>不是我趕着山途，而是山途伸長着崎嶇而不着邊際的身子，叫我耐心地追尋着盡頭的一個村子，對我挪揄着。終於我是必然地疲倦了，心裏懷着幾分彷徨的尤怨。</p>
<p>手裏的荔枝剝究的時候，我開始踏上碎石子的村路，熱烈地歡迎着我的是一窩野蜜蜂，和一羣蝗蟲一般的牛棚裏的蚊子，冷靜地經待着我的是狹窄的陋巷，和數不淸的頹牆傾圯。我挨戶按着手摺上的人象唸着名字。</p>
<p>便在發了霉的柴扉叩門，站在土園的外邊叫喚，或是倚在頹牆垠下等待，坐在紡織旁邊催促，但是一家又一家，我所能討得的，不是藥賬，而是一堆嘮叨的苦求和怨語。</p>
<p>「先生，你是明白人：人家患了天花，只到菩薩跟前燒兩柱香，一對時便好啦。吃你們兩服藥水，不到幾天把孩子弄得差點兒便……還是觀世音菩薩救活了他的呢！」</p>
<p>「那時不應該叫大夫的，虎抓的傷是見慣的事；一大瓶止血藥水那里有一撮靑絲烟來得靈騐哩？不說別的，我看那瓶藥水還是白水攪紅丹的，希奇煞人。</p>
<p>聽着這些牽扯不淸的話，我只是沉默着，拖着土牆上的影子走開；抹了個角走進一條悽凉味的陋巷。</p>
<p>三橡瓦屋，兩扇破舊的黑漆大門，原是有錢的人家，四叔曾醫好了一個男人，手摺上的賬已經寫下好久的了。</p>
<p>我站在門外直往裏望，沒看見人，輕輕地叩着門環，沒看見人，像走進一所殯舍那麽地陰森，終於我喚了一聲：</p>
<p>「喂！守屋的人有嗎？城裏西醫店要算一點賬目。」</p>
<p>漸漸地看見廂房裏有鐵鏈鏗鏘的聲響，我退了兩步。</p>
<p>「呀」的一聲，房門猛的開了，一個中年的婦人出現在房間裏，她的衣服撕得粉碎襤褸，手足都上了枷鎖，兩隻山狼似的赤眼瘋狂地望住我，堵着嘴像要向我衝過來。</p>
<p>「哼！你來得正好，到他棺材裏去討債吧！討債鬼你來，你來！」她嘶聲地吆喝着，休閒鞋命地去抓住一隻三腳矮凳，猛的拋了過來，差點兒劈開我的腦袋，我逃了。</p>
<p>遠遠地我還聽見駭人的怒吼，捺不住一串砰砰的心跳。</p>
<p>在回來的山途上，我想起瘋婆子及殉節故事。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Tianjin, Fengtai and Other Stations: Armed Japanese Troops Detain Trains, Delaying Both Passenger and Freight Services; After Negotiations Between the Railway Authorities and Tada, All Trains Resume Operation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 10:01 AM on the 27th, more than 40 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin, aboard an armored vehicle, loaded a heavy military freight car and planned to depart at 12:05 PM. The loading of goods was not yet completed. The Japanese also monitored and investigated the train numbers in the stationmaster's office and at the station. Some also entered the West Freight Depot to inspect the number of passenger and freight cars stored there. At the same time, the Beining Railway Bureau also received a phone call from the Fengtai stationmaster reporting that the same thing had happened at that station. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 5:50 AM this morning, when the seventh train of the Beining Railway departed from Beiping, a group of Japanese soldiers, about 60 or more, traveled on the train. When passing Fengtai, they all got off the train and found six civilian houses near Tianxing Inn north of the station as residences, seemingly intending to stay for a long time. In addition, six Japanese military vehicles arrived in Fengtai from Beiping, carrying two small cannons and many military supplies. After the Japanese troops arrived in Fengtai, the Daxing County Government Public Security Bureau sent personnel to inquire about the truth, but the Japanese troops did not respond. The local situation remained peaceful as usual, with no unusual signs. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Fengtai stationmaster reported to Tianjin that on the morning of the 27th, more than 60 Japanese soldiers arrived at Fengtai from Beiping on a Beining Railway train. The soldiers were fully armed and carried one cannon. After arriving at Fengtai, they set up sentry posts at the East Station and at the intersection of the Pinghan and Beining Railways, set up military telephones, and contacted the Japanese army headquarters in Beiping and Tianjin. Some of the troops found accommodation in Tianxing Inn next to the station, while others occupied civilian houses. Subsequently, their officers led troops to the station to monitor the stationmaster. At the same time, they notified the Pinghan stationmaster that they must not issue route permits or allow southbound vehicles to pass. At that time, joint freight cars of the Beining and Pinghan Railways were about to pass through the station to transfer south on the Pinghan Railway, but were stopped by the Japanese army. Northbound trains on the Pinghan Railway were allowed to pass without obstruction. The Japanese soldiers investigated all the vehicles of the two railways stored at Fengtai Station and recorded the car numbers in a book. Other Pingjin (Beiping-Tianjin) trains and Pingsui trains were allowed to pass without obstruction. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 150 Japanese soldiers from Yuguan arrived in Beiping on the 26th and were stationed in the Japanese barracks and the Yamato Club on Sandiao Street, Dongdan. More than 90 of these Japanese soldiers were fully armed and carried a large number of military supplies. They departed for Fengtai at 5:45 AM on the 27th. After getting off the train, they guarded the station, inspected incoming and outgoing trains, and stopped the Pinghan-Pupu joint transportation. A company of the 29th Army stationed at the station temporarily withdrew from the station to avoid conflict. (27th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway Bureau reported the Japanese army's detention of trains to the Telegraph Department on the 27th and to Yin Tong in Beijing, and requested instructions on how to deal with the situation. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 27th, the Beining Railway Bureau issued a general order to all stations along the line, as well as personnel at the Xinhe Materials Factory, Tangshan Datong Yuguan Bridge Factory, to work with peace of mind and prevent traitors from sabotaging railway administration. (27th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Juesheng, chief of staff of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, said that the Japanese army's request to stop the transfer of train cars between the Beining and Pinghan Railways at Fengtai was purely a misunderstanding. Recently, the Japanese army noticed that a large number of train cars from the Beining Railway were being transferred south, which caused dissatisfaction. This kind of minor issue can be easily resolved. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Three Solutions Were Decided by Both Sides</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At around 10:00 AM on the 27th, the Tianjin Japanese Garrison dispatched an armored car and three heavy vehicles carrying more than 30 armed soldiers to the main station. At that time, the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) Express Train No. 21 southbound had already left the station, and the passenger-freight train No. 75 bound for Jinan was preparing to depart. The Japanese soldiers immediately stepped forward to stop the train from departing. At the same time, an officer led soldiers into the Jinpu stationmaster's office, claiming that the southbound train could not leave. At that time, Express Train No. 21 had arrived at the West Station and was intercepted by Japanese soldiers at that station. Subsequently, the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway heard the news and Director Gao Hengru, together with Lu Mengxiong, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, visited Commander Tada to inquire about the matter. After the two sides verbally agreed on (1) not to allow empty train cars to go south, (2) not to transport troops, and (3) one train going south must be accompanied by one train going north, the issue was resolved. The Japanese army headquarters then sent personnel to the two stations to notify the troops to return to the camp. Express Train No. 21 was delayed by three hours, and Train No. 75 was delayed by 40 minutes. According to transportation circles, the Pinghan joint transportation trains at Fengtai were also stopped at the same time on the morning of the 27th. It is said that the same solution was reached. (27th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun is negotiating with the Japanese Embassy regarding the stationing of Japanese troops at the Fengtai Guang'anmen Station. Takahashi said that it was to monitor the concentration of empty train cars from various lines going south, and they will withdraw in two or three days. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the train detention incident occurred, Lu Mengxiong, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Bao Xifan, Director of the Transportation Department, Li Tieshan, Counselor, and Gao Heng, Director of the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, went to the Japanese Garrison Headquarters to visit Commander Tada. The negotiations ended at noon, and a temporary solution was reached. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 27th, a Lieutenant Oida of the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters went to the Jinpu Railway Station to convey the results of the meeting between Lu, Gao, and Tada to the stationmaster. Then, he led the troops back to Haiguang Temple. The Jinpu passenger train No. 21 departed at 12:01 PM, and the freight train No. 75 departed at 12:40 PM. The Beining-Pinghan joint transportation train was allowed to depart south by the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters via telephone notification to its troops, departing south at about 1:00 PM. Freight train No. 405 of the Jinpu Railway, which was originally under surveillance, was also allowed to depart in the afternoon. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Southbound Jinpu Trains Stop at Jinan</p>
<p>(Tianjin) All southbound trains on the Jinpu Railway are now stopping at Jinan due to the demands of the Japanese military authorities. Initially, the Japanese military intended to completely halt all transportation on the Jinpu Railway, but later agreed to a compromise. This morning, a team of Japanese soldiers went to the Jinpu Railway Station here to demand the suspension of operations, but the Chinese authorities refused. After consultation, the Japanese side agreed to allow trains to operate, but on the condition that southbound trains do not go beyond Jinan. This action directly caused northbound trains to be detained in North China. (27th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources from the Chinese side, 90 Japanese soldiers who departed from here at 5:00 AM this morning have taken over the Fengtai Railway Station. It is said that after the Japanese soldiers arrived at the station, they intended to stop transportation, but were persuaded by railway staff to allow trains to operate as usual. The Japanese soldiers requisitioned a number of passenger and freight cars from the Pinghan Railway and took over the Chinese military telephone lines. Fengtai is located 12 miles south of Beiping, on the Beiping-Tianjin line, not far from the border of Yin Rugeng's Jidong "Autonomous State". (25th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After occupying the Fengtai Railway Station, the Japanese soldiers also occupied the Zhangyimen Railway Station. The station is located about 300 yards outside the southwest gate of Beiping, on a branch line connecting the routes to Tianjin and Zhangjiakou. Therefore, by occupying these two stations, the Japanese soldiers were able to control all the railways in North China. Trains between Beiping and Tianjin are now operating as usual, and trains to Hankou are also still running. (27th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese military spokesman said that the Japanese army's occupation of Fengtai and the seizure of military telephone lines were for the purpose of protecting transportation and preventing the southward migration of vehicles from Beiping, canceling the semi-official explanation issued by the Japanese side that the Japanese army was only engaged in exercises. (27th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a semi-official Japanese explanation regarding the Japanese army's occupation of the Fengtai Railway Station, the Japanese troops from Tangshan and the guards of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping are currently conducting exercises, so they are conducting an experiment of occupying the Fengtai Railway Station and seizing trains and telephone lines, because the Japanese army will take these actions in the event of a real war. After the exercise is completed, the Japanese troops will return the station. In recent years, whenever the Chinese political situation has been tense, the Japanese army has often conducted exercises within the Chinese border here, which has become commonplace, but this occupation of the Fengtai Railway Station, trains, and telephone lines has greatly alarmed the Chinese.

<h3 id="e44">Pacific Aviation Officially Opens <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the first American ship sailed from San Francisco to Guangzhou. Since then, Pacific shipping has become increasingly busy. The travel of merchants between East and West and the communication of cultures have progressed rapidly. Recently, Pacific aviation has officially opened. Transportation between the United States and the Far East, which used to take three or four weeks, has now been reduced to five or six days. This is truly like the ancient art of shrinking the land!</p>
<p>United Air Lines has been preparing for scheduled Pacific flights for several years. It has built three large four-engine flying boats. The "China Clipper," which departed from San Francisco on the 23rd of this month for the first Pacific flight, is the premier large aircraft in the United States. Its sister ship, the "Philippine Clipper," will also join the air route. The first one built, the "Oriental Clipper," has been conducting test flights since March of this year. It has made four thorough round-trip tests between San Francisco and Midway Island in the center of the Pacific. The "China Clipper" is currently flying over the Pacific and is proceeding smoothly. It is expected to reach its final destination, Manila, tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Pacific aviation planned by United Air Lines originally had three major trunk lines, all with San Francisco as the main station. The one that has now opened is its first line. It was originally planned to have Guangzhou in our country as the final destination, but this was not achieved due to obstacles from certain parties. Later, it was proposed to choose either Hong Kong or Macau, but negotiations have not yet reached an agreement. The final decision was to make Manila the final destination. The entire route is 8,000 kilometers long. After the U.S. Post Office Department approved the opening in June, the Philippine government also granted the company a 20-year operating license in October. The second line will have Auckland, New Zealand, as the final destination. A contract has now been signed with the New Zealand authorities and will open in July next year. The section of this line from San Francisco to Honolulu is the same as the first line. However, after arriving in Honolulu, it will turn south, passing through Kingman Reef and Pago Pago Island to Auckland. The entire line is 6,500 kilometers long and can be reached in about three days. The third leg will end in Melbourne or Darwin, Australia. The British Airways-operated scheduled air route has already connected London to Seletar in Australia. The connecting method of the two lines has not yet been agreed upon. There is no indication of when it will open.</p>
<p>The vast Pacific Ocean is now opening scheduled air services for the first time. What is the significance of this? From a commercial perspective, the airline's revenue, based on current postal transport alone, reaches about US$16,000 per trip. This cannot be said to be an unprofitable new business. As for the military aspect, it is not without its uses. The United States has been expanding its air force in recent years, sparing no effort. The annual report of the U.S. Navy Department at the end of last year listed the formation flight achievements from Panama to the United States and from the U.S. mainland to Hawaii and Alaska, believing that the U.S. air force's strength could be called invincible in the world. In March of this year, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson reserved the right to occupy these airports in emergencies when authorizing airlines to develop airfields on Guam, Wake Island, and Midway Island. In August, President Roosevelt approved the Wilcox Aviation Act, which added six army aviation bases on the east and west coasts to defend the Panama Canal and Alaska, and designated the waters around the Aleutian Islands as naval aviation bases. Thus, the United States clearly wants to use aircraft to assist warships to engage in controlling the Pacific. The opening of Pacific aviation is a corroboration of this.</p>

<p>The League of Nations announced tonight that Germany has promulgated a decree prohibiting the transportation of military supplies to belligerent countries. Iron, nickel, tin, etc. are all included in the ban. Germany sent the decree to member states of the League of Nations. The general consensus in Geneva is that Germany's move will greatly contribute to the collective security system and the efforts of League of Nations member states to impose sanctions on Italy. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>The Houston-Lakes Steamship Company, following instructions from the U.S. Maritime Commission, declared that its ships traveling between the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea will no longer carry military supplies to the East African war zone.

<p>New Orleans – The two steamship companies that are the only ones operating between the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea today announced that they have stopped accepting shipments of kerosene, steel, and freight cars to the European war zone. Cotton will continue to be transported as usual. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) After meeting today, the Committee of Imperial Defence issued a statement saying that Britain continues to support collective action in implementing an oil embargo against Italy and that Britain continues to support the League of Nations but does not intend to seek to represent other member states in implementing the League of Nations Covenant. Military experts here believe that if the League of Nations imposes an embargo on oil, coal, and steel, it could defeat Italy within four months. However, it is also generally believed that this move will cause Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to take risks, leading to a European war. According to American news, Washington feels that the United States' position has exceeded the League of Nations' actions, so it is unwilling to implement an oil embargo. Today's British statement may have been issued because of this. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government ordered today that, starting at midnight on December 15, all oil company storage tanks must be filled to 70% capacity with gasoline or kerosene and that they will be prohibited from being used thereafter without special permission. Well-informed observers say that the United States' suspension of kerosene supplies to Italy may be regarded as a hostile act, so corresponding countermeasures must be taken. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini once suggested that the Mediterranean Naval Pact issue and the Abyssinian issue should be discussed together. This has now been agreed to by Britain. If British-Italian negotiations progress smoothly, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Vansittart may be ordered to go to Rome. According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently told British Ambassador to Italy Drummond when he met him, "We are now discussing things in the same tone for the first time." It is also heard that Britain has agreed to a wide range of negotiations, but for the time being, it will be limited to outstanding issues between Britain and Italy. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that British Prime Minister Baldwin did not hand over a handwritten letter to Mussolini through Drummond. However, after consulting with Foreign Secretary Hoare, Baldwin sent Drummond a special instruction, giving him detailed guidance on British-Italian negotiations. Because the British general election is now over and the weakness of the British naval power in the Mediterranean is undeniable, Baldwin is eager to take the opportunity to remove obstacles in British-Italian relations. Also, with the London Naval Conference approaching, Italy may raise the issue of the internationalization of traffic in the Strait of Gibraltar and the port of Alexandria, leading to many disputes. Therefore, Britain is also eager to discuss the Mediterranean naval issue with Italy before the London Naval Conference. As for the negotiations between British and French experts in Paris, it is said that they are progressing smoothly. When British Foreign Office Abyssinian issue expert Peterson was ordered to go to France, he was instructed by the government to return home last week if the negotiations failed. However, Peterson is still in Paris, indicating that the negotiations will not be fruitless.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Italian Ambassador to Britain Drummond notified the British Foreign Office this morning that the Italian military headquarters in East Africa, compelled by the military situation, had to attack the Lake Tana area in western Abyssinia. The Gonder region is expected to be captured next week. As western Abyssinia is more closely related to British interests, Mussolini is eager to negotiate with London to discuss how to protect British interests. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) Although all countries participating in the naval conference have sent representatives, the British delegation, in addition to Foreign Secretary Hoare, has not yet finalized its members. The conference is expected to open around December 6th with a ceremony held by Prime Minister Baldwin and short speeches by legal representatives from each country. The British government's policy remains unchanged from what it has expressed in preliminary talks with relevant countries over the past two years. Britain believes that continuing to pursue suggestions based on any ratio is useless and hopes to limit the tonnage of various types of warships to establish quantitative limits. Countries can allocate the construction of warships within the set limits in the way they deem best. So far, no compromise has been reached among the countries, but lessons have been learned in preliminary talks, and they all attach great importance to establishing a compromise on qualitative and quantitative limits.

<h3 id="e49">Italy-Abyssinia War; Only Southern Front Active; Italian Troops Withdraw from Gorahei and Three Other Locations <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(London) Only the southern front is active in Abyssinia today. According to Abyssinian authorities, Italian troops on the southern front are currently retreating and have abandoned Anale, Jellogubie, and Gorahei. On the northern front, fighting has almost completely ceased before the arrival of the new Italian Commander-in-Chief, General Badoglio, who is expected to arrive in Massawa today. Meanwhile, a Reuters correspondent in Addis Ababa telegraphed that General Nasibu, the Abyssinian commander in Jijiga, reported by telephone to the Abyssinian Emperor that according to messenger reports, Italian troops had retreated south of Walwal. He added that Abyssinian troops are now engaged in pursuit but have not yet reoccupied the towns of Gorahei and Jellogubie. The Italian troops' hasty retreat is due to the fact that Abyssinian General Tafari's army of 20,000 men has crossed the desert and is advancing towards Dolo, threatening the Italian left flank. It should be noted that the town of Dolo is located at the junction of the Italian Somaliland and British Kenya borders. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Wellington, New Zealand In today's general election in New Zealand, the National Government led by Prime Minister Forbes and Finance Minister Coates was heavily defeated by the Labor Party. This Labor victory is a first in New Zealand history. The Labor Party not only retained its existing seats but also won many seats in key government districts. The government's defeat was largely due to the newly formed Democratic Party fielding separate candidates, which split the government's forces. Currently, the number of seats won by each party is as follows, excluding seven unknown seats: Labor Party 48 seats, Government 17 seats, Independents 8 seats. The composition of the previous House of Representatives was as follows: Government Party 47 seats, Labor Party 24 seats, Independents 9 seats. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Cairo The Nationalist Party recently issued a declaration criticizing Mamelouk, the leader of the Liberal Constitutionalist Party. Other parties are demanding the restoration of the 1923 Constitution and using it as a common political platform. The Liberal Constitutionalist Party refused to cooperate, which is incorrect. After the declaration was issued, the People's Party, the Liberal Constitutionalist Party, and the Nationalist Party's splinter faction all decided to issue separate declarations to explain each party's position on constitutional issues. It is generally believed that the parties' diverging views will inevitably lead to internal strife, causing general political issues to take a back seat. As for Prime Minister Nessim, although his health is weak, he still intends to continue serving in the central government, believing that the current government must calmly deal with the situation if domestic security is to be maintained and some concessions are to be obtained from Britain. It remains uncertain whether a cabinet crisis will erupt. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e54">On the Eve of the Reopening of the French Parliament; Laval Delivers a Speech on Domestic and Foreign Affairs; Maintaining Economic Balance and Opposing Currency Devaluation; Safeguarding the Republican System and Strictly Controlling Violent Groups; Maintaining Friendly Cooperation with Britain on the Italy-Abyssinia Issue; Emphasizing Good Neighborliness and Consolidating European Peace with Italy <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The French Senate and Chamber of Deputies have ended their recess and will reconvene tomorrow. As is customary before the parliament's resumption, the Prime Minister will deliver a speech outlining the government's views. Therefore, Prime Minister Laval delivered a radio broadcast speech tonight, addressing domestic issues such as financial problems, the franc issue, and the fascist groups issue, as well as foreign affairs such as the Italy-Abyssinia issue and collective security. The speech was quite lengthy, and excerpts are provided below:</p>
<p>Laval first addressed the franc issue, stating that the first thing to be decided when the parliament reconvenes on Thursday is the fate of the franc. "How to maintain economic balance and avoid currency devaluation is the most pressing task. If the parliament opposes this view, it should clearly state so, as the people have the inherent right to understand the situation. Otherwise, if parliamentarians argue endlessly, it will inevitably create a state of uncertainty and fatally damage finances. Therefore, the current plan is to ask the parliament to vote on the financial issues quickly and without delay, or the consequences will be unimaginable."</p>
<p>He then explained the legitimacy of the government's legislative orders, stating that the government has always opposed currency devaluation, as it directly increases the burden on modest and poor families, which is very dangerous. It is particularly inappropriate to implement it today, when the general parliamentary elections are approaching. Therefore, the government is determined to resolutely reject it, said Laval. Laval continued that after the financial issues are resolved, the parliament may discuss the issue of so-called fascist groups, for which the government is also prepared. "Guaranteeing the safety of citizens and safeguarding the republican system are the government's responsibilities. No matter which party or faction, if it wants to abuse its power and replace the authority of the state with the authority of the party, it is not allowed by law. Events such as the Brest and Toulon incidents, and the recent clashes between the Croix-de-Feu and the Popular Front in Limoges, are all violations of the law. If such incidents occur again in the future, the government will cause the groups participating in these incidents to lose their right to freedom. Existing laws, if inadequate, will be supplemented by the government. In any case, the government will ensure that everyone abides by the law before it is over. Everyone knows that I have always loved peace, so I especially hope that peace should start from within the country. Violence, no matter where it comes from, is opposed by me. I dare to tell the people not to disturb themselves unnecessarily, so as not to please the enemies. For example, on November 11th this year, people from both the left and right factions demonstrated separately in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, fellow countrymen confronting each other. What is this if not the seeds of chaos? How can people believe in our great nation if it does not know how to rein itself in? In short, national unity is the only way to save the country."</p>
<p>Laval then discussed the Italy-Abyssinia issue, stating that "international conventions are a major factor in our country's security, so we have an obligation to fulfill the results produced by the conventions. On the one hand, we seek long-term cooperation with Britain, and on the other hand, we always want to find ways to localize the dispute. We have exhausted everything to avoid the expansion of the conflict. Since the beginning of the Italy-Abyssinia conflict, we have always advocated avoiding military sanctions. Measures sufficient to cause a naval blockade and the closure of the Suez Canal have never been considered. The task I have undertaken is very difficult, because on the one hand, I must always maintain friendly cooperation with Britain and show that France abides by the League of Nations covenant, and on the other hand, I must maintain friendship with Italy. The reason why I do not avoid difficulties and mediate between the two is simply to ensure that our country's own interests and peace can be taken care of on both sides. I have been looking for a friendly solution to the Italy-Abyssinia conflict with unwavering perseverance. There is no fault to be found in this attempt, because sanctions are not the only strategy to stop the war. The cooperation between Britain and France should be as close and sincere as possible, even more so than in the past, because what Britain and France jointly seek is nothing more than peace. For the sake of preserving peace, Britain and France are united in thought and deed, without the slightest gap between them. What we hope is that once the opportunity comes, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will change his mind, so that our efforts to mediate the Italy-Abyssinia dispute will not be in vain. The Italy-Abyssinia dispute must find an honorable and just solution, on the one hand respecting the principles of the League of Nations, and on the other hand taking into account Italy's interests. I believe that responsible people around the world will share this sentiment. I believe that the leaders of the Italian government must deeply desire to have Italy rejoin the European peace organization, in which case the work started by the Stresa Front at that time may not be impossible to continue." Finally, Laval talked about collective security, briefly stating that "France has always adhered to the principle of collective security, and in any case," that is, regarding the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, there is absolutely no intention to oppose any country. This has recently been repeatedly stated to German leader Hitler by French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet. In short, we do not abandon any friendship, we respect all constraints, and we strive for cooperation among all countries to jointly consolidate European peace. As for Germany, we especially sincerely hope to establish and develop good neighborly relations of mutual respect, because France, as a strong, vibrant, and peace-loving country, has nothing to fear."

<h3 id="e55">The Fate of the French Cabinet Hinges on Two Current Issues; Fascist Organizations and Financial Issues; Left-Wing Meeting Fails to Reach a Compromise <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today's meeting of left-wing parties failed to reach a compromise on the debate at tomorrow's parliamentary session, giving Laval hope of winning the political storm. Therefore, the stock exchange's sentiment turned strong, and the price of public bonds rose by three-quarters of a pound sterling in half an hour, and the price of francs was also stronger. The left-wing parties will continue to meet tomorrow in an attempt to reach a common ground to overthrow the government. The Radical Party advocates that according to Laval's request, the issue of the franc should be discussed first when the parliament opens tomorrow. If the government can first win the financial debate, it can then deal with the Fascist case with more certainty. At today's meeting of the left-wing parties, someone asked Socialist leader Blum what he would do if the government was overthrown tomorrow. Blum said that he would form a government within two hours that was sure to dissolve all Fascist organizations. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Radical Socialist Party's parliamentary group recently passed a resolution adopting Prime Minister Laval's proposal to first discuss the government's financial policy when the parliament reconvenes, and then immediately continue to discuss the issue of Fascist groups. If this resolution is passed by a majority in the parliament, the political storm can be temporarily eased. However, the parliament has 160 Radical Party members, and the above-mentioned group resolution was only passed by a majority of 28 votes to 20 votes, which is extremely noteworthy. Also, at this morning's State Council meeting, the cabinet members resolutely stated that the government should do everything possible to curb the improper activities of Fascist groups, a move that on the surface is quite sufficient to ease the political tension. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Parliament will meet on Thursday, and this meeting will likely be one of the most important scenes in the history of the Third Republic. The current issue not only concerns the survival of the Laval Cabinet, but also greatly relates to the French democratic system itself. The opinions of the left and right wings in the Parliament on various important domestic and foreign issues are more disparate than before. The biggest points of contention in domestic affairs are approximately three: (1) Dissolving right-wing Fascist organizations, such as the Croix-de-Feu, the French Action, and the Patriotic League, which is not only urgently demanded by the Socialist, Communist, and Popular Front, but also firmly advocated by the most powerful Acute Socialist Party in the Parliament. (2) Laval's cabinet's financial and economic policies, Laval has tried his best to reduce the salaries of government personnel, the pensions of veterans, and administrative expenses, and has achieved the goal of budget balance, but whether it should continue is also a question. (3) The issue of controlling the parliamentary re-election in May next year. As for foreign affairs, although France's current position is very complicated, and its relations with the whole world are very important, observers believe that this is only a secondary issue. The situation of the left and right factions in the parliament: the left seems to be uniting, led by Independent Deputy Henriot or even former left-leaning Prime Minister Paul-Boncour, and using the Fascist organization issue or financial issues as weapons to overthrow Laval. The Socialist Party today has resolved to contact other left-wing organizations to overthrow the current cabinet, so the situation has become more serious. As a result, an unusual force may emerge in the French political circles and seize power. For example, the Croix-de-Feu claims to have 300,000 members. According to the left, the group has received instructions to incite a coup. The biggest difficulty for the current government is the government's civil servants, because they are well-organized and have long been known as "a country within a country," and their political views are quite close to the left wing. Therefore, their power should not be underestimated when the left attacks the government in the future. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) A senior official of the Bank of France told an Associated Press reporter today that there is no reason to panic, and the franc is not in danger of devaluation, and there is no possibility of a financial crisis.

<p>(London) The new parliament opened this afternoon, and Conservative MP FitzRoy was elected as Speaker, his fourth re-election as Speaker. Prime Minister Baldwin, Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons Attlee, and "Father of the House" Lloyd George, former Prime Minister during the European War, all extended their warm congratulations. FitzRoy said in his speech that the reason why the parliamentary system is so noble is that the whole country deeply believes that all public opinions in the country have the opportunity to be expressed fairly and freely. He intends to maintain the freedom of speech that makes the position and reputation of the British Parliament admired by the world. FitzRoy continued that he had repeatedly urged members to be concise in their speeches. A debate is valuable for its concise nature. If it is solely for the purpose of eloquent speeches, it loses the true meaning of the debate. If this continues unchanged, it will reduce the public's interest in parliamentary discussions. After FitzRoy finished his speech, the members were sworn in. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Liberal MPs in the House of Commons met today and elected Sinclair as leader to replace the defeated Samuel. Lloyd George also attended the meeting. According to congressional reporters for various newspapers, Lloyd George and members of the Independent Liberal Party in the previous House of Commons will cooperate with members of the party in the new House of Commons, so the unified Liberal Party can reach 21 seats. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It should be noted that Sinclair is a member elected from northern Scotland. He served as Secretary of State for Scotland in the early days of the MacDonald Cabinet. Later, he disagreed with Conservative cabinet members and resigned together with his party's Interior Minister, Sir Samuel. After Samuel was defeated in the recent House of Commons re-election, he was unable to serve as chairman of the party group. Also, because Lloyd George was humble, Sinclair was elected. As for Lloyd George, for the past five years, he has been the leader of the independent Liberal Party in the opposition. He is now cooperating with the orthodox Liberal Party again, as can be seen from his assuming the chairmanship of the Liberal Party group meeting. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e59">The Inside Story of Yin Rugeng's Establishment of a Puppet Organization: Forcibly Incorporating Yanqing, Xianghe, and Other Counties into the Demilitarized Zone; Seeking Instructions from a Certain Country's Military Attache Regarding Dismissal Orders; Song Zheyuan and Others Return from Tianjin to Beiping to Maintain Order <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Hebei situation has seen much brewing recently. However, due to the authorities' calm approach, the extent of the developments is considerably different from what is reported in Japanese newspapers. However, Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Inspector of the Luantung and Jiyu Districts, claiming his situation was exceptional, issued an absurd circular telegram, far beyond general expectations. Song Zheyuan even telegraphed Yin about this matter, urging him to be cautious and not act rashly. Yin then went to Tianjin to reside, rarely meeting with visiting guests. Initially, it was unexpected that Yin would declare his betrayal of the motherland at midnight on the 25th, establishing the so-called "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee" puppet organization in Tong County, publishing a proclamation to the people, an inaugural declaration, and telegrams to Song, Han, and others. As for this puppet organization, it has nine committee members, with Yin as the puppet chairman. His excuse is that he is breaking away from the central government based on the Tanggu Truce and implementing people's autonomy. The so-called committee members claim to have been elected by the War Zone Autonomy Promotion Association. The puppet committee internally has seven departments: Puppet Foreign Affairs Director Huo Shi, Puppet Civil Affairs Director Zhang Renli, Puppet Secretariat Director Zhang (concurrent), Puppet Finance Director Zhao Congyi, Puppet Construction Director Wang Xiacai, and Puppet Security Director Dong Fengxiang. As for the original counties under the Luantung and Jiyu Districts, the Aoyu District includes Linyu, Funing, Changli, Qian'an, Lulong, Luan County, Leting, and Fengrun, totaling eight counties. The Jiyu District includes Zunhua, Xinglong, Yutian, Pinggu, Miyun, Huairou, Sanhe, Ji County, Shunyi, and Tong County, totaling ten counties. It is rumored that Yin Rugeng is preparing to incorporate neighboring counties of the "War Zone" such as Yanqing, Changping, Xianghe, Baozhi, Ninghe, Wuqing, Anshun, and other seven counties into his jurisdiction. It is evident that Yin's rebellious actions are unrestrained.</p>
<p>When the so-called "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee" puppet organization was established in Tongzhou on the 25th, over thirty foreign reporters were present. Among them, the British and American reporters were the most emotionally charged. Chinese reporters, although maintaining composure, mostly revealed infinite emotion. Japanese reporters, on the other hand, were extremely busy. A portion of them mingled with the Chinese and foreign reporters to listen to Yin's speech, while the majority were in Yin's office, conducting special interviews. After the so-called inauguration ceremony, Yin, accompanied by a Japanese advisor, went to the reception room to meet the reporters, speaking shamelessly, unaware that he himself had become a slave to others. At the time, someone asked Yin why such a grand ceremony had no flags representing the political system, and isn't that strange? Yin replied that it was unnecessary. A certain foreign reporter then sarcastically said in French, "Even bandits have flags, what about your esteemed association?" When Yin spoke about the tasks of the puppet committee, he became carried away and said that he wanted (Yin arbitrarily incorporated the four counties of Changping, Xianghe, Ninghe, and Ningdi, which were close to the "War Zone") to create a district of the Kingly Way Paradise. At this time, someone immediately asked Yin whether the financial resources of the twenty-two counties could achieve satisfactory goals. Yin replied that there are over a thousand "esteemed" counties. When asked what the total area of the twenty-two counties was, Yin was speechless, embarrassedly replying that everyone could check the map. Finally, Yin also said that they were breaking away from party rule, not leaving China, and that everyone should recognize the topic. At this point, the Japanese advisor urged Yin to leave. Chinese and foreign reporters also returned to Beiping.</p>
<p>On the day that Yin and others rebelled in Tongzhou, Tianjin was also suddenly tense. Several hundred drug-addicted vagrants falsely claimed to be representatives of a petition for autonomy. Fortunately, the authorities took effective precautions, and the Japanese did not provide them with support, so the situation was quelled on the same day. During the petition, the drug-addicted vagrants wore yellow uniforms and lotus-leaf hats, looking bizarre and only able to frighten merchants and residents. By evening, when they were disarmed and dismissed, their true colors were revealed, and they were in a miserable state. Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Pingjin Garrison, who was briefly resting in Tianjin, returned to Beiping on the evening of the 25th to take charge. Qin Decun, the mayor of Beiping, and Xiao Zhenying, the chairman of Chahar Province, represented the authorities in informing the press that within the scope of the 29th Army's power, there would be absolutely no problems with local security. Therefore, the people of Beiping are still trending toward stability.</p>
<p>Regarding Hebei diplomacy, recent reports from various sources all confirm that a decision has been made by the central government. The saying that He Yingqin would come north to preside over political affairs had been widely spread a week ago. Since the news of the Executive Yuan's decision today (26th) to specially appoint He as the director of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Office arrived in Beiping, the emotions of all parties have been uplifted, unanimously considering it a gratifying event. Zhu Zheyuan and others, who have been struggling for a month, also indirectly indicated to others that the current situation in the north has hope for smooth development due to He's imminent arrival in the north. Song will assume his new position as Director of the Ji-Cha Pacification Headquarters after He arrives in Beiping. At that time, the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters may be abolished. More than ten important figures in the Beiping education community, including Jiang Menglin, Mei Yi-qi, and Hu Shi, visited Song Zheyuan at his residence in Wuyiku Hutong at 2:00 PM today (26th) due to the current situation, and only left around 6:00 PM. According to Hu Shi's statement to reporters, he considered the meeting with Song to be satisfactory. This shows that all the external rumors are not true. During the conversation, he expressed admiration for Song's spirit of struggling through the difficult situation and said that all rumors could be dispelled without attack. After the Executive Yuan's order to dismiss Yin Rugeng and bring him to justice arrived in Beiping, the traitor Yin made a phone call from Tong County to a certain country's military attache to ask for instructions. A special Japanese train left Shanhaiguan this morning (26th) and stopped briefly in Luan County around 7:00 AM. It did not delay when passing through Tianjin and arrived in Beiping at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Xiao Zhenying, the chairman of Chahar Province, and Qin Decun, the mayor of Beiping, went to Tianjin a few days ago to negotiate with various parties on ways to develop the situation. At 1:30 PM on the 25th, they returned to Beiping from Tianjin by car with Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Pingjin Garrison. They did not stop when passing through Tong County and arrived in Beiping at 5:40 PM. Because Beiping is near Tianjin, and disturbances occurred in Tianjin, the people of Beiping were naturally uneasy. Therefore, security has now been tightened. After Yin Rugeng announced the establishment of the puppet organization, the county magistrates were extremely dissatisfied with Yin and returned to Baoding one after another. The magistrates of Linyu and Leting counties have arrived in Baoding to ask for instructions from the provincial government. The Hebei Provincial Government is quite calm about this incident, believing that it has no significant impact on the overall situation in North China. In addition to telegraphing the central government for instructions, it has ordered the county magistrates and security brigade commanders to fulfill their duties and do their best to maintain local security.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Committee, the ambassadors, ministers, and charge d'affaires of various countries in China telegraphed their respective countries to report the truth. After receiving the telegrams from Yin Rugeng and others, the central government repeatedly telegraphed Beiping to inquire about the process. The Beiping authorities are fully responsible for security. However, tonight (26th) at 9:00 PM, trams were taken off the tracks early, and the military police began inspecting pedestrians at 10:00 PM. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Tianjin Once Experienced Disturbances: Those Claiming to Be Representatives of the People Petitioned, Occupied the Lecture Hall, and Formed a Suicide Squad <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Rumors have been rife here since January, and society has been uneasy. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd, those claiming to be so-called citizen representatives attempted to hold a meeting but failed. However, four people went directly to the municipal government to petition, demanding that Mayor Cheng Ke return power to the people and implement autonomy. On the 24th, five-color leaflets were found distributed in the thoroughfares. On the same day, the so-called "Puan Association" posted slogans and declarations, the wording of which was nothing more than Japan-Manchuria-China united, realizing Greater Asianism, and uniting the members of the National Anqing Gang. That night, it was rumored that plainclothes teams would depart from a certain place, wearing police uniforms, numbering over a thousand people. The Public Security Bureau, upon learning of this, temporarily ordered the police on duty in each district to wear summer police hats so that they could be easily identified when action was taken. Security was maintained throughout the night, so it was passed safely. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 AM on the 25th, more than ten trucks suddenly drove out of a certain concession, with red and white cloth banners hanging all over the trucks. The trucks carried over a hundred people wearing grass-green uniforms, yellow soft hats, red five-pointed star badges, short wooden sticks, and dry food bags and kettles. They also carried two portable machine guns and two machine guns. They drove to the First Popular Lecture Hall on Dongma Road, smashed open the door, and all entered. They immediately hung red cloth outside the door, with the words "North China People's Self-Defense Corps Suicide Squad" written on it. There was also white cloth with the words "North China People's Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" written on it. Machine guns were set up in the thoroughfare. Soon, over two hundred people in plainclothes, with cloth badges of the fake North China People's Self-Defense Corps wrapped around their arms and holding cloth flags with slogans, also arrived at the hall to gather. Protected by those in uniform, they boarded more than ten trucks, led by a certain foreigner in a car, and traveled along Dahu Tong to Jingang Bridge. Several people in uniform jumped down first and went to the east and west yamen of the Tianjin-Gugu Security Headquarters, standing like guards. The rest rushed to the New Railway Station along Dajing Road, parading and demonstrating along the way, shouting slogans. After getting off at the New Railway Station, the people were divided into several groups. The first group, about twenty people in uniform and forty in plainclothes, took two cars directly to the municipal government on Yuewei Road, demanding to see the mayor. Mayor Cheng Ke had not yet arrived. Secretary-General Sun Runyu rushed from his residence upon hearing the report. It was 8:40 AM. When asked about their intentions, over twenty people in plainclothes and eight in uniform entered and claimed to Sun that they had come to petition for autonomy and return power to the people. When asked about the names of their group and representatives, they replied that they were the North China People's Self-Help Corps, and the representatives were Wu Meixiang, Wu Wenru, and Wang Zhupo. Sun agreed to convey their intentions to the mayor. At this time, another group of about a hundred people in plainclothes also came to petition. The municipal government sent people to persuade them to leave. However, the eight people in uniform refused to leave the municipal government's reception room. Sun telegraphed Ikeshang, the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie, to come with two gendarmes to help drive them away. At around 10:00 AM, the so-called Cangxian People's Self-Defense Corps, all in plainclothes, numbering about a hundred people, continued to arrive at the municipal government. Sun sent someone to meet with them. The petitioners refused to send representatives inside. The Security Department had no choice but to send out special armed forces to guard the area, dragging six of their leaders inside. Wang Xinggang interrogated them about their intentions. The six people cried for help. The soldiers were extremely angry and surrounded Wang, asking the adjutant to punish these people. Wang then telephoned Shang Zhen in Baoding to ask for instructions. He received a reply, instructing him to handle it properly immediately. Ikeshang, the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie, also received the news and demanded the release of the six people by telephone. After the release, the petitioners gathered outside the door and dispersed. However, dozens of members of the suicide squad occupying the lecture hall refused to retreat, displaying six or seven large trucks on the street and distributing leaflets, which were signed "North China Autonomy Petition Group," "Wang Ming, Commander of the North China Self-Defense Corps," and "Tian Zhiping, Captain of the North China People's Self-Defense Corps Suicide Squad." The police were unable to stop them. Mayor Cheng Ke and Public Security Bureau Chief Liu Yushu contacted various parties from morning to afternoon and met with Tada, the commander of the Japanese army, Ohyan, the newly established head of the Kwantung Army's Tianjin special service agency, and Doihara, asking them to assist in resolving the situation with the maintenance of security in mind. By 5:00 PM, they obtained the consent of the Japanese side, and several gendarmes were dispatched to assist the special service team and the personnel of the First Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau to go to the lecture hall to persuade the so-called suicide squad captain to leave. The members of the team were all recruited temporarily, unkempt and with long hair. They occupied the lecture hall and prepared their own cooking utensils, roasting steamed buns with pickles and eating heartily. When someone entered and asked who their leader was, they replied that they did not know. When asked what they planned to do, they replied that they were following orders. When asked anything else, they were completely ignorant. When they were persuaded to leave, most of them took off their uniforms and scattered quietly. The people who claimed to be the petition group were mostly servants hired from various pawnshops to carry ceremonial weapons, paid four cents a day. From 10:00 PM on the 25th, the entire city was under martial law, and no one was allowed to pass through. As of the 26th, it was still under heavy guard. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Songjiang: Red Cross Telegraphed Province Requesting Ban on Quarrying <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xuewen, the chairman of the Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross, stated that the Jiufeng Mountains in Songjiang Prefecture are natural scenic spots and historical sites, especially with many tombs of famous figures from past dynasties, as recorded in local chronicles. Since the national government established its capital, local ruffians, driven by greed, have used afforestation and land reclamation as pretexts to fraudulently obtain mountain land licenses, actually implementing their scheme to destroy graves and exhume tombs for profit. Skeletal remains are scattered, a tragic sight to behold. Recently, due to the imperfect organization of factories, the various quarrying factories have successively closed down, and the unemployed workers are suffering from hunger and cold. Moreover, many are immigrants, making it easy to cause trouble. For the sake of local security, it is especially important to repatriate them early. The Red Cross has telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, requesting that the aforementioned workers be repatriated immediately and consulting the Ministries of Railways and Communications to issue passports and provide free transportation. It also hopes that the county will be ordered to ban the illegal quarrying of the Jiufeng Mountains. The Provincial Department has now approved the instructions, stating that the telegram has been received, and the county should be ordered to strictly enforce the ban and consult with the Ministries of Communications and Railways for investigation and handling.</p>

The registration period is about to end, and the number of registered public prostitutes is as follows: over twenty first-class prostitutes, over two hundred and forty second-class prostitutes, and over fifty third-class prostitutes. Several dozen of the second-class prostitutes have come to Suzhou from Changshu, Shengze, and other places to join. There are also several dozen variant prostitutes, the Minsheng singing girls, who should register as first-class, but because they do not want to sell their bodies, they have not yet registered. Next month, syphilis examinations will be conducted on the prostitutes, and prostitution licenses will be issued. The official opening will be on New Year's Day next year.</p>

Unexpectedly, when he reached the Magou Shang area, a robber wearing a woolen coat and a duckbill hat, holding a box gun, shouted for him to stop. Axi pleaded with him, saying that all his silver dollars had been used to pay taxes. The robber did not believe him and forcibly searched him. Axi resisted, and the robber shot him in the left hand. Neighbors reported to the nearby security team, who rushed to pursue and arrest the perpetrator. Axi, who was injured, was carried to the Wujin Hospital in the city the next day. Fortunately, the injury was minor and should not be a major problem.</p>

<p>Wei Maotou, a resident of Xiaoshan Chengxi, is a lacquer worker. His son, Jinmin, does not engage in honest work and treats gambling and prostitution as his life. Father and son are like strangers. Unexpectedly, on the 25th, due to gambling losses, he asked his father for money to pay off his gambling debts. Because his father said he had financial difficulties, the ungrateful son violently threw rice bowls and long stools at his father's head, causing blood to flow like a river and inflicting serious injuries to his waist, causing him to faint. He was immediately helped up by others, and he sued the local court's procuratorate. The court ordered the First Public Security Bureau to arrest the ungrateful son and punish him severely as a warning to others.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Concrete Beauty <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>When listening to people speak, concrete, trivial, and simple statements often sound more pleasing than abstract, grand, and profound ones. Let me first give a most obvious example: saying "the problem of livelihood" is not as pleasing as saying "the problem of clothing and food"; saying "the problem of clothing and food" is not as pleasing as saying "the problem of rice bowls" or "the problem of bread." Because the word "livelihood" encompasses everything comprehensively, it is too abstract, too grand, and too profound, so listeners do not gain a deep understanding, a strong impression, or a strong interest from it. If you change it to the three words "clothing and food," because it is more concrete, more trivial, and more simple, listeners find it easier to understand, the impression is strong and clear, and it is full of interest and can be grasped. Sometimes, speakers even feel that the words "clothing and food" are too broad, so they go a step further and use the words "rice bowl" or "bread." These are the most common and familiar objects to everyone, and who doesn't immediately gain a personal interest, a strong impression, and a full understanding when they hear them? Therefore, "unemployment" is often translated as "smashing the rice bowl"; "loss of land" is also translated as "changing the color of the map," making listeners shocked.</p>
<p>I now call this speaking technique "concrete beauty." This is also one of the rhetorical devices after the progress of human language, similar to the "metaphor" I discussed earlier (the article was published in a certain issue of a literary magazine this year), but there are differences: metaphor also uses concrete things to help reason; however, the concrete object taken has no relationship with reasoning itself, only the same nature. For example, "Why use an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken?" This matter has nothing to do with Confucius's way of governing, only the nature of "using great talent for a small task" is the same, so it is cited as a metaphor to make reasoning concrete and interesting, and easier to listen to. The "concrete beauty" discussed now is different: the concrete object taken must have a close relationship with reasoning, so that listeners can see the big in the small and the whole in the part. For example, "rice bowl" or "bread" has a close relationship with "livelihood," and is the most important part or core of "livelihood." Therefore, the speaker only needs to give this one corner, and the listeners can infer three, ten, a hundred, or a thousand. The so-called "rice bowl" actually includes everything edible, such as old wine, cigarettes, and lighters. I think this language technique is most meaningful, especially when listening to lectures and reading papers. A long and broad abstract principle often makes people headache or sleepy. On the contrary, if you make good use of metaphors and this kind of concrete beauty, listeners will not feel tired; if you make good use of it, a few words can be worth tens of thousands of words. The speeches of those who advised, such as Chun Yukun and Dongfang Shuo, and the speeches of poets can be said to be examples of this.</p>
<p>There are countless examples of this kind of concrete beauty in our daily language and in poetry. For the convenience of savoring, I will excerpt a few that I can think of below, but this is just one corner.</p>
<p>Throwing down the pen, volunteering for service, removing armor, dismounting, resigning from office, ascending the throne, dusting off one's hat, binding one's hair, washing one's ears, wiping one's eyes, retiring from office, mourning for the dead, shaving one's head, making a living, sweeping the couch, holding the bull's ear, seizing the championship banner, holding the teaching whip, following in the footsteps, sleeping soundly, living freely in the forest, bowing down under the skirt, fighting to offer clogs,...</p>
<p>Literally speaking, most of these words don't make sense. Do scholars hold pens day and night? Do warriors never remove their armor day and night? Those who abandon their official positions often live in concessions, why resign from office? Does any leader hold a bull's ear in his hand? However, this is where the interest of concrete beauty lies. Some of them rely on the help of classics or are close to metaphors. But the principle is always to see the big in the small and the whole in the part. There are also many good examples of this in colloquial language. The mouths of those who are good at speaking often reveal them. They don't say "a certain family has no food to eat," they say "the bottom of a certain family's pot is facing the sky." They don't say "a certain person can be famous in later generations," they say "a certain person will eat cold leftovers." Chuan Baicun said that the women's problem is the problem of "stomach and uterus." Wu Zhihui said that love is "sperm acting strangely." Although the language is harsh, it is pleasing to hear. It can be said to have exhausted the ability to concretize language. Unfortunately, my knowledge is too narrow and my memory is too bad to think of more examples for a while. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Three Organizations Telegraph for the Suppression of the Hebei-East Rebels, Requesting He Yingqin to Immediately Go North to Be Stationed in Tianjin and Beijing, Declaring Opposition to Any Autonomous Organization in North China <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Citizen's Federation of the First Special District of this city and the Chinese General Federation of Industry telegraphed to the central government and the generals of North China yesterday, requesting the suppression of the pseudo-Hebei-East Anti-Communist Autonomous Council. The United Federation of Universities telegraphed to the authorities in Beijing and North China yesterday, requesting a quick punishment and suppression, and telegraphed to the authorities of various countries, declaring the meaning of opposition. The following is an excerpt of the original text.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Central Government: The City Federation telegraphed to the Central Government, saying: Nanjing Central Executive Committee, National Government Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Committee, [all recipients] Jian, Yin Rugeng, used by others, dared to lead twenty-two counties in Hebei-East to establish the so-called Hebei-East Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee in Tong County, using the pretext of public opinion to destroy the integrity of our country's territory. The news spread, and we were deeply indignant. We believe that Yin is the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Ji-Mi District, and should do his best to be loyal and jointly defend the country. Unexpectedly, he did not think about this plan, but colluded with traitors, served as a pawn, and was so insane. Fortunately, our central government has insight into the traitorous situation and has clearly ordered his dismissal and arrest, upholding justice and saving the people from fire and water. Now, the people of Hebei-East urgently hope that our central government will send senior officials to comfort them and quell the chaos. We hereby telegraph, please forward to He Yingqin, the Chief of the Executive Yuan's Office in Beiping, to go north immediately to be stationed in Tianjin and Beijing, and lay the foundation for the country. We are extremely eager to receive this, (2) The Chinese General Federation of Industry telegraphed to the Central Government, saying: Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Committee, [all recipients] Jian, In recent years, the situation of our China has been subjected to strong pressure from outside and harassment by traitors from within. Sometimes, they do not hesitate to sacrifice national honor to please foreigners and become puppets, which is extremely insane. Now, the past painful experiences have not been resolved, and the disaster in Hebei-East has come again. This is truly a major national crisis. All of our people should unanimously support national rights and cannot sell out in the slightest. Our association has read the clear orders of your government and the Executive Yuan regarding the recent Hebei-East autonomy issue, and has taken emergency steps. However, the handling of the incident should be quick and not slow. A slight hesitation may lead to further complications. Moreover, Hebei-East is the gateway to North China, and its market is especially important for the production life of the southeastern provinces. If the territory is divided, not only will the situation in the southeast be affected, but also national taxes and domestic economy will be affected. Past facts can be taken as a warning. We hereby request that your government and the Executive Yuan immediately order He, the Chief of Office, to take office quickly, and also issue clear orders to the local generals to be responsible for suppressing the rebels, stabilizing the overall situation, and securing the territory. We telegraph urgently, and respectfully ask for your consideration. The Chinese General Federation of Industry gratefully thanks you.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Generals: (1) The City Federation telegraphed to the Generals of North China, saying: Commander Song of the Beiping Garrison, Chairman of Hebei Province, Chairman Han of Shandong Province, Mayor Cheng of Tianjin, [all recipients] Jian, Yin Rugeng organized the Hebei-East Autonomous Anti-Communist Committee in Tongzhou on [a certain day], declaring independence, betraying the country, and destroying the integrity of our territory. The people of the whole country have risen up to demand suppression. You are loyal and patriotic, and stationed in North China. At this time of crisis, you have the responsibility to protect the border. We urge you to uphold justice, quickly send elite troops, and issue clear orders to suppress, correct the people's views, and defend the nation forever. We telegraph and report, and wait for your instructions, (2) The Chinese General Federation of Industry telegraphed: Commander Song of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, Chairman Shang of the Baoding Provincial Government, Chairman Han of the Jinan Provincial Government, according to reports, Hebei-East has declared autonomy and seceded from the central government. The people of the whole country are deeply indignant at this insane and absurd action. You are loyal and patriotic, and we have long admired you. We hope that you will decisively eliminate the rebels, so as to uphold the national law and stabilize the country. We are eager to await your orders. The Chinese General Federation of Industry gratefully thanks you.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Authorities: The United Federation of Universities in Shanghai held an executive committee meeting again at 3 pm yesterday. Ou Yuanhuai of Daxia University, Cao Liangxia of Datong University, Liu Zhanen of Hujiang University, Li Denghui of Fudan University, Weng Zhilong of Tongji University, Zhu Gongjin of Guanghua University, Hu Duanxing and Ke Chengmao of Jiaotong University, etc., discussed and decided to issue a telegram on the Luan-East incident (the telegram text is recorded later), and sent a telegram to the authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Japan, and Germany, declaring the intention of the people of our country to firmly oppose any autonomous organization in North China. The following is the original text of the telegram: Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Committee, Acting President Kong of the Executive Yuan, Administrative Officer He of the Executive Yuan's Office in Beiping, Director Song of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office, Chairman Shang of the Hebei Provincial Government, Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government, Chairman Xiao of the Chahar Provincial Government, Mayor Qin of Beiping, Mayor Cheng of Tianjin, [all recipients] Jian, Yin Rugeng, under the guise of autonomy, seized Hebei-East and issued a declaration, seceding from the central government. The traces of rebellion are already obvious. As an official appointed by the government, he holds the heavy responsibility entrusted by the country, and yet he takes such insane actions. Anyone with blood and energy will be indignant. This is intolerable. Our central government has the responsibility to maintain the integrity of the territory and administration, and should quickly punish and suppress it to curb the chaos and uphold the national law. Do not hesitate, and then let it rest, resulting in the忌of投鼠and贻滋蔓of worry. The military and political chiefs of our provinces have the mission of guarding and defending the country. At this critical moment of national survival, the only way to resist humiliation and save the country is to strictly abide by the central government's intentions, unite sincerely, and thoroughly unify. All heresies and conspiracies that can alienate the connection between the central government and the local governments are deeply hated by the people of the whole country and will be abandoned together. Our friendly countries should also know that the Republic of China is a sovereign, independent, and territorially integral country. No division is allowed under any circumstances. Anyone who secedes from the central government is a criminal who destroys sovereignty and endangers the country. Our government has the power to punish them. This is purely an internal affair. Anyone who obstructs it in secret or interferes arbitrarily is a manifestation of aggression by force. The people of our country will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to firmly oppose it. We hereby announce, and hope that you will consider it. The United Federation of Universities in Shanghai thanks you.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, in addition to receiving Chu Minyi and Zeng Zhongming to hear reports on central government affairs yesterday morning, President Wang also invited Drs. Niu Huisheng and Noel for consultation at about 9:30 am, which lasted until noon. According to the doctors, the wound on the left cheek has now completely healed, and the gauze applied has also been removed this morning (ie yesterday morning). It is also heard that electrical massage will be started within a few days, because since the injury, due to the relationship between nerves and muscles, the upper and lower jaws cannot be opened and closed freely, which is inconvenient not only for speaking, but also for eating only liquids and soft foods, so electrical massage is needed to restore the muscles as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Heavy Snow in Zhengzhou Yesterday, Eurasia Aircraft Delayed in Xi'an, Blindly Took Off from Chengdu in the Morning, Encountered Clouds on the Way and Avoided Danger <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong She, the second giant aircraft of the Eurasia Airlines Junkers 52 type, No. 52, was scheduled to travel eastward yesterday (Wednesday), but the weather in Shaanxi and Sichuan changed drastically yesterday. However, in order to ensure the accuracy of the schedule, Eurasia Airlines still took off as usual. It took off from Chengdu at 8 am at the risk of its flight, but unexpectedly, at about 10 am, it encountered dark clouds and the weather was extremely dull in the Qinling Mountains, where Chengdu and Xi'an meet. The aircraft flew blindly in the clouds and continued to move forward. Finally, at 10:30 am, it emerged from the clouds and avoided danger, and landed safely in Xi'an at 11 am. The aircraft originally planned to fly to Shanghai again, but because of the heavy snow in the Zhengzhou area, it stayed in Shaanxi and waited for the weather to improve today before returning to Shanghai. A spokesman for the company told a reporter from Huadong She yesterday that the aircraft telegraphed the company in Shanghai, saying that during the flight this morning (ie yesterday morning), it was blocked by dense clouds at all times. Fortunately, the aircraft was equipped with blind flight instruments, so it was able to ascend upwards, enter the clouds directly, and continue to move forward in the absence of any targets, so it could safely fly to its destination in Xi'an over the high mountains covered by clouds. This is said to be the first successful adventure of Chinese civil aviation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee decided to allocate 3 million yuan from the credit small loan item as a fund for the acceptance and discount of industrial and commercial bills, and sent letters to the bank and Qian industry associations to solicit opinions. The Qian industry association has now approved the principle and will first handle Type A, that is, raw materials and goods are stored in warehouses. Those that have been identified as needed and valuable in the market can fill out bank acceptance bills according to the prescribed discount, and the trustee bank or firm will accept them. Type B will be postponed, that is, commercial acceptance bills obtained from the sale of goods can be applied for discount to the trustee bank or firm. If the persons related to the above bills are found to have considerable assets, they can be exempted from providing guarantees. The Banking Association has set up a small committee to study the matter. A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from the banking industry yesterday that the members of the small committee, such as Luo Qinghua, have begun to study the matter. After a decision is made, they will report to the association. As for the rediscount case, the Central Bank has agreed to handle it and is now preparing the method by the Business Bureau.</p>

<p>The municipal government has gradually completed various important buildings in the central area of the city in recent years. The Zhabei area is located between the public concession and the central area of the city, and its location is extremely important. Therefore, the main roads in Zhabei have been gradually completed, making the traffic in the area more and more convenient. Therefore, the market in Zhabei has gradually recovered to the state before the January 28th Incident. However, after the Douleau'an Road Incident, some residents disturbed each other and moved out one after another. The municipal authorities, concerned about the people's situation, have been able to make the residents in the area move back one after another. Now, the municipal government continues the previous aim of prospering the market situation in Zhabei and strives to promote it, and also pays attention to maintaining public security. According to the municipal government, the financial resources spent by the government on the reconstruction work in the Zhabei area since the January 28th Incident are no less than ten million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Eurasia Aviation Corporation Sends Personnel to Study in Germany; Second Group of Seven to Depart Early Next Month; Li Jing Discusses the Cultivation of Talent <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation has consistently dispatched personnel to various countries over the years to study aviation and mechanical techniques. It is learned that this year's group includes He Shou-rong, Lin Qing-dai, Rong Guan-dui, Chen Feng-qi, Zhang Yan-tang, Yang Bao-fan, and Feng Shi-jing, a total of seven individuals. Their passports have all been processed, and they will depart early next month. A reporter from the Central News Agency, upon learning of this, visited Mr. Li Jing-cong, the company's general manager, yesterday. According to Mr. Li (hereinafter Li's remarks), although civil aviation in our country has made considerable progress in recent years, the technical aspects still require assistance from foreign personnel. While these foreign personnel have the responsibility of teaching domestic technicians, they often prefer to use apprentices because of their familiarity with the techniques, ease of management, and lack of effort required. Therefore, they often advocate for hiring craftsmen as a principle. I believe that while hiring craftsmen is indeed useful, most have not received formal education. To expect them to contribute to the development of the national aviation industry or shoulder responsibility in the future based on their experience is unlikely. Therefore, since becoming the general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, I have strived to overcome the prejudice of foreign personnel and, in addition to craftsmen, have diligently worked to cultivate advanced domestic technicians both at home and abroad. For the past three years, we have consistently trained personnel based on this policy. Those recruited are graduates of domestic and foreign mechanical schools, high schools, or aviation academies. Currently, there are over forty successfully trained mechanics serving at various stations along the line, as well as at the two repair factories in Beiping Nanyuan and Shanghai Longhua. There are also four assigned to aircraft for flight duties and six serving as on-board mechanics and communications personnel, all of whom have received blind flight training. These mechanics and flight personnel are technically no less skilled than foreign flight and mechanical personnel. As for sending them abroad for further study, it is aimed at pursuing deeper knowledge to catch up quickly. This is because our country's current equipment, in all aspects, is still far behind others. Eurasia Aviation Corporation sent five people to study in Germany the autumn before last, including Zhou Zhao-lin, Chen Zhao-wei, Fang Wen-ji, Fan Jing-lan, and Hu Hui-jian. Most of them have successfully completed their studies and will soon be ordered to return home for employment. This is the second group being sent, including Feng Shi-jing, Chen Feng-qi, He Shou-rong, Rong Guan-dui, Lin Qing-dai, Zhang Yan-tang, and Yang Bao-fan, a total of seven individuals. They have all received one to three years of training at Eurasia Aviation Corporation. Not only is their technical skill reliable, but their character is also excellent. The physical condition of He Shou-rong, Chen Feng-qi, Lin Qing-dai, and Rong Guan-dui, who are studying flight, has been examined by the German doctor Knoll and deemed satisfactory and qualified. The study period is approximately two to three years. Zhang Yan-tang, Feng Shi-jing, and Yang Bao-fan are going to study mechanics or materials management, for a period of approximately one year or more. The practice of sending personnel abroad for study will continue annually to ensure the continuous training of domestic flight and mechanical personnel, preventing any interruption or a feeling of insufficient supply in the future. Eurasia Aviation Corporation has also sent letters to various industrial universities, requesting them to recommend graduates of engineering departments with excellent academic records, character, and integrity for trial employment. The best candidates will be selected for thorough training. In the future, if Chinese individuals or companies wish to establish domestic aviation routes, I am very willing to select several individuals from among the already trained domestic flight and mechanical personnel who are knowledgeable, experienced, and persevering, and recommend them for their service, to jointly develop the aviation industry. As for the members of this group being sent, their luggage and passports have been processed. I will fly to Beijing this afternoon to accompany them to meet with Minister Zhu and Vice Ministers Yu and Zhang of the Ministry of Transportation, to personally request instructions before departing early next month.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Telegraph Bureau; Smooth Telephone Telegraph Service; Over Seven Hundred Telegrams Sent in the Last Five Days; Trial Operation Increases Business by Over One-Fifth <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, recognizing that in the past, after 6:00 PM, there were only two places in the city to send telegrams: the bureau's main office and the radio receiving station on Minguo Road. Given the vast area of the city, having only two locations to send telegrams caused inconvenience for those who lived far from these locations and needed to send urgent telegrams. Therefore, starting on the evening of the 22nd, a method of sending telegrams by telephone was implemented on a trial basis for a period of three months. As of yesterday (the 26th), the trial had been in effect for five days. According to Mr. Xu Bao-hua of the bureau, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency yesterday morning, the bureau's purpose in trying this method was to reduce the difficulty and obstacles for citizens sending telegrams. The method of sending telegrams by telephone is as follows: citizens with telephones at home who need to send a telegram after 6:00 PM can immediately notify the bureau's main office by telephone (telephone number 13082). They can report the desired message over the phone, and the bureau's staff will immediately record it. They will then call back to confirm with the sender that the message is correct and send it immediately, quickly and efficiently. As for the telegraph fee, the bureau's staff will calculate it based on the number of words and issue a receipt, sending someone to the sender's home the next morning to collect the fee, saving trouble and avoiding the inconvenience of sending someone to collect the fee at night. Since the implementation on the evening of the 22nd, over seven hundred telegrams have been sent as of yesterday, which is more enthusiastic than expected. Therefore, it is predicted that after a month of trial operation, business will increase by more than one-fifth. After three months of trial operation, there will be even better results, and the bureau will officially adopt this method. The telephone telegraph service will be available from 6:00 PM to 7:00 AM every night, and all day on Sundays.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Music Benefit to Be Held at the End of the Month <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Flood Relief Association has been appealing to all parties for donations to aid in disaster relief. Winter is approaching, and the victims are in urgent need of assistance. Fortunately, people from all walks of life have been enthusiastic and supportive, resulting in significant contributions. However, the disaster area is vast, and the situation is dire. Without actively raising substantial funds, it is difficult to provide widespread assistance. Therefore, the fundraising group of the association has decided on several plans to increase income for relief efforts. The progress has been reported in previous issues. It is learned that the Music Benefit Concert, co-organized by the association and the China Harmonica Society, is scheduled to be held at the YMCA Auditorium on Sichuan Road at 8:00 PM on the 30th of this month and at 3:00 PM on December 1st. The program is also very exciting. In addition to over thirty members of the China Harmonica Society's male and female basic team, there will be solo performances by Mr. Chen Neng-fang, piano performances by Ms. Ma Xu-ruo, violin performances by Mr.狄克, and xylophone performances by Mr. 岩井. Tickets are available at various music stores, bookstores, schools, and the fundraising group's temporary office on the third floor of the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao. It is hoped that all sectors will purchase tickets as soon as possible to avoid overcrowding. The soy sauce promotion for disaster relief, conducted jointly with the China Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing Factory, has been in effect for many days, and purchases have been very enthusiastic. Since the factory's purpose is purely for disaster relief and not for business purposes, this method is without waste, and all sectors should be happy to purchase. The previous fundraising drive by the Boy Scouts and the soccer benefit chrysanthemum amusement park event have been closed for many days. The results of the income have been published successively. However, the detailed numbers, in the Boy Scout category, have not yet been fully submitted by nine groups. The funds from the soccer and chrysanthemum relief event have not been submitted on time. It is heard that the association has sent out many reminder letters. Enthusiastic people from all walks of life should submit these funds as soon as possible so that the association can compile and announce them and distribute them to the disaster area as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The relief request telegram from Guanyun County reads: The breach of the Yellow River has affected Guanyun County in northern Jiangsu, which is located downstream and has suffered particularly severe disasters. Since the successive breaches of the Liu Tang, Chai Mi, Wan Gong, Ding Dang, and other rivers, the affected area has reached over thirty townships. The water depth on the plains is four to eight feet, and people and livestock have been washed away, with villages turned into ruins. The number of victims is estimated to be over one hundred thousand, which is an unprecedented disaster in decades. With the approaching cold weather and lack of food and clothing, they will inevitably face the tragic fate of wandering in ditches and ravines. Xuechen and others are heartbroken by what they have witnessed and are filled with endless worries. In addition to making desperate appeals to various places, we have always admired your empathy for suffering and your concern for the hungry and drowning. We humbly request your great compassion and generous benevolence in promptly allocating relief funds, the more the better, so that everyone can receive grace and implement relief as soon as possible, thereby saving many lives.

<h3 id="e97">Loading and Unloading Workers at the Two Railway North Freight Stations; Managed by the Railway Administration; Originally Handled by the Loading and Unloading Workers Cooperative, Resulting in Repeated Disputes; Now Managed by the Traffic Department, Resulting in Increased Wages for the Workers <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The loading and unloading work at the North Freight Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was originally handled by the North Loading and Unloading Workers Cooperative. However, due to workers competing for work and other reasons, there were repeated disturbances and occasional械鬥incidents, which greatly affected transportation and security. In order to improve work efficiency and enhance worker welfare, the Ministry of Railways specifically ordered the railway to be directly managed by the Traffic Department, which has been implemented since the 16th of last month. It is heard that since the railway's Traffic Department took over the operation, it has conducted worker registration, assigned administrators, and strictly formulated management regulations, and the operation has been very smooth. It has also been determined that all loading and unloading fees, except for 10% to be set aside as a public welfare fund for worker welfare and incentives, will be distributed equally to the workers. The salaries of the administrators are also paid by the railway. According to investigations, the half-month salary for October has been issued by the department, with each person receiving 21 yuan and 98 fen. It is estimated that each person can earn around 50 yuan per month, which is a significant increase from the previous 10 yuan per month. The workers are all satisfied.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Music Committee held a meeting on the 20th of this month. The conductor of the orchestra reported that since the beginning of this season's concerts, the second popular music concert had the largest audience. This shows that light music is popular with the masses. Therefore, he advocated that symphonic music concerts and popular music concerts should continue to be held alternately this year. The Director of Finance stated that although there were more listeners at light music concerts, ticket revenue did not increase due to lower ticket prices. However, he did not object to the conductor's proposal. As a result, the Music Committee passed the motion that symphonic music concerts and popular music concerts should be held alternately within this year according to the conductor's proposal, and recommended that the board of directors approve it. In addition, Mr. Ohi, a Japanese member of the Music Committee, had previously found a way to have the Municipal Council Orchestra perform at a歌舞技座 on North Sichuan Road for the convenience of Japanese children, and the results were good. Therefore, the Music Committee expressed its gratitude for Mr. Ohi's efforts.</p>

<p>Over a thousand fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai International Settlement, opposing the hidden increase in transportation fees by the four slaughterhouse companies of Su, Xi, Ren, Yuan, Ninghai, and Ninghu, convened a general meeting of industry representatives a few days ago.

<h3 id="e100">Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry: Proposal to Discuss Dyeing Prices at Meeting <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association has recently been affected by the continuous increase in the price of dyes, exceeding 25%. Dyes are the main raw material for the dyeing industry. Recently, the dye industry has adopted cash transactions, and prices have risen without available goods, hindering the source of supply and causing panic. The standard dyeing price has always been determined based on the rise and fall of dye prices. Usually, dyeing prices are settled with silk merchants. However, some brokers, in order to secure business, accommodate the situation and slightly deviate from the dyeing price agreed upon by the competent authorities. The dyeing industry requires dyes, coal, and technicians, resulting in high costs. As a result, the dyeing price is often insufficient to cover the material costs and expenses. Many companies have suffered losses and gone bankrupt as a result. Even those with strong capital are struggling in this unfavorable economic situation, feeling exhausted. Now that the government has implemented the legal tender policy, the economy has changed, and various industries are raising prices to adapt to the economic environment and make up for losses. The association once convened a meeting to discuss pricing plans and assigned personnel to negotiate. The sub-committee has now made three recommendations: (1) "The dyeing price standard should be increased by 25% based on the original dyeing price settled with the silk merchants by each industry, and all should comply." (2) "The implementation measures for the proposed price increase should be created in the form of a price list and reported to the competent authorities for record. If any industry intentionally raises prices or secretly lowers the price standard, once the facts are verified, severe punishment should be requested from the association in accordance with Municipal Government Orders No. 161 and 162." (3) "The length of silk and satin should be restricted. The measurement should be based on the municipal foot of the metric system, and each piece should not exceed fifty feet. If the length exceeds the limit, the dyeing price should be calculated proportionally per foot to facilitate work and improve the quality of dyeing." It is reported that the aforementioned recommendations will be presented for discussion at the general meeting today.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Tianchan Stage Managed by Gu Zhuxuan Suddenly Suspended Performances: The Reason is the Small Commission Payment Issue, Currently Being Mediated, Expected to Resume Performances <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, Tianchan Stage, managed by Gu Zhuxuan, suddenly suspended performances for the past two days. The main reason is a dispute over small commission payments. Mediation is currently underway, and performances are expected to resume within days. The general audience, unaware of the reason, still numbered in the thousands yesterday, and the reporter has investigated the details as follows:</p>
<p>Ten Years of History Since Opening: Tianchan Stage is located at the corner of Yunnan Road on the Fourth Avenue of this port. It was founded by Gu Zhuxuan, who was recently involved in the case of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World. It has been open for nearly ten years. Business was quite dull before. The January 28th Incident caused it to suspend performances for two months. After resuming performances, business flourished, especially when the Fu Liancheng Troupe visited Shanghai. This summer, famous actors such as Zhao Ruquan, Bai Yukun, Bu Yunfang, Zhao Junyu, Yang Dingnong, Liu Kunrong, and Wang Fuying were hired, and the entire Legend of Jigong was newly arranged. Business became increasingly prosperous, with almost every day sold out.</p>
<p>Gu's Case Occurred, Lack of Funds: Two months ago, Gu was arrested by the French police for his involvement in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. After the case occurred, the theater's finances became strained. Although efforts were made to tighten expenses, including ceasing advertising in newspapers and other expenses on the 11th of this month, it was still difficult to manage. As a result, a portion of the small commission payments to the backstage staff were inevitably delayed. The suspension of performances occurred on the evening before last (the 26th) due to this dispute.</p>
<p>Currently Mediating, Expected to Resume: According to a person from the theater, the management promised to mediate the small commission payment issue at 5:00 PM the evening before last. However, negotiations failed, so some actors refused to perform. Mediation is continuing, and performances are expected to resume within days. As for the large commission payments to Zhao Ruquan and others, there is no problem. After the theater's sudden suspension of performances, the general audience, unaware of the truth, still went to see the show yesterday, only to find that it had been suspended, and all shouted that they had been cheated.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Salt Fan Special Issue: First Prize-Winning Essay Announced, Winner: Liu Jun <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jing Benbai, president of the Salt Administration Magazine, launched the first prize-winning essay contest for the Salt Fan Special Issue last November. The results have now been reviewed by integrity experts. Although more than ten people wrote about Topic A (A Plan and Procedure for Implementing the Salt Law), only Mr. Liu Hanlie was selected. Mr. Liu's original name is Juan, and he is a specialist in salt affairs at the Institute of Social Sciences of the Academia Sinica. The plan he proposed is thorough and precise, excelling not only in writing. Dr. Zuo Shuzhen, a salt law expert, commented that it was carefully written based on the new law, planning everything in an orderly manner, showing enthusiasm for salt affairs and research. He added that this essay was the best submission for this topic. Mr. Chen Changheng, a member of the Legislative Yuan and the original drafter of the Salt Law, commented that the essay had a full understanding of the legislative spirit and a detailed design of the implementation procedure, and was a masterpiece. Mr. Jing Benbai commented that the design was thorough and feasible. He quoted Mencius's words to Duke Wen of Teng: "If a king arises, he will surely take it as a model." If the salt law is not implemented, then so be it. If it is to be implemented, then it must be modeled after this. The author has only studied salt affairs for three years, yet his progress is so great. The younger generation is formidable, and there are successors. There is hope for reform. The original first prize of 300 yuan will be awarded to Mr. Liu, and the second prize will be added to the award to Mr. Liu, for a total of 500 yuan. The original manuscript has over 30,000 words. In addition to being published in the Salt Fan Special Issue, it will also be sent to major newspapers for publication. The second essay contest will be based on last year's Topic B (Drafts of the Salt Law Implementation Act, except for the ninth item, the Law on Punishing Private Salt, which has been changed to Regulations on Penalties for Evasion of Salt Tax, the rest remains the same). The essay rules have been seen in this newspaper's advertisement.</p>

<p>Hu Fuchu, who claimed to be an employee of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, with a thin face, tall stature, short beard, and wearing a Western suit, came to the Zhen Dan University Library in West Shanghai to sell the China Labor Yearbook, which was commissioned by the Ministry of Industry to be sold by the Zhengzhong Book Company, priced at five yuan per copy. The school, seeing the signatures of Jiaotong University and other institutions on his sales book, purchased a copy without suspicion, calculating at 80% of the listed price, paying four yuan. Mr. Hu wrote a receipt on his business card. Unexpectedly, after checking the Zhengzhong Book Company's catalog, the hardcover edition was only sold for three yuan and fifty cents. After closer inspection, it was found that the copyright page had been torn off and the price had been reprinted, revealing the deception. Therefore, the school sent a letter to the Shanghai Distribution Office of Zhengzhong Book Company, reporting the deception. The bureau immediately reported to the Nanjing General Bureau, requesting an investigation from the Ministry of Industry nearby and instructions on how to handle the situation. The bureau has now received a reply from the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, stating, "We have received your letter and understand the situation. We have no such person as Hu Fuchu in our department. It is obviously an impersonation. In addition to secretly investigating through other means, please also inform Zhen Dan University and other libraries that if this situation is discovered again, please immediately detain the person and send them to the competent authorities for investigation. We are responding to your inquiry." The bureau, believing that there was no Mr. Hu in the Ministry of Industry, sent a letter to Zhen Dan University and issued a statement in the newspaper, and is conducting a thorough investigation to warn against wrongdoing.</p>

<h3 id="e105">High Court Third Branch Under Heavy Security: Gu Zhuxuan's Appeal Case Heard, Judge Ordered Gu to State Himself Yesterday, Gu Said He Was Completely Falsely Accused, Zhao Guangfu's Testimony Was Evasive, Much of What He Said Was Unrelated to the Case, Zhang Tinggui Was Called to Testify, Describing the Events Before and After the Shooting of Tang Jiapeng <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage from Yancheng, was implicated in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World. After being reported and arrested by the convicted Zhao Guangfu for incitement, he appealed to the High Court Third Branch against the fifteen-year prison sentence imposed by the Second Special District Court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the hearing. The High Court also took precautions, as it considered the case to be serious, and the security was as strict as before at the Second Special District Court. After 12 o'clock, the Second Special District Court ordered the eastern side door to be closed and entry and exit through the main entrance. The French police also dispatched a reserve team of Chinese police officers to distribute around the court to guard and protect, and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order together with the French police.</p>
<p>Gu's relatives and friends who came to court to listen did not decrease due to the cloudy and rainy weather. Those who arrived early received tickets to enter the first courtroom and sat quietly for the trial. Those who arrived late could not enter without tickets and had to wait outside for news. Gu Zhuxuan was still detained in the Guangci Hospital due to illness. The bailiff went to the hospital with the High Court Third Branch's warrant and brought Gu to the criminal court one, where the judge, accompanied by the clerk Wu Jiayu, together with the prosecutor Dong Qiming, opened a collegiate panel for trial. The Police Affairs Office was represented in court by lawyer Yao Zhaodi. The legal advisor of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Mr. Jiatang (transliteration) and his secretary Mr. Li Jiaer (transliteration) also attended to listen. After the court opened, Gu arrived. Gu wore a blue silk-lined velvet robe, with short stubble on his upper lip. Standing before the case, the judge first asked his age, place of origin, occupation, and address. Then, the judge stated that he had been sentenced to fifteen years in prison and had filed an appeal. He asked him to state the reasons for his appeal. Gu replied, "I have a lawyer, please let the lawyer speak for me." The judge said, "You can state it yourself, you don't need a lawyer to speak for you." Gu immediately stated his reasons, saying, "I was really</p>
<p>completely falsely accused. The most obvious thing is, how can someone owe money for two or three years? I really don't know the facts. Moreover, Tang Jiapeng and I are the best of friends, and we are also fellow apprentices. I have never committed a crime in Shanghai in the past thirty or forty years. This time, I have been falsely accused, and I ask the court to seek justice. Zhao Guangfu wanted to blackmail me, the facts are all there." The judge asked, "Did you know Tang Jiapeng?" Gu replied, "He was my best friend. We often met at Huang's house. We don't share wealth or work together, so how can there be resentment?" The judge asked, "What relationship does Tang Jiapeng have with your Tianchan Stage?" Gu replied, "No relationship. I run the Tianchan Stage, and he is the manager of the Great World.</p>
<p>We have no grudges. "The judge asked, "Do you know Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi (i.e., Zhang Tinggui)?" Gu replied, "I don't know them." The judge asked, "Do you know Wang Xinggao?" Gu replied, "He is a debt collector. I often see him in the newspapers." The judge asked, "Do you have a mentor-student relationship with Wang Xinggao?" Gu replied, "No relationship. We are just from the same village." The judge asked, "According to you, you don't even know the names of Zhao and Zhang?" Gu replied, "Yes. I heard in court that they said they were rickshaw pullers." The judge asked, "The three letters presented, one from Zhao Guangfu to you, and two from Xue Zhenyi to you, when did you receive Zhao's letter?" Gu replied, "I received it at home, and it was found later." The judge asked, "Do you know what the letter said?" Gu replied, "At that time, I was sick, and my family told me that</p>
<p>he wanted to bite me and would not bite unless I gave him money." The judge asked, "What did Xue's letter say? You should know that, right?" Gu replied, "My family also received it. I was sick and confused. Xue also wrote a letter to Zheng Jiansan, and Zheng told me that you have this matter, then you should think of a way, otherwise you don't need to pay attention to him." The judge asked, "Who is Zheng?" Gu replied, "He is my relative, he used to be a messenger, and he worked in the party headquarters. He is also a businessman now." The judge asked, "Is Wang Xing really your apprentice?" Gu replied, "There is no such thing." The judge asked, "What is the relationship between Wang, Zhao, Zhang, etc.?" Gu replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "Is the Da Jiangnan Hotel yours? When did it open?" Gu replied, "I opened it before the January 28th Incident. I don't often go there." The judge asked,</p>
<p>"Have you been to the Asia Hotel?" Gu replied, "This is a small hotel. I have never been there." The judge asked, "Have you been to the Asia Hotel for other matters in the past year?" Gu replied, "I have never been there. The accountant and the receptionist have testified before." The judge asked, "How did you get to know Xue Zhenyi?" Gu replied, "He is the head of the Red Cross rescue team. I am a director in the Red Cross. During the January 28th Incident, I ran a refugee camp and met him." The judge asked, "Why did Xue call you teacher?" Gu replied, "That was his polite way of addressing me." After questioning to this point, when Zhao Guangfu was ordered to be brought up, Gu Zhuxuan's defense lawyer Xue Dubi stated to the court that the appellant was not fully recovered from his illness and was not clear-minded. He was afraid that he would not be able to stand for a long time, and his body would not be able to support it. He requested the court to allow</p>
<p>him to be seated while waiting for questioning. The court approved, and a chair was given. However, it was ordered that he must stand up when giving testimony. Gu agreed and sat down. Then Zhao Guangfu was brought to the case. The judge first asked his age, place of origin, occupation, and address. Then, the judge told Zhao that today he was being questioned about the matter of him reporting Gu Zhuxuan, and he should tell the truth and not lie. He was ordered to state the beginning and end of the Tang case. Zhao stood still and did not speak. After the court urged him, Zhao spoke from the section of being arrested by the Putuo Road police station on June 24th, all of which were unrelated to the Tang case. After the court ordered him to state the events before and after the killing of Tang, not to talk about matters outside the case, Zhao still stammered. Then, the court reviewed the case file from the previous case and questioned Zhao. Zhao's testimony was generally the same as in the previous case, but when he testified, he</p>
<p>stammered or feigned a dull state. After the court questioned Zhao in detail, Gu's defense lawyer Shan Yuhua rose and said that last time he requested to review the files, he only reviewed the files of this case, and the files of previous cases were not reviewed. In addition to the ten points of reasons raised by the appellant, there are a few more points. He requested a scheduled file review to supplement the reasons. He said that he had another court hearing at the moment, and asked to be allowed to leave the court first. The court stated that he could review the files except for Wednesday, Saturday afternoons. If the lawyer had another case, he could leave first. Lawyer Shan left first. Later, the court ordered Zhang Tinggui (i.e., Xiaosizi) to be brought to the case. After asking his age and origin, the judge informed him that he</p>
<p>should tell the truth and ordered him to take an oath before ordering him to state the situation before and after the killing of Tang. Zhang testified that there were four people who killed Tang Jiapeng, namely Gu Dunyang, Zhou Qifu, Zhao Guangfu, and me. First, on June 12, I met Wang Jinkui at the intersection of Chang'an Road and Hengfeng Road in Zhabei. I asked him to find me a job. He said that he would ask Zhou Qifu to call me to the Asia Hotel tomorrow. I asked him what it was about. He said that he wanted to beat to death an enemy. On the next day, June 13, Zhou Qifu came to call me to the Asia Hotel. There were six or seven people in the room. He told me to wait outside. I did not know Gu Zhuxuan at first. Later, I saw Gu take out two pistols and give them to Wang Jinkui, and said that he entrusted this matter to him (referring to Wang Jinkui), and then went out. Wang told me that the one who was just now was the fourth boss, Gu. Then Gu Dunyang, Zhou Qifu, Wang Jinkui, and I went to Luzon Road</p>
<p>in front of Tang's house to take a look, and then went home. Before leaving, Wang told me that I must come. On June 16, I first waited at the Tiger Stove on Longmen Road. At 11:00 PM, Zhao Guangfu came. I did not know Zhao. Wang said to call Zhao and Gu Dunyang to beat Tang Xiapeng. Sun Er pulled a rickshaw to deliver the pistol. Nothing happened that night. The next evening, we met at the original place and waited under the big clock opposite the Great World. Zhou Qifu asked me to look at the rickshaw. He walked over, and then I heard gunshots. Zhou came back and told me to go back, and said that if the person died tomorrow, go to the Baker Road teahouse in the morning to get money. The next day, Zhou brought me to the Baker Road teahouse. Wang Jinkui told me that the fourth boss, Gu, was</p>
<p>in financial difficulty, and first gave me sixty yuan, and gave Zhou Qifu two hundred and ninety yuan to distribute to others, and told Zhou to take back the gun. Wang also told me to go back to the countryside to avoid the limelight, and I could still get money when I came to Shanghai. I went back to the countryside. On August 11, I set off for Shanghai again. I arrived in Shanghai on the 13th and lived in Chadaijiao. In September, I met Wang Jinkui, who asked me to go to the Tiger Stove on Haifang Road the next day to give me money. When I arrived at the Tiger Stove, I was arrested as soon as I washed my face. I said that Gu Si had told people to kill Tang Jiapeng. Later, I was sentenced to twenty years. I did not want to appeal. I planned to sue Gu Si. Xue Zhenyi persuaded me not to sue, saying that he was</p>
<p>Gu's apprentice, and he asked Gu to hire a lawyer to appeal for me. Because I did not have money to buy a complaint, the prisoner Liu Yimin in the detention center bought it for me. I did not know that Zhao Guangfu had accused Gu Zhuxuan. When I was taken to the police station, I was asked to identify Gu Zhuxuan, and I knew that it was Zhao who reported him. When Gu was in the Asia Hotel, he said that he would give ten thousand yuan. Gu did not speak to me in the Asia Hotel. Wang Jinkui told me. There is such a person as Wang Jinkui, who is shorter than me. I have no resentment against Gu, why should I bite him? The judge asked Gu Zhuxuan, is Zhang's words correct? Gu replied, "Completely wrong. I have never been to the Asia Hotel once. Zhao and Zhang are accomplices and have conspired. If Zhang said that he had revealed my name before, how could it be that I was</p>
<p>not arrested at that time?" The judge ordered Xue Zhenji to be brought to the case. According to his testimony, he did not know about Zhao Guangfu's matter before. When Zhao wanted to accuse Gu of instigating murder, he asked me to help and asked me to write a letter to mediate, wanting to get some money. Between March and April this year, he said to me in prison. I wrote two letters to Gu Zhuxuan according to his meaning. At that time, Zhao did not specify how much money he wanted. Zhao looked at the Dongfang Magazine and saw Gu's photo and recognized him. I wrote two letters, and Gu did not reply. On July 3, Zhao told me that he could get the money, and he would split it 30/70. When he said this, the prisoner Zhang Shuchuan heard it. I did not express my opinion. In August, Zhao asked the prisoner Zhang Chenliang to bring me a note. I</p>
<p>still did not express whether I agreed. Zhao also asked Liu Yimin and Wu Shaoting to come and say to me, and I did not agree. Zhao meant to ask me to help him. I have no relationship with Gu. However, when I was the head of the rescue team, Gu was a director and took good care of us, so I wrote a letter and called him teacher. I did not say to Zhao in the detention center that I would hire a lawyer to appeal for him. Wang Xinggao was also brought to the case. He testified that I do not have the name Wang Jinkui. If this name is found, I can be shot. I have no teacher-student relationship with Gu. However, Gu is the chairman of the village association. I saw him once after the village association built a new house at a speech. I have no dealings with Gu. I originally lived at No. 4 Quanlefang, Hengfeng Road, and</p>
<p>I have a bad relationship with my wife, and I married a second woman and lived in Yongxing Lane, Mongolia Road. There is a mother-in-law and eight children in the family, six sons and two daughters. The eldest son is twenty-one years old this year and has now gone to Nanjing to become a monk. However, my parents are dead. After I was arrested, I hired a lawyer, and my family pawned all my clothes. How could I have money to give Zhao Fusi four hundred yuan and one thousand yuan? When Tang Jiapeng was killed, I was in Hankou, etc. Zhao Guangfu was also brought to the case. The question was, did Wang Xinggao invite you to kill Tang Jiapeng? Zhao replied that Zhou Er, a carpenter, and Wang Jinkui did. Wang Xinggao was not there. I have a feud with Wang Xinggao. Because Wang Xinggao, how much money did he give you? Zhao answered irrelevant questions. He was asked, after Wang was arrested, you were detained in the same place, and Liu Guizi heard you</p>
<p>say to Wang Xinggao, "You must bring your father to support me, give me four hundred yuan, and come to see me every month, and think of a way to appeal for me." Is this true? Zhao replied, "That was about a woman." Guo Tang Youmei, the younger sister of the victim Tang Jiapeng, was also brought to the case. She was asked, "Do you have a complaint to file against Gu Zhuxuan?" She replied, "Yes." She was asked, "How do you know that Gu was involved in the killing of your brother?" She replied, "My brother was the manager of the Great World and resigned two months ago. In March, at 11 o'clock at night, I was sitting in the parlor doing needlework, and my brother was lying on the sofa, sighing and saying, 'If anything happens in the future, it will be Gu Si.' I asked him, but he did not say. Later, I inquired and found out that Gu Si was the</p>
<p>owner of the Tianchan Stage, and I also saw Gu Si's picture in the Evening News on June 7, so I sued him. My brother's wife is dead, and my brother's concubine has left after his death. Now the mistress does not care, and the fourth brother is an alcoholic, so I have come to sue and seek justice for my brother." The detective in charge of Case No. 57 was also summoned and testified that Zhao Guangfu said that Wang Xinggao was Wang Jinkui. What relationship does Wang Xinggao have with Gu Zhuxuan? At that time, the Western detective handled the interrogation and investigation, so it was not detailed. At this point, the judge stated that the trial of this case was suspended and will be heard again at a later date. The appellant was returned to custody, and the three criminals, Zhao, Zhang, and Xue, were sent back to prison. It was already 6:30 when the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The most exported Italian goods to China are rayon, with a huge sales market. The price of silk has soared this year, and the price of Italian rayon has also increased accordingly, with each piece selling for more than 400 yuan. The import tariff is very high. Therefore, after the goods are shipped to Shanghai, they are stored in the Jianghai Customs warehouse. Each piece is unloaded and taxed one piece at a time. If it is not sold, the tariff is not paid. Recently, a total of 3,745 pieces of Italian rayon stored in the customs warehouse in Shanghai, weighing 430 tons, worth 1.5 million yuan, have been piled up for a long time because no one buys them. Due to the excessive losses suffered by Italian merchants and the severe shortage of sales markets in Shanghai, it has been decided to take them out of the customs warehouse and load them onto the Italian ship Tenges for sale in Japan.</p>

<p>In order to comply with our country's laws, the International Savings Society issued a notice to all depositors, deciding to close all branches managed by Chinese managers from July 1 next year. The notice is recorded below: The Society is a French company, founded in China in 1912, issuing prize-winning savings certificates and drawing prizes monthly, which has been recognized by the Chinese government. The new Chinese Criminal Law has been implemented on July 1, 1935. Although the law cannot be applied to the Society, a French company, the board of directors of the Society is deeply concerned that managers and promoters in various regions will be affected by the law. Therefore, it has decided to close all branches managed by Chinese managers from July 1, 1936. The Shanghai head office and the Guangzhou (Shamian), Hankou, Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao branches will continue to operate as usual. Depositors are requested to contact the above-mentioned head and branch offices to handle all society affairs. The prize draw of the Society will continue to be held at the Shanghai head office on the 15th of each month. If the 15th is a holiday, it will be held on the next day.

<h3 id="e108">Far East Giant Bell: Invitation for Tenders to Cast - Bell Body Made of Copper, Weighing 18,000 Catties - Grand Opening Ceremony of Another Large Bell Tower in Zhabei <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that six organizations in this city – the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, the Buddhist Studies Bureau, the Buddhist Pure Land Society, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Jiuhua Buddhist Association, and the Shanghai Buddhist Association – have jointly initiated the casting of a giant bronze bell weighing 18,000 catties. It will be named "Netherworld" and will eventually be placed on Mount Jiuhua. As for funding, the following amounts have already been raised: the Buddhist Laymen's Forest: 10,600 yuan; the Buddhist Studies Bureau: 9,500 yuan; the Buddhist Pure Land Society: 1,907 yuan; the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association: 173 yuan, totaling 22,180 yuan.</p>
<p>Material Research: Regarding the material of the giant bell, opinions differ due to its relation to the sound produced. Some advocate using red copper, pure copper, or a mixture of 70% copper and 30% other metals. Others suggest recasting old copper, while still others propose using a mixture of copper and iron. Therefore, public opinions were solicited last month, and after deliberation, it has been decided that using copper alloy is most suitable for producing a grand and resonant sound. Tenders are now being invited for its construction.</p>
<p>Site Survey: The foundation of the bell tower has been surveyed by Li Jingwei and Shen Binhan, standing committee members of the preparatory committee, at Mount Jiuhua in Anhui. A piece of land of over one mu has been selected. The land belongs to the Bai Sui (Hundred Years) Temple. The abbot of the temple has agreed to lend it permanently. Formal permanent loan agreements have been signed, exchanged, and kept by both parties. Construction can therefore commence. To ensure its solidity and resistance to wind and rain, the bell tower will be built using stone.</p>
<p>Another Large Bell: The Baolian Temple, located on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhongxing Road, in Zhabei, is a branch temple of the Guoen Temple in this city. The abbot, Kaisheng, previously lent a portion of vacant land to the City Buddhist Association to establish a Charity Nursery. Furthermore, he continued to renovate the interior. This summer, the construction of a four-story bell tower was completed, and a large bell weighing 3,000 catties was hung to spread a loud sound, promoting the orthodox faith in the world. The construction has now been completed, and the opening ceremony of the bell tower will be held on December 6th according to the Gregorian calendar to commemorate the occasion.</p>

(3) After implementing the 20% off the marked price, similar methods such as gifts should not be used as disguised standard discounts. (4) All members and non-members should uniformly comply with these measures. (5) These measures will be incorporated into the industry regulations. If anyone deliberately violates these measures, the association may propose disciplinary measures based on the industry regulations and submit them to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. (6) These measures will be implemented starting December 1, 1935. All members are specially notified to comply. All preferential coupons, value coupons, prize gift coupons, etc. issued by the industry before will also be declared invalid starting December 1.

<p>At 11:20 AM yesterday, the No. 801 freight train from Shanghai South Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, heading to Hangzhou, arrived at Xinlonghua Station. It was waiting for the freight train from Maigen Road to Hangzhou to connect and proceed to Hangzhou. The locomotive was detached and returned to South Station. When passing Zhangjiazhai, Xizhalan, south of the S516 utility pole, two children, a boy and a girl aged three, were playing nearby. Due to the distance from the railway police and the gloomy weather, the driver Wang San could not see clearly. When the train approached, the two children did not know to avoid it and were both run over by the locomotive. The boy, Yu Sanbao, injured his left foot and had his toes crushed. The girl, Lu Genbao, had her left arm broken and was bleeding profusely. Both collapsed on the ground in pain. The driver stopped the train and reported to the South Station Chief Zhou Binwu, who dispatched police to rescue them. After bandaging at the South Station Railway Clinic, they were sent to the North Station Railway General Clinic for treatment. The girl, Lu Genbao, was in critical condition. The boy, Yu Sanbao, had his toes amputated and his life was saved. The Railway Police Department investigated and found that the boy's father, Yu Ashan, and the girl's father, Lu Yan, were both railway workers living nearby at No. 23 Jixiang Lane.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, in view of the performances of Bai Yushuang and others at the Empire Theatre, where the singing and movements of the Bang Bang Opera performers were deemed obscure and offensive, originally intended to strictly prohibit the performances. However, in consideration of the livelihood of the performers, the Bureau has been sending members of the opera review committee to the theatre every day to strictly review the content. Up to now, the following nine operas have been approved for performance: "Velvet Note," "The Prodigal Son Returns," "Du Shiniang," "Lotus Nunnery," "Peach Blossom Nunnery," "Li Guixiang Chops Wood," "Shooting the Concubine," "Li Xianglian Sells Paintings," and "Returning the Cup." The content of the following seven operas needs to be revised: "Five Daughters Crying at the Grave," "Widow Ma Opens a Shop," "Butterfly Dream: Splitting the Coffin," "Pearl Shirt," "Embroidery as Matchmaker," "Obscene Mirror," and "Moral Retribution." The following two operas are prohibited from performance: "New Son-Killing Retribution" and "The Case of Liu Gong." Most of the operas were prohibited because the performers' singing and movements were close to lewd and offensive to public morals. Therefore, the Bureau has scheduled a meeting at 10:00 AM today at the Lecture Hall of the Municipal People's Education Hall on Wenmiao Road, summoning all Bang Bang Opera performers from the Empire Theatre and the North China Opera Theatre to provide guidance on the points that need improvement. All performers and playwrights must be present on time to receive instructions in order to achieve the desired improvements.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Li Jingfang Dies in Dalian - Dispute Over Inheritance - Concubine Accuses Li's Sons and Grandsons of Embezzlement - Trial Opens Yesterday, None of the Defendants Appear <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Li Jingfang, also known as Bo Xing, the son of Li Hongzhang, the former Qing Dynasty Grand Secretary, withdrew from politics after the founding of the Republic of China and lived a secluded life in Dalian. Towards the end of the year before last, feeling his age, he summoned his sons and grandsons to his residence and personally wrote a document similar to a will, entrusting it to his eldest son, Guoqi, and grandsons, Jiaji and Jiazhui, for safekeeping. The document detailed how his assets should be distributed after his death, with the intention of preventing future disputes over the inheritance. In September of last year, Bo Xing died in Dalian. Initially, there were no problems among the family members. However, his concubine, Ms. Wu, who resided in Shanghai, only learned of his death this spring. She then discovered that the document written by Bo Xing clearly stated that 23,000 yuan should be allocated to cover her living expenses, as well as expenses for her old age, illness, and death. She went to Li's residence at No. 5, Kangle Village, Fuxu Road, to demand the money from Guoqi and his sons, but received nothing. Although she repeatedly sent letters to negotiate, she received no response. Ms. Wu, believing that Guoqi, Jiaji, Jiazhui, and their accountant, Zhou Mengwen, should not violate the will and embezzle her substantial funds, hired lawyers Zuo Dexi and Xu Yinru to file a criminal lawsuit against Li and others in the First Special District Court, accusing them of embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court to summon the defendants, but none of them appeared. Lawyer He stated that he represented Li Guotao and Li Jiaxing, but Li Jiaji and Zhou Mengwen were in Nanjing and Wuhu, respectively, and Jiazhui was hospitalized due to lung disease, while Guoqi was occupied with other matters, so they could not attend the court. The court then questioned the plaintiff, Ms. Wu, who stated that she was 43 years old, resided at No. 5, Huanlong Road, and that the defendants had embezzled her 23,000 yuan for living expenses and future funeral expenses. She stated that she had demanded the money from them in January of this year, but the defendants claimed that the money had already been given to her. In reality, the defendants concealed the news of her master's death from her, and she only learned of it in January. The plaintiff's lawyer then summarized the indictment, stating that the document was written by Bo Xing for his sons and grandsons, and there was only one copy, which was not in the plaintiff's possession. The fact that the document instructed the payment of 23,000 yuan to the plaintiff was undisputed. The defendants claimed that the money had already been paid, but after the plaintiff's negotiations, Bo Xing's second son, Guotao's brother Guoxiao, sent a letter to Zhou Mengwen stating that the money should be paid, indicating that it had not been paid initially. Guoxiao is currently residing at the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road, and it is requested that he be summoned to testify, and that the original document be subpoenaed for review. The defendant's lawyer argued that the case was of a civil nature and cited the recent order issued by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to prevent abuse of private prosecutions, requesting that the case be transferred to the civil court for resolution. Judge Liu then adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of December 11th to subpoena Li Guoxiao and order the defendants to bring the document to court for further examination.</p>

<p>At 5:15 PM the day before yesterday, the International Academy of Dramatic Arts held an Old Shanghai Exhibition on the top floor of the YWCA at No. 55, Yuanmingyuan Road. Over a hundred people attended, mostly members of the association. Dr. Finn, an elderly female medical doctor, gave a speech about her observations and experiences in Shanghai and Beijing, which was quite humorous. Dr. Finn came to China in 1884 and arrived in Shanghai during the 1911 Revolution, having lived in China for over 50 years. Several old Shanghai artifacts were displayed in the venue, especially various maps, which were particularly valuable. Among them was a map of the French Concession from 1832, which was quite rare. Most of the exhibits were provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council and consulates. The association has scheduled a lecture by Dr. Raffler on "The Secret of Chinese Characters" at 5:00 PM on December 2nd, a "Fortune Telling Meeting" on December 5th, and a performance of the famous Greek play "Lysistrata" from 41 BC at the Lyceum Theatre on December 17th, 18th, and 19th.

<p>Xu Zhiqin, also known as Mao Mao, residing at No. 20, Lane 40, Yalu Road, Hongkou, is a beef merchant. Because he is good at flattery and dancing, he has accumulated some savings. In June of this year, Xu received three threatening letters from a gang, attempting to extort 20,000 yuan. Xu reported to the police station and requested an investigation. However, starting on the 7th of this month, Xu received several more threatening letters, scheduling a meeting in front of the mortuary on Feilun Road. The extortion amount was reduced from 20,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Xu reported to the police station again, and Detective Wang Jinru and Detective Lu Shouchang were assigned to investigate. They secretly went to the mortuary on Feilun Road and waited several times, but did not see any bandits. The detectives discovered that Xu had received a total of eleven letters, and some of them were delivered directly to Xu's house by the gang. Therefore, they changed their strategy. In recent days, plainclothes officers had been seen near Xu's house. At 5:15 AM the day before yesterday, a bandit named Lin Guifang from Ningbo delivered a threatening letter to the back door of Xu Zhiqin's house and was arrested by the detectives. He confessed that he lived at No. 5, Yuezu Lane, Dongyouheng Road. The police went to search his house and confiscated a bundle of letter paper and envelopes, as well as writing brushes and inkstones. He was taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and detained. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, filed charges against him in the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court for attempted extortion under Article 346, Clause 3 of the Criminal Law. He stated that the defendant confessed in the police station that he wrote the other nine letters in addition to the previous three threatening letters. However, he did not know Xu Zhiqin and was asked by a competitor of Xu's, who had a grudge against Xu, to write the threatening letters. The letter paper confiscated from the defendant's residence was identical to the letters received by Xu. The defendant also wrote a note in the police station, and the handwriting was the same as the threatening letters received by Xu. Because accomplices were still at large, the police station requested an extension of the investigation. Xu Zhiqin also testified that he saw the defendant deliver the letter to the crack in his back door yesterday morning. When questioned, the defendant evaded the charges. Judge Xiao ruled that the case needed to be adjourned and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further questioning in seven days.</p>

<p>The con artist Dai [Name Omitted], from Yangzhou, recently came up with an ingenious plan. He forged the business cards of the Yongxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Ti Lan Bridge and the Hongxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Xiangfen Lane, printing a different factory on each side. The cards included detailed addresses and telephone numbers. He went to the Ying Shun Yuan Red Gang Garment Shop on Luxiangyuan Road, owned by Yin Shengjin, and negotiated an order for 100 sets of military uniforms. He promised to deliver the fabric immediately. Yin, believing he had secured a big order, entertained Dai generously. Dai then went to the Qinglian Pavilion Fabric Tea House on Fourth Horse Road and, using the name Yin Shun Yuan, ordered 20 bolts of fabric from Song Bangyi, the owner of the Yixing Fabric Factory at No. 692, Hongmiao Hou, Zhabei, requesting immediate delivery. Song, knowing that Yin Shun Yuan was reliable, had no doubts and immediately returned to the factory to send the fabric. Dai Weiqing was already waiting at Yin Shun Yuan. When the fabric arrived, he asked Yin Shengjin to issue a receipt, which Yin did without suspicion. Dai told Song Bangyi that the payment would be made after the fabric was selected and asked him to come back tomorrow to collect it. Song returned to the factory with the receipt from Yin Shun Yuan. Unexpectedly, Dai Weiqing returned to Yin Shun Yuan and claimed that the fabric was the wrong color and did not need to be cut. He said he would take it back to exchange it and then make the uniforms. Dai also issued a card stating that he had received the fabric. The next day, when Song went to Yin Shun Yuan to collect the payment, he discovered that the fabric had been swindled away by Dai. He called the Yongxing Factory, who stated that there was a person named Dai, but not Weiqing. Only then did he realize he had been a victim of a con. Song wanted to demand compensation from Yin but failed, and then took him to the Laobeimen Police Station to request an investigation. After questioning by Director Shen, it was determined that the case involved a conspiracy to swindle fabric. In addition to strictly pursuing the fugitive Dai Weiqing and bringing him to justice, he ordered that the case be transferred to the General Bureau for handling.</p>

<p>The sixteenth issue of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery, drawn on the 9th of this month at the Shanghai Yiyuan Garden, had the first prize number as 111268. It was sold in portions by the Dayun Company branch at 170 Avenue Edward VII in this city. It is reported that a bodyguard from a certain mansion on Avenue Joffre won two tickets, a Mr. Li, a broker from a certain exchange in South Shanghai, won three tickets, a certain doctor in Nanshi won four tickets, and an old Mrs. Shen from 194 Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, won one ticket. It is said that the bodyguard from the certain mansion bought two tickets on the afternoon of the 28th of last month because his master was taking a bath at a certain bathhouse on Avenue Edward VII and instructed him to deliver a gift to a certain place. He received two silver dollars for his efforts. Upon returning, his master had not yet finished bathing, so he took the opportunity to run to the Dayun Company and bought two tickets with the number 111268. Unexpectedly, he won the first prize, truly a case of profit upon profit, and being blessed with great fortune. It is also reported that the company's mail order department sold two third-prize tickets, which were sent to Huixian County, Gansu, and Wendeng and Weixian Counties, Shandong. Telegrams have already been sent to the addresses. According to a Mr. from the company's branch, the total number of tickets sold for the seventeenth issue has already exceeded 1.4 million yuan. Because the first prize in recent issues has been won in Shanghai, the purchase of tickets is enthusiastic, even more so than before. It is predicted that in the one or two days before the drawing, there will be a shortage of lottery tickets to meet the demand.</p>

<p>Regarding the article published in your newspaper on November 26th concerning the meeting of the Shanghai Sixth District Silk Reeling Workers' Union, it stated that Liu Xinquan and Fan Yifeng were members of this union. Upon investigation, Liu Xinquan and Fan Yifeng were previously appointed by the city party headquarters as members of the reorganization committee of this union. Fan Yifeng was also never elected as a director. Yang Gengti was mistakenly written as Yang Genglu. All of these details are slightly inaccurate.

<p>Sales Channels of Various Match Factories</p>
<p>The matches used in our country in the past were all imported by ship, as mentioned earlier. Regarding the sales volume in China, taking Swedish matches as an example, since 1921, the annual sales volume increased from 100,000 taels to 200,000, and then from 200,000 to 400,000 and 600,000. By 1930, it further increased to 1,010,000 taels. Examining the reasons for this increase, there are approximately two points: (1) Because foreign merchants used unequal treaties as protection, imported goods were exempt from customs duties and taxes, so they could dump goods everywhere without any concerns. (2) Because foreign merchants used the most-favored-nation clause to establish factories in China, saving on transportation costs and being able to offer lower wages, the cost was reduced, and they could compete with lower prices. In 1931, although the government increased the import tariff rate on matches, seemingly limiting the import of matches, the number of manufacturers in China increased, making it impossible to control them uniformly. The original power has not been reduced in the slightest, truly making them strong rivals to the Shanghai match industry. Therefore, when describing the sales channels of various match factories in Shanghai, one must first describe the market for Shanghai match factories and the situation of competition with foreign goods. Sales volume, taxes paid, and market prices are secondary.</p>
<p>1.  Market: The match market in our country is extremely complex, with domestic matches, imported matches, and matches manufactured in China by foreign merchants. The distribution areas are roughly divided into five regions: the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region and the Hunan-Hubei region are mostly within the sphere of influence of Chinese factories; the Shandong-Henan region is divided equally between Chinese and Japanese factories; the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian region is occupied by Chinese factories and Swedish merchants; the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region is a battleground for Chinese factories, foreign factories, and importers. Currently, the sales channels of various factories in Shanghai, such as the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region, are a gathering point. Within the region, the market is divided into six areas: one is Shanghai, Suzhou, and nearby ports; two is Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and the Jiangbei area; three is Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Linhuai; four is Wuhu and Anqing; five is the Ningbo-Wenzhou-Taizhou area; and six is Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. The area with the greatest market competition is Nanjing, because Shanghai matches are mostly gathered in Nanjing before being distributed to the Yangtze River area. 2. Competition from Foreign Goods: Foreign matches are divided into two types: imported goods and those manufactured in China. Among the foreign factories in Shanghai, only the Meiguang Factory has a large output and wide sales channels. In the past, it was mainly sold in Hankou and near Xiamen. Recently, due to heavy taxation in those areas, it has shifted to promoting sales in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, causing another factory's products to compete in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region. Among imported goods, Japanese, Russian, and Swedish goods are the most numerous. Russian "Tiger" brand matches were once dumped in China but have gradually decreased recently. Swedish matches have been imported the most over the years, and dumping is especially strong. There are a total of 27 trademarks registered at the Trademark Bureau, such as Spinning Wheel, Ruyi, God of Wealth, Flying Tiger, Zhong Kui, Alarm Bell, Rose, Temple, Three Mountains, Horseshoe, Golden Phoenix, etc. Among Japanese matches, "Bridge," "Monkey," and "Phoenix" brands have the widest sales channels. In the past, they were on par with Swedish matches, but due to the boycott of Japanese goods, sales have greatly decreased. Swedish matches took the opportunity to dump their goods, further affecting them. However, they still occupy a portion of the market. The import amounts of foreign matches in the past three years are listed below, according to the "Customs Sino-Foreign Trade Statistics Annual Report":</p>
<p>According to the table above, the total import amount of foreign matches in 1932 was 370,989 cases, in 1933 it was 72,976 cases, a decrease of 298,013 cases compared to the previous year, and in 1934 it was 109,756 cases, an increase of 36,780 cases compared to 1933, but still a decrease of 261,123 cases compared to 1932. Therefore, the decrease in imports of foreign matches in recent years is sufficient to help the progress of the domestic match industry. 3. Sales Volume: The sales channels of various match factories in Shanghai, in general, small factories mainly focus on this city and nearby ports. Factories with strong capital, such as Dahua and Meiguang, are distributed throughout Zhejiang and the Yangtze River area, in addition to the local market. In the past, sales were limited due to the dumping of Swedish matches. Since January 1931, after the increase in the import rate of matches, the import of foreign matches has decreased, and the sales channels of various factories have gradually become more active. In 1933, the government suddenly increased the high amount of consolidated tax, increasing the cost of various factories, and the sales price was higher, so sales were affected again. Up to now, there is still a downward trend. Looking at the sales volume of various factories in the past three years, one can see a glimpse of the decline of the match industry.</p>
<p>Factory Name 1932 (July to June) Cases 1933 (July to June) Cases 1934 (July to June) Cases Dahua Shanghai Rongchang Factory 25,620 26,197 23,964 Dahua Zhoupu Zhonghua Factory 28,202 20,285 14,616 China Factory 5,385 7,885 Unknown Daming Factory -- 2,640 Unknown Dahua Factory 10,181 8,059 Unknown Meiguang Factory 35,480 17,531 Unknown 4. Tax Payment: Match tax is based on a box as a unit, with each box containing six tins, each tin containing ten packs, and each pack containing twelve small packs, and each pack containing ten boxes. Boxes are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A is a small box, Type B is a medium box, and Type C is a large box. Currently, each box in Shanghai factories should pay consolidated tax: Type A is approximately 13.5 yuan in national currency, Type B is approximately 17.4 yuan, and Type C is approximately 21 yuan. After the manufacturers pay the tax, they can transport and sell the goods to various places, and the government does not levy additional taxes. If the sales location is not within the consolidated tax area, then taxes are paid according to the local tax regulations. All consolidated taxes previously paid by the manufacturers can still be requested from the government for reimbursement. 5. Market Price: In the past three years, the market price of Shanghai matches has fallen sharply due to the price reduction dumping of imported matches and the filling of the market with tax-evading matches. The average annual statistics show that the sales price per box in 1933 was approximately 36 yuan in national currency, and in 1934 it was approximately 30 yuan, a decrease of 6 yuan per box compared to the previous year. From January to June of this year, the sales price fell even more, with each box selling for only 26 yuan, a decrease of 4 yuan compared to 1934. In July and August, the price per box has risen to 28 yuan, but it is still 2 yuan less per box compared to last year. Recently, since the government implemented currency management, foreign exchange has increased, and raw material prices have gradually risen, increasing the cost of matches. Various factories are also planning to increase prices and are currently in consultation.</p>
<p>This year, the market price of matches is low, and competition from foreign goods is fierce. It is particularly difficult for various Chinese factories to operate in these difficult times. Fortunately, the industry is trending towards cooperation, seeking remedies together. Dahua Match Company has also jointly organized the National Match United Business Office with Dahua, Zhonghua, Daming, and other match companies in this city, as well as Da, Tongsui, Huai Shang, Minsheng, and Chu Sheng Match Companies in other cities, to control operations, standardize market prices, open up sales channels, and balance production and sales. This may not be the dawn of the match industry's future. (The End)</p>

<p>In this year's Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament, after suffering a setback of six wins and four losses to Westerners in the first two nights, the Chinese team was unwilling to accept defeat. Yesterday, everyone vowed to fight to the death, and they unexpectedly won eight to seven without much effort, ending the first round. The second round is scheduled to be held on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of next month. If they can work harder, it will not be difficult to continue to hold on to the shining silver cup. The reporter's notes on last night's battle situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Ball King and Veteran - Unexpected Victory - The Chinese team's doubles team was determined to win. Last night, Ball King Zhu Kuan and veteran Sun Daosheng cooperated against the two generals, Que Ke Ling and Bao Shulai. Bao is talented in both literary and martial arts, while Que is tall and strong, making a lot of noise. In the first game, Zhu and Sun were in the best position with a score of 8-0, but Que and Bao quickly caught up, creating a tie of 18-18. Then, they took three consecutive cities, taking the lead. In the second game, Zhu and Sun knew they could not compete with strength, so they changed their strategy and purely used intelligence. The two switched positions to attack and defend, confusing the opponent and making it impossible for them to grasp. Zhu and Sun became more and more courageous as they fought, like a broken bamboo, winning the next two games with scores of 21-11 and 21-14.</p>
<p>Fourth and Fifth Groups - Able to Handle the Enemy - The fifth group, Chinese team's Gao Zishou and Sun Baoqi, were calm and steady, with the demeanor of great generals. The cooperation between the two was skilled and impeccable. Although the opponents, Fu Aisi and He Siden, had some skills, their connection was stiff. The strength of the two sides was very different. Gao and Sun were able to handle it with ease. The Western generals made too many mistakes, leading to the loss of the opportunity. The fourth group, Sun Jialu and He Shuoqing, faced Kramer Xingqiao Na. Sun and He were good newcomers, with both flexibility and strength, and good connections. Although Kramer was a Western general, he had never worked with Qiao Na. Once they encountered these two calves, Kramer was unable to support himself and had to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>China Triumphs in First Round - The Chinese team won three consecutive groups in a row, but the Chinese team's Cai and Huang encountered the Mailing main general Si Misi and Enger, whose strikes were sharp and fierce, and their cooperation was skilled. They were defeated with scores of 1-21 and 9-21. At this point, the two teams each had seven points. The outcome of the first round still depended on the gains and losses of the last group. This group's Chinese generals Hua Yan and Lai Jin and Kai Xu. Hua Yan was prestigious and well-known. The Western generals knew they could not defeat him. Although Kai Xu勉强出塲勉qiang chu chang, while Lai Jin吓得不敢应战xia de bu gan ying zhan, so they put up a no-war card and announced their abdication. The Chinese team won without effort and triumphed in the first round with a score of eight to seven.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Superintendent Zhong of the Ministry of Education Inspects - Report on Vocational Education in Zhejiang Province (2) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>(4) Provincial Agricultural Vocational School (Acting on behalf of the Province)</p>
<p>The school has five classes for advanced agriculture and three classes for junior agriculture, with a total of 123 students. The enrollment method for advanced agriculture students is the same as for regular students. For junior agriculture, students are selected from designated counties, with qualified candidates being middle-level small landowners who are willing to farm themselves. Advanced agriculture students do not yet have summer assignments. Junior agriculture students have their holidays abolished. Everything except books is provided by the school. Huts are built to serve as places for residence and teaching. School workers are not used; students are responsible for cooking, washing, and cleaning to cultivate simple living habits and hard work. The equipment in the dormitories for advanced agriculture students is between that of universities and junior agriculture students. The dining hall and classrooms are in the same place as the university, and management and discipline are often affected by each other. Achievements in agricultural production and manufacturing are notable. The junior agriculture program is newly established, with no performance achievements yet. Recently graduated advanced agriculture students often work in other provinces, such as in rural cooperation projects, due to being trained by the Construction Department as agricultural extension workers. Most go on to further studies. In the past, most students found employment.</p>
<p>The first year of junior agriculture should focus on basic operations and cultivating diligent habits. The second year should focus on the economic concepts of agriculture and the mastery of planting techniques. The third year should focus on experimental improvement work and the use of new agricultural tools.</p>
<p>(5) Provincial Jinhua Experimental Agricultural Vocational School</p>
<p>The school's recent plan is to expand junior agriculture and temporarily suspend the enrollment of advanced agriculture students, if necessary.</p>
<p>The school has six junior classes with over 190 students. A few are graduates of junior high school or silk industry schools, but most are children of farmers. The students’ levels vary greatly, making teaching quite difficult. Group teaching methods should be adopted. Students with slightly higher levels can be assigned special materials or reference books to avoid the tedium of repetitive work. In the upper grades, outstanding students should be given leadership roles.</p>
<p>The school farm is about 200 mu. Achievements in ordinary crops are noticeable, but the farmland should be expanded to allow for sufficient practical experience. The equipment for all scientific and new agricultural tools is very simple, insufficient to satisfy the knowledge-seeking desires of upper-grade students and should be enriched urgently. The school’s atmosphere of simplicity is commendable, but it lacks cleanliness, lighting, and attention to hygiene, which may give students bad farming habits. The dining hall is orderly, and the food is cheap and delicious, managed by the students themselves, which can be used as a reference for other schools. Students do not have winter or summer vacations; they work and study half-time each day. The spirit of labor is good, but students are allowed to return to school to rest for 20 minutes around 3 PM. Students sometimes do not return to work in the fields on time and should be allowed to rest on the spot to save time.</p>
<p>(6) Provincial Training Institute for Agricultural Extension Personnel</p>
<p>The institute is run by the Construction Department, with 96 students recruited from junior high school graduates recommended by various counties. Expenses are borne by the counties, with self-funded students accounting for about half. After graduating in two years, they are assigned to agricultural and forestry farms for three months of probation before being assigned to various places as extension workers. Currently, there is no problem with their career prospects. They work and study half-time without winter or summer vacations. From plowing and fertilizing to harvesting, everything is done by the students. They are divided into five groups, each responsible for 100 mu of land, with each person responsible for about 5 mu. Another ten graduates are hired to assist and guide practical work. Teaching focuses on rice and wheat, followed by cotton, and then forestry and mulberry. However, due to the short period, they only have labor habits and general agricultural experience, without sufficient technology and knowledge. Practical guidance seems inadequate. It should be changed to three years to increase the cultivation of research and experimental abilities. The institute is comparable to the Zhejiang University Agricultural Experiment Farm and the Rural Teachers' Agricultural Farm. The purposes are similar, but the responsible authorities are completely unrelated. Cooperation should be sought to avoid repetitive work, to spend less money, and to achieve more effective results. Attention must also be paid to promoting rural cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>(7) Zhuji County Junior Agricultural School</p>
<p>The school has three junior classes with over 80 students, mostly children of farmers. The farmland is 100 mu, with much wasteland, which does not conform to agricultural economic principles. Practical training is four hours per day, divided into two hours each in the morning and afternoon, which is inappropriate. This method may be used for first-year students who are young, but second and third-year students must concentrate their work to increase efficiency. When necessary, a 20-minute break can be taken in between to adjust. Vacation assignments should be implemented to avoid abandonment and waste. The annual holiday is slightly idle and can be given a two or three-week vacation. No attention has been paid to the marketing of agricultural products, and farmers still lack faith. There is a lack of new equipment, and there is no experimental work. The livestock farm is very unclean, failing to eliminate the bad habits of farmers.</p>
<p>The school receives a subsidy of 4,000 yuan from the Department of Education, and the local government raises about 4,000 yuan. If necessary, it should be taken over by the province to reorganize it.</p>
<p>(8) Provincial Ningbo Senior Industrial Vocational School</p>
<p>The school is divided into three departments: architecture and road construction, automobiles, and machinery, with a total of seven classes and 170 students. There are also two classes for craft supplementary studies, with a three-year graduation period and 40 students. The school was originally run by Ningbo County but was only taken over by the province last year. The equipment in each department is extremely simple. Although machinery students are required to practice for 24 hours per week, they actually only work for 12 hours in groups, which greatly affects their skills and must be improved urgently. Before there is sufficient equipment, the entire vacation time should be used for designated practical training to make up for it. Road surveying has not been linked with the Highway Bureau, and architecture has not been communicated with construction companies, lacking practical experience. Achievements are mediocre. More design and drawing should be done, as well as field visits and operational exercises, to seek the mastery of skills.</p>
<p>The supplementary classes work 10 hours a day and attend classes for 2 hours, learning subjects such as Mandarin, arithmetic, civics, physics, chemistry, and mechanical drawing. The workload should be reduced by two or three hours, and an outline of mechanical science should be added. If necessary, it can be converted into a junior school. The students' uniforms are very untidy, and the dormitories and classrooms of the supplementary classes are extremely messy and filthy, cultivating bad habits that should be improved. Judging from the past situation of the school, machinery students lack technical skills, fear hard work, and are lazy, with the worst career prospects. The situation can be considered, and elementary school graduates can be recruited and given five years of training. The first three years focus on technology, and the last two years focus on academic theory. Civil engineering, architecture, and supplementary classes have good career prospects. The textbooks for each department, such as surveying, machinery, and mathematics, should be changed to Chinese textbooks to increase efficiency. Furthermore, the affiliated Ningbo Factory should be combined with or merged into the school to provide practical training for machinery students.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Order from the Ministry of Education - Points to Note for Running Commercial Vocational Schools <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities on the 26th, stating, "Upon inspection, the establishment of public and private vocational schools in various regions should be based on local needs and the subjects offered should be specified. This has been repeatedly ordered by the Ministry in previous decrees. However, recently, newly established private vocational schools in various cities have considered commercial schools easier to run, and most are simple and inadequate, lacking a proper scale, which is very inappropriate. It must be known that for commercial vocational schools, everything from equipment to subjects and practical matters should be as perfect as possible. The actual needs of the vocational industry should be deeply studied to determine the teaching plan, so that students have real knowledge and experience, and can obtain corresponding positions after graduation. The following points should be noted when running commercial vocational schools: 1. The school bank must act as an agent for collecting student tuition and meal fees, and managing the payment of security deposits and meal fees, and encourage teachers and students to deposit money to increase practice opportunities. At the same time, the educational administrative organs should negotiate with several banks for observation and internship. 2. The school store must enrich its business content and types of goods, and strive for external business to increase practice convenience, not just limited to selling sweets and stationery. The store organization should also be handled in accordance with new procedures. Educational administrative organs should negotiate with several larger stores for students to practice after class. 3. Typing is an important technical subject and must be concentratedly trained, with as much equipment as possible. When necessary, post-class and holiday time should be used for supplementary practice, and learning time should not be delayed, or one day of cold, ten days of warmth. 4. The teaching of accounting and bookkeeping should collect as much practical material as possible, such as school revenue and expenditure numbers, for multiple exercises, with agility and accuracy as the main goal, not just seeking to understand the method, resulting in slow and erroneous procedures in practical application. 5. Each school must set up a complete commodity research room, collecting and displaying samples of Chinese and foreign goods for comparison, and supplementing them at any time for reference. Do not limit yourself to domestic goods, which will restrict knowledge to one corner. 6. The travel visits of graduating students must specify practical commercial problems in advance, group or individually collect materials, study facts, and after returning to school, prepare a systematic report for assessment. 7. Commerce focuses on general knowledge, so the teaching hours for English, Chinese, history, and geography can be more than those of other vocational schools. However, each school often overemphasizes general subjects, arbitrarily increasing teaching hours, so that commercial subjects take up very little time, which should be considered and reduced to match the name and reality. At the same time, English textbooks should be used as little as possible. 8. Each commercial school should encourage students to organize their own stores to cultivate the spirit of business enterprise, not just rely on the employment of existing banks and stores. 9. Most students in general three-year junior commercial schools do not wait to graduate, but instead work as apprentices and store clerks. The graduates often enter regular high schools, so the circumstances should be distinguished to shorten the time limit, or to run commercial vocational supplementary schools, and business leaders should be invited to organize an advisory committee to seek student career prospects. 10. In areas where the career prospects of commercial school graduates are not good, the educational administrative organs should restrict the establishment. When it is necessary to establish one, it should be concentrated. It is hoped that they will comply and instruct their subordinates to comply as well. This order."</p>

<p>—Original by LouisaM. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"But, my dear, you are so tired and it is so hot, you won't be happy. Wait until I go with you, and we can go for a whole day and pick a big basket of wild berries and come back."</p>
<p>"You are always not going, you are always busy, I am tired of waiting. I would rather go and pick wild berries for you alone, I love this, I want to fill my new little bucket," Robert said with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>Big teardrops fell into the lovely new little bucket as if it were not filled with blackberries, but with salt water—this sad scene deeply moved the women present. His mother gently patted his back, hoping that he would stop crying. Little Mei expressed her willingness to stay at home and accompany him; Donn, with his usual resolute attitude, said:</p>
<p>"Let him come; I will take care of him."</p>
<p>"If Fulan went, I wouldn't worry, because he is very careful; but he is helping his father mow the lawn now, and I can't trust the rest of you," Mrs. Pei began to say.</p>
<p>A guest suddenly interjected, "The road is too far."</p>
<p>"I would be willing to carry him if I went—but I can't go," Donn sighed.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your kindness, you still have to protect your feet. I wish I could go myself. Ah, I think we still have a way," Mrs. Pei said, and ran to the steps outside the door, waving her apron.</p>

<p>Increased Stakes, But Small Changes in Premium, Resulting in a Slight Decrease of Eight Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was quite peaceful. Major speculators viewed it as a long-term prospect, and sellers were relatively excited. There was a slight fatigue mid-way. Bank selling was normal, and Chinese merchants came to buy. The exchange market turned tight but then stabilized, with the trend mostly fluctuating. Early morning, overseas silver markets showed Britain and the United States were both flat. Major speculators said that after the market closed, sellers were scarce, and Indian and speculative buyers caused forward transactions to be above the listed price of 0.0625, etc. The forward silver price in Montreux was unchanged or up 2.2%. Exchange rates rose slightly. The London spot gold price decreased by half a penny. The Central Bank's listed prices showed Britain and the United States both flat. Customs gold units were unchanged. The standard premium price was listed down to 1145.9 yuan. Market sentiment was mediocre. Over-the-counter pre-trading opened at around 48 yuan. The morning opening was slightly lower, and after the opening, it appeared weak, continuing to move downstream. However, buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain the market. Mobil settled US dollar purchases, and it was soon pulled up. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with Britain and the United States both flat. At this time, banks still had sales, and large investors also sold, causing more retracement. However, the market situation was peaceful, with small changes. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. The general trend hovered. Later, some large Chinese merchants bought US dollars, and bank selling was not smooth, causing the domestic market to tighten. As a result, buyers surged, gradually improving, and once approached the 50-yuan mark. There were still many sources of supply at high prices, making it difficult to rise further. Indian silver was predicted to rise by four annas. The trend was stable at noon. Currently, although the stakes have increased to 12,096, the bulls still exceed the bears by a large margin of 19. The future will inevitably fluctuate. The market situation for half a day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1147.7 yuan, falling 1.2 yuan from the previous close. Qingfa, Yongchunyuan, Yongfuyu, and others sold from 7.8 yuan down to 6.2 yuan. Mobil bought December US dollars at 0.625. Qingfa, Yongda, Decheng, Fuyu, Hengyu, Huixiang, Yuanchang, and Yong took advantage of the low prices to enter at 7.8 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with Britain and the United States both flat. Market sentiment was peaceful. Chunyuan and Yongfuxing sold out, and Huabi came out with January US dollars at half a yuan, retreating to 0.9 yuan in June. Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yongdafa, and Yongshang entered at 7.7 yuan. Fuxing, Chunyuan, Yongyu, and Qingyong came to sell. Although the silver equalization tax had not changed, it was still reduced to 6.6 yuan. Tongtaichang, Yifeng, Yong, Shenfeng, Hengyu, Richang, Huixiang, and retail investors came to enter. Large investors bought January US dollars at 0.4375, gradually rising to 9.3 yuan. Although Chunyuan, Yongda, Decheng, and Hengyu sold at 8.7 yuan, Hengyu and Yiyu still raised the price to 9.5 yuan. Richang, Dingkang, Hengyu, and others sold out, and then reported a downstream trend. Langyin predicted a rise of four annas. Youli came out with January shillings at 3.125 and 3.75 pairs, gradually retreating to 7.8 yuan. The noon close was 1148.1 yuan, and after the close, it was flat and weak.</p>
<p>The settlement price was reduced to 1145.9 yuan due to the Central Bank's standard premium price, which was about 2 yuan higher than the closing price. There was not much difference compared to the previous close. The bookkeeping price for December was 1135 yuan, and for January, 1148 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1135 yuan. The price of red gold was reduced by 5 yuan to 1142.7 yuan. The spot market price was peaceful. Tianjin goods were reduced by 1 yuan, as was cooked red gold, with a lack of transactions. There were no opponents for swaps, mostly posted by bulls at 11-12 yuan.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (26th), the New York stock market felt anxious about the foreign situation, and the approaching holiday caused ups and downs. Some high-quality stocks were shorted, but rebounded near the close, and the market sentiment was slightly stable. Small exchange stocks also fell. The bond market was mixed but firm. The total daily turnover was 2.33 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e150">Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Shows a Slight Decline, Near and Far Term Distance is Wide, But Dealers Sell on Rises <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the situation is slightly declining. The psychology of most dealers is that the price has reached a high level, so they take the approach of selling on rises. Moreover, there is sufficient delivery this month, and although buyers are prepared to accept all of them, it is not easy to sell them all at once. However, the stakes have increased. As for general non-industry players, because legal tender has a certain relationship with hard currency, the focus is on the long term, and the amount dragged in is still not released. Therefore, the line between near and far term prices is becoming increasingly distant.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Drops Two Yuan: Pre-Market Opening for Marked Yarn, Each month opened with consistently lower prices. Because there was a lack of important buyers in the market, and Wu came to settle, market sentiment declined further. As a result, each month fell 0.8 to 1.24 yuan compared to the previous day's good prices. The afternoon opening followed the morning's weak wind forward. Tongheyuan continued to sell, and the stakes on the table were flooded, and the market price fell. As a result, each month fell 0.67 to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Dafu sold 550 bales, Mingde 700 bales, Hexing 650 bales, Yuda 350 bales, Tonghe 2400 bales, Yuda 850 bales, Dachang 950 bales, Shenchang 600 bales, Yuan 11000 bales.

<p>The cotton market is falling. Due to the weak situation in the overseas cotton industry, Japanese merchants are selling large amounts step by step, causing the stakes in the market to loosen. Export transactions have also stopped. Because the Tokyo market price has fallen by 50 cents, Dongmian Foreign Firm's import ventures for spot cotton have been slightly sluggish, so market sentiment is more fatigued. However, large investors are still buying on dips.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Drops 78 Cents: Pre-Market Opening for Marked Cotton, Each month opened consistently lower. Because Changhe and Japanese merchants had settled large amounts of bulls the previous day, the market has become flat and fatigued. Now that American cotton is still falling, the market situation is unusually depressed, and Indian cotton is also dim and weak. Most floating bulls, seeing the poor environment, have exited one after another, and the market has moved downwards. The Ningbo gang is selling. Changhe, who sold large amounts the previous day, has come to buy back. As a result, each month fell 0.35 to 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening continued downstream. However, American Company is exclusively buying December. Xinchengchang is absorbing large amounts. The second and third plates are still falling downwards. By the time the market closes, the far months have slightly rebounded. As a result, each month fell 0.15 to 0.35 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Changji sold 1400 dan, Jifeng 2900 dan, Tongji 2200 dan, Dafeng 3200 dan, Minghua 2900 dan, Guangfeng 4200 dan, Runkang 6100 dan, Tonghe 3800 dan, Yuanxingchang 4200 dan, Yuan 11600 dan, Yicheng 1400 dan, Dachangcheng 2200 dan, Shengyuan 3700 dan, and Fuyuan 2600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened. The Liverpool news was not good, and Southern goods were released, leading to bull settlement, and the price fell by 3-7 pounds. The market trend was unstable due to the complicated situation in Europe, the uncertainty of Washington's cotton field plan, and the unpredictable Supreme Court decision. There were not many sellers, and the price slightly rebounded due to buying by dealers and predictions of rain. Spot cotton was tight and expensive. Later, Wall Street and French merchants sold, and dealers and shorts bought. (It is said that 9 out of 10 brokers were bullish, and 1 was bearish.) The market closed stable. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures fell by 1-6 pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures fell by 6 points. European exporters sold Indian cotton, and local gangs bought. Pingguo fell by half a rupee to 2 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 26th):</p>

<h3 id="e155">Grain Prices: Flour and Wheat Markets Change Three Times in One Day — High Prices Attract Official Attention — <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The flour market initially declined, then rose, and then fell again in the afternoon. Regarding foreign wheat quotations, both Chicago and Canada continued to fall by about 2-3 dimes. At the opening, foreign wheat quotations softened sentiment, falling about two cents compared to the previous day's closing price. Later, due to the factories not selling, large off-market players competed to buy, causing the market to rise steadily again. Prices for March and April rose nearly a cent compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable. Later, it was heard that the social authorities, seeing the rapid price increases as endless and affecting people's livelihood, were conducting investigations to provide relief. Sentiment weakened again, and many bulls sold off, causing prices for all months to fall again by 2-3 cents. Currently, flour prices are already higher than rice prices. Although this is partly due to raw material costs, it is also partly due to market sentiment.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened in the morning, and trading in all months remained sluggish. However, because foreign wheat quotations were small, sentiment stabilized slightly, and asking prices were 2-3 cents lower than the previous day. At the afternoon opening, initial prices rose by 2-3 cents due to the rebound in the flour market in the morning. However, after the second session, prices fell sharply by 3-5 cents compared to the initial market price due to the repeated decline in the flour market. While the base price of wheat remains solid, high market prices inevitably raise concerns about risks. Yesterday, the market remained stable. It was reported that wheat from Linhuai Pass in Shandong was priced at $5.06, wheat from Liuhe at $5, wheat from Tongzhou at $4.96, and wheat from Shaoyu at $4.87. Fuxin shipped 1,000 bags, and Xinda shipped 200 bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, over 40 batches of goods arrived from various sources (totaling over 8,000 piculs). Sales in this district remained sluggish. Although there were continued purchases of over 4,000 bags by Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai, they were all sold at reduced prices. As a result, the price of late rice fell by 20-30 cents, early japonica rice fell by 10 cents, and Duyang rice continued to fall by about 10 cents. High-priced goods of variable quality were sold in small quantities. The market showed high stability with depreciation in the middle.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 31-32 batches of goods arrived from various sources downstream. Transactions of various goods in the market were slow. Agricultural market prices slightly increased. Special white japonica rice was ignored. Debt turned soft. The morning market for medium-grade white japonica rice was tight by several cents. Although there was some interest from hoarders in the afternoon, the scattered sales channels were stagnant, and prices remained stable. High-quality Yangbu pointed rice was tight, while medium-grade rice was stable. Other goods showed no changes.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the demand for guest-style indica rice remained strong. In addition to rice from Hunan, Jiangxi, Ningbo, and Wenzhou, new rice from Fuzhou arrived. In recent days, both guest groups and local sellers have been quiet, and the market has been trending downward. The opening price in the morning was slightly lower by 2-3 cents. Later, due to the purchase of over 200 bags of Ningbo rice by the northern group and the opportunistic buying of about 2,000 bags of Jiangxi and Fujian machine-milled rice by hoarders, the market began to stabilize. Local demand was average. A total of over 1,600 bags of Wenzhou, Ningbo, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian rice were sold throughout the day. Transactions of foreign rice were rare. Yesterday, only small quantities of ground rice and Huansun rice were traded, each at 50 bags. Prices were similar to the previous market and were also purchased by local sellers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak. The association's prices for various goods, such as spot and transshipment goods of #24 coarse granulated white sugar, were not accepted. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company sold 2,560 bags of Five Rams coarse granulated white sugar at $21.85, with only 100 bags sold. Other transshipment goods, such as Dutch coarse white sugar at $6.95 (down 5 cents), #2 fine white sugar at $21.10, #4 at $20.90, and secondary #2 at $20.45 (all down 10 cents), were not sold. The market for brands such as Xinchao Qingjiu has not opened for a long time. Yesterday, over 200 bags were sold at a price of $10, a drop of about $1. Over 100 bags of turned red sugar were sold at $11.10-$11.20, a decrease of 40-50 cents. Jianbang offered over 150 bags of round green sugar at $8.80, a sharp drop of $2. Dozens of bags of Xindiao green sugar were offered at $10.40.</p>

<p>The Hankou telegram reported that prices for Hunan lotus seeds were stable and difficult to loosen temporarily, with high prices at $37 and ordinary prices at $32-34. However, according to a telegram from Changde, prices had fallen back, down about a dollar from before. There were no changes in the Shanghai market, and sales were rare. Ground prices for white lotus seeds were quite firm, with good quality seeds priced at $46-47. The local market is stable and difficult to exceed these high prices. Good quality seeds do not exceed $50, and ordinary seeds are slightly reduced.</p>

<p>Silk trading in the local market is slow, and prices are falling daily. Yesterday, 80 average quality white silk, with 2,022 strands, only sold for $750. 78 average quality silk, with the same number of strands, sold for $730, a difference of about $100 from the beginning of the month. Furthermore, few orders are coming from New York, and Lyons has even fewer purchases. Silk prices both domestically and internationally are in a weak and tired state.</p>

<p>Recently, foreign tea sales have been exceptionally slow. Dealers from English and French firms have already purchased their contracted amounts. Overseas sales are also stagnant, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, only Tongfu, Yihuo, Fushi, and other firms purchased a total of 104 boxes of fine eyebrow and pearl tea from both regional and local sources. Selling prices fell again by $5-6.</p>

<p>Since the currency reform, the cost of imported metal products has increased due to the impact of exchange rate reductions. As a result, industry players have increased prices by 10-20%. Currently, prices for copper sheets and copper wire are $1-2 higher than before. However, actual transactions have decreased significantly recently.

<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, since the bureau began inspecting plant diseases and insect pests in July of this year, it has strictly cracked down on imported and exported plants with diseases and insects, especially vegetables and fruits. The purpose is to prevent the import of foreign diseases and pests, to protect domestic agriculture and the health of the people, and to prevent the export of plants with insects and bacteria, to enhance the reputation and sales development of domestic agricultural products in foreign markets. Therefore, disease and pest inspection is an important policy for international agricultural trade.

<h3 id="e164">Industry Self-Help <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The position of national products industries today can be described as extremely difficult. I have heard many people involved in national product businesses say, "Running a national product factory is truly not something humans do. Tell our descendants not to run factories again and endure this suffering." Expressions of anger and resentment are everywhere. The current situation of national product industries, under such adverse circumstances, is truly a lamentable and painful reality. Therefore, many enthusiastic advocates of national products are concerned and planning for them, researching various proactive solutions. Some request reducing loan interest rates, some request promulgating regulatory laws, some request amending the real estate mortgage loan regulations, and some request accepting national product factories as collateral for loans. These are all hopes, after the promulgation of the new currency policy, that the government will utilize legal tender as much as possible to revitalize industry and commerce. I do not disagree with these opinions, but in all things, self-help is the only way to receive help from others. In the current situation, national product factories are characterized by internal strife and mutual jealousy. If they cannot unite spiritually, hoping for help from the government, banks, and the general public, in my view, there is no certainty of success. There is no need to discuss the distant past; even in the recent situation, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, companies still set prices individually, purchase raw materials on their own, meetings are merely formalities, proposals are ignored, public regulations are no match for private interests, and even industry rules and resolutions are violated, disregarding everything and prioritizing only personal interests. This is simply industry suicide, leading everyone to ruin. I simply cannot understand why the leaders of national product businesses are so short-sighted and narrow-minded. Despite the government's differing opinions and factional divisions over the years, the Fifth Plenary Session still showed a spirit of solidarity and unity to face the national crisis together. National product industries do not have any deep-seated grudges or inextricable relationships. Why, at this time of facing difficulties and being on the verge of ruin, can't they cooperate with one heart and mind, unite sincerely, and take action to help themselves? I believe that today's national product businesses can only survive through cooperation, and only self-help can prevent failure. Seeking help from others, from the government, or from society is not a solution, and it will not be effective. The national crisis deepens daily, and the situation is increasingly urgent. Everyone, rise up! Self-help for the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Talking About National Paper Again <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bo</p>
<p>In the last issue, there was an article by Mr. Yihong entitled "Please the Printing Industry to Make Every Effort to Use National Paper," in which he described in detail the situation of various paper mills and the current attitude of various sectors of society towards using national paper. Now I will add some of what I know, regarding the situation of paper mills as follows: The Longzhang Paper Mill produces leather paper and white paper in addition to Lian Shi paper and Daolin paper. The Tianzhang Paper Mill may have the hope of resuming production even though it is temporarily suspended. In addition to Daolin paper, drawing paper, and writing paper, it also produces hair calendar paper, wood paper, blotting paper, Fu Shi paper, etc. Jiangnan Paper Mill produces Lian Shi, Mao Bian, Yu Kou, Chong Gong, and Hai Yue (is the most complete paper mill for making Chinese-style paper). Minfeng Paper Mill produces yellow cardboard, gray cardboard, and white cardboard, and also makes cigarette paper. Jingcheng Paper Mill, Dahua Paper Mill, and Huasheng Paper Mill all manufacture yellow cardboard. Senji Paper Mill, Shanghai Paper Mill, Baoshan Paper Mill, and Dazhonghua Paper Mill all manufacture Mao Bian Lian Shi and Hai Yue.</p>
<p>The products of the above companies are indeed very suitable for various types of printing, especially some products that are not inferior to imported products, such as Longzhang Daolin paper and Jiangnan Grade A Lian Shi.</p>
<p>As for the reason why domestic paper cannot be sold well, in addition to the reasons mentioned by Mr. Yihong, there are also several other reasons, that is, the raw materials of the above products, except for yellow cardboard, mostly use wood pulp from foreign countries. Therefore, the price of raw material costs is invisibly controlled by foreign merchants. The productivity of each paper mill is extremely low, which increases labor costs. The above two points are also the main reasons why domestic paper cannot be sold well.</p>
<p>Mr. Yihong also said that paper shops are unwilling to promote domestic paper, and printing houses do not use domestic paper to replace foreign paper, which is a cold attitude. However, I think this situation is not cold, what is even colder is that there are a group of paper shops and a group of printing houses; they clearly use or sell cheap and high-quality domestic paper, but they still say it is imported goods in front of their customers in order to gain huge profits. How many customers can truly distinguish domestic paper from foreign paper? They clearly use domestic products but do not know they are domestic products, and there are other situations such as using second-rate foreign goods to fill in for domestic products, etc. This kind of coldness is truly more ridiculous.</p>
<p>Most of the paper shops in Shanghai sell foreign paper. If you just walk past the doors of various paper shops, you can see signs such as "X Foreign Paper Company" and "X Foreign Paper Company." Therefore, the image of domestic paper in the minds of the general public is very shallow.</p>
<p>Recently, a Dafeng National Paper Company (on Qipan Street and Jiaotong Road) has appeared in this city. It is said that it specializes in selling domestic paper and does not sell a single sheet of foreign paper. I personally visited it once and it is indeed a pure domestic paper shop. The young clerks in the store are all full of energy, friendly in attitude, and constantly talk to customers about the country's economy and the benefits of using domestic goods. Moreover, in order to promote domestic goods, the store's prices are particularly cheaper than other stores. I am very happy to see this. This is truly a shining star in the domestic paper industry and I especially recommend it, hoping that the printing industry will cherish it.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Yu Jiesan Invented Fire Extinguishing Powder <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>China's progress in science and technology in recent years seems to be very slow on the surface, but in fact, it has special progress. There have been many small inventions emerging one after another.</p>
<p>I remember that I have introduced the inventions of Ms. Ding Yusan and others before. Today, I will introduce the fire extinguishing powder invented by Mr. Yu Jiesan from Northeast China. Mr. Yu spent several years of painstaking research and many experiments to create a complete fire extinguishing powder. According to Mr. Yu, "This powder is made by combining various substances containing carbon dioxide (CO2). It has a lasting fire extinguishing property. Its fire extinguishing ability does not disappear even after forty minutes, unlike ordinary ones." Indeed, this fire extinguishing powder has been proven by experiments to prevent extinguished fires from reigniting. Moreover, the powder absolutely does not contain acids or other substances, so there is no danger of corrosion or damage even if it comes into contact with the human body or valuables. Another point that is not comparable to other imported fire extinguishers is that when applied to burning oil, it can float on the surface and extinguish extremely violent flames.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr. Yu has obtained a patent from the Ministry of Industry and plans to establish an office in this city and set up a large-scale fire extinguishing powder factory to be used by the Chinese people. It is said that Mr. Yu has sent representatives Jin Yichen, Mei Ziying, and Shi Rongting to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss preparations with Mr. Shi Bingyan and other well-known Northeast merchants in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Alarming Number of Imported Perfumes and Powders <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>634313 Yuan</p>
<p>The numbers of the first prize of the China Aviation Highway Construction Lottery are of great concern to everyone before and after the lottery period! You could call it a fevered pursuit of wealth! Now the reporter has seized on the public's psychology of valuing wealth to write about this topic of "634313", so that everyone can pay a little attention! Be a little alarmed! Remember "634313", especially the ladies!</p>
<p>According to a report from the International Trade Bureau, "Shanghai's consumption of perfumes and powders in the first ten months of this year reached 6,343,130 yuan in national currency! The United States accounted for 1,318,030 Customs Gold Yuan, France 778,500 Customs Gold Yuan, the United Kingdom 632,600 Customs Gold Yuan, Japan 387,310 Customs Gold Yuan, Germany 340,210 Customs Gold Yuan, Hong Kong 104,470 Customs Gold Yuan, and other countries 35,630 Customs Gold Yuan, with a total value of 3,565,180 Customs Gold Yuan, equivalent to 6,343,130 yuan in national currency." In October alone, the number of imported perfumes and powders was 54,063 yuan in national currency... If 6,343,130 yuan were used to establish national product factories or to relieve the stagnant commercial market, at least it could achieve the prosperity of national products and recover a lot of rights and interests!</p>
<p>Alas! The effect of promoting national products for several years is like this! What else is there to say? But hope must always be hoped... Everyone should change their psychology and safeguard national product businesses. The authorities' decisive promulgation of the new currency policy is giving us one last test!</p>
<h3 id="e168">New Invention by a Chinese Person <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— (Xiang Xian)</p>
<p>Huang Chao, a Chinese paper engineering graduate from Germany, has recently invented a type of smokeless gunpowder using chemical bamboo pulp. Its safety and blasting power are better than the existing cotton gunpowder. This invention is beneficial to China because China lacks cotton but is rich in bamboo. Dr. Babben, director of the Institute of Defense Chemistry at the Berlin Institute of Technology, believes that this product is a new discovery in the modern gunpowder industry and awarded Mr. Huang a special engineer degree, which is a very international honor.</p>

<h3 id="e169">"Spiritual Construction and National Revival" <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Qian</p>
<p>By Zhou Fohai, New Life Edition (Price: 40 cents)</p>
<p>Today’s China is in a state of internal turmoil and external aggression, and as a result, “How to revive the nation” has become the central topic of discussion among insightful people in recent years. Some say that to revive the nation, we must first revive the countryside; some say that to revive the nation, we must first popularize education; and still others say that to revive the nation, we must reform the political system. In short, there are many different opinions and no consensus. Of course, reviving the countryside, popularizing education, etc., are indeed necessary tasks for reviving the nation, but because the entire nation does not have a common heart and a common goal; command cannot be unified, steps cannot be consistent, and efforts will be in vain. Therefore, the prerequisite for reviving the nation is how to unify the consciousness of the entire nation under the same goal, and then can generate collective great power. Mr. Zhou Fohai’s book "Spiritual Construction and National Revival" was written for this need.</p>
<p>This book is divided into five chapters, with the following table of contents: (1) The Meaning and Importance of Spiritual Construction, (2) Observing the Relationship between the Spirit of the Times and the Rise and Fall of the Nation from History, (3) The Evolution of Various Movements in Recent Decades and the General Cause of Their Failure, (4) The Goals of Spiritual Construction, (5) The Principles and Plans of Spiritual Construction.</p>
<p>The first chapter explains what spiritual construction is and its importance. He said: "We feel that spirit and matter are mutually beneficial. Completing spiritual construction is precisely to complete material construction. Because the elements of spirit are not fully equipped, and the conditions of spirit are not fulfilled, material construction cannot be completed at all." He also said: "The rise and fall of a nation, the decline of a dynasty, the rise and fall of a family, and the success or failure of a person, although the reasons are complicated and the conditions are numerous, cannot be explained by a monistic theory; however, the effect of the spirit can be said to be the fundamental reason and the main condition. When a nation is about to rise, a dynasty is about to flourish, a family is about to prosper, and a person's career is about to succeed, it must first have a spirit of vigorous advancement, perseverance, and courage. Conversely, when a nation is about to perish, a dynasty is about to decline, a family is about to decline, and a person's career is about to fail, it must first show a spirit of decadence and decline, laziness and romance, and cunning and falsehood."</p>
<p>The second chapter reviews the relationship between the spirit of the times and the rise and fall of the nation from Chinese history, and analyzes and studies in detail the four periods of the Wuhu Rebellion, the Five Dynasties Rebellion, the invasion of the Liao, Jin, and Yuan Dynasties, and the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, which are cited as the most painful and shameful periods for the Han people; and the reason for causing this shame is nothing more than the deterioration of the social atmosphere and the decline of the spirit at that time.</p>
<p>The third chapter explores the causes of the evolution and failure of various movements in the recent decades since the Opium War and the invasion of imperialist forces into China. The main movements, such as the shipbuilding and weapon manufacturing movement, the reform movement, the democratic movement, and the new culture movement, were all very much in line with the needs of the time, but why did they fail in the end? Mr. Zhou said: "The fundamental reason for the failure of this movement is the lack of spiritual elements sufficient to make them successful. Not only the people who opposed these movements were mostly motivated by selfishness, but also the people who directly or indirectly participated in these movements, except for a very few leaders, also rarely possessed the spirit of great public interest and selflessness, and honesty and trustworthiness... Therefore, the great hope that each movement possessed at the beginning was shattered by the corrupt atmosphere of private gain, bribery, inertia, falsehood, reckless anger, and power struggle, and turned into a bubble." He also talked about the reasons for the failure of the New Culture Movement: "The nature of the New Culture Movement is the same as the movements in the above three periods, because it lacks the elements of the spirit, so it cannot complete the task that was hoped to be completed at that time; the New Culture Movement itself is a kind of spiritual construction movement, but also because the people who participated in the movement mostly lack a sound and pure spirit, so it cannot complete the mission it should bear. Breaking the cannibalistic etiquette was originally a necessary way to transform the old customs that were not in line with human nature and inhumanity, but some frivolous youths used this slogan to engage in promiscuity; developing individuality was also a way to reform the old-style education, but some unfilial students therefore advocated abolishing exams; others used the beautiful name of freedom and liberation to disobey social order and school discipline; or used the slogan of revolutionary resistance to oppose their fathers and brothers at home and expel their teachers at school; or took down idols as the reality, and slandered the respected predecessors whom they did not like. In short: except for a very few leaders and pure youths, most of them used the New Culture Movement as a banner to pursue their private gains. Therefore, the result of this movement, although it awakened some people to the shortcomings of the old society, and also broke some bad customs and habits, and even traditional ideas, however, even in terms of its good aspects, the results were all negative and destructive, without actively constructing a pioneering spirit and a new atmosphere. In other words, the New Culture Movement, although it itself is a spiritual construction movement, however, its result only achieved the destruction of the spirit, as for spiritual construction, it has not succeeded. Therefore, the task of reviving the nation that we hoped it would bear cannot be completed."</p>
<p>The fourth chapter puts forward the goals of spiritual construction: (1) To eliminate the atmosphere of harming the public for private gain and build a spirit of forgetting the self for the public. (2) To eradicate the atmosphere of perfunctoriness, coping, and hypocrisy, and build a spirit of loyalty to what one does and loyalty to one's duties. (3) To eradicate the atmosphere of mutual evasion and mutual blame, and cultivate the spirit of enduring hard work, enduring difficulties, enduring grievances, and bearing blame. (4) To eradicate the psychology of indifference and cultivate an atmosphere of enthusiasm. (5) To eradicate the atmosphere of individual freedom and cultivate the spirit of strict discipline. (6) To eradicate the bad habits of meanness and corruption, and establish an atmosphere of valuing reputation and integrity and emphasizing integrity.</p>
<p>With goals, there must be methods to implement them, so the last chapter of this book is to put forward the principles and plans of spiritual construction. In terms of principles, he stipulated two types, one is automatic, hoping that everyone will realize it themselves; the other is passive, that is, promoted by external forces. In addition to these two methods, I think we can also adopt a method of honor and punishment. If the goals of spiritual construction are violated, the group will issue a warning in the name of the group, because "everyone has a sense of shame and evil," which may have some effect on the negative side. The most important thing is naturally on the positive side. On the one hand, we should use school education to try our best to instill the meaning and importance of spiritual construction to students. On the other hand, we can use social education, such as public education halls, libraries, etc., to often hold lectures and performances to make it deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhou put forward several plans: (1) Leading figures should "lead by example" according to the goals of spiritual construction. (2) Talents should be employed according to the goals of spiritual construction. (3) The government's rewards and punishments should be clearly defined according to the goals of spiritual construction. (4) Social public opinion should be created according to the goals of spiritual construction. (5) Training should be carried out according to the goals of spiritual construction. These methods are of course the most practical and effective methods, but the most important thing, I think, is to change the social atmosphere. On the one hand, leaders should lead by example, and at the same time, the people should be united, and everyone should work hard, so that the work of national revival can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In short, this book is worthy of attention in the current stage of China. I hope that the publication of this book will have a great effect on the spiritual construction of the Chinese nation!</p>
<h3 id="e170">Introducing a Book on Anthropology <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Fuzhi</p>
<p>I have read many books on anthropology before, but after reading them, I always have this feeling: human beings are the same as other lower animals, primitive and wild, completely living a life of natural growth. That is to say, in general anthropology books, we only see the most primitive human beings, completely subjugated to the laws of nature. It seems that human beings have not evolved, even if they have evolved, they have completely followed the law of pure biological evolution such as "survival of the fittest." In this way, then anthropology is also zoology. Moreover, it seems that in general anthropology books, we only see the display and comparison of the fossils of some excavated ancient humans, and we do not see a modern person, a living person. Moreover, the so-called human being is only an individual, not human beings—groups of people.</p>
<p>The book "System of Anthropology" (Xin Ken Bookstore Edition, by Liu Min) that I am introducing now is completely different. First of all, it "puts anthropology between natural science and social science," unlike the old anthropology, which is purely natural science. Because human beings are both a product of nature and a product of society. As long as they are human beings who have broken away from the animal stage, they must not only live in nature and take nature as their environment, but also must live in society and take society as their environment. Because of this reason, the evolution of human beings on the one hand follows the laws of nature—the laws of biological evolution, and on the other hand obeys the laws of social development. The more human beings evolve, the relatively smaller they are dominated by the blind laws of nature, and the relatively greater they are dominated by the laws of society. This book forcefully explains this point from a sociological point of view.</p>
<p>Based on this basic point of view, it puts forward "the unnatural factors and their laws in human physiological evolution." It says that animals only passively change their organs to adapt to nature, while human beings can develop external organs—tools—to change nature. "Society is something that reduces the authority of nature to dominate human physical organs, and it is a tool to transfer human physiological adaptation to the natural environment to the adaptation of external organs." When human beings reach here, their degree of evolution is not determined by the degree of physiological adaptation to nature, but by the productive forces of their society.</p>
<p>Animals' living materials are completely taken from nature, while "the living materials of human beings mostly depend on labor products, and their need for the help of their companions is far above that of animals." The social instinct of human beings to love groups "often expands due to the expansion of the scope of this economic life," so the psychological evolution of human beings mostly depends on society.</p>
<p>Therefore, this book gives a correct solution to the inheritance and environment problem that scholars have been arguing about. It believes that the inheritance of human beings cannot be viewed solely from the physiological aspect, but also from the social aspect, because society is the environment of human beings. The so-called instinct is only a function reflected from the past environment and accumulated by ancestors, and the reason why this function can be exerted and evolved depends entirely on the inducement and edification of the current environment. Therefore, it is wrong to talk about eugenics purely by using the method of artificial selection in biology. The main thing to do in eugenics is to improve the environment—especially the social environment. Moreover, the evolution of human beings is the evolution of groups, the evolution of society, and is definitely not the evolution of individuals or the evolution of biology. Therefore, eugenics should be to improve the human race by social selection. "The weak must be eliminated in biology, while in human beings, it depends on the responsibility that they can fulfill to society. Eliminating the weak who are beneficial to society is not only not a good way, but a harmful act; on the contrary, preserving the strong who are not beneficial to society is not only not a good way, but also a harmful act." Therefore, the imperialistic eugenics that claims that the white race is the darling of heaven does not understand anthropology.</p>
<p>Malthus's population theory is also based on the theory of old anthropology, and it uses the principle of "competition and natural selection" to explain human evolution. But human evolution has social laws other than the laws of biological evolution. "Human beings can produce themselves," while organisms cannot. "The abundance or scarcity of the supply of human living materials depends on the progress of productive forces. The efficiency of human reproduction and the standard of population increase also depend on whether productive forces are developed." "When the development of human technology reaches the point where it can change the natural environment, and those natural conditions imposed on human beings gradually show that they are powerless, the development of the population is even more likely to break through the natural limits."</p>
<p>In short, this anthropology, which is based on new theories and new methods, has raised anthropology from the position of descriptive science to explanatory science, and has also pointed out to human beings themselves that human beings not only obey the laws of nature, but have also changed and overcome the laws of nature; not only are they dominated by the laws of society, but they must also understand society and transform society according to the inevitable laws of society. Human beings have moved from necessity to freedom.</p>

<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>It is not that there are no employees who have undergone modern training. Not to mention large bookstores such as Commercial Press, etc., such as Life Bookstore, the training of employees is very strict (this is probably the effect of vocational education), and the efficiency of employees seems to be better than other bookstores. It is said that most of the employees they hire have received considerable modern education, and there is no apprenticeship system. If there is, it is only a modern-style trainee. However, we know that in industrial organizations, the treatment of workers in capitalist management is sometimes worse than that in family workshops. It is said that the same situation also exists in the book industry.</p>
<p>The monthly income of bookstore employees is only 10 to 20 yuan, and even for female employees, although there is an extra expense for decoration, the remuneration is only 10 to 20 yuan. In this period of rice as expensive as pearls and firewood as expensive as cassia, it is naturally not enough to support parents and not enough to support wives and children. Therefore, few bookstore employees are content with their job, which makes the managers of various bookstores feel the pain of not having good employees to use. What is the way out for bookstore employees? If they do not change jobs, then they see the huge difference between the cost and price of books, and they want to be "bosses" by chance. Sometimes we see bookstores that only print one or two books, which is an attempt by employees to become bosses. Some are fortunate enough to succeed, and their achievements or gains are those existing small family-workshop-style bookstores. As for those like Zhou Quanping, the "young boy of Creation Society," who jumped from being an employee to becoming a writer, it is really not very common.</p>
<p>(6) Editor-in-Chief</p>
<p>We have said that the general manager is important in the new bookstore, but if compared with the editor-in-chief, then the editor-in-chief is the soul of the new bookstore. Originally, nominally speaking, most new bookstores are divided into two major parts: the business department and the editorial department. The editor-in-chief is the head of the editorial department, and his position is important enough. What's more, there are even more than this, that is, one: the initial purpose of opening many bookstores is to publish books, especially books used to achieve a certain purpose. How the business is is secondary. In this case, the editor-in-chief is the only soul of the bookstore. If the editor-in-chief's intention does not match the original purpose of opening the bookstore, then the bookstore is equivalent to nothing. Second, many bookstores, nominally, have an editorial department, and have several editors, but in reality, the so-called editorial department is only nominally existing. The work of several editors is no different from that of proofreaders. Naturally, all publication policies are determined by the editor-in-chief's intention alone.</p>
<p>Understanding the role of the editor-in-chief in the new bookstore, you can find clues for the publication trends of various bookstores. Generally, the decision of the book publishing policy of each bookstore has many factors, but the editor-in-chief's intention is always one of the biggest determining forces. For example, in its early days, Mr. Zhang of Kaiming, from the editor-in-chief of women's magazines to the backbone of new women, was bound to be more interested in women's issues. Therefore, the publication of books on this aspect is also particularly large. Later, Mr. Xia was in charge of the editorial department. Because he was a middle school teacher with history and experience, Kaiming was created as a bookstore for middle school students. The New Life Bookstore was presided over by Mr. Tao Fan, so the most books on Chinese issues and international politics and economics were published. The Dawn Bookstore has always been presided over by Mr. Sun Wu, so many books on political economy, especially university textbooks, and English literature books have been published. Before the gentlemen of the Yusi Society left Beixin, it was a famous publishing institution for literary books. Later, after Mr. Zhao took charge, the style changed. For example, Zhonghua, which was originally competing with the Commercial Press, has published new books in recent years, which are not too bad, but they are not unique. Among the types of publications, it seems that there are more books on education, which is naturally related to Mr. Shu. There are also editors-in-chief who have no preference and no expertise of their own. Their decisions on publishing are naturally inexplicable. When Datong expanded, it accepted a large number of Jing manuscripts. As a result, they were either not published, or few people wanted them after they were published, which of course had to be the responsibility of the editor.</p>
<p>It is not that there are no editorial departments that are responsible for reviewing the book publishing plans, but most of the new bookstores are not very large. Except for the editor-in-chief, there are not many bookstores with more than three editors (excluding proofreaders and "de facto" proofreaders). Even for bookstores with a slightly scaled editorial department, such as Kaiming, although there are many editors, the powers are always biased. The Commercial Press has the most detailed division of labor in the editorial department, but the final decision on whether to accept or reject books still lies with Mr. Wang. Therefore, even if we say that in the new bookstore, the editor-in-chief (including the general manager) is invariably the soul of the bookstore, it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Because the position of the editor-in-chief is so important, various bookstores attach special importance to the selection of the editor-in-chief—no, in fact, the editor-in-chief of each bookstore has no so-called "selection." For bookstores that are opened for the purpose of publishing books, the editor-in-chief is naturally the founder of the bookstore. Otherwise, the editor-in-chief of each bookstore must be the person who has the closest relationship with the bookstore, such as major shareholders, directors, or confidants of the founder. Therefore, in many new bookstores, the general manager is often replaced, but the editor-in-chief is rarely changed.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot fail to mention those purely commercial bookstores. In this type of bookstore, the boss or founder is mostly an outsider to the duties of the editor-in-chief, and few of their related people are insiders. Therefore, they have to consult outsiders. Because of the existence of this type of bookstore, there was a time when the editor-in-chief also became one of the goals of literati to compete for. Competing for the editor-in-chief is the same as officials competing for green seats. Many people use all kinds of base means, and even use political power to oppress the bosses of this type of bookstore. At that time, there were several "imperial commissioner" editors in several bookstores. Because of this, several bookstores had to change their editor-in-chief frequently, and several others closed their doors in the several changes of the editor-in-chief. Such as New Universe, etc., are victims under this situation.</p>
<p>If we purely stand on the position of the new book industry to judge the good or bad of the editor-in-chief, then what qualifications should the editor-in-chief possess? We believe that the editor-in-chief needs a relatively high academic foundation, but cannot have too deep prejudices, and should also have some understanding of the various departments of academics. It is better for a bookstore to hire a literati who has considerable common sense in all aspects than to hire an expert with particularly high academic knowledge but no general common sense. In addition, the editor-in-chief should not only consider the market relationship when publishing books, but also the academic value, and use academic influence to change the market relationship—that is, to create a scholarly atmosphere.

<h3 id="e172">On Gonorrhea and Bubo <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— (Physician Luo Minxiu)</p>
<p>Among venereal diseases, syphilis, gonorrhea, and soft chancre, these three viruses can all cause bubo. Among them, the bubo caused by gonorrhea, although the swelling of the lymph nodes is not very severe, the pain is doubled. Moreover, most of the results are purulent. Regarding gonorrhea bubo, if the secretions are examined under a microscope, in addition to gonococcus, there is always another kind of bacillus. The initial stage of this disease occurs in the groin near the lower abdomen, starting with a walnut-sized tubercle, which gradually swells, hurts, and grows, until it is as big as a chicken egg. If it is not treated in time, it will mature into an abscess and ulcerate. From the beginning to the closure of the mouth, it often takes more than half a year. The pain suffered on the skin and body can be imagined. The correct treatment is to try to eliminate it at the beginning. In addition to the etiology treatment, electrotherapy is the most effective and the easiest to eliminate. If it has become purulent, you should see a doctor for a small incision operation to promote its rapid success. If it has become swollen and ulcerated, then there is only one method of large incision. Sun Weicai and his son's hospital on Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, is considered the most experienced in the treatment of gonorrhea and bubo. The number of people who have eliminated bubo with electrotherapy is countless. If a incision operation is used, the patient's condition and physical strength can be taken care of. It is handled by employing specialized doctors, so it is extremely safe and reliable. As for the treatment of gonorrhea, it has outstanding experience and innovative electrotherapy, all of which can be cured in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Experimental Drugs for Treating Neurasthenia <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— (Physician Sun Weirui)</p>
<p>There is a man named Jian, from Dongguan, Guangdong. He is a student at a university in West Shanghai. He always wins first place in every exam and is highly regarded by the teachers of the university. However, he recently suffered from neurasthenia and often has headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, and fear of cold. He is tired of listening to lectures and does not like to read books. He sought medical treatment from me and complained that his semen leaks in his dreams every night, and it has been two months, resulting in gradual weight loss and mental fatigue. I asked about his past history, because he repeatedly committed the bad habit of masturbation in middle school. There are no signs of venereal disease. I told him to buy and take "Hailbang Tablets," perform cold water friction, and practice deep breathing in the morning. As a result, the nocturnal emission gradually decreased. After taking four bottles of Hailbang Tablets in total, he recovered completely. (Editor's note: "Hailbang Tablets" are a special medicine for the treatment of neurasthenia. General Distributor: No. 1, Dexingli, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai. Tongren Xiye Co. Price: 2 yuan per bottle.)</p>
<h3 id="e174">Quitting Opium <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— (Physician She Zhen)</p>
<p>Opium addiction is especially prevalent among Chinese people. Weak country, weak people, family ruin, and death, the harm is great. What's more, the sick man of East Asia has been despised by all countries in the world. Seeking a strong country and a strong people today, although there are many things to do, banning opium is the most important condition. The ruling authorities are aware of this and have issued strict orders, setting a time limit for quitting, which is indeed the truth. However, it is often seen that those who are addicted to this bad habit are hesitant and do not move forward bravely. There are still many people who are not short of. The reason is nothing more than the long-standing fear of the pain during the withdrawal period. Or those who are addicted to this due to illness are deeply afraid of the onset of the disease during or after withdrawal. However, they do not know that there are good ways to quit smoking, and there are good medicines to treat diseases. The key is that the person undergoing withdrawal has a firm and unwavering will, and the person administering the withdrawal takes good care and consideration. If so, those undergoing withdrawal will not be able to get out of the sea of suffering in comfort, and even ordinary smokers will be happy to quit their bad habits. (Editor's note: Physician She Zhen is a master of quitting smoking. He has quit smoking for countless people. His method of quitting is excellent, safe, and rapid, surpassing the times. Recently, he has newly established a noble sanatorium for the convenience of general remote patients. The rooms are quiet and comfortable, suitable for itching. The fees are very low. Physician She's clinic is located at No. 64, Ningbo Road, French Concession.)</p>
<h3 id="e175">About Chronic Gastritis <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Zhu Qiuyuan)</p>
<p>Stomach ailments are numerous. Gastritis alone is divided into acute and chronic types. Chronic gastritis can develop from acute gastritis, or be caused by diseases of the liver, heart, kidneys, lungs, and other organs, as well as gastric congestion. Furthermore, alcohol consumption, smoking, and indigestion can all lead to this condition. Sufferers of chronic gastritis often experience constipation, muscle wasting, pallor, a persistent feeling of heaviness and distention in the stomach, and an inability to eat much, as overeating causes fullness and pain, along with nausea and vomiting, heartburn, acid reflux, headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. Dry mouth and a coated tongue reveal the symptoms of deficiency. The stomach is the source of nourishment for the entire body. When the stomach is diseased, the body's overall nutrition suffers, leading to various ailments. Therefore, shouldn't stomach ailments be treated promptly? Chronic gastritis is not a difficult condition to treat. If treated properly, a full recovery can be achieved within a short time. For drug treatment of this condition, "Wei Bi Xu Ling" (Stomach Essential Elixir) from Tong Ren You Yao She at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai, is recommended. This medicine contains abundant alkaline agents that can neutralize stomach acid and provide rapid pain relief and anti-emetic effects. It is suitable for patients. The price is one yuan per box.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Leukorrhea and Bloody Leukorrhea <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— (Female Physician Chen Jianmei)</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and bloody leukorrhea are diseases that are particularly common among Chinese women. Lack of proper care during menstruation, inadequate postpartum care, and the use of unclean hygiene products can all lead to diseases of the uterus and vagina. The result is increased inflammatory secretions. In mild cases, these secretions are yellowish-white and sticky, known as leukorrhea. In severe cases, ulcers develop in the internal mucous membrane, and superficial blood vessels are damaged, causing blood to mix with the secretions, known as bloody leukorrhea. Some cases of leukorrhea and bloody leukorrhea are caused by tumors in the cervix, others by venereal viruses, and still others by general weakness and emaciation, or acute and chronic simple diseases of the urinary and reproductive organs. Since there is a definite cause for the symptoms of leukorrhea and bloody leukorrhea, it is regrettable that women often delay seeking medical attention out of shame, allowing the condition to progress and become incurable. This is deeply lamentable. Now, the "Nei Fu Bai Dai Wan" (Internal Leukorrhea Pills) issued by Dr. Wang Yuchu's clinic inside Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, is highly effective in treating gonorrheal leukorrhea and simple leukorrhea and bloody leukorrhea. The price is two yuan per box, making it the only self-treatment remedy for those who are ashamed to seek medical attention and those in remote inland areas lacking good doctors and medicines. Female patients should take note of this.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Treatment of Crural Ringworm <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— (Physician Gu Zhenqun)</p>
<p>Crural ringworm, also known as red inguinal ringworm, often occurs in areas where the skin of the thighs rubs together easily. It is light red in color and is a type of chronic filamentous fungal infection. The causative agent of this disease is the *Epidermophyton floccosum*, a fungus discovered in 1895 by Bruhl-Linder. It is small in shape, only about one-third the size of the *Malassezia furfur* fungus. It forms dense networks and specifically proliferates between the corneal cells with specific characteristics, mainly occurring in the groin area and spreading to nearby areas. Like common stubborn ringworm, it is a persistent and itchy skin disease. This condition is more common in men in our country and can be transmitted to others. The most effective and reliable treatment is artificial sunlamp irradiation or external application of "Gan Lu" (Sweet Dew) medicinal lotion. If both are used simultaneously, the speed of effectiveness will be even more unexpected. This lotion is sold by Tong Ren Xi Yao She at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai. The price is one yuan per bottle, with an additional two cents for postage outside of Shanghai. This medicine also has special effects on other skin diseases.</p>

<p>— (Physician Zhou Kechang)</p>
<p>There are many methods for treating gonorrhea. The most important is abortive therapy, which involves using a specific medicinal solution to wash the urethra and eradicate the gonococci at the initial stage of infection, resulting in a cure within a short period. However, this method is not suitable for self-treatment by patients unless under the direct guidance of a physician. This is because gonococci infect from the external urethra, and if self-treatment is not performed properly, it can cause the gonococci to penetrate deeper, leading to bladder and other diseases. The simplest and safest self-treatment method is for patients to wash the pus that flows out of the external urethral orifice, as well as the swollen foreskin and glans, with cold boiled water from time to time. Drink plenty of boiled water to promote urination and take bladder and urethral antiseptics, such as Urotropin and Salol. Avoid stimulating substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and spicy foods. All things that can excite the nerves and arouse lustful thoughts should be avoided. As for internal medicine for treating gonorrhea, "Conotodon" pills, Tals Conotodon, issued by Tong Ren Xi Yao She at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai, are the most effective. They are easy to take and have a relatively high efficacy. Moreover, this medicine has a special ability to penetrate membranes and kill bacteria, making it a rational self-treatment for gonorrhea.</p>

<p>— (Physician Chen Xingzhen)</p>
<p>Acne, commonly called "zhang luo," is more common in young people, with fewer cases in women than in men. Among young men, seven or eight out of ten suffer from it. When it occurs, numerous papules and pustules appear on the cheeks and forehead, gradually turning from red to black, containing rice-colored granules or bleeding. It can be painful and itchy and often recurs. Applying "Mian Li" (Face Beautiful) to this condition has remarkable effects and can prevent recurrence. "Mian Li" also has a special effect: it can treat freckles. It has always been thought that there is no specific medicine for freckles, and those who suffer from freckles often lament that there is no effective treatment. In particular, young women are always trying every means to remove them for the sake of beauty, but without success. In fact, freckles are caused by pigmentation in the skin, resulting in brown or black spots on the epidermis. "Mian Li" has the chemical action to remove these spots. The effect is particularly remarkable and has been proven repeatedly. Therefore, "Mian Li" has created a new record in the medical field and cannot be compared with ordinary beauty cosmetics.</p>

<p>As if a Heavy Burden Lifted</p>
<p>This spring, I unfortunately contracted gonorrhea while visiting a prostitute in Suzhou. At that time, I only purchased medicines from the market for internal use and did not achieve a radical cure. I suffered greatly. I came to Shanghai in the autumn and was introduced by a friend to the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital in Ningbo Road, French Concession, where I received formal treatment. After using shortwave electrotherapy, etc., my old illness was suddenly cured in less than half a month, as if a heavy burden had been lifted. However, due to careless diet, I am now suffering from indigestion, with chest and abdominal pain at times, and diarrhea-like stools at other times. I have always admired your publication for its accurate advice. Please advise on a treatment method. (Huang Dimin asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) For this type of indigestion, you can purchase and take "Wei Bi Ling" (Stomach Essential Elixir) produced by Tong Ren Xi Yao She in Shanghai. It is very effective. This medicine not only aids digestion but also relieves pain and stops diarrhea. Its function is particularly outstanding. The price is only one yuan per box.</p>
<p>How to Remove Spots</p>
<p>My wife, Ling Yun, suffers from freckles on her face. Seeking medical treatment has been ineffective, which she often regrets. Please advise on an effective treatment method. Also, I suffer from acne on my face, which continues to grow. It is extremely annoying. What method can be used to make it smooth and lustrous? (Wang Jingren asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Both freckles and acne can be treated with "Mian Li" (Face Beautiful) cream. It is guaranteed to be effective and restore clean, white skin. The price of this medicine is one yuan per bottle. It is exclusively sold by Tong Ren Xi Yao She at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, Fada Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia</p>
<p>When I was young and ignorant, I mistakenly indulged in the bad habit of masturbation. Although I have now quit, I have become sallow and thin, with tinnitus, blurred vision, fear of cold, nocturnal emission, and other symptoms. I am in great pain. What remedies are available? Please answer in detail. I will be deeply grateful. (Luo Xiusheng asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) You are suffering from neurasthenia. You should seek direct medical treatment. Physician Sun Weirui at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has deep experience in treating this condition. You can go to him for consultation. "Hai Er Bang" (Health Bond) is the most effective internal medicine and can also be taken. Tong Ren Xi Yao She in Shanghai is the sole distributor. The price is two yuan per bottle.</p>
<p>A Lifelong Burden</p>
<p>I have been suffering from gonorrhea for six years. It flares up and subsides repeatedly, which can be described as a lifelong burden. I have repeatedly sought medical treatment and medication, but it is difficult to achieve a radical cure. I am extremely distressed. Now I see in the newspaper that "Conotodon" can treat chronic old gonorrhea, with effects seen after two or three boxes. I am overjoyed to hear this. Can taking it achieve a radical cure? I have always admired your publication for its clear and accurate guidance, so I am writing again to inquire for the sake of compliance. (Lu Yongming asks) (Answer) "Conotodon" is the only good medicine for treating gonorrhea. Tong Ren Xi Yao She, on Fada Road, Shanghai is the exclusive distributor. This medicine has great membrane-penetrating bactericidal power without any other effects. The selling price is two yuan per box.</p>
<p>Also Suffering from Leukorrhea</p>
<p>My elder sister previously suffered from leukorrhea and was cured by purchasing "Nei Fu Bai Dai Wan" (Internal Leukorrhea Pills). Now my wife is also suffering from leukorrhea, and the symptoms are more severe. However, she is currently five months pregnant. May I ask if she can also take it? Please provide guidance. (Shen Zhuo asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) The efficacy of "Nei Fu Bai Dai Wan" (Internal Leukorrhea Pills) has always been remarkable. In particular, the medicinal properties are mild, so even pregnant women can take it without worry. When purchasing, you can directly purchase it from Dr. Wang Yuchu's clinic at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Like Scabies</p>
<p>My younger brother has sores all over his body, which are extremely itchy, like scabies. They often ooze sticky fluid, causing him much suffering. I previously saw in the newspaper that "Gan Lu" (Sweet Dew) lotion, sold by Tong Ren Xi Yao She at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, is very effective in treating ringworm. I don't know if it is suitable for my younger brother's eczema. (Hong Liuhe asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Gan Lu" (Sweet Dew) lotion can treat various stubborn ringworms, all kinds of damp and toxic sores, and various skin diseases. It is miraculously effective when applied and has been repeatedly tested and proven without any side effects. I dare to give a practical introduction. The price is one yuan per bottle.</p>
<p>Like Gonorrhea But Not</p>
<p>I contracted spermatorrhea this spring and was cured after more than a month of medical treatment in the inland area. I am now living in Shanghai and have not been involved with prostitutes. Recently, I suddenly have difficulty urinating, with dribbling after urination, and sometimes white sticky fluid stains my trousers. I am afraid that the gonorrhea has recurred and am deeply worried. I don't know if there is a place where I can get a free examination. I hope you can tell me so that I will not be given the wrong medicine. (Shi Kaifu asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has a high-powered microscope for examining gonorrhea in men and women. No fee is charged. This is still rare in Shanghai's medical community.</p>
<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3 id="e181">Banter <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>According to reports in various evening newspapers on the 25th, the new residence of movie star Hu Die was falsely reported to the fire department, causing the fire department to make a fruitless trip. According to Pan Yousheng, "Recently, countless calls from the outside world have been received day and night, often consisting of jokes, which are truly unbearable."</p>
<p>From this brief news, we can at least see the following two points: First, the inexplicably wonderful fans suddenly felt disappointed in their beloved (not to mention cherished) star, so they retaliated. Due to the depth of their love, the means of retaliation exceeded the extent of "sour grapes" and turned into action. Furthermore, due to the general cowardice of the national character, the means of retaliation only reached the level of "banter." Second, the result of the star system in recent years is that the film industry has become a deformed development. The so-called "fans" love not the film but the star. Therefore, the every move of the movie star has become the center of attention for the fans. The details of their daily private life are endlessly inquired about, which is already enough to show their "loyalty." Once they get married, and the person they marry is not a film industry worker, it is naturally inevitable that there will be a commotion. The aforementioned "countless calls, often consisting of jokes" is enough to prove this.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the so-called "banter" issue.</p>
<p>The so-called means of retaliation in our China have always been very pitiful. Little Sanzi was bullied by the strong and powerful Big Liuzi. Little Sanzi secretly wrote the words "Big Liuzi is a small cart" on the wall and door of Big Liuzi's house, considering it retaliation. Once the words "small cart" were written, he felt victorious in spirit. Old Man Ah Q also became the old man who was beaten by his son? So he loudly sang "I will beat you with a steel whip" and returned in triumph.</p>
<p>The false alarm at Hu Die's house, as well as the "countless times" of "banter" phone calls, are the legacy of Ah Q's spiritual victory.</p>
<p>Of course, the times are progressing, and Mr. Ah Q has also taken a step forward from the era of "being beaten by his son." He not only knows how to "win spiritually," but he can also make the other party suffer some minor pains, such as "false alarms."</p>
<p>However, this further "spiritual victory" is actually only a difference of fifty steps from a hundred steps. Mr. Ah Q has not changed his essence. Furthermore, if this continues, Mr. Ah Q will never be reborn.</p>
<p>Here, we are not encouraging revenge killings. I always feel that revenge killings are more bright and promising than "banter." Of course, personal heroism is fundamentally unfeasible now. Even if you can kill everyone, such a killing often leads to extremism and short-sightedness, making people only see a small corner of the world without seeing the whole picture. And what is the difference between banter and revenge killings, except that it is devoid of reason and full of prejudice?</p>
<p>The two are simply twins from the same parents except for the different means—both are the final set of tricks of a pitiful nation when their scheme is exhausted.</p>
<p>However, this pitiful nation is prevalent in this set of tricks of showing the dagger when the map is unrolled to the end. They squirt water on reason, are trapped by short-sightedness, and blindly engage in a momentary burst of activity with their eyes closed, without considering what it will accomplish in reality or what damage or threat it will pose to the enemy.</p>
<p>As for making a trap for themselves to jump into, "bantering" with movie stars is even more superficial and ridiculous.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Sound of Night Rain <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Several consecutive days of gloomy weather are really making people feel a bit uncomfortable. When you look up and see the accumulated clouds in the sky, you immediately worry and dislike that it will rain. If it were winter, with such weather and a hunting north wind blowing outdoors, you could still shift your dull and bored mood to imagining the snow scene; or gather three or five friends by the warm stove, warm half a cup of hot wine, and pass the days with chatting and laughing. However, it is still late autumn and early winter now. In this Jiangnan area, it is not yet time for snow. The accumulated clouds in the sky will definitely cause rainy days.</p>
<p>Rain only gives me annoyance. My reason for disliking rain is very simple. If I were now living in a city street in Shanghai, with a thoroughfare asphalt road right outside the window, I might be able to leisurely lean on the glass window and admire the street scene in the rain when it rains. This is just a small town on the outskirts of Shanghai. Rainy days only make this small town lonely and deserted, and the roads are also muddy and difficult to walk on. People can only stay in the house all day, listening to the ticking eaves dripping and enduring every second and minute with a bored mood, and can't help but feel how difficult it is to endure these idle days. Everything has become illusory and unreliable, intangible. If it is sunny, this small town can show its inherent beauty: the wild grass-covered fields, the green and verdant vegetable plots, the leaves of the maple trees and tallow trees that have changed color, the boatmen floating on the river, the morning glow, the evening glow, the cloud shadows, and the sounds of birds, all of these scenery are enough for me to linger and savor, giving me a temporary intoxication, washing away the shadows of life that are depressed in my heart; and when I am tired of reading in the morning, evening, or middle of the day, I can sit leisurely by the door with a cup of boiled water, listening to the voices of the hawkers walking in and out of the alley, or the creaking sounds of the small carts outside the fence; or stand by the lamppost at the entrance of the alley, watching the dust of the cars speeding away and disappearing into the groves, I feel that the air in this small town is harmonious and fresh, and it should give me some days of reclusive life in this ordinary way.</p>
<p>But the rain that destroys the beauty of this small town has finally fallen, starting in the afternoon with waves of</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Falling, the sky seems to be getting lower. Until now, when I am about to take off my clothes and rest in the middle of the night, the alley and the road outside the fence are cold and deserted. The wonton peddlers who knock on the clapper and pass by the alley entrance at lighting-up time every night, the shouts of selling sandalwood olives, the wild dogs madly chasing pedestrians, and the sound of cars, have all become silent, and no sound can be heard anymore, as if these sounds had never agitated in this small town.</p>
<p>If it just calms down like this, I think it will only give me a short-term feeling of loneliness at most. At this time, it is late at night, and I have to hide in bed to rest anyway, and it will definitely not be as boring as staying in the house during the day, making the days long and boring. Unfortunately, the situation is not so smooth. I really can't help but complain that the west wind this autumn is too lenient. Autumn has reached its final season, although it is said to be the Jiangnan area, the leaves of the plane trees should have fallen long ago (didn't the ancients have the poem "The grass and trees wither in Jiangnan at the end of autumn"), but what is happening now, the leaves of the several French plane trees planted next to the fence are hanging unharmed on the branches, making a disturbing and complicated sound tonight.</p>
<p>Before I fall asleep, will these two sounds stop? I am really worried in my heart. I can't help but think of Li Yishan's famous line "Leaving the sound of residual lotus and the sound of rain", which probably refers to listening to the complicated sound of autumn rain hitting the residual lotus leaves at night. This is originally an extremely elegant and unrestrained clear interest, which non-refined people cannot appreciate. If I slightly understood this kind of clear interest, then tonight's rain hitting the plane trees could be enjoyed with tranquility, and maybe I would even stir up poetic thoughts and write one or two poems or prose pieces recording the facts.</p>
<p>But unfortunately—actually, it is ashamed, I am ultimately a profit-seeking person, and the bitterness of life has long corroded my mood and changed its color. Because of these two sounds, I can't help but think of the muddy road tomorrow, the kind of difficult road that is waiting for me to trek through in a tangible or intangible way, whether far or near!</p>
<p>Alas, tonight's sound of rain, I can only sigh a big sigh at it.</p>

<p>— Le Jian</p>
<p>—One of the City Chronicles.</p>
<p>Carrying a worn-out baggage and stepping on the smoky haze of the seasons, I wandered outside for many long years; I was greedy for the life of the wild, and then I carried a tired heart and hurried back to the mountain city, full of the thought that there would always be some clear days.</p>
<p>The dawn light in the mountain city probed out from the dust, and the last rays of the setting sun also withdrew into the dust. The table and chairs wiped very clean cannot withstand the accumulation of dust and are quickly covered with a thick layer of dirt. Every time I luckily sell a package of insecticide or a bottle of styptic medicine, I record the account in the dust-covered long bench. But I quickly came to feel the dryness of watching the door of the store, and I needed the scenery of the mountains and the fresh air.</p>
<p>On this day, my fourth uncle handed me a receipt book and asked me to collect some old debts along the way and told me the route. He also told me whether the houses of the debtors were thatched or brick, and a set of words to use when collecting debts. I set off early in the morning, carrying a large bunch of bright red lychees, and also picked a willow branch on the road to make a sun hat.</p>
<p>Walking on the winding mountain path, the rocks and streams were vigorous, the pines and plank bridges were splashing ink, the mountain city was still throwing it self in the distance between the mountains, and it was as silent as a tomb.</p>
<p>It was not that I was rushing on the mountain path, but that the mountain path was stretching out its rugged and endless body, asking me to patiently pursue the village at the end, ridiculing me. Finally, I was inevitably tired, and my heart was filled with a few points of wandering resentment.</p>
<p>When the lychees in my hand were peeled, I began to set foot on the cobblestone village road. What welcomed me enthusiastically was a nest of wild honeybees and a swarm of mosquitoes from the cattle shed like locusts. What awaited me calmly was a narrow and desolate alley and countless dilapidated walls. I read the names of the people on the receipt book one by one, going from door to door.</p>
<p>I knocked on the moldy wood doors, called out outside the earthen garden, or leaned against the broken walls to wait, and urged while sitting next to the weaving. But family after family, what I was able to collect was not the medicine bill, but a pile of nagging requests and complaints.</p>
<p>"Sir, you are an understanding person: when people contract smallpox, they only burn two sticks of incense in front of the Bodhisattva, and they will be fine in a short time. After taking two doses of your medicine, it almost killed the child in a few days... It was Guanyin Bodhisattva who saved him!"</p>
<p>"We shouldn't have called the doctor at that time. Tiger scratches are a common occurrence; how is a large bottle of styptic medicine as effective as a pinch of green silk smoke? Not to mention anything else, I think that bottle of medicine is just white water mixed with red cinnabar, it's very rare."</p>
<p>Listening to these unclear words, I just remained silent, dragging the shadow on the earth wall and walking away; I turned a corner and walked into a desolate alley.</p>
<p>Three oak-tiled houses, two old black lacquered doors, were originally the home of rich people. The fourth uncle had cured a man, and the bill in the receipt book had been written for a long time.</p>
<p>I stood outside the door and looked straight in, but I didn't see anyone. I gently knocked on the door knocker, but I didn't see anyone. It was as gloomy as walking into a funeral home. Finally, I called out:</p>
<p>"Hey! Is there anyone guarding the house? The Western medicine store in the city wants to settle some accounts."</p>
<p>Gradually, I saw the sound of iron chains clanging in the厢房. I took two steps back.</p>
<p>With a "ya" sound, the room door opened suddenly, and a middle-aged woman appeared in the room. Her clothes were torn to shreds and ragged, her hands and feet were in shackles, and her two jackal-like red eyes stared at me madly, her mouth blocked, as if she wanted to rush towards me.</p>
<p>"Huh! You came at the right time, go to his coffin to collect debts! Debt collector, you come, you come!" She shouted hoarsely, recklessly grabbing a three-legged stool and throwing it over, almost splitting my head open. I ran away.</p>
<p>From a distance, I could still hear the horrifying roar, unable to suppress a string of thumping heartbeats.</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought of the mad woman and the story of martyrdom.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day, the goddesses were all bathing behind the palace. Seeing that the sky was filled with ink, the sun did not have any intense light waves. Fear and panic enveloped the earth. On the faces of the five goddesses, worry and sadness were revealed for a moment. They resented this group of martial artists and barbarians, making so much fear, perhaps they would soon break the five-colored sky sphere. (Five)</p>

<p>Opening "Faded Red"</p>
<p>Official boats moored by the river bank. The rustling autumn wind is bitterly cold. The wise governor of Jiangzhou is seated above. During the feast, the wine is quite spirited. At that time, the honored guests and host are seated in a circle. And also, songs, odes and poems were offered for laughter and talk. Just then, a woman on a neighboring boat was particularly graceful. All that was heard was the interrupted sound of a pipa being played. Who knew? The old autumn beauty was still enchanting. And, the sound was delicate and wonderfully uncommon. It was said that the name of "Faded Red" (花褪紅) meant seeing guests with boundless shame. Before the honorable guests, she lowered her head without a word. Try to ask about it from the beginning. She said, "Since childhood, I have leaned on the door selling my charm. Never leaving dancing fans and singing robes. Then came a desolation without carriages and horses. Looking back, there is no home to return to. Therefore, I married as a wife. My husband went to Fuliang and has not yet returned. This caused me to be a lonely goose without a companion. Only specially, with old skills, do I seek food and clothing. It is only because of a meager livelihood and a difficult family situation. It is not because of my ill-fated beauty. I pity my own circumstance and disgrace my hairpins." Unexpectedly, it attracted the tears of the Jiangzhou Sima. Tear stains faintly wet his blue shirt. Originally, he was a passionate and talented man. His heart broke and his soul faded with two sighs. He did not begrudge rewarding her with heavy money. The horses and attendants returned, and the night was late. Lighting a lamp, unable to sleep, he was bored. He composed "Pipa Lament" and his tears were not yet dry. Outside the window, a curved remnant of the setting sun.</p>

Her family does not worry about clothing, food, housing, or transportation. Her parents are old and enjoy meditation. She is regarded as a pearl in their palms and is spoiled. At home, she studies with her parents. In her childhood, she was betrothed to a fellow villager. He is a skilled painter and a teacher. He is kind and honest and has no worldly ambitions. His family is poor, but his intentions are extremely broad. The two of them are in harmony and go out together. They frolic among the Six Harmonies Pagoda and the Three Temples. In the setting sun, they hold hands and return. Their affection is sincere. Hoping that they can soon become a couple. Talented man and beautiful woman join in harmony. Bystanders sigh and admire. They all say, "A talented man and a beautiful woman are a match made in heaven." Good things are often ruined by fate. Suddenly, the situation changes and disaster arises. Originally, the maiden met a handsome young man. He has a doctorate and his surname is Han. Moreover, his father holds a high position in politics. He possesses both wealth and honor, and his reputation is renowned. She dislikes the painter's scholarly attitude. She completely abandons their past promises. With the doctor, they are as sweet as honey. They often boat together on West Lake. At this time, their passion is hot and their wedding date is set. The former Xiao Lang is like a stranger. Who knew? The doctor's heart is unpredictable. He suddenly forgets old friendships and falls in love with a new love. He actually abandons the maiden without news. Separating the loving couple, it is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, female vanity, you must not be greedy.</p>

<p>"Song of Triumph" Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Bu Wancang's latest masterpiece, with Wu Weiyun as the photographer, Fang Peilin as the set designer, Gu Zongyi as the sound recorder, and starring Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Wei Heling, Qin Tong, Wang Guilin, Jiang Xiu, Liu Li, and Li Junpan, Zhu Tianhong, etc., the Yihua all-dialogue sound and singing film "Song of Triumph" (totaling eighty-eight characters), which is set against the background of drought and depicts the plight of rural areas and the miserable lives of farmers, has been largely completed under day and night work. Now only one scene of the dam opening remains, and then the entire project can be completed.</p>
<p>The characteristic of this drama is not only that the script is realistic and the subject matter is novel, but also that the plot is tortuous and bizarre, and the scenes are extremely magnificent, tragic, stimulating and powerful. Therefore, it is said that "Song of Triumph" is indeed a great domestic film worthy of attention.</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" Discovers New Talent</p>

Currently, she has been assigned to be one of the main actors in Yue Feng's "Wedding Night." She plays a romantic and unrestrained modern urban woman, a standard fashionable girl who only knows how to dress up, dance, watch movies, and visit theaters, and does not know what is called womanly virtue or what is called love. She only boasts about youth and only regards being charming as a treasure. According to Yue Feng, she is indeed a promising talent and a surprising discovery. At the same time, "Wedding Night" can also be actively carried out without hindrance.</p>

What is the relationship between Hu Shan's friend, Mr. Liang? How did Hu Die meet Pan Lang? How was Lin Xuehuai with Pan? How did Hu and Pan fall in love? How does Pan Yousheng tolerate and serve Hu Die? There are also very interesting "pre-wedding interviews" and "special highlights of the wedding" records and other inside secrets, even Hu Die and Pan Yousheng themselves do not know.

<h3 id="e193">Daming Screens "Long Live Love" <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The song and dance blockbuster "Long Live Love" Here is to Romanec, which once caused a sensation in the United States, is now scheduled to be released at the Daguangming Grand Theater starting today. The film is the debut work of modern opera master Niero Martini, which tells the story of a singer's private life and his love history. In addition to Annie Thoros, who played the Fairy Queen in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," it also hired world-renowned dance star Maria and Spanish dance king Ascota Iluk to participate in the performance at a huge cost. The film includes famous Italian songs, Spanish waves, the romantic atmosphere of Paris, and the beauties of Hollywood. Martini's singing voice is indeed like knocking on gold and jade. After the song king Carpanso, I'm afraid no one can compare to him. Moreover, the lingering and tragic plot is even more touching. In short, this is a unique song and dance blockbuster, which is indeed worth seeing. Some people say that it is enough to overwhelm "Song of Love", and it is not without reason. On the left is a scene of dance star Maria's toe dance.</p>
