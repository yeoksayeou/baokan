<h3 id="c1">和平曙光　法海軍允援英　英意卽發聲明　地中海英艦可略减少　意已提出停戰條件說 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法意三國代表在羅馬談話好轉之結果、和平前途今日驟放光明、外部復宣布、英意即將發表重要之共同文告、益增樂觀之空氣、外交家今日以爲或可由此逐漸展開和解意阿戰事之途徑、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間今日正式宣布、法總理賴伐爾已肯定答覆英國、如意軍在地中海攻擊英國海軍、法國决定與英合作云、另據英國大使之報告稱、賴氏對於英國所詢法國將來是否援助英國一事、彼已完全滿足英國之要求矣、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）迭經外交談判之結果、英國今日已允自地中海撤退一部份本國艦隊、墨索里尼亦允减少集中利比亞之戍軍法國則贊成派遣軍艦接塡地中海英艦退出之防務、此項恊定係英國駐意大使特魯蒙今日與墨索里尼及法國駐意大使狄香布倫分別接洽而成、甚辦法規定法國海軍開赴地中海、必要時保護英國之利益、據意人方面今日之表示、現在緊張之局勢已有和平解决之希望、外部發表之文告稱、英法意三國代表之繼續談話、表示威脅歐局之紛爭、其和解之門戶並未關閉也云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）羅馬與巴黎兩處現有所商榷、而倫敦與巴黎間亦復交換意見、故現有和平運動又在發動中之希望、英國駐意大使德魯蒙今晨訪唔意相墨索里尼、而法國駐意大使則已於星期二日往唔墨氏、法總理賴伐爾今日在巴黎接見意大使、據此間可恃消息、巴黎與羅馬間及巴黎與倫敦間刻皆循外交途徑從事談話、確訊現尙未悉、但繼續談話之事實足證門戶迄未關閉也、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國答覆之大綱已於今晨由賴伐爾總理面告英國駐法大使克拉克爵士、至其全文則將於今晚正式遞交英國政府、</p>
<p>據法國外交部發言人宣稱、外傳英法兩國意見齟齬實由兩國報紙對於兩國政府觀點、作不準確解釋之所致、就法國而論、法國準備履行國聯會盟約第十六條第三項之互助約束、對於集體責任、法國自願担任其所應任之一部分、决不推辭、惟就目前情勢，法國以爲尙可不必實施盟約第十六條第三項之規定、法國用意如此、別無其他、所望英國閣員作明白宣言、庶幾由報紙鼓吹所造成之緊張局勢、得見緩和也」云、</p>
<p>意國駐法大使賽呂悌今晨往謁賴伐爾時、曾面陳意國停止對阿戰爭之條件及和平解决爭端之基礎、但官方不願將此項談話加以洩露、僅稱賽呂蒂所作談話、係報告消息之性質云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國近向法國詢問、如地中海英艦隊爲意所攻、法國願否起助英國之各點、法國已答覆允予援助、其覆文已於咋夜交與駐巴黎英大使克勒克爵士、據巴黎負責各界聲稱、覆文已銷除英法間之誤會、法國準備履行國聯盟約第十六條第三節規定遇實施制裁發生危險、應相互輔助之義務云、倫敦接此覆文後、大爲滿意，政界以爲法國對於英國所視爲英法兩國有在日內瓦合作必要之一點、已予以滿意之答覆、聞英國現願考慮撤退集於地中海逾額之噸位若干、惟地中海英艦隊减至尋常實力之前、必須履行二條件、（一）意國須撤退增駐利比亞之軍隊、（二）大局當有可覺得的之進步、此指意國報紙對英之抨擊必須停止而言、此一條伴日後之履行、雖非爲不可能、但英意兩國政府間目前尙未獲有諒解也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦政界今日徵實地中海英艦隊目下不致减至尋常實力、須俟意國撤减駐利比亞軍隊及意報停止抨擊英國、英國始能從事此舉、惟英意刻正在羅馬進行談話、如獲結果、則將發表共同公報、於是此二條件或可由意國履行、法國旣已聲明願於意國攻擊地中海英艦隊時起助英國、英國或將由宣布羅陀撤退戰艦兩艘以報答之、法國關於此事答覆英國之牒文將不公布、大旨乃說明法國於意阿爭議中所取之外交政策、殊光明磊落云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）首相墨索里尼昨曾與英國大使德魯蒙作重要談話、所得結果將在星期日午前公布、此項談話目的乃欲在英意兩國之間澄淸空氣、現信英意兩國間陰霾雖未能一掃而空、但雙方操切行事一層、已無可虞、按自英國軍艦集中地中海以來、一般人以爲此乃英國採取軍事制裁手段、至少或欲封鎖意國港口之朕兆、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據官方消息、英國政府即擬在短時期之內、將霍特號與雷囊號兩戰艦自直布羅陀海峽調回本國云、關於意阿爭端、此間頃接獲羅馬消息、謂意相墨索里尼與阿國皇帝所進行之談判、形勢尙佳、但此間有力方面以爲意國政府所提出之要求、英國未必加以接受、蓋以此項要求、係屬過分故也云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 秉</p>
<p>盛大之第六屆全運。會期延續十一日。迄今日而閉幕。與會之選手抖擻精神。發揚蹈厲。創造新紀錄至夥。今日辭別友伴。各返鄉土。其載譽以歸者。固欣然於聲名之非倖致。卽未得錦標者。亦泰然於吾力之已貢獻。而於廣大觀衆之熱烈屬望。報紙雜誌之一致鼓舞。尤必感受甚深之愉快印象。將資終身之回味。然諸君之離運動塲而散歸鄉土也。其所携僅此而已乎。</p>
<p>諸君來自全國各地。雖遠如漠北西域。亦不憚跋涉之勞。踴躍奔赴。更有海外僑胞。結隊趨蹌。如游子之慕桑梓。顧諸君所從來之各地。殊少豫樂之象。儘多憂患之端。或則强鄰伸爪。勢將攫人。或則災荒肆虐。民為餓莩。或則田園廢棄農無耕耘之資。或則市肆蕭絛。商窮貿遷之技方諸君之整頓精神。以備一獻身手也。同時必懷念及此種種。縈　感慨。何日忘之。而諸君騰躍馳驟其間之運動塲。又位於三年前戰區之旁。諸君於暇時徘徊阡陌間。念此滿被農作物之土地。當時乃曾沃國殤之熱血。更覩碎瓦頹垣。焦粱斷柱。想見當時無數生命財產化為塵灰之慘狀。其隨伴而起之感觸。自不僅欷歔慨歎而已。諸君於斯互訴鄉愁。共弔戰跡。宜必增益其對於我族現况之認識。堅定其關於今後獻身之歸趨。知非集衆力而為大力。合衆心而為大心。即無以拯救淪亡。圖存今世。並認今茲之大會。集各地之同志於一塲。正不啻大力大心凝結之徵象。果爾。則諸君今日散歸。意識界已突進一境。斯行佳穫。當以此為最矣。</p>
<p>諸君具强健之體格。擅超越之技能。自是人生快意事。然其所以快意。乃在有此憑藉。堪以擔任艱鉅。為大衆服勞。至於聲名。蓋身外之物。卽云絕非倖致。亦不必任其縈繞心曲。世有對運動事業作逾分之頌揚者。其於運動員。號之呼之。讚之歌之。乃如馬戲團員之於巨象猛獅。龐大哉。雄武哉。聲聲不絕於口。而象獅不失其為玩物。是豈運動員之聲名。實乃運動員之恥辱。諸君於此。尤宜明辨而善處之。我人更見有偏好運動者。忘其所務乃手段而非目的。騰躍馳驟以外無他事。制敵取勝以外無他慮。樂之不疲。若將終身。是為辜負其大好之憑藉。雖在盛世强國。猶非所宜。况在積弱多難之我國。詎可以此自雄。諸君為觀威所激。發意識界旣突進一境。殆不至陷於此失乎。强健之體格。必副以正確之知識。英勇之體力。必用於實踐之途徑。此我人所望於諸君者。亦諸君所當自勵者也。諸君歸矣。秋風已厲。幸自珍重。</p>

<p>— 頌華</p>
<p>由宜昌到重慶之行程</p>
<p>由宜昌至重慶之一段長江、川人名之曰川江、川江殊不易航行、在昔江輪、由長江下游駛至上游、以宜昌爲終點、不再上駛、而宜昌以上之水上交通、則惟白木船（卽帆船）是賴、江流甚激、白木船逆水而上、非常困難、非由船夫在崎嶇之山路拉牽、幾難前進、及遇兩岸峭壁、船夫不能岸上拉牽時、惟有設法將船停泊、靜候順風、方能揚帆鼓獎而進、因此由宜赴淪、往往累月始達、距今三十餘年前、有英人冒險於川江試航江輪、及其成功之後、江輪復曾屢經危難與波折、始有航行川江豐富之經騐、今日江輪得在川江暢行無阻、飲水思源、良不能不歸功於前人之辛苦嘗試也、然川江之山峽奇險、加之灘險暗礁甚多、故江輪在川江上至今只能書行夜泊、莫敢夜航、由宜到渝、四日可達、由渝到宜、則因順水、僅須二日、</p>
<p>江輪行駛川江、須有特種之領江員在船指導、聞此輩領江員係白木船上之「太公」出身、所謂「太公」、卽指揮白木船上船夫之船長、彼等對於川江航綫、富有特別之經騐、何處有暗礁或暗灘、只須一看江中水紋浪花便可明瞭、江輪需彼輩領江、職是之由、然爲領江員者、例須先經海關査考合格、給以執照、方可担任此項職司、並非任何白木船上之「太公」均可充任領江、至於江輪所以不能在川江夜航、則因領江者在黑夜不能細辨江中水紋與浪花之故、江輪由下游開到宜昌後、每有三數領江者上船、彼等於上船後卽輪流担任指導舵工之工作、每隔三小時即替換、蓋恐久視眼花、致江輸發生危險、江輪之行駛川江、頗有特殊情形、於此可見一斑、</p>
<p>余等於上月二十九日乘「民政」輪由宜西上、先經西陵巫山兩峽、兩岸高山、非常雄偉、且多峭壁、其尤奇者、往往在船頭瞭望、前面但見高山重疊、嵯峨崢嶸、而■■■★于■★■■■■眼簾、故舟行山峽間、有時確能令人發生「如往而復」之感、是日一路盡是特殊之山光水色、又經奇偉之巫山十二峯、眼界爲之一擴、夜間舟泊巫山縣、</p>
<p>翌日先過瞿塘峽·　門·白帝城·及八陣圖等處、白帝城即蜀漢劉備託孤之所、八陣圖相傳係諸葛亮所設、據船上職員云、岸上有旱八陣圖、江中有水八陣圖、在舟中所見到老僅後者耳、下午過雲陽、其對岸有「張爺廟」、祀張飛、廟宇甚壯麗、其臨江之壁上、有「江上清風」四大字、係名手彭雲伯所書、筆力遒勁、在舟中遠眺、其筆書甚明晰、或謂廟中尙有張飛之頭、儲於油缸、若傾以油、頭卽浮出、是否可信、殊未敢必、夜在萬縣歇船、</p>
<p>本月一日過忠州及印山、（又名石寶寨）、山上有塔及廟宇、相傳爲明末名女將秦良玉之故鄉、是日與同舟郵局專員劉君談川中情形、渠云去年曾因公至川南酉陽·彭水·秀山·黔江等縣、其地多匪、險遭不測、其後請公安局派武裝警士護送、始敢至各處完畢公事、蜀諺有云「養子不須教、只要酉秀黔彭走一越」良以旅行該四縣、可得不少特殊之經騐云、考此四縣及其附近均有鑛產、且多荒地、如加開發、以裨民生、實亦不失爲消弭匪患之一法也、入慕過鄷都城、城中有天子殿秦王殿等廟宇、沿江兩岸並有白塔二、遙斜對、在舟中均可望見、有謂兩塔有陰陽之分、實係迷信之談、劉君云、愚夫愚婦、往往特赴該處廟宇購符籙與路引」、（陰司之護照）廟中因此得一特別收入云、據中國銀行所編之「宜昌到重慶」一書中所述、世人所以誤會鄷都有陰府、約有二因（一）前漢王方平與後漢陰長生嘗先後在該縣平都山修道、因此有人稱爲陰王山、後來以訛傳訛、以爲此山有陰間之王、（二）該縣有仙都觀及五霎洞、道家稱爲「紫府眞仙」、於是更有人誤會酆都非凡人之地、因此有人一聞酆都、卽聯想及仙鄉或陰府、其實酆都明明係人問世、旣無陰府、亦非仙居、吾國文盲太多、迷信尙未破除、殊可慨也、舟過酆都後駛至通圓寺小鎭歇夜、</p>
<p>二日、舟經剪刀峽·涪陵·長壽等處、兩岸雖仍有高山、但不如離宜昌後第一第二日所見者奇偉、是日天雨、見兩岸山上大小瀑布、如舞白練、半山之霎、如烟如霧、又如飛絮、煞是奇觀、江中頗多帆船、船上有挿旗幟者、據聞所挿之旗爲鏢旗、表示該船由保鏢人某某所保、所載客貨均較安全、此種帆船上駛長江、往往有許多船夫在岸上裸其身體拉牽、遇峭壁則卽鳬水上船狀甚艱苦、殊可憐憫、同船之中國銀行職員陳君、曾至四川各地旅行、告余嘗見嘉陵江上之大帆船、每有數十船夫、爲之拉牽、船夫於拉牽時、天暖則悉赤身裸體、不掛一絲、天凉則僅披短衣、並不穿袴、然步伐整齊齊唱山歌、如船夫曲、儼如極有紀律之軍隊、其歌聲頗響亮、音調則殊悲壯、又云四川貧民甚苦、而礦工與船夫之生活則尤苦、綠林好漢、犯案而懺悔者、往往投身於礦工與船夫之工作、蓋一則在地底掘礦、一則隨船舶來往各地、均不易被人緝捕云、莫德惠君亦同舟赴渝、下午與莫君閑談、初談華北問題與外交問題、繼又談到國民經濟問題、莫君見外輪自由出入於長江、深致戚慨、謂中國若不能提高關稅、則漏巵總難期杜塞、民窮財盡、夫豈偶然、閒談間舟行品甚緩慢、較帆船猶遲、有人來報、「船上機件有損、今日恐難到達重慶」、莫君遂喟然嘆曰、「咱們都在漏中矣」、語意雙關、聽者莫不動容、所幸輪上機件、不久修復、仍能照常行駛、至下午六時餘（重慶較上海遲足足一小時、其時上海僅五時餘）、乃到達目的地、時已暮色蒼茫、迨余等僱小舟、渡河登岸、則已萬家燈火矣、</p>

<p>價權債務　祥加鞫訊、並選任會計師淸算全部賬目、且曾一度將陸覇押於民事管收所、及至今夏、陸欲與債權和解、擬就和解方案、呈由余推事審核之下、據以通告各債權、乃陸則以通告內所敘和解條件、與彼原擬者殊有出入、認爲使彼不利、遂委託某律師撰狀、向第一特院對余推事提起變造私文書之刑事自訴、請求依刑法二百十條訊辦、（該條文爲僞造變造私文书足以生損害於公衆或他人者、處</p>
<p>五年以下　有期徒刑、）是案由刑庭推事吳則韓承辦、前月、經吳推事開庭時、陸錫侯又復呈請移轉管轄、以被告係屬現任第一特院推事、若在同院受審判、自訴人誠以爲未便、不敢同意、故請求移轉管轄、指定其他法院辦理、吳推事遂爲暫停進行、候上級法院核示、刻下陸之移轉管轄聲請、業被駁回、仍由第一特院依法辦理、於是吳推事因復</p>

<h3 id="c162">願小朋友做個小慈善家 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭刪</p>
<p>小朋友！今天我來和你談談慈善的問題。</p>
<p>我們中國眞是不幸到極點了，不是鬧旱災，便是鬧水災，一鬧起來不單是一縣一省的事，動不動就是十省八省的事情。你想，中國只有念多個省份，鬧災荒的卻佔了五份之二模樣，在這些被災的省域裏的老百姓，差不多要過了一萬萬人！他們沒有住，沒有穿，沒有吃，日夜餓着肚子，冷着身子。有時因爲熬不了飢寒的壓迫，寧願投身於滾滾洪流中，犧牲了可貴可憐的性命。那些小孩子，又不知人事，只是啼飢號寒。這種種慘目傷心的情形，豈不眞像一座座的人間地獄</p>
<p>是的，他們是在人間地獄裏，受着難堪的災難，而你們，我親愛的小朋友呀，却是在天堂裏！你們並沒有遇見過水旱之災，也不缺了衣食住行的滿意的享受，該是開心快樂的。但我深望諸位小朋友在開心快樂中，想一想那些正在災區裏的許多可憐的小朋友，並且想法子去救濟他們。</p>
<p>救濟的方法無他，就是量力捐點錢鈔，或者衣服給他們便行。你看，本埠有一個小朋友司徒祖培君，在九月十五日親自拿了他平日積蓄下來的糖菓錢，一共十五千九百九十文，送到本報館來，呌本報館轉送給水災救濟會，以救災民。我們覺得，司徒君眞是一個可敬可愛的小學生！他寧願自己不買零食吃，將這些銀錢拿出來救濟災民，良心上何等安慰呢！我願許多小朋友，也學學司徒君，節省了買糖菓的錢，送給本報館或水災救濟會，做一件大大的功德吧！</p>
<h3 id="c163">紀昌學射 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 魏冰心</p>
<p>不論求學作事，或習練一種技術，倘使能够專心而不間斷，任阿艱難的工作，必定可以完成。你若不信。請讀下面的故事。</p>
<p>古時候，有一個射箭的好手，名叫甘蠅。他的本領，非常高强。不論甚麼飛禽走獸，也不論大小，遠近，高低，只要眼睛看得見，便沒有射不中。甘蠅有一個徒弟，名叫飛衛，飛衛習練了多時，技巧竟勝過甘蠅；飛衛也有一個徒弟，名叫紀昌，紀昌習練了多時，技巧又勝過飛衛。</p>
<p>當紀昌初到飛衛那裏學習射箭的時候，飛衛對他說道：「你要學習射箭，最先應該鍜鍊目力。要使兩眼睜著的時候，不論甚麽東西戳過來，眼珠不會轉動，而且眼皮不會閉攏。你學到了這初步的工夫，我冉教你拉弓發箭的技術。</p>
<p>紀昌回到了家裏，暗暗地想，怎麼樣才能學到老師說的那一步工夫呢？恰巧他的妻子在布機上織布，機上牽動的棒，和機下踏脚的板；一上一下，不住地搖動。因此，想得了鍛鍊目力的方法。他就仰臥在這座布機底下，睜著兩眼，瞧那牽棒和踏板。當牽棒和踏板引到他的眼睫毛上，起初有些難受，二年以後，習慣成了自然，便毫不覺得。就是極鋒利的錐尖，刺到他的眼邊，眼珠也不會轉動，眼皮也不會閉攏了。</p>
<p>紀昌學到了這步工夫，很喜歡地去見飛衛，他以爲就可以學習拉弓發箭的技術了。不料，飛衛對他說道：「早啦，你只學到眼珠不動，眼皮不閉，還沒有練成眼光。你須得把極小的東西，越看越大，極細的東西，越看越明。你學到了這第二步工夫，再來見我。」</p>
<p>紀昌只得再回到家裏，想了些時，又想出練眼光的方法。他在牛尾巴上取了一根毛，縛住一個跳蚤，掛在窗口。他鎭日地張眼對牠望著。說也奇怪，十天以後，這細小的跳蚤，在他看來，覺得它的身體漸漸地擴大了。這樣，過了三年，克像車輪般大了。這時他也不去請教老師，拿起極小的弓箭，對準跳蚤射去，颼的一聲，恰恰射在跳蚤的心上。</p>
<p>於是，他去報告飛衛。飛衛很高興地對他說道：「好啦，你已經學得了射箭的秘訣，不用我再教啦！」</p>
<h3 id="c164">蚯蚓 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>每天早晨，敏兒時常看見在草地上，有一粒粒的泥土堆積着，他覺得很奇怪，走過去看看，到底是什麽東西？他看見一粒粒泥土旁邊有一個小孔，不知道這是什麼動物的洞？</p>
<p>『聰哥，那邊的小洞，是不是螞蟻洞』？</p>
<p>『不，那一粒粒的泥土，實在不是泥土，而是蚯蚓的排洩物，那洞便是蚯蚓所打的洞』。</p>
<p>『噢！原來是蚯蚓洞。農夫們說它是吃農作物的根，所以時常把它去餵鴨，爲什麽自然書裏說是有益於農作物的呢』？</p>
<p>『農夫們誤認它是有害的動物，其實它是吃那落下來的樹葉，並不吃農作物的。它能把土壤翻鬆，使空氣中的氧和氮容易到十壞裏去，因爲植物的生長，必須要有這氣體，能把瘠土漸漸的變成肥十』。</p>
<p>『聰哥，蚯蚓我是時常看見的，但它的構造，是不是很複雜的呢？它有沒有嘴巴和眼睛』？</p>
<p>『蚯蚓喜在潮濕的洞土中生活，它一共有一百四十環節左右，第十四，十五，十六三環節，叫環帶，顏色是很淡的，其餘的各節，腹面是淡紅色的，背面是褐色的。要知道它那兒是頭？那兒是尾？近環帶的是頭，否則，便是尾了。它的嘴像辦狀，很小的，必須放大了，才能看見。不過它沒有眼睛，可是它的皮層能辦別光的强弱。也沒有耳朶，所所它的聽覺是不靈敏的。更奇怪的是沒有雌雄的分別，於是便成雌雄同體了』。</p>
<p>『有人說：「蚯蚓唱歌，有雨不大」。哥哥，蚯蚓是不是能唱歌的』？</p>
<p>『這是俗語相傳，完全不確實的，蚯蚓的所以能唱歌。都是人們的誤會，其實是螻蛄在叫』。</p>
<h3 id="c165">秋蟲游藝會 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>秋天一半已過去了，各種秋蟲都活躍異常，在一個極美麗，花草極茂盛的花園裏，有一隻蟋蟀，遇着了一隻搖紗郎，說道：「光陰好快呀！秋天一大半已經過去了，我們的生命沒有多大時光　以活了，我們爲何不趁這個機會，邀幾個同伴，開一個「秋蟲游藝會·」這豈不是極有趣極快樂的嗎」？搖紗郎說：「我工作得很苦惱，也正要尋尋快活，我很贊成，明天約幾個朋友就實行罷！」蟋蟀笑道：「好！好！明天一定實行。」</p>
<p>「到了那天早晨，蟋蟀邀請了幾　同類，和苿莉子天的鈴，聒聒兒，叫哥哥，蚱蜢等，搖紗郎也邀了幾個，熾布娘，蜻蜓，蟬，蝴蝶，蛾，等·會塲的布置，是天然的，而且是在極美麗的花園裏，所以不需得再去布置，因此，蟋蟀，搖紗郎等並不費力，在當日九時就開始遊藝會了。螳螂螞蟻等做客串。</p>
<p>噹！噹！噹！……時已敲九下了·由蟋蟀瞿瞿叫了幾聲，表示要開遊藝會了，席上來賓，有蚯蚓，蜜蜂，蒼蠅，蚊子，蜈蚣，螢火蟲，等等，不一刻，只聽得天的鈴，的鈴，的鈴，開始奏樂了，會塲秩序，就寂寞無聲了，接着天的鈴停奏了，苿莉又的齡，的鈴，奏得更幽雅更悅耳，同時，穿着極美麗極漂亮的蝴蝶女土，一雙一雙，押着音樂調子，上下飛舞，身輕如燕，使得看客個個叫好。蝴蝶舞蹈完畢，就有蜻蜓出來表演，航空技術，在天空中左盤右旋，作捉蟲種種姿態，更邀同幾個同伴，排成品字式，作轟炸飛機之狀，表演得更是精妙，鼓掌之聲不絕，再由螞蟻比賽五百米，一百米的賽跑，蚱蜢跳高比賽，後來有客串螳螂起來試了一回短刀，接着由蟋蟀表演角力，一隻黃色蟋蟀，一隻黑色蟋蟀，大家雄糾，氣昂昂，露牙鼓翼，如臨大敵，準備角力，先由黑色的向黃色的進攻，於是左働右突，忽進忽退，不分勝負，各叫一聲而畢，搖紗郞，移里！移里！搖了一回紗，織布娘咿呀！咿呀！織了匹布，就算完了。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們看了「秋蟲遊藝會」以後作何威想？如果眼熟的話，回去不妨也去開一個「秋季遊藝會」。</p>
<h3 id="c166">鐵匠 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>一天，敏兒吃了晚飯，到大街上去買東西，跑到一家鐵匠店，有三四個鐵匠，忙忙碌碌地在那裏打鐵。面上堆着許多的烏黑的炭灰；他們身上的汗，滾滾的似雨一般的流下，衣服齷齪不堪。因此，敏兒便問他們道：「你們的衣服爲什麼這樣的不淸潔？」其中一個鐵匠答道：「我們的衣服雖不淸潔，可是我們對於人類，却有很大的功勞。如縫工用的剪刀，木匠用的鋸，鉋等，都是我們血汗的結晶品。」</p>
<p>敏兒聽了他的話，覺得很有理由；又想到他們的職業，雖然卑下，但是他們的功勞，却是何等的偉大啊！小朋友們，希望你們成人後，一定要做有益於社會的事，不要做無益於人類的職業，那才不致有愧於鐵匠哩！</p>
<h3 id="c167">青蛙和射魚 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 以德</p>
<p>在熱地方的一隻靑蛙，站在河岸上，自鳴得意的「啯啯啯」的叫個不了。它呌的意思，翻譯起來，就是說：我是靑蛙，我的榮譽，就是「益蟲」二個字，我會捉害虫，保五榖，我的功勞很大，誰能及得我！誰能及得我！</p>
<p>有一條「射魚」，聽了靑蛙的叫聲，很不耐煩，就游在水面上，對靑蛙道：「喂！我已知道你是靑蛙，是會捉害蟲的益蟲：但你可知道我嗎？」</p>
<p>靑蛙立刻停止了呌聲，看了看「射魚」，驕傲地答道：「我知道你的，我知道你不過一條平常的魚吧了！」</p>
<p>射魚道：「你可知道我的名字嗎？你可知道我的本領嗎？」</p>
<p>靑蛙仍是驕傲地道：「我並不是動物學家，怎會知道你這種無名小卒呢！不過你的本領，我是知道的，你會游水是不是？你知道嗎？我會水裏游，陸上跳，並且還會捉害蟲哩！請你不要說你的本領吧！」</p>
<p>射魚聽了這話，忍着氣答道：「你不要誇口！你會捉害蟲，我也會捉害蟲，你是益虫，那我就是益魚。——請看我的本頒」！</p>
<p>這時候，恰好有了害蟲飛過來，射魚立刻從嘴裏像噴水泉似的射出水來，直射到三四尺高，把那個害蟲射落，一口吞進吃了。</p>
<p>射魚吃進了害蟲，說道：「你看我的本頒怎樣？我應不應該稱做益魚？但是我是不愛虛榮的。我雖然天天射害蟲吃，却沒有人來稱我益魚，在我毫無關係。我最不愛看的，就是驕傲的態度，現在，就請你離我的眼前吧！」說着，又從嘴裏像噴水泉似的射出水來，對着靑蛙，把靑蛙射得滿頭是水。靑蛙覺得又濕又痛，連忙逃走。</p>
<h3 id="c168">水底點燈 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 郭善靄</p>
<p>小朋友：你看了這題目，心裏有些懷疑吧？我相信你一定會這樣的說：水底那裏能够點燈呢？若是點燈的話，那水不要把燈浸滅了嗎！不錯：水是能够把燈浸滅了的，我們可用科學的方法來制服它。</p>
<p>小朋友：你們想作這個游戲，祇須備火一盒，短蠟燭頭一支，玻璃杯一隻，比玻璃杯口徑稍大些的小木板一塊；面盆一隻，（裏面須裝滿了水）上列的東西都齊備了，你們就可開始來玩。玩時：先將蠟燭燃着，（燭心須剪短些）把他的油滴些到木板的上面，使木板和燭連接起來。然後，再將木板放到面盆裏的水面上，這時。你可把玻璃杯倒過來拿在手裏，端端正正的照在燭和木板的上面，用力把它壓進水底去，你看這燭在水裏，不但和在外面一樣的燃着，反因水的波盪，顯出許多很美麗的光耀來。</p>
<p>原理　空氣，是氣體的「實體」，他在天地間無論什麽處所，什麽物質，只要有空隙的地方，他都要攅到，也能佔相當的「空間」·我們把杯子壓進水底去的時候，這杯子裏面，早已充滿了空氣；所以面盆裏的水，一點兒也不能攢進去，水不能够攅進去，那燈就可如常的在杯裏的空氣燃中着。</p>

<p>伊正在說着，我却支在一張翅膀上，撑起一些，吃得津津有味。那斑鳩一動不動的棲止在那裏，很憐憫似的瞧着我。同時伊見我很疲乏的，向四下裏瞧，伊就明白我是渴極了。有一滴雨恰是昨夜滴在一片海綠草上；伊便用俘的嘴輕輕地把這滴雨啜了起來，帶過來送到我的口中，鮮潔得什麽似的。當然囉，要不是我跌傷了身體，像伊這樣很有身分的人，决不肯這樣待我的。</p>
<p>我那時還不知道什麽呌做愛情，但是我的心跳得十分厲害。我受了感情的衝動，是有一種說不出來的快樂，我瞧伊們倆，又美麗，又溫柔，在侍候着我，我願意永遠的像這般用着早餐，可是任何的事情都有一個結束的，便是一個病人的胃口也是如此。我旣用完了早餐，我的氣力早已恢復，，爲的要滿足那小喜鵲的好廳心起見，就將我的惡運說與伊聽，眞像昨夜對那鴿了所說的一樣的誠懇。那喜鵲非常注意的聽我說，那斑鳩更隨時對我表示伊的好感。但我剛說到自幼兒不知道我是甚麽東西的話。那喜鵲就呌起來了？「你可是設笑嗎？你是一頭山烏！你是一頭鴿子！呵！呵！這個都不對，你是一頭喜鵲，我的親愛的孩子，你實在是一頭喜鵲—並且是一頭很美麗的喜鵲。」伊將伊的翅膀向我微微一搧，好像是煽着一柄羽扇一樣。</p>
<p>我答道：「但是我的伯爵夫人，在我瞧來，我的顏色確是很像一頭喜鵲。請你恕我放肆，說出這樣的話夾：…」</p>
<p>喜鵲忙道：「一頭俄羅斯種的喜鵲，吾愛，你是一頭俄羅斯種的喜鵲！你不知道他們本來都是白色的嗎？可憐的孩子，你是何等的不解專啊！」</p>
<p>我答道：夫人，但我是生在麥萊地方一隻古舊的破碗中的，怎麽會變做一頭俄羅斯種的喜鵲呢？」</p>
<p>「啊！親愛的核子！你也是一頭低血種；你以爲只有你一個是如此嗎？一切有我在　裏，我呌你怎樣做，你就怎樣做；此刻我帶着你一同去，把這世界中最好的東西給你瞧。」</p>

<p>田徑塲人山人海</p>
<p>昨日下午三時、香港與廣東作足球錦標比賽、先一塲爲馬來亞對上海之足球第三四名决賽、四隊健兒、重試脚頭、龍爭虎鬭、風雲變色、江灣道上、盡是觀戰球迷、熱鬧人數更突破前日之紀錄、田徑塲圍得水洩不通、由南京蘇州等處遠途前來參觀之學校團體、亦不下數千人、吳市長親自奔走、指揮軍警維持秩序、各級門票、上午早已售賣一空、盛况誠空前未有、會師結果、香港以球王李惠堂之力、單人匹馬攻陷三球、以三比一戰勝廣東、奪獲本屆大會足球錦標、馬來亞亦以三對一勝滬、上海獲本屆大會足球第四名、廣東與馬來亞隊原定今日上午九時會戰、以决亞軍、但廣東昨已聲明棄權、不再比賽、馬華乃不勞獲亞軍、廣東第三、</p>
<h3 id="c174">腳頭錯過機會　上海再遭挫敗　二次罰十二碼球不中　屈居本屆足球第四名 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>前日上海與廣東之戰、競爭劇烈、內衛李寗以是傷脚、戴麟經李義臣亦以失之遲緩、爲人詬病、咋乃變更陣綫、以許景成、賈幼良爲左右翼、陳家球、鍾勇森爲內鋒、少年新進、勇敢活潑、而以老成持重之孫錦順爲中鋒、率領三軍、果然面目一新、緊凑可觀、咋日下午一時、上海與馬來亞開始接觸、陳家球·賈幼良·許景成三將、最爲活躍、但以球運不佳、滬隊數獲角球機會、陳家球遠射近攻、均未中的、滬軍氣勢銳不可當、馬軍球乃成終矢之的、混戰二十分鐘、未有勝負、</p>
<p>球運不佳　空勞心力　滬左翼許景成最爲賣力、沿邊深入、迅遠有力、數次盤過防衛綫、距門十餘碼處、舉脚力射、終以球運不佳、相差尺寸之間、空勞心力、第二十五分鐘時、滬又罰角球、落點極佳、鍾勇棒獲球、强門斜飛一脚、羣以爲必中無疑、不料竟被守門撲地救出、萬千觀衆、同聲浩嘆、戰事由是益趨劇烈、</p>
<p>觸手被罰　馬華勝球　戰至第二十八分鐘、馬軍內鋒李義耀、盤球進攻、傳與謝慶福、陳鎭祥迎頭搶救、在二十碼左近不幸手臂觸球犯規、由謝主踢、一脚向球門直射、球急如流矢、守門張榮才狠命躍起、已將來球抱住、不料李義耀挺身衝門、張榮才心慌意亂、偶一鬆手、球已飛越門界、進門綫僅祇半球、急返身拍出、而裁判執法如山、已宜告馬華獲勝、首開紀錄、</p>
<p>圍攻未下　軍心渙散　滬軍旣失一球、全綫下令反攻、五鋒左右衝突、肉搏進動搖狀態、鐘勇森·陳家球·孫錦順·許景成均獲攻門最好機會、但以守門經騐豐當手腕靈活、救出險球不少、圍攻旣久、始終未下、馬華球門、無時不在驚風駭浪之中、如獲天佑、終得化險爲夷、滬軍疲勞渦甚、行動漸趨遲緩、似有渙散之象、首塲即以一比零告終、勝利歸於馬華、</p>
<p>十二碼球　二隻不進　休息後、易地再戰、滬軍經嗎啡針之注射、稍有振作、開戰甫五分鐘、滬五鋒衝過二道防綫、短兵相接、正在混戰中、馬內衛以手觸球、判罰十二碼任意球、孫錦順主路踢、羣衆歡呼、以爲可以戰成平局矣、不料球發和緩、着地滾去、守門臥虎撲　羊式接住來球、咸大爲失望、羣謂孫錦順賣交情、未三分鐘、滬又獲罰十二碼球、改陳家球主踢、狠命一脚、砲彈般飛向球門、不料守門又將球輕輕接住、滬鋒趕往爭奪、守門拋球未遠、許景成再來一脚、亦未中的、眞是天亡滬也、</p>
<p>鄧華還罰　再勝一球　俗語說得好、禍不單行、果然於第十六分鐘時、滬方亦被罰—二碼球、謝慶福主踢、與地平綫成三十度角度從容進網、成二比零、出入之間、勝負已定、戰至第二十五分鐘、馬軍主罰角球、姚勝華傳與謝慶福乘亂軍中、舉起腳頭、又來一個、成三比零、滬軍已入第二期肺勞、陷於不可救藥地步、</p>
<p>鐵腿奏功　免吃鴨蛋　滬軍在垂頭喪氣中、勉強應戰、幸在第二十七分鐘時、機會圳臨、賣幼良孤軍闖過重圍、在門前急傳與孫錦順、距門僅五六碼、輕揚一腳、射落網內、免吃鳴蛋、總算恭喜、至是馬軍防守益嚴、此往彼來、麐戰許久、終無所獲、下半塲二比一馬華勝、總分三比一、在沈嗣良報告上海得足球錦標第四位中、結束戰事、</p>
<p>攻門機會　滬多於馬　昨日馬滬之戰、上海攻門機會、實較馬來亞爲多、計全塲共有最佳攻門機會二十五次、僅獲一球、殊太不應該、馬來亞有攻門機會十七、獲三球、其射球命中率、確較滬隊爲高、滬前鋒勇敢有餘、謀略不足、盤球至門前更欠鎮靜、失敗固屬分內事、但球運不佳、亦應有相當之原諒也、</p>

<h3 id="c175">顯出全身解數　球王力獲三球　遠射近攻咸得心應手　粵軍在最後扳回一分 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>昨日下午三時、香港與廣東足球錦標决賽、雙方勢均力敵、精采白出、戰事異常劇烈、無時不在驚險狀態之中、頭頂脚盤、轉瞬間往返異數、萬千觀眾目迷心眩、搖首咋舌、面部表情、極喜怒哀樂之致、球王李惠堂威風不减當年、獨力攻拔三球、球迷欣喜欲狂、鋼門包家平、在守字上、用盡平生力量、博得一片掌聲、其次若港左翼鄭季良、粵內鋒楊水益、陳鎮和球藝純熟、均由觀衆激賞、</p>
<p>廿碼遠射　球王奏功　三時正、銀笛高鳴、戰幕展開、爲表示決賽隆重起見、特請吳市長行開球禮市長撥球正對港方、黎紹榮接個正着飛越而前、雙方交戰、互有往返、粵軍嚴密監視球王、頗少活動機會、至第五五分鐘時、李惠堂獲球、一刹那間越過防綫、舉脚猛攻、角度稍側、出綫未中、至第二十分鐘、黃水康手臂悞網球判罰、其地距球門約十碼左右、李惠堂主踢、塲內外咸料李必派司左翼、不料砰然聲中、球並飛入網、粵軍驚惶失色、守鬥目定口呆、全塲觀衆拍手狂呼、成讚美球王身手、確非同小可也、其射球姿勢之美麗、進網之淸晰可觀、手腕腳勁非球王莫辦、</p>
<p>鋼門救球　厥功偉大　粵軍氣功激烈、楊小益、李鴻淸、陳鎭和拼命進擊、數度在港隊門前混戰、包鋼鬥左右上下應付、拳繫手摔、得心應手、港隊獲勝、網門球王、功績平均、第三十分鐘時、粵右翼在防衛綫內獲球、內剛猛攻、在萬分危急狀態中、包家平撲地拍球出界、逼成角球、全塲狂呼、譽謂較鐵門周賢言更高一等、未一分鐘、咨三鋒連人帶球衝出球門、包已將接住、但來勢兇猛、不及避讓、抱球倒地、從亂軍脚縫中拋球出險、誠臨難不亂、絕頂聰明者也、</p>
<p>再顯身手　二唱凱歌　粵軍以鋼門之阻梗、無法飛渡、攻勢漸趨琉懈、港軍曹桂成亦迭次　門出綫戰况沉寂、至第四十分鐘、港黎兆榮傳球與李惠堂、球王在三面敵人包圍下、以最矯提之身手、殺開一條血路、在十五碼處斜飛一脚、球又中的、連獲二球、重唱凱歌、球王萬歲、震動耳鼓、茲綬鄭季良、曹桂成二度遠射近攻、均出界綫、首傷戰事亦於以告終、二比零、廣東敗北、</p>
<p>變更陣綫　無能爲力　首塲中途港李國威受傷、易以楊本漢、尙能稱戰、休息時間中、粵軍變更戰略、最初因前日內衛麥紹漢受傷、爲鞏固後防計、內調譚江柏、而以何佐賢任中鋒、攻的方面力量驟弱、下半塲復以譯江柏任前鋒、以謝奎替補後衛、改取攻勢、終以鋼門難越、殊未能回頹勢、易地開戰之初、粵軍和排山倒海而來、侵入港方陣地、五鋒輪流衝攻、均未能得手、第三分鐘、粵主罰角球、陳鎭和未俟球至、先踢守門、裁判鳴笛判罰甫畢、球亦打入網內、遂宣告無效、</p>
<p>球王三勝　聲勢奪人　第六分鐘時、鄭季良獲球、以飛毛腿功夫、深入腹地、敵軍趕到、急傳與李惠堂、球王賦間已久、有此良機、豈肯放過、三番五次盤過敵營、乘空猛射一球、彈入球門、三戰三勝、聲勢奪人粵軍相觀失色、未幾王又得球飛進、守門早事戒備、砰然聲中、方被接住、此爲球王第一次之失脚、</p>
<p>黑炭勇猛　引起糾紛　小黑炭陳鎭和、最爲勇猛、惟失之過火、因搶球、黃算順俟會、小有爭執、一部份坐在東司令台下面地上觀衆、忽有五六人闖進塲內、意圖帮毆、經勸阻始止、吳市長親自巡視一週、警衛軍調往維持、始獲無事、繼續比賽、但雙方球昌興趣銳减、戰爭亦因以弛緩、</p>
<p>馬馬虎虎　扳回一分　第二十五分鐘時、港軍全取守勢、小黑炭率領三軍勇猛進攻、包鋼門亦網開一面、馬馬虎虎、由陳鎭和緩緩射進一球、扳回最寶貴之一分、未吃鴨蛋、至是港軍益小心應戰、節節退讓、球王在中綫外、袖手旁觀、一度闖入麥陣、與譚江柏互衝倒地、多年老友、扶起一笑、未幾銀笛聲中，戰事告終、下半塲一比一、總分三比一、香港獲本屆足球錦標、</p>

<p>南京與河北二籃球隊、於昨日下午三時舉行奪標賽、一般人事前推測、以南京擁有遠東名將唐寶堃李震中輩、幷集國體軍校之精銳、奪標希望較濃、豈料四十分鐘劇戰結果、南京隊柱石李震中、半途被罰下塲、該隊失却重心、遂以三十七對四十五之比、慘被河北淘汰、鏖戰詳情如後、</p>
<p>唐寳堃　一鳴驚四座　裁判舒鴻、鳴金擇位後、兩軍劇戰開始、雙方小心翼翼紀錄久久未開、李震中中圈跳球、傳與寶堃、三步當作兩步、李紹書餓虎撲食、小唐單臂一揚、紀錄首開、王後衛搶球犯規、王有才罰球中的、繼而李震中白步穿楊、輕輕一托、手及籃圈、吳文忠得寶堃優美之待遇、亦告得功、紀分板十、高高以八對居先、河北急要求暫停、休息後聲勢遂震、則寶成身材高大、籃下托進二隻、王鴻斌遠射命中、小李二次犯規、河北隊趕成—二對十三、</p>
<p>李震中　傷心離戰地　戰雲正緊之際、小李　子翻身、又超出、不料阿李又吿侵人、紀分曾手伸四　李將軍搖頭嘆息、忍痛離開戰塲、河北軍乘虛而入、王子恒首先報捷、成各十五平等、徐兆熊繼起立功、分數一路領前、則中鋒無人擋　、任所欲爲、由二十對十六、而至二十三對十七、唐寶堃心頭火起、使出當年本領、遠待進投、收復一城、河北隊亦投桃報李、絲亳不讓、上半時結果、河北仍二十五對二十佔先、</p>
<p>河北隊　奪得錦標歸　南京隊自震中離塲以後、全賴寶堃一人支持門戶、指揮三軍、繼續應戰河北軍抱奪棲雄心、一步不肯放　、再戰後、則寶成又加上兩球、二王均而所獲、遂以三十四對一十多獲一打之數、小唐見形勢危殆、進攻無門、改用遠對、吳文忠蕭規曹隨、分數又漸趕上、不料長淸犯規、河北隊增加二分、唐再度遠投、造成四上對卅至南京僅輸五分、看看將要趕上、不料時間己至、河北隊再獲數分後、鑼聲一響、冀軍遂擊敗堅强之南京隊、奪得錦標歸、</p>
<p>該戰事　不堪話白門　昨日南京隊失敗之大原因、故由於李震中之被罰離塲、使該隊失去聯絡、惟該隊之行軍遲緩、亦爲失敗主因之一、按行軍固須鎭靜、然鎭靜過度、亦嫌不及、故該隊雖抱緊守慢攻、長期抵抗之决心、但時間有限、終成千古之恨、惟小唐出神入化之技術、實不能因該隊失敗而應滅、餘子均庸庸碌碌、態度失常、河北隊以快硬見稱、前鋒二王、聯絡極佳、時以短兵進襲、到手即報、不假思索、劉寶成天賦身材、佔盡便宜、李羅二衛、亦克盡厥職、前鋒得其助力不少、倘該隊再求深造、不難成一遠東之强隊也、</p>

<p>女排球錦標、本屆各隊淘汰之結果、上海廣東冤家相見、競爭甚烈、結果上海以三對一獲勝、錦標在握、大家於嬉皮笑臉中終塲、上海隊排球、男女皆利、其亦時勢之英雄歟、比賽詳情如下、</p>
<p>戰書初下　即起殺心　本屆排球形勢、滬粵對峙、早成定案、惟複賽　中順湖南崛起稱雄、香港鍜羽歸去、仰於意料中稍出預算、但此爲各人命運所定、事勢上亦無能爲力、咋日下午三時、滬粵兩隊出塲、裁判員黃文建約法三章、講定陣地、即下戰書、上海並不客氣、程洪生發球、對粵隊並不以遠道來賓、稍事禮讓、連得六分、廣東楊查芬、氣不甘服、以其人之道、還治其身、於是一煞那間、頓成混亂局面、已越過上海小姐之紀錄、以十一比八換塲、轉過塲地、先時各有得失、並無軒輊、滬隊王謙發球、廣東正贏得起勁、稍不措意、局勢即變、土謙再度發很、黃杏芬策應托球、地位適中、兩翼力殺、居然成功、比數爲廿一對十八、上海先勝一局、</p>
<p>吶喊助威　粵成平局　旁觀度上、人數愈集愈多、各好其好、吶喊無已、喉嚨難啞、興緻甚高滬粵兩隊女將軍、各曾經過大戰、聲色貨利、無一足動、惟各以實力自視、粵隊發球、疾急流利、上海亦有反攻、彼此未受軍創、廣東羣衆、鄉土觀念至重、於高球來時、輒於塲外指示途徑、「一排」、「二排」、「三排」、使粵　應付多一考慮機會、從此扶搖直上、竟以少廿一對十六勝上海、打成一比一之平手、</p>
<p>馬不停蹄　上海再勝　三局起手、上海隊於陳　　鬼臉暗示之下、大張旗鼓、張湘萍杏芬旣須顧前、又要瞻後、馬蹄得得、足不稍停、線　珠獨擋重關、如鐵屏障身、粵隊雖有楊玉瓊顔秀容之猛殺、亦未見功效、上半塲上海已得　一分、而羊城女兒、當僅六分、大勢之去、觀衆莫不爲危、孰知虛虛實實、得進反退、原屬兵法上應有之程序、粵隊利用此着、乘滬隊乘勝輕敵之時、一鼓作氣、反以十九對九佔上風、上海小姐、到此地步、方悔當初之失於大意、立時各個振作精神、拼死火併、使粵隊中原腹地、無一片清靜土地、刧後餘天、於是終　收拾、滬隊十九、粵隊尙僅十四、洎後楊玉瓊再起力殺、亦僅弩末之上、勿能挽救大局於萬一、以十九對廿一終塲、上海由勝、</p>
<p>太陽照眼　滬隊成功　四局、廣東以如能人力勝天、扳回一局、則後路再有好戰可做、否則一世英名、葬身何地故鮑以微發球、即咬緊牙關、準備力四門、一球出手、響獲應心、果然一鳴　人、以十一比六勝上半塲換過局面、進步緊迫、乃十九對十五時、滬隊以連續迅速之射球、傳托劈殺、雖用力不大、而已眼花手亂、爲滬隊追成平手、兵來將擋、危險非常、結果粵隊以太陽西射、照眼耀閃、乃卒爲滬隊連勝二分、以廿比七二失去要隘、女排球錦標、遂亦以太陽而鑄成大錯、供手讓與上海、繼續稱覇、比數爲三對一、</p>
<p>雙方球藝　一般觀察　總觀兩隊球　、廣東能攻而不能守、故一遇大敵、略有阻擋、即陷窘况、顏秀容楊玉瓊係天殺星、但爲亂世之英雄、而非治世之能臣、可共患難、而不可安樂者、三排少聯絡、不耐收拾殘局、其敗之由、此爲最大、上海聯絡功夫、嘆爲觀止、惟殺球無力、且方法不佳、故進展不速、今錦標雖得、似猶須有充份之時間、以力事殺球之訓練也、</p>

<p>七局結果二十六對九　大會標錦隊威震滬濱</p>
<p>中西女子壘球比賽西僑對山東、於虹昨日下午三時半正式交鋒、西僑隊爲英美在滬僑民僑所組織、平日除特別從事於練習外、幷時向各方挑戰、以資觀摩披術、現全運會女子壘球冠軍爲山東、西僑隊特向我冠軍挑戰、山東爲百戰百勝之師、任何强敵、亦所不懼、乃慨然允戰、兩隊交鋒後、甚爲激烈、終西僑隊技術較差、大遭慘敗、</p>
<p>一棒示威　山東雖爲大會寇軍、今遇西僑、不得不謹愼應戰、初交手首由西僑取攻、二昌輪擊、先後皆死於山東技手之下、第三人拚命一擊、球在天邊、循壘而告生還深使魯隊膽寒、結果第一局得一分、</p>
<p>還她顏色　山東反攻小心翼翼、略試棒頭、不料第一棒即交張慕霞擊出、球越中野、無法覓得、跑者欣然荷棒生還、嗣山金志範輪擊、第一棒又效法前人、在萬衆喝采聲中、捧腹而返、西僑小姐均赫得面如土色、</p>
<p>臂力如虎　戰事繼續、魯方連續得分、西僑投手、爲挽救大局、大顯身手、數次善投、殺死二人、勢略轉、不過魯復力攻二分、第一局八分吿結、嗣於二三七局中、山東賴其擊球工夫之超越、仍獲分甚多、西僑無心抵禦、</p>
<p>背城一戰　西僑巾幗爲車恥復仇、立下决心、背城一戰、自第三局起、投手開始內曲球投射、左百無一失、尙未鑄成大錯、山東倫壘暗攻之計、皆爲接手所破</p>
<p>外翼不固　每局中西橋外翼技術欠佳、高球多空落、內之使山東機會愈多、倖於第七局西僑擊運亨通、連攻四分、雖未能　復仇、大體尙屬可觀、兩隊友誼賽乃於暮角蒼茫中閉幕、</p>

<p>男子網球單打决賽、於昨日下午一時舉行、對壘者爲爪哇許承基與上海邱飛海、許爲靑年健將、球藝高超、舉國皆知、自出戰以來、憑其優美之技能、一再挫强　、邱爲網球宿將、沂以年高體弱、球技日見退化、惟昨日戰來、尙可過去、其底綫長抽、每予許極大之威脅、博得掌聲不少、結果許以直落三繫敗老邱、榮　冠軍、尙有林寶華對錢耀彬之落選賽、錢棄權、列第四名、林邸兩人、原定今晨九時作亞軍之爭、但兩人同屬滬市、兄弟鬩牆、勝負難下、惟以連日作戰、疲憊已極、而以上海立塲言、不論認勝誰收、總是第二第三、固與大局無關、故兩人同意、取消是戰、而作林棄權、於是邱爲亞軍、林居第三、决賽結果如左、</p>
<p>第一盤開始、許因昨日雙打慘收、决心雪恥、故即予老邱迎頭痛擊、大刀闊斧、旁若無人、老邱東奔西走、招架爲難、亳無反抗餘地、許竟以光盤獲勝、悽慘之至、第二盤老邱略有起色、其底綫長抽、架入兩角、且出球有力、許亦無法應付、以二比一佔優、但曇花一現、詐即加上兩局、反以三比二後來居上、邱竭力進攻、造成各三和局、然許臥薪嘗膽、不肯放鬆、其犀利之發球、美妙之截擊、　老邱束手無策、只能望球興嘆、於是一局復一局、連陞一級、以六比三再告勝利、最後一盤、許鋒芒益健、一鼓而下、連得四局、嗣因勝利在　、不事苛求、遂被老邱乘機反攻、奪回一局、不料老邱得寸進尺、連下一城、許見老邱老勁勃發、若不稍示顏色、勢將養癮爲忠、星火燎原、故亦加上一局、以五比二遙領前茅、下　邱發球、許極有獲勝之機會、總囚操之過急、幾次高壓、均成野比、結果反爲邱得、成五比三、第九局詐發球、友券可操、遂於輕描淡寫中取得是局、以六比三凱旋而歸、榮獲單打冠軍、</p>

<p>— 宋如海</p>
<p>世界運動會、自西元一八九六年由法國男儔——葛划亭氏悉心規復後、洎今已三十八載矣、此三十八載之中、曾經舉行於歐美各國者凡十次、明年———一九三六年將在德國柏林舉行第十一屆世界運動大會、德國政府對該會籌備已在三年之前、計至現在已籌備三年之久了、並特爲大會建築新運動塲在柏林城外、如游泳池，體育館、足球塲、均從新規劃用極新式極精緻之圖案建築而成、又建築一「我能比呀村」Olympic　llagie專爲招待各國選手及來賓寄宿者、即此、可見德國政府對於本届大會塲地設施、招待佈置、異常周到、一事一物、均派專員分司其職、專責籌備、據美國參加世界運動會委員報告、以本屆世界運動會之設備、較比以往任何國之族備完善週密、令人聞之、不能不深佩德國民設以及德國人之對於體育各種方面、眞所謂「水銀瀉地、無孔不入」、在此一端亦可見其無微不至矣、</p>
<p>然在今日世界各國民族之中、誰都不能否認德國民族之强盛、是非較比任何民族爲最、而其强盛之原因、蓋有所由來、原其男女老幼上下莫不注重體育、視體育爲生命、幾若天生性成者焉彼等不但提倡侶·實行·舉辦·而已、且由政府特設全國最高主持體育行政之體育部與該國各部機關並比、派大員專司其責、統制全國體育事業以故收效宏而速也、</p>
<p>此溯自我國參加世界運動會、尙在第九屆起始、前幾乎未聞有此名而知有此事、雖有知者、亦甚少數、其時如海適留學美洲、以平日對體育有所性好、當蒙全國體育恊進會派爲代表參加、迨後在美國舉行第十屆世界運動、我國始正式派劉長春君出席參加、從此吾國對於世界運動始有相當認識、故本屆運動曾曾經教育部全國體育委員會議决多派選手出席參加如足球·籃球·田徑賽·淤泳·舉重等各項運動、已能如此然烈參加、未始非吾國體育之好現象也、</p>
<p>但如海有不能已於言者、則謹誠願望吾國政府亦效法德國之對於體育之設施、全國設立一最高體育行政之體育部、轄行政院、如教育·內政等部同立相等地位、簡派大員主持其事職司專責、規劃掌管統制一切體育事宜、以謀全國體育之進展、庶幾有效、如海曾披閱勤奮體育月刊二卷十二期中央大學體育教授程登科先生一對於我國新體育行政系統之建設」一文、以程先生所建議在教育·訓練·內政·三部之下共組國民體育委員會一節、以爲尙要更進一　、在行政院直轄設一體育部、應與各部相等、同其系統辦理、如德國今日之情形相若、豈不較共組國民體育委員會爲東得乎、同時史由黨　軍領袖以身作則、從自己提倡起、本身實行起、如德之希特勒、意之墨索利尼、除提出國民外、自身按日實行習勞運動、（如挖地種花等之有益於身心筋骨之運動、莫不爲之）、此正其例也、吾國上下果能有如此趨向、則今日之所急需亟應行者、厥爲由　府遴選派遺全國體育專家與素所提倡體育於體育有興趣者、前往歐美注重體育之各國、多事參考悉心觀摩、以資借鏡、而民族復興、端賴是焉、</p>

<p>汪院長十四日晚在招待全運會選手席上之演詞原文、茲探錄如下、主席諸君第六屆全國運動大會、自國慶日開會以來、已經數日、在這數日中、無論在會塲眼見的或從廣播裏聽見報告的異口同聲、都設從辦事的秩序及紀律看來、比上屆進步了、從各選手的運動成績、看來也比上屆進步了、這些進步是諸君努力所得的光榮、也是全國關心運動的人們所聞而欣慰的、全國運動大會開辦以來、至今只不過第六次、然而每次都有進步、這不僅足以表示諸君的努力、而且也足以表示全國人民、對於運動之竭力提倡十數萬觀衆的熱烈興奮的情緒、傳達到幾千運動員的耳目裏、鼓舞了諸君、不少的勇氣、知道社會對於諸君有無限的期待有無限的信託、諸君益自覺其責任之重大了、本來運動、是每一個人、每一個民族、每一個國家、都應共同努力的、尤其是在國難期間的我們、對於運動認爲是救亡圖存的一種重要工作、不能不加倍的共同努力常聽見說健全之精神、寓於健全之體魄、爲精神之健全計、誠然如此、即體魄本身計、其健全亦爲必要、因爲一切工作、不但要　全之精神去處理、也要健全之體魄去担當、例如打仗、如今用不着披鐵甲持大刀了、然而軍事動作也非孱弱的體魄所能禁受的、不但打仗爲然、一切機器雖可以代手工、一切交通用具、雖可代以機器、然不是體力强健手足靈敏的人、往往不能利用機器、而反爲機器所累、故此在這個世界內、每一個人不但從精神修養方面、要注意遝動以保特精砷之活潑健全、從全魄鍛鍊方面、也要注意運動、鍛鍊成鐵一般的身體、方纔足以當萬事、而排萬難、由此說來運動的意義、是在强種强國、而在國難期間運動的單孔　義、是在强種强國、以救亡圖存、全國人民、對於諸君熱烈興奮的情緒、其泉源在此、而諸君視運動爲神聖的義務努力、以赴其泉源亦在此、說到救亡圖有的工作、與運動的工作、不但有一貫的意義、而且方法和原則、也是一貫的、舉個例來說、運動的要義、是在自己努力、每一個運動員、都知道若要得到優良的成績、必須自己平日努力於練習、天下只有平時努力的人、臨時上塲因偶然的不幸而失敗的、决沒有平時不努力的人、臨時上塲、因偶然僥倖而勝利的、因爲如今的上塲、已不是從前八股時代的上塲、可以和中彩、一般得到僥倖了、除了拿出眞實本領來做確實比較、以獲得公道裁判、沒有其他方鈇救亡圖存的工作、何莫不然、兩國相遇、全恃實力以判優劣定勝敗、所以勝敗之數、不是决定於戰時、而早已决定於平時、在今日　　弱肉强食的世界裏種無倖存、國無倖存、欲求不亡、惟有自己預備實力、實力多預備一分、則生存之保障多一分、亡與不亡、以自已努力不努力爲斷、再舉個例來說、運動的要義、是在自己努力、而努力的結果、其進步是必然的、每一個運動員都知到自己努力、未必定能得到勝利、而自己努力、定然可得到進步、因爲我自己努力、別人也會自己努力、所以勝利是不一定有把握的、所以每一個運動員、如果欲求進步、惟有自己努力去練習、只能盼望自己有進步、不必盼望別人會到霉、</p>
<p>運動如此、救亡圖存的工作亦何莫不然、如今提倡救亡圖存的人、都知道說臥薪嘗膽、誠然非臥薪嘗膽不能救亡圖存、但是臥薪嘗膽、只能把握得住救亡圖存的工作、必有進步、而不能說必得勝利、因爲我們臥薪嘗膽、別人一樣也會臥薪嘗膽、越王勾踐臥薪嘗膽、而吳王夫差抱着四施荒謠逸樂、所以越王勾踐必能得到勝利、如巢吳主夫差一樣的臥薪嘗膽、那就不能說一定讓越王勾踐得到勝利了、如今世界强者努力於永久保持其强者的地位、不特此也、並目努力於使弱者永久處於弱者的地位、那麽、弱者如何敢說臥薪嘗膽的結果、定能得到勝利呢、然而勝利是不可必的、進步却是可必的、我們只有日日努力、以求進步因進步而得勝利、固然是我們的大願不然、心已盡力已竭、也就可以仰不愧於天俯不怍於人了、這是運動家安心立命的所在、也是救國者安心立命的所在、再舉個例來說、努力的結果、必然得到進步是無疑的、然而這種進步、是不是已經太遲了呢、拿運動來說、全國運動大會誠然是每次都有進步、但這種進步的成績、也只能就全國來說、得到安慰、若以我們全國運動大會的成绩與遠東運動大會的成績相較、那就要自愧不如了、若更進而與世界運動大會相較、那更是瞠乎其後了、這個緣故、是因爲我國提倡運動比別人遲了三四十年、在這三四十年中、別人早已進步向前、所以我們望着眞有望　莫及之苦、但這可怎麽辦呢、報道我們就灰了心嗎與其灰心、不如及時努力、我們只要檢點自己的成绩、知道每屆都有進步便可知道如果努力、必有進步、那麽、我們的努力、是有希望的、我們的進步、是有把握的、我們只要努力、我們便算盡了責任、遝動如此、救國何莫不然、自世界交通以來、有些國家已經以積弱之故、而奄然物化了有些國家受了刺戟、即時努力、已得佔得了强者的地位了，而我們的國家、不是弱小、也不是强夫、有一個特別的名詞是弱大、惟其大也、故生人歆羨、惟其弱也故恣人宰割、如今欲轉弱爲强、而政治經濟軍事文化樣樣落後了五六十年、即使欲及時努力、已經有措手不及之苦、但是除了及時努力還有什麼法子呢、我們不敢設努力便一定可以自存、而我們敢說不努力則萬無不亡之理、那麽祇有及時努力、只有及時加倍的努力、過去且不用說了、只有努力現在、努力將來、有好些人、無論白運動以至救亡圖存、對之往往有兩種心理、一種是太灰心了、以爲現在努力、萬萬來不及這種灰心的結果、必然自暴自棄、這是萬萬要不得的、還有一種却是太大意了　　、彼己之間觀察不清判斷不明自己柏有所得、便沾沾自足、其結果不度僄不量力終於自侮自亡、這也是萬萬要不得的、我們今日第一要知道國難當前、一息不容稍懈、第二要知道事在人爲、只問做不做、不必問成不成、决心要堅定、工作要有恒、時時刻刻的努力、時時刻刻的求得進步、一切運動作如是觀、一切救國工作也作如是觀、今晚略備組點邀請諸君、祝諸君的努力、祝諸君的進步、祝諸君的身體强健、個人强健、團體强健、國家民族於以强健、第六屆全國運動大會萬歲、中華民國萬歲、</p>

<p>上海足球籃球冠軍業已失却、故咋日决三四名時、足球隊中李義臣　麟經、藍球隊中陸鍾恩等、意志消沉、不願出塲、站在運動精神上設、未免太那個、</p>
<p>京冀决戰男籃球冠軍時、雙方均有啦啦隊之組織、門爭得很利害、河北隊說「河北好、河北好、河北籃球括括呌」、南京隊說「小意思、小意思、」連日球類好戲連台、滬上球迷、大飽眼福、惟籃球足球比賽時間衝突、大有不能洞觀全豹之嘆、門檻較精的、雙方各看半塲、</p>
<p>這幾天風勢不好、排球塲上毆打裁判、足球塲上觀衆之間亦大打出手、昨日足球塲上又發生毆打之事、這個年頭兒裁判員眞是耕做、</p>
<p>大會今將閉幕、單單位選手均賦歸去、宿舍中大家都在打舖蓋、景象倍甚悽慘、</p>
<p>昨日足球賽覜衆擁擠之一斑</p>

<p>會塲上紙帽大盛行</p>
<p>昨日天氣仍屬奇熱摩登姑娘都以傘避日、男子之未帶帽子者、均將報摺成帽子以減日威、因此會塲中之自製紙帽盛極一時、可謂比比皆是矣、</p>
<p>一封殿軍優哉游哉</p>
<p>當咋日千五百公尺自由賽於中途時、有第六道及第九道綫二選手、實力似乎差一些、到一千公尺時離開第一竟隔百公尺左右、一對殿軍、精神甚佳、繼續前進、並時時相對而笑、這是俊哉游</p>
<p>寧波老太說眞犯關</p>
<p>游泳池長途僅五十公尺、故參加千五百公尺之選手須來回三十次、確然甚難、記者席後面有一寗波老太、說「格·犯關·犯關·眞犯關、三十趟濃看了岩得來」、</p>
<p>姑娘俟曬苦哉苦哉</p>
<p>咋日姑娘們撑着傘看比賽、却把後方觀衆的視綫盡被遮沒、因此同聲大呼、「看不見了、請你們不要撑洋傘」、姑娘們只得收起洋傘俟曬、苦哉苦哉、</p>
<p>發令開槍急煞看客</p>
<p>于五百公尺賽、在最後五十公尺時、發令員開槍通告選手、急煞了看臺上的一位看客、他說「發令員爲什麽要這樣對準着他呢、子彈不是玩的、不要眞被他打着了啊」、</p>
<p>球王顯威迷哥唱彩</p>
<p>當廣東隊右內衛犯規、裁判决罰球、香港李惠堂者四十碼外一踢成功、李球王的是不凡、當球進網時、迷哥喝彩、聲浪滔大、某看客說「這到有球國皇帝威風呢」、</p>
<p>孫大貓亦精於籃球</p>
<p>大貓軏是田徑名將、但對於籃球亦甚精故咋日在籃球房北看臺中央靜坐覜戰、直到散塲後、始向田徑塲踱去、</p>
<p>河北啦啦有聲有色</p>
<p>咋日南京對河北男子籃球决賽、兩隊各有啦啦隊助威、爲之打氣、一舉一動令人捧腹、據說河北對啦啦隊組織曾加相當訓練、這主角一次海怪沒有來、不然還要精彩得多呢、</p>
<p>記者香伙趕和尙</p>
<p>咋日運動塲因有港粵足球决賽、一時田徑塲觀衆、實開開幕以來新紀錄、塲內草地上亦坐有數千外埠學生、記者席亦竟爲觀衆佔據、當二時進塲時、已無記者座位了、眞所謂香伙趕出和尙、</p>
<p>銅板是要銅錢買的</p>
<p>咋日港粵足球决賽時、一輩迷哥迷得神暈顚倒、看到精采處不管三七二十一、竟將手中銅板亂拋、弄得幾個看客頭破血流、會塲報告員得悉即報告道你們銅板是要銅錢買的、請不要亂拋」、</p>

<h3 id="c231">歡送全運會女選手們 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>女子在封建社會裏，是被幽禁在囚牢中的無期徒刑者，囚徒，當然不能希望有健康的心身的。所以「深居簡出，弱不禁風」是封建社會（上流社會）贊美女子的信條。</p>
<p>時代不同了，社會改變了。現在，女子旣可和男子同樣地赤身露體，跑跳於數十萬觀衆之前，顯示她的康健活潑的姿態與技術。不管遊於水，賽於陸，在在可和男子比美一時，然而我們的社會，究竟還是不三不四的半封建半殖民地資本主義化的社會。女子雖有的已跳出了囚牢，但依舊脫不了奴化玩化的地位，所以同樣的選手，女子所獲得的，却有另一種精美的頭銜，什麼「魚」呀「蝦」的；女選手們，你們也體味到其中的社會意義？這是榮譽呢，是恥辱？</p>
<p>本屆全運會開幕，適在意阿戰爭開始，中日密切提携之時，而地點却適在「一二八」的古（？）戰塲。女選手們！在此良辰（？）在此疆塲！你們在歡欣歡躍之餘，試遙望阿國婦女，她們不正在慷慨悲歌，隨軍參戰？而我們只在他人的手掌上，跑跑跳跳，歌歌唱唱，相形之下，誰有慚色？</p>
<p>女選手們，你們能跳出囚牢，能在那耗資百萬的偉大運動塲上，一顯身手，這是多麼幸運啊！然而你們若轉眼他方，隨處的洪水滔滔，那裏的男和女，飢寒難當，哀號遍野！和你們的「大家歡暢，歡暢，歡暢，歡暢（全運會歌詞句）的歌聲，遙相同響。有人說：「這方的綠水黃沙，是他方的碧血白骨啊，」歡暢？</p>
<p>集全國各地數一數二的健兒，一賽你能你强的塲台，榮膺冠軍的，誰不欽佩？誰不愛慕？她的微笑揚眉，誰能說「不當」？不過按照一般競賽者的心理，常是只希望自已獨勝，僥倖他人落後，假使把這種心理應用在日常處世對人上，就變成了自私自利的個人主義。人生的眞義决不是這樣，我們應該聯合並提携每個人，多能站在平等的生存綫上。</p>
<p>諸位可愛可敬的女選手們！認淸你們自身的地位吧，認淸你們所處的時代吧，認淸你們立着的塲所吧，看看你們周圍的大衆吧，確定你們今後的人生觀吧！你們將遠行了，寫此相勉！</p>
<h3 id="c232">關於「她的出路」 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇麗</p>
<p>看了本刊八十四期鐵懷先生詢求她的出路一文，腦海中也不斷的盤旋着這問題，因為這事誠如羅瓊君所謂「已不是畸形社會中的某一種畸形規象，而是已成為現社會中相當普遍的嚴重問題了」，正不知多少女子遭遇着同樣的不幸，所以婦女自身及關心婦運的先生們很急迫地需要檢討一下，指導許多被壓迫下的不幸女子的出路呢。</p>
<p>我們很欣幸，羅瓊君能詳細分析這件不幸的事，同時指點那不幸女子的出路，不過我對於羅瓊君的意見了還有一此祉充。</p>
<p>第一，我們知道乙女的被躝躝經確實的，在處置和應付甲男方面，她有著不可卸責的錯誤，但她的根本錯誤還是在於對現社會沒有正確的認識，始終是以「戀愛就是生活，戀愛就是一切」的人生觀，滿想度那賣淫式的寄生生活之溫柔好夢。所以明知甲和丙同居多年。但她希望甲能和丙脫離關係，換句話說，就是希望犧牲那和她同樣命運的丙女而獨佔甲；當她大腹便便時發現甲丁的關係，又希望犧牲丁女，使自己腹內的孩子，有個名正言順的父親，直到她發覺自巳受盡欺騙後，還是發出一會有人肯娶嗎一的疑問來，可見她對社會是絲毫沒有認識的。</p>
<p>現在甲男出走了，乙女無路可走了，羅瓊先生告訴她，應該將甲男當做敵人看待地澈底的淸算一下，不過我們已知道容許這事實的發生是男性中心社會，當然，現在的法律，現在的輿論，一切都偏袒男性的；那末乙女假使要淸算的話，甲男必然仍可運用他們所佔的優勢對付乙女，乙女在這種情形之下，會不會勝利？至於找職業罷、一個人為自已白生存，就是任何困難，也不曾寒心的，在認淸了賣淫式的寄生生活之不可靠後的她，雖小販苦力我敢說她决不會不去幹的，但退一步想，在經濟恐慌日益尖釵化的現代，怎樣滿意的職業當然找不到，而小販苦力是否就容易找得到？况目現在還是正在驅逐婦女回家的時候呢！即使說，乙女僥悻而找到了某一職業，那末她是否已在社會上取得獨立的地位，獲得經濟上的獨立了嗎？別忘掉在男性中心社會中，女子是沒有獨立人格的，女子始終是隸屬於男子被男子所操縱的。</p>
<p>那末乙女的出路究竟在那裏！</p>
<p>回答是：人是社會的動物，脫離社會而謀求個人的出路是不可能的，蹂躪女性，摧殘女性，是男性中心社會，在這社會卡改良之前女性是得不到獨立的人格；所以乙女以及許多被壓迫的被蹂躪的姊妹們，不應觀望和期待，為着解放自身和一切被壓迫同胞的束縛，抱着犧牲自己的精神，共同改革這不合理的社會制度，這才是眞正的出路。</p>
<h3 id="c233">活埋小孤孀 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 梅霖</p>
<p>—禮敎吃人在四川—</p>
<p>當我在離開這里（指四川德陽縣城外某村。德陽在成都以北一百二十幾里，是川北有名的大城）的前三天，我竟有機會目擊這慘酷的，原始社會的刑罰。而這個被犧牲者是一個女人，一個小孤孀。</p>
<p>今早我起身的時候，有一個妹妹跑來告訴我說，『蘋姐，今早要活埋一個人，在大宗祠前。』</p>
<p>什麼？「活—埋？埋誰」？我驚異地問。</p>
<p>「是的，那個小孤孀，族畏要把她活埋啦！」她說。</p>
<p>我聽了終不相信。我想這必是一種謠言。你想，在離縣城還不上一百五十里的地方，要是所謂法律還有一點兒效力的話，這樣慘酷的事實該不會出現吧。但立刻，我證實了小妹妹說的絕不是謠言。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：這小孤嬬本有一個丈夫，在某次大軍過境的時候被拉去充當伕役。於是她只得靠着自己那三畝薄田，撫養那六七歲的小孩過日。但她只有廿幾歲，於是就跟鄰右一位從堂的獨身漢，一個二十九歲的莊稼人發生了肉體關係等到這女人的肚子漸漸漲大起來的時候，村里就把這事情當作話題而有了非議了。當時族長曾親身到過她家，據說他—族長，曾提出這樣的條件：三畝薄田歸他，他則佯作不知任她逃走。可是她沒有答應，因為她外地沒有一個親人，而且要了他的田簡直就是要了她的命根。這時候那男人亦畏罪私逃了。這位女人亦把這事告訴人家，於是就觸怒了族長。最後經了族長出面疏通的結果，今早開了全族的會議。會中居然决定處罰她（罪名是敗壞門風！）這處罰的方式竟是活埋！竟是活鏗！</p>
<p>可惜我沒法參觀這審判的機會，看不見那些魔鬼們的醜態。據說他們稟告了祖先，說這女人怎樣敗鬥風、喪廉恥；接着還要這位被犧牲者向族長，向闔族的人叩頭道謝！自己認錯！自己願死！至於那個小孩子呢，亦判歸族長代為撫養，不消說他因此多了三畝田，還得了一個可供使喚的小丫頭。</p>
<p>以後，就是我親見的。他們在田裏掘好了一個三尺見方，四尺來深的井。鬆散的泥土堆在四周，旁邊還搕着一個裝滿石灰的筐子。他們把她同那小一女孩帶到這井邊來。</p>
<p>她有一付跟普通的農婦一樣結實的身體。當他被擁着到井邊時。我看她灰白的面色，像死魚似的一雙眼睛，同戰抖着的身子，蒼白的雙唇，雙手被反縛着。剛到井邊，她猝然暈到了。</p>
<p>他們用冷水噴她，我遠遠地看見她心房的跳動。</p>
<p>「娘呀……娘……呀」那小女孩拚命地哭着。那悲惻的聲昔在風中顯得格外凄厲。她似乎稍為淸醒了一點。眼請微微地張開。</p>
<p>「你有什麼話說沒有？」所謂族長的說，一面捋着他的長鬚。神色莊嚴而又鎮靜。她沒有回話。</p>
<p>「這是她自招的，是她自己願意的！諸位族人作證！」他說，用眼巡着四周。人羣都低着頭，沒有回話。他們亦用手巾同紗堵住了那小孩的口，小孩昏迷地跳着。</p>
<p>於是有人向井里撒下石灰。立刻，井口就　起一股極濃的白烟。在白烟中兩隻朝天的脚在舞動着，接着便沒有了蹤跡看的人，像看了一齣「猴兒戲」似地，若無其事地散了塲蕪</p>

<h3 id="c235">第六節　法律問題 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>婦女在公法及私法上要獲得與男子平等權利的問題，也是婦女問題的中心問題。例如婦女要求立法權及參政權，財產管理權及遺產承繼權，結婚擁及離婚權，私生兒的認父權，關於好通適用同等法律等等，都是從來婦女運動的主要綱領。</p>
<p>我們若要正確的理解這問題，則先有明瞭法律的本質的必要。</p>
<p>許多人以為法律是維護社會的公理與正義的東西，但這僅是皮相的觀察。實際上法律是替少數人壓制多數人的一種工具。關於此點，倍倍爾是很正確的指明出來！</p>
<p>一種族間階級間兩性間的從屬的地位，一定在國家的法律及政治上表現出來。一國的法律是支配階級的有利的組織的表規。因為婦女是被壓迫的服從的「性」，所以她們在法律上的地位也是如此。」（婦人與社會）</p>
<p>我們在歷史上看，希臘羅馬時代的法律是貴族及自由民壓迫奴隸的工具，封建時代的法律是少數領主及僧侶壓迫多數農奴的枷鎖，到了資本主義社會，法律雖則吸收一些所謂民主主義的精神，但仍然成為少數有產者支配多數無產者的鐵鞭！</p>
<p>法律在男女的社會的權利問題上也是同樣，很顯然的暴露牠的不合理的原形！在從來的男性中心社會，法律完全站在男子的立塲稱「道理」而使婦女去服從牠！換言之，法律便成了男子用以抑制婦女的符咒！特別在封建社會，婦女簡直是一件物件，法律不單不保護婦女的權利，反而更使男子壓迫婦女的權利神聖化，絕對化了！所謂三從四德七出等封建禮教，雖不就是刑典律令，但這使是一而用以剝奪女權，他而使男權神聖化的絕對的道德律，可是法律並不是固定不變的東西，牠是跟着社會的進化而進化！詳言之，社會的經濟基礎發生變化，則政治的，法制的上部構造也隨之變化到了資本主義社會，從自由主養及德謨克拉西思想反映出來的法律，自然和封建的絕對專制主養的法律不同，對於婦女要承認一人」的權利，這是婦女要求法律上與男子平等權利的基本動機！</p>
<p>男權社會承認婦女的「人的」權利，决不是偶然的，而是有實際的社會的根據。其最主要者，就是婦女自從工塲手工業時代以來能够同男子一樣參加社會的生產勞動，遂行國民經濟上主要的任務。法國大革侖時代所勃興的女權擁護運動也就是從如上的社會的根據出發的！</p>
<p>女權運動的法律國爭，在十九世紀中葉至末業，歐美諸國都有熱烈的實行，特別在英美兩國婦女要獲得立法權及參政權的關爭，便成了嚴重的娘兒們的暴動！這個結果，男權社會終於承認了男女在法律上平等的原則！但這僅是原則的承認而已！實際上能够享受法律上所認定的法律的婦女祇限於極少數的上層婦女，至於大多數勞苦婦女仍然享受不了何等法律的恩典！她們仍舊在所謂『自由』勞動契約之下不能不替資本家創造利潤！什麼遺產承繼權，參政權等等都和她們無關！</p>
<p>歐洲大戰以後，在世界上進入於文明段階的諸國幾乎完全承認婦女在法律上的權利，就是最落後的我們中國，也在國民黨黨綱中規定婦女的種種權利，於是許多女權主義者都以為在資本主義社會制度底下也有婦女在法律上獲得平等權利的可能，並且以為這是她們的勝利的表現！但在我們看來，這正是她們的幻想的表現，假使說，法律是經濟的支配權利的反映物，那末，在社會的經濟權力集中在少數男子手裏的社會，法律也只能成為少數男子的專有物，或者是他們所任意利用的工具！女權主義者們所獲得的勝利，决不是大多數婦女的勝利，而祇是少數上流婦女的勝利而已！</p>
<p>到了資本主義世界漸决進入法西斯蒂階段的現在，婦女在法律上平等的問題史受了嚴重的打擊！在德國希特勒執政以前有四十九名的女代議員，但到臉孔上台後把她們全體都趕回家庭裏去，現在是靑一色的男性議會了！意大利也是同樣，不準婦女在政治及法律機關參加活動，　這種傾向在目前資本文義各國正在方面興未艾，不單婦女的立法驃及參政權發生根本動搖，即使婦女的職業權及勞動權也將有被剝奪的危險！一世紀以來鬬爭過來的女權主養者們，將不禁「前功　廢」之感！</p>
<p>最後我們可以引出一個結論，所謂法律是社會的經濟基礎的反映，在社會的經濟權力集中在少數男人的資本主義社會，所謂男女平等的法律是不會存在的！祇有在人和人間，男子和婦女間沒有經濟的隸屬關係的社會，法律才成為人和人間的平等合理的契約，才能徹底的實現男女在法雜上平等的原則！</p>

<h3 id="c236">從「救救中學生」說到救亡教育 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 柳辛</p>
<p>陳衡哲女士在「獨立評論」上因調查小學兒童家長們對於現下學校敎育的意見，同時又發現了中學生們日以繼夜尚無以瞧付其繁重的工作，於是陳女士哀民族未來主人翁生命之被　喪，而發出「救救中學生」的呼聲。言出於衷，更加令人震驚。我所欽佩的是陳女士所提出的口號。「救救中學生」，但我要救中學生却是另有原因，因為我認為陳女士所看到的只是現下中學敎育的一面而不是全面。</p>
<p>我們承認敎育卽生活，敎育是生長，敎育旣不能敎育學生走上歧途，更不可敎育學生機成死人，所以欲揠苗而助長，這是愚妄人的見解。在敎育原理上，心理的發育與生理的發育應相一致，這差不多已經成為鐵則，若昧於這點，或促成學生早熟，或妨得其生理的健康，均可謂罪大惡極。但一究現下我國中學敎育的實際，無論關於課程方面，敎材方面，敎學方法方面，生活方面，是否都已臻乎合理的水平以上？這就成為一個很大的疑問了。</p>
<p>新課程標準，由敎部聘請敎育專家訂立，飭令施行，政府雖具竭力趨向合理的决心，然所訂標準或未能盡合實際的需要而絕無浪費，分量也或未能正合學生能力所能負荷，而無過多或不及之弊；至於敎材方面，雖有課程標準可援，然敎科書籍多來自私家坊間印行，一人或三數人之主觀或不免存乎其間，分量，內容，以及時間配合，往往各成一家言；若論敎學方法，因其直接影饗於學生學習的興趣，其敎學效率的等差，百一之比，恐尚未必止於此數。而學生平時日常生活與學習的關係，更未可熟視無睹：有學習的優良環境，始易收學習的效果，有紀律愉快的生活，學習才能有規則的進行。從這幾方面，中學生確都是作着被動的試騐品的：他們不能自知，不實用的課程應當如何拋棄，他們不能自擇，不經濟的敎材應當如何裁汰，他們更不知道，沒有好的敎學方法的敎師當如何另加選擇。最痛心的是文化中心的上海，中學櫛比，而設備完全足為學生學習的優良環境者可斷言絕無而僅有，學生均染於浮薄不切實的風氣，囂張，浪漫，坐堂旣有所不盡可能，更無論繁重工作之應付！雖然這也僅僅是現下敎育之一隅，但惟其有比一隅，東衡哲女士的乎籲，以乎應該不單因為解除繁重工乍而「救救中學生一，而應為沉淪於不合理的苦每中的中學生門放出救命的呼聲！</p>
<p>今日的中學生爲未來民族的命脈，亦爲未來國家建設的進幹才，自然，我們需要未來民族的命脈或未來國家建設的幹才都是強健精壯而軀體足耐艱苦的，然我們同時更需要未來民族的命脈或國家建設的幹才都是智慧多能的，一且其智慧足能應付來日的大難的。所以我還以為多數中學生所受的敎育還不够程度，還不够嚴格！</p>
<p>沒有那一個國家的中等敎育曾像我們的那樣散漫低落的，更沒有一個國家的中學生的生活曾像我們的那樣放浪不覊的。我們不一定要模仿人家嚴格的軍國民敎育，但至少在今日國亡無日的時代中，需要每一個人都能担負起救亡圖存的重担，需要施行嚴肅的救亡敎育！</p>
<p>救救中學生！我也像陳衡哲女士一樣為全國數十萬沉淪於苦海中的中學生們呼籲着。</p>

<h3 id="c237">南北極 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 益昆</p>
<p>假使你去向鄉下老說；世界上有兩個地方，是半年為畫半年為夜的，那你一定要遭到極大的嘲笑。但是，實際上世界的確有這樣兩個地方存在，那就是南北兩極；因為地球與太陽的關係，南極是上半年為夜，下半年為畫，北極則是上半年為畫，下半年為夜。同時，、南極地方的一大部分是一塊陸地；稱做世界最小的「第六大陸」，其周圍皆為海洋，北極的一大部分則為最小的海洋——北極洋所佔着，其周圍是陸地：這便是南北兩極的主要不同之點。可是，這兩極地方亦有許多點是類似的。為一般人所知道者，首先是南北兩極的氣候都很寒冷。在冬季的時候，這兩極地方常常總是在冰點下幾十度的，一切液體，就是酒精，已結成了堅硬的冰塊；冰點以上的溫度，在這里一年之中僅有極短的時候可以享受。然而，信不信由你，世界上最寒的地方，還不算南北兩極，而是西伯利亞的東南部，那兒的氣候是在華氏零下九十多度的，說來眞是可怕！</p>
<p>在巳經溫飽了的待人看來，南北南極雖很寒冷，但其景象却是非常美麗的。這兒有雪白的冰山，有晶亮的冰柱，有灰白的原野，映在我們眼目中的，可說是一個白銀世界。在南極的臨海地方，當着太陽被掩蒙在南方的薄薄的雲兒之下，世間如夢一般的寂靜時，便可以看到在北面的灰黑的海面上浮現出的冰山和冰堤：有的是帶着寒冷的紫白色的，有的因為受着太陽的光照，好像黃金的亦壁。在狂風大作的事候，空中和水面都發出很大的聲音，好像有成羣的豹在不斷狂叫，使人感到極度的緊張，感到大自然的偉大？　畫出　　北極時，當然也可以看見太陽，但這　所見的太陽是在地平綫處　　　　南極的情況是相反的。因此，這兩極地方所呈現出的景色也就有些不同了。不過，兩極的自然美之富有詩意。乃是一樣的。如果你有閒，到南北極去觀賞，那你便會感到許多詩人所歌詠的雪呀，雪呀，海濤呀……的自然美景是不足道的。</p>
<p>在極地上生活的，大多是愛斯基摩人及少數的三毛亞人，他們都住居在冰屋中，以漁獵為生，實在還是一種野蠻民族。近世雖然也有一些歐美人來此探險捕魚，但不能莫是極地的主要居民。至於將來這兩極地方的人類的生活如何，則是要由人類繼續與自然鬥爭的努力來判斷的。</p>
<p>南極探險是過去五十年來人類的壯舉，但北極探險的歷史却是相當古的。遠大紀元前三四五年之際，就有海西利亞的航海者皮達士航行到「北之海」，傳說着這里的長夜的情形及泳世界的狀况。其後在歷史上還有一些探險北極的事情，不過，北極價值的眞正發現，乃是在哥倫布發現新大陸之後。因為資本主義的發展，在航海上需要發見由歐洲到亞洲東部的北方海路，所以才發現了北極地方。開始是在十六世紀發見北極通路，其後遂逐漸有捕鯨船來往，於是北極圈內諸地便漸决被人們知悉了。十九世紀時，羅斯於北美北部發見北磁極，弗蘭克林由北美北部至亞洲東部發見西北通路，蘭仙又橫斷北極海而達北緯八十六度十三分三十六秒之地點，意人卡克尼也達北緯八十六度二十四分之地，所有這些發見不僅使人類更加知道了北極地帶，而且對於科學的發展亦有很大的帮助。及至二十世紀時，北極地帶更引起了人類的興趣，探險者更為進步，因面北極的許多地方更為人所知悉了。最近以來，蘇聯曾用很大的力量不斷地探訪北極，是以以其偉大的新力量來征服自然，至於南極的探險，則是盛行於十九世紀的，英美和瑞典人都有重要的發見。一九二九年美國曾組織探險隊，在培爾德領導之下，自羅斯海至鯨灣上陸以達南極，在這里建立小亞美利加殖民地；並在羅斯冰隊上，創建南極新屋，無綫電台和飛機塲。今後，在人類不斷努力下，南北南極的價值定然是要更大的。</p>
<p>南北極不僅在人類交通往來方面有其意義，同時還有豐富的物產。在南極方面，如蘚苔，海豹，海鳥，金剛石和煤的產量都很豐富，而叫做鯨灣的地方，更是名符其實地在近海的地方有許多的鯨魚，同時海鷗海鳥的產量也極豐富，因此，歐洲人乃至日本人架捕鯨船前往捕鯨者很多，其中有許多人是發了大財的。至於北極地方，則出產樹木，苔蘚，野　，野鳥，海豹，鯨魚和煤等物，同樣是為人所注意的。可是，這些只是目前的發見，至其兩千尺的冰下究竟還藏的有些什麼東西，陸地下還埋藏的有好多竇物，現在還無從知道。因此，這兩個「怪地方」，半年為畫半年為夜的地方，長期冰凍的地方，頗為世界各國所注意；在這裏也和別處一樣，列强爭鬥的情形是很猛烈的。</p>
<p>當此列强正努力準備世界殖民地的再分割的戰爭時，有些人則希望大家努力去開發南北極，把各國過剩的人口移到極地去：這辦法雖不能免除戰禍，但人類之努力消減人類相互的爭鬥，而集中全人類的力量去征服自然，卻是人類的偉大的飛躍的進化。現在，全世界的寶藏還多得很，豈止南北兩極的一部分？如果集中全人類的力量去開發，是很可以使大家的生活幸福的。現在所以還不能如此老，乃是由於人類還在相互爭鬥，使大家無法集中力量對付自然。所以我們在談南北極時，希望大家努力轉變人間的爭鬥為全人類對自然的爭鬥。</p>

<h3 id="c238">川省的疋頭雜貨業 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 友松</p>
<p>在四川各城市銷售的「舶來品」的「疋頭雜貨」，可說全由上海枇發的。一個組織較大，資本較多的商號，大都派有一位精明幹練，行為穩重的夥友。代表本號在上海批取貨物。至於小商店因為經濟關係，則請托別人代莊，或向別家大商號轉批。在上海紮壯的代表即商塲上所稱的「莊客」，他們大都常住在交通便利，接近商業區域的商棧里，以便一進貨」，「發貨」（如帶鈎橋的」益記棧」五馬路的「匯記　等都是川商中的一疋頭雜貨帮」底駐紮地）。他們批貨的方式，除了少數的需要同製造廠或公司直接交涉外，其餘全是「據客」（各製造廠或公司的「批銷員」）的兜攪。等到貨物運到商棧，點交清楚後，莊客便找人打成包裹（俗呼打包」），交給郵局或商船運回四川本號發售。在批購和運輸方面均須經過許多手續，同時也要化去很多成本，所以上海的一疋頭雜貨」（別的貨物也是一樣）到了四川，圾少要貴三分之一，有時幾乎要貴到一倍。</p>
<p>不過，雖說「水漲船高」，血各「疋頭雜貨一商號仍沒有獲得若何利息，有許多甚至虧本走上關門大吉」！這是什麼原因？據說，半由於川省軍閥述年戰爭，烽火不熄；大砲機關槍轟炸得城市格外蕭條，苛　雜稅愈促進了農村破產，一般人吳大都失卻購買力，於是貨物的銷路也就梗塞了！同時因為滙費及運費太高，各商號　購貨物化去成本太多，雖然提高市價，也無濟於事：</p>
<p>一，匯費太高：川帮商人在上海購貨的欵項，全由郵局或銀行匯兌，因為川政複雜，命融紊亂，兌到上海的欵項，總要貼賠很多的滙水。在過去幾年中每千元約需三百元，去年軍事吃緊時期，每千元竟漲到六七百元。在這駭人聽聞的昂貴的匯水之下，有許多商號竟因此賠掉本錢，而莊客也趕快停止買貨，於是整個生意便那陷於停止狀態，如此又怎能說得上　利呢？目前川局雖告平穩，財政雖在整理中，而滙水仍需要六七十元。</p>
<p>二，運費太貴：據郵局的章程規定，寄往川省的包裹特弱無　運費，又因為川內各　　　　　不同，而運費也分出兩種待遇。最少　也要收取（</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>兩倍費」，每重四十四磅的　裏須納寄費四元　角；最多的是「三倍費」，同一重量的包裹須納六元三角。其中如汀津，合川，合江，瀘州，南溪，宜賓各縣，布郵局認為交通比較便利，因之每個包裹收取「兩倍費」，而富順，內江，隆昌，廣安等縣則取「三倍費」。本來「兩倍費」在他們商家已感覺取費很重，至於被徵收「三倍費」的各縣的商家，更覺吃苦艱於担負了！因為「疋頭雜貨一的比重較大，要不到多少，便紮成一個够量的包裹，兼之發貨的數量和次數很多，化去的運費也就不少，同時成本便加重了！</p>
<p>其實除了郵局還可交船　運，而且運費較少。如果交郵，「一件貨」（十二包合一件）以「三倍費」計算，需要七十八元。若交船，連水脚及轉提費在內，則祇須九六十元（在未免出口稅以前。所以被徵收三倍費的富，隆，內，廣等地的商人，為了减輕成本，於是分別的將絲毛織物及雜貨交郵，而棉織品則交船。自從本年八月一日實行統稅制後，免除了每件棉織品的出口稅十七元五角，於是每件貨較之交郵實可减費二十七元多。因之這幾縣的「莊客」便把交郵的絲毛織品也　船　運了！不過　船的手續旣很麻煩，又很遷延時日，船到重慶後還要轉　　人山陸路運輸），所以他們還是希望郵局能减少一位費，同合江瀘州等縣一律待遇，以便交郵。</p>
<p>不久以前，四川的一疋頭雜貨帮滬莊」的「莊客」們，曾一度聯合用書面表示要求本埠郵政管理局轉請總局將富，內，隆，廣等縣的「三位費」减為「兩倍費」。所持的理由是：富順，內江，廣安位居水濱，水道交通廠稱便利，　昌，自流井雖是陸地，但有馬路可通汽車，運輸也不若何困難，論理也應同合江合川等縣一律待遇，同時又謂：如果因為這幾縣的包裹不能一直運到目的地，須於中途轉提，便微費較重，然合瀘等縣也須中途轉提，何以徵費較輕？若是因為這幾縣的路途較遠，那麼川西北各縣有遠過千餘果的，為什麼也同樣祗取「三倍費一呢？他們所要求减費的理由似乎還很充分，因之前月十四日本埠郵政管理局已有函復：「本局徵收包裹資費以運費高低為標準，而寄往隆昌等處包裹運費，實較合川等處為鉅，是以徵收一個單純費，……。再查上月份寄往隆昌等處包裹為數無幾，設一旦各該處包裹資費减一收個單　費，未　對於寄往各該處包裏務是否　　足的進展？此付裏　　增加數目約在多少？能否超越白分之　十？應請查　見覆，俾轉呈南京總局核辦，……。」該商　　得這個覆函後，跟即函答郵局所提出的問題，大致是說富內等縣的貨物如果完全寄郵，全年總有萬多個包裏。八月份寄郵的包裹雖較减少，實因郵費太貴，而船運又减少了出口稅，故交船寄運，便宜很多。假如郵局能够减少一個單純費，那交船的絲毛織品及雜貨均可交郵寄運，如此包裹業務當然可有長足的進步。最近郵局又有眞體答書，並謂內，隆昌等縣的包裹已於十月七日减為「一個半單純費」，其餘如富順廣安及自流井等處尚須另行具兩前去以便再行辦理。不過在川帮認為選未達到目的，甚至有幾縣一對也沒有减少，還要繼續要求减少。他們認為郵政局的章程原是依照各地的交通情形而訂立，所以寄往四川的包裹，徵費片面便有高低的分別。不過這項章程祇能適用於昔日「蜀道難，難於上靑天」的四川，目前蜀道已經不「難」了，而且各縣都有新式馬路，長途汽車輪廻可達，交通當然已很便利，郵包的運輸並無若何困難，所以這項章程便該依照目前的四川交通情形而改變了。</p>

<h3 id="c239">食鹽在生活體中的物理作用 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 蘧陽</p>
<p>鹽是人人必食的，它相來，麵，菜蔬，肉類一樣，成為人類王要食品之一。但鹽對於我們的身體究竟有些甚麼作用，一般普通人是不知道的，所以我想在這要作為科學常識來略談一談。</p>
<p>所謂食鹽，它的化　公式是一個鈵原子和一個氯原子化合成的，在化學上叫做氯化鈉。若以電極性來分別這兩個原素，那麼鈵是帶陽電性的，氯則帶陰電性。當它們各各分解而獨立存在時，就成為游子，鈵成為陽游子，氯成為陰游子。食鹽被溶解於水中時，其分散的晶質有收雖仍保持鹽分子的狀態，然而大部分的分子都分有鈉氣小體，成為游子。大家都知道，陰陽電會互相吸引的，電流借這兩種不同極性的游子之接近而傳導，所以這些游子成為良導體。它們自身亦是異常活潑地運動着，一切化學反映並非分子自身的事，乃是由於游子與游子間所惹起的。這就原子的組織狀况中之電子數及其排列分析起來，說化學反映發生於外圍電子的作用，其理論亦相合。旣然游子是促成化學反映的工具，那麼生活體內之化學反應必賴有游子作用於其間，才能使它活潑地發生出來，這是不待言的。如果生活體內沒有了化學反映，那麼一切新陳代謝和熱力生活能力等等便都會停止了。</p>
<p>游子劉於生活體旣然這樣重要，那麼我們現在來考察一下由食鹽分解開的游子在生活體中究竟佔如何的地位，卽可知道食鹽對於人生的重要之一部分了。在水銀化合物等被離解所生之游子Hg，它具有殺菌的偉大作用，自然是非常重要的。但食鹽的離解所生的鈵游子呢？它也是很重要的。因為它對於原形質雖無劇烈的作用，但在組織液中却有多量的鈉游子存在着。此種鈵游子因其活潑感應性極强，故對於神經具有興奮作用，鈉幾乎成了生活體之興奮性的支持的基本條件。我們體內如無食驪成分，則人必至萎靡頹喪至於無生氣。所以俗話說不吃鹽則無氣力，這是有和當理由的。又鈉和鉀游子一樣，因為它有運動活潑的能力，所以能提高一切新陳代謝作用。不但食鹽中的鈉游子對於生活體很重要，就是生活體中之各種陰游子也以氯游子在血液和組織內佔最多數，它亦為一般生活機能所不可缺的。生活體內旣有了陽游子所具之正電氣量，就必有負電氣量游子與之中和，以保持電量之平衡，這對於生活現象也是極關重要的。</p>
<p>食鹽為甚麼對於生活體具有那樣重要的作用呢？這是為一種物理關係所支配着的。生活體並不是完全的液體或固體，而為一種能够成為固體之膠質體。因為生活體的重要生命核心是細胞，細胞這東西，若以其原形質與水接觸則成圓形，依最小表商法則發生表面張力，卽受液體法則所支配。但細胞又是能自己分化的，細胞分裂就是這種作用，所以它又為固體法則所支配，具有固體物的性質。因為如此，所以生命體大部分為膠質體。</p>
<p>生活體旣爲膠質狀態的牲體，那麼牠就非保持適當的水分不可，並且必須和外物行其物質交換，和自己調節其排泄與攝取作用，才能維持其生活。所以細胞組織之細胞的滲透性是非常重要的。然而此滲透性卻仍那種膠質體的特殊物理作用，它亦因外界物質的影響而變化，因此使它成為適宜於生活之需要的恰當變化是必要的。但是，使它能保持此適當的調節作用的物質溶液，就以適度的食鹽溶液爲最適宜。因爲鹽類所發生的滲透壓力甚強，攝養水分的力量因之也很强。細胞若有適當的食鹽保持一定量的水分，則細胞的緊張適度，若水分過少，則其緊張度亦减少，這就是說可以使細胞失掉活潑的生活能力。</p>
<p>在通常的狀態中，細胞內的滲透壓力和組織液內之滲透壓力是相等的，這是由於細胞內之鹽類濃度和外界驪類濃度相等之故。如果這種均衡破壞了，則生活體卽發生了生機上之滯碍而生出危險來。因為如此，所以一方面食驪成為每日不可少的食品，同時也不可過於多吃。有實騐的事實可作證明，如果割一片生肉浸入濃度極厚的鹽溶液中，則筋肉萎縮，其容積亦大减。反之，若將這片肉浸入比肉細胞內鹽溶液濃度低的鹽水中，則肉片會澎漲其容積。又若將蛙肉浸入與蛙血液滲透壓力相等之蔗糖水中，其興奮减退，甚至漸至完全無反應，若再將此肉取出置入生理食鹽水中，它的興奮力便很速地就復原了。此種原因無他，蓋後者由於蔗糖溶液中缺乏鈵游子，生理食鹽水中則有適當鈉游子，故一則不能由電游子活動引起又應，一，則能因電游子話動引起反應，一則呈生活阻碍現象，一則恰能使生活體順適地保持其活動力。在前者的例中，則由於細胞在濃鹽液中，因液體濃度過高，其中游子活動甚烈，反而頻繁地衝犯膜皮給以高度滲透壓力，却不能通過此膜，但是此種半透性的細胞膜却反因此能讓透過性强之水單獨通過。所以若組織液中食鹽濃度大於細胞內之濃度，則細胞內的水分子被食鹽攝引而出而使細胞萎縮。反之，如果組織液比細胞內食鹽液濃度低，則組織液中的水分充分透入細胞內，細胞便長大了。只有生理食鹽水能使細胞得着適宜的培養而維持其興奮力和適當的生理狀態，否則如而球在濃鹽液中則因失去水分而萎縮，而其在過淡的鹽液中則又會因透入過多的水分而澎漲破裂。一個人在過於食多了鹽時口乾，其理由不過由於全身細胞水分被體液中的濃鹽液吸取過甚，至於感覺水分缺乏而巳。又當我們將生肉塗以多量之鹽，能使之不易腐化，這也是由於將細胞中的水分被吸攝出來了，使之乾燥，便不適宜於微生物生存，醃肉之能使肉緊縮，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>但是，人類食鹽究應以多少分量為最適宜呢？就是說適於保護身體之生理食鹽水究竟要以能含名少鹽分為適宜呢？據科學的者察，食鹽溶液能和細胞的滲透壓力相當的，以百分之一的含鹽量的鹽水為最合宜。凡高等溫而較物都以百分之一或百分之〇·九六為適宜，蛙及凉面動物則以百分之〇六至〇·七為宜，過　便有使血球萎縮，不及便有使血球破裂的危險，均以傷生的。</p>
<p>經濟往來</p>
<h3 id="c240">最近北歐諸國的經濟情況 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 介之</p>
<p>一般說來，從去年開始，那威，芬蘭，瑞典，丹麥等北歐諸國的經濟就有好轉的現象，此種現象直到今年還是繼續着的。</p>
<p>首先，由北歐諸國的貿易情形看來，除那威的輸出减心了一些而外，其他各國今年上半期貿易額比之去年同期的都有增加。不過去年的貿易增加僅是輸出增加，而今年的輸入增加却比其輸出尤大：這可設是其這兩年來的貿易情形的一個顯著的不同之點。從下表我們即可以知道今年丹麥，瑞典　那威的入超部有驚八的增加，同時芬蘭的貿易也已由出超轉變貨入超了。</p>
<p>一九三四年上半期：</p>
<p>輸入　輸出　輸出入　較</p>
<p>瑞典（進萬克羅勒）　六一〇　五六九　四一（入超）</p>
<p>丹麥（進萬克羅勒）　六二　五七六　三（入超）</p>
<p>那威（進萬克羅勒）　三七一　二八三　八八（入超）</p>
<p>芬蘭（進萬荷蘭馬克）　二、一八七　二、二六八　一八一（出超）</p>
<p>一九三五年上半期：</p>
<p>輸入　輸出　入超</p>
<p>瑞典（進萬克羅勒）　六五八　五七一　八七</p>
<p>丹麥（進萬克羅勒）　六四六　六〇四　四二</p>
<p>那威（進萬克羅勒）　三八二　二七七　一〇五</p>
<p>芬蘭（進萬荷蘭馬克）　二、四〇二　二、三七五　二五</p>
<p>除丹麥之外，這個入超的增加都可說是常態的表現。例如芬蘭的貿易，本年上半期的入超即是常態，而其去年上半期的龐大的出超倒是例外。瑞典的入超在大體大可由其對外投資收入來相抵，那威的入超亦可由其海運收入來塡補的。日有丹麥，就在昨年度內其國際收支也已經很少，支出超過收入；本年內因為作為大宗輸出的農產品頗為不振，其國際收支的改善便更少希望了。</p>
<p>同時，在這輸入增加上，最值得注意的是。礎材料之顯著　增加這件事。這樣的傾向在去年即可見到，及至今年時便表的得更明顯了。由此我們可以想見北歐諸國近年來的國內工業確是有些改善的。</p>
<p>事實上，瑞典的食料品及織物類的輸入價格已比前約减少了一千四百萬克羅勒，而其機械的輸入却由二千六，萬克羅勒激增至五千萬克羅勒了。同時，汽車及船舶的輸入約增加了一千八百萬克羅勒，金屬及金屬加工品的輸入亦增加了一千六百萬克羅勒。芬蘭的機械及器具的輸入約增加了一億一百萬馬克，金屬及金屬加工品的輪入增加了八千七百萬馬克，交通用具的輸入也增加了二千九百萬馬克；而其食料品及織物的輸入也是減少了。那威的情形也是一樣，其船舶和　械的輸入也是激增了的。—由此看來，那威，瑞典，芬蘭國近年以來之特別努力發展國內工業這件事，實是很明顯的。如那威議會承認發行五十萬克羅勒公債，建設國內最初由人造　工塲，又承認發行四十萬克羅勒公債，逮設最初的製銅工塲；如瑞典的小規模的銷製品及雜貨製品的工塲之大批地山現，就在本年第二期其新設的股份公司也已有二百八十八家之多，共有資本二千三百萬克羅勒，本年七月末又與瑞士的紡織工塲提携，開始建立了可容織機百二十架的生絲製絲工廠；如芬蘭之豫定分別建設年產一萬噸和一萬五千噸的人造絲工塲；所有這些都是這三國之努力發展其國內工業的具體表現。</p>
<p>由於國內工業的發展，北歐四國工業生產指數當然也有增加的趨勢。如以一九三〇年為基準，則本年六月末北歐四國的生產指數即為百分之一二〇，比之去年六月末的白分之一一四，也增加了六分。其中以織維工業，金屬工業的生產增加最為顯著。下表就是除丹麥之外北歐三國的生產指數情形！</p>
<p>瑞典（一九二九年　一〇〇）</p>
<p>本年五月未　昨年同期</p>
<p>總指數　一〇九　一〇一</p>
<p>輸出工業　八七　八〇</p>
<p>國內工業　一二一　一一二</p>
<p>那威（一九三三年上半期日　〇〇）</p>
<p>本年五月末昨年同期</p>
<p>總指數　一一一　一〇五</p>
<p>輸出工業　一〇九　九六</p>
<p>國內工業　一一三　一一〇</p>
<p>芬蘭（一九二六年日一〇〇）</p>
<p>本年三月未昨年同期</p>
<p>輸出工業　一四一　一三三</p>
<p>國內工業　一三八　一二二</p>
<p>由此表看來，北歐諸國的工業生產確有好轉的現象。但此種好轉之主要原因，却是由於人為地實行生產合理化，加緊剝削勞動者；並非由於自然的經濟的發展。事實上，北歐諸國的生產指數雖在上　，但一般勞動者的生活並未改善，失業人數並未與其生產增加成比例的減少。如瑞典的失　人數，從去年五月末到今年五月末之間，只是由加人失業保險者總數的一四％减少為一〇·五％；芬蘭在同期內的失業人</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<h2>Page 27</h2>
<p>數也只是由二萬四千人减少為一萬三千人；丹麥失業人數之對於失業救濟登記者總數的比較，則是從去年七月的一四％减少為今年七月的一二·，七％；那威自去年七月以來，在一年內的失業人數更是只减少了〇·七％。</p>
<p>至於北歐諸國的金融界的情勢，則楚沒有什麼大的變化。自然，資金需要的旺盛這現象也在金融機關的資產上反映着，如投資的增加即是此種表現。但大部分的資金都是由輸出利益直接得來，而銀行投資的增加卻是很少。同時，在另一方面，存欵的增加也很少，這是因為其國民的所得專用在直接消費中去了，因為在北歐諸國中的信用組合和小規校的金融機關之利用。</p>
<p>不過，最值得注意的，是丹麥對外資本計算的惡化。除丹麥而外，北歐三國的外貨保存都有增加，而在通貨方面也沒有特別的不安。然而，丹麥國立銀行的對外債務，却是從去年末的八千百萬克羅勒　增為本年七月末的一億千萬羅克勒了。這個顯明的對外債務的增加，主要的是由於農產物輸出的不振，其减少額在本年上半期竟達二千萬克羅勒之鉅。</p>
<p>以上便是北歐諸國最近經濟情形之大槪。一般說來，我們雖可說最近北歐諸國的經濟情况巳呈好轉的現象，但此種現象能否繼續理去却還是一個問題。而且，北歐四國並非主要的資本主義國家，因之其人為的一時的部分的經濟好轉，在這整個資本主義世界正在繼續鬧着經濟恐慌之際，說來也是沒有多大意義的。</p>

<h3 id="c241">木彫名匠森川杜園 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 逸書</p>
<p>木彫與木刻不同：木彫可說是封建時代的藝術，木刻可說是現代的藝術；木彫是立體的，木刻是平面的且是結合着彫刻與繪畫的，所以一般皆稱木刻為木刻畫。</p>
<p>本來中國的木彫是很著名的，外人也常談及，但在一般塲合，我們却很少見到關於談論中國木彫的東西：這不能不說是一伴恨事。</p>
<p>日本也有一些著名的木彫家，這裏所要介紹的就是被稱為木彫名匠的森川杜園。自然，要把森川杜園的作品與我國古代著名的木彫相較，那他的藝術技能不見得就能引起我們怎樣的驚異，但在研究日本木彫時，他却是值得特別注意的。</p>
<p>日本有一個名叫喜右衛門的榖米商，他有一個兒子小名友吉。友吉在少年時代就很好學，並且就很愛好繪畫和彫刻，只要有空，他就很有興趣地去做他的刻畫工作。這個少年，便是後來的著名木彫天才森川社園。</p>
<p>一說到森川杜國，在日本差不多述小學生都知道；其在彫刻方面的大名，可以說與我們的鍾　王羲之的精於書法的聲譽一樣。他有十三歲時，卽正式從師學畫。當其十八歲在奈良時，適柴田是眞遊歷到了奈良。於是他就去求其指導，但柴田是眞却向他說：「奈良有很多古代的美術彫刻，你的性格是適宜於彫刻的研究的。」從此他才更專心於彫刻的研究。</p>
<p>以前奈良有一個著名彫刻師叫做松濤，恰好這時杜園可以看到這位名畫師許多作品，使他能專心去研究彫刻，從事於奈良的人形製作。因此，他中年時期的作品頗與松濤的刀法相類似。但杜園的作品是含有寫實味的，是富有生命的，這可說是他的一個特點。</p>
<p>及至老年期，杜園的技能當然更成熟了。在明治時代，他的模寫古代的作品，就被日本人稱為舉世無能與其並比者。</p>
<p>杜園的作品，其特別著名者有：內國勸業博覽會的出品；明治十年　蘭陵王　鹿</p>
<p>明治十四年　點燈鬼</p>
<p>明治二十三年　笑假面　假面</p>
<p>美國支加哥萬國博覽會出品：</p>
<p>明治二五年　牝牡大鹿</p>
<p>其他：</p>
<p>明治十年　武內宿彌木像</p>
<p>明治十六年　與福寺天燈鬼　法降寺</p>
<p>土偶　極樂寺聖德太子二歲像　金峯</p>
<p>山寺鍍金經箱</p>
<p>明治十八年　美濃樵夫　小子部螺贏</p>
<p>膳夫臣巴提使木像</p>
<p>明治二十八年　法隆寺九面觀音</p>
<p>杜圍模寫古物極為細緻，眞實，簡直使人無法辨認其所模寫的原物與其作品。如他所模造的法隆寺的五重塔的士偶，奈良就有一些好事者將其作品與所模造原物放在一起來鑑別，但能識別者竟沒有一人。</p>
<p>據說杜園為人很敦厚溫和，不與人爭，因此人們都很喜歡他。在家庭中，他與他的弟妹們也很和好，因他很迷信，所以常常伴着他的弟妹們去參拜神靈，平時也是與其家人同食同玩，其憂樂的。在日木社會中，見到兄弟很和好者，一般都稱之為「森川風」，其為人之影響於此可見。他的妻是出自官宦之家，善和歌，和他感情很融洽，在各方面對他都有很大的幫助；在他的成功上，他的妻子的助力實在是很不小的。</p>
<p>杜園的身體自來就很康健，很少生病。不過，他和自來的許多藝術才子一樣，有一個不大好的嗜好：愛飲酒。無論早晚，他都不能離開酒杯，每逢他外出到夜半歸來時，多半是大醉而特醉的。酒與彫刻可說是他賴以生活的兩大要素，不能缺少，他就是在進餐的時候，也要把他正在彫刻的作品和酒放在面前，且飲且觀，一到高興時，他就馬上彫下一刀，於是，他便比什麼都快樂了。</p>
<p>明治二十七年七月十五日是這位天才彫刻家與世永別的日子，這時他是七十五歲。他平生所作的作品存留在奈良和東京很多。在奈良者多是偽作，在東京的也很少是其眞正的作品；東京大地震後，更受了很大的影饗，他的作品更不易見到眞的了。現在，他的作品在日本也不易得見，說來是很寶貴的。</p>

<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>檀香山的華僑在社會上經濟上之地位尚稱不惡。其中以廣東人為最多，他們多半是經商，作工，所有作律師和在銀行中服務者，但其數很少。一般說來，這里的華僑的生活還不錯，只是在各種的隈制下，此間華僑今後要想發展，恐怕很困難了。</p>
<p>除此之外，在大洋洲者，如薩摩鳥，菱古羣島，亦各有華工約千人左右，大多是契約勞動者。</p>
<p>八，今後的華僑</p>
<p>由上述的世界各地華僑的情形看來，我們可以說，全世界的華僑，無論是在南洋或在歐美的，都表現出了由興旺到衰落的趨勢；假使像目前這種的情形繼續發展下去，那華僑的前途實在是很悲觀的。</p>
<p>近年來，各地華僑之所以到處受排斥，日益表現出衰落的情况者，其原因不外這幾點；一，華僑勢力的發展引起當地人士之嫉恨；二，世界經濟恐慌的發展使各地工商業不景氣，失業人數增加，於是在工商業的競爭中，在　業的爭奪中，華僑便遭受了大大的排斥和限制；二，我們的國力不如人，各地華僑之備受壓迫和虐待，我們也不能以有效的辦法對付，因之世界各地的當局對於華僑便可以隨意排斥，限制，壓迫了。（未完）</p>

<p>「胡萍在一人之初」中的演技「確是進步得多了。」——這是一般人的公論，並非我在瞎捧</p>
<p>事實，胡萍的演技，確是一天進步着一天，一部戲進步着一部戲的。這固然是由於經騐的增加，但主要的還是由於她的肯用功努力。所以說：「天下無難事，祇怕有心人」，胡萍該是最適切的一個例子了。</p>
<p>現時，她的新作「時勢英雄」又快要和覜衆見面了。她是飾劇中的一個一美人」，一個浪漫的交際化。因個性的適合，再加上平日的肯用功研究，故顯然有着非常愉快的收獲。不過在這裏得特別提出的，即是她的國語的純熟和發音的準確，每一個字都咬得很淸楚，並且聲浪的高低也分得極詳細。因此，她在「時勢英雄」中，不僅演技有更一層的進步，就是對白也都有極美滿的成功。所以可以說：「胡萍確是一僩難得的優秀聲片演員。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Dawn of Peace: France Agrees to Aid Britain's Navy; Britain and Italy to Issue Statement Soon; British Mediterranean Fleet May Be Reduced; Italy Said to Have Proposed Armistice Terms <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) As a result of improved talks between the British, French, and Italian representatives in Rome, the prospects for peace have suddenly brightened today. It is further announced that Britain and Italy will soon issue an important joint statement, further increasing the optimistic atmosphere. Diplomats today believe that this may gradually lead to a path of reconciliation in the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was formally announced here today that French Premier Laval has definitively replied to Britain, stating that if Italian forces attack the British Navy in the Mediterranean, France is determined to cooperate with Britain. According to a report from the British Ambassador, Laval has fully satisfied Britain's inquiry regarding whether France will assist Britain in the future. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) As a result of repeated diplomatic negotiations, Britain has agreed today to withdraw a portion of its fleet from the Mediterranean. Mussolini has also agreed to reduce the troops concentrated in Libya. France has agreed to send warships to fill the defensive duties vacated by the withdrawing British ships in the Mediterranean. This agreement was reached today by the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, in separate meetings with Mussolini and the French Ambassador to Italy, de Chambrun. It is stipulated that the French Navy will sail to the Mediterranean, protecting British interests when necessary. According to Italian sources today, there is hope for a peaceful resolution of the current tense situation. A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry states that the continued talks between the British, French, and Italian representatives indicate that the doors to reconciliation have not been closed in the dispute threatening Europe. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Discussions are currently underway in Rome and Paris, and opinions are being exchanged between London and Paris, raising hopes that a peace movement is being launched again. The British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, met with Italian Premier Mussolini this morning, and the French Ambassador to Italy met with Mussolini on Tuesday. French Premier Laval received the Italian Ambassador in Paris today. According to reliable sources here, talks are being conducted through diplomatic channels between Paris and Rome, and between Paris and London. The exact details are not yet known, but the fact that talks are continuing proves that the doors have not been closed. (October 18, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The outline of France's reply was conveyed this morning by Premier Laval to the British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk. The full text will be formally delivered to the British government tonight.</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, rumors of disagreements between Britain and France are due to inaccurate interpretations by the newspapers of both countries regarding the views of their respective governments. As far as France is concerned, France is prepared to fulfill the mutual assistance obligations under Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant. France is willing to assume its share of collective responsibility and will not shirk it. However, given the current situation, France believes that it is not yet necessary to implement the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. This is France's intention, and there is no other. It is hoped that British cabinet members will make a clear statement so that the tense situation created by the newspapers' advocacy can be eased.</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti met with Laval this morning and presented Italy's conditions for stopping the war against Abyssinia and the basis for resolving the dispute. However, officials are unwilling to disclose the details of the conversation, stating only that Cerruti's remarks were of a reporting nature. (October 18, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Britain recently inquired of France whether France would be willing to assist Britain if the British fleet in the Mediterranean were attacked by Italy. France has replied in the affirmative, and the reply was delivered last night to Sir Clerk, the British Ambassador in Paris. According to responsible sources in Paris, the reply has dispelled misunderstandings between Britain and France. France is prepared to fulfill its obligation under Article 16, Section 3 of the League of Nations Covenant to provide mutual assistance in the event of danger arising from the imposition of sanctions. London was very pleased with this reply. Political circles believe that France has given a satisfactory answer to what Britain considers a necessary point of cooperation between Britain and France in Geneva. It is reported that Britain is now willing to consider withdrawing some of the excess tonnage concentrated in the Mediterranean, but two conditions must be met before the British fleet in the Mediterranean is reduced to its normal strength: (1) Italy must withdraw the troops it has increased in Libya; (2) There must be a perceptible improvement in the overall situation. This refers to the cessation of Italian newspapers' attacks on Britain. Although this condition may be fulfilled in the future, there is currently no understanding between the British and Italian governments. (October 19, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles in London today confirmed that the British fleet in the Mediterranean will not be reduced to its normal strength at this time. Britain will only take this step after Italy reduces its troops stationed in Libya and Italian newspapers stop attacking Britain. However, Britain and Italy are currently engaged in talks in Rome, and if results are achieved, a joint communiqué will be issued. Then, these two conditions may be fulfilled by Italy. France has stated that it is willing to assist Britain if Italy attacks the British fleet in the Mediterranean. Britain may announce the withdrawal of two battleships from Gibraltar in return. The document from France to Britain on this matter will not be published. The main idea is to explain that France's diplomatic policy in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is very open and aboveboard. (October 19, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) Premier Mussolini had an important conversation with British Ambassador Drummond yesterday. The results will be announced before noon on Sunday. The purpose of this conversation is to clear the air between Britain and Italy. It is now believed that although the tension between Britain and Italy may not be completely dispelled, there is no risk of either side acting rashly. Since the concentration of British warships in the Mediterranean, it has been generally believed that this is a sign of Britain taking military sanctions, or at least wanting to blockade Italian ports. (October 18, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) According to official sources, the British government is planning to recall the warships HMS Holt and HMS Renown from the Strait of Gibraltar in the near future. Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, news has been received here from Rome stating that the negotiations between Italian Premier Mussolini and the Emperor of Abyssinia are progressing well. However, powerful sources here believe that the demands made by the Italian government may not be accepted by Britain, as these demands are excessive. (October 19, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Boycott of Italian Goods by Various Countries Begins October 31st: Decision by the Committee of Eighteen Nations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Eighteen Nations decided today to implement a boycott of all Italian goods starting October 31st. The General Committee of 52 Nations will meet this afternoon and is expected to approve it. The League of Nations' sanctions against Italy are thus moving forward on three fronts: (1) An arms embargo against Italy has been implemented by 16 countries; (2) A severance of financial relations with Italy has been implemented by countries such as Soviet Russia, Latvia, and Finland; (3) A boycott of Italian goods will be implemented at the end of the month. (October 19, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Fourteen countries have now notified the League of Nations that they are willing to lift the ban on arms exports to Abyssinia while simultaneously prohibiting the supply of arms to Italy. The latest reports of compliance come from Sweden, Uruguay, Lithuania, and the Irish Free State. (October 19, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, after the League of Nations passed economic sanctions against Italy, it notified all member states via broadcast from Geneva. The official text is being mailed and has not yet arrived in Nanjing. The government is studying in detail the methods and scope of implementing the sanctions. It is generally observed that China's attitude must both fulfill its obligations as a member state and take into account its own special circumstances. (October 19, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After China received notification of the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy, the methods and scope of their implementation are being studied in detail. On the one hand, it is necessary to fulfill the obligations of a member state, and on the other hand, it is necessary to consider China's special circumstances. (October 19, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Coordinating Committee established by the League of Nations under Article 16 of the Covenant made two recommendations on October 16th. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations notified the governments of member states. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also received its official notification. In addition to translating it and submitting it to the Executive Yuan for review, the full translated text of its telegram is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, on behalf of the Coordinating Committee established under Article 16 of the Covenant, transmits to the governments of member states the original proposal announced at the committee meeting on October 16th. The Coordinating Committee's resolution believes that the measures that the committee has proposed and will continue to propose must be implemented quickly and effectively. While it is understood that each country must implement these measures in accordance with its own laws and in accordance with its government's power to implement treaties, the fact that must be noted is that member states of the League of Nations must abide by the obligations arising from Article 16 of the Covenant and take the necessary steps to fulfill their obligations with the necessary speed.</p>
<p>Recommendation 1: The revised table reviewed by the Small Committee of Experts is attached to replace the attached table to the first recommendation. The items considered are arms and ammunition. Category 1: (1) Rifles and pistols and their barrels; (2) Machine guns, automatic rifles, submachine guns of various calibers and barrel lengths; (3) Guns, short cannons, and cannons of various calibers, as well as their matching pipes and rotating parts; (4) Ammunition used in the military equipment listed in items 1 and 2 above, empty shells and codes used in the military equipment listed in item 3, and the charging of these military equipment; (5) Empty grenades, bombs, torpedoes, mines, and their launching equipment; (6) Tank vehicles, armored transporters, armored trains, and all armored products. Category 2: All kinds of warships, including aircraft carriers and submarines (Note: Aviation terminology is based on the Aviation Terminology Dictionary compiled by the Central Aviation School). Category 3 (combining categories 3 and 5 in the Coordinating Committee's documents): (1) Armored and disassembled aircraft, including those heavier than air and lighter than air, and their propellers or air propellers, high-altitude gun mounts or guns, and fuselage tail assembly landing gear assembly; (2) Aircraft engines.

Category 5: (1) Incendiary bombs and all other projectiles used in chemical or incendiary warfare; (2) Tear gas, methyl arsenic dioxide, ethyl arsenic dichloride, and other toxic agents used for chemical or incendiary warfare; (3) Powders used for combat and explosion. When adopting the above text, the Chairman made the following statement: Regarding the items in Category 5, Item 2, according to the 1925 Convention, their use has already been prohibited and is still prohibited. They are mentioned again because their uses are becoming more widespread, leading to even less restriction on their manufacture. The Committee solemnly declares that these various products must absolutely not be transported to Italy. The original text of the first recommendation is further mentioned as follows: For the convenience of member states in complying with the obligations of Article 16 of the Covenant, the following measures shall be implemented immediately: 1. Member states that have prohibited or restricted the export, transit, or passage of arms and ammunition to Abyssinia shall abolish such measures immediately. 2. The governments of member states of the League of Nations shall immediately prohibit the export, transit, or passage of the arms and ammunition listed in the attached table to Italy or its territories. 3. The governments of member states of the League of Nations shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the arms and ammunition listed in the attached table that are transported to countries other than Italy are not directly or indirectly transported to Italy or its territories. 4. The measures stipulated in Items 2 and 3 shall apply to contracts that are currently being fulfilled, and all governments are requested to inform the Secretary-General of the Committee as soon as possible of how they are implementing all of the above measures for transmission to the Committee.</p>
<p>Recommendation 2: For the convenience of member states of the League of Nations in fulfilling their obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, the following measures must be adopted immediately. Member states of the League of Nations must immediately adopt the necessary measures to prevent the following events from occurring: (1) The granting of loans to the Italian government and the raising of loans in Italy and elsewhere on behalf of the national government; (2) The granting of bank loans and other loans to the Italian government, the continued granting of subsidies to the Italian government, or other continued overdrafts, as well as the lending of loans directly or indirectly to the Italian government in accordance with valid contracts; (3) The granting of all loans to government offices or companies within Italy, and the raising of funds for these loans in Italy or elsewhere; (4) The granting of various bank loans or other loans to any government office or company within Italy, the continued granting of subsidies to any government office or company within Italy, or the allowing of continued overdrafts, as well as the lending of loans directly or indirectly to the government office or society; (5) The issuance of various stocks or the raising of other funds on behalf of any government office or company within Italy, as well as the issuance of such stocks or the raising of funds in Italy or elsewhere; (6) Governments must take all necessary steps to ensure that the matters in the aforementioned items 1 to 5 do not take effect directly or through any person of any nationality. Governments are requested to implement these proposed measures immediately without the need for legislative procedures and to fully implement these measures with all implementing steps by October 31, 1935. Governments that cannot obtain the necessary legislative procedures in this way are requested to notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations of the expected date of implementation for transmission to the Committee. Furthermore, all governments are requested to notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations as soon as possible of the measures they have followed in accordance with the aforementioned provisions for transmission to the Committee. At the end of the second recommendation, it is expressed that it is hoped that all governments will notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations as soon as possible of the measures they have followed in accordance with this recommendation for transmission to the Committee. For the convenience of the Committee, it is best for each government to submit the original text of the laws, orders, proclamations, or other official documents that include or implement the above measures, and to translate the gist into English or French and send it to the Coordinating Committee along with the original text. The following text is also adopted: For the benefit of member states of the League of Nations in fulfilling their obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, any recommendations for action in accordance with Article 16 are based on the following provisions of the article: Member states of the League of Nations agree to mutually assist in financial and economic measures to resist any special measures implemented by a country that violates the Covenant against any member. The above text is a reiteration of the notification of October 14. When the aforementioned recommendations were adopted, the Chairman announced that these measures do not apply to charitable donations or payments to religious organizations, which are also clearly agreed to be in this category.

<h3 id="e4">Chaotic Eastern African War News: Italian Forces Consolidate Newly Occupied Positions; Abyssinian Forces Said to Be Counter-Attacking <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian forces on the northern front are currently consolidating their positions and are using thousands of personnel to build roads behind the front lines and construct five large reservoirs. Once the project is completed, they will attack Magal. There were no serious battles on the southern front today. However, several Italian aircraft reconnoitered the area 20 miles southeast of Jijiga, southeast of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway. This is the closest point to the key city of Harar that Italian aircraft have approached. (October 19, Reuters)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa According to a communiqué, Italian aircraft bombed the town of Magal, 65 miles southeast of Adowa, today and strafed the area with machine guns, killing and wounding 60 Abyssinian soldiers. At the same time, thousands of Italian workers, protected by aircraft, are working day and night to expand roads and water sources in order to attack Magal. This is the second largest objective of the Italian forces on the northern front. According to reliable sources, Italian forces are currently advancing along the Surra River, and their vanguard has reached a location near Adamiso, 20 miles from Magal, without encountering Abyssinian resistance. However, they have suffered casualties from Abyssinian sniper fire. It is not yet known whether the Abyssinian forces intend to defend Magal. However, the town is located on a mountain, and the hillside slopes northward, so it may not be as easy for the Italian forces to capture as Adowa. If the Italian forces capture Magal, it will take a long time to build defensive works, as the terrain to the southwest and south is very difficult to travel. The malaria-ridden Takazze Desert is a natural barrier to proceeding to Lake Tana, and the mountain range south of Magal is a commercial route where Abyssinian guerrillas can take advantage of the terrain to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. (October 18, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported from here that mysterious and significant military changes have occurred on the southeastern front in Abyssinia. It is reported that Italian forces are rapidly advancing into the plains, intending to cut the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway. However, official reports state that heavy rains have hampered the progress of the Italian forces, which was unexpected. According to reliable sources, the plan of Italian Commander Graziani to attack the railway with a large number of high-speed small tanks has encountered unexpected obstacles. It is also reported that Abyssinian Southeastern Front Commander Nasibu has now concentrated a large army to protect the railway. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Mogadishu, Italian Somaliland Torrential rains have greatly affected military operations on the Somali front. The attack on Gorahai has been hampered. Rainfall is forecast for another week in the Fafan River area. Rainfall is relatively light in the Shibeli River area, allowing Italian forces to continue their slow advance. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Several warriors from the Uollamo tribe of Abyssinia, known for their strength and indomitable spirit, are currently stationed on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, awaiting orders to go to the front. Today, they staged a demonstration outside the Italian legation and fired shots without permission. The police were unable to stop them. A team of Abyssinian royal guards rushed to suppress them and arrested several people before dispersing the demonstrators. The Abyssinian king heard about it and immediately ordered that the ringleaders be flogged 25 times each. (October 18, Reuters)</p>
<p>Harar Abyssinian Southeastern Front Commander General Nasibu stated today that the Italian forces will launch a major offensive after resting in the low-lying areas in the south. This heavy rain is an abnormal phenomenon this year. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Our correspondent Ognah reports that the Abyssinian government issued a communiqué stating, "The propaganda from the enemy side that the troops in Guji Province have rebelled is not only completely unfounded, but the troops in that province are currently commanded by Prince Emir and are heading towards the northern front. The Italian forces will soon have the opportunity to test the morale of our army." The communiqué also stated, "More and more Italian soldiers are deserting. The deserters have reported to the Abyssinian army about the Italian forces' preparations for battle, stating that the Italian forces are digging trenches and deploying barbed wire on the Adowa, Aksum, and Adigrat fronts to prevent Abyssinian counter-attacks." As for the general atmosphere in the capital, there has been no change since the start of the war. However, national emotions are extremely intense. The people are making war preparations and are eagerly awaiting the Abyssinian emperor's order to go to war. The general public believes that the Abyssinian army will soon be victorious.

<h3 id="e5">France's Reply to Britain <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding France providing assistance when the British Navy is attacked by Italy in the Mediterranean, the reply submitted by the French government was delivered to the British government last night. The contents are divided into two parts. The first part is based on legal principles, roughly stating that France and Britain completely agree on the interpretation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant, believing that if a country is attacked by a sanctioned country as a result of implementing the sanctions determined by the League of Nations, all member states of the League of Nations should automatically come to its aid. As far as the current incident is concerned, if a country is attacked by Italy, France and all member states of the League of Nations should come to its aid. However, if this attack by Italy is due to the attacked country acting alone, then Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Covenant should be invoked and recognized as a new act of aggression. The second part is based on political principles, roughly stating that since the British and Italian governments are unwilling to resort to force and have reiterated that they have no intention of resorting to force, the French government believes that Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant does not need to be invoked. Furthermore, the sanctions determined by the League of Nations are economic and financial in nature. Italian Premier Mussolini has already stated that he accepts them, so there should be no disputes. In addition, the French government hopes that Britain can withdraw a portion of its fleet stationed in the Mediterranean so that the dispute can be resolved in a friendly manner and possible incidents can be avoided. (October 19, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Naval Conference Expected to Be Held This Year: All Parties Willing to Participate <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(London) Hopes are now quite good that a naval conference will be held in London this year. Japan notified the British Foreign Office today, stating that while Japan still insists on its views regarding naval limitations, it is prepared to join the conference. All other naval powers that signed the London and Washington Conventions have now expressed their willingness to participate in the conference. (October 19, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the preliminary talks for the naval conference, the British government made some suggestions to the countries concerned. According to our reporter, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Fujii, delivered his government's reply to the British Foreign Office yesterday afternoon, stating that it was willing to participate in the preliminary talks, but still insisted on the country's basic position, namely that the total tonnage of each country's navy should be relatively equal. This seems to say that although Japan can discuss qualitative restrictions, it demands that its right to equal total naval tonnage be recognized in some way. Thus, although Japan is prepared to participate in the preliminary naval talks, it has not yet been decided whether it will participate in the naval conference in the future. (October 19, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito submitted a memorandum to the State Department today, explaining Japan's views on the naval issue, stating that Japan's attitude towards the international situation has not changed, but it has not closed the door to negotiations. This is the same as the memorandum submitted by the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in Britain to the British Foreign Office. (October 18, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg recently delivered a radio broadcast stating that Austria's policy is neither to favor Italy nor to favor Britain, but only for the benefit of Austria. The tension over the Danube River issue is greater than ever at this time. It is hoped that the League of Nations will take action to ensure Austria's survival. (October 18, Havas)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Ten thousand members of the Patriotic League of Lower Austria, each dressed in military uniform, cheered and congratulated State Chancellor Schuschnigg and Vice Chancellor Starhemberg in front of the federal government office tonight. The Catholic Sturmabteilung of the Lower Austrian Home Guard also participated in the demonstration, as well as other informal military units. After the demonstration, there was a lantern parade. However, it is noteworthy that the commander of the Vienna Home Guard did not order members to participate in the demonstration, and only a portion of the members participated voluntarily.

<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The grand Sixth National Games, lasting for eleven days, concludes today. The participating athletes have displayed vibrant spirits, promoting and vigorously striving, creating numerous new records. Today, they bid farewell to their companions and return to their hometowns. Those who return with accolades are, of course, pleased with the fame they have rightfully earned. Even those who did not win medals are content with the contributions they have made. The enthusiastic expectations of the vast audience and the unanimous encouragement from newspapers and magazines will undoubtedly leave a deep and pleasant impression, a lifelong memory. However, when these gentlemen leave the sports field and return to their respective hometowns, is this all they take with them?</p>
<p>These gentlemen come from all over the country, even from the remote regions of northern and western China, undeterred by the hardship of travel, eagerly rushing here. Moreover, overseas Chinese compatriots have come in groups, like travelers longing for their homeland. However, the places from which these gentlemen come rarely present a scene of happiness; instead, they are filled with anxieties and troubles. Perhaps a powerful neighbor is extending its claws, poised to seize them. Or perhaps a devastating disaster rages, leaving the people as starving corpses. Or perhaps fields and gardens are abandoned, with farmers lacking the capital to cultivate them. Or perhaps markets and shops are desolate, with merchants at their wits' end regarding their skills in trading and relocating. When these gentlemen mustered their spirits to prepare for this display of skill, they must have simultaneously remembered these various situations, filled with sorrow and lamentation. How could they forget them? Furthermore, the sports field where these gentlemen leaped and ran is located beside an area that was a battlefield just three years ago. During their leisure time, as these gentlemen wandered among the fields, they must have thought of how this land, now covered with crops, was once soaked with the hot blood of those who died for their country. Moreover, they saw broken tiles and ruined walls, charred beams and shattered pillars, imagining the tragic scene of countless lives and properties turned to dust. The feelings that arose in them must have been more than just sighs and lamentations. As these gentlemen shared their homesickness and mourned the traces of war, they must have increased their understanding of the current state of our nation and strengthened their resolve to dedicate themselves to its future. They must have realized that unless they gather the strength of the masses into a great force and unite the hearts of the masses into a great heart, there is no way to save the nation from ruin or ensure its survival in this world. They must also have recognized that this assembly, gathering comrades from various places in one place, is nothing less than a sign of the great force and great heart being solidified. If so, then these gentlemen's departure today represents a breakthrough in their awareness. This is the best harvest of this trip.</p>
<p>These gentlemen possess strong physiques and exceptional skills, which are, of course, gratifying aspects of life. However, the reason they are gratifying is that they provide the means to undertake arduous tasks and serve the masses. As for fame, it is an external thing. Even if it is said that it is by no means accidental, there is no need to let it consume your mind. There are those who excessively praise the sporting cause, calling out the names of the athletes, praising and singing their praises, as if they were circus performers with huge elephants and fierce lions, exclaiming, "How magnificent! How heroic!" Such praise is incessant, but the elephants and lions remain mere playthings. Is this the fame of athletes, or is it actually their shame? On this point, you gentlemen should be especially discerning and handle it well. We also see some who are fond of sports, forgetting that it is a means rather than an end, having no other concerns beyond leaping and running, no other worries beyond defeating opponents and winning. They enjoy it tirelessly, as if it were their lifelong pursuit. This is to betray their great advantage. Even in prosperous and powerful countries, this is not appropriate. How much less so in our weak and troubled nation? How can you boast about this? You gentlemen have been inspired by observing power, and your consciousness has already made a breakthrough. You will probably not fall into this error, will you? A strong physique must be accompanied by correct knowledge. Heroic strength must be applied to practical paths. This is what we expect from you gentlemen, and it is also what you should strive for yourselves. You gentlemen are returning. The autumn wind is already fierce. Please take care of yourselves.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese Economic Inspection Group is currently inspecting the Kansai region. Japanese financial circles now have the idea of organizing a delegation of influential figures from the business world to visit China as a reciprocal gesture. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also actively mediating, and various business organizations plan to send strong representatives to participate in the delegation. (Jiji News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Koseikai, an organization of influential Japanese industrialists, has decided to hold an Oriental Industrial Conference in China, Korea, and Manchuria to discuss important issues in industrial education, industrial regulations, product testing, and other industrial technology and academic matters, with the aim of promoting the development of industry in the Far East. Japan will be represented by Inoue Kyo Shiro as chairman, with a total of 26 people. They are scheduled to leave Japan for Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd and will hold meetings in the following locations: Shanghai from October 25th to 28th, Nanjing on the 29th, Tianjin from November 1st to 3rd, Beijing from the 3rd to the 4th, and Dalian from the 5th to the 9th.

<p>(Tokyo) Minister Kodama has decided to establish the Nanyo Development Company to actively implement national policies in Southeast Asia. Private economic organizations are also determined to assist the government in establishing a lifeline in Southeast Asia. Preparations have already begun to organize an economic inspection group to investigate the actual situation in Southeast Asia. The specific details are as follows: (1) Select inspection group members from a wide range of financial circles. (2) Depart from Japan on November 15th, with an inspection period of two months. (3) The inspection area includes Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, Java, and Siam. Yasugawa Yunosuke and Ito Bunkichi have already decided to participate. Others will be selected from Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and other companies. (Jiji News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Matsushima, entrusted with an inspection mission, inspected the state of sales of Japanese goods in various Near Eastern countries, including India, Siam, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, and Palestine. He returned to Tokyo on the morning of the 19th. According to his report, these Eastern countries are oppressed under the influence of European and Russian powers but are striving to maintain the true face of independent nations, which is admirable. In particular, Afghanistan, caught between the two powers of the British Empire and Russia, earnestly hopes for Japanese economic assistance. Countries west of India have no natural resources and very little purchasing power. Because Japan has no raw materials to buy, the state of trade cannot be further expanded. Iran has a French language school, and Afghanistan has a German language school, both actively implementing cultural work. If Japan wants to guide Asia, it must first develop in the cultural field.

<h3 id="e18">Mongolian Political Council Holds Meetings for Several Consecutive Days; Opening Speech by Prince De <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Bailingmiao: The Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian Political Council opened on the 9th. More than 200 committee members, princes, and guests arrived. Prince De delivered an opening speech, which briefly stated that the Mongolian Political Council has been formally established for one year. Today is the opening day of the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian Political Council, which is also the second anniversary of the Mongolian autonomy movement. In these two years, some Chinese have sympathized with us, while others have doubted us. Those who sympathize with us believe that our autonomy is in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, realizing equality among all ethnic groups in the country, and seeking the survival of the entire Chinese nation. Those who doubt us believe that our autonomy is to break away from the central government and declare independence. Some even mistakenly believe that we have imperialist backing. Reviewing our two-year history, whether we have obeyed the central government or betrayed the central government is clear and undeniable. In short, Mongolian autonomy, politically speaking, is to promote the efficiency of central administration and save the central government from the suffering of being too far away to be effective. Diplomatically speaking, it is to promote good neighborliness and security. In terms of national defense, it is to consolidate border defense. Financially speaking, it is to develop resources. In the future, we will continue to adhere to our original intention, regardless of praise or blame, regardless of success or failure, knowing only that we must take the interests of the nation and the country as the premise, seek the survival of the entire Chinese nation, and be one with the country. We will never destroy the history of our ancestors and bring shame on future generations. O descendants of Genghis Khan, be alert! O descendants of the Yellow race, know this! We only hope for the central government's understanding and the people's analysis. As for the Western Banner incident, it is not worth mentioning. The League Chief under the guidance of our Mongolian Political Council has the power to appoint and remove illegal princes. This customary law has been in place from the Yuan Dynasty to the Republic of China. With this spirit of fairness, we maintain hereditary succession. The governance of our Mongolian Political Council over the banners is the same as the governance of county governments by local provincial governments. (Omitted) Mencius said, "Without rules, there can be no squares and circles." I cannot help but feel deeply moved. I sincerely hope that the central government will give this its final thought. This is what we deeply pray for. At the beginning of this Third Plenary Session, I especially hope that all committee members will have practical proposals to enrich the spirit of autonomy, so as not to fail the high hopes of the people and the cultivation of the central government. From 10:00 am until 1:00 pm, preparatory meetings were held for several consecutive days. On the 15th, Prince Yun arrived at the meeting despite his illness. Once Wu Heling arrives at the temple, the formal meeting will begin. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Shantou Mayor Hosts Meeting with Various Circles to Explain Smuggling Case <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Gan Jiehou and Wu Bosheng Arrive in Shantou, Li Yuanhe Says Negotiations Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The case of Jieyang County government detaining smuggled foreign rice has caused a Sino-Japanese dispute. Currently, the Japanese attitude is still very tough. Six Japanese warships are still anchored in Shantou Port. Rear Admiral Shimomura, Commander of the 5th Squadron of the Japanese Fleet, is in charge of this case, and has been negotiating with the municipal government authorities on the command ship Ryūjō and at the Japanese Consulate in Shantou for several days. Gan Jiehou and Wu Bosheng, who were sent by the provincial authorities to Shantou to take charge of the negotiations, arrived in Shantou a few days ago, and immediately met with Shantou Mayor Li Yuanhe and Chao-Hai Customs Superintendent Zhang Jinghui, Commander Shimomura, and Japanese Consul Tanaka Ichiro stationed in Shantou to hold several sincere talks. The opinions of both parties have gradually converged. Wu Bosheng first returned to the province a few days ago with the terms of the negotiations agreed upon by both parties to request instructions. Therefore, the key to resolving this case still lies with the province. Li Yuanhe convened representatives from more than a dozen organizations such as Shantou reporters, lawyers, the North and South Port Guilds, and the Medical and Pharmaceutical Guilds at the Municipal Government Auditorium at approximately 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th. Li first reported, saying, "Recently, rumors have been spreading in the city, and citizens have been alarmed by each other. This is all unnecessary panic. After all, the only foreign incident that has occurred in Shantou recently is the Sino-Japanese dispute caused by the Jieyang County government detaining smuggled foreign rice. In this matter, the Japanese side's reason for negotiating with us is that we have violated international trade treaties. However, the smuggled foreign rice detained by the Jieyang County government was seized from stores in our country and has nothing to do with Japan. I have refuted this matter and am negotiating step by step, which is progressing smoothly. It is not as serious as the outside world has reported. This case can be resolved peacefully soon. All circles should feel at ease in their work and not be misled by rumors." At that time, two representatives from the Reporters Association inquired about the points of uncertainty about the case with Li. Li did not immediately answer due to time constraints and because the matter involved foreign negotiations and it was inconvenient to release information before it was resolved. The details of the negotiation are currently kept secret by the authorities and cannot be ascertained, and there are various reports circulating outside. However, the other party's demand for demarcation is indeed a fact, that is, they want to delineate the area below Xinxing Road as a special zone, and build wharves and warehouses at the end of Shenzhao Road, and also set a deadline of fourteen days for a reply. In recent days, Japanese sailors have often landed unarmed in groups and gathered at the Japanese Consulate and nearby Dongying Elementary School on Qilu Shenzhao Road. What they are doing is unknown. However, it is heard that Dongying Elementary School has already suspended classes. On the evening of the 11th, two teams of unarmed Japanese sailors, about thirty or forty people, went to the vicinity of the Chao-Shan Railway Station after landing, and hesitated slightly. The Shantou market is as quiet as usual, and it is expected that no accidents will occur. Fan Zhanpeng, Director of the Provincial Anti-Smuggling Office, arrived in Shantou from Hong Kong by boat on the 11th and went to the Anti-Smuggling Sub-Office to meet with the Sub-Office Director Xiao Sheng to inquire about the current situation of smugglers and anti-smuggling efforts. Then, he and Xiao took the Chao-Shan Railway to Chaoan to visit Division Commander Deng Longguang to discuss everything, and investigate the situation of smuggling in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas. It is heard that Fan plans to stay in Chaozhou and Shantou for a few days to thoroughly understand the inside story of the smugglers, and then return to the province to plan the entire method of preventing smuggling.

<p>Commemorative Conference on November 2nd, Also Holding the National Medical Association Annual Meeting</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangzhou Boji Hospital was established seventy-six years before the Republic of China (1835). Not only did it open a new era in Chinese medicine, but it was also the first hospital in the Far East to adopt Western medical techniques. In 1844, the first lithotomy was performed. In 1847, ether anesthesia was first used. The following year, chloroform was used. In 1875, the first abdominal surgery was performed. The earliest hospitals in the province, such as Haikou and Yangjiang, were all branch hospitals established by Boji. In the country, such as Xiamen, Shanghai, Beiping, Ningbo, and even neighboring Japan, eighty or ninety years ago, Boji doctors had successively transferred to practice medicine. The hospital was originally founded by British and American missionaries. Later, Dr. John Kerr came to serve as the director of the hospital. In 1855, a medical school was attached to the hospital. Initially, it only admitted male students. In 1879, at the request of the Zhenguang Girls' School, it also admitted female students, truly opening the beginning of co-education for men and women in China. At that time, the teaching method was only oral lectures and notes, and then medical books were translated. More than twenty kinds of translations were made successively, including "New Theory of the Body" and "Chemical Abstract", many of which are still worth exploring today. In particular, the treatment of gonorrhea by surgery is the most effective. An English annual report is published every year, briefly announcing the work of the year. Since 1920, it has been taken over by the Board of Directors of Lingnan University, and has become an organization of Chinese people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen began studying medicine at Boji Hospital. This year marks the 50th anniversary of his medical studies, and the centenary of the opening of Boji Hospital. Last year, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Zhong Rongguang, and others specially organized the Sun Yat-sen Medical College Preparatory Committee, and the National Government allocated funds to expand Boji Hospital and rename it Sun Yat-sen Medical College. A commemorative conference is scheduled to be held on November 2 of this year, on the one hand to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the arrival of Western medicine in China, and on the other hand to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's medical studies and revolutionary movement. After the meeting on that day, the opening ceremony of the new college and the groundbreaking ceremony of the medical college will be held at the same time. During that week, it will also be the annual meeting of the Chinese Medical Association, and famous Chinese doctors will gather here at one time. It is truly an unprecedented initiative in the medical community.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Ban on Opium and Narcotics: Special Regulations for Punishment <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Change of Jurisdiction for Opium Cases to Military Law; Directive from the General Headquarters to be Followed Uniformly Nationwide</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since assuming the position of Director-General of Opium Suppression, Chairman Chiang has paid increasing attention to the suppression of opium and narcotics. Considering that the penalties stipulated in the Opium Prohibition Law were relatively light and the judicial process was too lenient, which he believed would prevent the complete eradication of opium as scheduled, he specially formulated the Regulations for Punishing Opium and Narcotics Offenses. These regulations were submitted to the 479th Central Political Conference on the 16th and approved for record. Simultaneously, the Wuchang General Headquarters issued a directive to all provincial and municipal governments nationwide to comply with the regulations uniformly. The original directive stated in brief: "Strictly prohibiting opium and narcotics within a limited time and completely eliminating them is a consistent policy of our country throughout history. However, due to inconsistent authority, the results have not been significant. Furthermore, the spread of banditry and frequent local incidents have made it difficult to effectively eradicate opium and narcotics. Despite repeated orders from the government, the situation remains lax and the harm continues to deepen. This Commissioner is deeply alarmed and has therefore put forward the two-year opium prohibition policy, urging subordinates to implement it diligently. Therefore, in May of last year, the Nanchang General Headquarters first severely punished offenders involved in highly harmful opium substitutes, such as morphine, cocaine, heroin, red and white pills, and other similar narcotics. The Interim Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics were promulgated and circulated to all provinces, adopting the principle of using severe measures in times of disorder to deter others. After a year of implementation, it has shown significant effectiveness, gradually eliminating the harm of narcotics and transforming public morals. As for opium, repeated orders and laws have also been issued to strictly prohibit it. However, because the penalties stipulated in the Opium Prohibition Law are relatively light and the judicial process is too lenient, the people cling to their ingrained habits and lack the determination to cleanse themselves. The crime of smoking opium only results in fines or the lowest degree of imprisonment. The penalties for planting, transporting, selling, and trafficking are also light, which encourages unscrupulous people to exploit loopholes in the law and is incompatible with the method of controlling opium prohibition in stages. This Commissioner has been deeply concerned day and night, believing that it is necessary to change the course of action to facilitate progress and cope with the situation. Now, having received the government's solemn mandate to assume the important responsibility of opium suppression, I must earnestly implement the orders. Based on past experience in opium and narcotics suppression and the current environmental needs, and after consulting various old and new regulations, I have conducted detailed research, summarized, and supplemented them. I have drafted Interim Regulations for Punishing Opium and Narcotics Offenses and have changed the jurisdiction for opium cases to military law. All trials and reviews will be conducted according to military law procedures to increase efficiency and prevent disputes, thereby upholding the central government's intention to pay attention to opium suppression and entrust it to concurrent management. In addition to submitting the regulations to the National Government for promulgation and implementation, and requesting that the Opium Prohibition Law be abolished and the provisions of Chapter 20 of the new Criminal Law regarding opium offenses be suspended, I now order you to comply with the regulations. You must ensure that your subordinates strictly comply with these regulations from the date of their implementation and should widely inform the people in advance so that they are aware of the warnings and do not fall into the trap of criminal punishment. There is great hope in this."</p>
<h3 id="e77">Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: Railway Ministry Recovers the Nanping Section for Self-Management <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>—Sending Ling Hongxun to Prepare for Engineering Matters—</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: The Nanyu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has failed to be completed on schedule due to obstacles such as banditry, floods, diseases, and epidemics. However, the track-laying work has progressed fairly quickly and is expected to be open to traffic in mid-November of this year. For the remaining Nanchang to Pingxiang section, the Railway Bureau originally planned to move the engineering office to Nanchang after the completion of the Yunan section project, transfer personnel from that section to work, and continue to extend westward, estimating that construction would begin next spring and be completed within two years. However, according to reliable information, the Ministry of Railways has decided to recover the section (Nanchang to Pingxiang) for self-management and to organize the Jiangxi-Hunan Railway Engineering Bureau to be responsible for constructing the section. The bureau headquarters will be located in Nanchang. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways has sent Ling Hongxun, director of the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Engineering Bureau, to begin preparations. As for the route of the section, the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have repeatedly sent teams to measure and survey multiple routes. Detailed reports have been prepared regarding the mileage, engineering, and economic conditions along each route. The responsible authorities have conducted comparative studies based on the reports and are awaiting a final decision. It is reported that the originally considered routes included: (1) crossing the Yangtze River at Nanchang, passing through Wanzai and Liuyang to Changsha; (2) crossing the Yangtze River at Nanchang to Zhangshu, heading up the Yuan River to Pingxiang; (3) crossing the Yangtze River at Nanchang to Qingjiang, heading up the Yuan River to Pingxiang. After research, the first route was deemed to have the following drawbacks: (A) The Hengduan Mountains within Liuyang hinder construction; (B) There are large mountains across the Xiang River from Changsha, and the railway has no way out after crossing the Xiang River. Future extensions to Chongqing would have to detour across the Xiang River, and the curves and slopes of the old Zhuping Road from Pingxiang to Liling cannot be improved or connected. The second and third routes were also deemed unsuitable. In the future, one of the following two routes may be selected: (1) crossing the Yangtze River at Nanchang to Wanzai to Liling; (2) crossing the Yangtze River at Zhangshu through Yichun to Liling. Neither of these two routes passes through Pingxiang City.</p>
<p>According to Xie Longwen, deputy director and transportation section chief of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the operating income of the Hangyu section of the railway this year has not been as optimistic as expected due to various influences. For example, Quzhou and its surrounding counties were formerly famous paper-producing areas, and Jindong and its surrounding counties were known for their pig farming. Previously, exports were very strong, but now sales are sluggish and production has sharply decreased. Eastern Zhejiang is a fishing and salt-producing area, and in the past, domestic sales were also broad. Now, public salt collection has stopped, and private salt is rampant. All of these factors have affected freight transport. However, as the reputation of the Railway Bureau increases daily, it has gradually gained general trust. Therefore, the freight transport statistics for the past eight months of this year have still increased by 170,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. However, passenger transport has decreased by 80,000 yuan. According to general observation, passenger and freight transport may be expected to improve after the railway reaches Nanchang. However, eastern Jiangxi was severely affected by banditry in the past, and production has stopped. Although the remnants of the bandits have been suppressed, unburied corpses can still be found everywhere in the valleys and streams, emitting a foul odor. As a result, epidemics are rampant in various places, and many people, young and old, male and female, are suffering in their sickbeds. It will be difficult to revive the rural economy for a while. For these reasons, the business prospects after the opening of the Yunan section are not optimistic in the short term. The opening date of the section must be determined after the completion of the bridges is confirmed. The largest bridges in the section are those at Liangjiadu and Guixi. The Liangjiadu Bridge has one section with fourteen piers and another with five piers, both of which are nearing completion. The Guixi Bridge has twelve piers, but four piers have not been completed due to the rapid river current. The track-laying work has little left to be done, and the tracks can be connected in each section within days. Stone ballast engineering is currently underway. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">What I Saw and Heard on My Journey West <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>—Song Hua</p>
<p>The Journey from Yichang to Chongqing</p>
<p>The section of the Yangtze River from Yichang to Chongqing is called the Sichuan River by the people of Sichuan. The Sichuan River is particularly difficult to navigate. In the past, river steamers traveled from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the upper reaches, with Yichang as the terminus and no further upstream. Water transportation above Yichang relied solely on wooden boats (i.e., sailboats). The river currents are very rapid, and it is very difficult for wooden boats to travel upstream. They could hardly move forward without boatmen pulling them along rugged mountain roads. When encountering cliffs on both sides, where boatmen could not pull the boats from the shore, they had to find a way to moor the boats and wait quietly for favorable winds before being able to raise sails and advance. Therefore, traveling from Yichang to Chongqing often took months. More than thirty years ago, a British person risked sailing a river steamer on the Sichuan River. After its success, the river steamer repeatedly encountered dangers and setbacks before gaining extensive experience in navigating the Sichuan River. Today, river steamers can travel freely on the Sichuan River without obstruction. When drinking water, one should remember the source, and it is truly impossible not to attribute the success to the arduous efforts of the predecessors. However, the gorges of the Sichuan River are strangely dangerous, and there are many dangerous shoals and hidden reefs. Therefore, river steamers on the Sichuan River can only travel during the day and moor at night, and no one dares to navigate at night. It takes four days to reach Chongqing from Yichang and only two days from Chongqing to Yichang because it is downstream.</p>
<p>River steamers traveling on the Sichuan River must have special river pilots on board to guide them. It is said that these river pilots come from the ranks of the "Tai Gong" on wooden boats. The so-called "Tai Gong" is the captain who commands the boatmen on wooden boats. They have special experience in the navigation routes of the Sichuan River and can understand where there are hidden reefs or shoals just by looking at the water patterns and waves in the river. River steamers need these river pilots for this reason. However, to become a river pilot, one must first pass the examination of the Customs and be given a license before assuming this position. Not every "Tai Gong" on a wooden boat can serve as a river pilot. As for why river steamers cannot navigate at night on the Sichuan River, it is because the river pilots cannot distinguish the water patterns and waves in the river at night. After a river steamer arrives in Yichang from the downstream, several river pilots board the ship. After boarding, they take turns guiding the helmsman, changing every three hours, fearing that prolonged viewing would cause blurred vision and endanger the river steamer. The special circumstances of river steamers traveling on the Sichuan River can be seen from this.</p>
<p>I boarded the "Minzheng" steamer on the 29th of last month and headed west from Yichang, first passing through the Xiling and Wushan Gorges. The mountains on both sides are very majestic and mostly cliffs. What is particularly strange is that when looking ahead from the bow of the ship, one only sees overlapping high mountains, rugged and towering, and *** fill the eyes. Therefore, traveling between mountain gorges can sometimes give people a feeling of "returning to the starting point." On this day, the scenery was all special mountain scenery and water colors. We also passed the magnificent Wushan Twelve Peaks, which broadened our horizons. The boat anchored in Wushan County at night.</p>
<p>The next day, we first passed the Qutang Gorge, Gate, Baidi City, and the Eight Trigrams Formation. Baidi City is where Liu Bei, the emperor of Shu Han, entrusted his son. The Eight Trigrams Formation is said to have been set up by Zhuge Liang. According to the ship's staff, there is a dry Eight Trigrams Formation on the shore and a water Eight Trigrams Formation in the river. What we saw on the boat was only the latter. In the afternoon, we passed Yunyang, and across from it was the "Lord Zhang Temple," which worships Zhang Fei. The temple is very magnificent, and on the wall facing the river are the four large characters "Jiang Shang Qing Feng" (Clear Breeze on the River), written by the famous calligrapher Peng Yunbo. The brushstrokes are strong and vigorous. When viewed from the boat, the calligraphy is very clear. It is said that there is also Zhang Fei's head in the temple, stored in an oil jar. If oil is poured in, the head will float out. Whether this is believable is still uncertain. The boat rested in Wanxian at night.</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month, we passed Zhongzhou and Yinshan (also known as Shibaozhai). There are pagodas and temples on the mountain, said to be the hometown of Qin Liangyu, a famous female general of the late Ming Dynasty. On this day, I talked with Commissioner Liu of the Postal Service, who was on the same boat, about the situation in Sichuan. He said that he had gone to the counties of Youyang, Pengshui, Xiushan, and Qianjiang in southern Sichuan last year on official business. There were many bandits in the area, and he narrowly escaped disaster. Later, he asked the Public Security Bureau to send armed police to escort him before he dared to complete his official duties in various places. There is a Sichuan saying, "There is no need to teach a son, just let him travel to You, Xiu, Qian, and Peng once." This is because traveling to these four counties can provide many special experiences. These four counties and their vicinity have mineral resources and many wasteland areas. If they are developed to benefit the people, it would be a way to eliminate banditry. We passed Fengdu City at sunset. There are temples such as the Heavenly Son Hall and the Qin King Hall in the city. There are also two white pagodas along the river, facing each other diagonally, which can be seen from the boat. It is said that the two pagodas have yin and yang divisions, which is a superstitious belief. Commissioner Liu said that foolish men and women often go to the temples to buy talismans and "road guides" (passports for the underworld). The temple thus earns a special income. According to the book "Yichang to Chongqing" compiled by the Bank of China, there are two reasons why people mistakenly believe that Fengdu has the underworld: (1) Wang Fangping of the Former Han Dynasty and Yin Changsheng of the Later Han Dynasty once practiced Taoism on Pingdu Mountain in the county, so some people called it Yinwang Mountain. Later, it was falsely spread that this mountain had the King of the Underworld. (2) The county has the Xiantu Temple and the Wuyao Cave, which Taoists call the "Zifu Zhenxian." Therefore, some people mistakenly believe that Fengdu is not a place for ordinary people. Therefore, some people associate Fengdu with a fairyland or the underworld. In fact, Fengdu is clearly a human world, with no underworld or fairyland. Our country has too many illiterate people, and superstition has not been broken, which is regrettable. After the boat passed Fengdu, it sailed to the small town of Tongyuan Temple for the night.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the boat passed through the Scissors Gorge, Fuling, and Changshou. Although there are still high mountains on both sides, they are not as magnificent as those seen on the first and second days after leaving Yichang. It rained on this day, and we saw large and small waterfalls on the mountains on both sides, like dancing white ribbons. The moment on the mountainside was like smoke, like mist, and like catkins, which was a wonderful sight. There were many sailboats in the river. Some of the boats had flags inserted, which were said to be镖 flags, indicating that the boat was insured by so-and-so and that the passengers and cargo were safer. Many boatmen on these sailboats traveling up the Yangtze River often pulled the boats naked on the shore. When encountering cliffs, they immediately jumped into the water to board the boat, which was very difficult and pitiful. Mr. Chen, an employee of the Bank of China on the same boat, had traveled to various places in Sichuan and told me that he had seen large sailboats on the Jialing River, each with dozens of boatmen pulling them. When the boatmen pulled the boats, they were completely naked in warm weather, not wearing a single thread. In cool weather, they only wore short clothes and no trousers. However, their steps were neat, and they sang mountain songs in unison, like boatmen's songs, just like a very disciplined army. Their singing was quite loud, and the tone was tragic. He also said that the poor people in Sichuan were very bitter, and the lives of miners and boatmen were particularly bitter. Green forest heroes who committed crimes and repented often joined the work of miners and boatmen, because it was not easy to be arrested either by mining underground or by traveling to various places with ships. Mr. Mo Dehui was also on the same boat to Chongqing. In the afternoon, I chatted with Mr. Mo. We first talked about the North China issue and diplomatic issues, and then we talked about the national economic issue. Mr. Mo expressed deep sorrow at seeing foreign ships freely entering and leaving the Yangtze River, saying that if China could not increase tariffs, it would be difficult to stop the leak of wealth, and the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth were by no means accidental. During the chat, the boat traveled very slowly, even slower than a sailboat. Someone came to report, "The ship's engine is damaged, and it may be difficult to reach Chongqing today." Mr. Mo sighed and said, "We are all in a leaky boat." The meaning of his words was ambiguous, and everyone who heard it was moved. Fortunately, the ship's engine was soon repaired and was able to continue sailing as usual. It reached its destination at six o'clock in the afternoon (Chongqing is a full hour behind Shanghai; at that time, Shanghai was only five o'clock). It was already dusk. By the time we hired a small boat, crossed the river, and landed, thousands of lights were already lit.</p>

<p>Yesterday, one ocean-going ship and one river steamer were in distress and reported to their respective head offices in Shanghai. Rescue efforts are currently underway. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Beihua: The Beilun ship of the Northern Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 1,378.89 tons and a length of 206 English feet, has compartments that can hold 17,000 bags of grain. It usually operates on the Northern Seas route. This time, it was going to Zhenjiang to transport grain to Tianjin and was originally scheduled to go directly to North China without coming to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, shortly after the ship left Zhenjiang, its engine rudder suddenly broke down, and the Beihua lost its ability to move. The shipowner felt that it was very dangerous due to the heavy load and the broken engine rudder. Yesterday, he sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai for help. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai company immediately sent a tugboat to Zhenjiang to tow the Beihua back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Huaxing: The Huaxing ship of the Huaxin Shipping Company is currently loading salt in Haizhou. Yesterday, news was received in Shanghai that the ship was stranded in Haizhou due to the tide receding. The shipowners and others repeatedly tried to find ways to drive it out of the shallows but were unsuccessful. They are now waiting for the tide to rise to try to leave the shallows.</p>
<p>Dalu: The Dalu ship of the Dalu Industrial Company, fully loaded with coal, was coming to Shanghai from Jiujiang and was stranded in Tongzhou. Upon receiving the news in Shanghai, a tugboat has been sent to tow and rescue it.</p>

<p>The Cooperation Department May Be Officially Established Next Month: New Progress in the Rural Work Discussion Conference</p>
<p>Zhang Yuanshan, Director of the Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Industry, traveled from Ping to Wuxi to participate in the National Rural Work Discussion Conference. He has now completed his work and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Shanghai-Wuxi express train. A reporter from the Shen Shi News immediately went to visit him and he discussed several points, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Establishment Period of the Cooperation Department</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, the Ministry of Industry has long planned to establish a Cooperation Department to handle national cooperative affairs. Since I was appointed to the position, I have discussed the preparatory procedures with Minister Chen several times, and they are mostly in place. After the China Foreign Relief Association has made some progress in disaster relief, the department can be officially established around the middle of next month. With my years of experience in handling rural cooperative affairs, I believe there will be no special difficulties in planning and managing the national rural cooperative professional movement. It is expected that this movement can be popularized in all rural areas across the country within two years.</p>
<p>National Rural Conference</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Shuming, Mr.晏阳初, and other gentlemen participated in the "National Rural Work Discussion Conference" held in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. The conference lasted for three days. In addition to reporting on the achievements and progress of rural work in various places over the past year, the most important topic was to connect various rural work groups and workers across the country to form a complete and systematic process. The effectiveness of the work should also achieve very satisfactory and rapid results in the future. However, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the successive oppression of floods and droughts in recent years, this work is even more important. Therefore, the convocation of the National Rural Work Discussion Conference, in addition to the discussion of work methods, is to unite the national power to break through this difficulty. Finally, it is said that the China Foreign Relief Association is also working very hard on rural construction work, and its achievements over the years are also very impressive. When it is convenient, the process of the association's handling can also be reported in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e103">The City Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Ministry of Finance a Response Regarding the Overlapping Taxation of Native Sugar <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a response to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that it was responding to an inquiry. It was found that on September 26 of this year, it received Instruction No. 188897 from the Ministry on September 24, ordering it to conduct a thorough investigation of the names, tax rates, standards, commissioned or contracted arrangements, annual tax revenue, whether there was double taxation, and whether the tax regulations had been submitted to the provincial and municipal governments for approval for the collection of native sugar donations and taxes in various provinces and cities, and to report the findings in detail. Upon receiving this order, it was considered that there was no native sugar production in the city, and there was no case to accumulate regarding the taxation situation. Letters were sent to the Shanghai Chaozhou Sugar, Grocery Industry, and Sugar Industry Associations, ordering them to investigate and report on each item in detail. According to the reply from the Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Industry Association, the association did not know the truth about the taxation of Chaozhou native sugar. Therefore, the situation was forwarded to the Shantou City Native Sugar Industry Association, requesting it to investigate and reply promptly on the various native sugar donation and tax matters inquired about in the Ministry's order. According to the reply, it was stated that the Ministry of Finance, in order to maintain native sugar and revitalize industry, ordered an investigation into the native sugar donation and tax situation in various provinces to provide relief. I respectfully submit the following regarding the obstruction of Chaozhou native sugar production: (1) The collection of native sugar donations in Chaozhou originally existed, but local groups submitted petitions stating that it was a policy that harmed the people and was harsh, and the government approved an order to abolish it. However, Huilai, Jiaoling, and other counties in Chaozhou still have the practice of collecting native sugar transit donations. Whenever native sugar is transported from these counties to Shantou, it is levied under the pretext of local expenses. The amount of each donation is more than 20 yuan per hundred packages. If they are not satisfied with the levy, they will be detained. Local farmers are subjected to this local harsh tax and dare to complain but dare not speak out. How can the weak and small bear this suffering? It is requested that you present this petition to the government to issue an order prohibiting this practice to relieve the people's difficulties. (2) The Guangdong Provincial Property Management Office, under the guise of reviving the countryside and maintaining the sugar industry, implemented native sugar registration, suspended transportation, and purchased sugar, depriving people of their freedom to trade. Various groups in Chaozhou stated that native sugar is the only source of livelihood in Chaozhou, and the rural economy depends on it for maintenance. If transportation and purchasing are suspended, it is no different from driving people to death. They sent telegrams to the constitutional officials, earnestly requesting the abolition. Although improvements have been made, transportation and sales still require licenses and registration. Native sugar is subject to obstruction, the root cause is the impediment to development. Farmers are wary and dare not plant sugarcane, watching famine. In this autumn of rural bankruptcy, when the people are poor and money is exhausted, the impact on local people's lives is unimaginable. It is requested that you present this petition to completely abolish the harsh regulations such as registration and licensing to reassure the people and industry. (3) Chaozhou native sugar is pure and beautiful, with a soft and moist color, sweet and sour, which is completely different from foreign sugar, which has a bright, hard, and clean color. Recently, the Jianghai Customs has regarded the native white sugar transported to Shanghai as having a slight radiance and suspected that it was mixed with foreign sugar. As a result, native white sugar was indiscriminately taxed as foreign sugar, which actually obstructed domestic production. The raw materials of both native and foreign sugar are made from sugarcane, and there is no difference in quality. The only difference is the color due to the different processes of manual and mechanical manufacturing. Chaozhou sugar manufacturing still uses old methods and replaces mechanical manufacturing with manual labor. Therefore, the sugar produced, except for green sugar, which is baked with fire and has no sand or radiance, the remaining white powdered sugar, stick sugar, and red sugar are all made by squeezing cane juice and using soil to remove moisture. After a month, the top end is white sugar, and the bottom end is stick sugar. These sugars all have radiance and sand. The Jianghai Customs does not investigate the quality of the sugar, regardless of the origin, and indiscriminately taxes it as foreign sugar because of the radiance and sand, which is the most unjust thing in the world. It is requested that you present this petition to strictly order the Jianghai Customs to verify the quality of the sugar and not to indiscriminately tax it. (4) Chaozhou red sugar is yellow and of poor quality, and the price is low. According to precedent, the tax was levied on yellow sugar when transported to Shanghai, which is different from the tax rate of Baiji. Recently, the Jianghai Customs has ordered red sugar to pay Baiji tax because the color of red sugar is similar to the standard of No. 11 sugar set by the Ministry, which has increased the tax rate and increased the price. Selling cheap goods at high prices has blocked sales channels. The Jianghai Customs' actions are sufficient to suppress production and impede the opportunity for development, which runs counter to the Ministry of Finance's intention to maintain native sugar. It is requested that you present this petition to strictly order a stop to maintain the sugar industry. (5) Since the opening of the five ports for trade, foreigners have taken the opportunity of the trade treaty to invade the market with foreign sugar. The sales market of native sugar has been deprived, and the livelihood has declined. Fortunately, the government cares about the people's livelihood, increases tariffs, and reduces the surtax. Native sugar can obtain a glimmer of hope. However, in recent years, due to the collapse of the rural economy and the decline in production, it has been restricted by the Guangdong Property Management Office's native sugar registration and transportation licensing, and burdened by transit taxes, resulting in stagnant sales. Foreign sugar takes advantage of the opportunity to import and dump goods, and cannot compete with them. The livelihood of native sugar is becoming increasingly exhausted, profits are leaking out, and the country's economic lifeline is in danger. In order to maintain the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is necessary to exempt native sugar from transit taxes to benefit native products. It is requested that you present this petition to exempt native sugar from transit taxes to close the loopholes. The above-mentioned points are only based on limited knowledge and are respectfully submitted in the letter. I hope that the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce will present this petition to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation to maintain agricultural production and benefit the people's livelihood. According to this, it is found that Chaozhou native sugar has been devastated by the heavy taxes and donations imposed by provinces, cities, and local governments over the years. Now that the government is determined to revive the countryside, it is the time when our people are looking forward to revival. Maintaining agricultural production is the key to this matter. In response to the inquiry, the facts are reported respectfully, and it is hoped that you will investigate and submit it to relieve the people's difficulties. According to this, the investigation and reply from the association, although slightly inconsistent with the various items mentioned in the Ministry's statement, the various oppressive situations are contrary to the Ministry's intention to maintain native sugar and investigate and prohibit harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, the facts are reported respectfully, and it is hoped that you will review and approve the issuance of an order to investigate and prohibit them so that the local native sugar can be developed to be fair.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Declaration of the Reorganization Committee of the Press Industry Union <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Looking back at our Press Industry Union, it has been established for eight years. In these eight years, we have fought for the revolution and sought the welfare of the masses without any slackness. Although there have been twists and turns and repeated difficulties, our workers have been able to overcome them one after another with a spirit of great fearlessness. It is gratifying to the people of the country, and it is not difficult to imagine the integrity of our union's organization and the rectification of our steps. Now, the workers and others have been promoting the union for several years, and all industry unions have been reorganized according to law. However, our Press Industry Union has been delayed until now and still uses the old name. Although this has nothing to do with the organization of the workers and does not harm their interests, it obviously conflicts with national laws. At this time when the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, our workers should also be of one heart and one mind, and under the leadership of the party and government organs, strive for national survival and seek the welfare of the workers. We deeply feel the necessity of reorganizing according to law. Therefore, we are now ordered to reorganize and appoint Liu Debao, Hu Ziqi, Ju Zhixiang, Ni Zhengeng, Zhu , Ye Shigen, Zhang Maoguan, Zhang Ruiqing, Yin Xingeng, Wang Fan, Chen Jinrong, Ye Qiming, Ding Zhengchang, Lou Guoxiong, and Lu Shanben as political and theoretical committee members. After receiving the order, we took the oath of office on the 19th of this month. As for the press workers themselves, there will be no changes due to the reorganization, such as the maintenance of the original labor-capital contract, the protection of interests, the self-determination and autonomy of the workers, and we will never rely on others. The strengthening and expansion of the union must be promoted. All these things have been arranged and will not lose any benefits, abolish contracts, or relax the organization due to the reorganization. In the future, all workers will still adhere to the original purpose, work together under the leadership of the reorganization committee, seek the welfare of the society, and strive for the glory of the labor world. This is hereby declared.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Open Letter from the City Anti-Smoking Association to Citizens: Five Key Points for Registration of Smokers; Fellow Countrymen in the Black Sea, Quickly Wake Up! <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee issued an open letter to smokers regarding the registration of smokers: "Fellow countrymen who are sinking in the black sea, it has only been a hundred and several decades since opium harmed China (1840, the 20th year of Daoguang), but the extent of its harm and the depth of its victims have been unimaginable. Since the Republic of China, there have been more poisonous substances such as red pills, morphine, and heroin, which are more fierce and more rampant. If the opium poison of our country is not resolved in one day, the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will not wait for others, and we will burn ourselves. The reason why the harm of opium has reached this point is due to the oppression of foreign forces at that time, the help of corrupt officials, treacherous merchants, and unscrupulous people, and the fact that our countrymen are昏瞶recognizing poisonous substances as the supreme峰慰飲鴉to quench thirst cannot be shirked from their responsibilities. The 국민府 government, aware of the fierceness of the opium disaster, promulgated new anti-smoking laws in June of this year. Since then, this city has been actively proceeding based on the six-year policy of complete elimination. This association was established in July to bear the responsibility of坚察督促检举纠王设计调查. At the same time, the government began registering smokers. Up to now, more than 10,000 people have registered, and thousands of people have been admitted to hospitals for smoking cessation. However, judging from the large population of this city and the number of smokers, it can be seen that the number of registered people is only a fraction, and there are many people who are skeptical and watching. Today's registration will end at the end of this month, so the key points are listed in the article to advise: (1) This time, the government has the greatest determination to ban smoking and will eliminate all smoking in the country within six years in stages. It is definitely not the previous policy of '寓禁于'. (2) The registration deadline for smoking bans in this city is mandated to be at the end of the 24th year, and the automatic registration will end at the end of this month. There will be no extension. Compulsory registration will begin in November. (3) This ban on smoking is consistent across the country. Once a smoker loses the opportunity to register, there is no chance to avoid it or register elsewhere, and will be subject to the most severe punishment. (4) The significance of registration is a way for the government to show sympathy for smokers who are old, sick, and deeply addicted. It is by no means a way to诱人register and then force them to quit. (5) If a smoker requests to quit smoking during the registration period, it is also feasible and can go directly to the Public Security Bureau to request completely free treatment. It is hoped that smokers in this city will deeply understand this and quickly register with the Public Security Bureau within these ten days or so. Do not hesitate any longer and fall into the trap of the law."</p>

<h3 id="e108">Two Notices from the Jianghai Customs <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Tax Reduction for Exported Frozen Ducks; Extension of Ship Tax License</p>
<p>Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Ba Guisen, Tax Officer, issued two notices yesterday regarding the extension of the ship tax license period during the suspension period of ships and the tax reduction for exported frozen ducks.</p>
<p>Notice One</p>
<p>It is found that the tax reduction for exported frozen ducks was extended to the end of March of this year in the previous Notice No. 1428 on February 1st of this year. Now, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, from October 1st of this year to March 31st of the 25th year, all exported frozen ducks should still be taxed at 5% ad valorem. Therefore, we should comply with the order and notify all merchants. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Notice Two</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of exempting ships from tonnage tax during the suspension period requested by various shipping companies, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the extension of the ship tax license period according to the following rules: (1) Ships that have a legitimate reason to stop sailing at various ports in the country are allowed to extend the ship tax license according to the date of their suspension. However, if the shipowner intends to stop sailing their ship, they must notify the customs in advance, and the suspension period must be at least one month in order to enjoy the benefit of extending the validity period of the ship tax license. (2) Ships that have already stopped sailing, if they have stopped for one month or more, can extend their ship tax license for the number of days. The above two measures apply to both sea and river ships. If the ship tax license of all suspended ships expires during the suspension period, it will be extended according to the number of days from the suspension to the expiration of the license when the ship resumes sailing. All shipping operators are hereby notified. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<p>The Wulongchi Bathhouse at No. 85 Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession caught fire at around 3:30 yesterday morning. The flames spread rapidly and broke through the roof. The fire was like a prairie fire and spread to the two floors of buildings at No. 87 and No. 89 next door. The nearby patrolmen reported the fire to the Central Fire Department by telephone, and the fire trucks rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Because the fire was very strong, it took about two hours to extinguish it. As a result, all the buildings and property of the bathhouse were destroyed. Two waiters were burned while escaping from the fire. One, Ding Qitang, from Nanxun, 26 years old, burned his left arm. The other, Zhang Ahai, 31 years old, injured his hand. A night watchman, Zhang Chubao, from Nanxun, 50 years old, who lived on the street floor, was awakened from his dream after the fire broke out. He panicked and jumped out of the window, injuring himself internally. The firefighters summoned an ambulance and flew him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. During the fire, firefighter No. 371 was burned in his right hand while venturing into the fire. His colleagues also sent him to the工部局hospital for treatment. After the incident, reporters investigated and learned that the losses of Wulongchi exceeded 10,000 yuan. It is said that there was fire insurance.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Amidst the Price Increase of Telephones in This City, the Cost of Calls to England is Reduced by 30%; It is Hoped That the Telephone Company and the Municipal Council Will Pay Attention <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice News reported that the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession, disregarding the difficulties of businesses and ignoring the facts, wanted to increase prices without reason, which aroused the opposition of the entire city. The Municipal Council hired telephone experts from four countries to study the matter in detail, but so far there has been no specific solution. A reporter from the New Voice News, because this matter is related to the interests of the entire city, did not tire of seeking details and inquired from all parties. According to a gentleman who just returned from England, the British telephone authorities, due to the sharp decline in exports and the sluggishness of various industries in recent years, and because industry and commerce have also laid off employees and reduced salaries, implemented a large reduction in the dedicated line business in London City from October 1st of last year. The quarterly fee was reduced from one pound twelve shillings and sixpence to one pound six shillings. The telephone fees in other places, which were previously one pound seven shillings and sixpence, have now been reduced to one pound. The prices of group businesses and business operations have also been reduced accordingly (an average of 30% discount). The loss of the above telephone price reduction was 750,000 pounds in this fiscal year and should be 1.5 million pounds next year. However, it is generally believed that this policy will not only enable the development of telephone services, but also help the prosperity of industry and commerce, and indirectly increase telephone revenue. It is also stipulated that the original price will be restored when the market recovers. It is hoped that the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Municipal Council authorities, and the four-country expert committee will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Wife of the "King of Flower Associations" Falsely Accuses Someone of Robbery <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Accusation of Theft Stemmed from Anger at Extortion by Paramour; Sentenced to One Month Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>Yu Manman, a Shanghai native and former dancer, and wife of Liu Lianghong, the "King of Flower Associations," shouted "robbery" at 3:55 AM on the 18th of this month near the Xiaorongchang (Little Glory Place) on Dagu Road. When apprehended, she was taken to the Chengdu Road police station. She claimed that a man from Ningbo, whom she knew casually, had robbed her of jewelry and silver worth 289 yuan. However, after investigation by Chinese detective Wang Xichang, it was found that her account did not match the facts, and she was suspected of making a false accusation. She was subsequently prosecuted in the First Special District Court. Because she insisted that she had indeed been robbed, the trial was postponed, and she was granted bail. This was reported in this newspaper. However, because she could not find bail, she remained in custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui continued the interrogation in the Eighth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that, during the postponement, the defendant had made a statement at the police station, claiming that she had an affair with a man from Ningbo nicknamed "Butterfly Flower" four years ago and lived with him for about two months before breaking up. However, this "Butterfly Flower" had forbidden her from having affairs with other men and demanded money from her, and he frequently sought funds from her. On that day, she met him again at the Eight Immortals Bridge and he again borrowed 50 yuan from her, but was unsuccessful. He then took 11.2 yuan in paper money from her wallet. Because she was angry, she shouted "robbery," etc. After obtaining the statement, the police confirmed that there was indeed such a person as "Butterfly Flower" and requested the assistance of the Laozha police station in locating him, but they were unable to find him. Therefore, the defendant's false accusation in this case has been confirmed, and the court should sentence her according to Article 169 of the Criminal Law. However, since the defendant is a woman who acted out of momentary anger, and has expressed remorse, he requested a lighter sentence. He then presented the statement as evidence. When questioned, Wang Manman admitted that the statement was entirely true, and that she committed the act out of anger. She requested leniency. Judge Liu examined the statement and immediately announced the judgment in court: Wang Manman is sentenced to two months imprisonment for false accusation, suspended for two years.</p>

<p>Lu Jiarong of Yangzhou Died Buying Sorghum; The Assailant Has Disappeared</p>
<p>Lu Jiarong, a 48-year-old man from Yangzhou, resided at No. 2, Deshun Li, Wu Family Alley, Laiyi Ferry, Pudong. He had long been without steady employment, so he made a living selling hand-rolled cigarettes. Every day, he would set up a stall near the Pang Yutai rice shop at the northern end of Shenxiang Alley Bridge on Pudong Avenue. Next to his stall was Wang Linhai, a local boy (14 years old) who sold sorghum. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Lu asked Wang to buy a stalk. Wang asked for seven copper coins, but Lu only gave him five. Wang uttered harsh words, and Lu slapped him in the face to vent his anger. At that time, many people were watching. Suddenly, a man, seeing a grown man bullying a child, stepped forward to stand up for the boy. Without asking what had happened, he punched Lu in the chest twice. Lu immediately fell to the ground. The assailant initially thought he was faking it, but then saw Lu's expression change drastically and knew he had caused trouble. He ran away. Lu was still able to speak, so he hired a rickshaw to go to the Yangjiadu police station to request that the assailant be apprehended and investigated. He claimed that the person who had assaulted him had been instigated by the owner of the Pang Yutai rice shop. The police station, seeing that Lu's injuries were serious, immediately ordered him to be taken to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, he died en route due to the severity of his injuries. The rickshaw puller, in a panic, left the corpse in front of the rice shop. Afterwards, Lu's wife, Ms. Xu, asked the police station to investigate. The Yang Police Chief brought Wang Linhai, the boy who sold sorghum, and his grandmother, Ms. Shi, to the station. Wang also stated that the person who hit Lu had run away immediately after. The police chief, needing to question the rice shop owner about whether he had instigated the assault, sent for him, but the owner was not in the shop. Only the owner's wife, Ms. Pang Zhang (40 years old), was brought to the station. She denied that her husband had ordered anyone to use force. The police then took the deceased's wife and all the defendants to the District Court for questioning and reported the murder case to the court through the neighborhood chief, Jiang Hongqing, requesting an autopsy to be conducted this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Canadian Mr. Norlin Travels the World; Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Experienced Hardships Along the Way; Witnessed Customs of Various Places</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, Mr. Norlin, a 25-year-old Canadian, has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago on a grand tour around the world. A year ago, Mr. Norlin was an accountant for an insurance company in Toronto. He then went to his birthplace in Newfoundland and boarded a Norwegian freighter to England. He had previously studied in England. He then took a Russian ship from London to Leningrad, then took a train to Moscow, where he met the late American humorist Mr. Rogers. He then took a train to Kharkov, experiencing hardships along the way. He then saw men and women bathing together, half-naked, at Sevastopol on the Black Sea. He then took a small boat to Eupatoria. When he slipped while boarding the deck, he was fined 25 rubles. He then traveled through Tiflis to the Persian border. Customs officials identified him as a wanderer and blocked his entry. He then presented 500 shares of mining stock, which allowed him entry. He then took a car into Bojing (and) Tehran. Although the road was very flat, he spent the night in a mud house. He then went to the holy city of Meshed. It happened that the King of Persia was visiting the city's Great Mosque. As the King passed, the police ordered passersby to prostrate themselves on the ground to prevent assassination attempts. He then took a car to Quetta in Baluchistan. The car had an armed escort to protect against tribal attacks. He then passed through India, through Delhi, Benares, Calcutta, etc. When he arrived in Chittagong, he was invited to speak at the Law Library. As he was going to the library, gunshots suddenly rang out. Everyone rushed to him, thinking he had been shot. He then bought a bicycle and traveled through Assam to the Khasi Hills, where women ruled and men obeyed. He asked a man why they did not fight for independence. He replied, "There is no need." He then crossed the Manipur state into Burma, passing through forests and carrying his bicycle up and down mountains along muddy roads into Mandalay. At one point he was warned not to buy food from the scholars, because it was their custom to poison those whom they respect, to please the gods. He then entered Siam, where life was better. At night, he could stay in Buddhist temples. He then traveled along the railway line through the Malay Peninsula to Penang and Surabaya, where he lectured at various schools. He then arrived at Segamat in the state of Johor. His bicycle suddenly broke down en route, and he spent the night in a thatched hut in the wilderness, hearing the sounds of beasts. He peeked out and saw a huge tiger in the moonlight. Mr. Norlin stayed in Malaya for three months, then took a boat to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. He plans to go to North China, Korea, and Japan, and then return to Canada. Mr. Norlin's travel expenses are gradually running out, and he plans to give lectures in Shanghai clubs or schools to raise funds to complete his trip around the world. According to the Zi Lin Bao, Mr. Norlin's travel expenses at the beginning of his journey in April 1934 were less than 100 pounds, which were used up before he reached Singapore. He then raised travel expenses by giving lectures. To date, he has spent less than 500 pounds, and what he has seen and heard cannot be achieved even with a rich traveler's expenditure of 10,000 gold coins. Mr. Norlin plans to travel again after returning to Toronto, but this time as a journalist. Because he has written travelogues for various newspapers during this trip, he already has a wealth of experience in the journalistic profession.</p>

<p>Architecture &amp; Aviation</p>
<p>The National Building Materials Exhibition held by the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Aviation Simple Exhibition held by the Shanghai Recruitment Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association are located in the new building of the Engineering Materials Testing Institute in the city center and next to the tennis court behind the athletic field of the National Games, respectively. Since the opening on the 10th of this month, many people have visited the exhibitions every day, especially the aviation exhibition, which has attracted the largest number of visitors because athletes from various provinces visit them during their free time. Since the National Games are scheduled to close today, it seems unnecessary to extend the exhibition period. Therefore, it has been decided to close them this afternoon.</p>
<p>Wood Carving &amp; Art</p>
<p>The wood carving and art exhibitions are both located on the 134th floor of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Amiral Foch in the French Concession. Since the opening on the 10th, many people have visited them. The art exhibition was originally scheduled to last for ten days, but because the Chen Liechu (arranger/place) made an agreement with the Jue Lan Society to hold an art exhibition, it was brought forward to close on the 17th. The wood carving exhibition is scheduled to hold a closing ceremony at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>

There was also a complete set of radio transmitting and receiving demonstration equipment attached to the International Radio Station, which also attracted attention. Other notable items included telephone statistics charts hanging on the four walls. There were so many beautiful and exquisite things to see. A document entitled "The Establishment and Development of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications" was printed and distributed to the audience, so that they could understand the internal situation of the bureau and the arrangement of domestic and foreign telephone bureaus.

<p>Since the Italo-Abyssinian War broke out, various import and export companies, fearing that the war would be prolonged, have stopped ordering goods. Recently, because the League of Nations decided to impose sanctions on aggressor nations, the situation in Europe has become increasingly tense, with a great sense that war could break out at any moment. Our country's Ping-Shui green tea has always accounted for a large proportion of exports. In recent years, due to the dumping of tea by the Dutch East Indies and Ceylon, most of the European and American markets have been taken over by them. As a result, foreign sales have plummeted. The British merchants Jardine Matheson, Jardine Henderson and other foreign firms in this city, in view of the increasingly tense situation in Europe and the potential for transportation disruptions once the war expands, have been buying large quantities of tens of thousands of boxes in advance. The market price has also risen by five yuan as a result. Moroccan tea merchants are also buying as much as possible, and there is a trend for prices to continue to rise. According to people in the tea industry, this kind of price increase is difficult to sustain and is purely due to market fluctuations.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Lu Xihou Sues Judge Case Concludes: Judge Yu Changzi Is Found Not Guilty; Lu Requests Withdrawal of Lawsuit, Presiding Judge Does Not Approve; Judge Yu Explains Reasons for Being Accused, Expresses Outrage <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>—Court Verdict: Yu Changzi Not Guilty, Lu Also Forgoes Appeal—</p>
<p>Yu Changzi, a judge in the Civil Division of the Shanghai First Special District Court, has served for four years, known for his integrity and public service, and highly regarded by his superiors. Last winter, the China Industrial Bank, managed by Lu Xihou, collapsed. Lu was arrested by the police on charges of fraud and embezzlement. After preliminary investigation by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, the court transferred Lu's petition to manage the bank's liquidation to the Civil Division. Judge Yu was assigned to handle the case, and after repeated court sessions,</p>
<p>he summoned parties involving price rights and debts for thorough interrogation. He also appointed an accountant to liquidate all the accounts and once detained Lu in the civil detention center. This summer, Lu sought to reconcile with creditors and drafted a settlement plan, which he submitted to Judge Yu for review. Based on this, a notice was issued to all creditors. However, Lu believed that the settlement terms stated in the notice differed significantly from his original proposal, which he considered detrimental to him. Therefore, he entrusted a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Judge Yu with the First Special Court for falsifying private documents, requesting that he be prosecuted under Article 210 of the Criminal Law (which stipulates that anyone who forges or alters private documents to the detriment of the public or others shall be sentenced to</p>
<p>imprisonment of not more than five years). Wu Zehan, a judge in the Criminal Division, was assigned to handle the case. Last month, during a court session presided over by Judge Wu, Lu Xihou again requested a transfer of jurisdiction, arguing that since the defendant was a current judge of the First Special Court, it would be inappropriate for him to be tried in the same court, and the plaintiff sincerely believed it was inconvenient and could not agree. Therefore, he requested a transfer of jurisdiction, designating another court to handle the case. Judge Wu then suspended the proceedings pending instructions from the higher court. Currently, Lu's request for a transfer of jurisdiction has been rejected, and the First Special Court will continue to handle the case according to law. Judge Wu then</p>
<p>issued subpoenas and sent police officers to serve both parties, scheduling a public hearing at 1:30 PM yesterday in one of the court's courtrooms. When Lu filed the lawsuit, the outside world paid close attention because the defendant was a current judge and the accusation came from someone subjected to judicial interrogation in the court where the judge served. In particular, creditors of the failed bank and the legal community were highly concerned. However, the bank's bankruptcy petition has now been approved by the court, and Lu Xihou has also realized that filing the lawsuit was too hasty. He specifically submitted a request to withdraw the lawsuit, so the atmosphere</p>
<p>suddenly eased. When the court session began, only the plaintiff, the defendant, and Li Jiachuan, the clerk of Judge Yu who was subpoenaed as a witness, appeared. In addition, there were only a few people in the audience. After presiding Judge Wu Zehan and Prosecutor Song Genshan took their seats with the court clerk, Lu Xihou went to the plaintiff's position and stated that the bank had been declared bankrupt by the court, and he requested to withdraw the lawsuit he had filed. Judge Wu stated that under the current criminal procedure law, the lawsuit could not be withdrawn and ordered the hearing to proceed as usual. He then interrogated Li Jiachuan about the procedures for handling the bank's liquidation and issuing the settlement notice. Prosecutor Song then rose and argued that even if the issued</p>
<p>copies and excerpts were not identical, the parties concerned could raise objections in the future, and there was no credible evidence that Lu Hou had suffered any damage. The crime of falsifying private documents was not established at all. The court then questioned Lu about whether he had consulted with his lawyer before filing the lawsuit. Lu admitted that he had consulted with his lawyer, who said that he could file the lawsuit in this way, so he proceeded with the lawsuit. Although the lawsuit was drafted by a lawyer, the draft was prepared by a friend. Then, defendant Yu Changzi stated the process of handling the bank's liquidation and the reasons for Lu's accusation against him, saying that he had been handling the case diligently for several months,</p>
<p>proceeding according to law. Lu knew about the notice of settlement plan that was sent out. The reason why he suddenly sued me was: (1) When I took over the case, I had Lu detained for three days, and he held a grudge in his heart. (2) Because there were 278,000 accounts, Lu asked to be allowed to declare his claims, but I rejected the request as unjustified according to law, so he could not profit from it and abused the lawsuit to intimidate me. Recently, I have received many letters exposing his insider information, so I applied to the president for recusal on August 20. At that time, accountant Li Dinghui came to visit specifically</p>
<p>to persuade me to concede, allowing the declaration of that huge sum of 278,000, and Lu would withdraw his lawsuit against me. I said that I could not be a judge, but I would never break the law, and I refused sternly. Now that Lu is bankrupt, I am unwilling to file a counterclaim against him, but I ask the prosecutor to pay serious attention to Lu Xihou's abuse of lawsuits and false accusations against judges. His attitude while speaking was</p>
<p>extremely agitated, and his anger was evident in his words, moving many who heard him. After Judge Wu finished the interrogation, he immediately announced the verdict, the main text of which stated that Yu Changzi was not guilty, and he said to Lu Xihou, "Based on the evidence you presented, the case cannot be established at all. Although you have submitted a request to withdraw the lawsuit, are you convinced by today's verdict, or do you still need to reserve the right to appeal?" Lu did not hesitate and immediately said, "I forgo the appeal." Therefore, this case can be said to have concluded here.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Ningbo Railway Workers' Union, the news of colleagues wishing to donate their accumulated membership fees of over 900 yuan to aid flood victims in various provinces has been reported in various newspapers. Colleagues of the section elected eight people, including Zhang Guangming, Jiang Bensheng, He Bingyong, Nong Jun, Yun Minggang, Ji Guoliang, Zhong Xinsheng, and Yao Shenzhi, as representatives of all colleagues to transport the accumulated membership fees of 900 yuan to Shanghai on the 12th of this month and submit them to the Party Headquarters of the two railways for verification and transfer to the Central Financial Committee for distribution. On that day, Chen Chengshi, Li Dagong, and Song Chuanji, the three standing committee members of the Special Party Headquarters of the railway, received them and hosted the representatives for lunch at the Xinya Restaurant on North Sichuan Road. The committee members in charge of receiving the remaining funds from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Branch of the former Two Railways Union issued a notice to all colleagues, excerpted as follows: Greetings to all. It has been found that the remaining funds of the former Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Branch of the Two Railways Union amount to 875.72 yuan for food expenses and 847.98 yuan for special donations. At the initiation of Mr. Wu Baowei and other former members of the branch, the donations will be returned, and the membership fees will be used for flood relief to show a small token of human mutual assistance. With the unanimous approval of colleagues, Zhang Guangming and seven others were elected as members of the committee to receive and handle the remaining funds. In order to fulfill the great wishes of colleagues, Guangming and others dared not measure their own abilities and respectfully accepted the task.

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document yesterday to the various courts in the city, stating, "Regarding the proposal that the main texts of civil and criminal judgments should be posted on the day of the judgment and published in newspapers, members have proposed that the main texts of civil and criminal judgments should be posted on the day of the judgment and published in newspapers the next day, which would be very convenient for the parties involved in the litigation. However, it has recently been found that many courts have failed to post the judgments on the day of the announcement or publish them in the newspapers the next day, which is inconvenient for the parties involved in the litigation. It is requested that this be forwarded to the various courts to pay attention to improving this matter." After a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members of the association, it was resolved to submit a request to the various courts that, in the future, in addition to posting the main texts of civil and criminal judgments on the day of the announcement, they should also be published in full in the newspapers the next day to ensure convenience, etc. Therefore, it is reasonable to submit the situation for your approval and implementation, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3 id="e128">City Chamber of Commerce Provides Guidance on Stamp Duty Issues for Deposit Slips, etc. <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Huashang Wax Candle Industry Association and Wenming Bookstore, providing guidance on issues related to stamp duty. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Deposit Slips</p>
<p>In reply to the Huashang Wax Candle Industry Association, "Your letter of the 17th of this month has been received and noted. The stamp duty for each deposit slip is 2 cents, and the stamp duty for each deposit booklet is 2 jiao per year. For savings deposits, regardless of whether it is a slip or a booklet, the stamp duty is generally 2 cents per item. The legislators have set this distinction in weight to encourage savings, in accordance with the principles of the Stamp Tax Law set by the Central Political Conference. Article 15 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that only deposit slips issued by savings businesses established in accordance with the Savings Bank Law can be subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the tax rate table. As for other stores, even if they accept savings deposits, they should still affix stamps in accordance with the regulations for deposit slips and cannot apply Article 9. This point must be conveyed to the industry for attention."</p>
<p>Stamp Duty on Stocks</p>
<p>In reply to Kaiming Bookstore, "Your letter of the 17th of this month has been received and noted. The restriction in the remarks column of Articles 16 and 17 of the Stamp Tax Law is because the term 'temporary subscription' has been issued for more than one year, and there are no formal stocks. This subscription certificate is already equivalent to a substitute for formal stocks and has acquired the status of a legal certificate. The one-year time limit in the remarks column is the standard for supplementary stamps, regardless of the reason why stocks have not been issued. Therefore, the two reasons mentioned by your company, the extension of the subscription period and the registration of capital increase, are subject to the above supplementary stamp conditions if the period from the issuance of the subscription certificate has exceeded one year. This is the view of the association. If your company believes that there are still doubts, you may continue to submit letters for research or submit them to the ministry for verification. As for Article 17 of that article, the statement that each item with a total amount of less than 10 yuan is exempt from stamps, not only does the Company Law Article 110 stipulate that those who pay in full at one time can take 10 yuan as one share, so there is no so-called share less than 10 yuan. This article refers to the actually paid shares in installments. However, the amount of each share paid in installments shall not be less than 20 yuan, and the amount payable for the first time shall not be less than one-half of the face value in accordance with Article 96 of the Company Law. Therefore, the shares paid in installments are at least 10 yuan per share, and there is no so-called share less than 10 yuan. Therefore, as your company's theory is that the sentence 'less than 10 yuan is exempt' becomes a formality."</p>

<h3 id="e130">Health Department Reports on Sanitation Conditions in Concessions Last Month <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to the Public Concession Health Department's report for September, the number of gastrointestinal diseases this month was significantly lower than in previous years. The reason is probably due to the pure weather last month, which made it difficult for diseases to breed. In normal times, September is actually one of the unhealthy months. Because during the summer heat, flies gather in shady places due to fear of the sun, and their activity is reduced. After the autumn coolness, they come out in droves, so the harm is more intense. Furthermore, autumn diseases in Shanghai are always brought in from other places and are closely related to those who go out to escape the summer heat. The reduction in autumn diseases in this port this year may also be due to changes in the locations where summer vacationers lived this year. In general, the number of autumn diseases that occur varies for different reasons, but September of this year can be considered smooth. In terms of common infectious diseases, those belonging to the digestive system have decreased, while those belonging to the respiratory system have slightly increased. Other diseases that have increased include malaria, which has increased by 45 cases, mostly among residents of the eastern and western districts. One foreign man, aged 28, died of rabies because he did not receive treatment. One foreign man and one Chinese woman, who had only been vaccinated once in their early years and had never been vaccinated in their lives, respectively, were infected with smallpox. Both of them have recovered. Furthermore, during the month of September, a total of 34,674 people were vaccinated against cholera, of which approximately 3,000 were rickshaw pullers registered for vaccination. In addition, 1,8992 people received the second vaccination. This is the end of the cholera vaccination period. Statistics for the entire summer season show that the number of people vaccinated against cholera was 194,331, and the number of people who received the second vaccination was 11,659. These numbers are slightly higher than in previous years, which may be one of the reasons why cholera did not occur in this port this year and gastrointestinal diseases decreased.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Dental Association, in order to raise public awareness of oral hygiene, has been preparing to hold an oral hygiene exhibition. The preparations have now been completed, and the exhibition will be open to the public at the YMCA on Sichuan Road starting next Monday (the 21st). The details are recorded separately below.</p>

Chen Weiqing, Huang Rende, Sun Xiamin, Wang Rongchu, He Ruisheng, and others of the association have been proceeding with the preparations since then, which have now been completed for three months. Due to the enthusiastic participation of the members, the preparations have been fully completed.

<p>The New Ningshao steamer of the Ningshao Shipping Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 16th. At 7:00 PM that evening, when the ship was in the Litongsha waters, a young passenger jumped into the sea from the stern of the steerage cabin. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea: The New Ningshao steamer left port for Ningbo at around 5:00 PM on the 16th. At 7:00 PM that evening, when the ship was passing Litongsha, a young passenger suddenly jumped over the stern balustrade into the sea from the stern of the steerage cabin. At that time, many of the passenger tea servers had not yet gone to sleep. After seeing this, they immediately reported to the purser. However, the ship was traveling very fast, and in an instant, it had sailed far from the place where the person had jumped into the sea, making it impossible to retrieve him.</p>
<p>Four Suicide Notes: Afterwards, four suicide notes were found on the left side of the balustrade. Two were written on postcards, one addressed to Ma Qizhou of the Baoxin Weaving Factory on Chezhan Road and one to Shen Huanmin of the Cuisen Tai Cigarette Factory at Xinzha Bridge. The other two were sealed in envelopes, one addressed to Gu Jingxian of Fumin Road and one to Shen Yuwei of the Shiyongchang Store in Shuanggang, Chongming. Except for those addressed and sealed, which were not opened, the words written on the postcards were bitter, including phrases such as "When a person reaches the end of the road, they reach the edge of the world." After the ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo, the tea servers delivered and mailed them to the addresses.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 1:00 PM, a moving company truck belonging to the Taiping Moving Company at No. 790 Beijing Road overturned into a river next to the road near Sunjia Bridge on Military Industry Road in Zhabei. This was because the road there was rugged and narrow, and the driver was careless. The driver, Xu Yu'en, a 25-year-old from Nantong, and laborers Chen Changbiao, a 42-year-old from Ningbo, and Zhou Yunlong, a 48-year-old from Suzhou, were all seriously injured, with their heads bleeding profusely. One employee and one laborer only got their clothes dirty and were not injured. At the time, villagers saw this and reported it to the police, who dragged everyone out of the truck and helped them ashore. Then, they hired a car to take them to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, the company was notified to send a car to try to pull the truck out of the river, but because the silt at the bottom of the river was too deep, it was not until evening that the truck was pulled out of danger.</p>

After moving out, she put broken cotton wadding into a reed bag, along with shredded paper, and placed it on a broken charcoal stove, abandoning the empty room. The sub-landlord Li Sun had no knowledge of this. Later, neighbors discovered that the empty room had a roaring fire and thick smoke, and they shouted loudly to help extinguish it, preventing a disaster. Li Sun thought that her former tenant Liu Fan was so vicious, setting a fire to cause harm, and that she was completely devoid of conscience. The neighbors were all outraged and immediately reported to the Yimiao Police Station, who immediately arrested Liu Fan. After questioning by Chief Liu, it was determined that the case involved arson with intent to harm, and she was handed over to the Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Lu Jintao, a 41-year-old man from Tongzhou, was walking through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route des Soeurs in the French Concession at 12:15 AM yesterday morning when he was spotted by Chinese police officer No. 560 of the Yuepu No. 184 patrol, who found his behavior suspicious. Upon searching him, a packet of red pills was found. He was taken to the Route Petain Police Station, where he confessed to buying them from Yan Maotou (76 years old, from Yangzhou), a boy living in a bungalow in Yangjiasha. The police chief dispatched detective Yin Bingnan to take Lu to the address, where Yan, the boy, and suspects Li Fusheng (29 years old, from Changzhou) and Li Wang (25 years old, from Changzhou) were arrested. Seven hundred and fifty red pills and a set of lamp stems were found on Wang's bed and in the kitchen. They were taken back to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court 2, where the police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the Anti-Smoking Law. When questioned, Lu confessed to buying the pills from Yan. When questioned, Yan Maotou confessed, "My father, Yan Hongzhang, was arrested on April 9 for selling red pills and sentenced to one year of imprisonment, which he is currently serving. These red pills were sent by Ming Hexing. Yesterday, Lu came to my house to smoke red pills for three cents and took away another three cents. After being arrested, when the patrolmen came to arrest me, I panicked and put my red pills on Li Wang's bed." When questioned, Li Wang and Li Fusheng both denied colluding with Yan Maotou to sell red pills. However, Li Fusheng admitted that he often went to smoke red pills without being addicted and just played around. After verification by Judge Wang Juexu, the sentence was reserved. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Young Woman Petitions for Divorce Mediation, Reason Being Husband's Abuse and Beating <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>A young Ningbo woman, Zheng Shujun, 22 years old, married Qu Quangen, a local man from Jumen Road outside Ximen, two years ago in September. The couple often had conflicts, and there was no peace at home. Recently, Zheng Shujun retained lawyer Tao Ran to petition the local court's mediation chamber for a divorce. Her only reason was that her husband was born with a violent nature and abused and beat her. Yesterday, Judge Sun Jikang opened the court to summon her. The petitioner Zheng Shujun, accompanied by lawyer Tao, appeared in court and stated that soon after the marriage, the respondent took the one hundred yuan deposit book that I had in the Bank of China, claiming to keep it for safekeeping, but in fact, he squandered it all. He also ordered me to go back to my mother's house to borrow money, but I refused because I found it difficult to speak. Therefore, the respondent hated me to the bone and abused me in every way. In October of last year, I was beaten and seriously injured. At that time, I still tolerated it, hoping he would change. Unexpectedly, the respondent thought that the petitioner was weak and could be bullied. Recently, he had a new love, and he became even more outrageous, saying that he would put me to death. In August of this year, he added fists and feet for no reason and pulled out a sharp knife to carry out murder. At that time, I reported it to the police. In such a situation, the feelings are truly broken. I request permission to divorce and ask for compensation for living expenses, etc. When questioned, the respondent Qu Quangen, 24 years old, a coppersmith by trade, stated that all the things she said were not true. He did not want a divorce and asked to be reconciled. After hearing the statements, the judge believed that the statements differed from each other and that mediation was not possible. He ordered the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit separately.</p>

<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Little friends! Today I come to talk to you about the issue of charity.</p>
<p>Our China is really unfortunate to the extreme. It is either a drought or a flood. When it breaks out, it is not just a matter of one county or one province, but it is easily a matter of ten or eight provinces. Think about it, China only has so many provinces, but those who suffer from disaster account for about two-fifths of them. In these disaster-stricken provinces, almost 100 million people are suffering! They have no place to live, no clothes to wear, and nothing to eat, and they are hungry and cold day and night. Sometimes, because they cannot bear the oppression of hunger and cold, they would rather throw themselves into the rolling torrents, sacrificing their precious and pitiful lives. Those children, who do not know anything, are just crying for hunger and cold. Aren't all these tragic and heartbreaking situations really like hells on earth?</p>
<p>Yes, they are in hell on earth, suffering from unbearable disasters, but you, my dear children, are in heaven! You have not encountered water and drought disasters, and you do not lack the satisfying enjoyment of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. You should be happy. But I deeply hope that you children will think about the many pitiful children who are suffering in the disaster areas while you are happy, and find ways to help them.</p>
<p>There is no other way to help them, but to donate some money or clothes to them within your ability. Look, there is a child in this city named Situ Zupei, who personally brought his candy money, which he had saved up on weekdays, totaling fifteen thousand nine hundred and ninety yuan, to this newspaper office on September 15, and asked this newspaper office to forward it to the flood relief association to help the disaster victims. We feel that Situ is really a respectable and lovely primary school student! He would rather not buy snacks for himself and take this money to help the victims, how comforted he must be in his conscience! I hope that many children will also learn from Situ, save the money they spend on buying candy, and send it to this newspaper office or the flood relief association to do a great deed!</p>
<h3 id="e163">Ji Chang Learns Archery <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>Whether pursuing education, undertaking tasks, or practicing a skill, if one can be focused and persistent, any difficult job can surely be completed. If you don't believe me, please read the following story.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was an excellent archer named Gan Ying. His skills were extremely high. No matter what birds or beasts, no matter their size, distance, or height, as long as he could see them, he would never miss. Gan Ying had a disciple named Fei Wei. After Fei Wei practiced for a long time, his skills surpassed Gan Ying's. Fei Wei also had a disciple named Ji Chang. After Ji Chang practiced for a long time, his skills surpassed Fei Wei's.</p>
<p>When Ji Chang first arrived at Fei Wei's place to learn archery, Fei Wei said to him, "If you want to learn archery, you should first train your eyesight. When your eyes are open, no matter what is thrust at you, your eyeballs should not move, and your eyelids should not close. When you have learned this preliminary skill, I will then teach you the technique of drawing the bow and shooting arrows."</p>
<p>Ji Chang returned home and secretly thought about how he could learn the skill that his teacher had mentioned. It so happened that his wife was weaving cloth on a loom, and the bar that moved on the loom and the board that one stepped on beneath the loom moved up and down constantly. Therefore, he thought of a method for training his eyesight. He lay on his back under the loom, with his eyes open, watching the moving bar and board. When the bar and board moved to his eyelashes, he felt some discomfort at first, but after two years, it became second nature, and he didn't feel it at all. Even if a very sharp awl point pricked his eye, his eyeballs would not move, and his eyelids would not close.</p>
<p>Ji Chang learned this skill and happily went to see Fei Wei, thinking that he could now learn the technique of drawing the bow and shooting arrows. Unexpectedly, Fei Wei said to him, "It's too early. You have only learned to keep your eyeballs still and your eyelids from closing. You haven't yet trained your vision. You must make the smallest things appear bigger and the finest things appear clearer. When you have learned this second skill, come see me again."</p>
<p>Ji Chang had no choice but to return home again. After thinking for a while, he came up with a method for training his vision. He took a hair from a cow's tail, tied a flea to it, and hung it by the window. He stared at it with his eyes open all day long. Strangely enough, after ten days, the tiny flea appeared to him to gradually enlarge. In this way, after three years, it looked as big as a cartwheel. At this time, he didn't ask his teacher for instructions. He picked up a very small bow and arrow, aimed at the flea, and with a whoosh, shot it right in the heart.</p>
<p>Then, he went to report to Fei Wei. Fei Wei happily said to him, "Good, you have already learned the secrets of archery. You don't need me to teach you anymore!"</p>
<h3 id="e164">Earthworm <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Every morning, Min'er often saw mounds of soil piled up on the grass. He felt very strange and went over to see what they were. He saw a small hole next to each mound of soil. He didn't know what kind of animal's hole it was.</p>
<p>"Brother Cong, are those small holes over there ant holes?"</p>
<p>"No, those mounds of soil are not actually soil, but the excretions of earthworms. That hole is the hole made by the earthworm."</p>
<p>"Oh! So it's an earthworm hole. The farmers say that they eat the roots of crops, so they often use them to feed the ducks. Why do nature books say that they are beneficial to crops?"</p>
<p>"The farmers mistakenly believe that they are harmful animals. In fact, they eat the fallen leaves and do not eat crops. They can loosen the soil, making it easier for oxygen and nitrogen in the air to reach the soil. Because plants need these gases to grow, they can gradually turn barren soil into fertile soil."</p>
<p>"Brother Cong, I often see earthworms, but is their structure very complex? Do they have mouths and eyes?"</p>
<p>"Earthworms like to live in moist soil in holes. They have a total of about one hundred and forty segments. The fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth segments are called the clitellum, and their color is very light. The remaining segments are pale red on the ventral side and brown on the dorsal side. How do you know which is the head and which is the tail? The one closer to the clitellum is the head; otherwise, it is the tail. Its mouth is shaped like a valve and is very small; you have to magnify it to see it. However, it has no eyes, but its skin can distinguish the intensity of light. It also has no ears, so its hearing is not sensitive. What's even stranger is that it has no distinction between male and female, so it is hermaphroditic."</p>
<p>"Some people say, 'When earthworms sing, there won't be much rain.' Brother, can earthworms sing?"</p>
<p>"This is just a common saying and is completely untrue. The reason people think earthworms can sing is a misunderstanding. Actually, it's the mole cricket that's calling."</p>
<h3 id="e165">Autumn Insect Variety Show <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Junpeng</p>
<p>Half of autumn has already passed, and various autumn insects are extremely active. In a very beautiful garden with luxuriant flowers and plants, a cricket met a textile insect and said, "Time flies so fast! More than half of autumn has already passed. We don't have much time left to live. Why don't we take this opportunity to invite some companions and hold an 'Autumn Insect Variety Show'? Wouldn't that be extremely interesting and fun?" The textile insect said, "I'm very troubled by my work, and I also want to find some happiness. I very much agree. Let's make a plan to put it into practice with some friends tomorrow!" The cricket smiled and said, "Good! Good! We will definitely put it into practice tomorrow."</p>
<p>The next morning, the cricket invited some of its kind, as well as tree crickets, katydids, mole crickets, grasshoppers, etc. The textile insect also invited some, including bagworm moths, dragonflies, cicadas, butterflies, moths, etc. The setting for the show was natural and in a very beautiful garden, so there was no need to decorate it. Therefore, the cricket, textile insect, etc., didn't have to make any effort, and the variety show began at nine o'clock that day. Mantises and ants were guest performers.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!... It was nine o'clock. The cricket chirped a few times to indicate that the variety show was about to begin. The guests at the event included earthworms, bees, flies, mosquitoes, centipedes, fireflies, etc. In a moment, only the sound of tree crickets, *de ling, de ling*, playing music could be heard. The venue became quiet. Then, the tree crickets stopped playing, and the jasmines played *de ling, de ling* even more elegantly and pleasingly. At the same time, pairs of beautiful butterflies, dressed in extremely gorgeous clothes, danced up and down in time with the music, as light as swallows, making the audience cheer. After the butterfly dance was over, dragonflies came out to perform aviation techniques, circling left and right in the sky, making various gestures of catching insects, and also inviting several companions to form a triangular formation, like bombing planes, performing even more wonderfully, with non-stop applause. Then, there was an ant race for five hundred meters and one hundred meters, a grasshopper high jump competition, and later, a guest mantis came up to try out a short sword. Next, the cricket performed wrestling. One yellow cricket and one black cricket were all majestic and high-spirited, baring their teeth and drumming their wings, as if facing a formidable enemy, preparing to wrestle. First, the black one attacked the yellow one, then lunged left and right, advancing and retreating, without any clear winner, each chirped once and then stopped. The textile insect spun the yarn back and forth! back and forth! , and the bagworm moth weaved a piece of cloth, and that was it.</p>
<p>Children! What do you think after watching the "Autumn Insect Variety Show"? If it seems familiar to you, you might as well go back and hold an "Autumn Variety Show" too.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Blacksmith <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Fire</p>
<p>One day, after Min'er had dinner, he went to the street to buy something. He ran to a blacksmith shop, where three or four blacksmiths were busily working at their trade. Their faces were covered with a lot of black charcoal dust. The sweat on their bodies flowed like rain, and their clothes were extremely filthy. Therefore, Min'er asked them, "Why are your clothes so unclean?" One of the blacksmiths replied, "Although our clothes are unclean, we make great contributions to mankind. Such as the scissors used by seamstresses, the saws and planes used by carpenters, etc., are all products of our blood and sweat."</p>
<p>Min'er felt that what he said made a lot of sense. He also thought that although their profession was humble, their contributions were so great! Children, I hope that when you grow up, you will definitely do things that are beneficial to society and not engage in occupations that are useless to mankind, so that you will not be ashamed of the blacksmiths!</p>
<h3 id="e167">Frog and Archerfish <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Yide</p>
<p>A frog in a hot place was standing on the riverbank, croaking and croaking incessantly, self-satisfied. The meaning of its croaking, translated, is: I am a frog, my honor is the word "beneficial insect". I can catch pests and protect the five grains. My contribution is great. Who can compare to me! Who can compare to me!</p>
<p>An "archerfish" heard the frog's croaking and became very impatient. It swam to the surface of the water and said to the frog, "Hey! I already know that you are a frog, a beneficial insect that can catch pests. But do you know me?"</p>
<p>The frog immediately stopped croaking and looked at the "archerfish," answering proudly, "I know you. I know you're just an ordinary fish!"</p>
<p>The archerfish said, "Do you know my name? Do you know my skills?"</p>
<p>The frog still said proudly, "I'm not a zoologist, so how would I know you, an unknown nobody! But I know your skills. You can swim, right? Do you know? I can swim in the water, jump on land, and also catch pests! Please don't talk about your skills!"</p>
<p>The archerfish, hearing this, restrained its anger and replied, "Don't brag! You can catch pests, and I can also catch pests. You are a beneficial insect, so I am a beneficial fish. — Please see my skills!"</p>
<p>At this time, a pest happened to fly over, and the archerfish immediately shot water from its mouth like a fountain, shooting straight up three or four feet, knocking the pest down and swallowing it in one gulp.</p>
<p>The archerfish swallowed the pest and said, "What do you think of my skills? Shouldn't I be called a beneficial fish? But I don't like vanity. Although I shoot pests to eat every day, no one comes to call me a beneficial fish, which is of no concern to me. What I hate most is an arrogant attitude. Now, please leave my sight!" Saying that, it shot water from its mouth again like a fountain, hitting the frog on the head with water. The frog felt wet and painful and hurriedly fled.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Lighting a Lamp Underwater <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Shan'ai</p>
<p>Children: When you see this topic, you feel a little suspicious, right? I believe you will definitely say this: How can you light a lamp underwater? If you light a lamp, won't the water put it out! That's right: Water can put out a lamp, but we can use scientific methods to subdue it.</p>
<p>Children: If you want to do this game, you only need to prepare a box of matches, a short candle stub, a glass, a small wooden board slightly larger than the diameter of the glass, and a basin (filled with water). Once you have all the above items, you can start playing. When playing: First, light the candle (the wick should be shortened), and drip some of the wax onto the top of the wooden board to connect the wooden board and the candle. Then, put the wooden board into the basin of water. At this time, you can turn the glass upside down, hold it in your hand, and place it squarely over the candle and the wooden board, and press it into the water. You see, the candle is not only burning in the water as it does outside, but also shows many beautiful glows due to the rippling of the water.</p>
<p>Principle: Air is a "substance" of gas. In the world, no matter where, no matter what substance, as long as there is space, it will penetrate and occupy a considerable "space". When we press the cup into the water, the cup is already full of air. Therefore, the water in the basin cannot enter at all. If the water cannot enter, the lamp can burn as usual in the air in the cup.</p>

<p>While it was talking, I was leaning on one of my wings, propping myself up a little, eating with relish. The turtledove remained motionless, perched there, looking at me with pity. At the same time, it saw that I was very tired, looking around, and it understood that I was extremely thirsty. A drop of rain happened to be dripping on a piece of sea green grass from last night; it gently sipped up this drop of rain with its beak, brought it over, and sent it into my mouth, so fresh and pure. Of course, if I hadn't injured my body, someone with its status would never have treated me this way.</p>
<p>I didn't know what love was at that time, but my heart was beating very fast. I was emotionally moved, with a kind of unspeakable happiness. I looked at the two of them, so beautiful and gentle, waiting on me. I wished I could always have breakfast like this, but everything has an end, and so does a patient's appetite. After I finished breakfast, my strength had long since recovered. In order to satisfy the little magpie's curiosity, I told it my misfortune, as sincerely as I had told the pigeon last night. The magpie listened to me very attentively, and the turtledove showed me its goodwill at all times. But as soon as I talked about not knowing what I was since I was a child, the magpie cried out? "Are you trying to make us laugh? You are a mountain crow! You are a pigeon! Oh! Oh! Neither of those are right, you are a magpie, my dear child, you are indeed a magpie—and a very beautiful magpie." It fanned its wings at me slightly, as if fanning a feather fan.</p>
<p>I replied, "But my countess, it seems to me that my color is very much like a magpie. Please forgive me for being presumptuous, for saying such a thing..."</p>
<p>The magpie hurriedly said, "A Russian breed of magpie, my love, you are a Russian breed of magpie! Don't you know that they are all white? Poor child, how ignorant you are!"</p>
<p>I replied, "Madam, but I was born in an old broken bowl in the Mallee region, how could I turn into a Russian breed of magpie?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Dear heart! You are also a low-blooded type; do you think you are the only one who is like this? Everything is with me here, I will tell you what to do, and you will do as I say; at this moment, I will take you with me to see the best things in this world."</p>

<p>Athletics Field Crowded</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Hong Kong and Guangdong competed for the football championship. The first game was the third and fourth place final between Malaya and Shanghai. The four teams' athletes tried their skills again, fighting fiercely, and the situation changed dramatically. Jiangwan Road was full of football fans watching the game, and the number of excited people broke the record of the previous day. No less than several thousand school groups came from as far away as Nanjing and Suzhou to watch. Mayor Wu personally traveled around to direct the military police to maintain order. Tickets at all levels had already been sold out in the morning. The grand occasion was unprecedented. As a result, Hong Kong relied on the strength of the football king Li Huitang, who single-handedly scored three goals, defeating Guangdong 3-1 and winning this year's football championship. Malaya also defeated Shanghai 3-1. Shanghai won fourth place in this year's football tournament. Guangdong and Malaya were originally scheduled to play at 9 a.m. today to determine the runner-up, but Guangdong had already announced its withdrawal yesterday and will not play again. Malaya won the runner-up without any effort, and Guangdong was third.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Kicking Away Opportunities: Shanghai Suffers Another Defeat; Misses Second Penalty Kick, Ranked Fourth in Football Competition <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>In the previous day's match between Shanghai and Guangdong, the competition was fierce. Defender Li Ning was injured, and Dai Lin and Li Yichen were criticized for being slow. Therefore, the lineup was changed, with Xu Jingcheng and Jia Youliang as left and right wings, Chen Jiaqiu and Zhong Yongsen as inside forwards, and the young and energetic Sun Jinshun as center forward, leading the team. The team appeared completely refreshed and well-coordinated. Yesterday afternoon at 1 o'clock, Shanghai began the match against Malaya. Chen Jiaqiu, Jia Youliang, and Xu Jingcheng were the most active, but due to bad luck, the Shanghai team had several corner kick opportunities. Chen Jiaqiu's long shots and close attacks were unsuccessful. The Shanghai team's momentum was unstoppable, but the Malayan team's goal became the ultimate target. After 20 minutes of fierce fighting, neither side had scored.</p>
<p>Bad Luck, Wasted Efforts: Shanghai's left winger Xu Jingcheng was the most hardworking, penetrating deep along the side with speed and power, dribbling past the defense line several times. From a distance of more than ten yards from the goal, he powerfully shot, but due to bad luck, the ball missed by inches, wasting his efforts. At the 25th minute, Shanghai won another corner kick. The landing point was excellent. Zhong Yongsen got the ball and powerfully volleyed it towards the goal. Everyone thought it would definitely score, but unexpectedly, the goalkeeper dove and saved it. Thousands of spectators sighed in unison. The battle became even more intense.</p>
<p>Handball Penalty: Malaya Wins the Ball. In the 28th minute, Malayan inside forward Li Yiyao dribbled the ball and passed it to Xie Qingfu. Chen Zhenxiang intercepted the ball, but unfortunately committed a handball foul near the 20-yard line. Xie took the penalty kick, shooting directly at the goal. The ball was as fast as an arrow. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai jumped desperately and caught the ball. Unexpectedly, Li Yiyao charged forward. Zhang Rongcai panicked and accidentally released his grip. The ball flew past the goal line, only half a ball over the line. He quickly turned around and slapped it out, but the referee's decision was firm, and Malaya was declared the winner, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Besieged Unsuccessfully: Morale Dwindles. After losing a goal, the Shanghai team ordered a full-scale counterattack. The five forwards clashed left and right, engaging in close combat, but the front line was shaken. Zhong Yongsen, Chen Jiaqiu, Sun Jinshun, and Xu Jingcheng all had excellent scoring opportunities, but the goalkeeper's experience was abundant and his skills were agile, saving many dangerous shots. Despite the prolonged siege, they were unable to score. The Malayan goal was constantly in a state of crisis, but they were divinely blessed and managed to turn danger into safety. The Shanghai team was extremely tired, and their movements became slow, showing signs of dwindling morale. The first half ended with Malaya winning 1-0.</p>
<p>Two Penalty Kicks, Two Misses. After the break, the teams switched sides and continued the game. The Shanghai team was slightly invigorated after being injected with morphine. Five minutes into the second half, the Shanghai five forwards broke through two lines of defense, and in the ensuing melee, a Malayan defender touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Sun Jinshun took the penalty, and the crowd cheered, thinking they could equalize the score. Unexpectedly, the ball was kicked weakly and rolled along the ground. The goalkeeper pounced and caught the ball, causing great disappointment. People said Sun Jinshun was selling favors. Less than three minutes later, Shanghai won another penalty kick. Chen Jiaqiu took the kick, shooting powerfully like a cannonball towards the goal, but the goalkeeper lightly caught the ball again. The Shanghai forwards rushed to compete for the ball, but the goalkeeper didn't throw the ball far. Xu Jingcheng took another shot, but it was still unsuccessful. It was truly a doom for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Deng Hua Penalized Again: Another Goal. As the saying goes, misfortunes never come singly. Sure enough, in the 16th minute, Shanghai was also penalized with a penalty kick. Xie Qingfu took the kick, shooting calmly into the net at a 30-degree angle to the horizon, making it 2-0. The outcome was essentially decided. In the 25th minute, the Malayan team took a corner kick. Yao Shenghua passed to Xie Qingfu, who took advantage of the chaos and shot another goal, making it 3-0. The Shanghai team had entered the second stage of "pulmonary consumption" and was in an incurable state.</p>
<p>"Iron Leg" Scores: Prevents a Shutout. The Shanghai team reluctantly continued the game in dejected spirits. Fortunately, in the 27th minute, an opportunity arose. Jia Youliang broke through the encirclement alone and quickly passed to Sun Jinshun in front of the goal. From only five or six yards away, he lightly volleyed the ball into the net, preventing a shutout. Congratulations were in order. After that, the Malayan team's defense became stricter. After prolonged back-and-forth attacks, nothing was gained. Malaya won the second half 2-1. The total score was 3-1. The battle ended with Shen Siliang announcing that Shanghai had won fourth place in the football championship.</p>
<p>More Scoring Opportunities for Shanghai than Malaya. In yesterday's match between Malaya and Shanghai, Shanghai actually had more scoring opportunities than Malaya. In total, there were 25 excellent scoring opportunities throughout the match, but only one goal was scored, which was very undeserved. Malaya had 17 scoring opportunities and scored three goals. Their shooting accuracy was indeed higher than that of the Shanghai team. The Shanghai forwards had more courage than strategy and lacked calmness when dribbling the ball in front of the goal. The failure was inherently their own fault, but their bad luck should also be given some consideration.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the final of the Hong Kong and Guangdong football championship was held. The two sides were evenly matched, with exciting plays emerging frequently. The battle was extremely fierce, constantly in a state of suspense. Headers and footwork shifted back and forth in an instant, dazzling the thousands of spectators. Their expressions reflected extreme joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. The "King of Football," Li Huitang, displayed the same prowess as in his prime, scoring three goals single-handedly. The fans were ecstatic. Goalkeeper Bao Jiaping exhausted all his strength in defense, earning a round of applause. Besides, Hong Kong's left winger Zheng Jiliang and Guangdong's inside forwards Yang Shuiyi and Chen Zhenhe displayed skillful techniques, which were also highly appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p>Long-Range Shot from 20 Yards: "King of Football" Succeeds. At exactly 3 o'clock, the silver whistle blew, and the battle began. To show the importance of the final, Mayor Wu was specially invited to perform the opening kick. The mayor kicked the ball directly towards the Hong Kong side. Li Shaorong caught it squarely and flew forward. The two sides clashed, with attacks going back and forth. The Guangdong team closely marked the "King of Football," giving him few opportunities to be active. At the 55th minute, Li Huitang got the ball. In an instant, he crossed the defense line and powerfully shot, but the angle was slightly off, and the ball went out of bounds. At the 20th minute, Huang Shuikang accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a penalty. The spot was about ten yards from the goal. Li Huitang took the kick. Everyone inside and outside the stadium expected Li to pass to the left wing, but with a loud bang, the ball flew into the net. The Guangdong team was shocked and speechless. All the spectators applauded and cheered wildly, praising the "King of Football's" skills, which were indeed extraordinary. The beauty of his shooting posture, the clarity of the ball entering the net, and the strength of his wrists and feet could only be achieved by the "King of Football."</p>
<p>Goalkeeper's Saves: Great Contribution. The Guangdong team attacked fiercely. Yang Shuiyi, Li Hongqing, and Chen Zhenhe desperately attacked, engaging in several melees in front of the Hong Kong goal. Bao Jiaping dealt with the attacks from left, right, above, and below, using his fists and hands with ease. Hong Kong's victory was due equally to the "King of Football's" scoring and the goalkeeper's defense. At the 30th minute, the Guangdong right winger got the ball inside the defense line and powerfully shot. In a very critical situation, Bao Jiaping dived and slapped the ball out of bounds, forcing a corner kick. The whole stadium cheered wildly, praising him as being even better than the "Iron Gate" Zhou Xianyan. Less than a minute later, the three forwards charged out of the goal with the ball. Bao had already caught it, but the momentum was fierce, and he couldn't avoid being knocked down while holding the ball. He threw the ball out of danger from the gaps in the crowd's feet. He was truly calm in the face of danger and exceptionally intelligent.</p>
<p>Showing Skills Again: Second Triumphant Song. The Guangdong team, hindered by the goalkeeper, could not cross the line, and their offensive gradually weakened. Hong Kong's Cao Guicheng also repeatedly went offside. The battle situation became quiet. At the 40th minute, Hong Kong's Li Zhaorong passed the ball to Li Huitang. Surrounded by enemies on three sides, the "King of Football" used his most agile skills to break through a path. From 15 yards away, he kicked the ball diagonally, and the ball went in again, scoring two goals in a row, singing a second triumphant song. "Long live the King of Football!" The cheers deafened the ears. Later, Zheng Jiliang and Cao Guicheng's long-range shots and close attacks both went out of bounds. The first half of the battle also ended with this, with Hong Kong winning 2-0 and Guangdong losing.</p>
<p>Changing Lineup: Powerless. Hong Kong's Li Guowei was injured midway through the first half and replaced by Yang Benhan, who was still able to fight. During the break, the Guangdong team changed their strategy. Initially, because inside defender Mai Shaohan was injured the day before, Tan Jiangbai was internally transferred to consolidate the defense, and He Zuoxian was appointed as center forward. The attacking power was suddenly weakened. In the second half, Jiang Bai was again appointed as forward, and Xie Kui replaced the defender, taking an offensive stance. However, it was still difficult to overcome the "Iron Gate," and they were unable to reverse the decline. At the beginning of the second half, the Guangdong team came like an overwhelming flood, invading the Hong Kong side's territory. The five forwards took turns charging and attacking, but all failed. In the third minute, Guangdong was awarded a corner kick. Chen Zhenhe kicked the goalkeeper before the ball arrived. The referee blew the whistle to penalize the foul. The ball also went into the net, so it was declared invalid.</p>
<p>"King of Football" Wins Thrice: Overwhelming Momentum. In the sixth minute, Zheng Jiliang got the ball and used his speed to penetrate deep into the enemy territory. The enemy rushed to catch up, and he quickly passed it to Li Huitang. The "King of Football" had been waiting for a long time and would not let go of this opportunity. He dribbled past the enemy camp several times and powerfully shot the ball into the goal. Three wins in three battles. The overwhelming momentum made the Guangdong team lose heart. Not long after, the "King" got the ball and flew towards the goal, but the goalkeeper was prepared. With a loud bang, the ball was caught. This was the first time the "King of Football" had failed.</p>
<p>"Black Coal" Is Brave: Causes Dispute. "Little Black Coal" Chen Zhenhe was the bravest, but he was too reckless. Because of the scramble for the ball, Huang Suanxun waited for the opportunity and had a small dispute. Five or six spectators sitting on the ground below the east command platform suddenly rushed into the stadium, intending to help fight. They were persuaded to stop. Mayor Wu personally inspected the area for a week, and the guards were transferred to maintain order, so nothing happened. The match continued, but both sides' interest in the ball was greatly reduced, and the battle was slowed down.</p>
<p>Mediocre: Pulling Back a Point. In the 25th minute, the Hong Kong team adopted a defensive stance. "Little Black Coal" led the three armies to attack bravely. Goalkeeper Bao also opened the net, and Chen Zhenhe slowly shot the ball in, pulling back the most valuable point and preventing a shutout. At this point, the Hong Kong army became more careful and retreated step by step. The "King of Football" stood by with his hands in his sleeves outside the center line. Once, he broke into Mai's formation and collided with Tan Jiangbai, both falling to the ground. The two old friends helped each other up and smiled. Not long after, the silver whistle sounded, and the battle ended. Hong Kong won the second half 1-1, and the overall score was 3-1. Hong Kong won this year's football championship.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Chen Yuqiong Breaks National Games Record in Women's 200m Breaststroke <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Also Surpasses Yang Xiuqiong's Time</p>
<p>Yesterday's women's 200m breaststroke preliminary was changed to a final due to the small number of participants. The first place was won by Chen Yuqiong from Guangdong. Chen's time was 3 minutes 38.5 seconds, breaking Yang Xiuqiong's national record of 3 minutes 41.1 seconds, and also breaking the National Games women's swimming exhibition record of 3 minutes 58 seconds. Chen is only 15 years old and achieving this is not easy. Yang Xiuqiong withdrew from the breaststroke preliminary. If Yang had participated, Chen would have faced a big threat. Chen Yuqiong is truly a formidable youngster. In yesterday's race, Chen took the lead from the start and continued straight to the finish line, winning over second place Lin Duli by three meters, second place winning over third place Qu Enzhao also by three meters, and third place winning over fourth place He Wenjin also by three meters, which is quite coincidental. The results are as follows: (1) Chen Yuqiong (Guangdong) 3 minutes 38.5 seconds (breaks National Games record), (2) Lin Duli (Guangdong), (3) Qu Enzhao (Hong Kong), (4) He Wenjin (Beijing), (5) Gao Heyi (Guangdong), (6) Xu Zhenwan (Guangxi).</p>

<p>Time: 1 minute 23.3 seconds</p>
<p>The men's 100m backstroke final was held after the 1500m freestyle yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The champion was Lin Huijun from Malaya. Lin took the lead from the start, followed by Chen Zhenxing. At 60 meters, Chen Zhenxing fell behind, and Shi Jinping and Chen Qiqian followed up. Shi's speed was quite fast, almost catching up to the champion Lin Huijun. Lin increased his speed in the last ten meters, so the others could not catch up. Lin won. Hong Kong's backstroke expert Liu Baoxi arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but because he did not participate in the backstroke preliminary the day before, Liu was not qualified to participate in yesterday's final. If Liu had participated, the national record might have been broken, because Liu is the record holder for the 100m backstroke. The results from yesterday are as follows: (1) Lin Huijun (Malaya), 1 minute 23.5 seconds, (2) Shi Jinping (Guangdong), (3) Chen Qiqian (Hong Kong), (4) Chen Zhenxing (Hong Kong), (5) Guo Zhenheng (Guangdong), (6) Su Tianmo (Guangdong).</p>

<p>The basketball teams of Nanjing and Hebei held their championship match yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. General opinion beforehand leaned towards Nanjing, boasting such Far Eastern stars as Tang Baokun and Li Zhenzhong, along with the elite of the National Physical Education Military Academy, giving them a stronger hope of winning the championship. Unexpectedly, after a fierce forty-minute battle, Nanjing's mainstay, Li Zhenzhong, was ejected from the field halfway through. The team lost its focus, and was disastrously eliminated by Hebei with a score of 37 to 45. The detailed account of the fierce battle is as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Baokun - A Roar Stuns the Audience - After the referee, Shu Hong, blew the whistle and chose positions, the intense battle between the two armies began. Both sides were cautious, and the score remained untouched for a long time. Li Zhenzhong jumped for the ball in the center circle and passed it to Baokun. Taking three steps as two, Li Shaoshu pounced like a hungry tiger. With a single arm raise, Little Tang opened the scoring. The Wang defender committed a foul while stealing the ball. Wang Youcai scored on the free throw. Subsequently, Li Zhenzhong shot through the center like a white rainbow, lightly lifting his hand to the basket. Wu Wenzhong received Baokun's excellent treatment and also scored successfully. The scoreboard read 10, with Nanjing leading at 8. Hebei urgently called a timeout. After the break, their momentum surged. Ze Baocheng, with his tall stature, made two successful shots under the basket. Wang Hongbin scored a long-range shot. Little Li committed his second foul. The Hebei team caught up, making the score 12 to 13.</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong - Heartbroken Departure from the Battlefield - As the clouds of war tightened, Little Li turned over and exceeded the score again. Unexpectedly, Li was reported for invading again. The scorekeeper stretched out his hand four times. General Li shook his head and sighed, enduring the pain of leaving the battlefield. The Hebei army seized the opportunity to enter, with Wang Ziheng reporting the first victory, tying the score at 15 each. Xu Zhaoxiong continued to perform meritorious service, leading the score all the way. With no one to block the center, they did as they pleased, going from 20 to 16 to 23 to 17. Tang Baokun's heart was ablaze. He used his skills from years past, making a long-range shot and recovering one point. The Hebei team reciprocated in kind, not yielding an inch. At the end of the first half, Hebei still led with 25 to 20.</p>
<p>Hebei Team - Wins the Championship Trophy - After Zhenzhong left the field, the Nanjing team relied entirely on Baokun alone to support the household, commanding the three armies, and continuing to fight. The Hebei army, holding the ambition to win the championship, refused to give up any ground. After the resumption of the battle, Ze Baocheng added two more points, and both Wangs also scored. They took a lead of 34 to 10. Seeing the situation becoming critical, Tang Baokun, unable to attack, switched to long-range shots. Wu Wenzhong followed suit, and the score gradually caught up. Unexpectedly, Changqing committed a foul, and the Hebei team added two points. Tang made another long-range shot, bringing the score to 41 to 36, with Nanjing only trailing by five points. Just as they were about to catch up, time ran out. After the Hebei team scored a few more points, the gong sounded, and the Hebei army defeated the strong Nanjing team and won the championship trophy.</p>
<p>The War - Unspeakable of Baimen - The main reason for the Nanjing team's failure yesterday was due to Li Zhenzhong's ejection from the field, which caused the team to lose contact. However, the team's slow marching was also one of the main reasons for the failure. While marching requires calmness, excessive calmness is also undesirable. Therefore, although the team held the determination to defend tightly, attack slowly, and resist for a long time, time was limited, and it became an eternal regret. However, Little Tang's superb technique should not be extinguished due to the team's failure. The rest were mediocre, with abnormal attitudes. The Hebei team was known for its speed and strength. The two Wang forwards had excellent coordination, often launching short-range attacks, reporting success upon arrival without hesitation. Liu Baocheng, with his natural stature, took full advantage. The two Li and Luo guards also fulfilled their duties. The forwards benefited greatly from their assistance. If the team seeks further development, it will not be difficult to become a strong Far Eastern team.</p>

Are they the heroes of the times? The details of the competition are as follows:</p>
<p>Battle Letters Sent Out - Intent to Kill Immediately Aroused - In this volleyball tournament, the confrontation between Shanghai and Guangdong has long been decided. However, in the semi-finals, Hunan rose up to become the champion, and Hong Kong returned defeated, which was slightly unexpected. However, this was determined by the fate of each person, and there was nothing to be done about it. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai and Guangdong teams took the field. The referee, Huang Wenjian, laid down the law in three chapters, agreed on the positions, and then issued the battle letter. Shanghai was not polite. Cheng Hongsheng served the ball, not treating the Guangdong team as guests from afar, and giving them a slight concession, scoring six points in a row. Guangdong's Yang Cha Fen was unwilling to submit and retaliated in kind. Thus, in an instant, a chaotic situation was formed, surpassing the record of Shanghai's Miss with a score of 11 to 8. After changing the field, each had their gains and losses, with no difference. Shanghai's Wang Qian served the ball. Guangdong was winning vigorously and was slightly careless. The situation changed immediately. Tu Qian served very well again. Huang Xingfen coordinated and tossed the ball, and the position was just right. The two wings killed the ball powerfully and succeeded unexpectedly. The score was 21 to 18, and Shanghai won the first game.</p>
<p>Cheering and Encouragement - Guangdong Makes a Draw - On the spectator side, the number of people gathered more and more, each enjoying their enjoyment, cheering endlessly, with throats difficult to be hoarse, and enthusiasm was very high. The female generals of the Shanghai and Guangdong teams had each experienced great battles, and were not moved by color, sound, goods, or profits, but each regarded themselves as strong. The Guangdong team served the ball quickly and fluently. Shanghai also had a counter-attack. Neither side suffered military wounds. The Guangdong masses had a strong sense of localism. When the high ball came, they often indicated the path outside the field, "First row," "Second row," "Third row," giving Guangdong one more consideration opportunity. From then on, they soared straight up, unexpectedly winning with a slight lead of 21 to 16, tying Shanghai to a score of one to one.</p>
<p>Without Stopping the Horses - Shanghai Wins Again - Starting the third game, the Shanghai team, under the wink of Chen, launched a large-scale campaign. Zhang Xiangping and Xingfen had to take care of the front and look after the back. The horse hooves made a clicking sound, and the feet did not stop slightly. Xian Zhuzhu stood alone at the heavy pass, like an iron barrier. Although the Guangdong team had fierce attacks from Yang Yuqiong and Yan Xiurong, they did not see any effect. In the first half, Shanghai had already scored 11 points, while the daughters of Guangzhou only had six points. The momentum was gone, and the audience was not at risk. Who knew that virtuality and reality, advancing and retreating, were originally procedures that should have been on the art of war. The Guangdong team used this move, taking advantage of the Shanghai team's victory and complacency, and they made a single effort, instead taking the lead with 19 to 9. The Shanghai ladies, at this point, regretted their initial carelessness, and immediately cheered up, fighting to the death, so that the central hinterland of Guangdong had no quiet land. After the disaster, they finally cleaned up and Shanghai scored 19, while Guangdong still had only 14. After Yang Yuqiong rose again and killed hard, she only had the upper hand at the end of the crossbow, and could not save the overall situation at all, ending the game at 19 to 21, and Shanghai won.</p>
<p>The Sun Shines on the Eyes - Shanghai's Success - In the fourth game, Guangdong was like a man who could conquer heaven and earth, and if they could win back a game, then there would be a good fight in the future, otherwise where would their fame be buried? Therefore, Bao Yiwei served the ball, and immediately gritted his teeth, preparing to force the four doors. When a ball was shot, it was loud and rewarded the heart, and sure enough, it was a resounding one, winning the first half with a score of 11 to 6. The progress was pressing, and when it was 19 to 15, the Shanghai team used continuous and rapid shooting, passing, and splitting, although they did not use much force, and already blinded the eyes and confused the hands, making the Shanghai team chase to a tie, and the soldiers came to block them, which was very dangerous. As a result, the Guangdong team's sun shot from the west, shining in the eyes, and finally became the Shanghai team's consecutive wins of two points, losing the key point with 21 to 17. The Women's Volleyball Championship was also created by the sun, offering it to Shanghai and continuing to dominate. The score was three to one.</p>
<p>General Observation of Both Sides' Skills - Looking at the two teams' balls in general, Guangdong can attack but not defend, so when they encounter a strong enemy, they will be blocked and fall into a difficult situation. Yan Xiurong and Yang Yuqiong are killing stars, but they are heroes of troubled times, not capable ministers of peaceful times, who can share hardships but cannot enjoy happiness. The three rows lack contact and cannot bear to clean up the mess, which is the biggest reason for their defeat. Shanghai's contact skills are breathtaking, but their killing balls are weak and the method is not good, so the progress is not fast. Although they have won the championship today, it seems that they still need plenty of time to train to kill the ball with force.</p>

<p>Seven innings result in 26 to 9 - The Assembly Standard Team Shakes the Beach of Shanghai</p>
<p>The Sino-Western women's softball competition between the Western Overseas Chinese and Shandong formally started at 3:30 PM yesterday at Hongkou. The Western Overseas Chinese team was organized by the British and American overseas Chinese in Shanghai, and they usually not only practice specially, but also challenge various parties to observe skills. The current Women's Softball Champion of the National Games is Shandong. The Western Overseas Chinese team specially challenged our champion, Shandong. Shandong is an army of hundreds of battles and hundreds of victories, and they are not afraid of any strong enemy, so they agreed to fight generously. After the two teams fought, it was very fierce, but the Western Overseas Chinese team's technology was poor and suffered a disastrous defeat.</p>
<p>A Home Run to Demonstrate Power - Although Shandong is the Assembly Rogue Army, they must be careful when they meet the Western Overseas Chinese. At the beginning of the battle, the Western Overseas Chinese took the attack first, and the second round was hit, both died under the hands of Shandong technicians. The third person hit desperately, the ball was in the sky, and the loop reported that he was still alive, which made the Lu team feel terrified. As a result, they scored one point in the first inning.</p>
<p>Giving Back Her Color - Shandong's counterattack was careful, and they tried the bat slightly. Unexpectedly, the first bat was hit by Zhang Muxia, and the ball crossed the middle field, unable to be found. The runner happily returned home with the stick, and then Shan Jin Zhifan took the wheel, and the first bat also followed the example of the predecessors, returning with a belly laugh in the sound of the crowd cheering. The misses of the Western Overseas Chinese were all so frightened that their faces were ashen.</p>
<p>Arm Strength is Like a Tiger - The battle continued, and the Lu side scored points in succession. The Western Overseas Chinese pitcher, in order to save the overall situation, showed great skill, and killed two people with several good throws, and the momentum slightly turned, but Lu Fu forcefully attacked two points, and the first inning ended with eight points. Subsequently, in the second, third, and seventh innings, Shandong still relied on its superior hitting skills and gained many points. The Western Overseas Chinese had no intention of resisting,</p>
<p>Fighting Against the City - The female heroes of the Western Overseas Chinese took the decision to avenge their car shame, fighting against the city. Starting from the third inning, the pitcher began to throw inward curved balls, with no one in the left, and no mistakes had been made, and Shandong Lunlei's secret attack plan was broken by the receiver.</p>
<p>The Outer Wing is Not Strong - In each inning, the technique of the outer wing of the Western Overseas Chinese bridge is poor, and high balls often fall empty, which makes Shandong more and more opportunities, and fortunately, in the seventh inning, the Western Overseas Chinese hits were prosperous, and they scored four points in a row, although they could not avenge their revenge, the overall situation was still considerable. The friendly match between the two teams ended in the dim twilight.</p>

<p>The men's tennis singles final was held yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The opponents were Xu Chengji from Java and Qiu Feihai from Shanghai. Xu is a young athlete with superb tennis skills, known throughout the country. Since the start of the battle, he has repeatedly defeated the strong with his excellent skills. Qiu is a veteran tennis player, and his skills have been deteriorating due to his old age and weak body. However, the battle yesterday was still passable. His long shots from the baseline posed a great threat to Xu, earning him a lot of applause. As a result, Xu defeated Old Qiu in three straight sets and won the championship. There was also the losers' bracket match between Lin Baohua and Qian Yaobin. Qian forfeited and was ranked fourth. Lin and Di were originally scheduled to compete for the runner-up at 9:00 AM this morning, but both of them belonged to Shanghai. It was difficult to predict the outcome of a fraternal dispute. Moreover, they were extremely exhausted after days of fighting. And from Shanghai's perspective, no matter who wins, it is always the second and third, so it is not related to the overall situation. Therefore, the two agreed to cancel the battle, and Lin forfeited, so Qiu was the runner-up and Lin was third. The final results are as follows:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first set, Xu was determined to avenge his disastrous defeat in the doubles yesterday, so he gave Old Qiu a head-on blow, wielding a big knife and ignoring everyone around him. Old Qiu was running around, making it difficult to parry, and there was no room for resistance. Xu actually won with a shutout, which was extremely tragic. In the second set, Old Qiu improved slightly. His long shots from the baseline were inserted into both corners, and his shots were powerful. Xu was also unable to cope, taking a 2-1 lead. However, it was a flash in the pan, and Jia immediately added two games, reversing the situation with 3-2. Qiu tried his best to attack, creating a 3-3 tie. However, Xu persevered and refused to relax. His sharp serve and wonderful volley made Old Qiu helpless and could only sigh at the ball. So, one game after another, he rose one level at a time, winning again with 6-3. In the last set, Xu's sharpness became even stronger, and he went down in one go, winning four games in a row. Later, because the victory was in sight, he did not demand too much, so Old Qiu took the opportunity to counterattack, winning back one game. Unexpectedly, Old Qiu took an inch and went a mile, winning another city. Xu saw that Old Qiu's old strength was flourishing, and if he did not show a little color, he would raise a tiger to be a traitor, and a spark would start a prairie fire, so he also added a game, leading the way with 5-2. Next, Qiu served, and Xu had a great chance of winning. However, he was too hasty, and several high pressures became a waste of effort. As a result, Qiu won, making it 5-3. In the ninth game, Zhada served, and Youquan could be manipulated, so he won the game with a light touch, returning in triumph with 6-3, and winning the singles championship.</p>
<p>A List of the Championship Situation</p>
<p>Although Xu Chengji from Java won the singles first place and the doubles second place in the tennis championship, according to the regulations, he is only listed as the runner-up of the team. In addition to winning the doubles championship, Shanghai also had Lin and Qiu win the singles second and third places.

Lin Baohua should be modest as the captain and give the award to Qiu Feihai to be the runner-up, and Lin himself is ranked third, so this competition has been cancelled.</p>

So, Chen was ranked fourth, and Huang will compete for the runner-up at 9:00 AM this morning. The results of Zha'an are as follows: Wang Chunjing of Western Shanxi has not met an opponent since the start of the battle. In many battles, she has won with a one-sided situation. Her hitting technique is experienced, her pumping and pressing are powerful, and she has a heroic spirit. The situation changed in the battle against Wei Maigu of Shanghai yesterday, and it took a lot of effort to defeat the enemy. Wei's hitting technique is stable, her wit is superior, and her ability to save dangerous balls is especially her strength. At the beginning of the first set, Little Wei's hitting momentum was extremely strong. Wang desperately attacked and Wei used the honeydew melon hitting technique to make things difficult for the enemy. So, the situation became tense, and the scores of both sides were not far apart. Wang took the lead with a score of 5-4, but Wei did not panic and tied the score. Then, he added another game, reversing the situation with a score of 6-5. Finally, Wang's deep diagonal shots into both corners were extremely rapid, and Wei was tired of running around and had to admit defeat, losing the first set with a score of 6-8. In the second set, Wei showed signs of exhaustion due to excessive exertion in the previous set, while Wang was full of stamina and became more and more courageous. High-pressure low-draw control cut, Wei only won two games, and Wang won again with 6-1, winning the championship.</p>

<p>The third and fourth place finals between Shanghai and Beiping were held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Beiping had unfortunately lost to Hebei, and they planned to go down in one go in the battle against Shanghai yesterday. Therefore, they launched a fierce attack in the first half. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai team, after learning a lesson in the initial battle against Shanxi, was careful every step of the way, becoming more and more courageous, and did not dare to be careless. The main time ended directly, resulting in a tie of 49 to 49. Yin Guiren used overtime to solve the problem. As a result, Beiping won two goals first, but Xu Wenkui and Yin Guiren of the Shanghai team scored one after another, winning the third place with 59 to 54.</p>
<p>Looking at the battles of the two armies in general, the ball skills have their own merits. Xu Wenkui of the Shanghai army was the most outstanding yesterday, running all over the field and scoring the most baskets. Sun Baoqing guarded the defense, with each copper wall and iron wall, the Beiping team had no way to attack, so they could not throw in, and finally lost the city in the last five minutes. If the army was able to use the method of five-man defensive connectivity, they may not have suffered a disastrous defeat,</p>
<p>When the two armies fought, Li Heding scored the first goal, and Mu Zuoyun and Zhang Liankui scored a goal each, gaining ten points in one breath. The Shanghai team was not prosperous. After a long time of battle, Feng Nianhua scored a goal. In a blink of an eye, Li Heding scored again, making it 17 to 4. This was the era of Beiping team's total victory. Since then, the situation has been going downhill. Chen Xianglong made a quick penalty with a throw, and Feng Nianhua made a light cavalry sneak attack, chasing it to 19 to 20, and the competition turned interesting and fierce. Li Zhongfeng's last throw slightly took the lead at 27 to 25 in the first half.</p>
<p>After changing places and fighting again, Xu Wenkui scored one after another, creating a tie of 49 points. The scores rose and fell, and the situation was extremely tense. Until the gong rang to end the game, the scoreboard was hung high with a tie of 49 points, so the time was extended according to law. Liu Shiming of the Ping team scored a goal with one throw, and Li Heding followed suit, adding four points one after another. The Shanghai army did not panic, Xu Wenkui scored three yuan in a row, and Yin Guiren scored one point with a penalty, making it 59 to 54. Just as the Ping team was preparing to throw the basket, the sound of the gong rang, announcing the end of the battle, and the Ping team ranked fourth.</p>

<p>Beiping Ranks Fourth</p>
<p>A women's volleyball consolation match, (1) for the third and fourth place final, was held yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, with Hunan against Beiping, (3) Hong Kong against Guangdong to be held this morning at nine o'clock. However, in previous matches, Guangdong had defeated Hunan, so even though Hunan defeated Beiping after the championship deliberation, they only took third place. The Guangdong-Hunan match may not need to be held, and the Guangdong team can secure the runner-up position. Yesterday's Hunan-Hong Kong match was also a fierce and arduous battle, as shown below:</p>
<p>Consolation Third/Fourth Place Final: Hunan, as an inland team, initially gained attention for their emphasis on strength. Although they seemed lacking in personnel, their tactics were outstanding. In terms of individual technique, the three forwards were short but skilled, with the middle row passing, setting, and saving with precision. After taking the court, they assumed the Beiping team was a dominant force in North China, strong and powerful, and difficult to beat, so they were demoralized and listless, losing the first set with a score of 5 to 21. From the beginning of the second set, they took the offensive, but they still didn't show their true grit, and Miss Fang Ji, the backbone of Beiping, remained determined not to give way easily, so the battle was indeed very fierce, but they still lost with a score of 21 to 23. In the third set, Hunan was determined to compete, so they never showed any sign of loosening up, and won it back with a score of 21 to 18. In the fourth set, Beiping's back row was unable to fulfill its duties, and there were too many self-inflicted errors, allowing Hunan to win again. From then on, the strength was evenly matched, and no one could be taken lightly. In the fifth set, Hunan's serves were straight and often cleverly landed on the back line, and Beiping often made the mistake of hitting the ball out of bounds, making repeated errors, and there was no remedy. As a result, Hunan defeated them with a score of three to one. The scores for both the fourth and fifth sets were 21 to 14.</p>

<h3 id="e196">A Suggestion for Our Country to Strive to Participate in the 11th World Games <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>- Song Ruhai</p>
<p>The World Games have been around for thirty-eight years since the French male buddy——Mr. Ge Huating painstakingly recovered them in 1896 AD. During these thirty-eight years, they have been held ten times in various European and American countries. Next year——1936 will be the 11th World Games in Berlin, Germany. The German government has been preparing for the Games for three years, and a new sports field has been built outside Berlin, such as swimming pools, gymnasiums, and football fields, all of which have been newly planned and built with extremely new and exquisite designs. In addition, an "Olympic Village" has been built specifically to accommodate athletes and guests from various countries. From this, it can be seen that the German government is extremely thorough in its preparation of venues, facilities, and hospitality for this Games. Each matter and item is assigned to a special commissioner to be responsible for the preparation. According to the report of the American committee participating in the World Games, the equipment of this World Games is more complete and thorough than any previous country. People can't help but admire the German national design and the German people's attitude towards sports in all aspects. It can be seen that they are meticulous in every aspect.</p>
<p>However, among the nations of the world today, no one can deny the strength of the German nation, which is stronger than any other nation. The reason for its strength lies in the fact that men, women, old and young, all pay attention to sports, regarding sports as life, almost as if it were innate. They not only advocate it, implement it, and organize it, but the government also established a national sports department, the highest administrative body in charge of sports, on par with other departments of the country, and assigned senior officials to be responsible for it, controlling the national sports cause. Therefore, the effect is great and fast.</p>
<p>Our country's participation in the World Games started in the 9th Games. Before that, almost no one knew of this name and knew of this event. Even those who knew were very few. At that time, Ruhai happened to be studying in America. Because he had a penchant for sports, he was sent by the National Sports Association to participate as a representative. Later, at the 10th World Games held in the United States, our country officially sent Mr. Liu Changchun to attend and participate. From then on, our country had a considerable understanding of the World Games. Therefore, at this Games, the Ministry of Education and the National Sports Committee resolved to send more athletes to participate in various sports such as football, basketball, track and field, swimming, and weightlifting. It is also a good phenomenon for our country's sports.</p>
<p>However, Ruhai has something he cannot refrain from saying. He sincerely hopes that our government will also follow Germany's approach to sports facilities and establish a sports department, the highest sports administrative body in the country, under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, on an equal footing with departments such as education and internal affairs, and appoint senior officials to preside over it, with special responsibilities, planning, managing, and controlling all sports matters, in order to promote the development of national sports, so as to be effective. Ruhai once read the article "On the Construction of a New Sports Administrative System in Our Country" by Professor Cheng Dengke of the Physical Education Department of Central University in the 12th issue of the 2nd volume of the Diligent Sports Monthly. I think that Mr. Cheng's suggestion to form a National Sports Committee under the three departments of education, training, and internal affairs still needs to be improved. A sports department should be set up directly under the Executive Yuan, equal to other departments, and handled in the same system, similar to the situation in Germany today. Isn't this better than jointly forming a National Sports Committee? At the same time, military leaders such as Shi Youdang set an example by starting from their own advocacy and implementing it themselves, such as Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy. In addition to proposing to the people, they themselves practice labor exercise on a daily basis (such as exercising that is beneficial to the body and mind, such as digging the ground and planting flowers). This is exactly the case. If our country, from top to bottom, can have such a trend, then what is urgently needed today is for the government to select and send national sports experts and those who have a keen interest in sports to visit various European and American countries that focus on sports for reference and careful observation, so as to learn from them. The revival of the nation depends on this.</p>
<h3 id="e197">President Wang Encourages the Athletes of the National Games: The Spirit of Sports and the Work of Saving the Country <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The original text of President Wang's speech at the reception for the athletes of the National Games on the 14th is recorded below. Chairman, distinguished guests, the 6th National Games have been held for several days since the opening ceremony on National Day. In these few days, whether it is what you see at the venue or what you hear in the broadcast reports, you all say in unison that, judging from the order and discipline of the event, it has improved compared to the previous Games, and judging from the sports achievements of the athletes, it has also improved compared to the previous Games. These improvements are the glory of your efforts and the joy of the people of the country who are concerned about sports. The National Games have been held only six times so far, but there has been progress every time. This not only shows your efforts, but also shows the national people's vigorous promotion of sports. The enthusiastic emotions of hundreds of thousands of spectators have been transmitted to the ears and eyes of thousands of athletes, encouraging you and giving you a lot of courage, knowing that society has infinite expectations and infinite trust in you. You are more aware of the importance of your responsibilities. Originally, sports are something that every individual, every nation, and every country should work together on, especially for us during the national crisis. We regard sports as an important work for saving the country and preserving its existence, and we must work together with even more effort. It is often said that a sound spirit resides in a sound body. For the sake of the soundness of the spirit, this is indeed the case. Even for the body itself, its soundness is also necessary, because all work must be handled with a sound spirit and shouldered with a sound body. For example, in war, there is no need to wear iron armor and hold a big knife anymore, but military actions cannot be tolerated by a weak body. Not only war is like this, but although all machines can replace manual labor, and all means of transportation can be replaced by machines, people who are not physically strong and agile are often unable to use machines and are instead burdened by machines. Therefore, in this world, every individual should not only pay attention to movement in terms of spiritual cultivation in order to maintain the vigor and soundness of the spirit, but also pay attention to movement in terms of physical training, so as to forge an iron-like body, which can be sufficient to bear all things and overcome all difficulties. From this point of view, the significance of sports lies in strengthening the race and strengthening the country, and the single-hole significance of sports during the national crisis lies in strengthening the race and strengthening the country in order to save the country and preserve its existence. The source of the national people's enthusiastic emotions for you lies in this, and the source of your regard for sports as a sacred duty and your efforts to fulfill it also lies in this. Speaking of the work of saving the country and preserving its existence, it not only has a consistent meaning with the work of sports, but also the methods and principles are consistent. To give an example, the essence of sports lies in one's own efforts. Every athlete knows that if he wants to achieve excellent results, he must work hard in practice on weekdays. In the world, there are only people who work hard at ordinary times and fail due to occasional misfortune when they enter the competition temporarily, and there are absolutely no people who do not work hard at ordinary times and win due to occasional luck when they enter the competition temporarily, because entering the competition now is not like entering the competition in the past in the Eight-legged Essay era, which can get lucky like winning the lottery. In addition to showing real skills to do real comparisons in order to obtain fair judgment, there is no other way to save the country and preserve its existence. When two countries meet, they rely entirely on their strength to judge the superior and the inferior and to determine the victory or defeat. Therefore, the number of victories or defeats is not determined during the war, but has already been determined in peacetime. In today's world of the jungle, there is no survival without strength, and no country survives without strength. If you want to avoid destruction, you can only prepare your own strength. One more point of strength prepared is one more point of guarantee for survival. Destruction and non-destruction are determined by whether or not you work hard. To give another example, the essence of sports lies in one's own efforts, and the result of effort is inevitable progress. Every athlete knows that he may not necessarily be able to win if he works hard, but he will definitely be able to make progress if he works hard, because if I work hard myself, others will also work hard themselves, so victory is not necessarily certain. Therefore, every athlete, if he wants to make progress, can only work hard to practice, and can only hope that he will make progress, and does not have to hope that others will go bad.</p>
<p>Sports is like this, and so is the work of saving the country and preserving its existence. Today, those who advocate saving the country and preserving its existence all know that they must lie on firewood and taste gall, and indeed they cannot save the country and preserve its existence without lying on firewood and tasting gall. But lying on firewood and tasting gall can only grasp the work of saving the country and preserving its existence, and there must be progress, but it cannot be said that it will definitely win, because if we lie on firewood and taste gall, others will also lie on firewood and taste gall. King Goujian of Yue lay on firewood and tasted gall, while King Fuchai of Wu embraced Sishi's absurd rumors and lived in pleasure, so King Goujian of Yue would definitely be able to win. If he lay on firewood and tasted gall like the Wu Lord Fuchai, then it cannot be said that King Goujian of Yue would definitely win. Today, the strong in the world are striving to maintain their strong position permanently, and not only that, but they are also striving to keep the weak in a weak position permanently. Then, how dare the weak say that the result of lying on firewood and tasting gall will definitely lead to victory? However, victory is not inevitable, but progress is. We can only strive to make progress every day. It is our great wish to gain victory through progress. Otherwise, we have done our best and exhausted our efforts, and we can look up to the sky without shame and down to earth without regret. This is where the sportsman can rest assured and establish his life, and it is also where the patriot can rest assured and establish his life. To give another example, there is no doubt that the result of effort will inevitably lead to progress. However, is this kind of progress already too late? Taking sports as an example, the National Games have indeed made progress every time, but this kind of progress can only be comforting to the whole country. If we compare the results of our National Games with the results of the Far Eastern Games, then we will have to be ashamed of ourselves. If we go further and compare them with the World Games, then we will be even more behind. The reason for this is that our country's promotion of sports is three or forty years later than others. In these three or four decades, others have already made progress and moved forward, so we look forward to it and hope that we can't catch up. But what can we do? Do we report that we are discouraged? Instead of being discouraged, we should make efforts in time. We only need to examine our own results and know that there is progress in each session to know that if we work hard, there will be progress. Then, our efforts are hopeful and our progress is guaranteed. As long as we work hard, we will have fulfilled our responsibilities. Sports is like this, and so is saving the country. Since the world's transportation, some countries have already become inanimate due to their weakness, and some countries have been stimulated and have made efforts in time, and have already occupied the position of the strong. Our country is not weak and small, nor is it strong. There is a special term for it: weak and big. Because it is big, it is envied by people. Because it is weak, it is slaughtered by people. Now, if we want to turn weakness into strength, and politics, economy, military, and culture are all five or sixty years behind, even if we want to make efforts in time, we have already been overwhelmed. But what can we do except make efforts in time? We dare not say that we can certainly survive if we make efforts, but we dare to say that we will certainly perish if we do not make efforts. Then, we can only make efforts in time, and only make double efforts in time. Let's not talk about the past, we can only make efforts now and make efforts in the future. There are quite a few people who often have two kinds of mentality towards everything from white sports to saving the country and preserving its existence. One is too discouraged, thinking that it is too late to make efforts now. The result of this kind of discouragement will inevitably be self-abandonment, which is absolutely unacceptable. The other is too careless. They do not observe clearly or judge clearly between themselves and others. They are complacent with what they have gained. The result is that they do not measure their strength and eventually insult and destroy themselves, which is also absolutely unacceptable. Today, the first thing we must know is that the national crisis is imminent, and we cannot allow ourselves to slack off even for a moment. The second thing we must know is that things are done by people. We only ask whether we do it or not, and we do not have to ask whether we succeed or not. We must be determined, and we must be persistent in our work. We must make efforts at all times, and we must seek progress at all times. We should view all sports work in this way, and we should also view all work of saving the country in this way. Tonight, I have prepared some small groups to invite you to wish you success in your efforts, progress in your progress, and good health in your bodies. May individuals be strong, groups be strong, and the country and nation be strong. Long live the 6th National Games! Long live the Republic of China!</p>

<h3 id="e201">Investigation of Participation Expenses of Each Unit <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The participation expenses of each province and city in the Games vary due to different situations in each place. Our newspaper reporter specifically investigated each unit.

<h3 id="e202">Anecdotal Notes from the Venue <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's football and basketball championships have already been lost, so when the third and fourth places were decided yesterday, Li Yichen and Lin Jing from the football team and Lu Zhongen from the basketball team were demoralized and unwilling to play. From the perspective of sportsmanship, it was a bit too much.</p>
<p>When Beijing and Hebei competed for the men's basketball championship, both sides had cheerleader teams, and they were fighting fiercely. The Hebei team said, "Hebei is good, Hebei is good, Hebei basketball is great." The Nanjing team said, "It's nothing, it's nothing." In the past few days, the ball games have been a continuous good show, and the Shanghai fans have had a great time. However, the basketball and football games clashed in time, and there was a sigh that they could not see the whole picture. Those who were more sophisticated watched half of each game.</p>
<p>The wind has not been good these days. Referees were beaten on the volleyball court, and spectators also fought each other on the football field. Yesterday, another beating occurred on the football field. Referees are really having a hard time this year.</p>
<p>The Games will close today, and the athletes from each unit will be returning home. Everyone is packing up in the dormitories, and the scene is very sad.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the crowds watching the football match yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Odds and Ends <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Paper Hats Are All the Rage at the Venue</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was still incredibly hot. Modern girls all used umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun. Men who didn't bring hats would fold newspapers into hats to reduce the sun's intensity. Therefore, self-made paper hats were very popular at the venue, almost ubiquitous.</p>
<p>A Last-Place Finisher Takes It Easy</p>
<p>During yesterday's 1500-meter freestyle race, two athletes in the sixth and ninth lanes seemed to lack some strength. At the 1000-meter mark, they were about 100 meters behind the leader. But these two last-place finishers were in good spirits, continued forward, and often smiled at each other. This was a leisurely swim.</p>
<p>Ningbo Old Woman Says "Truly Hard"</p>
<p>The swimming pool is only 50 meters long, so athletes participating in the 1500-meter race must go back and forth 30 times, which is indeed very difficult. Behind the press box, an old woman from Ningbo said, "It's hard, hard, truly hard. Watching thirty laps, my eyes can't take it."</p>
<p>Girls Waiting in the Sun, How Miserable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the girls held up umbrellas to watch the competition, completely blocking the view of the spectators behind them. Therefore, everyone shouted in unison, "We can't see! Please don't hold up your umbrellas!" The girls had to put away their umbrellas and wait in the sun, how miserable.</p>
<p>Starting Gun Scares Spectators</p>
<p>During the 500-meter race, the starter fired a gun to notify the athletes in the last 50 meters, which scared a spectator in the stands. He said, "Why is the starter aiming at him like that? Bullets are not toys, don't let him get hit."</p>
<p>The King of Football Shows His Power, Fans Cheer</p>
<p>When the Guangdong team's right inside forward fouled, the referee decided to award a free kick. Hong Kong's Li Huitang successfully kicked the ball in from 40 yards away. Li, the king of football, is truly extraordinary. When the ball went into the net, fans cheered, the sound wave was huge. One spectator said, "This really has the majesty of a football emperor."</p>
<p>Sun Da-mao Is Also Proficient in Basketball</p>
<p>Da-mao, is a famous track and field athlete, but he is also very proficient in basketball, so yesterday he sat quietly in the center of the north stand of the basketball hall to watch the game until after the game, when he strolled towards the track and field.</p>
<p>Hebei Cheerleaders Are Colorful</p>
<p>Yesterday was the final match between Nanjing and Hebei men's basketball. Each team had cheerleaders cheering them on, their every move was hilarious. It is said that the Hebei cheerleading team has undergone considerable training. It would have been even more exciting if the main character had come.</p>
<p>Reporter Drives Away the Monks</p>
<p>Yesterday, because of the Hong Kong-Guangdong football final, the number of spectators in the track and field was a new record since the opening. Thousands of students from other provinces also sat on the grass in the field. The press box was also occupied by the audience. When the reporters entered the field at 2 o'clock, there were no seats for them. It was truly a case of the kitchen staff driving away the monks.</p>
<p>Copper Coins Are Bought With Money</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the Hong Kong-Guangdong football final, a group of fans were so engrossed that they lost their minds. When they saw something exciting, they threw copper coins in their hands regardless. Several spectators were hit and bled. The venue announcer, upon learning of this, immediately reported, "Your copper coins are bought with money, please don't throw them around."</p>
<h3 id="e204">Students Still Visited in Large Numbers Yesterday <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still four to five thousand students visiting, such as from Chi Chih University, Zhi Ren Yong Girls' High School, etc. More than 200 students from Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College, led by Tang Zhao-yu. Students from Beijing and Provincial Yang Middle School left Shanghai last night.</p>
<h3 id="e205">City Party Headquarters Hosted a Banquet Last Night for Athletes From Remote Provinces <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>This National Games is being held in Shanghai, gathering athletes from all over the country in one place, and the atmosphere is enthusiastic, which is unprecedented. Athletes from remote provinces such as Xinjiang, Suiyuan, Rehe, and Liaoning have also come to Shanghai to participate. At this time when the country is changing, it is especially inspiring. The City Party Headquarters specially hosted a banquet for athletes from remote provinces at Chunhua Restaurant in the city center at 7 o'clock last night. Dozens of people including Wu Xing-ya, Tong Xing-bai, Wu Kai-xian, Lu Jing-shi, and athletes attended. During the banquet, the chairman gave a welcome speech and gave encouragement. The guests and hosts did not disperse until about 9 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Sichuan Athletes Soliciting Exhibits <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>To Hold a Sports Exhibition in Sichuan</p>
<p>A letter from the Sichuan delegation to all circles to solicit exhibits: Sirs, We humbly believe that Sichuan, located in the western frontier, with inconvenient transportation, slow cultural development, and backward in sports, has not been valued by the general public. However, under the current international political situation and the revitalization of the nation, it occupies an important position and has been recognized by people at home and abroad. The construction of new Sichuan has already begun, and there has been progress in all aspects. However, due to our own limited capabilities, we hope that celebrities and patriots from all walks of life will provide direct and indirect support, so that the construction of new Sichuan can be completed as soon as possible. This is the sincere hope of our team members. The academic skills of our team members are very immature. This time, we were ordered to represent Sichuan at the National Games in Shanghai, regardless of the gains or losses of medals, the superiority or inferiority of results, the purpose is to show national unity, sincere solidarity, pay attention to observation, and learn from each other's strengths. Therefore, our team is now planning to collect as much as possible the sports achievements and sports equipment of various provinces and cities in the country, so that when we return to Sichuan, we can hold an unprecedentedly grand exhibition in the Chengdu-Chongqing area, and evolve the exhibition into a "Sports Library", so that the people of all circles in Sichuan can have the opportunity to observe and study, as if they were visiting various provinces and cities in person, and attending sports venues in person, which will benefit the people of the country.

<p>Guangdong's young female swimmer, Ms. Hu Yueying, is expected by all parties to win a medal this time due to her amazing performances. Unexpectedly, Ms. Hu fell and injured her right foot while walking with her peers on the 16th. She could not walk immediately. Later, her father took her to see a doctor for emergency treatment, and she was able to walk on the 18th, but there was still a slight pain. The brave Ms. Hu still did not want to miss this opportunity and disappoint everyone, and insisted on attending the swimming competition. Her uncle, Zhao Bin, and others tried to dissuade her to no avail, and she still wanted to attend the meeting. Later, the team leader Zhang Zongcheng prevented her from attending the performance because she was young and her foot injury had not healed, and it would be dangerous if she exerted herself. Ms. Hu listened and gave up her right, and was disappointed. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she said that she was ashamed to see the elders of Guangdong. After many people comforted her, she was still unhappy and very frustrated.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Team Leaders and Athletes Talk About the Sports Situation in Border Provinces <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Xikang According to the reporter's interview with the team leader of Xikang, Ma, the most common sports among the people in Xikang include horse racing, string dancing, bullfighting, and shamanistic rituals. After 1929, Long Shou-xian, the former member of the Xikang Political Affairs Committee, promoted new sports such as track and field and ball games. It has not been promoted for ten years, so there is no achievement to speak of. This is the first time to participate in the National Games. There are a total of eleven athletes. The participating events are all track and field. The strength is of course weak, but the purpose of this trip is not to win medals, but to take this opportunity to observe and learn, as a foundation for promotion.</p>
<p>Mongolia The reporter also met eight Mongolian wrestlers in the martial arts field. They were all burly men. They all wore red-topped melon skin satin hats, leather vests with copper nails, big red silk pants, black leather fast boots, and five-color green ribbons around their necks. The strangeness of the costumes was unprecedented for us. According to Enhe Amur, the team leader of the Mongolian delegation, the wrestlers were newly arrived from Mongolia to perform. They all do not speak Chinese. They usually live as nomads, so their physique is very strong. They are brave and good at fighting, but they are very loyal and honest in dealing with people.</p>
<p>Qinghai According to the Qinghai basketball athletes, Qinghai held a provincial sports meeting once in 1920, but at that time there were only track and field competitions, and the results were not very good. After 1926, there were ball games, but they were limited to schools. In recent years, they have worked hard to promote it, and the public has gradually become interested in basketball. In the past, the most popular sports among the people were mountain climbing and horse racing, especially horse racing, which was held several times a month, and there was a scene of everyone leaving their homes.</p>
<p>Tibet Huang Cishu, the team leader of Tibet, told reporters that our province is located in the northwest and has a low culture. Most of the athletes participating this time are from Tibetan schools. The purpose is only to observe and let the people of the country recognize the flag of Tibet and pay attention to it. The sports in our province are very immature and we will work hard to promote them in the future to make them popular.</p>
<p>Suiyuan The reporter also visited Yuan Chenying, the manager of Suiyuan. According to him, the Suiyuan government has spared no effort to promote sports in recent years. The capital of Suiyuan Province, Guihua, has recently built a large-scale public sports field for the public to practice. Track and field and ball games are also gradually becoming popular among the people. There are a total of 15 athletes participating this time. Except for two people participating in martial arts competitions, the rest are all track and field.</p>
<p>Xinjiang The reporter also met Ying Bicheng, the team leader of the province, in the men's athletes' dormitory. According to him, the people of Xinjiang Province have not yet been enlightened. New sports such as track and field and ball games have not been promoted for more than ten years, so they can only be promoted in schools, and the public has not yet been popularized. The existing sports among the people include swimming, horse riding, throwing stones, and fighting, etc. The techniques are quite exquisite and can show the people's martial spirit everywhere.</p>

The exhibition's achievements, the richness of the works, and the wonderful content are unprecedented in Shanghai, which cannot but make people admire and love it. For example, Luo Qingzhen's "Sailing Against the Current", "Herding Home", and "Night Crossing" are all meticulously crafted. Li Hua's "Angry Horse", "Go to the City", and "Mutiny" are all masterpieces of craftsmanship, surpassing even the gods. And Ye Fu's "Big Belly Salt", "Funeral", "Sadness" and other works and Lan Jia's "Rickshaw Puller" and "The Same Faces" all powerfully depict the dark corners of the current society and the dynamics of the times. In this period of international disputes and world transformation, artists can break out of the ivory tower and shout for the public. There are also two brick carvings invented by Ye Fu, which are the most exciting in the entire venue, and the preciousness of ancient woodcuts, representing the brilliance of Eastern classical art, are all rare exhibits. The folk art "Year End" has hundreds of works, collecting products from the north and south, representing the customs and popular interests of various places, which should also be noted by modern people who are shouting for mass language and mass art. The remaining famous works from Germany, Italy, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries, as well as domestic masterpieces, collected a total of more than 1,000 pieces, all of which are rare treasures in the world. Today is the last day of the exhibition in Shanghai. In this rare opportunity, I hope people in Shanghai will visit.</p>

<p>The floor situation has turned slightly more relaxed; the result is a pullback of 5.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold market has seen strong buying interest for several days, with prices trending upwards and difficult to reverse. Many large players have been gradually taking profits; their numbers are not small, and the market situation is gradually loosening. Yesterday, the market reacted and turned downwards. Rumors circulated that a certain bank released a large batch of shillings. The exchange rate hardened, briefly retreating from above 50 yuan to below 40 yuan. Large players still maintained the price, and the final result was flat. This morning, overseas silver markets saw the British pound shrink and the US dollar remain stable. Floor traders claimed that the market would harden with the US dollar after closing. US purchases of near-term contracts saw speculators adding 0.0625 to the listed price. The price of far-term silver in Mouterij showed minimal fluctuations. The London gold price fell by 1.5 pence. Exchange rates uniformly contracted, and market sentiment was tired. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened at 47.8 yuan. Fuxingyong, Tiande, Dacheng, Dada, and Huixiang sold forward contracts, lowering the price to 44-45 yuan.

Many large players took advantage of the high prices to sell. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu came to sell shillings, stimulating bearish sentiment and causing prices to fall. However, prices rose again after the initial drop. Unfortunately, HSBC, the Bank of Japan, and Mitsui repeatedly sold, causing the exchange rate to loosen. The Central Bank also intervened by selling. Sellers became eager and prices gradually decreased. Rumors circulated that a certain Chinese bank released 200,000 pounds worth of forward contracts, causing market sentiment to weaken and prices to break through the 40 yuan barrier. However, large players took advantage of the low prices to prop up the market, and banks bought in at bargain prices. Prices were soon pulled up again, and many long positions were closed. It is predicted that the Indian silver price will rise by one anna, and that the 40 yuan barrier will be broken in the future. Those maintaining the price at low levels remained eager.

<h3 id="e220">Today is the Second Installment Period of the Tenth Settlement <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Today (the 20th) is the second installment period for long-term settlements. Banks (referring only to Chinese banks; foreign banks only have mortgage transactions and no long-term transactions, so they are not included) are owed over 4.5 million in overdue loans. The long-term deposits of various depositors total about 2.45 million. According to some colleagues, depositors with older accounts are afraid to trust the current bank rumors, and many want to withdraw their deposits and deposit them elsewhere. Therefore, over 1.7-8 million was withdrawn today, and only 6-700,000 was transferred. Regarding long-term overdue loans, everyone is unanimously requesting forced transfers, and only one or two out of ten are willing to repay or reluctantly repay half. Only over 500,000 in long-term overdue loans were repaid, including a portion redeemed with credit instruments. The remaining large sum of approximately 4 million was completely transferred. However, creditors had no choice but to go with the flow. Interest rates ranged from 8.75 yuan to 10.05 yuan, totaling 7-8 types of rates. Money houses have 7.3 million in overdue loans due, and they all strongly desire transfers. The exact amount of depositors' long-term deposits is unknown, approximately a large number of several hundred thousand. Although there are some withdrawals for deposit elsewhere, most are transferred as is. In addition, Shanghai banks have created over 200,000 in new long-term accounts, purely absorbed by foreign firms, Jianbang, sugar firms, and northern goods firms. The interest rate is 9.25 yuan, with a minimum of 8.75 yuan and 9 yuan. Over 2 million in overdue loans are also due. They want to collect, but the debtors absolutely refuse to pay, citing that the general market situation prevents them from repaying. Therefore, transfers are inevitable. We will see how it turns out today and report further.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Securities The Bond Market is Uncertain <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>There are only five trading days left in this month.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's market appeared relatively stable. Newspaper news was slightly dull, and rumors were unbearable to hear. The financial sector still had propping up and speculative transactions were gradually decreasing, with changes brewing for later. The 48th house was rumored to have largely sold off, and the 16th house had a large number of short positions preparing for delivery. With only five trading days left this month, there will surely be a drastic change. Yesterday's trend was slightly uncertain. The opening saw a sharp drop of half a yuan, a rather alarming situation. However, the financial sector still had the power to prop up the market, and the decline gradually stabilized. After the salt tax started, the 48th and 78th houses' buying interest did not diminish, so the market gradually became firmer, stronger towards the end. Positive 6 rose sharply by half a yuan. The second session saw the situation change. Except for one 9 Shan which was slightly weak, the rest all rose. Conscription and the 23rd checkpoint both improved by half a yuan. The afternoon opening saw this month's conscription continue to rise by half a yuan, while far-term contracts were weak and showed no signs of recovery. After that, the market turned weak again, and Positive 6 fell back by 0.4 yuan. The closing was generally weak, with conscription falling sharply by 0.55 yuan, and the rest falling by a small amount of 0.2-0.3 yuan. The daily rise and fall were greatest for conscription and Positive 6. In terms of selling, the 14th, 15th, 16th, 21st, and 26th houses sold more, while the 34th, 48th, 54th, and 78th houses bought more. As a result, the former fell by 0.1-0.45 yuan, and the latter, starting with the salt tax, rose by 0.1-0.45 yuan. The total transaction volume was 11,036,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e222">Yarn and Cotton Flower The Gold Price Reacts, The Yarn Market Feels Weaker <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned weaker, but the situation is still fluctuating. The spot yarn sales market is sluggish, and purchases from all parties are relatively slow, leading to inertia. At the same time, the gold price has reacted and fallen, making the market atmosphere even more gloomy. However, the number of transactions in the market is scarce, and most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>The Posted Yarn Price Rises and then Softens The morning opening price for posted yarn for each month was still stable, slightly higher by a few jiao. After the second round of auctions, the price gradually declined. The opening gold price reacted and declined, causing the atmosphere to relax. When the market closed, Run Kang and Changfeng came to cover short positions again, slightly rising. As a result, each month's closing price fell by 0.2-0.3 jiao compared to the previous day, except for the March contract, which rose by 0.2 jiao. In the afternoon, the opening price saw a sudden drop, saying that although Wu was preparing to receive goods this month, it was rumored that his factory had 1,000 bales of 10-count yarn with nothing to deliver, and there were also rumors that the situation was not good, and Weifeng and Hexing were selling, so the market price gradually declined. Osaka's Three Products yarn rose and fell by 0.2-0.3 jiao. As a result, each month's price fell by an average of 0.5-0.6-0.7-0.8 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Investigation of sales shows that Dafu sold 1,350 bales, Yuda sold 350 bales, Hexing sold 1,800 bales, Fengxing sold 2,350 bales, Feng sold 1,300 bales, Shenji sold 500 bales, Taichang sold 1,350 bales, Renfeng sold 55 bales, and Changgu sold 1,500 bales.

<p>The cotton market is slightly weak, but new sellers are still rare. As the delivery period for this month approaches, the short positions are cautious, so transactions in the market are scarce. The amount of goods approved by the cotton inspection office has exceeded 10,000 dan. Xinchengchang alone has a storage account of 16,300 twist.</p>
<p>Feng Flower Market Atmosphere is Relaxed The morning opening of the cotton flower market was still stable, and the US cotton rose by 0.10 to 0.06 pound sounds, and the Indian cotton rose and fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees. The market sentiment was calm, but in the second and third sessions, the news of the gold price turning downwards caused the market atmosphere to relax. However, new buyers were not enthusiastic. As a result, the current month fell by the month, and the far month rose and fell by 0.05. The afternoon opening suddenly fell, and the decline intensified due to the slump in the yarn market and the rumors. By the third closing session, it rebounded again. As a result, the current month did not move, and the far month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. Investigation of sales shows that Dafu sold 2,700 dan, Yu sold 1,800 dan, Yuda sold 1,200 dan, Hexing sold 2,900 dan, Shenchang sold 1,600 dan, Dafu sold 1,200, Shengyuan sold 1,800 dan, Tonghe sold 1,000 dan, and Shenji sold 1,900 dan.

<h3 id="e224">Section Six: Legal Issues <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The issue of women obtaining equal rights with men in public and private law is also the central issue of the women's movement. For example, women demanding legislative and political rights, property management rights, inheritance rights, marriage and divorce rights, the right for illegitimate children to have paternity acknowledged, and the equal application of laws, etc., have always been the main tenets of the women's movement.</p>
<p>If we want to correctly understand this issue, it is necessary to first understand the nature of law.</p>
<p>Many people believe that law is something that maintains social justice and fairness, but this is only a superficial observation. In reality, law is a tool for a minority to suppress the majority. Bebel has very correctly pointed this out!</p>
<p>The subordinate status between races, classes, and genders must be expressed in the country's laws and politics. A country's laws are a favorable organizational expression for the ruling class. Because women are the oppressed and obedient "sex," their legal status is also such." (Woman and Society)</p>
<p>Looking at history, the laws of the Greek and Roman eras were tools for aristocrats and free people to oppress slaves. The laws of the feudal era were shackles for a few lords and monks to oppress the majority of serfs. Even though laws in capitalist societies have absorbed some so-called democratic spirit, they still become iron whips for a few property owners to control the majority of the propertyless!</p>
<p>Law also reveals its unreasonable original form very clearly on the issue of men and women's social rights! In the traditional male-centered society, the law completely stands on the side of men, calling it "reason" and making women obey it! In other words, law has become a talisman for men to restrain women! Especially in feudal society, women were simply objects. Not only did the law not protect women's rights, but it also made the rights of men to oppress women sacred and absolute! The so-called three obediences and four virtues, and the seven grounds for divorce, although not exactly criminal laws and decrees, are used to deprive women of their rights and make men's rights sacred as absolute moral laws. However, law is not a fixed and unchanging thing; it evolves along with the evolution of society! In detail, if the economic foundation of society changes, then the political and legal superstructure also changes accordingly. In capitalist society, the laws reflecting liberal and democratic ideas are naturally different from the laws of feudal absolutist rule. Acknowledging the rights of women as "individuals" is the fundamental motivation for women demanding equal legal rights with men!</p>
<p>The male-dominated society's recognition of women's "human" rights is by no means accidental, but has a practical social basis. The most important of these is that since the era of factories and handicrafts, women have been able to participate in social production labor like men, fulfilling a major task in the national economy. The women's rights advocacy movement that flourished during the French Revolution also started from the above social basis!</p>
<p>The legal struggle of the women's rights movement was actively implemented in European and American countries from the mid to late 19th century. Especially in the UK and the US, the struggle for women to obtain legislative and political rights became a serious women's riot! As a result, male-dominated society finally recognized the principle of equality between men and women in law! But this is only a recognition of the principle! In reality, the women who can enjoy the legal rights recognized by law are limited to a very small number of upper-class women. As for the majority of working women, they still cannot enjoy any legal grace! They still have to create profits for capitalists under the so-called "free" labor contract! Inheritance rights, political rights, etc., have nothing to do with them!</p>
<p>After the European War, almost all countries in the world that entered the stage of civilization completely recognized women's legal rights. Even in the most backward China, the Kuomintang party platform stipulated various rights for women. As a result, many feminists believed that women could obtain equal legal rights under the capitalist social system, and they believed this was a manifestation of their victory! But in our opinion, this is precisely a manifestation of their illusion. If law is a reflection of economic power, then in a society where economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few men, law can only become the exclusive property of a few men, or a tool for them to use at will! The victory that feminists have won is by no means a victory for the majority of women, but only a victory for a few upper-class women!</p>
<p>Now that the capitalist world is gradually entering the fascist stage, the issue of women's equality in law has suffered a serious blow! Before Hitler came to power in Germany, there were forty-nine female delegates, but after Hitler came to power, he sent them all back to their families. Now it is a purely male parliament! The same is true in Italy, where women are not allowed to participate in political and legal institutions. This tendency is currently flourishing in various capitalist countries. Not only are women's legislative and political rights undergoing fundamental changes, but even women's occupational and labor rights are in danger of being deprived! The women's rights advocates who have been fighting for a century will inevitably feel a sense of "previous efforts being abandoned"!</p>
<p>Finally, we can draw a conclusion: the so-called law is a reflection of the economic foundation of society. In a capitalist society where economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few men, the so-called equal laws for men and women will not exist! Only in a society where there is no economic subordination between people and between men and women can law become an equal and rational contract between people, and can the principle of equality between men and women in law be thoroughly realized!</p>

<h3 id="e225">From "Save the Middle School Students" to National Salvation Education <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xin</p>
<p>Because Ms. Chen Hengzhe investigated the opinions of elementary school children's parents on current school education in the "Independent Review," and at the same time discovered that middle school students have no way to cope with their heavy workload day and night, Ms. Chen lamented the loss of life of the nation's future masters and issued a call to "Save the Middle School Students." The words came from the heart, making it even more shocking. What I admire is the slogan put forward by Ms. Chen: "Save the Middle School Students," but I want to save middle school students for other reasons, because I think what Ms. Chen sees is only one side of the current middle school education, not the whole picture.</p>
<p>We admit that education is life, education is growth, education cannot educate students to go astray, and even more cannot educate students to become dead people, so trying to help seedlings grow by pulling them up is the view of fools. In the principles of education, the psychological development and the physiological development should be consistent, which has almost become an iron rule. If one is ignorant of this point, or promotes premature development of students, or hinders their physiological health, it can be said to be extremely sinful. But if we investigate the actual situation of middle school education in our country now, whether in terms of curriculum, teaching materials, teaching methods, or life, has it all reached above a reasonable level? This becomes a very big question.</p>
<p>The new curriculum standards were formulated by educational experts hired by the Ministry of Education and ordered to be implemented. Although the government is determined to strive for rationality, the standards set may not fully meet the actual needs and there is no waste, and the quantity may not exactly match the students' ability to bear, and there is no excess or deficiency. As for teaching materials, although there are curriculum standards to follow, most of the textbooks are printed by private workshops. The subjectivity of one person or a few people cannot be avoided. The quantity, content, and time coordination often become their own theories. If we talk about teaching methods, because they directly affect students' interest in learning, the difference in teaching efficiency may not necessarily stop at one out of a hundred. Furthermore, the relationship between students' daily life and learning cannot be ignored: with a good learning environment, it is easier to achieve learning results; with a disciplined and happy life, learning can proceed in a regular manner. In these aspects, middle school students are indeed being used as passive test subjects: they cannot know for themselves how to discard impractical courses, they cannot choose for themselves how to cut down uneconomical teaching materials, and they do not even know how to replace teachers who do not have good teaching methods. What is most heartbreaking is that in Shanghai, the center of culture, middle schools are densely packed, but it can be asserted that there are almost no schools with complete facilities that provide a good learning environment for students. Students are all infected with a frivolous and impractical atmosphere, arrogant and romantic. Since it is impossible to sit still, let alone cope with heavy work! Although this is only one corner of current education, it is precisely because there is this corner that Ms. Chen Hengzhe's appeal should not only be to "Save the Middle School Students" by relieving the heavy workload, but also to issue a cry for help for the middle school students who are sinking into unreasonable suffering!</p>
<p>Today's middle school students are the lifeline of the future nation and the backbone of future national construction. Naturally, we need the lifeline of the future nation or the backbone of future national construction to be strong and robust, and the body can withstand hardships. However, at the same time, we also need the lifeline of the future nation or the backbone of national construction to be intelligent and capable, and their wisdom is sufficient to cope with the great difficulties of the future. Therefore, I still think that the education that most middle school students receive is not enough in degree and not strict enough!</p>
<p>No country's secondary education has ever been as scattered and low as ours, and no country's middle school students' lives have ever been as unrestrained as ours. We do not necessarily have to imitate the strict military national education of others, but at least in this era when the country is in danger of destruction at any moment, everyone needs to be able to shoulder the burden of national salvation and survival, and a serious national salvation education needs to be implemented!</p>
<p>Save the Middle School Students! Like Ms. Chen Hengzhe, I am also appealing for the hundreds of thousands of middle school students sinking in the sea of suffering across the country.</p>

<h3 id="e226">The North and South Poles <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Kun</p>
<p>If you go to an old villager and say, "There are two places in the world where half the year is day and half the year is night," then you will definitely be greatly ridiculed. However, in reality, there are indeed such two places in the world, namely the North and South Poles; because of the relationship between the Earth and the Sun, the South Pole is night for the first half of the year and day for the second half of the year, while the North Pole is day for the first half of the year and night for the second half of the year. At the same time, most of the South Pole is a landmass; called the world's smallest "sixth continent," surrounded by oceans, while most of the North Pole is occupied by the smallest ocean—the Arctic Ocean—surrounded by land: this is the main difference between the North and South Poles. However, these two polar regions also have many points in common. What is generally known is that the climate of both the North and South Poles is very cold. In winter, the temperature in these two polar regions is often tens of degrees below freezing. All liquids, even alcohol, have frozen into hard blocks. Temperatures above freezing can only be enjoyed for a very short time of the year here. However, believe it or not, the coldest place in the world is not the North and South Poles, but southeastern Siberia, where the climate is more than ninety degrees below zero Fahrenheit, which is truly terrifying!</p>
<p>In the eyes of people who are already well-fed and clothed, although the North and South Poles are very cold, the scenery is very beautiful. Here are snow-white icebergs, crystal-clear ice pillars, and gray-white wildernesses, reflecting in our eyes a silver world. In the coastal areas of Antarctica, when the sun is covered by thin clouds in the south and the world is as quiet as a dream, you can see icebergs and ice dikes emerging from the gray-black sea surface to the north: some are with cold purple-white colors, and some are illuminated by the sun, like golden walls. When the strong wind is blowing, the air and the water surface make a loud noise, as if a group of leopards are constantly roaring, making people feel extremely nervous and feeling the greatness of nature? Draw the North Pole, of course, you can also see the sun, but the sun seen here is at the horizon. The situation in the South Pole is the opposite. Therefore, the scenery presented by these two polar regions is also somewhat different. However, the poetic natural beauty of the two poles is the same. If you have time to visit the North and South Poles, then you will feel that the natural beauty of snow, snow, and sea waves... that many poets have sung is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Most of the people living in the polar regions are Eskimos and a small number of Samoans. They live in igloos and make a living by fishing and hunting. They are still a barbaric people. Although some Europeans and Americans have come here in modern times to explore and fish, they are by no means the main residents of the polar regions. As for how human life in these two polar regions will be in the future, it will be judged by the continued efforts of mankind to fight against nature.</p>
<p>Antarctic exploration is a great feat of mankind in the past fifty years, but the history of Arctic exploration is quite old. As early as 345 BC, the sailor Pytheas of Massalia sailed to the "North Sea," telling the story of the long nights and the state of the swimming world here. Later in history, there were some explorations of the Arctic, but the true discovery of the value of the Arctic was after Columbus discovered the New World. Because of the development of capitalism, the shipping industry needed to find a northern sea route from Europe to eastern Asia, so the Arctic region was discovered. Initially, the Arctic passage was discovered in the 16th century, and then whaling ships gradually came and went, so the various places within the Arctic Circle were gradually known to people. In the 19th century, Ross discovered the North Magnetic Pole in northern North America, Franklin discovered the Northwest Passage from northern North America to eastern Asia, and Lansian crossed the Arctic Ocean and reached a point at 86 degrees 13 minutes and 36 seconds north latitude. The Italian Kakkuni also reached 86 degrees 24 minutes north latitude. All these discoveries not only made mankind more aware of the Arctic region, but also greatly helped the development of science. By the 20th century, the Arctic region aroused even more interest from mankind, and explorers became more advanced, so many places in the Arctic became more known. Recently, the Soviet Union has used great efforts to continuously explore the Arctic, so as to conquer nature with its great new power. As for Antarctic exploration, it was prevalent in the 19th century, and the British, Americans, and Swedes have made important discoveries. In 1929, the United States organized an expedition led by Byrd, landed from the Ross Sea to Whale Bay to reach Antarctica, and established the Little America colony here; and on the Ross Ice Shelf, created new Antarctic houses, radio stations and airfields. In the future, with the continuous efforts of mankind, the value of the North and South Poles will surely be greater.</p>
<p>The North and South Poles are not only significant in terms of human transportation, but also have abundant products. In Antarctica, the output of moss, seals, seabirds, diamonds, and coal is very abundant, and the place called Whale Bay is truly worthy of its name. There are many whales in the offshore area, and the output of seagulls and seabirds is also extremely abundant. Therefore, many Europeans and even Japanese people go to catch whales by whaling ships, and many of them have made a fortune. As for the Arctic region, it produces trees, moss, wild animals, wild birds, seals, whales, and coal, which are also attracting attention. However, these are only the current discoveries. As for what is hidden under the two thousand feet of ice, and what animals are buried under the land, there is no way to know now. Therefore, these two "strange places," places where half the year is day and half the year is night, and places that are frozen for a long time, are attracting much attention from countries around the world; here, as elsewhere, the struggle between the powers is very fierce.</p>
<p>At a time when the powers are working hard to prepare for a war to re-divide the world's colonies, some people hope that everyone will work hard to develop the North and South Poles and move the surplus population of various countries to the polar regions: although this method cannot avoid war, the effort of mankind to reduce the mutual struggle between mankind and concentrate the power of all mankind to conquer nature is a great leap in the evolution of mankind. Now, there are still many treasures in the world, not just a part of the North and South Poles? If the power of all mankind is concentrated to develop it, it can make everyone's life happy. The reason why it is not so old now is because mankind is still fighting each other, making it impossible for everyone to concentrate their efforts to deal with nature. Therefore, when we talk about the North and South Poles, we hope that everyone will work hard to turn the struggle between people into the struggle of all mankind against nature.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Sichuan Province Wholesale Piece Goods and Sundries Trade <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— You Song</p>
<p>The "imported goods" of "piece goods and sundries" sold in various cities of Sichuan Province can be said to be entirely wholesaled from Shanghai. Larger commercial firms with more capital generally send a shrewd, capable, and steady partner to represent them in Shanghai to purchase goods. Smaller shops, due to economic constraints, either entrust others to act as their agent or purchase goods wholesale from larger firms. The representatives stationed in Shanghai are known in the commercial field as "Zhuang Ke" (resident buyers). They mostly reside in inns located in convenient transportation areas near commercial districts, to facilitate "receiving goods" and "shipping goods" (such as the "Yi Ji Inn" near Dai Gou Bridge and the "Hui Ji" on Wu Ma Road, are the resident locations of the Sichuanese piece goods and sundries traders). Their method of purchasing goods, except for a few cases that require direct negotiation with manufacturers or companies, is mainly through the solicitations of "Ju Ke" ("wholesale salesmen" from various manufacturers or companies). After the goods are transported to the inn and checked, the "Zhuang Ke" find people to pack them into parcels (commonly called "Da Bao"), which are then handed over to the post office or merchant ships for transportation back to Sichuan to be sold by their firms. The purchase and transportation involve many procedures and incur a lot of costs. Therefore, "piece goods and sundries from Shanghai" (and other goods as well) are at least one-third more expensive when they reach Sichuan, and sometimes almost twice as expensive.</p>
<p>However, even with rising prices, many "piece goods and sundries firms" still do not make much profit, and many even lose money and are forced to close down! What is the reason for this? It is said that half of the reason is due to the constant warfare among Sichuan warlords, with cities devastated by cannon and machine gun fire, and heavy taxes further bankrupting the rural areas. Most people have lost their purchasing power, which has obstructed the sale of goods! At the same time, because exchange rates and transportation costs are too high, the cost of purchasing goods for various firms is too high, so even raising market prices is of no use.</p>
<p>1.  High Exchange Rates: Sichuanese merchants purchase goods in Shanghai using funds remitted through the post office or banks. Because of the complex political situation in Sichuan and the financial disorder, remittances to Shanghai always incur a heavy exchange rate loss. In the past few years, it cost about 300 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Last year, during the tense military situation, it rose to 600 or 700 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Under such shockingly high exchange rates, many firms even lost their capital, and the "Zhuang Ke" quickly stopped buying goods, bringing the entire business to a standstill. How can one expect to make a profit? Although the situation in Sichuan is now relatively stable and finances are being reorganized, the exchange rate still requires 60 to 70 yuan.</p>
<p>2.  Expensive Freight Charges: According to the post office regulations, parcels sent to Sichuan Province are exceptionally expensive. Moreover, because the conditions in various regions of Sichuan are different, freight charges are divided into two levels of treatment. The minimum is also to charge ("</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>Double the Rate"), where each parcel weighing 44 pounds requires a postage fee of four yuan and some cents; the maximum is "Triple the Rate," where a parcel of the same weight requires six yuan and some cents. Among them, the post office considers transportation to be relatively convenient in counties such as Tingjin, Hechuan, Hejiang, Luzhou, Nanxi, and Yibin, and therefore charges "Double the Rate" for each parcel, while counties such as Fushun, Neijiang, Longchang, and Guang'an are charged "Triple the Rate." Originally, merchants already felt that the "Double the Rate" was too high. Merchants in counties charged "Triple the Rate" felt even more burdened! Because the weight of "piece goods and sundries" is relatively high, it doesn't take much to pack a parcel to the required weight. Moreover, the quantity and frequency of shipments are high, so the transportation costs are considerable, which increases costs!</p>
<p>In fact, in addition to the post office, goods can also be transported by boat, which is cheaper. If shipped through the post office, "one piece of goods" (twelve parcels make one piece) calculated at the "Triple Rate," would cost 78 yuan. If shipped by boat, including water freight and transshipment fees, it only costs 9 or 10 yuan (before the export tax was exempted). Therefore, merchants in areas such as Fushun, Longchang, Neijiang, and Guang'an, which are charged the triple rate, ship silk and wool fabrics and sundries by post separately to reduce costs, while cotton fabrics are shipped by boat. Since the implementation of the unified tax system on August 1 of this year, the export tax of 17 yuan and 50 cents per piece of cotton fabric has been exempted. Therefore, each piece of goods can be reduced by more than 27 yuan compared to shipping by post. As a result, the "Zhuang Ke" in these counties are now also shipping silk and wool fabrics by boat! However, the procedures for shipping by boat are troublesome and time-consuming, and after the boat arrives in Chongqing, it still needs to be transshipped (by land). Therefore, they still hope that the post office can reduce the rates and treat them the same as Hejiang and Luzhou counties so that they can ship by post.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the "Zhuang Ke" of the "Shanghai-based Piece Goods and Sundries Traders from Sichuan" once jointly submitted a written request to the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau to ask the head office to reduce the "Triple Rate" for Fushun, Neijiang, Longchang, Guang'an, and other counties to the "Double Rate." The reasons given were: Fushun, Neijiang, and Guang'an are located on the waterfront, and water transportation is considered convenient. Longchang and Zigong, although inland, have roads accessible to automobiles, and transportation is not too difficult. In theory, they should be treated the same as Hejiang and Hechuan counties. They also said that if parcels from these counties cannot be transported directly to their destination and must be transshipped midway, resulting in higher costs, Hejiang and Luzhou counties also require transshipment, so why are the fees lower? If it is because these counties are farther away, then some counties in northwestern Sichuan are over 1,000 li away, so why are they also charged only the "Triple Rate"? The reasons for their request for a reduction in fees seemed sufficient. Therefore, on the 14th of the previous month, the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau replied: "This bureau's collection of parcel rates is based on the cost of transportation. The cost of transporting parcels to Longchang and other places is indeed higher than to Hechuan and other places, so a unified rate is charged... Furthermore, after investigating, the number of parcels sent to Longchang and other places last month was very small. If the parcel rates for these places were reduced to a single rate, would there be a sufficient increase in the number of parcels sent to these places? Please investigate and reply regarding the approximate increase in numbers, which should exceed what percentage of ten? Please investigate and reply so that it can be forwarded to the Nanjing headquarters for review..." After receiving this reply, the merchant immediately replied to the questions raised by the post office, saying that if the goods from counties such as Fushun and Neijiang were all sent by post, there would be more than 10,000 parcels per year. Although the number of parcels sent by post in August was reduced, it was because postage was too expensive and shipping offered reduced export taxes, making it much cheaper to ship by boat. If the post office could reduce a single rate, then silk and wool fabrics and sundries currently shipped by boat could all be sent by post, which would lead to significant progress in the parcel business. Recently, the post office has again provided a formal written reply, stating that the parcel rate for Neijiang, Longchang, and other counties has been reduced to "one and a half single rates" on October 7. Other places such as Fushun, Guang'an, and Zigong still need to submit separate documents to be handled further. However, the Sichuan traders feel that they have not achieved their goal, and even some counties have not been reduced at all, so they will continue to request a reduction. They believe that the post office's regulations were originally based on the transportation conditions in various regions, so the parcel rates for Sichuan vary. However, these regulations are only applicable to the Sichuan of the past, where "the road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven." Now the road to Shu is no longer "difficult," and various counties have new-style roads with long-distance buses running regularly, so transportation is undoubtedly very convenient. The transportation of parcels is not difficult, so these regulations should be changed according to the current transportation conditions in Sichuan.</p>

<h3 id="e228">The Physical Effects of Table Salt in Living Bodies <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Quyang</p>
<p>Salt is essential for everyone. Like rice, noodles, vegetables, and meat, it has become one of humanity's primary foods. But what exactly does salt do for our bodies? Most ordinary people do not know, so I would like to briefly discuss this as a piece of common scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>So-called table salt, its chemical formula is a sodium atom and a chlorine atom combined, in chemistry it is called sodium chloride. If we separate these two elements by electrical polarity, then sodium is positively charged, and chlorine is negatively charged. When they are each broken down and exist independently, they become ions, sodium becomes a positive ion, and chlorine becomes a negative ion. When table salt is dissolved in water, the dispersed crystals may still maintain the salt molecule state, but most of the molecules have sodium atoms and chlorine atoms separated into ions. Everyone knows that positive and negative electricity attract each other. Current is conducted through the proximity of these two differently charged ions, so these ions become good conductors. They themselves are also moving extraordinarily actively. All chemical reactions are not molecular affairs, but are caused by the interaction between ions. This, in analyzing the number and arrangement of electrons in the organizational state of atoms, is consistent with the theory that chemical reactions occur through the action of the outer electrons. Since ions are the tools that facilitate chemical reactions, the chemical reactions within living bodies must rely on ions to act in between to make them actively occur, which goes without saying. If there are no chemical reactions in the living body, then all metabolism, heat energy and vitality, and so on will cease.</p>
<p>Since ions are so important to living bodies, let us now examine the role of the ions decomposed from table salt in living bodies, and we can know one part of the importance of salt to life. The ions produced by the dissociation of mercury compounds, such as Hg, have a great bactericidal effect, which is naturally very important. But what about the sodium ions produced by the dissociation of table salt? It is also very important. Although it does not have a drastic effect on protoplasm, there are many sodium ions present in the tissue fluid. This kind of sodium ion has an extremely strong active inductive property, so it has an excitatory effect on the nerves. Sodium has almost become the basic condition for supporting the excitability of living bodies. If our bodies lack the components of table salt, then people will become languid and depressed to the point of lifelessness. So the saying that not eating salt causes lack of energy has a corresponding reason. Like sodium and potassium ions, because it has the ability to move actively, it can improve all metabolic processes. Not only are sodium ions in table salt very important to living bodies, but among the various negative ions in living bodies, chlorine ions are the most numerous in the blood and tissues, and they are also indispensable for general life functions. Since living bodies have the positive electrical charge possessed by positive ions, there must be negative electrical charge ions to neutralize them in order to maintain electrical balance, which is also extremely important for life phenomena.</p>
<p>Why does salt have such an important effect on living bodies? This is governed by a physical relationship. Living bodies are not completely liquid or solid, but a kind of colloidal substance that can become solid. Because the important life core of a living body is the cell. If this thing, the cell, comes into contact with water, it becomes round. According to the law of minimum surface area, surface tension occurs, which is governed by the laws of liquids. But cells are also capable of self-differentiation, and cell division is this effect, so it is also governed by the laws of solids and has the properties of solids. Because of this, most living bodies are colloidal.</p>
<p>Since living bodies are living entities in a colloidal state, they must maintain appropriate moisture and must exchange substances with external objects, and regulate their excretion and absorption in order to maintain their life. Therefore, the permeability of cell tissues is very important. However, this permeability is still a special physical effect of colloidal bodies, and it also changes due to the influence of external substances, so it is necessary to make it a suitable change for the needs of life. However, the substance solution that can maintain this appropriate regulatory effect is most suitable for a moderately saline solution. Because the osmotic pressure generated by salts is very strong, the power to absorb moisture is also very strong. If the cell has an appropriate amount of salt to maintain a certain amount of moisture, the tension of the cell is moderate. If the moisture is too little, its tension will also decrease, which means that the cell will lose its active life ability.</p>
<p>In the normal state, the osmotic pressure inside the cell is equal to the osmotic pressure inside the tissue fluid. This is because the salt concentration inside the cell is equal to the salt concentration outside the cell. If this equilibrium is broken, the living body will experience obstacles to life and create danger. Because of this, salt has become an indispensable food every day, but it should not be eaten too much. There is experimental evidence to prove that if a piece of raw meat is immersed in a very concentrated salt solution, the muscles will shrink, and its volume will be greatly reduced. Conversely, if this piece of meat is immersed in salt water with a lower salt solution concentration than that inside the meat cells, the meat will swell and its volume will increase. Also, if frog meat is immersed in sucrose water with the same osmotic pressure as frog blood, its excitability will decrease, even to the point of complete unresponsiveness. If this meat is then taken out and placed in physiological saline, its excitability will recover very quickly. There is no other reason for this, because the former lacks sodium ions in the sucrose solution, and the physiological saline has appropriate sodium ions, so one cannot cause another reaction due to electrical ion activity, and one can cause a reaction due to electrical ion activity. One presents a living barrier phenomenon, and the other can make the living body comfortably maintain its vitality. In the former example, it is because the cells are in a concentrated salt solution, because the liquid concentration is too high, and the ion activity is very strong. Instead, it frequently offends the membrane skin to give a high osmotic pressure, but it cannot pass through this membrane. However, this semi-permeable cell membrane can allow water with strong permeability to pass through alone. Therefore, if the salt concentration in the tissue fluid is greater than the concentration inside the cells, the water molecules inside the cells are drawn out by the salt, causing the cells to shrink. Conversely, if the tissue fluid has a lower concentration than the salt solution inside the cells, then the moisture in the tissue fluid will fully penetrate into the cells, and the cells will grow. Only physiological saline can give cells a suitable culture and maintain their excitability and appropriate physiological state. Otherwise, such as while blood cells in a concentrated saline solution will shrink due to loss of water, while in an over-diluted saline solution will swell and rupture due to the penetration of too much water. When a person eats too much salt and feels thirsty, the reason is simply that the moisture in the whole body's cells is excessively absorbed by the concentrated salt solution in the body fluid, resulting in a feeling of water shortage. Also, when we coat raw meat with a large amount of salt, it can prevent it from rotting. This is also because the moisture in the cells has been absorbed, making it dry and unsuitable for microorganisms to survive. The ability of cured meat to tighten the meat is the same principle.</p>
<p>But how much salt should humans eat as most appropriate? That is to say, what percentage of salt is appropriate for physiological saline that is suitable for protecting the body? According to scientific observation, a salt water with a salt content of one percent is most suitable for a saline solution that can match the osmotic pressure of cells. All higher temperature objects are suitable for one percent or 0.96, while frogs and cold-blooded animals are suitable for 0.6 to 0.7, otherwise there is a danger of shrinking blood cells, and if it is insufficient, there is a danger of rupturing blood cells, both of which are harmful to life.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Recent Economic Situation in the Nordic Countries <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Zhi</p>
<p>Generally speaking, since last year, the economies of the Nordic countries such as Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark have shown signs of improvement. This phenomenon has continued until this year.</p>
<p>First of all, looking at the trade situation of the Nordic countries, with the exception of Norway's exports decreasing somewhat, the trade volume of other countries in the first half of this year has increased compared to the same period last year. However, last year's trade increase was only due to an increase in exports, while this year's increase in imports is even greater than its exports: this can be said to be a significant difference in the trade situation in these two years. From the following table, we can know that this year, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway's import surpluses have all increased dramatically, while Finland's trade has also turned from an export surplus to an import surplus.</p>
<p>First half of 1934:</p>
<p>Imports Exports Balance Difference</p>
<p>Sweden (10,000 Kronor) 610 569 41 (Import Surplus)</p>
<p>Denmark (10,000 Kronor) 629 576 53 (Import Surplus)</p>
<p>Norway (10,000 Kronor) 371 283 88 (Import Surplus)</p>
<p>Finland (10,000 Finnish Marks) 2,187 2,268 181 (Export Surplus)</p>
<p>First half of 1935:</p>
<p>Imports Exports Import Surplus</p>
<p>Sweden (10,000 Kronor) 658 571 87</p>
<p>Denmark (10,000 Kronor) 646 604 42</p>
<p>Norway (10,000 Kronor) 382 277 105</p>
<p>Finland (10,000 Finnish Marks) 2,402 2,375 25</p>
<p>With the exception of Denmark, the increase in this import surplus can be said to be a normal phenomenon. For example, Finland's trade, the import surplus in the first half of this year is normal, while its huge export surplus in the first half of last year was an exception. Sweden's import surplus can largely be offset by its foreign investment income, and Norway's import surplus can also be offset by its shipping income. In the case of Denmark, its international balance of payments was already small last year, with expenditure exceeding income; this year, because agricultural products, which are major exports, are quite sluggish, there is even less hope for improving its international balance of payments.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is most noteworthy that the increase in imports is the significant increase in raw materials. This trend could be seen last year, and it has become more obvious this year. From this, we can imagine that the domestic industry in the Nordic countries has indeed improved in recent years.</p>
<p>In fact, Sweden's import prices for food and textiles have decreased by about 14 million Kronor compared to before, while its import of machinery has soared from 26 million Kronor to 50 million Kronor. At the same time, imports of automobiles and ships have increased by about 18 million Kronor, and imports of metals and metal products have also increased by 16 million Kronor. Finland's imports of machinery and equipment have increased by about 110 million Marks, imports of metals and metal products have increased by 87 million Marks, and imports of transportation equipment have also increased by 29 million Marks; while its imports of food and textiles have also decreased. The situation in Norway is the same, with imports of ships and machinery also soaring. — From this, it is clear that Norway, Sweden, and Finland have been making special efforts to develop domestic industry in recent years. For example, the Norwegian Parliament approved the issuance of 500,000 Kronor in bonds to build the first domestic artificial fiber factory, and also approved the issuance of 400,000 Kronor in bonds to build the first copper factory; For example, the large number of small-scale Swedish sales products and grocery factories that appeared, even in the second quarter of this year, there were already 288 newly established joint-stock companies, with a total capital of 23 million Kronor. At the end of July, it also partnered with a Swiss textile factory to start building a raw silk spinning factory that can accommodate 120 looms; such as Finland's plan to separately build artificial fiber factories with annual outputs of 10,000 tons and 15,000 tons; all of these are concrete manifestations of these three countries' efforts to develop their domestic industry.</p>
<p>Due to the development of domestic industry, the industrial production index of the four Nordic countries has naturally also shown an increasing trend. If 1930 is taken as the benchmark, then at the end of June this year, the production index of the four Nordic countries was 120 percent, which is also an increase of six points compared to 114 percent at the end of June last year. Among them, the increase in production in the textile industry and the metal industry is the most significant. The following table shows the production index situation of the three Nordic countries except Denmark!</p>
<p>Sweden (1929 = 100)</p>
<p>End of May this year Same period last year</p>
<p>Total Index 109 101</p>
<p>Export Industry 87 80</p>
<p>Domestic Industry 121 112</p>
<p>Norway (First half of 1933 = 100)</p>
<p>End of May this year Same period last year</p>
<p>Total Index 111 105</p>
<p>Export Industry 109 96</p>
<p>Domestic Industry 113 110</p>
<p>Finland (1926 = 100)</p>
<p>End of March this year Same period last year</p>
<p>Export Industry 141 133</p>
<p>Domestic Industry 138 122</p>
<p>From this table, it can be seen that the industrial production of the Nordic countries has indeed shown signs of improvement. However, the main reason for this improvement is that the rationalization of production is artificially implemented and the exploitation of workers is intensified; it is not due to natural economic development. In fact, although the production index of the Nordic countries is on the rise, the lives of ordinary workers have not improved, and the number of unemployed has not decreased in proportion to the increase in production. For example, the number of unemployed people in Sweden, from the end of May last year to the end of May this year, only decreased from 14% of the total number of people with unemployment insurance to 10.5%; in Finland, the number of unemployed people in the same period</p>
<p>Continued from page 5</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<h2>Page 27</h2>
<p>The number has only decreased from 24,000 to 13,000; the comparison between the number of unemployed people in Denmark and the total number of people registered for unemployment relief has decreased from 14% in July last year to 12.7% in July this year; and in Norway, the number of unemployed people has only decreased by 0.7% in one year since July last year.</p>
<p>As for the situation in the financial sector of the Nordic countries, there is no major change. Naturally, the phenomenon of strong demand for funds is also reflected in the assets of financial institutions, such as the increase in investment. However, most of the funds come directly from export profits, and the increase in bank investment is very small. At the same time, on the other hand, the increase in deposits is also very small, because its national income is dedicated to direct consumption, because of the use of credit unions and small-scale financial institutions in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>However, the most noteworthy thing is the deterioration of Denmark's foreign capital calculation. Except for Denmark, the foreign exchange reserves of the three Nordic countries have increased, and there is no particular anxiety in terms of currency. However, the foreign debt of the National Bank of Denmark has increased from 81 million Kronor at the end of last year to 100 million Kronor at the end of July this year. This significant increase in foreign debt is mainly due to the sluggish export of agricultural products, the amount of decrease of which has reached 20 million Kronor in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the recent economic situation in the Nordic countries. Generally speaking, although we can say that the recent economic situation in the Nordic countries has shown signs of improvement, whether this phenomenon can continue is still a question. Moreover, the four Nordic countries are not major capitalist countries. Therefore, their artificial, temporary, and partial economic improvement is of little significance in the midst of the ongoing economic panic in the entire capitalist world.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Master Wood Carver Morikawa Doen <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— An Uncollected Work</p>
<p>Wood carving is different from wood engraving: wood carving can be said to be the art of the feudal era, while wood engraving can be said to be the art of the modern era; wood carving is three-dimensional, while wood engraving is two-dimensional and combines carving with painting, so wood engraving is generally called woodcut painting.</p>
<p>Originally, Chinese wood carving was very famous, and foreigners often talked about it, but in general, we rarely see anything discussing Chinese wood carving: this has to be said to be a regret.</p>
<p>Japan also has some famous wood carvers, and the one to be introduced here is Morikawa Doen, who is known as a master wood carver. Of course, comparing Morikawa Doen's works with the famous ancient Chinese wood carvings, his artistic skills may not necessarily evoke our surprise, but when studying Japanese wood carving, he is worthy of special attention.</p>
<p>In Japan, there was a rice merchant named Kiemon, who had a son nicknamed Tomokichi. Tomokichi was very studious in his youth and loved painting and carving. Whenever he had time, he was very interested in doing his carving work. This young man was the later famous wood carving genius Morikawa Doen.</p>
<p>Speaking of Morikawa Doen, almost all elementary school students in Japan know him; his fame in carving can be said to be the same as our Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi's reputation for being proficient in calligraphy. At the age of thirteen, he formally began to study painting with a teacher. When he was eighteen in Nara, Shibata Zeshin happened to be traveling to Nara. So he went to ask for his guidance, but Shibata Zeshin said to him: "There are many ancient fine art sculptures in Nara, and your character is suitable for the study of sculpture." From then on, he devoted himself more to the study of sculpture.</p>
<p>Previously, there was a famous sculptor in Nara named Shoto. At this time, Doen could see many works of this famous painter, which enabled him to concentrate on studying sculpture and engage in the production of Nara dolls. Therefore, his works in middle age were quite similar to Shoto's knife techniques. However, Doen's works contain a realistic flavor and are full of life, which can be said to be one of his characteristics.</p>
<p>By old age, Doen's skills were of course more mature. During the Meiji era, his imitations of ancient works were called by the Japanese as unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>Among Doen's works, the particularly famous ones include: products of the National Industrial Exhibition; Meiji 10th year, Ranling King, Deer</p>
<p>Meiji 14th year, Lighting Ghost</p>
<p>Meiji 23rd year, Smiling Mask, Mask</p>
<p>Products of the American Chicago World's Fair:</p>
<p>Meiji 25th year, Male and Female Deer</p>
<p>Other:</p>
<p>Meiji 10th year, Wooden Statue of Takenouchi no Sukune</p>
<p>Meiji 16th year, Tentōki of Yufuku Temple, Hōryū-ji</p>
<p>Dogū, Two-Year-Old Statue of Prince Shotoku of Gokuraku-ji, Kimpu</p>
<p>Gilt Sutra Box of Senji Temple</p>
<p>Meiji 18th year, Mino Woodcutter, Kozobe no Maro</p>
<p>Wooden Statue of Zenfusenba Teishi</p>
<p>Meiji 28th year, Nine-Faced Kannon of Hōryū-ji</p>
<p>Doen's imitations of antiques are extremely detailed and realistic, making it simply impossible to distinguish the original object from his work. For example, some enthusiasts in Nara placed his imitation of the five-story pagoda of Hōryū-ji, the dogū, together with the original object for identification, but no one could distinguish them.</p>
<p>It is said that Doen was very honest and gentle, and did not compete with others, so people liked him very much. In the family, he also got along well with his younger siblings. Because he was very superstitious, he often accompanied his younger siblings to worship the gods. He usually ate, played, and shared his joys and sorrows with his family. In Japanese society, seeing brothers getting along very well is generally called "Morikawa style," which shows his influence on people. His wife came from a family of officials and was good at waka poetry. She had a very harmonious relationship with him and helped him greatly in all aspects; her help was indeed very significant to his success.</p>
<p>Doen's health has always been very good, and he rarely got sick. However, like many artistic geniuses of the past, he had a not-so-good habit: he loved to drink. Whether it was morning or evening, he could not leave the wine glass. Whenever he went out and returned late at night, he was mostly very drunk. Wine and carving can be said to be the two major elements on which he relied for his life, and he could not do without them. Even when he was eating, he would put the work he was carving and the wine in front of him, drinking and watching. When he was happy, he would immediately carve a stroke, and then he would be happier than anything else.</p>
<p>July 15, Meiji 27th year, was the day this genius sculptor bid farewell to the world forever. At this time, he was seventy-five years old. Many of the works he made in his life are kept in Nara and Tokyo. Many of those in Nara are forgeries, and very few of those in Tokyo are his genuine works; after the Great Tokyo Earthquake, the impact was even greater, and it is even more difficult to see his real works. Now, his works are not easy to see in Japan, which is very precious.</p>

<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>The status of overseas Chinese in Honolulu, both socially and economically, is fairly good. Among them, the most are Cantonese, most of whom are engaged in business and labor. There are lawyers and those serving in banks, but their number is small. Generally speaking, the life of overseas Chinese here is not bad, but under various restrictions, it is feared that it will be very difficult for overseas Chinese here to develop in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, in Oceania, such as Samoa and the Bismarck Archipelago, there are also about a thousand Chinese laborers each, mostly contract laborers.</p>
<p>8. The Future of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>From the above situation of overseas Chinese around the world, we can say that the overseas Chinese around the world, whether in Southeast Asia or in Europe and the Americas, have shown a trend from prosperity to decline; if the current situation continues to develop, then the future of overseas Chinese is indeed very pessimistic.</p>
<p>In recent years, the reasons why overseas Chinese in various places have been excluded everywhere and have increasingly shown a situation of decline are nothing more than these points: 1. The development of the power of overseas Chinese has aroused the jealousy of local people; 2. The development of the world economic panic has made the industry and commerce in various places depressed and the number of unemployed people has increased. Therefore, in the competition of industry and commerce, in the struggle for jobs, overseas Chinese have suffered great exclusion and restrictions; 3. Our national strength is not as good as others, and we cannot deal with the oppression and abuse suffered by overseas Chinese in various places with effective methods. Therefore, the authorities in various parts of the world can arbitrarily exclude, restrict, and oppress overseas Chinese. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Every Saturday night, at Old Ding's house, you can see Miss ×× there, without interruption. Last Saturday, ×× got drunk and cried loudly at Ding's house. Last Saturday, she got drunk again at Ding's house and went to the Flying Swallow Dance Hall to laugh loudly, which drew applause from the audience (both crying and laughing, losing her nature). The harm of alcohol is indeed not small, especially for someone like ×× in her youth. It is hoped that Old Mr. Ding will be more cautious. It is not necessary to use alcohol for entertaining guests!</p>
<p>The editor is also very enthusiastic to be the peacemaker between me, Copper Thunder, and Soft Legs. Of course, I myself am embarrassed to continue arguing. And the dispute is about the marriage of Chen Jingfang. And I said that Heaven (compared to Jingfang) is blue, and the answer is gray. This is still acceptable. Now Brother Legs answers that it is black. There is simply no need to argue anymore. Also, as the editor said: "There is so much work to do in the chaotic singing world!" Let's take a break!</p>
<p>A section of Green Silk on the 16th recorded: Recently, it was heard that Mr. ×× of the × Sound Society talked about the many scandals in the singing world, which are unparalleled. If the president of the × Learning Society is a... Later, at the flood relief variety show, he shook and shook and became an × Learning Society. After reading this passage, I can't help but find it a bit funny. I don't know if the × Sound Society is the Odd Sound Society. Can Mr. ×× be Xu Qi? If so, may I ask what kind of organization the Odd Sound Society is, and what is the difference between it and the × Learning Society? Is the president also a scoundrel who is illiterate like the snake leader of the × Learning Society? Mr. ×× of the × Sound Society talking about the × Learning Society is no different from blinding himself and scolding others for being blind!</p>
<p>The "bunch" of this newspaper yesterday, signed "New People's Society," had a passage about the scope, number of people, and good and bad things in the singing group. It seems a bit too "exclusive"! It is recorded that "now" the broadcasting... (but the Bright Moon Society has now stopped broadcasting). The smallest scope is the Bright Plum Troupe (this is not necessarily true. What is the difference between Bright Plum and Political Rose, Lilac, and Nightingale?) The largest number of people is the veteran Swallow Society (this is praised too much, I am afraid there are more artists!) The smallest number of people is the Lilac Society (this is too selfish. The Bright Plum Troupe only sings in two orchestras, which can be considered one of the smallest numbers of people.) The best is the Shanghai Society (I don't know what standard to use. Remember that there was the veteran Rose, and later the newly emerging Datong, Lilac, etc.) The worst is Bai　Men and Hawaii (this is also too extreme. How about these two "societies" compared to Commercial, Academic, Odd Sound, and Xia Guang, etc. "societies"? "New People's" Society, please consider it before writing. Forgive me for being presumptuous! (Above, Copper Thunder)</p>
<p>Recently, someone has been giving nicknames to the broadcasting ladies. Is it praise or scolding? (I don't understand)</p>
<p>The "Cheating Piano" of the Three Missing One is specially recorded. Copper Thunder recorded the snake leader of the Group of Orioles cheating Fan Hualin, and the chief of the Pine Wind Troupe cheating the mandolin, but he did not know that the Ningbo Weiqiang Troupe had a chief who cheated the piano. It is truly a perfect group! (Everyone, please pay attention in the future)</p>
<p>The White Surprise Society broadcasts again (everyone, please pay attention)</p>
<p>The pictorials and publications published today are almost the same in content. I don't know which publication is accurate and which is copied? (The reporter does not understand) (Above, New People's Society)</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Continental Radio Station, the Shanghai Swallow Society will broadcast various novel songs on the radio station every night from 10:00 to 10:45 starting on the 21st. (Flying Ear)</p>

<p>The long-promoted masterpiece of the famous cartoonist Zhang Hongfei, the purely humorous "Zhang Mulang" pictorial, will be published on the first of next month. It is said that the style of the magazine is exquisite, with a color cover, a total of eight thick pages, finely printed on heavy Swedish newspaper, which is extremely valuable. Its humor is enough to surpass George Bernard Shaw, and the pictures are comparable to those of the American Haenigsen. It is a rare glorious harvest in the cartoon world in 1935. The price is six yuan, but for the sake of popular purchase, it is specially priced at only fifteen cents. Major bookstores and magazine companies have it for sale. It is said that the magazine is published by the Dazhong Comic Society.</p>

<p>— White Wood</p>
<p>"Hu Ping's acting skills in 'The Beginning of a Person' have indeed improved a lot." - This is the general consensus, and I am not just blindly praising her.</p>
<p>In fact, Hu Ping's acting skills are indeed improving day by day, and each play is better than the last. This is certainly due to the increase in experience, but mainly due to her willingness to work hard. Therefore, it is said: "Nothing is difficult in the world, as long as you have the will." Hu Ping is the most appropriate example.</p>
<p>Now, her new work "Hero of the Times" is about to meet the audience. She plays a "beauty" in the play, a romantic socialite. Because the personality is suitable, coupled with the usual willingness to work hard, she obviously has a very pleasant harvest. However, what must be specially mentioned here is her pure Mandarin and accurate pronunciation. Every word is pronounced very clearly, and the pitch of the voice is also very detailed. Therefore, in "Hero of the Times," not only has her acting skills made further progress, but also her lines have achieved extremely satisfactory success. So it can be said: "Hu Ping is indeed a rare and excellent sound film actress."</p>

<p>Floods, droughts... continuous natural and man-made disasters are tormenting China, which is in deep water.</p>
<p>The Cultural Film Company's "Parents and Children" takes the tragic and heartbreaking natural and man-made disasters as the background.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, in the barren fields, a tragedy of human hell unfolded: - A large group of unkempt refugees, men, women, old and young, don't know how many. Some of them have lost their parents, and some have lost their children. They have all been ruined by natural and man-made disasters. Now they are all struggling on the line of death due to hunger and cold, tears flowing from their bloodshot eyes. There are also many white-haired old men and infants in swaddling clothes, all groaning in human hell. Li Junpan, Xi Qiuxia, Hu Yichun, and Wu Yin also play the parents and children of a disaster-stricken family in Peidong Township..." Two cameras kept rolling, and tragic pictures of refugees were captured on camera. Therefore, the village scenes of "Parents and Children" are wailing ghosts and gods, shocking the world, and the content of "Parents and Children" is tragic, moving, and worthy of singing and crying.</p>
<p>The Cultural Company's location shooting team finished this scene of human hell and returned singing the "Parents and Children" song.</p>
