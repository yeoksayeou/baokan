<p>— 仁</p>
<p>晚近六年來。海外銀市。升靡定。兎起鶻落瞬息千變。我國以銀為本位。首當其衝。故我國貨幣幣値。隨之而呈一揚一抑之狀。經濟社會亦呈一頓一挫之態。回想已往金貴銀賤之時。國人莫不惶惶然有憂色。以為銀賤之結果。財政上將有「鎊虧」之患。貿易上將使「結價」過高。弊害百出。於是紛請禁現銀入口者有之。請禁標金投機者亦有之。再察最近銀貴金賤之情形。國人又莫不惶惶然有憂色。以為銀貴之結果。將使出口停滯。入超增多。又若有百害而無一利。於是請禁銀出口者有之。請禁投機之買賣者亦有之。是銀價不變則已。苟有劇變。不論為升為降。其足使國人惶慮不寧則一也。</p>
<p>據美國電訊。美參議員麥克迦倫.參院提議。主廢白銀法案中（一）白銀國有。（二）管理或限制白銀買賣。（三）白銀盈餘收稅百分之五十之三條文。此項提議。雖為白銀派所反對。未必能通過。但由此可以見羅斯福白銀政策之進行。前途未必極為順利。然此案萬一通過。則卽無異於宣吿羅氏政策之破綻。而世界銀市必將重生一大波瀾。若然。則一波未平。一波又起。不又將使國人惶惶然有憂色乎。</p>
<p>我國貨幣之隨銀價而生恐慌。致使經濟社會不安。在表面視之。似其原因皆在幣材為銀之故。因此。近人有以為易銀為紙。或易銀為金。或易銀為「能力本位」之後。便可解救數年來貨幣之恐慌。而安定中國經濟社會。然吾人若就貨幣之本質而觀察之。則貨幣之為物。並不興人類之生以俱來。在往昔間接交換之前。卽無所謂貨幣。設若將來人類社會中之間接交換制度歸於消滅。則貨幣當亦興之以俱去。在人類綿延不絕之歷史中。貨幣僅能存在於間接交換社會之中。良以貨幣為交換之媒介物。惟在間接交換制度之下需要之。至於幣材之由普通物財（如我國最早之貝幣）。進而至於金屬。更進而至於紙幣。乃由於經濟社會之進化使然。是故。社會之進化為因。而貨幣之變化為果。若欲强以幣材之變化促社會進化。無異倒果為因。此事之决不可能者也。</p>
<p>今日中國經濟社會。生產旣極落後。分配又不健全。故一有外來變動。便感不寧。年來之銀價升沉。卽為外來變動之一。若問銀價之上落。與中國之經濟。究屬孰為利而孰為害。則應之者必曰。銀價升於中國有害。銀價落。於中國亦有害。由此。足見銀價變化。不過為一導因。而此導因所以能促成恐慌之危機者。其基本原因實在於中國經濟組織本質之不健全。譬之爆竹。中藏火藥。以火綫引之可以爆發。以火柴引之亦可以爆發。此火綫與火柴。皆不過為導因。而欲使爆竹根本不能爆發。則惟有先去其為爆發基因之火藥而後可。不此之圖。別無良策。此理甚明。無待煩言。</p>
<p>由上所論。足見貨幣不過為一社會之產物。而貨幣之變化。乃以交換社會之進化為前提。而今日中國經濟社會之不振。其基因似亦不在於貨幣。設若我國今日國民經濟上之根本缺陷不除。則縱令將今日之銀本位易為金。為紙。或為「能力」於事似皆無多大之裨補。或且反因幣制之更張。幣値之變動。而使社會一般。俱感受其不寗。故就貨幣之本質而討論今日我國之幣制。竊謂我國今日已統一之幣制。大有保持之必要。能一面保持一部分旣已統一之幣制。一面以最速及最有效之方策。求國民經濟之自立。則我國之經濟社會自不難漸上進化之軌道。經濟社會果能蒸蒸日上。循進化之軌道以邁進。則幣制自亦不愁其不能改進。職是之由。我國幣制之能改進與否。其根本的關鍵。實不在勉强改革幣材。亦不在美國修改白銀案之提議能否成為事實。却在中國經濟社會本身之缺陷能否設法消除。此則國人似宜加以明辨者也。</p>

<p>籌委會組織　展覽事宜、旣略規定如上、行政院為鄭重起見、特在國內組織籌備委員會、統籌辦理、即於上年十月組織成立、</p>

<p>數月來籌備　該會任務頗繁、尤以展品之徵選·保管·運輸·及計劃安全時最為重要、故該會特另組專門委員會、司展品之徵選、組保管委員會、司展品之保管、組預展會辦事處、司展覽之籌備、因各部分人員分工合作、努力進行、故籌辦僅二三個月、亦已布置就緒、</p>

<p>（國民新聞社柏林通訊）一九三六年世界之眼光、將再注向柏林、因第十一次世界運動大會（阿林比亞大會）將在德京舉行、此非德意志一國或歐洲之事、至今已有四十一國報名參加、按其意義之重大、故會塲亦應有巨大之建樂、以達大會之目的、記者特訪籌備會秘書長蒂姆博士、探詢一切、據談如次、</p>
<p>工程浩大</p>
<p>蒂氏云、建築阿林比亞大會之工程、按原定程序、積極進行、吾人不可輕視、會塲之面積為一三零黑格達（一黑格達合華一畝餘）、處處皆須建築、因此會塲之建築、誠一巨大之工程、塲中之帝特立愛克ettrick看台、地基已按序準備、約今年可以竣工、然後即從事內部之建築、原有細心作成之運動塲、亦能應用、至開會時之大會塲、及道經之地基、今冬可吿完成、至一九三五年終即可全部竣工、游泳地已着手建築、現其中之一部份練習塲已吿落成、今決於首次在柏林開闢紅色炭灰跑道、鶴克塲（Hahoy）現已動工、並建樂七十六尺高之鐘樓、阿林比亞鐘懸於其上、此鐘係由博河默Boehmer鑄鋼廠所捐助者、近巳鑄成矣、跑馬塲亦已準備動工其中之馬廐則於今年可築成然後繼續栽種花木、舖設草塲、塲中建築之最偉大部份為帝特立愛克觀看台可容二萬觀客、現已略顯雛形、並可供大樂獻藝之用、在此亦有運動器之設備、如拳術比賽等等、此處尙有專術比賽塲以花崗石舖成、</p>
<p>女子宿舍</p>
<p>運動塲中尙有一部份女子住宿之所、及運動會台之一部、巳經完成、此外於德意志運動塲中將建一輝煌之圓形大廳、圖形為著名工程師威爾納馬斯所製、現已漸次實地施行、使為一九三六年柏林成為世界最大之運動設備塲、德元首希特勒、因鑒於此短時期內、其工程已有如是之進展、故其對於各種工程、甚為樂觀、雖多數專家、以其中之各種問題、至今尙未完全解决、然此種懸案、吾人當設法解决之、使全部工程、得以調和、現致力於此種大工程者、其數足有一萬二千人之多、今年需人之處更多、惟除關於純粹建築上之問題外、現尙有內部全體之裝修、如程序單應由五種文字印成、至一九三五年如大會辦事處築成時、則全塲建築及其他一切、亦已完備、關於此種問題、大部現巳解决矣、總之吾人成完成阿林比亞、不僅以外部建築吿成而已、即大會凡應數行之工程中各項運動、亦必盡一已之能、竭力為之、</p>
<p>德國選拔</p>
<p>記者又往訪籌備會監督主任布施、詢問選手之選拔與訓練問題、據談、吾德意志之阿林比亞競賽員、仍按原定程序繼續訓練、惟此種訓練、第須注重阿林比亞比賽正式開始時、能有特殊之表現、平素冬季在鶴克塲訓練、及至夏季仍在此塲决賽、所有阿林比亞參加員、亦將刻苦訓練、俟一九三六年、可得其最高形式之表現、參加各員、無論於任何情形之下、均應更迭拔粹、堅忍決戰、因凡有决門心者、其人必有有目標、自可於阿林比亞塲中以遂其目的、而能獲得為選手之人自有其高碩之聲望、</p>
<p>特別訓練</p>
<p>然後施以特別敎訓、以循環賽跑或各種輕巧運動比賽、游泳比賽、而選出全國之假定冠軍、比乃最可能之事也、各受訓之訓練員、負責社會立塲之義務、對參加比賽員、須加以鼓勵、例如參加比賽員中有仍在失業狀態下者、應代為覓得相當之位置、技術優良者、與以更好之職業、此固吾人不可忽視運動之心理要素也、惟此次須按序合法訓練、比賽表演時、各項演員預備甚多、故可隨時調換補充、因各演員隊中、有自始至終不令其自知參加運動與否、俾免卸除其心理之責任、一九三六年之比賽程序、由比賽學校及評釗所負責施行、評判所因各種運動之不同、分成各種評判圑、均由專家分別組成、若至阿林比亞預賽時、可山評判圑選出最優代表隊、去年（一九三四）訓練之成績、顯見增加、因各訓練員所走之路綫、甚為正確、此其進步之證據也、但我國之阿林比亞選手、現仍不確定、因後進之運動家有强烈之突進、至大會開幕時、尙當有飛躍進展、若一任各選乎時時有堅固之地位、則老選手必將阻止後進者之地位、且將防止其特殊之努力、以維持自已之地位、若至一九三六年阿林比亞大會開幕時、以吾人之確計、則各種準備情形更益完善矣云云、</p>

<p>比賽開始、東華即取攻勢、十分鐘時、李義臣運球推進、敵內衛誤犯手球、被罰十二碼、李踢而未中、東華遂失去良機、旋李義臣傳球與戴、戴不辱使命、得而即射、球由左角而入、未幾賈幼良得機聞角球、李義臣迫不及待、臨空一腳、巧獲第二球</p>

<p>山東煤尤其是膠濟煤、最近供求趨勢、在數年前因時局不安、沿綫各種產漢凋零、故供求方面均在二百萬噸左右、但其後時局漸趨安定、沿綫各種產業復興、從而煤之需要增加、加之自前年五月提高保護關稅後、日煤及撫順煤漸次减少、代之而行者為國煤即膠濟煤需要激增、尤其是品質優良的博山煤、際此時食應爲活躍時期、惟國煤鑛設備幼稚、未能充分供給此項需要、至為可惜、近來雖各鑛為增加生產計、有擴張設備之計劃、但値此令融困難之秋、是否能實現却是一問題、</p>
<p>一方面中興煤、在數年前雖因時局不安（設備較完美）及各種關係、生產不能如意、但自時局有轉機後、卽依據所定計劃進行、現在每年生產增加、目前每年已突破一百萬噸以上、巳如上述、膠濟煤產額、今後仍未能十分期望、惟需要方面、則沿綫及沿海各口岸、均增加不已、目前有供不應求之槪、而上海市塲、如今後關稅無多大變化、則膠濟煤及中興煤需要必激增、結果上海市塲必由膠濟煤·中興煤·及開平煤三者供給其大部份需要、由此三者供給能力觀之、今後上海市塲競爭、亦不致於十分激烈、將來煤鑛一業、由一般經濟而言、世界各業均趨衰落、煤鑛亦必隨之衰落、但目前因供不應求、及關稅保護乃至沿海各口岸需要孔急等特殊原因、或不致同陷衰落、茲將膠濟煤過去五年間產額運銷及其他各種情形、列表於次、</p>

<p>— 乾綽恒久</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！假使有人問你：「我國的國旗是怎麼樣的？「我相信你一定很快的回答說：「靑天白日滿地紅。」但是假使他再問你：「我國的國旗含有什麼意義？是誰創造的？」我想一定有很多小朋友，還不十分明白吧？現在讓我來告訴你：</p>
<p>我國的國旗是革命志士陸皓東先生，在廣州起義前所創造的。國旗上的靑，白，紅三色是代表自由，平等，博愛·白日上的十二隻角是代表子，丑，寅，卯，辰，巳，午，未，申，酉，戌，亥十二個時辰的。</p>
<p>小朋友！我國國旗的意義，你現在都明白了嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c185">法拉第的童年 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友！發電機是誰發明的？大家都知道是一位美國的大科學家愛迪生，不錯，但是愛迪生等怎樣才能運用來創造電燈，電車，電話，種種電力機械呢？那末，就是這位法拉第呀！因為世界上的人，知道愛迪生的很多，而曉得法拉第的却少，所以我來講一段他的小史，給你們聽聽吧！</p>
<p>法拉第是一個鐵匠的兒子，當然家境很不寬裕，並且不讀書，和打鐵沒有關係；那裏還會有給法拉第進學校去讀書呢！在十三歲時，開始跟利波，做他的徒弟學訂書，共做了七年，這個徒弟性子非常奇怪，一面訂書；一面讀書；在這時期中，曾裝訂過一部百科全書，書裏面有一篇論文，題目是「電」，他便抱了一個宏願要向電進攻，於是他省吃儉用把餘下來的錢，去買了儀器，藥品，幹那種化學的把戲。</p>
<p>一天，他聽說皇家學會享有盛名的化學家戴裴氏，要在倫敦公開演講，那時有一位顧客來，向他買東西，他便問這位顧客，肯不肯做個東請他到倫敦去聽演講，那客人滿口應承，買了四張人塲券送給他。法拉第便進城聽講，一面聽，一面記下來，回店後，他寫一封長信給戴裴，並將筆記給他看，要求一見，後來戴裴回信請他去談話，那時又要求在皇家學會做工，使他可以學科學。最後竟被他發明了發電機和它的原理，法拉第無疑地為為化世界的開山祖師。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>紅黑分家</p>
<p>一個暖和的春天，科學先生又登臺了。他手裏拿着一個馬蹄形的東西，舉起來對臺下說道：</p>
<p>「小朋友們，你們知道這是什麼東西，這是一塊蹄磁，俗語呌做「吸鐵石」，它的性質是能够吸引鋼鐵的。今天我們要用它來做一套很有意思的戲法。」</p>
<p>他說罷，就從衣袋裏拿出一隻碟子，一把銼刀，和一枚鏽釘來。接着用銼刀在鏽釘上銼了好一會，那碟子裏就鋪滿了黑色的鐵屑和紅色的繡粉。他又把碟子搖了幾下，使這兩樣東西混和了。</p>
<p>「現在，這紅色的鐵粉和黑色的鐵屑併成一家了。」科學先生說：「但是我們要把他們分開來，紅的管紅的，黑的管黑的，小朋友，你們有什麽妥當的方法麽？」</p>
<p>台下的小朋友都搖頭，覺得這樣微細的東西，旣不能用手取，又不能用—簡直是沒有辦法。</p>
<p>「哈哈！再容易也沒有了！你們看……」科學先生拿起蹄磁，靠近碟子底，果然，那黑色的鐵屑紛紛跳躍起來，黏附到蹄磁的頭上去，這蹄磁頭上頓時好像生滿了細毛似的，很是好看。</p>
<p>「現在，這黑的都吸在蹄磁上，紅的都留在碟子裏，這就呌「紅黑分家。」」</p>
<p>於是臺下起了一陣拍掌聲。</p>
<p>「為什麼蹄磁只能吸鐵屑而不能吸鏽粉呢？原來在潮濕的空氣中，空氣裏的養氣與釘上的鐵化合，因而成形，到了這個時候，鏽的性質已經和鐵的性質不同了；因此，蹄磁也就吸不起它了。</p>
<p>「諸位要表演這套戲法，蹄磁是少不了的，它可以向賣儀器的店家買到—上海是四馬路的科學儀器館—每個八九毛大洋，有了這蹄磁，我們還可以玩別的許多種戲法；這些，我下次表演給你們看。」</p>

<p>光陰過的多快呵，眨眨眼，一年一度的旅行季節—春假又在目前啦！</p>
<p>小朋友，你們這次的春假，至少有十天遊玩，你們不可媽媽虎虎地虛度了這大好光陰，那末在春假內終天埋頭讀書嗎？不，決不，這春氣蕩漾，春光美麗的日子，是不適宜於一味讀書的。我們該到淸秀，雄巍的名山，或歷史上的名勝處去拜訪，去旅行。這不但可以舒適我們的身心，並且能够增進我們的學識。太史公文章的奇妙處，完全從遊歷獲得呢。</p>
<p>現在把敏兒的旅行計劃，介紹給諸位參考一下罷。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們每天打掃房屋，微細的塵埃，在陰黑地方，人目是看不見的，如在太陽光照射到的所在，就可以看出塵埃散滿空中了。這許多塵埃，看起來好像很輕的飛散空中，其實內中夾雜了水點砂片金屬屑，微菌衛生蟲等各種東西，並不算輕。水比空氣重七百倍，水分浮散空中很多，不過水滴有如雨點大的，那落下的速度就快，若水點的直徑，為十分之一米里，其落下的速度，要三秒鐘，直徑為百分之一米里，落下的速度，要五分鐘，直徑千分之一米里的水點，須八時間十五分，直徑一萬分之一的水點，那要八百時間了。霧為水分所變成，霧的落下速度，在五分以上十分以下，產埃本來因着於室內各處，受風的振動，飛散到空中，可是塵埃中因為有各式各樣的物質，所以落下的速度，也千差萬別了，那重的過了一二秒鐘，就會落到地面，輕的過了一天一月，仍舊飛散在空中，不能落下的。所以我們打掃房屋時，應當多開窗戶，通風洩氣，使室內被掃帚鷄毛帚磹子等所激起的座埃，受外面吹進的風所勁，可以吹到窗戶外面去，然而我們天天掃除室內，重的塵埃，雖然漸漸的落下地面，或因着在壁間興其他器具上，而輕的塵埃，因為落下的速度很慢，有經過一天的，有經過二三天的，仍在空中飛散，那末，可說室內，終年有塵埃飛着呢。</p>

<p>— 華楠</p>
<p>小朋友！我問你：你在運動以後，出了汗，過了些時，為什麽覺得身上會冷起來？</p>
<p>小朋友！請你先想一想，然後再來看我的回答。</p>
<p>原來在你停止運動以後，汗就停止出來了。但巳經出了的汗怎樣呢？它就蒸發，在蒸發的時候，它需要很多的熱量，這熱量就在你身上吸收，因此，你感到身上冷起來了。</p>
<p>所以，小朋友！當你運動以後，决不可因了熱而再脫去衣服，應當稍停幾分鐘後，卽把脫去的衣服穿好，否則就會受凉的。</p>

<p>錦衣玉食的膏梁子弟和流浪街頭的苦兒，顯然從貧富中劃出苦樂的分野來！兒童節似乎是為貴族人家點綴的！窮苦人家的苦孩子。一些感受不到什麽？我也是苦兒隊中的一份子，記得幼時在慈母手中綫裏，獲受敎育洗禮，學校離開家裏，雖然有三五里路，還得要走！雨雪天氣，因免跋涉，只帶些糙米粉？躱在校廚一角，乞廚司少許沸水，調和當午餐，有時買些山芋果腹，並不顧及人家的譏笑！同學們的走讀的，却都有錢在校中膳食，當時雖萬分悲哀！但抱定苦讀用功的志向！每屆校中考試，次次是名列前茅的，我於是深信人的手和腦是萬能！「積財千萬，不如薄技在身」，我奉勸現在的苦兒同志，你們要知道兒童節的眞諦！健全自己的身體，努力學問，從艱難困苦中奮鬨出來！達到經濟獨立，有瓶造事業為大衆謀幸福的一天！</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>辛白得的第四次航行</p>
<p>我那家庭生活的樂趣，一會兒就把找心中的恐怖排除掉了，不多時我便重又出發，這一次却取道波斯，一面做買賣，一面看那沒見過的景物。</p>
<p>末後我到了一個港口，就由那邊帶了我的貨物揚帆出發。我們隨處入港，我的貨物出賣得很好，在一個短時間內幾乎把我所携帶的全都卸去了。</p>
<p>一天去陸地很遠，大風忽起，雖是一切事都戶做到，而那船不久就成了破船，喪失了幾命</p>
<p>我的好運却又有利於我了，因為我抓住了一塊板，上面正有幾個朋友在着。我們被潮水掃到一個小島的岸邊，恰在高而乾燥的所在。</p>
<p>在那邊我們尋得水果吃和一處淸泉可飮。我們終夜守在岸邊。但到了第二天太陽上升時，我們就起身出發，向幾所小屋走去，瞧去離我們是很遠的。</p>
<p>我們走近時，有一羣黑人走上來，帶我們到他們的家裏。他們便使我們坐了下來，給我們一種草本；向我們作勢示意，說我們是可以吃這草本的。</p>
<p>我的朋友們依言吃了，但我見那些黑人却並沒有吃，因此我想道定是害我們的一種詭計。我並不吃我的，却也好在沒有吃，因為我那可憐的朋友們一會兒就失了知覺，不知道他們是在那裏又說些甚麽話。</p>
<p>接着黑人們又把米和油餧給我們吃，我那朋友吃了好多，但我並不多吃，因我如今早已看透了這些計畫了。那草本是要失去我們的意志和動作之力，那米是要使我們肥壯—因為這些黑人是吃人肉的。</p>
<p>不久我就覺得我的思想是對了，因為他們依次吃掉我的朋友們，但我太瘦了，並不觸動我。他們給我自由，在那小屋的近邊徘徊着，不過那怕死之念，使我一天天的瘦了，可是他們要等我肥壯了才吃，我的身子不健康便變做了我的莫大福利，我的性命也借此保住了。</p>
<p>一天我略略離遠了那小屋於是決意逃生。那時屋子近邊只有一老人在着，任他呼喚也不在意。</p>

<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們每天吃飯的時候，不是總有蔬菜佐飯的嗎？蔬菜的種類非常多，但是我們吃他們的時候，總不外吃他們根，莖，葉，果這幾種。有些蔬采可以吃他的菜，也可以吃他的根，或吃他的果，也有的蔬菜，只能吃他的根，却不能吃他的葉。普通的蔬菜，有下列四種區別。</p>
<p>（一）葉菜類　　這一種菜，我們主要是吃他的葉，其餘各部雖然有時也可以吃，但總不是主要部分。像（圖一）的白菜，油菜，我們看他葉的部分很肥大，但是莖也可以吃，葱蒜分不出莖葉，但大槪把他包括在葉菜類中的。</p>
<p>（二）根菜類　　這一類蔬菜，葉相莖是不能供食的，因為他們的養料都在根上，根部發達得很肥大。如（圖二）所示的洋葱，番薯，蘿蔔，蕪靑，這一類就是。</p>
<p>（三）莖菜類</p>
<p>這一類供給我們食的是莖的一部。（圖三）所示的萵苣，芹菜，茭白，都是，他們的葉雖然也長得很茂盛，但是他們的滋味，便不及莖部好。</p>
<p>（四）果菜類</p>
<p>這類蔬菜的根葉莖都不能供食，而他們的瓜果，却滋味很好。如（圖四）所示的南瓜，匣子，辣茄，蒲子等都是吃他們的果實。</p>
<p>小朋友們吃蔬菜的時候，分得出那一種菜是供給我們吃那一部分的，這是很有趣味的研究問題呀！</p>

<h3 id="c195">德國婦女的厄運 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 沉湮</p>
<p>中華日報（二月十八日柏林路透電）「今日當道發出紅黑字之布告，上有列刑二大字。於是析林民衆咸知二女間諜卽前白格男爵夫人與那資納夫人行將行刑矣。二婦皆因同謀以德國動員計盡，售與某外國而獲罪。在德國承平時代，因犯此罪而受處決者，此猶第一次。男爵夫人衣尋常獄服，首蒞刑臺，錮斧一下，頭顱滾入滿盛米屑之藍，波蘭之計盡而被控云。」</p>
<p>本報（三月三十一日柏林國民電）今日有二十五歲之少婦一人被判斬首，其罪狀為自身在歌臺舞榭縱情取樂，而任令家中稺子三人饑餓至死。</p>
<p>本報（四月五日倫敦路透電）（一）今日下院開會時，保守黨議員華特好斯問及避居倫敦某屋之德婦二人，昨日暴亡事，查二婦一為德國社會黨兼著作家法比安博士，一為威姆夫人，亦著作家，現信皆自由服毒而死，華氏請當局應設法查明此事真相，因聞二婦之死，與外國政治團體有關也。</p>
<p>（二）據巴黎律師公會領袖喬斐里今日宣稱，避居倫敦二德婦之暴卒，現悉並非出於自殺云，避居巴黎人德人聯二婦之死，皆惴惴不安，而不知託身何地，始可自保，二婦曾暴露國社黨委員在倫敦之活動。</p>
<p>讀了以上幾則新聞，知道德國於三個月中，計判決斬首的女子共三人。避居倫敦，既非自殺又非病魔，而是暴卒的計二人。</p>
<p>誰都知道，德國婦女，自歐戰以來，參加了各種職業陣綫，一九一九年起更獲得了參政權，她們在生產功働和政權的參與上，多有了相當的成果。但最近碰到了善於利用的希特勒，他利用幾百萬德國婦女的投票權，做了國社黨的支柱，等到他的獨裁成功，一翻臉就要她們回到家庭裏去，不許參加政治，禁止從事有報酬的勞働。這是希特拉利用了婦女，而給與婦女的大好酬報！</p>
<p>在這種情形下，德國婦女，不乖地住在家裏，相夫育子，而要做間諜，做叛黨的間諜，當然罪該萬死了。然地按諸號稱明文國家的法律，斬首的刑罰，都嫌它太不文明而廢止了，希特勒重來應用，不失為覇王本色！</p>
<p>浪漫女子的產生，本有其社會根由，希特勒不作根本的治療，而一味苛責片面。該浪漫女子的任家中稺子飢餓致死，而自身在歌台舞榭取樂，也許尚有別的苦衷，德國中下婦女，類都困於生計，況在「將女子的職業讓出來給男子」的口號下，失業女子的生活，當然成問題，所以該浪漫女子，大約是生不得而去尋樂的，不然，家中稺子三人，怎會飢餓致死呢？然而希特勒不尋取使他們飢餓至死之總因，而將一弱女子致死，致死的方法，也是文明國家已經不敢領教的酷刑　斬首」！</p>
<p>至於二德婦暴卒於倫敦的消息，雖真相未明，然而細讀上項新聞，知道是被脅致死，已無疑義了。避居他國而作本國的政治活動，當然不能卽抓來斬首，於是易斬首而為使之暴卒，方法不可說不巧。烏倫夫人說：「德國國社黨的勝利，得力於國婦女的很多，」可是國社黨勝利以後，德國婦女怎樣？仍借烏倫夫人的話來回答：「德國現在的婦女，完全被消滅了數十年來艱難苦鬥得來的若干成果，而逆轉於世紀的狀態了。」（參看本刊希特勒治下的婦女）</p>
<p>德國婦女「逆轉於中世紀的狀態了，」上面的幾則新聞，更是這結論的明證。</p>

<h3 id="c196">第四講　古代奴隸制社會的婦女　第一節奴隸制國家與婦女的奴隸化 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>自從原始的母權制沒落與父權制確立以後，在民族社會裏，發生了許多難解決的予盾與對立。卽是說，發生了奴隸和奴隸所有者，富者和貧者，農民和手工業者，特權者了無權者等種種不同的社會階層，在他們之間有着相反的利害關係，常常引起對立的鬥爭，這種鬥爭不但捲起了社會的混亂，甚至要使全社會陷於共倒同亡的危機，於是乎，為着解決這予盾，就需要一種仲裁機關，這機關就是國家的最原始的形態。可是，隨着社會的經濟權力的集中與加強，牠終於成了奴隸所有者或富者用以抑壓奴隸或貧者的權力機關了。牠的最古而最典型的實例就是古代希臘及羅馬的奴隸勞動制國家。</p>
<p>國家在母權和父權的鬥爭上，也作了相當有效的處置。這點，許多社會學者也不甚注意，但我想，這是一個值得研究的問題。</p>
<p>由母權社會推移到本質上完全不同的父權社會，當是社會的一大變革，而這變革並不是那樣「和平」地實行的，相反的，我們在許多傳說中可以看到父權和母權的鬥爭，就是說，在戰鬥的民族間，還有許多關於女項雄（Amagon）的傳說。她們率領許多強有力的娘子軍參加戰爭，即使在現在非洲的蠻族達哥那人的女王也是率領着武裝的女衛隊。這樣看來，男子須經過長期的鬥爭才能奪取婦女的支配橫是無疑的，國家在這方面的任務非常的重要，卽規定關於男女權利問題的明文法，使婦女在法律上處於非人的地位，這點，不用說古代社會，即使在現代文明國家的法律中，也充分表現國家的抑壓女權的機關。</p>
<p>古代希臘及羅馬國家，是建設了人類史上最初的燦爛的文明，但這所謂文明，實在是建築於婦女的犧牲和奴隸的血汗上面的。據說在西紀前五世紀頃，希臘雅典市的全住民二十萬人中，奴隸占十萬人，自由民僅二萬人，其餘八萬人是無權利的外地人。僅僅這二萬自由民是有支配權的特殊階級，他們是吸取十萬奴隸的膏血，剝奪全體婦女的人權而窮奢極侈，盡情歡樂，這便是奴隸社會的「文明」的特徵！</p>
<p>關於婦女的奴隸化問題，倍倍爾這樣說道：「她們是最先做奴隸的人類！「奴隸」這種人未曾存在之前，婦女已經是奴隸了！」（婦女與社會）</p>
<p>不過，婦女的奴隸化和一部分男子的成為奴隸，是有着本質的差異。因為第一「婦女」並不屬於社會的階級範疇，牠衹是抽象的性的的區別，所以，在階級社會，「婦女」自體亦必有階級的分化，第二婦女地位的低落。是基固於他們失去在國民經濟上重要的生產勞動的權利，而不是由於勞動的強制。這是我們要特別注意的。</p>
<p>哥崙泰是這樣說着：「許多人以為婦女的隸屬和無權利，是基因於財產私有權的確立，但這是錯誤的見解。……婦女的隸屬化是原因於勞動的性的分業，即男子負擔生產勞動，婦女負擔其補助勞動的事情，這種分業愈甚，婦女所受的束轉便愈來得厲害。……私有財產制是衹不過助長婦女的隸屬化而已。（婦人勞動革命）</p>
<p>舉一個例說，在民族社會，農耕婦女的地位，還優於牧畜氏族的婦女地位，這因為農耕勞動是適合於婦女，而婦女在生產上占重要地位，牧畜勞動適合於男子，而婦女在生產上處補助地位的原故。因此，雖則在母權制崩壞和財產私有制確立以後，但婦女在生產上占重要地位的農耕民族中，婦女的權利比較長久的持績下去。不過，財產私有制逐漸把民族共同體經濟分裂為獨立的個人主義的家族經濟，而在家族內部，也引起勞動的性的分業，換言之，婦女是負擔家庭的廚房的工作，男子是負擔家庭外的生產功動。另一方面，隨着經濟技術的發達，發生了牧畜及農業外的種種職業，因而發現種種專門家，如陶工，皮革工，職物工，商人，武士僧侶等，這些職業部出男子一手包辦，婦女衹處的補助地位，結果，婦女在國民經濟上便成為不重要的東西。這樣也就成為生育子女，服侍丈夫的家庭奴隸了。奴隸制社會乃至一切男權社會的婦女地位，也只有從這個見地去觀穿才能得到正確的理解。</p>
<p>講到希臘羅馬的婦女地位，那已經不能用概括的概念來說明的。屬於自由民的婦女和屬於奴隸的婦女是屬於完全相異的階級範疇，前者和後者是有截然不同的生活樣式和身分關係，但這相異衹不過前者是自由民的奴隸，後者是奴隸的奴隸罷了。有着支配權的自由民的妻或女，較之女奴隸自然有她們自已的東西，而是她們的父或夫的特權的殘滓。她們自身是一無所有，衹在家庭裏做洗衣織布，燒飯，養孩子，指導家僕等的工作。而且在男人的絕對壓制之下做長期的賣淫生活而已。至於女奴隸，對男奴隸的隸屬關係是比較緩慢的。這因為男女都是同樣的無權利，不自由和隸屬，同樣的受勞役，苦惱，疲倦，飢餓等的苦難，這裏還有什麼隸屬可說！衹有對自自民的憤怒和反抗的情熱在燒着他們的心坎罷了。</p>

<h3 id="c198">希特勒治下的德國婦女 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 烏倫夫人講詞順譯</p>
<p>本文是德國前民主黨護員烏倫夫人的演講詞一九三四年九月二十七日紐約舉行第四屆時事問題協議會時，她在倫敦播音台演講的，全文敘述最近德國婦女的情形。特節譯之，以供開心婦女問題者的參考　譯者</p>
<p>德國國社黨的勝利，得力於德國婦女的狠多希特勒握政權的前數年，勞苦者和間層的生活水凖是非常低下的，所以，曾經為了麵包而勞動的數百萬婦女，不得已的在生活戰綫上苦鬥！許多中間層的婦女，亦衹能屈就書記，店員及其他的低級地位。而勞動婦女則更擔負着主婦，母親，勞動者的三重重荷，他們都盼望着有一天能夠避免這為着衣食而碰死命的勞動。平常，職業婦女能夠感到經濟的，精神的獨立幸福的極少，多半是認職業為無法避免的重荷！</p>
<p>希特勒的一場騙局</p>
<p>在這情形底下，希特勒剛好提出：所有男子都應該給予可以充分養活其家族的工錢的口號。這是德國婦女日夜盼望着的一件事情。同時他又：所有的年輕女性都可以得到人各有夫的結婚保證。被這熱望燃燒着的幾百萬婦女，遂以其投標權作為國社黨的支柱，在男女分別舉行的選舉區，因此婦女的投票率比男子高得多。</p>
<p>可是，到了國黨掌握政權的第十八個月，不特婦女們的大願無絲毫實現，而且女性的地位都轉化於更不利的狀態！一九一八年憲法上所規定的法律上，經濟上，政治上的男女平等權，卒至於完全廢棄！</p>
<p>國社黨力唱妻為母乃「女性的天職」的主張。認女性的參與公生活及智的問題為近代生活的頺廢，德加坦的結果，一九三四年二月十二日卑爾斯在國社黨婦女大會席上說道：「我們在公共生活的一切分野中使女性退却。這不但不是女性的不名譽之事，却是回復女性名譽之事。」</p>
<p>無視女性的向上</p>
<p>事實上，國社黨對於近代女性所造成的種種成果是無關心的，他們沒有看到女子離開廚房而參加種種智的活動以後的好現象，他們衹看到外的變化罷了。</p>
<p>成為此種女性觀之一的，就是女子教育的大變動。新法律，大學女生不得超過全學生教之一成。不久以前，普魯士各大學開了為女子開放大學的二十五週年紀念大會，這時候，德國新聞是這標寫着：</p>
<p>「女子獲得教育權二十五週年的今日，女性又再逢到使她們先行離開大學的時代的轉換期。」</p>
<p>女子教育的制限</p>
<p>在國社黨的學校，少女們不必受研究科學的凖備教育。對於新時代的女性所應研究的事情，都認為無關心的必要。</p>
<p>在某定期刋物，「德國婦女與其任務」一文中，如下的叙述新初等教育令。</p>
<p>「我們要明瞭今日之女學校究應授以何種智識，我以為民族及家庭；關於遺傳的科學；海外的德國魂；防空知識等都是教育全綫的前衛。同時，游泳，烹飪，遠足，家庭音樂，家庭教育等也是非學不可的。</p>
<p>此外，軍事訓練也成為婦女及兒童的重要課程之一。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c199">漢口的多寶林 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>—代價一百文—</p>
<p>賣淫亦如產生它的社會中之其他的買賣一樣，為適合顧主們的身份與腰包，它在貨與價格上，有由上品到下下品的區別。而且這項公認的合法商品—娼妓，正像不可一日缺的米糧似的，無論貴若王侯，賤若糞夫，它都有以供應之。</p>
<p>就拿漢口鎮來說罷，娼妓的等級，有數百元乃至一千元一樣的花酒，也有夜度資僅只一元或數角不等的地方，並且我還知道，一處日間營業，每次代價二百文的半公半私的娼窟。</p>
<p>凡是住在中街的人，只要聽到一多寶林二二倆字，男人們不論老少都要露那焦黃的牙齒，臉上掛起一絲似輕蔑似貪饞的微笑；女人們呢，彷佛這三字　　　　　　　　似的，不是裝做沒聽見，便是抽身　開。　　　，「多寶林」雖只是一個小　　的名字，田鄰小巷的實際情形，也實在　　　。第一，在　着的盡頭，有一個丈兄方的塘，塘真是終年發綠的死水塘邊不遠有一個很大的公共廁所。第三，離廁所不到兩尺遠，就是一口供人洗滌又供人飲食的井。第四，也就是最大的實，在那口井的左鄰右近散佈着五六家污積而暗黑的小平房，這此平房便是專營出賣女人肉體的小商店了。</p>
<p>因為這些商店是半公半私的性質，所以沒有什麼組織，每家是主婦親自出馬，但為一家之主的丈夫，則可別為三類，一是失業的游民，一是染有惡疾不能謀生的，一是癮君子。而且那四寶中，其餘的三寶，皆是助成這第四寶發展以至於長成的因數。</p>
<p>第一寶的死水塘內，有幾家染坊，終年在內漂布，所漂的布盡是行銷四鄉的藍印花布。這些漂布工人的徵薄工資，在百物昂貴的漢口當然養不起家，所以這此暫時或永久的單身漢，無形中便構成了那五六家小商店的經常主顧。</p>
<p>第二寶的公共廁所對於這五六家的有利，更超過於死水塘。鄰近許多成本只在一元左右的小販，小商家的店員，作坊裏的工友，或年長的學徒—這些人都是迫於生活，不能正則地解決他們的性慾；因為他們中間的大多數是討不起老婆的，即有些在家鄉已討過老婆，但娘兒們限於丈夫的經濟力，不得不終年住在鄉下或房錢與生活費均較賤的市外。而且內地的作坊與小商店，對職員們的待遇，仍保留着中世紀家庭手工業時代的那種形態。他們—職工與學徒，除廢暦新年時有幾天休假能回家，平時是被迫住在主人家中，即他們的整部時間教已出賣給主人了。這些可憐的職工與學徒，每當上那公廁所入廁時，只要身邊揣得有足夠的銅元，他們抵不過自身內心的熬煎，也抵不過目前赫赫然誘惑，所以每每便躡乎躡脚踏進了那虛掩着的板門。人們時常還可望見一些挑擔賣熱食的，賣糖果的，賣零星用品的小販們進巷落入過廁後，一轉眼間，便連人帶擔子也都消逝於那板門後了。</p>
<p>第三寶的井與第一寶的水塘，對這娼窟的繁榮上，有同等大的力量。這口井的最大消費者，當推中街的一家唯一的大醬園××井既是公的，所以縱使一口氣把井水用光了，也沒有人來干涉。醬園的老板明鋻到了這一點，雖然園裏裝有自來水，可是造醬，製醬油，洗瓜，洗菜，清瓜，淹菜，全是用井水。每當見初園裏開始了製醬油的工作，以及秋初開始了清瓜淹菜的工作時，該店後園的工人們，像搬家的螞蟻似的，從天亮直到黃昏，只見他們把井水　搶　擔往後園裏挑。沒有幾年工夫，醬園老板的第二位姨太太已討進了們。人們總說那混滲有尿和屎的井水好使他發了財。其實，沒有人力，井水能自已變醬嗎？與老板比較起來，後園的工人們，真是窮苦得像乞丐一樣。兩三塊錢的工資養不活鄉下的老婆，所以他們的性慾，也只乘挑水的空兒，嘗嘗那兩百文的貨品。</p>
<p>這些年半私半公的娼妓，因為是薄利主義，在警察不常來打麼煩的日子，每天的收入，也可養活一家人。但被踏在重重鐵蹄之下，無辦法而出此下策的她們，現在雖是一家的唯一生產者，可是老公一不如意，也要對他們加以惡打惡罵，守會則一向將她們認為不足人齒的天生的淫婦。更可憐的是在這種社會情形之下，她們的婦兒也被迫得不能不踏着她們的血跡走下滅亡之途。這五六家中，有兩家是有女兒的。一個名叫彩雲，一個名呌巧雲。彩雲的父母都是三十多的年紀，她十三歲時，就被送入戲院學戲去了。巧雲的命運便兩樣了，她的父親已過五十，母親也只四十多，兩人每日飯可不吃，鴉片却不能少，因此她在十四歲那年，兩親看在金錢面上，把她嫁給了一個比她父親更長兩歲的老頭子。是做第六或第七位姨太太，太家還弄不清白。</p>

<p>— 關露</p>
<p>四月六日</p>
<p>今天連小姐在這裏吃午飯，吃過飯她就一直坐在我房裏。其實連小姐跑到我們這裏來倒像沒什麼趣味似的。本來她是不必常來的，一則她是和五太太的關係，同時她又是從小被我們老太太撫養大的。聽說她的媽在生了她就因產後熱死了，後來繼母不愛她，從小讓奶媽把她抱到鄉下去養，長到十二歲才讓我們的老太太帶加來。後來繼母又扣着她的　讓她住在學校裏讀書。所以她常常說：「無論什麼關係都是錢的關係，假如錢不作怪，什麼壞事都會發生」。她為着從小的遭遇不好，到現在身體還養不康健。她說她不怪她的後母，只怪他的父親太有錢。她是決計不想和後母的孩子爭父親的財產的。</p>
<p>連小姐這人雖然有些主　人莫明其妙，可是有時候說出兩句話來倒很能中人的心事。比方她今天說：「女人的過分打扮完全是為了男人」。我覺得這話很些對。從前我過着掛牌生活的時候，那種每天裏的九道胭脂七道粉的生活，差不多沒有一個同伴不討厭牠，但是為着要做生意，要接待客人，繼然有時候疲倦得臉都不想洗，寗可不洗臉，胭脂和粉是要糊上去的。</p>
<p>後來要嫁人了，我想着有了固定的丈夫，這種太煩鎖的打扮可以免去了。那知道有了丈夫還是一樣的，你不高興打扮，做丈夫的要逼着你打扮；他說娶了老婆彷佛是買一件吃的東西樣，是要適口而美觀的。後來我把這句話拿去問了許多高貴的太太，她們說她們的丈夫都是抱着同樣的見解，不過說法不同罷了。一個男人花了許多錢娶一個女人，不是為了她的身體和面貌還是為着什麼呢？</p>
<p>四月七日</p>
<p>我懷的小孩子已經六個多月了，一天到晚都感着疲倦，但是×長每天叫我那樣晚地陪着他。出去還逼着我穿頂高跟的鞋，我真不願意穿上那樣的鞋走一步路！</p>
<p>昨天又是為了穿鞋和他爭了幾句，他馬上說「現在有得給你穿，你還不穿，好像跟誰擺架子似的。你看，我往後不買好鞋給你穿了，我買了送唐姑娘穿」！</p>
<p>唐姑娘，瘟娼！她買鞋，買什麼給她我都早知道，連他要娶她我都知道了，還用着他這時候用這種方法來向我表示麼！</p>
<p>我真羨慕連小姐，雖然她穿得樸索，錢用得不寬敞一點，但是她不用別人的錢，她什到都自由，她的身體和一切都是自已的。即使往後結了婚我也要勸她不要靠丈夫，還是自已做事。</p>
<p>四月二十日</p>
<p>這向只管生病，肚朋又一天天地大起來，×長大概是覺着我憔悴了，竟然連着幾天不回來。不，據說是他嫌我老了；人家都說和男人接近多了的女人往往在青年的時候就衰老了。</p>
<p>把女人當作狐狸精去玩的是男人，等到把她們玩憔悴了，扔棄到黑漆漆的馬路上的也是男人。聽說×長現在要娶一個十九歲的姑娘。</p>
<p>我想孩子生出了以後，決計到杭州去找九姨，叫她介紹我進產科醫院去學看護，或者進婦女補習學校，或者……無論如何這×長的太太是不當了！</p>
<p>男人厭棄了一個女人，她生的兒女大概總不會討厭的，兒女也是他生的，不是女人帶來的。連小姐說叫我達觀一點，帶着孩子的女人是沒有地方去的；我想走的時候和×長先解決了這個問題，反正是我自已生的孩子，往後是有權利來看牠的！</p>
<p>四月二十五日</p>
<p>陳媽和我說，昨天×長告訴老太太，呌她勸我現在就住到病院裏去。據昨天王院長說：我的身體太壞；因了精神上的過分勞動，現在已經趨於「歇斯脫理」狀態了。並且得過子宮病的產婦，最怕的就是流產或早產。</p>
<p>×長還說假如我不肯進病院的話，就叫老太太向我把病勢說重些，說我需要和異隔離，作最清靜的修養。</p>
<p>「歇斯脫理」，子宮不健全，我自已還不知道，要人家向我過分的誇張嗎？我是最希望早一天進醫院去，離開別人的家！更希望流產，流產以後可免除母性的負担了。誰都知道，離了婚的女人，最難生活的就是生下了有兒女。因為兒女不是國家和社會的，是父母的，父母破裂了感情，兒女不會不幸，而最關心兒女的多半不是父親，是母親。</p>

<p>— 蔣忍</p>
<p>人怎樣才能構造成一個有意思而高貴的人生，這實在是一個極値得使人有興味去討論的問題。當然，我們這裏所說的人生，並不是單純的只求到物質上的滿足便作為圓滿的享樂主義，而是一種有進取心，有丈夫氣，有百折不撓而能繼之以實行的精神的。也就是說：為人應當具有自由的精神和獨立的人格，而使人生有意義起來。</p>
<p>在任何一個時期，在任何一個地帶，我們决不會相信說竟沒有一個人能像過去的歷史上給我們印象極深的偉人或學者一樣的聰明能幹，然而到了最後，依然走在墮落的途徑上，或者彷彿把搖籃故意靠近了墳墓似的，只一霎那就無聞於世的與草本同朽了。為什麽同機是一個人，甚至同樣具有智慧的人，而有這樣不同的區別呢？這無疑的是由於缺乏一種猛進的勇氣，純潔高貴的英雄心，和保守個入的特性和能力所致。因為一個人要達到任何一種事業或學問的最理想的境域，實非具有上述三個條件不可。不過，要達到這二個條件，最要的手段還是要歸納到思想和行為上的獨立。</p>
<p>海或洋裏的水，分析起來是由於一點一滴集合而成。世界，這複雜而又廣大的社會，同樣也是由各個人的努力而造成的。目前社會上的大改革，一切永垂不朽的眞理，以及在機械方面種種的新發明，在當初也不過是個人腦海中的一個計劃，唇舌上的宣示，與一個新奇的幻想而已。不過，後來這種計劃，宣示，和幻想，經過了他們多次努力縝密的推究，於是纔成功了今日的所謂眞理。這就是明白的告訴你，依賴上世上最無謂的浪費，只有運用你獨立的精神來訓練你自己，才是使你成為出類拔萃的人物的唯一出路。同時。我們在這裹還可以引用一個良好的例子來作一個比較。柯律勒基（Coleridge）是一個具有不平學的腦力而極奇妙的人，可是因為缺乏獨立的精神，以致永遠的只陷在幻想和計劃之中而沒有實踐的成績。記得蘭姆給他朋友的信裹說，「柯律勒基現在是死了！據說他遺下來關於討論神學和論理學的文字有四萬多篇，可是其中却沒在一篇是寫完的。」由此可以知道，無論他的天資怎樣的頴悟，要是缺乏了獨立邁進的勇氣，失敗依然是不能避免的。</p>
<p>雖然，談到獨立，有些人就會聯想到要被社會上的人認為不圓活，不近人情。因此以為獨立是瘋子講的話；卽或不然，也一定是超人的行為。於是為了表面上生活的關係，依然隨波逐流的浮沉着。顯然，這是極大的錯誤。的確，倘使個人的特性過份的趨於怪僻，不能獨立在這世界上，自然是一件更麻煩的事情；不過，在今日是，對於這項過慮實在是不需要，所應當過慮的倒是習於依賴成性者的太多。</p>
<p>彼得司曾經這麽說：「要做一個不平常的人，必須先要有獨立的精神。」是的，我們為人，應當像一座屹立擋風的高山，不要像一枝被風吹搖着的草。這樣，我想我們的生活，一定會從這種獨特的精神之中，產生出無窮的意義來。同時，我們平凡的人生，也不難因此而可以提高起來了。</p>

<h3 id="c203">東江的農村婦女 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>廣東蕉嶺通訉</p>
<p>農村沒有服飾華麗的摩登小姐，也沒有「性慾玩具」的太太，祇有樸素，吃苦，耐勞的農婦——所謂『農村婦女』，便含有勞作的意義。然而她們的勞作也並不單是限於「家庭瑣務』（如洗衣，煮飯，養小孩），而且還要種菜、鋤草，收豆，割麥……。這情形很普遍，無論中國的南方北方全是一樣。所以農村婦女的工作，比農夫還要繁雜，她們的生活，比男子還要艱苦。不過，許多地方的姍女，因為受了纏腳的惡毒，不能走下冰田，也不能擔負過重的工作（如挑糞，推車，抬石頭），所以在農作上，究竟處於帮閒的地位。但是這情形，在廣東的東江就完全不同了。</p>
<p>那兒的婦女在身體方面可說是已完全解放了：）不　腳，不束胸。因此體力發育得很强壯，所做的工作同男子沒有分別。同時她們不但在操作上表現得很健全，而且還能獨立撑持家務，應付社會，——對兒女是個良好的母親，在田土裏等於强壯的農夫，在交易上也是有『經紀』的生意人。所謂『婦女倚靠男子生活」的話，給這些事實打得紛碎了！</p>
<p>這次我隨軍出發粵東，路綫是貫穿東江（經惠州，河源，老隆，五華，梅縣達蕉嶺），經過了許多村落和城市；過了惠州便迎着挑祖的婦女，她們挑的東西有糧食，有柴草。據當地人說，有些是把自己的農產品運到市塲出賣，其餘則是專做買賈的小販。這情形却也少見，雖然在別省有婦女運糧食趕布集，然而最多也祇背負，手提而已！同時在別處（尤其是北方）的市塲，大都是男子做買賣，可是，在東江，每逢集日（小市稱『圩』，三天一『集」），全是婦女的擁擠。</p>
<p>在這陽春二月，正是春耕的時期，沿路上都見着耙田的婦女。她們的袖管捲得很高，褲兒紮到跨間，健美的腕臂，圓滑的腿脛，很自然的裸露在外面，然而她們不是誘惑男人，而是為了工作的便利和敏捷。</p>
<p>我們的部隊，由惠州到蕉嶺（粵東的一縣），全是步行，沿路的軍需品，大都由婦女挑運。重十餘斤的子彈箱，她們最少可挑六箱，這麼沉重的祖子，一天居然能跑六十多里，並且到了目的地，還要趕着回家。東江的山嶺很多，對於挑祖的人特別費力，可是她們的速度並不比軍隊的行列緩慢。至於在平路上，那簡直是受我們隊伍的限制了。由此可見身體自然發展的婦女並不比男子嬌嫩梁弱。</p>
<p>她們挑着擔兒，雜在我們『武士」的行列中，一點不拘束，也一點不怕羞，她們已了解賣勞力換飯吃是一種正當的職業，用不着表現出一種無聊的羞態。所以沿路上都是有設有笑，每逢扒山的時候便唱着山歌，徘遺疲乏，祇要有一人提頭，全體就同聲唱和。這歌聲雖趕不上摩登小姐唱的「桃花江」那麽婉和，那麼柔媚，但雄壯，激昂却也令人興奮，可惜我是外路人，聽不懂歌中的詞句！</p>
<p>他們的衣服大都是很短（恰蓋着臀部）的土布衫，胸前掛着圍裙，預備揩拭汗珠。頭上挽着一條布巾，作用是遮陽光，小雨，褲見也很短，赤條條的腳沒有鞋襪的掩護。總之，她們的裝束很原始，很簡單，——自然，其中也有比較愛修飾的，大槪說來，不外穿伴灰白的洋布衫，或裙邊繡花，頭巾備有紅藍白三條。這裝束絲毫說不上時髦，可是加在一個少女身上，却也別有一番風韻，再加上胸部凸出，乳峯微露，更顯得健美可愛。</p>
<p>她們的飯食也很粗劣，幾乎全是菜蔬佐餐。她們每次給別人挑東西的時候，如果要到幾堂路（十里為『一堂」）以外去，便先在家裏預備一包乾的食料帶在身邊，到了腸胃翻騰體力疲憊的時候，纔放下擔兒，一壁揩汗珠，一壁吞食冷料。如果眞的硬噎得難挨時，纔摸出一仙兩仙去買滾水泡飯（廣東一個小銅子呌『一仙』，在東江呌『一累」）。</p>
<p>這種節省法在我們看來似覺過分，然而在她們却有不得已的苦衷呵！因為每天拍賣勞力和血汗的結果，平均不撾換得五六角小洋（挑子彈是每堂路二角，然而這是例外），這微小的數目，除了維持個人必要的生活，還要養活不能勞働的父母，或是啼哭着的見女。家庭的重擔壓在她們的肩頭，不格外節省又怎樣辦呢？</p>
<p>過這苦力生活的婦女，分別起來一部分還有微少的田產，農忙時耕種自己的田士，若有閒暇，便找尋出賣殘餘勞力的機會。其餘大都是沒有土地的僱傭勞働者，除了農忙時帮零工，主要的職業便是挑運東西。可是這項職業並不固定，也同城市的碼頭工人一樣，要有挑運的機會，對於生活纔有着落。所以她們每天很早的拿着生產工具（厚竹瑰），鵠侯在交通要道上，若遇僱主便擁着搶奪生意。</p>
<p>東江的農村姍女，其所以要獨立撐住家務，自謀生活，大半是由於男子出外經商，或是跑到南洋做工去了（南洋的華僑，要算東江和閩西最多）。不管經商，做工，都同家庭隔絕很遠，有許多已經消息斷絕，根本沒有照顧家庭。我曾經問過許多婦女，她們的丈夫或父兄有離家十餘年的，也有七八年的，早不知生死存亡了，但她們對於他們却並未絕望，認為終有一天會掙錢回來的！</p>

<h3 id="c204">旅歐的華人 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 梁學文</p>
<p>法國馬賽通訉</p>
<p>在旅歐的華人中，如果要從外觀上來分等級，那是不能簡單地仿照在我們祖國內那樣的標準去判別的。因為西裝革履是我們祖國裏分別上等華人和社會中間層的智識分子的唯一標誌，然而在旅歐的華人中，由於西裝革履是沒有例外的普遍的服制，所以至多只能在摩登不摩登，質料的好壞，淸潔不淸潔上略有分別而已。雖然通常也有穿着工衣，常服，禮服的各種不同形色的華人在街上出現，但一到禮拜日，大多數都是穿着相當華美的常服，手腕上掛着手杖，甚至也有掛着西洋女子，以小紳士的形色，出現於街頭，電車上、田野間的。</p>
<p>留居歐洲的華人，那些最上層的達官，貴人，寓公們，除掉偶爾在參觀甚麽地方的機會中，在甚麽展覽會中，可以一覩尊顏外，他們只出沒淤外國的上等社會的宴會，娛樂塲，會議廳裏。所以他們所作何事，生活情形怎樣，這是我們所不知道的。留學生，、這是旅歐華人中的主要成分，自費生官費生都有，除掉一小部分外，因為他們不是家境很好的富家子弟，便是有國家或地方政府的津貼的，所以縱然由於他們仍在求學時代，並不是有許多用不完的黃白之物供他們充分地揮雀，但在普通華人中，總算是過普超人一等的優閑生活的。讀書，我們不敢抹殺一切，其中自然亦有刻苦自勵的，然而專門在跳舞，看戲，和外國少女講交際戀愛的人却也不少。</p>
<p>商人，這就說來可憐了。像中國的大出口商，雖間或派得有住歐經理人，推銷員，但那是鳳毛麟角地十分少見，就有也不過幾個住在人不知鬼不曉的旅館裏，自賃的單間屋子裏的旅客而已。如果要說他們是莊客，那麽把他們放在</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>歐洲那些大工商業城市裏，也不過是最起碼的六七八等以下的經紀人罷了。像歐美人在中國那樣開着巨大的公司，洋行，銀行，賃着甚至自己建造着幾層十幾層的洋樓作為營業機關的中國商人，那是連影子也看不見的。如果要說商業，那麼就只有馬賽，里昂，巴黎，倫敦，柏林那些大都會裏，至多只有三五家規模小得像鴿子籠樣的中國飯舖，而且大半還是賣給中國人吃，賺自家人的錢來維持他們的生活而已。經營這種小生意的，是久留歐洲積了幾文錢的華工，動工儉學生和學生，並不算甚麽正式的商人。</p>
<p>至於旅歐的下等華人，其中分子便複雜了，其來源和所經營的生活方式也不齊一·就其來源說，大部分是歐洲大戰時恊約國在華募來的華工，其次是一九一九至二一年來法的勤工儉學生。他們中間的大部分雖已歸國，但久留歐洲者亦不少，特別是法國，自然，散居在德，比等國的，亦大有人在。據說大戰中招募過來的華工，在英在法初來時都完全受的軍事管理，或者被驅到戰綫後方工作，或者帮助他們在工廠中生產。但無論在那裏都由陸軍部特設營房收納，在軍法管理下工作，工畢住在一處，有黑人衛兵看守着，不能自由外出。稍有不如意的地方，便要受軍法制裁，鞭笞坐黑牢是他們的常事，在法國甚至還要被提解到馬賽坐水牢，或遣送回國。他們的工資，那是廉到無以復加的，除伙食外，通常只能給普通工資的三分之一作零用。受這種待遇的華工，他們雖然感到痛苦，可是不能逃亡，因為他們來歐時都沒有護照、逃出來，一切旅館住家均不敢招待。偶爾逃了出來，就　成了黑號華工，隨時都有被拘捕的危險，所以他們只能偷偷摸摸地在各處流浪着。這種狀况一直繼續到一九二四年左右才改善了，不願回國的可以領取居留護照，自由在外找工作。他們當工人時，大都因為智識的缺乏，素無工藝學養，所以全靠用體力作着苦工，工資一般的比所在國的工人低五分之一左右。現在留在歐洲的華工，比較地都有一些技能了，生活情形也比從前好一點，也有因刻苦地過着非人生活，遂得稍有儲蓄的，但很不容易　錢回中國，而且有些已和西洋婦女結了婚　成立了家庭，太部分都是不願再回中國的。</p>
<p>勤工儉學生，本是抱着以工求學的宏大志願來歐洲的，但這不過是他們當時的幻想，來歐後，在戰後的經濟恐慌，失業恐慌中，他們曾過過一時期的很可憐的生活。其中專吃洋山薯，得鼓脹病而死的有人，窮迫之至，至於消極自殺的也有人，不過多數都已歸國。現在留在歐洲的都多少有點技能，他們已完全變成工人了。不過因為他們在國內都是知識分子出身，所以其中有的是外國文學得很好，也有的是研究得有相當的學問。現在留在歐洲的，也有許多都結了婚，再不作回國之想了。</p>
<p>還有一部分小商人，他們流蕩在歐洲的許多城市中，販賣着小玩意過生活。他們所販賣的東西，不過石頭彫的小人，猴猻，杯，碗之類的玩具而已。這種人以靑田等縣的人為最多。</p>
<p>所有這些下等華人，除勤工儉學生外，其中有許多分子都是很不純粹的。比如在歐戰募去的華工中，有的是在張勳那裏當過兵，因他的復辟陰謀失敗後失了業，才被招到外國去，也有犯過殺人案，强盜案而借此逃亡到外國去的。至於那些非正式應募來歐洲的中國人，那幾乎全是偷運過來的。在往來中國和歐洲的輪船上，有的是中國茶房和生火的水手，他們不但有偷運軍火，嗎啡，鴉片的，並且也偷運着這類的流浪人。凡是通這條水路的，沒有巨額的路費也可以到歐洲來。你能找着中國的茶房火夫，只要交最低船價的二分之一或三分之一，如果是他們的親戚至友，甚至可以不出錢，他們就把你偷載在輪船尾巴的火夫艙裏睡覺，吃飯和他們一起，遇着外國人來查時，你可以躱在船的尾巴安舵那個唯一的露在外邊的洞裏去，這樣就可以避過一切。但也有偶爾被發現的，被發現了那是非常危險，有時洋大人竟立刻把你推下海去。</p>
<p>因為這些華人中有的是三頭六臂的角色，所以在他們中間也有經營着鴉片，嗎啡的生涯的，甚至在戰後有的還過着偷竊，强盜的生活，犯着殺人案件。這樣的華人在歐洲一般的最被賤視，雖然大多數中國人都一樣被賤視着。下等華人在歐洲簡直是一種黃色奴隸，和黑色奴隸沒有甚麽差別，他們的不幸並不因到了文明的歐洲就幸運起來了。</p>

<h3 id="c205">精神分析學批判 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 益聲</p>
<p>在一八八〇年，維也納的醫生勃洛伊埃爾曾用催眠術治愈了一個患歇斯特里的少婦。這事情引起了有名的弗羅伊特的注意，他卽刻决定和勃洛伊埃爾醫生共同研究，結果是兩人共同地完成「歇斯特里底研究」的著作。以後弗羅伊特更繼續研究，終於完成了有名的精神分析學的理論體系。</p>
<p>弗羅伊特所完成的精神分析學不僅在一般心理學及病理心理學上顯示了它底光輝，而且還被應用到了歷史，宗敎，藝術方面來；一般弗羅伊特主義者都認為精神分析學是萬能的，所有人類社會的一切現象，在他們看來，都只有用精神分析學的法則去研究才能理解。現在，弗羅伊特主義不僅盛行於西歐，就是在比較落後的東亞，日本與中國也有其信徒。廚川白村在其有名的「苦悶的象徵」一書中對於精神分析學曾給與了這樣的宣傳：「這學說（精神分析）不但在精神病學上，卽在敎育學和社會問題的研究者也發生了影響；又因為弗羅伊特對於機智、夢，傳說，文藝創作的心理之類，都加以解釋，所以在今日，便是文藝批評之間，也很有應用這學說的人們了。而且連Freudian　Romanti　Ciam這樣的奇特的新名詞，也聽到了。」由此可見精神分析學在一般學術界中佔着何等重要的地位了。</p>
<p>弗羅伊特主義，主要地是由於特別重視人類底性本能而發生的。依弗羅伊特看來，人類自出世以來，在嬰兒時期就有性的慾求。嬰兒之吸乳，嬰兒之被抱在其母親底溫暖的懷中，都是在滿足其性慾。因為人類有愛異性的行為，所以在弗羅伊特主義者看來，男孩必然是愛他底母親而認為其父親是其情敵，反之，女兒則是偏愛着她底父親的。但是，到了相當的年齢時，人們底性的慾求及其潛在的一切慾望，便為倫理道德等所限制，有些慾望是不能意識地明白地表現出來的了。弗羅伊特說，、「我們無意識的領域，猶如」所巨大的休息室，在其中，心理的各種傾向恰如生物似的擠在一起。這休息室有一間較小的房子，像客室似的連着。在這當中，雖同樣有意識存在着，但從休息室到客室的入口，有守衛者，監現各種心的傾向，在這裏加以檢查，，倘若覺得不對，卽不許其走入客室。……各種傾向自始就是無意識的。因為走到入口被守衛禁阻退回，於是遂成為有意識的了。這時候，我們說起來便是所謂加以壓抑。」可是，這種被壓抑的慾望，並不因被壓抑而消失，在意識的檢閱放鬆了的時候，便會復活轉來，這便構成了光怪奇離的夢。同時，因為在意識的檢閱之下，人類底許多嬰兒時期的慾望不能顯明地直接地表現，常常是在想像中將其排除出來，象徵出來：於是，藝術，乃至於宗敎，歷史以及許多社侖現象便產生了。若依弗羅伊特主義者，則人類所製造的棍棒，鉛筆等都是男生殖器的象徵，花瓶等物都是女生殖器的象徵；在他們看來，我們底一切言論行動與性的慾求都有不可分離的關係，就是一般的政治運動，都只是「嬰兒的和有史以前的時代的那種淫亂的慾望的表現。」</p>
<p>這樣的精神分析學究竟具有何等的價値呢？對於牠，我們現在要加以簡要的批判。自然，我們並不像叔本華那樣，說性愛是不存在的：實際上性愛在人生中佔有極重要的地位；但是，像弗羅伊特主義者那樣地把性愛底重要性誇大起來，說人間底一切現象，都與人類底性的慾求有最密切的關係，那便是失之過當了。　拿　術來說吧，因為性愛在人生中佔有極重要的地位，所以自來的一切彫刻家，畫家，詩人，小說家，在其作品中，不是以愛的故事為題材，便是穿插着一些關於性愛的事態：為了要增加其藝術品的威人力量，藝術家所採　的形式？所採用的人類底語言和行動，往往與人間的性愛都有關係，有時甚至可說是由藝術家本身的性的慾求所發出來的。因此，在研究藝術作品時，應用精神分析學去分析作家所表現的性愛生活去去分析作家底心靈，對於我們未嘗沒有許多帮助。但是，人類不僅有生殖的本能，而且還要努力求生存；同時所謂生殖，不消說，還是要在能够生存之下才能遂行的。因之，在人類底全部生活中並不是只有性愛生活，為了生存的社會生活是人生底第一意義，所謂性愛生活底意義乃是在這個第一義之下發生的。藝術是人類底社會生活之反映，所以我們必須要由人類底社會生活去說明藝術，誇大性愛之重要性的精神分析學只能帮助我們底研究，不能以之作為我們研究藝術的唯一依據。很顯然的，在狩獵時代出現的彫刻，是彫刻着許多與那時的人類生活有極大關係的野牛野鹿的，若從精神分析學的見地來研究，則那些彫刻着的野牛野鹿與人類底性愛有什麼直接關係呢？在過去中國底封建的農業社會中產生了描畫箱物描畫自然風景的風景畫，這些風景畫，由精神分析學者看來，與性愛又有什麼直接關係呢？同時，就以那些以性愛的故事為題材的藝術作品來說，也不是單由精神分析學去研究所能理解的。因為人類底一切言論行動乃至其心理和潛意識，都要受其社會生活之嚴格的規定，其性愛的心理與行為當然也不能獨立於這規定之外去自由發展，所以生活在各時代各社會中的人底性愛觀念與行為，便因其生活不同而各自差異了。「如在希臘，我們有柏拉圖的戀愛，在歐爾法時代有牧歌的戀愛，在巡遊詩人時代有騎士的戀愛，在配特來爾加及但丁時代有神秘的戀愛，在盧梭，夏多白里安及歌德時代則有浪漫的並感傷的戀愛。」（伊科維茲，所以，如果不從社會的見地去研究那些表現了由各時代各社會所產生的戀愛觀念與行為的藝術作品，想要完全借精神分析學去說明，其結果必然是徒勞，是絕對不能理解那些藝術作品的。</p>

<p>「我也不曉得伍太爺是怎麽算法；記得今年秋天祇問他借了三擔六斗陳米，挑來的當兒還看見有不少的糠壳攙雜着，到將算起錢一把兄就是四十塊！剛剛長根說：你爸爸還和伍太爺說了半天好話，他睬也不睬地一口咬定非得四十塊錢不行。聽說你爸爸這時還在伍太爺家裏，再要想不出法子還他的租，那到了區公所就糟了！」</p>
<p>「三擔六斗米，要四十塊錢？」我眞有點不敢相信。</p>
<p>「鎭上借米都是加息錢的。」阿福插進一句。</p>
<p>「家裏一點錢的法子也想不出麼？」我帶在身上的錢雖還剩下四十幾元，但想到不久回上海就得要一筆旅費，不免又這樣向母親問着。</p>
<p>「這當兒鄉下是見不到洋錢的：今早長根聽說伍太爺逼着你爸爸繳淸欠租，他就連忙跑回和我商量，把去年養的一隻母猪和十多擔蘿匐都弄到鎭上才變了七塊現錢。唔！一隻百來斤的母猪，祇賣了五塊多錢，速吃草料的錢也不够！」母親搖搖頭嘆息着。</p>
<p>「不是麽？自己過年的肉都靠不住了咧！」阿福憤憤地說。</p>
<p>「阿福！這晚還可以到鎭上去麽？」</p>
<p>「做什麼？這晚到鎭去？」母親急促的反問着我說。</p>
<p>「呌阿福拿這四十塊錢去還給伍太爺，好接爸爸回來，今晚不是還要」送灶」？」我從口袋裏捏出四十張花綠的鈔票，送到母親跟前的桌子上放着。</p>
<p>母親和阿福一時都像替父親接着一位救星似的，驚得呆住了半會說不出話來。</p>
<p>「快去罷！和長根一道去，路上小心點。」我從他後面看到他嘴角上還沒收攏的歡笑，免不住的又對他叮囑了一番。</p>
<p>第二天一早就聽見父親在祖堂裏咳嗽的聲響；我忽忽地從房裏走了出來，喊了一聲「爸爸」就再也想不出什麽話說。</p>
<p>父親昨天晚上就聽說我回來了，所以今早見面並不覺得驚詫：他祗用着悠長的喉音，略略哼了一聲應着。</p>
<p>一個中年人的臉上，巳經積起着龍鍾老態似的皺紋；嘴角上兩條肉綫像刀劃過一樣的深刻，橫掛着一綫蒼自得像毛刷子似的枯燥的鬍鬚，不停地急促的喘着。</p>
<p>「伍太爺那裏的事，完了吧？」我說。</p>
<p>他突地停住了正在踱着的脚步，睜着憂慮的眼晴朝我瞥了一下，又滯鈍地提起脚步踱着：「還有什麽不了，四十塊錢送給他了？哼！他們是可以天乾水旱不管，到時候祇要租穀；嘴和他說乾了，想打幾成折扣交租都是不行的。這種人心也未免太狠毒了一點。」</p>
<p>「算了，今年就少種點；伍大爺的田退給他就完了。」</p>
<p>「哼哼！」父親望着我冷然的一笑，接着說：「孩子，你是不懂得這個的。伍太爺的田是退不掉的，我們生成了牛一樣的命運，少不了是供人家踐踏的。這年兒還有什麽說的，祇有望天老爺帮忙，年成好多少幾担穀，我們就是苦苦的日子，祇要過的太平也就好了，唉！一</p>
<p>一個年夜，就在勉强的歡笑聲中溜走了；我在離別了五年的家鄉住了一個月還不到的時間，就感到凄凉的環境壓逼着我沒有再繼續住下去的心情了</p>
<p>一天早晨，我便在家人們苦着臉的歡送聲中，與幾年來不能釋然的家鄉吿別了。阿福替我挑着行李在前面走着，靜靜地，各人心裏都埋着一層苦惱，相互間都沒有話說。一會兒到了碼頭，阿福把行李送到船上安放好了才走了下來，元自痴痴的在岸上立着，等到這隻船將要離碼頭的當兒，我還見到他的臉上堆下一層苦笑的</p>

<h3 id="c207">不由你不管 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>有一個工科學校的學生，他有天都是從早到晚地在研究他的科學，希望着將來作一個頂瓜瓜的電氣工程師，此外的什麼國家大事，世界情形，他都不管。有人在他面前談社會科學的理論或實際的社會問題時，他就覺得討厭，很想說談話的人是在瞎吹牛皮，沒有一點實際的本領。在他看來，只有終日埋頭畫XXY才算是正當工作，只有懂得幾何代數，電氣工程者，才算是有眞正本領的人，其餘的都不足道。因此，他除努力學習他的功課外，什麼都不管，甚至連報紙也不看。這樣下去，他的自信心更是一天一天地增加起來，絕對相信他自己是可以學得實際的本領，作一個頂瓜瓜的電氣工程師的。凡是有人問他：米斯特，你畢業後預備做什麽事情？他就要毫不思索地答道：當然是做電氣工程師！</p>
<p>然而，不幸的事件來了，那便是好好的中國突然鬧了一個農村經濟破產，工商業凋　，那位想當電氣工程師的米斯特在鄉間的土地生　出錢來，他的在城市中的商店也沒有買主　快要關門大吉了，於是他家裏的老頭子給他寫了一封航空快信來，說家庭經　緊迫，以後不能接濟他的學費了。他着了這封信後，好像一顆巨大的炸彈投在他的腦頂上爆炸了似的，他的希望，他的勇氣，乃至於他的生命都被炸得粉碎，他滿腦子的XY都變成了一團一團的火球，在他周圍旋轉，他狂呼亂呌，幾乎快要發瘋了！…</p>
<p>在這段故事中，我們可以看出人生活在現實社會中，現實的一切社會問題都與他有不可分離的關係，不由他不管。那位想作電氣工程師的工科學校的學生雖不管現實的社會問題，只是去埋頭研究他的功課，但現實的社會問題却要來管他。很顯然的，他是不管什麼農村破產與工商業凋敝等政冶經濟的問題的，但農村破產與工商業凋敝却使他的學費發生了根本的問題，使他發狂，成為了瘋人！由此我們可以說，生活於現實社會中的人，無論如何都是不能不管現實社會的一切的。</p>
<p>如果你還不明白，那就憑你的高興，隨意提出一個問題和我來討論吧。你也許會要想到，和尙是已經「看破紅塵」，「遁入空門」，絕不「思凡」了的，現實社會的一切與他們都無關係，因此，他們便可以不管現實社會的一切了。但事實却與你所想像的完全相反，譬如，在上海各大廟宇內的和尙，如果不去聯絡那些紳士，那他們便不能得到安寗，雖然他們不想去管紳士，但紳士却要去管他們；更顯然的，就是國家的法令，如　　以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>保護廟產或沒收廟產等法令，尤其是他們所不得不管的；再說，社會的一般風尙之變化，也與他們有很大的關係，我們知道，在佛敎盛行時期中，各地的廟宇是如何的繁榮，各地的和尙是如何的富足，但自辛亥革命以後，有許多廟宇改成了學校，和尙們也就一天一天地衰落了，現在雖還有廟宇和尙存在，但也沒有從前那麽興盛了。由此可見就是「遁入空門一的和尚也不能不管不實社會的一切。倘若把問題由和尙世界引到「凡人世界」來，那便更加明白了。「一二八」以前的住在閘北的同胞，有許多一定是自以為與國際政治無關係的，因而也是不管國際問題的，但「一二八」事件一爆發，日本的大砲却燬去了他們的房屋和全部財產，不管他們內心是否願意，都不得不去作難民。在申新七廠的幾千工人中，也許有一些是不大留心帝國主義對我們的經濟侵略的，但最近該廠却是在帝國主義的經濟侵略下被匯豐銀行拍賣了，眼見得就有失業的危險。最近自殺的　影明星阮玲玉也許平時並不管社會的道德法律等問題，也許不明白金錢喫人的道理，但在戀愛糾紛發生後，便不由她不管了；道德，法律，與一切舊勢力一齊向她進攻，終於使她無力生存，而實行自殺了。這樣，你還能說生活在現實社會中的人可以不管現實社會的一切嗎？當然不能！因為你不管現實社會的一切，現實社會的一切却要來管你，使你不能不去管現實社會的一切：這在上述許多事實中都可以找到說明。</p>
<p>因為你是生活在現實社會中的，現實社會的經濟政治，法律道德，風俗人情與你的生活都有不可分離的關係，事實上是不由你不管現實社會的一切的，所以，你如果要有計劃有意義的生活，你就非勇敢地去接近現實，理解現實的一切不可。因為必須要理解現實，才能有計劃地去處理現實，不然現實便要把你處理。上述的那位想作電氣工程師的米斯特，為什麼遭到了現實的一個打擊之後就發瘋了呢？那便是因為他抱着「不管一切」（結果是不由仙不管）的觀念，不去接近現實，因而不理解現實的緣故。倘使他平時就很注意中國的一切現實問題，很理解現實的中國社會，那怕就是失學，他也是不會瘋狂的，因為他在理解現實之下便會知道如何去處埋現實，絕不致為現實所處理了。又阮玲玉為什麽自殺了呢？那也是因為她不理解現社會的一切，不知如何去反抗現社會對她的壓迫，從而被現社會殺死了的　故。所以，我們說，不管你是什麽樣的人，不管你是在經商做工或作編輯，你要想有計劃有意義的生活，不是糊裏糊塗地鬼混，你都必須要認眞地去管現實，理解現實，因而作現實的主人，自由處理現實。</p>

<h3 id="c210">一個「文藝額廳」裝的風波 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>—關於「模倣與創造」問題的爭論—</p>
<p>春天，黃昏時候，在一個小小的「文　客廳」（Salons　Literaires—「沙龍」）裏，一個小說家倒在一張沙發上抽烟卷，幽閒地從口　裏吐出大大小小的烟圈來；一位戲劇家在窗戶旁邊一面玩他的手杖，一而遙望着夫空出神：還有兩位詩人都坐在椅子上，架着大腿，低聲地但很得意地讀他們新作成的詩作。客廳裏的空氣是那麽的寂靜。本來，這些作家是特別聚合到這兒來各自誦讀他們的新作，並要互相稱讚和批評的。但是滲加這個「文藝客廳」的還有一位批評家，現在還未到來，所以他們的工作不能馬上就正式開始。不然的話，那我們的詩人，戲劇家和小說家是早已搖頭擺尾地高聲誦讀起他們的佳作豪了。</p>
<p>我們的詩人，戲劇家和小說家本來是要等那位批評家來時誦讀他們的佳作的，不料那位站在窗戶旁邊的戲劇家忽然向其餘的人提出了一個問題。他說：「我們常聽見那些文藝理論家說：藝術是人生與自然的模倣：但也有人說偉大的藝術作品完全是天才或作家閣人創造出來的。這兩者究竟誰對？」</p>
<p>「當然是天才的創造！」兩位詩人齊聲答應着</p>
<p>「笑話！沒有人生與自然，天才作家會創造什麽？」那位小說家站了起來，態度很不客氣。</p>
<p>於是，問題的爭論正式開始了。</p>
<p>詩人甲—請你不要着急！我不想和你來一）講什麽人生和自然，我只問你：世間這樣多的人，為什麽只有少數的天才詩人，天才作家才能創作出偉大的作品呢？你能說那些作品不是他們獨特的天才創造的嗎？還有，明媚的月姐，誰都覺得可愛，但只有天才詩人能將她的可愛處描寫出來，常人却不能够。你能否認天才詩人偉大的創造力嗎？……</p>
<p>詩人乙—就拿人生來說吧（他不待他的同伴說完就搶着說），全世界的人都在生活着，但請問有幾個人是了解人生的？偉大的天才作家的眼光特別銳敏，感情特別豐富，所以惟有他才能深刻地了解人生，惟有他才能在藝術作品中美妙地把人生創造出來！</p>
<p>小說家—你們二位的話大槪說完了吧。但是，對不起，我並不贊同你們的理論！不錯，在全人類中，的確只有少數的天才作家能作出偉大的藝術品，但倘使沒有自然與人生，偉大的天才能憑空創造出偉大的作品嗎？所以，偉大的作品並不是天才憑空的創造，而是他們眞實地模倣人生興自然的結果。藝術楚人生與自然的模倣，因此作家的模倣自然與人生越是眞實，其作出的作品便越是偉大！</p>
<p>詩人甲　乙—怪論！…</p>
<p>戲劇家—　你們不要爭論（他好像為人徘解糾紛似的說）。我是沒有任何成見的。據我看來，你們好像都有理由。。……</p>
<p>這時候，門鈴響了。接着是那位批評家走了進來。</p>
<p>「對不起，諸位久等了！」新來的人說。</p>
<p>「不要客氣！…我們現在疋爭論着一個問題。」小說家說。</p>
<p>「啊！什麽事？」</p>
<p>於是那位自稱沒有成見的戲劇家便爭先地把剛才他們爭論的情形向批評家說了。</p>
<p>那位批評家的態度似乎很沈着，他聽完了戲劇家的話之後，仔細地想了一想才說：一這個問題倒很有趣味。我也想責獻一點意見。……」　　戲劇家—好，你說吧！</p>
<p>批評家—是的，我先說天才的創造的事。的確，如果沒有人生，任何偉大的天才都是不能憑空創造什麽的。（「對呀！」—小說家）我們看，那件偉大的作品不是表現着一定的社會思想與感情的呢？所有的社會詩，社會劇，社會小說，自然是描寫着一定的社會思想與戚情的，就是那些吟風弄月的詩詞，也是一種社會意識的表現。李白孟浩然等歌詠自然的詩，都是表現着那時的一部份人的思想與感情的。倘使在天才所生活的時代社會中沒有存在着某種社會的思想與感情，那他便不能憑空地在他的作品中將那種社會思想與威情創造出來。歌德是天才，但他只能在他的時代作出浪浪主義的詩和小說，却不能寫出新寫實主義的作品；李白杜甫也是天才，但他們在唐代只能作出律詩，却不能寫出些近代式的新詩來：為什麽呢？因為他們所處的時代社會沒有存在着那種思想。如果思想是人類在其生活中形成的，那麽，天才作家的描寫人生，便只能描寫在他的時代社會中所存在的人生，不能在他的作品中憑空地創造出在他的時代社會中所不存在的人生來。所以，與其說偉大的作品全是天才的創造，倒不如說偉大的作品是人生的產物，社會的產物的好。…</p>
<p>詩人甲—又是什麽社會學的觀點來了啊！……</p>
<p>詩人乙—如果偉大的作品是社會的產物，那天才便沒有用處了！</p>
<p>批評家—請你們二位不要吵！等一會兒我還要說藝術的功用和作家對社會的作用問題。現在，我先來談談模倣的說法。說藝術是人生與自然的模倣，這是從亞里士多德那兒來的意見，但也是錯誤的。（「什麽？」—小說家）是錯誤的！如果藝術只是人生與自然的模倣，而且是越是模倣得眞實的作品，便越是偉大，那麼，法庭上的記錄，便是最偉大的文學作品了因為牠是眞實地記載着一種人事，一種人類生活形態的；照相帥攝的人物的照相也是最偉大的繪畫了，因為相片上的人物簡直和牠所照的實在的人物一樣，可謂模倣得最眞實了，但是，不管怎樣，你總不能說法庭的記錄是文學、也不能說照相是繪畫！事實上，每一個作家都有一個複雜的腦袋，都有一定的思想，一定的世界觀，他之描寫人生，並不是照相似的地去模倣，而是通過了他的腦袋他的世界觀去描寫的。所以作家的創作作品，是在描寫反映在他腦袋中的社會生活；一切藝術作品都是社會生活之藝術的反映，不是簡單的模放。</p>
<p>小說家—「反映」，玩弄新名詞！哼哼！……</p>
<p>批評家—問題不是「哼哼」，就可了結的，我們需要用理論來論辯！……現在我還要說作家及其作品對社會的作用問題。偉大的作品是社會的產物，是社會生活的藝術的反映，這是不錯的；但正因為作品是藝術地反映了社會生活，所以牠能使一般讀者看了之後知道其反映的社會生活是什麽；如果某一作品是眞實地反映了社會生活，那我們看了之後便能理解社會生活的眞實性，從而在我們的認識生活中去决定我們的生活態度。這樣一來，藝術作品便有指導生活和帮助生活的作用了，因之作家及其作品雖是社會的產物，但他同時對社會又有反的作用。只有在這反作用上天才作家才能顯示其偉大。</p>
<p>詩人乙—又是什麽　辯法來了啊！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>批評家的話還沒有說完，那兩位詩人和一位小　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　很　　　　　　　　　　　　　　廳」專便只有戲劇家批評　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　也就不能實現了；而且從此以後，那兩位詩人和小說家　　也　　　　　來了，他們是各自去創造自己的「沙龍」。</p>

<h3 id="c215">電影發達的簡史（十四） <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>有聲片造就了許多新明星，但是也毀滅了許多舊明星。伊密爾詹寗斯（EmilJnninga）當時所認為最偉大的一個演員的，却因聲片的盛行，而不能悄然回到德國去了。他雖是生長於紐約的勃洛克林的，但是因為他粗澀的聲音，却不能再在聲片時代立足了。</p>
<p>其餘因聲片盛行而沒落的影星，也不計其數，但其中反覆無常的地方亦很多。有一位女明星呌蓓茜勒芙（Bessie　Love）的她自一九一八年就入影界，資格極老。但她在聲片盛行的數年之前，已經成了一個過去的人物了。那時一般電影演員的末路之一，就是加入百老匯的雜要班，所以蓓茜勒芙亦就不免蹈了前人的慣例。但是自從她加入了雜要之後，她却學到了歌唱，舞蹈，以及彈育古利利。那時剛巧米高梅公司要攝製一張（Broadway　Melody），蓓茜就毛遂自薦的，做了那張鉅製的主角，等到那張片子風行一時之後，蓓茜勒芙的　名，亦就雀噪而起了。</p>
<p>琵琶姐尼兒（Bebe　Daniels）的突然婉轉鶯歌，亦是有聲影片史上的一個奇蹟。她在事先對於她的歌喉，是嚴守秘密，不令人知的。但她辛動的練習着，工作着，等到該片完成，公開試映的第一夜，却使她最親密的朋友，都橋舌不下了。康拉耐格爾（Conrad　Nagel）因為他有舞臺上的經騐，也成了一時之選，太家你爭我奪，使他就是生了四條腿，各公司亦跑不過來。蓓蒂康遜（BettyCompson）自從演過了一張“The　Miracle　Man”之後，已經漸漸沒落，而開始加入短片的攝製了。但是聲片盛行之後，不久又重被發現，而為人爭取了。</p>
<p>茂立斯希佛萊（Maurice　Chevalier）從法國跑了來，和勞倫斯梯拔（Lawreuce　Sebbett）爭起歌舞名星的首席來。華納得到了約翰巴星穆亞，嚴加防範，惟恐被別家公司搶了去。紐約舞臺的明星，為好萊塢的驚人的報酬所　助了，大家都坐了廿世紀特別快車向西去。許多是成功了而久居西方樂士了。許多却　羽而歸，連原有的位置都沒有了。他們却逢人便道好萊塢的壞處，却不知好萊塢自己無好蔥；惟以觀衆們大家的好惡為歸依也。</p>
<p>女明星的美貌，亦不像從前那樣為人惟一重視之點了。女明星從默片時代到聲片時代，歷久不衰的　我們可以推舉瑙瑪希拉（Norma　Shearer）葛萊泰嘉寳（Greta　Garbo）瓊克勞馥（Joan　Crawford）等幾個人。她們都是趁着潮流的先鋒，急起直追而去學習着對白說話的人。果决之心，决定了她們的前途。成功是努力的酬報。</p>
<p>現在又到了聲片的登峯造極的時候了。我們看看最近的名片，如「閨怨」，如「業債」，如「大富之家」，如「一夜風流」，又如現在放映的「塊肉餘生」，我們怎能找出一些破綻來呢？卽如層出不窮的許多歌舞片，它們雖是空虛浮誇，但却是細膩，富麗，完整，在技巧的細處，挑不出一些毛病。因此，我門又不覺憬然知懼起來！</p>
<p>登峯造極之後是什麼？沒落嗎？不錯的，登峯造極就是一個止境。但是電影的藝術，可以說還沒有到有止境的時候。我們時刻需求新奇的東西。我們將來所有的是什麼？我們已經不能再討論下去了，因為這一裏講的是故事，是歷史，不是歌言也。</p>
<p>一半是工藝，一半是藝術但却是做戲給人看，根據了人的天性，而博得大衆的歡娛或悲歎。電影的歷史却是世上最富有羅曼斯的故事了。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c216">評「賣野人頭」 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>The　Mighty　Barnum</p>
<p>——大光明——</p>
<p>有些影片是完全在營業上打算，我們不能在其中找着一點有關的東西。「賣野人頭」便是這類的作品，我們簡直在其中不能找着主題。假使說這是譏諷商人市儈之流，然而事實上這裏的市儈彭納和華而虛二人，乃是使觀衆同情了的。反之，並沒有　刺的意味，那末這一影片的製作動機又在什麽地方呢？</p>
<p>是的，這一影片在營業上也許是很好的吧？譬如說這裏不僅是在女人臉上裝起鬍鬚，小孩兒扮矮人，假裝美人魚，還有長人和胖女人，都使人們像在遊戲塲中一樣，頗可引起人們好奇的快感，雖然人們也都知道那些，都是假的扮裝。</p>
<p>這裏正是賣野人頭似的在華勒斯皮萊和亞道夫孟郁的號召力上打算。就他們二人來說，在這裏確有着可愛的個性，特別是華勒斯皮萊扮裝了彭納，背着老婆收集奇怪人物的種種，更使觀衆們不斷的哈哈大笑。是的世界上確有這種個性的人，他們想盡方法作發財的打算，他們以賣野人頭當作正當的職業，他們從流浪漢變為紳士，然而在眞的紳士們面前，却又不免要鬧着種種笑話的。然而彭納到底是有良心有情感的人，當他妻女離去，心愛的歌女也絕裾而去，而營業又遭慘敗的時候，他那失收的痛苦，確是很有情感的表現。</p>
<p>然而整個的說來，這一影片的內容固然空虛，而在形式上也並不是何等極有成就的表現。編劇或導演，充其量的祇能說是盡職，卽如以字幕來解釋劇情，便是聲片發達期中少有的事。又如彭納大宴賓客的鬧笑話，一次又一次的未免太多，而且在客人走了之後，還要來上兩次，簡直破壞了悲哀的空氣，於此可知導演的手法，並不怎樣高明，而且是庸俗的表現。</p>
<p>當然，我們並不說這一影片毫無興趣，前面巳經說過，在生意眼上，頗有賣座的把握。至於後來的高潮，大火燒，和野獸奔突，都很緊張。但是在火的包圍之中，導演却容許彭納和睡在棺材裏的華而虛從容的講話，這種念頭，未免太不近情理了。</p>
<p>主演者華勒斯皮萊，在「自由萬歲」中的演技，給與人們最高的讚嘆。但在這一影片中除了一貫的使人發笑之外，却沒有特出的表演。假使人們希望能看到如「自由萬歲」那樣精采的演技，那恐怕是難以如願吧！</p>
<h3 id="c217">「漫游獸國記」雜話 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>“Baboona”—新光映</p>
<p>在流行的　片中形成着三個分野，一種是如『獸異」，一龍虎鬥」等　養馴了的獸類來演做的；一種是「人猿泰山」型的用人和　獸共同表現的；而第三種如「馴獸記」的前半部和這一」漫游獸國記」，是純以荒野林谷中的獸類活動作主體的。</p>
<p>「漫游獸國記」正和一馴獸記樣的沒有情節。祇前面寫飛機起行，由積雪的康雅山峯的奇險，而到菲洲；再從土入生活，歌舞等畫面？說明到了內地：於是接觸觸獅子，犀牛與象等的部分生活，尤以狗面猿的介紹作為全片重要的部分。</p>
<p>嚴格地說來，這祇能視為探險新聞片，若認作紀錄片不免是過高的估價吧。因為在作者馬丁約翰生夫婦的攝影機下，雖然忠實而且比較詳細地紀錄了狗面猿之類的日常生活狀態，哺育與敎養小獸的情形，以及為生存而鬥爭，如抵抗惡豹等。但這紀錄對於科學研究之分析與系統固然是不够的，而關於獅，象，犀牛等的介紹也是只部分的，片斷的。</p>
<p>至於個別的畫面，有着頗為美麗的鏡頭，而在許多生動與逼眞的地方也顯着作者的努力與忠實。但從全片的整體看來，却太缺乏Montage的手法，不但無關緊要的飛機畫面太長，太多，而獸類生活的攝取一般地也太呆滯。至於調察的弛慢，也加强了沉悶的宗氣與情緒。</p>
<p>比較地說攝影技術，却有相當的成就，而這部片子不趨於低級趣味，也是較為可取的優點。</p>

<p>雪倫瞪著眼睛說道勃郎却先生，你為什麽不去編輯小小小報呢？那你不就可以在報上登它，個第位穿著游泳衣登台表演的提琴家，還用得著什麼音樂談評呢？傑姆聽了獪的笑道：「嗄，我祗才知道女士是一位知識階級的人。」　倫道：「不管知識　級不知識階級，難道你忘記了自巳的事業了嗎？」傑姆道：「那末我要先請問你，你的事業是什麽？」雪倫將肩膀聳了一聳道：「哦……這幾個月之內，先寫些高尙的音樂談　。這張報紙從來沒有登載過什麼好談評。然後我還要試試雜誌，或者自已編輯一種兩種……</p>
<p>她語氣的肯定，使傑姆勃郎　駭怪起來了，並且使他生氣起來了。他咳了一聲，提高了喉嚨說道：「為成全女士更高尚的事業起見，鄙人不敢留你在此，一則不願意你將你的寶貴的光陰，銷　在區區敝報上，二則免得阻碍到你可上的前程。」雪倫連忙說道：「我是不悄什麼阻碍的。」傑姆道：「但我對於你的前程太關切了，所以我今天要傲件好事。請你到下面去，去見賬房先生，叫他給你兩個禮拜的薪水，就說你被開除了。</p>
<p>雪倫站著說不出話來。她眼請睜得大大的，不信這個人竟將她開除了。旦是一回　　回復了原狀。她站了起來說道：「按照你那欣賞音樂的能力，總有一天你會在你的報上，登著一個游泳女子的照片，坐在一個大喇叭的旁邊的。這不是你的讀者所喜歡看的嗎？」傑姆聽了，却不生氣，祗頻頻點頭道：「這個生意眞好，，你見了賬房先生，叫他另外給你五塊錢獎賞金。這個意思太妙了。再會吧……」雪倫亦說了一聲：「再會」就悻悻然走了出去。</p>
<p>那天晚上是「歌壇雙絕」開幕的第一夜。傑姆士勃郎却亦雜在在衆之中，旦是也到了第二次閉幕休息的時候才到的。他每次看戲，從來沒　從頭看過，但他亦不在乎，因為醉之意本不在酒也。這時夫人小姐們那袒胸露　的，穿著華麗的晚服，男子　穿著晚餐禮服。在那休息時間，大家在廣廳裏，熙　往來。傑姆士站在人叢當中，心想　麽一個　所，這許多人聚在一處，一定定有極好的新聞的料的，要在有人能尋戈而已。</p>
<p>果然他念頭沒有轉完，他巳經看見對面有四個並肩行走著。柏德森和他的夫人，彭尼斯德，還有一個就是雪倫那各脫。他看見了他們，一　　就不由自主的走了過去。他現在不是戲劇的看客，而是一位活潑發的新聞記者了。他自己記住會發折言要尋出柏德森案子的究竟，就不敢怠慢起來。</p>
<p>他招呼著那銀行鉅子，和他的夫人。他眼睛不由得兩次三番地，瞟著那旁邊的美男子頭髮梳得光光的，蒼蠅都憇不上的。他說道：「哈　，彭尼斯德，還是從前搖船競賽的時候看見的呢。」他又轉到雪倫身上說道：「密司那各脫，久不見了，自從……」他獰笑著。雪倫接著道：自從今天早晨，你將我開除了。」他頭抬得高高的，依在彭尼斯德的身上，呌他　香烟。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanchang) A grand meeting held by various circles in Jiangxi Province to commemorate deceased soldiers who died suppressing bandits and loyal martyrs was held at the Nanchang Lizi Society on the 6th at 8 AM. The venue was solemnly and respectfully decorated. Eulogies and elegies from central government officials were displayed in the memorial hall, while thousands of elegiac couplets from various places were hung outside the hall, appearing entirely white from a distance. During the meeting, Cheng Tianfang, the central government representative, and fifteen others were elected as the chief sacrificial group, with Yu Baiqing as the chairman of the meeting. Over a thousand representatives from various provinces, cities, troops, organizations, and groups attended. After the meeting began as scheduled, a public memorial ceremony immediately commenced. Cheng Tianfang represented the central government, Xiong Shihui represented Chairman Lin, Gu Zhutong represented Chairman Jiang, and Gong Xuesui represented President Wang, followed by representatives from the province's party, government, and military, who offered public sacrifices successively. The ceremony concluded at 9:30 AM. In the afternoon, public sacrifices were offered by various provinces, cities, organizations, and groups, which lasted until dusk. The provincial capital and various cities and counties lowered flags on the 6th. Plain lanterns and white decorations were hung at the entrances of shops, and entertainment and banquets were suspended. At 11:00 AM, all citizens stood in silence for three minutes to express their condolences. The railway station, bus station, and major streets were decorated with plain colorful arches. Police and boy scouts were fully mobilized to maintain order around the venue and streets, strictly enforcing the rules of the New Life Movement, highlighting a spirit of order and solemnity. According to the chairman's report, Jiangxi Province was plagued by bandits for eight years, with approximately 20,000 soldiers killed in action and over 80,000 loyal martyrs who died in service. Fortunately, Chairman Jiang personally supervised the suppression of bandits from Yunnan and Jiangxi, finally pacifying the bandits in Jiangxi and rescuing the people from hardship. The martyred heroes bravely sacrificed themselves for the nation and the people. Therefore, holding a memorial meeting to mourn the nation is of great significance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The meeting to suppress bandits was held on the morning of the 6th, which, coinciding with the National Tomb Sweeping Day, added to the solemnity. During the meeting, the Film Division of the Central Propaganda Department filmed the event. Airplanes soared overhead, scattering propaganda leaflets. As representatives left the venue, they also distributed historical materials about the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi and special publications from the meeting for commemoration. Gu Zhutong scheduled a luncheon for the sacrificial representatives on the 7th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) After the Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi reinforcement troops arrived in Guizhou Province, they joined the battlefield to attack the communist bandits in northern Guizhou. This is the largest battle in China in recent years. Seeing that the access to Guiyang was blocked, the communist bandits are now retreating eastward, apparently seeking to join forces with He Long's communist bandits in Hunan. Guiyang is now free from danger. Therefore, foreigners who sought refuge in Anshun will return to the province within a few days. Our troops are now taking advantage of the victory, dividing into three routes to attack the bandits from the rear and encircle and annihilate them. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

Work Together to Build a New Guizhou; Eliminating the People's Suffering Requires First Banning Opium; Secondly, Developing Agriculture and Mining; Chairman Jiang's Instructions at the Welcome Meeting of All Circles in Guizhou <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Guiyang (Late arrival) Chairman Jiang attended the welcome meeting of all circles in Guiyang on the 1st and delivered instructions entitled "How Should Guizhou Implement the Three Principles of the People?" The original words are as follows: Elders, fellow countrymen, and comrades of Guizhou, my visit to Guizhou this time is only for a very short time. I have not had the opportunity to meet and talk with everyone in detail. After the military arrangements are in order, I will invite everyone to meet and talk more often. Today, I am very ashamed to receive such a welcome from the elders and fellow countrymen of all circles. Because for several years, the country has been in a state of internal and external troubles, and we have not been able to fulfill the central government's responsibilities to many places, especially to Guizhou. Therefore, our Guizhou is still the same as it was in the past and cannot make much progress. The central government is truly very sorry. I hope that from now on, the people of Guizhou Province can all strive and work hard under the leadership of the central government, be healthy citizens of the Republic of China, and be true followers of the General to build our new Guizhou and our new nation, and fulfill the revolutionary responsibilities that everyone bears. Regarding how we should relieve the suffering of the people of Guizhou in the future and how we should build a new Guizhou and make it a field for the Three Principles of the People, the central government is very willing to accommodate the opinions of fellow countrymen and comrades from all walks of life as much as possible, and also hopes that fellow countrymen and comrades from all walks of life will contribute more opinions. We know that not only are the people of Guizhou suffering now, but the people in every part of China that I have seen are also suffering. Although there are many reasons for the suffering, the biggest ones are no more than two: one is the impact of bad military and political influences, and the other is that the general public lacks knowledge, self-cultivation, and strength, and does not know how to invigorate and save themselves. Therefore, if we want to relieve the suffering of the people, on the one hand, the central and local governments must do their best to rectify the military and improve politics to relieve the suffering of the people. However, relying solely on a few officials in the government cannot achieve this goal. It is necessary for the general public to be able to awaken, strive, and work together under the guidance of the government to achieve the goal of relieving suffering. Whether they are in the same province or the same place, the comrades of the central government are doing their best to find ways to relieve the suffering of the people and protect the lives and property of the general public so that everyone can live and work in peace and be well-fed and well-clothed. This is the goal of our party and our revolution. One of the purposes of my visit to Guizhou this time is to supervise the suppression of the Red bandits and to protect the people of Guizhou, that is, to protect the production of the people of Guizhou so that everyone can live and work in peace. Step by step, the General's doctrine must be able to achieve this goal. It is necessary for all the fellow countrymen in Guizhou Province, especially the intellectuals and the backbone of society present today, to be able to jointly support the central government and help the implementation of all the central government's policies in order to fulfill the responsibilities of the people themselves. As long as everyone can work together with one heart and one mind, I believe that the suffering of the people of Guizhou can be completely relieved, and a new Guizhou and a new China can be built very quickly. This is the most sincere expectation of the brothers for all the fellow countrymen and comrades. In addition, there are two important meanings that I would like to take this opportunity to contribute to everyone. First, there are many, many sufferings of the people now. It is impossible to completely relieve them all at once in reality. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the priority and urgency, and find the most painful and worrying things for the people and eliminate them first. I think that the most painful and worrying thing for the people in Sichuan or Guizhou now is opium. Not only are those who smoke opium very painful, but those who grow opium are also painful. It not only harms for a while, but also fundamentally endangers the life of the nation. Therefore, whether we want to save ourselves, save others, save the people, or save the country, we must make a firm determination and resolutely ban opium. Not only is smoking prohibited, but also planting and selling are prohibited. This is the most urgent thing at the moment. It is necessary to be able to handle this matter first, and then we can talk about everything else. I believe that none of you present here will suffer from the pain of smoking, but all of you are intellectuals, the prophets and pioneers in society. You should teach the general public who are later aware or unaware, and especially think of all kinds of ways to help them quit opium, which suffers the most and causes the most harm. If our general public can quit opium, their bodies and minds can become stronger, and all new undertakings can be done with effort, and they can progress day by day. At the same time, all the land that used to grow opium will be changed to grow rice, wheat, cotton, silkworms, so that production can develop, and the people of Guizhou can be well-fed and well-clothed. In short, now we want to save the country, we must first save the people, to save the people, we must first relieve the suffering of the people, and to relieve the suffering of the people, we must first quit opium, which is the most painful and harmful to the people. After this point is achieved, everything else will be easy, because after the people quit opium, they can cheer up, improve their morals, and increase their knowledge and abilities, and they can build a good society and government. Other things such as abolishing harsh taxes, developing industries, and improving education can of course be done one by one. This is the first point that the brothers want to contribute today. Second, people generally say that Guizhou is the poorest province, but I don't believe this. I think that the situation in Guizhou is not particularly poor compared to other provinces. The land is very fertile, and all the places where opium can be grown are the best arable land, which can be converted to grow other agricultural products. There are also very rich mineral deposits underground, whether it is coal, iron, gold, silver, tin, oil, or mercury. These national treasures are very abundant. In the future, as long as the people of the province can use the gold, silver, time, and energy that were consumed in smoking opium in the past to mine minerals and develop industries, I believe that in a few years, Guizhou can become one of the richest provinces in China, and the people of Guizhou can become a model people in China. The ancients said, "Seek more blessings for yourself" and "It is up to people to make things happen." I hope that all the fellow countrymen and comrades in Guizhou can work together to achieve this goal. The meaning that the brothers have contributed to everyone today is roughly these few points. In the future, I hope that everyone can often meet and tell me anything at any time. At the same time, the brothers can also often contribute their ideas to everyone, and discuss and study with each other to achieve the goal of relieving the suffering of the people and building a new Guizhou and a new China. I hope that everyone will work together in this spirit to complete everyone's mission. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In the recent six years, the overseas silver market has been unstable. Prices rise and fall rapidly, changing in an instant. China, being on the silver standard, bears the brunt of these changes. Consequently, the value of our currency fluctuates accordingly, and our economy and society experience periods of both advancement and setback. Recalling the times when gold was expensive and silver was cheap, the people of the nation were filled with anxiety, fearing that cheap silver would result in "pound losses" in finance and excessively high "settlement prices" in trade, causing numerous harms. Therefore, some people called for banning the import of silver, while others called for prohibiting speculation in silver. Observing the recent situation of expensive silver and cheap gold, the people of the nation are once again filled with anxiety, fearing that expensive silver will lead to stagnant exports and increased import surpluses, resulting in only harms and no benefits. Consequently, some call for banning the export of silver, while others call for prohibiting speculative trading. Thus, if the price of silver remains unchanged, it is fine. But if there are drastic changes, whether rising or falling, it will inevitably cause the people of the nation to be filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>According to American telegrams, Senator McCarran of the U.S. Senate has proposed abolishing three clauses of the Silver Purchase Act: (1) nationalization of silver; (2) management or restriction of silver trading; and (3) taxation of 50% on silver surpluses. Although this proposal is opposed by the silver faction and may not pass, it shows that the progress of Roosevelt's silver policy may not be entirely smooth. However, if this proposal were to pass, it would be tantamount to declaring a flaw in Roosevelt's policy, and the world silver market would surely experience another major upheaval. If so, one wave subsides, and another rises, wouldn't this again cause the people of the nation to be filled with anxiety?</p>
<p>China's currency panics along with silver prices, causing economic and social instability. On the surface, it seems that the reason for this is the use of silver as the monetary standard. Therefore, some modern people believe that replacing silver with paper, or replacing silver with gold, or replacing silver with a "capacity standard" would solve the monetary panic of recent years and stabilize China's economy and society. However, if we examine the essence of currency, it is not something that comes with the birth of mankind. Before indirect exchange in the past, there was no such thing as currency. If the system of indirect exchange in human society were to disappear in the future, currency would also disappear with it. In the continuous history of mankind, currency can only exist in indirect exchange societies because it is a medium of exchange, only needed under the indirect exchange system. As for the evolution of monetary materials from ordinary goods (such as the earliest shell money in China) to metals and then to paper money, it is due to the evolution of economic society. Therefore, the evolution of society is the cause, and the change in currency is the effect. If one wants to force social evolution by changing monetary materials, it is tantamount to reversing cause and effect. This is definitely impossible.</p>
<p>Today, China's economy and society are characterized by extremely backward production and unsound distribution. Thus, any external change causes unrest. The rise and fall of silver prices in recent years is one such external change. If we ask whether the rise or fall of silver prices is beneficial or harmful to China's economy, the answer must be that a rise in silver prices is harmful to China, and a fall in silver prices is also harmful to China. From this, it can be seen that changes in silver prices are merely a contributing factor, and the reason why this contributing factor can trigger a crisis of panic lies in the fundamental unsoundness of China's economic organization. It is like a firecracker containing gunpowder, which can explode when lit with a fuse or with a match. The fuse and the match are both contributing factors. If one wants to prevent the firecracker from exploding at all, one must first remove the gunpowder, which is the gene for explosion. There is no better strategy than this. This principle is very clear and needs no further explanation.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, it is clear that currency is merely a product of society, and that changes in currency are premised on the evolution of exchange society. The root cause of the current economic and social stagnation in China does not seem to lie in currency. If the fundamental defects in our national economy today are not eliminated, then even if we replace the current silver standard with gold, paper, or "capacity," it would not be of much help. It may even cause general unease in society due to the change in the monetary system and the fluctuation of currency values. Therefore, when discussing China's monetary system today from the essence of currency, I believe that it is necessary to maintain the unified monetary system that China has already achieved. While maintaining a part of the already unified monetary system, one should seek the independence of the national economy with the fastest and most effective strategies. Then, China's economy and society will naturally gradually move onto the path of evolution. If the economy and society can indeed thrive and move forward along the path of evolution, then there is no need to worry about the monetary system not being able to improve. Therefore, whether China's monetary system can be improved or not, the fundamental key lies not in forcing the reform of monetary materials, nor in whether the proposed U.S. amendment on silver can become a reality, but rather in whether the defects in China's economic society itself can be eliminated. This is something that the people of the nation should clearly understand.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Three-Nation Conference to Open Soon: Italian Premier Drafts Plan; Three-Nation Representatives to First Discuss Procedures in London; Eden Returns to England, Says Crisis Can Be Remedied <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The Stresa Conference of England, France, and Italy is scheduled to open on Thursday. Italian Premier Mussolini today took his private plane to Villa Folli to draft a concrete plan to be proposed at the meeting. It is reported that Mussolini wants the three nations to discuss a practical action plan, the main purpose of which is to consider the overall situation caused by Germany's rearmament. Italy's view is that the main difficulty at present is to comply with Germany's demands on armaments while preventing Germany from encroaching on Austria's independence. Italy was greatly alarmed after Germany announced the reintroduction of compulsory military service and recently ordered the recall of reserve soldiers from 1912 for readiness. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Premier Mussolini today piloted a three-engine plane, flying over the Apennine Mountains at an altitude of 6,000 meters, and landed safely at the Folli airfield. He then drove to his villa in Comminate. Mussolini often goes to his former residence near Folli for a few days of rest before state affairs meetings. This time it is in preparation for the Stresa Conference. The Stresa conference venue is being arranged. Hundreds of gendarmes and craftsmen are currently busy cleaning the Palazzo Borromeo on Isola Bella. Mussolini will reside in the Napoleon Room or the Empress Josephine Room when attending the conference. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of England, France, and Italy will hold talks here on the procedures for the Stresa Conference on April 11. They will probably first discuss the British report on the results of Simon's visit to Germany and Eden's visit to Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Whether the names of the British representatives participating in the Stresa Conference will be announced in the House of Commons on Monday has not yet been decided by British Prime Minister MacDonald. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Eden Returns to England and Makes a Statement</p>
<p>(London) Eden arrived at Victoria Station at 8:43 tonight, looking very tired. His wife and Foreign Secretary Simon were at the station to greet him. Eden told reporters that his trip to five capitals, including Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague, was overwhelming but beneficial. The difficulties of the European situation are indeed great, but they are not irremediable. If these difficulties are to be overcome, then all countries must fulfill their due obligations. Britain will pursue its sincere, resolute, and courageous foreign policy and support the League of Nations and collective peace. The opinions of the governments he heard during his talks with the authorities in the five capitals are now being carefully studied by the relevant departments of the British government.</p>
<p>Eden and Simon will attend a cabinet meeting on Monday to submit a report. Simon will then address the House of Commons the following day. The general public is now eagerly awaiting this because Simon and Eden will be traveling to Italy to participate in the Stresa Conference on Tuesday. The conference is scheduled to open on April 11. After the conference, Simon and Eden will travel to Geneva because the League of Nations Council has scheduled a special meeting for April 15 to consider Germany's rearmament. Whether Prime Minister MacDonald will accompany Simon and Eden to Stresa is not yet known. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Key Points of the Three-Nation Conference Agenda</p>
<p>(London) The British Foreign Office today received the agenda for the upcoming Stresa Conference from Italian Premier Mussolini, which contains the following four points: (1) England, France, and Italy will decide on a common policy regarding Germany's rearmament; (2) They will decide on a common strategy for the three nations when the League of Nations Council meets; (3) They will discuss Austria's independence and plan to protect Austria's integrity; and (4) They will study the possibility of revising the peace treaties of Hungary, Austria, and Bulgaria. The Italian Premier also expressed a strong desire to conclude an air force mutual assistance pact with France and England. France and Italy will firmly oppose a German-Austrian alliance, and Britain also holds the same view. British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Premier Flandin, and Italian Premier Mussolini will represent their respective governments at the Stresa Conference. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden will also attend. Austria has already indicated that it will send one representative to participate in the conference. The Schuschnigg government plans to request that the existing army of 30,000 be doubled and that conscription be restored. The Austrian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walden are now very friendly to France and oppose the policies of German leader Hitler. However, it is reported that Austrian public opinion tends toward a German-Austrian alliance. If the current government concludes an alliance with other countries, it will not be able to maintain its position. Mussolini denied the rumor that Germany would participate in the conference but did not comment on whether the Nazi government should be invited to participate. The Italian newspaper "Forum" recently suggested that if an understanding with Germany is desired, England, France, and Italy must first establish an agreement to exclude Germany. Diplomatic circles believe that Italian Premier Mussolini will act on this suggestion and genuinely join hands with England and France to oppose Germany's rearmament. The British government is still studying the memorandum submitted by Germany during Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin. It is reported that Hitler made several suggestions in the memorandum, such as (1) concluding an international convention prohibiting economic and financial assistance to any aggressor; (2) a ten-year truce; and (3) signing a treaty similar to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Officials claim that using this plan to replace the Eastern European Security Pact is like going backward. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Guaranteeing Austria's Independence</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval will submit a memorandum at the Stresa Conference explaining the reasons why the French government is appealing to the League of Nations Council against Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles by reintroducing compulsory military service. The League of Nations Council has scheduled a meeting for April 16 to discuss the resolution on Germany's rearmament. Laval will then submit a draft resolution. Paris now hopes that England, France, and Italy will jointly submit this proposal. It is reported that the Italian government recently inquired about the following matters: (1) the opinions of the French and British governments regarding the future meeting of the League of Nations Council; (2) the organization of collective security; and (3) the maintenance of Austria's independence. It is now believed that the rearmament of small European countries has also been mentioned. Paris, like Rome, is now paying close attention to the issue of guaranteeing Austria's independence. However, it believes that the military clauses of the revised treaties between the Allied Powers and Austria and Hungary must first be agreed upon by the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia). It is reported that the French government plans to propose a Europe-wide plan based on the hope of obtaining the agreement of England, Italy, Germany, and Russia. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Secretary of War Declares Peaceful Aspirations</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of War Lord Hailsham recently issued a statement, pointing out Britain's desire to maintain peace and expressing deep concern that Britain's national power is too weak to suit the current international situation. Hailsham said that no one in continental Europe fears Britain's armaments, nor does anyone believe that Britain's armaments are a threat to peace. On the contrary, Britain's military installations are specifically designed to safeguard peace. He then mentioned the visits of Simon, Eden, and others to Germany, Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, saying that no country other than Britain could make such a trip and succeed. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>To Be Discussed at Next Week's Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of State met this morning and approved the resolution of yesterday's Supreme National Defense Committee, stipulating that the recruits who were to be discharged on April 13 this year should continue to stay in camp for training for at least three months. The Council of State then decided to hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting next Tuesday to review the issues to be raised at the Stresa Conference and the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council. Finally, Commerce Minister Marchandeau explained the Franco-Belgian commercial agreement concluded yesterday in the Belgian capital, which was approved by the Council of State. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Observe Britain's Softening Stance</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here all want to understand what attitude Britain will take at the Stresa Conference. Italy's attitude is quite consistent with France's and is already very clear. French newspapers hope that Britain will also adopt the same clear attitude as Italy. "Le Petit Parisien" said, "Italian Premier Mussolini firmly advocates that the Stresa Conference should achieve positive results. Compared to Britain's efforts to advocate limiting the purpose of the conference to merely exchanging opinions, this advocacy of the Italian Premier is especially commendable. As for the softening of Britain's attitude, if we explore the reason, it is actually due to its domestic political situation, not the result of inquiries in Berlin." "Paris Echo" said that a solution aimed at establishing a new European convention is actually a self-deceiving trick, which is only enough to expose the weakness and incompetence of various countries. The great powers cannot effectively resist Germany, so they are using this to cover up. "White Paper" pointed out that the opinions of England and Italy are diametrically opposed, saying, "Italy's position is clear and definite and does not need to be repeated, and there is no need to doubt where we should go." "Le Petit Journal" said, "Although direct consultations between England, France, and Italy on April 11 are necessary, it would be too arbitrary to say that England, France, and Italy must reach an agreement immediately."

<p>British Newspapers Comment on European Peace</p>
<p>(London) "The Daily Telegraph" commented on the statement issued by Lord Privy Seal Eden, saying that the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The European situation is indeed very tense, but a serious conflict will not occur as quickly as generally expected; (2) Poland's opposition to the collective security system is not impossible to overcome, and Germany's attitude may not remain so rigid; (3) The countries visited have no aggressive ambitions and are willing to organize peace institutions; (4) Britain's policy is based on organizing peace institutions. If it can continue to implement a sincere, strong, and courageous policy, it will surely help Europe achieve its peace goals. "The News Chronicle" stated that Eden's trip could have the following diplomatic effects: (1) Various countries have greater trust in Eden; (2) Public confidence in regional conventions has greatly decreased. Germany and Poland do not believe that the Eastern European Pact is beneficial. This plan has now died. As for the Danube Pact, which maintains Austria's independence, it is on its deathbed because German Premier Hitler insists that the Austrian people should have the right to clearly express their will regarding their future destiny (referring to holding a referendum). In addition, the Locarno Treaty, although still in existence, produces a very small sense of security because France and Germany have close relations with Eastern European countries. Once a war breaks out in Eastern Europe, these countries will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. In short, European countries must quickly choose between a collective security system and a chaotic situation. Therefore, the international talks in the coming half-month are of great importance to peace and war. Since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, there has been no impact as great as this.

<p>Brussels A delegation from the French Ministry of Commerce previously came here to study the impact of the devaluation of the Belgian currency on Franco-Belgian trade. An agreement has now been drafted, stipulating that goods imported from Belgium into France will maintain the same prices as the world market, and France will abandon its plan to increase special surtaxes on these goods. Belgian officials and business circles were greatly relieved to hear this news, because they were deeply afraid that the protective tariffs adopted by France would render Belgium's devaluation plan useless. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Premier Flandin told the French trade union today that there is little hope of immediately stopping the international currency war, but the convening of an international conference has already been launched. However, the opposition of other countries has greatly undermined the hope of currency stability. The French Premier reiterated that France will maintain the gold standard regardless of the actions of other countries, but international currency stability is greatly beneficial to all countries. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgian Capital After talks between Belgian Premier Zeeland and French Commerce Minister Marchandeau, the following communiqué was issued: "The French and Belgian cabinet members conducted talks in an atmosphere of sincerity and mutual trust. The cabinet members of the two countries believe that the changes in the monetary systems of Belgium and Luxembourg will lower prices and affect trade between the three countries. Efforts should now be made to avoid these effects. This is the common view of France and Belgium. For this reason, the cabinet members of the two countries have drafted an agreement that will be sent to the governments of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg tomorrow for joint approval."

<p>(London) In the London foreign exchange market today, the Dutch and Swiss currencies were sold off in large quantities, and British pounds were purchased, leading to an increase in the pound's value. Although the rumor from Paris that the Netherlands refused to sell gold was denied, the sale of the Dutch currency continued unabated. People in Paris believe that the Netherlands has now abandoned the gold standard in real terms because the value of the Dutch currency is far below the gold export point. They also believe that the British authorities' failure to use their equalization fund to prevent the rise of the British pound shows that the British authorities are confident that both the Netherlands and Switzerland will soon abandon the gold standard. According to reliable sources in Amsterdam, the anxiety about the devaluation of the Dutch currency is completely unfounded. There is no reason for the panic in Paris that the Dutch bank is not selling gold. The Netherlands has not refused to ship gold to France. The Dutch bank usually does not release gold in the afternoon and will still have to release it the next morning. It is expected that the Dutch bank's interest rate will increase by one percent tonight in order to prevent attacks by speculative investors. It is estimated that the Dutch bank lost a total of 4,000 gold florins worth of gold to the United States and France today. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>The Hague, Dutch Capital This afternoon, speculators continued to attack the Dutch currency. It is now reported that the Dutch National Bank will raise the discount rate to 4.5 percent tonight in order to resist the attacks. According to some estimates, the Dutch National Bank's gold reserves have shipped 40 million guilders abroad today. The Dutch National Bank once suspended the release of cash this afternoon, which caused various rumors. In fact, this is a common practice. According to responsible sources in the National Bank, the National Bank's policy on the gold standard issue has not changed. The rumors of currency devaluation are completely unfounded.

<p>Election Forecast (Geneva) The Free City of Danzig will hold elections for new parliamentary members tomorrow. All parties related to the League of Nations expect the National Socialist Party to win 80% of the vote. The National Socialist Party must obtain a two-thirds majority to petition the League of Nations to amend the city's constitution. The matter is almost predetermined. If the National Socialist Party does obtain a majority, the Senate will attempt to amend the constitution, but doing so without the League of Nations' consent would be illegal, and the League is unlikely to agree. This is the opinion of well-informed sources. Should this situation arise, Germany will not be prepared to resist the League of Nations with a fait accompli. According to the Danzig constitution, the parliament has 72 members, elected every four years. There is also a Senate, with a president, vice-president, and ten senators. The Senate is the highest state authority, elected by the parliament for an indefinite term. The parliament can amend the constitution by a two-thirds majority, provided that at least two-thirds of the members are present. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Polish Indignation Warsaw Polish political circles are greatly indignant about the National Socialist Party's election campaign in Danzig. Prussian Prime Minister General Göring recently stated in a speech to the public in Danzig that Danzig is German. This reveals the "annexationist aim." The Polish Deputy Foreign Minister stated in a speech today that as long as the Vistula River flows as it does today, Danzig will never change.</p>
<p>Free City of Danzig Hitler's representative, Hess, delivered a speech at a rally in Zappot today, praising the National Socialist Party and urging the public to participate in Sunday's election. Hess made a lengthy statement on the international political situation, saying that the Berlin authorities were very angry about the death sentences and imprisonment of German nationals in Memel. Although British lawyers had argued against it, they had not been able to secure their release. Hess also said that Germany's continued tolerance of this matter proves Germany's efforts for peace, which would probably not be the case for Britain, France, and Italy. Germany is deeply concerned that intervention would disrupt the peace of Europe. It is up to the powerful countries who claim to guarantee the region to correct this. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The Free City of Danzig will hold elections on April 7. Prussian Governor Göring went to Danzig to attend the National Socialist Party's election conference and delivered a speech, stating, "Germany is determined not to retake the Free City of Danzig by force. However, it is very clear that the people of Danzig are leaning towards Germany, so Danzig will sooner or later be merged into Germany." Göring also said, "Germany is prepared to join hands with its neighbor France. If France genuinely desires peace, then Foreign Minister Laval need not travel all the way to Moscow. Wouldn't it be better to change course and visit Berlin?" Finally, he hoped that the people of Danzig would fulfill their civic duty this Sunday by voting for the National Socialist Party, because supporting the National Socialist Party means supporting Germany. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the current situation in Memel and Danzig, saying that the German National Socialist Party is being humiliated by others in the Memel region, but wants to humiliate others in Danzig. The greatest difficulty Lithuania has in maintaining relations with Germany is the issue of Memel's autonomy, which Lithuania is not happy to hear. If Germany's radio propaganda to overseas Chinese were not so exaggerated, then the Lithuanian government's punishment of the National Socialist Party members in the Memel region and its assimilation policy would not be so severe.

<p>(Washington) At the Silver Conference convened by the National Silver Industry Federation, Democratic Congressman Dies stated that the United States is now in a position to force the world to adopt bimetallism. The United States should immediately restore silver coinage to raise domestic prices and stabilize global currency. Congressional silver faction members all participated in the meeting. Chairman Allen delivered an opening speech, advocating for greater understanding of silver and its uses, saying that silver is a difficult problem for the United States, but if properly addressed, it could provide jobs for tens of thousands of people and benefit the entire country. Allen advocated increasing the price of silver to $1.29 per ounce. Lynck, legal advisor to the Chinese government, advocated for greater use of silver as a way to solve unemployment and other problems, and advocated for increasing trade between China and the United States based on pure commodity exchange methods.

<h3 id="e30">Female Writer: Sudden Death of Two German Women, Investigation Confirms Suicide, Attempted to Rescue Abducted Reporter <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) London police now believe that the remains of two German women (one, Dr. Fabian, 36, a socialist writer, and the other, the wife of the late German civil servant Wim, also a writer, 56) found in a locked room in a house in London on Thursday died by suicide. Rumors that they were murdered by secret agents of the German government are untrue. The cause of their death was likely due to their anxiety about not receiving renewed permission from the British authorities to reside in London, fearing they would be forced to return to Germany. The two women had recently been in contact with Dr. Weismann to try to rescue German anti-National Socialist journalist Jakobi, who was kidnapped from Switzerland into Germany by National Socialist Party members. Dr. Weismann admitted to being involved in the kidnapping, which caused friction between Switzerland and Germany. The British House of Commons paid close attention to the unexplained deaths of the two German women, and a member of parliament questioned the matter yesterday. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Two female friends of German journalist Jakobi, who was kidnapped in Switzerland by the German National Socialist Party, lived in an apartment in Bloomsbury, London. One was Dr. Fabian, a German socialist writer, and the other was Mrs. Wim, also a writer. Both died suddenly in their apartment yesterday. The cause is unknown, which caused considerable surprise to the general public. A member of the British House of Commons even raised questions about this matter. The detective team has now found out that the two women did commit suicide, because the period of their residence in Britain was due to expire next month and could not be extended. They were deeply afraid of being oppressed by the National Socialist Party if they returned to Germany, so they committed suicide. According to friends of the two women, a suicide note has been found in their residence, proving that it was suicide. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The police have completed the investigation into the sudden death of the two German women. It is said that when the inquest court opens on April 10, the authorities will present evidence to prove that the death of the two women was caused by despair and suicide, and there was no political relationship.

<p>(Moscow) A Soviet Russian balloon ascended into the stratosphere today, reaching a height of over 24.5 miles, more than doubling the American record. This flight was of great value and contributed greatly to science. The balloon did not have anyone inside, but was equipped with an electrical man that automatically sent various signals about the ascent. Many Soviet scientists received reports of temperature changes as the balloon reached areas beyond human reach in the radio room here. According to these signals, the balloon's speed was 15 miles per hour. The lowest temperature was -76 degrees Celsius when the balloon reached an altitude of 30,000 feet. The balloon reached 130,000 feet, or over 24.5 miles, far exceeding the height of 61,236 feet reached by the American Settle and others in 1933. In recent years, there have been repeated attempts to ascend into the stratosphere, the main purpose of which is to study the guiding trend of cosmic rays. However, the famous atmospheric world aviator Post recently made an attempt to pass through the stratosphere from Los Angeles to New York to test whether the upper atmosphere can be a medium for regular commercial flights.

<p>(Washington) Congressmen intend to maintain the United States' neutral position in the event of a European war and want to stipulate a clear policy by law. Many bills have been proposed, with claims such as (1) Regardless of right or wrong, all warring countries are prohibited from supplying arms or providing loans; (2) The principle of freedom of the seas is abandoned. Any American merchant who trades with warring countries is deemed to be at fault if they encounter obstacles. Also, government offices may refuse to issue passports to Americans who travel to dangerous areas during wartime. Some political figures expressed dissatisfaction with this kind of bill, saying that it goes beyond the scope. If the United States does not distinguish between warring countries and considers maintaining neutrality as its ability, then aggression cannot be prevented, and the invaded country is more likely to fail without support, which is equivalent to punishing peaceful nations and rewarding aggressor nations.

<p>(Tokyo) Go Seinosuke, chairman of the Japan Economic Federation, delivered a speech at noon today at the welcome party for the American delegation, stating that the total amount of Japan-US trade has been gradually increasing in recent years, and its content is not competitive. Therefore, the two countries should avoid implementing measures such as raising tariffs and allocating export volumes that hinder trade. Fortunately, the existing Japan-US Trade Council has much hope for mediating the future of trade between the two countries. Deputy Forbes responded to this, stating that the purpose of our visit to the Far East is to record the facts and report back to our country. We hope that all sectors of the Japanese financial community will assist our research work and provide various useful materials. After inspecting Japan, we will continue to inspect China and the Philippines. Although the increase in Japan-US trade relations depends on the power of the government, the increase in friendly relations between the two countries is a prerequisite. Although there are various rumors in politics and economics between Japan and the United States, I believe that the friendly relations between the two countries will never change.

<p>The Hague In Albania, there is a Greek minority, whose language, religion, and ethnicity are different from the natives. The Albanian government issued a declaration to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations in December 1921, allowing minorities in the country to establish their own religious charity organizations and schools, and to freely use their language and writing. Later, Albania promulgated a law in 1933, nationalizing all schools in the country and prohibiting minorities from running their own schools, which was opposed by the Greek government and submitted to the Hague Permanent Court of International Justice for trial last month. Albania and Greece sent representatives to court to defend their cases. The International Court of Justice has now announced its verdict by a vote of eight to three. The Greek side won the case.

<p>(Berlin) The Lithuanian ambassador to Germany today delivered a protest to German Foreign Minister Neurath, opposing German interference in Lithuanian internal affairs, and said that German newspapers and radio stations are making propaganda unfavorable to Lithuania, which has led to demonstrations at the Lithuanian embassy in Berlin and at various Lithuanian consulates within Germany. Lithuania accused the National Socialist Party in the country of plotting to overthrow the state and return Memel to Germany, and imposed severe penalties, which aroused German resentment. The demonstrations outside the Lithuanian embassy and consulates in Germany therefore occurred.

<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Ya</p>
<p>Gansu Province Water Conservancy Eagerly Awaiting Development</p>
<p>Gansu Province is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, covering a vast area. However, due to the arid plateau and lack of irrigation resources, as far as the eye can see, the land is barren. If prompt remedies are not sought, not only will there be no resources for national construction, but also the more than 5.6 million people of Gansu Province will constantly experience disasters and be greatly diminished. However, the way to remedy this must first be to open up rivers and canals, repair ditches and waterways, so that high-lying fields can be irrigated in time, turning barren land into fertile land, enriching people's livelihoods and easing national finances. Moreover, it will also be beneficial to the future of the Yellow River management. Therefore, when talking about the development of the Northwest, everyone focuses on water conservancy and transportation. Speaking of Gansu Province, water conservancy is even more important than transportation. Because with developed transportation and backward water conservancy, if there are imported goods being dumped and no products can be transported internally, the rural economy of the province will inevitably fall into a more desperate situation. Now I visited the Director of the Construction Department, Mr. Xu Xianshi, who expressed his opinions on the Gansu Province water conservancy plan, which is quite noteworthy. I specially record it as follows, awaiting the central government's assistance in handling it, or investment and development by capitalists from various provinces.</p>
<p>Gansu is located on a plateau with scarce rainfall. The areas that rely on irrigation are the Yellow River basin, which runs across the middle of the province from west to east. Gaolan, Jingyuan, and Yongjing counties are all situated along the river. The remaining tributaries are distributed in the south of the river, including the Daxia River, which reaches Yongjing, Linxia, and Xiahe counties; the Tao River, which reaches Tao Sha, Lintao, Minxian, Linze, Kangle, Ningding, and Zheng counties; the Xiangshui River, which reaches Yuzhong County; the Zuli River, which reaches Huining and Dingxi counties; and the Qingshui River, which reaches Haiyuan and Guyuan counties. In the north of the river, there is the Datong River, which spans the border between Gansu and Qinghai; the Zhuanglang River, which reaches Yongdeng County. In addition, belonging to Longdong, there is the Huan River, which reaches Huanxian, Qingyang, and Heshui counties; the Malian River, which reaches Ningxian and Zhengning counties; the Dahei River, which reaches Zhenyuan County; and the Jing River, which reaches Jingchuan, Lingtai, Pingliang, Huaping, Chongxin, and Huating counties. Belonging to Longnan, there is the Wei River, which reaches Qingshui, Tianshui, Qin'an, Zhuanglang, Longde, Jingning, Gangu, Tongwei, Wushan, Longxi, Weiyuan, and Zhangxian counties; the Mapaoquan River, which reaches Liangdang County; the Hengchuan River, which reaches Huixian County; the Xiniu River, which reaches Chengxian, Lixian, Kangxian, and Xihe counties; and the Bailong River, which reaches Wudu, Wenxian, and Xigu counties. Belonging to the northwest of Long, there is the Dang River, which reaches Dunhuang County; the Shule River, which reaches Anxi and Yumen counties; the Beida River, which reaches Jinta and Jiuquan counties; and the Hei River, which reaches Dingxin, Gaotai, Linze, Zhangye, Minle, and Shandan counties. The Jinchuan Gorge enters Yongchang County, and the Baita River reaches Minqin, Wuwei, and Gulang counties. In general, only Jingtai County relies solely on the snow on Mao Mao Mountain for irrigation, without large ditches for storage. Other areas, such as the Beihu River, Jinchuan Gorge, and Baita River in the northwest, all rely on the snow accumulation in the Helan Mountains and Qishushan Mountains as their only water source. Therefore, they often dry up after winter. The above is the distribution of the main rivers and canals in Gansu Province. Its tributaries are interwoven, and there is the possibility of opening them up everywhere. Therefore, Gansu water conservancy is not worried about the lack of water sources, but about the difficulty of the project. In the past, most of the water conservancy projects were carried out by local gentry and people within their capabilities, with the government providing assistance, opening up canals and ditches, or setting up waterwheels along the river to benefit one party. There is still no overall plan for the whole province. According to the investigation, the most notable achievement among the completed canals that can be used for整理 calculation is in Lintao County, which has opened up twelve canals, irrigating 57,700 mu of land. Next are the thirty-two counties, including Gaolan, which have opened up 213 canals, irrigating more than 2.6 million mu of land. Yongjing and other four counties have installed waterwheels, totaling 254, irrigating more than 50,000 mu of land. In total, the irrigated farmland that has been solved is about 2.71 million mu. Gansu Province is located on a plateau, and any land that can be irrigated with water can become paddy fields. Therefore, although the number of paddy fields in the province has not been fully investigated, those that can be irrigated and are not worried about drought are mostly like this. There are also three canals in Lintao County, two canals in Tao Sha County, and one canal in Yongdeng County that have been discussed but not yet completed. The total cost of the project is estimated to be more than 42,600 yuan, and it can irrigate more than 39,000 mu of land. Currently, it is planned to open the Minsheng, Anchuan, and Puji canals in Lintao County, the Xingu, Dajiachuan, and Guantan gully canals in Gaolan County, the Tao La Yan Gan River Canal in Wuwei County, the West and South Changning rivers canals in Longxi County, the Heimaquan river canal in Jingtai County, the Honggucheng canal in Yongdeng County, the Pingliangchuan canal in Pingliang County, the Jing and Rui canals in Jingchuan County, the guiding Longhe canal in Tianshui County, and the Kushui, Weirong 鈸, and Xinglong canals in Jingning County. The total cost of the project is estimated to be about 2.1 million yuan, and it can irrigate 982,000 mu of land.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two projects planned to be repaired: the Jingyuan Be灣 River project and the Tianshui Wei River dike project, which are estimated to cost more than 198,000 yuan and can silt up more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields. If the above-mentioned projects are completed, the number of paddy fields will not be less than 3.73 million mu, which is less than 2/10 of the total number of paddy fields. According to the survey in 1928, the population of Gansu Province was about 5.68 million, with an average of only 0.6 mu of paddy fields per person. The amount of grain produced per mu, according to the ordinary situation, is about 400 catties, which is just enough to meet the average person's annual food needs. Now the difference is almost half. Once there is a drought year, it is impossible to avoid famine. Therefore, if you want to consolidate Gansu water conservancy, I think the population should be the center, and first seek to have one mu of paddy field per person, as the minimum limit. Not only should the above-mentioned unfinished projects and the proposed projects be carried out as soon as possible, but also more canals should be added or wells should be dug in the plateau to benefit people's livelihood. If the amount of irrigation can reach more than 2 million mu, then even in a drought year, the people of Gansu Province can be free from worry about food. Not only that, but in the future, when immigrants colonize the border, they can also increase the number of paddy fields according to this standard as the standard for implementation. However, currently, increasing the canals for this irrigation of more than 2 million mu, or the distribution of digging wells, according to the local situation, the ratio of the two projects is 3/4 to 1/4. 3/4 should be 1.5 million mu, and irrigation by canals should be adopted. The cost per mu, according to the average labor price of opening canals in the past, is about 2.2 yuan, so the total amount is about 2.3 million yuan. 1/4 should be 500,000 mu, and digging wells for irrigation should be selected. According to the Shaanxi well digging plan, the types of wells can be divided into free-flowing wells and water-drawing wells. The water output of a free-flowing well can supply 45 mu of paddy fields, and a water-drawing well can supply 40 mu of paddy fields. The labor cost of one well is about 100 yuan (50 yuan for wages and food, 40 yuan for equipment and materials, and 10 yuan for miscellaneous expenses). The traffic in Gansu is blocked, and materials are scarce, so the wages per well should be increased by 20% compared with Shaanxi, and each well should cost about 120 yuan. However, free-flowing wells are not easy to dig. Now, if 500,000 mu are all calculated as配凿water-drawing wells, then 12,500 wells will be dug, and the total cost of the project is about 1.5 million yuan. To sum up, the cost of the various projects of adding, planning to dig, and unfinished projects is about 7.14 million yuan, which can increase more than 3 million mu of paddy fields. Each mu can increase the yield of more than 300 catties of main and miscellaneous grains. More than 3 million mu should increase more than 9 million dan. If each dan is calculated at an average of 4 yuan, the annual profit is about 36 million yuan. In addition to the project cost, there is a surplus profit of more than 28 million yuan. After that, the annual income and the increase in land prices are even more immeasurable. However, the people of Gansu are poor and have difficulty with finances, and are unable to undertake this great cause. The great benefits are endless, and we cannot but hope that all sectors will find ways to invest and develop as much as possible.</p>

After Li exchanged greetings with the greeters, he crossed the river by car and went straight back to Mapenggang in Dongshan to rest. He then drove to Meihuacun to visit Chen Jitang, where he met and talked for about an hour before returning to his private residence at Mapenggang. Soon after, Chen Jitang arrived at the residence to return the visit, and Li and Chen again discussed important public affairs for two hours before Chen left at noon.

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: In the areas occupied by bandits, due to the arbitrary killings by the Red Army, conscription, and extraction of laborers, deaths followed one after another, and production decreased. Therefore, in the newly recovered areas, only a small number of remaining elderly and weak people were left. The rest either died or fled. The population has decreased sharply, and there is a severe shortage of young men. There is land but no one to cultivate it, which is the most serious phenomenon. Although there is no way to count the deaths in each bandit area, according to a letter from Yongxin, the population of the area was originally 300,000. Now that the compilation and investigation of each area has been completed, it is less than half of what it used to be. There are also other counties that are less than 1/3 or 1/4, which can be said to be tragic. (2nd)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The newly recovered bandit areas in southern Jiangxi, such as Ruijin, Huichang, Yudu, Dianguo, Ningdu, and Shicheng, have been occupied by bandits for six or seven years, and have been under strict blockade for nearly five or six years. Various drugs such as opium, heroin, and morphine have not flowed in at all, and have long been forbidden. Opium addicts have also been swept away. Shao Hongji, the Administrative Inspector of the area, believed that since drugs had disappeared in the six counties under his jurisdiction, they should no longer be allowed to re-emerge. He specially asked the military headquarters to approve the designation of the area as an absolutely prohibited opium area, strictly prohibiting the trafficking, smoking, transportation, and planting of opium. The provincial government, the Pacification Headquarters, and the 3rd Route Army have now strictly prohibited it in accordance with this plan. Once discovered, they will be severely punished by military law, so as to ensure that drugs are completely isolated from this area. (2nd)</p>

<p>Genlin, son of Xiang Nong Ru Rushan, a thirty-year-old villager from the fifth Tu of the fourteenth Du in Shen Dian Village, Jinshan Township, Mudu, had planted several mu of vegetable seeds in the open space in front of his door. He had also built a grass shed next to the field and stayed there every night to watch over his crops. At 1:30 AM yesterday (the 6th), suddenly twenty to thirty bandits came from the direction of Lion Mountain, all unarmed. They first went to the Stone family’s house to search. They seemed to be quite familiar with the Stone family's situation. Finding Stone absent, having lodged with a neighbor, they scaled the low wall, opened the door, and searched for a long time. Finding nothing, they tied up Genlin tightly and beat him on the head with a club. Genlin fainted from the pain. When he woke up, the bandits forced him to reveal where the silver was hidden. Genlin told them he had no money. The bandits, thinking that Genlin was deliberately concealing the truth, subjected him to cruel torture, causing him to be burned and to pass out again. The bandits then left. Afterwards, Shi Rushan sent Genlin to Dr. Yan Guansong in Mudu for treatment, but his injuries were severe and his life was in great danger.</p>

<p>The arrears of old and new land taxes in this county amount to over one million yuan. Despite repeated strict demands for payment from the provincial authorities and the dispatch of Commissioner Huang Xinlai to urge collection, only over 50,000 yuan has been collected to date. Over 200 grain households have been arrested and pursued for their inability to pay. Commissioner Huang, with the silkworm season approaching, yesterday convened a meeting with tax collection officials. It was decided to make a concerted effort to pursue tax collection before the silkworm season, focusing on large households. At the same time, the heads of various agencies and district and township leaders would be asked to assist. Those grain households who still failed to pay would have their property seized to offset the debt, in order to emphasize the importance of national taxation. Commissioner Huang also strictly forbade tax collection officials from extortion and blackmail.</p>

<p>The weather this spring has been drastically fluctuating. After a period of warm weather last month, it was followed by severe cold and snowfall. This has severely impacted the sprouting mulberry leaves, causing significant damage. Moreover, the total number of spring silkworm eggs in Jiangsu Province this year is over 900,000, raising concerns about a shortage of mulberry leaves for the spring silkworms. Currently, various sericulture farms in Jiangsu Province are actively transporting spring cocoons to Zhejiang Province for sale, and over 200,000 have already been exported. However, to prevent a shortage of eggs within the province, the provincial government has sent officials to Hushu Pass to dissuade merchants from continuing to export to Zhejiang. Upon hearing this news, various sericulture farms in this county believe that if they are not allowed to export, there will be an oversupply in the future. Therefore, they will convene a meeting of fellow sericulturists in the coming days to discuss the pros and cons and seek a solution.</p>

<p>The various trade associations of towns such as Wuyi Weicun and Wangxiacun submitted a petition to the Department of Construction, stating that parking log rafts on the canal obstructs traffic and is prone to causing silting. They requested that raft parking on the canal be prohibited after the completion of the current canal dredging project. The Department of Construction ordered the county government to investigate and handle the matter. County Magistrate Hou considered that the timber industry is a major industry in the county, so he convened a meeting with representatives of the industry at the county government on the afternoon of the 5th. Xu Juxi, Qi Zhenyuan, and others attended and submitted a petition, stating the obligations that the industry had fulfilled for the canal and the reasons that it did not obstruct silting. County Magistrate Hou proposed that regulations be formulated to ensure that raft parking does not obstruct traffic. The representatives agreed to discuss and draft regulations with merchants when they arrived in Changzhou and then submit them for review. The meeting was then adjourned. The County Magistrate plans to submit the timber industry's petition to the next administrative meeting for discussion and then forward it to the Department of Construction for review.</p>

<p>Previously, the Business Tax Bureau of this county, based on the instructions of the Provincial Committee, sent personnel to inspect the account books of various shops. They detained and sent to the county government for punishment the shop assistants of the Zhenda Candle and Charcoal Shop and the Baofeng Yikang Cloth Shop in Duozijie, who refused to submit their account books for inspection. Initially, the merchants were indignant. However, after Chairman Teng of the Chamber of Commerce mediated and repeatedly petitioned the Provincial Committee member Yan, who came to Yangzhou to supervise the inspection, the Provincial Committee proposed three key points, which most merchants accepted. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 5th), the conditions on both sides changed again. The shop assistants detained by the county government have not yet been released on bail. As a result, today, all cloth shops, candle and charcoal shops, and incense shops have gone on strike, posting signs on their doors that read "The Business Tax Bureau uses violence and coercion, arresting shop employees, public anger leads to suspension of business." In addition, they published "A Declaration of Suspension of Business by Merchants Due to the Abuse of Power, Violence, and Arrest of Merchants by Investigators of the Business Tax Bureau." As a result, the case has become serious again. Provincial Committee member Yan Shudong came to Yangzhou from Zhen in the afternoon to resolve the situation. Currently, representatives of various industries are gathered at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce. It is said that the leaders of the various businesses are advocating a peaceful approach, and Provincial Committee member Yan is also not in favor of excessive demands.</p>

<h3 id="e103">President Sun Talks About Dividing Central and Local Authority. The Legislative Yuan Studies the Issue Separately According to Central Regulations. Supports Chairman Chiang's National Economic Construction. <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, together with Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, left Nanjing by night train the night before last at 11:00 PM and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at 7:20 AM yesterday. They immediately returned to their private residences to rest. President Sun received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at around 11:00 AM. He stated that, regarding the issue of dividing central and local authority, the Central Political Council had formulated principles based on six guidelines and submitted them to the National Government, which in turn ordered the Legislative Yuan to formulate regulations separately within the scope of their respective responsibilities. The Legislative Yuan has now assigned them to the relevant committees for separate study according to the principles set by the Central Government. Chairman Chiang's proposal for the National Economic Construction Movement is very meaningful. In my opinion, the government must first raise funds to implement basic projects to promote national economic construction. As for abolishing excessive taxes, this has now been completely achieved. The provision in the Stock Exchange Law to prohibit government officials from engaging in speculative trading is for the benefit of the stock exchange, to prevent the spread of rumors and disruption of the market. I hope that all government officials will be able to perform their duties and abide by the law, and abandon the business of engaging in speculative trading. Chiang Tso-ping, our ambassador to Japan, visited Taiwan this time for inspection purposes and had no other mission.</p>

<h3 id="e106">South Seas Tycoon Suggests Saving South Seas Commerce By Establishing a National Goods Introduction Center to Facilitate Sales. <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Chen Xixian, manager of the South Seas Chinese Trade Company, returned to China from Java and met with He Bingxian, director of the International Trade Bureau, to discuss the development of trade with the Dutch East Indies. Chen also provided a written opinion, which is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The Foundation of Overseas Chinese Economy Is Shaken. The economic situation in the Dutch East Indies has been affected by the global economic downturn in recent years, causing panic. However, due to its political stability and sound fiscal adjustments, it is still a market for international trade. Therefore, Japan is making every effort to operate there. In addition to the Kobe-Java and Taiwan-Java routes, it has also opened a new Hong Kong-Java route. This will inevitably lead to maritime competition with the shipping companies operated by the Dutch, and competition has recently broken out. Although this is unlikely to cause any political changes, free confrontation between merchants of both sides will begin, which will negatively affect commerce. The foundation of the overseas Chinese economy is also being shaken as a result.</p>
<p>The Dutch and Japanese Are Organizing Associations. Due to the above reasons, both the Dutch and Japanese sides are organizing associations to cope with the situation. There is the Japanese Commercial Porcelain Association, and the Dutch East Indies has the Dutch East Indies Commercial Association. Overseas Chinese also have the All Dutch East Indies Chinese Commercial Association. The Chinese Commercial Association was organized in October last year and has been in existence for half a year, but it has not yet achieved any special effectiveness. In addition, there are a small number of national goods companies, which are also difficult to compete with the Japanese and Dutch due to the lack of overseas commercial assistance agencies.</p>
<p>A Commercial Plan to Aid Overseas Chinese. Therefore, in order to aid the economy of overseas Chinese, a Chinese goods introduction center should be established in commercial areas that are thriving and suitable in the South Seas. (1) The purpose is to connect overseas Chinese merchants and domestic factories, establish a direct relationship, and enable the government's foreign economic plans to be implemented. (2) The mission is to contact domestic factories and promote sales on their behalf, and to purchase national goods on behalf of overseas Chinese merchants. (3) The work includes propaganda, introduction, investigation, research, design, national goods exhibitions, and commercial intelligence reports. (4) The organization will be sponsored by the National Trade Bureau, with the assistance of the Shanghai and Java consuls to carry out the work. In this way, our economy in the Dutch East Indies will be revitalized.</p>

<p>Reporters from the Shiye News Agency learned from the business departments and foreign exchange departments of the Central, China, and Communications Banks that the second batch of silver shipped by the Great Britain Company's Lazquhao ship, totaling 2,925,000 yuan, is scheduled to enter the port at 7:00 AM this morning (the 7th) and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It is expected that the China, Communications, and Third Banks will send personnel to be responsible for unloading tomorrow. The third batch of silver shipped by the Narda Lhao ship, totaling 1 million yuan, is scheduled to enter the port at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning (the 8th) and dock at the Qichang Stack Wharf in Pudong. The silver is scheduled to be unloaded the day after tomorrow. At that time, the China, Communications, and Third Banks will also send personnel to deposit it in the vaults of the Bank of China, in the same location as the second batch. Zhou Shulian from the Foreign Exchange English Department of the Communications Bank said that the two batches of bills of lading were sent to the three banks yesterday.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese United News Agency reported that the various properties of the Chinese Eastern Railway in this city have been taken over. However, the Central News Agency reporters learned from various sources that the South Manchurian Railway Office stated that it has not yet taken over the properties. The former Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank has filed an appeal regarding the rights relationship and sought to recover the outstanding debt. Yang Ruinian, the lawyer representing the case, told reporters that the report that the case was not accepted was incorrect. This is not a criminal lawsuit, and there is no such provision. The court should hold a hearing. However, the legal procedures are time-consuming, so there are no developments at present. It is also understood that the South Manchurian Railway Office is currently reviewing the properties and will not take them over if there is no substantial benefit. The number of properties of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Shanghai is not large.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Guo Chuntao Returns from Inspection in Europe. Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon. Will Return to Nanjing to Report After a Short Rest. <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Former official Guo Chuntao was dispatched to Europe and the United States last spring to inspect industries. More than a year has passed. He has visited more than ten countries, including England, France, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. He has now completed his mission and returned to China on the Conte Verde. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The ship docked at the Pudong Wharf at around 4:00 PM. Guo's family and dozens of relatives and friends gathered at the New Customs Wharf at 2:00 PM and took a company launch to greet him. After Guo shook hands with the welcoming party, reporters immediately asked him about the main tasks and feelings of this trip on the launch. He replied as follows: I (Guo himself) was dispatched abroad last year to inspect general industries in Europe. However, due to time constraints, I paid more attention to agriculture and industry. As far as the countries I visited are concerned, in 1934, whether it was production, trade, unemployment, etc., in general, on the surface, there was a trend of improvement. However, in its origin, either due to currency inflation, or due to the development of military industry, and other artificial methods, this is only a temporary stimulus, and it may be difficult to get rid of the crisis of panic. The deepest impression we gained from visiting various European countries is "preparedness for war" and "unemployment." Observing the current situation, it is feared that the Second World War may still break out in Europe. If so, the international position of our country will be even more difficult. Because of the fatigue of the journey, Guo finished speaking and took the launch across the river. It is heard that Guo is temporarily staying at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. He will stay in Shanghai for a day or two to visit relatives and friends and take a short rest before going to Nanjing to report.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Arts Exhibition Preview Opens Tomorrow: President Wang and Others to Visit; Minister Wang Inspects Venue, Highly Satisfied <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai preview exhibition organized by the Preparatory Committee for the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London is now ready and scheduled to open tomorrow (the 8th). Government officials will be invited for inspection this morning (the 7th), and Shanghai gentry, foreign guests, and related parties will be invited this afternoon. President Wang of the Executive Yuan and key figures from the Party and government are expected to attend. British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson and many consular officials will also be present. This preview features a systematic exhibition of ancient and modern Chinese artworks, a pioneering effort in China. Domestic archaeologists, artists, and people from all walks of life are expected to take great interest. A Central News Agency reporter visited the person in charge and toured the venue in detail, and will provide a systematic report to the nation.</p>
<p>Background of the Initiative: The exhibition was originally proposed last year by the British Universities China Committee and British academics, following the precedent of international art exhibitions held in London by Italy, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Iran. They consulted with our ambassador to the UK, Mr. Guo, and sought our consent. The government, recognizing the unique value and status of Chinese art in world cultural history, believed that an international exhibition could deepen Western understanding of Chinese culture and expressed willingness to consider it. After multiple discussions, it was decided to hold the exhibition at the Royal Academy in London's Burlington House, under the joint supervision of the Chinese and British governments and managed by a council composed of Chinese and British individuals. The exhibition is scheduled to run from November this year to March next year, lasting approximately sixteen weeks.</p>
<p>Organization of the Preparatory Committee: Considering the matter important, the Executive Yuan established a preparatory committee in China to oversee the exhibition, which was formed in October last year.</p>
<p>Initiation of the Preview Exhibition: To allow domestic audiences to preview the valuable exhibits, the preparatory committee decided at its second meeting to hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai before the exhibits were sent abroad and another exhibition in Nanjing upon their return, providing Chinese people with the opportunity to see, hear about, study, and reference the artworks. Once the decision was made, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Simultaneously, the former site of the Bank of China on the Shanghai Bund was rented to serve as the office, marking the origin of the preview exhibition.</p>
<p>Months of Preparation: The committee's tasks were quite complex, especially the selection, preservation, transportation, and security of the exhibits. Therefore, the committee established specialized committees for exhibit selection, preservation, and preview exhibition preparation. With the collaborative efforts of various personnel, the preparations were completed in just two to three months.</p>
<p>Categories and Sources: The exhibits collected by the committee are divided into five major categories: 1. Bronzes, 2. Ceramics, 3. Calligraphy and Painting, 4. Miscellaneous Items (including Jade, Carved Lacquer, Cloisonné Enamel, Embroidery, Folding Fans, Ancient Books, Oracle Bones and Stone Tools), and 5. Antiquities from the Academia Sinica. The sources include the National Palace Museum, the Antiquities Exhibition Office of the Ministry of Interior, the Academia Sinica, the National Library of Peiping, Yenching University and Peking University, the Henan Museum, and the provincial libraries of Shandong and Anhui. The majority of the exhibits are selected from the National Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Office. In terms of age, the selected items represent various periods from ancient times to the recent past, each systematically arranged according to its historical development. The standards are extremely strict, with Chinese and five British experts meticulously researching and carefully selecting the items. Items with special characteristics are carefully retained by the preparatory committee to avoid sending them abroad. The selected items are cataloged, photographed, and published for research and reference.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Security Measures: The committee has implemented comprehensive security measures for the exhibits. During the exhibition in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council have provided significant support in terms of protection, fire prevention, and security, including iron fences, iron nets, alarms, and other equipment, as witnessed by reporters. For overseas transportation, round-trip transport will be provided by British warships, with Chinese personnel accompanying the exhibits.</p>
<p>Various Aspects of the Exhibition: The exhibition is scheduled to run from April 8th to April 30th, with closures on Saturday mornings, except for the opening day. Admission tickets are priced at two yuan each. To save costs, most of the staff members are seconded from the National Palace Museum, the Antiquities Exhibition Office, and the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Effort: Ancient Chinese art has been on display at the National Palace Museum in Peiping and the Antiquities Exhibition Office for many years, attracting numerous visitors. However, previous exhibitions were scattered and disorganized, with a mix of fine and ordinary items, making research difficult for archaeologists and artists. Now, experts have carefully selected, organized, and arranged exhibits such as bronzes, ceramics, and calligraphy and painting, systematically presenting them from ancient times to the modern era according to their development sequence. This allows viewers to understand the origins and development of various art forms, which is unprecedented. Shanghai offers a variety of entertainment venues, but none can compare to this exhibition. Some of the exhibits, such as ancient bronzes, famous porcelains, and calligraphy and paintings, have rarely been seen in a lifetime. Due to the original storage of National Palace Museum artifacts in Shanghai, Shanghai residents are fortunate to be among the first to view them, a rare opportunity that makes them more fortunate than people living in any other era or location. It is hoped that this exhibition will cultivate an appreciation for high-quality entertainment and promote a passion for art among Shanghai residents.</p>
<p>Minister Wang Inspects: Minister of Education Wang Shijie, a member of the preparatory committee, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and visited the venue at 2 PM that afternoon, expressing his satisfaction. After hosting a banquet for the preservation committee members and the British Consul yesterday, he revisited the venue for inspection.</p>
<p>Reception Without Ceremony: This morning, 127 invitations were sent to members of the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters. This afternoon, approximately 200 people, including foreign envoys, consular officials, Chinese diplomats, and journalists, will be invited. The reception will not involve any formal ceremony, and the same applies to the public opening tomorrow.</p>
<p>Unexhibited Artifacts: Some of the artifacts being shipped to London for the exhibition have never been displayed, including furniture and stationery used by the Qing Emperor Qianlong. The committee decided not to display these items due to their limited significance.</p>
<p>Rules for Visiting: 1. Visiting hours are from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM. 2. Visitors must present a ticket for admission, valid for one person on the day of issue only. Expired tickets are invalid. 3. Individuals with infectious diseases or under the age of ten are not allowed to enter. 4. Visitors are not allowed to bring items or equipment into the venue.

Therefore, several art experts were selected and formed a specialized committee to be responsible for the selection.

<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: Yesterday afternoon, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited the exhibition. At the entrance of the old site of the Bank of China, a plaque of "London International Exhibition of Chinese Art Shanghai Preview Exhibition" with yellow background and green characters has been hung. On the platform are several pots of verdant potted plants. Entering is a large lounge. Books such as Palace Museum picture albums are distributed throughout the room and are being displayed to be sold at the public exhibition. The chairs in the room are all made of chrome. There are no decorations on the walls, but there are various kinds of trees standing tall and low, sparse and dense. When asked, I learned that it was displayed by artist Situ Qiao. Behind the room, follow the arrow of the road sign and enter the exhibition hall. The displays here are mostly ancient paintings and embroideries, which are hung on specially made double walls by copper pulleys. In order to avoid the weight of the lower end of the painting shaft being difficult to bear, cloth straps are used to hang them up. It can be seen that the experts have put a lot of thought into the display. In addition to ancient paintings on the second floor, there are nearly a hundred steel-framed glass cabinets, in which bronzes, jade, folding fans, cloisonné, porcelain, ancient books, carved red (lacquerware) and the "Archaeological Selection Example" item from the Academia Sinica that arrived the latest are displayed a hundred pieces of ancient objects, such as tortoise shells used for divination during the stock era, and stone tools from ancient times, etc. Each ancient object has a card with categories, names, writers, times, owners, and notes, which are filled in Chinese and English, so that the audience can understand it at a glance. The process of a certain ancient object, and the conference printed a Chinese and English detailed catalog each, the description is detailed, quite enough to be the blue book when appreciating ancient objects.</p>
<p>Wang Cai Visited Yesterday: When the Central News Agency reporter visited the exhibition yesterday, Education Minister Wang Shijie, Academia Sinica President Cai Yuanpei, and four British committee members were also visiting the exhibition and browsed various ancient items for a long time, and the five British committee members praised them very much.</p>

<p>The music bands in this city not only have bizarre costumes, but also the music they play is often inappropriate. Sometimes they play sad music or foreign national anthems at festive banquets, or popular songs and ditties at funerals. It is absurd and ridiculous, causing laughter at home and abroad. The Shanghai Municipal Government has ordered the relevant departments to strictly crack down on them. Although a few professionals have followed the instructions to improve, those who do not know how to study are still often found. Recently, there have been hearses equipped with radios, arbitrarily playing songs along the way, which is even more inappropriate. In addition to the Municipal Government again ordering the competent authorities to crack down on them, it is hoped that the public will understand the general situation and no longer hire such bands and cars, so as to show solemnity and promote morality.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Shouchang Ship Employees of Sanbei Shipping Company Positions are Taken in Yichang Major Conflict Occurred <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The new Shouchang ship of Sanbei Company runs on the Shanghai-Yichang route. Unexpectedly, a major conflict occurred over the seizing of sailors' jobs on the first trip to Yichang. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai stating that the ship will not carry passengers and will return to Shanghai. It has been decided to resolve the conflict in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seizing of Jobs: The Shouchang ship, with a deadweight of 630 tons, was fully loaded with cargo from Shanghai to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and many passengers took it to Yichang. The stewards and tallymen in the middle cabin department of the ship were all hired in Shanghai before departure. On the 5th of this month, when the ship arrived in Yichang, the local Seafarers' Association led a large number of workers to the dock as soon as the ship arrived. As soon as the passengers disembarked, they forcibly seized and moved all the luggage from the original stewards, and did not allow the staff sent by Shanghai to work on the ship, forcing the middle cabin department to hand over their positions. The crew refused, leading to a major conflict.</p>
<p>Failed Mediation: The Yichang Seafarers' Union forcibly sent workers to the Shouchang ship, including 12 middle cabin stewards and 6 tallymen, regardless of the circumstances, and occupied the cabins without authorization. The staff refused to hand over their positions, so a large number of local workers were invited to the ship, completely expelling the stewards and tallymen sent by Shanghai and ordering them to leave the ship immediately. The Yichang Sanbei Company reported to the local Party, military, and political authorities for mediation, but the Yichang Seafarers' Association firmly refused to budge, resulting in no resolution.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Office of the General Captain of the Aviation Association Held Seventh Office Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Office of the General Captain of the Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association held its seventh office meeting at its office at 1:30 PM yesterday to discuss the direction of its work. Attendees included General Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Lu Zhangyan, Song Zheng, Zhou Xin, Gu Shangrui, Li Wenyao, Li Jiming, Xue Baolun, Zhu Shengyang, Chen Shuo, Liu Songtao, Zhou Songhe, and others. Li Dachao presided over the meeting, and Chen Shuo served as the recorder.</p>
<p>The chairman reported that the solicitation teams had made great progress since they began their work. For example, Lu Shoulian, the captain of team 193, had been working very hard on solicitation. Recently, he planned to organize an aviation entertainment conference and compile a commemorative album for the aviation sports entertainment conference. All proceeds would be donated to the aviation nation-saving fund. Judging by this situation, it is certain to exceed our budget. More than ten other team leaders are also proceeding very smoothly, and the solicitation results will definitely exceed our budget. Other teams are also working separately. Field secretaries should do their best to assist the team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members in soliciting donations to achieve this great undertaking.</p>
<p>Regarding fundraising, the method of collecting aviation nation-saving donations from the cargo trucking industry has been approved by the municipal government and notified to both the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus, and will be implemented soon. A meeting was convened with representatives from the restaurant industry on the 3rd of this month, and opinions were exchanged on the principles and methods were revised. It was decided to begin collection on May 1st. The brick and tile industry has approved the collection of 20,000 yuan for the aviation nation-saving donation, which will also begin in May. It is planned to collect aviation nation-saving donations from all public amusement parks. After contacting them, the method will be determined. Direct solicitation of members and fundraising is already underway. The general mobilization of the Boy Scouts to solicit aviation nation-saving donations will take place around May, and the date will be determined after further discussion. It is hoped that the staff of this office will work hard and forge ahead courageously to make the aviation nation-saving cause more and more advanced. In addition, the membership list for the first round of solicitation is being compiled and should be published within this month.</p>
<p>Finally, various implementation plans for soliciting donations were discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan, the captain of team 82, requested that Xu Tongli, Xu Shushen, Zhang Lingfei, Xu Xiaochu, Lu Bingqian, Ge Youren, Zhou Xuexiang, Xu Mojue, Xu Jian, Deng Shuping, and others be added as deputy team leaders of the team. It is said that the office of the general captain has already separately appointed them and issued letters of appointment. Mu Ouchu, the captain of team 62, submitted 1,000 yuan in silver yesterday, which was the result of the first round of solicitation. It is said that the office of the general captain has received and acknowledged it with a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3 id="e116">City Land Bureau Issues Notice to Citizens Urging Exchange of Land Certificates <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The City Land Bureau, in order to facilitate the exchange of certificates and make it easier for the public to understand, has specially prepared a notice to citizens and printed a separate booklet for public reference. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to Citizens Regarding the Land Bureau's Handling of Certificate Exchange (April 1, 1935). To the citizens of this city who hold land certificates but have not yet exchanged them for land ownership certificates: Since its establishment in the 16th year of the Republic, this Land Bureau has felt that there are too many types of land certificates within the city limits. Furthermore, due to the changes of the times and the relationship between transfer and separation, everything recorded on the certificates is completely inconsistent with the actual situation. People holding such certificates will inevitably feel difficulties everywhere. Therefore, this Bureau decided to handle the exchange of certificates after land survey. The purpose is nothing more than to protect the property rights of the people, so that each household's base can have accurate boundaries. Now, it has been seven or eight years. Over the years, more than ninety parcels of land ownership certificates have been announced for development. According to the Bureau's regulations, owners should, within one month after the announcement of the development, submit the old certificates, grain receipts for the past three years, and other title deeds to the Bureau, and fill out a receipt for the exchange of old certificates, in order to receive the topographical map of the household land later. After receiving the map, if it is deemed to be consistent with the actual situation, sign the map and return it to the Bureau. After three months, you can come to pick up the land certificate.</p>
<p>On the people's side, although many people come to the Bureau to apply within the time limit, there are still quite a few who wait and see. For example, in various areas of the South Shanghai District, the land certificates were developed in the 18th year, and even today, many household lands have not been exchanged. For these lands that have not been exchanged for a long time, the Bureau has decided to take them all back under municipal management, set up public land boundary stones, and all income from the land will also be collected by the government. It will not be returned until the owner of the land obtains a land certificate. Because if this is not done, the land certificates in this city will never be unified. Therefore, this Bureau sincerely hopes that all citizens will actively exchange their land certificates.</p>
<p>The reason why some citizens do not come to exchange certificates may be because: (1) the certificate does not match the grain, (2) the certificate does not match the land, (3) the certificate shows less land than there actually is, (4) the certificate belongs to co-owners, (5) the certificate is mortgaged. As for other reasons, it cannot be said that there are none, but most of them and more important ones are none other than the above. In order to take care of the citizens, this Bureau has stipulated corresponding measures for these shortcomings. Citizens are making a big mistake if they do not come to exchange certificates because of these reasons. Now, let's explain these measures:</p>
<p>(1) If the certificate does not match the grain or the land, naturally the certificate cannot be exchanged. However, as long as the Bureau verifies that the land does belong to the citizen, then after obtaining a guarantee from the four neighbors and paying all grain receipts for the past three years, the certificate can be approved.</p>
<p>(2) If the certificate shows less land than there actually is, the extra land is called overflow land. The Bureau has also set standards for handling overflow land. In August of the 23rd year, it was revised again and several methods were set up for citizens to choose from. That is to say, raising the tax rate is only calculated at 60% of the estimated value. The estimated value is originally lower than the market price, and now it is discounted by 60%. May I ask, citizens, shouldn't these obligations still be fulfilled? (After the owners obtain the maps, if they see that there is overflow land that needs to be taxed, they can inquire about the exact amount of the tax increase from the Second Section at any time for proper preparation).</p>
<p>(3) If a certificate is co-owned by several people, they often push each other and are unwilling to contribute, or even fight and snatch, harboring malicious intentions. Therefore, it is repeatedly delayed. In fact, the co-owners may as well send the co-ownership evidence to the Bureau together for verification and report the co-ownership situation. The Bureau can naturally manage it on behalf of them. If you want to divide the land, it is also very easy. The cost is only some measurement fee and certificate fee.</p>
<p>(4) If the certificate is mortgaged, it cannot be redeemed for a while and cannot be exchanged. The mortgagee, because the certificate is someone else's, is inconvenient to overstep. So they connect with each other and there is no way. In this case, both the mortgagor and the mortgagee can come to the Bureau together to exchange. First, make a land design in the name of the mortgagor, and then write clearly on the certificate who is the mortgagee according to the mortgage registration method. This way, both parties are very stable and do not have to be afraid of either party using any fraudulent means.</p>
<p>In areas where land certificates have not been announced for development, the exchange can of course be postponed. However, if things like mortgages, divisions, or sales occur, you should first come to the Bureau to request measurement and exchange of certificates, because the Bureau does not register mortgages of old certificates. Both the mortgagor and the mortgagee will lose a protection. As for division or sale, there must be accurate acreage, and it is especially necessary to go through the Bureau's measurement and division first. The procedures for this type of request for measurement and exchange of certificates are also very simple. There is no need to submit a formal document, just check all the certificates and send them to the Fourth Section of the Bureau and fill out a receipt for the recovery of the old certificate (if you are anxious to sell it, he can use this receipt to make a contract first), and then, with the receipt, pay the measurement fee and the land protection fee to the Third Section, and a date can be set for measurement. After the measurement, a draft map of the request for measurement will be drawn, and the owner will be notified to come and see it. After the owner signs and returns it, a land certificate can be issued in three months. If there is overflow land, public harbors, and road land included in the tax increase, you only need to pay the tax increase fee and you can get the land certificate in three months.</p>
<p>Now, the parcels of land certificates that have been announced for development are listed below by region. I hope that citizens who have land in these areas will quickly follow the procedures and come to the Bureau to exchange their land certificates. Don't delay any longer and blame yourselves for not acting in time.

<h3 id="e120">Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee Continues to Support Rural Relief Work <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee on Renji Road has always paid close attention to rural relief work. Last spring, the committee and the Ningbo Agricultural Relief Association jointly established the Ningbo Fangshan District Agricultural Improvement Cooperative, with a total of 132 cooperatives and 132 villages, serving 1,722 households. A total of more than 34,000 yuan was loaned out. Farmers received such economic assistance, their farms were enriched, and all were grateful. Considering the severe drought last year and the even worse spring famine this year, the committee decided to continue to lend the loans due last spring to agricultural improvement cooperatives near the capital to provide relief, which is a great boon for the rural areas.</p>
<p>According to Ling Daoyang, the chairman of the Ningbo Agricultural Relief Association, which cooperates with the committee, the use and distribution of the funds loaned out by the association last year are recorded as follows: 18,966 yuan for the purchase of cattle, 3,846 yuan for seeds and seedlings, 3,247 yuan for agricultural implements, 2,530 yuan for pig raising, 2,176 yuan for fertilizer, 1,506 yuan for fish farming, 1,275 yuan for agricultural product manufacturing, and 456 yuan for other expenses, totaling 34,002 yuan. He also said that because farmers will soon begin planting this spring, the most important thing is the lack of seeds. In addition to increasing the amount of loans for various items, the amount of loans for seeds and seedlings has been specially increased to ensure farmers' harvests. It has already been discussed and decided at a meeting a few days ago and will be implemented in a few days.</p>

At the end of last month, he arrived in Japan for a short stay and was warmly welcomed by all sectors of the country and the Japanese Emperor. It is now learned that he will arrive in Shanghai on the Coolidge President on the 8th of this month and will discuss important issues at the National YMCA Conference on the 9th and the Church Leaders Conference on the 10th. This is Dr. Mott's ninth visit to China, and he will make a great contribution to our country's future.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association Holds Second Solicitation Conference Yesterday; More Than Fifty People Attended, Including Mayor Wu; Mr. Lu Bohong Creates Tuberculosis Hospital <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association held its second solicitation conference at Mayor Wu's private residence on Haige Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than fifty solicitation team leaders, including Cai Jinjun and Li Tingan, attended. Mayor Wu hosted a tea party and issued membership application forms. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM after a group photo. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Yesterday's attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jinjun, Health Bureau Chief Li Tingan, Tuberculosis Prevention Association Solicitation General Captain Yan Fuqing, Deputy General Captain Lu Bohong, Bu Mei, Honorary Deputy Chairmen Wang Xiaolai and Xu Xinliu, Executive Directors Wu Liande, Xiao Zhiji's wife, Weng Zhilong, and Zhu Hengbi, Supervisors Du Yuexuan and Pang Jingzhou, Directors Ding Fubao, Liu Hongsheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Yunshu, Lin Kanghou, Li Dachao, Diao Xinde, Wang Xiaoying, and Ding Shujing, as well as solicitation team leaders Yu Zuoting, Lai Fengyan, Xi Guansheng, Zhang Xiangwen, Xue Cixin, Lu Ganchen, Liu Jisheng, etc., more than fifty people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the rituals, Chairman Wu Tiecheng reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that since the establishment of the association in December of the 22nd year, it has received enthusiastic support from everyone, and the association's affairs have gradually developed. However, the association deeply feels that this kind of movement cannot be successful overnight. 1.6 million people in China die of tuberculosis every year. It is only because there are 450 million people in the country that so many young and productive people are sacrificed, and it is not felt as pity as the death of an ant. We must know whether personal health will affect the health of the entire nation. National health requires a personal foundation. If we want to revitalize the nation, we must awaken the people and pay attention to tuberculosis. If you have tuberculosis, you become a scourge to the group. We must find a way to prevent it. Today is the beginning of the second solicitation conference. We hope to rely on the great efforts of all gentlemen and ladies, based on Shanghai, so that compatriots across the country pay attention to the great harm of tuberculosis, join the Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association, and fight tuberculosis together.</p>
<p>Li's Report: Then, Health Bureau Chief Li Tingan reported the work report and income and expenditure report for the past year, and reported the three-year plan. Immediately, he distributed membership application forms, 20 to each team leader, 10 copies of the association's charter, and 5 copies of the Healthy Movement Work Report and Plan (from the 23rd to the 24th year).</p>
<p>Yan's Speech: Then, Solicitation Team General Captain Yan Fuqing gave a speech, briefly stating that everyone is very clear about the significance of tuberculosis prevention. He recalled that there was a Mr. Xu who was a very prestigious person in society. He and his wife and five or six children were a very happy family. Unexpectedly, a few years ago, his wife died of tuberculosis in Changsha. Two years ago, Mr. Xu's eldest daughter (about 18 or 19 years old) suddenly contracted tuberculosis (hereditary) and died while studying in her second year of university, which made the family feel incomplete. Unexpectedly, six months ago, the second daughter also died of tuberculosis, also at the age of seventeen or eighteen, when she had just entered university. Mr. Xu was in great mental pain. What he knew was that two months ago, his son also contracted tuberculosis, but fortunately he was diagnosed and treated at the Jiangwan Sanatorium and did not have an accident, but is still in the hospital. From this point of view, the great harm of tuberculosis can be imagined, so we must actively prevent it, but prevention is difficult and requires money. Relying on everyone's strength, I will follow Mayor Wu and everyone else to actively prevent tuberculosis, the great enemy of mankind.</p>
<p>Lu Bu's Speech: Lu Bohong said in his speech, "In addition to the prevention opinions proposed by Mayor Wu, Dean Yan, and others, I also feel that there is a need for a 'large-scale tuberculosis hospital.'" Because chronic tuberculosis is a hundred times more difficult to treat than acute illnesses. It cannot be effective without years of treatment. In addition to founding a mental hospital, which will be completed in May of this year, I have planned to build a tuberculosis hospital near Beiqiao on the Shanghai-Minhang Road next spring, using more than 100 acres of land. Anyone with tuberculosis will be forced to be admitted to the hospital. If it is incurable, they will just stay inside to recuperate, so that they can be isolated from healthy people. The hospital is expected to accommodate more than 600 to 1,000 people. I hope that everyone will assist from the side." Finally, Dr. Bu Mei, the deputy general captain of the solicitation, gave a speech. His words were mostly warnings.</p>
<p>Request to Join: At the end, Mayor Wu hosted refreshments, and Mr. Wei Zhongle played a pipa solo. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The association also issued a request to join, stating, "Dear Sir, our association aims to promote the health of the people and prevent the occurrence of tuberculosis. Since its establishment, it has been more than a year, and we have received the support and assistance of gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life, so all plans can be gradually implemented. If we are given more manpower and financial resources, it will not be difficult for the pre-determined cause to 'be accomplished in three years'. Now, in order to promote the association's affairs, the team leaders have decided to lead the masses on April 6 to accomplish this great undertaking. All talents in the country will certainly agree. Therefore, we hope that you will generously donate a large sum of money to our association, or enthusiastically join us to help us, so that our association's cause can be promoted and enhanced, which will be truly beneficial to the future of national rejuvenation.

<h3 id="e124">German Accuses Chinese National of Trademark Infringement in Film Business; Court Seized Many Cardboards; Hearing Concluded Yesterday Awaiting Sentencing <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Shaojiu, a native of Wujin, Changzhou, founded the Dacheng Snap Button Factory in Jiangyin Village, Nanshi Jiangyin in the past year. It used the Four Five Brand trademark for a short period of time. Now Fucharkel, the German manager of the Wei Luibopo Premium Snap Button Company, has filed a lawsuit with the District Court Procuratorate against Zhang Shaojiu, accusing him of infringing on the company's Three Five Brand trademark by counterfeiting the registered trademark and infringing on exclusive rights. He requested severe punishment according to the law and requested permission to search and seize evidence. After receiving the complaint, the court instructed Prosecutor Xie Lian to send police to Jiangyin Village Dacheng Snap Button Factory to search and seize more than 9,000 Four Five Brand cardboards and summoned Zhang Shaojiu for interrogation and bail. A lawsuit was filed with the Criminal Court. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Director Zhang Peiming opened the twelfth court to hear the case. The plaintiff Fucharkel arrived in court with his private attorney Zou Yu.</p>
<p>First, Zhang Shaojiu said in his statement, "I am 28 years old. I registered with the Trademark Bureau in July of last year and founded the Dacheng Snap Button Factory. On September 3, I received the bureau's review letter, which considered it legal. Then, I submitted the Four Five Brand version to the bureau, which considered that the color and style were the same as the plaintiff's Three Five Brand and considered it inappropriate. Therefore, after receiving the review letter, I changed the color and style and did not imitate it. Please investigate."</p>
<p>Next, Fucharkel said in his statement, "I am 43 years old and a German national. Because counterfeit trademarks similar to the Three Five Brand were discovered on the market, sales fell sharply last year, reducing the transaction by 500,000 gold. The plaintiff's Three Five Brand snap buttons are manufactured in Germany and have been around for more than 30 years. Sales in China have also been around for more than 20 years. In July of the 20th year of the Republic, I applied for registration with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In March of the 21st year, I obtained the bureau's registration certificate, which stated that the exclusive right period was from March 15 of the 21st year to March 14 of the 41st year. Now, the defendant's Four Five Brand snap buttons, their decorations and the words on the bottom plate are the same as those used by the plaintiff, except for the extra 'Four Five' character. His intention to imitate and confuse the public is obvious. I request legal action."</p>
<p>Attorney Zou Yu rose to ask for a private prosecution, briefly stating, "The defendant's factory, such as various machines, probably requires 100,000 yuan of capital. Although it is a small commodity, the procedures are very complicated. Last year, the plaintiff's factory sold 500,000 gold less, which is a loss of more than 20,000 gold at 5%. The defendant should be ordered to compensate,"</p>
<p>At this point, Prosecutor Xie Lian rose to argue, briefly stating, "The defendant imitated the Three Five Brand trademark, the decorations and styles are the same, and more than 9,000 cardboards were seized in the defendant's home. The facts are clear, and I request a public judgment according to the law." The interrogator considered the case clear and the debate was concluded. The sentencing was scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 11th. The defendant Zhang Shaojiu was still released on bail pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Chang Fu-lin from Changzhou, 27 years old, married Li, a fellow villager, 18 years old, as his wife. They had children and lived by farming in their hometown. Unexpectedly, Li was not content with her marriage and secretly fled to Shanghai in April of last year. Under the pretense of being a domestic helper, she engaged in secret affairs and lived in hiding on the upper floor of a coal store in Tangjiawan, outside the West Gate. It was only recently that her husband found out her location, and he came to Shanghai in the middle of last month. He gathered several fellow villagers, including Zhou Ao-da (28 years old, residing at 23 Sanfu Lane, Xieshang Road, working as a tailor), and found Li. Because Li was unwilling to return home with her husband, they forcibly took her to the Second District Public Security Bureau to be sent to the General Bureau for investigation (previously mistaken for the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office). After the Judicial Section reprimanded and advised Li, they ordered Chang to sign a guarantee and take her back to Changzhou. Fearing that Li would be stubborn on the way, on the 18th of last month, they hired car number 12567 from the Zhongxi Automobile Company at 465 Caishi Road in the French Concession, driven by the chauffeur Liu Dianqing, and went to the Public Security General Bureau. They again invited Zhou and others to accompany them, and took Li in the car, planning to go directly to the North Railway Station to take the train back to Changzhou. Unexpectedly, as the car drove past the Yongtai Xiang cigarette and paper store at number 144 on the corner of Route Lafayette and Route Pères Froc in the French Concession, the car slowed down to avoid vehicles and pedestrians crossing the road. Li seized the opportunity to jump out of the car to escape. At that moment, Zhou Ao-da, who was in the same car, also disregarded everything and suddenly jumped down to chase after her, causing both of them to lose their balance and fall, injuring themselves. This attracted onlookers who suspected it was a kidnapping or forced abduction of a woman. They immediately reported to the police station, and detectives were dispatched to send the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Chang and others were taken to the police station. After questioning by the police chief and investigation by detectives, Li's injuries were found to be lighter, and she was released and taken away by Chang. They then took the original car to the North Station to take the train back to their hometown. Details of this were reported in the newspapers on the first of this month. It is now learned that Zhou Ao-da suffered a severe head injury at the time of the fall and was hospitalized. Due to the severity of the injury, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 1:15 AM the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, and detectives were dispatched to move the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. Zhou Jinrong (the deceased's uncle), the chauffeur Liu Dianqing, Dong Jiachuan, Dong Su-shi, and Li were summoned as witnesses. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Second Special District Court, and the court-appointed prosecutor, along with coroner Jiang and clerk Peng, arrived at the scene. It was determined that the deceased, Zhou Ao-da, died from a head injury caused by jumping from the car. After questioning the witnesses about the circumstances of the incident, the court ordered the body to be released to the family for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chen Chang-gen: Chopped with an Axe While Sound Asleep, Fellow Villagers Committed the Heinous Act in the Middle of the Night, the Criminal Escaped and Only the Weapon was Recovered <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Chen Chang-gen from Jiangxi, residing at 90 Burton Road, was sound asleep on the night of the second of this month when he was suddenly attacked by fellow villagers Zhong Peng, Fan Yunfei, and Xu Ji-kui, who broke down the door with an axe and dragged Chen out. Fan and Xu used flashlights to look at his face, preventing him from making a sound. Zhong pulled out a sharp axe and, without explanation, struck Chen's head, hands, and feet with several blows. Chen fell to the ground and cried for help. The perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a panic. Subsequently, Chinese detective Zhang Fa-xiang and Wang Run-he from the Hongkou Police Station arrived after receiving the report. Chen was found lying in a pool of blood, barely alive. He was taken to Tongren Hospital by police car for treatment. His injuries were severe, and he was unable to speak, making it impossible to identify the perpetrators. Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, it was learned that Fan Yunfei was hiding in a carpentry shop at 130 North Henan Road. Detectives Zhang and Wang, along with Western detectives, secretly went to the location and arrested him, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Municipal Council stated that the case originated with Chen Xu-sheng, a Jiangxi native who ran a woodworking shop on North Sichuan Road. He knew Zhong Peng and introduced a friend to work at his shop. Recently, the friend was dismissed, leading to a dispute over wages. Zhong invited several vagrants and took Chen Xu-sheng to a teahouse in Haining Village on Haining Road, where they harassed him and engaged in a verbal altercation. At that time, a Cantonese detective number 40 approached to inquire, but was slashed with an axe by Zhong's accomplices. The detective defended himself with his own pistol, and the group scattered like birds and beasts. It was later discovered that they were all members of the Jiangxi Club on Peng Road, known for their brawling. Police went to the club to make arrests, but they had already fled, and only several sharp axes were confiscated. Subsequently, the group suspected that Chen Chang-gen had informed the police, so they dispatched the defendants to secretly carry out the attack. The victim is currently seriously injured in the hospital and unable to appear in court. After the defendant was apprehended, he was taken to the hospital, where Chen Chang-gen identified him as one of the perpetrators. He requested a postponement for further investigation. When questioned, the defendant stammered and claimed that the perpetrators were Zhong Peng and others who were still at large. Judge Jiang Shu-zi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

As a result, Yan Fuqing was re-elected as president, Lu Bohong and Diao Xinde were elected as vice presidents, Cheng Lian as treasurer, and Zhu Shaoping as secretary.

Because the Fujian Provincial Government had already agreed to allocate public land, and construction needed to begin soon, they requested assistance from the head office. After deliberation, the committee members agreed in principle to the request, but a concrete response would be given after a detailed plan was reported to the head office. The board then discussed the Shanghai sanatorium. According to donors' opinions, the original design included a large auditorium, which was proposed to be converted into a single-story building, divided into two residences. One residence would still be used as an auditorium, while the other would be used as a workshop. To respect the donors' opinions, the committee members decided to approve the renovation. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Investigation into Son-in-Law's Suicide by Drowning, Caused by Economic Pressure <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, a man was found drowned in a well in the unfinished road of Shenjiazhai Road West, Datong Road, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. After being discovered, it was learned that the deceased was Hong Wenzhong, 31 years old, a local man and the son-in-law of the Hong family at number 11. The deceased had an older brother, Hong Renjun, who lived at 41 Huide Lane, near Hanqiao, Qiujiang Road. The deceased originally worked as a telephone operator at the North China Company but was currently unemployed. He married into the Hong family on January 12th of the lunar calendar and was formally married on February 20th. His wife, Fengzhen, 18 years old, was working at the Puyi Yarn Factory but stopped working after the marriage. She only went to work the night shift on the 3rd of this month for two days. Unexpectedly, when she returned home from the night shift on the morning of the 5th, she learned that her husband had drowned himself in the well. She immediately reported it to police officer Zheng Zhiquan at post number 41, who reported it to the Xinzha Branch Bureau. Police chief Zhu Liming was dispatched to investigate and confirmed the incident. He instructed Shao Kuang, the local community leader, to report it to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, prosecutor Kong Xianglin arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased, Hong Wenzhong, had drowned himself. The family prepared a coffin for burial. According to neighbors, the deceased suffered from economic hardship after the North China Company closed down, causing mental disorder and leading to this unfortunate event. Yesterday afternoon, the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau also sent inspector Wu Yihong to investigate. It was learned that the Hong family had been widowed for three generations. Hong Fengzhen and the deceased had been married for only 23 days. Fengzhen's mother, Jiang, 42 years old, had been married to her father for only 13 days. Jiang's 72-year-old grandmother, Sun, is still alive, making them three generations of widows. There are no brothers or uncles in the same clan.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Dredging Bureau: Dredger to Arrive in Shanghai Soon, Already Left the Red Sea and in the Indian Ocean, Expected to Arrive Around the 15th of this Month <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The world's largest dredger, ordered from Germany by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, departed from Danzig on February 8th and is now two months into its journey. However, the ship is travelling slowly, and delays due to weather are unavoidable. Therefore, the expected arrival date in Shanghai is around the 15th of this month. A reporter from Datong News Agency has gathered the following information from the bureau:</p>
<p>Details of the Voyage from Germany: The ship was built by the German Xue Gao Shipbuilding Company. After completion, it departed from Danzig on February 8th, headed for China, and was crewed by Captain Johnsen and First Officer Arndt, dispatched by Xue Gao Company. The route is via the Kiel Canal, out of the Strait of Gibraltar, across the Mediterranean Sea, through the Suez Canal, across the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Expected Arrival Around the 15th: The Dredging Bureau received a radio message from the ship on the 3rd of last month from the Red Sea. It can now be assumed that the ship has left the Red Sea and is in the Indian Ocean. It should arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of this month. However, the ship was designed by Chief Engineer Cha, so Cha will first test its efficiency before formally accepting it and holding a naming ceremony.</p>
<p>Survey of the Shentan Completed: Rumors of two large dredgers being ordered from Germany are untrue. It is said that if another ship is needed for dredging in the future, it will only be considered after the currently ordered ship arrives in Shanghai and its performance is satisfactory. In addition, the Maritime Survey Bureau has completed the survey work of the Shentan (i.e. Tongsha Bar).</p>

<h3 id="e134">Property Dispute of "Manure King," Old Accountant Also Accused, Existence of a Will is the Key Issue in the Case, Court Continued Hearing Yesterday to Obtain Statements from Various Parties <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The late "Manure King" Ma Fuqi (also known as Gu Fuqi), who lived at 183 Weilanmeng Road in the French Concession, and his wife, A Gui-jie, made a fortune by contracting the sanitation business in the English, French, and Chinese areas. They accumulated a considerable amount of wealth, mostly in real estate. They had three sons: the eldest, Hong-kui, the second, Hong-sheng, and the third, Hong-gen. Hong-kui also passed away from illness last year, leaving behind a wife and concubine, as well as a son and two daughters. His wife, Ma Chen, has now filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Court, represented by a lawyer, accusing her third uncle, Ma Hong-gen, and his concubine, Ma Wang (also known as Wang A-da), of embezzling the estate and requesting an investigation. The court accepted the case, and Judge Qiu Huan-ying once held a hearing, summoning both parties for trial. The defendants also hired a lawyer to defend them. The presiding judge also personally visited</p>
<p>Important Witness in the Case: Wan Sanduo, the old accountant of the Ma family for many years, was questioned, and he turned over three keys. All of this has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held in this case. Both parties and their lawyers were present, and the audience was very crowded. Judge Qiu again presided over the hearing in Criminal Court 2. He summoned the parties to the front of the court and ordered the witnesses to leave the courtroom for separate questioning. First, he asked the plaintiff, Ma Chen, "What is the reason for accusing Wan Sanduo again?" She replied, "After my husband died, Wan Erduo opened the iron safe in the house without authorization and took five land certificates, loan documents, and mortgage documents from the safe, along with a coal ball factory passbook and two seals, and hid them." The judge asked, "Did your husband leave a will after his death?" She answered,</p>
<p>"There was no will. The will they presented to the court is forged." The judge asked, "Did your husband say how much property he had at the time of his death?" She answered, "He didn't say." The judge asked the defendant, Ma Wang, "How many keys did your husband give you at the time of his death?" She answered, "Two." The woman immediately handed them over to Wan Sanduo, and on August 25th, they went to the bank to open the safe and inspect the contents. The judge asked, "Did your husband leave a will?" She answered, "Yes, he did. My husband asked Lawyer Huang Zengjie to write it before he died. The will stated that my sister (i.e., the plaintiff Chen) and I would each receive 10,000 yuan, and the two daughters would each receive 5,000 yuan." The judge asked, "Where is the money specified in the will?" She answered, "I don't know." The judge asked the defendant, Ma Hong-gen, "Have you divided all of your inheritance?" He answered, "Not yet." The judge asked, "How much</p>
<p>property is there?" He answered, "I don't know. After my mother died, my eldest brother, Hong-kui, and Wan Sanduo managed it. After my eldest brother died, we wanted to settle the accounts." The judge asked, "Did Hong-kui have any personal property?" He answered, "I don't know." The defendant's lawyer immediately stated, "After Hong-kui's death, the two defendant brothers wanted to settle the property, but the plaintiff did not leave and even took her own son and daughters out. There is a fine letter from the Sino-French School as proof, so it was impossible to settle the accounts." At this point, the court summoned the witness Zhu Min-xuan, the assistant accountant, who stated, "I am 55 years old. I served as the assistant accountant in the Ma family starting on January 7th of last year." The judge asked, "Were all of the Ma family's documents under your custody?" He answered, "All of the documents were managed by the chief accountant, Wan Sanduo.</p>
<p>I only managed the payments. I don't know anything else." The witness Tan Keng-fu stated that he was a close friend of Ma Hong-kui. After Hong-kui died, he gave me three keys for safekeeping. Later, because of the land tax certificate from the Finance Bureau, I went with Chen, her younger brother Chen Guangyu, and Ma Hong-gen to open the silver safe. Chen Guangyu recorded everything." The judge asked, "What was inside the safe?" He answered, "It had nothing to do with me, so I didn't pay attention. Later, I gave the keys to Mr. Wan." At this point, the defendant's lawyer stood up again and said, "If Hong-kui was dying, why didn't he give the keys to his own people? Why did he give them to Tan Keng-fu? Please ask Mr. Tan about the reason for this." Tan answered, "This matter is</p>
<p>not convenient at the moment. I ask the court to understand everything." Then the witness Chen Guangyu (the younger brother of the plaintiff Ma Chen) stated, "Chen is my sister. I went with her when she went to the bank to open the safe. We opened three. The first one contained eleven or twelve bundles of banknotes, an ashtray, and some jewelry. There were also two boxes of gold weights. The second one contained Fangdan Dao deeds and other items. The third one was empty." The judge asked, "Did you record the jewelry and banknotes in detail?" He answered, "I made a brief record, but not in detail." The judge asked, "Do you know that Hong-kui handed over the sanitation business in the French Concession to Hong-gen with a written agreement?" He answered, "Yes, I do. I wrote the agreement." The judge gave this</p>
<p>copy of the document to Chen to read. The judge asked, "Is this how it was written?" Chen took it and looked at it and answered, "No, it is not. This is forged. Hong-kui only signed it, he didn't put a seal on it." As for the witness Yu Zhongming, he was not present at the scene. Ma Hongsheng was then summoned to the stand. According to his testimony, his eldest brother handed him his will before he died and told him to take care of his children. He is carrying the will with him now. After speaking, he took it out and presented it to the court. Lawyer Huang Zengjie stated that Ma Hong-kui, while dying, commissioned my law firm</p>
<p>to his bedside to record what he had set forth in his will. Later, my clerk transcribed it and I stamped it to certify it. Before Ma's mother died, she also commissioned me to write a will. Witnesses Zhang Quansheng, Yu Zhongming, Zhu Ruihua, and others were successively brought to court to testify. By this time, it was past noon. Judge Qiu stated that the facts of the case were complex and that a hearing would be scheduled for a later date after investigation. He told the lawyers representing both parties and the people involved that this case was a family dispute and that it would be best to resolve it out of court during the adjournment to avoid litigation. After speaking, he adjourned the court.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Rudeness and Homicide Case of Ni Yueqiu in Haimen Concluded; Sun Shenshi seeks Justice for her Husband <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Ni Yueqiu, the former head of the Fifth District Office of Haimen, on the early morning of July 14th, 19th year of the Republic of China, led the district's security team members, along with Cheng Rusong, the captain of the county police team, to Changchun Town to arrest alleged communists. On the east side of the Dabai Temple in the town, a pedestrian named Sun Yuanfu was identified as a suspected communist and shot dead. The Haimen County Government sent personnel to verify that the deceased Sun Yuanfu had gunshot wounds to his left eye and chest, confirming that these wounds caused his death. On August 22nd, Captain Cheng Rusong of the county police team, based on a report from secret agent Liu Guanghan, learned that Chen Weirong, a resident of Qilin Town, was suspected of being a communist. He dispatched the leader of the third team, Jia Weiping, along with Ni Yueqiu, the head of the Fifth District Office, to Chen's residence, where Chen Weirong was arrested and taken to the county. Subsequently, Chen's son, Chen Zhouxiang, secretly invited Ni Yueqiu to Chong San Yi Inn and bribed him with a 1,000-yuan bank draft (from the De Kang Qian Zhuang) to plead with the county magistrate for his father's release. Soon after, Chen Weirong was indeed released. However, after some time, the county government, believing Chen Weirong was indeed a communist, extradited him to the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, the charges were dropped, and Ni Yueqiu was dismissed from his post. Fearing the consequences, Ni went into hiding in Shanghai. Sun Shenshi, the wife of the deceased Sun Yuanfu, learned of this and filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. An order was issued to arrest and bring Ni Yueqiu to court. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu repeatedly investigated and confirmed the facts and prosecuted Ni Yueqiu on charges of dereliction of duty and murder. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Court President Liu Enrong opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Sun Shenshi, testified that she was 49 years old, from Haimen, and lived in Changchun Town. Her husband, Sun Yuanfu, had retired from the Ninth Army Quartermaster Department in the 19th year of the Republic of China and was soon after shot and killed innocently by Ni Yueqiu and others. She requested justice and compensation of 8,000 yuan in bereavement benefits, weeping as she spoke in a very tragic manner. The judge ordered the imprisoned Ni Yueqiu to be brought to the court, who stated that he was 39 years old, from Haimen, and denied the charge of shooting Sun Yuanfu. The defendant's lawyer then presented their defense. The judge considered the case closed and scheduled the verdict for 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month. Ni Yueqiu was remanded in custody pending the verdict.</p>

<p>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Committee yesterday to request an appropriation of 400,000 yuan in provincial funds to continue spring relief efforts. The telegram stated: "To Chairman Huang and all members of the Zhejiang Relief Committee in Hangzhou, having investigated that the one city and twelve counties allocated by the various provincial charitable relief associations are unable to manage the redemption. We previously telegraphed the provincial government and your committee regarding the overall planning for spring relief. The city and counties are pleading for spring relief, and it is not appropriate to leave them out. Of the one million yuan in provincial funds, 400,000 yuan remains unspent, which can be used to carry out spring relief in the city and counties. Please quickly request that it be allocated as soon as possible. Awaiting reply. Chu Fucheng, Zhang Yin, Wang Xiaolai, and Jiang Yin of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association."</p>
<h3 id="e140">Overview of Drought Relief Efforts in Gaochun <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Gaochun News: The drought last summer was extremely severe in this county, affecting three-fifths of the county and impacting over 20,000 households. The area is traditionally poor, and the aftermath of the drought has left residents struggling. The county government formed an early disaster relief committee, uniting party and government officials and local gentry, and appealed to provincial authorities and charitable organizations in Shanghai and Suzhou. County Magistrate Yuan Jimei personally went to Shanghai and raised over 20,000 yuan in emergency relief funds, which were distributed to save those on the brink of starvation. They also secured 60,000 yuan for work relief, deciding to allocate 40,000 yuan for dredging rivers and 20,000 yuan for constructing ponds. The dredging of the Yaxi River, approved by the province, began on February 19th of this year. The river is 7.73 kilometers long and has been silted up for many years. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers, the project is progressing rapidly and is expected to be completed in mid-March. Currently, over 3,000 workers are employed daily. Each worker's relief funds, calculated to support a family of three, can help 10,000 disaster victims. After the river is dredged, the fields directly benefiting along both banks will amount to 13,350 mu. Assuming an annual value of 15 yuan per mu, the total value will be 200,250 yuan. The acreage indirectly benefiting from the irrigation of its tributaries is difficult to estimate. Furthermore, the previously submerged fields of Guanhudang will be completely dry, yielding over 2,500 mu of fertile land, increasing annual production by 25,000 yuan. Other benefits, such as land price and tax revenue, are too numerous to list. It is fitting that the local people are joyous and excited.</p>

<p>Wang Lianxiang, a 16-year-old apprentice from Nantong at the Xinwanxing pastry shop at 119 Xidou Road in the French Concession, went out at 7:00 PM on the 16th of last month to collect bowls and plates for pastries. While walking in front of 175 Malang Road, he accidentally bumped into Guo Xiucai (14 years old), the son of Guo Liyu (39 years old, residing above the mezzanine at 107 Ximenli, Ximen Road), a Anhui man selling cold glutinous rice. During their playful scuffle, Guo Xiu cai's head was injured, and he bled profusely. Guo Liyu, seeing his son injured and bleeding, rushed over and grabbed Wang, beating him with fists and feet, causing Wang to be injured and return to the shop, where he was bedridden. Guo then went with his son to the Xinwanxing pastry shop to demand compensation for medical expenses. After learning the reason, they sent Wang to Guangci Hospital and reported the incident to the French Concession police, who arrested the Guo father and son for investigation. Wang died from his injuries at 5:00 AM the next morning. The shop reported the death to the court, and the coroner's examination revealed that he died from internal injuries caused by the beating. The police handed the Guo father and son over to the Second Special District Court, where the police department filed a public prosecution against them for causing death by injury, according to the criminal law. This was previously reported. The case has now been concluded by President Wang Gangxu of the Second Special District Court after repeated hearings. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, President Wang ordered Guo Liyu and Guo Xiucai to be brought to the Criminal Court One, sentencing Guo Liyu to eight years in prison for causing death by injury, with eight years of deprivation of civil rights. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final will be used to offset the prison term at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment. Guo Xiucai was acquitted. During the appeal period, both defendants will be held in custody.</p>

<p>To the Editor, upon investigation of the "Resolution of Weights and Measures Disputes" item in the Wuxi Deshun column of your newspaper on April 6th, it stated that "rice merchants from six counties, including Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Yu, Wu, and Wu Jiang, lost a lot as Shanghai measures three he more than their own. The Wu Jiang County Government notified weight officials from eight counties to bring weights and measures to Shanghai for inspection, and to attend a meeting at the Inspection Office, chaired by Director Zhou of our office. After discussion, it was decided to re-determine the weights and measures tolerance and that this office would re-examine the weights and measures in this city by early May and submit them to the Ministry of Industry for record." Upon investigation, inspection officers from six counties including Wuxi visited our office on the second of this month for a private conversation only. On that day, Mr. Ni from Wu Jiang claimed that the five-dou measure in this city was three he more, requesting inspection. Director Gu was of the opinion that even if this was the case, the number three he was still within the legal inspection tolerance, so the director did not agree to the inspection request. The matter of re-determining the tolerance and submitting it to the Ministry for record is even more untrue. Correspondingly, we request that you correct the record. Please investigate and handle it accordingly. Sincerely, the Shanghai Weights and Measures Inspection Office, April 6th.</p>

<p>Among the various loans mentioned above, the Bank made special contributions in line with the purpose of assisting the national economy. These include food grain and cotton in agricultural products, cotton yarn in industrial products, coal in mineral products, and railway transportation in transportation services. Except for the railway transportation, which is described in another chapter, for the food grain, although imported rice accounts for only about 2.5% of domestic rice in recent years, its value is over 10 million yuan. Although imported wheat accounts for only about 4.5% of domestic wheat, its value is over 80 million yuan, resulting in a large outflow of capital. This is mostly due to the uneven distribution of domestic grain in different regions and the large price differences. Therefore, the Bank provides warehousing, collateral loan and remittance facilities for the collection and distribution of rice and grain, regardless of whether it is transported from farmers or grain merchants, wherever the Bank's institutions are located. In addition to serving rural areas, the Bank also hopes to make a slight contribution to the transportation and distribution of agricultural products. As for cotton yarn, it is related to the clothing of the people, and the outflow of capital to foreign countries has been very large over the years. In addition to providing considerable assistance to the competing weaving industry, the Bank also strives to facilitate the supply of raw materials, as the prices of cotton and yarn have been diverging in recent years, greatly affecting the yarn industry. For example, measures to promote the production, transportation, and sale of cotton are intended to assist agricultural production, as well as the textile industry. Coal is essential for industrial power and daily social needs. Coal is the most abundant mineral resource in our country, especially in North China. Therefore, the Bank has provided much assistance to major coal mines and has strived to promote the distribution of coal production to make it more socialized and popularized. By promoting sales and abundant production, the Bank directly and indirectly promotes the interests of this industry and its related aspects. B. Savings Department (A) Deposits (1) Total Deposits. The total balance of various savings deposits for the year 1934 was 43,281,406 yuan, while it was 31,678,629 yuan for the year 1933. This year's increase was 11,602,777 yuan.

<h3 id="e150">Ministry of Education Orders Revision of Graduation Examination Regulations; Middle Schools and Normal Schools Abolish School Graduation Examinations; Semester Examinations Still Deeply Implemented in the Final Semester <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th dispatch) The Ministry of Education has issued an order to all departments and bureaus stating: "Having examined the current system where students in senior and junior high schools and normal schools must pass a school graduation examination before being allowed to participate in the graduation examinations. Only after passing the graduation examinations can they obtain graduation qualifications. Most graduates must also take entrance examinations for senior high schools and colleges or universities and can only continue their studies after being admitted. This requires junior high school students to undergo three examinations in a short period of time around the summer vacation of their final semester. The timing of the school graduation examination and the graduation examinations is very tight, and the subjects are the same. Furthermore, those who fail one or two subjects in junior high school are not issued certificates for applying to higher education institutions. Although they can apply to senior high schools with equivalent academic qualifications, the number of spots is limited. Also, there are no regulations on how to handle students who have been admitted to higher education institutions if they still fail the re-examination of one or two subjects. The Ministry has repeatedly considered all of these issues. In order to rationalize the examination system, it has been decided to abolish school graduation examinations in middle schools and normal schools (but junior high schools that do not participate in the graduation examinations or apply to higher education institutions should still hold school graduation examinations as before). Semester examinations will still be held in the final semester for the courses studied in that semester. The average grade for each academic year will be the school graduation grade. According to the regulations of the graduation examinations, it will be combined with the results of the graduation examinations. In addition, the issuance of certificates for applying to higher education institutions for those who fail one or two subjects in junior high school, and the method of remedial instruction for those who have been admitted to higher education institutions after failing one or two subjects, have been revised or supplemented in the original regulations. In addition to issuing separate orders to comply with the revised middle school and normal school regulations, and separate orders to comply with the middle school student graduation examination regulations and the normal school student graduation examination regulations (i.e., the revised provisional regulations for normal school student graduation examinations), you are ordered to comply with them and relay them for compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Analysis of Subjects Studied by Students in National Vocational Schools <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's statistics on the overview of national vocational schools and above in the 21st year have been reported previously. The following is an analysis of the subjects studied by students and graduates in higher education vocational schools and above (including universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools) in the 21st year.</p>
<p>(1) In the 21st year, the total number of students enrolled in vocational schools and above nationwide was 42,710 (universities: 25,635, independent colleges: 10,005, vocational school students: 343, vocational schools affiliated with universities: 1,084, affiliated with independent colleges: 2,555). By subject, the number of students in "science and engineering fields" was: science: 4,159 (universities: 3,855, independent colleges: 172, vocational schools: 31); agriculture and forestry: 1,557 (universities: 1,044, independent colleges: 189, vocational schools: 324); medicine and pharmacy: 1,852 (universities: 847, independent colleges: 637, vocational schools: 38); engineering: 4,439 (universities: 3,114, independent colleges: 899, vocational schools: 426). The number of students in "liberal arts fields" was: arts: 9,312 (universities: 5,909, independent colleges: 1,673, vocational schools: 1,712); law and politics: 4,523 (universities: 6,633, independent colleges: 5,153, vocational schools: 1,737); education: 3,368 (universities: 2,200, independent colleges: 663, vocational schools: 703); commerce: 1,867 (universities: 1,995, independent colleges: 485, vocational schools: 387).</p>
<p>The total number of graduates was 7,311 (undergraduate universities: 4,275, independent colleges: 1,240, vocational school students: 696, vocational schools affiliated with colleges: 842, affiliated with universities: 258). By subject, the number of graduates was: "University": science: 481, agriculture and forestry: 160, engineering: 602, medicine and pharmacy: 110, arts: 1,086, law and politics: 1,347, education: 241, commerce: 248. "Independent College": science: 16, agriculture and forestry: 21, engineering: 123, medicine and pharmacy: 117, arts: 93, law and politics: 647, education: 26, commerce: 87. "Vocational School" (including those affiliated with universities and colleges): science: 5, agriculture and forestry: 146, engineering: 150, medicine and pharmacy: 76, arts: 480, law and politics: 513, education: 209, commerce: 217.</p>
<p>(3) Comparing the past few years, the number of students in science and engineering fields has been increasing, while the number of students in liberal arts fields has been decreasing. The reason for this is the restriction on the number of students admitted to arts and law fields and the restriction on the establishment of law fields. Education must be adapted to actual needs, and educational authorities must strive to remedy the oversupply and lack of talent. Recently, not only has educational administration provided guidance and improvement for higher education in terms of the establishment of departments and the admission of students, but also the schools themselves have mostly changed to establish subjects that are adapted to the needs. Even students, in order to find jobs easily, pay more attention to selecting subjects.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Construction Method for the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society; The Central Government Actively Promotes Land Administration <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The second annual meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society began on the 5th in Nanjing. The second general meeting continued on the 6th, passing a resolution to establish a Ministry of Land Administration under the Central Government and ordering all provinces, cities, and counties to actively promote land administration. Furthermore, regarding the current land policy in China, the society, after deciding through the second general meeting, summarized opinions from all parties and, after discussion and revision by all attending members, resolved as follows: The highest principle of our country's land policy is the equalization of land rights advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Although opinions on the interpretation of the equalization of land rights vary slightly, the understanding of the principle is generally the same. The theoretical basis of the equalization of land rights is that land should belong to all citizens. In other words, it recognizes that pure land rent should belong to the state and be implemented through land value tax and incremental value tax. The purpose is to seek an opportunity for all citizens to enjoy the rights and interests of land equally nationwide and to exclude private monopolies, using land as a tool for exploitation. Observing the current national economic situation and social organization, China's current land policy should pay attention to the following four points: 1. Quickly determine land prices and implement a progressive land value tax and incremental value tax to equalize the burden on the people, limit the power of the powerful, and prevent annexation. This will allow the state to collect land rent, the people to be freed from the oppression of harsh taxes, and the land to be fully managed, so as to promote the prosperity of the national economy and the peaceful development of society. 2. Immediately determine rental amounts based on the stipulated land prices, strictly enforce rental amounts, and, in the spirit of equality and cooperation, reform the tenant rent system to ensure a fair allocation of rights and interests between landowners and tenants, so that labor and capital can cooperate closely and each can benefit, rural areas can be stabilized, and the entire society can be expected to progress. 3. Implement the establishment of land financial institutions to regulate the rural economy, conduct land credit lending to encourage land development and support independent farmers, and supervise the use of land to integrate the intention of controlling land use, so that it meets the trend of national economic production and construction. 4. The state should immediately implement a land reclamation policy to regulate the distribution of land and population, develop wasteland, increase production, and enrich the border areas. The reclamation of border areas should be based on the principle of state-owned enterprises. The colleagues of this association believe that the above four points are the outline of China's current land policy and will strive to promote its realization.</p>

<p>The first lecture will be held at 5:15 PM on the 12th of this month at the International Art Theater, No. 50 Nanjing Road. The speaker is Dr. Mohr, and the topic is "The Life and Works of D.H. Lawrence, a Modern British Novelist." The reason for Lawrence's success is that he wrote "Lady Chatterley's Lover," which nakedly depicts the state of love between men and women, similar to the style of novels such as "Jin Ping Mei" in China, but it is a new approach in European and American novels. Lawrence is an Englishman, and British society is still deeply secretive about the issue of sex. After the publication of Lawrence's works, it naturally caused an unprecedented reaction, and the book spread quickly, which was also expected. Dr. Mohr is not only Lawrence's doctor but also his close friend. In the two years before Lawrence's death, he was almost inseparable from him, so he has a thorough understanding of Lawrence's personality, his thoughts, his character, and his artistic tendencies. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is Lawrence's closest confidant. Because the International Art Theater has limited seating, those who want to attend the lecture should call 18843 to request admission tickets.</p>

<h3 id="e160">The German World Games Venue Will Be Completed This Year; The Grandstand Can Accommodate 20,000 Spectators... The Women's Dormitory Has Been Completed... German Athletes Receive Special Training... Help Find Excellent Positions <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>(National News Agency Berlin Dispatch) In 1936, the eyes of the world will once again focus on Berlin because the 11th World Games (Olympic Games) will be held in the German capital. This is not just a matter for Germany or Europe. So far, 41 countries have registered to participate. According to its significance, the venue should also have a huge construction to achieve the purpose of the conference. The reporter specially visited Dr. Timm, the secretary-general of the organizing committee, to inquire about everything. According to the conversation, as follows:</p>
<p>Huge Project</p>
<p>Dr. Timm said that the construction of the Olympic Games is proceeding actively according to the original plan. We must not underestimate it. The area of the venue is 130 hectares (one hectare equals more than one mu in China), and construction is required everywhere. Therefore, the construction of the venue is indeed a huge project. The foundation of the Dietrich Eck stand in the venue has been prepared in order and is expected to be completed this year, and then the interior construction will begin. The carefully constructed sports field can also be used. The foundation of the main venue and the path for the opening ceremony can be completed this winter, and the entire project can be completed by the end of 1935. The swimming pool has been started, and one part of the training ground has been completed. It has now been decided to open a red cinder track for the first time in Berlin. The Hochk Field (Hahoy) has started construction and a 76-foot-high clock tower is being built, with the Olympic bell hanging on it. This bell was donated by the Boehmer steel plant and has recently been cast. The racecourse has also been prepared for construction, and the stables will be built this year, and then flowers will continue to be planted and lawns will be laid. The most magnificent part of the construction in the venue is the Dietrich Eck grandstand, which can accommodate 20,000 spectators and has now taken shape and can be used for large-scale performances. There are also sports equipment facilities here, such as boxing competitions, etc. There is also a special competition venue paved with granite.</p>
<p>Women's Dormitory</p>
<p>Part of the women's accommodation in the sports field and one part of the sports meeting platform have been completed. In addition, a magnificent circular hall will be built in the German sports field. The design is made by the famous engineer Werner March and is gradually being implemented in reality, making Berlin the largest sports equipment venue in the world in 1936. German leader Hitler is very optimistic about various projects because he sees such progress in its construction in a short period of time. Although most experts have not completely resolved the various problems in it, we will find ways to solve such pending cases and coordinate the entire project. There are as many as 12,000 people currently working on this large project, and more people are needed this year. However, in addition to the purely construction-related issues, there is now the overall interior decoration, such as the program list should be printed in five languages. By 1935, when the conference office is built, the entire venue construction and everything else will be completed. Most of these issues have now been resolved. In short, our completion of the Olympic Games is not only the completion of external construction, but also all sports in the projects that should be carried out by the conference must do our best and strive to do it.</p>
<p>German Selection</p>
<p>The reporter also visited the director of the organizing committee, Busch, and asked about the selection and training of athletes. According to the conversation, our German Olympic competitors are still continuing training according to the original plan. However, this kind of training must pay attention to special performance when the Olympic competition officially starts. Usually, winter training is conducted at Hochk Field, and the finals are still held at this venue in summer. All Olympic participants will also train hard, and their highest form of performance can be obtained by 1936. Participants should continue to select the best under any circumstances, persevere and resolutely fight, because whoever has a determined heart must have a goal, and can achieve their goals in the Olympic venue, and those who can be selected as athletes have their own high reputation.</p>
<p>Special Training</p>
<p>Then give special teachings, such as circuit running or various light sports competitions, swimming competitions, and select the assumed champions of the country. It is most likely to happen. Each trainee trainer is responsible for the social standing obligations and must encourage the participants. For example, if some participants are still unemployed, they should be helped to find a suitable position, and better jobs should be given to those with excellent skills. This is indeed a psychological element of sports that we cannot ignore. However, this time, training must be carried out in order and legally. When performing in competitions, there are many actors prepared for each item, so they can be replaced and supplemented at any time, because in each actor team, they are not allowed to know whether they are participating in sports from beginning to end, so as to avoid unloading their psychological responsibilities. The competition procedures for 1936 will be implemented by the competition schools and review institutes. Because of the different sports, the review institutes are divided into various review groups, which are composed of experts respectively. If it is the Olympic preliminary round, the most outstanding representative team can be selected by the review group. The training results last year (1934) showed a significant increase because the route taken by each trainer was very correct. This is the evidence of its progress. However, the Olympic athletes in our country are still uncertain because the emerging athletes have a strong breakthrough. When the conference opens, there should be a leap forward. If each election has a solid position at all times, the old athletes will prevent the position of the newcomers and prevent their special efforts to maintain their own position. If the Olympic Games in 1936 opens, with our sure estimate, the various preparations will be more perfect.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Western Merchants Weak and Incompetent, Dong Hwa Wins Six to One, Strength Greatly Disparate, No Excitement, Dong Hwa Still One Point Short of Championship <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>After the unfortunate incident last week, the Dong Hwa football team was severely punished by the Western Football Association. Wan Xianghua, Chen Jiaqiu, and Lu Zhongen were all suspended. However, Dong Hwa has a wealth of talent and many reserves. Yesterday, they played against the Western Merchants in the Group A match at the Recreation Ground. The lineup was still vibrant and they defeated the Western Merchants by a score of six to one. With one more point, they will secure the championship. Yesterday, the weather was favorable, and more than five hundred people came to watch.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyi and Chen Yichen Successively Score</p>
<p>The match began, and Dong Hwa immediately took the offensive. After ten minutes, Li Yichen dribbled the ball forward, and the opposing inside defender committed a handball, resulting in a penalty kick. Li kicked it, but missed, and Dong Hwa lost a good opportunity. Then Li Yichen passed the ball to Dai, who lived up to expectations, received it and immediately shot, the ball entering from the left corner. Soon, Jia Youliang got an opportunity for a corner kick. Li Yichen couldn't wait and scored the second goal with a skillful volley.</p>
<p>Dong Hwa Takes the Lead in the First Half</p>
<p>After losing two goals in a row, the Western Merchants tried hard to counterattack. Forward O'er kicked fiercely at the goal, and the goalkeeper Guan caught the ball over the white line, resulting in a goal for Western Merchants. Later, the Western Merchants' lineup became disorganized again. Jia Youliang crossed from the wing, and A'Dai had no chance to shoot, so he passed it to Li Yichen, who indeed scored again. After that, Dong Hwa's offensive was quite strong. Li Yichen missed two good opportunities very close to the goal, which was a pity. At the end of the first half, Dong Hwa took a 3-1 lead.</p>
<p>Chen and Dai Score Again After the Break</p>
<p>After the break, they switched sides and continued the battle. Dong Hwa continued their efforts and attacked vigorously. The Western Merchants found it difficult to resist, allowing Dong Hwa to attack freely. Chen Chutian was still strong and vigorous, showing his past prowess, scoring two goals in succession. After a long scramble, Dai Linjing scored another goal, and Dong Hwa won 6-1.</p>
<p>Dong Hwa Missed Many Opportunities Yesterday</p>
<p>Overall, in yesterday's match, Dong Hwa lost three key players, but their strength did not diminish. Chen Yutian, as a veteran of the battlefield, was most praised by the audience. Gu Shangjiao also worked very hard yesterday, running around the field, showing extraordinary bravery. Li Yichen and Dai Linjing missed many opportunities yesterday, with potential for more than ten goals. Was this Dong Hwa's misfortune?</p>

On the 3rd, they first played against the Ministry of Railways mixed team (Jinghua Ministry of Railways) at the Ministry's field. Leji's forwards were sharp and the defense was solid, resulting in a 9-0 victory. As a result, Leji's name resounded throughout Beijing. When they played against the Public Association Football Team on the 4th, more than a thousand people came to watch. Because Leji's forwards cooperated purely and enthusiastically, and the defense was effective, they still won 4-1. It is said that the team is scheduled to return to Shanghai today. They fought two games in Beijing this time, both of which were a complete victory. It is a pity that they did not compete with Jinghua, Central, and Jinling to determine the winner.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market slightly rebounded due to the tightening exchange rate market, with large operators adding to their short positions. However, there was no sign of a reversal in sentiment, so when unfavorable overseas news arrived, it immediately weakened. Turnover was normal in the morning, and the market was extremely mediocre, fluctuating narrowly within three yuan and two jiao. As a result, it rose slightly by six jiao. In the morning, although the overseas silver market showed large forward premiums, the spot market reported weakness. Although the New York silver market rose, forward silver market premiums varied. The exchange rate opened high and contracted, and London spot gold fell four and a half pence. Sentiment was extremely flat. Outside the market, the pre-market trade opened at 873 yuan and four jiao. Although it rose slightly afterwards, because the central bank's gold tender standard price was listed at 899 yuan and eight jiao, retail investors sold slightly and turned flat again. The morning opened slightly higher. After opening, large investors jointly poured in, banks plugged in and bought American currency, and the exchange rate seemed to tighten, immediately rising. It was learned that HSBC's listing showed a flat British currency and an American contraction of 0.0625. At this time, the situation was uncertain. Although there was a small setback, the overall trend was still stable and could be maintained. The Bank of Japan and Mitsui strongly bought American currency, Sassoon continued to buy shillings, and Wansheng purchased large orders, gradually rising.

<h3 id="e182">Investigation: Revival of Anhua Tea Industry in Hunan - Strong Russian Sales Drive Production - Last Year's Production and Sales Exceeded 80,000 Boxes <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Historical Overview: Anhua is the most prolific tea-producing area among the 75 counties in Hunan province, holding a significant position in China's tea exports. Its tea production history dates back to the Xi Ning era of the Song Dynasty. Before Xi Ning, Anhua was part of the "Meishan Barbarian" territory, controlled by the Mei clan in the border region of Xinhua and Anhua. Xinhua was known as "Upper Mei," while Anhua was "Lower Mei." In the fourth year of Xi Ning, the Mei territory was conquered, and Anhua County was established, with tea farms set up. Tea produced in Yixi Mountain, Zijiang Benping, and other areas was considered superior in quality. A local saying at the time stated, "I'd rather eat Anhua grass than Xinhua's best," indicating that even the lowest grade of Anhua tea was superior to the highest grade of Xinhua tea. Tea trees grew naturally on the mountain and river cliffs. During the spring, many people were involved in tea picking and processing. The government stationed special officials to oversee the process, and the tea produced was offered as tribute to the capital, known as the "Four Bao Tribute Tea," with Daqiao, Xianxi, Longxi, and Jiuboshui designated as the "Four Bao." Each year, the county distributed funds (40-50 taels of silver) to local leaders at the Grain Gate to oversee production. The tea produced at the time was green tea and black tea. Green tea was sold in Hunan province and neighboring areas, while black tea, known as "Yin Tea," was sold in the northwest, including Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Mongolia. The name "Yin Tea" originated with Zuo Zongtang. In the early years of Guangxu, when Zuo Zongtang was campaigning in Xinjiang, he requested that the salt administration system be emulated, with 40 packages forming one "Yin," contracted to merchants for official sales. Most of the merchants entering the mountains to produce tea were from Wuyi, Fujian, as Fujian Wuyi tea was popular in the north at the time. When Fujian's production fell short, merchants rushed to Anhua to pick and process tea. Later, Shanxi merchants also arrived, forming their own group. The Shanxi-Jin merchants' guild hall still exists in Huangshaping today. The tea produced by these merchants was all black tea, sold in the Northwest. After the opening of the seas, Chinese tea was exported overseas, and foreign markets preferred red tea. As a result, during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, Guangdong merchants came to Anhua to produce red tea, spreading the red tea processing method to local households. Subsequently, due to the strong sales and good prices of red tea, most tea merchants switched to producing red tea, including those from Shanxi who had previously specialized in black tea. The production and sales of red tea were most developed during the Guangxu era. At that time, there were over 80 tea houses in Dongping, Gaokou, Huangshaping, and Xizhou, producing 700,000-800,000 boxes of tea annually. Later, due to failures in the export trade, production gradually decreased to 400,000-500,000 boxes, then 300,000-400,000 boxes, and before the European War, only 200,000-300,000 boxes. After the European War, during the 7th and 8th years of the Republic, the industry was severely depressed, with tea mountains barren and desolate. Tea merchants then switched back to producing black tea for sale in the Northwest. In the 12th and 13th years of the Republic, the red tea market showed signs of recovery, and in the 15th and 16th years, some tea mountains were reclaimed. However, after China and Russia announced the severance of diplomatic relations in the 16th year of the Republic, Russian merchants could no longer directly purchase tea in Hankou, and the sales of red tea to Russia stagnated. Although British trading houses in Hankou continued to handle some shipments to Russia, the volume was much lower than direct trade. As a result, the industry declined again. Last year, when China and Russia resumed diplomatic relations, Russian merchants came directly to Hankou to purchase and transport tea, and all the accumulated stock of tea merchants was sold out. The price of #3 tea exceeded that of neck tea, and the volume of sales reached 40,000-50,000 boxes. Some tea houses made profits of 20,000 yuan or several thousand yuan. Last year, the number of tea merchants entering the mountains to produce tea increased slightly. There were over 30 red tea merchants in Dongping, Gaokou, Huangshaping, Youzhou, Jiangnan, and Xiaoyan, producing over 10,000 boxes of red tea. It is expected that the number of tea producers will increase even more this year.</p>
<p>Tea Planting Overview: Anhua is divided into two districts, the front and back. The most abundant tea-producing areas are all in the back district, centered on Dongping and Huangshaping, followed by Youzhou, Jiangnan, Xiaoyan, Bianjiang, Lantian, and Xianxi. The terrain is characterized by layered mountains and very little flat land. The soil is yellow and ocher sandy loam and clay loam. The total tea planting area is approximately 100,000 mu. The tea trees are generally of native varieties, with small trees, thick and soft leaves, and mostly triangular seeds. For propagation, seeds are collected before the Cold Dew solar term and sown in nurseries either at that time or in the following spring. After two years, they are transplanted to the main garden, but some also directly sow seeds in the main garden. In terms of management, the land is generally plowed once in the autumn when weeds have not yet withered. Very few people use fertilizer. Intercrops include peas, broad beans, soybeans, corn, buckwheat, sugarcane, and peanuts. Leaves are harvested twice a year, after Grain Rain and after Mangzhong. The yield per mu is approximately one hundred jin.</p>
<p>Tea Processing Overview: (1) Red Tea: In the preliminary processing of red tea, fresh leaves are sun-dried until properly withered, then swept together and kneaded until the leaf juices are fully extracted. The clumps are then broken up, air-dried, kneaded again, and dried again. They are placed in barrels, covered with cotton, and fermented for a period of time until the color turns reddish-brown, at which point they can be sold. However, some are dried further. This is the initial processing method. The refining process is more complicated. After tea merchants receive the raw tea, they first roast it once for about 15 minutes, adjusting the time based on the dryness of the raw tea. After roasting, the tea is stored in official warehouses for about two to three days, then fired again, called "re-firing." After re-firing, the tea is loaded into loose boxes, taken upstairs, and manufacturing begins. Initially, a coarse "rain" sieve is used to sift out the raw tea beads. After being rubbed with a sieve, it is re-sieved. The tea from the bottom of this sieve passes through a raw tea "long horse" sieve, using a nine-level sieve to "scoop". The tea from the surface of this sieve is called "raw tea neck." After firing and drying, it is crushed and sieved again. The tea from the bottom of this sieve is divided into first tea, second tea, third tea, fourth tea, coarse rain, medium rain, bud rain, iron sieve and raw powder, where raw powder is flower fragrance, the material from the bottom of the ninth sieve, with a shape like powder. All these types of tea except raw powder, are then placed in a wind machine. The powder sorted out by the wind machine, is immediately discarded or mixed in the flower fragrance. The remaining tea, is loaded into loose boxes and brought downstairs, where female workers are responsible for picking selecting, called "raw picking." After this raw picking, it is brought upstairs and sifted again with the sieve surface being clear tea pearls which are natural pearl tea. The bottom of the sieve is sorted into original body, neck, second, third, and fourth tea, and coarse rain, medium rain. After "sifting" and scooping again, the sieve face is clear tea head. The sifted original body tea, is taken downstairs for repeated selection, then a wind machine is used to blow away the ash, then one more firing is done before sorting and packing into boxes to complete the manufacturing. Last year's red tea production was 42,600 boxes of boxed tea, 1,500 packages of raw red tea, 2,600 packages of flower fragrance, and 1,000 packages of tea stalks.</p>
<p>(2) Black Tea: Anhua black tea is mostly produced in Jiangnan, and the best quality comes from Huangshaping. In the processing method, fresh leaves are put into a wok and stirred with a three-pronged fork until the leaves wither, soften, and become like cotton wadding. They are then taken out of the wok and piled on the floor, where they are trampled until the leaf juices are fully extracted. The clumps are broken up after approximately three times and then taken out and roasted in a drying rack to dry. Black tea is a coarse tea, ranging in length from an inch to a foot. Production is divided into yellow and black types. The black type is sold in Shaanxi, known as "Shaanxi Yin," and the yellow type is sold in Gansu, known as "Gansu Yin." These are all referred to as "Yin packages." The best quality teas are wrapped in palm bark, called "Flower Rolls," and bundled into branches using bamboo strips, each branch weighing 1,000 taels. These are mostly sold in Shanxi. Black tea is generally sold in the northwest provinces and Mongolia. Nowadays, some is also sold to Soviet Russia. Last year's production was 13,000 flower rolls and 15,000 large packages (each package weighing 140 jin). In the past ten years or so, due to poor sales and low prices of red tea, most farmers have switched to producing black tea, as the processing method is simple and the tea can be stored for a long time, waiting for a better price. The production of red tea has gradually decreased.</p>
<p>(3) Green Tea: Anhua green tea is produced in Qiaotouhe and Lantian. The crude processing method does not require fermentation, and the refined method is largely similar to that of red tea: (1) stir-frying leaves for about four minutes, (2) kneading for fifteen minutes, (3) breaking up the clumps and air-drying for five minutes, (4) re-kneading for ten minutes, (5) breaking up and air-drying for three minutes, (6) re-kneading for fifteen minutes, (7) drying for twenty-five minutes. Last year's production was about forty shi, priced at around 30 yuan per shi. The tea is generally shipped via Meijiang to Xiangxiang, Ningxiang, Changsha, and other places for sale, with no sales to other provinces.</p>
<p>Tea Merchant Overview: Anhua tea merchants are generally composed of capitalists from Shanxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, divided into the Xi (Shanxi) group, Yue (Guangdong) group, and Xiang (Hunan) group. Those from Hunan are called the "local group," while those from other provinces are called the "guest groups." The Xi group (Shanxi) has the most disciplined organization and the strongest capital. Most of their organizations adopt a shareholder system, with very few being operated by a single person. The capital of each firm ranges from several thousand to over ten thousand yuan, specializing in buying raw red and black tea, refining it, and transporting it to Hankou for sale. Black tea is then transported to the northwest via the Pinghan Railway. There are a total of 28 trading houses, which provide tea warehouses, manufacturing equipment, and assistance to merchants in buying tea, charging 57 wen per thousand. In terms of taxes, garden owners pay 13% for group defense, community security, township administration, industry, and charitable donations. Tea merchants pay 1% as a business tax, with a silk tax revenue of around 60,000 yuan last year. Tea merchants traditionally use a 76% scale for raw tea (i.e., every 100 jin is counted as 76 jin), even though the actual discount need not be so high, but due to old habits, it is difficult to change.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Supply and Demand of Jiaoji Railway Coal <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The recent supply and demand trend of Shandong coal, especially Jiaoji Railway coal: Several years ago, due to political instability and the decline of various industries along the railway line, supply and demand were both around 2 million tons. However, later, as the political situation gradually stabilized and various industries along the railway line recovered, the demand for coal increased. In addition, after the protection tariff was raised in May of the previous year, Japanese coal and Fushun coal gradually decreased, replaced by domestic coal, i.e., a sharp increase in the demand for Jiaoji Railway coal. Especially the excellent quality Boshan coal, this should have been a period of active demand. However, the domestic coal mines have immature equipment and cannot fully meet this demand, which is a great pity. Recently, although each mine has plans to expand equipment to increase production, whether this can be realized in this era of difficult financing is a question.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although Zhongxing Coal's production could not be satisfactory due to political instability (more perfect equipment) and various other factors several years ago, since the political situation has changed, it has proceeded according to its set plan. Currently, annual production is increasing and has now exceeded one million tons per year. As mentioned above, there are still no great expectations for the output of Jiaoji Railway coal in the future. However, the demand from the railway line and the coastal ports continues to increase, and there is currently a shortage. If there are no major changes in tariffs in the future, the demand for Jiaoji Railway coal and Zhongxing Coal in the Shanghai market will inevitably increase sharply. Based on the supply capacity of these three (Jiaoji Railway Coal, Zhongxing Coal, and Kailan Coal), the competition in the Shanghai market in the future will not be too fierce. From a general economic perspective, all industries in the world tend to decline, and the coal mining industry will inevitably decline along with them. However, at present, due to special reasons such as insufficient supply, tariff protection, and urgent needs at coastal ports, it may not fall into decline at the same time. The following table lists the production, transportation, and other conditions of Jiaoji Railway coal in the past five years.</p>

<p>— Qián Chuò Héng Jiǔ</p>
<p>Dear Children! If someone asks you, "What does our national flag look like?" I believe you will quickly answer, "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Red Ground." But if they ask you again, "What is the meaning of our national flag? Who created it?" I think many of you may not be very clear about it, right? Now let me tell you:</p>
<p>Our national flag was created by the revolutionary martyr Mr. Lu Haodong before the Guangzhou Uprising. The blue, white, and red colors on the national flag represent freedom, equality, and fraternity. The twelve corners of the white sun represent the twelve two-hour periods of the day: Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai.</p>
<p>Children! Do you all understand the meaning of our national flag now?</p>
<h3 id="e185">Faraday's Childhood <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Jūn Péng</p>
<p>Children! Who invented the generator? Everyone knows it was the great American scientist Edison, that's right, but how could Edison and others have used it to create electric lights, streetcars, telephones, and all kinds of electrical machinery? Well, that's because of this Faraday! Because many people in the world know about Edison, but few know about Faraday, so I'll tell you a little about his life for you to listen to!</p>
<p>Faraday was the son of a blacksmith, so of course the family was not well-off, and he didn't study; it had nothing to do with blacksmithing; how could Faraday be sent to school to study! At the age of thirteen, he began to work as an apprentice with Libo to learn bookbinding, and did so for seven years. This apprentice had a very strange temperament, reading books while binding them; during this period, he bound an encyclopedia, and there was an essay in the book entitled "Electricity," and he cherished a grand ambition to attack electricity, so he saved money and bought instruments and chemicals to do that kind of chemical trick.</p>
<p>One day, he heard that the Royal Society's famous chemist, Mr. Dai Pei, was going to give a public lecture in London. At that time, a customer came to buy something from him, and he asked this customer if he would be willing to do the favor of inviting him to London to listen to the lecture. The customer readily agreed and bought four admission tickets for him. Faraday went to the city to listen to the lecture, writing down notes as he listened, and when he returned to the shop, he wrote a long letter to Dai Pei, and showed him the notes, requesting an interview. Later, Dai Pei wrote back inviting him to talk, and at that time he also asked to work at the Royal Society, so that he could study science. Finally, he invented the generator and its principle. Faraday was undoubtedly the founder of the electrical world.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Science Mr. Bends Magic <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Red and Black Separate Families</p>
<p>One warm spring, Science Mr. appeared on stage again. He held a horseshoe-shaped thing in his hand, raised it and said to the audience:</p>
<p>"Children, do you know what this is? This is a horseshoe magnet, commonly known as a 'magnet'. Its property is that it can attract steel. Today we are going to use it to do a very interesting magic trick."</p>
<p>After he said that, he took out a plate, a file, and a rusty nail from his pocket. Then he filed the rusty nail with the file for a while, and the plate was covered with black iron filings and red rust powder. He shook the plate a few times to mix the two things.</p>
<p>"Now, this red iron powder and black iron filings are one family." Science Mr. said, "But we have to separate them, red with red, black with black. Children, do you have any appropriate methods?"</p>
<p>The children in the audience all shook their heads, feeling that such tiny things could not be picked up by hand, nor could they be used—there was simply no way.</p>
<p>"Haha! Nothing could be easier! You see..." Science Mr. picked up the horseshoe magnet and brought it close to the bottom of the plate. Sure enough, the black iron filings jumped up one after another and adhered to the head of the horseshoe magnet. The head of the horseshoe magnet suddenly looked as if it were covered with fine hairs, which was very beautiful.</p>
<p>"Now, the black ones are all attracted to the horseshoe magnet, and the red ones are all left in the plate. This is called 'Red and Black Separate Families'."</p>
<p>Then there was a round of applause from the audience.</p>
<p>"Why can horseshoe magnets only attract iron filings and not rust powder? It turns out that in humid air, the oxygen in the air combines with the iron on the nail to form rust. At this time, the properties of rust are different from the properties of iron; therefore, the horseshoe magnet cannot attract it."</p>
<p>"If you want to perform this magic trick, a horseshoe magnet is indispensable. You can buy it from instrument stores—the Science Instrument Museum on Fourth Malu in Shanghai—for eighty or ninety cents each. With this horseshoe magnet, we can also play many other kinds of magic tricks; I will show you these next time."</p>

<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>How fast time flies, in the blink of an eye, the annual travel season—spring break is here again!</p>
<p>Children, you have at least ten days to play during this spring break. You must not waste this great time in a rush. So, will you bury your heads in books all day during the spring break? No, absolutely not. These days of rippling spring air and beautiful spring scenery are not suitable for studying all the time. We should visit Qingxiu, majestic famous mountains, or historical sites to travel. This can not only comfort our body and mind, but also increase our knowledge. The wonderfulness of Sima Qian's articles is entirely obtained from travels.</p>
<p>Now let me introduce Min'er's travel plan for your reference.</p>
<p>(1) Monday, go to Longhua with mom, and take the opportunity to visit the Longhua Airport once.</p>
<p>(2) Tuesday, invite Zhang Jian to go to the field to fly a kite.</p>

<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>We clean the house every day. Fine dust is invisible to the human eye in dark places. If it is in a place exposed to sunlight, you can see dust scattered in the air. This many dust looks like it is flying very lightly in the air, but in fact it is mixed with water droplets, sand flakes, metal shavings, microbes, sanitary insects and other things, so it is not light. Water is seven hundred times heavier than air, and there is a lot of water floating in the air, but if the water droplets are as big as raindrops, they will fall very quickly. If the diameter of the water droplet is one tenth of a millimeter, its falling speed will be three seconds; if the diameter is one hundredth of a millimeter, the falling speed will be five minutes; a water droplet with a diameter of one thousandth of a millimeter will take eight hours and fifteen minutes; and a water droplet with a diameter of one ten-thousandth of a millimeter will take eight hundred hours. Fog is transformed from water, and the falling speed of fog is between five and ten minutes. Dust originally exists in various parts of the room and scatters into the air due to the vibration of the wind, but because there are various substances in the dust, the falling speed is also very different. The heavy ones will fall to the ground in one or two seconds, and the light ones will still be scattered in the air after a day or a month and cannot fall. Therefore, when we clean the house, we should open more windows and ventilate the air, so that the dust stirred up by brooms, chicken feather dusters, and bricks in the room can be blown out of the windows by the outside wind. However, we clean the room every day, and although the heavy dust gradually falls to the ground or because it is on the walls and other utensils, the light dust flies in the air for a day or two because the falling speed is very slow. Then, it can be said that there is dust flying in the room all year round.</p>

<p>— Hua Nan</p>
<p>Children! Let me ask you: After you exercise, sweat, and after a while, why do you feel cold?</p>
<p>Children! Please think about it first, and then read my answer.</p>
<p>It turns out that after you stop exercising, sweating stops. But what about the sweat that has already come out? It evaporates, and when it evaporates, it needs a lot of heat, and this heat is absorbed from your body, so you feel cold.</p>
<p>So, children! When you exercise, you must not take off your clothes again because of the heat. You should wait a few minutes and then put on the clothes you took off, otherwise you will catch a cold.</p>

<p>Children's Day has passed! What should we feel?</p>
<p>The children of wealthy families and the bitter children wandering the streets clearly divide the joys and sorrows from wealth and poverty! Children's Day seems to be decorated for aristocratic families! Poor children from poor families. Don't feel anything? I am also a member of the bitter children's team. I remember when I was young, I received education and baptism from my loving mother's hands. Although the school was three to five miles away from home, I still had to walk! In rainy and snowy weather, in order to avoid wading, I only brought some coarse rice flour? Hiding in a corner of the school kitchen, I asked the chef for a little boiling water to mix and use as lunch. Sometimes I bought some sweet potatoes to satisfy my hunger, regardless of people's ridicule! The students who went to school had money for meals in the school. At that time, although I was very sad! But I was determined to study hard! In every school exam, I was always at the top of the list. So I firmly believe that people's hands and brains are omnipotent! "Accumulating wealth of thousands is not as good as having a skill." I advise the bitter children comrades now, you must know the true meaning of Children's Day! Strengthen your bodies, work hard in your studies, and strive to emerge from difficulties and hardships! Achieve economic independence and have the ability to create careers for the happiness of the masses!</p>

<p>Sinbad's Fourth Voyage</p>
<p>The joy of my family life soon eliminated the fear in my heart. Before long, I set off again, this time taking the route through Persia, doing business on one hand and seeing the unseen scenery on the other.</p>
<p>Finally, I arrived at a port, and from there I set sail with my goods. We entered ports everywhere, and my goods sold very well, and in a short time I had unloaded almost everything I carried.</p>
<p>One day, far from the land, a strong wind suddenly rose. Although everything was done to protect us, the ship soon became a wreck, and several lives were lost.</p>
<p>My good luck was again in my favor, because I grabbed a board, on which several friends were already riding. We were swept by the tide to the shore of a small island, just in a high and dry place.</p>
<p>There we found fruit to eat and a clear spring to drink from. We stayed on the shore all night. But when the sun rose the next day, we got up and set off, walking towards several huts that looked very far away from us.</p>
<p>As we approached, a group of black people came up and took us to their homes. They made us sit down and gave us an herb; they gestured to us, saying that we could eat this herb.</p>
<p>My friends ate as they were told, but I saw that the black people did not eat, so I thought it must be a trick to harm us. I did not eat mine, and it was good that I did not eat, because my poor friends soon lost consciousness and did not know where they were or what they were saying.</p>
<p>Then the black people fed us rice and oil to eat. My friends ate a lot, but I did not eat much, because I had already seen through these plans. The herb was to deprive us of our will and power of movement, and the rice was to make us fat—because these black people were cannibals.</p>
<p>Soon I felt that my thoughts were right, because they ate my friends one by one, but I was too thin and did not touch me. They gave me freedom to wander near the hut, but the thought of fear of death made me thin day by day, but they wanted to wait for me to get fat before eating. My unhealthy body became my greatest benefit, and my life was saved because of it.</p>
<p>One day I strayed a little far from the hut and decided to escape. At that time, there was only an old man near the house, and I did not care no matter how much he called.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Children's Science Lecture: Types of Vegetables <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Children, don't you always have vegetables with your meals every day? There are many types of vegetables, but when we eat them, we always eat their roots, stems, leaves, and fruits. Some vegetables can be eaten for their vegetables, roots, or fruits. Some vegetables can only be eaten for their roots but not their leaves. Ordinary vegetables have the following four distinctions.</p>
<p>(1) Leafy vegetables: We mainly eat the leaves of this type of vegetable. Although the other parts can sometimes be eaten, they are not the main parts. Like the cabbage and rape in (Figure 1), we see that the leaves are very fat, but the stems can also be eaten. Onions and garlic cannot distinguish between stems and leaves, but they are generally included in the leafy vegetables.</p>
<p>(2) Root vegetables: The leaves and stems of this type of vegetable cannot be eaten, because their nutrients are all in the roots, and the roots are very developed and fat. As shown in (Figure 2), onions, sweet potatoes, radishes, and turnips belong to this category.</p>
<p>(3) Stem vegetables</p>
<p>This type provides us with a part of the stem for food. The lettuce, celery, and wild rice shoots shown in (Figure 3) are all examples. Although their leaves also grow very lushly, their taste is not as good as the stems.</p>
<p>(4) Fruit vegetables</p>
<p>The roots, leaves, and stems of this type of vegetable cannot be eaten, but their melons and fruits taste very good. The pumpkins, boxes, spicy eggplants, and cattails shown in (Figure 4) are all eaten for their fruits.</p>
<p>Children, when you eat vegetables, can you tell which part of the vegetable is provided for us to eat? This is a very interesting research question!</p>

<h3 id="e195">The Misfortune of German Women <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yan</p>
<p>Chung Hwa Daily (Berlin Reuters Dispatch, February 18): "Today the authorities issued a red and black notice with the words 'Listed Criminals' written on it. Thus, the people of Xilin knew that the two female spies, namely the former Baroness Baek and Mrs. Nazina, were about to be executed. The two women were convicted of conspiring to sell Germany's mobilization plan to a foreign country. In Germany, this is the first time that anyone has been executed for this crime in peacetime. The Baroness was dressed in ordinary prison clothes and first came to the execution platform. With one stroke of the axe, her head rolled into a blue basket filled with rice crumbs. It is said that Poland's mobilization plan was revealed."</p>
<p>This newspaper (National Telegram from Berlin, March 31): A young woman of twenty-five was sentenced to be beheaded today. Her crime was that she indulged in pleasure in歌臺舞榭 while allowing her three young children to starve to death at home.</p>
<p>This newspaper (Reuters Dispatch from London, April 5): (1) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Walter House asked about the two German women who were hiding in a house in London and died suddenly yesterday. It was found that one of the two women was Dr. Fabian, a German socialist and writer, and the other was Mrs. Wim, also a writer. It is now believed that both died of free poisoning. Hua asked the authorities to investigate the truth of the matter, as it was heard that the death of the two women was related to foreign political groups.</p>
<p>(2) According to the leader of the Paris Bar Association, Geoffrey, today, it is now known that the sudden death of the two German women hiding in London was not due to suicide. The Germans living in Paris and the Germans who are associated with the two women who died are all uneasy and do not know where to turn for protection. The two women had exposed the activities of the National Socialist Party members in London.</p>
<p>After reading the above news, I know that Germany has sentenced a total of three women to be beheaded in three months. Two women who were hiding in London died suddenly, neither from suicide nor from disease.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that German women have participated in various occupational fronts since the European War, and have gained the right to vote since 1919. They have made considerable achievements in production work and participation in political power. But recently they encountered Hitler, who is good at exploiting them. He used the voting rights of millions of German women as a pillar of the National Socialist Party. Once his dictatorship succeeded, he immediately turned his face and asked them to return to their families, forbidding them from participating in politics and prohibiting them from engaging in paid labor. This is Hitler's exploitation of women and the great reward given to women!</p>
<p>Under this circumstance, German women, instead of obediently staying at home, helping their husbands and raising their children, became spies, spies for the rebels, and of course deserved to die. However, according to the laws of the so-called civilized countries, the punishment of beheading is considered too uncivilized and has been abolished. Hitler's reapplied use is nothing less than the true nature of a tyrant!</p>
<p>The emergence of romantic women has its social roots. Hitler does not carry out fundamental treatment, but only blames one side. The romantic woman may have had other difficulties in letting her three young children starve to death at home while indulging in pleasure in歌臺舞榭. Most middle and lower-class women in Germany are trapped in their livelihoods. Moreover, under the slogan of "giving women's jobs to men," the lives of unemployed women are of course a problem. Therefore, the romantic woman probably wanted to escape from life and seek pleasure. Otherwise, how could her three young children starve to death? However, Hitler does not seek out the root cause that caused them to starve to death, but puts a weak woman to death. The method of putting her to death is also a cruel punishment that civilized countries have not dared to try again—beheading!</p>
<p>As for the news that the two German women died suddenly in London, although the truth is not yet clear, after reading the above news carefully, it is undoubtedly clear that they were coerced to death. Of course, political activities in another country cannot be immediately arrested and beheaded. Therefore, beheading is replaced by causing them to die suddenly. The method cannot be said to be ingenious. Mrs. Ulen said, "The victory of the German National Socialist Party is due to the great efforts of the national women." But what happened to German women after the National Socialist Party won? Let's still use Mrs. Ulen's words to answer: "The current German women have completely eliminated the achievements gained through decades of hard struggle and reversed to the state of the century." (See this magazine's "Women under Hitler's Rule")</p>
<p>German women "have reversed to the state of the Middle Ages." The above news is further proof of this conclusion.</p>

<p>Since the decline of the primitive matriarchal system and the establishment of the patriarchal system, many difficult contradictions and oppositions have occurred in ethnic societies. That is to say, there have been many different social strata, such as slaves and slave owners, the rich and the poor, farmers and handicraftsmen, the privileged and the powerless. There are conflicting interests between them, which often cause conflicts and struggles. This struggle not only stirs up social chaos, but even puts the entire society into a crisis of common collapse and death. Therefore, in order to resolve this contradiction, a mediation agency is needed. This agency is the most primitive form of the state. However, with the concentration and strengthening of social economic power, it finally became a power organ used by slave owners or the rich to suppress slaves or the poor. Its oldest and most typical example is the ancient Greek and Roman slave labor system states.</p>
<p>The state also made considerable and effective arrangements in the struggle between matriarchal and patriarchal power. Many social scholars do not pay much attention to this point, but I think this is a question worth studying.</p>
<p>The transition from a matriarchal society to a fundamentally different patriarchal society must have been a major social change, and this change was not implemented so "peacefully." On the contrary, we can see the struggle between patriarchal and matriarchal power in many legends. That is to say, among the warring peoples, there are still many legends about female heroes (Amagon). They led many powerful women soldiers to participate in the war. Even the queen of the African barbarians, the Dagona, is leading an armed female guard. In this way, there is no doubt that men had to go through a long struggle to seize the dominance of women. The state's task in this regard is very important, that is, to stipulate clear laws regarding the issue of men's and women's rights, making women legally in a non-human position. Needless to say, in ancient society, even in the laws of modern civilized countries, the state's organ for suppressing women's rights is fully expressed.</p>
<p>Ancient Greece and Rome built the first brilliant civilization in human history, but this so-called civilization was actually built on the sacrifice of women and the blood and sweat of slaves. It is said that around the fifth century BC, among the 200,000 residents of Athens, Greece, slaves accounted for 100,000, free people only 20,000, and the remaining 80,000 were foreigners without rights. Only these 20,000 free people were a special class with dominance. They absorbed the cream and blood of 100,000 slaves, deprived all women of their human rights, and indulged in extravagance and pleasure. This is the characteristic of the "civilization" of slave society!</p>
<p>Regarding the enslavement of women, Bebel said this: "They were the first humans to become slaves! Before the existence of 'slaves', women were already slaves!" ("Women and Society")</p>
<p>However, there is an essential difference between the enslavement of women and the enslavement of some men. Because firstly, "women" do not belong to the category of social class, it is only an abstract sexual distinction. Therefore, in class society, "women" themselves must also have class divisions. Secondly, the decline in the status of women is based on their loss of the right to important productive labor in the national economy, rather than due to forced labor. This is what we must pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Kolontai said this: "Many people think that the subordination and powerlessness of women are based on the establishment of private property rights, but this is a wrong view... The subordination of women is due to the sexual division of labor, that is, men bear the productive labor, and women bear the auxiliary labor. The more this division of labor is, the more severe the restrictions women suffer... The private property system only helps to promote the subordination of women. (Women's Labor Revolution)</p>
<p>To give an example, in ethnic societies, the status of farming women is still superior to that of pastoral clan women, because farming labor is suitable for women, and women occupy an important position in production. Pastoral labor is suitable for men, and women occupy a supporting position in production. Therefore, although after the collapse of the matriarchal system and the establishment of the private property system, the rights of women continued for a relatively long time among the farming peoples where women occupied an important position in production. However, the private property system gradually split the ethnic community economy into an independent individualistic family economy, and within the family, it also caused the sexual division of labor. In other words, women are responsible for household kitchen work, and men are responsible for productive work outside the home. On the other hand, with the development of economic technology, various occupations other than animal husbandry and agriculture have emerged, thus discovering various specialists, such as potters, leather workers, weavers, merchants, samurai monks, etc. These occupations are all handled by men, and women are only in a supporting position. As a result, women have become unimportant in the national economy. This has also become a household slave for giving birth to children and serving husbands. The status of women in slave society and all male-dominated societies can only be correctly understood from this perspective.</p>
<p>Speaking of the status of women in Greece and Rome, it can no longer be explained with a general concept. Women belonging to free people and women belonging to slaves belong to completely different class categories. The former and the latter have distinctly different lifestyles and identities. However, this difference is only that the former are slaves of free people and the latter are slaves of slaves. The wife or daughter of a free person with dominance naturally has her own things, and it is the remnants of her father's or husband's privileges. They themselves have nothing, and only do work such as washing, weaving, cooking, raising children, and guiding domestic servants in the family. Moreover, they live a long-term life of prostitution under the absolute oppression of men. As for female slaves, their subordinate relationship to male slaves is relatively slow. This is because both men and women are equally powerless, unfree, and subordinate, and suffer the same hardships of labor, distress, fatigue, and hunger. What subordination is there to speak of here! Only the anger and resistance to free people are burning in their hearts.</p>

<p>On Children's Day!</p>
<p>Amidst the grand celebrations of Children's Day!</p>
<p>Before the theater doors, silk banners with golden characters on a red background, proclaiming "Celebration Assembly," fluttered in the breeze.</p>
<p>On the walls, posters were plastered, filled with slogans for the welfare of children.</p>
<p>Under the eaves, leaflets more captivating than stories of "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" were scattered.</p>
<p>Groups of children, led by their teachers, filed through the iron gates of the theater.</p>
<p>Those without teachers—no, the poor children who had never had the fortune to enjoy education—could only clutch the iron gates with small hands, peering inside with longing eyes.</p>
<p>—"Why won't you let me in?"</p>
<p>—"I don't know! Ask the Children's Welfare Association!" The reply was as cold and hard as the ice congealing on the edge of the pond in December!</p>
<p>The "speeches" were always impassioned, and no one would say half a sentence that wasn't fashionable.</p>
<p>However, "Revive the Chinese Nation!" "Defeat Imperialism!"... These were things that the children sitting on the sofas certainly wouldn't understand. Their teachers had only told them, "There will be games to watch!" "There will be gifts to receive!"</p>
<p>Who understands this personal suffering? Those on the coal heaps, in the factories… perhaps right there by the iron gates.</p>
<p>The slogans of the assembly numbered ten in total!</p>
<p>Shouted out, they were truly resounding! As if the theater building itself would collapse.</p>
<p>But, after all, this was a theater, with strong walls and thick doors, completely separating one world from another.</p>
<p>The sounds drifted, drifted… hit the wall! Gone!</p>
<p>Games ahoy!</p>
<p>The children all loved watching the two young ladies with purple and green thin silk headscarves, performing the "Fengyang Flower Drum" dance.</p>
<p>"...Poor families sell their sons, but I have no sons to sell, so I carry my flower drum and travel the land!"</p>
<p>"...How many families are buried in the bellies of fish, how many families have no clothes to wear…"</p>
<p>"...Men died on the battlefield, leaving behind women and mothers in the villages. I have traveled thousands of miles, everywhere there is hunger and cold, everywhere is desolation!"</p>
<p>The singing was even more beautiful than the song of a nightingale!</p>
<p>Hee hee ha ha…</p>
<p>Clap clap clap…</p>
<p>Dismissal!</p>
<p>"Children's Goodie Bags" are here!</p>
<p>—"One for each person, don't rush and grab!" A crowd of children quickly ran over, as those distributing the gifts loudly shouted.</p>
<p>—"Ha! 'Children's Books and Newspapers'! A toothbrush... ha!"</p>
<p>—"Ha! Toothpowder, 'Little Friend'... ha!"</p>
<p>The laughter stretched out long, reaching the iron gates.</p>
<p>The poor children couldn't help but swallow their saliva.</p>
<p>—"Why won't you let me in?" Some anger, some sorrow!</p>
<p>—"I don't know, ask the Children's Welfare Association!" The reply was still cold and hard.</p>
<p>All the same a child!</p>

<h3 id="e198">German Women Under Hitler <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Translated Excerpt from Mrs. Uren's Speech</p>
<p>This article is an excerpt from the speech of Mrs. Uren, a former German Democratic Party protector, delivered on the London Broadcasting Station during the Fourth Current Affairs Conference held in New York on September 27, 1934. The speech fully describes the recent situation of women in Germany. It is specially translated for the reference of those who are interested in women's issues. - Translator</p>
<p>The victory of the German National Socialist Party (Nazi Party) was largely due to German women. In the years before Hitler seized power, the living standards of laborers and the middle class were very low. Therefore, millions of women who had worked for bread were forced to struggle on the front lines of life! Many middle-class women could only settle for the positions of secretaries, clerks, and other low-level jobs. Working women bore the triple burden of being housewives, mothers, and laborers. They all hoped that one day they could avoid this desperate labor for food and clothing. Usually, very few working women could feel the economic and spiritual independence of happiness; most of them regarded work as an unavoidable burden!</p>
<p>Hitler's Deception</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Hitler happened to put forward the slogan that all men should be given wages sufficient to fully support their families. This was something that German women had been looking forward to day and night. At the same time, he also promised that all young women could be guaranteed to marry and have husbands. Millions of women, burned by this desire, used their voting rights as a pillar of support for the Nazi Party. Therefore, in the electoral districts held separately for men and women, the voter turnout of women was much higher than that of men.</p>
<p>However, by the eighteenth month of the Nazi Party's rule, not only had the great wishes of women not been realized in the slightest, but also the status of women had been transformed into a more unfavorable state! The legal, economic, and political rights of equality between men and women stipulated in the 1918 Constitution were eventually completely abolished!</p>
<p>The Nazi Party vigorously advocated the idea that a wife being a mother is the "natural duty of women." They believed that women's participation in public life and intellectual issues was a result of the decadence of modern life. On February 12, 1934, Bels said at the Nazi Party Women's Congress: "We are making women retreat in all areas of public life. This is not only not a disgrace to women, but it is a restoration of women's honor."</p>
<p>Ignoring Women's Advancement</p>
<p>In fact, the Nazi Party is indifferent to the various achievements made by modern women. They have not seen the good phenomena after women left the kitchen and participated in various intellectual activities. They only see the external changes.</p>
<p>One of the manifestations of this view of women is the great change in women's education. According to the new law, the number of female university students must not exceed one-tenth of the total number of students. Not long ago, various universities in Prussia held a 25th-anniversary celebration of opening universities to women. At this time, German news was written with this headline:</p>
<p>"Today, on the 25th anniversary of women's acquisition of the right to education, women are once again encountering a period of transition that will make them leave the university first."</p>
<p>Restrictions on Women's Education</p>
<p>In Nazi Party schools, girls do not have to receive preparatory education for studying science. The things that women in the new era should study are considered unnecessary.</p>
<p>In a certain periodical, "German Women and Their Tasks," the new elementary education order is described as follows:</p>
<p>"We must understand what kind of knowledge should be taught in today's girls' schools. I think national and family affairs; the science of heredity; the German soul overseas; and knowledge of air defense are all vanguards of the entire line of education. At the same time, swimming, cooking, hiking, family music, and family education are also essential subjects to learn."</p>
<p>In addition, military training has also become an important course for women and children. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e199">Duobaolin in Hankou <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>—Price: One Hundred Wen—</p>
<p>Prostitution, like other trades in the society that produces it, has distinctions from top to bottom in goods and prices to suit the status and pockets of its patrons. Moreover, this recognized legal commodity—prostitutes—is like the rice and grain that cannot be missing for a day. Whether it is as noble as princes and marquises or as lowly as dung collectors, it has its supply.</p>
<p>Take Hankou Town as an example. The grades of prostitutes include flower wine costing hundreds or even thousands of yuan, and places where the overnight fee is only one yuan or several dimes. And I also know of a brothel that operates during the day, with each time costing two hundred wen.</p>
<p>Anyone who lives on Central Street, as long as they hear the words "Duobaolin 22," men, regardless of age, will show their yellow teeth and put a smile on their faces that seems contemptuous and greedy. Women, on the other hand, act as if these three words are… as if they haven't heard them, or they slip away. "Duobaolin" is just a small name, and the actual situation in the neighboring alleys is also true. First, at the end of the road, there is a square pond, which is truly a stagnant pond with green water all year round. Not far from the pond is a large public toilet. Third, less than two feet away from the toilet is a well that supplies people with water for washing and drinking. Fourth, and the biggest fact is that in the vicinity to the left and right of that well, there are scattered five or six small, dirty, and dark bungalows. These bungalows are small shops specializing in selling women's bodies.</p>
<p>Because these shops are of a semi-public and semi-private nature, there is no organization. Each family is run by the hostess herself, but the husbands who are the heads of the family can be divided into three categories: one is unemployed vagrants, one is people who cannot make a living due to contracting serious diseases, and one is opium addicts. Moreover, the other three treasures in the four treasures are all factors that contribute to the development and growth of this fourth treasure.</p>
<p>In the stagnant pond of the first treasure, there are several dyeing workshops that bleach cloth all year round. The cloth that is bleached is all blue printed cloth that is sold in the surrounding villages. The meager wages of these bleaching workers are, of course, not enough to support a family in Hankou, where everything is expensive. Therefore, these temporary or permanent single men have unknowingly formed the regular patrons of the five or six small shops.</p>
<p>The benefits of the second treasure, the public toilet, to these five or six houses are even greater than the stagnant pond. Many hawkers whose capital is only about one yuan, clerks in small shops, workers in workshops, or older apprentices—these people are all forced by life to not be able to regularly solve their sexual desires; because most of them cannot afford to marry wives, even if some have married wives in their hometowns, the women are forced to live in the countryside all year round or outside the city where rent and living expenses are cheaper due to their husbands' economic strength. Moreover, the workshops and small shops in the interior still retain the form of the medieval family handicraft era in their treatment of employees. They—the employees and apprentices—except for a few days off during the lunar New Year to go home, are usually forced to live in the master's house, that is, all of their time has been sold to the master. When these poor employees and apprentices go to the public toilet, as long as they have enough copper coins on them, they cannot resist the torment in their hearts, nor can they resist the obvious temptation in front of them, so they often tiptoe into the half-covered board door. People can often see some hawkers selling hot food, selling candy, and selling miscellaneous goods entering the alley after going to the toilet, and in the blink of an eye, both people and burdens disappear behind that board door.</p>
<p>The third treasure, the well, and the first treasure, the water pond, have equally great power over the prosperity of this brothel. The largest consumer of this well is the only large sauce garden in Central Street, ××. Since the well is public, no one will interfere even if the well water is used up in one breath. The owner of the sauce garden understood this point, so although the garden was equipped with tap water, making sauce, making soy sauce, washing melons, washing vegetables, cleaning melons, and pickling vegetables were all done with well water. Whenever the sauce garden started making soy sauce, and when the work of cleaning melons and pickling vegetables started in early autumn, the workers in the backyard of the store, like ants moving house, from dawn to dusk, only saw them carrying well water to the backyard. In a few years, the second concubine of the sauce garden owner had married in. People always said that the well water mixed with urine and feces made him rich. In fact, can well water turn into sauce by itself without manpower? Compared with the boss, the workers in the backyard are really as poor as beggars. The wages of two or three yuan cannot support the wife in the countryside, so their sexual desires are also taken care of by tasting the goods of two hundred wen in the spare time of carrying water.</p>
<p>These semi-private and semi-public prostitutes, because they have a low-profit policy, can also support a family every day with their income on days when the police do not come to cause trouble often. But they, who are trampled under heavy iron hooves and have no other way out, are now the only producers of the family, but if the husband is not happy, he will beat and scold them, and the people around them have always regarded them as natural prostitutes who are not worth mentioning. Even more pitiful is that under this social situation, their women and children are also forced to follow their bloody path to destruction. Among these five or six families, two have daughters. One is named Caiyun, and one is named Qiaoyun. Caiyun's parents are both over thirty years old. When she was thirteen years old, she was sent to the theater to learn opera. Qiaoyun's fate is different. Her father is over fifty, and her mother is only over forty. The two can skip meals every day, but opium cannot be less, so in the year she was fourteen years old, her parents, looking at the money, married her to an old man who was two years older than her father. It is the sixth or seventh concubine, and everyone is still not sure.</p>

<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>April 6th</p>
<p>Miss Lian had lunch here today, and after lunch, she sat in my room all the time. Actually, it doesn't seem like Miss Lian comes to our place for any fun. Originally, she didn't need to come often, firstly because of her relationship with the Fifth Concubine, and also because she was raised by our old lady from a young age. It is said that her mother died of postpartum fever after giving birth to her, and later her stepmother didn't love her, so the nanny took her to the countryside to raise her from a young age. She was only brought back by our old lady when she grew up to twelve years old. Later, her stepmother withheld her tuition fees and made her live in school to study. So she often said, "All relationships are about money. If money doesn't make trouble, bad things will happen." Because of her bad experiences from a young age, her body is still not healthy. She said she doesn't blame her stepmother, only her father for being too rich. She is determined not to fight with her stepmother's children for her father's property.</p>
<p>Although Miss Lian is a bit inexplicably opinionated, sometimes the two sentences she says can really hit the heart of the matter. For example, she said today, "A woman's excessive dressing up is entirely for men." I think this is quite right. When I was living a life of hanging up a sign, that kind of life with nine layers of rouge and seven layers of powder every day, almost none of my companions didn't hate it, but in order to do business, to receive guests, even when I was so tired that I didn't want to wash my face, I would rather not wash my face, and the rouge and powder had to be smeared on.</p>
<p>Later, when I was about to get married, I thought that with a fixed husband, this kind of too tedious dressing up could be avoided. Who knew that having a husband was the same, if you didn't want to dress up, the husband would force you to dress up; he said that marrying a wife was like buying something to eat, it had to be palatable and beautiful. Later, I took this sentence to ask many noble ladies, and they said that their husbands all held the same view, but the wording was different. A man spends a lot of money to marry a woman, isn't it for her body and appearance, what else is it for?</p>
<p>April 7th</p>
<p>I'm already six months pregnant with the child in my womb, and I feel tired all day long, but Elder × still asks me to stay up so late with him every day. When we go out, he even forces me to wear high-heeled shoes, I really don't want to walk a step in those kinds of shoes!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I argued with him a few words again because of wearing shoes, and he immediately said, "Now you have shoes to wear, and you still don't wear them, as if you're putting on airs with someone. Look, I won't buy good shoes for you to wear in the future, I'll buy them and send them to Miss Tang!"</p>
<p>Miss Tang, a venereal disease! I already know everything about buying shoes for her, I even know that he's going to marry her, does he still need to use this method to show me at this time!</p>
<p>I really envy Miss Lian, although she dresses plainly and doesn't spend money lavishly, she doesn't rely on other people's money, she is free in everything, her body and everything else belongs to herself. Even if I get married in the future, I will advise her not to rely on her husband, but to do her own thing.</p>
<p>April 20th</p>
<p>These days, I've only been sick, and my belly is getting bigger day by day. Elder × is probably feeling that I'm haggard, and he hasn't even come back for several days in a row. No, it is said that he dislikes me for being old; people all say that women who get close to men too much often age in their youth.</p>
<p>It is men who play with women as if they were fox spirits, and it is also men who throw them away on the dark streets when they have played them out. It is said that Elder × is now going to marry a nineteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p>I think after the child is born, I am determined to go to Hangzhou to find Aunt Jiu, and ask her to introduce me to work in the obstetrics hospital to study nursing, or to go to women's supplementary school, or... In any case, I won't be Elder ×'s wife!</p>
<p>A man is tired of a woman, and her children probably won't be tired of her, the children are also born by him, not brought by the woman. Miss Lian told me to be more optimistic, women with children have nowhere to go; I want to solve this problem with Elder × before I leave, anyway, it's my own child, and I have the right to see it in the future!</p>
<p>April 25th</p>
<p>Mother Chen told me that yesterday Elder × told the old lady to persuade me to go to the hospital to live now. According to Dean Wang yesterday, my body is too bad; due to excessive mental labor, I am now in a state of "hysteria." Furthermore, pregnant women who have had uterine diseases are most afraid of miscarriage or premature birth.</p>
<p>Elder × also said that if I was unwilling to go to the hospital, he would ask the old lady to exaggerate my illness to me, saying that I needed to be isolated from others and have the quietest recuperation.</p>
<p>"Hysteria," an unsound uterus, I don't even know it myself, do I need people to exaggerate it to me so much? I most hope to go to the hospital one day earlier, to leave other people's homes! I even hope for a miscarriage, after a miscarriage, I can get rid of the burden of motherhood. Everyone knows that the most difficult thing for divorced women to live is to have children. Because children do not belong to the country or society, they belong to their parents, and if the feelings of the parents are broken, the children will not be unhappy, and those who care most about the children are mostly not the father, but the mother.</p>

<h3 id="e202">On Independence <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Ren</p>
<p>How can a person construct an interesting and noble life? This is truly a question worthy of people's interest to discuss. Of course, the life we are talking about here is not simply seeking material satisfaction as a complete hedonism, but a kind of enterprising spirit, a manly spirit, and a spirit of perseverance that can be followed by practice. In other words: a person should have a free spirit and an independent personality to make life meaningful.</p>
<p>At any period and in any region, we will never believe that there is no one as intelligent and capable as the great men or scholars who have left a deep impression on us in the past. However, in the end, they still walk on the path of degeneration, or seem to deliberately bring the cradle closer to the tomb, and disappear into the world in an instant, decaying with the grass. Why is it that people of the same opportunity, even people with the same wisdom, have such different distinctions? This is undoubtedly due to the lack of a spirit of advancement, a pure and noble heroic heart, and the characteristics and abilities to preserve the individual. Because a person must have the above three conditions in order to reach the most ideal state of any career or learning. However, to achieve these two conditions, the most important means is to summarize it in independence of thought and behavior.</p>
<p>The water in the sea or ocean, when analyzed, is formed by the collection of small drops. The world, this complex and vast society, is also created by the efforts of individuals. The great reforms in society today, all immortal truths, and various new inventions in the mechanical field, were initially just a plan in an individual's mind, a declaration on the lips, and a novel fantasy. However, later, these plans, declarations, and fantasies, after their multiple efforts and meticulous investigation, succeeded in becoming what is called truth today. This is to clearly tell you that dependence is the most meaningless waste in the world. Only by using your independent spirit to train yourself is the only way out for you to become an outstanding person. At the same time. We can also cite a good example here for comparison. Coleridge was a very strange person with uneven academic brains, but because he lacked the spirit of independence, he was forever trapped in fantasy and planning without practical achievements. I remember Lamb saying in a letter to his friend, "Coleridge is dead now! It is said that he left behind more than 40,000 articles on theology and logic, but none of them were finished." From this, it can be known that no matter how talented he is, if he lacks the courage to move forward independently, failure is still unavoidable.</p>
<p>Although, when it comes to independence, some people will associate it with being considered unrounded and unkind by people in society. Therefore, they think that independence is what madmen say; even if it is not, it must be the behavior of superhumans. So, for the sake of superficial life, they still float up and down with the flow. Obviously, this is a big mistake. Indeed, if the characteristics of an individual tend to be eccentric and cannot be independent in this world, it is naturally a more troublesome thing; however, today it is not necessary to overthink this item, but what should be overthought is that there are too many who are accustomed to being dependent.</p>
<p>Peter Si once said this way: "To be an unusual person, one must first have an independent spirit." Yes, as human beings, we should be like a high mountain standing against the wind, not like a grass that is blown by the wind. In this way, I think our lives will definitely produce infinite meaning from this unique spirit. At the same time, our ordinary lives can also be improved because of this.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Rural Women of the East River <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Guangling Correspondence from Guangdong</p>
<p>In rural villages, there are no fashionably dressed modern young ladies, nor are there wives with "sex toys." There are only simple, hardworking, and enduring farm women—the so-called "rural women," which implies labor. However, their labor is not limited to "household chores" (such as washing clothes, cooking, and raising children); they also plant vegetables, weed, harvest beans, and cut wheat... This situation is very common, the same in both the south and north of China. Therefore, the work of rural women is more complicated than that of farmers, and their lives are harder than those of men. However, in many places, women are hampered by the cruel custom of foot-binding, which prevents them from working in the icy fields or undertaking heavy tasks (such as carrying manure, pushing carts, and lifting stones), so they are essentially in an auxiliary position in agricultural work. But this situation is completely different in the East River region of Guangdong.</p>
<p>There, women can be said to be completely liberated physically: no foot-binding, no breast-binding. As a result, they are very strong and do the same work as men. At the same time, they not only perform well in their work, but they can also independently support their families and cope with society—they are good mothers to their children, strong farmers in the fields, and also "brokers" in trade. The saying that "women depend on men for a living" has been shattered by these facts!</p>
<p>This time, I followed the army to eastern Guangdong. The route went through the East River (via Huizhou, Heyuan, Laolong, Wuhua, Meixian, and on to Jiaoling). I passed through many villages and cities. After Huizhou, I saw women carrying loads, including grain and firewood. According to the locals, some were taking their own agricultural products to the market to sell, while others were small vendors specializing in buying and selling. This is a rare sight. Although women in other provinces carry grain to market, they usually only carry it on their backs or in their hands! Also, in markets elsewhere (especially in the north), most of the business is done by men. However, in the East River region, on market days (small markets are called "xu," held every three days), it is all crowded with women.</p>
<p>In this second month of the lunar calendar, it is the season for spring plowing. Along the way, I saw women harrowing the fields. They rolled up their sleeves high, tied their trousers around their thighs, and their healthy arms and smooth legs were naturally exposed. However, they were not trying to seduce men, but for the convenience and agility of their work.</p>
<p>Our troops walked all the way from Huizhou to Jiaoling (a county in eastern Guangdong), and most of the military supplies along the way were carried by women. They could carry at least six boxes of ammunition, each weighing more than ten pounds. They could travel more than sixty li (about 20 miles) a day with such a heavy load and still hurry home when they reached their destination. There are many mountains in the East River region, which makes carrying loads particularly difficult. However, their speed was no slower than that of the army. On level ground, they were simply being held back by our troops. This shows that women who have developed naturally are no more delicate or weak than men.</p>
<p>They carried their loads, mixed in with our "warriors," without any restraint or shyness. They understood that selling labor for food is a legitimate occupation and there is no need to display any pointless shame. So, along the way, there was laughter and talk. When climbing mountains, they sang mountain songs to dispel fatigue. As soon as one person started, everyone would sing in chorus. The singing was not as gentle or melodious as the "Peach Blossom River" sung by modern young ladies, but its strength and passion were exciting. Unfortunately, I was an outsider and could not understand the lyrics!</p>
<p>Their clothes were mostly short (just covering their hips) homespun shirts, with aprons hanging in front to wipe away sweat. They wore a cloth towel on their heads to shield them from the sun and light rain. Their trousers were also very short, and their bare feet were not protected by shoes or socks. In short, their dress was very primitive and simple. Of course, some were more fond of dressing up. Generally speaking, they wore grayish-white foreign cloth shirts, or skirts with embroidered edges, and had three headscarves: red, blue, and white. This dress was by no means fashionable, but on a young girl, it had a unique charm, and the protruding chest and slightly exposed breasts made her look healthier and more lovable.</p>
<p>Their food was also very coarse, almost entirely vegetables. Whenever they carried things for others and had to go more than a few tanglu (ten li is one "tang") away, they would prepare a pack of dry food at home to carry with them. When their stomachs were churning and their bodies were exhausted, they would put down their loads, wipe away their sweat, and swallow the cold food. If it was really hard to swallow, they would take out one or two cents to buy hot water to soak the rice (in Guangdong, a small copper coin is called "one cent," in the East River region it is called "one lei").</p>
<p>This kind of frugality seems excessive to us, but they have no choice! Because the result of selling their labor and sweat every day is, on average, no more than five or six jiao (a dime) of small foreign silver (carrying ammunition is two jiao per tanglu, but this is an exception). This small amount, in addition to maintaining their own necessary living expenses, also has to support their parents who cannot work, or their crying daughters. The heavy burden of the family is on their shoulders, what else can they do but be extra frugal?</p>
<p>Of the women who live this hard life, some still have a small amount of farmland. During the busy farming season, they cultivate their own fields, and when they have free time, they look for opportunities to sell their remaining labor. The rest are mostly hired laborers without land. Besides helping with odd jobs during the busy farming season, their main occupation is carrying goods. However, this occupation is not fixed. Like dockworkers in the city, they only have a livelihood when there is an opportunity to carry goods. So, they take their tools (thick bamboo poles) very early every day and wait on the main roads. When they meet an employer, they crowd around, scrambling for business.</p>
<p>Most of the reason why rural women in the East River region have to independently support their families and make a living is that men go out to do business or go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia) to work (the most overseas Chinese in Nanyang are from the East River and western Fujian). Regardless of whether they do business or work, they are very far away from their families. Many have lost contact altogether and do not take care of their families at all. I have asked many women whose husbands or fathers and brothers have been away from home for more than ten years, or seven or eight years, and they do not know whether they are alive or dead. But they have not given up hope for them, believing that they will eventually earn money and come back!</p>

<h3 id="e204">Chinese in Europe <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Xuewen</p>
<p>Marseille Correspondence from France</p>
<p>Among the Chinese living in Europe, if one were to rank them based on appearance, one could not simply use the same standards as in our homeland. Because a suit and leather shoes are the only marks that distinguish the upper-class Chinese and the middle-class intellectuals in our country, but among the Chinese living in Europe, since wearing a suit and leather shoes is universally the norm, at most one can only distinguish them by how fashionable they are, the quality of the materials, and how clean they are. Although one can usually see Chinese of various shapes and colors wearing work clothes, casual clothes, and formal clothes on the street, on Sundays, most of them wear fairly splendid casual clothes, with a cane hanging on their wrist, and some even have a Western woman in tow, appearing on the streets, streetcars, and in the countryside in the guise of a young gentleman.</p>
<p>The Chinese who reside in Europe, those top-level dignitaries, nobles, and idlers, can only be glimpsed occasionally when they visit some place or at some exhibition. They only appear at banquets, entertainment venues, and conference halls of the upper-class foreign society. So, we do not know what they do or how they live. Students, who are the main component of the Chinese in Europe, both self-funded and government-funded, with the exception of a small number, are either the children of wealthy families with very good financial situations, or they receive subsidies from the national or local government. So, even though they are still studying and do not have a lot of money to spend freely, they still live a more leisurely life than ordinary Chinese. Studying, we dare not deny everything, and some naturally work hard and are self-motivated, but there are also many who specialize in dancing, watching plays, and engaging in social interaction and love with foreign girls.</p>
<p>Merchants, this is a sad story. Like the large Chinese exporters, although they occasionally send resident managers and salesmen to Europe, they are very rare, and even if there are some, they are just a few travelers living in little-known hotels or renting single rooms. If you were to call them Zhuangke (retainers or followers), then putting them in the</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>large industrial and commercial cities of Europe, they are nothing more than brokers of the sixth, seventh, or eighth rank. Chinese merchants who open huge companies, foreign firms, and banks like Europeans do in China, renting or even building multi-story Western-style buildings as business premises, are not even to be seen. If you were to talk about business, then there are at most only three or five Chinese restaurants in major cities such as Marseille, Lyon, Paris, London, and Berlin, which are small like pigeon coops, and most of them only sell food to the Chinese, earning money from their own people to maintain their lives. Those who run these small businesses are Chinese workers who have been in Europe for a long time and have saved a few coins, hard-working students, and students, and are not considered formal merchants.</p>
<p>As for the lower-class Chinese in Europe, the components are more complex, and their origins and the ways they make a living are also uneven. In terms of their origins, most of them are Chinese workers recruited in China by the Allied Powers during the First World War, followed by the work-study students who came to France from 1919 to 1921. Although most of them have returned to China, many have stayed in Europe for a long time, especially in France. Naturally, there are also many who are scattered in Germany, Belgium, and other countries. It is said that the Chinese workers recruited during the Great War were initially under military management in England and France, either being driven to work behind the front lines, or helping them to produce in factories. But no matter where they were, they were housed in barracks specially set up by the War Department, working under military law. After work, they lived in one place, guarded by black soldiers, and could not go out freely. If there was anything unsatisfactory, they would be subject to military punishment. Flogging and imprisonment were common occurrences. In France, they were even taken to Marseille to be imprisoned in water prisons, or sent back to China. Their wages were so low that they could not be lower. In addition to food, they usually only received one-third of the ordinary wage as pocket money. Although the Chinese workers who received this treatment felt pain, they could not escape, because they did not have passports when they came to Europe. If they escaped, all hotels and residences would not dare to accommodate them. Occasionally, if they escaped, they would become blacklisted Chinese workers, and were in danger of being arrested at any time, so they could only sneak around. This situation continued until around 1924 before it improved. Those who did not want to return to China could obtain a residence permit and find work freely. When they were workers, they mostly relied on physical labor for hard work due to their lack of knowledge and lack of technical training. The wages were generally about one-fifth lower than those of workers in the country where they were located. Now, the Chinese workers who have stayed in Europe have some skills, and their living conditions are better than before. Some have also saved a little money by living a subhuman life, but it is not easy to send money back to China, and some have married Western women and started families. Most of them do not want to return to China.</p>
<p>The work-study students originally came to Europe with the grand ambition of studying through work, but this was just their fantasy at the time. After arriving in Europe, they lived a very pitiful life for a period of time during the post-war economic panic and unemployment panic. Some of them died from eating only foreign potatoes and getting bloated diseases, and some were so desperate that they passively committed suicide, but most of them have returned to China. Those who have stayed in Europe now have some skills and have completely become workers. However, because they were intellectuals in China, some of them have a good command of foreign languages, and some have studied and acquired considerable knowledge. Many of those who have stayed in Europe have also married and no longer think about returning to China.</p>
<p>There is also a group of small businessmen who wander around many cities in Europe, selling small trinkets to make a living. The things they sell are just small stone carvings of people, monkeys, cups, bowls, and other toys. Most of these people are from counties such as Qingtian.</p>
<p>Among all these lower-class Chinese, except for the work-study students, many of the components are not pure. For example, among the Chinese workers recruited in the European War, some were soldiers under Zhang Xun, and lost their jobs after his restoration plot failed, and were only recruited to foreign countries. Some had committed murder and robbery and used this opportunity to escape to foreign countries. As for those Chinese who came to Europe without formal recruitment, they were almost all smuggled in. On ships traveling between China and Europe, some were Chinese stewards and stokers, who not only smuggled arms, morphine, and opium, but also smuggled in such vagrants. Anyone who knows this route can come to Europe without a huge fare. If you can find a Chinese steward or stoker, just pay half or one-third of the lowest fare, and if they are their relatives and friends, you may not even have to pay. They will smuggle you into the stoker's cabin at the stern of the ship to sleep, eat with them, and when foreigners come to check, you can hide in the only exposed hole in the stern of the ship where the rudder is, and you can avoid everything. But there are also occasional discoveries, and being discovered is very dangerous. Sometimes the foreign masters will immediately push you into the sea.</p>
<p>Because some of these Chinese are people with extraordinary abilities, some of them also engage in the business of opium and morphine, and even after the war, some lived a life of theft and robbery, committing murder cases. Such Chinese are generally the most despised in Europe, although most Chinese are equally despised. Lower-class Chinese in Europe are simply a kind of yellow slave, no different from black slaves. Their misfortune does not become fortunate just because they have arrived in civilized Europe.</p>

<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>In 1880, the Viennese doctor Breuer cured a young woman suffering from hysteria by using hypnosis. This matter attracted the attention of the famous Freud, who immediately decided to study with Dr. Breuer, and as a result, the two jointly completed the book "Studies on Hysteria." Later, Freud continued his research and finally completed the famous theoretical system of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>The psychoanalysis completed by Freud not only showed its brilliance in general psychology and abnormal psychology, but was also applied to history, religion, and art. Generally, Freudians believe that psychoanalysis is omnipotent. In their eyes, all phenomena of human society can only be understood by studying them with the laws of psychoanalysis. Now, Freudianism is not only prevalent in Western Europe, but also has its followers in the relatively backward East Asia, Japan, and China. Kume Masao, in his famous book "Symbolism of Anguish," gave such publicity to psychoanalysis: "This theory (psychoanalysis) has influenced not only psychiatry, but also researchers in pedagogy and social problems. Because Freud also explained the psychology of wit, dreams, legends, and literary creation, there are now many people who apply this theory to literary criticism. Moreover, even strange new terms such as Freudian Romanticism have been heard." From this, it can be seen what an important position psychoanalysis occupies in the general academic world.</p>
<p>Freudianism mainly arises from the special emphasis on human sexual instincts. According to Freud, humans have sexual desires from birth, in infancy. The infant's sucking of milk and the infant's being held in its mother's warm embrace are all satisfying its sexual desires. Because humans have the behavior of loving the opposite sex, in the eyes of Freudians, boys must love their mothers and consider their fathers to be their rivals, and vice versa, daughters prefer their fathers. However, at a certain age, people's sexual desires and all their potential desires are restricted by ethics and morality, and some desires cannot be consciously and clearly expressed. Freud said, "Our unconscious realm is like a huge waiting room, in which various psychological tendencies are crowded together like organisms. This waiting room has a smaller room, like a guest room, connected to it. In this room, the same consciousness exists, but at the entrance from the waiting room to the guest room, there are guards who supervise various mental tendencies, checking them here. If they feel that something is wrong, they will not allow them to enter the guest room. ... Various tendencies are unconscious from the beginning. Because they are blocked by the guard at the entrance and return, they become conscious. At this time, we say that they are being repressed." However, this repressed desire does not disappear because it is repressed. When the conscious review is relaxed, it will revive and turn around, which constitutes bizarre dreams. At the same time, because under conscious review, many of humans' desires in infancy cannot be expressed clearly and directly, they are often excluded and symbolized in imagination. Thus, art, and even religion, history, and many social phenomena are produced. According to Freudians, the sticks and pencils made by humans are symbols of the male reproductive organs, and vases and other objects are symbols of the female reproductive organs. In their eyes, all our words and actions have an inseparable relationship with sexual desires, and even general political movements are only "expressions of the lewd desires of the infant and prehistoric times."</p>
<p>What is the value of such psychoanalysis? We will now give a brief critique of it. Naturally, we do not say, like Schopenhauer, that sexual love does not exist. In reality, sexual love occupies a very important position in life. However, exaggerating the importance of sexual love like Freudians do, saying that all phenomena in the human world have the closest relationship with human sexual desires, is excessive. Take art, for example. Because sexual love occupies a very important position in life, all sculptors, painters, poets, and novelists since ancient times have either taken love stories as the theme of their works, or interspersed some events related to sexual love. In order to increase the persuasive power of their works of art, the forms adopted by artists and the human language and actions used are often related to human sexual love. Sometimes it can even be said that they are issued by the artist's own sexual desires. Therefore, when studying works of art, applying psychoanalysis to analyze the sexual love life expressed by the writer and to analyze the writer's mind is not without help to us. However, humans not only have the instinct to reproduce, but also strive to survive. At the same time, needless to say, reproduction can only be carried out under the premise of being able to survive. Therefore, in the entire life of humans, there is not only sexual love. Social life for survival is the first meaning of life. The meaning of sexual love arises under this first meaning. Art is a reflection of human social life, so we must explain art through human social life. Psychoanalysis, which exaggerates the importance of sexual love, can only help our research, and cannot be used as the only basis for our research on art. Obviously, the sculptures that appeared in the hunting era depict many wild bison and deer that are closely related to human life at that time. If we study them from the perspective of psychoanalysis, what direct relationship do those sculpted wild bison and deer have with human sexual love? In the past feudal agricultural society of China, landscape paintings depicting plants and natural scenery were produced. From the perspective of psychoanalysts, what direct relationship do these landscape paintings have with sexual love? At the same time, even those works of art that take love stories as their theme cannot be understood solely by studying them with psychoanalysis. Because all human words and actions, even their psychology and subconscious, are strictly regulated by their social life, and their psychology and behavior of sexual love cannot be freely developed independently of this regulation. Therefore, the concepts and behaviors of sexual love of people living in various times and societies differ from each other due to their different lives. "For example, in Greece, we have Platonic love, in the Orphic era we have pastoral love, in the era of troubadours we have chivalrous love, in the era of Petrarch and Dante we have mystical love, and in the era of Rousseau, Chateaubriand, and Goethe we have romantic and sentimental love." (Ikowitz) Therefore, if we do not study those works of art that express the concepts and behaviors of love generated by various times and societies from a social perspective, wanting to completely explain them by borrowing psychoanalysis will inevitably be futile, and it is absolutely impossible to understand those works of art.</p>

<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>"Owed rent? When did we owe it?" It was like being hit on the head with a club, a sudden shock that shook me.</p>
<p>"What's the point of saying more? Afu! He just got back, let him rest a bit, okay?"</p>
<p>Looking at my mother's melancholy yet kind face, I felt an indescribable distress in my heart.</p>
<p>"Exactly how much rent do we owe? Is Master Wu so ruthless?" I glared fiercely at Afu.</p>
<p>"How much? I'm not sure, only the old lady knows," Afu said with a bitter face.</p>
<p>"I don't know how Master Wu calculates it either. I remember borrowing only three dan six dou of old rice from him this autumn. When it was being carried over, I even saw a lot of chaff mixed in. But when it came to calculating the money, suddenly it was forty yuan! Just now, Changgen said that your father pleaded with Master Wu for a long time, but he didn't even listen and insisted on forty yuan. I heard that your father is still at Master Wu's house. If he can't figure out a way to pay the rent, things will be bad when they go to the district office!"</p>
<p>"Three dan six dou of rice, for forty yuan?" I really couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>"Borrowing rice in town always involves adding interest," Afu interjected.</p>
<p>"Can't we find any other way to get the money at home?" Although I still had forty-odd yuan with me, thinking about the travel expenses I'd need soon to return to Shanghai, I couldn't help but ask my mother.</p>
<p>"You can't find any foreign money in the countryside these days. This morning, Changgen heard that Master Wu was pressing your father to pay off the rent, so he rushed back to discuss it with me. We took last year's sow and more than ten dan of turnips to town and only got seven yuan in cash. Ugh! A sow weighing over a hundred jin only sold for a little over five yuan. That's not even enough to cover the cost of her feed!" My mother shook her head and sighed.</p>
<p>"Right? We can't even count on having meat for the New Year!" Afu said indignantly.</p>
<p>"Afu! Can we still go to town tonight?"</p>
<p>"What for? Go to town tonight?" My mother asked me urgently.</p>
<p>"Tell Afu to take these forty yuan to pay Master Wu, so we can get Dad back. Isn't it time to 'send off the Kitchen God' tonight?" I took out forty green banknotes from my pocket and placed them on the table in front of my mother.</p>
<p>My mother and Afu, for a moment, were stunned into silence, as if I were a savior who had come to rescue my father.</p>
<p>"Go quickly! Go with Changgen, be careful on the road." Seeing the joy that had yet to recede from the corners of his mouth as he left, I couldn't help but give him some more instructions.</p>
<p>The next morning, I heard my father coughing in the ancestral hall. I hurriedly came out of my room and called out "Dad" but couldn't think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>My father had heard that I was back last night, so he wasn't surprised to see me this morning. He just acknowledged me with a long, drawn-out sound.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man's face was already accumulating wrinkles like those of an old man. The lines at the corners of his mouth were as deep as if cut by a knife, and a line of dry, white beard like a brush hung across his face, as he panted rapidly.</p>
<p>"Is everything settled with Master Wu?" I asked.</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped pacing, glanced at me with worried eyes, and then sluggishly resumed pacing. "What's settled? The forty yuan was given to him? Hmph! They don't care whether it's a drought or a flood, they just want their rent at the appointed time. You can talk until you're dry, but you can't get them to reduce the rent by even a fraction. These people are just too ruthless."</p>
<p>"Forget it, let's plant less this year; we'll just return Master Wu's fields to him."</p>
<p>"Hmph, hmph!" My father looked at me with a cold smile, and then said, "Child, you don't understand this. Master Wu's fields can't be returned. We are born with the fate of oxen, and we're destined to be trampled on. What else can we say this year? We can only hope that the heavens help us, and that the harvest will be good enough to give us a little extra grain. As long as we have a peaceful life, that's good enough. Alas!"</p>
<p>A New Year's Eve slipped away in forced laughter. After living in my hometown for less than a month, after being separated from it for five years, I felt so oppressed by the bleak environment that I no longer wanted to stay.</p>
<p>One morning, amidst the long faces and forced farewells of my family, I said goodbye to my hometown, a place from which I had been estranged for years. Afu carried my luggage ahead, walking quietly. Everyone had a layer of distress buried in their hearts, and no one spoke. After a while, when we arrived at the dock, Afu carried the luggage onto the boat and put it away before coming back down. He stood there on the shore, staring blankly. As the boat was about to leave the dock, I saw a bitter smile plastered on his face.</p>

<h3 id="e207">You Can't Ignore It <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>There was a student at a technical school who spent all day and night studying science, hoping to become a top-notch electrical engineer in the future. He didn't care about anything else, not national affairs, not world events. When someone talked about social science theories or practical social problems in front of him, he would find it annoying and want to say that the person was just bragging and had no real skills. In his view, only burying oneself in drawing blueprints was proper work, and only those who understood geometry, algebra, and electrical engineering had real skills; everything else was insignificant. Therefore, he did nothing but work hard at his studies, not even reading the newspaper. As he continued like this, his self-confidence grew day by day, and he absolutely believed that he could learn real skills and become a top-notch electrical engineer. Whenever someone asked him, "Mister, what do you plan to do after you graduate?" he would answer without hesitation, "Of course, become an electrical engineer!"</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, a disaster struck. China, which was doing fine, suddenly experienced a rural economic collapse and industrial and commercial decline. The land in the countryside that was producing money for our aspiring electrical engineer shriveled up. His family's shop in the city also had no buyers and was about to close down. So the old man at home wrote him an airmail letter saying that the family finances were strained and they could no longer support his tuition. After reading this letter, it was as if a huge bomb had exploded on top of his head. His hopes, his courage, and even his life were shattered. All the X, Ys in his head turned into balls of fire, spinning around him. He screamed and shouted, almost going insane!…</p>
<p>From this story, we can see that people living in a real society have an inseparable relationship with all the real social problems; they cannot ignore them. Although the technical school student who wanted to become an electrical engineer ignored the real social problems and only buried himself in studying, the real social problems came to bother him. Clearly, he didn't care about political and economic issues such as rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial decline, but rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial decline caused a fundamental problem with his tuition, driving him crazy and turning him into a madman! From this we can say that people living in a real society cannot ignore everything in that real society, no matter what.</p>
<p>If you still don't understand, then feel free to bring up a problem and discuss it with me. You might think that monks have already "seen through the illusions of the world," "entered the empty gate," and absolutely do not "think of the mortal world." That everything in real society has nothing to do with them, so they can ignore everything in real society. But the fact is completely opposite to what you imagine. For example, the monks in the major temples in Shanghai cannot have peace and quiet if they don't network with those gentlemen. Although they don't want to deal with the gentlemen, the gentlemen want to deal with them. More obviously, there are national laws, such as, following continues on the fifth page</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>laws protecting or confiscating temple property, which they especially cannot ignore. Furthermore, the changes in general social customs also have a great relationship with them. We know how prosperous the temples were in various places and how wealthy the monks were in various places during the flourishing period of Buddhism, but since the Xinhai Revolution, many temples have been turned into schools, and the monks have declined day by day. Although there are still temples and monks in existence now, they are not as prosperous as they used to be. From this, we can see that even monks who have "entered the empty gate" cannot ignore everything in real society. If we move the question from the world of monks to the "world of mortals," it becomes even clearer. Before the January 28th Incident, many compatriots living in Zhabei must have thought that they had no relationship with international politics and therefore did not care about international issues, but when the January 28th Incident broke out, the Japanese cannons destroyed their homes and all their property. Regardless of whether they were willing or not, they had to become refugees. Among the thousands of workers in the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, there may have been some who did not pay much attention to the economic aggression of imperialism against us, but recently the factory was auctioned off by HSBC Bank under the economic aggression of imperialism, and there is an imminent danger of unemployment. The film star Ruan Lingyu, who recently committed suicide, may not have usually cared about social morality, laws, and other issues, and may not have understood the principle of money devouring people, but after a love dispute occurred, she could not ignore it. Morality, law, and all the old forces attacked her together, finally making her unable to survive and committing suicide. Thus, can you still say that people living in a real society can ignore everything in real society? Of course not! Because if you ignore everything in real society, everything in real society will come to bother you, making you unable not to care about everything in real society: this can be illustrated in many of the facts mentioned above.</p>
<p>Because you live in a real society, the economic politics, laws morality, customs and practices of real society all have an inseparable relationship with your life. In fact, you cannot ignore everything in real society, so if you want to have a planned and meaningful life, you must bravely approach reality and understand everything about reality. Because you must understand reality in order to deal with reality in a planned way, otherwise reality will deal with you. Why did the Mister who wanted to become an electrical engineer go crazy after suffering a blow from reality? That is because he held the view of "ignoring everything" (the result of which is that he could not ignore it) and did not approach reality, and therefore did not understand reality. If he had paid close attention to all the real problems in China and understood the real Chinese society, he would not have gone crazy even if he lost his schooling, because understanding reality would have made him know how to deal with reality, and he would never have been dealt with by reality. Why did Ruan Lingyu commit suicide? That is also because she did not understand everything in real society and did not know how to resist the oppression of real society against her, so she was killed by real society. Therefore, we say that no matter what kind of person you are, whether you are in business, working, or editing, if you want to have a planned and meaningful life, and not just muddle through, you must seriously manage reality, understand reality, and thus become the master of reality and deal with reality freely.</p>

<h3 id="e210">A Disturbance Caused by a "Literary Salon" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>—A Debate on the Question of "Imitation and Creation"—</p>
<p>Spring, at dusk, in a small "literary salon" (Salons Literaires - "Salon"), a novelist was lying on a sofa smoking a cigarette, leisurely blowing out smoke rings of various sizes. A playwright was standing by the window, playing with his cane, staring blankly into the empty air. There were also two poets sitting in chairs, crossing their legs, reading their newly created poems in low but contented voices. The air in the living room was so quiet. Originally, these writers had gathered here specifically to recite their new works and to praise and criticize each other. But there was also a critic who participated in this "literary salon" who had not yet arrived, so their work could not officially begin immediately. Otherwise, our poets, playwright, and novelist would have long been reciting their masterpieces loudly and with exaggerated movements.</p>
<p>Our poets, playwright, and novelist were originally waiting for the critic to arrive before reciting their masterpieces, but unexpectedly the playwright standing by the window suddenly raised a question to the others. He said: "We often hear those literary theorists say: art is an imitation of life and nature. But some people also say that great works of art are entirely created by the genius or the writer himself. Which of these two is right?"</p>
<p>"Of course, it is the creation of genius!" the two poets answered in unison.</p>
<p>"Ridiculous! Without life and nature, what would a genius writer create?" The novelist stood up, his attitude very impolite.</p>
<p>Thus, the debate on the question officially began.</p>
<p>Poet A—Please don't be impatient! I don't want to talk about what life and nature is with you. I just want to ask you: why are there so many people in the world, but only a few genius poets and genius writers can create great works? Can you say that those works were not created by their unique genius? Also, everyone finds the bright moon lovely, but only a genius poet can describe her loveliness, while ordinary people cannot. Can you deny the great creative power of genius poets?…</p>
<p>Poet B—Take life, for example (he rushed to say before his companion finished), everyone in the world is living, but may I ask how many people understand life? The eyes of great genius writers are particularly sharp, and their emotions are particularly rich, so only they can deeply understand life, and only they can beautifully create life in works of art!</p>
<p>Novelist—You two have probably finished speaking. But, I'm sorry, I don't agree with your theory! It's true that among all human beings, only a few genius writers can create great works of art, but if there were no nature and life, could great geniuses create great works out of thin air? Therefore, great works are not created out of thin air by geniuses, but are the result of their truthfully imitating life and nature. Art is the imitation of life and nature, so the more truthful the writer's imitation of nature and life, the greater the work they create!</p>
<p>Poets A and B—Absurd!…</p>
<p>Playwright—Don't argue (he said as if trying to mediate a dispute). I don't have any preconceived notions. As I see it, you all seem to have reasons. …</p>
<p>At this moment, the doorbell rang. Then the critic walked in.</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you all waiting!" the newcomer said.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it!… We are now debating a question," the novelist said.</p>
<p>"Ah! What's the matter?"</p>
<p>Then the playwright, who claimed to have no preconceived notions, eagerly told the critic about the situation of their debate just now.</p>
<p>The critic's attitude seemed very calm. After listening to the playwright's words, he thought carefully for a while before saying: "This question is very interesting. I would also like to offer some opinions. …"</p>
<p>Playwright—Good, tell us!</p>
<p>Critic—Yes, I'll first talk about the creation of genius. Indeed, if there were no life, no great genius could create anything out of thin air. ("That's right!"—Novelist) We see that every great work expresses certain social thoughts and emotions. All social poems, social dramas, and social novels naturally describe certain social thoughts and emotions, and even those poems and lyrics that praise the wind and moon are an expression of social consciousness. Li Bai, Meng Haoran, and others' poems that sing the praises of nature all express the thoughts and feelings of a portion of people at that time. If a certain social thought and emotion did not exist in the era and society in which the genius lived, then he could not create that social thought and emotion out of thin air in his work. Goethe was a genius, but he could only write romantic poems and novels in his era, but he could not write new realist works. Li Bai and Du Fu were also geniuses, but they could only write regulated verse in the Tang Dynasty, but they could not write modern-style new poems. Why? Because that kind of thought did not exist in the era and society in which they lived. If thought is formed by human beings in their lives, then the genius writer's description of life can only describe the life that exists in his era and society, and cannot create out of thin air in his work a life that does not exist in his era and society. Therefore, rather than saying that great works are entirely the creation of genius, it is better to say that great works are the product of life and the product of society. …</p>
<p>Poet A—Here comes the sociological viewpoint again!…</p>
<p>Poet B—If great works are the product of society, then there's no use for genius!</p>
<p>Critic—Please don't quarrel, you two! I will also talk about the function of art and the role of writers in society in a while. Now, let me talk about the theory of imitation first. The idea that art is an imitation of life and nature comes from Aristotle, but it is also wrong. ("What?"—Novelist) It's wrong! If art is only an imitation of life and nature, and the more truthfully a work imitates, the greater it is, then the records in courtrooms would be the greatest works of literature, because they truthfully record a kind of human affairs, a kind of human life form. The photographs of people taken by photographers would also be the greatest paintings, because the people in the photos are exactly like the real people they photograph, which can be said to be the most truthful imitation. But no matter what, you can't say that courtroom records are literature, and you can't say that photography is painting! In fact, every writer has a complex brain, with certain thoughts, a certain worldview. His description of life is not an imitation in the manner of a photograph, but a description through his brain and his worldview. Therefore, a writer's creation of works is a description and reflection of social life in his brain. All works of art are artistic reflections of social life, not simple imitations.</p>
<p>Novelist—"Reflection," playing with new terms! Humph, humph! …</p>
<p>Critic—The problem is not something that can be concluded with "humph, humph," we need to argue with theory! … Now I want to talk about the role of writers and their works in society. It is true that great works are the product of society and the artistic reflection of social life, but precisely because works artistically reflect social life, they enable the general reader to know what the reflected social life is like after reading them. If a certain work truthfully reflects social life, then we can understand the truthfulness of social life after reading it, and thus determine our attitude toward life in our cognitive life. In this way, works of art have the function of guiding life and helping life, so although writers and their works are the product of society, they also have a counter-effect on society at the same time. Only in this counter-effect can a genius writer show his greatness.</p>
<p>Poet B—Here comes some kind of sophistry again!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The critic hadn't finished speaking, and the two poets and the novelist were very dissatisfied and began to argue with each other. So, in the end, the "literary salon" could only</p>
<p>couldn't be implemented, and from then on, the two poets and the novelist</p>
<p>They went to create their own "salons."</p>

<p>Spring clouds and human dreams are the most sentimental,</p>
<p>A fairy maiden descends into the mortal world,</p>
<p>Twelve golden hairpins gather together,</p>
<p>In the Grand View Garden, she is graceful,</p>
<p>Yi Hong Courtyard, Daoxiang Village,</p>
<p>A special villa is built for family visits,</p>
<p>Miaoyu practices in the nunnery,</p>
<p>Like a floating fairy surpassing Pengying,</p>
<p>Why is she called outside the fence,</p>
<p>The stream is clear at the Qinfang Weir,</p>
<p>Even fallen petals are afraid of being trampled,</p>
<p>More amorous than jade, a flower mound is created,</p>
<p>She meets the handsome young master of Yi Hong by chance,</p>
<p>Staring blankly at the scroll, lost in thought,</p>
<p>Secretly moved by the detailed Record of Meeting,</p>
<p>Envious of Yingying and Zhang Sheng,</p>
<p>When the imperial concubine catches a glimpse, it's hard to hide,</p>
<p>She takes it to read and is half amused and half angry,</p>
<p>Pretending to leave and report,</p>
<p>The young master respectfully accompanies and takes care,</p>
<p>The two are filled with endless affection,</p>
<p>Each has their own thoughts of yearning,</p>
<p>I'm afraid our feelings cannot be fully expressed.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Sound films created many new stars, but also destroyed many old ones. Emil Jannings, once considered the greatest actor, had to quietly return to Germany due to the popularity of sound films. Although he was born in Brooklyn, New York, his rough voice prevented him from gaining a foothold in the sound film era.</p>
<p>Numerous other film stars also declined due to the popularity of sound films, but there were many inconsistencies. One actress, Bessie Love, had been in the film industry since 1918, making her a veteran. However, she had become a figure of the past several years before sound films became popular. One of the common endings for film actors at that time was to join Broadway vaudeville troupes, so Bessie Love inevitably followed the precedent. But after joining the vaudeville troupe, she learned singing, dancing, and playing the ukulele. It so happened that MGM was about to produce "The Broadway Melody," and Bessie volunteered and became the lead actress in that blockbuster. After the film became popular, Bessie Love's name also rose to prominence.</p>
<p>Bebe Daniels' sudden transformation into a graceful singer was also a miracle in the history of sound films. She had kept her singing voice a secret beforehand, not letting anyone know. But she practiced diligently and worked hard, and on the first night of the film's premiere, even her closest friends were speechless. Conrad Nagel, because of his stage experience, also became a popular choice, and companies competed fiercely for him, even if he had four legs, the companies couldn't outrun each other. Betty Compson had gradually declined after starring in "The Miracle Man" and began making short films. But after sound films became popular, she was soon rediscovered and sought after.</p>
<p>Maurice Chevalier came from France and competed with Lawrence Tibbett for the top spot among singing and dancing stars. Warner obtained John Barrymore and took strict precautions to prevent him from being snatched away by other companies. New York stage stars, enticed by Hollywood's amazing salaries, all boarded the 20th Century Limited train westward. Many succeeded and stayed in the West for a long time. Many returned in disgrace, without even their original positions. They complained to everyone about the evils of Hollywood, but they didn't know that Hollywood itself had no good intentions; it only followed the likes and dislikes of the audience.</p>
<p>The beauty of actresses was no longer the only thing valued as it had been in the past. Actresses who remained popular from the silent film era to the sound film era included Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, and Joan Crawford. They all took the lead in the trend, quickly catching up and learning to speak their lines. Their determination determined their future. Success is the reward of effort.</p>
<p>Now we have reached the peak of sound films. Looking at recent famous films such as "Little Women," "Imitation of Life," "The Merry Widow," and "It Happened One Night," as well as the currently playing "The Old Maid," how can we find any flaws? Even the endless stream of musical films, although empty and ostentatious, are delicate, magnificent, and complete, with no flaws to be found in the details of the technique. Therefore, we cannot help but feel both surprised and fearful!</p>
<p>What comes after reaching the peak? Decline? That's right, reaching the peak is an end. But the art of film has not yet reached a point where it has an end. We are constantly seeking new and novel things. What will we have in the future? We can no longer discuss this, because this is a story, a history, not a song.</p>
<p>Half craft, half art, but it is acting for people to watch, based on human nature, to win the audience's joy or sorrow. The history of film is the world's most romantic story. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e216">Review of "The Mighty Barnum" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>The Mighty Barnum</p>
<p>—— Grand Theater ——</p>
<p>Some films are purely for commercial purposes, and we cannot find anything relevant in them. "The Mighty Barnum" is one of these works, and we simply cannot find a theme in it. If we say that it is satirizing businessmen and philistines, then in fact the philistines P.T. Barnum and Bailey here are the ones the audience sympathizes with. Conversely, there is no hint of satire, so what is the motivation for making this film?</p>
<p>Yes, this film may be very good commercially. For example, it not only puts beards on women's faces, children dress up as dwarves, and pretend to be mermaids, but also has tall people and fat women, all of which give people a sense of curiosity, like in a playground, although people also know that those are all fake costumes.</p>
<p>Here, it is just like selling "The Mighty Barnum", relying on the appeal of Wallace Beery and Adolphe Menjou. As for the two of them, they do have likeable personalities here, especially Wallace Beery, who plays Barnum and collects strange people behind his wife's back, which makes the audience laugh constantly. Yes, there are indeed people with such personalities in the world, who try every means to make a fortune, they regard selling "The Mighty Barnum" as a legitimate profession, they change from vagrants to gentlemen, but in front of real gentlemen, they inevitably make all kinds of jokes. However, Barnum is ultimately a person with conscience and emotion. When his wife and daughter leave, his beloved singer also leaves, and his business suffers a disastrous defeat, his pain of loss is indeed a very emotional expression.</p>
<p>However, on the whole, the content of this film is of course empty, and the form is not a particularly successful expression. The screenwriter or director can at most be said to be dutiful. For example, using subtitles to explain the plot is rare in the period of sound film development. Also, Barnum's banquet for guests is a joke, once and again is too much, and after the guests leave, there are still two more times, which simply destroys the atmosphere of sadness. From this, we can see that the director's technique is not very clever, but rather vulgar.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not saying that this film is of no interest. As mentioned earlier, from a business perspective, it is quite likely to be a box office success. As for the later climax, the big fire, and the stampede of wild animals, they are all very tense. But in the midst of the fire, the director allowed Barnum and Bailey, who was sleeping in a coffin, to speak calmly, which is too unreasonable.</p>
<p>The lead actor Wallace Beery, gave people the highest praise for his acting in "Viva Villa!". But in this film, apart from consistently making people laugh, there is no outstanding performance. If people hope to see acting as wonderful as in "Viva Villa!", then it may be difficult to get their wish!</p>
<h3 id="e217">Miscellaneous Notes on "Baboona" <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>"Baboona" — New Light Cinema</p>
<p>Three categories are formed in the popular films: one is made with trained animals, such as "Wild Beasts" and "Dragon Tiger Fight"; one is the "Tarzan" type, with humans and animals performing together; and the third type, like the first half of "Trader Horn" and this "Baboona", is purely based on the activities of animals in the wilderness.</p>
<p>"Baboona" is just like "Trader Horn", without a plot. The front only writes about the departure of the plane, from the dangerous peaks of the snowy Mount Kenya to Africa; then from the life of the soil, the singing and dancing and other scenes? It is explained that it has reached the interior: then it comes into contact with lions, rhinos and elephants and other parts of life, especially the introduction of baboons as an important part of the whole film.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this can only be regarded as an adventure news film, and it would be an overestimation to recognize it as a documentary. Because under the cameras of the authors Martin Johnson and his wife, the daily life of baboons and the like, the situation of feeding and educating small animals, and the struggle for survival, such as resisting leopards, are faithfully and relatively detailed. However, this record is not enough for scientific research analysis and system, and the introduction of lions, elephants, rhinos, etc. is also only partial and fragmented.</p>
<p>As for individual pictures, there are quite beautiful shots, and the efforts and loyalty of the authors are also obvious in many vivid and realistic places. But from the overall perspective of the whole film, it lacks Montage techniques too much. Not only are the irrelevant airplane scenes too long and too numerous, but the capture of animal life in general is also too sluggish. As for the slowness of the investigation, it also strengthens the atmosphere and mood of dullness.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, the photography technology has considerable achievements, and the fact that this film does not tend to be of low taste is also a more commendable advantage.</p>

<p>Yu Ying is a newcomer at Tianyi, only sixteen years old this year, very lively and innocent. She is friends with Chen Qixia, and recently officially joined Tianyi. When "Return" was filming on location, it was her turn. It is said that it was her "virgin camera"!</p>
<h3 id="e219">"Human Relations" to be Released Soon <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Li Pingqian's latest directorial work is "Human Relations," which has been renamed three times. This depicts the story of a coolie's family being scattered and displaced, experiencing all kinds of hardships. The protagonist is played by Gong Jianong, who is famous for his profound and thoughtful acting, and Zheng Xiaoqiu, who is good at playing the sons of wealthy families, along with Zhu Qiuhen, Xu Xinyuan, Xie Yunqing, Yuan Shaomei and others. Li Pingqian has always been particularly careful in allocating actors, so he can make the personalities and living environments of the actors and the characters in the play very consistent. "Human Relations" is particularly successful because of the appropriate allocation of actors. The film has now passed censorship and will be released at the New Light Theater soon.</p>

<p>— Tong Yun</p>
<p>Sherron stared and said, "Mr. Brown, why don't you edit a small newspaper? Then you could publish it, with the first violinist to perform on stage in a swimsuit, what need is there for music criticism?" Jem smiled slyly and said, "Ah, I only now realize that madam is an intellectual." Sherron said, "Regardless of whether I am an intellectual, have you forgotten your own business?" Jem said, "Then I must first ask you, what is your business?" Sherron shrugged her shoulders and said, "Oh... for these few months, first write some high-minded musical commentaries. This newspaper has never published any good commentaries. Then I want to try magazines, or edit one or two myself..."</p>
<p>The certainty in her tone startled Jem Brown, and made him angry. He coughed, raised his voice, and said, "For the sake of madam's even loftier career, I dare not keep you here, first, because I am unwilling for you to waste your precious time on our humble newspaper, and second, to avoid hindering your promising future." Sherron quickly said, "I don't care about any hindrances." Jem said, "But I am too concerned about your future, so I want to do a good deed today. Please go downstairs to see the cashier, and ask him to give you two weeks' salary, and say that you have been fired."</p>
<p>Sherron stood speechless. Her eyes widened, unable to believe that this person had actually fired her. But in a moment, she returned to normal. She stood up and said, "According to your ability to appreciate music, one day you will publish a photo of a swimming woman next to a large loudspeaker in your newspaper. Isn't that what your readers like to see?" Jem listened, but wasn't angry, and just nodded repeatedly, saying, "This business is really good. When you see the cashier, ask him to give you an additional five dollars as a bonus. This idea is too wonderful. Goodbye..." Sherron also said, "Goodbye," and walked out in a disgruntled manner.</p>
<p>That night was the first night of the "Double Gems of the Opera World" opening. James Brown was also among the crowd, but he didn't arrive until the second intermission. He had never watched a play from beginning to end, but he didn't care, because his intention was not really about the play itself. At this time, ladies and young ladies were wearing revealing, gorgeous evening gowns, and gentlemen were wearing dinner suits. During the intermission, everyone was mingling in the lobby. James stood in the crowd, thinking that in such a place, where so many people gathered together, there must be excellent news material, if only someone could find it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, before he could finish the thought, he had already seen four people walking side by side across from him. Patterson and his wife, Pennester, and Sharon Nagato. When he saw them, he involuntarily walked over. He was no longer a playgoer, but an active news reporter. He remembered that he had sworn to find out the truth about the Patterson case, so he dared not be negligent.</p>
<p>He greeted the banking magnate and his wife. His eyes couldn't help but glance repeatedly at the handsome man next to them, whose hair was combed so smoothly that flies couldn't land on it. He said, "Ha, Pennester, the last time I saw you was during the rowing race." He then turned to Sherron and said, "Miss Nagato, long time no see, since..." He grinned. Sherron continued, "Since this morning, when you fired me." He raised his head high, leaned on Pennester, and asked him for a cigarette. (To be continued)</p>
