<p>——爲防癆會進一解——</p>
<p>上海市中國防癆會。鑒於民族康健前途之可慮。特自本年度起。擬就實施防癆敎育。㈠對各小學兒童施種癆苗。㈡公開講演及無綫電播音。㈢爲防癆徵文。並定期擴大徵求會員、是誠針對我國民康健。下一普遍而具社會性之特殊運動也。夫我國自海禁開通以還。屢遭挫辱。政治經濟上。固缺乏積極有力之政策。而一般國民體力太弱。難勝國際間有形無形之激劇競爭。實爲其中要因之一。此乃吾人不能否認者也。</p>
<p>當世先進諸國。自西歐以至北美。其國民體格。大都壯健。平均壽命。逐年加長。四十以上乃入壯年時期。方起而負社會國家較重大責任。故其學識較爲精密。經歷亦多豐富。而對個人聲色狗馬等非理嗜好。尤能認識淸楚。於公於私。明晰分寸。自不致因一時衝動而遺誤國家。蓋體質健全之後。思維籌劃。始能週密。否則有心無力。徒勞形骸而已。我國人衰老較早。體力較弱之原因。操勞過度或自行戕賊者。究爲少數。非民族普遍之現象。其所以衰弱至此之主要原因。約如下述。</p>
<p>我國原爲農業國。近數十年來。各重要城市。雖日趨於工業化而社會經濟動力。仍在農村。而農村經濟頹敗。都市工業。不能消納過剩人口。原有市場。日益縮小。集全國經濟力之上海。市面蕭條。亦與內地各城市相似。多數國民窮乏。衣食且不克維持。最低限度之生活。尙不能保。則衛生等於紙上空談。養生送死之不暇。又有何力以從事於營養衛生。國民經濟力愈疲弱。則民衆體力愈老弱。此必然之結果也。歐洲各國負責人員。率在六十以上。其精力之强。思慮之深。較諸少壯初無稍遜而識見經歷。又有過之。以故國力向上發達。雖有危機。亦可以人力克服。我國則何如。上層人物。其體格康健。堪勝重任。不畏煩劇。而始終不倦怠者。實居少數。中層社會。亦多不克自振之現象。深可憂慮是國民康健爲今日之整個問題。非僅限於肺癆一項。或某種病態而已。</p>
<p>防癆爲增進康健之一道。喚起國民注意此類病症之預防。誠屬當今之要務。然國人如欲謀民族全部之康健。則必除注意於此一事外應從根本上着想。力求如何增加生產。提高整個國民經濟力。提高一般人生活上必須之知識使普通社會。均能養成整潔嚴肅之習慣。减少不合理之奢侈消費。布衣蔬食。處處合乎衛生。則國民體格。自必日趨健康。對於疾病侵來之抗力。亦可增加。吾人不觀近隣之日本乎。彼個人體質。非必强於吾也。日常消費。亦未見如何高貴而其國民康健。日有進境。今已逐漸脫離衰弱境地。而入於强健之途。吾人其速自警醒可也。</p>

<p>大⾓謂抱有斷然决心</p>
<p>國民非節食應付不可</p>
<p>（東京）貴族院本日上午十時半開會、對於國務大臣之演說開始審議、先由津村金舍登壇、其質問曰、廣田外相曾在臨時議會言明、對於美國亞里索那省排斥日人事件、採取相當辦法、然該地對日民之暴舉仍未絕跡、外務省對此態度如何、又據海軍當局謂、軍縮會議决裂後、不致發生建艦競爭、而外務省則謂、或有競爭亦未可知、當局此等不一致之言動、易使國民抱不安觀念、請問兩大臣之所見如何、</p>
<p>津村其次指摘日本空軍之不及列國、說明列國重工業之大部分係飛機製造工業、並力說日本飛機工業·製鐵工業·及汽車工業之必要後始下壇、</p>
<p>廣田外相最先答辯、謂亞里索那問題、因美國政府加以注意、最近已見好轉情形、關於中日關係、日本鑑於遠東和平之使命、努力使各國諒解眞意、日本外交之眞隋並非否認世界各國之密接關係、與萬邦親交爲最大方針、尤其與英美之國交更爲重要、至於軍縮問題、希望其圓滿成立、不應豫期决裂、而進行準備、收回俄國使權問題、因俄國對各國負有債務、不能分離日俄債權問題、謀其解决、</p>
<p>大⾓海相答辯稱、（前略）吾人深信日本所主張者均爲公正妥當、然倘有任意擴張軍備之國家、踢翻此項主張、則其志不在此而在彼、已甚明顯、是以吾人非抱有斷然之决心不可、或甚至有時縱令國民一致節食、亦非熱中於對策不可、然吾人不應導民於該項傾向、故處以非尙之苦心也、外務大臣熱心於外交工作者、此事亦其一因、是以今若假令軍縮會議談判破裂之際、應採取若何對策、對於此項質問、吾人亦决不可因有對策、而以談判破裂爲無關緊要、發生寗可破裂之誤會於天下、此事非努力避免不可、（中略）但假如華府與倫敦兩海約仍得繼續存在、則後年以降、亦當建造代艦、因此且需相當經費、吾人應在建造代艦之經費範圍以內、而求適合國情、俾便整頓實質之軍備、而期國防上可免不安之感耳、吾人現在反復聲明、在今日情形之下、吾人極應避免豫料軍縮會議之破裂、而發生種種議論、是所切盼者也云云、</p>

<p>—中日關係的檢討—</p>
<p>— 徐道鄰</p>
<p>（二）亞洲門羅主義的錯誤　吾人仔細觀察三年來日本的舉動，便知道日本人要以對外雄飛獨霸的企圖，渡過國內的難關，而第一步則要做到亞洲絕對支配者的地位，從而對內對外，時時發露其東亞門羅主義的抱負。但吾人終認爲一九三五年的今日，與一八二六年美國高唱門羅主義時代不同，不但時代不同而情形也絕不相同。因爲英國與法國彼時在美洲還沒有如何了不得的深切利害關係，加以地勢上遠隔重洋，彼時交通工具與技術沒有像今天這樣進步，所以任令美國人高唱美洲人之美洲而實際以一國支配兩大洲的政治與經濟，但事實上美國在現在也不得不放棄當時門羅主義的政策，現在日本如果爲便利控制中國而高唱亞洲門羅主義，則在中國尙未脫離次殖民地的地位以前，歐美諸國對中國是有錯綜複雜而且極深厚的政治和經濟利害關係，甚至在軍事上也有深切的影響的。日本此時欲排斥列國，以東亞人之東亞的口號而置中國於絕對支配之下，如此不僅美俄已敵視日本，歐洲諸國都要敵視日本，尤與英國利害極端相衝突，美國控制全美洲是與英國獨立戰爭以後而取得支配者的地位，日本的强大，則是受英國保育的結果，這是日本人，亦是英國人所不能忘的。今日本若悍然不顧，而以東亞主人自居，其結果非造成世界之上全是日本的敵人而不止。</p>
<p>（三）自造錯覺的錯誤　日本爲鼓勵鞭策其國民，統一其國內的輿情，從前旣以種種誇張不實的理由，指滿洲爲日本生命綫，九一八以後，更以日本生存受到威脅爲詞，辯解其侵略中國爲不得已，一面更向日本國民狂呼其空前國難，不思此種國難，即或有之，亦爲日本所自己製造的，如欲解除，易如反掌，只在日本心理一轉移之間。日本常指中國施行排日敎育，實際中國除叙述國恥歷史以來，並沒有如何深刻的排日敎育，而日本則自造錯覺，對其國民普及深刻排華的心理，幾乎要在每個日本少年與兒童的思想中注入「有中國即沒有日本」的心理，這樣爲達到一時國策之方便而製造普通深入的幻覺，必有極嚴重的後果。吾人就事實而論，日本如果眞正顧到其生存發展，照現在的做法，可說適得其反的。因日本如果不能整個消滅中國，使無一人之存留，則今日的悍然不顧，决不能如從　之滅亡朝鮮時代。朝鮮亡後至今三十年，然朝鮮人民今日猶不能說眞正歸屬於日本。現在對於中國，如其侵略到底，永久佔有滿洲，或再擴大範圍，一方面再以零星宰制的辦法，置中國於死地，則中國人民豈但三十年，即三百年亦不會忘却，如此在緊接近鄰的中國種下百世不解的深仇，這纔是日本百年存亡大計上的威脅。反之日本如果眞有自動更新國交的誠意，則日本國民生存上之困難問題，正不難於解决中日懸案，確立中日關係，保持東洋平和上謀取極合理的解决。中日兩國地理民族旣相接近，風俗習性亦略相似，祇看兩國國民通婚者家庭關係的美滿，以及中日普通商民間相與來往之親切融洽，可見本爲兄弟，無不可合作之理。日本維新時代自强自立的好例，給與中國覺醒國民以不少的鼓勵，日本在學術文化產業經濟各方面優越的成就，中國方面並不否認日本爲先進。中國今在復興建國時期，需要經濟文化之提携正感迫切，而日本人刻苦勤儉的習性，又適爲中國所易與合作。日本之所缺乏，在中國或見爲過剩，反之日本之所能供給，或適爲中國所需要，所以在經濟上言，兩國如眞能以平等互利相提携，兩國民族生存發展上之問題，便可以完全解决。平</p>
<p>心以思，實在沒有相阨相制以同趨絕滅的必要。（未完）</p>

<p>民國二十四年上海市政設施之方針</p>
<p>各位同志、今天是上海市一個最沉痛的紀念日、自一二八上海戰事到今天、已經三週年、在這三年內、幸賴地方人士的合作、與市政府同人共同的努力、使閘北·江灣·吳淞·眞茹·大塲·廟行一帶戰區、已先後恢復舊觀、雖閘北方面還沒有完全復興過來、但是地方人士與本府同人、現正在共同努力進行、其復興已不日可期、這是差可告慰的、</p>
<p>但是我們欣之餘、還應該從這次戰事所遺留給我們創痛的敎訓中、來深深的追究、我們所以遭此浩刦的原因、這當然是因爲我們國家的力量不充足的緣故、所以現在中央、昭示全國、要充實國力、要各地方的政府與人民共同努力、將國力建設充實起來、但是建設國力、任重道遠、人家是經過了一百數十年長期不斷的努力、才有今天這樣的富强、我們中國從今天起、才來建設國家、充實國力、如果我們仍顧着各國建設的程序、一步一步做去、那就要一百數十年後、才有各國今天這樣的富强、而到了一百數十年後、各國當然比我們又有進步、結果我們仍是落後、可知這種迂緩的道路、是走不通的、因爲在今日這種國際情勢之下、已不容許我們從容緩進、</p>
<p>所以總理告訴我們、要「迎頭趕上去、」如果我們中央與地方政府和全國四萬萬五千萬的同胞、能够共同一致、遵照總理「迎頭趕上去」的遺敎、來努力建設我們的國家、充實國家的力量、或者在十年八年以後、我們國家就會有轉機、</p>
<p>各位同志、我們大家是上海市服務、在市言市、今天我就拿上海來講、我們試以上海租界的建設、與上海市區的建設、作一個比較的觀察、上海租界的建設、有八九十年的歷史、這八九十年長時間、而有次序、又比較有計劃的租界建設所表示出來的成績、也不過如此而已、但是如果我們墨守成法、也循着他們迂緩的道路去做、即使要做到租界這樣建設、恐怕也要非費我們八九十年的工夫去做不可、豈非太不經濟、所以我們現在要建設本市、也一定要依照總理的遺敎、迎頭趕上去、才能事半功倍、上海是中國一個擁有三百四五十萬人口的最大都市、我們要建設上海第一要深悉上海所缺乏的是什麼、從前的人所不注意的、在什麼地方、而力謀補救、三年以來的上海市政建設、有幾個可以報告的特徵第一年我們適逢一二八戰役、我們的工作、大部份限於應付戰事、辦理戰區善後事宜、以及安定社會秩序等、第二年一方面努力於戰區的復興、一方面繼續努力於市中心區積極的建設、以及上海市政府大厦的落成、第三年就是去年、我們努力於文化建設、如圖書館、博物館、運動塲、體育館、游泳池、市立醫院等、種種建設的先後興工、雖有人批評我們、說這種建設、是可以從緩的、或則以爲應該建設於南市或閘北、這兩部份人的批評、都具有片面的理由、但是拿整個的上海來講、上海是中國最大的一個都市、有三百四五十萬人口的大都市、上述種種建設是應該有的、不但應該有、且早就應該有了、我們拿北平廣州南京等中國各大都市來說、北平今日不過有一百一二十萬人口、廣州不過一百萬左右的人口、靑島不過五十萬人口、天津亦不過四五十萬人口、南京也不過七十萬人口、但是上述各市、都早已有很大的圖書館和規模極大的運動塲、上海自名爲中國最大的都市、到今日圖書館祇有兩個、且規模甚小、一個在租界內、一個在南市文廟、運動塲亦祇有南市一個小小的體育塲、再講到醫院、綠上海有三百四五十萬人口的大都市、連一個市立醫院都沒有、上海全市的病牀、據統計報告、不到二千張、如果照外國公共衛生的設備、好像二十人、就應該有一張病牀、那麼上海三百四五十萬人口、這二千張病牀如何够用、據此而論、圖書館·博物館·運動塲·體育塲·市立醫院等、實爲目前上海所極需要的設備、至於所以要建設在市中心區的原因、自然是以通盤的市政建設計劃而定、凡是具有遠見的市政建設者、自能明瞭、也自能同意、而且現在市中心區的建設、公家與私人的投資、已達二三千萬元、可見市中心區的繁榮、非但是一種自然的趨勢、且又係最近可能的事實、這是本市最近三年來建設的槪要、</p>
<p>今　年是民國二十四年、繼往開來、我們市府同我、所應努力的方向、如何呢、關於此點、本人在今年元旦、已有一篇告市民書、刋於各報諒各位同志都已見及、今年我們的建設、槪括的說、有一個重要的特徵、就是一般人所向來忽視、而與大多數人民福利有關的社會建設、中國目前客觀的現象、是百廢待舉、但我們不能百綮俱舉、祇能謁其力之所及、每年定一個方針、按步就班的來做幾樣建設事業、所以去年市政設施的方針、是文化建設、今年則着重於社會建設、本市社會事業的建設、包括敎育建設在內、共可分六端、現在分別而簡要的報告如下、</p>
<p>㈠建築平民新村　上海市有十五萬乃至二十萬的同胞、是居住在和地獄一樣的草棚裏面、這貧民窟裏同胞、容易生亦容易死「死亡率比較大、不死的多有疾病、過着一種非人的生活、我們不忍坐視他們長此顚沛、我們必須要將他們從地獄中解救出來、不獨要將他們從地獄中解救出來、同進我們還要設法改善他們的生活、使他們也來過人的生活、第一·他們的住的問題、我們應該要首先來替他們解决、所以上海市政府同人今年的工作、第一就是要建築平民新村、以解决他們住的問題、現在全上海市的草棚、據粗糙的会计、大概有三萬、我們現在的計劃、擬先建築其百分之十、計共建造平民住所三千間、以五百間、爲一新村、每一新村、設一學校、這個學校、同時也爲平民聚會之處、每個新村內、還有一個簡單治療所、有一個小規模的托兒所、並闢一空地、供貧苦兒童遊玩、此外每一新村裏、還有一個公共的浴室、這個浴室是男女分開的、還有一個公共洗衣服的地方、這種種的設備、都是他們日常生活所不可缺少的、這樣一方面解决了他閃住的問題、同時還可以改善他們的生活、並且隨着平民生活的改善、其相因而至的效果、衛生、也可以藉此多得一層保障、因爲都市裏有害公共衛生的疾病之源、大都是在貧民窩、所以如果將這些貧民窩改善以後、我們整個都市的公共衛生、以及一般市民的健康、就可以有一個很安全的保障、故建築平民新村、是上海市政府今年社會建設中之第一重要事業、此爲我們同事所應共同努力的、（未完）</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廳盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>由他們再去逼　百　，一層壓一層，一層打一層，打到拿出錢　算事。張介去　　：這個辦法很毒，不怕找不出錢來。周有容道　：這倒不是現在發明的。前幾年，不是有軍隊喊着口號，不擾民，眞愛民嗎？　是他們想的法子。他們不擾民，把這行大罪，讓縣長云頂着。他們是離開西北了，這個好法子，還有人用。程志前笑道：周縣長就是這樣爽直有什麼全說出來。周有容道：西安是有國法的地方了，爲什麼不說出來？還有啦，他們逼我，我可不肯做，而且就是做，三天之內，也交不出兩萬欵子來的。好歹是一死，給老百姓抵上一陣罷。當時我就對我那個連長說，籌欵現在有財政專員，你們向他要，問不着我。你若怕交不了差，請你們司令來，財政專員也在這裏，我們三個人當面說。那連長大概自辦事以來，沒有碰到過這樣一個硬漢縣長，立刻恕火如焚，豎起拳頭就打。他一動手，帶來的幾個弟兄，又何必客氣，一擁而上，不分上中下，將我打得連呌哎喲的氣力都沒有。還是我身邊一個科長，大呌，你們打不得了，打死了縣長，對省裏怎樣交代？他們也許有訓練的，打縣長，只能打傷，不能打死。他們聽了這話才饒了我。我自此以後，就睡在床上兩個禮拜。在床上養傷的時候，我心裏想着，堂堂五尺之軀，到那裏不好找碗飯吃，何必受這樣的罪？又過了半個月，我才請假上省來。臨走，我還提心吊膽，怕他們扣留我呢。（一二四）</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>紅羊故事，卽已演諸氍毺，今更由新華影業公司攝成有聲影片，用以提倡民族精神，意甚善也。爰將予所知關於太平軍之瑣屑，述之以供談助。　　　太平軍之服色，爲研究舞台劇者所聚訟。普通大都以爲紅巾裹頭，身穿紅衣。或則謂太平軍之裹巾制服，皆尙黃色，四十年前　演之鐵公雞，亦爲黃包頭，以後則漸失其眞。然據平定粵寇紀略云：「賊中服色尙黃，僞王俱衣黃袍，　以龍，冠亦如之。僞侯以下，亦衣黃袍，僞指揮以下，則衣紅袍，其褂及半臂短後衣皆繡龍鳳，任意爲之，無定制。男女皆首纏長巾，雙拖至臀。僞旅師以上用黃，下則紅。或綢或布，悉聽·裏紅者多，故江淮間呼賊爲紅頭，其風帽亦用紅色。」觀此則共色者爲上級服，紅色者爲下級服，聚訟者可以釋然矣。</p>
<p>洪秀全旣定鼎江寗，召英吉利國匠人羅士，香港工人周彬，督造金銀餅六式，以與西洋各邦通買賣。大金餅五鎊，中金餅二鎊，小金餅一鎊，每鎊作大銀餅十枚，大銀餅一百仙，中銀餅五十仙，小銀餅二十仙，輕重大小，皆仿香港金銀餅而作。但金銀各餅，雖造而未能通行。蓋西洋各國以天國非正式之邦，一致拒用，洪天王一怒盡毀之。間有私留者，視爲至賓。有見之者云：面文爲太平天國，背文橫列金賓二篆文。又太平銅錢，面文爲太平天國，背文直列聖賓二正書，亦有橫列者。</p>
<p>太平軍中人物，往往以避諱故，改其初名。改用旣久，初名轉湮，爰錄之如下：李秀成初名以文，天王始改其名曰秀成。楊秀淸，初名嗣在經。韋昌輝，初名正。陳玉成初名丕成，天王嘉其功，始改其名曰玉成。曾添養初名天養，避天王諱，遂改天爲添，黃再興初名天申，亦以避天字，改名再興。曾鳳傳初名錦。黃益芸初名益雲，避南馮諱，改益芸。陳緝室初名七室。李俊良初名俊昌，避北韋諱，改其名曰俊良。盧賢㧞初名賢達，避石達開諱，改賢㧞。李來芳初名開芳，避翼石諱，文書稟報皆改其名曰來芳。李來勝初名開勝，避翼石諱改名。</p>

<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>說書是蘇州帶有大衆色彩的地方藝術，沿滬杭路的杭嘉湖三屬：以及滬寗路常州以下，更有太湖流域許多城鎭，都是光裕社名家活動的區域。</p>
<p>近一二年來，無綫電盛行，幾位光裕社頭兒腦兒，頂兒尖兒的人物，都捨掉了書塲，改往播音臺。只不過要有產有閒的階級，才置備得起無綫電收音機，至於鄉下茅草屋的小茶館裏，聚集了許多黃泥腿的鄉下人，靜悄悄地巷候着說書先生上臺，一塊醒木，一隻絃子，是安慰勞苦大衆的恩物；那裏的說書，才是大衆藝術，說書先生的報酬雖然菲薄，可是價値卻超出了專在播音臺上伺候有閒的太太小姐們的所謂說書名家。然而據說那些不曾成名，或是新近出師的，才肯去到小碼頭上彈唱或者開講，至於成了名的，是發誓不肯再跑碼頭的了</p>
<p>這一回，有機會在沼滬寗路的小碼頭上，啊了一趟書，彈唱的是玉蜻蜓，開講的是英烈傳。說書先生當然不是名家之流，况且不論大書小書，都十足帶着封建色彩；玉蜻蜓英烈傳自然逃不出時代的桎梧，然而描寫法華菴的尼姑，衝破了禮敎的藩籬，得到性的滿足，這在</p>
<p>當初是何等大膽？後半部敘述金張氏奪埠，說金張氏在蘇州有雌老虎的徽號，</p>
<p>這在當初男性中心的社會裏，不失爲替女性揚眉吐氣的一種豪舉。所以我以爲玉蜻蜓要是重新估價，委實比較不脫才子佳人窠臼的落金扇，和封建餘孽的珍珠塔等等要高的多　在上海，說玉蜻蜓的張雲亭，下了臺，好象風吹得倒；上了臺，卻精神抖擻，是藝術家的典型人物，我最歡喜聽他的書！</p>
<p>英烈傳不過是敘述明太祖開國的歷史，這種以殺戮爲威的專制魔君，並無崇拜的價値！不過就書論書，蔣一飛能够說的羅羅淸楚，比較穿揷一二時事，便算是「陰噱」的，就我個人眼光，覺得此勝於彼！</p>

<p>最後，就有人把我在太廟中的行動，一起去告訴了李蓮英。這個人當然是决不肯省事的！他就悄悄告訴太後道：「這一塲火是起得很古怪的！據說：皇上在祭奠的時候，竟學着外國兵的樣子，行了一個舉手禮，無怪老祖宗們要動氣了！」於是天亮後便勃然大怒起來，立刻將我很嚴厲的訓斥了一頓；好像這一次太廟的起火，全是我的過失。你道這不是笑話嗎？」</p>
<p>這一件事情我倒並不曾聽人說起過，但我也未便作什麼評斷，祇能以微笑作爲下塲的辦法。</p>
<p>太后的脾氣實在好算是非常古怪的！無論做什麼事情，總是免不掉要後悔的。伊雖然已聽信了那兩位欽天監的官員的話，决意把繼續東進的計劃打銷了，但伊內心上却萬分的渴慕着白山黑水間的景物，深深地懊悔不該多此一番推算；更懷疑他們的推算不一定是準確的，也許明天就是最吉利的日子，豈不白白地錯過了？然而伊那裏冒此大險（？）呢？就爲着伊旣不敢冐險捲進，又不能忘情於原定睥計劃，伊自己便大大的感到了一種不可形容的煩惱：又因伊一人的煩惱，而影響了合宮的人，使我們都感覺到極度的無聊和不安。整個的盛京古宮，已給一重憂鬱的空氣所籠罩住了；我想在我們回京之前，快樂的景象是不能再見到的了！（二三四）</p>

<p>上醫院的歷史可以分做兩個時期：第一是外人創癖時期，此時期中又包括「敎會設立」和「外人公立及租界辦」兩個段落；第二是國人自辦時期，它亦有兩個段落，前節是「公立」，後節是「市立」。</p>
<p>當上海開埠後，基督敎和天主敎的宣敎師在條約允許之下，紛紛地選了這兒來做傳敎的中心；同時開始了他們的醫藥事業，這是十分有益的輔助他們傳敎事務的進行，在另一意義上則是給此間傳來了一種新的公衆衛生的制度和方法。這一種由敎會舉辦的社會公益工作，旣成歷史上榮耀的記述，也爲民衆所不易忘記，那些常　在嘴唇上的名稱是：</p>
<p>仁濟醫院　一八四三年　倫敦離會設</p>
<p>Lｅｓｔｅｒ　Cｈｉｎｅｓｅ　Hｏｓｐｉｔａｌ　ｌａｔｅｒ　Sｈａｎｔｕｎｇ</p>
<p>Rｏａｄ　Hｏｓｐｉｔａｌ</p>
<p>同仁醫院　　一八六七年　美國聖公會設</p>
<p>Sｔ　Sｕｋｅ＇ｓ　Hｏｓｐｉｔａｌ</p>
<p>婦孺醫院　一八八五年　女公會設</p>
<p>Margaret　Williamson　Hospital</p>
<p>廣仁醫院　一九○三年　美國聖公會設</p>
<p>St．Elizabeth　Hospital</p>
<p>廣慈醫院　一九○四年　天主堂設</p>
<p>Hospital　St．Marie</p>
<p>仁濟醫院是上海的第一個醫院，它是倫敦會的敎士額頡Dr．Wm．Lockhar創始的。他在一八四三年就到上海來，住在城裏開始他的佈道工作，那時上海剛剛宣布開闢爲商埠，還沒有劃定外僑的居留區域。他的醫院起先是在南門，一八四六年遷至北城附郭處。一八四四年，他以每畝四十五元的代價買了現在山東路福州路以南的一帶地皮二十四畝，作爲倫敦會的中心，那裏的地價，現在是漲到規銀三萬五千兩一畝了。一八六一年，仁濟醫院始售去北門外房地，另在山東路建築醫院。這醫院做了許多的事情，使上海多數人都知道所謂「麥家圈」│這就是本地人對於倫敦會的稱呼。怎麼會把倫敦會呌做麥家圈呢？原因是西方到中國來的第一個新敎士是莫禮遜Dｒ．Mｏｒｒｉｓｏｎ本地人把莫字的音念作「麥」字，他們看見仁濟醫院那一圈地方成了敎士們集居的處所，所以呌做麥家圈。（註）這所醫院的管理權後來移給本埠社會組織的委員會，而倫敦會則供給醫生，護士，和職員，和保留傳敎的工作。它已經成爲公立兼宗敎性質的醫院了。</p>
<p>不久以前，它得到李斯德遺產基金項下助金二百萬兩，乃翻造最新式的醫院一所；英文院名亦由「山東路醫院」改爲「李斯德華人醫院」，以爲紀念。</p>
<p>同仁醫院的成立，也是一段呌人興奮的故事。初，有一位旅滬的美國女士，名希爾慈夫人Mrs．E．Sｈｉｃｌｄｓ，患了很厲害的目疾，謁基督敎某醫士求治，旣愈，醫士却酬，希女士乃捐美金百元，囑聖公會會吏湯藹禮Tｈｏｍｓｏｎ用之以濟貧民：湯與華敎士吳虹玉相商用法，吳說：「滬上貧民太多，救之實非百金所能勝任，假如我們把這百元用作醫藥費，以救貧且病者，豈不較好？」湯擊掌稱善，因此租屋一所，月出租金六元，作爲藥房，一時當地外藉醫生，羣至該藥房施診。吳虹玉則於行敎之暇，勸募醫院基金，因使這小規模的藥房不致半途而廢，並且能有餘欵積貯：剛巧虹口一帶有以老屋十三間求售者，吳湯就把它買下了，併作十一楹，而「同仁醫院」的牌子也就在此際題了上去，時距草創已數年了。</p>

<p>自由談作家的誠實  季　　作家要忠實地描寫現實，固然有賴於準確的世界觀和對現實的綿密深刻的研究，但作家主觀的誠實却也是一個不可缺少的條件，作家能够達到客觀現實之眞實的反映，就全靠在觀察和研究現實的時候，他被活生生的現實肉迫着，不能說一句謊話出來。凡是偉大的作家都是不肯說謊話的。　　屠格𣵀夫說：「正確地，强力地再現生活的眞實和現實！！這，就是在眞實和自己的愛好不合致的塲合中、對於文學者也是最高的幸福」。能够領會這種最高的幸福的、恐怕祇有最誠實的藝術家吧。　　然而在必須說謊，必須隱蔽現實的階層統治着的社會裏，說眞話是不被允許的，作家常常爲了他的誠實而受到處罰和迫害。「社會的物質上的支配的勢力同時也是精神上的支配的勢力。」所以許多作家不是安於　Status　quo，努力去粉飾太平，便是迴避現實，沉溺在「說謊的頹廢」裏。祇有不受威脅利誘的作家纔能澈底地表現社會現實的眞實，指摘社會的一切罪惡和缺點。這不但需要誠實，而且還得有所謂「眞正的藝術家的勇氣」纔行。假若沒有這勇氣，他也許不能忍受因爲自已的誠實而招來的僞善者們的嘲罵，而終於在自己所揭發出來的醜惡的現實之前發抖，退縮。郭歌爾便是一個最好的例子。　　郭歌爾在「死靈」裏用無比的諷刺曝露了地主官僚的本相，說出了農奴制時代的「單純的，可怕的眞理」。本來是眞正的守舊黨的郭歌爾，在那時批評家的猛烈攻擊之下，看了自已所描寫出來的眞實。連自己也給驚駭了，他本是擁護尼古拉一世的制度的，現在却變成破壞這個制度的罪人了。於是他百方辯解，以圖消除自己的「罪孽」。他繼續寫「死靈」第二卷，極力想把俄國理想化。這樣，他就漸漸墮入了俗惡的虛僞的泥沼。但是作爲一個誠實的作家的他是到底不願意說謊的，他在他晚年的疾病和瘋狂狀態中，把「死靈」第二卷的原稿燒燬了不少，所以至今殘缺不全。這燒燬是有意義的，牠昭示了現實主義不能容忍虛僞和說謊。　　獵人（上）  時玳　　傍天亮殺了風　　托果那賴哈醒來，太陽已經爬上了半邊子蒙古包。揉揉眼爬起來，臉上暴露着焦急！連平常最習慣的伸腰打哈欠也顧不得了，胡亂的穿上羊皮長衣，綑上腰帶就去拿槍。這當兒，托果那賴哈的媽媽，正在煨駱駝肉，手里抓着馬糞往火裏加，她見了兒子急急忙忙的樣子，心里有點疑怪，往常睡到天㫾還不願起來，今天却這麼早就不睡了？一定有什麼勾當：　　│托果那賴哈│你幹嗎這麼慌里慌張的？　　說話間托果賴哈早就背上了獵槍，嘴里抽着烟，正預備要走：　　│昨兒匝明布留肯跟我定規好了，今天一早到古爾班揷汗嶺去打那隻花臉豹………，話沒說完，撒腿便跑。他媽媽也跟着跑出蒙古包，尖厲的呌着：　　│托果那賴哈！托果那賴哈！還沒拜佛就走了嗎？　　不拜佛就出去打獵管保得空着手兒回來，托果那賴哈立刻折身回來，把牛骨菸袋和皮菸包揷在皮腰帶上，恭恭敬敬的跪倒佛台前虔誠的祈禱着：　　│吉利門得！　　媽拿一些羊乳酒來呌托果那賴哈喝點，暖暖身子。托果那賴哈那顧得這樣那樣，爬起來，轉身就往蒙古包外跑，他媽後面跟着跑出來亂嚷亂叫：　　│不吃點東西就出去嗎？　　托果那賴哈騎着馬早跑去多遠了，馬如飛一般，一霎眼就過了鄂博奈河。自己喘口粗氣走回蒙古包里：　　│發瘋了，連我的話也不聽。　　×　×　×　　太陽光微弱無力的撒在雪地上白茫茫的平原，閃着亮津津的光。托果那賴哈心里越焦急，趆覺得太陽走得太快，眼看時間就要過去。馬如飛鳥一般，在雪地上奔馳，托果那賴哈竭盡目力的探望着面前│古爾班揷汗嶺。　　談愛  斐兒　　生平曾領受了幾種式樣的愛；也曾付出了同等的愛。在複雜錯綜的現社會情形之下，人間之網把我纏繞着：迫我前進，使我後退：絆着脚跟使我不能走路，或者吹着號筒使我衝鋒。　　够了吧，熱血是會在社會的冬天凍結的，情熱是會在人間的沙漠冷却的。愛使我疲倦；生活是會使我向前跋涉的。　　母親是六十幾歲的人了。回家的時候，她在我的耳邊喃喃地說：　　「兒呵！母親是將就木的人了。替我討個媳婦，使一生愛你的母親有個快樂的日子吧。」　　而父親，却永遠將他的熱愛藏在端嚴的面孔底下，說：　　「你永遠在各處流蕩，爲的是什麼呢？││人都應該有個家啊！」　　在南荒，朋友們利用着金子對我寄着厚望：　　「你，前途無量呵！」，被纏在小孩子羣中三年，小孩子的天眞底無邪之愛，使我險些兒把現實的世相忘記了。　　却在血腥的混亂中，使我對貧苦的人羣發生熱愛。貧苦的人羣固然仍在貧苦中，而愛却變成創傷了。　　綠色的光輝曾指示給我以世界和平之路。牠敎給我以「人類之愛」，說：「人間也有愛的」。然而，當世界是在「大魚吞小魚」的時光，我知道：人間是沒有愛的；愛是在將來，或者便是最近的將來。　　現然，却是一個樸實而純眞的小妹妹把愛來纏住我了：而大疊的書本子，也曾敎了我各種各色的愛。　　然而隔膜的愛與欺騙的愛，對我是沒有用處的。人是二十世紀的四十年代的人，心是已經從各種各式的愛中弄成百孔千瘡了。緊張而熱烈的愛使我心情麻木，而疲倦的愛，會拖我向虛無底黑洞里去的。　　讓我掙脫這些纏繞在我心上的愛的繩索吧！讓我有個獨自奮鬥的自由的天地吧！　　家，這個臭殼子讓給撕破吧！朋友們的希望，讓給破滅吧！我已經不是小孩子了；而貧苦的人們經了一回苦鬥，是會爬起頭來的。小妹妹請勿纏住我的脚；而綠色的光輝是會在赤紅的血汚中洗滅的。　　書本子中的愛，讓牠腐朽吧！那些陳腐的古物，在大風浪的狂潮中，是會一朝風化的。　　我也有個愛，那是：社會的進展會敎給我的，生活的進展會敎給我的。對於現實的愛，黑暗的道路會顯示個光明的未來的。　　終極，整個的人類終是可愛的呀！　　小品與科學  稜磨　　學科學的人視文字爲末技，確也是的，無論怎樣好的書，總不能使人直接從其中得到科學的理解，而終于只是實騐室的補助品。便就爲科學宣傳說，因在實騐室發生興趣而走向科學的人，也遠比由書本引起興趣的爲多。科學敎育的不發達，實騐室的辦理不善是主要的原因，敎科書的好不好幷無多大的責任可負。　　科學的敎科書總是那樣死板板的，一方面那樣較容易眞確，別方面，科學的活潑生命，自有其表現的所在，傳達到文字上轉是多餘，幷且現有的文字，也不够盡量傳達。要我們以一篇文字描寫出燃燒着的炭，鈣，氖的光是怎樣不同是很麻煩的，而我們看到，却可以在看到的一瞬間獲得很豐富的印象。所以我們在能窺視科學的生命時，對於科學書的死板板是無甚遺憾的。　　抽象地說，科學現象是隨時隨地都有，而我們日常都不乏觀察的機會。可是這旣不似實騐室內人造的那樣列有秩序，非慣於作科學的思索的人就不免都忽視過去。或者縱未忽視而也無處著手思索。就使是很讀過些基本的科學書的，也不一定能把整齊的韻律，譯成散文。　　散文不一定就是淺顯的文字，一本通俗的科學書，也許該比之一首兒歌，而幷不帶散文性質。反之一本錯綜根究科學的深淵的書，都很可以是散文的。現在我們已時常可以接觸到這樣的書，這種書的領導我們向科學去，其方法是從深處出，而不是從淺處八。不過我們讀過後，不一定能由朦朧漸入淸晰，有時我們所得的會終于只是一個朦朧。　　但在朦朧裏有時我們可以見到一瞥閃光。遇到這樣的境界，我們如讀到一篇小品文，而所謂科學小品文，大槪也正只能形成這樣的境界。要科學小品文負更大的使命，恐怕是奢望，因爲所探愈深，也許反增加朦朧的。　　　祭灶關  莫孚　　在鄉村間，每當踏進十月門，挾着賬本布袋的討賬人便隨時可以在街頭巷尾碰到。然而不渡過二十三日的「祭灶關」，畢竟還不大像「大年夜」。　　老早，孩子們都在哼着││　　二十三祭灶關，　　二十四掃房舍，　　二十五拐豆腐，　　二十六蒸饅頭，　　二十七去趕集，　　二十八神棚搭，　　二十九一格扭，　　三十　蹄，　　大年五更厥屁股。　　的歌曲。他们期待祭灶的心切，是超過「大年夜」的。　　前兩天，街上便有担着上寫某某糖坊字樣的木箱高聲叫賣祭灶糖。就是最窮因的人家，這時也要化九個制錢││現在怕九個銅板也不成了││買三根小芝蔴糖，祭奠他們的灶爺。據說是因爲怕灶爺到天宮去對玉皇大帝多嘴，透過人世間奢華的風，以至激怒玉皇，而降禍人間。在有錢的人家尙可說，可是他們那些連飯都窮得沒吃的，難道是怕透露人世間窮苦的風，降福給他們嗎？　　我家照例按人頭每人一根芝蔴糖。當天就準備好。一到夜晚，孩子的我們便坐不住了。私自分配工作，前前後後的跑着。牽馬││捉公鷄││的是哥哥。我只能去準備草料。默默地找到柳條編的升。到喂牲口院抓草，上空洞的，常常使人感到害怕的樓上取黑豆。有一次我爲避免上樓只弄了一些麩在草里，被伯父發現，便笑着叱責我。　　「不要學懶」，他說：「重去弄大料││黑豆││若不給馬大料吃，初一五更咱家灶爺趕不回來，可得等他」。　　我們雖明白這是句笑話，心里却還有些怕當眞如此。由哥哥伴着我上樓去，因爲我不肯把自己應有的權利白白讓予別人。　　上過香，洒酒到公鷄頭上，以至牠「撲拉」幾下，伯父說聲「領啦」，方纔算完畢。仍由哥哥將馬牽進槽││送鷄入塒││大家在輝煌的燭光之下，𨂃跳着，時時眺望擺在供桌上的糖，眼巴巴急得嘴裏流水。道個時候，時間大約是故意走得很慢。　　「還不到嗎」？　　我們輪流着這樣訽問特爲看守那一盤糖，坐在那兒抽烟的伯父。回答的老是：「不哩，再等會」。　　事實上，我們早已把芝蔴糖都吃厭了。只因爲那不是「祭灶糖，」而「祭灶糖」每年只有一根，覺得保貴。　　一年中有這樣的心情的時會，還有一次，是中秋節的「願月」同樣也是在夜晚。若細說起來，牠們是有極顯著的差別││「願月」，特分食月餅之後，一股腦兒把牠吃光，便安安生生睡一夜好覺，第二天又是平常日子。一切都隨着月餅的被吃而完結了。而祭灶却正相反是「大年夜」的開始。從第二天起，將更迫近新年，更熱鬧。要拐豆腐，要……按着歌曲兒件件都來了。　　自中學最後一年起，計算着到現在已有六個年頭沒曾參加這種祭祀了。据說這天灶公要點騐人口，的所以若非不得已，是不肯輕意被「祭」在外邊的。這也是鄉人的忌諱之一。　　這六年中，有一次我在家中，前一日母親還對我說：「今年祭灶可要把你祭在家里了。」不料第二天却不過友人的邀請，又到在一般傳說頗有點可怕的山中去了。惹得母親老大的不高興。　　「……又要給祭在外邊了，又要……」　　那次終還在「三十」夜間趕回到家，算個補償。　　現在第七個「祭灶關」又來了，母親自然還少不得要抱怨。　　吃飯（一）  周文　　太陽，正正地嵌在那燒焦似的紫色的天空，圓圓的，紅得像熊熊的一團火球，對着饑俄的眼睛就像洒下來一大把無情的鋼針。心裏想：這十二點該吃飯的時候了。　　「抬着頭幹甚麼１」　　聽見隊長這麼叫喊一聲，我又只好避開太陽的光望着前面走着的軍帽　了。眼睛黑了一下亮了回來，我才發現前面那軍帽簷下一根粗大的後頸窩，很滑稽，幾十顆亮晶晶的鹽顆子就在那短的黑髪邊閃爍着。他的頸子似乎已沒有先前那麼挺直，似乎也很餓的樣子了。　　本來在剛剛吃了早飯排着隊子來到這城牆邊的大操塲時，太陽不過還在城頭樹梢的那面，操塲外圍的草地還有着一些露水珠兒在那些草葉上凉晶晶地蒸發起來，我們又正是吃飽的時候，無論是正步，或者跑步，在那種斜射過來的黃光下，大家並不在乎，一個個都扳着紅銅色的臉，甩着紅銅色的手，提着紅銅色的脚板，一步一步重重地踏在那踏得不能生草的硬黃的地上，只聽見一斬齊的一步接一步的聲音。即使步子稍微亂一下，只要隊長喊一聲：「沒的吃飽麼！」我們的步子也就會馬上紥緊，聚精會神地連呼吸都好像收歛得乾乾淨淨，讓太陽在頭上晒着，讓黃色的灰塵衝上臉來，讓汗衣象泉水一般把一層灰土布軍衣濕透，讓脚步隨着口令「左彎」，「右彎」，拖着像蛇一樣的隊子，在沒有草的範圍以內無窮地一轉又一轉的前進。這前進，如果你是站在城牆上邊看，你就會覺到這恰像熱鍋上的螞蟻似的。　　可是現在太陽是到了正中，從前面的這一個後頸窩漸漸幹了變成　顆子的汗水看來，時間的確是是十二點鐘，旁邊同學的肚子的呌聲，和我肚子的叫聲，這就更加證明無疑。不但這樣，下面也在脹了。老實說，這確確實實是到了很需要吃飯和拉屎的時候。　　好容易挨到吹着收操號，大家才好像得到大大赦一般，那輕鬆，恐怕鄉下人放下幾百斤担子時的情景也不過如是，肚子的呌也親切了一切，把槍在槍械室魚貫地擱好，走到食堂前，看見一排一排的長掉上已經擺好了盌筷，心頭就非常快活了。　　我們的這個大食堂是和集合塲相連的。食堂裏面很整齊地擺着幾十張長棹，一排一排地和講堂上的形式差不多，集合塲的太陽光線反射進去，淸楚地可以看見每條長棹上的靑花盌都在發光，牠們在對着我們笑嘻嘻呢。幾個伙夫正在那兒找着兩大桶的飯和兩大桶的米湯出來，擺在食堂的當中蓋子　揭開，熱騰騰的白氣就像烟霧似的從桶的口　了出來，我們坐在離牠幾丈遠的杠架旁邊都聞着飯的臭味，的確，就要吃飯了。　　這是候，我正偷偷地躱在杠架的方柱旁邊抽着半枝在袋子裏面癟了的香烟。「飽吃檳榔餓吃烟」，如果這句话對，那麼我就該抽烟的時候了。可是一個同學却在旁邊閃着灼灼的眼光，挨進來了。哈，不對；抽我的。他却裝出沒有那回事似的，拍着我的肩膀問起來了：</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言競爭生育獎金  環聲　　報載美國多倫多甘尼女士現正與巴那都夫人競爭密勒氏之生育獎金。此競爭於一九二六年開始，在此八年中甘尼女士業已舉十一孩，　而巴那都夫人則已產九孩云云。　　這一消息在我們的東方文化論者聽了，一定高興，因爲我國舊文化影響之下，素來都把「多福多壽多男子」的三多，看得十二分的吉祥，喜慶，美國也來獎勵多生小孩，至少是吾道不孤，堪稱同志。我想咱們以「兒孫繞膝」爲光榮的人士，到無妨凖備聯絡國際感情，送上一個「茂衍螽斯」的扁額。　　中國的文化如果要與歐美媲美，在這此方面到確是當仁不讓，毫無愧意。因爲在宗法社會的大家庭制度下，能够多多的生兒育女，差不多已經成了一種「民族精神」，不僅一般人引爲光榮，而且許多文人學士都一致的加以贊美，譬如兄弟多，大家都歌頌幾句竹苞松茂，蘭桂騰芳，家庭兒女多，又說上甚麼德比嗣氏。因此文王之有八十九兄弟，就一直令人羨慕，贊美。　　這種功猷所及，所造成社會上的家族主義的發揮。實在不可想及。兄弟，叔姪，姑表，姨戚，種種攀親附葛的行爲。在社會上無數趨炎附勢之「物以類聚」的結合，幾乎全部的來講究這一生殖器關係。以前的人，在上者，皇親國戚，威勢無與倫比，其實在下面的聯姻通家，都拿着生殖器來聯絡人們，培植勢力，又何嘗不是如此。這一點也許就是許多人要姨太太蓄小星的根據，而婦女唯一天職在敎養口號爲重新提出來，想來也就是一個道理。　　但是古人說，養生送死無憾，王道之始也，足見對於我們民族的繁榮，不僅在多生，還要生而能養，以至於送死無憾。因之除了提倡「兒童幸福」之外還得想法謀成人幸福，以至死人的幸福（送死無憾）。所謂十年生聚，十年敎訓，也得是生聚敎訓起來使他們吃飯，不好說是爲的喝西北風。但是近年來內憂外患，天災人禍，弄和來許多人　妻賣子，易子而食，鷄狗一般的死去，旣已嫌養生之不易，何能辦到美國那樣的競爭生育，老實說，在餓生凍死，自殺被殺已成爲普遍現象的現在，一方面在競爭，一方面已是在獎勵死。　　這是我們關心民族復興國家繁榮所未了解的問題。難得糊塗  文　　學校裏放了寒假，我們也居然和學生們一樣的輕快起來了，有兩星期的假期好玩。可是還玩不上一星期，偶爾碰着同事，却把「哈哈，今天天氣好，」的老調改換了「放假反不如辦公的好，玩得眞無聊！」確實的，玩得眞無聊，手邊沒有多　　　　　　　　　　　　　八年來逛得够了，眞是無聊，自昨日起，乃改變方式，和××君關起門一間坐在房裏，專門談天談地，從吳稚老說的日本的毛厠上可以下圍棋談到人生的究竟爲止，得四字焉：「難得糊塗。」　　我彷彿記得這一句話是鄭板橋氏的名言，並且曾經在那一位朋友家裏見過他寫的一幅橫額，下面還有幾句批語，可惜健忘的我，一句也記不清楚了。　　人，當眞是「難得糊塗」，只要「糊塗「，就有辦法，就能「愜愜意」飛黃騰達，一生受用不盡，卽退一萬步　，也必心廣體胖，精神上安適得多。　　××君是久經滄海的一員，不佞也曾受過多少磨難，但到現在還是淸風兩袖，不，連生活都還沒有保障，捧着一隻够低下的飯盌，尚是惴惴然「朝不保夕」這不是我們的才學特弱的原故，而是未諳「糊塗」，不肯「湖塗」。就比方在職務上，往往是應付得過於聰明，以致不以爲德，反以爲仇，得罪了上司，於是吃起「排頭」來。在待人接物上，也是這麼着，一言以蔽之曰吃虧於不「糊塗」。　　××君常時說，他有多少朋友，凡是糊塗的，現在！都很闊氣了，反之者却倒盡天下之奇霉，這確是實情，我也有好幾位朋友和這定律一𠬆不爽。　　鄭板橋氏是淸朝的人物，那時候就是這種情形，現在才眞更應騐咧！就比方我們都認滿洲國的成立是不合情理的，是賣國的，是要上日本人的大當的。但鄭板橋氏的貴本家鄭孝胥老狗却偏要津津有味的去混，去上人家的當，所以「將就木焉」了的老狗，竟居然「晚景不差」，又大做其官來了。　　這類的以及其他的例子，眞是罄竹難書，爲省麻煩，還是一筆帶住，不再嚕囌了他。讀者諸君，做人眞要「糊塗」才好，尤是做二十世紀的人，尤其是做中國的人。　　哀歌  企吾　　人力車在石坂橋前停了下來，過橋向南，一家黑牆門的院子就是舅父家。我的黃金時代是在這屋子裏過去的。門前是個廣場，河道經過小橋匯入官河，從前是搭着兩條木板作爲橋梁的。我緩上橋頂，冬天的太陽是灰黃的，照在斑駁的黑牆上更顯得疏懶，但是門檐上的麻布却有力地刺進了我的眼簾，彷彿腦後被擊一悶棍似的怔住了，立卽又覺得這是意中事。母親發「舅父病重，速回」的電報要我回來的，早該知道這不是偶然的了。　　大門虛掩着，我小心地推了進去，沒有一個人，那情形近乎踏進荒山中的枯廟，一股濃厚的霉味刺進我的鼻官。如果你有餘閒仔細端詳一番，蜘蛛網，鼠糞，及製造霉味的腐敗物件四個⾓落裏都是黑黝黝的一大堆。那間老家人住着的臥房緊緊鎖着，想起那個老年人慈祥的臉，我急於穿過天井，到第二進大廳。　　大廳正中，一幅天官賜福被舅父的遺像代替了，天然几上一個大理石揷屏，及一個很高的花瓶都遺留着，不過左邊的蓋着一幅大布套，右邊的瓶口也不見了黃金的臘梅，殷紅的天竹子│歲暮點綴品；兩側一列是白色的綢幛，我的名字也在一個「傷心悽絕」軸幛的下欵地方發現了。　　像一個異鄉人走到陌生地方一樣，我久久不瞬注視着舅父的遺容│這個熟稔的臉呵，去年在我面前嘻笑着的怎變成了這樣可怕呢！　　是前年冬天了，舅父害了一塲大病，遵醫生的吩咐，到上海來養病，住在滬西近郊。每個星期日我去探望他，往往和年靑的朋友一樣東拉西扯的談上一大堆。有一次，他要我替他買個無綫電，他說：在鄉下被家務糾纏着，人是够煩死了，曾想到西湖去，那邊的飲食起居却又不慣│到上海來還是不得已的辦法，我以爲上海的囂鬧或者更甚於鄉下，現在郤覺得太淸靜了，沒有人來簡直像住在深山裏，倒想買個無綫電來解解寂寞呢。　　下次我捧了個無綫電去，他忽然要回家了，說是上海來住了半年多用途太大。這當然是事實，上海房價之貴，生活程度之高，還有每天出診非坐汽車不可的大醫生，不過一個什麼都怕聽怕動的老年人已覺到太寂寞而想買個無綫電來聽聽，他身體方面所得的利益已足够補償他的損失了。而且舅父是沒有兒子的，這是他終生的憾事，省吃儉用的積蓄起來，還是醫生鼓勵了才到上海來養病，我自然也以這番話挽留他，但是他終於沒有給我知道回去了，回到家裏煩死人的鄉下…我呆望着他的遺容，忘了這次歸來的意思，心中想着的是：　　「這就是舅父的一生嗎？」　　解脫  劍碧　　一個女人碰見一個　巴札洛甫的男人│具有不屈膝於任何崇敬與權威不受無證明理想人的誘惑，反對一切制度遺棄日常生活習俗與道德的桎梏│是大不幸事。　　現在她寄身於一寒村的中產之家的東廂房內，日常的生活是痛苦，貧乏與憔悴的交響曲。　　想起過往的一切，幾乎把她自己撕成粉碎，悔恨之心嚙着她的心靈，她的一切的舉動全反常的。理想幻滅之後的人生之悲劇，重演於憔悴了的音容上。　　愛撫，熱情，同情，憐恤，一切還</p>

<p>是她所希稽着的，她的心還依歸非常地鮮紅着。　　（夢幻似地，盲目的，多方敷衍的愛等於不愛，愛是佔有的，心是一顆啊！）　　爲着心靈的不寗靜，理實的滑稽化，縱使她得到一切是比任何人多，但愛的眼睛是生長有毒液的，它不能使第三者參與，於是在一個决然的肯定之下，躡脚逃出於人間。　　太陽，空氣，水是她追求的目的物。縱使她是交合着貧困，痛苦，憔悴的難以推度的現狀。　　目前，大自然是她唯一的伴侶，並不孤獨，但却覺得寂寞。　　自古以來的大哲學家沒有一個不由大寂寞而成爲一種哲理的，大寂寞的交逼，往往使人陷於「四大皆空」的悲觀方面去，因爲生命的衰褪便覺得痛苦了。生命力的衰褪類皆起於生活的不如意，在女人大半由於失戀或是對家庭的不滿，由此更進一步則社會人給予一切的刺激使女人更會陷入於所謂悲觀主義者哲理方面去。　　克已派和老荘的反撲派哲學以及中</p>
<p>國古代詩人是她寓居時的唯一良友。　　無論如何多讓哲學理論或是自求解脫的途徑，生理的影響於心理，終於她陷於叔本華的：　　「現實之人世已成無可救藥之萬惡淵藪，因意志（功名利祿）的衝動而更加惡化上上策莫善於撥開虛心，毀滅意志以求精神起昇的極樂國土。」　　於是在莫可奈何情况蕭條的初冬寒冷的夜晚，她聽着隔窗的野雨，朗吟着陸放翁的春夜讀書感懷詩。　　「我死骨卽朽，靑史亦無名，此詩倘不作，丹心將誰明」　　「欲談舊事無人共，日落鴉歸又倚樓。」　　卽使她努力於所謂事業，在現在畸形發展的全世界婦女的在社會爭奪立場上是婦女還是渺小不作爲的，因此，寒村的一⾓廂房中將逐漸憂悶以死的一個幻想破滅後的搜尋自我表現的意志堅强的由人間世的小我的情愛中甦醒以後追求所謂事業的女人。長江輪上  周漢　　在長江船上，因爲風平浪靜，一點沒有暈船的點痛苦，我的眼睛就時常張開，到處看着，我的耳朶也時常注意，到處聽聽，這麼一來見聞眞是廣博得多了。船到了蕪湖，剛靠碼頭，上來了一個中年女人進我們的房間住下，本來只是我一個人合一個從南京一起上來的回家女學生，這麼就有三個人，將房間裏頭三個鋪位都住滿了。從南京一起上來的女學生，十幾歲的小姑娘又天眞又聰明，我合她兩人說得來玩得來，如今進來了這麼一個中年女人，看她風塵滿面是一個跑慣江湖的人，老槍的容顏，一看就令人不舒服，小姑娘用眼睛向我示意，做了一回鬼臉，她是不高興這中年女人的了，我也不樂意，而且窗前的上下鋪位已經被我們兩人佔住了，旁邊的一個鋪位本來是給我們放箱子合籃子的，她一進來，茶房將我們的箱子籃子放到地下與鋪底去了，這多麼氣人的事那女人隨身帶上一個箱子合一個鋪蓋，一進房間就呌茶房將鋪蓋打開披好，上去躺着，隨手從那小草袋裏抽出一包哈德門香烟，點了火就抽起香烟來。你是知道的，我一聞到香烟頭就要暈，這怎麼得了？那小姑娘是女學生也怕香烟的，我們兩人大不高興。小姑娘年紀輕不敢干涉，只是開窗通空氣和用手帕兒掩住口鼻，我却受不住，嗆了一下就向那女人說道，「對不起，我們怕香烟嗆人，請你到外邊去抽吧。」那女人却世故得很，蠻懂事的，馬上答應道，「呵呵，我不知道，得罪得罪。」馬上站起身開了房門到外邊去了。我生平是不怕人不講理的，這回那女人一講理起來，我倒不好意思起來，覺得她也是搭船的客人，我也不過是搭船的女人，如今把她趕到外邊去，不是她的自由都被我們兩人奪去了嗎，而且，豈不是我們兩人變成了主人，她變成了沒相干的人了嗎，我在莫名其妙的沉思胡想，小姑娘高興地對我說，「也還聽話哦？」我點頭表示同意，可是說不出什麼話來。我能够說什麼話呢，是不是？　　船開以後，那女人找機會合我們談話，問我們到那裏啦，問我們從那裏來的啦，問我們在那個學堂唸書啦，態度是那麼誠懇，溫和，謙遜，有禮貌，聲聲句句都呌我們小姐，還以爲我們兩人是姊姊，呌我大小姐，呌小姑娘二小姐啦。我們能够拒絕合她談話嗎？當然不能够的，於是乎談呀談的，談得熟起來了。　　船要到安慶的時候，她在船邊眺望碼頭，好像在等人一樣；船一靠碼頭，跟着她進房間來的是一個大漢，她開了箱取出一包東西遞給那人，這就使我懷疑啦。一包什麼東西呢？一定是私貨。一個走私漏稅的傢伙！船開以後，我追問她那是一包什麼東西，她笑着說，「你們學生，是好人，不瞞你說，我是做生意的人。那一包東西就是生意。」原來眞的是私貨。她嘆息着生活艱難，沒辦法才做這犯法的事。我又同情她了。她說她的丈夫從前幹這生意的，吃了官司禁在牢裏，她在家裏有兒子有母親，一家人要吃飯，沒辦法只得替她丈夫出來冐險。她羨慕我們做小姐的，前世有修，今世享福。……我同情她的境况，我又替她担心啦。像這樣的女人，又是値得佩服，多麼能幹？這回江上之行，見聞廣啦。　　自我職業介紹　　燕君，年十八歲，北方人，畢業某商科中學，肄業上海美專，曾任某電氣公司職員，精於打樣繪畫廣告簿記珠算等，現願就練習生小學敎員及其他職業，待遇不拘，備有鋪保，欲雇用此項人才者，請函民國路二百六十三號五樓五零二號張君轉。　　馮雯女士，粵籍，師範畢業，能操國語，歷任小學敎員家庭敎師等職，現賦閒在家，如有需上項人材及小孩保姆者請至北四川路餘慶坊一二三號陳先生轉。　　某君，年十七，浙江鎭海人，中學程度，茲願任公司機關行號社局事務所練習生或傳遞生等職，備有殷實舖保，如有意雇用者請函虹口蓬路五九七弄三十一號。　　業餘信箱（一）弟兄分產的問題編者先生：　　茲有兄弟三人，在父未死前，因父年老，母亦早故，一切家務均由長兄所管，兩弟則在外讀書，由家供給學費。現父已死，弟兄輩均擬分析遺產，各立門戶。惟在分家時，兩弟謂兄在管理家務時，曾暗存钜欵，（有證據）而兄則否認此事。同時長兄已娶，兩弟均未娶妻，故弟輩又要求另外提出若干，以作兩人結婚之用，餘數再平均分配，兄不允，以致引起糾紛，兩弟决聯合請法律解决。該兄弟三人均係吾友，吾甚希彼等和平了結，故特函上，擬請先生代設一法，以免涉訟法庭爲盼。　　　　王彥臣上　　編者按：王君所詢遺產問題，內容複雜，編者不能根據所述簡略情形，而輕予答覆。且此種有關法律上之糾紛，大非空言所能解决。故此事如能雙方諒解，和平了結，最佳。如兩弟堅决力爭此產，可將詳細情形，及長兄侵欵證據，改向律師詢問，相機進行。　　惟編者對遺產有一意見：認爲不勞而獲之遺產，祇能養成一般人享樂揮霍之習慣。且可消滅靑年進取之精神，如用之不當，則實有害無益。故甚望兄弟等不必顧念遺產之爭取，亟應注意本人之前途，努力實行自立爲人之目標。否則雖有豐富之遺產，亦絕不能持久也。　　（二）如何學國語編者先生：　　我國各地方言不同，言語殊感隔閡，時常引起誤會。故我甚希全國人民能完全實行國語，則便利多多矣。　　惟我本人對國語則一句也說不出，與別人講話時，甚爲痛苦，而別人之流利國語。尤令我羨慕不已也。故我積極欲學國語，苦又有欲學無從之感。想先生爲人們導師。當能解决我之困難，因特函上，擬懇指示學習國語之門徑，並請介紹一二本有自習材料之國語指導書籍。如蒙俯允，不勝感謝之至。此上，並請撰安　　　　　　　　　白鈺上　　編者按：欲學國語，可常與會講國語之人談話，自己再努力學習，則日久當能達此目的。並無特別門徑。　　關於有自學材料之國語指導書，現在極少，至於敎授國語注音符號之書雖有，惟在此注音符號不甚發達之際，除少數小學課本外，其他書籍，多未採用此種符號，故在目前雖已學會，似亦無大用也。君如欲學此，可向中華書局購「國語注意符號使用法」或「注意符號全書」看看，最好有人指導，否則甚難見功也。李宗杰先生作品無綫電播音節目歌唱　　上海無綫電劇社　　永生（一○八○）下午四時半至五時半　　因爲你太美　　（姚莉）　　鐘聲　　　　　（露茜）　　夜來香　　　　（曼娜）　　伏爾加船夫曲　（姚莉）　　慢牛快馬　　　（露茜）　　梅花接老爺　　（姚莉）　　擱樓上的小姐　（曼娜）　　大中華（一一六○）下午八時至九時）　　追回本來　　　（嚴斐）　　園裏園外　　　（姚莉）　　可愛的中華　　（露茜）　　紫羅蘭　　　　（曼娜）　　求愛秘訣　　　（姚莉）　　銀色的凄涼　　（露茜）　　等一等吧　　　（曼娜）　　逍遙調　　　　（嚴斐）　　菊社　　華美（一○六○）下午四時三刻至五時半　　夜月之歌　　　（兪日明）　　蘇三不要哭　　（石琪霞）　　夜來香　　　　（王飛華）　　努力　　　　　（許玲玲）　　賣油條　　　　（兪月明）　　芭蕉葉上詩　　（石琪霞）　　飛音社　　華興（一二六○）下午六時至七時　　前奏曲　　　　（全體樂隊）　　愛情如玫瑰　　（人露）　　鴛鴦怨　　　　（曼娜）　　歸程　　　　　（露茜）　　偉大的愛　　　（佈德）　　「以下播送要求歌曲節目當日另時排定」　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二○○）下午九時至十時）　　船夫曲　　　　（珮婷流朗）　　農村之歌　　　（曼娜）　　蝴蝶姑娘　　　（露茜）　　銀色的凄凉　　（黛蕾）　　歸程　　　　　（王真）　　湘纍　　　　　（曼娜）　　窮快樂　　　　（露茜）　　悲秋　　　　　（珮婷）　　彈詞　　姚小庵王萍秋麟麒豹　　中西（一○四○）下午十一時至十二時　　開篇「新年」　　淡蕩春風處處和。萬家邊炮萬家鑼。新年初四連初五。五路財神迎接多。福禮三星無不有。鷄魚猪肉满盤舖。松毛柏子冬靑葉。辭歲迎神不可無。萬戶千門具敬重。路頭菩薩無功夫。窮人家未必親身到。利市招財替代多。有燭有香常到到。無茶無酒冷疎疎。眞乙玄檀終怕到。金輪如意不貪圖。我家要接財神日。五月端陽勿在乎。聞說鍾馗嫁妹子。路頭菩薩討家婆。因此得知鍾馗士。至親郎舅兩稱呼。妻親舅。胞妹夫。自然有事說帮扶。定與內兄稱壽誕。安排公分奏笙歌。財帛使司亦有分。大家决不看輕我。大發財源快如梭。　　　　話劇　　觀音社　　中西（一○四○）下午七時一刻至八時　　「空谷蘭」　　紉珠化名了幽蘭夫人，跑到杭州去担任柔云小學的敎務長，她的目的是爲了良彥。　　中華（一一四○）下午八時一刻至九時　　「好兒子」　　一個家庭的生活，全指望一個人去負担，這的確是件不容易的事；再加上幾個月的，失業，那更是難維持了。債戶壘壘的逼迫，這是陸愼卿所受到的苦痛，可是他的母親並不窮，暗中早蓄下了不少錢財，但│他不拿出來用，硬把一個好兒子逼走到犯法的路上去。國學　　汪冰梅女士唐詩　　華興（一二六○）上午九時至十時　　子夜歌（其三）　　李白　　長安一片月，萬戶擣衣聲。秋風吹不盡，　　　　總是玉關情。何日平胡虜，良人罷遠征？　　子夜歌（其四）　　李白　　明朝驛使發，一夜絮征袍。素手抽鍼冷。　　　　那堪把翦刀！我縫寄遠道，幾日到臨洮？　　烈女操　　　　　　孟郊　　梧桐相待老，鴛鴦會雙死。貞婦貴殉夫，　　　　捨生亦如此。波瀾誓不起，妾心古井水。新聞與消息　　本埠元昌電台（周率一一二○）自本月廿九日起，每日下午二時半至三時一刻，增加馬興濤君敎授唱歌節目，幷有汪淡淡，汪小淡小姐等加入歌唱云。　　芙蓉團自今日起至二月三日止，各界可隨時用電話或信函要求，時間及電台如後：　　下午五時半至六時一刻　　市音　　下午七時至八時　　　　　安定　　　　下午八時至九時　　　　　斬新　　下午九時至十時　　　　　大中華　　下午十時　刻至十一時　　中西</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　建築周刊中世紀之建築（上）  欽　　歐洲建築的發達史，我們已經知道其起原和發展，遠在二千多年前，就十分興盛。美術的建築從埃及傳至美索帕達米亞，再傳至希臘，然後羅馬人又把他們的建築發揚而光大之，於是歐洲乃有世界上著名之偉大建築。　　但在希臘式的建築在法國興起之前，其間却又有一段不可毀滅的歷史。這時候的歐洲人都個個被建築的熱狂所引動，他們想同羅馬的大敎堂相嫓美。可是大體的講來，他們的建築式樣多半是僞羅馬式的，而其中却缺少了羅馬人的果毅勇敢的精神。　　歐洲其他民族的人民在這時還沒有知道羅馬人製水泥的方法，因此他們不能用混凝土來建造房屋。他們很羨慕羅馬的圓頂建築方法，所以他們也用小石塊和磚瓦仿造起來，這在意大利之北部與法蘭西之南部是最盛行了，他們不知道這高聳雲端的大圓頂是要需用一個極堅固的臺墩的，像羅馬人的巨厚的牆壁或像希臘式的一類擎柱，來支撐全部的重量。所以結果他們所造的建築就都毀壞了，不能留傳下來。雖然，我們從這些建築的大略的形狀，範圍，和彫刻上，總覺這時代的設計的人毅力不差，他們的野心可以說是比他們的技術强的多了。　　後來，漸漸地我們又發見鋼骨的弧拱，這鋼骨的建造法是羅馬人用來增加混凝土的力量的，但是歐洲其他的人民不懂得鋼骨混凝土的造法，他們祇用鋼骨來支持弧拱交接地方的重量和房屋上突出部份的重量而已。這一種建築方法，在不知不覺中竟引了他們向哥西克式的一條路上走去。　　但是這種建築方式的變化是絕對不能單用一點或一方面的理由來說明的，因爲建築方式的變化，同時一定需要設計者的堅持的精神，靈敏的才幹，和遠大的目光，才能成功。哥西克的建築富有力的美觀，而這種力是流動性的，表示著平衡的配合，和羅馬建築中的靜力和諧的美觀，自有不同。同時其設計頗注重於建築的高度，我們可以想見當時的許多建築大半都有一個聳立雲端的高塔，傲視著地上的一切。　　建築的方法與材料是哥西克式的設計中極重要的兩點。我們知道羅馬人很喜歡用　種僞飾的方法來隱藏內部粗陋的部分　　是在哥西克式中，建築家不再用僞飾的方法來求建築的美觀了。他們喜歡在材料的組織上和各部不可分離的合一的性質上講究。有時他們更喜用不平衡的或是不對稱的建築形式，這也時常可以顯出一種別有風味的美觀。　　新式住宅建築和衛生設計  希浩　　衛生設計在新式住宅建築上的重要，十數年前的建築師，可以說是完全沒有注意到。最近幾年中，這個問題雖然漸漸的被一般工程師所重視，但在實際的建築設計上，仍舊未能儘量的「衛生化」，這是目前工程師不能辭咎的一個重要責任。　　我們知道，住宅建築是一般人日常的棲息所。牠的衛生設計，關係各個棲息分子的健康問題。同時，牠也可以影響到其他相鄰的單位的健康問題，所以，歐美的建築師，把這「衛生設計」當作住宅建築的先决問題，這也是二十世紀建築的特點，很値得我們注意與研究。　　衛生設計在新式住宅建築上的第一個問題。當然是「空氣」的問題。空氣是人生不可片刻缺少的東西，這是大家所知道的，但是在住宅建築上，怎樣的去更換適當量的新鮮空氣，實在是建築學上很大的問題，在充滿烟霧的都市　要得到適當量的清潔空氣換氣，是一般工程師所感到束手的問題。自動的換氣風扇，雖然可以更換室內的新鮮空氣，但是不能夠排除空氣內飽和着的一切烟塵和氣體，現在歐美各國較大的住宅建築，都裝置着小型的空氣壓縮機，外界的空氣，先經過壓縮機洗去種種的烟霧和其他不潔物然後用管子通入住宅的各部，用過後的空氣，設法排除。這種制度雖好，但是不適宜於小規模的住宅，爲了經濟問題的要求，除掉裝置自動通風扇而外，在這風扇的後面，　更裝一種空氣清潔器，這種清潔器係極細的回形銅𠬆網，牠能夠阻止空氣內極細的烟霧或不潔小粒的通過。但是一切臭味的氣體，（例如汽車排除氣體中的二氣化碳三氧化硫等）就無法使牠們隔離，現在雖有工程師發明把某種化合物塗附空氣清潔器上，用來除掉這種氣體，但尙在試騐時期，我們尙難測其結果，目前惟一的補救法，就是在住宅四周種着常綠的樹木，因爲牠們有極强的自然清潔作用，不過地位的問題，實在是每一個工程師應當設計的。　　衛生設計的第二個問題，是「光綫」的問題，我們粗看起來，這個問題對於一般人的生活，沒有多大關係。其實不然，「光綫」問題，可以轉移整個身心的愉快，牠足以影響整個身體的神經和健康，我們設計時不得不精細的從事。光綫可大別爲二類，卽自然的日光，和人造的燈光，面南的住宅，光綫最佳，所以設計時應當儘量的面南開啟窗戶，以引進多量的日光，非但安慰一般人的身心，並且可以藉此殺却空氣內的黴菌，其他方向的窗戶，設計時應注意適當的面積，牆壁粉飾顏色的配置得法，每會使你的光綫改良，這也是應當注意的一件事情。（未完）建築行話（五）  梅震寰　　│關於築場裏用│　　草油│（Prime　Coat)漆匠在堂子上或其他器具上塗的第一次油漆打底時，呌草油。　　燥頭│（Pｒｉｅｒ）假使油漆要求它的性質上的快燥，那衹有拌和些燥頭了燥頭是一種質地非常乾燥的東西。　中管檔│什麼呌中管檔（Tｒａｍ　ｓｏｎ）就是堂子在腰頭（Fａｎ　Lｉｇｈｔ）和大門（Dｏｏｒ）距離隔離的一根橫檔。　　挺│是組織門窗上的一種料作，的稱呼，它分中挺（Lｏｃｋ　Sｔｙｌｅ）邊挺（Sｉｄｅ　ｓｔｙｌｅ）等名目。　　冐頭│冐頭也是組織門窗上的一種料作的稱呼，它有上冐頭（Tｏｐ　Rａｉｌ）中冐頭（Lｏｃｋ　Rａｉｌ）下冐頭（Bｏｔｔｏｍ　Rａｉｌ）之分，除此之外，在門窗上的料作的稱呼，尙有芯子，凹綫條，檳子等許多種類。　　碰門│（Dｏｏｒ　Sｔｏｐ）（恐怕門的執手（Hａｎｄｌｅ）不論磁器，玻璃或銅質的，有時候給猛力一推，或者要撞損墻壁上的粉刷，所以在地板上（Fｌｏｏｒ）或踢踏綫（Sｋｉｒｔｉｎｇ）上釘了一個碰頭，用以阻止重力，它是木料做成，形狀方圓不定　　牽槓│脚手（Sｃａｔｆｏｌｄｉｎｇ）架在高度的建築物的基地上，在搭的時候，因爲竹或木料的長度不夠，必需逐層搭起，橫的一根就呌牽槓，還有堅直的呌衝天，擺脚手板的呌橫楞，防備動搖的二根相义的呌拋撑，這些都是屬於脚手架　　刮草│泥水匠在墻身上刮的第一塗粉刷底坯。這呌刮草，普通用柴泥居多，還有用黃沙膠泥，但這是普通像街房之類不常用的。　　收進│（Sｅｔ　Bａｃｋ）房屋的高度或馬路綫的闊度，假定有超出公務局的規定營造法度以外者：勢必收進，（例如馬路收進幾尺咧，房屋收進幾尺咧，）還有墻身下的大方脚，（Fｏｏｔｉｎｇ）起初比較墻身闊大，以後逐皮改縮，這也呌收進，（佛如收進二十寸咧，收進十五寸咧。）　　浮樹│（Mｏｖｉｎｇ）築場裏最困難的是搬運料作，第一層房屋砌起時，對於放置擱　（Jｏｉｓｔ）必需依賴浮橋。（待續）　　西湖建築風景區徵求標準圖案　　甲　建築地點　　西湖四山及平地，以能望見西湖者爲限。　　乙　圖樣範圍　　㈠住宅類　不論出租與自住，均須採隔離式。　　㈡公共建築類　指會堂旅館戲院等項，四週均須有圍庭。　　丙　設計標凖　　㈠式樣　不論東西式，只要適合地位環境，而不背於風景藝術化。　　㈡顏色　取鮮艷而不失於俗，素淡而不失於黯，總須適合環境。　　㈢高度　山上建築，不得高逾二層，平地不得過三層，每層高度除宮殿式者外，以四公尺至五公尺爲限度，但均以不遮碍名勝者爲限。　　㈣造價　造價較現有市價不可過高，以符現時社會經濟狀況。　　丁　圖案要點　　㈠　每種圖樣，須有平面圖，樓面圖，屋面圖，正面圖，及剖面圖，如能用鳥瞰圖表現景色者尤善，其尺寸均用公尺。　　㈡　應徵人應將建築材料及外觀色彩註明，或另具說明書亦可。　　㈢　房屋外面裝飾設備，及地位應詳細繪明。　　㈣　應徵圖樣，須與杭市建築規則相符。　　㈤　應徵圖樣紙張大小，長六十公分，寬九十公分，比例尺爲五十分之一，須用墨筆繪明，除尺寸外，均用中文書寫。　　戊　徵求辦法　　㈠　由杭市府函國內各建築師，並登報徵求，應徵者須於二十四年三月一日前將圖樣及說明書送至市府工務科，經市府聘定各專家定期召集公同審查，應徵人祇寫符號於圖樣上，其姓名地址及所用符號，應另密封函送本府，俟圖案審定後拆對之。　　㈡　凡應徵圖樣中選者，槪不發還，杭市府並得將中選之圖樣及說明註明中選人姓名，印刋專冊，供市民營造參考之用。　　㈢　每類中選者均由本府嘉奬首選三名，並各依次得獎金二百元，一百元，及五十元。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊蓓蒂黛維所述好萊塢給他的敎訓  叔敏　　「蘗僓」（Oｆ　Hｕｍａｎ　Bｏｎｄａｇｅ）中的女主⾓蓓蒂黛維𠬆（Bｅｔｔｅ　Dａｖｉｓ），在表演了「蘗債」之後，却被人認作她是一位仇視女性的女子。因爲她表表演得太深郂了，使人看了「蘗債」，都憤恨其中的那個無恥的女堂倌，而輕視了普遍的女性。其實，她不過是儘量地做戲，做得淋漓盡致，歷歷如繪而已。她自己是個女子，她亦有女朋友，她何嘗是仇視女性呢？　　蓓蒂不僅是一位觀察深刻的人。她亦是好萊塢許多女子中，腦筋最淸醒的一個人。她的藝術，並不是淺薄的摩倣，而且身歷其境的體騐。她的家庭生活，亦是極合乎理智，在好萊塢是別具一格的。她的丈夫，哈孟納爾孫，是一個飯店裏的鋼琴師。她自己是一位明星，收入大約每星期一千美金。但是她的家庭生活費，却是依照她丈夫的薪水，量入爲出的。她自已每天到攝影場，有一輛大的新汽車。那是依照她明星的身份不得不如此的。但是平常和她丈夫同去遊玩的時候，她却同她丈夫坐着一輛破汽車。　　這是她特別的地方，而且好萊塢普通的人，所不肯做的。但是她的理由，却是很充足的，亦不完全在節省上面，雖然那亦是很重要的。一個女演員的日子，是很短的。她不得不力求撙節，以備將來。但是蓓蒂最大的理由，却不僅在節省費用上面。她說，凡是自愛的男子，都有自重獨立之心，而不喜歡依賴女子的收入以爲生的。她自己是個女明星，她丈夫是個職位低微的綱琴師，但她却不願使他覺得自已職業的低微。她總要使她丈夫知道，不是他依賴她，而是她依賴他。男子是一家之主，應當担負家高庭經濟之責。所以他們家庭間的共同生活費，係由她丈夫担負的，不過他們各人亦有各人的私賬而已。　　恐怕間話說得太累贅了。我這裏要說的，就是蓓蒂的觀察深刻，體騐豐富。由於深刻的觀察，豐富的體騐，然後才有透澈的理解，和合乎理智的行動。以下就是她所述的，得之於好萊塢的一些敎訓，可作爲一般電影從業者的人生借鏡的：　　好萊塢的生活，是和別地方一樣，個人方面的調洽，是必需的。要是你是生存在一個完全理想的，烏託邦的世界之中的，那你就可以享受絕對的自由，要怎樣做就怎樣做，要怎樣說話。就怎樣說話但是我們的世界，並不是什麼理想的世界。因此，我們必須和現實和環境相調洽，無論你在什麼地方。不過在這好萊塢却有一個不同之點│就是一個人很容易地調洽得過份了，失去了你自已，而成了好萊塢的一部分。簡言之，就是失去你自己的個性而已　　這或者是因爲你進影界之光，你自己訓練自己過於嚴酷的緣故。大凡到了好萊塢，你第一個會學到的敎訓，就是克制你的意氣。你一定要對於受懲罰，受苛刻的批評，受種種的侮辱，要能夠忍受，牢牢記着那些都是有益於你的事業和藝術的。在這安心忍受之中，你往往就過份的遷就，依遵任何人的意旨，失却了自己的判斷力，喪夫了自己的個性。　　「再則在好萊塢最易犯的一種毛病，就是誠意的喪失，因爲你在好萊塢住久了，就是會學得個人的意見，是不可以任意表示的。這樣，往往就流於虛僞不實之中。　　「在好萊塢，你是不能希望外界來稱讚你的工作的。因此，爲補償那種缺乏，你就不能不有自身的欣賞。但是，除非你自己能了解你自己，你往往妄自尊大起來，或是用矯柔造作的形式，想在他人身上生出特別的影像。　　「你一定要從早覺悟到節儉的必要，而不將你收入的全部化去。在好萊塢最大的危險，就是賺大薪水的時候，你少用一點錢，就覺得窘極不堪，不合自己的身份。其實，那都是受了一種無意識的虛榮心的驅使所致。你須明白你的大薪水久暫。是根據於大衆的好上的，而大衆的好惡却是極不可靠而有時是無可理解的。　　「從踏進影界的第一天開始，你一定要和報界接近，誠實無欺地接待報界的代表，供給他們真實的消息。這並不是說你一定要利用報界的人，來替你捧場宣傳。他們的忠告和批評，無論是印在紙上的，或是當面送達的都是値得你虛心接受的。影片談評評「學宮花絮」  繼漢　　Bａｃｈｅｌｏｒ　Aｒｔｓ│國泰　　稍微帶一點諷刺的姿態，以大學生的思想，生活，動態爲題材，向靑年學子作庸俗的說敎，這便是說明「學宮花絮」之本質。更詳細一點的解說，那末，劇作者的見解是很平凡的。他說一個富家子的學生，要用功讀書，不要浪費，要刻苦耐勞，要盡力量的幫助窮敎授夫婦，但是切不可相信社會主義，同時不妨和一個工讀的女子戀愛。另一方面寫一個女學生，她以自己的收入來求學，她愛上了一個富家子，而且使那富家子真誠的愛她。就爲了强調他主題的說敎，所以將社會主義的信徒，以譏諷的手法描寫他們都是書獃子或者是　動者，而富家子戴着高帽去參加社會主義信徒之聚會時，立刻給他一次懲罰。至於專事冶遊的學生們，自然也是在諷刺之下而出現的。　　可喜的是將美國的大學生之羣、很生動的素描出來，但是它敎動亂時代的學生們平凡的生活下去，這裏的素描的成功便是一種惡效果的可愛了。換句話說，正因爲其使人們覺得可愛，便使其給予觀衆們以不良的影響。　　是的，人們會在這一影片之中覺着少許輕妙之感，但是沉悶的成份是超過了輕妙成份的，更將技術方面分開來說，那末從導演以至演員都表現着庸俗。我們並不因爲男女主⾓的無聲望而輕視他們，事實上他們的演技都是很生疏的。比較的說，還是男主⾓較女主⾓純熟一些。　　紅羊傳中之髮辮問題  逸　　耗資十餘萬，費時十個月所攝製之紅羊豪俠傳有聲巨片，茲已全部告竣，公映有期。此片攝製與舞豪劇絕不相同，一切服裝背景，力求逼眞當時情狀。經營擘　，煞費苦心。然有一點，却不得不稍背於事實，原來前淸時代，人各蓄髮辮，垂垂腦後，厥形異常醜惡，西洋人因加以豚尾二字之詆諷。今紅羊傳中之銀幕人物，均無髮辮之特殊點綴，實以此條髮辮，有失國體。比較之餘，覺得國體見辱，關係非淺，稍背事實，尙屬小節。並且銀幕人物之行動，大都正面多，反面少，取消髮辮，並不令人發生異感。聞新華公司諸職員，因髮辮問題，曾多次討論乃始毅然取消云。　　「空谷蘭」贈送歌曲　　明星公司出品之默片「空谷蘭」，爲國片中膾炙人口，婦孺皆知之名作。明星公司爲應觀衆之需要，特將該片討論改編，重攝爲歌唱對白有聲片。擷精取華，成十二大本（原作分前後二部，）仍由張石川導演。主演人選，則由國內最著名紅星胡蝶，高占非，宣景琳，嚴月閒担任。現該片業已全部攝竣。試片以後，成績極爲美滿，該片中有歌曲「空谷蘭」，（王乾白作詞，嚴工上作曲，）「鳳求皇」，「大地行軍曲」，「抗敵歌」，（以上皆安娥作詞，任興作曲）等四種，極悠揚動聽。讀者如需要該項歌曲，可附郵票二分，寄本埠西蒲石路，明星影片公司，宣傳科索取，即當隨函送奉一份云。　　「新女性」預備啼聲　　人人渴望着的「新女性」已鐵定於春節日誕生，因此孕育新女性的蔡楚生導演的工作　完又忙著於配音的工作了。「新女性」是全部配聲配樂和歌唱的出品，其工作的審愼比較「大路」還要加倍。連日音響主任聶耳更其日夜地大忙，很有把握地要做到「新女性」啼聲初試能夠一嗚驚人。還有一個好消息就是睥睨影壇的阮玲玉女士在她主演的這傑作內第一次開口唱「新女性歌」了。　　聯華當局因對此片極爲重視，故擬於舊年除夕舉行獻映禮，幷由全上海各國貨公司工廠徵求許多貨品分贈觀衆。各界士女參加極端歡迎，惟須注意舉行時間：爲除夕夜之十二時零一分云。攝製中的「天倫」　　鐘石根「人生」之後的偉著「天倫」，由羅明佑費穆合導，早經攝製。此劇的宏偉，堪稱中國銀壇幾年來所未有。內容的充實動人，自無疑義，因爲在鐘氏的劇本中，你是找不到空泛無聊的東西，至於演員方面，這次差不多可稱爲全體明星大合作。林楚楚，陳燕燕，黎灼灼，張翼，鄭君里，黎鏗，尙冠武，梅琳……都在這裏大顯身手。這劇寫三個時代的故事中有三對夫妻，尙冠夫與林楚楚，張翼與黎灼灼，鄭君里與梅琳·陳燕燕扮做楚楚冠武的女兒，黎鏗是幼年時期的鄭君里。現在，所拍的戲都是林楚楚與陳燕燕的重頭戲，因爲所拍的戲都是情感非常之重，所以她們都能眞的動情，尤其悲劇的部分收獲是萬分美滿。電通消息一束　　㈠在「新女性」中有着很好演技的顧夢鶴，現已加入電通，在「風雲兒女」中他是一個前進的革命靑年。　　㈡袁牧之在今日，誰都知道他是不穿漂亮西裝的。日前，他忽然戴了一頂金𠬆草帽，「穿了花呢，上裝，條子嗶嘰褲子，花蛇皮鞋，手裏拿了一根手杖，大模大樣的在攝影上踱着。有人驚訝地問他：「老袁，這套漂亮衣服怎樣弄到手的」？他很俏皮的說：「是C夫人送給我的啊」！　　㈢外傳趙丹王瑩璐璐進電通了說不確。　　㈣在電通的化裝室裏，牧之是個打着大領結的詩人，人美是打着二根小辮兒的姑娘，坐在一邊旁的革命者顧夢鶴笑着對牧之說：「你這樣子敢上舞場嗎」？牧之說：「怎麼不敢，有人肯出五元錢，我便同他跳一次」這時，人美忽跳出來說：「五元錢跳一次，我也高興去的」。說着，大家哄的笑開啦！　　㈤最有希望的新星陸麗麗，在「風雲兒女」裏，她的成績是超過了一般老明星以上的。電影小說紅羊豪俠傳（八）  兆初　　桂平縣將李殿元，貪而且狠，和桂平知縣不睦。他在簽押房內徘徊走了幾轉，回臉對他的文案說：「這次他放走了洪秀全，聽說是韋昌輝來用的錢，縣裏不該不來給我一點消息」，那尖嘴黃狼似的文案先生笑着說道：「我倒有點小主意，可以一報此恨，亦可以少補這次的損失」，李殿元忙問他：「是怎樣的一個妙計啊」？那文案說：祇要把韋昌輝抓來，造成通盜證據，送到縣裏去辦。韋家有的是錢，倒要看知縣怎樣調理這件事了」。李殿元聽得出神，連連點頭贊成說道：「好計你眞是我的諸葛亮，一准照你的辦」。　　韋昌輝和他的父親，正在計算他家財產，打着算盤，忽的老家人進業報說：「縣裏李副將在大廳等候」，昌輝聽了，很是奇怪的說：「他爲什麼來見」？說着，亦就立起走了出去，李殿元帶了四個兵卒，在徘徊着，韋昌輝走了進來，李倨傲的看着他，韋很恭順的請他坐，他亦不坐，李豪不客氣的發話道：韋昌輝！你怎麼勾結强盜，樹立黨羽，謀反朝廷」？韋聽了震駭萬分，說道：「我一向安分守已，那來這種說話」？韋正在辯說，他的父親也自內走出，李殿元說：「現在我不和你分辯，來！把他抓了去」！說時，那四個兵士，就取出鐵鍊，套住了昌輝，拖着就往外去，韋父謁立要說話，亦不容分說，就拖去了，李殿元與知縣並坐在公案之上，韋昌輝立在下面，縣官把驚堂板一拍，喝聲跪下，於是旁立的差人，在他腿下一棍，把他打跌，跪在地下，那兩位官員厲聲問說：「現在有人告發，證據確實，你還敢抵賴」，韋昌輝不甘屈辱，說道：「我自己實在不能明白所犯何罪」，那李殿元喝聲說：你放刁抵賴，用刑」！走上二個差人拖下，隨即把衣服剝下，另一個人取過皮鞭來，那鞭打的人喝唱數目，鞭子一下一下打去，昌輝咬着牙忍受着，不說一句話，韋昌輝的父親，立在廊下看着，心痛淚流。兩個官員看了這種情形，說道：「他不招認，且把他囚在大牢裏」，韋父要想衝上去說話，但被旁立的差人攔住了，差人來把昌輝推進牢裏，鐵鍊鎖在柱上，昌輝依靠在壁邊，悲憤無言。　　曾家大廳中，空氣緊張，彼此面面相覷，聽着那韋家老　說道：「現在少爺關在牢裏，已經挨了幾頓毒刑了。說着，隱隱的哭着，這時蕭朝貴陡的拔出劍來，斫去掉子的一⾓，喊着說道：「不相信我們現在還能忍耐嗎」。洪秀全當即對衆人說：「桂平縣所以要和韋大哥作難，就因爲韋大哥有錢，現在我們就用錢去救韋大哥，等到金錢失了效用的時候，我們可祇得爆發了」。曾玉珩對於洪秀全的話，表示贊成，說道：我的意思，就這麼辦，桂平縣裏我有熟人，這事等我去走一躺吧」。洪秀全接着說：「最好有達開兄同去，我們更可以放心，秀淸朝貴二位帶二百多人，隨後到韋家左近、探聽有什麼危急，可以出來接應」。楊秀淸蕭朝貴聽着，答應了，洪秀全接着又向大衆說：「這次說不定就要發動起義，我們在村裏的弟兄們，一齊準備出發」，衆人齊聲答應着，都顯出歡悅的聲音，其時兩匹馬已預備好，曾王珩石達開走來，即上馬加鞭而云，衆人排例隊伍，楊蕭在選擇出發的人衆，人都願意爭先出發，擾攘的喧鬧着。（未完）</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Igi, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, received a telegram from the Kwantung Army Headquarters on the 27th and has gone to Changchun.

<p>(Tianjin) A suspect surnamed Zhang was arrested in Qinhuangdao by the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau for the bombing case of the Yuguan Huikong Transfer Bureau on the 16th. He has been escorted to Yuguan for interrogation and confessed to plotting the bombing. There are two accomplices, one hiding in Qinhuangdao and one hiding in Beiping.

<p>(Tianjin) Cao Jianting, the Jiyu postal director, said that after the resumption of postal services, about 20,000 pieces of mail are sent to outside the pass every day, and about 300 pieces of European mail are transferred. Chinese people automatically do not write false organizations or false place names. Westerners only write the word "Manchuria." Only certain countries deliberately disrupt the situation. The two transfer bureaus are handling matters quickly, but it seems that the postal service outside the pass is not being handled well, so delivery is very slow. Inside the pass, mail is sent as soon as it arrives, without any backlog. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Jiyu Postal Administration is ready and has decided to implement domestic and foreign parcel remittances on February 1st. The personnel of the Yugu two Huikong transfer bureaus have been deployed completely. However, it is expected that there will be few transactions on the first day of operation, which happens to be the Lunar New Year's Day. This time, the parcel postage will be slightly higher than before. The postage for each small parcel outside the pass is set at 40 cents, up to Yugu. The postage for large parcels is doubled according to the excess amount. The transfer bureau settles accounts every three months. The quota for first-class bureau tickets is set at 1,000 yuan, and the quota for second-class bureaus and below is set at 500 yuan per ticket. Settlements are made once a month.

The Outer Mongolian authorities must be responsible for this conflict. 2. Request Outer Mongolia to confirm Harbin as puppet territory. 3. Request Outer Mongolia to guarantee that it will no longer cross the border in the future. (Japanese United Press telegram on the 28th)</p>

According to statistics, the incidents of conflict between Japan and Outer Mongolia are: 1. More than ten Mongolian soldiers clashed with the puppet Manchukuo Darhazi Self-Defense Regiment on the banks of the Ursun River in the area east of Buir Lake.

<p>Gan Naikang: Tool for Political Innovation</p>
<p>Ding Weifen: Unite to Save the Nation from Disaster</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held the 167th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 28th.

Chairman Chen Guofu presided over the meeting. Gan Naikang reported on "The Tool for Political Innovation," stating that there are two ways to innovate politics: if it is a fundamental overthrow, it is called a revolutionary method; if it is a gradual improvement, it is called an evolutionary method. The so-called evolutionary method is nothing more than planning by staff, suggesting by supervisors, or deciding by meetings to improve. However, this kind of basis is difficult to adapt to the times and the environment, so it cannot be regarded as the only tool for revolutionary politics. I believe that the investigation committee valued by Europe and the United States is the best method for political revolution, and our country should vigorously promote it. Currently, the reports of various agencies lack conclusions and recommendations, so they cannot be compared with investigation reports. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM.

To avoid the tragedy of national destruction and family death, the only way is for the whole country to unite, support the central government, and obey the central government. Only then can we cope with the current national crisis and protect our country. The ancients said that adversity builds a nation, which is indeed true. Now the national crisis is becoming more urgent. Only the central government can lead comrades and compatriots across the country to continue to fight with a spirit of worry, diligence, vigilance, and unyielding spirit to save the country from disaster.

Xun died and Luo was injured. He also injured his left knee, and his left leg was later amputated by a doctor. Later, because he and a new bandit went to contact each other, food ran out, so he went down the mountain to find his troops and was captured on the way. He was also seriously injured and was dying. Fang Zhimin's remaining bandits have run out of food and ammunition and are about to be captured alive.

Since it is difficult to refuse their kindness, I will take the train from Tianjin to Shanghai in mid-next month, and in about twenty days, I will take the ship back to Russia. Also, Governor Sheng Shicai of Xinjiang Province telegraphed his representative, Zhang Cifu, hoping that I would visit Xinjiang on my way back to Russia. I have long had this intention, and if I have time after arriving in Russia, I will take a trip. As for Mei Lanfang's performance in Russia, they are very welcoming. Chinese opera has a history of many years, and although it is different from the arts of Europe and the West, it also has research value.

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Muyi, a special investigator sent by the Ministry of Justice to Xikang, went to Kang in the 22nd year to investigate justice, customs, and human feelings. Now that the matter is completed, he has returned to Beijing. Luo said that he was ordered to enter Kang for actual investigation for nearly two years. He had in-depth conversations with all the big and small chieftains, heads of temples, great lamas, and Buddhist governors. They all deeply hope that Nona Buddha will return to Kang to preside over religion and assist in the promotion of politics. The judiciary in Xikang is more advanced in counties such as Kangding and Guanding. Customs and habits in counties outside the border are different from those in the interior, so the court has not yet been established. People's lawsuits are handled by chieftains, headmen, thousand households, chief guarantors, village chiefs, or great lamas, such as directors, Kanbu, and Guanrong. The punishments are very cruel. The people of Xikang are hardworking and simple, and the area is rich in gold and silver. If methods are found to exploit them, not only can it fully supply the construction of a new Xikang, but it can also enrich the national wealth. There are currently many British and French people in Xikang. Although they were initially hated by the Kang people, they were all able to endure and use the opportunity to jointly operate various businesses with the Kang people. A Frenchman named Binsu has been in Kang for more than 30 years and is very familiar with the situation in Kang. He has compiled a French-Tibetan dictionary and has vowed to complete a French-Tibetan-Chinese glossary in twelve years. His knowledge of Tibetan language is unmatched by the Chinese. They have recently also founded schools, established hospitals, cultivated wasteland, and planted crops, and made a very detailed map of Xikang. However, Chinese officials and soldiers in Kang do not seem to be willing to study carefully. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hui</p>
<p>——A Further Explanation for the Tuberculosis Prevention Association——</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association, in view of the worrisome future of national health, has specially decided to implement tuberculosis prevention education starting this year. 1) Vaccinate primary school children with tuberculosis vaccine. 2) Public lectures and radio broadcasts. 3) Essay writing for tuberculosis prevention, and regularly expanding the recruitment of members. This is truly a special movement aimed at the overall health of our nation, which is both widespread and socially relevant. Since China opened its doors to the sea, it has suffered repeated setbacks. There is a lack of active and effective policies in politics and economics, and the general weakness of the national physique, which makes it difficult to win the fierce competition in the international arena, is one of the key reasons. This is something we cannot deny.</p>
<p>In today's advanced countries, from Western Europe to North America, the physique of the people is generally strong, and the average life expectancy is increasing year by year. People over forty enter their prime and begin to assume greater responsibilities for society and the nation. Therefore, their knowledge is more precise and their experience is richer. They are also able to clearly recognize their personal irrational preferences, such as indulging in pleasure and extravagance. They have a clear understanding of the distinction between public and private matters, so they are less likely to err and mislead the country due to temporary impulses. Only after physical health is sound can thinking and planning be thorough. Otherwise, they will be willing but unable, and their efforts will be in vain. The reasons why the Chinese age earlier and have weaker physical strength are that overwork or self-destruction are ultimately a minority and not a universal phenomenon of the nation. The main reasons for this decline are as follows:</p>
<p>China was originally an agricultural country. In recent decades, although major cities have become increasingly industrialized, the driving force of social economy is still in the countryside. However, the rural economy is declining, and urban industries cannot absorb the surplus population. The original market is shrinking. Shanghai, which concentrates the economic power of the whole country, is experiencing a market depression similar to that of other cities in the interior. Most of the people are poor, and they cannot even maintain their basic needs for food and clothing. If they cannot even guarantee their minimum standard of living, hygiene is just empty talk. They don't even have time to take care of their own well-being and death, so how can they engage in nutrition and hygiene? The weaker the national economic strength, the weaker the people's physical strength. This is the inevitable result. Responsible personnel in European countries are mostly over sixty, and their energy and depth of thought are no less than those of young people, and their knowledge and experience are even greater. Therefore, national strength is upward and developed, and even crises can be overcome by human effort. What about China? In the upper echelons, there are few people who are physically healthy, able to handle heavy responsibilities, unafraid of troubles, and persistent. In the middle class, there is also a phenomenon of self-defeat, which is deeply worrying. National health is a whole problem today, not just limited to tuberculosis or some other disease.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis prevention is one way to improve health and awaken the nation's attention to the prevention of such diseases. It is truly an urgent task of the day. However, if the Chinese people want to seek the overall health of the nation, they must not only pay attention to this matter, but also think fundamentally and strive to increase production and improve the overall national economic strength. It is necessary to improve the knowledge necessary for the lives of ordinary people, so that the general society can develop clean and strict habits, reduce unreasonable luxury consumption, and live in simple clothing and vegetarian food, which are hygienic everywhere. Then, the national physique will naturally become healthier day by day, and the resistance to the invasion of diseases can also be increased. Don't we see the example of neighboring Japan? Their personal physique is not necessarily stronger than ours, and their daily consumption is not particularly luxurious, but the health of their people is improving day by day. They have gradually escaped from the state of weakness and entered the path of strength. We should quickly wake up and be vigilant.</p>

<p>Inquiring About the True Intentions of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Chahar</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM on the 28th, and raised various questions regarding Foreign Minister Hirota's foreign policy speech in the Diet, the recent Chahar and Outer Mongolia incidents, and the situation in China, requesting to hear the Japanese government's intentions. The discussion lasted about an hour, until noon. Vice Minister Shigemitsu explained the main points to the British Ambassador as follows:</p>
<p>In concrete terms, Foreign Minister Hirota's speech expressed the hope that a border dispute mediation committee would be established with the Soviet Union. As for the Chahar incident, the Chinese side has corrected its attitude and is in close contact with the Kwantung Army to implement a local solution, so the problem has come to an end. The Outer Mongolia incident occurred because the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" was unclear. It has now been calmed down. If the Mongolian soldiers do not take active action, there will be no conflict. This matter has been reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Ambassador Minami in Manchuria.

<p>Japan's Abandonment of Treaty Leads to Arms Race</p>
<p>Hope to Reopen Negotiations to Conclude a New Agreement</p>
<p>(London) When Parliament reconvened this afternoon, the current naval situation was the first issue to be discussed. Prime Minister MacDonald, in response to a question, said that when the Tripartite Naval Conference adjourned on December 19 last year, the views of the participating governments had been presented and thoroughly discussed. The representatives at the meeting felt that the discussion had reached the stage where they should personally consult with their respective governments. The conversations had achieved their purpose, which was to enable the governments concerned to understand each other's problems and opinions, and to make suggestions for resolving existing difficulties. MacDonald continued that everything will continue to be conducted through diplomatic channels in the future. When the situation develops to the stage where talks can be reopened, the British government will take appropriate steps. Since the adjournment, the Japanese government has issued a formal notice terminating the Washington Treaty. The British government knew early on that extending the treaty beyond 1936 would violate the wishes of the Japanese government, but it felt that Britain deeply regretted Japan's termination of the treaty. He made this statement in accordance with the sincere and friendly spirit inherent between Britain and Japan. The treaty has supreme value in avoiding naval competition and eliminating all kinds of ill will and waste caused by competition. The British government believes that it would be a matter of great concern if a new method to limit the construction of future naval armaments could not be negotiated before the treaty expires. The British government was very pleased to hear the Japanese government's statement that it had no intention of pursuing naval expansion or disrupting the peaceful intentions of other countries. The Prime Minister said at the end that the Japanese government had stated that Japan was willing to participate in friendly negotiations as before in order to establish a fair and appropriate new agreement, thereby consolidating the relations of peace and friendship between countries.

<h3 id="e21">Japanese House of Peers Questions the Future of the Naval Conference <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Ōgaki Said to Have Resolute Determination</p>
<p>People Must Tighten Their Belts to Cope</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers convened at 10:30 this morning and began to deliberate on the speeches of the Ministers of State. First, Tsumura Kinshe took the stage. His question was: Foreign Minister Hirota stated in the provisional Diet that he would take appropriate measures regarding the incident of the exclusion of Japanese people in Arizona, USA, but the violence against the Japanese people in that area has not stopped. What is the attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this matter? Also, according to naval authorities, there will be no competition in shipbuilding after the breakdown of the disarmament conference, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that competition may or may not occur. Such inconsistent statements by the authorities easily make the people feel uneasy. Please ask the two ministers what their views are.</p>
<p>Tsumura then pointed out the inferiority of the Japanese air force compared to other countries, explained that the majority of heavy industries in other countries are aircraft manufacturing industries, and emphasized the necessity of the Japanese aircraft industry, iron and steel industry, and automobile industry before leaving the stage.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota was the first to reply, saying that the Arizona issue has improved recently due to the attention of the US government. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, Japan, in view of its mission of peace in the Far East, is striving to make all countries understand its true intentions. The true nature of Japanese diplomacy is not to deny the close relations between all countries in the world, and the greatest policy is to be friendly with all nations, especially the relations with Britain and the United States. As for the disarmament issue, he hopes that it will be successfully established and should not anticipate a breakdown and prepare for it. Regarding the issue of recovering the Russian embassy rights, because Russia owes debts to various countries, the issue of Japanese-Russian debt claims cannot be separated and a solution must be sought.</p>
<p>Naval Minister Ōgaki replied, (excerpted) We firmly believe that what Japan advocates is fair and appropriate, but if there are countries that arbitrarily expand their armaments and overturn this claim, then their intentions are not here but there, which is very obvious. Therefore, we must have a resolute determination, or even be prepared for the people to tighten their belts in unison. However, we should not guide the people to that tendency, so we are taking pains not to promote it. That is also one of the reasons why the Foreign Minister is enthusiastic about diplomatic work. Therefore, even if the disarmament conference breaks down, we should not make the mistake of thinking that it is unimportant because there are countermeasures. This must be avoided. (Excerpted) However, if the Washington and London Naval Treaties can continue to exist, then replacement ships will be built from the following year, which will require considerable funding. We should seek to adapt to the national conditions within the scope of the cost of building replacement ships, so as to rectify the substantial armaments and alleviate the sense of insecurity in national defense. We now repeatedly declare that in today's situation, we should avoid anticipating the breakdown of the disarmament conference and making various discussions. This is what we earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>Army Minister Hayashi replied that it is regrettable that Japan's aviation equipment is inferior to that of foreign countries. Although the army has budgeted for air defense in the ten-year to fourteen-year budget, this is by no means satisfactory. The unification of the air defense organization is currently under study. Finally, Minister Tokonami replied in succession, and the meeting adjourned at noon. (28th Japan United Press Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because of the uneasy atmosphere about dissolving or not dissolving the Diet due to the bomb motion, the House of Representatives budget general meeting convened at 10:30 AM on the 28th in a tense atmosphere. Okuchi Kiroku continued his questions as follows: Regarding the issue of local finances, we have considered the issue of land rent transfer, but today this method is not enough to save the rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary for the state to issue grants. National defense expenses and compulsory education expenses are all transferred to local autonomous organizations, so it is quite difficult to regenerate the local economy. Prime Minister Okada replied that the government is considering appropriate measures for this issue. Okuchi then changed the subject to question the rescue of the current situation, saying that the paltry ten-year budget could not save the impoverished rural areas. Okuchi also criticized the government's non-thorough attitude towards rescuing the current situation. Home Minister Goto then took the stage and began to reply that although some places felt slightly difficult after the government stopped issuing funds for rescuing the current situation, the purpose of the projects in the past three years has been achieved when viewed as a whole. The issue of repairing the majority of rivers across the country has not been started due to financial relations. Okuchi also asked about the education issue and the silkworm issue. At 12:17, there was a temporary recess. (28th Japan United Press Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Within the Seiyukai, opinions are not consistent on the measures to be taken after the bomb motion and whether or not to pursue the disciplinary issue of Tokonami Tsugou, and they are now divided into three factions: the hardliners, the self-respecters, and the Tokonami faction, who are opposed to each other and unfolding their internal struggle scene. The Niikai, which is considered the hardline faction, has already gathered at Ryukintei in Yanagibashi from 6:00 PM on the 28th. The Tokonami faction also held a mediator meeting at the Flying Club at 6:00 PM. On the other hand, the so-called self-respecting faction, the Kokusei Isshinkai, is scheduled to gather at San'entei at 3:00 PM on the 29th. From this point of view, the fluctuation within the party has gradually increased its degree. (28th Japan United Press Electric)</p>

<p>Russian Ambassador Carries Answer Back to His Post</p>
<p>Quickly Seek to Resolve Debt and Loan Issues</p>
<p>New Developments in US Trade</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, returned to his original post here today. Judging from the situation, the industrial products needed for the Soviet Russian industrialization plan, worth hundreds of millions of US dollars, may be purchased by the US government as an intermediary. The Russian ambassador has brought back with him from Moscow the answers to the US debt and the US loan to Russia. Mr. Troyanovsky stayed in Russia for four months and had detailed discussions with his government authorities. It is likely that he will meet with Secretary of State Hull this Monday. If the plan is realized, the factories that are deeply troubled by the economic panic will see great development. The US Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Bullitt, is currently here and will also assist in the negotiations. It is reported that Soviet Russia has long been purchasing goods in the United States, amounting to 100 million yuan per year, and will purchase particularly more in the next few years, about 500 to 600 million yuan. What is needed is mostly "means of production" to increase its industrial output, such as motors, mining machines, generators, machine tools, steel rails, locomotives, etc. Recently, Soviet Russia also announced that it plans to build a railway in Siberia. The US government is implementing the New Deal and originally wanted to restore the production of heavy industrial products, and the industrial sector has also changed its policy and is willing to cooperate with the government. The government has specially established an import and export bank for trade with Russia. As long as the US-Russian debt is resolved, it will be able to provide loans to US exporters. According to those familiar with the situation, Japan's abandonment of the Washington Naval Treaty and the resurgence of Far East disputes are one of the reasons for the government to improve its relations with Russia. Even the previous recognition of Soviet Russia is not unrelated to this. In addition, there is another point, namely that Soviet Russia produces a lot of gold. After purchasing goods, a large amount of it can flow into the United States. A ship was already transported to the United States last autumn, and there is also one currently being transported. Moreover, Soviet Russia's gold mines are inexhaustible, which should be sufficient to pay for the goods. (27th National Press Agency Electric)</p>

<p>(New York) Undersecretary of State Phillips said in a speech here today that if the current 5:5:3 naval ratio can still be maintained, the United States is willing to reduce its current naval strength. The US government believes that the only way to disarm without affecting the political and economic balance is to disarm based on the proportional system. Therefore, if there is a hope of success in negotiations based on this, the United States is willing to start negotiations. In addition, Phillips reiterated the US's determination to continue to uphold the Open Door Policy, saying that this is of a global nature, not simply an Orientalist theory.

Senior officials from the German Embassy in Poland and the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs were invited to accompany him. In the afternoon, Göring and his entourage departed for Białowieża, accompanied by Polish Minister of Justice Michałowski and Inspector-General of the Army.

Both sides are keeping the details of the talks strictly confidential, but according to well-informed sources, the content of the talks is related to armaments and other minor issues. Because Laval will depart for England in a few days to meet with British authorities, preparations must be made in advance so that the United Kingdom and France can continue to cooperate in a spirit of mutual trust and friendship.

<p>British Prime Minister's Special Envoy Describes Impressions of Visiting Germany</p>
<p>(London) Sir Allen, a close friend of Prime Minister MacDonald, visited German leader Hitler, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and Foreign Minister Neurath in Berlin. Allen spoke with the Daily Mail, saying that Germany is truly enthusiastic about genuine peace, and that if we can believe Germany's words and recognize it as an equal and autonomous nation, then Germany will still join the League of Nations for cooperation. However, if this matter is not addressed early, it will be regretted in a few years. According to the report, Allen's informal visits to Hitler and others have attracted considerable attention because he is a close friend of British Prime Minister MacDonald. Allen also expressed his impressions of Germany, saying that, in his view, Hitler's position in Germany is very stable and his sincerity is very admirable. During a long conversation with Hitler, he carefully examined his behavior and proved that Hitler is a man who strives for peace, but his goal is still to strive for Germany's equality and autonomy, because today's Germany is the only first-class country that is being discriminated against. As for Germany's fierce words and warmongering rhetoric, they are not its true intentions, but merely outrage after being treated unfairly. Germany's love of peace is because Germany knows that war is tantamount to self-destruction, and its postwar survivors are determined to stabilize the country internally and not seek external expansion. If France and Germany cannot reach a compromise, then the United Kingdom will be in a pivotal position, because the Germans still value the British very much. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Conflicting Opinions Among Various Factions on the Issue of Domestic Reform</p>
<p>⊙Budapest, the capital of Hungary, The political situation in Hungary is visibly uneasy. The most important domestic issues are the reform of the land system and the reform of elections. Hungarian political parties have different opinions on these issues and have formed their own factions. As a result, there may be repercussions for the government's position and the form of the National Assembly. Regarding the land system reform plan, the aristocratic party and the large landowners have expressed opposition, while the small farmers' party has expressed support. Prime Minister Gömbös currently has two options: either to make concessions to the aristocratic party and the large landowners so that the government faction can maintain its current majority, or to sacrifice a part of the government faction and rely on the small farmers' party to consolidate itself. Recently, Gömbös gave a speech in Szolnok, vehemently attacking the aristocratic party, but after meeting with Count Károlyi, the leader of the party, at a luncheon in a certain place, the two sides seemed to have reached a compromise. If the aristocratic party's opposition remains strong, Gömbös can still obtain a majority on the side of the small farmers' party. The leader of the party, Eckhardt (i.e., the Hungarian representative to the League of Nations), said that if the government wants to form an alliance with them, it should thoroughly change its policies and form a definite alliance. Regarding the issue of election reform, Eckhardt said, "I and General Gömbös have already agreed in detail, but what the attitude of the small farmers' party will be depends on whether Gömbös can make his party members obey."

<p>Securities ▲New York Before the opening of the New York stock market, a favorable factor for the market was that, according to the steel industry report's estimate, steel mills' work last week accounted for 53% of capacity. However, the recent increase in work was due to a decrease in inventory. Now that inventory is gradually increasing, it is expected that the output will be lower. Steel mills of the Yangtze River type account for 64% of production capacity this week and are expected to increase to 65% within ten days. An unfavorable factor for the market is the uncertainty of the foreign exchange market, which is alarming. This morning, when the stock market opened, various stocks mostly fell slightly. Steel stocks were loose, and merchants were unwilling to buy or sell, wanting to wait for the development of the situation. Securities trading seems likely to remain narrow. The prices are as follows:</p>

<p>⊙Guiyang (Title Abbreviated) Our country is unfortunate. Communist bandits are rampant. Wherever their evil influence reaches, the people are displaced, fields and houses are ruined, security is disturbed, and the party and the country are harmed more than ever. This time, the Jiangxi bandits fled westward, rushing like wolves and pigs, hoping to unite with the Xu bandits who fled to northern Sichuan and the Xiao He bandits in western Hunan to devastate the southwest. Our central government is concerned about the difficult times and has summoned a large army to pursue and suppress them day and night. Triumphant songs are played repeatedly, and the masses rejoice. Therefore, a Guizhou military and civilian joint celebration will be held on the 25th to connect the feelings between the military and the people and increase their mutual cooperation. However, the major villains and ringleaders are still awaiting public execution. It is hoped that the entire country will unite under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, concentrate its strength, unite the military and the people, thoroughly eliminate the remnant bandits, clarify official administration, and implement the revival of rural areas. Suppressing bandits is for saving the people, and internal stability can resist foreign aggression. Therefore, we will strive for the realization of the Three Principles of the People to achieve the completion of the national revolution. The future of the party and the country depends on it.

<p>—Liu Xiang's Report to the Financial Community—</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence. During the previous critical military period, there was unease in Sichuan's financial situation. As a result of the authorities' best efforts to provide relief, the situation has recently improved. Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression, convened a meeting with the financial community at the United Public Treasury the other day. Chen Shaowei, the Central Sichuan Finance Special Envoy, was also invited to attend. Liu gave a speech on the spot, in addition to announcing measures to reorganize finances, and also gave a very detailed account of the military deployment in eastern and southern Sichuan. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Proper Military Deployment. Liu of Shoushan said in his opening speech: "Since I returned from Beijing, I have had no opportunity to speak with you due to military matters. After two consultations with Special Envoy Chen regarding the financial issues in Sichuan, we have reached considerable solutions. As for military affairs, deployments have been properly completed. These two issues are what I want to talk about today, and I believe they are what you are interested in hearing. First, the military is now properly deployed and there is no other concern.</p>
<p>Measures to Reorganize Finance. Second, regarding the financial situation, the central government attaches great importance to Sichuan's finances and has promised subsidies. Sichuan is very grateful for the central government's care. However, the central government needs to investigate the situation in Sichuan to know the details. Therefore, Special Envoy Chen was specially dispatched to Sichuan to handle everything. In the future, Sichuan's finances will definitely have a complete solution. This can be stated with certainty. Due to the previous serious military situation, many disputes arose in the financial sector of this city due to the soaring of foreign water Shen Hui. Fortunately, with the sympathy and maintenance of all parties, we overcame the difficulties. However, the bandit suppression military operations have not yet been completed, so there will naturally be more problems in the future. If we only care about electing debts, then military expenses will be insufficient. If we only care about military expenses, then we will not be able to consider the losses of creditors. After careful consideration, we have come up with several conditions that are most important: 1) Reorganization of finances. The measures are: 1. Issue long-term public bonds of 120 million yuan. 2. Past debts will be repaid over ten years, interest rates will be reduced, monthly interest will be six li, interest will be paid in July, and principal will be repaid in June. This change is purely due to the bandit suppression military operations and is out of necessity. I hope that all parties will take the overall situation into account and make concessions to maintain it. I will be absolutely responsible. 2) Reorganize local bank notes. The measures are: 1. Local bank notes will not be allowed to be issued from today. Ten-yuan and five-yuan notes will be sealed up. 2. In the future, land bank notes will be used to offset loan certificates, and one thousand yuan of land bank notes will be sealed up. 3. The Finance Department will concentrate cash in other counties to exchange for land bank notes. 4. The Finance Department has been instructed to collect and destroy all ten-yuan and five-yuan notes. This method will be submitted to the central government and it is hoped that it will be adopted. It has been submitted to Special Envoy Chen to report to the central government," he said.</p>
<p>Speech by Special Envoy Chen. After Liu finished speaking, Special Envoy Chen continued to speak, saying that the central government attaches great importance to Sichuan's military and political affairs, and specially dispatched his brother to Sichuan to assist in everything regarding financial issues, and that it will be handled after considering the local situation. The proposed plan will be forwarded to the central government and there will be a complete solution. Then, Liu Hangchen, Director of the Finance Department, expressed his views, and the financial community spoke in succession. The meeting lasted four hours before it adjourned.</p>

<p>▲Resolution to Establish a Temporary Shelter</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: The Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society held its eighth council meeting on the 27th. Items discussed included: 1) The chairman reported on Zhou Xuewen's proposal to open a shelter to relieve Zhejiang drought-stricken refugee transients, requesting retroactive approval.

Expenses: The branch will advance 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Xu Jingyang, an economic committee member of the branch, will advance one shi of white rice to start operations. Zhou Xuewen will request assistance from the head office and the Relief Committee. 2) Appoint Zhu Guanghan, Yang Bingwen, Du Shiting, Yu Henian, Zheng Hanqing, Qian Jiamin, and Du Lianhua as members of the branch's asset committee. Qu Bingchang, Qian Mingquan, and Xu Jingyang as members of the branch's economic committee. Resolution: passed. 3) Nominations for administrative staff. Resolution: Zhu Jiuwang and Wang Ruozhou were nominated as directors. Huang Xiaohe and Wang Xichuan as clerks. Bai Guanlan, Du Lianhua, Xia Fengchi, Yu Shanjing, Wang Mingfu, and Wu Yinzi as staff members. Staff members will be appointed at the discretion of the directors, and workers will also be hired by the directors. Chen Nianci was appointed as head of publicity, Zhang Shaoxiu and Ke Dehuan as heads of Western medicine, and Xu Jingyang and Xia Jinghan as heads of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Fundraising will be undertaken by members of the branch. 4) Nomination of accounting staff. Resolution: Xia Fengchi was nominated as accountant. 5) Nomination of temporary economic management personnel. Resolution: Du Lianhua and Du Ruozhou nominated to manage. 6) Write letters to the leaders of various agencies and major philanthropists requesting assistance for the branch's shelter for Zhejiang drought-stricken refugee transients. Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>After the Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society resolved to establish a refugee shelter, it also telegraphed the Shanghai office of the National Government Relief Committee, requesting approval for implementation. The telegram is recorded below: "To Chairman Xu Jun of the Shanghai Office of the National Government Relief Committee: In recent times, no fewer than several thousand refugees from Zhejiang, including Xiashi, Wangdian, and Haining Tongxiang, have fled to Songjiang one after another. They are visible everywhere in the streets and alleys. They are starving and freezing, and their condition is miserable. Our association cannot bear to stand by and watch thousands of refugees become homeless, and we fear that undesirable elements may take the opportunity to sneak in, which could jeopardize local security. Therefore, we convened an emergency meeting and, after a public resolution, decided to establish a temporary Zhejiang drought-stricken refugee transit shelter and sent Director Zhou Xuewen to your committee to negotiate. We are deeply grateful that Standing Committee Member Wang Yiting and other committee members agreed to send the refugees onwards. Now, our association has earnestly requested large philanthropists who generously donated to the Bingzi and Dingmao wartime disasters to first find ways to raise funds and start operations. It is scheduled to open a shelter at Chaoguo Temple in Songjiang on the 31st to accommodate refugees. At the same time, our association will conduct separate fundraising activities so that thousands of refugees can escape freezing and starvation. In addition to reporting to the headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society, we hereby urgently telegraph your committee to request approval for implementation. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Sheng Yuan, President of the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and Zhu Jiuwang, respectfully. "</p>
<p>Attached is a letter from the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society: "Dear Editor, In the Songjiang correspondence in your newspaper of January 27th, there is a paragraph that reads: 'Shanghai gentlemen have come to Songjiang to accommodate refugees, and it has been agreed with Shanghai charitable magnates Xu Shiying and Wang Yiting to allocate 10,000 taels of silver.' This does not correspond to the facts. Our branch director Zhou Xuewen contacted Mr. Wang Yiting of Shanghai regarding the issue of future repatriation. The allocation of 10,000 taels of silver is completely untrue. We hereby request a correction. Sincerely, Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, January 27th."</p>
<p>Songjiang Tinglin Xiahengjing Robbery</p>
<p>Xu Jinsheng's home, a farmer from Qitu, Xiahengjing, Tinglin, was suddenly attacked by more than ten local-speaking bandits armed with shotguns, wooden sticks,刺刀 (bayonets),麻繩 (hemp ropes), and other weapons around midnight on the 25th. They pried open the gate and entered. First, they forced Xu's mother (63 years old) to hand over her hidden silver, but failed and injured her in the process. They then entered each room and robbed eight shi of white rice, two cotton quilts, and many items of clothing, which they loaded onto a boat and escaped. However, because the victim knew that the perpetrators were local bandits, he did not want to cause trouble and did not report the incident. Later, he was pressured by public opinion to report to the First Sub-bureau, requesting that they be apprehended.</p>
<p>Wuxi Telegram Requesting the Cancellation of Silkworm Seed Control</p>
<p>The local Silkworm Seed Industry Association, citing reports that Jiangsu Province has revised its silkworm seed control measures, stating that this year's seed prices will be uniformly set at 6 jiao by the government for factories, and 4 jiao when sold to the public. However, if various farms have the ability to sell to external markets, they may operate freely, selling at 4 jiao within the province, etc. It is clear that the silkworm seed control management measures are beginning to waver. However, the purpose of the control management is to preserve the strength of the people and promote the progress of the domestic silkworm industry, preventing abnormal growth and blind competition among enterprises, based on the absolute unification of production and distribution. If various farms are allowed to sell freely, it will revert to the state of competitive commodity sales and unplanned distribution, and the effectiveness of control management will be lost. Therefore, yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Provincial Government's Department of Construction, requesting that the distribution methods for this year's spring seeds be clearly indicated, and that thorough control management be strictly implemented. If thorough control management cannot be established, the effect of improvement will be difficult to achieve. We hope that the government will save the country's financial resources and explicitly order the cancellation of control management, abolish the Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee, and not leave this redundant agency, so that it may be a blessing to the people.</p>
<p>Jiashan Truth of the Gan Yao Massacre</p>
<p>In Xuejiawan, Hedong Dai, Gan Yao Town, Chen, wife of Zhang Kecai from Zhenjiang, 36 years old, rented her womb to Qiu Azhong from Ningbo several years ago to bear a child. She had rented out capital of 200 yuan, which had been redeemed at the expiration of the lease period before the incident. The night before her death, Chen asked her husband for one yuan, but Kecai replied that he had no money, which led to an argument. That night, Chen died tragically. The county court paid close attention to this matter and sent officials to the countryside to examine the body. The examination revealed that the deceased had knife marks on all parts of her head and face, and that her genitals had been cut open with a knife. A bamboo knife stained with blood was found in Zhang Kecai's home. The body has now been discarded next to Qiu Azhong's house. Qiu Azhong and his wife, as well as the deceased's husband, Zhang Kecai, have been escorted to the court for interrogation. The truth will not be difficult to uncover.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Enemy or Friend? (3) (Continued) Xu Daolin <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>—An Examination of Sino-Japanese Relations—</p>
<p>—Xu Daolin</p>
<p>(2) The Error of the Asian Monroe Doctrine: A careful observation of Japan's actions over the past three years reveals that the Japanese intend to overcome their domestic difficulties through outward expansion and hegemony. The first step is to achieve the position of absolute ruler of Asia, thereby constantly revealing their aspirations for an East Asian Monroe Doctrine, both internally and externally. However, we ultimately believe that 1935 is different from 1826, when the United States sang the Monroe Doctrine. Not only is the era different, but the situation is also completely different. Because Britain and France did not have such significant and deep-seated interests in the Americas at that time, and they were geographically separated by vast oceans, the means of transportation and technology were not as advanced as they are today. Therefore, the Americans were allowed to sing "America for Americans" and effectively control the politics and economy of two continents with one country. But in fact, the United States has had to abandon the Monroe Doctrine policy. Now, if Japan sings the Asian Monroe Doctrine to facilitate control of China, then before China is detached from its semi-colonial status, the European and American countries have intricate and profound political and economic interests in China, and even have a profound impact militarily. If Japan now wants to exclude the nations, placing China under absolute control with the slogan of "East Asia for East Asians", not only will the United States and Russia be hostile to Japan, but all European countries will be hostile to Japan, especially conflicting with British interests. The United States' control of the Americas was achieved after the American Revolutionary War and the acquisition of the dominant position. Japan's strength is the result of British conservation. This is something that the Japanese and the British cannot forget. Now, if Japan blatantly disregards this and considers itself the master of East Asia, the result will not only be that the whole world will be Japan's enemy.</p>
<p>(3) The Error of Self-Created Illusions: In order to encourage and spur on its people and unify domestic public opinion, Japan has previously pointed to Manchuria as Japan's lifeline for various exaggerated and untrue reasons. After the September 18th Incident, it further argued that its invasion of China was unavoidable because Japan's survival was threatened. At the same time, it frantically shouted to the Japanese people about its unprecedented national crisis, without considering that this kind of national crisis, even if it existed, was created by Japan itself. If it wanted to resolve it, it would be as easy as turning its mind around. Japan often accuses China of implementing anti-Japanese education. In fact, apart from narrating the history of national humiliation, China has not had any profound anti-Japanese education. Japan, on the other hand, has created illusions and instilled a deep-seated anti-Chinese mentality in its people, almost injecting the mentality of "either China or Japan" into the minds of every Japanese youth and child. This kind of creation of common and deep illusions to facilitate temporary national policies will have extremely serious consequences. From the facts, if Japan truly cares about its survival and development, the current approach can be said to be counterproductive. Because if Japan cannot completely eliminate China and leave no one alive, today's blatant disregard will never be like the destruction of Korea under the dynasty. It has been thirty years since Korea fell, but the Korean people today cannot be said to truly belong to Japan. Now, if it invades China to the end, permanently occupies Manchuria, or expands its scope further, and on the other hand uses piecemeal control methods to put China to death, then the Chinese people will not forget it even after three hundred years, let alone thirty years. This is a deep hatred that will last for generations in the closely adjacent China, and this is the threat to Japan's long-term survival. On the other hand, if Japan truly has the sincerity to automatically renew its national relations, then the difficult problems of the survival of the Japanese people can easily be solved by resolving Sino-Japanese pending issues, establishing Sino-Japanese relations, and seeking extremely reasonable solutions for maintaining peace in the Orient. China and Japan are geographically and ethnically close, and their customs and habits are also slightly similar. Just looking at the happy family relationships of those who marry between the two countries and the close and harmonious interactions between ordinary Chinese and Japanese businessmen, it can be seen that they are brothers and there is no reason why they cannot cooperate. The good example of self-strengthening and self-reliance in the Japanese Meiji Restoration gave the awakened Chinese people a lot of encouragement. China does not deny Japan's advanced achievements in academia, culture, industry, and economy. China is now in a period of revival and nation-building and urgently needs economic and cultural support. The Japanese people's hardworking and frugal habits are also suitable for cooperation with China. What Japan lacks may be seen as surplus in China. Conversely, what Japan can supply may be what China needs. Therefore, economically speaking, if the two countries can truly support each other on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, the problems of the survival and development of the two peoples can be completely solved.</p>
<p>Thinking calmly, there is really no need to restrict and restrain each other to move towards extinction together. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Safety Issue of Transporting Antiquities to England for Exhibition is Resolved <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>A Preview Exhibition Will Be Held in Shanghai Starting on the 15th of Next Month</p>
<p>An Antiquities Storage in Nanjing will be Completed Next Spring</p>
<p>The International Exhibition of Chinese Art is scheduled to open in England in November of this year. To ensure the matter is handled with the utmost care, the government has specially ordered the establishment of a Preparatory Committee to oversee it. It was also decided that a preview exhibition would be held in Shanghai three months before the antiquities are shipped, and another exhibition would be held in Shanghai when the antiquities are returned to China next year before being transported to Nanjing for storage. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Safety Concerns The Chinese Art Exhibition is being held in England this year. This initiative was proposed by the British and only became a reality with the agreement of our government. However, the academic communities in both the North and South of China attach great importance to the transportation of these antiquities to England. They have also issued opinions and suggestions to the government, urging careful handling to prevent any loss of these cultural treasures and historical relics. In response, the government has specifically instructed the London Chinese Art Exhibition Committee to thoroughly investigate the safety measures for transporting the antiquities to England and submit a report for approval. The Preparatory Committee held its fourth meeting in Nanjing yesterday, where decisions were made regarding the procedures for packing and shipping the antiquities, as well as safety during transportation and exhibition. The British side will be fully responsible for everything after the antiquities leave the country. All plans will be communicated to the British side through our embassy in England by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Preview Exhibition Regarding the preview exhibition to be held in Shanghai within three months, the Preparatory Committee has specifically invited several members from Shanghai and requested Mayor Wu's assistance and guidance. Pan Gongzhan will serve as the honorary secretary in Shanghai. After Pan located the old site of the Bank of China for rental, he immediately consulted with the Preparatory Committee in Nanjing via long-distance telephone and reached an agreement. Starting from the 15th of this month, personnel will be dispatched to arrange the exhibition site, which includes the first, second, and third floors. As for the selection of antiquities, the Preparatory Committee will send special committee member and Secretary-General Yang Zhensheng to Shanghai next month to select items from the Palace Museum warehouse with Chairman Wang Yunwu and others.</p>
<p>Construction of the Storage Facility Separately, according to antiquities inventory specialist Shu Chushi, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the antiquities will be transported to Nanjing for storage after the exhibition in England next year. The construction of the antiquities storage facility in Nanjing has been decided to take place at the Chaotian Palace in Nanjing. The construction budget has been set at 600,000 yuan. It is learned that the government has already allocated 200,000 yuan to start construction, which is expected to be completed next spring. Once the inventory of the antiquities stored in Shanghai is completed, they will all be transported to Nanjing for storage.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, regarding the case of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce's letter received on the 26th of this month, proposing to petition the Ministry of Industry to establish a large factory in Beiping to benefit industrial construction, a copy of the original proposal is attached. We request a unified stance and request the Ministry to proceed accordingly." Upon investigation, the city of Beiping has been extremely depressed since the relocation of the capital to the south. Recently, due to the Liaoshen Incident and unrest in the Luan East area, refugees have flocked to the former capital. Although the population has increased, the number of poor people unable to make a living is also increasing daily. Considering the situation there, it has become the first line of national defense. It is essential to ensure that the people have sufficient means of livelihood and employment so that internal stability can secure the external. In recent years, your Ministry has been meticulously planning national factories. If the Ministry can first establish a factory in Beiping based on the suitability of its products, it will serve as a catalyst, and merchants and residents from all over will be inspired to invest in succession, which will undoubtedly be more enthusiastic. This is extremely important for the prosperity of the former capital. Respectfully, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Results of Physical Examinations of School-Age Children by the Anti-Tuberculosis Association <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Younger Children are Physically Healthier</p>
<p>Adults in the North are Physically Stronger than Those in the South</p>
<p>China has long been known as the "Sick Man of East Asia," and the number of people suffering from lung diseases is especially high. Local medical experts, aware of this, have initiated the organization of the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association. A reporter from Guomin News visited Mr. Zhang Junjun, the executive director of the Association, yesterday to inquire about the results of the Association's school-age children's disease seedling tests, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tuberculosis Seedling Tests Reveal Weak Children According to Mr. Zhang, a total of 385 school-age children were tested this time. Medical officers from the Association's First Tuberculosis Clinic conducted the tests. The results of the tests are as follows: Among the 3 tested under the age of 5, one had a positive reaction and two had negative reactions. The positive reaction rate was 33.30%. Among the 180 children aged 6 to 10, 98 had positive reactions and 82 had negative reactions. The positive reaction rate was 54.40%. Among the 194 children aged 11 to 15, 52 had positive reactions and 42 had negative reactions. The positive reaction rate was 60.35%. Among the 5 individuals over the age of 16, four had positive reactions and one had a negative reaction. The positive reaction rate was 80.00%.</p>
<p>Northerners are Healthier, Southerners are Weaker According to Mr. Zhang, tuberculosis is not hereditary. Judging from this test, it is known that the phenomenon of increased response to germ tests in school-age children increases with age. After testing Chinese people over the age of 20, those with positive reactions account for as much as 98%. The weakness of the Chinese people's physique is evident from this. For example, last year, the Ministry of Education inspected the development of college students nationwide. Among 1,632 students at Peking University, 109 were classified as first-class development. Among 1,608 students at Sichuan University, only 499 were classified as first-class development. Among 1,285 students at Central University, only 278 were classified as first-class development. Furthermore, Kong Ershi of Peking University conducted 2,049 tuberculosis seedling tests, and the results showed that 231 had positive reactions, accounting for 30%. Lai of Shanghai Medical College conducted 4,703 tuberculosis seedling tests, and the results showed that 2,821 had positive reactions, accounting for 60%. From this, it can be seen that the percentage of southern students infected with tuberculosis germs is 60%, while the percentage of northern students is only 30%. Southerners are physically weaker than Northerners. Mr. Zhang also said that the proportion of Chinese people suffering from lung diseases is 4%, while in the United States, only 78 out of 100,000 people have lung diseases.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Report on Huai'ning Relief Efforts by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The drought was quite severe in Anhui Province. Gentry and merchants from Anqing, along with foreigners residing in the area, organized a temporary relief association and sent representatives to Shanghai to solicit aid, pleading with tears in their eyes. The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee allocated 3,000 yuan, and the Jisheng Society contributed 2,000 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan for relief. According to the letter received, an investigation was conducted in the most severely affected areas of Huaining: Zongpu, Yanshan, Guanyinbao, Wayaoyin, Shaqiao, Hengshanyan, Wuxianmiao, Nuanshuisi, Hongmiao, Lingquan, and Shibaoli. The neediest drought victims, including the elderly and young children, were identified, limited to 1,000 people. Each person was to receive 5 yuan in relief, distributed over four months: 2 yuan in the first month and 1 yuan in each of the following three months. However, the investigation teams witnessed truly tragic situations in various districts. The current relief funds are meager, like a drop in the bucket, insufficient to sustain them. They urgently hope for more fundraising efforts. A report on the conditions of drought victims in the countryside is summarized below. According to the provincial government's on-site investigation of the drought in Anhui Province last year, 49 out of 60 counties were affected. The affected farmland totaled 18,161,426 mu, and the loss of rice was estimated at 50,489,356 shi, with a value loss of over 280 million yuan. The drought-affected population was estimated at 8,718,540 people. Elders say that even the great drought of the sixth year of the Xianfeng reign during the Qing dynasty was not as severe as this; it is truly a rare and unprecedented disaster. As the harsh winter approaches, the livelihoods of the drought victims are even more dire and in imminent danger. Therefore, provincial authorities initiated a winter relief fundraising campaign, calling upon various groups and charities to contribute enthusiastically. The Tianzhutang South Association in the city, deeply concerned about the plight of the refugees, dispatched He Xuren, Liu Hengwang, and Fei Wenbin on January 10th to distribute relief tickets and clothing to Guanyinbao, Wayao, Hengshan, Wuxian, Hongmiao, Lingquan, and other places. Although the work is now complete, we feel compelled to write this report to inform the readers of the suffering of the drought victims. The third to seventh districts of Huaining County are mostly hilly and prone to drought. Unexpectedly, last year's drought caused enormous losses, with an estimated 264,760 mu of farmland affected and 402,530 people suffering. The loss of rice, beans, wheat, and other crops amounted to 661,800 shi. In all the places we visited, the fields were barren, and the livelihoods of farmers were on the verge of collapse. Beggars selling their children and wives were a common sight by the roadside. The most tragic situations were in Lingquan and other places bordering Huaining and Wangjiang. Nine out of ten farmers had nothing left. The draft animals died. The elderly and weak awaited death, and the strong fled. The daily life of residents mainly consisted of filling their stomachs with radishes and daylily. The most impoverished boiled and ate sweet potato leaves, fertilizer grass, malt, duckweed, and manicao grass. Some even dried and ground coarse bran, oil tree bark, and flaxseed roots to make porridge. There were even those who ate Guanyin clay and committed suicide by taking poison or hanging themselves. The drought victims lived crammed together in one bed with several family members, with only a bundle of straw and tattered cotton wadding for bedding. The suffering caused by the severe cold is unimaginable. If the authorities delay in providing adequate assistance, the drought victims will be left to die.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Red Swastika Society Welcomes Chairman Xiong Shihui <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The three chairmen of the Red Swastika Society, Xiong Xiling, Zhang Lanping, and Han Shichang, held a tea party at their office in the Zhonghe Village on Bubbling Well Road on the afternoon of the 27th to welcome Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. Attendees included Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Zhu Qinglan, Guan Gangzhi, Huang Bodu, and over fifty key staff members of the society. Xiong Xiling delivered a welcome speech, stating that the Jiangxi disaster was quelled thanks to Chairman Jiang's prowess and Chairman Xiong's resilience. Not only did the people of Jiangxi benefit, but the people of all provinces also felt fortunate. He expressed his gratitude for Chairman Xiong's guidance and support during the society's dispatch of a relief team to Jiangxi. However, due to the severity of the disaster in Jiangxi, the limited resources of the society and other drought relief organizations in various provinces may not be sufficient to provide widespread assistance. The clothing, rice, medicine, salt, cloth, and other supplies that the society has transported can only address the symptoms. The fundamental relief measures, such as rural reconstruction and educational advancement, rely on the government to take swift action so that the people of Jiangxi can live and work in peace. This is what Xiling earnestly prays for. Chairman Xiong then rose and stated that the Red Swastika Society, driven by the spirit of mutual aid and love, dispatched a relief team of over 100 people to provide aid in Jiangxi. He expressed his respect for Chairmen Zhou, Han, and Li for personally visiting the disaster areas and exhausting their financial resources. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the people of Jiangxi. The tragic situation in various parts of Jiangxi has already been witnessed by everyone and need not be elaborated on. The government has separately handled relief, burial, medical care, and rural construction. However, Jiangxi's finances are exhausted after the great chaos, and it is difficult to balance everything. He hopes that all sectors of society will provide assistance with the same spirit and determination as the society, so that the tens of millions of drought victims in Jiangxi can all be relieved. He bowed deeply to plead for the disaster victims. The guests and hosts parted on amicable terms after 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Funds Handed Over to the Famine Relief Association for Distribution</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others, considering the severity of the drought in various provinces and the plight of the disaster victims, who are suffering from cold weather, lack of clothing, and food, were deeply moved. In addition to soliciting relief funds from philanthropists and sending them to the municipal Famine Relief Association of Various Provinces for distribution to the disaster areas, they, along with Zhang Weiru, donated 20,000 yuan to the Liuyide Hall in Huzhou yesterday. The funds were handed over to the aforementioned Famine Relief Association on Yunnan Road for distribution, aiming to help the disaster victims.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Bank of China Relocates and Forms Old Building Management Committee <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Construction Plans Still Undecided</p>
<p>The Bank of China, formerly located at 22 The Bund, planned to relocate due to the age of the building and rebuild it. They selected the building at 50 Hankou Road, but the ongoing road elevation project at that location caused transportation inconvenience, delaying the move until yesterday. A Central News Agency reporter visited the new bank premises yesterday and spoke with the head of the General Affairs Department, learning the details of the relocation as follows:</p>
<p>Relocation in Stages　Due to the large number of departments in the bank, simultaneous relocation would be difficult. Therefore, it was carried out in two stages. The first stage, involving the General Management Department, was completed yesterday (the 28th). Other departments, such as the Foreign Exchange Department, the Shanghai Branch, and the Trust Department, continue to operate at the original location. They will be relocated during the three-day lunar New Year holiday on February 5th, 6th, and 7th, and will resume normal operations at the new location from February 8th.</p>
<p>Allocation of New Building　The new building has four floors, and the allocation of office space is as follows: (Ground Floor) Business Hall, Foreign Exchange Department, Trust Department, Manager's Office, Deputy Manager's Office; (First Floor) Insurance Company, Shanghai Branch Document Section, Regional Branch, Securities Department, Securities Department Custody Section, Inspection Committee; (Second Floor) Board of Directors Office, General Manager's Office, General Secretary's Office, Chief Auditor's Office, Personnel Office, General Affairs Department, Business Investigation Department, Inspection Office, Business Management Office First Section, Business Management Second Section, Business Management Third Section; (Third Floor) General Ledger Room, Economic Research Office, Stock Affairs Office, Building Department Supervisor's Office, General Affairs Department Materials Section Dining Hall.</p>
<p>Management of Old Building　Regarding the old building at 22 The Bund, the bank has appointed seven members from various departments to form the Old Building Management Committee. The committee will decide on matters such as demolition, design, and bidding for the old building. It is said that after the bank has completely moved out, a certain organization intends to borrow the premises for an exhibition, but only for a short period. As for how to rebuild, how many floors to build, when to demolish, and when to construct, nothing has been decided yet, as the Public Works Department will impose various restrictions on the construction of the new building, such as the number of floors and land concessions, and negotiations will take time.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Grand Opening of the Guangdong Bank's New Building <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Located at 52 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, the new building of the Guangdong Bank has been completed. The grand opening ceremony will be held this morning. At that time, the bank's entrance will surely be bustling with activity, reaching its peak. The bank has a history of over 30 years, established in the early years of the Republic of China. Five years after the establishment of the Hong Kong headquarters, a branch was set up in Shanghai. The capital has increased from 2 million Hong Kong dollars to over 11 million Hong Kong dollars. Since its establishment in Shanghai, the bank has held the economic pivot between China and foreign countries in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. Foreign merchants used to handle the exchange of various currencies in China, but the bank has been engaged in foreign exchange business with painstaking effort, gradually competing with foreign banks. The current leaders of the bank are Li Yutang and Zhang Rongpu, among others, with foresight and vision, and their future business will surely prosper.</p>

<p>Shen Shuying, a great philanthropist from western Zhejiang, is eager to do good and is unwilling to fall behind others in carrying out charitable causes. Countless villagers in the surrounding areas have benefited from his actions. In recent years, due to rural bankruptcy, various charitable organizations in the interior have successively ceased operations. The gentry in Xiaoshi, recognizing this, especially recommended Mr. Shen to take on the difficult task. Mr. Shen has been planning meticulously and struggling to maintain operations for three years. This year, the drought in the entire Haining County is the most severe, making the economic situation even more difficult. The relief center, the infant care center, and the Guangshan Hall are not only overcrowded, but also lack daily funding. However, the disaster victims are waiting to be fed and cannot wait any longer. Mr. Shen has been running around everywhere, but due to crop failures and setbacks, raising funds is extremely difficult. Currently, the Xianni Kunqu Opera Troupe is in its off-season. Mr. Shen has specially invited the troupe to accompany the most famous Pingsheng Music Society from Shanghai for three days of joint performances in Xiaoshi on the 29th, 30th, and 31st of this month. It is said that Mr. Shen and his sons will also perform on stage to raise funds for the three charitable organizations.</p>

<p>Since its opening, the number of poor people seeking shelter at the Shanghai South Charity Shelter has been increasing daily. The Chaohui Villa and Chaozhou Guild Hall have already accommodated over 2,700 people. Donations of funds, clothing, and bedding from various sectors have been very enthusiastic in recent days, as detailed in various newspapers. Yesterday (the 27th), the First Women's Wounded Soldier Hospital in the city donated all 265 of its stored blankets to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association at the Renji Charity Hall on Six Ma Road for distribution to the shelter for relief. However, since the snowfall the day before yesterday, the number of poor people seeking shelter has increased dramatically, leading to severe overcrowding. Therefore, there may not be enough clothing and bedding. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously to help the poor and the needy get through the end of the year, which would be a truly immeasurable act of merit.</p>

<p>From February 9th to March 24th</p>
<p>Enjoy Plum Blossoms in Hangzhou, Linping, and Wuxi</p>
<p>The plum blossoms in Hangzhou, Linping, and Wuxi are all famous and have their own characteristics. In Hangzhou, in addition to the plum blossoms planted by the recluse Lin Bu's wife on Gushan Mountain, there are the five-colored plum blossoms of Lingfeng. Linping has the ancient Song plum blossoms of Luying. As for the plum blossoms of the Meiyuan Garden in Wuxi, they are especially known for their abundant branches and lush clusters, and have long been widely praised. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, considering that the plum blossoms in various places along the railway line are about to bloom, and those who wish to visit and admire them will surely be enthusiastic, have prepared plum blossom viewing tours on both lines. The plum blossom viewing period will be from February 9th to March 24th, with Hangzhou, Linping, and Wuxi as the destinations. During this period, it is said that the railway administration will assign staff at each station to guide tourists and provide various conveniences to plum blossom viewing travelers. In addition, a plum blossom photography competition will be held simultaneously, and prizes will be awarded to the winners to increase interest and leave memories. The Traffic Department of the administration is currently compiling a plum blossom viewing publication with very detailed content, which will be distributed to various sectors. It is expected that the publication will be released in about ten days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange held its 18th annual shareholders' meeting at its location on Aidoa Road on the afternoon of the 27th at 3:00 PM. Over fifty people, including Gu Xinyi, attended. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Gu Xinyi, and important proposals were discussed. The following is a summary: (1) The rental arrears for the property on Minkuo Road, due up to the end of March 1934, amounted to 5,219.83 yuan. After deducting the 2,400 yuan received, 2,819.83 yuan remains outstanding. The board of directors should be urged to collect the arrears promptly. (2) Since the Exchange took over the collection of rent for the property on Minkuo Road, Dongming and Tongxing still owe rent. Although there are methods, they must be collected urgently. In addition to the existing lease agreements and rent books, the board of directors should handle the matter in accordance with the City Police Bureau's rent collection regulations. (3) Regarding the mortgage on the Taishan Wheel, as the wheel has now sunk, how should it be dealt with? Please have the board of directors handle it. (4) The long-term debt of Hua Da handled by the Exchange Federation has not been repaid with interest for two years. Please have the board of directors urge its collection. (5) Regarding the large sum of over 15,000 yuan previously owed in the name of Broker No. 14, are the repayment procedures legal? Please have the board of directors provide a clear explanation.</p>

<p>The weather in North China is colder, and Tianjin is already icebound. Merchant ships traveling from Tanggu Port to Baihe River are now using icebreakers for navigation. It is more difficult for Shanghai's Northern Ocean liners to navigate the Baihe River upon arrival in Tianjin. The local shipping companies decided yesterday after public discussion that from February 1st, i.e., Friday, all goods shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin will be subject to an icebound fee, which will be an additional 20% of the original freight rate. All companies have already notified the customs brokers and shippers to take note of this.</p>

<p>Ling Zhixiang, a rickshaw puller from Taixing, residing at No. 8 Renshou Lane, Lane 125, Caishi Road, French Concession, is 34 years old this year. He lives alone in Shanghai pulling a rickshaw. At 2:30 PM on the 27th, Ling was pulling his rickshaw on Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, heading east. At No. 76 on that road, a garbage truck No. 717 of the French Public Works Department, driven by Xu Lianhai, from Jiangbei, was traveling in the same direction from behind. Due to the driver's negligence, Ling was knocked down, and the rear wheel of the truck ran over Ling's lower body, causing his leg bones to be broken. The police officer saw this and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died four hours later. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang of the Second Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor and a clerk, arrived at the scene to verify that the deceased died from being run over by a car before his death. As the matter pertained to his home village, and he had no relatives in Shanghai, the car owner, Wang Yanzhi, came forward to request to claim the body for burial. After the official interrogated the defendant about the circumstances of the accident, he approved Wang Yanzhi's request to claim the body for burial. The defendant was sent to the hospital for questioning by the police department. It is said that the police will send the defendant to court today for interrogation. Regarding the damages to the deceased, the defendant has asked someone to contact the car owner to discuss compensation with the deceased's family.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Municipal Ferry Double-Decker Pier Opens <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Floating Restaurant to Open Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Trust Company's double-decker pier, located on the Bund near Beijing Road, has opened yesterday. The floating restaurant is in the planning and arrangement stage. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Double-Decker Pier Opened Yesterday　For the purpose of developing the ferry business, the Shanghai Industrial and Trust Company built a double-decker steel-framed pier on the Bund near Beijing Road, at the Municipal Council Pier. The construction was completed on the 12th of this month, but it was repeatedly postponed due to the widening of the original pedestrian walkway. It finally opened yesterday. The pier has a novel and solid structure and a magnificent appearance. The entire building has two floors. The upper floor houses the management office and passenger waiting room, and the lower floor houses the ticket office, small shops, and a passenger waiting room, so that passengers can rest before boarding or after disembarking. The south end of the pier is the entrance for pedestrians, and the north end is the exit for pedestrians. All long-distance ferries to Gaoqiao and Wusong, as well as short-distance ferries to Pudong across the river, docked at the new pier starting yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e133">Jicheng Pharmacy Resumed Business Yesterday <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Debts to Be Repaid in Installments Starting June 30th</p>
<p>Actively Pursuing Collection of Debts and Developing Business</p>
<p>Jicheng Pharmacy on Nanjing Road, Shanghai, formerly known as Jicheng Gongji Pharmacy, was forced to temporarily suspend business on the 28th of last month due to the sluggish market, the accumulation of inventory, and the withdrawal of deposits by depositors, which made it impossible to cope with. It is now known that the company, after a shareholders' meeting on the 27th, decided to resume business immediately, as more than three-quarters of the creditors had agreed to and signed the reconciliation plan. It officially resumed business at 9:00 AM yesterday. The details learned by the New News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting Decides to Resume Business　After Jicheng Gongji Pharmacy declared a temporary suspension of business, it held a shareholders' meeting on the 12th of this month and decided on two methods for resuming business. If the consent of more than three-quarters of the creditors was obtained by the 25th of this month, it would resume business immediately; otherwise, it would be liquidated. After the notice of the reconciliation and resumption plan was sent to each creditor, the creditors made some modifications to it. As of the 25th of this month, creditors with a total of over 310,900 yuan had signed their agreement, which accounted for more than three-quarters of the total debt of over 414,000 yuan. Therefore, the company held a shareholders' meeting at its original location on Nanjing Road on the afternoon of the 27th and decided (1) that the company should resume business immediately, (2) that a shareholders' meeting should be convened at 2:00 PM on February 17th, (3) that it should immediately apply to the court for record-keeping, and (4) that it should notify the lawyers and accountants to finalize the reconciliation case. Therefore, it officially started business at 9:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Collecting Debts and Reorganizing Business　The New News Agency reporter visited the company yesterday morning and was received by Mr. Shen, who said that the company was fortunate to have the understanding and mutual benefit of all the creditors, who signed their agreement to the company's reconciliation plan, which enabled it to resume business today. However, after the suspension of business, there was a lot of internal backlog that needed to be reorganized. In addition, the Lunar New Year was approaching, and if the debts were not collected quickly, there would be no time to do so. The company has a total of over 160,000 yuan in outstanding debts, which need to be actively collected to serve as working capital. As for the purchase of goods, the industry is very concerned about the company and is willing to maintain it. Therefore, after the resumption of business, there are no problems with the future of the business.</p>
<p>Creditor Reconciliation Plan　Reconciliation Plan between Jicheng Gongji Pharmacy Co., Ltd. and Creditors: (1) The debt of Jicheng Gongji Pharmacy Co., Ltd. will be repaid in equal installments over ten years, starting from June 30th of this year. The first repayment will be on June 30th, 1935, and repayments will be made successively every year on June 30th. If the company has a surplus at the end of each year, the company will pay interest at a weekly rate of 4%, and the interest will decrease with the principal. (2) If the company still has a surplus after repaying the principal and interest each year, the company should repay the principal of the debt in advance in equal installments. (3) If the company only repays the principal of the debt within ten years and has no surplus to pay interest, the unpaid interest will only be paid from the company's surplus after the principal has been repaid, but compound interest will not be calculated. (4) After the company resumes business, it shall not withdraw shareholder official profits, bonuses, and transportation expenses from the surplus each year before the principal and interest of the debt have been repaid. (5) If the amount of debt is less than 100 yuan, it is not subject to the above reconciliation plan. The above reconciliation plan should be approved by the shareholders' meeting at the request of the board of directors. (6) The creditors agree to the above reconciliation plan and hereby sign and affix their seals below. (Omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e134">Yong'an Silver Company Sued Again by Creditors <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Company Seeks Second Resumption of Business</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Denies Being a Director</p>
<p>Yong'an Silver Company on North Sichuan Road, which opened in September of last year, only operated for three months before suddenly suspending business in December. Later, General Manager Ou Jiancheng left Shanghai to find a solution and hired Sun Zufu as the new manager, and the company recently began to resume business. However, within a few days, it was stranded again. Because the company did not have a concrete plan for the deposits of general depositors, Wang Weiguan, manager of Delong Tobacco Company, sued the company's chairman, Deng Jinghuan, and others for fraud for failing to pay the deposits of 50,000 yuan. The First Special Court has held several hearings, but has not yet concluded the case. Now, depositors Gu Zhenji, Zhang Yinji, Guangxinghao, and other 30 creditors, with an estimated 10,000 yuan in fixed-term and current deposits, have elected Peng Zican, Zhu Wenkui, Yao Keming, Zhang Yinji, and other four persons as representatives, and hired lawyer Zhang Qingyue to sue the Yong'an Silver Company's chairman Deng Jinghuan, vice chairman Wang Jiazhen, directors Mo Dehui, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zilian, Ye Hancheng, Lin Qiuhu, Qian Youju, Peng Baohui, Jiang Qi, Gu Chuntao, director and general manager Ou Jiancheng, and manager Dai Kechang, and 13 others for fraud and obtaining property, requesting that they be summoned and interrogated according to law. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Wu Zehan held a hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The summonses for the defendants were all collected by lawyer Jiang Yiping, but none of them appeared in court. Only Ou Jiancheng retained lawyer Li Shirui to appear in court, stating that some of the defendants were in Peiping, and that the summonses for the remaining defendants had just been delivered to lawyer Jiang last night, so they could not be forwarded in time, and requested a postponement. Judge Wu then asked lawyer Li about the internal organization and total capital of Yong'an Silver Company. Lawyer Li replied that the company's total capital was said to be 1 million yuan, and that it was registered in the United States for the convenience of international transactions. The defendants in this case are all directors, and the shareholders have subscribed for shares, with each share being 100 yuan, for a total subscription of more than 500,000 yuan, but only more than 200,000 yuan was actually paid up, and some shareholders have paid up, while others have not. Chairman Deng Jinghuan subscribed for 20,000 yuan in shares, and the company began operations in September. In December, due to the impact of the collapse of Jiande Bank, six 10,000 yuan promissory notes could not be collected, resulting in a temporary financial crisis and a declaration of suspension of business. The total amount owed is about 220,000 yuan, and the amount owed to the company is 180,000 yuan. Of this amount, the 60,000 yuan owed by Jiande Bank is not easy to collect, but the remaining 120,000 yuan can be recovered gradually. After making every effort to find a solution and hiring Sun Zufu as the manager, the company began to resume business. During this period of resumption, the depositors have successively withdrawn 60,000 to 70,000 yuan of deposits, only because Manager Sun allowed a 65,000 yuan advance at the time, but the result was that not a single cent was received. Recently, Sun signed a statement at lawyer Jiang Yiping's office, willing to find a way to pay 40,000 yuan first, but it did not materialize, so the business was suspended again. The situation is critical at the moment, and efforts are being made to find a way to resume business. Therefore, the creditor in the other case, Delong Tobacco Company, has also understood and has already repaid part of the deposit, 17,000 yuan, and the remaining amount will be repaid at 5,000 yuan per month, and a settlement should be reached. Lawyer Zhang, the agent of the plaintiff, stated that he represented 30 creditors, with about 7 households of fixed-term deposits amounting to more than 6,000 yuan, and the remaining 20 households, all current accounts and transactions, amounting to more than 3,000 yuan. In addition to submitting the deposit slips for each debt, he also presented two pieces of evidence: one is a letter from Lin Kanghou denying that he is a director of the company, and the other is a directive from the Social Bureau to all newspapers to stop publishing the company's advertisements because the company suddenly announced its suspension of business and then resumed business, which was obviously inappropriate. Finally, lawyer Li, the agent of the defendant, stated that Lin Kanghou was indeed a director, and that the company was scheduled to resume business, at the latest around the eighth day of the Lunar New Year, so he requested a postponement. Judge Wu then ordered the case to be adjourned to February 13th at 2:00 PM for further hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Rickshaw Pullers Who Picked Up a Diamond Ring and Pawned It for Profit Fined <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Two Pawnbroker Owners Acquitted</p>
<p>Lu Ada and Lu Asan, rickshaw pullers from Chongming, previously picked up a diamond gold ring lost by a Mr. Feng in Fuyu Lane. Because they could not tell if it was real or fake, they took it to Hongxing Pawnshop on North Sichuan Road for appraisal. A strangely dressed man wanted to buy it, but the price could not be agreed upon, so they gave up. A few days later, the man rented a room in a hotel and invited the two Lus to go there. He gave them 900 yuan to buy the diamond ring. Later, the police learned of this and arrested the Lus for concealing the found property, secretly selling it, and profiting from it, which was illegal. Wu Shangshou and Wu Shanglu, the owners of Hongxing Pawnshop, were also suspected of receiving stolen goods and were sued in the same case. After repeated hearings by Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special District Court, the two Wus hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them, and presented accounting books to prove the legality of their business. Judge Ye himself went to the pawnshop and its affiliate, Hong Kong Jewelry Company, for detailed inspection. Yesterday morning, the court announced the judgment in the case. Lu Ada was fined 140 yuan, and Lu Asan was fined 110 yuan. If they were unable to pay, they would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. Wu Shangshou and Wu Shanglu were acquitted. During the appeal period, they were all allowed to remain released on bail.</p>

<p>Valuable Ornaments Pledged</p>
<p>Clerk Suspected of Conspiracy</p>
<p>Zhang Junyi, from Guangdong, independently opened Baoxing Pawnshop at No. 547 Avenue Joffre, French Concession. His younger brother, Zhang Jinxing, served as the accountant, and Zhang Rusheng was hired as the clerk. On the 21st of this month, Zhang Jinxing ordered Zhang Rusheng to pledge valuable ornaments such as diamonds, jewelry, and jade, worth more than 10,000 yuan, which had been pawned daily in the store, to another pawnshop. At the time, Rusheng refused. Jinxing said that the store's cash flow was tight and he had no choice but to pledge them. Rusheng still refused. Jinxing then said, "The store is owned by my brothers, and we have not divided the property. If there is any dispute in the future, I will be responsible for it alone. If you don't believe me, I can issue a written statement," not wanting to embarrass Rusheng. Rusheng then agreed and had Jinxing issue a written statement. He then took the ornaments to Yuchang Pawnshop and pledged them for 5,050 yuan. In front of the Pudong Bank on Sanmao Bridge, Aidoa Road, he handed over the money to Jinxing in full. Jinxing obtained the money and went to China Aviation Company on Five Ma Road to buy an air ticket from Shanghai to Guangdong and escaped to Guangdong by plane. When store owner Zhang Junyi discovered this, it was too late to pursue his brother, and he reported to the French Police that Zhang Rusheng was involved in conspiracy. The police sent detectives to arrest Zhang Rusheng the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Li Changnian interrogated him. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case, saying that the police had not yet investigated the defendant's embezzlement in the course of business, and requested a postponement pending investigation. After questioning the defendant in court, the judge ordered a postponement to February 1st for further hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Mother Wounded by Knife, Son Afraid to Report to Police</p>
<p>Wang Xu, a 38-year-old widow from Hangzhou, lost her husband many years ago. She has a son named Wang Lijin, who is 17 years old. Due to the poverty of her family, the mother and son came to Shanghai to make a living. They rented a kitchen in Taide Lane, No. 10 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, and lived together. At around 4:00 PM on the 26th of this month, two unknown men suddenly broke into her bedroom and, without asking any questions, took out a sharp axe and slashed her head twice before leaving. She fell to the ground in pain and bleeding profusely. Her son was nearby at the time, but dared not make a sound. After the assailant fled, he hired a car to take her to the Southeast Hospital of the Shanghai Military Camp in the South City for treatment. After staying in the hospital for two days, her injuries worsened, and her son transferred her to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported the matter to the French Police as a murder case. The police sent detectives to investigate. As the case occurred in the French Concession, she was transferred to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, Kim Gu-lin, the inspector general of the Special Agency, dispatched his detectives to investigate the cause of the murder and arrest the assailant for interrogation. However, the reason is still under close investigation.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Thirty Days of Detention</p>
<p>Chen Suzhen, a 22-year-old woman from Hangzhou, residing at No. 372 Da Tong Road, works as a female tea server at the New-Shanghai Company rooftop garden playground. On the evening of the 25th of this month, at 7:10 PM, a Suzhou woman named Wen Lu (21 years old), residing at No. 49 Ruiji Lane, East Jiaxing Road, came to the garden to play. Due to a sudden urge, she went to the restroom. After finishing, she took off her fur coat and placed her wristwatch in the coat pocket, hanging it on the door. At that moment, Chen also went to the restroom, exiting before Wen. When Wen finished washing her hands, she discovered that her wristwatch was missing. At the time, only Chen Suzhen was in the restroom, and there was no one else. She searched everywhere for Chen without success. Therefore, on the 26th, she went to the garden again and confronted Chen, then turned her over to the Lao Zha police station for detention. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted her for theft under Article 337 of the Criminal Law, based on Wen Lu's complaint.</p>
<p>Regarding the circumstances of the theft, Chen Suzhen claimed during interrogation that the wristwatch was found on the floor of the restroom and was not stolen. The court questioned her that if it was indeed found, she should have handed it over to the accounting office. Why did she take it home? She replied that she had not been working as a tea server for long and was unaware of the rules. Judge Ye Shengchao, based on the confession, sentenced Chen Suzhen to thirty days of detention in court as a warning.</p>

<p>The Liu Ying Road Second Soup Kitchen, organized by the Zhabei Charity Group, due to the surge in poor people drinking porridge, recently suddenly received a large number of Hubei refugees, about 400 people, totaling about 25,000 people in the entire factory, which was not enough to accommodate them. The bamboo fences and gates around the factory were completely collapsed, making it impossible to maintain order and fearing danger. It was suddenly announced the day before yesterday that the soup kitchen would be closed for the second time. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The reporter of the Hua Dong News Agency yesterday specially visited Mr. Wang Binyan, the director of the group, to inquire about the follow-up measures.

<p>Allocates Two Million Yuan for Pledged Agricultural Products</p>
<p>Establishes a Total of Nine Warehouses in This and Other Cities</p>
<p>The China Land Reclamation Bank has always been committed to supporting industry and commerce. It provides loans and makes every effort to support major domestic industries operated by Chinese people, such as cotton weaving, wool weaving, flour, electrical appliances, glass, and cement. Recently, in order to focus on rural revitalization, Chairman and General Manager Qin Runqing proposed at the meeting of the Standing Committee that the bank should increase the amount of loans with agricultural products as collateral within this year, aiming to reach two million yuan. On the one hand, it will increase the number of warehouses. In addition to the four warehouses already established in Shanghai, two in Tianjin, and one in Ningbo, it has recently established two cotton warehouses in Yangsi District, Pudong, with as many as fourteen warehouses in total. Currently, it has stored more than 20,000 bales of various seeds and cotton clothing, valued at more than one million yuan, which have been pledged to the bank. The lowest interest rate is only six and a half mills per month. At the same time, the bank has also seen that the construction of highways in the inland areas of Zhejiang has been progressing rapidly in recent years, and transportation has become increasingly convenient. It has decided to first select areas in Yin, Ci, and Yao to build rural warehouses and pledge various agricultural products at the lowest possible interest rates. In North China, the bank has undertaken a large amount of export discounting and loaning for products such as fur and cotton, providing unparalleled convenience to producers in terms of interest rates, exchange rates, and handling fees.</p>

One robber monitored their actions, while the other three went to Zhang's bedroom on the front floor to search and rob. They stole three gold rings, one pearl ring, one gold-set gemstone ring, one gold bracelet, one pair each of pearl earrings and jade earrings, one satin fur coat, one flannel coat, and one camel wool coat, and one set of worsted gabardine jacket and pants. After the robbery, the four robbers put on the clothes and escaped with the stolen goods through the front door. Afterwards, Zhang Rongsheng reported the robbery to the Dongjiadu Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Chief Yi sent a patrol officer to investigate and reported the case to the headquarters for record. At the same time, he ordered the detectives stationed at the station to investigate and arrest the fleeing robbers and bring them to justice according to the law.</p>

<p>Tao Jishi, 26, the wife of Tao Chuande, a Haizhou native who worked as a coolie and lived in a straw shed at the northern end of Shixing Road, Zhabei, has always been on good terms with her husband. Recently, her husband fell ill and could not work, so he stayed at home to recuperate. She suddenly became alarmed about the problem of livelihood. Because Tao had only come to Shanghai recently and was unfamiliar with the area, she lacked assistance and was in a desperate situation. They faced each other in ragged clothes. Recently, her temperament changed drastically, and she kept writing in the air all day long, as if she had lost something. Her husband did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, the night before last, she secretly hanged herself. Her husband was shocked when he realized it and tried to rescue her, but it was too late. The matter was discovered by the police station in charge. In addition to ordering the police to investigate the truth, they also ordered the local security officer Huang Hongsheng to go to the hospital to request an autopsy.</p>

<p>Yan Zaofang, a local resident, residing at No. 39 Deyuli, Dongyouheng Road, suddenly received a pair of anonymous threatening letters at around 8:00 PM on the 25th of this month, demanding 120 silver dollars. He was instructed to wrap the money in paper and put it in a trash can at the entrance at 9:00 PM the night before last. If someone came to take it, otherwise his life would be in danger. Yan immediately reported the information to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Xu Zhiqiong and detectives Lu Jinsheng and Lu Shouchang to wrap a hundred-dollar model in paper according to the letter, and added one silver dollar. They put it in the trash can at the appointed time and waited nearby. After a while, Liu Yinsheng, a Chongming native, 28 years old, arrived, opened the lid of the trash can, and took it out. Just as he was about to escape, he was arrested and taken to the police station. Yan identified him as a box maker working in the west wing of the same residence. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Council lawyer Li Zhishan stated the previous situation and requested a postponement for further investigation of another case. Following the report of the Chinese and Western detectives detailing the events, the threatening letter was presented for inspection. The victim, Yan Zaofang, stated that he worked as a Chinese teacher at the Lao Zha police station. Unexpectedly, the defendant was a resident of the same place. When questioned, Liu Yinsheng confessed that the letter was written with a pencil in the nearby Xiaocai Market in an attempt to get lucky. He gave evasive answers and begged for leniency. Judge Xiao Yifen ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>The oil used for guns and artillery in our country amounts to a huge number every year, and all of them are imported, which is very expensive. However, examining its raw materials, they are all exported from our country. The loss of rights and interests between import and export is countless.

Its quality is pure, it does not change in cold or heat, there is no residue, and its viscosity is qualified, which is comparable to foreign goods in every respect. It is even cheaper than foreign goods after lubrication. The application for the inspection certificate has been submitted to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. The head office is located at 80 Hualong Road, Shanghai, telephone 84817. There are two types of oil: one for military and police to clean guns and artillery, which is stored in large barrels, and each barrel is only half the price of foreign goods. The oil for self-defense pistols is stored in glass bottles, each bottle costs five dimes, with exquisite decoration and easy to carry.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our clients, the creditors of China Industrial Bank, including Yu Ji, Nan Ji, Fu Ji, Ji Ji, Cheng Ji, Jin Ying Xian, and others. They have stated that they saw in your newspaper an article about the creditors' meeting of China Industrial Bank, in which the resolutions of the creditors were reported in a manner inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>According to our investigation, on January 26th of this month, a meeting of creditors of China Industrial Bank was held at the Chamber of Commerce. Nine creditor representatives, along with the defendant Lu Xihou and his legal representative Wu Linkun, were present. Lawyer Dong Yu first reported on the proceedings, after which Lu Xihou declared that at most, only 20% of the debt could be repaid after the final accounting. This contradicted his previous statement made during his detention, where he guaranteed the repayment of half of the debt. Moreover, his attitude was strong and his language was vulgar. He even threatened to voluntarily return to court and be detained again to coerce the creditors.</p>
<p>The creditors were extremely indignant at the time and insisted on maintaining the original plan. After the court clerk left, our clients and other creditors successively left the venue to devise a countermeasure in private. However, it was reported that after Lu Xihou left in disguise, the creditors suddenly agreed to Lu's proposed principle of repaying 20% of the debt and instructed Lu to publish a reply in the newspaper within two days. If this is not a fabricated publicity stunt, it is the result of manipulating a small number of creditors or representatives to create this illegal resolution, which is truly outrageous.</p>
<p>In addition to jointly petitioning the court to investigate and handle the matter according to law to protect our rights and interests, the matter concerns the overall interests of all creditors. We request that you, esteemed lawyers, send a letter of correction on behalf of the creditors to address the baseless resolutions reported in the newspaper, to clarify the facts and prevent manipulation by a few individuals.</p>
<p>We hereby inform you of the situation and respectfully request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section of your newspaper as a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<h3 id="e163">Yesterday's Expanded Memorial Week City Mayor Wu's Report <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Policy Directions for Shanghai Municipal Facilities in the Republic Year of 24</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, today is a most somber memorial day for Shanghai. Three years have passed since the January 28th Shanghai Incident. In these three years, thanks to the cooperation of local figures and the joint efforts of colleagues in the municipal government, the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Zhenru, Dachang, and Miaohang have successively returned to their former appearance. Although Zhabei has not fully recovered, local figures and colleagues in the municipal government are currently working together to promote its restoration, which is expected in the near future. This is something to be gratified about.</p>
<p>However, in addition to our joy, we should also deeply investigate the reasons why we suffered such a catastrophe from the painful lessons left to us by this war. Of course, this is because our country's strength is insufficient. Therefore, the central government has declared to the whole country that we must enrich national strength and that local governments and people must work together to build up national strength. However, building national strength is a heavy responsibility with a long way to go. Other countries have achieved their current wealth and strength through a hundred and several decades of continuous effort. Our China is only beginning to build the country and enrich national strength today. If we still follow the construction procedures of other countries and do things step by step, it will take a hundred and several decades to achieve the same wealth and strength as other countries today. And by the time a hundred and several decades have passed, other countries will naturally have made even more progress than us. As a result, we will still be lagging behind. It can be seen that this kind of circuitous road is impassable. Because in today's international situation, we cannot afford to proceed slowly.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Premier told us to "catch up head-on." If our central and local governments and the 450 million compatriots across the country can unite and follow the Premier's last will to "catch up head-on" to build our country and enrich national strength, then perhaps in ten or eight years, our country will have a turning point.</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, we are all serving the city of Shanghai. Speaking of the city, today I will take Shanghai as an example. Let us make a comparative observation of the construction of the Shanghai concessions and the construction of the Shanghai urban area. The construction of the Shanghai concessions has a history of eighty or ninety years. The achievements shown by the orderly and relatively planned construction of the concessions over this long period of eighty or ninety years are only this. However, if we stick to conventions and follow their circuitous path, even to achieve the same construction as the concessions, I am afraid it will take us eighty or ninety years of effort, which would be too uneconomical. Therefore, we must now build our city in accordance with the Premier's last will and catch up head-on in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Shanghai is the largest city in China with a population of 3.45 million. To build Shanghai, we must first deeply understand what Shanghai lacks, what people did not pay attention to in the past, and strive to remedy it.</p>
<p>The Shanghai municipal construction of the past three years has several reportable characteristics. In the first year, we encountered the January 28th Incident, and most of our work was limited to responding to the war, handling post-war reconstruction in the war zone, and stabilizing social order. In the second year, we worked hard on the reconstruction of the war zone and continued to work hard on the active construction of the downtown area and the completion of the Shanghai Municipal Government Building. The third year, which was last year, we worked hard on cultural construction, such as libraries, museums, sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, municipal hospitals, and other constructions that started one after another. Although some people criticized us, saying that this kind of construction could be postponed, or thought that it should be built in Nanshi or Zhabei, both of these criticisms have one-sided reasons. But taking the entire Shanghai as a whole, Shanghai is the largest city in China, a metropolis with a population of 3.45 million, and the above-mentioned constructions should exist. Not only should they exist, but they should have existed long ago. Let us take major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, and Nanjing as examples. Beijing today has only 1.12 million people, Guangzhou has only about one million people, Qingdao has only 500,000 people, Tianjin also has only 400,000 to 500,000 people, and Nanjing has only 700,000 people. However, all of the above-mentioned cities already have large libraries and large-scale sports fields. Shanghai, which calls itself the largest city in China, only has two libraries to this day, and both are very small, one in the concession and one in the Wenmiao in Nanshi. There is also only a small sports field in Nanshi. Speaking of hospitals, Shanghai, a metropolis with a population of 3.45 million, does not even have a municipal hospital. According to statistics, there are less than 2,000 hospital beds in the entire city of Shanghai. If we follow the public health facilities of foreign countries, it seems that there should be one hospital bed for every twenty people. Then how are these 2,000 hospital beds enough for Shanghai's population of 3.45 million? Based on this, libraries, museums, sports fields, gymnasiums, municipal hospitals, etc. are the most needed facilities in Shanghai at present. As for the reason why they should be built in the downtown area, it is naturally determined by the overall municipal construction plan. Any far-sighted municipal builder will be able to understand and agree. Moreover, the investment in the construction of the downtown area by the public and private sectors has reached 20 to 30 million yuan, which shows that the prosperity of the downtown area is not only a natural trend, but also a recent possible fact. This is a summary of the construction of this city in the past three years.</p>
<p>This year is the Republic Year of 24. What should we, the city government and I, strive for in the future? Regarding this point, I already have a message to the citizens on New Year's Day this year, which has been published in various newspapers. I believe that all comrades have seen it. Generally speaking, our construction this year has an important characteristic, which is social construction that is generally neglected by people but is related to the welfare of the majority of the people. China's current objective phenomenon is that everything is waiting to be done. However, we cannot do everything at once. We can only do what we can do. We will set a policy every year and carry out several construction projects step by step. Therefore, the policy direction for municipal facilities last year was cultural construction, while this year focuses on social construction. The construction of social undertakings in this city, including educational construction, can be divided into six aspects, which are now reported separately and briefly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Building New Villages for the Common People: There are 150,000 to 200,000 compatriots in Shanghai who live in thatched sheds that are like hell. These compatriots in the slums are easy to be born and easy to die. The mortality rate is relatively high. Those who do not die often have diseases and live an inhuman life. We cannot bear to sit idly by and watch them drift along like this. We must rescue them from hell. Not only must we rescue them from hell, but we must also find ways to improve their lives so that they can also live a human life. First, we should first solve their housing problem. Therefore, the first task of the Shanghai Municipal Government this year is to build new villages for the common people to solve their housing problem. According to a rough estimate, there are about 30,000 thatched sheds in the entire city of Shanghai. Our current plan is to first build 10% of them, a total of 3,000 houses for the common people, with 500 houses as a new village. Each new village will have a school, which will also be a place for the common people to gather. Each new village will also have a simple clinic, a small-scale nursery, and a space for poor children to play. In addition, each new village will also have a public bathroom, which is separated for men and women, and a public place to wash clothes. All of these facilities are indispensable for their daily life. In this way, on the one hand, their housing problem is solved, and at the same time, their lives can be improved. Moreover, with the improvement of the lives of the common people, the resulting effects, hygiene, can also be further guaranteed. Because the source of diseases that are harmful to public health in the city is mostly in the slums. Therefore, if these slums are improved, the public health of our entire city and the health of the general public can be safely guaranteed. Therefore, building new villages for the common people is the most important social construction project of the Shanghai Municipal Government this year. This is what our colleagues should work together to achieve. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Eighth Episode: Remote Places, Light Officials, Far-Off, Strong-Willed Magistrate; Grand Hall, Lavish Banquet, Outside, Pitiful Insects</p>
<p>Let them force Bai, layer upon layer, pressing layer upon layer, hitting layer upon layer, hitting until the money is taken out to settle the matter. Zhang Jie went and said: This method is very poisonous, not afraid of not finding money. Zhou Yourong said: This was not invented now. A few years ago, weren't there troops shouting slogans, "Don't disturb the people, truly love the people?" That was the method they came up with. They don't disturb the people; they let the county magistrate bear this great crime. They have left the Northwest, but this good method is still being used. Cheng Zhiqian smiled: County Magistrate Zhou is just so frank; he says everything. Zhou Yourong said: Xi'an is a place where there is national law. Why can't I say it? Also, they forced me, but I was unwilling to do it. Even if I did, I couldn't hand over two thousand silver in three days. Might as well die and compensate the people for a while. At that time, I said to my company commander, "Raising money is now the responsibility of the finance commissioner. You should ask him, don't ask me. If you are afraid of failing to complete the task, please ask your commander to come. The finance commissioner is also here. The three of us will talk face to face." That company commander had probably never encountered such a tough county magistrate since he started handling affairs. He immediately became enraged and raised his fist to hit me. Once he made a move, the brothers he brought along, why be polite, swarmed up and hit me without mercy, until I didn't even have the strength to cry "ouch." It was still a section chief by my side who shouted loudly, "You can't hit him! How will you explain to the province if you kill the county magistrate?" Perhaps they were trained. Hitting the county magistrate could only injure him, not kill him. Only after hearing these words did they spare me. From then on, I slept in bed for two weeks. While I was recuperating in bed, I thought to myself, "With a five-foot body, where can't I find a bowl of rice to eat? Why suffer such torture?" After another half month, I asked for leave to go to the province. Before leaving, I was still worried that they would detain me. (124)</p>
<h3 id="e165">Red Sheep Trivial Talks <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Red Sheep story has already been performed on stage, and now Xinhua Film Company is filming a sound movie to promote the national spirit, which is a very good intention. I will now describe what I know about the trivial matters of the Taiping Army to provide some help for discussion.</p>
<p>The clothing and colors of the Taiping Army are a matter of contention among those who study stage plays. Most people generally believe that they wore red turbans and red clothes. Some say that the turbans and uniforms of the Taiping Army were all yellow. Forty years ago, the *Iron Rooster* performed also had yellow turbans, but later the authenticity was gradually lost. However, according to the *Abridged Record of the Pacification of the Guangdong Bandits*, "The bandits favored yellow in their clothing. The pseudo-kings all wore yellow robes, embroidered with dragons, and their crowns were also like this. Those below the pseudo-marquises also wore yellow robes, while those below the pseudo-commanders wore red robes. Their jackets and short-sleeved back clothing were embroidered with dragons and phoenixes, done arbitrarily without a fixed system. Both men and women wrapped their heads with long scarves, with the ends dragging to their hips. Pseudo-division commanders and above used yellow, while those below used red. Whether silk or cloth, it was all up to them. Many were red inside, so the people of Jianghuai called the bandits 'Red Heads,' and their hoods were also red." From this, it can be seen that yellow was the clothing of the upper ranks, and red was the clothing of the lower ranks, and the contentions can be resolved.</p>
<p>After Hong Xiuquan established his capital in Jiangning, he summoned the English craftsman Ross and the Hong Kong worker Zhou Bin to supervise the manufacture of six types of gold and silver coins to trade with Western countries. The large gold coin was 5 pounds, the medium gold coin was 2 pounds, and the small gold coin was 1 pound. Each pound was made into ten large silver coins, the large silver coin was 100 cents, the medium silver coin was 50 cents, and the small silver coin was 20 cents. The weight and size were all modeled after the Hong Kong gold and silver coins. However, although the gold and silver coins were made, they could not be circulated. Because Western countries regarded the Heavenly Kingdom as an unofficial state, they uniformly refused to use them, and Hong Tianwang destroyed them all in anger. Those who secretly kept them regarded them as treasures. Someone who saw them said that the front of the coin was inscribed with "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and the back was horizontally inscribed with "Jin Bin" in seal script. Also, the Taiping copper coins had "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" inscribed on the front and "Sheng Bin" in regular script on the back, either arranged vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>The names of the figures in the Taiping Army were often changed to avoid taboos. After being used for a long time, the original names were forgotten, so I have recorded them below: Li Xiucheng's original name was Yiwen, and the Heavenly King changed his name to Xiucheng. Yang Xiuqing's original name was Sizaijing. Wei Changhui's original name was Zheng. Chen Yucheng's original name was Picheng, and the Heavenly King praised his achievements and changed his name to Yucheng. Zeng Tianyang's original name was Tianyang, but to avoid the Heavenly King's name, he changed Tian to Tian. Huang Zaixing's original name was Tianshen, also to avoid the character Tian, so he changed his name to Zaixing. Zeng Fengchuan's original name was Jin. Huang Yiyun's original name was Yiyun, but to avoid the taboo of Nanfeng, he changed his name to Yiyun. Chen Qishi's original name was Qishi. Li Junliang's original name was Junchang, but to avoid the taboo of Beiwei, he changed his name to Junliang. Lu Xianba's original name was Xianda, but to avoid the taboo of Shi Dakai, he changed his name to Xianba. Li Laifang's original name was Kaifang, but to avoid the taboo of Yi Shi, his name was changed to Laifang in all documents and reports. Li Laisheng's original name was Kaisheng, and he also changed his name to avoid the taboo of Yi Shi.</p>

<p>—(Chen Yunsu)</p>
<p>There's a saying: "No cat doesn't eat fish, no official doesn't want gold." I think the saying that no cat doesn't eat fish is quite believable, but as for the saying that no official doesn't want gold, I absolutely deny it. Why? Because isn't every official swearing to be honest and content with simplicity when they take office? How can they overthrow themselves and slap themselves in the face?</p>
<h3 id="e167">Returning from Listening to Storytelling in the Countryside <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>—Xunzi</p>
<p>Storytelling is a local art of Suzhou with mass appeal. The three prefectures of Hangjiahu along the Huhang Railway, as well as Changzhou and below along the Huning Railway, and many towns in the Taihu Lake basin, are all areas where the famous artists of Guangyu Society are active.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, radio has become popular, and several leading figures and top performers of Guangyu Society have abandoned the storytelling stage and switched to broadcasting stations. However, only the propertied and leisured classes can afford to buy radios. As for the small teahouses in thatched huts in the countryside, where many mud-legged villagers gather, quietly waiting for the storyteller to take the stage, a piece of sounding wood and a stringed instrument are gifts to comfort the toiling masses. Storytelling there is a true mass art. Although the storyteller's remuneration is meager, its value far exceeds that of the so-called famous storytellers who only serve the leisured ladies and gentlemen at broadcasting stations. However, it is said that those who have not become famous, or who have recently graduated, are willing to go to small wharves to sing and tell stories. As for those who have become famous, they swear that they will never run the wharves again.</p>
<p>This time, I had the opportunity to listen to a storytelling performance on a small wharf along the Luhuning Railway. The ballad was "Jade Dragonfly," and the story was "Tales of the Martyrs." The storyteller was certainly not among the famous artists, and besides, whether it was a long story or a short story, it was full of feudal colors. "Jade Dragonfly" and "Tales of the Martyrs" naturally could not escape the shackles of the era. However, the description of the nuns of the Fahua Nunnery, breaking through the barriers of etiquette and achieving sexual satisfaction, how bold was that in the beginning? The second half tells the story of Jin Zhang's usurpation, saying that Jin Zhang was known as the tigress of Suzhou.</p>
<p>This, in the originally male-centered society, was nothing less than a bold act of giving women a voice. Therefore, I believe that if "Jade Dragonfly" is re-evaluated, it is indeed much higher than the "Fallen Golden Fan," which does not escape the clichés of the talented scholar and beautiful lady, and the feudal remnants of the "Pearl Pagoda" and so on. In Shanghai, Zhang Yunting, who tells "Jade Dragonfly," seems to be blown down by the wind when he steps down from the stage. However, when he is on the stage, he is energetic. He is a typical figure of an artist. I like listening to his stories the most!</p>
<p>"Tales of the Martyrs" is just a narration of the history of the Ming Taizu's founding of the country. This kind of autocratic tyrant who uses killing as power has no value to worship! However, just discussing the story, Jiang Yifei can tell the story clearly. Compared to interspersing one or two current events, which is considered "yin xue," in my personal opinion, he is better than the former!</p>

<p>▲Mrs. Meng, a German woman (Mrs. Mentana Su) advocated for the Saar vote. She flew back from Shanghai, a journey of 24,000 miles (8,000 English miles). The Saar was returned to Germany. The Germans rejoiced. Although one vote is extremely small, the national spirit is higher than the mountains. The Saar is rich in coal and iron. German craftsmanship is the best in the world. After fifteen years of division, it is now returned. Patriots should protect their borders like this.</p>

<p>Finally, someone told Li Lianying about my actions in the Imperial Ancestral Temple. This person certainly wouldn't let the matter rest! He secretly told the Empress Dowager: "This fire started very strangely! It is said that when the Emperor was performing the sacrifice, he actually imitated the foreign soldiers and gave a hand salute. No wonder the ancestors were angered!" Thus, she became furious after dawn and severely scolded me, as if the fire in the Imperial Ancestral Temple was all my fault. Don't you think this is a joke?"</p>
<p>I had never heard of this matter before, but I didn't feel like making any comment. I could only use a smile as a way out.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's temper was really very strange! No matter what she did, she always couldn't avoid regretting it. Although she had listened to the words of the two officials of the Imperial Observatory and decided to cancel the plan to continue heading east, she was extremely eager for the scenery of the Changbai Mountains and deeply regretted not doing the calculation. She suspected that their calculations might not be accurate, and maybe tomorrow would be the most auspicious day. Wouldn't she have missed it in vain? However, how could she risk such a great danger (?)? Because she dared not risk getting involved, but could not forget the original plan, she felt an indescribable annoyance herself. Because of her annoyance, the people of the entire palace were affected, making us all feel extremely bored and uneasy. The entire ancient palace of Shengjing was shrouded in an atmosphere of melancholy. I think we won't be able to see happy scenes again before we return to Beijing! (234)</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Development of Shanghai Hospitals (Part 1) <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>The history of hospitals in Shanghai can be divided into two periods: The first is the period of establishment by foreigners, which includes two phases: "Establishment by Churches" and "Establishment by Foreign Public and Concession Authorities." The second period is the period of self-establishment by Chinese, which also has two phases: the first is "Publicly Run," and the second is "Municipally Run."</p>
<p>After Shanghai opened as a port, Christian and Catholic missionaries, with the permission of treaties, flocked here to make it a center for missionary work; at the same time, they began their medical endeavors, which were very helpful in assisting their missionary activities. In another sense, it brought a new public health system and methods to this place. This kind of social welfare work carried out by the churches has become a glorious record in history and is not easily forgotten by the people. The names often on their lips are:</p>
<p>Renji Hospital 1843 Established by the London Missionary Society</p>
<p>Lester Chinese Hospital later Shandong</p>
<p>Road Hospital</p>
<p>Tongren Hospital 1867 Established by the American Episcopal Church</p>
<p>St. Luke's Hospital</p>
<p>Women and Children's Hospital 1885 Established by the Women's Missionary Society</p>
<p>Margaret Williamson Hospital</p>
<p>Guangren Hospital 1903 Established by the American Episcopal Church</p>
<p>St. Elizabeth Hospital</p>
<p>Guangci Hospital 1904 Established by the Catholic Church</p>
<p>Hospital St. Marie</p>
<p>Renji Hospital was the first hospital in Shanghai, founded by Dr. Wm. Lockhar, a priest of the London Missionary Society. He came to Shanghai in 1843 and began his preaching work in the city. At that time, Shanghai had just been declared open as a commercial port, and the residential area for foreigners had not yet been delineated. His hospital was initially located in the South Gate and moved to the outer city of the North Gate in 1846. In 1844, he bought 24 acres of land south of present-day Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road for 45 yuan per mu as the center of the London Missionary Society. The land price there has now risen to 35,000 taels of silver per mu. In 1861, Renji Hospital began selling real estate outside the North Gate and built a hospital on Shandong Road. This hospital did many things, so that most people in Shanghai knew what was called "Ma Jia Quan" - this is the local name for the London Missionary Society. How did the London Missionary Society get called Ma Jia Quan? The reason is that the first Protestant missionary to come to China was Dr. Morrison. The locals pronounced the sound of the word "Mo" as the character "Mai." They saw that the area of Renji Hospital had become a gathering place for missionaries, so they called it Ma Jia Quan. (Note) The management rights of this hospital were later transferred to the committee of local social organizations, while the London Missionary Society provided doctors, nurses, and staff, and retained missionary work. It has become a public and religious hospital.</p>
<p>Not long ago, it received a grant of two million taels from the Lester legacy fund and was rebuilt into the most modern hospital. The English name of the hospital was also changed from "Shandong Road Hospital" to "Lester Chinese Hospital" in memory.</p>
<p>The establishment of Tongren Hospital is also an exciting story. Initially, there was an American woman living in Shanghai, Mrs. E. Shields, who suffered from a severe eye disease. She sought treatment from a Christian doctor and recovered. The doctor refused payment, so Mrs. Xi donated 100 US dollars and instructed Thomson, a clergyman of the Episcopal Church, to use it to help the poor. Tang consulted with Wu Hongyu, a Chinese clergyman, about the use of the money. Wu said, "There are too many poor people in Shanghai. It is impossible to save them all with a hundred dollars. If we use these hundred dollars for medical expenses to save the poor and sick, wouldn't that be better?" Tang clapped his hands in praise. Therefore, they rented a house for six yuan a month as a pharmacy. For a time, foreign doctors in the area came to the pharmacy to provide diagnosis and treatment. Wu Hongyu, in his spare time from preaching, raised funds for the hospital, so that this small-scale pharmacy would not be abandoned halfway, and there would be surplus funds to accumulate. Coincidentally, someone wanted to sell thirteen old houses in the Hongkou area. Wu and Tang bought it and combined it into eleven bays, and the signboard of "Tongren Hospital" was inscribed at this time, several years after the initial creation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop participated in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War work and was falsely accused of being spies by the enemy. The members Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Mao Zhengxiang, and Bao Zhengwu were brutally killed. At that time, because the enemy was afraid of being sanctioned by world justice, they destroyed the corpses. In order to commemorate the four martyrs, the troop built a memorial tomb in the Shanghai Cemetery in Jiangwan, which will be completed soon. In addition to building a memorial tower for the four martyrs in front of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Auditorium at Tianhougong Bridge, the troop will convene all normal and reserve members of the three armies every year on the anniversary of the martyrdom of the four martyrs to hold a memorial meeting. This month, the 31st is the third anniversary of the martyrdom of the four martyrs. The troop has ordered all faculty and staff members and the families of the four martyrs to gather at the headquarters to hold a three-week memorial ceremony, lower the flag to half-mast, and suspend training for one day. Lianhua Film Company will also bring two films of the memorial service for the four martyrs and the two-week memorial service for screening.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Zhejiang Education Director Xu Talks About the Issue of Changing the Education Bureau to a Section <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>After Huang Shaoxiong took office as the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, he was determined to reform county administration. There was a saying that he would raise the authority of the county magistrate based on the Lanchi Experimental County method, save county administrative expenses, and merge various bureaus under the county into sections. The County Education Bureau is also among those to be merged. Xu Shaodi, the director of the Education Department, said to people yesterday that all administration must be unified in authority and clearly defined in responsibilities, which is what I have always advocated. I strongly agree that county administration should adopt a centralized system. However, regarding the matter of changing the Education Bureau to a section, in the current situation, advantages and disadvantages are seen. In the future, whether to conduct experiments in a small number of counties first and then decide on a unified method is still under study. It is noted that the Education Bureaus of various counties are roughly equivalent to the persuasion offices of the Qing Dynasty. After the revolution, they were either established or abolished. During the Republic of China, a special section was set up in the county office to manage education. By the fourth year of the Republic of China, due to the complexity of local education and the inability to focus on responsibilities, it was difficult to promote, so the persuasion offices were restored. It was not until the eleventh year of the Republic of China that the persuasion offices were changed to education bureaus. Recently, after a part of Jiangsu Province changed its methods, Shandong also decided to change the bureau to a section at the provincial education administration meeting. As for the bandit suppression provinces, because the provincial government adopted a joint office system, the counties also followed the camp order to uniformly change the bureau to a section. If this proposition is also realized in our province, then the county office will set up a section to manage the educational administrative affairs of the entire county, which will be similar to the political system of the early Republic of China. Currently, there are roughly two reasons for advocating changing the bureau to a section: one is to save expenses, and the other is to increase the authority of the county magistrate. Changing the bureau to a section can reduce educational administrative expenses, and this kind of savings can be used to subsidize local educational undertakings. However, in terms of the province, we must pay attention to the fact that after the section is changed, the expenses will not only not be reduced, but must be increased quite a bit. It is found that the administrative expenses of the Education Bureau of the entire county are estimated to be more than 380,000 yuan, of which more than 80,000 yuan are subsidized by the province, and the remaining 290,000 yuan are local education funds. It is also found that the treatment of personnel in the Education Bureau is very different from that of personnel in the county government. The treatment of personnel in the education sector is meager, and the salary of the director of the bureau is equal to that of a section member or clerk in the county government. After the bureau is changed, the treatment of the section chief and school supervisor will naturally be the same as that of other section chiefs and section members. Therefore, although the number of personnel is reduced, the salary will increase instead, and the provincial subsidy will inevitably increase. Therefore, the frugality of expenses is a one-sided view. As for the improvement of the authority of the county magistrate, special attention should be paid, that is, if education is handled by a section, the selection of county magistrate candidates should be strictly screened. Recent inspections and reports show that many county magistrates pay attention to the development of education, but there are also many who despise it and do not take education seriously at all. There are countless examples. It is no different than trying to catch fish by climbing a tree to expect these people to be able to promote local educational undertakings. Therefore, to realize the plan to change the bureau to a section, the selection of county magistrate candidates must be screened first.</p>

<p>▲Intended to be displayed in the university's Freely Industrial Museum</p>
<p>▲The Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered the Chicago Expo Products Association to donate appropriately</p>
<p>According to a letter from Yale and Harvard Universities in the United States to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the university plans to establish a "Freely Science and Industry Museum" and requests our country to donate famous products for display. In order to promote friendly relations and promote domestic products, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially ordered the Chicago Expo Products Association in my country to inform its representative in the United States to select relevant cultural domestic products from the products participating in the Chicago Expo and donate them to the university for display. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Instruction No. Shang Zi 31658 to the association is recorded as follows: It is found that Yale and Harvard Universities in the United States previously sent a letter stating that the university intends to establish a "Freely Science and Industry Museum" to commemorate peace and requested donations of Chinese products for display in the museum's "Chinese Department." It was instructed to investigate when the university's "Science and Industry Museum" and the Chinese Department were established, as well as the plans and scale of the Chinese Department, and whether it was necessary for our country to donate products. If feasible, please instruct the Consul General in Chicago to consult with the Products Association participating in the Chicago Expo and select our country's special products to donate to the university. After the Ministry replied, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Guo Zi No. 169 official letter stated, "According to the report from the Embassy in the United States, 'The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Shang Zi No. 27948 official letter to the Embassy stated that Yale and Harvard Universities in the United States intend to establish a "Freely Science and Industry Museum" to commemorate peace and requested Chinese products to be displayed in the museum's Chinese Department, and requested an investigation into when the museum was established and the plans and scale of the Chinese Department, and whether it was necessary for our country to donate products. If feasible, please instruct the Consul General in Chicago to consult with the Products Association participating in the Chicago Expo and select our country's special products to donate to the university.' The Embassy separately inquired about the details from the US Department of Education and the president of the university. The US Department of Education replied through the US Department of State, and the president of the university also replied, stating that three or four years ago, a graduate of the university, Mr. W. Earl Hoppe, proposed setting up a peace memorial hall at the university. Since then, many precious items have been collected, including woven national flags from various countries and autographed photos and books. They are currently stored in the library of the museum and hope to build a special hall for display in the future." The initiator, Mr. Hopper, previously sent a letter to the Embassy requesting a donation and sent a woven portrait of the Prime Minister. Recently, according to a report from the Deputy Consul in New York, the university sent a letter requesting several kinds of flowering trees from China to be planted in the "Chinese Department" of the memorial hall. Please forward it to the Chinese government. It is noted that the memorial hall mentioned by the university has not yet been established. Whether our country should donate special products and flowering trees should be determined by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and instructed to the Products Association participating in the Chicago Expo to comply. In addition to replying to the Deputy Consul in New York, I have copied the four pieces of correspondence back and forth and included a copy of the articles of association leaflet for your review." It is appropriate to include the original attachments and request a review. It is hoped that a reply will be received. It is found that the university's "Science and Industry Museum" is established to commemorate peace and promote culture. Donations should be made appropriately to promote friendly relations and promote domestic products. In accordance with the previous letter, in addition to replying, you should immediately inform the association's representative in the United States to select relevant cultural domestic products from the products participating in the Chicago Expo and donate them for display, and provide a report. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Ministry of Education Promotes Simplified Characters, Li and Wang Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday to Investigate Copper Molds <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲Li talked in detail about casting phonetic copper molds and simplified characters</p>
<p>▲The Chinese Stenography Society is scheduled to invite Wang to give a lecture on stenography</p>
<p>In order to make compulsory education and public education easier to promote, the Ministry of Education has specially decided to compile a simplified character spectrum and cast copper molds for phonetic Chinese characters, and sent Li Jinxi and Wang Yi of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee to Shanghai to investigate copper molds. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specially visited them yesterday. According to the talk, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of the work of the National Language Council Li first talked about the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, which was established in the eighth year of the Republic of China and reorganized once in the seventeenth year. Thirty-one commissioners were publicly hired, with Wu Zhihui as the chairman of the commission, and Qian Xuantong, Lu Maozhi, Li Jinxi and other seven people as standing commissioners. The main work over the years is divided into: ㈠ Unification, such as agreeing on the standard of national language and national language, and adopting standard vocabulary and grammar. ㈡ Legislation, such as agreeing on phonetic symbols and various symbols related to national language literature. ㈡ Review, such as reviewing books on national language and national pronunciation, and inspecting and correcting the teaching of national language and national pronunciation. ㈣ Documents, such as historical investigation, collection, collation, statistics, and commendation. As for the planned activities, they are described in detail in the Outline of the History of the National Language Movement, which was recently published by Commercial Press. The Chinese Dictionary and the National Language Romanization are roughly larger-scale works.</p>
<p>Casting phonetic Chinese copper molds Next, the National Language Unification Association decided to set up a National Language Printing House at the seventh regular meeting in January this year. The purpose is to cast the entire lead-character copper mold with phonetic symbols next to Chinese characters, and it was decided that this copper mold should be cast and promoted by the state. Therefore, the meeting submitted a case to the ministry to allocate funds for casting. Wang Shijie, the Minister of Education, sent a letter to Li Jinxi and Wang Yi on January 15, inviting various members of the meeting to discuss the actual plan in detail and bring it to Beijing for discussion. The colleagues arrived in Beijing on the 23rd and held a meeting at the Ministry of Education on the 26th. It was decided to send the colleagues to Shanghai first to investigate the copper mold. It will take about a week to complete. In the future, the Ministry of Education may issue an order that popular reading materials, elementary school textbooks, and newspaper columns should all be printed with this lead type.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education compiles a simplified character spectrum Since the National Language Unification Association passed the reduction of the strokes of existing Chinese characters in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, it organized the Chinese Character Simplified Committee and elected Qian Xuantong, Hu Shi, Li Jinxi and other fifteen people as commissioners. At that time, due to the unsettled situation, it was unable to proceed. Last year, it passed the collection of inherent and more applicable simplified characters and decided to compile a simplified character spectrum. Later, Chen Guangyao, a member of the Xijing Preparatory Committee, requested Chairman Jiang to promote simplified characters. The Ministry of Education issued an order to the National Language Council to quickly review and report it, and to propose detailed opinions on promoting simplified characters to assist public education for verification. After the National Language Council reviewed and reported it to the ministry, the ministry invited colleagues to Beijing to discuss it together with the previous case. As a result, it was decided to first complete the practical simplified character spectrum, which was the responsibility of seven commissioners, and then the ministry would officially announce it or order public education reading materials and textbooks to be used uniformly.</p>
<p>The situation of promoting national language shorthand Wang Yi, the inventor of Chinese National Language Shorthand, said, "Thirty years ago, I realized that Chinese pronunciation can be performed in a simple way in the "Old Empty Valley Method", but at that time, the pronunciation was mostly based on the southern dialect, so it was not widely used. After arriving in the north, I studied the national language and compiled and printed the Chinese New Stenography Technique in the eighth year of the Republic of China. I have revised it several times based on my teaching experience at the Beijing Stenography Training Institute. I have ordered a one-character, one-line Wang Yi Stenography, and the National Language Unification Association of the Ministry of Education has opened a National Language Stenography Training Institute in Beijing, Nanjing and other places, for a total of fifteen sessions. Although I am here to investigate copper molds, I intend to take this opportunity to contact teaching classes in Shanghai. Learning shorthand is not difficult, it just requires persistence."</p>

<h3 id="e179">Hu Shi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲Sun Ke hosted a banquet at noon and will return to Beijing</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shi, a professor at Beijing University, went south to Hong Kong and Guilin to give lectures. He returned north on the President Hoover yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 a.m. At about 9:00 a.m., he took a small steamship across the river to the Xin Guan Wharf and disembarked. Li Zhaohuan, the president of Jiaotong University, and others welcomed him. After Hu landed, he returned to his residence to rest. At noon, he attended a luncheon hosted by Sun Zhesheng, the president of the Legislative Yuan. According to Hu, the construction situation in the southwest is quite good, but because I traveled back and forth to Hong Kong and Guilin by plane, I was unable to see everything. I will stay in Shanghai for one or two days and then return to Beijing.</p>
<p>Also, Hu is staying at the New Asia Hotel. According to Hu, the impression of this trip is very good, especially the trip from Guangzhou to Yongning, which was by plane. Looking down from above and seeing the mountains and rivers of South China, I was even more satisfied. Moreover, the distance from Guangzhou to Yongning is about five thousand miles, and the flight is only half a day. I am very impressed with the speed of the plane. As for the misunderstanding of the speech in Guangzhou, I (Hu Shi called himself) do not mind at all. I stayed in Guangzhou for two and a half days, and those I interacted with were mostly political educators, and they did not mention this matter. Because what I said was only criticism of reading the classics in elementary schools, and did not involve other issues, but I did not expect the rumors to spread so widely.</p>

<p>▲The Municipal Education Bureau ordered the Lake Society, etc. to comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed the Lake Society, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, the Central Auditorium, and various theaters, cinemas, and public and private secondary schools and above in the city, stating that all operas performed in the city should comply with the provisions of Article 3 of the bureau's regulations on the review of opera records. An application form should be prepared in advance, and two copies of the opera content, explanation or script, and actor name list should be submitted to the bureau for review. Only after approval can rehearsals be held. It is now found that various drama groups in the city borrow schools or cinemas and other public places to perform dramas, often without complying with the legal procedures, which is inappropriate. It is hereby ordered that the theaters and schools should absolutely not allow drama groups to borrow venues if their scripts have not been reviewed and approved by the bureau.</p>

<p>▲Scheduled to start school on March 1</p>
<p>▲Huang Zhaoxiong will serve as the principal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association has spared no effort in promoting social education in the city for the past two years. It has run as many as 22 civil schools. The association believes that there are many illiterate people in the local area. Running civil schools can achieve great results with very little funding. Therefore, the board of directors decided to continue running the original First Civil School, and it will start enrolling students on March 1 and will be run permanently. With reduced funding, the restrictions on students are stricter than before. Huang Zhaoxiong, a standing director, will serve as the principal concurrently. Mr. Huang is very willing to sacrifice some of his energy and time to make an effort to make the school a model civil school.</p>

<p>西靑女籃球賽兩江乙勝西靑乙</p>
<p>West Qing Women's Basketball Game: Liangjiang B Wins over West Qing B</p>
<p>西靑女籃球昨賽、甲組兩江甲對綠隊一幕、改至星期三舉行、僅有乙組兩塲限期交鋒、兩江乙打來楚楚可觀、蘇廷操小姐嬌小玲瓏、大有楊森之風采、全隊聯絡並佳、西靑乙雖擁有長女諾梭夫、在敵籃下大肆活動、但投籃不準、全隊球藝亦遜、故終不免一敗、結果爲二十八對十一之比、西靑甲以十對八勝黃隊、第一節四對四、上半時八對八、西靑甲於最後一節投中一球、奪得最後勝利、</p>
<p>In yesterday's West Qing Women's Basketball Game, the scene of Liangjiang A vs. Green Team in Group A was changed to Wednesday. Only two limited-time matches were held in Group B. Liangjiang B played impressively. Miss Su Tingcao was petite and exquisite, with the style of Yang Sen. The whole team's coordination was also excellent. Although West Qing B had the eldest daughter Nosov and was very active under the enemy's basket, her shooting was inaccurate, and the team's skills were also inferior, so she inevitably lost. The result was 28 to 11. West Qing A defeated the Yellow Team 10 to 8. The first quarter was 4 to 4, and the first half was 8 to 8. West Qing A scored a goal in the last quarter and won the final victory.</p>

<p>This is what she longed for, her heart still fiercely red. (Dreamlike, blind, and elaborately extended love is equal to no love; love is possessive, the heart is singular!) Because of the restlessness of her soul and the trivialization of reason, even if she had more than anyone else, the eyes of love harbor venom; they cannot allow a third party to participate. Thus, under a resolute affirmation, she tiptoed out of the human world. The sun, air, and water were the objects of her pursuit, even if she was intertwined with poverty, pain, and a degree of emaciation that was difficult to gauge. Currently, nature is her only companion; she is not lonely, but she feels solitary. Since ancient times, no great philosopher has not become a philosophical figure through great solitude. The pressing force of great solitude often leads people to the pessimistic perspective of "all is emptiness" because the decline of life feels painful. The decline of vitality usually stems from dissatisfaction in life. For women, it is mostly due to heartbreak or dissatisfaction with their families. Further, the stimulation that society gives will cause women to fall into the so-called philosophy of pessimism. The philosophy of stoicism and the retaliatory philosophy of Lao Zhuang, as well as ancient Chinese poets, were her only good friends during her seclusion. No matter how many philosophical theories or ways to find self-deliverance there may be, physiology influences psychology. Finally, she fell into Schopenhauer's view: "The real human world has become an incurable abyss of all evils, and it is further deteriorated by the impulse of will (fame and fortune). The best policy is to clear the mind and destroy the will to seek the ultimate bliss of spiritual ascension." Thus, in a helpless and desolate situation, on a cold early winter night, she listened to the wild rain outside the window, reciting Lu Fangweng's poem "Feeling After Reading a Book on a Spring Night." "My dead bones will decay, and the annals of history will have no name. If this poem is not written, who will understand my loyal heart?" "Wanting to talk about old things with no one to share, as the sun sets, crows return and I lean on the tower again." Even if she strives for her so-called career, in the currently abnormally developed world, women's position in social competition is still small and insignificant. Therefore, a woman with a strong will to search for self-expression after the disillusionment of a fantasy, awakening from the petty love of the human world and pursuing a so-called career, will gradually die of depression in a corner room of a cold village. On a Yangtze River Steamer Zhou Han On a Yangtze River boat, because the wind was calm and the waves were smooth, there was no seasickness at all. My eyes were often open, looking everywhere, and my ears were often listening, so my knowledge and experience were greatly broadened. When the boat arrived in Wuhu, just as it docked at the pier, a middle-aged woman came into our room to stay. Originally, it was just me and a female student from Nanjing who were going home together, so there were three people, filling all three berths in the room. The female student from Nanjing, a girl in her teens, was innocent and clever. I got along well with her. Now that this middle-aged woman came in, seeing her face covered with dust, she seemed to be someone who frequented the rivers and lakes, with an experienced look. It made people feel uncomfortable at first sight. The little girl signaled to me with her eyes, making a face. She was not happy about this middle-aged woman. I wasn't happy either. Moreover, the upper and lower berths in front of the window had already been occupied by the two of us. The berth next to it was originally for us to put our boxes and baskets, but as soon as she came in, the waiter put our boxes and baskets on the ground and under the berth. How annoying! The woman brought a suitcase and a bedding roll with her. As soon as she entered the room, she told the waiter to open the bedding and spread it out, then lay down on it. She casually took out a pack of Hardman cigarettes from her small straw bag, lit one, and started smoking. You know, I get dizzy as soon as I smell cigarette smoke, so what could I do? The little girl was a student and also afraid of cigarette smoke. We were both very unhappy. The little girl was young and didn't dare to interfere, so she just opened the window to ventilate the air and covered her nose and mouth with a handkerchief. But I couldn't stand it, coughed a little, and said to the woman, "Excuse me, we are afraid of cigarette smoke, please go outside to smoke." The woman was very worldly-wise and sensible, and immediately replied, "Oh, I didn't know, sorry, sorry." She immediately stood up, opened the door, and went outside. In my life, I am not afraid of people who are unreasonable. This time, when the woman became reasonable, I felt embarrassed. I felt that she was also a passenger on the boat, and I was just a woman on the boat. Now that we had driven her outside, hadn't we deprived her of her freedom? Moreover, hadn't we two become the masters, and she become an irrelevant person? I was inexplicably lost in thought and wild thoughts. The little girl happily said to me, "She's still obedient, isn't she?" I nodded to show agreement, but couldn't say anything. What could I say, right? After the boat sailed, the woman looked for an opportunity to talk to us, asking us where we were going, where we came from, and what school we were studying at. Her attitude was so sincere, gentle, humble, and polite. Every sentence called us "Miss," and she even thought we were sisters, calling me "Eldest Miss" and the little girl "Second Miss." Could we refuse to talk to her? Of course not, so we talked and talked until we became familiar. When the boat was about to reach Anqing, she looked at the dock by the side of the boat, as if waiting for someone. As soon as the boat docked, a big man followed her into the room. She opened the box, took out a package of things, and handed it to the man. This made me suspicious. What was in the package? It must be smuggled goods. A smuggler evading taxes! After the boat sailed, I asked her what was in the package. She smiled and said, "You students are good people. To tell you the truth, I am a business person. That package is business." So it really was smuggled goods. She sighed about the hardships of life and said that she had no choice but to do this illegal thing. She said that her husband used to do this business, but he was imprisoned after being sued. She had a son and a mother at home, and the family had to eat, so she had no choice but to come out and take the risk for her husband. She envied us for being misses, who had cultivated virtue in their previous lives and were enjoying blessings in this life... I sympathized with her situation, and I was worried about her. A woman like this is also worthy of admiration. How capable! This trip on the river has broadened my horizons.

Amateur Mailbox (1) The Problem of Dividing Property Among Brothers Mr. Editor: There are three brothers. Before their father died, because the father was old and the mother died early, all the household affairs were managed by the eldest brother, and the two younger brothers studied outside, with the family providing tuition. Now that the father has died, the brothers all plan to divide the inheritance and establish their own households. However, when dividing the family, the two younger brothers said that the eldest brother had secretly saved a large sum of money while managing the household affairs (there is evidence), but the eldest brother denied this. At the same time, the eldest brother is married, and the two younger brothers are not yet married, so the younger brothers also requested that some money be set aside for their marriage expenses, and the remaining amount be divided equally. The eldest brother refused, which led to disputes. The two younger brothers decided to jointly seek a legal solution. The three brothers are all my friends, and I sincerely hope that they can settle the matter peacefully, so I especially write to you, hoping that you can provide a method to avoid going to court. Wang Yanchen Editor's Note: The inheritance issue raised by Mr. Wang is complex in content, and the editor cannot give a hasty answer based on the brief situation described. Moreover, this kind of legal dispute cannot be resolved by empty words. Therefore, it is best if both parties can understand each other and settle the matter peacefully. If the two younger brothers are determined to fight for the inheritance, they can change their approach and consult a lawyer with detailed information and evidence of the eldest brother's embezzlement, and proceed accordingly. However, the editor has an opinion on inheritance: it is believed that unearned inheritance can only cultivate people's habits of enjoying and squandering. It can also extinguish the spirit of youth and progress, and if used improperly, it is actually harmful and useless. Therefore, it is hoped that the brothers will not be concerned about the inheritance dispute, but should pay close attention to their own future and strive to achieve the goal of self-reliance. Otherwise, even with a rich inheritance, it will never last. (2) How to Learn Mandarin Mr. Editor: There are different dialects in various parts of our country, and language often causes misunderstandings. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the people of the whole country can fully implement Mandarin, which would bring many benefits. However, I myself cannot speak a single sentence of Mandarin, and I suffer greatly when talking to others, and I am especially envious of others' fluent Mandarin. Therefore, I am actively trying to learn Mandarin, but I feel that I want to learn but have no way to start. I think that you, sir, are a teacher for the people, and you should be able to solve my difficulties, so I especially write to you, hoping that you can indicate the path to learning Mandarin and introduce one or two Mandarin guidance books with self-study materials. If you agree, I will be extremely grateful. Respectfully, Bai Yu Editor's Note: To learn Mandarin, you can often talk to people who speak Mandarin, and then work hard to study on your own, and you will eventually achieve this goal over time. There is no special path. Regarding Mandarin guidance books with self-study materials, there are very few now. As for books teaching Mandarin phonetic symbols, although there are some, but at a time when these phonetic symbols are not very developed, except for a few elementary school textbooks, most other books do not use these symbols, so even if you have learned them, it doesn't seem to be of much use at present. If you want to learn this, you can buy "How to Use Mandarin Phonetic Symbols" or "Complete Book of Phonetic Symbols" from Zhonghua Book Company and take a look. It is best to have someone to guide you, otherwise it will be difficult to see results.

Blessings, gifts, and the three stars are all present. Chicken, fish, and pork fill the plate. Pine needles, cypress twigs, and winter green leaves. Bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the gods is indispensable. Thousands of households and doors all pay respect. The roadside Bodhisattva has no effort. Poor families may not come in person. Lucky money and wealth are used as substitutes. There are candles and incense that are often offered. There is no tea and no wine, it is cold and sparse.

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Architecture Weekly Architecture of the Middle Ages (Part 1) Qin We already know the history of the development of European architecture, its origin and development, and it was very prosperous as early as two thousand years ago. Art architecture spread from Egypt to Mesopotamia, then to Greece, and then the Romans promoted and carried forward their architecture. Thus, Europe has the world's famous and great architecture. But before the Greek style of architecture rose in France, there was an indestructible history in between. At this time, the Europeans were all moved by the craze for architecture, and they wanted to rival the cathedrals of Rome. But generally speaking, most of their architectural styles were pseudo-Roman, and they lacked the Roman spirit of decisiveness and courage. The people of other European nations did not know how the Romans made cement at this time, so they could not use concrete to build houses. They envied the Roman method of dome construction, so they also used small stones and bricks to imitate it. This was most prevalent in northern Italy and southern France. They did not know that the towering dome required an extremely solid pier, like the Romans' thick walls or a type of support column like the Greeks, to support the entire weight. So as a result, the buildings they built were all destroyed and could not be passed down. Although, from the general shape, scope, and carvings of these buildings, we always feel that the perseverance of the designers of this era was not bad, and their ambition can be said to be much stronger than their technology. Later, we gradually discovered steel arch ribs. The construction method of steel was used by the Romans to increase the strength of concrete, but other Europeans did not understand the construction method of steel concrete. They only used steel to support the weight of the joints of the arch ribs and the protruding parts of the house. This kind of construction method unknowingly led them to the path of Gothic style. However, the change of this architectural style cannot be explained by a single reason or aspect, because the change of architectural style must also require the designer's persistent spirit, sensitive talent, and far-sighted vision to succeed. Gothic architecture is full of powerful beauty, and this power is fluid, expressing a balanced combination, which is different from the static and harmonious beauty of Roman architecture. At the same time, its design pays much attention to the height of the building. We can imagine that many buildings at that time mostly had a high tower standing in the clouds, looking down on everything on the ground. The method and materials of construction are two very important points in Gothic design. We know that the Romans liked to use a kind of camouflage method to hide the rough parts inside. In the Gothic style, architects no longer use camouflage methods to seek the beauty of the building. They like to pay attention to the organization of materials and the inseparable and unified nature of each part. Sometimes they prefer to use unbalanced or asymmetrical architectural forms, which can often show a unique aesthetic. New Residential Architecture and Sanitary Design Xi Hao The importance of sanitary design in new residential architecture can be said to have been completely ignored by architects a dozen years ago. In recent years, although this issue has gradually been valued by general engineers, it still fails to be as "sanitary" as possible in actual architectural design. This is an important responsibility that current engineers cannot shirk. We know that residential architecture is the daily residence of ordinary people. Its sanitary design is related to the health of each resident. At the same time, it can also affect the health of other adjacent units. Therefore, European and American architects regard this "sanitary design" as a prerequisite for residential architecture, which is also a feature of 20th century architecture, and it is worth our attention and research. The first issue of sanitary design in new residential architecture is of course the issue of "air." Air is something that people cannot lack for a moment, as everyone knows, but how to replace an appropriate amount of fresh air in residential architecture is really a big problem in architecture. In smog-filled cities, obtaining an appropriate amount of clean air for ventilation is a problem that general engineers find difficult to solve. Although automatic ventilation fans can replace the fresh air in the room, they cannot eliminate all the smoke and dust and gases saturated in the air. Now, larger residential buildings in European and American countries are equipped with small air compressors. The outside air is first compressed to wash away all kinds of smoke and other impurities, and then piped into various parts of the house, and the used air is disposed of. Although this system is good, it is not suitable for small-scale residences. For the sake of economic requirements, in addition to installing automatic ventilation fans, an air purifier is installed behind this fan, which is a very fine return copper mesh, which can prevent the passage of extremely fine smoke or unclean particles in the air. However, it is impossible to isolate all odorous gases (such as carbon dioxide and sulfur trioxide in automobile exhaust). Now, although some engineers have invented a method of coating certain compounds on air purifiers to remove these gases, it is still in the experimental stage, and we can hardly predict the results. The only remedy at present is to plant evergreen trees around the house, because they have a very strong natural cleaning effect, but the issue of location is really something that every engineer should design. The second issue of sanitary design is the issue of "light." At first glance, this issue does not seem to have much to do with the lives of ordinary people. In fact, this is not the case. The issue of "light" can shift the entire body and mind's happiness, and it is enough to affect the entire body's nerves and health. We have to engage in meticulous design. Light can be roughly divided into two categories, namely natural sunlight and artificial light. South-facing residences have the best light, so designers should try to open windows facing south as much as possible to introduce a large amount of sunlight, which not only comforts people's body and mind, but also kills mold in the air. The windows in other directions should pay attention to the appropriate area during the design, and the proper color arrangement of the wall decoration will improve your light, which is also something that should be paid attention to.

Drier | (Prier) If the paint requires its inherent quick-drying properties, then it can only be mixed with some drier. A drier is a very dry substance. Middle Transom | What is a middle transom (Tram son)? It is a horizontal transom that separates the waist (Fan Light) and the door (Door) of the hall. Stile | It is a term for a kind of material in the organization of doors and windows. It is divided into middle stile (Lock Style), side stile (Side style) and other names. Rail | Rail is also a term for a kind of material in the organization of doors and windows. It has top rail (Top Rail), middle rail (Lock Rail), and bottom rail (Bottom Rail). In addition to this, there are many kinds of terms for the materials on doors and windows, such as panel, concave line, and betel nut. Door Stop | (Door Stop) (Fearing that the handle of the door (Handle), whether it is made of porcelain, glass or copper, may sometimes be damaged by a strong push, or may damage the plaster on the wall, so a bump stop is nailed on the floor (Floor) or skirting (Skirting) to prevent the force. It is made of wood and the shape is square or round. Tie Bar | Scaffolding is built on the base of tall buildings. When building, because the length of bamboo or wood is not enough, it must be built layer by layer. The horizontal one is called a tie bar, and the vertical ones are called sky-piercing, the one that puts the scaffolding board is called horizontal rib, and the two intersecting ones that prevent shaking are called throwing support. These all belong to the scaffolding. Scratch Coat | The first coat of plaster applied by the plasterer on the wall is called scratch coat. Ordinary clay mud is mostly used, and yellow sand clay mud is also used, but this is not commonly used for ordinary street houses. Set Back | (Set Back) If the height of the house or the width of the road line exceeds the regulations of the Public Works Bureau's construction code: it must be set back (for example, the road is set back a few feet, the house is set back a few feet), and the large square foot under the wall (Footing) is initially wider than the wall, and then it is gradually reduced, which is also called set back (for example, set back twenty inches, set back fifteen inches.) Floating Bridge | (Moving) The most difficult thing in the construction site is transporting materials. When the first floor of the house is built, it is necessary to rely on the floating bridge to place the joist.

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Film Supplement Bette Davis on the Lessons Hollywood Taught Her Shu Min Bette Davis, the female lead in "Of Human Bondage," was mistaken for a woman who hated women after performing in "Bondage." Because she performed so deeply, people who watched "Bondage" hated the shameless waitress in it and despised women in general. In fact, she was just acting as much as possible, vividly and realistically. She herself is a woman, she also has girlfriends, how could she hate women? Bette is not only a keen observer. She is also one of the most clear-headed women in Hollywood. Her art is not superficial imitation, but personal experience. Her family life is also very rational, which is unique in Hollywood. Her husband, Harmon Nelson, is a pianist in a hotel. She herself is a star, earning about $1,000 a week. But her family living expenses are based on her husband's salary, and she lives within her means. She herself goes to the studio every day in a large new car. That is a must according to her star status. But usually when she goes out to play with her husband, she sits with her husband in a broken car. This is what makes her special, and what ordinary people in Hollywood are unwilling to do. But her reasons are very sufficient, and not entirely on saving, although that is also very important. A female actor's days are very short. She has to try to save money in preparation for the future. But Bette's biggest reason is not just saving money. She said that all self-loving men have a sense of self-respect and independence, and do not like to rely on women's income for a living. She herself is a female star, and her husband is a pianist with a low position, but she does not want him to feel inferior in his profession. She always wants her husband to know that it is not he who relies on her, but she who relies on him. The man is the head of the family and should bear the economic responsibility of the family. Therefore, the common living expenses of their family are borne by her husband, but each of them also has their own private accounts. I'm afraid I've talked too much nonsense. What I want to say here is that Bette has keen observation and rich experience. Because of keen observation and rich experience, there is thorough understanding and rational action. The following are some lessons she said she learned from Hollywood, which can be used as a life lesson for general film practitioners: Living in Hollywood is like living anywhere else, and personal harmony is essential. If you live in a completely ideal, utopian world, then you can enjoy absolute freedom, do whatever you want, and say whatever you want. But our world is not an ideal world. Therefore, we must harmonize with reality and the environment, no matter where you are. But there is one difference in Hollywood: it is very easy for a person to harmonize too much, lose himself, and become part of Hollywood. In short, it is to lose your own personality. This may be because you have trained yourself too harshly in the glory of the film industry. When you get to Hollywood, the first lesson you will learn is to restrain your temper. You must be able to endure being punished, harshly criticized, and all kinds of insults, and remember that they are all beneficial to your career and art. In this peace of mind to endure, you often over-compromise, follow anyone's will, lose your own judgment, and lose your own personality. "Also, the easiest problem to make in Hollywood is the loss of sincerity, because if you live in Hollywood for a long time, you will learn that personal opinions cannot be expressed arbitrarily. In this way, it often flows into hypocrisy. "In Hollywood, you cannot expect the outside world to praise your work. Therefore, to compensate for that lack, you cannot but have your own appreciation. However, unless you understand yourself, you often become arrogant or use affected forms to create special images in others. "You must realize the necessity of thrift early on, and not spend all of your income. The greatest danger in Hollywood is that when you earn a lot of money, you feel extremely embarrassed to spend less money, which is not in line with your status. In fact, it is all caused by the drive of an unconscious vanity. You must understand how long your high salary will last. It is based on the public's preferences, and the public's preferences are extremely unreliable and sometimes incomprehensible. "From the first day you step into the film industry, you must be close to the press, treat the representatives of the press honestly and without deception, and provide them with real news. This does not mean that you must use the people in the press to promote yourself. Their advice and criticism, whether printed on paper or delivered in person, is worthy of your humble acceptance. Film Review "College Life" Ji Han Bachelor Arts - Cathay With a slightly satirical stance, using the thoughts, lives, and dynamics of college students as the theme, and giving vulgar sermons to young students, this is to explain the essence of "College Life." In more detail, the playwright's views are very ordinary. He said that a student from a wealthy family should study hard, not waste money, be able to endure hardship, and do his best to help the poor professor couple, but must not believe in socialism, and may as well fall in love with a working girl. On the other hand, he wrote about a female student who earns her own income to study, and she falls in love with a wealthy son, and makes the wealthy son sincerely love her. In order to emphasize his thematic sermon, he described the followers of socialism in a satirical way as being either bookworms or agitators, and when the wealthy son wore a top hat to attend a gathering of socialist believers, he immediately gave him a punishment. As for the students who specialize in pleasure-seeking, they are naturally also ridiculed. It is gratifying that the American college student group is very vividly sketched, but it teaches the students in the turbulent era to live an ordinary life. The success of this sketch is a kind of evil effect of cuteness. In other words, precisely because it makes people feel cute, it gives the audience a bad influence. Yes, people will feel a little lightness in this film, but the dullness exceeds the lightness. Separating the technical aspects, then from the director to the actors, they all show vulgarity. We do not despise the male and female protagonists because of their lack of fame, but in fact their acting skills are very unfamiliar. Relatively speaking, the male protagonist is more skilled than the female protagonist. The Hair Braid Issue in "Red Sheep Biography" Yi The sound giant film "The Legend of the Red Sheep Hero," which cost more than 100,000 yuan and took ten months to produce, has now been completed and is scheduled to be released. The production of this film is completely different from the dance hero drama. All costumes and backgrounds strive to be true to the situation at that time. The management and layout have taken a lot of thought. However, there is one point that has to be slightly contrary to the facts. Originally, in the former Qing Dynasty, people each had a hair braid, hanging behind their heads, which was extremely ugly in shape. Westerners therefore added the words "pig tail" to ridicule it. Now, the screen characters in "The Legend of the Red Sheep" do not have the special decoration of hair braids, because this hair braid is detrimental to the national image. After comparison, it is felt that the national image is insulted, and the relationship is not shallow. Slightly contrary to the facts is a minor matter. Moreover, the actions of the screen characters are mostly frontal and less reverse, and the cancellation of the hair braid does not cause a strange feeling. It is said that the staff of Xinhua Company had many discussions on the hair braid issue before they resolutely cancelled it. "Empty Valley Orchid" Song Giveaway The</p>

<p>Lasting Over a Month, Passing Through More Than Ten Counties</p>
<p>Mr. Ni Bingyao, a member of the Wu Yu Boy Scout Corps of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Regiments of the Chinese Boy Scouts, determined to walk across all of Zhejiang. He trekked thousands of miles and set off at the end of last year, passing through Hang County, Yuyao, Fenghua, Yin County, Huangyan, Zhoushan, Taizhou, and other places. He conducted on-the-spot research and investigation into the local rural economy and the state of Boy Scout education. He will record his impressions in detail in a manual. Once it has been refined and polished, he plans to contribute it to the Boy Scout community of the entire city as a reference. Mr. Ni returned to Shanghai on the 27th of this month. He told a Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday that he received generous treatment from the local military, political, and academic circles in the places he passed through, and also received inscriptions and signatures from celebrities as souvenirs. As for the goals of this trip: (1) To broaden his knowledge and understanding of the rural conditions in the Chinese interior; (2) To encourage the interest in activities of those who come later, hoping that there will be frequent excursions in the Boy Scout world in the future. It is said that all members of the Wu Yu Corps held a banquet for Mr. Ni last night at the Southeast Hongyun Restaurant to welcome him back, and the corps leader presented him with a medal on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Circumstances of Principal Jia of Zhaohe Resigning <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The sudden resignation of Jia Botao, the principal of Zhaohe Middle School, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The reporter specially visited him yesterday. According to Mr. Jia, the establishment of Zhaohe Middle School was jointly initiated by Mayor Wu, Director Yang, and advanced figures from the Party-State and society. He had put in a lot of effort. However, because he felt that he was not particularly good at education, even though he was cautious in his daily work and worked hard to develop the school, he was deeply afraid of increasing his guilt. Therefore, he had long wanted to get out of it. However, it was not easy to convene the board of directors, and the various funds were not yet settled, so he could not bear to leave. Now, fortunately, the central government's subsidies have been successively issued, the various equipment and scale are roughly prepared, and land acquisition and construction have also been carried out. After several years of running around, fortunately, there has been no mishap. Therefore, taking advantage of the change of semesters, he resolutely resigned, and handed over all school equipment, documents, seals, books, instruments, and deposits to Vice Chairman Yang for inventory. He firmly believed that future leaders would be able to maintain the glorious history of the past and work harder. He hoped that the old colleagues and students would work and study with peace of mind and jointly open up a bright future. This would be the school's fortune and also his great comfort.</p>
