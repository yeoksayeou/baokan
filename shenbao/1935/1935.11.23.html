<h3>埃及之反英運動</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>自英意邦交緊張以來。埃及對英關係。始終採取合作友好態度。唯就近一週來之事態觀之。英國在埃及之地位。又發生重大波動。是誠出人意外之發展。甚值得我人之注意者也。</p>
<p>埃及之於英國。經濟上雖不甚重要。然就其地理形勢以觀。。埃及實爲大英帝國盛衰之關鍵。故拿坡倫曾謂。「欲制英國之死命。首在控制埃及。」及蘇彝士運河開通而後。埃及所處之地位。實握英國交通綫之樞紐。此地若爲另一强國所佔。固足以促大英帝國之崩裂。卽埃及完全獨立。亦非英國之利。故大戰以後。埃及國民黨屢次要求完全獨立。並曾推派代表。出席巴黎和會。但均爲英國所阻。其代表且爲英人一度拘禁。卽一九二二年英國宣佈放棄以埃及爲保護國時。仍不能不保留如下之條件。（一）卽無論任何時期。英國在埃。享有特殊地位。埃及外交必須與英國駐埃總監發生密切之聯絡。（二）埃及政付非得英政府之許可。不得與任何外國締結政治條約。卽欲與外國發生外交關係。亦須由英政府帮助。（三）英政府在埃負有保護外人合法利益之責任。（四）英政府有助埃及防守其領土及維持帝國交通之責任。爲達此項責任計。英軍得隨時通過埃及境內。或駐兵其間。（五）埃及軍隊及政府機關非得英國駐埃總監之同意。不得聘任外國軍事敎官與政府顧問。同時非得英國駐埃財政監察之同意。不得舉借外債。觀此數點。英國雖許埃及獨立。然於外交及國防問題。則仍予以餒格之統制。旣不許其完全自主。更不欲其他强國之問津。故顧名思義。英國所予埃及之獨立。實質上依然一保護國之地位。其後國民黨每作反英運動。英卽報之以嚴峻手叚。一九三零年埃王廢止一九二三年之憲法。而代以新憲法。削减國會議員名額。集大權於己身。亦出于英人之策動。蓋所以遏制國民黨之勢力也。凡此種種行爲。皆爲英國欲圖控制蘇彝士運河之動機所使然。就今日之國際形勢觀察。英國對於蘇彝士運河之控制。尤見其需要之殷。故英國對於埃及瀰漫全國勢如怒潮之反英運動。究將若何應付。誠一極有趣味之問題也。</p>
<p>埃及今茲之反英運動。爲國民黨所繳起。此無可疑者。按國民黨之主張。自來欲求埃及之擺脫英國覊絆而完全獨立。同時使蘇彝士運河中立化。蘇丹交還埃及。內政外交絕對自主。惟現國會內。國民黨勢力微弱。頗難左右政局。故其煽起民衆反英情緒。發爲大規模之民衆運動。實爲事勢所必至。惟我人須注意者。卽英國對於埃及獨立所保留之條件。必不易讓步。蓋一讓步。大英帝國卽將感受極大之威脅。且埃及方面完全擺脫英國覊絆之後。對於其他黷武國家。有無自衛能力。亦爲一疑問。雖然。我人對於埃及再接再厲之民族運動。不能不致其欽佩。蓋受制於人。爲一切有血氣之民族所不能忍受。而取于毅然反抗者。乃爲奮發有爲之民族也。</p>

<h3>蘇聯斯泰哈諾夫運動　史丹琳演說闡明意義與目的　提高勞動生產完成工業革命</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）史丹林於全聯邦斯泰哈諾夫運動大會席上，發表演說如下，</p>
<p>斯泰哈諾夫運動並非尋常的男女工人遝動，而爲蘇聯社會主義建設史上最光榮之一頁。此項運動之意義果何在乎？第一，彼爲社會主義競爭之新的高潮，爲社會主義競爭新的更高的階段。曷言乎新？曷言乎更高？因其與社會主義競爭之過去階段極易分別也。過去三年內，社會主義競賽初未與新的技術保持必然的聯繁。嚴格言之，彼時吾人並無新技術，而在社會主義競賽之現階段，斯泰哈諾夫運動已與新的技術發生必然的聯繫。此項運動如無新的更高的技術，則不能設想其爲何物。諸君眼前有斯泰哈諾夫·布蘇金·斯末丹甯·克列伏諾司·布洛甯·維諾格拉杜等類人物·彼等均爲新人物，新工人，彼等已能完全駕馭其技術，且能推進之。三年以前吾人並無此等人物。彼等爲新的特殊人物。</p>
<p>斯泰哈諾夫運動之目的，在超過目前之技術標準，超過目前之工作容量，超過目前之生產計劃與平衡。因此，彼等欲克服對於吾人之時代及吾儕新人物已屬過去之紀錄。此項運動打破技術之舊觀念，打破技術之舊紀錄，舊的工作容量，舊的生產計劃。彼要求建立新的爭高的紀錄，工作容量，及生產計劃。</p>
<p>彼要求完成吾人之工業革命。由此言之，斯泰哈諾夫運動乃深切的具有革命性質。此間已有人謂，斯泰哈諾夫運動爲新的更高的技術標準之表現，爲社會主義高度勞動生產率　在資本主義社會絕不可能）之標樣。此點絕對正確。</p>
<p>資本主義何以能摧毀並克服封建主義乎？因彼能產生更高的勞動生產率紀錄，能使社會獲得較對建社會更多之產物。資本主義之克服封建主義，乃因其令社會較爲富裕。社會主義何以必能且必將擊敗資本主義經濟制度乎？此無他，因彼能產生較資本主義經濟制度更高的勞動生產率之實例，因彼與資本主義經濟制度相較能提供社會更多產物，且能使社會更富也。若干人以爲吾人得於貧苦生活之基礎上，平均資產，以鞏固社會主義，此種意見絕不正確，此爲小資產階級之社會主義思想。實際言之，社會主義如欲勝利，則須有高於資本主義之勞動生產率爲基礎，須以豐富之產物與各種商品爲基礎，須以一切社會成員富裕而文化的生活爲基礎。雖然，吾人欲達此項目的，欲令吾社會主義社會最爲繁榮，則吾人須有超過各大資本主義國家之勞動生產率。否則，吾人如欲豐富之產物與商品則徒勞無功耳。</p>
<p>斯泰哈諾夫運動之意義，即在打破以往不充分之技術紀錄，超過各大資本主義國家之勞動生產率，由此而產生蘇聯社會主義更加鞏固之可能，以及轉變吾國爲最繁榮的國家之可能。「雖然，斯泰哈諾夫運動之意義猶不盡於此，彼復準備社會主義過渡爲共產主義之前提。社會主義之原則，乃各盡所能各取所值，（並非各取所需）。其意蓋曰，其時工人階級文化及技術水準尚不甚高，勞心勞力之矛盾仍然存在，勞動生產率仍未能產生豐富之商品，故其時社會尚未能按照各人需要分配產物，而僅按其工作分量，定其報酬。</p>
<p>「共產主義在發展上爲一更高之階段，共產主義之原則爲各盡所能，各取所需，產物分配非按工作分量，而按各個文化水準甚高之成員之需要，其意蓋日，其時工人階級之文化技術水準，已極優越，足以消滅勞心勞力之矛盾，勞動生產率已極提高，足以保證豐富之產品，故其時產物分配得按其所需。</p>
<p>或謂腦力勞動與體力勞動之對立，可以降低工程師，技師與腦力勞勳者之文化及技術水準，使腦力勞動與體力勞動之文化及技術處於同一水準，即以此法消滅此種對立，此乃絕對錯誤。祇有小資產階級空談者能妄想如此實現共產主義。實則腦力勞動與體力勞動對立之消滅，唯有提高勞動階級之文化技術水準，使與工程及技術專家相等，方能達到。「如謂此種提高决不可能，實爲可笑思想。在蘇維埃制度之下，該國生產力已自資本主義鎖練之中解放，勞動已自壓迫剝削之中解放，勞動階級業已取得政權，勞動者之子女已得各種機會，以獲得充分之技術敎育，此種提高乃爲絕對可能。唯有提高勞動階級方面文化及技術，方能消滅腦力勞動與體力勞動間之矛盾根源，方能提高勞動生產性，以獲得自社會主義轉入共產主義所必需之豐富商品，此乃毫無懷疑餘地。</p>
<p>「斯泰哈諾夫運動足爲此種轉換之關聯，因彼對於提高我國勞動階級文化及技術水準，已開其端雖尚柔弱，但終不失爲一端霓。斯泰哈諾夫運動即爲人民已能完全控制彼等工作技術，並自技術索取最高限度之收穫。目下斯泰哈諾夫運動者雖僅少數，但誰能疑其不久以後即將增至十倍乎？斯泰哈諾夫運動者爲我工業中之發明家，期泰哈諾夫運動表示我工業之前途，其中包含將來提高勞動階級文化及技術水準之種子，彼已爲我等闢一道路，惟有順此前進，方能提高勞動生產性至最高程度，俾得自社會主義轉入共產主義，並消滅腦力勞動與體力勞動間之對立，此豈非顯而易見者乎？</p>
<p>「余等現臨斯泰哈諾夫運動之搖籃，臨其發軔，必須注意斯泰哈諾夫運動之若干特點；第一，此項運動似係自發，幾全自下而上，毫不出於余等各企業之管理處之逼迫。</p>
<p>「其次，此項運動，一經開始，立即向前發展；不問余等各企業之管理處之意向如何，甚且與之鬥爭。正因其爲出於自發，正因其爲自下而上，故爲現時代之最重要且不可測度之運動。「斯泰哈諾夫運動之另一特點，即爲遍一全國；且非逐漸發展，而以迅雷疾電之無比速度前進。斯泰哈諾夫運動已爲絕對成熟事件，此點究將如何解釋？何物使其迅速發展？</p>
<p>斯泰哈諾夫運動之根源何在？其理由至少可有四點：</p>
<p>「第一，斯泰哈諾夫運動首先出於勞動者物質生活條件之澈底改進。同志生活已見改善。生活已較前快樂；生活快樂，工作亦必進步。於是產量增高？於是而有勞動男女英雄，此乃斯泰哈諾夫運動之最重要之根源。如余等亦有恐慌，亦有勞動階級之失業瘟疫，如余等之生活惡劣，毫無快樂，毫無希望，如此則余等必無斯泰哈諾夫運動（鼓掌）。余等之無產階級革命，爲全世界能使人民得一機會，不僅顯示其政治結果，且能顯示其物質生活結果之唯一革命。「唯有余等之革命，不僅摧毀資本主義之梏極，而予人民以自由，且能予人民繫榮生活之物質條件。此中藏有余等革命之勢力及不可勝性。此即余等生活所以歡樂，及發生斯泰哈諾夫運動之理由。</p>
<p>「第二，斯泰哈諾夫運動田於我國剝削制度之消滅。我國人民非爲剝削者工作，非爲富裕之不勞動者工作，乃爲彼等自己工作，爲其自己階級工作，爲其優良人民，即勞動階級掌握政權之蘇維埃社會工作。此所以余等之工作能有社會意義，且爲崇高及光榮之事業也。在資本主義下，勞動乃爲私人性質，因此資本主義下之人類勞動不被重視。在此情形之下，决不能有斯泰哈諾夫運動明矣。「尚有關於蘇維埃制度之另一事件，此間勞動者受人尊敬，此間勞動者不被蔑視，不感孤獨。反之，勞動者與余等均感自身爲一自己國家之自由人民，爲一社會工作者，如其工作優良，能向社會盡其所能，彼即爲一勞動英雄，彼即滿載榮譽。祗有在此情形之下，方有斯太哈諾夫運動，此乃至爲明顯。</p>
<p>「斯泰哈諾夫運動之第三來源，即爲我國已有新技術之存在。斯泰哈諾夫運動自始即與新技術結不解因緣，苟無新技術，無新工廠及新機械，則斯泰哈諾夫運動亦必不能發生於我國。苟無新技術，技術水準祇能增加一倍或二倍，不能更多。如技術水準增至五倍六倍，此即表示彼等完全建築於新技術上，此即表示我國之工業化，我國工廠之改造，新技術與新機械之存在，已爲斯泰哈諾夫運動闢一道路。」但僅有新技術，亦不能使余等如此進步。縱有第一等之技術，縱有第一等之工廠，但無人能超越此種技術，技術亦僅技術而已。欲使新技術能產生其效果，必須史有力能主宰技術，推進技術之人民，幹部，及男女工人。</p>
<p>「斯泰哈諾夫運動之產生與發展，表示在余等男女工人中已有此種幹部躍起。二年以前，黨謂余等雖有新工廠，雖有新機械予各種金業，然余等工作，尚僅完成一半。黨謂建築新工廠之熱忱，必須以主宰新工廠之熱忱爲其補充。唯有如此，方能大功告成。在此二年中，主宰新機械及培養新幹部之工作顯已進行，顯然余等現已有如此幹部。如無此等新人民，余等必無任何斯泰哈諾夫運動，此極易解。因此力能主宰新技術之出自男女工人之新人民，業已形成一種勢力，以產生並推進斯泰哈諾夫運動。</p>
<p>「余謂斯泰哈諾夫運動非漸次發展，乃如水之决閘。顯然，彼已克服種種障礙·有人將其阻扼，有人將其困撓，今則斯泰哈諾夫運動已積聚力量，衝破重重障碍，泛濫全國。此語云何？誰爲此種運動之眞實障碍？此即陳舊技術水準，及保障此種水準之人民。「若干年前，余等之工程師，技術及經濟工人適應技術落後之余等男女工人，建立某種技術水準。自此以後，又經數年。在此期間，人民已漸發展，獲得技術基礎，而技術水準則未變更。此種水準，已為余等新人民之障礙，此極明顯。余等豈能仍復效忠於余等之落後乎？余等豈能以余等男女工人之永保落後爲出發點乎？余等似仍未能自此問題更進一步。何則？或因余等未有充分勇氣，以擊破余等若千工程師及技師之保守主義，擊破陳舊傳統及水準，使勞動階級之翻勢力得以充分發展，非此而何？</p>
<p>「彼等言及科學。據云若干關於技術材料書籍發表命令，反對斯泰哈諾夫運動者提高技術水準之要求。但此間所謂科學，究指何物？科學村料常被實行及經驗所阻扼。力能擊破其與實行及經騐間之聯繫者，究爲何種科學？科學之稱爲科學，正因其能否認因襲思想，不畏舉手反抗正趨死亡之過去，並靜聽經騐及實行之聲息。「苟非如此，余等將無任何科學。試以天文爲例，余等將固守普托洛美氏之過時理論體系。余等將無生物學，而仍求慰於人類創造傳說。余等將無化學，而仍固守煉金術士之預言。此即余所以常以爲余等之工程，技術，經濟工作人員，每遠落斯泰哈諾夫運動之後，彼等必須放棄其陳舊技術水準，置身於斯泰哈諾夫道路之中，始能有成也。或將問余，一般而論，技術水準究將如何改革？或謂余等已不需任何技術水準。此亦錯誤。且爲愚蠢。「如無技術水準，計劃經濟將不可能。此外，技術水準且爲促使落後大衆，使其追及前進工人水準之所必需。技術水準乃爲一大調劑力量，能在工業中組織勞動大衆於勞動階級領導份子之周圍。因此余等需要技術水準，但非現有水準，而為更高水準。</p>
<p>「又有人謂，技術水準仍屬必需；但須增至斯泰哈諾夫，布西金斯，維諾格拉道夫斯等所達水準。此亦錯誤。此種水準在現時尚不可能；因技術較落後之男女工人，必不能完成此種水準也。余等所需技術水準，乃介於現有水準及斯泰哈諾夫等水準之間。「無論如何，有一事極顯明，此即現有技術水準已與事實不符是也。彼已落後，已成余等工業之阻扼；爲使工業發展不致受阻，必須以新而更高至技術水準代職。新人民，新時代，新技術水準·</p>
<p>「自斯泰哈諾夫運動之利益而言，余等將來之任務爲何？第一，余等之任務爲帮助斯泰哈諾夫運動者之運動，使其繼續發展，使其普及且深入蘇聯各省各區。另一方面，余等須約東經濟，工程，技術工作人員中之各種頑固守舊份子，彼等不願前進，彼等有系統地阻扼斯泰哈諾夫運動。「余以爲如余等能完成此種工作，斯泰哈諾夫運動必能充分發展，必能囊括全國各地，示余等以新成就之奇蹟。</p>
<p>「尚須再作數言，說明此次大會及其意義。列甯會謂眞正領袖，布爾塞維克黨員，必爲不僅敎導工晨，且自工農學習之人。若干黨員對於列甯此語不願接受。但歷史顯示列甯在此亦爲百分之一百之正確。百萬工農確在勞動，生活，鬬爭。誰復能謂彼等乃在盲生活，不在生活與鬬爭中累積巨大經驗乎？誰復能疑忽視此種經騐之領袖，將不成爲領袖乎？因此，余等黨國領袖，不僅須敎導勞動者，且須自彼等學習。余不否認，君等出席此次大會，已自政府領袖獲得若干敎育，同時余等政府領袖，亦自君等斯泰哈諾夫運動者受敎甚多，此亦不能否認。同志，感謝君等，感謝君等所給余之敎訓。」（掌聲雷動）（二十二日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>京滬魯黃渡附近　連夜發生警匪格鬥　　匪徒六人圖刧路警槍械　路警中兩槍生命無危險</h3>
<p>京滬路爲都門出入唯一幹綫、平時中外冠蓋、絡繹不絕、該路當局、爲維護行車安全起見、最近更組織工警會哨、全綫遞傳路牌、每夜不息、防衛可謂至密、詎料二十日及二十一日兩夜、該路黃渡站附近、連夜發現匪徒與路警開槍格鬥、致槍傷路警一名、事關鐵路安全、爰將探得詳情、分誌於次、</p>
<p>黑夜查道</p>
<p>警匪格鬥</p>
<p>二十日夜八時許、黃渡站附近二十五公里、查道護路警士趙學民、正循路查道時、忽迎面突遇匪徒六人、兩人各手持盒子槍、均着藍布短衣袴、有一匪人首先操北方口音喝問該警做何工作、繼卽勒令繳槍、該警知已遇匪、急開槍射擊、雙方遂起格鬥、旋因該警身中兩槍、登膛子彈亦已用罄、遂爲一匪攔腰抱住、該警抵死掙扎、趁手並將槍枝投入路旁泥汚溝中、正在互搏間、</p>
<p>軍警會捕</p>
<p>未見匪踪</p>
<p>時夜車適過、該警狂鳴警笛不已、匪徒覓槍未獲、遂呼嘯竄遁、移時黃渡駐警及保安隊憲兵、均得警報馳往援應、見趙警倒臥血泊、一面急救、送至車站搭車護送來滬救治、一面卽搜索匪踪、四下窮追、九時許、上海北站路警段段長鍾健魂據報、立派武裝員警多名、特開警備專車馳往、會同軍憲兜捕、並卽親自前往、與當地駐軍聯絡、將附近所有村落四面包圍、二十一日侵晨、卽入各村搜查、結果未獲、至當夜所派循滬翔綫堵截匪徒之員警、亦於次晨報吿、並未發現匪踪、</p>
<p>傷警無虞</p>
<p>失槍檢獲</p>
<p>傷警趙學民、自送入兩路醫院後、傷勢並無變化、所中兩彈、一在左臂、一在右腿、性命之虞、聞該警係廣西梧州人、現年二十七歲、曾在第七軍充當班長、膂力過人、故此次遇匪格鬥、以一敵六、終未爲所害、現該警當時投入泥溝之手槍、已經按址撈出、故路警段各長官、對該警之奮勇護路、頗致嘉勉、至黃渡一帶、亦已增加實力、以期遇有匪警、隨時消弭云、</p>
<p>匪徒復現</p>
<p>戒備仍嚴</p>
<p>探悉二十一日深夜十二時半、黃渡方面仍於前晚發現匪徒、原處又有匪徒開槍情事、幸駐警與軍憲立時集中開槍對射、匪方未能得逞、查京滬路向甚平靖、近年來以農村破產、遂致匪徒滋蔓、到處不寗、現路警務段方面爲遏止禍源計、除加派警力外、並已曉喩沿綫村莊父老鄉保、遇有形跡可疑、或操異鄉口音者、立卽報知、以淸匪源、</p>

<h3>德國的「公寸波」</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>因無綫電事業的發達，無綫電台日有增加，現在的波段，已感不敷分配，對於將來增設的電台，當然更覺辣手；所以五公尺以下，一公尺以上的超短波段，已逐漸被發掘而供諸實用，卽波長不足一公尺的「公寸波Decimeter　Waves，指在十份之一公尺以上，一公尺以下的電波），在最近一二年內，亦經德國的德律風根公司（Telefunken　Co．）秘密加以有系統的試騐，將來亦有供實際使用的可能。</p>
<p>公寸波的波長不到一公尺，所以週率高至三萬萬次以上，在此種高週率電流之下，普通無綫電機中的另件大半已不適用，故試騐時，均經另行製造。</p>
<p>發射機亦爲特別設計，所用振盪管則採用特製的「哈朋氏眞空管」（Haban　Tube），卽分格屏極式電磁管（SplitMagnetron）。發射機的綫路及哈朋氏管的內部構造如甲圖。管中有一陰極，其外圍有圓筒形而分裂爲四片的屏極（如甲圖左上角）；其相對的二片用電綫聯接而接出管外，如圖中虛綫部份所示。使用時屏極接有正電壓，管外則置有磁力極强的電磁石；自陰極射出的電子，一方受屏電壓吸引而趨向屏極，同時則受管外電磁石的作用而折回陰極，故起振盪作用，而便振盪電路產生電波也。</p>
<p>接收機中的眞空管，有三極管二極管二種，亦係特別製造，尺寸均極小，使電子在眞空管中通過的時間，能减至最小。試騐結果，知此種二極管，雖波長短至四十公分，亦能工作滿意。</p>
<p>試騐時曾用此種公寸波指揮船舶進港，結果極好。又會以二組收發機，用同一波長，在相距極近之處，同時收發；據云能各自工作，彼此不相干擾。</p>
<p>乙圖爲手提式公寸波發射機，及其反射鏡。丙圖爲公寸波接收機的天綫裝置。丁圖爲哈朋氏眞空管，其外置有電磁石。</p>
<h3>歐美播音施設槪况</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>工欲善其事，必先利其器。</p>
<p>近世無綫電之發達，大有一日千里之概，然而果欲求得成績良好而效果偉著，那末不但對於播音機，和收音機，就是對於播音裝置，或種種設施，或管理制度，亦應深加注意，才能臻於完善之境：這是無庸疑問的。</p>
<p>現在特將最近歐美各國播音臺的設施和制度略述於下。以上海播音臺之多，收音機之盛，想可一作他山之石吧！</p>
<p>歐美諸播音臺，鑒於現在播音機和收音機差不多可說已經達到完善之境，於是最近乃改轉而注重播音室的設備。</p>
<p>播音室構造最重要之點，有二：其一，須能與外界之聲音噪音完全絕緣；其次須使內部所發出的聲音，能够保持良好的音質。</p>
<p>爲欲達到上述兩個目的，歐美諸大播音臺的播音室，煞費苦心，有用二英寸至四英寸厚的石綿粘着於播音室之四壁及地板與承塵者（如美國紐約的N·BC·播音室），有敷配以木塊者（如德國萊伯智希Leipzig播音臺），亦有用水壓機以開閉播音室的壁門，俾得適宜調節「殘響」的程度者。</p>
<p>至於播音室構造，則因制度之不　。而新大陸和歐洲諸國，各異其趣。</p>
<p>在美國許多播音臺，除播音給收音者聆聽之外，並許民衆跑進播沓室直接聆聽他們的播音，每次祇須費四毫錢買張門票，無論何人，都可進去。所以美國之播音室中，大者竟足以收容二千以上的直接聽衆；其可收容一二百人之播音室，則極普通之事。因欲防止此種臺衆的噪聲雜音起見，此種播音室，多特別用玻璃將奏演臺密圍隔開，使在其中的奏演者種種動作和表情雖可看得到而聲沓却不能直接聽到。玻璃屋子裏所演奏的音樂，則另用一種特殊的「擴聲機」傳出給玻璃屋子外的聽衆聆聽。這種擴聲機，祇能使玻璃室內的昔樂傳出，而絕不使崖子外聽衆的噪聲跑進；故雖有數千的聽衆在，而無綫電的播昔却不受任何影響。現在總說美國無綫電播音臺中之有此種玻璃屋子之播音室者，約有三十餘家云。</p>
<p>英穗諸國則反是。他們雖然也很注意播音室的施設而力加改良，但他們除有特殊關係者而外，概不淮隨意跑進播音室裏直接聆聽，所以他們的播音室自然也沒有像美國那樣築得規模宏大的必要；至於播音室中的玻璃屋子，在他們尤認爲「無用之長物」。</p>
<p>至於播音臺所用的電力，美國與歐洲亦恰恰相反。</p>
<p>美國，因其受他國電波之影響較少，故其播音臺所用電力，以一百瓦特左右者居多，其數竟有六百餘所之鉅；五十基羅以上者頗少，全國僅二十餘處而已。最近辛西那鐵（Cincin　Nati）雖已建成五百基羅之强大電力播音臺，但其成績如何，頗屬疑問。</p>
<p>歐洲的情形，恰恰相反。蓋歐洲之中，各國昆連相接，國數旣多，距離又近，國際的播音戰自然頗形激烈，因之其播音臺，亦以甩强大電力者居多。例如蘇聯，播音臺所用電力中已有五百基羅者，其一百基羅以上者亦有約二十處；法國一百基羅之播音臺有六七所；意國亦建有五百基羅者以相競爭。故强大電力播音之競爭，在歐洲至爲激烈。</p>
<p>至於播音中之廣吿播音，以商業國之花旗爲盛；甚至設有專門招攬接洽此種無綫電播音廣吿之公司；在歐洲方面則反是，廣吿播音極少，甚至有全無者。</p>
<p>此外，尙有種種特殊播音臺，例如法京巴黎市外有一播音臺，專以播音適合英人胃口的音樂，而其收音者亦以住居英國的英人居多。又英美德意諸國，尙多特設有短波播音臺，用强烈的短波播音給各殖民地，以便他們帝國主義者之遂行其侵略政策。蓋歐美諸國的殖民地，大多離本國較遠，普通播音臺的播送不能見效，非以强烈的短波不可了。</p>
<h3>電工率及電工</h3>
<p>— 恩倫</p>
<p>電流具有一定的工作能力，電流所具作工的能力，便稱為電能（ElectricalEnergy）；電流所作的工，便稱爲電工；每秒鐘電流所做的工，便稱爲電工率。電工率P係等於電壓V（弗打）與電流I（安培）相乘的積，卽</p>
<p>P＝V……（1）</p>
<p>量電工率的單位爲　特（Watt，簡稱瓦，一瓦卽一安培的電流在I弗打電壓時的電工率。有時也用瓦的倍數以爲工率的較大單位如瓸，瓩等。</p>
<p>1瓸（Bectowatt）＝（100）瓦</p>
<p>1瓩（Kilowatt）＝100　瓦</p>
<p>由（1）式，電流I或電壓V也可以由電工　P求之，</p>
<p>歐姆定律表示電壓，電流，耗阻三者的關係，電工率的公式便表示工率，電流，電壓三者的關係。這兩種關係，都可以用一個圓周來表示，如圖A便表示歐姆定律，圖B便表示電工電率的定律。　（待續）</p>

<h3>中國酒精廠參觀記（續）</h3>
<p>— 黃幼雄</p>
<p>酒和酒精—酒精的用途—中國酒精之需要量</p>
<p>酒精之製造—全廠巡禮—對於未來的希望</p>
<p>（五）全廠巡禮</p>
<p>中國酒精廠，自備小汽船，來往上海白蓮涇之間，以接送辦專員及工友。該廠廠屋，全用鋼骨水門汀建築，屋頂平式，外觀極爲宏偉。工廠方面設化學機械及事務三處。化學處，機械處都設總工程師各一人，及助理管理員等若干人，事務處設中西文秘書及辦事員若干人，全廠機師工友總計不過百餘人，而廠基地面大至一百五十畝，然能管理週到，有條不紊，這固然是設備完全，一切工作都能利用機械之所致，但亦可見籌備設計時的煞費苦心了。</p>
<p>記者等由湯廠長親自領導先至化騐室，此室專可製造部分之廿學管　。其鄰爲培養室及殺菌室，則司酵母培養。原酵母爲製造酒精最重要之事物，酒精出品的好壞，與酵母關係極大。所以該廠極爲重視，酵母種類甚多，該室均用玻璃管分號貯藏，以便選用。其他應用原料，該廠所用各種原料亦須經小規模的試騐合格以後始爲大規模的製造。</p>
<p>次至發芽室，在平面屋頂，上蓋玻璃　，下爲發芽槽，室中應用最新式之冷氣機，雖大氣暖熱時，亦可製造麥芽，麥芽之用途，即爲總和穀類薯類原料中而使搪化者。</p>
<p>以榖類爲原料而製造酒精，則原料處理室極爲重要。該室備有除塵機，去殼機，篩殻機，磨碎機，這些雖都同平常鄉間所用的風車磨車等原理相同，可是因爲利用新式的機械，所以工作迅速，效率極大。且一切運輸概用袋式或螺旋式自動運輸機，無人力搬運之麻煩。</p>
<p>繼至蒸煮糖化室，該室即使毅類攙和麥芽以後，使其糖化，內備高壓蒸煮機，糖化機及冷却機等。以上各室爲使用穀類澱粉質原料製造酒精所不可少的設備，不久該廠即將着手製造，在記者參觀時，　　置多量的　鈴　貯有備用了。</p>
<p>以後所參觀者爲川糖蜜作原料之各種製造程序，該廠目前之酒精製造概用南洋輸人之搪蜜，糖蜜運至，先貯藏於廠門口之貯藏槽中，用時自動送至冲淡室，加水冲淡，並用濾過之壓縮空氣爲之攪拌，均勻。室內附置純粹酵，母培養器，備榖類醪及搪蜜醱酵之用。</p>
<p>酒精之製造，其主要工程，實在醱酵，該廠備有　製密閉酸酵槽十六個，每個容量計七</p>
<p>中國酒精廠全景</p>
<p>糖蜜貯藏槽六五〇公升。內設汽管，水管空氣管等，醱酵時即生酒精與炭酸氣體。其炭酸氣即從槽頂總管通入炭酸氣製造室以備製造乾氷及液體空氣之用。</p>
<p>記者在醃酵室，停留稍久，其時正在醱酵，揭開糟蓋，但見內部全是泡沫，呈淡黃色、而酒精氣味觸鼻。醱酵槽，並立成行，異常偉大，每槽各附表記，記明經過時間及其溫度，並有人時時觀察焉。</p>
<p>最後至蒸溜室，蒸溜機，爲英國伯萊爾公司所造，係運續式蒸溜精製及提淨機。魏工程師告訴我們，說，酒精蒸出時，有「酒頭」「酒尾」都須與製成品分離提淨。所謂酒頭，就是最初蒸出時的酒精，常含有低沸點的醛質，所謂酒尾，則是最後溜出時含有高沸點的雜醇酒，這些都須提淨，然後酒精乃能純良。此蒸出之酒精，則貯藏室外之貯藏塔中。</p>
<p>至此酒精製造工作已完，再下樓趨至裝罐室參觀，裝盛方法，概用自動管理，或以容量計，或以重量計，都很精密可靠。至該廠之酒精貯藏槽，計有　個，每個容量一百萬公升，約可貯藏二個月所出之製品。</p>
<p>除上述各室以外，該廠因各部機器之轉動，均需用電力，故自備四百基羅華特之發電機一座，可供全廠電動機及電燈之用。該廠又需要大量之水及水蒸汽，故又自鑿深七百尺之水井一口，每小時可出水一三·六五〇〇公升。蒸汽之供給，則自備水管式汽鍋兩座，其裝燃燒之煤與去燃後餘燼，亦均用機械爲之。</p>
<p>爲工廠安全計，該廠又備有防火用打水唧筒，以汽油機牽動，每分鐘能汲水四五五六公升，可將黃浦江之水通至全廠各部，藉防火患</p>
<p>參觀已畢，記者遂與湯廠長同攝一影，並道謝忱，即乘該廠自備汽船返館。魏林二君亦</p>
<p>母　粹培養器寓上海，復得同舟，舟中且得二君再爲解　廠中工作之程序，及一切設施，至可感也。</p>
<p>（六）對於未來的希望</p>
<p>中國酒精廠自籌辦迄今，不過二年，而產品之優，堪與舶來品相頡頏以中國目前需要酒精之迫切，實爲最有望之事業。記者等參觀一過，雖爲時甚暫，不及細細叨敎，但見其機械設備之完善，工作程序之精密，在目前我國工業界中，實不多觏。惟酒精爲化學工業之基本原料，可與酸鹼並重，一國工業愈發達，則酒精的需要量愈多，倘我國工業而日趨發展，則中國酒精廠今日之產量，恐猶不足以應付，而復待擴充，幸該廠原已早留餘地，擴充極易，此後我們所希望的，只在國人能知中國已有自製的酒精，一致愛用，才可免利權之外溢。</p>
<p>中國酒精廠目前所用原料，爲糖蜜，該廠現有穀類製酒精的設備，而穀類原料及馬鈴薯等，我國又到處均有出產，以後更希望積極發展，使原料亦全用國貨，則不特利權不至外溢，而農產品亦可因此而得一條出路。</p>
<p>最後，我國國內旣少液體燃料之產出，而液體燃料之需要則與日俱增，酒精可代汽油，各國旣有成績可證，但其配合成分尙有研究之餘地，我們又希望國人能起而提倡，研究之，則其於國防交　上之利益，尤非一言所能盡矣。　（完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（〇）（三）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我知道怎樣故的！哈先生常常用這個方法！不過因爲我以前沒有樟腦油，所以只用一隻別針，」唐恩說了以後，就輕輕注一滴在那昆蟲頭上，那一對湖色的翼翅震動了一晌便即歸於靜止了。這一點小小的宰殺尙未完了，忽然坦第從臥室中喊道，「啊，那些小鮮出來了，大的把它們吃完了。」（註）小橋和他的阿姨即去援救，只看見坦第在一個椅子上跳得甚爲興奮，同時有兩隻小蟹在地板上亂爬，它們已從籠子的鋼絲眼裏拚命逃出來了。另有一隻正在爬向籠子的頂上去，他的生命分明是受着極大的威脅，因爲下面正現出一番悲慘而復具奇趣的景象。那個大蟹退入到籠中一個小房子裏，即是以前博黎水杯所在的去處，安然坐着，吃他的一個同類，絲毫無所感動。那可憐的苦主一切爪鉗悉被拔去，身子已被顚倒，上殻被一鉗執住，切近大蟹的口，當爲一個碟千，於是他以另一隻鉗刳出那苦主的肉夷然吃着，有時將他一副奇怪而凸出的眼從一旁轉至另一旁，伸出一根細長的舌頭，去舐那一對眼睛，使小孩發出狂笑。蜀夫人將籠送入唐恩的房中，給他觀察那種奇景，同時小橋收集了那些游卒，關住他們在一個闔倒的洗手鉢盂裏。</p>

<h3>紗花　多頭獲利出籠　紗花午後突然下降　狂漲暴落殊屬驚人</h3>
<p>紗市兎起鶻落、局勢又現狂暴之狀、初因銀行界及公債帮又來拉進加碼、市塲人心惶惶、空氣異常緊張、良以一般投機商心思狂熱、對於棉紗竭力看漲、以存底枯涸、原棉高貴、故遠期猛力收買、後三個月創見打破十一月四月後之新紀錄、最高峰見二百〇八元九角、午後獲利者出籠、忽然下瀉矣、</p>
<p>遠月紗曾見新高價</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月稍平疲、微小三·四角、拍至遠月見昂、但塲中形勢尙堅、拍至二三盤、因原棉價向前進、檯面驟見緊張、買氣尤激、且後三個月漲風愈形劇烈、爲某大戶繼續購買、幷聞公債續上、人心更挺、遠月新高峰層出不窮、四月期迫近二百十元關口、收盤時長豐錦昌大孚一致出檔、市况略形疲萎、結果各月比七日收盤價均漲一元五·六·角至二元一角、惟本月份僅漲四角、午後開盤忽然下降、形勢大變、以上午獲利者大批出籠、致人心怠懈、賣氣轉熾、市盤步步下瀉、查三日中飛漲十元外、應有此反動也、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二元至三元三角、查賣出大孚四千一百包、大豐八百包、錦昌三千一百包、瑞大二千六百包、大昌成一千八百五十包、畏豐五千六百五十包、信誠六百包、同孚七百包、振大八百包、買進通肥一千八百五十包、明穗二千四百五十包、合興二千零五十包、元一五千一百包、泰昌一千四百包、大豐九百五十包、源大九百包、長餘八百包、仁豐一千三百包、信誠一千八百包、益昶五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥亦大漲小回</h3>
<p>午後隨紗花而回跌</p>
<p>粉市昨上午開盤、又呈高貴無已之態、因洋麥報價、芝加哥猛好五角至八角不等、坎拿大好五角零、人心本巳望高、有此助力、自然引起業內外之購買、聞江浙內地帮進意甚濃、尤以甬帮進胃更暢、故近期亦突一角大關、三四月份則衝出三元二角大關、均爲新紀錄、成交達六十餘萬包、漲度巳三四分、迨至下午開盤、初仍挺健、旋以花紗回跌甚猛、致大戶多頭因此而出檔、大廠亦有抽額較多而反出、是以人心頓平、回跌二三分、交易轉淸、祇做三十餘萬包云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤、洋麥報價漲五角至八角左右、業中人心思比較活躍、各月份之喊價、好三五分左右、市面步步提高、雖大部分並不看低、但以市値過昂、不免戒懼、故交易不暢、漲風亦覺淡薄、迨至下午開盤、各月份仍不甚旺、價呈盤旋、與上午相仿、觀前途如無洋麥救濟、難免有市無貨之感、現麥因客戶扳價、廠胃未貪、致無成交云、</p>
<p>海外小麥市需要擴大、此係國內外間市面與國外市面有力之反映、阿根廷作物受損、陳麥需要頗佳、傳加麥之出口需要增加、</p>

<h3>哀「菊」</h3>
<p>— （孟昭）</p>
<p>菊花之隱逸者也，傲霜獨立，不與凡卉爭妍，亮節淸風，人爭譽之。</p>
<p>然而予偶經繁華的街道，竟有「菊花平沽大賤賣」的標語。</p>
<p>步往賞覽一週，頗多燕瘦環肥，搖曳生姿的好花，標價四角·六角·一元·兩元，我不禁生名菊埋沒之感，而爲之悲哀。</p>
<p>菊，一經名士品題，便身價十倍，供養書齋；而一旦淪落於庸夫俗子之手，競利用它爲發財的工具，正好似小家碧玉，淪在妓寮中，被惡鴇虐待，更使伊站立街頭接客。世有淵明癖者，其亦與起而作護花使者耶？</p>
<h3>愛菊</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>蒔花原爲雅人韻事。我雖不曾有雅人的資格，然而却也歡喜這些玩藝兒的。所以人家常常說我這些也是雅人韻事，其實我自己旣不配稱雅人，更何來的韻事？並且我也並不是想學作雅人，這不過是我性之所好心之所愛而已</p>
<p>在我家天井裏就有兩個花藥壇，我除了覓取各式各樣的奇花異卉去移植其間外，更去找尋各種不容易習見的植物來種在裏面。</p>
<p>那車上的花，可謂四時不斷的。無論在每一個季候裏都有幾種花草可供玩賞。我平常所愛好的花有四種，一梅花，二蘭花，三荷花，四菊花，而其中尤以菊花爲最愛。現在我那天井裏就有十多種菊花種着，共有三十多盆，紅·黃·紫·藍·白·蓮·深淺和合搶色等均有。雖稱不得什麽名貴。然而却也可愛。因爲除了市上所有的「血滴子」，「金盤承露」，「鶴舞雲霄」，「夜來香」，「獅球」，「鳳尾」，「孔雀屏，」這幾種外，還有我自己用古詞的名稱所題的幾種。如：滿庭芳，柳色黃，桂枝香，靑衫濕，醉花陰，相見歡，東風第一枝，喜遷鶯，探春，蝶戀花，西江月等數種，均各按其色性及形態而定的。</p>
<p>我近兩年來却爲了職業關係的緣故，所以久已無暇親自栽培。祗好將一切責任委之於妻，因爲我妻乃是我愛花的一位忠實同志。</p>
<h3>吃菊</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>菊是高士，於是乎栽菊賞菊的，也遂都成爲雅人，會得對菊吟詩的，自然更是高雅得了不起。</p>
<p>普通說起了菊，似乎僅供高人雅士欣賞吟咏而已，殊不知菊花的花瓣兒，却是一種很好的食品。我的故鄉，是蘇州城外的一農村。雖然在我的故鄉，沒曾出過名士，也沒曾生過詩人，但全村三十餘家人家，却每家都種着半畦秋菊。我故鄉的栽菊，倒並非爲了欣賞，唯一目的，便是爲了吃。</p>
<p>最普通的吃法，是做菊花糕。先把盛開着的菊花的花瓣兒摘下來，洗淨之後，凉得半乾之後，和着桂花一同糖漬着，固封在瓶中，埋入地下，到下年三四月中，開出來，花瓣已被漬透，而同時呢，汁中已有很濃郁的菊花和桂花的混合香味了。用這種糖汁，和入粉中，用刻有菊花的印版，印成一塊一塊糕兒，儘不用加入儲子，蒸熟之後，已是淸香撲鼻的菊花糕了。雖然菊花糕之所以成名，究竟是爲了通常都用菊花版印呢，還是因爲用菊花滷的關係，果然是無從查考，反正這叫做菊花糕，是挺有意義的。若是要純菊花汁，那只須糖漬的時候，不和桂花和在一起就行了，不過其味也不及和桂花的馥郁，但淸香乃過之</p>
<p>蟹粉菊花鍋，也是我鄉的菊花食法之一，不過這是非有宴會不用的。先把蟹粉炒就了，於是把備就的肥碩的菊花瓣傾入。一壁傾入，一壁把鍋子離火，用敏捷的手法攪上二三攪就行了。蟹的鮮美，菊花的淸香，在酒已半酣的時候吃起來，眞有一種提神醒酒的好處。菊瓣的量，以蟹粉二比菊瓣一爲最滴當。蟹粉太多了，菊辦給蒸得過熟了，香味减色。菊辦過多了，會使吃的人舌上感到苦澀。在上海，我也曾在某酒中吃過所謂菊花鍋，但是是把疏疏的菊花瓣，漂在菜上的，那不過楚徒有其名而已，每人也只有十來絲上嘴，根本就嚼不出茶麽味兒來。</p>
<p>把菊花供人饕餮，這在雅士說來，或許有煮鶴焚琴之感，似乎是大煞風景，其實與其任令花開花謝，任人踐踏，倒還不如乘其綻開時採下來，修補修補五臟殿，來得有意思。因此特爲介紹，以供讀者一快朶頤。</p>
<h3>東籬佳色</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<h3>爲菊訟寃</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>菊種類最多，前人叫他為「節花的」，畢竟還有些意思；因他開在百卉凋零的當兒，做了一個羣芳隊裏的殿軍，像這種資格，不是令人要欽敬崇仰麽？就是看他經了嚴霜，飽受寒冷，還挺然獨立，和朔風撲戰，絲毫不肯示弱呢！所以菊開了許多顏色的花朶，而且都是十分美麗哼！你看，這時候有游蜂浪蝶去侵犯他麼？大家曉得是不會有的，那末，菊的品位，就比較其他的凡卉，眞要高出出幾倍哩！</p>
<p>然而一般愛菊的人們，偏拿菊來去象徵女子，不知道爲什麽道理？像「粉西施」，「嬌容變」，「醉太眞」，「換新妝」，這一類的名詞，倘要羅列起來，實在不少；到了現在，覔着了一種稀有的名菊，不管他楚怎樣的花品，喂！竟會拿「摩登」兩個字配上去，就叫它爲「摩登菊」；這豈不是辱沒了菊的志節，和三徑叢中遺傳下來榮譽麼？還不够，把菊當作像妓女般看待，當他盛開，拿來陳列在金迷紙醉的中間，酒氣和燈光逼着，使他朝晚薰灼，不到幾天，唉！花色變了，枝葉也漸漸地萎黃了，看到憔悴不堪的姿態，自然使人生厭，末了，就拋棄到牆邊壁角，誰也不會再去睬啊！你想，菊的身世，這樣可憐，吾眞代他抱了不平，借三寸筆桿兒來伸訴一下。</p>
<p>有什麽理由？菊最宜在荒村籬洛之間，那末他就有一種瀟洒出塵的丰致；旁如有淸流映帶，稻畦如雲，外則柴扉半掩，寧可和野老鄉農相親近，這就是菊的素願；卽使沒有知己的人來欣賞，他也很自在的餐霞飲露倒反可以留香晚節，雖凌霜冒雨，也足以自傲於人間吧！倘　不是，受了幾多磨折，把竹枝來綁，和麻綫來紮，像一個囚徒，日日處在獄窖裏過生活，菊正抱着滿肚的寃枉，要希望人家營救呢。</p>
<h3>日本的菊花展覽會（上）</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本的菊花本來也由我國傳入，種類雖不及我國現有的多，但是栽培方法，大有靑出於藍之勢。原因是日本不論對於什麽事情，總是抱着不知足的態度，精益求精的研究着。研究種菊的團體很多，最著名的有秋香會重九會長生會等，各地都有支會，會務很發達，每次展覧都以日比谷公園爲中心的。</p>
<p>我國人都知道櫻花是日本的國花，其實是錯的。櫻花不過是日本特有的花木，因爲顏色美麗，很得日人的歡心罷了。日本的國花乃是菊花。他們的勳章上常有黃色的菊花紋便楚國花的標幟。</p>
<p>日本以菊花的大小，分大中小三種。我國的粉荷麒麟角等花球較大的，屬於大菊。雲中嬌鳳，鶴舞雲零等花球較小的，列入中菊，其他如龍眼滿天星等是小菊了。日本對菊花的題名也和我國相同，各憑自己的意思，沒有一定。大約花瓣闊大的名之曰荷，球狀而花瓣圍簇的名曰厚物。花瓣呈管狀而成旋形的曰抱。花瓣則分管瓣匙瓣平瓣三種。批評標準分色，光澤，花體，花形，瓣質，品格，才，力，花梗，葉，及未來，十一類，凡得選入等第的，由會中分呈金盃銀盃將狀等，無不認爲無上光榮的。</p>
<p>日本種大菊中菊的姿態可分爲兩種，一種是普通的盆栽，一種即我國的紥景。紥景沒有一定的形勢，和我國相同。一棵菊花有幾百朶的花，紮成各種不同的形式，求其美觀整齊。盆栽的完全在欣賞品評，所以最爲考究。他們每一盆菊花，至少分三枝，成三角形，高低相同。我國名貴的菊花，常只有一枝獨立着，那裏是沒有。從小的時候，便把椏枝分爲三起，於楚盡力培養他長大。泥盆高尺餘徑七八寸。盆小則花瘦，這是我國藝菊者，必須將花盆解放的。花幹粗而高，在三尺以上，扶以紫竹，故枝幹挺直，絕無旁枝。葉肥而密，從根部到桿頂，是沒有一張脫落或焦黃的。我國施肥，大都只用糞尿，似覺不够，非用科學方法不可。施肥時候園丁常將肥料誤染根葉上，致根葉常因此焦脫，還有花盆低小，置地上，雨水賤泥土於葉上，沒其吸收養氣之細孔，亦易焦脫，所以花盆須高大，不必一定要置地上，得收地氣。菊喜陽光而怕日灸，故以入花棚爲宜。</p>
<p>看了日本的菊花，又覺得我國的菊花，是嬌弱而含有病態了。他們的菊花，三枝平均發達開花時間相同，無分軒輊。花冠肥大徑達六七寸，球狀者呈半球形，不若我國之扁而小。花瓣厚而肥，光澤亦佳。花下托以紙板或圓形鉛絲架子，使花瓣不致下墮而損其花姿，三枝以上者，排列亦有一定格式，大約成五角形或六角形爲最多。</p>
<h3>古猗園賞菊新開篇</h3>
<p>— 夢飛</p>
<p>大好園林號古猗，有名古蹟在槎溪，（即南翔）自從去歲新修葺，收拾得金碧輝煌景色宜。四季名花多異種，百年老樹世間稀，假山疊就仙人洞，巧妙玲瓏有上下梯。五老峯五個老人態，長短還分瘦與肥，九曲橋祇有橋三曲，坐看魚躍與鳶飛。鳳凰台，釣魚磯，竹枝山綠竹自漪漪。梅花廳畔梅花種，白鶴亭中白鶴棲。不繫舟一艘池邊泊，舟中點綴更精奇。所以是終年遊客如雲集，携手花前笑語低。到如今天淡雲閒秋色好，黃花滿眼色紛披，雪獅子，醉楊妃，麒麟帶，鳳凰衣，部是那異種新花盡出奇。他們是疊就花山成幾座，令人兒目醉與神迷，公開展覽無需券，訂定時間半月期。諒必是一輩淵明有癖者，定然連袂入園扉，共賞名花去品題。</p>
<p>文藝消息　藝聲第五期潘胡喜事特輯，因內容豐當，趣味濃厚，故銷行十分暢達，由上海雜誌公司及各報攤本外埠各書局共同推銷以來，業巳售去萬餘冊，嘗有一人購買七八冊分贈戚友者，存書無多，欲購須速。</p>
<h3>藝菊叢談</h3>
<p>— （影呆）</p>
<p>秋快要老去的時節，菊花又開放了，在花類之中，菊的品格，素爲詩人雅士所尊重；因此，到了菊花盛開的時節，各地人士，都有當菊之舉，單就上海一隅，各園林塲，各遊戲塲，又在忙開菊花會了。不渦菊花這樣東西，種植也不很容易，同樣的一株菊花，兩個人分種，菊本的形態，花朶的大小，會絕然不同，好壞要看種法而定。當此菊花開放期內，爲使春秋點綴起見，在這裏將就我個人所知，略述一些藝菊的方法於后：</p>
<p>挿條　挿條是最普遍的一種方法，上年的枯菊，要是根不去掉，到了淸明過後，根上便會發出芽來，成爲新菊。到了四五月，菊芽長大之後，我們便要摘下頭來，挿在泥土之中，不到幾天，便可生根而活起來的。種菊的人，大都採取這種方法。</p>
<p>老本　菊花的老本身，上年枯黃之後，過了春天，也會發茅。我們如果不去摘下，讓它生長，多加此肥料，將來可長得三四尺高，開的花有帽子一樣大。不過藝菊的同志，以老本身培殖大花，祗是偶然爲之，不會把所有菊花都如此種法的。</p>
<p>籽出　好多人知道菊花沒有籽，其實也是有的，碩大的花朶，枯黃而後，收得的花籽，第二年播在泥土中，也會發茅，而且開起花來，有時和本來的顏色，花瓣，完全不同，開得不好也是它，開得特別好也楚它，所謂新種，大半是籽出的，燕菊同志，每喜嘗試，以冀獲得新種。</p>
<p>施肥　要求菊花開放時，花朶硕大，那麽肥料的充足，也是不可忽略的，菊花的肥料，大致豆餅草汁等最好。開初應得種在地上，使其獲得地氣，到了開花的時候，才可連泥拔起，移在花盆裏面，要是老早就種在盆裏，那就不會十分肥壯的。</p>
<p>捕蟲　菊花在生長期內，除了天氣過早，要死亡之外，靑蟲也是一種大敵；所以我們在夏秋時節，每天早晚，要到菊圃中逐一檢視，發現了蟲傷，馬上把小蟲捉去，否則枝葉被傷，就不容易生長，甚而會死亡的。</p>
<p>摘頭　菊花不生長的時候，到了五六月，我們更要把頭摘去，這樣才能生出小頭，將來每個頭上有一朶花，你要幾朶花就留幾個頭，旁邊附着的小枝也要摘掉，不過一顆菊花，花朶以四五朶爲最佳，過於少不好看，過於多長不大，均非所宜。八九月間，花蕊初生時節，發現了旁枝附葉的上面，也有花蕊，應即除去，以免他日花多了難看，又是放不大。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>絲料缺乏被迫停車</h3>
<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>報載：「本市開工各絲廠，近因原料缺乏，無法繅製，故上月間已相繼停工達十六家，至本月底，恐將全部停工」。</p>
<p>「原料缺乏」的原因，據某絲業鉅子談：「年來因世界經濟不景氣，及日絲貶價傾鎖，致華絲一蹶不振，價格慘跌，江浙區蠶農，因無利可圖，紛紛改就他業。乃本年入夏以來，因日本產蠶區域，均遭水災，產品减少，而歐美需要增加，故銷路活躍，絲價步漲。」不過，一方面雖然「銷路活躍，絲價步漲」，而另一方面因爲「蠶農所育甚少，產量不豐」，所以雖然是「華絲外銷之大轉機」，而卒因「原料缺乏」，「被迫停車」。於是絲業界　對江浙建設廳要求應行注意二點：一、多發蠶種，本年度祇發改良種一百八十餘萬張，明年度全少須發六百萬張，始可產銷相符。二、培植桑林，年來蠶農因鑑絲價慘落，視育蠶爲畏途，對於所植桑樹，非惟不加培植，而且大事砍伐，因之蠶食不敷，發生恐慌。同時，在絲業界本身，也决定「改良技術」。</p>
<p>年來國絲業之一蹶不振，　原因，眞如某絲業鉅子所說的，是「因世界經濟不景氣，及日（日字普泛些說應改爲「外」字才對）絲貶價傾銷一，但是，何以人家可以貶價傾銷」的，而我們獨不能「貶」價呢？說起來，我們育蠶的歷史，又比人家爲長的。</p>
<p>這原因，說起來很簡單，我們的蠶農們，一切應用的全楚墨守陳法，不知道研究，不知道應用科學方法，因之結果就連蠶種都得向他們去買「改良種」，別的更可想見。不僅育蠶的方法上是如此，更甚的是他們是由政府帮助，採取集體的方法的，而我們，則依舊由各個蠶農憑着他們微薄的力量「各自為戰」。</p>
<p>由於經濟機構　　法上的不同，試問，其能不「被迫」「紛紛改就他業」，其可得乎？</p>
<p>再就本年度　「銷路活躍，絲價步漲」來說，這也是偶爾的得天時地利結果。所以對於絲業界希望江浙建設廳的二點，也就感到太渺茫，蠶種由一百八十餘萬張增至六百萬張，這在桑葉的供給上是否發生問題日慢談它，而六百萬張的蠶種的結果，會不會積囤難銷是應該首先顧慮到的，不久之前，我們不是親看到過怕繭子出飛蛾和出不起棧租的新聞過？至於第二點，那楚隨「市價增落」而來的，如果出產有把握，那不必要建設應注意，蠶農們自己就會快快的使它一恢復舊觀的，不然，隨便建設廳如何注意，他們旣「紛紛改就　業，」對於毫無用處的桑樹，自然要「大事砍伐」了。</p>
<p>目前，最先决的問題是如何和人家在世界市塲上競爭，別的枝枝節節的問題，是都得看先决問題如何才能决定的。</p>
<h3>瘋人</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>陽光已爬過了窗縫，偸偸的掛在給白色的灰壁上，映着幾縷紫紅色的綫條，綜錯地，靜寂地。</p>
<p>馬家寡婦的掛鐘已經響過七下了，媳婦王汪老早已在灶間內敲東擊西的忙碌着，嘴裏喃喃的，囈語也似地咒駡着，照例從天氣詛咒起，小貓兒不乖巧，夜裏沒好睡，直到婆婆什念，丈夫貪吃懶做止，絮絮叨叨的一大堆，好像對誰訴說似的：於是稻草翻動聲，劃自來火聲，接着是必必剝剝的火熖聲。</p>
<p>照着常例，這時學生已經大半背着書包，站在荔枝樹下，大聲叫道：</p>
<p>「林先生，日頭晒着屁股了！」</p>
<p>但是現在是過了七點，雖楚寒冷天氣，出了個好太陽也孩是……而荔枝樹</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>下還楚那麽靜悄悄的。</p>
<p>突然從村角揚過了一陣喧叫，笑，喊，叫，駡洋溢成一團的，而這嘈聲却又越來得近，淸楚而又洪大的。我心裏疑訝着，便爬起來附着窗縫看出去。只見六角墻上滿滿的擠着人，一個光頭敞胸的靑年農民，瘋瘋顚顚的在前頭跑着，手裏高揚着一把筒笛，大聲喊駡，眼睛流着淚，用着沙嗓子叫：</p>
<p>「評理嗎？好！找林先生去！」</p>
<p>背後跟住一大羣人，村學校的學生，老人，小孩和幾個好事的婦人，他們隔得遠遠的，大聲笑，喊和吆喝：「瘋子」但當他站住脚向他們揚手時，大家却都忙着往後退，亂跑亂竄的。</p>
<p>他們簇擁着向我住的地方來。馬家媳婦從灶間慌慌張張的，跑上更樓來向我說；「林先生瘋子歪頭打着門，强要見你哩！」</p>
<p>外面敲門聲砰砰的響着，瘋子歪頭帶着嗚咽的尖聲嘯着：</p>
<p>「林先生！林先生，我要見林先生！」</p>
<p>接着又是一大陣羣衆的暄叫和吶笑。我於是便披好衣服出去。門開了，羣衆便起了一陣熱烈的哄叫。瘋子歪頭，滿抱着委曲的站在我底面前，他底眼睛燜熌的浮動着淚光，指着了同住他底人哀聲的喃道：</p>
<p>「林先生請你評評理，他們欺侮了我，說要偸去我底筒笛。」</p>
<p>我知道他今天瘋性又起了，對於瘋子們是不能違抝的，因此便假裝着發怒的神氣，圓睜着眼睛向村學生喝道：</p>
<p>「你們爲什麽欺侮他？這是什麽時候了，還不好好的替我到學校裏去！於是學生便都胆怯地悄然的散了，那些擠着揍熱鬧的，由於過去的經騐，知道瘋子找先生評理後，便再也沒有什麽特出或新奇的戲好看，於是也都三三五五的溜走。末了只剩下我和他。</p>
<p>我們坐在荔枝樹根上去晒太陽，歪頭仍舊是那麽頹喪的垂着頭，好像　底靈魂已不附在身上了。</p>
<p>好幾全月前誰還不豎起大姆指稱許他爲「典型」的農民哩！純樸而又誠實，但是現在却楚一個瘋子了。十五歲的那一年，他死去了爸，家裏的哥哥便把他送到外村一個親戚家去帮工，平和地把日子消磨在工作裏，到現在已有七八年了。在這七八年沒代價的勞動中，他曾取得親戚家的允許，願把一個表妹配給他。但是前幾個月他被派到外縣去買蔗種，回到家來時却發覺表妹被偷偸的嫁給鄰村的一個農民了。他雖心痛，但沒曾說過什麼言語，只是偸偸地流着淚，而且什麽事也不想幹，食量非常少，晚上也沒過好好睡覺，只楚幽靈也似的夾住一把筒笛，自言自語的在黑暗中摸索到表妹的夫家去；於是坐在對過的田塍上幽幽咽咽的把筒笛吹着，嘆息而且哀號，整夜整夜地。……</p>
<p>但是在一天晚上，他受了痛打了，因爲表妹的夫家發現他們新討來的老婆，受了澈夜笛聲的擾亂而感到不安寗。從此他便發了瘋，而重新投進這已離別了七八年家村的懷抱中來。現在他已是瘋子歪頭了。</p>
<p>我們都沉浸在回憶的陶醉中，一會他深深的嘆息了聲，便不知不覺哀哀的哭起來。</p>
<p>你爲什麽哭？」我疑訝地問。</p>
<p>「哭？他睜大了眼睛吃驚的向我看着，於是又嗚咽着「人家都來欺侮我啊！」站起來，便長揚地望槐花脚去。</p>
<p>不久，在這柔和的空氣中，便從遠遠蕩漾來了陣笛聲。</p>
<h3>水上花</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>溫柔的夜，罩在星子熠熠的深墨色的天空中。載滿巧緻的艇子的江面，也載滿歌絃的繁音，柔和的笑話，也載滿幽情的低訴，溶解在熱鬧的空間，薄薄地散開去，浮漾在明朗的江面上。</p>
<p>樹林樣的艇子射出燦爛的燈花，投映着無數的窗影的水面，閃耀着艷麗的波光，水在不大的風里起伏，輕輕地拍着船絃，發出韻味的回音；退回去，又　吻着江岸，撞噴着一串串的白的浪花</p>
<p>江岸那兒：高層建築物的半透明的輪廓倨傲地挿在半空中，電車叮咚地，長蛇陣似的來往馳駛着。</p>
<p>車子裝來了各樣的遊客，江邊起一陣小小的騷亂，大工站在船板上招着手：</p>
<p>「老爺，這邊坐，到等一號艇子的麽？」</p>
<p>「老爺，這邊坐，到第一號艇子的麼？」</p>
<p>有的跳上岸兜攬生意了。</p>
<p>於是船子載了遊客向江心的艇區游去。</p>
<p>這時候，每隻艇子的窗口上，扮着花朶似的姑娘們都探出腦袋，臉上掛着一截嫣然的誘惑的笑。用着紅色的，綠色的小手絹在揮着。</p>
<p>船子漸漸靠近了。</p>
<p>「先生，里邊有着最好的香茗，請上來玩玩吧！」</p>
<p>「先生，里邊有着最好的香茗，請上來玩玩吧！」</p>
<p>是那麽淸亮而婉囀的嗓子交雜地響着。</p>
<p>紊亂了一下，平靜着，接着是發出划漿，潑水的嘩啦嘩啦的聲饗，許多艇子各自駛開去，和着更動人的歌唱，暸喨的弦音，和着買賣的歡情。</p>
<p>江面露出一大片江水，躺在月光下</p>
<p>船子從江岸裝滿江上的人，運到艇子上邊，又空着船回去，不一下又裝滿了人。那樣穿梭般她奔忙着。隨着船子送往的繁密，姑娘們也有着繁密的生意，接了新的，送出舊的。姑娘們的感覺里倥惚地鑲着一些熟爛者陌生的臉眼。把自己的嘴唇印到每個遊客的嘴唇，身子倒進每個遊客的胸脯。到了深夜，遊客空了口袋，帶着醺醺的醉意，夢似的搭了船子上岸。於是姑娘們的皮夾却飽滿起來，腦袋打商口探出，遠遠地說着</p>
<p>「明兒請早來呀？」另後嘻嘻地笑。</p>
<p>東方漸漸露出魚肚色，游散去的艇子絡續集回到原地方。歌聲弦音才稀落，江面上嘈雜的情景頓然寂靜了。只有幾家暗班的艇子亮着燈。</p>
<p>這江上的艇子，雖然楚那末多，但游艇的人們却更多。姑娘們自家兒都有熟客，是常川的主顧，此外還有偶然乘興而來的。所以姑娘們並不愁沒人光臨，倒怕迎接不暇。尤其是在燠熱的夏季，江上的夜風是凉爽的，空氣是清新的，坐者艇了，載一船的月色，弦聲，聆着姑娘音樂似的醉人的歌。浮在江面上，彷彿夢境啊！因此游艇的人格外地多，只消黃昏後，遊客便三三五五的跑來，接客的船子一直忙到午夜，遲來點都有錢雇不着艇子的。</p>
<p>夏季是姑娘們挺愉快挺盼望不着的時節。</p>
<p>那時候，榮盛的時候，游艇費最高的要五塊錢，項便宜的也得一雙銀子。度夜資是史加苛刻了。帶上岸也可以的，花費自然越多，不過這情形很少見，因爲游湖是爲着湖上的風光。</p>
<p>然而儘管這樣，遊客却不曾闌珊。</p>
<p>日子過了一大串，姑娘們依樣　在水上，水上依樣有着歌弦的繁音，可是是那麽幽抑的，可是已沒有柔和的笑語，只是空船載着悲怨。</p>
<p>水上的榮盛隨着水流去了。</p>
<p>姑娘們照舊扮得花朶似的，獨少去鑑賞的對象，照舊倚在窗口凝視，却是擺着凄然的顔色。</p>
<p>接客的小船子也閒着落慌。</p>
<p>爲什麽遊客突的零落到可怕呢？也許她們不解。張望了半天，靜靜的江面聽不見一些聲息。隔了半天看見船子裝着人搖過來，勉强有一陣騷亂，但是那麼幾個人，這麽多的艇子。有什麽用。兌且如今來的全是先有目的熟客搶也搶不來的。</p>
<p>於是有更沉重的太息飛出江面。</p>
<p>姑娘們失去了嘻嘻的笑臉，愉快代替了悲哀，歌弦已經漸漸冷落，而變成苦訴以的。</p>
<p>憂鬱的暗影，凄凉的日子，花朶似的姑娘們漸漸憔悴了。浮在水面的艇子，一天天少下去了。廉外雨潺潺，春意闌珊，羅衾不耐五更寒，夢里不知身是客，一嚮貪歡！</p>

<h3>歌曲介紹</h3>
<p>漂泊者</p>
<p>簾外雨潺潺，春意闌珊，羅衾不耐五更寒，夢里不知身是客，一嚮貪歡！</p>
<p>故國已不堪回首，殘生已無地居留。漂流奔走，何處覓愛侶情儔！有時候，無聊難受，管什麽金盡床頭，目賞賞牆花路柳！如今壯志難酬，聊近婦人醇酒。休！休！休！酒澆愁，愁更愁，高聲吼，淚</p>

<p>— 江敉作</p>
<p>今天她們的音調總是那麼的不能諧和，引起了她們無限的恐慌，因爲這樂器能吿訴她世界未來的變化。女神們楚萬分憂慮，爲着這不祥的預兆，怕在這個宇宙之中，又有什麼浩刦要再。</p>

<p>空流！</p>
<p>勞動時露宿風餐，休息時隨遇而安；秦樓楚館，無非楚做假裝憨；每逢到酒闌人散，只剩些慚愧愁煩，且不免心灰意懶，如今困苦艱難，尤應臥薪嘗膽。幹！幹！幹淚不乾，血不乾，歌聲慘，劍光寒；獨自莫憑攔，無限關懷。別時容易見時難，流水落花，春夫也，天上人間！</p>

<p>夏荷生三笑</p>
<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「思鄉」</p>
<p>天涯遊子未還鄉。異地棲遲曙自傷。想我是，籬下依人身碌碌。客中烽火意皇皇。飄零河海知音少。最難堪是，我馬河山世業荒。非楚我，貪戀繁華新景物。敢忘那，烟霞淸靜舊家鄉。致使那，憑樓恨溢黃顏婦。倚閭愁添白髪娘。雖則是，戲彩愧非萊孝子，豈肯盡眉羞作薄情郎。音疎原爲性情懶。書少多因事故忙。到如今是，臘盡春回夜漸斷。我是孤燈愁湧恨初長。忍看歲月隨流水。空負年華遂駒光。正是寂寞窮齋悲寂寞。凄凉孤館感凄凉。愁聽那，雁聲嗚咽風聲急。月色迷離夜色蒼。祇有那，松蓋重重留晚翠。梅花片片透淸香。眞楚，三更燈火兩行淚。一片鄉心百結腸。恨的是，好夢未圓驚陋拚。且喜那，佳音初至報安康。但楚我，行期尙難書時日。樂叙天倫，尤須引領望。未免與歲月悠悠感慨長。</p>
<p>邢瑞亭鈫頭鳳</p>
<p>惠靈（一三八〇）下午九時至十時</p>
<p>開篇「八仙义麻雀」</p>
<p>十洲三島小蓬萊。縹緲仙鄉遠隔凡。怪獸珍禽隨處是。奇花異草滿嚴山。有一天，蓬萊島上馨音鬧。就見那，八洞神仙到此頑。那李鐵拐，拐杖一根拿了走。行來跛足步蹣跚。那漢鍾離，挺胸突肚腰圍闊。蒲扇忙搖狀似獃。那呂洞賓，斬妖　劍肩頭挿。道骨仙風確不凡。那張果老，倒騎驢子逍遙慣。白髪蕭蕭健未衰。那藍彩和，一種風流瀟灑樣。手中常執一花籃。那何仙姑，摩登服飾新裝着。嫋嫋婷婷秀色餐。那韓湘子，玉笛一枝隨口奏。那曹國舅，規行矩步後跟來。園中坐定香茶飲。鐵拐道，解悶無妨共手談。國舅鍾離齊道好。張果老，贊成拍掌似轟雷。四人入局多歡喜。义畢四圈坐位扳。鐵拐道，南風拍出西風降。再有，索子還加暗發財。鍾離是，索子完成淸一色。原來他也是大三翻。國舅的，坐着北風剛正碰。中風白板又加抬。他們是，若來九素都和出。急得莊家左右難。然而那今朝果老眞交運。自摸了九索一張攤下來。十二和一副最低牌。他連聲狂笑心中樂。三人是，喪氣垂頭口不開。仙人的一塲雀戰興闌珊。</p>

<h3>「雛燕啼痕」明日公映</h3>
<p>自「頑皮小姐」一片問世後，童星金蕙漱之名，於是轟動全球，竟成爲秀蘭鄧波兒之勁敵，現在，她的新作「雛燕啼痕」This　is　The　Life，已定於明日（星期日）起，公映於大光明。金蕙漱在本片中，飾一無父無母之孤雛，不幸落於壞徒手中，敎以歌舞技藝，迫伊登台表演，以供彼輩之揮耗。孤雛之名聲，雖由於演技之猛晋而哄傳遐邇，但伊究爲一天眞爛漫之女孩，徒擁虛名，未能獲得天性之愛，中心之痛苦，自非言語所能形容，我等在銀幕上，不但可以欣享金蕙漱主幹之偉大歌舞塲面，而伊之悲歡喜怒之演技，更足扣人心弦云。</p>

<h3>山海大理石廠</h3>
<p>現代建築。美觀是尙。於是飾面工程。遂爲人所重視。關於飾面工程所用之物料。若水泥。人造石。及磁料等。種類頗多。惟其中最有價値。抑且最爲人所歡迎者。厥爲大理石。蓋以其光滑勻凈。質堅耐久。具有天然彩紋。極富麗美觀之至。用以飾面。旣極宏偉壯麗。且殊經濟合算。綠其一經裝置。彌經久用。固非如普通飾面料之遭風雨剝蝕。易致損壞也。惟其有此種之優點。大理石之需要。乃隨時代之進展。而日見其殷亟。山海大理石廠。爲我國規模最大之石廠。廠址設南市斜土路魯班路口。創辦多年。經理爲雲間蘇光明君。經營有方。蒸蒸日上。該廠初以國產雲石。謀與舶來品競爭。旋以雲石原料不甚巨大。且色澤未能調和。不合於建築工程之用。乃直接向意比諸邦。定購各種顏色大塊石料。由該廠自行鋸開磨光。而至極工細之彫刻。以臻於美輪美奐之建築。今之江浙大厦全部大理石工程。都爲該廠所承辦。該廠過去承辦之中國墾業銀行。福源銀行等。工程石料。皆有良好成績。按該廠占地五畝餘。裝機器三十具。種種設備。無不盡善盡美。特聘有專家監製。每月可出磨光片料二萬平方英尺云。</p>
<h3>保管庫內形</h3>
<h3>住宅的門與垣</h3>
<p>— 橫由磐著陳茵譯</p>
<p>近來關於住宅與庭園一般地多少被注目了，可是，對於顯現住宅的外觀的左右，在住宅給予最初的印象的門與垣的論計，比較的無關心的人還很多。</p>
<p>通行街路的行人或來訪的客人最先注目的可說是門與垣，依此二者的設計如何亦可明白其家的主人乃至家族的趣昧，品格。有些住宅雖是很壯觀的，內部的裝飾很巧妙的，可是，若給予不快的第一印象，則對其家或庭園當有所不滿。</p>
<p>然而，若爲此而奢侈的費了不相應的費用專講修飾，亦在所不必要。美國及英國等的郊外住宅，田園都市全然沒有特造的門和垣，而自由地公開庭園的一部者有之。又建設此等，第一必須注意外觀卽可自由地從庭園的外部眺望那樣低的生垣或者單用柵籬，唯以標示境界的程度爲止。</p>
<p>與此相反的，卽從來日本的門與垣常是犧牲外觀的，從外部不能見透的不能侵入的那樣地造着閉鎖的高高的塀，圖以專爲邸內的平和獨占。雖在今日，尙有在混凝土摒之頂埋以玻璃的破片或五十釘。此亦是屢見之常事也。然而，此等雖爲防備侵入者之用，可是，外觀之美卻全失。</p>
<p>在今日建築漸漸的被改良，洋式建築日甚一日，故此當感爲最早時代的錯誤。</p>

Review opinion: This group believes that this case is very important. The original proposal only provided principles and there are still areas that need to be supplemented. After reviewing the past resolutions of the central government on local self-government and the local self-government laws and regulations promulgated by the government, and integrating the main points of the original proposal and the relevant local self-government proposals of this Congress, we drafted another proposal for "earnestly promoting local self-government to complete the period of political tutelage". Regarding the above review opinions, whether they are appropriate is subject to public decision. The resolution was revised and passed according to the review opinions. (2) The Resolution Drafting Committee presented resolutions on the political report and the military report. The original text is as follows: After listening to the political report and military report of the National Government, it is deeply felt that what the country has encountered in these four years is a hardship unprecedented in history. During this period of internal and external troubles, the National Government has been able to examine the revolutionary environment, adhere to the spirit of perseverance, and take all measures with the aim of ensuring the permanent survival of the country and the nation, and to advocate that the people work together in the face of difficulties. Its effects are clearly demonstrated in facts, such as the rapid progress of railway, telegraph, and highway transportation construction, the gradual completion of the initial procedures for developing the national economy, and the gradual realization of the plan for universal education, all of which are in line with the goal of developing national strength and enriching people's strength. In terms of military affairs, it has led the soldiers of the country with the spirit of loyalty, courage and sacrifice, devoted itself to defending the country and suppressing bandits in various battles, and has made continuous efforts in the renovation of military administration and the reform of the military system. In particular, it has completed the education of various arms, popularized the spiritual training of officers and soldiers, and promoted national military education with the most effort and is most able to meet the needs of the country. All facilities are based on the understanding of the primary and secondary importance. This conference believes that it is appropriate and should be accepted. However, our country is a country that has been weak and depleted for a long time, and it is in an era of drastic changes in the international situation. If we do not catch up quickly, we will eventually be left behind. The National Government should continue its past proactive spirit and make more concrete and vigorous efforts to build a modern country. In administration, it should strive to increase efficiency. In construction, it should strive to promote quantity and quality. Civil servants should strictly abide by performance evaluations as an effective driving force, so that they can achieve success day by day. In addition to the actual training, concentration, and use of people's strength and material resources, it is necessary to make every effort to cultivate and save them in order to enrich the foundation of the country. In terms of military affairs, it is hoped that the remaining red bandits will be eradicated and the army will be actively reorganized. For military construction, it is hoped that it will be able to meet the progress of all national construction and strive to complete modern equipment. For military education, advanced academics should have more opportunities for in-depth study. At the same time, the previous regulations should be continued to promote spiritual training and vocational training for officers and soldiers, and national military education should be implemented in schools and among the people. It will not only create soldiers who can be models for good citizens, but also create people who are the foundation of good soldiers, so that the atmosphere of vigor and integrity, and the knowledge and ability to defend the country and defend themselves can be popularized throughout the country, as a guarantee for the country's survival and development. We must deeply understand the ancient訓 of revitalizing the country in times of adversity, and we must help it with the hard work of 生聚敎訓. This is especially what we hope will urge the people of the country and the political and military authorities to work together. The resolution was passed. (3) The Central Executive Committee proposed to retroactively restore the party membership list of 64 people including Li Weirou: Li Weirou, Gao Faming, Wu Lanxi, Hu Jie, Zhang Rongchun, Ji Xianglin, Zhang Xin'an, Niu Yuqing, Wang Kejue, Lian Yinong, Ma Fangchen, Wang Hongchen, Huang Mian, Liu Houwu, Wu Deling, Zhang Yutian, Lin Yuncong, Liu Xuguang, Liang Minsun, Jiang Tianbo, Lu Ziduan, Wang Xinhao, Sun Xiaofeng, Li E, Lu Jun, Tan Jidao, Yang Fang, Cao Mo, Su Xingbo, Xu Jue, Luo Bao'an, Zhu Qifang, Luo Lesan, Chen Mengyu, Yan Renxia, Jiang Weisheng, Zeng Zhaolin, Huang Hunxing, Zhang Xueji, Huang Bingxin, Feng Ziyou, Zou Shixi, Zheng Guozong, Gao Xuelian, Xu Zhaonan, Liang Kaijia, Gao Ersong, Gao Erbai, Liu Xianwen, Chen Chao, Zhu Yucai, Hua Yizeng, Zhou Lianqing, Yin Gongwu, Chen Xiang, Feng Xuchang, Peng Yanli, Tan Fusheng, Qian Hongjie, Chen Gemin, Tian Wenchao, Xie Zi'an, Wang Yuzhang, Chen Zanyao. The retroactive recognition was resolved. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Elected 208 Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth National Congress held its seventh session at 2:00 PM on the 22nd to elect the Fifth Central Committee. A total of 515 Central Committee members and representatives attended, and 75 alternate Central Committee members and representatives attended as observers. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting. After the meeting began, Secretary-General Ye Chucang reported on the main points of the election method and the matters needing attention, and announced the list of ballot supervisors. Immediately, 515 ballots were distributed. The ballots were printed in advance, listing the names of 359 candidates, and stamped with the Congress seal to show caution. Anyone with voting rights was issued two papers, one to elect executive members and one to elect supervisory members. Voters only need to circle the names of the candidates they wish to elect on the list. Each person can elect 150 executive members and 58 supervisory members. After circling, sign and seal, and put them into the ballot box. It was completed at 5:50 PM. Immediately, the Presidium and ballot supervisors supervised the opening of the ballot box, dividing the 515 ballots into nine groups to count the votes. When counting the votes, each group was supervised by eight ballot supervisors, and two staff members from the Secretariat read the ballots and six people recorded the votes. Because there were too many ballots and candidates' names, it was estimated that it would not be completed and announced until midnight. The list of Central Committee members for this session, those elected today are 100 executive members, 50 alternate executive members, 40 supervisory members, and 18 alternate supervisory members, a total of 208 people. Those with more votes are the official members, and those with the next most votes are the alternate members. There are still 20 executive members, 10 alternate executive members, 10 supervisory members, and 12 alternate supervisory members, a total of 52 people. The Presidium will select 60 people from the 151 candidates who failed to be elected today and hold another election on the morning of the 23rd. On the morning of the 23rd, the General Assembly will also pass the General Assembly declaration and hold a closing ceremony in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Promote Local Self-Government in Areas Other Than Areas Affected by the Communist Suppression</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Because there were still important cases to be discussed, the Fifth National Congress changed the Central Committee election to 2:00 PM on the 22nd. The Fifth National Congress passed the proposal to earnestly promote local self-government to complete the period of political tutelage at the sixth session on the morning of the 22nd. The original text of the proposal is as follows: During the period of political tutelage, the main task is to promote local self-government. The revolution is an extraordinary destruction and must be followed by an extraordinary construction. Therefore, the Prime Minister said, "Self-government is the foundation of the Republic of China. When the foundation is solid, the country is solid." Also, in the preface to the Outline of National Reconstruction, he said, "The purpose of the period of political tutelage is to guide the people to engage in revolutionary construction, starting with county self-government as a unit. Within a county, efforts should be made to eliminate the old and establish the new to deeply plant the basic rights of the people, and then expand it to the province. In this way, the so-called self-government is the true self-government of the people, which is different from the false name of self-government to carry out its separatist activities. When local self-government is completed, the national organization will be complete, and the people can participate in national politics based on their local political training." Therefore, the Third National Congress, in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, based on the Outline of National Reconstruction, passed a resolution to "determine the strategy and procedures for local self-government to establish the foundation for political construction". In the same year, the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee also passed a resolution to "complete the county self-government case". The progress procedures are also divided into phases and are limited to be completed by the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The government should, based on this principle, formulate an implementation plan for completing county self-government from the start of the tutelage government and a progress schedule for each year to be used as implementation steps. In order to adapt to local needs, there are also various outlines for improving county and city local self-government methods and the formulation of principles for improving local self-government. At the same time, regarding self-government laws and regulations, such as the County Organization Law, the Implementation Law of the County Organization Law, the Implementation Law of District Self-Government, the Implementation Law of Township Self-Government, the election and recall law for township and village self-government officials, the County Council Organization Law, the County Council Member Election Law, etc., were all enacted by the Legislative Yuan between the 18th and 21st years of the Republic of China and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. If they can be implemented one by one, they will naturally achieve considerable results. Looking back at past achievements, among the 1,900 counties in the country, at the end of this period of political tutelage, it is still impossible to find one that has reached the level of self-government in the Outline of National Reconstruction and can become a completely self-governing county. Not to mention completing the entire local self-government work. The reasons for this are due to environmental constraints, and the following two points are also the root causes: 1. The government only focuses on written responses and ignores actual work. It often uses the relationship of suppressing bandits or the lack of economic resources as an excuse to perfunctorily carry out official duties. There is only the name of self-government, but no reality of self-government. 2. Local party and government authorities often lack close contact. The party department wants to promote it but cannot. For example, in the past, the central government had an organization called the Local Self-Government Promotion Association, which ordered party departments in various places to set up branches to assist the government in promoting self-government. However, local governments did not participate in cooperation in the active aspect, and used the excuse of financial difficulties in the passive aspect, taking a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the organization disintegrated invisibly and achieved nothing. From this point alone, it is clear that the failure of local party and government authorities to establish close contact has greatly affected the future of self-government. The above two shortcomings are due to the loss of the true "spirit of Party rule" in the driving force for promoting self-government. The so-called spirit of Party rule does not only mean issuing orders in accordance with the provisions of the Party program, but must be promoted by the Party and led by Party members. In other words, we must change government-run self-government to people-run self-government, and change ten inferior self-governments to revolutionary self-government. Only then can true local self-government be thoroughly realized. Now that the work of political tutelage is urgently awaiting completion, the promotion of local self-government cannot be delayed. Based on the above judgments, according to the Party program and previous resolutions, and with reference to actual needs, the methods are formulated as follows: 1. The General Assembly should decide that local self-government in all parts of the country should be completed quickly within a limited time (except for areas suppressing bandits and areas with special circumstances, but it must be reported for approval within one month of receiving the order) and submitted to the National Government for compliance. Those who do not comply will be punished for dereliction of duty. 2. The Central Party Department should establish a Local Self-Government Planning Committee as a national local self-government design and inspection agency, and may send personnel to various self-government promotion areas at any time to inspect and guide them. It should be established within one month. The following committees should be set up to be in charge of their respective affairs: (A) Organization Committee, responsible for matters related to the organization and guidance of county organizations, district self-government organizations, village self-government organizations, village councils, etc.; (B) Public Training Committee, responsible for matters related to the exercise of four powers by village self-government officials and public education; (C) Rural Production Committee, responsible for matters related to improving production, food management, transportation, trade, etc.; (D) Baojia Committee, including guidance on local defense matters; (E) Cooperation Committee, responsible for matters related to agricultural cooperation, industrial cooperation, trade cooperation, banking cooperation, insurance cooperation, etc.; (F) Household Committee, responsible for investigating and guiding household registration; (G) Land Committee, responsible for land surveying and determining land prices. 3. Each province should set up a Local Self-Government Branch, which should be organized jointly by the local party and government authorities, and under the guidance of the Central Local Self-Government Planning Committee, should be a local local self-government design and inspection agency. Internal staff should be transferred from the party department and the government to save expenses. The party department should specialize in design, review, and supervision to ensure thorough implementation. The government, in addition to jointly designing, should specialize in implementation. The internal organization may also be divided into organization, public training, rural production, Baojia, cooperation, household registration, land and other groups, so as to divide labor and cooperate, establish close contact, and jointly plan the completion of local self-government. 4. Local self-government should strive to fulfill the mission of education, upbringing, and defense, and should first establish the Baojia organization, which should be completed within the first half of the 25th year of the Republic of China (most provinces have already organized Baojia, so this deadline, although tight, is not difficult). It should be used to help stabilize society and revitalize the countryside. 5. Local self-government funds should be allocated separately from county taxes according to local financial conditions, and the provincial government should also provide appropriate subsidies from provincial tax revenues, so as to ensure that there is no shortage of funds. The tax revenues that have been allocated for local self-government, whether owned by the county or the province, should not be diverted to ensure the independence of self-government funds. 6. It is determined that promoting local self-government is the main task of party departments in all provinces and cities. The training of party members and the assessment of party member work should be based on local self-government as the main items. For civil affairs movement, also</p>

<h3>Anti-British Movement in Egypt</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Since the tension between England and Italy, Egypt has consistently adopted a cooperative and friendly attitude towards England. However, judging from the recent events of the past week, England's position in Egypt has undergone significant fluctuations. This is truly an unexpected development and deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Although Egypt is not economically important to England, its geographical location makes it the key to the rise and fall of the British Empire. Therefore, Napoleon once said, "To strike at England's throat, one must first control Egypt." After the opening of the Suez Canal, Egypt's position became the linchpin of England's transportation lines. If this place were occupied by another powerful country, it would be enough to hasten the collapse of the British Empire. Even the complete independence of Egypt would not be in England's interest. Therefore, after the Great War, the Egyptian Nationalist Party repeatedly demanded complete independence and even sent representatives to the Paris Peace Conference, but they were all blocked by England. Their representatives were even detained by the British. Even when England declared the abandonment of Egypt as a protectorate in 1922, it still had to retain the following conditions: (1) That England, at any time, enjoys a special status in Egypt, and Egyptian diplomacy must have close contact with the British High Commissioner in Egypt. (2) The Egyptian government must not conclude political treaties with any foreign country without the permission of the British government. Even if it wants to establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries, it must be assisted by the British government. (3) The British government is responsible for protecting the legitimate interests of foreigners in Egypt. (4) The British government has the responsibility to help Egypt defend its territory and maintain imperial transportation. For the sake of this responsibility, British troops may pass through Egyptian territory or station troops there at any time. (5) Egyptian troops and government agencies shall not hire foreign military instructors and government advisors without the consent of the British High Commissioner in Egypt. At the same time, no foreign debt may be raised without the consent of the British Financial Commissioner in Egypt. Judging from these points, although England has granted Egypt independence, it still imposes a certain degree of control over diplomatic and national defense issues. It does not allow Egypt to be completely independent, nor does it want other powerful countries to interfere. Therefore, in name only, the independence that England has given Egypt is still essentially the status of a protectorate. Later, whenever the Nationalist Party launched anti-British movements, England responded with severe measures. In 1930, the King of Egypt abolished the Constitution of 1923 and replaced it with a new constitution, reducing the number of members of parliament and concentrating power in himself. This was also the result of British instigation, in order to curb the power of the Nationalist Party. All these behaviors are driven by England's desire to control the Suez Canal. Judging from today's international situation, England's control over the Suez Canal is even more urgently needed. Therefore, how England will deal with the nationwide anti-British movement in Egypt, which is like a raging tide, is indeed a very interesting question.</p>
<p>The current anti-British movement in Egypt was ignited by the Nationalist Party. There is no doubt about this. According to the Nationalist Party's platform, it has always sought to free Egypt from British shackles and achieve complete independence, while at the same time neutralizing the Suez Canal, returning Sudan to Egypt, and achieving absolute autonomy in domestic and foreign affairs. However, the Nationalist Party's power in the current parliament is weak, making it difficult to influence the political situation. Therefore, its stirring up of anti-British sentiment among the people and the launching of large-scale popular movements is inevitable. However, what we must pay attention to is that England will not easily concede the conditions it has retained for Egyptian independence. Because one concession will cause a great threat to the British Empire. Moreover, it is also a question whether Egypt has the ability to defend itself against other aggressive countries after completely breaking free from British shackles. Nevertheless, we cannot but express our admiration for Egypt's persistent national movement. Being controlled by others is intolerable for all spirited nations, and those who choose to resolutely resist are enterprising nations.</p>
<p>It is necessary to lead the completion of autonomous organizations and the development of autonomous undertakings as the goal. 7. The Central Party Headquarters should establish a local autonomy institute within two months to cultivate autonomous talents. The local party headquarters should select party workers and party members with considerable academic qualifications from their respective parties and send them to the institute to授以自治智能, (the deadline is three months.) After graduation, they will be sent to work in various places. Local gentry who are respected and have legitimate occupations and are enthusiastic about their work must also be given appropriate training to cultivate leading talents for local autonomy. Are you in agreement with the above? Respectfully request a public decision. Proposal Examination Committee Party Affairs Group, (Central News Agency, 22nd).</p>

It was not until the morning of the 22nd that the situation eased slightly. Liu Yushu, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, said that if someone attempts to disrupt public order without any other background, then no matter whether there are three or four thousand people, the Bureau has the power to disperse them and prevent them from affecting local security. If there are unexpected relationships, even if the number of people is small, it will be difficult to maintain. In the past half month, the Bureau has been in a state of anxiety at all times, but this is a matter related to the entire situation in North China. It is necessary for the authorities in North China to have a unified approach so that the local security maintained by the Bureau will not change. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>England and America Remain Silent</h3>
<p>(Washington) While the government here remains silent about the sudden easing of the situation in North China, it feels somewhat relieved. Information from London says that Japan fears that its actions will be disadvantageous in the naval conference, so it has temporarily stopped. Many people here believe this. The European diplomatic community here believes that Japan's ambition has no end, and that there is a possibility of restoring cooperation between England and Russia, as well as between the United States and Russia. However, American officials have not expressed this. (National News, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The British diplomatic community believes today that the temporary postponement of Japan's actions in North China is because it fears that it will promote closer cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States in the naval conference. The diplomatic community also believes that although the situation in the Far East has eased slightly at present, they are all keeping silent about future developments. (National News, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Times of England Comments on the Sino-Japanese Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The Times today has an editorial entitled "Autonomy in North China", discussing the recent developments in Sino-Japanese relations, saying that although the failure of the Japanese military's plan has not遏止呢 the second step towards Pan-Asianism, it may make it progress more slowly. Considering the reasons held by the Japanese side and the attitude of the majority of people in North China who do not agree with such autonomy, this plan of Japan's is particularly contrary to the promises it made in the Washington Convention of 1922. Whether the secession is one province or five provinces, the Chinese government certainly has a reason to be angry at this action that harms Chinese sovereignty and dignity, and is equivalent to a military seizure. Nanjing has indeed responded resolutely, which is certainly a surprise. However, the Fifth Plenary Session being held in Nanjing has helped to raise the courage of the Chinese government. Chiang Kai-shek's suggestion that if the Japanese government respects China's rights and dignity, Sino-Japanese friendship is not impossible, has not prevented the majority of representatives at the Fifth Plenary Session from granting the Chinese government full diplomatic powers, so that today there is still hope that the Chinese government can find a way to induce the Japanese military to curb its demands.

<h3>The Soviet Union's Stakhanovite Movement: Stalin's Speech Clarifies its Significance and Purpose, Raising Labor Productivity to Complete the Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin delivered the following speech at the All-Union Stakhanovite Movement Congress:</p>
<p>The Stakhanovite movement is not an ordinary movement of male and female workers, but one of the most glorious pages in the history of Soviet socialist construction. What is the significance of this movement? First, it is a new upsurge of socialist competition, a new and higher stage of socialist competition. Why is it new? Why is it higher? Because it is easily distinguished from the past stages of socialist competition. In the past three years, socialist competition did not necessarily maintain a necessary connection with new technologies. Strictly speaking, we did not have new technologies at that time, but in the current stage of socialist competition, the Stakhanovite movement has a necessary connection with new technologies. This movement cannot be imagined without new and higher technologies. Before you are figures such as Stakhanov, Busygin, Smetanin, Krivonoss, Boronin, and Vinogradov. They are all new people, new workers. They can now fully control their technology and advance it. We did not have such people three years ago. They are new and special people.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Stakhanovite movement is to exceed the current technical standards, exceed the current work capacity, and exceed the current production plans and balances. Therefore, they want to overcome the records that have already passed for our era and our new people. This movement breaks the old concepts of technology, breaks the old records of technology, old work capacity, and old production plans. It requires the establishment of new and high records, work capacity, and production plans.</p>
<p>It requires the completion of our industrial revolution. From this point of view, the Stakhanovite movement is deeply revolutionary in nature. Some people here have said that the Stakhanovite movement is a manifestation of new and higher technical standards, and a standard for socialist high labor productivity (which is absolutely impossible in capitalist society). This is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>How can capitalism destroy and overcome feudalism? Because it can produce higher labor productivity records and can make society obtain more products than feudal society. Capitalism overcomes feudalism because it makes society richer. How can and must socialism defeat the capitalist economic system? There is no other reason than that it can produce examples of higher labor productivity than the capitalist economic system, because it can provide society with more products compared to the capitalist economic system, and can make society richer. Some people believe that we can consolidate socialism on the basis of a poor life and average assets. This kind of opinion is absolutely incorrect. This is a petty-bourgeois socialist idea. In reality, if socialism wants to win, it must be based on higher labor productivity than capitalism, it must be based on abundant products and various commodities, and it must be based on the rich and cultural life of all members of society. However, if we want to achieve this goal, if we want to make our socialist society the most prosperous, then we must have higher labor productivity than the major capitalist countries. Otherwise, we will be in vain if we want abundant products and commodities.</p>
<p>The significance of the Stakhanovite movement lies in breaking the previous inadequate technical records, exceeding the labor productivity of the major capitalist countries, thereby creating the possibility of consolidating Soviet socialism even more, and the possibility of transforming our country into the most prosperous country. "Although, the significance of the Stakhanovite movement is not limited to this, it also prepares the premise for the transition of socialism to communism. The principle of socialism is to each according to his ability, to each according to his work (not to each according to his needs). It means that the cultural and technical level of the working class is not very high at that time, the contradiction between mental and physical labor still exists, and labor productivity has not yet produced abundant commodities, so at that time the society cannot distribute products according to each person's needs, but only determines their remuneration according to their amount of work.</p>
<p>"Communism is a higher stage in development. The principle of communism is to each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. The distribution of products is not based on the amount of work, but according to the needs of each member with a very high cultural level. It means that at that time the cultural and technical level of the working class has been extremely superior, enough to eliminate the contradiction between mental and physical labor, and labor productivity has been extremely improved, enough to guarantee abundant products, so at that time the distribution of products can be based on their needs.</p>
<p>Some say that the opposition between mental and physical labor can reduce the cultural and technical level of engineers, technicians, and mental laborers, and make the culture and technology of mental and physical labor at the same level, that is, to eliminate this opposition in this way. This is absolutely wrong. Only petty-bourgeois talkers can delusionally realize communism in this way. In fact, the elimination of the opposition between mental and physical labor can only be achieved by raising the cultural and technical level of the working class to be equal to that of engineering and technical experts. "If it is said that this kind of improvement is absolutely impossible, it is a ridiculous idea. Under the Soviet system, the country's productivity has been liberated from the shackles of capitalism, labor has been liberated from oppression and exploitation, the working class has already obtained political power, and the children of laborers have been given various opportunities to obtain full technical education. This kind of improvement is absolutely possible. Only by raising the culture and technology of the laboring class can the source of the contradiction between mental and physical labor be eliminated, and labor productivity can be improved to obtain the abundant commodities necessary for the transition from socialism to communism. There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>"The Stakhanovite movement is enough to be a link in this kind of transformation, because it has opened up the beginning for raising the cultural and technical level of our country's laboring class, although it is still weak, it is still an end. The Stakhanovite movement is that the people can fully control the technology of their work and obtain the maximum limit of harvest from the technology. At present, there are only a few Stakhanovite movers, but who can doubt that they will soon increase tenfold? Stakhanovite movers are inventors in our industry. The Thai-Hahanovite movement represents the future of our industry. It contains the seeds of raising the cultural and technical level of the laboring class in the future. It has opened a road for us. Only by moving forward can we raise labor productivity to the highest level, so as to transform from socialism to communism and eliminate the opposition between mental and physical labor. Is this not obvious?</p>
<p>"We are now at the cradle of the Stakhanovite movement, at its beginning, and we must pay attention to some of the characteristics of the Stakhanovite movement; first, this movement seems to be spontaneous, almost entirely from the bottom up, and does not come from the coercion of the management offices of our various enterprises.</p>
<p>"Secondly, this movement, once started, immediately moves forward; regardless of the intentions of the management offices of our various enterprises, and even fighting against them. Precisely because it is spontaneous, precisely because it is from the bottom up, it is the most important and immeasurable movement of the present era. "Another characteristic of the Stakhanovite movement is that it is all over the country; and it does not develop gradually, but moves forward with the unparalleled speed of thunder and lightning. The Stakhanovite movement has become an absolutely mature event. How will this point be explained? What makes it develop so quickly?</p>
<p>What is the source of the Stakhanovite movement? There are at least four reasons:</p>
<p>"First, the Stakhanovite movement first came from the thorough improvement of the material living conditions of laborers. Comrades' lives have been improved. Life is happier than before; life is happy, and work must also improve. Then the output increases? Then there are heroes of working men and women. This is the most important source of the Stakhanovite movement. If we also have panic, also have the plague of unemployment in the working class, if our lives are bad, without happiness, without hope, then we will not have a Stakhanovite movement (applause). Our proletarian revolution is the only revolution in the world that can give people an opportunity to not only show its political results, but also show its material living results. "Only our revolution, not only destroys the shackles of capitalism and gives people freedom, but also gives people the material conditions for a glorious life. This contains the power and invincibility of our revolution. This is why our life is so joyful, and why the Stakhanovite movement occurred.</p>
<p>"Second, the Stakhanovite movement is due to the elimination of the exploitation system in our country. The people of our country do not work for exploiters, do not work for wealthy non-laborers, but work for themselves, for their own class, for their excellent people, that is, for the Soviet society where the laboring class holds political power. This is why our work can have social significance, and it is a noble and glorious cause. Under capitalism, labor is of a private nature, so human labor under capitalism is not valued. In this case, it is clear that there cannot be a Stakhanovite movement. "There is another event about the Soviet system. Laborers here are respected, laborers here are not despised, and do not feel lonely. On the contrary, laborers and we all feel that we are free people of our own country, a social worker, and if their work is excellent, they can do their best to society, they are a labor hero, and they are full of honor. Only in this case can there be a Stakhanovite movement. This is very obvious.</p>
<p>"The third source of the Stakhanovite movement is the existence of new technologies in our country. The Stakhanovite movement has been inextricably linked to new technologies from the beginning. Without new technologies, without new factories and new machines, the Stakhanovite movement could not have occurred in our country. Without new technologies, the technical level can only be increased by one or two times, not more. If the technical level increases five or six times, it means that they are completely built on new technologies. It means that our country's industrialization, the transformation of our country's factories, and the existence of new technologies and new machines have opened up a road for the Stakhanovite movement." But only new technologies cannot make us progress so much. Even if there are first-class technologies, even if there are first-class factories, but no one can surpass this kind of technology, technology is only technology. In order for new technologies to produce their effect, there must be powerful people, cadres, and working men and women who can dominate technology and promote technology.</p>
<p>"The emergence and development of the Stakhanovite movement indicates that such cadres have risen among our working men and women. Two years ago, the Party said that although we have new factories, although we have new machines for various gold industries, our work is only half completed. The Party said that the enthusiasm for building new factories must be supplemented by the enthusiasm for dominating new factories. Only in this way can we achieve great success. In these two years, the work of dominating new machines and cultivating new cadres has obviously been carried out, and it is clear that we now have such cadres. Without these new people, we would not have any Stakhanovite movement. This is very easy to understand. Therefore, the new people from working men and women who are able to dominate new technologies have formed a force to generate and promote the Stakhanovite movement.</p>
<p>"I said that the Stakhanovite movement did not develop gradually, but like the bursting of a dike. Obviously, it has overcome various obstacles. Some people have blocked it, some people have troubled it, but now the Stakhanovite movement has accumulated strength, broke through obstacles, and flooded the country. What does this mean? Who is the real obstacle to this kind of movement? This is the old technical level, and the people who protect this kind of level. "Several years ago, our engineers, technicians, and economic workers adapted to the technologically backward working men and women and established a certain technical level. Since then, several years have passed. During this period, the people have gradually developed and obtained a technical foundation, but the technical level has not changed. This level has become an obstacle to our new people. This is very obvious. Can we still be loyal to our backwardness? Can we take the permanent backwardness of our working men and women as a starting point? We seem to have failed to move further from this question. Why? Perhaps because we do not have enough courage to break the conservatism of our engineers and technicians, break the old traditions and standards, so that the revolutionary forces of the laboring class can be fully developed. What else?</p>
<p>"They talk about science. It is said that some books on technical materials issue orders against the demands of the Stakhanovite movement to improve technical standards. But what is meant by science here? Scientific materials are often hindered by practice and experience. What kind of science is capable of breaking the connection between it and practice and experience? Science is called science precisely because it can deny inherited ideas, not be afraid to raise its hand to resist the past that is trending towards death, and listen to the voices of experience and practice. "If it were not for this, we would not have any science. Take astronomy as an example, we will adhere to Ptolemy's outdated theoretical system. We will have no biology and still seek comfort in human creation legends. We will have no chemistry and still adhere to the prophecies of alchemists. This is why I often think that our engineering, technical, and economic workers are always far behind the Stakhanovite movement. They must abandon their old technical standards and place themselves on the Stakhanovite road to succeed. Or will ask me, in general, how should technical standards be reformed? Or said that we do not need any technical standards. This is also wrong. And it is stupid. "Without technical standards, planned economy will be impossible. In addition, technical standards are also necessary to promote the backward masses and make them catch up with the level of advanced workers. Technical standards are a great regulatory force that can organize the labor masses in industry around the leading members of the laboring class. Therefore, we need technical standards, but not the existing standards, but higher standards.</p>
<p>"Some people also say that technical standards are still necessary; but they must be increased to the levels reached by Stakhanovs, Busyginss, and Vinogradovss. This is also wrong. This kind of standard is not possible at present; because the less technologically advanced working men and women will not be able to complete this kind of standard. The technical standards we need are between the existing standards and the standards of Stakhanov and others. "In any case, one thing is very clear, that is, the existing technical standards are not in line with the facts. They are backward and have become an obstacle to our industry; in order to prevent the development of industry from being hindered, they must be replaced by new and higher technical standards. New people, new era, new technical standards.</p>
<p>"From the point of view of the benefits of the Stakhanovite movement, what will be our future tasks? First, our task is to help the movement of Stakhanovite movers, so that it continues to develop, so that it is popularized and deeply rooted in various provinces and regions of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, we must eliminate the various stubborn conservatives among the economic, engineering, and technical workers, who are unwilling to move forward and systematically obstruct the Stakhanovite movement. "I believe that if we can complete this kind of work, the Stakhanovite movement will be able to fully develop, will be able to encompass the whole country, and show us the miracle of new achievements.</p>
<p>"A few more words need to be said to explain this conference and its significance. Lenin said that a true leader, a Bolshevik Party member, must be someone who not only teaches workers, but also learns from workers and peasants. Some party members are unwilling to accept Lenin's words. But history shows that Lenin is 100% correct in this. Millions of workers and peasants are indeed working, living, and fighting. Who can say that they are living in blind life and not accumulating huge experience in life and struggle? Who can doubt that a leader who ignores this kind of experience will not become a leader? Therefore, our Party and government leaders must not only teach laborers, but also learn from them. I do not deny that you have received some education from government leaders by attending this conference, and at the same time, our government leaders have also received a lot of education from you Stakhanovite movers. Comrades, thank you, thank you for the lessons you have given me." (Thunderous applause) (TASS Telegram of the 22nd)</p>

<h3>French North Africa to Build Naval Base to Control the Western Mediterranean</h3>
<p>(Paris) Naval Minister Pietri recently decided to build a new naval base on the coast of French Algeria in Africa. The Petit Parisien newspaper commented on this today, saying that this decision is extremely important. The new naval base is built in the port of Mers El Kébir near the city of Oran, which is backed by mountains and faces the sea, with a dangerous terrain. It is also an essential route to the Strait of Gibraltar. After the construction of the naval base is completed, the French Navy can control the western Mediterranean. France lacks seaplane bases on the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, which can be remedied. In addition, an underground tunnel will be built between the port of Mers El Kébir and the city of Oran. (Central News Agency Telegram of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Amidst Naval Conference, U.S. Attitude Toward Japan, Philips Knows Far East Issues Well, Sending Him Attending Contains Deep Meaning</h3>
<p>(Washington) Authorities here indicated today that if Japan attempts to have the countries concerned tacitly approve Japan's adventurous actions in China at the naval conference, the United States is prepared to refuse. Officials believe that the Japanese representatives will launch an action to recognize "Manchukuo" at the beginning of the naval conference. This can be seen from the government's sending Undersecretary of State Philips to join the delegation. Mr. Philips is one of the most capable diplomats in the State Department, is familiar with Far Eastern issues, and tends to favor a large navy policy. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<h3>American Military Officer Creates Record By Ascending Into the Stratosphere in a Balloon</h3>

<h3>Remains of Famous British Admiral to Receive State Funeral, Funeral Set for Monday</h3>
<p>(London) The government has decided to hold a state funeral for the late Admiral of the Fleet Earl Jellicoe, to be buried under the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, alongside Admiral Nelson, who defeated Napoleon. (Havas Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The funeral of Earl Jellicoe, the famous British admiral who passed away on Wednesday, is scheduled for noon on the day, according to the Admiralty. His wife has received many condolence telegrams from all over the world. The British Emperor and Empress also sent a letter of condolence. At the same time, according to the Reuters correspondent in Berlin, on the day of the Earl's funeral, the German Navy plans to half-mast the new German naval flag, and Vice Admiral Forster will represent the German fleet to participate in the funeral.

<h3>French Ambassador Meets with German Foreign Minister: Promoting Amity Between the Two Nations; Current Political Situation Discussed Amicably; Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact Also Mentioned</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, has returned from Paris and resumed his post. German Foreign Minister Neurath received him today. According to a public statement, the two discussed the current political issues in a friendly manner. It is reported that recently, diplomatic circles have been discussing the possibility of improving relations between France and Germany. A German official news agency claims that the talks between the German Foreign Minister and the French Ambassador today are a clear indication of the goodwill of both governments. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Following the French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet's conversation with German Führer Hitler yesterday, the German statement was worded very amicably. Informed sources say that the Ambassador's talks with Hitler were exploratory in nature and involved discussions on the relationship between France and Germany and the international situation dominated by the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. While their significance should not be underestimated, they should also not be overemphasized. At present, the European situation is quite serious, and all countries are most anxious. Germany's ability to observe the situation with equanimity is certainly commendable. Consequently, there is a trend towards easing tensions between France and Germany, which may improve further and open the door to negotiations. It is generally believed that the current talks between important French and German figures touched upon the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, as Germany does not seem to welcome this pact, and its ratification is about to be submitted to the French Parliament for approval. Regarding this matter, François-Poncet must have reiterated that the purpose of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is solely to maintain European peace and has no intention of being hostile to other countries.

The League of Nations General Assembly's Committee on Adjustments to the Sanctions Plan previously adopted the proposal of Belgian Prime Minister de Broqueville, entrusting Britain and France with finding a way to end the Italo-Ethiopian war. The meeting between Patteson and Saint-Quentin is to fulfill this mission. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Magal, Tigray - General Seyoum, west of Tigray, has been avoiding contact with Italian columns. Today, he finally clashed with the 15th battalion of the Italian indigenous army at Danbyan with 600 men. These 600 men were positioned on a mountain peak 6,000-7,000 feet high, using the famous Amba Aradam fortress as a shield, and bombarded the Italian soldiers with rifles and machine guns for several hours. Seeing Italian reinforcements arrive, they retreated into the mountains. The Italians claim that they suffered few casualties in the battle.</p>
<p>King Haile Selassie took advantage of this opportunity to travel to Jijiga for a military conference with General Nasibu, commander of the southern Ethiopian army, and General Welde Tsadiq. He has decided on a new Ethiopian military strategy. This was the first time the King had traveled by airplane, which can be considered a break with tradition. According to eyewitnesses, the trip was very effective. He was greeted with thunderous cheers wherever he went. Upon arriving in Jijiga, he reviewed the troops and exhorted the soldiers to fight cautiously. He also went to the Swedish hospital to award medals to several wounded soldiers. He then traveled by car from Jijiga to Dagabur, where he was very interested to see four light tankette vehicles seized by Ethiopian troops from the enemy near Anale. He then returned to the capital by plane, arriving safely this morning. When departing from Harar, he narrowly escaped an attack by two Italian planes. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Returns to Capital, Says Military Strength Sufficient to Resist Powerful Enemy; Aircraft Effectiveness Very Limited</h3>
<p>After returning to the capital from the front lines, the Ethiopian Emperor was interviewed in writing by a special correspondent of the Associated Press. According to the Emperor's reply, "Up to now, the fighting strength of the southern army has proven sufficient to resist modern armies and even defeat them." He also said, "The Italian army has not fully achieved its objectives and has fabricated many false victories. The Italian planes have not been able to threaten our generals, soldiers, and civilians. Their bombing effectiveness is very limited. For example, in the Golahei area, Italian planes dropped 100 bombs, resulting in only 17 deaths and injuries." (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - After inspecting the southern front lines, the Emperor returned to the capital. It is said that there are many reasons to ensure the solidity of the Ethiopian army's positions. The Emperor denied Italian claims of a major victory in the Ogaden province and the defection of Ethiopian chieftains to the Italian army. He also said that although Italian planes launched aerial attacks, the Ethiopian people remained calm. The Emperor's entourage reiterated the story of the Ethiopian army capturing four Italian tanks, as witnessed that day. According to the account, six men in the vehicles were killed on the spot, one escaped in a motorized vehicle, and the remaining one hid inside the vehicle, resisting arrest with a gun. An Ethiopian soldier, wounded in one eye, angrily extended his arm into the viewing hole, grabbed the man's hair, and dragged his head out of the hole, severing his head from his body with a sharp knife. The Ethiopian army now has four vehicles and is scrambling for the hand grenades inside. Due to carelessness, one grenade fell to the ground and exploded, killing one comrade and injuring two others. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Jijiga - Because the Emperor personally came to the front line yesterday, morale has been greatly boosted. Today, the army launched a counter-offensive against the Italian army south of Dagabur. Despite Italian aerial bombardment, they were able to intercept four tanks and capture many prisoners. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - According to a public bulletin here, an Italian unit departed from Magal and advanced northwest, entering an area ambushed by the Ethiopian army. The Ethiopian soldiers all leaped out from their hiding places behind rocks and trees and opened fire on the enemy soldiers. This was followed by hand-to-hand combat. The enemy suffered heavy losses, their commander was killed, and several soldiers died. The remaining troops fled back to Magal. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Asmara - Staff officers of the Italian army here are confident that the Italian army will be able to hold the territory it has occupied on the northern front. Although aerial reconnaissance reports that at least 50,000 Ethiopian soldiers have gathered south of Magal, Italian authorities say that if the Ethiopian army attacks, it will be heavily bombarded by the artillery units currently stationed at Magal. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Asmara - The headquarters here announced today that white soldiers fighting on behalf of Ethiopia cannot expect leniency from the Italian army. It is known that there are many foreigners in Ethiopia currently leading the Ethiopian army to fight against Italy. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Sea: British Naval Maneuvers of Unprecedented Scale</h3>
<p>Alexandria - The British Navy held combat exercises in the eastern Mediterranean Sea today. The scale of the exercises was unprecedented in the Mediterranean. When Prince Muhammad Ali, nephew of the King of Egypt, boarded the British cruiser HMS Berwick to observe the exercises, a 21-gun salute was fired. He was accompanied by the Egyptian Prime Minister, his cabinet members, and Sir Miles Lampson, the British High Commissioner for Egypt and Sudan. A division of warships, including five battleships, six cruisers, eighteen destroyers, and two aircraft carriers, led by the cruiser HMS Ajax, advanced in a line. The five battleships fired 21 rounds each from their 15-inch guns at a target 11 miles away, causing it to break into two pieces. Destroyers provided smoke screen cover and participated in the attack. Sixty aircraft practiced dropping bombs. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>US Oil Shipments to Italy Halted: Interior Secretary Tells Merchants to Comply Voluntarily</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Secretary of the Interior and Administrator of the Federal Oil Administration, Ickes, today requested that all crude oil producers in the country assist the government in stopping sales to belligerent nations to avoid war. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Interior Secretary Ickes asked the American oil industry to voluntarily stop shipping oil to Italy. Ickes issued a statement today saying that the Bureau of Mines' report showed that oil shipments to Italy in September were higher than in August. Although he has no authority over the matter, he feels that oil companies should understand the government's efforts to prevent the supply of war materials to belligerent countries. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Houston - Southern oil companies have expressed their willingness to comply with Interior Secretary Ickes' advice to oil companies to voluntarily stop shipping oil to Italy. Officials at Standard Oil of New Jersey stated that the company had already stopped selling oil to Italy weeks ago. Shell Oil also stated that it had not shipped any oil abroad. Mexican Oil and other companies also said that they must comply with government warnings. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) After the U.S. government advised its oil companies not to ship oil to Italy, political and oil industry circles here are very pleased, especially political circles, which believe that the U.S. government's attitude towards sanctions against Italy is in line with that of other countries, especially Britain. This will definitely benefit the negotiations between the British and American oil industries, and the views of the U.S. and the League of Nations on this matter will become more aligned. Previously, the British oil industry was deeply concerned that after the League of Nations member states imposed an oil embargo on Italy, the U.S. might profit from it. Now that concern has been alleviated, but it is said that the reaction of the American oil industry still needs to be observed. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since the member states of the League of Nations implemented sanctions against Italy, the League of Nations itself has also implemented sanctions. Going forward, the Secretariat of the League of Nations will try to avoid purchasing Italian goods. For example, the materials used to build the new League of Nations headquarters and other supplies will no longer be purchased from Italy. The Secretariat of the League of Nations also has a bar, originally opened by an Italian citizen. The League of Nations is now also requiring the owner of the bar to stop purchasing Italian goods. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The United Federation of Fruit and Vegetable Growers held a meeting yesterday to study the impact of the sanctions implemented by the member states of the League of Nations on the industry and to discuss appropriate countermeasures. Prime Minister Mussolini personally chaired the meeting. Italy's annual production of fruits and vegetables ranges from 6.7 million to 8 million metric tons, second only to grain in terms of production volume. Most of those who buy fresh fruits and vegetables from Italy are countries that do not participate in the sanctions, while the number purchased by countries participating in the sanctions is relatively small. Therefore, after the implementation of sanctions, this export commodity should not be significantly affected. As for citrus fruits, this year's harvest is not very abundant, so even if it is sanctioned, it is not a major concern. On the other hand, the sale of lemons, which are subject to sanctions, will be severely affected, but the quantity sold in the domestic market is still considerable, so there is no need to worry. In addition, Italy relies heavily on foreign countries for dried vegetables. Although the source of supply will be cut off in the future, domestic production can still be increased. However, canned fruits and vegetables will be greatly affected, as the annual production value of these commodities is in the range of 50,000 lire, half of which is exported to foreign countries, and there will be no way out in the future. However, the Federation has decided to make efforts to expand domestic consumption to remedy the situation and advocates the establishment of a joint operation company for all of the above commodities for centralized management.

<h3>Political Turmoil Brewing in France: Laval's Enigmatic Financial and Diplomatic Policies; Determined to Fight the Socialist Party with All His Might; National Bank's Reserves Decreasing</h3>
<p>(Paris) When the Chamber of Deputies meets next week, the Socialist Party is determined to launch a vigorous attack on the government. Therefore, France is now in danger of seeing another cabinet crisis. According to political observers, since the Socialist Party has made this decision, Prime Minister Laval's chances of coping with the political and financial turmoil will be greatly reduced. The Socialist Party will use the issue of the fascist associations as a way to attack. The left-wing parties have been increasingly opposed to these associations, especially because of the shooting incident in Limoges on November 16, which injured 33 people. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party are now demanding the suppression of these associations, one of the main ones being organized by veterans. The members of the Radical Party hold divergent opinions. Their representative in the government, led by Herriot, believes that because the diplomatic situation is currently tense, and the franc's position is very unstable, they oppose triggering a cabinet crisis at this time. However, the extreme left-wing, led by former Prime Minister Daladier, is eager to overthrow Laval. The tense situation is actually caused by the interplay of politics and finance. Due to the political unrest, gold has been flowing out of the Bank of France's treasury. Laval will probably fight to the death in the Chamber of Deputies to fight the Socialist Party, not only to preserve his position, but also to maintain the franc and maintain the continuity of French foreign policy. Laval may rely on the unstable position of the franc to make the Radical Party fearful and turn to him for assistance. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Bank of France's weekly report (from November 8 to November 15), the gold outflow totaled 933,000,000 francs, and reserves decreased to 70,398,000,000 francs. The discount rate increased by 298,000,000 francs, reaching 8,121,000,000 francs. Short-term loans secured by government bonds increased by more than 40 million francs. As for the bank's liabilities, the amount of banknotes in circulation decreased by 644,000,000 francs, and long-term deposits and demand deposits increased by a total of 227,000,000 francs. The reserve ratio decreased from 74.40 percent to 73.82 percent. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Bank of France today increased the discount rate again from 4 percent to 5 percent. This action is the second in a week. On November 14, the discount rate suddenly increased from 3 percent to 4 percent. It is said that the reason is to stop the outflow of large amounts of cash, and it also reflects the domestic political unrest. Currently, advocates of inflation are becoming more active, and the movement advocating the devaluation of the franc is also visibly increasing. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>

<h3>Northeast Gold Mines: Japanese and Puppet Regime Actively Develop</h3>
<p>This year, no less than 10 million yuan; future trends will continue to increase</p>
<p>Changchun Newsletter: The gold production in Northeast China has always been a focus of world attention. The following is a summary of information from various Japanese and puppet regime sources. According to the Japanese side, the amount of gold produced in Northeast China this year is estimated to be absolutely no less than 10 million yuan. For example, the "Manchuria" Gold Mining Company's performance from January to August this year yielded 1.81 million yuan, with 600,000 yuan in August alone. From August to December, the average monthly yield should be 500,000 yuan. Other gold mining companies are reported to have earned 3.6 million yuan. Furthermore, there are more than 15,000 employees in the gold mining industry in Northeast China. Therefore, it is quite reliable to estimate that the actual yield will be within 7.5 million yuan based on previous harvests. Even if we use a general statistical estimate, it is certain that it will be 10 million yuan. Moreover, the estimated purchase of gold produced from January to August exceeded 6 million yuan. Therefore, the aforementioned amount of gold produced can be largely believed. With the active management of the Japanese, the amount of gold produced in Northeast China will continue to increase.</p>

There is no longer any danger to the riverbank wharf, the Xiao-Shao Highway, and the Hang-Jiang Railway.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Business Community Petitions Government to Rescue Industries; Proposes Establishing Special Financial Institutions or Allocating Large Sums from the Three Banks</h3>
<p>Shanghai business leaders Yu Hesui, Rong Zongjing, Liu Hongsheng, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, and others yesterday separately submitted petitions to Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, National Economic Commission Standing Committee Member Song Ziwen, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, and Industry Minister Chen Gongbo, requesting the government to rescue industries. Excerpts from the original text are as follows: "Regarding the petition, we believe that in recent years, financial resources have been scarce, silver has flowed out, all industries have declined, and production has decreased daily. If we continue without providing relief, the total economic collapse will become almost inevitable. Fortunately, the government resolutely reformed the currency policy and implemented managed currency. On the day the order was issued, the entire country responded positively. Although implementation has just begun, financial activities have been seen in the market, and international exchange rates have gradually stabilized. Friendly countries have provided support, and the people have embraced it. It cannot be said that this is not a good plan for governing the country and a great strategy for saving the times. However, various industries, which are the foundation of the nation's economic life, are still on the verge of collapse due to a lack of working capital, and production is decreasing daily, resulting in a daily increase in imports over exports. We have not yet received assistance from the government. If we continue to allow industrialists to seek their own solutions, begging at the doors of banks as before, then most of our domestic banks are commercial organizations and are unable to engage in industrial lending due to insufficient capital. Moreover, even if they are slightly accommodating, they mostly require guarantees of the products produced and are unwilling to accept loans on real estate. Under these circumstances, not only are entrepreneurs in a difficult situation, but also a significant amount of capital is invisibly reduced in society, how can production not decline, and how can imports not increase sharply? Following this result, how can the reformed currency policy not be shaken? Therefore, to save the industries to save the country, now is the time when the government's financial resources are concentrated and credit has been established. It is urgently necessary to establish special financial institutions, with the government in charge, roughly imitating the industrial, development, or promotion bank systems of various countries, specializing in rescuing industries, and using the fixed assets owned by industrialists as collateral for loans, with long-term, low-interest rates to meet their needs. On the one hand, the Central Bank should lower market interest rates and find ways to recover high-interest bonds so that funds are not concentrated on bonds alone. In this way, domestic businesses can have a turnaround, and international trade can be balanced. Otherwise, if production does not improve, even if the government suspends convertibility to balance exchange rates, imports will still be imports, what good will it do? Moreover, because industries are declining, unemployment will increase, society will become more difficult to stabilize, national tax revenues will become shorter, and the future of the nation's foundation will become more dangerous. Some say that this move by the government is a strategy to concentrate strength and unify finance, and that the issuance of currency should still have a statutory reserve to secure the government's credit. If currency is issued to fill capital without a reserve, it is tantamount to inflating the currency, which will inevitably lead to currency depreciation and rising prices. They do not know that the issuance and withdrawal of currency must be based on the supply and demand of the market. If currency is issued for production, then the currency is the capital of the production industry, and the assets of the production industry are the indirect reserve for the issuance. The currency value will naturally not depreciate. There are clear precedents in European and American countries. Moreover, in the future, as production increases, national tax revenues will also increase as a result. Why would the government not be happy to do something that benefits in several ways with one action? Now, the essence is summarized into two points: 1. Please establish a special bank as soon as possible, or first allocate a large sum from the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to rescue the industry, so that various businessmen can fully utilize all their capital. 2. Please the Central Bank reduce market interest rates and find ways to recover high-interest bonds to encourage the general public to invest in industry. The situation is critical, and we urgently hope that you will implement it. If we miss the opportunity, I am afraid that it will be too late to save. Therefore, we do not hesitate to offend and respectfully appeal to your seat to consider that industry is related to the foundation of the country, and to quickly approve the implementation. Then the dying industry will hopefully obtain a chance of survival. The industry and commerce are fortunate, and the country is fortunate. Respectfully presented."</p>
<h3>President Wang Went to the Hospital for Medical Treatment Yesterday; X-Ray Examination Revealed a Bullet Remaining on the Right Side of the Spine; Determined the Correct Location and Not Necessary to Remove</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday for quiet recuperation. Besides previously inviting the Niu Huilin brothers and Doctors Noel on the morning before, the only issue that needs to be studied regarding President Wang's injury is whether the bullet in his back needs to be removed, which is still questionable. Therefore, President Wang again invited Dr. Niu Huisheng and Dr. Noel at 8:00 am yesterday morning, accompanied by Madam Chen Bijun, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, and others, and took his own car from his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to the Hongen Hospital on Great West Road, where he borrowed the hospital's X-ray machine for irradiation. It took about an hour. President Wang then returned to his residence to recuperate. Afterwards, Dr. Niu Huisheng visited President Wang's residence to report at around 10:00 am, and then visited twice more at around 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm last night. According to Dr. Niu's conversation with the reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency last night, the bullet in President Wang's back was previously X-rayed at the Central Hospital, but the photos were not very clear due to mechanical reasons, and the exact location could not be found. Having borrowed the Hongen Hospital's X-ray machine for irradiation this morning (i.e., yesterday morning), the correct location of the bullet has been determined. It is located on the right side of the fifth section of the spine, about an inch away from the spine and about one and a half inches deep. In my opinion, it is not necessary to remove it. Leaving it in place will not harm his health and can save all sorts of trouble. It is feared that after the operation, fever and other reactions may inevitably occur. There are precedents for not removing bullets such as this in foreign countries. For example, former US President Roosevelt and former French President Clemenceau were both shot and had bullets left in their bodies. The location of their bullets were in the brain, but it did not affect them, and they both enjoyed long lives. Now, the bullet in President Wang's back should be even less of a problem. Some of President Wang's relatives and friends are afraid of future troubles and advise him to have the bullet removed, but I advocate that there is no need to do this. President Wang is in very good spirits, and I have told him that he can stand up and exercise a little, and he will recover completely in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Fan Hongxian's Coffin Transported to Nanjing Last Night; Hundreds of People Followed the Hearse; A Plain Carriage and White Horses Displayed Utmost Honor and Mourning</h3>
<p>The late General Fan Hongxian, posthumously awarded the rank of Army General, martyred himself for the country twenty years ago. The central government, in order to honor the loyal and righteous, decided through the Central Standing Committee to have him buried in the mausoleum and allocated funeral expenses. A committee was formed to prepare for the burial. Yesterday, the committee, led by Zhang Gongchen and others, escorted the coffin to Nanjing. A public memorial service was held at the North Station at 4:00 PM, and the coffin was transported by the night train, with burial scheduled for January 3rd of next year. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation to Nanjing for Burial</p>
<p>General Fan was assassinated in Shanghai by Yuan Shikai in the third year of the Republic of China (1914). His coffin was temporarily placed in the Anhui Funeral Home in this city for twenty years. The central government, to honor his loyalty and righteousness, allocated funds for his burial and has surveyed land in the eastern district of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to construct a tomb. Construction is nearing completion. The funeral preparation committee dispatched Li Zhengqiu, Zhang Gongchen, and Yin Zhilu as special envoys to Shanghai to retrieve the coffin. The Ministry of Railways specially provided a hearse attached to last night's express train for transport to Nanjing, where it will be temporarily placed in the First Park. The burial is scheduled for January 3rd of next year.</p>

<p>Funeral Ceremony</p>
<p>The coffin retrieval ceremony was held at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Anhui Funeral Home in Rihui Port. Zhang Gongchen, the special envoy for the retrieval, presided over the ceremony. Representatives from the municipal political party, the military, relatives, and fellow townsmen of the Fan family, totaling over a hundred people, attended the ceremony. The Public Security Bureau's military band played music to express grief. The order of the ceremony was as follows: (1) Music, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Presiding officer takes position, (4) Attendees take position, (5) Dirge, (6) Floral tribute, (7) Reading of the coffin retrieval eulogy, (8) Three bows, (9) One minute of silence, (10) End of silence, (11) Dirge, (12) Ceremony concludes.</p>
<p>Coffin Retrieval Eulogy</p>
<p>Zhang Gongchen, Li Zhengqiu, and Yin Zhilu, Special Envoys of the Funeral Preparation Committee of the Central Executive Committee for the Late General Fan Hongxian, wrote the coffin retrieval eulogy, saying: On this, the twenty-second day of the eleventh month of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, it has been twenty-one years since the late Mr. Fan Fengxian martyred himself for the party. His coffin has been placed in Shanghai, and his final resting place is yet unsettled. Alas! The central government believes that Mr. Fan's meritorious achievements are lofty and that the rites of honoring virtue and rewarding merit must not be neglected. In the seventeenth year [of the Republic], it was decided to establish a funeral preparation committee to bury Mr. Fan in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. This year, the national government issued a decree to posthumously commend him and award him the rank of Army General. The funeral preparation committee has selected January 3rd of next year to hold the party funeral. Gongchen, Zhengqiu, Zhilu, and others have come to Shanghai to receive the coffin and will escort it to Nanjing on the twenty-second day of this month and year. On the day of the coffin retrieval, Gongchen, Zhengqiu, Zhilu, and others respectfully prepare fresh flowers and clear wine to offer a tribute to Mr. Fan's coffin and say: Mr. Fan sacrificed himself for the party, and his remains are in Shanghai. For over twenty years, they have been exposed to wild smoke and weeds. Alas! The central government has not forgotten the late martyr and will hold a party funeral for Mr. Fan in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum on January 3rd of next year. Alas, Mr. Fan, may your spirit come and partake in this offering.</p>
<p>Escorting the Coffin</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the procession escorting the coffin began, stretching for about half a mile. The procession was led by the party and national flags, followed by the Public Security Bureau's band, an honor guard, a float with a portrait of the deceased, the hearse, and hundreds of people from all walks of life following the coffin. The procession departed from the funeral home, passed through Dapu Bridge, and reached Jin Shenfu Road. It then traveled east along Xiafei Road to Baxianqiao, turned north onto Tibet Road, and then turned into Beijing Road, before turning north again onto North Henan Road, finally entering the North Station via Baoshan Road. The local military and police along the route provided strict security. The plain carriage and white horses displayed utmost honor and mourning.</p>
<p>Arrival at the North Station</p>
<p>At the entrance of the North Station, a white cloth banner was hung high. In front of the station, a plain white archway was erected, with the four characters "Spiritual Immortality" written in the middle. On the left and right were elegiac couplets from all the officers and soldiers of the Security Department, which read: "Enlightening the world and guiding the people, leaving a great name to be remembered forever;" "Securing the country and repelling foreign aggression, restoring righteousness and strengthening the mountains and rivers." The special hearse was parked beside the station, and a long table was placed in front of it, with fresh vegetables and fruits offered as a place for public sacrifice. After the coffin arrived at the North Station, it was moved onto the special car by porters. A public memorial service was then held. Fan's only son, Tianjun, and daughter, Xueyun, both of whom had grown up, attended to the coffin with great grief.</p>

<p>Party and Government Eulogy</p>
<p>On this, the twenty-second day of the eleventh month of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, Commander of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and concurrently Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and others, respectfully lead representatives from party, government, military, police, and various organizations in offering this sacrifice to the spirit of General Hongxian: Illustrious was Your Excellency, a hero of the Huai and Si regions, born of the mountains and blessed with the essence of the Marquis of Zan. Generous and passionate, taking up arms in simple clothing, You first took up the pen, and your words resonated far and wide. When the Wuchang Uprising erupted, the entire court was shaken. You advised your commander, leading the uprising in Nanjing. Fighting battle after battle, You finally captured the famous city. The captive generals fled, illuminating our banners. With the Central Plains yet to be settled, You vowed to request an expedition, gathering heroes and crossing the iron and blood. But great assistance was not gathered, and You succeeded in haste. Releasing Your sword, You sighed and retreated. The righteous clan rose again, fighting northward. The rebellious generals routed the army, fleeing east to Pengying. Like a fierce tiger crossing the river, none dared to provoke. Ordered to Shenjiang, Your blood boiled with passion. Before the opportunity arose, the mountain collapsed. Like Chen and Song before, Your fervor was comparable to that of Lai and Cen. The party and the nation mourned, and comrades swallowed their grief. With Your death, the nation was weakened; with Your passing, Your name was revered. The nation remembers Your outstanding achievements and has established a new tomb. Your soul will rest in the mausoleum, and Zhongfu will stand tall. For thousands and millions of years, Your heroic spirit will be eternally honored. Incense, flowers, wine, and libations are offered in tribute. Alas! May you accept this sacrifice.</p>
<p>Biography of the Fan Family</p>
<p>The late General Fan Hongxian, named Guangqi, with the pseudonym Guhong, was from Hefei, Anhui. He loved learning from a young age and was known in his hometown for his refined writing style. His family was poor, and he worked diligently, but he never tired of learning. He studied the classics with dedication, became a renowned scholar, and was respected by great scholars across the country. At the age of twenty-eight, he traveled to Shanghai and was invited by Yu Youren to work for the Minhu Bao newspaper. He wrote articles every day advocating for revolution, and his words were passionate and inspiring. The authorities were greatly alarmed and immediately arrested Yu Youren. Mr. Fan ran barefoot, shouting and trying to rescue him. He sued in the Shanghai Mixed Court, arguing eloquently and fearlessly. Although the newspaper was banned, Mr. Yu was able to pay a ransom and be released. From then on, Mr. Fan's name spread far and wide. He, Chen Qimei, and Song Jiaoren were regarded as the leaders of the people's party because of their talents and great integrity. Mr. Fan contributed greatly to the planning and strategy of the Guangzhou Uprising and the Wuchang Uprising. After the righteous army rose, Jiangdong echoed with support. At that time, Xu Shaozhen, the commander of the Qing Dynasty's Ninth Division, led ten thousand elite troops to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Many officers and soldiers wanted to rise up and respond to the Wuchang Uprising, but their plans were not yet decided. Zhang Xun relied on the Jiangfang army and planned to defend firmly, deploying his troops at Yuhuatai and facing the Ninth Division in a strict formation. The generals and officers were fearful and about to collapse. Mr. Fan persuaded Shaozhen, saying: "The Manchu Qing Dynasty is without morals, and the people are disintegrating. Now, the righteous army has risen, and the whole country is responding. This is the time for heaven to destroy them. General, with your wisdom and talent, you are in charge of this important military post. If you seize the opportunity, support righteousness, and conquer, who would dare not follow? By punishing these captives and barbarians and saving China, it is truly a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity." Shaozhen agreed with his words, ordered his troops to attack Yuhuatai, but they ran out of ammunition and were unable to succeed. After repeated defeats, many soldiers deserted, and they retreated to Zhenjiang. Mr. Fan, along with Lin Shuqing, Bo Wenwei, and Chen Qimei, coordinated and planned, gathered righteous troops, and raised the banner of the Zhejiang-Shanghai Allied Army. They then forcefully attacked Nanjing and captured it. Zhang Xun fled, and Jiangbiao was settled. Mr. Fan's talents were diverse, and his wisdom was destined to change the world. Many heroes from Jianghuai were close to him. Having great ambitions and wanting to distinguish himself in battle, he sought to compete with military heroes. He had long cultivated his roots in Jiang and Wan. At that time, he requested President Sun to recruit five thousand brave men, called the Iron Blood Army, and personally led them. He collected military supplies, trained soldiers, and planned to pacify the Central Plains. When the peace talks were successful, the southern armies were all disbanded. Mr. Fan also assigned the military affairs to Gong Zhenpeng and returned to Shanghai, closing his doors and studying literature and history. People from Wan repeatedly recommended him as the governor of the province, but Yuan repeatedly enticed him with high-ranking positions, but he claimed illness and did not rise. When Song Jiaoren was assassinated, the righteous army in the south was about to rise again. The leaders of the people's party recommended Mr. Fan for the affairs of Wan, so he first sent Gong Zhenpeng to secretly attack Yingzhou and entered Wuhu himself, establishing a military government and sending troops to occupy Datong and pacify the prefectures along the Huai River to the north. When Nanjing collapsed, the righteous army was repeatedly defeated. He still coordinated with Bo Wenwei to advance and garrison Anqing, facing Yuan's army upstream. Then Wenwei's general, Hu Wantai, betrayed and responded to Ni Sichong, turning his guns to attack the military government. The whole city was terrified. Mr. Fan went straight out to die. A talented officer helped him board a boat to escape. After the righteous army had secretly joined Yuan's forces, the state and counties listed him as a wanted man and changed his name, fleeing to Japan. Not long after, he returned to Shanghai on the orders of President Sun to plan another uprising. At that time, Zheng Rucheng had occupied the Shanghai Arsenal and built several layers of trenches, fortifications, and cannons, repairing defenses, training soldiers, and inspecting weapons. The righteous army attacked with all its strength, but could not capture it. Mr. Fan and Chen Qimei plotted to overcome the difficulties to achieve their goal. Chen Yuanfu, a former servant of the arsenal, was a fellow townsman of Mr. Fan and respected him. He gathered more than ten comrades to join him and gradually gained influence, obtaining several hundred people. Mr. Fan encouraged them to remove its generals and officers and rise up to respond to Mr. Fan, but Mr. Fan held back and did not act. Rucheng's army was repeatedly alarmed at night. A spy informed Chen Yuanfu of the plot, and Yuanfu was killed. Mr. Fan's plan became more urgent. Rucheng was afraid and telegraphed Yuan. Yuan sent assassins to assassinate Mr. Fan at night. This was on the twentieth day of the ninth month of the third year of the Republic of China. Mr. Fan was generous, upright, courageous, and unusually righteous. He was also able to generously give money to the officers. At the Minli Bao newspaper, all his income was used to support his comrades, without using a single penny to support his family. He loved to collect books, and his collection was mostly of fine and rare editions. His finances were often insufficient, so he would sell thousands of the books he had collected, which was still not enough, and he would even pawn his curtains and mosquito nets. Therefore, the officers who came to join him all mourned his death. On the day of his death, there were those who wept uncontrollably.</p>
<h3>State Funeral for Former President Li Tomorrow; Entertainment in This City Suspended and Flags at Half-Mast</h3>

Entertainment will be suspended throughout the country, and flags will be flown at half-mast." The municipal government has ordered its subordinates to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Telegrams by Telephone Implemented the Night Before Last; Trial Run for Three Months Achieved Excellent Results; Projected Increase in Business of One-Fifth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications began implementing telegrams by telephone the night before last, with excellent results. According to Xu Baohua, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the bureau, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the use of telephone telegrams is purely for the convenience of the citizens. After 6:00 PM every night, branch offices in various locations cease operations, and telegrams must be sent to the main office, which is time-consuming and uneconomical. Therefore, after the implementation of this measure, it is expected that business will increase by one-fifth. The plan is currently to be implemented on a trial basis for three months. If the results are good, it will continue to be implemented. When customers send telegrams by telephone, they may either dictate the text or translate it into code themselves. When the bureau collects payment in the future, it will also review the telegraphic text together. If there are any errors, they can be corrected without additional charge. Customers can also freely request to send wired or wireless telegrams. Otherwise, the bureau will choose the fastest method to send the telegram.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Factories in This City</h3>

<h3>Banks and Money Houses Prepare to Replenish Funds; Maximize Commercial Lending; Support Industrial and Commercial Development of Production and Business; Revival of the City's Future is Very Promising</h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the reform of the currency system and centralized the issuance of reserves, the financial situation in Shanghai has become more active compared to before November 4th. According to the inspection results of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, the cash reserves of each issuing bank in Shanghai are on average above 70%, which is quite sufficient. Other non-issuing banks, as well as large and small money houses, have followed the Ministry's order and exchanged legal tender with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications at a rate of 60% cash and 40% bonds. Therefore, the financial sector can cope with the mutual turnover of funds with ease. It is learned from the banking sector that the banks and money houses in this city are secure themselves, and to promote the prosperity of the market, they should maximize lending to industrial and commercial sectors to maintain industrial and commercial development and production. Therefore, in recent days, banks and money houses have been engaging in commercial lending to sound factories and shops, and the situation is quite good. The future of the city's revival is very promising.</p>
<h3>Petition of Salt Farmers in Yuyao Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, all the official salt farms in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, have a total of 507,040 salt pans, making it the most famous salt-producing area in Jiangnan. Recently, under the pretext of excessive salt storage, the local salt factories have announced a temporary suspension of salt collection. The salt farmers have been petitioning for several months. Subsequently, the Salt Transport Envoy issued a notice ordering manufacturers to collect salt at a 40% discount from October 5th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Salt Farmers' Side</p>
<p>Believing that if this continues, their livelihoods will become unsustainable, they petitioned the government. The salt farmer representatives Shang Cailian, Tu Juxiu, Lu Wenrong, Shen Chengzhao, Wang Xizheng, and six others arrived in Shanghai from Yuyao on the morning of the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, they petitioned the Shaoxing Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai on Avenue Edward VII, requesting assistance. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they presented a petition to Zhu Tingqi, the Director-General of the Salt Revenue Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance at No. 18 The Bund. Feng Ruliang, the Chief Inspector, met with them on Zhu's behalf, listened to the salt farmers' complaints, and promised to relay the information to Director-General Zhu for appropriate action. He accepted the petition, and the representatives then took their leave.</p>
<p>The Petition</p>
<p>We, the salt farmers of Yuyao salt farms, numbering approximately 100,000, have always made salt as our profession, living in peace and harmony. However, this spring, the two major salt merchants in eastern and western Zhejiang formed an association in Hangzhou and secretly made an alliance to link transportation areas to greatly suppress salt prices. Because suppressing prices was not enough, they deliberately refused to collect salt, disregarding the lives of the salt farmers. For several months, the people have been cut off from their livelihood and have repeatedly appealed to all parties to petition. Unexpectedly, Commissioner Zhou only listened to the salt merchants and hastily issued a notice on October 5th of this year ordering salt to be collected at a 40% discount. The people were even more alarmed and continued to appeal by letter and telegram, but the salt merchants were powerful and influential, and there was no result. Pitiful are we</p>
<p>Weak and Small Salt Farmers</p>
<p>Crying to heaven but receiving no response, banging our heads on the ground but finding no spirit. In order to prevent the salt merchants from exploiting the salt farmers, the government has established restrictions. Each pan is required to produce 381 catties per year (formerly known as 300 catties), and full payment must be made, with no shortage on either side. This has been a fixed rule for sixty years and has never been changed (omitted). Reducing the amount of salt by 40% would allow the salt farmers to freely transport it to the tax collection points for sales after paying taxes, so the salt farmers' livelihoods could still be maintained. If we allow the salt merchants to slaughter us to fulfill their desires, then in a few years, there will be no salt farmers left. Now we are suffering from hunger and cold, and there is no way to appeal. We have specially sent representatives to visit your esteemed director and petition, to submit everything and attach a written statement of reasons. We respectfully request your kindness to provide relief and strictly order the abolition of the evil precedent of a 40% reduction in quota, and still collect salt at the full amount according to the regulations, in order to save the people's lives and maintain national taxes. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. Presented to Director-General and Chief Inspector Feng of the Salt Revenue Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs on Doubts Regarding Stamp Duty on Returned Goods Slips</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Nanyang Candle and Soap Factory yesterday, instructing on doubts regarding stamp duty on returned goods slips, stating: "We received your letter of the 21st of this month, inquiring whether stamp duty should be affixed to returned goods slips. The Chamber had previously received a similar inquiry from another business and forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. The Ministry of Finance replied that there is no explicit provision in the stamp tax law regarding stamp duty on returned goods slips, so it is not necessary to affix stamp duty. However, if the business, after receiving the returned goods, affixes its store stamp on the returned goods slip and returns the slip to the person returning the goods as proof that the returned goods have been received, then it becomes a receipt for goods under Article 16, Section 2, of the Stamp Tax Law, and stamp duty should be affixed accordingly, and it cannot be considered a returned goods slip. The returned goods slip is the responsibility of the person returning the goods, and the slip is also kept by the store to which the goods are returned. If the store receiving the returned goods affixes its stamp and returns it to the person returning the goods, then the nature of the slip has indeed changed to a receipt. The distinction lies in this point, and your factory should handle it carefully when using it, etc."</p>
<h3>Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui's Relief Efforts in Hubei Province Reportedly Completed in Tianmen, Currently Inspecting Relief Efforts in Zhongxiang</h3>
<p>The Renji Road Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui (Chinese and Foreign Relief Association) believes that the number of relief workers for this disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi is relatively small. Therefore, for the areas along the Yangtze River, except for the relief efforts in Tianmen in cooperation with the Jisheng Hui (Relief Society), all other efforts are jointly carried out with the Red Swastika Society. The following is a report from the association's dispatched commissioner, Zheng Shouchang: "It has been found that the relief work in Tianmen has been fully completed and finally concluded. Statistics show that there are a total of 5,717 households in the first district, with 223,59 large mouths and 103,18 small mouths.

We are working quickly with Captain Hu and the members of the Red Swastika Society to provide urgent relief to save the people from their suffering. It has been found that the county is divided into ten districts, with the first, second, sixth, and ninth districts being the most severely affected. The first and second districts are the worst, with houses and fields washed away by the water everywhere. It is truly unbearable to witness.</p>

<h3>Wang Yangshan Detained by Police for Buying Silver Dollars.</h3>

The day before yesterday evening, Wang was asking a shopkeeper in Xiaodongmen if he had silver dollars to exchange for paper money, but he was overheard by a patrol officer, who immediately stepped forward to arrest him. 329 yuan in paper money prepared for buying silver dollars was found on Wang's person. He was immediately taken to the Yemiao Police Station under the jurisdiction, where Director Liu interrogated him. Wang confessed that he was 35 years old and lived at 24 Yuqingli, outside Xiaobeimen. He used to work as a clerk in a money shop. He stammered about why he passed Xiaodongmen. Because the case involved buying silver dollars, violating the government's ban, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Armed Clashes Between Police and Bandits Occurred Near Jinghu Road's Huangdu for Consecutive Nights. Six Bandits Attempted to Rob Road Police of Firearms. Two Road Police Shot and Wounded, but Their Lives Are Not in Danger.</h3>
<p>The Jinghu Road (Shanghai-Nanjing Railway) is the only main line for entering and exiting the capital. At ordinary times, officials and dignitaries from China and abroad pass by in an endless stream. In order to maintain the safety of traffic, the road authorities recently organized a joint patrol of industrial police, relaying road signs along the entire line every night without stopping, and the defense can be said to be very tight. However, on the nights of the 20th and 21st, bandits were found near Huangdu Station on the road, engaging in armed clashes with the road police, resulting in one road policeman being shot and wounded. As this concerns the safety of the railway, the detailed information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Searching the Road at Night</p>
<p>Police and Bandits Clash</p>
<p>At about 8:00 p.m. on the 20th, Zhao Xuemin, a road patrol police officer near the 25-kilometer mark of Huangdu Station, was patrolling the road when he suddenly encountered six bandits. Two of them were each holding a box cannon, and all were wearing blue cloth short jackets and trousers. One of the bandits first spoke in a northern accent, asking the police officer what he was doing, and then ordered him to surrender his gun. The police officer knew that he had encountered bandits and quickly opened fire. The two sides then engaged in a fight. The police officer was shot twice and ran out of bullets. He was then hugged around the waist by a bandit. The police officer struggled desperately and threw his gun into the muddy ditch beside the road.</p>
<p>Military Police Join the Arrest</p>
<p>No Trace of Bandits</p>
<p>At that moment, a night train passed by, and the police officer blew his whistle frantically. The bandits failed to find the gun and fled with shouts. After a while, the Huangdu police and the security team of military police received the alarm and rushed to assist. They saw Officer Zhao lying in a pool of blood. They immediately provided emergency treatment and sent him to the station to take a train to Shanghai for treatment. At the same time, they searched for the bandits and pursued them in all directions. At about 9:00 p.m., Zhong Jianhun, the section chief of the Shanghai North Station Road Police Section, received a report and immediately dispatched several armed police officers, opened a special police car and rushed to the scene, and joined the military police to encircle and arrest them. He also personally went to contact the local garrison and surrounded all the nearby villages on all sides. Early in the morning of the 21st, he entered the villages to search, but found nothing. The police officers dispatched that night to block the bandits along the Shanghai-Xiangshan line also reported the next morning that they had not found any trace of the bandits.</p>
<p>Wounded Police Officer Out of Danger</p>
<p>Lost Gun Recovered</p>
<p>After being sent to the Two Roads Hospital, the wounded police officer Zhao Xuemin's injuries did not change. He was shot twice, once in the left arm and once in the right leg, but his life was not in danger. It is heard that the police officer is a native of Wuzhou, Guangxi, and is 27 years old. He served as a squad leader in the Seventh Army and has extraordinary strength. Therefore, this time he fought against six bandits and was not harmed. It has been found that the pistol thrown into the mud ditch by the police officer at the time has been recovered. Therefore, the road police section chiefs have praised the police officer's brave road protection. The strength of the Huangdu area has also been increased in order to eliminate bandit police incidents at any time.</p>
<p>Bandits Reappear</p>
<p>Security Remains Tight</p>
<p>It was learned that at 12:30 a.m. on the 21st, bandits were still found in the Huangdu area the night before, and there were gunshots fired by bandits at the original location. Fortunately, the police and military police stationed there immediately concentrated and fired back. The bandits were unable to succeed. It has been found that the Jinghu Road has always been peaceful, but in recent years, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, bandits have proliferated and there is unrest everywhere. Now, in order to curb the source of the disaster, the road police affairs section has, in addition to increasing police force, also informed the elders and village chiefs along the line that if they encounter anyone with suspicious behavior or speaking with a foreign accent, they should immediately report it in order to eliminate the source of the bandits.</p>

<h3>Foreign Monk Zhao Kong Sues Russian Newspaper for Defamation, Requesting Compensation of 10,000 Yuan Due to Publication of His Biography.</h3>
<p>Stateless Buddhist foreign monk Zhao Kong, originally named Szelo Berchol Lincoln, 57 years old this year, originally from Hungary, has been residing in Shanghai recently, lecturing and teaching, and promoting Buddhism. The Russian Zira Evening News (located in the Russian Trust Bank branch building) at 774 Avenue Joffre in this city published a news item on August 3 this year, which stated that Szelo Berchol Lincoln served as a military detective in Abyssinia, supplied military weapons, that he was the son of a poor Polish merchant, that he was formerly a Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, Germany, and finally came to China as a monk, and became a Buddhist, that after the European War, he had nowhere to stay in Europe, and went to India to help the Bolshevik Party work, inciting peace in the Far East, etc. After Zhao Kong read it, he believed that the newspaper published this item without reason, intending to damage his reputation. Therefore, he hired Russian lawyer Shu Shengni to file a complaint, accusing the manager of Zira Evening News, Russian Li Biqi, and the editor, Russian Weis (said to be female), of defamation under Article 310, Section 2 of the Criminal Code in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, requesting that they be investigated according to law, and incidentally filing a civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendants be ordered to compensate for losses of 10,000 yuan, etc. According to the complaint, the court, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, ordered a summons by Judge Sun Penghuan from Criminal Division 2. The plaintiff appeared through his lawyer, and there was a disciple of Zhao Kong who spoke French, wore a Chinese monk's robe, and had incense scars on his head, who went to the court to listen to the trial. The defendants appeared through Chinese lawyer Jiang Guofang, stating that defendant Li Biqi was ill, and Weis was sleeping in the morning due to her editing duties and work in the evening, so she did not appear in court. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the purpose of the lawsuit, stating that the article published by Zira Evening News had 12 points that defamed the plaintiff's reputation, requesting an investigation, etc. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendants did not maliciously publish this article, but reprinted it from a Latvian French newspaper published in Geneva. Before publishing this article, the plaintiff had been to the newspaper office and talked about his impending retirement. Later, the newspaper saw this bizarre article and found it very strange, so it reprinted it and added an explanation, stating that they had seen the Zhao Kong monk in Shanghai a week ago, which was beneficial to the plaintiff. At this point, the court, because both parties had not appeared in court, ordered both lawyers to inform their clients that they must appear in court themselves at the next hearing and adjourned the hearing to 9:30 a.m. on the 29th of this month for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Winter Rainstorm, Strange Yangtze River Flooding Event, Rare in 20 Years, Two Vessels Caused Trouble Due to Tidal Surge, Large Quantities of Grain Being Transported</h3>
<p>Since the 16th of this month, heavy rains have been continuous in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, followed by rainstorms. In previous years, by mid-November, the water level of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River had greatly decreased, and large-scale river vessels could no longer navigate to ports such as Shashi, Yichang, Chongqing, and Changsha, but could only switch to shallow-draft vessels. This was the so-called dry season. This year is very different. In the past week, the water level has been rising instead of decreasing due to the combined effects of heavy rain and rainstorms. This is a rare event that has not been seen in 20 years, and ocean liners can still navigate to the upper reaches.</p>
<p>Vessels Cause Trouble</p>
<p>Due to the continuous heavy rains in the Yangtze River, commercial vessels have caused trouble. The Xing Shi vessel of the Sanbei Company, which has a very large tonnage and a deep draft, is usually difficult to navigate in the Xiangjiang River. This time, it sailed from Changsha to Jiujiang and arrived at Xunpu on the 19th. Just as it was raining heavily and windy, it wanted to dock at the China Merchants Wharf and damaged the pontoon boat, which was caused by the impact of the wind and rain. In addition, the Songpu vessel damaged a lightship set up by the Jianghan Customs at the Cement Channel, also due to the impact of the rainstorm. Fortunately, the damage was minor, so compensation was paid and the matter was settled.</p>
<p>Grain Transportation</p>
<p>The transportation of grain on the Yangtze River was suspended for a few days. Recently, grain merchants have telegraphed for large quantities to be loaded in Shanghai. Therefore, since the 21st of this month, they have been rushing to load. The Songpu vessel is heading east with a huge amount of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains loaded. Other companies' Yangtze River vessels are also starting to load grain. Within the next three or four days, a large amount of grain will be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Companies Implement Winter Precautions Early, Following Past Practice, Ending in March of Next Year. Winter Precaution Expenses Shared by Shipping Companies.</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Sanbei, Ningshao, Dada, Datong, Pingan, Daxing, Hezong, Maoli, Lian'an, Huxing, Ruian, Jufeng, Chongming, and other shipping companies in this city, in view of the arrival of winter and the prevalence of pirates, in order to maintain navigation and protect the safety of passengers, have met and decided to implement winter precautions early in accordance with past practice, ending at the end of March next year. During the winter precaution period, it was decided to contact the Public Security Bureau to increase armed police patrols at the docks and dispatch undercover agents to inspect suspicious passengers before the vessels set sail to prevent pirates from entering. All expenses will be shared by the shipping companies.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Launches Simple Life Insurance. Launched Simultaneously in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan on the 2nd of Next Month. Inviting All Sectors to Visit and Report on Benefits and Significance.</h3>

It has been decided that Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan will be launched simultaneously on December 2. Other postal areas in seven provinces and cities will be implemented on March 1 next year.

<h3>Broadcasting Industry Association Pays Attention to Broadcasting Programs, Submits a Request to the Telecommunications Bureau for Approval of Broadcasting Materials, Notifies Colleagues to Submit New Programs for Review</h3>
<p>The Private Broadcasting Industry Association, in order to pay attention to the wording and materials of its colleagues' broadcasts, so as to improve and perfect them, so as not to affect good social customs, and to achieve the effect of auxiliary education, in addition to notifying each member radio station that all new programs and their broadcasting materials should be sent to the association at any time for submission to the International Telecommunications Bureau, together with the Municipal Education Bureau for review, it has also sent a total of 61 broadcasting drafts and instructions for review since August of the 23rd year, of which only two have been approved by the International Telecommunications Bureau, and the rest have not been returned. Therefore, we once again request the competent authority, the International Telecommunications Bureau, to immediately approve the results of the review, so that each radio station has something to follow.</p>
<h3>Second Landlords Subletting Surplus Rooms for the Establishment of Opium Dens; Once Discovered, They Will Be Severely Punished Equally</h3>
<p>During the period of automatic registration, the Public Security Bureau immediately planned to draw salaries from the bottom of the pot for the prohibition of smoking, ordering all second landlords in the city to issue a statement, proving that there were no smokers living in the household, and no one was renting a house to open an opium den. If there is any false report, they must bear full responsibility. Now, in order to further plan for better methods, the second landlord is responsible for ensuring that each household renting a house does not have an opium den. If a landlord rents a house for someone to open an opium den, as a place to swallow clouds and spit fog, once discovered, the landlord and the person who set up the den are both criminals and will be severely punished to prevent future troubles and to achieve the effect of punishing one to warn a hundred. Therefore, in the future, smokers will have nowhere to smoke, and they will inevitably feel insecure. The goal of prohibiting smoking and eliminating smokers in the city can be expected to be achieved.</p>
<h3>One Perpetrator of Eight-Year-Old Assassination Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhao Chunquan (nickname "Maomao"), the chief foreman of the Gongyi Yarn Factory on Roberts Road in West Shanghai, was shot and assassinated unsuccessfully in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The petty foreman Gu Xiaosanzi also died on the spot. After eight years, the authorities had not captured the perpetrator. Ji Yuanpu, the captain of the Detective Brigade of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Wang Huibai, the deputy captain, received a tip-off that the perpetrator, Gu Fafa, a local, now 38 years old, lived at No. 4 Dingkang Lane, Caojiadu, and had now returned home secretly. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, they sent detectives to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau, together with Zhuang Dexiu, the captain of the Detective Squad, Xin Jingsheng, the deputy captain, and detectives Gu Jinshui and Chen Liangfu, disguised themselves and waited in the Tiger Stove in Yutang Lane for a long time while sipping tea. Gu Fafa strolled over and was arrested by the detectives. He was immediately taken to the main brigade for interrogation and to pursue the remaining escaped perpetrators for questioning.</p>
<h3>Shi Jiurong Case: Kidnappers' Trial Concluded, Sentencing Set for the 28th</h3>
<p>Shi Jiurong, a Ningbo native and director of the sales department of the American-owned American Motors Company at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Meyer Road, was suddenly kidnapped by three or four kidnappers at 9:00 AM on April 18th of this year, when he arrived at the office by his own car from home. The attempted kidnapping was discovered by a Russian mechanic at the entrance of the American Motors Company and Indian police officers managing the traffic lights, so the kidnapping failed. The kidnappers got out of the car and fired shots, scattering and fleeing. One of the bandits, named Tian Dazhongzi, fled to Julai Road, and was shot and killed by patrolmen because he resisted arrest by firing a gun. After the incident occurred, it was not until recently that Tian Zonglang, the younger brother of the deceased kidnapper, Tian Dazhong, reported to the French Patrol Room that his brother Tian Dazhong had been invited out by Zhang Sanjiuzi of Funing, but he did not know that he was colluding in kidnapping, which led to his brother's tragic death. He requested an investigation, so Jin Jiulin, the inspector of the French Patrol Room, and detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, Zhou Bingcheng, and other detectives, arrested Zhang Sanjiuzi on September 24th. It was discovered that Zhang had committed theft in the Public Concession in the 16th year of the Republic of China and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Not long after his release, he committed kidnapping again. He was sent to the Special No. 2 Court for questioning. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Chief Judge Zhu Gangxu of the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court came to Criminal Division No. 1 to interrogate him. The defendant vehemently denied that he had colluded with Tian Dazhong to kidnap. After the court summoned witnesses, including the owner of Zhang's car apartment and Shi Jiurong's driver, for questioning, the court believed that the facts were clear and ordered a debate. The police lawyer Yao Zhaodi and the lawyer appointed to defend the defendant debated each other. The court then announced the end of the trial and set the sentencing for the 28th. The defendant was still sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Salmon and Stealing Weight, Tax Evasion Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Local Court Continued Hearing Chang Junfa Describe Scenes of Fraud</p>
<p>Salted fish merchants Weng Zhaofang, Ye Zhenchang, Zheng Yunsheng, Zhang Benhua, Ye Zhenqin, etc., were recently sued by Zhu Xusheng, Chang Junfa, Zhao Lianfang, etc., to the Procuratorate of the Local Court, confessing that Weng, etc., fraudulently obtained money and evaded national taxes. They took advantage of the opportunity of various fish shops to order 50,000 dan of salmon from Suwo Helping Society foreign company, and took the opportunity to instigate the confessors and eight trained small workers to cheat during the weighing process, stealing a total of 6,700 dan, worth more than 70,000 yuan. The prosecutor Lei Binzhang conducted a clear investigation and prosecuted the Criminal Court under Article 339, Paragraph 2. Judge Wu Deying has held several joint trials, but the case has not been concluded due to its complexity. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that this case was reopened by Judge Wu in the third court at 2:00 PM yesterday for further hearing. The defendants Weng Zhaofang, etc., and the confessors Zhu Xusheng, etc., all complied with the summons to appear in court. The judge briefly questioned each defendant, and then Zhu Xusheng testified that the manifest of the goods was copied by Zhang Benhua. When Zhang Benhua was questioned, he flatly denied it. The judge ordered Zhang Benhua to copy the manifest in court in order to verify the handwriting. Then, Chang Junfa testified that he was a small foreman at the wharf and was instructed by Mr. Ye to summon 32 small workers, totaling 16 carriers, divided into four holds, with four carriers in each hold, and each carrier carrying three boxes of salmon. If each carrier weighed 360 to 370 pounds, if cheating occurred, the weight would be reduced to only 300 pounds or so. When Chang Junfa testified, he described the situation of cheating at that time in great detail. The judge obtained the confession, and for the sake of caution, he still needs to summon witnesses for a joint interrogation and verification. Therefore, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Immoral Monk and Lecherous Woman's No Small Offense: Guanyin Temple Visit to Delightful Meditation, Admission of Three Years of Commuting Unashamedly, Immoral Monk Sentenced to Five Months, Lecherous Woman Detained for Three Months</h3>
<p>Ren Ci, a monk of Guanyin Temple on Ou Jia Road, originally from Jiangbei, with the secular name Chen Ruhai, is only 30 years old. Not only are his six senses not exhausted, but his blood is also very vigorous. As the Shanghai dialect says, there are so-called "flowery monks" who, in addition to chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha, are also good at singing various lewd and vulgar songs in the Jiangbei tune. These flowery monks often seek a smile from benefactors, and after chanting scriptures, they sing "Jiangbei Capturing Zhang Sanlang Alive," which can be said to be extremely unethical. And Ren Ci is indeed of the same ilk as the flowery monks, with a frivolous demeanor and a great love for women. When Guanyin Temple was formerly located in Xinyi Lane, Xujiahui Road, it was adjacent to Jin, the wife of Li Jiushan, a fellow villager, who was inherently lewd. After the monk slightly seduced her, she formed an intimate relationship with him, and often took the opportunity to go to the monk's room to visit Delightful Meditation. Later, when the temple moved to its current location, Jin was still passionate about the affair. She waited for Li to go out, no matter how late, and went to meet him secretly. Ren Ci was originally a poor monk, wearing straw sandals and a patchwork robe, and his face was covered with pockmarks, but Jin did not hesitate to condescend and did not care about her husband's labor (Li was a rickshaw puller). Seeing that Li had wages and bought rice, she would definitely find a way to carry the rice and money to the temple to fulfill her wish to provide for the monk and to fulfill the appointment of Sangpu. This kind of action has been going on for three years. Recently, Li finally heard about it, and because he was unwilling to wear a green hat for a long time, he decided to deal with it. Coincidentally, Jin left home again the night before last. Li waited until midnight but still did not see her return, so he reported to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and sent detective Wang Jinshou to rush to the temple with Li. It was early morning, and the pair of wild mandarin ducks were still sound asleep. Wang and other detectives suddenly broke into the room, and they were startled awake, but there was no way to escape. They had no choice but to put on their clothes and be bound. Wang and other detectives searched the room and found a photo of Ren Ci and Jin together, and took them back to the police station together, separately detaining them until yesterday morning, when they were sent to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Zhan Liangce interrogated them, and the police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a complaint of adultery, requesting punishment according to Article 239 of the Criminal Law. When the two defendants were questioned, they bowed their heads and admitted that they had been having an affair for three years. Judge Zhan interrogated them and sentenced Ren Ci to five months in prison and Li Jin to three months in prison as a warning.</p>

<h3>Rent Dispute in Lishui Lane, Danshui Road Involves Litigation, Landlord and Tenant Hold Conflicting Views</h3>
<p>The lawyer Tao Wuzhi, from Suzhou, and his rent collector Pan Qipeng, were recently privately prosecuted by Zheng Haiting, a Cantonese tenant, for forging documents and defaming his reputation in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, with a lawyer representing him. After Judge Li Changnian of the Special No. 2 Court opened a court session to summon them, Tao and Pan not only submitted a defense but also filed a counterclaim for false accusation and defamation, requesting the court to order the defendant in the counterclaim to compensate them for their loss of reputation by one yuan each and to publish an apology to restore their reputation. After the hearing, it was rescheduled for another hearing. It has already been recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Li opened the court again for a continued hearing. The private prosecutor Zheng Haiting, because he did not understand the Shanghai dialect, went to court with his son Zheng Xiaofeng and his representing lawyer. The defendants also went to court with their defense lawyer, Zhang Shizhao. First, the private prosecutor said that he had rented a house at No. 11 Lishui Lane, Danshui Road for many years, and the rent was 52 yuan per month. At the end of last year, the landlord wanted to renovate the house, and the tenants asked to extend the lease and increase the rent to 67 yuan. Because I thought the amount was too expensive and not worth it, I verbally agreed to find a house to move out and not participate in the tenants' group, so I did not sign a contract with the defendants. Later, in mid-April of this year, I found a house and paid off the rent and moved out. The other tenants agreed to increase the rent to 67 yuan and signed a contract. They also signed a separate contract for repaying half a month's rent each month. Later, the defendant suddenly filed a lawsuit in your court's Civil Division, accusing me of owing rent. The first trial failed, and the appeal to the High Sub-Court suddenly produced a contract as evidence. Pan Qipeng also went to court to give false testimony, saying that I had signed this contract and that I had moved privately. I did not sign this contract. It was obviously forged by the defendants. Saying that I moved privately was intentional to damage my reputation. When I moved, I hired Zhongfu Moving Company, from 8:00 AM to 4:00 or 5:00 PM, making three or four trips back and forth. At 11:00 AM that day, Pan Qipeng came, and I returned the key to him. Moreover, there was a caretaker in the lane, how could I move privately? I request an investigation, etc. Tao Wuzhi testified that all 23 tenants signed contracts. The private prosecutor had fulfilled the new rent for four months and paid the new rent, so he gave him the new rent tickets for January to April. The old rent had not been paid from September to December. Because he moved privately, he filed a lawsuit to recover the rent. This contract was written by the private prosecutor and handed over to the rent collector to bring back. In the beginning, the blank contract was written in the first paragraph by the rental office and handed over to the rent collector to be distributed to the tenants to sign and stamp on the back themselves. He also presented the contracts of all the tenants as evidence. He also testified that the private prosecutor made false accusations and requested a clear judgment to allow the counterclaim. Pan Qipeng testified that the contract was sent by me to each tenant. At that time, it was sent to the private prosecutor's place, but the private prosecutor was not at home, so it was sent to the Public Works Bureau and handed to his son. Later, I also collected it from his son. Every month, I went to the Public Works Bureau to collect the room rent from his son. The private prosecutor did not notify me when he moved. He moved out privately and continuously. It was not until the caretaker saw that there was no one in the house and reported to me to watch. The door was closed, and knocking on the door did not answer. He went to the Public Works Bureau to ask the private prosecutor's son, who replied that he had moved out and handed me the key. One day, I went to open the door to look and saw only three old military beds left in the house, and nothing else, etc. The court verified the testimonies, and since both sides held their own ground, it was announced that it would be rescheduled for a further hearing on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Grandmother and Granddaughter Poisoned</h3>
<p>Grandmother Takes Poison Due to Prolonged Illness, Attempting Suicide, Granddaughter Accidentally Drinks It, Both Suffer Poisoning Simultaneously</p>
<p>Wu Li, a Ningbo woman, 49 years old, lived at No. 103 Yuanji Lane, Tangshan Road. Because she was weak and often ill, she was always near the medicine stove. Therefore, she was very resentful. Recently, she had been ill for a long time and could not get up. She tossed and turned in bed, suffering unspeakable pain, which led to the thought of ending her life. Suddenly, at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, she privately soaked raw opium in boiling water, added sugar, and drank half a bowl of it, covering herself with a blanket to sleep, hoping to commit suicide. It did not take effect. The woman's granddaughter, Xiaomei, 19 years old, woke up from a nap beside her. Because she was thirsty for a moment, she vaguely saw half a bowl of poisonous substance in the bowl, thinking it was tea, and drank it all in one gulp. Therefore, before long, both the grandmother and granddaughter suffered poisoning at the same time, and screamed for help due to abdominal pain. Fortunately, her family and neighbors heard the screams and came. After learning the situation, they rushed the two to the hospital for treatment. Their condition was very critical.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Thanks Friends and Relatives, Donates Banquet Funds of 1,000 Yuan to Flood Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, celebrated his 60th birthday the day before yesterday. Various parties sent birthday gifts, totaling more than 5,315 yuan. All of this money has been successively delivered to the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces to distribute to various provinces for disaster relief. Mr. Lin also believes that the kindness and compassion of all parties should be repaid with a banquet. However, half of them are friends and relatives from other places, making it difficult to invite them all to a banquet. Therefore, it was decided to donate 1,000 yuan of banquet funds to flood relief, both to benefit the disaster victims and to benefit friends and relatives, so that one action can accomplish several good deeds at once.</p>
<h3>Family Exhibition Extended for Two Days</h3>
<p>The Family Exhibition was originally scheduled to last for ten days and close on Sunday evening, the 24th. Because the exhibition has been very popular since its opening, those participating in the exhibition and the Meilingden Company have agreed to extend the exhibition for two days, namely the 25th and 26th, adding special exhibits that are very worth seeing. Those who want to improve their home equipment should not miss this opportunity to go and see it. In addition, the exhibition does not charge admission fees for visitors, which has led to a continuous stream of visitors and a great deal of crowding. It has now been decided that on the 25th and 26th, each visitor will be charged an admission fee of five cents and will be given a catalog, so that they can visit quietly without the burden of crowding. This is also a new feature since the opening.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Movement in West Shanghai District to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The market in this city is sluggish, and the economy is in panic. Citizens are all feeling the burden of expensive rents. Therefore, there are rent reduction movements, such as in the Nanshi, Pudong, and Chanbei districts, where rent reduction associations have been established. However, there is no corresponding organization in West Shanghai. It is heard that many tenants in the district have taken the initiative to launch a campaign, and preparations have been completed. It is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at the Shidai Primary School in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 24th). All lanes in the Yuexi district can send representatives to attend on time.</p>
<h3>Chen Yuanqin Invents Cashmere</h3>
<p>A factory is established in Yangshupu to weave as much goods as possible to meet the needs of the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yuanqin, a member of the industrial community in this city, saw that all cashmere products sold in the country were foreign goods, resulting in an annual loss of seven or eight million yuan. Domestically produced products are still lacking. In order to promote domestic goods and recover rights, he has carefully studied and repeatedly tried weaving. He has also traveled abroad twice for inspection. Now, he has invented cashmere and a type of cashmere wool that is flat. He has also raised funds to establish the China Woolen Textile Factory, located between Linqing Road in Yangshupu, which is large in scale. It is reported that the factory has already opened and is weaving the product as much as possible to meet the needs of society.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Schedules a Meeting with Bouncing Opera Performers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in order to convene a meeting with all the bouncing opera performers in this city, specially issued an order yesterday to Bai Yushuang and others from the Empire Theater and Ai Lianjun and others from the North China Pingju Troupe, saying that opera is a tool for promoting social education and is closely related to national culture. Therefore, anything that is sufficient to affect good social customs is absolutely prohibited. It has been repeatedly reported that the content of bouncing opera is quite inappropriate, and the singing, dialogue, and movements of the actors are especially lewd. It should have been banned altogether. However, in consideration of the livelihoods of the actors, an opportunity for improvement is granted. Therefore, it is scheduled to convene a meeting with all the bouncing opera performers in this city at the lecture hall of the Municipal People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road, Nanshi, at 10:00 AM on the 28th of this month (Thursday) to guide them on the points that should be improved. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered that the members concerned be on time to the place of hearing, without delay. This order is essential.</p>

<h3>The Glory of China's Medical Community: Zhang Xiqi Returns Home with Honors, Proposal of Ophthalmology Surgery Cases and Statistics Gains Attention of Japanese Ophthalmology Community</h3>
<p>The Kyushu Medical Congress of Japan held its 37th Medical Congress in Kagoshima, Japan, in the middle of last month. More than 500 people attended, all of whom were authorities in the Japanese medical community, and invited Wu Xiangfeng, Dean of the Medical College of the National Peking University of China, and Zhang Xiqi, Professor of the Southeast Medical College of Shanghai and Dean of the Guanghua Eye Hospital, to participate. Zhang Xiqi, an authority in China's ophthalmology community, reported a total of 11 items at the meeting on new ophthalmological surgical proposals, rare clinical cases, and various statistics obtained from clinical practice and research. The meeting considered it a truly new and major contribution, which proved that China's medical progress was not behind Japan. Zhang also gave a speech at the congress, expressing his great opinions, saying that medicine is a benevolent art, which is the true truth of Wu Yongyuan. For example, Mr. Noguchi Hideyo broke the racial boundaries with a benevolent heart and went to the African black country to study yellow fever, and eventually died in the line of duty. If this spirit is also extended to international politics and economics, then human unity will be close at hand. It is also a needle in the eye of the times. Zhang has now returned to Shanghai and brought with him a variety of medical equipment.</p>

<h3>Germany's "Decimeter Waves"</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>Due to the development of radio, the number of radio stations is increasing daily. The current wavebands are insufficient for allocation, making it difficult to accommodate new stations. Therefore, ultrashort wavebands between five meters and one meter are gradually being explored and put into practical use. "Decimeter Waves" (referring to radio waves between one-tenth of a meter and one meter) have also been secretly and systematically tested by the German Telefunken Co. in the past one or two years and may be put into practical use in the future.</p>
<p>The wavelength of decimeter waves is less than one meter, so the frequency is as high as 300 million cycles or more. Under this high-frequency current, most of the components in ordinary radio equipment are no longer applicable, so they must be manufactured separately for testing.</p>
<p>The transmitter is also specially designed, and the oscillation tube used is a special "Haban Tube," namely, a split-anode magnetron. The circuit of the transmitter and the internal structure of the Haban tube are shown in Figure A. The tube has a cathode, surrounded by a cylindrical anode split into four pieces (as shown in the upper left corner of Figure A). Two opposing pieces are connected with wires and led out of the tube, as shown by the dotted lines in the figure. In use, the anode is connected to a positive voltage, and a strong electromagnet is placed outside the tube. Electrons emitted from the cathode are attracted to the anode by the anode voltage, while being deflected back to the cathode by the external electromagnet, thus creating oscillation and generating radio waves in the oscillation circuit.</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes in the receiver include triodes and diodes, which are also specially manufactured and extremely small in size to minimize the time electrons spend passing through the vacuum tube. Tests show that these diodes can work satisfactorily even with wavelengths as short as 40 centimeters.</p>
<p>During testing, these decimeter waves were used to guide ships into port, with excellent results. In addition, two sets of transceivers using the same wavelength were able to transmit and receive simultaneously at very close distances, reportedly operating independently without interfering with each other.</p>
<p>Figure B shows a portable decimeter wave transmitter and its reflector. Figure C shows the antenna arrangement for a decimeter wave receiver. Figure D shows the Haban vacuum tube with an electromagnet placed outside.</p>
<h3>Overview of Broadcasting Facilities in Europe and America</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools.</p>
<p>The development of radio in modern times has been rapid. However, to achieve good results and significant effects, attention must be paid not only to the broadcasting equipment and radios, but also to the broadcasting facilities, various equipment, and management systems to achieve perfection. This is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly describe the facilities and systems of broadcasting stations in Europe and America. Given the number of broadcasting stations and the popularity of radios in Shanghai, this may serve as a reference.</p>
<p>Broadcasting stations in Europe and America, recognizing that broadcasting equipment and radios have almost reached perfection, have recently shifted their focus to improving broadcasting studio equipment.</p>
<p>The most important aspects of broadcasting studio construction are: First, it must be completely insulated from external sounds and noise. Second, it must maintain good sound quality for sounds produced inside.</p>
<p>To achieve these two goals, major broadcasting stations in Europe and America have made great efforts. Some use two- to four-inch thick asbestos attached to the four walls, floor, and ceiling of the broadcasting studio (such as the N.BC. broadcasting studio in New York, USA), while others use wood blocks (such as the Leipzig broadcasting station in Germany). Some even use hydraulic presses to open and close the doors of the broadcasting studio to appropriately adjust the degree of "reverberation."</p>
<p>As for the structure of broadcasting studios, it varies according to the system. The New World and European countries have different approaches.</p>
<p>In many broadcasting stations in the United States, in addition to broadcasting for listeners to listen to, the public is allowed to enter the broadcasting studio to listen to the broadcast directly. For a ticket costing just four cents, anyone can enter. Therefore, broadcasting studios in the United States can accommodate more than 2,000 direct listeners. Broadcasting studios that can accommodate one or two hundred people are very common. To prevent noise and interference from the audience, these broadcasting studios are often specially enclosed with glass to separate the performance stage, so that the performers' various movements and expressions can be seen but the sound cannot be heard directly. The music performed in the glass room is transmitted to the audience outside the glass room using a special "sound amplifier." This sound amplifier can only transmit the music from the glass room and does not allow noise from the audience outside to enter. Therefore, even with thousands of listeners, the radio broadcast is not affected in any way. It is said that there are about 30 radio broadcasting stations in the United States with this type of glass-enclosed broadcasting studio.</p>
<p>The situation is the opposite in the British dominions. Although they also pay attention to the construction of broadcasting studios and strive to improve them, they generally do not allow people to enter the broadcasting studio to listen directly, except for those with special relationships. Therefore, their broadcasting studios naturally do not need to be built on such a grand scale as those in the United States. As for the glass room in the broadcasting studio, they consider it a "useless object."</p>
<p>As for the power used by broadcasting stations, the United States and Europe are also the opposite.</p>
<p>In the United States, because it is less affected by radio waves from other countries, most broadcasting stations use about 100 watts of power, with more than 600 such stations. Stations with 50 kilowatts or more are rare, with only about 20 such stations nationwide. Recently, Cincinnati has built a powerful 500-kilowatt broadcasting station, but its performance is questionable.</p>
<p>The situation in Europe is the opposite. Because the countries of Europe are connected and close to each other, international broadcasting competition is naturally fierce. Therefore, their broadcasting stations mostly use high power. For example, the Soviet Union has broadcasting stations with 500 kilowatts of power, and about 20 stations with 100 kilowatts or more. France has six or seven broadcasting stations with 100 kilowatts. Italy has also built a 500-kilowatt station to compete. Therefore, the competition for high-power broadcasting is very fierce in Europe.</p>
<p>As for commercial advertising in broadcasting, it is prevalent in the commercial country of the United States. There are even companies specializing in soliciting and negotiating radio advertising. On the European side, advertising broadcasting is rare, and in some cases, nonexistent.</p>
<p>In addition, there are various special broadcasting stations. For example, there is a broadcasting station outside Paris that specializes in broadcasting music that suits the tastes of the British, and most of its listeners are British residents in Britain. Furthermore, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and other countries have established shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast strongly to their colonies to facilitate their imperialist aggression policies. The colonies of European and American countries are mostly far from their home countries, so ordinary broadcasting stations cannot be effective and strong shortwave broadcasting is necessary.</p>
<h3>Electrical Power and Electrical Work</h3>
<p>— Enlun</p>
<p>Electric current has a certain working capacity, and the working capacity of the electric current is called electrical energy. The work done by the electric current is called electrical work, and the work done by the electric current per second is called electrical power. Electrical power P is equal to the product of voltage V (volts) and current I (amperes), i.e.,</p>
<p>P = V * I ... (1)</p>
<p>The unit for measuring electrical power is the watt (one watt is the electrical power of one ampere of current at a voltage of one volt). Sometimes multiples of watts are used as larger units of power, such as hectowatts and kilowatts.</p>
<p>1 hectowatt = 100 watts</p>
<p>1 kilowatt = 1000 watts</p>
<p>From equation (1), current I or voltage V can also be obtained from electrical power P.</p>
<p>Ohm's law expresses the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance, and the formula for electrical power expresses the relationship between power, current, and voltage. Both relationships can be represented by a circle, as shown in Figure A for Ohm's law and Figure B for the law of electrical power. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Visit to the China Alcohol Factory (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Huang Youxiong</p>
<p>Alcohol and spirits - The uses of alcohol - The required amount of alcohol in China</p>
<p>The manufacturing of alcohol - A tour of the whole factory - Hopes for the future</p>
<p>(V) A Tour of the Whole Factory</p>
<p>The China Alcohol Factory has its own small steamship to shuttle between Shanghai and Bailianjing to pick up and drop off commissioners and workers. The factory buildings are all built with steel frame and cement, with flat roofs and a magnificent appearance. The factory is divided into three departments: chemical, mechanical, and administrative. The chemical and mechanical departments each have a chief engineer and several assistant managers. The administrative department has Chinese and Western secretaries and several clerks. The total number of mechanics and workers in the factory is only over a hundred, and the factory covers an area of 150 acres, but it can be managed carefully and in an orderly manner. This is certainly due to the complete equipment and the use of machinery for all work, but it also shows the painstaking efforts in planning and design.</p>
<p>The reporters, led by Director Tang himself, first went to the chemical laboratory, which specializes in manufacturing parts of the experiment. Next to it is the culture room and sterilization room, which are responsible for yeast culture. The original yeast is the most important thing in the manufacture of alcohol. The quality of the alcohol produced is closely related to the yeast. Therefore, the factory attaches great importance to it. There are many kinds of yeast, and the room uses glass tubes to store them separately for selection. The factory also requires various raw materials used to undergo small-scale tests before large-scale manufacturing.</p>
<p>Next is the germination room, located on a flat roof covered with glass. Below is the germination tank. The room uses the latest air conditioners, so malt can be produced even when the atmosphere is warm. The purpose of malt is to make the starch in grains and potatoes saccharified.</p>
<p>When grains are used as raw materials to manufacture alcohol, the raw material processing room is extremely important. The room is equipped with a dust removal machine, a dehulling machine, a shell screening machine, and a grinder. Although these are based on the same principles as ordinary rural windmills and mills, the use of modern machinery makes the work faster and more efficient. All transportation uses bag-type or spiral automatic conveyors, eliminating the trouble of manual handling.</p>
<p>Next is the cooking and saccharification room, which mixes grains with malt to saccharify them. It is equipped with high-pressure cooking machines, saccharification machines, and cooling machines. The above rooms are indispensable equipment for manufacturing alcohol using grain starch raw materials. The factory will soon start manufacturing them. When the reporters visited, a large amount of ring bell was placed for storage.</p>
<p>The subsequent visit was to various manufacturing processes using cane molasses as raw material. The factory currently uses molasses imported from Southeast Asia to manufacture alcohol. After the molasses is transported, it is first stored in the storage tank at the factory entrance. When used, it is automatically sent to the dilution room, diluted with water, and stirred evenly with filtered compressed air. The room is equipped with a pure yeast culture device for fermenting grain mash and molasses.</p>
<p>The main process in alcohol manufacturing is fermentation. The factory is equipped with 16 closed fermentation tanks, each with a capacity of 7650 liters. Steam pipes, water pipes, and air pipes are installed inside. Fermentation produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is passed from the top of the tank through a main pipe into the carbon dioxide manufacturing room for the manufacture of dry ice and liquid air.</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in the fermentation room for a while. At that time, fermentation was in progress. When the tank cover was opened, the inside was full of foam, pale yellow, and the smell of alcohol was pungent. The fermentation tanks stand in rows, which is very grand. Each tank is attached with a label, indicating the elapsed time and its temperature, and someone observes it at all times.</p>
<p>Finally, to the distillation room. The distillation machine was made by the British Blair Company and is a continuous distillation refining and purification machine. Engineer Wei told us that when alcohol is distilled, the "head" and "tail" must be separated and purified from the finished product. The so-called head is the alcohol that is initially distilled, which often contains low-boiling aldehydes. The so-called tail is the high-boiling fusel oil that is distilled last. These must be purified, and then the alcohol can be pure and good. The distilled alcohol is then stored in the storage tower outside the storage room.</p>
<p>At this point, the alcohol manufacturing work is completed. Then go downstairs to the canning room to visit. The filling method is generally automatic management, either by volume or by weight, and is very precise and reliable. The factory has storage tanks, each with a capacity of one million liters, which can store about two months of products.</p>
<p>In addition to the above rooms, the factory needs electricity for the operation of various machines. Therefore, it has its own 400-kilowatt generator to supply electricity for all motors and lights in the factory. The factory also needs a large amount of water and steam. Therefore, it has its own well dug 700 feet deep, which can produce 136,500 liters of water per hour. The supply of steam is provided by two water-tube boilers, and the burning of coal and the removal of ash after burning are also done by machinery.</p>
<p>For the safety of the factory, the factory is also equipped with a fire-fighting water pump, driven by a gasoline engine, which can draw 4556 liters of water per minute and can send the water from the Huangpu River to all parts of the factory to prevent fire.</p>
<p>After the visit, the reporter took a photo with Director Tang and expressed his gratitude. He then returned to the hotel by the factory's own steamship. Mr. Wei and Mr. Lin were also able to take the same boat back to Shanghai, and the reporter was able to get the two gentlemen to further explain the working procedures and all the facilities in the factory.</p>
<p>(VI) Hopes for the Future</p>
<p>The China Alcohol Factory has been in operation for only two years since its preparation, and the quality of its products is comparable to that of imported products. Given the urgent need for alcohol in China, it is the most promising business. The reporters' visit, although very brief, did not allow for detailed consultation, but seeing the perfection of its machinery and equipment and the precision of its working procedures is rare in the current industrial world of our country. However, alcohol is a basic raw material for the chemical industry, and it can be as important as acids and bases. The more developed a country's industry is, the more alcohol it needs. If our country's industry continues to develop, the current output of the China Alcohol Factory may still be insufficient to meet the demand, and it needs to be expanded again. Fortunately, the factory has already left room for expansion, which is very easy. In the future, we only hope that the Chinese people can know that China already has domestically produced alcohol and use it consistently, so that the outflow of rights can be avoided.</p>
<p>The China Alcohol Factory currently uses molasses as raw material. The factory has equipment for making alcohol from grains, and grains and potatoes are produced everywhere in our country. In the future, we hope to actively develop, so that all raw materials are made of domestic goods. Not only will the rights not be leaked out, but agricultural products can also have a way out.</p>
<p>Finally, our country has few domestic liquid fuels, and the need for liquid fuels is increasing day by day. Alcohol can replace gasoline, and various countries have proven its success, but its combination components still have room for research. We also hope that the people of the country can rise up and promote and research it, so that its benefits for national defense and transportation cannot be exhausted in one word. (The End)</p>

The high quality, richness, and well-organized arrangement of the exhibition surpass past exhibitions. The exhibition is open for two more days, today and tomorrow. People in Shanghai should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Boy (1)(0)(3)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I know how to do it! Mr. Ha often uses this method! But because I didn't have camphor oil before, I only used a pin," Donn said, then gently dripped a drop on the insect's head. The pair of lake-colored wings vibrated for a moment and then became still. Before this little slaughter was finished, Tandy suddenly shouted from the bedroom, "Oh, the little crabs have come out, the big one has eaten them all." (Note) Xiao Qiao and his aunt went to the rescue, only to see Tandy jumping excitedly on a chair, while two small crabs were crawling around on the floor, having desperately escaped from the wire mesh of the cage. Another one was climbing towards the top of the cage, its life clearly under great threat, because a tragic and fascinating scene was unfolding below. The big crab retreated into a small house in the cage, which was where the Borley water glass used to be, and sat there calmly, eating one of its own kind, completely unmoved. The poor sufferer's claws were all pulled off, its body overturned, its upper shell held in a pincer, close to the big crab's mouth, serving as a plate. Then it used another pincer to scoop out the flesh of the sufferer and ate it leisurely, sometimes turning its strange and protruding eyes from one side to the other, extending a thin tongue to lick those eyes, causing the children to burst into laughter. Madam Shu sent the cage into Donn's room for him to observe this spectacle, while Xiao Qiao collected the escaped soldiers and locked them in an overturned washbasin.</p>
<p>(Note) "鮮" (xiān) is a homophone of the character "蟹" (xiè), meaning crab.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tennis Stars Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng Win Performances in Hong Kong; Wang Wenzheng Defeats Lin Zhen Two Sets to Zero; Qiu and Wang Win Three Straight Against the Lin Zhen Brothers</h3>
<p>Our country's tennis stars Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng, etc., recently departed from Shanghai to compete in Southeast Asia. On the morning of the 16th, they arrived in Hong Kong on the President Jefferson liner. Coincidentally, Helen Wills Moody, the 1930 American junior women's singles and doubles champion, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and traveled south on the same ship to visit the Philippines. Taking advantage of the stopover in Hong Kong, Qiu and the others competed at the Chinese Recreation Club for two days, resulting in complete victories. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin defeated Xu Runpei 6-4</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng defeated Lin Zhen</p>
<p>American female tennis player Helen Wills Moody and He Jialiu played a doubles exhibition against Xu and Qian on the first day (16th). Speaking of the lady’s performance, the forehand shots were excellent, often passing over the net smoothly, with accurate placement and powerful serves, which are her strengths. The footwork was exceptionally agile, with a masculine style in posture and attitude. The backhand was also very good, with occasional strokes of great skill. The overhead smash was also commendable. In the second game, several unforced errors due to her speed gave Qian and Xu the opportunity to tie the score. It is said that the old Wang of the Chinese Recreation Club, once a top-notch singles player, may not be able to beat the lady. In the first singles match, Qian Yaobin played against Xu Runpei. Due to waiting for Wang Wenzheng, an extra game was added. Qian Yaobin's performance was mediocre, and neither side exerted much effort, so there was nothing exciting. The third match was between Wang Wenzheng and AS Lin Zhen, one being the runner-up in the Shanghai hard court tennis singles, and the other being the Hong Kong singles champion. The two heroes fought fiercely, with each set reaching 5-7 or higher. Their skills each had their own strengths. Wang Wenzheng has the nickname "Iron Horse" in Shanghai, known for his running and stamina. His baseline forehand and backhand strokes are his signature moves, and his footwork is very neat and calm, which are his strengths. He always aims and hits hard at the opponent's every shot, never slacking off from beginning to end. The key to his victory lies in this. His weak point is inaccurate slices, and his drop shots are not yet perfect. Therefore, he only hit one good drop shot in two sets. His victory over Lin Zhen was entirely due to the balls he placed left and right with his forehand and backhand, leaving the lively Lin Zhen exhausted. His losses were due to failed slices and drop shots. If Lin Zhen could use his strengths to attack Wang's weaknesses, serving more lobs and inducing Wang to slice and rushing to the net to make drop shots, he could have won the second set. It was already conceivable when he lost four straight games.</p>
<p>Qiu and Wang Also Win in Doubles</p>
<p>The 17th was the second day of the exhibition match, and the number of spectators was no less than the previous day. In the first match, Xu Runpei and Qian Yaobin played a singles match. Qian's performance was better than on the first day, with powerful forehand shots, but otherwise mediocre. It was indeed fortunate that he won fourth place in this year's All-China Games. Xu Hupei performed exceptionally diligently, showing considerable skill in serving and volleying, and defeated Qian Yaobin 2-0. The second match, the doubles between Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng against the Lin Zhen brothers, was the most exciting. Wang's skills are indeed as good as described the previous day. Qiu Feihai's skills are even better than Wang's. His excellent forehand shots are his specialty, and his volleying and low shots are also his forte. He has rich experience and very sharp eyesight, able to discern the height, distance, and whether the opponent's shot is out of bounds at a glance, never missing one. It's a pity that his backhand is weak, with a very sharp angle, often resulting in out-of-bounds shots. His slices are also not yet perfect. There was a reason for his loss to Xu Chengji in this year's All-China Games. In doubles, Wang Wenzheng and he are well-coordinated, and against the Hong Kong doubles champions, the Lin Zhen brothers, they were indeed evenly matched. Therefore, the first set went to as high as 10-8. Both sides showed their full potential. The Lin Zhen brothers are well-coordinated, excelling in running, volleying, and high overheads. Qiu and Wang excel in low shots, baseline shots, accurate shots, and powerful shots. Therefore, they suppressed the ball and lobbed it high, and when the Lin Zhen brothers made high overheads, they hit it horizontally between the two of them, thus winning. Their ability to do so requires a deep understanding of the art of the game. As for the re-performance on Wednesday and Thursday, it can only be decided this afternoon. Whether the trip to Guangzhou will materialize will also be determined in the next day or two, pending a reply from the provincial government.</p>

The market tended to tighten after the opening, with Mobil still settling. The HSBC Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both the British and American markets flat.

<p>Industrial and Commercial Lending Still Faces Difficulties</p>
<p>In recent days, the business of the financial sector has developed slightly. Sound silver and money businesses and commercial firms have been communicating with each other regarding lending and credit transactions, etc., unlike the previous sluggishness. Even large amounts of money are being made complete by any means, and they are also gradually being replenished. Therefore, the recent situation has the appearance of recovery. However, most commercial settlements have not been completely saturated, and small problems have followed one after another. Since our country changed to legal tender, foreign trade has not been willing to use legal tender as the standard. The raw materials for imported goods that are in excess of exports are all rising sharply, regardless of whether they are fast-selling or slow-selling. However, several raw materials for domestic goods must be obtained from foreign countries. Therefore, with the price of raw materials rising, it is difficult to sell finished products cheaply. If you want to increase the value, it is difficult. Therefore, most factories that use foreign raw materials are half-handed and cannot develop. The silver and money industry is subject to various obstacles from foreign firms, so lending is naturally difficult. Special obstacles have also arisen in economic circulation. In addition, the end of the year is not far away, and timid people are mainly shrinking and unwilling to lend as much as possible. As a result, there are many more obstacles in the active money market. The foreign discount rate in the market is based on the old rules, opening at 1 jiao and 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets. The dividend is still white and there is no added water. Check transactions are still moderately simple and complex. The morning market transferred more than 3.4 million, and new transactions were more than 600,000. Afternoon market transactions were more than 100,000, and transactions in small general meetings were more than 800,000. More than 900,000 banknotes were issued in this port, and more than 1.4 million were shipped out. Foreign mortgage transactions were redeemed for more than 500,000, and more than 800,000 were newly made. The private banks' foreign public orders collected and delivered more than 52.2 million, and the foreign dividend orders collected and delivered more than 4.3 million, and various remittance orders more than 400,000. According to news from the bank side, foreign banks collected and delivered more than 3.45 million in bill payments, more than 3.6 million in various commodity exchange mortgages and miscellaneous payments, more than 500,000 in special remittances, more than 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, and more than 200,000 in differential gold settlements. Chinese banks collected and delivered more than 2.9 million in bill payments, more than 4.1 million in various commodity exchange tax mortgages and miscellaneous payments, more than 300,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 400,000 in special remittances, and more than 300,000 in differential gold settlements. Japanese banks collected and delivered more than 2.7 million in bill payments, more than 1 to 2.6 million in various commodity exchange miscellaneous payments, more than 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 300,000 in special remittances, and more than 400,000 in differential gold settlements. Looking at the overall situation, there is still no major rise or fall. The general trend of auxiliary currency is that the flat ocean has not moved, but the secret market is being absorbed and raised by someone. The secret market opened at 12 jiao and 04 li, and the listed price was 11 jiao and 45 points. The afternoon market was 12 jiao and 06 li, and transactions were also rare. Most of them were hoarding and not selling. Only 85,000 jiao were sold yesterday, and 36,000 strings of copper coins were traded, equivalent to 12,000 yuan. In addition, the total number of bills in the Shanghai Clearing House on the 22nd was 1,414,4264 yuan, 8 jiao and 6 fen in national currency, including a total of 1,044,6170 yuan, 0 jiao and 6 fen in total exchange, a total of 1,738,098 yuan, 7 jiao and 7 fen in total collection by the money industry, and 1,959,995 yuan, 4 jiao and 7 fen in others. In addition, the joint reserve committee of the Bankers Association, the public order discount interest rate is 1 jiao and 5 fen per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate is 2 jiao per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Spot Goods Flow Out Daily, Bonds Rise Slightly, Reversal, Lenders Stop Pushing Up Prices Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a slight rebound. Although the financial sector was pushing up prices, the remaining amount above the market price was only a little over 1 yuan for the smaller ones, and only 22 yuan and 22 guan for the largest ones, but it would take more than ten years to pay off. The ordinary ones only had a few yuan to about 11 or 12 yuan left. Therefore, yesterday, the lenders who pushed up prices suddenly stopped, and the flow of spot goods from the masses was indeed not small. Yesterday, only two sessions were done. The morning session did not start shooting until 11:30. The initial shooting of 48 and 78 continued to advance. The demobilization of soldiers rose sharply by 1 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. After entering, 4, 6, 33, 47 and 54, etc. sold extremely rapidly. 19 Shanqi suddenly turned small, falling more and more rapidly. 20 Guan fell by 1 yuan and 3 jiao, but the long side of 16 was still pushing up prices, and the rear column rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao from 22 Guan, but only 5 fen were good for the sixth fast period, and morale had subsided. In the afternoon session, shooting did not start until 5:30. The market price trended downward uniformly. The selling of 4, 33 and 43 was extremely strong, and 16 also sold in the rear column. The market price was reduced by a small number of jiao to 1 yuan and a half, and the current month's 20 Guan was still raised by 8 jiao, and the current month's 96 was raised by 4 jiao. As a result, the demobilization of soldiers and 96 rose by 2, 3 jiao to 1 yuan and a half, and the rest uniformly declined by 3, 4 jiao to 1 yuan or zero. However, this is not a formal decline. The future trend is that even if there is a pull, it will only be a flash in the pan. The decline should still be in the back. The total number of transactions is estimated to be more than 40 million yuan. The following is a table comparing the results of the rise and fall (unit: yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stocks See New High for the Year</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (21st), the New York stock market surged, and the railway stock index and the public utility stock index both rose to new highs for the year. Although railway freight has shown signs of decline due to seasonal factors, railway stocks are extremely strong. The rise in mining stocks is due to increased profits and the sharp decline in foreign gold standard currencies and the strong US dollar. Automobile stocks rose due to improved business, and public utility stocks also rose due to attacks on the Weller Reben case. Stocks on the small exchange rose, and the bond market was very strong. A total of 3.28 million shares were traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left,</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Many Profiteers Cash Out, Yarn Flowers Suddenly Decline in the Afternoon, Extreme Rises and Falls are Quite Startling</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced rapid ups and downs, and the situation once again became volatile. Initially, banks and public bond groups increased their positions, causing market panic and unusual tension. This was because general speculators were overly enthusiastic, bullish on cotton yarn, due to depleted inventories and high raw cotton prices. Therefore, they aggressively bought forward contracts, with the last three months breaking the new record seen after November and April. The peak reached 208.9 yuan. In the afternoon, profiteers cashed out, and the price suddenly plummeted.</p>
<p>Forward Month Yarn Once Saw New High Prices</p>
<p>In the morning trading of standard yarn, the near month was slightly flat, with a small decrease of 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The far month was auctioned at a high price, but the market situation was still firm. After two or three rounds of bidding, the price of raw cotton moved forward, and the trading floor suddenly became tense, with particularly strong buying interest. The bullish trend in the last three months became increasingly intense, with a major player continuing to buy. News of continued gains in public bonds further boosted sentiment, and new highs for the far month emerged one after another. The April contract approached the 210 yuan mark. At the close, Changfeng, Jinchang, and Dafu unanimously offered to sell, and the market situation slightly weakened. As a result, each month rose by 1.5, 1.6 to 2.1 yuan compared to the closing price on the 7th, except for the current month, which only rose by 0.4 yuan. The market suddenly declined in the afternoon, and the situation changed drastically. Large-scale selling by those who had profited in the morning led to sluggish sentiment, and selling pressure intensified. The market gradually declined step by step. After a surge of ten yuan in three days, there should have been this reaction. As a result, each month fell by 2 to 3.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Dafu sold 4,100 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, Jinchang 3,100 bales, Ruida 2,600 bales, Dachangcheng 1,850 bales, Weifeng 5,650 bales, Xincheng 600 bales, Tongfu 700 bales, and Zhenda 800 bales. Tongfei bought 1,850 bales, Mingsui 2,450 bales, Hexing 2,050 bales, Yuanyi 5,100 bales, Taichang 1,400 bales, Dafeng 950 bales, Yuanda 900 bales, Changyu 800 bales, Renfeng 1,300 bales, Xincheng 1,800 bales, and Yichang 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Compared to Previous Day Inventory</p>
<p>November 198.5 196.5 196.5 Down 1.60 13,800</p>
<p>December 201.5 199.0 199.0 Down 1.00 45,650</p>

<p>April 208.9 205.7 205.7 Down 0.80 35,050</p>
<p>Total 200,100</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Have More Than 600 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still sustainable. It is found that various firms bought a total of 625 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 2 to 3 yuan. The purchase amounts of each firm are listed below:</p>
<p>Xuzhou 5 Mainland 285 Hankou 30 Nanjing 40</p>
<p>Same Industry 80 Guangdong 35 Changsha 10 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi 60 Tianjin 45 Shantou 15</p>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the degree of rise and fall was very large. Initially, speculators worked hard to absorb, and the atmosphere of firmness was very strong, and the rise was severe. However, Dongmian Foreign Firm released a large number of bales, and in the afternoon, due to sufficient chips in the market, a reaction suddenly occurred and retraced.</p>
<p>Forward Flowers Reached Five Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning trading of standard cotton, the near month was still flat, but when auctioned to the far month, it suddenly jumped up. Buying interest was seen again as dense, and banks and a certain party continued to absorb, making the trading floor brisk. After two or three rounds of bidding, each month flew up uniformly, and new peaks after November 4 were discovered. The April contract once saw 45 yuan, and after Changhe and Changfeng released large quantities, the closing price slightly retraced. As a result, each month rose by 0.15 to 0.46 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation turned sharply downward in the afternoon, with large-scale liquidations by the bulls in the morning, the trading floor loosened, and buying subsided. As a result, each month fell by 0.3 to 0.7 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Dafu sold 4,900 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan, Changfeng 10,100 dan, Runkang 2,300 dan, Yikang 4,500 dan, Changhe 12,100 dan, Dafeng 2,700 dan, Renfeng 3,100 dan, Dachangcheng 5,400 dan, and Yicheng 2,400 dan.

<p>Overseas Cotton Markets All Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and due to industry price limits on buying December and other recent contracts, each month rose by 4 to 7 points. The December contract was very high due to the firmness of spot goods in the South and few deliveries. Later, due to the small number of ginning reports, buyers were very enthusiastic, and the January contracts sold by hedgers and cotton storage locations were absorbed. Finally, due to the liquidation of some bulls, there was a slight pullback, and the closing was firm. Spot goods rose by 10 points, and futures rose by 6 to 10 points. British spot cotton rose by 4 points, and futures rose by 6 to 8 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to reports that the United States would increase cotton fields, but it was firm due to retail buying. Pingor rose by half a rupee, the March contract fell by 0.75 rupees, Aumra rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is on the left.

<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Also Rise Sharply and Fall Back Slightly</h3>
<p>Fell Back in the Afternoon Following Yarn Flowers</p>
<p>The flour market opened yesterday morning and once again presented a state of high prices, as foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was strong 0.5 to 0.8, Canada strong 0.5. People were already expecting high prices, and with this help, the purchasing of insiders and outsiders was naturally triggered. It was heard that the intentions of gangs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and the inland were very strong, especially the Yonggang had a smoother intake. Therefore, the recent period also broke through the one-dollar mark, and the March and April periods broke through the three-yuan and two-corner mark, all of which were new records. The transaction reached more than 600,000 bags, and the increase was already three to four cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still strong at first, but then the flowers and yarns fell sharply, causing large bulls to offer for sale. Large factories also withdrew more and sold back, so people's hearts suddenly calmed down and fell back two to three cents. The transaction turned clear, only doing more than 300,000 bags.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened in the morning, and the quotations for foreign wheat rose by about 0.5 to 0.8. The people in the industry were more active in thinking, and the asking prices for each month were up by about 0.3 to 0.5. Although most of them were not looking down, they were inevitably wary because the market value was too high. Therefore, the transaction was not smooth, and the rising trend also felt weak. When the market opened in the afternoon, the various months were still not very prosperous, and the price hovered, similar to the morning. Looking at the future, if there is no foreign wheat relief, there is inevitably a feeling of no goods in the market. Due to the customer's bargaining, the factory did not take advantage of the existing wheat, resulting in no transaction.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat Market Demand Expands, This is a Powerful Reflection of the Market at Home and Abroad and the Market Abroad, Argentina's Crops are Damaged, the Demand for Old Wheat is Quite Good, it is Reported that the Export Demand for Canadian Wheat has Increased.</p>

<p>Du Glutinous Rice Sales are Clear</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) A total of 60 numbers arrived from various firms yesterday, (approximately 12,000 stones of goods). The thin rice sales market was not smooth on this street, and Baowei continued to have Jinqing and other firms handle 1,000 to 2,000 bags. Chipan was critical because he saw that the sales were stagnant, so the market color was slightly softened. Houzaogeng and others were sold because the seller's thoughts were more fixed. Dujian was short of goods for many days, but yesterday he was unique for several minutes. Yangjian followed firmly, and Yinbianyuan only had a rice load to go, and the price fell by one or two cents to three cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 45 or 6 numbers came from various sources in Hexia. The market's white glutinous rice was sluggish, and the price was slightly one or two cents. The sales of thin rice Baowei were slightly transformed, and the zero sales were ordinary, and the price was slightly angular. Early rice was also slightly outside the angle, and Yangjian Bu Jian Ling Xiao turned dull, and the price was also close to the angle. Baiyuan was also slightly outside the angle, and the other goods were also a small number of minutes to a cent.</p>
<p>Ke Xian's Street Purchasing Transformed</p>
<p>Imported Rice Prices are High</p>
<p>Yesterday Ke Xian was still prosperous to the end. Gan, Xiang, Wen, Tai, Yong, and Min continued to be loaded, especially Wen and Tai rice arrived continuously, while Shenglu North Gang had already stopped and waited and watched, and hoarding households did not continue to handle smoothly. Therefore, all the rice turned flat and soft. Wen and Tai rice had already continued to be small for three or five minutes. The rest were able to stand firm because the purchase of this street turned active. The entire day opened 1,600 bags of Gan rice, 460 bags of Xiang rice, 450 bags of Yong rice, 1,500 bags of Wen Tai, and 450 bags of Min rice, all of which were handled by this street. Imported rice prices were high, and it had long been despaired, and the hoarding was not abundant. If there is no Ke Xian, the market price may be difficult to stabilize. Yesterday, 200 bags were sent from this street to Saigon, and the price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Standard Exchange Guangdong Sugar成交有限</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday was sluggish because sales were still low and the market was sluggish. The association's zoning was not very bright. The spot price of 24 coarse sand white was 22 yuan and 0.05 points, and the transit goods were 6 yuan and 9.5 cents, all of which lacked transactions. The cotton white of this factory was also flat and firm, and Zhenji No. 1 was 21 yuan. The rest of the 11345 were returned as usual. The cooperative company's standard exchange transactions were also small. A total of 660 bags of Wuyang Yue coarse white were priced at 22 yuan and 0.05 points, and only 100 bags were transacted. The rest were 1,000 bags of transit Dutch coarse white, 6 yuan and 9.5 cents, 1,490 bags of Yue cotton white No. 2, 21 yuan and 0.2 cents, more than 1,000 bags of No. 4, 21 yuan, and 400 bags of No. 2, 20 yuan and 5.5 cents. The price was not up or down, and there was still a lack of buyers. Dong Chi Dong Bai Yuan The original price was called, but there were no transactions.</p>

<p>Medium-Thick Serge is Scarce and Popular</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics have been in great demand since the price increase. Unfortunately, the economy is still tight, so buyers dare not enter too much. If the environment improves, sales will be smooth, and the market may have new developments. Currently, there is an insufficient supply of medium-thick serge on the market, especially goods around 4 yuan 2 or 3 cents are in short supply. Therefore, the market is very popular, and the cheapest goods now sell for 4 yuan 7 or 8 cents per yard. Yihua goods woven in Shanghai also need to be sold for 5 and a half yuan per yard. Raw wool is 3 yuan and 9 cents, Hongsheng single-width Zhuanghou serge is 2 yuan and 3 cents, Tianyou is 5 yuan, and Dongfang is 5 yuan and 1 cent.</p>

<p>Special Autumn Issue Chrysanthemum</p>
<h3>Lament for "Chrysanthemums"</h3>
<p>— (Meng Zhao)</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are hermits, standing proudly in the frost, not competing with ordinary flowers for beauty. With integrity and a pure breeze, people compete to praise them.</p>
<p>However, I occasionally passed through bustling streets and saw signs saying "Chrysanthemums Cheap Sale."</p>
<p>I walked around to admire them and saw many good flowers, some slender and some plump, swaying gracefully. The prices were marked at 4, 6 cents, 1 yuan, and 2 yuan. I couldn't help but feel that famous chrysanthemums were being buried and felt sad for them.</p>
<p>Once a chrysanthemum is praised by a celebrity, its value increases tenfold, and it is供養 in a study. But once it falls into the hands of ordinary people, they use it as a tool to make money. It is just like a maiden from a respectable family who falls into a brothel, is abused by an evil madam, and is forced to stand on the street soliciting customers. Are there any Tao Yuanming enthusiasts who will rise up and become flower protectors?</p>
<h3>Loving Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>Growing flowers was originally an elegant affair for cultured people. Although I don't have the qualifications of a cultured person, I still like these trinkets. So people often say that these are also elegant affairs, but in reality, I am not worthy of being called a cultured person, so how can there be any elegant affairs? Besides, I am not trying to learn to be a cultured person. This is just what my nature likes and what my heart loves.</p>
<p>In my courtyard, there are two flower beds. In addition to finding all kinds of exotic flowers and plants to transplant in them, I also look for various plants that are not easily seen to plant inside.</p>
<p>The flowers on the cart can be said to be continuous throughout the four seasons. No matter what season it is, there are several kinds of flowers and plants to enjoy. The four kinds of flowers that I usually like are: plum blossoms, orchids, lotus flowers, and chrysanthemums, and chrysanthemums are my favorite. Now, in my courtyard, there are more than a dozen kinds of chrysanthemums planted, a total of more than 30 pots, including red, yellow, purple, blue, white, lotus, light and dark, and combined colors. Although they cannot be called anything famous, they are still lovely. Because in addition to the "Blood Droplets", "Golden Plate承露", "Cranes Dancing in the Sky", "Night Fragrance", "Lion Ball", "Phoenix Tail", and "Peacock Screen" that are available in the market, there are also several kinds that I have named myself using the names of ancient poems. Such as: Mantingfang, Willow Yellow, Osmanthus Fragrance, Green Shirt Wet, Drunken Flower Yin, 相见欢, East Wind First Branch, Happy Moving Orioles, Exploring Spring, Butterfly Love Flower, West River Moon, etc., are all determined according to their color, nature and form.</p>
<p>In the past two years, however, I have had no time to cultivate them personally due to my career, so I have to entrust all the responsibilities to my wife, because my wife is a loyal comrade of my love of flowers.</p>
<h3>Eating Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are noble scholars, so those who plant and appreciate chrysanthemums all become elegant people, and those who can compose poems about chrysanthemums are naturally even more noble.</p>
<p>When it comes to chrysanthemums, it seems that they are only for the appreciation and chanting of noble and elegant scholars. Little do they know that the petals of chrysanthemums are a very good food. My hometown is a rural village outside Suzhou. Although my hometown has never produced famous scholars or poets, every one of the more than 30 families in the village planted half a plot of autumn chrysanthemums. Planting chrysanthemums in my hometown was not for appreciation, but for the sole purpose of eating.</p>
<p>The most common way to eat them is to make chrysanthemum cakes. First, pick the petals of the blooming chrysanthemums, wash them, let them cool until they are half-dry, and then sugar-preserve them with osmanthus flowers, seal them in a bottle, and bury them underground. When they are opened in March and April of the following year, the petals have been completely preserved, and at the same time, the juice has a very rich mixed fragrance of chrysanthemums and osmanthus flowers. Use this sugar juice to mix into the flour, and use a printed version engraved with chrysanthemums to print the cakes piece by piece. There is no need to add any储子. After steaming, it is a fragrant chrysanthemum cake. Although the reason why chrysanthemum cake is famous is because it is usually printed with a chrysanthemum version, or because it is made with chrysanthemum brine, it is impossible to verify. Anyway, it is called chrysanthemum cake, which is very meaningful. If you want pure chrysanthemum juice, you only need to not mix it with osmanthus flowers when sugar-preserving it, but its taste is not as rich as that of osmanthus flowers, but the fragrance is more than that.</p>
<p>Crab powder chrysanthemum pot is also one of the chrysanthemum food methods in my hometown, but this is only used for banquets. First, stir-fry the crab powder, then pour in the prepared plump chrysanthemum petals. While pouring, lift the pot away from the fire, and stir it two or three times with quick hands. The deliciousness of crab, the fragrance of chrysanthemums, when eaten when the wine is half-drunk, there is really a benefit of refreshing and sobering up. The amount of chrysanthemum petals is most appropriate with two parts crab powder to one part chrysanthemum petals. If there is too much crab powder, the chrysanthemum辦 will be overcooked, and the fragrance will be reduced. If there are too many chrysanthemum 辦, it will make the eater's tongue feel bitter. In Shanghai, I have also eaten so-called chrysanthemum pot in a certain wine, but it is just sparse chrysanthemum petals floating on the dish. It is only a name, and each person only has ten or so strands on their mouths, and they can't taste any tea at all.</p>
<p>To offer chrysanthemums for people to gorge on, this may give elegant people a feeling of boiling cranes and burning琴, which seems to be a big disappointment. In fact, it is better to pick them when they are blooming and repair the five internal organs than to let the flowers bloom and wither and be trampled by people. Therefore, I especially introduce it to readers for a quick taste.</p>
<h3>Good Colors of the East Hedge</h3>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<h3>Complaining for Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>There are the most types of chrysanthemums. The ancients called him "節花", which still makes some sense; because he bloomed when all the flowers were withering, and served as the last in the team of flowers. Isn't this kind of qualification worthy of admiration? It is also because he has endured severe frost and cold, and still stands independently, fighting against the north wind, without showing any weakness! So chrysanthemums bloom in many colors, and they are all very beautiful! Look, are there any wandering bees and butterflies to invade him at this time? Everyone knows that there will be none. Then, the rank of chrysanthemums is really several times higher than that of other ordinary flowers!</p>
<p>However, generally people who love chrysanthemums prefer to use chrysanthemums to symbolize women. I don't know why? Like "Powder Xishi", "Beautiful Face Change", "Drunk Concubine Yang", "Changing New Makeup", if you want to list this kind of nouns, there are really a lot. Now, if you find a rare famous chrysanthemum, no matter what kind of flower he is, hey! He will actually match the word "modern" and call it "Modern Chrysanthemum"; isn't this insulting the integrity of the chrysanthemum and the reputation inherited from the three paths of shrubs? Not enough, treat chrysanthemums like prostitutes, when they are in full bloom, display them in the middle of gold and paper, and force them to be smoked by wine and lights day and night. In a few days, alas! The color of the flowers has changed, and the branches and leaves have gradually withered and yellowed. Seeing the haggard appearance, people will naturally be disgusted. In the end, they will be abandoned to the side of the wall, and no one will pay attention to them anymore! You think, the life of chrysanthemums is so pitiful, I really feel injustice for him, and I want to use a pen to appeal.</p>
<p>What reason is there? Chrysanthemums are most suitable in the wilderness and between fences, so he has a chic and refined charm; if there is a clear stream reflecting it, and the rice paddies are like clouds, and the half-closed thatched door is on the outside, he would rather be close to the old farmers. This is the chrysanthemum's wish; even if there are no confidants to appreciate it, he can also freely eat the clouds and drink dew, and he can also leave a fragrance in his later years. Even if he braves the frost and rain, he is enough to be proud of himself in the world! If not, after suffering so much suffering, using bamboo branches to tie him and hemp threads to tie him up, like a prisoner, living in a dungeon every day, Chrysanthemum is holding a belly full of injustice, and wants to hope that people will rescue him.</p>
<h3>Japanese Chrysanthemum Exhibition (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Japanese chrysanthemums were originally introduced from our country. Although the variety is not as diverse as what we currently have, their cultivation methods are far superior. The reason is that the Japanese always maintain a dissatisfied attitude towards everything, constantly striving for improvement. There are many chrysanthemum research groups, the most famous being the Akikoka, Jugukai, and Choseikai, etc. They have branches in various places, and their activities are very developed. Each exhibition centers around Hibiya Park.</p>
<p>Everyone in our country knows that cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan, but this is actually wrong. Cherry blossoms are merely a unique flower and tree to Japan, and they are popular among the Japanese people due to their beautiful color. The national flower of Japan is the chrysanthemum. Their medals often have yellow chrysanthemum patterns, which are symbols of the national flower.</p>
<p>Japan categorizes chrysanthemums into three sizes: large, medium, and small. Our country's pink lotus and unicorn horn, etc., with larger flower heads, belong to the large chrysanthemum category. Cloud Phoenix, Crane Dance Cloud Zero, etc., with smaller flower heads, are classified as medium chrysanthemums, while others such as longan and aster are small chrysanthemums. The naming of chrysanthemums in Japan is also the same as in our country, each based on their own meaning, without any fixed rules. Generally, flowers with broad petals are called "lotus," while spherical flowers with clustered petals are called "thick objects." Flowers with tubular and swirling petals are called "embracing." Petals are divided into three types: tubular petals, spoon petals, and flat petals. The evaluation criteria are divided into eleven categories: color, luster, flower body, flower shape, petal quality, character, talent, strength, flower stem, leaves, and future. Those selected into grades are awarded gold cups, silver cups, certificates, etc. by the association, all of which are considered to be the highest honor.</p>
<p>The posture of large and medium chrysanthemums cultivated in Japan can be divided into two types: one is ordinary potted plants, and the other is the landscape arrangement of our country. There is no fixed form for landscape arrangements, which is the same as in our country. One chrysanthemum plant has hundreds of flowers, arranged into various forms, seeking beauty and neatness. Potted plants are entirely for appreciation and evaluation, so they are the most exquisite. Each pot of chrysanthemum has at least three branches, forming a triangle with the same height. Our country's precious chrysanthemums often only have one independent branch, which is not the case there. From a young age, the branches are divided into three parts, and they try their best to cultivate them to grow. The mud pot is about one foot high and seven or eight inches in diameter. If the pot is small, the flower will be thin, which is why chrysanthemum growers in our country must liberate the flower pots. The flower stem is thick and tall, more than three feet, supported by purple bamboo, so the branches are straight, with no side branches. The leaves are fat and dense, from the roots to the top of the stem, there is not a single leaf that has fallen off or turned yellow. In our country, we mostly only use manure for fertilization, which seems insufficient, and scientific methods must be used. When fertilizing, the gardeners often accidentally stain the roots and leaves with fertilizer, causing the roots and leaves to often scorch and fall off. Also, the flower pots are low and small, placed on the ground, and rainwater splatters mud onto the leaves, blocking the fine pores that absorb nutrients, which also easily leads to scorching and falling off. Therefore, the flower pots must be tall and large, and it is not necessary to place them on the ground to receive ground energy. Chrysanthemums like sunlight but fear sunburn, so it is advisable to put them in a flower shed.</p>
<p>After seeing the Japanese chrysanthemums, I feel that our country's chrysanthemums are delicate and somewhat sickly. Their chrysanthemums have three branches that are equally developed, and the flowering time is the same, without any distinction. The corolla is large and fat, reaching six or seven inches in diameter, and the spherical ones are hemispherical, unlike our country's which are flat and small. The petals are thick and fat, and the luster is also good. A cardboard or circular lead wire frame is placed under the flower to prevent the petals from falling down and damaging the flower's posture. If there are more than three branches, the arrangement also has a certain format, with approximately a pentagon or hexagon being the most common.</p>
<h3>A New Chapter in Appreciating Chrysanthemums at Guyi Garden</h3>
<p>— Meng Fei</p>
<p>The magnificent garden is called Guyi,</p>
<p>With famous historical sites in Chaxi (i.e., Nanxiang).</p>
<p>Since the new renovation last year,</p>
<p>It has been cleaned up, splendid and picturesque.</p>
<p>There are many exotic varieties of famous flowers in all seasons,</p>
<p>And century-old trees are rare in the world.</p>
<p>The artificial mountains are stacked into immortal caves,</p>
<p>Ingenious and exquisite, with upper and lower ladders.</p>
<p>The Five Old Peaks resemble the postures of five old men,</p>
<p>With different lengths, and distinctions between thin and fat.</p>
<p>The Nine-Bend Bridge has only three curves,</p>
<p>Where you can sit and watch the fish leap and the kites fly.</p>
<p>There is the Phoenix Terrace, and the Fishing Rock,</p>
<p>And bamboo branches and green bamboos ripple.</p>
<p>Next to the Plum Blossom Hall, plum blossoms are planted,</p>
<p>And white cranes perch in the White Crane Pavilion.</p>
<p>An unmoored boat is docked by the pond,</p>
<p>And the decorations in the boat are even more exquisite.</p>
<p>Therefore, tourists gather like clouds all year round,</p>
<p>Holding hands in front of the flowers, laughing and talking softly.</p>
<p>Today, the sky is clear and the clouds are leisurely, with good autumn colors,</p>
<p>And yellow flowers fill the eyes with a riot of colors,</p>
<p>Snow Lion, Drunken Concubine Yang,</p>
<p>Kirin Belt, Phoenix Robe,</p>
<p>All are extraordinary and new flowers, showing their strangeness.</p>
<p>They are stacked into several flower mountains,</p>
<p>Dazzling the eyes and captivating the mind,</p>
<p>The public exhibition is free of charge,</p>
<p>And the scheduled time is half a month.</p>
<p>Presumably, a generation of Yuanming with a chrysanthemum obsession,</p>
<p>Will surely enter the garden together,</p>
<p>To appreciate the famous flowers and comment on them.</p>
<p>Literary News: "Yisheng" Issue 5, Special Issue on the Happy Event of Pan Hu, is rich in content and interesting. It is selling very well. Since it has been jointly promoted by Shanghai Magazine Company and various newspaper stands and bookstores both locally and abroad, over ten thousand copies have already been sold. Some people have purchased seven or eight copies to give as gifts to relatives and friends. There are not many books left, so purchase quickly if you wish to buy.</p>
<h3>Casual Talks on Chrysanthemum Cultivation</h3>
<p>— (Ying Dai)</p>
<p>As autumn is about to end, chrysanthemums are blooming again. Among all flowers, the chrysanthemum's character has always been respected by poets and elegant scholars. Therefore, when chrysanthemums are in full bloom, people from all over hold chrysanthemum appreciation gatherings. Just in Shanghai, various gardens and amusement parks are busy opening chrysanthemum exhibitions. However, chrysanthemums are not easy to cultivate. If the same chrysanthemum plant is grown by two different people, the plant's form and the flower size will be completely different. Whether it is good or bad depends on the cultivation method. As chrysanthemums are blooming, to add some color to autumn, I will briefly describe some chrysanthemum cultivation methods that I know of:</p>
<p>Cutting: Cutting is the most common method. If the roots of last year's withered chrysanthemums are not removed, after Qingming Festival, buds will sprout from the roots, becoming new chrysanthemums. In April or May, after the chrysanthemum buds have grown, we will pluck the tops and insert them into the soil. In a few days, they will take root and come alive. Most chrysanthemum growers adopt this method.</p>
<p>Old Rootstock: The old rootstock of the chrysanthemum will also sprout after it withers and turns yellow. If we do not pluck them and let them grow, adding more fertilizer, they can grow three or four feet tall, and the flowers can be as big as a hat. However, chrysanthemum enthusiasts only occasionally use old rootstocks to cultivate large flowers and will not grow all chrysanthemums in this way.</p>
<p>Seedling: Many people know that chrysanthemums do not have seeds, but they actually do. After the large flowers wither, the collected flower seeds will sprout when sown in the soil the following year, and the flowers that bloom may be completely different from the original color and petals. It can bloom badly, but it can also bloom exceptionally well. The so-called new varieties are mostly from seedlings. Chrysanthemum enthusiasts often try to obtain new varieties.</p>
<p>Fertilization: To have large flowers when chrysanthemums bloom, sufficient fertilizer is indispensable. For chrysanthemums, bean cake and grass juice are generally the best fertilizers. Initially, they should be planted in the ground to obtain earth energy. Only when they are about to bloom can they be dug up with the soil and moved into flower pots. If they are planted in pots early on, they will not be very robust.</p>
<p>Catching Insects: During the growth period of chrysanthemums, in addition to early weather that may cause death, green caterpillars are also a major enemy. Therefore, in summer and autumn, we must inspect the chrysanthemum garden one by one every morning and evening. If we find any insect damage, we must immediately catch the small insects. Otherwise, if the branches and leaves are damaged, they will not grow easily, and may even die.</p>
<p>Pinching: When chrysanthemums are not growing, in May and June, we should also pinch off the tops. This will allow small heads to grow, and each head will have a flower. You leave as many heads as you want flowers. The small branches attached to the side should also be pinched off. However, it is best to have four or five flowers on a chrysanthemum plant. Too few is not good-looking, and too many will not grow big. It is not suitable. In August and September, when the flower buds are just sprouting, if we find that the side branches and leaves also have flower buds, we should remove them immediately to avoid too many flowers and difficulty in growing them big.</p>

<h3>Talking About Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Physician Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Since the government strictly ordered to quit smoking, smokers in various places have been in a panic for a while. They worry that it is difficult to quit after being addicted for a long time, and there is a lot of pain when quitting, which makes them hesitant and wandering. Little do they know that if the regulation and supplementation are done properly when quitting smoking, the pain can be avoided, making the body and mind happy. The smoking addiction will be broken early, and the tobacco poison will be removed early, so you can work as usual and quickly recover to health. When looking for a tonic, one that is not biased to one side and has the effect of treating diseases and strengthening the body is certainly "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素). In the past month, I have used it to save seventeen quitters, including Zhao Fulin, Cai Zhijun, Yang Xizeng, Wang Qixiang, and Cui Wenzhong, and they have all achieved satisfactory results. For a time, they all called "Sheng Zhi Su" the savior of blacklisted smokers.</p>
<h3>Experienced Treatment for Common Diseases of Young People</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The patient, Fei Jingsu, is from Minhang and is twenty-three years old. He is from the academic world. In his early years, he was poisoned by obscene books and mistakenly committed masturbation, which caused severe damage. His vitality was weakened. He began to quit masturbation unconsciously after getting married. However, due to overwork, he suffered from spermatorrhea. Starting last year, he also suffered from premature ejaculation. He repeatedly took various medicines, but they were ineffective, which gradually led to symptoms of weakness, such as back pain, dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, forgetfulness, cold limbs, body tremors, night sweats, and palpitations. He was aging before his time and was about to become consumptive. This spring, he was introduced by Mr. Xu Enming to seek treatment at my clinic. Mr. Xu had also suffered from neurasthenia and youth gland weakness in the past, and I cured him. Later, he introduced many friends to my clinic, and they all left after being cured. Therefore, I am confident in my experience in treating this disease. I immediately instructed Mr. Fei to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" from Zhengwei Pharmacy and take it continuously for half a dozen. All symptoms disappeared, and he regained his health. He was as lively as a dragon and tiger, as if he had been reborn.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation Cause Weakness</h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The patient, Ni Xuexuan, is thirty-one years old and from Anhui. He claimed that he had always been fat and healthy and did not know what disease was. He came to Shanghai at the age of twenty-seven and mistakenly got involved in prostitution, which caused him to suffer from a venereal disease. Although he was cured after injections, his muscles became thin, and there was local damage, forming spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. He sought medical attention and took medicine, but it was not very effective, leading to symptoms of weakness, such as cold limbs, body tremors, night sweats, and palpitations. He was ill all over and had no interest in life. It was not until this spring that he came to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed Ximitou's Jing Pills and "Sheng Zhi Su" from Zhongxi Pharmacy for both symptomatic and radical treatment. He took them together according to the instructions, and all his illnesses were gone in less than two months. He recovered completely, and his muscles were firm, and his blood was full. He felt stronger than before.</p>
<h3>Standards for Winter Tonic</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>There are hundreds of tonics, each with biased efficacy. It is almost impossible to find one that takes care of everything comprehensively.</p>
<p>Essence, blood, brain, and marrow are the four most precious treasures of the human body. Lacking one is enough to cause disease. Moreover, these four are closely related, influencing and connected to each other, and cannot be neglected. Therefore, the best standard for tonics is to supplement all four: essence, blood, brain, and marrow.</p>
<p>The latest medical science has an amazing discovery: there is an even more important treasure in the human body, namely the endocrine system. Any deficiency or abnormality in the endocrine system will cause various symptoms of essence deficiency, blood weakness, brain weakness, and marrow depletion. If the endocrine system is sufficient, it will directly supplement these four and indirectly nourish the entire body, limbs, and bones.</p>
<p>Standard's endocrine preparation, "Sheng Zhi Su," has a well-chosen formula and is properly prepared. It has unparalleled special effects for patients suffering from weakness and youth gland diseases. Even those who are not sick have the effect of strengthening the body. Therefore, "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most suitable for winter tonic. Because we have repeatedly used it and are satisfied, we are happy to introduce it.</p>
<h3>Kidney Disease Diagnosis Report</h3>
<p>— Yao Yuchang, MD, Medical Doctor of Pennsylvania University, USA</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>There are Many Symptoms of Youth Gland Weakness</p>
<p>The patient, Chen Dexin, is a Jiangsu native, twenty-five years old, and in the business world. (Chief Complaint) — Premature ejaculation, thin sperm, neurasthenia. (Medical History) — Mr. Chen committed masturbation since childhood, causing severe damage. He had not quit after marriage, resulting in great damage to his sexual performance. After marriage, he suffered from premature ejaculation, dizziness, blurred vision, weakness in the limbs, brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, multiple dreams, thin and cold sperm, and hopelessness for offspring. The feelings between husband and wife were nominal. This spring, he suffered from weak stomach and indigestion, muscle wasting, and neurasthenia, and was about to become consumptive. He came to my clinic for treatment. (Presenting Symptoms) — Weak stomach, insomnia, forgetfulness, aging before his time. (Treatment) — In addition to using "Jian Wei Su" (Stomach Strengthening 素) to treat his weak stomach, making his appetite strong and absorbing sufficient nutrients from food, he was also given a large amount of "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素). After more than a month, he immediately felt his brain strong, his essence strong, his blood thick, and his marrow full. His muscles were firm, and his back was strong. Premature ejaculation and insomnia were all cured. Recently, Mr. Chen was transferred to South China to serve as the manager of a branch company. He took his family with him and sent a letter of thanks, saying that his wife was already six months pregnant.</p>
<h3>Combined Treatment of Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<p>The patient, Li Tingxuan, is a Sichuan native, thirty-nine years old, and in the industrial world. (Chief Complaint) — Kidney deficiency, spermatorrhea, insomnia, premature ejaculation. (Medical History) — Mr. Li was poisoned by obscene books at the age of seventeen and mistakenly committed masturbation. He exhausted himself daily, causing great damage. He quit masturbation unconsciously after marriage, but suffered from spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. He repeatedly took tonics, but they were not cured. Due to exhaustion of essence and weakness of the brain, he developed symptoms such as insomnia and forgetfulness. Last year, his condition worsened, with body tremors, cold limbs, night sweats, palpitations, back pain, mental fatigue, fear of labor, and straining during bowel movements, also presenting spermatorrhea. It was not until this summer that he was introduced by Mr. Xu Zhongxing to seek treatment at my clinic. (Presenting Symptoms) — Loose sperm gate, neurasthenia. (Treatment) — I used a combined symptomatic and radical treatment method. I instructed him to purchase Ximitou's Jing Pills and "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and take them simultaneously for about five boxes. All symptoms were cured. What was most gratifying was that he did not feel tired at all even when doing heavy labor.</p>
<h3>The Great Savior in the Midst of the Anti-Smoking Movement</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Chen Dongyuan</p>
<p>Opium is harmful and poisons the whole country, weakening the people and making us a laughingstock to other nations. Recently, the government has resolved to ban smoking, with the harshest punishments as a warning. Blacklisted smokers are now in awe and scramble to quit. However, during the quitting period, sudden changes in physiology cause both the body and mind to suffer. The diseases that have been concealed in the past arise in confusion, causing great pain and hindering the complete success of quitting smoking. It is essential to have a complete regulating agent for treating diseases and strengthening the body. I used to smoke to alleviate my illness. This autumn, when I quit smoking, the illness recurred, and I was about to give up halfway and fail. Fortunately, I was diagnosed and treated by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan, who instructed me to purchase and take "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) from Zhengcheng Pharmacy for regulation. Only then did I complete the effort. What I am most satisfied with is that there was no pain during the quitting period, and my mind was happy. The smoking poison was removed early, and the smoking addiction was broken early. "Sheng Zhi Su" is truly a great savior in the midst of the anti-smoking movement.</p>
<h3>The Pain of Neurasthenia is Unbearable</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Zhu Yutian</p>
<p>Because I was born with insufficient endowment, my body was weak. I was easily susceptible to illness. I have taken many tonics, but they were ineffective. After many years of procrastination, I became increasingly depleted. Starting from the year before last, I gradually fell into symptoms of neurasthenia, such as tinnitus, blurred vision, multiple dreams, insomnia, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and back pain. Although I continued to take tonics, the disease gradually worsened, and I was on the verge of death, feeling extremely pessimistic. It was not until this spring that I was introduced by Mr. Lei Qianan to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for diagnosis and treatment. I was treated with electrotherapy and instructed to purchase Ximitou's Jing Pills and "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) from Wing On Company and take them according to the instructions. After about five weeks, all symptoms gradually disappeared. My muscles were full, my mind was clear, and my memories were like waking from a dream.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment for Women's Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>For treating leukorrhea, external use is better than internal use. External use has direct efficacy on the affected area, like applying medicine to a wound, draining pus, removing decay, sterilizing, and disinfecting. However, if you take a special medicine for gynecology at the same time, you can make your body healthier and remove the root of the disease early, just like taking a blood-clearing and modifying agent internally for those with external symptoms. Combining internal and external treatments yields faster results.</p>
<p>"Liaodai Ling" is a miraculous medicine for self-treating leukorrhea. The beauty lies in not needing a doctor or assistant, allowing for secret self-treatment. Just insert one tablet of this product into the vagina every other night. No matter how mild or severe the disease is, it can be cured on schedule. It is truly the greatest guarantee for women's health and the only savior for patients with leukorrhea.</p>
<p>If you take "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) for women internally at the same time, you can remove all diseases of the uterus, regulate menstruation, activate blood, remove stagnation, and relieve pain, comprehensively treating all difficult and complex gynecological diseases, secret and hidden diseases. The two medicines work together, and the effect is greatest. (Note: "Sheng Zhi Su" for women can be purchased directly from Andersons.)</p>
<h3>A Case of Spermatorrhea and Wet Dreams Treatment</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Dou Bingdie</p>
<p>I am at the height of my prime, but because I did not take care of myself when I was young, I damaged myself excessively, resulting in a thin body. I often suffered from spermatorrhea. Sometimes I had many erotic dreams and ejaculated after waking up. Sometimes, even without dreams, I would ejaculate in a daze. Later, even when urinating during the day, I would leak silken white sperm. My face was yellow and pale, and I could no longer bear it. Fortunately, I was introduced by my relative, Mr. Xi Shijiang, to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Zhan diagnosed that my sperm gate was loose and that I had prostatic leakage. He used electrotherapy for treatment and instructed me to purchase Ximitou's Jing Pills and Standard's "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) from Wuzhou Pharmacy. I took the medicines together, and after more than a month, the spermatorrhea was cured. It has never recurred. I am strong and healthy, and my face and lips are rosy. Compared to before, it is like two different people.</p>

<h3>Medical Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, 2nd Floor, China Trust Company</p>
<p>(1) Treatment for Kidney Atrophy</p>
<p>The patient is thirty-two years old, from Hangzhou, and in the business world. Because he was born weak and deficient, he was frail and sickly, spending his days in the medicine furnace and tea stove. What he suffered most was kidney atrophy. He mistakenly took excitants, which was like adding fuel to the fire. Once the medicine wore off, he was even more listless. Not only did he lose his prestige in his marriage, but he also felt that life was meaningless. His business had suffered losses due to the economic downturn in recent years, and he felt increasingly depressed, gradually developing neurasthenia. This spring, he was introduced by a friend to my clinic for treatment. In addition to using electrotherapy to stimulate his nerve endings, I also instructed him to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) from Wing On Company. After about five boxes, he immediately felt his essence thick, his marrow full, and his Qian Dao (male vitality) invigorated. His illness was cured, the feelings between husband and wife were restored, and he began to feel that life was brilliantly vibrant.</p>
<p>(2) Insomnia and Spermatorrhea Cause Extreme Pain</p>
<p>The patient, Wu Zhongquan, is nineteen years old, from Dangtu, and in the academic world. He had committed masturbation several years ago, damaging himself excessively. In the winter of his seventeenth year, he was persuaded by a good friend to force himself to quit. However, he suffered from insomnia at night, tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep all night. Sometimes he would fall asleep in a daze and have many dreams, often presenting spermatorrhea. By the following spring, he would ejaculate even without dreams. Until last autumn, he would leak silken, sticky drips after urinating during the day. His energy was exhausted, and he was extremely depleted. He had taken various spermatorrhea medicines and tonic pills, but they were nominal. This spring, he was introduced by Mr. Xu Kekong to seek treatment at my clinic. I found that Mr. Wu's sperm gate was extremely loose and that he suffered from prostatic leakage. In addition to using the latest scientific surgical electrotherapy method, I also used Ximitou's Jing Pills to treat his spermatorrhea and Standard's "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction 素) to supplement his essence, blood, brain, and marrow. In less than two months, the spermatorrhea was eradicated, he slept peacefully at night, and his body was strong and healthy. Recently, he introduced his close friend, Mr. Lu Xianze, to treat the same disease. I could hardly recognize him in his healthy state. He said that he would be getting married soon.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays</p>

<h3>Silk Material Shortage Forces Shutdowns</h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>A report states: "Several silk factories in this city that had commenced operations have recently had to suspend production due to a lack of raw materials, rendering them unable to reel silk. As of last month, sixteen factories have already ceased operations, and by the end of this month, it is feared that all will be forced to shut down."</p>
<p>According to a prominent figure in the silk industry, the reason for the "lack of raw materials" is that "in recent years, due to the global economic recession and the dumping of cheap Japanese silk, Chinese silk has suffered a setback, with prices plummeting. As a result, silkworm farmers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, finding it unprofitable, have turned to other occupations. However, since the beginning of this summer, the silkworm-producing areas in Japan have suffered from floods, reducing output, while demand from Europe and America has increased, leading to active sales and rising silk prices." Nevertheless, while on the one hand "sales are active and silk prices are rising," on the other hand, because "silkworm farmers are raising very few silkworms, resulting in low production," the "great turnaround in Chinese silk exports" has ultimately been thwarted by a "lack of raw materials," forcing shutdowns. Consequently, the silk industry is requesting the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction to pay attention to two points: "First, increase the distribution of silkworm eggs. This year, only over 1.8 million sheets of improved silkworm eggs were distributed. Next year, at least 6 million sheets must be distributed to ensure that production and sales are balanced. Second, cultivate mulberry forests. In recent years, silkworm farmers, because they have witnessed the sharp decline in silk prices, view silkworm farming with dread, and not only do they not cultivate the mulberry trees they have planted, but they are also cutting them down on a large scale, resulting in insufficient silkworm feed and causing panic." At the same time, the silk industry itself has decided to "improve technology."</p>
<p>The reason for the decline of the national silk industry in recent years, as a certain silk industry magnate said, is "due to the global economic recession and the dumping of cheap Japanese silk." However, why can others "dump prices," while we alone cannot "lower" prices? Speaking of which, our history of silkworm farming is longer than theirs.</p>
<p>The reason, in short, is that our silkworm farmers adhere to old methods in everything they do, without knowing how to research or apply scientific methods. As a result, even silkworm eggs have to be bought from them as "improved varieties," and other things are even more imaginable. Not only is the method of silkworm farming like this, but even worse is that they are helped by the government and adopt collective methods, while we still rely on individual silkworm farmers with their meager strength to "fight on their own."</p>
<p>Due to different economic structures and methods, may I ask, how can they not be "forced" to "turn to other occupations," how can they succeed?</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding this year's "active sales and rising silk prices," this is also the result of occasional good timing and location. Therefore, the silk industry's hope for the two points from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction also feels too distant. Whether increasing the number of silkworm eggs from over 1.8 million sheets to 6 million sheets will cause problems in the supply of mulberry leaves will be discussed later, but whether the result of 6 million sheets of silkworm eggs will lead to accumulation and difficulty in selling should be considered first. Not long ago, didn't we see news about people fearing that cocoons would hatch into moths and being unable to afford warehouse rent? As for the second point, that depends on the "increase or decrease in market prices." If there is confidence in production, then there is no need for the Department of Construction to pay attention; the silkworm farmers themselves will quickly restore it to its former appearance. Otherwise, no matter how much attention the Department of Construction pays, since they have "turned to other occupations," they will naturally "cut down the useless mulberry trees on a large scale."</p>
<p>Currently, the most crucial question is how to compete with others in the world market. Other minor issues must all be determined by how the crucial question can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Madman</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>The sunlight had already crept over the window seam, stealingly hanging on the white ash wall, reflecting a few purple-red lines, intricately, silently.</p>
<p>Widow Ma's cuckoo clock had already sounded seven times. Her daughter-in-law, Wang Wanglao, was already busily clanging and banging things in the kitchen, muttering, cursing as if in a dream, starting with cursing the weather, then the kitten for being disobedient and not letting her sleep well at night, and then her mother-in-law, her husband for being gluttonous and lazy, a long string of complaints, as if telling someone: then the sound of straw rustling, the sound of striking a lighter, followed by the crackling sound of flames.</p>
<p>As usual, at this time, most of the students would already be standing under the lychee tree with their schoolbags on their backs, shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, the sun is shining on your butt!"</p>
<p>But now it was past seven o'clock, and although the weather was cold, the good sun was still… and the lychee tree</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>was still so quiet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of clamor came from the corner of the village, laughter, shouts, calls, curses overflowing in a团, and the noise was getting closer and closer, clearer and louder. I was suspicious and got up and looked out through the window seam. I saw people crowded on the hexagonal wall, a bald-headed, bare-chested young farmer running in front, mad and delirious, holding a bamboo flute high in his hand, shouting and cursing loudly, tears in his eyes, calling in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Arbitration? Good! Go find Mr. Lin!"</p>
<p>Behind him followed a large group of people, village school students, old people, children, and several nosy women. They kept their distance, laughing, shouting, and yelling, "Madman!" But when he stopped and waved at them, everyone hurried backward, running around in a panic.</p>
<p>They crowded toward where I lived. Widow Ma's daughter-in-law ran up from the kitchen in a panic to tell me; "Mr. Lin, the madman, with his head tilted, is banging on the door, insisting on seeing you!"</p>
<p>The knocking on the door rang loudly, and the madman, with his head tilted, howled with a sobbing, shrill voice:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin! Mr. Lin, I want to see Mr. Lin!"</p>
<p>Then came another burst of clamor and laughter from the crowd. So I put on my clothes and went out. The door opened, and the crowd erupted in enthusiastic cheering. The madman, with his head tilted, stood in front of me, full of grievances, tears shimmering in his eyes, pointing at the people who lived with him and wailing:</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, please judge, they are bullying me, saying they want to steal my bamboo flute."</p>
<p>I knew his madness had flared up again today. One cannot oppose madmen. Therefore, I pretended to be angry, widened my eyes, and shouted at the village students:</p>
<p>"Why are you bullying him? What time is it? Why aren't you properly going to school for me!" So the students quietly dispersed in fear. Those who had squeezed in to watch the fun, based on past experience, knew that after the madman found the teacher for arbitration, there would be nothing special or new to watch, so they also trickled away in twos and threes. In the end, only he and I remained.</p>
<p>We sat on the roots of the lychee tree to bask in the sun. With his head still hanging so dejectedly, it seemed that his soul was no longer attached to his body.</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, who wouldn't have given him a thumbs-up and praised him as a "typical" farmer! Pure and honest, but now he was a madman. When he was fifteen years old, his father died, and his older brother sent him to work in a relative's house in another village, peacefully passing his days in work. It had been seven or eight years now. In these seven or eight years of unpaid labor, he had obtained the relative's permission to marry a cousin. But a few months ago, he was sent to another county to buy sugarcane seedlings, and when he returned home, he discovered that his cousin had been secretly married to a farmer in a neighboring village. Although he was heartbroken, he didn't say anything, just secretly shed tears, and didn't want to do anything, ate very little, and didn't sleep well at night, just like a ghost clutching a bamboo flute, talking to himself, groping in the dark to his cousin's husband's house; so he sat on the opposite ridge of the field and played the bamboo flute with melancholy, sighing and wailing, all night long...</p>
<p>But one night, he was beaten severely because his cousin's husband discovered that their newly acquired wife was disturbed by the flute sounds all night and felt uneasy. From then on, he went mad and returned to the village he had left seven or eight years ago. Now he was Madman Yaitou.</p>
<p>We were both immersed in the intoxication of memories. After a while, he sighed deeply and unknowingly began to cry sadly.</p>
<p>"Why are you crying?" I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Crying?" He widened his eyes and looked at me in surprise, then sobbed, "People are all bullying me!" He stood up and strode toward the locust tree.</p>
<p>Soon, in the gentle air, the sound of the flute wafted from afar.</p>
<h3>Water Flower</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>A gentle night, cloaked in a deep ink-colored sky twinkling with stars. The river surface, filled with exquisite boats, is also filled with the lively sounds of songs and strings, gentle laughter, and low whispers of affection, dissolving into the bustling space, thinly spreading out, floating on the bright river surface.</p>
<p>The boat, like a forest, shot out brilliant lamp flowers, reflecting the water surface with countless window shadows, shimmering with gorgeous waves. The water undulates in the small wind, gently lapping against the boat strings, making rhythmic echoes; retreating, and kissing the river bank, colliding and spraying a string of white waves.</p>
<p>On the riverbank: the translucent contours of high-rise buildings proudly insert into the half-sky, trams clang, driving back and forth like long snakes.</p>
<p>The car brings various tourists. A small commotion rises at the riverside. A big worker stood on the deck and waved his hand:</p>
<p>"Sir, sit here. Are you waiting for the number one boat?"</p>
<p>"Sir, sit here. Are you waiting for the number one boat?"</p>
<p>Some jumped ashore to solicit business.</p>
<p>Then the boat loaded tourists and swam to the boat area in the heart of the river.</p>
<p>At this time, on the windows of each boat, the girls decorated like flowers stretched out their heads, with a seductive smile hanging on their faces. They waved with small red and green handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>The boat gradually approached.</p>
<p>"Sir, we have the best fragrant tea inside. Please come up and have some fun!"</p>
<p>"Sir, we have the best fragrant tea inside. Please come up and have some fun!"</p>
<p>So clear and melodious voices sounded together.</p>
<p>After a moment of chaos, it calmed down. Then came the sound of rowing and splashing water, and many boats sailed away separately, accompanied by even more moving singing, clear string music, and the joy of business.</p>
<p>The river surface revealed a large expanse of river water, lying under the moonlight.</p>
<p>The boat loaded people from the riverbank to the boats on the river, and then went back empty, and loaded people again in a moment. She was so busy like a shuttle. As the boats sent to and fro, the girls also had busy businesses, receiving new guests and sending off old ones. The girls' feelings were vaguely inlaid with some familiar and strange faces and eyes. Pressing their lips to each tourist's lips, their bodies fell into each tourist's chest. Late at night, the tourists emptied their pockets, took a boat to shore with a drunken daze, as if in a dream. Then the girls' wallets bulged up, their heads leaned out from the booth, and they said from a distance:</p>
<p>"Please come early tomorrow!" Then giggle.</p>
<p>The east gradually revealed fish belly white, and the scattered boats gathered back to the original place in succession. The singing and string music were sparse, and the noisy scene on the river suddenly became silent. Only a few night shift boats were lit.</p>
<p>Although there were so many boats on this river, there were even more people on yachts. The girls all had regular customers, who were permanent customers, and there were also occasional visitors who came on a whim. So the girls don't worry about no one coming, but are afraid of not being able to welcome them. Especially in the hot summer, the night breeze on the river is cool, and the air is fresh. Sitting on the boat, carrying a boat of moonlight and strings, listening to the girl's musical and intoxicating songs. Floating on the river, it's like a dream! Therefore, there are so many people on yachts, as long as after dusk, tourists will run in groups of three or five, and the boat picking up guests will be busy until midnight. If you come a little later, you won't be able to hire a boat with money.</p>
<p>Summer is a very pleasant and anticipated time for the girls.</p>
<p>At that time, in the prosperous time, the highest yacht fee was five yuan, and the cheapest one cost two silvers. Overnight expenses are historically harsh. You can also bring it ashore, and the cost will naturally be higher, but this situation is rare, because a yacht trip is for the scenery on the lake.</p>
<p>However, despite this, tourists have never decreased.</p>
<p>Days passed in a series, and the girls were the same on the water. There were still lively sounds of songs and strings on the water, but it was so quiet, and there was no gentle laughter, only empty boats carrying sorrow.</p>
<p>The prosperity on the water flowed away with the water.</p>
<p>The girls are still dressed like flowers, but there are fewer objects to appreciate. They still leaned on the window, staring, but with a sad look.</p>
<p>The boats picking up guests were also idle and flustered.</p>
<p>Why did the tourists suddenly fall to a terrible degree? Maybe they don't understand. After looking around for a long time, there was no sound on the quiet river. After a long time, I saw the boat swaying over with people, barely causing a commotion, but so few people, so many boats. What's the use? Moreover, now all those who come are regular customers with a purpose, who cannot be robbed.</p>
<p>Then a heavier sigh flew out of the river.</p>
<p>The girls lost their smiling faces, joy replaced sorrow, the songs and strings have gradually cooled down, and turned into a bitter complaint.</p>
<p>Gloomy shadows, bleak days, the girls dressed like flowers gradually withered. The boats floating on the water decreased day by day. Rain pattered outside the curtains, spring was waning, the silk quilt could not withstand the cold of the fifth watch, I didn't know I was a guest in a dream, I always enjoyed myself!</p>

<p>Rain patters outside the curtains, spring is waning, the silk quilt cannot withstand the cold of the fifth watch, I don't know I was a guest in a dream, I always enjoyed myself!</p>
<p>The old country is unbearable to look back on, and there is no place to stay in the remaining life. Wandering around, where can I find a lover or friend! Sometimes, when I am bored and uncomfortable, I don't care about the gold at the head of the bed, and I appreciate the flowers on the wall and the willows on the road! Now it is difficult to realize my ambition, so I will approach women and good wine. Stop! Stop! Stop! Wine relieves sorrow, but sorrow is even more sorrow, shout loudly, tears</p>

<p>empty flow!</p>
<p>Lodging in the open and eating in the wind during labor, resting at ease whenever you meet; the Qin Lou and Chu Pavilions are just pretending to be stupid; every time the wine is over and the people are scattered, there is only shame and annoyance left, and it is inevitable to be discouraged, now that we are in trouble, we should especially lie on firewood and taste gall. Do! Do! Do! Tears do not dry, blood does not dry, singing is miserable, sword light is cold; do not lean on the railing alone, infinite care. It is easy to say goodbye, but difficult to see each other, flowing water and falling flowers, spring is also lost, heaven and earth!</p>

<p>Opening: "Missing Home"</p>
<p>A wanderer has not returned home. He is grieved to be in a foreign land at dawn. I think of myself, a dependent person, busily in the world. The intention of the war fire in the guest is worried. There are few confidants drifting in the rivers and seas. The most unbearable thing is that my Ma River and mountain world is barren. It's not me, greedy for the prosperity of the new scenery. Dare to forget that, the clear and quiet old hometown. So that, the hate overflowing the yellow face woman leaning on the building. Leaning on the door to add white hair to the mother. Although it is, I am ashamed to be a Lai filial son for playing with colors, how can I blush and act as an ungrateful man. The tone is scarce because of laziness in temperament. There are few books because of busy affairs. Now it is, the end of the year and the return of spring, the night is gradually broken. I am alone in the lamp, sorrow is surging and hatred is growing. I can't bear to see the years follow the flowing water. Empty load of youth as a fleeting light. It is precisely loneliness in a poor study, feeling lonely. Lonely in a lonely museum, feeling lonely. I am sad to hear that, the sound of geese is sobbing and the wind is urgent. The moonlight is hazy and the night is dim. Only that, the pine cover is heavily left with late green. Plum blossoms are fragrant. It's true, three watch lamp fire two lines of tears. A piece of homesickness is a hundred knots of intestines. What I hate is, the good dream has not been fulfilled and I am surprised by the ugly fight. And I am happy that, the good news is just to report peace and health. But it is me, the schedule is still difficult to write the date. Reunion, especially need to lead the neck to look forward to. Inevitably, I will have a long sigh with the years.</p>

<p>Huiling (1380) 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Eight Immortals Justice Mahjong"</p>
<p>Ten continents and three islands small Penglai. Misty fairy country far away from the mortal world. Strange beasts and rare birds are everywhere. Exotic flowers and herbs fill Yan Mountain. One day, Penglai Island was noisy with sweet voices. I saw that, the Eight Immortals came here to play. That Li Tiegui, took a crutch and walked away. Walking lame and limping. That Han Zhongli, with a broad chest and a wide waist. The fan is busy shaking, looking like a fool. That Lu Dongbin, cut the demon sword inserted on his shoulder. Taoist style fairy wind is indeed extraordinary. That Zhang Guolao, riding a donkey upside down is accustomed to leisurely. White hair Xiao Xiao is not old. That Lan Caihe, a kind of romantic and unrestrained appearance. Often holding a flower basket in his hand. That He Xiangu, modern dress newly dressed. Graceful and beautiful.

Tiegui said, it is harmless to relieve boredom and talk with hands. Guojiu Zhongli said well. Zhang Guolao, praised and clapped his hands like thunder. Four people entered the game with much joy. After four circles, the seat was turned. Tiegui said, the south wind shoots out the west wind and descends. And, the rope also adds dark fortune. Zhongli is, the rope is completed in one color. It turned out that he was also a big three turn. Guojiu's, sitting on the north wind just touching. Stroke white board and add lift. They are, if they come to nine elements and all reconcile.

<h3>"Chick Swallow Cries of Woe" Premieres Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the film "Naughty Miss" was released, the child star Jin Huishu's name has become a global sensation, becoming a strong rival to Shirley Temple. Now, her new work "Chick Swallow Cries of Woe" This is The Life, is scheduled to premiere tomorrow (Sunday) at the Grand Light Cinema. In this film, Jin Huishu plays an orphan with no father or mother, who unfortunately falls into the hands of villains. They teach her singing and dancing skills, forcing her to perform on stage to provide for their squandering. Although the orphan's fame is widely spread due to her rapid advancement in acting, she is, after all, a naive and innocent girl who possesses only a false reputation and fails to receive natural affection. The pain in her heart is beyond words. On the screen, we can not only enjoy Jin Huishu's magnificent singing and dancing scenes but also be deeply moved by her acting, which expresses both joy and sorrow.</p>

<p>Jiang Zhe Bank Building Completion and Opening Commemorative Special Issue</p>
<h3>Editor's Foreword</h3>
<p>The Jiang Zhe Bank Building has gone through a construction period of two years and has only completed its final work today. That towering, magnificent new building at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Tianjin Road is the Jiang Zhe Bank Building that has been completed after two years of work.</p>
<p>Today is the first day that the bank has moved into its new building to conduct business. This is a day worth commemorating! We review the glorious history of the bank in the past, and it has completed a great mission in its gradual progress. Today, while we celebrate, we have even greater expectations for the future of the bank.</p>
<p>As a member of the Shanghai Banking Association, the bank upholds a stable business policy, uses its strong capital to support the advancement of industry and commerce. The bank's chairman Wu Qiding and directors Chen Jian'an, Du Yuesheng, Zhu Kongyang, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Yicai, Jin Tingsun, Sheng Pinchen, Liu Jisheng, Xu Boxiong, Zhou Wenrui, etc., are all financial giants. This kind of intelligence and financial strength tells us the fact that the bank has already embarked on a bright road. However, in today's extremely depressed industrial and commercial environment, they must rely on the support of the financial community, which is extremely important. We hope that the bank will, based on its past business policy, make ordinary adjustments to industry and commerce! In that case, not only will society benefit from it, but also the future of the nation will be deeply dependent on it.</p>
<p>Here, the editor expresses its infinite blessings to the bank and hopes that it will strive to complete its greater mission!</p>

<h3>The Door and Walls of a House</h3>
<p>— Written by Heng You Pan, Translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>Recently, houses and gardens have generally attracted attention to some extent, but there are still many people who are relatively indifferent to the discussion of doors and walls, which influence the appearance of houses and give the initial impression of houses.</p>
<p>The first thing that pedestrians or visitors on the street notice can be said to be the door and the wall. According to the design of these two, the taste and character of the owner and even the family can also be understood. Some houses are very spectacular and the interior decoration is very clever, but if they give an unpleasant first impression, there will be dissatisfaction with the house or garden.</p>
<p>However, it is not necessary to spend extravagant and disproportionate expenses just to decorate for this purpose. In suburban residences, garden cities, etc. in the United States and Britain, there are absolutely no specially made doors and walls, and some freely open a part of the garden. And to construct these, the first thing to pay attention to is the appearance, that is, low hedges that can be freely viewed from the outside of the garden or simply use fences, only to the extent of marking the boundary.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the doors and walls of Japan have always sacrificed appearance. High, closed walls are built so that they cannot be seen through from the outside and cannot be invaded, with the aim of monopolizing the peace of the residence. Even today, there are still glass shards or fifty nails buried on top of concrete walls. This is also a common occurrence. However, although these are used to prevent intruders, the beauty of the appearance is completely lost.</p>
<p>Today, architecture is gradually being improved, and Western-style architecture is becoming more and more popular, so this should be felt as an error of the earliest era.</p>
