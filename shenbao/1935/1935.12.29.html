<p>— 星</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭暴發繼以華北問題嚴重化美國政治當局於應付國際危機意見頗不一致理想派以爲美國應及早設法避免戰爭之傳染病實際派以爲美國應積極努力和平以迅速結束世界之不安杜戰爭之源求秩序之維持國會開會在邇據日來華盛頓電傳下院外交委員會議員丁凱姆G.HTinkham竟有美國退出非戰公約之議氏謂非戰公約已不復爲維護和平之公約而反足爲引起戰爭之公約含義混淆使人失望意阿爭端美國若實施非戰公約其結果反足破壞美國之中立政策此種驚入之動議使人聯想及一九二〇年間美國倡議國際聯盟而不加入國際聯盟之舊事然美國處此國際局面中欲中途退出已有不可能丁凱姆之議不能視爲美國多數之意見也</p>
<p>非戰公約之缺點誠如丁凱姆所言此約旣不能禁止一切戰爭而又足使美國對於他國間之戰爭發生連帶之關係蓋約中所認爲非法者爲侵略之戰爭而自禦性質之戰爭集體制裁之戰爭在『門羅主議』下及『勢力範圍』內之戰爭均非限制之列美國承認此約中各項保留書無異承認國聯對於侵略國制裁行動之合法無異承認英國爲保持其帝國生命錢而對意宣戰之爲合法無異承認以『自禦』爲口實之戰爭爲合法也且依照歷屆之宣言及解釋美國在此約之下當國際糾紛發生之前有互相諮詢之義　於國際戰爭暴發之後對於因侵略而造成之事實有不予承認之義務侵略國與被侵略國旣有合法與不合法之別則美國欲實施中立法案予二者以同等之待遇其間矛盾鑿柄之處甚明顯也</p>
<p>今羅斯福政府於中立法案之嚴格規定已深感困難下屆國會擬提出中立法之修正案使政府對於侵略國家有相當之限制使美國在非戰公約之下盡相當之集體責任彼孤立主義者認總統此種傾向有使美國捲入戰爭之危險故建議將非戰公約下之輕微義務亦一掃而淸之彼輩之意嗣後美國以外之和平戰爭等問題政府不可再加過問曩者九一八之事發生史汀生致波拉書申明美國態度卽以非戰公約與九國公約爲根據論者謂美國政府隨時可以使非戰公約武裝化以對付破壞和平之國家而一旦與侵略國作戰有此一約在美國不致於孤立無援同時美國對於此約旣負有責任於集體制裁如加破壞亦無以自圓其說也</p>
<p>大戰以還世界之苟安局面賴於數種公約在歐洲有羅加諾等公約在東亞有九國公約然公約之有世界性者唯國聯盟約與非戰公約此二約者皆創於美國之政府當局而得世界各國贊助者美國　加入之公約僅非戰公約及九國公約自日本橫行東亞九國公約瀕於破產非戰公約力量雖弱然此爲美國與世界各國合作之橋樑今並此橋樑亦毀壞之吾人不知美國將何以立足於國羣將何以取信於世界也</p>

<p>巴黎　賴伐爾總理今晨在衆院爲其政治生命舌戰羣儒、各黨議員對賴氏之外交政策、意見紛歧、惟賴氏則力持鎮靜、眾院今晨經過一番辨論後、卽休會至下午三時再開、屆時賴氏將發表其最後辯護演說、至西時則衆院將對其外交政策表决信任問題矣、消息靈通方面咸信、一切須視賴氏能否說服極少數之騎墦派、以資挽救局勢云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　賴伐爾總理今日在衆院發言時、衆院空氣頗爲緊張、社會黨領袖白倫繼起發言　對賴氏痛加抨撀、右翼議員則從中阻撓、社會黨議員憤極、竟起立而對阻撓者揮拳、會議乃暫停、白倫稍　休息、再行發言、謂各國如皆堅决爲國聯後盾、則决無戰事危險、乃賴氏故造戰禍將作之空氣、故應要求賴氏辭職云、左翼議員聞之大鼓掌、中央黨議員萊諾德稱讚央國、而詆斥賴氏政策、謂意國乃侵略國、而英國則爲國聯盟約之擁護者、法國於此二者何去何從、必擇其一云、自極左翼至右翼中央之議員、約佔全院三分之二、聞此警句、無不歡呼、旁觀者指此爲葬送現政府之言論、又有人預料辯論完畢後、賴伐爾政府縱得多歡、亦不過在二十與三十票之間耳、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　今晨九時衆院復開外交辯論、僅有議員十人閣員一人出席、法總理賴伐爾到會頗早、甚形疲乏、蓋夜間預備演詞、未暇安寢也、就現象察之、政府地位甚危、惟許多激進派現尚猶疑、因在預算案未通過時不願推翻賴伐爾政府而引起嚴重政潮、之可能性、賴伐爾之最大政敵柯特氏、現已決定今日不發攻擊賴伐爾之言論、同時反對派已提出動議、謂政府未能使世人對於一九一九年以來法國所遵行之政策發生更明白之信任印象、殊可扼腕、又謂國家安全與國聯盟約之不可分雖、宜首先約慮云、中央黨夏佩台倫則提出信任政府案、謂政府必可一方面尊重盟約、一方面謀取和平、今晨會議發言者皆簡略、後休會至午後三時（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　衆議院頃於今晨賡續討論政府外交政策、歷時三小時、直至十二時零五分、始乃竣事、各議員相繼發表簡略演說、或爲政府辯護、或則反對政府、急進社會黨國會黨國主席台爾博幷提出動議案云、自一九一九年以來、法國政府外交政策、卽以尊重國聯會盟約、爲國家安全基礎、此决政府對於意阿爭端所採取之態度、未能使全世界發生此種印象、殊可遺憾衆院現定於午後三時十分賡續開會、預料須俟至午後四時、始可提付表决、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　本日午後三時、賴伐爾總理兼外長出席衆議院、發表重要演說、對於英國前外相霍爾辭職以來、及英法兩國所提方案失敗後之國際局勢、有所諭列其言曰、「意國政府對於英法兩國所提方案、未以熱誠與諒解之精神、加以研究、此與吾人所期待者、未免相悖、抑　相墨索里尼在邦蒂尼亞新村所發表之演說、亦未足使吾人調處爭端之職責、便利進行吾人己往所作努力、現雖中途受挫但余初不懊喪、則以和平終有恢復之一日故也、今日衆院舉行辯論、余以爲其主要問題有　、卽　余所行政策、是吾與法國利益相符合、　余曾吾背棄法國對國聯會所應採取之約束、　法國目前及今後之安全、是否已爲余所妨害、」以上三點、吾人當求其明瞭、賴伐爾嗣乃說明法國對於制裁辦法業予接受、並已嚴格實施謂「余曾向英國聲明、一旦該國因實施制裁辦法、而受意大利之攻擊、則法國當在海陸空三方、予以援助、余不惜使法國提供此項謊言、自知業已担負重大責任、然比固國聯會盟約所產生之影響、而無可避免者也、余之職責、係以種種方法、使英意兩國間關係趨於緩和　蓋余以爲吾人根據國聯會盟約所祖負之義務、愈益嚴峻、則吾人愈當以種種方法覓求和平解决之辦法、」賴伐爾嗣又援　英國前外相霍爾在下議院所述一語、謂意大利認油禁辦法一旦實施、卽係行使軍事制裁手段、其意義不啻對意作戰云、賴伐爾繼乃稱道霍爾之爲入並謂「英法兩國所提方案、誠已夭折、但和解途徑依然洞啟各國在經濟財政方面所採制裁手段、　性質已甚嚴峻孰敢謂其並無實效乎、吾人倘將制裁範圍加以擴大、則孰敢保衝突範圍不致擴大乎、」賴伐爾嗣對若干人責其背棄國際法律一點、提出答復、謂「國際法律之目的係於事前阻止戰爭之爆發、而事後則限制其影響、實非爲擴大戰爭使之蔓延而設也查制裁手段之用意、亦在恢復和平、惟制裁辦法本身、並非一種目的、而僅係達到目的之一種方法、假若由談判途徑而較易達到目的、則談判不但爲國聯會盟約所許可抑且爲吾人分所應爲、此則國聯會所宜時　記取者也、」賴伐爾嗣因若干人指責法國政府在意阿爭端所採態度、恐法國一旦遭遇侵略之時、他國援助法國之機會、亦因是而有减少之虞者　乃予以答復曰、英法兩國之合作、始終爲歐洲安全之柱石、「英法兩國聯帶一致／幷未因余一人之故、而受妨害、英國將業已擬定之方案、卒予拒絕、余亦幷無怨言、總之、余對已往所爲、幷不後悔、今後不論如何、仍當不屈不撓爲和平而工作也」云云、（十十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　本日午後三時、衆議院討論政府外交政策、首先由總理兼外長賴伐爾發表長篇演說、說明英國前外相霍爾辭職後之國際局勢、並爲政府現行外交政策辯護、正統派領袖萊翁勃侖繼起發言、以熱烈之口吻駁斥賴伐爾之政策、謂其旨在取悅意大利而對國聯會盟約則表示不忠實之態度、此其結果、業已使法國之同盟國、允其是中歐諸小國、爲之灰心、其結論謂、保障法國之安全、固莫善於獲得英俄二國之完全援助云云、次由右派「愛國靑年團」領袖戴廷瑞起言、謂當歐戰之時、英意兩國與法國携手合作、　價值之鉅大誠值得後人追述、故現內閣之於意阿事件宜嚴守中立、不作左右袒、萬一將來擬對意國採取軍事制裁官布動員、而以動員令提交衆院通過，則渠與其同志、决不負表决之責任云戴氏詞畢、急進社會黨黨團主席台博繼起發言、謂賴伐爾之政策、以言擁護國聯會盟約、旣嫌其過於柔弱而於意國抵抗制裁之决心、以及德國乘機漁利之企圖、則反足以鼓勵而獎掖之、台氏乃發結論日、政府採此政策、故急進社會黨黨團對於現內閣、自不能表示信任、言畢、急進社會黨大多數議員一致鼓掌歡呼、觀於急進社會黨議員此項態度、則表决信任問題該黨投票之形勢、大致已可覘矣、至是、中央共和黨黨團主席前財長勒諾起言、略謂德國之主要目的、在離間英法二國之邦交、其於今茲國　危機之發展情形、方注視不懈、是以爲法國之計、萬不宜使英法間之聯鎖、稍形鬆弛、至對於國聯會盟約、則法意友誼雖篤、亦仍當忠實履行、母涉游移云云、是時已爲晚間十時、衆議院卽宣告停會、延至明晨繼續討論、而政府信任案、則定於明日午後舉行票决、綜觀本日各議員演說、其最爲特出者、當推勒諾之詞、勒氏雖屬中央派、但其滔滔發言之時、卽在反對派議員亦歡呼不已、渠之所言、足以影響明日午後表决信任案時之形勢、亦未可知、此在賴伐爾則希望屆時可以獲得二十五票左右之多數云（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 開明書店編輯葉紹鈞</p>
<p>諸位同學，國文科方面，牽涉到的事項很多，我不講訐多的事項，只講一點關於寫作的話，分爲兩次，這一次的題目是「寫作什麽」下一决的題目是「怎樣寫作」我的話對於諸位不會有直接的帮助，就是說，諸位聽了我的話，寫作能力不見得會就此增進多少。我的話對於諸位或者有一點間接的帮助，就是說諸位聽了我的話，把應該留心的留心起來，把應該避忌的隨時避忌，什麼方面應該用力就多多用力，什麽方面不必措意，就不去白費心思，道樣經過相當的時候，寫作能力自然漸漸增進了。</p>
<p>「諸位現在動手寫作，大槪分以下的幾個方面，國文敎師按期出題目敎諸位煉習，諸位就要寫作了，聽了各鬥的功課，有的時候須要作筆記、做了各種的試騐，有的時候須要作報吿，諸位就要寫作了，游歷了一處地方，想把所見所聞以及自己的感想記載起來，離開　家屬和親友，想把最近的生活情形吿訴他們，諸位就要竊作了。有的時候從種種的觀感凝結成一種意境，只覺得一定要把這種意境化爲具體的文字，或者用詩歌的形式，或者用小說故事的形式，心裹才暢快，於是諸位也就要寫作了。</p>
<p>以上幾方面的寫作材料都是諸位生活裏頭所原有的，不是從諸位生活以外去勉强拿來的換一句說，這些寫作材料都是諸位自己的經騐。我們平時開口說話，從極簡單的「吃過飯了」，「這本書很不錯」，到極繁複的對於一件事情的評論，對於一件事情的推測，無非根據着我們自已的經騐。因爲根據着目己的經騐，所以能够說得頭頭是道，沒有一句多餘的廢話，沒有一句瞎七搭八的無聊話。如果超出了我們的經騐範圍，郤去空口說白話，如沒有一點天文學的知識，偏要講星辰怎樣地運行，沒有一點國際政治經濟的學問，偏要推斷意阿戰爭中日交涉的將來，一定說得牛頭不對馬嘴，徒然供人家作爲嗤笑的資料。一個人如有自知之明，總不肯作這樣的傻事，超出了自己的經騐範圍去瞎說亂說，他一定知道自己有多少經騐，什麽方面他可以說話，什麽方而他不配開口。在不配開口的塲合竟不開口，這並不是一件難爲情的事，正是量力而行保守分寸的一種美德。經騐範圍是條波紋一樣的，越來越擴大。待擴大到相當的時候，本來不配開口的配開口了，那就開口，也並不嫌邊呢。作文原是說話的延續，所以救濟說話之窮，在說話所及不到的塲合，我們就執筆作文。故而作文自然應該同說話一樣，單就把經騐範團以內的事物作爲寫作村料，不可把經騐範圍以外的事物勉强拉到筆底下來。照諸位現在動手寫作的幾個方面看，所有寫作材料都是諸位自己的經騐，這正是非常順適的事。願諸位永遠順着這個傾向走去，道是一條平坦的大路。</p>
<p>前面這層意思，好像很平常，其實很關重要，爲什麽呢？因爲對於寫作的熊度，就從這上邊立定下來。知道寫作原是說話的延續，寫作材料應該以自己的經騐爲限，這就把寫作看作極尋常可是極嚴正的事。人人要寫作，正同人人要說話一樣，豈不赴極尋常？不能超出自己的經騐，不能隨意亂　，豈不是極嚴　？這種態度是正常的，抱着　種態度的人，寫作對於他是一種有用的技能。另外還有一種態度，把寫看作極特殊可是極隨便的事。這從從前書塾裏的情形來看，更可以明白。以前書塾裹，學生多或十幾個，少或三叫個，這些學生並不個僩作文，將來預備學工學商的，讀了幾年書也就算了。只有預備應科舉的幾個，到相當的時候才開始作文。開始作文稱為「開筆」，那是一件了不得的事，開了筆的學生對於先生要加送束修，家長對人家說「我的小孩子「開筆」了」，臉上往往露出得意的笑容，這些為什麽呢？因為作了文可以應科舉，將來的飛黃騰達，都種因在這上邊，所以大家認為一件極特殊的事，這特殊的事並且是屬於少數人的。再看開了筆作些什麽呢？不是「溫故而知新說」就是「漢高祖論」新呀故呀翻來覆去纏一陣就算完了篇，隨隨使便抓住漢高祖的一件事情，把他恭維一頓或者唾駡一頓，就是出色的佳作，尤其是大家所恭維的偏耍唾駡，大家所唾駡的偏要恭維，這　做「翻案文章」，更可以吃先生的一陣濃圈。這些村料大部分不是自己的經騐，無非仿效着別人的腔調，堆砌一此毫不相干的意思，說得壊一點，簡直是鸚鵡學舌，文字游戲。從這條路徑發展開去，這就來了專門拼凑典故的文章，無病而呻吟的詩詞。自已的經騐是這樣，寫出來的却並不這樣，或許竟是相反的那樣。寫作同實生活脫離了關係，只成爲裝點生活的東西，又何貴乎有這種寫作的技能呢。所以說，這種態度是極隨便的，到現在，科舉雖然廢掉了，作文　然從小學初年級就要開始，可是火家　於寫作的態度，還沒有完全脫去從前那種弊病。現在個個學生要作文，固然不是少數人的特殊的事，但往往聽見學生說，「我沒有意思，沒有材料，拿起一枝筆簡直寫不出什麼來」，或者說，「今天又要作文了，眞是討厭」！這些話語表示一種誤解，以為作文是學校生活中的特殊的事，而且須離開了自己的經騐去想意思，去找材料，自己原有的經騐好像不配作為意思，充當材料似的。再從這裏推想開去，又似乎所謂意思所謂材料乃是一種說來很好聽，寫來很漂亮，但是不和實生活發生聯繫的花言巧語。這種花言巧語必須費了很大的力氣去搜尋，像獵犬去搜尋潛伏在山林中間的鳥獸。搜尋未必就能得到，所以有拿起一枝筆寫不出什麼來的時候，積了幾决寫不出什麽來的經騐，就覺得作文眞是一件討厭的事。其實抱着這樣的態度作文，即使每一回能够寫出什麽來，也不是値得歡慰的事。因為作文同說話一樣决不是把一些說來很好聽，寫來很漂亮的花言巧語寫在紙上就算完事的，必須根據自己的經騐，從實生活裏流注出來，那才合乎所以寫作文的本意，像這樣離開了自已的經騐而去故意搜尋，雖然搜尋的工夫也許很麻煩，但是我們不能不說他把作文看得太隨便了，看得特殊，又看得隨便的態度，使作文成為一種於人生無用的技能，所以非改變不可。諸位不妨自己想想：自己把作文認作學校生活中的特殊的事嗎？自己　開了自己的經騐故意去搜尋虛浮的材料嗎。如果不曾，那就再好沒有，如果確會這樣，而且至今還是這樣，那就請立刻改變過來，改變到正常的態度，就是把作文看得尋常又看得嚴正。抱着正常的態度的人，决不會說沒有意思，沒有村料，因爲他决不會沒有經騐，經騐就是他的意思和材料。他又决不會說作文的事眞是討厭，因爲作文是他生活中的一僩項目，好比說話和吃飯各是生活中的一個項目，無論何人决不會說話和吃飯眞是討厭。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c185">中國籃球房水洩不通　良華昨爲海賊所敗 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>卅一比卅五分球迷大爲失望</p>
<p>三勝一負良華明日離滬北返</p>
<p>良華對海賊、咋晚在申園籃球房作離滬前之臨去秋波比賽、亦即是與海賊作最後之較量、滬地人士、慕兩隊技能之深造、雖處茲風雨霏霏中、成羣結隊、向僻靜之延平路進發、球房中竟充塞至三千餘之多、處身其間、幾有呼吸維艱之概、洵屬空前之盛况、</p>
<p>球迷三千</p>
<p>按此賽吸引力之如此偉大、厥因海賊隊縱橫申江、經已五年、滬上華隊之遭其蹂躪者、不知幾多度、良華五虎、在前晚以五十對四三之比、將其打敗、兩載宿恨、雪之一旦、故咸欲一瞻丯采、俾悉究竟、更兼門票僅售半元、定價低廉、有以致之、即如各報記者、亦均被擯門外、無法入塲矣、</p>
<p>勉強開賽</p>
<p>探悉昨晚門券、於四時以後、即有人前往購買、六時許即已售罄、塲中即已擁得水洩不通、被阻於竹籬笆大鬥外之觀衆、愈聚愈多、竟排　衝入、秩序無法維持、待開賽時、觀衆已立於越過邊錢二尺餘、於茲侷促情况下、勉行比賽、</p>
<p>羣雄頷首</p>
<p>聞良華隊將於明日離滬北返、此番再度臨滬、綜核與中西勁旅劇戰四塲、先勝麥令、繼克暨南、復又勝海賊、昨則挫於海賊、三勝一負、戰績斐然、協進會特贈銀杯一座題「羣雄頷首」四字、以誌紀念、</p>
<p>屈居下風</p>
<p>良華海賊昨晚第二次賽於申園籃球房中、直至八時始能開賽兩軍在人頭擠擠中、開始接觸、海賊諸將、旗開得勝、一路領先、始終佔着先茅、良華雖努力追趕、上半時卒以十一對十九屈居下風、三千球迷、在興高采烈中、無不頓感不快、下半時良華誓不甘伏、着着上進、最接近時爲三十三對三十、相差僅三分、但結果仍以三五對三一失敗、裁判員瞿鴻仁、檢察員沙利文、</p>
<h3 id="c186">西靑籃球希望减弱　曁南敗於麥令 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>一球之差三九比四一</p>
<p>罰球不中失敗之主因</p>
<p>昨晚麥令對暨甫之西靑籃球甲組賽、在極興奪之局面下、麥令賴阿巴達加最後三十秒鐘之一擲、以四十一比三十九戰勝暨南、麥令之勝、全恃其身軀之修長、籃下刦球、使暨南無法阻擋、遂造成此種緊張局面、暨南在西靑賽中、昨爲其第一次失敗、不料敗得如此可惜、如此不幸也、戮力奮鬥、敏捷銳利、殊可讚許、但投籃欠有把握、罰球亦均失之交臂、在麥令十五次犯規中、僅中六分、在理想之新進球隊中、實不應有此缺憾、昨晚之敗、此爲主要原因之一、</p>
<p>戰情激烈興奮</p>
<p>上半時二十五比十九、暨南勝六分、表演美妙、戰情激烈、王南珍以十二比十超出後、從此一路順利，不料下半時起、麥令連得十一分之多、但暨南不稍示弱、憑其驍勇之鬥爭、仍由平等而超出、待麥令再度佔先時、暨南極力反攻、情緒之激烈興奮、不下於前明良華與海賊之戰、最後暨南卒造成各三十九之平數、在緊張之搏戰中、麥令之阿巴達加、在斜側向背後隨意拋出一球、竟然妙中籃心、待中間跳球、時間即隨之而終、於是暨南慘敗矣、</p>
<p>投籃須下苦功</p>
<p>暨南在本屆西靑賽中、爲碩果僅存之華隊常勝軍、亦被認爲最有希望之球隊、足與海賊一决雌雄、昨晚一敗、遂使海賊獨占鰲頭、冠軍希望益厚、但暨南之前途、尙有光明再現之可能、以猛進中之麥令斯、頗有擊敗海賊之望、而暨南亦須與海賊一戰、！能獲勝、則仍可揚眉吐氣、惟該隊對於投籃必須痛下苦功、而於罰球尤須特別注意、勉之勉之、</p>
<p>暨南佔先六分　開賽後麥令一罰一擲、先獲三分、暨南酈王二將照樣還敬、瓊生再中、韓振元籃下托入、造成五比五、繼成七比七、而十比十、王南珍遠射成功、遂以十二比十初露頭角、經此暨南精神奮發、氣燄加熾、韓鄺尹各建奇功、以十八比十一威脅麥令、別利士追上四分後、　耀雅又加二分、以二十三比十五之差、極盛一時、麥令賴長脚葛立芬瓊生之力、造成十九比二十五、結束上半時、暨南以六分佔先、</p>
<p>最後功虧一簣</p>
<p>列陳再戰、暨南疏於防禦、實亦因對手身高手長、無法招架、動輒犯規、麥令一鼓作氣、連得十一分之多、二十五比三十、暨南反屈其下、麥令鋒芒大盛、暨南禍不單行、蔡演雄忽於斯時罰出、易以許榮水、力襲奮取、亡命奮鬥、尹　還以眼色、造成二八比三十、韓振中兩罰不中、嘆聲不絕、王南珍心殊不甘、施以遠射、果然中的、遂成平手、加以尹貴仁之半塲遙射、錦上添花、反又以三四比三二超出、安知麥令利用長人包圍籃下進攻、暨南竟無辦法、俄而麥令又以三十九比三十四勝、暨南最後掙扎、自三十九比三十九後、麥令阿巴達加亂拋一球、竟判勝負、觀者咸爲暨南嘆惜不止、</p>

<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>在首都的水西門外，有一架大石橋，那橋的兩頭，有不少衣衫襤褸的孩子們。這些孩子們，終日的站立在橋的兩頭，因爲他們也有他們的期望。他們的期望是什麼？那就是等待一般提籃子的小本營業者，以及推手車的送煤炭人過橋，他們便可從中偷取，甚至明搶。</p>
<p>在某一天下午，我會親眼看見有一個提着籃子賣鷄蛋的婦人，被這些孩子們偷了不少的鷄蛋，因為他們偷取的手腕非常巧妙，所以那婦人兀自沒有覺察。直待過路的人吿訴伊以後，那籃的鷄蛋，已經被偷掉二十多個了！這婦人血本攸關，不禁放聲痛哭！</p>
<p>這種現象，似乎是社會上的一個重要問題吧？希望警察當局們予以注意。</p>

<p>飛魚能離水而飛，大慨是爲避敵的特別妙法，據說水中有很大的魚，想吃飛魚，所以我看好幾十次避難的飛魚飛出水面，以尾撥水而躍入空中，一對胸鰭，幾乎和身體同長，展張如翅，支持着身體在空中作三四次的波形運動，後離出發點十餘丈遠，仍還入水中？</p>
<p>呵！不幸的飛魚，飛於空中雖避去水裹强敵，但，空中亦有成羣的鷗烏，眈眈地伺候着，因之，我也曾看見好幾尾的飛魚被犧牲了。世之弱小者，眞是到處無樂土啊！</p>

<p>在寒冷的冬之晨，我們興化人的習慣，每天起身後，對於洗臉，漱口，飲茶等事，都需要熱開水，熱開水必須向茶水爐冲買。茶水爐燒的是蘆草，磬糠，天越冷，水越寒，急切燒不開。人越聚越多，街頭巷尾，凡是有茶水爐的地方，總是熱鬧得擠不開交。冷風颼颼，寒氣襲人，求熱（水）先受冷，一　般買熱開水的朋友，弄得縮頸伸頭，手脚發冷，眼巴巴的望着。這眞可以替那些熱中的脚色，留一縮影，你越是心里熱辣辣的望着，越是給你一瓢冷水，弄得你冷熱不均，眞有哭笑不得之勢。</p>

<p>昨天，我們的泗安城裹在演着「酬神戲」了！</p>
<p>在戲場上，看見一位來自别埠的靑年摩登女子，手裹，牽着一頭矮小的狗！</p>
<p>戲場的旁邊，設着一個牛肉綫粉的食攤，祇見那女人把攤上的牛肉，一塊一塊丢向狗的嘴裏！</p>
<p>終於，那女人從皮篋裏掏出一張二角的輔幣劵走了。</p>
<p>這時，旁邊坐在地上的兩個乞丐，看了那得不艷羨！所以一齊追蹤上去乞求着：「小姐！做做好事！」可是竟一無所得！</p>

<p>時間：十二月某日下午四時五十二分。</p>
<p>地點：　　國貸公司。</p>
<p>一個淸秀的中年人在朝南的櫥櫃上選擇羊毛襯衣。披着華達呢外套，靑灰色呢帽，緞子小圓口鞋子，雖然够不上稱「一表人才」，但也總是一個有身家的人了。</p>
<p>但是他却偷起東西來，他乘　間想把柔軟雪白的羊毛襯衣塞在外套袋子裹，不料陣上失風，給一個店員瞥見了，於是幾個人搶上前來扭着咆哮着，其餘的店員也吶喊助威，大呼捉賊！</p>
<p>他囁嚅着，說不出話，祇含含糊糊地說：</p>
<p>「我要買，我要買的……」</p>
<p>但他終究給一個店員扭到經理室去了。</p>
<p>我默默地想：漂亮人都是聰明的，而爲歹作惡，也都是聰明人的份。</p>

<p>在公共汽車或是電車裏，男女讓坐差不多是習見的事情，幷沒有什麼稀罕。</p>
<p>讓坐本來是西人的風氣，我們貴同胞，富於傲效性，讓坐是一種美德，能够摹倣，當然不能算壞。</p>
<p>可是，我們對於這些讓坐者，再仔細一審別，他們所讓的坐，都是讓給一班摩登女郎，那足伶仃的老太婆，無論怎樣立不住，絕沒人會客氣。像這樣的情形，隨時隨地可以看見，讓坐的美德，在時髦的人們，或許應當如此，咄咄怪事！</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>前天到動物園去，在文廟路上看見一個女人，把個不滿周歲的孩子，衣服剝得精光，藏在胸脯口，跪在地上哭泣，走過的人，都把銅元給她，爲的可憐這孩子赤着膊吹在風裏。在我們的那條馬路上，時常有一個年靑的乞丐，身上背了八十多歲的一個娘，頭髮灰白，披着麻袋，向人狂呼「我的老娘」而求乞，大家都會給錢與他，爲的是可憐他的老娘。前者利用孩子，後者利用老母，那個年靑的女人和强壯的男子，不是都好做工，做小生意來養活孩子和老娘嗎？然而總沒有利用老小來乞錢的容易而不費力呢。</p>

<p>— 醉樵</p>
<p>廣西路到了晚上八點鐘的時候，人行道上就歇下一副大衆食擔兒，那許多苦力與車夫，就攏來你買幾個銅子的飯，他買幾銅子的粥，小菜是奉送不要錢的，於是那一羣飢餓者，圍立而大嚼，飽了肚皮，又和惡環境去奮鬥；的確，這大衆的食担兒，是他們唯一的仁慈上帝了！</p>
<p>在咋天陰雨綿綿的晚上，他們照例在那兒露天果腹，遠遠走來一位挺胸突肚的巡捕老爺，一副莊嚴的而孔，已足使他們不寒而慄了！「媽的，去，到行裏去，外國地界是不准賣的」，那食擔主人就差哭了，不住地哀求着：「饒饒我吧，小本生意很苦惱的」！「媽的，不行，行裹去！」强項者在咆哮着：那些苦力與車夫，羣來哀懇道：「請你放了他吧；否則，我們就得挨餓的，你老做做好事吧」，食擔主人，哭喪着臉，顫着喉音，邊奪着在他手裹擔上的繩子，邊說：「吃飽了他們的肚皮，我的一家老小才得飽呢！饒我一决吧」！</p>
<p>這一幕慘劇，我終於不忍朝下看了；而且巡捕老爺，又和老虎吼着似的，「去去！看什麼」？但是我想眼前這些片斷，我可糢糊了，在中國地方，中國人不好做買賣？同是中國人，彼此恃强凌弱，在中國已司空見慣，不過在他嘴裏說出外國地界來，可就是怪事！誰說都市是文明的？簡直都是一隻不懂人道的野獸啊！</p>

<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>前晚，我晚餐後閒着沒事，偕周子寰宇，許子伯堅逛馬路，邊談邊走，走到虹口臨平路相近，遙兒一家朝北鬥面的店鬥口，張着一個紅綠顏色極大的「布擋風」，正乘風搖動着。</p>
<p>走近一看，乃是一家「湖廣麪店」，奇極啦，那面「布擋風」，却是用「國旗」製的，「靑天」「白日」，也很完整，就是「滿地紅」，也一點沒有殘缺，不過那顏色略爲黯一些罷了。</p>
<p>我不見則已，見之痛心！因聯想到外國人對於「國旗」，是多麼的「敬重」？影戲裹有時碰見到本國的「國旗」就要起立致「敬」，我們中國人，別說對國旗致敬，現在竟把它做爲擋風，外人見之，怕要竊笑於後哩。</p>

<p>我每次在馬路上閒逛，常常會看見駛過運貨汽車上面的小工們，沿路戲弄街旁行走的婦女，不是吐涎沫，就是扔爛泥，乘入不備，任意施行惡作劇。你如果要和他辦交涉，那他的車子，早已離去遠了。</p>
<p>今天在街上買物歸家，行經極司非而路，在梵王渡公園的動物院入口處相近地方，見有一輛裝載磚頭的運貨車駛過，車上的小工，竟笑嘻嘻的，對正在街旁行走的兩個姑娘說：「噲！阿姐，夜間到你家裹來往夜」。而兩個姑娘，却低頭不響。</p>
<p>我心中想：小工們　種舉動，無論是吐涎沫，扔爛泥，或是說下流話，歸根結底是我們中國教育不普及，人們缺少智識的表現。</p>

<p>— 白口</p>
<p>昨天下午我因爲沒有功課，就乘便上北平圖書館去走一趟。入座以後，我照例的向兩旁打量一番，結果就看到靠窗坐着的，是一位老頭子，年紀約六十左右，身上穿着長袍馬褂，戴着深度的近視眼鏡，他面前放着一本線釘的木版書，注意力很集中的在看。坐在他旁邊的是一位妙齡女郎，臉上薄施脂粉，身上披着皮大衣，摩登氣味十足，在伊面前放着的，是一本從外國來的原版書，也在很起勁的看。他們倆人的不調和的情形，好像是象微着什麼事情將要發生似的。</p>
<p>在起初的幾分鐘內，大家倒也相安無事。後來女郎忽然離開座位，一直走到窗前，豁的一聲把關着的窗門開了，伊開窗的原因，雖然沒有宣佈，據我推想，大概因爲伊身上的衣服穿得太暖，希望借風來凉快一下；或者是因爲室內空氣太不　鮮，打開窗來換換空氣。總之，不論伊　窗的原因如何，窗子一開以後，呼呼的寒風就立刻從窗門進來了；老者的身上就聞始發顫起來，他看書的集中注意力就不能繼續維持下去，他於是慢吞吞的起來把窗門關上。他關窗的原因，顯然是怕冷。給坐在他旁邊的女郎一見以後，就立刻站起來，走到窗前，把窗鬥依舊打開。從伊臉上的表情看來，心中是着實有點冒火，好像是說：「你這老傢伙，也敢同我來作對」。老者一看窗門又開了，顯然同自己的利益衝突得太利害，臉上不免也有些怒意，於是叉起來把窗門關上，表示弱者也有反抗的精神。女郎見了以後，立刻起來，走到窗前，把窗門拍的一聲重又開了。伊的脚步是比以前沉重，行動也比較粗暴，顯然是發怒了。老者一見，也不示弱，立刻撲的一聲，又把窗鬥關上，表示出老當益壯的精神。女郎見了，簡直氣壞，立刻又把窗門開了。老者見了，又起來關上。如是一開一關，一直繼績下去；所可怪者，他們倆的臉上，雖然表示出勢不兩立的神情，可是始終未發一言，仍舊靜靜的從事他們一開一關的工作。我在旁邊看了，不覺好笑，但爲我自己　利益起見，我本想站在老者的一方面加入戰團。但轉念一想，他老年人要關窗，無非爲怕冷，像我這樣年靑的人，也怕起冷來，未免太不像話，結果是採取中立的態度。他們一開一關的工作，仍舊在繼續着，假使不是圖書館管理員來調停，恐怕現在還在繼續進行。因爲雙方各不相讓，管理員調停殊感棘手，後來他　議一個折衷辦法，就是：「窗鬥半開半關」。一場風波，才吿中止。但呼呼的寒風，依舊從半開的窗門繼續進來，老者的身上不停的戰抖着，一般沒有利害關係的閱書者，自始至終，都張着眼作壁上觀，沒有一個肯發表一點公平的論調。於是在下不禁喟然　曰：「折中辦法，還是弱者吃虧」。</p>

<p>— 其中</p>
<p>遺失東西，遺失的一定是　物，而且還是隨身携帶的，比方像筆，書籍，皮夾，錶，手帕之類。假使這些東西安置着失掉的，那便是失竊，决不能稱之爲遺失。如果失去了動物而稱之爲遺失，這眞是笑話了！</p>
<p>我在嘉輿路上，曾見到電桿上貼着紅紙的「尋馬」廣吿，說是遺失一匹馬，我覺得這位撰廣吿文字的先生，一定文墨不大淸楚的，所以「遺失」與走失會弄不明白。想不到，無獨有偶，六日的上海某報，新聞中有了「李子彬找尋遺失女孩一名」的標題，不知這位李先生的女孩，是石刻的還是木刻的，是放在衣袋中遺失的？還是和別的東西一同挾在臂下遺失的？如果是活的動物。那麼，不是走失，便是拐失，稱之爲遺失，似乎終不大對吧！</p>

<p>— 白衣</p>
<p>爪哇原為中國茶之市場，巳如前述。但目前華茶之輸出爪哇馬都拉二島，一九三四年僅八萬，二千五百八十基羅，價值僅八萬九千一百二十四盾。而同期日本台灣茶之輸入爪哇則達一百四十四萬九千零五十一　羅，　值一百四十五萬二千二百零一盾，與中國茶之輸爪哇租去殊遠。按一九三三年華茶　爪哇尚有二十一萬基　，　值二十三萬盾，但時僅一年，而劇减約三分之二。　　茶輸爪哇以急激减少者，最大之原因固在爪哇本國產茶激增，但日本台　茶之得以大量輸入，可知其尚有其他之要因。　要因維何，即受外匯之影響也。</p>
<p>北菲洲原為中國綠茶之市場，然自一九三〇年後亦為日本綠茶侵入。當一九二八年，日本茶業組合中央會織，為發展綠茶之販路計，派鳥居作久氏赴菲推銷，在一九二九年即有一一千零九十八磅之輸出，但此僅為機品，　翌年一即輸出一萬四千磅至九九三一年，激增至四十一八萬磅，至一九三二年竟　增至一千一百六十五萬磅·一九三二年比一九三一年僅一年間已激增約二十五倍·日本常時所取之手段頗值得我人注意，當日本在一九一零年以綠茶輸向摩洛哥時，因其品質遠遜中國茶，不合於當地市場，故大　混以我國茶約七分之三或四比六之比率，並均用　茶名號混售·然至翌年，因其形式品質各加增進，以致日本綠茶得以單獨發展，是年摩洛哥全輸入量二零％·同時其價格比華茶為廉，每磅可較廉一·　辨士至　辨十·以上為　茶市場之失去與狹小之直接原因。</p>
<p>四，中國製茶業技術落伍之情形</p>
<p>國際新興產茶國之與中國競爭之情形已如前述。但中國茶因地理之關係，其品質實為世界之冠，為何反不及後來居上者之錫蘭，日本，印度，爪哇等茶，而反為其侵蝕中國茶之固有市場？其原因：　一，為中國貨幣巾價為世界列强所左右，在</p>
<p>世界普遍　行通貨膨脹之際，中國滙兌上</p>
<p>失却平衡，以致對外貿易通體無起色。蓋</p>
<p>中國為銀本位國，世界列强均為金本位國</p>
<p>，中國所用之銀，在各金本位國視為一貨</p>
<p>物而已。故在金價增加時，亦即銀價低落</p>
<p>時，反之在金價低落時，銀價則反為上漲</p>
<p>。世界列强為本身打算，要求輸出貿易發</p>
<p>達，實施貨幣貶值政策，於是銀價隨之增</p>
<p>高，中國輸出品在海外之市價亦隨之增高</p>
<p>其銷路自然漸减。　二，為中國製茶之技術尚未臻改良之境。大</p>
<p>都仍沿用手工業之方式生產。故在數量上</p>
<p>不能與新興產茶國之生產類成正比例。在</p>
<p>質量上亦祇多保守原有狀態。同時商人之</p>
<p>惡習未除，如茶中攙水以求重量增加，茶</p>
<p>中染色以求欺騙消費者。</p>
<p>關於前一原因非茶之本身問題，故在此處無庸多事解釋。以後祇希望中關政府當局以政治之力量努力國際匯兌平衡。關於後一原因，實　目前茶業問題中之問題。蓋如果此茶之本身問題得以解决，則華茶尚有向世界市場捲土重來之希望也。</p>
<p>為明瞭中國制茶工業目前之情形，特將有名之各地製茶情形略述如后：</p>
<p>（安微）安徽為中國產茶最富之區。據寶業部工商防問局調查：二十年全省茶之產額為二十九萬三千七百担。皖省祁門紅茶制法，因借日光，故萎凋興醱酵，不甚良好，目因熱度過高，用沸水沖泡，時有日光臭味。同時在近年來，皖省茶戶以市况不振，每將茶芽　至六七寸長，連莖幣葉，一同摘下，祇求量而不計其質。又皖省綠茶製法，向川鐵鍋炒靑，或置日光曝曬，故其色澤香味，均不良佳，皖省政府在最近始設之　範茶場於霍山，仿傚日本綠茶製法。以機器製茶。然目前皖省大部份仍以手工制茶。</p>
<p>（浙江）浙江七十五縣均產茶。據浙建設廳報吿，浙江全省茶葉生產額年約二十餘萬担。但浙省茶之製法，仍沿舊法。即將新採茶葉置諸釜中炒過，及至水分乾去十分之叫，取出置於竹簾，以手揉圓，重炒或置焙籠烘之，即成。浙名茶龍井茶之製法亦然，惟略為精密而已</p>
<p>（江西）江西產茶區域達五十餘縣。赣茶行銷海外之歷史甚長，據茶商報告，光緒三十一二年間每年輸出赣寗紅茶約十九萬箱，花香約二十餘萬箱，全省合計約有五十餘萬箱。可見其盛况。後受外茶如錫蘭，印度等茶競爭之影響，遂逐漸低落，而至一蹶不振。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c237">現實主義與未來主義 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 長鳴</p>
<p>既應把握現實，又當注視未來，這在一般的場合上說，是我們處世的正確的人生哲學，絕不成什麼問題。所成為問題的，只是怎樣去把握現實和注視未來，以及應當把握的是什麼現實，和應當注視的是什麼未來的問題。並且，如果我們對於現實與未來都能加以適當的把握和注視，則這兩者却也並不是完全矛盾的和不可得兼的東西。</p>
<p>把握現實，這是說人們應當注意當前已經現實出來或正在現實的客觀的賓際事態，應當注意已經或能够顯現於我們自身上之切身的實際利害，不要離去客觀的現寶事態和實際利害而落於空想興幻滅。注視未來，這是說人們應當注意客觀事態之推移，從預知其必然的發展中定立我們的遠大的目標，應繼續受新的理想的頒導，去創造我們的新生命，不要只株守着目前的利益或盲目地生存和活動着。的確，人是生活於現實中的，更生活於為當前的現實事物所搆成的現在環境之中。我們離開了自然與社會的物質的現實資料，完全不計及當前的實際利害，我們便立刻不能生存。但是，人不是今天生活了明天就不需繼續生活的，爭取明天的生存是和爭取今天的生存有同等的意義與重要性。因此，在今天的生存中並不應當只計及今天而忘掉明天，為了要預備明天還能够生存，甚至能比今天更生存得美滿些，那麼由預見未來而為未來豎立一種新的理想和目標，甚至有目的地為未來而奮鬥，爭取遠大的新的前稈，就有絕對的必要。因為如此，所以如果是立足於爭取今天的生存上而講現實主義，以及立足於爭取明天的生存上而講未來主義，都是正當的人生哲學。並且因為人是今天生存了明天還要生存，今天就得為明天的生存打基礎，那麼既講現實主義也同時要講未來主義，更是十分正當的。</p>
<p>但是，這不是說一切的現實主義與未來主義都是正確的，應當講求的，實際上只有以社會的集體的利益為依歸，且不拋棄向未來的新生活邁進的理想的現實主義，和能不離開現實世界的要求，與為當前的生存而奮鬥的未來主義，才是值得採取的。在現今的世界裹，對於現實主義與未來主義的講求，都有種種不正確的傾向。在現實主義中，有些人是完全立足於個人主義的立場上去追求現實，只要他個人能够獲得利益和權勢，卽對於自己是有現實的利益的，他便可以不顧別人的利益，甚至不顧歷史上對他自己的將來的評斷和終能給他以未來的不幸的命運，一味的只講求他目前的收獲。另外，更有一種人，便只是叫人們安於現實的生活，不要對現實發生不滿。至於未來的理想，在他們看來却是絕對空虛的幻想。他們是只叫人們盲目地生活於歷史中，使一切人與未來的憧憬完全絕緣。這兩種人在前者是個人主義的純功利主義的現實主義，在後者則是保守主義的現實主義。但這兩者都只是以止步於現實生活的追求為滿足，則是一樣。</p>
<p>對於未來，也同樣有一種不正確的傾向。有一種人是完全離開現實世界的物質生活的追求，甚至離開人間世，而只追求未來的乃至互後的靈魂解脫。這是宗教家用以欺騙和誘惑大衆的未來主義。因為他們教導人們忘却並忍受一切現實的苦痛，反對人們急急於為現實生活的改善而抗爭。他們以為一切幸福與報酬可以在未來，在死後的另一未來世界中獲得：並且現實的痛苦的忍受，正是為了未來獲得善果而預造的因。這種未來主義是完全杳茫的空頭支票，它只在叫人保持現狀而已。</p>
<p>從常識的理解看來，似乎現實與未來是相矛盾的兩個極性，其實它們並不是矛盾的，而且互相補足和依成的。因為沒有現實的滿足，則人類的生存已根本發生了動搖，而未來的生存也就無從說起了。因為今天都不能生存下去，如何還談得到明天的繼續生存呢？所以要明天能生存，要明天能更好地生存下去，則必須以今天的生存為條件，這便是未來須以現實為根據，未來離開不了現</p>
<p>實。反之現在生存了，將來也同樣生存，並且要能更好地生存，然後人類才有進步的意識，才能符合於人類向上的慾求之滿足的意識。要是不然，人類的明日的生存方式還只停留於今日的生存方式的階段，甚至今日生存了明日就再也不能繼續生存，這都不是人類的生活。今日的生存是明日的生存之預備，那麼在今日的生存中便不能不預存着明日的生存之新要求，不能不以明日能繼續生存為目的和理想。所以未來的生存是現實的生存的延續，沒有未來則現實也是無意義的。</p>
<p>因為如此，所以正確的人生哲學，是既能容許人們講求現實主義，也能容許人們同時講求未來主義，並不把兩者看作絕對矛盾不能並立的東西。不過我們必須排除那以個人的功利主義為中心的現實主義，和完全不注視未來，沒有未來的新的理想的現實主義，也同樣要排除那完全不講現實的宗教的出世思想的未來主義，或只叫人忍受現實的痛苦，不思改善，單寄託其甜迷的夢想於將來的未來主義。因為這些都是妨害人類的現實生活之集體的利益的獲得和人類的進步的人生哲學的緣故。</p>

<h3 id="c238">絲廠學徒 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 張昌半</p>
<p>幼年時進過村裹的國民小學，因為家境貧寒不能入高小，於是離開書房，跑到山上牧牛放羊去了。可是這段生活沒有經過多久，便被父親把我送到城裏的一家絲廠充當學徒。那時正當歐戰的結東時期（以後纔曉得的），絲業特別發達，單是我們縣裹也新開了五六家，因為廠數增加，需要很多的後補絲匠——學徒，於是便在城裏和各鄉鎭編貼招收學徒的廣告，而我就是在那時應徵被錄取的許多人中間的一個。</p>
<p>我進的那家絲廠，歷史較久，因為營業發達，加過一番擴充，所以規模也很宏大，在我們城裏要算首屈一指了。裏而共有四百　車，匠人和學徒也有七百餘名。我初去那一天，驟然見着這樣寬大的房屋，心裹確實很高興，在鄉村的茅蓬裹樓息慣了的人，一旦到了這兒，眞像由地獄昇入天堂，於是便跟着父親找到「管理處」。管理主任是個身材矮小的中年人，他向我父親問明了我的姓名年齡，又完淸了「保證」手續後，纔威嚴的對我說：「廠裹的規則很嚴明，你是新來的，格外要小心。」他隨卽命令站在旁邊的管理員：「把他帶到「選兩處」去。」</p>
<p>我誠惶誠恐的跟着管理員走出管理處，同父親分別時都不敢作一種表示。</p>
<p>選繭處原有幾個先我入廠的學徒，他們還做着這種初步的起碼工作。我跟他們學習不到二十分鐘，便知道了「雙頭兩」，「膿胞顢」，「蛾壳繭」，「蛆繭」，「污繭」，都是不能繅絲的壞東西。這工作很間單，很輕鬆，只要眼睛伶俐，手指敏捷，便是一個個選　能手了。</p>
<p>好容易等到「繭市」收場（新繭上市後，絲廠便大批的收買，其中有許多壞繭子都要選擇出來，然後織烘乾以便儲藏），選繭工作纔告完畢，自然我也知道別的工作不見得比這輕鬆，但換一換口味總要覺得興奮一些。以後又由前次那個管理員把我帶到「揚返場」，這項工作也沒有什麼了不得，只將「小或子」上而的絲退到「揚返車」的「大或子上。揚返車很笨重，由幾個力氣大，點的學徒輸流着用手搖轉，像我這樣的「小把戲」，只需耍眼睛注意絲倏不要退過或子或是接接頭而已，等到大或子的絲條收到了一定的分量時，然後把牠擱上烘絲櫃，烘乾後再送到「打把處」，於是工作便</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>算完成了。</p>
<p>在我進廠的第二年，　被派到「練絲塲」這算是真正接觸到學徒生活。縱絲場分東南西北四處，排立成「口」字形，每塲各有百架絲車，又分四行排立。　絲的大半是出了師的匠人，少數則為快要出師的學徒，我們這些小把戲自然沒有「上上車」的資格，只能一個人服役五架絲車，幫着匠人們煮　，換水，生火，添炭，撈屑物，或是掃地和送或子到揚返塲，眞像戲台上的「跑龍套」，丢了這樣換那樣。</p>
<p>廠裏的規定，每天早上五點鐘起床，可是我們總要早半點鐘起來，幫着匠人們煮好　子，給絲鍋滲水，生火，這樣纔能取得匠人的歡心，同時自己也免得臨時慌亂，因為匠人多　一兩絲，便多得一兩的工錢，假如躭擱了他的賺錢機會，是要挨駡受氣的。絲鍋每天要換三次水，每架車一天最少要煮五决　子，同時還要添炭，撈屑物，送彧子。五架車的事情全堆在一個人身上，所以我們差不多一天到晚都在車列間穿來穿去，由繅絲塲跑到煮　室，由揚返塲跑到貯水池，這個匠人在喊，那個匠人又在呌，眞是熱鬧非常。到了夜間十點鐘，匠人便收工睡覺，而我們這些小學徒還要收拾絲鍋，整理屑物，打掃地面，最少也要過半個鐘頭　能鑽進床舖睡覺。</p>
<p>我們睡覺的地方也叫做「宿舍」，數一十人同睡在一間屋子裹，左隣毛厠，右一接「屑物儲藏室」，所以每當暑季，瘟病一，疫疾便耍在廠裹流行。</p>
<p>至於我們的膳食，早餐和午餐都是幹飯，夜膳是稀粥。所謂飯倒是白米，可是吃在口裹沒有米味，而且硬得吞不下喉管。起初我還不明白這是什麼原因，後來　知道米是用石灰水泡過的，是一廚房為了可以多揩油，使人少吃米所想出來的一種方法。</p>

<h3 id="c239">最近世界的石油市塲 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 方寬仁</p>
<p>如果單從市塲的需要來說，在近年的世界石油市場中，的確表現出了些許的需要增加，這主要原因乃是在於世界各國的汽車和飛機以及別的工業的生產之增加。事實上，在一九三三年世界的汽車生產數量雖然還在繼續减少，但在一九三四年時，這减少不僅已經停止，而旦還有顯著的增加。本年度雖還沒有整個的明白的統計，但就各國擴張軍備的情形看來，就過去數月中世界各國汽車生產的情形看來，也可想到世界汽車生產是還在繼續增加的。據統計，一九三四年世界汽車的數量是三千四百九十萬輛，這比較一九三三年計增加了百分乏八；又，一九三四年的敏脂油的需要是六千七百五十萬噸，比較一九三三年也要增加了百分之六·九。</p>
<p>據柏林景氣研究所的發表，最近兩年來世界四大資本主義國家的新製輕汽車的登記指數如：</p>
<p>一九三三年　一九三四年美國一三六·二　一七三·三英國一一九·七　一四八·三法國一〇八·一　一一一·五德國一九九·五　三一八·四</p>
<p>（一九三二年＝＝一○○）</p>
<p>由這個小站的統計，亦可見到去年度世界四大資本主義國家的汽車生產都有顯著的增加：就中尤其是德國顯示出了驚人的增加狀態，這當然是與其努力擴充軍備有密切關係的</p>
<p>至於世界飛機數量之增加、那在這大家都在拚命擴張空軍中，更是用不着說的。但因為各報章雜誌常有關於世界各國的飛機統計，我們覺得在這里沒有再抄統計數字的必要。</p>
<p>照理，世界汽車和飛機生產的增加，以及隨之而發生的石油需要之增加，其結果當可使石油的價格高漲，但事實却是與常理相反的。去年以來，世界石油之需要雖隨汽車和飛機之增加而有所增加，但其償格却現出了顯著的暴落。據本年所發表的，最近數年來世界石油品的價格表示出了如次的情况：</p>
<p>平均價格（一九二九年＝＝一〇〇）</p>
<p>近年來世界石油價格之急劇地暴落，在這個表中已經很明白地表現出來了。但是，石油價格暴落的原因安在呢？這是因為：第一，在爭奪世界殘餘的石油資源和石油市塲中，世界諸托拉斯的爭鬥日益尖銳化。如去年世界諸托拉斯在爭取伊拉克的石油資源中，今年英美意等在爭奪阿比西尼亞的石油資源中，便表現出了無情的殘酷的尖銳鬥爭；又如英美等國之爭奪世界石油市塲的爭鬥，近年來也是在加倍發展的。第二，一般石油需要國為那「石油獨立」的爭鬥還繼績着，還在近年來這些石油需要國的國內資源之努力開發中，在其石油精製工業之發展與夫一切代用物研究之發達中，都可明白看到。第三，由於最近世界各國之一般地極度限制輸入及準備戰爭，所謂「石油自給自足」的現象更表現出了普遍的發展。這些原因的結果，是表現出了石油生產增加而其市塲反為縮小的矛盾現象，因而招來了世界石油市塲崩潰的禍害；並且這禍害絕不因為石油之客觀需要的些許增加而有所和緩。</p>
<p>由於世界石油市塲之崩潰，常然要馬上引起世界石油生產過剩的怪狀。據本年的統計，近年來世界石油的生產額與需要額表示出了如下的供過於求的極不平衡的狀况：</p>
<p>上表所表現的，是近年來世界石油生產和需要都有顯著的增加，但兩者相較，却是生產超過需要，表現出了顯明的生產過剩的現象。</p>
<p>美國是世界石油業最發達的地方，但美國石油的生產超過需要的情况却特別嚴重。在去年，美國雖有石油業法的限制，但其石油生產額仍在繼續增加；如把前年和去年的合算起來，那美國的石油生產是超過了需要一千八百五十萬噸。</p>
<p>除了美國以外，世界各主要生產國家近兩年來的石油生產也在繼續增加。請看下表（單位百萬噸）：</p>
<p>這里所表現的，也可證明最近世界各主要石油生產國的石油生產是在急劇增加。道樣大量的生產增加，當然不是些許的需要增加所能容受的。因之，近年來，除蘇聯有特殊情形外，以美國為首的世界各主要石油生產國差不多全陷於石油生產過剩的危機中了。</p>
<p>因為世界石油市塲的崩潰，因為世界石油的生產過剩所以世界各主要交易所的石油業股票的市價，近年來此較恐慌前（一九二九年前）低落了許多。這是可以由下表中見到的世界各地交易所石油業股業市價指數：（一九二九年等於一〇〇）</p>
<p>在去年度，無論什麼地方的交易所，石油業的股票市價都要較前年的低落。這事實是充分表現了世界石油工業，石油市塲之悲觀。</p>
<p>然而，世界諸托拉斯對於爭奪石油資源和販賣市塲的鬥爭還是有增而已。在這情形下，世界石油市塲想要有起色，怕只有待於普遍全世界的大戰爆發，因為那時石油需要將會大大的增加，過剩的石油生產也可消費在戰爭中了。所以，有人說什麼煤油大王等人物是和軍事工業者一樣，很盼望殘酷的大戰早點爆發的。－這話似乎也有一點理由。</p>

<h3 id="c240">評書劇的表演法 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 理臣</p>
<p>戲劇，我對於這道完全是一個門外漢。特別是中國的舊戲，不但一句也哼不來，而且根本就看得非常的少。最近應朋友之約，偶爾去看了一回舊劇，也使我這門外漢對它發生了一些感想，略有點自以為如此的所謂意見，我想是不妨提出來說一說。</p>
<p>戲劇，跳舞，苦樂雖然在現在同樣是被當作一種　樂消遣的藝術看待，　這三者卻有不同的特徵。因為如此，所以在科學的分類發達了的今日，它們在藝術中都已被區分成了專科了。就它們各自的特徵說，戲劇是較為寫實的一種藝術，因為它是在具體地表演故事中的人物之言語行動的活動過程，甚至是模仿故事中的人物之活動過程。跳舞則不然，它比戲劇要抽象得多，它係以一咱體勢的動作，來綜合地表現某一事態之總的表象，所以它不但不必注重於這過程中的人物之活動的行為的逐一描寫，而是把它縮短，抽象成為觀念上可以意會的象徵，由表演者用體勢表演出來，甚至也直接發揮着表演者所想像的或其自身的感情。所以跳舞雖楚仍如戲劇一樣，是用體勢的動作來表演，但戲劇所表現的是如實的事實和行為過程，而跳舞則只表現其一種觀念化的情景。比如許多野蠻民挨的跳舞，像內革羅族和印第族的戰爭跳舞，就簡省了戰爭的事實而縮短成為一種觀念化的情景的表演了。在野蠻民族的結婚舞和收獲舞中，乃是想像地表演出對於愛情的一快樂，却不一定表演一稱固定的實事和求愛的動作等等。在收穫舞中也是一樣，它只表示對於豐收的歡樂的感情等等。至於音樂，這是不待說的。它乃是人的內心的感情與慾望的發洩。雖然它有時也能體現出一種活的事態之情景，如像我們一聽船夫曲的聲音，即似乎可以隱約地想到那些船夫拉船的動作，想到他們負起沉重的船練，彎腰曲背地，一步一步地，很困難的前行的狀况，甚至可以想到他們由遠而近，又由近而遠，終至不能見人的種種實景，如同眼見一樣。但無論如何音樂所表現的現實情景，乃由內心的感情發露來體現外界的情况，而跳舞和戲劇則係以外的動作去體現內的感情的。因為這樣，所以這三種東西各自的特徵是不同的，近代的眞正的藝術，因此把它們各自獨立化，依着各自的特點去發展它，所以才使它們能成為更科學更藝術的藝術。</p>
<p>中國的舊劇，很顯然的是揉和了這三種東西構成的，它有動作和表白的表演，這就是說它的表演是採取了如實的描寫方法的。它把故事中的人物的行動言語如實地表演出來，模仿着故事中的人物的行為言語，甚至是具體地詳細描出它的事實，這就有單純的戲劇本質的成分包含其中。可是，它在以體勢動作描寫故事中人物的行為時，却叉並不以那人物之現實的活動情形為限，而雜以抽象的意想上的動作之體念的表演。所以在觀衆方面也得從那體勢的表演形態上，去體會出故事中的人物的性格思想等。這即是說，中國的舊劇是把故事中的人物的性格，思想，行為等等用觀念化的情景表演出來的，而不是表演着故事中的人物之如實的動作，因此這裏是包含着跳舞本質的表演法的。事實也是如此，無論是生，旦，醜，末，他在臺上的活動，都多半是用跳舞的方式出之。比如一個武生或黑頭出臺，總是一些大跳大舞，這是用以表示他們之孔武有力，强項威武的本性的。就在行動上，他的步法和行走的姿勢，也是帶有跳舞色彩的，因為在事實上通常的人絕沒有亂跳亂舞和行走動作的方式的。至於中國的舊戲，在言語上主要的是以歌曲為主，而對白在全劇中占得很少，這也不是正規的戲劇表演法。這在用言語一方面，對於描寫事物也並不是如實的，因為在現實的事情中，那裹有把說話當作歌曲唱出來的事買呢？舊戲中的詞調歌曲和演者所唱的聲調，都並不在注重以語言去描寫如實的劇中人的言語，而是在以音樂的聲調去體現人物的人格全形和其內心的情感。比如靑衣的聲調，是被裝做得特別柔媚，卑屈，怯懦，這不但從他的聲音中表明了婦女的軟弱嬌艷，並且十足地表示在封建社會統治下的婦女，怎樣把伊們壓迫成溫雅和順的弱者，成了男子的玩物和馴羊。</p>
<p>從這種種看來，中國舊劇象微的地方太多了，所以大家說它是象徵主義的，其實這種戲劇在實際上並不是單純的可以稱為戲劇的東西，而是戲劇，跳舞，音樂的雜揉品。這種戲劇，若在為了使戲劇與跳舞乃至音樂，能各自專門化科學化方面說，都是不甚適宜的。因為戲劇既重在寫實，則那種把如實的行為動作改成跳舞的方式，把言語的表白改成音樂的方式，這就不容易寫實而使戲劇進步了。比如如果這劇中要演一個刺客行刺，這裏是要以如何機智，敏捷的行動出之，才能表明出那種緊迫，機智，恐慌的如實的狀况來，也才能生動感人，而舊劇中却來一套跳舞亂舞，緊張，機智，敏捷的內容完全掩蔽了，這如何能使那幕劇生色呢？又如在對白的表演中，原來有些含有深奧的道理，或毒辣，深刻的對話，必須用言語才能表明，現在你換成了歌曲來對唱，是很難表白出深刻，緊嚴，毒辣的對白或論爭的實情的。我們從近年來中國白話文的使用的經騐中，證明在有些哲學科學上的辭句，連用文言都不易表達，還不要說想用由歌唱式的辭句，去表白劇中人的對白罷。至於在交談中的聲調之應時的鬆緩高低抑揚等等，更是不容易和唱詞表露出來的。所以中國戲在表白上用唱詞，只有一部分音樂美的意義，並不能如實地表現劇中人的言語實況和精妙的情節，這也是使它難於完成其戲劇的任務而達到科學化的。</p>
<p>自然，我不是說戲劇中完全不能雜以跳舞，音樂，我以為戲劇之難以跳舞音樂，也要在戲劇的寫實中去插用。就是說在戲劇故事中有跳舞歌唱時才用它，如果沒有，則一切表演都就如實的照故事中的人物之可能的動作言語表演，這才能使戲劇科學化，使它成為專門化的單純戲劇。</p>
<p>中國的舊劇，還有一個最大的缺點，就是響器的問題。這不但太過於吵人，而且也不是寫實的，甚至能攪亂人去專心　會劇情。還種響器的音樂價值原就是很低級的，中國劇之所以不能廢除它，大概和它雜用跳舞表演法很有關係。因為它要用鼓　的節奏，也才能調節和約制舞的姿勢和手法，乃至歌唱的音節等等，通常有所謂抓　鼓就是這個道理。所以要廢除響器，恐怕不能不從改變跳舞的表演法起。</p>
<p>中國的舊劇，是很原始的，如果論到它的內容，當然完全是封建意識的產物。至於產生這種戲劇的背景，和它的表演法之象徵主義的特色，究竟有多少用處等等問題，也是值得討論的，不過這沒有多的篇幅來討論，留到以後有機會再談罷。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3 id="c241">論救亡 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 朱君實</p>
<p>任何一個國家的內政外交都寄托在它的政府，一個政府都有它一定的政策，人民授權於政府，政府就應發揮它的能力，為民族國家爭取獨立與生存，若不辜負人民付託之重，人民亦决不能再去掣肘政府施政的步驟。</p>
<p>但是不幸的中國，內憂外患，相逼而來，國勢阽危，至於斯極，最近又因華北發生自治運動，有脫離中央的險象，北平各大學旣下「最後一課」之决心於前，復作轟轟烈烈的救國運動於後，靑年學生為正義而呼號，表民意於萬一，其行動之可歌可泣，可敬可佩，視五四運動實無稍讓。然而，一國政治，政府不能充分發揮其能力，而要靑年學子來加以干預，使他們分散其求學的專心，浪費其寶貴的光陰，實在是一件十分不幸的事！而在中國，這種不幸的事竟會接一連二的發生出來，尤為不幸中之大不幸！</p>
<p>接着平津各大學的大示威，滬漢各處，據報載亦有接踵舉行的報道，這種罷課，游行，口號，標語，等等熱烈的舉動，在非常的時代，要激起大多數人心的巨浪，自然有其相當的意義，但可憐的是民元以來，這種舉動採用的機會太多了，而太多的機會之後，還是老樣的罷課，遊行，口號，標語，不知我們這垂絕的中華，要到何時何日才能使這些手無寸鐵的大衆，永遠可以放棄這種舉動而不用？</p>
<p>假使說，當我們第一决呼口號的時候是在甲午之後，那末六十年花甲輸迴，準備至今，充實至今，尚有什麼不可為？又假使說，我們又一决呼口號的時候是在二十年前袁逆纂竊國器的時期，則十年教訓，十年生聚，又何事不可為？又假使說，北伐軍與之後，我們眞的大家已呼過覺醒的口號了，那末七八年幽長歲月，又何至國防蕩然，百廢　未舉其一？嗣後，濟南滴血，東北淪亡，熱省陷落，時代給我們痛苦的啃嚙至深且巨，然而除了靑年學生的一腔熱血而外，對於國事所能召致者何事？言念及此，不禁椎心泣血，不知涕淚之何從！</p>
<p>我人檢視往昔，對救國運動當更有一層深刻的認識。如上所述，遊行示威，在非常狀態之下足以表示我國真正民意之所在，足以正世界的視聽，寒奸徒的肝膽，其用心良苦，但我們同時也應注意到如何充實救國的賓力來武裝我們的肉體，武裝我們的精神：</p>
<p>一，救國應列為經常的信心　救國大計須沈着應付，决不是憑一朝一夕的努力所克有濟。從前越王勾踐，就依賴了他臥薪嘗膽的經常信心，卒達沼吳的目的。我們在今日欲談救國，也須天天救國，時時救國，刻刻救國；求學為救國，工作為救國，言論為救國，無時不救國，無事不救國，救國是我人唯一的信心。要這樣才能集合絕對偉大的力量，才能眞賓表現救國的實際效能。</p>
<p>二，救國應加厚國家總的實力　卽將來臨的戰爭是科學的戰爭，是智識的戰爭，是整個民族與敵搏鬥的戰爭。今日我國的科學不如人，人民智識不如人，整個國力不如人，故我人今後應一面從事增厚國家實力，一面抱枕戈待旦的决心，準備共赴國難。</p>
<p>三，靑年學生從速將頭腦武裝起來</p>
<p>近日各地救國運動之崛起，使中外咸知我　人心未死，咸知我民族解放的火把卽將作燎原的壯舉，但因此不免有少數未來國家幹才的靑年學生，徒然犧牲於鐵棍刀刺之下，一方面固然使我人感佩他們犧牲的精神，但另一方面，我們想一想「出師未捷身先死」之句，不禁與無限的感愴！所以我以為我們於示威游行之餘，應當轉向大衆羣中去喚醒他們沈迷的惡夢，我們應當自己武裝起自己的腦袋，沈着，苦幹，直至民族獲得解放的時候！</p>
<p>談到救國問題，早就痛心疾首，而處於今日情形下的中國人民要談救國問題，其艱苦更巷百倍。上述種咱，我願以最大的忠誠敬求國人的共鑒！</p>

<p>— 偉人</p>
<p>記得幼年時嘗與小同伴們為了或種緣故起了爭執，受了委屈，以致動起手來，互相毆鬥，弄得臉上抓開了鮮紅的血跡，腿上腫起了一個大靑塊。從此我便與小同伴們絕跡不相交往。</p>
<p>事隔數載，回憶起從前幼年時的情形，往往有使自己發笑的地方。</p>
<p>現在，我走進這社會已有五六個年頭，自己知道氣質與前已大不相同了，以前的一副剛愎自用，驕傲孤僻，不可一世的態度，差不多為社會的洪爐融化了不少。這或許是一件好事，因為現在偶然回到故鄉，一般老長輩會不約而同的稱贊我說：「這孩子識時務了！</p>
<p>世故是人生立世的法賓。俗語說：「不識字，好吃飯；不識天，不識人，就不好吃飯了！」誠然誠然。</p>
<p>大凡要識人，一定要「伺人顏色」，要識天，要「善窺寒暖」。</p>
<p>於是乎，識時務的女人，有肉可賣，就得賣肉；識時務的男人，就不妨賣靈魂。分明說來，只要榮華富貴有着落，走狗奴才未嘗不可為。他們就永遠這樣想：人生一世，所為何來？誰不做奴才走狗，其如上海人所謂「洋盤」了。只要金銀珠寶到得手，一九三六年新式福特汽車有得坐，大理石建築的洋房有得住，大西洋邊新法烹飪可享用，為人妾作玩物，都沒有什麼不可！</p>
<p>總之，誰要不明白這是二十世紀尖銳的新時代，硬抓出忠，貞，節，義的話，實在是迂之又迂，腐之又腐的活僵屍了！</p>
<p>或者，誰要懷恨破壞你貞操的大腹賈，誰要責駡剝奪你自由的主子，斤斤於仇恨之報，則更為不懂「世故」之尤者了。</p>
<p>今日挺聰明的人，要：昨日為「敵」，今日未嘗不可為「友」，昨日他是宰割你的皮肉的人，今日你何妨向他負荊請罪，甚至因他披了你的右頰，不妨再給他左頰。我們看他們「高舉香檳」的時節，一飲而盡，於是親善如初，相視而笑，這裹不是富於「幽默」的意味嗎？</p>
<p>有些不大看透世故眞義的人，往往看見類似如此的事，都以為世事太兒戲，人事太滑稽，然而世事除了兒戲還有什麼？人事除了滑稽還有什麼？兩位先生在大馬路碰了頭，兩下握一握手，「今天天</p>

<p>我近來常常為悲天憫人之念，激起我救世的宏願；想　　　　　　　　　去拯救那些營營不知世故的眾生。因為我深信「順天者昌，逆天者亡」之真理。大好頭顱，即不作順天之用，而有何必故作頭顱，　　　　　　。</p>

<p>「喂！不要嚕囌。又不是我要你的錢。你自己想一想：案情多麼重大！」</p>
<p>「柳主任，我是沒有過錯的人啦！請你開開恩；今兒我給你湊二十元路費，再寬待五天給你送一百元到局上來。——我祗有去借呵！但是……」</p>
<p>糟！鼓了一天勁兒，得「二十元」，不是笑話嗎？一百元欠帳有鳥用？如果是一筆大數倒還可以。</p>
<p>「李老闆。我這人不愛說空話；如果你願意了結這次案子，就趕快拿兩百元現的出來，其餘二百可以緩三天，但是要出紅條。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Hopei-Chahar Negotiations Are Temporarily Stalled; Development Must Await the Return of Doihara to Tianjin; Song Zheyuan to Hold Military Review on New Year's Day; Feng Zhi'an's Troops Ordered to Prepare <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Beiping: It is rumored that Song Zheyuan is scheduled to return to Beiping tomorrow, but related sources say they have not yet received definite confirmation. Song is expected to arrive in Beiping on the 31st, as he will hold a military review at Xiyuan on New Year's Day. Feng Zhi'an's troops have been ordered to prepare. Foreign dignitaries have been notified. Regarding the issues of eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, and Tanggu, after negotiations were initiated in Tianjin by relevant personnel, there have been some preliminary developments. However, because Doihara, the Japanese representative responsible for the negotiations, must go to Changchun to consult with the Kwantung Army, all progress is dependent on Doihara's return to Tianjin. The official date for negotiations is expected to be after New Year's Day. (28th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Hopei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee will suspend its regular meetings before the new year and resume them on January 3rd after the new year. (28th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: A certain country's opinions on the puppet autonomous government of eastern Hebei are not consistent. Some advocate maintaining its opposition to the Hopei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, while others advocate abolishing it to unify the situation in North China. Therefore, there is little hope for a resolution in the future negotiations. (28th day special dispatch)</p>

On the 28th, He Chengjun specially summoned the principals and student representatives of various schools to the provincial party headquarters for instruction. He stated that the Wuhan students' demonstration and parade were orderly, and their spirit of loving the country and abiding by discipline was fully demonstrated. China's industry and commerce are backward, and knowledge is also facing a famine. Young students should emulate Goujian, who used three households to destroy Wu, and destroy Qin by studying and seeking knowledge as a way to save the country. Its effect will be far greater than parades and petitions. I once studied at the Lianghu Academy, when Tsarist Russia invaded and occupied the Northeast. I also served as a representative to petition. If you seek more knowledge, your contribution to the country will be greater. I hope you will think deeply about it. If you have any opinions, you can convey them to the central government through me. Chen Ji, representing the student body, received the instructions, stating that they have complied with the order to prohibit gatherings and associations. The directors of the Education Department, Cheng Qibao, and the Provincial Party Committee, Ai Yuying, also gave speeches.

<h3 id="e27">Is the United States About to Withdraw from the Kellogg-Briand Pact? <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>-- Xing</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War, followed by the serious situation in North China, the U.S. political authorities have held rather inconsistent opinions on how to deal with the international crisis. The idealists believe that the United States should try to avoid the contagion of war as early as possible. The pragmatists believe that the United States should actively strive for peace in order to quickly end the world's unrest, stop the source of war, and seek the maintenance of order. As the opening of Congress approaches, a Washington dispatch reports that G.H. Tinkham, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has proposed that the United States withdraw from the Kellogg-Briand Pact. He said that the Kellogg-Briand Pact is no longer a pact for maintaining peace, but is instead sufficient to cause war, with ambiguous meanings that disappoint people. If the United States were to implement the Kellogg-Briand Pact in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the result would be to undermine the United States' neutral policy. This shocking motion brings to mind the old story of the United States proposing the League of Nations in 1920 but not joining it. However, it is impossible for the United States to withdraw halfway in this international situation. Tinkham's proposal cannot be regarded as the opinion of the majority in the United States.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the Kellogg-Briand Pact are indeed as Tinkham said. This pact cannot prohibit all wars, and it is sufficient to make the United States have a joint and several relationship with wars between other countries. Because what is recognized as illegal in the pact is wars of aggression, while wars of self-defense and wars of collective sanctions are not subject to restrictions under the "Monroe Doctrine" and within the "sphere of influence." The United States' recognition of the various reservations in this pact is tantamount to recognizing the legitimacy of the League of Nations' sanctions against aggressor states, is tantamount to recognizing that Britain's declaration of war on Italy to maintain the lifeblood of its empire is legitimate, and is tantamount to recognizing that wars under the pretext of "self-defense" are legitimate. Moreover, according to past declarations and interpretations, the United States has an obligation to consult with each other before international disputes occur and an obligation not to recognize facts created by aggression after international wars break out. Since there is a legal and illegal distinction between aggressor states and states that have been aggressed upon, the contradiction between the United States' desire to implement neutrality laws and treat the two equally is obvious.</p>
<p>Now, the Roosevelt government is deeply troubled by the strict regulations of the neutrality laws. The next Congress plans to propose amendments to the neutrality laws to give the government considerable restrictions on aggressor states, so that the United States can fulfill considerable collective responsibilities under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The isolationists believe that this tendency of the president has the danger of involving the United States in war, so they suggest that the slight obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact should also be swept away. Their intention is that the government should no longer be involved in issues of peace and war outside the United States in the future. When the September 18th Incident occurred, Stimson sent a letter to Borah, clarifying the attitude of the United States based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. Commentators said that the U.S. government can arm the Kellogg-Briand Pact at any time to deal with countries that undermine peace, and once it goes to war with an aggressor state, with this pact in place, the United States will not be isolated and helpless. At the same time, since the United States has a responsibility under this pact, it cannot justify breaking it for collective sanctions.</p>
<p>Since the Great War, the world's state of precarious peace has depended on several conventions. In Europe, there are the Locarno Treaties and other conventions. In East Asia, there is the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the conventions that are universal are only the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. These two conventions were both created by the U.S. government authorities and supported by various countries around the world. The conventions that the United States has joined are only the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. Since Japan has been running rampant in East Asia and the Nine-Power Treaty is on the verge of bankruptcy, although the Kellogg-Briand Pact's power is weak, it is a bridge for cooperation between the United States and various countries around the world. Now that even this bridge is destroyed, we do not know how the United States will stand in the community of nations and how it will win the trust of the world.</p>

<p>Moscow (Kuito Telegram): The Kwantung Army Command announced that Mongolian troops invaded Manchuria on the 24th and attacked Manchurian troops near Ulangonduuk. Informed sources in Kulun indicated that the Kwantung Army's report was a complete fabrication intended to deceive Japanese and world public opinion. No Mongolian soldiers invaded Manchuria on or before December 24th. On the 24th, a Manchukuoan army unit in two military vehicles invaded the Mongolian People's Republic's territory and attacked a Mongolian garrison near Bulundersen. Mongolian guards returned fire, forcing the Manchukuoan trucks to retreat. (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo (Japanese Source): Since the breakdown of the Manzhouli conference, the Manchurian-Mongolian border has become increasingly tense. Outer Mongolian leaders have reportedly arrived in Moscow to confer with Soviet leaders. The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that Soviet Red Army movements had been observed near the eastern shore of Lake Baikal, and over twenty aircraft regularly fly between Moscow and Babusk. Moreover, the Soviet Union has established a large enterprise company in Tianjin as a base for operations in the Far East, managed by former staff from the Chinese Eastern Railway. These reports are speculative, suggesting that the Soviet Union is adopting a more assertive policy in the Far East. (Hualian Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The "Krasnaya Gazeta" of Leningrad recently published an article expressing concern over Germany's recent "activities within Estonia" and the "scheming of the Nazi Party." It stated that many "so-called German geologists" have gone to areas of Estonia bordering the Soviet Union, ostensibly to search for oil but in reality engaged in some other activity, causing alarm. Furthermore, German Defense Minister General Blomberg and several German warships recently visited Estonia. More recently, several German military experts traveled to the Baltic islands of Dagö and Ösel to conduct surveys in preparation for constructing German naval bases in the Baltic Sea. The newspaper also stated that parts of Estonia's economy, especially its munitions industry, have already been taken over by German capital. The newspaper concluded: "Germany wants to place the Baltic coastal countries under its protection, to make them a 'second Manchuria.' What is its purpose?" (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Japanese Minister to Canada Kato and Canadian Prime Minister King successfully concluded trade negotiations. Notes on restoring trade to its original state were exchanged in Ottawa on the 27th. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the contents of the notes at 5:00 PM on the 28th, along with a statement expressing great satisfaction at the successful resolution of the Japan-Canada trade negotiations that had been ongoing since March of this year. Canada had used oppressive measures against Japanese goods, and Japan retaliated by applying the Trade Protection Act in July of this year, resulting in an unfortunate state of trade relations between the two countries. However, as a result of friendly negotiations between the two countries, it was decided to place Japan-Canada trade on an equal footing. From January 1st of next year, trade between the two countries will fully return to its original state. (Nippon Dempo, 28th)</p>
<p>Ottawa: The commercial dispute between Canada and Japan, which began in July of this year, is now coming to an end.

<p>Ottawa: The notes exchanged between Canada and Japan have now been published. According to these, Canada will, from January 1st, remove the ad valorem surtax of 33 1/3 percent on imports of Japanese goods.

<h3 id="e30">British Banking Group Movement: To Prevent Silver Prices from Falling; Plans to Form an Association to Absorb Forward Silver <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, major British banking groups plan to form an association to temporarily absorb forward silver being sold on the market in order to prevent silver prices from falling. If this organization is established, silver prices are expected to remain stable before the US Treasury buys silver from silver-producing countries and India to technically improve the silver market situation. Since the US silver policy changed course, the silver market has fallen sharply for several days. Yesterday's initial rebound was due to the stimulation of the above news. (Havas)</p>
<p>London: Recently, a proposal has been put forward to exchange gold for silver produced by silver-producing countries, so that these countries can establish a gold-silver bimetallic currency system. Banking circles here are very interested in this proposal, believing that since the United States and Mexico have already begun to implement it, it can be applied to the two countries in Central America. Although China is not a silver-producing country, it has approximately 800,000,000 ounces of silver in storage. If this were exchanged for US dollars, it could allow China to reform its currency system according to the current US method, and thereby assist the Chinese government in its recently implemented new monetary policy. This new monetary policy uses banknotes as legal tender and silver coins held by the Reserve Fund Committee as reserves. In the future, gold and silver coins can be used as reserves. In this way, China's currency system can approach that of Western countries that have abandoned the gold standard, making it easier for other countries to participate in China's economic and financial reconstruction. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>London: According to banking circles here, the plan by a British banking group to temporarily absorb forward silver being sold on the market to prevent silver prices from falling is actually related to the Chinese government's current negotiations regarding an international loan. It is generally believed that these negotiations are unlikely to be completed within a few months, or may have to wait until the majority of forward silver absorbed by the banking group has reached the delivery date before being finalized. At that time, since the banking group has gradually absorbed the forward silver sold by the Chinese side, it can exchange silver for gold, and the Chinese government will more easily obtain a gold loan. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>New York: Banking silver merchants do not believe the claim that the Treasury Department is suppressing silver prices to stop the smuggling of silver out of China. Most merchants believe that after silver prices fall, silver will inevitably concentrate, which is the case in any market. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Capital of Uruguay: Uruguay today broke off diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia and ordered the Soviet Minister, Minkin, and all embassy staff to leave the country.

<p>London: Prime Minister Baldwin recently published a New Year's message to the nation, stating, "The volume of British foreign trade has now increased compared to before. Although progress has been slow, it has been steady and reliable. The number of unemployed has also gradually decreased. All of this is enough to make people believe that Britain has crossed from the depressed scene of past years to the shore of revival. There should be even greater progress in the coming year. Since coming to power, the National Government has achieved much, and has recently won the general election. This shows that the majority of the public still has unwavering faith in the government. Although we want to fully achieve the goals of peace and prosperity, there are still many difficulties ahead that must be overcome. The policies that the government has implemented in the past have already revitalized trade and established a sound foundation for finance. Now that we have gained the trust of the electorate, we will naturally continue in the same way to achieve complete success." (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>

It is reported that this army has driven away the Italian forces in Danbian on the road to Magale. At the same time, according to unofficial sources, the Ethiopian army's offensive to clear Tigray Province is almost complete and will be carried out by means of day and night raids. Seven sacred arks are being guarded by senior priests and will be moved from the northwest. The Ethiopian army commander is said to have admitted that the operation may suffer significant losses, but they are willing to take this risk. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: A communiqué was issued here today stating, "Amidst the artillery fire and machine-gun fire of Giudada and the aerial bombardment, the Ethiopian army launched a surprise attack on the Italian army and recovered the city of Addeia in the Danbian district. The Italian army suffered heavy casualties and fled. The Ethiopian army captured over a hundred enemy soldiers and left twenty Italian officers' corpses on the battlefield, as well as many corpses of native non-commissioned officers. This operation is clearly part of the Ethiopian army's concerted attack to force the Italian army to withdraw from a large part of Tigray Province.

After several days of fierce fighting, the Italian army moved flexibly and immediately changed to an encirclement formation, eventually recovering the lost positions one by one. Ethiopian casualties in this operation numbered no less than several thousand. Italian soldiers and native troops also suffered many casualties. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Paris – Premier Laval engaged in a heated debate in the Chamber of Deputies this morning, defending his political life. Deputies from various parties held differing views on Laval's foreign policy. However, Laval remained calm. After a period of debate, the Chamber adjourned until 3:00 PM this afternoon, at which time Laval will deliver his final defense speech. At 6:00 PM, the Chamber will vote on the confidence issue concerning his foreign policy. Well-informed sources believe that everything hinges on Laval's ability to convince a small number of undecided deputies to salvage the situation. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – The atmosphere in the Chamber of Deputies was quite tense during Premier Laval's speech today. Socialist leader Blum then spoke, strongly criticizing Laval. Right-wing deputies interrupted him, infuriating the socialist deputies, who stood up and swung punches at those interrupting. The session was temporarily suspended. After a brief rest, Blum resumed his speech, stating that if all nations firmly supported the League of Nations, there would be no danger of war. Laval, however, was deliberately creating an atmosphere of impending war, and therefore should be asked to resign. Left-wing deputies applauded enthusiastically. Central party deputy Reynaud praised England and criticized Laval's policy, saying that Italy was an aggressor nation, while England was a supporter of the League of Nations covenant. France must choose between the two. About two-thirds of the deputies, from the extreme left to the central right, cheered upon hearing this warning. Observers called this the death knell for the current government. Others predicted that even if the Laval government won, it would only be by a margin of 20 to 30 votes. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Chamber of Deputies reconvened at 9:00 AM this morning for the foreign policy debate, with only ten deputies and one cabinet member in attendance. Premier Laval arrived quite early, looking very tired, having stayed up all night preparing his speech. Judging by appearances, the government's position is very precarious. However, many radicals are still hesitant, unwilling to overthrow the Laval government before the budget is passed, thus potentially triggering a serious political crisis. Laval's biggest political opponent, Mr. Caillaux, has decided not to attack Laval today. Meanwhile, the opposition has introduced a motion stating that the government has failed to create a clear impression that the world trusts the policies France has followed since 1919, which is regrettable. It also stated that the inseparability of national security and the League of Nations covenant should be the primary consideration. Central party deputy Champetier de Ribes introduced a vote of confidence in the government, stating that the government must respect the covenant while seeking peace. All speakers at this morning's meeting were brief, after which the session adjourned until 3:00 PM this afternoon. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Chamber of Deputies continued discussing the government's foreign policy this morning for three hours, until 12:05 PM, when it adjourned. Deputies delivered brief speeches, either defending or opposing the government. Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot also presented a motion stating that since 1919, the foundation of French foreign policy has been respect for the League of Nations covenant and national security. The government's attitude toward the Italo-Ethiopian dispute has failed to create this impression on the world, which is regrettable. The Chamber is scheduled to reconvene at 3:10 PM this afternoon and is expected to vote around 4:00 PM. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris – Seventy-three deputies are expected to speak on current affairs. The confidence vote on Laval's policy will be held at 4:00 PM on Saturday afternoon. Socialist leader Blum continued to criticize Laval, accusing him of failing to notify Italian Prime Minister Mussolini earlier of France's opposition to Italy's ambition to conquer Ethiopia. He called Laval the culprit for weakening the forces of peace. Blum fainted at this point due to over-excitement, but quickly regained consciousness and continued his speech. The Radical Socialist Party will be split over the confidence issue, which may give Laval an additional 30 to 40 votes. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris – In the Chamber of Deputies' lounge, it is generally predicted that the government will win the afternoon vote by a majority of about twenty votes.

<p>Paris – At 3:00 PM today, Premier and Foreign Minister Laval attended the Chamber of Deputies and delivered an important speech regarding the international situation since the resignation of former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and the failure of the plan proposed by England and France. He stated: "The Italian government did not study the plan proposed by England and France with enthusiasm and understanding, which was contrary to our expectations. Furthermore, Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in the new village of Pontinia did not facilitate our efforts to mediate the dispute. Although our efforts have been thwarted, I do not regret it, because peace will eventually be restored. Today's debate in the Chamber of Deputies, I believe, has three main questions: 1. Does the policy I have pursued conform to the interests of France? 2. Have I abandoned France's commitment to the League of Nations? 3. Has the security of France, both present and future, been harmed by me?" We should seek clarity on these three points. Laval then explained that France had accepted the sanctions and was strictly implementing them, stating, "I have declared to England that if it is attacked by Italy for implementing sanctions, France will provide assistance by sea, land, and air. I do not hesitate to offer this guarantee from France, knowing that I have assumed a great responsibility, which is unavoidable as a result of the League of Nations covenant. My duty is to ease relations between England and Italy in every way possible, because I believe that the more stringent our obligations under the League of Nations covenant, the more we should seek a peaceful resolution in every way possible." Laval then cited a statement by former British Foreign Secretary Hoare in the House of Commons, saying that Italy considers the oil embargo to be a military sanction, which is tantamount to war against Italy. Laval then praised Hoare as a man and said, "The plan proposed by England and France has indeed been abandoned, but the path to reconciliation remains open. The sanctions adopted by various countries in the economic and financial fields are already very severe. Who dares say that they are ineffective? If we expand the scope of sanctions, who dares guarantee that the scope of the conflict will not expand?" Laval then responded to some who accused him of abandoning international law, saying, "The purpose of international law is to prevent the outbreak of war in advance and to limit its impact afterward, not to expand the war and make it spread. The purpose of sanctions is to restore peace, but sanctions themselves are not an end, but only a means to an end. If the goal can be achieved more easily through negotiations, then negotiations are not only permitted by the League of Nations covenant, but also our duty, which the League of Nations should always remember." Laval then responded to some who accused the French government's attitude toward the Italo-Ethiopian dispute of reducing the chances of other countries helping France if it were attacked, saying that cooperation between England and France has always been the cornerstone of European security. "The unity of England and France has not been harmed because of me alone. I have no complaints that England ultimately rejected the plan that had already been drafted. In short, I do not regret what I have done in the past, and in the future, no matter what, I will continue to work tirelessly for peace." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Leaders of Left-Wing Parties; Eloquent and Passionate Speeches; Refuting Laval's Misleading the Country <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Paris – At 3:00 PM today, the Chamber of Deputies discussed the government's foreign policy. Premier and Foreign Minister Laval first delivered a lengthy speech, explaining the international situation after the resignation of former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and defending the government's current foreign policy. Orthodox leader Léon Blum then spoke, refuting Laval's policy with passionate words, saying that its aim was to please Italy and show disloyalty to the League of Nations covenant. As a result, France's allies, including the small countries of Central Europe, have been disheartened. He concluded that the best way to ensure France's security was to obtain the full assistance of England and Russia. Next, Mr. Taittinger, leader of the right-wing "Patriotic Youth League," spoke, saying that during the European War, England and Italy cooperated with France, the value of which is worth remembering. Therefore, the current cabinet should remain strictly neutral on the Italo-Ethiopian issue, without taking sides. If military sanctions are to be taken against Italy in the future, a mobilization order should be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for approval, then he and his comrades will not bear the responsibility for the vote. After Taittinger finished speaking, Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot spoke, saying that Laval's policy, while claiming to uphold the League of Nations covenant, was too weak and, on the other hand, was enough to encourage and reward Italy's determination to resist sanctions and Germany's attempt to take advantage of the situation. Herriot concluded by saying that because the government adopted this policy, the Radical Socialist Party caucus could not express confidence in the current cabinet. After he finished speaking, most of the Radical Socialist Party deputies applauded and cheered in unison. Judging from the attitude of the Radical Socialist Party deputies, the trend of the party's vote on the confidence issue can be roughly seen. At this point, Mr. Renault, chairman of the Central Republican Party caucus and former Minister of Finance, spoke, saying that Germany's main goal was to alienate the relationship between England and France. It is paying close attention to the development of the current international crisis. Therefore, it is not in France's interest to allow the bonds between England and France to loosen. As for the League of Nations covenant, even if Franco-Italian friendship is deep, it should still be faithfully fulfilled and should not be wavering. By this time it was 10:00 PM, and the Chamber of Deputies adjourned and continued the discussion tomorrow morning. The government's vote of confidence is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. Looking at the speeches of the deputies today, the most outstanding was Renault's. Although Renault belongs to the central faction, even opposition deputies cheered during his eloquent speech. What he said may affect the outcome of the vote of confidence tomorrow afternoon. Laval hopes to gain a majority of about twenty-five votes at that time. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris – In the Chamber of Deputies' debate on foreign policy this afternoon, the speech by Mr. Renault, chairman of the Central Republican Party caucus and former Minister of Finance, was the most outstanding. It won applause from the central and extreme left-wing deputies. The main points have been covered in previous telegrams, and the main points of the speech are supplemented below:</p>
<p>Renault said, "Since the Great War, we have repeatedly questioned England about the issue of automatically enacting sanctions under the League of Nations covenant. Only now have the English people answered directly, yes. This is a good opportunity, but we have failed to understand it." Renault then gave examples to explain the errors in the French public opinion's judgment of England's attitude. He also said that even if Abyssinia is conquered by the Italian army, Italy's population problem cannot be solved. "For example, in Italian Eritrea, there are currently 400,000 natives, but only 4,000 European expatriates. Even if 100,000 Italians can live and reproduce in Abyssinia in the future, Italy's population problem will still not be solved." If Italy had previously adopted a peaceful invasion method toward Abyssinia, the League of Nations would not have blocked Italy's path. "We cherish the Italian people deeply, and therefore we regret their misguided path greatly." Renault continued that since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has rejected peaceful proposals four times. The reason for this is not for material interests, but because the principles on which the League of Nations is based conflict with Fascism. Fascism has clearly declared that men dying on the battlefield is a matter of course, just like women should devote themselves to motherhood. Renault concluded by saying that France has the great British Empire on one hand and Italy, which is going against the League of Nations, on the other. Which should we follow? Will we bury the great hopes that arose after the European War, or will we bet on this move? (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Bombers Change Direction of Volcanic Lava</p>
<p>Hilo – Modern science is battling nature today. A squadron of American bombers has dropped bombs on Mauna Loa volcano in an attempt to change the direction of the lava flow. One aircraft dropped six 100-pound bombs on the lava flowing down the mountainside. Other aircraft flew to the top of the volcano and dropped bombs into the crater, aiming to block its exit and divert the lava to another direction. Whether this experiment will be effective is still unknown. The volcano had been dormant for two years and erupted again last month. Its lava has now flowed to within four miles of Hilo's water reservoir. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

This is because each bag arriving in Xiamen is 10 to 15 cents more expensive than from other places. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Exchanging Opinions with Doihara</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Political Council Postpones One Meeting, Beiping Communication: Since the establishment of the government committee, the Hebei-Chahar situation and the administrative organization have been completely renewed, and internal problems have been almost nonexistent. However, after the establishment of the council, the most pressing task is not personnel arrangements, but how to deal with foreign affairs, in order to strengthen the people's belief in the responsible authorities of the council. During the gestation period of the new political system in Hebei-Chahar, Xiao Zhenying, who was responsible for foreign affairs, declared to the press on November 18 that if the new political system is realized, the Tanggu Agreement can be abolished and the administrative powers of Hebei Province will be completely restored. The Japanese side had promised to return Dolun, which had been occupied. Song Zheyuan, the Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, who was stationed in Beiping, also stated that he would definitely achieve the above two points. These were all clearly stated. However, in reality, as of now, Dolun has not been recovered. Bordering the area, Guyuan, Changbao, Kangbao, Shangdu, Huade, and Zhangbei six counties, the Japanese side, under the pretext of wanting to complete its Manchu-Mongolian policy, actually had the puppet army of Li Shouxin invade under the cover of airplanes and artillery. As of now, the situation in these six counties is unknown because the intelligence from Zhangjiakou has not mentioned it, which is deeply concerning to the people of the country. Given that the situation is such, the issue of recovering Dolun is indeed one of the urgent concerns of the authorities. Secondly, there is the "Eastern Hebei" issue. Since its establishment on November 25, the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei has been in existence for exactly one month as of this month's 25th. Under the direction of the Japanese, Yin Rugeng issued another declaration, renaming it the "Autonomous Government." This move is ominous and seems to be a challenge to the Hebei-Chahar authorities. On the very day of the council's establishment, Chairman Song Zheyuan sent Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun to visit Doihara Kenji to propose negotiations for the cancellation of the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side went a step further, elevating the puppet organization by one step, declaring a name change, and expanding its area.</p>
<p>On the very day when the above news came out, Song Zheyuan, the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, because his Chief of Staff Chen Juesheng was temporarily acting as the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, went to Tianjin with Chen at 3:05 pm on the 25th. Many people accompanied him. Until now, Song and his cadres are all in Tianjin, and Beiping is unusually empty. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council's regular meeting on the 27th was announced to be postponed once because most of the committee members were not in Beiping. Song's confidant Lei Sishang was also summoned to Tianjin on the evening of the 27th to participate in confidential matters. According to political circles, Song Zheyuan and others will stay in Tianjin for three or four days before returning. There is indeed contact with the Japanese side in Tianjin, but it can only be said that they are exchanging opinions, and there is still a considerable distance from formal negotiations. Judging from the contact in the past two days, it is of course considered necessary to discuss the expansion of the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization first. As a result, after a hasty conversation with Doihara on the evening of the 25th in Tianjin, Doihara flew to Shenyang the next morning and then went to Changchun. After Doihara left Tianjin, there was a certain rumor here that the authorities of a certain city also flew there by Japanese plane, but it has yet to be confirmed. General observations suggest that there is considerable possibility. At the same time, there is also widespread speculation that the key to resolving the "Eastern Hebei" issue has been moved from Tianjin to Changchun. The reason is that Doihara's trip to the east this time, in addition to reporting on his stay in Beiping, will definitely request instructions on the issues of "Eastern Hebei," "Northern Chahar," and "Tanggu." It is expected that the leaders of the Kwantung Army will have an important agreement on the 27th and 28th, which will be brought back by Doihara for implementation. Therefore, it is understood that it will be difficult for our side to deal with these three matters. However, if the Hebei-Chahar Political Council cannot properly handle the current diplomacy, the internal and external impact will be incalculable. We are here only hoping that Song and Xiao will not break their previous words and will show great faith. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Japanese Troops Gradually Withdraw from Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Garrison Troops in Yu, Qin, Return to Original Defense</p>
<p>Abandoned Aircraft Field in Juzi, East of Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The issue of the Japanese military forcibly occupying land in Juzi, east of Tianjin, to build an airfield has been handed over to the Tianjin Office of the Provincial Government for negotiations after the changes in the political situation in Hebei Province, hoping to resolve it locally. As the office is being closed down, the negotiations have stalled. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government to instruct the Tianjin-Dagu Security Command and the Tianjin County Government to carefully monitor the construction situation. Currently, the Tianjin-Dagu Security Command has also been suspended, and all monitoring responsibilities have been transferred to the Tianjin County Government. According to the county government's report to the province after investigation, the more than 100 Japanese Kwantung Army Air Force personnel stationed in the International Racecourse in Dongjuzi left Tianjin on the 20th and returned to outside the pass. On the 22nd, personnel from the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters went to the airfield to remove the aircraft landing markers and the Japanese flag, and the electrical wires and military telephones stored in the racecourse's large dining hall were also taken away. From the 19th to the 24th, all Japanese planes flying in from outside the pass landed at the Bali Tai Airfield in Nankai, Tianjin, and the Dongjuzi airfield was not used. When the situation in North China was urgent, the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters had announced that six air squadrons, a total of 60 aircraft, would come to Tianjin to participate in a large-scale joint air and land military exercise between Beiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu. Now that this matter has passed and there is no need for further exercises given the current situation, the large air squadrons have ceased to fly in. However, the Japanese military headquarters has not yet indicated whether it will use the airfield for its own convenience or return it after two months. According to the county government's investigation, the airfield occupies 13.4 hectares of land, with 5 hectares owned by the Beining Railway Bureau, 8 hectares owned by Li Chun (former Military Governor of Jiangsu), and 40 acres owned by six farmers, including Wang Deming. The total area of the airfield is approximately 1,500 square meters, 1,200 meters wide from east to west, with 880 meters leveled, and 760 meters long from north to south, with 130 meters leveled. Half of the occupied land is cultivated farmland. Although the Tianjin Japanese military had previously stated that it would pay rent per acre, our side considered it a forced occupation because the negotiations were not concluded and did not accept their proposal.</p>
<p>As for all the Japanese garrison troops in North China, which were deployed from Yu, Qin, Tang, Luan, Chang, and Tang areas to the cities of Beiping and Tianjin during the previous tense situation, and the Matsui and Suzuki brigades of the Kwantung Army, which were gathering from Jinzhou and Suiyuan areas to Shanhaiguan, are now returning to their original garrisons outside the pass from the 20th onward, given the stabilization of the situation and the lack of need to station heavy troops. A portion of the troops is being transferred to eastern Chahar, stationed in Fengning, awaiting orders in the direction of Chahar. The Japanese garrison troops originally stationed in Yu, Qin, Luan, and Tang areas have been returning to their original garrisons from Beiping and Tianjin in two batches since the 21st. Regarding the replenishment of the Japanese garrison troops in North China, there is no confirmed news on how many new troops will be added and when they will arrive, as the budget has not yet been approved.

<p>Northeastern Middle School Students All on Hunger Strike</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: The student movement in Beiping has recently eased, but it has not become passive. On the 27th, the Student Union held a grand consolation meeting at the Yixian Hall of China University, firstly to console the students who were arrested and injured in the two petitions, and secondly to thank Chinese and foreign journalists and teachers and staff of various schools.

The presidium consisted of three members, organized by Yanjing University, China University, and Peking University. There were more than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists. The students' attitude, amidst enthusiasm, contained a feeling of sadness. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Security</p>
<p>On both sides of the gate of China University, there were picket teams organized by male and female students, holding wooden sticks used by Boy Scouts and rifles prepared for military training. All guests and students entering the school had to present their admission tickets or business cards, or they would be refused entry. After being permitted by the picket team, another traffic team led them to the entrance of the Yixian Hall. At the second door of the Yixian Hall, there was a registration desk. After completing the registration procedure, after a few more steps, you were inside the Yixian Hall. At the hall door, there were patrol teams responsible for collecting admission tickets and guiding seating arrangements. The arrangement of the venue was very thorough.</p>
<p>Display of Blood-Stained Clothing</p>
<p>The Yixian Hall faces south from the north, so the podium was built on the west side, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the Party and national flags hanging high. The opening ceremony was simple and hung at the top of the blackboard. The press box and the presidium were on the right side, and the injured students' rest area was on the left, with three soft beds, covered with luxurious Western pillows and bed sheets. Looking to the east, there was a yellow paper slogan hanging horizontally on the wall, "Blood-Soaked Ironclad Facts," below were thirteen pieces of blood-stained clothing of the injured students. On the right end were photos of the two petitions, totaling more than fifty photos, combined into five large panels. On the front table, there were more than one hundred consolation items, such as pastries, canned goods, fresh flowers, and fresh fruits. There were also more than a dozen commemorative mirrors made by the Student Union and presented to various schools, with the words "The Blood of Warriors, The Glory of Revolution" written on them. There were two larger mirrors, one inscribed with "Struggle" and the other with "Sacrifice," made and presented by the female students of No. 1 Girls' Middle School. The Jinghu Middle School also presented a banner inscribed with the four characters "National Fighters." At a glance, it was colorful and dazzling. The rest of the room was surrounded by slogans and colorful flowers.</p>
<p>China University's Consolation</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the consolation meeting as members, the students of China University, out of the courtesy of the host, organized a China University consolation team, specially made delicate flowers with pink silk ribbons.

<p>Conference Situation</p>
<p>After the announcement of the opening of the meeting, everyone stood at attention and bowed to the arrested and injured students (three minutes of silence). Then, the chairman, a representative from Yenching University, reported on the significance of the consolation meeting in two points: 1. To take the opportunity of consoling the arrested and injured students to gather students from all over the city in one hall, report on past facts and experiences, review past mistakes, and plan future work. 2. To reward the press who provided public opinion assistance and the teachers and staff of various schools who gave well-intentioned advice during the student movement. At the same time, it is hoped that all guests will gain a deep understanding and guidance on the past and future of the student movement in Beiping at this grand consolation meeting.</p>
<p>Student Union Report</p>
<p>Then, the Student Union representative (Peking University student) reported on the work of the Student Union, stating, "The Beiping Student Union was born in response to the environment of the times. Since its organization, it has been very secretive due to environmental factors, so it is unknown to the outside world. Now, I will briefly report to you on the general situation. This union was established on November 18, when only Yiwu Middle School and Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School and other schools initiated it. Eight schools participated, with three representatives from each school. The first representative conference was held on the 18th. Then, after active preparations, the second representative conference was held at the end of November, with 17 schools participating, and it was decided to hold a petition on December 9. On the evening of the 8th, the third representative conference was held to prepare for the parade on the 9th. The fourth representative conference was held on the 18th, with 52 schools participating. The meeting lasted the longest, from 3:00 PM on the 18th to 8:00 AM the next morning. All motions were divided into four parts: 1. Determining future directions. 2. Formulating a work program. 3. Centralizing command power. 4. Consoling injured and arrested students."</p>
<p>Guest Speeches</p>
<p>After the speeches by Liu Yaohan, the representative of the arrested students, and Tong Zhizhong, the representative of the injured students, the Tianjin Student Union representative reported on the recent situation of the Tianjin Student Union's work to save the country, stating that 22 schools participated in the Tianjin student movement, with more than 7,000 students. The parade and petition on December 18 were not obstructed by the military police. The purpose of this trip to Beiping is to not only express condolences but also to connect with the Beiping Student Union and take consistent actions. Then, Yang Wenkui, the representative of the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of National Colleges and Universities in Beiping and Tianjin, gave a speech expressing three points: 1. The student patriotic movement must have a perfect organization. 2. It is hoped that the spirit will be maintained forever. 3. The attitude must be calm. Then, students from various schools gave free speeches, shouted slogans, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>National Northeastern Zhongshan Middle School: All two hundred students have been on a hunger strike since the 27th. Representatives from various schools went to try to persuade them to eat, but the students of Zhongshan Middle School, because the Northeast has already fallen, reside in Beiping, and are often in danger of the Hebei problem, have no intention of eating. They wish to dedicate themselves to the country and recover the lost territory. Representatives from various schools are scheduled to make a second attempt to persuade them to eat on the 28th. According to people familiar with the situation of Northeastern Zhongshan Middle School, there are two reasons for the students' hunger strike: 1. The student movement in Beiping has recently declined. In order to encourage the patriotic sentiments of students, they are on a hunger strike to urge students from various schools to actively work to save the country. 2. The school's food expenses have long been allocated to the student union as office expenses. Now they only want to work and not eat, indicating that patriotism is more important than eating.

Based on the situation, pedestrian checks and household registration spot checks may be implemented. During the martial law period, transportation vehicles and vessels within the garrison area will be controlled by the police department. A meeting of various transportation organizations is scheduled for the 28th to discuss appropriate measures to adapt to the environment without hindering traffic. (27th)</p>

The following are two excerpts of the telegrams sent:</p>
<p>"Nanjing Central Executive Committee, National Government Chairman Lin, Executive Yuan President Jiang Junjian, Yin Ni Rugeng, under the guise of autonomy, has seized Ji-Dong and betrayed the country. All nationals are outraged by this kind of outrageous behavior. Our central government has the responsibility to maintain territorial and administrative integrity. We urgently request a clear order to suppress and stop the chaos. Faculty and students, etc., will spare no sacrifice to be the backing of our government. Military and political officials in Beiping, as national leaders, have a duty to defend the country. Recently, they have used force to suppress the patriotic movement of students, resulting in heavy casualties. At this critical moment of national survival, they are suppressing popular sentiment, not knowing what their intentions are. We also earnestly request the central government to quickly protect the legitimate actions of students who love the country, and console the injured students to respect public opinion and strengthen the foundation of the country. Urgent request, please consider. Wuhu Secondary School Faculty and Student National Salvation Movement Federation."</p>
<p>"Beiping Peking University to all students in Beiping schools, Junjian, At this critical moment of national survival, our students are carrying out a vigorous patriotic movement in a dangerous city with conspiracies lurking everywhere. After admiration, we are willing to fight together. We have heard that you have been subjected to violent suppression and suffered extremely serious injuries. The tragic and glorious sacrifice is enough to show that the hearts of our people are not dead. We hereby send our condolences and hope that you will continue to make persistent efforts to save the country from danger. Wuhu Secondary School Faculty and Student National Salvation Movement Federation." (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Qingdao Academic Community's Appeal for National Salvation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>—Separate telegrams to the Ministry of Education and Song Zheyuan—</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence, Recently, students in Peiping and Tianjin have been conducting strikes out of deep patriotism as a national salvation movement, and students across the country have responded enthusiastically. The students of National Shandong University in Qingdao have also held meetings several times to discuss the establishment of a student national salvation committee as support for the students in Peiping and Tianjin. Mayor Shen Honglie, fearing that students did not understand the true facts and would cause misunderstandings, has summoned students from various secondary schools and above for talks to explain the true situation of the current situation and ordered them to focus on their studies and not to jeopardize their lives due to momentary impulsiveness. Therefore, students in other places are extremely active, but Qingdao is silent and unknown. However, teachers and students of Qingdao's large, medium, and small schools have also sent telegrams to the Ministry of Education and Song Zheyuan, which are copied as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>"Nanjing Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, and forwarded to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Junjian, Recently, there has been a brewing of autonomy and separation in Peiping and Tianjin, and students there, with deep patriotism, have petitioned together. Officials have failed to investigate and have indiscriminately arrested and attacked them. The academic community in Qingdao shares deep sorrow and indignation. Recently, our local officials have repeatedly stated to teachers and students throughout the city the central government's determination to stabilize North China and maintain territorial sovereignty, and have urged them to strictly abide by the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to study diligently. Although faculty and staff will carefully follow the teachings and adhere to the scope, we are still unable to restrain ourselves from speaking out. It is said that the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is a disguised form of the autonomous committee, which people get the substance of, and we take the name of it, which implies great worries for the future of North China. Judging by the past changes, it seems difficult to fully decide on our own. This is the first reason for public concern. It is also said that our country's diplomacy will take the facts as the premise, and the entire negotiation of the country as one thing, and the accomplished fact of North China as another thing, to deal with it in separate ways and endure and seek survival. If what is said is true, it is tantamount to withdrawing the fence ourselves. This is the second reason for public concern. Beiping is the cultural center of our country and the place where the national spirit lies. Now, when a great disaster is happening, there is no freedom to appeal. If the evolution becomes more intense in the future, what room will there be to study national affairs? The tragedy of the fox facing death and the rabbit crying is the same feeling for everyone. What will the country have without the national soul? This is the third reason for public concern. We think that the major plan of the country has already been calculated in the temple. Although we know that observing through a tube and measuring with a gourd cannot help the profound, we only use the meaning of everyone's responsibility to do our best to offer the wild man's sincerity. Urgent statement, not at all in fear and trembling, to await orders.</p>
<p>Telegram to Song Zheyuan</p>
<p>"Peiping Chairman Song Junjian, In recent years, the country has suffered many misfortunes and frequent disasters. You have led a partial division to protect the country, and your name will be recorded in history and shine like the sun and stars. Recently, when the Peiping-Tianjin incident occurred, various false statements emerged. Fortunately, you were able to overcome the difficulties. Now the central government is seeking talents for the country, and you have been entrusted with the key to the northern gate. You have also shown the people that you will uphold the government and safeguard national rights. Your vows are clear to all. Recently, student unrest has occurred frequently, shocking the country. People say that the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will be a disguised form of the autonomous council, existing in name only and on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the people love you and hope for you, or even doubt you. It is actually the meaning of Spring and Autumn criticizing the wise, not counting the excessive words. If what is said is not true, then the students will regret their rashness, and how can you allow it? If you are in a difficult situation and it is difficult to deal with, please rein in the horse on the edge of the cliff and quickly decide what to do. National rights are at stake, and there is no turning back. As a wise man, you must have planned it carefully. Moreover, there are many students in the capital's universities, and the national lifeline is at stake. Protection and guidance depend on the wise, and this is an immortal accomplishment. The people of the country should wait and see with vigilance. Sincere advice, please take note."</p>

<p>A Patrol Officer Resigns After a Robbery in His Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Wang Shougen's rice store, located at No. 10, Jia 12, Bao 4, Aimin Town, Section 1 of the county, was suddenly attacked by six bandits around 9:00 PM the night before. Four bandits entered the store, while two stood guard outside. The bandits robbed the store of gold jewelry, cash, and other items, resulting in a loss of 200 yuan. When the victim's aunt, Jiang, shouted for help, the bandits angrily slashed her forehead with an axe, causing profuse bleeding. Subsequently, the local security, water, and land public security organs searched everywhere for the bandits but were unable to apprehend them by dawn. The next day, County Magistrate Li learned of the incident and considered it a serious oversight in defense that a robbery had occurred in the center of the area, injuring the victim. He ordered that the case be solved and the stolen goods and bandits be apprehended within three days. Failure to comply would result in the dismissal and punishment of the patrol officer and the responsible watch post. An emergency meeting was also convened. It is reported that the Aimin Town winter defense watch post has ordered the town mayor to establish it within three days and has dispatched a security team to station at Luo Shen Temple to deter criminals. However, Huang Heqing, the patrol officer in charge, has taken responsibility for the incident and submitted his resignation to the bureau chief.</p>

<p>Farmers Petition for Rent Reduction Dispute</p>
<p>Farmers in Xietang Township, due to the severe crop disaster this year, were very dissatisfied with the color requirements for rent collection by the owners of various businesses. Therefore, they watched and waited to return the rent, resulting in a small number of collections by various businesses. They requested the Public Security Bureau to strictly pursue the field rent. The day before yesterday, more than 1,000 farmers petitioned the Xietang Township District Office, demanding rent reduction. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau specially dispatched two branch directors, Huang Tian, to Xietang and other townships to urge rent collection. On the 25th, more than 1,000 farmers petitioned the district office for the second time, demanding rent reduction. Branch Director Huang immediately advised the farmers to return the rent, but the farmers did not listen and were tough in their attitude. Huang immediately ordered two rows of warning shots to be fired and arrested four stubborn tenants, including Zhang Yunxiang. Later, after mediation by township heads and others, the farmers dispersed. The next day, township heads convened an emergency meeting and resolved: Township Baojia chiefs should work with the Public Security Bureau to persuade farmers to return the rent as soon as possible and not blindly follow others. This year's disaster is severe, please ask the county to order various businesses to specify colors and reduce the length by 10%. Tenants should pay rent with rice. Please ask the owners to send people to the countryside to collect rent. Please ask the county to set up agricultural warehouses to provide relief. The above resolution will be delivered by Branch Director Huang to County Magistrate Wu on the 27th, and County Magistrate Wu will convene various owners to discuss the plan.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Higher Court believes that the current system in various prisons, which treats juvenile and adult offenders equally, is not appropriate. The physiology and psychology of juveniles and adults, and the motives and circumstances of crimes, are very different. It is necessary to establish separate juvenile prisons to specifically detain juvenile offenders under the age of 20. Following an order from the Ministry, it is instructed to refer to the Shandong method and first establish them in the provincial capital and major commercial ports. Preparations have begun to establish one in Hangzhou and Ningbo each, and then gradually expand.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I have recently read the Hankou communication in your newspaper on December 22, which stated that students from Hanyang marched to demonstrate and gathered at the Senior Industry School, and only the Xunnv Middle School did not participate due to the school authorities' prohibition. Upon investigation, the students of our school participated in full that day, and the gathering place was in Hanyang Junior Middle School (formerly No. 12 Middle School). The so-called school authorities' prohibition is untrue. The facts are there and should be corrected. Sincerely, Private Hanyang Xunnv Middle School. December 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Education Broadcasting Special Edition - Mandarin Lectures - What to Write <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Ye Shaojun of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Fellow students, the subject of Chinese involves many things. I won't talk about too many things, just a little about writing, divided into two parts. Today's topic is "What to Write," and the next topic is "How to Write." My words may not be of direct help to you, that is, your writing ability may not necessarily increase much after listening to my words. My words may be of some indirect help to you, that is, after listening to my words, pay attention to what should be paid attention to, avoid what should be avoided at any time, work hard in aspects that should be worked hard, and don't waste your mind in aspects that don't need attention. After a considerable amount of time, your writing ability will naturally gradually increase.</p>
<p>"When you start writing now, it can probably be divided into the following aspects: The Chinese teacher assigns topics on a regular basis for you to practice, and you have to write. After listening to various courses, sometimes you need to take notes; after doing various experiments, sometimes you need to write reports, and you have to write. After traveling to a place, you want to record what you have seen and heard, as well as your own feelings. When you are away from your family and relatives, you want to tell them about your recent life, and you have to write. Sometimes, from various perceptions, a kind of artistic conception is condensed, and you only feel that you must transform this kind of artistic conception into concrete words, either in the form of poetry or in the form of a novel or story, and then you feel happy, so you also have to write.</p>
<p>The writing materials in the above aspects are all original in your life, not forcibly taken from outside your life. In other words, these writing materials are all your own experiences. When we usually speak, from the extremely simple "Have you eaten?" and "This book is very good" to the extremely complex comments on a matter and speculations on a matter, it is all based on our own experiences. Because it is based on our own experiences, we can speak logically, without a single superfluous word or a single nonsensical word. If we go beyond the scope of our experience and talk nonsense, such as talking about how the stars move without any knowledge of astronomy, or trying to predict the future of the Italian-Ethiopian War and Japanese negotiations without any knowledge of international politics and economics, we will definitely say things that don't make sense and only provide people with material for ridicule. If a person has self-knowledge, he will never do such a stupid thing, talking nonsense beyond the scope of his own experience. He must know how much experience he has, in what aspects he can speak, and in what aspects he is not qualified to speak. It is not embarrassing to not speak in occasions where you are not qualified to speak, but rather a virtue of acting according to your ability and keeping within your limits. The scope of experience is like a ripple, expanding more and more. When it expands to a considerable extent, you are qualified to speak when you were originally not qualified, then speak, and it is not too late. Writing is originally a continuation of speaking, so to remedy the poverty of speaking, we take up our pens to write in occasions where speaking cannot reach. Therefore, writing should naturally be the same as speaking, only taking things within the scope of experience as writing materials, and not forcibly dragging things outside the scope of experience to the tip of the pen. Judging from the several aspects of writing that you are doing now, all writing materials are your own experiences, which is a very smooth thing. May you always follow this tendency, this is a flat and wide road.</p>
<p>The meaning of the previous layer seems very ordinary, but it is actually very important. Why? Because the attitude towards writing is established from this. Knowing that writing is originally a continuation of speaking, and that writing materials should be limited to one's own experience, this regards writing as an extremely ordinary but extremely serious matter. Everyone wants to write, just like everyone wants to speak, isn't it extremely ordinary? You cannot go beyond your own experience, you cannot be reckless, isn't it extremely serious? This attitude is normal. For people who hold this attitude, writing is a useful skill. There is also another attitude, regarding writing as an extremely special but extremely casual thing. This can be understood more clearly from the situation in the former private schools. In the past, there were many students in private schools, perhaps a dozen or so, or as few as three or four. These students did not all write articles. Those who were going to study engineering or commerce would be done after studying for a few years. Only a few who were preparing to take the imperial examination would start writing articles at a certain time. Starting to write articles was called "opening the pen," which was a great event. Students who opened their pens had to give the teacher extra tuition, and parents would say to others, "My child has 'opened the pen,'" often with a proud smile on their faces. Why was this? Because writing articles could be used to take the imperial examination, and future success all stemmed from this, so everyone regarded it as an extremely special thing, and this special thing belonged to a minority of people. Furthermore, what did they write after opening the pen? It was either "On Revisiting the Old to Know the New" or "On Emperor Gaozu of Han." They would turn over and over and entangle for a while and then finish the article. They would casually grab an event of Emperor Gaozu of Han, praise him or scold him, and that would be an excellent masterpiece. Especially if they praised what everyone scolded and scolded what everyone praised, this was called "reversing the case," and they could get a lot of praise from the teacher. Most of these materials were not their own experiences, but merely imitating the tone of others and piling up some irrelevant meanings. To put it bluntly, it was simply parroting and playing with words. Developing from this path, there came articles that specialized in piecing together allusions and poems that groaned without illness. One's own experience was like this, but what was written was not like this, perhaps it was even the opposite. Writing was divorced from real life and only became something to decorate life. What was the value of having this writing skill? Therefore, it is said that this attitude is extremely casual. Now, although the imperial examination has been abolished and writing starts as early as the first grade of elementary school, people's attitudes towards writing have not completely gotten rid of the old malady. Now every student has to write, which is certainly not a special thing for a minority of people, but we often hear students say, "I have no ideas, no materials, I simply can't write anything when I pick up a pen," or "We have to write again today, it's really annoying!" These words express a misunderstanding, thinking that writing is a special thing in school life, and that you have to leave your own experience to think of ideas and find materials. It seems that your own original experience is not worthy of being used as ideas or materials. Furthermore, inferring from here, it seems that the so-called ideas and materials are a kind of flowery words that sound very good and look very beautiful, but have no connection with real life. These flowery words must be searched for with great effort, like hunting dogs searching for birds and beasts lurking in the mountains and forests. You may not be able to get what you search for, so there are times when you can't write anything when you pick up a pen. Accumulating the experience of not being able to write anything for several times, you feel that writing is really an annoying thing. In fact, even if you can write something every time you write with this kind of attitude, it is not something to be happy about. Because writing, like speaking, is definitely not just writing some flowery words that sound very good and look very beautiful on paper and finishing it. It must be based on your own experience and flow out of real life, and that is in line with the original intention of writing articles. Like this, leaving your own experience and deliberately searching, although the effort of searching may be very troublesome, we cannot but say that he takes writing too casually. The attitude of seeing it as special and seeing it as casual makes writing a skill that is useless to life, so it must be changed. You might as well think for yourself: Do you regard writing as a special thing in school life? Do you deliberately search for empty materials away from your own experience? If you haven't, then that's the best. If you really do, and it's still like this today, then please change it immediately, change it to a normal attitude, which is to regard writing as ordinary and serious. People who hold a normal attitude will never say that they have no ideas or materials, because they will never have no experience, and experience is their ideas and materials. He will also never say that writing is really annoying, because writing is an item in his life, just like speaking and eating are items in life. No one will ever say that speaking and eating are really annoying. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Since the disastrous fall in overseas silver prices, foreign banks, finding no profit, have restricted the buying and selling of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, in order to stabilize foreign exchange, have continued to buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions. As a result, the foreign exchange trading of these three banks has suddenly flourished. Fortunately, through strenuous efforts to stabilize it, the daily announced telegraphic transfer selling prices remain at standard levels, but the balancing tax rate, due to the continued decline in overseas silver prices, has also fallen accordingly. Yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced a balancing tax rate of 10.5 percent. The Central Bank announced telegraphic transfer selling prices of one shilling and two and a half pence for one national currency in London, US$29.75 for one hundred national currency in New York, 452 francs for one hundred national currency in Paris, 73.75 marks for one hundred national currency in Berlin, 103 yen for one hundred national currency in Japan, and 93 Hong Kong dollars for one hundred national currency in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Key Points of the Third Phase of the "Three-izations" Lifestyle <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association began to implement the "militarization, industrialization, and artification" plan for lifestyle this year, starting with civil servants in various government agencies, issuing key points in phases, from the simple to the complex, step by step. The first phase of key points has already been fully implemented and the results have been tallied and published. The second phase will also be fully implemented by the end of this month, pending assessment. Therefore, the third phase of key points will be implemented from January 1st next year. The Association has already issued a copy to each agency and official in the city, and the responsible leaders are responsible for supervising and urging compliance. The content of these key points is aimed at correcting bad habits and reversing the decline, so if everyone can put them into practice, it will benefit both public and private interests, and the social atmosphere will be greatly changed. The original text of the third phase of key points is recorded below: "Preliminary Plan for the Implementation of the Three-izations Lifestyle in Shanghai Agencies", Third Phase Key Points (To be implemented from January 1, 1936)</p>
<p>Principles</p>
<p>To cultivate swift and orderly action; to cultivate a life of labor and frugality; to cultivate habits of politeness and law-abiding. (A) Pertaining to Militarization: Hair should not be too long, should not be oiled, and should not be permed; in the office, be energetic in work, do not joke around, do not make noise, do not doze off; stipulate personal work and rest times, read useful books and newspapers in your spare time. (B) Pertaining to Industrialization: Vigorously practice frugality, tighten various public and private consumptions; do not borrow money from others unless absolutely necessary, and must return it immediately after borrowing, do not break your promise; live within your means, record all income and expenditure items one by one. (C) Pertaining to Artification: Do not easily quarrel, should be calm and peaceful; be helpful to others, do not only consider your own interests; do not flatter others, do not insult others, should respect your own and others' personality.</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>These key points are based on the implementation plan issued by the General Association, taking into account the actual situation in Shanghai. They are from the simple to the complex, implemented in phases. Civil servants in various agencies are role models for citizens, so they must first regard the three-izations lifestyle as a standard of conduct and strive to implement it. The heads of each agency are responsible for supervising and promoting the full responsibility of implementing these key points. When implementing these key points, the third phase of key points must continue to be diligently implemented without slackening. These key points are for a period of two months, and the New Life Movement Association may inspect them at any time during implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e116">National Salvation Movement of All Circles <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>To oppose the East Hebei puppet organization, all students of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology continued yesterday to set out for Nanxiang, Zhoupu, Xinzhuang, Baoshan, Pudong, Minhang, Songjiang, and other places to propagate to the masses. It is reported that they were divided into fifteen teams and departed at 8:00 AM. Students of the National Tongji University, in view of the increasingly serious national crisis, believe that student work should be stepped up. Therefore, they established a student self-government association a few days ago. In addition to handling internal self-government work, they are also committed to the national salvation movement. It is now reported that they have sent representatives to Beijing to petition, and also intend to propagate to the masses. The National Salvation Federation of Middle School Students, organized by students of various middle schools in this city, aims to promote the national patriotic spirit and assist the government in safeguarding the integrity of territorial sovereignty. It is learned that the Federation will hold a reception for reporters from various newspapers in this city at 2:00 PM this afternoon at the Municipal Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road in the South City to report on the significance of the Federation's organization.</p>
<p>The Dazhong Middle School National Salvation Association issued a declaration yesterday, stating briefly: Our country and nation, in a harsh environment, has continuously lost the rich territories of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, and now the North China demilitarized zone has been created, and they want to further autonomize North China. Therefore, traitors like Yin Rugeng have occupied East Hebei and declared independence, which is certainly a manifestation of conscience-stricken and willing to be attached to the enemy. At this critical moment of national death, the imminent demise of China has naturally triggered a widespread student movement across the country to carry out the work of saving the country and nation. We patriots do not want to lag behind, so we also organized a national salvation association to participate in this meaningful student movement to fulfill the responsibility of saving the nation from danger.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Natives from Wujiang telegraphed: To the Shen Bao and all compatriots across the country: Recently, we submitted a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: Since the North China Incident, all nationals have been grieved and indignant. Now, the members' congress has resolved to telegraph the government, urging the maintenance of the patriotic movement and the immediate punishment of traitors to redress the humiliation and save the country. All members of this association vow to be the government's backing, etc. Respectfully telegraphing this, we ask that everyone advocate together to save the country. The Shanghai Association of Natives from Wujiang respectfully salutes.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Land Bureau: Measures for Clearing Overflow Land, Increasing Taxes, etc. <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau's clearance of backlog cases and extension of office hours was reported in previous news. It is now learned that the Bureau has formulated measures for clearing the unsettled cases of overflow land and tax increases, as well as for clearing the cases of land with license and land applied for along the streets which have been completed but the prices have not been paid, and has submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgated them to the people of the city for general knowledge so that they can comply with the payment and issuance of certificates. The announcement and measures are explored and recorded below.</p>
<p>Public Announcement</p>
<p>It is hereby announced that since the Land Bureau conducted a survey of land in this city, many cases of overflow land have been discovered, which should be subject to tax increases and price payments according to regulations. It is currently estimated that after the Bureau notified the owners of this overflow land, there are still about 1,200 cases who have not come to the Bureau to pay the price. In addition, there are more than 100 cases of tax increases for land with permits and land applied for along the streets, which the Bureau has notified but have not yet been paid. These are all payments that the owners should make, but they have repeatedly delayed, resulting in long-standing arrears, making it difficult to clear and issue documents, and affecting the city's revenue. Among them, many owners have been waiting and seeing, and it is inevitable that some are unable to pay. Now, in order to show consideration for the owners and facilitate their raising of funds for payment, those who pay in full within three months will be given a discount on the originally determined amount to be paid. Once cleared, certificates will be issued within two weeks to show consideration. If they are really unable to pay the price in one lump sum, they will be allowed to pay in installments over the years, and interest will be charged appropriately to show fairness. The measures for clearing the unsettled cases of overflow land and tax increases, as well as the measures for clearing the cases of land with permits and land applied for along the streets which have been completed but the prices have not been paid, have been separately drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. The two types of measures mentioned above are hereby announced to the people of the city so that all landowners regarding cases where overflow land has been measured, as well as tax increases for land with permits and land applied for along the streets, which have been notified by the Bureau before October 18, 1935, must comply with the measures below and come to the Bureau to pay and obtain certificates, and do not err again. This is specially announced. December 28, 1935, Cai Zengji, concurrently acting Land Bureau Director. Attachment:</p>
<p>Clearance Measures</p>
<p>(A) Measures for Clearing the Unsettled Cases of Overflow Land and Tax Increases: All owners of overflow land and tax increases who pay the full amount within one month after this announcement and notification will have the originally determined amount reduced to 70 percent. Within two months, it will be reduced to 75 percent. Within three months, it will be reduced to 80 percent. After three months, the original amount to be paid will still be paid, and interest will be added from the date of the announcement. In the special zone, the monthly interest rate is 8 percent. In the urban commercial district, the monthly interest rate is 6 percent. In the non-urban commercial district, the monthly interest rate is 4 percent. If it is less than one month, it will be counted as one month. If half of the amount is paid first within three months after the announcement and notification, the remaining half will be allowed to be paid in installments over the years. The half paid first will be reduced to 75 percent within one month after the announcement, 80 percent within two months, and 85 percent within three months. The half to be paid in installments will still be calculated at the original amount in full. In the special zone, it will be allowed to be paid in three equal annual installments. In the urban commercial district, it will be allowed to be paid in five years. In the non-urban commercial district, it will be allowed to be paid in eight years, all without interest. If there is a transfer of ownership during the installment period, the full amount should be paid at once. Whether the full amount is paid in one lump sum or in installments, the business license will be issued within two weeks after the full amount is verified and collected. During the installment period, the full amount can be paid at any time to obtain the certificate. If there are buildings rented out or people renting land for construction on land containing overflow land, a minimum of installment payment according to Article 2 must be made within three months. If this is not complied with, effective measures will be taken to deal with it. These clearance measures will be promulgated and implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. (B) Measures for Clearing the Cases of Land with Permits and Land Applied for Along the Streets which have been Completed but the Prices have not been Paid: All owners of land with permits and land applied for along the streets who have not yet complied with the notification to pay the price will be handled in accordance with the following provisions after this announcement and notification: A. Those who pay the full amount within one month will have it reduced to 80 percent (calculated according to the amount payable in the first notification, the same below). B. Those who pay in full within two months will have it reduced to 85 percent. C. Those who pay half the amount within one month and pay the full amount within two months will have the first half reduced to 80 percent and the second half reduced to 85 percent. Those who pay in full within three months will have the second half reduced to 90 percent. Those who pay in full within four months will have the second half reduced to 95 percent. D. Those who pay half the amount within two months will have the first half reduced to 85 percent and the second half reduced to 90 percent. Those who pay in full within four months will have half the amount reduced to 95 percent. Land with permits in the four districts of the French Concession, including Gaohang, Luhang, Yangjingtang, and Qiaotang, where the full price is paid, will be further reduced by 10 percent based on the previously determined reduction rates. Those who pay the full amount in one lump sum will be issued a business certificate two weeks later. Those who pay the full amount in two installments will be issued a certificate within three days after the second installment is completed. If the price is not paid within two months or the first half of the price is paid and the second installment is overdue, it should be deemed as a waiver of rights, and the case will be canceled and dealt with according to the following regulations: A. The land with a permit will be released for application separately. After the release, the original price of the permit will be refunded. B. The land along the streets will be released separately. In all of the above cases, if the first installment has been paid, it will not be refunded.</p>
<h3 id="e120">County Government Levies the Second Installment of Land Tax <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government began levying the first installment of the land tax for 1935 on September 1, which has already expired. Therefore, it has continued to levy the second installment yesterday and has complied with the order to set the deadline as January 23, 1936. The autumn survey of this year was submitted to the Department of Finance for approval, and it was generally reduced by 10 percent. The second installment of the land tax license will deduct the corresponding amount to actually levy five-sixths. In addition to distributing the notification forms to various Bao-Tu treasuries for distribution, it also announces to the owners for general compliance and payment at the treasury on schedule to draw the certificate and settle the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Post Office Bureau: Improving Parcel Delivery from New Year's Day <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Waiver of Parcel Inspection Procedures at Various Ports Along the Yangtze River</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the public, the Ministry of Communications' Directorate General of Posts is improving parcel delivery, and the Shanghai Post Office Bureau has been ordered to implement it from New Year's Day next year. The details are explored below.</p>
<p>Improving Delivery</p>
<p>Since the Directorate General of Posts moved to Nanjing, it has been working harder to promote postal affairs. In areas where inland rail is not accessible, the original regulations stipulated 20 kilograms for parcels. In order to facilitate the public, the Bureau will change it to 30 kilograms from New Year's Day next year. However, those forwarded through foreign post will still be limited to 20 kilograms. The Bureau in this port has decided to implement it as scheduled. In addition, the Directorate General is actively planning for general postal awards and postal services in border areas.</p>
<p>Waiver of Parcel Inspection</p>
<p>After the Customs implemented the abolition of parcel transit tax last November, the Directorate General of Posts and the Inspector General of Customs negotiated this autumn to reduce and exempt parcel inspection procedures to facilitate postal delivery. The Directorate General of Posts has now ordered post offices in various places that, in addition to parcels received and sent by post offices at border and coastal trading ports, which may be randomly inspected by the Customs at any time, parcel inspections will be reduced and exempted at ports along the Yangtze River from now on, including Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yueyang, Changsha, Shashi, Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing, and other eleven places.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Central Bank yesterday, stating: We are writing to you because we have investigated the eight articles of the measures for unifying the exchange of legal tender in the Ministry of Finance's November telegram. Article 2 states that post offices entrusted by the designated banks may also serve as legal tender exchange agencies. There are no banks established in the Jiangwan district of this city, only the post office, but the post office refuses to accept exchanges because it has no orders from above, causing great inconvenience to merchants and the public. We hereby request that your bank consult with the Post Office Bureau to entrust the post offices in the towns and villages of this city where no bank branches are established to handle the exchange of legal tender so as to meet the fundamental purpose of facilitating the people. According to the report from the branch office of this association, the Jiangwan district is particularly in need, and we would like to ask for your immediate transfer to facilitate implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Grain Merchants Telegraph Southwest Authorities Again Urging the Abolition of Bran Surtax <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Unclogging Accumulated Goods to Relieve Merchant Hardship</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake, and other trade groups telegraphed the Southwest authorities again yesterday to appeal for the abolition of the bran surtax. The original telegram reads: Distributed to Principal Zou of Zhongshan University, Chairman Lin of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Commissioner's Office of Guangdong Finance: We have been requesting the abolition of the Guangdong Province's surcharge on domestic bran for the Zhongshan University construction fund for four months. Manufacturers and transporters from various places have repeatedly appealed, and during the Fifth National Congress, they jointly petitioned in Nanjing. The reply was that factories should resume work first, and the case would be submitted to the competent authorities of the National Government for correction, etc. At the same time, we met with Your Excellency (Principal Zou of Zhongshan University), who agreed to return to Guangdong to resolve the matter. Oil factories from various places resumed work on the 25th of last month, but more than a month has passed since then. The goods have accumulated, silver stocks are blocked, and we are struggling to maintain ourselves in great pain. Furthermore, it has been found that the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee passed a resolution on the Zhongshan University construction fund at the beginning of this month, indicating that the government has already raised funds separately for the Zhongshan University construction fund. There is no factual difficulty in abolishing the Guangdong Province's surcharge on domestic bran. It is learned that Your Excellency (Principal Zou) has already returned to Guangdong and will be able to abolish it immediately. In order to resolve the pain as soon as possible, the merchants have no choice but to telegraph again, appealing to Your Excellency (Committee) (Office) to approve the Merchants Political Committee to maintain the order of May last year that only soybean bran from the three northeastern provinces should not be subject to tax, and to issue a clear order to exempt or levy taxes on bran from the Northeast and domestic production before the end of December this year, so as to unclog the accumulated goods as soon as possible and relieve merchant hardship. The representatives of the Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake, Oil Press, Guangdong Native Grain, and Chaozhou Sugar and Grocery Trade Associations, Gu Xinyi, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Ordered to Investigate the Closure of Fuhua Silver Company <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Unauthorized Business Without Registration</p>
<p>The Deputy Manager Fled Without a Trace</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Fuhua Silver Company at No. 18 North Sichuan Road in this city, which opened on September 12 this year, closed down not long after its establishment under the deputy managers Wu Xiejie and Zeng Ziqi. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce was ordered yesterday by the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate whether there were any losses or frauds when the company closed down. The original order stated: It has been found that this Bureau previously received an instruction from the Municipal Government, based on a consultation from the Ministry of Finance, to report that the Fuhua Silver Company at No. 18 North Sichuan Road was carrying out unauthorized business without being registered, ordering us to investigate and ban it. The Bureau then ordered the company's deputy managers, Wu Xiejie and Hui Ziqi, to stop the business of Fuhua Silver Company and ordered them not to trade before the approval of the Ministry. It was then reported that after sending the order, the Fuhua Silver Company had already closed down, and the managers Wu Xiejie and others had fled without a trace, and the order could not be delivered. It is hereby ordered that the investigation be carried out quickly and reported to enable verification and transfer. After receiving the order, it is reported that the Association has sent personnel to investigate.</p>

<p>Submitting Opinions and Consulting Henan Provincial Government for Handling</p>
<p>Informing the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Approval Yesterday</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce approved yesterday the Ministry of Industry's letter No. 39985, which stated: Your telegram dated December 11, 1935, regarding the Xuchang County Chamber of Commerce's request to investigate and handle the case of Lang Dusheng's unauthorized use of foreign capital to establish a tobacco company, requested that we investigate and send someone to investigate thoroughly and promptly stop it. We have learned that the Henan Provincial Government consulted the Ministry on the case of Wu Tingsheng's establishment of a tobacco company and the collection of tobacco in Xuchang, and that Xu Yaping, the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District, listed various points, requesting clarification and explanation. We have reviewed it, formulated opinions, and consulted the Henan Provincial Government for handling. As for the request of Baoda Tobacco Company and others to cancel the registration of the Xuchang Tobacco Company, the request was previously submitted to the Ministry. The Department replied that the cancellation of company registration, in accordance with Article 6 of the Company Law, must be decided by the court and then carried out by the competent authority. The Xuchang Tobacco Co., Ltd. has already been approved for registration by the local competent authority. The request to cancel the registration was not brought to court and did not comply with the legal procedures. You are hereby informed.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Jinda University Professor Zhou Xianwen Discusses Currency Issues <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>China Should Persist in Its New Monetary Policy</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Zhou Xianwen, director of the Department of Business Administration at Jinda University, yesterday and discussed China's monetary issues. Zhou Min made the following comments (below are Mr. Zhou's words): According to the new monetary system promulgated in China on November 4, it was originally beneficial to the ups and downs of silver prices (the reverse being the fall in the value of our currency). In a sense, it can also be said to be the result of the United States implementing its silver purchase policy, which caused silver prices to continue to rise. Therefore, scholars have advocated taking the opportunity to sell silver and buy gold, and to adopt a de facto gold standard. However, it was not long before it was rumored that the United States' silver purchase policy would change, and London silver prices fell sharply. Now, taking Shanghai's gold standard as an example, since the currency reform, gold prices have been stable between 1,140 and 1,150 yuan, but now they have lost their normal state and have risen sharply (the reverse being the fall in silver prices), once reaching 1,200 yuan. Therefore, the idea of increasing customs duties and reducing foreign exchange has been widely spread in the market, and some scholars have once again advocated adopting a silver bullion standard. To say that a country's monetary system, which is of utmost importance to the national economy, can change with the rising and falling silver prices overseas, and can be either gold or silver, changing as frequently as morning and evening, is somewhat ridiculous. In my opinion, the difficulty China faces today is that it is caught in the crossfire of the economic policies of various countries and cannot be independent. If it leans to A, it will be damaged by B; if it leans to B, it will be attacked by C. Therefore, if our monetary system is to be truly effective, it must be based on the true liberation of the nation and the true independence of the country. As for the means of treating the symptoms, we must persist in the original intent of the authorities when issuing the currency system and gradually improve it based on the new facts.

<h3 id="e129">Petition from Sand Field Residents of Yuyao Arrives in Shanghai; Zhejiang General Association Sends Telegram of Appeal <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since Wu Xiangkun of the Provincial Committee took over the surveying and clearing of sand fields in Yuyao, his handling has been improper, leading to widespread resentment. The sand field residents of the entire county, unable to bear the oppression, have not only petitioned the provincial government and the Yuyao County government, but have also sent representatives to Shanghai, requesting the Zhejiang General Association and the Seven-County Fellow Townsmen Association of Shaoxing in Shanghai to uphold justice. The Zhejiang General Association, at its regular meeting today, resolved to provide assistance. The association's petition telegram to the provincial government is recorded below: "To Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: Wu Xiangkun, the commissioner for clearing sand fields in Yuyao, has ordered the advance payment of sand field land prices and clearing fees, illegally arresting villagers. Those detained in the Public Security Bureau are already overcrowded. He is still aggressively pursuing payments, acting like a madman. The county magistrate's advice is ignored. The people of Yuyao are terrified, as if facing a great disaster. Zhang Pin-san, Lu Hongyan, and other township chiefs, fearing a major incident and disturbance to public order, have come to Shanghai via a roundabout route to appeal on their behalf. In addition to submitting a separate telegram detailing the sand field disputes, we earnestly request your government to order the Yuyao County magistrate to promptly investigate and release the villagers detained for sand field matters to appease the people. We are deeply grateful." Signed, The Shanghai Zhejiang General Association.</p>

<p>Lawyer Refutes the Official Letter</p>
<p>Judge Orders Further Interrogation After Negotiation. Fan Tingzhang, a Ningbo native and owner of Lao Song Mao South Goods Store at the intersection of Ward Road and Jingzhou Road in the Public Concession, and Fan Wenzhao, his cousin and owner of Da Lai Printing Ink Factory at No. 12 Chong Rang Li, Fuzhou Road, previously, along with lawyer Sun Zuji, filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Wang Dongming, a Tianjin native and detective of the French Police, of privately handcuffing them, obstructing their freedom, and publicly insulting them, requesting the court to order the defendant to appear in court and be investigated according to law. Wang Wangxu, the president of the (Special First) Court, opened a court session on the 21st of this month, first summoning the plaintiffs to appear and inquire. Fan Wenzhao was unable to arrive in time due to business in Hankou, and only Fan Tingzhang, accompanied by his agent, lawyer Sun, appeared in court. The judge ordered a postponement for further trial. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Wang again summoned the parties in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant, Wang Dongming, did not appear. The plaintiffs, Fan Tingzhang and Fan Wenzhao, arrived with their lawyer. According to Fan Wenzhao's testimony, it was the same as Fan Tingzhang's previous testimony. The judge said to the two plaintiffs, "After this court sent the summons to the defendant, the police sent an official letter stating that you were indeed impersonating detectives at the time. Did you actually impersonate detectives?" The Fans replied in unison, "We went to mediate a dispute between my sister and her tenant. There was absolutely no impersonation of detectives." The plaintiff's lawyer explained to the court, "If the police believed that the two plaintiffs were impersonating detectives at the time, then why did the police not immediately prosecute them? Now, the police say that the plaintiffs impersonated detectives, which is not plausible." After reviewing the statements, the court ordered a postponement for further trial after negotiation, and the judge adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Qiu Heng's Poisoning Plot Foiled</p>
<p>Escaped While on Bail, Father Arrested</p>
<p>Qiu Hengzhong, a native of Hubei (34 years old), was a Western doctor and had a long-standing improper relationship with his widowed sister-in-law, Huiying. Last September, due to differing opinions, Huiying came to Shanghai in anger and rented a house in Xinxian Li, Hugunying, Nanshi. Qiu Hengzhong found out about this and followed her to Shanghai, staying at the home of his friend Li Xiyan (who worked as a court clerk in the Special First Court). He then found out Huiying's address and, together with Li Xiyan, invited Huiying to talk at the Yangzi Hotel, generously giving her travel expenses and asking her to leave Shanghai. Qiu and Huiying left together and took a Lilli taxi pre-hired by Li Xiyan to the Shanghai-Minhang South Zhe Road. Qiu Hengzhong suddenly became murderous, taking out cotton soaked in hydrochloric acid, morphine, and other poisons, which he had hidden on his person, intending to stuff it into his sister-in-law's mouth to harm her. Huiying saw this and struggled desperately, jumping out of the car. The taxi driver, seeing this, stopped the car in a panic and ran to inform the police, who arrested Qiu Hengzhong and brought him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office. After questioning, he was released on bail pending trial. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu's investigation was clear, and he was prosecuted for attempted murder. Judge He Jingcen repeatedly summoned him for questioning, but after Qiu Hengzhong was released on bail, he fled to Wuchang and remained at large. Later, the court found out where Qiu was hiding and sent police to Wuchang to bring Qiu back to Shanghai and detain him. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge He opened court again. The plaintiff, Qiu Huiyang, did not appear. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the detained Qiu Hengzhong to be brought to the dock. Qiu claimed, "I had arguments with my sister-in-law due to verbal conflicts and differing opinions, but the two bottles of medicine and cotton were not mine. It is a false accusation that I tried to harm her. Please investigate." After hearing the statement, the judge believed the case was clear and began the debate, which was concluded. The court would render a judgment at a later date, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Fake Handgun Discovered, Landlord and Landlady Come to Assist</p>
<p>Both Men, Along With Fan Yongkui, Were Taken Into Custody for Questioning</p>
<p>At around 10:00 PM the night before last, in a certain wine and vegetable restaurant at No. 600 Peng Road, just as it was about to close, two men speaking with a Chongming accent suddenly came to buy drinks and ordered the owner, Wen Jue-ting, to prepare exquisite wine and food for them to enjoy. The owner, thinking that customers were good for business, ordered the staff to do their best to entertain them. The two men sat at the table and ate heartily until around 11:00 PM, when the restaurant, having passed closing time, ordered the staff to close and advised the two men to stop drinking. At that time, the two men stopped drinking and asked the restaurant to settle the bill. Just then, one of the men suddenly said that he had forgotten to bring money, and the other man immediately said that he would go to a friend's place to borrow it, and then hurried out, telling his companion to wait for him in the restaurant. Unexpectedly, this man was gone for a long time and did not return. The restaurant, having no other choice, intended to hold the man's hat as collateral. In the midst of their dispute, Mr. Xu, a tenant from the floor above, heard the noise and came downstairs to investigate. He suddenly saw what appeared to be a weapon in the customer's sleeve, fearing that it would be harmful to the owner, so he grabbed the man from behind and snatched the object from his sleeve. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a fake handgun made of wood, looking very realistic. In the midst of the commotion, the owner's wife, Wen Li, returned from outside and saw another man outside the restaurant door, peeking in with a suspicious look. She quickly told the staff to run out and grab him, and then called the police to take them to the police station. Under questioning by the chief of police, they confessed that their names were Xue Qianglang and Tang Yingen, and that the fake handgun was given to them by a man named Fan Yongkui, hoping to do something illegal. After confirming Fan's address, detectives were dispatched to arrest Fan Yongkui, and together they were sent to court yesterday morning for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shen Xiaolin Buys People and Forces Them into Prostitution <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Zhong Yuedou Escapes from the Fire Pit</p>
<p>Zhong Yuebao, a young woman from Pinghu, now 24 years old, was tricked into coming to Shanghai by her husband, Yan Changfa, in the spring of 1931. For the price of 260 yuan, Yuebao was sold to Shen Xiaolin's family as a goddaughter, ostensibly to learn opera, but in reality, she was forced to engage in prostitution. Even in severe cold or heat, and even when sick, she had to walk the streets. If no patrons stayed overnight, she would be whipped by Shen Xiaolin. For years, Yuebao suffered unbearably. Last month, she seized an opportunity to escape from the fire pit, renting a house to the left of Fangban Bridge and working to support herself. Recently, Shen Xiaolin discovered this and sued Zhong Yuebao in the District Court Prosecutor's Office for absconding with property. After questioning, the prosecutor charged Shen Xiaolin with obstructing morality. Yesterday morning, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the court session. First, Zhong Yuebao testified about the previous situation, stating that every year, as soon as the lights came on, she had to run to various hotels, such as the Ping An, Jiang Tai, and An Le on Zhu Bao San Road, and the Dongfang Yuebin Hotel at Xiaodongmen. During the day, she had to run to Yong An, Sincere, and New World department stores. "This time, I couldn't bear the hardship anymore. Even when I had a venereal sore on my body, I was still forced to receive customers. So, on the fifth day of the eleventh month, I ran away." Next, the witness Li Chunshan testified that he was a tailor from Hubei working at the Ping An Hotel. "She (referring to Zhong Yuebao) has been running to the hotels since the Shanghai war started, so I know her." Finally, Shen Xiaolin testified, "When Zhong Yuebao first came to my house, she already had a venereal disease. It's true that she ran to the hotels and made business deals, but she only did it for two months and sold imported goods, so she deserves the punishment." The judge ordered him to be released on bail with a 500 yuan written guarantee, and without bail, he was to be detained. The judgment was scheduled for the 31st. Zhong Yuebao was dismissed from the court.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Xu Qizhong Borrows Money and Turns It into a Criminal Case <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer's Testimony Corroborates with Plaintiff</p>
<p>Defendant Claims to Have Copied the IOU and Signed the Check</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, son of Xu Guannan, resident of No. 61 North Zhejiang Road, borrowed 40,000 yuan from Wang Bingzhong (also known as Zhu Ping Song), a Portuguese national, on May 22nd of this year, using three land title deeds as collateral. Later, Wang discovered that the land title deeds were forged, so he negotiated with Xu. However, Xu, due to his weak intellect, fled to Hangzhou in a panic. Wang then posted a reward and issued a wanted notice in the newspaper. The Hangzhou Public Security Bureau located Xu and notified the Chengdu Road Police Station, which sent Detective Yang Xinzheng to Hangzhou to bring Xu Qizhong back to Shanghai. The police charged Xu with fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law and forgery of documents under Article 210. The Special Court had already interrogated him once and ordered the defendant to post 40,000 yuan bail pending trial. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui continued the trial of this case in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the adjournment, the police received an official letter from the court to investigate the Shanghai Bank on Rue Lafayette. According to manager Pan Bu-hou, who provided the account records, on May 22nd, the victim, Wang Bingzhong, had a deposit of 4,805.36 yuan. On the morning of the 23rd, another 2,900 yuan was deposited, bringing the total to 7,705.36 yuan. However, someone soon used check No. 313483 to withdraw 5,000 yuan. Later, Wang deposited 40,000 yuan in the bank on the same day, in eight installments of 5,000 yuan each. At the same time, someone also withdrew 40,000 yuan in eight installments, so Wang's deposit remained at 7,000 yuan when the accounts were settled at the end of the day. Judge Liu then ordered the witnesses to withdraw and be questioned separately. According to Wang Bingzhong's testimony, on May 23rd, he had a total deposit of over 47,000 yuan in the Shanghai Bank, and he presented the bank statement. "On May 22nd of this year, the defendant, Xu Qizhong, came to my office in Fuming Village, Rue Foochow, to borrow money, and insisted on my help. Because I knew Xu, I couldn't refuse, so I agreed. The guarantors on the IOU, Shen Shouheng, lawyers Shen Yiqian and Shen Boxiong, were all called by the defendant by telephone. The defendant personally wrote the IOU and handed over three land title deeds. Then I handed over eight checks, each for 5,000 yuan. This method was entirely proposed by the defendant. There was no stamp on the back of the check at that time. It was only later, when I retrieved the check from the bank, that I found the defendant's signature and stamp. When the IOU was signed, I was sitting facing south upstairs, lawyer Shen Yiqian was sitting facing north, the defendant was on my left, and Shen Shouheng and Shen Boxiong were walking back and forth in the room." The witnesses Shen Shouheng and lawyer Shen Yiqian successively testified about the situation at that time, and their statements were completely consistent with Wang Bingzhong's. Shen Yiqian even presented the defendant's handwritten power of attorney as evidence. When questioned, the defendant, Xu Qizhong, claimed, "The draft of the IOU has a bottom copy. He told me to copy the bill. The eight checks were also taken out by Wang, asking me to sign and stamp, and then he took them back. Wang gave me a bearer check for over 7,000 yuan to draw money. I went to the bank to withdraw the money myself!" The judge believed that the case still needed investigation and ordered a postponement to the 31st of this month for further trial. The defendant remained on the original bail.</p>

<p>More Than Two Thousand Impoverished People Drank Porridge</p>
<p>Ten Loads of Rice for Porridge Distributed in a Flash The Zhabei Charity Group's Liuying Road Porridge Kitchen officially opened at 5:00 AM yesterday. More than two thousand impoverished people drank porridge, and the ten loads of rice prepared for the porridge were distributed in an instant. The Great News Agency reporter provides the following record of the situation at the time:</p>
<p>Scene of Porridge Drinking</p>
<p>The kitchen started cooking at 5:00 AM yesterday, in the early morning light. However, the impoverished people, having heard the news, arrived at the kitchen as early as 3:00 AM, and the number of people waiting was quite large. As soon as the kitchen door opened, the impoverished people drinking porridge followed the old rule from last year, men on the left and women on the right, and entered the kitchen in an orderly fashion. They finished drinking at 8:00 AM. In total, over two thousand people drank the porridge, and ten loads of rice were distributed, which cooked six large vats of porridge.</p>
<p>Supervision on Site</p>
<p>Wang Binyan, director of the Charity Group, and Supervisor Cai Yuanfu, personally braved the frost to supervise the forty-odd employees at the kitchen, and also dispatched four members of the Zhabei Security Corps and four police officers from the local public security substation to supervise the scene. The number of porridge drinkers will definitely increase this morning, so they have prepared to cook an additional eight loads of rice, for a total of eighteen loads, to avoid complaints.</p>
<p>Admonishment to Staff</p>
<p>The group also posted a notice on the wall, admonishing the staff to work honestly. The following is a transcript: "This kitchen distributes porridge in winter, thanks to the kindness and compassion of many benefactors who donate rice. The opening of the porridge kitchen is especially worthy of sympathy for the ordinary people of Zhabei, men, women, old and young, who come to the kitchen to eat porridge. We hope that all employees will treat the charitable relief of the benefactors and the hunger and cold of the ordinary people with extra honesty. We hereby announce this."

<p>City Government Has Ordered the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to Handle It</p>
<p>This city is a mixture of Chinese and foreigners, and beggars generally beg along the streets, which not only obstructs traffic but also affects the appearance of the city. Although the local authorities have made every effort to crack down on them and send them to work-study centers, beggars, especially female beggars, still forcibly solicit alms on the roads. Most of them are refugees from various provinces who have come to Shanghai due to flooding. In view of this, the Women's Training Institute of the Shanghai Women's Temperance Association recently submitted a request to the city government through its host, Ms. Liu Wang Limin, to find a way to provide relief. Mayor Wu ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly handle it. According to Ms. Liu Wang Limin, who spoke to the National News Agency reporter yesterday, she has sent a letter to Cai Jingjun, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, outlining the measures to provide relief to women beggars, and it will be implemented soon.</p>

<p>Shenshe reports that Du Yuesheng's eldest son, Weifan, was married to Ms. Yanying, niece of Guangdong merchant tycoon Zheng Chongde, through the introduction of Zhang Xiaolin, Jin Ting-xun, Zhang Ruitang, and Zhu Zengpei, yesterday afternoon. The wedding hall was located at the New World Restaurant on Guizhou Road. Mr. Du did not want to make a show of it, so he did not send out wedding invitations in advance, but those who came to congratulate him upon hearing the news were still very crowded. No less than four thousand people from military, political, business, and academic circles attended. The road was packed with cars and horses, and the scene was extremely grand. The old French Concession police specially dispatched more than ten Chinese and foreign detectives to take care of the situation, and the order was well maintained. The wedding ceremony was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and the wedding was officiated by Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Yu Qiaqing. Yuan Ludeng served as the master of ceremonies. The bride and groom were led by the bridesmaids Zhang Huifen, Ding Jingying, and Chen Yimei, and the groomsmen Gao Shangde, Yu Yunjia, and Ye Linquan, and walked slowly into the wedding hall, followed by two children, Zhang Jue and Zhang Zhe, carrying flower baskets and costumes. The Garrison Headquarters and the Public Works Bureau band played the wedding march. The guests were represented by Gu Weijun, who delivered a congratulatory speech. The ceremony was simple and solemn, and all the guests praised it. A wedding banquet was also held in the evening, and the guests and hosts were all happy. The party broke up late into the night.</p>

<p>On New Year's Day of the 25th year [of the Republic], it will be the 70th birthday of Madam Zhou, mother of Mr. Yu Zuoting. Mr. Zuoting, respectfully following his mother's wishes, given the national crisis and the people's suffering, dared not engage in extravagance. Colleagues from the local Chamber of Commerce, admiring Madam Yu's virtuous conduct and exemplary principles for a long time, had decided to prepare a special celebration. Originally, they planned to invite famous performers like Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu to entertain, but Madam Yu sternly instructed Mr. Zuoting to politely decline, deeming it inappropriate to hold any celebrations. It is also heard that all the feast funds will be diverted to winter relief, to benefit all relatives and friends. The funds are currently being distributed and will soon be handed over to various charities for distribution, so that disaster victims can share in the coming of spring.</p>

<p>Xiang Sheng Company Complies with Regulations</p>
<p>One Dollar for a Single Trip</p>
<p>The Municipal Council, in order to facilitate citizens' travel to the city center area, had consulted with relevant bureaus and agreed on a uniform car fare. The regulations stipulate that, except for the Caohejing area, for trips to and from the city center area from districts like Hu Nan and Zhabei, as well as the two Special Districts, without any stops in between, the fare is one dollar per single trip. Last month, Xiang Sheng Company submitted a request to the bureau, agreeing to abide by the above regulations. They established a branch on Guohe Road in the city center area. However, the company subsequently published a statement, stipulating that the one-dollar fare for the city center area was still limited to twenty minutes, which was clearly inconsistent with the bureau's agreed-upon regulations. The bureau immediately ordered the company to correct the statement and report back. It is now learned that the company has responded, clarifying that the one-dollar fare for a single trip in the city center area has no twenty-minute time limit.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Kuai Huo Lin Film Company - Case of Defaming Qing Xin Girls' High School <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Both Agents Claim Reconciliation is Still in Progress</p>
<p>Court Reschedules Hearing to January 4th of Next Year</p>
<p>Qing Xin Girls' High School, located in the Nanshi area of this city, on Lujiabang, was founded by the Presbyterian Church and has a history of seventy-five years. It is a famous girls' school in Shanghai. The school's facilities and operations are in accordance with the educational principles of the Republic of China and the decrees issued by the Ministry of Education. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], it was approved for registration by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and has received repeated commendations. It enjoys a deep social trust, and the school's affairs are flourishing, with over nine hundred students. The school's management is very strict. All students must wear uniforms, and even on holidays, students are not allowed to go out without a significant reason, even if parents request leave. This is to instill discipline and prevent them from being contaminated by the bad habits of society. Recently, the Kuai Huo Lin Film Company's film "Little Aunt," starring actress Xia Peizhen, contained photographs and text involving Qing Xin Girls' High School. After Ms. Zhang Rongzhen, the current principal of Qing Xin Girls' High School, learned of this and went to see the film, she believed that the drama portrayed in the film deliberately defamed Qing Xin Girls' High School. Principal Zhang, in her capacity as the legal representative of Qing Xin Girls' High School, entrusted lawyer Zhou Yingcai to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Zhang Bingsheng, the manager of Kuai Huo Lin Film Company, and Min Qian, the screenwriter and director, of deliberately spreading words and pictures to defame the school, requesting legal investigation in accordance with Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. According to the indictment, in this year's film "Little Aunt," produced by Kuai Huo Lin Film Company, the plot involves a female student named Chen Lianzhen, who undergoes a sudden change in attitude after entering Qing Xin Girls' High School. She becomes fond of wearing fancy clothes, climbs over the school wall, enters and exits dance halls at will, and commits adultery with her sister's husband, named Yan Shaohua, disrupting her sister's family. Most hatefully, the film prominently features the school's large plaque with the six characters "Qing Xin Girls' High School," displayed in major theaters, making it clear to the audience that the events take place in the plaintiff's school. After being informed, the plaintiff went to see the film at the Southeast Grand Theater in the French Concession and immediately instructed a lawyer to send a warning letter. The defendants ignored it, thus deliberately defaming the school, requesting investigation and, furthermore, seeking civil compensation, demanding that the defendants compensate for losses, destroy the "Little Aunt" film, and publish apologies and corrections in major newspapers to avoid misunderstandings. The court approved the request and had Judge Sun Pengham summon the defendants for a hearing. Only Zhang Bingsheng, one of the defendants, sent a lawyer to represent him. As both parties agreed to reconciliation, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday morning, the hearing was to be resumed, but Ms. Zhang Rongzhen, the principal of Qing Xin Girls' High School, the plaintiff, was represented by a lawyer, who stated that the plaintiff was unable to attend due to school matters. Zhang Bingsheng, the defendant, was also represented by a lawyer, who stated that Zhang Bingsheng was unable to attend due to illness. The whereabouts of the second defendant, Min Qian, are unknown. Although the summons was received by the first defendant, it could not be delivered. Both lawyers stated that the case was currently under reconciliation and had not yet been resolved, requesting a one-week postponement to resolve the matter. The court agreed and postponed the hearing to January 4th of the 25th year, instructing both lawyers that if reconciliation is achieved outside of court, they should promptly submit a request to withdraw the complaint. Both lawyers complied and withdrew.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Association, noting that the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee had reached its quota for loans to traditional Chinese medicine stores, sent a letter requesting an expansion of the loan quota to continue lending. They received a reply granting the request. The original letter from the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee is reproduced below: "Regarding your association's letter, document number 38, requesting an expansion of the loan quota for the traditional Chinese medicine industry to continue lending for widespread benefit and to revive the market, we have approved the request. However, for prudence in future lending, it must be certified by the association. Therefore, we will continue lending to meet the needs. Large-scale traditional Chinese medicine stores can still apply for credit loans through the usual procedures. Smaller pharmacies should follow the example of the noodle industry and other associations, using joint guarantees and applying for small loans of up to one hundred yuan with the association's certification. We hereby reply and request that you inform the relevant parties accordingly. This is addressed to the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Association.

<h3 id="e150">Municipal Council Schools - Prospects for Promoting Graduates' Employment are Promising <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Excellent Students to be Registered</p>
<p>At a recent meeting of the Municipal Council's Education Committee, the Health Department suggested that outstanding graduates from the Municipal Council's schools should be employed as trainees or clerks by various departments of the Municipal Council, to broaden students' employment prospects. According to the department's report, there are currently four vacancies for trainees, with an age requirement of around twenty-one. It is preferred that they have been out of school for some time and have some understanding of the world. The deputy director of the department stated that most of the trainees currently employed by the department come from the Municipal Council's schools. The current practice is that when the department has vacancies, the Education Committee informs the school authorities or student associations, who then select students with exceptional character and academic performance to be trainees. However, there is no explicit regulation, so the deputy director strongly desires that the Municipal Council establish regulations for outstanding graduates of the Municipal Council's schools to broaden their employment prospects. The director of the Education Department also stated that other departments of the Municipal Council are adopting this method, such as the Police Department, which employs Chinese trainees and gradually promotes them to the position of Chinese Deputy Inspector. A committee member immediately stated that the employment of graduates from Municipal Council schools should not be limited to the Health Department and the Police Department. Other departments should also consider employing them, and it should not be limited to male students. Female students should also have equal opportunities, and it should not be limited to Chinese youth. Westerners should also be treated equally. Thus, this issue involves the provision of vocational education. However, the Municipal Council is limited in its economic resources for vocational education, and the issues are complex, making it difficult to address all aspects at once. For example, home economics classes for girls' schools have not yet been established. After discussion, it was decided that the director of the Education Department should propose regulations on how to register students from Municipal Council schools who achieve certain scores in their graduation examinations, to give them priority for employment by the Municipal Council in the future. It is reported that the above regulations proposed by the Education Committee have been approved by the Municipal Council's board of directors.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed the two Railway Bureaus, stating that the United Federation of the National Chinese Medicine Industry Association had submitted a request to revise the regulations for the transportation of pharmaceuticals such as acetic acid, carbolic acid, and liquid ammonia. After investigation, acetic acid, carbolic acid, and liquid ammonia are essential pharmaceutical products. To maintain the medical supply, the Ministry approves adding the above three pharmaceuticals to the list of dangerous goods with a minimum shipping quantity of fifty kilograms, effective January 21st of the 25th year. However, to prevent accidents, the packaging methods for the above pharmaceuticals should be communicated to the pharmaceutical merchants. All shipments must be packed in wooden crates filled with wood shavings. However, the item "Ammonia Water" listed in the appendix of the 10th order of the Ye Zi Department from January 10th of the 23rd year should be removed. In addition to the instructions, you are instructed to comply and report back." The bureau has instructed the Transportation Department to comply and report back.</p>

<p>Cheng Caiyun Robbed</p>
<p>Ms. Cheng Caiyun was robbed yesterday around 12:20 PM, about three hundred steps from a police post. She was going to visit her relative, Wu Xingyu, at 160 Danfeng Road. After visiting, she planned to go to the City God Temple to offer incense. Unexpectedly, while walking through the entrance of Anren Lane on Wutong Street, two burly robbers, wearing black jackets and appearing to be in their twenties, blocked her way with pistols. They ordered her to remain silent and snatched a gold bracelet worth over seventy yuan before fleeing west towards Xiaopilu. She reported the incident to the City God Temple Police Station, who dispatched officers to search for the robbers, but they had already fled. It was determined that the incident occurred approximately three hundred steps from the Dongyuanmen post. The police station has reported the incident to the General Bureau, instructing the Detective Team to make an arrest and handle the case strictly.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Another Municipal Council Tax Dispute <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Huang Renlong Unwilling to Pay Taxes</p>
<p>Lawyer Huang Renlong previously leased premises from the Shanghai Bank at the intersection of Qipu Road, opposite the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, to establish a law firm. At the end of September of this year, due to the relocation of the law firm, he terminated the lease agreement with the landlord. However, the Municipal Council's Tax Office has recently continued to collect the property tax for the summer, autumn, and winter quarters of this year. Huang argued that since he had vacated the premises on October 1st, he should not be responsible for the tax for October, November, and December. He refused to pay. The Municipal Council subsequently filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Local Court, requesting Huang to appear in court for mediation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Meng Tingke opened the court. Huang Renlong presented the court's judgment on the termination of the lease agreement with the landlord, proving that he had indeed vacated the premises on October 1st. He also stated that someone else was responsible for the tax for the summer and autumn quarters and that he could not be collected from him. The representative of the Municipal Council's Tax Office stated that the outstanding tax should be paid by Huang. As mediation failed, Judge Meng ordered both parties to withdraw and instructed the plaintiff to file a formal lawsuit for hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Adopted Son Requests Recognition of Status <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Lan Sheng Files for Mediation Against Father Tang Ziyi</p>
<p>Tang Ziyi adopted a son, Lan Sheng, years ago. After Lan Sheng grew up, Tang became increasingly degenerate and self-destructive, so he expelled him and published a declaration renouncing their father-son relationship. Several years have passed, and they have had no contact with each other. Recently, Tang Lan Sheng suddenly missed his father and requested permission to return home. Ziyi refused, so Lan Sheng filed a lawsuit against Ziyi in court, seeking recognition of their parent-child relationship. The result was a complete failure. Now, Lan Sheng has hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Tribunal of the First Special District Court, stating that he is Ziyi's adopted son, requesting that his father be summoned to court to confirm his adopted son status. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Meng opened the court. Lan Sheng stated that his father had previously listened to his stepmother and expelled him. However, Ziyi also hired a lawyer to appear in court and oppose Lan Sheng's claims. The court declared that mediation had failed, so the case will have to proceed to formal litigation.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Old Deeds Mortgaged for Certificate Registration <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Deadline of Three Months, No Longer Accepted After Deadline</p>
<p>Mortgages with old deeds have long been a common practice in Shanghai. However, many people still do not apply to the Land Bureau for certificate exchange and registration. Once a dispute arises, requests are often submitted to the bureau to prevent the issuance of certificates, etc. The bureau generally rejects these requests because the proper procedures have not been followed. As there are still many old deeds mortgaged and held by the people, it seems appropriate to give them the opportunity to exchange and register their certificates. Director Cai of the Land Bureau has set a deadline and issued a public notice to the people of the city. The public notice is reproduced below: "After the Land Bureau has surveyed and issued land ownership certificates in the surveyed areas of the city, all transfers and mortgages by owners have been subject to the rules and procedures established by the bureau. In areas that have not been surveyed, the sale of old deeds has also been subject to established procedures. However, there are still many old deeds mortgaged and held by the people. The people are accustomed to complacency or are mutually constrained, and they often do not apply for certificate exchange. Once a dispute arises, requests are often submitted to the bureau to prevent the issuance of certificates and transfers. Since these mortgages with old deeds do not comply with the regulations for certificate exchange and registration with the bureau, it seems that they should not be subject to stop issuance and transfer orders. However, it is not appropriate to not give the opportunity to exchange and register existing land deeds for mortgages. The bureau has decided to set a deadline of three months. Regardless of whether the land has been surveyed or not, if there are any mortgages with old deeds, the mortgagee and mortgagor must come to the bureau together to exchange certificates or survey and exchange certificates, and at the same time apply for land certificate mortgage registration. If disputes arise after the deadline, and requests are submitted to the bureau to stop the issuance and transfer of certificates, they will not be accepted. As for those who have previously submitted disputes over mortgages to the bureau, they will be temporarily allowed to stop the issuance and transfer of certificates, but they must still pay the land mortgage registration fee according to the fee schedule (it must be noted in the registration that the issuance and transfer of certificates are stopped, which is called signing and registering). In this way, mortgages with old deeds can be cleared up and certificates exchanged as soon as possible. The above measures have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. A public notice is hereby issued to the people of the city, so that all landowners with old deeds mortgaged should comply with the above deadline and come to the bureau to exchange certificates without further delay. The notice is hereby issued. December 28th, 24th year of the Republic of China. Cai Zengji, Director of the Land Bureau (acting)."</p>

For the sake of the industry, please ask Mr. Zhang to go and persuade them to hand them over. The price of tallow oil remains the same: white wax is uniformly 125 yuan, and rice wicks are reduced by 5 yuan.</p>

People outside the industry who do not fully understand postal procedures or want to study postal science can use it as a good reference. Other sections, such as Postal News and the Appendix, also publish various postal regulations that are not easily accessible to the outside world. The "Chronicle of Major Events of Domestic and Foreign Workers" is an important reference material for those studying labor issues.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I have just read a news item in today's newspaper regarding the case of unpaid shares of the Lixiang Hotel, which is inconsistent with the facts. The shares under Mr. Li's name were purchased through my introduction. After the store closed, I visited Mr. Li several times. Moreover, my address has not changed for six years, so the claim that I am avoiding him is certainly not true. As this concerns my personal reputation, I hope you will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the matter. Sincerely, Hu Xiongzheng, December 28th. To the Editor, I read in today's local news that Wang Zhongguo, a second-year student at Fudan High School, was sentenced for a conflict with a Western policeman. After investigation, there is no such person in our high school or affiliated middle school and experimental middle school. Moreover, no student of our school has been sued by the police. We hereby declare this and kindly request a correction. Sincerely, Fudan University, October 28, Year 24.</p>
<p>Note: Yesterday, I received four cans of Platinum Dragon cigarettes, four artistic picture cards, and a set of calendars from the Nanyang Tobacco Company. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Chinese Basketball Court Packed to the Brim Lianghua Loses to Pirates Yesterday <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>31 to 35 A Big Disappointment for Fans</p>
<p>Lianghua, Three Wins and One Loss, Returns North Tomorrow</p>
<p>Lianghua vs. Pirates, last night at the Shenyuan basketball court as a final game before leaving Shanghai, that is, the final competition with the Pirates. People in Shanghai, admiring the deep skills of the two teams, although in the midst of this rainy weather, gathered in groups, heading to the secluded Yanping Road. The basketball court was filled with more than 3,000 people, almost making it difficult to breathe, a truly unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<p>Three Thousand Fans</p>
<p>The reason why this game attracted such great attention is that the Pirates have been dominating Shanghai for five years, and I don't know how many times the Chinese teams in Shanghai have been ravaged by them. Lianghua's five tigers defeated them with a score of 50 to 43 the night before, avenging two years of resentment. Therefore, everyone wanted to witness the event and find out what happened. Moreover, the tickets were only sold for half a yuan, a low price, which contributed to the turnout. Even reporters from various newspapers were barred from entering the venue.</p>
<p>Forced to Start</p>
<p>It was learned that the tickets for last night were purchased as early as 4:00 PM, and were sold out by 6:00 PM. The venue was already packed to the brim. The audience, blocked outside the bamboo fence, gathered more and more, and even rushed in, making it impossible to maintain order. When the game was about to start, the audience was standing more than two feet past the boundary line. In this cramped situation, the game was forced to start.</p>
<p>Heroes Nod</p>
<p>It is heard that the Lianghua team will return to the north tomorrow. This time they came to Shanghai again, and fought four fierce battles with Chinese and Western powerhouses. They first defeated McLeans, then defeated Jinan, and then defeated the Pirates. Yesterday they were defeated by the Pirates, with three wins and one loss, a brilliant record. The Association specially presented a silver cup with the inscription "Heroes Nod" to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Being Inferior</p>
<p>Lianghua and Pirates played their second game at the Shenyuan basketball court last night. The game was not able to start until 8:00 PM. The two armies started contact in a crowd, and the Pirates won the opening victory. They led all the way and always occupied the first place. Although Lianghua tried hard to catch up, they finally lost with a score of 11 to 19 in the first half. The 3,000 fans, in high spirits, all felt unhappy. In the second half, Lianghua vowed not to give in, and worked hard to improve. The closest they got was 33 to 30, only three points apart. But in the end, they still lost with a score of 35 to 31. The referee was Qu Hongren, and the inspector was Sullivan.</p>
<h3 id="e186">YMCA Basketball Hope Weakens Jinan Loses to McLeans <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>One Point Difference 39 to 41</p>
<p>Missed Free Throws the Main Reason for Failure</p>
<p>Last night's YMCA basketball A-League game between McLeans and Jinan was extremely exciting. McLeans relied on Abada Jia's throw in the last 30 seconds to beat Jinan 41 to 39. McLeans' victory depended entirely on its tall stature and intercepting the ball under the basket, making it impossible for Jinan to stop them, thus creating this tense situation. Jinan's yesterday was its first defeat in the YMCA competition, but it was unexpectedly defeated so unfortunately. The effort and agile sharpness are commendable, but the shooting lacks certainty and the free throws were missed. Out of McLean's fifteen fouls, only six points were scored. In an ideal and advanced team, there should not be such a shortcoming. Yesterday's defeat was one of the main reasons.</p>
<p>Fierce and Exciting</p>
<p>The first half was 25 to 19, with Jinan winning by six points. The performance was wonderful and the game was fierce. After Wang Nanzhen exceeded 12 to 10, everything went smoothly from then on. Unexpectedly, McLeans scored as many as eleven points in a row in the second half. But Jinan did not show any weakness. With its courageous fight, it still went from equal to exceeding. When McLeans took the lead again, Jinan tried its best to counterattack. The excitement of the emotions was no less than the previous war between Lianghua and the Pirates. In the end, Jinan made the score even at 39. In the tense battle, McLean's Abada Jia casually threw a ball from behind the oblique side, which hit the center of the basket, and the time ended. Thus, Jinan was miserably defeated.</p>
<p>Shooting Requires Hard Work</p>
<p>Jinan is the only remaining Chinese team among the winners of the current YMCA competition, and is also considered the most promising team. It is enough to compete with the Pirates. Yesterday's defeat made the Pirates the sole leader, and the hope of winning the championship is even greater. But Jinan's future still has the possibility of reappearing. With the advancing McLean, there is a great hope of defeating the Pirates, and Jinan must also fight the Pirates! Only if they can win can they still be proud. However, the team must work hard on shooting, and especially pay attention to free throws. Strive for it, strive for it.</p>
<p>Jinan Leads by Six Points After the start of the game, McLeans scored three points with a penalty and a throw. Jinan's Li and Wang returned the favor in the same way. Qiongsheng scored again, and Han Zhenyuan tucked the ball in under the basket, making it 5 to 5. Then it became 7 to 7 and 10 to 10. Wang Nanzhen succeeded in a long shot, and began to show his prowess with 12 to 10. After this, Jinan's spirit was vigorous and its momentum was intensified. Han Kuang Yin each made outstanding contributions, threatening McLeans with 18 to 11. After Biers chased up four points, Yao Ya added two points, with a difference of 23 to 15, at its peak. McLeans relied on the strength of the tall Griffith and Qiongsheng, creating 19 to 25. Ending the first half, Jinan took the lead with six points.</p>
<p>Ultimately Failing</p>
<p>Re-entering the battle, Jinan was negligent in defense. In fact, it was also because the opponents were tall and long-handed, and they could not resist them. They often fouled. McLeans gained momentum in one go, scoring eleven points in a row, 25 to 30. Jinan was inferior instead. McLeans was in full swing, and Jinan was unlucky. Cai Yanxiong was suddenly fined at this time, replaced by Xu Rongshui, attacking and fighting bravely, and fighting desperately. Yin returned with a look, creating 28 to 30. Han Zhen missed two free throws, and sighs were endless. Wang Nanzhen was unwilling, and gave a long shot, which was indeed successful, and then became a draw. Added to that Yin Guiren's half-court remote shot, adding to the icing on the cake, and again exceeded with 34 to 32. How could he know that McLeans used tall people to surround the basket to attack, and Jinan had no way to stop it. Soon McLeans won again with 39 to 34. Jinan struggled for the last time. After 39 to 39, McLean's Abada Jia threw a ball at random, which actually decided the outcome, and the spectators all sighed for Jinan.</p>
<p>The results of the other two games are as follows: Tongwen beat Moore 20 to 17, the first half was 9 to 9. Guoguang beat Mingqiang 40 to 31, the first half was 21 to 15.</p>

Among yesterday's games, the one between Qingpu and Maotai was more intense, while the others were one-sided. The Qingbai vs. China game of the Women's Dahua Cup was unusually brilliant. Qingbai played with only four people in the first game, but was still able to win 21 to 19, which was unexpected. In the end, they defeated China by two to one. The other two games, Erhong Industrial Bureau vs. Minli and Wuben vs. Dongya, were evenly matched and the scores were very close.</p>

<p>At this point, Rob appeared again, cautiously bringing what Asey called a "small biscuit," meaning baked in the shape of a small dish.</p>
<p>"The filling in this has some of the blackberries that I picked. I'll give you half at dinner," he announced proudly and solemnly.</p>
<p>Nanen gently asked, "What made you think of treating me so well when I was so naughty?"</p>
<p>"Because we got lost together. You won't be naughty again, will you?"</p>
<p>"Never," Nanen said, speaking with great determination.</p>
<p>"Oh, good! Now I'm going to Amelie to have her cut it up for us so we can eat it; it's almost dinner time," Rob said, waving the little sweet biscuit to encourage her to come with him.</p>
<p>Nanen was about to go with him when she suddenly stopped and said:</p>
<p>"I forgot, I can't go."</p>
<p>"Just try," Mrs. Pei said, seeing that she had secretly untied the rope while she was talking to Rob.</p>
<p>Seeing that she was free again, Nanen eagerly kissed Mrs. Shu, and then rushed away, as swift as a bird, followed by Rob, as the berry juice dripped from his hand along the way.</p>

<p>3. High School Wartime Work Plan</p>
<p>A. Organizational System</p>
<p>The wartime work organization of high schools is based on the original military training and first aid organizations.</p>
<p>The organizational system takes the school's wartime work committee as the highest authority, the team as the central organization, and the group as the basic organization.</p>
<p>Groups are divided according to the nature of the work, such as first aid groups and fire-fighting groups. Each group has about ten people, regardless of class.</p>
<p>If there are several groups for one type of work, they are called "Group Number X of So-and-So" (such as the Firefighting Group), and there is a joint group meeting for communication and progress.</p>
<p>Each student should join a group according to their abilities and interests, and each group elects one representative.</p>
<p>Three or four groups form a team.</p>
<p>Each team has a captain and vice-captain, appointed by the principal from teachers and students.</p>
<p>Teachers are natural consultants for each group.</p>
<p>Staff and workers are free to participate in the work of a certain group.</p>
<p>The school's wartime work committee has five departments: (1) Personnel Registration, (2) Needs Investigation, (3) Skills Training, (4) Academic Guidance, and (5) Social Work.</p>
<p>Each country is both a component of the team and subject to the jurisdiction of the corresponding department of the school committee in order to ensure the consistency of the school's work.</p>
<p>The organizational chart of each level of group is as follows:</p>
<p>B. Work Outline</p>
<p>Distribute questionnaires to investigate each person's abilities and interests.</p>
<p>Categorize and register various wartime personnel.</p>
<p>Dispatch students to designated areas to investigate the needs in various aspects of wartime.</p>
<p>Change the original teaching time of each subject, extracting twelve hours per week to teach new wartime teaching materials. The distribution method for the extracted time is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Entirely extracted</p>
<p>(2) Extracted by half</p>
<p>(3) No time extracted, Suan Wei (arithmetic), ethics.</p>
<p>Supplement the new wartime teaching materials compiled by the provincial wartime work committee according to local conditions.</p>
<p>The teaching of new wartime teaching materials is the responsibility of the original teachers of each subject, but local experts may also be invited to serve as instructors.</p>
<p>Disseminate wartime news at any time.</p>
<p>Practical work should especially focus on the training of several technologies.</p>
<p>In addition to general work, practical work focuses on the following items, which are undertaken by groups. Each week, a total of six hours of training is conducted.</p>
<p>1. Writing news articles and oral propaganda. 2. Intensifying military training. 3. Female student first aid training. 4. Making gas masks. 5. Making fire extinguishers. 6. Investigating the required quantity of daily necessities. 7. Investigating and manufacturing military supplies. 8. Digging cellars. 9. Building roads, directing vehicles. 10. Connecting military electrical lines. 11. Maintaining public order. 12. Teaching the public.</p>
<p>The principal supervises and inspects the work situation at any time, and the local wartime work committee sends personnel to inspect on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In addition to government funding, the funds required for wartime work training are freely donated by staff and students.</p>
<p>C. Implementation Steps</p>
<p>The principal convenes an emergency wartime meeting to discuss wartime work preparations. The members of the school's wartime work committee take an oath. Teachers go to the local wartime work committee for training. Investigate the abilities and wishes of all staff, students, workers, and staff. Announce the names of the members of each group. Each group elects a representative. Form the middle team. The school committee investigates wartime needs and informs each team to be responsible for meeting them separately. Hold team meetings to formulate a work plan. Raise funds to purchase equipment. Implement training. Start work.</p>

<p>Difficult National Situation, Therefore No Celebration</p>
<p>Set Goals and Work Earnestly</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School in Jiangwan, Shanghai, was founded 15 years ago. After several setbacks, Principal Lu Lihua is determined to promote women's physical education and cultivate talents. After working hard, the school is becoming more and more prosperous. The current site covers nearly 50 acres, and the school buildings are gradually being built. The environment is quiet, which is especially a good place for reading and writing. Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the school's founding. Due to the difficult national situation, there was no celebration. At 9:00 AM, all the teachers and students held a simple memorial ceremony in the auditorium. Principal Lu gave a moving report on the difficult struggles of the past ten years and expressed great hope for future progress. According to the school's first-step reconstruction plan after the January 28th Incident, the plan has been achieved. Its second-step plan, such as building a gymnasium, library, and general office building, is being planned. School directors, faculty, staff, students, and alumni are actively working together for the future of the school, hoping to achieve the entire realization in the near future. Buried in hard work, earnestly carry out, which is helpful to the development of women's physical education prospects, is very significant.</p>

<p>The vast world is originally an enlarged kaleidoscope. As long as you open your eyes to look, you can see all kinds of colors and bizarre sights, often beyond your expectations. Every strange thing, before you have witnessed it with your own eyes, you always think it will never happen; who knows that once you see it, this will happen, which makes you exclaim strangely. In the city, there are many people, and strange things are constantly evolving there. We coldly watch, which is the most meaningful. Whether it's a scale, a claw, or a fragment, they all have value for your observation and recording, so you can see people's hearts, and see the world change, and make scholars who study society get some reference materials. This magazine recently opened a new column "Notes on What I Saw", which is what it means. Unexpectedly, for two weeks, contributors have been pouring in, and it is impossible to publish them all. Well, let's publish a special page.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Notes on What I Saw (1) <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Shouqiu</p>
<p>Outside Shuixi Gate in the capital, there is a large stone bridge, and there are many children in ragged clothes at both ends of the bridge. These children stand at both ends of the bridge all day long, because they also have their expectations. What are their expectations? That is to wait for the small vendors carrying baskets and the coal deliverymen pushing handcarts to cross the bridge, so that they can steal from them, even rob openly.</p>
<p>One afternoon, I saw with my own eyes a woman carrying a basket selling eggs. These children stole a lot of eggs, because their stealing skills are very clever, so the woman didn't realize it. It wasn't until passers-by told her that more than twenty eggs had been stolen from the basket! The woman's capital was at stake, and she couldn't help crying loudly!</p>
<p>This phenomenon seems to be an important issue in society, right? I hope the police authorities pay attention to it.</p>

<p>— Xufeng</p>
<p>Last year, I once sailed the sea. The sea was vast, and I saw many flying fish.</p>
<p>Flying fish can leave the water and fly, probably as a special way to avoid enemies. It is said that there are large fish in the water that want to eat flying fish, so I have seen dozens of fleeing flying fish fly out of the water, use their tails to propel themselves in the water, and leap into the air. A pair of pectoral fins, almost the same length as the body, spread out like wings, supporting the body to make three or four wave-like movements in the air, and then return to the water more than ten feet away from the starting point?</p>
<p>Ah! Unfortunate flying fish, although flying in the air to avoid strong enemies in the water, but there are also groups of gulls and crows in the air, waiting eagerly. Therefore, I have also seen several flying fish sacrificed. The weak in the world really have no happy land anywhere!</p>

<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>In the cold winter morning, our Xinghua people's habit is that after getting up every day, for washing faces, gargling, drinking tea, etc., we need hot water, and hot water must be bought from the tea stove. The tea stove burns reed grass, and rice husks. The colder the weather, the colder the water, and it can't be boiled quickly. More and more people gather. Wherever there is a tea stove in the streets and alleys, it is always lively and crowded. The cold wind is blowing, and the cold is piercing. To seek heat (water), you must first suffer the cold. A group of friends who buy hot water are shrinking their necks, stretching their heads, their hands and feet are cold, and they are looking eagerly. This can really leave a microcosm for those who are enthusiastic. The more you look at it with a hot heart, the more you will be splashed with a basin of cold water, which makes you uneven in hot and cold, and you really don't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

<p>— Huang Lian</p>
<p>Yesterday, our Si'an city was performing "rewarding the gods opera"!</p>
<p>On the stage, I saw a young modern woman from another place, holding a small dog in her hand!</p>
<p>Next to the theater, there was a food stall selling beef vermicelli. I saw the woman throwing pieces of beef from the stall into the dog's mouth!</p>
<p>Finally, the woman took out a two-corner auxiliary currency note from her leather bag and left.</p>
<p>At this time, the two beggars sitting on the ground looked at it with envy! So they chased after her and begged: "Miss! Do a good deed!" But they got nothing!</p>

<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>Time: 4:52 PM on a certain day in December.</p>
<p>Location: National Loan Company.</p>
<p>A handsome middle-aged man was selecting woolen undershirts on the south-facing cabinet. He was wearing a gabardine coat, a blue-gray woolen hat, and satin small round-mouth shoes. Although he couldn't be called "a man of outstanding appearance," he was still a man of property.</p>
<p>But he started stealing things. He took advantage of the gap to stuff a soft, snow-white woolen undershirt into his coat pocket. Unexpectedly, the attempt failed, and a clerk spotted him. So several people rushed forward, twisting and roaring, and the rest of the clerks also shouted and cheered, shouting "Catch the thief!"</p>
<p>He stammered, unable to speak, only mumbling vaguely:</p>
<p>"I want to buy it, I want to buy it..."</p>
<p>But he was finally twisted into the manager's office by a clerk.</p>
<p>I thought silently: Beautiful people are smart, and evil deeds are also the work of smart people.</p>

<p>— Jiachensheng</p>
<p>In public buses or trams, men and women giving up their seats is almost a common sight and nothing rare.</p>
<p>Giving up seats was originally a Western custom. Our noble compatriots are full of arrogance and imitative nature. Giving up seats is a virtue. Being able to imitate is certainly not a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, if we examine these seat-givers more carefully, the seats they give up are all given to modern girls. No matter how unsteady the old ladies are, no one will be polite. Situations like this can be seen anytime and anywhere. The virtue of giving up seats, perhaps should be like this for fashionable people. What a strange thing!</p>
<h3 id="e216">Notes on What I Saw (7) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to the zoo and saw a woman on Wenmiao Road strip a child under one year old naked, hide him in her chest, and kneel on the ground crying. People who passed by gave her copper coins, pitying the child blowing in the wind naked. On our road, there is often a young beggar carrying an eighty-year-old mother on his back, with gray hair and a sack over her, shouting "My old mother" and begging. Everyone will give him money, pitying his old mother. The former uses the child, and the latter uses the old mother. Isn't the young woman and the strong man both good at doing work and doing small business to support the child and the old mother? However, it is always easier and less laborious to use the old and the young to beg for money.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Notes on What I Saw (8) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zuichiao</p>
<p>When Guangxi Road reaches 8 o'clock in the evening, a large public food stall will rest on the sidewalk. Many coolies and rickshaw pullers will come together to buy a few copper coins' worth of rice, and he will buy a few copper coins' worth of porridge. Side dishes are free and don't cost money. So that group of hungry people surround and eat, and with full bellies, they fight with the bad environment again; indeed, this public food stall is their only merciful God!</p>
<p>On a rainy night yesterday, they were still eating in the open air as usual. An officer came from afar with his chest out and his belly protruding, and his solemn face was enough to make them shudder! "Damn, go away, go into the lane, foreigners don't allow selling," the food stall owner almost cried, begging repeatedly: "Spare me, small business is very troubled"! "Damn, no, go into the lane!" The stronger person roared: Those coolies and rickshaw pullers came to plead together: "Please let him go; otherwise, we will have to go hungry, please do a good deed," The food stall owner, with a mournful face, trembling throat, snatched the rope on his shoulders, and said, "If their bellies are full, my family will be full! Spare me one cut"!</p>
<p>I finally couldn't bear to look at this tragedy; and the officer roared like a tiger, "Go away! What are you looking at"? But I think I can vaguely understand these fragments, in Chinese territory, Chinese people can't do business? It's common for Chinese people to bully each other in China, but it's strange to say foreign territory in his mouth! Who said the city is civilized? It's simply a beast that doesn't understand humanity!</p>

<p>— Xianweisheng</p>
<p>The night before last, after dinner, I was idle and had nothing to do, so I went to the streets with Zhou Zihuan Yu and Xu Zibojian. While talking and walking, when we walked close to Linping Road in Hongkou, we saw a very large red and green "cloth windshield" in front of a north-facing shop, shaking in the wind.</p>
<p>Looking closer, it was a "Huguan Noodle Shop". How strange! The "cloth windshield" was made of the "national flag". The "Blue Sky" and "White Sun" were also complete, and the "Red Earth" was not missing at all, but the color was slightly darker.</p>
<p>I didn't see it, but when I saw it, I was heartbroken! Because I thought of how much foreigners "respect" the "national flag"? In the movies, sometimes when they encounter the national flag, they stand up to "salute". We Chinese people, not to mention saluting the national flag, are now using it as a windshield. Foreigners are afraid of laughing secretly behind their backs when they see it.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Notes on What I Saw: "Yi Ya Reborn" <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Banleng</p>
<p>A tooth-setting shop outside the South Gate of Dinghai hangs a sign that says: "Yi Ya Reborn". Note: Yi Ya was a temple person of Duke Huan of Qi in the Spring and Autumn Period. He was favored for his cooking taste. There is a saying: "Duke Huan of Qi was not happy in the middle of the night, and Yi Ya fried and grilled and presented it, and Duke Huan ate it and was full." Now, calling a tooth-setting person "Yi Ya Reborn" is a literal translation that makes people laugh when they see it.</p>

<p>— Wang Shapa</p>
<p>Every time I stroll along the road, I often see the laborers on cargo trucks teasing women walking along the streets, either spitting or throwing mud, taking advantage of their lack of preparedness to commit mischief at will. If you try to reason with them, their truck has already driven far away.</p>
<p>Today, while returning home from buying things on the street, I passed Jisi Feier Road. Near the entrance of the zoo in Fanwangdu Park, I saw a cargo truck loaded with bricks pass by. The laborers on the truck were grinning and said to two girls walking along the street, "Hey! Sister, I'll come to your house at night!" But the two girls just lowered their heads and didn't say anything.</p>
<p>I thought to myself: These laborers' actions, whether spitting, throwing mud, or saying vulgar words, are ultimately a manifestation of the lack of education and knowledge among our Chinese people due to the lack of universal education.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Record of Observations: A Compromise <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Kou</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, because I didn't have any homework, I took the opportunity to go to the Peiping Library. After taking a seat, I routinely looked around. As a result, I saw an old man sitting by the window, about sixty years old, wearing a long gown and mandarin jacket, with thick glasses. In front of him was a thread-bound woodblock book, and he was concentrating on reading it. Sitting next to him was a young woman, lightly powdered, wearing a fur coat, exuding a modern aura. In front of her was a foreign original book, and she was also reading it with great interest. The disharmonious situation between the two of them seemed to symbolize something about to happen.</p>
<p>In the first few minutes, everyone was at peace. Later, the young woman suddenly left her seat and walked straight to the window, opening the closed window with a bang. Although she didn't announce the reason for opening the window, I guessed that it was probably because she was wearing too warm clothes and wanted to cool off with the wind, or because the air in the room was not fresh enough and she wanted to open the window to change the air. In short, no matter what her reason for opening the window was, as soon as the window was opened, the cold wind immediately rushed in from the window. The old man began to shiver, and his concentration on reading could no longer be maintained. So he slowly got up and closed the window. His reason for closing the window was obviously because he was afraid of the cold. When the young woman sitting next to him saw this, she immediately stood up, walked to the window, and opened the window again. Judging from the expression on her face, she was a little angry, as if to say, "You old fellow, how dare you oppose me!" When the old man saw that the window was open again, obviously conflicting with his own interests too seriously, he couldn't help but feel angry, so he closed the window again, showing that the weak also have the spirit of resistance. When the young woman saw this, she immediately stood up, walked to the window, and slammed the window open again. Her steps were heavier than before, and her actions were more violent, obviously angry. When the old man saw this, he didn't show weakness either, and immediately closed the window with a thud, showing the spirit of being old but vigorous. When the young woman saw this, she was simply furious, and immediately opened the window again. When the old man saw this, he got up and closed it again. This opening and closing continued, but what was strange was that although the expressions on their faces showed that they were irreconcilable, they remained silent and quietly continued their work of opening and closing. I watched from the side and couldn't help but find it funny, but for my own benefit, I wanted to stand on the old man's side and join the battle. But then I thought, the old man wants to close the window because he is afraid of the cold, and it would be too ridiculous for someone as young as me to be afraid of the cold. As a result, I adopted a neutral attitude. Their work of opening and closing continued. If it weren't for the librarian to mediate, I'm afraid it would still be going on. Because neither side would give in, the librarian found it difficult to mediate. Later, he proposed a compromise: "The window should be half-open and half-closed." A storm was finally stopped. But the cold wind continued to come in from the half-open window, and the old man continued to shiver. The readers who had no vested interests watched from the sidelines from beginning to end, and no one was willing to express a fair opinion. So I couldn't help but sigh and say, "With compromise, the weak always suffer."</p>
<h3 id="e222">Record of Observations: Loss <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhong</p>
<p>When things are lost, what is lost must be objects, and they must be things that are carried around, such as pens, books, wallets, watches, handkerchiefs, etc. If these things are lost while they are placed somewhere, then it is theft, and it cannot be called a loss. If an animal is lost and it is called a loss, that's a joke!</p>
<p>On Jiayu Road, I saw a red-paper "Looking for a Horse" advertisement posted on a utility pole, saying that a horse was lost. I felt that the gentleman who wrote the advertisement must not have a very clear understanding of literature, so he couldn't distinguish between "loss" and going missing. Unexpectedly, coincidentally, on the 6th, a Shanghai newspaper had a headline in the news: "Li Zibin is Looking for a Lost Girl." I don't know if Mr. Li's girl is made of stone or wood, lost in a pocket? Or lost with other things under his arm? If it is a living animal, then it is either missing or abducted. Calling it a loss doesn't seem quite right!</p>

<h3 id="e223">Finance: Foreign Exchange Excessively Loose, Many Parties Crowded, Gold Price Falls Another Seven Yuan Four, Sudden Rebound After Closing, Chips Reached 14,000 <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was even weaker yesterday, almost approaching the 50 yuan mark, with a final rebound. There were many rumors of negative news in the foreign exchange market, causing Chinese merchants to dump. The foreign exchange market was excessively loose, and the market was filled with selling pressure, making it impossible for the multiple parties to rally, resulting in this situation. It is said that according to early reports, the falling trend of silver prices in the UK and US from overseas has stopped, and has suddenly rebounded. It is said that India and outsiders are buying, short covering, lacking any supply, the number of sellers is small, and the US has not bought at this price, the market is stable, and after the close there are a few buyers manipulating the listed price, and the supply is still scarce. Although the New York silver market is flat, the forward silver price in Monterrey still rose by 7.5 to 2.5 cents. Foreign exchange rose slightly. The price of raw gold in London fell by one penny, making it difficult to boost confidence. Off-market trading opened at 59 yuan, with major players such as Fuxing Yong selling heavily, and Shenfeng and others also selling, reducing the price to 55 yuan. However, there were many buyers who wanted to buy at the limit price, which was able to provide support. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the pound and US dollar both flat, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The listed price of standard bullion fell to 1,146 yuan and 6 jiao, stabilizing confidence. After opening, it showed stability, with active buying, and once rebounded. Banks slightly resisted, hindering the rise. There were rumors that a certain bank would ship a large amount of cash next Monday, and Chinese merchants scrambled to sell foreign exchange, resulting in more fees in the market. Major players competed to sell, gradually moving downstream, but because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices for the pound and US dollar were both flat, and banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply, there was a lot of fluctuation after the decline. The Silver Balance Tax announcement was up 75. After that, there was a slight improvement, but the rise was temporary, and it soon weakened again. The foreign exchange market continued to strengthen, major players jointly supplied, and many parties closed their positions, falling to 5 yuan. However, major players maintained the price at a low level, and the situation fluctuated at noon.

<h3 id="e236">The Chinese Tea Industry (3) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Baiyi</p>
<p>Java was originally a market for Chinese tea, as mentioned earlier. However, in 1934, the export of Chinese tea to the islands of Java and Madura was only 82,580 kilograms, worth only 89,124 guilders. During the same period, the import of Japanese and Taiwanese tea to Java reached 1,449,051 kilograms, worth 1,452,201 guilders, far exceeding the export of Chinese tea to Java. In 1933, Chinese tea exports to Java were still 210,000 kilograms, worth 230,000 guilders, but in just one year, there was a sharp decrease of about two-thirds. The main reason for the rapid decline in Chinese tea exports to Java is the sharp increase in tea production in Java itself, but the large-scale import of Japanese and Taiwanese tea indicates that there are other factors involved. What are these factors? The exchange rate.</p>
<p>North Africa was originally a market for Chinese green tea, but since 1930, it has also been penetrated by Japanese green tea. In 1928, the Central Association of Japanese Tea Industry Organizations, in order to develop the sales channels for green tea, sent Mr. Sakuku Torii to the Philippines to promote it. In 1929, there was an export of 1,098 pounds, but this was only for samples. The following year, exports increased to 14,000 pounds. By 1931, exports increased sharply to 4,180,000 pounds. In 1932, the increase was even greater, reaching 11,650,000 pounds. In 1932, the increase was about 25 times greater than in 1931. The methods used by Japan are worth noting. When Japan exported green tea to Morocco in 1910, its quality was far inferior to Chinese tea and did not meet the needs of the local market. Therefore, it was often mixed with about three-sevenths or four-sixths of Chinese tea and sold under Chinese tea names. However, in the following year, due to improvements in its form and quality, Japanese green tea was able to develop independently. That year, it accounted for 20% of the total import volume in Morocco. At the same time, its price was lower than that of Chinese tea, with each pound being one to ten pence cheaper. The above is the direct reason for the loss and narrowing of the Chinese tea market.</p>
<p>4. The Technological Backwardness of the Chinese Tea Industry</p>
<p>The competition between emerging tea-producing countries and China has been described above. However, due to its geographical location, the quality of Chinese tea is the best in the world. Why is it that it is not as good as the later comers like Ceylon, Japan, India, and Java, and has been eroded in its traditional Chinese tea market? The reasons: First, the value of Chinese currency is controlled by the major world powers. At a time when currency inflation is widespread in the world, China's exchange rate has lost its balance, resulting in a general lack of improvement in foreign trade. Because China is on the silver standard, and the major world powers are on the gold standard, the silver used in China is regarded as a commodity in the gold standard countries. Therefore, when the price of gold increases, the price of silver decreases, and vice versa. The major world powers, for their own sake, demand the development of export trade and implement currency devaluation policies. As a result, the price of silver increases, and the market price of Chinese exports overseas also increases, and their sales naturally gradually decrease. Second, the technology of Chinese tea production has not yet reached the stage of improvement. Most of them still use the handicraft method of production. Therefore, in terms of quantity, it cannot be proportional to the production of emerging tea-producing countries. In terms of quality, it mostly maintains its original state. At the same time, the bad habits of merchants have not been eliminated, such as adding water to the tea to increase its weight and dyeing the tea to deceive consumers.</p>
<p>The former reason is not a problem of the tea itself, so there is no need to explain it here. In the future, I only hope that the central government authorities will work hard to balance international exchange rates with political power. The latter reason is the real problem of the current tea industry. Because if the problem of tea itself can be solved, then Chinese tea still has the hope of making a comeback in the world market.</p>
<p>In order to understand the current situation of the Chinese tea-making industry, I will briefly describe the famous tea-making situations in various places as follows:</p>
<p>(Anhui) Anhui is the richest area in China for tea production. According to the survey of the Department of Industry and Commerce of the Baoye Department: the total tea production in the province in 1920 was 293,700 dan. The method of making Qimen black tea in Anhui Province does not take advantage of sunlight, so the withering and fermentation are not very good. Because the temperature is too high, when brewing with boiling water, there is often a sun odor. At the same time, in recent years, tea farmers in Anhui Province have lengthened tea buds to six or seven inches due to the poor market conditions, and picked the stems and leaves together, only seeking quantity and not quality. Also, the method of making green tea in Anhui Province is to stir-fry the green in an iron pot, or to expose it to sunlight, so its color and fragrance are not good. The Anhui Provincial Government has recently established a model tea farm in Huoshan, imitating the Japanese method of making green tea. Machine-made tea. However, most of Anhui Province still uses hand-made tea.</p>
<p>(Zhejiang) Tea is produced in 75 counties in Zhejiang. According to the report of the Zhejiang Construction Department, the annual tea production in Zhejiang Province is about 200,000 dan. However, the method of making tea in Zhejiang Province still follows the old method. That is, the newly picked tea leaves are stir-fried in a pot, and when about one-tenth of the moisture is dried, they are taken out and placed on a bamboo curtain, rounded by hand, and re-stir-fried or placed in a baking cage to bake, and it is done. The method of making the famous Zhejiang tea Longjing tea is also the same, but it is slightly more precise.</p>
<p>(Jiangxi) The tea-producing area in Jiangxi reaches more than 50 counties. Gan tea has a long history of being sold overseas. According to tea merchants, about 190,000 boxes of Gan Ning black tea and about 200,000 boxes of flower tea were exported every year during the 31st and 32nd years of Guangxu, with a total of about 500,000 boxes in the province. It can be seen its prosperity. Later, under the influence of competition from foreign teas such as Ceylon and Indian tea, it gradually declined and fell into a slump. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e237">Realism and Futurism <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Changming</p>
<p>Grasping reality and paying attention to the future are, in general, the correct philosophy of life for us, and should not be a problem. The problem is how to grasp reality and pay attention to the future, what reality should be grasped, and what future should be paid attention to. Moreover, if we can properly grasp and pay attention to reality and the future, then the two are not completely contradictory and incompatible.</p>
<p>Grasping reality means that people should pay attention to the objective state of affairs that has already become a reality or is becoming a reality, and should pay attention to the immediate and practical interests that have appeared or can appear in ourselves, and should not deviate from the objective reality and practical interests and fall into fantasy and disillusionment. Paying attention to the future means that people should pay attention to the changes in objective things, establish our long-term goals by predicting their inevitable development, continue to be guided by new ideals, and create our new lives, instead of simply sticking to current interests or living and acting blindly. Indeed, people live in reality, and even more so in the current environment composed of current realities. If we leave the natural and social material realities and completely disregard the current practical interests, we will immediately not be able to survive. However, people do not live today and do not need to continue living tomorrow. Striving for tomorrow's survival has the same meaning and importance as striving for today's survival. Therefore, in today's survival, we should not only consider today and forget tomorrow. In order to prepare for tomorrow's survival, and even to survive more happily than today, it is absolutely necessary to foresee the future and establish a new ideal and goal for the future, and even strive purposefully for the future and strive for a new and long-term future. Therefore, if we talk about realism based on striving for today's survival, and futurism based on striving for tomorrow's survival, both are legitimate philosophies of life. And because people live today and will continue to live tomorrow, and today we must lay the foundation for tomorrow's survival, it is very right to talk about both realism and futurism at the same time.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that all realism and futurism are correct and should be pursued. In fact, only realism that is based on the social and collective interests and does not abandon the ideal of moving towards a new life in the future, and futurism that can not be separated from the demands of the real world and striving for current survival, are worth adopting. In today's world, there are various incorrect tendencies in the pursuit of realism and futurism. In realism, some people pursue reality completely from the standpoint of individualism. As long as they can obtain benefits and power, that is, it is in their own realistic interests, they can disregard the interests of others, and even disregard the historical judgment of themselves in the future and the unfortunate fate that will eventually give them in the future, and blindly pursue their current gains. In addition, there are other people who just tell people to be content with their current lives and not to be dissatisfied with reality. As for the ideals of the future, in their view, they are absolutely empty fantasies. They only tell people to live blindly in history, so that everyone is completely isolated from the future. The former are individualistic and purely utilitarian realists, and the latter are conservative realists. But both of these are the same in that they are only satisfied with stopping at the pursuit of real life.</p>
<p>There is also an incorrect tendency towards the future. Some people completely abandon the pursuit of material life in the real world, and even leave the world of man, and only pursue the future or even the liberation of the soul after death. This is the futurism used by religious people to deceive and tempt the masses. Because they teach people to forget and endure all the pain of reality and oppose people's eagerness to fight for the improvement of real life. They believe that all happiness and rewards can be obtained in the future, in another future world after death: and the endurance of real pain is precisely the cause of creating good results in the future. This kind of futurism is a completely hopeless blank check, it only tells people to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>From the perspective of common sense, it seems that reality and the future are two contradictory extremes, but in fact they are not contradictory, but rather complementary and interdependent. Because without the satisfaction of reality, the survival of mankind would be fundamentally shaken, and there would be no way to talk about future survival. If you can't survive today, how can you talk about continuing to survive tomorrow? So to be able to survive tomorrow, and to be able to survive better tomorrow, it must be conditioned on today's survival. This means that the future must be based on reality, and the future cannot be separated from reality. On the contrary, if we survive now, we will continue to survive in the future, and we must be able to survive better. Then mankind will have the consciousness of progress, and be in line with the consciousness of satisfying mankind's desire to move upward. Otherwise, mankind's way of surviving tomorrow will still only remain at the stage of today's way of surviving, and even if we survive today, we will no longer be able to continue to survive tomorrow. These are not the lives of human beings. Today's survival is a preparation for tomorrow's survival, so in today's survival, we must pre-exist the new requirements for tomorrow's survival, and must take the purpose and ideal of continuing to survive tomorrow. So the future survival is the continuation of the real survival, and without the future, reality is also meaningless.</p>
<p>Therefore, the correct philosophy of life is that it can allow people to pursue realism, and also allow people to pursue futurism at the same time, and does not regard the two as absolutely contradictory and incompatible things. However, we must exclude that realism centered on individual utilitarianism, and realism that does not pay attention to the future at all and has no new ideals of the future, and we must also exclude the futurism of religious worldly thoughts that does not talk about reality at all, or only tells people to endure the pain of reality, does not think about improvement, and only entrusts its sweet dreams to the future. Because these are the reasons that hinder the collective interests of mankind's real life and the life philosophy of mankind's progress.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Silk Factory Apprentice <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changban</p>
<p>I attended a national primary school in the village when I was young, but because my family was poor, I could not enter the higher primary school. So I left the study and went to the mountains to herd cattle and sheep. But this life did not last long before my father sent me to a silk factory in the city to be an apprentice. At that time, it was the end of the European War (I found out later), and the silk industry was particularly developed. Five or six new ones had opened just in our county. Because the number of factories increased, there was a need for many reserve silk craftsmen--apprentices. So, advertisements were posted in the city and in various rural towns to recruit apprentices, and I was one of the many people who applied and were accepted at that time.</p>
<p>The silk factory I entered had a long history. Because of the development of business, it had undergone an expansion, so the scale was also very grand. It was considered to be the best in our city. Inside, there were a total of 400 silk reeling machines, and there were also more than 700 craftsmen and apprentices. The first day I went there, I was very happy when I suddenly saw such a large house. People who were used to living in huts in the countryside, once they arrived here, it was like ascending from hell to heaven. So, I followed my father to the "Management Office." The head of management was a short, middle-aged man. He asked my father for my name and age, and after completing the "guarantee" formalities, he said to me sternly, "The rules of the factory are very strict. You are new here, so you must be extra careful." He immediately ordered the administrator standing next to him, "Take him to the 'Cocoon Sorting Area'."</p>
<p>I followed the administrator out of the management office in fear and trembling, and I didn't dare to express anything when I said goodbye to my father.</p>
<p>In the cocoon sorting area, there were already several apprentices who had entered the factory before me. They were still doing this basic preliminary work. I learned from them for less than twenty minutes, and then I knew that "double-ended cocoons," "suppurated cocoons," "moth-shell cocoons," "maggot cocoons," and "stained cocoons" were all bad things that could not be reeled into silk. This work was very simple and easy. As long as your eyes were sharp and your fingers were quick, you could be a good cocoon sorter.</p>
<p>It was not easy to wait until the "Cocoon Market" closed (after the new cocoons were launched on the market, the silk factory bought them in large quantities. Among them, many bad cocoons had to be sorted out, and then woven and dried for storage), and then the cocoon sorting work was completed. Naturally, I also knew that the other work was not necessarily easier than this, but changing the taste would always make people feel excited. Later, the same administrator who was there before took me to the "Reeling Area." This job was nothing special either. It was just transferring the silk from the "small spools" to the "large spools" of the "Reeling Machine." The reeling machine was very heavy, and several strong apprentices took turns using hand-cranked, like me, a "little kid," you only needed to pay attention to the silk strips, don't let them retreat over the reels, or connect the ends. When the silk strips on the big spools reached a certain amount, then put them on the silk drying rack, dry them, and then send them to the "Packing Area," and then the work was</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>considered complete.</p>
<p>In the second year after I entered the factory, I was assigned to the "Silk Threading Area." This was considered to be the real contact with apprentice life. The silk threading area was divided into four areas: east, south, west, and north, arranged in a "口" shape. Each area had hundreds of silk reeling machines, and they were divided into four rows. Most of the silk threaders were craftsmen who had completed their apprenticeship, and a few were apprentices who were about to complete their apprenticeship. We little kids naturally did not have the qualification to "get on the machine." We could only serve five silk reeling machines for one person, helping the craftsmen to boil cocoons, change water, make fire, add charcoal, scoop out debris, or sweep the floor and send spools to the reeling area. It was really like a "stage extra" on the stage, throwing this away and changing that.</p>
<p>The factory stipulates that you have to get up at five o'clock every morning, but we always have to get up half an hour earlier to help the craftsmen boil the cocoons, add water to the silk pot, and make a fire. This way, we can win the craftsmen's favor, and at the same time, we can avoid being in a panic temporarily. Because the craftsmen make one or two more silk, they can get one or two more wages. If you delay his chance to make money, you will be scolded. The silk pot has to be changed three times a day, and each machine has to boil at least five portions of cocoons a day. At the same time, you have to add charcoal, scoop out debris, and send spools. The affairs of the five machines are all piled on one person, so we almost spend all day going back and forth between the machine rows, running from the silk reeling area to the cocoon boiling room, from the reeling area to the water storage pool. This craftsman is shouting, and that craftsman is shouting again. It is really very lively. At ten o'clock at night, the craftsmen clock out and go to bed, and we little apprentices still have to clean up the silk pots, sort out the debris, and sweep the floor. It will take at least half an hour before we can crawl into bed and sleep.</p>
<p>The place where we sleep is also called the "dormitory." Ten or more people sleep in the same room. To the left is the latrine, and to the right is connected to the "debris storage room." So, every summer season, plagues and diseases will be popular in the factory.</p>
<p>As for our meals, breakfast and lunch are both dry rice, and dinner is thin porridge. The so-called rice is white rice, but when you eat it, it has no rice taste, and it is so hard that you can't swallow it. At first, I didn't understand why this was. Later, I found out that the rice was soaked in lime water. This was a method devised by the kitchen in order to extract more profits and make people eat less rice.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Recent Global Oil Market <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Kuanren</p>
<p>Speaking solely from the perspective of market needs, the global oil market in recent years has indeed shown a slight increase in demand. The main reason for this is the increase in the production of automobiles, airplanes, and other industries in various countries. In fact, although the global automobile production volume continued to decrease in 1933, this decrease not only stopped in 1934, but also saw a significant increase. Although complete statistics for this year are not yet available, judging from the expansion of armaments in various countries and the automobile production situation in various countries in the past few months, it can be inferred that global automobile production is still increasing. According to statistics, the number of automobiles worldwide in 1934 was 34.9 million, an increase of 8% compared to 1933; also, the demand for gasoline in 1934 was 67.5 million tons, an increase of 6.9% compared to 1933.</p>
<p>According to the Berlin Business Cycle Research Institute, the registration index of newly manufactured light automobiles in the world's four major capitalist countries in the past two years is as follows:</p>
<p>1933 1934</p>
<p>United States 136.2 173.3</p>
<p>United Kingdom 119.7 148.3</p>
<p>France 108.1 111.5</p>
<p>Germany 199.5 318.4</p>
<p>(1932 == 100)</p>
<p>From this small table of statistics, it can also be seen that the automobile production of the world's four major capitalist countries has increased significantly in the past year. Among them, Germany has shown a surprising increase, which is naturally closely related to its efforts to expand armaments.</p>
<p>As for the increase in the number of airplanes in the world, it goes without saying that everyone is desperately expanding their air forces. However, since newspapers and magazines often have statistics on airplanes in various countries, we feel that there is no need to copy the statistics here again.</p>
<p>Logically, the increase in the production of automobiles and airplanes around the world, and the resulting increase in the demand for oil, should result in higher oil prices. However, the reality is the opposite of what is expected. Since last year, although the global demand for oil has increased with the increase in automobiles and airplanes, its price has shown a significant drop. According to what has been published this year, the prices of oil products worldwide in recent years are as follows:</p>
<p>Average Price (1929 == 100)</p>
<p>The sharp decline in global oil prices in recent years is clearly shown in this table. But what is the reason for the oil price drop? This is because: Firstly, the struggle among the world's trusts for the remaining oil resources and oil markets in the world is becoming increasingly acute. For example, in the struggle for Iraqi oil resources among the world's trusts last year, and in the struggle for Abyssinian oil resources among Britain, the United States, and Italy this year, ruthless and fierce struggles have been manifested. Also, the struggle between countries such as Britain and the United States for the world's oil market has also been developing at an accelerated pace in recent years. Secondly, the struggle for "oil independence" by general oil-consuming countries continues. This can be clearly seen in the efforts to develop domestic resources, the development of the oil refining industry, and the advancement of research into all substitutes in these oil-consuming countries in recent years. Thirdly, due to the general and extreme restrictions on imports and preparations for war in various countries around the world recently, the phenomenon of so-called "oil self-sufficiency" has shown a widespread development. As a result of these reasons, a contradictory phenomenon has emerged where oil production has increased but its market has shrunk, thus bringing about the scourge of the collapse of the world's oil market; and this scourge will not be alleviated by a slight increase in the objective need for oil.</p>
<p>Due to the collapse of the global oil market, it is natural that the strange phenomenon of overproduction of oil in the world will immediately arise. According to this year's statistics, the production and demand for oil worldwide in recent years show an extremely unbalanced situation of oversupply as follows:</p>
<p>The above table shows that both the production and demand for oil worldwide have increased significantly in recent years, but compared to each other, production exceeds demand, showing a clear phenomenon of overproduction.</p>
<p>The United States is the most developed place in the world's oil industry, but the situation of oil production exceeding demand in the United States is particularly serious. Last year, although there were restrictions under the Petroleum Industry Law in the United States, its oil production continued to increase. If the figures for the previous year and last year are combined, then the oil production in the United States exceeded demand by 18.5 million tons.</p>
<p>In addition to the United States, oil production in the world's major producing countries has also continued to increase in the past two years. Please see the following table (unit: million tons):</p>
<p>What is shown here can also prove that oil production in the world's major oil-producing countries is increasing rapidly recently. Such a large increase in production is certainly not something that a slight increase in demand can accommodate. Therefore, in recent years, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which has a special situation, almost all of the world's major oil-producing countries, led by the United States, have fallen into a crisis of oil overproduction.</p>
<p>Because of the collapse of the global oil market and the overproduction of oil in the world, the market prices of oil industry stocks on major stock exchanges around the world have fallen far below those before the panic (before 1929) in recent years. This can be seen from the following table of stock price indices of the oil industry on exchanges around the world: (1929 equals 100)</p>
<p>Last year, the stock prices of oil companies on exchanges everywhere were lower than those of the previous year. This fact fully demonstrates the pessimism in the world's oil industry and oil market.</p>
<p>However, the struggle among the world's trusts for oil resources and sales markets is only increasing. Under these circumstances, if the global oil market wants to improve, it is feared that it will only have to wait for the outbreak of a widespread global war, because at that time, the demand for oil will greatly increase, and the surplus oil production can be consumed in the war. Therefore, some people say that figures such as kerosene magnates are like military industrialists, and they very much hope that a brutal war will break out as soon as possible - this seems to have some reason.</p>
<p>Art World</p>
<h3 id="e240">On the Performance Method of Storytelling Drama <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Lichen</p>
<p>Drama, I am completely an outsider to this field. Especially to the old Chinese opera, not only can I not hum a single line, but I also watch it very rarely. Recently, at the invitation of a friend, I occasionally went to see an old opera, which also made me, an outsider, have some feelings about it, and I have some so-called opinions that I think it would be okay to bring up and talk about.</p>
<p>Drama, dance, and music are now all regarded as a kind of artistic entertainment, but these three have different characteristics. Because of this, in today's world where scientific classification has developed, they have all been divided into specialized subjects in art. In terms of their respective characteristics, drama is a more realistic art, because it concretely performs the words and actions of characters in a story, and even imitates the activities of characters in a story. Dance is different. It is much more abstract than drama. It uses a kind of physical movement to comprehensively express the overall appearance of a certain situation. Therefore, it does not have to focus on the detailed description of the activities and behaviors of characters in the process, but rather shortens and abstracts it into a symbolic concept that can be understood, and the performers express it through physical movements, and even directly express the performers' imagination or their own emotions. Therefore, although dance, like drama, uses physical movements to perform, drama expresses realistic facts and behavioral processes, while dance only expresses a conceptualized scene. For example, many dances of savage peoples, such as the war dances of the Negro and Indian tribes, simplify the facts of war and shorten them into a performance of a conceptualized scene. In the wedding dances and harvest dances of savage peoples, they imaginatively express the happiness of love, but do not necessarily perform a fixed real event and courtship actions, etc. The same is true of harvest dances, which only express the feeling of joy for a bountiful harvest, etc. As for music, it goes without saying. It is the expression of people's inner feelings and desires. Although it can sometimes embody a lively scene of a situation, such as when we hear the sound of a boatman's song, we seem to be able to vaguely think of the actions of those boatmen pulling the boat, thinking of them carrying heavy boat ropes, bending over, and moving forward step by step with great difficulty, and even thinking of the various real scenes of them coming from far away and then going from near to far, until they cannot be seen, as if we were seeing it with our own eyes. But in any case, the realistic scenes expressed by music are embodied by the revelation of inner feelings to the external situation, while dance and drama embody inner feelings through external actions. Because of this, the characteristics of these three things are different, and modern genuine art, therefore, makes them independent, developing them according to their respective characteristics, so that they can become more scientific and more artistic arts.</p>
<p>Chinese old opera is clearly a combination of these three things. It has movements and declarative performances, which means that its performance adopts a realistic descriptive method. It realistically performs the actions and words of the characters in the story, imitates the behavior and language of the characters in the story, and even concretely and in detail describes its facts, which includes the components of pure dramatic essence. However, when describing the behavior of characters in a story with physical movements, it is not limited to the realistic activities of the characters, but mixes it with the performance of abstract and intentional movements. Therefore, the audience also has to understand the characters' personality, thoughts, etc. from the form of physical performance. This means that Chinese old opera expresses the characters' personality, thoughts, behavior, etc. in the story with conceptualized scenes, rather than performing the realistic actions of the characters in the story. Therefore, this includes the performance method of dance essence. This is also the case in reality. Whether it is sheng, dan, chou, or mo, their activities on the stage are mostly done in the form of dancing. For example, when a wusheng or a black-faced character comes on stage, there is always a lot of jumping and dancing, which is used to express their strength and power, and their strong and mighty nature. Even in their actions, their steps and walking postures have a dancing color, because in fact, ordinary people never dance randomly or walk in that way. As for Chinese old opera, its language is mainly based on songs, and dialogues account for very little in the whole play, which is not a regular dramatic performance method. In terms of language, it is not realistic in describing things, because in real life, where is there the matter of singing words as songs? The lyrics, songs, and tones sung by the performers in old opera do not focus on using language to describe the real words of the characters in the play, but on using the tones of music to embody the full shape of the characters' personalities and their inner emotions. For example, the tone of Qingyi is deliberately made particularly gentle, humble, and timid. This not only shows the weakness and tenderness of women from her voice, but also fully shows how women under the rule of feudal society are oppressed into gentle and docile weaklings, becoming men's playthings and tame sheep.</p>
<p>From all these perspectives, Chinese old opera has too many symbolic elements, so everyone says it is symbolist. In fact, this kind of drama cannot be simply called drama, but is a mixture of drama, dance, and music. This kind of drama, if it is for the purpose of making drama, dance, and even music specialized and scientific, is not very suitable. Because drama focuses on realism, then changing the realistic behavior and actions into the way of dancing, and changing the declaration of language into the way of music, makes it not easy to be realistic and make drama progress. For example, if this play wants to perform an assassin assassinating, it should be done with witty and agile actions in order to show the realistic situation of urgency, wit, and panic, and it can also be vivid and touching. But the old opera comes up with a set of dancing and random dancing, and the content of tension, wit, and agility is completely obscured. How can this make that scene colorful? Also, in the performance of dialogues, some originally contain profound principles, or vicious and deep conversations, which must be expressed in language. Now you change it into singing to each other, and it is very difficult to express the real situation of deep, tight, vicious dialogues or debates. From the experience of the use of Chinese vernacular in recent years, it has been proven that even using classical Chinese is not easy to express some philosophical and scientific sentences, let alone wanting to use singing-style sentences to express the dialogues of the characters in the play. As for the timely relaxation, high and low intonation, etc. in the conversation, it is even more difficult to express in songs. Therefore, the use of songs in Chinese opera in the expression of statements only has a part of the meaning of musical beauty, and cannot realistically express the real situation of the characters' words and the wonderful plot, which also makes it difficult for it to complete its dramatic task and achieve scientificization.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that drama cannot be mixed with dance and music at all. I think that the difficulty of drama with dance and music also lies in inserting it into the realism of drama. That is to say, use it only when there is dancing and singing in the dramatic story. If there is not, then all performances should realistically perform the possible actions and language of the characters in the story, so that the drama can be scientific and become a specialized and pure drama.</p>
<p>Chinese old opera also has a major shortcoming, which is the issue of musical instruments. This is not only too noisy, but also not realistic, and can even disrupt people from concentrating on understanding the plot. The musical value of these kinds of musical instruments is originally very low. The reason why Chinese opera cannot abolish it is probably related to its mixed use of dance performance methods. Because it has to use the rhythm of drums and gongs to regulate and restrain the postures and techniques of dance, and even the syllables of singing, etc. The so-called "catching gongs" is usually the reason for this. Therefore, to abolish musical instruments, I am afraid that it is necessary to start with changing the performance method of dancing.</p>
<p>Chinese old opera is very primitive. When it comes to its content, it is of course entirely a product of feudal consciousness. As for the background of the production of this kind of drama, and how much use its symbolic characteristics of performance methods have, etc., are also worthy of discussion, but there is not much space to discuss this, so I will leave it to talk about it when there is a chance in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e241">On National Salvation <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Junshi</p>
<p>The internal affairs and diplomacy of any country are entrusted to its government. A government has its own certain policies. The people authorize the government, and the government should exert its abilities to strive for independence and survival for the nation and the country. If it does not betray the heavy trust of the people, the people must not go back and hinder the government's policy implementation steps.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, China, beset by internal and external troubles, is being forced to the brink. The national situation is precarious to the extreme. Recently, due to the autonomy movement in North China, there is a dangerous sign of breaking away from the central government. The universities in Peiping first made the determination to give their "last lesson," and then carried out a vigorous patriotic movement. The young students shouted for justice and expressed the public opinion in one ten-thousandth of the population. Their actions are commendable, praiseworthy, and admirable, and are no less than the May Fourth Movement. However, in a country's politics, if the government cannot fully exert its abilities and needs young students to intervene, causing them to distract from their studies and waste their precious time, it is really an extremely unfortunate thing! And in China, this kind of unfortunate thing happens one after another, which is the greatest misfortune among misfortunes!</p>
<p>Following the large-scale demonstrations in the universities of Peiping and Tientsin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places have also reportedly followed suit. These passionate actions of strikes, parades, slogans, posters, etc., in extraordinary times, naturally have their own significant meaning in arousing a huge wave in the hearts of the majority of people. But it is pitiful that since the beginning of the Republic of China, there have been too many opportunities to adopt this kind of action, and after too many opportunities, it is still the same old strikes, parades, slogans, and posters. I wonder when and on what day our dying China will be able to make these unarmed masses forever abandon this kind of action and not use it?</p>
<p>Suppose that the first time we decided to shout slogans was after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, then sixty years have passed, and we have been preparing and strengthening ourselves until now. What is still impossible to do? And suppose that the next time we decided to shout slogans was twenty years ago during the period when Yuan Shikai usurped national power, then ten years of education and ten years of recuperation should have made anything possible. And suppose that after the Northern Expedition, we really all shouted slogans of awakening, then seven or eight years of long years, why is national defense in a state of disarray and not even one hundredth of the things undone? Afterwards, the Jinan Incident, the loss of the Northeast, and the fall of Rehe Province, the times gave us deep and huge painful bites, but what could be summoned to national affairs besides the young students' patriotic enthusiasm? Thinking of this, I can't help but tear my heart and bleed, and I don't know where the tears should come from!</p>
<p>When we examine the past, we should have a deeper understanding of the national salvation movement. As mentioned above, demonstrations and parades are sufficient to show where the true public opinion of our country lies under extraordinary circumstances, sufficient to correct the vision and hearing of the world, and chill the hearts of traitors. Their intentions are good, but at the same time, we should also pay attention to how to strengthen the strength of national salvation to arm our bodies and arm our spirits:</p>
<p>1. National salvation should be listed as a constant belief. The overall plan for national salvation must be handled calmly, and it can never be achieved with the efforts of one morning or evening. In the past, King Goujian of Yue relied on his constant belief in lying on firewood and tasting gall, and finally achieved the goal of defeating Wu. If we want to talk about saving the country today, we must save the country every day, every moment, and every second; studying is for saving the country, working is for saving the country, speaking is for saving the country, saving the country at all times, saving the country in all things, and saving the country is our only belief. Only in this way can we gather absolutely great strength and truly show the practical effectiveness of saving the country.</p>
<p>2. National salvation should strengthen the overall strength of the country. The coming war is a scientific war, a war of knowledge, and a war in which the entire nation fights against the enemy. Today, our country's science is not as good as others, the people's knowledge is not as good as others, and the overall national strength is not as good as others. Therefore, from now on, we should engage in strengthening the country's strength on the one hand, and hold the determination to wait for the dawn, preparing to go to the national crisis together.</p>
<p>3. Young students should arm their minds as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The rise of national salvation movements in various places recently has made China and foreign countries know that our people's hearts have not died, and that the torch of national liberation is about to become a prairie fire. But because of this, there will inevitably be a small number of young students who are future national talents who will be sacrificed in vain under iron bars and stab wounds. On the one hand, it makes us admire their spirit of sacrifice, but on the other hand, when we think of the sentence "He died before he could finish his task," we can't help but feel infinite sorrow! Therefore, I think that in addition to demonstrations and parades, we should turn to the masses to awaken them from their sleeping nightmares. We should arm our own brains, be calm, work hard, until the nation is liberated!</p>
<p>Talking about the issue of national salvation has long been heartbreaking, and it is even more difficult for the Chinese people in the current situation to talk about the issue of national salvation. In the above respects, I am willing to seek the common understanding of the people of the country with the greatest sincerity!</p>

<h3 id="e242">Talking About "Worldliness" <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Weiren</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, I used to quarrel with my little companions for some reason, felt wronged, and even started fighting, scratching bloody marks on my face and swelling up a big blue mark on my leg. From then on, I broke off contact with my little companions and did not interact with them.</p>
<p>Years later, recalling the situation when I was young, I often find myself laughing.</p>
<p>Now, I have been in this society for five or six years, and I know that my temperament is very different from before. My previous stubbornness, arrogance, aloofness, and arrogant attitude have been melted away a lot by the great furnace of society. This may be a good thing, because now when I occasionally return to my hometown, the older elders will unanimously praise me and say: "This child knows the times!"</p>
<p>Worldliness is the key to living in the world. As the saying goes: "If you don't know how to read, you can still eat; if you don't know the sky and don't know people, it will be difficult to eat!" Indeed, indeed.</p>
<p>Generally, to know people, you must "observe their expressions"; to know the sky, you must "be good at discerning cold and warmth."</p>
<p>Therefore, a worldly woman, if she has flesh to sell, must sell flesh; a worldly man may as well sell his soul. To put it plainly, as long as there is wealth and glory, it is not impossible to be a running dog. They will always think this way: What is the purpose of life? Whoever doesn't become a slave is just a "bumpkin" as Shanghainese say. As long as gold, silver, and jewelry are in hand, a new Ford car from 1936 can be ridden, a marble-built foreign house can be lived in, and new French cuisine on the Atlantic coast can be enjoyed. It doesn't matter if you are a concubine or a plaything!</p>
<p>In short, whoever doesn't understand that this is the sharp new era of the 20th century and stubbornly clings to loyalty, chastity, integrity, and righteousness is a living zombie that is too pedantic and too corrupt!</p>
<p>Or, whoever harbors hatred for the fat businessman who ruined your chastity, or who scolds the master who deprived you of your freedom, and is preoccupied with revenge, is even more ignorant of "worldliness."</p>
<p>Today's smartest people want: yesterday's "enemy" can become "friend" today. Yesterday he was the one who cut your flesh, today you may as well carry thorns and ask him for forgiveness, and even if he slapped your right cheek, you may as well give him your left cheek. When we see them "raising champagne," they drink it all in one gulp, and then they are as friendly as ever and smile at each other. Isn't there a sense of "humor" here?</p>
<p>Some people who don't see through the true meaning of worldliness often think that worldly affairs are too childish and human affairs are too ridiculous when they see similar things. But what else is there in worldly affairs besides childishness? What else is there in human affairs besides ridiculousness? Two gentlemen meet on the street, shake hands with each other, "The weather today hahaha," aren't these ridiculous, aren't these childish? Therefore, the superior person: "How can a person not know worldliness?"</p>
<p>Recently, my compassionate and humanitarian thoughts often inspire my grand ambition to save the world; I want to go and save those sentient beings who are busy and ignorant of worldliness. Because I deeply believe in the truth of "Those who obey Heaven prosper, and those who defy Heaven perish." If a good head is not used to obey Heaven, then why bother to be a head?</p>
<p>Alas! The so-called worldliness and human relations in the world have not yet been believed by the vast number of sentient beings, which is also very sad.</p>

<p>— Pu Yu</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't dawdle. It's not like I want your money. Think about it yourself: the case is so serious!"</p>
<p>"Director Liu, I am an innocent person! Please have mercy; today I'll scrape together twenty yuan for travel expenses, and then give you a grace period of five days to send a hundred yuan to the bureau. -- I'll have to borrow! But..."</p>
<p>Damn! After a day of effort, getting "twenty yuan" is a joke, isn't it? What use is a hundred yuan of debt? It would be different if it were a large sum.</p>
<p>"Boss Li. I don't like to make empty promises; if you are willing to settle this case, quickly come up with two hundred yuan in cash now, and the remaining two hundred can be delayed for three days, but you have to issue a promissory note."</p>
<p>"Even if you kill me, I can't come up with that amount!"</p>
<p>"Then what are you going to do? -- Not a single yuan can be less!" I felt that I couldn't back down any further, this momentum must be firm.</p>
<p>"Me?..." The old man sighed deeply, and sat sadly on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Outside it was already dusk, and a kerosene lamp had been lit in the room. At this time, I was both angry and flustered: not a single penny had been received, and the old man's firm stubbornness really left me helpless. So I decided to take a tough approach and give him one last squeeze.</p>
<p>"Okay!" I ordered Jiang Xiwu pointedly, "Get the sealing strips out, let's do this officially!" As soon as I finished speaking, I stepped to the account table, pretending to take the account book. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>There is a very good cover on this issue of "Public Life": a bare-handed student is being beaten by two soldiers, and a smiling foreigner is standing beside them. What a heartbreaking and tragic event!</p>
<p>However, where are our newsreel cameras?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about Gongping, it's too far away; Shanghai, isn't there also a booming student movement for national salvation? However, where are our cameras?</p>
<p>Or, we can say that filming newsreels is the idea of the bosses. But! What kind of expressions do our employees have? Not even a single declaration!</p>
<p>If there was a newsreel about this student movement for national salvation being shown publicly in Shanghai, I don't believe it wouldn't sell out for three days!</p>
<p>However, there is not a single company in all of China that films newsreels, or if there is, it's just some "official" news.</p>
<p>Without talking about justice or heroism, let's just talk about it from a "business perspective," isn't this a pretty good subject?</p>
<p>Unless, our film industry is truly impoverished and out of its mind.</p>
<p>If that's really the case, then being poor is their own fault!</p>
