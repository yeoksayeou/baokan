<p>時評</p>
<h3>東菲風雲中之世界經濟</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>意阿事件。亦世界經濟上之重大事件也。意欲獲得阿國之資源。不惜出於一戰。然「隹兵不祥。」意國經濟已因備戰之故。大受影饗現金逃亡。外幣减小。債券及鈔票之流通額日見膨脹。設一旦開釁。戰事延長。卽有所獲。難償所失意雖拒絕國聯之建議。而和平之門猶未盡闔者。殆亦有鑒於斯歟。</p>
<p>再就其他言之英國固尙努力於弭戰。設終不能挽回墨索里尼之雄心。勢將首先捲入戰爭之漩渦。倫敦市塲。折日美金高漲。英鎊逃避。推其原因。實受地中海布防之影響耳。美國雖决意宣吿中立。但在如此錯綜複雜之經濟狀况下。稍一不愼。卽有重蹈歐戰覆轍之可能。是以美國商人對意阿風雲。至爲敏感如紐約市塲。五金鋼鐵軍用各股。巳無不漲。美棉亦曾一度上騰。殆因商人慮及埃印棉將受戰事損害之故。此外凡與軍事有關者。無不呈活躍之象。「矢人恐不傷人。函人惟恐傷人。」今日之工商業。正有如此情形也。</p>
<p>日本在歐戰之際。利用時會。大有所獲。即就會社資本一項而論。一九一四年僅有二十萬萬圓至一九二二年一躍而突破一百萬萬圓。此次意阿事起。日本工商界挾其豐富之經騐。又　作精密之規劃。以圖收漁翁之利。　花股票匯兌保險軍用各業。無不著著準備。甚至如草鞋商人。亦思向慣於赤足之阿人。推銷其貨品。日人之商業經營。能巨細不捐。全體一致。以謀對外發展。遇有機會。不肯輕易放過。此其所以能成功歟。</p>
<p>我中國商人。見意阿戰事之醞釀。亦羣起投機。若標金證劵紗花粉麥市況。兎起鶻落。頗極一時之盛。設戰禍不幸而發生。在此嚴重之經濟形勢卜。吾人如何以求自處。恐非此輩醉心於投機者之所慮及。彼等僅想乘機發一橫財而巳。夫以「隔岸觀火」爲可樂。而不念「燕巢危慕」之可懼。此實事之最可痛心者。吾商人於打算本身利益之際。盍亦念及對於民族之責任乎。</p>
<h3>最後排解已失敗　國聯處境極困難　特委會與意接洽無結果　賴伐爾氏表示堅决態度　雨季終意阿不免一戰乎</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）五國特委會不能告成意阿爭議之和平解决、已使國聯處於極困難之地位、國聯今唯能於下述二途擇一行之</p>
<p>（一）放棄國聯之原則、任令意國行其所欲爲、</p>
<p>（二）擁　國聯盟約而任意國退出國聯、</p>
<p>國聯選擇於此二者之中、殊爲不易、但當然將視衆議以决之也、五國特委會昨晨集議研究意阿對該會建議之覆文後、其主席瑪達里亞迦曾往訪意總代表阿樂錫、但談話未有結果、據國聯中人聲稱、昨晨特委會集議時、賴伐爾之熊度甚堅决、某旁聽員謂、賴氏之發言以擁護國聯盟約爲立塲、實勝於以法外長爲立塲也、瑪達里亞迦訪阿洛錫時，阿氏所向申述之言論、本可於昨夜發表、後因文詞須略加修正、乃决議展至今日、</p>
<p>五國特委會草擬致國聯行政院之調解失敗報吿書或需兩日以成之、此項報吿書提出後、行政院將命現在之特委會或更大之委員會製定將來進行手續之建議、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國觀察時局者鑒於阿國雨季之終了、及意國使五國特委會不復能進行其工作之强硬態度、今日抱一種見解、以爲意阿　終不可免之戰爭、其時期不久將屆駐意英大使德魯蒙代表英外相昨夜與意相墨索里尼之談話、是否爲翰旋意阿危局之最後努力、　如若干方　所傳僅重申地中海英海軍活動並不含有對意施攻之意思、現尙未悉、惟聞五國特委會將確知意代表阿洛錫對特委會主席瑪達里亞迦而發之言諭、實係正式最後之性質後、卽已拋棄其設法調解意阿爭之使命阿洛錫反對特委會建議之言論、至爲　烈、英代表艾登初不信其爲正式性質、迨後知意政府之意見、確如阿洛錫所言、特委會遂不復作調解之希望矣、英內閣定今日舉行八月二十二日以後之第一次令體會議、泰晤士報評論此事、謂與其今日任令擁謎盟約之努力歸於失敗不若昔日不擁護盟　之爲愈、致力和平者所欲用調和方法或拒暴决心而獲之實際、苟犧牲之、以此謀取脫除困難之最容易而最廉値的途徑、則眞非想像所及云、時阿京路透特派訪員電吿阿國某著名醫學專家所發之談片、據其意見至少在一個月內戰事不能發生、因雨季終了後、熱病與虎列拉症卽繼之而起、其勢頗熾、蔓延多處非至十月底不能肅淸　意兵現已染患熱病云醫家雖有此說、然觀察時局者則不信阿國能再享一個月之和平、除非日內瓦和解新努力能迅速成功耳、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英大使携霍爾函　再訪墨所里尼　密談約一小時</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英外相霍爾以私函交由駐意大使德魯蒙爵士送致意相墨索里尼里今晚英大使往訪意相、談約一小時之久、無他人在側、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英大使德魯蒙昨夜曾向墨索里尼申明英國之政策毫無反意之傾嚮、惟該使並吿墨氏、英政府擬恪守國聯盟約下切實之約言云（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨晚英國駐意大使德　蒙面遞意相墨索里尼乏英外相霍爾私函、聞其性質爲增固英政府近所發表關於英國海軍行動之公報、路透社探悉、該函已獲墨氏友好之答覆、倫敦觀察家因　於英海軍行動之公報似已發出良好之效果、意報之評論、今日已較前謹愼、故皆爲滿意、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>意內閣宣布　並未提出對案　視情勢答覆國聯處置</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意內　今日舉行會議、考慮國　局及墨索里尼　夜與英大使德魯蒙話之內容、旋發表公報稱、意國對五國特委會之建議、僅口頭申明其不能接受之理由、並未提出對案、自　星期六日至今所發生之一切事情、已表明意政府之態度不能視　變異云、聞墨索里尼曾在　今日會議中說及時局有根據國聯盟約若干條文發展之可能性意政府將視情勢而答覆之云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>鮑爾溫首相　召集全體閣議　尙待各方消息作决</h3>
<p>（倫敦）首相鮑爾溫昨曾在唐寗街十號與主要閣員若千人會商、以爲今日舉行重要內閣全體會議考慮意阿爭執之準備、鮑於晨間與樞密院大臣麥唐納、財相張伯倫外相霍爾·內相西門等談話約一小時之久、會談之前、鮑與霍爾曾密談半小時、晚回復與閣員作第二次談話、歷時約九十分鐘、海陸空三國防部大臣均與曾、此外出席者、有外相霍爾·商相任錫曼內相西門·殖民部大臣馬爾康麥唐納、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日午後英內閣開全體會議但散會後未有公報發表、除艾登現留日內瓦外、全體閣員皆出席會議嚴守秘密、但知閣員檢討國際政局耳、開會照問僅歷一時三刻之久、可。英內閣尙待日內瓦之消息、或世界各都城之電訊、今日閣議殆未有重要　議何時續開　議並未决定、但閣員皆將留于倫敦、庶可隨時召集特會、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>五國委員會　報告書已牛骨成　即送國聯行政院討論</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院意阿爭端小組員會頃于今晨　行會議、歷時兩小時之久、迄止午十二時三十分始將報吿書擬定、其內容包括該委員會至九月六日成立以來、所作各項談判一切關係文件、卽將送請行政院提付討論、幷于本日午後公佈全文行政院在下星期四日、卽本月二十六日之前不致討論此項報告書綠行政院擬于開會之前、預先知悉英意兩國內閣本日舉行會議結果故也、國聯會人士相信、現行局勢、在下星期四日之前、絕少相當進展之望、行政院首要任務、乃在决定此後究當採取何項程序、負責人士以爲程序問題、尙屬次要目前所亟須注意者、乃在時局未來之發展、即戰爭威脅究當如何加以應付云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意阿爭　小組委員會提付行政院之報告書、已于今晨製成　行政院是否再行　託該委員會　草擬新建議案　日內卽當加　　定樂觀人十相信、該委員會所提出之報吿書、非必調解努力失敗之謂、悲觀人士、則以爲行政院在實際上卽將依據國聯會盟約第十五條各項規定、以處理意阿爭端　換言之意國若果遠反此條第六項所規定之義務則國　會卽當探取制裁手段云（二十四日哈瓦斯竄）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國五國　員會對於意相墨索里尼所提要求、今日已予拒絕、因此意阿爭端開始以來、意國之第一次妥協表示、已遭意外之白眼、國聯行政院大概將於星期二三開會、討論此項僵局、此間人士今日以爲五國委員會旣一致反　意國之要求、行政　大概亦不致再提他項辦法、　交界預料五國委員會將推舉小組委員會、參考國聯盟約第十五條、草擬報吿、國聯者實施該案、則意國之攻擊阿比西尼亞將完全爲侵略行動、當由會員國家實行制裁、阿國方面因阿皇　通知國，接受建、其地位已毫無問題矣、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯五國委員會已議决放棄一切　　之希望、主席西班牙代表瑪達里亞迦今日宣布、該會將於明日開會、草擬報吿、綜述意阿爭端之調解經過、並以第二步行動之靑任諉諸員國、據悉該委員會擬公佈此次爭　之一切文　、包括阿國接受該會建　之通知及意國之拒絕通知、一般人以爲該會此舉將　意國不得不負拒絕和解之責任云、五國員會旣放棄調解、則全部問題復須由行政院解决、槪行政院亦將公佈報吿、並提出和平之建議、倘阿國接受國聯之最後建議、而意國仍予拒絕、則以國聯論意國對阿作戰、卽屬違法根　國　盟約、所有會員國家皆當助阿、此問人士今日深覺意國如果實行開戰、各有殊有施行制裁之意、今日五國委員會開會之時、法國總理兼外長賴伐爾以英法兩國發言人之資格批評意國之熊度、此點大可注意、主席瑪氏曾問意國代表阿洛錫、意國星期日所提出之建議是否即爲意國最低之正式要求、據稱阿洛錫曾承認確係止式建議、惟彼是否曾言爲最低要求、則猶未詳、按阿洛錫之答語、如果屬實、則與羅馬外部發言人之聲明衝突、　羅馬方面否認意國曾對於五國委員會提出對案也、據阿京消息、阿國外部發言人曾稱曾意國倘有此項建議、則實屬「不可思議」、以意人而統制阿國軍隊、是誠可笑之尤者也云（二十三日國民社電）（右上）阿皇與后及其子女（左上）阿國之精銳騎兵（右下）阿女兵持槍作禦敵姿勢（左下）意相墨索里尼閱軍</p>
<h3>國聯行政院　明日再開會議　討論委員會報告書</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院將於星期四日考慮五國特委會之報吿書、特委會今日始完成其根據公文等草擬全盤時局報吿書之工作、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據哈瓦斯社外交訪員探悉、意阿爭站前途似十分黯淡、則以國　行政院對於意國已不能再有所讓步故也、行政院明日開會時、大約將聯取五國小組委員會關於和解程序失敗之報吿、並將</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>此項報吿書公佈、俾由世界與論加以判斷、至於國聯盟約第十五條內所載明之調解程序是否尙有採用之餘地、亦當由行政院决定之、但無論如何在意國實行進攻阿比西尼亞之前、則不能採用盟約第十六條關於制裁之規定、由是調解雖已遭失敗、但在意國向阿國開釁以前、尙有若干猶豫期間、外交家仍可乘此最後五分鐘之時機、以謀和平解决此間一般人之所希望者惟此而已、此外國聯會方面人士、又以爲五國小組委員會斷無繼續進行調解程序之餘地、蓋自巴黎三國會議以來、意國對於談判語調、縱略見緩和、而其根本態度、則未有變更、小組委員會苟不依照意國志願、則一切建議均不免　意國之拒斥也（廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>五國委員會　調解報告原文　在日內代發表共分五部</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）五國委員會建議之原文已於今日下午公布、內容共分五大部、第一部槪述當前之局勢及委員會工作之範圍、第二部載改造阿比西尼亞之若干建議、第三部詳述實施此項改造計畫之細則第四部及第五部提出解决爭執之具體建議原文第一部載稱、委員會設法覓求符合下列條件之談判基礎、　各委員國獨立與領土之完整、（二）各會員國間之親善關係、繼述阿比西尼亞出席國聯大會我表之演說、內稱、阿國願善意討論各種開發該國經濟政治及財政之建議、以符國聯盟約之精神、</p>

<p>（巴黎）據此間報紙所載、法國探詢英國將來對於若干歐洲國家破壞國聯盟約之態度、成爲艾登爵士與賴伐爾總理昨日談話之資料、二人特別考慮簽訂東歐公約及保障奧國獨立之問題、日報稱艾登曾吿知賴伐爾、謂英政府準備與法國簽訂多數公約、擔保英法兩國在歐洲方面繼續積極合作、艾登並稱、過去數年中、英國之外交政策、雖多錯誤、但最近之事變已使英國瞭解歐菲兩洲有實施集體保安制之必要、故英國準備負擔此方而之遠大義務云、（廿三日國民電）</p>

<h3>對於增加籌碼問題之竟建（四）</h3>
<p>五　金融制度之缺陷</p>
<p>支會付籌碼之喪失雖多、惟尙未至枯之境、上文已言之矣、然何以支付籌碼未至枯竭、而金融周轉、已極度艱難、此則不能不更歸咎於金融制度之缺陷、滬市十數年來、舊金融制度、逐漸崩潰、而新金融制度、尙未確立、金融流通之動態、僅爲無條理的抱注、而未能爲有系統的循環、平時銀根和緩、則投資放欵、各自爲政、各不相謀、而易陷於過度之信用擴張、一旦風波突起、又每輒張惶失措、嚴關緊鋼、而成爲不應有之信用緊縮、就目下情形而論、倘金融業能致提供其實力、市面恐慌、幾可旦夕緩和、然金融業之所以不能慨然出此、亦有其不得已之苦衷、其、則金融業向工商業通融之後、孰能冉爲金融業通融、倘後盾不具、則金融業一旦自身缺乏資金、非國家之福、吾人欲解决此二問題、則積極的必須健全金融組織、造成一偉大的金融中心勢力、以為金融業之後盾與金融周轉之樞紐、使金融組織之本身、先能系統的循環、消極的更須使此循環中之貨幣、不至因國際收支之不能適合而大量外流、必如是、金融業乃能完成其有機體的循環作用、而盡其在國民經濟體系中應有之任務、然欲達此目的、又非充分運用信用籌碼不爲功、其詳另見下文、</p>
<p>六　現代的信用籌碼</p>
<p>如上文所述、則信用籌碼之不善運用、實為當前金融體系中之最大缺陷、蓋支付籌碼、猶之動力、而信用籌碼則爲機械、無動力固不能運轉機械、而機械不充、亦惟有徒耗動力、而無裨生產、以故信用籌碼之運用、如不加以有力之推進、則吾人縱能輸入外資、甚至膨脹通貨、其結果亦徒助長投機與經濟上畸形之發展而已、</p>
<p>現代金融市場之信用籌碼、主要者凡二、一爲產業證券、股票及公司債票屬之、二爲票據、其通常者為銀行承滙票及商業承兌滙票、產業證券之發行及賣買、造成金融體系中之長期資金市塲、其代表機關、爲證券交易所、工商業者藉此以取得資本、一般人民藉此以投資產業、而公司概織下之大量生產事業、於是勃興、國民經濟乃能發達、票據之承兌及貼現、造成金融體系之短期資金市塲、分析言之、則爲承兌票據市及貼現市塲、前者爲銀行接受工商業者所提供之抵押成保證、代爲承兌其所發行之遠期滙票、是爲銀行承兌票據、是項票據、在市塲公開賣買、公定市價、是為承兌票據市塲、後者爲工商業者賒賣貨物、隨即發行遠期滙票、便賖購貨物之債務人爲之承兌、是爲商業承兌滙票、是項票據、向金硎業以貼現方式、取得通融、金硎爲之公定貼現率、酌爲貼現、是爲貼現市塲承兌票據市塲及貼現市塲之運用、工商業遂可以取得短期資金之通融、</p>
<p>金融體系中須有長期資金市塲及短期資金市塲、組織仍得稱爲健全、長期資金市塲須以股票及公司債爲主要籌碼、短期資金市塲須以銀行承兌滙票及商業承兌滙票爲主要籌碼、乃得謂爲具備現代金融市塲之必需條件、（未完）</p>

<h3>本市廣東游泳隊　對游泳預選提出疑問</h3>
<p>——聲請預選委員會補救——</p>
<p>溫敬令徐亨未曾入選</p>
<p>跳水預選請外人評判</p>
<p>本市廣東游泳隊、對全運本市游泳預選、提出疑問云、逕啟者、敝隊對於此次本市全運游泳預選、委任彭三美君主理一切、本早具熱誠愛戴、深為海上游泳界慶幸得人、惟自開始訓練至拔選結束止、其中經過情形、竟有背乎預選之原理、而引起敝隊隊員之不滿者、比比皆是、敝隊為維護隊員運動精神計、除已去函市府及上海全運預選委員會聲請補救外、茲復將其不當諸點、略陳於後、</p>
<p>按此次游泳隊之選派、係分速度與跳水兩種、前者之挑選方法、係自由報名、定期練習測騐各員成績、以為挑選之標準，其法至善、尤稱公允、然敝隊隊員溫君敬令游泳技術之精嫻、素著盛名、如最近代表中華出席上海國際游泳賽、亦以優美之成績表現於全市民衆之前、此次竟遭落選、誠出意料、査此次代表中、其成績大有遜於溫君者、敝隊深以為憾、或謂溫君不入選之原因、由於不能按日到塲練習、不知溫君肄業滬江大學、事實上勢難逐日往來跋踄、事前早經通知主持人、蓋以學業固不宜荒廢、而每日往返車資、為數亦復不少、（約三四元）以一莘莘學子、殊難負此巨大之損失、而彼在校中固亦可照常練習也、是以為上海運動事業計、為鼓勵好學運動員計、對於遺憾事件、似有以補救之必要、隊員徐亨、上屆曾代表本市出席全運、而上屆上海市於游泳所獲最名貴之一分、亦賴此君之力、方不致吃鴨蛋、核其平日成績、短程五十米常在三十秒以下、最近參加市府新池開幕表演三式接力游、第三程時其速度確超餘子、且較入選代表張榮光君為佳、當時張君得第二稈蛙式、獲勝之餘、而先徐入水、惟達終點、則與徐齊、此為萬目共見之事實自無待言、至於有責徐君未曾參加訓練、應不能入選者、更為不解、蓋此次預選早已聲言兼須視察平日成績、以作取捨標準、而徐君平日固為一優秀泳員、彼時更以隨征爪哇未返、致未能參加訓練、况上屆被選代表、原有出席之優先權、例諸本屆女網粱佩瑜、因病未參加預選賽、即被推為隊長、當可援引、且此次預選結束之後、彭君復於最近市府公開比賽中、三令五申、先誡於五百米賽員如成績達三十四分以內、尙可與以代表參加全運機會之獎勵、而於市池開幕日、目賭成績良好素負盛名之短稈健將如徐亨君者輕輕放過、不令其有一試之機會、此誠所費解者也、</p>
<p>至跳水組之挑選、經於十六晚在西靑池結束、此次選派事前旣無充分準備、由彭君一人主持、評判結果、尤為遺憾、</p>
<p>査此次比賽評判員事前旣未經公佈、臨時由彭君請西靑Bright君担任、當局對此重要事項、辦理草率乃爾、然則對批評之確定性如何、當可推想而知矣、</p>
<p>至花式跳水之方式、就評判員之批評、見仁見智、各具主覜之見解、旣就同一姿勢論、有以身軀雄偉為美妙、有以短小精榦為美觀、是以世界各各國之跳水比賽、多設三人以上以評判員所以集數方之意見、而為公正之判斷也、况評判員所站立之地位、與跳水者姿勢優劣之批評、亦有莫大之關聯、茲者祗設一人為評判、豈能盡窺全豹、是則已失評判之意義矣、</p>
<p>査近年我國歷次選派代表均由國人充任評判、而此次彭君竟垂靑於外人、其用意安在、雖不得而知、然言語不通、詞意不違、影響與賽員之成績、已不鮮矣、上海廣東游泳隊全體隊員一百五十人謹上、</p>

<h3>小男兒（五六）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>可憐的老黃花這幾天來心緖正惡劣，因為最近她喪失了她的小犢，不勝悲傷，因此她看一切人類盡是她的仇敵（誰也能責備她）？所以當那個「麥打屠」（註一）向她處騰躍而來，長槍尖端掛着一塊紅手帕一路乘風飛舞，她只仰起了頭，畏鳴了一聲「牟」！韜糜還是維糾糾朝着她處騎來，兎披見是他的老朋友，也很願走近些，可是當那長矛擲到她的背上砰然作聲，那時驢和牛都大吃一驚，心裏好生厭惡，兎披退走一步，長嘶一聲，表示同情的抗議，而黃花老牛經此一擊，低着她的兩角，不勝恨恨，</p>
<p>（註一）Matadore西班牙鬥牛的人。牛敗便將牛屠殺了。</p>
<p>「再打去，不要放她，韜摩；她正發了脾氣，就快來了！」唐恩喊着，他在後面搶來再是一棒，解客和內達也照樣做去。</p>
<p>老黃花得見她自己四面受困，被人非禮相待，便繞塲地疾走，祇覺得一刻不如一刻，到後夾竟如發狂一般，因為她走着任何方向，總有一個可怕的童子，口裏狂喊，手裏並亂舞着一種希奇而可惡的鞭子，他們以為這多有趣呀！然而眞够苦了她，直到她再也忍耐不住，忽以迅雷不及掩耳之舉，使全個局面突然起了個極大變化。她驀地掉轉身來，直向她的老朋友兎披一邊衝去，因為她眞痛恨他迫得太急了，可憐行動遲緩的兎披急急向後一退，身子立得不穩，被一塊石頭一絆，可憐人馬和一切都烏漆漆倒作一團，老黃花驚惶失措之餘，竟躍過牆垣，沿着路狂奔而去。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （王瑜）</p>
<p>拿東西去當的時候，希望當票上的錢數大；贖當的時候，希望當票上的錢數小。</p>
<p>上海有許多人是在當舖裏翻換一年四季的衣服。</p>
<p>一張過了期的當票，不知道染上了多少眼淚。</p>
<p>東西當在當舖裏，就好似一個人犯罪坐牢；滿了十八個月，就好似旣坐牢，結果還是遭受槍斃。</p>
<p>當舖原是救急的，但往往一個人因為所有東西當光，反而急死得快些了。</p>
<p>這年頭當舖是「止當候贖」，一般人是「止贖只當」，窮人是「沒有當也不能贖」。</p>
<p>富人才有資格開當舖，而當舖的櫃台都是很高，這就是吿訴我們窮人是「高攀不上」的。</p>
<h3>維他命X</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>且慢着誇口現在的科學進步，翳學昌明。愛克斯光，鐳錠，維他命ABCD，以及其他一切種種，似乎對於不拘甚麽疑難雜症，都可着手成春了，其實呢，對於現在所流行的一切精神病，除了眼瞧着病者，自已選服着「安眠藥，「來沙而」，「生雅片」等消極治療藥品之外，可還有甚麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>我這裏所說的精神病，聽着，並不是瘋人院所能治療的，非中外醫家所能望聞問切而識得的病症，自然，更非瓶裝，匣裝，或是紙包的藥片，藥粉或是藥汁，所能醫治的。——這種精神病的惟一病徵，便是唉聲嘆氣，甚麽都限於極度的消極與悲觀。病源可分為二種，一種是戀愛的失敗，一種是事業的失敗，或生活的困難。</p>
<p>對於這種精神病的惟一治療奇藥，說穿了，除了呆子之外，誰都知道的，便是白花花的大洋錢。但「白花花的大洋錢」，是不成其為藥名的，於是名之曰「維他命X」。例如失戀者，只要投以「維他命X」便不愁對手方不為征服。事業失敗者，服了維他命X，便不啻服了興奮劑？還愁不能重振旗鼓麽？</p>
<p>不過我雖有了這個造福人羣的偉大的發明，就因這種仙丹妙藥的成本太貴，不能着手配合，而同時却又不敢自秘，所以特地發表出來，或許世間有不少大富翁大善士，將贈送濟世。</p>
<p>請注意，在目前，黃河長江水災區域中，正需要大量的維　命X！</p>
<h3>上車問題</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>星期日的南京路上，這裏那裏到處可以遇見西洋人和他們的太太。他們對於白色人種的女人是最講禮貌的，處處都在實行「Ladiesfirst」這個信條，可是對於中國女人就不是這樣，似平中國人就不該受到他們白種人的這種禮貌，說來眞够令人氣短</p>
<p>不過中國男子現在倒也努力地「尊重」女人起來，也在處處實行「Ladiesfirst」這個信條，中國女人雖不能免去白種男子的藐視，但仍能得到本國男子的「溫存」，伊們還算是有幸福的！</p>
<p>前天在新世界附近雜在人羣裏守候公共汽車，發生一對中國「洋化式」的夫婦和「來路貨」的一對因為搶着上車而起的小小糾紛。那個中國男子為了講究西洋禮貌起見，正想「擁護」他的女人上車時，忽給一隻手背上滿是黃毛的手臂拉住，同時他聽到「Ladiesfirst」這句來路貨的央語，他不好意思違抗服從這個信條的外國男子！外國女人就利用這個時機上了車，那外國男子也就跟着想上車，但竟給一隻手背上滿露着靑筋的手臂拉住，他也同樣地聽到「Ladiesfist」這句英語，他似乎因為中國人竟敢和他搗亂而覺得驚奇，但他看到中國男子的左方確是站着他的滿想上車的太太，於是他覺得「Ladies」這個字的意義是不該劃分種族的！他無可奈何地收回他踏上汽車的一隻脚！</p>
<p>我現在恨不能知道那個男子的姓名，因為他能够替我們中國女人爭回一些面子！</p>
<h3>分贓不匀！</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>吃的時候，先由御膳房裏給伊端出一具銀製的小煖鍋來；因為有菊花的時候總在秋天，煖鍋已快將成為席上的必需品了，雖然似乎還早一些，但也還不足令人驚奇，所堪注意的是菊花和煖鍋的關係。原來那煖鍋裏先巳盛着大半鍋的原汁鷄湯或肉湯，上面蓋子做得非常合縫，極不易溫度消失，便是那股鮮香之味，也不致騰出來。其時太后座前已早由那管理膳食的大太監張德安好了一張比茶几略大幾許的小餐桌，這桌子的中央有一個圓洞，恰巧可以把那煖鍋安安穩穩地架在中間；原來這桌子是專為這個意義而設的。和那煖爐一起打御膳房裏端出來的是幾個淺淺的小碟子，裏面盛着已去掉皮骨，切得很薄的生魚片或生鷄片；可是為了太后性喜食魚的綠故，有幾次往往祇備魚片，外加少許醬醋。</p>
<p>那洗凈的菊花瓣自然也一起堆在這小桌子上來了。於是張德便伸手把那暖鍋上的蓋子揭了起來，但並不放下，只擎在手裏候着，太后便親自檢起幾許魚片或肉片投入湯內，張德忙將爐蓋重復蓋上。這時候吃的人——太后自已——和看的人——我們那一班——都很鄭重其事的悄悄地靜候着，幾十道的目光，一起射在那暖鍋上。（四二四）</p>
<h3>殃及池魚</h3>
<p>— （爾玉）</p>
<p>中國人無論做什麼事，多少帶有點不求甚解的脾氣，事業所以呆滯不進未嘗不是原因。就以讀書一門來說，現在的學生最喜賣弄聰明，一本很厚的書，不過半天讀完了。實在能否有深確的了解，這是誰也管不了的。我舉個極淺近的例子，「殃及池魚」大部份人的解釋是災禍及於池中之魚了。其實「池一「魚一之中缺落一個「神」字，「池仲魚」是楚國的士，他的家被鄰火燒掉，於是有「殃及池魚」這一句話，現在有很多人人把來用刊文章裏去，至於它的來源，早巳湮沒無聞了。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由</p>
<p>還只半樓梯中，不曾上樓來，這就在身上掏出一塊手絹，一面擦着汗，一面向則誠點頭，笑道：總算不辱使命。周縣長還等着我談別的事，我不上樓了，請你回復藍專員一聲。說畢，掉頭就下樓了。自己走回房去，由稈志前門口經過，見他還在燈下看書，便自言自語的道：我就知道藍專員非請我帮忙不可！那不是吹。他雖是自言自語，那聲音還是不甚低矮。引得茶房立刻進來和他倒水泡茶。隨着裘則誠也就來拜訪，問他接洽的結果。介夫誇說了一陣，各事都已經說得風平浪靜。只是曾求賈先生介紹過一件事，現在賈先生有點不高興，不願再寫介紹信了，為了藍專員，頗有相當的犧牲。說着，不住的皺眉頭，還帶歎氣。則誠坐着默然了一會，倫看他的顏色，總有點不快，便沉吟着道：專員初到此地，是不是就能介紹人才，這個我不能知道。不過別的地方，也許可以為力。介夫立刻笑起來道：我並不是什麽大人物，談不上什麽開發西北，只要有飯吃，什麽地力，我也可以去的。則誠聽了，臉上不免帶點笑容。介夫立刻也正着臉色道：雖然不免有求助於藍專員，可是我决沒有什麽要挾的意味。就是不給我想法子，我依然是作調人到底的。我不是說過了嗎？我念起我們究竟是同鄉（三二四）</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>日本咖啡館的奇觀</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>吃咖啡原來是歐美人氏的習慣，不知怎樣流傳到了日本，造成了最神秘的魔窟。我們在日本風的中國新小說裏，作者總把東京銀座街的咖啡館，贊得像廣寒宮似的華麗，女侍如何姣豔，知識如何高深。使讀者想像到日本咖啡館，是怎樣好的去處。但是事實是大不同的，簡直是銷金的魔窟罷了。</p>
<p>日本咖啡營業之發達，令人可驚，凡是熱鬧市街，像銀座，新宿，淺草等處，觸目皆是。就是很冷淸的地方，也有他們的營業，、全東京至少有幾萬家。大街馬路兩旁，房價很大，又太觸目。所以都在附近的幽街僻巷裏，很小的門面，外百美麗的年紅燈，耀人兩眸。每到華燈初上，侍女們打扮得妖妖嬈嬈，在小門口隱頭探頸的候着顧客。</p>
<p>普通的咖啡館，地方十分狹小，儘你佈置得經濟，至多坐十多個人　五顏六色的小電燈，發着暗淡的燈光，侍女們挨着身子，坐在顧客的旁邊，任你戲弄。一座留聲機是重要的工具，奏着各種麻醉性的音樂，使顧客於色香味之外，再加聽覺。侍女們都能唱歌，和着留聲機，淸歌闋，眞要令人消魂。</p>
<p>一杯咖啡最貴，也不過兩角，他們全靠咖啡收入，那能維持。唯一目的是喝酒，幾瓶啤酒洋酒，價値便很可觀。况且價格沒有一定，兩個人喝一次，費二三十塊錢，是很平常的事情。侍女小帳更無可估價了，全由顧客隨意。但是遇着吝嗇的顧客，小帳太小了。伊們便要惡作劇，在你出門的時候，身上撒一握食鹽，表示不希望此種主顧登門了。</p>
<p>因為東京咖啡館的發達，鄉村裏的小姑娘，都往東京跑，旁的職業不容易找。如若年齡相當，面目姣好，便可到咖啡館去做侍女。因為咖啡館門外，一天到晚貼着雇用侍女的廣吿，大有來者不拒之勢。伊們至少是小學校畢業，好一些是女學校畢業的。有人說專門以上的女學生，也有入咖啡館的，那是鳳毛麟角究竟不多。伊們從下午起營業上市，至夜間十二時為止，大都有兩批人，輪流休息。伊們一天到晚要强作歡笑，陪着客人喝酒吸烟。肚子裏裝滿了啤酒咖啡，冷的熱的，也不是受用事情，所以伊們差不多不必吃飯，肚裏沒有餓的時候。</p>
<p>伊們的收入除了按月計算外，普通全靠顧客的小帳，好在他們都有各自的老主顧，不時要來大量報效，還可做做副業。否則時常更換的衣服，家裏的食用，如何可以維持呢？日本女子出嫁原來很遲，侍女們又都是黃毛丫頭，所以極易和顧客發生戀愛。為了失戀和婚姻問題而自殺的，每天總有好幾處。而同性戀愛，亦以女優和侍女最多。</p>
<p>大規模的咖啡館（有時稱洋酒店），有二三層樓，裝飾華麗，可與遊戲塲大公司並駕齊驅。侍女在二百以上，每人編訂號碼，送着小名片。顧客可以隨意選擇那一號呌伊陪座。此種咖啡館比較正經，各種食物都有定價，不過價格特貴。佐酒的小盆子，放在小車子上出售，一塊生豆腐，二三十莢毛豆，都要四角大洋，在我國小飯店裏購買起來，四五十文足矣。侍女的小帳也有規定，每人一元，但是另外小小帳，當然多多益善的。　座一處，此種大咖啡館已有兩三所，每夜都是應接不暇，要有好幾千元一天的營業。咖啡館大王李起東，是朝鮮人，以經營咖啡館而起家的。</p>
<p>日本人時常要批評美國人購究跳舞喝酒，奢侈靡費。但是自己國內的喝酒喝咖啡的惡習，也很興盛。此種魔窟已漸漸被朝野洞悉了，去年便不准學生入咖啡館，近來官廳想把銀座和丸之內的咖啡館洋酒館等，一併驅逐出境，那末這種神秘的魔窟，將要遷地為良了。</p>

<p>如果這完全是紙上談兵，那自然是不値識者一笑，如果這多少具有歷史的敎訓的意義的，那也就不能因為書生之談而目為虛誕了。我很可惡那些賣死人頭，拿無罪的死人，來作為罪惡的掩身符的人們。但有些古代哲人的思想結晶，却也有些地方，可為現代人指導的準規，過去歷史的某片斷，却也在某種情况之下，可為現代人借鑑的。</p>
<p>由人類進化的過程看來，人羣與人羣大規模的戰爭，已有很長久的歷史；在這長久歷史的過程中，由經騐而獲得的一些理論的戰術，只要梢有長久歷史的民族，都有相當的發展而傳留給現代人。這些經騐雖因時代的變遜及科學的發達，巳完全改變面目，而基本的戰爭倏件，却並沒有多大改變。翻開中國兵家所一向崇奉的經典孫子，那裏面告訴我們，「其用戰也勝久，則鈍兵；久暴師則國用不足，夫鈍兵挫銳，屈力殫貨，則諸侯乘其弊而起，雖有智者不能善起復矣。一，又說「取用於國，因糧於敵……智將務食於敵·」又說「軍無輜重則亡，無糧食則亡，無委積則亡」，我認為還是適合現代戰爭條件的，因為經濟的條件，無論古今中外的戰爭中，都占着一個很重要的地位，尤其在現代的戰爭，更為重要。現代全國動員的戰爭，其軍需之所需，决不是古代「馳車千駟」車千乘，帶甲十萬的小規模戰爭可比，現代國家的「內外之費，賓客之用，膠漆之材，車甲之奉，「也决不止古代那樣」日費千金」。所以一個國家，沒有穩固的經濟基礎，沒有雄厚的財政資源，而欲作長期的戰爭，最後沒有不勢窮力竭而吿失敗的。這在侵略國家是一個敎訓，也在被侵略的國家，可以當為增高反抗的一種信心。</p>
<p>事實上一個民族，當一個强弱懸殊的侵略者侵人疆土的時候，「事之以牛羊」，「事之以皮幣，事之以珠玉」，都不能免，而必要把整個的土地都拿去的時候，被侵略的民族，也只有「罄其所有地為光榮一擲」。這不是一種感情用事，而却是有其很重要的意義在內。這就是講一個被侵略的國家，如有「破釜沉舟」與敵人「同歸於　」的抵抗的决心，那末到了不轉已的時候，當然用不着敵人先來用飛機大砲，把重要都市炸毀，而先由自己來毀棄可為敵資的財源，集中險要，作長久戰，使「野無可掠」，敵人不能拿自己的資源，供其食用。雖則現代的國家軍需準備，决不止「單食」，現代交通運輸已極便利，不像古代那樣「千里餽量，士有飢色，樵蘇後爨，師不宿飽」，但一個廣大的幅員的國家，交通如此不便，持久戰這末幾年，敵人勞師遠來，我不相信輜重能繼糧食能繼，委積能繼而不歸於喪亡的他們？</p>
<p>我們拿歷史上的故實來做引證。西歷紀元前二八年加太基的將軍漢湼堡（Hannibal）侵入羅馬後，以漢湼堡的將才，十五年內，擾亂意大利境內，所向無敵。他在愛杜里亞境內，靠近塔拉西曼湖地方，消滅羅馬那地方的全部的軍隊，紀元前二一六年，在凱納地方擊敗羅馬將軍范祿的軍隊，殺死五萬人，俘虜一萬人。雖因缺乏圍城的戰具，漢湼堡未能攻破羅馬，不過羅馬的覆亡，已間不容髮了。但漢湼堡終因孤師深入，後援為羅馬大將小謝皮窩（P．CScipisogr）所斷，加之羅馬老將費邊（Fabius）實行其「費邊戰略，」避免與漢湼堡軍隊作正面衝突，而惟守護險要，斷絕漢湼堡梅上船隻的運輸，與攻擊漢湼堡之潰散軍隊。在這樣持久戰下，終於因小謝皮窩的領兵遠征阿非利加，而漢湼堡遂不得不退出意大利境內。假使歷史眞可為借鑑的話，這是最有敎訓意義的第一個史實。</p>
<p>翻開近代史來，我們也可以找到一個極有敎訓意義的史實。那就是拿破崙侵入俄國，被俄國擊敗的一段歷史。拿破崙由波蘭侵入俄國，他的失敗，我們知道，完全是地理上的原因，而不是戰術的不高明，因為拿破崙達到墨斯科以前，並沒有吃過敗仗，拿破崙總以為攻入墨斯科，亞歷山大第一會向他求和的，然而俄國政府却是寗願燒去墨斯科而不願向之求和，這却楚拿破崙始料所不及。執政的如此，而在民間，也是堅决反對的。我們談到托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平」中一節，我們就可知道當時的俄國民間是作怎樣有意義的消極反抗。</p>
<p>「每一個俄國人，並不要從理智的推演，結果，而只要從埋藏我們心的深處的及我們祖先深處的情感，就早能曉得什麽將發生。</p>
<p>「從斯莫倫斯克以上，在每一個俄國境內的鎭上與村，……發生着同樣事件，正如墨斯科一樣。人民等待敵人的來臨而毫不驚擾；他們沒有表示興憤；也沒有把一個人撕為肉醬，但不過靜靜等待他們的惡命到來，覺得他們自己身上有一種力量，會找出他們在危險時期所應當找的方法。</p>
<p>「並且當敵人快來的時候，人民中較富的人逃掉了，留下他們的財產；較窮的人留下來，燒毀一切留下來的東西。」（據加納脫英譯本「戰爭與和平」）</p>
<p>這地方我們可以看出斯拉夫人的民族精神，他們一方面燒毀他們的財產，表示不屈服，一一方面等待時機，以解救他們的為難，等到冬天一到來，全俄國都埋在大雪中，拿破崙的大軍終於忍不住飢寒冷而敗退了。這些軍隊變為一隊隊的沿途刦掠為生的潰軍。於是「俄國的農民，只要是有武器的，就起來襲擊，領他了的「大軍」，殺戮他們。正如HG威爾斯所說，拿破崙大軍的敗退，是一個歷史上「最偉大的悲劇」。</p>
<p>英國的瑟康拉德曾借一個俄國的老兵，把拿破崙大軍敗退的悽慘的形狀，描寫得淋漓盡致：</p>
<p>「這是我和我的同伴那時的第一次親近看到拿破崙的大軍。那時一個奇異的可怕的景象。……」羣正布爬行的快跌倒的飢餓的半瘋狂的羣衆。這一行列從離開半英里森林走出來，他們的頭在田野的黑暗中消失了。……他們一無抵抗。我只聽幾聲槍響，也許只不過放了半打的數目。他們的知覺似乎已在裏面凍結起來……</p>
<p>我的馬衝翻一個兵在地上。那可憐的落泊者穿着一個藍色的騎兵制服，完全撕壞與燒焦了，一塊塊地從肩上掛下來，他甚至速手都不仲出來抓牢我的鞍子救他自己的性命。他只不過向前跌下去。……J，Conrad：AWarriorsSoul）。不可一世的拿破崙，在他初出兵的時候，决不會想到這法國人所輕視的野蠻的一俄國人」（DesRussesSauvages），會給他這樣的一個大敗仗吃。假使歷史眞可為借鑒的話，這是最有敎訓意義的第二個史實。</p>
<p>末了我們要講到過去不久的史實，這些史實，在有些地方，可給人們一種對付外來敵人的勇氣的。內戰時代的俄國，農民與那些ShockBrigade，對於平定柯爾却克，鄧尼金和外來敵人，却有極大的帮助。他們的英勇的作戰，一方面雖由於對外來侵略者的奸淫擄掠，敵人侵入就佔領學校後立即就是「女人：露西亞姑娘，露西亞姑娘」的喊，這自然引起俄國人的非常憤怒，他方面，主要的還是一種堅定信力他們完全了解戰爭的意義，故他們雖明知失敗而並不退縮。毀滅中的主角萊奮生，在戰爭的開始，就預感到「我們要被人打敗的……一定」。最後，萊奮生衝出了重圍，雖也突然感到「……不知怎地，全身頓然失了氣力，萎縮下去了。人家也忽然覺得他很衰弱，很年老。」然而，最後他終於恢復了他原有的毅力。「他用了沉默的還是滋潤的眼，看看高遠的天空，這給麵包與和平的大地，這在打麥塲上的遠遠的人們，—他應該很快地使他們都變成和自己一氣……，他於是不哭了：他必須活着，而且來盡自己的義務。（以上見周譯毀滅）這描寫俄　國內戰時代的史詩，的確道出了那時一般俄國人的心中主要的徵象。所以殺敗了鄧尼金柯雨却克，也並不是偶然的。假如歷史眞可為我們借鑑的話，這是最有敎訓的第三個史實。</p>
<p>最後我仍拿詩人席勸的話來結束：</p>
<p>「最卑劣不過的是那樣的民族，它不能罄其所有的光榮一擲一。（見關譯奧里昂之女。）如果認為這是詩人感情的話，這種感情的話，却含有的云高的意義的。那些充滿灰頹，沒有理想在卑俗的惟利主義下打滾而斤斤較量鵝毛有多少輕重的人們，自然不會懂得這意義而認為虛誕的，那我自然也不屑辯了。</p>
<h3>自殺者（二）</h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>「我還不記得，藍醫生皺，皺眉尖，此刻他倒記起，件事情來了，於是他仲一仲手，很懊惱地叫了一聲：「三點了！脚又緩緩地不耐煩地踱起來。</p>
<p>牧師卻憤怒起來，手帕使勁地一擦，聲音像電鳴一般，連頂上的電燈也給他驚訝的一閃：</p>
<p>「怎麼你這樣容易遺忘呢？」</p>
<p>「你曉得自殺的人經過我的手有多少啊！而且他們的身世終是一律的。你是偶然的來看一次，偶然的看到一個，自然容易記得！」</p>
<p>牧師好像不曾聽到人家的話，他還是擦着鼻子大發雷霆：「你難道還能忘卻嗎？他從救護車上下來的時候，你說沒有用了，叫看護去打電話送斐倫屍所。後來看護把他行人工呼吸，你再仔細看時，你說還可救還可救，給他打了一針，於是慢慢地甦醒了，就是那一個，就是那一個呀！」</p>
<p>「唔，好像有這麽一個。他今天可以出去啦？」藍醫生好像是不耐煩，好像是認錯了，　緩綏地踴起步來。</p>
<p>牧師更興奪，更起勁，鼻子快要擦破了，手忙脚亂地去翻皮包。這時候他才記起自己從電梯下來到現在還不曾坐過，於是他用手揩一揩那白色的長凳，坐下來，皮包放在腿上翻着。</p>
<p>一本手記冊，他拿出來。翻到中間一面上，記着　生長，他把皮包一放，又站起來：</p>
<p>一你看，你看，這就是他的名字呀　」</p>
<h3>憧憬</h3>
<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>—在巴圖爾和顧原野上——</p>
<p>我們饑餓了，我們饑餓了！</p>
<p>走呵，快快地走呵，莫怕寒冷，莫怕風雪，爬過了松吉山，跨過了額爾古納河——</p>
<p>跳進了廣大的西伯利亞境域去。那是一個好地方，</p>
<p>那兒有工作，使我們多快活。</p>
<p>—布萊雅靑年人的歌是春天了。</p>
<p>春，在巴圖爾和顧原野，四處猶現着嚴冷，落漠，枯寂的景象。雪花潔凈的放散着皚皚的白光，飄舞地漫蓋着山野，樹林，村落，和靜止的河流。</p>
<p>大地是死樣的沉默。巴圖爾和顧原野是一片無邊際的荒凉的沙漠呵。、</p>
<p>我沒有悲哀。雖是亡命在這冰天雪地的巴圖爾和顧原野上，雖是我底心已給這流浪的窮困的生活的鋒箭穿滿了無數的，殘破的血點斑駁的洞；然而，我却絲毫不感到悽痛與哀傷。我反而萬分欣喜的邁勁着鋼鐵一般的堅步，逕直地向光明的處所奔走着我底未完成的路。</p>
<p>我勿項用懷念的心情去憂慮着那未來的時日。我深深地，深深地知道，那未來的時日飛滿着死滅的太陽復活的光芒。</p>
<p>我也勿須用懷念的心情去悵惘那沉淪在鐵蹄的壓榨下的遼遠的故鄉。我更深深地，深深地知道，故鄕的同胞終有一天會如火山的爆發般的叫囂。</p>
<p>（太陽撕破了天際間那一抹濃墨色的重濁的雲翳，遙遙的露着臉笑。）</p>
<p>假若生活足以改造我的思想，那　我願永遠流浪在這氣侯寒冷的空曙的巴圖爾和顧原野上。享受着這原野的充滿了一股生之活躍的氣息。風雪，飢餓，窮困，把我征服得變作一個冷酷的原始人的模樣了。我深入伊克圖魯山村中，我又跋涉在伊蘭哈達山的幽谷里。到最後是才流浪到這巴圖爾和顧原野上。</p>
<p>我在這裏度過了一個溫暖的冬夢。如今照季節說正是春天來了，可是山野仍括着十二月的怒號的寒風：草原，樹林，河流，小溪，死板板地像睡了似的，還沒露出一點兒春的影子。</p>
<p>春，快萌芽吧，我需要你溫暖的陽光。</p>
<p>西伯利亞或許也在結着堅硬的冰塊吧？落着潔白的雪片吧？我終於這麼想。於是，我曾憧憬着西伯利亞的美麗的夢境，又開始讓我不安分的奇異的幻想了。我不是也在受着飢餓的逼迫嗎？當我每次憶起了布萊雅靑年人的歌而細細的回味時，我是多麽高興而內心充滿了鼓舞的勇氣，想要馬上飛翔地爬過了松吉山，跨過了額爾古納河，跳進了廣大的西伯利亞境域去。</p>
<p>然而，我失望了—我底心不禁黯冷下去，像一灣永然的無波紋的幽寂的死水。</p>
<p>遙望着綿亘的起伏在額原古納河東邊的巴彥珠魯克一帶長蛇似的峯巒，我悽　了。唉，就嚷我這孤零零的浮浪人，徬徨在這荒凉的憂　的巴圖爾和顧原野上吧！</p>
<h3>郊外的早晨（上）</h3>
<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>天色，還是黑黝黝地，郊外的媒屑路上，早探出了幢幢的人影。雖祇是瞧得見對手的一些糢糊的臉影，但誰都是會那麽熟練地，會心地招呼出來：</p>
<p>「早。」</p>
<p>「噢，早。」</p>
<p>「今年生意難做哩。」</p>
<p>「唔唔，難做哩。」</p>
<p>照例是大家顚顚頭頸，笑笑，嘆着氣，寒喧得幾句話，便誰也不管誰，各幹各的去了。</p>
<p>人影，俊慢地散開，從各方面蠕動，忽而擴大，忽而縮小，隱沒。在阡陌間，在棉花田裏，在高梁叢中，在菜地上，在大糞缸邊，到處都散佈着這種灰白色的活動點子。到處盡都是那些勤勞不息的農夫呀！</p>
<p>哼喲！哼喲！頸勃子伸得筆直，牙根咬得緊緊的是在大路上奔跑的小菜販。他們在午夜裏就起了身，挑着那龐大而沉重的担子，此刻已跑了不少的路吶。</p>
<p>烘隆拱隆的老虎車也出現不。載着的是供都會有閒階級摩玩的鮮花。</p>
<p>那邊的煤屑路上，沙沙沙推着的是滿車滿車濕淥淥的衣服。太陽還沒探出頭來，這兒，雪白的，殷紅的，澄黃橘綠的奇裝異服，就已一件之給高高掛起在由四根竹竿撑起，一架一架的粗大繩架上。衣服在架上驕傲地飄揚，洗衣作工人在下面吁吁地喘着氣。</p>
<p>叮噹可噹走着的是送牛奶車。滿瓶滿瓶的奶午夜裏就從一條條奶牛身上擠出來，裝滿了瓶子，又擺滿了車子，就要送給幸運的人們享受了，牛給榨取得軟癱在奶棚的木架底下，擠奶工人還不肯卸去他們的白色衣帽呢！</p>
<p>在一個角落的凉棚下，一位老頭兒正赤裸着上身在嗽着口。一把焦黃的牙刷子死命地朝嘴裏來回地磨擦，一邊又嘟噥地駡着。</p>
<p>「根發格娘，哼，造拉格娘，衣裳撥小人着好呀！造拉格娘，梗大格年紀，哼……」</p>
<p>駡着駡着，呼的一口髒水潑在了地上。再就又伸出個食指挖進嘴裏，在那殘缺不完的排牙上面楷擦了一陣，右手的大姆指和食指就夾住了鼻子，呼的一聲，手一開張，一把碧靑碧靑的濃鼻涕拍的一下直射落在對過的剝落的墻壁上。</p>
<p>「造拉格娘！梗大年紀……」</p>
<p>老頭兒咕嚕着，弓着個背，又再補了一句。</p>
<p>茅棚的左面空地上，一個瘦得像猴子似地的小人，圍住了個褪色的破紅兜肚，端着一大碗泡飯，邊走邊哭。二條鼻涕直淌了下來。</p>
<p>老太婆躱在一個角落裏不作聲。手架在額角上眯着雙紅眼偷偷地朝前邊瞧了一下，乾癟的嘴微微動了幾動，接着連忙灣轉了頭來，就冷冷地『咇」的吐了一口唾沫，忙亂地又做起她的炊事來。</p>
<p>年輕的媳婦兒纔跑出了門口，眼糞還掛在眼角上，一手就捉着個大木盆，一手捲住了一大捆髒衣服，邊走着，還邊翹起了嘴唇。</p>
<p>蒂……嗒大……蒂……大嗒蒂……大……</p>
<p>一個絕早，駐紥在附近的兵營裏，喇叭又在吹了。</p>

<h3>羅斯爵士來華</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>負有調查中國經濟使命的英國羅斯爵士，巳於二十一日從日本繞道到我們中國來了。對於這位遠來的上賓，我國官塲，當有一番很熱烈的歡迎。我們也得在此略說幾句，以表歡迎之微意。</p>
<p>羅斯爵士來華的使命，是為調查我國的幣制。為什麽羅斯氏要來中國調查幣制呢？這是因為中國幣制太混亂了，對外沒有一定的匯兌比率，隨時要跟着英鎊或美元的屁股後面走。尤其是自從美國提高銀價以來，使中國幣制，為之焦頭爛額。因此，英國非常關心，特為派了羅斯氏到中國，看其情形究竟怎樣。目的是要叫中國銀元跟着英鎊走，不要再三心兩意，隨時受其他各國勢力的支配。這就是羅斯氏來華的眞意。換言之，就是英國要在貨幣上統制中國，使中國在貨幣上成為它的附庸。這是很明白的，當今各國的貨幣關爭，是帝國主義鬭爭的一個重要策略。中國正隨時有立卽變為美元附庸的可能，因之英國自然不能不亟亟想把中國幣制改觀一下。</p>
<p>這可以說是今日羅斯氏來我中國的一個重要使命了。從羅斯氏背後，我們很可以看到各國互相鬭爭奪取中國的複雜背景。羅斯氏來華，是否對於中國眞有助益，尙是問題，而中國之為俎上肉，確是巳成的事實了。這是一層。</p>
<p>其次，這次羅斯氏來華，本預定先到美國，但隨後忽又變史道路，不先到美國而從我國的東隣日本繞道到中國來。這裏面我們又可看到英國今時正是怎樣想在增加英口兩國問的友誼關係。英日的接近，表示兩國對中國問題，漸有傾向一致的可能。這裏很明白表示着，最近歐洲政局的緊張，使英國對於遠東方面，在互惠條件之下，不能不借重於遠東的强國，自然，中國又是第一個首當其衝</p>
<p>因此，今對於羅斯氏的來華，我們一般民衆，是懷着十二分的敬畏之意在苦笑着歡迎他。羅斯氏此行對於不堪再經榨取的中國，究竟會有多少利益呢？我們是無從預料的。我們但希望列國能原諒一些，不要再把刀劍儘量在我們身上抽。這一點，已是不可多得的望外之喜了。</p>
<h3>路</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>打幾個月前起，縣城外西門那條官道，每日里時不時看見一個胸前佩着徽章，戴近視厚眶眼鏡，後面隨着三兩個跟帮模樣的一夥人，有的掮着，「羅庚」盤，有的帶着紅旗的竹竿子，在那官道上來往逡巡着，從這邊那邊，先由戴近視眼鏡，穿中山裝的打開「羅庚」盤，摸出一根筆在紙面上東此一比，西劃一劃，另後跟帮的，就把旗子插在地上。回去了。隔一天又來，老是那幾惆人，老是那一套花樣。這隣近住居着的人們天天瞧到這樣子，他們眞覺得有些奇怪起來，但沒有人曉得到底是怎樣一回事。彷彿聽人說是測量地基，這官道快要關馬路，行汽車了。</p>
<p>可是有什麽要那麽累墜，弄了幾個月沒弄停當，他們眞猜不透，然而一提到闢馬路，他們却很有見地，很聘明似的聯想到一些麻煩的事。尤其是臨道的許多小店舖子，大家知道自己的房子要</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>拆掉了，拆掉了自得再造起來，只是憑什麼造呢，却是値得愁惱的。</p>
<p>一一你曉得，還要派走道的建築費和……</p>
<p>談到了的時候，有的還這樣解說，若是出於臨街的小店舖子的人們的口里，他的面孔上必定同時掛着一幅憂慮的陰晴影子。</p>
<p>一縣府的佈吿已經貼出來了！</p>
<p>這天晚上，長街上茶葉店舖主陳老七打城里回來，向隣店的人吿訴一條令人發愁的新聞。</p>
<p>一佈吿怎麽說的，有人急促的催問着。</p>
<p>陳老七站在微暗的燈光照着的店子前面，用着沉滯的口吻背述着：那佈吿叫我們商店子的限日自動拆卸，過期不拆卸便要派人來强硬執行。旁聽者都用着無表情的眼睛互覷，沒人回答，停一回各自默默散去。</p>
<p>陳老七他呢，這一夜聲乎合不上眼皮，因為他的店子才正在數月前新造成，現在又得毀，又得再造，年頭又不好，怎麼辦…？</p>
<p>三天後，全條道路給無數築路工人翻得一塌糊塗了。泥土小山阜似的堆滿着，有挑祖子的，有打碎石子準備舖路的，也有掘水溝子的。</p>
<p>兩旁的店舖子，也次第拆毀了。長街上，零亂地，騷雜地，幾乎述想道兒都給塞住。</p>
<p>延宕着不拆卸的也終於不得不拆了。</p>
<p>在這中間，足有兩三個月，甚至於半年之久，每家店舖子都是陷在半做生意半停頓的狀，開消却是不能省半文，一方面尙得攤什麼費什麼捐，一方面又要籌錢造新房子。加開直便是在渡難關。</p>
<p>半年後，馬路關成了，倒是馬馬虎虎用泥沙塡起來的，逢着落雨，卽刻到處都是窪窿，泥濘不堪，車子馳過去，總是四面飛濺着一陣污水來，這中間許多店鋪子繳出去的什麽捐什麼費的數目，似乎不小，而結果就是這麽一條馬路，大家當然悶在心里。</p>
<p>至於兩旁的店子呢，拆下去的是已經拆下去了，造起來的並不多，於是一條街反成當橫七竪八東倒西斜的四不像的街了，而且有不少就此關了門。早些日子這官道原來十分熱鬧的，如今反而十分冷落着，從那兒走走，頗引起一種不同的感觸。</p>
<p>公路落成典禮舉行過了，接着開始通車子了，走遠道的人們有了汽車來代步子，當日暮急着要趕回家的時候，自然感到非常的方便，但苦了另一些人，却是無人想到的。以路的不牢固，草草成事，汽車打上面蹂躪着，薄弱的地方漸漸低陷下去，有些地方却高上來，再加淋幾次大雨，路便像山坡一樣崎嶇了，車子在走着，就像浮在水里的船那樣搖簛，利害的時候，也會倒下來，也因此差不多時時闖禍，猛的一個岔子，車身跳起來，一直開到店子裏，也許一直從路人身上肚子上踹過去，而後躺下來，於是汽車出事輾死人不知有過多少回數了。雖然公路通車還不上兩三月。</p>
<h3>菜販阿五</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>提起菜販阿五，在這市口是有些小小名氣的。他住在城外十多里路的朱鐵，每天担了滿筐的菜到這市口來已是市上最熱鬧的時候了。在這市口做菜生意的不只菜販阿五一個；阿五旣有了名氣，其餘的菜販只能趕早到市口來抵抗的一法。但是沒有用，公館人家是「吃名氣」的，阿五的菜好，要等着阿五，所以阿五担上的菜沒有賣完之前，其餘的菜販就休想招到一個主顧。</p>
<p>「哼，阿五的菜澆糞，我們的菜也是澆糞，不見得他的糞味道特別好！」</p>
<p>那些菜販們做不到生意的時侯，故意提高了喉嚨，諷刺「提籃頭」的主顧。但是「提籃頭」是受命於他們的主子的，主子要吃阿五的菜，他們沒有辦法不買阿五的菜。雖然每天聽到那些更齷齪的諷刺話，還是趕着買阿五的菜。</p>
<p>阿五見到生意好。他就每天挑了更多的菜出來，這市口上的菜生意幾乎是由他獨家經理了。這樣，市口上就沒有安寗的日子，起初是大家鬥口，後來動武的事時常發生。講到打架，阿五也有一手三脚毛的，可是其餘的菜販聯合起來，阿五不是對手了。而且他們想出種種故意作弄的方法來；等着阿五挑菜出來的時候，半路上就挑釁，要是阿五一還嘴，雙方扭住就打，凑冷眼的把他的菜筐傾到泥溝里。</p>
<p>阿五做不到生意好幾天了。於是他想出方法來跑公館，他每天挑着菜到廣房里去，這是其餘的菜飯無法禁止的。不過市口上倒底有些生意好做做了。</p>
<p>在菜販阿五方面，他也有層特別利益，就是少了「提籃頭」中間人的分利，他可以在那些喜歡「吃名氣」的老爺太太面前賣得更好的價錢。雖然他把不少的主顧放了，而他的進欵是不會减少的。</p>
<p>但是幾個月之後，阿五的生意範圍越做越小，這倒不是其餘的菜販又想出了什麼方法來破壞他，是阿五自家懶跑。他老是獃在幾家熟識的公館里和娘姨廚子撩天，天南地北地會獃上許多時間，有時更帮帮人家的忙，要是人家隨意地招呼他吃飯，他竟亳不客氣地坐上桌子去的，把預料中要送的幾家公館都置之腦後，這樣阿五失了信用，他的主顧漸漸地移向市口其餘的菜販了。</p>
<p>阿五放棄他的好生意，因為他的小名氣而使人懷疑了；尤其是和他敵對的其餘菜販們。在市口，大家有意無意會談到這件事。那些「提籃頭」的亦掉了口風說：「大家一樣是菜，阿五又不是用人參湯澆的！」</p>
<p>菜販們做着了生意，都得意起來：</p>
<p>「阿五的糞比我們的香呢！」</p>
<p>每天市口上阿五做了談話的中心。</p>
<p>但是阿五他轉着什麽念頭呢？有一天，一個驚人的新　傳　言這小小的城市——他拐騙了一家公館里的婢女逃了。</p>
<p>市口上的議論是：</p>
<p>「阿五的菜好？阿五拐女人的本領更好呢！」一邊忙着紮菜的菜販，一邊互相應和地笑了起來。</p>
<h3>風颱</h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>故鄉管颱風叫風颱。家裏來了信，說是這回故鄉又鬧了風颱，我的華裔遂被證實了。多少天以來報紙上三番兩次地登載着颱風過境的消息，說是南海一帶已遭了打擊；都時我便很惦念着故鄕，我想着，這回可別又來一次風　吧，我為故鄉祝福。豈知我的懷疑竟被證實了，家裏來信說，椰子樹颳倒了不少。半結穗的稻子，颳成了一面倒，垂頭喪氣地泡在水裏。一</p>
<p>風　在故鄉是常見的，八九月之交，就常有；從菲律賓飛來的颶風常會從故鄉的東北角吹過，然後沿着海岸吹向台灣東去。小風　是沒有什麽的，一大了便會遭殃，吹倒了椰樹倒算不了什麽損失，吹光了稻子，吹走了房瓦，損失可就大了。記得有一年的風颱眞大，那時我還小，風就吹得我不敢出門；就站不住，在曠野里就眞站不住的。丈多長的椰葉。飇得滿天飛，是毀了多少房子！幾乎是家家都遭殃的。記得村邊上黑對婆的　子，這是　一棵　倒了的椰樹軋塌了的，她那八九歲的小孫子，那剛</p>

<p>一出生便沒子父母的孩子，多可憐，死在瓦礫堆裏！這就毀了黑村婆的命根，祖宗的香烟沒人再續，黑村婆雖從險里逃了生，却瘋了起來，成天指着天邊駡，帶涕帶淚的；現在那塌了多半部的房子還在，黑村婆也還孤守着那半塌的房子過着不死不活的生活，，在祈禱和咒駡里打發過日子；那麽一個半瘋的老婆子，也眞苦。我一想起她我也是會指着天邊駡的。這使我很怕，很惦念着故鄉，不要再來一次飛天禍吧，我爲故鄕祝福。</p>
<p>固然風吹大了會使家家遭殃，但小風颱却是頗有意思的，也許是小時候覺得很有意思，很喜歡。小風　是沒有什麽損失的，這頗有點像誰說過的病；他說病不可病得太大，一大了就危險，至少也是會使身心够苦的；小病却有意思：沒有什麽損失，且還可以食些好東西，補養補養，這是多好：就是躺着翻些軟性刋物，看着各色藥瓶子戚到那麽一點悽凉味，也是够詩意的；說是這是頗幸福的，我想也許對。風　也是如此，小風颱是頗有意思的。</p>
<p>小風颱就不說是風勵也行，不過和平常的風雨不同，也就叫做風　了。不同之處想來還並不在風雨的大小，在味兒，風颱是有風　味的。警如海嘯，雲低而速，就得說是風　味，平常風雨是未必有這樣的先兆的。海嘯遠聽去有如悶雷，音沉而鈍，有規律，陣遠陣近，也有些像在遠處聽大瀑布聲；老年人是能從這聲音里聽到風颱的大小的，他們懂得風颱的預兆，也就比平常人早得些憂愁，看着椰葉翻舞，耳邊是海嘯聲，無論是小風颱也吧，飛天禍也吧，他們是很少快樂的，「海嘯得很急啊」，憂愁地注視着天邊，於是便會計算到年成了，希望雲彩薄些吧；薄些，心底才能存着較多的希望的。實在，風颱要小了些，他們的快樂，眞是很難形容的，就像得到了失而復得的貴重物品那樣，其快樂處就眞非如得小病所能比了。這是老年人的心情。我的喜歡小風　，倒不是由年成上計算來的，孩子的心情是不甘寂寞的，想玩；小風颱就會使他們滿足。記得小時偶遇小風颱我常會興奮得夜不能眠，半夜還打着燈籠到椰子林裏去拾椰子，想來這是很有意思的。遠遠聽得椰子落地的一聲響，再”着風　，隨着聲起處尋去，在小灌木叢里拾起一個頗有重量的東西，這在小孩子心目中，可就是有趣事了。這是一端，喜歡小風颱的緣故還多，譬如風雨夜聽大自然的音韻，白天看行雲流水，滿天的竹葉飛，如春來燕；這些東西在記憶里都釘得很深。說起來小風颱還是溫和得可親的東西。</p>
<p>可是這回却糟了，沒那麽溫和。怕飛的不是竹葉而是連根的竹桿子吧。家里的來信祇說到稻子，而這也就够可悲了；雖未必準是飛瓦塌房的飛天禍吧，想來又該有多少人埋怨年頭了。但祇要不是飛天禍就也還好的。，</p>

<h3>關於「暴風雨」感想之類的話</h3>
<p>— 魏鶴齡</p>
<p>「人之初」中我做爸爸，「暴風雨」中我也做爸爸，好像我天生就是來做爸爸的。在「人之初」中我吃官司，「暴風雨」中家破人亡，都是受難爸爸，眞的，年頭兒不景氣爸爸也難做了！</p>
<p>「暴風雨」上演在這平靜的秋天，可是世界是這秋天一樣的平靜嗎？</p>
<p>在像今年中秋節一樣陰慘的日子，「暴風雨」總比那沉默地如同游絲和網膜落着的細雨，較為有趣些吧！</p>
<p>有人問我演「暴風雨」的感想，但我却先要知道「暴風雨」這片子在人們的心中怎樣想着。</p>
<p>在民族頻危的今日，「暴風雨」這部片子，也許不是毫無意義的，但願它能在甜醉的男女們的心中捲起比這大一點兒的「暴風雨」，那我就感到滿足了。</p>
<p>我等待着一個很不客氣可是認眞的批評。</p>

<h3>一個歐遊的紀念</h3>
<p>— 胡蝶</p>
<p>「夜來香」對於我個人，這是一件很好的紀念品。</p>
<p>「夜來香」開拍的時候，還在去年冬天。剛剛拍到一半的時候，便因為參加蘇聯國際影展會去國，不得不暫時擱置起來，直隔了五個多月漫遊歐洲歸來，這才繼續工作，現在總算全片吿成了。——我對於「夜來香」，不知不覺有了很大的好感，因為它可算是我歐遊紀念的作品。</p>
<p>至於我在這片中的演技呢，我雖然更加用功，更加努力，却不敢自信有特別好的成績。自然，我跑了一次歐洲，眼界廣了許多，知識也增長了不少；但若說因為這次遊歷老察，演技會在一時間突然進步起來，是不會的。我祇有這樣的自信：用我的生活經騐，用我遊歷所得的知識，再加以誠懇的努力，使自己的演技能有一個新的進境。</p>
<p>現在「夜來香」就要公映了，我期待着觀衆諸君的嚴正的指示。（該文係明星寄來的覆寫稿）</p>

<h3>Death of French Minister to China, Mr. Wilden</h3>
<p>Sudden Heart Attack Proves Fatal Despite Efforts to Save Him. Mr. Wilden Served in China for Many Years. President Wang and Wife Send Condolences to Mrs. Wilden.</p>
<p>(Beijing) French Minister Mr. Wilden passed away at his residence last night at 10 o'clock due to a sudden heart attack, despite attempts to save him. Mr. Wilden had been stationed in China for many years and played an instrumental role in the signing of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. Mr. Wilden had a long history of heart issues, typically experiencing mild episodes every summer. These episodes would resolve quickly after diagnosis and treatment. This summer, however, upon examination, doctors confirmed a chronic pneumonia diagnosis. After leaving the French hospital, he rested at his official residence. Last night, he even casually invited representatives from various countries to a dinner party hosted by his wife. Shortly after, a servant urgently requested Mrs. Wilden to come upstairs, only to find Mr. Wilden already deceased. Upon hearing the news, the guests left in disappointment. Many visited this morning to pay their respects. A formal funeral will be held in the coming days. The French Embassy has urgently telegraphed its government to report the matter. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) French Minister Mr. Wilden was treated at a French hospital this summer for pneumonia. After recovering, he went to Beidaihe for recuperation and returned to Beijing at the end of last month to manage embassy affairs. He occasionally felt unwell from the 22nd, but his spirits remained good. On the evening of the 23rd, at 8:00 PM, he hosted a friendly banquet at the embassy, with Mrs. Wilden personally receiving guests. At 8:40 PM, he suddenly felt fatigued and unwell, so he excused himself and went upstairs, intending to rest briefly in his bedroom. However, after only a few steps, he collapsed and fainted, passing away at 9:00 PM. According to medical diagnosis, he suffered a heart attack and succumbed before treatment could be administered. The body was placed in a coffin at noon on the 24th, and a memorial service is scheduled for 11:00 AM on the morning of the 26th at the Dongjiaominxiang Church. The remains will then be temporarily placed in the Xishiku Church in the afternoon. In addition to urgently reporting to the government, the French Embassy has lowered its flag to half-mast for three days starting on the 24th to express grief. Chinese and foreign officials visited to offer condolences on the 24th. Embassy affairs are temporarily being managed by Chargé d'affaires Mr. Hobernot. Mr. Wilden was 56 years old. He had been in China for many years, becoming the French Minister Plenipotentiary to China on April 28, 1932, making many contributions to the promotion of Sino-French relations. His wife and children were by his side. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) French Minister to China Mr. Wilden had been in China for five years and greatly enhanced Sino-French friendship. Most recently, he resolved the long-standing Sino-French Vietnamese Commercial Treaty Annex. The Foreign Ministry received a telegram from special envoy Cheng Xigeng in Beiping on the afternoon of the 24th, reporting Mr. Wilden's passing on the 21st evening. President Wang immediately sent a telegram in the names of the Premier of the Executive Yuan and his wife to Mrs. Chaplin Wilden at the French Embassy in Beiping, expressing condolences and grief. In addition, the Foreign Ministry sent a telegram on the afternoon of the 24th to our representative in France, Xiao Jirong, instructing him to express condolences to the French government on behalf of our country. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) French Minister to China Mr. Wilden passed away at night due to heart failure. Earlier this year, Mr. Wilden suffered from pneumonia, but recovered several months ago. He had been in good health recently and even played golf a few days ago. Last night, he suddenly fell ill at his residence in the embassy and did not recover. Mr. Wilden had been the French Minister to China since July 1930. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) French Minister Plenipotentiary to China Mr. Wilden passed away last night at 10 o'clock due to heart disease. Mr. Wilden had been stationed in China for many years, and after taking leave to return to his country last year, he returned to China on November 7. On May 4th of this year, he represented the French government in signing the Sino-French Vietnamese Border Relations Special Agreement Annex with the National Government, resolving a four-year-old case. This act was sufficient to promote Sino-French amity, largely due to the efforts of the French Minister. In May of this year, Mr. Wilden suffered from paralysis, nearly succumbing to it, but later recovered after recuperating in Beidaihe. Unexpectedly, a sudden heart attack proved fatal. Both Chinese and French diplomatic circles are deeply saddened by this news. (Havas dispatch on the 24th) French Minister Plenipotentiary to China Mr. Wilden passed away last night in Beiping. The following is a brief biography of Mr. Wilden: Mr. Wilden was born on March 23, 1879. After graduating from the university's law department, he came to China at the end of the 19th century, serving as an interpreter for the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau. During the Boxer Rebellion, Mr. Wilden, along with several foreigners, bravely went from Baoding to Tianjin, earning him recognition at the time. Later, he returned to France, took the diplomatic officer examination, and passed on May 5, 1905, becoming a trainee consul. On June 3, 1905, he served in the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On December 12, 1905, he returned to China to serve as a trainee consul at the Chongqing Consulate. On July 1, 1906, he was transferred to the Chengdu Consulate as a trainee consul. On June 10, 1907, he was promoted to Vice Consul in Chongqing, serving for one year. Until May 3, 1910, he served as the acting French Commissioner in Yunnan Province (at that time, France had no consular rights in Yunnan Province, so a commissioner was established to handle local Sino-French affairs). On February 22, 1911, he was promoted to Second-Class Consul. On October 10 of the same year, he also served as the Commissioner in Yunnan Province. On August 2, 1914, Mr. Wilden returned to France to serve as an assistant in the Asia Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On February 26, 1916, he was promoted to First-Class Consul. On April 1, 1917, he served as the Acting Consul-General in Shanghai. On September 7, 1918, he was officially appointed as Consul-General in Shanghai. On August 3, 1920, he was promoted to Consul-General. On October 1, 1925, he was promoted to Minister Plenipotentiary, appointed as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Siam. On April 30, 1927, he was transferred to Minister to Persia. Finally, on December 10, 1929, he became the Minister to China. On April 28, 1932, he was promoted to First-Class Minister. In summary, Mr. Wilden spent the longest time in China, spoke Chinese fluently, and was familiar with the Chinese situation. Therefore, his appointment as envoy to China was particularly appropriate. Mr. Wilden was amiable and approachable in his dealings with others, and he fulfilled his duties to promote Sino-French relations. His achievements in China are countless. In recent years, the friendship between the two great republics of China and France has grown increasingly strong. Mr. Wilden's contributions cannot be forgotten. Now that he has suddenly passed away, all those in Chinese and French diplomatic circles mourn together. (Havas news on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) French Minister Mr. Wilden passed away at the embassy in Beiping on the evening of the 23rd. The President and his wife sent a telegram of condolence to Mrs. Wilden on the 24th. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry telegraphed Acting Chargé d'Affaires Xiao at our embassy in France, expressing condolences to the French Foreign Ministry on behalf of the government, and sent a letter to the Beiping Municipal Government requesting it to send two rows of cavalry and a band to participate in the French Minister's funeral. It is reported that the French Embassy in Beiping plans to hold a funeral for the French Minister on the 26th, and the Beijing French Embassy plans to hold a requiem mass at the Catholic Church on the morning of the 27th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Today, people have been continuously visiting the French Embassy to pay respects to Mr. Wilden's remains. Mr. Wilden was the president of the Beijing Club. Last night, he was still using the phone from the French Embassy to handle matters related to the club. Unexpectedly, half an hour later, he passed away due to heart failure. Earlier this year, Mr. Wilden suffered from pneumonia, but recovered several months ago. He had been in good health recently and even played golf a few days ago. Mr. Chaplin, aged 55, first came to China 25 years ago. After the Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi, he followed the army from Tianjin to Beiping to lift the siege of Dongjiaominxiang. He was later awarded a medal of honor. He then served as consul in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Yunnan. From 1917 to 1925, he served as Consul-General in Shanghai. He was later promoted to Minister to Siam and Poland. In December 1929, he came to China again, succeeding Mr. Teil as Minister. The date of his funeral has not yet been determined.

<h3>After the Breach of the Dike in Shuyang</h3>
<p>Three Counties Are Still Not Safe. Dozens of Villages in Shuyang Are Submerged and Urgently Need Rescue. Chen Guofu Orders Haizhou, Shuyang, and Guanyun to Jointly Conduct Rescue Operations. The Water Level on the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway Is Stable, and All Trains Are Running Smoothly.</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Haizhou news: After the breach of the Liutang River dike in Shuyang, the Yao dike is in critical condition. County Magistrate Deng Xianghai of Shuxian has moved to the left bank of the Chaimi River, gathering 10,000 laborers to build a sub-dike to protect half of the county. However, with the Liuti dike breached, Donghai and Guanyun are both under pressure. Chen Guofu and Xu Dingkang have both telegraphed the three counties to expedite the construction of the dikes along the Chaimi, Wanggong, and Hanyang Rivers to prevent the disaster area from expanding. (Special cable on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Yellow River water flows through Liutang and enters the sea via the Guanhua estuary, which is the fastest route. However, the benefits and harms to the three counties of Donghai, Guanyun, and Shuyang are closely related. According to County Magistrate He of Donghai, who arrived at the Yishu Flood Control Office from Tangjiang, Shuyang on the 22nd, the new dike on the north bank of the Shuchai River is more than 20 li long, and the new dike to the south of the Shangxin River is also more than 20 li long. The water from the Shaqi and Liutang Rivers is turbulent, and tearing and other unfavorable phenomena have been discovered. He and County Magistrate Deng of Shuyang have agreed to supervise the construction separately, day and night, but unforeseen events are unavoidable. However, the section is up to 40 li long. If Guanyun does not provide assistance, the Yanhua River is at risk. The Flood Control Office has specifically telegraphed the Guanyun County Government, urging it to plan comprehensively and implement joint defense among the three counties, hoping to overcome the forces of nature with human effort. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) After the collapse of Yangkou Qianwei in the north of Liutang River in Shuyang, there are still collapses of old dikes and new dikes in Zhoujia Wharf and Guanzhuang. Nearly 10,000 people from the two counties of Donghai and Shuyang are stationed to rush repairs and block the project. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shuyang telegraphed Xuzhou on the 24th, stating that the old dike on the left bank of the Liutang River in the county has collapsed, and the Yao dike is under pressure. 3,000 laborers have been hired to rush repairs, but the ten materials are loose and leaking everywhere. Collapses have occurred near Qianwei, and the water is surging, with dozens of villages submerged and houses collapsing. Rescue is urgently needed. County Magistrate Deng has moved to the left bank of the Chaimi River, gathering 10,000 laborers to build a sub-dike to protect half of the county. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Yishu District Flood Control Office, recent reports from the counties of Shuyang and Guanyun indicate that floods in eastern Shuyi and southern Guanyun have become unmanageable. Most of the incidents occurred along the north bank of the Liutang River. In addition, according to a telegram from Commissioner Shao of Tongshan, 30,000 disaster victims from Xuzhou will be sent to participate in the second phase of the Huai River diversion project, which is under negotiation. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Xuzhou Flood Relief Temporary Relief Association has formed a disaster relief branch and will purchase more than 1,000 yuan temporarily raised in this city to purchase food and transfer it to the branch for relief distribution. The temporary meeting has ended to unify disaster relief affairs. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Longhai Railway News: The water level along the eastern section is gradually stabilizing, and all trains are running smoothly. However, the Taizhao branch line has been severely damaged and is still under repair. If the water does not rise again, it is expected to be open to traffic in about three or four weeks. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Pei telegrams stated that the water in Micro Lake is still rising slowly, but the momentum is not strong, and the dikes have not been in danger. The laborers are still strictly defending. The authorities are now concentrating their efforts on disaster relief. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The south dike of Yaowan in Suqian, north of the Grand Canal, was infiltrated by the Yellow River, and a 20-foot breach occurred on the evening of the 22nd. Water poured into the dike. Fortunately, there was a waterproof dike inside the dike, which has not yet overflowed. Most of the merchants and people in the dike have fled. Many disaster victims who took boats south were overturned by wind and waves in the Zaohe River, which was extremely tragic. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The dike body at the junction of Donghai and Shuyang counties is mostly newly built and seeps water. In addition to the officials and people of the two counties selecting dangerous areas to sign trees and bundling them, a large number of sacks and cattail bags are prepared and transported for use. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) In the past, the Huai, Pi, and Salt Rivers could not be directly reached, and the Yellow River water flowed south. Now it is unimpeded. It also reaches Pi Yi from Shuyang via the Shacha River, and from Zaohe Town, it goes east along the abandoned Yellow River dike to Tongshan. These are all routes that could not be navigated in the past. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After the Liutang River was breached, it cut off the Huaihai Automobile Road. Now the Huaihai traffic is cut off, and the water is rising. It will take time to restore it in the future. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The breach in Pida Yushu has not been closed, and the disaster in Suqian and Shuyang is becoming more serious. Xu Dingkang, director of the Grand Canal Flood Control, has now sent Shi Shaowu to prepare for the closure, but the mouth is wide and deep, and it is difficult to obtain personnel nearby. Xu believes that the matter is extremely difficult. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The reporter went to Shuyi on the 23rd to inspect. At first, the stone steps of the north and south wharves of the Li Yun North Gate Boat Bridge were all submerged in the water. The river center was full, and the water was rushing very fast. After crossing the three districts of Huaiyin, the water on the south bank of the Yanhai River reached the Wangying North Dike. The water on the north bank of the Xiaoying Zhao surname chrysanthemum garden was one mile wide. When arriving at the north lake and dangs on both sides of Qianliutang and Sandaojian, the distance was ten times greater. The autumn water in the Yanhai River was all the same color. I just knew that traffic was still open two weeks ago, but now it is impossible to travel without a boat. Arriving at Shijiaqiao, I landed ashore and inquired that the two northeastern villages in Shuyi were the most serious, and the residents along the Wanggong Chaimi River were all in danger. The biggest reason is that the new dike is loose and the water is rampant, which is prone to accidents. On the one hand, the rise and fall of Yishu is unpredictable until the frost falls. Every day, I hope that there will be no storms or heavy rains. The whole city is fighting against the water. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>White Tiger Mountain Peak Collapses Outside Haizhou City</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Haizhou news: The White Tiger Mountain outside Haizhou city suddenly collapsed on the 22nd, and the sound was heard for several miles.

<p>(Jinan) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Han Fuju, stating that closing the Yellow River breach is for the sake of the people of Jiangsu and Shandong, for the sake of the national economy, and for the sake of the water conservancy system. It must be done, and preparations must be made immediately. Sacrificing a few is still worthwhile. Resisting water should be as urgent as resisting the enemy, and time must not be wasted. Please expedite the matter in conjunction with the Shandong Provincial Government. In any case, it must be completed before the flood season in March next year to avoid another major disaster and heavy damage to the country and the people. I believe you will agree. Han has already telegraphed back the progress of the closure and the current situation. In addition, Kong Xiangrong and Lei Han, the Yellow River Commission has allocated another 10,000 yuan for the Zhu River emergency rescue. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Closing Committee plans to purchase stone from Sunjiawan, Yanshan County. The Longhai Railway allows no additional tracks to be laid. The Jiaoji Railway will continue to allocate a train of freight cars to transport materials. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Chairman Chiang sent a cable urging Li Sheng to start construction quickly. The Closing Committee has already transported 29,000 sacks for use. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Economic Commission telegraphed Han that 300,000 yuan would be allocated first for the closure fee, and the rest would be raised and allocated successively. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The most important part of the Yellow River water conservancy project is Dongzhuang. Chairman Han of Shandong has repeatedly telegraphed to urge for funds. The Economic Commission instructed Secretary-General Zhang Hanying to go to Lu to meet with Han, and allocate 200,000 yuan as soon as possible and remit it to Lu on a fixed date. The remaining 3.7 million yuan is currently facing financial difficulties and will be sought gradually. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The County Party Department previously telegraphed the party departments and governments of Xuzhou, Huaihai, and other counties to unite and request the central government to quickly close the breach in western Shandong. The counties have replied that they will unanimously submit a firm request to the central government. The joint telegram has been sent, and we are waiting for the central government to urge the closure to proceed. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sets a Deadline to Complete Opium Addict Registration This Year</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) On the 24th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed all provinces and cities, setting a deadline to complete opium addict registration this year. The original telegram is as follows: (Omissions) The strict implementation of opium prohibition will continue until the Republic of China's 29th year. All provinces and cities across the country must completely ban opium cultivation, and there must be no more opium seedlings planted or opium addicts left behind. Over the years, I have promulgated regulations to urge implementation, and the results have gradually become apparent. The international community has praised this in unison. This year, the central government has issued a clear order appointing me as the Director-General of National Opium Prohibition to fully implement the limited-time ban plan, prohibit planting and smoking simultaneously, and intensify efforts without allowing any delay. The registration of opium addicts in each province and city is a crucial key to strictly prohibiting opium smoking. The Military Affairs Commission has repeatedly issued notices to urge implementation. I hereby reiterate the order that all provinces and cities must thoroughly complete the registration in the year of the 24th and report the registration details and numbers to the Military Affairs Commission for verification by the end of January of the 25th without delay. Otherwise, the responsible officials will be held accountable. Everyone is expected to comply. Chiang Kai-shek (Seal of the Military Affairs Commission on the 24th.

<h3>Our Request for a Council Seat</h3>
<p>League of Nations Executive Yuan Postpones Resolution. Submitting to a Committee for Review Will Indefinitely Postpone for One Year. Representative Yan Declares Willingness to Cooperate with International Economy</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although China has repeatedly stated, it will probably still have to wait quietly for a year before it can obtain a non-permanent council seat in the League of Nations Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan held a non-public meeting today to discuss China's request for a special council seat, which lasted a long time, and finally decided to submit this issue to the Fifteen-Member Committee, which was established two years ago to study the issue of council seats, for review. According to public opinion, this move will directly shelve the issue for one year. During the Executive Yuan's meeting, Dr. Yan Huijing, China's ambassador to Russia, expressed his generous remarks at the General Assembly's Technical Committee debate on the League of Nations' financial and economic authorities' affairs last year, asking the League of Nations to pay attention to China's difficulties in the current crisis. Any plan for international action that can get the world out of the current crisis, China can cooperate with it. China is still affected by the world's depression. Although there are signs of improvement in various parts of the world, most of these signs of improvement come from the arms industry, which should be noted. Dr. Yan continued to talk about the measures taken by the Chinese government to deal with the silver situation, saying that although there are these measures, the prices of Chinese goods have fallen because the purchasing power of the Chinese people has been weakened.

<h3>He Yaozu Returns to Geneva</h3>
<p>Highly Praises German Achievements. Perfect Organization Grasps the Entire Nation's Progress. China's New Life Should Focus on Such Trends. Will Attend the Fifth National Congress When Necessary to Support Proposals</p>
<p>(Geneva) He Yaozu, the Chinese minister to Switzerland, returned to Geneva today after visiting the Nazi Party conference in Berlin. He expressed his thoughts to reporters from the Central News Agency, stating that the Nazi Party's organization includes the promotion of political, economic, educational, and national defense policies. Due to the perfect organization, enthusiastic party members, and popular support, its strength has been able to grasp the entire nation and move forward. The new life of the Chinese Kuomintang depends on focusing on such trends, based on China's national conditions, historical facts, and party ideology system, and gradually implementing the entire plan. For example, the domestic labor service problem should refer to the corvée system of previous dynasties and the German compulsory labor system to form laws and implementation rules for promotion, which should be a part of all party and government work and not violate the principles of promoting benefits and eliminating disadvantages, so that the country and the people will benefit from it. He also said that he would attend the Fifth National Congress when necessary to support this proposal. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>The World Economy Amidst the Turmoil in East Africa</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Italo-Abyssinian affair is also a significant event in the world economy. Italy desires to obtain resources from Abyssinia, and is willing to initiate a war for it. However, "weapons are inauspicious." The Italian economy has already been greatly affected by preparations for war. Cash is fleeing, foreign currency is diminishing, and the circulation of bonds and banknotes is expanding daily. Even if it were to gain something after starting a war and prolonging it, it would be difficult to compensate for the losses. Although Italy has rejected the League of Nations' suggestions, the door to peace has not been entirely closed, probably also in view of this situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Great Britain is still striving to mediate the war. If it ultimately cannot reverse Mussolini's ambition, it will inevitably be the first to be drawn into the vortex of war. In the London market, the price of U.S. dollars has risen sharply day by day, and the British pound is fleeing. The reason for this is actually the influence of the defense deployments in the Mediterranean. Although the United States is determined to declare neutrality, in such a complex economic situation, even a slight mistake could lead to a repeat of the European war. Therefore, American merchants are extremely sensitive to the Italo-Abyssinian situation. In the New York market, stocks of metals, steel, and military supplies have all risen. American cotton also rose at one point, probably because merchants were concerned that Egyptian and Indian cotton would be damaged by the war. In addition, everything related to military affairs is showing signs of activity. "The arrow maker fears he will not injure people; the armor maker only fears he will injure people." Today's industry and commerce are in just such a situation.</p>
<p>During the European war, Japan took advantage of the opportunity and gained a lot. Taking only the capital of companies as an example, it rose from only 2 billion yen in 1914 to exceeding 10 billion yen in 1922. With the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian affair this time, the Japanese business community, with its rich experience, is once again making meticulous plans to reap the fisherman's benefit. Stock, exchange, insurance, and military industries are all making preparations. Even straw sandal merchants are thinking of selling their goods to the Abyssinians, who are accustomed to going barefoot. Japanese commercial operations are able to pay attention to both major and minor details, and are united as a whole to seek foreign development. When opportunities arise, they are unwilling to let them go easily. Is this why they are able to succeed?</p>
<p>Seeing the brewing of the Italo-Abyssinian war, Chinese merchants are also rushing to speculate. Gold labeling, securities, cotton yarn, flour, and wheat market conditions are rising and falling sharply, reaching a temporary peak. If war breaks out unfortunately, in this severe economic situation, how should we deal with ourselves? This is probably not something that these people who are obsessed with speculation have considered. They only want to take the opportunity to make a fortune. They find "watching a fire from across the river" enjoyable, without considering the fear of "a swallow's nest on a dangerous roof." This is truly the most heartbreaking thing. When considering their own interests, why don't our merchants also think about their responsibility to the nation?</p>
<h3>Final Mediation Fails; League of Nations in Dire Straits; Special Committee's Negotiations with Italy Yield No Results; Laval Expresses Firm Stance; Will the Rainy Season Prevent War Between Italy and Abyssinia?</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The failure of the five-nation special committee to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has placed the League of Nations in an extremely difficult position. The League of Nations can only choose one of the following two paths now:</p>
<p>(1) Abandon the principles of the League of Nations and allow Italy to do as it pleases;</p>
<p>(2) Uphold the League of Nations Covenant and allow Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations;</p>
<p>It is very difficult for the League of Nations to choose between these two. But, of course, it will be decided by a consensus. After the five-nation special committee met yesterday morning to study the Italo-Abyssinian replies to the committee's suggestions, its chairman, Madariaga, visited Italian chief delegate Aloisi, but the talks yielded no results. According to sources in the League of Nations, Laval's attitude was very firm during the committee meeting yesterday morning. An observer said that Laval's speech took the position of upholding the League of Nations Covenant, and was actually more about being a French foreign minister. Aloisi's remarks during Madariaga's visit could have been published last night, but because the wording needed to be slightly revised, it was decided to postpone it until today.</p>
<p>The five-nation special committee may need two days to draft a report to the League of Nations Council on the failure of the mediation. After this report is submitted, the Council will order the current special committee or a larger committee to formulate suggestions for future proceedings. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) British observers, in view of the end of the rainy season in Abyssinia and Italy's tough stance that the five-nation special committee can no longer carry out its work, hold the view today that the inevitable war between Italy and Abyssinia is not far away. Whether British Ambassador to Italy Drummond's talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night on behalf of British Foreign Secretary Hoare were the final effort to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian crisis, or, as some parties have reported, only reiterated that the British naval activities in the Mediterranean do not contain any intention to attack Italy, is not yet known. However, it is said that after the five-nation special committee confirmed that the remarks made by Italian representative Aloisi to committee chairman Madariaga were of an official and final nature, it abandoned its mission to mediate the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Aloisi's remarks against the committee's suggestions were very strong. British representative Eden initially did not believe it was of an official nature, but later learned that the Italian government's opinion was indeed as Aloisi had said, and the committee no longer had any hope of mediation. The British cabinet is scheduled to hold its first plenary meeting since August 22 today. The Times commented on this matter, saying that it would be better not to support the League of Nations than to let the efforts to uphold the League Covenant fail today. If the means of reconciliation or the determination to resist violence pursued by those committed to peace are sacrificed in order to seek the easiest and cheapest way to get rid of difficulties, then it is truly beyond imagination. A Reuters special correspondent in Addis Ababa telegraphed a statement made by a well-known medical expert in Abyssinia, who said that war could not occur for at least a month, because after the end of the rainy season, fevers and cholera would follow, and their momentum would be strong and spread in many places, and could not be eradicated until the end of October. It is said that Italian soldiers are already suffering from fever. Although medical experts say this, observers do not believe that Abyssinia can enjoy another month of peace, unless new efforts at reconciliation in Geneva can succeed quickly. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Carries Hoare's Letter; Visits Mussolini Again; Secret Talks Last About an Hour</h3>
<p>(Rome) British Foreign Secretary Hoare handed a private letter to the Italian Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, to be delivered to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Tonight, the British Ambassador visited the Italian Prime Minister and talked for about an hour, with no one else present. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Ambassador Drummond stated to Mussolini last night that Britain's policy has no anti-Italian inclination. However, the ambassador also told Mussolini that the British government intends to abide by the firm promises under the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Last night, British Ambassador to Italy Drummond personally delivered a private letter from British Foreign Secretary Hoare to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is said that the nature of the letter was to strengthen the British government's recent public statement regarding British naval actions. Reuters has learned that the letter has received a friendly reply from Mussolini. The London Observer believes that the public statement on British naval actions seems to have had a good effect, and the comments of the Italian newspapers today are more cautious than before, so they are all satisfied. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Announces: No Counter-Proposal Submitted; Response to League of Nations Action Depends on Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Cabinet held a meeting today to consider the League of Nations situation and the content of Mussolini's conversation with British Ambassador Drummond last night. A public statement was then issued stating that Italy only verbally stated its reasons for not accepting the five-nation special committee's suggestions, and did not submit a counter-proposal. Everything that has happened since Saturday and Sunday has shown that the Italian government's attitude cannot be regarded as variable. It is said that Mussolini mentioned in today's meeting that the situation has the possibility of developing according to some provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. The Italian government will respond depending on the situation. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Baldwin Convenes Full Cabinet Meeting; Decision Pending News from All Sides</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin met with several key cabinet members at 10 Downing Street yesterday to prepare for an important full cabinet meeting today to consider the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Baldwin talked with Lord President MacDonald, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Hoare, and Home Secretary Simon for about an hour in the morning.

With the exception of Eden, who is currently staying in Geneva, all cabinet members attended the meeting and maintained strict secrecy.

<h3>Five-Nation Committee's Report Nearly Complete; To Be Sent to League of Nations Council for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Italo-Abyssinian dispute subcommittee held a meeting this morning for two hours. At 12:30 PM, the report was drafted. Its contents include all relevant documents from various negotiations made by the committee since its establishment on September 6. It will be sent to the Council for discussion and the full text will be released this afternoon. The Council will not discuss this report before Thursday, the 26th of this month. The Council intends to know the results of the cabinet meetings held by the British and Italian cabinets today before the meeting. People in the League of Nations believe that there is little hope for substantial progress in the current situation before Thursday. The Council's primary task is to decide what procedures to adopt in the future. Those responsible believe that the procedural issue is secondary. What needs attention most is the future development of the situation, that is, how to deal with the threat of war. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The report of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute subcommittee submitted to the Council was completed this morning. Whether the Council will entrust the committee to draft new proposals will be added in Geneva soon. Optimists believe that the report submitted by the committee does not necessarily mean that mediation efforts have failed. Pessimists believe that the Council will actually handle the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. In other words, if Italy violates the obligations stipulated in paragraph 6 of this article, the League of Nations will take sanctions. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations rejected the request made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today. Therefore, Italy's first expression of compromise since the beginning of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has been unexpectedly rejected. The League of Nations Council will probably hold a meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss this deadlock. People here believe today that since the Five-Nation Committee has unanimously opposed Italy's request, the Council will probably not propose other solutions. It is expected that the Five-Nation Committee will recommend a subcommittee to draft a report with reference to Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. If the League of Nations implements this plan, then Italy's attack on Abyssinia will be completely an act of aggression, and member states should impose sanctions. On the Abyssinian side, because the Abyssinian Emperor notified the League of Nations that he accepted the proposal, his position is no longer in question. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations has resolved to abandon all hope of mediation. The chairman, Spanish representative Madariaga, announced today that the committee will meet tomorrow to draft a report summarizing the mediation process of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and delegate the responsibility for the second step of action to the member states. It is understood that the committee intends to publish all the documents of this dispute, including Abyssinia's notification of acceptance of the committee's proposal and Italy's notification of rejection. It is generally believed that this move will force Italy to bear the responsibility for rejecting reconciliation. Since the Five-Nation Committee has abandoned mediation, the entire problem must be resolved by the Council. The Council will also publish a report and propose peace proposals. If Abyssinia accepts the League of Nations' final proposal and Italy still rejects it, then the League of Nations will consider Italy's war against Abyssinia to be illegal. According to the League of Nations Covenant, all member states should help Abyssinia. People here today feel deeply that if Italy does start a war, there is a special intention to impose sanctions. When the Five-Nation Committee met today, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval criticized Italy's attitude in the capacity of spokesmen for Britain and France, which is noteworthy. Chairman Madariaga asked Italian representative Aloisi whether the proposal put forward by Italy on Sunday was Italy's minimum formal demand. It is said that Aloisi admitted that it was indeed a formal proposal, but it is not yet known whether he said it was the minimum demand. According to Aloisi's answer, if it is true, it conflicts with the statement of the Italian Foreign Ministry spokesperson. The Roman side denied that Italy had submitted a counter-proposal to the Five-Nation Committee. According to news from Addis Ababa, the Abyssinian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that if Italy had this proposal, it would be "incredible," and that it would be ridiculous to control the Abyssinian army with Italians.

<h3>League of Nations Council To Reconvene Tomorrow to Discuss Committee Report</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council will consider the Five-Nation Special Committee's report on Thursday. The committee only completed its work of drafting a comprehensive situation report based on official documents today. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to inquiries from Havas' diplomatic correspondent, the future of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute seems very bleak, because the League of Nations Council can no longer make concessions to Italy. When the Council meets tomorrow, it will probably take up the Five-Nation Subcommittee's report on the failure of reconciliation procedures and publish this report so that it can be judged by world opinion. As for whether there is still room for adopting the mediation procedures stipulated in Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, it should also be decided by the Council. But in any case, the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant regarding sanctions cannot be adopted before Italy implements its attack on Abyssinia. Therefore, although mediation has failed, there is still a period of hesitation before Italy starts a war against Abyssinia, and diplomats can still take advantage of this last five minutes to seek a peaceful resolution. This is the only hope for people here. In addition, people from the League of Nations also believe that there is no room for the Five-Nation Subcommittee to continue the mediation process, because since the Three-Nation Conference in Paris, Italy's tone in negotiations has slightly softened, but its fundamental attitude has not changed. If the subcommittee does not follow Italy's wishes, all suggestions will inevitably be rejected by Italy. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Original Text of Five-Nation Committee's Mediation Report To Be Released in Geneva, Divided Into Five Parts</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The original text of the Five-Nation Committee's suggestions was released this afternoon, with a total of five major parts. The first part outlines the current situation and the scope of the committee's work. The second part contains several suggestions for reforming Abyssinia. The third part details the implementation of this reform plan. The fourth and fifth parts put forward concrete suggestions for resolving disputes. The first part of the original text states that the committee seeks a basis for negotiations that meets the following conditions: (1) The independence and territorial integrity of the member states; (2) Friendly relations between the member states. It then describes the speech of the Abyssinian representative at the League of Nations Assembly, which stated that Abyssinia is willing to discuss in good faith various suggestions for developing the country's economy, politics, and finance in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>The second and third parts suggest reforming the following administrative organs: (1) Police; (2) Industry and commerce; (3) Finance; (4) Justice, education, and others. Foreign experts should reform the police administration. The first task of the police is to implement the prohibition of slavery management, carry firearms, and protect the safety of European residences and border areas. Under the outline of economic development, it lists the granting of farming rights and mining rights, the granting of trade rights, and the reform of postal and telecommunications. The financial recommendations include the preparation of budgets, the control of finance, and the study of foreign debt issues. In order to implement this reform, a central bureau should be established. All heads of administrative departments should belong to it. The heads of administrative departments should be foreigners, one of whom is a representative of the League of Nations. The heads of administrative departments should be subject to the control of the administrative commissioner. The administrative commissioner will be the representative of the League of Nations sent to Abyssinia. The last two parts stipulate that the League of Nations special representative should submit a report to the League of Nations at least once a year, and should solicit the opinions of the Abyssinian Emperor beforehand so that the Abyssinian government can add its opinions. The effective period of this plan is five years, and it can be revised based on the experience of the five years. The report then states that the representatives of Britain and France have notified the committee that the two governments are willing to participate in the demarcation of the Italo-Abyssinian border in order to promote the reconciliation of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and are willing to sacrifice the Somalian coast if necessary to compensate Abyssinia's losses. During the negotiations, the British and French governments will also try to make Abyssinia guarantee the prohibition of the slave system and the arms trade, and are willing to grant Italy special interests in developing Abyssinia's ports. Therefore, the two countries are welcome to sign an economic agreement, but this agreement should respect the rights granted to Britain and France by the people of both countries and existing treaties.

<h3>Sanctions Issue; Britain and France Still Negotiating; Laval Met with Eden Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Since arriving here, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval held talks with representatives of various countries this evening. It is said that what Laval is currently discussing is not only the Abyssinian incident, but also the entire European issue. According to reports, French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin asked the British government a few days ago, saying that since Britain is taking a firm attitude in Geneva on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, if Central Europe, especially Austria, is invaded in the future, will Britain take the same firm attitude? Regarding this, the British government has not yet replied. This time Laval came to Geneva again, and British Minister without Portfolio Eden may notify Laval of this reply. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to newspapers here, France's inquiry into Britain's future attitude towards the violation of the League of Nations Covenant by several European countries has become the material for yesterday's talks between Sir Eden and Prime Minister Laval. The two especially considered the issues of signing the Eastern European Pact and guaranteeing Austria's independence. The Daily Telegraph said that Eden told Laval that the British government is prepared to sign most conventions, guaranteeing that Britain and France will continue to actively cooperate in Europe. Eden also said that although there have been many mistakes in British foreign policy in the past few years, recent events have made Britain realize the need to implement a collective security system in both Europe and Africa, so Britain is prepared to undertake this far-reaching obligation.

<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>It seems quite bleak about the prospect before the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia because the Council of the League of Nations is in no position to make any concessions to Italy now. When the Council meets tomorrow, it shall likely take up the reports on the failure of conciliation procedures of the sub-committee composed of five countries, and this set of reports shall be made public for judgment by world opinion. Whether the conciliation procedures as specified in Article 15 of the League's Covenant are worthy of further adoption is up to the Council to decide as well. But, whatever, the provisions of Article 16 on sanctions under the Covenant cannot be adopted before Italy carries out an attack on Ethiopia. Consequently, even though the conciliation has failed, there are still some periods of hesitation before Italy starts the war against Ethiopia, and diplomats may still take advantage of these final five minutes for the sake of seeking a peaceful solution. It is only this to which ordinary people here hope. Besides, people from the League of Nations also consider that the sub-committee composed of five countries has no more room to continue with the conciliation procedure, because since the conference of the three countries in Paris, Italy's language in negotiations has been slightly toned down, while the fundamental attitude has not changed. Unless the sub-committee follows Italy's wish, all suggestions will be inevitably rejected by Italy. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Original Report on the Conciliation by the Five-Nation Committee, To Be Published in Geneva, Altogether Five Parts</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The original text of the recommendations of the Five-Nation Committee has been published this afternoon. The content is divided into five major parts. The first part outlines the current situation and the scope of the Committee's work. The second part contains several suggestions for reforming Ethiopia. The third part details the implementation rules of this set of reform plans. The fourth and fifth parts put forward specific suggestions for resolving the dispute. The first part of the original text stated that the committee is trying to find a basis for negotiation that meets the following conditions: (1) the independence and territorial integrity of each member state; (2) friendly relations among the member states. Continuing to outline the speech by a representative from Ethiopia present at the League's General Assembly, it said that Ethiopia is willing to discuss in good faith all kinds of suggestions on developing the country's economy, politics and finance, so as to align with the spirit of the League's Covenant.</p>
<p>The second and third parts suggest reforming the following administration organs: (1) the police, (2) industries and businesses, (3) finance, (4) the judiciary, education, and others. Foreign experts should reform police administration. The first task of the police is to implement the ban on the management of slavery, carrying of firearms, and protection of the safety of European residential areas and border areas. Under the outline of economic development, it lists the granting of cultivated lands and mining areas, the granting of trading rights, and the reforms to posts and telecommunications. The financial recommendations list the compiling of a budget, the control of finances, and the study of external debt issues. For the purpose of implementing this reform, a central bureau should be established. The heads of all administrative departments all belong to it. The heads of all administrative departments should be taken by foreigners, among whom one person is a representative of the League of Nations. The heads of each administrative department should be subject to the control of an administration commissioner, and the administration commissioner will be the representative assigned by the League of Nations to Ethiopia. The last two parts stipulate that the special representative of the League of Nations should submit a report to the League of Nations at least once a year, and should solicit the opinions of the Ethiopian Emperor beforehand so that the Ethiopian government can supplement with its opinions. The effective period of this plan is five years, after which it is open to amend it based on the experience in the five years. The report continues saying that the representatives from the United Kingdom and France have notified the Committee, saying that the two countries' governments are willing to participate in border-setting work between Italy and Ethiopia in order to facilitate a reconciliation of the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, and if meeting with the necessary, they are also willing to sacrifice coastal land from Somaliland to compensate for the losses of Ethiopia. In the process of the negotiations, the United Kingdom and France will also try to make Ethiopia guarantee to eliminate the system of slavery and arms trade, and are willing to cede the unusual interest in developing Ethiopia's harbors to Italy, therefore the two countries are welcomed to sign an agreement on economy. However, this agreement should respect the rights granted to the people of the two countries and existing treaties from the United Kingdom and France. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Issue of Sanctions; The United Kingdom and France Still Negotiating; Laval Again Meets Eden Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Ever since French Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Laval came here, he held dialogues with representatives from various countries this evening. It is said that what Laval is currently discussing is not merely the Abyssinia incident, but he also takes into account the entire issue on Europe. According to what the French ambassador in the United Kingdom, Corbin, has inquired of the British government some days ago, he said that since the United Kingdom is taking a resolute attitude in Geneva with respect to the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, if the countries in Central Europe, especially Austria, are offended in the future, would the United Kingdom take the same resolute attitude? About this layer, the British government has yet to respond. This time, when Laval comes to Geneva again, British Minister without Portfolio Eden may inform Laval of this response. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to what the newspapers here report, France is inquiring about the attitude of the United Kingdom towards several European countries' destruction of the League's Covenant in the future, and this has become the material for the dialogue between Sir Eden and Prime Minister Laval yesterday. The two especially considered the issue of signing the Eastern European Convention and safeguarding the independence of Austria. The Daily Telegraph says that Eden had informed Laval, saying that the British government is ready to sign the majority of conventions, guaranteeing that the United Kingdom and France will continue actively cooperating in Europe. Eden also says that even though there have been many mistakes in the diplomatic policies of the United Kingdom for the past several years, recent events have allowed the United Kingdom to understand the necessity of implementing a collective security system in both Europe and Africa, so the United Kingdom is ready to bear a long-term obligation on this side.

<h3>Mockery of Italians: Conspiracy to Help Abdicated King Escape</h3>
<p>Ajing: The person in the world most feared by the current Emperor Selassie is the imprisoned abdicated King Iyasu. Recently, there have been rumors of an Italian conspiracy to help him escape, so surveillance has been tightened. Iyasu is the grandson of Emperor Menelik, who defeated the Italian army at Adwa. In 1916, Menelik's daughter, Zewditu, with the support of the current king, usurped the throne from her brother and became empress. After her death, the current king succeeded to the throne and imprisoned Iyasu, where he has been for twelve years. The prison is located in a mountaintop fortress near Harar, with steep cliffs that are difficult to climb. Iyasu has the title of "King of Kings" and is highly revered by Muslims, making him potentially useful to the Italians. However, freeing him from captivity would be extremely difficult. It is said that Iyasu and the guards are bound together by a strong gold chain, so any movement can be detected. The guards have been warned that if the prisoner escapes, they will all face the death penalty. The warden is Abba Hanna, a trusted clergyman of the King, known for his skill in divination. The fortress is surrounded by impenetrable stone walls, with barbed wire fences and alarm bells. Three hundred armed guards patrol at night, assisted by trained police dogs. The King has ordered that Iyasu be treated well and has authorized Abba Hanna to draw funds from the national treasury to meet his needs. The prison furnishings are very exquisite, with various wines, delicacies, a hand-cranked organ, and various books and magazines are provided. He is also allowed female companionship and is "allowed to stroll on the prison lawn under guard." (Reuter Telegram from the North-China Daily News, September 22)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Borah Advocates Strict Neutrality and Distrusts Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>Boise, USA: Senator Borah delivered a speech to a large crowd here tonight, stating that the United States should be vigilant to avoid being drawn into a European war. The American people unanimously support international peace, but we now understand that Europe still has many important interests that have little to do with the United States. If war breaks out in Europe, many forces will draw the United States into the vortex. Therefore, we should always be vigilant. Britain is now launching a new propaganda campaign in the United States, believing that if Britain is threatened, democracy and world peace are threatened. But we must recognize that their views are only to safeguard their interests. Borah's speech represents the prevailing independent policy in the United States today.

<h3>American War Veterans Hold Annual Convention</h3>
<p>St. Louis: 250,000 American war veterans opened their annual convention here today, lasting four days.

<h3>U.S. Controls Munitions: Plans to Establish a Licensing System for Management; Committee Held First Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Washington) The National Munitions Inspection Committee, organized by the State Department in accordance with the wartime neutrality law, is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. Secretary of State Hull recently stated that he could not specify the decisions that the committee could make, but the State Department is eager to establish a licensing system to effectively monitor the manufacture and sale of munitions. Well-informed sources believe that when war breaks out in the future, the list of prohibited exports of various military equipment will be consistent with that proposed by U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland Wilson at the League of Nations Disarmament Conference in Geneva last November, or may even include some raw materials. In short, American public opinion will have a decisive influence on how the list of embargoed items should be formulated. (According to the draft treaty restricting the arms trade submitted by the U.S. representative to the League of Nations Disarmament Conference last November, armaments are divided into five categories: Category 1 includes munitions for land, sea, and air warfare; Category 2 includes naval armaments; Category 3 includes air armaments; Category 4 includes military and non-military ammunition; Category 5 includes ammunition for non-military use but can also be specifically used for military purposes.)

<h3>Emperor of Abyssinia Releases Prisoners for Military Service</h3>
<p>Ajing: The Emperor of Abyssinia has issued a decree releasing prisoners, except for murderers, who volunteer for military service. This move will increase the Abyssinian army by 50,000 men. Many fugitives have also been pardoned, many of whom are brave and have a good record in battle. However, this move by the King also has drawbacks as army commanders now have to implement very strict plans to prevent looting. Hundreds of prisoners have joined Corro's army, totaling 1000 soldiers who have plotted to steal livestock from farmers. Local police are now on high alert. A Reuters reporter has learned from reliable sources that Abyssinia can now mobilize slightly over one million men, but not all of them have rifles. (Reuters Telegram, September 24)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Hengyuan Factory to Resume Production, Managed by Bank Consortium</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the Hengyuan Yarn Factory was taken over and managed by the creditor banks China, Central, Jin City, and Continental, which organized a creditor group based on their creditor status, Zeng Xiangxi, the manager of Shanghai Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 7, was hired to serve as the representative in Tianjin and stationed at the factory to implement management. Preparations began a month ago. Improvements to technology, repairs to machinery, renovation of houses, and addition of new machines are nearing completion. The newly purchased German Escher Wyss factory and Japanese Toyoda textile machinery parts, totaling 60 horsepower, have arrived in Tianjin and are being installed. The newly ordered 400 Escher Wyss looms are on their way and are expected to arrive in Tianjin next month. The factory has been shut down for nearly a year, and more than 2,700 workers have lost their jobs. Some have been forced by poverty to become thieves, adding to social unrest. The resumption of work will have a positive impact on society directly and indirectly. In order to thoroughly reform and increase work efficiency, the factory has hired Li Rongguang, Zeng Ze, and Wan Chengzhi, graduates of the Tokyo Higher Institute of Technology, to manage the yarn spinning, machinery, and electrical departments, respectively. All operations will be modernized, with electric motors converted to small motors. The factory will only employ 1,500 workers, and some female workers will be used because female workers are more patient, meticulous, and can increase work efficiency. Workers from the Shanghai Shenxin Yarn Factory will be transferred north to work when necessary. When the original 1,700 workers were laid off, an agreement was signed stating that the factory must give priority to hiring the old workers whenever the factory resumes production. The matter was filed with the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau. Therefore, although the factory intends to eliminate some old workers, it is difficult to announce due to concerns about causing unexpected incidents. The resumption date is scheduled for the end of October, when new cotton becomes available.</p>
<p>After the Hengyuan factory resumes production, Tianjin's industry will add some new vitality. Three of the six major yarn factories in North China remain, and they will not be completely monopolized and absorbed by Japanese yarn. The scale of the Yuyuan Yarn Factory was originally the largest of the six major yarn factories. It shut down this spring, owing 6 million in foreign debt, especially to Japanese creditors. Shareholders' meetings were held repeatedly, and it was decided to liquidate the factory, sell the entire factory to repay the old debts, raise new capital, or reorganize a new shareholders' meeting to take over the factory and borrow capital from the bank consortium to resume operations. The Economic Commission may assist with valuation. However, although the liquidation has been completed, there is no capital for resumption, and no arrangements have been made to offset the old debts. The person in charge of the factory is in Shanghai negotiating with the banking community, but has not yet made any progress. The banking community believes that the factory cannot repay its previous debts, and its production equipment cannot offset the debts. Since North China's yarn factories have been affected by Japanese yarn, even if they are restored, it will be difficult to compete. It is dangerous to invest in loans, so they are reluctant to help Yuyuan resume operations. The resumption of the Hengyuan Yarn Factory is an attempt by the banking community to provide assistance to industry. If it is effective, it may be further extended to Yuyuan. (20th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Eastern Defense Army Searches and Suppresses Bandits on the Guangdong-Fujian Border, Raoping Attacks Security Team for Four Nights, Yang Battalion Captures Fake Team Leader and Secretary</h3>
<p>The bandits on the Guangdong-Fujian border have been appearing and disappearing unpredictably recently. Raoping County, Guangdong Province, which borders Fujian, has recently discovered bandits. The county's security team and defense army have stepped up suppression. However, on the evening of the 2nd of this month, dozens of bandits with dozens of rifles and pistols were discovered in Ganyu Village, Twelfth Pai, Wuzhi Township, District 5 of the county, attempting to attack the second squad of the security team stationed in the Qiushi Ancestral Hall in the village. Fortunately, they were discovered by a sentry, who immediately sounded the gong to gather the crowd and pursue them separately. The bandits resisted by fighting and retreating, throwing hand grenades. When the main force of the military police arrived to encircle and suppress them, the bandits had already fled far away. The Zeng Youren Brigade of the First Independent Division stationed in Raoping believed that the bandits were rampant and immediately dispatched Battalion Commander Yang to lead his troops to search the bandit area. On the 9th of the month, Battalion Commander Yang led the entire battalion in six routes to encircle Phoenix Mountain, burning several bandit strongholds in the Qiaokeng mountain forest, killing more than 30 bandits, and capturing the local bandit secretary and finance chief, who were executed on the spot and their heads were displayed to the public. On the evening of the 20th, at about 11 pm, Battalion Commander Yang received a report from the gentry that the bandits in Dashan had recently established a secret agency in Jiaoshuikeng, plotting wrongdoing. Battalion Commander Yang dispatched a team to suppress them. When they arrived at the destination, it was already the third watch of the night. They found lights in the forest, knowing it was a bandit secret cave. They sent troops to charge forward and encircle and suppress them in separate routes. The bandits also resisted stubbornly, and the gunshots shook the valley. After about half an hour of confrontation, the bandits ran out of ammunition and fled, abandoning their weapons. However, the mountains were deep and the forests were lush, and the intersections were numerous. The defense army was afraid of being tricked by the bandits and did not pursue them deeply. They simply set the bandit agency on fire. Before long, the east was already white. They began to search separately, finding five bandit corpses outside the agency gate. After searching in the deep forest, they captured two bandits alive. One, surnamed Liu, was the fake detachment leader of the bandits, and the other, surnamed Chen, was the detachment secretary of the bandits. They were immediately escorted back to the battalion headquarters and transferred to the brigade headquarters for interrogation. (September 19)</p>

<p>Wuxi: The Zhenxin Dispute Fully Resolved</p>
<p>The Zhenxin Yarn Factory labor-management dispute had reached an impasse due to both sides taking extreme positions. Subsequently, Provincial Party Committee member Pan Guojun came to Wuxi to investigate the truth. He consulted with the County Party Committee, the county government, and the Chamber of Commerce. As factory manager Jiang Zhexian was ill in Shanghai, he immediately arranged for County Party Committee member Sun Xiangfeng, Chamber of Commerce executive committee member Sun Qing, Director of the Chengxi Social Service Center Tang Pu'an, Textile Industry Association member Xue Mingjian, and others to go to Shanghai. They repeatedly and earnestly consulted with Zhenxin manager Jiang Zhexian, staff member Shao Chun, Li Yunhou of the Shanghai Bank, Tan Senshou of the Wuxi branch, and others. It was decided that Zhenxin would raise 5,300 yuan for worker savings deposits and 3,000 yuan for worker bonuses, to be handed over to the Chamber of Commerce for distribution by the County Party Committee. The August salaries owed to staff would be resolved by the factory itself. As there was a concrete solution, Committee member Pan and others returned to Wuxi the night before last to report to County Magistrate Wang. All staff and workers have agreed to the arrangement. The total amount of 8,300 yuan in worker funds was sent to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday for immediate distribution. The August salaries owed to staff have also been paid. Thus, the factory's labor unrest has been fully resolved. It is reported that the internal management has also reached an agreement with the Shanghai Bank, and work is expected to resume soon.

<h3>Amidst the Decline of All Industries, the Silk Industry Suddenly Becomes Active; Due to a Sharp Increase in Demand from Europe and America, the Prices of Cocoons, Silk, and Satin All Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, while all industries are in decline, the silk industry has suddenly shown signs of prosperity. Due to a sharp increase in demand from Europe and America, the price of raw silk has soared overseas. According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, Shanghai's raw silk exports were 3,588 bales in June, increased to 5,800 bales in July, and further increased to 6,981 bales in August, an increase of about one time compared to June. The market price of high-quality Shanghai white factory silk in August was 580 yuan per picul, and the market price of high-quality Sichuan yellow factory silk was 460 yuan, an increase of 14% and 21% respectively compared to 510 yuan for factory silk and 380 yuan for yellow factory silk in July. With the brisk sales of silk and the depletion of silk inventories, various silk factories have increased production, requiring a large number of cocoons, and the price of cocoons has risen sharply. The market price per picul has risen from 72 yuan in July to 85 yuan this month. The export of waste silk is also quite prosperous, with 1,210 bales in June, 1,714 bales in July, and a further increase to 2,467 bales last month, an increase of more than double compared to June. The market prices of silk and crepe have also risen accordingly.</p>

<h3>A Dispute Arises Over the Mortgage of the Jinxing Mansion; The Banking and Money Industries Decide to Assist Various Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the economic downturn has dealt a fatal blow to Shanghai's real estate developers, and this is another concrete proof. The Jinxing Real Estate Company, founded and operated by the famous real estate developer Sun Chunsheng, has recently caused a dispute between Chinese, British, and Japanese businessmen over the mortgage of its Jinxing Mansion at the end of its resources. According to investigations by reporters from the Central News Agency:</p>
<p>7 Million Yuan Mortgaged Over the Years</p>
<p>The Jinxing Mansion, owned by Jinxing Real Estate Company, has been mortgaged over the years to the Central Trust Company, Yisheng, Xinfu, Henglong, Hongsheng, Shenyuan, Tongqing, and other money shops for a total of 7 million yuan. Last year, when real estate prices in Shanghai fell, the company stopped paying interest. In order to protect the debt, the creditors applied to the First Special District Court to have the rent of the mortgaged houses pre-emptively attached and ordered the tenants to pay the rent to the creditors for deposit with the court.</p>
<p>British and Japanese Businessmen Suddenly Start Collecting Rent</p>
<p>Then, the British business Yexing Real Estate Company came forward to forcibly collect rent, claiming that they had obtained a long-term lease right for the houses from Jinxing Real Estate Company. The Central Trust Company filed a lawsuit with the court based on the facts and submitted evidence proving the forgery of Yexing Company's lease. After the court rejected Yexing Company, a Japanese man named Okamoto Otoichi, using the name of Murakami Law Office, hired a Japanese person to come forward to forcibly collect rent, claiming that Yexing had mortgaged the long-term lease from Jinxing to Okamoto for 800,000 yuan. The houses have now been assigned to Okamoto to collect rent. However, the tenants have seen through the scheme and are still legally submitting the rent to the banks and money shops designated by the court for safekeeping. At present, Yexing Company has already been rejected in the first instance, but has appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>The Banking and Money Industries Decide to Assist: In order to protect the legitimate rights of various banks and money shops, the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Association held a joint meeting of the banking and money industries at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss everything. Those who attended the meeting included Tang Zhimin, Hu Xian, Zhuang Dezhi, Qin Runqing, Xu Jiqing, Wang Boyuan, Lu Yunqing, Yi Zhizi, Jing Runshi, Wang Huaimi, Xi Jiming, Yu Zuoting, Wu Weiruru, Hu Bijiang, Bei Songsun, Qu Jigang, Ye Fuxiao, and others, totaling more than ten people. This case will affect the financial industry and they will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Memorial Submitted to the Ministry by the General Association of Merchant Ship Masters: Before the Establishment of a Maritime Court, Courts Handling Collision Cases Should Invite Maritime Experts for Consultation</h3>
<p>The General Association of Merchant Ship Masters has submitted a memorial to the Ministry of Transportation, requesting that the Ministry consult the Ministry of Justice. Before a maritime court is established, when courts hear ship-related cases, they should invite maritime experts to consult together to clarify responsibilities and avoid unjust imprisonments. It has been investigated that on the evening of April 22nd of this year, the Haizhou vessel of the China United Company, returning to Shanghai, encountered the Huang Youlan barge while entering the port near Lujiazui. The barge had no lights, did not heed warnings, and was operated by a drunken sailor who recklessly charged ahead, disregarding the danger. This left the Haizhou vessel with no room to maneuver in a navigationally challenging area. The barge continued to ram the Haizhou vessel, leading to the disaster where the cook, Liu Qi, tragically died due to excessive drinking. Both parties requested adjudication from the Shanghai Maritime Bureau's Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee. Simultaneously, Huang Youlan filed a criminal self-accusation with the court. When the committee made its adjudication, it deemed the responsibility to lie with the barge but, considering the death of the barge operator, suggested a slight compensation for relief. Therefore, the committee determined that the Haizhou vessel bore 30% of the responsibility for the compensation. The barge side, also aware of their fault, felt grateful for the relief they received. The case was closed, and the self-accusation was withdrawn from the court. However, the court, in hearing the case, disregarded the committee's adjudication and sentenced the captain of the Haizhou vessel, Zheng Runru, to imprisonment, which is extremely surprising. The reasoning behind the judgment was that there were lights on the mast of the barge, and the captain failed to notice them. The captain also failed to understand the ebb and flow of the tide, committing a negligent homicide in the course of duty, punishable by three years of imprisonment. Upon investigation, barges in the port of Shanghai do not have masts. How could lights be hung? Furthermore, Huang Youlan admitted to not having lights. What does the claim of lights on the mast refer to? The Haizhou vessel, entering the port against the tide during low tide, reduced its speed, adhering to the regulations for navigation. What is the basis for claiming a misunderstanding of the ebb and flow of the tide? It is clear that the boat owner is unjustly suffering a wrongful verdict. Our association believes that piloting ships is a specialized skill. In law, there are international navigation regulations, local navigational rules, and maritime law that constrain operations. Physically, there are influences such as wind, tides, weather, waterway changes, inertia, and the speed and maneuverability of the machinery and rudder. The primary aim of investigating ship collisions is to determine responsibility. However, responsibility is not solely based on the party suffering damage. Sometimes, even if a boat capsizes and people die, the party may still bear responsibility for causing the accident. Therefore, investigating ship collision cases requires someone with profound maritime experience to competently fulfill the role. This is why advanced maritime nations have maritime courts. Although the establishment of a maritime court in our country has been approved by the administrative conference, it has not yet been established. While your ministry has designated the organization of ship collision dispute resolution committees in various port maritime bureaus, parties involved can still file lawsuits with the court. Judges, lacking maritime expertise, openly make independent judgments, making it difficult to avoid wrongful verdicts and unjust imprisonments. If this continues without remedial measures, cases like that of Captain Qin will become commonplace. Sailors will feel a sense of shared grief and view the helm with fear,不敢問津矣. Considering that your ministry is the central authority for our sailors, it should devise comprehensive strategies to protect the legal rights of sailors. Therefore, we jointly submit this memorial to your ministry, requesting that you swiftly establish a maritime court as a fundamental solution. Additionally, we request that you consult the Ministry of Justice to ensure that, before a maritime court is established, courts handling ship-related cases invite several maritime experts who have served as captains for three or more years to consult together as a temporary remedy. We also request that you forward this request to the Ministry of Justice, ordering the High Court to invite experts to jointly hear the appeal of Zheng Runru's case to redress the injustice. Implementing this would be a virtuous act. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Transportation.</p>

<h3>First Batch of Autumn Cocoons from Jiangsu Province: Over a Thousand Loads Arrived Yesterday; Total Yield Estimated at Over Fifty Thousand Loads</h3>
<p>After the autumn cocoons matured in areas such as Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, over ten silk factories in this city, including Jincheng, Youli, Baotai, and Fuxing, went to collect the cocoons and have now completed their task. Yesterday, Mr. Pu Xin-kuan of the Jincheng Silk Factory told a reporter from the Shih Yeh Pao that the cocoon harvest in the Wuxi area this autumn was slightly better than in Zhejiang Province but only half of the spring cocoon harvest. It is estimated that the autumn cocoon yield is only over 100,000 loads, with 70-80% already collected by local manufacturers, leaving only 20-30% purchased by manufacturers in this city. The purchase price is around 22 yuan per load. Because of the significant wastage during silk reeling (over 400 catties of dry cocoons yield one load of silk), the factory can barely cover expenses and has no profit to gain. The supply of dry cocoon raw materials in Shanghai, including the 10-20% collected from Zhejiang, can only last until the beginning of December. After that, due to a lack of raw materials, factories will have to cease operations one after another. The reason for the insufficient supply of raw materials is that silk prices have been too low in recent years, and cocoon prices have plummeted, making it difficult for villagers to make a living. Therefore, they have collectively converted mulberry fields to grow grains. Due to the lack of raw materials for raising silkworms, the cocoon yield has also decreased significantly. Today, manufacturers transported over 1,000 loads of autumn cocoons from Wuxi and Changzhou to Shanghai, including over 200 loads from Jincheng, over 200 loads from Youli, over 400 loads from Fuxing, and over 200 loads from Baotai. Fresh cocoons from various regions will continue to be transported to Shanghai in batches for use.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Contribute to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces has been actively soliciting donations and receiving new and used clothing, shoes, and hats. Donations continue to pour in. Yesterday, Dai Gengxin donated 5,000 yuan on behalf of the China Hwa Cheng Tobacco Company, 1,000 yuan from employees of the China Hwa Cheng Tobacco Company, a joint donation of 500 yuan collected by the Yuanchu Charity Hall from various generous benefactors, 75 yuan from employees of Fuhe, 10 yuan from Zhang Lanxian's sister from the transfer of fruit profits, 20 yuan from a benefactor surnamed Yang, and a total of 184 yuan from ten individuals, including Wang Zhizhong, Lu Zhongshuai, and Deng Wenhai. The Bank of China received 20 yuan from employees of Qingdao Jiuhua, 10 yuan from Ye Yiqing, and 300 yuan from an anonymous donor on behalf of the Central Bank. The Chung Hwa Commercial &amp; Savings Bank received 460.21 yuan from the Tongyi Trust Company employees and 10 households including Ms. Liu Jingjuan and Jintai Yuanhang, 100 yuan from Lin Kanghou's birthday celebration (for disaster relief) , Yu Yuan Sheng, Zhang Yihuan, and Shen Changgeng. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank received 204.6 yuan from the Renhe Midwifery School. The Shanghai Bank received 382 yuan from seven households including an anonymous donor, Yunming, and Yingde Tang. Guo Gongguan donated 5 yuan. Funeral donations for disaster relief include 60 yuan from seven households including Bao Xingcha, Li Xutang, and Yao Zhigang. Furthermore, 15 households, including Yang Yanxin, Li Zhirong, Ms. Ye Sun, Su Dehuang, Lin Jiancheng, an anonymous donor from Wusong, and Chen Dihua, donated 680 pieces of used clothing, 60 pieces of shoes, socks, and hats, and cotton padding. This demonstrates the enthusiasm of all sectors in helping those affected by the disaster and benefiting the afflicted, for which their merits are immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Clarifies: Member Certificates Do Not Require Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Tianjin Customs Broker Association inquiring whether the new regulations stipulate that the member certificates of industry associations are exempt from stamp duty. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce immediately responded, stating that Article 16, Clause 28 of the Stamp Tax Law refers to certificates issued by competent government agencies to certify the identity or qualifications of individuals. Certificates issued to members by commercial organizations are not examples of competent government agencies certifying the identity or qualifications of individuals. Therefore, such certificates do not require stamp duty.</p>
<h3>Aviation Solicitation: Excellent Results from Each Brigade's Donation Collection</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Mobilization Office of the China Aviation Association commenced its first fundraising drive, brigade leaders and members have diligently worked to recruit members and solicit donations, achieving excellent results. Furthermore, donations are being collected from various trades based on the standard of operating revenue, including hotels, fresh meat, fresh pork retailers, brick and tile transportation, freight transport companies, gravel companies, dance halls, and yellow sand crushed stone operations. The results have been excellent, demonstrating the enthusiastic support from all sectors for the fundraising drive. The staff of the Dada Dance Hall has worked very hard in collection since formally opening on the 15th of last month. The donations collected have been sent to the Mobilization Office of the Commander-in-Chief for counting. To encourage dancers to contribute more enthusiastically and increase donations, the dance hall has decided to award prizes for aviation donations starting in October. The prizes will be donated by the dance hall.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Mobilization Office of the Commander-in-Chief received 1,867.85 yuan in membership fees and donations from Wang Peisun, principal of Nanyang Middle School and leader of the Sixth Brigade, 40 yuan in additional membership fees from Yang Meisan, leader of Brigade 201, 93.8 yuan in donations from Zhang Jingbai, leader of Brigade 208, 10 yuan in donations from Zhou Qi, leader of Brigade 175, and 12 yuan in membership fees from Tie Xuan, leader of Brigade 300.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Decide to Petition in Beijing: Requesting Revision of Stamp Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Guild believes that the newly promulgated stamp tax regulations, which require a stamp duty of two jiao for each bill of lading for ship cargo, have increased significantly from the original and deviate from the standard practice of tax levies. In some cases, the freight revenue for a single document is only 5 jiao, and after deducting customs declaration fees and commissions, the shipping company will have no income left after paying the stamp duty. Shipping companies had previously submitted a request to the Central Legislative Yuan to amend the regulations. As there has been no definite solution yet, shipping companies are finding it difficult to cope. Therefore, yesterday, the 5th Executive Committee meeting was convened to discuss the issue of stamp tax rates on ship bills of lading. As a result of the meeting, it was decided that the guild would draft a memorial and appoint Chu Zhiqing, chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Guild, standing committee member Yuan Yideng, and committee member Wang to petition the Legislative Yuan in Beijing. They will request that the new stamp tax rates for bills of lading be amended and new rates be set. Furthermore, regarding the previous resolution by the guild to suspend the collection of surcharges for the Wusong Merchant Marine School, the Ministry has replied, disapproving the suspension. This issue was also submitted to the Executive Committee for discussion. As a result, it was decided to continue the request and publicly appoint the chairman and the two standing committee members, Wang and Yuan, to clarify the situation to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Finance during their petition in Beijing. They will strive to achieve the goal of suspending the surcharges.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Police Inspection Group: Visits Public Concession Police Department Yesterday; Returns South by Ship Today</h3>
<p>The 13-member Guangdong Police Inspection Group, introduced by Mayor Wu, visited the Central Police Station of the Public Concession at 10:00 AM yesterday. Today at 10:00 AM, they will board the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan ship to return south. After arriving in Guangzhou, they will visit the Guangzhou Municipal Police Department and then prepare an inspection report on police administration in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Guangdong, and other cities to be submitted to the Guangdong Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Yuyao Salt Farmer Representatives Arrive in Shanghai: Make Various Requests for Assistance</h3>
<p>The Yuyao salt farmers have traditionally been able to negotiate fair prices for their salt with mountain merchants, who have exclusive rights to purchase and sell the salt. However, this spring, two major manufacturers from eastern and western Zhejiang established a salt merchant association in Hangzhou, forming an alliance to cut off salt purchases. The price was reduced from 8.4 jiao per dan to 6 jiao per dan, causing great hardship for the tens of thousands of salt farmers in the area. Subsequently, the Party and government authorities mediated, and both sides compromised, delaying the matter for two months. Fortunately, it was eventually determined that the annual salt price would be 8 jiao per dan, and the salt field office was notified to inform everyone. However, the merchants have been insincere in implementing this government order. They purchase the salt but do not pay for it, claiming that the market is sluggish and that they lack sufficient funds. All the factories have secretly formed an alliance and unanimously announced the suspension of salt purchases. Despite repeated negotiations by the salt farmers, no results have been achieved after three months. The salt barns are empty, livelihoods have been cut off, and suffering is immense. Instability is inevitable and is worsening daily. The Salt Farmers' Union held a meeting and, recognizing that the unresolved issue could harm local governance, specially dispatched over ten representatives from various districts to petition Party and government agencies and the Salt Transport Office in Zhejiang. On the 21st, over twenty salt farmers from various districts of the county, including Lu Chenghui, Shen Chengjiong, Yuan Gongqi, Yu Liyou, Shen Dayou, Xiang Xizhi, and Shen Bairong, arrived in Shanghai on behalf of over ten thousand salt farmers in the county. They presented a brief to the Ningbo Shaoxing fellow-countrymen associations and prominent figures in Shanghai, such as Yu Qiaqing and Song Hanzhang, requesting their support and assistance to save the lives of tens of thousands of people on the verge of starvation. The main points of the brief are: (1) urge the Salt Bureau to pay attention to the livelihood of salt farmers and local security; (2) order Wang Shoushan, general manager of Zhejiang West Yuantai Company and other salt merchants, and Gu, chairman of Zhejiang East Company, to expedite the purchase of the quota of salt and pay for it.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts in Tianmen by the Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society recently received a letter from Hou Ruide and Qian Xinru, the heads of the association's Tianmen County branch, reporting that they arrived in Tianmen on the 19th of this month with relief workers and designated Dongmen Diyan No. 2 as a temporary relief station. Their plan is to thoroughly investigate households in the most severely affected areas and provide tickets to the extremely poor to prevent corruption. If relief rice is needed, it can be purchased from nearby Jingmen and Yingcheng counties, where the price is cheaper. The Tianmen dou is larger than the Fancheng dou by two, so each dou can be increased by six sheng of the Hanhu dou. The price is approximately six yuan and two jiao per stone in Han currency. Broad beans cost two yuan and five jiao per shi, which is equivalent to one yuan and two jiao per Hanhu. They are currently conducting investigations. They have encountered disaster victims reporting that the flood has inundated all the surrounding villages and submerged the city, resulting in the drowning of approximately 200,000 people. Everywhere the directors went, disaster victims wailed and begged for relief, their cries shaking the heavens. Corpses littered the ground. They urgently request additional relief funds to save the remaining lives and prevent them from filling the ditches.</p>

<p>Guangdong Police Director Personally Presents an Inscription After Observing a Demonstration</p>
<p>Huang Zhendong, head of the Guangdong Provincial Government Police Inspection Group, led a delegation of two on a tour of Oxford, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other cities to inspect police administration. They arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, introduced by Mayor Wu Tiecheng, they visited various special zone police stations in the city for inspection and were very satisfied. Huang believes that mental science greatly benefits police administration and that all countries have already adopted it. The Chinese police also need to adopt this. In the afternoon, he visited the Chinese Mental Research Society at Anqing Road, Hess Road, in the city. Chen Jianfu, a professor at the society, and Xu Yiming, the director of the society, along with Yu Cangsong, Wang Baowu, and other staff members demonstrated the benefits of mental science in police work.

After the demonstration, he personally inscribed "Implementing the Omnipotence of Mental Science Greatly Benefits Police Administration" to the society as a memento. Before leaving, he requested that the society offer its mental training course to the government. He decided to report the materials obtained from the experiment to the police authorities for adoption. It is evident that the delegation's inspection was thorough, and it is expected that the delegation's inspections will lead to a new level of effectiveness in police administration.</p>

<h3>Three Businesses Announce Liquidation Due to Poor Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Renji Iron Works</p>
<p>The Renji Iron Works in the Southern City has been in business for over a decade. Its business has generally been quite good. At its peak, its annual turnover reached over 1 million yuan. Even in recent years of poor market conditions, it has had an annual turnover of several hundred thousand yuan. It is a large-scale operation and can be considered a giant in the Southern City's iron industry. However, due to the increasingly poor market conditions, it has become impossible to operate. Yesterday, it engaged accountants Jiang Wanping and lawyer Jiang Ping to declare bankruptcy and liquidation. The Hengchangcheng Iron Works in Wuxi, which it also operates, has also declared bankruptcy. A meeting of Renji creditors will be held in Shanghai on October 12th, and a meeting of Hengchangcheng creditors will be held in Wuxi on October 19th.</p>
<p>Shenchangxiang Store</p>
<p>The Hengchangxiang general store, located at No. 10, Lane 300, Guangdong Road, has been in business for many years and has generally been thriving. However, due to the impact of poor market conditions, it has accumulated debt and become unable to maintain its operations. Yesterday, it engaged lawyer Hou Wan'an to announce liquidation and invite creditors to register their claims within ten days. Failure to do so will be considered a voluntary waiver of rights. All outstanding debts must also be paid in full within the specified period.</p>
<p>Yanruiji Store</p>
<p>Lawyer Jin Zhizhi, representing the Yanruiji Gu Store, announced liquidation and notified creditors to register their claims within 14 days. Failure to do so will be considered a voluntary waiver of rights.</p>

<p>The Hua Hua Silk Company and Da Xin Silk Bureau, founded solely by Mr. Wang Yansong, a leader in Shanghai's business community, were previously located at the intersection of Third Ma Road and Shi Road. The scale was grand, and the business was thriving. Now, due to the original location being insufficient, a new location has been selected at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road for a scheduled relocation. It is now learned that the decoration project of the new location is nearing complete fruition. It is magnificent and presents a grand spectacle. The internal layout is particularly ingenious and unique. As for the goods supplied, all are the latest products, and they have been purchased completely, truly deserving to be called unparalleled. The majority of the nation's silk and satin products are stocked. The shop assistants are openly recruited by the Chinese United Vocational Education Association, and only after a lengthy period of extraordinary training are they assigned. Therefore, after the curtain rises in the future, not only will the quality and price of the goods create a sensation throughout Shanghai, but also the internal organization and personnel management will bring about timely innovation in the silk and satin industry.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association - Approved and Filed by the Party Headquarters - Notice of Membership Methods for Colleagues</h3>
<p>Since its official establishment, the Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association has held meetings to discuss detailed and concrete methods for improving the organization's affairs, such as improving the lives of members and developing their businesses. Regarding the proposal to change rickshaw wheels to use rubber tires, which is extremely important to the business, special attention has been paid to it. It is now learned that the Association has submitted a report to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for review and filing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Approved for Filing by the Party Headquarters</p>
<p>In order to ensure the soundness of the organization, in addition to strictly rectifying the internal affairs, the Association submitted a detailed report on the organization and the situation of the request to the Public Works Department to oppose the cessation of additional donations to the Municipal Party Headquarters to apply for filing.

<p>Membership for Colleagues</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Association announced to all colleagues in the city, "Colleagues in the rickshaw industry throughout the city, thanks to the united spirit of all colleagues, the issue of negotiating additional donations has finally been resolved satisfactorily, which is indeed a memorable event. However, observing the current environment, we cannot afford to be optimistic. We should know that in recent years, industry and commerce have been depressed, and everything is in decline. With scarce loans, business has plummeted. Furthermore, mechanical transportation, such as trucks, has occupied the market, and our hand-pulled rickshaws are facing a serious threat. This is the reality, and we cannot ignore it. To save the current crisis, we must rely on planning and concerted efforts. The birth of this Association is in response to this urgent need, hoping to achieve the goal of developing business through mutual aid and solidarity. Since its establishment, it has had some success in negotiating issues such as additional donations, which is well known to all colleagues. Now, this Association has been formally filed by the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters. In order to promote the universal unity of colleagues and protect business, the following methods are specially stipulated: (1) Membership application will be extended until the end of November this year. Within the above-mentioned period, all colleagues in the rickshaw industry may fill out a voluntary application form and apply for membership. (2) Those who have completed the membership procedures and obtained temporary membership certificates are requested to come to the Association on the 5th of next month to exchange their certificates for porcelain membership certificates (along with the payment of membership fees) for identification purposes. This matter concerns the vital interests of all colleagues, so please do not disregard it. This is a special announcement."</p>

<h3>Internationally Renowned Cultural Leader Nicholas Roerich Arrives in Shanghai - Roerich is an Artist, Writer, Antiquarian, and Philosopher Who Has Traveled Extensively in Central Asia and Mongolia in the Past Sixteen Months</h3>
<p>Yulin Daily reports: Professor Nicholas Roerich, an internationally renowned artist, writer, antiquarian, and philosopher, and one of the recognized world cultural leaders, arrived in Shanghai on Monday from Beijing. Roerich was commissioned by the United States Department of Agriculture to collect drought-resistant grass seeds from Mongolia and Tibet. According to Roerich, if the grass seeds found in the deserts can be transplanted to the United States, farmers will not have to worry about their hard work being ruined by the climate. In the past sixteen months, Roerich has traveled extensively in Central Asia and Mongolia, collecting three to four hundred kinds of grass specimens, hoping to use them to prevent the drought that plagues the midwestern states of the United States. Roerich traveled to India on the President Monroe on Tuesday, planning to finish his unfinished work in the Himalayas and then return to New York. Roerich is also skilled in art. The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York has thousands of his paintings, five hundred of which are related to Asia. The famous collector Anteliges once said, "Reading Roerich's paintings is like seeing a new world." Roerich has painted five hundred Himalayan mountain landscapes, which is truly commendable. Roerich has written many books on culture. His son, Dr. George Roerich, has traveled with him and has also written several books on Mongolia and Tibet. His recent work, a Tibetan-English dictionary, has not yet been published. During his stay in Shanghai, Roerich told a guest, "I am leaving China with the best feelings. I am very grateful for the kindness of the Chinese and Mongolian governments in helping me complete my cultural work." Roerich was born in 1874 in St. Petersburg, the former capital of Russia. He was both talented and eager to learn, so he enjoyed great fame in the world. After the Russian Revolution, he moved to the United States with his family in 1920.</p>
<h3>Robbery During a Night Walk with a Dance Partner - One Robber Shot Dead by a Plainclothes Detective - Zhu Zhujin Joyfully Takes a Dance Partner Home After Dancing, Two Robbers Intercept and Rob, One Flees Far Away, One Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhujin, a 26-year-old young man from Pudong, residing at No. 7, Yide Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi, works at the Shanghai Inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Bureau. Previously, he went to a dance hall on Jing'an Temple Road with his lover, Bu Nai Xin, a 22-year-old woman from Ningbo, to dance. At one o'clock yesterday morning, after enjoying themselves, the two left together to go home. Since the woman lived in the French Concession, Zhu walked with her to see her home, going from Xizang Road to the intersection of Songshan Road and Bo Pop Road in the French Concession. The two were walking and calling for rickshaws. As they walked in front of No. 414 Bo Pop Road, at exactly 1:30 AM, two robbers suddenly sprang out from the side of the road, one wearing a coffee-colored suit and the other a black gown, speaking in a local accent, and blocked their way. The robber in the suit showed a handgun and ordered Zhu and the woman to be quiet. The robber in the suit searched Zhu's suit pocket and took a five-yuan banknote from the Bank of China, one new silver dollar, and miscellaneous papers. The robber in the gown forcibly snatched a gold bracelet (worth 80 yuan) and a small rectangular chrome watch (worth 18 yuan) from Bu Nai Xin's hand. Zhu and the woman, seeing that the robbers had weapons, did not dare to resist and allowed them to search completely. The robbers ordered Zhu and the woman to return the way they came and not to look back. Zhu and the woman had no choice but to turn back and walk, and the robbers then strode away. Zhu and the woman walked for about three or five minutes and, knowing that the robbers had gone far, felt unwilling and turned back to chase after them, pursuing the shadows from about seven or eight zhang away. When they reached the intersection of Beile Road, they reported to the Chinese patrol officer No. 543 on duty there. The patrol officer immediately helped to pursue them and blew a whistle. The two robbers then scattered and fled. The robber in the suit turned north from Marang Road. As he approached Xiafei Road, Zhang Fengming, a plainclothes Chinese detective from Hebei from the Central Police Station, was heading home from work in a rickshaw. As he approached the intersection of Xiafei Road and Marang Road, he heard the noise, got out of the rickshaw, pulled out his handgun, and rushed to intercept them. Seeing the robber in the suit running towards him, Detective Zhang, holding his handgun, ordered him to stop. The robber, hearing the noise, immediately fired a shot to resist arrest. Detective Zhang dodged to the side and fired back, one bullet hitting the robber in the chest next to his right breast, and he fell to the ground. The robber fired another shot and then died, leaving behind a four-inch Browning handgun with five bullets still in the chamber. At this time, the victims and Chinese patrol officer No. 543 also arrived. Zhu recognized the robber who had robbed him. Detective Zhang immediately picked up the handgun and bullets and, with the help of rickshaw pullers Lu Afu (from Chongming) and Shi Sanrong (the bullet fired by the robber hit the shaft of his rickshaw), helped to carry the robber's body to the Xiafei Police Station and report the incident. The robber in the gown had already disappeared without a trace after the police station dispatched detectives to pursue him. The police chief ordered the robber's body to be taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. A wooden tag and a small knife were found on the body, as well as one yuan of the original stolen money. At 9:00 AM the next morning, Wang, the prosecutor from the Second Special Court, and Wei, the forensic doctor, and Peng, the clerk, arrived at the scene at noon to inspect the body. A bullet was extracted from the body. After the examination, they sat down to hear the case. Plainclothes detectives Zhang Quansheng and Zhang Fengming reported the incident and the investigation process in detail and presented the handgun, bullets, and confiscated items to the court. The victim, Wang Nai Xin, had not arrived, so Zhu Zhujin and the two rickshaw pullers, Lu and Shi, arrived to testify, describing the robbery and what they had witnessed. Zhu identified the silver dollar presented to the court as the stolen money. The official ordered the return of the silver dollar to Zhu and ruled that the unidentified man had died from a gunshot wound before his death. The body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to await identification by the family. The wooden tag and small knife were stored in the warehouse for collection. The handgun and five bullets were handed over to the detectives to investigate. The police department also ordered all detectives on duty to strictly investigate the fugitive robber and the stolen goods and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>He Xirui, Member of the Nanchang Air Force Team, Arrested in Shanghai - He is Originally from the Netherlands but is Considered to Have Lost His Citizenship - Nanchang Aviation Committee Believes He Xirui Has Engaged in Unlawful Conduct</h3>
<p>He Xirui, a 24-year-old member of the Nanchang Air Force's 1st Team, whose father is named He Deru, is originally from the Netherlands. After graduating from aviation school in China, he served as a photographer and pilot in the Air Force's 1st Team. A month ago, He took leave to return to Xiamen, Fujian, to handle his father's funeral. After the funeral, he came to Shanghai, staying in Room 405 of the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, the Nanchang Aviation Committee, having received reports that He was impersonating a public official and engaging in other misconduct at the Cangzhou Hotel, sent a document to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau ordering an investigation. Chief Cai found that He was currently residing in Room 405 of the Cangzhou Hotel and sent detectives Su Gengsheng and Yuan Haisan to the First Special District Court to request an arrest warrant. Together with Tang Zihong, the chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, they secretly went to the hotel at about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday and arrested He, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they escorted him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Court. Zhang Dayin, the police station's lawyer, stated that at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, a member of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau came to the police station with an arrest warrant from the court, requesting assistance in arresting He Xirui. However, after checking, He was found to be a Dutch citizen. Therefore, the police station was unsure whether the court's arrest warrant was valid for He and should first investigate with the Dutch Consulate whether He Xirui was registered there. Later, the Dutch Consul, Mr. Bell, verified the passport No. 9510 presented by He, proving that He was indeed a Dutch citizen. However, according to Mr. Bell's statement to the police station, according to Dutch law, any Dutch citizen who serves in another country without government permission is considered to have lost their citizenship. Since He had not obtained permission from the Dutch government, he should be considered to have lost his citizenship. The police station then went to the Cangzhou Hotel and arrested He. However, it is still unclear whether He's offense falls under criminal law or military law. A representative from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau told the police station that He had taken leave on July 9th of this year because someone in his family was ill and had not returned to work, which constituted desertion. However, the police station found a leave slip on He, with the leave period being from July 9th to October 9th, which seemed to be valid. According to the slip, the leave period had not yet expired. The representative requested instructions on how to proceed. Chen Guangyan, the captain of the Second Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, stated that He Xirui had previously made a mistake in his work and was detained by the Nanchang Aviation Committee. Later, He was granted leave due to his father's death. Now, based on reports that He had abused his authority and spread rumors, he was arrested under orders from above. However, the details are unknown and must be requested from above. When questioned, He Xirui stated that he had been in Shanghai for a month and had been ill for more than half of that time. Last time, he was detained for seven days for breaking glass in the team while drunk. This time, he took leave because of his father's death and came to Shanghai, staying at the Cangzhou Hotel, and did not abuse his authority or spread rumors. He requested that evidence be presented. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confession and ordered He to be detained for further questioning on October 1st.</p>

<h3>The United China Line's Mother You Steamer Will Sail Directly to Funing Tomorrow - A Distance of 300 Nautical Miles, Which Can Be Reached in 40 Hours, Stopping at Hexingzhen and Other Brands Along the Way</h3>
<p>The China United Wharf &amp; Warehouse Co. at 725 Wai Ma Road has opened a direct shipping route from Shanghai to Funing for the purpose of developing the planting industry in northern Jiangsu and facilitating commercial transport. The maiden voyage is scheduled for tomorrow. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Abundant Production, Inconvenient Transportation</p>
<p>Funing is an important county town in northern Jiangsu, and its production of cotton, grains, and other products is extremely abundant. In addition, the production of livestock such as pigs, chickens, and ducks is also considerable. However, there has been no direct shipping route between Funing and Shanghai. Local products are transported by small inland vessels and private ships to ports such as Tongzhou and then loaded onto ships to Shanghai, which often takes more than ten days. The time wasted and the losses incurred are self-evident.</p>
<p>Successful Trial Voyage via the Sheyang River</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Wharf &amp; Warehouse Co., recognizing that the existing route cannot reach Funing directly due to the danger of the entrance bar, which deters seagoing vessels from attempting it, sent Zhu Xinsheng, the head of the navigation department, on the Mother You Steamer to conduct a trial voyage via the Sheyang River on the 22nd of last month. It took only 40 hours to travel directly from Shanghai to Funing. The entire route is 300 nautical miles long.</p>
<p>Establishment of Offices in Important Ports</p>
<p>Yongxingji, 70 li from Funing, is also an important town. The Mother You Steamer sailed to that point at the time but stopped there because the water depth further upstream was less than 15 feet, making it difficult to navigate. The ship measured the route in detail and determined that it was possible to travel directly. Subsequently, offices were established in Sheyang River, Hexingzhen, Qianqiugang, Baojiadun, Wufangang, and Funing to facilitate stops along the way.</p>
<p>Official Direct Voyage to Funing Tomorrow</p>
<p>The company's Mother You Steamer has completed all the necessary arrangements along the route and is scheduled to officially sail to the newly opened Funing route tomorrow morning from Shanghai. The Datong News Agency reporter also learned that the Mother You Steamer is 230 feet long, 36 feet wide, has a draft of 8 feet when empty and 15 feet when fully loaded, has a capacity of 1,500 tons, and a speed of more than 10 nautical miles per hour. It is also learned that the captain of the ship is Shen Dafang and the first mate is Tang Beihang.</p>
<h3>The International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestically Produced Goods</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the bureau received several letters from abroad last week requesting domestically produced goods. They are listed below. It is hoped that manufacturers and exporters will request the bureau's guidance department to introduce them: (1) The Dutch Morley Iron Candy Biscuit Company intends to purchase various candies from China and requests instructions on everything. Goods can be financed by bank remittances. (2) The Dutch Almes Heiden City Wahlfu Jewelry Importer requests an introduction to jewelry, jade, gemstone, coral, and other jewelry manufacturers for trade. High-quality goods can be mailed, and payment will be made upon arrival. Commercial credit can be inquired at the Chinese Consulate in that city.</p>
<h3>American Employee of Da Lai Steamship Company Commits Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>Neither a Nervous Disorder Nor a Romantic Relationship, Only a Letter to Her Mother Saying She Could Not Cope With This World</p>
<p>The Greater America Evening News reports that Miss Dallas Brecht, an American employee of the Da Lai Steamship Company, committed suicide by shooting herself in the bathroom of her residence at No. 102, Lane 147, Hongqiao Road, this morning (the 24th). Her mother is currently on the President Jackson, coming to Shanghai from Seattle, and is expected to arrive next Tuesday. The deceased left a letter to her mother, only saying that she could no longer cope with this world, without explaining the reason for her suicide. Her friends are also unaware of the reason. The deceased was working in the company yesterday and seemed to be in good health. A friend spoke to her on the phone last night at 10:00 PM and did not hear her say anything pessimistic. It is reported that the deceased had dinner at home last night with a woman whose name is unknown. According to a mutual friend, the deceased had not been known to have any emotional turmoil. The deceased was 40 years old and had not yet married. Judging from the wording of her letter, there was no sign of a nervous disorder. Among her belongings, there was a promissory note for 1,000 yuan sent by her mother, dated June 25th, which had not yet been cashed. The deceased's mother is Canadian, and her father is German. Her mother lived in Shanghai for about 30 years and was very wealthy and well-known in Shanghai's social circles.</p>

<h3>After the Yongfeng Electric Factory Closed Down, Shareholders Filed a Lawsuit Accusing the General Manager and Others of Colluding in Fraud and Embezzling More Than 10,000 Yuan of Company Funds</h3>
<p>The Yongfeng Electric Manufacturing Factory, which has already closed down, was founded by Jiang Yinan and others as a joint venture, with Jiang serving as General Manager, Qi Zhou as Manager, Zhou Binghui as Engineer, and Jiang Hezhou (i.e., Jiang Chou) as Sales Director. Since starting operations in 1929, it failed after just six years. After the closure, shareholders Shen Weiqing, Zhao Kecheng, and Wu Zhuolun discovered that Jiang and others had colluded and engaged in fraudulent activities during their tenure, embezzling company funds totaling 100,241.288 yuan. They hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to file a criminal self-accusation against Jiang and Zhou for embezzlement and breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Gui of the First Special District District Court held a hearing. None of the four defendants appeared in court. Lawyers Yan Gang and Yan Qisheng appeared on their behalf and requested a postponement, citing that the defendants were mostly out of Shanghai on business and that the case involved complex Japanese matters, hindering them from preparing their defense. The court then questioned the plaintiff, Wu Zhuolun, about the basis of the lawsuit. Wu stated that the company had thirteen shareholders with a total of 296 shares. The three of them had each invested 500 yuan. The factory was located in Hongxing Lane on Beijing Road, specializing in the manufacture of flashlights. There was a partnership agreement in place at the time, but the defendants violated the terms of the agreement in all their actions during their tenure. It has now been discovered that the company's funds have been embezzled to the huge sum of over 100,000 yuan, and the defendants have not left Shanghai, but are actually avoiding appearing in court. Judge Liu therefore adjourned the hearing, pending the arrival of the defendants for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zheng Wencai Privately Sells Red Pills and Attempts to Frame Others, Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Zheng Wencai, from Qingjiang, has recently been selling red pills in the Pu'ai Alley near Zhoujia Bridge for profit. The day before yesterday at noon, he suddenly reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, claiming that he knew this kind of livelihood was against the law but was forced to do it by circumstances. He claimed the main perpetrator was Wang Xiaofeng, a fellow townsman, and his accomplice was Liu Wanning. He said the women who handed over the red pills were Ms. Wu, Ms. Guo, and Ms. Zhu, who could sell more than 500 pills a day and give him small change for food. Now, disregarding the consequences, he had revealed their business to Wang, but Wang refused to let him quit and threatened to kill him with an axe, so he made a special trip to turn himself in. He then produced a package of evidence, 120 poisonous pills. The police chief dispatched detective Zi Shouqi, who arrested Wang, Liu, and the three women at 40 Songpan Road, and took them into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Bureau of Public Works stated the circumstances and claimed that the defendants denied the charges at the police station. When Zheng Wencai, listed as the first defendant, gave his testimony, it was the same as what he had said at the police station. When Wang was questioned, he claimed to have known Zheng for years but had only borrowed a few silver dollars from him. He accused Zheng of making false accusations and asked the court to examine the red pills, claiming they were his own. He hired lawyer Yan Gang to defend him. Liu Wan wrote a statement similar to Wang's. Ms. Wang and the other two women stated that they never sold red pills. Judge Xiao Bianfen sentenced Zheng Wencai to six months in prison, the red pills were confiscated, and the other five defendants, including Wang Xiaofeng, were found not guilty. Lawyer Li dropped the appeal and released them.</p>

<h3>Flood Relief Association Negotiates with Radio Stations to Broadcast Begging Songs, Lyrics Edited and Printed by the Publishing Cooperative and Sent to Schools for Students to Sing</h3>
<p>The Flood Relief Association for various provinces received 200 copies of sheet music for "Begging Song" and "The Suffering of the Disaster Victims" edited and printed by the Shanghai Publishing Cooperative yesterday. They were distributed to the local education departments to forward to schools for students to sing, and personnel were sent to contact local broadcasting stations to broadcast the songs widely, so as to move the general public and facilitate fundraising. The lyrics of one song are recorded below: ("Begging Song") The autumn wind rises, the autumn clouds fly, fallen leaves flutter all over the ground. Looking into the distance, the sky is boundless, only seeing a single, lost, sorrowful swallow, hesitating and wandering, flying in all directions. Alas, they are displaced and have no fixed abode, no clothes to protect against the cold. Houses and fields are all submerged, family members are separated. They can only bitterly flee the famine for food, how can they avoid the wind and rain, body cold and stomach hungry, they are truly without clothes, food, help or support. ("The Suffering of the Disaster Victims") Sky connects to water, water connects to sky, the滔滔 flood is boundless. The banks are washed away without restraint, homes and villages are all flooded. When the water comes at night, there is no time to escape, the old and the young all become fish and turtles. Climbing trees and walls, they are fortunate to be spared, looking down at the vastness, their hearts are filled with sorrow.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read a news item in your newspaper's "Local News" column on the 23rd of this month entitled "The Baobingjia System Begins in This City", which is completely inconsistent with the facts. It is a fact that I was ordered to go to Nanjing this time to inspect the training of long-term police officers at the Capital Police Department and did not receive any other mission. I am afraid that Mr. Editor-in-Chief will have a great understanding. To the Editor: I am shocked to read in your newspaper's "Local News" column today that the Yue Merchants Shipping Company has purchased the Fudong ship of the Funing Shipping Company and opened a new Shanghai-Beihai route. It has been discovered that the Fudong ship was mortgaged by the Funing Shipping Company to our bank. This time, the company declared liquidation and handed over the Fudong, Funan, and Fuxi ships to our bank as compensation for the company's debt to our bank. The Fudong ship is now being repaired by our bank at its own expense and is sailing to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beihai, Haikou, and other ports in cooperation with the Shanghai Yue Merchants Shipping Company, and is not purchased by the Yue Merchants. I am writing this special letter to inform you and ask you to correct it to conform to the facts. To the beginning of public friendship, I wish you all the best. September 21, 1935.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Concerning Suggestions on Increasing Negotiable Instruments (4)</h3>
<p>5.  Deficiencies in the Financial System</p>
<p>Although the loss of negotiable instruments used for payment is substantial, it has not yet reached a state of depletion, as mentioned above. However, why is it that the payment of negotiable instruments has not been depleted, while financial turnover has become extremely difficult? This must be further attributed to the deficiencies in the financial system. In Shanghai over the past decade or so, the old financial system has gradually collapsed, while a new financial system has not yet been established. The dynamics of financial circulation are merely a disorderly, unplanned pouring-in, rather than a systematic cycle. In normal times, when credit is loose, investments and loans are made independently, each acting on its own, which easily leads to excessive credit expansion. Once a crisis suddenly arises, everyone panics, tightening credit severely, resulting in an unwarranted credit crunch. In the current situation, if the financial industry could provide its strength, market panic could be alleviated almost overnight. However, the financial industry's inability to do so readily has its own difficulties. Namely, after the financial industry extends credit to industry and commerce, who can then extend credit to the financial industry? If there is no backing, the financial industry's own lack of funds would not be a blessing for the country. To solve these two problems, we must actively improve the financial organization, creating a great financial center force to serve as the backing for the financial industry and the hub for financial turnover, so that the financial organization itself can first achieve systematic circulation. Passively, we must also prevent the currency in this circulation from flowing out in large quantities due to the inability to balance international payments. Only in this way can the financial industry complete its organic circulation and fulfill its due role in the national economic system. However, to achieve this goal, the full utilization of credit instruments is essential. Details will be discussed below.</p>
<p>6.  Modern Credit Instruments</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the improper use of credit instruments is the biggest deficiency in the current financial system. Payment instruments are like power, while credit instruments are like machinery. Without power, machinery cannot operate, but without sufficient machinery, power is wasted without benefiting production. Therefore, if the use of credit instruments is not vigorously promoted, even if we import foreign capital or even inflate the currency, the result will only fuel speculation and abnormal economic development.</p>
<p>The main credit instruments in modern financial markets are twofold: one is industrial securities, including stocks and corporate bonds; the other is negotiable instruments, typically bank acceptances and commercial acceptances. The issuance and trading of industrial securities create a long-term capital market in the financial system, with the stock exchange as its representative institution. Industrial and commercial enterprises use this to obtain capital, and the general public uses this to invest in industry, leading to the rise of large-scale production enterprises under corporate organization, and thus the development of the national economy. The acceptance and discounting of negotiable instruments create a short-term capital market in the financial system, which can be analyzed as an acceptance market and a discount market. The former involves banks accepting collateral or guarantees provided by industrial and commercial enterprises and accepting the long-term drafts they issue, which are bank acceptances. These instruments are traded publicly in the market, with a publicly determined market price, forming the acceptance market. The latter involves industrial and commercial enterprises selling goods on credit and then issuing long-term drafts, which are accepted by the debtors who purchased the goods on credit, forming commercial acceptances. These instruments are financed by the financial industry through discounting, with the financial industry determining a public discount rate and discounting accordingly, forming the discount market. Through the use of the acceptance market and the discount market, industry and commerce can obtain short-term financing.</p>
<p>A financial system must have a long-term capital market and a short-term capital market to be considered sound. The long-term capital market must use stocks and corporate bonds as the main instruments, and the short-term capital market must use bank acceptances and commercial acceptances as the main instruments to be considered equipped with the necessary conditions for a modern financial market.

<h3>Guangxi Swimming Athletes - Participating in the National Games - Flag-Giving Ceremony Held in Nanning - Bai Chongxi Delivers Training Speech to Athletes</h3>
<p>(Nanning Correspondence) Guangxi Province has previously not sent athletes to participate in the National Games due to various reasons. The 6th National Games of the Double Tenth Festival will be held in Shanghai this year. The sports community of the province believes that track and field, ball games, and martial arts are not yet fully trained, and therefore cannot send representatives to attend immediately. Only swimming is well-trained, so it has been decided this year to send swimming athletes to participate. The Guangxi Swimming Athletes Group has been established and trained for several months. The best performers are Huang Jinghuan and Su Fangneng in the 100-meter and 50-meter freestyle, respectively. Huang Jinghuan and Lei Bing are also the best in the 400-meter and 2,500-meter freestyle. Liu Kun in the men's 300-meter breaststroke and Xu Zhenwan in the women's 200-meter are both outstanding individuals. In addition, men's and women's relay swimming also have hopes of competing in the National Games. The Guangxi authorities, in order to encourage the young athletes, held a flag-giving ceremony in Nanning on the 15th of this month, as the Guangxi swimming athletes are participating in the National Games for the first time this year. The venue was the Nanning Lequn Society. Military and political figures all attended the ceremony, including Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Li Pinxian, Wang Zanbin, Liang Hansong, Qiu Changwei, Lei Peihong, and hundreds of representatives from various agencies and organizations. The meeting was announced to begin at noon, chaired by Li Pinxian, who gave the opening speech, stating that the swimming athletes of the province are about to go to Shanghai to attend the National Games, marking the first time the province's sports banner will be displayed in the National Games. He hoped that the athletes would take it a step further, practice continuously, and strive to win the reputation of Guangxi youth sports in the National Games. Next, Bai Chongxi delivered a training speech to the athletes, stating that this is the first time Guangxi has sent athletes to participate in the National Games. The significance of sports lies in strengthening the physique and revitalizing the national spirit. In the past, the province implemented military training throughout the province, which was also intended to prepare for national salvation. Since China promoted sports, it has previously focused on trophyism, cultivating a small number of athletes, and ball games such as tennis belong to the aristocracy. Therefore, the province has decided on three principles for promoting sports: first, to be universal; second, to be economical and easy to implement; and third, to be practical. All 13 million people in the province should have the opportunity to participate in sports, and the focus should be on economical and practical items, so special attention is paid to swimming, mountain climbing, track and field, and shooting, with the aim of strengthening the physique to bear the responsibility of saving the country and the nation. This time, it is gratifying to win the National Games, but it is not shameful to lose. I hope that you will show the spirit of "hard work and endurance," "sincerity and bravery," and "hard work and hardship" of the Guangxi people at any time and in any place. All aspects of life should be disciplined and implement the province's sports aims. After the speech, the flag-giving ceremony was held. The athletes gathered on the commander's ship and nominated representative Lei Bingchang to step forward to pay respects to the chairman. The chairman returned the salute and presented a yellow flag to the athletes' representative. The ceremony was solemn, and the representative returned the salute as required before retreating. At this time, military music was played, and the ceremony was completed. The athletes then held an aquatic sports meet at the society's swimming pool, and also took the opportunity to select external athletes to avoid missing any talent, including Bai Bingjian and Li Dazhi in the men's 50-meter freestyle, Huang Zhicheng in the 1,500-meter, and Lei Xiufen, Lei Mujie, and Pang Baohua in the women's 50-meter freestyle.

<h3>This City's Guangdong Swimming Team Raises Questions About the Swimming Preliminary Selection</h3>
<p>——Requests Remediation from the Preliminary Selection Committee——</p>
<p>Wen Jingling and Xu Heng Were Not Selected</p>
<p>Requests Foreign Judges for Diving Preliminary Selection</p>
<p>This city's Guangdong Swimming Team has raised questions about the swimming preliminary selection for the National Games. It is reported that the team entrusted Peng Sanmei to manage everything for this city's National Games swimming preliminary selection, and the team has always been enthusiastic and supportive, deeply congratulating the swimming community of Shanghai on obtaining such a capable person. However, from the start of training to the end of the selection, the process has deviated from the principles of preliminary selection and caused dissatisfaction among the team members. In order to maintain the team members' sportsmanship, the team has sent letters to the Municipal Government and the Shanghai National Games Preliminary Selection Committee requesting remediation, and now lists the inappropriate points below:</p>
<p>According to the selection of the swimming team, it is divided into speed and diving. The selection method for the former is free registration, regular practice, and testing of each member's results as the selection standard, which is excellent and fair. However, team member Wen Jingling's exquisite swimming skills have always been famous. For example, when representing China at the Shanghai International Swimming Competition recently, he also performed excellently in front of the entire city's population. This time, his failure to be selected was unexpected. After investigation, the team feels regret that the results of some of the representatives selected are far inferior to Wen's. Some say that the reason Wen was not selected was because he could not attend practice every day. It is unknown that Wen is studying at Shanghai University, and it is difficult to travel back and forth every day. This had been notified to the host in advance, because studies should not be neglected, and the daily travel expenses are quite a lot (about three or four yuan), which is difficult for a student to bear. Also, he can still practice normally at the school. Therefore, for the sake of Shanghai's sports, and to encourage studious athletes, it seems necessary to remedy this regrettable event. Team member Xu Heng represented the city at the last National Games, and one of the most valuable points Shanghai obtained in swimming was due to this gentleman's strength, so as not to get a goose egg. His usual results show that the short-distance 50 meters is often under 30 seconds. When he participated in the three-style relay performance at the opening of the new city pool, his speed in the third leg certainly surpassed the others, and was better than the selected representative Zhang Rongguang. At that time, Zhang won the second leg of the frog-style, and after winning, he entered the water before Xu, but when he reached the finish line, he was equal to Xu. This is a fact that everyone saw, and there is no need to say more. As for those who blame Xu for not participating in training and should not be selected, it is even more incomprehensible. The preliminary selection had long stated that it would also look at usual performance as a standard for selection, and Xu has always been an excellent swimmer, but he was not able to participate in training because he had not returned from Java. Moreover, the representative selected last time had priority to attend. For example, Liang Peiyu of this year's women's tennis team was promoted to captain because she was sick and did not participate in the preliminary selection. This can be cited. Also, after the end of this preliminary selection, Peng repeatedly emphasized in the recent public competition of the Municipal Government that if the 500-meter racers achieved a result within 34 minutes, they could be rewarded with the opportunity to participate in the National Games as a representative. However, at the opening day of the city pool, he lightly let go of the well-known short-distance athletes like Xu Heng, and did not let them have a chance to try. This is really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>As for the diving group selection, it ended on the evening of the 16th at the West Youth Pool. This selection was not fully prepared in advance and was presided over by Peng alone. The results of the judging were especially regrettable.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the judges for this competition were not announced in advance. Peng temporarily invited Mr. Bright of West Youth to serve as the judge. The authorities handled this important matter so hastily. How can the certainty of the criticism be determined? It can be imagined.</p>
<p>As for the style of fancy diving, the judges' criticisms vary from person to person, and each has their own subjective views. For the same posture, some find a magnificent body beautiful, while others find a short and lean body aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, diving competitions in various countries around the world mostly have more than three judges to gather opinions from several parties for a fair judgment. Moreover, the position of the judges and the evaluation of the merits of the diver's posture are also greatly related. Only one judge was set up this time, how can the whole picture be seen? This has already lost the meaning of judging.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the representatives selected by China in recent years have all been filled by Chinese people as judges. However, Peng this time favored foreigners, and the intention is unknown. However, language barriers and conflicting meanings have already had a great impact on the athletes' results.</p>
<p>Sincerely, one hundred and fifty members of the Shanghai Guangdong Swimming Team.</p>

<h3>Liu Haisu's Opinions on Improving the Art School System</h3>
<p>Liu Haisu, the president of the Art Academy, believes that the current art school system in our country is not perfect. In particular, the fixed study period of three years is too short, and the admission qualification limited to high school graduates presents many difficulties. He has sent a letter to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education outlining his opinions on improvement. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, last month, I, Haisu, went to Beijing and discussed with the Minister the improvement of the art academy system in our country. I was deemed important and asked to draft a plan. Haisu, considering this a major matter, returned to Shanghai and conducted thorough discussions with various parties, and the principles have been tentatively determined. My humble opinions are presented as follows: (1) Improvement of the education system. Article 5 of the revised regulations for specialized schools states that art schools are classified as Type D specialized schools, with a study period of two years, similar to vocational schools for industry, agriculture, and commerce. The admission qualification requires graduation from senior high school, similar to the admission level of various departments of universities. In Europe, art schools and music schools, whose purpose is to train senior art experts and music experts, have no fixed admission qualifications, but require strict examinations, especially considering whether they have talent. Graduation also has a fixed time limit, and their research process is similar to that of universities, so they are often called research institutes or academies. According to Haisu's observation and experience, art schools and music schools in various countries are fundamentally different from other vocational schools. It is not reasonable to list them alongside other vocational specialized schools. A three-year study period is too short, and requiring a high school diploma for admission is inappropriate. The study of art and music mostly requires talent. Throughout history, many immortal writers, in terms of their level of general education, may not be equivalent to today's high school graduates, and there are not a few on the art history who failed because they were alienated from subjects that did not suit their temperament. The development of artistic temperament is the most important thing, and those with artistic talent often have a dislike for mechanical subjects. If they are forced to study them, it will not only not help their studies, but also harm the growth of their talent. If one cannot graduate from high school, there is no way to advance in school. Graduates also find that high school courses focus on subjects such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and artistic subjects are often omitted. In this way, after two years, the opportunity is gone, the age is long, and the hand is stiff and the eye is dull, and it is difficult to achieve anything. Although our country is currently in a transitional era and does not need to be perfect in everything, the distinction between advanced learning and general technology must be clarified. In the field of art schools and music schools, whether it is training teachers or experts, it cannot be equated with general vocational skills and classified as specialized schools. It should be renamed the Academy of Fine Arts or the Academy of Music. For the sake of meeting the urgent needs of society, such as the training of teachers of music, art, and handicrafts, it may be considered the same as vocational skills for the sake of quick success, but advanced learning must be treated as a separate matter and cannot be mixed. In Haisu's humble opinion, art schools and music schools should admit junior high school graduates, with a fixed study period of five years, the last three years for specialized subjects, and the first year for preparatory subjects. The departments for training teachers may be shortened slightly, which is already a compromise compared to European countries. Whether students study pure art, applied art, or teacher training, they must undergo strict basic training in the first two years of preparatory subjects. Students who do not meet the required level should be required to take compulsory remedial courses. Only when they reach perfection can they advance to the next level. If we believe that advanced learning cannot be borrowed, and if we want scholars to avoid superficial words, then the improvement of the education system is a matter that cannot be delayed. (2) Principles of improvement. A. Elevating pure art. Before the advent of modern technology, there were great artists and thinkers who, with a spirit of perseverance, engaged in ideological and artistic movements to inspire the national character of excellence and perseverance and to stir up a spirit of enterprise. Great artists are the soul of a nation, enduring for thousands of years. All countries devote their efforts to artistic construction and dare not lag behind. Great artists are especially admired. At this time of national rejuvenation in our country, artistic talents should be encouraged and supported in the hope of expressing the ideology of this great era and building our new Chinese national culture. Therefore, the pure art departments of art schools, such as students studying painting and sculpture, should have their level specially raised, and their academic year should be at least five years, or even not stipulated, and they can graduate only after their usual performance is approved by the school council. In ordinary times, special attention should be paid to the cultivation of their character and the training of their thoughts. The content of the course should be simple, appropriate, profound, and the preparatory subjects should be as complete as possible. B. Developing applied art. At present, China is an economically backward country with a trade deficit. The promotion of applied art is extremely urgent. The critic Ruskin often sought out the thoughts, feelings, and moral spirit of each era from architecture and applied art. The manifesto of the Constructivist faction even contains the phrase "Anything that cannot be practical cannot be called art." This shows that it occupies an extremely prominent position culturally and economically. According to the current needs of China, art schools should urgently establish a department of applied art to train production talents in applied art and use new European methods to improve and promote China's inherent handicrafts such as metal casting, ceramics, embroidery, and weaving, so as to meet the requirements of the times. This is also an important issue that should be decided first in the improvement of the education system.</p>

<h3>Central Party Headquarters Orders Local Party Headquarters to Dismiss Scout Instructors, Directly Managed by Local Councils</h3>
<p>The Boy Scouts in our country were originally managed and guided by personnel jointly dispatched by local party and government departments. Now, the Central Party Headquarters has formally established the Boy Scout General Association, and all Boy Scout affairs in various places are directly managed by the association. All Boy Scout instructors have been dismissed. The original text of the Central Command to local party headquarters is recorded below: (Omitted above) It has been found that the Boy Scout profession in our country has been largely guided and carried out by personnel dispatched by local party headquarters and education departments in the past. Now that the Boy Scout General Association of China has been formally established, all Boy Scout affairs in various places should be unified under the management of the association in order to unify authority. According to the association's request, all Boy Scout instructors in provinces and cities where Boy Scout councils or councils' preparatory offices have been formally established shall be dismissed, and their affairs shall be directly managed by the local councils or councils' preparatory offices, so as to assign responsibilities. The 186th standing committee meeting of the association has decided to approve the case. In addition to distribution, this order is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, Lectures at Tongji University</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, Cheng Tianfang, the first Chinese Ambassador to Germany, visited the National Tongji University in Wusong to attend the school's memorial week lecture. All Chinese and German faculty and students of the school attended, and the occasion was very grand. The school president, Weng Zhilong, first gave an introduction, stating that Ambassador Cheng is an advanced member of the party and the country, a leader of the cultural movement, and is now honored to be the first ambassador to Germany, and will certainly promote Sino-German relations and cultural cooperation. Ambassador Cheng then gave a lecture, first stating that he is willing to work hard to promote Sino-German relations and culture, and then said that China's crisis is that externally, it is oppressed by strong neighbors and is situated between two major powers, and the national situation is in danger. Internally, due to the import surplus of foreign trade, economic bankruptcy has been formed, coupled with natural disasters and man-made disasters, and it is sufficient to destroy the country without foreign aggression. The responsibility for saving the country lies in the general knowledge and youth who have received higher education, and they must work hard for the country. The past of merely shouting slogans and running around, and the recent depression and disappointment, are not the ways to save the country. We must cultivate strength and the determination to serve the country, and then express it with appropriate methods. Some people may think that the foreign insults suffered by China are all due to the weakness of the navy, army, and air force, but they do not know that the strength of a country's navy, army, and air force depends entirely on the degree of progress in industries, economy, education, and science. Therefore, the efforts of young people in libraries and research rooms are of the same value as soldiers fighting on the battlefield. The medical and engineering departments of Tongji University are the two departments most needed for the revival of the Chinese nation, because they will not only treat individual diseases, but their major task is to promote the health of the nation, extend the years of national service, and enhance the spirit and courage to take on responsibilities. Engineering can directly promote the development of domestic industry and science, indirectly assist the progress of the navy, army, and air force, and can eliminate natural disasters, relieve the people's difficulties, and revitalize transportation. It can not only facilitate the transportation of agricultural products and develop the national economy, but also make political exchanges more frequent and easier to unite. This is why industry is even more important. Finally, he also said that the revival of Germany is mostly due to the hard-working and patient spirit of the intellectual class and university professors, as an encouragement to the audience, who were all moved and changed their expressions.</p>

<h3>Boy Scout Troop Organized in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, Jin Xing and others, in view of the increasing population in West Shanghai and the lack of order in public gatherings, have gathered comrades to organize a Chinese Boy Scout Troop in order to provide services at any time. It has been designated by the Boy Scout General Association of China as the 1545th Chinese Boy Scout Troop. Since the recruitment of troop members began, all sectors have praised and supported the troop for its righteous purpose. In addition to providing their own uniforms, members do not have to pay any other fees, so participation is extremely enthusiastic. There are still vacancies available. Those interested can request the regulations from Zhenhuan Primary School at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Dagu Road in the city and register quickly.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Shanghai Japanese Correspondence School</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Japanese Correspondence School at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Aihuiyuxian Road has been actively expanding its enrollment with reduced fees, the number of students joining has been increasing daily. Recently, in order to enrich the content, Mr. Fu Dichun, who recently graduated from Kyoto Imperial University and returned to China, has been newly hired to grade papers. Mr. Fu has studied in Japan for many years and has a deep understanding of Japanese, especially in grammar, which he can analyze clearly, so that general students can be satisfied. In addition, five graduates boarded the Shanghai Maru to Japan on the 15th of this month and recently sent a letter reporting that they did not feel painful in terms of language when they first went abroad, which was indeed a gift from their alma mater. It is heard that the school is enrolling students all year round. Details will be sent upon request by mail.</p>
<h3>Little Boy (Five or Six)</h3>
<p>— Original by American Miss Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Poor old Huanghua has been in a bad mood these days because she recently lost her calf and is very sad. Therefore, she sees all human beings as her enemies (who can blame her)? So when that "Matador" (Note 1) leaped towards her, with a red handkerchief hanging from the tip of his spear and flying in the wind, she only raised her head and mooed! Taomi still rode towards her, but seeing it was his old friend, he was willing to get closer, but when the spear hit her back and made a bang, both the donkey and the cow were taken aback and felt disgusted. Taobi took a step back and neighed to express his sympathetic protest, and the old Huanghua cow, after this blow, lowered her horns and was filled with hatred.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Matador is a person who fights bulls in Spain. If the bull loses, he will slaughter the bull.</p>
<p>"Hit her again, don't let her go, Taomo; she's angry and will be here soon!" Tang En shouted, and he rushed up from behind with another stick, and Jieke and Neda did the same.</p>
<p>Old Huanghua saw that she was surrounded and treated impolitely, so she walked quickly around the field, feeling worse every moment. Later, she became mad, because no matter which direction she walked, there was always a terrible child shouting wildly and waving a strange and hateful whip. They thought it was very interesting! But it was really painful for her, until she couldn't bear it any longer, and suddenly changed the whole situation with a swift and violent move. She suddenly turned around and rushed straight to her old friend Taobi, because she really hated him for pushing her too hard. Poor Taobi, who was slow to move, quickly retreated backwards, but lost his balance when he was tripped by a stone. Poor man, horse, and everything fell into a chaotic mess. Old Huanghua, in a panic, jumped over the wall and ran wildly along the road.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Wang Yu)</p>
<p>When taking things to pawn, one hopes that the amount of money on the pawn ticket is large; when redeeming, one hopes that the amount of money on the pawn ticket is small.</p>
<p>Many people in Shanghai change their clothes for the four seasons in pawnshops.</p>
<p>A pawn ticket that has expired, I don't know how many tears it has been stained with.</p>
<p>Things pawned in the pawnshop are like a person committing a crime and going to jail; after eighteen months, it's like being in jail and still being shot in the end.</p>
<p>Pawnshops were originally for emergency relief, but often a person dies more quickly from being in urgent need because all his things have been pawned.</p>
<p>These days, pawnshops are "stopping pawning and waiting for redemption," ordinary people are "stopping redemption and only pawning," and the poor are "unable to pawn and unable to redeem."</p>
<p>Only the rich are qualified to open pawnshops, and the counters of pawnshops are all very high, which is to tell us that the poor are "too high to reach."</p>
<h3>Vitamin X</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Let's hold back on boasting about the progress of modern science and the brilliance of medicine. X-rays, radium, vitamins A, B, C, D, and everything else seem capable of bringing life back to any difficult or complex illness. But in reality, for all the prevalent mental illnesses today, what remedy is there other than watching patients choose to take "sleeping pills," "Lysol," "raw opium," and other such passive treatments?</p>
<p>The mental illnesses I'm talking about, listen, are not those that can be treated in mental asylums, nor are they illnesses that Chinese and foreign doctors can diagnose through observation, auscultation, questioning, and palpation. Naturally, they are even less curable by bottled, boxed, or packaged pills, powders, or liquids. The only symptom of this kind of mental illness is sighing and lamenting, with everything confined to extreme negativity and pessimism. The sources of the illness can be divided into two types: failure in love and failure in career or difficulties in life.</p>
<p>The only miraculous cure for this type of mental illness, to put it bluntly, is known to everyone except fools: shining silver dollars. But "shining silver dollars" is not a suitable name for a medicine, so it is named "Vitamin X." For example, for those who have failed in love, as long as they are given "Vitamin X," they won't have to worry about not conquering the other party. Those who have failed in their careers, after taking Vitamin X, will it not be the same as taking a stimulant? Do they still need to worry about not being able to rise up again?</p>
<p>However, although I have this great invention that benefits the masses, because the cost of this elixir is too high, I cannot start to formulate it. But at the same time, I dare not keep it secret, so I am publishing it specifically, perhaps there are many wealthy philanthropists in the world who will donate to help the world.</p>
<p>Please note that at present, in the areas of the Yellow River and Yangtze River floods, a large amount of Vitamin X is urgently needed!</p>
<h3>The Problem of Getting on the Bus</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>On Nanjing Road on Sundays, you can encounter Westerners and their wives everywhere. They are most polite to white women, and everywhere they are practicing the principle of "Ladies first," but it is not like this for Chinese women. It seems that Chinese people should not receive this kind of politeness from white people, which is really enough to make people feel disheartened.</p>
<p>However, Chinese men are now also striving to "respect" women and are practicing the principle of "Ladies first" everywhere. Although Chinese women cannot avoid the contempt of white men, they can still receive the "tenderness" of their own men. They can still be considered fortunate!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, while waiting for a public bus in the crowd near the New World, a small dispute arose between a Chinese "Westernized" couple and a "foreign" couple because they were scrambling to get on the bus. The Chinese man, wanting to show Western politeness, was about to "support" his woman onto the bus when he was suddenly stopped by an arm with a hand covered in yellow hair. At the same time, he heard the phrase "Ladies first" in a foreign accent. He was embarrassed to disobey the foreign man who was observing this principle! The foreign woman took advantage of this opportunity and got on the bus. The foreign man also wanted to get on the bus, but he was stopped by an arm with a hand covered in exposed blue veins. He also heard the phrase "Ladies first" in English. He seemed surprised that a Chinese person dared to mess with him, but he saw that to the left of the Chinese man stood his wife, who was eager to get on the bus. So he felt that the meaning of the word "Ladies" should not be divided by race! Helplessly, he retracted the foot he had placed on the bus!</p>
<p>I wish I could know that man's name now, because he was able to win back some face for our Chinese women!</p>
<h3>Uneven Distribution of Booty!</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<h3>The Piao Miao Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When eating, the imperial kitchen first presented her with a small silver hot pot; because chrysanthemums were always in season in the autumn, hot pot had quickly become a necessity at banquets. Although it seemed a bit early, it was not surprising. What was noteworthy was the relationship between the chrysanthemums and the hot pot. Originally, the hot pot was already filled with more than half a pot of original chicken broth or meat broth. The lid was made very tightly, so that the temperature would not easily dissipate, and even the fresh and fragrant smell would not escape. At this time, the chief eunuch in charge of meals, Zhang Dean, had already prepared a small dining table slightly larger than a tea table in front of the Empress Dowager's seat. There was a round hole in the center of this table, which could just stably support the hot pot in the middle; originally, this table was designed specifically for this purpose. Along with the hot pot, several shallow small plates were brought out from the imperial kitchen, filled with thinly sliced raw fish or raw chicken slices that had been skinned and boned; but because the Empress Dowager liked to eat fish, sometimes only fish slices were prepared, with a little sauce and vinegar.</p>
<p>The washed chrysanthemum petals were naturally also piled on this small table. Then Zhang Dean reached out and lifted the lid of the hot pot, but did not put it down, only holding it in his hand to wait. The Empress Dowager personally picked up a few slices of fish or meat and put them into the soup, and Zhang Dean quickly replaced the lid. At this time, the person eating—the Empress Dowager herself—and the people watching—our group—all solemnly and quietly waited, with dozens of gazes focused on the hot pot. (424)</p>
<h3>Suffering by Association</h3>
<p>— (Er Yu)</p>
<p>Chinese people, no matter what they do, have a tendency to not seek thorough understanding, which is perhaps why careers stagnate and do not advance. Taking reading as an example, today's students are most fond of showing off their cleverness, finishing a very thick book in just half a day. Whether they can have a deep and accurate understanding is something no one can control. I will give an extremely simple example: "suffering by association." Most people explain it as disaster befalling the fish in the pond. In fact, a "shen" character is missing between "chi" (pond) and "yu" (fish). "Chi Zhongyu" was a scholar of the Chu state whose house was burned down by a neighbor's fire, so the phrase "suffering by association" came about. Now many people use it in articles, but its origin has long been lost.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Senior Officials Cherish Their Reputation and Know How to Knock on Doors; New Love Departs From Flesh and Blood, With No Way to Visit the Sick</p>
<p>Still halfway up the stairs, not yet upstairs, he took out a handkerchief from his pocket, wiping his sweat as he nodded to Ze Cheng and smiled: "I finally completed the mission." County Magistrate Zhou is still waiting for me to discuss other matters, so I won't go upstairs. Please reply to Commissioner Lan. After saying this, he turned around and went downstairs. He walked back to his room, passing the entrance of Gan Zhiqian, and saw that he was still reading under the light, so he said to himself: "I knew Commissioner Lan would have to ask me for help! I'm not bragging." Although he was talking to himself, his voice was still not very low. This caused the servant to immediately come in and pour him water and make tea. Following this, Qiu Ze Cheng also came to visit, asking him about the outcome of the negotiations. Jie Fu boasted for a while, saying that everything had been smoothed over. However, there was one matter that he had asked Mr. Jia to introduce, but now Mr. Jia was a little unhappy and unwilling to write a letter of introduction again, so he had made a considerable sacrifice for Commissioner Lan. As he said this, he kept frowning and sighing. Ze Cheng sat in silence for a while. Seeing that his expression was somewhat unhappy, he pondered and said: "I don't know whether the commissioner can introduce talent as soon as he arrives here. But perhaps I can help in other places." Jie Fu immediately smiled and said: "I am not a big figure, so I won't talk about developing the Northwest. As long as I have food to eat, I can go to any place." Hearing this, Ze Cheng could not help but smile a little. Jie Fu immediately straightened his face and said: "Although I cannot avoid asking Commissioner Lan for help, I definitely do not have any intention of coercing him. Even if he doesn't come up with a solution for me, I will still be a mediator to the end. Didn't I say so? I remember that we are still from the same hometown." (324)</p>

<h3>The Spectacle of Japanese Cafés</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Drinking coffee was originally a habit of Europeans and Americans, but I don't know how it spread to Japan, creating the most mysterious den of vice. In the new Chinese novels with a Japanese flavor, authors always praise the cafés on Tokyo's Ginza Street as being as magnificent as the Guanghan Palace, with waitresses who are as beautiful and knowledgeable. This makes readers imagine what a good place Japanese cafés are. But the reality is very different; they are simply dens of money-wasting.</p>
<p>The development of the café business in Japan is astonishing. Wherever there are bustling streets, such as Ginza, Shinjuku, and Asakusa, they are everywhere. Even in very desolate places, they still have their businesses. There are at least tens of thousands of them in all of Tokyo. The storefronts on the main streets and roads are very expensive and too conspicuous, so they are all located in nearby quiet streets and alleys, with very small frontages, with beautiful and dazzling red lights. Every evening, as the lights come on, the waitresses dress up seductively, waiting for customers at the small entrances, peering and craning their necks.</p>
<p>Ordinary cafés are very small, and even if you arrange them economically, they can only seat a dozen or so people. Small electric lights of various colors emit dim light. The waitresses sit next to the customers, allowing them to tease them. A phonograph is an important tool, playing various intoxicating music, adding auditory stimulation to the senses of sight and taste. The waitresses can all sing, and their clear songs, harmonizing with the phonograph, can really be soul-stirring.</p>
<p>A cup of coffee is at most two jiao, and they can't survive on coffee revenue alone. Their sole purpose is to sell alcohol. A few bottles of beer and foreign wine can be very valuable. Moreover, the price is not fixed. It is very common for two people to spend twenty or thirty yuan on one visit. The waitresses' tips are even more unpredictable, depending entirely on the customers' generosity. But when they encounter stingy customers and the tips are too small, they will play a prank, scattering a handful of salt on you as you leave, indicating that they don't want such patrons to visit again.</p>
<p>Because of the development of cafés in Tokyo, girls from the countryside all run to Tokyo. Other professions are not easy to find. If they are of the right age and have pretty faces, they can go to cafés to work as waitresses. Because the café doors are plastered with advertisements for hiring waitresses all day long, they seem to accept anyone who comes. At the very least, they have graduated from elementary school, and some have graduated from girls' schools. Some people say that even female students above the specialized level enter cafés, but that is extremely rare. They are open for business from the afternoon until 12:00 at night, and they usually have two shifts, taking turns resting. They have to force themselves to smile all day long, accompanying guests drinking and smoking. Their stomachs are full of beer and coffee, cold and hot, which is not a good thing, so they almost don't need to eat, and their stomachs are never hungry.</p>
<p>In addition to their monthly salary, their income usually depends on the customers' tips. Fortunately, they all have their own regular customers, who come to patronize them from time to time, and they can also do side jobs. Otherwise, how can they maintain their frequently changed clothes and household food expenses? Japanese women originally marry very late, and the waitresses are all young girls, so it is very easy for them to fall in love with customers. There are several suicides every day due to heartbreak and marriage problems. Same-sex love is also most common among actresses and waitresses.</p>
<p>Large-scale cafés (sometimes called Western-style bars) have two or three floors, are luxuriously decorated, and can rival game halls and large companies. There are more than two hundred waitresses, each assigned a number, and they hand out small business cards with their nicknames. Customers can freely choose which number to call to accompany them. These types of cafés are relatively proper, and all kinds of food have fixed prices, but the prices are especially expensive. Small plates of snacks for drinking are sold on small carts. A piece of raw tofu and twenty or thirty pods of edamame cost four jiao, which would be enough to buy for forty or fifty wen in a small restaurant in our country. There are also regulations for waitresses' tips, one yuan per person, but additional small tips are, of course, all the better. There are already two or three such large cafés in [location], and they are fully booked every night, with several thousand yuan in daily turnover. Café King Li Qidong is a Korean who made his fortune by running cafés.</p>
<p>Japanese people often criticize Americans for pursuing dancing, drinking, extravagance, and waste. But the bad habits of drinking and drinking coffee in their own country are also very prevalent. This kind of den of vice has gradually been understood by the government and the public. Last year, students were forbidden from entering cafés. Recently, government offices have wanted to drive cafés and Western-style bars in Ginza and Marunouchi out of the country altogether, so this mysterious den of vice will be relocated to a better place.</p>

<h3>Sassoon Chinese Merchants Bailed Out Foreign Exchange - Silver Prices Rise, Banks Forced to Sell - The Result of the Struggle is Balanced and Open</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign telegrams, London's major terms were all long at 0.625, New York's silver market was stable, while the forward silver price in Montevideo shrank by 1 to 1.5 points. London's raw gold rose by 1 penny, British to American dollars were long at 3.125, British to French francs were stable, American to French francs rose by 3.75, American to British pounds were stable. The situation in Europe remained tense, and people were somewhat tired. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent-term selling prices. The British pound was offered at 1 shilling, 6 pence, 3.125 and 3.75. The American dollar was 37.5 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was down 0.03125 and the American dollar was up 0.0625. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both British and American dollars at par. The Customs Gold Unit rose by 4 points, but due to the lack of public confidence, banks continued to offer sales after the opening, leading to a relaxation of prices. It was expected that the HSBC exchange rate would be at par for both British and American dollars, and the market would hover around this level. Banks seized the opportunity to bail out at low prices, which allowed the market to be maintained. Sassoon suddenly bailed out in shillings, and the market only became firm after a preliminary review. Subsequently, Sassoon continued to bail out, and demand temporarily exceeded supply, leading to a very tight trend. Sin Fung &amp; Co. took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and banks also came to sell. Although Chinese merchants were bailing out, they were keen to unwind their positions quickly due to expectations of a significant rise in Indian silver. However, they were able to maintain their positions because Cantonese merchants strongly bailed out in American dollars. However, the banks' selling appetite remained strong, making it difficult to further tighten the market. The second telegram on Indian silver reported little movement and a mediocre final trend. At the close of trading, recent-term British pound was at 1 shilling, 6 pence, 3.225, and the American dollar was at 37.4375 yuan. Compared to the previous close, British and American dollars were at par. Chinese merchants bailed out approximately £130,000 in shillings and over $300,000 in American dollars. Sassoon received shillings. The daily transaction record will be listed below.</p>

<h3>Securities - The Last Surge of September Futures - Reduced Military Spending, Squeezing Longs, the Distant Higher Than the Near-Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was the last day for September futures. The market situation evolved into a squeeze on longs, especially with the most long position rollovers in reduced military spending. Because there was a lottery interest this month, the distant term had always been higher than the near term by 76 jiao. Yesterday, due to the squeeze on longs, the distant term was higher than the near term. This phenomenon was actually due to the tight money supply. The long side was unable to take delivery. This was an unprecedented phenomenon. Based on this speculation, the future looked rather bleak. Longs rushed to exit and short covering for the 16th was extremely active. The overall trend of the day was completely dominated by the panic of the longs. Although there were occasional short squeezes, they were very minor. Today, only October futures will be traded for one month, and the market situation may still not be stable. After yesterday's events, the opening seemed weak, and many longs were still watching, down slightly by 5 to 12 jiao. In the second session, longs in reduced military spending rushed to exit and do short covering, falling sharply by 6 jiao. After checking, the total amount of this public debt was only around 28 million, but it was so loose and abundant, which was quite surprising. In the afternoon, the two sessions were still dominated by short covering transactions, with ups and downs, but the short covering by longs was still relatively strong. Market prices also generally rose more than they fell. The squeeze on longs suddenly intensified again, and the decline was relatively large. Overall, the trend was difficult to be optimistic about. As a result, market prices uniformly trended downwards, down by 12 jiao to 35 jiao, with reduced military spending for this month alone down by 7.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was 11,161,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Awaits Opportunity</h3>
<p>Sin Fung &amp; Co. reported that yesterday (September 24th), the New York stock market's trading volume turned sluggish as operators awaited the development of the European situation, but the market was quite firm. Later, prices began to ease as Lundius was selected as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Railroad stocks were particularly weak. Small exchange stocks advanced under the leadership of special stocks. In and out were also weak. The price market was quiet and rose slightly. The daily turnover was 1,010,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left. The Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers - Sellers Deliver Large Quantities - Yarn for This Month Still Jumps Up 1.4 Yuan - Longs Try Hard to Take Delivery... Amounting to 7,000-8,000 Bales, Yarn Market Tends to Be Firm -</h3>
<p>Because the current month's term was the last day of business yesterday, although sellers had large quantities to deliver and sufficient chips were available, buyers, considering the recent brisk sales and the fact that many yarn factories have not yet resumed production, resulting in reduced inventory, decided to take delivery. Moreover, the selling price of both branded and current yarns was at par, so the market situation was still peaceful. The last session for delivery was at 174.4 yuan, which was 8.8 yuan higher than the end-of-August price of 165.6 yuan. The delivery volume was huge, around 7,000-8,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster and Ju Chang Rush to Exit in Each Session -</h3>
<p>Before the opening of the branded yarn market, most discussions anticipated a decline because there were as many as 9,000 bales for delivery. However, the opening price was still flat. New sellers in the market were not aggressive. When bidding for forward terms, the supply was found to be drying up, and the market sentiment was particularly tight. After the session, the rising trend started, and the situation became even tighter. The market for this month rose 1.4 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, with distant terms rising 0.9 to 1 yuan. The closing price was 174.4 yuan, which was 8.8 yuan higher than the August term price. The distant month was down 1.3 yuan compared to the morning close.

<h3>Although New Cotton Arrivals are Abundant, the Standard Remains Firm -</h3>
<p>Cotton prices are rising, and the market situation is very high. Although the U.S. cotton situation feels softened, new cotton shipments are abundant, and the source is plentiful. Yao cotton arrived yesterday at more than 12,600 bales. The abundance of arrivals is the first time this year. There is also news of abundant arrivals of Tong cotton. The local market has not been affected. This is due to the activity of shorts covering and large long positions absorbing and not releasing the cotton.</p>
<h3>Branded Cotton Slowly Rises in Response to Short Covering -</h3>
<p>Before the opening of the branded cotton market in the early morning, the crowd discussed a decline of 2 jiao because 13,000 bales of Yao cotton and more than 3,000 bales of Tong cotton had arrived in Shanghai, and people's confidence was low. However, the near month was stable at the opening, and the distant month suddenly appeared tight. In fact, the chips in the market were depleted, and the trading floor was dry. After the second session, the market price rose slowly, and short covering activity increased. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 jiao to 2.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market trend remained firm when the market opened in the afternoon, but trading was not active. Until the close, it relaxed slightly. As a result, the near month rose by 0.05 to 1.5 jiao compared to the morning close, and the distant month was flat. Checking, Tung Hing sold 1,800 dan, Shing Shing 1,400 dan, Da Fung 900 dan, Yu Hong 800 dan, Yuen Da 1,600 dan, Cheung Yu 800 dan, Yan Fung 1,300 dan, Tai Cheung 1,100 dan, Yick Chang 1,200 dan, Sing Yuen 1,200 dan, Tung Wo 1,800 dan.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Hedges Appear Less on Monday -</h3>

A small amount of hedging was overturned by purchases from foreign firms and returning traders. The weather was very good. The small increase in the amount of ginned cotton proved the delay in harvesting. Afterwards, factories bought near-term contracts at limited prices. Spot demand was brisk. The market price was stable. The market sentiment seemed to be waiting for the development in Europe. The Cotton Exchange estimated that world consumption of U.S. cotton in August was 911,000 bales, compared to 957,000 bales in the same period last year. Prices were average.

<h3>Grains - Flour and Wheat Markets Generate Rumors Again - Buying Sentiment Booms in the Later Market... Tired and Recovering -</h3>
<p>The flour market initially fell, then showed signs of a sharp rise. Because of the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell 2-3 jiao, and Canada fell 1 jiao and some points. Market sentiment, with the issue of foreign wheat being continuously processed for two days, temporarily showed a stagnant situation. Therefore, the thinking of both traders and outsiders inevitably changed. Near and distant terms all fell by 3 points or less. But after the first session, the market sentiment revived again. Because large traders absorbed one after another, factories held on and did not release. So each month rebounded by 2-3 points. When the market opened in the afternoon, rumors of currency issues spread again, leading to excited buying sentiment. Near and distant terms rose rapidly again. Compared to the morning close, it was better by 2 points, and compared to the opening price, it reached between 5-6 points. The total turnover for the day was one million bags, which shows that the situation is still serious.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened in the morning. Because of the quoted price of foreign wheat, both the US and Canada continued to fall by 23 jiao or less. This caused fatigue in people's minds. The calling prices for each month all fell by 34 points uniformly. Afterwards, the near-term wheat prices leveled off, while the distant terms fell back by 12 points. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for the current month was relatively stable because delivery was approaching. Because of the sharp rebound in distant term closing, there were rumors in the market. Therefore, buying sentiment was booming, and transactions were smooth. Compared to the morning opening, it rebounded by as much as 8 points. Observing the later stages, it is feared that the bottom code is not even, and it is easy to rise and difficult to fall.

<h3>Street Sales of Rice Slightly Move -</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, each origin was 35-36 (there were more than 7,000 shi of goods in total). The street sales moved more, and the situation was tight. However, the absorption of parcels suddenly stopped later, and only one load of Te Po and one load of Bai Ge were purchased, and the market color was slightly affected. As a result, it was fixed and stable. Except for the fact that Zhong Guan cargo showed a slightly showy color, the other items were all unremarkable. Each new Keng Ha cargo rose by one jiao because the goods were scarce. The supply and demand of new sharp round granules from the factory are commensurate, and the long sharp is fragrant. The price for Biao Ge straw bales of special goods opened at 9.4 yuan, and the special fragrant straw was 10.09 yuan to 10.07 yuan. The white yuan of both old and new goods were all average.</p>
<p>(North) Yesterday, the origins of each cargo from He Xia were 44-45. Each cargo on the market was in demand. Because the weather turned cloudy, the shops’ appetite was quite good. Bai Po Keng increased and the price was fixed. Medium and sub-quality goods were added to the price. Dong Shin Keng was firm. There were still few arrivals of West Shin Keng. In addition, the activity of change was lively, and there was an increase in prices. Although new Yang Jian continued to arrive, the demand was also good. Because the price in the producing area was high, the customer side tightly controlled the price by 2 jiao. Besides the increase in the price of new Tuan Jian and Jiao Bai Jian, Bai Si was fixed. Bu Jian was tightly controlled, and customer Jian turned firm. The rest of the cargoes also saw a firm trend. The North Gang stopped running.</p>
<h3>The North Gang Stopped Running - Foreign Keng Saw a Strong Rebound -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign Keng Xian was even softer than the weary trend of the past few days. Moreover, the North Ocean Gang had stopped running. Therefore, the prices of each rice uniformly trended down, down 15 points to nearly 1 jiao. Especially for the local gang, Siam rice was sold out by households, and the decline was even sharper. Previously, Siam Haoji rice had opened to 12.35 yuan, followed by 11.15 yuan, but yesterday the transaction volume reached 706 bales, and the official price fell to 11.7 yuan, which was 6.5 jiao lower than the high price of the previous week. The previous surge had been too high. Once the Tianjin Gang watched, there was a huge reaction. The other rice types rose more slowly. Therefore, the decline was also small. Throughout the day, 1,720 bales of Ningbo, Taizhou, and Nanjing rice were opened, with Nanjing Ji Cao rice accounting for the majority. There were 2,766 bales of Saigon Xiao Jiao Siam rice, which was handled by the street.</p>
<h3>New Zhizhi Yellow Beans Both Soar -</h3>
<p>Recently, after ocean firms continued to order 500 tons of new Zhizhi beans from the Sassoon market (the delivery price for November and December was 8.1 yuan), the market sentiment showed prosperity, and each bang's current sales were also quite lively. The market price stepped up. Yesterday, 480 or so bales of Nanjing Ma, 140 or so bales of Liuhe Ma, and 80 bales of Yangzhou Ma were opened. Because the source of new yellow beans was not surging, the demand for both new and old beans was not sufficient. The market situation was tight. Yesterday, the market price of each bean continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The demand from the street was brisk, and the inland demand only accounted for a quarter. Statistics show that 640 bales of new Tianjin Zhizhi beans, 480 bales of Jiu Jiang Zhi beans, one car of new Zhizhi beans from Siping Street, and 30 bales of new Jiangbei Zhizhi beans were sold.</p>

Da Yu vegetables also called for 20 yuan, but for a while, the traders were not willing to buy in too much. If the price is raised too high, it may not be easy to sell.</p>

<h3>Tou - Domestically Produced Horse Palm Satin Sells Well In Time -</h3>
<p>The horse palm satin, which is dedicated to thick and thin coats, has recently been launched in time. The clothing stores in the Da Xin Street area sell it earlier. Because its horse woolen, herringbone woolen, and clip coats have a better reputation than other places, imported horse satin sleeves are made. Domestically produced satin palm sleeve satin, because domestic goods are cheap and widely sold, imports have decreased by two-thirds. The goods sold in the market this year are all domestic goods.

<h3>September Season</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>If this is purely theoretical, then it naturally doesn't deserve the amusement of knowledgeable people. If it possesses some historical lessons, then it shouldn't be dismissed as mere scholarly talk. I detest those who exploit the dead, using innocent deceased people as a shield for their crimes. However, some crystallizations of ancient philosophers' thoughts can serve as guidelines for modern people, and certain fragments of past history can be used as lessons for modern people under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>From the perspective of human evolution, large-scale wars between human groups have a long history. In this long historical process, some theoretical tactics gained through experience have been considerably developed and passed down to modern people by any nation with a reasonably long history. Although these experiences have completely changed due to the vicissitudes of the times and the advancement of science, the basic conditions of war have not changed much. Opening the classic "Sun Tzu," which Chinese military strategists have always revered, it tells us, "If victory comes too slowly, weapons are blunted; if the army is exposed too long, the state's resources will be insufficient. When weapons are blunted, morale is dampened, strength is exhausted, and resources are depleted, the other lords will take advantage of the situation and rise up. Even a wise man will not be able to recover from this. "It also says, "Obtain resources from the state, and take supplies from the enemy… A wise general strives to eat from the enemy." It also says, "An army perishes without baggage, perishes without provisions, perishes without accumulated supplies." I believe these principles are still relevant to modern warfare because economic conditions have always occupied a very important position in wars, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, and are especially important in modern warfare. The military needs of a modern total war are definitely not comparable to the small-scale wars of ancient times, with "a thousand chariots and ten thousand armored soldiers." The "internal and external expenses, the cost of guests, the materials used for glue and lacquer, and the provisions for chariots and armor" of a modern country definitely do not stop at "a thousand gold coins per day" like in ancient times. Therefore, a country without a solid economic foundation and without abundant financial resources cannot wage a long-term war without eventually becoming impoverished and failing. This is a lesson for aggressor nations, and it can also be taken as a source of increased confidence in resistance for nations that are being invaded.</p>
<p>In fact, when a strong and overwhelmingly powerful aggressor invades a nation's territory, "serving them with cattle and sheep," "serving them with hides and coins," and "serving them with pearls and jade" will not be enough to prevent them from taking the entire land. The invaded nation has no choice but to "stake everything they own in one glorious throw." This is not just an emotional reaction, but it has a very important meaning. It means that if an invaded country has the determination to "break the cauldrons and sink the boats" and resist to the point of "mutual destruction" with the enemy, then when it reaches a point of no return, there is no need for the enemy to destroy important cities with airplanes and cannons first. Instead, they should first destroy the sources of wealth that the enemy could use, concentrate on strategic locations, and wage a protracted war, so that "there is nothing to plunder in the fields," and the enemy cannot use their resources to feed themselves. Although the modern nation's military supply preparation is not limited to "single food," and modern transportation is extremely convenient, unlike ancient times when "supplying rations from a thousand miles away caused soldiers to look hungry, and foraging for firewood and cooking after the fact meant the army couldn't eat its fill," but in a country with a vast territory and such inconvenient transportation, and in a prolonged war lasting several years, I don't believe that the enemy's baggage train can keep up with the food supply, or that their accumulated supplies can last without leading to their demise.</p>
<p>Let's use historical examples as proof. In 218 BC, the Carthaginian general Hannibal invaded Rome, and with his talent, he disturbed the Italian territory for fifteen years, and was invincible. In the territory of Etruria, near Lake Trasimene, he wiped out the entire Roman army in that area. In 216 BC, he defeated the army of the Roman general Varro in the Battle of Cannae, killing 50,000 men and capturing 10,000. Although Hannibal failed to conquer Rome due to a lack of siege weapons, the fall of Rome was imminent. However, Hannibal eventually found himself isolated and deep inside enemy territory, with his rear cut off by the Roman general Scipio Africanus. In addition, the Roman general Fabius implemented his "Fabian strategy," avoiding direct confrontation with Hannibal's army, but guarding strategic locations, cutting off Hannibal's supply ships, and attacking Hannibal's scattered troops. Under this kind of protracted war, Hannibal eventually had to withdraw from Italy because Scipio Africanus led his troops to conquer Africa. If history can really be used as a lesson, this is the first historical event with the most instructional significance.</p>
<p>Turning to modern history, we can also find a historical event with extremely instructional significance. That is the history of Napoleon's invasion of Russia and his defeat. We know that Napoleon's defeat after invading Russia from Poland was entirely due to geographical reasons, and not because of poor tactics, because Napoleon had not suffered any defeats before reaching Moscow. Napoleon always thought that after conquering Moscow, Alexander I would sue for peace, but the Russian government would rather burn Moscow than sue for peace, which Napoleon had not anticipated. Not only the government was like this, but also the people were resolutely opposed. When we talk about a section in Tolstoy's "War and Peace," we can know what kind of meaningful passive resistance the Russian people were making at that time.</p>
<p>"Every Russian, not from the deduction of reason, but from the emotions buried deep in our hearts and in the hearts of our ancestors, could know what would happen.</p>
<p>"From Smolensk upwards, in every town and village within Russian territory… the same events were happening, just like in Moscow. The people waited for the enemy's arrival without panic; they showed no excitement; nor did they tear anyone to shreds, but simply waited quietly for their misfortune to come, feeling within themselves a kind of power that would find the methods they ought to find in times of danger.</p>
<p>"And when the enemy was about to come, the richer people fled, leaving their property behind; the poorer people stayed behind and burned everything that was left." (According to Garnett's English translation of "War and Peace")</p>
<p>From this passage, we can see the national spirit of the Slavic people. On the one hand, they burned their property to show their unwillingness to submit. On the other hand, they waited for an opportunity to alleviate their difficulties. When winter arrived, all of Russia was buried in heavy snow, and Napoleon's army finally couldn't bear the hunger, cold, and retreated. These troops turned into hordes of marauders, looting for a living along the way. So, "the Russian peasants, as long as they had weapons, rose up to attack and kill the remnants of his 'Grand Army'." As H.G. Wells said, the retreat of Napoleon's Grand Army was "one of the greatest tragedies" in history.</p>
<p>The British author Joseph Conrad, through the words of an old Russian soldier, vividly described the miserable state of Napoleon's army in retreat:</p>
<p>"That was the first time my comrades and I had a close look at Napoleon's army. It was a strange and terrible sight. …A crowd of crawling, stumbling, hungry, half-mad people. This line emerged from the forest half a mile away, their heads disappearing into the darkness of the field... They offered no resistance. I only heard a few gunshots, perhaps only half a dozen. Their senses seemed to have frozen inside...</p>
<p>"My horse knocked a soldier to the ground. The poor wretch was wearing a blue cavalry uniform, completely torn and scorched, hanging from his shoulders in shreds, and he didn't even reach out to grab my saddle to save his own life. He just fell forward... (J. Conrad: A Warrior's Soul)." Napoleon, the invincible, would never have imagined when he first sent out his troops that the "savage Russians" (Des Russes Sauvages), despised by the French, would give him such a big defeat. If history can really be used as a lesson, this is the second historical event with the most instructional significance.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to talk about historical events that happened not long ago. In some places, these historical events can give people the courage to deal with foreign enemies. During the Russian Civil War, the peasants and those Shock Brigades were of great help in quelling Kolchak, Denikin, and foreign enemies. Their heroic battles were due, on the one hand, to the rape and pillage by the foreign invaders. As soon as the enemy invaded and occupied a school, they would immediately shout "Women! Russian girls, Russian girls!" This naturally aroused the great anger of the Russian people. On the other hand, the main reason was a firm belief. They fully understood the meaning of the war, so even though they knew they would fail, they did not retreat. Levinson, the protagonist in "The Rout" anticipated at the beginning of the war that "we are going to be defeated... certainly." Finally, Levinson broke through the encirclement, although he suddenly felt "...somehow, his whole body suddenly lost strength and withered away. People suddenly felt that he was very weak and very old." However, in the end, he regained his original perseverance. "He looked at the high, distant sky with silent, still moist eyes, this land that gives bread and peace, these distant people in the threshing yard—he should quickly make them all of one mind with himself... so he did not cry: he must live and fulfill his duty. (The above is from Zhou's translation of The Rout)." This epic describing the Russian Civil War truly expresses the main characteristics in the hearts of the Russian people at that time. Therefore, the defeat of Denikin and Kolchak was not accidental. If history can really be used as a lesson for us, this is the third historical event with the most instructional significance.</p>
<p>Finally, I will end with the words of the poet Schiller:</p>
<p>"The most despicable nation is the one that cannot stake all its glory in one throw." (See Guan's translation of The Maid of Orleans.) If you think this is a poet's emotion, this kind of emotion contains a very high meaning. Those people who are full of despondency, who have no ideals, who are rolling around in vulgar utilitarianism, and who are haggling over the weight of a goose feather, naturally will not understand this meaning and will think it is nonsense, so I naturally won't bother to argue with them.</p>
<h3>Suicide (2)</h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>"I don't remember," Dr. Lan frowned. At this moment, he remembered something, so he waved his hand and exclaimed in annoyance, "Three o'clock!" Then he slowly and impatiently paced back and forth.</p>
<p>The pastor became angry, wiping his face with a handkerchief forcefully. His voice was like thunder, and even the light overhead flickered in surprise:</p>
<p>"How can you forget so easily?"</p>
<p>"Do you know how many suicides have passed through my hands? And their backgrounds are always the same. You only come to see them occasionally, only see one occasionally, so naturally you remember them easily!"</p>
<p>The pastor seemed not to have heard what he said. He was still wiping his nose and thundering, "Can you still forget? When he was taken down from the ambulance, you said it was useless and told the nurse to call and send him to the morgue. Later, the nurse gave him artificial respiration, and when you looked closely again, you said he could still be saved, gave him an injection, and he slowly woke up. That's the one, that's the one!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it seems like there was one. Can he leave today?" Dr. Lan seemed impatient, as if he had mistaken someone, and slowly began to walk.</p>
<p>The pastor became even more excited and energetic, almost rubbing his nose raw. He fumbled in his bag. At this time, he remembered that he hadn't sat down since coming down from the elevator. So he wiped the white bench with his hand, sat down, and put the bag on his lap to rummage through it.</p>
<p>He took out a notebook and flipped to a page in the middle that recorded the patient's growth. He put down the bag and stood up again:</p>
<p>"Look, look, this is his name!"</p>
<h3>Yearning</h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>—On the Batur and Guyuan Wilderness—</p>
<p>We are hungry, we are hungry!</p>
<p>Let’s go, go quickly, do not fear the cold, do not fear the wind and snow, climb over Songji Mountain, cross the Ergun River—</p>
<p>Leap into the vast Siberian territory. That is a good place,</p>
<p>There is work there, making us so happy.</p>
<p>—The song of the Blagoveshchensk youth is spring.</p>
<p>Spring, on the Batur and Guyuan wilderness, coldness, desolation, and barrenness are still seen everywhere. Snowflakes, clean and radiant with white light, dance and cover the mountains, forests, villages, and still rivers.</p>
<p>The earth is deathly silent. The Batur and Guyuan wilderness is a boundless, desolate desert.</p>
<p>I feel no sorrow. Although I am a fugitive on this snowy Batur and Guyuan wilderness, although my heart has been pierced by countless, tattered, blood-stained holes by the sharp arrows of this wandering and impoverished life, I feel no grief or sadness. Instead, I joyfully stride forward with steps as firm as steel, heading straight towards the place of light on my unfinished path.</p>
<p>I need not worry with nostalgic feelings about the days to come. I know deeply, deeply, that the days to come will be filled with the light of the resurrected sun of death.</p>
<p>Nor do I need to feel lost with nostalgic feelings for the distant homeland that has sunk under the iron heels of oppression. I know even more deeply, deeply, that one day, the compatriots of my homeland will cry out like the eruption of a volcano.</p>
<p>(The sun tore through the thick, heavy clouds in the sky and smiled from afar.)</p>
<p>If life is enough to transform my thoughts, then I am willing to wander forever on this cold and desolate Batur and Guyuan wilderness. Enjoying the active breath of life that fills this wilderness. Wind, snow, hunger, and poverty have conquered me and transformed me into a cold, primitive person. I went deep into the Iktu-ru mountain villages, and I trekked through the valleys of the Ilan Hadayama. Only in the end did I wander to this Batur and Guyuan wilderness.</p>
<p>I spent a warm winter dream here. Now, according to the season, spring has come, but the wilderness is still howling with the angry winds of December. The grasslands, forests, rivers, and streams are as rigid as if they are asleep, and have not yet shown a hint of spring.</p>
<p>Spring, sprout quickly, I need your warm sunshine.</p>
<p>Perhaps Siberia is also covered in hard ice? Perhaps white snowflakes are falling? I finally think so. Thus, I longed for the beautiful dream of Siberia, and my restless and strange fantasies began again. Am I not also being forced by hunger? Whenever I recall the song of the Blagoveshchensk youth and savor it carefully, I am so happy and my heart is filled with encouraging courage, wanting to fly over Songji Mountain, cross the Ergun River, and leap into the vast Siberian territory.</p>
<p>However, I was disappointed—my heart couldn't help but turn cold, like a stagnant pool of forever still, quiet water.</p>
<p>Gazing at the continuous, undulating peaks like a long snake in the Bayanzurkh area east of the Ergun River, I was grieved. Alas, let me, this lonely wanderer, wander aimlessly on this desolate and melancholic Batur and Guyuan wilderness!</p>
<h3>Morning in the Suburbs (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>The sky was still dark, and already there were shadowy figures on the cinder paths of the suburbs. Although one could only see some blurry outlines of the people in front of them, everyone could greet each other with skillful familiarity:</p>
<p>"Morning."</p>
<p>"Oh, morning."</p>
<p>"Business is tough this year."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh, tough."</p>
<p>As usual, everyone nodded, smiled, sighed, exchanged a few brief words, and then ignored each other, going their separate ways.</p>
<p>The shadowy figures slowly dispersed, moving in all directions, sometimes expanding, sometimes shrinking, disappearing. In the fields, in the cotton fields, in the sorghum thickets, in the vegetable gardens, and near the manure pits, these grayish-white dots of activity were scattered everywhere. Everywhere was full of tireless farmers!</p>
<p>Humph yo! Humph yo! Necks stretched straight, teeth clenched tightly, were the small vegetable vendors running on the road. They had gotten up in the middle of the night, carrying their large and heavy loads, and had already run quite a bit of the way.</p>
<p>The rumbling, clattering carts also appeared. They carried fresh flowers for the idle classes in the city to enjoy.</p>
<p>Over there on the cinder road, the carts were being pushed with a "sha-sha-sha" sound, full of wet clothes. The sun had not yet come out, but here, snow-white, crimson, bright yellow-orange, and odd-colored clothes had already been hung up one by one on the large, rough rope racks supported by four bamboo poles. The clothes fluttered proudly on the racks, while the laundry workers below panted heavily.</p>
<p>The milk cart rattled along. The bottles full of milk, squeezed from the cows in the middle of the night, were stacked on the carts and were about to be delivered to the fortunate people to enjoy. The cows were milked until they were limp under the wooden frame of the milk shed, and the milkers were still wearing their white hats and coats!</p>
<p>In a corner under a shed, an old man was gargling, stripped to the waist. He scrubbed back and forth frantically inside his mouth with a yellowed toothbrush, muttering curses.</p>
<p>"Gen fa ge niang, huh, zao la ge niang, clothes are better for young people to wear! Zao la ge niang, such an old age, huh..."</p>
<p>While cursing, he spat a mouthful of dirty water onto the ground. Then he stuck a forefinger into his mouth and scratched over the incomplete row of teeth. Then, with thumb and forefinger pinching his nose, he let out a "whoosh," opened his hand, and a glob of bright green snot landed smack on the opposite peeling wall.</p>
<p>"Zao la ge niang! Such an old age..."</p>
<p>The old man grumbled, hunched over, and added another sentence.</p>
<p>In the empty space to the left of the shed, a small man as thin as a monkey, wearing a faded red bib, held a large bowl of rice porridge, walking and crying. Two streams of snot dripped down.</p>
<p>The old woman hid in a corner and didn't make a sound. She shielded her forehead with her hand, squinted her red eyes, and peeked ahead. Her withered mouth twitched a few times, then she quickly turned her head and spat coldly, before busily resuming her cooking.</p>
<p>The young daughter-in-law had just rushed out the door, the sleep still in the corners of her eyes, one hand clutching a large wooden basin and the other holding a large bundle of dirty clothes. She walked with a pout.</p>
<p>Di...da-da...di...da-da-di...da...</p>
<p>Very early, the bugle was blowing again at the barracks stationed nearby.</p>
<h3>Impressions on the Road</h3>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Sir Otto Niemeyer's Visit to China</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer of England, who has the mission of investigating the Chinese economy, arrived in China on the 21st, detouring from Japan. Our officialdom should be giving this visiting guest a very warm welcome. We must also say a few words here to express our humble welcome.</p>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer's mission in China is to investigate our country's currency system. Why does Sir Otto Niemeyer want to come to China to investigate the currency system? This is because China's currency system is too chaotic, and there is no fixed exchange rate with foreign countries. It must follow the pound or the dollar at any time. Especially since the United States raised the price of silver, China's currency system has been in a state of chaos. Therefore, Britain is very concerned and sent Sir Otto Niemeyer to China to see what the situation is. The purpose is to get the Chinese silver dollar to follow the pound, and not to be indecisive and subject to the control of other countries at any time. This is Sir Otto Niemeyer's true intention in coming to China. In other words, Britain wants to control China in terms of currency, so that China will become its dependency in terms of currency. This is very clear, the current currency wars of various countries are an important strategy in the struggle for imperialism. China is likely to become a vassal of the US dollar at any time, so Britain naturally cannot help but want to change China's currency system.</p>
<p>This can be said to be an important mission of Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to China today. From behind Sir Otto Niemeyer, we can clearly see the complex background of the various countries fighting each other for China. Whether Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to China is really helpful to China is still a question, but the fact that China is now a piece of meat on the chopping board has already become a reality. This is one aspect.</p>
<p>Secondly, Sir Otto Niemeyer originally planned to come to the United States first, but then he suddenly changed his route, and came to China from Japan, China's eastern neighbor, instead of the United States. From this we can see how Britain is trying to increase the friendly relationship between Britain and Japan. The rapprochement between Britain and Japan indicates that the two countries may have a growing consensus on China. This clearly shows that the recent tensions in the European political situation have led Britain to rely on the strong countries in the Far East in mutually beneficial conditions, so naturally, China is again the first to bear the brunt.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, the general public is welcoming Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to China with twelve points of awe, while laughing bitterly. How much benefit will this trip of Sir Otto Niemeyer's bring to China, which can no longer be squeezed any further? We have no way of knowing. We can only hope that the nations can be forgiving and not keep drawing swords on us. This point is already an unexpected joy that cannot be hoped for.</p>
<h3>Road</h3>
<p>— Family</p>
<p>Starting several months ago, on the official road outside the West Gate of the county town, every day, one could often see a group of people, one with a badge on his chest, wearing thick-rimmed glasses, followed by two or three assistants. Some carried a "Luopan" compass, and some carried bamboo poles with red flags, patrolling back and forth on the official road. From this side to that side, first the person wearing glasses and a Zhongshan suit opened the "Luopan" compass, took out a pen, and compared and drew here and there on the paper. Afterwards, the assistants would stick the flag on the ground and then go back. They would come again the next day, always those few people, always that same routine. The people living nearby saw this every day, and they really felt a bit strange, but no one knew what it was all about. It seemed someone said they were surveying the foundation, and the official road was soon to be widened for cars.</p>
<p>But why did it have to be so cumbersome, taking months to get done? They really couldn't figure it out. However, when the topic of building a road was mentioned, they were very insightful and cleverly associated it with some troublesome matters. Especially many small shops facing the road. Everyone knew that their houses would be</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>torn down. Once torn down, they would have to be rebuilt, but what would they use to rebuild? That was something to worry about.</p>
<p>"You know, there will also be road construction fees and…"</p>
<p>When talking about it, some would explain it like this. If it came from the mouths of people from small shops facing the street, their faces would surely be wearing a worried expression.</p>
<p>"The county government's notice has already been posted!"</p>
<p>That evening, Chen Laoqi, the owner of the tea shop on the long street, came back from the city and told his neighbors a piece of worrying news.</p>
<p>"What does the notice say?" Someone asked urgently.</p>
<p>Chen Laoqi stood in front of his shop, illuminated by the dim light, and recited in a heavy tone: "The notice tells us shopkeepers to dismantle our shops voluntarily within a limited time. If we don't dismantle them after the deadline, people will be sent to enforce it forcefully." Those listening looked at each other with expressionless eyes. No one answered, and after a while, they silently dispersed.</p>
<p>As for Chen Laoqi, he didn't get a wink of sleep that night, because his shop had just been newly built a few months ago, and now it had to be destroyed and rebuilt. The year was bad, so what should he do…?</p>
<p>Three days later, the entire road was turned upside down by countless road construction workers. Piles of soil looked like small hills. Some were carrying baskets, some were crushing stones to prepare for paving the road, and some were digging ditches.</p>
<p>The shops on both sides were also being demolished one after another. On the long street, everything was messy and noisy, and it was almost impossible to imagine that the road could be blocked.</p>
<p>Those who delayed dismantling also finally had to dismantle.</p>
<p>In between all of this, there were as many as two or three months, or even half a year. Every shop was stuck in a state of half doing business and half being suspended. Expenses, however, could not be reduced by half a penny. On the one hand, they still had to pay various fees and levies, and on the other hand, they had to raise money to build new houses. In short, it was like getting through a difficult time.</p>
<p>Half a year later, the road was finished, but it was just filled with mud and sand in a slipshod manner. Whenever it rained, there were puddles everywhere, muddy and unbearable. When cars drove past, they always splashed a burst of sewage in all directions. The amount of various donations and fees that many shops paid seemed not small, but the result was just this kind of road. Everyone was naturally upset in their hearts.</p>
<p>As for the shops on both sides, those that were torn down were already torn down, but not many were rebuilt. As a result, the street became a weird, crooked, and dilapidated mess. Moreover, many shops simply closed their doors. Some time ago, this official road was originally very lively, but now it was very deserted. Walking there evoked a different kind of feeling.</p>
<p>The completion ceremony of the highway was held, and then traffic began to flow. People traveling long distances had cars to travel in, and when they were in a hurry to get home at dusk, they naturally felt very convenient. But some others suffered, and no one thought about it. Because the road was not solid and was completed hastily, the cars trampled on it, and the weak places gradually sank, while some places rose up. Adding a few heavy rains, the road became as rugged as a hillside. When cars drove on it, they swayed like boats floating in water. In severe cases, they would overturn, and accidents happened almost all the time. With a sudden diversion, the car body would jump up and drive straight into the shop, or perhaps kick straight past the bodies and stomachs of pedestrians before lying down. As a result, no one knew how many times car accidents had killed people, even though the highway had only been open for two or three months.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Vendor A Wu</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Speaking of vegetable vendor A Wu, he was somewhat famous in this market. He lived in Zhutiegou, more than ten li outside the city. Every day, he carried a full basket of vegetables to this market, arriving when the market was at its busiest. A Wu was not the only one doing vegetable business in this market; Since A Wu was famous, the other vegetable vendors could only resist by coming to the market early. But it was useless. The officials and gentry "ate fame". A Wu's vegetables were good, and they had to wait for A Wu. Therefore, before A Wu's vegetables were sold out, the other vegetable vendors couldn't expect to attract a customer.</p>
<p>"Hmph, A Wu's vegetables are fertilized with manure, and our vegetables are also fertilized with manure. It's not that his manure tastes particularly good!"</p>
<p>When those vegetable vendors couldn't do business, they deliberately raised their voices to satirize the "basket-carrying" customers. But the "basket-carrying" people were under orders from their masters. Their masters wanted to eat A Wu's vegetables, and they had no choice but to buy A Wu's vegetables. Although they heard those even filthier sarcastic remarks every day, they still rushed to buy A Wu's vegetables.</p>
<p>Seeing that business was good, A Wu brought out more vegetables every day. The vegetable business in this market was almost exclusively managed by him. In this way, there were no peaceful days in the market. At first, everyone fought verbally, and later, fights often occurred. Speaking of fighting, A Wu also had some skills, but the other vegetable vendors united, and A Wu was no match. Moreover, they came up with various methods to deliberately make trouble; Waiting for A Wu to carry the vegetables out, they would provoke him on the way. If A Wu retorted, the two sides would wrestle and fight, and the bystanders would dump his vegetable basket into the mud ditch.</p>
<p>A Wu had not been able to do business for several days. So he thought of a way to run to the officials' residences. Every day, he carried vegetables to the government offices, which the other vegetable vendors could not prohibit. However, there was still some good business to be done in the market.</p>
<p>On A Wu's side, he also had a special advantage, which was that he didn't have to share the profits with the "basket-carrying" middlemen. He could sell at a better price to the old gentlemen and ladies who liked to "eat fame." Although he let go of many customers, his income would not decrease.</p>
<p>But after a few months, A Wu's business scope became smaller and smaller. This was not because the other vegetable vendors had come up with any other methods to destroy him, but because A Wu himself was lazy. He always stayed in the homes of several familiar officials and gentry, chatting with the maids and cooks, chatting for a long time about everything under the sun. Sometimes, he would even help them with their chores. If people casually invited him to eat, he would sit at the table without any politeness, leaving the several officials' residences that he was supposed to deliver to behind. In this way, A Wu lost his credibility, and his customers gradually shifted to the other vegetable vendors in the market.</p>
<p>A Wu abandoned his good business, and his small fame made people suspicious; Especially the other vegetable vendors who were hostile to him. In the market, everyone would talk about this matter intentionally or unintentionally. Those "basket-carrying" people also let slip, saying: "Everyone's vegetables are the same, it's not like A Wu's are watered with ginseng soup!"</p>
<p>The vegetable vendors were pleased to do business:</p>
<p>"A Wu's manure is more fragrant than ours!"</p>
<p>Every day, A Wu was the center of conversation in the market.</p>
<p>But what was A Wu thinking? One day, a shocking new rumor spread through this small city—he had abducted a maid from an official's residence and fled.</p>
<p>The discussion in the market was:</p>
<p>"A Wu's vegetables are good? A Wu's ability to abduct women is even better!" While busy tying vegetables, the vegetable vendors echoed each other and laughed.</p>
<h3>Typhoon</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>In my hometown, typhoons are called "fengtai" (wind storm). A letter came from home saying that my hometown was hit by a typhoon again, and my worries were confirmed. For many days, newspapers had repeatedly published news of typhoons passing through, saying that the South Sea area had already been hit. At that time, I was very concerned about my hometown. I was thinking, don't let there be another typhoon again. I prayed for my hometown. Who knew that my suspicion would be confirmed? A letter came from home saying that many coconut trees had been blown down. The half-ripened rice ears were blown down in one direction, drooping and soaking in the water.</p>
<p>Typhoons are common in my hometown. They often occur between August and September. Hurricanes flying from the Philippines often blow through the northeast corner of my hometown, and then blow along the coast towards Taiwan to the east. Small typhoons are nothing much. If they are big, there will be disaster. Blowing down coconut trees is not much of a loss. Blowing away the rice and blowing away the roof tiles is a big loss. I remember there was a really big typhoon one year. I was still young at that time, and the wind blew so hard that I didn't dare to go out. I couldn't stand still. I really couldn't stand still in the wilderness. Coconut leaves more than ten feet long flew all over the sky, destroying many houses! Almost every household suffered. I remember the thatched hut of Black Auntie next to the village was crushed by a fallen coconut tree. Her little grandson, who was eight or nine years old, a child who had no parents from the moment he was born, was so pitiful, and died in the rubble pile! This destroyed Black Auntie's lifeline. No one would continue the ancestral incense. Although Black Auntie escaped from danger, she went crazy. She pointed to the sky and cursed all day long, with tears in her eyes. Now, the house that has been mostly collapsed is still there, and Black Auntie is still guarding that half-collapsed house, living a life that is neither alive nor dead, passing the days in prayer and cursing. Such a half-mad old woman is really miserable. When I think of her, I also point to the sky and curse. This makes me very afraid and concerned about my hometown. Don't let there be another flying disaster. I pray for my hometown.</p>
<p>Of course, if the wind blows too hard, every household will suffer, but small typhoons are quite interesting. Maybe it's because I felt it was very interesting when I was a kid and I liked it very much. Small typhoons don't cause much loss. This is quite like what someone said about illness; He said that one shouldn't be too sick, because if it's too bad, it's dangerous, and at least it will make your body and mind suffer enough. Small illnesses are interesting: there is not much loss, and you can also eat some good things and nourish yourself. This is great: you just lie down and browse some light publications, look at the various medicine bottles, and feel that little bit of desolate taste, which is quite poetic; saying that this is quite happy, I think maybe it's right. Typhoons are also like this. Small typhoons are quite interesting.</p>
<p>Small typhoons can even be said to be "fengli" (wind encouragement), but they are different from ordinary wind and rain, so they are called "fengtai" (wind storm). The difference is probably not in the size of the wind and rain, but in the taste. Typhoons have a typhoon taste. For example, tsunamis, with low and fast clouds, must be said to have a typhoon taste. Ordinary wind and rain may not have such a prelude. Tsunamis sound like muffled thunder from afar, with a deep and dull sound that is regular, sometimes far and sometimes near, and also a bit like hearing the sound of a large waterfall in the distance. Old people can hear the size of the typhoon from this sound. They understand the signs of the typhoon, and they are more worried than ordinary people. Watching the coconut leaves dance and listening to the sound of the tsunami, whether it is a small typhoon or a flying disaster, they are rarely happy. "The tsunami is very urgent," they worryingly look at the sky, and then they will calculate the harvest and hope that the clouds are thinner; Thinner, so that they can keep more hope in their hearts. Indeed, if the typhoon is smaller, their happiness is really hard to describe, just like getting back a lost and recovered valuable item. Their happiness is really not comparable to getting a small illness. This is the mood of the elderly. My liking for small typhoons is not calculated from the harvest; children's hearts are not willing to be lonely, and they want to play. Small typhoons will satisfy them. I remember when I was a child, when I occasionally encountered a small typhoon, I would often be so excited that I couldn't sleep at night, and I would even light a lantern in the middle of the night to pick up coconuts in the coconut grove. Thinking about it, this is very interesting. Hearing the sound of a coconut falling to the ground from afar, chasing the wind and storm, following the sound to find a rather heavy thing in the small bushes, this is a fun thing in the eyes of children. This is one thing. There are many more reasons to like small typhoons, such as listening to the sounds of nature on windy and rainy nights, watching the clouds and flowing water during the day, and the sky full of flying bamboo leaves, like swallows coming in spring; these things are deeply ingrained in my memory. Speaking of it, small typhoons are still gentle and friendly things.</p>
<p>But this time it's terrible, not so gentle. I'm afraid what's flying is not bamboo leaves but bamboo poles with roots. The letter from home only mentioned rice, and that's sad enough; although it may not be a flying disaster of flying tiles and collapsing houses, it seems that many people should be blaming the year again. But as long as it's not a flying disaster, it's still good.</p>

<p>Opening chapter "Qin Cao"</p>
<p>Willow Pavilion Water Crossing. Peach Blossom Song Fan Spring in the Mirror. A Glimpse of the Vast View of Ping Lake. Women like clouds kick soft dust. Boats carry romantic Su Scholar. He is a jade hall banished to Hangzhou. Official leisure and Qin Cao travel together. Famous is the number one person in Qinglou. Chewing flowers and blowing stamens laugh frequently. Carving the moon and cutting clouds remember new songs. Occasionally playful in the boat. I am the elder to examine Qing Qing. Qing tries to practice Zen and presents the precepts. Because to ask four or three are all good answers. Dongpo claps his hands and makes a loud voice. Desolate gate in old age. Why should Qiu Niang marry a merchant. Several words Qin Cao suddenly realize. Willing to shave hair into empty fight. Nine days will always be a flower fairy. The heart of Zen has been made into mud catkins. Those oblique winds and drizzle are not concerned. Incense burns and chants the Sanskrit mantra. All day long picking flowers to avoid guests. Clock fish Zen board knocks on Guanyin.</p>

<p>Opening chapter "Li Taibai"</p>
<p>In the past, Xichuan descended to the immortal. The long star entered the dream and produced Yingxian. Talent like the sea and writing like silk. Drunk crazy singing hundreds of poems. Just because he can recognize the words of the foreign country. Win the fame spread in the world. The holy decree summons. Not on the boat. Still sleeping in a tavern in Chang'an. No scruples in front of the emperor. Drunken eyes are dim near the emperor's face. He calls himself a wine fairy. Zhuanquan Lishi took off his boots. Favored concubine Yang held a stone inkstone. Glass cup bestowed with wine. Waving the brush and falling ink to seal clouds. Compose three Qingping tunes. Set into the pear garden in the music. Disaster caused by the sentences of Fei Yan's new makeup. Concubine Yang misunderstood the words of the talents. From then on, resigned and wandered outside. Tracing the traces of the rivers and lakes for many years. A seal of Dan Zhao descends from the sky. All yamen can receive wine money, pick up the moon and ride the whale at Caishiji. Not only the poem fairy is the national fairy. Taibai Qingshan is still there today. Clothes and crowns were buried on the river that day. To this day, the river is called the poet. Later generations still exist to sweep the grave. Who does not know Li Qinglian.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>"Casual Chat on Horseback" compiled by Master Ding Cong "Film Art One," the inaugural issue was published on the 20th, with rich and substantial content. Contributors include Zheng Yingshi, Tang Na, Chen Wulingxi, Shen Xiling, Ke Ling, Shu Yan, Sun Shiyi, Su Feng, Cai Chusheng, etc. Here is an excerpt from the journal's "News Clippings": "Some say that Diao Banhua's claim to leave the film industry was driven away by the teasing words of Zhong Doufu's friends. If so, those who made "teasing words" would have too disappointed the photographers who took the sensual photos for Diao and promoted her to "rise" in the film culture movement. However, there are no "bathing suit" photos in it, which may disappoint readers.</p>

<h3>Silver Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Yun Er</p>
<p>Wang Ying went to Beiping to appreciate the "Autumn of the North Country," and hasn't returned yet. There are two pieces of news: one says that she will return to Shanghai after the 25th in a few days, and the other says that Wang Ying will reside in Beiping and will not return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The screening rights for the Double Ten Festival's "Jin Cheng" have now been obtained by Diantong. The conditions for obtaining them are: Diantong will not compete with Lianhua for screening rights for Christmas, the Gregorian New Year, and the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>The editor of the "Ming Xing Half-Monthly" added a note on the "Words of the Author of Night Blooming Jasmine": "If the published text, except for Zhong Shu and Er Wei, is from their own hands, the other three are all written by a certain gentleman on their behalf because they are busy; but what is recorded is all their own opinions."</p>
<p>At a time when female stars are competing to write articles as an honor, the above note is really too "naive."</p>
<p>Following the "Ming Xing Half-Monthly," "Storm" by Yihua also featured a promotional manuscript of Yuan Meiyun's notes. Someone said: In the future, the "secretaries" of the stars will become public from secret; but if this is the case, won't "writer stars" like Diao Gong feel that there is no way out?</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "The Storm" and the Like</h3>
<p>— Wei Heling</p>
<p>I played a father in "The Beginning of Man," and I also play a father in "The Storm," as if I were born to be a father. In "The Beginning of Man," I had a lawsuit; in "The Storm," my family was ruined. Both were suffering fathers. Truly, in these hard times, being a father is difficult!</p>
<p>"The Storm" is staged in this peaceful autumn, but is the world as peaceful as this autumn?</p>
<p>On a gloomy day like this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, "The Storm" is perhaps more interesting than the silent, gossamer-like, and reticular drizzle!</p>
<p>Some people ask me my thoughts on acting in "The Storm," but I want to know what people think of "The Storm" in their hearts.</p>
<p>In these days of national peril, "The Storm" may not be entirely meaningless. I hope it can stir up a "storm" a little bigger than this in the hearts of sweet, drunken men and women, and then I will be satisfied.</p>
<p>I am waiting for a very blunt but serious criticism.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Oriental Drama Society</h3>
<p>The Oriental Drama Society, sponsored by the Moonlight Film Company, received over a thousand letters within five days of advertising for members. After reviewing and testing, Wan Laitian and Jin Shan, the two responsible persons, were busy day and night. Now the deadline has passed. According to Mr. Wan, the final decision will be made within days. The allocation of the twenty positions will be approximately twelve men and eight women. They will soon be notified to join the society for training, with the Moonlight Company fully providing room and board. It is also heard that their first public performance will be at a charity carnival, with the script already decided as "The Mute Wife" by [the French playwright] Frantosto.</p>
<h3>A Souvenir of a European Tour</h3>
<p>— Hu Die (Butterfly Wu)</p>
<p>"Night Blooming Cereus" is a very good souvenir for me personally.</p>
<p>Filming for "Night Blooming Cereus" began last winter. When it was only half finished, I had to put it on hold because I was going abroad to participate in the Soviet International Film Festival. It wasn't until I returned from my five-month European tour that I resumed work, and now the whole film is finally completed. —— I have unknowingly developed a great fondness for "Night Blooming Cereus" because it can be considered my European tour souvenir.</p>
<p>As for my acting in this film, although I worked harder and tried harder, I dare not say that I have achieved particularly good results. Naturally, after traveling to Europe, my horizons have broadened a lot, and my knowledge has also increased a lot; but to say that my acting has suddenly improved in a short time because of this trip would not be true. I only have this confidence: to use my life experience, the knowledge I gained from my travels, and sincere effort to enable my acting to make new progress.</p>
<p>Now "Night Blooming Cereus" is about to be released, and I look forward to the strict instructions of the audience. (This article is a retyped manuscript sent by Star [Film Company])</p>

<h3>The Achievement of Lihe Fearless Charcoal Vehicle is Excellent</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Mr. Maddy, General Manager of the American Maddy Motor Company, and Mr. Li Baohe of the China Coal Gas Machine Manufacturing Plant, in view of the great importance of using charcoal instead of oil, have made every effort to engage in research and exploration, hoping to improve and perfect it. Fortunately, it has been a great success. In the future, if the highways of various provinces use this new product as a means of transportation, in terms of economics, its cheapness and cost-effectiveness, compared with the use of gasoline, will be vastly different. Moreover, using charcoal as fuel will prevent money from flowing out, which is especially beneficial to the national economy.</p>
<p>This new product is a charcoal-for-oil furnace mounted on a specially constructed Lihe freight vehicle, named the Lihe Fearless Freight Vehicle. After repeated tests, it has been proven that this type of vehicle, whether in terms of economy or roadworthiness, has achieved excellent results. Its cost is less than one-fifth of that of gasoline. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau also used this vehicle for testing, and the results were very satisfactory and praised repeatedly. Recently, when the test was held in this city, Mr. Chen Ticheng of the Highway Department of the National Economic Commission also sent a letter of commendation, praising it not only for adding luster to charcoal vehicles, but also for opening a ray of dawn for the future of our country's highways.</p>
<p>The picture shows the Lihe Fearless Charcoal Vehicle. A group photo of the people who participated in the test held in this city recently. In the picture, from left to right, the third person is Mr. Pang Shite of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Lihe Automobile Company, the fourth person is Mr. Li Baohe, the sixth person is Mr. Chen Ticheng, Director of the Highway Department of the Economic Commission, and the eighth person is Mr. Maddy.</p>
<h3>Statistics of Road Vehicle Accidents in the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Pedestrians should bear half the responsibility</p>
<p>The issue of responsibility for road vehicle accidents. At first glance, it seems that drivers should bear more responsibility. But the fact is not always the case. According to the British Ministry of Transport, based on the road accidents obtained at the beginning of this year, and after careful analysis, it is known that pedestrians should also bear half the responsibility for vehicle accidents. It is not necessarily all the fault of the driver. The Ministry took a total of 1,500 accident cases for analysis and research. 2,532 people lost their lives as a result. Among them, pedestrians who should be held responsible for the accidents accounted for 49.1% of the total. Drivers accounted for only 25.1%.

Following a car illegally 31 cases. Pedestrians are responsible for the death of drivers in only 1.5% of cases. These drivers were all riding motorized bicycles. Drivers are responsible for the death of pedestrians in 11.4% of cases. On the other hand, the responsibility of drivers for the death of passengers in sidecars or sidecars reached 78.6%. Other passengers 56.7%</p>
<p>Of the 857 pedestrians who died, 259 (30.2%) were under the age of 15. 423 (49.4%) were 55 years of age and older. The most dangerous age for children is 5 years old (43 deaths). 6 years old (34 deaths). and 7 years old (33 deaths). The most dangerous age for adults is between 65 and 70 years old. (99 deaths) The most common cause of dangerous accidents for children is "running into the road." A total of 77 cases. "Emerging from the front or back of the car without closely observing the movement of vehicles." A total of 67 cases. Other analyses are as follows. (1) Those who died in the accident.

Drivers other than motorized bicycle riders 72 people, 4.8. (2) The nature of the accident. Vehicle collisions and collisions with pedestrians 842 cases, accounting for 56.1% of the total. Moving vehicle collisions 403 cases, 26.9. Those not caused by collisions 123 cases, 8.2. (3) The place where the accident occurred. Open straight roads and easily visible turns 918 cases, accounting for 61.2% of the total. At road intersections 456 cases, 30.4. 29 accident cases occurred at intersections with police direction or traffic lights. (3) Analysis of each car involved in the accident. Private cars accounted for 588 cases, accounting for 29.7% of the total. Motorized bicycles 275 cases, 13.9. Public streetcars 175 cases, 8.8. Large cars and freight cars 479 cases, 24.2.
