<p>— 上海市興業信託社</p>
<p>上海一埠。綺　繁華。初無名山。足資遊賞。耳目所接。鬧市高樓。探勝尋幽。是蓋難言之矣。然而上海雖不足以言山。於水則有高橋之海濱。炎炎長夏。溽暑逼人。　適胸懷。其惟於此地求之乎。</p>
<p>高橋西擁浦江。東瀕大海。形勢絕勝。海濱地勢坦平。沙灘廣袤。爲一天然海水浴塲。曩者有一二西僑。偶赴海濱。遂以發現。嗣因輪渡交通。愈形便捷。汽車經行。倐息直達。中西仕女。遂聯袂往遊。一時稱盛。惟往昔係由商人承辦。房舍簡陋。設備未周。飲饌之需。難當人意。遊者引以爲憾。今歲收歸市辦。由本社承乏其事。於是鳩工庀材。大加整理。殫精竭慮。未敢怠荒。迅速施工。爲期二月。茲者有膳堂。可容四百人。中西茗點。務期精潔。有池沼。可以盪漿。一葉扁舟。中流容與。其沙灘之夾雜瓦礫者篩理之，。其道途之顚簸難行者平坦之。他若設置淋浴室。以重淸潔。植立水位誌。以策安全。租賃篷帳浴衣。以便遊侶。裝設通滬電話。以靈消息。蓋無不爲游人着想者也。歐美各國。吸引游客。多於便捷交通。設備舒適二者注意。本社不敏。竊願於高橋海濱小試其端焉。</p>
<p>高橋海濱。匪特爲遊覽區也。抑且空氣澄新。可以攝生。海水沐港。足鍊體魄。氣溫不高。兼宜消夏。再有進者。滬上人士。以炎夏肆虐。向多這暑他方。其實夏日長征。舟車勞頓。良亦非計。今者高橋海濱。尙多隙地。本社爲滬人謀消夏之區。可代籌建簡單別墅。却暑攝生。此爲最適。自滬前往。爲程極短。一時餘卽達。水色天光。撲人眉宇。中西仕女。聯襼褰裳。必一往淸遊也。</p>
<p>今日高橋海濱浴塲開慕。辱承諸君子惠臨垂敎。曷勝榮幸。敢贅一言。用爲道謝。</p>

<p>整理沙灘</p>
<p>高橋海濱浴塲沙灘。原爲一種明凈細砂。光潔可愛。惟雜有石子。且高低不平。殊欠完美。今年第一步。卽將沙灘石子檢出篩過。將細沙舖平。另舖黃沙。行走其上。如履地氈。柔滑細緻　舒適異常。絕無汚泥沾染。</p>
<p>安全設備</p>
<p>高橋海灘。坡度極平。近岸一里之內。水深僅及腰部。故雖不諳水性者。亦無危險。天然形勢。殊不易得。然爲力謀安全起見。在此較水深區域。設立標誌。潮水漲落。均有鈴號。並懸旗幟。故安全方面。可吿無虞。</p>
<p>淋浴沖洗</p>
<p>往年該處浴塲最大缺點。在無淸水冲洗。致游客游泳後。鹹永沾身　至覺不適。今年特斥巨資。建造最新式之水池水塔及淋南浴　　滿　白磁磚。安置冷熱淸水龍頭。以便游客淋浴之用。淸潔衛生。實無倫比。</p>
<p>食堂設備</p>
<p>往年浴塲。僅有草屋數椽。游客浴後。無舒適之地。可資休息或進膳。今年建有大規模會食堂。可容四百人進膳之用。上蓋翠綠西班牙式屋瓦。四周圍以鋼窗。至爲軒朗。極日遠眺。水天一色。景色絕佳。內部設備。與一般飯店逈不相同。蓋浴塲之食堂。在進膳之際。尙含有休息作用。故坐椅一律用特製之帆布椅。務使游客身心。無處不感覺舒適。而價目之低廉。猶其餘事。</p>
<p>中西飲食</p>
<p>浴塲食堂各種飲食。槪由市輪渡自行辦理。</p>
<p>甲，西餐完全採用法國式。質量均經精選豐富。每日午晚菜單與市輪渡所辦水上飯店相同。</p>
<p>乙，各式西點冷飲美酒。無不盡備。</p>
<p>丙，揚州道地點心麵餃。淸潔適口。並採辦揚州特製醬油及鎭江滴醋。用料及烹製。均經長時期之研究。務求適合暑天口胃。淸潔衛生。尤極注意。至價値方面。比上海一般飲食店爲廉。更屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>其他設備</p>
<p>浴塲往年僅有草屋數椽。布置因漏就簡。不但辜負天然景色。且有碍衛生。今年建有男女更衣室多間。布置井然。組織嚴密。並由男女職員分任職務厠所。特採用一九三五年式最新衛生設備。並備有定製毛織游泳衣。從廉出租。此外有蓬帳一百數十付。任客租用。單雙舖凉房十數間。供客住宿。水電電話。無不齊備。故對於公務繁忙之游客。隨時可與浦東西及特區各處直接通話。</p>
<p>浴塲環境</p>
<p>浴塲東臨大海。大然地位。巳極優越、人工方面，今年特開闢湖沼一處。中建湖心亭。界以長堤。架以木橋。並有廣大陰沉之走道。植樹四千餘株。舖草地五百餘方。更有各種盆景花草。花木扶蘇。綠茵如錦。與碧海靑天相　映　美景無窮。卽不游。泳者前往散步。亦足以　　胸襟。　　　　性。</p>
<p>空氣及溫度</p>
<p>海濱空氣之淸鮮澄潔。夫人而知。固無庸贅述。而夏季之海風。無時或息。其功用更能使皮膚毛孔收縮。增加身體抵抗力。至海濱溫度。通常比上海約低華氏十度。故前往避暑納凉。至屬相宜。</p>
<p>特添晚間返滬專班</p>
<p>往年除星期六及星期日外。浴塲方面游人。未見踴躍。因有職務者公餘之後前往。僅能游玩一小時。卽須返滬。殊難盡興。茲以市輸渡船隻增加。自本日起無論風雨。每日晚間十時由高橋特開返滬專班一次。準十一時抵達北京路碼頭。如此可有數小時之流覽而不妨碍次日之職務。茲擬定游程如次。</p>
<p>（一）每日午後五時。自北京路碼頭乘市輪渡出發。</p>
<p>（二）六時半到達海濱浴塲。</p>
<p>（三）游泳晚餐散步。</p>
<p>（四）九時四十分自浴塲乘專車搭專輪返滬，十一時到北京路碼頭。</p>
<p>水上交通</p>
<p>市輪渡　原有長渡渡輪五艘。（一至五號）以四輪行駛上海至吳淞航綫。一輪作爲備船。乃近年來每逢夏季。往高橋吳淞等處游沐者如雲。而尤以星期或假日更形擁擠。故抽調備船。加駛班次。仍威不敷。復以乘凉夜班及各方租用渡輪。以及各海輪公司租輸接送乘客等，需要日增。爰卽趕造新輪一艘。編爲第六號。該輪構造大小。與五號渡輪相髣。而材料之堅固。馬力速率。裝璜仍在五號渡輸之上。且上層特等艙前部。裝以銅窗。視天氣之冷煖。隨時可以啟閉調節。七月一日。卽加入滬淞綫行駛。游客衆多時。幷作加班或開專班之用。其速度每小時在十二海里以上。自高橋至上海。僅需四十分鐘可達。故今年水上交通。可不再虞擁擠。游客之舒適便利。較之曩時。當不可同日語矣。</p>
<p>陸上交通</p>
<p>由高橋市輪渡碼頭至海濱浴塲。自通行公共汽車以來。乘客巳便利甚多。惟尙覺車輛缺少。與道路不平。今年關於車輛方面。除將原有之公共汽車六輛重加整理漆新外。更添備新車四輛。加入行駛。以適應需要。道路方面。巳由工務局將一部分較爲狹仄之處放寬。橋樑亦改造加闊。並自備滾路機。常川滾壓路面。務使車行其上。平穩迅速。絕無顚簸之弊。浴塲門口候車處。加設木柵。依購票先後按次上車。以免爭先擁擠。故今年之陸上交通。巳達完備之境矣。抑尤有進者。往年銅人碼頭。本社無權管轄。秩序淩亂。且上無棚頂。購票候船。飽受露晒之苦。自北京路雙層浮碼頭淤一月間完成以來。前此不便之處。均已完全解除。故任何游客。乘坐任何艙位。自到達北京路碼頭起。直至回抵北京路碼頭止。隨時隨地。均可儘量享受。於　鋉體魄之中。仍無處不顧及游客之舒適。恐樂不思歸者。大有人在也。</p>
<p>避暑別墅</p>
<p>浴塲範圍內有空地數千畝。擬建臨時避暑別墅若干宅。供滬人士消夏之用。藉省遠赴他方避暑。而免長途跋涉之勞。此項避暑別墅。祗須擇定地點。可由本社代爲建築。訂約出租。式樣大小。任憑自定。水電齋備。有意承租者。請惠臨上海天津路六十六號上海市興業信託社接洽。</p>

<p>往海濱浴塲行程。由北京路外難市輪渡雙層碼頭乘市渡輪至高橋。乘公共汽車直達浴場。其費用約計如下。</p>
<p>一、較爲舒適者乘市渡輪特等艙每人船費八角。車費二角。來回共二元</p>
<p>二、較爲節省者乘市渡輪頭等艙海人船費四角。車費二角。來回共一元二角。</p>
<p>三、最經濟者乘市渡輪二等艙每人船費一角四分。車費二角。來回共僅六角八分。</p>
<p>以上三項。北京路碼頭均有來回船車四聯票發售。異常簡便。凡購船車聯票者。並贈海濱浴塲入門劵一張。</p>
<p>四、團體往遊者可先期函達市輪渡管理處（天津路六六號）核發購買團體票允許證。憑證至碼頭購團體票。單程照價七折。來回六折收費。惟祗以渡嘛爲限。公共汽車無團體票。</p>

<h3 id="c19">政府救濟錢業之成效 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 崔</p>
<p>財政部爲救濟錢業。於本月八日。指撥二十四年金融公債二千五百萬元。以資抵押救濟。此項抵借事宜。業已完全告竣。際此通貨緊縮之時。得有此鉅額資金之流通。金融業當可漸趨坦途矣。</p>
<p>今日金融風潮之成因。由於通貨緊縮。而通貨緊縮。以人心不安定爲之厲階。錢莊一業以有悠久之歷史。於工商界方面較爲深入。其營業方針。亦偏重於工商業之信用放欵。近年因一般工商業之不景氣。遂使貸出之欵項不能如期收轉。致於資金之運用方面。未能圓轉如意。然其內容。實頗穩健。是以當局經錢業代表之請求。卽毅然有撥借金融公債之救濟辦法。此固爲對錢業周急之舉。實亦藉以普惠一般工商業也。</p>
<p>此次錢業之抵借情形。據調查所得。上海全部匯劃錢莊凡五十五。其已實行抵借者不及半數。而抵借情形。有未足額渚。有已簽署而未抵借者。可知財部當局苦心救濟以來。人心之空虛。卽已消除。金融之供需。亦日趨安定矣。</p>
<p>此次錢業風潮之消弭。一方固賴財部當局之撥欵救濟。派員監理。謀治標之方法。一方亦賴銀錢兩業領袖。於通力合作安定金融以外。復力謀兩業間之互爲周轉。共存共榮。此種恊調精神。實至偉大而可貴。蓋本年金融狀態之不安定。爲辛亥以來所僅有。其人心空虛之程度。且駕辛亥情形以上。苟無此種精神以補救之。則危機必將日益加深也。</p>
<p>抑金融事業。植基於百凡工商業之上。工商業之盛衰。卽爲金融業之盛衰。反之。亦惟金融業之組織健全。方能以全力扶植工商業。使進於繁榮之途。觀於近日銀錢兩業之努力於工商業小借欵。可證此說之不謬。近來規模較大之銀行錢莊。已與政府取一致之步驟。今者錢業困難。又一旦消除。當此形勢好轉之時。凋敝已久之工商業當可有回蘇之望矣。</p>

<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>在淸季光緒初年，士子醉心科舉之時代；其蹭蹬棘闈，屢試不售之士人，往往設館授徒，訓蒙餬口。其中頗有英雋之才，埋沒窮巷甕戶中，結詩社，攻古文，以銷磨無憀之歲月。而以書畫自遣者，亦不乏其人。</p>
<p>吾邑梅友竹先生調鼎，品性高潔，書名聞海內。家貧，設帳餬口。家中無僮僕，有友詣其家，柴門閉然自闢，往往見先生道貌岸然，懸腕書楹聯，歐神王髓，殆同神品。有疑柴門何以自闢者，久之，方知先生有女，秀外慧中，工詩善書，每聞剝啄聲，輒起啟關，卽隱身門後，而納客之入也。</p>
<p>先生精神矍鑠，淸腴瀟洒，性和易，喜與小兒游。予六七歲時，先生與先叔祖父交甚篤，時來予家，輒抱予令寫字。後憶先王母言：先生每寫屏聯時，輒令我姑母持紙，蓋我姑母亦知書也。先生喜食茶葉雞蛋，每度非十餘枚不飽。又嗜粢飯，食後且言且行曰：「我能飛也！我能飛也！」而此時之書法尤佳。</p>
<p>先生家貧，每屆年關，輒來海上。巨商達官，聞其名者，羣匄其書。先生或應，或不應。有贈以裘衣者，佯請先生試衣之，笑曰；此衣大合先生體格，先生母庸重購，庶免鑿柄之不相入也。先生一笑納之。先生旣歸，鬻字之金，源源而來，而先生之年關，遂安然以度。</p>
<p>一日先生過四馬路，見粉白黛綠者，絡繹於道。先生於羣雉擁擠中，高聲呼曰：「孃孃！孃孃！」（甬語：讓讓路也。）聞者莫不大笑。</p>
<p>先生書法，至今流傳甚少，寸縑尺素，得者珍若瓖寳；輓近百餘年來，海內書家，實無出其右者也。</p>
<h3 id="c157">木魚 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 張翊德</p>
<p>現在社會裏，舊式婦女所最喜歡的文學，還是「鼓兒詞」和「彈詞，」因爲高尙美妙的文學，不能使她們威到興趣，祇有「鼓兒詞」和「彈詞纔能感動她們的心絃，纔能使舊式婦女們無意識地犧牲了多少眼淚。</p>
<p>可是廣東婦女愛好的「彈詞」和普通的不很對，她們別立一個名詞呌做「木魚。」「木魚」的差異點，是沒有彈詞那麼長，也沒有彈詞那麼枝枝節節的說白；要是拿一個例準準對一下，彈詞便是長篇的章回小說，木魚便是短篇的小品文藝。雖然木魚也有純粹的說理和抒情，但這只是極小的一部分，那大宗的還是像故事詩的體裁。</p>
<p>無論你走到那裏，只消在廣州市的範圍裏，都可以使你聽到舊式婦女在工作時或閑談時唱出來的這種聲調。若是你遇到一個熟識的奮式婦女，問伊「你會唱木魚麼？」那麼伊準會這樣回答你；「會是會的，不過我唱得不十分好。」結果便把「夫喪黃泉淚未收，淸明節近又添愁，準備紙帛前往墳頭燒，免敎冷落這山幽……」流行的雪梅祭墳的木魚唱給你聽了。</p>
<p>伊們唱的木魚，並沒有一定的節拍和高低，只隨着字音宛轉地唱去，有時伊們唱得起勁了，在唱那悲哀凄凉的地方，便會把蘊蓄在心坎深處的情愫，隨着音調，嗚嗚咽咽的流露出來了。</p>
<p>木魚中的詞多半用廣東的方言編成，而且是婦女口吻。詞情也多半傾向於凄凉悲苦的一方面，詞句更愁慘，不忍卒聞，所以當你在總伊們唱木魚的時候，心田裏的傷戚，已形諸於辭色之間了。</p>

<p>都市的夜，不像鄉村那樣的沉寂，而守着紀律似的樸素。燦爛繽紛的霓紅燈，染着血腥似的躱在市招上或墻角上一閃一閃的霎着眼睛。光影下疾馳的，是瘋狂的新世紀的機械；什麼一九三四年型的「司丟培格」，「黑蒲馬皮」，一九三五年型的「克雷斯勒」，「潑萊摩斯」以及……蜿　地長列陣似的在光滑平坦的柏油道上極流利的向着華麗堂皇的火山進行，一次，二次……交織着。</p>
<p>穿着西式號衣的小西崽，把「克羅米」的玻璃門拉開了，讓那些牽着紳士們手的妖媚的露西亞姑娘進去，於是他們踏着這大理石花岡石建的平地上，步子輕快的，一大串，一大串，把裏面擠了個滿坑滿谷。</p>
<p>音樂台上開始奔放音樂的旋律，於是這般世紀以外的情侶，脚底下在光滑的地板上緩緩地跟着音樂溜着。舞啦，吻啦，緊抱啦，那醉人的，動人的美處，經士們享受着，欣賞着。</p>
<p>休息的時候，東也砰，西也砰，火山的空氣中倥惚地充溢了緊張的情緒——把啤酒，香檳的蓋子狂飛着。</p>
<p>露西亞姑娘和紳士們同提着高脚杯和高脚杯，裏面的葡萄美酒，陶醉在笑聲和淫邪可恣態中！</p>
<p>音樂台上二十幾次奔放着音樂的旋律，每個人的脚底下也在光滑的地板上緩緩地溜着。</p>
<p>散塲一到，那新世紀的機械，又很流利地在柏油道上活躍起來；有幾個露西亞姑娘，却隨着紳士們，去做着粉紅色的夢。</p>
<p>因此，煩囂而熱鬧的火山，終於沉寂起來了！</p>

<p>第二十九章　御醫</p>
<p>我們一直在湖上逗留着，誰都不覺得厭倦，幾乎玩到下午五六點鐘模樣，天色巳將黑下來之後才歇。我因此就　到一個機會，向太后請問伊方才所說的「造化小兒」究竟是怎樣的一會事。伊本來早就知道我是一個最愛發問的人，伊自己又是一個最愛給人家解釋一切的人，於是伊的答復便絕不躊躇的在微笑之中帶出來了。</p>
<p>「正正經經的講起來，這也不過是一種很怪僻的信仰！這種信仰，就是說：人們一定不可過於快樂，如其你過於的快樂了，冥冥之中就會有一個類似神仙的人物，會在你毫不提防之際，狹然的降到你身上來，使你發生種種的不快樂。也可以說使人們感到不快樂的一件事，就是這位神仙應盡的一種職責。因為如其沒有它在播弄著的話，人們將恣意的作樂，一些不知道痛苦和憂患是怎樣的滋味了，所以它是終年在工作着的，如其你已戚覺到十分的舒適安逸了，造化小兒就會走來把你弄得馬上感覺到不安逸，不舒服起來；或者你正在趾高氣揚，興致勃；的當兒，它又會走來把你弄得一天高興，化爲烏有。它的肚子裏簡直是裝滿着許多和人家惡作劇的資料，無論一件什麼事情，正爲很順利很平穩地進行的中間，總不免要給它走來搗亂幾次的，因此天下便决無眞正順利平穩的事情。（三四六）</p>

<p>第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人</p>
<p>最後一句，他的聲音是非常之大，可以知道他，下了極大的决心。北海聽到這話，緊緊的咬了牙齒。兩隻手捧着的報紙，嗤的一聲，竟是自動的裂開了。這是旅館裏預備的報紙，只得放下了，找着了一個茶房，說是願意賠償損失。他如此說了，茶房自然也就不便要他賠償，說句不値什麼，也就完了。可是只這幾句說話的工夫，北海回頭看時，那兩個女人都巳走去。揣想着，必是那胡嫂子回家去，討論月英的身價去了。雖然自己和月英，並沒有什麼友誼，可是在人情上說，覺得這樣好的一個姑娘，到底是把這身子給賣了，實在有些不忍。至於這幾天，腦子裏所搆成的那個幻影，終於是很快的成了幻影，這又不必說了。心裏旣是很忍耐不住這件事，一點也不考量，向程志前屋子裏直奔了去。志前也正在看書，見他氣冲冲的跑進來，手上拿了書望着他，倒有些發呆。北海在房門口就站定了，紅着臉道：程先生，我看這件事，太豈有此理！志前也紅了臉，站起來道：你怎麼呌起我來，說豈有此理？我呌你來補課，並無惡意。而且來與不來，聽憑你自己，你怎麼對我說出這種話來。說着，將手上的書，向桌上一板。北海站着頓了一頓，才笑道：呵！程先生，你誤會了。是在我面前，看到一件事，覺得太豈有此理，特意來報吿你的。我那能那棵不識好歹，敢脫程先生。（二四六）</p>

<h3 id="c161">一個被殘殺的女性（下） <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 尤愛梅</p>
<p>在　塲風波的遠　中，伊自己怎樣呢？唉！伊是幾經磨鍊成功的，毫無抵抗意識和能力的弱者！依然祇有背人一哭罷了！</p>
<p>就在這年的秋天，伊出閣了。記得歸寗的那天，先父從伊家回來，對我母親慨嘆著道：「唉！慶璋這孩子，太是老實可憐了」！我便挿口問先父：「這話是什麼意思」？才知道伊在嫁後第二夜，伊的丈夫，向伊獻媚，特地將從前那情侶贈他的照片，拿來在伊的面前撕毀掉了；並且，向著伊懺悔了一番，又道：「我們的婚期，要是稍早兩年的話，我便不致於有前次的失足了」。伊歸寗時，私下裏把這些話，巴巴地吿訴伊母親，心裏似乎很是滿意。唉！那裏知道，這叫做得新忘舊，這種人，是最靠不住的呢？先父閱歷深沉，所以這樣慨　著說啊！</p>
<p>兩三年來，我的家境，愈趨愈下，前年冬天，先父又棄養了；生活的擔子，壓上了我的肩頭，終年在外面東奔西走，圖謀衣食。所以，對於伊的廳境，不很淸楚。去年憂天，我失業回家，可巧伊也在城上，住在娘家。這時，伊已懷著身孕了。有一次，我見著伊，伊忽然對我說：想送我家裏去，看看我母親。我回去對母親說了，母親便也打算接伊來談談。不過，在伊嫁後，還沒曾到我家來過，按照俗例，要辦全席欵待，不能讓伊吃家常便飯的，而我的經濟，却正鬧著恐慌。祇好向伊推說：「天氣熱不過，等凉爽點，再接你來玩吧」。但沒多幾天，伊已回到鄉下，那知這次別後，我們竟成永訣了呢？秋間我聽說伊已經生下一個男孩子，但又風聞伊的丈夫，巳經變心，對伊常有虐待的舉動了。雖然不免替伊扼腕，却想不到在這短短的半年之間，伊丈夫對伊的態度，一天天地變本加厲，結果，竟會把伊打得遍體是傷啊！論理，這樣的環境，自有許多具體的辦法，來對付的。然而，那些辦法，像伊這樣的性情，像伊這樣的意志，怎能够想到，做到？何况，娘家的家庭，是頑固的；實應的社會，是封建的；它們的立塲，同時是在舊禮敎領導之下的。又怎能容許伊呢？如其不然，何待今日？在嫁前起著風波的時候，倒不會眼睜睜的，將伊推墮進火坑裏來啦！於是，伊祗有目傷薄命，就以三尺白綾，輕輕地了却伊才經過二十三年的靑春。</p>
<p>唉！死者巳矣！夫復何言！而尤其値得痛心的，是我悵望著家鄉，那兒還有許多司憐的女性，和伊是同病相憐的弱者，也正屈伏於舊　敎的支配，忍受著封建社會的制裁，在暗隅裏痛惜著，等著它們來殘殺哩！</p>
<p>附錄　予草此文旣竟，猶有餘悲，情何可已，哭之以聯，茲並附錄於後。</p>
<p>舊事忍重提。　角偕遊。及笄問字。與我情若同胞。遠道何堪驚惡耗。</p>
<p>遇人悲不淑。白綾三尺。黃土一坏。憐姊死難瞑目。夜台誰爲訴煩寃。</p>

<h3 id="c209">新式金屬真空管之介紹 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 夢頻</p>
<p>眞空管攀着進化的梯子，一層一層的上進，到了現在已經和牠祖先的形狀完全不同了。最近美國通用電器公司製成一種金屬眞空管，形體較通常玻璃管爲小，牠的外面有一層金屬殼子、除能作隔離罩外，還具有下列數種優點，就是構造堅固，散熱迅速，內部容量减低，造價經濟等等。</p>
<p>這類眞空管，據說現在已造成十種不同的式樣，其中有强力整流管，三極輸出管，可變係數五極管，（Variable　upentode）五柵極變流管（Pentogrid　converter），以及亦極管（Hexode），最末一種是由一隻小型三極管和一隻孿生二極管所合組，具有兩個陰極，和雙孿屏極（Duo-plate），但牠的高度（燈腰以上的高度）不過只有　英寸。</p>
<p>這種新式眞空管的燈座，比從前的燈座也進步了一些，不論眞空管的燈脚多少，都能挿入一隻同樣八脚燈座內，因爲燈脚的粗格完全一樣，相距有一定間隔、在眞空管正中、有一隻大脚，上面裝好鍵子（Key），如果我們要把管子挿入燈座時，只須先將大脚挿入燈座中間的大洞內，然後慢慢旋轉眞空管，等大脚上的鍵子墜入相當槽內時，再將眞空管挿下，這樣一來，沒有像通常眞空管須認淸燈脚粗細的煩麻、所以就是在里暗處所、也能把眞空管挿入座內，而不致發生錯誤，燈脚的數目、除應具有者外，還多出一隻，這一隻是通外面隔離罩的，所以燈座上相當洞內的彈簧應該通地。</p>
<p>這些眞空管，因爲內部沒有玻璃支柱的關係，構造簡單得多，又因爲各極接頭都從下端底板引出，所以引綫短而堅固，內部容量（Internal　Capacity）也因之减低不少。至於牠的製造方法、却和通常不一樣，這裏是　由下端底板着手，等各極裝好後，引綫由底板穿出，在引綫未穿出以前，底板洞內銲上一種合金製成的小圈，這種合金是專門製成以適合這裏需要的，牠的名字呌（Fernicc）福鎳鈷，由鐵，鎳，鈷三種金屬合成、膨脹係數和玻璃一樣。引出綫穿過一顆細玻璃珠，再把這玻璃珠溶在合金圈內。</p>
<p>眞空管的外殼，是由I158英寸厚的鐵皮製成，作隔離的用處，在外殼裏面，還有一層圓筒，相當於普通眞空管的玻璃罩，這層圓筒和底板的接合，是利用電銲原理，把20,000安培的强烈電流通過上面　秒鐘，圓筒週圍和底板就很密切的銲牢了，銲好後，經過排除空氣手續，眞空管的構造已算大致就緒、至於管內沒有抽凈的空氣，不能依照通常方法。用高週率誘導綫圈法（High-frepuency　induction　coil　method）來處理，應有强烈氣體火焰來把牠燒到發紅就行了。</p>
<p>上述的金屬眞空管，市上還沒有銷售，不過在美國通用電氣公司經營的各種全波收音機內，聽說就要採用這些新出品了。</p>

<p>— 泡</p>
<p>一本德文雜誌Funk-Technische　Monatsliefte　Magazine上講起一伴令人興奮的新出品，就是德國羅威公司（D.S.Loewe　Co.,　Germany）製造的，一套具有十二枚挿脚的複作用眞空管。</p>
<p>這樣的眞空管有二個特點：第一，眞空管中除去原有的屏極柵極燈絲之類外，有時還有耗阻器電阻器之類聯接在內，譬如柵漏式檢波眞空管，則柵漏（Grid　leak）及柵極固定電容器，製造時已連接於眞空管中，使配用於收音機中時特別簡單。第二，不論何號眞空管一律有十二枚挿脚，譬如某號眞空管僅需九枚挿脚，則多餘的三校挿脚卽空出不用，因此不論何號眞空管，可以配用同一的管座。（我國自製眞空管時，此點頗可効法）又眞空管的底座上，有三枚突出物，使挿入管座時不致挿錯。</p>
<p>這類複作用眞空管除去燈絲是公用外，其餘各極完全獨立，使用時無異於二隻或三隻分開的眞空管。現在巳出品的有下列四種：甲，射電週率五極管及廉柵極檢波管（　漏及電容器已連接在管內）。乙，射電週率五極管及二極檢波管及簾桐極四極管，丙，五極混合管及三極發振管及五極中週放大管。丁，射電週率五極管及簾柵極檢波管及五極强力放大管。上面幾種中，丙種專供無極外差式之用，丁種則大可以用於一隻眞空管放揚聲器的收音機中。</p>

<p>——12A7複式眞空管之新應用—</p>
<p>本刋七十一期中載有明襄先生大作「收音機唱機接續器」一稿，此機之作用實爲一小電力之發射機，作者也因感興趣而倣製一具，以零件關係，振盪管用直流的三十三號，効力頗佳，惟耗電甚鉅耳—</p>
<p>這裏所介紹的，僅應用新式複作用眞空管127一枚製成，作振盪兼整流，據試騐，成績與前二者相仿，惟零伴設備極少，且電源取自交直流，故使用便利，管理簡單，最合愛好經濟的同志　一試。</p>
<p>附圖，卽爲此接續器之綫路，全機置於一金屬匣內並通地以防發射之電波騷擾鄰近之收音機，丙電壓乃由屏極電流與簾柵極電流經R降壓而得，R用變量耗阻，作爲調節式，較固定者爲佳。</p>
<p>使用時，將此器之A，G雨瑞，各與收音機之天綫地綫柱相接，更將此器控制柵極與陰極連接，（如圖中虛綫X），調節收音機至岑寂處（無電台一點）然後調節此器中之變量，電容器C至司一拆去X虛綫，接上拾音器卽可矣！（惟須注意拾音器應用高混合咀力者，不然則須接一變壓器。）應用零件。</p>

<p>— 嚴菁志</p>
<p>無綫電之友會在每年冬天集會一次。討論技術上的問題。幷對敎授要求。給予他們充分的課程。多數的「短波部」爲要報吿他們實騐的結果和活動的成績、都　行「業餘者短簡」（Ham　Sbeet）。這雜誌爲業餘者珍視。Q符號，以及一般業餘者的略號也用俄文一併寫在這上面。</p>
<p>最通行的而且擁有最多數謂者的無綫　雜誌是「無綫電前綫」（Radio　Front）這雜誌一月出版二期，內容有短波欄，記載對業餘者特別有興味的文宇。有技術欄。以及關於無綫電消息，和業餘局等等記載。</p>
<p>把會員們的東西裝置在俱樂部或者團體裏是很普通的。因爲裝置機器的費用是沒有的。所以能過普通生活的人民，都能自己設置。支付的錢幣，都用對外沒有交換價値的政府流通紙幣，國內的勞動者呌做，海帕，盧布」。因此，重要的機器。都必須使用國內的出品，另件像電表之類也都能自己製造了。業餘者之間都用他們自己做出來的東西。</p>
<p>街上，無綫電商店很多，出賈另件及各種附屬品，有許多東西是很新的，有許多則極舊。</p>
<p>收音機普通是用再生檢波的。揚聲器裝在店門口的情形，也時常可以看到。聽廣播的很少，大部份都作宣傳用，將別是在大的火車站上。收音機大槪是簡單設計的二管式或三管式。再生檢波和一級低放的二管機是很普通的，三管機大槪是再加一級可調諧的高周率放大　。</p>
<p>發射機還有使用非常簡單式樣的。用晶體控制的業餘者也很多。式樣大部份是用格子棚式的或者是配電板（Panel）式。發射眞空管大槪用二十華脫到一百五十華脫。天綫一般是採用美國式的單綫饋電式。</p>
<p>從去年六月一起，全蘇業餘者改正地域，他們的呼號也改過了。</p>
<p>業餘局的聽用是靠很少捐稅，這稅裏，包含一些接特捐。此外，電報的拍發和接收，都要經過「短波部中央局」和地方短波部轉遞。與他國通信。是採用「萬國業餘者聯盟」的用語。就是國內業餘者相互間的通訊，也有用該用語的。如「ＴＣＦ」是普通電報的意思，在蘇聯是用作ＱＳＯ（通信）的意思。</p>
<p>最後把廣播台的情形，也簡單說一說，在莫斯科北部三十五公里的地方，有莫斯科廣播電台，用十六個五萬華脫水冷式眞空管。天綫電力約十萬華脫，最後級是採用B級放大方式的。</p>
<p>在同一的屋子裏，還設着一隻二萬華脫的發報機。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c215">全盤西化？殖民地化？ <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>中國在帝國主義侵略中的一個事實，雖然胡適博士從前把它看作海外奇談，但到現在是無人不承認了。關於侵略的方式，歐美一派貪圖金錢，主張把中國變成經濟的殖民地；東洋一派更貪圖土地，所以又主張把中國變成政治的殖民地。至於中國內爲帝國主義文化（即西洋文化）宣傳的一派，則比前兩派還進一步主張把中國變成文化的殖民地。他的口號呌做全盤西化。</p>
<p>前一派奪我們的市場，中一派奪我們的土地，後一派則奪我們的精神。所謂奪拉們的精神，用一句舊話，就是奪我們的人心。把這三派的利害得失比較一下，後一派最凶猛。因爲帝國主義交化支配我們的意識之後，那就到人心已死的境地，永不能翻身了。胡適不懂得帝國主義這一類抽象名詞，而在主觀和客觀上都替它辯護，就是他的意識帝國主義化了的緣故。</p>
<p>所以全盤西化論是思想界投降帝國主義論，是文化的殖民地化論。</p>
<p>此說的始作論者，是歐美國際帝國主義之物質的和精神的支柱所造出的國際學者胡適。這只要一看他的「我們對於西洋近代文明的態度」一文便可明白。到今天，繼起的有陳序經和梁實秋等。他們更進一步主張抹殺中國自巳，說它只能模倣帝國主義文化。梁實秋更明白說我們不能創造，主張創造就是誇大狂（大公報本年六月九日）。這無異於說中國人只配給帝國主義文化當洋奴買辦。</p>
<p>如此，那末我們的介紹工作錯了麼？這在從前是進步的，有文藝復與的價値；在現在，一一九二七」以後，便是保守的東西了。而在根本的意義上，過夫有創造的價値，相對的），並且（對於絕對的創造講來）是作爲手段看的；在現在，則甘於介紹，反對創造起來。</p>
<p>這樣的介紹，就沒有文化的啟蒙運動的意思，而是一種文化的殖民地化的意思。中國人底意識不應該獨立自由地創造，只可以隸屬於西洋。</p>
<p>但是，依你的，中國可以創造文化麼？可以。十八世紀的法國，比當時的英國落後。他們介紹洛克，却造出比洛克澈底的認識論；介紹牛頓，却造出比牛疑完美的世界觀。十八九世紀間的德國，比當時的英法爲落後，然而却出現了康德，菲希特，謝林格，黑格爾等大哲學家和馬克思，恩格斯等大思想家。二十世紀的俄國，比英法德都落後。然而今天，自一九一七年以後，竟成爲全世界的新文化—社會主義文化的先驅。後進國在文化上有貢獻，簡直成了一個法則。</p>
<p>爲甚麼呢？理由只有一個，卽從歷史發展的尖端出發。明白說，即從先進國所暗示出的發展方向出發。換成大家所週知的話，就是「迎頭趕上去」。譬如工業的動力機關，如果先進國巳經由水而汽而電，那末你就一直從電起向前走去。這可以有創造的餘地。若從水起，那叫做隨後跟着走，永遠都只能模倣，不能創造。</p>
<p>這樣，在文化方面而欲有創造作用，便必須從社會主義出發。因爲它在西洋是方與的東西，急待人去發揮其創造力。俄國就是因此而走到世界文化史前面去了的。若我們的介紹，從資本主義起，而且只滿足於資本主義，那就絕沒有創造可言。因爲資本主義在西洋經過了三百年，到現在，它己由萌芽而發展而衰老，沒有創造的餘地。介紹這種文化，顯然是走下降的路。</p>
<p>胡適，陳序經，梁實秋等所介紹的，表面叫西洋文化，其實卽資本主義文化—帝國主義文化。他們隨後跟着走，一輩子都只是步人家的後塵，當然感覺不到創造。所以胡適公然主張模倣，並且說模倣就是創造（「獨立評論」第一三號）。陳序經的全盤西化，卽是全槃模倣。梁實秋則詆創迭爲誇大狂。</p>
<p>這樣的模倣，是文化的投降。中國民族啊，倒在帝國主義懷裏去吧。它如果要把你變成經濟的殖民地，政治的殖民地，那末你就應該進一步變成文化的殖民地！</p>
<p>我們反對帝國主義的人不然。我們要求經濟的獨立自出，要求政治的獨立自由，更要求文化的獨立自由。如果說前兩個要求是一種實踐的行爲，後一個要求是一種意識的活動，而人的行爲又必須通過意識，那末文化的獨立目由之要求，是解除經濟壓迫和政治壓迫即整個壓迫的開始。它表示中國民族的覺醒。</p>
<p>在八九十年的壓迫之後，尤其在「九一八」，「一二八」，「河北問題」之後，主張文化的獨立自由，是智識份千之精神的抗議。不，還是中國民族在新的壓迫後不甘屈服而要求整僩的獨立自由之新的開始。</p>
<p>打倒文化界的洋奴買辦！</p>
<p>從歷史發展的尖端創造新文化！</p>
<h3 id="c216">「一八四八年的德國」 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 李建芳</p>
<p>新生命出版　價六角</p>
<p>—讀史筆記之一—</p>
<p>「一八四八年的德國」，又名『革命與反革命」。這書在過去一般人都以爲是馬克思作的，但自馬克思與恩格斯通信集發表後，人們才知道這本書乃出自恩裕斯之手。這是一本研究一八四八年德國革命的名著。本書的編者愛麓娜馬克思（馬氏的女兒）說這本書與馬克思所寫「路易邦拿巴特布魯麥月之十八日』堪稱雙絕，是一點也不錯的。</p>
<p>這本書筆者在好久以前巳經讀過一次，這次因爲筆者欲把十七八世紀和十九世紀初顯的德國歷史與中國近百年歷史作一比較研究，又詳細的把本書讀了一次。在筆者這次讀完本書之後，筆者不僅感到近百年來的中國史與一五二三—一八四八年的德國史有極多的近似，而且筆者還發現一八四八年的德國革命與一九一一年的中國革命也有許多相似處。</p>
<p>一八四八年前德國是一個封建小邦林立的國家，一九一一年前的中國也是如此。一八四八年前德國是被法俄所宰制的國家，一九一一年前的中國也是如此。一八四八年德國的封建諸侯的力量高出當時的德國的中產階級，一九一一一年的中國也是如此。</p>
<p>一八四八年革命是失敗了。失敗的原因，自一然是因爲地方諸侯反對民族主義和德國的中產階級之軟弱無能所致。因此，一八四八年革命不但未達到使德統一，反而導出莫大的分裂。此種分裂之最明顯的表示，便是同種同文的奧地利完全分離德意志而獨立。這是一八四八年的結果，這結果很類似我們的一九一一年革命。不過德國當時比中國好的，一方面，是一八四八年時德國資本主義發展似乎比中國爲高，他方面，德國在一八四八年沒有中國在一九一一年那樣多的剩餘人口。因此，一八四八年革命　只導出奧地利的獨立，還沒有導出中國式的軍閥內戰。不過據恩格斯說，這槺可能，當時是充分的所存着。</p>
<p>至於中國，它因土地面積廣大，資本主義發展又弱，加以廣大的剩餘人口之存在和地方軍團對中央離心力之形成，所以一九一一年革命直接成為軍閥戰爭的信號。自然，一九一一年革命後的內戰，有許多是因布國主義想在中國爭奪勢力範圍造成的，但假如中國沒有給帝國主義利用的基礎，即使有帝國主義也仍不能發生內戰。</p>
<p>中國過去十數年的內戰是在滿消帝國與洪揚作鬥爭中安下基礎的。滿淸帝國爲了與洪揚作鬥爭，他不能不允許各地地主自由練兵，並且爲了挽救中央財政之不足，可不得不允許各地地主自由設立厘金關卡。此種情形與一五二三年德國農民暴動後的情形正同。德國的農民戰爭是德國歷史退潮之開始，中國的洪揚暴動也是中國的歷史退廟之開始。德國的農民暴動直接導出德國的地方諸侯反中央集權之爭，導出一六八一—一六四八年的三十年戰爭，中國洪揚暴動之結果導出近十數年的軍閥內戰。德國三十年戰爭之結果，照恩格斯說，是使德國在二百年中完全退出了歐洲諸民族政治活動的歷史舞臺。中國的農民戰爭所導出的社會後果也使中國在近六七十年來不能翻身興起。</p>
<p>當一八四八年時，德國的統一，照恩格斯說有三條道路：</p>
<p>第一條是推翻一切林立的國家，實現眞正的統一，即公開的革命的道路。</p>
<p>第二條是在奧地利領導下的統一。</p>
<p>第三條是在普魯斯領導下的統一。</p>
<p>如我們所知，第一條路和第二條路都失敗了，後來德國是實現了第三條路。</p>
<p>這第三條路是怎樣實現的？大家都知道，這是俾士麥鐵血政策之結果。一八四八年革命雖然失敗了，但德國資本主義並不因而停止。反之，由一八四八至一八六三年德國資本主義比中國一九一一年後的資本主義發展更快。因爲這種發展的結果，才使俾士麥獲得中產階級的援助出來統一德國。俾士麥在一八六四年和一九六六年所進行的兩次對因統一的戰爭是帶有革命意義的。這戰爭比之一九二五—二七年中國的北伐並無根本不同之處，相反，他們的歷失意義倒是很相同的。</p>
<p>俾士麥的勝利，本是象徵德意志的重新獲得國家統一。雖然這統一是上層階級來完成的，但這對於德意志民族發展有非常重大的意義。一八六六年，當俾士麥對奧地利已確然取得勝利之後，德國現在最大的敵人當是法國。法國這個時候妨碍德國的統一恰像現在的日本妨碍中國統一樣。</p>
<p>法國當時是拿破侖第二執政時代，他的政策在盡力使德國繼續分裂。他要德國仍保留許多小邦統治的局面以便他居間操縱。於是，德國的統一必然要迫使德國去與法國戰爭。一八七〇年普法戰爭果然爆發了。結果普魯士戰勝了法蘭西，於是統一的德意志帝國完全成立。</p>
<p>從德國的歷史研究中，我們可不可以對中國目前的局面作出某種診斷呢？這是我覺得最堪我們的注意的。</p>

<p>十六亞東書局</p>
<p>以考證及標點舊，小說而起家的亞東書局，在過去幾年中委實發了一點財。亞東的成功（自然祗指發財一點）實屬僥倖。因爲，新靑年時代以後，胡適之正在「走紅」，幾本胡適文存是歸亞東出的。同時，舊的白話小說因白話文運動而更受一般的重視，何况又加上自話運動的「發起人」（？）胡博士的考證標點，自必更爲紙貴洛陽（這種舊小說，在當時有許多，較頑固的中小學中，學生是祇能偷看的，自從胡博士提倡後，很多被採作課外讀物或補充讀本）。而這些書又都是亞東書局出版的，因魯迅一人的成功，而產生了現在的「北新」，何况當時的胡博士，亞東那有不發財之理？</p>
<p>每家範圍較小的書局，因主持者或編輯部負責人的主觀决定，在出版方面往往會無形中形成一個系統，或特性。然亞東除標點舊小說外，這種系統或特性是沒有的。亞東的新書不算少，也有數十種，而其中，有的是辯證法一類的社會科學方面專著，有的是莫明其妙的「星期X」派的文學，祗要去翻一下亞東的圓書目錄，即可知道該局編輯部的無能，或是主持者根本是對出版無理解的書買。</p>
<p>不久，粗製濫造的新文化書社等標點書，競賣於前，一折八扣七扣的標點書潮湧於後，一個在出版上沒有方針的書局自必無所措手了。</p>
<p>十七　女子書店</p>
<p>上海的書店照例是聚集在福州路棋盤街一帶，但是也有例外，女子書店便是開設在霞飛路許多鱗次櫛比的按摩院中間的。這是女子書店給與我們讀者一個最深的印象。次之，則要算是「女子書店」這個名稱，但是亦祇此名稱而止，如其所出版的『女子文庫」「女子月刋』等等，則與從前商務的「婦女雜誌」開明的「新女性」等，似相去遠甚。然而如『婦女雜誌」「新女性」等，不僅編輯撰著者多是男子，且其閱讀的分子，亦多爲男子，故以女子知識程度之落後，「女子月刋」正足表示其爲女子的讀物。而如現今時露頸角於報紙廣告上的『女聲』，也正如此，與「女子月刋』堪稱爲一對姊妹花。可是最近自「女子月刋」「女子文庫」的編輯者黃心勉女士以病去世，女子書店的主持者，巳不是女子，而爲男子姚名達先生，以後的女子書店及其所出版的書籍，或者會有相當的改革罷。</p>
<p>十八　新中國書店</p>
<p>「新中國一歷史不久，現巳在沉默中了。新中國在過去並不曾給予我們多少可注意的地方，但自開明遷移新址，新中國移入開明舊址的時候，可也曾稍稍引起大家的注意，而那知自成立門市部以後，新中國反而日趨沉默下來了。</p>
<p>新中國出版的書籍，第一是文藝叢書，接着是兒童讀物，此外就少見新書出版，這二種書都是很「適應潮流」的，因爲這時候別家書局正在出這一類的書。就因其如此，新中國不得不沉默下來，因爲，先入好主，新中國的文藝書與兒童讀物是落了人家的後面，而其本身又少有特色，可以搶上前去。對於這樣的書店，是很可惋惜的，因爲於「營利」及「推動文化」上雨者均無所獲。</p>

<h3 id="c218">旱災的救濟與防範 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>苦命的中國農民，近幾年來，每年都得在天災人禍的荼毒下過生活。本年自入夏以後，各地旱象巳成，或雨水缺乏，或河渠乾涸。及至近日，各省之呈報災象者，又紛至沓來。計豫省河涸沙揚，蘇省風雹爲災，陝省黑霜屢降，皖省水災冰雹災，閩省水災，察省大風雨災。由此看來，各地旱象災象，不但沒有减輕，且有越趨險惡的傾向。一般農民，又陷於水深火烈之中。若不早圖救濟防範，今後農村，定必將由衰敗而走入潰滅之路。國民經濟的前途，實有令人不堪設想者。</p>
<p>救濟之策，自然只有希望政府當局和社會各慈善機關，合力進行。對各省災區，施賑糧食。俾無數災民，不至有吃樹皮草根之苦，或餓以待斃。願全國熱心同胞，以惻隱爲懷，各盡自己的能力，慷慨解囊，以拯救一輩無辜的災民。語云，居安思危。農村一破產，都市的崩頹，亦必隨之。大家切勿視各地災民的號天搶地爲無關痛癢，而不加以援助也。</p>
<p>至若防範，這工作亦十分急切。旱象雖然是一種天災，雖以阻止。但西人有言，人力可以勝天。我們若能對各旱象已著的地方，設法疏浚河渠，以爲未雨的綢繆，未始不能補救於萬一。否則一任旱象的襲擊，日後秋收無望，許多貧苦的農民，生活就更一無保障。</p>
<p>此外，農村旱災一成，米業奸商，便要趁火打刦。或囤積居奇，或高抬穀價。其影響於一般民食，爲害甚巨。故對於這一情形，希望當局亦能加以深切的注意，嚴厲禁止奸商的操縱糧食，以解民困。</p>
<h3 id="c219">寄居 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 摩加</p>
<p>爲着一種意外事的襲來，忽忽地捨開了家，就在當天的下午跑到鄕間的這里來住了。</p>
<p>許是由於回想往事而在闊別的心情中無形增加不少的親熱惑吧。第一天到着的時候，彼此見了面，主人出乎我意料之外地用着極其濃烈的情感和懇摯的態度招呼着，這使我感到很大的慰安，——暫時有了一個寄身的地方。挨近黃昏，沒等我說出，主人已經會意似的爲我整頓一席牀位。</p>
<p>—說不定還要多住幾天哩，我加以聲明着。</p>
<p>—沒有關係的，儘你住着吧，主人很誠心地答。</p>
<p>晚上，熄了燈，各睡在被窩裏，還不停地絮談着隔離着的幾年間不同的遭逢，以及回味着中學時各種有趣的而又呌人懷戀的記憶，到了感得話已說完有點困倦方迷矇睡去。</p>
<p>便那麼草草地住了下來了。</p>
<p>在自己闖地碰着不幸的際遇，又正是窮倒得很可以的當兒，能獲到一個有得吃有得睏的處所，可是第一宗呌我領受不了的是每天要很早便爬上來，夜間很早就寢，——主人還依然保存着學生時代的生活習慣，而要使我這個已久沉‘在都會裏有着都會人所有的性格，一下子變改過來，實在會感到很大的痛苦。我雖想竭力做到，終於轉移不來，照樣還是每天起得遲，也睡得遲。起初主人似乎是爲了自己初來的緣故，沒有作任何的表示，過不了數天，他可用着很正經的面孔向我說着了：</p>
<p>——這樣的生話，不是太頹唐了麼？你爲什麼變了這樣。他臉上同時浮現着以爲自己並不頹唐的近於傲驕的微笑</p>
<p>——養成一種習慣了，自從寫文章以來數年間的生活都是如此的，明知頹唐，亦沒辦法。</p>
<p>我祇好讓步來附合他的，話腔，對於他那樣單純的見解心屏却覺得有點可笑。</p>
<p>於是很容易得意的主人又得意的笑着。</p>
<p>容易得意同時容易冐火正是主人一向的脾氣，從在中學同學時我便淸楚他追性子，到此刻仍沒一點遷移，在言動之間，他總是喜歡流露一種自恃聰明和知逝的事比別人來得多的誇示，每每跟家人談論一個問題，往往是尤是隨使的談笑，結果常是弄成刻骨的相詆惡意的吵嘴，以至都靑着臉悻悻地散開。因此，　我們談　中國無論怎樣不致衝突或賭氣，爲了每次我　讓他佔着全　的　利。</p>
<p>我曉得住在別人的家，光吃光睡，在任何一點上，都需要儘量抹殺自己，看輕自己，甚至於湮沒自己一切的個性思想，以遷就主人所有的一切而賺來好感與親暱，就是爲此，我的精神上增加一重爲環境所姦迫的苦楚了。</p>
<p>爲什麼要這樣，就爲了是住在別人的家。</p>
<p>很快地過了一個月了，明天我卽將離開此去，雖然要擔憂着活計，但載在精神上不自由的鐐架的痛苦却比擔憂爲活計的痛苦更甚，而最後我還得含着一口感激和主人吿別；這些日子虧得厚待，煩擾你够了，謝謝。</p>
<p>好在明天精神上的鐐架，可以解除了。</p>
<h3 id="c220">鄉居的故事 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 凌頴</p>
<p>南窗底下是新居的院子，兩列低矮的冬靑樹夾着一道砌着人字磚的花徑。近石壇是四株梧桐樹，是去春新栽的，因爲花匠底善意培植，軀幹已高出樓窗了，從頂上撤下來如傘一般的大粟，在窗前輕盈地起舞。我想着屋主人的曲意修飾，現在却以最低的租價由我來享受了。</p>
<p>去年從醫院中出來，醫生勸吿我住到鄉下去、但是爲了職業關係。我始終不能離開都市；然而鄉居的决心那時候在心中定了基礎。此次無意中覓得了這近郊的住宅、很順利地搬來了。</p>
<p>屋主人是位五十左右的老婦人，當妻初次訪見的時候，她就那樣坦白地叨嘮了半天。她吿訴妻她的兒子交易所失敗後失蹤了。她的財產盡數償還了兒子的債務，只留得這所近鄉的宅子同八歲的孫兒及一個老僕人住在這裏，她更慚愧地說，鄕下是太寂寞了，同時想增加一點進欵帮助家用，由老僕人的主意登了個廣告，招一份正式的同居。</p>
<p>第二天我們就雙方合意了搬進去。屋子是一排三間，兩進，我們租的是前進，如果在都市要租同樣的房屋，恐怕在三四倍租價以上吧。</p>
<p>我們把中間一間留做自己的臥房、左側是孩子和奶媽住的，右面同意了妻子的意見佈置一間客房，她說雖然一小時公共汽車到抵上海，但是朋友親戚們來來去去倒底是不便的，住在鄉下地方沒有留客人住夜的舖位彷彿沒有這規矩似的。</p>
<p>樓下中間客堂公用，右面一間我做了書房、渴慕着有一間淸靜的書室，讓自己關在里面讀一點書、這願望到現在是實現了，當搬來的時候，主人驚異我有那末多的行李，其實大部份就是我的　楚了書進。那位老家　問我是做一先生」的嗎，或許亦是這理由。</p>
<p>左手一間自然是會客室了。幸而主人借給我們許多傢具，否則從住於斯食於斯衣於斯的一間住屋中搬來，現在要分配五間屋子，是一個出色的笑話了。</p>
<p>當天晚上，我們稍稍佈置完畢，主人携了她的孫走來，說過幾句普通話，她又重述了昨天的故事。上年紀的人本來喜歡多說多話的，現在好像有了個對手，她幾乎獨自搬講着她家的歷來，最後她竟是鳴咽地哭了。這使我感到一點不滿意，如果她一有機會就演述她兒子做交易所的故事，眞是太爲難人了。她是受了重大的刺激，那樣地搬講着彷彿能解除一點痛苦的。然而這痛苦將轉移到他人身上，說句笑話、對於我養病的宗旨也是不相宜的。</p>
<p>妻卻聽出了神，她說了許多勸婉的話，簡直像母親撫慰一個被人家打哭了回來的孩子。我雖然始終對於這故事沒有挿一句類於感歎的話、靠着窗。呆望着皎潔約明月從雲層中遊移，院子中就像舖着一片碎錦、幻想主人的兒子是個善於經營的大商人，靈活的手腕、善於思維的頭腦，身材是寬大的，有一個胖胖的面盤；或許留着一叢小鬚子，那樣一個人做交易所失敗了遺下年高的母親叨嘮着這難於磨滅的歷史；而透所別</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>墅被那樣平凡一個人來享受了，眼前彷彿浮出一個自殺的慘像，那個老年人却還希望着她兒子歸來呢！</p>
<p>臨走時她對妻說，我兒子是大學畢業的，他如果回來了一定和凌先生很談得來的。</p>
<p>我望着她背影，下樓去，心中忙然不釋，從藥瓶傾出兩片安眠藥，我恐怕今晚要失眠。</p>
<h3 id="c221">孤獨者 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>夜了，四下里都是靜寂的。</p>
<p>這房子，一定是五六年前的建造，不是麽？牆壁，那樣黑，原有的白淨早已不知去向，並且，星星點點的。遠處看上去，也許要有人以爲那是花紋，其實，那正是應時產生的小動物的殘骸呵</p>
<p>天氣，在交到了陽光近於赤道的時季，白天，地面上流着油，這籠子似的房屋，有着蒸鍋樣的悶熱，住在里面的人，要直覺能到窒息住人的呼吸的悶鬱</p>
<p>但，悶鬱的時間畢竟不是很長久的，當向晚的涼風習習地吹送當兒，這一埭見方的屋子並不因大小的關繫而失去了牠的惠賜，可是，不管住的地方是怎樣的不值錢，但，生命畢竟還是值得寶貴的，於此，爲了顧全可貴的生命，臨睡的時候，必須要把那窗子關了起來的</p>
<p>不知怎麽，疲勞噬吞了的心靈，想要躺在床上立時的入睡幾乎是不可能的，想着日間的事物，想着尊傲的面孔，也想着明日將怎樣的去工作，這樣，心靈便會格外的不安的。</p>
<p>推開僅有的一面窗子，高的空鳥黑一片，不見作着媚眼的星，也不見銀樣的目，田下都是次次地，像含蓄着雨意。</p>
<p>輕風里，帶來了一陣哭聲，怪尖利的！</p>
<p>—饒了我吧，哎，天……悲切的，像一個孩童被毒打。</p>
<p>禁不住的，疲憊的必情振奮了一下，伏在窗口上，多靜，沒有一點雜亂的音響，淸冷的空氣吹着，在這里，也在那里。</p>
<p>大概是毒打下應有的反應吧？逐漸的，聲音是擴大了，自然悲切的成分也分外的濃厚，挺熟，我意識到又是對面的那個女人在對買來的阿榮試行刑事的處罰。</p>
<p>這樣，彷彿有一種力緊怪着，聽着，一陣迎面的冷風打了過來，合上眼睛，無數的火星在臉前閃着，跳着。</p>
<p>忽然的，火星往兩邊分開，顯出一個不勻稱的面龐，倭小的身子，破敗的衣褲，枯黃削瘦的肌膚，悸動腫脹的眼鼻，和驚懼交集的情態。</p>
<p>施與當然不會就此交結的，相反的，由淸脆的傳遞中，很明顯的那是更重了。可是，不知怎麽，哭悲切，都聽不見了，聽見的是，快速率的詬罵知叱責。</p>
<p>遠處的燈，被樹葉的搖蕩一明一滅的。</p>
<p>當夕陽再次的躥進了我的屋子，拖了笨重的脚走進了弄堂，但，阿榮的踪影呢？不見了，進了屋子，頭昏昏地，一股難以抗禦的熱力猛撲着，我想，她也許受了重傷，也許臥倒在床，也許……不同的壞念盤旋着。</p>
<p>夜里，照舊的關上窗子，照舊的在床上翻覆着，突然的，一個枯瘦的女孩子，赤裸了上身，佈滿了一條一條的血痕，眼眶里，蘊含着欲奪的淚水，口層不住的抽咽，臉上，掛上了悽慘的形態。</p>
<p>最後，她哭了，嘴角瑟動着，顫抖的驚懼着，像要想說什麽是的。</p>
<p>心情紊亂的不能安閒的睡下去，再推開窗子，雨絲淸脆的擊奏着，遠處的燈，被樹葉的蕩動一明一滅的，四下里，都是沉寂。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Investigation Matters to be Discussed in Beiping, Japanese Embassy Holds Important Meeting, Doihara Denies Making Demands, Song Zheyuan Temporarily Recuperates in Tianjin, Qin Dechun Departs from Zhangjiakou for Beiping <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Doihara arrived in Beiping last night, Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, also arrived in Beiping. Doihara and other important Japanese figures held an important meeting in the military attaché's office of the Japanese embassy this morning. It is reported that Matsui will leave Beiping for Chahar within two or three days to negotiate with the Chahar provincial authorities. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan arrived in Beiping yesterday morning, he went to Tianjin in the afternoon. He told people that he would recuperate in Tianjin in the near future. There are rumors that he will go to Nanjing and Sichuan, but he has no such plans at present. Qin Dechun sent a long telegram to Song this morning, which was sent from Zhangjiakou to Beiping. The Beiping office of the 29th Army informed Song by telephone that Qin had many matters to attend to at the provincial government and would not come to Beiping for three to five days. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Takahashi told reporters that after Doihara and Matsui arrived in Beiping, they met at the embassy yesterday and planned to stay in Beiping for a few days before returning to Tianjin. Although the Zhangbei incident has largely come to an end, a complete resolution still requires waiting for the right opportunity. The negotiation location is planned to be in Beiping for convenient contact. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Katsushima, an official of the Zhangjiakou Special Service Agency, left Beiping for Zhangjiakou this afternoon on Matsui's orders, carrying ten pieces of military supplies. Negotiations on the Zhangbei incident still require waiting for a few days. Before starting talks, it is reported that several matters still need to be investigated. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsui, the military liaison officer of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Chahar, will go to Zhangjiakou to meet Qin Dechun after meeting Wang Kemin and Doihara to discuss unresolved Chahar matters.

When reporters asked about the conditions Japan needed to resolve the case, Doihara only replied that he hoped to avoid any misunderstandings. He also said that he was quite satisfied with the steps taken by the Chinese authorities in Hebei to meet Japan's demands, and he believed that this matter had now been concluded and that relations between the two countries would improve. He came to Beiping to resolve the Chahar dispute and had not made any demands. Any actions taken by China in Chahar were not at Japan's request. He hoped to meet with the Chahar authorities soon, and the Chahar case would be resolved quickly at that time. There are currently fewer than 20,000 Japanese soldiers near the Great Wall.

<h3 id="e6">Legislative Yuan Passes General Budget Bill, Bankruptcy Law Also Passed Simultaneously, Ma Yinchu Reports on Review of Budget Bill, Fu Bingchang Reports on Drafting of Bankruptcy Law <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 22nd meeting on the morning of the 21st. Sixty-nine members, including Fu Bingchang, were present. Sun Ke was the chairman, and Liang Hancao was the secretary-general. The following matters were discussed: (1) The National General Budget Bill for Fiscal Year 1935 was resolved to be passed in accordance with the results of the review by the five committees on finance, law, diplomacy, economy, and military affairs. (2) The five committees on finance, law, diplomacy, economy, and military affairs reported on the draft Regulations for the Implementation of the National General Budget Bill for Fiscal Year 1935, which was resolved to be amended and passed. (3) The Civil Law Committee reported on the draft Bankruptcy Law, and the first chapter, General Provisions, and the second chapter, Reconciliation, totaling 56 articles, were amended and passed during the second reading. The remaining articles will be discussed further at 2:30 PM. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued its discussion on the Bankruptcy Law at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 21st. During the second reading, the third chapter, Reconciliation, and the fourth chapter, Penal Provisions, totaling 63 articles, were amended and passed. The entire bill was passed during the third reading, which was omitted. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. Before the Bankruptcy Law was discussed, Fu Bingchang reported on the drafting process, stating that during the late Qing Dynasty, Wu Tingfang and others had drafted a bankruptcy law, and after the Republic of China, the Ministry of Justice in Beijing also had provisions for a bankruptcy law, which were informally used by courts at all levels. Its content was almost identical to the old Japanese bankruptcy law. The Ministry of Justice of the National Government also drafted a bankruptcy law, the content of which was mostly based on the old draft. Last year, the Ministry of Judicial Administration also submitted to the National Government and promulgated the Regulations for Clearing Merchants' Debts, which was used as an interim measure before the promulgation of the bankruptcy law. Currently, various parties are urging the Legislative Yuan to enact a bankruptcy law. The initial draft was completed in April of this year and publicly solicited opinions. Later, the consultant Bao Dao also obtained various opinions from foreign legal experts and chambers of commerce in China, and consultants Escarra and Stanton Shirley also sent letters from Paris and Hong Kong respectively, stating their observations and criticisms. After careful consideration of various opinions by the Civil Law Committee, and after inviting the consultant Bao Dao to participate in the discussion, the initial draft was revised, and the Bankruptcy Law draft was completed, consisting of 159 articles. The chapter system does not distinguish between substantive and procedural law, and the content adopts old Chinese customs. A reconciliation procedure is applied before bankruptcy to conform to national conditions, and penalties are stipulated for those who fraudulently transfer assets to protect the interests of creditors. He took about an hour to finish his speech, and then began the discussion. Although various members raised objections to the title of the Bankruptcy Law, the chamber of commerce reconciliation in the reconciliation procedure, and the exemption of remaining debts, the drafters of the Civil Law Committee responded in various ways, and the opposition was overcome. Except for minor modifications to the wording of the entire bill, the chapter order and number of articles remained the same. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the Legislative Yuan's general meeting on the 21st to review the general budget bill, Ma Yinchu reported that after the five committees were instructed by the President of the Yuan to review the bill, they held two meetings and discussed it in detail. After discussion, it was decided to pass the general budget according to the original bill. As for the central government's instructions to abolish the Anti-Opium Association and establish the Anti-Opium General Supervision Office, and to follow the precedent of the 20th year of the Republic of China by allocating 2 million yuan from the second reserve fund as a disaster relief reserve, they should be followed. However, since the general budget has been passed according to the bill, it should be reported to the National Government and directly submitted to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for verification and supplementary compilation, and then promulgated and implemented. The progress in the compilation of this year's general budget includes: (1) At the beginning of the establishment of the preliminary budget, the central government specially established a budget planning committee, sparing no effort to consult widely and engage in planned compilation to rationalize revenue and expenditure. (2) In previous years, the general budget was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review only at the end of the fiscal year, or after more than half of it had passed. This year, it was sent to the Legislative Yuan before the fiscal year began. The shortcomings include: (1) This year's general business budget was not submitted to the Yuan with the bill. (2) The time the bill arrived at the Yuan was still not in accordance with the date stipulated in the Budget Law, resulting in a very short review time for the Yuan. This shortcoming was due to the slightly delayed submission of the second-level preliminary budget to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, not because the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics delayed it. It is hoped that it can be improved in the next year. The committee then reviewed the seven articles of the Implementation Regulations for this year's General Budget drafted by various committees and submitted them to the Yuan meeting for review. The provisions of these regulations, such as the actual situation of various issued public bonds during the budget year, should be compiled and reported by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Audit, and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics every three months and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for record and public announcement of methods to reduce the salt tax rate, and expenses not included in this budget may not be paid without additional budget procedures, are all to ensure the integrity of the budget system, prevent speculation in public bond transactions, and promote the reduction of the people's burden. After Ma's report, the chairman took a vote, and the entire room unanimously passed the bill without objection. The Yuan then reviewed the Regulations for the Implementation of the General Budget. The chairman asked the drafters to explain the provision in the regulations that treasury bills exceeding a fiscal year would no longer be issued during this budget year. Chen Changheng and Ma Yinchu stood up successively and replied that the nature of treasury bills and public bonds had not been clearly distinguished in the past. Treasury bills are repaid with principal and interest every month, with a maximum of one year, and do not increase the people's burden. Their issuance does not require legislative procedures. Public bonds are repaid with principal and interest in two installments every year, and the time is longer, so legislative procedures must be followed. In the past, in order to avoid sending the issuance of public bonds through legislative procedures, the issuing agency issued public bonds in the name of treasury bills. The restriction added to this bill is to prevent this kind of malpractice from happening again. Later, according to the chairman's proposal, the original Article 6, "The National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget and the Operating Budget of various State-owned Enterprises for the next fiscal year shall be compiled separately in accordance with the Budget Law," was deleted, and the legislative intent of the article was incorporated into the Review Report of the General Budget Bill. The rest was only a modification of the wording. The original text of the Regulations for the Implementation of the National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget for the 24th Year of the Republic of China after amendment and passage is as follows: Article 1 The implementation of the National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget for this year shall be in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, except for the implementation notes approved by the Central Political Council. Article 2 Treasury bills exceeding this fiscal year shall not be issued during this budget year. Article 3 The actual situation of various public bonds issued during this budget year shall be compiled and reported every three months by the Ministry of Finance, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the Ministry of Audit, and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for record and public announcement. Article 4 The competent administrative agency shall take measures to reduce the salt tax rate during this budget year. Article 5 Expenses not included in this budget may not be paid without additional budget procedures. Article 6 These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

<p>(Hong Kong) The Haiqi and Haichen warships left Hong Kong for the north at 4:30 PM on the 21st. The Central Tongji warship arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 21st, but it was not related to the two warships' return north. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The two warships forced Chen Hao, the captain of the Haichen warship, to go north in order to demand that Guangdong release Jiang Xiyuan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the two warships left the port, they turned back to Hong Kong for some reason when they were 10 miles from the Waglan Island Lighthouse. They arrived at 8:00 PM and anchored in Kowloon Bay, awaiting resolution. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The reason for the two warships' return to Hong Kong on the evening of the 21st is said to be that they encountered a Guangdong warship and dozens of aircraft dropping bombs at the Waglan Island Lighthouse, so they retreated to await verification. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Haiqi and Haichen warships replenished coal and food in Hong Kong on the 20th and set sail north at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 21st. The Tongji warship arrived in Hong Kong from Xiamen on the morning of the 21st, carrying more than 100 naval students to sea for training. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Haiqi and Haichen warships weighed anchor and departed for Shanghai at 4:30 PM this afternoon, but when they reached the opposite side of the Waglan Island Lighthouse outside Hong Kong, a strange cruiser suddenly appeared and fired at the Haiqi and Haichen warships from a distance of several miles. The two warships were clearly unprepared for battle and did not fire back, but immediately turned back to Hong Kong, turned off their lights, and anchored in Kowloon Bay tonight. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Before the Haiqi warship departed today, its captain told guests that when the Tongji gunboat arrived here from Xiamen this morning, he immediately sent a representative to board the ship to inquire whether its arrival was related to Nanjing's plan to deal with the two warships. The reply was that the Tongji's arrival in Hong Kong was only for training cruises and had not received any instructions from Nanjing regarding the two warships. It is rumored that the coal purchased for the two warships' northward journey was guaranteed by Nanjing, but it has been verified today that this statement is not true and was purchased with the two warships' own funds. This proves that Nanjing has not officially accepted the suggestion that the two warships surrender. The Tongji gunboat is still anchored here at the naval pontoon. The two warships had prepared for Guangdong aircraft to attack them en route during this northward journey, but they never expected to be bombarded by warships. After this incident occurred, the British authorities have been on alert for further possible developments and have recalled all submariners and destroyers who had been granted shore leave tonight.

<p>(Chengdu) Recently, rumors about Guangdong and Guangxi have been rampant, and those who do not understand the truth inevitably make many speculations. According to a telegram sent by the Guizhou authorities to Chairman Chiang, relaying the telegrams received from Li Zongren on the 18th and Bai Chongxi and Huang Xuchu on the 16th, their attitude is sincere, which shows a glimpse of the real situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) Li's telegram: I went to Hong Kong to see Zhan Tang off as he went abroad for recuperation. I have been lingering for two weeks during my leisure from government affairs. I returned to Guangzhou last night and learned that rumors are rampant in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Guizhou, saying that Guangdong and Guangxi will take military action against the central government, which is deeply shocking. The foreign crisis is imminent, and it is time for the whole country to go to the national crisis together. Those who like to cause trouble intend to instigate and fabricate rumors. Recently, because the Guangdong army is preparing to return from Guizhou, outsiders do not understand, which leads to many speculations. A little investigation will reveal the truth. Please ask your brother to report to the Chairman. (2) Bai and Huang's telegram: Huang Guidan, the representative of Guizhou stationed in Guizhou, came to see me and showed me the telegram Bai Jiansheng and Huang Xuchu sent to him on the 16th, saying: Your telegram has been received. Rumors in Guizhou that there will be military action in the Southwest are the same as those circulating in Shanghai and Sichuan. The empty valley echoes, which is deeply shocking. Now that North China is tight and the foreign crisis is imminent, we are cooperating to resist the enemy, and we are afraid that we will not be able to win. How can we be so insane and cut ourselves off from our countrymen? I hope you will be responsible for explaining, and I also ask Guizhou Province to send someone to Guizhou to investigate, which will be clear without debate. The so-called facts speak louder than words. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Special Issue of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach in the 24th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<h3 id="e11">Inaugural Address <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai Xingye Trust Company</p>
<p>Shanghai is a bustling and prosperous port, but it lacks famous mountains that can be used for sightseeing. What meets the eye are bustling city streets and tall buildings, making it difficult to explore scenic spots. However, although Shanghai cannot be said to have mountains, it has the seaside of Gaoqiao in terms of water. In the scorching summer, when the oppressive heat assails people, one can only seek solace in this place.</p>
<p>Gaoqiao is located on the west bank of the Huangpu River and borders the sea to the east, giving it a unique advantage. The seaside terrain is flat, and the sandy beach is vast, making it a natural seawater bathing beach. In the past, one or two Westerners occasionally went to the seaside and discovered it. Later, as ferry transportation became more convenient and automobiles could travel directly, Chinese and Western ladies went together to visit, which was a great success for a time. However, in the past, it was contracted by merchants, and the houses were simple, the equipment was inadequate, and the food and drink could not meet people's needs. Tourists considered it a pity. This year, the city government took it back, and our company was entrusted with the matter. Therefore, we hired workers and prepared materials to carry out a major renovation. We spared no effort and did not dare to neglect anything. We carried out the construction quickly and aimed to complete it in two months. Now there is a dining hall that can accommodate 400 people, and the Chinese and Western delicacies are meticulously prepared. There is a pond where one can paddle, and a small boat can be enjoyed in the middle of the stream. The pebbles mixed in the sand were screened out, and the bumpy and difficult roads were leveled. Other facilities include showers for cleanliness, water level markers for safety, rental of tents and swimsuits for the convenience of tourists, and installation of Shanghai telephone lines for timely information. In short, we have considered everything for the convenience of tourists. In European and American countries, attracting tourists often focuses on convenient transportation and comfortable facilities. Our company is not talented, but we are willing to try a small test at the Gaoqiao seaside.</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao seaside is not only a tourist area, but also has fresh air for health. Seawater bathing can strengthen the body, and the temperature is not high, making it suitable for spending the summer. Furthermore, people in Shanghai often go to other places to escape the summer heat, but in fact, long summer trips can be tiring. Now, the Gaoqiao seaside has a lot of open space. Our company is planning a summer resort for the people of Shanghai and can help build simple villas, which is the most suitable for escaping the heat and maintaining health. It is very short from Shanghai, and it can be reached in a little over an hour. The water and sky are refreshing, and Chinese and Western ladies can lift their skirts and enjoy a clear trip.</p>
<p>Today is the opening of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach. It is our honor to have all of you gentlemen come to visit and give us your guidance. I dare to say a few words to express my gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Bird's-eye View of Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<h3 id="e13">Innovations and Features After Municipal Takeover <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tidying the Beach</p>
<p>The sand on the Gaoqiao seaside bathing beach was originally a kind of bright, clean, and fine sand, smooth and lovely. However, it was mixed with pebbles and uneven, lacking perfection. The first step this year is to remove the pebbles from the sand, sift it, and spread the fine sand evenly, then lay down yellow sand on top. Walking on it is like treading on a carpet, soft and smooth, exceptionally comfortable, and completely free of mud stains.</p>
<p>Safety Equipment</p>
<p>The slope of Gaoqiao Beach is extremely gentle. Within a li (approximately 1/3 mile) of the shore, the water depth is only waist-high, so even those unfamiliar with swimming are not in danger. This natural terrain is truly rare. However, in order to ensure safety, markers have been set up in deeper water areas. There are bell signals for both high and low tides, and flags are flown, so safety is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Showers and Washing</p>
<p>In the past, the biggest drawback of this bathing beach was the lack of fresh water for rinsing, causing visitors to feel uncomfortable with the salt water clinging to their bodies after swimming. This year, a huge sum has been specially allocated to build a state-of-the-art pool, water tower, and showers, fully tiled with white porcelain, and equipped with hot and cold fresh water faucets for visitors to shower. The cleanliness and hygiene are unparalleled.</p>
<p>Dining Facilities</p>
<p>In the past, the bathing beach only had a few thatched huts. After bathing, visitors had no comfortable place to rest or dine. This year, a large-scale dining hall has been built, capable of accommodating four hundred people. It is covered with verdant Spanish-style roof tiles and surrounded by steel windows, making it extremely bright and spacious. Looking out into the distance, the water and sky blend into one, offering a spectacular view. The interior equipment is completely different from that of ordinary restaurants. The dining hall at a bathing beach serves not only for dining but also for resting. Therefore, the chairs are all custom-made canvas chairs, ensuring that visitors feel comfortable in every way. The low prices are an added bonus.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Cuisine</p>
<p>All kinds of food and drink in the bathing beach dining hall are managed by the municipal ferry company itself.</p>
<p>A. Western food is completely French-style. The quality is carefully selected and abundant. The daily lunch and dinner menus are the same as those of the water-borne restaurant operated by the municipal ferry company.</p>
<p>B. All kinds of Western pastries, cold drinks, and fine wines are fully available.</p>
<p>C. Yangzhou-style dim sum, noodles, and dumplings are clean and delicious. Specially made soy sauce from Yangzhou and Zhenjiang vinegar are used. The ingredients and cooking methods have been carefully studied for a long time to suit summer tastes. Particular attention is paid to cleanliness and hygiene. The prices are even lower than those of ordinary restaurants in Shanghai, which is even more commendable.</p>
<p>Other Facilities</p>
<p>In the past, the bathing beach only had a few thatched huts, and the layout was simple and crude, not only failing to take advantage of the natural scenery but also hindering hygiene. This year, many men's and women's changing rooms have been built, neatly arranged and well-organized, with male and female staff performing their duties separately. The toilets are equipped with the latest sanitary facilities from 1935, and custom-made wool swimming suits are available for rent at reasonable prices. In addition, there are more than one hundred awnings for rent. There are also dozens of single and double bed summer rooms for guests to stay in. Water, electricity, and telephones are all available. Therefore, visitors with busy schedules can directly communicate with Pudong, the Special District, and other places at any time.</p>
<p>Bathing Beach Environment</p>
<p>The bathing beach faces the sea to the east, a superior natural location. In terms of artificial improvements, a lake and marsh have been specially created this year, with a lake-center pavilion built in the middle, bounded by a long embankment and connected by a wooden bridge. There is also a large shaded walkway, with more than 4,000 trees planted and more than 500 square meters of grass laid. There are also various potted plants and flowers, creating lush vegetation and a verdant carpet, reflecting the blue sea and sky, creating endless beauty. Even those who do not swim can stroll around to broaden their minds and soothe their spirits.</p>
<p>Air and Temperature</p>
<p>The freshness and clarity of the air on the seaside are well known and need not be described. The sea breeze in summer never ceases, contracting the skin pores and increasing the body's resistance. The temperature at the seaside is usually about ten degrees Fahrenheit lower than in Shanghai, making it ideal for summer heat relief.</p>
<p>Special Late-Night Return Shuttle Added</p>
<p>In the past, except on Saturdays and Sundays, the number of visitors to the bathing beach was not enthusiastic. Those who had jobs could only go after work and play for an hour before having to return to Shanghai, which was not enough time to fully enjoy themselves. Now that the number of municipal ferry boats has increased, from today onwards, regardless of wind or rain, a special late-night shuttle will depart from Gaoqiao at 10:00 PM every day, arriving at the Beijing Road pier at 11:00 PM. This will allow for several hours of enjoyment without affecting the next day's work. The proposed itinerary is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Depart from the Beijing Road pier on the municipal ferry at 5:00 PM every day.</p>
<p>(2) Arrive at the seaside bathing beach at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>(3) Swim, dine, and stroll.</p>
<p>(4) Take a special bus from the bathing beach at 9:40 PM to board a special ferry back to Shanghai, arriving at the Beijing Road pier at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Water Transportation</p>
<p>The municipal ferry company originally had five long-distance ferry boats (Nos. 1 to 5), with four boats running on the Shanghai-to-Wusong route and one boat as a spare. In recent years, especially on weekends and holidays, the number of people traveling to Gaoqiao, Wusong, and other places for swimming and bathing has been overwhelming. Even with the spare boat added to the schedule, it was still not enough. Furthermore, the demand for evening cooling trips, chartered ferries, and shuttle services for passengers by various shipping companies has been increasing daily. Therefore, a new boat, No. 6, was built in haste. The structure and size of this boat are similar to those of the No. 5 ferry, but the strength of the materials, horsepower, speed, and decoration are even superior to those of the No. 5 ferry. The front of the upper-class cabin is equipped with copper windows that can be opened or closed to adjust to the weather. It will join the Shanghai-Wusong line on July 1. It will also be used as an extra boat or for special trips when there are many tourists. Its speed is over twelve nautical miles per hour. It takes only forty minutes to travel from Gaoqiao to Shanghai. Therefore, water transportation will no longer be congested this year. The comfort and convenience for tourists will be incomparable to the past.</p>
<p>Land Transportation</p>
<p>Since the introduction of public buses from the Gaoqiao municipal ferry pier to the seaside bathing beach, passengers have found it much more convenient. However, there was still a feeling that there were not enough buses and that the roads were uneven. This year, regarding buses, in addition to thoroughly overhauling and repainting the original six public buses, four new buses have been added to meet the needs. Regarding roads, the Public Works Bureau has widened some of the narrower sections, and the bridges have also been reconstructed and widened. A road roller is used to constantly roll the road surface to ensure a smooth and fast ride without any bumps. Wooden fences have been added to the waiting area at the entrance of the bathing beach to allow passengers to board in order of ticket purchase, avoiding jostling and crowding. Therefore, land transportation has reached a state of perfection this year. Furthermore, in the past, this newspaper had no jurisdiction over the Tongren pier, where the order was chaotic, and there was no shelter from the sun while buying tickets and waiting for the boat. Since the completion of the double-deck floating pier on Beijing Road in January, all the previous inconveniences have been completely eliminated. Therefore, any tourist, regardless of the class of travel, can fully enjoy themselves from the moment they arrive at the Beijing Road pier until they return to the Beijing Road pier. While promoting physical fitness, the comfort of tourists is always taken into consideration. There may be many who are so happy that they forget to go home.</p>
<p>Summer Villas</p>
<p>There are thousands of acres of open space within the bathing beach area, and it is planned to build a number of temporary summer villas for Shanghai residents to spend the summer, saving them the trouble of traveling far away for summer vacation. For these summer villas, as long as you choose a location, this newspaper can build them on your behalf and rent them out under contract. The style and size can be determined by yourself. Water and electricity are readily available. Those interested in renting should contact the Shanghai Industrial and Trust Company at 66 Tianjin Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Within the seaside bathing beach, there is another lake and marsh. Boating and fishing are extremely enjoyable. A long embankment divides the lake into two, like the inner and outer lakes of West Lake. Proceeding from the lake-center pavilion, you will reach the assembly dining hall. Soft chairs are placed in the middle. After bathing, take a short break. The water and sky come to your senses, and hundreds of thoughts are washed away.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Travel Itinerary and Cost Estimate <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The journey to the seaside bathing beach involves taking the municipal ferry from the double-deck pier of the municipal ferry company on the Bund outside Beijing Road to Gaoqiao, then taking a public bus directly to the bathing beach. The estimated cost is as follows:</p>

<p>3. For the most economical journey, take the third-class cabin on the municipal ferry, costing 1 jiao 4 fen (14 fen) per person for the boat fare and 2 jiao (20 fen) for the bus fare, totaling only 6 jiao 8 fen (68 fen) for a round trip.</p>
<p>Round-trip boat and bus four-coupon tickets are available for purchase at the Beijing Road pier for all three options, making it extremely convenient. Anyone who purchases a boat and bus coupon ticket will also receive a free admission ticket to the seaside bathing beach.</p>
<p>4. Groups traveling together can send a letter to the municipal ferry management office (66 Tianjin Road) in advance to apply for a group ticket purchase permit. With the permit, they can purchase group tickets at the pier. The one-way fare is discounted by 30%, and the round-trip fare is discounted by 40%. However, this is limited to the ferry fare only; there are no group tickets for the public bus.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Effectiveness of Government Relief for Money Shops <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Cui</p>
<p>To relieve money shops, the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan in 24th-year financial public bonds on the 8th of this month as collateral for relief. This matter of mortgage lending has been fully completed. At a time of currency contraction, the circulation of this large amount of capital should gradually lead the financial industry to a smooth path.</p>
<p>The cause of today's financial turmoil is due to currency contraction, and currency contraction is caused by popular instability. The money shop industry has a long history and is deeply rooted in the industrial and commercial sectors. Its business policy is also biased toward credit lending to industrial and commercial enterprises. In recent years, due to the general economic downturn of industrial and commercial enterprises, the loaned funds could not be recovered on schedule, resulting in the failure to operate the funds smoothly. However, its content is actually quite stable. Therefore, at the request of the money shop representatives, the authorities decisively decided to allocate financial public bonds for relief. This is not only a measure to help money shops in distress, but also to benefit the general industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>According to investigations, among the total of 55 Shanghai clearing money shops, less than half have actually mortgaged for loans, and some have not borrowed the full amount or have signed but not borrowed. It can be seen that since the authorities' painstaking relief efforts, the emptiness of the people's hearts has been eliminated, and the supply and demand of finance has become increasingly stable.</p>
<p>The elimination of this money shop crisis is due, on the one hand, to the Ministry of Finance's allocation of funds for relief and the dispatch of personnel to supervise and manage the situation, seeking methods to treat the symptoms, and on the other hand, to the leaders of the banking and money industries working together to stabilize finance, and also striving to help each other turn around and coexist and prosper. This spirit of coordination is truly great and commendable. The instability of this year's financial situation is the only one since the 1911 Revolution. The degree of emptiness in the people's hearts even surpasses the situation of the 1911 Revolution. Without this spirit to remedy it, the crisis would inevitably deepen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the financial industry is based on all kinds of industrial and commercial enterprises. The prosperity or decline of industrial and commercial enterprises is the prosperity or decline of the financial industry. Conversely, only the financial industry with a sound organization can fully support industrial and commercial enterprises and lead them to prosperity. The recent efforts of the banking and money industries to provide small loans to industrial and commercial enterprises prove the truth of this statement. Recently, larger banks and money shops have taken consistent steps with the government. Now that the difficulties of the money shops have been eliminated, the long-dwindled industrial and commercial enterprises can be expected to recover at this time of improved circumstances.</p>

<p>(Paris) British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden arrived here at 3:05 PM tonight. It is expected that tomorrow he will discuss the European military and political situation with the French side, and explain the reasons for the UK's establishment of a naval agreement with Germany. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden's trip to Europe will also include a visit to Rome. According to official circles, Eden will discuss naval armament issues with French Prime Minister Laval, as well as the next steps to be taken regarding the conclusion of a Western European air pact. He will then go to Rome to discuss the same matters with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The British government made this announcement after Mussolini sent a letter agreeing to Eden's proposal to visit Rome. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to public announcements here, after visiting France, Eden will also proceed to Rome to meet with Mussolini to explain Britain's policy toward Germany. Although official reports only mention naval and air force issues, reliable sources suggest that Eden will also present new solutions to Italy regarding the Abyssinian issue. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Semi-official sources indicate that when British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden comes to Rome to hold talks with the Italian government, the Abyssinian issue will absolutely not be mentioned. As for the naval issue, Italy opposes all arms races and advocates convening an international conference to determine the tonnage limits of major naval powers. Otherwise, if countries regain the freedom to rearm, naval tonnage will inevitably continue to increase without end. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Anglo-French Talks Begin</p>
<p>(Paris) Anglo-French talks began at 11:30 AM this morning. In addition to British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, those representing Britain included British Ambassador to France Sir George Clerk and British Embassy Counselor Campbell. Those representing France included Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger and Director of Political Affairs Massigli. It is reported that this morning's talks were entirely limited to the Anglo-German naval agreement. After the talks, Laval hosted a luncheon. The talks will resume at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) After this morning's cabinet meeting, Sir Anthony Eden immediately met with Laval. This is given much importance here. Eden arrived in Paris at 7:00 PM last night and resided at the British Embassy. Newspapers this morning stated that this meeting is extremely important for international peace and the future of Franco-British relations. Wireless reports expressed optimism, saying that what is already clear is that the bond between Britain and France, after this open and honest negotiation, will become even stronger. This meeting is not limited to discussing the Anglo-German naval agreement, but will also involve the entire range of European armaments and security issues. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement, newspapers believe that unless Britain can propose a plan for closer cooperation with France on security issues to eliminate the impact of this separate agreement, Eden's trip may not be enough to appease French sentiment to a considerable degree. Moreover, since the naval issue has been separated from the overall security plan to form an agreement, newspapers are not keen on discussing a Western European air pact before the issues listed in the February 3rd London Declaration are resolved. The Petit Parisien reported: "The principles on which French foreign policy is based should not change. The various issues included in the February 3rd London Declaration cannot be partially resolved in a perfunctory manner. Therefore, if Eden only raises the issue of the air pact without mentioning others, the strong opposition of France and Italy is inevitable." The Echo de Paris reported: "Since the Anglo-German naval agreement was established on the 18th of this month, creating a new situation, we have had to make other plans, such as refusing to discuss the Western European air pact until the overall issue is resolved."

<h3 id="e37">Main Objectives of Eden's Visit to Italy <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) The government has proposed to Italy that Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden, after finishing his business in France, should go to Rome to hold talks with the Italian government, considering (1) the Abyssinian issue, (2) the naval issue, and (3) the Western European mutual assistance air pact. This proposal has been accepted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is generally understood that the British government, due to misunderstandings between Britain and Italy regarding the Abyssinian issue, first wants to eliminate them. After Eden arrives in Italy, he can take the opportunity to explain matters frankly to Mussolini to ensure a peaceful resolution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. British political figures are now planning to grant Italy significant economic interests in Abyssinia and build a railway between Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, passing through Abyssinian territory, to satisfy Italy's demands and avoid the outbreak of war. As for the naval issue, Eden will explain the content of the Anglo-German naval agreement to Mussolini. Since experts from both Britain and Germany have agreed on a seven-year period for the realization of the German naval plan, Italy and France may not immediately resume their freedom to build warships. Finally, Eden will explain the progress of negotiations on the Sky Locarno Pact and the Eastern European Pact, and jointly consider with Mussolini the Danube Pact, which is generally considered the most difficult to establish.

<h3 id="e38">Britain Actively Augmenting Air Force Strength, Adding 150 Aircraft, Increasing Fighter Speed <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British Air Force, having been approved by Parliament last month to expand the Aviation Department, is actively proceeding. According to the Daily Telegraph, the Aviation Department has already ordered several batches of aircraft, including two batches totaling 150 aircraft. The remaining batches are still under price negotiation. The aircraft to be built include several types of bombers, coastal reconnaissance aircraft, and training aircraft. Daytime bombers must have a range of 1,000 miles, while nighttime bombers must have a range of 2,000 miles. However, the speed of fighter planes will increase to between 275 and 300 miles per hour. It is expected that the capabilities of general aircraft will be developed, and civilian transport aircraft that can be transferred for military use will also have the same development.

<h3 id="e39">British First Lord of the Admiralty Explains Reasons for Anglo-German Agreement to the House of Commons; Acknowledges German Naval Reconstruction as a *fait accompli*; Fixed Ratio May Avoid Competition; Believes This Move Benefits the Conclusion of a General Agreement <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell today stated in the House of Commons the reasons why Britain had to conclude a naval agreement with Germany, stating that Britain, at the beginning of the talks, accepted Hitler's proposal that the ratio of British to German fleets should be fixed at 100 to 35. The British government believes that this is not only beneficial to future relations between the two countries but also facilitates the conclusion of a general agreement on the future limitation of naval armaments. The British government also considers this move to be very important, as it can permanently eliminate the possibility of Anglo-German naval competition. Once this competition begins, it will inevitably hinder the interests of British autonomous territories. The agreement is also indeed beneficial to the naval affairs of other countries. Some may say that the two countries should not have concluded this agreement, but we must face the facts. (Cheers from the audience) We must face the important practical problems. The fleet that Germany is currently building has exceeded the limits of the Treaty of Versailles. What we are doing now is to agree with Germany on a scope for the impact that Germany's unilateral decisions may have. We firmly believe that this move will ultimately benefit all naval countries in the world. If we had hesitated to accept Germany's proposal, we would have made a big mistake. Fortunately, we did not do so, and we are very gratified. Some say that Britain should not handle the naval limitation issue alone, setting aside the land and air disarmament issues. The British government can never endorse this view. Naval limitation treaties have existed for many years. If we cannot renew treaties to replace the existing ones, the harm will be great. This move does not imply that the British government will no longer actively strive to conclude land and air armament treaties if a general naval limitation treaty is concluded in the future. In fact, the British government considers preventing international competition in all three types of armaments to be a matter of utmost importance. Monsell also responded to questions, saying that the government will continue to talk to other naval powers, but he does not know when the countries that signed the naval treaty will be able to hold a plenary meeting. Prime Minister Baldwin also responded to questions about when the House of Commons should choose a day to debate the agreement, saying that Leader of the Opposition Lansbury should prepare for discussion when the First Lord of the Admiralty's official salary is presented for consideration.

<p>(London) According to news reported by the Daily Telegraph, the purpose of Prime Minister Baldwin's meeting with German naval representative Ribbentrop yesterday was to discuss Germany's return to Geneva. This statement has recently been denied by official circles. It is reported that the talks between the British and German representatives, in addition to the naval issue, were only about the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. Britain and France had previously sent notes to the German government, explaining Germany's objections to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. It is reported that Britain has urged Ribbentrop to ensure that Germany responds to the Anglo-French notes as soon as possible. As for the outcome of Baldwin's talks with Ribbentrop, it will be notified to French Prime Minister Laval by Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden, who is currently in Paris. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reported that Prime Minister Baldwin mentioned the issue of Germany's return to the League of Nations during his meeting with Ribbentrop, the chief representative of the German naval delegation. Germany is now preparing to return to the League of Nations under the following two conditions: (1) concluding a Western European Air Pact; (2) the impact of mutual assistance pacts on the Locarno Pact should be satisfactorily explained by the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Rumors have circulated that during talks between German representative Ribbentrop and British cabinet members, the possibility of entrusting a Portuguese colony to German rule was considered. This information has recently been explicitly denied by officials. However, according to sources in Berlin, this approach may be sufficient to compensate for Germany's abandoned plan to expand eastward. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) Ribbentrop, the chief representative of the German naval delegation, went to 10 Downing Street this morning to meet with Prime Minister Baldwin for about an hour. This was the first meeting since the German delegation arrived here. The two delegations then also met to continue negotiating the details of the naval agreement. The next meeting is scheduled for Friday and Saturday, so the German delegation will be unable to leave London until Sunday at the earliest. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) After the Anglo-German naval agreement was established, naval experts from both countries met yesterday to discuss the tonnage of different types of ships. According to information obtained by the Daily Telegraph, the German representative completely agreed with the British proposal that the maximum limit for battleships of all countries in the future should be 25,000 tons. Both sides have also agreed on limiting cruiser tonnage to around 7,000 tons. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Anglo-German naval talks, it is now reported that naval experts from both countries have agreed that the German naval plan will be implemented within seven years. British representatives are now trying to get Germany to agree not to build the full tonnage during this period, leaving a small amount to be completed after 1942. It is generally hoped that Germany will announce its shipbuilding plan until 1942 soon, so that British naval experts can use it as a basis when holding talks with naval representatives from France, Italy, and Russia.

<p>(Berlin) According to estimates published in local newspapers, if Germany builds warships to the maximum limit permitted by the Anglo-German agreement, Germany's fleet will consist of the following: (1) Battleships: six new 25,000-ton ships and four existing 10,000-ton ships; (2) Battlecruisers: five new 10,000-ton ships to the maximum limit, but there are currently no such ships; (3) Light Cruisers: a total of 67,000 tons, in addition to six existing 6,000-ton old ships, five new 6,000-ton ships or eight new 4,000-ton ships can still be built; (4) Destroyers: There are currently twelve 800-ton destroyers, and another 43,000 tons can be built, but the agreement stipulates that this tonnage can be transferred to building light cruisers instead of destroyers, as there is no clear distinction between these two types of ships at present; (5) Aircraft Carriers: Can be built to a limit of 51,000 tons. Germany currently has no such ships, so two 22,000-ton aircraft carriers can be built; (6) Submarines: approximately 23,000 tons, but Germany promises not to exceed 45% of the total tonnage of British submarines. The size of submarines varies greatly, so it is impossible to predict the exact number of submarines Germany will build at this time. Germany is currently building twelve 250-ton submarines, but the London Agreement stipulates that each submarine can reach 2,800 tons. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<p>Capital of Abyssinia: Abyssinian King Selassie sent a note to the Council of the League of Nations, stating that Italy is constantly increasing its troops and transporting military supplies to East Africa, while repeatedly making outrageous remarks that endanger Abyssinia's independence and integrity, in an attempt to prove the correctness of its acts of aggression. This makes the East African war unavoidable. Therefore, Abyssinia requests the League of Nations to pay attention. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government has once again sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, protesting against Italy's attitude and suggesting that a neutral observer committee be immediately appointed to go to the border areas between Abyssinia and Italian territories to inspect the actual situation and investigate the truth of the incident, so as to submit a report to the Council of the League of Nations. The Abyssinian government promises to provide all necessary assistance to these observers to enable them to perform their duties, and all expenses will be borne by Abyssinia.

<p>(Paris) During today's session of the Chamber of Deputies, Prime Minister Laval read out the government's decree extending the term of military service, stating that during this period of troop shortage, new recruits who enlisted in April 1935 will continue to serve for six months after their one-year term of service expires. Soldiers of all levels who enlisted from October 1935 to the end of 1939 will have their military service extended by one year. If security organizations and arms limitation negotiations are unsuccessful, there is no hope of reducing the term of military service. The government has also decided that half of the soldiers whose service expires in April this year will continue to serve until half of the new recruits who enlisted in April have received the minimum amount of training. The decree also expressed gratitude to French volunteers for being discharged from military service by July 1. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<p>Belgrade: Yugoslav Prime Minister Jevtić suddenly resigned today. Subsequently, the ministers of the army, finance, public works, and commerce also successively withdrew from the cabinet.

<p>Belgrade: After the resignation of the Yugoslav Jevtić government last night, Dr. Maček, a prominent leader of the Croat people, was invited today to participate in consultations on the formation of a new cabinet. Maček has accepted this invitation. Maček's efforts to seek Croat autonomy have lasted for many years and have long been feared by the government. In 1933, he was accused of conspiracy to split the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and sentenced to three years in prison. He was released after the assassination of King Alexander. The government's resignation was caused by the withdrawal of three Serbian and Croat cabinet members from the government. After the regent prince and the speakers of both houses of parliament held late-night consultations, they issued an invitation to Maček. Jevtić's trip to Europe has now been canceled, and the conference of the Three Little Entente countries has also been postponed. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Belgrade: The cabinet of Prime Minister Jevtić of Yugoslavia suddenly submitted its resignation on the eve of the political conference of the Little Entente countries. Although this was unexpected, after the recent re-election of the Yugoslav parliament, the parliamentarians of various opposition parties led by Farmers' Party leader Dr. Maček refused to attend, at which time it was generally predicted that this would cause a cabinet crisis. Subsequently, the government parliamentary group in parliament, led by the ministers of internal affairs and justice, openly debated with the opposition parties, while those who advocated loyal cooperation between various constructive elements within the country did not generally agree, and even the Croatian party within the government did not agree with breaking with the opposition parties. Therefore, for several days, various factions have been holding negotiations in a difficult atmosphere in parliament, and the leaders of the Slovenian People's Party, Bishop Krek, and the leader of the Bosnian Muslims, Spaho, suddenly came to the capital, which led to the political crisis. The Jevtić cabinet then submitted its resignation so that the regent could examine the parliamentary situation to make appropriate decisions. After the cabinet resigned, the political conference of the Little Entente countries was postponed indefinitely.

<p>(Tokyo) In addition to the Army Ministry's next fiscal year budget of over 490 million yuan, it plans to request 100 million yuan for air force expansion fees and material preparation fees, bringing the total army expenditure to 600 million yuan. The Navy Ministry, in addition to over 530 million yuan, has a total of 600 million yuan for warship construction fees and land and sea preparation fees. In particular, the Navy Ministry needs to expand its naval plans due to the abolition or revision of the Washington and London Treaties. Therefore, the next fiscal year's national defense expenditure for the army and navy will inevitably reach over 1.2 billion yuan. The difficulty for the government in compiling the budget lies in reconciling national defense expenditure with finance. It is noteworthy how Finance Minister Takahashi will handle this issue between the opinions of the parliament and the cabinet deliberation committee.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 20th, Army Minister Hayashi held a meeting with Vice Minister Hashimoto and Military Affairs Bureau Director Nagata to discuss the policy direction for the Army Ministry's next fiscal year budget request. As a result, Army Minister Hayashi will explain the army's opinions at the cabinet meeting on the 25th. The content is roughly as follows: The Army Ministry considers the current state of national finances and strives to implement budget savings. However, given the current international situation and the need to maintain domestic military industry capabilities, 200 million yuan is required for combat material preparation fees and national defense expansion fees, and 86 million yuan for emergency air force expansion fees. As for the Manchurian Incident expenses and security work, which have not yet been completed, and the construction of permanent facilities for the Kwantung Army, a necessary budget of 150 million yuan is required, the same as this year. The Army Minister will change the explanation of the content of other new plans to seek approval. Therefore, the Army's expenditure for the next fiscal year will reach approximately 600 million yuan.

<p>(Washington) Congress today saw President Roosevelt's new tax proposal and was completely unclear whether there was a request for immediate action. The Senate Finance Committee refused to approve some amendments to the 500 million yuan increase in temporary taxes, which caused a setback to the government's plan. It is expected that President Roosevelt will soon clarify this confusing situation. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that he would not estimate how much revenue the new taxes could bring in unless Congress asked this question. According to private estimates, the revenue from the new taxes is approximately between 750 million yuan and 1 billion yuan per year. Important critics on Wall Street are mostly cautious and unwilling to say much about President Roosevelt's plan to tax wealth redistribution. Some say that the government wants to use the extra taxes, gift taxes, and inheritance taxes to reduce the national debt. This is clearly a mixed method of being radical and steady. However, some people also point out that this is just another step in exploiting the rich. Generally, people expressed concerns about the proposal to increase corporate taxes according to the progressive method, because the taxes on some industries, such as public utilities and railways, are already extremely heavy. If they are burdened further, it will restrict the development of corporate businesses. Some people also say that the new tax plan is simply a declaration of war against business leaders and wealthy people who oppose the New Deal. The authorities stole the politically startling claims of the radicals led by Senator Long and others to prepare for future election competition. This move can be said to be nimble. President Roosevelt's new proposal has now met with opposition, and even those who support the government do not fully agree with it. During the term of this Congress, the President's proposal may not be passed. According to rumors from those close to President Roosevelt, the President may issue another unexpected message today. It is heard that President Roosevelt is currently considering a new national recovery plan to advance simultaneously with the tax plan. Its purpose is to increase the purchasing power of the people. However, an essential condition for this plan is that there must be a definite and unwavering interpretation of interstate commerce that can be tested as to whether it is in conflict with the Constitution.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial collapse in our country, and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult, creating extreme social unrest. Shandong, which is controlled by foreign economic forces, is no exception. Furthermore, local products are stagnant, finance is stagnant, and all industries are on the verge of bankruptcy. The recent situation of finance and local products in Jinan is described below:</p>
<p>Banks and Firms Only Take In, Do Not Lend Out</p>
<p>There are dozens of banks and firms in Jinan, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, the Minsheng Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Continental Bank, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Donglai Bank, the Zhonglu Shandong Commercial Bank, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, as well as the Ping City Official Money Bureau and silver shops. Their main business is mortgage lending on local products. The major local products in Shandong are cotton, peanuts, and grains. This year, due to the stagnant sales of local products and the plummeting prices, the mortgaged goods in most local product firms cannot offset the original mortgage amount. Therefore, all banks and firms have adopted a tightening policy, only taking in and not lending out. It is heard that the Bank of China, which has the most mortgage lending, has also received orders from its head office that the amount of lending must not exceed five million yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Stagnant, Cotton Yarn Weak</p>
<p>Cotton is the largest local product in Shandong. When the new cotton was launched this year, it was still active. American cotton was 55-56 yuan per dan. Recently, sales have been sluggish, and prices have fallen again and again. The price per dan is only around 40 yuan. More than 130,000 bales of cotton are stored in the market, piling up and not moving, which has a great impact on the market. Not only are the flower shops and cotton merchants crying bitterly, but the financial sector is also increasingly affected. The price of each yarn has fallen from more than 190 yuan to more than 180 yuan. Today, the 18th, news came from the Qingdao Exchange that the price of cotton yarn has plummeted by 10 yuan per piece due to the impact of Japanese yarn dumping. The price has fallen to more than 170 yuan, which is also an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>Peanuts Stagnant, 200,000 Bales in Storage</p>
<p>Peanut kernels are also a major local product in Shandong. The initial opening price this year was 7.7 yuan per dan. Currently, the price has fallen again and again, with each dan only worth 5.4 yuan. There are 200,000 bales of peanut kernels in storage in the Jinan market. Although some merchants from Tengxian and Yanzhou have recently purchased a portion, preparing to sell them in the fall, it is also extremely empty, because sales are fundamentally stagnant and it is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Wheat Prices Fall and Rise Again</p>
<p>As for the province's grain, it is still relatively peaceful. A few days ago, wheat was 4.7 yuan per dan, then fell to around 4 yuan. In the past day or two, it has risen again to 4.12 yuan. As of today, the 18th, there are a total of 4,550 tons of wheat in storage in the market. (18th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Taigong was enfeoffed in Qi during the Spring and Autumn period, and established his capital in Linzi. Linzi has a long history and is of important value in archeology. The Central Research Institute and the Provincial Library jointly formed the Shandong Ancient Site Research Association. They first excavated the ancient Tan State near Jinan, and then excavated the former site of Tengxian Tengxue. It was originally planned to continue excavating the Qi capital in Linzi, but it was delayed due to various reasons. It is heard that recently, the ancient city north of Linzi City, which is said to be the former site of the Qi capital, had several kinds of antiques dug out of the ground after the rain the other day by villagers tilling the fields. There were a total of seven pieces of bronze ware, including tripods and plates. Their volume is larger than those commonly seen. There is a lot of soil on them. It has not yet been discovered whether there are any characters. Antique dealers, hearing the news, flocked to investigate. The villagers regarded them as rare goods, asking for 8,000 yuan. Buyers have already paid 800 yuan, but the deal has not yet been completed. It is also heard that there are several pieces of jade, including an ancient jue as large as a plate.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Guangdong Province, East River: Bandit General of Nanshan Eliminated - Numerous Guns and Captured Bandits Seized - <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The bandit nest of Nanshan in the East River of Guangdong Province is located at the junction of Chaoyang, Puning, and Huilai counties. The mountains are steep, and there are 120 villages of various sizes, covering 120 square li. The highest organ of the Communist bandits of the East River was located in this mountain. After the purge in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), the bandit leader Peng Pai led the Communist bandits from Haifeng and Lufeng to twice capture Huilai City. After the bandits were severely suppressed by government troops, they fled into the mountains. Tens of thousands of people in the mountain villages were subjected to "reddening." The garrison Zhang Division once blockaded Nanshan for more than a year, and sent teams into the mountains to patrol, killing more than 3,000 bandits successively. The bandit disaster began to be quelled. Zhang Division then established reclamation offices, recruited refugees, implemented the Baojia system, opened roads, and dispatched two special task force brigades to be stationed in the mountains for a long time to protect traffic and public security. This spring, Zhang Division moved to southern Jiangxi. Before the Deng Division took over, the remnants of Zhang Dingcheng's troops from western Fujian, under pressure from the Central Army, sneaked into Chaozhou Prefecture from the mountains between Fujian and Guangdong, colluded with the remnants of Nanshan bandits, and resumed their activities, looting everywhere. The people suffered greatly. When the Deng Division moved to Chaozhou and Shantou from Anyuan and Xunwu, it reorganized its troops to suppress the bandits in the mountains. On the one hand, it convened a pacification meeting of Chenghai, Chao'an, and Jieyang counties to step up the work of bandit suppression and Baojia in various counties. The military officers who entered the mountains to search for the remaining bandits have repeatedly won victories, seizing a total of 169 long and short guns, two light machine guns, and capturing 152 bandits, including pseudo-Soviet special committee members. 214 pseudo-special committee members, secretaries, section chiefs, directors, and bandits were killed. Sixteen organs such as the bandit military affairs office, repair factory, political capital prison, etc. were destroyed. Eighty-five innocent men and women who had been seized were rescued. Twenty-eight bandits surrendered and thirty-eight long and short guns were brought in by surrendering bandits. Three district and township chiefs who supplied the Communist bandits were executed by firing squad, and one village head who hid bandits was detained for investigation. Currently, the troops are going deep into the mountains to search various caves and are expected to completely eliminate the bandits soon. The bandit area of Fenghuang Mountain on the border of Rao Ping is also being blockaded and encircled by Zeng Youren's Brigade. It is reported that the remaining bandits in the mountains have sneaked back into the mountains of Pinghe and Zhao'an on the Fujian border. (16th)</p>

However, after the change in the historical system, the number of civil and criminal cases appealed to the High Court will inevitably increase. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a fourth civil division and appoint two additional judges. There will also be changes in the prosecutorial officers in various counties, and a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and approval.</p>

<p>Xu Jia, an official of the local Chamber of Commerce, has considerable experience with various machines. Recently, he invented an improved water pumping machine that can not only draw water but also mill rice and propel boats, all using manpower and without electricity. It is extremely light and convenient, unlike the water pumping and rice milling machines on the market, and the price is low. In view of the severe drought in various places, Xu Jun, in order to promote its widespread use, is willing to sell the machine at a low price and hopes that people from all walks of life will actively promote it or cooperate. For inquiries, please contact Mr. Shi Qinglin of the Luhua Nong Xishan News Agency.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Total Silkworm Cocoon Production in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee was organized by the Department of Construction to improve the sericulture industry in Jiangsu Province, significant results have been achieved. Because the quality of silkworm eggs is good, the quality of fresh cocoons produced is higher than that of cocoons produced in other places, and the drying and reeling loss is also shorter. This year's spring market collected more than 350,000 yuan in improvement fees, and a total of 87,000 dan (market weight) of dried cocoons were produced. Based on the calculation of drying one dan of cocoons from 300 jin of fresh cocoons, this is equivalent to 134,000 dan of fresh cocoons. However, farmers in Wujiang, Wuxian, Yixing, Liyang, and other places mostly bake fresh cocoons and reel silk themselves. Wujiang County has the most, with 10,000 zu of fresh cocoons, Wuxian 10,000 dan, and Yixing and Liyang a total of about 5,000 dan, Wuxi 1,000 dan, totaling about 270,000 dan. Currently, the market price of dried cocoons is 90 yuan per dan (Sima weight). A plan should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The conference of directors of stamp, tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus from various provinces under the Tax Administration held a subcommittee meeting yesterday to review the proposals. It was decided to convene a general meeting this morning to present them for discussion. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi made a special trip to the meeting yesterday afternoon to give a speech. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Groups Review</p>
<p>The Review Committee was divided into two groups. The first group consisted of Zhao Xi'en, Sheng Shengyi, Jing Youyan, Jing Xuxin, Huang Zupei, Xue Futian, Yang Duo, Dong Zhongding, Hong Yi, Jiang Yongyi, Fang Yunxian, Li Jialin, Guo Yushan, and Xu Zhijun. Zhao Xi'en was designated as the chairman to review proposals (A), (B), and (C). The second group consisted of Ding Chungao, Wang Guanghui, Tang Yan, Qu Dacheng, Fu Zhengshun, Zhou Jiechun, Tang Shi, Chen Jun, Lu Zongqian, Xu Huiyu, Cheng Luyu, and Xu Yangzheng. Ding Chungao was designated as the chairman to review proposals (D), (E), and (F).</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Arrives</p>
<p>The two groups held meetings simultaneously starting at 9 am yesterday. The first group met in the reception room of the National Tariff Commission of the Customs Administration, and the second group met in the reception room of the Tax Administration. At 11:40 am, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi arrived and was received by Wu Qiding, the director of the Tax Administration. The two subcommittees were notified to suspend their review, and they gathered at the reception room of the Tax Administration, where Minister Kong delivered a speech. They adjourned at about 1 pm. The two groups continued their meetings at 2:30 pm and adjourned after completing their review at about 5 pm. The general meeting will be convened starting at 9 am this morning to discuss the proposals.</p>
<p>Summoning and Instruction</p>
<p>Minister Kong delivered a speech, saying: "The purpose of convening this tobacco and alcohol tax conference of directors of stamp, tobacco, and alcohol bureaus from various provinces has been explained by Director Wu at the opening. My visit today is not to give a lecture, but to listen to the reports of the directors on the tax revenue situation and what contributions they have to make to future improvement measures. At this time of national crisis, all of you are intellectuals and naturally have a strong sense of patriotism. Moreover, you are responsible for the national revenue, so you must do your best to rectify it and enrich the national treasury. Finance is the lifeblood of the country, and it all depends on taxes, which come from the people, but should not harm the people. At present, the main sources of income are customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes. Judging from the results, the consolidated tax is easier to manage, the tax source is concentrated, and since its implementation, it has made progress year by year, and the revenue has increased day by day. However, the stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes have deep-rooted malpractices and are not easy to eliminate. Although they are under the jurisdiction of the Tax Administration, there is still no effective result. Since the stamp tax was entrusted to the post office for sale last year, the revenue has been better, while the tobacco and alcohol taxes remain the same. The reasons for this are nothing more than that those who are in charge are perfunctory and the supervisors are not persistent. In short, the director of the bureau bears the heavy responsibility of the country and cannot just be clean and self-disciplined. They should earnestly rectify matters and pay attention to whether their subordinates are engaging in corruption. If there are any disobedient people, they should be punished. I have always been sincere to my subordinates and will not replace them without a reason. I hope that all directors will be energetic and do their best to rectify and eliminate malpractices with resolute measures in order to enrich the country and benefit the people. If we want to talk about industry, economy, and national defense construction, none of them can be done without money. At this time of national difficulty, all directors should be able to understand this and do their best to alleviate the national crisis. Those who can be loyal and responsible will have unlimited prospects. Those who are perfunctory, irresponsible, or corrupt will not be excused even if they are acquaintances of this minister. I hope everyone will pay attention."</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Approves National Products Alliance</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Promotion Alliance previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, stating that more than 20 companies, including the Shanghai National Products Company, had declared liquidation, and the market crisis was imminent. They requested that the Ministry of Finance take both short-term and long-term measures to provide immediate relief, so that factories that had stopped work could quickly resume production, and factories that had not yet collapsed would not be affected. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued an approval, stating: "We have received your telegram. In order to provide relief to commerce and industry, the Ministry has increased the capital of banks and stipulated ten principles for lending, and has issued separate letters to be followed. Since then, for several months, the amount of new loans and renewals of loans by banks and money shops has exceeded the original limit by a considerable amount. Recently, Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Shanghai Bankers' Association, and others have stated that there are still many commercial and industrial enterprises that continue to request loans from banks and money shops for relief. Representatives of the association, such as Zhang Zilian, have also stated the same situation. We have ordered the banks and money shops to continue to handle this, and the Ministry has issued 20 million yuan of national treasury certificates as the second guarantee for banks and money shops to provide relief to commerce and industry in accordance with the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry. We have issued separate orders to the Shanghai Bankers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to comply. As for the request for relief to various factories, please continue to follow the lending principles set by the Ministry and negotiate with them."</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after various organizations in the city established the Federation for Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam, they separately submitted requests to the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding that the Siamese government be lodged with a serious protest and that a Sino-Siamese commercial treaty be concluded. The federation has now received an approval from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: "We have received your letter requesting that the Siamese government be negotiated with to abolish the newly promulgated harsh regulations and to conclude a commercial treaty as soon as possible. Regarding the issue of the Siamese government's mistreatment of overseas Chinese, the Ministry has repeatedly ordered Ambassador Jiang stationed in Japan to negotiate with the Siamese ambassador stationed in Japan to find ways to abolish them. However, due to the lack of formal diplomatic relations between China and Siam, immediate results have not been achieved. The Ministry has always regarded treaties as the only policy for protecting overseas Chinese, and has repeatedly contacted the Siamese side. Although they have delayed by making excuses, we have continued to inquire at any time. Recently, we have telegraphed Ambassador Jiang to earnestly negotiate with the Siamese ambassador so that Sino-Siamese diplomatic relations can be established as soon as possible. The Siamese ambassador has agreed to forward this to his government. In the future, the Ministry will continue to follow its consistent policy and continue to promote its progress. Please be informed. June 20, 1935, Minister Wang."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company opened the joint water and land transportation of the Longhai Railway, the joint transportation of goods has been very congested, and the original ships are insufficient to handle the load.

It is estimated that the ship will arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Yangtze River Public Pooling by Six Companies: Employing Chinese and Foreign Experts, Forming Freight Committee, Yichang Line Also Included <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The scope of the Yangtze River public pooling alliance of six companies is expanding, and there are no restrictions on companies joining. The ships of Nissin Kisen Kaisha, which have suspended sailing, may also join the apportionment. Foreign companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson's ships above Hankou, such as the Yichang and Changsha lines, are also included in the public pooling alliance. Not only are they accommodated as much as possible, but it is also agreed that the iron barges of the six companies on the Yangtze River in the middle and lower reaches shall also be allowed to join the pooling scope. This has been specified in the nineteen-article contract that has been officially decided.</p>
<p>Business Overview: The implementation of public pooling on the Yangtze River was initiated by the Ministry of Communications, and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company strongly promoted it. According to the survey and statistics of the six companies, the tonnage of each ship must be determined by the ship surveyor and listed as the recognized tonnage. The more ships there are, the greater the volume of goods transported, and the more cost-effective the business will be. After it is implemented on July 1, the most beneficial company among the six companies is Butterfield &amp; Swire, followed by Jardine Matheson, followed by Sannorth, and Nissin. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships are not as beneficial as Sannorth because they have more passenger seats and less cargo volume. The amount of cargo for public pooling is based on the exchange of cargo manifests between the six companies, and the customs general manifest is the basis.</p>
<p>Determining Experts: Although the calculation of public pooling on the Yangtze River by the six companies is based on 50% of the total tonnage of the ships, the ships are of different sizes and the amount of cargo varies, making the calculation of apportionment extremely difficult. It is difficult for non-experts to calculate accurately. Therefore, after discussion by the six companies, two Chinese and Western accounting specialists were specially hired to be responsible for calculating the public pool accounts. The Western expert has been appointed Thompson, and the Chinese expert has been appointed Xi Yushu. Both are paid a salary of 1,000 yuan. The letters of appointment have been issued.</p>
<p>Freight Meeting: The six companies have also agreed to form two groups of meetings composed of important officials selected from within each company. Group A is composed of managers and directors of each company to discuss all major issues concerning business and the alliance. Group B is composed of business directors and chief clerks selected by each company. A freight committee is formed within Group B to discuss the increase in round-trip shipping costs and the determination of various cargo commissions after public pooling. It is currently being actively organized.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Aivelo Company Hosted Reporters Yesterday: Test Ride of the Autogiro Aircraft, Equipment All Improved, Very Fast Takeoff and Landing, Suitable for Passengers, Cargo, Bombing, and Reconnaissance <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The latest British-made Autogiro aircraft was brought to Shanghai from Hong Kong a few weeks ago by Mr. Bennett, manager of the Far East Aviation Company at No. 88 Museum Road in this city. It was immediately assembled temporarily in the hangar of the China Aviation Corporation in Longhua. After a test flight the day before yesterday afternoon, yesterday afternoon at about 3 p.m., Chinese and foreign reporters were invited for a public demonstration, personally piloted by Mr. Bennett. The aircraft is a land-based type, about 10 feet long, with a single engine (140 horsepower). The fuselage is painted yellow, with black stripes at the tail end. It has no front wings, and the rear wings extend to 45 feet. At the top of the aircraft, there is an upward-pointing rotor with three blades, each 7-8 inches wide and 7 feet long. During takeoff, the two front upper rotors are used simultaneously, so it only needs to taxi for 30-40 yards before the fuselage can leave the ground. When landing, the tires touch down, and it can stop within 3-5 yards. It would even be possible to take off and land on a larger rooftop. Although the aircraft's speed is not very high, its ability to hover in the air for some time due to the upward-pointing rotor is particularly valuable. The aircraft weighs only 1,281 pounds, and one person can push it out of the hangar. It can carry 264 pounds of fuel and oil, with a maximum payload of 1,900 pounds. After two demonstration flights, Mr. Peng Te, director of the aviation department of the China Aviation Corporation, was invited for the first test ride.</p>
<p>Features of the Aircraft</p>
<p>The Autogiro aircraft also has the following features: (1) It can be used for transportation and is more suitable for passenger transport. The interior of the aircraft has foldable seats, which can be folded up to carry cargo. (2) Whether transporting cargo, passengers, or mail, it can arrive on time within a certain period. (3) It can be used for security purposes. (4) It can be used for bombing. (5) It can be used for sowing seeds. (6) It can be used for reconnaissance. (7) It does not require a fixed route. (8) It can be used for scientific exploration, etc. The aircraft is equipped with a 140-horsepower engine, with a speed of 90-95 miles per hour, and a maximum speed of 110-115 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Brief History of the Invention</p>
<p>The Autogiro aircraft was invented by Señor don Juan de la Cierva. He began research in 1919, first made the machinery in 1924, and succeeded in 1925. In the same year, the Aivelo Company began manufacturing it. The test flight yesterday was piloted by the famous pilot Lieutenant L.D. Pennett, with more than a dozen reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers attending.</p>

Therefore, the company has not yet finalized the calculations. However, according to the person in charge of the preparatory office, if the public offering is not fully subscribed, the promoters will make up the difference. Therefore, the total capital of 3 million yuan can definitely be raised. Preparations are now actively underway, and a promoters' meeting will be held in the coming days to determine the date of establishment, the internal organization, and the establishment of distribution points. Furthermore, according to the purpose of the company's establishment, it is to promote domestically produced sugar. Therefore, it has separately contacted domestic sugar production companies to sell on their behalf. It is reported that the selling price will be determined and announced by the newly established Sugar Management Committee of the Ministry of Finance, to unify market prices and prevent speculation by merchants. Furthermore, at the beginning of the company's establishment, sugar merchants believed that it would monopolize the sugar market with a large amount of capital and a complete sales organization. Therefore, the sugar merchants were suspicious of each other and unwilling to subscribe for shares to participate. Now, after the company's explanation, the doubts have been cleared, and there are quite a few people who subscribe for shares and are willing to cooperate.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Xinjiang Steamer Ready After Rectification: Resumes Shanghai-Ningbo Route Today, Regular Stewards Will Be Re-employed, Stewards' Representatives Petitioned Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau's Xinjiang Steamer has temporarily suspended sailing to rectify the stewards and eliminate bad habits. All regular stewards have been registered in accordance with the regulations, and the bureau issued badges yesterday, deciding to re-employ all of them. However, they will be paid a monthly salary of 16 yuan, and will not be allowed to solicit tips from passengers in the future. If such behavior occurs, they will be dismissed upon discovery. The bureau also found that the arrangement of bunks in various parts of the ship was not uniform, so it hired workers to dismantle them the night before last, and will re-install them according to the situation, in order to make them tidy and benefit travelers. The ship is scheduled to resume sailing today.  A group of stewards formed a petition group. All stewards of the ship said that they were willing to accept this order of rectification by the bureau, as it concerned administration, and there was no resistance. However, they requested improvement because the measures were too strict and would have a great impact on their livelihoods in the future, in order to provide relief. At 7 a.m. yesterday, a joint meeting of cadres and team leaders was held at the Seamen's Anlu Association in Xiaonanmen. Zhao Ruilong was elected chairman. First, the chairman reported that all workers should unanimously support this rectification by the bureau, but the bureau should still consider the workers' difficulties and make improvements where there are major obstacles to their livelihoods. Therefore, a meeting was convened to discuss solutions. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Organize a petition delegation of stewards from the Xinjiang Steamer, and elect Hu Baoquan, Ni Amao, Wang Mingbao, Zhou Longdao, Zhao Ruilong, Li Quangen, Li Baoyuan, Sun Ayuan, and nine others as representatives. (2) All workers should listen to the command of the delegation and should not act without authorization. (3) Issue a declaration to all sectors of society, stating the workers' suffering and requesting understanding. The first meeting of the delegation was held in the afternoon, with all representatives present. Chairman Zhou Longdao resolved: (1) The bureau will issue badges this afternoon, and Committee Member Yang of the Seamen's Association will be asked to collect them and distribute them to the workers. (2) Continue to appeal to all parties, demanding to maintain the original living conditions.</p>
<p>Stating Suffering: The delegation went to the China Merchants Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday to petition General Manager Liu Hongsheng, stating the workers' suffering, saying, in brief, that all workers accepted the bureau's rectification of discipline, but the fixed wages were meager. According to the previous income from tips, each person earned about 30-40 yuan. Now, suddenly changing to a salary of 16 yuan is equivalent to cutting more than half, which will be difficult for the workers to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, they requested that ways be found to improve the situation. It is reported that the delegation also plans to appeal to all parties for assistance in maintaining their livelihoods.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Students of the Municipal Party Department's Workers' Training Institute Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday Morning: Representatives of Party and Government Agencies Attended and Gave Instructions, Deputy Director Zhu Xuefan Issued Certificates <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung News Agency, the first class of students from the Workers' Movement Training Institute, organized by the Municipal Party Department, held a graduation ceremony at Qiaojia Hongmei Family Park at 10 a.m. yesterday. Lu Jingshi and Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Department, Cai Jinjun (representing Jin Dianyang) from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Tu Jiyi from the Security Office, Wang Gang from the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Gongzhan (representing Jiang Jianbai) from the Education Bureau, Zhou Xuexiang and Ye Xianggao from the General Labor Union, Ye Guanqian from the District Party Department, Xiao Huiqing from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Yu Songqiao and Xu Duo from the Postal Workers' Union, and representatives from various labor unions such as the shipbuilding industry in District 1 and the cotton weaving industry in District 10, totaling more than 200 students, were received by Deputy Director Zhu Xuefan, Training Director Zhao Shusheng, and Education Director Wen Zhuangyou. The postal workers' band provided music.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Zhu Xuefan gave a report on behalf of Director Wu Xingya, saying that he was deeply moved by the representatives of the Party and government agencies and various labor unions attending. The Workers' Movement Training Institute was established by the Municipal Party Department and has been under the leadership of Director Wu for more than five months. With the support of all parties and the guidance of teachers and instructors, we are holding a graduation ceremony here today. In the past history of the Chinese workers' movement, there has always been a lack of talent and a lack of organization. There has been no sufficient representation of power for society and the country. However, the workers' movement occupies an important position in the modern revolutionary process, not only limited to assisting the use of military and political power, but also greatly related to economic resources and the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce. Looking back on the past closures of yarn and silk factories, social economics have formed an unease, the state of affairs is chaotic, and the spirit of the people is depressed. The purpose and expectation of the training institute organized by the Municipal Party Department is to create a group of passionate young people to fight for the country, sacrifice for society, save the country from danger, and promote the workers' movement. After all the students graduate and leave school, they will step into the social journey, seek a living, and at the same time, start leading the workers' movement. He hoped that the superiors would provide guidance from time to time to correct deficiencies. On the one hand, he hoped that all students would apply their school experience and knowledge to society, and be determined to be hardworking and resilient, unify their thoughts, be full of spirit, and shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and the nation. In the near future, the Shanghai workers' movement will, after being infused with this new element, be promoted and developed in the face of internal and external troubles, maintaining its permanent atmosphere.</p>
<p>Party Department's Instructions</p>
<p>Lu Jingshi, representing the Municipal Party Department, delivered an instruction speech, saying that since the Workers' Movement Training Institute was established, with the efforts of the director, deputy director, and all the faculty and staff, the training period of five months has been completed. The opening and graduation ceremonies are the same, but their natures are different. Today, on behalf of the Municipal Party Department, I am attending the ceremony to tell the students what I have learned. In this recession, it is most difficult to carry out the workers' movement. In the stage of economic warfare of imperialism in our country, on the one hand, the lives of workers cannot be improved, but even reduced wages, reduced salaries, and increased unemployment, and on the other hand, the output of capital is accumulated, business is sluggish, cleared and closed. The national workers' movement is difficult to develop due to these reasons. All the students have a deep understanding of the social situation. After these months of training, their will is unified and their knowledge is sufficient to deal with it, and they can still achieve excellent results. He hoped that all the students would engage in leading the workers' movement, (1) not seek fame and fortune, but be practical and realistic, (2) not improve their lives, but be thrifty and honest, cultivate morality and personality, (3) have a strong will, not be passive, not be timid, and be full of the spirit of sacrifice and struggle. Then Jiang Jianbai, representing the Municipal Education Bureau, Wang Jiyi, representing the Security Bureau, Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, and Zhou Lianze gave speeches (the words are omitted).</p>
<p>Students' Reply</p>
<p>After the representatives of the various organizations finished speaking, Deputy Director Zhu Xuefan issued graduation certificates, and then Lu Baozhi, a representative of the students, delivered a reply speech, saying that the instructions and encouragement given by the representatives of the various organizations and the leaders of the labor world were to be taken as golden rules. After graduating and leaving school, they will gradually practice the teachings of the teachers on weekdays, according to various situations. He deeply hoped that the representatives would give instructions and guidance at any time, and he was very grateful.</p>

<p>The scope of travel for cars in the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai is said to have expanded compared to the past. Because the 10th Standing Committee of the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities has resolved to invite Jiangxi Province to join the scope of mutual access, all private cars in the five provinces and cities can now have mutual access with Jiangxi Province. However, commercial vehicles will be temporarily delayed. This measure has been ordered by the municipal government to be announced and publicized by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company began selling monthly tickets, local people have praised them for their convenience. Seeing that more and more people are buying them, the company is now selling autumn season tickets starting on the 25th of this month to further enhance convenience for passengers and avoid the trouble of changing tickets every month.

<p>As the summer season arrives, more and more people are going to Qingdao and Putuo to escape the heat. Last year, the China Merchants Bureau designated the Puan ship to sail specifically between these locations, which was convenient for travelers. This year, the China Merchants Bureau changed the Puan ship to another route, and all routes that were specifically sailing to Qingdao and Putuo from Shanghai during the summer fell into the hands of foreign merchants. The outflow of money is deeply regrettable. In view of this, the Sanbei Shipping Company, which is operated by Chinese people, has specially designated the Jingan and Ningxing ships to take over this responsibility. The Jingan ship has a load of 3,000 tons and is one of the largest ships in our country. It has more than 40 first- and second-class dining rooms, and its perfect equipment and thoughtful service have long been famous. It is scheduled to sail specifically to Qingdao on the 25th of this month, and the Ningxing ship will sail specifically to Putuo on the 29th. Those who want to book seats can contact the China Travel Service at No. 420 Sichuan Road for everything. The telephone number is 13450.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Municipal Health Bureau: Inspects Summer Drinks, Many Are Harmful to Health, Citizens Should Pay Attention <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent gastrointestinal infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery, the Health Bureau pays close attention to the soft drinks and other refreshing drinks sold on the market in the summer. Because there are many varieties and many people drink them, if they are not pure, they will greatly harm the health of drinkers. However, whether these beverages are pure or not can only be accurately judged after inspection. Therefore, the Health Bureau ordered the Health Testing Institute to collect as many soft drinks and vegetable seed dew as possible sold on the market and inspect them in detail. It has now inspected 21 types of soft drinks, and only Coca-Cola, Russian, Meiguli, and Kuzhe soft drinks have passed the inspection. It has inspected 44 types of vegetable seed dew, and only the Black Gauze House vegetable seed dew and the China Food Company's Star and Moon brand banana fruit dew have passed the inspection. A total of 3 types of sour plum juice have been inspected, but only one has passed. All those that did not pass had too many bacteria and did not meet the standards for municipal refreshing drinks. If they contain germs, it is easier to get sick after drinking them. The Health Bureau has notified the manufacturers of those that did not pass the inspection to make practical improvements so that they can be inspected again. If germs are found after inspection, they will be banned from sale.</p>

It is more convenient and suitable for Chinese people's habits than Western hospitals. In addition to being suitable for treating various chronic diseases, such as bronchitis, neurasthenia, smoking cessation, anemia, and gastrointestinal diseases, the sanatorium also has exquisitely decorated air-conditioned hand washing rooms and delivery rooms. The disinfection is extremely complete, and it is very convenient to perform various major operations.

The sanatorium's facilities are designed by experts, and the medical equipment is state-of-the-art. The location is secluded, and the air is fresh. There are long-distance public buses from Nanshi and Shanghai that go directly to the sanatorium. The sanatorium is scheduled to invite reporters from various newspapers to visit today (the 22nd) at 2:00 PM, with transportation provided. A banquet will be held for the press at 6:00 PM that afternoon, during which Vice Director Lu Yingen will report on the establishment of the sanatorium.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government has been working hard to implement the Great Shanghai Plan, the central business district is becoming increasingly prosperous, and various constructions are progressing rapidly. Facilities such as sports fields, museums, libraries, and hospitals are being rushed to completion. The population density is gradually increasing, and tourists from all walks of life are constantly visiting, all wanting to see the results of this grand plan. However, there are currently no perfect dining establishments in the area, and tourists from afar often suffer from the lack of places to eat when hungry. Local residents also find it inconvenient to dine out due to the distance from the city center. Recently, the New Asia Hotel, at the request of the Central Company, has opened a Chinese and Western cuisine restaurant with an ice shop on Shiguang Road to benefit tourists and residents. Preparations are now complete, and the opening was held yesterday. More than 200 guests attended, including Li Dachao from the Municipal Government, Xu Guanyi from the Bureau of Public Works, Xia Peide from the City Bank, Huang Qigang from the Public Security Bureau, and guests from various circles. The heavy rain did not diminish the grand occasion. With the New Asia Hotel's power of management, perfection is self-evident. From now on, the problems of rest for tourists and banquets for residents will also be solved. It is said that it will be further promoted in the Municipal Park and sports fields in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has submitted a document to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to request the correction of the abuse of litigation fees. The original submission is excerpted below: The document is submitted for referral. According to a letter from member Huang Han, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court is abusing litigation fees. Please negotiate with the association. The matter should be handled by Mr. Xiang Zhang (full text omitted). After the association's staff reviewed the matter, they stated that "Revised Article 7 of the Rules on Litigation Fees stipulates that civil application fees are classified as trial fees. Therefore, various applications for trial should be paid. After the judgment is final, various applications for execution should not be charged again if the execution fee has already been paid. Member Huang's proposal is reasonable." The 198th joint meeting of the association's executive and supervisory committees resolved to forward the request to your court for correction. We hereby submit this document to request your court's review and implementation for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, with the seals of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, Shen Junru, Chen Rui, and Wang Weizhen.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Chen Liqing and Son Accused of Abandonment by Daughter-in-Law, Case Withdrawn Due to Procedural Irregularities, Must First Report to Police <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Chen Liqing, a wealthy hardware merchant from Guangdong with over two million in assets, and his son, Chen Guohua, were recently sued for criminal abandonment by Chen's daughter-in-law, Chen Tang Deyi (40 years old, resident of No. 91, Yongan Li, North Sichuan Road, Guohua's wife). She hired lawyer Xiong Fei and filed the lawsuit with the First Special District Court, requesting that they be punished according to Article 310 of the Criminal Law and demanding 84,600 yuan for living and medical expenses as a civil suit attachment. According to the suit, Tang Deyi came from a prominent family. At the age of 18, while studying in Shanghai, she was seen by Chen Guohua, who was captivated by her beauty. He immediately proposed to Tang's parents, vowing to die if the marriage did not succeed. Tang's family, out of pity, agreed to the marriage. However, Tang contracted an illness, so the marriage was postponed until 1916. After the marriage, Chen Guohua did not work and relied entirely on his father's support. Later, Tang's adoptive father, Mo Gansheng, returned from overseas and saw that Tang Deyi was suffering intolerable abuse from her in-laws. He bought her a house on Avenue Joffre and invested 40,000 taels to help Chen obtain a position as a compradore at the Han Yun Foreign Firm. From then on, Chen Guohua's life became increasingly affluent, and he indulged in pleasure, spending money like water, leading to mounting debts. Tang pawned her private jewelry for 2,000 yuan to repay the debts. However, Guohua, as a prodigal son, cohabitated with a woman surnamed Yu and a prostitute. He even raped his sister-in-law (Tang's younger sister), causing her to become pregnant. After giving birth, he abandoned her again. Tang gave birth to five children. During the January 28th Incident, Tang went to Hong Kong to mediate because her husband and adoptive father, Mo Gansheng, were in constant litigation. Chen placed the children with his sister in Hong Kong for Tang to raise. However, he did not provide any living expenses for the children. Tang was also seriously ill at this time, but he did not provide any medical expenses. In September, when she recovered from her illness and returned to Shanghai, she discovered that Chen Guohua was cohabitating with a tutor, Cai Huiying. Upon seeing Tang, he verbally abused her and moved all the furniture out of the house, never visiting Tang again. His father, Chen Liqing, although possessing over two million in assets, was also stingy with providing living expenses for his daughter-in-law. Therefore, she believed it was a clear case of joint abandonment by father and son and filed the lawsuit. The attached civil suit requested 72,000 yuan for Tang's monthly living expenses of 300 yuan for 20 years, plus 12,600 yuan for medical and other expenses. Judge Jiang Shuzi of the First Special District Court accepted the case. Based on Article 339 of the Criminal Procedure Law, spouses are not allowed to sue each other. Therefore, Tang Deyi was only summoned to the Criminal Court 8 yesterday afternoon and informed that spouses cannot sue each other. The procedure was thus deemed non-compliant. She should first report to the police for prosecution to be legitimate; otherwise, the case should be withdrawn to file a report to the police. If the case is not withdrawn and a report is filed with the police, the police will not accept it because a case cannot be pursued in two ways. Tang and her lawyer, upon hearing this, immediately expressed their willingness to withdraw the case and file a report with the police instead. Judge Jiang then declared the case inadmissible.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Pawned Warehouse Receipt Disowned Upon Maturity, Rong Zongjing Accused, Rong Failed to Appear Yesterday, Summons Re-scheduled <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Flour magnate Rong Zongjing has been greatly affected by the recent economic downturn. His flour business has not been profitable, and his spinning mill has failed, leading to a mountain of debt and nearing bankruptcy, resulting in numerous lawsuits. In February of last year, Rong urgently needed funds, so he used a warehouse receipt from the Shenxin Third Spinning Mill in his hometown of Wuxi under the name of Fuxin Flour Company to mortgage for 60,000 yuan to the Xin Kang firm in this city, signing a mortgage agreement. When the term expired, Rong had no funds to repay the loan. Therefore, the creditor, according to the agreed terms, sent a letter to the Shenxin Third Mill in Wuxi, instructing them to deliver the 400 bales of cotton yarn listed on the pawned warehouse receipt as collateral. Unexpectedly, the mill replied to Xin Kang, denying that the goods were mortgaged, stating that "Our mill has no dealings with your firm, and this mortgage cannot be recognized. Please contact the original handler." However, Xin Kang believes that the mortgage agreement was personally signed by Rong Zongjing and that he is now trying to deny it, which constitutes intentional fraud. Sun Bosheng, representing Xin Kang, has filed a criminal self-accusation against Rong Zongjing for fraud and obtaining property. Yesterday afternoon, a judge from the First Special District Local Court held a hearing at Xiang Yinghua. The defendant, Rong Zongjing, failed to appear. Sun Bosheng recounted the mortgage process and presented the mortgage agreement and warehouse receipt. He further clarified the effect of the warehouse receipt, stating that in the market, warehouse receipts for goods are considered equivalent to the actual goods. If the warehouse receipt cannot be used to collect the goods, it is no different from a blank check. In other words, a warehouse receipt is the actual goods. Although the warehouse receipt mortgaged by the defendant is valid, because the mill denied the mortgage, it was impossible to collect the goods. However, the defendant is the general manager of Fuxin and Shenxin mills. Since he used the mill's warehouse receipt to borrow funds and failed to repay it upon maturity, he should allow the goods to be collected. His refusal to deliver the goods constitutes fraud and obtaining property. The court stated that the case involves fraud and that the defendant should appear in court to provide evidence. The hearing was adjourned to the afternoon of the 18th of this month, and Rong Zongjing was summoned to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>The Takahama Seaside Resort, since being taken over by the city this year and entrusted to the Xingye Reliance Society, has been greatly renovated and is brand new. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the resort is scheduled to open today. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Various Features (1) The sand on the beach of the Takahama Seaside Resort was originally a kind of bright, clean, and fine sand, lovely and delightful. However, it was mixed with stones and uneven. This year, the stones have been removed and sifted, and fine sand has been added, making it soft and comfortable. (2) The tides of the sea are signaled by bells and flags. Markers are also erected in deep-water areas to ensure safety. (3) New pools, water towers, and showers have been built, and hot and cold-water faucets have been installed for bathing. (4) There are thousands of mu of open space in the resort, which can be used to build temporary summer villas, saving Shanghainese people the trouble of traveling to other cities. (5) A lake has been specially opened in the resort, with a pavilion built in the center of the lake, bounded by a long dike, bridged by wooden bridges, and with vast, shaded walkways. Over four thousand trees have been planted, and over five hundred square feet of lawn has been laid, with flourishing flowers and trees and green grass like a carpet.</p>
<p>Water and Land Transportation The City Ferry has built a new No. 6 ferry this year. The speed and decoration are superior to those of the No. 5 ferry. The front deck is also equipped with copper windows that can be opened and closed at any time depending on the weather. It will join the Shanghai-Songjiang line on the first of next month and operate to Takahama, providing extra comfort for tourists. As for land transportation, the road from Takahama Wharf to the seaside has been widened by the Bureau of Public Works. In addition to the original six buses, four new buses have recently been added to the route, making it smooth and comfortable. Compared to previous years, it is like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Dining Facilities The resort has a large-scale dining hall that can accommodate 400 people for meals. It is covered with emerald green Spanish-style roof tiles and surrounded by steel windows, making it extremely bright. Looking far away, the water and sky merge into one, and the scenery is excellent. The various foods are generally handled by the City Ferry, with French-style Western food and Yangzhou snacks, which are clean, tasty, and reasonably priced.</p>

<h3 id="e133">The Chinese Red Cross Society Second Hospital to Cease Operations <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Outpatient Services Cease on the 20th, Expediting Closure, Inpatients Transferred to Other Hospitals, Employee Salaries Paid Until the End of June</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society Second Hospital, located at No. 856 Xinzha Road, ceased operations on the 20th of this month (the day before yesterday). The hospital is currently expediting its closure in order to hand over the premises. Inpatients have also been transferred to other hospitals. Employee salaries were paid yesterday. The Datong News Agency reporter has gathered the following details:</p>
<p>Brief History of the Hospital The hospitals established by the Shanghai General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society are divided into the First Hospital, the Second Hospital, and the Third Hospital. The First Hospital is located at No. 363 Haig Road and is headed by Mr. Yan Fuqing. The Third Hospital is located at the Dada Wharf on the Outer Bund in Nanshi and is headed by Mr. Wang Yiting. The hospital that is ceasing operations is the Second Hospital, located at No. 856 Xinzha Road, which is headed by Mr. Wang Peiyuan. The vice-director and medical director is Mr. Xu Zhaorong.</p>
<p>Medical Facilities The Second Branch has been established for over 20 years. The original location was on Tianjin Road, then Beijing Road, and finally moved to Xinzha Road. The hospital is relatively large in scale, and the medical facilities are extremely complete. It has eight wards with first, second, and third class rooms, with a total of 61 beds. There are eight physicians, including the medical director, 33 nurses and staff, and 18 servants, totaling 48 people.</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure The General Headquarters is now saving expenses and implementing austerity measures. After deliberation by the board of directors, it was decided to close the hospital. The upper level of the hospital will be used as the General Headquarters' office, and the lower level will still operate an outpatient department in the future. After the board of directors made the decision, the hospital was notified and ordered to begin closing on the 20th of this month. Employee salaries were also paid in full by the General Headquarters yesterday afternoon, up to the end of June.</p>
<p>Disposition of Patients As of the 20th of this month, there were still 35 patients in the hospital. In the afternoon, the General Headquarters sent staff to properly transfer one person to the First Hospital on Haig Road, seven people to the Third Hospital on the Outer Bund in Nanshi, and nine people to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road. The remaining 18 people were taken back by the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society and transferred to other hospitals on their own.</p>
<p>Handling of Closure Most of the hospital's physicians, nurses, staff, and servants have remained at the hospital and are currently handling the closure in preparation for the handover. Food is also being maintained by the General Hospital as usual for the time being. However, according to the hospital's staff, they have served at the hospital for many years. Now that it is closed, they hope that the General Headquarters can provide some severance pay to help them return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Notice of Ceasing Outpatient Services The hospital's notice of ceasing outpatient services is excerpted below: We hereby inform you that this hospital has received a letter from the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society stating that the first board of directors meeting has resolved to close the Second Hospital immediately and move the General Headquarters' office in, etc. In accordance with this order, outpatient services will be suspended from the 20th of this month, and no new inpatients will be admitted in order to complete the closure. This notice is hereby issued for general information. Chinese Red Cross Society Second Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Kidnapping of Li Guanlin's Young Son: Thirty Kidnappers Arrested, Second Special Court Interrogates Suspects Yesterday, Mastermind of Kidnapping is Li Guanlin's Brother-in-Law <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>—Those Deemed Unrelated to the Case Will Be Sent Back to the Place Where the Crime Occurred for Handling—</p>
<p>Li Guanlin, a local villager residing at the Li family residence on the western end of Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, is thirty-six years old and makes a living as a farmer. Over the years, he has diligently cultivated the land and acquired several acres of property. His wife, Mrs. Wang, is thirty-eight years old and has given birth to four daughters and one son. The youngest son, named Jinxiang, is three years old. His elderly mother used to treat children for fright-related illnesses, and Li has accumulated considerable wealth. However, his timid nature has attracted the attention of bandits. On the evening of the thirteenth of last month, around 7:00 PM, while Li's wife was returning home and was sitting with his mother and children around the stove having dinner, three kidnappers suddenly arrived, all dressed in black. They knocked on the door, claiming to be requesting the old lady to see a sick child. Li's third daughter, unaware of the deception, opened the door and let them in. One of the bandits immediately monitored Li's movements, brandishing a pistol and threatening him not to panic. Another monitored everyone in the house, while the third snatched Li's son, Jinxiang, from his wife Wang's arms, covering the child's mouth to prevent him from crying out. They then rushed out the door and fled. As they left, the bandits fired a warning shot into the air and ran away. Li and his family were stunned and dared not resist or raise an alarm. They watched the kidnappers disappear into the distance before reporting the incident to the French police station on Avenue Petain, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, Li received repeated letters from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan for the child's release, which was later reduced to 50,000 yuan. Despite Li entrusting someone to negotiate with the kidnappers five times, an agreement could not be reached due to the significant difference in the amounts. The day before yesterday, Li received another letter from the kidnappers, asking Li to be in Zhabei between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM on the 20th, and specified that the representative must be bald, wear a long black cloth gown, hold a newspaper in one hand and a sugarcane in the other as a sign. They also specified the route: going north from Xinza Bridge on Datong Road, turning right onto Xinmin Road, crossing the dry bridge, heading north on Minde Road, east on Hongjiang Road, Huwen Road, to Zhonghua Xin Road, where someone would come to negotiate. Upon receiving the letter, Li entrusted his brother-in-law, Chen Er'a (aka Chen Yongxiang, 35 years old, residing at No. 11 Tangjiabang, Pudong, a tailor who runs a tailoring stall, Li's younger sister, named Xiannan, was lured away by Chen six years ago on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month and later became his wife), to act as his representative. Following the instructions, Chen went on time to negotiate with the kidnappers. This matter was detected by Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French police, who, at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, led interpreters Li Xianyang, detectives Zhou Buguang, Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detectives Qin Youyu, Detectives Zhong Benchang, Dai Rongji, Wu Wengang, Yang Jiaxue, and others to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau, requesting police detectives to disguise themselves and lie in ambush near the dry bridge on Xinmin Road. Soon, a man wearing a white cloth short gown and black cloth trousers (i.e., the kidnapper Zhao Taotao), holding an umbrella, was seen standing in front of No. 510 Xinmin Road, waiting for two hours. At noon, when the principal's representative, Chen Er'a, passed by, he did not speak to the kidnapper and went straight ahead. After a while, two men were seen passing by the dry bridge on Xinmin Road, talking to the man with the umbrella, asking about how Chen Er'a was approaching the matter. The detectives, who were disguised and waiting nearby, overheard these words and were certain that the three were kidnappers. They immediately arrested the three and took them to the Public Security Bureau. Under interrogation, they confessed their names: Zhao Taotao (26 years old, from Zhenjiang, lives at No. 10, Lane 191, Jialan Road, unemployed), Dong Aqing (31 years old, from Nantong, lives at No. 5, Ranggui Lane, Haining Road, works as a cook), and Chen Jinsheng (aka Zhou Yunda, 31 years old, from Nantong, lives in a bungalow at No. 238, Lane Awenyi Road, Parker Road, works as a rickshaw puller). According to Zhao's confession, the kidnapping was masterminded and planned by the principal's brother-in-law, Chen Er'a, to demand a ransom. Yao Shaobai, who lives at No. 2 Zichai Xia Road, and Fang Dairang, who lives at No. 714 Yangshupu Road, must be detained before the matter can be resolved. The detectives then took Yao, Dong, and Chen back to the police station. Meanwhile, they went to the principal's house to arrest the main suspect, Chen Er'a. They also went to No. 2 Zixia Road and arrested Yang Shaobai (aka Yang Shanchang, 40 years old, from Haimen), Gu Linshi (30 years old, from Songjiang, lives at No. 79 Langjia Bridge, Nanshi, works in iron carriage tailoring), Ji Xiucheng (33 years old, from Chongming, lives at No. 56 Xiexing Lane, Haichao Road, Nanshi, a vendor). They also went to No. 714 Yangshupu Road and arrested Fang Dairang (46 years old, from Chongming, a worker) and Fang's mistress, Chen Zhu (40 years old, from Chongming), Xu Longtou (32 years old, from Shanghai, lives at No. 10, Lane 191, Lan Road), Lu Zhihai (20 years old, from Yangzhou, lives with Xu Longtou). They then went to Room 1 of the Fuxing Hotel at No. 717 Beile Road and arrested suspects Hu Youhua (46 years old, from Haimen, lives in Yejia Lane, Dananmen, owner of Changchun Teahouse), Xu Weimin (aka Li Huiming, 30 years old, from Haiyan, Zhejiang, works in advertising, residing at No. 851 Beile Road), Wang Jinxiang (aka Wang Wei, 33 years old, from Ningbo, lives at No. 9 Yejia Lane, Dananmen), Zhang Shenggen (27 years old, from Qidong), Zhang Xiaogen (29 years old, from Haimen, lives at No. 84 Gongyi Lane, Yangshupu Road), Du Jinqing (49 years old, from Shanghai, lives at No. 10 Du Family Residence, Caojiadu North), Chen Caiqing (13 years old, from Haimen, lives at No. 21 Lan Road, Yangshupu Road), Wang He (30 years old, from Nantong, lives at No. 51 Lan Road, Yangshupu Road), Shi Lao'er (43 years old, from Haimen, lives at No. 53 Deyuan Lane, Shenjia Beach, Yangshupu Road), Chen Liangshi (46 years old, from Haimen, lives at No. 8 Tangjiabang, Yinxiang Port), Zhu Xiaobao (26 years old, from Qidong), Zhang Yuanliang (34 years old, from Haimen), Shen Yucheng (27 years old, from Qidong, lives in a bungalow on Mayushan Road), and thirteen others. Finally, based on the guidance of the arrested Fang Dairang, they went to a thatched hut in the fields of Jiangxinsha, Pudong, and retrieved the kidnapped child, arresting the guards Su Zhaogen (32 years old, from Chongming, the owner of the house where the child was hidden), Yang Hongde (43 years old, from Nantong), Shi Nianqing (29 years old, from Haimen), Huang Jiuchu (from Chongming), Wu Zufang (30 years old, from Haimen), and Chen Meifang (female, 22 years old, from Haimen), totaling thirty men and women arrested. Except for Shi Nianqing, Huang Jiuchu, Wu Zufang, and Chen Meifang, who were detained at the Public Security Bureau pending a formal request for their transfer, the remaining suspects, along with the kidnapped child, were taken back to the police station. The kidnapped child was escorted home, and the suspects were placed in separate cells. After investigation, it was found that Zhao Taotao had committed a crime endangering the Republic of China in 1930, for which he was sentenced to seven years in prison by the First Special Court, later reduced to five years after appeal. Dong Aqing committed a kidnapping in the Public Concession in 1930 and was sentenced to six years by the First Special Court. Chen Jinsheng committed extortion in the French Concession in 1929 and was sentenced to two years. Hu Youhua, Xu Weimin, Wang Jinxiang, and others had also committed crimes in the past. Yesterday, the police sent Zhao and the other twenty-six suspects to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo, accompanied by clerk Gao Yan, presided over the trial. After questioning the suspects about their age, residence, and address, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, outlined the case, stating that the defendants had been arrested for kidnapping and extortion, and the number of people arrested was very large. He requested a longer period for the police to conduct a detailed investigation and then file a suit for trial, asking that the defendants be temporarily detained. Detective Zhou Buguang then reported on the arrest process, stating that after arresting Yao, Dong, and Chen, Yao confessed that the kidnapping was instigated by the plaintiff Li Guanlin's brother-in-law, Chen Er'a, aka Chen Yongxiang. Chen was then arrested. It was later found that Chen had eloped with the plaintiff's sister and had not been in contact with them. However, on May 13, after the plaintiff's son was kidnapped, Chen Er'a came to the plaintiff's house on the 15th to inquire about the news, offering to help search for the child, and taking 250 yuan from the plaintiff. He also hired Yang, a lawyer from Baker Road, to write to the police station, requesting the withdrawal of the detectives stationed in the plaintiff's house. Because the police refused, this clue was obtained, leading to the solving of the case. At this point, the court ordered the defendants to be taken down and questioned separately. Yao Taotao was first questioned and initially denied involvement. After repeated questioning, he claimed that on May 5 or 6, a man named Su and Fang Dairang said that there was a man named Chen who had a son with each of his wives and was fighting over property. The first wife wanted to kill the second wife's son and asked to borrow a house to temporarily hide the child. He overheard this conversation. Now that he had been arrested, Detective Chang asked him about the child's whereabouts, and he replied with what Su and Fang had said before. Later, the detectives took him to Fang Dairang's place, and together with Fang, they retrieved the child, who they said was the child in question. However, he did not know who had kidnapped the child. He had returned to Zhenjiang because his wife had died and had only arrived in Shanghai yesterday after receiving a letter from a man named Wang who had helped him find work. Dong Aqing and Chen Jinsheng were then brought in for questioning, but they both denied participating in the kidnapping, claiming that they had only confessed under torture at the Public Security Bureau. Chen Er'a claimed that he was not the mastermind behind the kidnapping and that the child was his nephew, so how could he do such a thing? At this point, Detective Zhou Buguang stated to the court that Yang Hongde, who was guarding the child, had been sent by Chen Er'a and had now been arrested. He requested that Chen be confronted with this evidence. However, Chen still stubbornly denied the accusation, answering questions evasively. Su Zhaogen claimed that he farmed in Jiangxinsha and that Fang Dairang and a large woman had brought the child to him, saying that the child was being temporarily hidden for ten days or so due to a lawsuit between the first and second wives, and that he knew nothing about the kidnapping. Yang Hongde claimed that Chen Er'a had asked him to take care of the child. On the seventeenth day of the fourth lunar month, a man named Sha A'er introduced him to Chen Er'a at a small teahouse near Yangshupu Bridge. Chen Er'a told him that the first and second wives were fighting a lawsuit and that the first wife wanted to kill the second wife's son, asking him to take care of the child, promising to pay him half a yuan per day and provide him with food. He did not know Chen Er'a before. The court ordered Chen Er'a to be confronted with Yang Hongde, but Chen continued to deny everything, claiming that someone was trying to frame him. Fang Dairang claimed that Su Zhaogen was his friend and that a man named Sha and a female barber had come to him saying that the first wife wanted to kill the second wife's son due to a lawsuit between the first and second wives, asking him to borrow a house in the countryside to temporarily hide the child, far away so that it would not be found. He agreed, and a woman named Chen brought the child to him, claiming to be the second wife. On May 18, he handed the child over to Su, not knowing anything about the kidnapping. The court then questioned each of the other suspects one by one, but they all claimed to be unrelated to the case. The court reviewed the evidence and decided to postpone the trial to July 6. The defendants were remanded in custody. The court also instructed the police to release any defendants who were found to be unrelated to the case to avoid detaining innocent people. The court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Secret Drug Manufacturing Operation Inside Fengchang Rice Store: Wang Baosheng Sentenced to Five Years and Fined One Thousand Yuan, Cao Qi and Others Also Sentenced, Drugs Confiscated <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>A secret drug manufacturing operation was discovered inside the Fengchang Rice Store on Tiantong Road, producing morphine and other potent drugs. Taking advantage of the opportunity to transport rice, the drugs were placed in hemp bags and delivered to various buyers. This secret operation was originally difficult to expose. However, after a long period of time, the Xinza Police Station became aware of it and sent detectives to conduct a thorough investigation. Finally, on the morning of the 28th of last month, they intercepted a drug delivery suspect on Xizang Road and immediately went to search the rice store. They seized potent drugs and manufacturing equipment on the spot, and successively arrested the suspects Wang Baosheng and thirteen others, handing them over to the First Special District Local Court for investigation. The details have been previously reported. The investigating detectives escorted all the suspects to the court, and the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu also appeared in court. Judge Yang Zhaoqi then took his seat in the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought before the court, asking their names, ages, and origins one by one. He then announced the verdict: Wang Baosheng was sentenced to five years in prison and fined one thousand yuan; Cao Qi was sentenced to one year and six months in prison and fined one thousand yuan; Li Jiqin, Ye Defang, and Huang Tiancheng were each sentenced to one year and two months in prison; Jiang Jinda and Lu Yongsen were each sentenced to one year in prison; Zeng Jialian, Qiao Bosheng, Wang Linkui, Wang Junkui, Fu Genlou, and Wang Lansheng were all found not guilty; the drugs and other items were confiscated. After the judgment, the detectives took the criminals back to the police station pending confirmation and enforcement according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Sheng Yuchang is Accused of Abandonment, Appeal Heard, Lin Yujin Dissatisfied with Sheng's Suspended Sentence, Sheng Also Appealed, Demanding Dismissal <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>—The Plaintiff Believes the Appellant's Evidence is Suspicious—</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, 39, grandson of Sheng Xuanhuai, former Minister of Posts and Communications and Railway Minister of the Qing Dynasty, residing in a Western-style house at No. 1, Avenue Petain, French Concession, was previously sued by his concubine, Lin Yujin, a Guangdong woman (28), through a lawyer in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for abandonment. The trial resulted in Sheng being sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for one year. Sheng was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The plaintiff, Lin Yujin, was also dissatisfied with Sheng's suspended sentence and simultaneously filed an appeal, requesting the suspension be revoked and the sentence carried out. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The case has been approved by the High Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Guo Dechang, together with Judges Fan Peien and Wang Cheng, and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, specially convened the Third Criminal Court to hear the case. Lin Yujin was represented by her agents, Hua Maosheng, Huang Zengjie, and Zhu Zhengshan, due to illness. The appellant Sheng Yuchang, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court. First, the lawyers representing the appellant Lin Yujin stated that Lin Yujin was suffering from severe heart and lung diseases and was currently being treated in the hospital, so she could not appear in court. Lin had previously married the defendant as a concubine, but was later forced to leave. Lin then worked as a dancer in Shanghai. After the January 28th Incident, the defendant met Lin at a dance hall, and they rekindled their old feelings. They then rented the front building at No. 291 Renheli, Avenue Joffre, and lived together, promising to move back to the main residence. Later, the defendant suddenly stopped visiting due to Lin Yujin's lung disease. This situation constituted abandonment. The initial judgment of a suspended sentence was inappropriate, so she filed an appeal, requesting a change in the judgment. Sheng Yuchang testified that he married Lin Yujin, a Guangdong singer, as a concubine in January 1924. Later, she voluntarily and unconditionally left him. The judge asked if they had met again at a dance hall in Shanghai, and he replied no. He had stayed at home during the January 28th Incident and had not gone out. The judge asked if there had been any relationship afterward, and he replied no. At this point, his representative lawyer stated that they had found a telephone directory listing Huang Tiyu, the owner of a shoe repair shop at No. 291 Avenue Joffre, who could prove that Sheng Yuchang had never visited Lin Yujin. This would prove that Lin had been living with another lover. Huang was present and could be summoned for questioning. The judge ordered Huang to be brought before the court. Huang testified that he had rented the storefront at No. 291 Avenue Joffre in February 1932 and opened a shoe repair shop. Lin Yujin and her husband, surnamed Tan, lived upstairs. Tan was present and listening to the trial. The judge ordered him to be identified. Huang turned his head and pointed to the person sitting in the second row at the end of the audience, answering that it was him. The judge ordered the bailiff to bring Tan before the court. Tan testified that his name was Tan Fumin, and he lived on the third floor of No. 291 Avenue Joffre and had no cohabiting relationship with Lin Yujin. The judge then ordered the lawyers from both sides to begin their arguments. First, Lin's representative lawyer argued that the initial judgment of six months imprisonment, suspended, was because the defendant had never received a criminal sentence. However, this was not the case. Sheng Yuchang had previously been involved in litigation through lawyers over his concubines, and there was a record. The defendant himself claimed to have four or five concubines, showing that he relied on wealth and power, treating women as playthings. This behavior should be severely punished. As for the witness the defendant invited today, there was clear collusion. If the defendant had never been to No. 291 Avenue Joffre, how could he know there was a shoe repair shop? If he knew about the shoe repair shop, how could he know the owner's name? Telephone directories only list the shop name. Not only was Huang Tiyu present to testify, but Tan was also identified as Lin's lover. This matter was clearly collusive and should be investigated.

According to reports, the equipment room has been completed, and equipment is being actively installed. It is determined that broadcasting will begin before the 30th of next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Equipment Room Completed: After the Municipal Public Works Bureau took charge, it entrusted the construction of the radio station's equipment room, antenna base, and sheet piles to the Zhulunji Construction Company. The equipment room has now been completed. It is located behind the municipal government building and is divided into three rooms: a communications room, an equipment room, and a mechanic's room.

<p>Over Four Thousand Red Pills Found, Two More Suspects Arrested and Sent to the Bureau for Handling</p>
<p>Yang Ziqing, residing at No. 1 Shiping Lane, Zhuhang Lane, Nanshi, is unemployed and makes a living by selling red pill drugs. Recently, Yang used children from neighboring families and relatives to carry red pills to various ports, from where they were taken to various parts of the interior for sale, generating considerable profits. At around 5:00 PM the night before last, Yang again sent his nephew, a boy named Ma Xiaolin from Haimen, and a girl named Song Xiulang from Chongming, residing at No. 124 Shengyi Lane, Shengyi Wharf, Nanshi, to transport red pills hidden on their bodies to the Hongda steamer at Pier 9 (Datong Wharf), intending to hand them over. However, their plan was discovered by Dong Mingde, captain of the Sixteenth Bund Detective Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who sent detectives Zhang Zhongliang, Yuan Mingcai, Fu Sanbao, and Li Fatong to the vicinity of Pier 9 (Datong Wharf). They noticed two children, a boy and a girl, around ten years old, looking nervous and suspicious, and decided to check them. They found five packs of red pills, each containing five hundred pills, totaling two thousand five hundred pills, hidden on the boy's body. They also found two thousand red pills in a pocket bag around the girl's waist. The two children and the four thousand five hundred red pills were taken back to the squad for questioning. The boy confessed that his name was Ma Xiaolin, 14 years old, from Haimen, who came to Shanghai last year and resided with his maternal grandmother's family on Dapu Road. He currently lived with his maternal uncle Yang Ziqing at No. 1 Shiping Lane, Zhuhang Wharf, Nanshi. The red pills had been given to him yesterday by his maternal uncle at Yang's house, instructing him (Ma himself claimed) to bring them to the Hongda steamer at Datong Wharf this afternoon to be received by his maternal uncle Yang Ziqing. The girl confessed that her name was Song Xiulang, from Chongming, 11 years old, residing at No. 124 Shengyi Lane, Yisheng Wharf, Nanshi. Yang Ziqing had instructed her to hide four packs of red pills in her pocket bag, wrap it around her waist, and wear a floral cloth cheongsam over it to transport them to the Hongda steamer at Datong Wharf, promising to pay her one yuan as a reward, which had not yet been paid. She had delivered them once six or seven days ago, and Yang had given her one yuan to give to her mother. Yang, being well-informed, had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Yang's wife, Jiang, was arrested. In the front厢房, a package of red pills totaling five hundred pills was found in the bottom of the interlayer of a round 洋 iron box. The members of the unit then went to No. 124 Yisheng Lane and arrested Song Lushi (64 years old), a related person. In total, there were four people. After the Huang Branch Chief transmitted the case for interrogation, it was sent to the General Bureau for legal action this afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Recent Developments in the Meifeng Liquidation <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Difficulty in Collecting Debts, According to the North-China Daily News, Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of Meifeng Bank, stated to a news reporter yesterday that the loans and overdrafts of Meifeng Bank totaled approximately 7 million yuan, of which only about 1.5% has been recovered to date. The lack of understanding of the liquidator by the debtors is regrettable. Since taking office as liquidator, he has repeatedly urged the repayment of debts by letters and telephone calls. Some people have responded, saying that they have no cash available but would pay a certain amount first, with the remainder to be paid in one week, one month, or even longer. This kind of behavior is commendable. However, the majority of people have simply ignored the calls, neither responding by letter nor sending someone to discuss the matter, and not even making a telephone call. Therefore, it is planned to resort to legal action from the beginning of next week to collect the debts as soon as possible. If the matter is delayed for a long time, even the salaries of the employees may not be fully paid. Currently, the company employs 35 people to handle the liquidation work, which is heavy, and the salaries are very low. It is difficult to predict when the liquidation will be completed. Someone called to ask if the money they had deposited in the bank could be recovered, or when they could withdraw it. He was told that it was not possible at the moment, and it was doubtful whether it would be possible in eight months. Even then, he could not guarantee that the full amount could be recovered. In the two weeks from the bank's closure to June 18, a total of 89,782.8 yuan was received. Including the cash stored on the day of the closure, 13,527.7 yuan, the total cash on hand is now 103,309.5 yuan. At that time, there was a total of 17,541.19 yuan in cash on the books, including 4,000 yuan in Meifeng Bank notes, which had long become worthless paper but was still stored in the vault and recorded as cash. This amount must be deducted. The amount owed to the Meidong 銀 Company is 178,749.5 yuan, of which only 4,186.92 yuan has been recovered in two weeks. The position of the Puyi 銀 Company is even worse. The amount owed is 216,902.82 yuan, of which only 2,000 yuan has been recovered in two weeks.</p>

<p>Huafu Malt Milk Essence is a necessity for quitting smoking. Since the National Government has resolved to ban smoking, all citizens have unanimously supported it. The number of people who quit has also increased greatly, but to this day there are still a few who are reluctant to give up. One is that they are concerned that there is no good way to quit, and the other is that the beneficiaries often experience adverse phenomena such as dizziness, headaches, and bone pain after quitting, which leads to repeated offenses. However, if you take Huafu Malt Milk Essence, you can avoid this kind of pain forever, because it contains a rich source of lecithin, which has a clever effect of overcoming smoking, and its effect of strengthening the brain, nourishing the body, and increasing blood is far greater than other nourishing products. It is truly a necessary product for those who want to quit smoking today. This product is exclusively managed by Ruishang Xinruikang Foreign Company at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. It is sold in major companies, pharmacies, and foreign wine and food stores in this city and other ports.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I read in your newspaper yesterday the first item of the basic meeting discussion of the Sugar, North and South Sundries Association, that Zheng Tongyong beat Zhang Zuwang in violation of market rules, and the market decided to fine him 25 yuan and a pair of candles, and ordered Zheng Tongyuan to come to the market within three days to comply. I was very surprised to read this. Tongyuan attended the executive and supervisory meeting of the Southern Goods Association on the 28th of last month. Zhang Zuwang suddenly broke into the market and wandered for a long time, and arbitrarily shouted in his mouth, which caused opposition from the crowd. After persuading him to withdraw, he became angry and reported to the Sugar Industry Association and fabricated a fake injury report, deceptively suing the local court. The court session was held on the 18th of this month, and the forensic doctor proved in court that there were no scars. The verdict is now scheduled to be announced on the 24th of this month. The Sugar, North and South Sundries Market believed in one-sided remarks, did not investigate the facts, and illegally punished Tongyuan, which Tongyuan finds difficult to accept. In addition to submitting a request to the Party and government authorities for thorough investigation, I am deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth and cause misunderstandings. I hereby write to correct this. To the editor of Shenbao Newspaper, Zheng Tongyuan respectfully. June 21, 1935.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I read in your newspaper on June 18 a news item about a young woman throwing herself into the river from a ferry, which stated that before the deceased woman threw herself into the river from the Taikoo Company's Quick and Large No. 1 launch, she handed a paper bag to another man, who reported to the water police station that his name was Wang Liansheng and that he was a waiter at the Zhongnan Hotel in this city. However, there is absolutely no such person as Wang Liansheng in our shop's waiters. It turns out that Wang Liansheng was a servant of a Mr. Shen who opened a long-term room in our shop last year, and has nothing to do with our shop. I don't know why he pretended to be a waiter in our shop. I hope your newspaper will correct this to clarify the facts and avoid misunderstandings. Zhongnan Hotel respectfully. June 21.</p>

<p>Buzzing mosquitoes, everyone hates them! But there are some people who rely on them to live, and maybe even make some money from them. If you don't believe me? Then look at the many factories on the market that manufacture and sell large quantities of mosquito incense sticks. Isn't this a powerful piece of evidence!</p>
<p>The sun's heat is increasing the degrees on the thermometer day by day! The city girls are reducing the clothes on their bodies day by day, wearing only thin cicada-wing gauze shirts, and strolling leisurely on the streets with their bare white legs, but if you look closely, there seem to be faint frostbite scars! But the girls in the countryside are also baring their legs, because they have been tanned by the sun, and you can't even see if there are any frostbite scars! They are working hard in the fields.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Calligrapher Mei Tiaoding <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Country Old Man</p>
<p>In the early years of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty, in the era when scholars were obsessed with the imperial examinations, those scholars who were repeatedly unsuccessful in the thorny examinations often set up schools to teach and make a living by training children. Among them, there were many talented people who were buried in poor alleys and small houses, forming poetry societies and studying ancient texts to pass the boring years. There were also many people who used calligraphy and painting to relieve their boredom.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Youzhu Tiaoding of our county was of noble character and his calligraphy was famous throughout the country. He was poor and made a living by setting up schools. There were no servants at home. When a friend came to his house, the wooden door was closed and self-opened. He often saw Mr. Dao Mao standing proudly, hanging his wrist to write couplets, and his calligraphy was like a god. Some people wondered why the wooden door was self-opened. After a long time, they realized that Mr. Mei had a daughter who was beautiful and intelligent, skilled in poetry and calligraphy. Whenever she heard the sound of pecking, she would get up and open the door, and then hide behind the door to let the guests in.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei was energetic, clear and elegant, and easy-going. He liked to play with children. When I was six or seven years old, Mr. Mei had a very close relationship with my uncle and grandfather. When he came to my house, he would always hold me and ask me to write. Later, I remembered my late grandmother saying: Whenever Mr. Mei wrote screen couplets, he would always ask my aunt to hold the paper, because my aunt also knew how to write. Mr. Mei liked to eat tea eggs, and he would not be full without eating more than a dozen of them. He also liked to eat glutinous rice. After eating, he would say and walk, "I can fly! I can fly!" And his calligraphy was even better at this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei was poor. Every year when the end of the year came, he would come to Shanghai. Wealthy merchants and officials, those who heard of his name, would ask him to write. Mr. Mei sometimes agreed and sometimes did not. Someone gave him a fur coat, and he pretended to ask Mr. Mei to try it on, and laughed and said: This coat fits Mr. Mei's figure very well. Mr. Mei does not need to buy another one, so as to avoid the incompatibility of the axe handle. Mr. Mei smiled and accepted it. After Mr. Mei returned, the money from selling his calligraphy came in steadily, and Mr. Mei passed the end of the year safely.</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Mei passed by the Fourth Horse Road and saw women in white powder and black eyebrows coming and going on the road. Mr. Mei shouted loudly in the crowd of women: "Niang Niang! Niang Niang!" (Ningbo dialect: Let me pass!) Those who heard it laughed.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's calligraphy is rarely passed down to this day. Those who get a small piece of silk or paper treasure it like a treasure. In the recent hundred years, there is no calligrapher in the country who can surpass him.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Wooden Fish <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yide</p>
<p>In today's society, the most beloved literature of old-fashioned women remains "Drum Lyrics" and "Stringed Ballads," because refined and beautiful literature fails to interest them. Only "Drum Lyrics" and "Stringed Ballads" can move their heartstrings, causing these women to unconsciously shed countless tears.</p>
<p>However, the "Stringed Ballads" favored by Guangdong women are not quite the same as the common ones. They have created a separate term for them called "Wooden Fish." The difference with "Wooden Fish" is that they are not as long as Stringed Ballads, nor do they have as many elaborate, conversational asides. To give a precise analogy, Stringed Ballads are like long, episodic novels, while Wooden Fish are like short literary essays. Although Wooden Fish also contain purely rational or lyrical passages, this is only a small part. The majority still resembles a story poem in form.</p>
<p>Wherever you go, as long as you are within the boundaries of Guangzhou, you can hear old-fashioned women singing these tunes while working or chatting. If you meet an acquaintance who is an old-fashioned woman, and you ask her, "Can you sing Wooden Fish?" then she will likely answer you, "I can, but I don't sing very well." As a result, she will sing you the popular Wooden Fish about Xue Mei sacrificing at the grave: "My husband has died, and my tears have not yet dried; the Qingming Festival is near, adding more sorrow; I prepare paper money to burn at the graveside, lest this mountain valley be neglected..."</p>
<p>The Wooden Fish they sing does not have a fixed rhythm or pitch. It goes up and down along with the tones of the words. Sometimes when they sing with great emotion, in the sad and melancholic places, they release the emotions that have accumulated deep in their hearts, along with the melody, sobbing and weeping.</p>
<p>The lyrics in Wooden Fish are mostly composed in the Guangdong dialect and are spoken from a woman's perspective. The content of the lyrics also tends to lean toward the mournful and tragic. The lyrics are so sad and unbearable to hear that when you listen to them sing Wooden Fish, the sorrow in your heart is already evident in your expression.</p>

<p>— Mu Liang</p>
<p>The city's night is not as silent and simple as the countryside. Splendid and colorful neon lights, stained with what seems like blood, hide on shop signs or corners, blinking their eyes. Dashing through the shadows are the insane machines of the new century: such as the 1934 model "Studebaker," "Black Puma Skin," the 1935 models "Chrysler," "Plymouth," and so on... meandering long queues like a formation driving smoothly on the smooth, flat asphalt toward the magnificent Volcano, again and again… interlacing.</p>
<p>The Western-style uniformed "small attendants" open the glass doors of "Chrome" and let the enchanting Lucia girls, holding the hands of gentlemen, walk in. They step on the marble granite floor, their footsteps light, one group, another group, packing the place to the brim.</p>
<p>The bandstand begins to unleash the melody of music, and these couples from beyond the century slowly glide along the smooth floor, following the music. Dancing, kissing, embracing tightly, the intoxicating, moving beauty, is enjoyed and admired by the gentlemen.</p>
<p>During the break, bangs sound from the east, bangs sound from the west, the air of Volcano is filled with tense emotion—the caps of beer and champagne flying wildly.</p>
<p>The Lucia girls and the gentlemen raise their champagne glasses together, the grape wine inside, intoxicated by laughter and lascivious poses!</p>
<p>The bandstand unleashes the melody of music twenty-some times, and everyone's feet slowly glide along the smooth floor.</p>
<p>As soon as closing time arrives, the new-century machines become lively again on the asphalt. Some Lucia girls, however, follow the gentlemen to make pink dreams.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bustling and noisy Volcano finally becomes silent!</p>

<p>— Originally by Princess Deling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 29: Imperial Physician</p>
<p>We stayed on the lake, and no one felt bored, almost until five or six o'clock in the afternoon, when it was getting dark before we stopped. Therefore, I seized the opportunity to ask the Empress Dowager what she meant by the "mischievous imp of fate" that she mentioned earlier. She already knew that I was someone who loved to ask questions, and she herself was someone who loved to explain everything to people. So, her reply came out with a smile without any hesitation.</p>
<p>"Strictly speaking, this is just a very peculiar belief! This belief is that people must not be too happy. If you are too happy, there will be a figure similar to a deity in the dark, who will suddenly descend upon you when you are least prepared, and cause you all kinds of unhappiness. It can also be said that an event that makes people feel unhappy is a kind of duty that this deity must fulfill. Because if it were not manipulating things, people would wantonly enjoy themselves, and would not know what pain and suffering are like. So, it is working all year round. If you already feel very comfortable and at ease, the mischievous imp of fate will come and make you feel uneasy and uncomfortable right away; or, if you are strutting and full of high spirits, it will come and make your happiness disappear into thin air. Its stomach is simply full of materials for playing pranks on people. No matter what the matter, while it is proceeding smoothly and steadily, it cannot avoid being disrupted by it a few times. Therefore, there is no truly smooth and steady thing in the world." (346)</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Sincere Words and Earnest Advice, Pounding the Table Out of Injustice; the Allure of Money and Lights, Pitifully Selling a Person</p>
<p>The last sentence, his voice was very loud, you could tell that he had made a great determination. When Bei Hai heard this, he clenched his teeth tightly. The newspaper held in both hands tore apart with a "嗤" sound. This was a newspaper provided by the hotel, so he had to put it down and find a waiter to say that he was willing to pay for the loss. Since he said so, the waiter naturally found it inconvenient to ask him for compensation, saying that it was worthless, and that was the end of it. But in the time it took to say these few words, when Bei Hai looked back, both women had left. He guessed that Mrs. Hu must have gone home to discuss Yue Ying's price. Although he and Yue Ying didn't have any friendship, in terms of human feelings, he felt that such a good girl was ultimately selling herself, which was really unbearable. As for the illusion that had formed in his mind these past few days, it had finally quickly become an illusion, which goes without saying. He couldn't bear this matter in his heart, so without thinking, he rushed straight to Cheng Zhiqian's room. Zhiqian was also reading a book. Seeing him rushing in angrily, he looked at him with the book in his hand, somewhat stunned. Bei Hai stopped at the door, his face red, and said: Mr. Cheng, I think this matter is too outrageous! Zhiqian's face also turned red, and he stood up and said: Why are you yelling at me, saying it's outrageous? I asked you to come for tutoring, I had no ill intentions. Moreover, whether you come or not is up to you, how can you say such a thing to me. As he said that, he slammed the book in his hand on the table. Bei Hai paused for a moment, then laughed: Ah! Mr. Cheng, you misunderstood. It's that in front of me, I saw something that I thought was too outrageous, so I came to report it to you. How could I not know what is good for me, how dare I offend Mr. Cheng. (246)</p>

<h3 id="e161">A Murdered Woman (Part 2) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— You Aimei</p>
<p>In the distant aftermath of the [marriage] disturbance, how did she fare? Alas! She was a weakling who had been shaped through much suffering, with no awareness or ability to resist! She could only weep in secret!</p>
<p>She married in the autumn of that year. I remember when my father returned from her home on the day she returned to her parents' home, he sighed to my mother, "Alas! That child Qingzhang, she is so honest and pitiful!" I interjected and asked my father, "What does this mean?" Only then did I learn that on the second night after her marriage, her husband flattered her by taking out the photo that his former lover had given him and tearing it up in front of her. Moreover, he repented to her and said, "If our marriage had been a little earlier, I would not have had that previous misstep." When she returned to her parents' home, she secretly told her mother all these things, seeming very satisfied in her heart. Alas! How could she know that this is called forgetting the old when you get the new, and that this kind of person is the most unreliable? My father had deep experience, so he sighed like that!</p>
<p>Over the next two or three years, my family situation deteriorated. The winter before last, my father also passed away. The burden of life weighed on my shoulders, and I spent the whole year running around outside, trying to make a living. Therefore, I wasn't very clear about her situation. Last year, worried about the weather, I lost my job and went home. Coincidentally, she was also in the city, staying at her parents' home. At this time, she was already pregnant. Once, when I saw her, she suddenly said to me: she wanted to send something to my house, to see my mother. I went back and told my mother, and my mother also planned to ask her to come over for a chat. However, after she got married, she had never been to my house before. According to custom, we had to prepare a full banquet to treat her, and we couldn't just let her eat a regular meal. But my finances were in a panic. I had to tell her: "The weather is too hot, wait until it's cooler, and then I'll pick you up to play." But in just a few days, she had already returned to the countryside. Who knew that this parting would be our final farewell? In the autumn, I heard that she had given birth to a boy, but I also heard that her husband had changed his mind and often abused her. Although I couldn't help but feel sorry for her, I didn't expect that in this short half a year, her husband's attitude toward her would get worse and worse, and as a result, he would beat her until her body was covered in injuries! Logically, there are many concrete ways to deal with such a situation. However, how could someone with her personality and will, like her, think of or do those things? What's more, her parents' family was stubborn, and the realistic society was feudal. Their position was also under the leadership of old ethical teachings. How could they allow her to? If not, why wait until today? When the disturbance started before her marriage, they wouldn't have blindly pushed her into the pit of fire! So, she could only grieve for her short life, and lightly end her youth of only twenty-three years with a three-foot white silk.</p>
<p>Alas! The dead are gone! What else can be said! What is especially painful is that I look out at my hometown, where there are still many pitiful women, who are weaklings with the same illness as her, who are also succumbing to the control of old ethical teachings, enduring the sanctions of feudal society, and grieving in the shadows, waiting for them to be murdered!</p>
<p>Appendix: After I finished writing this article, I still have lingering sorrow, and my feelings are still uncontrollable. I cry for her with a couplet, which is also attached below.</p>
<p>The old events are too painful to mention again.  We used to play together as children. When she came of age, I taught her how to write. My feelings for her were like that of a sibling. How could I bear the bad news from afar?</p>
<p>Meeting a person who was not good for her was tragic. Three feet of white silk. A mound of yellow earth. I pity my sister who died with her eyes closed. Who will complain of her grievances in the underworld?</p>

<p>—Another Increase of Six Yuan and Eight Cents from the Previous Day—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market suddenly became attractive due to rumors of China purchasing silver with Huaguo bills, but after the closing of the large silver trading session, silver plunged sharply, leading to a surge in buying interest in the market. The momentum was quite strong. In the early morning, foreign banks rose, the British pound remained flat, and there was news of sellers emerging after the closing of the large silver trading session below 0.625. The Mondli Group's silver price rose by one and a half percent, and the exchange rate fluctuated favorably. London's raw gold rose by two U.S. dollars, and people continued to anticipate price increases. The off-market pre-market trading opened and rose again to 73.4 yuan, and soon rose to over 4 yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices revealed that both British and American currencies increased, and the customs gold unit rose by 2%. The standard price for gold bids was listed as 837.53 yuan, with little impact. The market hovered around 4 yuan. After the opening, it rose once, but because banks sold off, the foreign exchange market temporarily weakened. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) strongly sold shillings, and the process of exchanging to U.S. dollars hardened, and the selling momentum turned around. The listed prices announced by HSBC revealed that both British and American currencies remained flat, with no impact. The market declined temporarily, but people's confidence remained. There were quite a few sellers at low prices, which provided support. Although banks still had both buying and selling, there were more sales than purchases. Later, the market heard rumors that the Central Bank would return over 3,000 bars of cash for export on July 3rd, triggering a buying spree, and the short sellers became panicked again, and prices gradually rose, with a strong trend. The Central Bank continued to sell shillings, and sellers took advantage of the high prices to trade, and prices dropped slightly. Later, people's confidence became stronger, and the market opened firmly. Silver was quoted at 16 annas, and local prices were extremely weak. Buying interest was even stronger. Although the Central Bank blocked a large number of shillings, the buying momentum became more and more intense.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a sudden shift in the situation, with money houses absorbing large amounts and the financial sector continuing to engage in arbitrage. Under the dual pressure, the short positions were barely able to resist and began to cover their positions. Although there was a slight rebound later, the market sentiment remained volatile. With only one trading day left this month, there is bound to be a wave of fluctuations. Yesterday, the opening session in the morning saw the strongest gains, as the large-scale absorption by a certain bank threatened the short positions, leading to a flurry of short covering. Various bonds rose frequently, with the market generally continuing to rise by several jiao to one yuan. The second session saw the front-row issues rise, while the back-row issues rose less. In the afternoon sessions, the market price rebounded slightly due to the floating longs releasing profits, but the fluctuations remained inconsistent.

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. However, the sales of current yarn felt weak again. Because the price of foreign yarn is relatively high, Chinese yarn is being eroded by its sales. Therefore, Changfeng Hao threw out yarn every day, in a very large quantity. However, most colleagues bought in and went long because their base plate had dried up, and some turned from short to long, so the market rose again after falling.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Changfeng Again</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn forward market, the prices for each month all showed stagnation. Because most of the rumors from the previous day were completely unfounded, the market sentiment softened slightly, and Changfeng continued to throw out yarn. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 3, 6, 7, and 9 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market price was calm and the market was scattered. Because current yarn sales were still sluggish and the price of Japanese yarn softened, the market remained low until the third closing. Because cotton prices rose and rumors resurfaced, the market rebounded. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 1, 5, 6, and 7 jiao compared to the closing price of the morning session. The sales included 600 bales from Gengfeng, with a remaining balance of 550 bales from Changfeng, 900 bales from Renfeng, 1,700 bales from Changfa, 400 bales from Heyu, 700 bales from Yichang, 1,400 bales from Qinchang, and 350 bales from Runkang.

<p>The cotton market initially fell, then rose, and the situation was relatively tight, because some shorts turned to long, resulting in a tighter price. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the gold market rose and that a certain matter was being brought up again, so the market turned up. However, the current cotton mills are still weak.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Slightly Bullish</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton futures market, prices fell across the board because the rumors of the day were inaccurate, and many longs closed out their positions. The US cotton situation was also normal. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 2 jiao to 2.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market opened flat in the afternoon. Around the second and third sessions, the price of gold rose, and rumors circulated in the market, saying that the matter in question was being brought up again. As a result, the buying interest was more active. In fact, some shorts turned to long, resulting in a tighter surface. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 3.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the morning session. The sales included 1,700 dan from Yichang, 1,200 dan from Ruidai, 2,200 dan from Yuandai, 2,100 dan from Dafu, 1,500 dan from Dafeng, 1,400 dan from Saifeng, 4,300 dan from Qinchang, 1,200 dan from Xiecheng, 2,300 dan from Shengyuan, 1,200 dan from Yongdai, 1,200 dan from Yikang, 2,600 dan from Changhe, and 1,100 dan from Yuanxingchang.

<p>The flour market is generally stable, as Chicago foreign wheat is good for about 12 points, and Canadian wheat is good for 8 points. Although market transactions are quiet, all major and minor factories are sticking to their prices and not selling off. According to various customers, most have reduced large-scale operations due to credit issues. However, with fewer shipments, market sentiment has improved slightly. In the afternoon sessions, transactions remained quiet, with floating longs selling out recent contracts, and asking prices were slightly weak. However, factories were not selling distant contracts, and prices remained stable. Since the inferior value of the new wheat season, transactions have declined. With the financial sector not active, both sides can only wait for changes. As a result, the price for this month was unchanged, July was good for 2.5%, August was slightly lower by 2.5%, September was unchanged, October was good for 1.5%, and November was good for 7.5%.</p>
<p>The wheat market sentiment is still hidden, and opening prices are up 12 points from the previous day. However, the situation for both sides is particularly dull. The mainland gang's hedging is watching and waiting due to credit and transfer issues. The central location is originally a convergence point for commerce from all over, but today's gloom is intensifying, and future development is feared to be difficult. In the afternoon sessions, the market was initially stable, but then short-term contracts gradually fell as longs closed out their positions. As a result, there were some movements in July and August, September fell by 2 points, and October fell by 3 points. The current wheat market is also sluggish, with factories saying they are not greedy and shipments are still smooth. Secondary wheat is also down 12 points. The opening price for Yangzhou Zhenjiang Anting wheat is 3.35 yuan, the high-quality Hankou wheat is 3.36 yuan, the Jiangxinzhou wheat is 3.39 yuan (secondary 7%), the Hure wheat is 3.367 yuan, the Danyang wheat is 3.34 yuan, the Taicang wheat is 3.312 yuan, and the Kunshan wheat is 3.37 yuan (secondary to 2.5 jiao). Shuangfeng wheat is 3.31 yuan, and Penglai wheat is 3.34 yuan (secondary to 2.6 jiao). Fuxin shipped 5,500 bags, Fufeng shipped 1,100 bags, and Shenda and Xinda each shipped 500 bags.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat is pouring in, so factory markets have improved, but prices are feared to be difficult to rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sources for domestic rice (Shanghai South) only arrived from the 16th and 17th (a total of more than 3,000 Shi), but with cloudy weather, market sentiment was poor, and sales were sluggish. The price of various Japonica rice fell by 2 jiao, and the price of various Indica rice fell by slightly more than a jiao because some Qingdao brought about 300 bags in packages. The variable yuan was also low - 1 Chi, and the Yin yuan had no market. (Shanghai North) The source of Longlu was on the 12th, and the goods went out. White Japonica rice, those with short prices, sold slightly better, while thin Indica and early Japonica rice sales remained flat. Market prices for white Japonica, thin Indica, and early Japonica rice were down 12 jiao, while white rice arrivals were low and sales were sluggish, with prices down nearly a jiao. The prices of other goods also showed weakness.</p>
<p>The appetite for foreign rice was weak in both the morning and afternoon, continuing the weak trend from the previous day. Buyers were releasing. The inland area had continuous heavy rain, and the price of rushing to load and transport goods was not as high as before. There was not much entertainment on the street, and the Yangtze River area was not continuing the supply. Market prices immediately continued to fall by 56%. In the afternoon, it was reported that the selling price in the production area had rebounded, and the price of ordered goods had increased by nearly a jiao. Market sentiment stabilized accordingly, and goods owners were not in a hurry to sell. The total transaction volume for various foreign rice was 5,400 bags, with two contributing parties - one-half of which was distributed to the mainland and the street.</p>

<p>Yesterday's situation for soybean oil cake was active, as the news reported that soybean sales were more active in Lianning. Soybean cake factories released and recovered lower-period cakes for June in the market, causing market sentiment to tighten. The current cake sales market was also active, and the internal market sentiment also showed improvement. According to statistics, more than 1,000 pieces of various soybean oils were opened in the city, and market prices rose by 23 jiao. More than 1,000 pieces of peanut oil were traded, and market prices were unchanged. The soybean cake family in Yuanning, which recovered, accounted for about 15,000 to 16,000 pieces of Xingdao's nearly divided yellow soybeans. There were diseases and courts, and the Tongzhou took the Yuanfang, etc., and a total of three to six carts of various soybeans were traded, and market prices rose by 45 points. For various market prices, please read the market instrument.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's information from Chao Mo's oil head, although the exchange rate has rebounded by 5 yuan, it is still not low, so the dividing price should be higher than before. The recent market, such as Zhengjian Fenzi Jingban's price, is 16.8 yuan, Gongbai is 10.56 yuan, Fenbai is 13.34 yuan, foreign white is 2.12 yuan higher, upper red is 1.8 yuan, Tongyi is also 9.9 yuan, upper Ti is 9.8 yuan, Yangqing is 9.5 yuan, and Xishu is 9.81, which is good. Longqing is 8.9 yuan, and the others are slightly reduced. Based on the land price and the continuous momentum of nine theories, the question mark on this plate has a possibility of softening. As for this port's market, the trend is weak as always. The Guild's dividing price for spot No. 4 coarse sugar is 15.93 yuan, down another 1 point from the previous day. The transit goods were traded at 4.95 yuan, 500 yuan, and 4.50 to 4.60 yuan, but no transactions were made. The TaiKoo and Benjin white also opened up.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Introduction to the New Metal Vacuum Tube <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Pin</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes are climbing the ladder of evolution, improving layer by layer, and now their shape is completely different from that of their ancestors. Recently, General Electric Company of the United States has manufactured a metal vacuum tube that is smaller than the usual glass tube. It has a metal shell on the outside, which not only serves as a shielding cover, but also has several advantages, including strong structure, fast heat dissipation, reduced internal capacity, and economic cost.</p>
<p>It is said that ten different types of these vacuum tubes have now been created, including powerful rectifier tubes, triode output tubes, variable mu pentodes, pentagrid converters, and hexodes. The last one is composed of a small triode and a twin diode, with two cathodes and duo-plates, but its height (the height above the lamp waist) is only 1 1/2 inches.</p>
<p>The socket of this new vacuum tube is also more advanced than the previous socket. Regardless of the number of pins on the vacuum tube, it can be inserted into the same eight-pin socket, because the pin spacing is exactly the same and at a certain interval. In the center of the vacuum tube, there is a large pin with a key installed on it. If we want to insert the tube into the socket, we only need to insert the large pin into the large hole in the middle of the socket first, and then slowly rotate the vacuum tube until the key on the large pin falls into the corresponding slot, and then insert the vacuum tube. In this way, there is no need to recognize the thickness of the pins like ordinary vacuum tubes, so even in dark places, the vacuum tube can be inserted into the socket without making mistakes. In addition to the pins that should be present, there is one more pin, which is connected to the external shield, so the spring in the corresponding hole on the socket should be grounded.</p>
<p>Because these vacuum tubes do not have glass pillars inside, the structure is much simpler. Also, because the terminals of each electrode are led out from the bottom plate, the lead wires are short and strong, and the internal capacity is greatly reduced. As for its manufacturing method, it is different from the usual one. Here, we start from the bottom plate, and after each electrode is installed, the lead wires are led out from the bottom plate. Before the lead wires are led out, a small circle made of alloy is soldered into the holes in the bottom plate. This alloy is specially made to suit the needs here. Its name is Fernicc, made of iron, nickel, and cobalt. The expansion coefficient is the same as glass. The lead-out wire passes through a small glass bead, and then the glass bead is melted into the alloy ring.</p>
<p>The outer shell of the vacuum tube is made of 1/58 inch thick iron sheet and is used for shielding. Inside the outer shell, there is also a cylinder, which is equivalent to the glass cover of an ordinary vacuum tube. The joint between this cylinder and the bottom plate uses the principle of electric welding. A strong current of 20,000 amperes is passed through it for 1/4 second, and the cylinder around and the bottom plate are welded tightly. After welding, after the air exclusion procedure, the structure of the vacuum tube is almost complete. As for the air that is not completely removed from the tube, it cannot be treated according to the usual method using the high-frequency induction coil method. A strong gas flame should be used to burn it until it turns red.</p>
<p>The metal vacuum tubes mentioned above are not yet sold on the market, but it is said that these new products will be used in various full-wave radios operated by General Electric Company in the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Twelve-Pin Vacuum Tube <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>A German magazine, Funk-Technische Monatsliefte Magazine, talks about an exciting new product, which is a set of complex vacuum tubes with twelve pins manufactured by D.S. Loewe Co., Germany.</p>
<p>Such a vacuum tube has two characteristics: first, in addition to the original screen grid and filament in the vacuum tube, sometimes there are also resistors and other components connected inside. For example, in a grid-leak detection vacuum tube, the grid leak and grid fixed capacitor are already connected in the vacuum tube during manufacturing, making it particularly simple to be used in radios. Second, all vacuum tubes, regardless of their number, have twelve pins. For example, if a certain vacuum tube only needs nine pins, the remaining three pins are left unused. Therefore, any vacuum tube can be equipped with the same tube socket. (This point can be imitated when China manufactures its own vacuum tubes.) Also, there are three protrusions on the base of the vacuum tube to prevent it from being inserted incorrectly into the tube socket.</p>
<p>In addition to the filament being shared, each electrode of this type of complex vacuum tube is completely independent. When used, it is no different from two or three separate vacuum tubes. There are now four types that have been produced: A, radio frequency pentode and grid-leak detection tube (leakage and capacitor have been connected in the tube). B, radio frequency pentode and diode detection tube and screen grid tetrode. C, pentode mixer tube and triode oscillator tube and pentode intermediate frequency amplifier tube. D, radio frequency pentode and screen grid detection tube and pentode power amplifier tube. Among the above types, type C is specially for superheterodyne use, and type D can be widely used in radios with one vacuum tube and a loudspeaker.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Single-Tube AC/DC "Radio Phonograph Adapter" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>— New Application of 12A7 Compound Vacuum Tube —</p>
<p>In the 71st issue of this journal, there was an article by Mr. Ming Xiang, "Radio Phonograph Adapter". The function of this machine is actually a small-power transmitter. The author was also interested and imitated it. Due to parts, the oscillation tube used a DC 33, which had a good effect, but the power consumption was very large—</p>
<p>The one introduced here is made using only one new compound vacuum tube 127, which functions as both oscillation and rectification. According to the test, the results are similar to the previous two, but there are very few auxiliary equipment, and the power is taken from AC/DC, so it is convenient to use and easy to manage, which is most suitable for comrades who love economy.</p>
<p>The attached diagram is the circuit of this adapter. The entire machine is placed in a metal box and grounded to prevent the transmitted radio waves from interfering with nearby radios. The C voltage is obtained by dropping the voltage of the screen grid current and screen grid current through R. R uses a variable resistor, which is better as a regulator than a fixed one.</p>
<p>When using, connect the A and G terminals of this device to the antenna and ground terminals of the radio, respectively. Then connect the control grid and cathode of this device (as shown by the dotted line X in the figure), and adjust the radio to a silent place (a place without a radio station). Then adjust the variable capacitor C in this device. As soon as the X dotted line is removed and the pickup is connected, it is ok! (However, it should be noted that the pickup should use a high-impedance type, otherwise a transformer must be connected.) Applied parts.</p>

<p>— Yan Qingzhi</p>
<p>The Radio Friends Association meets once every winter to discuss technical issues and provide sufficient courses to professor demands. Most of the "Shortwave Department" report the results of their experiments and the achievements of their activities, and they publish "Amateur Short Notes" (Ham Sheet). This magazine is valued by amateurs. Q symbols and general amateur abbreviations are also written in Russian on it.</p>
<p>The most popular radio magazine with the largest number of readers is "Radio Front". This magazine is published twice a month and contains a shortwave column, which records words and letters of particular interest to amateurs. There are technical columns, as well as records of radio news and amateur radio stations, etc.</p>
<p>It is very common to install the equipment of members in clubs or organizations, because there is no cost for installing the equipment, so ordinary people who can live a normal life can set it up themselves. The money paid is government-circulated banknotes that have no exchange value externally, and domestic workers call it, "Haipa, Ruble". Therefore, important machines must use domestic products, and parts such as electric meters can also be manufactured by themselves. Amateurs use the things they make themselves.</p>
<p>There are many radio shops on the street that sell parts and various accessories. Many things are new, and many are very old.</p>
<p>Radios usually use regenerative detection. It is also common to see loudspeakers installed at the entrance of stores. Few people listen to the broadcast. Most of them are used for publicity, especially at large train stations. Radios are usually simple designs with two or three tubes. Regenerative detection and a one-stage low-frequency amplification two-tube machine is very common, and the three-tube machine usually adds a stage of tunable high-frequency amplification.</p>
<p>Transmitters also use very simple styles. There are also many amateurs who use crystal control. Most of the styles are grid-shelf or panel style. Transmitting vacuum tubes generally use 20 watts to 150 watts. Antennas generally use American-style single-wire feed.</p>
<p>Since June last year, all Soviet amateurs have revised the regions, and their call signs have also been changed.</p>
<p>Amateur radio stations are listened to with very little tax, which includes some special donations. In addition, the sending and receiving of telegrams must be transferred through the "Central Bureau of Shortwave Department" and the local shortwave department. Communication with other countries uses the language of the "International Amateur League". That is, domestic amateurs also use the language for mutual communication. For example, "TCF" means ordinary telegram, and in the Soviet Union, it is used to mean QSO (communication).</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly talk about the situation of broadcasting stations. There is a Moscow Broadcasting Station 35 kilometers north of Moscow, using 16 50,000-watt water-cooled vacuum tubes. The antenna power is about 100,000 watts, and the last stage uses Class B amplification.</p>
<p>In the same room, there is also a 20,000-watt transmitter. (End)</p>

<p>I recently received a gift of Volume 1, Issue 11 of the Philips Wireless Magazine published by Philips Foreign Company at 133 Sichuan Road, Shanghai on the 15th of this month. It contains a detailed manufacturing method of the latest energy-saving battery radio, starting from the method of winding coils, parts layout, and straight to how to start the whole machine after assembly. Each section is explained with detailed diagrams, and the text is simple and detailed. Even those who have no experience in wireless can read this article and make a radio with excellent results. It has the same wonderful effect as the industrial lamp machine manufacturing method published in the ninth issue of the magazine, and the attached ring history is more detailed. In addition, there are wireless elementary discussion and wireless terminology review, etc., all written by Mr. Cheng Yikun, the editor-in-chief of the magazine (note: Mr. is a member of the World Wireless Engineer Society). Finally, there is also a "Wireless Little Brain" that specializes in the simple manufacturing and design methods of various parts used in various wireless radios. Readers can make various sophisticated parts with very ordinary materials. It is a must-have reference book for amateur wireless researchers. Moreover, the magazine is promoting wireless, so the price is extremely low (the annual subscription of 12 issues is only one yuan and five cents in silver dollars. Postage stamps are calculated at 90% of the silver dollar value, and an additional 10 cents for postage outside the local area). The printing is excellent and the decoration is beautiful. All readers of this newspaper who state that they are introduced by Mr. Xiao Xiuqing or Mr. Qin Ximin of this newspaper can not only avoid postage outside the local area, but also use postage stamps at full value, so I am happy to introduce it.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Complete Westernization? Colonialization? <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>The fact that China is under imperialist aggression is now recognized by everyone, although Dr. Hu Shi once regarded it as an incredible tale. Regarding the method of aggression, the European and American factions covet money and advocate turning China into an economic colony; the Eastern faction covets land even more, so they advocate turning China into a political colony. As for the faction that promotes imperialist culture (that is, Western culture) within China, they go a step further than the previous two factions and advocate turning China into a cultural colony. Their slogan is complete Westernization.</p>
<p>The former faction seizes our markets, the middle faction seizes our land, and the latter faction seizes our spirit. The so-called seizing our spirit, in old words, is seizing our hearts. Comparing the gains and losses of these three factions, the latter faction is the fiercest. Because after imperialist culture dominates our consciousness, we will reach a state of dead hearts and will never be able to turn over. Hu Shi does not understand abstract nouns such as imperialism, and both subjectively and objectively defends it, which is because his consciousness has been imperialized.</p>
<p>Therefore, the theory of complete Westernization is a theory of surrender to imperialism in the ideological world and a theory of cultural colonization.</p>
<p>The initiator of this theory is Hu Shi, an international scholar created by the material and spiritual pillars of European and American international imperialism. This can be understood by simply reading his article "Our Attitude Towards Modern Western Civilization". Today, Chen Xujing and Liang Shiqiu, etc., have succeeded him. They go a step further and advocate obliterating China itself, saying that it can only imitate imperialist culture. Liang Shiqiu even made it clear that we cannot create, and advocating creation is megalomania (Dagong Daily, June 9 this year). This is tantamount to saying that the Chinese are only worthy of being coolies and compradors for imperialist culture.</p>
<p>In this case, are our introduction work wrong? It was progressive in the past and had the value of literary revival; now, after "1927", it is a conservative thing. In the fundamental sense, it had creative value in the past (relatively), and it was regarded as a means (for the sake of absolute creation); now, it is willing to introduce and opposes creation.</p>
<p>Such an introduction does not have the meaning of a cultural enlightenment movement, but the meaning of a cultural colonization. The Chinese consciousness should not be independent and free to create, but can only be subordinate to the West.</p>
<p>But, according to you, can China create culture? Yes. France in the 18th century was more backward than England at that time. They introduced Locke, but created a more thorough epistemology than Locke; introduced Newton, but created a more perfect worldview than Newton. Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries was more backward than England and France at that time, but Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel and other great philosophers and Marx, Engels and other great thinkers appeared. Russia in the 20th century was more backward than England, France and Germany. However, today, since 1917, it has become the pioneer of the world's new culture—socialist culture. It is simply a law that backward countries have contributions in culture.</p>
<p>Why? There is only one reason, that is, starting from the cutting edge of historical development. To put it plainly, it starts from the direction of development implied by advanced countries. To put it in words that everyone knows, it is "catching up from the front." For example, if the power engine of industry has gone from water to steam to electricity in advanced countries, then you should go straight ahead from electricity. This can leave room for creativity. Starting from water is called following along, and you can only imitate and cannot create forever.</p>
<p>In this way, in order to have a creative effect in culture, one must start from socialism. Because it is something that is just emerging in the West and urgently needs people to exert their creativity. This is why Russia has moved to the forefront of world cultural history. If our introduction starts from capitalism and is only satisfied with capitalism, then there is absolutely no creativity. Because capitalism has gone through 300 years in the West. Now, it has gone from germination to development to aging, and there is no room for creation. Introducing this kind of culture is obviously taking a downward path.</p>
<p>What Hu Shi, Chen Xujing, Liang Shiqiu, etc. introduced is superficially Western culture, but in fact it is capitalist culture—imperialist culture. They follow along, and they will only follow in other people's footsteps for the rest of their lives, so they certainly don't feel creativity. Therefore, Hu Shi openly advocated imitation and said that imitation is creation ("Independent Review" No. 13). Chen Xujing's complete Westernization is complete imitation. Liang Shiqiu then vilified creation as megalomania.</p>
<p>Such imitation is a cultural surrender. Chinese nation, fall into the arms of imperialism. If it wants to turn you into an economic colony and a political colony, then you should go one step further and become a cultural colony!</p>
<p>We who oppose imperialism do not agree. We demand economic independence and freedom, political independence and freedom, and even more cultural independence and freedom. If the first two demands are a kind of practical behavior, and the latter is a kind of conscious activity, and human behavior must pass through consciousness, then the demand for cultural independence and freedom is the beginning of relieving economic oppression and political oppression, that is, the entire oppression. It represents the awakening of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>After eighty or ninety years of oppression, especially after the "September 18th Incident", the "January 28th Incident", and the "Hebei Issue", advocating cultural independence and freedom is a spiritual protest of intellectuals. No, it is still the new beginning of the Chinese nation's unwillingness to succumb after the new oppression and demand for the independence and freedom of the entire organization.</p>
<p>Down with the foreign compradors in the cultural circle!</p>
<p>Create a new culture from the cutting edge of historical development!</p>
<h3 id="e216">"Germany in 1848" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jianfang</p>

<p>—One of the History Reading Notes—</p>
<p>"Germany in 1848," also known as "Revolution and Counter-Revolution." In the past, this book was generally thought to be written by Marx, but since the publication of the Marx-Engels correspondence, people have learned that the book was actually written by Engels. This is a famous work on the study of the German Revolution of 1848. The editor of this book, Eleanor Marx (Marx's daughter), said that this book and Marx's "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" are unparalleled, and she is absolutely right.</p>
<p>I read this book a long time ago. This time, because I wanted to make a comparative study of German history from the 17th and 18th centuries and the early 19th century with the history of China in the last hundred years, I read the book again in detail. After reading this book this time, I not only felt that the modern history of China and the history of Germany from 1523 to 1848 have many similarities, but also discovered that the German Revolution of 1848 and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 also have many similarities.</p>
<p>Before 1848, Germany was a country with many small feudal states. Before 1911, China was also like that. Before 1848, Germany was a country dominated by France and Russia. Before 1911, China was also like that. In 1848, the power of the feudal princes in Germany was higher than that of the German middle class at that time. In 1911, China was also like that.</p>
<p>The Revolution of 1848 failed. The reason for the failure was naturally due to the feudal lords' opposition to nationalism and the weakness and incompetence of the German middle class. Therefore, the Revolution of 1848 not only failed to unify Germany, but led to great division. The most obvious manifestation of this division was that Austria, which shared the same race and culture, completely separated from Germany and became independent. This was the result of 1848, and this result is very similar to our Revolution of 1911. However, Germany was better than China at that time. On the one hand, the development of capitalism in Germany in 1848 seemed to be higher than that in China. On the other hand, Germany in 1848 did not have as much surplus population as China in 1911. Therefore, the Revolution of 1848 only led to the independence of Austria, and did not lead to a Chinese-style warlord civil war. However, according to Engels, this possibility was fully present at that time.</p>
<p>As for China, because of its vast land area, weak capitalist development, the existence of a large surplus population, and the formation of centrifugal forces in local military groups against the central government, the Revolution of 1911 directly became a signal for warlord wars. Naturally, many of the civil wars after the Revolution of 1911 were caused by imperialist powers wanting to compete for spheres of influence in China, but if China did not have a foundation for imperialism to exploit, even imperialism could not cause civil wars.</p>
<p>China's internal wars in the past decades were based on the struggle between the Manchu Qing Empire and the Hong Yang uprising. In order to fight against the Hong Yang uprising, the Manchu Qing Empire had to allow local landlords to freely train troops, and in order to save the central government's financial shortages, it had to allow local landlords to freely set up Likin checkpoints. This situation is exactly the same as the situation after the German Peasants' Revolt in 1523. The German Peasants' War was the beginning of the ebb of German history, and the Chinese Hong Yang Uprising was also the beginning of the ebb of Chinese history. The German Peasants' Revolt directly led to the German local princes' struggle against central centralization, leading to the Thirty Years' War from 1618 to 1648. The result of the Chinese Hong Yang Uprising led to the warlord civil wars of the past ten years. According to Engels, the result of the German Thirty Years' War was that Germany completely withdrew from the historical stage of European national political activities for two hundred years. The social consequences of the Chinese Peasants' War also made it impossible for China to rise up in the past sixty or seventy years.</p>
<p>When in 1848, according to Engels, there were three paths to German unification:</p>
<p>The first was to overthrow all the numerous states and achieve true unification, that is, the path of open revolution.</p>
<p>The second was unification under the leadership of Austria.</p>
<p>The third was unification under the leadership of Prussia.</p>
<p>As we know, the first and second paths both failed, and later Germany realized the third path.</p>
<p>How was this third path realized? As everyone knows, this was the result of Bismarck's iron-blood policy. Although the Revolution of 1848 failed, German capitalism did not stop as a result. On the contrary, from 1848 to 1863, German capitalism developed faster than Chinese capitalism after 1911. Because of this development, Bismarck was able to obtain the support of the middle class to unify Germany. The two wars that Bismarck waged in 1864 and 1866 for unification were of revolutionary significance. These wars were not fundamentally different from the Northern Expedition in China from 1925 to 1927. On the contrary, their historical significance was very similar.</p>
<p>Bismarck's victory symbolized the regaining of national unity by Germany. Although this unification was completed by the upper class, it had a very important significance for the development of the German nation. In 1866, when Bismarck had indeed achieved victory over Austria, Germany's greatest enemy at that time was France. At this time, France's obstruction of German unification was just like Japan's obstruction of Chinese unification now.</p>
<p>At that time, France was ruled by Napoleon III, whose policy was to try to keep Germany divided. He wanted Germany to retain the situation of being ruled by many small states so that he could manipulate it from the middle. Therefore, German unification would inevitably force Germany to go to war with France. The Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870. As a result, Prussia defeated France, and the unified German Empire was completely established.</p>
<p>From the study of German history, can we make some kind of diagnosis of the current situation in China? This is what I think is most worthy of our attention.</p>

<p>Sixteen, Yadong Bookstore</p>
<p>Yadong Bookstore, which started with textual research, punctuation of old novels, really made a little fortune in the past few years. Yadong's success (naturally only refers to making money) was really a fluke. Because, after the New Youth era, Hu Shi was "very popular", and several collections of Hu Shi's essays were published by Yadong. At the same time, old vernacular novels were more valued by the general public because of the vernacular movement. Moreover, with the addition of the textual research and punctuation of Dr. Hu, the "initiator" (?) of the vernacular movement, it would inevitably be even more valuable than Luoyang paper (at that time, there were many such old novels, and students in the more stubborn middle and primary schools could only secretly read them. Since Dr. Hu advocated them, many were adopted as extracurricular reading materials or supplementary readers). And these books were all published by Yadong Bookstore. With the success of Lu Xun alone, the current "Beixin" was produced. How could Yadong not make a fortune at that time?</p>
<p>Each bookstore with a smaller scope, due to the subjective decisions of the host or the person in charge of the editorial department, will often form a system or characteristic in publishing. However, Yadong, except for punctuating old novels, does not have such a system or characteristic. Yadong's new books are not few, there are dozens of them. Among them, some are monographs on social sciences such as dialectics, and some are inexplicably "Week X" school of literature. You only need to look through Yadong's circular book catalog to know the incompetence of the editorial department of the bookstore, or that the host is simply a bookseller who does not understand publishing.</p>
<p>Soon, crudely made new culture publishing houses and other punctuated books competed for sales, and a tide of punctuated books with discounts of 20%, 30% and even 40% surged behind. A bookstore without a publishing strategy would inevitably be at a loss.</p>
<p>Seventeen Women's Bookstore</p>
<p>Shanghai's bookstores are usually gathered in the Qipan Street area of Fuzhou Road, but there are also exceptions. The Women's Bookstore is located in the middle of many massage parlors in Xiahui Road. This is the deepest impression that the Women's Bookstore gives our readers. Secondly, it is the name "Women's Bookstore", but it is only this name. The "Women's Library" and "Women's Monthly" published by it seem to be far from the former Commercial Press's "Women's Magazine" and the enlightened "New Woman". However, publications such as "Women's Magazine" and "New Woman" are not only mostly edited and written by men, but also mostly read by men. Therefore, given the backwardness of women's knowledge level, "Women's Monthly" is enough to show that it is a reading material for women. And "Women's Voice", which often shows its neck and shoulders in newspaper advertisements now, is just like this, and can be called a pair of sister flowers with "Women's Monthly". However, recently, Ms. Huang Xinmian, the editor of "Women's Monthly" and "Women's Library", passed away due to illness. The host of the Women's Bookstore is no longer a woman, but Mr. Yao Mingda, a man. Perhaps the Women's Bookstore and the books it publishes will have considerable reforms in the future.</p>
<p>Eighteen New China Bookstore</p>
<p>"The New China" has a short history and is now in silence. The New China did not give us much to pay attention to in the past, but when Kaiming moved to a new location and the New China moved into the old site of Kaiming, it did attract everyone's attention a little. However, since the establishment of the retail department, the New China has become increasingly silent.</p>
<p>The first book published by the New China is the Literary Series, followed by children's books. In addition, few new books are published. These two types of books are very "adapted to the trend" because other bookstores are publishing this type of book at this time. Because of this, the New China had to remain silent because the Literary Series and children's books of the New China lagged behind others, and it itself had few characteristics that could be rushed forward. It is very regrettable for such a bookstore because it gains nothing in terms of "profit" and "promoting culture".</p>

<h3 id="e218">Relief and Prevention of Drought <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The unfortunate Chinese peasants have had to live under the scourge of natural and man-made disasters every year in recent years. Since the beginning of summer this year, drought conditions have formed in various places, either due to lack of rain or drying up of rivers and canals. Recently, reports of disaster conditions from various provinces have been flooding in. It is reported that the rivers in Henan Province are dry and the sand is blowing, the wind and hail in Jiangsu Province are causing disasters, black frost has fallen repeatedly in Shaanxi Province, floods and hailstorms have occurred in Anhui Province, floods have occurred in Fujian Province, and strong winds and rain have caused disasters in Chahar Province. From this, it can be seen that the drought and disaster conditions in various places have not only not been alleviated, but also tend to be more dangerous. The general peasants are once again trapped in deep water and scorching heat. If relief and prevention are not planned early, the rural areas will inevitably go from decline to collapse in the future. The future of the national economy is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>The relief measures naturally only hope that the government authorities and various charitable organizations will work together to carry out. Provide disaster-stricken areas in various provinces with relief grain so that countless victims will not have to eat bark and grass roots or wait to die of starvation. May patriotic compatriots across the country take compassion as their guide, do their best, and donate generously to save a generation of innocent victims. As the saying goes, be prepared for danger in times of peace. Once the rural areas go bankrupt, the collapse of the cities will inevitably follow. Everyone must not regard the cries of the victims in various places as irrelevant and fail to provide assistance.</p>
<p>As for prevention, this work is also very urgent. Although drought is a natural disaster, it can be prevented. But as the Westerners say, human power can overcome nature. If we can find ways to dredge rivers and canals in places where drought has already appeared, in order to prepare for a rainy day, we may be able to remedy the situation. Otherwise, if we allow the drought to strike, there will be no hope for the autumn harvest, and the lives of many poor peasants will be even more insecure.</p>
<p>In addition, once a drought occurs in the rural areas, unscrupulous grain merchants will take advantage of the fire to rob. Either hoarding goods for speculation or raising grain prices. Its impact on general public food is extremely harmful. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will also pay close attention to this situation and strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from manipulating grain to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Lodging <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Jia</p>
<p>Because of an unexpected event, I hastily left home and ran to this place in the countryside on the same afternoon to live.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is due to recalling the past and unconsciously increasing a lot of cordiality in the mood of parting. When I arrived on the first day, the host greeted me with extremely strong emotions and sincere attitude, which made me feel very comforted - I had a place to stay temporarily. As dusk approached, without me saying anything, the host seemed to understand and prepared a bed for me.</p>
<p>"Maybe I will stay for a few more days," I declared.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, stay as long as you want," the host replied sincerely.</p>
<p>In the evening, the lights were turned off and we slept in our quilts, still talking incessantly about the different encounters during the years of separation, and recalling the various interesting and nostalgic memories of middle school. When we felt that we had finished talking and were a little sleepy, we fell asleep in a daze.</p>
<p>So I settled down casually.</p>
<p>When I encountered an unfortunate situation in my own territory, and I was very poor, being able to obtain a place to eat and sleep was the first thing that I couldn't accept was having to get up very early every day and go to bed very early at night - the host still maintained the lifestyle habits of a student, and it would be very painful for me, who had been immersed in the metropolis for a long time and had all the characteristics of a city dweller, to change all of a sudden. Although I tried my best to do it, I couldn't change it after all, and I still got up late and went to bed late every day. At first, the host seemed to be because of my initial arrival and didn't make any indication. After a few days, he said to me with a very serious face:</p>
<p>"Isn't this kind of life too decadent? Why have you become like this?" At the same time, a nearly arrogant smile appeared on his face, thinking that he was not decadent.</p>
<p>"It's become a habit. For the past few years since I started writing articles, my life has been like this. I know it's decadent, but I can't help it."</p>
<p>I had to give in to cater to his tone, but I felt a little ridiculous in my heart for his such simple-minded views.</p>
<p>So the host, who was easily pleased, smiled triumphantly again.</p>
<p>Being easily pleased and easily angered is exactly the host's consistent temperament. I was clear about his impulsive nature since we were middle school classmates, and it hasn't changed at all. In his words and actions, he always likes to reveal a boast of being smart and knowing more things than others. Whenever he discusses a problem with his family, it is often just casual talk and laughter, but the result is often a bitter mutual slander and malicious quarrel, until they all leave with blue faces and resentment. Therefore, when we talk about China, no matter what, there will be no conflict or anger, because every time I let him occupy all the benefits of the argument.</p>
<p>I know that living in someone else's home, just eating and sleeping, needs to eliminate myself as much as possible in any way, belittle myself, and even bury all my personality and thoughts, in order to accommodate everything of the host and earn good feelings and intimacy. Because of this, my spirit has increased a burden of suffering forced by the environment.</p>
<p>Why do I have to be like this, just because I live in someone else's home.</p>
<p>A month passed quickly. Tomorrow I will leave here. Although I have to worry about work, the pain of wearing shackles of spiritual unfreedom is even greater than the pain of worrying about work. And in the end, I still have to bid farewell to the host with a mouthful of gratitude: "These days, I have been treated kindly, and I have bothered you enough. Thank you."</p>
<p>Fortunately, tomorrow the shackles on my spirit can be removed.</p>
<h3 id="e220">A Story of Country Living <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Ying</p>
<p>Under the south window is the courtyard of the new residence. Two rows of low-lying winter green trees sandwich a flower path paved with herringbone bricks. Near the stone altar are four parasol trees, which were newly planted last spring. Because of the gardener's kind cultivation, the trunks have grown taller than the building windows. The large chestnuts, like umbrellas, sway lightly in front of the window. I think about the owner's deliberate embellishment, but now I am enjoying it at the lowest rental price.</p>
<p>Last year, when I came out of the hospital, the doctor advised me to live in the countryside, but because of my profession, I could never leave the city. However, the determination to live in the country was laid in my heart at that time. This time, I accidentally found this suburban residence and moved in very smoothly.</p>
<p>The owner of the house is an old woman in her fifties. When my wife first visited, she babbled for half a day in such a frank manner. She told my wife that her son had disappeared after a failure in the stock exchange. Her property was used to repay her son's debts, leaving only this suburban house and an eight-year-old grandson and an old servant living here. She said more shamefully that the countryside was too lonely, and at the same time, she wanted to increase a little income to help the household. At the suggestion of the old servant, she posted an advertisement to recruit a formal co-resident.</p>
<p>The next day we agreed with each other and moved in. The house is a row of three rooms, two entrances. We rented the front entrance. If we wanted to rent the same house in the city, I am afraid it would be more than three or four times the rent.</p>
<p>We kept the middle room as our own bedroom, the left side was for the child and the nanny, and the right side agreed with my wife's opinion to set up a guest room. She said that although it takes an hour by bus to reach Shanghai, it is inconvenient for friends and relatives to come and go after all. Living in the countryside without a place for guests to stay overnight seems to be against the rules.</p>
<p>The hall downstairs in the middle is for public use. I made the room on the right a study. I longed for a quiet study where I could lock myself in and read a little bit. This wish has now been realized. When we moved in, the owner was surprised that I had so much luggage. In fact, most of it was my books. The old family servant asked if I was "a teacher," perhaps for this reason too.</p>
<p>The room on the left is naturally a reception room. Fortunately, the owner lent us many pieces of furniture, otherwise, moving from a living room where we lived, ate, and dressed, and now we have to distribute it to five rooms, it would be an excellent joke.</p>
<p>That night, we finished arranging it a little bit. The owner came over with her grandson and said a few words in Mandarin. She repeated yesterday's story. Older people like to talk a lot. Now it seems that she has a counterpart. She almost exclusively talked about her family's history. In the end, she cried with sobs. This made me feel a little dissatisfied. If she recites the story of her son doing stock exchange whenever she has the opportunity, it is really too embarrassing. She has been greatly stimulated, and reciting it like that seems to relieve a little pain. However, this pain will be transferred to others. To put it jokingly, it is also not suitable for my purpose of recuperating.</p>
<p>My wife listened attentively and said many comforting words, just like a mother comforting a child who had been beaten and cried back home. Although I didn't insert a word of exclamation about this story from beginning to end, I leaned against the window, staring blankly at the bright moon moving from the clouds. The courtyard was like being covered with a piece of broken brocade, fantasizing that the owner's son was a great businessman who was good at management, with flexible wrists, a mind that was good at thinking, and a wide body with a fat face. Perhaps he had a small beard. That kind of person failed in the stock exchange and left behind his elderly mother, who was babbling about this indelible history. And the villa was being enjoyed by such an ordinary person. A tragic scene of suicide seemed to float before my eyes, but the old man still hoped that her son would return!</p>
<p>When she was leaving, she said to my wife, "My son graduated from university. If he comes back, he will definitely get along well with Mr. Ling."</p>
<p>I watched her back as she went downstairs, feeling dazed and not relieved. I poured out two sleeping pills from the medicine bottle. I was afraid that I would have insomnia tonight.</p>

<p>— Especially</p>
<p>It was night, and all around was silence.</p>
<p>This house must have been built five or six years ago, wouldn't you say? The walls were so black, the original whiteness long gone, and speckled with dots. From a distance, some might mistake them for patterns, but in fact, they were the remains of small creatures that appeared with the season.</p>
<p>The weather, in the season when the sun was nearly equatorial, made the ground oily during the day, and this cage-like house had the sweltering heat of a steamer. The people living inside felt suffocated.</p>
<p>But the stifling feeling was not very long-lasting. When the cool evening breeze gently blew, this square house did not lose its blessing due to its size. However, no matter how worthless the place was, life was still precious. Therefore, to preserve this precious life, the windows had to be closed before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Somehow, with a heart devoured by fatigue, it was almost impossible to fall asleep immediately upon lying in bed. Thinking about the things of the day, the arrogant faces, and how to work the next day, the heart became particularly uneasy.</p>
<p>Pushing open the only window, the high sky was a black expanse, without the seductive stars or the silvery moon. The fields below were dense, as if holding back rain.</p>
<p>In the light breeze, a burst of crying came, sharp and shrill!</p>
<p>—Spare me, ah, heavens… It was mournful, like a child being beaten.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, the weary mood was invigorated a bit. Leaning on the window, it was very quiet, without a single disturbing sound. The cold air blew, both here and there.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the response to being beaten? Gradually, the sound grew louder, and the mournful element became particularly strong. It sounded familiar, and I realized it was the woman across the street punishing the servant she bought, Ah Rong.</p>
<p>It seemed as if some force was gripping me. Listening, a gust of cold wind hit me, and when I closed my eyes, countless sparks flashed and danced before my face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sparks parted to both sides, revealing an uneven face, a small body, tattered clothes, sallow and thin skin, throbbing and swollen eyes and nose, and a state of mingled fear and terror.</p>
<p>The beatings, of course, would not end there. On the contrary, from the crisp sounds, it was clear that they were even more severe. But somehow, the cries of sorrow could no longer be heard. All that could be heard was rapid scolding and rebuke.</p>
<p>The distant lights flickered on and off as the leaves swayed.</p>
<p>When the sunset once again streamed into my room, I dragged my heavy feet into the alley, but where was Ah Rong? She was nowhere to be seen. Entering the house, my head was dizzy, and a wave of irresistible heat rushed over me. I thought, maybe she was seriously injured, maybe she was lying in bed, maybe... different bad thoughts swirled around.</p>
<p>At night, I closed the windows as usual, tossing and turning in bed as usual. Suddenly, a thin girl, naked from the waist up, covered with stripes of blood, tears welling in her eyes, her mouth constantly sobbing, her face wearing a look of misery, appeared.</p>
<p>Finally, she cried, the corners of her mouth twitching, trembling in fear, as if she wanted to say something.</p>
<p>My mood was so disturbed that I couldn't sleep peacefully. I pushed open the window again, and the rain gently pattered. The distant lights flickered on and off as the leaves swayed. All around, everything was silent.</p>

As a result, when they were about to forcibly rape her, it became clear that the aunt and sister-in-law were his own sister and wife, and the Xue'er who was thrown to death was his own son! Although he later realized, it was too late!</p>

<p>Ouyang Yuqian, director of the Xinhua Film Company, led Jin Yan, Hu Ping, Tong Yuejuan, Gu Menghu, and others to Hangzhou to film the outdoor scenes of "The Peach Blossom Fan." They have now all returned. After a test screening, the results are very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Hu Ping is grateful to Xie Sufang for being an actress who cross-dresses to play old dramas such as Hong Ni Guan. Her appearance is bright and beautiful, and her stage steps are solid. She is truly a rare talent.</p>
<p>Jin Yan likes to drink beer. Recently, as his work has become more intense, Jin Yan has been drinking more and more.</p>
<p>Before the premiere of "The Peach Blossom Fan," it is planned to carefully make a kind of round fan painted with peach blossoms, and a delicate sandalwood bone fan, to be widely gifted to all circles. It is currently being processed and printed.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Hollywood's Famous Playwright Visits "Triumphant Song" with Sassoon <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a famous movie playwright from Hollywood, named Mackve, inquired about his friends in China about which production company was the greatest and wanted to visit it. So, his friends accompanied him to the Yihua Company. Coincidentally, Bu Wancang was directing "Triumphant Song." A magnificent set with a Chinese rural flavor stood in the studio. The actors Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Yu Guilin, Qin Tong, Liu Guan Hongda, Jiang Xiu, and others were all dressed in summer clothes and acting. They found it very interesting and brought many "Ahmor" and "Rahm 克" cameras to take as many pictures as possible. Director Bu Cang introduced the actors to them. Mackve spoke English, saying that Miss Yuan was very lively and very "special blessing." They didn't leave until 12:30, and before leaving, they took a photo with all the staff.</p>
<h3 id="e228">A Play Within a Play in "The Song of One Heart" <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>"The Song of One Heart," Two Hearts in Waltz Time, starring the king of song, Carl Breilson, has completed the examination procedures in Nanjing and Shanghai and will be released in Shanghai soon. This is Breilson's latest and best work, with superior results far beyond "Bloodstains on the Song Robe" and "The Merry Emperor." There are three musical plays in the movie, depicting a group of women who, because they resent the false feelings of the men, escape to a deserted island and decide to sever relations with men. Later, the men chased after them in airplanes. At that time, the women on the island also felt that life was monotonous, and finally softened. Not only were the songs and music properly matched, but the performance also contained a satirical meaning. It is said that the fake airplane on the stage was completed by the set designer in only twelve hours when filming, but the appearance was no different from a real airplane, which can be said to be ingenious.</p>

<p>"Movie Star Photo Collection" edited by Chen Jiazhen has been well received by movie fans since the first collection was published, and the sales have been unexpectedly good. The second collection is "Fitness Number," and the arrangement and material selection are even more outstanding. The whole book is printed in fine print on one hundred and twenty-pound copperplate paper. Each photo can be framed and placed on the desk, which is extremely beautiful. The book collects a book of fitness photos of more than thirty female stars, which is very rare. All major bookstores in the country sell it. If you want to try reading it, please attach a two-dime stamp and send it to Sanhe Publishing House, No. 54 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and a copy will be sent immediately.</p>
