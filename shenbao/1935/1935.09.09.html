<h3 id="c26">英日談判之展望 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>英國以遠東問題。不可坐視其殘化英日關係不。可久陷於無秩序狀况。故派其政府中第一流專家羅斯爵士來遠東一行。名為調查中國之經濟財政。實負有解决東亞糾紛之使命。自爵士起程以後。日本報界卽盛傳爵士之赴日。將與東京政府。討論分割中國市塲。開放英國諸自治領及殖民地之門戶。以容納日貨。及解决海軍問題之爭執。興華北滿洲等問題之癥結。雖倫敦政府再三聲明。爵士之任務僅限於調查興建議。不涉及政治上之談判。然吾人觀察英國外交之現狀。及保守黨政府之態度。東京所傳。必非無因。松平已返國。日本駐英使館商務參贊松山。亦於日內到東京。羅斯此行道經加拿大。上星期安抵東京。此英日關係調整之初步談判。吾人不可不加注意也。</p>
<p>英國在遠東勢力之日趨消沈。乃歐戰以後遠東關係中最重要之事實。日本崛起。在經濟上。軍備上。政治上。均使英國無保持昔日優勢之可能。九一八以後。繼以日貨在英屬地之傾銷。英國雖以提高　關稅等方法相抵抗。已顯示許多弱點。蓋在地理上。武力上。營業上。目前之英國。已非日本之敵。英國之問題。僅為如何保存其現有權益。庶使其數十年來艱苦經營而成之遠東勢力。不致全部消散。日本之希望。為獨佔遠東。英國之希望。僅為保持一定之勢力範圍。故觀目前趨勢。使日本稍稍讓步。英國為未來之安全計。必不惜以中國之市塲。作交換之條件。今日本不但欲併華北於其經　勢力圈中。且駸駸然欲逐英國人於香港或新加坡以南。羅斯之所能為力者。至多僅能梢緩和日本對英國遠東及印度已有權益之侵略。或導日本之澎漲力於一定方向。以减少英國所受之損失。吾人如希望藉英國之力。阻日本在華之俊略。直等於夢想耳。</p>
<p>據報載日本外　省對英談判之根本方針。有『央國宣將其世界領土。為日本而開放。』及『不許英國阻止日本在滿洲興中國方面發展。』等項。此非日本之誇言。而為日本政府之眞實希望。數日以來。日文報紙。警吿英國之言論。層出不窮。如要英國之交出中國海國及改造上海工部局等等。氣燄之盛。不可鄉邇。然日本有經濟力與武力為後盾。彼唯實主義之英國人。慣於忍受。在一定限度之下。英國當不惜犧牲白人在遠東之威望。而求稍稍保全內實利也。况意阿之糾紛。已達爆裂之點。英國一旦捲入旋渦。則更無餘力顧及遠東。英國之飛機兵艦有限。而日本之慾望無窮。當紅海地中海一帶戰爭爆發之日。卽日本武力伸入香港新加坡印度之時。使目前英國不與日本妥協。餌以重利。則蘇彝士以西。當英國有事於歐洲非洲時。必遭日本之染指。况澳洲新錫蘭一帶。久為日本所覬覦。英無力東顧。又未能與美國切實合作。日本澎漲之可能性。未知所止也。</p>
<p>故東京談判。必因非洲風雲之緊張。而增加困難。歐洲之局面意困難。日本之態度將愈强硬。英國之屈伏。愈有可能。羅斯不幸而於意阿戰爭迫於眉睫之際行抵東京。中國不幸而於羅斯到日之際。有華北經濟提携之談判。觀於目前情勢。遠東方面之英國勢力固難免於消退。而吾國處境尤屬危險異常。秉國鈞者可不戰戰兢兢。愼重將事。以渡此當前之難關哉。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）最近羅斯福總統與賀華特報社董事長賀華特之往來函中、對於美國之新政前途、關係甚大、茲特錄其原文如下、</p>
<p>賀華特致總統函</p>
<p>羅總統閣下、鄙人居於獨立之編輯之地位、頗注意於新政之目標、亦力求明瞭何以商界方面對於閣下之計劃、徬徨徘徊、誹議反對者居多、而其他一般選民、則並無不滿之處、鄙人不信商界之利益與一般人民之利益必相衝突、鄙人對於閣下政見、雖在枝節問題之間、難盡同意、然對於閣下之解釋美國自由主義、則紀表贊同、故謹以友好建設之精神、略陳鄙見如下、商界中若干份子反對現政府之態度、已顯而易見、若此等份子盡爲金融界之強暴、專以犧牲公衆利益而自肥者、當可不必注意、無奈全國商界以前以誠心擁護閣下者、現在已轉而惶懼、固不僅反對已也、目前不乏忠貞之士、深覺閣下所主張之新稅、爲對於商界之報復、而非爲國家收入之計、深覺政府係欲力避擴大徵稅限度之範圍、並覺政府如不能使實業得一喘息之機會、略爲停北試騐性之政策、俾使全國得恢復其損失、而商界得减除其惶懼之心理、則當無眞正之復興可言、閣下對於國家之各種問題、曾屢述閣下之地位、故鄙人亦不憚煩複、再複尊聽、誤解新政之徒已造成不少損害、閣下與鄙人皆知吾人立國之制度、雖有種種錯誤、然已往之成績、已能使吾人所成就之進步、勝於世界任何其他制度之多多、故閣下應速將淆惑民衆之說、以爲有秩序的改良、卽爲變相的革命者廓淸而消减之也、賀華特啟、</p>
<p>羅斯福覆賀氏函</p>
<p>賀華特先生閣下、來書甚威、尊示各節、旣根據於閣下觀察全國之意見所得、殊令鄙人不勝同情、且亦深知國會經過長時期之會議、通過之法案甚多、自不免一部份人民心中、引起若干紛亂之感想、</p>
<p>誹議不免　鄙人對於誹議之徒、儘可置之不顧、從未施政者、孰能不受誹議、其他具有政黨之偏見、或專事損人利已者、鄙人亦可無庸介意、尚有人焉、欲政府淸靜無爲、此輩於前總統羅斯福及威爾遜在位之時、卽已有此主張、國人亦孰知此種反對之意義爲如何矣、</p>
<p>接受批評　惟此外儘有誠懇公正之批評、願與政府互相切磋者、鄙人自當闡明政府之宗旨、解釋政府之方法、重申政府之理想、而大公無私之新聞界、以公共之福利爲懷、登載不偏不黨之新聞者、對於政府之此種努力、固亦與有力也、</p>
<p>袪除疑慮　夫經騐爲最良之敎　、結果爲最佳之證據、故如以政府之已往設施、略爲叙述、卽能怯除一切疑慮、而商界全體以後亦能同意於吾等之見地、卽商界之利益並不與全民之利益衝突、而實爲互相和諧者也、概言之、經濟衰落爲農商及金融各業組織不健全之累積、</p>
<p>立法救濟　吾人之立法、爲救濟此稱現象而起、故不能以之分析、孰爲復興孰爲改革、吾人之行動、悉依三年以前所定之根本經濟主張、當時鄙人曾言、應使美國人之經濟生活平衡、應恢複人民對於銀行制度之信任、應保障證券市塲投資者之益、應使勞動界有自由組織、並免受利用、應保護並開發國家之富源、應使年老及失業之人得社會保障、應救濟貧困、應使投資者及消費者减除贅疣公司之擔負、鄙人不信任何負責之政黨、對於上述目標之任一次、敢公然加以反對者也、</p>
<p>徵稅計劃　至於閣下所言之徵稅計劃、則係根據於一種廣大而公正之社會經濟目標、此項目標並非欲毀滅財富、惟欲產生一種範圍較廣之機會、欲防止不健全之積聚、而以政府之重責、令最能勝任者祖負、故受其影響者、僅爲年入五萬金以上之個人及超越四萬金之遺產、且大公司之納稅力量、勝於小公司、亦屬公認之事實、凡略明事理者當不致以爲此種稅則、卽將損及全體商界者也、况新法律成立之後、已使公司稅率百分之九十五、皆略爲减低、若云小額之過量利益稅等、則可鼓勵公司組織之籣單化、國會不允擴大徵稅限度之範圍、蓋因國會承認五年以來、業已擴大不少、討論之時、且曾以英國為例、主張美國公民、人人（中有脫字）數年來徵稅範圍之擴大皆爲間接稅、以致貧困者之担負較重、譬如一九二九年各項消費稅尚僅佔政府收入之三成、迄於今日、已佔六成、卽最近之稅案通過之後、亦不過减少半成而已、</p>
<p>審愼爲佳　現政府秉政之初、會有擴大之立法計劃、並知國內之情形、需要猛烈之行動、惟國會與鄙人、皆覺以審愼爲佳、俾使商界及一般人民、得以明瞭改革之所在、現在根本程序業已大致完成、而閣下所謂喘息之機會、已在是矣、</p>
<p>努力不懈　目前國內之情形、已大爲改善、復興之前途、自亦較易進步、失業雖未盡除、惟已漸漸减少、而政府對於解决失業問題之努力、仍未少懈、鄙人不敢自稱有魔術家之手段、亦不敢自稱環境之改善、全爲政府之力最、惟知政府之種種設施、對於人民自信力之恢復、確有不少助力耳、羅斯福啟、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>東行所得　茲謹作概括之報告、諸希指敎、查本團團員、共爲十五人、於二月二十二日出發、四月四日抵日本、四月十八日離日本、前往中國、四月二十六日抵上海、暢遊各處、六月十八日返國、七月三日回抵檀香山、在出發途中、團員幾無不不開會集議、回國時亦曾作數度會商、對於報告書內應採取之材料、已大致决定、令團團員咸能努力考求、而其</p>
<p>和衷共濟　之精神、尤爲本人所最引　幸者、調查團在日本及中國、備受極盛大之招待、當地工商業及金融領袖、均擬就完備秩序、殷勤指導、復得晋謁中日兩國最高長官之機會、在日本時、團員得晤日首相外相及其他閣員、在中國時、則曾謁見行政院長、財政部長、及其他長官、並與軍事委員會蔣委員長、作重要之會晤、本人忝　團長、並獲晋謁日本天皇、及中國國民政府主席、尤深榮　、在調查期間、各團員與中日兩國招待諸君、</p>
<p>交換意見　之外、並飽飫盛筵、各處工廠、儘量由團員參觀、亳無　藏、實開未有之先例、於成本之計算、工作之方法等等、均得　窺究竟、同時兩國政府所造具之統計報告、助益亦多、總之、此次東遊、其所受之歡迎、及所獲之協助、誠爲全國同人所引爲殊榮者、又有進者、本團與兩國領袖集議時、雙方均能開誠相見、以友誼之精神、討論促進自由貿易之方法、先求其困難癥結之所在、再將兩國意見、坦白陳述、以資爲草擬具體建議之借鏡、在日在華、各領袖之演說中、無論其爲代表政府、抑代表工商業、均致意於日美或中美兩國友誼之親善、於此本人須一再指出者、即本調查團絕無政治意味、並與政治事件全無關係、有時若政治與經濟交相總銷、至不能分離時、則本團之所致意者、仍爲其</p>
<p>經濟部分　其政治部分、則留待外交人員處理之、此外又有一點、本人會屢次指出者、即本團純爲一調查機關、並無執行權力、在日在華時、來訪者往往以爲本團之來遠東、可與工商界進行交易、談判價格、乃至訂立合同者、實則本團之使命、僅爲調查情形、以報告於國人、至其是否同情、則非調查團所可保證、本團在日調查、爲期較短、在華則較長、然此並非謂日美貿易較中美貿易爲不重要也、一九三四年、日美貿易、共達三二九·六七一·二四二元、而同年中美貿易、則爲一一二·五六四·三八一元、約爲日美貿易之三分之一、惟吾人咸知、中國之經濟發展、尚遠遜於日本、故在華機會有不能在日本獲得者、　如日本現已不需要外國資本以發展其各種公共事業、如鐵道汽船航空、及其他交通</p>
<p>如電話電報等等，而中國則在此種之事業、均有極佳之機會、中國政府刻正需要更多之　路船隻、及其他水陸空交通利器、然以資本缺乏、未能一一興辦、在某種情形下、當能</p>
<p>歡迎外資　尤有進者、中國工業之發展、遠不及日本、故美國與中國合作、以造成若干工業之基礎、機會頗多、而日本則　須繼續其現有工業、無須創立新業、其所需　他國之合作者、似僅在燃料油及汽油之供給、於此本團在日本時、已會與該國各領袖作數度之討論　、惟日本之主要問題厥爲紡織業最近之發展、現在該國紡鐵業、已入嚴　狀况、從前日本出口業最大之財源、即爲對美之絲輸出、近數年來、因種種原因尤以不景氣之影響、美國所需絲量、日見减少、而同時絲價亦大爲跌落、蓋現在日本對美輸出之絲、　價值較前已跌去百分之六十、而出口絲之噸數，則减少纔百分之二十耳、我國政府、近對本國原料出產、曾加重稅捐、故</p>
<p>生棉價値　大見增高、棉爲美國對日出口大宗、以價値之增高、遂致日本入超激增、日本當局、認爲一極嚴重之問題、調查團深覺日本即將另覓其他原料以代美棉、而我國出口最大宗之生棉、殆即將失去其主要市塲矣、中國　正試騐改良棉種、巴西亦有廣大區域、可作產棉之用、或者吾人將見以不智之方法、提高吾人出產品之價值、至不能與他國競爭時、其輸入國自不能不取自衛方法、而別在他國求同樣供給、則受害者反在此而不在彼、此實大可作深長思者也、日本現在計劃、可在本年年終、共得挺子一千萬枚、專門紡織棉織物、較之去年約多出挺子一百萬枚、此後尚期中年有同樣之增加、本團團員在大阪時、曾與該處紡績　聯合會數度交換重要意見、並參觀各廠、本團團員、目向日本建議、勿以過多貨物、以過低價格傾銷美國市塲、蓋若是、則美國必致迫而採取保護政策也、此事雖頗難管理、但吾人信日本方面、亦已感覺於此、或可採取具體</p>
<p>補救方法　日本工人所得工資、僅及我國工人工資十分之一、出產上之成本旣低、故其資本組織、較見經濟、每一挺子之出產亦較鉅、其工人雖工資不鉅、工時較長、亦均康健愉快、調查團在旅行中、見沿鐵路各處工廠勃興之速、至爲可驚、而觀其烟囪之冒烟、又可知其工作之繁忙也、調查團在日本考察之後、即前往中國、中國之情形與日本全不相同、所有問題、亦見殊異、其種種建議之大部、多涉及美國對華投資、蓋中國若干事業、均須有鞏國之財政基礎、頗望美國資本、能加入合作、尤其商業信用制度待發展者極多、以中國現况論、尚屬無能爲力也、美國雖爲中國之最佳主顧、但在華美商、頗多困難、而在上海一地、無論美僑及華人抱悲觀者尤多、調查團在華時、曾受勸告、上海並不能代表全中哦、而上海金融情形之凋疲、亦並不足表示中國全國均受同樣影響、就事實上言、上海現正感受地產業盛極轉衰之惡影響、上海地產價格、曾達到出乎想像之高點、其興也旣速、故其衰也亦驟、美政府購銀政策、尚未影響中國商業之前、地產業即發生反應、二三年前、赤匪在鄰近各省猖獗時、中國人民之有產業老、率冬將財產　買、携至上海保藏、吸至內地秩序大定、上海各銀行存欵、又有不少提作恢復內地工業之用上海存銀、當此流回內地之時、同時又受美國銀政策之影響、遂致竭蹶難支、而內地各處、則頗多欣欣向榮之觀、如鐵路收入之增加、即爲一種表示、然上海終爲全國金融之中心、調查團在華時、中國方面已再三聲言、美國購銀政策之影響於中國金融之嚴重矣、現在美國及若于其他國、已减低其幣值、以求促進其貿易、美國並已减低其金元價值至百分之五十九有零、是美國增進银價之結果、已使中國銀幣價值增進、幾達一倍、調查團與中國各金融家交換意見時、渠等一致以爲此事、　實致中國以重大影響、並减少其貿易至鉅、夫此等中國商人、將中國商業上之困難、　咎於</p>
<p>購銀政策　者、當然較本調查團、於調查後所能承認者爲多、至其基本重要原因、則實為各銀行地產公司及商人之經營地產業者、受地價跌落之影響、疲不能興、惟銀政策適當其時、致中國商業及貿易大受不利影響、向使銀價固定時、可以避免商業失敗、此時竟無法逃避、此則絕無疑義者也、本調查團並聞中國方面言、最使中國貿易受影響者、並不在銀價、而在幣制價值之起落無定、若使銀幣之價值固定不變、則不論其價值爲何、交易富較見活躍、否則比價時有上落、盈虧奄無把握、交易之不旺、固其宜也、調查團又聞美國在華商業、近來因政府種種立法、致大受影響、最近美國法院、對於確定商業利率之法令、曾有一影響僑華美商之解釋、即美商在滬所訂利率、應與美國哥侖比亞區所定者同、致美商在若干情形下、竟無法獲得現欵、又美國復興法規之普及於上海美商、而增加負擔、結果亦足使美商、轉向英　政府註冊、致美人事　而有英人董事會及英籍經理、其直接使美國商業蒙受不利者、蓋可顯見也、中國現在赤　　已逐至邊遠各處、尙待　淸、此外蘇俄在蒙古、及日本在與滿洲鄰近各省之勢力、均足减少中央政府統轄其國土之管理程度、在</p>
<p>幣制方面　中國雖有銀元爲國幣、但全國幣制尙未統一、廣東四川天津上海之紙幣價值各殊、其比價時有起落、與香港兩元、亦不一致、中國出口商人、尚有以劣質貨物攙入高質貨物混　者、此項自殺手叚、實足减低中國在世界市塲之令譽而使主顧另向其他商人求貨、如美國之購買桐油、即其一例、現政府正在設法取締此種惡習、當有成效可觀、中國最需補救之大弊、厥爲貨物之走私、然在現在淸形下、中國又屬無法完全控制稅收之、受鉅大影響無論矣、即所謂鬥戶開放、亦將僅爲一種名訶、蓋以私貨充斥、價格自然低廉、則正當貨物之欲求立足、難乎其難、欲求减少此弊、自應與</p>
<p>他國合作厲行緝私、總之美國人欲求投資中國、實爲良好之地、中美貿易之障礙、實至織小、吾人所當時時汴意者、應爲對華貿易之機會、蓋即有困難、亦僅　技術的、若能免除、則前途無量、兩國在天然富源上出產上乃至需要上、均無需競爭、而相需相成之處、則正多、以產絲衣棉之國、與產棉衣絲之國相交易、以工業極端發達之美國、以其出品、易中國手工所製成之奢侈品、蓋兩國均有其所需之天然產物、而又有衆多之人口、以保證長久之需要、則前途機會之良好、殆較其他任何市塲爲甚也、調查團在華時、曾得不少有益之建議、以發展美國貿易、中國當局在統一上之努力、凡爲中國之友、及世界文化什之友者、僉應加以恊助、調查團調查之結果、深覺中國在此革新（或可謂爲復生）之進程中、已達到美國應予積極合作充分投資之程度、中國現在竭須充分金錢上之援助、以促其努力、如鐵路、如航船、如飛機、如港口之開闢、如鑛產之掘發、如工廠之築造等等、若能舉措得宜、則新中國之進而爲强大興盛之國家、其迅速當爲全世界所震驚也、</p>

<p>— 顧掌擎</p>
<p>在本刊，曾有吳愛伯君理髮店前旋轉圓柱的解說，他是依據旅觀察談的記述，以爲來自歐洲，歐洲古代理髮師兼營外科醫生，此所以用作標幟的，這話似乎很有理，我國理髮師兼營外科醫生的也很多。不過據我曉得的，却另有一說，說是普法戰役，法有理髮師其勇猛善戰，一身死敵百餘人，卒罹於難，法當局嘉兵忠勇殉國，特在他屍身上裹以紅白藍國旗舁回原籍，算是表彰他，由此理髮同業引以爲榮，且爲紀念起見，各個理髮店的門首，都樹立這樣一個東西，一直流傳下來，而至於國外也都倣行着。</p>
<p>以王這個說數，只憑記憶的寫下來，姑存一說，倘或普法戰前已早有這個林子，或者還另有原因，筆者不敏，也不去推考了。</p>
<h3 id="c140">街燈 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>熱閙的街道上，矗立着而又連接着幾百支光的街燈，照耀得如同白畫，不用說得車馬和行人，沾光了不少：便是冷僻的馬路上，隔上十丈路遠近，映着一盞十幾支光的街燈，也使行人們脚卜明白，不致瞎撞。誰說街燈是一件點綴品，它在黑夜中竟和大　中指南針一的有功効。</p>
<p>各種事物，隨着年輪而進展，便是這小小的街燈，也經過了好多變遷。在我小的時候，熱鬧的街市，祗有着燐火般的天燈，是一支木柱。上邊安着一個琉璃方框，中間置放一盞火油燈。小街上連這種燈都沒有。在月白風淸的晚上，走在路上，還不覺得甚麽；要是風高月黑的當兒，你手裏不拿着燈燭，那未伸手不見五指，疏生的道路，隨你天大本領，也走不成。有時狗兒橫臥在街中，你會踹上一脚給它咬了一口；有時　前也來了行人，大家不及避讓，竟會猛烈的碰撞一下。不曾經過這種情形的人，一定以爲我在過甚其辭的胡道，要是你去問問老年的人，一定要說聲不錯咧！後來在上海的馬路上，火油的街燈是取消了，改裝了煤氣街燈，玻璃罩內再用着紗罩，放出碧綠的光燄來，雖是明亮卻也陰慘得有些怕人，可是內地連這種燈也沒有咧！直到電燈發明了，輸傳到中國來了，於是街燈也改用了最新裝置，街頭上也大放光明了。</p>
<p>以後的街燈將怎樣呢？據科學家的預　：—見五十年後之世界一書—現在東一盞西一　的街燈也嫌麻煩，只須在一個相當地點的空中，裝上一盞挺大的街燈，按上强大的電力，機關一扭，便和太陽一般明亮，這時恐怕連家中的燈火也用不着咧，不過這種街燈幾時才發明，請年靑的人們耐心的等着吧！想必一定能瞧得見的。</p>

<p>他聽到說樓上藍專員叫樓下的茶房，準是樓上那些同事，都沒有把事情弄得好。所以要另換一個生手上去。說不定他拿出二十塊三十塊錢出來買東西，可以大大的從甲佔些便宜。於是答應了一個哦字，兩脚踏了樓梯就向上跑。走到專員房門口，先頓了一頓緩過一口氣，然後從從容容的進去。只見監專員仰坐有椅子上口　啣了烟斗，態度却也自然，掉上擺了一個酒瓶子，幾隻　了的罐頭，酒氣薰蒸，大概是他用過晚酌之後。他太太一手按了桌子站定，瞪了眼問道：你是樓下的茶房嗎？馬三道；是的，太太叫來有什麽吩咐？藍太太道：你那樓底下，住了一個什麽女人，這樣夜深，還在息息率率的哭？馬三郤不料叫上來是問這樣一句話，先有三分不高興，便答道！這是客人的家眷，不知道他爲什麼哭？藍太太道：你們當茶房的，都只會吃飯嗎？謗樣夜深，旅客還在哭，當然有些原故，怎麽不問一聲？馬三淡笑道：我常茶房的人，怎取去問人家女客爲什麽哭呢？藍太太將手一拍桌子道：這東西混帳，我說一句，他頂一句。馬三心想，我是樓下茶房，伺候不着你，便答道：我是在樓下當茶房的，樓上的客人，我不管。說着，扭了身子就向外走。藍太太連連的拍着桌子道：回來回來，僅向那　　？僅再　，打斷　　　　。（三一〇）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這樣眞是很費時間的，而且還得有耐性；再有在平常的時候，逢到伊老人家要洗手了，也必須我們去承值，洗過之後，又得同樣的用毛巾給伊拍乾。便是每天晚上伊臉上所搽的那種花液，伊手上也是一般要搽的，這項工作就由當晚輪到值班的女官擔任。</p>
<p>除此以外，太后爲着要求美觀而想就的方法眞不知有多少咧！</p>
<p>其中之一就是每隔十天服食珠子所研成的粉末一次，究竟伊老人家每服一次珠粉需要幾許的珠子，我倒不曾給伊仔細算過，祇知道研珠粉用的珠子都是揀的小珠，一般”是晶圓瑩潤，價值極鉅的眞珠，每次研成的粉末，約有一小茶匙模樣。那茶匙是銀製的，式樣和普通的不同，大約總是專爲太后服食珠粉而定製的。這服食珠粉的一件事；施行已有幾十年之久，從不曾間斷過，差不多已成爲一種固定的章制了；每隔十天，幾乎是在同一個時辰上，那專門負責研磨珠粉的太監便用一幅黃絹托着那柄銀匙，將研就的珠粉獻到太后面前來。</p>
<p>太后也無需再問什麽話，一瞧這人踅進來，便知是該服珠粉的時候到了。（四一〇）</p>

<h3 id="c144">英國沙克島的女王 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>有一座小小的島嶼，自成一國而屬於英帝國的國旗之下，這要算是全世界最奇怪的國家了。統轄這國家的是一位夫人，其國雖小，居然也有國會，不過一年只開三次，當主席的就是俘自已，伊並且享有古代遣傳下來的種種特權。</p>
<p>這島國名呌沙克，Sar坐落在英倫海峽中，而這位女王並沒有王的稱號，只，稱爲一沙克太太」。Dame　of　Sark沙克島的鄰近，有一座白蘭可小島Brecqhou正在標賣，倘有人買了此島，就可取得國會議昌的資格，因爲他不但可以做這島的主人，並能在沙克島的古老的國會中佔得一席·白蘭可島只有一英里的四分之三長，半英里闊，島民共有三人，屋子兩所，田塲一所，彎曲的道路長一英里，汽船停靠的碼頭一座，和漁業上的種種利益，凡是買這島的人在代價每十三金鎊中，必須另出一金鎊，付給「沙克太太，」因爲白蘭可是隷屬於沙克島統轄之下的，這一筆錢是應付的特稅。</p>
<p>「沙克太太」是英帝國中唯一的女領袖，享有全部的行政權。伊除了充任國會主席外，並能蓄養鴿子，開設磨坊或養母狗一頭，這是伊獨享的權利，全島中沒有第二人可以享受的。島中凡有地產出賣，必須得到伊的同意，照例在代價每十三金鎊中抽取一金鎊的特稅。</p>
<p>沙克島中共有田塲四十所，塲主人須納各種　質不同的稅，最奇怪的，有一種稅，按照每一家屋子的窗的多少，將家禽付給「沙克太太」，每一扇窗規定付給家禽一頭，依此類推，島民爲節省起見，那麽只得在屋子上少開幾扇窗子了。</p>
<p>現任的「沙克太太」是一位英國騎兵隊中軍官的寡妻蒲蒙夫人，Mrs.　D.　Beaumont伊的曾祖父柯林氏T.　G.　Collings在一千八百五十二年間購買此島，他老人家去世以後，歸他的媳婦繼承產權，再傳而入於蒲蒙夫人之手。去人最喜旅行，足跡幾遍全世界，因此見多議廣，統轄這一座小沙克島是不算一回事的。夫人有子女六人，將來不知由那一個繼承伊做這沙克島的主人。</p>
<p>沙克島很小，而伊的責任却是不輕，仗着伊的才能，二擔任下來，警如衛生上的設計，學校中的考試，道路的修理，海港的建造，漁業的立法，稅則的制定，道全是島政府的分內事，都由伊一力擔任，親自處理，沒一件不是井井有條的。島中的國會，每年只開三次，都由伊主席，會議全島一切興革事宜。這國會也兼作最高法院之用，民間倘有什麽爭執的事件，最後也得訴之於國會。</p>
<p>英帝國中無論舉行什麽典禮，沙克島也有參加的權利，蒲蒙夫人便以「沙克太太」的名義代表出席，對內外，一身兼之，所以伊也是島中唯一的忙人。</p>
<p>沙克島致敬禮於英王喬治，稱呼很爲特別，因爲它一切都守古制，所以沿用英王舊時的　號瑙門台公爵。Duke　of　Normanday凡是一切奏上英王的文件，全用用法文，稱他爲「我王，我的公爵，」“Re　Roi,Nofre　Duc。”這也是很特別的一回事。沙克島的人民，從不說英國話，他們說的是最純粹的瑙門法國話，據說仍還保留着古代威廉勝王Wiliam　The　Cureueror和他的從臣們的話哩。</p>

<h3 id="c146">本市參加全運會足球昨日試賽六對三藍隊勝白隊 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>足球錦標之誰屬　在目前之第六屆全運會中、確是耐人探究之一個重要問題、由各方收集所得之報告而論、如廣州、香港、北平、全泯華僑以及上海等均抱有同樣熱烈之奪標雄心、上海以地主上關係、尤不能糢視、因此昨日上海市足球隊第一次試賽、即在此項使命之下、而在中園舉行矣、</p>
<p>藍白對抗</p>
<p>試賽與普通比賽不同目的全在觀察球員各個藝術及全體合作、勝負不必計較、往往甲方主體在攻、乙方主體在守、猶如昨日藍隊重於攻取、而白隊專主防守也、藍隊前鋒五將、萬象華、許文壽戴麟經陳家球賈幼良、獨李義臣木興、意者將待諸異日、五將表演、各個尙屬良佳、合作未見純熟、然第一次能如是、已覺非易、推諸未來、當可樂觀、白隊側重防守、守門原定徐亨、因名單中遺漏其名致未出席、由張榮才替代、上半時內衛李寗江善敬、中衛許竟成尙勷梁樹棠、下半時略有史動、前後相較、前者更較可觀、白隊一次在罰球區域綫外受罰、即由李江二術並立球之正面作人牆、二前衛旁立門之左右、或三角綫、守者居門之中央、直令對方踢者射門無路、此種佈置、上海以前所未見、值得爲之一提也、</p>
<p>試賽經過</p>
<p>三時半開賽、混戰多時、藍球中堅馮運佑、半途截下一球、挑送前方、許文奎正面迎得、反身猛射、直入綱窩、繼之戴麟經乘白隊全軍皆出、內城空虛、又輕輕撥入、成二對零、未久、經陳家球之協助、載氏再得一球、此爲藍隊（攻隊）最盛之時代、白隊整理陣脚、加緊防守、前鋒亦屢出攻擊、終由劉祖修奪還一球、上半時以三對一結束、下半時陣綫大動、鐘育祥初爲白隊建功、射中一球、不料梁樹棠種下禍根、被罰十二碼、藍隊陳家球脚不虛發、比數成四對二、最後十分鐘時、藍隊許文奎陳家球各獲一球、白隊劉祖儒亦中一球、結果六對三、藍隊勝、</p>

<h3 id="c165">運輸網上計劃推展與統制 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 吳紹曾</p>
<p>一國之運輸，應有整個的計劃與系統，絕不能以建築若干鐵路公路與開闢若干水路空路，遂爲盡其能事，必其分佈與組織，狀如人體之循　系統，無往不通達，無處不連繫，形成一種運輸網，方克表顯其最大之效能：否則若有割裂之現象，或僅求局部之發展，其直接影響於運輸事業，間接影鄉於國民經濟者，定非淺尠。</p>
<p>顧所謂運輸網，决非某一運輸機關所能單獨造成·蓋運輸網之原素有三：</p>
<p>（一）時間上之緊凑　例如由甲路赴乙路，迨到達甲路終點時，立可搭乘乙路車輛：又如乘鐵路至目的站時，立有公路之汽車，水路之輪船接運以去。在旅客旣無枯坐守候之煩，在貨物亦不致有變易品質或延誤銷售時機之憾，此時間緊凑之效也。</p>
<p>（二）空間上之調劑　例如已有水路者，不另設與水路並行之鐵路，已有鐵路者，不另設與鐵路並行之公路，務使各種交通設備分佈均勻，不至一方感覺客貨擁塞，窮於應付；而一方感覺客貨稀少，空耗資本，此空間調劑之效也。</p>
<p>（三）經濟上之調劑　例如貨物大量而運往遠方者，有火車或海輪爲之裝運：小量而運往近處者，有汽車或內河輪船為之裝運：小量而須迅速遞寄者，又有飛機爲之裝運。旅客亦然，遠者或乘火車，或乘海輪，或乘飛機：近者或乘汽車，或乘內河輸船。其客貨運價，各以適合客商負擔能力爲依歸，俾可考量時間上與費用上之經濟，各遂所適，此經濟調劑之效也。</p>
<p>然欲收運輸上緊凑與調劑之利益，而顯運輸網之效能，惟有二途：一為運輸事業之統制，一爲各項運輸之合作。前者有賴於政府之通盤籌劃，後者即各項運輸本身充分聯絡是也。鐵路爲交通命脈，對於沿綫運輸網之布置，自應盡其一部份之責任，故年來國有各路與水陸空各方舉辦聯絡運輸，着着進行，不遣餘力，有足多者。</p>
<p>惟已往聯運設施，斷不能謂爲已盡其能事，今後有待於改淮推展之處尚多，茲擇述其犖犖大者如下：</p>
<p>（甲）改進鐵路聯運　關於旅客聯運方面應謀改進者，可舉數端如左：</p>
<p>（一）旅客聯運，以時間緊凑一點最關重要。已往各路雖經時刻網會議力謀行車時刻之銜接，顧除滬平通車直渡大江，不成問題外，其他異路車輛聯接之處，尚未能完全緊凑·自宜冉加改進，縱一時不能實現各路聯運客車相互過軌之計劃，亦常籌謀彼此聯運時刻之緊接，使旅客獲得時間上最大之經濟。</p>
<p>（二）美國鐵路有兼營公路者，一方謀鐵路本身之營養，一方亦使旅客獲得接運之便利，我國鐵路如沿綫有闢築公路之需要，而一時無他方承辦者，則鐵路亦未嘗不可投咨興辦。且以鐵路兼營之公路，自與鐵路幹綫作放射形，於布置運輸網一層，尤有裨益。</p>
<p>（三）聯運旅客大率爲長途旅行，照目前運價計算乘車費用，途愈長則費愈鉅，故非有鉅大資產或急要事故者，鮮肯出此·今後爲發展聯運業務計，誠不妨將聯運票價酌予折扣，或予以其他種種便利，以資提倡。</p>
<p>（四）聯運旅客　達聯接站或終點站後，常需寄宿旅館，如其地爲都會或商埠，固無問題；如爲荒僻城鎭，無良好之宿處殊感困苦。故鐵路對於聯運聯接站或終點站之旅館設備，應予注意。苟常地缺乏相當旅館，不妨由鐵路自辦。規模固不必過鉅，其中設備則務求整潔，俾旅客有如歸之樂。</p>
<p>（五）鐵路旅客聯運，除國內各路貫通以外，尚須進一步推諸國外，以期推進國際觀光事業。我國名山勝跡在在都是，亟應廣為宣傳，並設聯運遊覽客車以誘致之，當於鐵路業務及國民經濟，大有裨益，故我國鐵路與外國鐵路或輪船之聯運，亦宜積極籌備者也。</p>
<p>關於便利貨物聯運方面，亦有急待改進者數端：</p>
<p>（一）爲規定貨車行程時間。緣貨物聯運，各路雖已舉辦，而行程日期，尚未規定，貨商運送貨物，每難確計到達日期，致市價高下，無從預測。故宜規定，行程口期，以增貨商之便利，且於鐵路車輛之運用，亦易調度，不致虛麼。</p>
<p>（二）爲訂定大宗貨物聯運之特價，良以各路運輸達宗貨物，均有特價之規定，惟於聯運貨物，訂有特價者，爲數甚少，今後謀布運銷之切實合作，各路亟應擇其大宗出產之貨物，會訂特價，庶供求藉以調劑，物價臻於平衡。</p>
<p>（三）爲統一運費計算。如運費加價成數，負責費成數，各路有加者，有不加者，有加一成者，有加二成者，致運費計算極爲繁複。不獨貨商無以查核，路員對此亦感麻煩，故應化繁為簡，以謀計算便利，而使貨商易於明瞭。</p>
<p>（四）爲裝卸費應與運費一併算收。各路之裝卸費率，各隨其所在地之情形而定，爲數雖微，而繫複異常。現爲權宜之計，裝卸費暫由各路自行徵收。聯運貨物，先付者之卸費，由到達站自行收取；而到付者之裝費，起遝站收取後，尚不能填入貨票之內，僅給雜項收據。是凡貨商繳納聯運貨物之裝卸費，均須於貨票之外，另行給付，旣嫌周折，且易發生浮收之弊。故裝卸費應連同運費同時算收，以免貨商分別支付，而使收貨人祗憑貨憑提貨，不必兼顧繳納裝卸費，必增不少便利也。</p>
<p>（乙）推廣水路公路空路聯運　鐵路與水陸空各方辦理聯運，其旨趣所在，無非爲構成平面式及立體式之運輸網。此項運輸網，自以組織愈密，範圍愈廣，尤足表顯偉大之功能。故今後所有鐵路沿綫之水路及公路，除與鐵路並行者外，均當設法與之聯運。空路方面亦當從運接洽，舉辦聯運；且除旅客及行李包件外，並須仿照歐美各國成例，推及於貨物，使各地名產，均得擴大運銷之範圍，而達供求相應之目的。</p>
<p>（丙）擴充營業所服務範圍　至內地與都市間行李包裹及零擔貨物之聯絡運輸，營業所實爲其樞紐。現在雖有數路已設有營業所，但以地點關係，其服務範圍，仍偏於各大城市，尚未能深入內地城鎭。故今後宜將沿綫各站一律實行營業所化，即凡營業所一切服務事項，均責成各站人員兼辦。除發售客票外，尤注意於行李包裹及零担貨物之往來運送，更須在內地各城鎭遍設營業所代辦處，與當地輪船或汽軍公司密切聯絡。所有內地運出運入之行李包裹及零担貨物，均以低廉費用，代辦起票提貨及劃付欵項一切手續。如此，內地與都市，不營打成一片，於繁榮農村經濟，當不無助力。</p>
<p>抑考一國之運輸，不外鐵路，水路，公路空路四種。顧此四者各有天然之特長，非可等量齊觀。其成本較重，適於長途旅行及大量與易腐貨物之運輸者，火車與海輪是也。成本較輕，適於短途旅行及小量貨物之運輸者，內河小輪與公路汽車是也。速率特高，適於長途急要之旅行及郵件或貴重物品之巡輸者，飛機是也。而除普通客貨運輸，含有經濟上之關係以外，復各負有國防上之一種使命。則以整個國家立塲言，對此四種運輸事業，應謀各個發展其犬然之特長，使之平時可助長國民經濟之繁榮，一日有警，亦可表顯其國防上之效能。致此之道，竊謂有應切實注意者五端：</p>
<p>（一）對於各種運輸事業，謂宜統管理，俾各個之運價與相互之聯絡，俱有統制，以收調整之效，而免偏枯之弊。即不然，其主管運輸之行政聯關，亦應密切甘作，協謀各個運輸平均的發展。</p>
<p>（二）對於各種運輸事業，謂宜施以平等待遇，不助此以敵彼，亦不益彼而損此；否則各個間之競爭，勢必形成尖銳化，而致兩敗俱傷之結果。如美國年來專事援助水路公路，以致鐵路　於衰疲之地步，其　車也。</p>
<p>（三）對於修築鐵路，罰宜只築幹綫，勿修支綫，俾可集中肘力，充分延展鐵路長度，溝通重要地帶；而將支綫之地位，修築公路，俾任短距離之運輸。如此事半功倍，恰符經濟原則。美國鐵路以事前未有通盤計劃，致今公路與鐵路支綫多有衝突之處，兩俱不利，我國自不應再蹈覆幟。</p>
<p>（四）對於修築公路，謂宜與錢路從橫交錯，構成運輸網，力避並行，至少亦宜隔開相當距　；否則彼此起訖相同，中間相隔又甚接近，則不獨引起雙方不利之競爭，即以各個效能言，亦恐無以充分表　也。</p>
<p>（五）關於原始式之運輸器具，謂宜勿存姑息，以免新興運輪事業之發展，受其阻礙。方今世界交通，無不向迅遠與安全之途邁進，我國端應迎　趕上，汰其舊而謀其新。迨新式運輸事業充分發展，即整個國民經濟賴以繁榮，否則因噎廢食，遺患當非淺鮮。</p>
<p>總之，國家各種運輸輸業，應相五聯絡，斷不應相互妨　，應相互策應，斷不應相互背馳。惟能相互聯絡與策應，　能相互營養，其存共榮。我國運輸事業之能否獲最大之發展，顯最大之效能，視此而已！</p>
<p>尤有進者，運輸網之最終日的，在使民衆獲得費　最低而效率最高之運輸服務。顧欲達此日的，除各項運輸事業密切合作外，政府當局又須設法促成其經濟上之平等，使之平均發展其天然之特長。其道有四？各種運輸事業，如其地位重要，無論直接間接，均須予以相當之協助，使之共同進步。一也。各種運輸事業之納稅（或負擔），宜視其資本之多寡與營業之情形，核定公允之稅率。二也。各種運輸之運費，關係民衆負擔，宜按其成本輕重，詳爲釐核，務求允當。二也。對於各種運輸宜規定業務之標準，如設備之應完密整　，手續之應　單迅速，對待旅客之應　恭有禮等，均須符合標準，務使公衆獲最大之舒適與便利。四也。凡此皆與聯絡運輸之發展與效率具有重要關係，亦不容不亟亟注意者也。</p>
<h3 id="c166">無錫四業風潮的前因後果 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>八月杪。無錫的菜　業，米荳業，油廠業及鮮肉業等四業，爲了肥料問題與捐稅問題；先後發生停業請願的風潮。使整個無錫的民食問題，發生嚴重的恐慌。茲將其事實的經過及個中內容的捻討，著文叙述之。</p>
<p>一　事實的節略</p>
<p>（一）菜農業風潮　最近有周祖德，許仁義，黃俠民等十餘人，集資萬元；組織協記農業股份有限公司；於營業部下，復聯合隆順，元大，榮發，生生，福昌，金生，大明，義記，寶興，等昌，德記，惠農，增農，榮興，志發，裕瑞，興華，利農，良益，元噸，浩記，生泰，金記，德盈，華發等二十五家肥料行，組織協記事務所。全縣菜農業以該所壟斷肥料，操從居奇；妨害農業。特於八月二十八日下午，集合各慮菜業農民千餘人，結隊赴縣黨部，縣政府分別請願。要求吊銷行帖，勒令該所解散。復有菜農三百餘人，紛赴協記事務近示威。致發生衝突。二十九日晨。各處菜圃農民，即分別派人駐守五城門口，禁止菜擔進城賣菜，停止交易。三十日，即城外各處菜塲，亦一致停止交易。至此全城菜農。均告停業。</p>
<p>（二）米荳業風潮　本邑米荳業，前奉江蘇財政廳令：向客代征小麥臨時營業稅。該業認爲各粉廠收買小麥，已征統稅，行家賣買小麥，乃係媒介性質：向　代征營業稅，實屬窒碍難行。於上月初，召集全體同業，會商應付辦法；决定函商縣商會，籲請財政部迅飭江蘇財政廳收回征收小麥臨時營業稅之成命。財政部據呈；以牙行代征營業稅，係向賣主征收；與統稅無關。批駁不准！該業迭次申請；爭持不决。於是於八月二十九日，該業一百三十餘糧行！代表五百餘人。赴縣政府請願。聞倘無結果，亦將以停業對付。</p>
<p>（三）油廠業風潮　廣東省政府因征收全國進口餅類附加稅，爲中山大學建築經費。每擔征收二角五分，定於九月一日實行。致引起國內上海，漢口，無錫，常州，崑山等各地油餅雜糧業的劇烈反對。除推派代表在滬開會，組織請願團分向中央及西南政府請願據理力爭外；同時全國油廠業，於八月三十一日一致停工。無錫的恒德與潤豐二家油廠，已於八月三十一日停工。</p>
<p>（四）鮮肉業風潮　無錫的屠宰稅征收所，因於去年九九月一日至本年八月底止，由肉業公會常務委員陸宗儀等五人包額承辦；當因稅額問題，幾經週折。嗣巾縣商會從中仲裁，備函證明；　告决定。但於解欵方面，時有拖欠；致積欠稅欵巨萬；各鄉稅欵，因之大受影響。幾度交涉，後經征收所呈報縣政府；由縣令限期將稅欵繳出。征收所方面，以稅欵若不予以整頓，則前途勢必不堪設想；遂决於九月一日起，實行點隻征收。公布點征辦法。在鮮肉業方面，認爲以所欠稅欽，已山縣令限繳在案。毋庸變更征收辦法。爲表示反對起見，特於九月一日起，全縣鮮肉業一律停止營業。</p>
<p>以上四業風潮的經濟病態，我們把他分析在下面。</p>
<p>二　菜農業風潮</p>
<p>先論菜農業。菜農業停業的遠因，是起端於一個政治原因的衛生問題。我們試讀無錫自治第一區區長批答菜農業的原文；便可瞭然」斑。</p>
<p>「…（一）政府取締坑厠，其目的因街巷間坑厠漫無限制。旣不合公共衛生；復於市政觀膽有碍。因取締其過剩者，而保存其適量之厠。幷非遇有坑厠，一律加以填塞…。」</p>
<p>無錫的坑厠，眞所謂無街無坑；無巷無厠。民間未嘗不知有害衛生；官廳未嘗不知有碍觀瞻。祇以習俗深囿，無從改善而已！但是行政的力量，民間是隨着歷史而增减的。黨化政治在無錫，已較任何的軍閥政治爲長久。坑厠的取締，亦已非止一次。因爲取締的結果，往往總是書虎不成；最大的問題，便是排洩物設有妥善的辦法。這一次聰　的官廳，在事　雖然沒有將妥善處置的辦法公布；但就事勢擴大後業農具呈區公所的呈文中沂來，便能所瞭官廳在事前的佈置了。</p>
<p>「……吾邑鄉農，向日採用肥料；　自山購買，返鄉施用。聞有投行委托牙主代買者：相沿迄今，亦亳無妨害。近有協記事務所者，同時關向縣政府領得榮發等牙帖二十五紙。一而取締私有坑厠；一面公然登報宣。……」</p>
<p>肥料行的組織，本來須先向當地主管官署領取牙行的牙帖；然後始可營業。查無錫肥料行的牙帖，據該地報紙的調查：原有牙帖十三張，嗣後牙行陸續閉歇：迄今僅存牙帖八張。此次因爲協記事務所的組織，同時　然向縣政府領得新貼十八張。連同舊帖共訓二十六張。中「同時　然領帖」的專實上觀　；就不難描寫出官　事前的佈置了。那末協記事務所，不過是一個引起風潮近因的焦　而已。</p>
<p>三　米荳業風潮</p>
<p>次論米荳業，無錫米荳業此次請願的風潮，純粹是一個政治原因的租稅問題。這個問題的主因，可謂全是米荳業本身經濟病態的反映。在這個問題未解决以前，我們先來討論小麥營業稅是否應向牙行征收。在以前，江蘇省政府對於征收營業稅的意見；他們對於已經征納出廠稅之麥粉，如粉廠分設事務所於在內地收買小麥；省政府便認爲交易行爲。其實粉廠派人收取小麥，非爲出售；乃爲　製麥粉。兩種手續，僅爲一個營業的兩段。收買小麥爲前一部份，製粉出廠爲後一部份。中央旣征其一，地方不得復征其他。嗣經財政部規定免征辦法，此種糾紛始告解决。但是糧行賣買小麥，不能視同一例；因爲他一面收買，一面出賣。即使代粉廠收買，居問必然抽取佣金。這種行為，顯然是兩個交易行爲。與粉廠派員收買的一個營業行爲的兩段；當然是不對了。那末；無錫米荳業明知是兩個交易行爲，爲何而發生結隊請願的風潮呢？他的苦衷，不難可以明瞭。因爲米荳業自審自己的經濟病態的內在原因；此時此地，是絕然不堪負擔這種合法的捐稅的。假設米荳業沒有內在的經濟的病態；或許這次請願的風潮，是全然不會發生的。試觀今年無錫的米市，爲自有米市以來從未遭遇之不景氣。洋米存積；米價步跌。預測今年年底，全縣米業勢必整個的收縮。這種內在的原因，正在希望政府扶植。却不料　漏更遭大雨，使此種合法的捐稅；變成此時此地擾民困商的苛政了。</p>
<p>四　油廠業風潮</p>
<p>無錫油廠此次的停業；係全受畸形政治的原因所激動。此番風潮，已波及全國，在無錫的農民亦是非常的注意；因爲油餅是壅田飼猪的原料。與農業的生產上是息息相關的，從各地同業公會先後拍發之電文覜察；發現此種捐稅是不應該的理由。可是在官廳方面，似乎還沒有知道；即使知道，似乎也只知其然；不知其所以！然明明是祇征舶來品肥料的捐稅，怎樣將國產的土貨亦强拉入一起。因此；此番油廠業風潮的經濟病態，便是政治不統一的反映。</p>
<p>五　鮮肉業風潮</p>
<p>末論鮮肉業的停業。更是以說明農料破產與物價低落的內在原因。無錫鮮肉的市價，每元可購七斤。農民以育猪無利可圖，紛紛將所有豬仔向都市運來；以求早日出售。於是鮮肉供過於求；市價益疲。鮮肉誧爲欲脫售現貨起見，盡量用賒帳方法推銷肉貨。致現金短絀；週轉不靈，所欠的屠宰稅欵，無從繳納。屠宰稅的征收所爲要維持他們的稅收起見，於是祇有點隻征稅一法來救濟。但在鮮肉業方面，勢必有二點苦衷難以解决。</p>
<p>（一）點隻征收稅，欺勢必逐日繳納；沒有拖欠的通融。但在此不景氣的鮮肉業，於財力上未必能勝任。</p>
<p>（二）以前稍欠的屠宰稅，便發生淸償上的困難。</p>
<p>像有上面這兩重的國難問題；便有停業反對的表示了。</p>
<p>六　結論</p>

<p>脈之動，全由於心之動，心之動，爲一收縮一擴張，收縮之時，存乎心室中之血，被逼而迸出，而入於脈中，脈乃爲之膨脹，同時脈內之血，乃爲之前進，此卽脈動之眞理也。心不動，脈亦不動，心幾動，脈亦幾動，不但兩手寸口動脈如此，全身動脈，無不如此，凡耳前動脈，足背動脈，頸動脈等，可以手按而得者，皆可按以實騐。然心力衰弱甚者，心一收縮，所輸出之血量甚少，不足以使脈管作明著之膨脹，則無脈可按矣。故有心動而脈不動者，（新醫謂之無脈波性收縮。）未有心不動而脈能自動者也，是故脈之代結，無他，乃心之代結耳，實心動有中止故也，心何以動，以有刺戟故也。心臟受刺戟，何以能收縮，蓋肌肉之爲物，一受刺戟，皆能收縮，心臟亦肌肉所組成，故亦受刺戟而收縮也。心動何以中止，以刺戟發生異常，或傳達其刺戟之徑路，發生妨礙也。心者，藐小一物耳，刺戟之，宜可全心受其影響，何以必須有傳達徑路，蓋心之爲物，分上下兩截，在上者爲左右心房，在下者爲左右心室，房室皆肌肉，而中有織締組織隔之，各自獨立，不相連屬也，故須有傳達之器，然後一方受刺戟，能傳至他方也。今知心臟之刺戟，發自靜脈竇，在右心上半，卽右心房之靜脈血入口之附近也，此處受刺戟，經傳達徑路而至心室，故心房收縮後，卽見心室收縮也，心室收縮，始能令血迸出，故脈之動，全賴乎心室之收縮，而心臟之收縮，全在乎刺戟也。此外又有一特異狀態，不可不明者。當心臟收縮期及擴張之初期，若再有外來之刺戟，加於心臟，此時心臟不再發生影響，故亦不別起收縮，此謂之「刺戟無反應期，」此現象，與代結之說明，有極大之關係也。</p>
<p>心臟本來之刺戟，發自靜脈寶近傍者，有一定不變之期限，故心之一收一放，亦井然不亂，今有特別之刺戟，發生於心室，不隨定期，又不在無反應期之內，則心臟受彼刺戟，又起收縮，而脈又一至，此一收縮，與前次之正常收縮，相距之時間較短，故其脈爲連來兩至，期外收縮之後，正常之刺戟又至，若適在無反應期中，心臟卽不受影響，故不能引起收縮，必待下次之正常刺戟，始能收縮，故休息之時間較長，而其脈爲中止矣。概而言之，則其脈如「連來兩至而略止」也。舊謂結脈之能自還，爲「略止而連來兩至，「誤矣，若一次正常收縮，一次期外收縮，交互而至者，則似「略止而連來兩至，」然其本體，亦不過「連來兩至而略止」耳。舊蓋顚倒其先後也，由些言之，舊以中止而能自還者爲結脈，卽今之心室性期外收縮也。然若當期外收縮之來，若此時心室內收容之血液，爲量尚甚少之時，則心雖收縮，而迸出之血量，不足以使動脈作明顯之膨脹，而成爲上文所述之無脈波性收縮，而其後之正常收縮，又被無反應期所湮沒，必待下次正常收縮時，始能見脈，則無脈之時間更長矣。以其無連來兩至之現象，故按之似覺較常脈直少一脈矣，舊謂之不能自還，謂之代脈，實則脈雖如此，而聽其心部，固顯然有期外收縮之音可證明也。舊以中止之脈，能自還不能自還，分結代而卜吉凶，熟知徒切脈而不知聽心，心雖能自還，而脈有如不能自還者乎，是則舊醫論脈者，所夢想不到者矣。</p>
<p>房室刺戟傳達障碍者，由心房傳至心室之路徑，發達障碍也，其證之輕者，自心房傳至心室之機能，不甚敏活，而傳達之時間，爲之延長，故心臟每收縮之距離，漸漸延長，至一定程度，心房傳來之刺戟，心室不起反應，此時脈搏卽中止，而脫漏一至矣，中止須臾，其傳達之機能，恢復原狀，於是收縮之距離，暫時縮短幾許，乃又漸漸延長，復至於不起反應而止，故有此證之脈來必緩，與仲景「按之來緩」合，中止而後，更來之脈，較數於前，此亦所謂自還也，亦與仲景所說結陰之脈合，故房室刺戟傳達障碍，亦卽仲景之結脈也。（其詳可參看皇漢醫學批評。　（傷寒發揮五完）</p>

<p>（六十七）喉癆和喉梅毒</p>
<p>（問）什麽叫做喉癆？</p>
<p>（答）是喉頭績發於肺結核（肺癆）的結核病；原發的喉癆，却很少。</p>
<p>（問）喉癆發生的初時，現什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）病人有頑固不治的嗄聲，咳嗽和咯痰。</p>
<p>（問）後來怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）訴喉痛，嚥下時疼痛更劇；喉內起潰瘍，若潰瘍在披裂軟骨部，疼痛放散於耳中；若潰瘍在咽前壁和會厭軟骨部，則疼痛，在嚥下時發生。</p>
<p>（問）喉癆的病人，講話時有異樣嗎？</p>
<p>（答）講話時聲音變化；起潰瘍之後，就此「失音。」</p>
<p>（問）患喉癆的時侯，同時可有他症合併？</p>
<p>（答）往往併發聲門水腫和喉軟骨炎。</p>
<p>（問）疹斷的時候，應該和那幾種喉病相區別？</p>
<p>（答）聘當和喉梅毒和喉癌相鑑別。</p>
<p>（問）患了喉癆，前途吉兇如何？</p>
<p>（答）大都不治。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣治療呢？</p>
<p>（答）第一要禁止病人談話吸烟；講究全身營養。</p>
<p>（問）喉頭局部用什麼藥品？</p>
<p>（答）喉部塗布薄荷油（百分之二十）或乳酸溶液（百分之二十五至三十）疼痛的時侯，可用科卡因液塗布。</p>
<p>（問）可有內服的藥品？</p>
<p>（答）內服鈣劑式克列鎖劑。注射葡萄糖酸鈣。</p>
<p>（問）若病人因喉腫而致呼吸困難時，應當怎樣。</p>
<p>（答）不得不行氣管切開術。</p>
<p>（問）什麽叫做喉梅毒？</p>
<p>（答）就是在梅毒第二期的時候，喉內發生扁平　疣，因而致結膜炎衝　　　紅，甚至聲門水腫。或在第三期的時候，在喉內披裂秋骨和聲帶部構成膠皮腫，破壞組織而成潰瘍。這就叫喉梅毒。</p>
<p>（問）喉梅毒的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）化像喉結核一樣，起聲音嘶啞和嚥下困難。</p>
<p>（問）患喉梅毒的時侯，也有合併症嗎？</p>
<p>（答）往往合併喉軟骨膜炎和聲門水腫。</p>
<p>（問）診斷候梅毒的時候，應當和那幾種病相區別？</p>
<p>（答）應當和喉結核及癌腫相區別。</p>
<p>（問）喉結核的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）不外施以驅梅療法，就是六〇六，九一四，汞劑，鉍劑等的注射，碘劑的內服等。</p>
<h3 id="c178">高血壓與血管硬化（下） <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之九—</p>
<p>另外還有一個假定，是以這麽一個通曉的事實爲根據的，就是：患高血壓的人，腎臟發生十分明確的變化。於是有人設想：因爲，在這樣的情狀之下，腎臟不把體內一切廢物排除，所以某種留在在血液中的廢物藉使血管收縮在全身活動。可是，發見具有此種性質的任何體內廢物，卻是很困難的。著名的偷敦醫生勃替簫（Batty-Shaw）曾於若干年前堅决地說，能使血管收縮的滋養料中間產物是沒有的。但梅霞（Major）却在不久以前發見，因蛋白質食物碎裂而成的Guanidine　Guanidine中含有此種質料。</p>
<p>梅霞又發見，用肝臟抽出物注射，可以减低血壓，其效力且達長久的時期。此項發見所根據的理論是這樣：我們知道，肝臟是與尿酸的產生有關的。尿酸大概是藉肝臟從若干如「加尼丁」（Guanidine）之類的　間產物造成的。爲了某種原因，肝臟不能從這些產物造成尿酸，於是它們照舊在血液中循環。我們知道，它們會使血壓增高的。血液中的肝臟抽出物會使它們綜合而成無毒的尿酸，因此，增高血壓的質料曁從血液中排除，血液也就低落了，</p>
<p>可是，對於此項假定，富於診斷經騐的醫生會起來辯駁說：假如「加尼丁」是高血壓的原因，那麽爲什麽「加尼丁」只在五六十歲時纔開始活動？又，假如這是因牙齒不良而起，則一部分人們年靑時早已牙齒不良，而高血壓則必須到了五六十歲纔起。</p>
<p>一般人說，高血壓是一種遺傳症。在平常人看來，對於此種觀察醫生們是不必費多大心思的。其實，恰好相反，爲了各種原因，這是最難達到的經論之一。試想：任何醫生本身只活一世；田此他難得獲得觀察兩親與兒童在同年　的疾病。固然，，病人會把兩親的病狀及致死的原因告訴他：但對於這樣的叙述，醫生是頗難相信的！一半因爲他不相信病人所叙述的自己的症狀，一半因爲病人對於兩親的疾病常坦白表示懷疑。而且，現代的醫生對於生物學在關於遺傳方面所得的結論並不完全表示同意</p>
<p>只有一種假定，是和一切情狀相合的，因爲它和關於「創始」的最新的結論相適應。這假定就是：原形質具有一種傾向，就是到了個體生命的某時期，某種身體細胞！如大動脈，血等膜，及腎臟的微血管籍等！會發生某種變化。在此種假定之下，我們可以推知，高血壓與血管硬化只是人體裏老的一種生理學法則。</p>
<p>就關於治療方面而說，唯一有價值的處置是藉减少加於血管的壓力以調整一般的壽命。這樣，壽命確實可以延長若干年。但所謂减少血管的壓力，並不是指世上一切活動應該停頓而言。藉血</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>壓低落的記錄以測量人類生活的改進，或設想這是可能的事，乃是絕大的錯誤。一部分醫生曾替人壽保險公司歷年測量當事人的血壓。這是一種沈悶而且單調的職業。但他們也從此獲得幾種益處。一種是他們學知什麽情狀可受治療的的影響，什麽情狀不受形響。就一般人而說，高血壓與血管硬化是難得治療的。在紐約，在芝加哥，在維也納，在柏林，在巴黎，在倫敦，治療高血壓與血管硬化的種種方法都被試騐過，但無一見效。</p>
<p>總之，血壓的變化無關於健康。血壓較高者不一定比血壓較低者弱。血壓高不是疾病，只是一種生理的調整。克林登甯在『人體」中發表一段有趣味的忠告說：</p>
<p>「過了五十歲年紀的人，最好不讓他知道他的血壓記錄，因爲這是會引起不愉快的消息。你們別放棄你們的工作，你們的娛樂，或者，就女性說，別放棄你們的參政運動。生命是爲生活，爲圓滿的快樂與活動，而設的。你們切莫把恐懼的眼光注視玻璃管中搖動着的水銀讓生命的火燄不自然地熄滅。」</p>

<p>第十二章　肺結核之治療</p>
<p>肺結核果可痊愈耶？</p>
<p>一提到肺結核治療，我想大家一定要問：究竟肺結核症能不能痊愈呢？這一個問題，當然是千頭萬緒，不很容易答覆的，但是事實上的種種根據，無疑地是傾向肯定一方面的。我們要曉得，在尋常肺結核患者中，甚至痰中已發現結核菌者，到後來完全告愈並不重行發作的例子，在臨床上是屢見不鮮的。復次，在病理解剖方面，也有很多明顯之證據的。尋常因其他疾病而死之屍體；往往於其肺尖；發見舊結核病灶瘢痕；在曾陷乾酪化之氣管枝腺體裏面，也有石灰狀遺物之存在的；這都足以證明肺結核之痊愈，，是沒有疑問的。此種經過良好之結核病，在他的病灶周圍，纖維性結締組織是產生特盛的；至於乾酪化的物質，則被其封鎖，以阻止結核菌之散播。縱維性結締組織產生愈盛，乾酪化的物質是被封鎖愈牢固的。結果狹小的病灶，大半係有完全治愈之可能的。但是此種被封鎖包圍的病灶，假使一有時機，很可引起本症之再發的。此種再發狀態，雖未必定佔大多數，但可能性則每個病者都是有的。時間更不一定，就是十數年以上的舊病灶，也是一樣待遇的；甚至此處的病灶雖在痊愈狀態了，他處也可另行發生的。所以肺結核症之痊愈與否，是沒有什麽問題的：但到了何種程度，就可說不會再發，這一個問題，是沒有一個人能夠答覆的。</p>

<p>頭痛</p>
<p>頭痛是一種很平常的毛病，有的是時常頭痛，有的是偶然頭痛，因爲是一種極平常的毛病所以靠製造與販賣頭痛　生活的人也不知有多少。在科學醫以前時代人們有了頭痛，祗要聽人家講這種藥或某種藥有止頭痛的效力，就去服用，完全不問問爲什麽頭痛？或止頭痛藥是怎樣的作用？不但是病家如此就是號稱醫家的也是如此。其根本錯誤爲：第一不曉得爲什麽頭痛，第二不曉得止痛藥的作用。現在是科學昌明的時代，對於無論什麽病我們都要先明白是什麽原因，我們也要曉得服的藥是什麼化學成分，並且在身內有什麼作用，怎樣進入身內怎樣排洩出去。這樣我們一可預防頭痛，二可用適當的方法或根本的方法治療。茲略述頭痛的原因與治療的原理：</p>
<p>攏統講起來頭痛是有原因的，若是沒有原因頭不會痛。頭痛的原因很多，所以各種的頭痛不能用一樣的治法。反過來說就是一樣的治法不能治好一切的頭痛，假設能，也不過是一種敷衍的方法或是一種麻醉作用，並不是一種根本辦法。</p>

<h3 id="c183">創作方法的分水嶺 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 芷英</p>
<p>比蘭台羅（LuigiPirandel'o）最近在紐約對記者說，他的創作是從他腦子裏產生出來的，在他的這一句話裏，實在包含着一個非常重要的問題：藝衛　際上是孤獨地從「腦子」裏產生出來的呢，還是只是經過腦子的加工而產生出來的？</p>
<p>藝衛的創造，不消說須要想像甚至「幻想」。如果沒有作家的「腦子」的活動，世界上還會有藝術這東西麽？然而，問題的關鍵就正在這襄。我們的腦子，是自動會憑空造出一些事象來呢，還是只是一種高級的物質構造，由於現實事象的影響，刺戟，而產生出一種反映這些現實的事象，或與它保持着關聯的想像呢？</p>
<p>對於這個間題，近代哲學已給我們以明確的解答。人類的腦子，人類的原惟，都是受其現實境遇的刺戟，反映它，表現它的。</p>
<p>那麽，比蘭台羅的話，是不對的麽？比蘭台羅的藝術，是現實的反映麽？</p>
<p>其實，比蘭臺羅的話，作爲他的藝術創作方法的標識，是不會全然不對的。而他的藝術，也不是現實的反映；這並不和我們上面的解釋相矛盾。</p>
<p>原來在藝衛的創作方法上，有着兩種主要的不同的傾向：一種是現實主義的（Realitic），一種是觀念主義的（Idealistic）。這彷彿像哲學史的洪流的「分水嶺」，分爲物觀論和觀念論一樣。不過實際上現實主義與物觀論，觀念主養與觀念論，雖各保持着密切的關係，但並不是全然同一的，</p>
<p>觀念主義的作家，主張以主觀去代替客觀。他們以爲一切的主觀，都是正確地反映着現實的，因之作家要忠實現實，就必須儘量大膽地表現他的主觀。凡主觀所表現的一切，都是「現實的」。主觀創造一切。</p>
<p>王爾德在他的「虛偽的消滅」裏說：「藝衛，比模做生活更多自然模倣風景畫家，從風景畫家偕去他的効果。我們看到濃霧，遮住了眼和光，把屋宇變成一種怪物的鏈鎖，往來蠕動，這種可驚的濃霧，如果我們不是從印象主義者借來的，究竟是向誰借來的呢？我們還看到彌銀色的霧，以洗鍊的透明，罩着變成弧形的橋，罩着搖盪的小船，在河上搖拽，這銀色的霧，如果我們不是從印象主義的指導者（莫納哀）得來的，究竟從誰得來的呢？倫敦的氣候，在最近十年間所起的可驚的變化，顯然地是這獨得的藝術流派所完成的。你們在笑麽？請從科學的或形而上學的觀點來看看，你們使會相信我是正確的。那未，自然是什麽？自然不是產生我們的偉大的母親，自然是我們的意識，自然只生存在我們的腦子裏。事物的存在是因爲我們看見它。我們看見什麽，爲什麽看見——這是依存於影響我們的藝術上。現在人們看見霧，並非因爲霧是存在，而是詩人和畫家把那種効果的玄妙的美，顯示給人類的緣故。霧在藝衛沒有把它發明出來以前，是不存在的」</p>
<p>這些話都是句句「言之有物」，所以　抄了一大段。對於這些意見，我們似乎不必再在這裏多花篇幅了。只是我們有一個疑問在這裏：照這麼說，藝術家又是「依從什麽而存在的呢？王爾德自己如果能够完滿地證明他不是從母胎裏呱呱墮地的，而是「依從」什麽「東西」而生存的，那末我們也許可以相信他的話。</p>
<p>這裏我們看到到觀念主義的一種傾向：使現實的一切「依從」於自己的主觀，「依從」於自己的藝衛。在這種意義上，比蘭台羅說他的創作是從腦午裏生出來的並不會不對。因爲比蘭臺羅也是這樣的一位觀念主義作家，而我們說他們的藝衛不是反映現實的，也沒有錯誤，因爲他們不在表現現實，而在表現「主觀」，他們的藝術不能造出活生生的現實的形象，而只是一種「觀念的遊覷」，一種「言語的魔衛」。</p>
<p>所請「主觀」，是現實的生活環境製造出來的，但如果因此說凡忠實於「主觀」，就是忠實地表現了複雜的生活環境，這不用說是太過於武斷的疎忽。正是因爲主觀是社會生活的條件所造成的，所以在矛盾，分裂的社會生活的條件下，有一種「主觀」是代表着統，一這矛盾，分裂的社會關係，使其達到更高的發展的現實的要紫；又有一種「主觀」，代表着與這相反的一些現實的沒落要素。前一種「主觀」自己並不高唱絕對的獨立，它時常結附着現實的發展的要素，因爲它的創作方法是現實主義的。後一種「主觀」，雖然也是現實的沒落的要素的表現，但它並不敢如實地裘現它的沒落的現實，更不會表現發展的現實，否則它早已不存在了。這種「主觀」，就作爲沒落的現實要素的一現象，躲進自己狹隘的「主觀」裏，造出一些歪曲現實的東西來。</p>
<p>這兩種不同的主觀，就是藝術創作方法上的分水嶺。它們同是從親實出來的，但一個會表現現實，一個會歪曲現實。像王爾德，比蘭台羅之流的人，口口聲聲在擁護主觀，結果反而是殘殺了主觀，因爲他們把主觀當做辯護罪惡的符咒，當作一種空虛的廢料；而不把它當做一種實踐的能動的力量，一種吻合現實的發展，擁護現實的力量。</p>

<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>在懷遠敎書時，上完一天課，人是有點疲倦了。城內是找不到散散沉悶的地方的。吃過晚飯，常是和楫，鴻兩個兒上淮河的水濱去。</p>
<p>是夕陽落過的黃昏了。</p>
<p>三個兒輕快的履聲，瑟瑟地從綠蔭的石屑鋪砌的汽車路上走過去。且談，且走，凉快的晚風，從兩邊的麥田裏流到身上，一天的疲倦讓晚風帶走。鴻常曾與奮的哼一個歌；或者作一聲怪叫「喔—」，聽四周山間的回聲撞回來，也應聲着「喔—」。</p>
<p>一條滔滔的長流就橫在我們眼前了。淡淡的月光映着水上銀色的波浪，我愛聽「洶洶潺潺」的水聲，一種偉大和平的天然音樂，會擊動靈魂裏博大的愛，給我一片坦蕩闊大的心境。</p>
<p>跟楫與鴻，一起坐下來，坐在水濱外國牧師砌的輸碼頭的石級上。</p>
<p>脚下水流滔滔打着浪，向下遊奔着奔着，遙望兩岸峙立着的山峯，山峯挺着副靜穆肅然的姿容。月亮擁着雲，從山頂上灑下一片銀色的光。</p>
<p>這境界裏，我爽快的吐着氣，從心角裏憶起兩句詩來。。</p>
<p>——山隨平埜，江入大荒流。</p>
<p>披着銀自的月光，趁着河上捲起的凉風，我們走下石級去，沿着淮水的淺灘走過去。洶洶的水流在我脚邊滾奔着，湧起的浪，水沫濺到脚背上。朦朧的水上遠遠亮着一點兩點紅燈光，夜班輸船拖着七八條大船破浪衝過來了。船過，水浪擊起千萬條金蛇；聽一　悠長的汽笛從山壁上撞下來的回響。</p>
<p>我愛淮濱的黃昏，展開一片壯美的夜景。</p>
<h3 id="c186">談「橘」 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>「行沙渡水到山隈，</p>
<p>剡棘層枝遶屋栽。</p>
<p>紛有文章圓果熟，</p>
<p>此中佳味自天來。」</p>
<p>這是我十年以前做的一首小　，發在羅　芷先，主編，長沙出版的一種小品文刊物，名呌「零星」的上面。那個時候，我正在潮南省立第一師範和長沙縣立師範敎書，黑芷問我移居什麽地方，我就寫了這首小詩給他。黑芷笑對我說：「你的詩並不好，倒是你住的地方好。」我也笑對他說：「我所以穿洲渡水的移居　麓山下，正因爲那裏有一年常綠的橘樹繞着屋子，麓山紅橘可以從晚秋吃到初春喱！」</p>
<p>從長沙南鬥出城，渡河，穿過水陸洲，便到嶽麓由下，　河靠山一帶地方都是橘園，水陸洲古時呌做橘洲，正因爲種橘得名。杜甫的嶽麓山道林二寺詩，有句說，「橋洲田土仍膏腴，」因爲洲上的田土肥沃，所以產出的橘子又大又甜。據與地志說：「潭州橘洲在郡南對南津，常看如在下，及至夏水懷山，洲渚皆沒，稱洲獨在。」古人以爲橘洲能够隨水漲落，那就未免是近於神話了。</p>
<p>我們知道橘樹是湖南特產的一種，從古就有名的。屈原的橘頌道：「后　嘉樹，橘徠服兮。受命不遷，生南　兮。」好像是說；皇天后土特命橘樹生在這個南國。固然屈原所說的南國並不一定就是指的湖南，但是湖南在那個時候是楚國的一部，也恰好是在楚國的南方，却是事實。橘頌又說：「深固難徒，更護兮。緣葉素榮，紛其可喜兮。曾枝剡棘，圓東搏兮。靑黃雜糅，文章爛兮。精色內白，類可任道兮。紛縕宜修，姱而不醜兮。」屈原把橘樹人格化，說他有三種美德，一是志氣堅定，二是文章絢爛，三是本質不醜，其實屈原自己正要拿橋樹來象徵他自已的人格，所以他的橋頌無異乎自頌了。</p>
<p>橘樹在植物學上屬芸香科，常綠灌木，幹高一丈上下，枝很茂密有刺，葉作長卵形，葉端尖的，葉柄有冀狀小片。夏開五瓣自花，略和葉莉相似，香氣撲鼻。霜降以後，所結的扁圓果實成熟，皮色發紅，纔可以吃。王右軍帖說：「奉橘三百顆，霜未降，未可多得。」原來橋不見霜，皮不紅，那是不好吃的。韋應物有詩句說：「書後欲題三百顆，洞庭須待滿林霜。」正是用的王右軍帖裏那個典故。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c187">中年 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>近來不斷地受着秋的感觸，連帶地引起了中年的威觸。照習慣把四時擬喻人的人在，中年是近於夏的，然而我們似不易見到夏一樣的中年，多數人一到中年，就已老氣橫秋，而以後的生活，永遠依樣機續下去。說好呢，這大概是理智長足，認識已經確定，說不好，則縱把生命力的衰退，政途的彷徨等不幸擱起不說，姑承認其確能在中年找到一安身立命正當方法，可也就與迷信者的生活相差無幾。</p>
<p>我們常聽人說什麽中年感慨，但所謂感慨，怕都只是些無威之感，或者是過去的感慨的回憶。眞正的少年時代的感傷，是不再有了。從種種理論上，我們知道感傷的消除的必然與必要，但這裏必然的過程，與必要的條件，殊未必能有一致的解釋。希望春天早點暖，秋天早點凉的人情，往往和實際季節變化相反背。我們的感傷性是不是消逝得太快，又誰能知道呢？，</p>
<p>是不是每個人都會經過一段感傷的年齡？這似無法知道，幷且若時代是一個不應感傷的時代，則個人的感傷，原無足輕重。可是萬一這時代充滿了感傷的人，徒勉强忍受了時代的壓迫，竭力掩飾其感傷，可不是會形成一極大的虛偽。雖然不自然的進展，也未嘗不是一種進展，也未嘗不會漸轉爲自然，但怕也不能不擔心一個空壳的破裂。</p>
<p>不想了，還是縮小到個人吧？「立」和『不惑」的境界，誠然頗像是圓滿，可惜旣有方法臨範本樣地完成，則所成就的價值就至不一律。所具的弱點在中年或不致立卽現露，但一近衰老，就不是陷於固執，就是傾入搖落，這兩種被視爲衰老的特徵，實在都是中年所深伏下的。這情太習見了，使我們每以爲自然應該如此，决不想這可以早點在中年覺察。雖然所謂中年感慨，常也就是夏衰老的日近，但同時往往是又信自己是在很可自信的中年，只要把中年的自己握固，衰老還不致立時就來。這可不正是周執與迷亂。</p>
<p>人對於自己中年的感覺，實在沒有他對於秋天的感覺淸楚。到底秋天是屬於身外的。固然身外與身內該有多少不同，但如以爲人生是一個較長的時期，更引伸出去却不行，我們無甯信季節是更永恒的現象。我們能了解秋的複雜，或者我們的中年，也不致於十分單調。</p>
<p>但可憐到底已是中年的秋天了，心境上也不很覺得秋意的蕭條，也不很欣賞秋意的嚴肅，實在怕已來了更早的衰老呢。</p>

<p>小和尚也打邊鼓：『那個板好玩哩！』</p>
<p>冷不防媽媽却對他們一聲：「呸！」拖他們走：「那會跌斷腿的！」</p>
<p>小毛頭掙脫手，扭着身子哼：「　……！」小和尚跑回門邊去看，抓住欄柵不放手。裏面那塊板蹺來蹺去，高架上爬上滑下，人家襲成一片，笑成一片。沒有誰來理他們。</p>
<p>「桂花庵那塊才好玩裏！走吧！那塊有——」</p>

<p>背後一陳嚷，一陣笑小，小和尚只覺得身子一隈鬆，一陣沉的，背後「通」的一聲響，小和尚的腿也不由得挺一挺。</p>
<p>左一轉，右一轉，聲音聽不見了，白粉牆也沒有了，孩子跟在媽媽背後走。</p>
<p>路上人多起來了，女人們提着香，小燈籠，黃布袋，三個一簇五個一堆地說着走着。再轉一個灣，便看見一座塗着黃粉的照壁。照壁對面一座廟。人像螞蟻機擠在廟前面。嘈嘈雜雜的聲音混成一片海，聽不出一個靑紅皂白。只有小糖鑼鐺兒鐺的，竹梆子獨兒獨的　在這一片聲音之上。他們邊聽得出那鐸兒鐸的一個竹梆子是爸爸的。廟門裏黑漆一團，只見一陣陣濃濃的靑煙朝外冒，在屋頂上慢慢地飛散。</p>
<p>漸漸走進人堆裏，媽媽我到爸爸的担子。爸爸正忙哩。，一邊盛着粥，一邊收着錢，一邊要洗碗，抽空還敲兩下竹梆子。担子四邊擠滿了人，爸爸像照應不來。媽媽要幫忙，爸爸推開她：「你去燒你的番！」</p>
<p>三個人擠進廟門，迎面撲過一陣煙來，眼淚都迷出來了。院子裏一隻大錢，裏面燒着成十成百的小燈籠，火頭留有兩尺來高。烤得人淌汗。一隻小裏燒着整股整封香，臘燭也丟在裏邊燒着。煙像霍彩，對面看不見人：臘油的味道嗆得人發嘔。女人們唸着：「阿彌陀佛，」銅板丟進錢籠裏的聲音格郎郎地響。</p>
<p>媽媽磕着頭，　告着鬼話。捺着孩子也磕頭。小和尚先就逃回院子裏。他呌：『走吧！不好玩。」媽媽沒奈何，牽着小毛頭也走出來。可是她攪昏了，連　薩還沒看一眼哩！回過頭去，又給煙迷住，只得又禱告了兩句鬼話，這才走出了廟門。</p>

<p>— 順</p>
<p>大操</p>
<p>大換是一種武裝示威行動，與外交手段無關，外交手段是以非武力手腕來解决國際間糾紛的局面，故叫外交手段，但是外交手段而不是用武力來做後盾，無論你手段如何靈活，必不能發生若何效果，這是歷史上所敎訓的一個鐵例，無法否認的。</p>
<p>當遠東風雲緊急的時候，美國也曾在太平洋有過一次大操，但不曾挽回了旣壞的局面，故單單大操而以恫嚇爲能事的，卽其大操在外交上亦决不能發生任何影響，今者意阿戰爭，行將爆發，雖經英法諸國，竭力調解，絕無和平解决之曙光，並且自阿國採油權讓予菲州拓殖公司後，更激起意人之憤慨，後雖美政府表示放棄，但阿政府和該公司尚有不願放棄之意，故一旦意阿戰爭，突然發動，是否能不致引起事態之擴大，尚不可知，故當　「山雨欲來風滿樓的今日，歐洲的列强，均不免有愁眉深鎖之概，一若大禍之將至者然，是外交手段之不足以打開意阿爭執之難關，已可概見。</p>
<p>上月廿五日羅馬電，意軍大操始，軍隊約五十萬人，假想敵軍，‘由德奧邊境侵入，以試騐機械化軍隊作戰實力。三十日倫敦電，英國因應付未來嚴重事變，發動外交軍事力量，地中海驅隊，調動非常忙忙碌，又據二日倫敦電，意國在北境大操，現已告畢，而英法德三國，現將繼起舉行大操，以表現其武力，法軍大規模之會操，已在昆連德意之邊界，開始進行，同時德國開始舉行凡爾賽和約成立以後，第一次公開表演之假戰演習，至英國陸軍則將至沙利斯堡平原作十三次之假戰，本來此種假戰演習，雖不能卽作爲第二次大戰之先聲，但至少亦可作爲欲求外交順利進行的一種方式。</p>
<p>據五日日內瓦電息，最後一些和平希望之國聯行政院集議，前途又呈惡兆，阿代表侃侃而談，意代表負氣離席，雖經英法外交家用盡外交種種方法，以消弭意阿的戰禍，到此亦告途窮，事態至此，恐以後再無用外交手段以解决難關之可能，惟有用實力來解决目前的困難，則戰局如何，鹿死誰手，只有將後日戰爭的結果來證明矣。</p>

<p>由城裏回來，時間在傍晚，我們是預計着在天黑前趕回山的路還沒有走一半　，雨下起來了；我們催着驢夫快跑，趕到了距山七八里的鎭上，衣履已盡濕。在一家小鋪里用了晚飯，烤了烤衣服，歇歇脚，希望着雨停了好趕回山去，但雨似乎是越發大了，好像在故意和我們爲難。</p>
<p>天黑了，風捲着雨住小鋪子的窗前打，小小的葦簾捲起來又撲下去不管，事，窗紙已經濕透了。小鋪子小得可憐，而小鎭上又沒有大些的鋪子可供我們三個宿夜，竟看看雨下，也絕不是辦法；於是我們買了把傘——僅存在一家油鹽店裏的一把——冒着雨，趕着七八里的山坡路回山去。旱得太久了，雨下的也就特別衝，山上的雨水傾倒下來，有如小小的河流，我們就在河流裏湯着水趕着山坡路。</p>
<p>天黑得可怕，雷好像就在我們脚下響，閃是在　　　上閃的，由閃電的一閃里，我們見到濃濃密密的雨挾着山風掃着山和樹，小小的紙傘，幾乎不能再支持，逆着山風，好容易才勉强地擋着一些粗的雨點，效力自然是微小得可憐了！我們全身盡濕，濕透了的皮鞋，吱吱作響；背後，脊梁骨和衣服已粘成一片：除了一顆心，全身都是凉的。</p>
<p>我很怕，我想起山狼的故事。在這個時候，一個人的力量就眞敵不過一隻野獸了。山上沒有一點標記可以證明是有人住着！（就有一盞山雨中的燈吧，那怕是奇異的鬼火，我們也安心！）我們也就無異於一隊探險者，在狂風暴雨之夜，苦求着一個宿的地方；然而沒有。是荒山，是孤島；風雨的聲勢把我們置於大洋里黑色的巨浪上，這種經騐我是有的：黑森森的波滔，一起一落，像一羣兇猛的巨獸要擇人而噬；誰知波滔底下是什麽可怕的東西！原始人對大自然的崇拜心情，我了解了。我爲自己祝福，同時加緊了步伐。一切都在意料中犧牲了，傘不幸地觸着了樹枝，破了個大洞，支骨也斷了幾根，再也撑不起來；我們就索性把牠拋掉了，讓雨淋着，手牽着手。走。</p>
<p>我們最怕的那一道大山澗，擺在我們面前了。我們的住處是要橫過這一澗才到的，平時山澗事是一條路，驢駝皆過可；通下了雨，情形便不同了。這是最危險的地方：哄！哄！哄！山水直瀉下來，挾着樹枝，雜草，亂石。水流的急度，我們在閃電的一閃中見到了‘多可怕！我們想到性命的安全，要是不幸碰着了順流下滾的大塊山石，我們就眞完了！一塊大石頭，慢些爬！」打頭陣的我下了警告。爲了要爬，手和　　失了聯絡，代替聯絡的是聲音；多緊張的聲音啊，是求生存的呼聲！</p>
<p>爬過了那大塊的山石，喘喘氣，遂置身於湍湍急流中。脚下蹈着的已不是平時熟悉的路，是出乎意外的不平坦：一個坑，一個小潭，一塊石頭；石頭有的還帶着滑溜溜的蒼苔，一定是從山澗的高陰處滾下來的。「拉緊了手，拉緊了手，」最小的雄這樣說，轟轟轟！是雷，餘音猶在山腰裏震，雄倒在亂流中了！頭上是巨雷，脚底又蹈了一個可怕的空——一個深坑，倒下了！我們把牠抱了起來，我摸了摸他的胸膛：噗，噗！噗！我們不禁失笑了。「快到了呢，過了澗就到了。」我安慰着他。</p>
<p>多謝天！我們回頭來看可怕的山澗時，我們不由得要喊！是多可怕：一條閃，一條雷，一支滾滾的亂流！</p>
<p>「哼！一把傘有鳥用！」爬上了山澗，我們笑了！不要來一塲病吧，我爲我們祝福。我問起由城裏帶回來的東西，誰都搖起空空的手，笑了！</p>
<p>上床時，猶聽山澗哄哄然！</p>
<h3 id="c192">重担下的犧牲者 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 再士</p>
<p>他，——一個赤貧的農夫——憑着幾畝租田，很艱難地維持着每年的窮苦生活，年年賜與他的環境，都是這樣。根本沒有一個時間，能使他些微寬義的，他沒有能爲改善他的生活，也可以說他沒有想到改善他的生活，更可以說他不願改善他的生活。他祇抱着這是上天賦予他的責任的心理，他實在是一個忠實地宿命論者的信徒；所以雖然他整日整年的勞苦工作，可是他一些都沒有怨恨，沒有思想，沒有羨慕富人們的美化生活。總之：中國特有的民族性，——忍耐——完全佔據了他整個的心靈，</p>
<p>妻子兒女的飯食，肥料等等的賠本，這生活的重担，壓在他的身上，常常使他威到恐慌，雖然市鎭上有的是長生庫，可是他還沒有資格踏進這長生庫的門口。於是重利借貸，是他唯一的救濟辦法，到了收成的時候，還租還債，正好支配他所有的收穫，他費了一年的勞力，妻子兒女的幫忙，所得的代價，只是兩手兒空空，於是又恢復到他借貸過日的生活了。這樣一年一年的過去，他並沒有因生活的重担，而感覺到痛苦，並且還好像很心滿意足似的。忍耐，是他的意志；天命，是他的自慰。</p>
<p>更可敬的：他不肯少微放鬆他的責任，也就是說：他不肯少微放棄他的　利。他見到他住屋的旁邊有一片空地，很可以利用它來播種小熟，於是經過他一番的勞力，實行了他的計劃，播種了好些的西瓜。在他的心理，只是希冀能得到些微的額外收入，以彌補他的虧累，今年使他特別的興奮，這空地上的西瓜，是那麽的豐收，他滿心喜歡的把西瓜裝載了兩大担，在那天的早上，挑着這足有二百斤的重担，奔到離開他家十里以外的市鎭上變賣。他的情緒是愉快的。他很想可以滿足他的希望。那時太陽威嚴的照耀着大地，他在這烈日之下奔走了許多的路，漸漸感覺得吃力了。可是他不以吃力爲痛苦，反以吃力爲喜歡。因爲他明白天愈熱，西瓜的價值愈高。不幸得很，在他將到市鎭的時候，老天忽又賜了一陣大雨，把他熱透了身心，淋得像落湯鷄似的。他雖然是很健康的農夫，也總受不了這樣的摧折，於是病源，就這樣的下種了。當他到達了市鎭的時候，他見到了和他同樣的遭遇，和同樣的昂賣他們的西瓜的同伴，是那麽的多，西瓜的價值是那麼的賤。他受了這個冷雨一樣的打擊，心中一氣急，一口鮮血立刻發現在他的眼前。這時候他過於疲乏的身軀，是再也不能支持了。於是他將就的把西瓜變賣了，拖了沉重的脚步，走回家裏。可憐他那時候的病勢，是已經那麽的沉重了。</p>
<p>現在他的兒子，承受了他父親的遺業，將無窮盡的繼續渡着他們的勞苦生活。</p>
<h3 id="c193">入學 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 二郎</p>
<p>說來好笑，我今年暑天說是到了一塊地方「避暑」去。那是一間學校，放暑假沒人住，作爲學校幹部的我那朋友强邀我去住，說道，一這麽大伏天還住亭子間，快搬到我那裏去，又風凉又淸靜』。（還有「又不用付房錢」，他沒說，我知道。）就這樣，我在他那裏「避暑。」現在是學校開學了，我也「避暑」避得够了，還是回到亭子間裏。</p>
<p>當我要離開那前幾天，他們學校在忙着學生入學登記的事，發生了一椿令人啼笑皆非的悲喜劇。</p>
<p>一羣小學生天眞爛漫地圍住着小學部主任在講着暑假當中他們的生活的時候，忽然門口閃進了一個老媽子，手牽着一個七八歲的孩子，叫聲，「先生，眼淚便從她那晦澀的眼睛裏成顆地滴着，「我這小把戲，要來上學。」先生詫異看，小朋友們亦詫異着，要來上學爲什麽要流眼淚呢？先生還沒開口，老姆子又帶哭帶說的說道，「他老子死了］—上月裏死的，—我一天做的工，才够吃飯，小把戲那裏來的錢上學。我想叫他去打鐵店拜師傳做學生子，年紀太輕了，才七歲，才七歲，：還是給他上學的好，將來認得幾個字，十歲，讀兩年，叫他到洋貸店去做學生子，認得字，有出顯的日子。給他上學，　裏又沒得綫…先生，他老子上月裏死的，家裏實在沒得錢，求求你先生做做好事。」…說了一大串，我這旁邊聽着的人，不知道她是什麽意思，小朋友們更不憧得了，但見她眼淚鼻涕只是流着，說話兼用袖子揩鼻涕。先生是憧得的了，問道，「你的意思是，要免費？不用繳錢是不是？」免費這句語她是聽不憧的，不用繳錢那就是了。說道，「求求你先生做做好事，家裏實在沒得錢。他老子…」又一大串地說下去了。先生縐了一回眉笑，好久這才說道，「學校亦實在經費不多，沒有免費的例…過，不過，你的孩子上學期成績還好，肯用功，守規則，你家裏沒有錢，那就那就…等我和校長商量去。」她以爲先生答應了，給先生一個不提防，那麽敏捷地就跪在地下磕頭，帶磕頭帶說道，「你先生做做好事，…小把戲將來有出頭的日子，全你先生的恩德」。先生馬上從椅子站「起身，彎下去要請她起來，「不敢當，不敢當，…還得和校長商量，她可只顧自己說話和磕頭，聽不見先生的話。磕了好多次頭，這才自己站起身，又帶淚與道：「我還得做生活去，小把戲今天就來上學」吩咐牽在她手裏的小把戲，」謝謝先生！」意思是也要他磕頭，可是小巴西在學校對先生只是低頭鞠躬，從來沒有磕頭過，望了媽一眼，望了先生一眼，之後，低頭深深地向先生三鞠躬。「磕頭，小六子！」媽對於三鞠躬不滿意，小把戲辯着說，「先生不給人磕頭的，喜歡鞠躬。」先生說，「鞠躬好了，」媽也就並不固執地只是說道，『先生，小把戲今天就上學了，我還得做活去，」將小把戲牽到先生跟前，作了一個深後走了。</p>
<p>那位生生回頭對我說道，『這學期請求免費的，不止她一個，學校的經濟並沒加多，現在辦敎育亦是不景氣了。」我因爲剛才受了那老媽子的行爲所感動，同情的說「像她這樣有向上心的人，兒子又是肯用功，成續好，那是應該給他免費的。」先生答道，「兒童敎育本來是應該免費的。不過公立的還得收費，，私立的，那有辦法！這學期不上學的學生很多，原因就是家裏沒錢了。唉，兒童年，上學的反而少！」先生亦感傷起來了。</p>

<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>晚飯後，芝祥哥跨出了店門，到棧房的後梢洗了一個塗過油似的的顯膩膩的身子，頓時覺得週身輕鬆，凉快起來　，彷彿喝下一杯沐水，白天裏的　　州</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>全都消褪了。於是，他搬出凳子來，坐在「沙璃」門的旁邊，若有所思地楞着眼珠子，慢條斯理地望着不遠的平靜無波的海港的碧綠的海水。</p>
<p>初次到番邦來，閃進眼簾里去的東西，樣樣覺得新奇：人是五式六樣的，像在開人種的展覽會，有的黑的像火燒過的炭頭：有的白的像四時八節做粿子用的米粉：說起話來，嘰哩咕嚕，一個字也不好聽，彷彿夜間家裏的屋樑上的小耗子在商量偷菜籃，多麼有趣味兒。就連海港里的水也比家鄉里的池塘的水來得靑碧，澄淸，天，隱約也高了一點兒，而且淸朗。此外，蕩過藍天的浮雲，一朶朵也似乎格外輕飄，靈活。「番邦的一切風光，景物，到底此家鄉里美麗多多的呵！」芝祥哥心底里這麽的響着。然而一想起到番邦來已經一個整月了，職業一點也沒有把，到提處碰着人家在裁員，搖蕩着腦袋嘆氣：「市面蕭條，能否過得年關還說不定？」因此，他只得到他的遠房的叔叔的小店里來「浪帮帶食」，白天裏就在店裏帮忙做些打雜的事情。</p>
<p>天空裏掠過來陣陣輕飄飄的晚風，把碧綠的海面吹起了一層錦繡的漣漪，元立在港邊的椰林，好像情人的喁語似的，沙颯颯地低語着。</p>
<p>「芝祥，幹嗎？老傻坐在這里……小傢伙，又在想家了！』在店里「出貨」的老杜，走過來拍着他的肩膀，嘶着喉嚨說：「不不傻吧，咱們出去逛逛，跟着我去獵獵風騷的婊子。</p>
<p>老社是個十足道地的老番，據他自已說：已經十幾年沒有回唐山去了。白天里，只要有空閒，栳葉就絕不離口的咀嚼着，把牙齒都嚼得變成黑色了。另外，他總歡喜穿着一條南洋黑綢褲子。</p>
<p>他們趿着拖鞋，篤篤的沿着海濱向美芝律走去，穿過許多不知名的大街小巷，怪匆忙的，好像有什麽緊念的事情，簡直不像在逛街子。走到小坡鐵「巴煞」（市塲）的面前，芝祥哥已經像一匹過勞的耕牛，氣呼呼的喘着，汗水濕透了他的襯衣，像在半途中淋着暴風雨。</p>
<p>「到底要上什麽地方去呢，……老杜，幹嗎老是這樣急匆匆地跑着？」他有點忍耐不住，問着，同時又好像跑得太累了，聲音沒有一點勁兒。</p>
<p>「急什麽？小傢伙，只跟着我走，包你快樂哩！」</p>
<p>於是，他們又繼續着篤篤地前進。</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸地低垂下來，殘餘的夕照給吞噬去了。站在路旁的街燈，吐着暗淡孱弱的光輝，像一個失眠的人的乏神的眼珠子。跨進一條幽幽暗狹的小巷，老杜轉過腦袋來，嘻嘻的在芝祥哥的耳朶邊輕輕地說聲：「到了！」</p>
<p>這眞出芝祥哥的意外，這暗巷里簡直像一個「巴煞」，各式各樣人種都有，特別是臉孔擦得像猢猻屁股般紅的女人裝扮得怪風騷的，三三兩兩倚在門檻旁邊，勾引着從門前走過的人，格格地擲着銀鈴似的笑聲。</p>
<p>「芝祥哥，你瞧這個婊子生得倒還不錯，尤其是臉龐上的兩盞笑靨！」</p>
<p>「咦！……」芝祥哥彷彿在追憶一件什麽事情似的蹙着眉頭，腦袋低沉下去</p>
<p>那婊子也不敢抬起頭來，心坎里好像有點難爲情的樣子。</p>
<p>「哈哈，我以爲你是個老實人，原來來不上一個月，在外面就有了「老契「（拼頭）」老杜也有點覺得奇異，打趣着</p>
<p>「那里的話，這逛子很面熟，我記起她是和我同船來的。她說要到這里來找她的丈夫，怎麽現在又當起娼來呢？</p>
<p>「這樣的市情，一個有氣力的男人還時時在愁沒碗飯吃，說不定她的丈夫已失了業流浪到別的地方去了？……不當娼，那又有什麼辦法？」</p>
<p>這人生的悲哀碰傷了他們的心，使他們心坎里蒙着一層灰黑色的雲霧，沒有與緻再逛下去了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Lin Returned to Beijing Yesterday Morning; Zhongshan Warship Docked at Naval Pier; President Wang and Others Welcomed Him at the Riverbank; Deeply Concerned About the Severe Disaster Situation Along the Way; Hoping People Will Work Together to Relief Disaster <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin, along with Lu Chao, Chen Xunyong, Mao Zhongfang, Xiao Qin, and others, arrived in Beijing at 9 a.m. on the 8th from Wuhu aboard the Zhongshan warship. Naval Commander Chen Shaokuan personally oversaw arrangements at the naval pier. The capital's police and gendarmerie dispatched officers to patrol the Jiangbian area in Xiaguan. The National Government sent a band and a guard of honor to wait at the pier. Central government officials who came to the pier to welcome him included President Wang, Zhu Peide, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhuo, Chen Qicai, Wei Huai, and others, as well as representatives from various agencies and senior staff from the three departments of the National Government Secretariat, totaling about 300 people. The warship arrived at the heart of the river in Xiaguan at 9:10 a.m. The three warships, Hai Rong, Hai Chou, and Ying Rui, anchored on the river surface, fired salutes in respect. The band and guard of honor at the naval pier also played music and presented arms. Foreign ships all flew the Chinese flag to show their welcome. At 9:30 a.m., the warship docked at the naval pier. President Wang and other government officials boarded the ship in an orderly fashion to greet the Chairman and pay their respects. The Chairman received President Wang and the welcoming party in the reception hall, shaking hands with each one to express his gratitude. At 9:40 a.m., the Chairman disembarked and went ashore. Sailors on the Zhongshan warship lined up at the gangway, playing the national anthem to pay their respects. The welcoming party followed the Chairman off the ship. After disembarking, the Chairman traveled by car directly to his private residence at Shibanqiao to rest. According to the Chairman, in a conversation with reporters from the Central News Agency aboard the ship, he witnessed severe disaster along the way back from Lushan. The suffering of the victims was indescribable, and he was deeply concerned. Regarding the government's disaster relief measures, he had already discussed them with Kong during his stay in Lushan, dividing responsibilities for immediate and long-term relief efforts, which had already begun. He also dispatched Xu Shiying to inspect the disaster situation in various places to determine uniform standards for relief. He hoped that the people would work together to relieve the disaster. Huangshan's construction has made significant progress in recent years. He had originally intended to visit Qiaole Village to inspect the recent situation of returned overseas Chinese. The village even sent representatives to Wuhu to welcome him, but unfortunately, due to his desire to return in time to participate in the Central Government's commemoration of the first uprising led by Sun Yat-sen on the 9th, time did not permit it, so he did not go. He will visit them when he has time in the future. The Sixth Plenary Session has been postponed, so he has not yet prepared any proposals. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) The west embankment and levee of Weishan Lake in Xu Bei are under pressure from the heavy Yellow River water. The water depth inside the embankment exceeds the supports, and it is seeping through in many places outside the embankment. Wutun, Yangchang, Taoyuan, and Zhengji are all located at the river mouth and are being inundated on both sides. The embankment is collapsing, and dangerous conditions are appearing everywhere. In addition to dispatching personnel to patrol the dangerous sections day and night, County Magistrate Wang Gongyu is personally patrolling day and night, urging the laborers west of the lake to raise and thicken the embankment. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Su Jian's Director Shen Baixian, along with Xu Kai and others, took a boat north along the Central Canal on the morning of the 8th to inspect the water situation, passing through various key locations of the 360-zhang project in Huaiyin, instructing on protection strategies.

<p>(Xuzhou) After inspecting the breach on the south bank of the Bulao River yesterday, Shao Hanyuan today ordered the Sixth District to rush to block the Fangting River estuary, to build a levee around the breach, and to mobilize laborers from the Eighth and Ninth Districts to assist, with personnel dispatched by the county government to direct the work, starting construction immediately. Shao, considering the large number of victims from the 15 townships that have been affected, who have no homes to return to, ordered the districts east of Xuzhou to rush to take them in to avoid displacement. However, the people are eagerly awaiting relief. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Bulao River seized the mouth of the Fangting River, and the water rushed wildly, flooding and surging. The disaster area has expanded, and the entire eastern half of Xuzhou has become a lake. The south embankment of the Bulao River has completely lost its effectiveness. People and livestock have drowned, and the loss of grain and supplies is impossible to count. Occasionally, those who float out sitting in jars or holding onto wood take the railway subgrade as a temporary resting place. Food is scarce and relief is urgently needed. In addition, the county government has nowhere to impound ships, so many residents east of Xuzhou are in the water, waiting for rescue on rooftops and treetops. The disaster is unprecedented. In addition, the Longhai Railway passing through the water area east of Xuzhou is more than a hundred miles long. The roadbed east of the Daxujia station is level with the water, and many places have collapsed. Although three trains were allocated to transport stones to reinforce the line, some sections could not be reached. Starting on the 8th, trains will travel through the dangerous sections at a reduced speed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Huaiyin) The Liutang River has surged, and the old Jingou gate in the Fifth District of Huaiyin has lost its effectiveness. The water has flowed backward towards the people's embankments and the Baojia River. The terrain in this district is the lowest, and it is about to become a disaster area. The county government has sent technician Liu Pingshi to rush to block the breach. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Huaiyin) Today, the water in Weishan Lake has risen by 3 centimeters, reaching 36.957 meters. The water in the Kiln has risen by 1 inch, reaching 225 inches. The water in Su has risen by 2 inches, reaching 188 inches. However, the mildewy water in the Inner Canal has not been completely discharged, which has attracted the attention of many doctors, who have put forward epidemic prevention opinions. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Lower Gate of the Inner Canal was closed to build a dam, blocking the waterway and diverting the Liutang River into the sea, causing the counties of Su and Pi to be in great danger. The Liutang River is both shallow and narrow, making it difficult to contain the fierce Yellow River water. Muyang has been desperately rushing to build embankments for days, and the embankments on both sides have overflowed. In addition, Pi County has been flooded by the Inner Canal and the Bulao River, and two-thirds of the county has been turned into a swamp. If the embankments in Xuzhou are not protected, then the entire Pi County will be submerged. The county is currently ordered by the Inner Canal Flood Prevention Office to build embankments, so it has no time for disaster relief. County Magistrate Qin Jieren has asked Commissioner Shao to appeal for relief on his behalf. Shao has ordered the rapid establishment of disaster relief shelters in various mountains and the use of warehouse reserves for disaster relief. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>

The water rushed out of the breach, directly pouring into the Miaotoup of Yunzhou, destroying more than 6,000 acres of farmland.

<p>(Xuzhou) The water level on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is increasing, and the Central Canal's discharge is insufficient. The railway line is extremely dangerous. The water level north of the railway is about to submerge the roadbed, and the people south of the railway are gathering to block the culverts, while the people north of the railway are planning to dig through the road to release the water. The special commissioner ordered the road protection teams organized by the Tong and Pi counties, after departing yesterday, to patrol back and forth and strictly prevent it. However, the discharge of the Central Canal cannot be delayed, otherwise the traffic on the eastern line will be interrupted. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Longhai Railway Bureau has specially dispatched the director of the Xuzhou office, Dong Yaotang, and the deputy director of the engineering department, He Gonghua, to be responsible for protecting the road and preventing flooding in the canal. According to He, the Tai-Zhao branch line has been abandoned, and efforts are now being made to ensure the safety of the main line, and to restore the Tai-Zhao line later. However, the official discharge of the Central Canal is insufficient, and it seems difficult for the water level to drop suddenly. The Daxu Station collapsed, and the roadbed is being filled. It is found that the water level in the Central Canal is level with the top of the embankment. Breaches have occurred at Mao'erwo and Guojiaokou. If the water level does not drop, it is feared that there will still be danger. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Great Britain considers the Far Eastern issue to be something that cannot be ignored, and that the deterioration of British-Japanese relations cannot be allowed to continue in a state of disorder for long. Therefore, it has dispatched Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, one of the foremost experts in its government, on a trip to the Far East, ostensibly to investigate China's economic and financial affairs, but in reality, he is tasked with resolving the East Asian disputes. Since Sir Frederick's departure, the Japanese press has been widely reporting that Sir Frederick's visit to Japan will involve discussions with the Tokyo government on dividing the Chinese market, opening the doors of the British dominions and colonies to accommodate Japanese goods, and resolving the disputes over naval issues and the crux of the problems in North China and Manchuria. Although the London government has repeatedly stated that Sir Frederick's mission is limited to investigation and recommendations and does not involve political negotiations, we observe the current state of British diplomacy and the attitude of the Conservative government, and the reports from Tokyo are not without reason. Matsudaira has returned to Japan, and Masuyama, the commercial counselor at the Japanese embassy in the UK, is also scheduled to arrive in Tokyo within a few days. Leith-Ross's trip, passing through Canada, arrived safely in Tokyo last week. This initial negotiation on adjusting British-Japanese relations is something we must pay attention to.</p>
<p>The gradual decline of British power in the Far East is the most important fact in Far Eastern relations since the European War. The rise of Japan in economic, military, and political terms has made it impossible for Britain to maintain its former dominance. After the September 18th Incident, it was followed by the dumping of Japanese goods in British territories. Although Britain resisted by raising tariffs and other methods, it has already shown many weaknesses. Geographically, militarily, and commercially, the current Britain is no match for Japan. Britain's problem is only how to preserve its existing rights and interests, so that its Far Eastern power, which has been painstakingly built over decades, will not dissipate completely. Japan's hope is to monopolize the Far East. Britain's hope is only to maintain a certain sphere of influence. Therefore, observing the current trend, if Japan makes slight concessions, Britain, for the sake of future security, will not hesitate to use the Chinese market as a bargaining chip. Today, Japan not only wants to incorporate North China into its economic sphere of influence, but is also gradually seeking to drive the British out of Hong Kong or south of Singapore. What Leith-Ross can do is, at most, only to slightly alleviate Japan's encroachment on Britain's existing rights and interests in the Far East and India, or to guide Japan's expansion in a certain direction to reduce the losses suffered by Britain. If we hope to use the power of Britain to prevent Japan's encroachment in China, it is simply wishful thinking.</p>
<p>According to reports, the basic policy of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiations with Britain includes items such as "Britain should open its world territories to Japan" and "Britain must not prevent Japan's development in Manchuria and China." This is not Japan's boast, but the true hope of the Japanese government. For several days, Japanese newspapers have been full of warnings to Britain, such as demanding that Britain hand over the Chinese customs administration and reform the Shanghai Municipal Council. The arrogance is overwhelming. However, Japan has economic and military power as its backing. Those pragmatic British are accustomed to enduring things. Within certain limits, Britain will not hesitate to sacrifice the prestige of white people in the Far East in order to preserve its substantial interests. Moreover, the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia has reached the point of explosion. Once Britain is drawn into the vortex, it will have no energy to spare for the Far East. Britain's planes and warships are limited, while Japan's desires are endless. The day the war breaks out in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean is the day Japan's military will extend into Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. If Britain does not compromise with Japan now and entice it with substantial benefits, then the area west of the Suez will inevitably be touched by Japan when Britain is occupied in Europe and Africa. Moreover, Australia, New Ceylon, and other areas have long been coveted by Japan. Britain has no power to look east and has failed to cooperate effectively with the United States. The possibility of Japan's expansion is unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Tokyo negotiations will inevitably increase in difficulty due to the tension in the African situation. The more difficult the situation in Europe, the stronger Japan's attitude will be, and the more likely Britain will yield. Leith-Ross unfortunately arrived in Tokyo when the Italian-Abyssinian War was imminent. China unfortunately has negotiations on economic cooperation in North China at the time of Leith-Ross's arrival in Japan. Looking at the current situation, British power in the Far East is difficult to avoid declining, and our country's situation is even more dangerous. Can those who hold the reins of power not be cautious and careful in their handling of affairs, so as to overcome the current difficulties?</p>

<h3 id="e28">Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs: Northeast Immigration Plan, Establishing a Company with 15 Million in Capital <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Overseas Colonial Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs dispatched Director General of the Colonial Affairs Bureau, Mr. Takayama, to inspect the current state of agricultural immigration in Manchuria. He has now completed his inspection and returned to Tokyo. A general meeting is scheduled to be held at the Minister's official residence on the 10th of this month. This meeting will establish a national policy for the long-pending Manchurian immigration project, aiming for its realization. The plan is to initiate the project in the next fiscal year, abandoning the initial grand colonial company plan and establishing only an immigration company with capital of approximately 15 million yuan. The company will provide access to financing, land, seeds, fertilizers, poultry, agricultural tools, and other necessary resources and production equipment on loan, enabling immigrants to engage in livestock farming. The government will subsidize the company's invested capital with an annual interest rate of 6% to complete the immigration policy. Currently, the 800,000 *cho* (unit of area) of land owned by the East Asia Development Company is being used as a foundation. The plan is to immigrate 2,000 families in the next fiscal year, providing each family with a loan for 20 *cho* of land for cultivation. The first phase will last for ten to fifteen years, during which every effort will be made to complete the project. If the Colonial Affairs Committee approves the company proposal, a founding committee will be established, and the support of private financial groups will be sought to promote its realization.

<h3 id="e29">Development of North China: Japanese Factions in Opposition <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi returned to Tokyo yesterday and will go to the Ministry of Finance tomorrow to begin reviewing the budget for the next fiscal year. The issue of investment and development in North China will be raised again for discussion. Finance Minister Takahashi advocates a gradual approach. On the North China development issue, there are two opposing factions in the Japanese government and financial circles. According to the *Yomiuri Shimbun*, the gradualist faction, with financial capitalists, elder statesmen, the Central Department of the Army, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as its background, advocates focusing on profitability, prioritizing agriculture over heavy industry, and reducing the financial burden. The rapid development faction, with the Kwantung Army and the South Manchuria Railway as its background, advocates prioritizing national policy over profit, prioritizing mining development and the construction of railways and ports, and prioritizing heavy industry. Civilian fascists and military industrialists support this view. If there is world peace, the gradualist faction will naturally remain dominant. However, if the Italian-Ethiopian war breaks out, the influence of fascist forces will rise, and the rapid development faction will naturally prevail. Therefore, the development of North China will depend on the changing world situation. (8th, China United Press)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Anglo-Italian Actions Forming a Mediterranean Hegemony Scenario: Italian Navy Plans Large-Scale Exercises, Britain Dispatches Fleet as Precaution <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Navy today plans to conduct large-scale exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean. This action is nothing less than a challenge to Britain's historical hegemony in the Mediterranean. It is reported that the most noteworthy aspect of this exercise is the performance of 60 submarines between Sicily and Italian Libya. This submarine force could potentially blockade all traffic in the Mediterranean, cutting off Britain's commercial and naval routes to India, the Far East, and Australia. Observers today believe that if international sanctions are ever implemented, Italy will likely impose a submarine blockade in the Eastern Mediterranean. The exercises will be held in the sea surrounding Malta, which is a crucial base for Britain's trade routes to Suez, Egypt, and India. Traditionally, Britain controls the Strait of Gibraltar. Today, according to reliable sources, Italy is prepared to engage Britain with seven heavy cruisers, twelve light cruisers, fifty-five destroyers, seventy submarines, and forty-five patrol boats. In addition, ten cruisers will soon be completed, totaling 139,000 tons. Adding this to the existing tonnage, the total will reach 455,000 tons. (7th, National Press)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Port: The British battleship "Barham" (27,500 tons) arrived here yesterday from Plymouth. It was originally scheduled to stay for a month, but has now been ordered to sail immediately to Malta. (7th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Britain's deployment of its fleet in the Mediterranean is, to some extent, due to the international situation and the need to take precautionary measures, and not purely for autumn maneuvers. This has recently been acknowledged by political figures. The majority of the Mediterranean fleet will be anchored in Alexandria and Port Said in Egypt, and Haifa in Palestine (a British mandate) until October 11. Alexandria and Port Said control the Suez Canal, while Haifa is the terminal of the Iraqi Mosul oil pipeline (this oil pipeline, 1,200 miles long and costing £10 million, was completed in January of this year). The fleet deployment schedule is as follows: (1) Alexandria will be anchored by the 30,000-ton battleships "Warspite" and "Revenge," and the Second Cruiser Squadron (including "London," "Devonshire," and "Shropshire," each with a displacement of 9,500 tons) until September 20. At that time, they will be replaced by the 6th Division of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla and the 7th Division of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla until September 30. They will then be replaced by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron (including "Arethusa," "Danae," and "Delhi," each with a displacement of 4,850 tons), another cruiser, "Sussex," and the 8th Division of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. (2) Port Said will be anchored by the 30,000-ton battleship "Resolution" and the cruiser "Arethusa" until September 20. At that time, they will be replaced by the battleship "Revenge" and the 8th Division of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. (3) Haifa will be anchored by the 8th Division of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla until September 20. At that time, they will be replaced by the Cyprus Reserve Fleet and the cruisers "Devonshire" and "Shropshire" until October 10. They will then be replaced by the cruisers "London" and "Australia" and the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. The battleship "Warspite" will also be anchored in Jaffa (in British-mandated Palestine) from September 20 to September 30. All of the above ships are scheduled to join the other units of the Mediterranean Fleet in a concentrated exercise off the coast of Navarino, Greece, from October 20 to 23, before returning to Malta. Taken together, it is clear that the British Navy can blockade the entrance to the Suez Canal until October 11 and control the sea route from Italy to East Africa in the area of 22 degrees East longitude until October 23.

<h3 id="e31">League of Nations Special Committee Begins Work, Urges Italy and Ethiopia to Moderate Tone, British and French Members Offer New Contributions, Hoping for Swift Resolution Plan <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Five today sent a telegram to the Italian and Ethiopian governments, asking them to moderate their tone during the negotiations and to avoid actions that would make the committee's work difficult. The committee has decided to create a new mediation plan based on the recommendations of the Paris conference. It is said that the Ethiopian representative has requested that the committee complete its work within a week. Laval will return to Paris this afternoon after the Committee of Five meeting, fearing that he will not be able to attend the League of Nations Assembly in person, so he will appoint Herriot and Boncour as the French representatives. (7th, National Press)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Laval, as a member of the special Committee of Five, is now advocating the establishment of a gendarmerie in Ethiopia, commanded by British and Italian officers, to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. However, this proposal has not yet been submitted for discussion. There is also a proposal to allow Italy to establish military camps and airfields in Ethiopia, following the example of Britain in Iraq. However, the British military presence in Iraq is purely to protect the route to India and does not interfere in the country's local affairs. If the Italian military were to be stationed in Ethiopia, the benefits it would receive would be comparable to those of the British in Iraq. It is not yet known when the Committee of Five's report will be drafted, but all members advocate proceeding with everything as quickly as possible to avoid delays. At the same time, the League of Nations Assembly will open tomorrow, and the Secretary-General's report will inevitably address the Ethiopian case. So far, Italy has not indicated that if the Ethiopian representatives attend the Assembly, the Italian representatives will be unwilling to attend. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the League of Nations Council held a public meeting to discuss various non-political issues. After about half an hour, it immediately discussed the matters secretly discussed in the Committee of Five on Abyssinia. Eden first described the results of the Paris tripartite conference and his contributions to Italy at that time. It is said that Eden's report to the Committee of Five was much more detailed, due to its confidentiality, than the report he gave in the public meeting. (7th, National Press)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here now feel that the League of Nations Council's second week of work will not be as difficult as its initial meeting. Although no one dares to be optimistic, the crisis has been temporarily preserved. Italy has not changed its attitude, but it does not seem to oppose the Council's procedures and seems prepared to discuss any reasonable proposals made to Italy. This will only progress after the Committee of Five submits its report. As for when the committee will provide its report, it is not yet possible to predict, but it is said that the proceedings are not allowed to be delayed. As for Ethiopia, if its independence seems guaranteed, it is likely to resist. As for Italy, Mussolini has stated his views and will not take hostile action during the discussion. The Italian representative, Aloisi, will handle any proposals that the Committee of Five may put forward with agility. However, the season for military action in East Africa is approaching, and it is expected that Mussolini will not let this opportunity pass. French Prime Minister Laval has gone to Paris and will return to Geneva on Tuesday. However, the Committee of Five will reconvene tomorrow afternoon. One of the main demands put forward by the Italian government is the security of its colonial borders. The borders of the British and French colonies, which are adjacent to the Ethiopian border, are longer than Italy's, but they do not feel the need to protect their security. However, given the atmosphere that has already been created between Italy and Ethiopia, this Italian demand must be given appropriate consideration. The League of Nations believes that the establishment of an international gendarmerie, led by neutrals such as people from the Scandinavian Peninsula, would provide the security that Italy needs. However, Italy has already rejected such proposals. (8th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Asmara, Eritrea: Mussolini's son-in-law, Count Ciano, former Italian ambassador to China, broadcast a speech here, directed specifically at the Americans. Ciano said that the Italian people are prepared to use all possible means, even to the extreme, to resist those who attempt to harm Italy and obstruct the course of history. He then elaborated that although the rulers of Ethiopia are perfidious and hostile to Italy, Italy has still been willing to make compromises in an attempt to achieve peaceful cooperation with Ethiopia, but this has ultimately been unsuccessful. The Ethiopian authorities have done everything in their power to disrupt the peace of Africa outside their borders in an attempt to prevent the economic control of abundant markets by the civilized world. To take this action in a world already affected by serious hardship is a crime. All friends of peace in Africa and the world will now know the futility of discussing sanctions and other methods aimed at curbing Italy's ambitions. Italy has now decided that it will no longer attempt to achieve peaceful cooperation with Ethiopia and will not accept any empty promises, given Ethiopia's past failure to keep its word. Today, a large army is gathered in Eritrea, with everyone of one mind. At the sound of the Prime Minister's command, everyone is willing to fight to the death. All those who bear the responsibility for this particularly important decision in world history must not forget that 43 million Italians are now motivated by a single religion, willing to safeguard Italy's future strength in Mussolini's name, regardless of the cost or the number of opponents. After Ciano's speech, he and Mussolini's two sons flew in a plane to scout the situation of the Ethiopian army. Ciano is currently Minister of Propaganda and holds the rank of Captain in the Air Force and he and Mussolini’s two sons are currently serving in Africa. (8th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece, *Il Popolo d'Italia*, recently elaborated on the minimum conditions that Italy can accept regarding the Ethiopian issue: "The current international situation must be clearly defined, that is, Ethiopia must be demilitarized and occupied by Italian forces for supervision. As for a sovereign nation being militarily occupied by another country, there is a precedent to cite, such as the presence of British troops in Egypt and China. Britain and France have the responsibility to govern independently and do not allow other countries to interfere. The mandates of various countries, which originally had a collective nature, have gradually become colonies or protectorates. If Britain and France propose a joint aid plan for the Ethiopian issue, rather than allowing Italy to do it alone, it will only lead to disputes." (7th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Ethiopian issue, political figures have once again expressed skepticism about the efforts made by representatives of various countries in Geneva, believing that unless the countries concerned obtain the minimum compromise conditions, the crux of the problem will not be resolved. Recently, direct talks between the leaders of Britain, France, and Italy have been under consideration, but to ensure their success, these minimum conditions are indispensable. The general public believes that the maximum conditions proposed by Britain and France are still far from the minimum conditions that Italy can accept. As far as Italy is concerned, if its security needs are to be guaranteed, then Ethiopia must be brought under its control to be effective. It goes without saying that Italy must respect the interests of Britain and France in Ethiopia. In addition, some left-wing elements in a certain country are currently promoting an anti-fascist movement, which Italian figures strongly disapprove of, saying that the Italian-Ethiopian dispute may become even more obscure as a result. There are also rumors here that if the debate in Geneva regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is influenced by this movement, then Italy will resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations.

The other is Ras Nasibu, who is currently traveling from Harar to a location northwest of Jijiga on the southern front.

<p>Addis Ababa: The Ethiopian troops that have already been mobilized, including tribesmen and professional soldiers, have all been supplied with firearms, ammunition, and horses and have separately departed for their designated locations to gather and await orders. All strategically important locations are now guarded by infantry and cavalry. As for people from the agricultural and commercial sectors who have military obligations, the authorities have separately notified them where to gather after the mobilization order is issued. One-tenth of the civil servants in various agencies have been drafted into the army, but officials claim that the general mobilization order will only be issued after a foreign act of aggression begins.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium continued its meeting. Chairman Lyall, the British representative, passed the annual report to be submitted to the Council for discussion. The International Convention on Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs, signed in Geneva on July 13, 1931, has been declared ratified by most countries. This year is the first year of implementing this convention. The committee has studied the difficulties encountered in its implementation, believing that the ban on illegal exports stipulated in the convention has achieved satisfactory results. The committee has also studied the fact that large quantities of opium are often diverted to other places for illegal sale before reaching their destination. It has decided to propose to the governments of various countries that, when issuing export licenses to countries that need very little opium and countries that do not re-export opium, strict supervision must be carried out to avoid covert exports. The production of heroin and morphine last year decreased compared to the years before 1933. The committee believes that this achievement can be considered satisfactory. (7th, Havas)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Takejiro Tokonami, the Minister of Communications, had been suffering from nephritis and catarrh of the trachea and bronchi since mid-July. He had been recuperating at his residence in Nishi-Okubo, Yodobashi Ward, but suddenly developed a severe case of cardiac paralysis around 6:00 AM on the 8th, becoming critically ill. He passed away at 6:40 AM, at the age of 70. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Born in the second year of the Keio era, he was a member of the samurai class of Kagoshima. In the 22nd year of the Meiji era, he graduated from the political science department of the Imperial University. He successively held positions such as Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Director of the Ehime Prefecture Tax Bureau, Councilor of Miyagi Prefecture, Secretary of Niigata and Akita Prefectures, Governor of Tokushima and Akita, Director of the Local Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Vice-Minister of Home Affairs, and President of the Railway Board. In the seventh year of the Taisho era, when the Hara Cabinet was formed, he was appointed Minister of Home Affairs. Afterwards, as a leader of the political party, he was highly regarded. He entered the cabinet several times. In July of the ninth year of the Showa era, when the Okada Cabinet was formed, he left the Seiyukai party and joined the cabinet as Minister of Communications, forming the "elder statesmen" group with Prime Minister Okada, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Commerce Minister Machida.

<p>(Tokyo) Due to the death of Minister of Communications Tokonami, Prime Minister Okada has decided to concurrently serve as Minister of Communications. The imperial appointment ceremony will be held at the Hayama Imperial Villa at 10:00 AM tomorrow. (Dentsu dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Machida, the president of the Minseito party, met with advisor Wakatsuki today, and then visited Prime Minister Okada at 3:00 PM to recommend Takukichi Kawasaki as the successor to Minister of Communications Tokonami. According to Machida, it has been decided to have the Prime Minister temporarily hold the post concurrently, but this cannot continue for long. A decision should be made within the next two days. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Vice-Minister of Communications Oohashi recently told reporters the following: "For the Ministry of Communications, at this time of formulating the budget for the next fiscal year, the Minister is especially important for the implementation of important national policy plans regarding the promotion of civil aviation, wireless telegraph and telephone services, Sino-Japanese telegraph and telephone services, submarine telegraph cables, and other national policies. Especially regarding the promotion of civil aviation, the Minister intended to personally guide the matter after recovering from his illness, and planned to meet with Finance Minister Takahashi at the end of this month to engage in political negotiations. Now that things have come to this, the Minister's passing is truly a major blow to the Ministry of Communications in implementing the aforementioned policies." (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The funeral of the late Minister of Communications Tokonami is scheduled for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th at the Aoyama Cemetery, and will be a Shinto-style farewell ceremony. Prime Minister Okada will be the chairman of the funeral committee, and Keisuke Mochizuki and Marquis Toshiitake Ookubo will serve as vice-chairmen. (Dentsu dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Communications Tokonami, who passed away, had been recuperating at his residence in Yodobashi since the beginning of July. He ultimately succumbed to old age and his severe asthma, coupled with heart fatigue. However, the Minister's death is significant because it comes just as the budget for the next fiscal year is being compiled and the political season is approaching. The Seiyukai defectors such as Agriculture Minister Yamazaki and Tetsusho Utida deeply fear that this matter will affect politics, so they outwardly feign optimism. However, if this were a party cabinet, the Minister of Communications would have already been replaced. Furthermore, the plan to establish a new party has suffered a setback due to Tokonami's death, and the Seiyukai can breathe a little easier. However, the actions of the Tokonami faction within the Seiyukai are quite noteworthy. (Dentsu dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The sudden death of Minister of Communications Tokonami has caused considerable panic within the Tokonami faction of the Seiyukai, and they are currently discussing countermeasures. Although the Tokonami faction is within the Seiyukai, they often collaborated with the three cabinet members of the Okada Cabinet, adopting an attitude of maintaining the current cabinet. Therefore, they were often subjected to retaliation as heretics within the party. Now that Mr. Tokonami has passed away, although they can still collaborate with Ministers Yamazaki and Utida, the extent of that collaboration will be very limited. Therefore, their relationship with the current cabinet will also be diminished. Currently, the only option for the members of the Asariso group is to return to the Seiyukai. On the Seiyukai side, the passing of Minister of Communications Tokonami will reduce the splinter groups within the party and promote the strengthening of party unity. However, after Mr. Tokonami's death, the Seiyukai's bases in Kyushu and other places will inevitably be subject to considerable encroachment by various factions. From this perspective, the troubles under this meaning will also increase considerably. (United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Full Text of Correspondence Between US President and Mr. Howard; Greatly Affects the Future of the New Deal <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The recent correspondence between President Roosevelt and Mr. Howard, the chairman of the Howard newspaper company, has a great impact on the future of the New Deal in the United States. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from Howard to the President</p>
<p>Your Excellency President Roosevelt,</p>
<p>As an independent editor, I pay close attention to the goals of the New Deal, and also strive to understand why the business community is hesitant and opposed to your plans, while the general electorate has no complaints. I do not believe that the interests of the business community must conflict with the interests of the general public. Although I cannot fully agree with your views on specific issues, I do agree with your interpretation of American liberalism. Therefore, I respectfully present my humble opinions in a friendly and constructive spirit as follows: The attitude of some members of the business community towards the current government is already obvious. If these members are all financial tyrants who specialize in enriching themselves at the expense of the public interest, then there is no need to pay attention to them. Unfortunately, the national business community, which sincerely supported Your Excellency in the past, has now turned to fear, and is not only opposed. Currently, there is no shortage of loyal people who deeply feel that the new taxes advocated by Your Excellency are retaliation against the business community, rather than a plan for national revenue. They deeply feel that the government is trying to avoid expanding the scope of tax collection, and feel that if the government cannot give industry a chance to catch its breath, slightly suspend experimental policies, so that the country can recover its losses and the business community can reduce its fear, then there will be no true recovery. Your Excellency has repeatedly stated your position on various national issues, so I do not hesitate to repeat myself again. Those who misunderstand the New Deal have caused a lot of damage. Your Excellency and I both know that although our national system has various errors, the achievements in the past have enabled us to achieve more progress than any other system in the world. Therefore, Your Excellency should quickly dispel the saying that confuses the public, that orderly reform is a disguised revolution.</p>
<p>Howard</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's Reply to Mr. Howard</p>
<p>Mr. Howard,</p>
<p>Your letter is very impressive. Your suggestions are based on your observations of the country's situation and are deeply appreciated. I am also well aware that Congress has passed many bills after a long period of meetings, which inevitably cause some people to feel confused.</p>
<p>Criticism is Inevitable</p>
<p>I can ignore the critics, as no one who has never governed can avoid criticism. I can also ignore others who have partisan biases or specialize in harming others for their own benefit. There are still people who want the government to be quiet and inactive. These people already had this idea when former Presidents Roosevelt and Wilson were in office. The people of the country also know what the meaning of this kind of opposition is.</p>
<p>Accepting Criticism</p>
<p>However, in addition to this, there are sincere and fair criticisms, and I am willing to work with the government to discuss them. I will naturally clarify the government's purpose, explain the government's methods, restate the government's ideals, and the unbiased news media, which cares about the public welfare and publishes impartial news, will also be helpful to the government's efforts.</p>
<p>Dispelling Concerns</p>
<p>Experience is the best teacher, and results are the best evidence. Therefore, if we briefly describe the government's past measures, we can dispel all concerns, and the entire business community will later agree with our point of view, that the interests of the business community do not conflict with the interests of the entire people, but are in harmony with each other. In general, economic decline is the accumulation of unsound organization in agriculture, commerce, and finance.</p>
<p>Legislative Relief</p>
<p>Our legislation was created to relieve this phenomenon, so it cannot be analyzed as either recovery or reform. Our actions are all based on the fundamental economic principles set three years ago. At that time, I said that the economic life of the American people should be balanced, the people's trust in the banking system should be restored, the interests of investors in the securities market should be protected, the labor community should have the freedom to organize and be free from exploitation, the country's rich resources should be protected and developed, the elderly and unemployed should have social security, poverty should be alleviated, and investors and consumers should reduce the burden of superfluous companies. I do not believe that any responsible political party dares to publicly oppose any of the above goals.</p>
<p>Tax Plan</p>
<p>As for the tax plan you mentioned, it is based on a broad and fair socioeconomic goal. This goal is not to destroy wealth, but to create a wider range of opportunities, to prevent unsound accumulation, and to place the government's heavy responsibility on those who are most capable of shouldering it. Therefore, those affected are only individuals with an annual income of more than $50,000 and estates exceeding $40,000. It is also a recognized fact that large companies have a greater tax-paying capacity than small companies. Anyone who knows a little bit about the matter will not think that this kind of tax will harm the entire business community. Moreover, after the new law was established, it has slightly reduced the corporate tax rate by 95 percent. If it is said that a small amount of excess profits tax, etc., can encourage the simplification of company organization. Congress did not allow the scope of tax collection to be expanded, because Congress recognized that it has already been expanded a lot in the past five years. During the discussion, they even used the United Kingdom as an example, arguing that American citizens, everyone (missing characters), the expansion of the tax scope in recent years has all been indirect taxes, so that the poor bear a heavier burden. For example, in 1929, various consumption taxes only accounted for 30% of government revenue, but today they account for 60%. Even after the recent tax bill is passed, it will only reduce by half a percent.</p>
<p>Caution is Best</p>
<p>At the beginning of the current government's administration, there was an expanded legislative plan, and it was known that the domestic situation required drastic action. However, Congress and I both felt that caution was best, so that the business community and the general public could understand where the reform was. Now the fundamental procedures have been largely completed, and the opportunity for a breather that you mentioned is already here.</p>
<p>Unremitting Efforts</p>
<p>The current domestic situation has greatly improved, and the future of recovery will naturally be easier to advance. Although unemployment has not been completely eliminated, it has gradually decreased, and the government's efforts to solve the unemployment problem have not been reduced. I dare not claim to have the means of a magician, nor dare I claim that the improvement of the environment is entirely due to the government's efforts, but I know that the government's various measures have indeed helped to restore people's self-confidence.</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German newspapers were furious that a judge in the New York district court only punished a communist for carrying a weapon without a passport after that person attacked a German mail ship on a previous occasion, while all other people were found not guilty. The newspapers considered it a great insult to Germany, and they hoped that the US government would take necessary steps to correct this behavior of insulting a friendly country.

<p>In your newspaper on the fifth of this month, on page eleven of the third section, there was a Central News Agency dispatch titled "Construction Status of the Nanyu Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway." The content stated that the track laying had reached Zexi, but due to the poor soil quality between Yushan and Shangrao, derailments were frequent. Therefore, the opening of the line and ticket sales between Shangrao and Guixi would be temporarily suspended. However, the track-laying work of our railway currently only extends to the vicinity of Hengfeng, and trains are running smoothly to Shangrao. The information in your newspaper does not correspond with the facts, and we are deeply concerned about misunderstandings. We are writing this special letter to request that you publish a correction.

<h3 id="e80">Hong Kong-Guangdong: Guangdong Bank Suspends Operations; Finance Department Seals Guangdong Branch; Long-Term and Recent Causes of Suspension <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Bank was founded in the first year of the Republic of China. Its head office is located in Hong Kong and registered with the British Hong Kong government as Guangdong Bank Limited. It has a capital of 11 million yuan, with a paid-up capital of 8,665,600 yuan, with shares at 40 yuan each. Branches are located in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Taishan, and San Francisco, Siam, and other places. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, the Guangdong Bank branch at No. 6 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong, suddenly announced its suspension of business and posted a notice at the entrance stating, "Due to the impact of the economic recession, this bank is temporarily suspending payments pending reorganization." On the same day (the 4th) at 10:00 am, the Guangzhou branch of Guangdong Bank on Xidi in Guangzhou was also heavily locked, with branch staff fleeing and a notice posted stating, "Following a telegram from the head office, due to the global economic recession in recent years, it is impossible to maintain operations. The board of directors has resolved to temporarily suspend business from the 4th and await reorganization. Guangdong Bank Guangzhou Branch." Before the Guangzhou branch suspended operations, there had been a run on the bank. On the 3rd, depositors withdrew hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash. After the branch suspended operations, the provincial government, upon receiving a report, dispatched accountants Zhao Zhuo, Chief of Section Liu Baochi, and Cheng Mengyang from the Finance Department, along with the responsible police sub-bureau, to count the number of ledger books in the branch. However, when they arrived, the staff had already left, and none of the account books were present. The silver vault, iron boxes, and safes were open, making it impossible to inspect them. They immediately reported back to the Finance Department Director Qu Fangpu, who, on the grounds that the bank's suspension had not been reported in advance and that no responsible person was in charge, immediately sealed the branch together with the Public Security Bureau for liquidation and issued an arrest warrant for important branch personnel to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>It is understood that the general manager of the bank's head office is Lu Pengshan, the deputy general manager is Li Zizhong, and the manager of the Guangzhou branch is Chen Shanming. They have all left the mainland. According to those familiar with the bank's situation, for more than twenty years, the bank's operations in Guangdong have made it a giant among commercial banks, with branches spread across various ports. Since the global economic downturn, remittances from overseas Chinese have plummeted, leading to a decline in business. Furthermore, since the United States implemented its silver policy, exchange rates have been volatile. At the same time, silver deposits have become rare, while withdrawals have been continuous. In total, over the past three years, depositors have withdrawn no less than 17 to 18 million yuan. This has made the bank appear strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Moreover, the bank's investments in the past have not been recovered recently, and most of the real estate mortgages have not been redeemed. Furthermore, real estate prices have fallen recently, making it even more difficult to liquidate assets. The bank has repeatedly suffered from these problems, and withdrawals have continued unabated, leading to its inability to maintain operations. A few days ago, the board of directors resolved to suspend operations pending reorganization. The bank currently has real estate worth approximately 8 million yuan, and [unclear] will increase its capital by a certain amount in an attempt to resume operations. However, the exact amount of its foreign debt is unknown, and whether it can be cleared is still uncertain. (Evening of September 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Zhang Qun Returns to Hankou from Nanjing; Meets with Liu Zhenhua En Route to Discuss Border Demarcation Issues; This Year's Floods Have Already Attracted Attention from Both Government and Public <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Provincial Governor Zhang Qun went to Lushan in the middle of last month to visit Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the disaster situation in Hubei Province and request relief. Later, he was entrusted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Qingdao to represent him in expressing condolences to the sick President Zhu and to urge him to return to Nanjing to resume his duties. After President Zhu returned from his leave, Zhang Qun rushed to Nanjing and Shanghai to negotiate disaster relief. On the 5th of this month, Zhang Qun finished his official business in Nanjing and took a plane back west. He stopped in Anqing, disembarked to visit Liu Zhenhua, and discussed the issue of border demarcation between the three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. That evening, he boarded the Longhe ship westward. When passing Jiujiang, Xiong Shihui boarded the ship to meet with him and discuss the border demarcation issue. Zhang arrived in Hankou by the same ship at 4:00 pm on the 7th. According to Zhang's statement, "During my trip to Nanjing, I appealed on behalf of the disaster victims. The central authorities expressed great sympathy and felt that the water management problem was related to the people's livelihood and national economy and must be addressed both fundamentally and symptomatically. On the 3rd of this month, the Executive Yuan passed measures to address river flooding both fundamentally and symptomatically. The fundamental aspect involves dredging, management, and returning reclaimed land to lakes to reduce river flow, using surcharges on customs duties, transportation surcharges, and land taxes as funding. The symptomatic aspect involves resuming work and closing breaches, with the National Economic Council responsible for the projects and funding to be raised by the central government and civil servant salary donations. It can be said that the measures have been determined and are awaiting implementation. Rumors that the central government will issue 90 million yuan in disaster relief bonds are unfounded. The disaster relief work in this province has also been decided to address both fundamentally and symptomatically, with emergency relief for farmers and addressing the symptoms, and work relief for fundamental solutions. The funds for emergency relief for farmers will be raised by this province and donations from various parties, while the National Economic Council will allocate 3 million yuan for work relief. This time, Hubei Province accounted for the majority of the Yangtze River levee breaches. Just taking the breach of the Zhongxian San Si Gong levee as an example, the cost of repairing it will require millions. The planned 3 million yuan may not be enough. In the past, the people of this province believed that major floods only occurred once every few decades. Unexpectedly, only four years after the major flood of the 1920s, there was an even greater flood this year. The superstitious mentality of the past has been shattered, and people are now keenly aware of the possibility of floods in the coming years and are eager to prevent them. The central authorities are also paying special attention to addressing both fundamentally and symptomatically, so this year's flood can be said to be a blessing in disguise, as it has promoted unified attention from both the government and the public. Furthermore, there are many embankments in this province. In the past, there was a distinction between official embankments and civilian embankments. For example, the Zhang Gong Embankment, which protects Hankou, is an official embankment, while the Wuhui Embankment, which protects Wuchang, is a civilian embankment. In the future, the central government is determined to address the fundamental issues, unify the national water conservancy agencies, and coordinate the work, which will naturally eliminate the dispute between officials and civilians and achieve a unified flood prevention effect. After hearing this news, the people will also be slightly reassured. The issue of border demarcation between the three provinces is also related to water conservancy. The Mahua Embankment spans the borders of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces. In the past, the annual repair costs were shared by the three provinces, with Hubei Province responsible for 56%, Anhui Province responsible for 31%, and [unclear] Province responsible for 11%. Due to regional jurisdiction issues, investigations and arguments were quite inconvenient, so negotiations on border demarcation were held to resolve this [unclear] difficulty. As for the province's depleted finances, we originally wanted to seek assistance from the central government, but the central government has exhausted its efforts in this disaster relief effort. It is also inconvenient to report local financial difficulties to the central government again. We can only try to save money and seek [unclear] expenditure. (September 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Chen Zhaoying Inspects Southwestern Fujian <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>—Also sends letter to Provincial Government to postpone collection of land tax in disaster areas—</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Provincial Party [unclear] Special Commissioner and Fujian-Zhejiang Inspector Chen Zhaoying, on August 18th, led more than ten staff members to inspect various counties in southwestern Fujian, passing through Fuqing, Putian, Huian, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, Longxi, and Longyan counties. He returned to the province on the 6th of this month. According to him, this trip involved traveling by water to Xiamen, then to Zhangzhou, and returning to the province by land, taking about two weeks. Because the transportation in various counties in southern Fujian is convenient, an average of one county was inspected per day. Moreover, the local people were very attentive to my inspection mission, so the work was very convenient wherever I went. When discovering illegal acts by civil servants, I immediately requested the relevant responsible officials to correct and punish them. Currently, the public security in various counties, townships, and districts is becoming more peaceful. In terms of official governance, as long as the county magistrate is competent, the heads of various townships, districts, and [unclear] guarantee directors will be able to follow orders and will not deceive their superiors or hide things from them. It has been found that the general public in various counties in southern Fujian are most pained by the collection of militia fees, because they are arbitrary and severely disrupt the people's lives. It is heard that the heads of various districts and townships and the directors of the joint guarantee system manipulate the fees, and the burden on the people often exceeds the prescribed amount by several times. The government receives very little, but the harm to the people is great. The Provincial Government and the Pacification Office will soon find a way to coordinate this militia fee in southern Fujian. I previously met with Finance Director Xu in Zhangzhou and discussed this matter. At the latest, it can be implemented by the end of October. During this inspection, a total of more than 180 documents were received, mostly concerning requests to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, extra collections, and those who extort bribes. There were also prisoners complaining about injustice and requesting improved prison treatment. It is said that I will continue to inspect northern and eastern Fujian in the future. In addition, Chen stated that this year, after two hurricanes and floods, the extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster are unprecedented in recent decades. In particular, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Anxi, Longxi, Shao'an, Huian, Changtai, and Lianjiang counties have suffered the most severe disasters. All the late-season land taxes in the affected counties and fees for reporting and verifying contracts should be allowed to be postponed to alleviate the people's distress and show compassion. He has sent a letter to the provincial government requesting verification and handling. After the provincial government approved the letter, it asked the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth administrative commissioners to quickly investigate and report the extent of the disaster in Lianjiang and other counties after the two hurricanes and floods, and whether there was any loss of land and property, in order to verify and handle the matter.

<h3 id="e83">The Water Level in Tongbei is Increasing; The Situation in Fengpei is Also Tense; The Southern Embankment of the Bulao River Breached <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the water from Weishan Lake in Tongbei breached the Weishan Lake West Embankment at the Lanjiaba breach and reached Wanzhai, the water that flooded west was contained by the surrounding embankment, and the water that flowed east discharged along the Jing River. The Chedaokou Embankment was located directly to the south and was initially stable. Unexpectedly, the water rose sharply again one day, first breaching the opening of the canal at Wanzhai. The water flooded the canal and irrigated Chedaokou. Chedaokou is the mouth of the canal entering Machang Lake, and the water broke through the dam opening and poured into Machang Lake. This place is eight miles away from Chengbu, and the people were very alarmed for a time. The county government ordered Wu Jianqiu, the chief of the first district, to supervise 5,000 villagers from the Huangshan, Huangmao, Duanzhuang, and Bali villages to rush to plug the breach day and night. The dam opening had been newly added with stone masonry, but the stones were washed away by the water, the dam foundation subsided, and sacks were hastily used to block it. The breach was reported to have been blocked after two days, but water still seeped through the cracks between the stones. The people of Wanzhai were surrounded by water because of the breach at the canal opening. Now, ships from Weishan Lake are directly docked outside Li Village, and there is great fear that if the water increases again, the whole village will become fish. Therefore, the strengthening of the Wanzhai canal mouth dam is continuing, with lights shining all night and work continuing non-stop. The water flow has now been reduced, and Wanzhai Village can be protected. At the same time, the river mouth at Wutun on the west surrounding embankment was breached very widely, and the water flooded west from the opening. County Magistrate Wang Gong and others rushed to supervise the defense and gathered villagers to build an eight-mile-long outer surrounding embankment to the west of the river mouth to contain the water. The water flowing east also breached the east section of the Jinpu Transverse Embankment at the south end of Jingshan Bridge. The water flowed to Wangzhuang, and Wu Jianqiu, the chief of the first district, also dispatched 1,000 villagers to rush to plug the breach, which has been plugged. Although the embankments in Tongbei are constantly in danger, they can still contain the water by adding construction at any time. However, it is especially feared that the water will continue to rise and cause problems.</p>
<p>After the disaster in Tongbei, the situation in Fengpei was slightly stable. Now, the water level upstream of Weishan Lake continues to rise. In addition, from the evening of the 2nd to the evening of the 4th, the wind was blowing from east to west, and the entire west embankment of Weishan Lake was reported to be tight. The Peidong Jizhuang was breached by water, and Huzhai, Xiewu, and other places were also under pressure. Yang Guozhen, the newly appointed magistrate of Pei County, and Yu Keyu, the section chief sent by the special office to Fengpei, and members of the Yellow River Prevention Association all set out and finished plugging the breaches without any danger. Wang Shuxian, the magistrate of Feng County, came to Xuzhou the day before yesterday and said that the water situation in Feng County was slightly more stable than in Pei County. Recently, the water breach in Yutai has been increasing unabated, and the north embankment is also showing signs of danger. Fengpei is purchasing sackcloth for use in Xuzhou. The sackcloth and cattail bags in the Xuzhou market have been completely sold out.</p>
<p>The Bulao River is the lower reaches of the Jing River. The upper reaches are called the Yan River during the day, but it is actually one river that changes its name three times. The water from Weishan Lake discharges through the Yan River and Jing River in Tongbei. The riverbed is shallow, but the water volume is huge, and most of the banks are overflowing. Therefore, the Bulao River bank embankment was built. Unexpectedly, the water was even more fierce in the lower reaches. On the 3rd, a breach occurred near Kouzhuang and Wadianzi in the sixth district of Tongdong. The water flowed south, and the breach was more than forty feet wide with a large volume of water. After flowing south, it turned east. Therefore, in addition to the disaster in the sixth district where the breach occurred, more than ten villages in the ninth district were also flooded. The ninth district office is located in Xiaotashan. As the water flooded into the district, Wang Shuren, the head of the district, rushed to move the district office to a nearby earthen enclosure to avoid the flood and facilitate command. There is the Fangting River in the ninth district, which is the source of water for Tongdong's water conservancy. The breached water flowed into the river channel, the river water overflowed, and the land between the rivers was all flooded. The water then flowed east from here, leaving Tongdong and entering Pi County. Yesterday, according to Pi County News, it has reached Bayi Ji. Bayi Ji is located south of the Longhai Railway and is an important market town in the eastern section. Pinan has also been affected by the disaster. (5th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Prostitution and Abduction Case Discovered in Hotel</p>
<p>Huang Xigui, a patrol officer from the Sijing Public Security Sub-Station, was checking hotels last night when he found three men and women with different accents in room 10 of the Central Hotel. They seemed suspicious, and after detailed questioning, he discovered that the case involved prostitution and abduction. One man, Wu Bingsheng, from Changzhou, had seduced Li A [unclear], a woman from Huizhou who worked as a servant in Panjiaqiao, Xujiahui. They had spent one night together in Xujiahui. He came to Si today intending to arrange a marriage. Another man, Wang Guizhong, from Shanghai, denied conspiring to abduct the woman, saying that he had been invited by Wu Bingsheng to Si for fun. The woman confessed that she worked as a servant in Shanghai and had returned to her hometown once. She had recently come to Shanghai and worked as a servant in Xujiahui when she was seduced by Wu, etc. The case was related to criminal matters and was taken to the station for interrogation today.</p>
<p>Jinshan: Resignation of Captain Fan</p>
<p>Jinshan is located near the coast, and bandits frequently appear. Since Fan Zhicheng, the captain of the first team of the first district of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Team, was stationed in Zhu, he has repeatedly destroyed bandit dens and captured major bandits, such as Taibao A [unclear], Zhuluo A Mei, and Gaojiao Pai A Si, all of whom were captured by Captain Fan through information and capture. The local people celebrated this. His most outstanding achievements in suppressing bandits include rescuing 31 hostages from Zhang [unclear] and 9 hostages from Ganpu. All the bandits were also captured. His achievements were also great. It is now heard that he has resolutely resigned due to organizational reasons and handed over his duties the day before yesterday. People from all walks of life regret this for the local area.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Farmers in Xiangtian Township Report Crop Failure</p>
<p>Since the summer and autumn of this year, the rice crops in the four rural areas have been thriving due to suitable rainfall. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of autumn, there have been frequent gales and showers. The rice seedlings in various townships were just bearing fruit, so they were greatly affected. The rice paddies in Xiangcheng and Jiajing and other villages outside Loumen suffered severe damage. The seedlings were destroyed by wind and rain, resulting in failure to bear fruit, and the quality is bound to be greatly reduced. Yesterday morning, more than fifty farmers from various villages came to the city with withered yellow rice straw to report crop failure to the relevant owners and the county government, requesting them to send personnel to investigate and reduce rent, taxes, and land prices.</p>
<p>The Young Owner of a Private Bank Commits Suicide in Suzhou</p>
<p>Peng Zhaosong, the 26-year-old young owner of Tongtai Private Bank in Nanda Street, Ruian, Wenzhou, was married. He went to Hangzhou to seek employment due to abuse by his stepmother. However, his fate was not good, and he did not find a job in three months. He planned to go north to visit Commander Yu of the 58th Division of the Army to find a position. However, he was penniless, so he sent a letter from Hangzhou to his father, Weizhong, asking for travel expenses. He then received a reply from his father, severely reprimanding him and ordering him to return home immediately. As a result, Peng Zhaosong was deeply stimulated. On the 5th, he came to Suzhou from Hangzhou and stayed at room 22 of the Jiaotong Hotel outside Guanmen. He secretly purchased poison. Because it was inconvenient to take poison in the hotel, he went out in the evening and hailed a rickshaw to Daoqian Street. He took the poison in the rickshaw. He was poisoned and unconscious when he was dragged to Daoqian Street. He was discovered by a police officer on duty and sent to the hospital for treatment. He was revived. He was then sent from the hospital to the Second Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, the Second Public Security Bureau telegraphed his family to come to Suzhou to take him back. At that time, the mountain police station found two suicide notes beside him, which were temporarily stored in the bureau.</p>
<p>Four Families Robbed Consecutively in the Countryside of Wujiang</p>
<p>On the night of the 7th, eight or nine robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Hu Jinfu, a villager in Liuxu Village, Gu Liu Township, Wujiang County. They were armed and robbed. They tied up Hu's wife, Shen, and forced her to reveal the location of the hidden money. Shen was tied up, beaten, and urine was poured into her mouth with a pot. The situation was extremely miserable. The robbers then went to rob the homes of Xu Laotai, Ding Jinbao, and Ding Baolin. At that time, the villagers of Tongli Township wanted to come out and resist, but they did not dare to speak out because the robbers fired shots as a demonstration. It is estimated that the robbery lasted for about two hours, and the robbers left with their loot. The four families lost about five to six hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi: The Zhenxin Labor Strike Has Reached a Deadlock</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the Zhenxin Yarn Factory in Taibaodun, outside the West Gate, has reached a deadlock despite the intervention of party and government agencies for mediation because no one is responsible on the factory side, making mediation difficult. It is now learned that 411 employees of the Ministry of Industry, including Gong Zhiping and Yu Weiqing, are cut off from their livelihoods. In addition to sending a letter to Manager Jiang Zeqing requesting the payment of their August salaries, they also sent a separate letter to the Zhenxin Board of Directors requesting relief, asking them to issue severance pay to barely survive if the resumption of work is indefinite.</p>
<p>Ding Chaowu Comes to Wuxi for Secret Investigation</p>
<p>After taking office, Ding Chaowu, the Jiangsu Regional Inspector of the National Government's Control Yuan, planned to inspect various counties in southern Jiangsu. However, due to the Yellow River floods in various counties in northern Jiangsu, he first went to various counties in northern Jiangsu to investigate the disaster situation. After completing his official duties, he returned to the province for a brief rest. A few days ago, he set off with his staff member Guo Hongzhong to inspect Wujiang and Wuxian counties, secretly investigating various cases. He then went to Changshu to inspect the county government, county prison, and business tax bureau, and inquired about various accusations in detail. He hired a car on the Wuxi-Shanghai highway from Yu the night before last and came to Wuxi for inspection incognito. His whereabouts were extremely secret, so very few outsiders knew about it. After Ding secretly completed his investigation in Wuxi, he will transfer to Yichang and other counties for inspection.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: The Court Searches the Sian Public Office</p>
<p>In the case of salt merchant Zhu Shiwu and others suing the staff of the Sian Public Office for embezzlement and breach of trust in the Jiangdu Court, only the allegation of embezzlement was involved, totaling more than 370,000 yuan. The court had sent personnel to search and found a large amount of evidence and held several court hearings. New evidence has now been discovered. On the 7th, Wang Jiaxiang, a clerk from the court, along with Wang Baoquan, a police chief, and Zhang Yueqiao, a bailiff, and Yang Dixiang, a patrol officer from the First Public Security Sub-Station, and police officers and guards, went to the Sian Public Office for a search. Under the eyes of Feng San, a worker from the public office, they searched the premises and found five books of ledgers for Huainan merchants borrowing money and allocating it to offset salt taxes, and settling interest, and sixteen various documents, drafts, approvals, and edicts for borrowing and paying tax money and requesting interest payment. They took them to the court to report.</p>
<p>Dockworkers Demand Expedited Handling: Transportation</p>
<p>The fan transportation in Shier Xu has been suspended since April of this year, and the livelihoods of Jiangxi boat workers have been at a loss. The Joint Association of Salt Affairs Groups specially appointed representatives Duan Zhizhou and Chen Zhensheng to come to Yangzhou to request the Sian Public Office and the Xiang Merchants Association to expedite the handling of fan transportation to solve their immediate needs. However, many important figures among the salt merchants were not in [unclear] and could not reply immediately. It is reported that Duan and others visited a certain Liu of the Xiang Merchants, who said that the merchants were also in a difficult situation, and that Xu and Yangzhou were both in the same predicament. The dockworkers' suffering was indeed real, and the merchants hoped that Xu could understand their difficulties. As for the request to expedite the handling of fan transportation, they agreed to discuss it after the merchants returned to Yangzhou. Duan and others asked them to convey their intentions to the merchants and requested a written reply on the results of this trip. A decision will be made after the public office meeting.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Highway Bureau Orders Charcoal Cars</p>
<p>In order to promote domestic production and save consumption, the Highway Bureau of Zhejiang Province held a charcoal car competition. The result was that the Zhongming Company was the best. It ordered ten charcoal cars from the company, which will arrive in Hangzhou in the middle of the month. After complete assembly, they will run on the Beijing-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Hangzhou-Anhui roads. At the same time, they will resume the trial use of domestic car tires and engine oil to prevent leakage.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Yesterday (6th), there was a Suzhou [unclear] News item on page twelve of your newspaper stating that County Magistrate Xu of Jiang County believed that the Wuxian Security Team had crossed the border to suppress and disrupt local order and had submitted a request to the Jiangsu Inspectorate to investigate. This is not consistent with the facts. Our government did not submit a request to the Inspectorate regarding this matter. It must be a false rumor.

He also mentioned that the Pope had received Chinese aviation graduates and personally instructed them, "You are the new youth of China. At the same time, you are learning to fly upward.

Based on this instruction from the Pope, we ourselves must fly upward and help all Chinese compatriots fly upward. This is what is meant by perfecting oneself and perfecting others. If one can be a good Catholic, one is a good citizen. Representatives should strive to act in accordance with the Pope's intentions, especially members of the Catholic Action Association, who should strive to create blessings for themselves and for humanity based on this idea.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Congratulating on Success</p>
<p>Mayor Wu delivered a speech saying, "Today, the National Diocesan Delegates Conference of the Chinese Catholic Action Association is being held. As the Mayor of Shanghai, I am here to attend the opening ceremony and express my slight congratulations. At the same time, I welcome Archbishop Tsai Ning, the representatives from various dioceses, and all members of the Catholic Action Association. Catholicism has been in China for hundreds of years, and it has undertaken many charitable, educational, and social endeavors. The Chinese people have benefited greatly from Catholicism. As for the Chinese Catholic Action Association, I have heard that it has only been established for three years, and today's conference is the first one. 'Catholic Action' means action. Therefore, we must not only have faith but also take action. We must not only have faith ourselves but also put our faith into practice. We must not only practice ourselves to seek understanding but also hope that everyone can gain understanding through practice. We may enjoy spiritual and material comfort, but others are not able to enjoy such comfort. We believe in Catholicism and find peace ourselves, but other people cannot find peace. Therefore, we must save ourselves and also save others. Therefore, we must not only do good ourselves but also help others do good. The Chinese people have received many kinds of teachings, but unfortunately, they are not in line with the times. Therefore, I believe that it is not enough to cultivate oneself alone; one must also help others. It is useless for one person to be good; it is only useful if everyone is good. Since Catholicism came to China, in addition to spreading the Gospel, it has also done a lot of charitable work for our Chinese Catholics to see. Now, Chinese Catholics have organized the Chinese Catholic Action Association and are holding a national diocesan delegates conference. Its significance is very great. The Chinese Catholic Action Association is to tell Catholics across the country that not only can individuals seek liberation, but the entire majority of people must be able to achieve liberation, and especially to be consistent in word and deed, because if words are false, then faith is also false. If words and deeds can be consistent, then faith can become true, and thus it can have an effect. Today, the Chinese Catholic Action Association is holding a national diocesan delegates conference to study and discuss how to implement various Catholic works in China in the future. I hope that the diocesan representatives, in addition to reporting on the situation of religious affairs, should also report on the social situation of each region to the conference, so that the conference can understand the real situation in order to make decisions and improve Chinese society, education, and various charitable undertakings. Finally, I hope the conference will be a success."</p>
<p>Hui Lu Delivered Address: Stating the Mission</p>
<p>Then, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai area delivered a speech. He hoped that the representatives of various dioceses across the country and members of the Catholic Action Association would strive to fulfill the mission of the association and create blessings for humanity under the leadership of Archbishop Tsai (the original speech was very long, omitted). Lu Bohong, the chairman of the Catholic Action Association and chairman of the conference, delivered a speech, briefly saying that the National Catholic Action Association is holding a conference today. This conference is of greater significance than ordinary meetings. On the day of the opening of the conference, I would like to thank God for His blessings, which enabled the conference to be successful, and thank Mayor Wu for gracing the meeting with his presence and offering his words of instruction. I have an analogy: When a country is about to go to war with an enemy country, it must summon all the generals of the country to plan the strategies of attack and defense, and then launch an attack to defeat the enemy and win the victory. Today's conference is the same. Engaging in various national education, charity, and social undertakings in the future depends on the planning of the representatives present today, and then we can achieve success in one fell swoop. Finally, I bless you all. At the end, Supervisor Yu Bin reported on the congratulatory telegrams and messages from various parties. The meeting adjourned with music at exactly twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Donating 20,000 Yuan to Relief Water Disaster</p>
<p>From 3:00 PM, the Proposal Review Committee continued to meet. A total of twenty-three proposals were discussed, all related to the organizational issues of the Catholic Action Association. The meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, a lecture meeting was held in the Zhengxiu auditorium. After Archbishop Tsai Ning led the recitation of scriptures, Chairman Lu Bohong reported that he had received congratulatory telegrams from various parties in the afternoon. He also announced that the Catholic Church had decided to donate 20,000 yuan to relief the water disaster and asked the bishops, priests, representatives, etc., present to work hard to assist in this righteous act. Then, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai area gave a lecture on "What the Holy Church Hopes from Catholic Action Members," presenting four points for discussion: (1) What is the apostolic work of the Holy Church, and what is the cooperation between Catholic Action members and the clergy in apostolic work? (2) What are the foundations and nature of this vocation of cooperation with the clergy? (3) What are the methods to fully respond to this vocation? Bishop Cheng of Hongtong District spoke on "The Evolution of the Chinese Catholic Action Association," dividing the entire speech into (1) the initial period, (2) the flourishing period, (3) the declining period, and (4) the revival period. The lecture was completed at 7:00 PM. Before the adjournment, Yu Ming reported that, following Archbishop Tsai's intention, the grand dinner at 7:30 PM was canceled and the funds were used to help the water disaster relief, which was unanimously approved by the meeting. Today is the second day of the conference, and the meeting will continue according to the predetermined order.</p>

<p>The hurricane that originated in the South Pacific on the second of this month has been moving in a northwesterly direction for days. On the seventh, it approached the port of Shanghai. The Meteorological Observatory on the Bund specially hoisted a wind ball to remind the maritime community to pay attention. According to the report from the Observatory, at 6:00 AM on the eighth, the hurricane had reached the ocean surface at 125 degrees 30 minutes east longitude and 32 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, continuing to move northwest. The center of the hurricane was still sixty nautical miles, and the wind force was strong, between eight and nine. According to the above-mentioned position, it was about two hundred and forty nautical miles northeast of the port of Shanghai. This city could avoid being hit by the hurricane. According to the current blowing direction, the coastal areas of Lu and Ji provinces will inevitably suffer from the wind disaster. When the hurricane passed outside Songkou, its left wing scattered. From the evening of the seventh to noon on the eighth, the port experienced gusts of wind and the weather was cool.</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Beiyang-class Tongzhou ship had already exported yesterday morning, but the imported ships were all delayed. The Great Britain Company's Ratchiputana, and the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan, were scheduled to arrive at the port yesterday morning but did not arrive until after 3:00 PM. However, the Hengbin Company's Imuran, the Taikoo Yangtze River ship Xiangtan, the Beiyang-class Shuntian, the Nanhua Taiyuan, the China Merchants Nanhua-class Haiyuan, the Jardine Matheson Nanhua-class Yisheng, and the Beiyang Dingsheng, etc., had not yet been reported to customs as of 5:00 PM. They are expected to arrive tonight or tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>For the matter of the Liujiang Coal Mine Company's mines being forcibly occupied by the Taiji Company, the company held its second extraordinary shareholders meeting at its Shanghai office at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than one hundred and twenty shareholders attended including Li Shuzhen, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Yiting, Zhu Yicai, Shen Shuwen, Yang Kuihou, and Zhu Yinjiang, representing 7,421 shares of capital stock. Li Shuzhen was publicly elected as interim chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that the company's mines have now been occupied by Taiji. They have sent letters before and after, intending to buy them all for 300,000 cash. The board of directors considered the matter to be of great importance and convened an extraordinary shareholders meeting to discuss everything. Then, the discussion began. As a result, two proposed solutions were agreed upon: (1) Conduct a judicial resolution, file a lawsuit in the Hebei court against Sun Xianxi, the Chinese registrant of the Taiji Company, and on the other hand, file a complaint with the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin against the Taiji Company, arguing with reason; (2) proceed with the transfer of the mine assets, but on the principle of not harming national sovereignty and the interests of shareholders. The shareholders' meeting granted the board of directors full authority to handle the above two points. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Forbes' Impressions of China's Industrial, Commercial and Economic Situation: Results of the Economic Survey Mission's Investigation in China; The United States Should Actively Cooperate and Fully Invest <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: After the return of the American Far East Economic Survey Mission, the National Foreign Trade Council hosted a banquet on July 16 to welcome Shi Zhaoji, China's ambassador to the United States, and Saito, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, who were both invited to attend. During the banquet, Forbes delivered the following speech: Mr. Chairman, Ambassador Saito, Ambassador Shi, and Gentlemen, I am honored to be invited this evening, and I am grateful for the kind words I have heard. On behalf of all members of the survey mission, I would like to express my deepest gratitude. Regarding the economic survey mission's</p>
<p>Achievements in the East: I would like to present a general report, and I hope to receive your guidance. The mission consisted of fifteen members and departed on February 22nd, arrived in Japan on April 4th, departed Japan on April 18th, and proceeded to China. Arrived in Shanghai on April 26th, traveled extensively, returned to the country on June 18th, and arrived in Honolulu on July 3rd. During the journey, the members held frequent meetings and discussions. Upon returning to the country, they also held several consultations and largely determined the materials to be adopted in the report. The members were able to work diligently, and their</p>
<p>Spirit of Harmony and Cooperation: Is especially appreciated by myself. The survey mission received extremely grand hospitality in Japan and China. Local industrial, commercial, and financial leaders prepared comprehensive arrangements and provided diligent guidance. They also had the opportunity to meet with the highest-ranking officials of China and Japan. In Japan, the members met with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and other cabinet members. In China, they met with the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, and other officials, and held important meetings with Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. I, as the head of the mission, had the honor of meeting with the Emperor of Japan and the Chairman of the National Government of China, which I deeply cherish. During the survey, the members exchanged opinions with the welcoming hosts from China and Japan,</p>
<p>Exchanged Opinions: In addition to enjoying lavish banquets. The members were able to visit factories everywhere without any concealment, setting an unprecedented example. They were able to gain a complete understanding of cost calculations, working methods, and so on. At the same time, the statistical reports prepared by the governments of both countries were also very helpful. In short, the welcome and assistance received during this trip to the East are a matter of great honor for all involved. Furthermore, during the meetings between the mission and the leaders of both countries, both sides were able to be open and honest with each other and discuss ways to promote free trade in a spirit of friendship. First, they sought to identify the difficulties and then frankly stated the opinions of both countries as a basis for drafting concrete suggestions. In both Japan and China, the speeches of the leaders, whether representing the government or industry and commerce, emphasized the close friendship between Japan and the United States or between China and the United States. Here, I must reiterate that this survey mission has absolutely no political implications and is completely unrelated to political events. Sometimes, when politics and economics are intertwined to the point of being inseparable, the mission's concern remains with its</p>
<p>Economic Aspects: Its political aspects are left to the diplomatic personnel to handle. In addition, there is one point that I have repeatedly pointed out: This mission is purely an investigative body and has no executive power. During its stay in Japan and China, visitors often assumed that the mission had come to the Far East to conduct transactions with the industrial and commercial sectors, negotiate prices, and even enter into contracts. In fact, the mission's task was merely to investigate the situation and report it to the people of our country. Whether they sympathize with it or not is not something the survey mission can guarantee. The mission's investigation in Japan was shorter than that in China. However, this does not mean that Japanese-American trade is less important than Chinese-American trade. In 1934, Japanese-American trade totaled $329,671,242, while Chinese-American trade in the same year was $112,564,381, approximately one-third of Japanese-American trade. However, we all know that China's economic development is far behind Japan's. Therefore, there are opportunities in China that cannot be found in Japan. For example, Japan no longer needs foreign capital to develop its various public works, such as railways, steamships, aviation, and other transportation</p>
<p>Such as telephones and telegraphs, etc., while China has excellent opportunities in these areas. The Chinese government currently needs more roads, ships, and other means of land, sea, and air transportation. However, due to a lack of capital, it has not been able to undertake these projects one by one. Under certain circumstances, it should be able to</p>
<p>Welcome Foreign Investment: Furthermore, China's industrial development is far behind Japan's. Therefore, there are many opportunities for the United States to cooperate with China to create the foundation for some industries. Japan, on the other hand, must continue its existing industries and does not need to create new ones. Its need for cooperation with other countries seems to be limited to the supply of fuel oil and gasoline. The mission has already held several discussions with leaders of that country on this issue. However, the main problem in Japan is the recent development of the textile industry. The country's textile industry is now in a severe situation. Previously, Japan's largest source of income from exports was silk exports to the United States. In recent years, due to various reasons, especially the impact of the economic downturn, the amount of silk needed by the United States has been decreasing daily, while at the same time, the price of silk has also fallen sharply. The value of silk currently exported from Japan to the United States has fallen by 60% compared to before, while the tonnage of silk exports has only decreased by 20%. Our government has recently increased taxes on domestic raw material production, so</p>
<p>The Value of Raw Cotton: Has greatly increased. Cotton is a major American export to Japan. Due to the increase in value, Japan's import surplus has increased sharply. The Japanese authorities consider this a very serious problem. The survey mission deeply feels that Japan will soon seek other raw materials to replace American cotton, and our largest export of raw cotton is about to lose its main market. China is currently experimenting with improving cotton varieties, and Brazil also has a large area that can be used for cotton production. Perhaps we will see that when we unwisely raise the value of our products to the point where they cannot compete with other countries, the importing country will inevitably take self-defense measures and seek the same supply elsewhere. The victim will be here rather than there. This is truly something to think deeply about. Japan is now planning to have a total of 10 million spindles by the end of this year, specializing in the weaving of cotton fabrics, which is approximately 1 million more spindles than last year. It is expected that there will be a similar increase in the coming year. The members of the mission exchanged important opinions with the Spinning Association in Osaka several times and visited various factories. The members of the mission suggested to Japan that it should not dump too many goods on the American market at too low a price. If it does, the United States will inevitably be forced to adopt protectionist policies. Although this is quite difficult to manage, we believe that Japan is also aware of this and may take concrete</p>
<p>Remedial Measures: Japanese workers' wages are only one-tenth of those of our country's workers. The cost of production is low, so its capital organization is more economical. The output of each spindle is also greater. Although the wages of its workers are not high and the working hours are long, they are all healthy and happy. During the trip, the survey mission was amazed by the rapid rise of factories along the railways, and the smoke billowing from their chimneys showed how busy they were. After the survey mission completed its investigation in Japan, it proceeded to China. The situation in China is completely different from that in Japan, and the problems are also very different. Most of the suggestions involve American investment in China. Several of China's undertakings require a solid financial foundation, and it is hoped that American capital can join in cooperation, especially since the commercial credit system has much room for development. Given China's current situation, it is unable to do so. Although the United States is China's best customer, American businessmen in China face many difficulties. In Shanghai, in particular, both American and Chinese residents are pessimistic. During its stay in China, the survey mission was advised that Shanghai does not represent all of China and that the financial decline in Shanghai is not enough to indicate that the entire country is similarly affected. In fact, Shanghai is currently experiencing the adverse effects of a real estate boom turning into a bust. Shanghai real estate prices had reached unimaginably high levels. Its rise was rapid, so its decline was also sudden. Before the U.S. government's silver purchase policy affected Chinese commerce, the real estate industry had already reacted. Two or three years ago, when the Red Bandits were rampant in neighboring provinces, Chinese people with property bought and carried their assets to Shanghai for safekeeping. After order was largely restored in the interior, many of the deposits in Shanghai banks were withdrawn to restore industry in the interior. When silver deposits in Shanghai flowed back to the interior, they were simultaneously affected by the U.S. silver policy, leading to exhaustion and difficulty in supporting it. However, there are many thriving scenes in various places in the interior. For example, the increase in railway revenue is one indication. However, Shanghai is ultimately the financial center of the country. During its stay in China, the survey mission heard repeated claims from the Chinese side about the serious impact of the U.S. silver purchase policy on Chinese finance. Now, the United States and several other countries have reduced the value of their currencies in order to promote their trade. The United States has even reduced the value of the gold dollar to 59%. The result of the United States increasing the price of silver has been to increase the value of Chinese silver coins by almost double. When the survey mission exchanged opinions with Chinese financiers, they unanimously believed that this matter</p>
<p>Had a Significant Impact: On China and greatly reduced its trade. These Chinese merchants, who blame the difficulties in Chinese commerce on the</p>
<p>Silver Purchase Policy: Naturally admit more than the survey mission can after investigation. As for the basic and important reason, it is actually that banks, real estate companies, and merchants engaged in real estate have been affected by the drop in land prices, making it difficult for them to recover. However, the silver policy came at the right time, causing Chinese commerce and trade to suffer greatly. If the price of silver had been fixed, commercial failure could have been avoided, but at this time there was no way to escape it. This is absolutely certain. The survey mission also heard from the Chinese side that what most affects Chinese trade is not the price of silver, but the volatility in the value of the currency. If the value of silver coins were fixed and unchanging, then no matter what its value, transactions would be more active. Otherwise, the exchange rate will rise and fall from time to time, and there will be no certainty of profit or loss. It is appropriate that transactions are not prosperous. The survey mission also heard that American commerce in China has recently been greatly affected by various government legislations. Recently, the American courts issued an interpretation of the law determining commercial interest rates that has affected American merchants in China. That is, the interest rate stipulated by American merchants in Shanghai should be the same as that stipulated in the District of Columbia in the United States, so that in certain circumstances, American merchants are unable to obtain cash. In addition, the extension of the American Recovery Act to American merchants in Shanghai has increased the burden, and the result is sufficient to cause American merchants to register with the British government, resulting in American personnel and a British board of directors and British managers. It is obvious that this directly harms American commerce. China is now sweeping the remnants of bandits to remote areas, still to be cleared. In addition, the influence of Soviet Russia in Mongolia and Japan in the provinces adjacent to Manchuria is sufficient to reduce the extent to which the central government manages its territory. In</p>
<p>Currency System: Although China has the silver dollar as its national currency, the national currency system has not yet been unified. The value of banknotes in Guangdong, Sichuan, Tianjin, and Shanghai is different, and their exchange rate fluctuates from time to time, and it is also inconsistent with the two yuan in Hong Kong. Chinese exporters still mix low-quality goods with high-quality goods. This suicidal trick is enough to reduce China's reputation in the world market and cause customers to seek goods from other merchants, such as the United States' purchase of tung oil, which is one example. The current government is trying to crack down on this bad habit, and the results should be considerable. The biggest problem that China needs to remedy is the smuggling of goods. However, under the current circumstances, China is unable to fully control tax revenue, which is greatly affected. The so-called treaty ports will also be merely a name, because smuggled goods are rampant and prices are naturally low. It is difficult for legitimate goods to gain a foothold. To reduce this problem, we should</p>
<p>Cooperate with Other Countries to Strictly Enforce Anti-Smuggling: In short, the United States is a good place to invest in China. The obstacles to Sino-American trade are very small. What we should always pay attention to is the opportunity for trade with China. Even if there are difficulties, they are only technical. If they can be eliminated, the future is unlimited. The two countries do not need to compete with each other in terms of natural resources, production, or even needs. The places where they complement each other are many. A country that produces silk clothes and cotton trades with a country that produces cotton clothes and silk. The extremely developed industry of the United States trades with the luxury goods made by Chinese handicrafts. The two countries have the natural resources they need and have a large population to guarantee long-term needs. The good opportunities for the future are probably better than any other market. During its stay in China, the survey mission received many useful suggestions to develop American trade. The efforts of the Chinese authorities in unification should be assisted by all friends of China and friends of world culture. As a result of the survey, the survey mission deeply feels that China has reached a level in this process of reform (or rebirth) that the United States should actively cooperate and fully invest in. China now needs full financial assistance to promote its efforts, such as railways, such as shipping, such as airplanes, such as the opening of ports, such as the excavation of mines, such as the construction of factories, etc. If measures can be taken properly, the progress of the new China into a strong and prosperous country will be so rapid that it will shock the whole world.</p>

<p>The giant Junkers airplane ordered by Eurasia Aviation Corporation from Germany flew to China and has arrived in Guangzhou. If the weather is good, it will arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 PM this afternoon and will land at Longhua Airport. Invitations have been sent to various circles to visit and express their welcome. Mr. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, will return to Shanghai this morning to preside over everything. A Shin Shin News Agency reporter explored the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Flying From Germany to China</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zha Zhenhu, secretary of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, told a Shin Shin News Agency reporter that the giant airplane was piloted by the famous German pilot Rudel and departed from Berlin on the morning of the 4th, passing through Athens, Cairo, Baghdad, and Pengke, etc., to fly to China. According to the radio station of the airplane, it will arrive in Guangzhou at about 3:00 PM on the 8th. The total distance from Berlin to Shanghai is 15,200 kilometers. This is only the second time to fly directly from Germany to China, so it is very important for Eurasia air traffic.</p>
<p>Flying to Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>After the giant airplane arrived in Guangzhou yesterday, it stayed there overnight. If the weather is good, it is scheduled to be guided to Shanghai by Mr. Farizi, the director of the aviation team of the company, who went to Guangzhou to meet it a few days ago, and is expected to arrive at 3:00 PM this afternoon and land at Longhua Airport. At that time, we hope that all sectors will go to visit, but to limit the number of people, everyone must enter the venue with a permit.

<h3 id="e101">Representatives of Oilcake Factories and Transportation Merchants Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday; Mr. Gu Xinyi Talked About the Successful Results of the Petition <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of the oilcake and grain merchants, including Gu Xinyi, returned to Shanghai by overnight train the night before, arriving at 7:15 AM yesterday. According to Mr. Gu's conversation with the reporter of Dagong News Agency, the central authorities stated that they would approve a telegram to Guangdong to stop the collection of surcharges on bran in Guangdong Province, and the Executive Yuan will convene a meeting of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to discuss the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The oilcake, miscellaneous grain, and transportation merchants dispatched Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, Jiang Hongbin, Cao Xingeng, He Quesheng, He Zisheng, Xie Boqin, and other seven representatives to form a petition group, together with Mr. Zheng Zenan, the supervisor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and traveled to Beijing on the evening of the 5th to petition various ministries and commissions of the central government. The results were satisfactory. After the representatives completed their petition in Beijing, they returned to Shanghai by the 11:00 PM express train the night before, arriving at the port at 7:15 AM yesterday and returned to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>Central Consultation</p>
<p>After arriving in Beijing on the morning of the 6th, the petition representatives went to the Legislative Yuan to petition. They were received by Director Chen, the Ministry of Finance was received by Mr. Gao Bingfang, the Director of the Tax Department, the Ministry of Industry was received by Mr. Liang Shangdong, the Director of the Commerce Department, and the Executive Yuan was received by Mr. Peng Xuepei, the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs. Each department accepted the petition request regarding the collection of bran surcharges in Guangdong Province and stopped it. The Ministry of Finance also immediately telegraphed the Guangdong side to exempt it. The Executive Yuan plans to convene a meeting of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to discuss disposal methods in the coming days.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu's Talk</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency visited Mr. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Oilcake and Miscellaneous Grain Association, at Yongda Rice Bank and asked about the process of the petition in Beijing. According to him, the central authorities believe that at the time when harsh taxes and miscellaneous donations are being abolished to alleviate the people's difficulties, there should be no further collection of this bran surcharge. Moreover, bran is a fertilizer for sugarcane farmers, which will inevitably increase the burden on farmers. Therefore, the Guangdong authorities were telegraphed to exempt it. The reporter also asked when he would leave to petition in Guangdong Province again. He said that he would convene a meeting to report the situation of the central government before making a decision.</p>
<p>Meeting This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Oil Mill Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Industry Association, and the transportation merchants of various oil mills in Shanghai, Xichang, Kunshan, Hubei, Guangdong, etc., will hold a plenary meeting at 3:00 PM today to hear the petition representatives' report on the petition in Beijing and discuss continuing to go to Guangdong Province to petition the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Financial Commissioner's Office, and other agencies to request the abolition of shop donations.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association believes that the Public Concession Police always favors the driver in car accidents. Recently, in the cases of private car No. 10099 damaging the medicine delivery car of Tongchuntang Chinese Medicine Store and car No. 1797 reversing carelessly and injuring the girl Sun Yuexiang, the handling was particularly unfair. Yesterday, they sent separate letters to the Public Works Department and the Ningbo Association in Shanghai. The original letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Damaged Medicine Car</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association wrote to the Public Works Department: To whom it may concern, we received a letter from the First District Branch of the Shanghai City No. 1 Special Zone Citizens' Union, stating, "Our member store, Tongchuntang Chinese Medicine Store, stated in a letter that our No. 3 medicine delivery car was driving on the east side of Hankou Road and Hubei Road at 5:20 pm on September 1st when a private car No. 10099, without following the driving regulations, drove too fast and tried to overtake the car in front, causing the rear wheel of the car to be damaged. The person in the car almost fell. Fortunately, our driver had good driving experience and was not in any danger. At that time, the patrol officer on duty and the driver of the car and medicine car went to the police car office to discuss the matter, but the car office handled it vaguely and refused to accept it, only instructing them to directly claim compensation from the car owner. "We believe that Shanghai is a densely populated city with heavy traffic. If the vehicles do not follow the regulations, the danger is unimaginable. Therefore, before an accident occurs, we rely on the patrol officers who manage the traffic to give good instructions. After the accident occurs, we rely on the car office to handle it seriously. This time, our medicine car was damaged by car No. 10099 violating the regulations, but the car office handled it casually, which is very inappropriate. We should ask your association to forward a letter to the Public Works Department to strictly order the police to detain and severely punish those who violate traffic regulations in the future, so that drivers dare not neglect and reduce the danger. "We have learned that Shanghai is a large commercial port with a large population and many vehicles and pedestrians. The command and management of traffic are extremely important. If an accident occurs, the responsible person should file a public lawsuit and severely punish the person who caused the accident to warn others in the future. Now the police ignore it, which is really inappropriate. According to the letter, we hereby consult your association and ask you to inform the Public Works Department to investigate and handle it according to the circumstances." Because of the previous letter, we should consult your association and ask you to inform the Public Works Department to investigate and handle it according to the circumstances." The above-mentioned situation has often occurred. Your bureau stated in a letter to our association on August 27 that "if there is sufficient evidence to file a public lawsuit, the police will pay attention to it, regardless of nationality." The rear of the medicine car was destroyed (and recently, Zhang Yuexiang was injured and lying next to the rear wheel of the car, and the physical evidence was there, but no public lawsuit was filed, and the court made a fair trial). Instead, they made their own decisions and allowed the perpetrators to not bear the responsibility. It is appropriate that the British Public Bus (No. 10,150) ran over and killed a six-year-old boy named Li Ruizhang from Guangdong on Seward Road. If you want the public to know that there is no bias, then the facts speak louder than words. Due to the previous letter, we hereby request your bureau to investigate and handle it promptly.</p>
<p>Reversing Injured Child</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association also wrote to the Public Works Department: To whom it may concern, we received a letter from the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, stating that "our association member Sun Hongfu, who lives at 816 Zhangjiazhaikou, Wenyilu, stated that at 6:00 pm on June 24th, his daughter Yuexiang, who is ten years old, was playing in the alley behind the house when a Westerner suddenly drove a car (No. 1797) into the alley. Yuexiang was run over and injured her leg. The member reported the incident to our association, which sent a letter to the General Patrol Room. After the Traffic Office, we received a reply from the office on June 29th, stating that the owner of car No. 1797 was Eddie S. Taylor, who lived at the International Hotel and whose office was at No. 150 Jiujiang Road. At that time, the news police claimed that they had obtained permission from the Chinese doorman to reverse into Zhangjiazhaikou from Wenyilu. Suddenly, they heard a cry and immediately stopped the car. They saw that the injured child was lying under the rear left wheel. Since no road police witnessed the accident, there was no clear evidence to prove the driver's negligence, so this office could not file a lawsuit. "We immediately informed the victim's family, who replied that the alley did not have a Chinese doorman. After the accident, Mr. Chen Yongkang, the manager of the Minhua Printing Factory, called the New Gate Police Station, who came to rescue. At that time, the car driven by Ai Wenyilu turned east into Zhangjiazhaikou Road and did not honk the horn. It reversed straight into the alley of Youhua Automobile Company on Zhangjiazhaikou Road, causing the corner of the wall to be damaged and affecting the little girl. There are neighbors who can testify. Attached are a photo and diagram of the damaged corner of the wall. Please provide assistance and ask the police station to file a public lawsuit. "We sent a letter to the General Patrol Room of the Public Concession in the middle of last month with a photo and diagram of the corner of the wall that was damaged, requesting investigation and handling, but the police station has not replied to our association about the handling of the case. The family claimed that although the little girl Yuexiang had been discharged from the hospital a few days ago, she still had a fever and her injured leg was more than an inch shorter, making her disabled. The police station ignored the case, which was obviously protecting the driver. Please ask us to continue to negotiate. "Based on this, the driver's negligence was obvious, and the police station ignored it, which was obviously protecting the driver. According to the previous situation, we urgently ask your association to review and approve it and promptly send a letter to the General Patrol Room for thorough investigation and handling to calm public anger and maintain humanity. "The association has learned that car accidents should be handled equally regardless of nationality, without discrimination, in order to meet the public's expectations. However, your bureau imposed legal sanctions on Chinese people who caused car accidents and filed public lawsuits in court. For car accidents caused by British China Public Motors, it often claimed that there was no evidence and allowed them to remain at large. However, because the person in charge of the company was powerful, it was reluctant to act against them, which was not in accordance with the law but was excusable in the circumstances. As for the perpetrator in this case, it also used the lack of clear evidence to shirk its responsibility to file a public lawsuit and disregarded the witnesses provided by the victim's family. We don't know what the reason is. This association believes that it is a great regret. Based on the previous letter, we hereby request your bureau to act in accordance with the law promptly so that the competent court can make a fair judgment and maintain the position of the public authority.</p>
<p>Letter to Ningbo Association</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association also sent a letter to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai: "To whom it may concern, we received a reply from the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession, stating, 'Regarding your letter of August 7th about the car accident on the corner of Ai Wenyilu and Zhangjiazhaikou Road on June 24th, when the board of directors investigated, the driver of car No. 1797 was Adam Stotler, a Swede residing at the International Hotel. At that time, Chang Mou, who was a member of the Youhua Automobile Company at the intersection of Zhangjiazhaikou Road, indicated to driver Stotler that there were no pedestrians on the road. However, after Mr. Si drove the car, he reversed about nine feet and suddenly heard a scream. He immediately stopped the car and checked. He saw Zhang Yuexiang lying on the ground near the rear wheel of the car. Mr. Si immediately informed the police station to conduct an investigation. However, after the investigation, there were no witnesses on the scene. The car employer and your letter stated that the residents nearby had been questioned and all said that they had not seen it. They only came out to help after hearing Zhang Yuexiang's scream. In this way, if we want to file a public lawsuit, the evidence is insufficient. Therefore, the police did not take any action. The last paragraph of your letter is unfounded. Those who have sufficient evidence can file a public lawsuit, and the police will pay attention to it regardless of nationality. This is a well-known fact. 'We should check and act accordingly. "This is addressed to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Zhou Xiaomei, a girl from Gaoyou, is nineteen years old, beautiful and charming. She lives on Huasheng Road. Recently, she became romantically involved with Yao Fuyu (24 years old), a fellow townsman and motor mechanic at Yihe Cotton Mill. They went to the Tangshan Inn on Tangshan Road several times to rent rooms to sleep together. Her mother, Zhou Ma, was initially unaware of this. Later, she found out and negotiated with Yao, but to no avail. On the evening of the 17th of last month, when the girl went out to watch a Taoist ritual, she was lured away by Yao and disappeared without a trace. Her mother asked people everywhere for help, but received no information. The next morning, she reported the matter to the Yulin Road police station, which sent detectives to investigate. There were no clues to be found. It wasn't until the day before yesterday that she learned of Yao's workplace. At 6:00 p.m. that afternoon, when the factory finished work, she waited nearby and indeed saw Yao come out. She then grabbed him, demanding that he hand over her daughter, Xiaomei. Yao, in desperation, used force to throw her to the ground and cried for help. Hua, policeman number 723, and detective Zhao Jianchun arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm. They arrested Yao and, after questioning him, learned that Zhou Xiaomei was hidden in the pavilion building at No. 45, Xinkang Lane, Yangzhou Road. They went there, rescued the girl, and handed her back to her mother. Yao was taken to the Yulin Road police station for detention. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution against him for crimes such as disrupting the family under Article 240, Section 13 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant already has a wife and children and should not have engaged in such unlawful acts. Under questioning, the defendant confessed that in June of this year, he met Zhou at a certain theater on Huasheng Road. They talked to each other and became acquainted. On July 17th, he met her again at the theater, and she agreed to stay at the Tangshan Inn. This happened about twice. On the 17th of last month, the girl voluntarily rented a house in Xinkang Lane to live in. At that time, she made it clear that she had a wife, and she was willing to be a concubine. On the 28th, the girl went to a fortune-telling stall to write a letter to her family. Moreover, her mother invited many people to a certain teahouse, saying that she had to pay 100 yuan to marry the girl to me as a concubine, etc. According to Zhou Xiaomei, she is eighteen years old and not yet married. She had physical relations with the defendant, first at his house and then at the Tangshan Inn. At that time, he claimed to be unmarried. It wasn't until they lived together in Xinkang Lane that he said he had a principal wife and wanted her to be a concubine, etc. Zhou Ma stated the process of her daughter's abduction and denied the matter of asking him to pay 100 yuan to marry the girl as a concubine. After reviewing the statements, Judge Wang ordered Yao Fuyu to be detained and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Woman in Labor Falls and Dies; In-Laws Falsely Accuse Her Husband's Parents of Abuse; Court Examination Proves Death Due to Illness; Yang Guoshun and Others Still Seek Other Plans <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Chen Longshan, from Jingjiang, is over sixty years old. He runs a Chen Shengtai paper goods and incense store at No. 99, 101, and 121 Kangti Road (corner of the vegetable market) in the French Concession, as a sole proprietorship. In his early years, he had the sorrow of not having a son, so he adopted one named Chen Donglin. This year, at the age of twenty-one, through a matchmaker, he married the only daughter of Yang Guoshun and Yang Pei (currently residing at No. 6, Qingyun Lane, Xinqiao Road, Nanshi, in the Chinese area), named Yang (the same age as Chen Donglin), as his daughter-in-law. Chen's family, including his son and daughter-in-law, lived together in the store. Yang has been pregnant for over a month now, past her due date. At around 5:00 p.m. on the 6th, Yang was sitting on a chair in her room upstairs when she suddenly fell to the ground and couldn't get up. At that time, her father-in-law was out at a money exchange shop to exchange silver dollars, and her mother-in-law had gone to the home of a fellow townsman in Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, to collect membership fees. Therefore, no one noticed when Yang fell. Chen Longshan was downstairs in the store and did not hear the noise upstairs, so he was completely unaware. Dai Shilong, the owner of the Dai Wanxing sesame cake and porridge shop across the street, went upstairs and, seeing through the window, notified Chen Longshan. Chen Longshan immediately called neighbors to go upstairs, helped Yang up, and recognized that she was about to give birth. He immediately called a midwife and others to prepare everything. However, she did not give birth and was shaking uncontrollably. He immediately sent someone to notify her parents, Yang Guoshun and Yang Pei, who rushed over. However, they were unable to help and instead claimed that she had been beaten. Her father-in-law wanted to send her to the hospital, but her parents stopped him. Chen Longshan reported the matter to the French Concession police station. After repeated delays, she was finally sent to the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital at 1:00 a.m. that night. After examination, Doctor Yi Le'ai determined that Chen Yang was suffering from pre-eclampsia. Because it had been too long since it occurred, there was no way to save her. At 6:00 a.m. the next morning, she was carried back home, and she died an hour later. Afterwards, the deceased's parents filed a complaint with the procuratorate of the Second Special District Court and reported to the French police that their daughter had been beaten and abused by her husband's parents, resulting in her unexplained death, requesting redress. Meanwhile, they argued incessantly at the deceased's home. The deceased's father-in-law also reported to the police that the deceased's parents were trying to extort money by using the corpse. The police ordered the corpse to be sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination. That day, they reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, to conduct a detailed examination of the corpse at the hall according to the law, and to sit in public hearing of the case. The corpse's father, Yang Guoshun, repeatedly kowtowed, claiming that he wanted to seek justice, but could not say the reason for the abuse and injuries inflicted on her by her husband's parents. Yang Pei stated that after she got the news and rushed to inquire about her daughter, she only said one sentence: "Dear mother, please seek justice for me," and then could not speak. She said that usually, her mother-in-law would often scold her for not washing clothes cleanly and often beat her. Yesterday, her daughter was sitting on a stool when her mother-in-law pushed her to the ground. When asked for evidence, Pei was speechless. Finally, the corpse's father-in-law, Chen Longshan, stated that the deceased was his daughter-in-law. After she fell yesterday, he wanted to send her to the hospital, but her parents refused to let him. After several pleadings, they were unreasonable and instead quarreled incessantly. Many people witnessed the quarrel and can testify to the fact that the death of his daughter-in-law was caused by her parents preventing her from being sent to the hospital in time. After reviewing the statements, Prosecutor Wang determined that Chen Yang died of illness. The corpse was handed over to Chen Longshan for burial. After the verdict, the corpse's uncle, Yang Guoxing (a shop assistant), along with the corpse's father, proposed to dissect the corpse to clarify the grievance. The official stated that it has already been verified that the deceased died of illness, and there is hospital diagnosis proof of this, so there is no need for dissection. The official ordered the bailiff to wave them out. Yang and others left reluctantly, intending to find another solution to negotiate. After the corpse's father-in-law completed the autopsy, he prepared clothes and a coffin overnight, placed the corpse in it, and kept it in the guild hall, preparing for the deceased's family to resolve the matter legally.</p>

<p>Wang Tugen, the eldest son of Wang Miaogen, a farmer residing in Wangjia Dongzhai, Zhujiaxiang Town, West Shanghai, is currently fourteen years old. Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 p.m., he was carrying a grass basket and returning home after cutting grass. While walking near the No. 5 Bridge on the Shanghai-Minhang South Zhe Road, an automobile suddenly came speeding from the west to the east from behind. Tugen was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, injuring his arm. The car, seeing that it had caused an accident, immediately sped away, so the car number is also unknown. Later, a fellow villager caught a glimpse of it and notified his father, Wang Miaogen, who then found a way to transport him to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>After Li Pengxian, a prominent pawnshop merchant from Ningbo, died of illness on the 5th day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year, his second son, Yusheng, also passed away on the 27th of the same month. Li Pengxian's estate was entirely managed by his eldest son, Yu Sheng, owner of Yuchang Metal Company. Yu Sheng had a wife, Sun, who gave birth to a daughter, and a concubine, Shi, who gave birth to a son, Cheng Hao, who is not yet an adult. Recently, Yu Sheng sold a portion of the estate, a piece of land on North Meiyuan Road, for a price of 2,800 yuan. When signing the contract, Yu Sheng insisted that Cheng Hao sign it. Afterwards, Cheng Hao's mother, Li Shi Zhongde, claimed that her son's signature at the time was obtained under duress and questioned the sale of the land. She then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against Li Yu Sheng in the First Special District Court to confirm the invalidity of the sales contract. There have been several summons and attempts at mediation, but no agreement has been reached to date. Therefore, yesterday, Judge Shen Hong of the First Special District Court continued the hearing in the Sixth Civil Division. Zhou, Li Pengxian's wife, and Sun, Li Yusheng's wife, were summoned to court for questioning. Then, Li Shi stated that she had never been consulted before the sale of the land and that the signature was signed during the period of her late husband's seventh-day memorial, and they took advantage of this opportunity to force her son to sign. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer and the defendant's lawyer, Wang Chuanbi, argued with each other. Judge Shen then adjourned the hearing for further verification. It is heard that Li Jiaorong, Li Pengxian's married daughter, has also hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Li Yu Sheng and Cheng Hao to demand the partition of her father's estate of 150,000 yuan, requesting to split it into three parts, totaling 50,000 yuan. This case will also be heard by the court in the near future.</p>

<p>Detectives Mao Jinsheng, Wang Zhihao, and Bao Zhang Fengming of the French Concession Police Station successively arrested drug traffickers Wu Fashou (35 years old, from Taizhou), Wang Gu (38 years old, from Haimen), Wu Acai (33 years old, from Changshu), and Chang Fukang (nicknamed "Turtle Little Boss," 28 years old, from Yangzhou), as well as suspects Hua Changsheng (32 years old, from Zhenjiang) and Yao Jisheng (29 years old, from Ningbo), at No. 12, Bai'er Road, No. 124, Caishi Road, No. 275, Mintini Yin Road, the overpass in Jinyu Lane, No. 3, Jinyu Lane, and No. 435-5, Ailaige Road on the 16th of last month. A thousand red pills and sixteen small packages of morphine were seized from the homes of Wu Fashou and Chang Fukang. Under questioning, Wu and others confessed that they bought the red pills from "Hankou Asi," the big boss at No. 32, Fuchang Lane, Sixth Road, and the morphine came from a phone call to No. 94248, and someone would deliver the goods. The detectives went to arrest Hankou Asi, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Wu and others were then sent to the Second Special District Court, where the police lawyer filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of selling opium substitutes in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Anti-Smoking Law. The investigation is detailed in this newspaper. The case has been concluded by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, who sentenced Wu Fashou and Wang Gu to two months of imprisonment each, Wu Acai to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Chang Fukang to four months of imprisonment.

<p>Ge Ruilong, an employee of a song and dance troupe, lives at No. 4, Qinglong Bridge, Nanshi. In October of last year, he lured Gu Zhen, a young girl from Yangzhou living at No. 38, Xinjie, Nanshi, to a hotel for illicit affairs. They spent time together intimately. In early August of this year, her mother, Gu Xu, found out and immediately reported the matter to the procuratorate of the local court. Prosecutor Du Jiasheng summoned them for questioning. As a result, Ge Ruilong was prosecuted for luring a woman under the age of twenty away from her family, violating Article 240, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the Fifth Court for the trial. The defendant, Ge Ruilong, hired lawyer Chen Kuitang to appear in court for his defense. According to Ge Ruilong's statement, he is twenty years old, a local, and Gu Zhen was promised to him by her mother as his wife. She often came to his house to play. Now he is unemployed, so he cannot formally hold the wedding for the time being. According to Gu Zhen's statement, she is eighteen years old and her mother has promised her to Ge Ruilong as his wife, and she has received a betrothal gift of 20 yuan. However, the marriage certificate has not been made, and the matchmaker is Mr. Wang. Finally, Gu Xu stated that although the marriage was discussed earlier, the birthdates have never been exchanged. After hearing the statements, the judge ordered the start of the debate. The defendant's lawyer rose to defend the case. The hearing was adjourned at noon and scheduled for sentencing on the 12th.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Liang Tongfang Represents Villagers in an Appeal to the Zhejiang Provincial Government Regarding the Expansion of the Yuan Lake Sluice Gate Damaging Farmland; Requests Order to Rebuild According to the Old Design to Protect Water Conservancy <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shiye Society, Liang Tongfang, a patriotic person, was recently requested by 150 fellow villagers, including Liang Jiajin, Liang Guiren, Ni Fucheng, Fu Tuchao, and Wang Abao, to represent all the villagers in an appeal to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the damage to farmland caused by the kiln owner Wang Guoquan expanding the Yuan Lake sluice gate. A reporter from the Shiye Society recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Representative Appeal</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang is originally from Shunmu Township, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province. When he returned to his hometown last month to visit his relatives, more than 150 villagers, including Liang Jiajin, Liang Jiafa, Liang Guiren, Liang Jiazhen, Liang Wufu, Liang Caifu, Fu Shichao, Fu Mengyu, Fu Afang, Fu Fanglian, Wang Abao, Yu Renzhao, Lu Yuting, Zhu Hualin, and Zhu Meijin, stated that the local kiln owner Wang Guoquan was acting in his own interests, damaging the farmland, and had secretly requested the Construction Department to expand the Yuan Lake sluice gate, which is extremely important for farmland water conservancy, to more than double its original size. They were indignant and convened a large farmers' meeting, publicly requesting Liang to act as their full representative and appeal to the provincial government to rebuild the gate to its original width in order to store water and irrigate farmland. It is learned that Liang has already submitted a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting permission to order the Shangyu County Government to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Petition to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Petition for the expansion of the sluice gate damaging farmland, a sincere plea for information, respectfully requesting consideration and ordering the Shangyu County Government to allow the restoration to its original state. The petitioners reside in Jiapang Village, Shunmu Township, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province. There is a Yuan Lake in the area, with an area of approximately eighty mu and a circumference of approximately one li. The land under its protection is approximately eight hundred mu. Since ancient times, a stone sluice gate has been placed on the lake embankment, known as the "Lake Gate," to discharge water into the Tongjing River, which flows directly to the large river. Later, because the gate was in disrepair for many years, the owners and tenants of the protected farmland jointly submitted a request to the county government to construct the lake gate in 1936. Unexpectedly, Wang Guoquan, a nearby kiln owner, clinging to his own interests and disregarding the public good, believed that the gate was too small to allow mud boats to pass through. He dared to come out and resist and obstruct the construction. Fortunately, the former County Magistrate Zhang Jingxu ordered the district bureau chief to stipulate the width of the gate to be four chi and sent police to supervise the construction, which was finally completed. However, Wang Guoquan was dissatisfied and acted arbitrarily, taking advantage of his power to secretly expand the lake gate to more than double its original size that winter in order to facilitate his own purposes. Mud boats can now freely enter and exit, but since then, the lake water cannot be stored, and it quickly dries up in times of drought. The income of the eight hundred mu of farmland under its protection is completely hopeless. The lake is higher than the farmland, and there is no source of water flowing into it. It relies entirely on rainwater to fill it. Moreover, it is not far from the large river, and the water flows downstream unimpeded. Therefore, since ancient times, the lake gate has been built with a width of only a few chi. During the spring plowing, it is necessary to discharge water from time to time and divert it into the Tong River to irrigate the farmland outside the lake. However, it is only opened and closed by officials to provide irrigation. The intention is to prevent the water from overflowing and ensure that every drop goes to the farmland. If the gate is as wide as it is now, the rapid current will quickly recede and drain easily. Recalling the drought last year, the lake dried up before other lakes, and the crops yielded nothing, which serves as a warning. Now, the villagers have entrusted us to continue to appeal. It is in the private interest of the mud boat to have access, while it is in the public interest of the irrigation of the farmland. How can one favor private interests over the public good? And how can one lightly overturn and sacrifice the centuries-old established rules to the misguided notion of satisfying one's own desires? Is this not a strange thing? We believe that our wise government will not allow this to happen. The villagers represented by the petitioners are purely for the public good and have no selfish motives. We have always admired your government's unwavering efforts to revive agriculture and its eagerness to save the people from water and fire. We humbly request that you quickly order the transfer of the instructions issued by former County Magistrate Zhang Jingxu in May 1931, as well as the files related to the supervision of the construction of the Yuan Lake Gate and the petition submitted to County Magistrate Chen for reconstruction in July of this year, for your review and approval. Please also order the Shangyu County Government to allow the restoration to its original state to protect water conservancy and maintain agriculture. We eagerly await your response. Presented to the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang, by the village representative Liang Tongfang of Shunm Township, Shangyu County.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Recent News from the Silver Industry Resumption Preparatory Office <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo Industrial Bank temporarily ceased receiving deposits and withdrawals, for the sake of restoring the commercial reputation of Ningbo people in Shanghai, and to protect the interests of all creditors, the Ningbo natives in Shanghai, along with the bank's directors, supervisors, and creditors, jointly initiated a resumption movement to plan for the bank's resumption. Subsequently, with the consent of all creditors, the signing and subscription for resumption and increased capital reached three-quarters of the total amount of the bank's debts. The handling has shown initial progress, and through repeated newspaper announcements and the election of preparatory members to establish a preparatory office, all work is being conducted openly. It is hoped that members of society will witness this together. On August 3rd, the association received a letter from Commissioner Luo, appointed by the Ministry [of Finance], inquiring about the resumption plan and instructing that the progress of the resumption be reported at any time. The Resumption Movement Association complied with the instructions and, on August 7th, August 16th, and August 24th, submitted to Commissioner Luo the plan for resuming and clearing debts, the names of the initiators, and the amount of resumption capital signed and subscribed by each creditor, respectively, for submission to the Ministry of Finance for approval and record. There were receipts for income and expenditure as proof. Although it is uncertain whether Commissioner Luo has forwarded our submitted documents to the Ministry of Finance, as official approval has not yet been received, we dare not make any predictions. However, Commissioner Luo is already fully aware of all aspects of our handling of the resumption, as evidenced by written records. Yesterday, we saw in the Shanghai newspaper that Commissioner Luo's reply to lawyer Qiu stated that he was not clear about our resumption situation. We cannot fathom the intention behind this. In addition to requesting Commissioner Luo to explain in person, we are deeply concerned about misunderstandings in all sectors. Therefore, we hereby declare the facts of the submission to the Ministry. However, our handling of the resumption is actively progressing. We are doing our utmost to seek benefits for creditors and will not terminate our work due to external misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Lying diagonally in a rented car, laughing at the people walking slowly on the sidewalk, who knew a horse-drawn carriage would pass by your car, and the people in the carriage were also laughing at you for being slow. Friend, don't laugh! The people in trams and automobiles are also laughing at our speed, as none of us are as fast as them! This kind of laughing at each other perfectly matches a common saying: "Sufficient compared to those below, but insufficient compared to those above." The same is true of people's wealth!</p>
<p>You secretly add fuel to the fire in front of your superiors, energetically speaking ill of your colleagues. Like a hairy soybean, you pick the plump pods to attack and crush others. Perhaps after you leave, someone else may be wagging their tongue and kicking their feet in front of your superiors, talking about your "shortcomings," attacking and crushing you!</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Franco-Prussian War and the Rotating Pillar in Front of Barber Shops <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Zhangqing</p>
<p>In this publication, Mr. Wu Aibo provided an explanation for the rotating pillar in front of barber shops. He based his account on a traveler's observations, believing it originated in Europe. In ancient Europe, barbers also practiced as surgeons, hence its use as a symbol. This seems quite reasonable, as many barbers in our country also practice as surgeons. However, according to my knowledge, there is another explanation: It is said that during the Franco-Prussian War, a French barber was brave and skilled in battle, single-handedly killing over a hundred enemies, but eventually died. The French authorities praised his loyalty and valor in sacrificing himself for the country, and specially wrapped his body in the red, white, and blue national flag and transported it back to his hometown as a way to honor him. Therefore, barbers adopted this as a matter of pride, and to commemorate the event, they erected such a thing in front of each barber shop, which has been passed down to this day, and is also practiced abroad.</p>
<p>Based on this account, I am writing this down based on memory. Let this be just one explanation. If this symbol already existed before the Franco-Prussian War, or if there are other reasons, I am not insightful and will not investigate further.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Streetlights <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>On busy streets, hundreds of bright streetlights stand and connect, illuminating the area as if it were daytime, benefiting vehicles, horses, and pedestrians. Even on quiet roads, a streetlight with a dozen or so lights shines every ten yards or so, allowing pedestrians to see their feet clearly and avoid bumping into things. Who says streetlights are just decorations? In the dark night, they are as effective as a compass in the vast sea.</p>
<p>All things progress with the passage of time, and even these small streetlights have undergone many changes. When I was young, busy streets only had flickering sky lanterns, which were wooden poles with a square glass frame on top, inside which was an oil lamp. Small streets didn't even have this kind of lamp. On clear moonlit nights, walking on the road wasn't too bad; but on dark and windy nights, if you didn't have a candle in your hand, you couldn't see your fingers in front of you, and no matter how capable you were, you couldn't walk on the unfamiliar road. Sometimes dogs would lie in the street, and you would step on one and get bitten. Sometimes pedestrians would come face to face, and everyone would bump into each other fiercely before they could avoid each other. People who have never experienced this would certainly think I'm exaggerating, but if you ask older people, they will certainly say it's true! Later, in Shanghai, oil streetlights were abolished and replaced with gas streetlights, with a glass cover and a gauze shade inside, emitting a green flame. Although they were bright, they were also somewhat eerie. But the interior didn't even have this kind of lamp! It wasn't until electric lights were invented and transmitted to China that streetlights were also upgraded with the latest equipment, and the streets were brightly lit.</p>
<p>What will streetlights be like in the future? According to scientists' predictions—as seen in the book "The World Fifty Years Hence"—the current arrangement of streetlights scattered here and there is too troublesome. It will only be necessary to install a very large streetlight in the air at a suitable location, connect it to a powerful electricity source, and with a turn of the switch, it will be as bright as the sun. At that time, perhaps even household lights will no longer be needed. However, when this kind of streetlight will be invented, please young people wait patiently! You will surely be able to see it.</p>

<p>Chapter 18: Qi Dang Gaozhong Flatteringly Rebukes the Clerk, Madam Acts Fiercely and Noisily Annoying.</p>
<p>He heard that Commissioner Lan upstairs was calling the tea boy downstairs, which meant that his colleagues upstairs had not handled things well. That was why he had to send another raw hand up there. Maybe if he took out twenty or thirty dollars to buy things, he could take advantage of Jia. So he answered with an "Oh" and ran upstairs. When he got to the Commissioner's door, he paused for a moment to catch his breath, and then went in unhurriedly. He saw Commissioner Jian leaning back in his chair with a pipe in his mouth, looking quite relaxed. There was a wine bottle on the table, and several empty cans. The air was thick with the smell of alcohol, probably after he had had his evening drink. His wife stood firmly with one hand on the table, glared at him and asked, "Are you the tea boy downstairs?" Ma San said, "Yes, Madam, what are your orders?" Mrs. Lan said, "What kind of woman lives downstairs? It's so late, and she's still crying?" Ma San didn't expect to be called up to answer such a question, and was a little unhappy. He replied, "She is the family member of a guest, I don't know why she's crying." Mrs. Lan said, "Are you tea boys only good for eating? It's so late, and the guest is still crying. Of course there's a reason, why don't you ask?" Ma San said with a faint smile, "How can I, as a tea boy, go and ask a female guest why she is crying?" Mrs. Lan slapped the table and said, "This guy is outrageous. I say one thing, and he contradicts me with another." Ma San thought to himself, "I'm a tea boy downstairs, I don't serve you." So he replied, "I'm a tea boy downstairs, I don't care about the guests upstairs." As he said this, he turned around and walked out. Mrs. Lan slapped the table repeatedly and said, "Come back! Come back! Who are you talking to? If you say another word, I'll break your legs!" (310)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This is really time-consuming, and it requires patience; also, usually, when she wants to wash her hands, we must be there to serve her, and after washing, we must use a towel to pat them dry in the same way. Even the floral lotion she applies to her face every night is also applied to her hands. This task is performed by the lady-in-waiting who is on duty that night.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are countless ways that the Empress Dowager wants to beautify herself!</p>
<p>One of them is to take ground pearl powder once every ten days. I have never carefully calculated how many pearls she needs for each serving of pearl powder. I only know that the pearls used for grinding the powder are all small pearls, generally round and lustrous, and very valuable. Each time the powder is ground, it is about a small teaspoon. The teaspoon is made of silver, and the style is different from ordinary ones. It is probably specially made for the Empress Dowager to take pearl powder. This practice of taking pearl powder has been going on for decades and has never been interrupted. It has almost become a fixed system; every ten days, almost at the same time, the eunuch in charge of grinding the pearl powder uses a piece of yellow silk to hold the silver spoon and presents the ground pearl powder to the Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager doesn't need to ask any more questions. As soon as she sees this person coming in, she knows it's time to take the pearl powder. (410)</p>

<p>— Haike</p>
<p>There is a small island, a country in its own right under the flag of the British Empire, which is probably the strangest country in the world. Ruling this country is a lady, and although her country is small, it even has a parliament, but it only meets three times a year. The lady herself is the chairman, and she enjoys various privileges inherited from ancient times.</p>
<p>This island country is called Sark and is located in the English Channel. This queen does not have the title of "Queen," but is only called "Dame of Sark." Sark Island's neighbor, a small island called Brecqhou, is being put up for sale. If someone buys this island, they can obtain the qualification of a member of parliament, because not only can they be the owner of this island, but they can also occupy a seat in the ancient parliament of Sark. Brecqhou Island is only three-quarters of a mile long and half a mile wide, with a total of three islanders, two houses, one field, a curved road one mile long, a pier for steamboats, and various fishing interests. Whoever buys this island must pay one pound sterling to "Dame of Sark" for every thirteen pounds of the purchase price, because Brecqhou is under the jurisdiction of Sark Island, and this money is a special tax.</p>
<p>"Dame of Sark" is the only female leader in the British Empire and enjoys full administrative power. In addition to serving as the chairman of the parliament, she can also raise pigeons, open mills, or keep a female dog, which are her exclusive rights and cannot be enjoyed by anyone else on the island. All land on the island that is sold must have her consent, and a special tax of one pound sterling is levied on every thirteen pounds of the purchase price.</p>
<p>Sark Island has a total of forty fields. The owners of the fields must pay various taxes of different qualities. The strangest thing is that there is a tax that requires each household to pay poultry to "Dame of Sark" according to the number of windows in the house. Every window is required to pay one poultry, and so on. In order to save money, the islanders have to open fewer windows on their houses.</p>
<p>The current "Dame of Sark" is Mrs. D. Beaumont, the widow of a British cavalry officer. Her great-grandfather, T. G. Collings, bought the island in 1852. After his death, the property was inherited by his daughter-in-law, and then passed on to Mrs. Beaumont. Because she likes to travel and has traveled all over the world, she has seen a lot and has a broad perspective. Ruling this small island of Sark is not a big deal. Mrs. Beaumont has six children, and it is unknown which one will inherit her and become the owner of Sark Island.</p>
<p>Sark Island is very small, but its responsibilities are not light. Relying on her talents, she has taken on the task. For example, hygiene planning, school examinations, road repairs, harbor construction, fishery legislation, and tax formulation are all the responsibilities of the island government and are all handled by her personally. Everything is well organized. The island's parliament meets only three times a year, and she chairs all meetings to discuss all matters of reform and innovation on the island. The parliament also serves as the supreme court, and if there are any disputes among the people, they must ultimately be appealed to the parliament.</p>
<p>Sark Island has the right to participate in any ceremonies held in the British Empire. Mrs. Beaumont attends as "Dame of Sark" and represents the island. She is the only busy person on the island, handling both internal and external affairs.</p>
<p>Sark Island pays tribute to King George of England, and the title is very special, because it adheres to the ancient system, so it still uses the old title of Duke of Normandy. All documents presented to the King of England are in French, calling him "My King, My Duke," "Re Roi, Nofre Duc." This is also a very special matter. The people of Sark Island never speak English; they speak the purest Norman French, which is said to still preserve the language of William the Conqueror and his followers.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Mayor Wu Personally Cuts Ribbon at Grand Opening of City Swimming Pool Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Chen Baoxuan Performs Water Entry Ceremony; Male and Female Athletes Hold Exhibition Matches; Officially Open to the Public Starting Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Swimming Pool held its opening ceremony yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Mayor Wu personally cut the ribbon and delivered the opening speech. Ms. Chen Baoxuan performed the water entry ceremony, and athletes from the city preparing to participate in the National Games participated in exhibition matches. More than two thousand people from all walks of life traveled from afar to visit and unanimously praised the construction of the swimming pool. The pool is officially open to the public starting today, with tickets still priced at twenty cents. A detailed account of yesterday's events follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Madam Jiang (Chen Bijun), Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Secretaries Tang Shixuan and Chang Tingrong, Section Chief Li Dachao, Director of Education Pan Gongzhan, Director of Public Utilities Xu Peihuang, Director of Health Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Jian Shiqin, as well as Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaopei, Yan Fuqing, Rong Zongjing, Hu Xiyuan, Lu Bohong, Dong Dayou, Shen Siliang, Jiang Jianbai, and over two thousand spectators from all walks of life. Li Dachao of the Municipal Government served as the chief host, with Lin Yannan, Wang Keyong, Lü Hailan, and Zhang Yinhuai serving as hosts.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Scene</p>
<p>Before 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, vehicles on Jiangwan Road were bumper to bumper, and pedestrians were shoulder to shoulder, all heading to the city center to attend the ceremony. The China General Omnibus Company specially operated one-way buses directly to the pool, which were packed with passengers, leaving no room. Spectators along the way simply could not board. In front of the swimming pool, there was a constant flow of traffic and a sea of people, truly an unprecedented sight.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Décor</p>
<p>The opening ceremony platform was set up on the third floor of the swimming pool, with guests below and spectators in the left and right stands. In front of the platform, Party and national flags were crossed, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the center. Small Party and national flags were hung all around the stands of the pool, fluttering in the wind, bright and eye-catching. The fourth floor of the pool was surrounded by red ribbons, which shone in contrast with the green water. All equipment was neat and clean, leaving the audience in awe. A temporary wireless broadcast system was installed in front of the platform, and speeches and reports could be heard clearly throughout the pool.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>The ceremony began at 2:00 PM, with Lin Yannan as the master of ceremonies. After the Public Security Bureau band played music and the ceremony proceeded as planned, Mayor Wu delivered the opening speech, saying: "Distinguished guests, today is the opening ceremony of the Shanghai City Swimming Pool. I am deeply grateful for the presence of guests from all walks of life and extend a warm welcome. The swimming pool is one of the most important buildings in Shanghai's municipal sports venues. Construction began in November of last year and was completed in August of this year. The swimming pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, with a maximum depth of 11 feet and a minimum depth of 4 feet. The stands can accommodate over 4,000 spectators. The pool water is equipped with a filtration system that changes and disinfects the water every six hours. After the swimming pool opens today, exhibition matches will be held. Starting tomorrow, it will be open daily from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai can make full use of this swimming pool, as swimming is one of the main subjects in sports. There is an old Chinese saying that southerners are good at swimming, and northerners are good at riding. This may have been the case in the past due to the development of living habits, but today, both southerners and northerners should swim. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will make full use of the swimming pool and that their swimming skills will improve day by day. Shanghai is a very large city with over 3 million citizens, and one public swimming pool is not enough. I hope that public swimming pools can be built step by step in different districts within the possible scope of public financial resources to meet the needs of the citizens. Thank you very much for attending today's ceremony."</p>
<p>Ribbon Cutting and Water Entry</p>
<p>After the Mayor finished his speech, he personally went down the steps to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The guests applauded. Then Ms. Chen Baoxuan performed the water entry ceremony, diving into the water from the high diving board and swimming 50 meters freestyle. Immediately afterwards, team leader Peng Sanmei led over 30 male and female athletes in formation around the pool. The men wore black swimsuits, and the women wore yellow swimming caps and blue "Three Wheels" brand swimsuits. They circled half a lap around the pool, to the applause of the audience.</p>
<p>Exhibition Matches</p>
<p>Immediately following was the exhibition match. Of the original thirteen events scheduled, the blind swimming event did not take place. The results of each event were satisfactory. The 50-meter freestyle performance by six-year-old Yang Qiying attracted much attention from the audience, with a time of one minute, thirty-six and eight-tenths seconds. After the performance ended around 5:00 PM, guests from all walks of life were free to enter the pool, and everyone dispersed around 6:00 PM. Coach Peng Sanmei issued the starting commands for the exhibition match. In the first event, the men's 50-meter freestyle, Liang Yisheng won first place by a centimeter, followed by Huang Yuexiong and Zhang Rongguang, who were only about two inches apart. This is a new city record. Next was the women's 50-meter freestyle. Liu Wenxian led the way, while Jiang Aixian and Yang Chuanying tried their best to catch up. Ms. Liu reached the finish line with a lead of one and a half meters. In the women's 200-meter breaststroke, Jian Erjie had already surpassed the first person by more than two meters at 30 meters after entering the water. She finished with an excellent time of three minutes and seventeen and four-tenths seconds, setting a new Shanghai record. Next was the women's 50-meter breaststroke. Ms. He Wenjin, one of the three heroines newly arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao, also participated in the competition. Zhou Xiuling led by half a meter, Zhang Jiazhen was half a meter behind He, and Wu Juanjuan trailed. The 400-meter freestyle was one of the most exciting scenes yesterday. Shi Bogen led the way after the start, and reached the finish line 80 meters ahead of the second person, with a time of six minutes and eight seconds. The participants in the women's 50-meter backstroke were the Yang sisters and He Wenjing and Li Lingli from Qingdao. Yang Zhongying and He Wenjing competed fiercely, with Yang leading by half an arm. Jian Erming in the men's 100-meter backstroke went out of bounds, allowing Xu Shouqiang to lead by one arm to the finish line. Liang Weisheng and Huang Yuexiong fought fiercely in the men's 100-meter freestyle. In the last five meters, Liang leaped to the finish line, pushing Huang back about a foot, with a time of one minute and eight and eight-tenths seconds. Next, six-year-old Yang Qiying performed the 50-meter, with excellent form. Liu Suxian won the women's 100-meter freestyle again. The last was the 150-meter medley relay, with four groups participating. The strengths were balanced. The first group had a time of one minute and twenty-five and five-tenths seconds. The diving and artistic performances were not formal performances due to the lack of sturdiness of the diving boards. The performance ended at half past four, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>

<h3 id="e146">This City Participates in National Games Football Trial Match Yesterday: Blue Team Wins Over White Team 6-3 <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>To Whom Will the Football Championship Belong? In the current 6th National Games, it is indeed an important question worthy of exploration. According to reports collected from all parties, cities such as Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beiping, overseas Chinese, and Shanghai all have the same enthusiastic ambition to win the championship. Shanghai, by virtue of its home advantage, cannot be underestimated. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Football Team's first trial match yesterday was held under this mission at Zhongyuan.</p>
<p>Blue vs. White</p>
<p>Trial matches are different from ordinary matches; the purpose is to observe the individual skills of the players and the overall cooperation. The outcome is not important. Often, one team focuses on attacking, while the other team focuses on defending. For example, yesterday, the blue team focused on attacking, while the white team focused on defending. The blue team's five forwards were Wan Xianghua, Xu Wenshou, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, and Jia Youliang. Li Yichen and Mu Xing were deliberately held back, presumably to be used in the future. The five forwards performed well individually, but their cooperation was not yet perfect. However, it was not easy to see them perform like this for the first time. Looking to the future, there is reason to be optimistic. The white team focused on defense. The goalkeeper was originally scheduled to be Xu Heng, but his name was omitted from the list, so he did not attend, and Zhang Rongcai replaced him. The inner defenders Li Ning and Jiang Shanjing, the central defenders Xu Jingcheng, Shang Xiang, and Liang Shutang were in the first half. There were slight changes in the second half. Comparing the two, the former was more impressive. The white team once suffered a penalty outside the penalty area line. Li and Jiang stood side by side in front of the ball to form a human wall. The two forwards stood to the left and right of the goal, forming a triangle. The defender stood in the center of the goal, directly leaving the opponent with no way to shoot. This kind of arrangement had not been seen in Shanghai before and is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Trial Match Recap</p>
<p>The game started at 3:30 PM. After a long period of mixed play, Feng Yunyou, the central defender of the blue team, intercepted a ball halfway, picked it up, and sent it forward. Xu Wenkui met it head-on and shot back into the net. Following this, Dai Linjing took advantage of the fact that the entire white team was out, and the inner city was empty, and gently dialed it in again, making it 2-0. Before long, with the assistance of Chen Jiaqiu, Dai scored another goal. This was the most prosperous era for the blue team (attacking team). The white team reorganized its formation and stepped up its defense. The forwards also launched attacks several times, and finally Liu Zuxiu won back a goal. The first half ended 3-1. In the second half, the line-up changed dramatically. Zhong Yuxiang first scored a goal for the white team. Unexpectedly, Liang Shutang sowed the seeds of disaster and was penalized with a penalty kick. Chen Jiaqiu of the blue team did not miss, and the score became 4-2. In the last ten minutes, Xu Wenkui and Chen Jiaqiu of the blue team each scored a goal, and Liu Zuru of the white team also scored a goal. As a result, the blue team won 6-3.</p>

<p>The China Race Walking Association held a 25-mile race walking practice yesterday morning.

Wang Jingren and Dan Rongsheng dropped out successively on Nanyang Road and Route Frelupt. As a result, six people completed 17 miles, including Zheng Chengshan, Tang Wenyi, Zheng Dechang, Xie Hangdao, Shi Conghua, and Zhou Yinhua. Only three people finished the entire 25 miles: Cai Zhengyi, Zhang Zaojiu, and Ma Silong. Cai Zhengyi took 4 hours exactly, and Zhang Zaojiu took 4 hours and 4 minutes. The results are excellent.

<h3 id="e161">Ministry of Education Orders Sichuan Education Department to Handle Matters Concerning Provincial Agricultural College and Other Schools <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>According to an inspection report, the Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the Sichuan Provincial Education Department, stating roughly that: The Ministry had previously sent personnel to inspect the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural College, the Provincial Industrial College, the Sichuan Rural Construction College, and the Provincial Ceramics Vocational School. Based on the reports received and after detailed review, the actual conditions of operation of these colleges and schools do not match their reputations. Separate handling measures should be determined. Apart from previously "briefly informing by telegram" regarding the Agricultural and Industrial Colleges, further instructions are now given as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Sichuan Provincial Agricultural College</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the college currently has two departments, Agronomy and Forestry, with just over forty students. It has an affiliated high school with three classes. The regular funding is only over forty-six thousand yuan, which has not always been fully disbursed and is insufficient to cover salaries and expenses. Most of the teachers hold concurrent positions. The teaching materials rely solely on lectures, with no opportunities for practical training. The school buildings are dilapidated, and the equipment is extremely lacking. The practice fields are not utilized. The current state of the college is largely unsatisfactory. Starting from this year, it should be immediately merged into the National Sichuan University, combining the two departments into an Agronomy and Forestry Department. The university should rigorously reorganize the department, enrich the faculty and equipment to facilitate teaching. The original funding should be allocated to Sichuan University for its disposal. The school property and practical equipment should be received by the Provincial Department first, and then transferred to Sichuan University for management. The affiliated high school should be managed by the Provincial Department in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>2.  Sichuan Provincial Industrial College</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the college currently has three departments: Mechanical Engineering, Applied Chemistry, and Mining and Metallurgy, with seventy-three students. It has an affiliated high school with three classes. The regular funding is only sixty-two thousand yuan, which has often been largely reduced, with the largest portion used for new salaries and office expenses. The president and most of the teachers hold concurrent positions and are often absent at will. The teaching materials focus heavily on lectures while neglecting experiments. The students' level is very low, and the equipment is outdated and simple, no longer applicable. The college's operating conditions are largely inappropriate. Starting from this year, the funding should be allocated to Chongqing University for its disposal. The remaining school property and various equipment should be taken over by the Provincial Department and used to establish an industrial vocational school. The affiliated high school should also be managed by the Provincial Department in a coordinated manner.</p>
<p>3.  Sichuan Rural Construction College</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the organization of the college includes not only the college section but also a research and experimental department, an agricultural technology personnel training school, a rural education experimental zone, and an agricultural experiment field. The college's undergraduate program is divided into a Rural Society Department and an Agricultural Department, with only over fifty students. The entrance qualifications do not meet the standards. The students in the training school have a level equivalent to junior high school. The regular funding is allocated from the provincial education funds, totaling over one hundred thousand and two thousand yuan in the twenty-third fiscal year. The original purpose of establishing the college was to focus on rural construction work, which does not fall under the jurisdiction of educational administrative organs. Therefore, educational funds should not be used. Moreover, the use of the "College" designation is inconsistent with the organizational regulations of National Chung Hsing University. Starting from this year, it should change its name and purpose. Together with the agricultural experiment field, it should be transferred to the Construction Department or the Civil Affairs Department for management, with funding provided from the provincial treasury.</p>
<p>4.  Provincial Ceramics Vocational School</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the school has an undergraduate program and a practical training class. The undergraduate program has forty-nine students, and the practical training class has nineteen students. The entrance qualification is junior high school graduation. The length of study is one year for the practical training class and three years for the undergraduate program. The regular funding received is over seventeen thousand yuan from the province. The students lack practical training, and the internal management is poor. The school's structure is essentially that of a senior vocational nature and should not continue to use the "Vocational School" designation. Starting from this year, it should be immediately renamed Senior Ceramics Vocational School. The current principal's mismanagement should be addressed immediately, and specialized talent should be appointed to thoroughly reorganize the school. The order is issued to the Department to comply with and implement the instructions accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Songjiang County Education Bureau Director Shen's Reply to Chen Deqi's Letter Regarding the Joint Establishment of a Normal School by Seven Counties <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The newspaper recently reported on Chen Deqi's letter to the Songjiang County Education Bureau regarding the merger of the female normal schools of seven counties. Now, we have Director Shen's reply: "To My Respected Teacher Xipeng, I received your quick letter yesterday and respectfully learned of your concerns regarding the merger of the female normal schools of seven counties. This matter was decided at a meeting convened by the Education Department on August 21st, attended by the responsible personnel from the seven counties in the province. Before that, we had not received any other official documents to cease operations. The merged school is located in Huangdu Township, not Qixia Township. Your letter seems to contain a misunderstanding based on hearsay. Your letter states that local original funds should be used to operate local original undertakings. This is originally determined by the former Jiangsu Provincial Government, ‘using original funds in original places for original undertakings.’ I am also a son of one of the counties and will naturally follow the local elders and devote myself wholeheartedly. However, due to the Education Bureau's position, it is bound by the Department's decision to implement this case. However, I did not attend the provincial meeting due to illness. The meeting did not discuss the quota allocation for our county. At the concluding meeting convened by our bureau yesterday (the 7th) as ordered, I proposed that the original quotas of the seven counties should be maintained, that is, fourteen for Songjiang and seven for each of the other six counties. This has been passed and reported to the Department for record. I hope that it will be approved. This is something to comfort Teacher Chen Wu. Regarding your suggestion that it would be more convenient to merge with Songjiang County Normal School and your request for me to propose this, not only would the geographical relationship between the counties make it unlikely to be satisfactory, but the instructions had already been given, and there was no opportunity to propose it for discussion. I hope you understand. Other details are in the merger method and the minutes of the concluding meeting, which I enclose for your reference. I offer my respectful regards and wish you well. Respectfully yours, Shen Lianlu, September 4th."</p>
<p>Appendix (1) Merger Method: 1. In addition to the original funding of 4,000 yuan for Huangdu Township Normal School, the rest will be subsidized by provincial funds. 2. The students already enrolled in this session will be merged immediately. Thereafter, recruitment will be conducted once every four years, admitting both male and female students and raising the level of education. 3. Newly recruited public-funded students will be screened by Huangdu Township Normal School. Those not admitted will be allowed to study in county middle schools. 4. Private-funded students currently in the second year will be allowed to transfer to Songjiang County Normal School or the original first year of the seven-county township normal schools. Students currently in the first year will be sent to the provincial township normal schools of Wujiang, Huangdu, Louxia, or county middle schools. All will be admitted only if they pass the summer examination, and they will continue to pay tuition according to the original quota. (2) Minutes of the Concluding Meeting: Concluding meeting of the Joint Establishment of Female Normal Schools by Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Shanghai, Nanhui, Qingpu, and Chuansha Counties, September 2, 24th year. Attendees: Zhu Shijun, Jinshan; Shen Zhi, Shen Jixi, Chuansha; Gu Cuishi (representative); Wang Hongwen, Fengxian; Xu Jie (representative); Yuan Weiwen, Qingpu; Zhu Changlin, Shanghai; Chen Guobao, Nanhui; Zhang Jianqian (representative); Shen Lianbi, Songjiang; Liao (Director) of the Female Normal School. Chairman: Shen Lianbi. Recorder: Zhu Pi. Opening ceremony (omitted). Matters for Discussion: Item 1: The Department has stipulated a merger method, but only provides principles for the transfer of original first and second-year students. How should this be arranged to facilitate their enrollment as soon as possible? Decision: (1) The sixteen Songjiang students in the original second year will transfer to Songjiang County Normal School. The seven Qingpu students will transfer to the township normal schools of Kunshan, Qingpu, and Jiading. The three Jinshan students and four Shanghai students, three Fengxian students and three Nanhui students will transfer to the county normal schools in their respective locations. The one Wuxian and one Jiashan student(s) will also transfer to their respective county normal schools. The director of the Huangdu Township Normal School, Teng, stated that his school has fifteen vacancies in the third year and should immediately report for the right to transfer those students. (2) The original first-year students (now to be promoted to the second year) and the original second-year repeaters, totaling thirty-seven, will all transfer to Huangdu Township Normal School due to the inconvenient transportation to Wujiang Qixia. It should be immediately reported and requested that a second-year class be added at Huangdu Township Normal School to accommodate them. Otherwise, the Department should assign the students by name to the three township normal schools of Huangdu, Wujiang, and Qixia to avoid disputes. (3) The original first-year repeaters should be sent to Huangdu Township Normal School together with the public-funded students recruited in this session for screening. Those not admitted after screening, except for Chuansha County students who will transfer to Nanhui Girls' Middle School, will transfer to the county middle schools in their respective counties. The above points will be submitted to the Department for approval by the Songjiang County Education Bureau immediately. Item 2: Director Liao proposed, "Teacher contracts for this semester have already been issued. How should this be handled? Also, how should the 667.6 yuan already paid in August (with detailed accounts) and future payments be spent?" Decision: The issue of contracts will be reported to the Department for instructions. The funds to be spent in August and September should be allocated from the school's regular expenses for August, subject to approval by the Department, and the Songjiang County Education Bureau will report to the Department and implement the instructions. Item 3: Director Liao proposed, "The school's new buildings are under construction. What should be done in light of this change?" Decision: The entire construction funding was raised by Director Liao. Director Liao should handle it with due care. Item 4: How should the school buildings be kept safe and utilized? Decision: The Songjiang County Education Bureau will be responsible for the building's safe-keeping and utilization. If the seven counties need to use it for new undertakings in the future, it should be handed over for use. Item 5: The Department's merger method does not clearly specify the student quotas for the seven counties. Please discuss. Decision: Since the students of this grade are managed with the original funding of the seven counties merged into Huangdu Township Normal School as ordered by the Department, the student quotas should still follow the original method, with 14 for Songjiang and 7 for each of the other counties. These should be named as the "Public-Funded Students of the Former Song Dynasty's Seven Counties", and the Songjiang County Education Bureau should report it to the Department for record. Item 6: Director Liao proposed, "Various books and registers for student use were ordered from bookstores with the school's name printed on them and cannot be returned. How should this be handled?" Decision: The Songjiang County Education Bureau will send a letter to Huangdu Township Normal School to purchase and use them.</p>

<p>"Ned was crying so uncontrollably that he felt very sad, so we must not mention this matter again, okay?" the kind-hearted Tommo said.</p>
<p>"Of course we won't mention it again, but lying is really a bad thing;" Xiao Qiao's face seemed to show that the badness of this was now deepened, because the punishment did not fall on the offender, but on his good uncle, who was not guilty.</p>
<p>"If we move out of the way a bit, then Ned can run up the stairs if he wants to," Frant proposed, and he led the children to the granary, which was where they fled when they were in trouble.</p>
<p>Ned did not come down for dinner. Mrs. Shu brought some up to him to comfort him, which was beneficial to him, although he did not dare to look up at her. Later, the children playing outside heard the sound of a violin and said to each other; "He is better now." He was indeed better, but still embarrassed to run down until later, when he opened the door to sneak into the woods and suddenly found Xiaomei sitting on the steps, with no sewing work, no dolls, only her little handkerchief in her hand, as if she had shed many sympathetic tears for her imprisoned friend.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Promoting and Controlling the Transportation Network Plan <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shaozeng</p>
<p>A nation's transportation should have a complete plan and system. It is by no means enough to build some railways and highways, and open up some waterways and airways. Its distribution and organization must be like the human body's circulatory system, accessible everywhere, and connected at every point, forming a kind of transportation network to demonstrate its maximum efficiency. Otherwise, if there are phenomena of fragmentation, or only the pursuit of local development, the direct impact on the transportation industry and the indirect impact on the national economy will certainly not be insignificant.</p>
<p>However, the so-called transportation network cannot be created solely by a single transportation agency. The elements of a transportation network are three:</p>
<p>(1) Tightness in time: For example, when traveling from Route A to Route B, upon arriving at the end of Route A, one can immediately board a vehicle on Route B; or, when arriving at the destination station by railway, there are immediately highway buses or waterway ships to接运(pick up and transport) passengers and goods. Passengers are spared the tedium of sitting and waiting, and goods avoid the regret of altered quality or delayed sales opportunities. This is the effect of timeliness.</p>
<p>(2) Adjustment in space: For example, where there are waterways, no railways are built parallel to the waterways; where there are railways, no highways are built parallel to the railways. Efforts are made to distribute various transportation facilities evenly, so that one area does not feel congested with passengers and goods, struggling to cope; while the other area feels that there are too few passengers and goods, wasting capital. This is the effect of spatial adjustment.</p>
<p>(3) Adjustment in economy: For example, for goods that are large in quantity and transported to distant places, trains or ocean liners are used for loading and transporting; for small quantities transported to nearby places, trucks or inland river ships are used for loading and transporting; for small quantities that need to be delivered quickly, airplanes are used for loading and transporting. The same goes for passengers: for long distances, they can take trains, ocean liners, or airplanes; for short distances, they can take cars or inland river ships. The freight rates for passengers and goods are based on what merchants and passengers can afford, so that the economy in terms of time and cost can be considered, and each can be accommodated. This is the effect of economic adjustment.</p>
<p>However, to reap the benefits of timeliness and adjustment in transportation, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the transportation network, there are only two ways: one is the regulation of the transportation industry, and the other is the cooperation of various modes of transportation. The former relies on the government's overall planning, and the latter is the full connection of various modes of transportation themselves. The railway is the lifeline of transportation, and it should fulfill its part of the responsibility for the layout of the transportation network along the line. Therefore, in recent years, state-owned railways have been carrying out connecting transportation with various land, water, and air parties, step by step, sparing no effort, which is commendable.</p>
<p>However, past intermodal transport facilities cannot be said to have exhausted their capabilities, and there are still many areas to be improved and promoted in the future. The following are some of the major points:</p>
<p>(A) Improving Railway Intermodal Transport: Regarding the improvement of passenger intermodal transport, several points can be mentioned as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For passenger intermodal transport, the tightness of time is the most important. In the past, although the various railway lines have strived to connect train schedules through schedule network meetings, except for the direct crossing of the Yangtze River for the Shanghai-Beijing through train, which is not a problem, the connection of vehicles from other lines has not been completely tight. Further improvements should be made. Even if the plan for inter-railway passenger cars to cross tracks cannot be realized for a while, we should often plan to closely connect the schedules of intermodal transport with each other, so that passengers can obtain the greatest economy in terms of time.</p>
<p>(2) American railways also operate highways, on the one hand to seek the nourishment of the railway itself, and on the other hand to make it convenient for passengers to接运 (pick up and transport). If there is a need to build highways along the railway line in our country, and no other party can handle it for a while, then the railway may as well invest in it. Moreover, the highway operated by the railway itself radiates from the railway trunk line, which is especially beneficial for arranging the transportation network.</p>
<p>(3) Intermodal passengers mostly travel long distances. According to the current fare calculation, the longer the journey, the higher the cost. Therefore, unless they have huge assets or urgent matters, few are willing to take this route. In the future, in order to develop intermodal transport business, it is not advisable to give discounts on intermodal ticket prices or provide other conveniences to promote it.</p>
<p>(4) Intermodal passengers often need to stay in hotels after arriving at the connecting station or terminal station. If the place is a metropolis or commercial port, there is no problem; but if it is a remote town, it is very distressing to have no good accommodation. Therefore, the railway should pay attention to the hotel facilities at the intermodal connecting station or terminal station. If there is a lack of a suitable hotel in the area, the railway may as well run it itself. The scale does not have to be too large, but the facilities should be clean and tidy, so that passengers can feel at home.</p>
<p>(5) Railway passenger intermodal transport, in addition to the interconnection of domestic railway lines, must be further extended to foreign countries, in order to promote international tourism. Our country has famous mountains and scenic spots everywhere, which should be widely publicized, and intermodal sightseeing passenger cars should be set up to attract them, which will be of great benefit to the railway business and the national economy. Therefore, the intermodal transport between our country's railways and foreign railways or ships should also be actively prepared.</p>
<p>Regarding the convenience of freight intermodal transport, there are also several aspects that urgently need to be improved:</p>
<p>(1) To stipulate the travel time of freight cars. Although intermodal freight transport has been carried out on various lines, the travel dates have not been stipulated. It is often difficult for freight merchants to accurately estimate the arrival date of goods, so that the market price cannot be predicted. Therefore, the travel dates should be stipulated to increase the convenience of freight merchants, and it is also easy to调度 (dispatch) railway vehicles, so that they will not be wasted.</p>
<p>(2) To set special prices for intermodal transport of bulk goods. Because various lines have special price regulations for transporting bulk goods, only a few have special prices for intermodal transport goods. In the future, in order to seek practical cooperation in cloth transportation and sales, various lines should select the bulk goods produced and agree on special prices, so that supply and demand can be adjusted and prices can be balanced.</p>
<p>(3) To unify the calculation of freight. For example, the percentage of freight surcharges and the percentage of handling fees are different on each line, with some adding, some not adding, some adding 10%, and some adding 20%, which makes the freight calculation extremely complicated. Not only can freight merchants not check, but road staff also feel troubled by this. Therefore, it should be simplified to facilitate calculation and make it easy for freight merchants to understand.</p>
<p>(4) The loading and unloading fee should be collected together with the freight. The loading and unloading fees of various lines are determined according to the situation of their location. Although the amount is small, the system is extremely complicated. At present, as a temporary measure, the loading and unloading fees are temporarily collected by each line. For intermodal goods, the unloading fee paid by the sender is collected by the arrival station; and the loading fee paid by the recipient is collected by the departure station, but it cannot be filled in the freight bill, only a miscellaneous receipt is given. Therefore, all freight merchants must pay the loading and unloading fees for intermodal goods separately from the freight bill, which is not only troublesome, but also prone to overcharging. Therefore, the loading and unloading fee should be collected at the same time as the freight, so as to avoid separate payment by freight merchants, and to enable the consignee to pick up the goods only with the freight bill, without having to take into account the payment of loading and unloading fees, which will definitely increase a lot of convenience.</p>
<p>(B) Promoting Intermodal Transport by Water, Land, and Air: The purpose of railways and various land, water, and air parties in handling intermodal transport is nothing more than to form a flat and three-dimensional transportation network. The denser the organization and the wider the scope of this transportation network, the more it can demonstrate its great function. Therefore, in the future, all waterways and highways along the railway line, except those parallel to the railway, should be connected with it. We should also contact the air routes to organize intermodal transport; and in addition to passengers and luggage packages, we must also follow the examples of European and American countries and extend it to goods, so that the specialties of various places can expand the scope of transportation and sales, and achieve the purpose of corresponding supply and demand.</p>
<p>(C) Expanding the Service Scope of Business Offices: For the contact and transportation of luggage, parcels, and less-than-carload freight between inland areas and cities, the business office is actually its hub. Although several lines have now set up business offices, due to location relations, their service scope is still biased towards major cities, and has not been able to penetrate into inland towns. Therefore, in the future, all stations along the line should be uniformly implemented as business offices, that is, all service items of the business office should be handled concurrently by the staff of each station. In addition to selling passenger tickets, special attention should be paid to the往來運送(round-trip transportation) of luggage, parcels, and less-than-carload freight, and business office agencies should be set up everywhere in inland cities and towns to closely contact local shipping or汽軍(motorized military force, assumed typo) companies. All luggage, parcels, and less-than-carload freight transported in and out of the inland areas will be handled at a low cost, and all procedures for starting tickets, picking up goods, and划付欵項 (remitting funds) will be handled on their behalf. In this way, inland areas and cities will be營打成一片 (united into one), which will undoubtedly help to prosper the rural economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, examining a country's transportation, it is nothing more than four types: railway, waterway, highway, and airway. However, these four have their own natural strengths, and cannot be regarded as the same. Trains and ocean liners are suitable for long-distance travel and transportation of large quantities of perishable goods because of their high cost. Inland river boats and road vehicles are suitable for short-distance travel and transportation of small quantities of goods because of their lower cost. Airplanes are especially suitable for long-distance urgent travel and巡輸 (patrolling and transporting) of mail or valuables because of their particularly high speed. In addition to ordinary passenger and freight transportation, which contains economic relations, each also bears a national defense mission. Then, from the standpoint of the entire country, for these four types of transportation undertakings, we should seek to individually develop their natural strengths, so that they can help promote the prosperity of the national economy in peacetime, and can also express their national defense effectiveness in the event of an emergency. To achieve this, I believe that there are five points that should be paid close attention to:</p>
<p>(1) For various transportation undertakings, it is advisable to manage them in a unified way, so that the運價 (freight rates) of each and their mutual contact are regulated in order to achieve the effect of adjustment and avoid the drawback of being偏枯 (one-sided). Even if not, the administrative links in charge of transportation should also cooperate closely to協謀 (jointly plan) the balanced development of each transportation mode.</p>
<p>(2) For various transportation undertakings, it is advisable to treat them equally, not to助此以敵彼 (help this to defeat that), nor to益彼而損此 (benefit that and damage this); otherwise, the competition between them will inevitably become acute, resulting in a lose-lose situation. For example, in recent years, the United States has been专事援助 (specializing in assisting) waterways and highways, which has led to the衰疲 (decline) of railways. This is a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>(3) For the construction of railways, it is advisable to only build trunk lines, not branch lines, so as to concentrate elbow strength, fully extend the length of the railway, and connect important areas; and to将支綫之地位 (replace the position of branch lines), build highways to任 (take on) short-distance transportation. In this way, things will be twice as effective with half the effort, which is exactly in line with economic principles. The US railways did not have an overall plan beforehand, so there are now many conflicts between highways and railway branch lines, which are detrimental to both. Our country should not repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p>(4) For the construction of highways, it is advisable to have them纵横交错 (crisscross) with Qian (likely typo for rail) lines to form a transportation network, avoiding parallelism, or at least keeping a considerable distance apart; otherwise, if their起訖相同 (starting and ending points are the same) and the distance between them is very close, it will not only cause unfavorable competition between the two sides, but also, in terms of their individual effectiveness, I am afraid that they will not be able to充分表 (fully express) themselves.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding primitive transportation tools, it is advisable not to存姑息 (tolerate them), so as not to hinder the development of emerging transportation industries. Nowadays, world transportation is moving towards speed, distance, and safety. Our country should迎 (welcome)赶上 (catch up), eliminate the old and seek the new. When the new transportation industry is fully developed, the entire national economy will rely on it to prosper; otherwise,因噎廢食 (refraining from eating for fear of choking), the遗患 (hidden danger) will certainly not be insignificant.</p>
<p>In short, the various transportation industries in the country should相五联络 (mutually connect), and should never 相互妨 (hinder each other); should相互策應 (coordinate with each other), and should never相互背馳 (run counter to each other). Only by相互联络 (mutually connecting) and 策應(coordinating), can we mutually nourish, and exist in shared prosperity. Whether our country's transportation industry can obtain the greatest development and display the greatest effectiveness depends on this!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ultimate goal of the transportation network is to enable the public to obtain transportation services with the lowest cost and the highest efficiency. However, in order to achieve this goal, in addition to close cooperation among various transportation industries, the government authorities must also find ways to promote economic equality and enable them to develop their natural strengths evenly. What are the ways? For various transportation industries, if their position is important, whether directly or indirectly, they must be given appropriate assistance to enable them to progress together. That's one. The taxes (or burdens) of various transportation industries should be based on the amount of their capital and the situation of their business, and fair tax rates should be核定 (verified and determined). That's two. The運費 (freight rates) of various types of transportation are related to the burden of the public, and should be详细爲釐核 (carefully checked) according to the weight of their cost, so as to ensure that they are fair. That's three. For various types of transportation, we should stipulate business standards, such as the equipment should be complete and precise, the procedures should be simple and fast, and the treatment of passengers should be respectful and courteous, all of which must meet the standards, so as to ensure that the public obtains the greatest comfort and convenience. That's four. All of these are of great importance to the development and efficiency of connecting transportation, and must not be neglected.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Causes and Consequences of the Four Industry Disturbances in Wuxi <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>At the end of August, the four industries of vegetables, rice beans, oil mills, and fresh meat in Wuxi, due to fertilizer problems and tax issues, successively experienced shutdowns and petitioning disturbances. This caused a serious panic in the entire Wuxi's food supply. The following is a narrative of the factual process and the discussion of the contents.</p>
<p>1. A Summary of the Facts</p>
<p>(1) Vegetable Farming Disturbance: Recently, Zhou Zude, Xu Renyi, Huang Xiamin, and more than a dozen others, raised 10,000 yuan to organize Xieji Agricultural Co., Ltd.; under the business department, they also jointly organized Xieji Office with Longshun, Yuanda, Rongfa, Shengsheng, Fuchang, Jinsheng, Daming, Yiji, Baoxing, 等昌(etc Chang), Deji, Huinong, Zengnong, Rongxing, Zhifa, Ruirui, Xinghua, Linong, Liangyi, Yuantun, Haoji, Shengtai, Jinji, Delying, Huafa and other twenty-five fertilizer firms. The entire county's vegetable farming industry believed that the office monopolized fertilizers,操從居奇 (manipulated prices), and harmed agriculture. Therefore, on the afternoon of August 28, more than a thousand vegetable farmers from all districts gathered and marched to the county party headquarters and the county government separately to petition. They demanded that the licenses be revoked and that the office be ordered to disband. More than 300 vegetable farmers also went to the Xieji office to demonstrate, resulting in a conflict. On the morning of the 29th, farmers from vegetable gardens everywhere sent people to guard the entrances of the five city gates, prohibiting the sale of vegetables into the city and stopping transactions. On the 30th, the vegetable farms outside the city also unanimously stopped trading. By this point, all vegetable farmers in the city had stopped operating.</p>
<p>(2) Rice Bean Industry Disturbance: The local rice bean industry previously received an order from the Jiangsu Department of Finance to collect temporary business tax on wheat on behalf of customers. The industry believed that the flour mills collected wheat and had already levied unified tax, and that the sale of wheat by the industry was of a brokerage nature: collecting business tax on behalf of customers was actually difficult to implement. At the beginning of last month, they convened all members of the industry to discuss countermeasures; it was decided to write to the county chamber of commerce, appealing to the Ministry of Finance to quickly order the Jiangsu Department of Finance to withdraw the order to collect temporary business tax on wheat. The Ministry of Finance, according to the report, believed that the collection of business tax by brokers was a collection from the seller; and had nothing to do with the unified tax. The objection was rejected! The industry applied repeatedly; and the dispute remained unresolved. Therefore, on August 29, more than 130 grain firms in the industry! More than 500 representatives went to the county government to petition. It was heard that if there were no results, they would also deal with it by stopping business.</p>
<p>(3) Oil Mill Industry Disturbance: The Guangdong Provincial Government imposed a national additional tax on imported oil cakes to fund the construction of Sun Yat-sen University. It was set to collect 25 cents per burden, starting on September 1. This caused strong opposition from the oil cake and杂粮(miscellaneous grains) industry in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Kunshan and other places in the country. In addition to sending representatives to a meeting in Shanghai to organize a petition group to petition the central and southwestern governments and argue reasonably; at the same time, the national oil mill industry unanimously suspended work on August 31. Hengde and Runfeng, two oil mills in Wuxi, had already suspended work on August 31.</p>
<p>(4) Fresh Meat Industry Disturbance: The Wuxi slaughter tax collection office, because from September 1 last year to the end of August this year, was contracted by Lu Zongyi and other five executive committee members of the meat industry association; there were several twists and turns due to the tax amount problem. Later, the towel county chamber of commerce仲裁(arbitrated) the matter and provided a letter of proof; and a final decision was announced. However, there were occasional delays in the payment of the money; resulting in huge arrears of tax money; the tax money in various townships was greatly affected. After several negotiations, the collection office reported to the county government; and the county magistrate限期(set a deadline) for the tax money to be paid. The collection office believed that if the tax money was not rectified, the future would be unimaginable; so it was decided to implement point-by-point collection starting on September 1. The point-by-point collection method was announced. On the fresh meat industry side, it was believed that the owed tax had been限繳 (deadline to pay) by the county magistrate. There was no need to change the collection method. In order to express their opposition, the entire county's fresh meat industry unanimously suspended business starting on September 1.</p>
<p>The economic pathology of the above four industry disturbances, we analyze it below.</p>
<p>2. Vegetable Farming Disturbance</p>
<p>First, let's discuss vegetable farming. The remote cause of the vegetable farming shutdown was a political issue of sanitation. We can understand this by reading the original text of the Wuxi Autonomous First District Chief's reply to the vegetable farming industry.</p>
<p>"...(1) The government's crackdown on pit latrines aims to address the unlimited number of pit latrines in streets and alleys. This is not in line with public health; and also has an impact on the municipal appearance. Therefore, we are cracking down on the excess ones, and preserving the appropriate amount of toilets. It is not that we are filling up all pit latrines..."</p>
<p>The pit latrines in Wuxi are truly everywhere; there is no street without a pit; no alley without a toilet. The people have never known that it is harmful to sanitation; and the government has never known that it is detrimental to the appearance. It's just that customs are deeply ingrained and there is no way to improve! However, the power of administration increases and decreases with history. The party-化政治(party-based politics) in Wuxi has lasted longer than any warlord politics. The crackdown on pit latrines has also been more than once. Because the result of the crackdown is always书虎不成 (drawing a tiger but failing to make it resemble one). The biggest problem is that there are no proper arrangements for excrement. This time, the clever government did not announce the proper disposal method beforehand, but the arrangements made by the government beforehand can be understood from the petition submitted by the farmers to the district office after the matter expanded.</p>
<p>"...Our rural villagers have always used fertilizer; they buy it from the mountains and use it in their villages. It is heard that some entrust brokers to buy it on their behalf: This has continued to this day, and there has been no harm. Recently, there is a Xieji Office, which at the same time关向 (sent to) the county government to obtain twenty-five licenses from Rongfa and other brokers. On the one hand, it cracks down on private pit latrines; on the other hand, it publicly announces in newspapers..."</p>
<p>The organization of fertilizer firms originally required first obtaining a license from the local competent authorities; and then it could operate. According to the investigation of the local newspaper, there were originally thirteen licenses for fertilizer firms in Wuxi; later, the firms gradually closed down: up to now, only eight licenses remain. This time, because of the organization of the Xieji Office, they simultaneously suddenly向(sent to) the county government to obtain eighteen new licenses. Together with the old licenses, there are a total of twenty-six licenses. From the viewpoint of the factual observation of "simultaneously suddenly obtaining licenses"; it is not difficult to depict the government's 사전(prior) arrangement. Then, the Xieji Office is just a 焦(likely typo for 點, dot) that caused the recent cause of the disturbance.</p>
<p>3. Rice Bean Industry Disturbance</p>
<p>Next, let's discuss the rice bean industry. The petitioning disturbance of the Wuxi rice bean industry this time was purely a political issue of taxation. The main cause of this problem can be said to be entirely a reflection of the economic pathology of the rice bean industry itself. Before this problem is solved, let's first discuss whether wheat business tax should be levied on brokers. In the past, the Jiangsu Provincial Government's opinion on the collection of business tax was that for wheat flour that had already been levied an ex-factory tax, if the flour mill set up offices in the interior to collect wheat; the provincial government considered it a trading act. In fact, the flour mill sends people to collect wheat, not for sale; but to make wheat flour. The two procedures are only two sections of one business. Buying wheat is the first part, and manufacturing flour and shipping it out of the factory is the latter part. Since the central government has already levied one, the local government must not re-levy the other. Later, the Ministry of Finance stipulated a method of exemption, and this kind of dispute was resolved. However, the sale of wheat by grain firms cannot be regarded as the same example; because they buy on one hand and sell on the other hand. Even if they buy on behalf of the flour mill, they will inevitably extract commissions. This kind of behavior is obviously two trading acts. The two sections of the one business activity of the flour mill sending personnel to collect wheat; are of course not the same. Then; why did the Wuxi rice bean industry know that it was two trading acts and still cause a petitioning disturbance? His predicament is not difficult to understand. Because the rice bean industry itself審 (examines) the internal cause of its own economic pathology; at this time and in this place, it is absolutely impossible to bear this legal tax. Assuming that the rice bean industry did not have an internal economic pathology; perhaps this petitioning disturbance would not have happened at all. Looking at Wuxi's rice market this year, it is the most depressed market since there has been a rice market. Foreign rice is accumulating; and rice prices are falling. It is predicted that by the end of this year, the entire county's rice industry will definitely shrink as a whole. This internal reason is hoping for government support. But unexpectedly,漏 (typo, should be 又) it was also hit by heavy rain, making this legal tax; become a苛政 (oppressive government) that disturbs the people and troubles businesses at this time and in this place.</p>
<p>4. Oil Mill Industry Disturbance</p>
<p>The shutdown of the Wuxi oil mill this time was entirely激動 (triggered) by the cause of畸形(abnormal) politics. This disturbance has spread across the country, and the farmers in Wuxi are also paying very close attention; because oil cake is the raw material for壅田(mounding fields) and feeding pigs. It is closely related to agricultural production. From the telegrams sent by industry associations in various places, it can be seen that the reason why this tax should not be levied has been discovered. But on the government side, it seems that they still don't know; even if they know, it seems that they only know that it is, but not why! It is clear that only imported fertilizer should be taxed, how can domestic goods also be forcibly pulled in together. Therefore; the economic pathology of the oil mill industry disturbance is a reflection of political disunity.</p>
<p>5. Fresh Meat Industry Disturbance</p>
<p>Finally, let's discuss the shutdown of the fresh meat industry. It is even more so to explain the internal causes of agricultural bankruptcy and falling prices. The market price of fresh meat in Wuxi is seven catties per yuan. Farmers think that raising pigs is unprofitable, and they are bringing all their piglets to the city; to sell them as soon as possible. Therefore, the supply of fresh meat exceeds demand; and the market price is increasingly weak. The fresh meat誧 (likely typo, shops) in order to get rid of current goods, are trying their best to sell meat貨(goods) on credit. This has led to a shortage of cash; poor turnover, and the outstanding slaughter tax money cannot be paid. In order to maintain their tax revenue, the slaughter tax collection office has no choice but to use the method of point-by-point taxation for relief. But on the fresh meat industry side, there are bound to be two difficulties that are difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>(1) Point-by-point taxation will inevitably require daily payment; and there is no room for overdue concessions. But in this depressed fresh meat industry, they may not be able to afford it financially.</p>
<p>(2) The previously slightly owed slaughter tax will cause difficulties in清償(clearing) it.</p>
<p>With these two layers of national difficulty; there is an expression of opposition to the shutdown.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion</p>
<p>The occurrence of the above four industry disturbances; were all激盪 (triggered) by political reasons. The damage of these disturbances to the national economy is extremely great. If we had reliable statistics, the losses this time would definitely be very alarming. Now our hope is;</p>
<p>(1) On the side of various industries, fortunately, do not use this uneconomical means of shutdown again as a tool to maintain your own economic organization.</p>
<p>(2) When good politics are implemented, I hope that various industries will be willing to accept some small委曲(grievances); and do not deal with them by uneconomical means. Otherwise, we must also try our best to avoid expressing ourselves by harming our own economic organizations.</p>
<p>(3) I hope that the government authorities. When implementing policies, must take this time and place as the premise. Never cause the public to have uneconomical misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Recently, the silver dollar situation seems to have entered a sluggish state again. The discount is already felt to be insufficient, and entry and exit will inevitably be difficult, leading to a sluggish market and no progress. Yesterday was again Sunday, a bank holiday, and the atmosphere was even more bleak. The exchange rate for silver dollars remained at one dime and five cents in the morning and afternoon, the same as before. In discount ticket transactions, over 3.1 million were transferred in the morning market, over 300,000 were newly traded, over 200,000 were traded in the afternoon market, over 300,000 were traded in the Small General Association, over 300,000 were traded in silver dollar mortgage redemptions, over 500,000 were issued in banknote secret-mark coupons, over 39 million were cleared in private bank silver dollar public bills, over 400,000 were remitted via land routes, 150,000 came from customer routes, 100,000 were for stomach. In addition, such as clearing, etc., were suspended as usual due to bank closures. As for subsidiary coins, although there were occasional fluctuations, the situation was still stable. Jiangnan small silver dollars were both 833 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous market, with no transactions reported in either the morning or afternoon markets. Guangdong small silver dollars opened at 7 dimes and 465 cents in the morning market, rising to 7 dimes and 475 cents in the afternoon market, ultimately being 1 yuan and 7 dimes higher than the previous market. Transactions amounted to 115,000 dimes in the morning market and 30,000 dimes in the afternoon market. Copper coins were at 338,000 cash, 2,000 cash shorter than the previous market, with a transaction volume of 29,406 strings of cash, equivalent to 8,600 yuan in foreign dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Last Week, the Bond Market Saw More Activity Only from the Northern Brokers <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from September 2nd to 7th, the public bond market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange can be described as peaceful. Market prices did not fluctuate greatly, and trading also decreased significantly, generally remaining in a stagnant state. Large traders rarely entered the market, and the Northern brokers were more active, with contract number 48 sometimes long and sometimes short, mostly absorbing short-term gold and Zhengliu bonds, while the rest were mostly sold short. The market trend was bearish, so the difference between forward and spot prices was significant, making arbitrage transactions impossible. It was quite cheap to transfer long positions, and market prices could gradually rise in the future due to this, and arbitrageurs would arise, then the market price would tend to rise, and only then would there be power. However, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the end of September will soon arrive, so market prices are still difficult to rise, but with too many shorts, prices are sold as soon as they rise, so it is not easy to fall sharply, and the future trend may still be stagnant. Over the past week, Northern brokers sold on Monday, with the larger amounts selling at half a yuan less, on Tuesday there was a sudden rumor that Rothschild expressed extremely well, and buying surged, and there was an immediate rebound, rising from 12 cents to 65 cents, on Wednesday the Guangdong Bank closed, and the market price was not concerned, the trend was chaotic, with both highs and lows, and the amounts were also small, on Thursday the stagnation increased, the market situation became more stagnant, trading was extremely light, and the trend was slightly stronger, on Friday there was a rumor of increased issuance of banknotes, and the banknote policy may be realized, and the Northern brokers covered their shorts significantly, Zhengliu rose 6 cents, and the rest also rose by 35 cents, and on Saturday it returned to stagnation, sometimes up and sometimes down, and the result was slightly weaker, the result of the week's market price was an increase of 12 cents to 56 cents, the total number of transactions was 43,971,000 yuan, the results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left, (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with price changes in various months ranging from a drop of 1 to a rise of 4 points. The market situation was relatively active. Traders bought near-month cotton, cotton farmers hedge sold distant-month cotton, and the government sold October cotton in New York and bought July cotton in New Orleans. Later, due to the upcoming government report, longs took profits, and the market weakened slightly. However, the wheat market and the stock market were strong, and the market was still stable. Finally, hedge selling increased, and prices fell again. Spot demand was quite good, with the spot price falling by 5 points. Futures fell by 5 to 8 points. English cotton spot price rose by 1 point, futures rose by 4 to 6 points. Indian cotton initially declined due to new buyers reselling, then rebounded due to good news from Liverpool. Pingle and Bairo Creek remained unchanged, and Omlah rose by one-quarter of a rupee. The original telegram is on the left, (dated 7th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairo Creek cotton on the 9th is 195 rupees, down 2 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of supply from various groups were more abundant than before, with about thirty odd suppliers, totaling over 6,000 piculs of goods. Sales in this street were stagnant and did not improve. Only the Qingdao group purchased three to four hundred bags. Sellers wanted to unload their goods, but there was only one way, to lower prices. As a result, the market immediately started to fall, and various broken japonica rice prices fell by 10 to 20 cents, late rice fell by 30 to 40 cents. All new japonica rice also fell by 20 to 30 cents, while the prices of Yangchuan and other new high-grade rices continued to plummet by 2 chi due to an imbalance between supply and demand.</p>

<p>Sufficient quantity of white tung oil is being sold less and less, while various foreign firms in Hankou are still trying their best to search for it. However, prices are rising higher and higher. At the end of the previous week, it was still selling for 52 yuan and 5 dimes per picul, but entering this past week, it was like a kite with a broken string, soaring straight into the sky, from 53 yuan to 54 yuan, to 55 yuan, to 57 yuan, to 58 yuan, and finally, as of Saturday, it had been sold to 60 yuan. The soaring price is unstoppable, and the market atmosphere believes that 70 yuan is just around the corner. Although various foreign firms are trying to adapt, they are also buying insufficient quantities. However, when sufficient quantities are available, they are still competing for them, resulting in an unprecedented surge, creating an unprecedented situation in the market, which is truly one of the most glorious pages in the history of tung oil.</p>

<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The pulse's movement entirely depends on the heart's movement. The heart's movement consists of a contraction and an expansion. During contraction, the blood stored in the heart chambers is forced out and enters the vessels, causing them to expand. Simultaneously, the blood within the vessels moves forward. This is the true principle of the pulse's movement. When the heart doesn't move, neither does the pulse; the number of movements of the heart equates to the number of movements of the pulse. This is true not only for the radial artery at the cun, guan, and chi positions of both hands, but for all arteries throughout the body. All arteries that can be felt by hand, such as the anterior auricular artery, the dorsalis pedis artery, and the carotid artery, can be pressed to verify this empirically. However, when the heart is extremely weak, each contraction expels only a small amount of blood, insufficient to cause a noticeable expansion of the blood vessels, thus no pulse can be felt. Therefore, there are instances of the heart moving but the pulse not moving (modern medicine calls this pulseless contraction). There has never been a case of the pulse moving when the heart doesn't move. Therefore, intermittent pulse is nothing more than intermittent heart activity. It is truly because the heart's movement is interrupted. Why does the heart move? Because it is stimulated. How can the heart contract when stimulated? Because muscles, when stimulated, can contract, and the heart is composed of muscles, so it also contracts when stimulated. Why does the heart's movement stop? Because the stimulation is abnormal, or the pathways transmitting the stimulation are obstructed. The heart is just a small object, so stimulating it should affect the entire heart. Why must there be transmission pathways? Because the heart is divided into upper and lower sections; the upper part consists of the left and right atria, and the lower part consists of the left and right ventricles. Both the atria and ventricles are muscular, but they are separated by connective tissue, each independent and not connected. Therefore, there must be transmission devices so that stimulation in one area can be transmitted to another. Now we know that the heart's stimulation originates from the sinus venosus, located in the upper half of the right atrium, near the entry point of venous blood into the right atrium. Stimulation here is transmitted to the ventricles via transmission pathways, so atrial contraction is followed by ventricular contraction. Ventricular contraction is necessary for blood to be expelled, so the pulse's movement entirely depends on ventricular contraction, and the heart's contraction entirely depends on stimulation. Additionally, there is a special state that must be understood. During the heart's contraction and early expansion phases, if external stimulation is applied to the heart again, the heart will not respond at this time, so it will not contract again. This is called the "refractory period," and this phenomenon has a great relationship with the explanation of intermittent pulse.</p>
<p>The heart's original stimulation, originating near the sinus venosus, has a fixed and unchanging duration, so the heart's contraction and relaxation are orderly. Now, if a special stimulation occurs in the ventricles, not periodically and not within the refractory period, the heart will be stimulated and contract again, and the pulse will arrive again. This contraction is shorter in time than the previous normal contraction, so the pulse arrives twice in succession. After the premature contraction, the normal stimulation arrives again, but if it falls within the refractory period, the heart will not be affected, so it cannot cause contraction. Contraction must wait for the next normal stimulation, so the resting time is longer, and the pulse stops. In general, the pulse is like "arriving twice in succession with a slight pause." The old saying that the intermittent pulse can return on its own is "a slight pause followed by two successive arrivals," which is incorrect. If one normal contraction and one premature contraction arrive alternately, it will seem like "a slight pause followed by two successive arrivals," but in essence, it is still just "arriving twice in succession with a slight pause." The old saying reversed the order. In light of this, the old saying that the pulse that stops but can return on its own is an intermittent pulse is actually the ventricular premature contraction of today. However, when premature contraction arrives, if the amount of blood contained in the ventricles is still very small, then even if the heart contracts, the amount of blood expelled is insufficient to cause a clear expansion of the artery, becoming the pulseless contraction described above, and the subsequent normal contraction is obscured by the refractory period. One must wait for the next normal contraction to see the pulse, so the time without a pulse is even longer. Because there is no phenomenon of two successive arrivals, it feels like one pulse is missing when palpated. The old saying calls this unable to return on its own, calling it an alternating pulse. In fact, although the pulse is like this, listening to the heart clearly reveals the sound of premature contraction, which can prove it. The old method of distinguishing between intermittent and alternating pulses based on whether the pulse that stops can return on its own to predict good or bad outcomes. Little did they know that merely feeling the pulse without listening to the heart, even if the heart can return on its own, the pulse may be like it cannot return! This is something the old doctors discussing the pulse could not have dreamed of.</p>
<p>Atrioventricular Conduction Block occurs when the pathway from the atria to the ventricles is obstructed. In mild cases, the function of transmission from the atria to the ventricles is not very sensitive, and the transmission time is prolonged. Therefore, the distance of each heart contraction gradually increases, until a certain point when the ventricles do not respond to the stimulation from the atria. At this time, the pulse stops and misses one beat. After a short pause, the transmission function returns to its original state, so the distance of contraction temporarily shortens somewhat, and then gradually lengthens again, until it no longer responds and stops. Therefore, the pulse of this condition is inevitably slow, which aligns with the "palpate it and it comes slowly" mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing. After the pause, the subsequent pulse comes faster than before. This is also what is called returning on its own, which also aligns with Zhang Zhongjing's description of intermittent yin pulse. Therefore, atrioventricular conduction block is also Zhang Zhongjing's intermittent pulse. (For details, refer to "Critique of Huang Han Medicine".) (End of Typhoid Fever, Part Five)</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(67) Laryngeal Tuberculosis and Laryngeal Syphilis</p>
<p>(Q) What is laryngeal tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) It is tuberculosis of the larynx secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis (consumption); primary laryngeal tuberculosis is rare.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the initial symptoms of laryngeal tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) The patient has a stubborn, incurable hoarseness, cough, and phlegm.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens later?</p>
<p>(A) Complains of sore throat, with pain worsening when swallowing; ulcers appear in the larynx. If the ulcer is in the arytenoid cartilage region, the pain radiates to the ear; if the ulcer is in the anterior wall of the pharynx and epiglottis region, then the pain occurs when swallowing.</p>
<p>(Q) Do patients with laryngeal tuberculosis have any unusual speech?</p>
<p>(A) The voice changes; after the ulcer appears, there is "loss of voice."</p>
<p>(Q) Can other symptoms be combined with laryngeal tuberculosis at the same time?</p>
<p>(A) Often complicated by glottic edema and chondritis of the larynx.</p>
<p>(Q) When diagnosing, what types of throat diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(A) It should be distinguished from laryngeal syphilis and laryngeal cancer.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis for patients with laryngeal tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) Most are incurable.</p>
<p>(Q) How is it treated?</p>
<p>(A) First, patients should be prohibited from talking and smoking; pay attention to overall nutrition.</p>
<p>(Q) What medications are used locally in the larynx?</p>
<p>(A) Apply peppermint oil (20%) or lactic acid solution (25-30%) to the throat. Cocaine solution can be used for pain relief.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any internal medications?</p>
<p>(A) Take calcium agents or creosote internally. Inject calcium gluconate.</p>
<p>(Q) What should be done if the patient has difficulty breathing due to swelling of the throat?</p>
<p>(A) A tracheostomy must be performed.</p>
<p>(Q) What is laryngeal syphilis?</p>
<p>(A) That is, during the second stage of syphilis, condyloma lata appear in the larynx, resulting in conjunctivitis, congestion, and redness, even glottic edema. Or in the third stage, gummas form in the arytenoid cartilage and vocal cord region, destroying tissue and forming ulcers in the larynx. This is called laryngeal syphilis.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of laryngeal syphilis?</p>
<p>(A) Like laryngeal tuberculosis, it causes hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any complications when suffering from laryngeal syphilis?</p>
<p>(A) Often complicated by perichondritis of the larynx and glottic edema.</p>
<p>(Q) When diagnosing laryngeal syphilis, what diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(A) It should be distinguished from laryngeal tuberculosis and cancer.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for laryngeal tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(A) Nothing more than the administration of anti-syphilitic therapy, which includes injections of 606, 914, mercury, and bismuth, internal administration of iodine, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e185">High Blood Pressure and Arteriosclerosis (Part 2) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yueqi</p>
<p>—Medical Story No. 9—</p>
<p>Another hypothesis is based on such a commonly known fact that people with high blood pressure have very clear changes in the kidneys. So some people imagine that because, in such a situation, the kidneys do not eliminate all wastes in the body, so some kind of waste remaining in the blood causes blood vessels to contract and move throughout the body. However, it is very difficult to find any waste in the body that has this kind of property. The famous Doctor Batty-Shaw of Tuton resolutely stated some years ago that there are no intermediate products of nutrients that can cause blood vessels to contract. But Major discovered not long ago that Guanidine, which is formed by the disintegration of protein food, contains this kind of material.</p>
<p>Major also discovered that injecting liver extracts can lower blood pressure, and its effect lasts for a long time. The theory on which this discovery is based is like this: We know that the liver is related to the production of uric acid. Uric acid is probably made from some intermediate products such as "guanidine" by the liver. For some reason, the liver cannot make uric acid from these products, so they continue to circulate in the blood. We know that they will increase blood pressure. Liver extracts in the blood will synthesize them into non-toxic uric acid, so the materials that increase blood pressure are eliminated from the blood, and the blood will also fall.</p>
<p>However, doctors with diagnostic experience will rise up to argue against this hypothesis: If "guanidine" is the cause of high blood pressure, then why does "guanidine" only begin to work at the age of fifty or sixty? Also, if this is caused by bad teeth, then some people have bad teeth at a young age, but high blood pressure must wait until they are fifty or sixty years old before it starts.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, high blood pressure is a hereditary disease. In the eyes of ordinary people, doctors do not need to spend much thought on this kind of observation. In fact, on the contrary, for various reasons, this is one of the most difficult topics to reach. Think about it: any doctor only lives one lifetime; therefore, it is difficult for him to observe the diseases of parents and children at the same age. Of course, the patient will tell him the parents’ symptoms and the cause of death: but the doctor is quite difficult to believe such narratives! Partly because he does not believe the patient’s description of his own symptoms, and partly because the patient often frankly expresses suspicion about the parents’ diseases. Moreover, modern doctors do not completely agree with the conclusions that biology has reached regarding heredity.</p>
<p>Only one hypothesis is consistent with all situations, because it is in line with the latest conclusions regarding "creation." This hypothesis is that protoplasm has a tendency, that is, at a certain stage of an individual's life, certain body cells! Such as the aorta, the membranes of blood, etc., and the microvessels of the kidneys, etc.! Certain changes will occur. Under this hypothesis, we can infer that high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis are only a physiological law of aging in the human body.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment, the only valuable treatment is to adjust the general lifespan by reducing the pressure applied to the blood vessels. In this way, lifespan can indeed be extended for several years. But the so-called reducing the pressure on blood vessels does not mean that all activities in the world should stop. It is a huge mistake to measure the improvement of human life by recording falling blood pressure, or to imagine that this is possible. Some doctors have measured the blood pressure of the parties involved in life insurance companies over the years. This is a dull and monotonous occupation. But they also gained several benefits from this. One is that they learn what situations can be affected by treatment and what situations are not affected. In general, high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis are difficult to treat. In New York, in Chicago, in Vienna, in Berlin, in Paris, and in London, various methods of treating high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis have been tried, but none have been effective.</p>
<p>In short, changes in blood pressure have nothing to do with health. People with higher blood pressure are not necessarily weaker than those with lower blood pressure. High blood pressure is not a disease, but just a physiological adjustment. Clindening published an interesting piece of advice in "The Human Body" saying:</p>
<p>"It is best not to let people over the age of fifty know their blood pressure records, because this will cause unpleasant news. Don't give up your work, your entertainment, or, for women, don't give up your political campaigns. Life is for living, for complete happiness and activity. You must not look at the mercury shaking in the glass tube with fearful eyes and let the flame of life go out unnaturally."</p>

<p>Plant</p>
<p>Originally from Europe, cultivated in drylands, a biennial herb. Roots are fleshy, growing straight down. Stems are about 1-1.5 meters tall. Leaves have long petioles, broad and heart-shaped, with dentate edges. The underside of the leaves is densely covered with cottony hairs. Terminal corymbose inflorescences bear purple flowers in summer, consisting solely of tubular florets forming a head.</p>
<p>Crude Drug</p>
<p>Burdock Fruit (Aggressive Seed) *Fructus Bardanae* is harvested from the fruit of the burdock plant, and is oblong, slightly curved, about 5 mm long, and no more than 2 mm wide. The exterior has prominent grey ridges, with an oily odor and a slightly bitter taste.</p>
<p>Components</p>
<p>The roots contain inulin (45%) and fats, with the general composition as follows (% in dried product): crude protein 12.3, ash 3.6, carbohydrates 69.0, crude fat 0.82. Fresh roots contain approximately 73% water. The fruit contains 25-30% fat, and the leaves contain mucilage, tannins, and essential oils (0.03%).</p>
<p>Medicinal Use</p>
<p>Traditionally, burdock is said to have diuretic effects and is used for edema or sore throats, fresh sores, and poisons from venomous insects and snakes. The daily dose is 8 grams, prepared as a decoction. An example prescription is Burdock Fruit Decoction, which is effective for various throat pains: Burdock Fruit 8.0, Scrophularia, Rhinoceros Horn, Cimicifuga, Scutellaria, Akebia, Platycodon, and Licorice, each 4.0. The above is a decoction of 200.0, taken three times a day after meals. In European folk medicine, burdock root (*Radix Bardanae*, English/American/German) has long been used as a diuretic or for syphilis and mercury poisoning.</p>

<p>Part Four: Lymphogranuloma Venereum</p>
<p>2.  Swelling of the Inguinal Lymph Nodes: This is a characteristic symptom. Approximately three to four weeks after infection, swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes can be palpated, also known colloquially as "groin buboes." The onset of this swelling is slow, and its course is protracted, one of its distinguishing features. The swelling begins as being the size of a broad bean or a fingertip, and then gradually grows to the size of a goose egg or a fist. Each lymph node develops separately, without coalescing, a second distinguishing feature. When the swollen lymph nodes adhere to the skin, the skin appears flushed. As the disease progresses further, the centers of the glands soften, gradually ulcerating and discharging pus, forming multiple non-fusing fistulous tracts. This is a third distinguishing feature. Around the softened lesions, the proliferation of granulation tissue is often palpable as a raised, hard glandular tissue, a fourth distinguishing feature. Recurrent bouts of fever are a fifth distinguishing feature. As for other systemic symptoms, they are milder than those associated with chancroidal buboes, but their course is more prolonged.</p>
<p>3.  Symptoms Beyond the Inguinal Lymph Nodes: Among these, lesions of the external genitalia and perineum, especially in the anus and rectum of women, are primary, due to the different distribution of lymph nodes compared to men. I will now describe this in detail:</p>
<p>A. Elephantiasis of the External Genitalia: In women, the labia majora and minora swell and subside irregularly, ultimately leading to elephantiasis-like thickening. In men, the prepuce and penis swell and harden, resulting in phimosis or abnormal enlargement of the penis. All of these are due to lymphatic fluid stagnation caused by inflammation of the accessory glands.</p>
<p>B. Perineal, Anal, and Rectal Symptoms: Lymph from the female genitals does not flow into the inguinal glands but rather into the pelvic cavity and the rectal wall. Therefore, in clinical practice, swelling of the lymph nodes in the deep labia of the perineum, the anal region, and the rectal wall is commonly seen, or they may form hard infiltrations, and also suppurate, becoming fistulous tracts. Conversely, lesions of the inguinal lymph nodes are less common. Furthermore, lesions of the rectal wall often cause rectal stricture due to scar contraction after fistula healing, leading to constipation or stools as thin as sheep intestines. Alternatively, persistent unhealed fistulae may discharge mucous and bloody stools, leading to suspicion of hemorrhoidal fistulae or hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>B. Diagnosis: The characteristic state of glandular swelling is the diagnostic marker, such as hard cords, localized central suppuration of the glands, slow progression, all of which are key diagnostic points. However, there may also be a lack of characteristic signs, such as elephantiasis of the external genitalia, or atypical symptoms involving the anorectal region. Therefore, accurate diagnosis relies on the so-called Frei test.</p>
<p>The Frei test, discovered by Frei in 1925, is essential for differentiating this condition. Its procedure is similar to the Benshade method. Knowledge of this test belongs to specialists, so it will not be described here in detail.</p>
<p>The following should be discussed in the differential diagnosis:</p>
<p>A. Syphilitic Bubo: Can be distinguished by its non-suppurating nature, the presence of an initial chancre in the genital area, a positive test for *Treponema pallidum*, and a positive Wassermann test.</p>
<p>B. Gonorrheal Bubo: Can be distinguished by its acute course, severe subjective symptoms, and the co-occurrence of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>C. Chancroidal Bubo: Can be distinguished by its acute course, marked redness, pain, fever, and the presence of a chancroid in the genital area.</p>
<p>D. Hemorrhoidal Fistulae and Hemorrhoids: Should be differentiated in atypical cases beyond the inguinal lymph nodes. This can be done by considering the more severe local changes in lymphogranuloma venereum, the induration or ulceration around the fistulous tracts, a positive Frei skin reaction, and an inquiry into the patient's history.</p>
<p>C. Treatment and Prevention: Treatment of this disease includes bed rest, local dressings, incision, radiation, the administration of astringents and alteratives, and specific antigen injection therapy. In addition, the intravenous injection of sulfonamide drugs has proven quite effective. Prevention can be based on general methods for preventing venereal diseases. (End of full text)</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Can Pulmonary Tuberculosis Be Cured?</p>
<p>Whenever pulmonary tuberculosis treatment is mentioned, I think everyone must ask: Can pulmonary tuberculosis really be cured? This question is undoubtedly complex and difficult to answer easily, but various facts point undeniably towards an affirmative answer. We must understand that among ordinary pulmonary tuberculosis patients, even those with tubercle bacilli detected in their sputum, cases of complete recovery without recurrence are frequently seen in clinical practice. Furthermore, there is much clear evidence in pathological anatomy. In corpses that died from other diseases, old tuberculous lesions are often found at the apex of the lungs; inside the caseous bronchial glands there are also calcareous remnants. All of this sufficiently proves that the recovery of pulmonary tuberculosis is beyond doubt. In this well-managed tuberculosis, the fibrous connective tissue around the lesion is particularly abundant. As for the caseous matter, it is sealed off to prevent the spread of tubercle bacilli. The more the fibrous connective tissue is produced, the more firmly the caseous matter is sealed off. As a result, small lesions are mostly completely curable. However, these sealed and surrounded lesions can easily cause a recurrence of the disease if the opportunity arises. Although this recurrence does not necessarily account for the majority, the possibility exists for every patient. The time is also uncertain; even old lesions of more than ten years are treated the same way. Moreover, even if the lesion here is in a state of recovery, it can occur elsewhere. Therefore, whether pulmonary tuberculosis can be cured is not a question. But to what extent can we say that it will not recur? No one can answer this question.</p>

<p>Headache</p>
<p>Headache is a very common ailment. Some people suffer from frequent headaches, while others experience them occasionally. Because it is such a common problem, countless individuals make a living by manufacturing and selling headache remedies. Before the age of scientific medicine, when people had headaches, they simply took whatever medicine someone told them was effective, without asking why they had the headache or how the remedy worked. Not only patients acted this way, but also those who called themselves physicians. The fundamental mistakes were: First, not knowing why the headache occurred; second, not knowing how the pain reliever worked. Now is the age of scientific progress. For any disease, we must first understand the cause. We must also know the chemical composition of the medicine we take, how it works inside the body, how it enters the body, and how it is excreted. This way, we can both prevent headaches and treat them with appropriate or fundamental methods. I will briefly describe the causes of headaches and the principles of treatment:</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there is a reason for every headache. If there is no reason, the head will not hurt. There are many causes of headaches, so different headaches cannot be treated in the same way. Conversely, the same treatment cannot cure all headaches. If it could, it would only be a superficial method or a form of anesthesia, not a fundamental solution.</p>

<h3 id="e190">A Watershed in Creative Methods <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiying</p>
<p>Luigi Pirandello recently told reporters in New York that his creations originated in his mind. This statement actually contains a very important question: Does art originate solely from the "mind" in isolation, or is it merely processed by the mind?</p>
<p>Artistic creation undoubtedly requires imagination, even "fantasy." If there were no activity in the writer's "mind," would art even exist in the world? However, the crux of the matter lies precisely here. Does our mind automatically create things out of thin air, or is it merely an advanced material structure that produces imaginations reflecting or related to these real things due to the influence and stimulation of real things?</p>
<p>Modern philosophy has provided us with a clear answer to this question. The human mind, human thought, is stimulated by its real environment, reflecting and expressing it.</p>
<p>So, are Pirandello's words wrong? Is Pirandello's art a reflection of reality?</p>
<p>In fact, Pirandello's words, as an indication of his artistic creation method, are not entirely wrong. And his art is not a reflection of reality; this does not contradict our explanation above.</p>
<p>Originally, there are two main different tendencies in artistic creation methods: one is realistic, and the other is idealistic. This is like a "watershed" in the torrent of philosophical history, dividing into materialism and idealism. However, in reality, realism and materialism, idealism and idealism, although they maintain close relationships, are not entirely the same.</p>
<p>Idealistic writers advocate replacing the objective with the subjective. They believe that all subjectivity accurately reflects reality. Therefore, writers must be as bold as possible in expressing their subjectivity in order to be faithful to reality. Everything expressed by subjectivity is "real." Subjectivity creates everything.</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde said in "The Decay of Lying": "Art never expresses anything but itself. It has an independent life, just as Thought has, and develops purely on its own lines. It is not mimetic, but creative. Nature is often largely disappointing. In fact, Nature is usually disappointing. It is only in Art that we can see the natural course of things. It is in Art that we get what we desire. Morever, Nature is our creation. It is in our brain that it quickens to life. Things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the Arts that have influenced us. To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing. One does not see anything until one sees its beauty."</p>
<p>These words are all "substantial," so I have copied a large section. It seems that we do not need to spend more space here on these opinions. We simply have one question here: According to this, what does the artist "depend on" to exist? If Wilde himself can completely prove that he was not born from a mother's womb but "depended" on something to survive, then we might believe his words.</p>
<p>Here we see a tendency of idealism: to make everything in reality "depend on" one's own subjectivity, "depend on" one's own art. In this sense, Pirandello's statement that his creation originated in his mind is not incorrect. Because Pirandello is also such an idealistic writer, and we say that their art does not reflect reality is not wrong either, because they are not expressing reality but "subjectivity." Their art cannot create vivid images of reality but is only a "conceptual game," a "verbal magic."</p>
<p>The so-called "subjectivity" is created by the real living environment. But if we therefore say that being faithful to "subjectivity" is faithfully expressing the complex living environment, this is undoubtedly an overly arbitrary oversight. It is precisely because subjectivity is created by the conditions of social life that, under the conditions of contradictory and divided social life, there is a "subjectivity" that represents the realistic elements of uniting these contradictory and divided social relations, enabling them to reach a higher development; and there is also a "subjectivity" that represents some decadent elements of reality, which is the opposite. The former "subjectivity" does not sing loudly of absolute independence; it often clings to the developing elements of reality because its creative method is realism. The latter "subjectivity," although also an expression of the decadent elements of reality, does not dare to truthfully express its decadent reality, let alone express the developing reality; otherwise, it would have ceased to exist long ago. This kind of "subjectivity," as a phenomenon of decadent real elements, hides in its own narrow "subjectivity," creating things that distort reality.</p>
<p>These two different subjectivities are the watershed in artistic creation methods. They both come from reality, but one will express reality, and the other will distort reality. People like Wilde and Pirandello, who constantly uphold subjectivity, end up killing subjectivity instead because they treat subjectivity as a symbol to defend sins, as a kind of empty waste, and not as a practical, active force, a force that coincides with the development of reality and supports reality.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Dusk in Huaibin <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>When teaching in Huaiyuan, I felt a bit tired after finishing a day of classes. It was impossible to find a place to dispel the gloom in the city. After dinner, I often went to the banks of the Huai River with Er and Hong.</p>
<p>It was dusk, after the setting sun.</p>
<p>The light footsteps of the three of us, rustling, went along the stone-chipped road paved with green shade. While talking and walking, the cool evening breeze flowed from the wheat fields on both sides to the body, taking away the tiredness of the day. Hong often hummed a song; or made a weird cry "Ooh—", listening to the echoes from the surrounding mountains colliding back, also echoing "Ooh—".</p>
<p>A rushing, long stream lay horizontally in front of us. The faint moonlight reflected the silvery waves on the water. I loved listening to the "surging gurgling" sound of the water, a great and peaceful natural music, which struck the vast love in my soul, giving me a vast and open state of mind.</p>
<p>Together with Ji and Hong, we sat down on the stone steps of the wharf built by the foreign pastor on the bank.</p>
<p>At our feet, the rushing water hit the waves, rushing down to the lower reaches. Looking at the towering mountains on both sides from afar, the mountains stood upright with a solemn appearance. The moon, embracing the clouds, sprinkled a silvery light from the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>In this realm, I breathed out refreshingly, recalling two lines of poetry from the corner of my heart.</p>
<p>——Mountains follow the flat wilderness, the river enters the vast wasteland.</p>
<p>Draped in silvery moonlight, taking advantage of the cool breeze rising on the river, we walked down the stone steps, along the shallows of the Huai River. The rushing water rolled and ran at my feet, and the rising waves splashed onto the back of my feet. Dimly on the water, a few red lights shone from afar, a night shift transport ship dragging seven or eight large boats broke through the waves and rushed over. As the boat passed, the water waves struck up thousands of golden snakes; listen to the long whistle echoing from the mountain wall.</p>
<p>I love the dusk in Huaibin, unfolding a magnificent night view.</p>
<h3 id="e193">On "Tangerines" <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>"Traveling across sand and water to the mountain corner,</p>
<p>Thorned branches encircling the house.</p>
<p>Abundant with patterned, round fruits ripening,</p>
<p>In this, the finest flavor comes from heaven."</p>
<p>This is a small poem I wrote ten years ago, published in a small literary magazine called "Odds and Ends" edited by Luo Hezhi and published in Changsha. At that time, I was teaching at the first Normal School of Hunan Province and the Normal School of Changsha County. Hei Zhi asked me where I moved to, so I wrote this little poem to him. Hei Zhi smiled and said to me: "Your poem is not good, but the place where you live is good." I also smiled and said to him: "The reason I moved to the foot of Yuelu Mountain, traveling across continents and waters, is precisely because there are tangerine trees, evergreen all year round, surrounding the house. I can eat the red tangerines of Yuelu from late autumn to early spring!"</p>
<p>Leaving Changsha from the South Gate, crossing the river, and passing through Shuiluzhou, you arrive at the foot of Yuelu Mountain. The area near the river and against the mountain is all tangerine orchards. Shuiluzhou was called Tangerine Isle in ancient times, precisely because it was named for growing tangerines. Du Fu's poem "Two Temples on Yuelu Mountain, Daolin" has a line that says, "The fields and land on Qiaozhou are still fertile," because the fields and land on the isle are fertile, the tangerines produced are large and sweet. According to local gazettes, "Tanzhou Tangerine Isle is south of the county, facing Nan Jin. It often looks as if it is below. When the summer waters embrace the mountains, all the isles and sandbars are submerged, the isle alone remains." Ancient people thought that Tangerine Isle could rise and fall with the water level, which is inevitably close to mythology.</p>
<p>We know that tangerine trees are a specialty of Hunan, famous since ancient times. Qu Yuan's "Ode to the Tangerine" says: "Heaven and Earth, auspicious trees, tangerines come to serve. Receiving fate, not migrating, born in the south." It seems to say that Heaven and Earth specially ordered tangerine trees to be born in this southern country. Of course, the southern country mentioned by Qu Yuan does not necessarily refer to Hunan, but it is a fact that Hunan was a part of the State of Chu at that time and happened to be in the south of the State of Chu. The "Ode to the Tangerine" also says: "Deep and difficult to move, protect even more. The green leaves are luxuriant, delightful. Overlapping branches are thorny, round and clustered. Green and yellow mixed, patterns dazzling. Pure color inside is white, suitable for the Way. Flourishing and ornate, beautiful and not ugly." Qu Yuan personified the tangerine tree, saying that it has three virtues: one is firm ambition, the second is dazzling patterns, and the third is an essence not ugly. In fact, Qu Yuan himself wanted to use the tangerine tree to symbolize his own personality, so his "Ode to the Tangerine" is nothing more than self-praise.</p>
<p>Tangerine trees belong to the Rutaceae family in botany, evergreen shrubs, the trunk is about ten feet high, the branches are very dense and thorny, the leaves are long oval, the leaf tips are sharp, and the petioles have winged small pieces. In summer, five-petaled white flowers bloom, slightly similar to jasmine, with a fragrant aroma. After frost falls, the oblate fruits ripen, the peel turns red, and then they can be eaten. Wang Youjun's letter said: "Offering three hundred tangerines, before the frost falls, not many can be obtained." Originally, if the tangerines do not see the frost, and the peel does not turn red, then they are not good to eat. Wei Yingwu has a line in his poem that says: "After writing, I want to inscribe three hundred fruits, Dongting must wait for the frost to fill the forest." He is using the allusion from Wang Youjun's letter. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e194">Middle Age <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Lately, I've been constantly touched by the feelings of autumn, which, in turn, has brought on the oppressive feeling of middle age. Those who habitually compare the four seasons to the stages of human life say that middle age is close to summer. However, it seems difficult for us to see a middle age that resembles summer. Most people, upon reaching middle age, already have the air of old age, and their lives continue in the same pattern forever after. To put it nicely, this is probably because reason has grown significantly and knowledge has become established. To put it badly, even if we set aside the unfortunate issues of declining vitality and career anxieties, and even if we acknowledge that they can indeed find a proper way to live and establish themselves in middle age, it's not much different from the life of a superstitious person.</p>
<p>We often hear people talk about the sentiments of middle age, but these so-called sentiments are probably just feelings of helplessness, or recollections of past sentiments. The genuine sadness of youth is no longer there. From various theories, we know that the elimination of sadness is both inevitable and necessary, but the inevitable process and necessary conditions here may not have a consistent explanation. People's desire for spring to warm up sooner and autumn to cool down sooner often contradicts the actual seasonal changes. Who knows if our sentimentality disappears too quickly?</p>
<p>Does everyone go through a period of sentimental age? It seems impossible to know. And if the era is one in which one should not be sentimental, then personal sentimentality is insignificant. But if this era is full of sentimental people who forcibly endure the oppression of the era and try to conceal their sentimentality, wouldn't it form a great hypocrisy? Although unnatural progress may not be a form of progress and may not gradually turn into nature, one must also worry about the breaking of an empty shell.</p>
<p>I don't want to think about it anymore. Let's narrow it down to the individual. The states of "establishment" and "unconfusion" certainly seem like perfection. However, since there is a way to complete it in a model-like way, the value of the achievement is extremely uneven. The weaknesses inherent in middle age may not be immediately apparent, but once one approaches old age, one either falls into stubbornness or succumbs to decline. These two characteristics, which are regarded as features of aging, are actually deeply buried in middle age. This situation is too common, making us think that it should naturally be so, and never think that it can be noticed earlier in middle age. Although the so-called sentiments of middle age are often the approaching of summer's decline and old age, at the same time, one often believes that one is in a very confident middle age. As long as one firmly grasps oneself in middle age, old age will not come immediately. Isn't this precisely stubbornness and confusion?</p>
<p>People's feelings about their own middle age are not as clear as their feelings about autumn. After all, autumn belongs to the outside world. Of course, there should be many differences between the outside world and the inner world, but if we think that life is a longer period, it is not okay to extend it further. We might as well believe that the seasons are a more eternal phenomenon. If we can understand the complexity of autumn, perhaps our middle age will not be so monotonous.</p>
<p>But alas, it is already the autumn of middle age. I don't feel the desolation of autumn in my mood, nor do I appreciate the seriousness of autumn. I really fear that an earlier old age has already arrived.</p>

<p>— Green Leaves</p>
<p>Outside the door, the flower market is like a painting; a scene of revelry by licentious foreign gentlemen and socialites, teasing my melancholy mood. I sit in the coffee shop in agony. In the exchange of wine, fragrance, meat, and lust, there is the dance of noble mummies. Filled with inexplicable sorrow, I gaze at the rapid chaos of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Seesaw (6) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Baichen</p>
<p>The little monk also beat the drum: "That board is fun!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Mom gave them a "Ptooey!" and dragged them away: "That will break your legs!"</p>
<p>The little rascal broke free, twisting his body and humming: "......!" The little monk ran back to the door to watch, grabbing the railing and refusing to let go. Inside, the board seesawed up and down, climbed up and slid down on the high frame, and people became one, laughing as one. No one paid attention to them.</p>
<p>"The one at Guihua Nunnery is more fun! Let's go! That one has --"</p>
<p>Mom forcefully pulled the little monk away, coaxing them with something or other. The children softened their hearts, looked back a few times, and had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>Behind them, there was a burst of shouting, a burst of laughter, and the little monk only felt his body relax, a sudden sinking feeling, and a "thump" sound behind him, and the little monk's legs couldn't help but stiffen.</p>
<p>Turn left, turn right, the sound was no longer heard, the white powder wall was also gone, and the children followed behind Mom.</p>
<p>There were more people on the road, and the women carried incense, small lanterns, and yellow cloth bags, talking and walking in groups of three and five. Turn another bend, and you see a screen wall painted with yellow powder. Opposite the screen wall is a temple. People are squeezed in front of the temple like ants. The noisy sounds mixed into a sea, and you can't make heads or tails of it. Only the small candy gong clangs, and the bamboo clapper bangs alone, above this sea of sounds. They could hear that the "duo er duo" bamboo clapper was Dad's. Inside the temple gate, it was pitch black, and only a burst of thick green smoke could be seen billowing outwards, slowly dissipating on the roof.</p>
<p>Gradually walking into the crowd, Mom found Dad's carrying pole. Dad was busy. While ladling porridge, while collecting money, while washing bowls, he also took time to knock the bamboo clapper twice. The carrying pole was surrounded by people, and Dad seemed unable to take care of it. Mom wanted to help, but Dad pushed her away: "Go burn your incense!"</p>
<p>The three squeezed into the temple gate, and a burst of smoke rushed towards them, blurring their eyes with tears. In the courtyard, there was a large money pot, burning dozens or hundreds of small lanterns, and the flames were still two feet high. It was so hot that people were sweating. In a small pot, whole strands of incense were burning, and candles were also thrown in to burn. The smoke was like rainbows, and you couldn't see people across the way: the smell of candle wax was suffocating. The women chanted: "Amitabha," and the sound of copper coins thrown into the money cage rang out with a clang.</p>
<p>Mom kowtowed, telling ghost stories. She pressed the children to kowtow as well. The little monk ran back to the courtyard first. He called out: "Let's go! It's not fun." Mom had no choice but to lead the little rascal out as well. But she was confused and didn't even take a look at the Bodhisattva! Turning back, she was blinded by the smoke again, so she had to pray two more ghost words before walking out of the temple gate.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Three of Diplomatic Means <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Shun</p>
<p>Large-scale maneuvers and large-scale exchanges are a kind of armed demonstration and have nothing to do with diplomatic means. Diplomatic means are used to resolve international disputes with non-military means, so they are called diplomatic means. However, diplomatic means are not used with military force as a backing. No matter how flexible your means are, they will definitely not have any effect. This is an iron rule taught by history and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>When the situation in the Far East was urgent, the United States also had a large-scale maneuver in the Pacific, but it did not reverse the already bad situation. Therefore, simply conducting large-scale maneuvers to intimidate cannot have any diplomatic impact. Now that the Italian-Ethiopian War is about to break out, although the United Kingdom, France, and other countries have tried their best to mediate, there is no hope for a peaceful resolution. Furthermore, after the oil concession in Ethiopia was granted to the Fil Oil Exploration Company, it further aroused the anger of the Italians. Although the US government has expressed its intention to give up, the Ethiopian government and the company still do not want to give up. Therefore, once the Italian-Ethiopian War suddenly breaks out, it is still unknown whether it will not lead to an expansion of the situation. Therefore, when "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind fills the building" today, the European powers cannot help but have a frowning expression, as if a great disaster is about to come. It can be seen that diplomatic means are not enough to open the difficult situation of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute.</p>
<p>According to a Rome dispatch on the 25th of last month, the Italian military's large-scale maneuvers began. The army was about 500,000 people, and the hypothetical enemy invaded from the German-Austrian border to test the combat strength of the mechanized army. According to a London dispatch on the 30th, the United Kingdom launched diplomatic and military forces to cope with serious events in the future. The Mediterranean fleet was very busy with deployments. According to a London dispatch on the 2nd, Italy's large-scale maneuvers in the northern territory have now ended, and the United Kingdom, France, and Germany will follow up with large-scale maneuvers to show their military strength. Large-scale maneuvers by the French army have already begun on the border between Qu and Conde, and at the same time, Germany has begun to hold the first public performance of mock war exercises since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles. As for the British army, it will go to Salisbury Plain to create the thirteenth mock war exercise. Originally, this kind of mock war exercise cannot be regarded as the prelude to the Second World War, but at least it can be regarded as a way to seek the smooth progress of diplomacy.</p>
<p>According to a Geneva dispatch on the 5th, the League of Nations Administrative Council, which had the last hope for peace, held a meeting, and the future showed ominous signs. The Ethiopian representative spoke eloquently, and the Italian representative left the meeting in anger. Although British and French diplomats used all kinds of diplomatic methods to eliminate the war between Italy and Ethiopia, they have come to an end. At this point, it is feared that there will be no possibility of using diplomatic means to resolve the difficult situation in the future. Only by using strength to resolve the current difficulties, the outcome of the war, and who will win, can only be proved by the results of the war in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Mountain Village Rainy Night <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>Returning from the city, it was evening. We planned to rush back to the mountain before dark, but we hadn't even gone halfway when it started to rain. We urged the mule driver to run fast, and we reached a town seven or eight miles away from the mountain, and our clothes were soaked. We had dinner at a small shop, dried our clothes by the fire, rested our feet, hoping that the rain would stop so we could rush back to the mountain, but the rain seemed to be getting heavier and heavier, as if it was deliberately making things difficult for us.</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and the wind was blowing the rain against the window of the small shop. The small reed curtain rolled up and fell down again regardless. The window paper was already soaked through. The small shop was pitifully small, and there were no larger shops in the small town for the three of us to spend the night. Just watching the rain fall was definitely not a solution, so we bought an umbrella—the only one in a salt shop—and braved the rain to rush back to the mountain along the mountain road seven or eight miles away. It had been too dry for too long, so the rain was particularly heavy. The rainwater on the mountain poured down like small rivers, and we waded in the rivers and rushed along the mountain road.</p>
<p>The darkness was terrifying, and the thunder seemed to be ringing right under our feet, and the lightning was flashing right above us. In the flash of lightning, we saw the dense rain sweeping the mountains and trees with the mountain wind. The small paper umbrella could hardly support it anymore. Against the mountain wind, it was hard to barely block some of the coarse raindrops, and its effectiveness was naturally pitifully small! We were soaked to the skin, and our soaked leather shoes were squeaking. Behind us, our spines and clothes were stuck together. Except for one heart, the whole body was cold.</p>
<p>I was very scared, and I thought of the story of the mountain wolf. At this time, one person's strength is really no match for a wild beast. There wasn't a single sign on the mountain to prove that people lived there! (If there was a lamp in the mountain rain, even if it was a strange will-o'-the-wisp, we would feel at ease!) We were no different from a team of explorers, desperately seeking a place to stay on a stormy night, but there was none. It was a desolate mountain, an isolated island; the momentum of the wind and rain placed us on the black giant waves in the ocean. I had this experience: the dark, gloomy waves rose and fell, like a group of ferocious giant beasts about to devour people; who knew what terrible things were under the waves! I understand the primitive people's worship of nature. I blessed myself and quickened my pace. Everything was sacrificed as expected. The umbrella unfortunately touched a tree branch, broke a big hole, and broke a few ribs, and could no longer hold up, so we simply threw it away, let the rain pour on us, and walked hand in hand.</p>
<p>The big mountain stream that we were most afraid of was in front of us. Our residence was to be reached by crossing this stream. In normal times, the mountain stream was a road, and donkeys and camels could pass through it. But when it rained, the situation was different. This was the most dangerous place: boom! boom! boom! The mountain water poured straight down, carrying branches, weeds, and rocks. We saw the speed of the water flow in a flash of lightning—how terrible! We thought of the safety of our lives. If we were unlucky enough to encounter a large mountain rock rolling down with the current, we would be finished! "A big rock, climb slowly!" I issued a warning as the vanguard. In order to climb, hands and eyes lost contact, and what replaced contact was sound; what a tense sound it was, a cry for survival!</p>
<p>After climbing over the large mountain rock and gasping for breath, we found ourselves in the rushing rapids. What we were treading on under our feet was no longer the familiar road, but an unexpected unevenness: a pit, a small pool, a rock; some of the rocks were still covered with slippery moss, which must have rolled down from the high shady place of the mountain stream. "Hold your hands tight, hold your hands tight," said the smallest male, boom! boom! boom! It was thunder, and the aftersound was still vibrating in the mountainside. The male fell into the turbulent flow! Above his head was a huge thunderbolt, and under his feet he had stepped into a terrible hole—a deep pit, he fell! We picked him up, and I touched his chest: thud, thud! thud! We couldn't help but laugh. "It's almost there, we'll be there after we cross the stream," I comforted him.</p>
<p>Thank goodness! When we looked back at the terrible mountain stream, we couldn't help but shout! How terrible it was: a lightning bolt, a thunderbolt, a torrent of rushing water!</p>
<p>"Hum! A useless umbrella!" After climbing up the mountain stream, we laughed! Don't get sick, I bless us. I asked about the things we brought back from the city, and everyone shook their empty hands and laughed!</p>
<p>When we went to bed, we could still hear the roaring of the mountain stream!</p>

<p>— Zaishi</p>
<p>He, —a poverty-stricken farmer— struggled to maintain his poor life every year with a few acres of rented fields. The environment bestowed on him every year was like this. There was simply no time for him to be slightly more prosperous. He was unable to improve his life, it could also be said that he did not think of improving his life, and it could even be said that he did not want to improve his life. He only held the mentality that this was a responsibility given to him by heaven, and he was indeed a faithful believer in fatalism; therefore, although he worked hard all day and all year round, he did not have any resentment, no thoughts, and no envy for the beautified lives of the rich. In short: China's unique national character—patience—completely occupied his entire mind.</p>
<p>The food for his wife and children, the losses from fertilizer, etc., the heavy burden of this life, pressed on him, often making him feel panicked. Although there were plenty of longevity granaries in the towns, he was not qualified to step into the door of these longevity granaries. Therefore, borrowing at high interest rates was his only means of salvation. When it came time for the harvest, paying rent and repaying debts was just enough to dispose of all his harvest. He spent a year of labor, the help of his wife and children, and the price he got was just empty hands. So he returned to the life of borrowing to make ends meet. Year after year, he did not feel pain because of the heavy burden of life, and even seemed very satisfied. Patience was his will; fate was his self-comfort.</p>
<p>Even more admirable: he was not willing to relax his responsibility even slightly, that is to say: he was not willing to give up his profit even slightly. He saw that there was a vacant lot next to his house, which could be used to plant small crops, so after some hard work, he implemented his plan and planted a lot of watermelons. In his mind, he only hoped to get some extra income to make up for his losses. This year made him particularly excited. The watermelons on this vacant lot were so abundant. He was full of joy, loaded two large loads of watermelons, and on that morning, carrying this heavy burden of 200 pounds, he rushed to the town ten miles away from his home to sell them. His mood was pleasant. He really wanted to satisfy his hope. At that time, the sun was majestically shining on the earth, and he ran for many miles under this scorching sun, gradually feeling tired. However, he did not take fatigue as pain, but rather as joy. Because he understood that the hotter the weather, the higher the value of watermelons. Unfortunately, just as he was about to reach the town, God suddenly bestowed a heavy rain, soaking his body and mind, drenching him like a drowned chicken. Although he was a very healthy farmer, he could not withstand such destruction, so the source of the disease was sown like this. When he arrived in the town, he saw that there were so many companions who had the same encounter and were selling their watermelons at the same low price. The value of the watermelons was so cheap. He suffered this cold rain-like blow, and his heart was so anxious that a mouthful of fresh blood immediately appeared before his eyes. At this time, his overly tired body could no longer support him. So he barely sold the watermelons, dragged his heavy steps, and walked home. It was pitiful that his illness at that time was already so serious.</p>
<p>Now his son has inherited his father's legacy and will continue to live their arduous life endlessly.</p>
<h3 id="e200">School Enrollment <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Erlang</p>
<p>It's funny to say, this summer I went to a place to "escape the heat." It was a school, and no one lived there during summer vacation. My friend, who was a school cadre, strongly invited me to live there, saying, "Living in a pavilion room in such hot weather, move to my place, it's cool and quiet." (And "you don't have to pay rent," he didn't say, but I knew.) So, I "escaped the heat" there. Now that school has started, and I have "escaped the heat" enough, I still returned to the pavilion room.</p>
<p>A few days before I was about to leave, their school was busy with student enrollment registration, and a tragicomedy that was both funny and sad happened.</p>
<p>When a group of innocent and lovely elementary school students was surrounding the director of the elementary school department, talking about their lives during the summer vacation, suddenly an old woman flashed in at the door, holding a seven- or eight-year-old child, and cried out, "Sir," tears streaming down her dark eyes, "my little one wants to go to school." The teacher looked surprised, and the children were also surprised. Why cry when you want to go to school? Before the teacher could speak, the old woman said, crying, "His father is dead"—died last month—"the work I do in a day is only enough to eat, where does the little one get the money to go to school? I wanted to ask him to apprentice at the blacksmith shop, but he's too young, only seven years old, only seven years old. It's better to let him go to school. If he recognizes a few words in the future, when he's ten, study for two years, and ask him to go to a foreign goods store as a student, he'll recognize words and have a chance to stand out. Let him go to school, but there's no money at home... Sir, his father died last month, and there's really no money at home, please do a good deed, sir."... She said a lot, and I, who was listening nearby, didn't know what she meant, and the children didn't understand it even more, but saw her tears and snot just flowing, and she used her sleeves to wipe her nose while talking. The teacher understood, and asked, "You mean, you want it for free? You don't have to pay money, right?" She didn't understand the phrase "for free," but "you don't have to pay money" was it. She said, "Please do a good deed, sir, there's really no money at home. His father..." And she went on and on. The teacher frowned and smiled, and after a long time, he said, "The school also doesn't have much funding, and there's no precedent for free... However, your child's grades were good last semester, he's willing to study hard, and he follows the rules. If you don't have money at home, then... then... I'll discuss it with the principal." She thought the teacher had agreed, and before the teacher could prevent it, she knelt on the ground and kowtowed, saying, "You're doing a good deed, sir,... the little one will have a chance to stand out in the future, all thanks to your kindness." The teacher immediately stood up from the chair, bent down to ask her to get up, "I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it,... I still have to discuss it with the principal," but she only cared about talking and kowtowing, and didn't hear what the teacher said. After kowtowing many times, she stood up on her own, and said with tears, "I still have to work, the little one will come to school today," and ordered the little one she was holding, "Thank you, sir!" meaning that he should also kowtow, but the little one only bowed to the teacher at school, and had never kowtowed before. He looked at his mother, looked at the teacher, and then bowed deeply to the teacher three times. "Kowtow, Xiaoliuzi!" Mom was not satisfied with the three bows, and the little one argued, "The teacher doesn't let people kowtow, he likes bowing." The teacher said, "Bowing is good," and Mom didn't insist, just saying, "Sir, the little one will come to school today, I still have to work," led the little one to the teacher, made a deep bow, and left.</p>
<p>That teacher turned around and said to me, "This semester, there's more than just her requesting for free. The school's economy hasn't increased, and education is also in a slump now." Because I was just moved by the old woman's actions, I said sympathetically, "For someone like her who has upward mobility, and her son is willing to study hard and has good grades, he should be given it for free." The teacher replied, "Children's education should be free in the first place. But public schools still have to charge fees, and private schools, what can be done! Many students are not going to school this semester, because their families don't have money. Alas, it's Children's Year, but fewer children are going to school!" The teacher also became sentimental.</p>

<p>— From Long</p>
<p>After dinner, Brother Zhixiang stepped out of the shop and went to the back of the warehouse to wash his oily body. He immediately felt relaxed and cool, as if he had drunk a glass of water. All the gloominess of the day in 　　州</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>had faded away. So, he moved a stool and sat next to the "glass" door, staring blankly, gazing slowly at the calm, waveless, emerald green sea in the distance.</p>
<p>Arriving in this foreign land for the first time, everything that caught his eye felt new and strange: people were of all shapes and sizes, like at a race exhibition. Some were as black as burnt charcoal, some as white as the rice flour used for making kueh during festivals. When they spoke, it was gibberish, not a single word was understandable, like little rats on the roof beams at home conspiring to steal vegetables, how interesting. Even the water in the harbor was more turquoise and clearer than the water in the ponds back home. The sky seemed a little higher, and clearer too. Moreover, the floating clouds drifting across the blue sky seemed particularly light and agile. "The scenery and landscapes of this foreign land are much more beautiful than back home!" Brother Zhixiang thought to himself. However, when he thought that he had been in this foreign land for a whole month and hadn't found a job, and that he had been rejected at job interviews with people shaking their heads and sighing, "The market is sluggish, it's hard to say if we can even get through the end of the year," he had no choice but to come to his distant uncle's shop to "bum around and eat." During the day, he helped out with chores in the shop.</p>
<p>Gusts of light evening breeze swept across the sky, stirring up layers of brocade-like ripples on the turquoise sea. The coconut groves standing by the harbor whispered softly, like the murmurings of lovers.</p>
<p>"Zhixiang, what's up? Sitting here like a fool... Little guy, homesick again!" Old Du, who was "shipping goods" at the shop, walked over, patted him on the shoulder, and said in a hoarse voice, "Don't be silly, let's go out for a stroll, come with me and chase after some flirtatious whores."</p>
<p>Old Du was a thoroughbred foreigner. According to him, he hadn't been back to Tangshan for over a decade. During the day, whenever he had free time, betel leaves were always in his mouth, chewing until his teeth had turned black. In addition, he always liked to wear a pair of Nanyang black silk pants.</p>
<p>They shuffled along in their slippers along the coast towards Beach Road, passing through many unnamed streets and alleys, in a strange hurry, as if they had something urgent to do, not at all like they were out for a stroll. When they reached the front of the Small Hill "Pasar" (market), Brother Zhixiang was already panting like an overworked ox, his shirt soaked with sweat, as if he had been caught in a rainstorm halfway there.</p>
<p>"Where are we going anyway... Old Du, why are you always rushing like this?" He couldn't help but ask, his voice lacking energy because he was too tired from running.</p>
<p>"Why the rush? Little guy, just follow me, I guarantee you'll have a good time!"</p>
<p>So, they continued to shuffle forward.</p>
<p>The night gradually lowered, swallowing the remaining sunset. The streetlights standing by the roadside cast a dim, weak glow, like the tired eyes of a sleepless person. Entering a dark, narrow alley, Old Du turned his head and whispered in Brother Zhixiang's ear with a grin, "We're here!"</p>
<p>This was really unexpected for Brother Zhixiang. This dark alley was like a "Pasar", with all sorts of races. Especially the women whose faces were rouged like monkey butts were dressed quite flirtatiously, leaning in twos and threes next to the doorframes, enticing passersby with silvery laughter.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhixiang, look at this whore, she's not bad looking, especially the dimples on her face!"</p>
<p>"Eh!..." Brother Zhixiang frowned as if recalling something, his head lowered.</p>
<p>The whore didn't dare to raise her head either, seeming a little embarrassed at heart.</p>
<p>"Haha, I thought you were an honest guy, but you've only been here for less than a month and you've already got a 'lover' (partner)!" Old Du also felt a little strange, and teased.</p>
<p>"What are you saying? This prostitute looks familiar. I remember she came on the same ship as me. She said she was coming here to find her husband, how is she a prostitute now?"</p>
<p>"In this kind of market, even a strong man is constantly worrying about not having a bowl of rice to eat. Maybe her husband has lost his job and wandered off somewhere else?... If she doesn't become a prostitute, what else can she do?"</p>
<p>This sorrow of life hurt their hearts, covering them with a layer of gray-black clouds, and they had no mood to stroll around any further.</p>

<p>Four Sister Flowers</p>
<p>I love the fragrance of plum blossoms, a sprig adorns my glory; this brave leader does not compete with peaches and plums for beauty. (Plum sings)</p>
<p>I love the fragrance of apricot blossoms, a lifetime enjoyed in offering; this beautiful fairy is used to comparing her clothes with purple and crimson. (Apricot sings)</p>
<p>I love the fragrance of orchids, my silk robe can withstand the coolness of dewdrops; this quiet girl is afraid of comparing her length with ordinary flowers. (Orchid sings)</p>
<p>I love the fragrance of lotus flowers, rising from the mud, naturally fragrant; this noble gentleman wishes to make the clear waves his home. (Lotus sings)</p>
<p>Homeland, homeland! The eyes are filled with the wounds of wind and rain! Wounds! Wounds! Yesterday's fresh flowers are today's funerals! (Two flowers sing together) We four sisters do not learn from the ways of flowers. We endure frost and snow, we resist the waves; we rely on our hands to move straight up the battle line of life, not afraid of violent rain and raging wind, we want to let our free flowers bloom. (Four flowers sing together)</p>
<p>Homeland! Homeland! Cannot escape the bleakness of wind and rain! Bleakness! Bleakness! Today the flowers bloom, tomorrow they are buried! (Two flowers sing together) We four sisters do not learn from the ways of flowers. We are not fragrant in spring, we do not wither in autumn; we are evergreen in all seasons, never sad for wind and rain, no matter the vicissitudes of human life, as long as we sisters never forget each other. (Four flowers sing together)</p>

<p>Green bamboo wind reflects the jade window. Qin Lou prostitutes sigh sadly. Hate parents for short-sightedness. Greed for flower money forgets nature. Biological daughter. Sold to Pingkang. Sending off the old and welcoming the new with smiling faces. Still have no fixed husband. Sending Zhang Lang and then Li Lang. Going to bed with a husband participates in heaven and earth. But have never worshiped the hall. Two jade arms pillow a thousand people. A little cherry is tasted by ten thousand guests. Last night's wonderful fate with a suave son. Tonight, I met a stupid, vulgar man. There is also a class of stupid Hans. Often garlic and scallions drink sorghum liquor. There is also a class of sad things. I can't avoid taking tonics. Where do children come from to call mother? Thinking back when Mo Suhui met Zishu Ye. Li Shishi was lucky to accompany the Emperor. It is difficult to learn from a flower queen in West Lake. There is no second oil seller. Qin Xiaoguan may not turn Yang back. It is better to repair a little red thread. Sincerely pray and worship Cihang. It is better than a flower queen to be a prostitute.</p>
