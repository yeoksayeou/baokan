<p>時評</p>
<h3>意軍侵阿的第一旬</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>意軍侵阿淤本月三日發動。到今日已滿十整天了。這個戰爭的不可避免。早在觀察者的意料之中。所以它的正式爆發。並沒有引起國祭間怎樣的震驚。然而對於這次戰爭的牽涉範圍及最後結果。已使全世界發生非常的關切。旬日以來。東非的戰况還沒有顯著的發展。在地中海。在國聯。雖然空氣嚴重。尙未見巨大變化的朕兆。但各方面的縣惴不安。則在繼續增加之中。現在我們姑以旬日來的各種情况。一觀這次戰爭的影響及趨向。</p>
<p>這次戰爭所發生的最大影響。是國聯所受的打擊。國聯以全體大會的力量。不能消解意阿兩國間的爭端。如今意軍已發動侵阿。國聯雖根據盟約。認意國爲侵略者。但事實上恐又無力貫徹其應有的制裁。最近國聯的活動都。是英國的力量所促成的。實際上國聯所能做的只是形式上的事情。它的决議能否生效。須看列强的軍事外交力量的運用而定。在對於意國的制裁上。英國須取得法國的切實支持。而意國外交在中歐活動的結果。使奧匈瑞士拒絕執行共同的制裁。國聯的决議也就成爲無用的具文了。今後國聯在國際調解上的力量。將益見微弱。是可以預料的。</p>
<p>英國所受到這次戰爭的影響。也是不小的。地中海紅海航路爲英帝國的生命棧。在德奧同盟國的勢力消解以後。現在又出現一個新的成脅老了。意國對英態度的强硬。使英國發覺其海空軍力在無形中的落後。今後英帝國的軍力在世界的分配。大槪將有一個重要的變動。英本國與地中海一帶當然是主力之所在。在遠東的力量將較前减弱。這是一九一四年大戰前的布置方式。所不同者。當時注重於北海。目的爲對德。今後將注重於地中海。目的爲對意。但前後可有一共通點。就是在遠東海洋上對日的妥協。據前日路透社的倫敦電。前駐日英大使林特萊於演說中表示。英國對日瞧妥協。而對中國不能「加以鼓。勵」這種露骨的言論在現在的發見。　可注意的。同時英國這種政策對於世界。特別是對於東方的影響。也是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>這次的戰爭將發展到如何地步。現在很難預說。意國一而發動侵略。一面並不與國聯决絕。其目的似乎準備在相當的軍事勝利之後。再回頭到外交的談判。英國現在一面推動國聯的制裁。對意施用間接的壓力。一面則沉靜旁觀。避免興意國的正式衝突。大槪意軍的侵略若無順利的進展。同時法國能以全力支持英國的立塲。則英方的態度就可强硬起來。進行更直接的干涉。照旬日來的戰况。意軍並不十分得手。這塲戰爭若要拖延到多少時日。却會引起其他的重要的變化的。意國不易負担長久的軍事支出。英國不能忍受對於它的主要航路的長久威脅。同時歐洲的反現狀與維持同狀兩大集團。漸見旗幟分明。東非的火藥綫一且傳導到地中海。則整個歐洲都在爆發範圍之內了。</p>
<p>自然。現在我們不能推想得過遠。就切近的方面看。阿國的抵抗侵略已。顯示了多少的成功。這對於一般弱小民族的鼓勵。是不容忽視的。阿國以國聯會員國的資格。在可能範圍內。對於國聯應表示相當的信賴。但它也知道。爲維持自己的生存。對於侵略者不得不取全力的抵抗。而這種抵抗竟是有效的。那麽旬日來的東非戰爭。已經給世界的弱小民族啟示一條求生的道路了。</p>
<h3>意軍侵阿　向東南境進展　希比利河流域慘遭轟炸　施放毒氣人畜死傷無算　阿軍十萬深溝高壘備戰</h3>

<h3>朱柏廬的八箇字</h3>
<p>— 天成我生</p>
<p>朱柏廬的治家格言，說上一大篇，而歸根結柢，只有兩句是眞正的格言，就是：「守分安命，順時聽天」八個大字。分是分量，譬如天平秤，你自已的砝碼，只能重到一千公分爲止，你略想超過一分，就是過分，决定是載不起的，你用十分的砝碼，去秤九分的東西，自然覺得輕挑，還可加重，但如加上了二分，他又欹重到這方而來，所以在九分九的時候，只能加上一釐已足，雖然一時不能平穩，但是你只要耐心守着一二秒鐘，便可見其分曉，若是心慌意急，手忙脚亂的，忽减忽加，那就永永不得其平了。命猶令也，軍令猶可違，而天命不可抗，人生墮地，爲女爲男，是天命也，墮地而後，父母不忍其死，衣之食之，必令存在世間而爲人，是父母之命也。父母不能衣食我終身，我乃自覔衣食，並以衣食我父母，因而受人使命，不敢抗逆，子之於父，弟之於兄，臣之於君，皆如是也，雖或勿欲，亦只能安心承受，否則於已無益而且有損，旣不能逃出世外，則不如隨遇而安，君子居易以俟命，易，平易也，人若立於至平之地，行其至易之事，不去冒險以圖徼倖，卽可安居樂業，無所用其怨尤。時，卽天時，天有四時，變於兩極，夏至則陰生，冬至則陽生，嚴寒盛暑之來，我旣不能抗逆，則唯順受而已。不順而逆，如逆料其將來如何，自古皆有死，則何用掙扎，舜之父母，亦惟順之而已，然因此得以孝聞，堯授天下於舜，亦惟能順其時而已。天之生我，原爲造物之用，耕田而食，鑿并而飲，耕與鑿之器，莫不由於人造，入能造物，而我不能，我當引以爲恥，然我所賦於天之性，拙而不巧，祇能用其手足之力，以求免於飢寒，於是盡力乎田井之中，以謀飲食之無缺乏，是我所當爲也。至於田禾之有歉歲，井水之有枯時，則惟聽之於天。然而人力可以回天，日出而作，日入而息，盡力於畎畝之中，則百畝之田，未必全荒，九家同井，未必全枯，若竟有之，則隣里相助，以通有無，亦足以資生活。故凡爲人，必當具有仁心，仁卽除我之外，尙有他人，不可不顧，故其字體實爲二人，非若一人之爲大也。二人爲大，亦言不止一人之力，能集二人以上合作時，其能力亦可以造物利人，正與天之能力無少異也。破曉而起，信筆作此，蓋亦乘其平旦之氣，用爲攝心之法，是非工拙，所不計也。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>志前說着，逕直的就向賈多才這邊屋子走了來，爲給賈多才早早一個報告起見，老遠的就叫着賈先生。屋子裏倒是答應着，他道：賈老爺同朋友出去了，是那一位呀。志前聽了這語音，先把那一股子豪氣挫下去了一大半，這是月英的聲音，假使向他報告着，他祖母盼望着他快要死了他立刻會跑了出去的。回頭賣多才回來了，倒說自己另外存有什麼壞心，徒惹一塲是非。因之自己喊出了賈先生之後，倒是停止了脚步，向前不得。月英在屋子裏答應着因問話的人，還沒有過來，就伸着頭向外看了一看。及至看到志前老遠的站定了，心裏却也是一怔。可是他和賈多才住在屋子裏，天天見客，態度已大方了許多？不怎樣的怕男人了，於是鎭定着微笑了一笑道：哦！是程先生，有什么事嗎？志前呑下去了一口氣，裝出笑容來道：是有點兒事，不過賈先生不在家，我的話就……說着，連搔了幾下頭，就笑道，也沒有什么事。賈太太，你請在屋子裏坐一會子，我找一個人來和你有話說。說畢，趕快就向小西天後面跑了去。果然的，那朱家老太太還坐在門框下。胡嫂子看到，首先就向這邊亂指點着道：來了！來了！那老太太戰戰兢兢的，伸了一個手指，向這真指點着，拉了他兒媳婦的手，站了起來道：他……他……來了嗎？（三三八）</p>
<h3>惲鐵樵先生遺墨</h3>
<p>— 顧雨時</p>
<p>先師惲先生，諱鐵樵，續學士也。高文載道，國手活人，桃李從游，不遠千里，先生無不循循然善誘之。雨時辱厠門牆，得以昕夕追隨，歧黃親炙，傳經侍饌，蒙師不以爲不可教而斵成之。凡中醫精髓之形能學，以及治醫所當着限之點，靡不指示眞秘，蓋形能二字，出自內經，此種學問，可謂中醫之絕學，知者殊鮮，並世末學，竟以形能二字，曲解爲形態。師治學有根，見解獨到，發皇古義，探究精微，自非寡學者所能望其項背也。師暮年，尤工書法，沂年以腕病不能作書，所有翰墨，均倩人提筆。當雨時卒業之日，先師尙健筆如飛，過蒙獎許，錫以七字聯一副，不意　瀋猶鮮，道山遽去，摩挲手澤，不知涕泗之何從，坐對遺珍，緬懷遺教，曷敢自秘，謹刊報端，藉供同好，並識哀思云爾。</p>

<p>就太后洗澡時所用的毛巾來講，已可見其奢侈　的一般了！那些毛巾的四周都用杏黃色的絲綫扣着，成爲一圈很齊整的外邊，中間更用同色的絲綫紮繡成一絛極精緻的團龍；鮮明的黃色，凑着雪也似的白地，眞是多么的動人啊！我想就把這幾條浴巾送上那一處的博覽會去陳列，已不失爲一種很精美的工藝品了！</p>
<p>當太后在那矮幾上坐定的時候，這四個宮女已在很忙碌地準備着了；於是太后便自動的把上身的衣服解下，裸了伊的上體。我雖然沒有意思一定要賞　伊的玉體，但旣已在我面前展露了開來，我自亦不免要看一看的；這一看倒使我非常的詫異起來了。因爲太后的年齡我是早就知道的了，依我想來，像這樣一位老太太的身上，自必沒有什么肉彩可看了，所能見到的定然祇有一重乾癟的枯皮。那知道太后的身上絕對不是如此！伊的身段原是非常美妙的，也不太肥，也不太瘦，肉色，出奇的鮮嫩，白得毫無半些疤瘢，看去又是十分的柔滑。像這樣的一個軀體，尋常祗有一般二十歲左右的少女才能有此；不料此刻我却在一位老太太的身上看到，眞不可謂非奇跡了！那時候我不禁就暗暗的想着，如其太后的面部更能化裝得年輕一些，再凑上伊這樣白嫩細緻的軀體，伊便可穩穩的被選爲宮中最美麗的女性了了。（四三四）</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>墨索里尼夫婦</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>為了意阿風雲的日見緊張的緣故，被稱爲世界怪傑，法西斯蒂創造者，歐洲三大迭克推多之一，意國首相墨索里尼，便更爲世人所屬　了。畢氏祇五十多歲，現在除了首相之外，還兼任內務部長，外交部長，法團部長，陸軍部長等職，政務之繫，在世界各國的大人物中，恐怕再沒有像他了吧？然而他的工作雖非常的複雜而叉忙碌，但他對於一切，事無大小，都不肯敷衍塞責的，這種精神，的確是值得我們佩服。</p>
<p>早年時代，他的出身也非常貧苦，他的父親在鄕村中開設一家酒店，母親早就去世的，他的後母是一個寡婦，和他父親結婚而後，的確帶些積蓄過來。墨索里尼在沒有得志以前，也曾到過法國，奧國，瑞士等地度他的漂泊生活，失敗回來，身上一個錢都沒有，直到後來，才到米蘭編輯報紙，組織捧喝團，偶行捧喝主義，而他現在所領導的法西期蒂，便由捧喝主義晚胎而成。一九二二年十月二十日，他率領十萬黨人，衝進羅馬，在這次的政變中，便取得了意國的政權，意王立刻請他擔任首相一職</p>
<p>墨索里尼奪得了政權之後，便主張採取强力的政治，爲人民造福，積極的締造「新意大利」；果然，他就任後，意國的國勢，便蒸蒸日上。本來大戰告終而後，意國在國際上的地位，已一躍而入五强之堂，現在叉經墨索里尼一番改進，自然更是强盛了。不過當此不景氣象籠罩全世界的時候，意國當然也不能例外，所以經濟方面，也是非常窘迫。墨氏不但辦事富有毅力，就是平素自奉也非常儉約，不拘家庭的陳設，個人的服裝，沒有一些華貴的色彩。因此，他的子女，也有此種遺風。對於各種運動，他有相當愛好，在冬天最高興到山野中去滑雪。汽車和飛機，他都能自己駕駛的。</p>
<p>說起了墨索里尼，我們便要聯想到他的夫人；的確，這位夫人，可算是一個最賢德的夫人了·伊的丈夫雖然是一國的首相，但伊的儉約還是出人意外，平常穿的衣服，素樸無華，不認識伊的面目，誰都要當伊是個普通的鄕下婦人。伊並不住在羅馬，而住在羅馬近郊的一所別墅裏，更難得到羅馬的，在交際塲中，人們更從來不曾見過伊的一面，偶然到羅馬來，也是行色忽忽，馬上就要離去，而且行動的消息，又非常秘密，事前决不肯宣佈。因此，在意大利的報紙上，關於這位宰相夫人起居行動的消息，是難得看見的。</p>
<p>事實上，墨索里尼和他的夫人眞是一對患難相共的夫婦，而且他們更是異母兄妹呢！上面不是說過，墨索里尼的後母是個寡婦嗎？這個寡婦，家裏還有一個女兒，當墨索里尼的父親在鄕下開着酒店的時候，有一個小姑娘常到酒店裏來都忙的，便是現在的那位賢德夫人呀！那時墨索里尼也隱居在這酒店中，靑梅竹馬，兩小無猜，彼此便發生了戀愛關係，在墨索里尼的歷史上，目前雖無正式傳記，但這或許可說最風流的一頁了。結婚而後，墨氏東奔西走，起初還不是四面碰壁，但失敗回來，夫人終是百般的安慰和鼓勵他；因此，墨氏的得以不抱消極，不萌退志，勇往直前的奮鬥，終於獲得今日的地位，他的賢德夫人，也功居一半呢</p>

<h3>中國經濟改進之途徑（續）</h3>
<p>— 俞寰澄</p>
<p>六　想像中具體的輪廓一</p>
<p>怎樣的推行我的理想呢？那是很繁複而又一很奧衍的。短時間內。斷講不淸楚。姑目簡略一叉簡略，把大概的輪廓，具體的說一說：</p>
<p>（一）最大多數的農民，是惟一經濟改進的目標。</p>
<p>（二）改進農村，應寓工於農，以因地制宜的工</p>
<p>業，爲農業的副產。</p>
<p>（三）火舉興復歷史上素有的水利。</p>
<p>（四）極端提倡農業化學的研究。</p>
<p>（五）已有的輕工業，宜　用統制與補助；於維持之中求改進，而不宜擴充·</p>
<p>（六）國家應儘可能的力量，創辦重工業；重工業全歸國營。</p>
<p>（七）力求物質上自足自給，不宜再蹈重商主義的覆轍。</p>
<p>以下再就各項約略的說明。</p>
<p>七（一二）兩項的說明</p>
<p>以農立國，以工立國，現在成爲一種談論中國經濟的焦點，彭學沛先生主張：「六成農業，四成工業」·農工並進，（見社會經濟月報二卷五期）是比較合理的話。我以爲農工不應分得太淸楚。除了重工業應該有特著的地點，專門的工人；其餘輕工業，無不可以作爲農村的工作，農業的副產。我不是抄襲克魯泡德金「田園機廠工塲」的老文章，實在有極堅强的理由。寓工於農，似乎太奇創，而叉太陳舊。聞者一定疑心到違背近代分工意義，及大量集中生產的原則，而恢復到手工業時代的現象。這是錯疑心的。我所以主張寓工於農，自信最適合中國經濟的對象，而又合於世界最新的潮流·其理由，是爲：</p>
<p>（甲）中國農民耕地太少，據立法院統計：「二十五省農民五千八百萬戶，平均每戶耕種地二十一畝半，以五人一戶計，每農民僅得地四畝有奇。「而浙江民政廳調査報告：「浙江農民，每人占地一畝九分，」耕地已如此之狹小，其中尙有佃農，占農民全數百分之三十一，（據申報年鑑，轉載二十三年中央農業實騐所調查，）所耕尙非自己之田，其窮乏情形可想。非但機器耕田等大規模舉動談不到，就是改良土壤種子的極小資本，農民亦不易籌到。非提倡農產副業的工業，農村無法救濟。</p>
<p>（乙）耕地少而人口多，農民就多餘空閒的時間。據金大教授白克氏Prof．J．L．Buck所估計；「農民每年僅能做工八九十天，差不多有四分之三時間，完全廢棄。」我國固然沒有機器的馬力可算，速一手一足的勞動，亦苦有氣力沒賣處。尤其鄉村婦女，原有的紡織，旣已廢棄，除了生小孩饚飯之外，鎭日無工可做，僅極少數地方，尙有織絹，織蓆，草帽辦，花邊等女工；大多數鄕村婦女，簡直圈出生產工作以外。食者衆而生者寡，焉得而不窮乏！非想法寓工於農，無從利用農民空閒的時間，更無從使占人口半數的鄕村婦女，從事於生產工作。</p>
<p>（丙）設法利用天然原動力。風力，水力，使科學利用及機械化，　及於鄉間。鄕村舊有用水力碓米造紙者，機械組拙，效用不太。風力則用者絕少。凡未有電力之處，多應就地設法，儘量利用天然原動力。成本旣輕，又不須購求於外。由簡單的科學機械，開農村的風氣，自然農民亦會慢慢的用上科學機械這條路上來。我嘗想海濱山上多風之處，可用風力發電，儲於蓄電池，遂漸使用。無風時，工作亦不至停頓。聞蘇俄已有此種辦法，（見科學的中國五卷一期）。興我理想相合。希望電機工程家，盡力研究，如果用得通，則全國電氣化，更易爲力。汽機及水力發電，成本甚重，初辦時，尤苦電力售用不盡；風力發電，或是促進電氣化一種簡單方法。</p>
<p>（丁）逐漸改手工業為小機械工業，改家庭工業爲小工廠。使家族制度的經濟，逐漸融合近代的物質文明上面講的柴油引擎小磨廠，就是很好的一個先例。</p>
<p>（戊）農村小工廠，其資本或由投資者醵集或由公家偕貸。應邋用合作的精意，除資本利息，工人工資之外，更有贏利，限定於改良或擴充本廠事業或地方公用。務須達到貨利用而生產，不爲賺錢而生產。免得資本主義的流毒，普及於鄕間，造成競爭及欺詐等思習。</p>
<p>（已）小工廠無損於分工原則。各農村原有之生產不同，小工廠之製品，因地制宜，自然亦因之而不同。可以互相交換，隱然含有分工之意。並不是「一人之身，而百工之所為備。」不過若極度工業化的工廠，一螺釘一鐵梗之徵，可以使工人做到終身，把工人造成了機械，毫無生人意味，或是農村工廠所不至有。</p>
<p>（庚）一種製品的工廠，範團較爲廣大者，公家宜劃若干農村爲一區域；於較爲中心地點，設立一模範工廠。這工廠的用意，並不是與小工廠爭利，迺是爲小工廠籌劃改進之道，使他們來效法。因爲散處農村的各工廠，於世界新發明，及運銷販賣之變史，不能隨時明了。由這模範工廠研究發明，隨時指導他們，如何如何的改進，使製成品，不至落後而劣敗。模範工廠，就是一區域內各工廠的導師。如發明一種改進方法，或指導各工廠，甚爲發達，政府就予以特別獎勵。則工廠雖分別散處，仍有連合一致的精神，而無散漫落後之弊。至於各廠聯合運銷，及販賣合作，當然是題中應有之義，公家當早爲之籌劃指導。</p>
<p>（辛）現代盛行大量生產，集中管理，無非一使製品精良，成本低廉，然因爲資本贏利之故，競爭到生產過度，鬧成世界大恐慌。破產失業，鬧了四五年，還沒有頭緒。（現時所謂景氣轉好，是各國盛修戰備，軍需工業，大爲發達之故；並非恐慌輕减，一看全世界貿易統計，及美國各方爭持的情形，便可了然。）請工業化的，萬不可讀死書，再走他人的錯路。况且上面講過的情形，亦萬萬走不上。若工廠散處農村，而由模範工廠爲之指導，出品雖不能十分精良，亦不至窳敗·原料就地取材，成本自輕；農民以餘暇時間，及無工可做的鄕村婦女來做工，工資自廉；鄕村的飮食起居，處處較都市儉省，開支自省。成本低廉四箇字，不待大量生產，已可做到。要抵制帝國主義的廉價侵銷，恐怕亦祗有此一著。我們不能如甘地之用手紡機來抵制英貨，但設立農村工廠，各處交換產品，或亦可以得到甘地同樣的效果。</p>
<p>（壬）農村工廠的設置，宜由各地方政府招集有學識有經騐的人才，設「農工經濟委員會。」就地方情形，選定工業種類，籌措資本，規定原料收集及製品運銷等事，勸導人民去辦理。初創之時，規模不妨簡小，投資宜輕，祗要領上了這條路，自然會逐漸的發達。</p>
<p>以上所說寓工於農的理由，多從積極方面着想。另外再從消極方面，防杜弊害之處，說一說。</p>
<p>（癸）現在立體戰爭，盛行飛機攻擊時代，毀滅資源，是攻敵第一要著。若工廠全設在大都市，我國國防，還沒有充分設備，祇要幾架大轟炸機，幾小時工夫，便可以掃箇精光完結。這是何等危險？若是工廠散設在鄕村，敵人轟炸，找不到一處集中點，自然安全許多。就使轟炸了若干處，亦還不是全部損失。</p>
<p>（子）勞資糾紛，是工業發達後，免不了的事情，意大利的職業集團辦法，我國一時模倣不了。（上面已講過。）惟用合作方法，辦農村工廠，廠主工人，全是一體，勞資且沒有分別，更何從發生糾紛。這是避免資本主義產生的勞資問題最好方法。</p>
<p>（丑）都市工廠，投各往往數十萬至數百萬。好的時候，爲贏利工具；不好，就全成了廢銅爛鐵。以我國現處的環境，旣無國力保護，經濟帝國主義的壓逼，如此之急迫，本夾失敗成分多兩成功成分少。僥俸碰到一個機會，（歐戰時）不過供少數資本家的驕奢淫佚。不幸失敗了，以我國資本這樣的微弱，就要牽三帶四，惹起金融恐慌，失業的工人，衣食無資，尤爲可憫。流蕩在都市中，就不免醞釀危險。資本主義的路，還沒有走上，資本主義的弊害，已統統收到。農村工廠，投資不過數千至數萬，失敗數處，不至發生大影響。工人本是農民少了副業，生活差些，總還有農業做退步，不至流蕩無歸。對恐慌與失業的流行病，農村工廠，可算是一種防疫藥劑。</p>
<p>（寅）「興復農村，」「還出間去，」雖是現時的極時髦口號，然人才仍擁擠都市，好高騖遠的虛榮心，與畏勞怕苦的茍安心，固然使一班青年，不肯去鄕村服務，然鄉村祇有舊式的農業，實在太單調了，亦容納不得人才。一方面鄉村不乏傑出的天才，把單調農業束縳住了，使他們沒有練習上進的機會，埋沒了不少的天才。若農村徧設工廠，下鄕的，不祗是學農的人有用，各種科學人才，都有用處。而鄕村聰明的天才，亦有機會練習工業與科學，使人才不擁擠，亦不埋沒，大學生出路的問題，或者就此得一解决之道。不過我很希望把都市的智識，帶到鄕閒去，而極害怕都市淫　侈惰的習俗，貽害了鄕間。還須預備種種消毒的方劑。</p>
<p>（八）（三）（四）兩項的說明</p>
<p>寓工於農，農村工廠，說了這許多，不過使農民多種作工的機會，以工廠爲　民的副業，於農葉本身問題，沒有講到。農業問題，自然千頭萬緒，至要至緊的，是幾千年傳流下來，歐州學者稱爲亞細亞生產方式的水利事業。從溝洫制度，直到導江導河，鉅細不遺，歷史上都記載着很大的成績，自清季政治腐敗，及民國泯了二十餘年內戰把歷史上我民族最有光榮的一頁，水利事業，廢棄不談。年年閙水旱，歲歲打飢荒，把全國最大多數的農民，坑陷到了絕地·餓死的餓死，自殺的自殺，逃亡的逃亡，救死扶傷，尙幹不了，那裏還談得到建設和開發。上面說的寓工於農，農村工廠，在那種狀態之下，等於晉惠布使一飢民食肉　一一樣，全成廢話。直到最近年間，政府漸注竟到水利，陝綏開渠，蘇省　淮，多有一些成績可見，惟以經費不敷，致計劃减而。减，工程縮而又縮。一面大談水利，一面大閙水旱荒，成一極矛盾的現象。固然水利事業，不能在短期間完成，亦不能於短期間收效。然政府支配水利經費，實在太少。概算　內，査不出水利專欵，僅就賑欵內棉麥借欵（撥交經委會建設項下）分撥數十萬至數白萬，其餘都向地方政府，一推完事。去年中政會議决，統一水利行政案，有「總預算內，自二十三年度起，年列中央水利事業費五百萬元，由經委會按月請領統籌支配」之决定。以我國地面如是之大，水道如是之多，水利荒廢如此其久且遠，區區六百萬元，幹得出甚么事業·江淮河運，差不多動一動就上千萬。政府不言水利則已，若言水利，决非一挑半逗，敷衍敷衍，就算了事。必須下大决心，籌大經費，興大工作，方使全國的農村，見得一些效果。各式各樣公債，發得不少了，獨於全國經濟根本的水利，未有一券債紙。講到水利，就發十萬萬五萬萬公恤，並不爲多。因爲這是完全生利的。而且一畚一鐇，一木一石，多就國內取材，無須購求外貨·如果拿五萬萬十萬萬大辦水利，不用貪汚腐敗的人，挿身其間，實事求是，則當開工時，就可以養活數百萬至數千萬的災民。工竣後，可以多以多闢幾千萬頃的耕地，增加一兩倍的農產。最少限度，是把現在的災荒銷除，或减輕一半以上。那五萬萬十萬萬的公債，撈不轉本？換一句話說，別的公債，多不宜發，祇有水利公債可發。水利沒有就緒，便是占全国民最大部分的三萬幾千萬農民，沒有生路。全國的農產品，不　全國之用，已經彰明顯著。可憐我們除了農產品，別的還有什麼？而且幾時纔能造成別的東西，恐怕日子亦沒有了。我們除了水利事業，先把農村基礎穩住，再來想改進方法。此外更有何事可做？</p>
<p>果能大辦水利，耕地自然加麗，農產自然加多，不過當這鎖國時期，祇要農產品稍爲多銷一點，人家就要眼紅。美國種起油桐來，英國議院裏，幾次對我輸出鷄蛋黃白肉類，發生責難。我們儘管加增　產品，自用若　有餘，同他人交換貨物，不是抑低價值，就要限制數額。抑低價值，是間接榨取我們的勞力。限制數額，是使我們貨產無從交換。我們空擁着這多餘農產品，將同美國農民之用小麥喂牲畜，或如巴西之燒却加非。多產而無所用，仍不能提高農民生活，解晚農民困靴。我們的目的，不是要農產商品化，而是要達到自給自足，提高我們的生活程度·農產商品化，則一般農民生活，須仰仗國際貿易。他國有恐慌或戰爭的變動，就煎熬我們不得了。過去的蠶絲失敗歷史，就是農產商品化的殷鑒，不但我國不掙氣，失敗自不必說；就是日本這樣稱雄一時，遭受蠶絲跌價的痛苦，亦是深切得不得了。他們自詡織維國脈究竟脈造織維擊不住，而須另求聲明綫。我們再部要羡慕農產品化，這種不合理的發展。而要把我們自己加墳的生產，提高我們自己的生活。</p>
<p>農產品是簡單的，不像工業製成品之便利日用，無窮享受。怎樣把簡單農產品，提高我們的生活？那就非仰藉農業化學不可·</p>
<p>美國海耳博士WiliamJ·Hale：「天然鑛藏終有耗絕之一日。一國之化學工廠中所用之各種原料，均可拾棄礦藏油井，及其他天然來源，而取給於農出·將來之農　，决不祇似現在，僅能供給食料，一定要以大部分的農出，從事於綜合化學SynteelicChemistry上，用作原料的作物栽培，以供給我們人類的，日常衣住及建設的一切材料，與夫燃料，　其他各種必需物品。」</p>
<p>海耳博士舉內燃機IoternajombustionEngtnes改燃酒精之例；內燃機祗須將化合炭質節制器，變換一下，並於普通汽油中，滲雜純酒精百分之十或十五，即可增加汽油的燃燒力。酒精用澱粉製造，而含澱粉質最多的玉蜀黍，每　歇而Bushel，可以提煉三十磅酒精，其餘二十六移渣滓，尙爲牲畜的佳良飼料。美國每年酒精製造總量，約有一萬萬加倫，若汽油中加百分之十酒精，就需要十六萬萬加倫，必須將目下酒精製造廠目，增至十倍以上，原料玉蜀黍，亦須增至七萬萬蒲歇而，再若汽油中，加酒情百分之五十，則美國每年需用玉蜀黍四—萬　蒲歇而，比現在美國玉蜀黍產量，要增多兩倍以上。祇嫌不足，何忠其多。</p>
<p>此係爲多景農產品想出路。不過美國生產汽油數量，占世界第一，多用酒精，必少用汽油，農產品難有出路，油　商必然反對，海耳博士的見解，於美國或尙未盡合，倘在中國，則最適宜沒有了！我國現無汽油生產，水炭酒精，正在試用；且有人發明，用植物油及其他原料，　人造汽油，亦在試騐中。假使酒精眞可代用汽油，則　原料，廣種甘薩馬鈴　等，可較美国　蜀黍生產史多。研究酒精製造，使酒精價格低過汽油，不但交通上工業上，得無數效用，即國防上，亦安心不少。</p>
<p>此外如人造膠之製造，電木之製造，均須用　產品。各種　產化學製造試　將成功者，以玉蜀黍　軸，製造酒精，及以相類之原料　糠，　　類，Xylose其他利用農業廢物，製造燃料及煤汽，自甘蔗渣中，取製阿法　維質AlphaCeluose美國農部工業農產司協助，以禾桿及甘蔗渣，製製商業用品上之建築及絕電板，（以上均見第十二年第十四五期農村新報。現在美國最注重的農業化學，日新月異。海耳博士所言：工廠各種原料，均取給於農出，將來或許辦判此種嶄新的事實。我國必須迎頭趕上，必有農業化學，而後農產加增，可以提高我們生活。而後農村工廠，方有　義。</p>
<p>九（五）（六）（七）一項的發明</p>
<p>以上把大槪方針說明了。眞能這樣做去，三年五載，農民的生活，漸漸安定了，農村工廠，辦有頭緒了；我國經濟，可算已經走上改進之路麼？還是不能。因爲現代的國家，競爭得太利害了，一國經濟，必須達到自給自足，方算圓滿·平時交換有資，戰時足以自存，假使我國大辦農村工廠，工廠機械及精製原料，（如化學藥品）仍須仰給於人，我們尙去自給自足甚遠。一個國家的實力，及全國工業化的根本，全在重工業上。我國重工業，可算絲毫沒有（不注重重工業，而大倡工業化，這是我國洋博士的特色。）平時尙可仰賴輸入，有事就全沒有辦法。不論農業工業需要，都無着落。不過國內小農制的農業，需要機械原料甚少，比較上尙屬無關重要。輕工業缺了重工業的物品供給，就都難於動作。假如柴油引擎，沒有了柴油，引擎就成廢物，機器沒有了鋼鐵零件機器就成廢物。一國沒有重工業，斷談不到工業化，就是上面說的農村工廠，亦是基礎不定，我們要求自給自足，第一步是救濟最大多數的農民，第二步是創設重工業。兩者可以同時進行。至於現存的各種輕工業，蕭條零落，大都在死亡綫上掙扎。究其衰落原因：姑且把裏面病根，如技術落後，管理失當，資金短缺等，暫置不談，專就外面情形來說，大約外力壓迫居百分之七十，而農村衰落亦要占百分之三十·因爲國內消費者，大多數爲農民，農民消費力旺盛時，尙可趁外力壓迫之餘隙，分著杯　。現在全國農民。大部分　着肚子挨餓。那裏還有消費力，享用工業製品。銷路愈小，則外貨（兼輸入與洋廠製造而言）搶銷益力，而壓迫愈甚。國人自辦工廠，簡直沒有喘息的餘地。即使裏面沒有病根，亦僅勉般生存，那裏還能發展。所以負最大消費數量的全國農民，沒有救濟得稍轉好况，則輕工業，直是不治之症。我們看棉業統制會，辦了兩年多，極力爲紗廠想法，而紗廠尙是沉淪下去，年不如年。我不知道現在大談工業化的，有沒有把工廠現狀，考察一下過。單說，英國是這樣，美國是那樣，書餅充飢，全不相干。要工業化，一定要從重工業着手，輕工業是不中用的。不過現有的輕工業，投資不在少數，執業工人，亦不在少數，爲全國經濟着想，自不能擱置不談。一面辦農村工廠，一面維持現有的輕工業；目然要把生產和消費，詳細計核一下，不使他們衝突，而且互相利用，維持方法，不外統制和補助，兩方並進。關於統制的：（一）資本之合併與聯合；（二）同業公會之組織，務令堅强而有力；（三）機械太陳舊者，令其停歇；（四）管理腐敗者，干涉糾正，不愆者，懲其經理人；（五）調節勞資，不使發生無謂斜紛；（六）不准濫分紅利，（七）原料之整理，重懲攙水夾沙之弊；（八）非必要時，不准添設新廠。關於補助的：（一）改正稅例，不使外商占優勝；（現行統稅稅則，棉紗捲　，分級過少，低貨負担重，而高貨負物輕，利於外商而不利於華廠。）（二）量偕輕　資金；免除原料捐稅，並减輕運費；（四）技術管理，優良及格者，予相當獎勵金；（五）運銷販賣，務使極端便利；（六）用公家設備之原動力者，（如官辦電廠電力，）予以特約减價；（七　）與國防有關之工業，（如水泥，化學肥料，機器等。）的予補助金。照此辦去，現有之輕工業，當可掙扎脫離死亡綫。不過農民的消費力，沒有恢復，製成品銷路不暢，總無法進於繁榮。其病不在輕工業自身，叉當別論了。</p>
<p>我國要工業化，必定要創辦重工業。鋼鐵，汽油，基本化學工業，原動力機械，水力發電，火車頭，造船，這幾種必須用大資本舉辦。我主張國營者，倒並不是怕資本集中，商人專利。實在我國工商家，沒有這種大魄力，而且事事後起，初辦時定　虧本。我國肉產的鋼鐵汽油，自造的車頭機械，一定不如來路貨之便宜適用。必須經相當期間，幾次改良進步，方能同他們並駕齊驅。不過我們不能貪圖便利，永遠仰仗來路貨。創辦時，這筆賠賬，必得由國家擔任。或許遇着機會，外貨不來，可以免賠，迺是萬一之幸。國家沒有資本則借用外資，亦無不可。惟重工業關係全國生死存亡，不徒經　方面借外資，祇可用募債方式，或賒貸機器材料。至合辦或特許，萬不可用。創辦重工業，千頭萬緒，賞然先要組織一個　員會，網　專六人才，及熟悉國內經濟情形的人，先降次序，定出一個詳細規盡。倒也用不了抄襲五年三年的名目，祇要分期辦理，切實可行就是。在今日國際情　之下，能否許我從　容容把　工業　成？　在還是　問題。「國於天地，必有與立。」旣然重工業是立國的要件，無論如何，總須舉辦。至於成敗利鈍，我們祇求盡我們之能力去應付而已。</p>
<p>假如眞照着這途逕做去，農工並進；我們祇以自給自足爲目標，生產有餘，向國外交換貨物，用意全在提高人民生活程度决不要向國外侵銷，同他人去爭市塲。上面已講過農產商品化的弊害，假使我們的生產，全靠着國外的市塲，則國內物價，就不得安定，一切都要　入世界　渦，紛紛擾擾，無有已時。而且惹起他人的妒忌，賤賣自己的勞力，　商主義之吸收現金，擴張　權，結果徒造成帝國主義之爭奪殘殺。臨頭來一陣恐慌，祇落得大家面面相覷，挽救不得。我們何苦去蹈他們的覆轍？我們吸取了物質文明，仍舊要來發揮我們的大同理想，走上進化的大路，决不是隨人學步，　演歷史舊劇的。</p>
<p>十　結論</p>
<p>話已講得多樂，綜括言之：要改進中國經濟，必須從占全國人民最大多數置農民着想，籌劃確合國情與時勢的辦法，寓工於農，農村工廠，是此次請話的主幹。大興水利，研究農業化學，是推行主幹問題的要着·維持現有輕工業，創辦重工業，是顧到目前現狀，與將來立國基本。不過還有兩個先决問題，郤未曾提到。一個是金融；一個是財政。金融爲資金周轉的來源，財政爲全國出入的關鍵。尤其是租稅政策，與國民經濟，關係十分密切；這兩個問題，範圍太廣大，內容太繁複，一牽涉到，短期間斷講不淸楚。容待他日再領教吧。（完）</p>

<h3>競賽審判委員會聯席會議決議　取消郝春德徐亨資格　京市浙省各有代表列席報告　球類選手決議通告自行檢舉　選手資格問題暫吿段落</h3>
<p>大會競賽委員會審判委員會昨晚九時起、在新亞酒樓舉行第二次聯席會議、討論關於上海市選手郝春德徐亨之資格問題、到競賽委員會主席王正廷審判委員會主席張伯苓及委員吳蘊瑞吳邨偉袁禮敦沈嗣良郝更生馬約翰丘紀祥董守義容啟兆申國權等共計二十九人、列席京市社會局局長陳劍如及京市教練王健吾（代表京市總領隊）及浙江省總領隊祝家聲湖北省總領隊劉昌合等、會議達三小時之久、午夜始散情形如次、</p>
<p>昨兩項重要決議　先由京市社會局局長陳劍如報告郝春德參加京市預選之情形、及浙省總領隊祝家聲報告徐亨經過、討論良久、議决郝徐二選手確曾京杭預選、應取銷資格同時叉議决一案、通告各領隊、凡球類選手、有同犯上項規則者、應即自行檢舉、倘事後查出、應取銷全隊資格、先行警告於是選手資格問題之一塲巨波、暫時告一段落、其公布之昨晚决議如下、</p>
<p>（一）擬請取消上海市選手郝春德徐亨參加本届比賽資格請公决案、議决通過、</p>
<p>（二）擬即通知各單位總領隊有關於球類選手資格不合者應自行檢舉、倘不自檢、一經査山、雖有一人不合資格、應即取消全隊資格請公决案、議决通過、</p>
<p>上海隊自動放棄　因吳必顯之取消資格、鄂代表隊提出抗議、並牽及本市王季淮郝春德徐亨三選手之資格問題、競賽審判兩委員會連日會議討論、函電紛馳、頗形忙碌，茲悉上海市代表隊因忝居主人地位、處處抱息事寗人之旨、爲顧全大會精神、免除單位間之誤會及節外生枝起見、昨日事前已向大會通知、自動放棄郝徐兩選手、郝徐兩君亦已向大會聲明棄權、此種精神殊屬可佩、至壬季淮代表資格已確定、不成問題、</p>
<p>上海市代表臾總代表蔣建白、總領隊邵汝幹、昨致大會競賽委員會王主席委員函云、敬啟者、查本隊選手郝春德、徐亨、參加大會資格、手續完全、對於大會規程、毫無遠背、經檢證送請察核在案、茲以本隊忝居主人地位、爲免除單位間之誤會、及節外生枝起見、願意自動放棄、相應函請査照爲荷、此上競賽委員會主席委員王、上海市代表隊總代表蔣建白、總領隊邵汝幹、</p>

<h3>男子單打第二週結束　徐煝培劇戰許承基　兩個四比六小徐雖敗猶榮　左臂將軍林望蘇無往不利</h3>
<p>男子網球單打次賽、昨賽八組、平青冀蘇四組、於上午九時對壘、爪港馬湘四組、則於下午一時開戰、內以爪哇許承基對香港徐煒培之賽、最爲精彩、數百觀衆、屬目於是、爪哇第二單打曾端才、與香港何家鎏、雙方實力平均、競爭極烈、其餘各組、均成一面倒之勢、結果如後、</p>
<p>北平勝利雙收　北平第一單打解華、對靑島段英山之役、先行開火、解以猛烈之對角抽、連取二局、段努力反攻、投回二局、造成各二平手、解再加四局、以六比四先勝一盤、再戰聲中、段已筋疲力盡、左支右架、應付爲難、遂爲解以光盤再勝、北平第二單打溫亞文、爲新進靑年名手、孤綫發球、及過頂高壓、均虎虎有力、青島陳耕春、藝亦不弱、惟相形見拙、被溫以六此一、六比四、連勝兩盤、</p>
<p>冀蘇各勝一組　河北第一單打張鑫華、對江蘇黃石經、二人球藝、半斤八兩、難分上下、一對牛皮糖、劇戰二小時、始分勝負、第一盤各勝發球局後、黃曾以五比三、六比五、兩度估先、但曇花一現、被張連拔三城、反以八比六勝第二盤、第二槃、黃矢志報復、一再力攻、果以六比四扳回一盤、惟至此黃已疲憊不堪、第三盤中、雖擬振作精神、但體力不支、卒歸敗北、張以六比二獲得最後勝利、河北第二單打、李定頣、與江蘇徐次達、擊法如出一轍、惟李以體胖、不善奔跑、兩盤結束、徐以六比一、六比四告捷、</p>
<p>馬華寫寫意意　馬來亞第一單打左臂將軍林望蘇、亦爲本屆中之危險人物、昨與湖南凌志揚對壘、牛刀小試、未展其長、凌僅於第一盤中奪得二局、其餘均爲林之天下、交戰半時、兩盤結束、比數六比二、六比〇、林勝、第二單打陳其安、球藝甚佳、惟經騐不足、是其大病、昨戰湖南張錦帆、於第一盤中、陳大彈琵琶、野球迭見、一再自殺、湘張以三比一、五比二、一路領前、入後陳漸鎭定、抽殺六有把握、一氣呵成、連下五局、反以七比五獲第一盤、第二盤起、湘張一蹶不振、反攻無門、陳則鋒芒畢露、以六比一繼續得利、</p>
<p>端才初現色相　爪哇曾端才、自大會開幕以來、從未一見色相、技術如何、固不得而知、而與本屆錦標誰屬、關係至鉅、昨戰香港何家鎏爲其處女之作、留心本屆錦標者、咸欲一探究竟、故旁觀者頗不乏人、曾球藝當佳、惟與諸國手相較、自略差一籌、擊法穩健、惜無殺手、故難克敵制勝、何家　爲香港名宿、球技與曾相若、昨戰極有獲勝可能、惜因年邁體衰、不堪久戰、卒告失利、第一盤何先發球、各失發球局、以下數局、情形相同、至曾以五比四局佔前後、下局曾發球、始打破紀錄、以六比四結束第一盤、第二盤開始、情形與上盤適得其反、各以發球獲勝、繼又被曾改變作風、以五比三超前、何雖努力應敵、背城借一、扳回一局、但大勢已去、終以四比六再度屈服、</p>
<p>煒培雖敗猶榮　國手許承基、連日表演、精彩萬分、觀衆極爲注意、昨日下午一時、秩序中列有對港徐煒培之單打賽、而徐亦爲個中健將、劇戰經過、精彩必多、故未至一時、作壁上觀者、紛至沓來、頃刻宣告客滿、後至者環立塲用、圍可數重、惟因有礙後排　綫、故開賽時均席　而坐、　御極漂亮之衣服者、亦不顧也、可見引人迷之一斑、惜乎昨日許承基打來鬆懈非常、砲彈式之發球、及過頂高壓、從未一見、令人失所望、或謂明日將遇勁敵王文正、屆時勢當全才以爭、現爲暮精蓄銳計、故亦不爲過甚、能攻克小徐足矣、此說似亦迎理、小徐一如往昔、絕不苟且、雖自知不敵、但仍努力應戰、竭其全力、盡其責職、精神良嘉、殊堪欽佩、且其犀利之發球、及巧妙之斬球、每使許承基望球興嘆、而博得掌聲不少、亦足自豪矣、</p>
<p>承基苦盡甘來　一時正、許徐之爭、開始接觸、許先聲奪人、速下二局、徐見勢不佳、改變戰略、屢用峻急之斬球殺敵、扳回一局、許再以三比一佔先、小徐力追成各三平手、許叉藉長抽加上二局、旋以六比四獲得第一盤、再戰聲中、小徐仍無起色、以二比三局屈居人下、後上網　殺、頻拖巧計、時以斬球獲利、果然連中三元、以四比三局佔領上風、奈實力稍遜、而許亦不敢大意、劈殺抽擊、數路進兵、一局復一局、頃刻連陸三級、再以六比四結束全局、</p>

<p>一比二敗於粵楊渭濱　單打第二週賽已結束</p>
<p>女子網球昨賽單打四塲、雙打兩塲、除下午山西王春菁王春蕆對河北之雙打、能吸引多量觀衆外、單打因與許承基林望蘇等之比賽、同時興行、遂不爲人所注意、在此不知不覺中、上海第一單打選手茅於文、竟爲廣東楊渭濱所敗、誠上海市之重大損失、幸第二單打魏麥谷輕描淡寫、接蓮授予廣東陳香衛二千光盤、聯以自慰、各組成績如下、</p>
<p>滬粵單打各一勝免　一時起、滬第一單打茅於文即遭楊渭濱之迎頭痛擊、連負四局之多、茅姑娘胸有成行、不以爲意、憑其多年經齡、不慌不忙、徐圖宏展、果然還以顏色、立即收復失地、反使對手心慌意惑、大彈琵琶、茅追成四比四後、卒以八比六轉敗爲勝、觀是盤之形勢、以小茅沉着應戰之精神、不難一鼓而下、操勝利之券、安知反連負兩盤、功敗垂成、寗非憾事、第二單打、滬魏麥谷對粵陳香衛、局勢全在魏操縱之下、陳技術平平、不克一擊、魏連勝十二局、易如反掌、</p>
<p>椰子姑娘　兩敗俱傷</p>
<p>南京對馬華之兩單打、均經三盤之競爭、方分勝負、但精彩甚少、本半在自殺上判分高下、結果馬華椰子姑娘兩組全敗、俱遭淘汰、第一組京黃山農對馬華陸素立、陸女士先發制人、以六比一勝來極易、但旋即爲黃山之農、亦以六比一還敬一盤、下盤决賽、各在忍耐二字上用工夫、三比三、四比四、頗有難解難分之勢、而最後結果、卒以六比三歸山農勝利、第二組作戰時間最久、每局必經久長之逐鹿、形勢至爲平均、但興趣素然、南京陳淸以六比三、四比六、六比三勝馬華李洪章夫人、</p>
<p>王家姊妹　交關利害　下午三時起、祇賽女子雙打兩塲、因王家姊妹之出塲、吸引觀衆不少、對手河北梁紹怡陳煥、技術較差、遠非春菁春葳之敵、春菁擊法兇很、春葳雖遜一着、猶不失爲第一流選手、將來女子單打决賽、定爲姊妹戰、是賽因所遇非敵、未出全力應付、連餉河北選手兩個光盤而畢、</p>
<p>峨嵋山娘　勝來不易　另一雙打爲四川對北平、牛牽馬拌、難解難分、北平仍由單打選手司徒美貞與唐明珍合組、四川則由黎玉萍趙蘊華出席、實力平均、頗爲吃緊、第一盤六比四、北平可勝而敗、第二盤北平又曾以五比四佔優、不料仍以五比七失利、四川穩健而勝、北平以無把握而敗、</p>
<p>單打錦極　第二週畢　連日作戰、秩序繁重、現單打第二週已完畢、今日起開始第三週賽、以前形勢、日見緊張、雙打第一週已畢其半、廣東對上海、南京對馬華、定今日交鋒、以後之四組、定十六日起舉行半複赛、茲將單打形勢、列表如下、</p>

<h3>皖軍力抗強敵　上海險遭山西淘汰　最後一分鐘以三分倖獲次賽權　河北廣東升級浙江福建遭敗北</h3>
<p>昨日男子籃球初賽四塲、均准時舉行、觀衆較幼增多數倍、四週看台均告客滿、首塲湖北對安徽、皖軍雖力抗强敵、終以技術較差失敗、次塲上海對山西、在觀衆預測中、山西决非上海敵手、豈知竟大不然、咋戰來滬選手萎靡不振、山西則人人奮勇、直至最後三分鐘時、尙以四分領前、後辛由尹貴仁投中數球、至終塲時、倖勝晉軍三分、險遭淘汰、冀浙之戰、河北雖有數名手未曾參加、但實力仍甚雄厚、昨日以高速度之傳遞、極準確之投籃、戰勝浙江、毫不費力、本屆奪標、雖無希望、怛至少可得複賽權、廣東對福建、實力相等、戰來極爲緊張、結果廣東多勝福建六分一、閩軍之敗、乃球運之關係、非戰之罪也、今日秩序、北平對河南上午九時、馬來亞對靑島上午十時、菲律賓對四川下午一時、南京對山東下午三時、預料馬青之戰、當有可觀、其餘恐均爲一面倒也、茲將昨日戰情錄後、</p>
<h3>湖北大勝安徽　七十一對三十三</h3>
<p>湖北對安徽之戰、於昨晨九時舉行、湖北隊雖屬一流選手、劉振兀尹鴻祥且曾代表中華出席遠運、實力無容介紹、惟昨日戰來、似未臻入化境、初上塲尤屬慌張、後以鄭森調換、陣容如行完固、安徽本屬平庸球隊、但昨戰竭全力以抵抗、長人張大海、尤爲出類拔萃、胡德文亦矯健可取、雖遭失敗、精神方面、已獲得安慰矣、</p>
<p>裁判員李友珍、鳴笛與兵後、葛克首先　中、繼叉加上二分、劉振元百步穿楊、得功而返、長人張大海、一聲大喝、兩分到手、湖北見事不濟、急調鄭森出馬、三前鋒取得聯絡、相繼得分、以三十四對十四終了上半時、下半時中、皖軍雖極力抗戰、終以實力較遜以三十三對七十一之比數失敗、</p>

<h3>上海僥倖獲勝　僅勝山西三分</h3>
<p>鄂皖烽烟甫熄、滬晉之爭端可開、一般人以爲又係一面倒之局面、豈知天有不測風雲、關西軍之表演、竟出人意料之外、反觀滬軍、則精神頹唐、陣容紊亂、直至最後一分鐘、始以三分勉獲勝利戰術方面　晉隊亦未見出色、惟能人人奮戰、不稍鬆懈、惜行動梢嫌遲緩、喜遠射而不準、是其失策處、否則早可將上海淘汰、滬軍昨戰、一無可取、行動尤爲迂緩、每執球在手、呆若木鷄、致各球迷忿而援助友軍、倘昨調尹貴仁王南珍上塲、結果將不堪設想、將完時稍佔勝利後、火燭小心、大义麻雀、如能保持終塲、於後日次審週中、逢實力堅强之湖北隊、此關恐難逃過也、兩軍接觸　山西前鋒李敏、首告命中、繼又單刀直入、破籃而返、以七對〇領前、至九對〇時、滬隊陸錘恩始拖泥帶水、挪進一球、形勢依然不振、急調尹貴仁王南珍上塲、兩記遠射中的、始成各十一平手、空氣稍爲轉變、此後分數此上彼落、形影相隨、上半時成各十五局面、休息冉戰、尹貴仁兩罰兩中、叉超前六分、山西老李、的是不凡、</p>
<p>半塲遠射　居然成功、上下相差、總在三四分之間、上海後衛、稍一疏忽、老李叉乘虛而進、造成各三十局面、繼叉以三十四對三十超前、其時距完塲僅三分鐘、觀衆爲山西打氣、每見上海獲球、則發出噓噓之聲、惜山西遠射失敗、反爲敵人所乘、陸鐘恩尹貴仁一罰一投、叉成三七對三四、上海見時間已至、不思有功、但求無過、執球盤傳、延摌時間、未幾銀笛長鳴、倖勝山西、十三妹之流（女射箭選手）</p>

<p>下午一時、河北對浙江、裁判張國動、河北爲籃球人材產生地、技術自屬高人一等、該隊於選拔時、健將沈聿功、沈聿勤王玉增等、均因故未被選派、實力不無稍受影響、昨日之戰淅江、仍屬游刃有餘、全隊合作技術尙佳、傳遞尤爲迅速、倘好自爲之、或可奪得决賽權也、浙江隊技術亦尙可觀、惟遇精銳之河北隊、其不敗者鮮矣、戰未數合、河北劉寳成首開紀綠、徐兆雄繼之立功、至十對〇時、浙隊何以校如獲中的、李紹唐獨守後方、堅如鐵壁、浙隊前鋒、迄望籃而興嘆、上半時二十二對九、河北勝、下半時浙軍一度反攻、稍獲數分、然如曇花一現、頃刻又是河北天下、結果四十二對十八大勝、</p>

<h3>北平大勝安徽　直落三形勢懸殊</h3>
<p>男子排球初賽、北平輪對安徽、下午一時開始、結果始終維持一面倒局面、北平直落三大敗安徽、比數如次、</p>
<p>第一局　北平安徽之戰、全塲並無特殊興緻、良以北平雖非本届大會勁旅、但與安徽新成之師相較、則稍相差甚遠、故上場伊始、即鬆懈異常、安徽發球、動輙授人以炳、比球入腹地、亦不知挽救、第一局前半局安徽僅獲一分、下半局形勢雖略有起色、但終屬相形見細、施於二十一比七時終局、</p>
<p>第二局　安徽滿望收復失地、一度曾追至九九對六、似乎此較可以進步、前排略見活躍、然有若干好球、輕易自殺、因此依舊一蹶不振、結果廿一比六、安徽再吃敗仗、</p>
<p>第三局　仍是維持一面倒、安徽振作無方、亦祇得聽天由命、田景堯拼將血淚、灑遍戰場亦毫無生路、徒使北平聲氣囂張、不論迎來送往、無所不利、結果二十一比八、北平三局滑勝、裁判李信標、</p>
<p>女子排球</p>
<h3>馬華竟敗於湘　陳容紊亂連負三局</h3>
<p>女排球馬來亞對湖南、昨日下午三時開始作戰、結果三對零、湖南大勝、比數如下、</p>
<p>勇於內戰　自相殘殺　馬來隊員於一時三刻、先事出塲練習、衣妃色馬甲、端麗昂藏、北平姑娘、身材較大、而樸素不華、於此即可見雙方環境之各殊、開球後、馬來即現捉襟見肘之狀、接一連二、輸去五分、北平前排、進足以殺、退足以守、措置裕如、故分數始終前導、十一對九換塲後、馬來女兒、在觀衆失望之下、益前不成事體、往往球入本區、即自相殘殺、勇於內戰、毫無秩序、第一局遂成二十一比十四、湘鄉英雌、先勝一局、</p>
<p>疾如穿楊　一氣呵成　湖南軍隊、若鄭培坤、劉與珩、似曾受過最高訓練、球來時、得有機會、即起殺心、且動手必效、確履難能可貴、二局上塲、馬來戶畹華發球、爲敵方擊成死球、湖南劉興珩、還過顏色、球出時疾如穿楊、且落點甚佳、馬來中排、殊欠整齊、慌慌張張、幾致無法應付、而下半時湖南魯景秋發球時、更一氣打竣全局、是不但爲馬來球員所咋舌、在旁觀者亦莫不表示無上之興奮、比數二十一對九、</p>
<p>命運短促　時不我待　第三局、馬來酌調生力軍應戰、但對方並不退讓、故掙扎比較劇烈、在各四局面下、鄭培坤小姐、以極度堅强之速力、射球敵區、馬蘭無以爲報、一連幾球、已見換塲、下半時稍稍陳機、馬來亦有對華獲分、然命運短促、時不我待、湘軍已最先達到二十一分矣、時馬來僅十七分、總比數爲二對零、湖南勝、</p>
<p>攻守咸備　不可多得　總觀兩隊球藝、湖南女排球之實力、以初賽各隊所見、實爲無上雄師、上海隊雖聲名卓卓、然以湖南之攻守威備、似亦不免據警受嚇、馬來隊則未見所長、且身材矮小、發球不當、而中路軟弱不堪、實為致命傷也、</p>
<h3>足球　浙靑先後淘汰　冀馬擢陞三級　靑島浙江飽餐鴨蛋</h3>
<p>昨日足球次賽兩塲、上午九時河北戰靑島、冀軍有孫思敬·趙啟春·姜璐諸老將撑腰、而華北守門名手陳而得亦加入效力、益無後顧之憂、終以四對零獲勝、下午四時、馬來亞與浙江交鋒、浙江挾戰勝湖南之餘感、雖抱必輸之心、但紀錄方面羣料不致相差過遠、結結果竟大負一打之巨、毫無招架能力、悽參之至、冀馬旣勝、已入第三週中、</p>
<p>河北戰勝靑島　昨晨九時，河北對青島之足球戰開始、雙方均爲燕趙健兒、脚頭堅硬、實力充足、但河北如孫思敬輩都爲久經戰陣之沙塲老將、靑軍勇而無謀、自非敵手、開賽之初、冀右鋒張德明動矯捷、屢次帶球進犯、均爲靑後衛救出、旋得罰球機會、爲張搶得、乘虛一脚、首開紀錄、未幾冀主罰角球、靑守門失手、在亂軍中叉進一球、靑連失兩球、奮力前攻、內衛空虛、又爲冀左鋒萎璐攻得一球、乃以三對零、上半時告終、休息後、靑更調將士、努力反攻、士氣甚盛、終以合作欠佳、時爲翼軍侵入、而冀軍射門工夫尙差、三次罰十二碼均未中的、最後靑隊軍心煥散、又爲冀攻進一球、以四對零終塲、河北全勝、兩軍陣綫錄後、</p>

<p>馬華氣呑浙江　浙江足球隊初賽勝湖南、球藝似尙可觀、不料昨與馬味亞接觸、竟一蹶不振、輸了十二隻之多、誠出一般意料、昨日下午四時、戰幕展開、浙江隊在中綫開球後、前鋒蜂擁而入馬來亞防地、不料絕佳機會、失之交臂、馬來全軍反攻、姚勝華傳與李以耀、再轉給尹金振、一脚斜飛入網、首開紀錄、姚勝華得中路接濟冉來一僩、劉一之不愼絆人、謝福慶主罰十二碼、一脚中的李以　依樣葫蘆、亦連兩隻、上半時成五比〇、再戰後、浙江益不支、謝慶福再得罰十二碼機會、未能中的、李以耀馬上加鞭、打開悶局、謝慶福將功折過、子　樣一隻、杜亞池單力獨人、一腳入綱、慶福兩腳又得十二碼罰球、先後連一中三元、姚勝華凑成一打、總結果十二比〇、馬一來亞大勝、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>河北輕取江蘇　實方懸殊三十六比四　今日下午廣東對山東</h3>
<p>女子壘球錦標、河北對江功、昨日下午一時在棒球塲舉行、河北精銳成旅、以三十六比四·輕取江蘇、司球裁判員候洛洵、司壘裁判員崔亞蘭、紀錄員夏開明、今日下午一時廣東對山東作複賽（甲）、</p>
<p>兩隊實力天壤之別　河北人才整齊、內外堅强、投手陸韻嫣接手陸發嫣、確實一時之選、出球之峻急、接送之敏捷、珠聯壁合、不易多得、崔慧嫻以善　鳴、個人三次本壘打、將成爲本屆大會之偉大貢獻、出塲選手、莫不獲分、利益均分、一體同仁、其實力之雄厚可知、江蘇小姐作戰勇敢、態度活潑、苦於手法生疏、經騐不足、投手意織雲出球軟直、接手萬壽珍意志不定、而同隊諸伴、亦難收合作之效、惟中堅孫德芳卓爾不羣、獨當一面、稱上上材，為河蘇隊生色不少、值得我人之汴意者、</p>
<p>七憶大勢形成側倒　河北上塲、崔慧嫻一記本壘打、江蘇陣綫頓亂、黃不麟黃秀璉源源而入、第一局河北得三分、第二局崔慧嫻又得本疊打、而河北又得七分、第三角再加二分、第四局河北大舉入攻、江蘇陣內、全見敵人踪跡、奔跑還壘者十一人之多、第五局歸壘者！人、第六局陸韻嫣崔慧嫻各得本壘打一次、河北隊又大批歸壘、先後計七人、最後第七局河北依然活躍、七局共計三十六分、河北隊得意之作也、江蘇隊屈於盛勢之下、困苦奮鬥、難以自拔、幸於第四局中、萬壽珍得一安打、占第一壘、再加孫惠芳之安打、二人同時返隊、得二分、開紀錄、第六局孫惠芳叉因安打而歸、第七局徐淑民不負衆望、一再偷襲、有志竟成、亦得一分、結果河北三十六對四勝江蘇、</p>

<h3>撐竿健將　王禾訪問記　據說破全國紀錄當可不成間題</h3>
<p>爲了要訪問在靑島訓練時曾二度壓倒撐竿大王符保盧的王禾、所以昨日散塲後、直候到六點半、才算在上海選手宿舍裏會見他、記者說明來意後、他纔啟開話匣、他說道「前兩天在運動塲練習、曾越過三公尺八十餘、近日靜養休息、不出運動會塲、已有四天了、以備明日（即今日）下塲造一個擾異成績、至於紀　破全國·當可不成問題、」待他說完記者也就告辭出來、按二人竿跳論資格當推遠運得分的符保盧、不過王禾現在有這樣雄厚的實力、所以鹿死誰手、只能看今天各人的顏色了、</p>
<h3>全運小球表演　定十六日舉行　湖北　省對本市</h3>
<p>全運會小球表演、第一次係湖北對本市混合隊、定期後天（十六）下午一時在大會田徑塲舉行、査湖北隊擁有江潮、萬國榮、符質樹等諸健將、實力自如可觀、惟本市混合隊雖然合作稍差而人個技藝、咸皆高人一等、屆時火併、定有可觀也、</p>

<p>豫一對射　箭姊妹花　上午十時開始舉行女子射箭比賽、然後舉行男子射箭比賽、女子組除第一名爲湘省代表王家楨外、其第二第三第四、均豫省代表　據同行來滬之比南省國術館副館長劉丕顯談、此次射箭錄取之馬瑞蘭、以瑞蓮、均豫省代表、據同行來滬之比南省國術館副館長劉不顯談、此次射箭錄取之馬前淸武探花、現任開封騎射會弓箭教官、名震全豫、一時從其學者頗不乏人、此次比賽中、馬氏姊妹雖未獲冠軍、但其姿勢之美妙、實爲全軍之冠故一時觀衆、稱爲射箭姊妹花云、此一對姊妹、幷將於今日參加表演拉硬弓、該項硬弓、祗少須有二百磅氣力、方可拉出、故雖男子拉此硬弓、亦非所易云、尙有馬氏姊妹之母馬田俊英、亦同來滬、在未正式開始表演時、亦自行表演、其所發之矢、多能命中、姿勢亦甚佳妙、則此一對姊妹花、不愧爲將門之子矣、</p>
<p>幷將於下午在司令台前、與北平選手舉行摔角比賽、以决雌雄、蓋北平選手、亦多勇將、其中如張文山之魁梧奇偉、體重達三百餘磅、誠爲當世英雄、屆時一番血戰、當更多精彩矣、而行政院汪院長、適因公來滬、亦將於今日下午親蒞司令台、參觀此種奇怪罕見之運動也、</p>
<p>摔角表演　掌聲不絕　下午爲摔角複賽决賽先由女子組舉行複賽、旅有男子組輕量中量重量相繼舉行複賽、最後爲女子决賽、而蒙古摔角隊亦參加表演、蒙古捭角隊之表演、大概相同亦每二人一組當出塲時、多來一套舞蹈、而其衣服色澤花樣別緻、故當手舞脚蹈之際、增加不少興趣、當其摔角之時、兩方每起脚互踢、因係高靴、擘拍之聲、煞是有趣、現其體魄雄健臂足之力、又極强大、忽離忽合、勁道甚足、及其倒地砰然一聲更是嚮聲異常、博得觀衆叫好之聲不絕、褚裁判長爲鄭重起見、親執指揮小旗在塲自行指揮、蒙人見之均示敬意、</p>
<p>美牛健麗　榮獲冠軍　女子摔角選手中、有上海代表孟陣麗者、百戰百勝、榮獲冠軍、第一相遇者爲湖南選手彭善思、健麗小姐、竟目中無人、雙手用力猛拖、彭小姐雖爲拖繞一週、但尙未致倒地於是彭小姐起其石金連、向健麗小姐勾去、孟不及防、亦幾遭不測、如是者相持甚久、而時間已到、警笛一聲、暫作休息及繼續表演、健麗小姐、本再接再厲之精</p>
<p>女子射箭第一王家楨女士　（王開及國際社攝）</p>
<p>蒙摔角隊　服裝別緻　下午一時許、蒙古摔角隊、由總領隊思君率領到塲、幷有蒙古球隊選手同來、摔角隊所穿衣服之別緻、引起全塲之注意、藎已一易其前日之服裝、而換上一套摔角衣、上衣係黑皮製成、衣之圍頸及袖口胸前均釘白銅釘、成旋螺形、後邊釘有圓形白銅壽字、亦有頂有佛像者、其褲有紅有白、幷有圖案形之花紋、據聞其所穿摔角衣、刖人均不能觸之、蓋觸之易惹其怒、恐遭不測也、頸中幷套有紅黃色條帶一、直懸胸前、是着長統高靴、據同來之蒙政會某君談、蒙省人民、對於摔角表演、極爲普遍、每年亦有運動會之舉、惟其内容則與國內舉行者大不相同、其節目中有摔角騎馬打槍射箭、對於田徑球隊、均不注意</p>
<p>汪院長今　將親參觀　此次不遠千里而來之塞北健兒、表演旣多精　一般觀衆、均白觀不　、故於今日擬　宴表演、神、與敵周旋、而彭終不支、倒地告敗、是時彭已氣餒、及第三合表演時、不及一分鐘、即行倒地、第二次健麗小姐出塲時、與同單位代表盛桂秋應戰、健麗小姐更乘其大勝餘威、搭上衣角、一拖即倒、再戰一回、又是如此、於是健麗大功告成、榮獲冠軍、健麗小姐係武進人、貌美而力大、誠可調名實相符、與南方人爭光不少、伊方畢業於東亞體專、在校時有美牛之號畢業後執鞭於本市愛多亞路尙尚才小學、今日　止黑版生活、而在家主持家政矣、</p>
<p>豫湘女雄　一塲惡戰　女子組决賽中、尙有河南選手　　良　湖南選手劉英玉互相撕殺、久持之下、各以一勝一負、而不分高下、及後兩戰兩人相拼、戰過全場，雙方均不甘示弱、　持至二分鐘而警笛一聲，暫告休戰、如是者相戰五六合、亦無勝負、各裁判員均無法以判勝負、或有主張　　法决定勝負者、裁判　褚民誼　示公允起見、令其延長一次、幷作决鬥、於是雙方更策疲乏之師、振臂一呼、再登戰塲、雙方扭住、盤旋良久、仍是相持難决、及後鄭小姐用頭頂去、向前直衝、竟將劉小姐衝出塲外、一時圍觀者、均起立避讓、褚裁刺長正在無法判定勝負、乃急中生智、奔前喝止以先走出塲地爲敗、於是一塲難解難分戰鬥、方得解决、但鄭小姐雖獲勝利、而力已用盡、亦無鬥志及與湖南選手尹佩蘭冉作决鬥時、初擬棄權、經褚裁判長說明後、出塲作鬥、不一圍合、已自甘屈服、倒地告敗矣、</p>
<p>北平健兒　戰敗京魯　男子組中其摔角技術、旣多巧妙、叉以力大之故、戰鬥更見激烈、有平市選手張慶、與京代表龍志禮摔角時、龍先趁機將張背部扭住、張亦不與抗爭、祇將龍之衣角扭住、屈腰伏首於下、預料龍操勝券矣、不意張忽旋妙計、將頭頂住龍之腹部、雙手執住龍之雙腿、將身一挺、而龍已一個反牽筋斗、倒於張之背後矣、第二次比賽、張仍施弄故技、龍仍猝不及防、倒地失敗而退、尙有大胖子張文山、亦係北平選子、對手爲魯選手馬淸河、張則虎視耿耿、而馬則沉着應戰、相持良久、不分勝負、及第二回冉戰時、張文山運用其生平之力、扭住馬之後背、向上一提、馬旣立足不穩、竟被張一推倒地、馬旣倒地、適以一足觸及張之大腹、而張初疑其有意暗算、後經解釋、始釋然、稍事休息後、再作决鬥、此時馬圖反攻、起足用力猛踢張足、張仍兀立不動、繼圖扭轉馬身、亦不得逞、尤爲苦者張以體肥而衣小、馬圖扭住張之衣角、張一挺身、馬致無法扭住、故連戰兩個圍合、不得要領、於是依章以張勝告終矣、</p>
<h3>馬探花追談往事</h3>
<p>女子射箭比賽之河南選手馬瑞蘭馬瑞蓮兩女士、係馬仁甫之女、冠鳳蘭係渠之高足、此次由馬老先生領導參加全運會比賽、昨晨競賽結果、單位總分竟得二十五分之多、眞可謂强將手下無弱兵也、記者曾詢馬老前淸是何出身、據談係河南郾城縣人、自幼學習武功、成年後於光緒廿三年丁酉科得第一名舉人、廿四年戊戌科會士、又得第一名、及殿試時始得武探花、現在開封騎射會担任弓箭總教練、本人所教練者注重馬弓箭方面、該會學員多數均係軍人云云、</p>
<h3>褚民誼今日表演</h3>
<p>褚民　誼氏發明之太極球及太極棍、原定於昨日下午在國術塲表演、嗣以蒙古摔角隊來滬表演、時間不及、改期今日下午舉行、據褚氏談、此項太極球棍、於民國十八年發明、曾參加十九年比國舉行之萬國競賽會中表演、獲得最高榮譽獎品、次項太極球及太極棍之功用、完全練習推手方法、因太極拳中本有兩人推手、今可利用球或棍、一人亦可推手、此種球之發明、係脫胎於沙袋、惟沙袋是用手打的、而太極球及太極棍係用手推的、現工商各界學習者已漸普遍、</p>

<h3>今日節目尤見精采</h3>
<p>男子重中輕三組摔角預賽雖已終了、原定昨日再行决賽、惟以時間過遲、未及舉行、故延至今日舉行决賽、即褚民誼氏之太極銅球拳表演亦改於今日表演、故今日國術節目、上午九時爲射箭（射遠）（在棒球塲）男女决賽、下午爲單人器械男女預賽、摔角男輕中重决賽、再男女射箭（射中）女子摔角三項優勝員、今日下午一時、由國術率領至司令台前攝影給獎、</p>

<p>上海各大學聯合會於十五日（星期二）下午五時、假八仙橋靑年會食堂、舉行茶話會、歡迎各單位、總領隊、</p>
<p>四川隊發體育標語</p>
<p>四川選手隊、攤印五彩標語八十則、在會塲散發、並分寄各單位領隊、該隊標語將中國體育各種主張及今後趨、已明白指出、頗具意義、</p>

<h3>網球塲素描</h3>
<p>馬來亞女網球選手搽胭脂、塗口紅、頗似明星派、四川女網球員衣嗶嘰西裝、極爲挺刮、大有少奶奶氣概、京蘇湘皖等球員純粹鄉下氣派、樸素之至、</p>
<p>許承基承位昆仲、日昨雙打比賽、大受覜衆熱烈捧塲、賽畢、被觀衆包圍要求簽名、竟歷一刻鐘之久、此風一開、今日承基與徐煒培之單打賽畢、要求簽名者更衆、裁判員之高橙亦在被圍之下、凌道揚未及下來、因之亦被軟困、其焦灼之狀、可發一噱、</p>
<p>山西網球花王氏姊妹、因最爲覜衆所屬目、昨日雙打比賽開始前、即被「開麥拉」經繞不休、比賽旣昂、數百持有照相鏡者、如衝鋒陷陣、湧進塲去、將王氏姊妹層層團困、結果人衆不能對光、一無所成、姊妹二人於驚駭之餘、乘機突圍而出、</p>
<p>網球比賽、逐漸緊張、故觀衆日盛一日、昨許承基與徐煒培之單打、更吸引巨量覜衆、看臺一抖、不够容納、警衛組組長親自出馬、並派大批警員與數十童子軍到塲彈壓、秩序井然、</p>
<p>男女子網球選手中、有兩對爲同胞所生、而技術亦冠絕一時、穩得本届錦標、眞可謂珠聯璧合、是即山西王春菁春葳姊妹、與爪哇許承基承位昆仲、日來形影不離、狀殊親熱、誠全運會中之一段佳話、年齡·體態·球藝、無一不合乎標準、記者以至誠之意、預祝伊等之成功、</p>
<p>女網球選手中不諳華語者甚多、山西王家春青春歲、上海魏氏姊妹祖同麥谷、一因母親係西人、一爲僑生於國外、馬華女選手非特不能說、亦不能寫、男球員中大半都說英語、故網球塲上、頗有異國風味、</p>

<h3>中學生　學習擔負和敎學時間問題　（一）</h3>
<p>— 一平</p>
<p>現在一般人都覺得中學生學習擔負太重、一般中學生自早至晚、對於功課忙個不了、以至健康摧毀、身體孱弱、關心教育的人們對這問題底嚴重性是不當忽略的、而應當以嚴密的考察精和細的分析、加一番研究、不許有膚淺的觀察和誤謬的推論、現在一般人往住以爲中學生底學習擔負太重、是由於現制中學教學時間太多、這不能不說是一種錯誤、細察這種錯誤底由來、大約不外三種原因、第一、是根據沒有代表性的幾個個人底報告、譬如新近在大公報上有一位陳先生發表的一篇「救救中學生」文章裏、就是稱引某一個中學生怎么說、某一位先生怎樣講、這樣隨便舉出四五個學生先生底報告、就推論到現制中學生學習時間底過多、和怎樣的弊害、未免根據薄弱、縱然所舉的不是極端的例子、也實在看不出有什麼代表性的存在、除了作者自己在舉例時硬加上「有代表性」的字樣之外、第二、是自己對於制度沒有認識淸楚、譬如現行中學課程標準、很明白地規定高中學生每日上課、自習和課外運動總時數爲十小時、在此數內、以一小時爲早操及課外運動時間、但是那篇「救救中學生」底作者却偏要說、「高中每日上課及自習十小時、合計每週六十小時、而每晨一小時的早操尙不在內…」、這眞有點「故入人罪」的樣子、其於中學的各種法令、祇要對於中學本相有明白概念的人們都可以曉得絕對沒有如此長時間的早操、像這樣批評一種制度、儘管很是「辭嚴」可惜太不「義正」了、第三是將不合理的現實和制度本身混爲一談、比如初中算學現制規定一年級每週四小時、二三年級每週五小時、高中一年級每週四小時、二年級每週三小時、三年級第一學期每週四小時、第二學期每週二小時、但事實上各校往往任意增加、而且增加的很多、在「救救中學生」那篇文章裏、也提到一個中學生底報告、這是該文內所稱有代表性的例子中惟一有代表的一個、他說他學校裏平均每日有六個到八個鐘點的算學、這和規定差的太多了、我相信這位學生倒不見得撒謊、而那個學校底校長和教員是在那里發狂、他們一定爲了某種企圖、大約會考罷、所以採用「塡鴨」式的方法來對付學生、去年我曾經參與觀光首都各中學、調査課程情形、結果時數一層、完全遵照規定的可以說是絕無僅有、大致都是加多、而頂多的每週教學時間竟有達四十八小時的、這是何等驚人的事情、難怪把靑年弄的頭昏腦脹、呌社會詛咒中學、不過這是不合理的事實、制度是不能負責的、怎能勝過於牠呢、</p>

<h3>戒烟須知（一）</h3>
<p>— 張仲明</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>吾國自鴉片入關以來。烟禍蔓延。一日千里。上至達官貴人。下至輿隸皂卒。染癮者。何止盈千累萬。大抵皆形容枯槁。精神萎頓。以如斯之國民。當鍜練之民族。如何而能不失敗。語云。物必自腐。而後蟲生。責人則明。責已則暗。已之不振。何尤於人。</p>
<p>自前淸末造。迨至民國肇興。社會人士。痛心於毒禍之日益擴大。無不大聲疾呼。力陳烟弊。何奈在上者。格於財政之困難。未克力行。在下者。見政府烟禁之游延。因循自悞。故禁烟法令。等於弁髦。</p>
<p>迨乎近日。國民政府頒佈六年禁絕計劃以來。患癮者。始覺法令之森嚴。逈非昔比。於是惶惶然。不可終日。每思以有效之奇方。作苦海之竇筏。鄙人之草斯篇。亦聊以供有癮者之參考云爾</p>
<p>第一章　鴉片之性質</p>
<p>鴉片爲棕黃色之膠狀物或粉末。屬贋鹼質麻醉藥。係取自罌粟花果壳內汁液製成。味苦。含特別氣味。能溶於水或酒精中。內含最要成份嗎啡。約百分之十二。及他種贋鹼質。產於歐洲巴爾幹半島。非洲埃及。亞洲波斯印度等處。近來我國亦廣事種植。現將吸食鴉片後。對於身心上各種之應饗。分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）神經系之應響</p>
<p>鴉片本係神經毒質。故對於神經上作用。特別强烈。凡人初吸者。其量甚小。卽一二筒。（每筒約一分許）已足使精神愉快。煩慮頓消。四肢百絡。異常舒適。故好文學者。每用以助文思。忙於事者。賴之以恢復其疲乏。而有閒階級。更恃爲精神上唯一之安慰品。以麻醉其身心。於是一榻横陳。烟霞嘯嗷。個中况味。原非局外人所能想像也。靑年子弟。易受鴉片之誘惑者。其原因卽基於此。</p>
<p>但是美景不常。盛筵難再。精神愉快之日。卽潛伏疲乏之時。麻醉之功效。只限於數小時光陰。一旦時效旣過。身心上之疲勞。依然如故。甚至較未吸前。尤覺困頓。　初吸者。每思　　吸食。以冀其興奮之精神。永維持於不墮。然長此以往。與烟日益接近。而　　以成。</p>
<p>烟癮旣成。而吸者痛苦。亦與日俱進。昔日愉快情緒。至是亦漸漸消失。一方面神經受長時期麻醉後。非用大量鴉片。無以振起已頹之精神。一方面懾於鴉片之權威。更不能自扷。故吸量每隨時間而增加。能限於微量而不逾者。已屬鳳毛麟角矣。</p>
<p>至精神方面。因受神經極度麻醉後。亦起異常變化。大都精神頽唐。意志不定。少年勇氣。遠大計謀。無不消逝迨盡。甚者竟患怔仲心悸失眠等症。亦不少。</p>
<p>（二）消化系之應響</p>
<p>消化系者。卽胃部腸部之總稱。腸部又分大腸小腸．平常食品。先集胃部．經第一次胃消化後。始流入小腸。中間再經第二次腸消化。於是食物中之營養分。漸變爲與人體適合之滋養料。乃由小腸吸取。輸入血液。廣佈全身。至從大腸排出之糞汁。大半皆食品殘渣滓。無營養上之價值也。推動食品自上下達之能力。係基於胃腸之蠕動。（按蠕動二字。卽描寫動物中蚯蚓前進狀態。腸胃動作。頗相類似。故亦以此名之）。在消化時。蠕動頗呈强烈。迨消化旣過。胃腸後呈平靜。是種現象。在Ｘ光綫中。頗能詳細觀察。大抵蠕動强者。每引起洩瀉。緩者易成便閉。</p>
<p>鴉片對消化系。有停止胃腸蠕動之作用。故吸者。無不患大便閉結。吸量少者。或二三日大便一次。重者須隔五六日。至非用灌腸瀉藥等方法。竟不能通暢。</p>
<p>本來大便閉結。爲一切疾病之泉源。蓋人體健康之維持。繫於飲食有節。排洩有時。（每天一次）如果大便不能通暢。則腸中所含渣滓。易變爲毒質。又腸道須長期閉塞後。食物下達。亦因此發生障礙。故吸烟者。無不羸瘦異常。食慾缺乏。其原因雖由於營養不足。但中毒作用。亦不無關係也。</p>
<p>又吸者。每誇鴉片有扶助消化之功。其實則似是而非。蓋鴉片有停止蠕動之作用。旣如上述。故吸烟後。胃之蠕動。立卽停止。蠕動停止。胃之容納。亦因而擴大。所謂解除脹悶云云。乃胃腔擴大之結果。與消化問題。全無關係。此亦不能注意者。</p>
<p>（三）循環系之應響</p>
<p>心臓被鴉片麻醉後。脈膞卽遲緩。腦血管及皮膚血管。則呈擴張。故初吸者。每覺頭腦脹悶。四肢發熱。或發癢。迨烟癮日深。此種現象復漸漸消失。心臟經長期麻醉後。吴極度之衰弱。對於外來疾病之襲擊。每苦不克維持。因而致死者。無可勝數。</p>
<p>（四）呼吸系之應響</p>
<p>肺部爲與鴉片最先接觸之臟器。凡吸入之烟氣。須先經肺部血管。始散佈全身。肺部受麻醉後。呼吸卽徐緩延長。故吸後每感心氣和平。又鴉片毒質。可引起慢性氣管枝炎。按氣管枝炎診候。爲咳嗽多痰。但鴉片有止咳功效。故痰多而咳嗽不劇。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（六十七）口腔炎</p>
<p>所謂口腔炎者。是指口腔粘膜發生潮紅腫脹及分泌旺盛而言。俗間謂爲火氣。這也未免言之過簡。牠的種類很多。普通分爲加答兒性口腔炎，潰爛性口腔炎，亞布答性口腔炎，寄生性口腔炎，壞疽性口腔炎及化膿性口腔炎。茲特分別述之如左</p>
<p>（第一）加答兒性口腔炎</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>加答兒性口腔炎的原因。大半由於溫熱，器械及化學的刺載而起。或因職業的關係。或因齒，咽，鼻腔的炎症波及而來。或者續發於傳染病及全身病。現在再來分別講一講。</p>
<p>（一）溫熱的刺　＝如過冷過熱的食物。（二）器械的刺哉＝如銳利的牙齒及齒牙的發生。（三）化學的刺戟＝如內服或外用沃度劑，砒石劑，鉛劑及水銀劑。（四）職業的關係＝如吸入銅粉，鹽酸及阿母尼亞等。（五）傳染病＝如傷寒，麻疹，猩紅熱，痘瘡，丹毒，肺癆，及梅毒等。（六）全身病＝如痛風，糖尿病，尿毒症，萎黃病，貧血，白血病及癌腫等。</p>
<p>此外酒客及吸烟人的口腔炎。則因酒精及烟的刺戟而起。小兒的口腔炎。則因哺乳後。未能拭淸口腔而起。</p>
<p>本病的主要症候。就是在頰部粘膜及齒齦。發生著明的潮紅和腫脹。在舌絲及頰粘膜。可以察見齒牙的壓痕。唾液的分泌。特別旺盛。舌上常有厚苔。並發口臭。舌外各部的口腔粘膜。常呈白色。有時發生小水泡。一旦泡破。則成淺在性潰瘍。患者口內大都感覺灼熱疼痛。以致飲食往往發生困難。並訴常有苦味及腐敗味。這是因爲食物及唾液起了分解的缘故。</p>
<p>本病的經過。是依原因而定。急者，數日可治。慢者，數年方治。牠的治療方針。第一，須避免溫熱，器械，化學及姻酒的刺戟。第二，速卽治療齒，咽，及鼻腔的炎症。第三，務使口腔十分淸潔。動施藥水漱口。小兒若不能漱口。則用藥水洗滌口腔。一切藥水，當由醫　處方。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（五）</h3>
<p>— 林鎰賢</p>
<p>（第二二問）乳牙到了要換牙的時期，任牠留存，固然是不好，若是沒有到換的時期，早幾年就失去，有什么害處沒有</p>
<p>（答）有三種害處：（一）牙齒缺少，咀嚼不便，有礙消化，要影饗小孩的健康。（二）因爲有了空隙，隣近的乳牙。或是　長出的永久牙，就要漸漸向前傾斜移動，占了這個空位。反致將來應該長出的永久牙，地位被占，只好向旁或更向前斜生，弄得牙齒參差不齊，疏密不均，上下咬合不正，咀嚼的効能减少。其害和前一個問答內所說的更甚。（三）使得牙床骨縮短，面孔就要不端正。</p>
<p>（第二三問）做父母的，對於小孩的乳牙，應該怎樣注意？</p>
<p>（答）應該養成小孩刷牙的習慣，不可任牠蛀壞。一有蛀洞，就要請牙醫生塡補。非至萬不得已時，不可早期援去。並要注意上面所述各個牙齒的換牙期，到了動搖時候，就要立刻援去，不可任牠留存。這樣，永久牙就能生得整齊美觀，小孩一生受用。很多父母，以爲乳牙横竪是暫時的，不去保護牠，任牠早期失掉，這是大謬。</p>
<p>第二節永久牙的生長</p>
<p>（第二四問）永久牙自六歲第一大白牙出後，其餘牙齒，什么時候生的？</p>

<h3>莫利愛氏與醫界</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>余寓莫利愛路，請談莫利愛氏：</p>
<p>莫利愛氏，是法國的大詩人，爲歐洲十七世紀文豪之一，他以劇本和詩出名，他那種諷刺的藝術，眞可謂辣到極點。他鑒於當時一班江湖醫生的江湖行爲，於是用那種冷譏熱諷的態度，一點一點地把他的黑幕描寫出來。莫利愛的作品，有很多是屬於這一類的，可是社會上却因該莫利愛的著作，遂明瞭了當時醫界的黑幕，其實，莫氏所描寫的僅僅乎是江湖醫生，而社會上却把整個的醫界都作如是觀了！於是一班法律家也注意了！訂出許多關於醫　的法律條文來了！這樣，醫生的過失雖然有减少的趨勢，而那救急的勇氣和嘗試的精神也受相當的限制了！</p>
<p>「失敗爲成功之母，每一個成名的醫生，在他未成名之前，試問那一個能免掉無意的過失和失敗呢。經過一次過失，就得到一次教訓，增加一次經騐，經騐多了！過失也愈少了！過失發生的原因，雖由於醫生的學識經騐不足，但是因爲大膽的嘗試和熱心的救人的却居極多數，這種過失，是發生於學術上和道德上，不但不是故意殺人，而且等於從井救人。至失與病人無仇。何苦要故意殺他，名譽是人們的第二生命，何苦要犧牲他，揆之情理，是不是講得過去呢？所以過失這兩個字，根本就不能加上故意二字，除去墮胎以外，幾乎沒有一個過失是有意的。因此，醫生的無意過失，是學術上的問題，良心上的問題，而不是法律上的問題了！自從近年來醫病訟案加多，於是醫生臨症，就特別地小心，還到危急的症候，雖想熱心地大膽地嘗試某種救急方法，但同時故意殺人的法律條文，赫然現在面前，因此，膽也小了！勇氣也沒有了！大家都在提防着，不敢稍越常規，稍有出入，而一班被人控告過的醫生，格外是心驚膽戰，專門產科家連晉通接生都不敢從事了！專門外科家連普通的小手術都不敢動手了！醫生的荊棘愈多，隄防得格外利害，這樣下去，恐怕將來危險的病症沒有那個醫生敢診治了，唉！這是誰之咎呢？</p>
<p>我因爲莫利愛的作品影響於法國的醫界，而聯想到中國醫病糾紛所發生的結果，拉雜寫來，或不無有一點眞理吧！</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（三六）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>有癮者旣下了决心，或强迫戒除，最好到醫院內極爲妥善安全，若在家中舉行常不免半途而廢，戒烟戒毒原則如下：（一）身體强壯的與癮不特別大的可採取直接戒法，（二）起初要用鎭靜藝劑以代替麻醉品，使戒者於數日之内昏昏迷迷過去，，因毒癮最猛烈的時期就是起頭數日，（三）麻醉品除去後無論發現什么老毛病宜卽時用別種適當的方法治療，卽决不再用廠醉品、毒期間大部分的毛病原來是在身上的不過是曾被麻醉呂蓋住的，現在麻醉品一被撤去老病就再發現了，（四）老癮且身體十分軟弱的宜採漸減戒法，（五）戒毒期間有的需興奮劑，如強心，助呼吸，或別械激刺性等藥劑，（六）戒後最重要的工作卽補養身體，補養方法不外乎滋養食物，特別注重各人衛生，服用補血强身藥品，現在旣有了安全的戒法，久受毒害的同胞們，此爲回頭的時候了。</p>
<h3>鎭痛藥類（或作止痛藥）</h3>
<p>在一切藥中佔最重要位置的是這一類藥，銷路最廣的也是這一類藥。全世界銷路每年當在萬萬元之上。賴這一類藥物生活的人也不知有多少。鎭痛藥原料最多不過數十種，但由這些原料中配出的藥品花樣繁多，當不下數百種。本篇立論的宗旨，一不是爲藥商招生意，二也不是有意要破壞他們的生意，三是求闡明科學醫學上鎭痛藥劑的正當用途，以求减少人類的痛苦兼增進人類的健康。所有說明也不是專出已意，確是根據專家實騐與著述。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（七〇）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十二章　肺結核之治寮</p>
<p>第二節　安靜與營養</p>
<p>除開新鮮之空氣外，有二件事情，爲治療本症所必需，患者應該嚴密注意的；一爲身體之安靜休養，二爲營養食料豐富之必要。兩者之詳情，現特分述於下面：</p>
<p>爲什么本症患者要安靜休養呢？我們曉得，肺結核係一種炎症性病變，尋常對於炎症之治療通則，必須保持病部之安靜，乃可速結瘢痕；例若在潰瘍或外傷部分，醫者必施以綳帶，使病者安臥是也。肺結核症自不在此例。所以患者必須安靜休養，使新生的結締組織速將病灶完全圍繞，以助長　痕的成功。這是安靜休養唯一之目的。根據這一種理由，那末，所謂深呼吸操練以及種種運動（一般人所迷信的國術，當然包括在內。）有益於本症患者之說，一望可知爲無稽之談了！</p>
<p>安靜休養的重要，上面已經述過，那末，患者應該怎樣安靜方好呢？第一：對於溫度增高的患者，應該使終日安臥，這一種辦法，看似平淡無奇，其實須絲亳不苟方行的。像每日的談話，以及親友的訪問，都應該嚴加限制，至於寫信，讀書，深呼吸，靜坐法，等種種；都是有害無利，也應該絕對放棄纔好。到了溫度恢復正常以後，比較可變通了；但也不宜過分操切，最好事事由醫師指導爲佳。第二：對於溫度不現增高的患者們，安靜休養的規則，當然不像前者那樣的嚴密了！但除開夜間睡眠外，日問也應該規定幾個安臥時間的，大致在午飯前午飯後吃飯前各一二小時不等，夜間入眠不得逾十時，並且須持之以恒方行的。戶外新鮮空氣的吸取，每日也應該規定時間，最好横臥於睡椅中行之。此外，像戶外散步，讀書，談話，等種種；在相當範圍內當然可允許一二的；但對於病者一般的狀態，以及病灶的詳情，一定要有明確之認識，方可决定允否的。對於描寫情感過甚的書報，閱讀最不相宜。這安靜休養規則種種，有許多病者係不能耐忍的；特殊是療養的處所，和自己的家庭非常接近，此種寂寥的病牀生活，幾屬完全不可能的。這須患者有十分之决心與毅力，方可放棄萬事嚴正履行的。如果在自己家庭據實辦不到，那末，只有入療養院，由醫師督促實行之一法；决不可因循以致誤的。</p>
<p>對於　進行性的本症小孩們，欲其履行上列的安靜休養規則，事實上當然是辦不到的，但原理上係完全一樣的、在清明的氣侯，使小孩安睡於戶外，俾可吸取新鮮之空氣，也是本症很重要的治療方法之一。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>寬容</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>偶然和友人去看大規模的結婚，看完了那友人忽發寗顧一百世沒有老婆的感槪，感慨的原因他不肯說，但大槪是因爲相形之下，每個新娘都有其弱點，於是感到得一個理想的配偶的希望，實在頗爲渺茫。這威慨是不會持久的，因爲一個入未必常常有作這樣純然旁觀者的機會，並且卽使他極　保持旁觀的態度，仔細的觀察，其結果也未必與槪括印象相同。</p>
<p>通常人總以爲自然主義的作家，是專暴露人的弱點的，但這實在不免是誤會。自然主義的作品中，誠然沒有像浪漫主義作品中那樣逼近理想的可愛的入物，但也沒有那樣理想的純粹醜惡的人物。雖然我們讀自然主義的作品時，常常覺得其中的人物是可譏嘲，而且是被譏嘲了的，我們却也不能就推測作者在寫作時早存着譏嘲的意味。</p>
<p>專找可譏嘲的人物描寫的作家，自然也有。但每每要顯露出其故意的做作。綠野仙蹤和儒林外史同樣地譏嘲腐儒，但綠野伷蹤中那樣的村學究，只教人覺得是揑造出的笑料，而儒林外史中馬純上一流人物，却是眞人，在我們平常眞見到時，並不一定覺得可笑，直到被寫出時才也發現。這專讀者與作者的不相及，只是因作者的觀察更完全，並不是作者更能發現其可譏嘲處。在今日看來，虞育德是和馬純上，差不多同樣可笑的，但作者原意，大概决不希望虞育德也成譏嘲的對象，不過旣依作一模型描繪，而每一模型，都不免有其可笑處罷了。</p>
<p>一個人的性格，總是兼具有缺點興優點的，作者能如實地寫川其缺點，而並不加以誇張，就同時也必如實寫出其優點，一件作品裏能不能有此寬容，往往可以見出其譏嘲是否惡意。偉大的作家大槪都不會用惡意寫作。曾有友人和我談起左拉，他以爲左拉的偉大之處，就在其寬大。我沒有讀過幾本左拉的作品，當然不很了解這句話。但如酒店與娜娜，可視作左拉作品的代表，則這話是頗可信的。</p>
<p>我總是很歡喜却斯華賽鴿那本戲劇，最使我注意的却是那流落的異國人菲蘭，那人雖然墮落，消沈，幾於無可藥救，但同時却頗聰明透澈，使人仍覺其可愛。這樣的人西洋作品是常見到的，中國社會上也是很常見到的，但似很少人把他們寫推作品裏。</p>
<p>就個人所見到的說，則離婚中的丁二爺，，可說是屬於這一型的。這本書可說是以丁二爺所做的奇蹟爲結束，這奇蹟自不免有點兀突，但丁二爺所透澈的人情味，是不待這奇跋的成功就很充分的現出的。離婚的作者是極歡喜探索人情味的，但像張大哥那像的人物，其所具的人情味，總不免爲其滑稽性所掩，而在丁二爺身上則對照得很明白。</p>
<p>由丁二爺很可以想到孔乙已，這個人的芷常結束，或者正當如孔乙已一樣。在孔乙已的像上，是否該塗飾一點光彩，自然是疑問，但我們如會覺得孔乙已的處理，已和阿Q的處理已有不同，大槪也不妨說作者在寫孔乙已時，實有更寬大的傾向。</p>
<h3>星加坡港中（上）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>——南國歸來記——</p>
<p>船到星加坡的碼頭，旅客們都得目山登上岸去買東西，或者遊玩一附近的好地方。只有那些遺送回國的失業工人和幾個驪逐出境的囚徒，却還仍舊留在船上，給當地派來的警察監視着。</p>
<p>在艙底睡醒了的麻面小夥子，他是犯法被逐的，一見船停，便睜着眼睛，鑽上甲板來，看見街市樓屋，和遠處長着椰子的園林，都在熱辣辣的太陽裏面，彷彿發光們的露了出來，便揚起兩手，快快活活地喊道：</p>
<p>呵呵，星加坡囉！」</p>
<p>依他的老脾氣，手本來還要揮幾下的，不料忽然看見穿着制服傲然站着的馬來鬼子，正在船欄邊上對他盯着的時候，便輕輕地落了下來，怔着不開腔了。</p>
<p>恰好這時，中年胖商人正將洋傘撑起，向通到碼頭的扶梯走去，看見這情形，便偏起腦袋，心裏稱快似的望了一下，隨即向那一路上常愛拋文的靑年，故意高聲說道：</p>
<p>「走，上岸去，不看看么？你才怪了，要停大半天，悶在這裏坐牢？」</p>
<p>那靑年原是靠着船搖瞭望岸上的，聽見這么呌他，便尾着去了。走到搬運着米口袋和椰子的碼頭上，中年胖商人還掉回頭來，向船上面飛了一眼，帶着椰揄人的臉色。</p>
<p>麻面小夥子向下面作聲地吐了一口痰，立刻掉了回來，顯出不屑與的神淸。</p>
<p>那邊，老頭子用舊毛毡包着足幹，斜斜地坐着，對他身邊的緬甸女人和孩子，用熟悉一切的眼色，把一些巍峨的建築，鐘樓，和升旗山，像介紹老朋友們地指點着。他自己是和麻面小夥一樣，犯法被逐，而且帶有一家人的。</p>
<p>他們的旁邊，擺着剛剛挑上船來賣的麵扣和蚌蛤擔，一些未曾上岸的客人，便國着買吃？光景現得很熱閙。</p>
<p>麻面小夥子便走了過去，作正經地喊道：</p>
<p>「老頭子，我請客。」</p>
<p>「真的？」</p>
<p>老頭子放下了他那隻指點着岸上景色的手，順便就用來搔搔腰幹，一而帶着不相信的眼色，這么問着，</p>
<p>「你不餓么？……誰來誆你？</p>
<p>麻面小夥子認眞地說了之後，還呑嚥一大口唾液。</p>
<p>老頭子本來早就給旁邊吃零食的氛圍擾動了，看見麻面小夥子似乎不像開玩笑，便望了一下熱氣上升的蚌蛤扣子，舐一舐嘴唇皮，說道：</p>
<p>「好，不要請別的，就來幾碗蚌蛤吧」！</p>
<p>順手叉給他的小　子。措了一下鼻涕。</p>
<p>「牙牙伍囉，蚌蛤有甚米吃頭？……我要請，就要請好的。走！」</p>
<h3>站在一條線上</h3>
<h3>在海濱</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>是七月十五到的東京。　氣出乎意外的熱。</p>
<p>生活很　批　—日本話不　說，尤其不會聽。在國內也曾在課外學習了些日子，想不到除了一點能把　住的文法知識外，其他的嘴和耳的訓練，竟會等於沒有。</p>
<p>較我先到日本來的幾個朋友，她們要到海濱去，我也就和她們一道去了。</p>
<p>海濱的生活是快樂的，淸晨有凉爽的風；傍晚有美麗的夕照；有時更有明朗的月。白天雖然很熱，但大海躺在身邊，只要一跳入她的懷中，就會暑氣全消，怡然自得。</p>
<p>可惜的是常常下雨。這時候可眞感到無聊。海是可望而不可及。山是愁容慘淡的站着。悶不住，只好和房東的小孩游戲，下圍棋，彈豆子，跟他們學習幾句孩子請。</p>
<p>有時也去找在海邊的幾個中國朋友談天。</p>
<p>談天是沒有限制的。牠可以由東說到西，由南說到永。又可以從今說到古，從古說到今。如果要說「言爲心聲」的話，那這個「言」字，往往不是指一個人鄭重其事時的言談，而是有點近乎談天時的無聊的瞎扯。</p>
<p>偶而談到一個女同學的死。</p>
<p>一個朋友說：「她們姊妹兩個，容貌太不像了。妹妹那樣漂亮，姐姐那樣醜陋。如果死的是妹妹呢？那還可、惜，如果死的是姐姐呢？那却沒有甚么。</p>
<p>他是研究經濟的。他這樣說了，我不願有甚么回辯。社會决定了人的意誠，在以男子爲中心的私有財產制度下，美麗爲一個女子生存的條件，這在一般男子的心中，差不多是如此的。</p>
<p>但我想起他前兩天的話：</p>
<p>「公司裏的女店員，簡直如同一架機器，一點自由意志都不能有。資本主義的社會中，可以把活人作機械用，也可以把機械作活人用。</p>
<p>當時我覺得他的話很有　。</p>
<p>如呆談天確殖表現一個人的話，那么理論的誇張，豈不也等於播音機一樣了嗎？這就是所謂的：</p>
<p>書本有時可以左右人，但歷史的社會的力量，却會在人的身上，溢長廿一　潛在的意識。</p>
<p>現在回到東京來，已經一月多了·今天是星期，恰逢下雨，一個人坐在書桌面前，聽着雨聲，忽然想起了海濱的朋友的諾。</p>
<p>婦女要到甚么時億，才能擺脫了美醜的條件，以能力的表現而决定自己的債　呢？</p>
<p>這問題的解答，我顧能橫過一切　吟在惡勢力之下的婦女的心中！</p>
<h3>遊園感言</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>因爲是星塲日，在城隍廟的舊書店裏跑跑，却好碰着內園開放，順便去逛了一下，這個地方並不大，然而我却費了一個鐘頭才跑遍了，什么緣故呢？！是因爲擠。</p>
<p>擠是中國人的最好的本領，那天遊的「仕女」，對於這點固有文化，是頗曾發揮了一些的。但使我逗留了這么多時候，原因還不全在此，倒是因爲那園路曲折，盤旋，狹小，後人的脚尖碰着前人的脚跟，灣灣繞繞。上時竟喘不過氣來——然而還要擠。</p>
<p>這毛病，據說是因爲牠原是私人的花園的緣故。</p>
<p>但上海也有幾處洋人私有的花園，大抵都很明朗，軒豁，有成畦的花枝，整塊的草地，可以在裏面散步，奔跑。然而這些是洋派，或日歐化國。我們的呢，却實在斯文得很，種幾竿脩竹，栽一顆芭蕉，再不然便挖個荷花池，架座幾乎佔住全園的假山，於是就曲折，盤旋，狹小，這難道是要自己或者孩子們學會爬山的本領，預備到喜馬拉亞去探險么？並不是的。其實倒是想留一點山水的模型，表示自己的嚮往，顯些雅相，也給孩子們揣摹揣摹，將來好踱方步，遊山玩水，做一個風雅的讀書人。</p>
<p>我們也眞是名教的信徒。</p>
<p>所以，倘在喝茶，就大抵是苦茶；寫起文章來呢，是贊成秋天的澹泊，却不大熱心於春天的蓬勃。但徜說這是漸近暮年，有了衰敗的預感了罷，也不盡然。這些唉聲嘆氣的，其實倒是三十左右的靑年，還說不上老，也决不至於衰的。他們的先輩留下了曲折，盤旋，狹小的環境步，鍍方步，弄袖子管，搖搖擺擺，他們生長在這個內園式的社會裏，慣了。</p>
<p>然而我們就永遠只能慣下去麼？</p>
<p>那回答是：是的。內關不變，內園的一切，也很不容易變的。現在城裏的內閱，原曾經過一番重修，但因爲要保持舊觀，所以到現在還是曲折，盤旋，狹小，「點也看不出新的氣象來。要改變這個「慣」，就必得有犧牲。把眼前的假山拆去，　池塡平，這才能有新鮮的草原，明朗，軒豁，可以供我們散步，奔跑。</p>
<p>遊了內園，想寫一篇記，但仍舊只是一點感想。</p>
<h3>名譽老婆婆（六）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>戰爭連續得到勝利，死傷也就祇有日益加多。當初的歡天喜地的歡呼，如今已經帶上了悲壯的色彩。衙門，在鄉軍人，和小學校等等的慰問人員已經不能不每天活動着，忙於遺族訪問。而且一切都給掩蓋在名譽這兩個字下面。實際上，如果不是曾經在那種空氣當中生活過的人，也許不能够想像到：在當時，「名譽」這兩個字，究竟有着多少魔術的效果。無論怎樣可憐的遺族，都給人們用名譽兩個字去加以安慰。</p>
<p>燒飯老婆婆也從這個時候起莫明其妙地變成了陰鬱，沈思，看起來，　經跟從來的情况完全不同；當人們在談論着戰爭的時候，她却好像極力避免央聽它。不用說，她已經成到：那從來都好像眼自己沒有關係的戰死或是負傷，已經不是別人家的事情了。因因這造也正在旅順口打着仗。</p>
<p>她變得比從來更加迷信了。城裏所有的寺廟和神社她都跑去參拜。簡直像個狂信者。</p>
<p>「南無阿彌陀佛，南無阿彌陀佛。」</p>
<p>她上璧做活，一璧不絕地念着佛。而且，人家還聽見她在廚用裏一壁在淘米或是燒火，一壁就擺出非常專心的神色，獨自喃喃地說着話：</p>
<p>「苦蕯！佛爺！我只有一個爺一個兒子。請你保護他的生命吧！請你　我這老命拿去代　我的兒子。　　吧，請你幫幫忙　菩薩！　爺！你是個親切的人物，你很知道我是多麼愛惜我的兒子。庇佑，庇佑，菩薩！佛爺！</p>
<p>這當兒。在她的鼻尖是，那流下來的眼淚，就跟水滴　地在發亮。</p>
<p>有時候，她會突然地喧嚷起來，一碰到人，就不管是誰個都把你拉住，飛濺着　沐，　你說着這樣的話；</p>
<p>「喏，人們横豎遲早都要死去。我跟你也要死去的，就是我的兒子遲早也會有一次比。反正都得死，那就還是死在戰爭裏好。因爲那是名譽的戰死。——我是這么想的。可不是嗎？噯？」</p>
<p>在她的閃亮的瘋子般的眼眼　裏面，好像可以看出那種給勉强地壓迫着的無限的苦惱。無論　價看到她那一對眼睛，都今深深地對她表同情。人們都溫和地擾受她的話語，慢慢地對她加以安慰。</p>

<p>醫學特刊</p>
<h3>發刊小言</h3>
<p>— （羅敏修醫師）</p>
<p>本刋今日得與諸位讀者初次相見。我們應將方針和願望。先在此說明一下。聊作爲發刋本醫報的小言。</p>
<p>東非風雲緊急。已不幸驚動干戈了。雖有指爲局所的地方事件。或恐不免影響於他方。我國人如再醉生夢死於長夜漫漫之中。沉酣逸樂於花天酒地之間。甘自暴棄。竊恐大好神州。行有淪亡之禍。優秀民族。終被病夫之誚。雖然聞雞起舞。枕戈待旦的。固大有其人。然已文弱成風。其奈缺少體魄之雄健乎。求雄健之道。非注意衛生及醫藥不爲功。有嗜好者力戒。有宿疾者圖治。俾弱者健身。國人皆作如是想。已足挽頽靡之風習而有餘。醫有法。治有方。醫藥之旨。更須介紹於一般民衆。使有相當的認識。否則必至南榬北轍。所以本報的發刊。一以介紹近世醫藥之槪况。足爲國人之偕鑑。復以指導病者求治途徑。以盡爲醫者之天職。那就是區區編輯本刑的微旨哩。</p>
<h3>白帶症</h3>
<p>— （屈婉芬女醫生）</p>
<p>白帶最爲婦女界厭惡而普遍的毛病。可叉沒有良法阻止它與婦女界絕緣。患白帶病而久延勿治。必至妨碍生育。影響月經。面黃肌瘦。精神憔悴。故亦未可輕忽視之。上海法租界寗波路六十四號。孫緯才父子醫院內。王豫初女醫生。治療此症有深切的研究。豐富的經騐。如其要明白本症是否含有淋菌。就可用高倍顯微鏡來檢査。女界的往騐者。並月可以享受免費的優待。如其一般羞於就醫。或醫治不便的。那末王醫生處。還有「內服白帶丸」和「外用白帶藥」二種藥的發售。也是極有效騐的。價每種每盒各售二元。乃婦女白帶病自療唯一良劑也。</p>
<h3>論小兒病</h3>
<p>— （孫爲瑞醫師）</p>
<p>小兒病。雖稱啞科。可是總比不上成年人病的來得複雜而不易治。其所以致病的原內。大槪不外飲食方面的不愼而成腸胃病。感冒方面的發熱抽筋。夢寐不安·夜啼·或寄生虫病等爲多。所以治小兒病的醫生。如能究心於這幾項大多數的原因。治療上當不至南轅北轍。予臨診時。常用法大馬路西新橋街轉角。金城大藥房經售之「寗兒金丹」。頗能得心應手。因爲「寗兒金丹」。就有上述幾種病症的功能。所以藥到病除。也算不得爲異數。「寗兒金丹」每包售洋一元。外埠寄費。另加二角。（編者按。孫爲瑞醫師。對於治療小兒各病。診斷詳細。治法妥善。經騐豐富。爲海上有數之兒科專家。診脈在法租界寗波路六十四號便是。所介紹「寧兒金丹。」爲小兄病起死回生之唯一效藥。家有病孩者。服之卽保安寧如常也。）</p>
<h3>疥癬與內病的關係</h3>
<p>— （藥師馬胤）</p>
<p>疥癬發生的原因。大家都知道他是微生虫的關係。所以治療疥癬的方法。唯一的便是殺虫。如其殺虫的力量有些不足。那末未及殺死的微虫就要向裏奔避。以致引起全身症狀的內病。這就是一切普通癬藥的流弊。舊病復發。不能永久斷根。也就是這個緣故。「甘露藥水」的發明者。早已明白了此旨。所以竭力避免這個流弊。不論新病舊病。疥瘡癬疾。一經「甘露藥水」治療。大有藥到病除之概。藥力雄健。只要微虫接觸着。决沒有不立即殲滅的。所以效驗靈速。也沒有任何遺患。人家都說它是一切皮膚病的聖藥。最確當不過的。每瓶售洋一元。上海法租界西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售。外埠郵購。每件加寄費二角。</p>
<h3>爲戒煙同胞義務指導</h3>
<p>— （魯之俊醫師）</p>
<p>說到戒煙。實在是極其容易的事情。只要有决心。能立志。沒有不可戒絕的道理。不過吸煙的人。在應酬塲中而得到烟癮的固然不少。可是爲了精神的不濟事。身體的太不行。而無可奈何地被染着。要佔多數。不要說一天不吃。或者幾日不吃。祇須過了時便要脫癮。到了那時。就有難以言語形容的痛苦。有經騐的同志們不難想象得之。所以戒煙便成爲問題。要請教醫生了。好了。現在有位戒煙聖手。佘震醫師。善能體會病人。免除種種痛苦。時時顧慮到病人的身體。决計不會像那輩毛手毛脚的醫生們可比。一方面漸漸抽減阿片的成分。一方面就用相當的補品來輔助身體的不足。如「保力登」之類。（按保力登爲戒煙期中惟一之袖品。每瓶售洋二元。本埠法大馬路西新橋街口。金城藥房獨家經售。）所以已經戒絕了的同胞們。都交口稱譽。佘醫師就成爲唯一的戒煙聖手了。佘醫師是常寓上海法租界寗波路孫緯才父子醫院內的。有决心戒煙的同志們。就請到這裏去。要算千妥萬妥了。</p>
<h3>哥那多登之功效</h3>
<p>— （顧振羣醫師）</p>
<p>本埠法相界西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售之治淋聖藥「哥那多登」。久爲醫藥界所公認而樂于應用與推銷。凡淋病之初起者。一服可愈。即號稱難治之慢性淋症。三四盒亦可斷根。該藥能透膜殺菌。直達病所。消炎止痛。利尿滅淋之功特偉。而對於身體毫無影響。不碍生育。且由淋濁引起之睪丸炎。或横痃等。皆有大效。每盒祇售洋二元云。外埠郵購。另加寄費洋二角。</p>
<h3>「萬克能」與神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— （陳醒箴醫師）</p>
<p>現在做什么事業的人。都在劇力地競爭。十分操勞思想。所以害神經衰弱的人也最多。什麼是神經衰弱的表現呢。就如面黃肌瘦。飲食少進。神疲力乏。多夢少寐。滑精早洩等等。如其不去速求醫治的話。尋至日漸加深其程度。神經病。精神病。都是出於這樣開始的。至於最好的醫治方法。莫如補充身體的滋養料。以恢復思想操作的疲勞。人體內最爲重要的滋養料。當然要推蛋白質。一萬克能』就是蛋白質之製劑。並配以袖腦安神之品。故治神經衰弱。最爲有效。每瓶售洋三元。本埠法租界西新橋街口。金城大藥房獨家經售。</p>
<h3>腺病與咳嗽</h3>
<p>— （黃思顯醫師）</p>
<p>凡胸廓狹小。肺量不足。而胸腺肥大者。謂之腺病。腺病之大。呼吸器之抵抗力弱。每易感冒。感冒而咳。咳而損肺。卽癆菌侵襲之極好機會。故腺病者。卽所以表示敏感肺癆。亦即肺癆之體質。我國患腺病者甚多。故肺癆亦甚多。然欲强國强民。非盡力消除肺癆不可。而對於腺病之人。尤當有矯正之必要。腺病而患咳嗽者。更應切實治療。則「咳立蘇」者。確有潤肺豁痰止咳平喘之功。服之頗爲適當。更如「萬克能」者。營養滋補之力甚强。補腦益血。健胃生津。增加人體抵抗力。自亦屬體弱者。平日調理所不可缺之要品也。（編者按。『萬克能」與「咳立蘇」二藥。功效確實可靠。「萬克能」每瓶三元。「立蘇」每瓶售洋二元。均屬上海法大馬路西新橋街轉角。金城藥房經售也）。</p>
<h3>病從口入</h3>
<p>— （陳培基醫師）</p>
<p>人莫不欽食也。民以食爲天。食之與人生。大，矣哉。口爲整個消化系統之始端。胃爲整個消化系統之總樞紐，所以胃病之多。無出其右。因胃病而牽動全身者。實比比馮。古人云。病從口入。有以也。砍求胃之不病。首在食物時之注意。旣不可雜食。復不可急食。西諺有云。細嚼緩咽。已得消化之半。旨哉。如已病者。當急求醫。求醫不如選藥。上海法租界西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售之「胃必靈」。專治一切胃病。神效無比。每盒僅售一元云。</p>
<h3>爲什麼要生雀斑</h3>
<p>— （藥師龍飛）</p>
<p>雀斑是面部上平滑不高突的細碎的褐斑。如其疏疏淡淡。那倒沒有什麼關係。如其密而深濃。發現於面部上之最爲顯露處。實在有些厭惡。尤其最爲摩登的少女所痛恨。有人引一句成語。呌做「白璧之玷」。最爲確切不過的。關於生斑的原因。一者是色素沉澱。二者是皮膚血行不通暢。產出物不容易散失和吸收。「美容除斑面麗香膏。」就能矯正這個弊病。並能予皮膚知覺神經以適度興奮和快感。所以使用過的莫不笑逐顏開。交口稱譽。該藥每瓶售洋一元。本埠法大馬路西新橋街口。金城大藥房經售。</p>
<h3>月經病特效藥</h3>
<p>— （程芳女醫生）</p>
<p>月經爲婦女生理的作用。出之自然。如遇障碍。勢必發生疼痛。引起四肢酸軟無力。劇甚時則有頭痛。眩暈。倦怠。嘔惡。胃呆等症。本埠法大馬路西新橋街轉角。金城大藥房經售之「好力朋。對於婦女月經期内各種疾患。如月經困難。過多過少。月經疼痛。四肢無力。耳嗚眼花。一切不快感覺。服後無不功效顯著。故與婦女界結了不解之綠。稱爲月經病之特效藥。每瓶售洋二元。外埠郵寄另加二角。</p>
<h3>電氣治病</h3>
<p>— （記者）</p>
<p>上海爲花柳病充斥之區域。電氣療治之於花柳病。爲無上之唯一妙法。本埠法租界寗波路六十四號。孫緯才父子醫院。備有愛克司光機。人工太陽燈。透熱電療機。提亞斯電撩機。短波透熱電療機等。無不應有盡有。聘有專門醫師。主持診務。故就診者絡繹於途。並爲便利女界起見。復聘有女醫生。另闢雅室。隔別治療。至於取費之廉。更屬難能云。</p>

<h3>東菲大屠殺</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>東菲戰爭，業已爆發，三日意國不宣而戰，陸空軍一劉出動，分北東南三路，猛烈進攻，實行大屠殺。相持十個月的意阿事件，現在意國已向阿國投擲其第一彈，將全世界空氣攪動起來。墨索里尼的野心，在這裏暴露無遺，兩軍接觸後，阿國卽對國聯提出抗議，意國亦將其行動，通告國聯。近日日內瓦和平殿堂，不免又被搗毀。</p>
<p>意阿開火，雖不過旬日，但戰事甚形猛烈，兩方皆有奇重損失。聞馬達化的意軍，三日由墨氏二子一婿，率領飛機隊，向阿杜華猛炸。婦孺與兵士，死傷約近二千，景象甚慘。齊亞諾且將阿杜華的王宮炸毀，首建大功。墨氏有婿英勇如此，亦足自豪。</p>
<p>意國此次進軍，有一黑種阿斯加里軍隊，加入作戰。此輩黑種軍士，幾為活動的火藥庫，携有機關槍，短槍，手槍及大刀等兵器。當開入阿境時，且以土語高唱，誓割阿皇之鬚，製成小刷，以刷墨索里尼之靴。有些人看到此一節，或不免要大罵阿斯加里人一聲無恥。我以為儘可不必。這班黑人，原無殘殺同種之意，恐係一時受人迫脅。等來日阿王之鬚果然被割，製成小刷，他們便要覺悟，自己不過是一個奴隸，只配給墨氏刷靴，後悔已經不及。</p>
<p>意阿之戰，將來勝利誰屬，此事甚難預料。以實力論，阿國當非意國之敵。以民氣看，阿國全國同仇敵愾，已抱有誓死抗敵的決心，亦非可輕悔者。然意阿戰爭，不限於東菲一隅。觀近日英國行動，大有對意實施裁制之意。一方面意國已聲稱，有敢言裁制者，原以戰爭相週旋。可見由意阿之爭，引起英意之戰，實有可能。不但如是，星火可以燎原，說不定還會因以擴大而為二次大戰。今日意阿戰爭，或卽是下次大戰的序幕。</p>
<h3>貨郎</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>—古城印象記—</p>
<p>在古城裏顯著的：是賣雜貨的貨郎；平時，貨郎只賣一些針，線，頭繩，木梳，紐扣同一些女人用的零碎的小東西，有時也賣那上海市街風景的照片，不過那是稀少的呢。貨郎的手中持着一把小搖鼓，揹上了玻璃櫃，在大街小巷各處走動，小搖鼓也到處響着。在下午，烏民的屋脊上喘著黃色的太陽光，整個的古城在寂寞的當兒，貨郎的小搖鼓在灰沙迷離着的空間，「得嚨嚨嚨嚨」地會響上大半天，沒有詩韻的節奏，可是聽去也還輕鬆，舒適。這時在樓頭佇立著，可以看見破帽子在空中動着，動着，打胡同口進來，一步一步地在移動，停住在隔壁裁縫店門。小搖鼓仍「得嚨嚨嚨嚨」的響着，現在可以瞧準了，在那破帽子下面的，由於一種習慣裝成的笑容，一張壓得扁扁的知趣的臉子，眼光丟在行路的女人身上和殷勤地惠顧的女人們。</p>
<p>在這時湊趣的孩子們，常會牽引着爸媽到貨郎這裏，要一二張上海馬路風景照片；這一注東西，在貨郎生意是滿好的，一百張照片會不上四五天賣得精光，可是貨郎們賣這注東西只很稀少，找十個貨郎問一下，只有二三個是賣這照片的，也問不出來一個確實的道理。</p>
<p>女人們缺少了針線一類的小東西，找上了那賣雜貨的貨郎，在玻璃櫃旁邊七嘴八舌的要這樣，要那樣，倒了像翻田　藍子一樣，只是打成一片喧噪的聲音。於是貨郎將一件一件東西在玻櫃裏里拿了出來，堆上了一股　勁，老說着　一套話：「慢慢來，慢慢來！大家都有的」說着，他指着東西，貨郎也算一個很能斡的小商人吧，他知道誰問他要什麼東西便給什麼東西，沒有幾分鐘一切都停當，然而讓顧客們付清錢拿東西；倘便身邊沒帶零碎錢的，也可以賒帳隔幾天再給。每一個貨郎都是會做生意和知趣，他會同不認識的人問安請好。</p>
<p>小裁縫店裏，每次也要問貨郎要幾件紐扣和針線這一些東西，而裁縫店是掛賬的；逢着年關節頭結帳付清，錢是少不了一文的，交易也公平，這也許由於古城民性的愚樸和誠實吧。</p>
<p>什麼皆弄好，交易也定，貨物揹上了玻璃櫃搖着小搖鼓，出了胡同。在遠處，我也可以聽到這小口，鼓聲，「得嚨嚨嚨嚨」地在響，只是寂寞地響在灰沙裏面，在古老的城裏。</p>
<p>看着貨郎的小搖鼓，時常我想起故鄉裏　的貨郎。我的故鄉裏的貨郎也是和這古城的貨郎一模一樣，只是一些大同小異吧。故鄉裏的貨郎也是手中持着小搖鼓和揹上了玻璃櫃，賣一些針，線，頭繩女人用的零碎的小東西，而所異的是并不上城內去賣。我們那裏城內的市面是鼎盛的，所以貨郎只在四鄉八鎭走動，拿着小搖鼓在村道上跑。倘使尖着耳朶，也可以隱約地聽到遠處的「得嚨嚨嚨嚨」的鼓聲響着。</p>
<p>而這個古城裏的市面比不上我們那裏，寂寥和蕭條這是古城的本色吧。所以貨郎能在別處運了一些東西，在城內賣買着，而并不下鄉去，這也是古城畸形發達的一種吧。</p>
<h3>剪辮子的故事</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>蜿蜒的，巍峨的山城，牢固地封鎖了這甲村與乙村間似乎老死不相往來的人們的思想，隔斷了不禁止瞭望遼闊底世界的人們的視線，山，水，青山，綠水，這就是我們村里人們談論的資料，展視的世界。</p>
<p>纔五歲的我在一個私塾里讀書，清晨我們尚末散早課的時候，那位帶近視眼鏡，鞋刷鬍子，李老先生忽然矜持着懂得外界的潮流他說</p>
<p>「於今皇帝…沒有了，沒…沒有了，嗯！反了！反了！…聽說要把辮子剪，是剪辮子！不過，這倒是一件…好事！辮子，討厭！」</p>
<p>他說　本有點結，同時左　　辮子根下骚了几下，右手約有四　長的指甲，在左手指甲裏黑摳着，找出一黑粒擺在桌面上，鼻和眼嗅了一會，大姆指向桌上一按，小的啐聲發出來，啐聲雖為讀書聲掩沒，但大一點的孩子都知道那是虱子，他們不敢笑出聲，靠近先生一點便把書頓　來遮掩他的笑臉，程度高一點，便有低程度學生假裝請他告書，順便告訴他，相等的便咳嗽一聲，再把嘴巴，向先生一揪，不到一刻便全堂十余個人都知道了。我是認為「人小鬼大」的，這事情我早知道，於是我陪着他們失聲一笑，笑的原料太足了，竟鼻子鼓了一大串出來，這時先生正在踱方步，好像自負他識時務，剛走到我跟前，聽到了我的笑聲，便賞賜一釘拐，我笑聲末已，馬上轉舵哭出來。</p>
<p>我傷心地哭着，像受了莫大的冤屈。</p>
<p>同學們㗫㗫地笑，那聲音顯然不是讀書可以掩蓋的。</p>
<p>「哪！」先生走到他自己的座位上拍驚堂木。</p>
<p>他把他那烟筋似的吊在背後的辮子掉了掉，「剪脫是好事，不過沒有了皇帝，沒有了皇…反了，反了！」</p>
<p>散早課走出了校門，校是設在一座頂高的山尖上的古寺裏的，站在寺前，可突出山圍眺到遠處，遠處是漫彌在浩瀚的烟海中的。</p>
<p>「就是那裏在造反；就在那裏！」</p>
<p>小孩子心地上雖有着未來的光明，但他們的眼界是小的——，也對鎖在山圍裏，山外便像是外國，便是造反的地方。</p>
<p>回到家裏，我額上隆起了一個小包，山阜那末地，母親痛在心內問長問短，那同情的眼，慈愛的態度，助長了我驕勢，我扭扭捏捏在便大哭。</p>
<p>「哭什麼！——不用功讀書，先生打了你？」</p>
<p>父親剛從農場裏回來，他一向對我不大客氣，一面說一面還瞪我一眼，這一眼把我原來沒淚的哭也嚇出淚來了。</p>
<p>母親代表說過一遍，父親注意的倒不是打我的問題，而是剪辮子的問題，他說：</p>
<p>「先把我辮子剪掉，又要梳，又多油，剪了多方便！」說句現在時髦的話，父親像是「前進的人物，雖然他的出發點是唯利主義。</p>
<p>你要做和尚？—我不高興做和尚的老婆，」母親把我抱到身上，「你也不做和尚的兒子，」母親像拿總罷工要挾資本家的手段來對付父親，</p>
<p>「你就做尼姑，他就做小和尚。」父親接下去是一個大哈哈。</p>
<p>然而別瞧那李老先生頗有魔力，這消息大概由同學們分別傳到家內，後來又傳開去，全村人都轟動了：先生是「讀聖賢書」的人，說話總有根據。</p>
<p>幾個冒失後生子，你偷剪我的，我也報復你，沒多少時候，披頭散發的人便多了，但一見面便呼着「毛頭鷹，出他外祖母家裏的醜。」這是老太婆們的態度，而後生女人一見了剪辮子，便拜天拜地的笑。</p>
<p>後來竟演成一　風氣了，但老人家剪辮子便不是那麼草率，記得我父親「下發」的那天，在神主前點燈裝香，還加四跪八拜，我母親也敵不過那潮流的沖擊，而操刀的還是她自己，一剪刀，父親的辮子和頭便分家了，父親恭敬地把牠擺在香爐上，做什麼呢？恐怕他也答不出，而我的頭上僅留一個「馬桶蓋」，所以免了一刀之厄。</p>
<p>——是民國了，民國不要辮子了。</p>
<p>後來這山城裏才透進這一個消息，而我們的那位李先生也只留下一個禿尾了。</p>
<p>從剪現在已二十四週年了！</p>

<h3>請客</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>朱大爺家里今天大張筵席，是這鎮上亘古未有之奇蹟了。雖然朱大爺是這鎮上的首富，他交結的都是有名望的人物：但是他們來來去去總是像犯法似的，秘密着的。他出進總是走側門，而那些貴客也都願意從側門出入的。除了初一，十五，朱大爺坐了藍呢大轎到城隍廟拈香，那兩扇烏漆的大門才曇花一現似的在轎子出進的時候，開閉一次。這是因為朱大爺做過一任什麽官，君子不忘其舊，城隍爺保佑他發了那末許多錢財，所以他忘不了初一，十五的拈香：而且要惟恭惟敬，從大門進出，這乘幸榮的遺物—藍呢大轎也不致於做了蠹魚的老家。</p>
<p>這四鄉一帶的種田人，有許多是朱大爺的佃戶，他們每年要到倉里（註一）還租，有些想從這條路子探問一些這兩扇烏黑大門以內的秘密的，但是朱大爺自己走的是側門，佃戶是祗有從後門出入了。朱大爺的宅子是全鎮婦孺皆知的十棣九天井，（註二）賬房設在最後一棣，佃戶們見到的是一所花園的後門，有一尺來長的鐵鎖把着：還有一連的五大倉間，有堆得和屋脊一樣高的米篾；還有：是賬房先生的一付城隍爺面孔了。（未完）</p>

<p>銅雷和軟脚兩位大將軍，你倆的大筆「的確」不錯，駡人的藝術，確乎也「嘸啥」，然而，我想你倆「吃了自己的飯，管人家的事」，恐怕確乎是不値得吧？依我看你倆都用不到像張飛一般地大喊着：「那個敢來和我鬥個一百合」，更用不着說什麽：「私生了」等的俗語，大家都像在「鴨子裏摸毛，象牙筷上尋絲」，歸根結底，仇愈結愈深，你攻我擊地，將來在播音界豈不又多了一個仇人嗎？然「二虎相打，必有一傷」。一個傷了，一個又難道就會多了幾塊肉嗎？好！我來想個「圓通辦法」吧！道：「不打不成朋友」，古人已和我們證實了，雖然你倆不是眞相打，然也差不多的，好了，我也不用多談了，諒來兩將軍一定會悟到的，不然，也要請倆將軍效效邶曾參的「三思而行一了！（醜女子）</p>
<p>軟脚和銅雷兩位仁兄大人的筆戰，真刀眞槍的，着　打了好幾個回合，其實兩位也太好勝了，銅雷兄也太吃飽了飯嘸哈做，偏偏要尋事，軟脚兄也不頤認錯，於是乎你一槍他一刀的大戰起來。據說軟脚兄是一個窮小于，靠着筆頭下一字一字　稿費來過活的，現在他還在編刊物，我想他當然很願意讓步。又聽說銅雷兄是蓬萊市塲四十八號××咖啡店小開，好在有吃有住，不妨管管閒事，脚兄，雷兄，你們說對嗎？（鐵筆）</p>
<p>銅雷與軟脚之戰，現在旣有和事老出來，我想雙方還是歇歇罷，事實終於會給你們證明的。（編者）</p>

<h3>Guangtian Will Explain to Envoy Jiang: Essential Points of Japan's Policy Towards China; Large Continuous Conference of Resident Generals in China; Representatives of the Military Department Convey Future Strategies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, it is rumored that Japan will establish a consolidated and unified diplomacy towards China. Foreign Minister Hirota will explain Japan's new policy towards China to our Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, before his departure from Tokyo on the 21st to return to China. Simultaneously, Foreign Minister Hirota has dispatched the Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau, Mr. Mamoru Shima, who arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 13th to meet with the Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Ariyoshi. It is said that the Japanese side's new policy towards China, which was previously rumored to be explained by Ariyoshi in Nanjing within days, will now be postponed, possibly until after Ambassador Jiang arrives in Shanghai on the 24th and meets with him, before he proceeds to Nanjing to meet with our diplomatic authorities. (Special Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Second Department Chief of the General Staff Headquarters, Okamura, and Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau, Shima, have been dispatched to Dalian and Shanghai to convey the fundamental points of the policy towards China established by the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, and Finance. On the 13th, Major General Okamura convened Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Itagaki; Commander of the North China Garrison Army, Tada; and Military Attaché to the Embassy, Isoya, at the Star House in Star Bay, Dalian, to convey certain fundamental points of the established policy towards China and to present the fundamental guidelines of the Army Central Department towards China. The Chief of Section Shima, who was dispatched to Shanghai, will also convey the basic outline of the policy towards China to Ambassador Ariyoshi, the heads of the embassy, and the Consuls General of Hankou (Miura), Guangdong (Kawai), Nanjing (Suma), and Shanghai (Ishi). He will explain the process of establishing the outline in detail, as well as the concrete direction of Foreign Minister Hirota's future active work towards China.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota will invite Ambassador Jiang Zuobin, who will soon attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the Fifth National Congress, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Minister will explain the outline of Japan's policy towards China, stating that Japan's goal is to enhance the welfare of East Asia, and especially where efforts are being made. He further hopes that Ambassador Jiang will convey this purpose to the Nanjing government party headquarters and to people of all walks of life in China, and to pay close attention to the reactions of people of all walks of life in China. (Telecommunications Agency Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A joint conference of representatives from the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Tianjin Garrison Army, and the General Staff Headquarters was held in Dalian yesterday and today. According to reports, after the conference, another meeting will be held in Changchun. After the meeting, Military Attaché to the Embassy, Isoya Renji, will convene a conference of Japanese military attachés stationed throughout China in Shanghai to report on the progress of this meeting and the methods for implementing the resolutions passed during the meeting. (Special Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) At the opening of the conference of staff officers from the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army of Japan today, Lieutenant General Okamura, Chief of the General Staff Headquarters of the Tokyo Army, delivered a speech urging everyone to unite and fulfill their duties, stating that Japanese soldiers must now understand and comprehend Tokyo's attitude. He then spoke of the opinions of the Japanese government on China and the overall world situation, paying particular attention to the Italo-Ethiopian War and its possible relationship to the Far East. Before the meeting, Okamura held talks with Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, presumably to seek understanding of the army's policies. At the same time, everyone noted the arrival of Japanese Navy Captain Honda today. After Honda arrived, he immediately consulted with Japanese naval personnel here. It is said that he will convene an important meeting of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai on October 20. Honda told news reporters that his visit to Dalian this time was to convey the opinions of the Japanese government, as there were many deficiencies in consultations by letters and telegrams.</p>
<h3>Main Figure of the Dalian Conference, Okamura, Makes a Statement; Shanghai Military Attaché Conference is Particularly Important</h3>
<p>A Dalian dispatch states that Major General Okamura Neiji, Chief of the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters, arrived in Dalian on the 12th morning accompanied by Staff Officer Kawamoto. According to his conversation with reporters on the ship, he said, "This conference is to transmit what the central government has already decided to the local areas. My task is to convey the atmosphere of the central government to the local areas and to make arrangements for business liaison. Because those in charge of dispatching responsibilities do not know about the various matters of the central government over a wide range, this is why this conference is being held. The conference to be held in Shanghai, because it involves all military attachés in China, may be even more important. The current situation in North China, the progress of Japan's economic work, still feels quite uneasy, which is a fact. How to correct it seems to be the matter of this conference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Ministry have also dispatched Mr. Shima and Mr. Honda to China. This can probably be seen as the fact that the policies towards China of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs, which used to be uncoordinated, are now unified."</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, arrived in Dalian by plane on the afternoon of the 12th to attend the military attaché conference. After waiting to enter the hotel, he immediately made a statement to reporters, saying, "This convocation is for listening to reports; there is nothing else to talk about. President Matsuoka may have individual meetings with the military attachés, but he will not attend the conference. The main thing at the conference will probably be Major General Okamura's speech, but if requested, the local situation may be explained."</p>
<h3>Matsudaira Will Inspect China Before Taking Office</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to England Matsudaira, at the earnest request of Foreign Minister Hirota, has decided to return to his post. However, before returning to his post, in order to inspect the development of "Manchukuo," he will, in early November, accompany Ambassador to Germany Mushakoji and stay in "Manchukuo" for two or three weeks, inspecting Changchun and Harbin and touring Beiping and Qingdao. Also, although the Disarmament Conference will be held within the year, other representatives will attend. Ambassador Matsudaira's return to his post is expected in January next year, traveling from Tokyo to London. (Telecommunications Agency Dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>High Winds and Waves; River Embankments Break; Everywhere Outside the Embankments of Shuyang is Water; Dyke on the West Bank of the Yanhai River to be Completed</h3>

<h3>The First Ten Days of the Italian Army's Invasion of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Italian army launched its invasion of Abyssinia on the 3rd of this month. Today marks the full ten days. This war was inevitable, as observers had anticipated. Therefore, its formal outbreak did not cause any shock in the international community. However, the scope of this war's involvement and its final outcome have caused great concern worldwide. In the past ten days, there has been no significant development in the war situation in East Africa. In the Mediterranean and in the League of Nations, although the atmosphere is serious, there are no signs of a major change. However, the anxiety in all aspects continues to increase. Now, let us take a look at the various situations in the past ten days to observe the impact and trend of this war.</p>
<p>The greatest impact of this war is the blow suffered by the League of Nations. The League of Nations, with the power of the General Assembly, could not resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. Now that the Italian army has launched an invasion of Abyssinia, although the League of Nations recognizes Italy as an aggressor based on the Covenant, it may in fact be unable to implement the sanctions it should have. Most of the League of Nations' recent activities have been promoted by the power of the United Kingdom. In fact, all the League of Nations can do is formal matters. Whether its resolutions can take effect depends on the use of the military and diplomatic power of the great powers. In imposing sanctions on Italy, the United Kingdom must obtain the firm support of France. However, the result of Italian diplomacy in Central Europe is that Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland refuse to implement common sanctions. The resolutions of the League of Nations have become useless documents. It is foreseeable that the power of the League of Nations in international mediation will become weaker in the future.</p>
<p>The impact of this war on the United Kingdom is also not small. The Mediterranean-Red Sea route is the lifeline of the British Empire. After the power of the German-Austrian alliance was dissolved, a new threat has now emerged. Italy's tough attitude towards the United Kingdom has made the United Kingdom realize the invisible backwardness of its naval and air forces. In the future, the distribution of the military power of the British Empire in the world will probably have a major change. The United Kingdom and the Mediterranean region are of course the main force. The power in the Far East will be weaker than before. This is the layout before the Great War in 1914. The difference is that at that time, the focus was on the North Sea, and the purpose was to counter Germany. In the future, the focus will be on the Mediterranean, and the purpose will be to counter Italy. However, there is a common point before and after, that is, a compromise with Japan on the ocean in the Far East. According to a Reuters dispatch from London the other day, former British Ambassador to Japan Lintley said in a speech that the United Kingdom should compromise with Japan and not "encourage" China. Such blatant remarks are noteworthy when they are discovered now. At the same time, the impact of this policy of the United Kingdom on the world, especially on the East, cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict now how far this war will develop. While launching an aggression, Italy is not breaking with the League of Nations. Its purpose seems to be to prepare for diplomatic negotiations after a considerable military victory. The United Kingdom is now promoting the sanctions of the League of Nations, applying indirect pressure on Italy, while quietly watching and avoiding formal conflict with Italy. Probably, if the Italian army's aggression does not make smooth progress, and France can fully support the United Kingdom's position, then the British attitude can be strengthened and more direct intervention can be carried out. According to the war situation in the past ten days, the Italian army is not very successful. If this war is to be delayed for how many days, it will cause other important changes. Italy cannot afford long-term military expenditures. The United Kingdom cannot tolerate a long-term threat to its main routes. At the same time, the two major groups of anti-status quo and maintaining the same status in Europe are gradually becoming distinct. Once the gunpowder line in East Africa is transmitted to the Mediterranean, the entire Europe is within the scope of the explosion.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot speculate too far now. Looking at the immediate aspects, Abyssinia's resistance to aggression has shown some success. This is an encouragement to the general small and weak nations, which cannot be ignored. Abyssinia, as a member of the League of Nations, should express considerable trust in the League of Nations within the possible scope. But it also knows that in order to maintain its own survival, it has to take full resistance to the aggressor. And this resistance is effective. Then, the East African war in the past ten days has already given the small and weak nations of the world a way to survive.</p>
<h3>Italian Army's Invasion of Abyssinia Advances Towards the Southeastern Border; Shibeli River Basin Suffers Tragic Bombing; Release of Poison Gas Causes Countless Deaths and Injuries to Humans and Animals; Abyssinian Army of 100,000 Digs Deep Trenches and Builds High Fortifications to Prepare for Battle</h3>
<p>Harar The Italian army's invasion of Abyssinia has today advanced to the Shibeli River basin in the southeastern part of Abyssinia. RShibeli bombed various villages there, and isolated Abyssinian army outposts, preparing to penetrate deeply in a major operation. The Abyssinian side has also concentrated 100,000 troops to prepare for resistance. The battle site will be on the slopes of the Wagaden Plateau, south of Qiqiqa. If Harar falls, the Italian army plans to go straight to Diridawa, cutting off the railway, and conquering Abyssinia by economic warfare. It is learned here that the Italian army's bombing in the Shibeli River basin has destroyed many villages, and has resulted in countless casualties to women and children. Refugees claim that the Italian army used poison gas, resulting in the complete destruction of humans and animals. At the same time, the Abyssinian army's front lines are also digging deep trenches and building high fortifications in preparation for a desperate resistance. (Guomin Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa It is received here today that 11 Italian aircraft dropped countless bombs in the sky over Gerogubi in Wagaden Province to bomb the Abyssinian army's positions, causing great losses. Thirty-six Abyssinian soldiers hid in a cellar, and the bomb sank the cellar, causing all 36 people to be buried alive. Italian aircraft also bombed many villages in the Danakil region near the northeastern border of Abyssinia. It is heard that there were many casualties among the residents. (Reuters Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news obtained by the local newspapers, the Italian army has continued to move on the entire line in East Africa. Italian troops have continued their search in Somalia territory, and aircraft have flown to Bagerli Fortress near the Shibeli River in Abyssinia and bombed it for 40 minutes. Abyssinian chieftains in Tigray Province continue to surrender, and most tribes have also surrendered upon hearing the news. The troops led by General Sandeni, who captured the city of Hodeida, are now continuing to advance towards the eastern part of Tigray Province. According to Italian sources in Djibouti (French Somaliland), Italy is departing from Assab (in Italian Eritrea) and is advancing towards the eastern part of Abyssinia, now no more than 80 kilometers from Harar Province, which is defended by Abyssinian General Nasibu. (Havas Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>Asmara Abyssinian tribal leader Guf Chai recently fled to the Italian army. According to soldiers who fled with him, the traffic between Magal and Abyssinia has now been completely cut off. The city is believed to be the second major objective of the Italian army on the northern road, 65 miles southeast of Adua. The Italian army's northern front extends from a certain location 12 miles east of Adigrat to 8 miles north of Aksum, with a total of 60,000 troops. The Italian army is still transporting soldiers and war equipment as quickly as possible to its weak points. Soldiers on the front lines are still engaged in clearing the countryside to search for General Seyoum, the governor of the Tigray region who is hiding. The Italian army now hopes that Gugsa will surrender his people. (Reuters Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Italian Imitation: Plotting to Establish a Puppet New Nation. Descendants of the Former Abyssinian Royal Family are Induced to Betray. Major Obstacle Removed for the Italian Army's Southern Advance from the North.</h3>
<p>Aksimala. According to a report from our correspondent with the army, Baer, Gefchai, a descendant of the former Abyssinian royal family, has surrendered to the Italian army. Fifteen hundred of his soldiers advanced to the Italian front line, placing their guns and swords before General Tabono, a high-ranking commissioner. They shook hands and made merry with Italian soldiers outside the camp. The Italian High Command considers this an omen of military victory. Abyssinian soldiers in Tigray Province are surrendering in droves upon hearing the news. The city of Aksum has not been occupied by the Italian army but has already raised a white flag. The area around Magale is now completely under Italian control. Based on observations here, the entire Tigray Province will soon be under Italian control. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official circles today openly stated that Mussolini plans to establish a new nation in at least a portion of Abyssinia, with Gefchai, the former governor of Tigray Province who recently surrendered to the Italian army with 13,000 men, as its puppet emperor. Gefchai is not related to the Abyssinian King by blood but claims to be a descendant of John IV, who ruled Abyssinia from 1872 to 1889. It is said that other important chiefs not of the Ansari tribe will soon surrender to Italy. If so, Italy will be able to control all of Abyssinia's coastal areas. The "Public Opinion" newspaper today has a headline stating, "The Legitimate Heir to the Throne Has Betrayed the Usurper in the Abyssinian Capital." The newspaper also detailed the Abyssinian royal family's lineage, claiming that Gefchai is a direct descendant of the New Solomon dynasty, while former King Menelik and current King Haile Selassie are both usurpers. It is generally believed that Gefchai's surrender will allow the Italian army to take Magale without firing a shot. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Italian "Italian-Japanese Daily" recently commented on the surrender of Gefchai, a descendant of the old Abyssinian royal family, stating that when King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy inspected Eritrea in 1932, he met with various chiefs of Tigray Province, including Gefchai. At that time, this person requested preferential treatment from Italy and expressed his willingness to submit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(New York) Today's most important war news is the defection of Abyssinian chief Gefchai on the Eritrean border. Gefchai has always been disobedient to the Abyssinian King. With his cooperation, the Italian army's southward advance to cut off the Ginji railway will face no major obstacles. If other chiefs follow suit, the Italian army can encircle the Abyssinian capital from the east, west, and south. Italian military personnel have been trying to induce these chiefs to surrender for months, using power and wealth as bait to make them rebel against the Abyssinian King. If Italy can induce more tribes to surrender, the time required to conquer Abyssinia can be greatly reduced, and Geneva's impatience may also arise from this. If Mussolini can occupy Abyssinia as soon as possible, the League of Nations will again have to deal with a "fait accompli." Observers believe that Britain is now in a dilemma because, on the one hand, it does not want war, and on the other hand, it cannot bear to watch the League of Nations disintegrate. Therefore, Britain's concentration of its fleet in the Mediterranean is enough to indicate that if it must engage in a war, it will strike a decisive blow. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in East Africa Accepts the City of Aduwa and Presides Over the Unveiling Ceremony of the Monument</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. A telegram from Baer, our correspondent with the army, states that General Tabono, the High Commissioner of East Africa, will formally accept the city of Aduwa in the name of Italy today. All streets in the city are decorated with flowers and colored ribbons, and many triumphal arches have been erected in preparation for the welcome. General Tabono departed from the city of Koati yesterday afternoon to inspect the battlefield of 1896 (i.e., the battle in which the Italian army suffered a previous defeat) and the initial contact points at the beginning of this war, such as the Darotaikel Pass, 20 kilometers north of Aduwa. After arriving here today, he will participate in the religious ceremony held at the Koptope Church and then preside over the unveiling ceremony of the monument, which commemorates the soldiers who died in 1896. The monument is engraved with the words "The Revenge for the Soldiers Who Died in the Battle of Aduwa Has Been Avenged." After the ceremony, local chiefs will offer congratulations to General Tabono. General Tabono plans to spend the entire day on Monday studying the spiritual and material lives of the residents, as well as the local administrative and legal organization. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Tabono, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in East Africa, will formally enter the city of Aduwa tomorrow to take over the occupied territory. The General will hold the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the Italian soldiers who died in Aduwa in 1896 and will also be in charge of the local civil administration. The monument is a marble pillar, engraved with the phrase "October 6, 1935, the 13th year of Fascist rule, Revenge for the Soldiers Who Died in Aduwa." After the unveiling ceremony, the General will review the Second Army Corps that conquered Aduwa. (Reuters telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Italian Army Continues to Advance in East Africa: Reservists of the 1914 Class Remain in Service</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has recently announced an order establishing a Higher Academy of Naval Studies. The steamer "Toskano," carrying 20 officers, 320 soldiers, and some Asgari indigenous soldiers, set sail from Naples today for Messina, where it will embark 200 soldiers of the "Sila" division and depart for East Africa. Another steamer, "Piemonte," carrying 105 officers and 2,691 soldiers, set sail from Messina for the port of Massawa in East Africa. Local officials and residents went to the pier to see them off. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the Italian government ordered reservists of the 1914 class who have completed or are about to complete their military service to remain in service pending further orders. This proves that Italy will likely not allow conscripts to be discharged while the war with Abyssinia is not yet over. (Reuters telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Government Forces the Italian Ambassador to Leave the Country: A Special Train is Prepared to Compel His Departure</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. The government is still forcing Count Vinci, the Italian Ambassador to Abyssinia, to leave the country. If he refuses again, he will be forcibly sent on his way. According to reports, the special train prepared for him by the authorities is scheduled to depart for Djibouti at 10 a.m. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. Italian Ambassador Count Vinci and Lieutenant Colonel Gartliani of the Army Committee are confined to the embassy, claiming that they are unwilling to leave the embassy until all Italian consuls in Abyssinia have safely departed. This afternoon, they both "capitulated" and were escorted by Abyssinian soldiers to a fortified area five miles from the Abyssinian capital, led by local leader Taistai. Although the two will be "guests" of the Abyssinian government, they have actually been detained. After "capitulating" today, the Italian Ambassador declared that he voluntarily remained in the Abyssinian capital to await the safe arrival of all Italian consular officials from Magaro. Then he would obey the Abyssinian government's disposal. Soon after, the Abyssinian King ordered the Ambassador and Lieutenant Colonel Gartlini to be escorted to the fortified area led by Taistai. At the same time, the remaining personnel of the Italian embassy have already taken a special train to Djibouti. The soldiers guarding the Italian embassy today were all carefully selected from the army by the authorities and swore allegiance before the Abyssinian King to show their prudence. (Reuters telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. According to a report from our correspondent, Auchana, when the Italian embassy staff left Abyssinia on a special train yesterday, Second Secretary Deglena also left the station because Ambassador Count Vinci refused to depart. He was chased back by the police, who seized his pistol and pushed him onto the first train. Currently, the Abyssinian government no longer recognizes Count Vinci as the Italian Ambassador. Vinci informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he wished to stay in the Abyssinian capital, accompanied by Army Counselor Colonel Gadlini, until the Italian Consul in Magalo arrives in the capital. Only force can make him submit. Yesterday, it was rumored that Count Vinci had fled somewhere, but this was found to be untrue. He is currently residing in the embassy. The Abyssinian government prohibits unauthorized personnel from entering or leaving the embassy. Only the French Vice-Consul, Temulier, is allowed to maintain contact with the Italian embassy on behalf of the diplomatic corps and to enter and leave freely. There are still several soldiers guarding the front of the embassy. A British news reporter attempted to climb over the wall to enter and investigate but was spotted by the guards, arrested, and mistreated. He was released only after receiving an imperial edict.

<h3>The Abyssinian Army is Fully Deployed to the Front Lines: The Last Batch of 10,000 Men is Reviewed by the King. The Two Sons of the Abyssinian Ambassador to the UK Return Home to Serve</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital. Our special correspondent, Auchana, declared that 10,000 Abyssinian soldiers were reviewed by the King in front of the palace yesterday. They then marched in formation through the streets, singing war songs. Previously, the Abyssinian King issued a general mobilization order, ordering all conscripts nationwide to enlist before October 12. Those reviewed yesterday were the last batch. Many troops have been sent to the front lines in recent days, and the capital has become deserted. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The eldest son of Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian Ambassador to the UK, 23 years old, and the second son, 22 years old, are scheduled to return home on Tuesday to rush to the front lines and join the air force. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Committee Discusses Sanctions Against Italy: Eden Asks Member States to Boycott Italian Goods. French Experts Do Not Advocate Overly Harsh Measures</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Seventeen to discuss economic sanctions against Italy, British representative Eden urged member states to implement a ban on Italian exports as the third type of sanction against Italy, stating that League of Nations member states purchase 70% of Italy's total exports. If these sales are cut off, the effect will be significant. If League of Nations member states further ban the export of certain major products to Italy, the effect will be even greater. This ban will undoubtedly cause inconvenience to League of Nations member states, but it can be reduced through mutual assistance. Economic pressure can also be implemented by stopping the supply of food necessary for Italy to wage war, but this must be done with caution and will take a longer period of time to achieve. Eden also urged the prompt implementation of various effective sanctions. French technical experts supported Eden's view on banning goods from entering and exiting Italy, but said that while the opportunity for reconciliation has not been completely lost, sanctions should not be overly harsh and suggested that the Committee of Seventeen should currently focus on banning the transport of major products to Italy. Romanian representative, Foreign Minister Titulescu, suggested that it is now appropriate to examine how to reduce the economic losses suffered by the countries boycotting Italy. Representatives from South Africa, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Little Entente all enthusiastically supported Eden's points of view. It is now hoped that when the Committee of Seventeen reconvenes on Monday, the recommendations made by Eden can be fully discussed. Yesterday, all three subcommittees held discussions on the implementation of sanctions against Italy. The financial subcommittee's proposal to halt all financial and commercial lending activities to Italy seems to have little practical relevance because lending transactions have already ceased since the Italian government implemented currency control regulations. The Third Committee is currently discussing whether other items can be added to the list of prohibited war materials being transported to Italy. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Russian Representative Suggests Restraining Those Who Hinder Sanctions</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 17-nation subcommittee of the Sanctions Plan Adjustment Committee recently held a meeting to discuss various measures to enable non-member countries to economically cooperate in suppressing Italy, but no decision was taken. Soviet representative Potemkin advocated imposing financial and economic restraints on countries that refuse to implement Article 16 of the Covenant, namely: (1) The debt that these countries can raise shall not exceed their usual needs. (2) The exports of these countries shall not exceed the amount of previous years. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union's proposal is aimed at Austria, Hungary, and Albania. Other non-member countries that hinder sanctions are also included. British representative Eden put forward the following suggestions: (1) All member states of the League of Nations should refuse to import Italian goods. This measure could affect 70% of Italy's exports. (2) Raw materials and products that can be used for war industries should be prohibited from being transported to Italy. In addition, he proposed that each member state quickly compile a list of goods being transported to Italy and submit it to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations so that a detailed list can be prepared.

<h3>Mexico Joins the 16-Nation Subcommittee</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Because Mexico has a large oil production capacity, the Sanctions Plan Adjustment Committee recently elected a representative from that country to join the 16-nation subcommittee, becoming the 17-nation subcommittee. The Financial Issues Subcommittee organized by the subcommittee (consisting of the UK, France, Greece, South Africa, the Netherlands, Poland, and Romania) elected former Greek Foreign Minister and honorary governor of the National Bank, Maximus, as chairman. Other national representatives include the British Undersecretary of the Treasury, Hordley, the Polish economic advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wiczlacki, and the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Titulescu.

<h3>Austria's Position: Unwilling to Sell Out a Friend</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The semi-official political news agency recently explained that Austria is a loyal member of the League of Nations, but the measures taken by the League of Nations have the nature of punishing a great power, and this great power, in Austria's most difficult and challenging times, held a firm and unwavering attitude and provided Austria with effective assistance. Even in the most superficial terms of loyalty, Austria has to make some reservations. If Austria were to repay the most valuable and sometimes most practical assistance with malice, it would inevitably lose the sympathy of the world, including the British people. In particular, Britain values reputation the most; would it want to see Austria sell out a friend? (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>The Second International Supports the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Brussels. The Second International recently held a meeting here to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. It passed a resolution stating that it was satisfied with the League of Nations designating Italy as an aggressor, and stated, "The Second International will certainly provide practical assistance to any sanctions that the League of Nations may decide on with the aim of stopping the war between Italy and Abyssinia and quickly restoring peace. This is what the Second International can guarantee to the League of Nations." The resolution also requested the League of Nations to decide on sanctions and implement them in a short time, so that the Italian government would realize that the results that it can obtain through acts of aggression are no greater than those that it can obtain without engaging in war. After the resolution was passed, the representatives unanimously decided to telegraph a summary to the President of the League of Nations General Assembly, Czech Foreign Minister Benes.

<h3>Britain Induces Cuba to Participate in Sanctions</h3>
<p>Havana. The British Ambassador to Cuba recently met with Secretary of State Bauerney and indicated to him in a semi-official manner that if the Cuban government can support the attitude held by Britain in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, then Britain will assist Cuba in commerce as an exchange. Bauerney replied, "Cuba will take the attitude of the majority of the League of Nations as its attitude," but declined to explain the country's implementation of sanctions against Italy in the future.

<h3>Germany Takes a Reserved Attitude: Implementing Economic Blockades Will Cause Great Losses to Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo reported that German personnel in Geneva issued a statement last night stating that the German government does not intend to decide on any position regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Neither the League of Nations nor Britain invited Germany to participate in the Sanctions Plan Adjustment Committee. It said, "Germany will adopt a reserved attitude. It will separately study any sanctions that the Adjustment Committee may recommend after they are announced." The "Business Daily" stated that according to information obtained by a correspondent in Geneva for the Austrian semi-official "Federal Post," Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is about to put forward three suggestions in the hopes of resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute: (1) The Italian government will be entrusted with ruling the three Abyssinian provinces of Harare, Hargaden, and Tigray. (2) Italy will undertake not to attack the Abyssinian capital with aircraft. (3) Peace negotiations will be held through the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Evening News recently published a long article explaining that countries participating in sanctions will suffer significant sacrifices. It stated, "We know the meaning of an economic blockade very well. (Note: Germany was subject to an economic blockade during the European War.) The sacrifices suffered by a country fighting to maintain its right to survival due to economic starvation are extremely significant. Italy's needs for coal, timber, oil, rubber, and various minerals are almost entirely dependent on foreign countries. In addition, Italy's exports have recently decreased significantly. The number of foreign tourists visiting Italy has also decreased. All of these factors are enough to prove the difficulty of Italy's position. However, if other countries impose economic sanctions on Italy, then they themselves will inevitably feel a great loss. Taking Yugoslavia as an example, its exports to Italy account for about 20% of its total exports. Romania exports a large amount of oil to Italy. Once sanctions are implemented, these countries will inevitably be the first to feel the impact." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Fascists and Opponents Fight Fiercely in New York: Clubs and Glass Bottles Fly, Leaving Many Injured with Broken Heads and Bloodshed</h3>
<p>(New York) Thousands of fascists and anti-fascists fought fiercely this morning, using clubs and glass bottles as weapons. When mounted patrols arrived to suppress them, many people had broken heads and were bleeding. Today is Columbus Day, and there is usually a celebration ceremony in Times Square. When Mayor Chardia and Governor Limen finished their ceremony and left the venue, the riot suddenly broke out. Both sides punched each other, and glass bottles flew in the air. Large teams of mounted patrols were quickly called to the scene to suppress the violence, but many people were already injured. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Amidst the Italo-Abyssinian War, American Prices Skyrocket: Industry and Commerce are Poised for Huge Profits</h3>
<p>(New York) The most important factor in the US economic situation this week is the danger of credit inflation. Gay, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, expressed his opinion on Wednesday that if the government does not stop it soon, the stock market may experience a dangerous surge. The new chairman of the Federal Trade Safety Commission, Landis, said that the commission does not have the necessary power to stop the surge in market prices, and the government does not intend to take other measures to control the activities of the exchange beyond those that have already been implemented. After the above statement was released, the prices of various unstable securities on the exchange were stimulated and rose sharply. In view of this, the government did not include raw materials in the list of goods prohibited from being transported to warring countries. The market prices of various raw materials subsequently rose, reaching heights not seen since May 1930. In addition, the general trend in various industries is generally good, which is also one of the reasons for the rise in raw material prices. Because the American people believe that the Italo-Abyssinian war will be limited in scope and will not expand, American industry and commerce can reap huge profits. In short, the general economic situation in the United States is similar to that in mid-August, with the only difference being that the activity in heavy industry has slightly decreased.

The Ministry of Colonial Affairs will contribute a phosphate ore area (which can produce 60,000 tons of phosphate ore per year). (Japan United Press telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>US and Japan Reach a Gentleman's Agreement: Restricting Japanese Cotton Fabric Imports to the Philippines, Conditioned on the Philippines Not Increasing Tax Rates</h3>
<p>(Washington) Negotiations between the United States and Japan on the issue of restricting Japanese cotton fabric exports to the Philippines have been ongoing for a long time. Recently, a gentleman's agreement was reached, stipulating that from September 1 of this year, Japanese cotton fabric exports to the Philippines shall not exceed 45 million square meters per year. In the past twelve months, the total amount of foreign cotton fabric imported by the Philippines was 95 million square meters, of which 60 million square meters were imported from Japan. The current agreement limits this to no more than 45 million square meters. In addition, State Department officials also plan to restrict the import of Japanese cotton fabric into the United States in the same way as the Philippines, and are currently studying it. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was announced here today that Japanese exporters have agreed to limit sales of cotton fabrics to the Philippines to 45 million square meters per year for two years, starting from August 1 of this year, on the condition that the Philippines does not increase tax rates. In 1934, Japan's sales of cotton fabrics in the Philippines reached 56,356,000 square meters. State Department officials stated today that after careful consideration, they believe that this limit will benefit the cotton fabric industries of both the United States and Japan and will not harm the interests of the Philippine people or impose any responsibility on the Philippine government. It is said that "the governments of the United States and Japan have completely agreed that this approach can avoid increasing conflicts between the two countries' business communities due to excessive competition and can solve economic difficulties and protect legitimate interests." The agreement also stipulates that the limit can be reduced by up to 10% in any one of the two years and transferred to the limit of another year, but it may not exceed 26 million square meters in any six months. The State Department stated that if calculated by value, the United States' cotton fabric exports to the Philippines under the new agreement will be about double that of Japan. In the first eight months of this year, Japanese cotton fabrics accounted for 57.7% of the entire Philippine market, while American goods accounted for only 37.7%. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>日偽軍挑釁　侵入俄境開槍射擊　蘇聯向日嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to today's Manchurian news, a small detachment of Japanese-Manchu soldiers, totaling fifty men, crossed the Russian border near Grodekovo, not far from Khabarovsk, and opened fire on Russian border guards. The Russian soldiers returned fire, reportedly resulting in several casualties. According to the government news agency, the Soviet Russian government has instructed its ambassador in Tokyo to lodge a firm protest with the Japanese authorities. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The government formally announced today that Soviet Russian and Japanese troops had engaged in clashes on the Manchurian border in recent days, resulting in casualties on both sides. It is claimed that on October 6, 8, and 12, Japanese troops had violated the Soviet Russian border, leading to exchanges of rifle and machine-gun fire. The Soviet Russian government has lodged a protest with the Japanese government and proposed the dispatch of investigators to clarify the facts of the conflict. (Guomin News Agency, October 13)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border commission, Mr. Nishi Haruhiko, Chief of the First Section of the European and Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who had been in Manchuria for about a month to ascertain the views of the Kwantung authorities and investigate the actual situation on the ground, returned to Tokyo on the 11th. Yesterday, he reported everything to Foreign Minister Hirota and Director-General Togo of the European and Asian Bureau and held lengthy discussions. As a result, "Manchukuo" has adopted an opposing attitude towards establishing the commission, arguing that it is premature. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to hold a conference of the three ministries—Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy—next week, focusing on Mr. Nishi's report, to study the matter further. The Foreign Minister will then convey "Manchukuo's" views to the Russian Ambassador. Consequently, pessimistic sentiment surrounding this matter is quite strong. (Dentsu News Agency, October 13)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a public telegram from Ambassador Ota to the Soviet Union addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Counselor Sakako and Far Eastern Minister Kazinovsky held negotiations on the revision of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty on the 10th, but there was no progress.

<h3>波瀾新閣成立　前內障任總揆</h3>
<h3>New Cabinet Formed in Poland; Former Minister of Interior Appointed Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Following the resignation of the Sławek cabinet yesterday morning, President Mościcki entrusted the task of forming a new cabinet to the outgoing Minister of Interior, Gościarz Wóycicki. The cabinet has now been announced as established. Apart from the changes in the ministers of Finance, Commerce, Interior, Education, and Public Welfare, the remaining ministers have been retained from the previous cabinet. These include Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Kwiatkowski, Minister of Commerce, General Gorecki (formerly the President of the National Bank), and Minister of Interior, Raczkiewicz. The newly appointed Prime Minister, Gościarz Wóycicki, is a native of Vilnius, 43 years old, and one of the young colonels of Poland. He participated in the Polish independence movement and joined the famous "Revival Corps" organized by the late General Piłsudski. In 1918, when the Polish independence army entered Warsaw and disarmed the German garrison in the city, Gościarz Wóycicki played a significant role. From then on, he gradually rose to prominence. In 1920, during the war between Poland and the Soviet Bolshevik Party, Gościarz Wóycicki distinguished himself even further. In 1922, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives, originally belonging to the left wing of the Peasant Party. (Havas News Agency, October 13)</p>

<h3>美參院調查委會　研究購銀政策　主張白銀恢復本位　俾於對華貿易有利</h3>
<h3>U.S. Senate Investigating Committee Studies Silver Purchase Policy; Advocates Restoring Silver Standard to Benefit Trade with China</h3>
<p>Salt Lake City, USA: The Senate Committee Investigating Government Silver Purchase Plans today studied the impact of silver purchase policies on import and export industries. Those present included Senators Pittman, Borah, King, William, Thomas, as well as the Secretary of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Hyde, and the Director of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Department of Commerce, Jones. The committee reported on U.S.-China trade. It is said that Senators Thomas and Borah both advocated for immediately restoring silver as the U.S. currency standard at a price of $1.29 per ounce. Senators Pittman and King, however, expressed satisfaction with the current plan. Senator Thomas strongly asserted that silver should be restored as the standard currency while Congress still has the power to do so, fearing that a change in government might lead to the abandonment of the silver policy. Senator Thomas also stated that if silver is not a fundamental monetary metal, it is merely a token. As for China, after the rise in silver prices, it has been able to purchase more foreign goods without harming Chinese commerce. Foreign investors in China only see that rising wages and prices will reduce their profits. Foreign banks also oppose the rise in silver prices because it will reduce the value of their Chinese securities holdings. However, Americans, when considering the interests of others, should first protect American interests. Senators Borah, Pittman, and King made no statements. Senator King only mentioned that the results of the investigation would be published next January. (Guomin News Agency, October 12)</p>
<h3>蘇聯海軍勢力　軍事費膨脹積極造艦</h3>
<h3>Expansion of Soviet Naval Power; Military Spending Soars as Shipbuilding Accelerates</h3>
<p>Hua News Agency Report: As international tensions intensify, and in conjunction with the progress of the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan, the combat power of the Soviet Red Fleet is also increasing. In particular, considering the large expansion of Soviet military spending, although the budget for the previous year was 1.65 billion rubles, the actual expenditure was 5 billion rubles. This year's figure has reached 6.5 billion rubles. Consequently, the number of warships newly built within the scope of naval power is also substantial.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zhicheng, the director of the Lushan Administration, came to Nanjing on the 13th and will meet with President Wang in the coming days to report on the progress of the draft agreement for reclaiming the British Concession in Lushan. He received a telegram from Lushan urging him to return to Lushan immediately. Mr. Jiang is scheduled to fly to Xunyang on the 14th morning and then to Lushan. After the matter is completed, he will return. Mr. Jiang stated that after the Lushan Concession is reclaimed, it is planned to be turned into a national park. It is also learned that the issue of reclaiming the concession in Lushan, under the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was negotiated by Jiang Zhicheng and the British Consul-General in Hankou, Mershon, over a period of 14 months, resulting in a draft agreement last month. The content of the agreement stipulates that all concession areas will be unconditionally returned to China. The ownership of the land originally belongs to China, and any fixtures that were originally owned by the concession authorities will also be taken over by the Chinese side. Currently, both the Chinese and British sides have hired accountants to audit the assets of the British in the concession and will jointly audit them on the 20th of this month, which is expected to be completed in three or four days. This will facilitate the future payment of house taxes and land rents by British nationals. Both sides will sign the agreement in Lushan around the 25th, with Mershon representing the British side and Jiang Zhicheng representing the Chinese side. After the agreement is signed, an advisory committee will be formed, whose nature is only advisory. There will be four Chinese members and three British members. The term of this committee is seven years. The Administration will be responsible for all administrative matters, and the advisory committee cannot interfere. The organization of the Administration will consist of three sections and will not be expanded. For important design projects, personnel will be transferred from central, provincial, and municipal agencies. All persons residing in Lushan in the future must comply with all Chinese laws and pay house taxes and land rents. If they fail to pay for two full years, their property will be unconditionally taken over as public property. However, those who return to their home country may pay five years of house taxes and land rents in advance, otherwise, they will be treated in the same way. (Special Dispatch, October 13)</p>

<h3>Xigong Banner Dispute, Compromise Solution Agreed Upon, Awaiting He Jingwu to Go North to Handle, Mongolian Political Council Will Also Submit for Discussion</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the Xigong Banner dispute between Mongolia and Suiyuan, although it has once entered a serious situation, the path to a peaceful resolution seems not to have been cut off, due to the belief on both sides of "not making things worse". The third plenary session of the Mongolian Political Council opened on the 9th of this month. Because the commissioners were not all present, the discussion was postponed. However, on the future meeting, there will inevitably be important resolutions on the Xigong Banner issue. What extent will the future development be, is worthy of attention. The key to resolving this issue is no longer in the Suiyuan and Mongolia sides themselves, but in how the central government handles it. When the news of the central government sending senior officials north to thoroughly investigate the case reached them a month ago, the Mongolian side informally expressed the hope that the central government would appoint trusted Mongols to serve, otherwise it would only complicate the situation. Its meaning is nothing more than rejecting consultants related to Suiyuan officials in this matter. As for the inside story of the case, both Mongolia and Suiyuan have issued telegrams. Oqiguang, deputy director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Beiping, once ran around to mediate, but the result was nothing. Recently, since the central government decided to send He Jingwu to take charge of handling this matter, in addition to preparing to make a resolution at the third plenary session, the Mongolian side also seems to be eager for the central government to quickly mediate, so there are several people mediating everything between Suiyuan and Bailingmiao so that He Jingwu can smoothly resolve it when he goes north for a thorough investigation. The final compromise solution is estimated to be (1) the Beizi title of Shi Wang will still be retained, (2) the Zhasake position of Xigong Banner will be entrusted to someone else. The Mongolian side has agreed to accept it, and the transfer of personnel is currently soliciting opinions from the Suiyuan side. According to the Suiyuan authorities, all measures taken by the province against Mongolia completely comply with the orders of Taiyuan, so it is necessary to convey the opinions of the Shanxi provincial authorities. As far as the current situation is concerned, if the Shanxi provincial authorities can handle this compromise solution accommodatingly, then the Xigong Banner dispute can be said to have no problems. Once He Jingwu comes north to handle the legal procedures, Lang can completely resolve it. According to this, a telegram from Beijing recently stated that He Jingwu's trip north has been delayed due to illness. However, if the mediation of the Xigong Banner case is smooth, and both Mongolia and Suiyuan can accept the method of transfer, then He is also willing to travel with illness. Wu Heling, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, arrived in Beiping from Beijing yesterday (October 10th) to attend the third plenary session of the Mongolian Political Council. According to his statement to others, the Xigong Banner dispute is not difficult to resolve, but how to eliminate the gap between Suiyuan and Mongolia after the resolution, he is very willing to discuss at length. Wu made great efforts to mediate the issue of the Suiyuan Mongolia special tax in the previous time. Therefore, this trip to Bailingmiao will also engage in mediation in a personal capacity.

<h3>Hebei Province, River Defense Faces Major Danger, Lengzhai and Other Places above Liuzhuang May Breach, Jiangsu and Shandong Will Still Be Affected If It Breaches Again</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Dongzhuang breach blocking project on the Yellow River in Shandong Province has been implemented on schedule. Unexpectedly, alarming news came that Lengzhai in Hebei Province was facing a major danger due to changes in the river's course, and the situation was serious, and it was feared that it would follow in Dongzhuang's footsteps, which is quite alarming. The reason is that Lengzhai, more than ten miles above Liuzhuang in Hebei Province, is about fifty or sixty miles away from Dongzhuang in Shandong. Recently, because the Yellow River's course has been raised, the main stream directly hits the south bank embankment. The second section of the south bank, up to Tianhezui, is about three kilometers long. On the 11th of this month, it breached towards the trench. The upper part of the fourth section to Xiaolengzhai is more than one kilometer long, and the river beach continues to collapse. The dam in the area is thin and the soil is loose, and the water surface is two meters higher than the ground. By the 12th, the river beach at Tianhezui had been washed away by thirteen or fourteen meters and is still collapsing. The willow bottom brick dam between the sections of Xiaolengzhai in the fourth section of the south bank has come into contact with the side stream, and the critical situation has reached its peak. There is a shortage of funds and materials, and it is feared that it will not be preserved. Qi Shouan, Director of the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau, has been on the job supervising and rushing for seven days, and the situation has not improved. Chen Yasan, the magistrate of Shan County in Heze, also rushed to the site for inspection on the 11th. Because of the critical situation, if measures are not taken quickly, not only will Hebei Province be unfavorable, but Shandong and Jiangsu will also be affected. Qi Shouan asked Chen Yasan for assistance due to the shortage of funds and materials. Chen has already sent a telegram to Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and also telegraphed the Breach Blocking Association and the River Affairs Bureau for a report, requesting instructions on everything, and requesting the Hebei Provincial Government to take measures quickly. After receiving the report, the provincial government has approved it and sent a telegram to Shang Zhen, Chairman of Hebei Province.</p>
<h3>Yuehan Railway, Zhushao Project Progresses, Most of the Entire Project is Completed, Pingle Section Opened to Traffic at the End of Last Month</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Except for the southern section of the Yuehan Railway from Guangzhou to Shaozhou and the northern section from Changsha to Hankou, which have already been opened to traffic, only the Zhushao section has not been fully laid. Therefore, the construction of this section is actively underway. The Zhushao Road project is divided into three small sections: the section in Guangdong Province is from Lechang to Pingshi, the section in Hunan Province is from Leiyang to Hengzhou, and the section from Hengzhou via Zhuting to Zhuzhou. Most of the entire project from Lechang to Zhuzhou has been completed. Earth and stone works have been completed by 89%, tunnels have been completed by 80%, large bridges have been completed by 64%, small bridges and culverts have been completed by 83%, and track laying accounts for 44% (177.6 kilometers have been laid). It is expected that the Zhushao Road will be fully opened to traffic by the end of next year. As for the small section from Lechang to Pingshi, it started operating on September 20, officially selling tickets, and passenger and freight traffic is quite prosperous. The train times and fares for this section have been stipulated as follows: The train departs from Lechang at 7:00 a.m., arrives at Qimen Station at 8:28 a.m., and the fare is 40 cents (calculated temporarily at third class). It departs from Qimen at 8:38 a.m., arrives at Luojiadu Station at 10:00 a.m., and the fare is 80 cents. It departs from Luojiadu at 10:05 a.m., arrives at Pingshi at 10:32 a.m., and the fare is 95 cents. The train returns from Pingshi to Lechang, departing at 3:30 p.m., arriving at Luojiadu at 3:57 p.m., departing from Luojiadu at 4:02 p.m., arriving at Qimen at 5:24 p.m., departing from Qimen at 5:34 p.m., and arriving at Lechang at 7:02 p.m. The departure times of each station are connected with the Guangshao section of the Yuehan South Road. The joint transportation between the Guangshao section and the Leping section was scheduled to be implemented on the Double Tenth Festival. Agreements have been made on joint transportation regulations and passenger and freight fares. After the implementation of joint transportation between the two sections, passengers and goods can go directly from Guangzhou to Pingshi, in other words, directly to the border of Hunan, which is more convenient for transportation between Guangdong and Hunan provinces than before. As for Hengzhou Station in Hunan Province, it is the center of the Zhushao section and a second-class large station of the Yuehan Railway. The station was built in April 1934 and completed in August of this year. The Zhushao Road Bureau has already moved in to work. The surrounding venues, roads, vendor shops, and staff residences are being completed in order. Therefore, the road bureau also held the official opening ceremony of Hengzhou Station on the Double Tenth Festival. (October 9th)</p>
<h3>Suijing Department of the Third District of Fujian Arrests the Chen Weijin Faction, Chen Organizes the Black-Clad Gang Throughout Several Counties</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: This time, the Fujian Provincial Government and the Suijing Department recruited all the local armies in the province without restrictions and forgave the past. However, the bandits who refuse to be recruited and continue to do evil will be thoroughly suppressed. Chen Weijin, a notorious bandit from Quanzhou and a former subordinate of Chen Guohui, a native of Matou, Nan'an, was the only one who refused to be recruited. He nominally disbanded his bandit troops, collected his firearms, and organized the so-called "Black-Clad Gang". Taking Chen's hometown of Matou District in Nan'an as the center, he recruited local soldiers, disbanded bandits, hooligans, and academic scum into the party. The party members were densely distributed in several counties of Nan'an, Yongchun, and Anxi, with great momentum. Chen Weijin himself claimed to go to Tokyo, Japan, to study this spring, but left his confidant Chen Shijin in Nan'an to preside over the work and still be directed by Chen Weijin, burying military fire and secretly transporting weapons and ammunition, plotting wrongdoing. The Suijing Department, upon receiving the report, ordered Li Yannian, commander of the Suijing Department in the Third District, to search and disband them. Li ordered Xie Fusan, commander of the 26th Brigade of the Ninth Division, to personally lead a thousand men from the 51st Regiment and more than 300 men from the 9th Security Regiment, to spread out in Matou District in the early morning of the 6th at 3:00 a.m., from Nanpu in the south to Jiudu in the east, Yuangiaoling in the west, and Dabapu in the north, taking a large encirclement of the villages in Matou District, searching Jiudu, Kuzhu, Tangbian, Kutian, Gechun, and other villages from 3:00 a.m. on the 6th to late at night on the 7th. A total of more than 20 people, including Chen Weijin's mother Chen Lei, Chen Weijin's third concubine Lin Xueyu, who had just been sent back from Japan, Chen's sister-in-law, Chen's confidants Chen Shiwen, Chen Bing, Chen Qian, and Chen Zhen, were arrested. Chen Shijin escaped, but his mother was arrested. Also, male and female teachers of the Central Primary School in Matou, who were suspected of being members of Chen's party, were arrested. After interrogation, they were released on bail. A certain member of the Incense and Paper Donation Bureau was also suspected of being a member of Chen's party and was detained for strict interrogation. At the same time, in Chen's mother's hometown, a large cannon was unearthed, in a very new style, which was purchased from Germany by the former Chen Guohui, worth 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. After Chen's family members were arrested, they were escorted to the 20th Brigade Headquarters, and Brigade Commander Xie personally interrogated them. Chen's mother volunteered to be responsible for handing over all the firearms hidden by her son, and then ordered Lei Jinpi to lead the way, and a gun-making machine was found in Jiudu, which could make machine guns and rifles, and the scale was very large, which was rare in Fujian Province. Also, fifteen boxes of bullets were found in Xialiao, and two cannon wheels and a mortar were unearthed in Kutian. As for the rest, Chen's mother said she did not know where they were hidden. When Chen's family members were arrested, Chen's mother entrusted Chen Pingqing, who had previously served as the magistrate of Yongchun County under Chen Guohui and is now the manager of Quanzhou Yongde Automobile Company, to plead with Brigade Commander Xie. Brigade Commander Xie ordered all the hidden guns to be handed over at noon on the 8th, and ordered Chen Weijin and his party members to rehabilitate themselves, and then Chen's family members would be released. Chen agreed, but failed to fulfill the agreement on the scheduled date, and then requested a three-day extension. From the 9th to the 11th, the deadline for handing over the weapons was still not fulfilled. Now three requests for extension have been made, until the 14th. If the hidden weapons are still not fully handed over by the deadline, Chen's family members will still be dealt with. Currently, Chen's mother, Chen Shijin's mother and wife, and other important party members are all banned in Jiudu and heavily guarded.</p>
<p>Songjiang Builds Branch Line, Dongmen Strikes</p>
<p>After Songsi Road was opened to automobile traffic, construction began on a branch line connecting with Songhui Road, about two li long, passing through a section of Dongwai Market Street. Local gentry and businessmen previously believed that it would hinder the prosperity of Dongwai Market, and petition representatives continued to travel back and forth, appealing repeatedly. Magistrate Jin had repeatedly promised to temporarily suspend work and wait for the provincial government to issue instructions. However, the workers continued to step up their work. Yesterday, piles were driven in the Dongmen Market River to build bridges. Merchants and residents felt that the market had been divided into two and could not be maintained. Now, it even blocks commercial transportation, believing that there is no hope for business operations and that the demolition of houses is too much of a sacrifice. They telegraphed the province to fight for their rights and automatically went on strike yesterday. After the local gentry reported to the county government, Magistrate Jin ordered the director of the Public Security Bureau, the district chief of the first district, and several standing members of the Chamber of Commerce to rush to persuade them and at the same time remove the piles to open up the transportation. Then they resumed business. Now, the local merchants and residents have telegraphed the provincial government again, requesting the dispatch of personnel to inspect and listen to a normal solution.</p>
<h3>New County Magistrate's Definite Date of Taking Office</h3>
<p>The newly appointed County Magistrate Li Leng recently telegraphed his friends here, saying that he will arrive in Songjiang by early train on the 15th to take office. The county government is speeding up the handover work so that it can be handed over on time. Hou Mingen, the former chief of the Second Section, has been ordered to transfer to the Chuansha County government. There will be major changes at that time.</p>
<p>Suzhou, Construction Bureau Approves Continuation of Road Widening</p>
<p>The Wu County Construction Bureau has completed the project of widening the streets in the east, west, and middle markets inside Changmen. However, the problem of the sidewalk has not been resolved because the entire business community there firmly requested to lay cement. Director Zhou of the Construction Bureau recently accepted the request of the business community on the road outside Changmen to continue widening the section of the street from the Changmen city gate through the drawbridge to the Yuyudun to Shilu Intersection and rebuild the Changmen city gate to facilitate transportation. He immediately drafted a plan and project budget and submitted it to the Construction Department for instructions. On the 13th, he received instructions from the Construction Department for approval and must start construction within the year. After the streets are widened, cars can go directly from the road to the east, west, and middle markets in the city, which greatly facilitates transportation and is of great importance to the development of commerce.</p>
<p>Wuxi, Anti-Smoking Inspectors Arrive in Wuxi for Spot Checks</p>
<p>In order to investigate the recent anti-smoking situation in various counties, the Department of Civil Affairs specially sent Inspector Wu Jichen to inspect the counties along the Jinghu Road. After receiving the order, Wu arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Wang and stated his intentions. Secretary Xia Dingwen accompanied him to inspect the county drug rehabilitation center and the prison branch. In the afternoon, he continued to go to various opium dens and smoking houses to conduct spot checks. Once the work in Wuxi is completed, he will go to the Suzhou-Changzhou area for inspection.</p>
<p>Changzhou, Requesting to Stop Collecting Business Tax on Behalf</p>
<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the afternoon of the 12th, chaired by Xu Juxi, and resolved important cases: (1) The floods in Jiangbei were severe, and the chamber should promote fundraising to relieve the disaster victims. It was resolved that in addition to separate fundraising by various industries, advertisements should be placed in newspapers to solicit donations. (2) The brokerage firms collect business tax on behalf of the government. Zhejiang Province has now canceled it. It is proposed to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to follow the example of Zhejiang and quickly order the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to stop collecting the tax to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. It was resolved to pass it. (3) The Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association came to Changzhou to hold a national goods exhibition. A letter was sent to the chamber and the Federation of Trade Unions to discuss borrowing a venue. It was resolved that the local industrial and commercial groups are preparing for a national goods exhibition. The chamber will jointly reply to the association with the Federation of Trade Unions, asking them to postpone their visit to Changzhou.</p>
<p>Yangzhou, Preparing for Autumn Firefighting Review</p>
<p>This county has received a notice from the provincial capital to hold a firefighting exercise and review competition this autumn. The Public Security Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of various fire brigades in the city and suburbs at 2:00 p.m. on the 12th. More than 30 representatives from more than 20 fire brigades, including Xiangshan and Quanan, attended the meeting. Yao Yuncong, chief of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau, chaired the meeting. Seventeen detailed rules for the review were resolved to be held on October 20 in accordance with the provincial capital. Members from various fire brigades will be organized to prepare everything in advance with the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau Limits Demolition of Houses for Bridge Repair</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Construction Bureau believes that the Kaiming Bridge east of Siwang Pavilion in the old city is located in a key transportation area, but it has been in disrepair for a long time. For the sake of tidying up the city appearance, it has formulated a development plan, planning to demolish the houses on both sides of the bridge to widen it. It has now drawn up a plan and submitted it to the Construction Department for instructions. The Construction Department has approved the construction of a flat bridge. The County Construction Bureau has notified the Public Security Bureau, which has notified twelve shops next to the bridge to move out within two months.</p>
<h3>Opium Offender Flees, Recaptured and Shackled</h3>
<p>Lu Naixiang, a resident of Touqiao Town, the third district of Jiangdu, was detained by the county government for privately smoking opium and handed over to the Political Police Office for custody. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 p.m. yesterday (11th), Lu actually escaped from custody, lifting the iron wire of the skylight net in the patio. Later, the police on duty, together with the police chief, checked the number of people and called Lu's name but received no response. The entire team patrolled for days, dispatched to various city gates to check. Chasing to the Huoqiao wharf, Lu was about to board the Datong steamer to Shanghai. He was immediately arrested and reported to County Magistrate Ma, who instructed him to be shackled and strictly dealt with.</p>
<p>Nantong, Turmoil in the Native Cloth Market Unresolved</p>
<p>The establishment of the Nantong Native Cloth Market, which centralizes cloth merchants to collect cloth, strictly stipulates standards, and cracks down on fraud, was mistaken by weavers as hindering the cloth market, causing a crowd to destroy it. After the opening ceremony on the 12th, the weavers broke in again. After the military and police suppressed it, the crowd dispersed. However, on the way, Wang Songtao, an employee of the market, was suddenly kidnapped and rescued by the police team at Yaogang. Thirty-eight people were arrested on the spot and sent to the County Public Security Bureau together. More than a thousand weavers entered the city to petition the county government, and the shops closed one after another, causing great chaos. All the military and police were dispatched, but the weavers insisted on demanding people from the county government. The soldiers opened fire to warn them, but it was ineffective. The bullet injured a weaver, Ni Sigehai, who was sent to Nantong Hospital for treatment after being examined by the court. The 38 people arrested were released on bail by Xu, the chief of the first district, at 7:00 p.m. that evening. The weavers then agreed to return home. The special commissioner's office and the county government believe that the purpose of the native cloth market is to promote rural sideline occupations and develop foreign trade. The weavers have not been able to understand it. In addition to the publicity by the heads of townships and villages, the native cloth market is ordered to open as usual.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, Minor Disputes Lead to Homicide</p>
<p>Wu, the wife of Pei Jinfu (a mason), a resident of the west end of Sanbu Liangpan Bridge in Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, used to set up a stall in front of her door to sell vegetables. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 a.m. on the 12th, a certain wife of Zhou Wu Mao, a tofu maker, passed by the vegetable stall, and two small foreign coins fell to the ground. Wu actually stepped on them, causing a dispute. At the same time, Pei Jinfu helped his wife Wu beat Zhou's wife severely, even with fists and feet. Zhou's wife was injured and fell to the ground, unconscious. After someone informed the Fifth Public Security Branch, the police arrested the two murderers (Pei Jinfu and his wife Wu) and tried to find a doctor for treatment, but she did not wake up. By evening, her limbs were icy, and she had only a breath left, and her life was feared to be unsalvageable.</p>
<p>Holding Training Course for Township Chiefs</p>
<p>嘉xing County Government once considered the heads and deputies of rural towns as cadres for promoting county administration, with very significant responsibilities. All heads and deputies of rural towns throughout the county have been carefully reviewed by the county government and rewarded or punished accordingly. Currently, a training session for heads and deputies of rural towns is being organized. The plan has been drafted by the Civil Affairs Section, and the training is scheduled to begin on October 21st, lasting for seven days. The training methods include lectures, discussions, practical exercises, and individual interviews. The training subjects cover the county's administrative overview, Baojia laws and regulations, air defense knowledge, international situation, and the essentials of the New Life Movement. Additionally, health check-ups will be conducted. The county magistrate will soon instruct all heads and deputies of rural towns to comply and report on time for the training.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Malaria Epidemic Along the Southern Yushan Section</p>
<p>The Hengfeng-Yiyang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Yushan section was originally a lair of communist bandits. Since the bandits were suppressed, corpses have been left in the mountains and fields, a ghastly sight, and impossible to bury. As a result, a type of virulent malaria suddenly appeared after autumn, spreading rapidly. Over four hundred of the five hundred or so railway workers in that section have contracted the disease, and many have died. In recent days, the number of local residents who have died is about one hundred. This has greatly affected the track-laying project, causing it to be significantly delayed. The Railway Bureau has dispatched doctors with a large supply of medicine to treat the patients. In recent days, this malaria has spread to the Yushan area and efforts are underway to eradicate it.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Grand Welcome for Archbishop Cai</p>
<p>The Papal Delegate to China, Archbishop Cai of Ningbo, is stationed in Beiping. This time, he went south to inspect church affairs in various parts of Jiangnan. Wherever he went, he was warmly welcomed. Archbishop Cai, along with his secretary Yu Bin and Lu Bohong, arrived in Ningbo on the Xin Ningshao steamer from Shanghai on the 11th. Upon receiving this telegram, various agencies in Ningbo and the Catholic Church on the north bank of the Jiangbei River erected colored arches to welcome him in front of the church door by the pier. Earlier, they had sent representatives to Shanghai to personally greet the archbishop. When the Xin Ningshao arrived at the port at 6:30 am on the 12th, representatives from various agencies and churches boarded the ship to welcome him. At that time, firecrackers were set off and military music was played. Archbishop Cai, led by Bishop Dai, disembarked and boarded a car, with military music leading the way. Welcomers lined the docks and proceeded in an orderly fashion to the Catholic Church on the north bank of the Jiangbei River to attend Mass. At noon, the garrison commander Wang Haonan, Commissioner Zhao Cisheng, County Magistrate Chen Baolin, Police Chief Yu Jimin, Court President Wang Bingyi, Standing Committee member of the Party Headquarters Wu Zemin, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuochen, and others held a public banquet at the Chamber of Commerce. It is also heard that Archbishop Cai has scheduled dates to inspect various churches in Ningbo and celebrate Mass. He is expected to stay in Ningbo for four or five days before proceeding to Haimen for inspection.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief is Saving Lives</p>
<p>Donate One More Penny, Save One More Life</p>
<p>Telegram</p>
<p>To Xu Junjian, Director of the Jiangsu Guiding Huai River into the Sea Project: I recently read the Shen Bao of October 3rd, and the Xinwen Bao of the same day, both carrying reports that Engineer Shen Caiyi of the Huai River Project sent a telegram to the office, stating that County Magistrate Deng of Shuyang reported to the office that thousands of pine trees and thousands of bundles of rice straw, more than two thousand sacks and twelve thousand rush bags, and ten tons of lead wire were used for the emergency rescue project, which are all untrue. He also stated that ten tons of lead wire would weigh more than six thousand tons, and assuming each train car carries thirty tons, it would take more than two hundred cars to transport them. Shuyang is a remote county and certainly does not have such a large amount of lead wire. The wood pilings were requisitioned from Donghai County. As for the number of sacks and rush bags, whether the quantity is factual can be inferred. Furthermore, when the new dike breached, the county magistrate did not send a single person to stop the breach. Please investigate, etc. I have read the Xin Hai Bao and Su Bei Daily, which have similar records. I am very surprised. Upon investigation, on the night of September 20th, at the central opening of the old Six Tang River dike, I was personally at the construction site. At that time, due to the high water pressure and difficulty in obtaining earth, it was impossible to stop the breach. I telegraphed to dispatch hundreds of laborers from Yangkou, using tree pilings and door panels to protect the place where the breach of the old dike led directly to the new dike, and sent a Huang Protection Committee member Wang Shirong to escort four sailing boats from Tanggou, which were arranged in the above-mentioned place to block the water flow. After the emergency protection was in place, they went to Tanggou, on the one hand dispatching laborers from Tanggou to the new dike to drive piles and add firewood, and on the other hand discussing with the two county magistrates He and Xu, and the three counties jointly carried out the emergency protection of the new dike. Muyang sent five thousand laborers, Donghai three thousand, Siyang one thousand five hundred. The laborers from Muyang who should have been sent could not be conscripted because the west of the river had already been flooded. The water level of Nan Liu Tang was not yet flat, and there was no danger, so three thousand five hundred laborers were telegraphed from the five townships of Gao Dong, Gao Xi, Gao Nan, Gao Bei, Shuohu and the two towns of Yangkou and Gaogou, and eight hundred people each were dispatched from the fifth and eighth districts. The laborers from Yangkou and Gaogou towns immediately crossed the river to the new dike opposite Yangkou, and the laborers from the fifth district had also approached Tanggou. I, together with the two county magistrates He and Xu, and the three engineers Shen, Wang and Xue, went to the new dike to inspect. Before half of the journey was completed, it was reported that there was a breach in front, so we turned around and retreated, and the back road also breached. We went under the dike to bypass the water head, then went to the top of the dike, and another place in front of our feet breached. After desperately jumping over it, another place at the rear breached. The dike body was near the water for only four hours, and the water level was no more than two Luo Chi at the deepest point. Within five minutes, there were four breaches, and the quality of the dike was as fragile as rice flour, and when it encountered water, it was like boiling water. At that time, everyone who saw it thought that the entire dike would collapse, but I thought it could not be rescued, and even the engineers thought there was no way. After discussion at the Tanggou Township Office, I and County Magistrate He immediately retreated to the north bank of the Chaimi River. County Magistrate Xu returned to protect the Yan River. The above-mentioned course of events can be described in detail not only by the two county magistrates He and Xu, but also by the two engineers Yuan and. Shen Caiyi returned to the dangerous place, knowing the truth, but deliberately set up words to attack Xu, and did not know what his intention was. As for the Donghai people, they assisted in repairing the Chaimi North Dike, and did not bring pile grass. It was all supplied by Shuyang. As for the West Dike of the Liu Tang River, only four hundred more people were dispatched by me from Donghai on the afternoon of September 20th to repair the Heng Dike above Tanggou. All the pile grass was taken on the spot. The willows along the banks of the Liu Tang and Chaimi Rivers were almost completely cut down. The willow stakes used in Moyang, and the number claimed by the engineer, will be ten times more than this. The number of rice straw is even more than this. The above-mentioned willow stakes are all requisitioned on the spot and not valued. The public can see and hear this, and no one dares to fabricate the price to profit, so there is no need to argue. The rush bags and sacks used have not yet been settled. The reports from various parts have not been received. I can't figure it out for a while. As for what the official said, Shuyang reported that ten tons of lead wire had been used, and added fuel to the fire to frighten people. I don't know which month and day of the report the official based on in this county. How much has the county applied for the expenses for flood control before and after, and the Jun office has accounts to check, and no money has been taken from the local area. How can there be financial resources to buy so many tons of lead wire? This government has not made such a false report, and the official deliberately fabricated the facts and tarnished the reputation, which is not worth a smile to the knowledgeable. However, the talk of the city tiger, the hearers change color, Zeng Shen killed people, and his mother was also shocked. Xianghai has been serving as an official in Shanghai for nearly twenty years. He has no other strengths, but he can be confident in his integrity. The official's unfounded slander is regarded as a lifelong shame and humiliation. Reputation is the second life, and it is difficult to remain silent. I have to declare the facts and respectfully ask you to approve, and send letters to various newspapers to correct them. I am very grateful. Deng Xianghai, County Magistrate of Shuyang, kowtows.</p>

<h3>The City Council Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting Prudent Handling of Telephone Rate Increases, Which Should Consider the Interests of Citizens to Avoid Further Troubles</h3>
<p>The Takung Society reports that the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association, regarding the issue of telephone rate increases by the Shanghai Telephone Company, after the Public Works Department of the Public Concession hired telephone experts from China, Britain, America, and Japan to come to Shanghai and participate in the Telephone Expert Committee for research, has already completed its work and is now compiling a final report to be submitted to the Public Works Department for adoption. However, according to reports in various newspapers, the British, American, and Japanese experts still advocate charging by call. This news has spread, causing public consternation. The association convened its second representative meeting and resolved to firmly oppose telephone rate increases and charging by call. If necessary, it will also convene a user meeting to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting prudent handling of telephone rate increases and charging issues to avoid disputes. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, regarding the issue of telephone rate increases by the Shanghai Telephone Company, your department hired experts from China, America, Britain, and Japan to come to Shanghai for research, and a final report has been compiled and submitted to your department for consideration. According to reports, the Expert Committee still advocates charging by call. Upon hearing this, the public is alarmed. We believe that telephone service is a public utility, and its function is to facilitate communication. The level of charges should be based on the economic capacity of the citizens, as has been repeatedly communicated in previous letters. Moreover, at a time when the local economy is in panic and worsening, and the southern industries are in decline day by day, people are already feeling severe pressure from existing expenses and are unable to maintain them. How can they bear any further burdens? Regarding telephone charges, if charging by call and disguised rate increases are adopted, users will find it impossible to endure and will have no choice but to jointly dismantle their telephones. We believe that telephones are of great importance to social stability. If they are jointly dismantled, the company will not benefit, and the stability of the concession will be greatly affected. Your council, as the highest authority for managing the administrative and security affairs of the concession, should take into account the interests of the tax-paying citizens and give careful consideration and strict handling to the issue of telephone rate increases and charging by call, so as to avoid further troubles. This would be fortunate for society and fortunate for the citizens. Respectfully addressed to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession."</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Association has previously expressed its opposition to telephone rate increases. Now, the company is about to change its charging method to charging by call. If this method is implemented, telephone bills will inevitably increase immediately. In order to prevent the company from charging by call and ease the burden on users, the association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, requesting them to find ways to prevent this. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, in recent times, the market has been sluggish, all industries are declining, and the economy is stagnant, reaching a critical point. At this time, all public utilities should reduce their prices to jointly maintain the precarious situation. However, the telephone company fails to see this and repeatedly raises prices despite the extreme economic panic of the citizens. Recently, we heard that they are about to change the charging method to charging by call. If this method is implemented, telephone bills will inevitably exceed the original amount by several times, and the burden on users will increase immediately. Since telephone service is a public utility, the telephone charges cannot be calculated solely for the benefit of the company without considering the burden on users. The company's insistence on going its own way not only violates the principle of public utilities but also disrupts social order and peace of mind. If swift measures are not taken to prevent this, what will become of the users? This association, witnessing the collapse of the market, deeply wishes not to see the phenomenon of social unrest again. Therefore, we are writing to earnestly request your department to consider the difficulties of business and quickly forward a letter to the company, urging them not to implement the method of charging by call, in order to comply with public sentiment and ease the burden on users. This would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully addressed to the Public Works Department of the French Concession."</p>

<h3>Hong San Telephones Shanghai to Report on Disaster Conditions in Xihua and Other Counties; Xihua County Has 550,000 Mu of Flooded Farmland; Disaster Situation in Shangshui is Similar to That in Xihua</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces recently received a telegram from Hong San, Director of the Henan Disaster Relief Office, reporting on the disaster situation in the Xihua County area. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Telegram</p>
<p>Chairman and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Your instructions have been respectfully received. Since returning from Fengqiu, San and two staff members went south to Xihua this month. The next day, together with the county magistrate and others, we personally inspected the disaster area and the breach in the Shahe River at Nandukou. The county has over 550,000 mu of flooded farmland, and over 4,900 houses have been washed away. The number of affected households is as high as over 40,000. The situation is dire and unbearable to witness, especially in Zhuchumu and Yangsizhuang in the Sixth District. Located on the banks of the Shahe River, they bear the brunt of the breach. The water has been flooded for three months, and no crops remain. Although the floodwaters have receded, the land is covered with sand and is no longer suitable for cultivation. Many residents live in grass huts, barely surviving. Their state of starvation is truly heartbreaking. When we arrived near Zhuzhuang, hundreds of elderly women, carrying infants in their arms, knelt on the road, tears streaming down their faces, begging for prompt relief. After much consolation, they dispersed. Their eagerness to survive is evident. We continued south and arrived in Dengcheng in the Fifth District of Shangshui County. Guided by Zhang, the section chief representing the county, we inspected the second, third, and fourth disaster areas. The water from the breach in the Shahe River inundated these areas, so the disaster area covers almost the entire county. The autumn harvest is hopeless, many livestock have died, and the residents are emaciated, barely surviving. The situation is as dire as in Xihua. We returned to Kaifeng and made a brief stay. The office has now been surveyed and determined to be located in the disaster-affected children's orphanage along the Hebei River in Zhengzhou. As for the date of distribution, as soon as the relief tickets arrive, we will send personnel to various counties to begin household surveys and distribution.</p>
<p>Hong San of the Henan Disaster Relief Office of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces kowtows.</p>
<p>Assistance from All Sides</p>
<p>All directors and staff of the local Chinese Merchant Electric Tram Company, out of sympathy for the compatriots in the disaster areas of various provinces, donated several thousand yuan from the company's directors and staff. In addition, the company's entire tram operating revenue for the Double Tenth Festival was used to raise a total of 10,000 yuan for relief. Yesterday, the company sent a letter with the donation to the Disaster Relief Committee for distribution in the disaster areas. In addition, the Jiashan County Disaster Relief Fundraising Opera Performance Office also remitted over 189 yuan to the relief fund yesterday through the Bank of China.</p>
<h3>Seafarer Examinations Extended to Mid-December; One Month Extension; Order to Seafarers to Take Examinations Promptly</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is conducting seafarer examinations. Those who have not been examined have been ordered by the Ministry to the Maritime Affairs Bureaus in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other ports to begin conducting examinations for both deck and engine department seafarers from the 16th of this month for a period of one month, ending on November 14th. Seafarers who have not been examined have been ordered to register and take the examinations promptly, otherwise their seafarer service qualifications will be revoked. Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, stating that the seafarer examinations have been scheduled to end on November 14th. However, considering that there are over 1,000 merchant ships nationwide, requiring a large number of seafarers, the registration and examination dates are now extended from November 20th to December 15th. This one-month extension is to provide an opportunity for seafarers who have not yet taken the examinations to take them. If they do not take the examinations by this deadline, it will be difficult to make up the examinations. A special telegram has been sent to the local shipping companies to inform all seafarers to comply.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Actively Plans and Strictly Organizes the National Products Market; New Registration Rules Promulgated; Those Who Violate Them Will Be Banned</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau considers that there are many temporary national products markets and national products exhibitions recently established in this city. However, the more there are, the easier it is for them to become abusive. Some of them may have unsound organizations, which will not only fail to fulfill the responsibility of promoting national products but also affect the reputable temporary national products markets and national products exhibitions. This will inevitably be more harmful than beneficial. In order to prevent the establishment of such unsoundly organized national products markets and to ensure the sound organization of various markets, the Social Affairs Bureau has recently formulated and officially promulgated the "Registration Rules for National Products Markets and National Products Exhibitions in This City." The rules stipulate that those who apply to hold a temporary national products market or a national products exhibition must submit the articles of association one month in advance, stating the location of the venue, its layout, the types of manufacturers and products participating, and other details. The application must be signed by all the organizers and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration. Temporary markets or exhibitions approved by the Social Affairs Bureau must still comply with the regulations of the relevant competent authorities regarding construction, sanitation, water and electricity, traffic safety, and fire protection. Those who violate the provisions of the registration rules or change their content after being approved for registration will be banned by the Social Affairs Bureau. The full text of the rules is recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 1: Those who hold or solicit manufacturers in this city to hold a temporary national products market or a national products exhibition in other cities must comply with the provisions of these rules.</p>
<p>Article 2: Temporary national products markets or national products exhibitions, except those organized by the competent authorities, may be initiated by established commercial organizations or by 50 or more national products manufacturers with real capital.</p>
<p>Article 3: Those who apply to hold a temporary national products market or a national products exhibition must submit the articles of association one month in advance, stating the following details. The application must be signed by all the organizers and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration: (1) Location of the venue and its layout (with drawings); (2) Duration of the exhibition and the date of preparation; (3) Participating manufacturers and types of products; (4) Estimated income and expenditure.</p>
<p>Article 4: The applicant shall, within five days after the registration is approved, submit a list of the names, addresses, and resumes of the members of the preparatory committee and the persons in charge of the conference, together with a statement of the production methods and supporting documents, to the Social Affairs Bureau for record.</p>
<p>Article 5: The applicant shall prepare for and hold the event within the time limit after the registration is approved. If the event is postponed for any reason, the applicant shall submit a written explanation to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval before the deadline.</p>
<p>Article 6: After approving the registration, the Social Affairs Bureau shall notify the relevant agencies and organizations to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Article 7: When preparing to hold a temporary national products market or a national products exhibition, the preparatory expenses shall be borne equally by the organizers.</p>
<p>Article 8: The account books and vouchers shall be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for review.</p>
<p>Article 9: Those who violate the provisions of these rules or change their content after being approved for registration will be banned by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Article 10: Temporary markets or exhibitions approved by the Social Affairs Bureau must still comply with the regulations of the relevant competent authorities regarding construction, sanitation, water and electricity, traffic safety, security, and fire protection.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Zhang Yongqin Brings His Wife to Shanghai; Forced to Return to Japan by the Japanese Consulate; Arrested at the Lao Gongxin Hotel in Shiliupu; Couple Inevitably Separated After Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Shiye Society reports that overseas Chinese Zhang Yongqin, a native of Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, has been running a noodle shop in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, for many years. He married a Japanese woman from that area as his wife. They worked hard all day and were able to make a decent living. Recently, he was forced to close his business by the police station in the county, leaving him unable to stand on his feet. He went alone to Nagasaki to wait for a ship to return to China. His wife found out about this, and determined not to serve two husbands, she hoped to share the joys and sorrows. With the consent of her parents, she pursued him to Nagasaki and boarded a ship of the Da Lai Company with her husband, arriving in Shanghai on the 11th. Unexpectedly, as soon as they arrived at the Lao Gongxin Hotel, the Japanese Consulate sent personnel with documents, accompanied by the Shiliupu Public Security Branch, to arrest Zhang Yongqin and his wife and take them back to the consulate for interrogation. As a result, Zhang Yongqin was forced to send his wife back to Japan. Unable to do otherwise, Mr. Zhang accompanied his wife on the Shanghai Maru today and left Shanghai to return to Japan. The situation was very tragic.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened a joint meeting of various institutions and legal organizations in the city at its office at No. 572, corner of Avenue Baille and Route Lafayette in the French Concession yesterday (Sunday) at 10:00 AM to discuss matters related to the establishment of a preparatory committee for a Protection Association for Released Prisoners.

The facts are as follows: The plaintiff married at the age of 20. The defendant is the manager and director of a bookstore, and also holds important positions such as accounting department and lease account room of Shanghai __ Nursing Home, with considerable income. He secretly kept a mistress outside. Last autumn, the plaintiff discovered this and tried to persuade him. The defendant knew he was wrong and wrote a letter of repentance, which he gave to the plaintiff to keep, guaranteeing that the same incident would not happen again. However, last winter, the defendant again had a secret rendezvous with a woman in Room 26 of the Wuzhou Hotel. The plaintiff caught them in person. Afterwards, he repeatedly refused to correct his behavior. Since February of this year, he has not paid household expenses (30 yuan per month) and pocket money (10 yuan per month), totaling 280 yuan for seven months. He often stayed out all night. On April 23rd, he ran away, and there was no news of him. On the 27th, the plaintiff posted a notice in the newspaper to look for him. On May 30th, the defendant led a group of people to force the plaintiff to the Xin Xin Hotel to sign and fingerprint a divorce agreement that they had written. The plaintiff played along and instructed the defendant to sign and fingerprint first. At this point, the plaintiff could no longer bear it and shouted for help. The plaintiff saw that they were panicked and fled. The plaintiff only knew to be faithful to one man until the end. Therefore, she requested that the defendant be summoned to court and ordered to cohabitate, and to allocate living expenses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen summoned the parties for questioning. The woman testified about the previous events and requested legal aid. It was decided to wait for investigation and then conduct a joint trial.</p>

Later, Tao Jiankang, a native of Anhui who runs a pancake shop next door, reported to Lu that his daughter had been abducted by Ren Chan Hong and that he could find out by asking him. Lu knew Ren, so he went to his home at No. 15 Yangshupu Road to look for his daughter, but he could not find her. When he questioned Ren about where she was hidden, Ren initially denied it. The Chinese detectives Peng Zhenxuan and Liu Zhisheng arrived and arrested Ren. Ren then revealed where Xiufeng was hidden.

<h3>Mei Lanfang Advocates for Disaster Victims; Speaks on Performing to Aid Relief</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the beginning of summer this year, the Yangtze and Yellow River basins have experienced successive floods, inundating fields and homes, and causing people and livestock to be swept away. The disaster is extremely severe, affecting more than ten provinces and millions of people. Relief efforts are urgently needed. Therefore, various sectors of this city, responding to the needs of the situation, have specially initiated and established the Provincial Flood Relief Associations to advocate for the disaster victims. Since the commencement of work, the amount of support from all parties and enthusiastic donations of money and goods from people of all walks of life has been substantial. In addition to the charity performances previously held at the New World and the film star aid concert at the Great Shanghai Garden, Mr. Mei Lanfang, who recently arrived in the country, has been invited to perform at the Golden Theater to aid relief. The grand scenes of the past few days have been repeatedly recorded in newspapers. Yesterday, reporters specially visited Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Li Dachao, deputy director of the fundraising group of the Flood Relief Association, to inquire about everything. Details are specially recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's Remarks</p>
<p>Reporters noted that Mr. Mei's willingness to perform despite his illness to advocate for disaster victims demonstrates a commendable public-spirited enthusiasm. Therefore, we specially visited Mr. Mei the day before yesterday. He first stated that he received much support from various parties before going abroad. Upon returning to the country, he was further encouraged by various sectors. Such gratitude and pleasant emotions cannot be described in words. He can only work hard to live up to the expectations of the people. As for the issues of improving national opera and Western opera, learning from each other's strengths, and compensating for weaknesses, he has already briefly reported upon his return to the country, which has been published in newspapers. No need to elaborate further. However, this mission involves great responsibility, and cannot be accomplished by an individual alone. He hopes that writers and playwrights can offer guidance and assistance. Currently, what he can do is only start from small things. However, each has its own strengths, such as the time-saving and economic aspects of national opera, the dance steps, and so on, which others cannot match. When he visited Europe previously, he watched various dramas more than seventy times. Although he dares not say he has a deep understanding, the impressions he gained of the essence of various dramas are quite profound. Therefore, he is eager to make improvements to the best of his ability. The stones from other hills can be used to polish jade. After returning to the country, he originally intended to rest temporarily. While recuperating, he would take this opportunity to conduct diligent and focused research on national opera. However, the disaster situation in various places this year is severe, unseen in a century. As a citizen, he should have sympathy and compassion, and should do his best. After completing performances in Beijing and Hangzhou, he returned to Shanghai and, urged by various parties, he reluctantly contributed his meager efforts. He is deeply encouraged by the care and expectations of all parties.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Remarks</p>
<p>The Flood Relief Association was established in August this year by more than one hundred leaders of various groups and organizations in this city. Yesterday, reporters visited Mr. Li Dachao, deputy director of the fundraising group of the association. He said that when the association was established, he contributed several fundraising plans, which were passed by the general meeting and assigned to different groups to implement. These included general donations, donations from the wealthy, city-wide rent donations, the city's film industry, the dance industry, and designating one day's operating income to be fully used for relief. These have been gradually implemented. In addition to fundraising through various channels, a charity fair was held at the New World and a "Hundred Flowers Aid Relief" concert was held last month, as well as a film star aid relief concert at the Great Shanghai Garden. There were also national martial arts aid relief competitions, football aid relief competitions, swimming aid relief competitions, and so on. Each event achieved excellent results and had a significant impact. He hopes that gentlemen, ladies, and celebrities will provide enthusiastic support to save the people affected by the disaster.</p>
<p>Donations from Various Parties</p>
<p>The association continued to receive donations in the past two days, including 309.24 yuan from the Shanghai Citizen-Run Wireless Broadcasting Industry Association through Yongshun Bank's Zhou Fusheng Chuan and 32 households; 230 yuan from Mr. Nie Hanzhang through Huiyun Layman's Hongde Yu Paper Shop and 7 colleagues; 235.19 yuan from 13 households including Lin Huaisang and Lin Huguang, employees of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Administration; 176 yuan from 21 households including Song Wanfu and Tao Sheng collected by Fuyuan Zhuang; 1318.4 yuan from 13 households including the Shanghai All Circles Establish Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Preparatory Committee; 1008.28 yuan collected by Jin Cheng Bank on behalf of Weitong Heji Yarn Factory; 1900.21 yuan collected by Shen Bao on behalf of Li Sheng and 94 households; and 10 yuan from Mr. Lin Kanghou's charity auction donation to Liu Baisheng.</p>

Bian manufactured the coins, and they could make 20 to 30 coins per day. She and Gu are not a couple; Bian introduced Gu to her. Gu Zhusheng confessed that Bian Guiquan introduced him to Wang Ding. They could make 70 20-cent coins per day. After they were made, they were secretly sold for 1 yuan for every 15 lead coins. The court reviewed the confessions and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending further hearing.</p>
<h3>Kang Tih Road Vegetable Vendors Petition Chinese Directors Yesterday; Request Lu Bohong to Negotiate to Maintain Livelihoods</h3>
<p>The vegetable stalls on Kang Tih Road in the French Concession were shut down by the French Concession Police. Fifty-one shops on Kang Tih Road jointly sent a letter to the French authorities requesting them to consider the livelihoods of the vendors and postpone the shutdown. However, it has been more than a month since the stalls were shut down, and there is no news of their resumption, which has left all the stallholders facing starvation. Therefore, they once again petitioned Chinese Director Lu Bohong yesterday morning. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 5:00 AM, more than 110 stallholders, men, women, and children, gathered at Xieqiao in the Chinese Concession and walked to the Catholic Church in Dongjiadu, Xiaonanmen, to petition Lu Bohong, the Chinese Director of the French Municipal Council. When the vegetable vendors set off, they marched in orderly rows, carrying a large banner that read, "God bestows charity on the poor; requesting Mr. Lu Bohong to relieve the people's livelihood; a large petition from all the vegetable vendors on Kang Tih Road in the French Concession." They walked for about seven hours and arrived at the entrance of the Catholic Church, lining up on the road. The police on duty maintained order. Representatives of the stallholders, including Sun Chuanfu, delivered the petition to the church and requested to meet with Chinese Director Lu. Mr. Lu received them. At this time, the stallholders standing outside the door knelt down before Mr. Lu, appealing in unison. Mr. Lu persuaded the stallholders to stand up and promised to negotiate with the French Municipal Council immediately to find a way to resume the stalls. He also advised the vendors to return and wait patiently for a resolution. The vendors were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>Petition Document</p>
<p>Respectfully presented, the vegetable vendors have been shut down from setting up stalls on Kang Tih Road by the French Concession Police for more than a month. Although they have shouted and appealed until their voices are hoarse, they have not received any indication from the authorities to resume the stalls, leaving hundreds of stallholders facing starvation. The vegetable vendors have previously detailed the situation and submitted a document to your esteemed Chinese Director, requesting your gracious relief. Now, because the livelihoods of the stallholders are in extreme danger and there is no way to maintain them, they are compelled to appeal to your esteemed position once again, requesting permission to make demands on the French Municipal Council to relieve the people's livelihood, without resorting to public disturbance, and so on.</p>

<h3>Wuzhen Road Police Station Breaks Up Operation Specializing in Stealing Vehicle Parts; Four Male and Female Criminals Arrested; 175 Stolen Items Seized</h3>
<p>Recently, incidents of rickshaws being robbed of their belongings have frequently occurred in Zhabei. The rickshaw pullers are mostly ignorant and uneducated people, so they dare not report to the police. The thieves therefore regard this as a business. After a rickshaw puller loses his belongings, the accomplices of the thieves would offer to help retrieve them, demanding a sum ranging from a few cents to several yuan. The rickshaw pullers often find that the money they earn from pulling the rickshaw for a day is not enough to redeem a lost item, which is truly infuriating. Luo Siwei, a police officer at the Wuzhen Road Police Station of the New Zha Sub-bureau, took pity on them. Therefore, he secretly dispatched patrol officers to investigate. At around 1:00 PM on the 11th of this month, Police Chief Hu Yao learned that a yellow rickshaw seat was found on the roof of a tin house behind the Xiaocai Market, and that the location was often used by accomplices of the thieves to negotiate the redemption of stolen goods. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday, Police Officer Zhao Huarong reported that stolen items specializing in yellow rickshaw parts were hidden in the stove shed at No. 11 Zhaohao Lane. Officer Luo immediately led Police Chief Hu Maokui and other officers to investigate. They found two oilcloth canopies, a quilt sewn from white cloth car covers (totaling twelve car covers), and one rickshaw puller's photo license number 25376. They also found twenty-nine car cushions and seventeen car covers in the loft, along with 115 oilcloth canopies. They arrested four male and female criminals: Jiang Hongmo, Wang Xiaomao, Wu Guanshi, and Huang. After interrogation, it was learned that Wu Guanshi was the cousin of Huang Yuxiang, the leader of the thieves. However, Huang had already fled. After verifying the confessions, Officer Luo immediately sent Jiang Hongmo, Wang Xiaomao, Wu Guanshi, and Huang, along with the stolen goods, including 117 oilcloth canopies and 29 car covers and cushions each, to the New Zha Sub-bureau for interrogation. It is reported that this location is a distribution point for stolen goods, and there is still a main location somewhere else.</p>
<h3>Economic Pressure; Pitiful Suicide by Jumping from Building</h3>
<p>Lu Changfang, 36 years old, from Haimen, Jiangbei, worked as a sales clerk in the building of the Western merchant Bi Liya Company at No. 25 French Avenue. He lived in the Bi Liya warehouse at No. 3 Lao Yong'an Street behind the building. Recently, due to economic pressure, he had a moment of despair. At 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, after getting up, Lu jumped from the window of the fifth floor of the warehouse, unnoticed. He fell to the ground, suffering severe head injuries and a broken right leg. His younger brother, Lu Weidian, and the head of the sales department, Wang Yiyin from Ningbo, discovered him, but it was too late. He died shortly after. They reported to the French police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. An investigator investigated the cause of death. At noon that day, the Second Special Court was notified. Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the funeral home. It was confirmed that the deceased Lu Changfang died from injuries sustained from jumping from the building while alive. The body was handed over to the family member, Lu Changxing Zhen, for funeral arrangements. The employer, a Westerner, sympathized with the poverty of the deceased's family and provided funds for the funeral and transportation back to his hometown for burial.</p>
<h3>Yu Shunxing Accuses Adopted Son of Theft and Injuring His Parents; Court Orders Yu to Verify Injuries for Review</h3>
<p>Yu Shunxing, 40 years old, a native of Cai residing at No. 24, Lane 10, Jia Siyi Road, French Concession, reported to the French Concession Police on the 8th of this month at 8:00 PM that his adopted son, Yu Jinfa, 24 years old, had committed theft and assault, injuring his parents. He requested arrest and prosecution. The police chief approved the request and ordered Detective Xu Daorong to arrest Yu Jinfa and send him to the Second Special Court for detention. The day before yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Chen Ming of the Police Department explained the case. According to the accuser, the defendant was adopted as his son at the age of six and raised and trained to learn a trade to make a living. However, he did not engage in proper work. On June 14th of this year at 11:00 AM, he came to the house, stole clothes, and fled. On the 8th at 7:00 PM, he returned home and provoked a quarrel for no reason, injuring his head and face. He also constantly threatened to shoot him with a gun. Unable to bear the harassment, he had no choice but to report the arrest and request a heavy sentence. The defendant confessed, denying the theft and assault of his father. That night, he hit a cat, and his father was unhappy and falsely accused him of assaulting him. He reported the arrest and had him detained, requesting investigation. He did not commit the assault. The court reviewed the confessions and ordered a postponement of the hearing to the 21st. The defendant was remanded in custody, and the accuser was ordered to undergo a medical examination to verify the injuries for review by the court.</p>
<h3>Qian Guojun; Gun Tied to Lower Leg</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 PM, Liu Yunfang, the chief of the Yimiao Police Station, led police officers and Police Chief Wang Yuhai to inspect pedestrians in the area. While on Tudi Tang Street, they saw a person walking furtively. Seeing the police officers, he tried to avoid them. Chief Liu ordered him to stop and searched him. Nothing suspicious was found on his body. However, when they searched inside his socks, they found a six-inch Browning pistol tied to his lower leg (number 21807) and two bullets. When asked where the gun came from, he was evasive. He was immediately taken to the police station. It was found that the gun had been stolen from Xie Sanxin, a platoon leader of the Second Security Team, from his home. Xie is currently being held at the team headquarters. The defendant, Qian Guojun, 28 years old, from Suzhou, admitted to stealing the gun. When asked what he intended to use the gun for, he refused to answer. It was then discovered that the bullets were not original, indicating a possible robbery. In addition to a thorough interrogation, he will be sent to the General Bureau for trial.</p>

<h3>Stores on Rue de la Cité Road Request Expedited Pavement of Sidewalk</h3>
<p>Due to the inconvenience of the paved cinder sidewalks after the reconstruction of the area, the stores on Rue de la Cité Road in the French Concession requested expedited pavement of the sidewalk. The stores on Rue de la Cité Road in the French Concession requested the Municipal Council of the Fourth District to negotiate because the road construction by the French Tramway Company, which began in April, had only been completed with paved cinders, which was still inconvenient. The council sent a letter to the French Municipal Council stating, "Respectfully, according to the stores on Rue de la Cité Road, the French Tramway Company has raised the road surface and rebuilt the road surface of Rue de la Cité Road, which took four months to complete. All the sidewalks along the road have also been raised with the road surface. Although the road construction has been completed, the sidewalks are still paved with cinders, which causes sand to blow into the stores on weekdays, and is inconvenient for pedestrians when it rains, which not only affects hygiene, but also impairs the view. It is requested that your council forward a letter to the French Municipal Council, ordering the Engineering Department to expedite the paving of cement on the sidewalks of both roads to benefit pedestrians and improve hygiene, etc. It is found that the stores on the two roads have suffered losses due to the inconvenience of transportation since the road construction began. Now that the road has been completed, the sidewalks should also be paved at the same time to benefit the businesses. It is requested that your council forward the letter to the Engineering Department to expedite the completion of the sidewalk paving on Rue de la Cité Road."</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing Telegraphed to Stop Xuchang Company from Purchasing Tobacco; Company Shareholders Also Issue Statement Acknowledging Company Is Now Under Foreign Control</h3>
<p>The New Police News Agency reports that the Shanghai Tobacco Industry Association reported that the foreign British-American Tobacco Company was using Chinese nationals to establish the Xuchang Company in Xuchang, Henan, to monopolize tobacco leaves. The report was submitted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which petitioned the Ministry of Industry to investigate and stop the practice. This was reported in previous newspapers. Yu Qiaqing of the Ningbo Association telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek stating that this plan of the Xuchang Company affects the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the interior and requested that he preside over and stop it promptly. At the same time, Yang Peixiang, a shareholder and initiator of the Xuchang Company, also issued an important announcement (omitted) announcing that the company has now been taken over by foreign merchants. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Telegram</p>
<p>To Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang: The Xuchang area of Henan Province produces tobacco leaves. The tobacco industries of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou, and the cigarette manufacturers in various ports, all go there to purchase. No less than 300,000 Chinese people rely on this for a living. Most of the people engaged in this industry in Shanghai are from Ningbo. Several years ago, the foreign British-American Tobacco Company used a Chinese employee to set up a factory in Xuchang to purchase tobacco, smoke it, and sell it, controlling and oppressing the industry. This was discovered by the local authorities of the province, who immediately ordered it to stop, preserving the livelihoods of the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, someone is now colluding with foreign merchants and reviving the old trick. First, the Xuchang Company came forward to plan, and then the name of the Yu Su Baked Tobacco Factory was used to transfer it to the control of the foreign British-American Tobacco Company. Now, a huge sum of money has been raised to set up a factory there, and the weighing scale will be opened soon to purchase tobacco, with the intention of making a clean sweep. The industry is calling on all parties to work together to stop this foreign economic invasion, which, if implemented, will cut off the livelihoods of the Chinese people. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has also verified the facts and sent separate telegrams to request intervention. However, it has recently been heard that those colluding with foreign merchants dare to use the name of the Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee to achieve their private goals. Because this matter concerns the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, I dare not withhold what I have heard. Therefore, I telegraph to you, Your Excellency, requesting you to preside over and telegraph to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Henan Provincial Government to forcefully stop it, so as to avoid harming the locality and maintain the people's livelihoods. The fellow villagers are deeply grateful and send their best wishes. Your younger brother Yu HeDe respectfully bows. Issued by the Ningbo Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>British Merchant Establishes Lun Chang Company in Pudong; Dividing Into Spinning, Weaving, Bleaching, Dyeing, and Printing Departments with New Equipment</h3>
<p>The factory established by the British Lun Chang Textile Bleaching Dyeing and Printing Co., Ltd. in Pudong is grand in scale and has long been completed. Its machines are all the latest British models and are divided into spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and printing departments. Senior management personnel, such as technicians, are all British, but the workers are all Chinese. It has been in operation for a long time. Last month, a female worker in the weaving department had a conflict with the British manager, causing a strike. It was resolved after persuasion by Director Zhang of the Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. It is said that this is the first time that British merchants have established a bleaching and printing factory in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>After the Italian-Ethiopian War, Chinese Merchants Purchased a Large Amount of Pigments, Totalling Over Two Million Yuan in Chinese Currency. The Association Resolved That All Goods Must Be Paid for in Cash.</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Shanghai’s Western pigment merchants and various regional associations in Shanghai, recalling the European War of 1914, when pigment imports were cut off, prices soared more than tenfold, and profits were substantial, have recently been closely monitoring the Italian-Ethiopian War. With the League of Nations passing sanctions, fearing a similar event to 1914, they have been actively contacting German and other foreign firms to purchase large amounts of spot goods, amounting to over two million yuan in Chinese currency. The German firm's pigment inventory in its warehouses has been completely cleared, an unprecedented event. Subsequently, the Shanghai Western Pigment Industry Association specifically resolved that no pre-orders would be accepted, and all sales would be for cash. Their announcement is recorded as follows: The association's merchants are concerned that sales to customers may fluctuate, leading to disputes during account settlement. For the sake of the industry's business interests, rectification is required. At the 21st standing committee meeting on the 7th of this month, it was resolved that since the start of the Italian-Ethiopian War, foreign firms are not accepting pre-orders for sales, and payment in cash is required upon completion of the transaction. As the firms are now implementing this method, all merchants should follow suit and not accept pre-orders, with all sales being for cash. This has been passed and recorded. In addition to sending separate notifications, this announcement is hereby issued, urging all merchants to comply accordingly. This notice.</p>

<h3>Jue Yuan to Hold a Ceremony for the Presentation of a Bodhi Tree, and the Library Will Open Simultaneously on a Set Date.</h3>
<p>Indian monk Lade, during his visit to China, brought a branch of a "Bodhi Tree" from India. According to Buddhist tradition, Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment under this tree, hence its name, making it exceptionally precious. Monk Lade has specially presented this branch to the owner of Jue Yuan in Shanghai for planting. The garden will hold a presentation ceremony on the 19th of this month, inside the garden on Avenue Haig, and has invited Madam Hardoon to unveil it. Simultaneously, the library will hold its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM. The library has been in preparation for years by Chairman Ye Yuhu, Director Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Yiting, and others, and is now ready. The library's collection includes major Buddhist scriptures and legal codes from the Tang and Song dynasties, as well as valuable scriptures from England, France, and India, all meticulously collected. After the opening, it will be open year-round for public reading. Additionally, a Dharma Treasure Hall is actively being planned. This hall will display collections of Buddhist images, Dharma treasures, and ritual implements from home and abroad throughout history.

<h3>Inventor Yang Ming Invents a Method for Manufacturing Artificial White Sugar and Has Applied to the Academia Sinica for Support.</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Mr. Yang Ming, who last year invented methods for making artificial vegetables, artificial flowers, and artificial kerosene, has not only had his inventions published in newspapers and displayed at the Chamber of Commerce for testing but has also invited social leaders to organize the China Kerosene Company to produce "Elephant Brand" kerosene in China for the benefit of the national economy and the people's livelihood. Mr. Yang, based on recent customs statistics that show the annual value of sugar imports to be 135 million yuan, believes that if no immediate remedy is sought, the leakage is unimaginable. He plans to manufacture artificial white sugar using vegetable protein (the fibrous substance of beets and sugarcane, derived from the artificial vegetable method), flour (a component that helps create the sweet substance in beets, and a similar element to the white powder in sugarcane), and iron oxide (the outer coating of sugarcane, which combines to form the sweet elements of white sugar after sugarcane develops) as the basic raw materials. He intends to invent a method for making artificial white sugar in the near future to supplement the insufficient supply of planted beets and sugarcane. However, due to limited financial resources, he intends to gather comrades to promote the project together and has applied to the Academia Sinica for support.</p>
<h3>The Leven Case Will Be Heard Tomorrow.</h3>
<p>Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of three companies including the American-Oriental Bank, previously filed three civil lawsuits against Mr. Leven in the U.S. Court for China, requesting the court to order Mr. Leven to return the remuneration of 135,000 taels each, along with three years' interest, that he illegally received in 1932 from the American-Oriental Bank, the American Eastern Banking Corporation, and the Probstfield Estate Company. He also filed a criminal lawsuit, alleging that Mr. Leven, along with Mr. Triscott, the manager of the American Eastern Banking Corporation, and Mr. Blanc, the accountant of the company, had misused securities entrusted to them by clients. The first of the civil cases is now scheduled to be heard by Chief Judge Helmick of the U.S. Court at 10:00 AM on Tuesday, the 15th of this week. Mr. Evans, Mr. Leven's lawyer, has arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin to handle the case. Dr. Slater is Mr. He Fu's lawyer, and it is expected that many will attend the hearing that day. The criminal case is scheduled to be heard on October 29th, by which time the first civil case should have concluded. Mr. He Fu has also requested the court to recover the overdraft and unpaid promissory notes owed by Mr. Leven to the American-Oriental Bank, and the amount owed by Mr. Leven to the American Eastern Banking Corporation is even larger. This debt will be heard after the criminal case concludes.</p>

<h3>Fire at Xie Hengxing in Yimiao</h3>
<p>Xie Hengxing store with a shop at No. 4 Yimiao Road in the city suddenly caught fire at 1:00 AM yesterday. Flames shot out in all directions. The 25th patrolman at the location, Shang Xinwen, upon hearing the alarm, immediately reported it to the station and relayed it to the fire brigade. Fire trucks from various districts arrived at the scene and made every effort to extinguish the fire. Since the Central District Fire Brigade was nearby, it was able to put out the fire, preventing a major disaster. Only the goods inside the store were damaged. After investigation, it was found that the store was not insured. The fire starter, Xie Yongfu, was taken to the station and confessed that the fire was caused by carelessness, disrupting order. He was sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Arrested and Assaulted by Workers Demanding Wages</h3>
<p>The Dongfang Steel Fine Factory, located at 750 Kunming Road, had previously declared closure due to financial difficulties. Even the rent was four months in arrears. The landlord filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Consular Court, which ruled that all the factory's assets be auctioned off to cover the debt. However, the workers also had unpaid wages. Yesterday at around 8:00 PM, two former factory workers, Chen Axiang, also known as Dang Shuren, 49 years old, and Wu Xianwen, from Changzhou, 30 years old, claimed that the factory still owed them around 150 yuan in wages each and had not received any news of payment for a long time. They went with their wives, Zhou, 28 years old, and Xu, 27 years old, to demand payment. However, they were stopped by the factory's gatekeeper, Zhang Xiuzhang, from Shandong, 20 years old. This led to a verbal argument, and neither side would give way, eventually resulting in a physical altercation. Zhang Xiuzhang was outnumbered and beaten by the two couples. Nearby patrolmen noticed and rushed to intervene, finding Zhang Xiuzhang spitting blood and clutching his chest in pain. They quickly sent him to the hospital for treatment and took the assailants to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Balcony Collapse Causes Injury and Death; Appeal Filed</h3>

The balcony suddenly collapsed, causing Sanbao and the Portuguese boy to be crushed and killed. Sanbao's sister, A-bao, and brother, Yinsong, were also injured. The Second French Criminal Court prosecuted Zhang Zhaoquan, the manager of the Yongtai Cigarette and Newspaper Store, and related parties. It was reported previously that the plaintiff has appealed the criminal decision to the High Third Branch Court. The High Court, upon receiving the appeal, dispatched Judge Sun Honglin from the Special Investigation Court the day before to summon the appellant, appellee, and witnesses to court for detailed questioning and investigation.

<h3>Negotiation Regarding the Capsizing of the Xiexing Tugboat</h3>
<p>The Xieshun tugboat of the Xiexing Shipping Company, at around 4:00 PM on the 8th of this month in Yangjia Du, Pudong, was towing two barges filled with flower clothes owned by Chen Maolang and Shen A-huo into the Suzhou River (commonly known as the Old Port), intending to turn from the middle of the Huangpu River to enter the port. However, the tugboat driver, while approaching Puxi to enter the port, due to the rapid tide, was unable to support one of the flower clothes barges being towed at the rear, which immediately capsized. All the people on the boat fell into the water and were rescued, but the flower clothes were all lost. Besides those recovered, five pieces are still missing, along with various equipment from the boat. The various expenses including salvage costs are estimated to be around 5-6,000 yuan. Currently, the barge owners are in negotiations with the Xiexing Company, demanding compensation, but no satisfactory resolution has been reached. They have filed a lawsuit in court to seek recovery.</p>

<h3>Mixing Counterfeit Banknotes Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Lin Degen from Haizhou, on the morning of the 2nd of this month at 9:00 AM, snuck into the cigarette and paper shop of Xiao Guangrong, a man from Shandong, at No. 3, Lane 922, East Broadway Road, mixing a counterfeit one-yuan banknote from the China and South Bank. The case was discovered and he was arrested by Chinese detective Yin Zhanqing. Two counterfeit one-yuan banknotes from the China and South Bank and one counterfeit ten-yuan banknote from China were found in his sleeve. He was taken to the Huishan police station and confessed that the counterfeit banknotes belonged to Mr. Hu Wang, who lived on Beijing Jiang Road, Zhabei. The Public Security Bureau subsequently arrested Mr. Hu Wang and brought him back to the police station. They were separately sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Third Criminal Court conducted the trial. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case and requested punishment according to the law. When questioned, Lin Degen insisted that on the morning of his arrest, at around 7:00 AM, he went to Mr. Hu Wang's house, who gave him the three counterfeit banknotes. If he spent ten yuan, he would be paid two yuan, and one yuan would be exchanged for two jiao. When questioned, Mr. Hu Wang claimed that around November of last year, his mistress borrowed ten yuan in Yuan Shikai silver dollars from him. He couldn't get it back, and he argued and fought with his son, leading to resentment and false accusations. He also hired a miscellaneous lawyer to defend him. Lin Degen denied borrowing money and fighting, and Mr. Hu Wang denied having a mistress. Judge Jiang ordered them to be remanded in custody separately, awaiting sentencing.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read an article in today's newspaper about the opening of the Shanghai World Amusement Park, which stated that the park was established to provide relief for flood victims and quoted me as reporting on the preparations. This does not correspond with the facts. The park was established by Mr. Hu, Mr. Shen, and others with invested funds and is purely a commercial organization, distinct from the previous flood relief amusement fair. Whether or not a portion of the profits will be donated to flood relief is not something I can speculate on, as I am not a member of the organization. I only attended the park yesterday as a guest and offered a few words of congratulation. There was no mention of the so-called preparatory process. Fearing future misunderstandings, I hereby send this letter to be published in your column as a statement. Sincerely, Cao Gong, October 13th.</p>

<p>How should my ideals be implemented? This is very complex and profound. It is difficult to explain clearly in a short time. Let me briefly, very briefly, talk about the general outline in concrete terms:</p>
<p>(1) The vast majority of farmers are the sole target for economic improvement.</p>
<p>(2) To improve rural areas, industry should be integrated with agriculture, using local industries as a byproduct of agriculture.</p>
<p>(3) Vigorously restore the water conservancy projects that have historically existed.</p>
<p>(4) Extremely promote research in agricultural chemistry.</p>
<p>(5) Existing light industries should be controlled and subsidized; seek improvement through maintenance rather than expansion.</p>
<p>(6) The state should use its utmost power to establish heavy industries; all heavy industries should be state-owned.</p>
<p>(7) Strive for material self-sufficiency and avoid repeating the mistakes of mercantilism.</p>
<p>The following will provide a brief explanation of each item.</p>
<p>7. Explanations for Items (1) and (2)</p>
<p>Establishing the country through agriculture, establishing the country through industry; these have now become a focal point of discussion on China's economy. Mr. Peng Xuepei advocates: "60% agriculture, 40% industry." Agricultural and industrial progress together (see "Social and Economic Monthly," Volume 2, Issue 5) is a more reasonable approach. I believe that agriculture and industry should not be too clearly separated. Except for heavy industries, which should have specific locations and specialized workers, other light industries can all be used as rural work and agricultural byproducts. I am not copying Kropotkin's old articles on "factory, farm, and workshop"; I have very strong reasons. Integrating industry with agriculture may seem too novel, and yet too outdated. Listeners will certainly suspect that it violates the modern meaning of division of labor and the principles of large-scale centralized production, and reverts to the phenomena of the handicraft era. This is a misunderstanding. I advocate integrating industry with agriculture because I am confident that it is most suitable for the object of China's economy and in line with the latest world trends. The reasons are:</p>
<p>(A) Chinese farmers have too little arable land. According to statistics from the Legislative Yuan: "In 25 provinces, 58 million farming households cultivate an average of 21.5 mu of land per household. Based on five people per household, each farmer only gets a little over 4 mu of land." And the investigation report of the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department states: "Farmers in Zhejiang occupy 1.9 mu of land per person." Arable land is already so narrow. Among them, tenant farmers account for 31% of all farmers (according to the "Shen Bao Yearbook," reprinted from the survey of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute in the 23rd year of the Republic). The land they cultivate is not their own. One can imagine their poverty. Not only can large-scale actions such as mechanized farming not be discussed, but even the very small capital for improving soil seeds is not easy for farmers to raise. Without promoting industrial sideline occupations of agricultural products, rural areas cannot be relieved.</p>
<p>(B) There is little arable land, and the population is large, so farmers have surplus idle time. According to estimates by Professor J.L. Buck of Jinling University: "Farmers can only work 80-90 days a year, and almost three-quarters of their time is completely wasted." Our country does not have machine horsepower to calculate, and even manual labor has strength but no place to sell it. Especially rural women, whose original weaving has been abandoned. Except for giving birth to children and cooking, there is nothing to do all day long. Only a very few places still have women's work such as silk weaving, mat weaving, straw hat making, and lace making. Most rural women are simply outside of productive work. Those who eat are many, and those who produce are few. How can they not be poor! Without finding a way to integrate industry with agriculture, there is no way to use farmers' idle time, and there is no way to enable rural women, who account for half of the population, to engage in productive work.</p>
<p>(C) Find ways to utilize natural power. Wind power, water power, so that scientific utilization and mechanization extend to the countryside. In the countryside, there were old water-powered rice mills and paper mills. The mechanical group was clumsy, and the effectiveness was not great. The use of wind power is extremely rare. In all places where there is no electricity, methods should be devised locally to make full use of natural power. The cost is light, and there is no need to purchase from outside. Starting from simple scientific machinery, the rural atmosphere is opened up. Naturally, farmers will slowly take the road of using scientific machinery. I once thought that in windy places on the coast and in the mountains, wind power could be used to generate electricity and store it in storage batteries for gradual use. When there is no wind, work will not stop. I heard that Soviet Russia already has this method (see "Scientific China," Volume 5, Issue 1). It coincides with my ideal. I hope that electrical engineers will do their best to research. If it works, electrification across the country will be easier to achieve. Steam engines and hydropower generation are very costly. At the beginning, it is especially difficult to use all the electricity. Wind power generation may be a simple way to promote electrification.</p>
<p>(D) Gradually change handicrafts into small mechanical industries, and change domestic industries into small factories. The economic system of the family gradually integrates with modern material civilization. The small diesel engine mill mentioned above is a good example.</p>
<p>(E) The capital of rural small factories may be raised by investors or loaned by the government. The essence of cooperation should be used. In addition to capital interest and worker wages, there are also profits, which are limited to improving or expanding the business of the factory or local public use. It is necessary to achieve production by using goods and not production for making money, so as to avoid the poisonous effects of capitalism spreading to the countryside and causing competitive and fraudulent thinking habits.</p>
<p>(F) Small factories do not harm the principle of division of labor. The original production of each rural area is different, and the products of small factories naturally vary accordingly. They can be exchanged with each other, implicitly containing the meaning of division of labor. It is not "one person's body, prepared by a hundred workers." However, extremely industrialized factories, even a single screw or iron bar, can cause workers to work for a lifetime, turning them into machines, with no sense of being a living person. This is something that rural factories do not have.</p>
<p>(G) For factories with a wider range of products, the government should divide several rural areas into one region; and set up a model factory in a more central location. The purpose of this factory is not to compete with small factories for profit, but to plan ways for small factories to improve and to make them imitate. Because each factory scattered in rural areas cannot understand the world's new inventions and the changes in transportation and sales at any time. This model factory researches and invents, and guides them at any time on how to improve so that the manufactured products are not backward and inferior. The model factory is the mentor of each factory in the region. If a method of improvement is invented, or the guidance to each factory is very developed, the government will give special rewards. In this way, although the factories are separated and scattered, they still have a spirit of unity and no disadvantages of being scattered and backward. As for the joint transportation and sales of each factory, and sales cooperation, of course, it is a proper meaning, and the government should plan and guide it early.</p>
<p>(H) Modern large-scale production and centralized management are nothing more than making products excellent and costs low. However, because of capital profits, competition has led to overproduction, causing a world panic. Bankruptcies and unemployment have been going on for four or five years, and there is still no clue. (The so-called economic improvement at this time is due to the vigorous repair of war preparations in various countries and the great development of military industry; it is not that the panic has been reduced. One can understand this by looking at the world's trade statistics and the situation of various disputes in the United States.) Those who ask for industrialization must not read dead books and follow the wrong path of others. Moreover, the situation mentioned above cannot be followed at all. If the factories are scattered in rural areas and guided by model factories, the products may not be very good, but they will not be decadent. Raw materials are taken locally, and the cost is naturally low; farmers use spare time and unemployed rural women to work, and wages are naturally low; rural eating, drinking, and living are more frugal than in cities in all aspects, and expenses are naturally saved. The four characters of low cost can be achieved without large-scale production. To resist the cheap dumping of imperialism, I am afraid this is the only way. We cannot use Gandhi's hand-spinning machine to resist British goods, but setting up rural factories and exchanging products everywhere may also achieve the same effect as Gandhi.</p>
<p>(I) The establishment of rural factories should be handled by local governments, who should recruit knowledgeable and experienced talents to establish a "Agricultural and Industrial Economic Committee." Based on the local situation, the types of industries should be selected, capital should be raised, and the collection of raw materials and the transportation and sales of products should be specified, and the people should be persuaded to handle it. At the beginning, the scale may be simple and small, and the investment should be light. As long as you take this road, it will naturally gradually develop.</p>
<p>The reasons mentioned above for integrating industry with agriculture are mostly from a positive perspective. From a negative perspective, let's talk about preventing abuses.</p>
<p>(J) Now, in the era of three-dimensional warfare and the prevalence of air attacks, destroying resources is the primary task of attacking the enemy. If all factories are set up in large cities, and our national defense is not fully equipped, just a few large bombers can sweep everything clean in a few hours. How dangerous is this? If the factories are scattered in rural areas, the enemy will not find a concentrated point for bombing, and naturally, they will be much safer. Even if several places are bombed, it is not a total loss.</p>
<p>(K) Labor-capital disputes are inevitable after the development of industry. Italy's professional group method cannot be imitated by our country for a while (mentioned above). Only by using cooperative methods to run rural factories, the factory owners and workers are all one, and there is no distinction between labor and capital, so how can disputes arise. This is the best way to avoid labor-capital problems caused by capitalism.</p>
<p>(L) Urban factories often invest hundreds of thousands to millions. When it's good, it's a tool for profit; when it's bad, it all becomes scrap copper and rotten iron. In the environment we are in now, without national power to protect us, and with the economic imperialism pressing so urgently, the chances of failure are greater than the chances of success. Even if we are fortunate enough to encounter an opportunity (during the European War), it is only for the extravagant pleasures of a few capitalists. If we fail unfortunately, with our country's capital being so weak, it will cause financial panic. Unemployed workers have no money for food and clothing, which is even more pitiful. Wandering in the city, it is inevitable to brew danger. The road of capitalism has not yet been taken, and the abuses of capitalism have all been received. Rural factories only invest thousands to tens of thousands. Failure in several places will not have a major impact. The workers are originally farmers who lack sideline occupations and live a little worse, but there is still agriculture to retreat to, so they will not wander without a home. For the epidemic of panic and unemployment, rural factories can be regarded as a kind of vaccine.</p>
<p>(M) "Reviving the countryside" and "returning to the countryside" are the most fashionable slogans at the moment, but talents are still crowded in cities. The vanity of aiming high and the comfort of fearing labor and suffering certainly make a group of young people unwilling to serve in the countryside. However, the countryside only has old-fashioned agriculture, which is too monotonous and cannot accommodate talents. On the one hand, the countryside is not short of outstanding talents, but simple agriculture binds them, making them have no opportunity to practice and improve, burying many talents. If factories are set up everywhere in rural areas, those who go to the countryside will not only be useful for those who study agriculture, but also for various scientific talents. And smart talents in the countryside also have the opportunity to practice industry and science, so that talents are not crowded or buried. The problem of college students' careers may be solved in this way. However, I very much hope to bring the knowledge of the city to the countryside, and I am extremely afraid that the extravagant and lazy customs of the city will harm the countryside. Various disinfecting prescriptions must also be prepared in advance.</p>
<p>(8) Explanations for Items (3) and (4)</p>
<p>Integrating industry with agriculture and rural factories have been said so much, but it only gives farmers more opportunities to work, and makes factories a sideline for the people. It does not talk about the problems of agriculture itself. Agricultural problems are naturally complicated, and the most important and urgent thing is the water conservancy project, which has been passed down for thousands of years and is called the Asian mode of production by European scholars. From the ditch system to the guiding of rivers, large and small are not left out. Historically, great achievements have been recorded. Since the corruption of the Qing Dynasty's politics and the civil war that has lasted for more than 20 years in the Republic of China, the most glorious page of our nation in history, water conservancy, has been abandoned and not discussed. Every year, there are floods and droughts, and every year, there are famines, which have trapped the vast majority of farmers in the country in a desperate situation. Those who starve to death starve to death, those who commit suicide commit suicide, and those who flee flee. Saving the dying and helping the wounded cannot be done, so how can we talk about construction and development. The integration of industry with agriculture and rural factories mentioned above, under that state, is the same as Emperor Hui of Jin's saying to give meat to a hungry people, it is all nonsense. Until recently, the government has gradually paid attention to water conservancy. Opening canals in Shaanxi and Sui and dredging the Huai River in Jiangsu have seen some achievements, but due to insufficient funds, the plan has been reduced and reduced, and the project has been reduced and reduced again. On the one hand, there is much talk about water conservancy, and on the other hand, there are great floods, droughts, and famines, forming an extremely contradictory phenomenon. Of course, water conservancy projects cannot be completed in a short period of time, nor can they be effective in a short period of time. However, the government's allocation of water conservancy funds is too small. Within the budget, there is no special water conservancy fund. Only several hundred thousand to several million are allocated from the cotton and wheat loan (allocated to the Economic Commission for construction projects) within the relief fund, and the rest are pushed to the local government to complete the matter. Last year, the Central Political Conference resolved to unify the administrative case of water conservancy, with the decision that "in the general budget, starting from the 23rd year of the Republic of China, an annual central water conservancy project fee of 5 million yuan will be listed, which will be claimed and managed by the Economic Commission on a monthly basis." With our country's land being so large, the number of waterways being so many, and the abandonment of water conservancy being so long and far away, what can be done with a mere 6 million yuan? The Jianghuai River transport can cost almost tens of millions as soon as it moves. The government will not say water conservancy if it does not say it. If it says water conservancy, it will never be a trivial matter to deal with casually. It must make a great determination, raise great funds, and start great work to make the rural areas across the country see some results. All kinds of public bonds have been issued a lot, but there is not a single bond for water conservancy, which is the economic foundation of the whole country. When it comes to water conservancy, issuing 100 million or 50 million public bonds is not too much. Because this is completely profitable. Moreover, every basket, every hoe, every piece of wood, and every stone are mostly taken from within the country, and there is no need to purchase foreign goods. If we use 500 million or 100 million to do water conservancy on a large scale, without corrupt people inserting themselves in it, seeking truth from facts, then when construction starts, millions to tens of millions of disaster victims can be supported. After the project is completed, tens of millions of hectares of arable land can be opened up, and agricultural production can be increased by one or two times. The minimum limit is to eliminate or reduce the current disasters by more than half. Can't the 500 million or 100 million public bonds recoup the capital? In other words, other public bonds are not suitable for issuance, only water conservancy public bonds can be issued. Without water conservancy in place, the 30 million farmers, who account for the largest part of the country's population, have no way out. It is already obvious that the country's agricultural products are not enough for the country's use. It is a pity that we have nothing else besides agricultural products. And when will we be able to create other things? I'm afraid the days are gone. In addition to water conservancy, we should first stabilize the rural foundation before thinking about improvement methods. What else can be done?</p>
<p>If we can do water conservancy on a large scale, the arable land will naturally increase, and agricultural production will naturally increase. However, during this period of national seclusion, as long as agricultural products are sold a little more, people will be jealous. The United States started planting tung trees, and in the British Parliament, there were several accusations against my export of egg yolks, whites, and meats. Even if we increase production, if we have more than enough for our own use, and exchange goods with others, we will either lower the value or restrict the quantity. Lowering the value is indirectly squeezing our labor. Restricting the quantity is to make our products unable to be exchanged. We possess these surplus agricultural products in vain, just like American farmers using wheat to feed livestock, or like Brazil burning coffee. Producing more but not being able to use it still cannot improve the lives of farmers and solve the poverty of farmers. Our goal is not to commercialize agricultural products, but to achieve self-sufficiency and improve our living standards. If agricultural products are commercialized, the lives of ordinary farmers must rely on international trade. If other countries have panic or war changes, we will suffer. The historical failure of sericulture is a lesson in the commercialization of agricultural products. Not only is my country not striving for success, failure is inevitable. Even Japan, which once dominated for a while, has suffered the pain of falling silkworm prices. They boast that weaving is the national vein, but ultimately the vein of weaving cannot withstand it, and they must seek another lifeline. We must not envy the commercialization of agricultural products, this unreasonable development. Instead, we must increase our own production and improve our own lives.</p>
<p>Agricultural products are simple, unlike industrial manufactured products, which are convenient for daily use and endless enjoyment. How can we improve our lives with simple agricultural products? Then we must rely on agricultural chemistry.</p>
<p>Dr. William J. Hale of the United States: "Natural mineral deposits will eventually be exhausted. All kinds of raw materials used in a country's chemical factory can abandon mineral deposits, oil wells, and other natural sources, and obtain them from agriculture. In the future, agriculture will definitely not only be able to supply food like it is now. A large part of the agricultural products must be engaged in Synthetic Chemistry, using crops as raw materials to supply us humans with all the materials for daily clothing, housing, and construction, as well as fuel and other necessities."</p>
<p>Dr. Hale cited the example of Internal combustion Engines being modified to burn alcohol. Internal combustion engines only need to change the carbon compound restrictor and mix 10% or 15% of pure alcohol in ordinary gasoline to increase the combustion power of gasoline. Alcohol is made from starch, and corn, which contains the most starch, can extract 30 pounds of alcohol per bushel. The remaining 26 pounds of residue are still good feed for livestock. The total amount of alcohol produced in the United States each year is about 100 million gallons. If 10% alcohol is added to gasoline, 1.6 billion gallons will be needed. The current number of alcohol manufacturing plants must be increased more than tenfold, and the raw material corn must also be increased to 700 million bushels. If 50% alcohol is added to gasoline, the United States will need 4 billion bushels of corn each year, which is more than twice the current corn production in the United States. It is only feared that it is not enough, why should it be too much.</p>
<p>This is to find a way out for surplus agricultural products. However, the United States produces the largest amount of gasoline in the world. Using more alcohol will inevitably reduce the use of gasoline. Oil merchants will definitely object. Dr. Hale's views may not be entirely suitable in the United States, but they are most suitable in China! My country currently does not produce gasoline. Water, carbon, and alcohol are being tested. And some people have invented artificial gasoline using vegetable oil and other raw materials, which is also being tested. If alcohol can really be used as a substitute for gasoline, then we can widely plant potatoes and other raw materials, which can produce more than American corn. Studying alcohol production to make the price of alcohol lower than gasoline will not only have countless benefits in transportation and industry, but also make national defense much more secure.</p>
<p>In addition, the manufacture of artificial rubber and bakelite also requires agricultural products. Various agricultural chemical manufacturing experiments that will be successful include using corn stalks to manufacture alcohol, and using similar raw materials such as rice bran, bran, etc., Xylose and other agricultural wastes to manufacture fuels and coal gas. AlphaCelulose is extracted from sugarcane dregs. The United States Department of Agriculture's Industrial Agricultural Production Division assists in using straw and sugarcane dregs to make building and insulating boards for commercial use (all of the above are from the 14th and 15th issues of the 12th year of the Rural New Report). Agricultural chemistry is currently the most important thing in the United States, and it is changing with each passing day. As Dr. Hale said: All kinds of raw materials in factories are taken from agriculture. In the future, perhaps this new fact will be judged. Our country must catch up, there must be agricultural chemistry, and then the increase in agricultural products can improve our lives. And then rural factories will have meaning.</p>
<p>9. Inventions for Items (5), (6), and (7)</p>
<p>The above has explained the general direction. If we can really do this, in three or five years, the lives of farmers will gradually stabilize, and rural factories will have a clue. Can our country's economy be considered to have embarked on the road to improvement? Still not. Because modern countries are competing too fiercely, a country's economy must achieve self-sufficiency to be considered complete. In peacetime, it can exchange resources, and in wartime, it can be self-sufficient. If my country builds rural factories on a large scale, the factory machinery and refined raw materials (such as chemical drugs) must still rely on people. We are still far from self-sufficiency. The strength of a country and the foundation of national industrialization all lie in heavy industry. My country's heavy industry can be considered non-existent at all (not paying attention to heavy industry but advocating industrialization is a characteristic of my country's foreign doctors). In peacetime, we can still rely on imports, but when something happens, there is no way at all. Regardless of the needs of agriculture or industry, there is no place to settle. However, the small-scale farming agriculture in the country requires very few mechanical raw materials, so it is relatively unimportant. Light industry lacks the supply of heavy industry products, and it is difficult to operate. If the diesel engine has no diesel, the engine becomes waste. If the machine has no steel parts, the machine becomes waste. A country without heavy industry cannot talk about industrialization. Even the rural factories mentioned above have an unstable foundation. To achieve self-sufficiency, the first step is to relieve the vast majority of farmers, and the second step is to establish heavy industry. The two can be carried out simultaneously. As for the existing various light industries, they are desolate and scattered, and most of them are struggling on the line of death. To investigate the reasons for their decline: let's put aside the internal diseases, such as backward technology, mismanagement, and shortage of funds, for the time being, and focus on the external situation. Foreign pressure accounts for about 70%, and the decline of rural areas accounts for 30%. Because most of the domestic consumers are farmers, when the farmers' consumption power is strong, they can take advantage of the gap after foreign pressure to share a piece of the pie. Now most of the farmers across the country are starving on their stomachs. Where is the consumption power to enjoy industrial products? The smaller the sales, the more forceful the foreign goods (including imports and foreign-owned factories) rush to sell, and the greater the pressure. Chinese-owned factories have no room to breathe. Even if there are no internal diseases, they can only barely survive, where can they develop. Therefore, if the vast number of national farmers, who have the largest consumption, have not been relieved slightly, then light industry is an incurable disease. We see that the Cotton Industry Control Association has been doing its best to think of ways for yarn factories for more than two years, but yarn factories are still sinking and are getting worse year by year. I don't know if those who are talking about industrialization now have investigated the current situation of factories. Just saying that England is like this and the United States is like that is like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger, which is completely irrelevant. To industrialize, we must start with heavy industry, light industry is useless. However, the existing light industry has invested a lot of money, and there are also a lot of employed workers. For the sake of the national economy, it is naturally impossible to put it aside and not talk about it. While running rural factories, we must maintain the existing light industry. Naturally, we must carefully calculate the production and consumption to prevent them from conflicting and to make them mutually utilize. The maintenance methods are nothing more than control and subsidies, advancing in both directions. Regarding control: (1) Merger and union of capital; (2) Organization of trade associations, must be strong and powerful; (3) Those with too old machinery should be stopped; (4) Those with corrupt management should be intervened and corrected, those who do not violate the law should be punished; (5) Regulate labor and capital, so as not to cause unnecessary oblique disputes; (6) No excessive distribution of dividends is allowed; (7) Rectify raw materials and severely punish the malpractice of adulteration; (8) New factories are not allowed to be added unless necessary. Regarding subsidies: (1) Correct the tax regulations so that foreign merchants do not have an advantage; (The current unified tax rules, cotton yarn rolls, have too few grades, the burden on low-quality goods is heavy, and the burden on high-quality goods is light, which is beneficial to foreign merchants and detrimental to Chinese factories.) (2) Measure and lend funds; (3) Exempt raw material donations and taxes, and reduce freight; (4) Give considerable bonuses to those who are excellent in technology management and pass the exam; (5) Transportation and sales must be extremely convenient; (6) Those who use the power of public facilities (such as electricity from government-run power plants) should be given a special price reduction; (7) ) Industries related to national defense (such as cement, chemical fertilizers, machines, etc.) should be given subsidies. If we do this, the existing light industry should be able to struggle to get out of the death line. However, if the consumption power of farmers has not recovered and the sales of manufactured products are not smooth, it is impossible to move towards prosperity. The problem is not in the light industry itself, and it should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>If my country wants to industrialize, it must establish heavy industry. Steel, gasoline, basic chemical industry, power machinery, hydropower generation, locomotives, and shipbuilding, these must be run with large capital. I advocate state-owned ones, not because I am afraid of capital concentration and merchant patents. In fact, my country's industrialists and businessmen do not have this great courage, and everything is started later, and losses are inevitable at the beginning. The steel and gasoline produced in my country, and the locomotives and machinery made by ourselves, will definitely not be as cheap and applicable as imported goods. It must go through a considerable period of time and several improvements and progress before it can be on par with them. However, we cannot be greedy for convenience and rely on imported goods forever. At the beginning, this debt must be borne by the state. Perhaps we will encounter an opportunity where foreign goods do not come, and we can avoid compensation, which is a stroke of luck. If the country has no capital, it can borrow foreign capital. However, heavy industry is related to the life and death of the country, and foreign capital should not be borrowed for economic purposes. Only bond raising or borrowing machinery and materials can be used. Joint ventures or franchises must not be used. To establish heavy industry, there are thousands of things to do. Of course, we must first organize a committee, network experts and people who are familiar with the domestic economic situation, and first arrange the order and formulate a detailed plan. We don’t need to copy the names of five years and three years. As long as we handle it in stages, it is practical. Under today's international situation, can we be allowed to complete the construction of heavy industry leisurely? The problem is still under consideration. "A country in heaven and earth must have something to stand with." Since heavy industry is an essential element for establishing a country, it must be run no matter what. As for success or failure, we only ask to do our best to deal with it.</p>
<p>If we really follow this path, agriculture and industry will advance together. We only take self-sufficiency as our goal. If there is surplus in production, we will exchange goods with foreign countries. The intention is to improve the living standards of the people, and we must never dump them abroad and compete with others for the market. The disadvantages of commercializing agricultural products have been discussed above. If our production depends entirely on foreign markets, then domestic prices will not be stable, and everything will be involved in the world vortex, which will be chaotic and endless. Moreover, it will arouse the jealousy of others, sell our own labor cheaply, and the absorption of cash and expansion of power by merchants will only lead to imperialist struggles and killings. At the end, there will be a panic, and everyone will only be able to look at each other and be unable to save it. Why should we follow their footsteps? We have absorbed material civilization, and we still want to develop our ideal of great harmony and embark on the road of evolution. We will definitely not follow in the footsteps of others and replay the old dramas of history.</p>
<p>10. Conclusion</p>
<p>I have said a lot. In summary, to improve China's economy, we must think about the farmers, who account for the vast majority of the country's people, and plan methods that are truly in line with the national conditions and the times. Integrating industry with agriculture and rural factories is the main theme of this speech. Vigorously developing water conservancy and studying agricultural chemistry are the key points for promoting the main theme. Maintaining the existing light industry and establishing heavy industry are to take into account the current situation and the basic foundation of the country in the future. However, there are still two preconditions that have not been mentioned. One is finance and the other is finance. Finance is the source of capital turnover, and finance is the key to the country's income and expenditure. In particular, tax policy is closely related to the national economy. These two problems are too broad and too complex. Once involved, they cannot be explained clearly in a short period of time. Let's ask for advice another day. (End)</p>

<h3>Zhu Bailu's Eight Characters</h3>
<p>— Heaven Creates Me</p>
<p>Zhu Bailu's family precepts, though spoken at great length, ultimately boil down to only two sentences that are the true essence of the precepts: "Know your place and accept your fate, follow the times and listen to heaven," these eight big characters. "Know your place" refers to one's capacity. For example, with a balance scale, your own weight can only be accurate up to one thousand grams. If you try to exceed it even slightly, it's excessive and definitely too much to bear. If you use a weight of ten grams to weigh something that weighs nine grams, you'll naturally feel it's too light and can be increased. But if you add two grams, it becomes too heavy on that side. So, when it's at nine grams and nine decigrams, you can only add one centigram, which is sufficient. Although it may not be stable for a moment, if you patiently wait for one or two seconds, you'll see the difference. If you're flustered and hurried, with hands busy and feet scrambling, sometimes subtracting and sometimes adding, it will never be balanced. "Accept your fate" is like receiving an order. Even a military order can be disobeyed, but the mandate of heaven cannot be resisted. Being born into this world, as a woman or a man, is the mandate of heaven. After being born, parents cannot bear to let you die, so they clothe and feed you, ensuring you exist in this world as a person. This is the order of your parents. Parents cannot clothe and feed me for life, so I find my own clothing and food and use it to clothe and feed my parents. Therefore, I accept the orders of others and dare not resist. This is how a child is to a father, a younger brother to an elder brother, and a subject to a ruler. Even if you don't want to, you can only accept it peacefully. Otherwise, it will be of no benefit to you and even cause harm. Since you cannot escape from the world, it's better to be content with your circumstances. A gentleman resides in ease and awaits his fate. Ease means simplicity. If a person stands on even ground and does simple things, without taking risks to seek luck, then they can live peacefully and without resentment. "Follow the times" means the seasons of heaven. Heaven has four seasons, changing between two extremes. At the summer solstice, yin is born, and at the winter solstice, yang is born. When severe cold and intense heat come, I cannot resist them, so I can only accept them. If I don't follow and resist, such as anticipating what will happen in the future, since death has existed since ancient times, why struggle? Even Shun's parents only followed it, and because of this, he became known for his filial piety. Yao passed the empire to Shun, also because he could follow the times. Heaven created me originally for the purpose of creation. Tilling the fields to eat, drilling wells to drink. The tools for tilling and drilling all come from human creation. If others can create things, but I cannot, I should be ashamed. However, the nature heaven has given me is clumsy and not skillful. I can only use the strength of my hands and feet to avoid hunger and cold. Therefore, I exert my efforts in the fields and wells to ensure I have enough to eat and drink. This is what I should do. As for the fields yielding poor harvests and the wells running dry, I can only leave it to heaven. However, human effort can turn the tide. Rising at sunrise and resting at sunset, exerting effort in the fields, then a hundred acres of land may not be completely barren, and nine families sharing a well may not be completely dry. If they are, then neighbors can help each other to share what they have and lack, which is enough to sustain life. Therefore, all people must have a heart of benevolence. Benevolence means that besides myself, there are others whom I must consider. Therefore, the character for benevolence is actually made up of two people, unlike the character for "big," which is made up of one person. Two people make "big," which also means that the power of more than one person, when two or more people work together, their ability can create things and benefit people, which is no different from the ability of heaven. Waking up at dawn, I wrote this freely, using the fresh air of the morning as a way to calm my mind. Whether it's skillful or clumsy, I don't care.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Zhiqian was speaking as he headed directly towards Jia Duocai's house. Wanting to give Jia Duocai a heads-up, he called out "Mr. Jia" from afar. There was a reply from inside the house. He said, "Mr. Jia has gone out with a friend. Who is it?" Upon hearing this voice, Zhiqian's heroic spirit was dampened by more than half. This was Yueying's voice. If he reported to her that his grandmother was eagerly awaiting him and was about to die, he would immediately run out. If he waited for Duocai to return, she might think he had ulterior motives, causing unnecessary trouble. Therefore, after calling out "Mr. Jia," he stopped in his tracks, unable to move forward. Yueying, who was answering from inside the house, hadn't seen anyone come over, so she stretched her head out to take a look. When she saw Zhiqian standing far away, she was also taken aback. However, since she lived in the same house with Jia Duocai and saw guests every day, her demeanor had become much more poised. She wasn't as afraid of men anymore. So, she composed herself, smiled, and said, "Oh! It's Mr. Cheng. Is there something you need?" Zhiqian swallowed a mouthful of air and, feigning a smile, said, "There is something, but Mr. Jia isn't home, so what I have to say..." As he spoke, he scratched his head several times and smiled, "It's nothing really. Mrs. Jia, please sit in the house for a while. I'll find someone to talk to you." With that, he quickly ran towards the back of Little Western Paradise. Sure enough, the old Mrs. Zhu was still sitting under the door frame. When Sister-in-law Hu saw him, she immediately pointed wildly in that direction and said, "He's here! He's here!" The old lady tremblingly extended a finger, pointing in that direction, and, grabbing her daughter-in-law's hand, stood up and said, "He... he... is he here?" (338)</p>
<h3>Mr. Yun Tieqiao's Remaining Works</h3>
<p>— Gu Yushi</p>
<p>My late teacher, Mr. Yun, whose given name was Tieqiao, was a Continued Academician. His lofty writings carried the Dao, and he was a national-level healer. His students and followers traveled from afar, and Mr. Yun always patiently guided them. I, Yushi, was honored to be in his company, able to follow him morning and night, and personally learn the ways of medicine. He did not consider me unteachable and molded me. He revealed the true secrets of the essence of Chinese medicine, including the study of forms and functions, and the points that should be emphasized in treating patients. The two words "forms and functions" come from the Inner Canon. This kind of knowledge can be called the unique knowledge of Chinese medicine, and very few know it. Contemporary students actually misinterpret "forms and functions" as physical shapes. My teacher's learning had roots, his insights were unique, he expounded ancient meanings, and investigated subtle details. Those who are not well-versed in learning cannot even hope to catch up with him. In his later years, he was particularly skilled in calligraphy. For years, due to a wrist ailment, he could not write, and all his calligraphy was done by someone else holding the brush. When I graduated, my teacher was still writing with a strong hand, and I was rewarded with a seven-character couplet. Unexpectedly, the news of his passing came quickly. Caressing his calligraphy, I don't know where my tears should flow. Sitting and facing his remaining treasures, remembering his teachings, how dare I keep them secret? I respectfully publish them in the newspaper to share with those who appreciate them and to express my sorrow.</p>

<p>Even the towels used by the Empress Dowager for bathing show a general sense of extravagance! The towels are edged with apricot-yellow silk thread, forming a neat border, and the center is embroidered with a delicate coiled dragon of the same color; the bright yellow, against the snowy white background, is truly moving! I think sending these bath towels to the exhibition at the fair would be a fine piece of craftsmanship!</p>
<p>When the Empress Dowager was seated on the low table, the four maids were already busy preparing. The Empress Dowager automatically took off her upper garment, exposing her upper body. Although I didn't necessarily want to admire her body, since it was already revealed in front of me, I couldn't help but take a look; this look surprised me greatly. Because I knew the Empress Dowager's age long ago, I thought that a body of an old lady like this must have no beauty to look at, and all I could see must be just a layer of dry, shriveled skin. Who knew that the Empress Dowager's body was not like that at all! Her figure was originally very beautiful, neither too fat nor too thin, the flesh color was extraordinarily fresh and tender, white and without any scars, and it looked very smooth. This kind of body is usually only found in girls around twenty years old; unexpectedly, I saw it on an old lady at this moment, truly a miracle! At that time, I couldn't help but think to myself, if the Empress Dowager's face could be made to look younger, combined with her such a tender and delicate body, she could surely be selected as the most beautiful woman in the palace.

<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3>Mussolini and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Due to the increasingly tense situation in Italy, Mussolini, known as a world eccentric, the creator of Fascism, one of the three major dictators in Europe, and the Italian Prime Minister, has become more well-known to the world. Mussolini is only in his fifties. Currently, in addition to being the Prime Minister, he also serves as the Minister of the Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Corporations, and Minister of the Army. The burden of political affairs is such that perhaps there is no other prominent figure in the world like him? However, although his work is very complex and busy, he is unwilling to do anything carelessly, regardless of the size of the matter. This spirit is indeed worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>In his early years, his origins were also very poor. His father opened a hotel in the countryside, and his mother had passed away early. His stepmother was a widow who brought some savings with her when she married his father. Before Mussolini achieved success, he had also traveled to France, Austria, Switzerland, and other places to live a wandering life. When he returned from failure, he had no money left. It was not until later that he went to Milan to edit newspapers and organize praise and support groups, occasionally engaging in praise and support ideology. The Fascist party he now leads was born from the late stage of praise and support ideology. On October 20, 1922, he led 100,000 party members and stormed into Rome. In this coup, he seized political power in Italy, and the Italian King immediately invited him to serve as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>After seizing power, Mussolini advocated adopting strong policies to benefit the people and actively build a "New Italy." Indeed, after he took office, Italy's national strength rose steadily. Originally, after the end of the Great War, Italy's position in the international community had already leaped into the ranks of the five major powers, and now, after Mussolini's improvement, it is naturally even stronger. However, at a time when a depressed atmosphere enveloped the world, Italy was naturally no exception, so the economic situation was also very difficult. Mussolini is not only resolute in handling affairs, but also very frugal in his daily life. Whether it is the furnishings of his home or his personal clothing, there is no trace of extravagance. Therefore, his children also have this kind of legacy. He has a considerable love for various sports, and in winter, he is most happy to go skiing in the mountains. He can drive both cars and airplanes himself.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mussolini, we must think of his wife; indeed, this lady can be considered the most virtuous wife. Although her husband is the Prime Minister of a country, her frugality is still unexpected. The clothes she usually wears are simple and unadorned. If you didn't recognize her face, you would think she was an ordinary country woman. She does not live in Rome but lives in a villa in the suburbs of Rome, and it is even more difficult to get to Rome. In social settings, people have never seen her face. Occasionally, when she comes to Rome, she is in a hurry to leave, and her movements are very secretive, never willing to announce them in advance. Therefore, in Italian newspapers, news about the Prime Minister's wife's daily activities is rarely seen.</p>
<p>In fact, Mussolini and his wife are truly a couple who share hardships together, and they are also half-siblings! Didn't I say above that Mussolini's stepmother was a widow? This widow had a daughter at home. When Mussolini's father was running a hotel in the countryside, a little girl often came to the hotel to help - it was the virtuous lady now! At that time, Mussolini also lived in this hotel, and the two of them grew up together, developing a love relationship. In Mussolini's history, although there is no official biography at present, this may be said to be the most romantic page. After they got married, Mussolini traveled around, initially hitting walls on all sides, but when he returned from failure, his wife always comforted and encouraged him in every possible way. Therefore, Mussolini was able to avoid being pessimistic, not giving up, and struggling forward bravely, finally achieving his current position. His virtuous wife also contributed half the effort.</p>

<h3>Grain: Arrival of New Early Rice Causes a Sharp Fall of Three Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various sources arrived with only thirty-odd numbers (approximately 6,000 shi of goods). Sales in the market were not frequent, and wholesalers were even more slack. Only a few hundred bags were processed, and the market trend immediately declined. As a result, the prices of thick early rice and thin broken rice all depreciated by about a jiao. The prices of new thin rice like Shenzhong Baige also fell by one or two jiao. Furthermore, the supply of thick new early rice was relatively strong, causing a sharp fall of three jiao. The prices of new pointed rice of various colors like Doyang were also difficult to maintain, following closely behind by a small jiao. Only the changing Yin Yuan had no major gains or losses.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-six or seven numbers arrived from various routes along the river. The market sales of various goods, such as broken rice, early rice, white rice, thin rice, dense seedlings, and Baige, were weak and light. Market prices for broken rice fell by a few fen to nearly a jiao, and the price of new early rice fell by about a small jiao. The price of thin rice was stable. The price of Kiln Seed Baige was slightly inflated, and the prices of Yang Point and Du Point were steady. The price of Bu Point and Ke Point was tight by a few fen, and the prices of all other goods were steady.</p>

<h3>Metals: Pure Antimony Exports Halted, Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>Pure Antimony rose sharply to 800 yuan, but exports were halted yesterday and the day before. It is now estimated at 760 yuan, a small decrease of 40 yuan from before. There were large transactions, and it can still be purchased cheaply for another 10 or 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Italian Twin-Linked Tinplate has risen from 34 yuan per unit. Yesterday, printing factories, canneries, and others were still continuing to search for it, so asking prices are expected to increase by another yuan. The public asking price is generally stable at 35 yuan, with an asking price of 50 to 60 boxes being offered.</p>

<h3>National Games, Day Four: Women's Track and Field Sets New National Records Again; Peng Yongxin's Javelin and Qian Xingsu's Hurdles Break Records; Player Eligibility Dispute Comes to an End, Hao and Xu's Qualifications Revoked</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the National Games. The weather was beautiful, and because it was Sunday, the crowds were more congested than on the second and third days, more than doubling in size. The number of people in the track and field area was around 20,000 to 30,000. New national records were again discovered in men's and women's track and field, totaling two items: Qian Xingsu's 80-meter women's hurdles and Peng Yongxin's javelin. Shanghai holds an absolute advantage in the three track and field championships and is highly confident in winning the championships. The women's championship is already certain. The ball game matches are becoming increasingly intense, the martial arts competitions are very exciting, and the dispute over player eligibility has come to an end. At last night's joint meeting of the competition and judging committees, it was resolved to revoke the qualifications of Shanghai players Xu Heng and Hao Chunde.</p>
<h3>The Women's Javelin Final: Peng Yongxin Breaks the National Record with One Throw: Fifty Meters Two Seven Five — Ao Huaming Emerges as an Unexpected Star in Second Place, Li Shiming Makes a Cameo Appearance and Takes Third</h3>
<p>The men's javelin final was full of talent, and the creation of a new record was expected. Peng Yongxin, the champion of the previous tournament, was determined to retain the championship. After the competition began, most of the players could not cross the 40-meter line, so their throws were not measured. Only Peng Yongxin, representing Beijing, threw beyond 50 meters in one throw, exceeding his personal national record of 50 meters and 19 centimeters. In the second week of trial throws, Li Shiming, Zhou Changxing, Ao Huaming, and others all exceeded 45 meters. In the third trial throws, none of the athletes improved. In the final week, Zhang Lingjia, Wang Xuewu, Guo Jie, and others were eliminated, and those who qualified for the final were Peng Yongxin, Li Shiming, Ao Huaming, Zhou Changxing, Tang Xianzhu, and Wu Huanqing, six people. Peng Yongxin did not improve in the last three throws, relying on his first throw to win the title. The official results and championship were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Peng Yongxin (Beijing) 50.275 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>(2) Ao Huaming (Guangdong) 49.86 meters</p>
<p>(3) Li Shiming (Liaoning) 47.23 meters</p>
<p>(4) Zhou Changxing (Liaoning) 46.025 meters</p>
<p>(5) Tang Xianzhu (Shanghai) 45.965 meters</p>
<p>(6) Wu Huanqing (Guangdong) 44.49 meters</p>
<p>Women's High Jump First Place: Tang Ruirong (Wang Kai and International Society)</p>
<h3>Men's 200-meter Final: Fu Jincheng Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>In the men's 200-meter final, there was a false start on the first attempt by Zeng Rongzhong. The race was restarted. Fu Jincheng, full of ambition, took the lead with a vigorous leap from the starting block. Huang Feilong followed closely but ultimately couldn't overtake him. Dai Shuguo started the slowest and was in last place. After 50 meters, he gritted his teeth and sprinted, moving up to second place at 70 meters. However, he was still about six meters behind Fu at the finish line. The differences between the third-place finisher and the subsequent runners were all within a shoulder's width. He Peigen and Xue Jianqiu were not selected. Fu Jincheng's time of 22.9 seconds was quite respectable. After the competition, Zhang Fakui presented the awards.</p>
<p>First Place: Fu Jincheng (Malaya) - 22.9 seconds</p>
<p>Second Place: Dai Shuguo (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Third Place: Ye Songshan (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Zeng Rongzhong (Jiangsu)</p>
<p>Fifth Place: Huang Feilong (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Sixth Place: Han Jinglin (Hebei)</p>
<h3>Men's High Hurdles Final: Lin Shaozhou Retains Championship Title</h3>
<p>In the men's 110-meter hurdles final, eight runners started. Liu Yingjun was surpassed by Lin Shaozhou at the first hurdle, who then maintained the lead all the way to the finish line. Lin's hurdling was powerful and exceptionally smooth, clearing the hurdles perfectly without going too high or too low. Mr. Lin retained the championship title for the third consecutive National Games, truly demonstrating his unique skills and unmatched abilities. Although this time his performance didn't improve, the wind undoubtedly played a role.</p>
<p>First Place: Lin Shaozhou (Shanghai) - 16.3 seconds</p>
<p>Second Place: Huang Yingjie (Guangdong)</p>
<p>Third Place: Liu Yingjun (Beijing)</p>

<h3>Women's 10-meter Hurdles Final: Qian Hangsu Breaks National Record Again</h3>
<p>Her Stance Was Particularly Graceful Throughout; 14.4 Seconds, Slightly Slower Than the Heats</p>
<p>In the women's 80-meter hurdles final, there were eight participants. Qian Hangsu was in the outermost lane. From the start, Qian Hangsu took the initiative and led the way. The two Malayan athletes followed closely behind. By the fifth or sixth hurdle, second-place Xu Fengying was already almost a hurdle behind. Qian's posture was graceful, and her hurdling was exceptionally agile. In the final hurdle, she exerted even more effort to sprint and won the championship. Although the result wasn't as good as in the semifinals, she still achieved 14.4 seconds, breaking her own national record of 14.5 seconds. It was no easy feat for the shortest athlete, Xu Fengying from Malaya, to win the silver medal.</p>
<p>First Place: Qian Hangsu (Shanghai) - 14.4 seconds</p>
<p>Second Place: Xu Fengying (Malaya)</p>
<p>Third Place: Hu Shufang (Hubei)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Cao Hanzhang (Malaya)</p>

<h3>Women's High Jump Champion Tang Ruirong</h3>
<p>New and Beautiful Style</p>
<p>A Result of 1.32 Meters, All of Shanghai's Famous Athletes Were Unsuccessful</p>
<p>In the women's high jump final, there were over fifty participants. The final took two hours to complete. Famous Shanghai athletes such as Zhu Tianzhen and Rong Shuzhen were unsuccessful. Starting at 1.05 meters, only six people cleared 1.25 meters: Tang Duanrui, He Meiying, Feng Miaoyuan, Pang Yu, Su Bolan, and Chen Zhongfang. When the height was raised to 1.28 meters, Chen Cuifang failed on all three attempts and was ranked sixth. Pang Yu, Su Bolan, and Feng Miaoyuan all cleared the height. The height was then raised to 1.30 meters. He Meiying cleared it on the first attempt, and Tang Duanrong cleared it on the second attempt. Pang, Su, and Feng all failed. The height was lowered back to 1.28 meters to determine the rankings. Based on who cleared the height first, Feng Miaoyuan was ranked third, Su Bolan was ranked fourth after clearing the height on the second attempt, and Pang Yu was ranked fifth after failing to clear the height. The height was then raised to 1.33 meters. He Meiying failed on all three attempts, and Tang Ruirong cleared it on the second attempt. Thus, Tang won the championship, and He won the silver medal. Afterward, the height was raised to 1.35 meters, but both failed on all attempts. Champion Tang Ruirong had a result of 1.355 meters in the Fujian preliminaries, tying the national record. Tang used the American rolling jump style, and her posture was very correct, making her an outstanding performer in women's high jump. She is also a pioneer in the major sports meets in our country. The complete results are recorded below.</p>
<p>First Place: Tang Shanrong (Fujian) - 1.32 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: He Meiying (Hunan) - 1.30 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Feng Miaoyuan (Guangdong) - 1.28 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Su Bolan (Hubei) - 1.28 meters</p>

<h3>Women's 100-meter Final: Li Sen Wins the Championship Again</h3>
<p>Disappointing Result of 13.7 Seconds</p>
<p>Li had the best start, but was three meters behind Deng Yinjiao before the 30-meter mark, lining up with Qian Hangsu. At 50 meters, the competition among the three was intense, forming a straight line. By the 70-meter mark, Li broke away and took the lead. Deng and Qian tried hard to catch up but couldn't surpass her. By the finish line, Li won by slightly less than a meter over Qian Hangsu and almost two meters over Deng Yinjiao. The result of 13.7 seconds was only mediocre. After the race, Madam Wang Zhengting presented the awards in order.</p>
<p>First Place: Li Sen (Shanghai) - 13.7 seconds</p>
<p>Second Place: Qian Hangsu (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Third Place: Deng Yinjiao (Malaya)</p>

<h3>Today's Final Predictions</h3>
<p>Pole Vault: Fu Baolu to Compete</p>
<p>The number of participants in today's pole vault final is fewer than in any other event, with only about thirty people. Far Eastern Games silver medalist Fu Baolu told reporters yesterday that he will definitely compete today. With Mr. Fu's past experience, there is great hope that he will win the championship. Furthermore, Wang Hejun told reporters that he has been consistently clearing 2.70 meters in recent practice jumps and is very confident. In today's final, he may seize Fu Baolu's throne. Other contenders include Ma Deguang from Guangdong, Wang Shilin and Zhan Yiyuan from Beijing, and Bao Yuan from Nanjing. The national record of 3 meters held by Fu Baolu will likely be difficult to break.</p>
<p>Fierce Competition Expected in the 1500 Meters</p>
<p>Today's 1500-meter final will be a grand spectacle, one of the most exciting events. Strong competitor Jia Fengren is very confident. He told reporters yesterday that he is very confident of winning the championship this time and breaking the national record, with a time under 4 minutes and 20 seconds. Gu Desheng, Li Denggui, and Wang Huibu from Shanxi are also eyeing the prize, while Qiu Zhongdeng from Shanghai, who is from Shandong and has attended the Far Eastern Games, is also a strong competitor. It remains to be seen who will emerge victorious.</p>
<p>Qian and Pan to Compete for the Javelin Throne</p>
<p>In today's women's javelin final, Pan Chu and Qian Hangsu will compete. Both have results above 30 meters, so the national record is not a concern. The third and fourth places will likely be contested by Chen Rongming and Xu Yuan. Both have results above 27 meters, so Shanghai has the potential to sweep the top four spots. Ji Shuyun from Qingdao, Yuan Hengrui from Henan, and Yan Xiurong from Guangdong also have a chance of being selected.</p>

<h3>Dong Shuzhao Forfeits the 1500 Meters</h3>
<p>Dong Shuzhao is one of the top middle-distance runners in the country. His absence yesterday raised doubts. However, reporters learned that in the 800-meter race the day before, Mr. Dong was wearing his younger brother's running shoes, which didn't fit his feet. However, the race had already started, and he couldn't change them, so his feet were slightly injured. He is currently resting and plans to focus on the 400-meter race.</p>

<h3>Decisions of the Joint Meeting of the Competition and Judging Committees: Cancellation of Hao Chunde and Xu Heng's Qualifications; Representatives from Beijing and Zhejiang Report; Decision to Allow Basketball Players to Self-Report; Player Qualification Issue Temporarily Resolved</h3>
<p>The Competition Committee and the Judging Committee of the Games held their second joint meeting at the New Asia Restaurant yesterday evening, starting at 9:00 PM, to discuss the eligibility of Shanghai players Hao Chunde and Xu Heng. The meeting was attended by 29 people, including Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the Competition Committee, Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Judging Committee, and committee members Wu Yunrui, Wu Cunwei, Yuan Lidun, Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Ma Yuehan, Qiu Jixiang, Dong Shouyi, Rong Qizhao, and Shen Guoquan. Also present were Chen Jianru, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Wang Jianwu, Beijing coach (representing the Beijing delegation), and Zhu Jiasheng, leader of the Zhejiang delegation, and Liu Changhe, leader of the Hubei delegation. The meeting lasted for three hours and adjourned at midnight. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Important Decisions Yesterday: First, Chen Jianru, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, reported on Hao Chunde's participation in the Beijing preliminaries, and Zhu Jiasheng, the leader of the Zhejiang delegation, reported on Xu Heng's situation. After a lengthy discussion, it was resolved that both Hao and Xu had indeed participated in the Beijing and Hangzhou preliminaries, and their qualifications should be revoked. At the same time, it was also resolved that a notice should be issued to all delegation leaders, stating that any basketball players who have violated the above rule should immediately report themselves. If discovered afterward, the qualifications of the entire team will be revoked. This serves as a warning, and thus the major wave of player eligibility issues has temporarily come to an end. The resolutions passed last night are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to cancel the qualifications of Shanghai players Hao Chunde and Xu Heng to participate in this Games; the resolution was passed.</p>
<p>(2) Proposal to immediately notify the leaders of all units that any basketball players who do not meet the eligibility requirements should report themselves. If they fail to self-report, once discovered, even if only one person is ineligible, the qualifications of the entire team will be revoked; the resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Voluntarily Withdraws: Due to the revocation of Wu Bixian's qualification, the Hubei delegation raised a protest, which also involved the eligibility of Shanghai players Wang Jihuai, Hao Chunde, and Xu Heng. The Competition and Judging Committees held meetings and exchanged correspondence for several days, which was quite busy. It is now known that the Shanghai delegation, considering its position as the host city, and with the aim of settling matters peacefully, and in order to uphold the spirit of the Games and avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary complications between units, had notified the Games beforehand yesterday that it would voluntarily withdraw Hao and Xu. Hao and Xu have also declared their withdrawal to the Games. This spirit is commendable. As for Wang Jihuai's eligibility, it has been confirmed and is not an issue.</p>
<p>The letter from Jiang Jianbai, the representative of Shanghai, and Shao Rugan, the leader of the delegation, to Chairman Wang and the committee members of the Games Competition Committee yesterday stated: "Respectfully, regarding the eligibility of our team's players Hao Chunde and Xu Heng to participate in the Games, the procedures are complete, and there is no violation of the Games regulations. We have checked and submitted the documents for your review. Now, as our team is the host city, in order to avoid misunderstandings between units and unnecessary complications, we are willing to voluntarily withdraw them. We hereby request your attention to this matter. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Wang and the members of the Competition Committee, Jiang Jianbai, representative of the Shanghai delegation, Shao Rugan, leader of the delegation."</p>
<p>Hao and Xu Also Declare Withdrawal: Hao Chunde and Xu Heng also sent a letter to the Games yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, in recent days, the issue of Chunde and Heng's eligibility has attracted attention from all parties, and has burdened the Competition and Judging Committees with meetings and discussions. However, Chunde was appointed by Nanjing as a player representative without his consent. Heng went to Nanyang with the Shanghai Zhonghua Football Team in July and is currently serving in Shanghai, and wishes to represent Shanghai. On October 7, the Zhejiang Department of Education sent a letter to the Games to withdraw Heng's qualification as a Zhejiang representative. We believe that the Nanjing and Zhejiang authorities hastily appointed De and Heng as player representatives without obtaining De and Heng's consent, which has led to De and Heng being suspected of representing two units. De and Heng have been involved in sports for many years and understand the meaning of sports. There is no need to argue about who is right and who is wrong. In order to ensure the smooth running of the Games and the friendship between units, De and Heng are willing to voluntarily give up all competition rights in this Games. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Wang and the members of the Competition Committee, Hao Chunde and Xu Heng."</p>

<p>The Truth About Hao Chunde's Situation: Mr. Hao Chunde discussed the truth about the matter as follows: "After graduating from Jinan University, I continued to serve at my alma mater, teaching English, for the past four years. This year, during the summer vacation, I went to the Nanjing Training Corps to help a friend with clerical work. It was a temporary position, as I did not accept a formal appointment and did not resign from my alma mater. During the vacation, I went to the Qingdao training camp for training. After completing the training, I went to Beijing and Shanghai and did not have a fixed address. Although the president of Shanghai University has changed this semester, my position will continue. When Nanjing held the preliminary competition, I saw in the newspaper that I was said to have participated in the Beijing preliminary competition. However, the truth is that this did not happen. I did not register in Beijing, nor did I participate in the Beijing preliminary competition. However, the person in charge of the Nanjing delegation once asked me if I would represent Beijing and promised that if I and Wang Jihuai could represent Beijing, we would receive special treatment. Ji Huai and I immediately refused. Later, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs formally sent representatives to contact me and tried to persuade me to work for Beijing, but I refused. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs directly sent a letter to the Training Corps, requesting to express their regards to me, but it was not allowed. At that time, the Training Corps replied to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that I had not been issued an appointment letter and was only helping out in Beijing temporarily. There are records to prove this. As for the Nanjing newspapers' banquet, I also received an invitation, but the invitation did not state that it was a banquet for athletes. It only said to have dinner at the Central Hotel. I did not expect that there was a scheme behind this. When I arrived, I saw that most of the attendees were from the sports community and a few famous athletes from Beijing. I did not sign the guest book. At that time, reporters from various newspapers privately inquired about my situation. I immediately stated that I had already registered with Shanghai and would not represent Beijing. This time, Beijing registered me with the Games without formally notifying me or obtaining my consent. I still have work at a school in Shanghai, so I left Beijing for Shanghai on the 5th. Yesterday, I saw in the special edition of the five newspapers that I arrived in Shanghai on the 9th and participated in the Beijing oath-taking ceremony, which was shocking. The Beijing oath-taking ceremony took place after the 5th. I returned to Shanghai on the 5th, so how could I have participated? This kind of groundless talk and arbitrary insult is really inappropriate. This time, Beijing filed a protest. I originally wanted to present a legitimate reason and let the Games handle it fairly. However, in order to ensure the smooth running of the Games, I decided to resolve the matter by making a big issue into a small one, and a small one into nothing. I voluntarily withdrew from the Games. Since I have withdrawn, I have to explain the facts to all sectors of society. I will remain silent and wait for the Games to investigate and make a fair judgment. Whether I registered or not, please ask Beijing to provide evidence. As for the banquet and the photo, I did not know that it was a banquet for athletes. Also, when the photo was taken, many people said it was okay, it was just a commemorative dinner."</p>
<p>Xu Heng Talks About What Happened: Xu Heng talked about the truth as follows: "I have never participated in the preliminary competition in Zhejiang. On June 29, I left Zhejiang to join the Shanghai Zhonghua Football Team for the South Pacific expedition to Java. After returning to Shanghai, I intended to resign from Zhejiang. When Zhejiang sent a letter seeking my consent, I did not reply. Instead, they put my name on the list. I did not fill out or sign any registration forms. Since I am serving in Shanghai, I am representing Shanghai this time. Mr. Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the Competition Committee, also explained to me that there was no problem. In order to ensure the smooth running of the Games, I voluntarily gave up my qualification."</p>
<p>Retaining the Two Judging Committee Members, Zhang and Chen: The Organizing Committee of the National Games sent a letter yesterday in response to the resignations of the judging committee members Zhang Zhengfan and Chen Kun, stating: "Respectfully replying to your letter of October 12, we acknowledge receipt. The organizing committee held a joint meeting of the Competition and Judging Committees on the morning of the 11th, which was after the city government's banquet. All notification letters were delivered to the city government on the spot. On that day, you did not attend the banquet hosted by the city government.

<h3>Men's Singles Second Week Concludes: Xu Weipei in a Thrilling Battle with Xu Chengji; Despite Losing Two Sets 4-6, Little Xu Still Earns Praise; "Left-Arm General" Lin Wangsu Is Unstoppable</h3>
<p>The second round of the men's tennis singles tournament took place yesterday. Eight groups competed. Four groups, including Ping, Qing, Ji, and Su, played in the morning at 9:00 AM, while four groups, including Java, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Hunan, began their matches at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Among them, the match between Xu Chengji from Java and Xu Weipei from Hong Kong was the most exciting. Hundreds of spectators watched intently. The match between Zeng Duancai, the second singles player from Java, and He Jialiu from Hong Kong was also very competitive, as both sides had equal strength. The other groups were one-sided affairs. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Beijing Achieves Double Victory: Xie Hua, the first singles player from Beijing, opened the match against Duan Yingshan from Qingdao. Xie took the lead with fierce cross-court shots, winning two games in a row. Duan tried to counterattack and returned two games, making the score 2-2. Xie then added four more games, winning the first set 6-4. In the second set, Duan was exhausted and struggled to cope. Xie won the set easily. Wen Yawen, the second singles player from Beijing, is a rising young star. His baseline serves and overhead smashes are powerful. Chen Gengchun from Qingdao is also a skilled player, but he was outmatched by Wen, who won two sets 6-1 and 6-4.</p>
<p>Hebei and Jiangsu Each Win One Group: Zhang Xinhua, the first singles player from Hebei, faced Huang Shijing from Jiangsu. Their skills were evenly matched, and it was difficult to determine who was better. It was a battle of attrition that lasted two hours before a winner was decided. After each winning their service game in the first set, Huang took the lead twice at 5-3 and 6-5, but it was a fleeting moment. Zhang won three consecutive games and won the second set 8-6. In the second set, Huang was determined to retaliate and attacked repeatedly. He managed to win a set 6-4. However, Huang was exhausted at this point. Although he tried to rally in the third set, he was unable to maintain his strength and eventually lost. Zhang won the final victory with a score of 6-2. Li Dingyi, the second singles player from Hebei, and Xu Cida from Jiangsu had similar hitting styles. However, Li was overweight and not good at running. The match ended in two sets, with Xu winning 6-1 and 6-4.</p>
<p>Malaysia Plays Casually: Lin Wangsu, the "left-arm general" and first singles player from Malaysia, is also a dangerous figure in this Games. He faced Ling Zhiyang from Hunan yesterday. It was a small test, and he did not show his full potential. Ling only managed to win two games in the first set. The rest of the games were dominated by Lin. The match ended in half an hour, with Lin winning 6-2 and 6-0. Chen Qian, the second singles player, has excellent skills, but lacks experience, which is his major weakness. He faced Zhang Jinfan from Hunan yesterday. In the first set, Chen made many unforced errors and self-destructed repeatedly. Zhang took the lead at 3-1 and 5-2. Chen gradually calmed down and made accurate shots. He won five consecutive games, winning the first set 7-5. In the second set, Zhang lost momentum and was unable to counterattack. Chen revealed his sharpness and continued to gain points, winning 6-1.</p>
<p>Zeng Duancai Shows His Colors: Zeng Duancai from Java had not been seen in action since the opening of the Games. It was unknown what his skills were like, but his match was crucial to the outcome of this Games. He faced He Jialiu from Hong Kong in his debut. Those who are interested in this Games wanted to find out more about him, so there were many spectators. Zeng's skills are good, but compared to the other national players, he is slightly inferior. His shots are steady, but he lacks a killer shot, making it difficult for him to defeat his opponents. He Jialiu is a famous veteran from Hong Kong. His skills are similar to Zeng's. He had a good chance of winning yesterday, but he lost due to his old age and physical weakness. In the first set, He served first. Each lost their service game. The situation was the same in the following games. Zeng took the lead at 5-4. Zeng served in the next game and broke the record, ending the first set at 6-4. In the second set, the situation was the opposite. Each won by serving, then Zeng changed his style and took a lead of 5-3. He tried hard to resist and made a last-ditch effort, winning one game. But the situation was hopeless, and he succumbed again 4-6.</p>
<p>Weipei Loses with Honor: National player Xu Chengji had been performing brilliantly in recent days, attracting a lot of attention from the audience. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the singles match against Xu Weipei from Hong Kong was scheduled. Xu is also a strong player, so there was bound to be a thrilling battle. Before 1:00 PM, spectators flocked to watch, and the venue was soon full. Those who arrived later stood around the venue, several rows deep. However, because this obstructed the view of the back rows, everyone sat on the ground at the start of the game, even those who were dressed in beautiful clothes, which shows how captivating the match was. Unfortunately, Xu Chengji played very loosely yesterday. His cannonball serves and overhead smashes were nowhere to be seen, which was disappointing. Some said that he would face the strong Wang Wenzheng tomorrow, and he would have to exert all his strength to compete, so he was conserving his energy. He just needed to defeat little Xu, which seems reasonable. Little Xu, as always, did not slack off. Although he knew he was no match, he still tried hard to fight and did his best, which was commendable. His sharp serves and clever drop shots often made Xu Chengji sigh in admiration, and he won a lot of applause, which was something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Chengji Reaps the Rewards of Hard Work: At exactly 1:00 PM, the battle between Xu and Xu began. Xu took the lead and quickly won two games. Seeing that the situation was not good, Xu changed his strategy and repeatedly used sharp drop shots to attack, winning one game. Xu then took the lead again at 3-1. Little Xu chased and tied the score at 3-3. Xu then added two more games with long shots. He won the first set 6-4. In the second set, little Xu still did not improve and trailed 2-3. He then went to the net and smashed the ball, frequently using clever tactics and drop shots to gain points. He managed to win three consecutive games and took a lead of 4-3. But his strength was slightly inferior, and Xu did not dare to be careless. He chopped, smashed, and attacked from all directions. One game after another, he won three consecutive games and ended the match with 6-4.</p>
<p>The Situation of Singles and Doubles: The second week of the men's singles has ended. The third week will begin today. The matches are scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>Chuan Wang Wenzheng vs. Jing Ma Shaobo; Chuan Qian Yaobin vs. Jing Li Pizu; Java Xu Chengji vs. Ji Zhang Xinhua; Java Zeng Duancai vs. Su Xu Ci; Malaysia Lin Wangsu vs. Beijing Xie Hua; Malaysia Chen Qian vs. Ping Wen Yawen; Shanghai Cai Baohua vs. Yue Xu Runpei; Shanghai Qiu Feihai vs. Yue Li Guangpei.

These four groups will hold the semi-finals today to compete for the finals.</p>

<p>Lost to Yang Weibin of Guangdong 1-2: The Second Week of Singles Competition Has Ended</p>
<p>Yesterday, four women's tennis singles matches and two doubles matches were held. Except for the doubles match between Wang Chunqing and Wang Chunzhen of Shanxi against Hebei in the afternoon, which attracted a large audience, the singles matches were not noticed because they were held at the same time as the matches between Xu Chengji and Lin Wangsu. In this unnoticed situation, Mao Yuwen, the first singles player from Shanghai, was defeated by Yang Weibin from Guangdong, which was a major loss for Shanghai. Fortunately, Wei Maigu, the second singles player, defeated Chen Xiangwei from Guangdong with ease, winning two sets to console themselves. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai and Guangdong Each Win One Singles Match: At 1:00 PM, Mao Yuwen, the first singles player from Shanghai, was struck a heavy blow by Yang Weibin, losing four games in a row. Miss Mao remained calm and unconcerned. Relying on her years of experience, she calmly plotted a comeback. She managed to recover and make the opponent panic and make unforced errors. Mao chased the score to 4-4 and eventually turned the tide, winning 8-6. Judging from the situation of this set, with Mao's calm spirit, it would not have been difficult to win the set in one go. Who knew that she would lose two consecutive sets and fail, which is regrettable. In the second singles match, Wei Maigu from Shanghai easily defeated Chen Xiangwei from Guangdong. Chen's skills were mediocre, and she was unable to strike a blow. Wei won twelve consecutive games with ease.</p>
<p>Coconut Girls: Two Losses</p>
<p>Both singles matches between Nanjing and Malaysia went through three sets before a winner was decided, but there was little excitement. Most of the points were decided by unforced errors. As a result, both groups of the Coconut Girls from Malaysia were defeated and eliminated. In the first group, Huang Shannong from Nanjing faced Lu Suli from Malaysia. Ms. Lu took the lead, winning 6-1 easily. But then Huang Shannong also returned the favor, winning 6-1. In the final set, both sides worked hard on endurance. The score was tied at 3-3 and 4-4, which was difficult to determine. In the end, Shannong won 6-3. The second group had the longest match time. Each game was a long struggle, and the situation was very even, but the interest was dull. Chen Qing from Nanjing defeated Li Hongzhang's wife from Malaysia 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
<p>Wang Sisters: Extremely Sharp: From 3:00 PM, only two women's doubles matches were held. The appearance of the Wang sisters attracted many spectators. Their opponents, Liang Shaozhi and Chen Huan from Hebei, had inferior skills and were no match for Chunqing and Chunwei. Chunqing's shots were fierce, and although Chunwei was slightly inferior, she was still a top-notch player. The women's singles final will definitely be a sisters' battle. Because their opponents were not strong, they did not exert their full strength and easily defeated the Hebei players in two sets.</p>
<p>Emei Mountain Girls: Difficult to Win: The other doubles match was between Sichuan and Beijing. It was a difficult and complex match. Beijing was still composed of singles players Situ Meizhen and Tang Mingzhen. Sichuan was represented by Li Yiping and Zhao Yunhua. Their strengths were evenly matched, and the match was very tense. In the first set, Beijing had a chance to win but lost 6-4. In the second set, Beijing took the lead at 5-4, but still lost 5-7. Sichuan won steadily, while Beijing lost due to a lack of assurance.</p>
<p>Singles Tournament: Second Week Ends: After several days of competition, the schedule is heavy. The second week of singles has now been completed. The third week will begin today. The situation is becoming more and more intense. The first week of doubles is half over. Guangdong vs. Shanghai and Nanjing vs. Malaysia will face off today. The remaining four groups will hold the semi-finals on the 16th. The singles situation is listed below:</p>

<h3>Anhui Army Resists Strong Enemies: Shanghai Nearly Eliminated by Shanxi; Barely Secures a Place in the Next Round with a Three-Point Lead in the Last Minute; Hebei and Guangdong Advance, Zhejiang and Fujian Suffer Defeats</h3>
<p>Yesterday's four men's basketball preliminary matches were held on time. The audience has increased several times, and the stands around the stadium were full. In the first match, Hubei faced Anhui. Although the Anhui army resisted their strong enemies, they were defeated due to their inferior skills. In the second match, Shanghai faced Shanxi. In the audience's prediction, Shanxi was definitely no match for Shanghai. But the opposite was true. The Shanghai players were sluggish, while the Shanxi players were all brave. Until the last three minutes, Shanxi was still leading by four points. Later, Yin Guiren scored several goals, and at the end of the game, Shanghai barely defeated Shanxi by three points, narrowly avoiding elimination. In the match between Hebei and Zhejiang, although several key players from Hebei did not participate, their strength was still very strong. Yesterday, they used high-speed passing and accurate shooting to defeat Zhejiang effortlessly. Although they have no hope of winning the championship in this Games, they can at least get a place in the second round. Guangdong and Fujian had equal strength, and the match was very tense. In the end, Guangdong defeated Fujian by six points. The defeat of the Fujian army was due to bad luck, not due to a lack of effort. Today's schedule is as follows: Beijing vs. Henan at 9:00 AM, Malaysia vs. Qingdao at 10:00 AM, Philippines vs. Sichuan at 1:00 PM, and Nanjing vs. Shandong at 3:00 PM. It is expected that the match between Malaysia and Qingdao will be worth watching, while the others will likely be one-sided. The details of yesterday's matches are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Hubei Defeats Anhui by a Large Margin: 71 to 33</h3>
<p>The match between Hubei and Anhui was held at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The Hubei team is a first-class team. Liu Zhenwu and Yin Hongxiang have represented China in the Far Eastern Games. Their strength needs no introduction. However, they did not seem to be in their best form yesterday. They were particularly nervous at the beginning of the game. After Zheng Sen was substituted in, their formation became more solid. Anhui is a mediocre team, but they tried their best to resist yesterday. Zhang Dahai, a tall player, was particularly outstanding. Hu Dewen was also agile and commendable. Although they were defeated, their spirit was commendable.</p>
<p>After referee Li Youzhen blew the whistle, Ge Ke scored first, followed by two more points. Liu Zhenyuan's shots were accurate, and he returned with points. Zhang Dahai, a tall player, scored two points with a loud shout. Seeing that the situation was not good, Hubei quickly called Zheng Sen to play. The three forwards made contact and scored one after another, ending the first half with a score of 34 to 14. In the second half, the Anhui army tried their best to resist, but they were defeated with a score of 33 to 71 due to their inferior strength.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Wins by a Hair's Breadth, Barely Beats Shanxi by Three Points</h3>
<p>The smoke of war between Hubei and Anhui had just cleared, and the competition between Shanghai and Shanxi was about to begin. Most people thought it would be another one-sided affair. Little did they know, unpredictable things can happen. The performance of the Shanxi team exceeded all expectations. Conversely, the Shanghai team was dispirited and disorganized. It wasn't until the very last minute that they barely managed to secure a victory by three points.</p>
<p>In terms of tactics, the Shanxi team was not particularly outstanding either, but everyone fought bravely and didn't slack off at all. Unfortunately, their actions were a bit slow, and they preferred long shots, which were often inaccurate. That was their miscalculation; otherwise, they could have eliminated Shanghai earlier.</p>
<p>The Shanghai team's performance yesterday was entirely unremarkable, especially their slow movements. Every time they had the ball, they stood like wooden chickens, which angered the fans, who started to support the opposing team. If they had brought Yin Guiren and Wang Nanzhen onto the court yesterday, the result would have been unimaginable. After briefly gaining a slight advantage towards the end, they played cautiously, like 麻雀 (mahjong), trying to avoid mistakes. If they can maintain this until the end of the game, they will face the formidable Hubei team in the second round of the midweek games. This hurdle will likely be difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>During the match, Shanxi forward Li Min scored first, followed by another solo drive straight to the basket, giving them a 7-0 lead. When the score reached 9-0, Shanghai's Lu Zhongen finally managed to clumsily score a goal. The situation remained unfavorable, so they quickly brought Yin Guiren and Wang Nanzhen onto the court. With two long shots, they managed to tie the score at 11-11, and the atmosphere changed slightly. After that, the scores fluctuated, closely following each other. The first half ended with a 15-15 tie.</p>
<p>After the break, Yin Guiren made two free throws, giving Shanghai a six-point lead. Shanxi's Lao Li was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>He succeeded with a long shot from mid-court. The difference between the scores remained at three or four points. When the Shanghai defense slipped up, Lao Li seized the opportunity and tied the score at 30-30. Then, they took the lead with 34-30. At that time, there were only three minutes left in the game. The audience cheered for Shanxi, and whenever Shanghai got the ball, they booed. Unfortunately, Shanxi's long shots failed, allowing the opponents to capitalize. Lu Zhongen and Yin Guiren each made a free throw and a field goal, bringing the score to 37-34. Seeing that time was running out, Shanghai focused on avoiding mistakes rather than trying to score. They passed the ball around, stalling for time. Before long, the whistle blew, and they barely managed to defeat Shanxi, akin to the style of the Thirteen Sisters (female archers).</p>

<h3>Referee　Tong Furan Inspector Xu Biao</h3>
<p>Hebei Overcomes Zhejiang　42 to 18</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, Hebei faced Zhejiang, with Zhang Guodong as the referee. Hebei is a birthplace of basketball talent, and their skills are naturally superior. During the team selection, top players such as Shen Yugong, Shen Yuqin, and Wang Yuzeng were not selected for various reasons, which inevitably had a slight impact on their strength. However, in yesterday's match against Zhejiang, they still played with ease. The team's overall cooperation and technique were excellent, and their passing was particularly fast. If they continue to improve, they may be able to win the championship. The Zhejiang team's technique was also decent, but it's rare for them to defeat the elite Hebei team.</p>
<p>Shortly after the start of the game, Hebei's Liu Baocheng opened the scoring, followed by Xu Zhaoxiong. When the score reached 10-0, Zhejiang's He Yixiao managed to score. Li Shaotang single-handedly defended the rear, standing as solid as a fortress. The Zhejiang forwards could only sigh in despair at the basket. In the first half, Hebei won 22-9. In the second half, the Zhejiang team briefly counterattacked, scoring a few points. However, it was like a flash in the pan, and soon Hebei dominated again. In the end, they won convincingly with a score of 42-18.</p>

<p>Guangdong Slightly Defeats Fujian　58 to 52</p>
<p>Following the Hebei-Zhejiang match, Guangdong played against Fujian. The strengths of the two sides were fairly even, and the score was very close. The match was also quite tense. In the first half, Guangdong took the lead with a burst of energy and smooth cooperation, winning 36-24. In the second half, both sides felt their energy waning, and substitutions were made. The situation then eased slightly. Because the competition was so intense, there were many fouls. Guangdong's Huang Liangfu and Fujian's Huang Zongbiao were both sent off the court one after the other. In the middle of the second half, the score was once tied at 40-40. After that, Guangdong consistently led by a few points until the end of the game, winning 58-52.</p>

<p>Hebei Strongly Defeats Hubei, Shanghai Easily Defeats Malaya, Chen Rongming Scores 19 Points in One Quarter, Today Beijing Plays Jiangxi, Jiangsu Plays Sichuan</p>
<p>In the preliminary rounds of the women's basketball competition, there were two matches yesterday. In the morning, Hebei played against Hubei, and Hebei prevailed with their height advantage, winning 48-23. In the afternoon, Shanghai played against Malaya. Shanghai was the champion team from the previous games, and their chances of winning this year are still high. Malaya was no match for them and was eliminated with a score of 26-47. Today, Beijing will play against Jiangxi in the morning. Because the memorial week must be done at 8 o'clock, it was changed to 11 o'clock. The Beijing team is extremely strong, and Jiangxi is likely not their opponent. In the afternoon, Sichuan will play against Jiangsu. It is hard to say who will win. The situation yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>Hebei Defeats Hubei　The game between Hebei and Hubei was held at 8:00 AM yesterday. Hebei's star player, Jin Shuquan, was tall and made many successful plays. In the first quarter, Hubei tried their best to resist and only trailed by four points. In the second quarter, Hebei's forwards were very active, and the opponent's basket was frequently breached, winning 13-5. After a short break, Hubei's girls tried to turn the tide, and the competition was fierce, ending in a 10-10 tie. By the fourth quarter, their physical strength was failing, and they watched as Hebei's girls charged into battle. As a result, they were eliminated with a score of 23-48.</p>

<p>Shanghai Eliminates Malaya　The Shanghai-Malaya match was one of the highlights of yesterday, attracting about 3,000 spectators. The Shanghai team is based on the Liangjiang team, and most of the players were members of the championship team from the previous All-China Games. Their strength is extremely strong. The main player, Chen Rongming, is no less skilled than the highly skilled men. Chen Jucai and Pan Meng are also veteran players, and the defenders Chen Baixue and Chen Wanqing guard the gates, making it extremely difficult for the opponent to score. The Malayan team's skills are also above average, but it is a pity that they encountered such a strong opponent in the first game and were unable to show their full potential. This is a regret for the team. After the game started, Shanghai's Chen Rongming, watched from outside the arena, and the team was still able to cope. Li Dongying scored first, and Chen Rongtang tied the score. In the first quarter, Shanghai led by two points with a score of 8-6. At the start of the second quarter, the star player Chen Rongming entered the arena, greeted by applause from all around. As expected, her skills were extraordinary. She quickly scored three points, and Chen Jucai assisted, also scoring a few points. Malaya gradually showed signs of collapse, losing the first half with a score of 9-23. In the second half, Rongming left the arena again, and the situation might have eased. However, Malaya's lineup changed repeatedly, causing disarray. In the third and fourth quarters, they lost with scores of 9-12 and 8-12.</p>

<h3>Beijing Defeats Anhui Decisively, Straight Sets, Disparate Strengths</h3>
<p>In the preliminary round of the men's volleyball competition, Beijing played against Anhui. It started at 1:00 PM, and the result was a one-sided affair. Beijing decisively defeated Anhui in straight sets. The scores were as follows:</p>
<p>First Set　The Beijing-Anhui match was not particularly exciting because, although Beijing is not a strong team in this tournament, they are far superior to the newly formed Anhui team. Therefore, from the beginning, they were unusually relaxed. Anhui's serves often gave the opponent opportunities, and when the ball entered their territory, they didn't know how to save it. In the first half of the first set, Anhui only scored one point. Although the situation improved slightly in the second half, they were still far behind. The set ended with a score of 21-7.</p>
<p>Second Set　Anhui hoped to recover lost ground and at one point trailed by only 9-6, which seemed promising. The front row was slightly more active, but they easily wasted several good balls, which led to their collapse again. As a result, they lost again with a score of 21-6.</p>
<p>Third Set　The one-sided affair continued. Anhui was unable to rally and had no choice but to accept their fate. Tian Jingyao put his heart and soul into the game, but to no avail. Beijing's momentum was unrestrained, and they were successful in both offense and defense. As a result, Beijing won the third set easily with a score of 21-8. Referee Li Xinbiao.</p>

<h3>Malaya Unexpectedly Loses to Hunan, Disorganized and Loses Three Sets in a Row</h3>
<p>The women's volleyball match between Malaya and Hunan started at 3:00 PM yesterday. As a result, Hunan won 3-0. The scores were as follows:</p>
<p>Brave in Internal Conflicts, Killing Each Other　The Malayan team came out to practice at 1:45 PM, wearing dark pink vests and looking elegant and tall. The Beijing girls, on the other hand, were taller but simple and unadorned. This shows the different environments of the two sides. After the serve, Malaya immediately appeared overwhelmed, losing five points in a row. The Beijing front row was able to attack and defend with ease, so they consistently led the score. After switching sides at 11-9, the Malayan girls became even less effective, disappointing the audience. They often killed each other when the ball entered their territory, engaging in internal conflicts with no order. As a result, the first set ended with a score of 21-14, and the Hunan heroines won the first set.</p>
<p>Swift as an Arrow, Accomplishing in One Go　The Hunan team, such as Zheng Peikun and Liu Yuheng, seemed to have received the highest level of training. When the ball came, they seized the opportunity and were determined to kill the point. Their actions were commendable. In the second set, Malaya's Hu Wanxia served, but it was hit into a dead ball by the opponent. Hunan's Liu Xingheng returned the favor, and the ball was as swift as an arrow and landed in a good spot. Malaya's middle row was disorganized and慌慌张张, almost unable to cope. In the second half, when Hunan's Lu Jingqiu served, she finished the entire set in one go. This not only astonished the Malayan players but also excited the spectators. The score was 21-9.</p>
<p>Short-Lived Fate, Time Waits for No One　In the third set, Malaya adjusted their lineup and brought in new players to fight. However, the opponent did not back down, so the struggle was more intense. With the score tied at 4-4, Miss Zheng Peikun shot the ball into the opponent's territory with extreme force, leaving Malaya with no way to retaliate. After a few consecutive points, the sides switched. In the second half, Malaya had a slight chance and scored points against China. However, fate was short-lived, and time waited for no one. The Hunan team was the first to reach 21 points, while Malaya only had 17 points. The overall score was 2-0, and Hunan won.</p>
<p>Complete in Offense and Defense, Invaluable　Looking at the skills of the two teams, the strength of the Hunan women's volleyball team, based on what has been seen from the preliminary rounds, is truly a superior force. Although the Shanghai team is well-known, with Hunan's complete offense and defense, they may also be wary and intimidated. The Malayan team, on the other hand, has no strengths, and their players are short, their serves are inappropriate, and their middle is weak, which is a fatal flaw.</p>
<h3>Soccer　Zhejiang and Qingdao Eliminated First, Hebei and Malaya Promoted Three Levels, Qingdao and Zhejiang Suffer Shutouts</h3>
<p>There were two soccer matches yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Hebei played against Qingdao. The Hebei team had veterans like Sun Sijing, Zhao Qichun, and Jiang Lu to support them, and Chen Erde, a famous goalkeeper from North China, joined the team, so they had nothing to worry about. They won 4-0. At 4:00 PM, Malaya played against Zhejiang. Zhejiang had the momentum of defeating Hunan, and although they expected to lose, they didn't think the score would be too far apart. In the end, they suffered a crushing defeat with a huge score difference and no ability to resist, which was very miserable. With Hebei and Malaya winning, they have entered the third week.</p>
<p>Hebei Defeats Qingdao　The soccer match between Hebei and Qingdao started at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Both sides had strong players from Hebei and Shandong, and their kicks were strong. However, Hebei had veterans like Sun Sijing who had been on the battlefield for a long time, while the Qingdao team was brave but lacked strategy, so they were no match for them. At the beginning of the game, Hebei's right forward, Zhang Deming, was agile and repeatedly dribbled the ball into the opponent's territory, but was saved by the Qingdao defenders. Then, they got a free kick opportunity, which was seized by Zhang, who took advantage of the opportunity and opened the scoring with one kick. Soon after, Hebei took a corner kick, and the Qingdao goalkeeper made a mistake. Another goal was scored in the chaos. Qingdao lost two goals in a row and tried hard to attack, but their defense was empty, and Hebei's left forward, Wei Lu, scored another goal, ending the first half with a score of 3-0. After the break, Qingdao changed players and tried hard to counterattack, and their morale was high. However, their cooperation was lacking, and they were sometimes invaded by the Hebei team. The Hebei team's shooting skills were poor, and they missed all three penalty kicks. In the end, the Qingdao team's morale was scattered, and Hebei scored another goal, ending the game with a score of 4-0. Hebei won decisively. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:</p>

<p>Malaya Overwhelms Zhejiang　The Zhejiang soccer team defeated Hunan in the preliminary round, and their skills seemed decent. Unexpectedly, they lost 12 goals to Malaya, which was beyond everyone's expectations. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the match began. After the Zhejiang team kicked off from the center line, the forwards swarmed into the Malayan defense. Unexpectedly, they missed a great opportunity. The entire Malayan team counterattacked, Yao Shenghua passed to Li Yiyao, who passed to Yin Jinzhen, who kicked the ball diagonally into the net, opening the scoring. Yao Shenghua got another assist from the center. Liu Yizhi accidentally tripped someone, and Xie Fuqing took the penalty kick and scored. Li Yiyao followed suit and scored two more goals, ending the first half with a score of 5-0. After the restart, Zhejiang was even more overwhelmed. Xie Fuqing got another penalty kick opportunity but missed. Li Yiyao immediately stepped up and broke the deadlock. Xie Qingfu made up for his mistake with a goal. Du Yachi scored a goal with a solo effort. Qingfu scored two more penalty kicks, scoring three goals in a row. Yao Shenghua completed a dozen goals, resulting in a total score of 12-0. Malaya won decisively. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Hebei Easily Defeats Jiangsu, A Disparity in Strength, 36 to 4, Guangdong vs. Shandong This Afternoon</h3>
<p>In the women's softball championship, Hebei played against Jiangsu yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM at the baseball field. Hebei, with their elite team, easily defeated Jiangsu with a score of 36-4. The ball referee was Hou Luoxun, the base referee was Cui Yalan, and the recorder was Xia Kaiming. Guangdong will play against Shandong in the semi-finals (A) at 1:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>A Vast Difference in Strength Between the Two Teams　Hebei has well-rounded talent, with a strong inside and outside. The pitcher, Lu Yunyan, taking over from Lu Fayan, is indeed a top choice. The sharpness of the pitches and the agility of the catches and throws are a perfect combination, not easy to come by. Cui Huixian is good at striking and has made three home runs individually, which will be a great contribution to this tournament. All the players who take the field score, and the benefits are equally distributed among all. Their strength is evident. The Jiangsu girls fight bravely and are lively in their attitude, but they suffer from unfamiliar skills and lack of experience. The pitcher, Yi Zhiyun, throws the ball softly and straight, and the catcher, Wan Shouzhen, is indecisive. It is difficult for their teammates to cooperate effectively. Only the central defender, Sun Defang, is outstanding, standing alone and adding color to the Hebei team. This is worth our attention.</p>
<p>The Seven-Inning Situation Formed a Collapse　When Hebei came on the field, Cui Huixian made a home run, and the Jiangsu defense was immediately disrupted. Huang Bulin and Huang Xiulian entered one after another. In the first inning, Hebei scored three points. In the second inning, Cui Huixian made another home run, and Hebei scored seven more points. In the third inning, they added two more points. In the fourth inning, Hebei launched a large-scale attack, and the Jiangsu defense was full of enemies. Eleven players ran back to base. In the fifth inning, more players returned! In the sixth inning, Lu Yunyan and Cui Huixian each made a home run, and the Hebei team returned to base in large numbers, a total of seven people. Finally, in the seventh inning, Hebei was still active. In total, they scored 36 points in the seven innings. This was Hebei's masterpiece. The Jiangsu team was overwhelmed by the overwhelming power and struggled to escape. Fortunately, in the fourth inning, Wan Shouzhen made a hit, occupying first base. Then, with Sun Huifang's hit, the two returned to the team at the same time, scoring two points, opening the scoring. In the sixth inning, Sun Huifang also returned due to a hit. In the seventh inning, Xu Shumin lived up to expectations and repeatedly attacked, achieving success and also scoring one point. As a result, Hebei won against Jiangsu 36 to 4.</p>

<h3>Memorial Week This Morning, 8 AM in the Gymnasium, Basketball Time Changed</h3>
<p>Today is Monday. At 8:00 AM, all staff and athletes of the conference will hold Memorial Week. The 8:00 AM basketball game has been changed to 11:00 AM. Liu Shishi, a famous Hong Kong backstroke swimmer, was unable to travel to Shanghai with the Hong Kong delegation due to work reasons. Chen Yuhui, a female player, was unable to travel because she participated in the South China Swimming Association. Now that the swimming competition is about to begin the day after tomorrow, Liu and Chen have taken the President Jackson ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 12th. They will arrive this afternoon. Liu holds the national record for the 100-meter backstroke at 1 minute and 21 seconds, which he set during the preliminary round of the 10th Far East Games in 1934. However, Liu's recent results have improved dramatically. His 100-yard time is only 69 seconds, and his 100-meter time is within 1 minute and 20 seconds. In this All-China Games, he and Yang Yaokun and Shi Jinping from Guangdong will have a fierce competition, and it is expected that a new record will be set.</p>
<h3>Wrestling Friendship Match, Mongolia vs. Beijing Today</h3>
<p>The eight wrestlers from Mongolia who came to the conference have attracted the attention of the audience. The wrestling team will hold a friendly match with Beijing wrestlers at 2:00 PM today, and then compete with Shanghai wrestlers. It will be a sensation.</p>
<h3>All Athletes Able to Visit All Venues Due to Team Leader Request</h3>
<p>The team leaders requested the organizing committee to allow all athletes to visit all competition venues. The organizing committee agreed that athletics events are open to all athletes, but the gymnasium, tennis venue, and swimming pool have limited capacity, so each team can send one-tenth of their athletes to visit each day.</p>
<h3>Great Increase in Ticket Sales Yesterday, Approximately 8,000 Yuan Sold</h3>
<p>Ticket revenue from the first day of the conference was 13,200 yuan. It decreased greatly in the second and third days to around 3,000 yuan per day. Yesterday was Sunday, and the number of spectators was slightly less than the first day. Approximately 8,000 yuan were sold.</p>
<h3>Interview with Pole Vaulting Expert, Wang He: Breaking the National Record Should Not Be a Problem</h3>
<p>In order to interview Wang He, who had twice defeated pole vaulting king Fu Baolu during training in Qingdao, I waited until 6:30 PM after the events ended before meeting him in the Shanghai athletes' dormitory. After I explained my purpose, he opened the conversation and said, "I practiced at the sports ground the past two days, jumping over 3 meters and 80 centimeters. I have been resting for the past four days in preparation for creating an excellent record tomorrow (i.e., today). As for breaking the national record, it should not be a problem." After he finished speaking, I said goodbye and left. Judging by the qualifications of the two pole vaulters, Fu Baolu, who scored points in the Far East Games, should be the winner. However, Wang He now has such strong strength, so who will win can only be determined by their performance today.</p>
<h3>Small Ball Exhibition at the National Games Scheduled for the 16th; Hubei Province vs. This City</h3>
<p>The small ball exhibition at the National Games, the first being a mixed team from Hubei versus this city, is scheduled for the afternoon of the day after tomorrow (16th) at 1 p.m. at the main stadium. It is reported that the Hubei team possesses strong players such as Jiang Chao, Wan Guorong, and Fu Zhishu, making their strength quite impressive. However, although the cooperation of this city's mixed team may be slightly lacking, the individual skills of its members are all top-notch. The competition at that time will definitely be a spectacle.</p>

<p>Men's and Women's National Martial Arts</p>
<h3>Men's and Women's National Martial Arts Enthusiastically Welcomed; Archery and Wrestling Finals Held Yesterday; Athletes from Beiping and Shanghai Shine; Mongolian Wrestling Troupe Performs Yesterday</h3>
<p>The men's and women's national martial arts competition was held for the fourth day yesterday. Starting at 9 a.m. at the martial arts arena, the archery finals for men and women were held. The women's group was held first, with the first place going to Wang Jiazhen from Hunan. The men's group followed, with the champion being Wang Fuhai from Beiping. Starting at 1 p.m., the wrestling finals for men and women were held, with interspersed wrestling performances by the Mongolian wrestling team. The results of the women's group final showed that the first place was won by Meng Jianli from Shanghai. It was originally scheduled that after the men's group final yesterday, Chu Minyi would perform Tai Chi ball and stick, but due to the lateness of the hour, it was postponed to this afternoon. The details of the competition and the results are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Various Sketches of the Competition</h3>
<p>Sisters from Henan Excel at Archery; The women's archery competition began at 10 a.m., followed by the men's archery competition. In the women's group, in addition to Wang Jiazhen, the representative of Hunan Province, who won first place, the second, third, and fourth places were all representatives of Henan Province. According to Liu Pixian, the deputy curator of the Henan Provincial Martial Arts Hall, who came to Shanghai with the team, Ma Ruilan and Ma Ruilian, who were selected for this archery competition, are both representatives of Henan Province. According to Liu Buxian, the deputy curator of the Henan Provincial Martial Arts Hall, who came to Shanghai with the team, the Ma sisters' father, Ma Renfu, was a "Wu Tanhua" (third scholar in the military examination) in the past, and is now the archery coach of the Kaifeng Equestrian Archery Association. He is famous throughout Henan Province, and many people have studied under him. Although the Ma sisters did not win the championship in this competition, the beauty of their posture was the best in the entire army. Therefore, the audience called them the "archery sisters." These sisters will also participate in the hard bow pulling performance today. That hard bow requires at least 200 pounds of strength to pull it open, so even for men, pulling this hard bow is not easy. Furthermore, the Ma sisters' mother, Ma Tianjunying, also came to Shanghai. Before the official start of the performance, she also performed on her own, and many of her arrows were able to hit the target, and her posture was also very good. These sisters are truly worthy of being the children of a military family.</p>
<p>Also, this afternoon in front of the podium, there will be a wrestling competition with the Beiping athletes to determine who is best. The Beiping athletes also have many brave warriors, such as Zhang Wenshan, who is tall and strong, weighing over 300 pounds, truly a hero of today. At that time, there will be a bloody battle, which will be even more exciting. Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan happened to be in Shanghai on official business and will also personally visit the podium this afternoon to watch this strange and rare sport.</p>
<p>Wrestling Performances; Continuous Applause; In the afternoon, the wrestling semi-finals and finals began. First, the women's group held the semi-finals, followed by the men's group's lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight semi-finals. Finally, the women's finals were held, and the Mongolian wrestling team also participated in the performance. The performance of the Mongolian wrestling team was generally the same. Each group of two would often perform a dance when they came on stage, and their clothes were unique in color and style. Therefore, when they danced, it added a lot of interest. When they wrestled, the two sides would often kick each other with their feet. Because they wore high boots, the sound of the kicks was quite interesting. Their physique was strong, and their arm and leg strength was also very strong. They would suddenly separate and suddenly come together, and their strength was very strong. When they fell to the ground, there was a loud bang, which was exceptionally loud and won the audience's applause. Chief Referee Chu, for the sake of seriousness, personally held a small command flag and directed on the field. The Mongolians showed their respect to him when they saw it.</p>
<p>Beautiful Iron Bull Meng Jianli Wins the Championship; Among the women's wrestling athletes, there was Meng Jianli, a representative from Shanghai, who won the championship with a hundred victories. The first opponent she encountered was Peng Shansi, an athlete from Hunan. Miss Jianli seemed to have no one in her eyes and used her hands to drag her forcefully. Although Miss Peng was dragged around for a week, she was not thrown to the ground. Then Miss Peng raised her foot and tried to hook Miss Jianli with it. Meng was caught off guard and almost suffered an accident. They held each other like this for a long time, and when the time was up, a whistle sounded to temporarily rest and continue the performance. Miss Jianli was even more determined to continue her efforts.</p>

<p>The Mongolian wrestling team's clothing is unique. At around 1 p.m., the Mongolian wrestling team, led by the head of the team, Si Jun, arrived at the venue, along with the Mongolian football team players. The uniqueness of the wrestling team's clothing attracted the attention of the entire venue. They had already changed out of their previous day's clothing and put on a set of wrestling clothes. The upper garment was made of black leather, and the collar, cuffs, and chest of the garment were studded with white copper nails in a spiral shape. The back was studded with round white copper longevity characters, and some had Buddha statues. The pants were red or white, and there were patterned designs. It is said that ordinary people are not allowed to touch their wrestling clothes, as touching them can easily provoke their anger and cause accidents. There was also a red and yellow striped ribbon around the neck, hanging straight down the chest. They wore long, high boots. According to a Mr. from the Mongolian Political Council who came with them, wrestling performances are very popular among the people of Mongolia, and there is also a sports meet every year, but its content is very different from those held in China. Its programs include wrestling, horseback riding, shooting, and archery. They do not pay attention to track and field and football teams.</p>
<p>Premier Wang will personally visit today. The athletes from the northern frontier, who have come from afar, have performed so many精(精, used in original text) performances. The general audience is白觀不(白觀不, used in original text). Therefore, today we plan to feast on the performances,神(神, used in original text), and surround and fight the enemy, but Peng was ultimately unable to support it and fell to the ground in defeat. At that time, Peng was already discouraged, and in the third round of the performance, she fell to the ground in less than a minute. When Miss Jianli came on stage for the second time, she faced Sheng Guiqiu, a representative from the same unit. Miss Jianli took advantage of her great victory and dragged her down as soon as she grabbed the corner of her clothes. She fought again, and it was the same. So Jianli succeeded and won the championship. Miss Jianli is from Wujin. She is beautiful and strong, and it can be said that her name matches her reality. She brought a lot of glory to the southerners. She graduated from the East Asia Sports College and was known as the "Beautiful Iron Bull" when she was in school. After graduation, she taught at Shangshang Cai Primary School on Edward Road in this city. Today, she ended her black版(版, used in original text) life and is in charge of household affairs at home.</p>
<p>A Fierce Battle Between Henan and Hunan; In the women's group final, Zheng (name not legible in source material) of Henan and Liu Yingyu of Hunan tore at each other. After a long time, each had one win and one loss, and it was difficult to determine who was better. Then, in the next two battles, the two fought fiercely, and neither was willing to show weakness. They held on for two minutes, and the whistle sounded, temporarily ending the battle. They fought five or six rounds like this, but there was still no winner or loser. All the referees were unable to decide the winner. Some suggested using a　　法(法, used in original text) to determine the winner. Referee 　Chu Minyi　(褚民誼, name partially illegible) for the sake of fairness, ordered them to extend the time once and fight to the death. So the two, even more exhausted, shouted and returned to the battlefield. The two grabbed each other and circled for a long time, but it was still difficult to determine the winner. Then Miss Zheng used her head to bump forward, and actually bumped Miss Liu out of the arena. The spectators all stood up to avoid her. Chief Referee Chu was unable to determine the winner, so he had a flash of inspiration and rushed forward to stop them, saying that whoever stepped out of the arena first would lose. So, a difficult battle was finally resolved. But although Miss Zheng won, she had exhausted her strength and had no will to fight. When she was about to fight Yin Peilan of Hunan, she initially planned to forfeit. After Chief Referee Chu explained the situation, she came out to fight, but gave up and fell to the ground in defeat in less than a round.</p>
<p>Athletes from Beiping Defeat Athletes from Beijing and Shandong; Among the men's group, their wrestling skills were very skillful, and because of their great strength, the battle was even more intense. When Zhang Qing, an athlete from Beiping, wrestled with Long Zhili, a representative from Beijing, Long first took the opportunity to twist Zhang's back. Zhang did not resist, but twisted the corner of Long's clothes and bowed his head to the ground, expecting Long to win. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly came up with a clever plan, using his head to push against Long's abdomen, holding Long's legs with both hands, and lifting his body up. Long had already somersaulted and fallen behind Zhang. In the second competition, Zhang still used the same trick, and Long was still caught off guard and fell to the ground in defeat. There was also the fat Zhang Wenshan, who was also an athlete from Beiping. His opponent was Ma Qinghe, an athlete from Shandong. Zhang stared fiercely, while Ma calmly responded to the battle. They held each other for a long time, and it was difficult to determine the winner. When they fought again in the second round, Zhang Wenshan used all his strength to twist Ma's back and lift him up. Ma was unable to stand firmly and was pushed to the ground by Zhang. When Ma fell to the ground, his foot accidentally touched Zhang's big belly. Zhang initially suspected that he had been intentionally ambushed, but after an explanation, he was relieved. After a short rest, they fought again. At this time, Ma tried to counterattack and kicked Zhang's foot forcefully, but Zhang still stood still. He then tried to twist Ma's body, but was also unable to succeed. What was even more difficult was that Zhang was fat and his clothes were small, and when Ma tried to twist the corner of Zhang's clothes, Zhang straightened up, and Ma was unable to twist it. Therefore, after two rounds of fighting, they were unable to make any progress, and according to the rules, Zhang was declared the winner.</p>
<h3>Ma, the Tanhua, Recalls the Past</h3>
<p>The women's archery athletes from Henan, Ms. Ma Ruilan and Ma Ruilian, are the daughters of Ma Renfu, and Guan Fenlan is his best student. This time, Mr. Ma led them to participate in the National Games. The result of yesterday morning's competition was that the total score of the unit was as high as 25 points, which can be said that there are no weak soldiers under a strong general. The reporter asked Mr. Ma about his origins in the Qing Dynasty. He said that he was from Yancheng County, Henan Province. He studied martial arts from a young age. After he became an adult, he obtained the first place in the "Juren" examination in the Ding You year of the Guangxu reign (1897), and the first place in the "Huishi" examination in the Wu Xu year of the Guangxu reign (1898). He only obtained the title of "Wu Tanhua" (third scholar in the military examination) during the palace examination. He is currently the chief archery coach of the Kaifeng Equestrian Archery Association. He focuses on training in horse archery. Most of the members of the association are soldiers, and so on.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi to Perform Today</h3>
<p>The Tai Chi ball and Tai Chi stick invented by Mr. Chu Minyi were originally scheduled to be performed at the martial arts arena yesterday afternoon, but later, due to the performance of the Mongolian wrestling team coming to Shanghai, there was not enough time, so it was rescheduled to be held this afternoon. According to Mr. Chu, this Tai Chi ball and stick was invented in 1929 and participated in the World Games held in Belgium in 1930, winning the highest honor award. The function of this Tai Chi ball and Tai Chi stick is to completely practice the pushing hands method. Because there are two people pushing hands in Tai Chi, now you can use a ball or stick, and one person can also push hands. The invention of this ball is derived from the sandbag, but the sandbag is used for punching, while the Tai Chi ball and Tai Chi stick are used for pushing. Currently, the number of people learning it in industry and commerce is gradually becoming more common.</p>
<h3>Results of the Women's Archery Group</h3>
<p>(Shooting Accuracy); Only eight women participated in archery. Except for Shi Xiulan from Qingdao, the rest were all from Hunan and Henan provinces. The participating athletes were all capable players who had been selected through several rounds. The distance was 20 meters, and the bow strength was 3 li or 2 li, depending on the athlete's convenience. As a result of the competition, Wang Jiazhen, a female general from the Hunan Martial Arts Hall, won the championship. Ms. Wang has strong hand strength and good eyesight, so she was able to shoot three arrows in a row and hit three bullseyes in a row. She is truly worthy of being a divine archer. Ma Ruilan and Ma Ruilian, two sisters from Henan, and Kou Fenlan, three ladies, are all students of Wu Tanhua Ma Renfu. They are quite skilled in walking archery. Therefore, although the championship was won by Hunan, the total score was still the highest for Henan. The results of the final showed that six people were selected, and their surnames, ranks, unit scores, and so on, are listed below:</p>
<p>Rankings; Name; Unit; Score</p>
<p>First Place; Wang Jiazhen; Hunan; Twelve</p>
<p>Second Place; Ma Ruilan; Henan; Ten</p>
<p>Third Place; Ma Ruilian; Henan; Nine</p>
<p>Fourth Place; Kou Fenlan; Henan; Six</p>
<p>Fifth Place; Gong Rangxian; Hunan; Five</p>
<p>Sixth Place; Huang Yunhui; Hunan; One</p>
<h3>Results of the Men's Archery Group (Shooting Accuracy)</h3>
<p>The situation during the preliminaries was that more men participated than women, with a total of 30 people. Therefore, the first competition was the preliminaries, including Xie Zhisheng, Zhang Yuan, Wang Chuanen, Li Feng, Ma Baozhen, Qiu Si , Sun Tao, Qiu Sishan, Chu Xingru, Shi Ming, Shao Wenming, Jia Zhishan, Li Heqing, Jiao Yulin, Wei Wenhai, Wang Zengliang, Liu Zhaoxun, Gao Yiren, Hai Zhiping, Zhao Butang, Li Jiafu, Yang Weixiu, Yang Weibo, Xie Maolin, Zhao Jilian, Weng Ting, Wang Fuhai, Li Zhenbang, and so on. As a result, only 13 people were selected.</p>
<p>A Speech Before the Finals; The following 13 people were selected from the preliminary results: Li Jiafu, Shao Wenming, Yang Bo, Wang Fuhai, Li Zhenbang, Ma Baozhen, Wang Zengliang, Zhao Tang, Zhao Qinglian, Li Heqing, Sun Shou, Li Fengshan, and Sheng Jiangxun. Then, referee Chu Minyi gave a speech to these 13 athletes, saying that the main thing in today's archery competition is to hit the target, but posture is also very important. In the first preliminary round just now, several athletes violated the rules in terms of posture. Now it is the final, and I hope everyone will pay attention to it. After the speech, the final began, and six people were selected as the final winners. Their surnames, ranks, and units are as follows:</p>

<h3>Today's Program Promises to Be Especially Exciting</h3>
<p>Although the preliminary rounds of the men's heavyweight, middleweight, and lightweight wrestling groups have ended, it was originally scheduled to hold the finals again yesterday, but due to the lateness of the hour, it was not possible to hold them, so they have been postponed to today. Mr. Chu Minyi's Tai Chi Copper Ball Boxing performance has also been changed to be performed today. Therefore, today's national martial arts program is as follows: archery (long-distance shooting) (at the baseball field) for men and women in the morning at 9 a.m., preliminary rounds of single apparatus for men and women in the afternoon, wrestling finals for men's lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight, and the three winners of the men's and women's archery (shooting accuracy) and women's wrestling will be led by the national martial arts team to the podium at 1 p.m. for a photo and award ceremony.</p>
<p>Tan Meiguan Performs Bicycle Stunts (International News Agency and Wang Kai Photo)</p>
<h3>Tan Meiguan's Bicycle Performance; Excellent Technique</h3>
<p>Tan Meiguan, an overseas Chinese from Vietnam, took the opportunity of the conference to return to China to present his skills and perform bicycle stunts. There are 23 types of stunts, and the table performance, using hands instead of feet, walking on the plum blossom piles, and balancing the bike on wine bottles are the most valuable. On a small square platform of less than two feet in size, he actually drove the bike on the platform, letting go of his hands or standing or lying down as if on flat ground. The audience all marveled in admiration. His skill in driving is as skilled as ordinary people playing with bamboo, watching his lightness and flexibility, without any obstacles. It is not possible to be competent without several years of hard work. Our overseas Chinese's divine skill is also worth seeing.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of the Conference; Zhu Jiaju Holds a Banquet for the Team Leaders, etc.</h3>
<p>At 6 p.m. last night, Zhu Jiaju held a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant for the important officials of the conference and the team leaders. Mr. Zhu presided over the banquet and gave a welcoming speech. Everyone dispersed happily at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Last Night's Entertainment at the Conference</p>
<p>The conference held a variety show last night for the third day at the gymnasium, which was a film screening.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Federation Will Welcome</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Federation will hold a tea party at the cafeteria of the YMCA at 8 Immortals Bridge on the afternoon of the 15th (Tuesday) at 5 p.m. to welcome the units and team leaders.</p>
<p>Sichuan Team Distributes Sports Slogans</p>
<p>The Sichuan athletes' team printed 80 colorful slogans and distributed them at the venue, and also sent them to the team leaders of each unit. The team's slogans clearly pointed out various propositions of Chinese sports and future trends and are quite meaningful.</p>
<p>Methods for Presale of Swimming Tickets</p>
<p>The conference announced the detailed methods for presale of swimming tickets as follows. The swimming competition will start on the 16th. There are not many seats, and it is bound to be crowded at that time. The conference has specially ordered the following methods for presale of tickets. 1. A long-term ticket for the swimming pool is six yuan (from October 16 to 20), which will be sold at the following locations starting today: (1) Shanghai China Travel Service (Sichuan Road) and its branches, (2) Shanghai Municipal Bank Head Office (Tianjin Road), South Branch (South City Minguo Road and West Branch (Old West Gate), (3) Ticket booth No. 2 at the conference venue (in front of the West Main Gate). 2. There are three types of temporary tickets for the swimming pool every day: (1) 1.50 yuan (if the 6 yuan long-term tickets have been sold out, then these temporary tickets will not be sold), (2) 1 yuan (these temporary tickets will be sold the day before), (3) 6 jiao (these temporary tickets will be sold the day before). 3. The locations for selling the above three types of temporary tickets: (1) Shanghai China Travel Service (Sichuan Road) and its branches, (2) Shanghai Municipal Bank (Tianjin Road), South Branch (South City Minguo Road) and West Branch (Old West Gate), (3) Swimming pool ticket booth at the conference venue. 4. Shanghai China Travel Service and its branches, Shanghai Municipal Bank and its branches will sell tickets the day before and on the day from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. (for example, tickets for the 15th will be sold all day on the 14th and from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on the 15th). All unsold swimming tickets will be sold separately at the swimming pool ticket booth in front of the main gate of the conference venue until they are sold out.</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Tennis Court</h3>
<p>The female tennis players from Malaya wear rouge and lipstick, quite like movie stars. The female tennis players from Sichuan wear woolen suits, which are extremely neat and have the air of young mistresses. The players from Beijing, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Anhui are purely rustic and extremely simple.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji and his brother Xu Chengwei's doubles match the day before yesterday was warmly supported by the spectators. After the match, they were surrounded by the audience and asked for autographs for as long as a quarter of an hour. Now that this trend has started, after Chengji and Xu Weipei's singles match today, even more people asked for autographs. The referee Gao Cheng was also surrounded. Ling Daoyang was unable to come down, so he was also trapped, and his anxious state was comical.</p>
<p>The Wang sisters, the tennis flowers of Shanxi, were most noticed by the audience. Before the start of their doubles match yesterday, they were constantly surrounded by "cameras." When the competition started, hundreds of people holding cameras rushed into the arena like shock troops, surrounding the Wang sisters in layers. As a result, the crowd was unable to focus the light, and nothing was accomplished. The two sisters, in a state of shock, took the opportunity to break through and escape.</p>
<p>The tennis competition is gradually becoming more intense, so the audience is growing day by day. Yesterday, Xu Chengji and Xu Weipei's singles match attracted an even larger audience. The bleachers were not enough to hold them, and the head of the security team personally came forward and sent a large number of police officers and dozens of Boy Scouts to the scene to suppress the crowd, and the order was well maintained.</p>
<p>Among the male and female tennis players, there are two pairs who are siblings, and their skills are also outstanding, and they are sure to win the championship in this competition. It can be said that they are a perfect match. They are the Wang Chunqing and Chunwei sisters from Shanxi, and the Xu Chengji and Chengwei brothers from Java. They have been inseparable in recent days and are very affectionate. It is truly a beautiful story in the National Games. Their age, physique, and tennis skills all meet the standards. The reporter sincerely wishes them success.</p>
<p>Many of the female tennis players do not speak Chinese. The Wang sisters from Shanxi are young, and the Wei sisters from Shanghai are from McGuffey. One is because their mother is Western, and the other is because they were overseas students. The female players from Malaya not only cannot speak, but also cannot write Chinese. Most of the male players speak English, so the tennis court has a foreign flavor.</p>
<h3>International Football Match; Tentative Mixed Lineup; Confrontation with Western Union on the 20th; The Lineup May Be Temporarily Changed</h3>
<p>There are a total of 19 teams participating in this year's football competition. It is still difficult to know what the final result will be, but the strongest teams are the four regions of Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Malaysia. Their football skills are indeed superior to others. In order to increase the audience's interest, the conference has scheduled an international match to be held on the afternoon of the 20th before the closing of the conference. Secretary-General Shen Siliang met with football king Li Huitang yesterday to discuss the matter. It was proposed that after the closing ceremony, the National Sports Association should select famous players from each region to form a strong team to compete with the Western Union team, in preparation for attending the World Games in the future. According to the results of the discussion, an ideal lineup has been tentatively determined, but in the future, the champion team will still have an advantage, and the lineup can be slightly changed. The ideal lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai, Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Cai Wenli, Xu Yahui, Du Zhiquan</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng, Chen Zhenhe, Li Huitang, Sun Jinshun, Zheng Jiliang</p>

<h3>The Study Burden and Teaching Time of Middle School Students (1)</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Currently, it is generally felt that the study burden on middle school students is too heavy. Middle school students are generally busy with their studies from morning till night, to the point where their health is damaged and their bodies are weakened. Those concerned with education should not ignore the seriousness of this problem, but should conduct thorough investigations and detailed analyses, and engage in research, without superficial observations and erroneous reasoning. Currently, people generally believe that the heavy study burden on middle school students is due to the excessive teaching time in current middle schools. This cannot be said to be anything other than a mistake. Upon closer inspection, the origin of this error stems from roughly three causes. First, it is based on the reports of a few individuals who are not representative. For example, in a recent article in the Ta Kung Pao by a Mr. Chen titled "Save Middle School Students," he cited the words of a certain middle school student and a certain teacher. Drawing a conclusion about the excessive study time of current middle school students and its various harms based on the reports of four or five students and teachers is, inevitably, based on weak evidence. Even if the examples cited are not extreme cases, it is difficult to see any representativeness, except for the author's own insistence on adding the phrase "representative" when citing examples. Second, there is a lack of clear understanding of the system itself. For example, the current middle school curriculum standards clearly stipulate that the total number of hours for high school students' daily classes, self-study, and extracurricular activities is ten hours, within which one hour is for morning exercises and extracurricular activities. However, the author of "Save Middle School Students" insists on saying, "High school students have ten hours of classes and self-study every day, totaling sixty hours per week, and the one hour of morning exercises each day is not included..." This is somewhat akin to "deliberately accusing someone of wrongdoing." Regarding various middle school regulations, anyone with a clear understanding of the true nature of middle schools knows that there are absolutely no morning exercises of such long duration. Criticizing a system in this way, however "sternly," is regrettably not "justly righteous." Third, unreasonable realities are confused with the system itself. For example, the current regulations for junior high school mathematics stipulate four hours per week for the first grade, five hours per week for the second and third grades, four hours per week for the first grade of high school, three hours per week for the second grade, four hours per week for the first semester of the third grade, and two hours per week for the second semester. However, in reality, schools often arbitrarily increase these hours, and by a significant amount. In the article "Save Middle School Students," a middle school student's report is also mentioned, which is the only truly representative example among those cited as "representative" in the article. He said that in his school, there are an average of six to eight hours of mathematics every day. This is a far cry from the regulations. I believe that this student is unlikely to be lying, but the principal and teachers of that school are going crazy. They must be using a "cramming" method to deal with students for some purpose, perhaps for the college entrance examination. Last year, I participated in a tour of various middle schools in the capital to investigate the curriculum. As a result, it can be said that there were almost no schools that strictly followed the regulations regarding the number of hours. In general, they were all increased, and the most extreme had up to forty-eight hours of teaching time per week. This is an astonishing thing. No wonder it makes young people dizzy and causes society to curse middle schools. However, this is an unreasonable reality, and the system cannot be held responsible for it. How can it prevail over it?</p>

<h3>Important Information for Quitting Smoking (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhongming</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Since the entry of opium into our country, the scourge of smoking has spread like wildfire. From high-ranking officials to common laborers, the number of addicts is countless. They are generally emaciated and mentally exhausted. How can such a nation, when facing a nation that forges itself, not fail? As the saying goes, things must rot from within before insects breed. We are clear about blaming others but obscure about blaming ourselves. Why blame others for our own decline?</p>
<p>From the late Qing dynasty to the founding of the Republic of China, people in society, deeply concerned about the increasing spread of the poison, loudly called out and strongly argued against the harms of smoking. However, those in power were constrained by financial difficulties and were unable to fully implement prohibitions. Those below saw the government's procrastination on smoking bans and delayed taking action themselves. Therefore, smoking ban laws were treated as insignificant.</p>
<p>Until recently, since the National Government promulgated a six-year ban plan, addicts have begun to feel the strictness of the law, which is very different from the past. They are now in a state of panic, feeling like they cannot continue like this. They are constantly thinking about effective and miraculous remedies to serve as rafts for the sea of suffering. My writing of this piece is also intended to provide those with addiction with a reference.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Nature of Opium</p>
<p>Opium is a brownish-yellow gelatinous substance or powder, belonging to the category of pseudo-alkaline narcotics. It is extracted from the juice inside the capsules of poppy flowers. It tastes bitter and has a distinctive odor. It is soluble in water or alcohol. It contains the most important component, morphine, which accounts for about 12%, as well as other pseudo-alkaline substances. It is produced in the Balkan Peninsula of Europe, Egypt in Africa, and Persia and India in Asia. Recently, our country has also been widely cultivating it. The various effects of opium smoking on the body and mind are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Effects on the Nervous System</p>
<p>Opium is essentially a neurotoxin, so its effects on the nervous system are particularly strong. Those who are new to smoking opium, even in small quantities such as one or two pipes (each pipe containing about a tenth of an ounce), will feel mentally happy, their worries will disappear, and their limbs will feel unusually comfortable. Therefore, scholars often use it to stimulate literary inspiration, and busy individuals rely on it to recover from fatigue. Those in the leisure class rely on it even more as the only mental comfort to numb their bodies and minds. As a result, they lie horizontally on their beds, immersed in the misty landscape of opium. The taste of it is something that outsiders cannot imagine. Young people are easily tempted by opium, and the reason for this is based on this.</p>
<p>However, beautiful scenes do not last, and grand banquets cannot be repeated. The days of mental happiness are when exhaustion is secretly lurking. The effects of anesthesia are limited to a few hours. Once the effects have passed, the fatigue on the body and mind remains the same, or even feels more tired than before smoking. Those who are new to smoking are constantly thinking about smoking again, hoping to maintain their excited state of mind forever. However, over time, they become increasingly addicted to opium.</p>
<p>Once an opium addiction is formed, the smoker's suffering increases day by day. The pleasant emotions of the past gradually disappear. On the one hand, after the nerves have been anesthetized for a long period of time, a large amount of opium is required to stimulate the already weakened spirit. On the other hand, they are intimidated by the power of opium and can no longer control themselves. Therefore, the amount smoked increases with time. Those who can limit themselves to small amounts and not exceed them are extremely rare.</p>
<p>As for the mental aspect, after being extremely anesthetized, abnormal changes also occur. In most cases, the mind is颓唐 (tuí táng, depressed), and the will is wavering. The courage of youth and grand plans all disappear. In severe cases, symptoms such as palpitations and insomnia also occur in many cases.</p>
<p>(2) Effects on the Digestive System</p>
<p>The digestive system refers to the collective term for the stomach and intestines. The intestines are further divided into the large intestine and the small intestine. Normally, food first collects in the stomach. After the first stage of gastric digestion, it begins to flow into the small intestine. In the middle, it undergoes a second stage of intestinal digestion. As a result, the nutritional components of the food gradually transform into nutrients suitable for the human body, which are then absorbed by the small intestine and transported into the blood, spreading throughout the body. As for the fecal matter discharged from the large intestine, most of it is food residue, which has no nutritional value. The ability to propel food from top to bottom is based on the peristalsis of the stomach and intestines. (Note: The term "peristalsis" describes the movement of earthworms. The movement of the stomach and intestines is quite similar, so it is also named after it). During digestion, peristalsis is quite strong. After digestion is complete, the stomach and intestines are calm. This phenomenon can be observed in detail using X-rays. In general, stronger peristalsis often causes diarrhea, while slower peristalsis easily leads to constipation.</p>
<p>Opium has the effect of stopping the peristalsis of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, smokers suffer from constipation. Those who smoke small amounts may have a bowel movement once every two or three days. In severe cases, they must wait five or six days until they can have a bowel movement by using enemas or laxatives.</p>
<p>Originally, constipation is the source of all diseases. This is because the maintenance of human health depends on moderation in diet and regular bowel movements (once a day). If the bowels cannot move regularly, the residue contained in the intestines easily transforms into toxic substances. Additionally, after the intestinal tract is blocked for a long period of time, the descent of food is also hindered. Therefore, smokers are extremely emaciated and lack appetite. Although the reason is due to insufficient nutrition, the effects of poisoning are also related.</p>
<p>Furthermore, smokers often boast that opium helps digestion. In fact, this is not true. Opium has the effect of stopping peristalsis, as mentioned above. Therefore, after smoking, the peristalsis of the stomach immediately stops. With peristalsis stopped, the capacity of the stomach also expands. The so-called relief of bloating is the result of the stomach cavity expanding and has nothing to do with the problem of digestion. This is also something that should be noted.</p>
<p>(3) Effects on the Circulatory System</p>
<p>After the heart is anesthetized by opium, the pulse becomes slow. The blood vessels in the brain and skin expand. Therefore, those who are new to smoking often feel a swelling sensation in the head and heat or itching in the limbs. As the opium addiction deepens, this phenomenon gradually disappears. After prolonged anesthesia, the heart becomes extremely weak. It is often unable to withstand attacks from external diseases, and countless deaths are caused as a result.</p>
<p>(4) Effects on the Respiratory System</p>
<p>The lungs are the organs that first come into contact with opium. All inhaled smoke must first pass through the blood vessels of the lungs before spreading throughout the body. After the lungs are anesthetized, breathing becomes slow and prolonged. Therefore, after smoking, one often feels at peace. Additionally, opium toxins can cause chronic bronchitis. The symptoms of bronchitis are coughing and phlegm, but opium has a cough-suppressing effect, so there is phlegm but no severe coughing.</p>
<h3>Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(67) Stomatitis</p>
<p>Stomatitis refers to the redness, swelling, and increased secretion of the oral mucosa. In colloquial terms, it is called "heatiness." This is an oversimplified explanation. There are many types of stomatitis. They are commonly divided into catarrhal stomatitis, ulcerative stomatitis, aphthous stomatitis, parasitic stomatitis, gangrenous stomatitis, and purulent stomatitis. They are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Catarrhal Stomatitis</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The causes of catarrhal stomatitis are mostly due to thermal, mechanical, and chemical irritations. Or it may be due to occupational factors, or it may be caused by the spread of inflammation from the teeth, pharynx, or nasal cavity. Or it may be secondary to infectious diseases and systemic diseases. Now, let's discuss them separately.</p>
<p>(1) Thermal irritation = such as excessively cold or hot foods. (2) Mechanical irritation = such as sharp teeth and the eruption of teeth. (3) Chemical irritation = such as internal or external use of iodine agents, arsenic agents, lead agents, and mercury agents. (4) Occupational factors = such as inhaling copper powder, hydrochloric acid, and ammonia. (5) Infectious diseases = such as typhoid fever, measles, scarlet fever, smallpox, erysipelas, tuberculosis, and syphilis. (6) Systemic diseases = such as gout, diabetes, uremia, chlorosis, anemia, leukemia, and cancerous tumors.</p>
<p>In addition, stomatitis in alcoholics and smokers is caused by the irritation of alcohol and smoke. Stomatitis in children is caused by failure to clean the mouth after breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of this disease are obvious redness and swelling in the buccal mucosa and gums. Tooth impressions can be seen on the tongue threads and buccal mucosa. Saliva secretion is particularly strong. There is often a thick coating on the tongue and bad breath. The oral mucosa on the outside of the tongue is often white. Sometimes small blisters develop. Once the blisters rupture, they become shallow ulcers. Patients mostly feel burning pain in their mouths, which often makes eating difficult. They also complain of a constant bitter or rotten taste. This is because food and saliva decompose.</p>
<p>The course of this disease depends on the cause. Acute cases can be treated in a few days, while chronic cases may take years to treat. The treatment principle is: first, avoid thermal, mechanical, chemical, and alcohol irritations; second, immediately treat inflammation of the teeth, pharynx, and nasal cavity; third, ensure that the mouth is kept very clean. Rinse the mouth with medicinal solutions. If children cannot rinse their mouths, use medicinal solutions to wash their mouths. All medicinal solutions should be prescribed by a doctor.</p>
<h3>Tooth Common Sense Q&amp;A (5)</h3>
<p>— Lin Yixian</p>
<p>(Question 22) During the period when deciduous teeth are to be replaced, it is certainly not good to keep them. However, if they are lost several years early, before the replacement period, is there any harm?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are three harms: (1) Missing teeth cause inconvenience in chewing and impair digestion, which affects the health of children. (2) Because there are gaps, the neighboring deciduous teeth or the permanent teeth that are erupting will gradually tilt and move forward, occupying the space. This will eventually cause the permanent teeth that should have erupted to have their position occupied and can only grow sideways or slant forward, resulting in uneven teeth that are sparse and dense, improper upper and lower bite, and reduced chewing efficiency. The harm is even greater than what was said in the previous Q&amp;A. (3) It will shorten the alveolar bone, and the face will become uneven.</p>
<p>(Question 23) As parents, how should they pay attention to their children's deciduous teeth?</p>
<p>(Answer) Children should be taught to brush their teeth to avoid tooth decay. If there are cavities, they should be filled by a dentist. Unless absolutely necessary, they should not be extracted early. Also, pay attention to the replacement period of each tooth mentioned above. When they are loose, they should be extracted immediately and not allowed to remain. In this way, permanent teeth can grow neatly and beautifully, benefiting the child for life. Many parents think that deciduous teeth are temporary anyway and do not protect them, allowing them to be lost early. This is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Section 2: The Growth of Permanent Teeth</p>
<p>(Question 24) After the first permanent molars erupt at the age of six, when do the other teeth erupt?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the first permanent molars erupt at the age of six, the central incisors erupt around the age of seven. The lateral incisors erupt around the age of eight. The first premolars erupt around the age of nine. The second premolars erupt around the age of ten. The canines erupt around the age of eleven or twelve (the lower canines often erupt one or two years earlier). The second molars erupt around the age of thirteen. The third molars erupt around the age of seventeen or eighteen (but these teeth often erupt later).</p>
<p>(Question 25) How are permanent teeth arranged?</p>
<p>(Answer) Counting from the midline inward: (1) central incisor, (2) lateral incisor, (3) canine, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) first molar, (7) second molar, (8) third molar. The upper and lower jaws on the left and right sides are arranged in this way. The entire mouth has a total of thirty-two teeth.</p>
<h3>Mr. Molière and the Medical Profession</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>I reside on Rue Molière, allow me to speak of Mr. Molière:</p>
<p>Mr. Molière was a great French poet, one of the literary giants of 17th century Europe. He was famous for his plays and poetry. His art of satire can be described as extremely sharp. In light of the charlatan behavior of quack doctors at the time, he used a cold, sarcastic attitude to gradually depict their dark secrets. Many of Molière's works belonged to this category. However, because of Molière's works, society became aware of the dark side of the medical profession at the time. In reality, Molière only depicted quack doctors, but society viewed the entire medical profession in the same way! As a result, lawmakers also took notice! They created many legal provisions related to medicine! In this way, while doctors' mistakes decreased, their courage to provide emergency care and their spirit of experimentation were also significantly restricted!</p>
<p>"Failure is the mother of success. Before every successful doctor becomes famous, who can avoid unintentional mistakes and failures? After each mistake, one learns a lesson and gains experience. The more experience one has, the fewer mistakes one makes! Although mistakes are caused by the doctor's lack of knowledge and experience, the vast majority are due to bold attempts and enthusiastic efforts to save lives. These kinds of mistakes arise from academic and ethical considerations. They are not intentional killings, but rather equivalent to saving someone from drowning. There is no animosity between the doctor and the patient. Why would one intentionally kill them? Reputation is a person's second life. Why would one sacrifice it? Considering reason and logic, does that make sense? Therefore, the word 'intentional' cannot be added to the word 'mistake.' Except for abortion, almost no mistake is intentional. Thus, a doctor's unintentional mistake is an academic and conscience issue, not a legal one! Since the increase in medical malpractice lawsuits in recent years, doctors have become particularly cautious when treating patients. Even when faced with critical symptoms, although they want to enthusiastically and boldly try certain emergency methods, the legal provisions for intentional homicide are vividly present before them. As a result, their courage is diminished! Everyone is being cautious, not daring to deviate from the norm in the slightest. Those doctors who have been sued are even more frightened, with specialized obstetricians not daring to perform deliveries! Specialized surgeons not daring to perform even minor operations! The more obstacles doctors face, the more carefully they defend themselves. If this continues, I fear that in the future, no doctor will dare to treat dangerous illnesses. Alas! Who is to blame for this?</p>
<p>Because Molière's works influenced the French medical profession, I was reminded of the results of medical disputes in China. My rambling thoughts may contain a bit of truth!</p>
<h3>Medical Science for Pain Relief (36)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Addicts who have made up their minds or are forced to quit should preferably go to a hospital for proper and safe treatment. If done at home, it is often abandoned halfway. The principles for quitting smoking and drugs are as follows: (1) Those with strong bodies and less severe addictions can adopt the direct quitting method. (2) Initially, use tranquilizers to replace narcotics, keeping the addict in a dazed state for several days, because the most intense period of addiction is the first few days. (3) After the narcotics are removed, any old ailments that are discovered should be treated immediately with other appropriate methods, never using narcotics again. Most of the ailments during the drug period were originally in the body but were covered up by the narcotics. Now that the narcotics are removed, the old ailments are rediscovered. (4) Those with long-term addictions and very weak bodies should adopt the gradual reduction method. (5) During the detoxification period, some may need stimulants, such as those to strengthen the heart, assist breathing, or other stimulating drugs. (6) The most important task after quitting is to nourish the body. Nourishment methods include nutritious food, special attention to personal hygiene, and taking blood-tonifying and body-strengthening medicines. Now that there are safe methods for quitting, it is time for fellow compatriots who have been harmed by drugs for a long time to turn back.</p>
<h3>Analgesics (or Pain Relievers)</h3>
<p>This type of medicine occupies the most important position among all medicines, and it is also the type with the widest sales. Worldwide sales are easily over ten thousand yuan every year. It is unknown how many people rely on these drugs for their lives. The raw materials for analgesics are no more than a few dozen, but the types of medicines formulated from these raw materials are numerous, not less than several hundred. The purpose of this article is not to solicit business for pharmaceutical companies, nor is it intended to ruin their business, but to clarify the proper uses of analgesic drugs in scientific medicine, to reduce human suffering and improve human health. All explanations are not based on my own ideas, but are indeed based on expert experiments and writings.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (70)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Section 2 Rest and Nutrition</p>
<p>Besides fresh air, there are two things that are necessary for treating this disease, which patients should pay close attention to: one is the importance of physical rest, and the other is the necessity of rich nutritional food. The details of both are now described separately below:</p>
<p>Why should patients with this disease rest quietly? We know that pulmonary tuberculosis is a type of inflammatory lesion. The general rule for treating inflammation is to keep the affected area at rest so that scarring can occur quickly. For example, in cases of ulcers or external wounds, doctors must apply bandages and make the patient lie down. Pulmonary tuberculosis is no exception. Therefore, patients must rest quietly so that the newly formed connective tissue can completely surround the lesions to promote successful scarring. This is the sole purpose of quiet rest. Based on this reason, then, the claim that so-called deep breathing exercises and various sports (including the national martial arts generally believed in by the public) are beneficial to patients with this disease is obviously nonsense!</p>
<p>The importance of quiet rest has been described above. Then, how should patients rest quietly? First: For patients with elevated temperature, they should lie down all day. This method seems plain and unremarkable, but in fact, it must be done meticulously. Daily conversations and visits from relatives and friends should be strictly limited. As for writing letters, reading books, deep breathing, meditation, and other things, all are harmful and should be absolutely abandoned. After the temperature returns to normal, it is relatively more flexible, but it should not be done too hastily. It is best to have everything guided by a doctor. Second: For patients whose temperature is not currently elevated, the rules for quiet rest are certainly not as strict as the former! However, in addition to nighttime sleep, there should also be several scheduled rest times during the day, roughly one or two hours before and after lunch and before dinner. Going to bed no later than 10 PM at night, and this must be consistently followed. The intake of fresh air outdoors should also be scheduled every day, preferably lying horizontally in a deck chair. In addition, things like outdoor walks, reading books, and conversations can of course be allowed to a certain extent within a certain range. However, there must be a clear understanding of the patient's general condition and the details of the lesions before deciding whether to allow them. Reading books and newspapers that describe emotions excessively is most inappropriate. Many patients cannot tolerate these various rules of quiet rest; especially if the place of recuperation is very close to their own home, this kind of lonely bed life is almost completely impossible. This requires the patient to have sufficient determination and perseverance to abandon everything and strictly follow the rules. If it is really impossible to do it in one's own home, then there is only one way to enter a sanatorium and have a doctor supervise the implementation; one must not be perfunctory and make mistakes.</p>
<p>For children with progressive disease, it is of course impossible to implement the above-mentioned quiet rest rules in practice, but the principle is exactly the same. In clear weather, letting children sleep peacefully outdoors so that they can take in fresh air is also one of the very important treatments for this disease.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Tolerance</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>I happened to go with a friend to see a large-scale wedding. After watching it, the friend suddenly expressed the sentiment that he would rather remain unmarried for a hundred lifetimes. He was unwilling to say the reason for his sentiment, but it was probably because, in comparison, every bride had her weaknesses, and he felt that the hope of finding an ideal partner was indeed quite slim. This sentiment will not last long, because a person may not often have the opportunity to act as such a purely objective observer, and even if he tries his best to maintain an objective attitude and observe carefully, the result may not be the same as the general impression.</p>
<p>People usually think that naturalistic writers specialize in exposing people's weaknesses, but this is really a misunderstanding. Naturalistic works certainly do not have ideal, lovable characters that approach perfection like those in romantic works, but neither do they have purely ugly characters that are so ideal. Although we often feel that the characters in naturalistic works are ridiculous and ridiculed, we cannot infer that the author had a ridiculing intention when writing.</p>
<p>There are indeed writers who specialize in finding ridiculous characters to describe. But they often reveal their deliberate affectation. The Travels of Lao Ts'an and The Scholars both ridicule corrupt scholars, but the village schoolteacher in The Travels of Lao Ts'an only makes people feel that he is a fabricated joke, while the characters like Ma Chunshang in The Scholars are real people. When we see them in real life, we do not necessarily find them funny until they are written about. The difference between the reader and the author is only because the author's observation is more complete, not because the author is better at discovering their ridiculousness. From today's perspective, Yu Yude is almost as ridiculous as Ma Chunshang, but the author probably never intended Yu Yude to become an object of ridicule. However, since he was drawn as a model, every model inevitably has its ridiculousness.</p>
<p>A person's character always combines shortcomings and strengths. If the author can truthfully write about their shortcomings without exaggerating them, then he must also truthfully write about their strengths. Whether a work can have this tolerance often reveals whether its ridicule is malicious. Great writers generally do not write with malice. A friend once talked to me about Zola. He believed that Zola's greatness lies in his generosity. I have not read many of Zola's works, so I certainly do not understand this sentence very well. But if L'Assommoir and Nana can be regarded as representatives of Zola's works, then this statement is quite credible.</p>
<p>I always liked Chekhov's play The Seagull very much. What caught my attention the most was Philan, the expatriate. Although that person was degenerate, depressed, and almost beyond redemption, he was also quite clever and insightful, making people still feel that he was lovable. Such people are commonly seen in Western works and are also very common in Chinese society, but it seems that few people write them into their works.</p>
<p>From what I have seen personally, Old Man Ding in Divorce can be said to belong to this type. This book can be said to end with the miracle done by Old Man Ding. This miracle is inevitably a bit abrupt, but the thorough human touch of Old Man Ding is fully revealed even before the success of this miracle. The author of Divorce is very fond of exploring human touch, but the human touch of characters like Brother Zhang is always covered by his humor, while it is contrasted very clearly in Old Man Ding.</p>
<p>From Old Man Ding, one can easily think of Kong Yiji. The proper ending for this person is probably just like Kong Yiji. Whether or not a little brilliance should be painted on Kong Yiji's image is naturally a question, but if we feel that the treatment of Kong Yiji is already different from the treatment of Ah Q, then we may as well say that the author had a more generous tendency when writing Kong Yiji.</p>
<h3>Singapore Port (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>——A Record of Returning from the South——</p>
<p>When the ship arrived at the dock in Singapore, the passengers had to flock ashore to buy things or visit the nearby attractions. Only those unemployed workers who were being sent back to their country and a few prisoners being deported remained on board, watched over by the local police.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man, who had been sleeping in the hold, had been deported for breaking the law. As soon as the ship stopped, he opened his eyes and climbed onto the deck. Seeing the streets, buildings, and coconut groves in the distance bathed in the scorching sun, seemingly glowing, he raised his hands and shouted happily:</p>
<p>"Heh heh, Singapore!"</p>
<p>According to his old habits, he was about to wave his hands a few more times, but suddenly he saw the Malay devil in uniform standing proudly on the railing, staring at him, so he gently lowered his hands and stopped speaking.</p>
<p>Just then, the middle-aged fat merchant opened his umbrella and walked towards the escalator leading to the dock. Seeing this situation, he tilted his head and glanced at the young man who often spouted literary phrases on the way, as if gloating, and deliberately said loudly:</p>
<p>"Let's go ashore. Don't you want to take a look? You're strange. We'll be stopping for half a day. Are you going to sit here and be imprisoned?"</p>
<p>The young man had been leaning against the ship's railing, gazing at the shore. Hearing him call out, he followed him. When they arrived at the dock where rice bags and coconuts were being transported, the middle-aged fat merchant turned his head and glanced at the ship, with a mocking look on his face.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man silently spat on the ground below, then immediately turned back, showing an expression of disdain.</p>
<p>Over there, the old man was sitting diagonally, wrapping his bare feet with old felt. He used knowing eyes to point out some of the towering buildings, clock towers, and Flagstaff Hill to the Burmese woman and child beside him, as if introducing old friends. Like the pockmarked young man, he was being deported for breaking the law, and he had his family with him.</p>
<p>Next to them, street vendors were selling noodles and clam soup that had just been brought on board. Some of the passengers who had not gone ashore were eagerly buying and eating, and the scene was very lively.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man walked over and seriously shouted:</p>
<p>"Old man, my treat."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>The old man put down the hand he had been using to point out the sights on the shore and used it to scratch his waist instead, asking with a look of disbelief,</p>
<p>"Aren't you hungry? ... Who's trying to fool you?"</p>
<p>After the pockmarked young man said this seriously, he swallowed a big gulp of saliva.</p>
<p>The old man had long been disturbed by the atmosphere of people eating snacks around him. Seeing that the pockmarked young man didn't seem to be joking, he glanced at the steaming clam soup, licked his lips, and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, don't treat us to anything else, just a few bowls of clam soup!"</p>
<p>He also handed a bowl to his little child, who sniffled.</p>
<p>"Bah, what's the point of eating clam soup? ... If I'm going to treat, I'm going to treat you to something good. Let's go!"</p>
<h3>Standing on a Line</h3>
<h3>On the Beach</h3>
<p>— Nanyun</p>
<p>Arrived in Tokyo on July 15th. The weather was unexpectedly hot.</p>
<p>Life was very difficult—couldn't speak Japanese well, especially couldn't understand it. I had studied it in extra classes in my home country, but unexpectedly, apart from a little grammar that I could grasp, the training of my mouth and ears was equal to nothing.</p>
<p>A few friends who had arrived in Japan before me were going to the beach, so I went with them.</p>
<p>Beach life is happy. There is a cool breeze in the morning; beautiful sunsets in the evening; and sometimes a bright moon. Although it is very hot during the day, with the ocean lying beside you, you can jump into its embrace and all the heat will disappear, leaving you feeling comfortable and content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often rains. At this time, you really feel bored. The sea is visible but inaccessible. The mountains stand with a sad and bleak look. Unable to bear the boredom, I had to play games with the landlord's children, play Go, flick beans, and learn a few children's songs from them.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also went to chat with a few Chinese friends on the beach.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on chatting. It can go from east to west, from south to north. It can also go from ancient to modern, from modern to ancient. If you want to say that "words are the voice of the heart," then this "word" often does not refer to a person's solemn speech, but is somewhat close to the boring nonsense during chatting.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we talked about the death of a female classmate.</p>
<p>A friend said: "The two sisters looked too different. The younger sister was so beautiful, the older sister was so ugly. If the younger sister had died, that would have been a pity. If the older sister had died, that wouldn't have been anything."</p>
<p>He was studying economics. He said this, and I didn't want to argue. Society has determined people's intentions. In a male-centered private property system, beauty is a condition for a woman's survival. This is almost the case in the hearts of most men.</p>
<p>But I remembered what he said two days ago:</p>
<p>"The female shop assistants in the company are simply like machines, unable to have any free will. In capitalist society, living people can be used as machines, and machines can also be used as living people."</p>
<p>At that time, I felt his words were very sharp.</p>
<p>If chatting really expresses a person, then isn't the exaggeration of theory like a radio? This is what is called:</p>
<p>Books can sometimes influence people, but the power of historical society will overflow from people, growing into a latent consciousness.</p>
<p>Now I have returned to Tokyo for more than a month. Today is Sunday, and it happens to be raining. Sitting alone at my desk, listening to the sound of rain, I suddenly remembered the words of my friend on the beach.</p>
<p>When will women be able to get rid of the conditions of beauty and ugliness and have their value determined by their ability to perform?</p>
<p>I hope the answer to this question can resonate in the hearts of all women who are oppressed by evil forces!</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Visiting the Garden</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Because it was a Sunday, I was browsing in the old bookstore at the City God Temple, and happened to find that the inner garden was open, so I went for a stroll. This place is not very big, but it took me an hour to walk around it. What's the reason?! It's because it was crowded.</p>
<p>Crowding is the best skill of Chinese people. The "ladies" who visited that day had developed this inherent culture quite a bit. But what made me stay for so long was not entirely this, but rather because the garden paths were winding, spiraling, and narrow. The toes of the people behind were touching the heels of the people in front, winding and turning. At times, I couldn't breathe—but I still had to squeeze.</p>
<p>This problem is said to be because it was originally a private garden.</p>
<p>But there are also several private gardens owned by foreigners in Shanghai, which are mostly bright and spacious, with flower branches in neat rows and whole pieces of grassland, where you can walk and run. However, these are Western-style, or rather, Europeanized. Ours, however, is really very refined, planting a few stalks of slender bamboo, planting a banana tree, or digging a lotus pond and building a rockery that almost occupies the entire garden. So it is winding, spiraling, and narrow. Is this to teach oneself or the children the ability to climb mountains in preparation for exploring the Himalayas? It's not. In fact, it is to keep a model of landscapes, to show one's yearning, to show some elegance, and to let the children imitate it, so that they can stroll leisurely, travel in mountains and rivers, and be an elegant scholar in the future.</p>
<p>We are really followers of the doctrine of propriety.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we drink tea, it is mostly bitter tea; when we write articles, we advocate the tranquility of autumn, but we are not very enthusiastic about the vigor of spring. But if we say that this is approaching old age and having a premonition of decline, it is not entirely true. These sighing and lamenting people are actually young people around thirty years old, who can't be said to be old or declining. Their predecessors left behind a winding, spiraling, and narrow environment. They walk leisurely, fiddle with their sleeves, and sway back and forth. They grew up in this inner garden-style society and are used to it.</p>
<p>But can we only get used to it forever?</p>
<p>The answer is: yes. If the inner mechanism does not change, it is not easy to change everything in the inner garden. The inner garden in the city has been renovated, but because it is necessary to maintain its original appearance, it is still winding, spiraling, and narrow, and you can't see any new atmosphere at all. To change this "habit," there must be sacrifices. Removing the rockery in front of you and filling in the lotus pond will create a fresh grassland that is bright, spacious, and where we can walk and run.</p>
<p>After visiting the inner garden, I wanted to write a record, but it is still just a few thoughts.</p>
<h3>Honorable Old Woman (6)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Maoxiu, translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>As the war continued to bring victories, the number of deaths and injuries only increased day by day. The initial cheers of joy had now taken on a tragic color. Government officials, military veterans, and elementary schools and other consolation personnel could not help but be active every day, busy with visiting bereaved families. And everything was covered up by the two words "honor." In reality, if you had not lived in that kind of atmosphere, you might not be able to imagine how much magic the two words "honor" had at that time. No matter how pitiful the bereaved family was, people used the two words "honor" to comfort them.</p>
<p>From this time on, the rice-cooking old woman inexplicably became gloomy and contemplative, and looked completely different from her previous state. When people were talking about the war, she seemed to try her best to avoid listening to it. Needless to say, she had come to realize that the deaths or injuries that had always seemed to have nothing to do with her were no longer other people's business. It was because her own son was also fighting in Lushunkou.</p>
<p>She became even more superstitious than before. She ran to all the temples and shrines in the city to worship, almost like a fanatic.</p>
<p>"Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha."</p>
<p>She constantly chanted the Buddha's name while doing chores. Moreover, people heard her muttering to herself in the kitchen, looking very focused, while washing rice or starting a fire:</p>
<p>"Buddha! God! I only have one son. Please protect his life! Please take my old life to replace my son's. Please, please help me, Buddha! God! You are a kind person, you know how much I cherish my son. Bless, bless, Buddha! God!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the tears flowing down her nose were shining like water droplets.</p>
<p>Sometimes, she would suddenly make a fuss. As soon as she met someone, she would grab them, no matter who they were, and splash with saliva, saying such things to you:</p>
<p>"Look, people are going to die sooner or later anyway. You and I are going to die too, and my son will have to die sometime sooner or later. Anyway, we all have to die, so it's better to die in the war. Because that's an honorable death. — That's what I think. Isn't it? Huh?"</p>
<p>In her shining, crazy eyes, it seemed that you could see the kind of infinite suffering that was being forcibly suppressed. No matter who saw her eyes, they would deeply sympathize with her. People gently accepted her words and slowly comforted her.</p>

<p>Special Medical Publication</p>
<h3>Initial Words</h3>
<p>— (Physician Luo Minxiu)</p>
<p>Today, this publication has the opportunity to meet with all readers for the first time. We should explain our guiding principles and wishes here in advance, as brief introductory remarks for the publication of this medical journal.</p>
<p>The situation in East Africa is critical, and unfortunately, war has broken out. Although some refer to it as a localized event, it may inevitably affect other regions. If our people continue to be drunkenly oblivious in the long, dark night, indulging in pleasure amidst extravagant entertainment, and recklessly abandon themselves, I fear that our beautiful land of China will face the calamity of ruin, and our outstanding nation will ultimately be scorned as the "sick man." Although there are certainly many who rise at the crowing of the rooster and remain vigilant in readiness for battle, a spirit of weakness has already become prevalent, and alas, they lack the strength of physique. To seek the path to strength, attention to hygiene and medicine is essential for success. Those with bad habits must resolutely quit them, and those with chronic illnesses must seek treatment. If the weak become healthy, and all Chinese people think in this way, it will be more than enough to reverse the trend of decline. Medicine has its methods, and treatment has its approaches. The principles of medicine and pharmaceuticals must be introduced to the general public so that they have a reasonable understanding. Otherwise, they will inevitably go in opposite directions. Therefore, the publication of this journal aims, firstly, to introduce the general situation of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals as a mirror for the nation, and secondly, to guide patients in seeking treatment, fulfilling the duties of a physician. This is the humble purpose of the editor.</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea (Vaginal Discharge)</h3>
<p>— (Female Physician Qu Wanfen)</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is a prevalent ailment most detested by women, yet there is no good way to prevent it from being associated with women. Protracted, untreated leukorrhea will inevitably hinder fertility, affect menstruation, and cause a sallow complexion, emaciation, and mental fatigue. Therefore, it should not be taken lightly. Female physician Wang Yuchu, at the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has conducted in-depth research and accumulated rich experience in treating this condition. To determine whether the condition contains gonorrhea bacteria, she uses a high-powered microscope for examination. Female patients are even entitled to free preferential treatment on a monthly basis. For those generally shy about seeking medical attention or who find treatment inconvenient, Dr. Wang also offers two types of medicine for sale: "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine," both of which are highly effective. Each type is priced at two yuan per box and is the only effective remedy for women to self-treat leukorrhea.</p>
<h3>On Pediatric Diseases</h3>
<p>— (Physician Sun Weirui)</p>
<p>Pediatric diseases, although referred to as the "silent specialty," are generally less complex and easier to treat compared to adult diseases. The underlying causes of illness are mostly related to intestinal and stomach ailments resulting from carelessness in diet, fever and convulsions from colds, restlessness in sleep, night crying, or parasitic diseases. Therefore, physicians who treat pediatric diseases, if they can focus on these major causes, should not stray too far from the right path in treatment. During my clinical practice, I often use "Ning'er Jindan" sold at the Jincheng Pharmacy at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Xinqiao Street, which I find quite effective because "Ning'er Jindan" has functions for the aforementioned diseases. Therefore, it is not unusual for the medicine to cure the illness. "Ning'er Jindan" is sold at one yuan per package, with an additional two jiao for postage to other locations. (Editor's note: Physician Sun Weirui is thorough in diagnosis, appropriate in treatment, and rich in experience in treating various pediatric diseases, making him one of the leading pediatric experts in Shanghai. His consultations are at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession. The "Ning'er Jindan" he recommends is the only effective medicine for reviving children from serious illnesses. Families with sick children should administer it to ensure peace and normalcy.)</p>
<h3>The Relationship between Scabies and Internal Diseases</h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Ma Yin)</p>
<p>Everyone knows that scabies is caused by microorganisms. Therefore, the only way to treat scabies is to kill the microorganisms. If the strength of the insecticide is insufficient, the surviving microorganisms will flee inward, leading to internal diseases with systemic symptoms. This is the flaw of all common scabies medications, where the old illness recurs and cannot be permanently eradicated, precisely for this reason. The inventor of "Ganlu Medicinal Water" understood this principle long ago and has therefore strived to avoid this drawback. Whether it is a new or old case of scabies or tinea, treatment with "Ganlu Medicinal Water" generally leads to a cure. The medicinal power is strong, and as long as the microorganisms come into contact with it, they are sure to be annihilated immediately, resulting in quick efficacy and no lingering problems. People say it is a sacred medicine for all skin diseases, which is entirely accurate. Each bottle sells for one yuan, available at Tongren Western Medicine Company, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai. For mail orders from other locations, please add two jiao for postage per item.</p>
<h3>Obligatory Guidance for Fellow Compatriots Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— (Physician Lu Zhijun)</p>
<p>Speaking of quitting smoking, it is actually extremely easy. As long as one has the determination and is determined, there is no reason why it cannot be quit. However, while many people become addicted to smoking due to social interactions, the majority are helplessly addicted due to a lack of energy and poor physical condition. Let alone not eating for a day or a few days, one will experience withdrawal symptoms as soon as the time passes. At that time, there will be indescribable pain that experienced comrades can easily imagine. Therefore, quitting smoking becomes a problem that requires consulting a doctor. Fortunately, there is now a smoking cessation expert, Physician She Zhen, who is skilled at understanding patients and eliminating all kinds of pain, always considering the patient's health, and is definitely not comparable to those clumsy doctors. On the one hand, he gradually reduces the opium component, and on the other hand, he uses appropriate supplements to assist the body's deficiencies, such as "Baolideng" (note: Baolideng is the only excellent product during the smoking cessation period, priced at two yuan per bottle, exclusively sold at Jincheng Pharmacy at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Xinqiao Street). Therefore, compatriots who have already quit smoking all praise him, and Dr. She has become the only smoking cessation expert. Dr. She usually resides at the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Comrades who are determined to quit smoking, please go there, which is the most appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Efficacy of Gonadoton</h3>
<p>— (Physician Gu Zhenqun)</p>
<p>"Gonadoton," a sacred medicine for treating gonorrhea sold at Tongren Western Medicine Company, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, has long been recognized by the medical and pharmaceutical community and is happily used and promoted. It can cure gonorrhea in its early stages with one dose, and even chronic gonorrhea, which is notoriously difficult to treat, can be eradicated with three or four boxes. The medicine can penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, directly reaching the affected area. Its effects in reducing inflammation, relieving pain, promoting urination, and eliminating gonorrhea are particularly significant, while having no impact on the body and not hindering fertility. Furthermore, it is highly effective for orchitis or buboes caused by gonorrhea. Each box sells for only two yuan. For mail orders from other locations, please add two jiao for postage.</p>
<h3>"Wanknong" and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— (Physician Chen Xingzhen)</p>
<p>People in all industries today are fiercely competitive and highly mentally stressed, so there are more people suffering from neurasthenia than ever before. What are the manifestations of neurasthenia? Symptoms include a sallow complexion, emaciation, poor appetite, mental fatigue, dreaminess and insomnia, spermatorrhea, and premature ejaculation, among others. If treatment is not sought quickly, the condition will gradually worsen, and neurological disorders and mental illnesses will result from such beginnings. As for the best treatment method, nothing is better than supplementing the body with nutrients to restore the fatigue from mental activities. The most important nutrient in the human body is, of course, protein. "Wanknong" is a protein preparation, combined with products to soothe the brain and calm the nerves. Therefore, it is most effective for treating neurasthenia. Each bottle sells for three yuan, exclusively sold at Jincheng Pharmacy at the corner of Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Adenopathy and Cough</h3>
<p>— (Physician Huang Sixian)</p>
<p>Those with a narrow chest, insufficient lung capacity, and enlarged thymus gland are said to have adenopathy. In individuals with adenopathy, the resistance of the respiratory system is weak, making them prone to catching colds. Colds lead to coughing, and coughing damages the lungs, creating an excellent opportunity for tuberculosis bacteria to invade. Therefore, adenopathy is an indication of susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis, or the constitution of pulmonary tuberculosis. There are many people with adenopathy in our country, so there are also many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. However, to strengthen the country and its people, we must do our best to eliminate pulmonary tuberculosis. It is especially necessary to correct adenopathy in individuals with the condition. For those with adenopathy who suffer from cough, thorough treatment is even more crucial. "Kelisu" certainly has the effect of moistening the lungs, resolving phlegm, relieving cough, and relieving asthma, making it quite appropriate to take. Furthermore, "Wanknong" has a very strong nutritional and tonic effect, nourishing the brain, benefiting the blood, strengthening the stomach, and promoting the production of body fluids, which are essential products for daily conditioning for the weak and infirm. (Editor's note: The two medicines "Wanknong" and "Kelisu" have reliable efficacy. "Wanknong" is three yuan per bottle, and "Kelisu" is two yuan per bottle, both sold at Jincheng Pharmacy at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Xinqiao Street, Shanghai).</p>
<h3>Illness Enters Through the Mouth</h3>
<p>— (Physician Chen Peiji)</p>
<p>Everyone eats. Food is the people's heaven. Eating is of great importance to human life. The mouth is the beginning of the entire digestive system, and the stomach is the general hub of the entire digestive system. Therefore, there are more stomach diseases than any other. The number of cases where stomach diseases affect the entire body is truly countless. As the ancients said, "Illness enters through the mouth." There is a reason for this. To prevent stomach illness, attention should be paid to food at the time of eating. One should not eat mixed foods, nor should one eat quickly. As a Western saying goes, "Chew carefully and swallow slowly," half of digestion is already achieved. Wonderful! If one is already ill, one should seek medical attention promptly. Seeking medical attention is not as good as selecting medicine. "Weibiling," sold at Tongren Western Medicine Company, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, specializes in treating all kinds of stomach diseases and is incredibly effective. Each box sells for only one yuan.</p>
<h3>Why Do Freckles Appear?</h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Long Fei)</p>
<p>Freckles are small, smooth, and non-protruding brown spots on the face. If they are sparse and light, there is no problem. If they are dense and dark, appearing in the most visible areas of the face, they are truly somewhat undesirable, especially hated by the most modern young women. Some people use an idiom, calling them "a flaw in white jade," which is the most accurate description. Regarding the causes of freckles, one is pigment deposition, and the other is poor blood circulation in the skin, making it difficult for waste products to be dispersed and absorbed. "Beauty Freckle Removal Facial Cream" can correct this problem and provide the skin's sensory nerves with appropriate excitement and pleasure. Therefore, everyone who has used it smiles with joy and praises it. This medicine sells for one yuan per bottle, available at Jincheng Pharmacy at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Xinqiao Street.</p>
<h3>Effective Medicine for Menstrual Disorders</h3>
<p>— (Female Physician Cheng Fang)</p>
<p>Menstruation is a physiological function of women, occurring naturally. If it encounters obstacles, pain will inevitably occur, leading to weakness in the limbs. In severe cases, there may be headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, poor appetite, and other symptoms. "Haolipeng," sold at Jincheng Pharmacy at the corner of Avenue Joffre and Xinqiao Street, is remarkably effective for various ailments during women's menstrual periods, such as difficult menstruation, excessive or insufficient flow, menstrual pain, limb weakness, tinnitus, blurred vision, and all unpleasant feelings. Therefore, it has formed an indissoluble bond with the women's community, being called an effective medicine for menstrual disorders. Each bottle sells for two yuan, with an additional two jiao for postage to other locations.</p>
<h3>Electrical Treatment</h3>
<p>— (Reporter)</p>
<p>Shanghai is an area rife with venereal diseases. Electrical treatment is the supreme and only effective method for treating venereal diseases. Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, is equipped with X-ray machines, artificial sun lamps, diathermy machines, Tias electric machines, shortwave diathermy machines, and everything else that is needed. It employs specialized physicians to oversee the diagnosis and treatment, so those seeking medical attention come in an endless stream. Furthermore, for the convenience of women, a female physician has been hired, and elegant rooms have been opened separately for treatment. As for the low fees, it is even more commendable.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>Massacre in East Africa</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The East African war has already broken out. Italy declared war without warning on the third day, sending its army and air force to launch a fierce offensive from the north, east, and south, carrying out a massive slaughter. The Italo-Ethiopian incident, which had been in stalemate for ten months, has now seen Italy hurl its first bomb at Ethiopia, stirring up the atmosphere worldwide. Mussolini's ambition is fully exposed here. After the two armies made contact, Ethiopia immediately filed a protest with the League of Nations, and Italy also notified the League of Nations of its actions. The Palace of Peace in Geneva will inevitably be destroyed again soon.</p>
<p>Although the Italo-Ethiopian conflict has only been underway for ten days, the fighting is extremely fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. It is reported that the Italian army in Madahar, led by Mussolini's two sons and one son-in-law, launched a heavy bombing raid on Aduwa on the third day. Approximately two thousand women, children, and soldiers were killed or injured, a very tragic scene. Ciano also destroyed the royal palace of Aduwa, making a great contribution. Mussolini should be proud to have such a brave son-in-law.</p>
<p>In this Italian military campaign, an Ethiopian Askari army of black soldiers has joined the fighting. These black soldiers are like walking powder kegs, carrying weapons such as machine guns, pistols, handguns, and broadswords. When they entered Ethiopian territory, they sang loudly in their local language, vowing to cut off the Ethiopian Emperor's beard and make it into a small brush to shine Mussolini's boots. Some people who see this may not be able to help but scold the Askari people for being shameless. I think it is unnecessary. These black people originally had no intention of killing their own kind. They were probably coerced for a time. When the Ethiopian Emperor's beard is indeed cut off and made into a small brush, they will realize that they are just slaves, only fit to shine Mussolini's boots, and it will be too late to regret.</p>
<p>Who will win the Italo-Ethiopian war in the future? This is difficult to predict. In terms of strength, Ethiopia is certainly no match for Italy. In terms of popular sentiment, the entire Ethiopian nation is united in hatred of the enemy and has made the determination to resist the enemy to the death, which cannot be taken lightly. However, the Italo-Ethiopian war is not limited to one corner of East Africa. Looking at Britain's recent actions, it seems intent on imposing sanctions on Italy. On the other hand, Italy has already stated that anyone who dares to impose sanctions will be met with war. It can be seen that it is possible for the Italo-Ethiopian conflict to trigger a war between Britain and Italy. Not only that, but a spark can start a prairie fire. It is possible that it will expand into a second world war. Today's Italo-Ethiopian war may be the prelude to the next world war.</p>
<h3>The Peddler</h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>—Impressions of an Ancient City—</p>
<p>What stands out in the ancient city is the peddler selling groceries. Usually, the peddler only sells some needles, threads, head ropes, wooden combs, buttons, and some small items for women. Sometimes he also sells photos of the Shanghai cityscape, but that is rare. The peddler carries a small rattle drum in his hand, carries a glass cabinet on his back, and walks around the streets and alleys, with the small rattle drum ringing everywhere. In the afternoon, the yellow sunlight pants on the roofs of the black houses. While the entire ancient city is lonely, the peddler's small rattle drum rings "de long long long long" in the hazy space for most of the day. There is no poetic rhythm, but it sounds light and comfortable. Standing in the building at this time, you can see the tattered hat moving in the air, moving, coming in from the hutong mouth, moving step by step, stopping at the door of the tailor shop next door. The small rattle drum is still ringing "de long long long long." Now you can see clearly that under the tattered hat, there is a smile formed out of habit, a flat, knowing face, and the eyes are thrown on the women on the road and the women who patronize him diligently.</p>
<p>At this time, the children who like to join in the fun often drag their parents to the peddler to ask for one or two Shanghai street scene photos. This item is very good for the peddler's business. A hundred photos can be sold out in four or five days, but the peddlers sell this item very rarely. Ask ten peddlers, and only two or three sell this photo, and no one can ask a definite reason.</p>
<p>When women lack small items such as needles and threads, they find the peddler selling groceries. They want this and that around the glass cabinet, like turning over the baskets in the field, just making a noisy sound. So the peddler takes out the items one by one from the glass cabinet, piling them up in a mess, always saying the same set of words: "Take your time, take your time! Everyone has it!" As he says this, he points to the items. The peddler is also a very capable small businessman. He knows who wants what and gives them what they want. In a few minutes, everything is done, and the customers pay and take the items. If they don't have change with them, they can also buy on credit and pay a few days later. Every peddler knows how to do business and is sensible. He greets and asks people he doesn't know.</p>
<p>The small tailor shop also asks the peddler for a few buttons and threads and other items each time, and the tailor shop has an account; the account is settled and paid off at the end of the year, and not a penny is missing, and the transaction is fair. This is probably due to the simplicity and honesty of the people of the ancient city.</p>
<p>When everything is done well and the transaction is settled, the peddler carries the glass cabinet on his back, shakes the small rattle drum, and leaves the hutong. In the distance, I can also hear the small drum sound, "de long long long long," just ringing lonely in the dust, in the ancient city.</p>
<p>Looking at the peddler's small rattle drum, I often think of the peddler in my hometown. The peddler in my hometown is also exactly the same as the peddler in this ancient city, only a few minor differences. The peddler in my hometown also carries a small rattle drum in his hand and carries a glass cabinet on his back, selling some needles, threads, head ropes, and small items for women. The difference is that he doesn't go to the city to sell them. The market in our city is prosperous, so the peddler only walks around the villages and towns, taking the small rattle drum and running on the village roads. If you prick up your ears, you can also vaguely hear the "de long long long long" drum sound ringing in the distance.</p>
<p>And the market in this ancient city is not as good as ours. Loneliness and desolation are the true colors of the ancient city. Therefore, the peddler can transport some things from other places and sell them in the city, but he does not go to the countryside. This is also a kind of deformed development in the ancient city.</p>
<h3>The Story of Cutting Off the Queue</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>The winding, towering mountain city firmly locks the thoughts of the people in Village A and Village B, who seem never to interact with each other, and cuts off the line of sight of those who are not allowed to look at the vast world. Mountains, water, green mountains, and green water are the materials we villagers discuss and the world we display.</p>
<p>When I was only five years old, I was studying in a private school. In the early morning, when we had not yet finished our morning class, the nearsighted, shoe-brush-bearded Mr. Li suddenly adopted a reserved tone, as if he understood the trends of the outside world, and said:</p>
<p>"Now the emperor... is gone, is... gone, um! It's over! It's over!... I heard that we have to cut off our queues, we have to cut off our queues! But, this is actually a... good thing! The queue is annoying!"</p>
<p>As he said this, he scratched at the root of his queue, and the fingernails, about four inches long, on his right hand picked at the black dirt under the fingernails of his left hand, and he took out a black grain and put it on the table. He smelled it with his nose and eyes for a while, pressed his thumb on the table, and a small spitting sound came out. Although the spitting sound was drowned out by the sound of reading, the older children all knew it was a louse. They did not dare to laugh out loud, and those closer to the teacher would put their books up to cover their laughing faces. Those who were more advanced would pretend to ask him to tell them what the book was about, and would tell him in passing. Those who were equal would cough and pull their mouths at the teacher. In less than a quarter of an hour, everyone in the class of more than ten people knew about it. I thought that "the young ones are mischievous," and I already knew about this matter. So I joined them in a burst of laughter, laughing so hard that my nose became a big bunch of drums. At this time, the teacher was pacing back and forth, as if proud of his knowledge of current affairs. As soon as he walked in front of me and heard my laughter, he rewarded me with a nail-like cane. My laughter had not yet stopped, and I immediately turned around and cried.</p>
<p>I cried sadly, as if I had suffered a great injustice.</p>
<p>The students snickered, and the sound was obviously not something that reading could cover up.</p>
<p>"Now!" The teacher walked to his seat and clapped the gavel.</p>
<p>He shook the queue behind him, which was as thin as a cigarette butt, "Cutting it off is a good thing, but without the emperor, without the emperor... it's over, it's over!"</p>
<p>After the morning class was dismissed, we walked out of the school gate. The school was located in an ancient temple on the highest mountain peak. Standing in front of the temple, we could look out over the mountains and into the distance, where the mist spread over the vast sea of smoke.</p>
<p>"That's where the rebellion is taking place; it's over there!"</p>
<p>Although children's hearts have the light of the future, their vision is small—and it is also locked in the mountains. Outside the mountains is like a foreign country, it is the place of rebellion.</p>
<p>When I returned home, I had a small bump on my forehead, as big as a hill. My mother asked me with concern, with a sympathetic eye and a loving attitude, which fueled my arrogance, and I cried and cried.</p>
<p>"What are you crying for!—You didn't study hard, so the teacher beat you?"</p>
<p>My father had just returned from the farm. He had never been very polite to me. As he said this, he glared at me. This glare frightened me so much that even my tearless cry brought out tears.</p>
<p>My mother represented the story once, and my father's attention was not on the problem of hitting me, but on the problem of cutting off the queue. He said:</p>
<p>"First cut off my queue, then I have to comb it, and it takes more oil. It's more convenient to cut it off!" To say something fashionable now, my father was like a "progressive figure," although his starting point was utilitarianism.</p>
<p>"You want to be a monk?—I don't want to be a monk's wife," my mother put me on her body, "and you don't want to be a monk's son," my mother used the means of threatening capitalists with a general strike to deal with my father.</p>
<p>"You'll be a nun, and he'll be a little monk." My father followed with a big laugh.</p>
<p>However, don't look down on that Mr. Li. He had quite a bit of magic. This news was probably spread to the homes by the students, and then spread out. The whole village was a sensation: the teacher was a person who "reads the books of sages," and what he said always had a basis.</p>
<p>Several rash young men, you secretly cut mine, and I will retaliate against you. Before long, there were more people with disheveled hair, but when they met, they would call each other "screech owl, exposing the ugliness of his grandmother's house." This was the attitude of the old women, and the young women would laugh and pray to heaven and earth when they saw someone cut off their queue.</p>
<p>Later, it turned into a trend. But the old people didn't cut off their queues so rashly. I remember the day my father "lowered his hair." He lit a lamp and burned incense in front of the ancestral tablet, and added four bows and eight prostrations. My mother also could not resist the impact of that trend, and she herself wielded the knife. With one snip, my father's queue and head separated. My father respectfully placed it on the incense burner. What for? I'm afraid he couldn't answer it either, while only a "chamber pot lid" remained on my head, so I avoided the disaster of a knife.</p>
<p>—It's the Republic of China now, and the Republic of China doesn't want queues anymore.</p>
<p>Later, this news finally got through to the mountain city, and our Mr. Li was only left with a bald tail.</p>
<p>It has been twenty-four years since the queue was cut!</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Today, Master Zhu's house is hosting a grand banquet, a miracle unseen in this town since time immemorial. Although Master Zhu is the wealthiest man in town, he only associates with people of high standing. But their comings and goings are always clandestine, as if they were committing a crime. He always uses the side gate, and those distinguished guests are also willing to enter and exit through the side gate. Except for the first and fifteenth of each month, when Master Zhu sits in his blue sedan chair to offer incense at the City God Temple, the two black lacquered doors are only briefly opened and closed when the chair enters and exits. This is because Master Zhu once held some official position. A gentleman does not forget his past, and the City God blessed him with so much wealth, so he cannot forget offering incense on the first and fifteenth of each month. Moreover, he must be respectful and reverent, entering and exiting through the main gate, so that this fortunate relic – the blue sedan chair – does not become a haven for silverfish.</p>
<p>Many of the farmers in the surrounding areas are Master Zhu's tenants. Every year, they have to go to the granary (Note 1) to pay rent. Some want to take this opportunity to inquire about the secrets within the two black lacquered doors, but Master Zhu himself uses the side gate, and the tenants can only enter and exit through the back door. Master Zhu's residence, known throughout the town as the "ten mansions with nine courtyards" (Note 2), has the accounting office located in the last mansion. What the tenants see is the back gate of a garden, secured with a foot-long iron lock. There is also a row of five large granaries, with piles of rice stalks as high as the roof ridge; and, of course, the account's face as stern as the City God. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Bundle of Radio Waves</h3>
<p>Generals Tong Lei and Ruan Jiao, your pens are "indeed" good, your art of scolding people is "not bad" either, but I think you two are "eating your own food and meddling in other people's business", which is probably not worth it, right? In my opinion, you two don't need to shout like Zhang Fei: "Who dares to fight me a hundred rounds," and you don't need to say vulgarities like "illegitimate child". Everyone is "looking for hairs in an egg, seeking silk on ivory chopsticks". In the end, the hatred will only deepen. If you attack me and I attack you, won't there be one more enemy in the broadcasting world in the future? As the saying goes, "When two tigers fight, one must be injured." If one is injured, will the other gain a few pieces of meat? Good! Let me think of a "diplomatic solution"! It is said, "No fight, no friendship." The ancients have proven this to us. Although you two are not really fighting, it is almost the same. Well, I won't talk anymore. I trust that the two generals will understand. Otherwise, I will have to ask the two generals to follow Zeng Shen of Bei and "think thrice before acting"! (Ugly Woman)</p>
<p>The battle of words between the two esteemed brothers, Ruan Jiao and Tong Lei, is truly fought with real swords and spears, and has gone on for several rounds. In fact, you two are too competitive. Brother Tong Lei is too full to do anything, and insists on looking for trouble. Brother Ruan Jiao also refuses to admit his mistakes. So you fire a gun, he swings a knife, and the great battle begins. It is said that Brother Ruan Jiao is a poor young scholar who makes a living by writing articles for稿費. He is still editing publications now, so I think he would certainly be willing to give in. I also heard that Brother Tong Lei is the young owner of ×× Cafe at No. 48, Penglai Market. Fortunately, he has food and shelter, so he can afford to meddle in other people's business. Brother Jiao, Brother Lei, do you agree? (Iron Pen)</p>
<p>Since there is a peacemaker coming forward in the battle between Tong Lei and Ruan Jiao, I think both sides should rest. The facts will eventually prove it to you. (Editor)</p>
<p>Dear Editor: After reading Mr. Ji Hongshou's letter in the Radio column of your esteemed newspaper on the 12th, regarding the Mei華 Music Association, I am extremely surprised. Our association was established in the spring of 1931 and has a history of three years. At that time, we broadcast on radio stations such as Da Zhonghua, Yuanchang, Foyin, Zhongxi, Anding, and Huadong, with evidence from the directors of each radio station. Moreover, our association members are currently broadcasting in various broadcasting organizations in Shanghai. Those who hold the position of president include the presidents of Man Society, Egret Society, Lao Yanyan Society, Jue Shi Harmonica Society, Hao Hao Society, and Rose Society, all of whom are members of our association. From this, it can be seen that our association has a long history, strong strength, and abundant talent. There is no need to boast, as the facts speak for themselves. The Meihua Music Association led by Mr. Li has only recently emerged and suddenly wants to usurp our association's name. Who is right and wrong, who came first and who came later, the facts will prove. It cannot be distinguished by empty words. Therefore, please ask Mr. Li to inquire at major radio stations and organizations in Shanghai, and he will know the history and reality of our association. Also, please change the word "Meihua" of the association as soon as possible to clarify the situation and avoid misunderstanding by various sectors. Enclosed is a news item about our association from the Radio Weekly of April 13, 1934. (Omitted) Old-Brand Meihua Music Association Leaders Ma Tinglong and Liu Mohong, respectfully, October 12th.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Ruhui of the Midnight Music Society was recently invited by Star Film Company to compose more than ten songs and teach the company's actresses to sing, preparing them to attend the art show for athletes from all over the country. The date has been set for the 14th night. The program includes (1) National Music Ensemble "Brocade River" (2) Gu Jun "Descending Qiong Lou" (3) Gu Mei Jun "Sewing Poor Woman" (4) Yuan Shaomei "Boat Girl Song" (5) Shu Xiuwen "Wild Geese are Too Pitiful" (6) Huang Naishuang "Cotton Yarn" (7) Zhu Qiuhen "Could it Be Wild Flowers Are Fragrant?" (8) Ye Qiuxin "Youth Misspent" (9) Yan Yuexian "Flower of Spring" (10) Xu Lai "Westernized Youth" "Seeking Female Clothes" (11) Gu Lanjun and Gu Mei Jun duet "Curved Moon" (12) Hu Die "Friend in Sickness" Break "Balustrade" (13) All Star Ensemble "Brother Line". The songs "Youth Misspent", "Breaking Jade Balustrade", "Flower of Spring" and "Brother Line" are all movie songs being filmed by the company. At that time, Xu Ruhui will lead all the members of the Midnight Music Society to provide ancient music accompaniment. The Chinese symphony "Aspiring Ambition" composed by the society will also be performed at the same time. It is said that the song is extremely majestic and stirring.</p>

<h3>Introduction to "Jade Horse"</h3>
<p>"Jade Horse" is Xu Xinfu's great work after "Street Willow Wall Flower." Viewers probably haven't forgotten the touching aspects of "Street Willow Wall Flower". The personalities of each of its leading actors are portrayed so vividly that even every small movement is extremely typical. In "Jade Horse," directed by Xu Jun this time, he further demonstrates his inherent strengths. Wang Zhengxin in "Jade Horse" plays a resolute and unyielding detective. When Zhao Dan, the president of the Anti-Drug Association, is assassinated, he runs around all night, trying to solve the case. In the apartment of the socialite Yan Yuexian, he unintentionally discovers something related to the Zhao Dan case. He uses this to track down the residence of Gong Jianong, who sells poison pills. Sure enough, at Gong Jianong's residence, he finds a zinc plate with a poisonous substance trademark. This further confirms his involvement in the murder of Zhao Dan. He then tries every means to solve the case. As a result, Gong Jianong finally admits that he is a drug dealer and is captured by him.</p>
<p>The socialite Yan Yuexian loves Zhao Dan, but Zhao Dan does not love her. Gong Jianong, on the other hand, is the most ardent pursuer of her. Later, when Gong Jianong and Wang Zhengxin have a conflict at her home, she is killed by stray bullets. Gong Jianong is a villain who sells poison pills, leading many of his henchmen to transport large quantities of poison pills from this city to another city. His methods are extremely ruthless. When he learns that Zhao Dan is working hard to promote the anti-drug movement, he resolutely beats him to death. Later, when he knows that Wang Zhengxin has discovered his secret, he goes to assassinate Wang Zhengxin. After much torment, he is finally arrested. Next to be mentioned is Gu Lanjun. She is an innocent woman. Because of her youth, she only knows how to seek pleasure every day. Like other young ladies of the bourgeoisie, she goes in and out of dance halls and bars every day. She is a good friend of the villain Gong Jianong, but she doesn't know his secrets at all. … The characters in "Jade Horse" are all vivid and have very distinct personalities, such as Wang Zhengxin's resourcefulness, Yan Yuexian's romanticism, Gong Jianong's ruthlessness, and Gu Lanjun's innocence and dissipation. They can all be seen in their every move.</p>
<p>"Jade Horse," the first Chinese sound detective film, is indeed novel and exciting. It is expected that it will cause a sensation when it is released.</p>
