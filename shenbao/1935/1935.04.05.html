<h3>推行注意漢字問題</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>最近教育部為推行義務教育及增進民眾識字之效率已採納國語統一籌備委員會之意見將切實推行注音符號規定小學課本及兒童民衆讀物一律用注音漢字印刷此舉實為我國維新以來教育行政方面值得注意之一種重要設施在文化史上應大書特書之盛事也</p>
<p>我國文字在使用上不及西洋文字之便利凡稍有常識者類能言之而改進漢字之運動亦已有三四十年之歷史其改進之工具所謂「注音字母」或「注音符號」者亦已一再由政府明令提倡無如實際上一向因仍舊貫未見明效推厥原由或由於主其事者未能詳定步驟有力者未能切實推行之故　今也國語統一籌備會體察前此未著明效之所以力闢關於阻礙推行之反對理由主張漢字注音銅模由國家鑄造推行請當局先就行政權能直接所及者着手教育部已准如所請並提出行政院會議通過支欵二萬元委託中華書局代鑄銅模聞將明令限自某年某月起編印小學課本及兒童民衆讀物一律用注音漢字印刷原有未注音者酌定期限逐漸廢止循此辦法改進漢字運動當可漸入佳境矣</p>
<p>然自消息傳布以來反對此議者似亦不少其所持理由無非謂漢字於注音符號並列形式上旣嫌累贅實際教學亦有所不便然竊以為就一般文字發達之順序言由意符文字渡到音符文字之後當脫離音符之束縛而造成一種有規律之拚音文字我國文字之變遷當進至音符文字階段時因受社會環境之影響竟走入歧途以致未能再進一步成為拼音文字今之注音符號乃使我國文字由此歧途授出使回歸一般文字進化軌道之階梯耳旣日注音符號其用途首在注音則興漢字並列固所宜也形式上之累贅誠所難免但兩害相形取其輕兩利相權取其重注音漢字若果大有裨益於民衆識字效能之增進則形式上之累贅自只得在所不計矣至於教學不便云云在推行之始凡識字而未習注音符號者自感不便無可否認第一旦環境造成習慣養成則在教者學者或均無所謂便與不便也觀夫中西合璧之文書通行於通商大埠漢英對照之刋物方為學習英文或漢文之利器可知注音符號與漢字並列在初學者不獨未必不便或反能增進其自修之效能是故注音漢字誠能切實推行經過相當時期此等反對論調不難漸歸息滅也</p>
<p>關於推行之法按國語統一籌備會之原議注音銅模應由國家鑄造推行今教育部决撥欵委託書局代辦此或由於經費支絀不得不借助於商業機關之故其實改進文字以增進一般人民識字之效能在政治上之意義殊不下於航空及公路之建設政府果欲積極推行注音符號以貫澈改革文字之鵠的當寬籌經費以赴之始克有濟總之教育部能毅然採納國語統一籌備會之意見良足稱道惟於寬籌經費一層竊願政府諸公亦加以相當之注意耳</p>

<h3>英上院辦論遠東事件　打消調解建議　英外次詳述不贊同理由　謂調停把召爭執國疑慮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外部次官史丹賀浦勳爵、今日在上院辯論遠東事件時、打消英國應為中日間調人之建議、此項辯論、係一九三一年曾任掌壐大臣　爾勳爵所發動、譬爾動議、請政府注意於日本脫離國聯、及中國喪失國聯行政院理事席後遠束所有之新局勢、謂此種事件、已挫弱東方與歐洲之維縏、渠不贊成仇視日本之見解、渠以為　者對日而發之詆斥言論、已釀成不少危害、英國在遠東有長久而親密之關係、在權利上卽在義務上應密切研究此時局、而以熟悉其形勢的友人之資格、向中日雙方、</p>
<p>進其忠告</p>
<p>日外相廣田所發之言論、殊可增中國內外所抱日本欲統治中國之惶慮、今此時局充滿疑忌、不獨不减、且漸濃厚、日本目的何在、此為問題、日本顯欲在西方列强關於中國之任何計盡中、有聽其一言以定行止之優勢、至於日本膨脹之需要及其多得市塲與原料之願望、固吾人所不能不承認者也、以言可能的補救方法、其最明顯者、為召集九國公約簽字國之會議、但此舉將開罪日本、徒使時局愈臻惡劣、英國於此、應以極女好形式、供獻調解人之役務、但附以諒解、卽英國欲知其內幕進行如何、而以成立和平與信任之唯一意旨、襄助其事是也、此為英國可供獻其役務之良好年頭、以今年可稱</p>
<p>為中國年</p>
<p>也、中國劇彩樓配巳在英國成功、而伯林頓大厦之中國畫藝展覽會、與中國學生四百人之來游英倫、應携回英國友誼之一種印象、吾人宜設法調和中日而不引起他國之猜疑與敵意云、保守黨紐頓動爵近曾游歷遠東、主張考慮日本立塲、謂中日刻在談判中、以渠個人所知、此項談判當可有圓滿結局、因日本準備以關於稅關之某種辦法付巨欵與中國也、日本併吞中國之慮、未免神經錯亂、日本在財政上或他點上、未能有此舉動、英國宜竭其所能、以便利中日間之協定、而不涉及國聯、倘對日本作十字軍行動、則勢必釀成白人與亞洲二人國間之戰爭、結果使白人在東方所有者、靡有子遺耳云、保守黨阿索爾勳爵繼紐頓而發言、謂最好辦法、為聽令日本佔領滿洲耳、日本為滿洲已付金錢與赤血之不少代價、而中國亦可因此獲有自相團結之機會云、格拉斯戈伯爵言中國與緬甸間劃界委員會事、問何時可進行其工作、保守黨拉明頓動爵謂、英美日三國此時宜成立關於太平洋之協定云、巴恩璧勳爵（卽去年赴日「滿」之英國實業考察團領袖）謂、日本擴張其侵略行為之說、實屬不確、財政宜首先者慮、觀於日本之許多拘束、如謂日本意在併吞中國一大部份、殊不近情、中國須了解對英依賴與</p>
<p>對日合作</p>
<p>之必要、如中日合作、則英國亦可望合作、且將睛美國加入合作、除舊金山方面之狂躁政治家外、無人以為美日間有根本爭點之存在、凡稍有理想者、皆知日未必不變其現有地位、中國輿情現漸轉變、而趨向對日之較好諒解云、保守黨艾汀頓動爵（前曾充中國敵產保管員）繼起發言、謂中日利益未必衝突、但雙方决裂之事實、造成危險時局、他國應設法調停之、英國最適宜為調解人、應决計為之、現有重大問題、應立卽注意者、中國現有經濟崩潰之危險、如不及早挽救之、恐大禍發生、莫可挽回、英國屆時將遇有亞洲門羅主義之已成事實云、洛襄勳爵亦表示意見、謂遠東問題可以忍耐與智慧態度解决之、禍根在日本採取片面行動、而不商諸華盛頓條約之簽字國、吾人必須恢復華盛頓條約之原則、有關係的列强之公開討論、乃唯一解决辦法云、馬萊勳爵（前陸軍部次官一九三二年曾以反戰大會之發起人資格來游上海）聲稱、採取純粹</p>
<p>仇日態度</p>
<p>乃背離實際之舉動、非至日本開始其大陸政策後、他國不準備應付將其所有特殊利益交與日本之問題、他國方面之犧牲、實屬必要、日本現另有一種發展、現有造成蒙古帝國之可能性、此點宜加以慎重之注視、吾人苟不予以同情之觀察、而判斷吾人如何可助其發展之程度、則吾人絕不能獲美滿之解决、工黨願贊助有關係國間連蘇俄在內之完全討論、此種會議必須切實聲明有關係國絕無容許中國人民被他人繼續宰割之意云、外部次官史丹賀浦勳爵代政府作答、謂中國金融行將崩潰之說、與事實相去太遠、中國近曾探問英國可否以借欵助之、英政府曾同情而慎重的考慮其議、但决定此種計畫僅有暫時效果、不能眞正有益於中國、英國曾商諸與遠東極有關係之他國、而告以英國之行動、俟研究一般局勢之中國委員會呈送其報告書後、英國及他國將予以極同情之考慮、觀於日本之財政現况、渠以為日本未必準備以巨欵貸與中國、而換取各種特殊利益、至於英國應為調人之說、渠不贊同調停、蓋調停者、常作干涉爭執之解、而雙方爭執國且常聯絡以與調停人為敵也、此非英國所願採之地位、召集會義之說、目前是否有益、亦屬可疑、</p>
<p>正當政策</p>
<p>在繼續吾人現所為者、而不必大張旗鼓、吾人願促成與遠東有一關勤前屬係國之接近、日俄間之接近、固吾人所歡迎也、關於中日雙方之談話、吾人已明白向雙方表示、如能有所補助以抒解其困難、或疏通其情意、吾人願欣然為之、中日當局皆知吾人現抱有中日和解實有益於雙方、且亦有益於全世界之見解、至於緬甸劃界事、渠知數日內將互換公文以成立劃界委員會云、辯論至此終結、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>日外務省態度　不容第三國干涉</h3>
<p>（南京）據外電傳英國上院三日下午討論中國問題甚詳、日外務省對於此消息表示如次意見、英國上院議員中有議論英國政府介在中日兩國之間調停兩國關係、其意如何、殊難諒解、蓋中日關係决不容英國政府之干涉也、英政府干涉中日關係、反使中國內訌激化、毫無益處、吾人深望英政府對於此項問題、抱公正妥當見解、（四日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>法商業部長　啟程赴此京</h3>
<p>（巴黎）商業部長馬尚陶、將於明日啟程赴比京自魯塞爾、綠自比國貨幣貶價後、法國工商業因之而感受影響、故前往比京與該國總理齊蘭舉行談話、俾在極友好融洽之空氣中、將法國政府為保護國內工商業、而不得不採取之步驟、加以研究云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英內閣討論歐局　外交政策主要傾向　對東歐公約不採取任何約束　在三四會議中繼續調解任務</h3>
<p>（倫敦）內閣於本日舉行例會、根據英國閣員自柏林、莫期科、華沙所獲得之消息、討論目前外交局勢、據消息靈通方面推測、英國外交政策之主要傾向、大旨如下、（一）關於東歐互助公約、英國對於東歐方面、不採取任何約束、東歐各國之安全、應由有關係各國自行解决之、如由有關係各國訂結束歐公約、包含規定「侵略國定義」之條欵、自無不可、但此種「侵略國定義」條欵、英國亦不便參加、惟英國對於各項集體安全組織之企圖、仍當繼續加以精神的擁護、（二）英國在斯穗萊柴會議中、當繼續在穗國與其他列强間、担任調解、以使歐洲局勢歸於緩和、英國在斯德萊柴會議中、旣以調人自居、則可造成局勢、以間接迫令德國參加集體安全組織、由列强談判各項協定、而不顧及穗國、且不與德國互換消息、則非英國所能贊成、英國認為斷不可使德國發生一種感想、以為德國已被抨於歐洲協調之外、蓋必使德國深信列强無排斥穗國之意、則以後方可隨時利用談判之機會、以使德國參加他國之一切和平企圖、職是之故、日前意大利人民報主張斯穗萊柴會議、應决定共同行動綱領、以應付未來之某種事變、對於此種主張、英國實未便贊成、（三）英國外交界方面、希望英法意三國共同商定一種宣言、提出四月十五日國聯會行政院非常會議、俾行政院不必加以討論、即可接受此項宣言、此項宣言、應重申列強對於德國宣佈廢止凡爾賽條約軍事條欵一事所採取之態度、但同時應使門戶仍行開闢、俾可繼續與德國進行談判、此外在該宣言內或可列入一項、規定遇有作集體行動以維持和平之必要時、各國應互相諮詢、以上為英國外交政策之一般傾向、但此種傾向、决非一成不變至目前為止、尚屬試探性質、能否成功、則當視有關各國之態度若何以定之也、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英內閣將於星期五集會、以聽取掌爾大臣艾登訪問莫斯科、華沙及柏萊格之報告、下星期首外相西門與艾氏將赴斯特萊薩、惟首相麥唐納或將不參加三國會議、政界不希望斯特萊薩會議產生重要結果、惟重視四月十五日召集之國聯行政會議、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>墨索里尼提出計劃</p>
<p>（倫敦）據每日電聞報載稱、意相墨索里尼將在斯德萊柴會議中、提出一種計劃、蓋墨索里尼以為在企圖訂結各項互助公約以前、必須先行創造一種最堅固之情感、以使各國相互信任、因此墨索里尼或將提出一種宣言、由歐洲各國共同簽字、宣言內並附帶建議、重開經濟政治談判、以改良各國相互之關係、此項計劃、將以去年意奧匈三國恊定為藍本、規定凡遇有關歐洲大局之各項問題、各國應相互諮詢、如遇有一簽字國要求時、並可召集各該國舉行會議、査意奧匈三國恊定之目的、本在規定一種共同政策、、以改善多瑙河諸國之政治經濟關係、今墨索里尼之計劃、則欲將此種協定、播充範圍、以推行全歐各國云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾外長現定本月十日晚間、啟程前往意大利期德萊柴城、參加英法意三國會議、外部重要職員多人、如秘書長雷瑞等、將與賴氏同行、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法方擬議修改公約</p>
<p>（巴黎）據可靠消息、法國官塲今日計劃修改擬議中之東歐公約、俾使波蘭可以參加、法國計劃修改之起源、係因波蘭拒絕參加現有方式之公約、一般人希望修改之後、德國或者亦能贊成、同時法國已進行大舉建造飛機之計劃、參院已通過擴充空軍、至一九三五年底、法國空軍實力之大、將非德國於短時期內所能追隨、外交方面則法國仍擬與蘇俄等國、締結軍事防守協約、據稱、捷克或者亦能參加、惟須俟意相墨索里尼所召集之三國會議、能否議定範圍較廣之安全公約為斷、大槪法國對於該項公約、將有確切之建議、以應付波蘭軍部部長畢爾蘇資基上將之反對、共建議內容、大槪將使東歐國家與國聯發生更直接之關係、而不專事締結純粹軍事上之聯盟、至於意國會議是否將邀請東歐各國共同參加、則外交界尚在討論中云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>法報觀察認為失敗</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報評論英波兩國華沙談話、大都以為結果並無何種新發展、惟若干報紙則仍希望波蘭翻然改圖、小巴黎人報謂、法外長賴伐爾聘問波蘭之消息、華沙聞之大為滿意、此則極宜加以注意、又謂「波蘭外長柏克上校、與軍政部長畢爾卡蘇資基、與英國掌爾大臣艾登談話時、對於東歐公約、並未明白加以拒絕云、」小日報則載衆院外交委員會副主席特穗桑一文日、「外長賴伐爾華沙之行、或可使波蘭不再抱模稜兩可之態度、此則於波蘭自身以及歐洲和平之前途、均有裨益者也、」此外小日報又載稱、艾登莫斯科之行、克告成功、而華沙之行、則歸於失敗、柏克上校原可於親法或親德之兩集團間、任擇其一、所惜渠業已有選擇、彼所選擇、未必與法波同盟並行不悖也、」（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>艾登與　捷克外長會談　保障和平政策一致</h3>
<p>（倫敦）艾登今晨八時、可抵捷克首都柏拉格、與捷克外長皮尼士博士會談、據預定之程序、艾登會談畢、與博士午餐後、卽擬乘飛機遄返倫敦、同時據消息靈通各界之意見、艾登之聘問華沙、確已獲有效果、雖波蘭對於東歐公約聲明其不能允諾之困難、然此行不能謂為全無裨益也、與艾登同行之專家、似皆確切主張英國對維持歐洲和平之舉、應負一部份之貴任、艾登騁問諸國之報告書、內閣將於星期五日開會考慮之、今日得悉英代表之參加斯特里薩會議者、已內定外相西門及艾登二人、下星期初卽將首途、首相麥唐納似不致出席也、據外交次官史丹賀浦勳爵、昨夜在上院宣稱、政府仍信限制或縮减軍備公約有可成之望、惟承認此種公約、範圍必狹、大約僅將限制某種砲的口徑、及某種坦克車之噸位云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>捷克京城英國掌璽大臣艾登、曁隨從人員於今晨行抵此間、當卽與捷克外長貝奈斯舉行談話、第一次談話後發表公報、謂兩國政府對於保障一般和平之目的及政策、完全一致、兩國政府表示信守國聯會之政策、始終不變云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奧內閣發表公報　效法德國重整軍備　謂必要準備已着手進行　為法國包圍計劃之一部</h3>
<p>維也納政府今日發表公報、宣稱奧國已準備效法德國、廢棄凡爾賽和約之軍備限制、並以簡潔之語氣、謂『必要之準備、業已着手進行』云、據稱、奧國目前為歐洲唯一國家尚無軍事組織、而其四隣皆已盡力擴充軍備、觀察者謂外交方面已向法國通知、並已徵求法國之同意、總理許土尼格之政府、與法國頗為友好、且竭力把對與德聯合、故其重整軍備之計劃、恐亦將循此基礎實行、據悉奧國之計劃、亦為法國包圍德國之一部、於可能範圍中、或將參加擬議中之防守互助公約、茲奧國陸軍之後備軍長官、已奉令報到、大槪其目的卽為動員新軍也、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>維也納昨夜內閣開會後、發表文告、謂奧政府决請列强允准重施强迫軍役制、按聖哲曼和約中曾禁化此舉、奧國領袖顯欲避免以片面行動否認該約而引起非難與可能的後果、彼等或恐小協約國與巴爾幹協約國所發如其他前敵國步穗國之後麃、而施行强迫軍役制、則諸國擬卽動員以事對付之恫嚇、將見諸事實也、公報日、本日內閣會議、由總理許希尼格博士主席、討諭奧國陸軍擴張問題、閣員意見一致、皆以為准許奧國有充分之平等、實為自明的假定、故今將取必要的籌備步驟云、此次會議、副總理卽內衛軍領袖史泰漢堡並未出席、殊堪注意、據消息　通之政界中人聲稱、奧政府現擬就輔助軍中用挑選徵兵法增加陸軍六萬人、按照聖哲門和約之規定、普遍强迫制、應加廢止、奧國陸軍連軍官與聯隊本部之兵在內、以三萬人為限、奧政府現圖請列强修正該約、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納據有力方面之觀察、奧國發表廢棄凡爾賽條約軍備條項、必已與法國成立或種種外交的諒解、以宿尼奚為主班之奧政府親法彩色非常濃厚、而與國社黨德國之聯携、最為法國所忌、故以上述事情為基礎、奧國之軍備復活、遂致實現、（四日電通電）</p>
<h3>捷克未表驚異</h3>
<p>捷克京城奧國政府宣布軍備權平等之一事、捷克朝野聞之、並未表驚異、蓋小協商三國外長、前在南斯拉夫京城、及捷克勃拉的斯拉伐會議時、固已考慮及之矣、小協商方面意見、以為軍備平等權、應由國聯會行政院加以審議、惟由單方面行動、採行何種立塲、則為小協商國所堅决反對云、（四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>德國空軍實力　英與論表示驚異</h3>
<p>（倫敦）穗國空軍軍力已與英國並駕齊驅、此層曾由德國希特勒總理面告英國閣員、昨日西門外相在下議院中已加以承認、英國輿論聞之、至為驚異、每日　報評論謂、『德國按照預定之工作時間表逐步進行工作、凡以設置空軍非難穗國者、德國輒置之不理、迨空軍業已準備就緒、始公開宣布、而告凡爾賽和約之維護者曰、「德國空軍現已成立、君等其將如之何乎、」』每日電聞報則謂、「秘密隱瞞之時期、現巳過去、希特勒旣已承認德國空軍與英國相等、則吾人殊有理由可以假定該國空軍力量、實不僅與英國對等而已、蓋以德國空軍發展之迅速、則其超過英國自無可置疑也」云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據巴黎廻聲報今日消息、英外相西門所寫之秘密備忘錄、綜述其與德元首希特勒新近之談話者、現為法外部所有、此文已造成法內閣極深切之印象、此文與星期二日法總理佛蘭亭所發之言論有關、當日法總理曾稱、法政府現正攷慮增多現役兵士之額數云（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英波商約成立　波蘭國外貿易增進</h3>

<p>最近期內洽商辦法</p>

<h3>中國兒童敎育問題</h3>
<p>— 王世杰</p>
<p>昨日兒童節在中央廣播電台廣播</p>
<p>今天是兒童節、我們全國的父老只弟姊妹、應該一而為全國的兒童祝福、一面為全國的兒童請命、</p>
<p>我們知道、所謂「人的權利」、（簡單的說、就是所謂「人權」）、到了十八世紀末年、法美革命的時候、已經得到了法美兩國法律的承認、因爲他們把所謂「人權宣言」或所謂「權利宜言」納入了他們的革命憲法、到了十九世紀末年、許多其他的國家、在他們的憲法或其他法典中、也都接受了法美革命時代的理諭、可是十八九世紀中、文明人類的努力、在大體上仍只注重到成人的權利、和成人的福利、兒童·在家庭·在社會·應享的權利、就是在文明諸國、當時也還不曾得到相當的注意、</p>
<p>可是十八世紀倡導人權學說最力的法國大思家盧梭、並不是專爲成人說話的、盧梭在他的約論中、旣已主張一切人類的權利、在他的名著愛美爾（Emite）中、則更特別主張兒童利、他不單是一個政治思想家、他并且是一個教育學家、他的基本見解是、第一、人的一生的生活、大半在兒童時期就决定了、人的一生的幸福、大半在兒童時期就造就了、或毀滅掉了、第二、兒童的　　、應該科學化、他的民約論、人們稱之爲「人權宣言」的底稿、他的愛美爾一書、人們也稱之爲「兒童權利宣言」、</p>
<p>晚近以來、盧　這種學說、漸漸得到大衆的認識、兒童問題的重要、漸漸得到了普遍的承認、我們常常聽到人說、「二十世紀應該是一個兒童世紀」、現在二十世紀已經過去了三分之一、我們可以看看現代進步的國家、對於兒童福利問題的努力、究竟有些什麼成績、做我們仿行或參考的資料、</p>
<p>兒童敎育</p>
<p>在一般現代國家、兒童的義務教育年期大概是從六歲或七歲到十四歲、有些國家近來並已經把義務教育的年齡、擴充到中學年齡、卽十六歲（例如英國）甚或十八歲（例如法國及美國諸邦）、這是十八九世紀人士所夢想不及的一種進步、此其一、</p>
<p>兒童健康</p>
<p>爲保障兒童的健康起見、近年以來—尤其近一二十年來—許多國家成立了許多新的制度採用了許多新的方法、如孕婦和產婦的特別保護天花白喉等症的强制預防、牛乳以及其他兒童食物的統制、學校衛生檢査的嚴密、兒童衛生知識的宣傳、等等皆是、其結果爲各國嬰兒死亡率之銳减、即如就英國言、在短短的最近三四十年中嬰兒死亡率便已减少了一半（一八八三年、每一千兒童的死亡率爲一四六一九二七年爲七〇）、此其二、</p>
<p>孤苦兒童的救濟</p>
<p>在許多國家、孤苦的兒童、從前差不多全靠私人慈善團體救濟、現在則漸漸改由國家救濟、歐戰後的德國就是最明顯的例子、私生子在法律上的地位近來亦大見改善、甚或與婚生兒女完全平等、俄國就是明顯的例子、這在傳統的法律觀念上、也是一種革命、此其三、</p>
<p>童工保護</p>
<p>在歌洲產業革命的初期、兒童是最大的犧牲者、譬如十九世紀初期、英國紡織工廠的童工、和我國現時絲廠紗廠的童工、其境遇之苦、倘非親歷、人們簡直不能想像、現在則一般國家、均已禁止十四歲以下兒童入工廠工作、國際勞工會議並已將此項限制、訂入國際協約、即十四歲以上至二十一歲左右之幼年、在列國勞工法上近亦受有種種保障、此其四、</p>
<p>兒童的犯罪</p>
<p>一般進步的國家、對於兒童的犯罪、近年大都採用了以下兩種政策、一爲形事責任年齡提高、從前的法律、極幼的兒童都可看作罪犯、都要負刑事责任、譬如羅馬法便認七歲以上的兒童、卽得成爲罪犯、現在許多國家的刑法、對於十七八歲的犯罪兒童、尚認爲只可負有限的刑事責任、二爲兒童法庭的設立、現在許多國家、對於犯罪兒童的糾正、只用感化而不用懲罰、只付諸特別兒童法庭審理、不付諸普通法庭審理、此其五、</p>
<p>以上所舉、還不過是犖犖大者、然即此數端、已可略見現代一般國家對於兒童問題努力的成績今天我們爲全國兒童請命、以上種種問題自然都應該注意到、不過兄弟的職分是在教育方面、因此、便只想對中國兒童的教育問題、多說幾句話、</p>
<p>兄弟曾經在這僩廣播電台講述過、在中華民國過去的二十餘年中、就學生數額而言、我們的高等教育擴充了一百倍、中等教育擴充了八倍、小學教育却只擴充了四倍、民國元年小學學生數爲二百七十餘萬、民國二十年也還只一千一百餘萬、這種數字、表現我們的教育、不曾充分到小學階段的兒童教育、</p>
<p>近來國中輿論漸漸注重文盲的掃除、這實在是緊要的工作、因爲大多數文盲的存在、可以使一切物質建設工作不易推進、可以使一切精神　設工作（如民族意識的灌輸、公民訓練的完成之類）不容易實施、但欲掃除文盲、一方面固然要使一切已逾小學年齡的靑年或成人受最小限度的袖習教育、一方面務使一切學齡兒童受最小限度之義務教育、兩者相較後者較前者尤爲重要、因爲小學義務教育如果不能普及、便不能斷絕文盲的來源、即令現在的文盲都能受一種補習教育、文盲仍將源源而來、因此、我們今後的努力不能不特別注重學齡兒童的義務教育、我國人口、普通估計爲四萬萬、學齡兒童、（假定爲六歲至十二歲）普通估計占全人口十分之一、即四千萬人、現時學齡兒童之在校者如前所述、約一千二百萬人、學齡兒童之未能入校者、約尚有二千八百萬人、如何能使這二千八百餘萬的學齡兒童、一律受最小限度的義務教育、這便是我們當前的嚴重問題、</p>
<p>欲解答這個問題、首須决定這個最小限的義務教育年限、近來政府的假定、社會的主張、似俱認義務教育的年期應定爲四年、可是四年的義務教育制度、决不是一步可以達到的、因此、政府計劃、在使義務教育年限、由一年逐漸加到四年、義務教育實施因此可分爲數期、民國二十四年度至民國二十八年度便可定爲第一期、在此五年之中、各地可次第舉辦學齡兒童的義務教育、義教期間可暫定爲一年、務期於民國二十八年度終了時、一年的義務教育已普及全國各省市、其次則劃民國二十九年度至民國三十三年度爲第二期、屆時學齡兒童義務教育年期可改爲兩年、在這個五年之中、務使兩年義務教育次第普及於各省市、再進一步、則或可逕將義務教育改爲四年、達到預期標準、</p>
<p>至於師資問題、一方面我們固然要添設小學師資養成機關、以爲添設小學之用、但我們如果同時、（一）厲行工部制之編製、（二）充實現時各校的學額、（三）改良私塾則現有師資和校舍尚可利用者亦復不少、如更採用、（四）巡廻教學制（即設置巡廻教師）與（五）導生制、則新師資之需要亦可大减所最難者或者還是經費問題、可是使每一兒童、受一年之義務教育、如辦理得法、國家支出當不過五元左右、果爾、則使現時失學的學齡兒童二千八百萬人、均受一年義務教育、總共需費當不過一萬四千萬元、倘如前述、以五年爲普及一年義務教育的期間、則每年所需爲數尚不滿三千萬元、此費如更由地方與中央分担、醫如說地方負担三分之二、中央補助三分之一、則即令中央財政與地方財政均感困難、目前亦當有法可設、醫如就中央財政言、本年度總歲出約八萬萬元、中央教育費之支出、不過百分之三左右、倘再就總歲出中移撥八十分之一（一千萬元）以充上項</p>
<p>義務教育工作之用、决非不可做到之事、總之、小學義務教育的普及、問題至爲嚴重一方面我們固不可掉以輕心、輕視這個問題的復雜和困難、同時我們也不可把他看得太難尤其不可過於畏難、我們的中央政府和地方政府、尤其是我們全國從事於教育事業的人士、應該從現在起、立下决心、持以毅力、推動並完成這一種民族復興的偉大工作、務使義務教育這個名詞、立即脫離了宣傳鼓吹的階段、進到實行的階段、祗要我們有决心、很努力、蘇聯波蘭等國新近的榜樣、是能給予我們很大的鼓舞的、因爲這些國家、文盲的衆多、在幾年以前和我們的情狀是相彷彿的、</p>
<p>政府最近已經宣告學曆上的民國二十四年底、（二十四年八月至二十五年七月）爲中國的兒童年了、我們熱望大家一致努力、使我們的兒童年、成爲中國小學義務教育眞正開始實施的年期、</p>

<h3>公開手球　孫家祿旗開得勝　二對零戰敗托塔門　鮑山利受意外失敗</h3>
<p>第二屆公開手球單打賽、昨日六時開始奪標、我國新進好手孫家綠初試啼聲、居然一鳴驚人、二十一比九、二十一比九、連勝托塔門、可謂旗開得勝、前程遠大矣、最奇異者、鮑山利受意外打擊、一對二失敗於批安斯、批氏固矯健、但其獲取後勝利者、由於鮑山利之疏忽耳、馬心源初次參加、即未出塲、棄權於對方培克爾使其現亭其成、殊覺不値、昨賽結果</p>

<h3>銀洋形勢奠定　——拆劃依然未更——</h3>
<p>銀洋市面、自上月間趨入正軌以來、近已日見安定、曩昔傾軋之風、爲之掃蕩無餘、昨市塲中洋拆早午兩市均仍掛九分、劃頭亦始終白劃無加水、拆票交易、早市轉賬三百九十餘萬、新交易四十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易六十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖五十餘萬、新做出四十餘萬、鈔票交易收回一百七十餘萬、發出一百四十餘萬、又發出暗記券一百十餘萬、各路滙欵四十餘萬、客路來源四十萬、去胃無聞、銀行收解消息、外商銀行收解票欵二百七十餘萬、電匯欵五十餘萬、各種貨押等雜欵收解三百二十餘萬、特種滙欵七十餘萬、外滙結欵一百十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百十餘萬、電滙欵四十餘萬、特種匯欵五十餘萬、外滙結欵八十餘萬、各種貨墊等欵收解三百二三十萬、出倉九十萬、日商銀行收解票欵一一百五十餘萬、各匯滙貨等雜欵收解二百八十餘萬、外滙結欵八十餘萬、特種匯款六十餘萬、進倉六十萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千一百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百九十餘萬、解現十餘萬、</p>
<p>江南小洋早市仍開八百三十八元、午市略加五角、改爲八百三十八元五角、結果較前日漲五角、做出交易、祇午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市改小三角、爲七百三十四元七角、午市續小七角、爲七百三十四元、結果較前日僅跌一元、做出交易早市十四萬角、午市四萬五千角、銅元仍爲三百三十五千文、交易數額三萬六千八百五十串文、合代價祥一萬一千元、</p>

<h3>證券　美交易所注重雜糧市面</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告昨（三日）紐約股市、參差帶疲、為過去十日內最呆之一日、此由於市面之缺乏推進力、昨日經過、極為平庸、惟合衆冶金續受壓力、末後始起抬頭、本日交易者集中於雜糧方面、雜糧市面、因玉蜀　上升而被帶堅、至玉蜀黍之漲、則因存底之激减云、因雜糧有力、致農具股之趨勢亦轉堅、債市參差略降、小交易所股票甚少軒輊、紐約證券交易所經紀人位置昨售美金六舊五千元、此係一九一九年來最低之價格云、</p>

<h3>紗花　實銷絡繹標紗續漲</h3>
<p>紗市繼續良好、因通來南方對於棉紗需求甚殷、有一部分廠方、現貨業已斷檔、申新廠十七支組紗竟欲分派出貨、日紗根子亦緊、所以有此原因、一般投機者、對於紗市暫無看疲之念、但日商空頭、安然不動、</p>
<p>近期紗漲一元許</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均趨上升、因現紗銷塲良好、海外棉市平穩、甬帮扒空、檯面見緊、但交易不旺、惟一般投機者多數對於棉紗並不看疲、所以生意較鮮、結果各月比上日收盤價漲五·六·七角至一元一角、午後開盤續佳、塲中賣戶缺乏、近期市况愈昂、遠月略挫、結果近月比上午收盤價漲二三角、遠月平平、査賣出達記四百五十包、賡豐四百包、愼記五百五十包、泰昌六百包、大孚四百包、大豐四百五十包、長豐三百五十包、買進裕康四百包、通記四百包、大福四百五十包、長豐一千三百包、潤康三百五十包、元一三百五十包、生源五百五十包、一日間晨高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>本月花有軋空現象</h3>
<p>棉市始堅後跌、市情益覺平澹、實因存棉太厚廠方需要减縮、惟有一部分投機商、對於四月期標花、有軋空之說、故本月獨堅漲三角、但遠月伏况、殊緊衰弱、</p>
<p>遠月花平淡</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一致上漲、因美棉陳跌四至五、新棉漲十餘磅音、印棉亦漲一羅比至三羅比二五、故人心挺秀、本月份最挺、因市塲上有軋空之聲浪、大孚號大批購進、市盤愈拍愈緊、但據一部分消息、日商逢漲時仍拋、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角半、本月獨漲三角半、午後開盤、近月市勢尤硬、但拍至遠月較平、價格一高、引起賣方活動、大孚又來拋賣、而外棉消息不佳、三品棉花趨跌、拍至三收盤轉向下降、結果本月份多頭、拉緊仍不放鬆、未動、遠跌一角至二角、査賣出大孚三千担、通記一千八百担、大豐四千三百担、合興一千担、益昶一千八百担、益豐廉潔千七百担、長和一千担、泰昌一千八百担、元一二千七百担、潤康一千六百担、買進大孚四千九百担、長豐二千八百担、永大一千担、益康一千担、愼昌一千二百担、大福一千一百担、森康一千一百担、協成一千一百担、源興昌二千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美新棉上漲為有力　陳棉亦得爲之穩定</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、軟弱而欠活動、因經紀商多頭了結、與外商賣出、及塲中深信某商家買進外棉而套出美棉、致各月跌小三至十磅音、午時聞農長華萊士在報界會議時、言棉花手續稅在八月一日前、不至增加、同時華爾街方面所得報告、政府對於新棉、不久將定有成效之方法、於是新棉上漲、陳棉亦得站定、據傳利物浦帮因新陳棉相差甚巨、頗有購買、同業及紐奧崙亦有買進、復有空戶抵補、賣戶不多、執貨者擬待政府政策之發展、其後市價反動、尤以近月爲甚、收盤時、陳棉跌四磅音、新棉漲十至十五磅音、現貨跌五磅音、英棉現貨跌四點、期貨跌一二點、印棉因現需良好、空戶抵補及投機買進而昂、計平果爾漲就·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲一·五羅比、白羅溪漲三·二五羅比、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>

<p>洋米　銷仍旺、江浙內地需要甚殷、本街與南京方面續有辦裝、而囤買依然心堅不出、貨主扳俏更力市乃續升四五分至六七分不一、全日開出西貢二萬包左右、其他各米亦有近萬包、客秈爲內地爭辦、本街則應酬不多、市乃與洋米同一向上、但貨主並不堅持、行情祗大二三分、售開湘　各米二千四百包、多爲內地辦去云、</p>
<p>粳米</p>
<p>昨日滬南共到二十餘號（貸共四千餘石）、自前市一經轉軟後、本街銷塲、仍以雨阻、更形寥落、且包胃自經一番漲風、亦復呆頓、惟烟台帮辦四五百包、故形勢更軟、市色趨下、其餘各厚粳及薄稻價、難以立足、卒見回跌一二角不等、而陰變元等均隨落一二角、滬北河下各路來源、祇有四五號、河存已稀、店方上市廖寥、市上各貨銷塲淸淡異常、市價白粳轉小一角左右、薄稻到雖缺乏、價帶疲數分、其餘各貨、亦見軟勢、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>凡是人類，各佃心坎裏知足的成分越多，便是毀滅的危險性越少。不信睛看侵略家的不知足，就有遭受總攻擊而覆亡的危險；投機家的不知足，就有身敗名裂或致自殺的危險。……惟有一事越是不知足，越沒有危險而反使你生活上得到安全的，便是不斷的精研學問和技藝。</p>
<p>一個人單是做一個妄想的夢，那還容易喚醒；假使做了這夢還連帶做起複雜的夢中夢來，那就不易喚醒了！例如平空想發財，這個夢很是單純的，發財想不到，就易醒悟；但是在做發財夢的當兒，接着做起確定式的發財後怎樣蓋造洋房怎樣購汽車討姨太太的計劃的夢中夢來，那就難以喚醒其迷夢啊！</p>
<h3>作如是觀</h3>
<p>— 王鏡淵</p>
<p>偶　躅街頭，或徜徉人海中，靜觀芸芸衆生之形形色色，較之遊動物園，實更有意味。</p>
<p>以性狀言：有勇猛如獅的，有膽小如鼠的，有貪狠如狼的，有馴順如羊的，有狡猾如狐的，有陰險如狐的，有毒如蛇蝎的，有蠢如鹿豕的，有×如××的……各色的人，儘可以各色動物象徵之，則腦海中卽呈現一各色動物活躍之現象：或為性慾而追求，或為食物而爭鬥；其目的不外求解决其天性需要之食色問題，固無殊於其他動物，亦豈得云罪過哉？惟其技巧實已勝過其他動物：如綁票，局騙，賣淫，箱屍，什麼淫婦殺夫，什麽謀財害命等等，都非其他動物所能做到。觀高等動物為食色而活躍，較之遊動物園有天性汨沒坐享食色之動物，豈非更有意味？</p>
<p>人本是由動物進化來的，過於認眞，徒生煩腦；作如是觀，則泰然自得矣！</p>
<p>卽以作者生活而論：作「坐冷板橙」觀。便覺無聊；設以「猴猻王」自居，南面而坐，發號施令，和小猴子們跳東跳西，宛然西遊記中花果山芙猴王之境地，不亦快哉！不亦快哉！</p>
<p>又如某日晚上，在蓬萊路上遇見一羣男的圍着一個女的步行。我想：要是實行張競生提倡的美的裸體遊行，把衣服脫得一絲不掛，在月色之下，比羣狗身上披着一件皮袍，追逐雌狗，當更美過萬倍。</p>
<h3>王瞎子</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>在我們這個鎭落上，沒有一個人不知道王瞎子的大名。其實王瞎子是一個討飯的呌化子，為什麽又値得去記他呢？可是這一個乞丐名聲太大了，非但本鎭上人人知道，就是相近方圓數十里的人，也都知道他的為人。</p>
<p>他每逢朔望，必在市上行乞，所經各商號，或住戶，須要討到一枚銅元纔肯走路，起初是很覺難行，日子久了，各家見到他沒有走上階沿，早就把銅子揑在手上等他了。</p>
<p>可是他很能儉省，把所討到的銅子儲蓄起來，竟有千元之數，有許多小商人向他借錢，他要二分半利息，像這樣，錢是越滾越多了。</p>
<p>近年來他收了不少寄子，富有人家的子弟是很嬌養的，呌化子是很賤的，意思是寄給呌化子做兒子，就很容易長大了。他每年的端午節，買了許多扇子手帕去贈給寄子，受了他的禮物人家，都得送一二塊大洋給他，所以他遇到節邊，總是酒啊，肉啊，吃個不了。</p>
<p>前天是他的六十壽辰，來了許多徒子徒孫小乞丐外，並來了不少親家大人和寄子，急得他沒有辦法，跑到酒館店去包了十來桌酒席，大大的哄鬧一回，像這種乞丐，倒可以稱頌他一聲奇丐呢。</p>
<h3>懷孕</h3>
<p>— 黃白鶯</p>
<p>懷孕，這回事，在女性們生的旅程上，誰都無法避免的吧？有的，那就是生理上起了變態的女子。</p>
<p>一個女子懷孕的時候，在男性們看來，總覺得含有無限的神秘的。尤其是那些美貌年靑的姑娘，新婚未久，突然搖擺着高凸的肚子走出門口來，就特別成了許多專管女人閒事的男子們目光的集中點。在各個眉目的表情間，又好像都有一個共同的驚嘆的問號：「她的肚子怎麽高得這樣快！」</p>
<p>本來，懷孕是男女們結合之後的一種必然現象，並沒有什麼了不得的，而女子們所以認為怕羞的，却是為了體格的美醜問題。與女子對於結婚的怕羞心理，前後不同的。</p>
<p>如果，已經經過了兩次生產或一次生產的女子，對於懷孕，却成了一件極普通的事了。</p>
<p>一個初期懷孕的女子，在當時的生活，感到了不安之外，精神上也是非常不安的，因為本能地預期着生產時的極端的苦痛。</p>
<p>到底，懷孕是件可喜的事，遝是件可悲的事呢？</p>
<p>從我的感覺下，懷孕確是件可悲的事。——一般希望着兒子傳代的資本者當然例外。——一對年靑的夫妻，如果妻子一旦懷孕了，在妻子固然不快，為丈夫的更是苦惱。靑年們正是享受愛情的黃金時代，倘若有了一個兒子夾在當中，那末，男女間的愛情往往起了變化，甚至於破裂。而况有了兒子，在已經無可辦法的生活費上還要加上一筆嬰孩的支出呢！</p>
<p>許多方面的意見都是一致的，年靑的人兒不應該懷孕，然而，誰又能想出一個安全的辦法來，制止這種生理上的必然呢？沒有吧？永遠是不可能呵！</p>
<p>可怕的懷孕！可怕的懷孕！</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>浣花道：你笑什麽？你們都也得過我的好處的。你知道的，這幾天我是窮的不得了。我不找兩個錢用用怎麽辦。今天下雨，我不回去了，這屋子我還用一天。茶房笑道：我又沒說什麽，你自己倒咭咕了一陣。你又何必開房問，你就搬到隔壁去住，不省下了這筆錢嗎？浣花道：你不必胡說，我是留在這裏，要和賈先生作媒，並沒有別的意思。茶房道：你說的是西路來的那位小姑娘嗎？早已說得有個七八成了，還要你作什麼媒？浣花微笑道：靠你們那種說法，那一天得成功，我一說，馬上就要喝喜酒的。只這喜酒兩個字，還不曾說完，外面早有人接着道：喜酒總是要喝的。說着話，那人已是走了進來，連連的向他拱了兩下手道：恭喜恭喜！浣花看時，乃是李士廉。便笑道：你恭喜我作什麽？作媒的人，不過是同別人跑跑腿。李士廉笑道：你還同我裝模糊呢？我巳經早得了茶房的報吿了。這時，茶房已經出去了，浣花紅了臉，向他低聲道：茶房同你報吿的是些什麽話？李士廉笑道：你作了什麽事，他就報吿了什麽話。浣花總怕是報吿自己偷錢的那件事。因道：他是說我到賈先生屋子裏去了嗎？李士廉笑道：他不是說你去了，却是說賈先生到了你屋子裏來了。浣花對於其他的事，倒不想瞞着，便向士廉笑道：不錯，是有這件事，還多謝着你上次的介紹啦。要不是你們介紹在先，那就到現在為止，我還是不認識賈先生的。李士廉笑道：我知道的你的目的，並不在於他的錢，你和他談了一些什麽條件呢？（一七四）</p>
<h3>青島櫻花</h3>
<p>— （金俊仁）</p>
<p>櫻花為三島　國花，吾國人向不重視，靑島櫻花，實其交還之遺產。芳春三月，草肥柳綠之際，花開滿樹，炫燦若雲錦，近而觀之，若少女薄脂，玉頰微酡，遠而觀之，類萬丈銀綾，光華奪目。今日櫻花最多之處，一為中山公園，一為日本神社。日本神社，為日人私有之區，故國人甚少涉足，中山公園，即全為國人遊賞之地。春日花發，萬頭攢擠，各處商號，且於圜中支架設棚，暫時營業，即靑地所謂櫻花會是也。會期初無定規，約以一週為止，過此花即凋零，遊人裏足矣。園中有櫻花路與雙櫻花路之稱，前者於路之兩旁，各植櫻樹一株，後者於路之兩旁，各植二株，夾路櫻花，相映如錦人行其下，百慮都銷矣。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>待到晚上，太陽光已收歛之後，這些已染好而猶未晒乾的絲，就得打石坪中收進屋來，以免晚上起暴風雨，把了那些顏色打壞。在屋子裏是不用竹桿的，而是用一種特製的木架來把它們一絞一絞地套起來的。這些木架是做得很講究的，</p>
<p>且還漆着極美觀的顏色。有時候在自天裏，做絲的人也有直接把這些木架子抬出去晒絲的，這樣就可省却一番從架子上取下來，再掛到竹桿上去的手續了。</p>
<p>這些製絲的女孩子們是不需穿什麽宮裝或禮服的，伊們儘可自由穿着各種輕便靈巧的服裝；好在伊們閑的時候也很多，正好把這些工夫都用在裁製自己的衣服上面。所以伊們每天都是打扮得像過時過節一樣的。且因人多有比較的緣故，伊們便格外的起勁；要不是怕太后見了責駡，伊們也許會比妓女打扮得更俏麗呢！（二八五）</p>

<h3>案頭清供</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>在塵囂的都市裏，有牕明几凈的一個小小書齋，眞是幸福不淺！有了小小的書齋，便應該佈置整齊，雖然不必鄴架琴床，桃笙塵尾；可是湘簾靜捲，典籍橫陳，是少不得的。至於案頭的布置，也應該講究，旣可娛目騁懷，怡情悅性；又可點綴美觀，含藝術的意味。植物學家說：「植物的枝葉，能够吐氧吸碳。」人們的呼吸，吐的碳酸氣，需要的是氧氣。案頭有了植物的陳設，不是把室內的碳氣吸去，氧氣補充起來嗎？淸潔空氣，輔助呼吸，植物跟人有密切的關係了。</p>
<p>案頭淸供，除了假山一座，金魚數尾，要算盆花缾卉為最佳了。夷塲十里，無一邱一壑可以遨遊，閒暇的時候，游目假山，細數游魚，不是有登山臨水之樂嗎？至於盆花瓶卉，最宜於案頭者，計有下列數種：</p>
<p>（一）水仙　歲朝淸供，以紅梅，南天竹，水仙為雋品，這是陳列在廳事上的。只有瓷盆內的水仙，却可為案頭淸供。凌波仙子，分外的丯姿娉婷。這時候，紅梅巳謝，它跟蘭蕙，盛在玉槃金盞，淸芬撲鼻，幽艷動人，豈不是令人心醉嗎。它在植物學上，是每年生草本，葉細長，脈並行，有塊狀的地下莖。種在瓷盆中，護以石子，盛以淸水，比芙蕖蘭蕙，還要淸潔呢。</p>
<p>（二）佛手柑　香　，北瓜，都是案頭的陳列品；而佛手柑尤為雋妙。羣芳譜說：「佛手柑木如朱樂，葉尖長有刺。」其實，它是常綠灌木，產於閩廣等地，跟香櫞同種。葉　圓，葉腋有刺，和橘，柚，柑等植物是一般的。春時開五瓣白花，到了夏末實熟，色黃，上端分裂如人指，所以有佛手的名稱。咱在植物裏，最喜歡葫蘆跟佛乎柑，它們的姿態，巧妙玲瓏，多麼動人，造物眞不可思議啊！　　佛手，淸香襲人，母須拈花，巳自結印，案顯淸伴，也足以澈悟眞如妙諦了。</p>
<p>（三）石菖蒲　菖蒲是生於水邊的多年生草本。葉片細長的，是它們的變種，名呌「石菖蒲」。種在瓦盂中，靑翠悅目，放在案頭，不但可供欣賞，也是有益於衛生的吓。</p>

<h3>儒生之用</h3>
<p>— 楊昌溪</p>
<p>本來中國的文人歷來便沒有給人以甚麼好的印象，固然歷代帝王都在天下太平時做些『文以載道』的工作，但是從事文學的人也只以文學爲進身之階，正所謂『學優而仕』，而實際上只是做一種帮閒的玩意兒，不是替人作詩作賦以供人消遣，便是純然成了一種歌功頌德的工具，眞正說是做到苟子儒效篇中所稱道的『儒效』，幾千年也找不出許多。</p>
<p>古代的文人多半是被人稱作『儒生』，周公的輔佐成王，『教誨開導成王使諭於道，而能掩跡於文武』。而他的行爲被稱爲非聖人不能爲，故稱爲『大儒之效』。其他比較次等的儒者，『法先王，隆禮義，謹乎臣子而致貴其上者也。人主用之，則執在本朝而宜。不用則退，編百姓而慇，必爲順下矣。雖窮困凍餒，必不以邪道爲貪，無置錐之地，而明於持社稷之大義。』其他，等而下之的儒者，那便卑卑不足道了。</p>
<p>儒者旣有上述的『儒效』，怎麼又被人罵爲無用的東西呢？這自然與當時的社會環境有關係，而自己之不務實際也是很大的原因。關於社會環境，從歷代文人的詩文中所表現的牢騷之語已足够說明了。他們的牢騷所嘲罵諷詠的有十分之八九是『知遇』一類的東西。恰如劉勰在文心雕龍的知音篇中所說似的：『知音其難哉！音實難知，知實難逢，逢其知音，千載其一乎？』卽使說有了知音，然而知音也只爲了愛新鮮。比如說：『儲說始出，子虛初成，秦皇漢武恨不同時。旣同時矣，則韓囚而馬輕……』這樣已經使文士們　嘆着知遇之難了，再加以類似『同行相嫉妒』的文人相輕，在崇己抑人中，不僅只是如莊周之笑折楊，宋玉之傷白雪呢。再加以自己的『不尚實際，徒尚空言』免不了四處碰釘子。卽使說一朝技得其售，然而能『坐言起行』『踏實苦幹』的人却如鳳毛麟角。這樣，講玄學，尚空談的儒生，與尚實際的功利主義者（？）相比衡起來，免不了要人譏爲：『文學裒心博帶，竊周公之服，鞠躬踧踖；竊仲尼之容，議論稱誦之竊商賜之　，刺譏言治：過管晏之才，心卑卿，志小萬乘：及授之政，昏亂不治。……』（桓寬鹽鐵論利議篇）。卽是晚儒生們也能從有司的職責上去非難他們的措施，甚而爲自己的尚空談掩飾說『無世位雖堯舜不能治萬民』，然而言論的空疏，行事的散漫，只有退而怨天尤人了。</p>
<p>文人相輕雖是如曹丕所說的『自古而然，於今尤烈，』但是我覺得能佔在文人的立塲以非難文人，而反能替文人指出途徑的要算是苟子。他在非十二子一篇中，力非假戰國之世『飾邪說文姦言以梟亂天下，矞宇嵬瑣，使天下混然不知是非治亂之所存者。』有陳仲，史猷，墨翟，宋鈃，愼到，田駢，惠施，鄧柝，魏牟，它弼，子思，孟軻等十二人。子思孟軻原是他的先師，然而他也不客氣的加以非難，認爲子思孟軻之罪在『略法先王而不知其統，猶然而材劇志大，聞見雜博：案往舊造說謂之五行，甚僻違而無類，幽隱而無說，閉約而無解。』因此案飾其辭而祇敬之曰，那眞是先君子（孔子）之言，在子思的唱道和孟軻的隨和中，世俗便被他們所欺。在荀子的意念中，他看不起不能總方略，齊言行，壹統類，和不能能羣天下之英傑而告之以大古教之以至順，不能具在客堂之內，　席之上具備聖王之文章和勃然興起平世之俗的一些儒生們，他理想中人所構成的人物是要能『上則法舜禹之制，下則法仲尼子弓之義以務息。』如果能做到這點，則一切爭思以其道易天下的便無隙可乘，而『天下之害除，仁人之事畢，聖王之跡著矣。』但是古今那有眞正這樣的儒者呢？</p>
<p>現代世風日薄，腐儒已日見淘汰，摩登化的十二子之徒，所在皆是，大家都想取巧以成名致富，誰個還甘願埋頭苦幹以當書呆子？</p>
<h3>柘皋行</h3>
<p>— 高植</p>
<p>從合肥到巢　正在築火車的路基，路基佔去了民田，田主卽　得到地價，而田賦還須照完，農民做不起呈文告狀，報紙的輿論也沒有，於是有人向某　主說，託他向一位做監察院委員的親戚去提議一件彈劾案。</p>
<p>柘皋是一個小地方，可是在商業繁榮時，英美烟公司的香烟一年可消到兩千箱，每箱納國稅八十元，於是一個小地方在英美烟公司的香烟上就要一年擔負十六萬元國稅，其他可想而知。可是近年來，商業蕭條，農村的貧困更形尖銳化，如以一九二八年的商業的指數爲一百，則一九三四年的柘臯商業的指數只是三十左右，被火油趕進窮鄉僻壤的菜油燈又重行走了出來，許多點火油的人家也火油菜油並用了。城市與鄉村共同表現了高度的窮。</p>
<p>那些老實的農民連「自手到口」的生活也難以維持，有的負着租價，有的負着錢債，債主們自己也無法維持，於是逼租的逼租，逼積的逼債，還得出的便還，還不出的只好一捉將官裏去」而那些旣無能力償還又無勇氣奮鬭而限於飢餓與債務雙重壓迫之下的農民只好死，或者服鴉片烟，或者上吊，鴉片烟在內地是和米同樣的容易買，而上吊是更無須破費。</p>
<p>那些稍微活潑一點的，旣不曾有機會受教育，當然不知窮的根本原因和奮鬥的目標與方法，又不甘活活地餓死，唯一的辦法是挺而走險，那些站在農民頭上吃得飽長得胖的人在彈簧椅上講仁義道德，連茅舍也住不安的所謂「狡　」的農民只好在黃土路上爲匪打刧，他們搶的是同類的鄉下人，往往在黃昏時分，身上帶着幾十個銅板的人也有被打刧的</p>
<p>他們是眞的無糧充飢，連被一般人所重視的「年飯」也是許多貧民無法預備的，不做匪便要餓死，於是在舊歷新年前後，家鄕大鬧匪鷥。雖然在除夕那天槍斃了「不法的」土匪、可是搶刧案還是有的發生，而大股十匪更在合肥與巢縣交界處醞釀着打刧一城鎭的行當·於是地方上一天天恐慌、小集鎭被刧的消息時有所開，兩縣出兵隊會剿，然而土匪是無法勦完的，至少在飢餓的恐慌未解决之前。許多鄉村裏不但找不出三塊現洋，連三斗白米也找不出，吃的是黃蘿蔔，野菜·荍麥，山芋，玉蜀黍之類，預料舊歷二三月之間就有餓死人的可能。</p>
<p>許多農村家庭離開了本鄕而到城市去謀生活，尤其是女子。而連傭僱也等待不及的人或陷于絕境的人就只得賣女兒給人家做婢僕，而以女孩子賣給人家作使女的爲最多。普通三四十元卽可賣得很伶俐的女孩子·法律上雖然男女平等，禁止販賣人口，可是由于貧窮與飢餓，內地販賣人口的事是和「土店」裏公然賣「黑飯」那麼平常，卽在南京我也見到難民在中山路上呌賣孩子，聽到販賣女子的事實。</p>
<p>另一個救急的辦法便是賈淫。城市裏貧家女子賣淫固是常事，這淫風却隨同洋貨與梅毒吹進了鄉村，鄕村的婦女爲貪圖金錢而到城市鎭集上去賣淫，代價每次不過一元兩元，少的甚至於只有兩三十銅板，雖然在都市中人的眼光裏是這麼少，然而在鄉村的赤貧的無知的婦女看來却是可觀的。於是花柳病由都市傳給城鎭之後又由城鎭而傳給鄕村，鄉村裏沒有新式醫院，病菌愈傳愈廣，致形成烟毒與梅毒「深入民間」而眞正「努力下層工作」，抬轎的也要抽雅片烟，無辜的農民也要染上花柳病毒。</p>
<p>短短的十多天讓我重行溫習了一下內地下層階級的生活，販賣人口及其他可憐的事件，使我麻木了兩年的腦經生了一點疲倦的反應，雖有什麼要說的，也不像從前那樣有興致去說了。</p>
<h3>論寫作的動機</h3>
<p>— 白萊</p>
<p>「我對於自己有沒有天才，以及我所寫的東西是好是壞，那是滿不在乎的。我只是訴說着自己。而且，那便是我所需要的一切。爲什麼呢？因爲，在我以爲，著作並不是對於某一樣東西的效勞，只不過是爲發展自己的手段而已·」阿爾志巴綏夫曾經這樣地自白過。像這種光以「發展自己」而寫作的動機，是從古就有的。其所以在今日來得更露骨，更俗流：那只不過是說明：個人底生活的範圍被不合理的社會制度所局限到無可再縮小的時候，「寫作」對於那些看重自己過於一切的人，就成爲了爭取個人底生命綫爲目的的手段了。</p>
<p>自然，人非聖賢，有幾個能忘得掉自己。何况有不少聖賢，正如伏爾泰所說還是大騙子。所以像巴爾札克那樣只要將自己的忠誠傾注在每一篇製作裏，而其目的卽使僅是爲了「還債」而寫作，仍不失爲偉大的作者。這裏，問題是在作爲一個作者，爲了達到寫作以外的目的，不惜强姦眞實，因而成爲一根毒草，委實這是使人嘔心的事。我現在纔有所領悟：爲什麼先前有過一個作者呌出了「我要脫離文人隊伍」的呼聲。正因爲旣爲文人，就最愛維護「自己」。再說，我們這文壇，埋歿了不少文學靑年的心血，是衆所周知的事。然而我們這些後進的筆耕者，往往爲了過於看重「自己」的心血，因而對前輩有所咒詛，有所埋怨，甚至有所辱罵；同樣也是不足爲訓的。</p>
<p>明白這一點，那麽「明白」的作者，將不再是爲了自己的虛榮，地位，名利……而寫作的，這是可以預期的事。由於生產制度的社會化，將使人突破了「自己」而是爲「社會」而寫作。而且，也只有這樣的作者，纔配在萬千讀衆的心靈裏築起不朽的紀念碑。</p>
<h3>菜販梁鬍子</h3>
<p>— 吳廣略</p>
<p>已經是嚮午時分了。</p>
<p>菜販梁　子肩頭上仍是滿滿的一担菜。淸晨，他從家裏出發時，在肩上重壓着的是這担菜，現在還是這担菜；對於時光一分一秒的推移過去，以及跟蹡的從此村跋涉到彼村的疲勞，是如此的徒勞無功！梁鬍子戚到生意的冷淡與絕望，不禁老淚滂沱，而低低的嗆　身世之悲凉了。</p>
<p>他今年已五十一歲，頭髮稀疏而斑白，眼睛深陷，鬍鬚黑而柔長，顴骨高突，牙齒脫落，……總之他的一切已是暮態龍鍾的徵象。像他這年紀，如果他投的是富人的娘胎，他一定是整日吃閑飯，陪伴孫子享度晚年的淸福。可是造物對他是多麼不敬呀，現在他爲了老妻和自己的一日兩餐就得拚命勞碌奔波！「生活」這回事在他是如此的嚴重而殘酷呢！</p>
<p>「阿要買靑菜？」</p>
<p>他躑躅於巷尾巷頭，兀自啞澀的呼喊。他底發抖的聲調在寂靜的空問迴響着，愈含蓄一種悽苦情調。臨當這樣的荒年凶歲，各鄉民均感到生活的極度艱難，必需品的「飯」尚幾乎無力顧及，何能有餘錢買菜？儘管梁鬍子拉高嗓子力竭聲嘶的呼喊，也終是徒然了。</p>
<p>「世界變啦！」</p>
<p>他又啞聲的歎道。他追憶以前的往事：那時候，早上擔着滿籃的菜出門，　巡了三兩個村莊卽賣個精光。他想起菜擔停下時各鄕民爭先恐後地購買的　况；他想起當靑菜賣完時獨個兒悠閑的上茶館的樂趣：他想起這種種，嘴角上又閃現笑浪。而今呵，他足足跑遍大小五個村莊·而菜仍是那麼滿滿的一擔！這椿嚴酷事件的打擊，他的嘴裏不禁又悽愴而沉啞的歎息一陣。</p>
<p>他絕望地無可如何的又朝向別個村莊跑去。他焦急地看看太陽，又看看籃裏的菜：他正在默默的考量他的貨物的命運。太陽底閃爍的光芒，照射他的汗痕淋漓的瘦臉，那臉孔就像暴雨中的泥塑像，令人看了哀憐而駭怕。他底炯炯發光的眼睛凝視着沉悶的蒼穹，宛如一個虔誠祈　的基督徒般的默默宣示：</p>
<p>「老天爺，換一換年頭兒就好了……」</p>
<p>他在荒漠而灣曲的村道上走着。　圍死寂無聲。當此殯窖一般悲慘的寂寬人間，他在飽受肩上菜擔重壓之餘，一切美麗的愚妄的幻夢便在他的腦海裏浮沉。像他那樣愚昧的老翁，他除了聽天由命外又那裏懂得什麼人可以改變一切呢？</p>
<h3>巨卿先生（七）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>當校董，自然非得在鎮上有地位有聲望的人莫屬了。例如有名的紳士章嘯峯，就有這樣的資格。在本任以前，他曾經連任了五年區立小學校的校董，由他的令弟嘯岩主持一切，担任校長。前三年不知怎麼一來，嘯岩先生忽然因爲一個同學的提携，當選了縣黨部的委員；接着章嘯峯也榮任了本鎭區公所的籌備主任，兄弟倆都飛黃騰達起來。手一鬆，區立小學校的校董就換了人，由鎭上的商會會長褚潤夫祖任了。</p>
<p>本來大家都是塲面上人，而且私人交誼極好的，「熱心教育」自然大可無分彼此。可是自從去年夏犬，章嘯峯的公子幼雄從縣立中學畢業了回來，在家裏閑了半年以後，情形又發生了一點變化。</p>
<p>據說近兩年區立小學校的成績不好，於是一開春就有人發動改選校董，結果是章嘯峯重作馮婦，又當了選。</p>
<p>接着章少爺幼雄走馬上任，接收了校長的位置。</p>
<p>不過事情好像還沒有這樣簡單，一方面學校已經開了學，向各方面收取經費，却都說前校董收去了；　前校　的經濟，　日，以及重要文件，全沒有移交。交涉了好幾回，沒結果，於是風潮醞釀起來了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>青年應該讀那一類書</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>復古運動中所表現出來的，自然是古氣森然。像最近各大小書店，却在翻印着什麼四庫全書，圖書集成，二十五史，二十六史之類的古書，這也是復古的一現象。</p>
<p>在目前的中國，喜歡向古書堆裏翻筋斗的，實大有其人。中了古書毒的不算，他們大都把自己看做古人為榮。一班時之聖者，為了本身的地位計，也不得不假裝為好古家，在書架上點綴了幾部古書，以示推行復古運動的熱誠。還有極力主張和提倡讀古書的，又有被迫非讀古書不可的。於是古書便應運而翻印起來了！</p>
<p>不過現今的知識階級，旣然有人喜歡讀古書，自然就有翻印古書的需要。在另一方面，旣然有人喜歡讀新書，自然也就有編選新書的需要。這都是題外的話。</p>
<p>問題是在這裏：目下中國出版界，古書在翻印了，新書也在編選了，凡爲一個現代中國青年的我們，應當去讀古書，研究一點古學問呢？還是應當去讀新書，吸收一些新知識呢？這個問題如果不是全無意義，那倒也有提出來加以討論的必要。</p>
<p>以我們的眼光看，現代中國靑年，應該讀新書，而不應該讀古書。理由是這樣的：</p>
<p>第一，學問這種東西，是日新月異的。故我們正時刻追求新知識之不暇，那裏還有閒工夫去翻閱古書？</p>
<p>第二，知識是一種生活工具。現代人應當過現代生活，故現代中國靑年，也就應該獲取一點新知識，以便適應生活環境。</p>
<p>第三，一國的文化，只有向前進才是生路，退後轉便會陷於滅亡。現代中國靑年，負有促進中國文化向前發展的使命。故我們的工作，便是創造新文化。</p>
<p>第四，古書卽使是至寳，但我們只有從新書裏，才可以得到各種切合時代需求的知識。</p>
<p>因此，當翻印古書之風正在盛行的今日，我們還能有這一部中國新文學大系可看，這眞可說是現代中國靑年的幸運！</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>「三月靑草綠如油，咱家乘洋去飄流：春潮滾滾千般遠，姐兒田頭千般愁。」唱着，噪嗓子的歌聲又悠悠地在河面上浮起了：這簡單的，通俗的句子，配着一連串的生硬的鄕音，卽使難聽，但却多够呌老船夫神往啊。一種故士的懷念像濃霧那樣的不可抑止地騰起來，跟着這親切與熟悉的士音，故鄉的山川在幻想與記憶中出現了，古鄕的親屬朋友的臉出現了，故鄉的少年時代的胭脂色的可愛的浪跡也出現了——年靑的史頁還很淸楚地浮在眼前呢，而時代却已經毫不容情地轉過了一個殘酷得發靑的醜臉，人披着老年的喪服在它面前發抖，好的日子是，終於像打船底下馳過的浪花，像春天的早潮，一個推着一個，永永地，絕不回顧地，向着無窮盡的前方逝去，又消散了。</p>
<p>五十歲開外的年紀，還是那麼帶着先天的愛海，愛水的本性，孤獨地打着一艘小船：微風也好，狂颷也好，總是一天都不肯休閑地在河面上飄，等着岸上客人的喊呌：「喂，船老大，渡河哪，渡河哪！」於是，一面打着腔呼應，一面感激而急切地把船靠攏去，讓客人上船，跟着就把船向對岸拉過去，客人渡了河，上岸的時候，留下十個五個銅子，便那樣地每天把銅子聚集起來，糶米，量汕，年上節上也許上街順便剪一丈花靑布，要是有幾個銅子多的話，便把多下來的積成銀角，又從銀角積成一塊大洋鈿，把來藏在艙板下面的搭褳袋裏。於是，長蛇一般的歲月便那麼輕易地一頁一頁地翻過去了，模糊得簡直像芕。</p>
<p>（也是有爹媽有媳婦孩子的人唔，可是家鄉在一串時日後面像了一個花砲：打仗啦，打來打去，在許多年代前的一個日子上，鄉裏來了一營大兵，跟着沒到一個月便開起火來了，二個老的一個吃了子彈，一個害了　疾死了，才過門不到一年的年靑的媳婦，也在一個夜晚給五個大兵從床底下拉了去，肚子裏還留着一胎五個月的身子，還……</p>
<p>家已經斷送在一蓬火裏了，自家兒述夜奔了三十里的泥潭路，又混在死屍堆裏裝死人、那樣才得在三晝夜後逃了性命，浪着像化子啦。一年半載後仗打完了，回到家裏：屋子也完了，女人跟爹媽也完了，就祇剩擱在泥澤裏的一艘破落的小渡船。</p>
<p>低下頭，河裏漲起四月裏的潮水來了，船漂像秋天的葉子，便：抹一抹潤濕了的眼睛，拖着破船浪出來了。）</p>
<p>從此就忘掉了家，忘掉了世界，却把老水手的浪歌調兒學來啦：「噯呀噯，漂了五湖又四海；春潮春潮你且走，漢子出門不回頭！」</p>
<p>春天的潮水是不知道回身流的，男子漢的飄流是不知道回家走的。這麼着，五十年的時光便跟着一年一次的春潮中的銀光閃耀着過去了，老船夫是沒有家的，老船夫的家鄉是蕩動着春潮的水國啊。</p>
<p>船，終於在一生的漂蕩中也顯得破敗起來了，而人呢？……不，當春三月的風重又吹起的時侯，迎着河水的汹湧，老船夫可也嘆息，也想起一點什麼來了，悠悠的，有着無窮盡的深遠。</p>
<p>猛地一聲「喂」！——岸上有人呌渡來了。</p>
<h3>煩惱之日</h3>
<p>— 丁星</p>
<p>鋤頭往下掘，心裏却不在掘。</p>
<p>心裏旋轉着許多事，旋轉得頭都發痛，想來想去，結果什麼也想不通。</p>
<p>—薛家的兩担欠租，已經是隔年的了，難道這年尾還挨得過？先打算這吧</p>
<p>—但是，李禿子那三分利的二十塊，月月吃利錢可當不住的！他媽的！借他二十塊，還利息也還够本錢數月　！</p>
<p>—街頭那些碎賬，也不是小數目了，除非你不想在街上走，這些怎樣賴得去？……</p>
<p>—那寃孽，婊子生的！敢說嫌我窮！就是我阿大窮到討飯吧，做老婆的該駡我「沒出息。嗎？眞眞是沒良心的婊子</p>
<p>氣洶洶地，鋤頭往下掘，心裏却不在掘：「拚！」的一聲，鋤頭踫到了一塊石，火星濺向四面；猛醒地舉起鋤頭來一看，「媽的！一大缺！」他吐了一口口唾罵。</p>
<p>工作就這樣停下來，向前走幾步，在一塊靑石上坐下了。太陽在頭上曬着，曬得　暖暖地，沒有風，有，只一點點——是一個吹南風的暖冬天下午。</p>
<p>一條條靑筋在額頭暴漲着，阿大像在做夢：他回想到三年前父親死時留下給他的一滿倉薯米，幾截光番——呵，那白鎧　的光番！如今都那裏去了？可不是全在討那死妖精時花光了的？而現在，現在自己窮了，連她他變成這個樣子！</p>
<p>—天下眞眞有這樣的事？雷不會劈死的！終於又兇兇地站了起來，搶似地握起鋤頭，向下狠狠就掘，「拚」又是一塊石頭！一塊石？他俯下頭，不錯，正是先前那一塊！</p>
<p>—見鬼！連石頭也尋我作對麼？得啦！就算今天附了鬼吧，回他媽的去！</p>
<p>於是背起了鋤頭，沿着曲折的田墘向村裏緩緩走去；心似乎掛在另一個世界，微風拂着他面部的漲熱，但他一點也不曾覺得。</p>
<p>—喂！阿大！過天把那幾塊米賬就送過來，怎樣？</p>
<p>是村口那間米店的老板隔着櫃檯喊出來的。他被喊得猛一抬頭，才知道自己已經進村裏了，便停住步，向米店老板望一望，隨卽回答：</p>
<p>—是啦！曉得的，不要天天儘管催罷！</p>
<p>在遠遠地望見家裏兩扇掩着的半門時，早晨吵鬧的一齣卽時加甚地擾攪他的心緒，煩惱使他有些不想回家去：但</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>是一雙不由主意的脚終於把他移到鬥前了。</p>
<p>爲着要向裏頭的人表示一　威風，他舉起脚把門重重踢進去，他想：假如這一下眞生了效力，她立刻就會出來　見自己，那便什麼都算了吧！</p>
<p>然而裏面是靜寂寂的，不但不見人出來，而且述「誰呀？」的一聲也沒有，「野種！賭氣睡去了吧！」他心裏罵着跨進門　，卸下鋤頭，順手向門　角就是一丟，氣洶洶地衝進房裏去。</p>
<p>房裏是黑暗的，剛進房，什麼都看不見，他忍着氣，停了好一會，然後定睛向床上一看：一點人影都沒有，床是空空的。</p>
<p>一個威覺，迅速地闖進他意識，心裏一跳，趕忙轉過頭來：旁邊那口他僅有的箱子，開得空洞洞地像被刦過似的正對着他呢！</p>
<p>—呵，　了！憤怒立刻從他身上沈了下去，眼前一陣昏花，他把呆直直的身子向床上一倒……</p>
<p>外面傳來一聲「阿大在家嗎」的喊聲。</p>
<h3>春雨</h3>
<p>— 林峯</p>
<p>也正是沉沉的天，</p>
<p>也正是霏霏的雨，</p>
<p>也正是濛濛的湖面；</p>
<p>你說：沉沉的天是風雨之辰，</p>
<p>霏霏的雨是離別的淚，</p>
<p>濛濛的湖面有弧帆在趕程。</p>
<p>那是幾年前的事了，臨到別離的時候，我們都正在這個湖面上話別；那時各人都懷着一顆靑年人的心，要作一點爲着人的事業，要堅沉，要勇敢，要轟烈：在細雨霏霏的時候，我們各趕上各人的路程；我們之中，有人把濛濛的湖面當作一種惡勢力，靑年人的心力，使得靑年人要濛濛裏去開闢一條道，卽使只剩下孤帆，也是要鼓棹前行，卽使湖面再濛濛，濛濛裏也一定讓靑年人開出一條路。我們都這樣想，在細雨霏霏，湖面濛濛的時候，我們別了。</p>
<p>然而那一別，有的竟和我成了永別</p>
<p>也正是這個時候，也正是這個天，這個雨，這個湖面：而對着這情景的，則只有我一人了。想起那許多朋友，多少人已先他們的理想而喪亡：「要努力」，他們的話語還在耳邊：再想起自己年來的生活，走到他們昔日曾着足的舊十，竟使得我默注着湖面，許久許久都只是默然。面前的湖面·還是濛濛的，自己曾衝過多少濛濛？水面上可留着自己一些前進的水紋？想着，我只是默然！</p>
<p>自己明知許多朋友們都曾向那邊衝過，卽使結果不曾有過什麼效力，死了；然而那還是可欽佩的；比起苟活的，要强多少呢？於默默中，我又　到了些憤憤之情；「要努力」他們的話，我是永不會忘掉的。</p>
<p>憤憤還是難以壓住往事的。無論如何，我想起那頭髮蓬鬆的靑年，由入獄以至於死，當我蹈着他曾蹈過的地方時，在憤憤裏我還是不免要威傷的。靑年人的情感，就這樣的可貴，這樣的使人依戀。牠會燃起另一部靑年人的心火，同是靑年人·彼此相愛，相了解，就這樣容易，這樣眞摯，這樣深切。</p>
<p>對着這濛濛的湖面我將說些什麼呢？我還是只有默然。楊柳又吐出嫩芽，桃花默默地開，也默默地謝，大自然總是這樣輸迴的，在輸迴裏把一些捲走，又把一些帶來，總是這樣的；又如何容得你不走？是的，「要努力」，春雨給我帶來這個消息。紀念着先理想而喪亡的朋友，我將永不忘記他們的話。。</p>
<p>也正是沉沉的天，</p>
<p>也正是霏霏的雨，</p>
<p>也正是濛濛的湖面；</p>
<p>我說：沉沉的天是風雨之辰，</p>
<p>濛濛的湖面不見你孤帆的影，</p>
<p>霏菲的雨，就是霏霏的雨吧。</p>
<p>是的，雨打着桃花，也打着荒郊的墓，死了的死了，活着的呢？</p>
<p>難到霏霏的雨就是淚？</p>
<h3>「迷亡」</h3>
<p>— 淸泉作</p>
<h3>一週歲</h3>
<p>— 櫻之</p>
<p>孩子整整地一週歲了！隔晚臨睡時妻對我耳朶軟聲地說，</p>
<p>禮拜天，天亮開來的時候，就是這麼好的一個淸爽氣候！細風吹吻到臉頰上，一陣地威到軟貼貼地舒適。</p>
<p>側過頭，兒子在裏床張開了烏溜溜的眼瞳子注着我！復由向我做了一個最可愛的媚眼，抿一下嘴！</p>
<p>（他很感到長大成的一歲愉快的！）</p>
<p>我把妻推醒了，她說買些什麼東西給孩子當禮物哩。我肚子裏忖慢慢地邊把衣服穿着起來。</p>
<p>懷着一顆希罕的心，走出了家門。盤算着袋子裏的價值與欲購之貨物相符合否？</p>
<p>在一家公司裏看到一件很够歡喜的小童西裝，標價二元七角半，在店夥很有力地用有色包紙縛起來了，我得摸袋子裏的皮夾已是一些不可再遲緩的時侯了。</p>
<p>回出身來的時候，復又看到一頂極有禮貌的小水手帽亦向我行着眼熱的敬禮，十分親熱似的，巴望我亦帶牠一起回家去。</p>
<p>似乎這是最易轉變本來內心的一種誘惑！歸家時，我還是把牠挾在我的腋裏回來。</p>
<p>妻子替孩子很快地把衣服穿上身了，孩子用勁地拉着帽子的邊緣不放：妻子又像這麼快活地自個子說。</p>
<p>—這樣做，爸是很有意思的。</p>
<p>下午妻提議替孩子攝個照留紀念吧！又想到今天是兒子生日。一禮拜前母親提的信里，寫得很切實須在那天買對香燭請請菩薩的，於是又問我須要不要買這些東西。</p>
<p>我知道這還是她最慣會的一個調皮方法的反問，我借着母親的口氣把這件公案答允下了。</p>
<p>她說我們今天省買些小菜吧！我總於不好意思向她笑了。</p>
<p>在飯前在飯後，她不再提起攝照相這類話。</p>
<p>—兒子今天生日，不許再去打他或是隨便駡他呢。</p>
<p>洗碗的時候，不知怎樣她想起了這一句，又像叮嚀似的向我說。</p>
<p>—我們替兒子去攝個照吧！我爽直的替她說出了。</p>
<p>—你怎麼又記起了？她說，說了後却又仔細地看上我幾眼！好像又懷疑這句話不是當眞的。</p>
<p>我對她笑了笑，我把孩子抱起在手裏，她給于亦高興地笑起來了。</p>
<p>光華里攝了照出來，妻子顯出分外高興的神氣，兜個圈子回去吧！</p>
<p>霞飛路很快地踱了一個很長的來回妻靠着我的肩。</p>
<p>我們保佑兒子永遠可愛吧。</p>

<p>電影發達的歷史，亦和一個人在艱雖困苦中奮們一樣，經過了多少年的失敗和成功，到了一個安富尊榮的地位，但是到了那地位之後，反而覺得日中則昃，月盈則虧起來。但是電影經過了三十年的奮鬥，從「活動西洋景」變化成了一個偉大企業，是否亦將於登峯造極之後，就趨於沒落呢？從機械，財力，人各各方面說，電影到了那時，已經達到了極盛時代。但是自從極盛時代達到之後，電影的事業却就自始衰落了。影戲塲中，觀衆人數，已是寥寥可數。影業的鉅頭，都覺到電影的末日到了。</p>
<p>有人在那個時候說：「我們所需要的，是一個很好的革命。全部的電影事業，都要革新一下。不然，影業前途的命運，就很難挽教了」。許多人聽了他的話，祇可以置之一笑，不懂得他說的什麼話。恐怕連那說話的人，都不知道自己說的什麼話，因爲他亦不過在測想着，期待着罷了。但是他們不知道，正在那個時候，有幾個有心的人，正在密室中堆頭苦幹。他們在做什麼？否，來是在試　一件新發明，準備着要掀起影界的一個革命風波哩。他們這幾個人决定了，一二十年前幢幢來往的電影，要使它開口說起話來，唱起歌來！</p>
<p>這就是有聲電影的降生了！有聲電影降生的時候，大發明家艾迪生還沒有死。電影要能說話，本來就是艾迪生所懷想的。現在那個夢想，居然一旦完成了，艾迪生在第一次看見有聲電影的時候，不知道他有什感想哩。但以事實而論，艾迪生確乎沒有想到影片的本身，會發出聲音來。他所懷想的，不過要將留聲機，和電影機兩相連繫起來，便看電影的時候，同時可以聽得到留聲機中發出來的聲音而已。</p>
<p>這種「同床異夢」的有聲電影，我們在有聲電影的最初期，亦曾看到過。他們對白或唱歌，收入唱片之中，在搖影片的時候，同時用無綫電聲音放大機，將唱片上的對白歌唱放送出來。這種發明最大的一個毛病，就是大複雜，大笨重，並且銀幕上的動作，和唱片上句聲音，很難一致，而往往有參差前後之處。後來發明的有聲影片，是動作聲音一致的，因爲那是在影片本身上發音的。但那還是後來的事呢。</p>
<p>在現代有聲影片沒有發明之前，威廉福期（William　Fox）和他的總工程師吉斯（TheodorEU．Chase）首先公開試演他門的影片上附帶聲冓」的東西。那種聲冓，是和唱片上的聲冓是相仿的，不過前者是附着於影片上的，而後者是盤繞於　片上的而已同時華納兄弟公司亦發明了影片與唱片連繫的構造。但是當影業鉅頭，聽完了他們的發明的結果，都搖搖頭說：「這種東西還不够高明，不能拿出來給觀衆看哩」！</p>
<p>觀衆的程度已經提得多麼高！聲音粗糙不齊的東西，他們是不要看的。但是三十年以前，他們却大家看了那第一張活動影片，「火車鉅刦案」，而表示驚奇。那種影片在放映的時上下垂直的光綫閃　　，如同室內下雨一樣。一班演員表演的時候，一跳一跳活像一羣猴子。但是他們都喜歡看那種片子，而到了三十年以後的一九二六年，他們看見了粗糙的發聲影片，反而不願組以庽目。這可見觀衆程度增高，速度的可驚了。（未完）</p>
<h3>評「孤雛紅淚」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>——大上海映</p>
<p>Anne　of　Green　Gables</p>
<p>看了這孤雛紅淚」後，彷彿秋高氣爽的時候，在小溪之畔，對着白蘋紅寥，讀了一首淸　凄具的小詩。</p>
<p>原著者蒙高茂萊（L．M．Montgonery）這位小說家，從這「孤雛紅淚」的意境看來，他的世界觀　然是相當陳舊的。他寫：</p>
<p>孤女安痕十四歲時被一個哥哥（馬素）因少年對失戀就立意不娶，妹妹（瑪莉拉）也伴着他獨身到老的家庭領了去，在這兩位因生活不健全，性根就有點變態的老人身邊，過着興她那雖然孤苦，可是極活潑的性子不大合適的生活。因爲她是頭紅頭髪，被男同學加上了胡蘿　的渾號，她犯了校規，那嚴厲的老處女聞得對方吉爾勃是她哥哥的失戀入的兒子時，就不　罰她，可是待安痕愛了這少年吉爾勃時，却遭受了極厲害的干涉，甚至被迫和他斷絕往來，結果是　獨身的老繼父疾危了，安痕在吉爾勃處設法得名醫來救了他，這兩位老者才允許了他們的婚約。</p>
<p>這兒，原作者是想表現：下一代人的戀愛應該不因上一代人的戀愛之不幸而失去自由這一主題的。但是他並不曾從下一代人安痕與吉　勃身上去求發揮，積極地爭取得自己的戀　自由權，却被動地要老人因感着病的被救之恩，才肯允許。這一觀點是說明了作者的世界觀的。</p>
<p>影片「孤雛紅淚」，由於原著的充滿着自然的詩趣，與倫理的身世的情感；以及導演者喬治尼丘爾司（George　Nichoffg　Jr）的細膩與簡潔明快的手法，是做到了可觀的成果的。但也不是除了上面所指的世界觀之陳舊以外，就沒有劇本方面的缺憾的。首先是馬家的原欲向孤兒院領一男孩，却不料錯領了安痕這女童。至於爲什麼會錯，以及錯了怎麼不當時就換正，片中是沒有說明白。次之在第二天當瑪莉拉决計把安痕送回去換男孩時，院長怎麼會領着她把安痕送到　祿夫人家去做使女，而使瑪莉拉因不忍安痕受苦又把她再帶回來呢？這不但瑪莉拉對安痕愛與懀的心理轉變得太快，而且同往下家是沒有理由的。第三安痕雖因吉爾勃捉弄她，使她犯了校規，就此不理他：但當她知道吉爾勃家與馬家的關係時，她對他已存着絕大的好奇心，吉卽屢次向她表示悔過和愛慕，在這情形下是很可以使她和他言歸於好的。可是片中一定要似其他的影片中習見的戀愛過程一樣，使吉爾勃任她危險中救了命才博得她感恩地垂愛。這不但落了舊套，而且也大顯着是做作了。</p>
<p>導演的成功處首先在感情成份把握得濃厚。處處可以發笑，但這笑却又足以使人流淚的。第二是音響的操　得法，片中有好多處述用默片的特長，如：安痕在　祿夫人家中時得罪了班萊夫人要被趕走，馬素來設法留她時等等，都以靜寂的　面，沉重的綫條，獲得可貴的效果。至於光影的運用如安痰的孤凄雙影，老馬素的修長俏影，安痕向班萊夫人悔罪時的背景，都和同學少年游　時的亂光，Green　Gabie中的花影作了極好的比擬。</p>
<p>演技除了在「小婦人」中有着好成　的安娜秀蘭在這兒更是獲得了進展外，要算O．P．Heggle的老馬素最成功。古爾勃開始的演做太令人有壞胚子之感，共實他雖然有點頑皮，可不該給人以不大好的印象，這樣纔史能得到後來被迫失去自由時人們的　情。</p>
<h3>「塊肉餘生」中狄更斯的階級觀念</h3>
<p>— 佛雷</p>
<p>被稱爲十九世前半期的三大小說家之一的査爾，狄更斯（Charles　Diskens），是和許多小說家如左拉，斯蒂文生，高爾斯華綏等一樣地到現在成爲好萊塢影片製作家們所重視。這自然是同時說明了現在的好萊塢影片製作家們對於電影題材的枯竭，不得不從旣存的名著文學作品裏去找　題材，把許多文學名著來改攝電影。</p>
<p>於是狄更斯的「獄底餘生」「孤兒流浪記」旣製作於前，現在又有「塊肉餘生」在上海繼着開映了。</p>
<p>對於狄更斯文學生涯以及作品的評述，在這有限的篇幅裏是不可能的事，我只想簡單地把「塊肉餘生」談談，也許對於影片的觀者有可以供參考的地方。</p>
<p>我們對「塊肉餘生」中的犬衛，考伯菲　，從他的幼年時代以至於長大成人後的經歷，狄更斯不僅替我們創造了這麼一個可愛而奮鬥的人物，同時也就實寫了當時的中等階級以及貧民，他們的生活與道德觀念。在這部「塊肉餘生」中的大衛的友好米考白，常是給經濟困難以及債主所煩擾的樂觀者，差不多也就是他父親的縮影，他父親也就給債務所逼而關進牢監，母親把家具變買來維持生活的。此外的許多人物也差不多是他童年時代所遇見過的。在這部小說中可以稱做上流階級的人物，恐怕只有司梯爾福斯一人，然而作者怎麼描寫他的呢？他誘騙了漢姆的未婚妻，後來把她遺棄，而終於在海裏淹死。在這裏，狄更斯對於上流階級是沒有抱着什麼好感的：雖然沒有更猛的攻擊，但　刺是够深刻的了。</p>
<p>「塊肉餘生」的整個故事，是極其平易而動人的，這裏面充滿着親熱與友愛。老漁璧各得，他的尋找愛密柳，以及漢姆跳入海中去救他的情敵，這些描寫都非常感情的。</p>
<p>以導演「小婦人」成功的佐治古高氏來支配這倘同樣洋溢着感情的故事，在成績上　有相當的把握；演員如沃莎　文，里昂巴里穆亞，奧梨芙等都是影迷們熟悉而愛好的角色，他們的演技，將會在這樣一位有經騐的導演底指導下可能得到完滿的發展是無疑的。</p>

<h3>業餘記者（After　Offiecew　Hours)　（一）</h3>
<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>美國米高梅出品　克拉克蓋博　康斯登本湼主演</p>
<p>一輛大汽車，行走得聲息全無的，在那家紐約新聞記載報館的門口停了下來。那滿身戎裝的汽車夫，立即跳了下來，走過去　着汽車的門。門一開，一位嬝嬝婷婷的女郎走了由來。那就是雪倫那各脫。她那苗條的身材，站在水門汀的路旁，風吹着衣襟，眞有飄飄欲仙之概。她看着她手腕上白金嵌鑽的手表，說了一聲：「六點半來，」就走進了那所高大的報館門。</p>
<p>在那報館之內，一扇玻璃門上寫「總編輯　」四個字。裏面放着一張大大的　本寫字　。坐在寫字檯上的人，正在將手指梳着自己的頭髮。他年紀很輕，頭髪黑黑的，微微的有些　曲。他年紀雖輕，但對於新聞的門檻，却是遊戲三昧，無所不知的了。因爲他知道得多，所以對於一些知識淺薄些的人，未免就有些不耐煩起來。</p>
<p>現在這位總編輯，傑姆勃郎却，正和一位攝影記者談着話。那位攝影記者巴兩，是自以爲當行出色的一等攝影記者了。傑姆手裏拿了好幾張照片，縐着眉審視了半天，問他這些都是什麼？巴爾興高彩烈地告訴他，那些都是柏德森案中的全部照片了。他說他費了整整三天三夜的功夫，才拍到的呢。</p>
<p>柏德森案子，不錯的，現在已經閑得滿城風雨了。一個大財主，一個如花似玉的夫人，還有一個美男子供給着一位富室嬌妻追求的對象。但是這些都是什麽？謠言，或事實？傑姆對着巴爾道：「故事呢？」巴爾給他一間，不覺楞着道：「故事？我怎麼知道那些事呢？」傑姆聽了，不覺搖着頭道：３紐約全島都在街談巷議着柏德森的事，　他和他的老婆……還有那個彭尼斯德，難道我們這們大的報館，一些真實的消息都找不出來？那末我們要這些相片做什麽？配鏡框子掛起來嗎？我們一定要想法子了！不管多困難！我不知道怎樣去找，但是我知道一定找得到的！」</p>
<p>他一面說，一面將拳頭錘着桌子。忽然他看見紙堆上，放着一個新聞稿子，上面僅著着「恩，愛斯」兩個字母，傑姆拿起來一看，原來是一篇音樂談評，但是他讀了三行，已經覺得格格不入，槽到萬份了。他不覺奇怪道：一嘿……誰寫的？誰是恩愛斯」。巴爾道：「她是一位此交之花。來了不過一個　　。總經理的太太薦她來的。」傑姆道：「嘿，社交之花？叫她來，我要見她。」</p>
<p>巴爾答　着退了出去。他臨走將門關上了。等到門再開的時候，剛才從汽車裏走出來的那位嬝嬝婷婷的女郞，已經　姍地走到傑姆的面前。傑姆不覺自己一顆心，勃勃地跳了起來。這位女郎，這種裝束簡直是他生平所沒有看見過。她那靜穆的態度，却使一個老練的總編輯心神不安起來了。但他還故意裝作不客氣的態度問道：一你是誰？」那方面却坦然的道：「你自己　我來的。你不是要見我嗎？」她說着微微的笑了一笑。傑姆於是點着頭道：「哦，原來你就是恩愛斯」。（未完）</p>

<h3>Investigation of the Tian Songyao Case: Chairman Chiang's Personal Order; Deputy Commander Sun Zhen Receives a Major Demerit; Ordered to Temporarily Lead the 29th Army to Expiate His Crime</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang issued a personal order to the military leaders of Sichuan on the 2nd, saying: (Official Title) The Jialing River has always been known as a strategic location. The area around Yuecang and Nanbu was originally the defense area of the 29th Army. For the past year, orders have been repeatedly issued to construct bunkers, strengthen fortifications, and deploy troops tightly to contain the intrusion of the remaining Xu bandits. This has been reiterated multiple times. The army is responsible for guarding the area and has consumed a significant amount of military spending over the years. Furthermore, in the name of saving the country and educating the local communities, how should military morale be boosted and efforts be made to repay the nation? However, according to reports last month, the army's defense was not strict, and a portion of the Xu bandits suddenly crossed the Jialing River on the evening of the 28th. Subsequently, due to ineffective combat, Cangxi, Langzhong, and Nanbu were also successively evacuated, abandoning the defense lines and plunging the people into misery. This is considered a neglect of orders and a harm to the local area, which cannot be tolerated any further. Therefore, Tian Songyao, the Bandit Suppression Supervisor of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Area, the Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Route, the Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Route of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Army, and the Commander of the 29th Army, is hereby dismissed from his post for investigation. His Deputy Commander, Sun Zhen, is given a major demerit for ineffective assistance. Sun Zhen is ordered to temporarily lead the 29th Army to expiate his crime. The generals responsible for the army's failure this time will be investigated and reported by Sun Zhen for separate punishment. The army has now gathered some troops. Sun Zhen is ordered to quickly reorganize and re-establish the army, following the instructions of General Commander Liu Xiang and reporting back. You are ordered to relay this information to all concerned. Personal order from Chiang Chung-cheng. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

They then infiltrated Xiaotouzhuang, Quanshui Tou, and Xinzhuangzi, setting fire to houses and killing people.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Meets with Yin Tao to Discuss the Rotation of Security Teams; Yin Tao is Scheduled to Inspect Caicun this Morning; Zhou Yuying's Troops in Yutian will not be Temporarily Transferred</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tongding left Tianjin at 10:20 PM on the 4th to travel south and then to Mount Moyu to see Huang Rupili before noon. Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and Tao Shangming discussed the eastern rotation of the security team in the war zone and went to the provincial government to meet Yu Xuezhong and talk for a long time. Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming, because the Japanese military staff officer Damu in Tianjin was busy with something, changed to take a car to Caicun on the morning of the 5th to inspect the new security team (4th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly compiled security team in the war zone is scheduled to start moving before the 15th of this month. Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming are scheduled to inspect Caicun this morning and Cangzhou on the 5th. On the 6th, they will return to Beiping and Tangshan to schedule the rotation of the new and old security teams. Except for Zhou Yuying's troops, which are currently in Yutian and responsible for bandit suppression, the rest of the old security team will be withdrawn from the war zone for reorganization or returned to their original formations. Liu Zuozhou, the commander of the Yu District Security Team, arrived in Ping from Tianjin with Zhu Shiqin last night and visited He this morning to report something and ask for instructions on the future rotation of the new and old security teams. Liu is scheduled to return to Tangshan tonight. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Zuozhou, the commander of the First Security Team in the war zone, took a train to Ping on the night of the 3rd to visit He Yingqin and report on the situation of his troops. Zhao Lei, the commander of the Second Security Team in the war zone, also went to Ping on the night of the 4th and also planned to visit General He to report. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong talked about the issue of clearing the war zone. After negotiations by various committees recently, some progress has been made. The new security team can definitely enter the war zone for rotation before the 15th of this month. The provincial government stipulates that the two units of Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yan will still be organized according to the system of two district teams and three battalions under each team, with 2,500 people in each total team. Originally, 8,000 people were trained. The 4,000 who cannot go east will still be stationed in Caicun, Cangxian, for training as future rotation supplements. Feng Shoupeng's troops are still part of Li Yunsheng's troops. The number of officers and soldiers in that total team, stipulated to be several thousand, will definitely not be changed. The date for the provincial government's relocation to Baoding has not been determined. Joint office work will be implemented after the relocation. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin from Jinan at 7:00 AM on the 4th. According to him, his most important responsibility during his 40-day trip to the south was to report on the internal affairs of the war zone and the Yellow River project. The atmosphere in Beijing is energetic, and the working conditions of various agencies are more tense than what he saw last year. He visited the most in Qingdao, which has developed more畸形 (Jixing - abnormally/deformedly) than other cities. Only Qingdao has everything in order and well-managed. Social undertakings are progressing evenly. Unnecessary things are not done. The construction of various rural villages in the city is also able to provide sufficient food and clothing, and the statistics of various affairs are particularly detailed and the numbers are accurate. The household registration is also very well-managed. Jinan has newly built two yarn factories, each with over 10,000 yarn bobbins, which is quite large in scale. The workers are disciplined and there are no idle machines or redundant workers. Production is adapted to consumption. Regarding the Yellow River project, the central government has decided to allocate funds and assign responsibilities separately. The Guantai dyke breach will be dealt with first. The blame for the past will be determined and dealt with in the future. The central government is extremely concerned about blocking the breach and disaster relief. After returning to the province, I will supervise and urge the Construction Department and the River Bureau to work hard to take responsibility in order to meet the expectations of the central government.

<h3>Promoting Attention to the Issue of Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Recently, in order to promote compulsory education and increase the efficiency of literacy among the masses, the Ministry of Education has adopted the opinion of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee and will earnestly promote phonetic symbols, stipulating that primary school textbooks and children's and mass reading materials must all be printed using phonetic Chinese characters. This move is truly an important facility worth noting in the field of educational administration since the Chinese Restoration. It is a grand event that should be written about in the cultural history books.</p>
<p>Everyone with a little common sense can say that Chinese characters are not as convenient to use as Western characters, and the movement to improve Chinese characters has already had a history of thirty or forty years. The tool for its improvement, the so-called "phonetic alphabet" or "phonetic symbols," has also been promoted by government decree again and again. However, in practice, it has always been carried on in the old ways and no obvious results have been seen. The reason for this is that those in charge have not been able to detail the steps, and those with power have not been able to implement it effectively. Now, the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee has observed the reasons why the previous efforts did not produce obvious results and has vigorously refuted the opposing reasons that hinder the promotion. It advocates that the Chinese character phonetic copper molds should be cast by the state for promotion, and requests that the authorities first start with those directly within the reach of administrative power. The Ministry of Education has approved the request and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for a meeting to approve the allocation of 20,000 yuan to entrust the Zhonghua Book Company to cast the copper molds on its behalf. It is rumored that it will be officially ordered that from a certain year and month, primary school textbooks and children's and mass reading materials must all be printed using phonetic Chinese characters. Those that have not been phoneticized originally will gradually be abolished within a certain period. Following this method, the movement to improve Chinese characters can gradually enter a better state.</p>
<p>However, since the news has spread, there seem to be quite a few people who oppose this proposal. The reasons they hold are nothing more than saying that Chinese characters are redundant in form when placed side by side with phonetic symbols, and that actual teaching is also inconvenient. However, I believe that, in terms of the general order of development of writing, after passing from ideographic writing to phonetic writing, one should break away from the shackles of phonetic symbols and create a kind of regular phonetic writing. When the change of Chinese characters should have advanced to the phonetic writing stage, it went astray due to the influence of the social environment, so that it could not take another step to become phonetic writing. The phonetic symbols of today are to enable Chinese characters to be led out of this wrong path and return to the ladder of the general evolutionary track of writing. Since it is called phonetic symbols, its purpose is primarily to indicate pronunciation, so it is certainly appropriate to be placed side by side with Chinese characters. The redundancy in form is indeed unavoidable, but when weighing the lesser of two evils, choose the lesser; when weighing the greater of two benefits, choose the greater. If phonetic Chinese characters are indeed of great benefit to increasing the literacy efficiency of the masses, then the redundancy in form will naturally have to be disregarded. As for the inconvenience of teaching, etc., at the beginning of the promotion, those who are literate but have not learned phonetic symbols will naturally feel inconvenience, which is undeniable. However, once the environment is created and habits are formed, both the teacher and the student will not feel any convenience or inconvenience. Observing the Chinese-Western combined documents that are popular in commercial ports and the Chinese-English bilingual publications that are beneficial to learning English or Chinese, one can know that placing phonetic symbols side by side with Chinese characters is not only not necessarily inconvenient for beginners, but may even increase their effectiveness of self-study. Therefore, if phonetic Chinese characters can be effectively promoted, after a considerable period of time, such opposing arguments will not be difficult to gradually subside.</p>
<p>Regarding the method of promotion, according to the original proposal of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, the phonetic copper molds should be cast and promoted by the state. Now the Ministry of Education has decided to allocate funds to entrust the book company to do it on its behalf. This may be because the funds are tight and it is necessary to resort to commercial institutions. In fact, improving writing to increase the literacy effect of the general public is politically no less significant than the construction of aviation and highways. If the government wants to actively promote phonetic symbols to thoroughly implement the goal of reforming writing, it should generously raise funds to achieve it in order to be effective. In short, the Ministry of Education's ability to resolutely adopt the opinions of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee is commendable. However, regarding the raising of funds, I hope that the gentlemen of the government will also pay considerable attention to it.</p>

<h3>British Upper House Debates Far East Situation: Rejects Mediation Proposal, British Undersecretary Details Reasons for Disapproval, Saying Mediation Would Arouse Suspicions of Involved Nations</h3>
<p>(London) British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Stanhope, today, during a debate on the Far East situation in the Upper House, rejected the suggestion that Britain should mediate between China and Japan. This debate was initiated by Lord Peel, who served as Lord Privy Seal in 1931. Peel proposed that the government pay attention to the new situation in the Far East after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and China's loss of its seat on the League's Executive Council, stating that these events have weakened the ties between the East and Europe. He did not endorse the view of animosity towards Japan, believing that the critical remarks made by some against Japan have caused considerable harm. Britain has a long and close relationship in the Far East and should closely study the current situation both in terms of rights and obligations, and, as a friend familiar with the situation, offer sincere advice to both China and Japan.</p>
<p>The statements made by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota have greatly increased the anxieties of China and the outside world regarding Japan's desire to dominate China. The current situation is full of suspicion, which is not only not diminishing but is gradually intensifying. What is Japan's purpose? This is the question. Japan clearly wants to have the advantage of having its say in any plans of the Western powers regarding China. As for Japan's need for expansion and its desire for more markets and raw materials, these are what we cannot but acknowledge. Speaking of possible remedies, the most obvious is to convene a conference of the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, this move would offend Japan and only worsen the situation. Britain should, in the most appropriate way, offer its services as a mediator, but with the understanding that Britain wants to know how things are progressing internally and to assist with the sole intention of establishing peace and trust. This is a good year for Britain to offer its services, as this year can be called</p>
<p>the Chinese Year.</p>
<p>The Chinese opera "The Colorful Building" has been successful in Britain, and the Chinese Painting Exhibition at Burlington House, along with the visit of four hundred Chinese students to Britain, should bring back an impression of British friendship. We should find ways to reconcile China and Japan without arousing the suspicions and animosity of other countries, he said. Conservative Party's Lord Newton, who recently traveled to the Far East, advocated considering Japan's position, saying that China and Japan are currently in negotiations, and, as far as he knows personally, these negotiations should have a satisfactory conclusion because Japan is prepared to pay a large sum of money to China regarding certain measures concerning customs duties. The concern that Japan intends to annex China is nothing short of neurotic; Japan cannot take such action financially or otherwise. Britain should do its utmost to facilitate an agreement between China and Japan without involving the League of Nations. If a crusade is launched against Japan, it will inevitably lead to a war between the white and Asian nations, resulting in the destruction of all that the white nations possess in the East, he said. Conservative Party's Lord Atholl, following Newton, said that the best approach is to allow Japan to occupy Manchuria. Japan has paid a considerable price in money and blood for Manchuria, and China can thereby gain an opportunity to unite itself. Earl of Glasgow spoke of the China-Burma Boundary Commission and asked when it could proceed with its work. Conservative Party's Lord Lamington said that Britain, the United States, and Japan should at this time establish an agreement regarding the Pacific. Lord Barnby (the leader of the British industrial delegation that visited Japan and "Manchukuo" last year) said that the claim that Japan is expanding its aggression is inaccurate. Financial considerations should come first. Considering Japan's many constraints, it is highly unlikely that Japan intends to annex a large part of China. China must understand the necessity of relying on Britain and</p>
<p>cooperating with Japan.</p>
<p>If China and Japan cooperate, then Britain can also be expected to cooperate and will also urge the United States to join in cooperation. No one, except for the rabid politicians in the San Francisco area, believes that there is a fundamental conflict between the United States and Japan. Anyone with a modicum of vision knows that Japan may not change its current position. Chinese public opinion is now gradually shifting towards a better understanding of Japan, he said. Conservative Party's Lord Eddisbury (who previously served as custodian of enemy property in China) followed, saying that Chinese and Japanese interests do not necessarily conflict, but the fact of the rupture between the two sides creates a dangerous situation. Other countries should find ways to mediate. Britain is best suited to be a mediator and should be determined to do so. The major problem that should be addressed immediately is the danger of economic collapse in China. If it is not rescued soon, a great disaster will occur that cannot be undone. Britain will then encounter the accomplished fact of an Asian Monroe Doctrine, he said. Lord Rochester also expressed his views, saying that the Far East problem can be resolved with patience and wisdom. The root of the problem lies in Japan's taking unilateral actions without consulting the signatory nations of the Washington Treaty. We must restore the principles of the Washington Treaty. Open discussions among the powers concerned are the only solution, he said. Lord Marley (former Undersecretary of State for War, who visited Shanghai in 1932 as the initiator of the Anti-War Congress) claimed that taking a purely</p>
<p>anti-Japanese attitude</p>
<p>is an unrealistic move. Unless Japan begins its continental policy, other countries are not prepared to address the issue of entrusting all their special interests to Japan. Sacrifices on the part of other countries are necessary. Japan now has a different kind of development. There is now the possibility of creating a Mongol Empire. This point should be carefully observed. If we do not give it a sympathetic observation and judge to what extent we can help its development, we will never achieve a satisfactory solution. The Labour Party is willing to support full discussions among the countries concerned, including the Soviet Union. Such a conference must clearly state that the countries concerned will never allow the Chinese people to continue to be dominated by others, he said. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Stanhope, responded on behalf of the government, saying that the claim that China's finances are about to collapse is far from the truth. China recently inquired whether Britain could help it with a loan. The British government considered the proposal sympathetically and carefully but decided that such a plan would only have a temporary effect and would not truly benefit China. Britain has consulted with other countries that have a very close relationship with the Far East and informed them of Britain's actions. After the Chinese Committee for the Study of the General Situation submits its report, Britain and other countries will give it the most sympathetic consideration. Considering the current financial situation of Japan, he does not believe that Japan is prepared to lend a large sum of money to China in exchange for various special interests. As for the claim that Britain should be a mediator, he does not approve of mediation because mediators are often understood to be interfering in disputes, and the disputing parties often unite to oppose the mediator. This is not a position that Britain wants to take. Whether convening a conference would be beneficial at present is also questionable.</p>
<p>The correct policy</p>
<p>is to continue what we are doing now without making a big fuss. We are willing to promote closer relations with countries that have a diligent former relationship with the Far East. We welcome closer relations between Japan and Russia. Regarding the talks between China and Japan, we have made it clear to both sides that if we can provide any assistance to alleviate their difficulties or facilitate their understanding, we are willing to do so gladly. Chinese and Japanese authorities know that we now hold the view that reconciliation between China and Japan is beneficial to both sides and also to the whole world. As for the demarcation of the border with Burma, he knows that notes will be exchanged within a few days to establish a demarcation committee, he said. The debate ended here.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry's Attitude: No Third-Party Interference Allowed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news reports, the British Upper House discussed the China problem in great detail on the afternoon of the 3rd. The Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed the following views on this news: It is difficult to understand what the British Upper House members mean by discussing the British government's mediation of relations between China and Japan. The relationship between China and Japan will never allow interference from the British government. The British government's interference in Sino-Japanese relations will only intensify the internal strife in China and will be of no benefit. We deeply hope that the British government will take a fair and appropriate view of this issue. (Jiji Press telegram from the 4th)</p>
<h3>French Minister of Commerce To Depart for Beijing</h3>

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses European Situation: Main Tendency of Foreign Policy, No Commitment to Eastern European Pact, Continues Mediation Mission in Stresa Conference</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a routine meeting today to discuss the current diplomatic situation based on information obtained by British ministers from Berlin, Moscow, and Warsaw. According to informed sources, the main tendencies of British foreign policy are roughly as follows: (1) Regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, Britain will not take any commitments on the Eastern European side. The security of Eastern European countries should be resolved by the countries concerned themselves. It is not impossible for the countries concerned to conclude a European pact, including clauses stipulating the "definition of an aggressor," but Britain will not participate in such "definition of an aggressor" clauses. However, Britain will continue to provide moral support for various collective security initiatives. (2) Britain will continue to mediate between Czechoslovakia and other powers at the Stresa conference to ease the European situation. Since Britain regards itself as a mediator at the Stresa conference, it can create a situation to indirectly compel Germany to participate in collective security organizations. Britain cannot support the great powers' negotiations of various agreements without regard to Czechoslovakia and without exchanging information with Germany. Britain believes that it is essential to avoid giving Germany the impression that Germany has been thrown out of European coordination. It is essential to make Germany deeply believe that the great powers have no intention of excluding Czechoslovakia, so that the opportunity for negotiations can be used at any time to allow Germany to participate in all the peaceful efforts of other countries. For this reason, the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" recently advocated that the Stresa conference should decide on a common action program to cope with certain future events. Britain is not in a position to approve of this proposal. (3) The British diplomatic community hopes that Britain, France, and Italy will jointly negotiate a declaration to be submitted to the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council on April 15, so that the Executive Council can accept the declaration without further discussion. This declaration should reiterate the attitude taken by the great powers regarding Germany's announcement of the abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, but at the same time, the door should remain open to continue negotiations with Germany. In addition, a clause may be included in the declaration stipulating that countries should consult each other when it is necessary to take collective action to maintain peace. The above is the general tendency of British foreign policy, but this tendency is by no means immutable. So far, it is still exploratory. Whether it will succeed depends on the attitude of the countries concerned. (Havas telegram from the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet will meet on Friday to hear reports from Lord Privy Seal Eden's visits to Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague. Next week, Foreign Secretary Simon and Eden will go to Stresa, but Prime Minister MacDonald may not attend the tripartite conference. Political circles do not expect the Stresa conference to produce significant results, but they attach importance to the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council to be convened on April 15. (Guomin News Agency telegram from the 4th)</p>
<p>Mussolini Puts Forward Plan</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will put forward a plan at the Stresa conference. Mussolini believes that before attempting to conclude various mutual assistance pacts, it is necessary to first create the strongest possible feeling to enable countries to trust each other. Therefore, Mussolini may put forward a declaration to be signed jointly by European countries, with a suggestion attached to reopen economic and political negotiations to improve the relations between countries. This plan will be based on last year's Italian-Austrian-Hungarian agreement, which stipulates that countries should consult each other on all issues concerning the overall European situation, and a conference of the countries concerned may be convened at the request of a signatory country. The purpose of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian agreement was to stipulate a common policy to improve the political and economic relations of the Danube countries. Now Mussolini's plan is to expand the scope of this agreement to promote it to all European countries. (Havas telegram from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval is now scheduled to depart for Stresa, Italy, on the evening of the 10th of this month to attend the British-French-Italian conference. Many important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, such as Secretary-General Léger, will accompany Laval. (Havas telegram from the 3rd)</p>
<p>French Side Intends to Revise the Pact</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources, French officials today plan to revise the proposed Eastern European Pact to allow Poland to participate. The origin of the French plan is due to Poland's refusal to participate in the pact in its current form. It is generally hoped that Germany may also be able to approve of it after the revision. At the same time, France has launched a major plan to build aircraft. The Senate has approved the expansion of the Air Force. By the end of 1935, the strength of the French Air Force will be so great that Germany will not be able to catch up in the short term. In terms of diplomacy, France still intends to conclude military defense agreements with the Soviet Union and other countries. It is said that Czechoslovakia may also participate, but this depends on whether the tripartite conference convened by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can agree on a broader security pact. Generally speaking, France will have concrete suggestions for the pact to deal with the opposition of Polish Minister of Military Affairs Marshal Piłsudski. The content of the suggestions will probably bring the Eastern European countries into a more direct relationship with the League of Nations, rather than engaging exclusively in purely military alliances. As for whether the Italian conference will invite Eastern European countries to participate together, diplomatic circles are still discussing it. (Guomin News Agency telegram from the 4th)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Observe as a Failure</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers commented on the talks between Britain and Poland in Warsaw, most of which believed that the results did not produce any new developments. However, some newspapers still hoped that Poland would change its mind. "Le Petit Parisien" said that the news of French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Poland was greatly appreciated in Warsaw. This should be given great attention. It also said, "When Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski spoke with British Lord Privy Seal Eden, they did not explicitly reject the Eastern European Pact." "Le Petit Journal" carried an article by Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Tessan, saying, "Foreign Minister Laval's trip to Warsaw may make Poland no longer hold an ambiguous attitude. This will benefit Poland itself and the future of peace in Europe." In addition, "Le Petit Journal" also stated that Eden's trip to Moscow was declared a success, while the trip to Warsaw ended in failure. Colonel Beck could have chosen between the pro-French or pro-German camps, but unfortunately, he had already made a choice. His choice may not run counter to the Franco-Polish alliance."

<h3>Eden and Czech Foreign Minister Meet: Consistent Policy to Safeguard Peace</h3>
<p>(London) Eden will arrive in the Czech capital of Prague at 8:00 AM today to meet with Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Beneš. According to the scheduled agenda, Eden will meet and have lunch with the doctor, and then plan to return to London by plane. At the same time, according to opinions from well-informed circles, Eden's visit to Warsaw has indeed had an effect. Although Poland has stated the difficulty of agreeing to the Eastern European Pact, this trip cannot be said to be without benefit. Experts traveling with Eden seem to firmly advocate that Britain should bear part of the responsibility for maintaining peace in Europe. The Cabinet will consider Eden's report on his visits to various countries at a meeting on Friday. Today, it was learned that Foreign Secretary Simon and Eden have been selected to participate in the Stresa Conference. They will depart early next week. Prime Minister MacDonald does not seem likely to attend. According to Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Stanhope, who declared in the Upper House last night, the government still believes that a convention on limiting or reducing armaments is likely to be achieved, but acknowledges that the scope of such a convention must be narrow, probably only limiting the caliber of certain guns and the tonnage of certain tanks. (Reuters telegram from the 4th)</p>
<p>The Czech capital welcomed British Lord Privy Seal Eden and his entourage this morning. He immediately held talks with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. After the first round of talks, a communiqué was issued stating that the two governments are in complete agreement on the goals and policies of safeguarding general peace and that the two governments have expressed their unwavering adherence to the policy of the League of Nations.

<h3>Austrian Cabinet Issues Communiqué: Imitates Germany in Reorganizing Armaments, Says Necessary Preparations Have Begun, Part of France's Encirclement Plan</h3>
<p>The Vienna government today issued a communiqué declaring that Austria is prepared to imitate Germany in abolishing the armaments restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles, and in concise terms stated, "The necessary preparations have already begun." It is said that Austria is currently the only country in Europe without a military organization, while its neighbors have all made efforts to expand their armaments. Observers say that the diplomatic side has notified France and has sought France's consent. Chancellor Schuschnigg's government is very friendly to France and has made every effort to prevent union with Germany. Therefore, its armaments reorganization plan may also be implemented on this basis. It is understood that Austria's plan is also part of France's encirclement of Germany and may participate in the proposed mutual defense pact within a possible range. The commanders of the Austrian army's reserve forces have been ordered to report, probably for the purpose of mobilizing new troops. (Guomin News Agency telegram from the 4th)</p>
<p>Vienna After a cabinet meeting last night, a statement was issued saying that the Austrian government has decided to ask the great powers to allow the reintroduction of compulsory military service. This move was prohibited by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Austrian leaders clearly want to avoid causing condemnation and possible consequences by unilaterally denying the treaty. They may fear that the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente will follow the example of other former enemy countries and introduce compulsory military service, and the threat that the countries will immediately mobilize to deal with it will be realized. The communiqué said, "The cabinet meeting today, chaired by Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg, discussed the issue of expanding the Austrian army. Cabinet members were unanimous in their opinion that allowing Austria to have full equality is a self-evident assumption. Therefore, necessary preparatory steps will be taken now." Vice Chancellor and Commander of the Home Guard Starhemberg did not attend this meeting, which is noteworthy. According to informed political figures, the Austrian government now intends to increase the army by 60,000 men by using selective conscription in the auxiliary forces. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, universal conscription should be abolished. The Austrian army, including officers and headquarters troops, is limited to 30,000 men. The Austrian government is now trying to ask the great powers to revise the treaty. (Reuters telegram from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Vienna According to observations from powerful sources, Austria's announcement of the abolition of the armaments clause of the Treaty of Versailles must have reached some kind of diplomatic understanding with France. The Austrian government, led by Schuschnigg, has a very strong pro-French color, and France is most concerned about its connection with Nazi Germany. Therefore, based on the above, Austria's armaments revival is realized. (Dentsu telegram from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia Expresses No Surprise</h3>
<p>Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, The Czech government and public did not express surprise at the Austrian government's announcement of the equality of armaments rights. The foreign ministers of the Little Entente had already considered this at the meeting in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, and Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. The Little Entente believes that the right to equality of armaments should be reviewed by the Executive Council of the League of Nations, but unilateral action to adopt any position is resolutely opposed by the Little Entente.

<h3>Strength of the German Air Force: British Public Opinion Expresses Surprise</h3>
<p>(London) Czechoslovakia's air force is on par with that of Britain. This was personally informed to British ministers by German Chancellor Hitler. Foreign Secretary Simon admitted this in the House of Commons yesterday. British public opinion was very surprised to hear this. The Daily Mail commented, "Germany is proceeding step by step according to the predetermined timetable. Those who condemn Czechoslovakia for setting up an air force are ignored by Germany. When the air force is ready, it is publicly announced, and the maintainers of the Treaty of Versailles are told, 'The German air force has now been established. What will you do?'" The Daily News said, "The period of secret concealment has now passed. Since Hitler has admitted that the German air force is equal to that of Britain, we have every reason to assume that the country's air force strength is not only on par with that of Britain. Given the rapid development of the German air force, there is no doubt that it will surpass Britain," and so on. (Havas telegram from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a message from the "L'Écho de Paris" today, the secret memorandum written by British Foreign Secretary Simon summarizing his recent talks with German leader Hitler is now in the possession of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This document has made a very deep impression on the French Cabinet. This document is related to the remarks made by French Premier Flandin on Tuesday, when the French Premier said that the French government is now considering increasing the number of active-duty soldiers.

<h3>British-Polish Commercial Treaty Concluded: Increase in Poland's Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>Warsaw correspondence The commercial treaty between Britain and Poland has been formally signed after repeated negotiations. According to the provisions of the treaty, the treaty will take effect on December 31 of this year. The Polish press and the relevant industrial and commercial circles are paying close attention to this. The Polish people unanimously recognize that the conclusion of this commercial treaty is closely related to the revision of other commercial treaties recently due to the implementation of Poland's new tax rate. Because Britain is still the largest buyer of Polish goods, and Poland is also beneficial to the exchange of goods between Britain and Poland, it is generally hoped that after the conclusion of this new treaty, trade between Britain and Poland can be further developed and both sides can benefit. All private commercial treaties previously concluded between Britain and Poland, such as coal agreements, will be important data for this commercial treaty. Poland's foreign trade, which has the largest surplus, is mainly with Britain, with a surplus of 105,700,000 Polish zlotys last year. The largest deficit is mainly with Switzerland, followed by France. In overseas trade, the United States has a surplus of 98,000,000 Polish zlotys with Poland, but Poland has a surplus in overseas trade with China, French South Africa, Palestine, and other countries. According to recent statistics, the total value of Poland's foreign trade exports in January of this year was 79,291,000 Polish zlotys, and the total value of imports was 61,938,000 Polish zlotys, with a total surplus of 16,353,000 Polish zlotys, an increase of 953,000 Polish zlotys compared to the surplus in the same month last year. It is expected that after the implementation of the British-Polish commercial treaty and other revised commercial treaties, the surplus will be even more considerable. The most important of Poland's export goods are wheat, rye, barley, oats, sugar beet, wheat flour, rye flour, hops, cattle, pigs, butter, feathers, and down, pig bristles, petroleum, zinc, fur, pure wool, and wool textiles, flax, and flax silk, timber (mostly railway sleepers), plywood, wood panels, bentwood furniture, pig iron, railway steel pipes and water pipes, etc.</p>

<h3>U.S. Fleet to Hold Exercises in the Pacific Starting May 3rd; Commander of U.S. Asiatic Fleet to Visit Japan to Explain; Exercise Plan to Form a Large Triangular Formation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the U.S. fleet is scheduled to begin exercises in the Pacific on May 3rd. To dispel any ill feelings in Japan arising from this, the commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will visit Yokohama on that day as a friendly gesture. Swanson stated to reporters his personal opinion that future naval conferences should include Germany, but he has not received any submission from Germany regarding this matter. Sweden's intention to have a navy of 450,000 tons will not affect the 5:5:3 ratio in the U.S., Britain, and Japan's case. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Fearing that the fleet exercises in the Pacific will arouse suspicion in Japan regarding any war intentions, the U.S. will send two batches of goodwill envoys to Japan to explain. The first batch is Admiral Hepburn, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, who will arrive in Yokohama on May 3rd, the date the exercises begin, aboard the flagship Augusta. Afterwards, a squadron of destroyers from the Asiatic Fleet will visit Kobe. This demonstration of goodwill was announced today by Secretary of the Navy Swanson. Prior to this, the naval department had received multiple telegrams opposing the exercises, calling them a demonstration of force against Japan. Swanson stated that this accusation is unfounded because the U.S. fleet exercises will be 2,000 miles from the Japanese coast, and this move was announced a year ago, when the fleet had not yet sailed to the Atlantic. Therefore, the current plan cannot be seen as a result of Japan's withdrawal from the Washington Naval Treaty. Several religious groups, such as the Christian Church and the National Association, have strongly opposed the exercises. Swanson's statement today is the first time the Navy Department has stated its position. The U.S. fleet's exercise plan will form a large triangle between San Diego, Dutch Harbor, and the Hawaiian Islands. Whether the fleet will go to the Philippines has not yet been announced, but it is said that this year's exercise does not include this plan. (National Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Mission Arrives in Tokyo Last Night</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The U.S.-China Economic Mission, led by former Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Forbes, a group of twelve members, arrived in Yokohama at 7:00 PM on the fourth, aboard the President Coolidge. Those who greeted them at the pier included Mr. Muto Jukuro, Chairman of the Japan-U.S. Trade Council, and many other prominent figures from various circles. The group immediately transferred to cars and went to Tokyo, arriving safely at Tokyo Station at 8:00 PM and lodging at the Imperial Hotel. (Japan United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>New Elections in Danzig After the Saar Vote; National Socialist Party Hopes to Win a Two-Thirds Majority; Hitler's Representative Delivers Fiery Speech</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Danzig, which has the status of a free city under the Treaty of Versailles, will hold new parliamentary elections. Prominent members of the National Socialist Party have arrived there to participate in this event, causing widespread anxiety. The vote is scheduled for Sunday. The National Socialist Party hopes to win a two-thirds majority so that it can petition the League of Nations to amend the city's constitution. Those who arrived there today to participate in the election campaign include Prussian Prime Minister General Göring and Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels. Tonight, Buker, the special commissioner for the Saar region sent by Hitler, delivered a fiery speech before a large crowd, denouncing the Catholic Party and the Social Democratic Party, which oppose the National Socialist Party, and claiming that Germany's re-implementation of compulsory military service is a good way to guarantee peace. The audience cheered repeatedly. Buker said, "On January 13th, we announced in the Saar region that Germany respects honor, respects peace, and respects its only leader, Mr. Hitler. Now, you must turn your faces to the East!" (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Invitation to Germany to Participate in Naval Conference; British Cabinet Considers It Inappropriate; Five Countries to Meet in London First</h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored that officials from Britain, Japan, and the United States advocate inviting Germany to participate in the naval conference to be held next year, but the British Cabinet considers Germany's participation inappropriate. The Cabinet believes that the five countries, Britain, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy, should first meet in London to discuss the various main issues that have been discussed and reach an agreement before convening a second naval conference to invite other relevant countries, such as Germany, to participate in the discussion. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The naval correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reported today that Sweden may be invited to attend the naval disarmament conference to be convened this year. Germany will request battleships at the conference to replace the current pocket battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. The correspondent also said that the United States and Japan support Germany's participation in this conference. Germany's planned demands may again cause this conference and its objectives to fail, because France will also make the same request to increase its navy. France will also resolutely oppose allowing Germany to build submarines, and Britain will join in protesting this matter, because Britain lost hundreds of thousands of tons of ships during the Great War due to Swedish submarine attacks. (National Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States today continues to be concerned about Sweden's proposal to build a new fleet of 400,000 to 450,000 tons. Secretary of the Navy Swanson told reporters that Germany's navy should not disrupt the naval ratios of other countries. (National Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Remarks on the Return Trip of a Traveling Official: British and American Loans Cannot Be Realized; Investigation and Suppression of Anti-Japanese Movement to Be Conducted</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Yokotake Heitaro, the Commercial Attaché stationed in Shanghai, departed from Tokyo on the third. He boarded the Nagasaki Maru in Kobe today to return to Shanghai. After Yokotake arrives in Shanghai, he will report to Ambassador Arima on the government's policy of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and the opinions of the private sector, and also consult with the Chinese government and business community on concrete methods of economic cooperation. (Japan United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Kobe Commercial Attaché Yokotake made a speech before his departure, stating, "The first thing I realized upon returning to my country is that Japan, both the government and the public, are genuinely concerned about the Chinese issue. I lectured on the Chinese issue more than 40 times in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places, which is something I have never experienced in my past life. When I left China, I predicted that the Lunar New Year would be the most dangerous time for the Shanghai financial community. However, it is now April, and the financial community not only has no crisis but also has news of digesting 200 million yuan of domestic debt. The issue of silver outflow is also not likely to be significant. The total amount of silver owned by the Chinese people is 1 billion or 2 billion, and Shanghai alone has at least 200 million yuan of silver. This is the reality of the Chinese economy. The issue of British and American loans to China has no possibility of realization. Britain has no courage to loan alone, and American silver policy is also ineffective. How can we talk about loans? After I return to Shanghai, the first task I should carry out is to investigate how the anti-Japanese movement is being suppressed. This is not supposed to be the task of a commercial attaché, but a commercial attaché stationed in China has no choice but to do this kind of work. In short, opening up the facts and reducing the anti-Japanese movement is the goal that should be achieved first." (Japan United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>During the Feverish War, Japanese People Donate; Aircraft Reach 112; Military Supplies Worth Over 20 Million</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Army Ministry, since the Army Ministry established the National Defense Donation Acceptance Committee in December of Showa 6 (1931), as of February 28th of this year, the estimated value of the donations made by the Japanese people and various organizations to national defense reached over 22.417 million. The donated military supplies included 50 fighter planes, 14 reconnaissance planes, 35 light bombers, 6 wounded soldier transport planes, and 7 small communication liaison planes, totaling 112 planes, with a value of over 6.682 million yuan. There were also over 70 types of other military supplies, such as tanks, armored vehicles, various guns and cannons, telecommunication equipment, military horses, and military dogs.

<h3>The One Who Tied the Knot Must Untie It; Petitioning Laborers Go to Manchuria</h3>
<p>According to the Manchuria Daily News of March 29th, since the Manchurian authorities and the Kwantung Bureau formulated regulations to control labor, the Regulations for the Control of Laborers have been implemented on March 15th. Article 2 of the regulations imposes strict restrictions on labor in agriculture, forestry, fishery, industry, commerce, civil engineering construction, material transportation, and other transportation-related activities, prohibiting entry. As a result, Shandong coolies have been prevented from entering. In March of last year, 110,000 people landed in Dalian, but this year it is less than 40,000. Unexpectedly, the entire Manchurian industrial community suddenly reported an insufficient supply of laborers, especially in the Southern Manchuria industrial sector. However, the Manchurian industrial community is actively engaged in construction, and this has severely impacted the future of industry. The Dalian Industrial Association recently petitioned the Dalian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to request the Kwantung Bureau to allow laborers to enter Manchuria and to formulate special rules to ease the restrictions. The Secretary-General of the Changyong Dalian Chamber of Commerce also went to Changchun on the night of the 20th. On the 27th, the Kwantung Army Advisor Ueki exchanged views with the Kwantung Army on ways to remedy the situation. If there is no other alternative to allow laborers from inside the Shanhai Pass to go to Manchuria, then the future of Manchurian construction is quite worrying.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Qi Shou'an, the Yellow River Affairs Chief of Hebei, arrived in Tianjin on the 4th and visited Hu Yuanhui, Director of the Construction Department, to report. He said that the central government plans to allocate 40,000 yuan for the Guantai breach closure diversion dam. The diversion dam is 200 meters long. On the 27th of last month, the water level rose sharply, and the main current shifted north. The north wind was strong, and the water was counterattacked, which was an opportunity to build a diversion dam. He urged the militia to go to neighboring counties to cut willow branches to a length of 13 meters on the 30th night, and the cost was less than 1,000 yuan. Because the diversion dam was completed, the flow gradually slowed down, but most of the embankment in the Shiche section of the north bank collapsed, so it is necessary to quickly close it to prevent Guantai from being affected.

<h3>Implementing Measures for Opium Suppression</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The implementing measures for opium suppression are as follows: Article 1: Opium Suppression Procedures. In addition to adhering to the measures promulgated by the Executive Headquarters for dispatching personnel to investigate and prohibit opium cultivation, strictly enforcing regulations for prohibiting opium addiction and suppressing opium users, strictly prohibiting opium cultivation in inland provinces, suppressing the purchase of opium from border provinces, strictly prohibiting addictive drugs, suppressing opium paste shops, and other relevant regulations, all matters shall be handled in accordance with these measures. Article 2: The eight provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian are designated as absolutely opium-free provinces. Starting from April of this year, a general inspection will be implemented. Senior officials will be selected and dispatched, or personnel will be designated, to go to each province, cooperate with the provincial governments to effectively monitor and supervise the implementation. If opium seedlings are still found in counties that have already reported complete suppression, once verified, the county magistrate, the suppression committee member, and the district and village chiefs, as well as the opium farmers, will be severely punished according to military law. If there is any gathering of people to resist eradication, troops will be dispatched immediately to arrest the ringleaders, who will be executed by firing squad on the spot. If any police, military, or security teams protect opium cultivation, and the county magistrate is unable to prevent it, a secret report may be made directly to arrest and punish them. If a county magistrate fails to report and eradicate opium seedlings within his jurisdiction, or privately collects donations, once verified, he will be executed by firing squad to serve as a warning. Subsequently, during the planting season each year, inspections should be ordered and conducted, and reports should be submitted in accordance with regulations. A general inspection should be carried out during the emergence of seedlings to prevent a resurgence. Article 3: The provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu have been approved for phased opium suppression. According to the reports submitted by the two provinces, the opium suppression will be implemented in three phases according to the original plan. The counties that have already reported complete suppression will be inspected as scheduled in accordance with the previous article. The counties in the two provinces that are scheduled to implement opium suppression in the second and third phases should also be completely cleared within the specified time. Article 4: Each province and city should be responsible for carrying out the re-registration of opium addicts in accordance with the regulations for strictly prohibiting opium addiction and suppressing opium users. This should be thoroughly completed within six months. In the first three months, persuasion should be used to encourage registration, and efforts should be made to promote it. If there are still those who conceal themselves and fail to register, they should be completely ordered to register and forcibly executed within the three-month period. A simple method for issuing licenses for poor opium addicts should be established to remove obstacles to registration, in order to obtain accurate statistics on opium addicts as a standard for annual reduction. Those who fail to register after the deadline will no longer be allowed to register. If any unregistered individuals are found after the deadline, they should all be detained and ordered to quit. The number of people registered at the final registration deadline in the 24th year of the Republic will be taken as the total number, and compulsory detoxification will be carried out in order of the age of the opium addicts, divided into five phases, with one year as each phase. The minimum reduction each year is one-fifth. The first phase ends at the end of the 25th year of the Republic, reducing opium addicts by one-fifth. The second phase ends at the end of the 26th year of the Republic, reducing opium addicts by one-quarter. The third phase ends at the end of the 27th year of the Republic, reducing opium addicts by one-third. The fourth phase ends at the end of the 28th year of the Republic, reducing opium addicts by one-third. The fifth phase ends at the end of the 29th year of the Republic, completely eradicating opium addiction. Regarding the registration of opium addicts, if the regulations for strictly prohibiting opium addiction and suppressing opium users are not suitable for the actual situation of each province and city, causing opium addicts to hesitate to come forward to register, each province and city may carefully review and draft detailed implementation rules and submit them for approval, allowing for flexibility. Article 5: All personnel serving in the Party, government, and military, as well as faculty and students in schools, are absolutely prohibited from smoking opium. Those who have already become addicted are allowed to report and are given a deadline to quit. Those who conceal their addiction or relapse after reporting and quitting will be punished with the most severe penalties in accordance with military law. In addition to revising and promulgating the Measures for Limiting the Time for Quitting Opium for Party, Government, and Military Service Personnel and Students, as well as the Regulations for Quitting Opium Adjustment and Verification, which were promulgated in September of the 21st year of the Republic by the Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, the heads of Party, military, government, and school institutions, and all levels of responsible officials, shall be responsible for layer-by-layer supervision, as well as the organization of adjustment and verification and compulsory detoxification. Article 6: In each province and city, in order to limit opium smoking, before the 29th year of the Republic, the opium needed by all addicts should be purchased from border provinces by specially appointed merchants, in accordance with the Statistics on the purchase quantity, the merchants should adhere to the Regulations for Suppressing the Purchase of Opium from Border Provinces, apply for purchase permits, go to border provinces to purchase, and specify the transportation route. Temporarily follow the joint transportation procedure, with the Opium Suppression Supervisory Office implementing public transportation. After arriving at the destination, it should all be unloaded into public warehouses and distributed for sale. The quantity required by registered addicts in the 24th year of the Republic should be used as the standard for public purchase and transportation. From the 25th year of the Republic, the quantity required by addicts should be investigated and reduced year by year. All private transportation is prohibited, and violators will be treated as private traffickers. Article 7: The Opium Suppression Supervisory Office, in consultation with the provincial and municipal governments, should determine the number of opium paste shops allowed to be established in each province and city within two months after the completion of the re-registration of opium addicts, and report it together with the number of opium paste shops established by the Opium Suppression Supervisory Office in each province and city, as the final standard for the number of opium paste shops. Implement the Regulations for Suppressing Opium Paste Shops, purchase and sell opium paste with permits, and reduce sales year by year based on the quantity needed in the 24th year of the Republic, and also reduce the number of opium paste shops. Article 8: The Opium Suppression Supervisory Office is responsible for handling the suppression of transportation and sales. The civil affairs department of each province, the public security bureau of each city, the county magistrate, or the opium suppression committee shall be the responsible authorities for the suppression of opium cultivation and smoking and the suppression of smuggling within their respective jurisdictions. However, if the Opium Suppression Supervisory Office has specially established anti-smuggling agencies or patrol teams within its jurisdiction, the agency or team should be responsible for performing its duties in accordance with the anti-smuggling regulations. The local responsible authorities should assist at any time. Article 9: Each province, city, and county shall establish an opium suppression committee within one month. The committee shall be responsible for assisting in opium suppression and detoxification matters. (1) An opium suppression committee headquarters shall be established in the area where the Executive Headquarters is located, and fair and enthusiastic opium suppression advocates from all areas shall be appointed as members.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Strict Order: Investigation and Prohibition of Opium Poppy Cultivation in Eight Provinces; Promulgation of General Reporting Methods, Swift and Effective Enforcement; Joint Responsibility by Special Envoys and Provincial Governments</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: In order to thoroughly prohibit the cultivation of opium seedlings, Chairman Chiang has recently designated Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Henan provinces as absolute opium prohibition areas. General reporting methods have been formulated, and Wang Lie, Liu Weitan, and others have been appointed by the Executive Headquarters to jointly execute them with the respective provincial governments. The main points of the said methods, telegraphed to the military and political organs of each province on the 2nd for compliance, are recorded as follows: (1) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces are designated as absolute opium prohibition provinces, while Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are designated as provinces with phased opium prohibition. All matters related to prohibiting sowing and investigating opium seedlings shall be the responsibility of the respective provinces. In order to promote investigation and prohibition and increase efficiency, special opium prohibition envoys dispatched by the Executive Headquarters of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission shall implement general reporting together with the provincial governments. (2) When implementing general reporting, in each administrative region, one or two committee members shall be dispatched by the provincial government's Civil Affairs Department, Security Department, administrative inspector, commissioner, and county government, to accompany the special envoy or jointly investigate and prohibit commissioners, and go to various counties, deep into rural areas, to carefully investigate and prohibit. The district chiefs and Baojia chiefs shall also accompany the inspection of all reporting matters. (3) The reporting period is limited to three months, from March to the end of May. If there are special circumstances, an extension may be requested, but the extension time shall not exceed one month. (4) All places where opium poppy cultivation has never existed and have been designated as absolute opium prohibition areas shall be subject to investigation. For counties where opium cultivation has never existed, after accurate verification, the administrative commissioner shall report to the provincial government and the special envoy for approval, and the county magistrate shall separately submit a written guarantee stating, "If opium seedlings are found to have emerged within the territory, I am willing to face the death penalty," and may be exempted from investigation, or subject to random checks as appropriate. (5) When opium seedlings are discovered during the implementation of general reporting, they shall be immediately uprooted, and the cultivating households shall be arrested and sent to legal authorities for prosecution, and the land shall be confiscated. If they defy the law and dare to gather crowds to resist, the stationed troops shall be allowed to strictly arrest the ringleaders, and a telegram shall be sent to the Executive Headquarters for approval, and they shall be executed immediately. (6) If opium seedlings are still found in counties that have been reported as opium-free after the investigation, the county magistrate, district chief, and Baojia chief of the county shall be jointly punished. The special envoy shall report the facts to the Executive Headquarters for strict punishment according to military law. (7) If it is found that unscrupulous military police units, officials, or local bullies dare to harbor opium cultivation or privately collect donations, the main persons shall be strictly arrested, and a telegram shall be sent to the Executive Headquarters for approval, and they shall be executed immediately. (8) When the special envoy implements general reporting together with the local government, if local military and political officials fail to implement effectively, thereby preventing them from exercising their powers and completing their tasks, the special envoy may report to the Executive Headquarters for instructions on how to handle it. (9) Each county for general reporting shall be divided into several districts, and held in phases. The location and date shall be determined by the special envoy or proposed by the investigation and prohibition commissioner and submitted to the special envoy for approval. (10) When general reporting is implemented, troops should be dispatched immediately to assist without delay. Commissioners or committee members at all levels may also bring police or troops to conduct on-site inspections in rural areas, but personnel and soldiers at all levels must be careful in handling matters and must not cause disturbances by taking advantage of the situation. (11) The investigation and prohibition commissioner shall report the reporting situation to the special envoy every day and forward it to the Executive Headquarters for review. (12) After inspecting each county, the special envoy shall list the actual reporting situation and the merits and demerits of the county's opium prohibition achievements in a detailed table and add a note, and forward it to the Executive Headquarters for assessment. The table format shall be separately determined. (13) The special envoy shall, together with the provincial government, strictly supervise its subordinates to earnestly proceed, and when necessary, still personally visit various districts for inspection. (14) The special envoy and the investigation and prohibition commissioner shall break away from personal feelings, seek truth from facts, and earnestly report. They shall not accept any entertainment from the local area or conceal information out of favor. Those who violate this shall be considered as colluding to act in self-interest. (15) If there are any omissions due to different circumstances in various provinces, the special envoy may, together with the provincial government, formulate implementing rules for supplementation. (16) These methods shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, Smuggling of Goods Increases Daily; More Than 500 People Involved in Smuggling; Qinhuangdao Customs Officers Wounded by Private Smugglers</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Recently, incidents of Japanese smuggling of tax-evading goods between Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao have emerged endlessly. As a result, conflicts between customs and smugglers have also increased day by day. Last year, the Japanese used dozens of motorboats to transport goods such as ramie yarn, sugar, foreign cloth, and rayon from Dalian, Yingkou, and other places to the Shigekou and Duoluo River estuary for unloading. A group organized by the Japanese transported the goods to the Chadong area for distribution. Since the shooting of customs officers in Shigekou, although the dispute has been resolved, customs has paid special attention to the area, and tax police officers have been dispatched to patrol and permanently station there for permanent prevention. Japanese goods can no longer be imported as unimpeded as before. In early March of this year, with the prosperity of Huludao Port, Japanese cargo ships directly entered the port, and there was a railway connecting to Jinxi. The port was designated as the only tail waterway for smuggling. After the goods were landed, they were loaded onto vehicles and transported to Suizhong County, and then transported by camels from Suizhong to outside Shanhaiguan. They were then carried by small vendors over the Great Wall, avoiding the main roads of the checkpoints, and sent to Beidaihe or Qinhuangdao for delivery. The Japanese then used trucks to transport the goods to various counties and towns for dumping. Due to tax evasion, the price of every 100 yuan of goods can be reduced by 35%. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants in various cities are happy to accept illicit goods due to the great profit, and are willing to promote them, resulting in the flooding of Japanese goods in various places, which cannot be counted in numbers. This smuggling group is presided over by Japanese, and hires more than 500 Chinese traitors and Koreans to enter and exit Shanhaiguan inside and outside in shifts. Each person smuggles about 400 to 500 yuan of goods each time. Smuggling takes place at night, entering from the Jiao Mountain Temple next to Shanhaiguan, crossing the Great Wall. The private smugglers are armed with firearms, and resist with force when they encounter customs detectives. Therefore, customs personnel are wary. On the morning of the 28th of last month, Qinhuangdao detective Li Baohuan and a colleague patrolled to the side of the Beining Railway Bridge and encountered three smugglers transporting illicit goods. Just as they were about to step forward to search, the three smugglers suddenly took out guns and shot, causing Li to be hit by three bullets and fall to the ground. The three smugglers took the opportunity to escape. Li was rescued by his companion, his injuries were very serious, and he has been sent to Qinhuangdao Hospital for treatment. After this incident occurred, Hao Gede, the tax affairs director of Qinhuangdao, telegraphed the chief of the general customs of the Ministry of Finance to report and requested instructions on future investigation and patrol methods. On the 21st, near the South Great Temple of Shanhaiguan, customs personnel discovered nine large vehicles of Chinese traitors transporting illicit goods such as ramie yarn, intending to smuggle them across the Great Wall into the pass. The customs officers stopped them, and the accompanying Koreans opened fire. The customs officers returned fire in self-defense. The Korean and the Chinese traitor Wang Zihe fled to Dongluocheng. Before long, several Japanese military police officers from the customs arrived and arrested the customs officers, claiming that the goods were for military use and should not be seized. After customs personnel negotiated, the customs officers were released. Therefore, the customs officers felt that investigating and suppressing smuggling was becoming more and more difficult.

Zhong director learned of this and urgently sent more than 60 workers to the dam along the coast to dig soil and check the danger, which lasted all night. However, the water was surging and breaches were occurring everywhere, resulting in the inundation of the entire section, reaching a depth of about two meters. He immediately reported the situation to Bi County Magistrate, who was also the director of the Xiangcao River project. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Bi immediately went to inspect it for a week, took photos, and ordered the Zhen workers in Jintan County to temporarily return to Lair to wait for the water to be drained before being notified to start work.

The case was secretly reported to the provincial government by gentlemen and merchants in the town. The provincial government sent Yang Jinbiao, a police instructor from Shan-Jia, to investigate and verify the facts, which caused a sensation in Shanghai. The society has been paying attention to it. It is learned that the county court specially opened an investigation court yesterday. Prosecutor Zhang Bingsheng interrogated in court in great detail. As a result, Cheng Peiren (the town mayor who offered the bribe) was released on bail for 300 yuan. Qiu Zeshen was detained because he did not have 500 yuan in cash.

The remaining houses were sublet by Zhida to Zheng Jingfu, the owner of the Dasheng Paper Store, and his brother Shunfu, etc., and the warehouse of the paper store was also inside. Unexpectedly, at about 4:00 am this morning (the 3rd), a fire suddenly broke out in the house. The neighbors were awakened from their dreams and went to try to rescue.

At the same time, a police officer named Chen Guang was shot in the head and died instantly. The bandit then fled to Xikou. Fortunately, the Third Public Security Sub-bureau had sent three police officers, Ma Wenchang and others, to guard the pass. They encountered Qiu Bandit. The bandit raised his gun to shoot and shot and killed police officer Ma Wenchang. At that time, the other two police officers also returned fire, but due to the late hour, he still escaped. Afterwards, the police officer returned to the bureau and reported everything.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Establishment of the Eastern Township Sericulture Guidance Center</h3>
<p>The eastern township of Xiaoshan is an area that produces silk cocoons. Silk farming households are lined up and mulberry trees are everywhere. Because all silk farming households are not improved, sales have decreased greatly in recent years. Since the establishment of the Sericulture Guidance Center by the Provincial Construction Department last year to promote improved seeds, the sales of silk cocoons have gradually developed. This year, the Sericulture Guidance Center was officially established on April 1. At that time, in addition to dispatching personnel from the Fifth and Sixth Districts to guide, Ms. Zuo Suzhen was dispatched by the province to Xiaoshan to guide households. On the one hand, three major cases were resolved: (1) After each silk farming household releases silkworms, women instructors will guide them separately. (2) Banning the mixing of other species or native species. (3) After the improved species are raised by silk farming households, the price of new cocoons will be increased.</p>

<p>Holding Ceremony</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the celebration ceremony was held. The presidium included Pan Gongzhan, Li Ting'an, Cai Jingjun, Hu Shuyi, Wu Xingya (represented by Chen Lengseng), Yang Xiaotian (represented by Wang Jiyi), Chen Jicheng, Lin Kecong, and Chen Tiesheng.

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Director Pan reported, stating briefly, "Today is the anniversary of the Children's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Originally, Mayor Wu was supposed to come in person to deliver a speech, but due to other important matters, I am representing him. The Chinese Child Welfare Association and the Children's Welfare Association have presented to the National Government and stipulated April 4th as Children's Day. This is now the fifth year. Recently, it has been presented to the National Government and stipulated that August 1st of this year will be Children's Year. Today, Party, government, and various organizations are jointly holding a grand celebration, which shows that the government and society attach great importance to children. Everyone knows that China is now very dangerous, but does not know that the future world situation is even more serious. China's danger will be even greater in the future than it is today. Rescuing the danger now relies on adults, and in the future, it will rely on you children. While you are still minors, the government will of course find ways to educate you and nurture you, so that your bodies, knowledge, morals, and abilities all have a foundation, so that you can save the country from danger in the future. Therefore, the first significance of celebrating Children's Day today is that you will contribute to the country and the nation in the future. Second, there are three to four hundred thousand school-age children in Shanghai, and only a few thousand people are here today. There are still many children who do not have the opportunity to participate, and even do not have enough to eat and struggle on the line of life and death. You are fortunate to participate in this, and you must help other children anytime, anywhere. Through this celebration meeting, we also call on the majority of adults in society to pay attention to the education of general children. Third, Shanghai is the focus of national attention, and every move is enough to affect the whole country. The order and discipline of the children participating in the Shanghai celebration meeting is related to the children of the whole country. Therefore, you children of Shanghai have a greater responsibility than other places. You should be a model for children across the country."</p>
<p>Party and Government Speeches</p>
<p>Director Li Ting'an of the Health Bureau said, in brief, "The meaning of holding a children's celebration today is to seek the interests of children. Children are the future masters of China. You must create yourselves and hope that the mothers of Shanghai will pay special attention to the education of children," and so on. Jiang Huaisu, a member of the City Party Department, said, in brief, "On this day commemorating Children's Day, I hope for two points: (1) I hope that educational authorities and social figures will find ways to solve the problem of children not attending school. (2) I hope that all parents will pay attention to children's health issues." Lin Kecong also had a speech, which is omitted.</p>
<p>Children's Response</p>
<p>Gu Senbao, a student from Danhua Elementary School representing the children, said in brief, "Ladies and gentlemen, children, today, all sectors of Shanghai are holding a Children's Day celebration ceremony here. Just now, many teachers have guided us, and everyone has understood it. Now, I respectfully represent the children of Shanghai to thank all the teachers, and I hope that all the children will follow what the teachers have guided us to do and not disappoint the teachers' enthusiasm," and so on.</p>

<h3>President Wang is Coming to Shanghai To Host a Banquet for Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries Time… 7:30 PM on the 7th Address… Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Executive Yuan President Wang plans to attend the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London and hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai. He will hold a banquet for Chinese and foreign dignitaries at 7:30 PM on the 7th of this month (Sunday) at the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. It is reported that those invited include the presidents and ministers of various central departments, military attachés from various countries, and more than 100 leaders from various agencies and sectors in the city. At that time, there will be a constant stream of cars and horses, which will be extremely grand.</p>
<h3>Three Banks to Rescue Industry and Commerce Negotiating Methods in the Shortest Term</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that in order to strengthen the capital of the Central, China, and Communications Banks and to rescue the decline of industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance has issued 100 million yuan in financial public bonds. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the financial community, the financial public bonds are entirely for rescuing the market and have been properly allocated, but they are not circulating on the market, only used as a reserve for issuing banknotes. In this way, in the midst of the current market downturn, a batch of active cash can be indirectly increased for industry and commerce to mortgage and borrow, and the market can circulate.</p>
<p>Negotiating Methods in the Nearest Term</p>
<p>The three banks are based on this purpose and are working together, so in the short term, they will organize a banking group to facilitate progress. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the banking sector, the Central, China, and Communications Banks will negotiate methods in the short term to quickly rescue the decline of industry and commerce and facilitate progress. The time will be approximately after the implementation of the 5 million yuan industrial and commercial credit small loan.</p>
<p>Underwriting Mortgages and Circulating the Market</p>
<p>It is heard that the three banks' rescue methods will still focus on mortgage loans. Currently, the market is declining, and the banking sector is timid and does not dare to underwrite large mortgage loans because there is no large amount of capital and they are afraid of facing turnover difficulties. Now, with increased capital and cooperation, all industries can obtain financial assistance, and the circulation will be smooth and lively, then the market will improve, which is naturally expected.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Song Ziwen Regularly Meets with Journalists Foreign Telegraphs Spread Unconfirmed Stories of Monetary Conference</h3>
<p>New News Agency reports that since taking over as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, has been going to the bank for days to handle various important official duties and has been extremely busy. Because the outside world is quite concerned about the future business policy of the Bank of China, Song has specially set aside the 9th (next Tuesday) to openly meet with reporters from various newspapers on the third floor of the Bank of China on Hankou Road Bund to make remarks and elaborate on the future facilities of the Bank of China and opinions on rescuing finance. Regarding the propaganda by Havas Agency on the 2nd that the government will follow the British suggestion and invite representatives from the banking sectors of Britain, France, the United States, Japan, and Belgium to hold a monetary conference in Beijing, Zhu believes that this is inaccurate. He believes that even if China needs to discuss the issue of unifying the monetary system in fact, there is no need to invite foreign bankers to participate.</p>

<h3>法租界 Taxpaying Chinese Association Protests Increased Levies and Power Outages; Requests Immediate Restoration of Water and Electricity and Negotiation of Tax Amounts by Industry</h3>
<p>The French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, based on a complaint from the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation regarding member Ju Shun Yi Sauce Garden on 187 Ximen Road, which was subjected to increased alcohol tax and electricity cut-off by the French Municipal Council, sent a letter of protest to the French Municipal Council yesterday. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Ju Shun Yi Sauce Garden at 187 Ximen Road reports that in September of last year, the French Municipal Council increased the original alcohol tax from $2.80 to $7.00. We then wrote to your association to request the French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association to negotiate with the French Municipal Council. Subsequently, the director of the Bureau personally investigated, and in December, the tax collector collected the accumulated tax arrears for four months (totaling $11.20) and indicated that the increased tax might be cancelled in the future. On February 28th of this year, we suddenly received a letter from the Bureau stating that our alcohol tax was set at $5.00 per month, with two months in arrears, requiring a supplementary payment of $10.00 within three days, or else water and electricity would be cut off. After translating and reading this, we were extremely perplexed. Our business of Shaoxing wine is very small in scale, unlike specialized Shaoxing wine businesses, and we have records to prove this. Now, the French Municipal Council's collection of a third-class monthly tax is already excessive. If it is suddenly increased to $5.00, it will be even more unfair. While we were requesting assistance from your association, the electricity was actually cut off on March 25th. We specifically request your association to uphold justice and provide swift relief.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the case of the increased tax for this business was previously negotiated by your association. Now, the electricity has been cut off, oppressing merchants, which is improper in both law and reason. Therefore, we request your association to urge the French Municipal Council to improve the temporary rules for cutting off water and electricity, in order to secure business. Cutting off water and electricity is contrary to the intention of the municipal authorities to care for merchants and residents. The improvement measures requested by the association are deeply reasonable. In addition to separate letters to the Chinese directors, we jointly request your honorable Municipal Council to first restore the electricity to the business, collect the accumulated original tax according to the original amount, and in the future, for similar incidents, the sauce and wine industries in the French Concession should determine the tax amounts separately according to their respective levels, in order to avoid disputes. Whether or not to adopt this measure, we pray for your wise decision and prompt reply, so that we may inform them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Steamers Increase Schedules; Yueyang Maru Resumes Service</h3>
<p>The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha Yangtze River steamers originally had eleven vessels. In the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, there were another fourteen vessels, with business equal to that of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, and larger than that of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After the January 28th Incident, due to boycotts in various ports, the company's Yangtze River ships were all suspended. After three years of planning, only four ships, such as the Luoyang Maru and Nanyang Maru, were restored to service. Only one ship was opened on the upper reaches of the Yangtze. Recently, the import of Japanese goods into China has greatly increased, with Nisshin Kisen Kaisha cargo ships arriving at the docks fully loaded each time. The cargo transferred to the Yangtze River has increased by another one-half compared to before. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has taken advantage of this great opportunity to restore the Yangtze River ships that had been suspended for more than three years to their normal schedules. The Yueyang Maru has been repaired and completed and has summoned all of the disbanded crew and sailors, and from April 2nd, has joined the Shanghai-Hankou line. Currently, the company has five ships operating on the Yangtze River route. The company is also planning to restore the remaining suspended ships step by step.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Telegraph Reply to the Banking Association Regarding Railway Bills of Lading</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways telegraphed a reply to the Shanghai Banking Association, stating that the improvement of railway bills of lading is under discussion by the Ministry. Currently, the Association is requested to inform all member banks and advise merchants to exchange for bills of lading. In the future, receipts for goods stored in yards and freight receipts will not be accepted for mortgages. Furthermore, if station staff members deliberately delay or refuse to issue bills of lading when merchants apply for them, please report this immediately to the Ministry or the local railway bureaus. Once verified, they will be punished. In addition to ordering each railway to actively promote bills of lading, and sending personnel to inspect and supervise the handling of each station, a deadline has been set for reporting the situation. This telegram is for your information.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Ministry of Finance, Requesting Prompt Abolition of National Goods Transit Tax and Appropriate Increase of Import Tax to Offset the Loss</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating:</p>
<p>Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing,</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, a joint letter from the Chinese Paper Mill Federation, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, and the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association stated that the domestically produced products of Chinese mechanized factories, when transported to various provinces for sale, are required to pay transit taxes. Your association and national factory organizations have repeatedly requested the government to exempt these taxes, but no action has been taken. Currently, our national products are suffering from the dumping of foreign goods, coupled with the impact of low gold prices and high silver prices. The national industries are in imminent danger and are barely surviving. We previously read in the newspapers that Minister Kong spoke about immediately removing import taxes, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and would be implemented simultaneously with the 100 million financial public debt, but recently, there has been no further news. This matter is of great importance to national industry and commerce. Our association has separately telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, urging them to issue the order immediately to save the critical situation, and requesting your association to telegraph the various ministries and departments in Nanjing to urge them to issue the order immediately, so as to avoid any changes. We sincerely hope for this.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the meeting, it was found that the current transit tax, the abolished inland half tax, and the re-import half tax are all domestic pass-through taxes in nature. According to the tariff systems of modern countries, they should not be retained. It was only because of the government's financial difficulties at the time, and the need to comprehensively plan the budget, that a gradual approach was necessary. Now, we are fortunate that your ministry understands the bleak market situation and has proposed a resolute abolition, which has been widely welcomed by merchants and residents, who are eagerly anticipating its implementation. The issue that is currently being considered is the problem of compensation. It is reported that the annual revenue from the transit tax is only 15 million. If a few import goods, either non-daily necessities or daily necessities that are in competition with domestic products, can be selected for appropriate increase in import tax to make up the shortfall, there should be no difference in government funds. Since your ministry has this proposal, it should already have a plan on how to make up the shortfall. We pray that you will finalize the plan and implement it as soon as possible, so that the commercial difficulties can be alleviated and everyone can feel the comfort of hope.</p>

<h3>Cotton and Textile Industries Follow Suit; Promoting Commercial Acceptance Drafts; Ke Ganchen and Zhu Wenqi Reply to Luo Qinghua, Having Submitted Proposals to Respective Trade Associations for Consensus and Implementation</h3>
<p>Since the proposal for commercial acceptance drafts was put forward by Mr. Luo Qinghua, the chairman of the Silk and Satin Industry Association, it has been widely supported. The silk and satin industry and the electric silk weaving factory have already taken the lead in formally implementing it from April 1st, and it is progressing very smoothly. Luo Qinghua recently sent separate letters to Mr. Ke Ganchen, a leader in the cotton weaving industry, and Mr. Zhu Wenqi, a leader in the dyeing and weaving industry, requesting their support in promoting it. Ke and Luo have now replied, stating that they have submitted proposals to their respective trade associations for unanimous promotion, in order to alleviate the current difficulties. The original letters from the two gentlemen are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Wenqi's Letter</p>
<p>Zhu Wenqi's reply states that he received the letter, advocating commercial acceptance drafts, and believes that the financial panic in Shanghai is unprecedented. The reason is the large amount of import surplus and the large-scale export of silver. Commentators often say that promoting national products to reduce imports or the United States voluntarily abandoning its silver policy can end the panic. However, the first priority for imports is the food and cotton needed for our lives. In the present situation where rural construction has not yet been put on track, it is difficult to ensure its effectiveness. To expect the cessation of silver collection is even more like seeking skin from a tiger. At this most difficult time, we industrialists and businessmen must come up with a self-saving plan. The commercial acceptance drafts created by the teacher are a perfect and effective way to save ourselves. Your planning has benefited merchants greatly. In addition to submitting the proposal to our industry association for unanimous promotion, I hereby reply specially, wishing you peace. Your younger brother Zhu Zhiwenqi respectfully.</p>
<p>Ke Ganchen's Letter</p>
<p>Ke Ganchen's reply states that he received the letter yesterday, detailing the procedures for implementing acceptance drafts, and learned that your industry has already implemented it on April 1st, which shows your determination and is deeply admired. Acceptance drafts are popular in Europe and the United States and have been effective for a long time. Our country's business community has always adopted a credit-based system. As a result of years of import surplus and the impact of the US silver policy last year, silver and goods have flowed out, and the domestic currency has become scarce. In addition, rural areas are declining, and industries and businesses are going bankrupt. People are anxious and eager to remedy the situation. Although various parties have repeatedly called for relief and made many suggestions, the most self-saving, practical and easy to implement is your brother's implementation of acceptance drafts. With the progress of modern society, personnel affairs are becoming more complicated. Relying solely on the credit-based loans of the past is not enough to cope with the current environment. In a so-called capitalist society, the circulation of industrial securities is still needed. General businesses are afraid of extending credit and also suffer from the stagnation of debt collection, which affects the circulation of the economy. If acceptance drafts are implemented, they will transform stagnation into circulation and are a good medicine for the problem. However, there are two points to be studied: (1) Whether the various industries themselves can unite and be consistent in their actions and words; (2) Whether the money industry can do its best to cooperate and discount as much as possible. These still need our efforts to achieve the implementation of controlled trade, in order to ensure its success. With the enthusiastic promotion of your industry and the sincere support of the leaders in the financial community, your brother's call will surely be echoed by the masses. Eliminating abuses and benefiting others is not the job of strangers, and extraordinary achievements depend on your brother. Your younger brother will not hesitate to do his best to work together to promote progress. In addition to requesting the colleagues of my industry to agree, I also plan to convene a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees immediately to discuss and decide on the implementation. I hope you will not hesitate to give us your guidance so that we can attach ourselves to your success. If there are any difficulties in the promotion, I hope you will show them so that we can try to overcome them together.</p>
<p>Respectfully, wishing you peace. Your younger brother Ke Ganchen respectfully.</p>

<h3>Chinese Man Killed by American Soldier Identified as Zhang Songxiang; Worked as a Servant in a Westerner's Home; Family Claimed the Body Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of this month at approximately 9:00 PM, a drunken American sailor, arm in arm with a Russian dancer, was walking along Rue de la Sainte Famille in the French Concession and beat an unnamed male passerby for no reason, causing him to bleed from the nose and faint. He was sent to the hospital. Due to severe concussion, he died despite medical treatment. The body was reported to the Second Special Court, which sent personnel to verify the identity. The body was collected by the party. The sailor who caused the accident was sent by the French police to the commander's headquarters for interrogation. All of this was previously reported. It was not until yesterday that a man from Yangzhou, Zhang Deyuan (38 years old, residing at 243 Xinxin Lane, Rue du Pere Froc), went to the morgue to identify the deceased as his younger brother, Zhang Songxiang, 32 years old, who worked as a servant in a Westerner's home at No. 1 Jingan Villa, Jingan Temple Road. He has a wife and children. Today, he petitioned the court to claim the body for burial and is preparing to make representations.</p>
<h3>Robbers Fighting with Police; Stray Bullet Kills a Rickshaw Puller; Accident on Rue Sibeixing; Jiang Xichang Died in Vain</h3>
<p>At approximately 9:00 PM the night before last, robbers broke into the Mingjing Machinery Factory on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei. A neighbor noticed and called the police to arrest them. Immediately, police whistles sounded in chaos. The robbers knew that things were not good and fled in all directions. The police tracked and arrested them. In desperation, the robbers opened fire to resist arrest. The police also opened fire in return, chasing them to Rue Sibeixing. A rickshaw puller, Jiang Xichang (41 years old, from Chongming), happened to be passing by pulling a rickshaw when he was hit in the chest by a stray bullet, damaging a vital organ. He immediately fell to the ground and died. Yesterday morning, the police station in charge ordered the local security chief, Yan Liugen, to report to the local court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhang Zi was appointed and accompanied by Examiner Xuan Zhiming to the scene for verification. It was ordered that the body be coffined and investigated. The deceased left behind a wife and three children, all of whom depended on the deceased for their livelihood. Now that he has died tragically, they have lost their support. His wife's cries were tragic, and those who saw them were saddened.</p>
<h3>Six-Year-Old Assault Case Adjudicated</h3>
<p>Dai Aying, a man from Haimen who opened a pig slaughterhouse on Yuezhou Road, died in the autumn of 1927. His wife remarried his partner, Lu Shouchang. However, the partners from Haimen, Dong Chenggui and Xiang Dongsheng, were quite dissatisfied with this matter and made things difficult for them. They demanded money unsuccessfully, and the grudges deepened. At approximately 1:00 AM on the morning of September 20, 1929, they colluded with A Wu, Shen A Er, Wang Yougen, and others who were soldiers on the run, and A Wu opened fire near the intersection of Yuezhou Road and Zhaofeng Road, shooting at Lu Shouchang in an attempt to take his life. However, he did not hit a vital organ, and they fled in a panic. Hua Pu No. 2247 rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and only found two shell casings. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment and was fortunately discharged shortly after suffering a slight bullet graze on his back. The case was reported to the Jiading Road police station, but the perpetrators could not be apprehended. Six years passed until Hua Tan Long, Shao Yingfan, and Gan Tan, Chen Jinsheng, and Li Yinmin, arrested Dong Chenggui on Zhoujiazui Road on the morning of the 20th of last month at 8:55 AM. Wang Yougen, a man from Pudong, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau for a theft case in the Chinese area and was brought back to the police station. Dong and Dong were escorted to the First Special District Court. Dong Chenggui admitted that A Wu fired the shot. Wang Yougen claimed that he was invited by Dong to fight at the time and only heard the sound of gunfire when they arrived at the scene, so he fled and did not actually do anything. He said that he was fooled by Dong and others. They were ordered to be detained pending sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the court and sentenced Dong Chenggui to six years in prison. The number of days of detention before the determination of the judgment shall be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. The shell casings were confiscated. Wang Yougen was found not guilty. Industrial and Commercial Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan requested that he be remanded in custody during the appeal period, and the court approved.</p>
<h3>Village Woman's Affair and Pregnancy: Hundreds of Attempts at Abortion Lead to Tragic Death; Also Fearing Childbirth and Unable to Face People, She Resolves to Abort; A Medicinal Herb Inserted into Her Lower Body Proves Fatal</h3>
<p>Wang Dou-shi, a woman from the northern countryside of Yangzhou, is currently twenty-eight years old. Her husband, surnamed Wang, earns a living farming in their village. She has three children with him. Due to the family's poverty, she left her children to be cared for by her husband and came to Shanghai three years ago to work as a servant, using her wages to supplement the household income. Recently, she has been employed as a servant in the home of a family surnamed *Mou* in Yuqing Lane on Wenzhou Road in the Public Concession of this city. Her employer calls her Wang Ma. Around the eleventh month of the lunar calendar last year, while getting water at the public stove at the entrance of the lane, she met Li Xiu-jian, a fellow villager who works as a back scrubber at the hot spring bathhouse on the corner of Yunnan Road and Avenue Edward VII. This year, he is twenty-four years old. The two took an immediate liking to each other, found each other compatible, and had a great sense of</p>
<p>"meeting each other too late."</p>
<p>Soon, they engaged in a physical relationship. However, Li already has a wife who is with him in Shanghai. After Li began his affair with Dou-shi, he sent his wife back to their hometown and lived with Dou-shi. Unexpectedly, after several secret rendezvous, Dou-shi became pregnant. Now, more than three months along, she deeply fears that if she carries the pregnancy to term, the affair will be exposed, and she will be unable to face her husband and family. After discussing it thoroughly with her lover, Li Xiu-jian, they decided to abort the pregnancy. She spent three *yuan* and purchased musk from a traditional Chinese medicine store, but after swallowing it, it had</p>
<p>absolutely no effect.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, Li accompanied her to the home of an elderly midwife, Li Wang-shi, a native of Nanjing, located at No. 6 Milu Road, Fangbang Bridge in the French Concession. They requested her to find a way to perform an abortion. The midwife demanded fifteen *yuan*. Li and Dou-shi did not haggle over the price, only seeking to terminate the pregnancy, so they paid the full amount. Dou-shi stayed overnight at the midwife's house. The next afternoon, the midwife first inserted a medicinal herb (called *duijiecao*, or "connecting grass") into Dou-shi's lower body, but it still had no effect. The midwife then went to Wanxiangchun Herbal Medicine Store at No. 155 Bair Road and spent 670 *wen* to purchase a dose of an ancient formula labor-inducing drug,</p>
<p>consisting of four herbs.</p>
<p>After returning and having Dou-shi swallow it, it finally worked on the afternoon of the 30th. A piece of flesh from Dou-shi's abdomen was expelled. On the 1st of this month, the midwife urged Li to come and take Dou-shi away. Because Li had not rented a house in Shanghai and had nowhere to settle, he sent Dou-shi to stay temporarily with a relative at No. 40 Hongrui Lane on Xinfulu to rest and recover. Unexpectedly, after this ordeal, Dou-shi's body weakened, and she suffered unbearable abdominal pain. At 10:45 AM on the 3rd, Li accompanied Dou-shi to the Huilv Hospital at No. 130 Avenue Avénue Road, claiming that she was suffering from a miscarriage due to pregnancy and requested treatment. The hospital admitted her. Subsequently, after Dr. Xu Daoheng examined Dou-shi's uterus, he suspected that</p>
<p>there was a foreign object</p>
<p>causing decay and an unbearable stench. He determined that it was not a miscarriage but definitely a result of an induced abortion. As per regulations, he reported it to the Xin Zha Gate Police Station in charge. Detective Li Shi-kun was dispatched and brought Li Xiu-jian, the lover who had accompanied Dou-shi to the hospital, to the police station. Under interrogation, Li confessed the truth. The police chief, noting that the crime scene was in the French Concession, ordered Detective Li to transfer Li Xiu-jian to the French Police Station to handle the case. After questioning by the French Police's Western Detective Yang Gaofuski Li, he dispatched detectives Zheng Long, Qi Deqing, and others to first arrest Li Wang-shi (68 years old this year), who had performed the abortion. After questioning, she also admitted to performing</p>
<p>the abortion without denying it.</p>
<p>She stated that the medicinal herb that was inserted was taken out when the fetus was expelled. The detectives then went to the Wanxiangchun Herbal Medicine Store to purchase the dose of labor-inducing medicine that Li Wang-shi bought for Wang Baoshi to take and brought it back to the police station to be tested and verified. Unexpectedly, Wang Dou-shi ultimately succumbed to her illness, and treatment proved ineffective. She died at 6:30 AM yesterday at Huilv Hospital. The hospital notified the French Police Station, and Detective Zhang Chunsheng was dispatched. Dr. Xu Daoheng issued a diagnosis certificate. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall Forensic Examination Office. The deceased's family members are still in</p>
<p>the Yangzhou countryside,</p>
<p>and there are no relatives in Shanghai. The French Police Station reported it to the Special District Court Procuratorate, which dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctor Jiang Xuan and clerk Peng Xu, to the office to examine the body, take their official seats, and begin the official investigation. First, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case. Under questioning, Li Xiu-jian stated that he had known the deceased for only three months. Because she was pregnant, she told him she wanted an abortion. She found Li Wang-shi's residence herself and asked him to accompany her there. Three days later, he went to pick her up. Yesterday, he sent her to the hospital for treatment. Li Wang-shi stated that the deceased and Li came together and requested her to perform an abortion. She refused. She said she had taken three *yuan* worth of</p>
<p>musk, but it was ineffective.</p>
<p>She knelt down and begged her, so she agreed and only gave her labor-inducing medicine and did not insert any medicinal herbs. After verifying the confessions, Prosecutor Wang ruled that Wang Ma, also known as Wang Dou-shi, had indeed died due to the abortion. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to be photographed, coffined, and buried. The diagnosis certificate and proof document were attached to the file. The defendants were taken into custody by the police department to be handled according to the law. After the ruling, Prosecutor Wang and Jiang De-fa, for the sake of caution, dissected the body and conducted a detailed examination. Because the body was offensively rancid, Tongren Fuyuan Hall issued a plank coffin to collect the body, which was transported to the burial ground this morning for burial, pending the arrival of the family members in Shanghai to claim the body. The two defendants, Li Xiu-jian and Wang Li-shi, were taken back to the police station by the patrol officers to be detained, pending their transfer to the Special District Court today for questioning.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Robbers Arrested; Confiscated Jewelry and Firearms; Victim Testifies in Court; Identifies Robbers Present in Court</h3>
<p>Huai Si Police Station Chinese Detective Shang Wu and patrolman Wang You-shan learned that a large gang of robbers was hiding at No. 621 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, plotting illegal activities. At 10:30 AM the day before yesterday, they, along with Western Detective Chief Gibbson and Chinese detectives, secretly went with the French Police's Chinese and Western detectives to the address and successively arrested Dong A-ping from Ningbo, Dong Mao-shi, Wang Xi-gen from Wuxi, Wang Zheng-lin from Yangzhou, Chuan Hai-zhou from Anhui, Li Hui-jun from Pinghu, Wang Shen-shi, and seven others. Items such as pearl necklaces, jewelry, and gold watches were confiscated. They then continued to the investigation at the entrance of the Gongping Hostel at Dongxin Bridge, where they apprehended fellow gang members Zhou Ji-min and Tong Chong-fa from Ningbo, and Wang San-bao, a woman from Suzhou. After taking all ten back to the police station for investigation, it was learned that these individuals were involved in the armed robbery of No. 23, Lane 153, Xiangjiazhui Road on October 17th of last year and the robbery of Yan Xiao-yong's home at No. 10, Lane 231, Qipu Road at noon on March 19th of this year. When questioned, all the defendants initially tried to deny it and refused to admit anything. Later, Tong Chong-fa confessed to participating in the robbery of Yan's house on Qipu Road with Dong A-ping, Wang Xi-gen, Kai Ji-min, and the fugitive Kuang A-liu, and others, and stated that there were firearms hidden at No. 172 Zhaojia Road in Nanshi. After obtaining this information, the Chinese and Western detectives again went with detectives from the Public Security Bureau to confiscate a leather suitcase containing four pistols, 216 bullets, five cartridge clips, a pair of binoculars, ten pieces of solid stone, two small silver ingots, two rings, two pairs of gold bracelets, one large gold fish bead, 21 small beads, as well as silver dollars, and other items. All of the items are stored in the Public Security Bureau, awaiting a formal request for transfer. Yesterday morning, the police station transferred the ten male suspects to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, requesting permission for detention to facilitate investigation. Zhang Tian-yin, the police station's lawyer, then stood up to present the case and submitted the confiscated items as evidence. Yan Xiao-yong, the victim from No. 10, Lane 232, Qipu Road, then filed a report stating that at noon on the 19th of last month, several robbers suddenly broke in. One robber, holding a gun, went upstairs and forced him to the back room downstairs to watch, then proceeded to rob the house. The three tenants, including himself, all suffered losses. He saw one robber holding a gun, who was the first defendant, Tong A-ping, and also identified the pearl necklace, watch, and crab-shaped gold brooch brought to the court by the police as items stolen from his home. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confessions, questioned each defendant, and ordered them to remain in custody pending further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Extortion Case; Suddenly Claims There Is Another Defendant; Clearly Agreed Upon After the Fact; Further Investigation Set for Later Date</h3>
<p>Chen Guo-lin from Yancheng, because at 9 PM on the 26th of last month, he went to No. 66 Fulu Lane, Yangshupu Road, and attempted to extort twenty *yuan* from his fellow villager Lu Xiang-fang on some pretext. As a result, he obtained eight *yuan* by deception. Lu Xiang-fang's elder brother, Lu Xiang-qi, reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station. The arrest was unsuccessful until 11 AM the day before yesterday, when Chinese patrolman Hou Fu-lin checked his identity at the China Soap Factory and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First District Court. Gong Bu Ju lawyer Li Zhi-shan stated that the case originated because the victim, Lu Xiang-fang, works at the Donghua Textile Factory during the day shift. Zhou, a Zhenjiang native, works the night shift at the same factory. His wife, Ren-shi, has a relationship with Lu Xiang-fang. The defendant learned of this. At the time, Lu and Ren-shi were whispering intimately in the room. The defendant broke in and said, "You are engaging in such improper behavior and must report it to the police. Pay twenty *yuan* to avoid trouble." Ren-shi, in desperation, broke off a piece of a gold bracelet and pawned it at the Changxing Pawnshop at No. 2174, on the same road, for eight *yuan*, which she handed over. Lu wrote an IOU for the remaining amount to be paid later. On the 28th, the defendant went again to demand payment. His brother, Lu Xiang-qi, learned of the details and, finding that the defendant lived at No. 40 in the same lane, reported it to the police station. He then fled, claiming he was trying to mediate a settlement. Yesterday at the police station, Lu Xiang-qi suddenly claimed that the defendant was not the person, but another Chen Gui-lin, who was taller, had a shaved head, and looked different. However, the age, height, and appearance that he had reported at the time were all consistent with Chen Guo-lin. Clearly, both sides had reached an agreement after the fact, and the defendant dared to go to the soap factory and work as usual after being arrested. The victim, Lu Xiang-fang, also failed to appear in court. Only his brother-in-law came to court. Lu Xiang-qi stated that there was another Chen Gui-lin living at No. 40 in the same lane as the defendant, who was currently on the run, and that the person currently in custody was indeed different in appearance and stature and could not be fingerprinted. Huang Ren-shi, however, claimed that she had no improper relationship with Lu Xiang-fang, that the defendant had not come to expose them at the time, and that the gold bracelet was borrowed by Lu. She gave evasive answers. The defendant stated that his name was Chen Guo-lin and that there was no Chen Gui-lin living with him. He had been living there for over a year and had not attempted to extort Lu Xiang-fang, firmly denying the charges. Judge Wu Ze-han ruled that he would remain in custody, and a further investigation would be scheduled to determine the facts.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbery with Toy Gun; Two Robbers Sentenced to One Year and Nine Months Each</h3>
<p>Pan Jin-qi and Lu Tao-sheng, natives of Songjiang, living in a flat in a private house on Guiyang Road, were originally carpenters. Recently, they were unemployed and living in poverty. At 9:15 PM on the 23rd of last month, they used a toy gun and an axe near a dark place, attempting to rob Cai Shao-qing, a native of Taizhou, of his property. The robbery was unsuccessful. Yangshupu Police Station Detective Liu Chang-gen arrested them, along with the weapons, and brought them to the police station, where they were sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shu-zhi continued the trial in court. Gong Bu Ju lawyer Li Zhi-shan stated that, after investigation, the two defendants had no other prior offenses and requested sentencing. Both Pan and Lu confessed that they were extremely impoverished, had no money to return home, and resorted to this desperate measure, begging for leniency. Judge Jiang sentenced Pan Jin-qi and Lu Tao-sheng each to one year and nine months in prison. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the prison term at a rate of two days of detention equaling one day of imprisonment. The toy gun and axe were confiscated.</p>

<p>In order to expand the fundraising campaign, the headquarters of the General Team of the Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Team of the Chinese Aviation Association has decided to directly solicit members from all sectors of the city and raise funds for national aviation salvation.

<p>Since the hotel industry began soliciting donations for national aviation salvation last year, the results have been excellent. The donations collected each month have been published in newspapers by the headquarters of the General Team. It is reported that the trade association, due to the lack of effort by a small number of hotels, convened an expanded fundraising committee a few days ago to discuss ways to improve fundraising efficiency. Fundraising committee members Sun Qiuping, Chen Wenda, Xu Wenzhao, Yao Songnian, Zhan Wenxi, Gu Jiemei, Li Jiemei, Zhang Renliang, Yao Zhaoji, Chen Yuanling, Cai Rucai, Cai Genyue, and others attended. Zhang Yuliang, Li Jimin, Zhu Shengyang, and Lu Zhangyan of the General Team headquarters were present to report. Chairman Chen Wenda reported that most hotels in the industry have worked very hard to collect donations for national aviation salvation since the beginning of the campaign. However, there are still a small number of hotels that have not worked hard enough and should be persuaded to work hard to collect donations as soon as possible in order to achieve the original target and complete the mission as soon as possible. After that, the following resolutions were discussed and adopted: (1) The dozens of hotels that have not worked hard in fundraising will be divided into two districts, the Public Concession and the French Concession, to conduct fundraising. Chen Wenda, Xu Wenzhao, Yao Songnian, Zhang Renliang, Sun Qiuping, and Zhan Wenxi were appointed to be responsible for liaison in the Public Concession. Yao Zhaoji, Chen Yuanling, Cai Rucai, and Ren Heshan were appointed to be responsible for liaison in the French Concession. (2) It was decided that the 12th, 13th, and 14th of this month will be the days for the expanded fundraising drive. All committee members present will join the inspectors and staff of the General Team headquarters to set out to fundraise.</p>
<h3>4th Railway Exhibition; Qingdao Sales Office Increases Booth Space; Ministry of Railways Approves Additional 50 Booths</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Ministry of Railways has held national railway line product exhibitions and set up sales offices to promote the development and sale of domestic goods. The original purpose was to increase the effectiveness of the exhibition and promote domestic products on the ground. This time, it is planned to hold the 4th Railway Exhibition in Qingdao. Since the start of registration, manufacturers from all over the country have actively participated, and the quota has been filled. As a result, those who arrived late could not participate. The Joint Association of Domestic Goods Manufacturers along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, in view of the fact that the Ministry of Railways stipulated that the number of manufacturers along the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou-Yong Railways participating was too small and the booth space was insufficient, and that many of the large factories of the association's members were left out due to the quota being filled, specially telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to increase the booth space by 50 booths to facilitate them and show universality and so on. According to the Ministry of Railways' reply yesterday, the manufacturers of the association have a special relationship with the railway side, and it should be approved to increase the booth space by 50 booths to show special accommodation. The two railway administrations will be notified to handle this matter. The association's office is located at 602 Fengjili, Guizhou Road. The manufacturers in this city who go there to register and participate are very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Affected by the Completion of the Wusong River Dredging; Yellow Panic Occurs; Manure Boats Cannot Export Due to Traffic Obstruction; Cleaning Workers Jointly Petition the Authorities</h3>
<p>Since the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission built dams at Yujidun and other places to dredge the Wusong River, manure boats have been affected by traffic, causing an unprecedented yellow panic in Zhabei. The city's cleaning workers petitioned the authorities again yesterday to oppose the ban on collecting fees. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Completion Affects Boat Traffic</p>
<p>The Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission built dams at Yujidun and other places to dredge the Wusong River, cutting off traffic. Rice boats in North Shanghai were the first to be affected and had to detour through the outer Huangpu River. However, manure boats in Zhabei are usually purchased daily by farmers from Huangdu, Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, and other places in small boats. These small boats are not convenient for detouring through the outer Huangpu River. Now, affected by the broken dam, Zhabei manure cannot be exported, causing an unprecedented yellow panic. The Zhabei Cleaning Workers' Union has submitted a request to the Finance and Health Bureaus, urging them to find a solution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Occupations Petition to Allow Fee Collection</p>
<p>Since the An Gong Society and the Health Bureau jointly announced in February that manure collectors would be banned from collecting monthly fees from residents, cleaning workers in various districts of Shanghai, including South Shanghai, North Shanghai, and Hongkou, have relied on the wine money given by users as their only income. The authorities have not formulated a relief plan, but instead banned them, affecting the workers' livelihoods. They have repeatedly petitioned the authorities, but without result. Yesterday, cleaning workers' unions from the first district (South Shanghai), the fourth district (Hongkou), the seventh district (Xiangyan Bridge), and the sixth district (Zhabei) specially sent representatives to the city party headquarters to petition for relief. The authorities promised to reply with concrete measures on the 6th.</p>
<p>Delayed Wage Payment Causes Dispute</p>
<p>There are more than 200 cleaning workers in Zhabei District, who are employed by the Zhabei Cleaning Office. Each worker's wage is at most 8.5 yuan per month. According to the usual practice, each person can borrow 3 yuan on the 16th of each month, and the rest is paid off on the 4th of the following month. The cleaning office has delayed paying this month's wages, so all the workers are panicked. Representatives were sent to negotiate, but there was no result. The cleaning office said that the ships have been blocked by traffic in recent days, the exports have been cut off, and the business is light. It promised to pay the arrears on the 10th. However, the workers (1) believe that their income will be sharply reduced during the period when ships are cut off, and (2) are panicked about their lives, so they all expressed opposition and planned to request the authorities to find a way to provide relief.</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Murder Case on Haichang Road: It Turns Out to Be an Affair; The Son's Detailed Confession</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd of this month, at about 7:00 PM, the house of Yang Wenxiang, located at 18 Ruyi Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei, was attacked by thugs who fired a volley of bullets, killing Yang's wife and daughter, as well as four of the thugs. This was reported in the newspapers. It is now known that after the case occurred, Ruan Kaiji, the director of the Xinzha Sub-bureau, summoned Yu Zhu, the second landlord of the house, and Kou Dizi, the young daughter of the deceased Yang Ji. Yu Zhu confessed that she was 47 years old and from Pudong. My husband is in a small business and is not often at home. I live in the front building, and Yang Wenxiang lives in the back building and the pavilion. There is a reception room downstairs in the back that is rented to someone who makes leather boxes. The day before yesterday evening, I was washing dishes in my room when I suddenly heard the sound of gunfire. I was so scared that I shrank into a ball. After the gunfire stopped, I heard Yang Wenxiang's young daughter Kou Dizi shout that someone was killed. I crawled out and saw Yang Wenxiang's wife, his eldest daughter Kouzi, and a man, all lying dead in a pool of blood on the floor. I don't know if the man usually came to his house or not, but yesterday (that is, the day before) I heard Yang Ji scolding her eldest daughter Kouzi, and the man didn't allow her to scold her. Kou Dizi confessed that she was 15 years old. The day before yesterday evening, Sun Jingyu (referring to the thug) came to my house. My mother scolded my sister, and Sun didn't allow my mother to scold her. At that time, I was standing next to my mother, and my sister was standing opposite. When the Sun surname saw that my mother didn't listen to him, he shot my mother. After my sister was killed, he killed himself, and I dared to come out. The Sun surname often came to my house, and was in love with my sister. My mother knew about it, and because she didn't want it, she told my sister not to be with the Sun surname. Yang Wenxiang confessed that he was 43 years old and that he shaved heads at the Shanghai Bank. He went out at 6:00 AM every day and came back at 7:00 or 8:00 PM, so he didn't know anything about the affairs at home. He only found out about what happened last night after his young daughter and neighbors told him. After the examiner Wang Chongren verified the confession, he determined that the case was indeed caused by Sun Jingyu, who killed Yang Ji because she prevented her eldest daughter Yang Kouzi from having an affair with the Sun surname. Sun had already committed suicide, so the details of the interrogation were reported to the general bureau for investigation. It is also known that the body of the thug was collected by the local security guard yesterday. The husband of the deceased Yang Ji was also summoned to the Shanghai Local Court for questioning yesterday.</p>

<h3>After the Robbery Case on Qipu Road Was Solved, Feng Xiangbing Was Actually Encountered on the Road</h3>
<p>Ge Bosen, a Western detective from the Public Concession Huishi Police Station, and Shang Wu, a Chinese detective, captured seven habitual thieves who robbed a family surnamed in Qipu Road No. 10. According to their confession, the pistols used were rented from Feng Xiangbing, a Yong person residing at No. 172 Zhaojiabang Road in the city, by the captured thief Zhou Jimin. Zhou arranged for transportation, and returned them after use. The Chinese and Western detectives secretly went to the house with the Public Security Bureau the night before, but Feng was not at home. Zhou identified him, and four pistols and two hundred and sixteen bullets (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly wrote one hundred and sixteen bullets) and stolen goods were seized. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Liu Yunfang, the police chief in charge, considered that there were bandits hiding in his jurisdiction and privately hiding a large number of weapons, which was extremely bold and reckless. He investigated that the guarantor for the rental of the house by the bandit Feng was Tang Awu, a waiter at the Dafugui Restaurant, who had stamped the guarantee. He immediately summoned Tang Awu to the case and ordered him to find the bandit Feng Xiangbing and bring him to justice. Tang was handed over to the 16th Pu Detective Brigade to find him all day long. It was not until 7:00 PM yesterday evening that the bandit Feng was walking in 16th Pu, and was encountered face to face on the road. Tang recognized him and arrested him and brought him to the 16th Pu Sub-bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Second Special Court Reduces Salaries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court and the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch have recently reduced salaries for March due to financial difficulties. Except for employees whose salaries are less than 100 yuan, which are still paid as before, the remaining employees are paid 70% for those with salaries of 100 yuan or more, 65% for those with salaries of 300 yuan or more, and 60% for those with salaries of 400 yuan or more. It is reported that this salary reduction is unprecedented since the national crisis. Although the judicial income of the court is less than that of the First Special District, the number of lawsuits has increased greatly, especially civil cases. Judging from the income and expenditure of the local court, the income and expenditure can still offset each other. The total deficit of the high and local courts is also very limited. However, because the Second Special District Prison was taken back, the monthly expenses are burdened with more than 17,000 yuan, and the detention center also needs 3,000 yuan. Therefore, the deficit is very large. Although the Ministry of Judicial Administration still subsidizes 20,000 yuan per month, it is only enough to offset the expenses of the prison and detention center. As a result, the employees of the two courts are all complaining.</p>
<h3>Qianli Steamer Aground in the Huangpu River After Flooding</h3>
<p>The Qianli steamer of Zhengji Steamship Company was damaged in the Huangpu River yesterday morning. The hull was broken and flooded. The ship has now run aground for rescue and is ready for major repairs at the factory. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Empty Boat Floods</p>
<p>The Qianli steamer of Zhengji Company is the company's largest steamer, with a load capacity of 2,913 tons. It originally sailed to Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and various ports in South China. This time, it arrived in Shanghai from North China and unloaded its cargo. It was scheduled to sail empty to Qingdao yesterday morning to load coal. At 5:10 AM yesterday morning, the Qianli steamer sailed from Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it reached the Huangpu River in front of the Zhabei Hydropower Plant in the Wusongkou, the bow of the Qianli steamer suddenly sank into the river. The shipowner was informed and immediately went to the bow to inspect. He saw that the bow had been flooded to six feet in a short time, and the situation was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Self-Grounding</p>
<p>At this time, the shipowner was very frightened and did not know the cause of the flooding in the bow. Seeing the bow sinking, he was deeply concerned about the occurrence of major dangers. In order to seek rescue, he immediately drove the Qianli steamer to the shallow beach near the Zhabei Hydropower Plant and made it ground itself to avoid the danger of the hull being flooded. At the same time, the shipowner sent someone to report to the company on Tianzhutang Street and reported to the Maritime Bureau and the Insurance Federation to send someone to inspect the ship.</p>
<p>Verifying Damage</p>
<p>At noon, Zhengji Company received this report and immediately reported it to the Maritime Bureau and the Insurance Federation according to the shipowner's report and asked ship inspector Cao Shulian to go to the vicinity of the Zhabei Hydropower Plant to inspect the ship. By the afternoon, Mr. Cao had verified that there was a hole on the left side of the bottom of the bow compartment of Qianli, which was three inches long and half an inch wide. River water entered from here. It is not known when the hole was broken. The company has now decided to temporarily use a plugging method to fill the hole in the bottom of the ship, and then pump out the water and tow it out of the shallows.</p>
<p>Factory Repair</p>
<p>After the Qianli accident, Zhengji Company immediately telegraphed its Yantai head office and notified the Qingdao branch. When a reporter from this newspaper inquired at the company, Mr. Liang of the company said that the shipowner did not know how the Qianli was damaged. Fortunately, it was discovered in the Huangpu River, so it was easy to repair. It has now been decided to fill the hole in the bottom of the ship and then tow it into the shipyard for repairs.</p>
<h3>Killed for One Yuan; Two Fists Cannot Beat Four Hands; Qu Fuqing Died at the Hands of Two Gaos</h3>
<p>Qu Fuqing (52 years old), a native of Liuhe, Pudong, who lived at 52 Huayuan Shiqiao Road, had two small cars for rent. Gao Jianglang and Gao Xiaogou, two brothers from Chongming who lived across the street, rented a car from Qu for one yuan a month. By the end of last month, they owed six yuan in rent, which had not been paid for a long time. Recently, they also reported that the car was lost. At 9:30 PM the night before last, Qu Fuqing asked Gao Jianglang for the car rent again. The Gao brothers not only refused to pay, but also spoke rudely. So a quarrel broke out. Gao Jianglang rushed forward, twisted Qu and beat him. Gao Xiaogou also helped his brother press Qu down and punched him hard. Qu was old after all, and two fists could not beat four hands. He was beaten and injured. At that time, people persuaded them to disperse. Unexpectedly, after Qu Fuqing returned home, he held his lower abdomen with both hands and called out in pain. He died at 1:00 AM that night. His wife reported to the police station, and the police were sent to arrest him. The culprits had already fled after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, the local security guard Lu Shunlong reported to the local court to request an autopsy. The order was to wait for someone to be sent for the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Three Suicide Attempts by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Zhao Yunshan, about twenty years old, who ran a printing business at No. 126, Yanqing Lane, Guizhou Road, in a street-facing pavilion room, and his wife, Ms. Chen, about eighteen years old, contemplated suicide due to financial difficulties yesterday. The couple simultaneously ingested raw opium. Neighbors noticed and rushed them to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the rescue was timely, and they were saved. At the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, around 9 PM the night before, a Western-dressed traveler, claiming to be Wang Chunlin, a local of thirty years old, booked room 596. Somehow, he secretly swallowed a large amount of opium at midnight. The room attendant discovered him unconscious and reported to the front desk, who then reported to the Old North Station Police. Detectives arrived and summoned an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital. It was said that he had taken an overdose of poison, and his life was in danger.</p>
<p>Chen Hongqing, a traveler from Ningbo, about thirty years old, was in room 210 of the Ningbo Merchant Hotel at No. 296 Tianjin Road. Due to prolonged unemployment and inability to make a living, he contemplated suicide. He wrote a suicide note and swallowed poison after 10 PM last night. The room attendant discovered him and reported to the nearby Old Zha Police Station, who sent detective No. 339 to take him to Renji Hospital.</p>

Yesterday, Mr. Katen, the Chairman of the Greek Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, and Mr. Smith, the Postmaster of Hankou, sent letters, expressing their admiration for the Great Sage and Teacher's advocacy of universal harmony, which guides people in their conduct and brings safety to the world. However, its profound meaning has not been realized. This conference's request for Master Duan to explain the true Dharma of universal harmony will surely inspire peace, allowing disasters and evil to be transformed subtly. They deeply believe and strongly support it.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders Provinces and Cities to Promote Literacy Education, with Labor Service as the Center of School and Public Education to Change the Previous Lazy, Scattered, Selfish Bad Habits</h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) Chairman Chiang issued an order on the 1st to all provinces and cities to promote literacy education, so that students and citizens alike can recognize labor as their duty, service as their vocation, and prepare for universal compulsory labor. The original order stated: "National rejuvenation, education is the most important task. In addition to the predetermined political work this year, all provinces should pay special attention to education. Provincial chairmen and education commissioners must do their best to implement the promotion and popularization methods. If adults can teach children to read, those with knowledge can teach those with less knowledge, all with a spirit of duty and mutual assistance, to improve people's intelligence and morality, and continue to work hard, the effect of a month will surely be achieved. In particular, in addition to training citizens and improving their spirit and life according to the requirements of the New Life Movement, such as neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, speed, and certainty, labor and service must be the center of school education and public education, so that students and citizens alike can recognize labor as their duty, service as their vocation, change the previous lazy, scattered, selfish bad habits, and strive to be healthy citizens. In this way, with educational methods, publicizing the spirit, the people will be able to persuade each other to work and happily serve the country and society, which is also a preparation for universal compulsory labor. In addition to separate orders, I hope you will earnestly follow and implement it." (2nd)</p>
<h3>After the Loss of Rare Books from the Changshu Library, Qian Xijin Has Returned a Portion</h3>

<p>The Central Propaganda Committee is paying extraordinary attention to the books stored in this county. Upon hearing of the missing books, Zhao was immediately sent to Changshu for a secret investigation. He has advocated a thorough investigation and has wired the county office to handle it. Since Qian's detention, he has returned to the library five major manuscripts that he had given to a certain gentleman in Suzhou: Haiyu Thief Chaos Record, San Wu Shu, Du Qing Pavilion Poetry and Lyrics Excerpts, Ruxianghua Pavilion Collection, and Kanmei Ji You Excerpts. It has been discovered that two other individuals, including Chen, are also involved and will be detained for investigation simultaneously.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Chinese Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Broadcasted yesterday on Children's Day at the Central Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>Today is Children's Day. All our fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters throughout the country should bless the children of the entire nation and, at the same time, speak out for their rights.</p>
<p>We know that the so-called "Rights of Man" (simply put, "Human Rights") had already been recognized by the laws of France and America by the end of the 18th century, the time of the French and American Revolutions, because they incorporated the so-called "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" or the "Bill of Rights" into their revolutionary constitutions. By the end of the 19th century, many other countries had also accepted the theories of the French and American revolutionary eras in their constitutions or other legal codes. However, by and large, the efforts of civilized humanity during the 18th and 19th centuries focused on the rights and welfare of adults. Even in civilized nations, the rights that children should enjoy in the family and in society had not yet received adequate attention.</p>
<p>However, Rousseau, the great French thinker who most strongly advocated human rights theories in the 18th century, did not speak solely for adults. In his "Social Contract," Rousseau had already argued for the rights of all mankind. In his famous work "Emile," he argued even more specifically for the rights of children. He was not only a political thinker but also an educator. His basic views were: first, most of a person's life is determined during childhood; most of a person's happiness is created or destroyed during childhood. Second, children's education should be scientific. His "Social Contract" is known as the draft of the "Declaration of the Rights of Man," and his "Emile" is also known as the "Declaration of the Rights of Children."</p>
<p>In recent times, Rousseau's theories have gradually gained public recognition, and the importance of children's issues has become universally acknowledged. We often hear people say, "The 20th century should be a century for children." Now that a third of the 20th century has passed, we can see what achievements modern progressive countries have made in their efforts to promote child welfare and use them as a reference.</p>
<p>Children's Education</p>
<p>In general, in modern countries, the period of compulsory education for children is roughly from the ages of six or seven to fourteen. Some countries have recently extended the age of compulsory education to secondary school age, i.e., sixteen years old (e.g., England) or even eighteen years old (e.g., France and some American states). This is a kind of progress that people in the 18th and 19th centuries could not have dreamed of. This is one.</p>
<p>Children's Health</p>
<p>In order to protect children's health, in recent years - especially in the last one or two decades - many countries have established many new systems and adopted many new methods, such as special protection for pregnant women and mothers, compulsory prevention of diseases such as smallpox and diphtheria, control of milk and other children's foods, strict school health inspections, and promotion of children's health knowledge. The result has been a sharp decrease in infant mortality rates in various countries. For example, in England, the infant mortality rate has been reduced by half in the short span of the last three or four decades (in 1883, the mortality rate per thousand children was 146; in 1927, it was 70). This is two.</p>
<p>Relief for Orphaned and Destitute Children</p>
<p>In many countries, orphaned and destitute children used to rely almost entirely on private charitable organizations for relief. Now, this has gradually changed to state relief. Germany after the European War is the most obvious example. The legal status of illegitimate children has also greatly improved in recent years, or even become completely equal to that of legitimate children. Russia is an obvious example. This is also a revolution in traditional legal concepts. This is three.</p>
<p>Protection of Child Labor</p>
<p>In the early stages of the Industrial Revolution in Europe, children were the biggest victims. For example, the conditions of child laborers in British textile factories in the early 19th century and in Chinese silk and yarn factories today are so miserable that people simply cannot imagine them without experiencing them firsthand. Now, in general, countries have prohibited children under the age of fourteen from working in factories. The International Labor Conference has also incorporated this restriction into international conventions. Young people from the age of fourteen to around twenty-one are also subject to various protections under the labor laws of various countries. This is four.</p>
<p>Children's Crime</p>
<p>In general, progressive countries have adopted the following two policies in recent years regarding children's crime: first, raising the age of criminal responsibility. In the past, even very young children could be regarded as criminals and held criminally liable. For example, Roman law recognized that children over the age of seven could become criminals. Now, many countries' criminal laws still consider children under the age of seventeen or eighteen to be only partially criminally responsible. Second, the establishment of juvenile courts. Now, many countries use only education and not punishment to correct delinquent children, and only special juvenile courts are used to try them, not ordinary courts. This is five.</p>
<p>The above are only a few of the most salient points, but even these few points can give a glimpse of the achievements of modern countries in their efforts to address children's issues. Today, when we speak out for the children of the entire nation, all of the above issues should naturally be taken into consideration. However, since my role is in the field of education, I would like to say a few more words about the education of Chinese children.</p>
<p>I have previously spoken on this radio station that in the past twenty years or so of the Republic of China, in terms of the number of students, our higher education has expanded a hundredfold, secondary education has expanded eightfold, but primary education has only expanded fourfold. In the first year of the Republic of China, the number of primary school students was over 2.7 million; in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, it was still only over 11 million. These figures show that our education has not been fully extended to children in the primary school stage.</p>
<p>Recently, public opinion in the country has gradually focused on the elimination of illiteracy, which is indeed an important task, because the existence of a large number of illiterate people can make it difficult to promote all material construction work and to implement all spiritual construction work (such as instilling national consciousness and completing civic training). However, in order to eliminate illiteracy, on the one hand, all young people or adults who have passed the age of primary school should receive a minimal amount of supplementary education. On the other hand, all school-age children must receive a minimal amount of compulsory education. Compared to the two, the latter is more important than the former, because if compulsory primary education cannot be popularized, the source of illiteracy cannot be cut off. Even if current illiterate people can receive some kind of supplementary education, illiterate people will still continue to emerge. Therefore, our future efforts must especially focus on the compulsory education of school-age children. The population of our country is commonly estimated to be 400 million. School-age children (assumed to be six to twelve years old) are commonly estimated to account for one-tenth of the total population, i.e., 40 million people. As mentioned earlier, the number of school-age children currently in school is approximately 12 million. The number of school-age children who have not been able to enroll in school is approximately 28 million. How can we ensure that these 28 million or more school-age children all receive a minimal amount of compulsory education? This is our current serious problem.</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we must first decide on the minimum length of compulsory education. Recently, the government's assumption and the public's advocacy seem to recognize that the period of compulsory education should be set at four years. However, a four-year compulsory education system cannot be achieved in one step. Therefore, the government plans to gradually increase the length of compulsory education from one year to four years. The implementation of compulsory education can therefore be divided into several phases. The period from 1935 to 1939 can be set as the first phase. During these five years, various places can gradually implement compulsory education for school-age children, and the duration of compulsory education can be temporarily set at one year, ensuring that by the end of 1939, one year of compulsory education has been popularized in all provinces and cities across the country. Next, the period from 1940 to 1944 will be designated as the second phase. At that time, the period of compulsory education for school-age children can be changed to two years. During these five years, two years of compulsory education must be gradually popularized in various provinces and cities. Further, compulsory education may be directly changed to four years to achieve the expected standard.</p>
<p>As for the teacher problem, on the one hand, we must add primary school teacher training institutions for the purpose of adding primary schools. But if we also (1) strictly implement the system of industry-department compilation, (2) fully implement the number of students in existing schools, and (3) improve private schools, there are still many existing teachers and school buildings that can be utilized. If we also adopt (4) the itinerant teaching system (i.e., setting up itinerant teachers) and (5) the teaching assistant system, the need for new teachers can also be greatly reduced. What is most difficult may still be the funding problem. However, if each child receives one year of compulsory education, if it is handled properly, the national expenditure should be no more than five yuan. If so, then making the current 28 million out-of-school school-age children receive one year of compulsory education will cost no more than 140 million yuan. If, as mentioned earlier, five years are used as the period for popularizing one year of compulsory education, the annual amount required is less than 30 million yuan. If this fee is further shared by the local and central governments - if the local government bears two-thirds and the central government subsidizes one-third - then even if both central and local finances are difficult, there should be a way to set it up. If we look at the central government's finances, the total expenditure for this year is approximately 800 million yuan, and the expenditure on central education is only about 3%. If another one-eightieth (10 million yuan) of the total expenditure is transferred to be used for the above-mentioned</p>
<p>the work of compulsory education can definitely be done. In short, the popularization of compulsory primary education is a very serious issue. On the one hand, we must not take it lightly, underestimate the complexity and difficulty of this problem. At the same time, we must not see it as too difficult, and especially must not be too afraid of difficulties. Our central and local governments, especially those in the country who are engaged in education, should, from now on, make up their minds, persevere, and promote and complete this great work of national rejuvenation, ensuring that the term "compulsory education" immediately breaks away from the stage of propaganda and enters the stage of implementation. As long as we have the determination and work hard, the recent examples of the Soviet Union and Poland can give us great encouragement, because these countries were in a situation similar to ours a few years ago in terms of the number of illiterate people.</p>
<p>The government has recently announced that the academic year of 1935 (August 1935 to July 1936) is China's Children's Year. We earnestly hope that everyone will work together to make our Children's Year the year in which compulsory primary education in China truly begins to be implemented.</p>

<h3>China Wins International Volleyball Championship; Defeats Russia 41 to 25 in Last Night's Finals; Qiu Guangxie's Spiking like Cannonballs Stuns the Audience</h3>
<p>The international volleyball tournament (international style) organized by the YMCA included teams from China, Russia, the United States, and the Jewish community, playing in a single round-robin format. The Chinese and Russian teams had successively defeated the United States and the Jewish community. Last night's final match at 7:30 PM drew a full house, marking the YMCA volleyball tournament's first grand occasion. The Chinese and Russian teams were strong, making for a very intense competition. After losing the first set, the Chinese team was fortunate to have effective teamwork and defense. Qiu Guangxie's fierce spiking helped them win two consecutive sets, reversing the defeat with a score of two to one and winning the championship. In the other match, the United States defeated the Jewish community. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>China 52—14 Eleven to Fifteen Fifteen to Three Fifteen to Seven Russia</p>
<p>United States 28—41 Eleven to Fifteen Fifteen to Two Fifteen to Eleven Jewish</p>
<p>First Set</p>
<p>After the China-Russia match began, the atmosphere in the hall suddenly became tense. Russia displayed fierce momentum, scoring two consecutive points. China responded in kind, scoring four points. Soon after, the Russian team added two more points, and China immediately evened the score at six to six. The back-and-forth play was extremely balanced. Russian team captain Bulo Gufei's spiking was exceptionally fierce, while Chinese player Qiu Guangxie's spikes were like thunder, impossible to defend against. Coupled with Chen Zongqi's skillful setting, the combination was seamless. They once took the lead with a score of ten to seven. Unexpectedly, their formation became disorganized later on, and the Russian team seized the opportunity, winning the first set with a score of fifteen to eleven.</p>
<p>[Photo caption] The Chinese Championship Team of the Shanghai International Volleyball Tournament (from right to left, back row): Li Yaohua, Tan Lijian, Coach Chen Bingde, Zheng Yiquan, Mai Bingyao; (front row) Chen Zongqi, Captain Qiu Gengxie, Wei Dingyi, Zhou Dayun (Huifang Photo)</p>
<p>Second Set</p>
<p>After suffering a minor setback, the Chinese team rallied and strengthened its morale. With Qiu Guangxie, Chen Zongqi, and Wei Dingyi in the front, Chen set the ball in the middle, and Qiu and Wei launched attacks from the left and right. The heavy, cannonball-like spikes made it impossible for the opponent to defend, earning continuous cheers from the audience. With stable ball retrieval, the Chinese team scored eight consecutive points. The Russian team was flustered and at a loss. The Chinese team's momentum grew stronger, and when they reached fifteen points, the Russian team had only scored three.</p>
<p>Third Set</p>
<p>After each team won a set, the competition in the third set became even more intense. At this critical juncture, with the championship on the line, China scored two consecutive points. Since both losing and serving the ball do not award points, they were cautious and strived for the right to serve. Russia managed to add two points. Afterward, China took the lead with a score of six to two. After Russia earned the serve and added two points, the serve returned to China. Russian player Bulo Gufei tried hard to spike, but all of his attempts were cleverly blocked by Chinese players Qiu Guangxie and Chen Zongqi. Qiu Guangxie used his ape-like arm to spike and scored four consecutive points. The Russian team called a timeout to boost their morale, but it was to no avail. After twelve to four, the teams held on for a long time, with neither side willing to give up. Although the Russian team managed to gain three points, they were ultimately defeated by China with a score of fifteen to seven, and China won the championship. The lineups were as follows:</p>

<h3>Open Handball: Sun Jialu Gets Off to a Flying Start; Defeats Tota Men 2 to 0; Bao Shanli Suffers Unexpected Defeat</h3>
<p>The second open handball singles tournament began at 6 PM yesterday. Sun Jialu, a new talent from our country, made his debut and surprisingly made a name for himself, defeating Tota Men in two straight sets of 21 to 9, 21 to 9. It can be said that he got off to a flying start and has a promising future. The most surprising event was that Bao Shanli suffered an unexpected blow, losing 1 to 2 to Pian Si.

<h3>Finance: Gold Price Fluctuates Throughout the Day—Result: No Change—</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was calm. The central bank continued to sell wheat, and the exchange rate rose again after gathering momentum, but the upward trend was blocked, and it once fell below the 70 yuan mark. However, sellers were not strong, and the short positions were slightly covered when the price was low. In the end, the market was extremely calm.

The customs gold unit rose by 1.9 percent, and the standard gold price rose again to 909 yuan and 70 cents, starting a high market.

It was anticipated that HSBC's official exchange rate would rise by 125 for British pounds and 3125 for American dollars, and the price gradually fell back. The central bank sold again, and the domestic market became looser, once falling below the 70 yuan mark. However, because banks took advantage of the low price to buy in and large investors also maintained the price, it was pulled up immediately. There was quite a lot of fluctuation in the middle. Later, Chinese merchants covered their short positions, and the market tightened slightly after the exchange rate became strong, forming an upward trend. However, due to the high pressure of banks selling at high prices and the central bank's sales appetite, the price gradually fell again. However, the market was still calm, and after falling, it turned to fluctuation. At noon, the situation seemed stable, and the afternoon market opened calmly. Small investors saw that the rising trend had stopped again and tended to sell, and large investors took the opportunity to supply, stabilizing and then weakening, and once falling slightly.

Finally, large investors came to buy in slightly, and floating shorts also bought, and the market closed stably. The day's market was calm, and the overall trend fluctuated.

<h3>Securities - The U.S. Stock Exchange Focuses on the Grain Market -</h3>
<p>Sin Fung &amp; Co.'s report yesterday (the 3rd) indicated that the New York stock market was mixed and sluggish, marking the most inactive day in the past ten days. This was due to the lack of momentum in the market. The day's trading was very mediocre, but United States Steel Corporation continued to be under pressure, only to recover later. Today's traders focused on grains. The grain market was buoyed by the rise in corn. The increase in corn was due to the sharp decline in inventory. Because of the strength in grains, the trend of agricultural equipment stocks also turned firm. The bond market was mixed and slightly lower. There was very little fluctuation in small exchange stocks. A brokerage seat on the New York Stock Exchange was sold yesterday for US$6,500, the lowest price since 1919.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Actual Sales Continue and Standard Yarn Prices Continue to Rise -</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be good. Because demand for cotton yarn from the South is very strong, some factories have already run out of stock. The Seventeen Branch yarn of Shenxin Factory even wants to allocate goods. Japanese yarn supplies are also tight, so this is the reason. In general, speculators have no intention of seeing the yarn market weaken for the time being, but Japanese shorts remain unmoved.</p>
<p>Near-term Yarn Prices Up About One Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market this morning, prices for all months trended upwards. Because the current yarn sales market is good, the overseas cotton market is stable, and the Ningbo brokers are buying up空 [empty positions], the market seems tight. However, trading is not active. However, most speculators do not see the cotton yarn market weakening, so business is relatively slow. As a result, prices for all months rose from 5, 6, and 7 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market continued to improve after the afternoon opening. Sellers in the market were scarce, and the near-term market situation became more expensive. Distant months declined slightly. As a result, the near months rose by two or three jiao compared to the morning closing price, and distant months were flat. Sold Da Kee 450 bales, Keng Fong 400 bales, Shen Kee 550 bales, Tai Chang 600 bales, Ta Foo 400 bales, Ta Fong 450 bales, Chang Fong 350 bales. Bought Yu Kang 400 bales, Tong Kee 400 bales, Ta Fook 450 bales, Chang Fong 1,300 bales, Run Kang 350 bales, Yuan Yi 350 bales, Sheng Yuan 550 bales. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>The current yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 1,260 bales throughout the day. The market is stable. The purchase amounts of the various gangs are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 650 Sichuan 120 Inland 100</p>
<p>North Gang 15 Shantou 30 Kaifeng 150</p>

<h3>There Is a Short Squeeze Phenomenon in Cotton This Month</h3>
<p>After the cotton market started strong and then fell, the market situation became more bleak. This is because cotton inventories are too thick, and factories need to reduce consumption. However, some speculators say that there is a short squeeze in the standard cotton for April, so this month alone is strong and up three jiao, but the distant months are lying伏 [dormant], tight, and weak.</p>
<p>Distant Month Cotton Is Dull</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market this morning, all months rose in unison. Because U.S. old cotton fell by 4 to 5 [unclear unit], and new cotton rose by over 10 pounds [unclear unit], and Indian cotton also rose by 1 to 3.25 rupees, people's hearts were挺秀 [strong]. This month's was the strongest. Because there are rumors of a short squeeze in the market, Ta Foo number purchased in large quantities, and the market continued to be拍 [bid] tighter and tighter. However, according to some news, Japanese merchants still抛 [sold] when prices rose. As a result, all months rose by 1.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and this month alone rose by 3.5 jiao. After the afternoon opening, the near-month market was especially strong, but when拍 [bidding] to the distant months, it was relatively flat. As soon as prices were high, the sellers became active. Ta Foo sold again, and foreign cotton news was not good. The price of three-grade cotton fell, and拍 [bid] to the three closing 转 changed to decline. As a result, the bulls this month remained tight and did not let go, and 未動 [did not move]. Distant months fell by 1 to 2 jiao. Sold Ta Foo 3,000 dan, Tong Kee 1,800 dan, Ta Fong 4,300 dan, He Xing 1,000 dan, Yi Chang 1,800 dan, Yi Feng Clean 1,700 dan, Chang He 1,000 dan, Tai Chang 1,800 dan, Yuan Yi 2,700 dan, Run Kang 1,600 dan.

<h3>U.S. New Cotton Rises Strongly Old Cotton Also Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened weak and inactive. Because brokers closed their long positions and foreign firms sold, and the market deeply believed that a certain merchant bought foreign cotton and sold off U.S. cotton to hedge, prices for all months fell slightly from 3 to 10 [unclear unit]. At noon, it was heard that Secretary of Agriculture Wallace stated at a press conference that the cotton processing tax would not increase before August 1. At the same time, reports from Wall Street indicated that the government would soon have effective methods for new cotton. As a result, new cotton rose, and old cotton was able to stabilize. It is said that Liverpool firms are very interested in buying because the difference between new and old cotton is very large. Peers and New Orleans also bought, and shorts covered their positions. There were not many sellers. Holders intend to wait for the development of government policies. The subsequent market price reversed, especially in the near months. At closing, old cotton fell 4 [unclear unit], new cotton rose 10 to 15 [unclear unit], spot prices fell 5 [unclear unit], British cotton spot prices fell 4 points, and futures fell 12 points. Indian cotton rose due to good current demand, short covering, and speculative buying. 平果爾 Ping Guo Er rose 1.25 rupees, 奥姆辣 Aomula rose 1.5 rupees, and 白羅溪 Bai Luoxi rose 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (3rd telegram):</p>

<h3>Manchester Yarn Prices Are Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>A telegram from Manchester on the 3rd stated that there were still many inquiries, but the number of transactions was not large, and market prices were slightly soft. 20-count yarn sold for 9.625 to 10.625 pence, and 30-count yarn sold for 10.625 to 11.625 pence, both down one-eighth of a penny. 40-count yarn sold for 11.625 to 12.625 pence. 60-count Egyptian cotton yarn sold for 15.5 to 16.5 pence, all unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains - Foreign Rice Sales Remain Strong - Both Japonica Rice Arrivals and Sales Are Scarce - American Wheat Has No New Developments -</h3>
<p>Foreign Rice: Sales remain strong, with very strong demand from inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Merchants in this street continued to arrange shipments to Nanjing. Those who囤buy remain steadfast in their intent not to sell. The merchants further bid up prices, and the market continued to rise by varying amounts, from 0.4-0.5 fen to 0.6-0.7 fen. A total of approximately 20,000 bags of Saigon rice were offered throughout the day. Nearly 10,000 bags of various other rices were also offered. 客秈 Ke Xian rice was being eagerly sought by inland merchants. Merchants on this street had limited dealings. The market, therefore, followed the upward trend of foreign rice, but merchants did not insist on high prices. Prices only increased by 0.2-0.3 fen. 2,400 bags of Xiang [Hunan] rice and other rices were sold, mostly to inland merchants.</p>
<p>Japonica Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 20 shipments (totaling over 4,000 shi) arrived in South Shanghai. After the market softened in the previous session, the sales market in this street continued to be desolate due to rain. Furthermore, the包胃 [absorption capacity] has become stagnant after the surge. Only the Yantai帮 [gang, group of traders] dealt with 400-500 bags, so the situation was even softer, and market prices trended downward. It was difficult to sustain the prices of various thick Japonica rices and thin Indica rices. Prices eventually fell back by varying amounts, from 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the hidden variable yuan followed suit, also falling by 0.1-0.2 yuan. There were only 4-5 shipments from various routes north of Shanghai and along the河下 [riverbanks]. 河 River inventories were scarce, and店店 [shops] rarely put goods on the market. Sales in various markets were exceptionally lackluster, and the market price of white Japonica rice turned down by approximately 0.1 yuan. Although the arrival of thin Indica rice was lacking, prices were tired, with a decrease of several fen. The other goods also showed softness.</p>
<p>Chicago</p>
<p>There were no new developments in the wheat market. In the corn market, both arrivals and rural inventories were low. Spot demand showed slight improvement, but it was heard that prices did not rise along with futures.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat April 1st April 2nd Change</p>
<p>May 94.50 95.125 Up 0.625</p>

<h3>Soybean Market Is Quite Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation was quite stable. Due to the oil mill [unclear], prices continued to rise by 0.04-0.05 yuan. Hankou Zha soybeans also rose by 0.06-0.07 yuan from the previous day due to thin bottoms and tight markets. However, since the soy bottom stock is still thick, the market price is stable. Yesterday, it was estimated that there were about 7 or 8 cars of Dalian Pingheng soybeans opened, with a price of 4.15 yuan. 2,000 bags of 德 De soybeans were opened at a price of 3.8 to 3.85 yuan. Two cars of Quan soybeans were opened at prices of 3.7 to 3.71 yuan. Three cars of Bengfu soybeans were opened at a price of 3.35 to 3.3 yuan. 300 bags of Shashi soybeans were opened at a price of 3.48 yuan. 800-900 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans were priced at 3.6 to 4.3 yuan. Over 700 bags of [unclear] soybeans were opened at a price of 3.37 to 3.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Chinese and Japanese Silk Merchants Have Vastly Different Mentalities - Non-Selling Unless Satisfied Price vs. Simply Seeking to Sell and Profit -</h3>
<p>The transaction volume in the local foreign firm silk market is sparse. The main reason is that domestic silk merchants insist on not selling unless they have a satisfactory price. They disregard overseas market trends and still have the same bad mentality as in the past. Japanese silk has gradually shown signs of offering long-滞 [lagging, stale] goods onto the market due to insufficient supply. Therefore, the Yokohama market price is often around 580 yen. They are unwilling to let it rise and also unwilling to let it fall. They are willing to accept even a slightly lower price. This is a key business tip in recent years.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market - Coarse Sand White Also Down Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend still showed no improvement. The guild's grading盤 [price list] called for 17.4 yuan for 24 Coarse Sand White, down 0.05 yuan, but no transactions were made. Re-exported goods were划 [priced] out at 5.3 yuan, with some slight sales. Taitoo Sugar B Mark was called for 18.3 yuan, but no transactions were made. The 本 local factory Mianbai Zhenyu No. 1 was unchanged at 17 yuan. Numbers 2, 3, and 4 were退 [withdrawn]. The Chao gang opened a new arrival of 100+ bags of Gao Qi White at a price of 14.2 yuan. Another opened 200+ bags of Yang White, with higher ones priced at 13.85 yuan, and lower ones from 13.3 to 13 yuan. Chao 青 [blue] was opened sporadically. Tizhuang Qing was 10.08 yuan and Huang [yellow] 清 Qing was 10.04 yuan, unchanged. [Unclear], [Unclear].</p>
<h3>Dried Goods - Raw Peanuts Asking Prices Continue to Be Tight -</h3>
<p>Raw peanuts are getting a bump due to telegraph signals from Qingdao and the price continues to rise. Guandong wholesale dealers have had great luck and so purchased another 100 tons. One-hundred tons of  [Chen] peanuts for 7.25元, several ordinary purchases for 6.80 yuan, and a smaller quantity of purchased peanuts from Feng were also purchased for 7.30元. Market prices continue to remain tight.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shou Ruo)</p>
<p>The more contentment there is in the hearts of all human beings, the less the danger of destruction. Do not believe that the insatiable greed of aggressors poses a danger of being defeated and destroyed by a general assault; the insatiable greed of speculators poses a danger of ruining their reputations and even leading to suicide… The only thing that one can be insatiable about without danger, but rather makes your life secure, is the continuous, in-depth study of knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>It is easy to awaken someone who is simply having a delusional dream; but if they have that dream and also start having complex dreams within dreams, then it is not easy to awaken them! For example, dreaming of getting rich out of thin air is a very simple dream. If you can't get rich, it's easy to wake up. But if, while having a dream of getting rich, you then have a dream within a dream about how you will build a Western-style house, buy a car, and take a concubine after you get rich, then it is difficult to awaken them from their delusion!</p>
<h3>Viewing Things This Way</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingyuan</p>
<p>Casually strolling down the street, or wandering in the sea of people, quietly observing the myriad forms of the common folk is actually more meaningful than visiting a zoo.</p>
<p>In terms of character: some are brave as lions, some are timid as mice, some are greedy as wolves, some are docile as sheep, some are cunning as foxes, some are treacherous as foxes, some are venomous as snakes and scorpions, some are foolish as deer and pigs, some are × as ××... People of all sorts can be symbolized by various animals, and then a phenomenon of various animals active will immediately appear in the mind: some pursue sexual desire, some fight for food; their purpose is nothing more than to solve the problems of food and sex that their nature requires, which is no different from other animals. How can it be called a sin? Only their skills have really surpassed other animals: such as kidnapping, scams, prostitution, body-in-a-box, what adulterous woman kills her husband, what murder for money, etc., none of which can be done by other animals. Is it not more meaningful to watch higher animals actively seeking food and sex than to visit a zoo where animals enjoy food and sex while sitting idly by, their nature submerged?</p>
<p>Humans originally evolved from animals. Being too serious only creates troubles. Viewing things this way, one can be at ease!</p>
<p>Take the author's life as an example: to view it as "sitting on the cold bench" is boring; but if one regards oneself as the "Monkey King," sitting facing south, issuing orders, and jumping around with the little monkeys, it is just like the realm of the Monkey King of Huaguo Mountain in the Journey to the West, is it not delightful! Is it not delightful!</p>
<p>Also, one evening on Penglai Road, I saw a group of men walking around a woman. I thought: if we were to implement Zhang Jingsheng's advocated beautiful nude parade, taking off our clothes completely, under the moonlight, it would be ten thousand times more beautiful than a group of dogs wearing a fur coat chasing a female dog.</p>
<h3>Wang the Blind</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>In our town, no one doesn't know the great name of Wang the Blind. In fact, Wang the Blind is a begging vagrant. Why is it worth remembering him? But this beggar's reputation is too great. Not only does everyone in this town know him, but also people within a radius of dozens of miles know his character.</p>
<p>He begs in the market every first and fifteenth of the month. He must beg a copper coin from each business or household he passes before he will leave. At first, it was very difficult, but after a long time, each family saw him without even stepping onto the stairs and already had a copper coin pinched in their hands waiting for him.</p>
<p>But he is very frugal, saving up the copper coins he begs, and has actually accumulated thousands of yuan. Many small businessmen borrow money from him, and he charges an interest of two and a half cents. In this way, his money is rolling in more and more.</p>
<p>In recent years, he has taken in many "adopted sons." Children from wealthy families are very pampered, while beggars are considered very lowly. The idea is that giving children to beggars to be their sons makes it easy for them to grow up. Every year on the Dragon Boat Festival, he buys many fans and handkerchiefs to give to his adopted sons. People who receive his gifts have to give him one or two silver dollars. So, when he encounters holidays, he always eats his fill of wine and meat. Such a beggar can be praised as a "strange beggar."</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was his sixtieth birthday. Besides many disciples, grandsons, and little beggars, many "parents-in-law" and adopted sons came. He was so anxious that he had no choice but to go to the tavern to book more than a dozen tables of banquets, making a big ruckus. Such a beggar can be praised as a "strange beggar."</p>
<h3>Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Huang Baiying</p>
<p>Pregnancy, this matter, on the journey of women's lives, who can avoid it? Only those women whose physiology has become abnormal.</p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, men always feel it contains infinite mystery. Especially those beautiful young girls, newly married not long ago, suddenly swaying their high bulging bellies as they walk out the door, become the focus of attention for many men who specialize in gossiping about women. In the expressions of their eyebrows and eyes, there seems to be a common exclamation mark of surprise: "How can her belly be so high so quickly!"</p>
<p>Originally, pregnancy is an inevitable phenomenon after men and women are combined, and there is nothing extraordinary about it. However, the reason why women consider it shameful is because of the issue of physical beauty. This is different from the shyness women feel about marriage.</p>
<p>If a woman has already gone through two or one childbirth, pregnancy becomes a very ordinary matter.</p>
<p>A woman who is in the early stages of pregnancy feels uneasy in her daily life, and is also very uneasy in her spirit, because she instinctively anticipates the extreme pain of childbirth.</p>
<p>In the end, is pregnancy a joyful thing or a sad thing?</p>
<p>From my feelings, pregnancy is indeed a sad thing. -- Capitalists who generally hope for sons to carry on the family line are of course an exception. -- If a young couple's wife becomes pregnant, it is certainly unpleasant for the wife, and even more distressing for the husband. Young people are in the golden age of enjoying love. If there is a son in the middle, then the love between men and women often changes, even breaks down. Moreover, with a son, a sum of money for infant expenses must be added to the already unmanageable living expenses!</p>
<p>Many opinions are consistent: young people should not get pregnant. However, who can think of a safe way to stop this physiological necessity? No, right? It's never possible!</p>
<p>Terrible pregnancy! Terrible pregnancy!</p>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Nighttime Talk of a Miserable Life, Originally a Dream; Scattered Footprints, the Wind and Rain are Too Oppressive.</p>
<p>Huanhua said: What are you laughing at? You all benefited from me. You know, I've been extremely poor these past few days. What else can I do if I don't find some money to use? It's raining today, and I'm not going back. I'll use this room for another day. The tea house attendant laughed: I didn't say anything, you're the one babbling on. Why bother asking for a room? Just move next door and save the money. Huanhua said: Don't talk nonsense. I'm staying here to be a matchmaker for Mr. Jia, and for no other reason. The tea house attendant said: Are you talking about that young lady who came from the west? It's already seven or eight tenths settled. What do you need to do as a matchmaker? Huanhua smiled: At the rate you guys are going, when would it succeed? One word from me, and you'll be drinking wedding wine right away. Before the two words "wedding wine" could be finished, someone outside was already chiming in: Wedding wine will definitely be drunk. As he spoke, the man had already walked in, repeatedly clasping his hands to him and saying: Congratulations, congratulations! Huanhua looked and saw that it was Li Shilian. He then laughed: What are you congratulating me for? A matchmaker is just running errands for others. Li Shilian laughed: Are you still pretending to be confused with me? I already received the tea house attendant's report a long time ago. At this time, the tea house attendant had already left. Huanhua blushed and said to him in a low voice: What did the tea house attendant report to you? Li Shilian laughed: He reported whatever you did. Huanhua was always afraid that he reported the matter of her stealing money. Therefore, she said: Did he say that I went to Mr. Jia's room? Li Shilian laughed: He didn't say you went, but that Mr. Jia came to your room. Huanhua didn't want to hide other things, so she laughed to Shilian: That's right, there was this matter. I'm still very grateful for your introduction last time. If it weren't for your introduction first, I still wouldn't know Mr. Jia by now. Li Shilian laughed: I know your purpose isn't his money. What conditions did you discuss with him? (174)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Cherry Blossoms</h3>
<p>— (Jin Junren)</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms are the national flower of the Three Islands (Japan). The Chinese people have never valued them much. The cherry blossoms of Qingdao are actually a legacy of its return (from Japanese occupation). In the fragrant March of spring, when the grass is lush and the willows are green, the flowers bloom all over the trees, dazzling like clouds of brocade. Looking closely, they are like a young girl's light rouge, her jade cheeks slightly flushed; looking from afar, they resemble ten thousand feet of silver silk, their brilliance dazzling. Today, the places with the most cherry blossoms are Zhongshan Park and the Japanese Shrine. The Japanese Shrine is a privately owned area of the Japanese, so the Chinese people rarely set foot there. Zhongshan Park is entirely a place for the Chinese people to visit and enjoy. When the flowers bloom in spring, tens of thousands of people crowd together. Various merchants also set up temporary stalls in the park to conduct business, which is what Qingdao calls the Cherry Blossom Festival. The festival period initially has no fixed rules, lasting about a week. After this, the flowers wither and the tourists are satisfied. In the park, there are Cherry Blossom Road and Double Cherry Blossom Road. On the former, a cherry tree is planted on each side of the road; on the latter, two trees are planted on each side. The cherry blossoms lining the road reflect each other like brocade. Walking beneath them, all worries disappear.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When evening comes, after the sunlight has been collected, these silks, which have been dyed but not yet dried, must be brought indoors from the stone platform, to prevent the storm at night from ruining their colors. Inside the house, bamboo poles are not used, but a special wooden frame is used to hang them in twists and turns. These wooden frames are made very exquisitely, and are also painted with very beautiful colors. Sometimes, in good weather, the silk workers also directly carry these wooden frames out to dry the silk, which can save the trouble of taking them down from the frames and hanging them on bamboo poles again.</p>
<p>These silk-making girls do not need to wear court dresses or formal attire. They are free to wear all kinds of light and nimble clothing. Fortunately, they also have a lot of free time, which is perfect for spending on tailoring their own clothes. So, they dress up every day as if it were a holiday. And because there are many people and comparisons, they become extra motivated; if they were not afraid of being scolded by the Empress Dowager, they might dress even more prettily than prostitutes!

<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Clear Arrangement on the Desk</h3>
<p>— Tian Sheweng</p>
<p>In the noisy city, having a small study with bright windows and a clean desk is truly a great happiness! With a small study, it should be neatly arranged. Although there is no need for a stand for books, a zither, or a peach mat, a quiet bamboo curtain rolled up and classic books laid out are essential. As for the arrangement on the desk, it should also be meticulous. It can both delight the eyes and expand the mind, please the emotions and gladden the heart; and it can also decorate and beautify, containing artistic meaning. Botanists say: "The branches and leaves of plants can release oxygen and absorb carbon." People's breathing releases carbon dioxide, which requires oxygen. Having plant displays on the desk, doesn't that absorb the carbon dioxide in the room and replenish oxygen? Cleaning the air and assisting breathing, plants have a close relationship with people.</p>
<p>For a clear arrangement on the desk, besides a miniature rockery and a few goldfish, potted flowers and bottle plants are the best. In this city of ten miles of marketplaces, there is not a single hill or valley to roam. In leisure, admiring the miniature rockery and carefully counting the fish, is that not the joy of climbing mountains and facing water? As for the potted flowers and bottle plants that are most suitable for the desk, there are several types:</p>
<p>(1) Narcissus. For a clear arrangement at the beginning of the year, red plum blossoms, heavenly bamboo, and narcissus are considered excellent, and these are displayed in the hall. Only the narcissus in a porcelain pot can be a clear arrangement on the desk. The goddess of the waves is extraordinarily graceful and charming. At this time, the red plum blossoms have already withered. It, along with orchids, in jade platters and golden cups, has a clear fragrance and is delicately enchanting. Is it not intoxicating? In botany, it is an annual herb with slender leaves and parallel veins, and a bulbous underground stem. Planted in a porcelain pot, protected with pebbles, and filled with clear water, it is even cleaner than lotus and orchids.</p>
<p>(2) Buddha's Hand Citron. Fragrant, the wax gourd are all displays for the desk; but the Buddha's hand citron is especially exquisite. The Encyclopedia of Flowers says: "The Buddha's hand citron tree is like vermilion music, with long, pointed leaves and thorns." In fact, it is an evergreen shrub, produced in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, and is of the same species as the citron. The leaves are rounded, with thorns in the leaf axils, similar to orange, grapefruit, and mandarin orange plants. It blooms with five-petaled white flowers in the spring, and the fruit ripens in late summer, turning yellow and splitting at the top like human fingers, hence the name "Buddha's hand." Among plants, I like gourds and Buddha's hand citrons the most. Their postures are ingenious and exquisite, so moving. The Creator is truly inconceivable! The Buddha's hand has a refreshing fragrance. Without needing to pick flowers, it already forms hand seals. A clear companion on the desk, it is also enough to thoroughly understand the wonderful truth of the essence of reality.</p>
<p>(3) Rock Calamus. Calamus is a perennial herb that grows by the water. The ones with slender leaves are their variant, called "Rock Calamus." Planted in a tile pot, it is green and pleasing to the eye. Placed on the desk, it can not only be appreciated, but is also beneficial to health.</p>

<h3>The Use of Confucian Scholars</h3>
<p>— Yang Changxi</p>
<p>Originally, Chinese literati have never given people a good impression. Of course, emperors of all dynasties have done some "using literature to convey the Way" when the world was at peace, but those engaged in literature only used literature as a stepping stone to advancement, as the saying goes, "excel in learning to become an official," and in reality only did a kind of idle play. It was either writing poems and composing odes for people to enjoy, or purely becoming a tool for praising virtues. It is truly said that reaching the "Confucian effect" mentioned in Xunzi's "Encouragement of Learning", is impossible to find many throughout the millennium.</p>
<p>Ancient literati were mostly called "Confucian scholars." The Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng, "teaching and guiding King Cheng to understand the Way, and being able to conceal his achievements in the culture and military." And his behavior was called something that only a sage could do, so it was called "the great effect of a Confucian scholar." Other, relatively inferior Confucian scholars, "follow the former kings, promote ritual and righteousness, are cautious as subjects and bring honor to their superiors. If the ruler uses them, they will be in charge of the dynasty and be suitable. If they are not used, they will retire, educate the people, and must be obedient to their inferiors. Even if they are poor and hungry, they will not be greedy through evil means, and without a place to put an awl, they will be clear about upholding the great righteousness of the state." Others, Confucian scholars of a lower rank, are unworthy of mention.</p>
<p>Since Confucian scholars have the above-mentioned "Confucian effect," why are they scolded as useless things? This is naturally related to the social environment at the time, and their own impracticality is also a major reason. Regarding the social environment, the complaints expressed in the poems and essays of literati of all dynasties are enough to explain. Eight or nine tenths of their complaints ridicule and satirize things like "recognition." Just as Liu Xie said in the "Appreciation of Music" chapter of "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons": "The appreciation of music is difficult! Music is truly difficult to understand, and to meet an appreciator is truly difficult to encounter. Is meeting an appreciator once in a thousand years?" Even if there is an appreciator, they only love novelty. For example: "When Chu said it first came out, and the Rhapsody on Shanglin Park was first composed, Emperor Qin and Emperor Wu regretted not being in the same era. Since they were in the same era, Han Xin was imprisoned and Ma Yuan was belittled..." This has already made literati sigh at the difficulty of recognition, and then added to the literary men's mutual contempt, similar to "envy among peers." In praising oneself and suppressing others, it is not only like Zhuang Zhou's laughter at the breaking of the Yang tree, and Song Yu's lament for white snow. Furthermore, their own "not valuing practicality, but only valuing empty words" inevitably led to setbacks everywhere. Even if one day their skills were sold, those who could "practice what they preach" and "work hard in a down-to-earth manner" were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Thus, Confucian scholars who talked about metaphysics and valued empty talk, compared to pragmatists (?), inevitably invited ridicule: "Literature adorned with hearts and broad belts, stealing the attire of the Duke of Zhou, bowing and shrinking; stealing the appearance of Confucius, their arguments and praises are stolen from Zichan and Zigong, their satire and criticisms on governance exceed the talents of Guan Zhong and Yan Ying, but their hearts are lowly, their ambitions small, and their positions limited; when given authority, they are confused and unable to govern..." (Huan Kuan's "Discourse on Salt and Iron," chapter on "Profit and Debate"). Even later Confucian scholars could criticize their measures from the responsibilities of officials, and even conceal their own valuing of empty talk by saying, "Without a position in the world, even Yao and Shun cannot govern the people," but the emptiness of their words and the sloppiness of their actions only led them to retreat and blame fate.</p>
<p>Although the mutual contempt among literati is "inherent since ancient times, and especially severe today," as Cao Pi said, I feel that Xunzi is the one who can stand in the position of a literati to criticize literati, and can instead point out the path for literati. In the chapter "Against the Twelve Philosophers," he strongly criticized those in the Warring States period who "adorned evil doctrines with false words to disrupt the world, with extravagant and deceptive words, making the world confused and unaware of the existence of right and wrong, order and chaos." There were Chen Zhong, Shi You, Mo Di, Song Xing, Shen Dao, Tian Pian, Hui Shi, Deng Xi, Wei Mou, Yi Bi, Zisi, Meng Ke, and twelve others. Zisi and Meng Ke were originally his predecessors, but he did not hesitate to criticize them, believing that Zisi and Meng Ke's sin was that they "neglected the laws of the former kings and did not know their system, and still their talents were great and their ambitions were large, their knowledge was mixed and broad; they examined the old ways and created the so-called Five Elements, which were extremely biased and irrelevant, obscure and without explanation, closed and without interpretation." Therefore, he decorated their words and respectfully said that they were the words of the former gentleman (Confucius). In Zisi's singing and Meng Ke's harmony, the world was deceived by them. In Xunzi's mind, he looked down on those Confucian scholars who could not summarize strategies, align words and actions, unify categories, and could not gather the heroes of the world and tell them of the great ancient teachings and teach them the ultimate obedience, and could not fully possess the articles of the sage kings and the sudden rise of the customs of a peaceful world within the audience hall and on the seat. The figures he idealizes are those who can "above, emulate the institutions of Shun and Yu, and below, emulate the righteousness of Zhongni and Zigong to seek peace." If this can be achieved, then there will be no gap for all those who strive to change the world with their own ways, and "the harm to the world will be eliminated, the affairs of benevolent people will be completed, and the traces of the sage kings will be manifested." But where are there truly such Confucian scholars in ancient and modern times?</p>
<p>In modern times, the morals of the world are declining, and corrupt Confucians are being eliminated day by day. The followers of the modernized Twelve Philosophers are everywhere. Everyone wants to take shortcuts to achieve fame and wealth. Who is willing to bury their heads in hard work to be a bookworm?</p>
<h3>The Song of Zhaogao</h3>
<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>From Hefei to Chao County, the roadbed for the railway is being built. The roadbed occupies the people's fields. The landowners immediately get the land price, but the land tax must still be paid in full. The peasants cannot afford to submit a petition to sue, and there is no public opinion in the newspapers. So, someone said to a certain landlord, asking him to entrust a relative who is a member of the Supervisory Yuan to propose an impeachment case.</p>
<p>Zhaogao is a small place, but when commerce was prosperous, the British American Tobacco Company's cigarettes could sell up to two thousand cases a year. Each case paid a national tax of eighty yuan. So, a small place had to bear a national tax of 160,000 yuan a year on British American Tobacco Company's cigarettes. Other things can be imagined. However, in recent years, commerce has been sluggish, and the poverty of the countryside has become more acute. If the commercial index of 1928 is taken as 100, then the commercial index of Zhaogao in 1934 is only about 30. The vegetable oil lamp, which was driven into the poor countryside by kerosene, has come out again. Many families who light kerosene lamps are also using both kerosene and vegetable oil. The city and the countryside jointly express a high degree of poverty.</p>
<p>Those honest peasants have difficulty maintaining even a "hand-to-mouth" life. Some are burdened with rent, and some are burdened with debts. The creditors themselves are unable to maintain themselves, so they force the rent and force the repayment of debts. Those who can pay must pay, and those who cannot pay have no choice but to be taken to court. And those peasants who have neither the ability to repay nor the courage to struggle, and are limited by the dual oppression of hunger and debt, have no choice but to die, either by taking opium or by hanging themselves. Opium is as easy to buy as rice in the inland, and hanging oneself requires no expense.</p>
<p>Those who are slightly more lively, having never had the opportunity to be educated, of course do not know the root cause of poverty and the goals and methods of struggle, and are unwilling to starve to death. The only way is to take risks. Those who stand on the heads of the peasants, eating their fill and growing fat, talk about benevolence and morality in spring chairs. The so-called "cunning" peasants who cannot even live comfortably in thatched huts have no choice but to become bandits on the yellow earth road, robbing their fellow villagers. Often at dusk, people carrying dozens of copper coins are also robbed.</p>
<p>They are truly without food to fill their hunger. Even the "New Year's Eve dinner" that is valued by the general public is impossible for many poor people to prepare. If they don't become bandits, they will starve to death. So, around the Lunar New Year, the hometown is plagued by bandits. Although "unlawful" bandits were executed on New Year's Eve, robberies still occurred. And large groups of bandits are brewing an act of robbing a town at the junction of Hefei and Chao County. So, the local area is panicking day by day. News of small market towns being robbed is often heard. The two counties send troops to suppress them, but the bandits cannot be completely eliminated, at least not before the fear of hunger is resolved. Many villages cannot find three silver dollars, nor can they find three dou of white rice. They eat yellow turnips, wild vegetables, buckwheat, sweet potatoes, corn, and the like. It is expected that people will starve to death between the second and third months of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Many rural families leave their hometowns and go to the cities to seek a living, especially women. And those who cannot even wait for employment or are trapped in desperation have no choice but to sell their daughters to others as servants, and selling girls to others as maids is the most common. Ordinary girls can be sold very easily for thirty or forty yuan. Although the law states that men and women are equal and prohibits the trafficking of people, due to poverty and hunger, the trafficking of people in the inland is as common as the open sale of "black rice" in "earthen shops." Even in Nanjing, I have seen refugees shouting and selling their children on Zhongshan Road and heard of the fact of selling girls.</p>
<p>Another emergency solution is to engage in prostitution. It is common for poor women in cities to engage in prostitution. This wind of prostitution, however, along with foreign goods and syphilis, has blown into the countryside. Rural women go to cities and towns to engage in prostitution for money. The price is only one or two yuan each time, and sometimes even only twenty or thirty copper coins. Although it is so little in the eyes of people in the city, it is considerable in the eyes of rural, impoverished, and ignorant women. So, venereal diseases are transmitted from the cities to the towns and then from the towns to the countryside. There are no modern hospitals in the countryside, and the germs spread wider and wider, resulting in the "deepening into the people" of opium and syphilis and truly "working hard at the grassroots level." Sedan chair carriers also smoke opium, and innocent peasants also contract venereal diseases.</p>
<p>In just over ten days, I reviewed the lives of the lower classes in the inland. The trafficking of people and other pitiful events caused my brain, which had been numb for two years, to have a slightly tired reaction. Although there is something I want to say, I don't have the enthusiasm to say it like before.</p>
<h3>On the Motive of Writing</h3>
<p>— Bai Lai</p>
<p>"I don't care at all whether I have genius, or whether what I write is good or bad. I am simply telling myself. And that is all I need. Why? Because, in my opinion, writing is not serving something else, it is merely a means of developing oneself." Artzybashev once confessed in this way. This kind of motivation for writing solely for "developing oneself" has existed since ancient times. The reason it appears more blatant and vulgar today is simply that the scope of individual life has been limited by an unreasonable social system to the point where it can no longer be reduced. "Writing" has become a means for those who value themselves above all else to strive for a lifeline of their own.</p>
<p>Naturally, no one is a sage who can forget themselves. Moreover, many sages, as Voltaire said, are just big liars. Therefore, even if Balzac only poured his sincerity into every work, and his purpose was merely to write in order to "pay off debts," he was still a great author. The problem here is that as an author, in order to achieve goals other than writing, he would not hesitate to violate the truth, thus becoming a poisonous weed, which is truly sickening. I now have some understanding: why an author once shouted out the cry, "I want to break away from the ranks of literary people." Precisely because as a literary person, one loves to protect "oneself" the most. Furthermore, it is well known that our literary world has buried the efforts of many young literary talents. However, we these latecomers in writing, often overvalue our own efforts, and thus curse, complain about, or even insult our predecessors; this is equally unworthy of emulation.</p>
<p>Understanding this point, then it can be expected that "enlightened" authors will no longer write for their own vanity, status, fame, and fortune. Because of the socialization of the production system, people will break through "self" and write for "society." Moreover, only such authors are worthy of building an immortal monument in the hearts of millions of readers.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Vendor Liang Hu Zi</h3>
<p>— Wu Guanglue</p>
<p>It was already past noon.</p>
<p>Vegetable vendor Liang Hu Zi still had a full load of vegetables on his shoulders. When he set off from home in the morning, this load of vegetables weighed heavily on his shoulders, and now it was still this load of vegetables; how futile it was for time to pass by second by second, and for the fatigue of trudging from this village to that village! Liang Hu Zi, feeling the coldness and despair of business, could not help but shed tears, and sobbed softly at the sadness of his own fate.</p>
<p>He was already fifty-one years old this year, with sparse and gray hair, sunken eyes, a black and soft long beard, high cheekbones, and missing teeth... In short, everything about him was a sign of approaching old age. At his age, if he had been born into a rich family, he would definitely be eating idle meals all day, accompanying his grandchildren and enjoying the happiness of his later years. But how disrespectful the Creator was to him! Now, for the sake of his old wife and his own two meals a day, he had to work hard and run around! "Life" was such a serious and cruel matter for him!</p>
<p>"Anyone want to buy green vegetables?"</p>
<p>He wandered around the ends of the alleys, shouting in a hoarse voice. His trembling tone echoed in the silent space, all the more implying a kind of miserable feeling. In such a year of famine and disaster, all the villagers felt the extreme difficulty of life, and even the necessities of "food" were almost impossible to afford, so how could they have extra money to buy vegetables? Even though Liang Hu Zi raised his voice and shouted with all his might, it was all in vain.</p>
<p>"The world has changed!"</p>
<p>He sighed again in a hoarse voice. He recalled the past: at that time, he would carry a full basket of vegetables out in the morning, and sell them all after touring three or two villages. He remembered the scene when the villagers rushed to buy when the vegetable load stopped; he remembered the pleasure of leisurely going to the teahouse alone when the green vegetables were sold out: remembering all this, a wave of smiles flashed on his lips again. But now, he had run through five villages, large and small, and the vegetables were still so full in the load! Struck by this cruel event, he couldn't help but sigh again in a sad and hoarse voice.</p>
<p>Despairingly, he ran towards another village again. He anxiously looked at the sun, and then at the vegetables in the basket: he was silently considering the fate of his goods. The glittering rays of the sun shone on his thin face covered with sweat, that face was like a clay statue in a rainstorm, making people feel pity and fear. His bright eyes stared at the dull sky, silently proclaiming like a devout Christian praying:</p>
<p>"God, it would be good if the years changed..."</p>
<p>He walked on the desolate and winding village road. The surroundings were deathly silent. In this human world as miserable as a funeral vault, in addition to bearing the heavy burden of the vegetable load on his shoulders, all beautiful and foolish dreams floated in his mind. Like such an ignorant old man, apart from resigning himself to fate, what else did he know that someone could change everything?</p>
<h3>Mr. Ju Qing (7)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Being a school board member naturally required someone with status and prestige in the town. For example, the famous gentleman Zhang Xiaofeng had such qualifications. Before this term, he had served as a school board member of the district elementary school for five consecutive years, with his younger brother Xiaoyan in charge of everything, serving as the principal. For the first three years, for some reason, Mr. Xiaoyan was suddenly elected as a member of the county party headquarters thanks to the promotion of a classmate; then Zhang Xiaofeng was also honorably appointed as the preparatory director of the district office in this town, and the two brothers both rose rapidly in their careers. Once they let go, the school board member of the district elementary school was replaced, and the president of the town's Chamber of Commerce, Chu Runfu, took over the position.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone was a figure in the community, and their personal friendships were excellent, so "enthusiasm for education" could naturally be shared without distinction. However, since last summer, when Zhang Xiaofeng's son, Youxiong, graduated from the county middle school and returned, after being idle at home for half a year, the situation changed a little.</p>
<p>It is said that the results of the district elementary school have not been good in the past two years, so at the beginning of spring, someone launched a re-election of the school board members, and as a result, Zhang Xiaofeng returned to the position.</p>
<p>Then young master Youxiong took office and took over the position of principal.</p>
<p>However, things don't seem to be that simple. On the one hand, the school has already started, and when collecting funds from all parties, they all said that the former school board member had taken them away; the former school board member's finances, the seal, and important documents have not been handed over. After several negotiations, there was no result, so a storm was brewing.</p>

<h3>What Kind of Books Should Young People Read</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>What is shown in the restoration movement is naturally the ancient air. Like the recent large and small bookstores, they are reprinting ancient books such as Siku Quanshu, Tu Shu Ji Cheng, and the Twenty-Five Histories, and Twenty-Six Histories. This is also a phenomenon of restoration.</p>
<p>In present-day China, there are indeed many people who like to tumble in the piles of ancient books. Those who are poisoned by ancient books are not counted; most of them take pride in considering themselves ancient people. A group of sages of the time, for the sake of their own status, have to pretend to be antiquarians, and decorate their bookshelves with a few ancient books to show their enthusiasm for promoting the restoration movement. There are also those who strongly advocate and promote reading ancient books, and those who are forced to read ancient books. Therefore, ancient books are reprinted in response to the situation!</p>
<p>However, since some people in the current intellectual class like to read ancient books, there is naturally a need to reprint ancient books. On the other hand, since some people like to read new books, there is naturally a need to compile and select new books. These are all digressions.</p>
<p>The question is here: At present, in the Chinese publishing industry, ancient books are being reprinted, and new books are also being compiled and selected. As a modern Chinese youth, should we read ancient books and study a little ancient knowledge? Or should we read new books and absorb some new knowledge? If this question is not entirely meaningless, then it is necessary to bring it up for discussion.</p>
<p>In our view, modern Chinese youth should read new books and should not read ancient books. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>First, knowledge is constantly changing. Therefore, we are constantly pursuing new knowledge, and where do we have the leisure to browse ancient books?</p>
<p>Second, knowledge is a tool for life. Modern people should live a modern life, so modern Chinese youth should also acquire some new knowledge in order to adapt to the living environment.</p>
<p>Third, the culture of a country can only survive by moving forward; retreating will lead to destruction. Modern Chinese youth have the mission of promoting the forward development of Chinese culture. Therefore, our task is to create a new culture.</p>
<p>Fourth, even if ancient books are treasures, we can only obtain various knowledge that meets the needs of the times from new books.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the trend of reprinting ancient books is prevalent today, we can still have this Chinese New Literature Series to read, which can be said to be the good fortune of modern Chinese youth!</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>"The green grass of March is like oil, our family takes a foreign ship to drift away: the spring tide rolls thousands of miles away, the girl at the field head is sad in every way." Singing, the noisy singing voice floated leisurely on the river again: these simple, popular sentences, paired with a series of stiff local accents, even if they were unpleasant, were more than enough to make the old boatman yearn. A kind of nostalgia for the homeland rose uncontrollably like a thick fog, following this intimate and familiar local accent, the mountains and rivers of the homeland appeared in fantasy and memory, the faces of the relatives and friends of the old homeland appeared, and the rouge-colored lovely traces of the youthful age in the homeland also appeared - the youthful page was still very clear in front of him, but the era had already turned a cruel, green face without mercy, and people trembled in front of it wearing the mourning clothes of old age, the good days were, finally like the waves that passed under the boat, like the early spring tide, one pushing another, forever, without looking back, rushing towards the endless front, and then dissipating.</p>
<p>At the age of over fifty, he still carried the innate nature of loving the sea and loving the water, and lonely rowed a small boat: whether it was a gentle breeze or a violent storm, he always refused to rest for a day and floated on the river, waiting for the shouts of the guests on the shore: "Hey, boatman, crossing the river, crossing the river!" So, while responding with a cadence, he gratefully and eagerly pulled the boat close, let the guests board the boat, and then pulled the boat to the other side, the guests crossed the river, and when they went ashore, they left ten or five copper coins, and gathered the copper coins every day, buying rice, measuring oil, and perhaps going to the street to buy a zhang of blue cloth on festivals, if there were a few extra copper coins, he would accumulate the extra ones into silver corners, and then accumulate the silver corners into a big ocean coin, and hide them in the cloth bag under the cabin board. So, the serpent-like years passed easily page by page, blurred almost like reeds.</p>
<p>(He is also a person with parents, wife, and children, but his hometown is like a firecracker behind a string of days: fighting, fighting back and forth, on a day many years ago, a battalion of soldiers came to the village, and then in less than a month, they started firing, two old ones, one ate a bullet, one died of illness, and the young wife who had only been married for less than a year was also dragged from under the bed by five soldiers one night, still carrying a five-month-old fetus in her belly, and...</p>
<p>Home has been destroyed in a fire, his own son fled for thirty miles on a muddy road at night, and pretended to be dead in the pile of corpses, and that's how he managed to escape with his life after three days and nights, wandering like a beggar. A year and a half later, the war was over, and he returned home: the house was gone, the woman and his parents were gone, and only a dilapidated small ferry boat was left in the swamp.</p>
<p>Lowering his head, the tide in the river rose in April, and the boat drifted like autumn leaves, so: wiping his wet eyes, dragging the broken boat out.)</p>
<p>From then on, he forgot about home, forgot about the world, but learned the old sailor's wandering tune: "Ai ya ai, drifting through five lakes and four seas; spring tide, spring tide, you go, a man leaves home and never looks back!"</p>
<p>The spring tide does not know how to flow back, and a man's drifting does not know how to go home. In this way, fifty years have passed by glittering with the silver light in the spring tide once a year, the old boatman has no home, the old boatman's hometown is the water country rippling with the spring tide.</p>
<p>The boat, in the end, also seemed dilapidated in a lifetime of drifting, and what about people? ... No, when the wind in the third month of spring blows again, facing the surging river water, the old boatman also sighed, also remembered something, lingering, with endless depth and distance.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shout of "Hey"! - Someone on the shore called for a crossing.</p>
<h3>Days of Worry</h3>
<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>The hoe digs down, but the heart is not in the digging.</p>
<p>Many things were spinning around in my heart, spinning so much that my head ached, and after thinking about it, I couldn't figure anything out.</p>
<p>—The Xue family's two loads of rent are already from the year before, can they get through the end of this year? Let's plan this first.</p>
<p>—But Li Tu Zi's twenty yuan with three-point interest, paying interest every month can't hold up! Damn it! Borrowing twenty yuan from him, the interest paid is enough for the principal for several months!</p>
<p>—Those small debts on the street are not a small amount either, unless you don't want to walk on the street, how can you get rid of these?…</p>
<p>—That evil creature, born of a prostitute! Dare to say I'm poor! Even if my old man is so poor that he's begging for food, shouldn't a wife scold me for "not being promising?" Really a heartless prostitute!</p>
<p>Furiously, the hoe dug down, but the heart was not in the digging: "Bang!" With a sound, the hoe hit a rock, and sparks splashed in all directions; waking up suddenly, he picked up the hoe and took a look, "Damn it! A big gap!" He spat and cursed.</p>
<p>The work stopped like this, and he took a few steps forward and sat down on a bluestone. The sun was shining on his head, warming him, there was no wind, there was, just a little - it was a warm winter afternoon blowing a southerly wind.</p>
<p>Veins were bulging on his forehead, and A Da seemed to be dreaming: he recalled the full warehouse of sweet potato rice left to him by his father when he died three years ago, and a few sections of bright sweet potatoes - ah, those bright sweet potatoes! Where have they all gone now? Wasn't it all spent on courting that dead demon? And now, now that he is poor, even she has become like this!</p>
<p>—Is there really such a thing in the world? The thunder won't strike her to death! Finally, he stood up fiercely again, grabbed the hoe like a bandit, and dug down hard, "Bang" Another stone! A stone? He lowered his head, yes, it was indeed the same stone as before!</p>
<p>—Damn it! Is even a stone looking for trouble with me? Fine! Let's say I'm possessed by a ghost today, I'm going back to his mother's house!</p>
<p>So he carried the hoe on his back and walked slowly along the winding field bank towards the village; his heart seemed to be hanging in another world, and the gentle breeze caressed his flushed face, but he didn't feel it at all.</p>
<p>—Hey! A Da! Send those few rice accounts over the day after tomorrow, okay?</p>
<p>It was the owner of the rice store at the entrance of the village shouting across the counter. He was startled and raised his head sharply, and realized that he had already entered the village, so he stopped, looked at the owner of the rice store, and immediately replied:</p>
<p>—Yes! I know, don't keep urging me every day!</p>
<p>When he saw the two half-closed doors of his house in the distance, the scene of the morning quarrel immediately intensified and disturbed his mind, and his troubles made him not want to go home: but</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>a pair of disobedient feet finally moved him to the front of the door.</p>
<p>In order to show some prestige to the people inside, he raised his foot and kicked the door in heavily, he thought: If this works, she will come out to see me immediately, then everything will be fine!</p>
<p>However, it was quiet inside, not only did no one come out, but there wasn't even a "Who is it?" He cursed in his heart and stepped into the door, unloaded the hoe, and threw it casually towards the corner of the door, rushing into the room angrily.</p>
<p>The room was dark, and he couldn't see anything when he first entered the room. He held his breath and paused for a while, then fixed his eyes and looked at the bed: there was no one there at all, the bed was empty.</p>
<p>A premonition quickly broke into his consciousness, his heart jumped, and he quickly turned his head: the only box he had next to him was open and empty, like it had been robbed, facing him!</p>
<p>—Ah, it's over! Anger immediately sank from his body, and his eyes were dizzy. He fell straight down onto the bed...</p>
<p>A shout of "Is A Da at home?" came from outside.</p>
<h3>Spring Rain</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>It is also a heavy sky,</p>
<p>It is also drizzling rain,</p>
<p>It is also a hazy lake;</p>
<p>You say: The heavy sky is the time of wind and rain,</p>
<p>The drizzling rain is the tears of parting,</p>
<p>There are arc sails on the hazy lake surface rushing on their way.</p>
<p>That was a few years ago, when we were about to part, we were all saying goodbye on this lake; at that time, everyone had the heart of a young man, wanting to do something for people's careers, wanting to be firm, wanting to be brave, wanting to be earth-shattering: in the drizzling rain, we each rushed on our own way; among us, some people regarded the hazy lake surface as a kind of evil force, the mental strength of young people made young people want to open a path in the haze, even if only a lone sail was left, they still had to row forward, even if the lake surface was hazy again, the haze would definitely let young people open a path. We all thought this way, in the drizzling rain and hazy lake surface, we said goodbye.</p>
<p>However, that goodbye, some actually became farewells with me forever.</p>
<p>It is also this time, it is also this sky, this rain, this lake surface: and facing this scene, there is only me alone. Thinking of so many friends, how many people have died before their ideals: "Work hard," their words are still in my ears: thinking back to my own life in recent years, walking to the old place where they once set foot, it made me silently stare at the lake surface, for a long time, I was just silent. The lake surface in front of me is still hazy, how many hazes have I rushed through? Does the water surface still have some water ripples of my own progress? Thinking, I am just silent!</p>
<p>I know very well that many friends have rushed to that side, even if the result has never been effective, they died; but that is still admirable; compared to those who live in vain, how much stronger is it? In silence, I also felt some anger; "Work hard" their words, I will never forget.</p>
<p>Anger is still difficult to suppress the past. No matter what, I think of that young man with disheveled hair, from entering prison to dying, when I tread on the place he once trod, in anger, I cannot help but feel sad. The emotions of young people are so precious, so endearing. It will ignite another part of the heart fire of young people, they are all young people, they love each other, understand each other, it is so easy, so sincere, so deep.</p>
<p>What shall I say to this hazy lake surface? I am still only silent. The willows sprout tender buds again, the peach blossoms bloom silently, and wither silently. Nature always repeats like this, taking away some in the repetition, and bringing some back. It's always like this; how can it allow you not to go? Yes, "Work hard," the spring rain brings me this message. Commemorating the friends who died for their ideals, I will never forget their words.</p>
<p>It is also a heavy sky,</p>
<p>It is also drizzling rain,</p>
<p>It is also a hazy lake;</p>
<p>I say: The heavy sky is the time of wind and rain,</p>
<p>The hazy lake surface does not see the shadow of your lone sail,</p>
<p>The drizzling rain, is just drizzling rain.</p>
<p>Yes, the rain beats the peach blossoms, and also beats the tombs in the wilderness, the dead are dead, and what about the living?</p>
<p>Could it be that the drizzling rain is tears?</p>
<h3>"Lost"</h3>
<p>— Qingquan Made</p>
<h3>One Year Old</h3>
<p>— Sakura no</p>
<p>The child is exactly one year old! The night before, my wife whispered softly in my ear as we were about to sleep.</p>
<p>Sunday, when the dawn breaks, it will be such a refreshing climate! A gentle breeze kisses my cheeks, bringing a soft and comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>Turning my head, my son lay in the inner bed, his bright, round eyes fixed on me! Then he gave me the cutest wink, pursing his lips!</p>
<p>(He seems to feel delighted at being one year old!)</p>
<p>I woke my wife up, and she asked what to buy for the child as a gift. I pondered in my mind, slowly getting dressed.</p>
<p>With a heart full of anticipation, I walked out of the house. I calculated whether the value in my pocket matched the goods I wanted to buy.</p>
<p>In a shop, I saw a very lovely little children's suit, priced at two dollars and seventy-five cents. The shop assistant enthusiastically wrapped it up in colored wrapping paper. I had to reach for the wallet in my pocket without further delay.</p>
<p>As I turned around, I saw a very polite little sailor hat, also giving me a warm salute, as if very eager for me to take it home with me.</p>
<p>It seemed like the easiest kind of temptation to sway one's original intentions! When returning home, I still had it tucked under my arm.</p>
<p>My wife quickly put the clothes on the child. The child pulled hard on the brim of the hat, refusing to let go. My wife then happily said to herself:</p>
<p>"Doing it this way, Dad is very thoughtful."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, my wife suggested taking a photo of the child as a memento! It also occurred to me that today was my son's birthday. In a letter my mother sent a week ago, she wrote very earnestly that we should buy a pair of incense sticks and candles to pray to the Bodhisattva on that day. So I asked if we needed to buy these things.</p>
<p>I knew this was still her most familiar mischievous way of asking indirectly, and I used my mother's tone to agree to this matter.</p>
<p>She said we should buy some cheaper dishes today! I finally couldn't help but smile at her.</p>
<p>Before and after the meal, she didn't mention taking photos or anything like that again.</p>
<p>"It's our son's birthday today, don't you dare hit him or scold him carelessly."</p>
<p>While washing the dishes, I don't know how she remembered this, and she said it to me as if reminding me.</p>
<p>"Let's take our son to get a photo taken!" I said to her frankly.</p>
<p>"How did you remember again?" she said, but then looked at me carefully a few times, as if suspecting that these words were not sincere.</p>
<p>I smiled at her. I picked up the child in my arms, and she smiled happily too.</p>
<p>After taking the photo at Guanghua Studio, my wife looked particularly happy. Let's take a stroll back!</p>
<p>We quickly paced a long way back and forth on Avenue Joffre, my wife leaning on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Let's pray that our son will always be adorable.</p>

<p>Opening: "Daiyu Buries the Flowers"</p>
<p>The beauty of the famous garden is all hidden away. A hundred purples and a thousand reds compete in their gorgeous attire. Beautiful scenery. Beautiful scenery. Butterflies dance, and bees fly, happily spreading joy. Who knew that every moment is precious and easily lost? No plan can keep spring here; we resent the Eastern Emperor. Lin Daiyu. Her sorrow and hatred are long. Quietly. She sits quietly on her ivory bed. Sick and weak. Her illness makes her bones thinner. Tears fall. Tears stream down her cheeks. Listen to the pattering of the rain. The rain wets the gauze window. The wind blows. The wind enters the embroidered silk tent. I think of myself. My life is as thin as a flower. Who will protect the flower? Protect it to avoid its ruin. I think that tomorrow, the red will fade. Fading into the color of rouge. Falling gently. Falling on the muddy hill. Deep night. Deep night makes sleep difficult. My eyes look around. Looking for dawn is hard to sing. Zhong is busy. Busily walking into the garden. Ignoring the faint dew. The dew wets her silk skirt. Looking at the flower branches. The branches are all withered. No longer fragrant. No longer fragrant in the imperial garden. The remnant flower petals. The petals are buried in the fragrant earth. My emotions are dark. My emotions are sadly sorrowful. I wonder, in future years, who will bury me?</p>

<p>Yu Fu Assassinating Duke Yin (Continued)</p>
<p>Duke Yin's integrity in abdicating the throne was very clear in his heart and obvious in his actions. When Duke Huan was young and weak, if Duke Yin had other ambitions, even a slight hint would have been nipped in the bud. Duke Huan was in Duke Yin's control for eleven years. Not only was there no conflict, but he was also nurtured and raised. There is heaven above and earth below, and his heart and actions cannot be fabricated. The only regrettable thing is that his righteousness was not complete, that he coveted power for a few years and did not abdicate quickly. Because he did not abdicate quickly, the appearance of reluctance was shown outwardly. Yu Fu was thus able to carry out his plot to assassinate Duke Huan. If Duke Yin had retired bravely with a noble spirit, intimidating people, then the unrighteous would not dare approach his wall, and the unjust would not dare approach his courtyard. How could they dare to plot an assassination and sully my hand with treacherous deeds? Now Yu Fu dares to openly express his rebellious words without fear, which must be because Duke Yin showed signs of reluctance, inviting this. Duke Yin still did not take warning, and even told Ruofu, "It is because he is young. I will give it to him. Make preparations for the [mourning] clothes. I am getting old."</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Film Development (X)(II)(Continued from March 8th)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(XII) Forerunners of Sound Film Invention</p>
<p>"A Brief History of Film Development," previously published in this journal, totals eleven sections, and due to the intermittent nature of the original text, it is also divided into three parts for sequential publication. The first part, consisting of five sections, was published from January 7th to 11th; the second part, consisting of six sections, was published from March 3rd to 8th; and this is the third part, which is also the last part. This is specially noted for the convenience of readers.</p>
<p>The history of film development is like a person struggling through hardship and adversity, experiencing many years of failures and successes, until reaching a position of wealth and honor. However, after reaching that position, they begin to feel that the sun declines at midday and the moon wanes after being full. But after thirty years of struggle, has film, which has changed from "moving magic lantern shows" to a great enterprise, also begun to decline after reaching its peak? From the perspective of machinery, finance, and personnel, film had reached its zenith at that time. However, after reaching its zenith, the film industry began to decline. The number of viewers in cinemas was dwindling. Film industry giants felt that the end of film had arrived.</p>
<p>Someone said at that time, "What we need is a good revolution. The entire film industry needs to be reformed. Otherwise, it will be difficult to save the fate of the film industry." Many people laughed at his words, not understanding what he was saying. Perhaps even the speaker did not know what he was saying, because he was simply guessing and expecting. But they did not know that at that time, several dedicated people were working hard in secret rooms. What were they doing? No, they were trying out a new invention, preparing to start a revolutionary storm in the film world. These few people decided to make the films that had been coming and going for a decade or two talk and sing!</p>
<p>This is the birth of sound film! When sound film was born, the great inventor Edison had not yet died. The ability of films to speak was originally something Edison had dreamed of. Now that dream had suddenly come true, it is unknown what Edison thought when he first saw a sound film. But in fact, Edison did not think that the film itself would produce sound. What he imagined was simply connecting the phonograph and the film projector, so that one could hear the sound from the phonograph while watching the film.</p>
<p>We have seen this kind of "sleeping in the same bed, dreaming different dreams" sound film in the early days of sound film. Their dialogues or songs were recorded on records, and when the film was being played, the dialogues and songs on the records were broadcast using a wireless sound amplifier. The biggest drawback of this invention was that it was very complex, very bulky, and it was difficult to synchronize the actions on the screen with the sounds on the record, and there were often discrepancies. Later invented sound films had synchronized action and sound, because the sound was emitted from the film itself. But that was later.</p>
<p>Before the invention of modern sound films, William Fox and his chief engineer Theodor EU Chase first publicly demonstrated his "sound structure" attached to the film. That kind of sound structure was similar to the sound structure on records, but the former was attached to the film, while the latter was wound on the record. At the same time, Warner Brothers also invented a structure that connected films and records. But when the film industry giants heard the results of their inventions, they all shook their heads and said, "This kind of thing is not advanced enough, and cannot be shown to the audience!"</p>
<p>How high had the audience's standards risen! They did not want to see things with rough and uneven sound. But thirty years ago, they had all watched the first moving picture, "The Great Train Robbery," and expressed amazement. When that kind of film was being screened, the vertical lines of light flickered above and below, like rain in the room. When a group of actors performed, they jumped up and down like a group of monkeys. But they all liked to watch that kind of film, and thirty years later, in 1926, when they saw the rough sound films, they refused to even look at them. This shows how surprisingly fast the audience's standards have risen. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Review of "Anne of Green Gables"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>——Showing at the Great Shanghai</p>
<p>Anne of Green Gables</p>
<p>After watching "Anne of Green Gables," it feels like reading a clear and sorrowful little poem by a small stream in the refreshing autumn air, facing the white duckweed and red smartweed.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the artistic conception of this "Anne of Green Gables," the worldview of the original author, L.M. Montgomery, is undoubtedly quite outdated. He writes:</p>
<p>When the orphan Anne was fourteen years old, she was taken in by a brother (Matthew), who decided not to marry because of a broken heart in his youth, and a sister (Marilla), who accompanied him in remaining single into old age. She lived with these two old people, whose lives were unhealthy and whose nature was somewhat perverted, which was not very suitable for her, although she was orphaned, but extremely lively nature. Because she had red hair, she was given the nickname "Carrot" by her male classmates. She violated school rules, and the strict old maid, upon hearing that the other party, Gilbert, was the son of her brother's heartbroken lover, did not punish her, but when Anne loved this young man, Gilbert, she was subjected to extremely severe interference, and even forced to break off contact with him. As a result, the unmarried old adoptive father became seriously ill, and Anne managed to get a famous doctor from Gilbert to save him, and these two old people allowed their engagement.</p>
<p>Here, the original author wants to express the theme that the love of the next generation should not lose its freedom due to the misfortune of the love of the previous generation. However, he did not seek to develop this from the next generation, Anne and Gilbert, actively fighting for their own right to love freely, but passively wanted the old people to feel grateful for the saving of the sick before they would allow it. This point of view explains the author's worldview.</p>
<p>The film "Anne of Green Gables," due to the original work's abundance of natural poetic charm, and the ethical and emotional background; as well as the director George Nicholls Jr.'s delicate and concise approach, has achieved considerable results. But it is not without its shortcomings in terms of the script, apart from the outdated worldview mentioned above. First of all, the Marilla family originally wanted to adopt a boy from the orphanage, but unexpectedly adopted Anne, a girl, by mistake. As for why the mistake happened, and why it was not corrected at the time, the film does not explain it clearly. Secondly, the next day, when Marilla decided to send Anne back to exchange her for a boy, how could the head of the orphanage have taken her to send Anne to the Cuff family to be a maid, and made Marilla take her back again because she couldn't bear to see Anne suffer? This not only shows that Marilla's psychological change of love and pity for Anne is too fast, but also that it is unreasonable for her to go to the Cuff's. Thirdly, although Anne ignored Gilbert because he teased her, causing her to violate school rules, when she learned of the relationship between Gilbert's family and the Marilla's, she already had a great curiosity about him, and Gilbert repeatedly expressed his remorse and admiration to her. Under these circumstances, it was very possible for her and him to make up. However, the film must follow the same old pattern as the love process commonly seen in other films, making Gilbert save her life in danger before earning her grateful love. This is not only a cliché, but also a great show of artificiality.</p>
<p>The director's success lies first in the fact that the emotional components are grasped strongly. Everywhere is full of laughter, but this laughter is enough to make people cry. Secondly, the sound effects are handled well. There are many places in the film that use the strengths of silent films, such as when Anne offended Mrs. Cuff at the Cuff's house and was about to be driven away, and when Matthew came to find a way to keep her, etc., all using silent scenes and heavy lines to achieve valuable results. As for the use of light and shadow, such as Anne's lonely double shadow, old Matthew's slender and charming shadow, and the background when Anne repents to Mrs. Cuff, are all excellent comparisons to the chaotic light during classmates' outings and the flower shadows in Green Gable.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, in addition to Anna Shirley, who had good results in "Little Women," gaining further progress here, Old Matthew, played by O.P. Heggle, is the most successful. Gilbert's early performance is too suggestive of a bad seed. Although he is a bit naughty, he shouldn't give people a bad impression, so that people can sympathize with him when he is later forced to lose his freedom.</p>
<h3>Dickens' Class Consciousness in "David Copperfield"</h3>
<p>— Fo Lei</p>
<p>Charles Dickens, one of the three major novelists of the first half of the nineteenth century, is, like many novelists such as Zola, Stevenson, and Galsworthy, now valued by Hollywood film producers. This naturally shows that Hollywood film producers are running out of film subjects and have to look for subjects from existing famous literary works and adapt many literary classics into films.</p>
<p>Thus, Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" and "Oliver Twist" have been produced before, and now "David Copperfield" is being shown in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is impossible to evaluate Dickens' literary career and works in this limited space. I just want to talk briefly about "David Copperfield," which may be helpful for film viewers to refer to.</p>
<p>Through the protagonist in "David Copperfield," from his childhood to his adulthood, Dickens not only created such a lovely and struggling character for us, but also realistically wrote about the middle class and the poor at that time, their lives and moral concepts. In this "David Copperfield," David's friend Micawber is often an optimist troubled by economic difficulties and creditors, almost a microcosm of his father, who was also forced into prison by debt, while his mother sold furniture to maintain her life. In addition, many of the characters are almost what he encountered in his childhood. In this novel, the only character who can be called upper class is Steerforth, but how does the author describe him? He seduced Ham's fiancée, later abandoned her, and finally drowned at sea. Here, Dickens does not harbor any goodwill towards the upper class: although there is no more intense attack, the satire is sharp enough.</p>
<p>The entire story of "David Copperfield" is extremely simple and touching, full of warmth and friendship. Old Peggotty, his search for Emily, and Ham jumping into the sea to save his rival, these descriptions are very emotional.</p>
<p>With George Cukor, who succeeded in directing "Little Women," to control this story, which is also full of emotion, there is considerable confidence in the results. Actors such as Washa Wen, Leon Barrimua, and Olive are all familiar and beloved characters to movie fans, and their acting skills will undoubtedly be able to develop perfectly under the guidance of such an experienced director.</p>
<p>In "David Copperfield," the scene where David is in his mother's arms, the actor playing the young David is child star Freddy Bartholomew and Elizabeth Allen—showing at Nanjing</p>
<h3>Three Women in a Storm</h3>
<p>Fan Xuepeng's personality was the strongest. She used her "great hands" to work. Chen Yan was a lonely girl. Unable to leap through the dark society, she attempted suicide by drowning but was rescued. Lu Lixia was a romantic female student, a believer in optimism, singing "Sunny Day" and "Beautiful Youth" every day, but in the end, she still suffered deep stimulation.</p>

<p>Produced by MGM, starring Clark Gable and Constance Bennett.</p>
<p>A large car, moving silently, stopped in front of the New York News Recorder newspaper building. The chauffeur, fully uniformed, immediately jumped out and went to open the car door. As soon as the door opened, a graceful woman emerged. That was Sharonna Scott. Her slender figure stood by the sidewalk, the wind blowing her clothes, truly giving a fairy-like impression. She looked at the platinum diamond-encrusted watch on her wrist and said, "Come at half-past six," and walked into the tall newspaper building.</p>
<p>Inside the newspaper building, on a glass door were written the four characters "Chief Editor." Inside was a large desk. The person sitting at the desk was combing his hair with his fingers. He was very young, with dark, slightly curly hair. Although young, he was extremely familiar with the ins and outs of the news industry and knew everything. Because he knew so much, he inevitably became impatient with those who were less knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Now, this chief editor, Jim Brown, was talking to a photographer. That photographer, Barr, considered himself to be a top-notch photographer in the field. Jim held several photos in his hand, examining them with a frown for a long time, and asked him what they were. Barr excitedly told him that those were all the photos from the Peterson case. He said that he had spent three whole days and nights to take them.</p>
<p>The Peterson case, indeed, was now the talk of the town. A wealthy man, a beautiful wife, and a handsome man supplying the object of pursuit for a wealthy wife. But what are these? Rumors, or facts? Jim said to Barr, "What's the story?" Barr was taken aback and said, "Story? How would I know those things?" Jim shook his head and said, "The entire island of New York is gossiping about the Peterson case, him and his wife... and that Pennister, can't our big newspaper find out some real news? Then what do we want these photos for? To put them in frames and hang them up? We must find a way! No matter how difficult! I don't know how to find it, but I know it can be found!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he slammed his fist on the table. Suddenly, he saw a news draft on the pile of papers, with only the two letters "N.S." Jim picked it up and looked at it. It turned out to be a music review, but after reading three lines, he already felt it was out of place and terrible. He couldn't help but wonder, "Hey... who wrote this? Who is N.S.?" Barr said, "She is a socialite. She's only been here for a month. The general manager's wife recommended her." Jim said, "Hey, a socialite? Call her in, I want to see her."</p>
<p>Barr answered and backed out. He closed the door as he left. When the door opened again, the graceful woman who had just stepped out of the car had already slowly walked in front of Jim. Jim couldn't help but feel his heart pounding. He had never seen a woman dressed like this in his life. Her quiet demeanor made a seasoned chief editor uneasy. But he still deliberately pretended to be rude and asked, "Who are you?" The other party calmly said, "You asked me to come. Didn't you want to see me?" She smiled slightly as she spoke. Jim then nodded and said, "Oh, so you are N.S." (To be continued)</p>
