<p>— 特</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞國的酋長古格薩Gugsa投降意國了，這伴事或有很大的後果，因爲古格繭不但是阿軍的指揮，阿皇的女婿，並且是東蒂格里要省Tigre的知事。敵朝活着的兩個首頒之一，他和他的堂弟西根里省知事西育姆（Seyoum或譯賽雄）都是被旭亞Shoa王米尼里克Menelik篡了位的約翰皇的後裔，在過去六十年中，旭亞和蒂格里的關係，很像十六世紀中英倫和蘇格蘭的關係，而意大利趁法國君主扶助斯圖亞特人反抗英倫的當兒，便佔了法國的地位，雙方時常交兵，又時常調和。調和大都因通婚方法，正像亨利第七將女兒瑪迦萊特嫁給蘇格蘭哲姆斯第四一般，米尼里克曾將女兒淑第圖嫁給約翰皇的兒子，不幸此子未及承繼皇位便死了，所以兩朝的聯好，永沒有成熟。</p>
<p>今皇曾圖完成米尼里克未了的事業，他的太子娶了西育姆的女兒，他又把女兒嫁給蒂格里另一首領古格薩，他滿望藉這兩件聯姻，永遠銷除北部和中央間的嫌隙，他究竟成功到什麽地步呢？自從一九一六年發生暴力政變，今皇（太法里Tafari）隱然成爲阿比西尼亞的統治者以後，蒂格里的首領和中央政府時常發生齟齬，不過從未公然反抗，這多賴阿皇的智力，在他任攝政的時候，第一件事，便是恢復約翰皇後裔蒂格里省知事的職位，這是他們的正當承繼物，但又怕其中的首領權力太大，危及皇位，他把該省分爲東西兩部，於是西育姆便管轄西蒂格里省，以阿杜華爲都會，他的堂弟而也是素所深恨的勁敵古夫薩阿里亞，（今投降意軍的是他的兒子）便成了東蒂格里省首領，駐於瑪加爾。這個辦法，在阿皇意中，多少已收效果，因爲阿皇所怕的，唯兩人聯好，協同恢復蒂格里朝，茲因彼此忌妬，而相分裂，便不會進行這種政策。近日阿斯瑪拉有人談起一件趣聞，可以窺見他倆的性情。阿皇曾因爲要使他倆修好起見，特命同到阿京朝見，於是這兩位堂兄弟不得不同道經過伊利特里，而在該處乘船到吉波蒂，再換坐火車入京，每人有武裝戰士百人護衛，此外隨從，有妻妾，主要屬員，男女僕役，和奴隸人等。兩隊先乘汽車到阿斯瑪拉，該埠意總領事爲聯歡起見，邀請宴會，兩領袖初不肯會面，經再三商勸，才肯同席而坐。當進餐的當兒，各不相顧，直至將近散宴，交換幾杯香檳酒以後，才慢慢地軟化。臨了，彼此歡然握手而別。但這種和諧，其實不過爲外表之事，假使出於眞情，阿比西尼亞最近的歷史，便要和今日大不相同了。當皇后淑第圖退位，太法里任攝政的時候，國內分成兩黨，一擁護皇后，一擁護攝政，兩堂兄弟（古格薩和西育姆）當然分立，只要一人附和皇后黨，便是使另一人和攝政黨開始陰謀。反之，也只要一人附和攝政黨，便足使另一人和皇后黨開始陰謀。」</p>
<p>因爲兩人又相對抗，因此一九二九年底發生的大亂，才能平穩渡過，那時阿皇改革的企圖釀成一種擾攘狀態，僅賴他努力實施一九二八年和意國簽定的條約，才能撥亂爲治。各省知事，都抱怨望，全國法紀，蕩然無存，叛亂的首領便是古格薩沃里埃。他是皇后的前夫，中阿姆哈拉的領袖，阿皇先以榮譽屈服的種種機會，給與叛黨，後來他的勸告和皇后的勸吿却吿失敗，他便决痛勦，召集皇軍，由陸軍大臣穆魯希太將軍指揮。又命北部諸省的首領都出兵進攻，皇軍中只有愛納將軍會戰勝數次，北部諸省頒袖都服役皇命，得勝而歸，各携有大批戰利品，其中西育姆和古格薩阿里亞尤爲出力。愛納將軍精於韜略，又得法國飛行家一人爲助，擊敗叛黨，殺其首領，目下正在北部抵抗意軍，軍事專家都　他爲阿國指揮中最有將才者</p>
<p>諸首領在亂事始終，表面雖都傚忠，但蒂格里的首領所抱的態度，尤其是古格薩阿里亞，很不可信。他有秘密煽動亂事的嫌疑，又因離婚，被人輕視，他的前妻，是阿皇親愛的姪女，後來他得病死了，其子繼職，阿皇心中，大爲寬慰，以爲子必比父易於駕馭，所以便將女兒嫁他。不意此子今竟投降意軍，足徵阿皇錯信其人。其實古格薩對其岳父，並無多大感情，而阿皇對於其人，也不很信任，古格薩漠視妙齡之妻，任令病死，阿皇蓄恨於心，永不能忘。當日阿皇聞愛女在遠方蒂格里病篤消息，卽派希臘人御醫乘飛機前往救治，但已太遲，飛機後載郡主遺骸回京安葬，此事可證明阿皇很不滿意於其婿的寡情。阿皇雖仍許古格薩任東蒂格里省知事，但中心終不釋然，所以在下總動員令時，並未以獨立指揮權授給其婿，而令歸西育姆將軍節制。西育姆却是古格薩本人並且是其父的勁敵，古格薩此次叛降意軍，大約卽因爲怨恨阿皇猜疑的原故，但主要的動因，大約還是欲借此破壞旭亞皇朝。再者，古格薩或以爲傾向意國，是增進他永久利益的最佳途境，因爲蒂格里如長在意國保護之下，定須立一君主爲傀儡，任何人輔助意軍者，顯然對此有優先權，古格薩的叛離，有無其他首領步其後塵，今尙不能决定，如果只有他一人呢，那便沒有什麼關係，假使有其他首領響應，那便難說了，</p>

<p>結果三對一佔先　今日四組打單賽</p>
<p>第七屆國際公展杯手球賽、於昨日下午五時三刻在西靑球塲展幕、原定五塲單打、嗣以華鳳崗因事未克登塲、經雙方同意、改於今日舉行、昨日四組中、中華僅勝其一、最可惜者、厥爲第一第三兩組之失敗、惟在第一循環中尙有六組單打及五組雙打、如中華隊能出其全力以對付、當不難剿滅囂張一時之戎師、</p>
<p>洪玉魁大快人心</p>
<p>昨日舉行者、係第七·第三·第一·及第九四組、第七組洪玉魁對掰列納爾首先登塲、洪乃中青隊臺柱之一、屢克强敵、曾一度獲得全滬華人公開錦標、去年與朱寬合作、又得全滬雙打公開錦標、年富力强、區區掰列納爾、遠非其敵、上塲後即用其大刀闊斧之擊法、勢如破竹、以廿一對十七、廿一對十二連取兩局、勝來易如反掌、</p>
<p>嚴培秋技高力弱</p>
<p>第三組嚴培秋對來金比、來素有牛皮糖之稱號、血嚴則技均過人、故實力堪稱相等、第一局之比數、非常接近、至廿二對廿、始獲勝、第二局起嚴以十二對十九落後、運用巧技、努力反攻、得十九平局、方期一帆風順、奈奮勇過度、精力已疲、被來金連獲兩球、成各一平局、略事休息後、各出全力、以爭勝負關頭之第三局、嚴出手順利、以十八對十三佔先、緊要關頭、嚴氏忽脚部抽筋、實力大損、反被來金以廿一對十九力克第三局、可謂不幸之至、</p>
<p>朱球王輕敵失手</p>
<p>手球界之朱寬、不啻足球界之李惠堂、而卻克令者、亦西青之主將、兩雄相遇、競爭必烈、無如　戰開始後、朱以輕敵太過、失去首局、第二局中、朱顯出其擊　壓殺諸絕技、以廿一對五、還報顏色、第三局之勝負關頭、朱曾以十九對十六佔先、方期勝利在握、無如惡運臨頭、竟被却克令連以絕險低球追成平手、最後兩球、其兇險更非人力所能挽救、以最佳之優勝局勢、竟功虧一實而慘敗、朱以常勝將軍著稱、遭此打擊、懊喪可想矣、</p>
<p>三對一西青佔先</p>
<p>中華隊連遭兩次打擊、士氣沮喪、治第九組孫　琦對掰許登塲、孫氏負雲叱咤、勇猛非凡、第一局屢　險境、均以巧着制勝、使掰許搖頭太息、甘拜下風、第二局起、更形緊張、孫氏沉着應戰、屢着先鞭、無如後半局中、掰許着着進逼、孫則氣力漸衰、終於失之交臂、造成平局、迨第三局係巳精疲力盡、雖竭力應戰、已難挽殘局、遂以二對一被掰許獲勝、總結第一日共賽四塲、西靑以三對一佔先各局成績及今日秩序如後、</p>

<p>稱西湖爲風景區，毋寗易之曰弔古區。緣其地一寺一橋，一山一花，咸因人而名。英雄如武穆，忠肅，蒼水，武松，高士如和靖，白石，樊榭，冬心；下如美人蘇小小靑輩，莫不流韵千載，足使湖山增色。故今人言游者，必曰武林：驅轍寄感，諒非僅爲觀賞風景計也。論湖上祠墓，比亦日有增益，微惜近代之所推崇，或非後人之所甚慕無已，則求諸曼殊。按玄瑛黃金揮手，紅粉銷愁，隱於僧，而小拘拘於僧之言之行，非具有善知識大毅力者，弗能也。故吾讀渠集，不奇其詩，而絕愛其人其事。夫士君子因不得志，而高謝區緣，亦已苦矣。乃又不能自歸於平澹寂默之境，是其內心蘊結之鬱憤，寗止塊壘三斗已哉。使有用之者，出其所懷，惆悵嗚咽之氣，未始不可化爲裨益民生之策也。「極目神州餘子盡，袈裟和淚伏碑前。「多謝劉三問消息，尙留微命作詩僧」。然而世之相知者，僅有劉三；可與吿訴者，又爲往代之豪傑，而無從與通　欬者。於是放浪天涯，抑塞以終。其遇至不幸，其人亦因此而差足傳矣。墓在孤山之陰、距西冷橋百數十武，游湖者數數經焉。余曩客湖上，逢休暇，日必驅車至，藉草摩碑，往往至月上始歸。有時聞鳳林鐘聲，自林端出，對此坯土，凄然發人間何世之威！「塵劫紛紛如是觀，收將餘淚待淸時。」自不知爲誰而作也？今秋復與夢蕉幽話其間，念墓草無恙，而彼此已垂垂中年；繁星如雨，淸音發吼，墓中人，儻有知耶？一詩致感，何必定爲渠而說。「滿身秋露看星辰，一杵蒼茫萬迹陳　日課等閑僧自笑，何曾想到聽鐘人？」</p>
<h3 id="c185">劊子手趣談 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>劊子手，大家都知道他是殺人的。因爲從前君主時代，對於一切犯人的處死，都是用那砍頭的辦法。砍頭，那就非劊子手不可了！據說：劊子手的砍頭，也和其他的行業一樣，是需要練習的。他們　習的方法，是用大饅首來試騐，一刀下去，饅首的上半段，必須隨刀滾落。並且他們在饅首上畫一條黑綫，刀鋒須對着這條黑綫？起初的時候，自然不能準確。但是時侯長久，那就可以百無一失，於是充任劊子手，也就可以勝任愉快。</p>
<p>據老年人說：劊子手殺人，只能一刀，如果一刀不死，就不能再砍第二刀，所以劊子手非得練習有素，是不敢貿然上塲—法塲—的。記得我曾聽見過這麼一個故事：「一個强盜，被官廳捉住了，因爲他犯案纍纍，自然是法無可恕，於是把他處了死刑，定期執行。他的老婆，是有姿色的，而且他們夫婦的感情又很好。所以伊總想把他救活。於是伊就犧牲了自己的身體，去結識那個劊子手，並且表示：「不幸有個强盜丈夫，雖然是就要處死，已經嫌遲了！如果劊子手肯要伊的話，伊願意和他作永久的夫妻。」這劊子手當然是願意的。在他丈夫執行的前一夜，伊和劊子手說：我丈夫的辮子很好，請你明天先割下來給我作假髮。劊子手已經被伊迷住，對於伊的話，自然是奉命惟謹。所以第二天殺伊丈夫的時候，先一刀割下他的辮子，正欲再砍他頸子的當兒，那强盜的老婆，突然由人叢中跑了出來喊寃，說是已經殺了一刀了！監斬官沒有辦法，立時把强盜放了下來，把這劊子手作他代表，叫另一個劊子手把他砍了！這時，那劊子手雖然知道上了伊的大當，但是已經遲了！</p>

<p>— 方正</p>
<p>記得是前幾天吧！本報第二張，曾載着一篇豐子愷先生的二重生活，說「……一方面報上登着離婚，一方面却在建築節婦坊……新綫式的汽車旁，也會有四人抬的官轎走過，這便是所謂中國人的二重生活……」但我這裏所記的，却更要勝過二重生活一籌哩！事實是這樣。</p>
<p>本月十日，我們這個小鄉鎭上——引翔港——突然的熱鬧起來，一般男女老幼的鄉民們，各自很虔敬地捧着一柱綫香，在人羣裏擁擠，幾乎要把這條狹隘的小街道擠破了；假使你要拿形容詞來形容他們，那末只有「人山人海」，足當之無愧了。這樣的熱鬧，在我們這個小鄉鎭上，還只第一次哩！但是熱鬧的原因，的確使人難以推測，後來問了一個內幕中人（這事的發起者）說是：「土地菩薩結婚！」</p>
<p>「呵！眞奇怪，人才有結婚，菩薩怎可結婚，莫非係開玩笑是不？」我似不信的向他探問，才得了他告訴我的一段奇聞：</p>
<p>「本鎭王家觀音堂北面，有一所土地廟，內有一位菩薩，因爲得了一般鄉民的信仰，所以時常有人去燒香膜拜，上月二十七日，有個少女，也去燒香，當伊膜拜已畢，剛站起的時候，突然笑了一笑，不料就被菩薩看中了，果然那少女回家不久，就得病死了。爲了這個緣故，伊母親懷疑一定是給土地菩薩討去做小老婆了，於是就替伊製造了這個木像，擇定了今天（好日），替他們倆結婚了。」</p>
<p>當我聽完了這段奇聞，不禁連聲嘆息，不但感嘆鄕民迷信得可憐，而且在這農村破產，市面竭蹶的時候，應理不該再有這種無謂的舉動發現了。然而我們中國人却不然！儘管人家把「破除迷信」喊得怎樣厲害，他們始終在做着迷信的幻夢，但是現在却不是這種時代了。說來眞可嘆；前天水災振濟會的童子軍到這鎭上來募捐，分文也捐不着，可是今天的　動，單單是香費的消耗，就達數百元左右呢！中國人那得不窮？那得不給人欺侮？</p>

<p>至於經濟這一類的事，那會是笑話，恐怕什麼叫幣制，什麼叫金本位，你全不明白。你就知道有貨物由你局子面前經過，多多的括人家幾文錢。我根本就瞧不起你，不爲了要錢，十年不通音信，我也不會來找你。這一番痛罵，北海也聽得呆了，有一個做太太的人，這樣的罵老爺的嗎？志前聽着，也是連連的搖了幾下頭，向北海微笑了一笑。北海正想說着什麼，志前向他搖搖手，又向隔壁屋子努努嘴，意思是叫他向下聽了去。於是兩個人對看了一眼，又向隔壁聽着。那局長受了這一番痛罵，似乎不能忍受了，便　到一種短促的　音，答道：這是你說我的話嗎？我這次請假到西安來接你，就十分勉强的。現在要我去拿錢，拿了錢，還要我送來，這來往二四次，要耗費多少工夫。設若上司知道了，把我的差事撤消，我自然是完了，你又能佔着什麽便宜，假如你還打算整千塊的要錢，就打死我，我也拿不出來吧？你要拿錢，那就得跟我到甘肅去。這說話的聲昔，由遠而近，和那婦人發言點很是相近，說着就聽到那婦人不知放擱什麽東西，很重的在桌而子上碰了一下晌，接着道：好的，只要你拿得出錢來，我就陪你到甘肅去。不要這鬼樣子，滾開些。一隔脚步蹌跟聲，那男子又拖着聲音道：那個地方，可比不上西安，吃黑　，喝泥水，連靑菜蘿蔔，都沒有的……（三六六）</p>

<h3 id="c190">漕河涇監獄假釋大批囚犯 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>上海漕河涇江蘇第二監獄，設備周至，規模宏大。監禁人犯，共達二千餘名。男女工塲，共有二十餘所。頃因罪犯日漸增加，頗有人滿之患。當局爲疏通監獄計，特遵照部令，舉辦假釋。第一批呈准假釋出獄者，有一百多名，業已開釋多日。第二三批一百數十名，已分別檢呈高院及警備司令部。第四五批已選定三百餘名，正在趕辦審查手續，不久卽可發出。計此次可假釋人犯，有六七百名之多。並舉行假釋典禮，由典獄長訓話。各犯莫不爲之威動，喜形於色。</p>
<p>我國司法情形之不完備，已爲不可諱言的事實。當局有鑒及此，故近來對於各項缺陷，頗具彌補的决心。如疏通監獄條例的頒布，卽是一例。監禁罪犯，原爲對犯法者的一種懲戒。而立法之意，無非欲使犯罪之徒，受懲戒之後，能改惡爲善。是以世界文明各國，對於犯人，皆取寬容態度。或用敎育以感化之，或執行假釋，以聽其改過，法至善也。今番我國監獄，亦有此假釋之舉，實為一良好現象。</p>
<p>又我國各地監獄，除少數大都市，有新式監獄的創立，其餘舊式監獄，大都設備簡陋，衛生管理各方面，殊欠完善。且監獄規模旣小，人犯又多。監犯所受的痛苦，眞足以人間地獄四字形容之。尤以幾年來社會不景氣的影響，犯罪者日增一日，各地監獄，皆有無法收容之勢。故假釋出獄之舉，實有充分執行的必要。蓋假釋不但可以疏通監犯的擁擠，卽對於戒護上，亦不致發生意外的事件。至其有益於在監人犯的衛生給養，尚為餘事。</p>
<p>且所謂假釋，皆選擇監獄中之罪犯較輕，或入獄後行為合軌，而有改善傾向者，方許其放出。此種人犯，與其拘禁於監獄，不如還其自由之身為得也。在外國，假釋結果，成績均甚優。故我們希望漕河涇監獄此次釋放的六七百名囚徒，出獄後，皆能改變其品行，成為一良善國民。</p>
<p>聞司法行政部，以我國少年犯罪衆多，二十一年度，總計為三千零四入。此項幼年犯，就刑事政策及監獄制度論，均不宜與成年入犯同處。故決定於重要城市，別建監所，使受較完備的敎誨，俾將來出獄後，成為健全的青年。此消息甚屬可喜，實不能不認為我國司法界的一種進步也。</p>

<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>久住在暹羅的人差不多沒有一個人對於暹羅不感到親切的愛好，尤其是它那美麗的風光景物，和趣味的習俗。</p>
<p>輪船駛進蜿蜓曲折的暹羅灣，速率就减低下來，船宛如一頭病象，在綠的可愛灧灔的水面上迂緩地爬着。「哦，到港了，到暹羅港了！」嚷着，全船里都騷動起來。</p>
<p>綠波的兩岸，展開着兩片茫無邊際的椰林，聳入雲霄，濃綠綠的，接連到天際，跟着寳玉似的藍天調和起來。從椰林的油綠的葉子望去，不時地可以瞧見一兩個尖塔頂突聳出葉縫里來，在熱帶的辣毒的陽光映射底下，閃耀着燦爛輝煌的黃金色，芒刺刺的，多麽眩眼的呵！這便是暹羅的佛寺。</p>
<p>兩岸的淺水處，蹬浮着許多成排的木船，穩穩不動地站立着，這些船和普通載貨物的船可有點不一樣：有樓台而且成四方形。船的四周，都用粗大的鐵索緊緊地扣住，祗讓它跟隨潮水浮動，起落，却不肯給它移易了地位，這就是暹羅人的「帕」，——水上的家。</p>
<p>暹羅的女人，也跟着喀厘陵的女人一樣，裸露着上身，讓兩隻乳峯，新墳似的，尖挺挺的一聳一聳地顫動着，毫不羞澀地在街上行走，下身圍繞着一條紅紅綠綠的「奔龍」，（裙子）</p>
<p>入晚，吃過晚飯之後，太陽下了山，天邊還賸一抹殘暉，這時，不分界限，一絲不掛地溜進河里去，河里頓時熱鬧起來，嘩嘩的潑水聲，格格的塡嬌的笑聲，錯雜地交響着。</p>
<p>「潑水」這玩意兒，在暹羅原是極平常的，而且有不少的地方，對於這是認爲一種流行的禮貌。每逢到生客相晤的時候，不分男女，雙方務必用冷水互潑得遍身淋漓，只要身邊有水可潑的時候，不如此，不足以表示親熱。就是碰到毫不相識的人，也都可以出其不備地把冷水潑到他（或她）的身上，嘻嘻地站在路旁笑着。</p>
<p>水，在暹羅是一件時刻不可缺少的生命要素之一，茫茫漠漠的水田，不消說需要多量的水去灌溉，同時，因爲熱帶氣候炎熱的緣故，人們經不起辣毒的太陽的曬射，每天要冲了好多趟凉。他如人死後，除了舉行火葬禮之外，還有一種所謂滴水禮，把死人硬僵僵地陳擺在屋里，拉開右手，這樣來賓就繞行死者一匝之後，在死者的手心上滴下幾滴聖水，於是，滴水禮就算完畢了。</p>
<p>暹羅的男女的婚姻，還有一種極趣味的風俗，在景邁，只要是一個沒有家室的男子，爲求婚姻，他就可以隨意地闖進任何一個不相識的人家，說明了來意之後，那家的未出嫁的姑娘，就得出來陪他坐談。這時，家裏的父母，都避到外室或出門去了，讓他們詳細地暢談着。倘使女的看中了對方，當她親自奉敬他的檳榔樹葉卷的時侯，那卷子是用兩片樹葉卷成的，那末，就算對他表示這婚姻是同意的，於是，男的以後就可以隨意出入女家，睡食女家，而認爲女家的快婿了。</p>
<p>我愛暹羅，愛它的自然風景的美麗，嫻靜；愛它的民性的豪爽，樸素，天眞，不驕揉造作！</p>
<h3 id="c192">夜行車 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>寒冷的氣候帶了晦暗的天，有一個陰陽怪氣的臉吞着地上。</p>
<p>北方，那是高原地帶，氣息是乾燥的，正因爲這，看不見近海的溫濕氣息，當秋天在眼睛里不經意的滑過去以後，風，就會呼呼地叫，許是建設文明還沒有發展到某節階程，街頭，泥土的路面上，灰沙在跟隨着奔跑，嗚嗚像狼嘷又像什麼東西叫，打倒少見玻璃的窗紙上，嘩一陣，又嘩一陣。</p>
<p>守着一盞油燈，在房間的四下里搜索着，這樣，値得依戀，那樣，也値得愛惜，雖說不値什麼錢，可是，家，是將要整個的遷移了，對着那一切舊的什物：襯和昏芒的燈光，一陣凄凉划過了心頭，帶　了一個寒噤。</p>
<p>是的，我捨不得家，不，故鄉，我依慕家鄉里所被人稱道的古樸風韻。</p>
<p>那怎麽能成呢？讓企望先坪藏起來吧！照舊的，我翻　着，裝理着。</p>
<p>冷天，夜是長的，在一切都停當的時候，跨出門，天的臉子依舊黑得可怕，伏在箱蓋上做好了幾封書，窗紙上，染着一絲的灰白。</p>
<p>—二爺，該走了，東車站七點鐘　車！預定好的熟車子闖進來，省些驚慌的樣子，彷彿怪我太大意了。</p>
<p>不准有什麽時間來話別，就這樣的忽忽上路了。晨風，眞可以，打倒臉上像刀子在劃，地面，房頂，緊舖着厚霜，像羊毛的絨毯，車夫的脚踩上未凝固的霜上，靑蛙一樣，會吱哇吱哇的叫。</p>
<p>跟了火車的輪子，跟了那一片房屋草原，故鄉是消失在濃重的晦暗里。</p>
<p>到天津，正在午間的時刻，知道開往上海的船是要到明天潮漲的時侯才能開出的，並且，船不進口，還須要經過一段天津到唐山的火車。呵，糟了，就停留在車站等着天晚麼？還是先到唐山去等候呢？遲疑着一個長久的時間，後來，到底接受了客棧的請求，先到了旅舍。</p>
<p>半天，很快的經過了，船要，也預先的購買下來。</p>
<p>承店主東的好意，吿訴我最好在九點多鐘動身，到唐山至多不過一個多鐘頭馬上就到船上，比先坐在那里久等要好得多了，這種好意，在當時我認爲是難得的，因爲一個沒有出過遠門的人，能够被人家指點給你應該怎樣的去完成了前面的途程，那情形，比送什麽都値得寳貴。</p>
<p>按着囑咐，跳進了九點多鐘開往唐山的車子，這段路稈，本來沒有多長，假使輪船能進口的話，這一段也就極沒有開行的必要，坐車的人，簡直的可以說是寥寥無幾的，茶房圍了一個小的火爐打盹，有幾位仁兄打開了舖蓋蒙了頭在呼呼地進了睡鄉，肅穆包圍了車子，除掉那輪子和軌道磨動的聲音，有時攙合了幾聲汽笛以外，什麽音響都沒有的。</p>
<p>大約在一刻鐘以後，查票員來了，把仁兄從被蓋里拖出來，叫他們遵守規章，但一轉眼，他們照舊的躺了下去，嘴里還不住的喞咕着。</p>
<p>來到了我的面前，照樣的把票子上作了一個記號，一回頭，看見米袋里裝有東西。</p>
<p>—這是什麽？腔聲怪嚴厲的。</p>
<p>—爐子，小號的。</p>
<p>這樣，他彷彿發現了什麽秘密似的，立時伸出手來拉開了麻袋的口看了一下：</p>
<p>—過磅沒有？</p>
<p>沒有。</p>
<p>—不成，這種東西是要過磅的。他把臉沉下來，思索了一會：那末，就補票吧！</p>
<p>—多少錢？</p>
<p>—哼，大約××斤，得，就兩塊四吧！</p>
<p>這是一個打擊，雖說這小爐子是我心愛的，但，買價不過兩元，現在，居然要出到高於買價的運資，當然不肯馬虎的就接受下來。</p>
<p>—沒有那麼多錢，聽憑你處置吧！</p>
<p>—從窗口丟出去！他命令着一個同來的人。臉子，轉成了紫色。</p>
<p>—也好，免得我累贅。我到非常的坦然。</p>
<p>也要，他想不到我有這一手，一時，他竟回不過嘴來，看一下他的臉，顯着非常的尬尷。</p>
<p>後來，由車子里的人當中勸說，出了六毛錢的代價衝過了關口。</p>
<p>接了錢，他的怒色還沒有退，拉開了門，躥到另一個車廂里去。</p>
<p>一陣寒風刷過來，禁不住的打了幾個寒噤，玻璃窗外，一片的漆黑，車頭上的笛子拉長了聲音喊着。</p>

<p>月淡風凄夜霧濃。一燈如水悶重重。獨對孤燈腸欲斷。翠眉雙鎖淚珠濃。想我是，春雨梨花悲命薄。終身誤配恨無窮。丈夫是，終日遊蕩無職業。紙醉金迷如夢中。俾晝作夜昏嫖賭。深宵方始轉家中。揮霍金錢如糞土。將祖遺產業典賣空。全不念。子女長大須求學。而今是，可憐躭誤在家中。我是，幾次苦口將他勸。可恨他，忠言逆耳當作風。可憐我，書香門庭　金女。幼年嬌養在閨中。如今是，主持　務親操作。到晚來，燈下還要作女紅。深宵不睡將門守。寂寂深閨恨萬重。滿腔心事憑誰訴。傷心時常淚滿胸。坐吃山空從古道。家境蕭條日漸窮。子女饑寒悲啼哭。觸目傷心愁更濃。我欲思自立謀職業。可歎世態炎凉人心凶。想我是，幼讀詩書知禮義。三從四德常記胸。怎能學那，摩登女子一般同。含辛茹苦度歲月。撫育兒女盡我衷。痴心常將香一炷。暗把心事訴蒼穹。願良人，回頭早把身心束。光耀門楯振家風。免得我，書空咄咄愁重重。</p>

<p>這年頭兒，社會不景氣，許多有爲的靑年，部給惡劣的環境迫成了壞人，尤其是意志薄弱時年靑的娘兒們。徐來在船家女中，本是一個純潔的女子，每天和她老父，在西子湖中盪船着兒，純良地過着生活。可是美麗的西子湖，也會受了市面不景氣的影響，遊客是越來越希少了，和其它的欠債的人們一般，他們每月不能償還划船的租費，在船主大胖子譚志還凶橫的逼迫之下，老父受傷了，徐來亦在大胖子的掌握之中了，終於成了俎上肉，而作了一個出賣肉體的神女了。每天受着鞭撻與飢餓，忍着羞恥和侮辱，在送往迎來中，捱過長長的歲月。徐來是神女嗎？不，她只是給惡劣的環境葬送了的一個弱女子！</p>

<p>好萊塢的影業鉅子，他們很明瞭那大衆的口味，時常在轉變的。所以，他們也就時常去尋找新的東西來刺激大衆，選擇演員，亦復如是。過去的希佛萊，和現在將在大光明戲院開映「愛情萬歲」Here＇stoRomance的主角聶諾馬鐵尼，就是一個很好的例子。</p>
<p>這兩位歌星，都是由本片的監製者吉西拉斯加把他們由歐洲引到美國來的。希佛萊巳經靠着他那輕鬆的表演，爵士音樂的風調，成功了銀幕上的唯一大情人了。現在當着希佛萊回到法國去的時候，他們又想到這位巳經在舞台上成了名的馬鐵尼了。馬鐵尼的歌喉，卡羅索而後，堪稱首屈一指。拉斯加因此又把他當作新的東西，來刺激電影觀衆了。</p>
<p>這片子完成以後，在美國公映的時候，果然轟動一時，影業巨子的理想，遂又實現。他們爲了帮助馬鐵尼的成功，還到歐洲去找了幾個著名的歌星和舞星來配演，成功一個非常完美的音樂羅曼斯，它所以能轟動一時的，却並非偶然的事情。總之馬鐵尼又以一個新的典型，在銀上幕建樹奇功了。</p>

<p>一·弁言</p>
<p>陣亡將士公墓：包括大門，圍牆，牌樓，祭堂，紀念館，紀念塔，及公墓三座。</p>
<p>本工程係中央黨部紀念先烈撥欵建築，由陳委員果夫等負責蕆事。位於靈谷寺鐘山之麓，總理陵寢之東，地處幽靜，風景秀麗；於民國二十年三月間開工，至二十三年五月始全部完成。其開工時因建築師對於模型欲使其像眞仿古，審愼考慮：致稍延時日。今者莊嚴偉大之工程已吿成，爰將工程經過，分述於後。</p>
<p>二·各項工程</p>
<p>A紀念塔</p>
<p>塔為八角形，凡九層，由平台面至尖頂高二百英呎，中置鋼骨水泥盤梯，可直達九層。每層週圍游廊，圍以獨塊雕成之蘇石欄桿，費工殊巨。每層內部橫樑及邊樑，均粉以顏色水泥，該項顏色水泥，用代北平彩畫，尙屬創舉。蓋普通係彩畫繪成，不久顏色勢必减退，該項顏色水泥，則可永久不變；惟初拌和時，殊費手續，經數拾次之試騐，始吿完成。因其成分視各種顏色，而定所和黃砂水泥之多寡：否則乾後必有裂縫，及色澤不同之弊也。</p>
<p>地點審定後，卽開始挖掘底脚，其深度按照圖樣須挖至發現大石爲止，惟挖至拾四尺深。尙未見有整石，繼續再挖至拾八尺半，仍復如是，但其土質似已半化爲石，亦殊堅硬。經工程師詳查石層傾斜度，如欲發現石層不知將於胡底：乃試做載重試騐，每方尺竟可載重四噸半强，經一星期後仍未稍陷。工程師認爲滿意，此第一步工作乃遂吿成。其搗水泥則自底脚至頂，均以機器拌和。至塔下之四週大平台，直徑一百呎，亦爲八角形；均舖蘇石板，底襯鋼骨水泥。平台石板，與水泥接鑲處，均滿灌冰泥漿，四週圍以蘇石欄杆；並有石級四乘。而正面中問，鑲以極大陛石；上刻黨徽，下鐫山水，山作三峯，所以表示三民主義；水則表示自由平等也。刻工精細無比。所有石料，做成光面或欄杆等，如發現微痣或不平正之處，本廠不惜工本，不惜費時費事，廢棄重做，以求萬全；惟前所訂時之尺碼塊數，均有定數，偶有不合用，勢非另定不可；而延長時間，又所難免矣。</p>
<p>其他屋面，蓋以綠色廣東琉璃瓦，瓦係事先定製，均擇其色澤鮮明而無斑點者應用之，以資顏色均勻。塔頂係生鐵鑄成，外用電鍍眞金。塔尖之避雷針，用純紫銅作三尖式，以粗大之電綫拾一根拾陸號接通地下，並置一塊二方尺紫銅片，接於雷綫之地下另一端。</p>
<p>塔之最下一層，肆面大碑上寫有蔣委員長親筆「精忠保國」肆字：正面橫額上「陣亡將士紀念塔」七字，亦係蔣委員長之親筆；具見其敬愛忠魂之赤忱！除下層外，其餘八層，每層加嵌有石碑各肆，內外滿鐫總理黃埔開學詞，吿別詞，蔣委員長黃埔同學錄序及遺阡表，均係現代名人手筆。</p>
<p>下層大門四扇，以三角鐵作架，外包一分原之整塊銅皮作面，並釘以一吋六分之半圓形銅釘。</p>
<p>B紀念館</p>
<p>位在塔前，距離約五百尺，亦卽誌公塔舊址之前面也。</p>
<p>該館長一百三拾陸呎陸吋，闊陸十四呎八吋，四週作長走廊，館作宮殿式。二層屋面亦用廣東琉璃瓦，畫棟彫梁；悉仿古宮殿。惟稍異者，樑柱木與水泥之分耳。該館完工期在紀念塔之前，凡九個月，內部花大料及平頂等，悉與紀念塔同，恕不復贅。</p>
<p>C祭堂</p>
<p>前名無樑殿，後改無量殿，今名陣亡健兒忠魂祭堂。本係舊屋修建者，前毀於太平天國之役，自始建迄今，已具五百餘年之歷史；委員會因爲保存古跡起見，特將該殿重修，改爲陣亡健兒忠魂祭堂。堂長二百十尺，闊一百念餘尺，前傾圯已大半，屋　具毀；現已照原樣修復，莊嚴偉大；無與倫比　內分三大法圈，中間最大。全以古城磚用一，二水泥側砌而成，上覆二吋半鋼骨水泥以連成一片，再上每縱十三呎，加一大料。下隧圈形式：上跟屋面坡度，中圈高約五十餘呎，闊可四十呎强，中無一柱支撑，故昔命名無樑殿也。屋面瓦片亦照舊有式樣，蓋　長十六呎，闊七，厚六分，底瓦長厚同，闊爲十四呎，全黑色，在蘇州定製。地舖二十呎方京磚，亦係蘇州所定製。窗與門係生熟鐵所鑄，分噴古銅色，以純銅粉和以顏色，用機器熱噴；蓋可保持永久也。牆之內外四週，木粉以石灰，以不能顯現古磚，故將舊有粉刷完全刷去，再以水泥嵌縫，方可表示其古磚之厚大也。內牆四週，半腰鑲以靑石，滿刻陣亡將士姓名。</p>
<p>D公墓</p>
<p>墓分左右中三處：中央最大，半經一百九十二呎圓形外，再加以大半圈，及小半圈，全墓似荷花式。當測量劃綫時，殊費事費時：蓋滿地盡草萊樹木也。位置既定，卽開始挖掘牆脚，隨地勢之高祗而定標準；士旣挖成，乃下石灰三合土一，三，六，水泥等。牆面工程，係用預先搗成之冰泥板砌成，長三五，不等，厚四寸，高可一呎。每砌一層，（背面同）中鑲磚頭，然後再砌第二層尺直至頂上，砌法相同，全牆砌成後，乃進行第三步工作，將內外牆斬成石樣，卽可謂假石。墓成，乃舉北伐以來之陣亡將士遺骸，安葬於其中。</p>
<p>E牌樓</p>
<p>作五重式水泥墩六只，下半段鑲刻花蘇石，上部全假石。搗水泥須同時將一，二，細砂附於壳子板旁搗數吋，直至頂上均同。斗拱係預先搗就，斬成假石，然後放置。其上亦爲廣州琉璃瓦。</p>
<p>F大門圍牆</p>
<p>大門爲洞門，落地全舖蘇石板，蘇石勒脚。旁連圍牆全長三百餘呎，兩端有圓門，東門上額「昭烈」，西門上額「揚忠」，全牆粉紅色水泥，牆頂蓋顏色琉璃瓦，勒脚係蘇石與起石各半。花大料廣東瓦悉與紀念館回：恕不復贅。</p>
<p>三·結論</p>
<p>上列各工程，本廠均不惜工本，精益求精；每稍有不妥之處，卽設法更換或重做。良以中央赤忱紀念忠魂埋骨之地；本廠亦國民一份子，自當體中央之至意，以慰忠烈之英魂；不敢率爾從事也。今幸大功吿成，爰將工程經過，瀝陳如右。</p>

<p>— 耿龍根</p>
<p>美國政府對於國內建築，一向是非常重視；試觀美國建築事業的發達，占全世界的第一位，卽可以想見，美國政府一方面拿出鉅大數額的金元，來建築與社會有所影響的建築，另一方面則盡其力量來帮助與鼓勵人民建築，民主黨執政以後，對於此種政策，尤爲努力，最値得說的，就是在去年夏天做的兩件事—組織一個聯邦建築管理處和將修正的新建築條例公布。</p>
<p>聯邦建築管理處的工作，乃是秉承新建築條例的意志，對人民建築房屋時予以充份的經濟上與技術上的帮助，管理員係莫非德J．S．Moffett氏，該處創辦至今，已有一年，成續頗爲可觀，（按莫非德氏乃羅斯福總統的親信；今年初夏曾受羅總統委託來上海非正式調查中國白銀現狀與建築事業。）</p>
<p>聯邦建築管理處不但帮助人民建築新屋，並且還帮助舊屋的修理與改造，創辦時管理員莫氏曾對新聞記者聲稱：美國共有一千三百萬房屋需要修理，三百萬房屋需要少許修理，我等希望於最近的將來，設法帮助這些屋王在其本地金融機關借欵，以改良其房屋，使居住安全與舒適。</p>
<p>並不是聯邦建築管理處直接借欵與人民，聯邦建築管理處不過替人民接洽好許多金融機關設立建築抵押借欵，並需量設法保護出借者出借的欵項穩靠。</p>
<p>因爲用途的不同，此種建築抵押借欵分爲兩種：一種借與建築新屋者，一種借與修理或改造舊屋者，建築新屋借欵的數目能借到一萬六千元，修理舊屋則自一百元起至二千元爲止，抵押品就是欲求借欵的房屋與地產，除非與國家法律違觸，可無須保瞪人，利息大多五釐，但亦有因地方狀况而增至六釐，另外再加保險費半釐或一釐，歸還的方法是分期拔付，分期拔付的時間，可長至二十年之久。</p>
<p>借欵的方法，頗爲容易，借欵者預先請建築師代爲估計需要欵項的數目，然後以此估計持至當地設立或經理此種借欵的金融機關請求借欵，倘此種估計被審查允許後，卽能將所需的欵項借到，手續簡單，並無虛文惡例等周折。</p>
<p>歸還以每月拔付最爲普通，每次還欵時，除本利以外，還要付半釐或一釐的保險費，由出借人代借者爲其房屋保險，萬一借欵人的房屋發生意外時，那末卽可得一筆保險公司的賠償費，出借人可免受損失。</p>
<p>倘借欵人對借欵不履行歸還時，出借人得請求聯邦建築管理處應用國家的力量，令其歸還。</p>
<p>自去年聯邦建築處成立與修正的新建築條例公布以後，一般與建築有直接關係的建築師與材料商等的事業，都有很多的進步。</p>
<p>我國也有幾家商業銀行設立建築借欵的，我希望政府能帮助此種事業普及。</p>
<h3 id="c209">住宅的門與垣（下） <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 橫由磐著陳茵譯</p>
<p>（續二十三日本埠增刋　十版）</p>
<p>從今日的社會狀態或建築的式樣考之，幾分開放的庭園總比從來的非開放的庭園較爲必要。若單爲外部與內部有明顯的區劃或爲防備孩子和家畜的妄亂出入爲足，則可謂再好也沒有。可是，對此的希望也許過於苛求也未可知。在此，對垣的設計第一，外觀與實用的兼顧實爲重要。</p>
<p>其次重要者乃須與建築，庭園取釣合調和。例如對色瓦，泥板石，葺的洋式建築與純日本式的冠木門或舟板塀全不相應。同樣的，純日本建築的書院造作或茶室造作說是如何的堅牢，可是用重苦的無趣味的煉瓦造作或用混凝土造作那樣也是不調和不釣合。又在大的方面說，對於莊重的建築還是低的沈着的好，同樣，對於高的建築太過於低像是沈下那樣則不好。</p>
<p>至於材料的選擇亦必須考究。一般住宅的門與垣所用的材料甚多，如混凝土，煉瓦，鐵材，木材，又樹木等等，可是，此等材料因依其位置，建築庭園等或經濟的關係各各有得失之處，所以何者爲最好實無法斷定，可是，大體上門與垣的材料具有必要的條伴。卽合於經濟的富有耐久性的且須有外觀之美。若從這點言之，則普通的生垣等實最爲理想的材料。蓋造作生垣比較廉價，整理式樣良好，富耐久性又在任何建築，庭園都較調和，且具有四季變化，此爲其他材料所莫及的。</p>
<p>然而，其他材料也有他的用塲，有他的長處，於某程度亦可補其缺點，所以應以其地方最經濟的最接近的求之爲妥。</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the formal establishment of the Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee in Tongxian by the twenty-two counties of Eastern Hebei, the chairman, Yin Rugeng, has now specifically ordered all county magistrates to promptly submit all regular and miscellaneous taxes owed to the provincial treasury to this committee within three days.

<p>Tongzhou The Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee Office of Eastern Hebei is located in the Confucian Temple in Tongzhou. All Kuomintang slogans posted in various places have been torn down by the security team. (Telegraphic Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Rugeng, who formerly served as the special commissioner of the Ji-Mi District, has been running around the war zone for days with ulterior motives. After much brewing, he publicly announced the autonomy of the war zone area under his control in his own name on the morning of the 25th. The full text of the telegram was received in the capital on the 25th, and the content slanders the central government's policies in many ways and is extremely absurd. According to diplomatic sources, after the government received this telegram and realized the conspiracy, it has solemnly stated that the law does not allow it and that actions will be taken. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The armistice zone that issued a self-governance declaration and completed the form of an independent state held its first day of autonomous administration today. The chairman, Yin Rugeng, urgently summoned the magistrates of the twenty-two counties under his jurisdiction this morning, and explained the fundamental policy of governance. This morning, the county magistrates arrived in Tongzhou one after another to attend the temporary office of the committee. (Telegraphic Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Each county government in the war zone has hired an additional Japanese liaison officer. After being announced by the special commissioner's office, they have taken office separately. Cai Zhuzheng, the liaison officer of Zunhua, and Tanaka Jiro of Funing, both took office on the 22nd of this month. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After holding his inauguration ceremony, Yin Rugeng immediately telegraphed the chairmen of the five provinces of North China and the mayors of the three cities, urging them to join the autonomous group. (Japan United News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng will reside in Tongzhou for a long time to be responsible for handling various affairs. He will organize an office in Tangshan, appointing Yin Tixin as the director. The Luan-Yu and Ji-Mi district offices have ceased operations since yesterday and are scheduled to be completely closed by the end of this month. The area under the committee's jurisdiction, in addition to the eighteen counties in the Luan-Ji districts, also includes the four counties of Changping, Xianghe, and Baodi, which are so-called war zone border areas. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In response to Yin Rugeng's autonomy, the Hebei Provincial Government, in addition to telegraphing the central government to request instructions, also telegraphed Song Zheyuan, requesting him to stop it nearby. The central government also sent a telegram to Ping tonight with instructions. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) One company of Zhao Lei's unit, the Fourth Security Corps of the War Zone in Tangshan, entered Lutai from Tangshan on the night of the 25th, transferring to Ninghe, intending to forcibly take over the county on behalf of Yin Rugeng. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Before receiving the order to close, the Luan-Yu District Office issued a notice to Tongxian on the 24th, ordering it to properly protect local security and strictly prohibit the creation of rumors and disturbances. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Many county magistrates in the war zone have expressed dissatisfaction with Yin Rugeng's announcement of an autonomous rebellion and are successively returning to the province. It is heard that the magistrates of Linyu, Leting, and several other counties have already arrived. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Lei, the commander of the Fourth Security Corps in Hebei stationed in Tangshan, convened more than 40 people from industry, commerce, and education in Tangshan City on the afternoon of the 25th to announce the meaning of the "War Zone Independent Autonomy Movement." Subsequently, notices were posted in important locations within the city. Since the afternoon of the 25th, the headquarters has dispatched personnel to monitor various tax revenue agencies, railway factories, and postal and telephone bureaus in the city, without yet setting a date for takeover. Furthermore, Yin Tixin, the director of the office of the pseudo-Eastern Hebei "Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee" in Tangshan, arrived in Tangshan from Tongzhou at 8:00 PM on the 25th to prepare everything, and it is said that it will be formally established in the next few days. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Baoding) The provincial government's attitude towards the announcement of autonomy in the counties of the war zone is very determined, believing that it does not have a significant impact on the overall situation in North China. However, because the tax revenue from the counties in the war zone has stopped being remitted to the province, it is heard that the provincial government has not only telegraphed the central government to request instructions, but also ordered the county magistrates and security corps to disregard the rebellious orders and do their utmost to maintain local security in accordance with their duties. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tongzhou The Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government was formally established in a small house in the Confucian Temple here this morning. The ceremony was presided over by Yin Rugeng and was extremely hasty. Neither flags were hung nor cannons were fired, because the new country had not yet made a flag, so there was no flag to hang, and its largest weaponry was the security team's Mauser rifles, so there were also no cannons to fire. After the Reuters reporter arrived and went to meet with local Chinese and foreign intellectuals, they were completely unaware of the changes in the political situation, let alone that they were now living in a new capital. Outside the Confucian Temple, where history is being made, there were no cheers from the people, nor were any crowds gathered. In a long and narrow room, with old-fashioned coal stoves placed by the paper-covered windows, nine people sat silently, formally taking office and establishing the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Committee. Outside the door stood six security team members and several Chinese and foreign reporters from Beiping. The entire city of Tongzhou was peaceful, and traffic between Ping and Tong was normal, with trains running uninterrupted. The outside world knew last night that Yin Rugeng had announced autonomy, but the people of Tongzhou only heard the news this morning. There is an American school here with fifty or sixty foreign students, and classes were held as usual today, as if they were unaware of this major event. However, the nine-person administrative council of the new government, with Yin Rugeng as chairman, includes five security team leaders. After holding the establishment ceremony, Yin denied to the Reuters reporter that the Eastern Hebei autonomy was caused by Japanese pressure or that the new government was a sabotage of the Tanggu Agreement. He claimed that he had telegraphed the leaders of the five provinces of North China, asking them to jointly organize a North China autonomous government. If they did not participate, he would implement autonomy himself. Apart from salt tax and customs duties, the new government would take over everything else, including the railways. When the reporter asked about the future of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and foreign industries in the region, Yin said that there would be no changes. Yin also claimed that he had a total of 16,000 security team members and 10,000 soldiers under his command. If necessary, he could recruit an additional 100,000 people and provide them with rifles. Yin finally said that since the new government has been established, the Administrative Commissioner's Office has now been abolished, and the new government will be responsible for maintaining public security and protecting foreigners. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee announced its establishment at 8:00 AM this morning at the Confucian Temple in Tongxian. The heads of the seven departments under its jurisdiction gathered in the main hall. First, Chairman Yin Rugeng delivered a speech, and then a meeting was held, which ended at around 10:00 AM. Huo Shi, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Department, visited Takahashi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, ​​and explained: 1. Reported on the establishment process; 2. Advocated breaking away from party rule but not leaving China; 3. Made every effort to maintain local security; 4. Was responsible for protecting foreign nationals, and other four points. Committee member Yin Tixin took a car to Tianjin at noon to visit Japanese officials and made the same statement. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>

According to reports, the Japanese troops between Gubeikou and Yuguan each have a division freely coming and going, but because of the provisions of the Tanggu Agreement, it is not convenient to intervene; 9. Whether all parties will respond to this committee, I have not considered it and will definitely implement its claims; 10. Whether this committee will hire Japanese advisors has not yet been decided, and the county magistrates under its jurisdiction will also not be changed; 11.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of the Army has not received accurate information about Yin Rugeng's declaration of autonomy. According to the Army's opinion, forcibly suppressing the autonomous anti-communist committee will only disrupt public security. Therefore, they are observing the situation. It is still questionable whether Yin has the strength to control the overall situation in North China, so its future will inevitably be serious. (Japan News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also not received an official telegram from Yin Rugeng declaring autonomy and is unwilling to express any opinion. However, because the area where the autonomy declaration was made is an armistice zone, it has a significant impact on North China, and its future is taken seriously. They are also concerned about the Chinese government's attitude towards it and how the people of North China will be affected. (Japan United News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(London) The Morning Post wrote an article analyzing the Far Eastern situation, stating that the power of Japanese militarists is growing day by day. Although this is due to constitutional means, all those who truly love Japan cannot but regret it. Moreover, although the truth behind the recent incidents in North China is still obscure and unclear, what we are deeply convinced of is that Sino-Japanese relations are so complex that it is more reliable to have them handled by diplomats. On the contrary, military authorities are often limited by short-sighted interests and deceived by the moment. It would be extremely dangerous to let them resolve the current situation of conflict. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department received the news of the Eastern Hebei declaration of autonomy today and is paying close attention to it. It seems to have genuine worries, but it does not want to rush to criticism until it receives an official report on the matter. According to some observers, the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Committee's intention to take over the section of the Beining Railway that passes through the demilitarized zone seems to contain the seeds of possible conflict. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department is currently anxiously reviewing the situation in North China. It is heard that it intends to continue to consult with the British authorities, and it is expected that a cooperative policy will be adopted. Public opinion is now opposed to the gradual division of China. According to the New York Herald Tribune today, the announcement of autonomy in Eastern Hebei is milder than the separation of the five provinces of North China from the central government. Everything that has happened in the past ten days indicates that this is a gesture by the Japanese military leaders stationed in China and Manchuria who disregard the authorities in Nanjing and Tokyo. They believe that they have the power to dispose of the fate of the Asian continent in any way that is beneficial to Japan according to the plans made by the Japanese military.

<p>(Tianjin) At 6:00 AM on the 25th, a people's autonomous group lurking in a certain concession gathered hundreds of people, including more than 200 wearing yellow uniforms, Boy Scout soft caps, and white armbands with the words "North China People's Self-Defense" written on them. Armed with short sticks and water bottles, and carrying two machine guns, they drove more than a dozen heavy trucks to Dongma Road, broke into the No. 1 Official Lecture Hall, and hung red and white cloths in front of the door, with the words "North China People's Self-Defense Corps Dare-to-Die Team Headquarters" and "North China People's Self-Defense Corps Dare-to-Die Team" written on them. Machine guns were set up in the street. Then, divided into several groups, they marched in formation from the Official Lecture Hall, either on foot or by car, led by a certain foreigner, parading and demonstrating along Dongma Road via Hebei Jingang Bridge and Dajing Road, chanting slogans. Those in uniforms were in the front, and those in plain clothes were in the back. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Public Security Bureau police did not dare to stop the pseudo-people's group that was petitioning. The brigade went to the New Railway Station, then split into several groups and went to the Municipal Government on Yuewei Road. The first group, with 40 people in plain clothes and more than 20 in uniforms, arrived at the gate of the Municipal Government in two cars. They got out of the car and claimed to be the People's Self-Defense Corps, asking to see Mayor Cheng Ke. At that time, it was 8:40 AM, and Cheng had not arrived at the office. The people in the office reported to Secretary-General Sun Runyu. Sun rushed to the scene and invited the so-called representatives, more than 20 people in plain clothes and eight people in uniforms, in and asked them their intentions. Wu Wenru, Wu Wanxiang, Wang Zhupo, and others, acting as leaders, stated that they wanted the mayor to realize autonomy, and left a petition, demanding the return of power to the people. Sun agreed to convey the message. The people in plain clothes then left, but the people in uniforms stayed in the guest room and refused to leave. Sun then telegraphed Ikegami, the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie, who went with two gendarmerie soldiers and persuaded them to leave. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When the first group was petitioning at the Municipal Government, more than 100 people in plain clothes, including more than half children, arrived at around 9:00 AM, claiming to be the North China Farmers' Self-Help Corps and demanding to see the mayor. Sun Runyu persuaded them to leave. At around 10:00 AM, more than 200 people, a mixture of uniforms and plain clothes, arrived, claiming to be the Qiangxian People's Self-Defense Corps, and sent representatives Yang Bing, Ma Debiao, Yang Yin, and Wang Yating to see Sun Runyu. They stated the same intentions as before and were also persuaded to leave. At 11:30 AM, a fourth group of six or seven people arrived, also claiming to be representatives of the autonomous group, briefly stated their intentions and left. The fifth group arrived at 12:00 PM, with a total of two people, named Bao Yanan and Wang Ming, claiming to be the general representatives of the Hebei People's Autonomous Government. They saw Sun Runyu and were persuaded to leave by Ikegami. There were no more visitors until the afternoon. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At around 11:00 AM, the petitioning brigade turned from the Municipal Government to the Tianjin-Zhan Security Command, gathered in front of the gate, and shouted slogans. The command immediately ordered the special service company to be armed and on alert, commanded by Deputy Officer Wang Xinggang, and detained six of its leaders inside. The soldiers were all indignant and planned to open fire, but Deputy Officer Wang stopped them. Chen Wenhong, the head of the General Affairs Office in charge of the command, had gone to Ping and not returned. Wang then telegraphed Bao for instructions, and the reply was to discuss with the Japanese side. Then, at Ikegami's request, the arrested people were released, and the remaining crowd gradually dispersed. The background of this action is obvious. The commander of the dare-to-die team was Zheng Yanhou, the former commander of the Pseudo-National Salvation First Army who disturbed Luan Dong. Each member of the dare-to-die team was given one yuan a day for expenses and four steamed buns. Most of them were hooligans and rascals from the "three-no-care" area of ​​the South City, all deeply addicted to opium. The petitioning masses were mostly porters, sedan chair carriers, and standard bearers, each receiving four cents a day and four steamed buns. There were also a few people from a certain country participating, so they were very embarrassed. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin mob was still gathering and had not dispersed as of 5:00 PM on the 25th. The Municipal Government is now trying to resolve the situation. It is heard that to maintain security, Tianjin will adopt an invisible martial law method on the night of the 25th, inspecting pedestrians and stopping tram service as early as possible. According to the authorities, the order in Tianjin will not be disrupted. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Pedestrians are prohibited in Tianjin after 10:00 PM, and the concessions are also on alert. All trams have stopped running early. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The crowd that occupied the East Ma Road propaganda office and claimed to be the North China People's Self-Defense Corps Dare-to-Die Team had its banner torn down by spectators in the afternoon. Cheng Ke and Liu Yushu negotiated with the Japanese Army Headquarters, Kwantung Army Special Service Agency, and Japanese Gendarmerie in North China. By 5:00 PM, the team had retreated, returned to a certain tax area, and disbanded. A Japanese gendarmerie soldier was still stationed in the propaganda office, assisting the Public Security Bureau police to prevent anyone from gathering there again under false pretenses. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4:00 PM on the 25th, Cheng Ke went to No. 17 Road in the British Concession to visit Song Zheyuan, and invited Liu Yushu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to discuss measures to maintain security. From 8:00 PM, the streets of the city were under special alert, and plainclothes police officers rode heavy trucks and were stationed at important intersections to prevent trouble. The situation was increasingly tense. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Yushu said that he could not determine the organizational background of the crowd that was disturbing the city today.

If anyone intends to disrupt the situation, even if he has not received orders from the central government, he will spare no effort to sacrifice everything for the sake of his duty.

<p>(Nanjing) After Yin Rugeng claimed independence and issued the so-called telegram, the situation in the Tianjin area suddenly became tense due to the large number of traitors hiding in the area on weekdays. On the 25th, the latest report from Tianjin was received in Beijing, stating that only the First Lecture Hall on Dongma Road had not retreated. A part had gone to the Beining Road Bureau to petition, and had also been persuaded to disperse. The situation would not expand. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 25th, three Japanese aircraft circled over Tianjin in shifts until the autonomy petition ended. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The disturbance in Tianjin lasted all day, and the rioters tried to cause trouble, but their momentum eventually failed. After nightfall, everywhere in Tianjin was peaceful. Early this morning, several hundred rioters, some in plain clothes and some in uniforms, and many carrying weapons, gathered in front of the public office and the Security Command, waving flags and shouting slogans. Then, the rioters gathered in greater numbers and went to Dongma Road and occupied the public lecture hall, and sent people to defend the surrounding area. Then they announced that they would hold a mass meeting to announce autonomy and demand that the authorities withdraw. These rioters, some claiming to be the North China People's Self-Defense Corps, others claiming to be the North China Farmers' Self-Help Corps, and those carrying weapons claiming to be the Dare-to-Die Team, Chinese police and security teams were all dispatched to defend and patrol the streets, obeying the orders of their superiors, but not to open fire. Police stations and Japanese military authorities all sent personnel to the public lecture hall to persuade the rioters to withdraw. Many complied, but 200 members of the Dare-to-Die Team remained. At the same time, demonstrators were found in various places, some rioters in uniforms, wanting to occupy the railway office, but were dissuaded. The rest scattered leaflets and posted slogans, demanding autonomy. Thousands of people watched on Dongma Road, not sympathizing with the rioters, but standing by, initially without malice. But by the afternoon, some people could no longer tolerate it and rushed into the rioters' organization, tearing down their flags and slogans. The dare-to-die team guarding the door looked at each other in dismay and hid in the house. Police elsewhere quickly restored order without difficulty, but traffic on Dongma Road was stopped for some time, and the police could not control the crowds. The rioters in the lecture hall were later persuaded and scattered after abandoning their uniforms. After the rioters left, the spectators also dispersed. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, a member of the War Zone Cleanup Committee, fabricated the so-called "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee Independent Government" by falsely claiming the public will of the people in the Jidong war zone and announced its establishment yesterday. The severity of this absurd and bizarre act is almost equivalent to the Second September 18th Incident. Yin Rugeng, an official appointed by the central government, has engaged in such bold and shameless acts of rebellion. All Chinese people with any sense of national pride must gnash their teeth in hatred and condemn him unanimously. However, what we should pay more attention to is that this kind of pseudo-autonomy movement is not just a simple act of rebellion, but that there are instigators behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held in the capital and military and political leaders from all sides were united in their efforts to overcome the national crisis, foreign telegrams reported that there was a so-called autonomy movement brewing in North China, and that certain three provinces would announce autonomy on the 20th. Most of this news came from a certain party, as if it were conclusive. We knew that the instigators were active behind the scenes to realize their ambition to destroy our sovereignty and territory. However, based on past history, we firmly believe that the responsible authorities in North China will not be threatened or intimidated by powerful forces into committing such an unjust act of becoming puppets. As expected, after the 20th, the so-called autonomy movement subsided. Although this serious disaster ultimately could not be avoided, judging from its scope, it has shrunk compared to what was reported ten days ago. It is even clearer that the more important responsible leaders in North China can deeply understand the overall situation at critical moments and live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country. This is something we can find solace in under today's serious situation.</p>
<p>However, we must know that the reduction in the scope of the pseudo-autonomy organization cannot reduce the seriousness of the incident in the slightest. The endless troubles after this incident have already become apparent in the statements issued by Yin Rugeng and his ilk. What deserves even more attention is that if our nation wants to survive, maintaining the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty is the greatest necessity. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated in his report on foreign policy at the Fifth Plenary Session that our country should "seek political coordination with all friendly nations to the extent that it does not infringe upon sovereignty, and seek economic cooperation with all friendly nations based on the principles of mutual benefit and equality." It is hoped that our central government will take appropriate measures to deal with the Tongzhou incident to live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country.</p>

<p>Athens - King George II of Greece has returned to his homeland after twelve years abroad. When the cruiser "Hellas" he was on entered the port, the capital's people poured into the streets, cheering. The "Hellas" was escorted by two destroyers, "Hydra" and "Psara." The entire port was brightly lit. The King stood on the deck, tears in his eyes, and frequently bowed to the welcoming crowd. The streets of Athens appeared calm, but police patrolled the streets, paying special attention to prominent Republican leaders. The King's route was lined with army and navy troops, both to express welcome and to prevent riots. Farmers across the country have prepared large-scale celebrations, and many more farmers have come to the capital to witness the King's restoration. (National Telegram on the 24th)</p>

Retired soldiers then submitted a letter to the King, asking him to forgive the past and govern the country according to law. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek cruiser "Hellas," carrying King George II of Greece, arrived off the coast of Corfu this afternoon. The people of Corfu hired many ships to greet the ship off the coast. As the "Hellas" and its escorting Greek destroyers "Hydra" and "Psara" approached the port of Corfu, residents climbed the ancient city walls on the island, shouting, waving the national flag, and singing royal songs, throwing flowers into the sea. At the same time, all churches in the city rang their bells and cannons were fired. The "Hellas" also fired cannons in return. King George II bowed to the crowd on the deck of the ship, with his brother Paul and Captain Sakellariou standing beside him. The weather was fine, making the public welcome even more enthusiastic. Lighthouses were set up on the small islands near Corfu and the Isagog Islands. When the "Hellas" passed by, the lighthouse keepers and their families all went to the shore to salute, and the "Hellas" fired cannons in return. This happened at every lighthouse and promontory.

<p>Tokyo Dispatch - The army and navy budget for 1936-37 may cause strife in the cabinet. Japan's current financial situation urgently requires strict austerity. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that regular expenses are 1,680,000,000 yuan and special expenses are 560,000,000 yuan. Recent developments in China have caused the Army Ministry to insist that new requests for 350,000,000 yuan in the next fiscal year are the absolute minimum. The Ministry of Finance insists that the special expenditures of both the Army and Navy Ministries must be reduced by 50%. The Navy Ministry is also insisting on new requests for 300,000,000 yuan, saying that international dangers may arise after the failure of the London Naval Conference, and preparations must be made early. The new requests from the Army and Navy Ministries total 650,000,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance has decided that the total amount of new requests from various ministries must not exceed 560,000,000 yuan, and 194,300,000 yuan of that has already been allocated to various ministries. The remaining 365,700,000 yuan is intended to reserve 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 yuan for emergency needs. Therefore, only about 325,700,000 yuan is left to meet the new requests from the Army and Navy Ministries, less than half of what is requested. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Breaking with the past practice of compiling the budget, the government fully conducted practical negotiations before the budget cabinet meeting in order to seek a solution to the problem. Therefore, the budget cabinet meeting, which was originally scheduled for the 22nd, was postponed to the 25th to allow the Ministry of Finance to continue negotiations with various ministries in the hope of avoiding disputes in the budget cabinet meeting. However, as a result of the negotiations on the 23rd, a final understanding has not yet been reached, centering on the national defense budget. Therefore, the budget cabinet meeting cannot be held on the 25th. Vice Minister of Finance Tsushima and the directors of various bureaus visited Finance Minister Takahashi at his private residence yesterday to report on the progress of the practical negotiations and to state that the budget cabinet meeting must be postponed to the 26th. He wanted to resolve the military budget practically on the 25th. Minister Takahashi expressed his approval. Vice Minister Tsushima and Director Kaya then visited Prime Minister Okada and Chief Secretary Shirane at their official residences to convey the intentions of the financial authorities and request understanding. Prime Minister Okada also acknowledged the postponement, as practical negotiations had already reached this point, and agreed to notify the cabinet members. As a result, the budget cabinet meeting was decided to be held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the 26th. As a result, the meeting of the heads of the Ministry of Finance on the 24th was postponed to the 25th, and all negotiations with various ministries must be completed on the 25th so that the original plan can be satisfactorily decided at the cabinet meeting on the 26th. However, in fact, the Ministry of Finance is not allowed to be optimistic, as it has fallen into a state of stagnation. The extent to which the policy of coordinating finances and establishing it has been concretized is particularly noteworthy. The situation of the stagnation of practical negotiations is roughly as follows: (1) The natural increase in revenue for the next year was initially estimated at 83 million yuan. Later, due to the increase in kerosene tariffs and the amendment of the Iron and Steel Industry Law, it is estimated that it can be increased by 10 million yuan, but even this amount cannot satisfy the revival requests of the military and other ministries. On one hand, the Ministry of Finance, which is placing the next year's budget policy on gradual debt reduction, has decided to acknowledge the limit of new requests above the first investigation, with no room for acknowledgement. (2) Regarding the budgets of the Army and Navy Ministries, the investigation can be said to be generous, acknowledging their entire plan and requesting concessions such as annual proportional unit prices. However, the two ministries only acknowledged 330 million yuan of new requests in the first investigation, which is not enough, and their attitude is quite strong. (Dentsu Telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Today, Mr. Vasconcelos, chairman of the Eighteen-Nation Committee, at the request of French Foreign Minister Laval, announced a postponement of the meeting. While Laval cited the French meeting on Thursday as the reason, this move is quite significant. Delaying the adoption of more severe sanctions against Italy by the League of Nations is, in fact, intended to facilitate diplomatic negotiations. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Eighteen-Nation Committee was originally scheduled to meet on the 29th of this month to decide whether to include items such as kerosene, coal, and iron on the list of embargoed goods against Italy. Now, due to the request from French Prime Minister Laval to postpone the meeting, the League of Nations Secretariat has issued a statement saying that the chairman of the Eighteen-Nation Committee, Vasconcelos, has changed the date of the meeting in accordance with Laval's request, and the date of the meeting will be decided on the 29th of this month. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Eighteen-Nation Committee was originally scheduled to meet this Friday. Following discussions between French Prime Minister Laval and British Ambassador Clerk, the meeting has been postponed. It is reported that the French government intends to temporarily avoid expanding the current measures prohibiting the shipment of essential goods to Italy, in order to allow the current sanctions time to take effect. The French government also wants to avoid any actions that could hinder the mediation efforts of the French Prime Minister. People here believe that the most effective sanction the League of Nations can impose on Italy is the cessation of gasoline supplies. It is widely believed that joint action on this matter can be established when the Eighteen-Nation Committee considers expanding the types of goods embargoed against Italy. It is hoped that American oil companies will agree not to increase their exports to Italy when the League of Nations implements a ban on gasoline supplies to Italy. However, there are still difficulties to be resolved. Some countries may argue for giving the current sanctions a longer trial period before adopting new sanctions. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the current embargo can be expanded before the new year. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government is reportedly quite satisfied with the decision to postpone the Eighteen-Nation Committee meeting. A government spokesman told a Reuters reporter today that this was the first sensible action taken by Geneva in a long time. However, Italy considers the ban on gasoline shipments to be a major threat. It is reported that the Italian Ambassador to France has notified the French Prime Minister that Italy will view the gasoline ban with grave concern.

<p>(Rome) Political figures here declare that negotiations on the Abyssinian issue will be facilitated when the London Naval Conference convenes next month. When the Italian representatives and experts attend the conference, they will thoroughly explain Italy's attitude, namely that Italy's naval policy and the closeness between Italy and France do not imply opposition to Britain. It is also said that Prime Minister Mussolini has been holding talks with British Ambassador to Italy Drummond in recent days, with both sides focusing on psychological aspects. The upcoming naval conference will surely bring things to a practical level. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Italy Drummond met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last Saturday. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, Drummond visited the Italian Prime Minister on instructions from his government. The transmission of these instructions was kept unusually secret. It is reported that the scope of Drummond's talks with the Italian Prime Minister was even broader than the recent series of Anglo-Italian talks. "Because Britain, if possible, will cooperate to restore peace on some fair basis, the purpose of this talk is to prepare in advance." (Havas Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Southern Abyssinian Army Launches Sudden Attack, Morale Boosted; Italian Army in the North Shows No Sign of Continued Offensive <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) The sudden attack by the Abyssinian army in southeastern Ogaden Province has changed the situation of the war in that area and attracted general attention. According to a Reuters correspondent stationed in the Abyssinian capital, Harar, the Abyssinian army is advancing rapidly along the Fafan River, recovering the land seized by Italian mechanized troops last week. The Abyssinian army had repeatedly suffered defeats, and morale was low, but since the Abyssinian Emperor encouraged the soldiers on the southern front, morale has greatly increased. According to a Reuters correspondent at the Italian army headquarters in Asmara, the Italian army in the north shows no sign of continuing its offensive. This is not only due to the change of commander-in-chief but also because it is urgently necessary to consolidate the captured positions and pacify the people. The Italian army is now holding a key-shaped line hundreds of miles long with 150,000 troops, starting from Sudan and reaching Addis Adassie, then bypassing Addis Filla, Bethlehem Mountain, Dantra, and Asbi. The telegram also stated that Mussolini's son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, received a silver medal for his meritorious service in the aerial attacks last week. According to a Reuters military correspondent in Mogadishu, the former Italian envoy to Abyssinia, Count Vinci, returned to Abyssinia from Italy to command a squadron of field artillery. General Bernardo, a well-known aviator, also arrived in Italian Somaliland and will serve as the commander of the Italian Air Force on the southern front. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa. Semi-official sources here today estimated that approximately 4,700 Italian troops have been killed by Abyssinian soldiers in the past two weeks, and this is only the death toll on the northern front. According to reports received here, the Abyssinian army has also captured over 1,000 rifles and 40 machine guns, greatly improving the armaments of the Abyssinian army, which lacks equipment. Officials stated that from now on, the Abyssinian army will resist step by step and will never give up an inch of land. Small groups of Abyssinian soldiers have apparently penetrated deep behind Italian lines, causing the Italian army to be exhausted. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. The news of the Abyssinian army's victory circulating everywhere cannot be confirmed today, as most of this news is based on reports from generals on the northern front. Fair observers believe that these generals are eager to show off their merits to the Abyssinian Emperor, so the reports are probably somewhat exaggerated. At the same time, a spokesman for the Army Ministry here stated that Abyssinia's preparations for resistance have matured, and future Italian advances will incur significant sacrifices. In recent days, people in general have paid more attention to the Italian equipment captured by the Abyssinian army than to the number of Italian casualties. It is also learned that the Abyssinian Emperor will soon go to Taishi in person to command the Abyssinian army and launch a counterattack against Italy. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The United States is still striving to prevent all wartime trade with belligerent nations. This move is tantamount to implementing unofficial sanctions against Italy, as the United States has no dealings with Abyssinia. Although officials here have repeatedly stated that the United States' neutral actions have no direct relationship with the League of Nations' sanctions and have strongly asserted that the United States' plans are not influenced by other governments or the League of Nations, in fact, various government departments are fully cooperating with the State Department to prevent the export of all war supplies. It is also learned that Secretary of State Hull has begun investigating the quantity of cotton exported to Italy after the arms embargo order was issued on October 5. If there is an abnormal increase, the government may implement a ban. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Officials here today are deeply concerned that the neutral actions taken by the U.S. government will hinder Italy's struggle against the League of Nations' sanctions. A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Italy's relations with the United States have always been "very friendly," but if the United States prohibits the shipment of kerosene to Italy, it will be regarded as a "hostile" action. If the prohibition is implemented, Italy will inevitably take corresponding countermeasures. At the same time, the general Italian people do not seem to be feeling the impact of the League of Nations' economic encirclement today. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Romanian oil companies have recently submitted a petition to the government, stating that for the sake of Romania's own interests, kerosene should be allowed to continue to be shipped to Italy. The price of goods can no longer be paid through remittance methods, but can be paid directly in lira, or other methods can be agreed upon with Italian import merchants. In 1935, the quantity of Romanian kerosene shipped to Italy totaled 1.5 million tons, accounting for a quarter of Romania's total kerosene exports. Now that the sanctions have been implemented, Italy can no longer use barter methods and will inevitably use cash to purchase kerosene from the United States. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's organ, the Political Economy Magazine, recently published an article on the impact of sanctions against Italy on international trade, stating that the world's economic structure will be completely shaken by the implementation of sanctions against Italy. For example, India, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa will be more affected by the sanctions than other countries, and they will inevitably seek other customers to compensate for the loss of their Italian markets. The longer the sanctions are implemented, the more difficult it will be for international trade to return to normal. As for Czechoslovakia and Estonia, a large part of their coal and kerosene production is sold to Italy. In addition, the production of manganese, ferromanganese, pig iron, and tin has always been entirely dependent on the countries currently participating in the sanctions. If trade is interrupted one day, the countries participating in the sanctions will inevitably seek other sales channels, and Italy will also seek supplies from other countries. If this is the case, whether the countries participating in the sanctions will be able to restore their old trade relations with Italy after the sanctions are lifted is questionable.

<p>(Tokyo) French representative Laval and British representative Hoare, taking advantage of the meeting of the Sanctions Adjustment Committee in Geneva a few days ago, repeatedly discussed reorganizing the League of Nations, requesting Germany, the United States, and Japan to rejoin, in order to reform the current state of the League of Nations. They plan to redistribute global colonies, establishing several groups of peaceful areas, each under mutual security guarantees, without aggression, in order to maintain the power of the alliance's powers for a long time. France's condition is to seek Britain's recognition of the meaning of the Locarno Treaty and to guarantee the borders of the Rhineland. Britain's condition is to require France to temporarily refrain from signing the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and to allow the annexation of Austria by Germany. The movement to reorganize the League of Nations is still underway in secret. (China United Press Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">US Far East Trade: Exports to Japan Exceed Those to China by Three Times; Commercial Concepts Tend to Adjust <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Currently, the United States' trade with Japan is more than three times that with China. Therefore, the United States' commercial concepts regarding the Far East also need to be adjusted. From a strictly financial point of view, transactions with Japan are far more profitable than those with China. However, the United States' commercial concepts have always maintained their friendly sympathy towards China, so the U.S. government is also unwilling to abandon its historically deep-rooted Far East policy. If the relationship between the United States and Japan continues to expand, it may be necessary to reconsider the United States' Far East economic policy. Formal statistics obtained by the Associated Press show that the trend in the U.S. economy has shifted sharply from China to Japan since the global recession. In the five years from 1926 to 1930, U.S. exports to Japan averaged US$245,036,000 per year. In 1932, it fell to US$134,921,000, and in 1934, it recovered to US$210,420,000. In the first eight months of this year, it was US$115,870,000. Exports to China averaged US$109,021,000 per year from 1926 to 1930. In 1933, it fell to US$51,942,000. The following year was slightly better, but it was only US$68,632,000. In the first eight months of this year, it was only US$26,659,000, which is less than a quarter of that of Japan. On the import side, Japan averaged US$379,632,000 per year before 1930. Subsequently, it fell to US$119,251,000 in 1934. In the first eight months of this year, it was US$94,339,000, indicating that the total for this year will improve again. China's early average was US$140,306,000. In 1932, it fell to US$26,177,000. Two years later, it recovered to US$43,933,000. In the first eight months of this year, it also reached US$41,690,000. Although the situation has improved significantly compared to last year, it is still less than half of that of Japan. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Since the Bank of France issued its weekly report last Tuesday, large amounts of gold have continued to flow out of the country. The bank has therefore raised the discount rate again today, from 5 percent to 6 percent, to remedy the situation. It is generally estimated that since November 14, more than 10 billion francs of gold have flowed out of the country. The government will officially announce this figure on Sunday. It is expected that the amount of gold and silver currency reserves listed in the Bank of France's weekly report will fall from 70 billion francs to 69 billion francs. When the government legally stabilized the franc on June 25, 1928, the Bank of France's gold reserves were only 29 billion francs. By the end of 1934, its total gold reserves reached 82 billion francs, the highest amount of gold reserves in history. The current level of gold reserves of 69 billion francs is similar to the number of reserves at the end of 1921. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

Attendees included: National Government Representative Li Shucheng, Executive Yuan Representative Jia Shiyi, Examination Yuan Representative Cheng Qibao, Judicial Yuan Representative Shi Yangan, Control Yuan Representative Wang Huai, Ministry of Interior Representative Meng Guangpeng, Ministry of Navy Representative Chen Wumin, Ministry of Communications Representative Gao Tingzi, Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Representative Xiao Yang, Central Relief Committee Representative He Hengfu, Hunan Provincial Government Representative Hu Kuihuai, Hubei Provincial Government Representative Lu Zhu, Ningxia Provincial Government Representative Tong Binqiu, Qingdao Municipal Government Representative Shen Zhaonian, Hu Zongduo’s Representative Yan Jing, Audit Department Representative Ren Yingzhong, Li Liejun’s Representative Ding Lizhong, Zhang Guogan’s Representative Zhang Chuancong, former Premier Li Genyuan, former Minister of Education Peng Yunyi, Sun Wu, a hero of the Wuchang Uprising, as well as various agencies, organizations, schools, relatives, subordinates, and the general public of this province, totaling over 50,000 people. All consuls stationed in Hankou from the countries of England, America, Italy, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and Denmark participated. The British and Japanese consuls were also representing the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Ministry, respectively. At 11:00 AM, a memorial service was first held at Hongshan Fajie Palace, with National Government Representative Li Shucheng as the chief celebrant, and Jia Shiyi, Cheng Qibao, Shi Yancheng, and Chen Jicheng as accompanying celebrants. After the presentation of flowers and the playing of music, the eulogy of Chairman Lin of the National Government was read. The original text reads: "On this 24th day of November in the 24th year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, hereby specially appoints Li Shucheng, member of the Hubei Provincial Government, to respectfully offer incense and pay tribute to the spirit of former President Li, saying: 'Alas, the righteous spirit of the universe, the heroic spirit of mountains and seas, has been gathering for decades, and heroes have emerged. The vast Jianghan, the record of the southern country. You, our lord, rose in response to the times. Storms and hardships, winds and clouds gathered. The banner of Han was raised, and hundreds of cities followed. You welcomed the enlightened pioneer, and did not seek great achievements. You guarded Jingxiang, and were looked up to from afar. The position of the nation was in crisis, and the founding was renewed. You held fast to virtue and accepted the mandate of heaven. Your virtue and capacity were consistent in danger and ease. You righted the wrongs and finally extended great righteousness. You again held the reins of power, with generosity and gentleness, regarding the people as wounded. Your benevolent grace flowed everywhere. The tripod ascended to the heavens, and you passed away eight years ago. People from home and abroad have returned to benevolence, and praises and thoughts have not ceased. Images are cast in bronze, and tears are left on the stele. You protected the people and supported the country, ascending and descending in this world, carrying on the cause of the Yellow Emperor, and your achievements hang down on the nation. We revere virtue and repay merit, and the ceremonies should be generous. The clouds of Chu are luxuriant, and the trees of Han are green. A fine tomb is laid, and the flesh is consumed without end. May you enjoy this sacrifice.’" After the sacrifice, a 19-gun salute was fired, and the coffin was moved down the mountain. The funeral procession consisted of eight rows: the first row was a six-member artillery unit of cavalry vanguard, with the party and national flags leading the way; the second row was the police band and a company of police infantry; the third row was the navy; the fourth row was the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau band and special police from the provincial capital Public Security Bureau; the fifth row was the Thirteenth Division band, representatives from party, government, military, and police agencies from various provinces and cities, representatives from various agencies and organizations within the province, and patrol infantry; the sixth row was representatives from central ministries and commissions and the heads of this province; the seventh row was the coffin, followed by the family; the eighth row was cavalry as the rearguard. The procession was three miles long, an unprecedented spectacle. In Wuchang, the weather had been clear and warm for the past two days, unlike winter. Today, it suddenly changed to severe cold, with bitter rain and a dismal wind, as if mourning for this founding hero. However, the pallbearers braved the rain, walking in an orderly manner, and the order remained extremely disciplined. Along the route, there were many roadside sacrifices, which showed that the love left behind remained in people's hearts. At 2:00 PM, the coffin arrived at the vegetable field in Zhuodaoquan. In front of the cemetery was Chairman Lin's inscription "Founding Hero of the Republic," below which was a portrait of President Li, flanked by elegiac couplets from various circles, with many excellent compositions. At 3:00 PM, the state funeral ceremony was held, with a 101-gun salute. Li Shucheng was still the chief celebrant, and representatives from all the central ministries and commissions and foreign guests were accompanying celebrants. After the ceremony, the coffin was respectfully placed in the tomb, and a great man of an era was finally laid to rest underground. After the burial, representatives from all circles and the public paid their highest respects. The state funeral was thus completed. On this day, the entire nation, following the order of the National Government, flew flags at half-mast to mourn for President Li and suspended entertainment. The honor after death was second only to that of President Sun. Attached is a brief biography of Li: Li's ancestral home was Huangpi, born in Hanyang in the Jiazi year of the Tongzhi reign [1864]. His father, Zhao Xiang, served as a guerrilla officer in the Beiyang training army, stationed in Beitang. In the Guiwei year of the Guangxu reign [1883], Li studied at the Tianjin Beiyang Naval Academy. After graduating, he served in the navy. In the Sino-Japanese War, he served as the engineer officer on the Guangjia warship. Transferred from Guangzhou to Weihai, the ship was made of wood and not suitable for combat. The captain bravely participated in the battle. When the ship was surrounded, the captain left on a small boat. Li refused to be captured by the enemy and jumped into the sea. He nearly drowned, but finally swam to Dalian. Of the twelve who went with him, only four survived. Li mourned the defeat of the Green Standard Army and knew that without thorough academic research and practical combat preparation, it would be impossible to resist the enemy and avenge the shame. When Zhang Wenxiang supervised the Nanyang and built new fortresses in Jiangnan, it was difficult to find suitable candidates. Hearing of Li's talent and military knowledge, he summoned him and was impressed by his ability. He then ordered him to supervise the construction of the fortresses on Jinling, Jiangyin, and Shilang Mountains, all of which were solid and moderate in size. He then accompanied the governor of Huguang and, together with a German, trained the Hubei New Army. He went to Japan three times to investigate military affairs, spending a year and a half in the East Ocean. He served as the commander of the Hubei Guard Cavalry, the commander of the Vanguard Battalion, the associate commander of the Second Brigade, and the commander of the brigade. He was also appointed commander of the 21st Mixed Brigade, concurrently managing the cavalry, artillery, engineering, and supply teams, and supervising the two arsenals for weapons and gunpowder, and supervising the Wuchang Middle School, co-organizing the Special Army School, and commanding six Chu-type warships and four Hu-type torpedo boats. In the Bingwu year [1906], at the military maneuvers in Zhangde, he served as the commander of the Hubei army. Li was diligent, honest, frugal, and strict and benevolent in governing the army. He not only used military tactics to control them but also encouraged them with great righteousness. Everyone submitted to him. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the government was corrupt and used petty people. Rui Cheng, the governor of Hubei, was particularly hasty and tried to harm Li. At the time of the Wuchang Uprising, it was launched in haste, and the entire city had no leader. The revolutionary army and the members of the Advisory Bureau unanimously elected Li as the Grand Governor of the Hubei Army Government of the Republic of China. Li declined modestly but could not refuse. He then made an agreement to prohibit wanton killing and temporarily maintained local security in the name of the military leader, with the aim of letting the entire nation resolve national affairs. After obtaining unanimous agreement, he took office. The whole province cheered, and the situation was stabilized. Li then calmly responded to changes, without showing any emotion. He occupied Hanyang and Xiaokou, deployed military forces to prepare for battle, and sent personnel to negotiate with the consuls of various countries stationed in Hankou, who unanimously recognized them as belligerent groups. As a result, various provinces responded one after another and sent representatives to elect Li as the Grand General of the Central Army and Navy. At that time, Huang Xing came to Hankou and proposed establishing a government. Li considered military affairs to be urgent and appointed Huang to be solely responsible for military affairs. Although Hanyang was lost, Nanjing was fortunately captured. After the armistice, representatives from various provinces gathered in Shanghai and elected President Sun and Li as the provisional president and vice president. The Nanjing government was established. President Sun ceded the presidency to Yuan Shikai, and the provisional senate again appointed Yuan and Li as the provisional president and vice president. At that time, the central authority was not yet stable, and the provinces were uneasy. Li overcame difficulties and looked forward to the hope of the world. Li saw that the power of the military governors was too great and feared that it would lead to the disaster of feudal lords, which would hinder national unity. Therefore, he advocated the separation of military and civilian affairs and took the lead in disbanding troops, setting an example for the world. Of the ten divisions of the Hubei army, seven were disbanded, and they were given funds to return to farming. He also ordered that civilian finances and administration be returned to the civil affairs chief, advocated judicial independence, and strictly prohibited opium, so that planting and transportation disappeared. The new policies at the beginning of the Republic were extremely prosperous for a time. In the second year of the Republic [1913], the Song case occurred, and Jiangxi declared independence, followed by Hunan. Li was promoting unification and using the Mediation Association. He was formally elected vice president and resigned from his position as military governor of Hubei to enter the capital. When the Preparatory Society for the Restoration of the Monarchy arose and the Hongxian regime was about to be established, Li resigned from his concurrent posts as Director of the Council of State and Chief of the General Staff, withdrew from Yingtai, and refused the false title of Prince Wuyi. People wore mourning clothes in protest. After Yuan's death, Li legally succeeded as president in June of the fifth year [1916], restored the Provisional Constitution, convened the National Assembly, and changed the presidential system to a cabinet system. The cabinet members were all leading figures from various parties and did not use a single private individual. When the participation in the war and the loan issues arose, there were disagreements between the presidential palace and the cabinet. The cabinet sought foreign aid to restrain the presidential palace, which led to the Xuzhou Conference. The military governors gathered in the capital and requested the dissolution of the National Assembly. Zhang Xun, advocating peace, entered Beijing, attempting to restore the monarchy. Li, unwilling to see the country fall apart, temporarily suspended the National Assembly to abolish the military governors' group's independence. When Zhang Xun restored the monarchy, Li reappointed Duan Qirui as the premier of the State Council and commander-in-chief of the expedition against the rebels. The remnants secretly ordered Li to go to Tianjin. The next day, he went to live in the Eastern Legation Quarter and sent the presidential seal to Duan, ordering him to hand it over to Vice President Feng. Then, he telegraphed his resignation. When the rebellion was suppressed, Duan, as the leader, earnestly requested Li to resume his post. Li resolutely refused and went to live in Tianjin. During the constitutional protection movement, the north and south confronted each other. Public opinion considered the restoration of the constitutional system as the key to resolving the situation. In the eleventh year [1922], the Beiyang generals invited Li to resume his post. Li refused firmly, so the abolition of military governors and the disbandment of troops were the main points of agreement, and the various frontier officials responded rashly. National legal organizations also unanimously urged him to proceed, so he entered the capital alone, rescinded the order issued in the sixth year [1917] under duress from the military governors' group and the leaders of the restoration to dissolve the National Assembly, so that the members of both houses of parliament resumed their posts. Li considered that the country's chaos was due to the lack of a constitution, so he urged the establishment of a constitution as a matter of great urgency, while those with ulterior motives, on the contrary, were plotting to consolidate their positions. Thereupon, they committed acts of insubordination and rebellion, forcing the presidential palace and the residence to be surrounded, and Li fled back to Tianjin. On the way, the bizarre drama of robbing the car and stealing the seal was staged, and from this, bribery elections were rampant, and the National Assembly went bankrupt. During his two terms as president, Li did not raise foreign debts or seek foreign aid, and none of his subordinates were personal soldiers, and none of his subordinates were private factions. He was not alarmed by great changes or afraid of great difficulties. After resigning, he lived in seclusion in Tianjin and died of illness on June 3 of the seventeenth year [1928]. On his deathbed, he still thought of national affairs. (24th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">After Li Zongren Returns to Guangxi, the Exchange Rate Between Silver and Paper Money is Determined, and Measures for Punishing Cash Transactions are Promulgated <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangxi Province promulgated currency management regulations, the Guangxi Provincial Government recently stipulated the exchange rate between silver dollars and Guangxi paper money to avoid disputes in the market. The exchange rates are set as follows: (1) One silver dollar is worth 1.20 Guangxi paper money; (2) One silver dollar is worth 1.44 Guangxi paper money; (3) One tael of pure silver (new衡市 scale) is worth 1.67 Guangxi paper money, and one tael (old scale) is worth 2 Guangxi paper money; (4) One tael of pure gold (new scale) is worth 150 Guangxi paper money, and one tael (old scale) is worth 180 Guangxi paper money. Since the prohibition of silver dollars in circulation, anyone found privately transporting silver dollars out of the province, in amounts of 20 yuan or less, will be allowed to exchange them for legal tender. Amounts exceeding 20 yuan will be confiscated. If cash is found, regardless of the amount, it will be confiscated and dealt with according to the law. Since silver dollars cannot circulate in the market, the demand for legal tender has increased sharply. The provincial government has telegraphed foreign countries to order the printing of legal tender and, at the same time, the Guangxi Bank will issue more subsidiary coins to provide relief. The issued subsidiary coins are divided into 1 jiao, 2.5 jiao, and 5 jiao denominations. Subsequently, market transactions and accounts will be based on legal tender. If transactions are still conducted in silver, they will be handled in accordance with the Measures for Punishing Cash Transactions. The punishment measures are divided into six items: (1) For all public and private payments and collections of debts, if the use of silver coins or raw gold and silver is discovered, in addition to confiscating the original items, both the payer and the receiver will be fined up to 1,000 yuan. However, for all contracts stipulated with silver coins as the standard before the promulgation of the currency management measures in this province, they should be paid with provincial banknotes on the due date according to the original amount; (2) In all parts of the province, except for areas where banknotes have not yet been circulated, if merchants or people are found to be trading or buying and selling with silver coins or raw gold and silver in the market, once discovered, in addition to confiscating the original items, they will be punished according to the previous article; (3) In areas of the province where banknotes are circulating or have not been circulated, if silver coins or raw gold and silver are carried or transported out of the province without government approval, once discovered, in addition to confiscating the original items, they will all be fined up to 500 yuan; (4) In areas of the province where banknotes are circulating or have not been circulated, if silver coins or raw gold and silver are carried or transported out of the provincial border without government approval, the punishment methods are as follows: (A) Those who hide them in other goods, hoping to deceive and smuggle them out of the province for personal gain, once discovered, in addition to confiscating the original items, will be punished by doubling the amount seized; (B) Those who completely transport large amounts of silver coins or raw gold and silver out of the province, intending to sabotage the financial system, once found to be true, will be sentenced to death in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China, and those who transport them on behalf of others will also be punished; (5) In areas of the province where banknotes are not circulating, if silver coins or raw gold and silver are carried or transported to areas where banknotes are circulating, when discovered, the bank will purchase them at the current price, and in addition to returning the original amount to the owner, the excess amount will be awarded as a reward; (6) Those who violate the currency management measures of this province, all merchants and people may report them, and 50% of the confiscated items and fines will be awarded to the whistleblower, 10% will be used as operating expenses for the executing agency, and the remaining 40% will be deposited into the treasury. The currency management situation in Guangxi Province is roughly the same as in Guangdong Province. As for the political aspect, Bai Chongxi recently telegraphed Li Zongren to return to Guangxi to discuss everything. Li then departed from Guangzhou on the 13th of this month with his wife Guo Dejie and bodyguards. On that day, he took the Guangzhou-Sanshui train to Sanshui, and then transferred to the Jiangning steamer in Hekou to go west. He arrived in Wuzhou on the 14th, rested in Wuzhou for one day, and took the Haizhu motorboat to Guixian on the 14th evening, and then transferred to Nanning.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Repeated Confiscations of Silver on the Ships Traveling Between Taiwan and Xiamen <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Over 5,000 Yuan Seized on the "Guangdong Maru," Over 2,000 Yuan Seized on the "Fengshan Maru"</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the government strictly prohibited the export of silver, there are still many smugglers. On the 20th of this month, the Japanese ship "Guangdong Maru" was about to leave Xiamen for Taiwan. Customs officers on the ship searched the passengers and found 500 silver dollars on a passenger named Pan Zaiwu. They also found silver bars worth over 5,000 yuan in the luggage of various passengers. They were all taken to the customs and transferred to the Central Bank for storage. A separate document was prepared to send Pan Zaiwu to the court for interrogation. Furthermore, some days ago, when the Japanese ship "Fengshan Maru" was about to depart, the customs officers found over 2,000 silver dollars in a rice jar in the crew's cabin. When the ship entered the port on the 12th, the customs negotiated with the shipowner, wanting to impose a penalty according to the customs regulations, because the silver was stored in a locked cabin, and the shipowner could not avoid a certain responsibility. After negotiation, the ship sent the cabin manager Zheng Peisen to the customs for processing. The ship's chief mate testified that Zheng was involved. After interrogation, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau for handling. The Japanese Consulate in Xiamen, at the request of the Xiamen Customs, posted a notice on the Japanese ships traveling between Taiwan and Xiamen, strictly prohibiting the smuggling of silver. Since then, the customs inspection has been strict and female inspectors have been hired specifically to search women's hidden items. Generally, smugglers use women to carry silver, but it is difficult to ensure foolproof. Therefore, they have changed their strategy, but female passengers still carry silver. Those who are caught are caught, and those who smuggle still smuggle. Those who are caught are few, and those who smuggle are many. It is said that the customs has slightly noticed this and will add more female inspectors to be more thorough and avoid corruption (November 23).</p>

<p>The members of the fire brigades in the first, second, third, and fourth districts of this county resigned in anger because Yao Chongfu and Li Duanzhi, members of the first district, were suddenly framed in the case of the fire at the former Songhui Amusement Park, and they returned their uniforms and hats to the fire brigade association to show their determination. As a result, the promotion of fire fighting was invisibly suspended, but the members still bravely rescued people at the fire scene, which was deeply appreciated by the local people. Magistrate Li, from the moment he took office, knew the enthusiasm of the fire brigade members in this county. He and the county party department sincerely persuaded the members to return to their posts in order to promote the soundness of the fire brigade during this winter fire prevention period. They urgently asked them to consider their obligations to their hometowns and restore the original situation. The members were very moved. Therefore, on the 25th, representatives from the County Public Security Bureau, the First District Office, and the County Chamber of Commerce sent the uniforms of the members of each district back to them. The president and vice president of the fire brigade association and all the members have accepted them. It is heard that the fire brigades are scheduled to establish a fire brigade on the first day to assist in winter fire prevention. The next day, the whole team will gather at the small training ground to check the machinery and equipment and reorganize them.</p>

<p>Yang Shijie, the captain of the detective team of the County Public Security Bureau, received a tip-off that the bandit gang that robbed the buses on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway was hiding in the house of Xia Xianggen, in the second Jia of the sixth Bao of Hutang Township, Caojing. He led the detectives to the site yesterday. However, the bandits had a lookout. After the bandits were notified, they fled through the back window. The detectives chased them in the dark, but the bandits removed the small wooden bridge, making it impossible to cross. When they arrived at Xia Xianggen's house, they entered the room and saw that the candles were still lit and the ground was covered with cigarette butts, proving that there was a gathering beforehand. They then found three silk-lined long gowns and a gold watch, which were lost by the bus passengers. They have already been taken back and presented to the case, and the escaped bandits are still being strictly hunted.</p>

<p>The Wu County Public Security Bureau has been making every effort to search for drug offenders. Recently, a person named Jia Deyu from Anhui was caught for privately manufacturing poison pills. Previously, he had been secretly manufacturing red pills in Changzhou on a relatively large scale, which was discovered by the Wujin County Public Security Bureau. The offender immediately fled without a trace, and was not captured. The Wu County Public Security Bureau received a tip-off, saying that the fugitive was hiding at the residence of a Mr. Wang at No. 2 Xiaochebian outside Banmen, Suzhou. They immediately ordered Inspector Cui of the Third Branch Station to lead police officers to arrest Jia Deyu, who was taken to the branch bureau. On the 25th, he was transferred to the Public Security Bureau to await consultation with the Wujin Public Security Bureau, who will dispatch police officers to Suzhou to escort him back to Changzhou to face investigation and trial.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Wuxi: Strike of Shops in Beiqifang Town <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Beiqifang Town, in the ninth district of the county, experienced a dispute on the afternoon of the previous day due to an investigation of smugglers bribing fugitives. As a result, all the shops in the town went on strike. After detailed investigation, the cause was found to be quite complex. It turns out that in August of this year, a boat carrying smuggled salt arrived in the town and was sold door-to-door. A local rogue named Hua Aliu, falsely using the name of a merchant team leader, extorted over a hundred yuan and allowed them to leave. Afterwards, the people of the town reported to the mountain anti-smuggling camp, which arrested Wang Baorong and Hua Yusheng, who were selling smuggled salt, and transferred them to the court for interrogation and detention. However, Hua Aliu was on the run and had not been apprehended. Recently, he returned to his hometown. The court received the news and dispatched bailiffs to the town to arrest him the day before yesterday. They first ordered Gao Sandu, the head of the village, to monitor him. Aliu then colluded with his elder brother Afive, luring Sandu to the Hua Yulin pharmacy. A group of ruffians, along with Alius mother and sister-in-law, surrounded and beat Gao Sandu, allowing Aliu to escape. Afterwards, they turned their anger on Gao Hongchou, the local bao head. Gao Hongchou, unwilling to show weakness, caused a disturbance for a long time. Gao Hongchou then closed the doors of his own Gao Litai cloth shop as a show of protest. Hua Afive and the group of ruffians had already coerced all the shops in the town to go on strike. The disturbance continued into the night and had not been resolved. The village head, Gao Sandu, went to the city yesterday morning to the court to have his injuries examined and to request the arrest and punishment of the perpetrators.

<h3 id="e73">Large-Scale Speculators Buying Silver Coins <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are legal tender and stopped the use of silver, speculators in various places have been buying silver dollars in the market. In recent days, speculators have been found in this county exchanging one yuan and one jiao in legal tender for one silver dollar from various small money changers. Some ignorant merchants, greedy for profit, are exchanging their silver coins one after another. It is reported that the purchased silver will be secretly sold to someone for a large profit. Now, silver coins in the market are worth as much as one yuan and three jiao in legal tender each. According to people in the financial industry, nearly ten thousand yuan in silver has flowed out of Wuxi County. However, there is not much silver in the market, so it is not easy for general speculators to buy it. At this time, when the whole country is uniformly implementing the new currency system, these speculators are exchanging large amounts of silver in the market, which is harmful to the Republic of China. It is hoped that the local authorities of this county will strictly investigate and prohibit it.</p>

After citizen Ling Kunsheng and others investigated and confirmed the facts, they filmed the evidence and submitted it to the Department of Finance, requesting the dispatch of personnel to investigate thoroughly. According to the report, the Department of Finance dispatched personnel secretly to the town yesterday to investigate the truth in conjunction with the town head Mao Liang and the bao heads Du Hesheng and Zhi Jiqing, and reported to the department for strict handling.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Truth about the Surrender of Abyssinian Chieftain Gugsa <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch</p>
<p>The Abyssinian chieftain Gugsa has surrendered to Italy, which may have significant consequences, as Gugsa is not only a commander in the Abyssinian army, but also the son-in-law of the emperor and the governor of the important eastern Tigre province. He is one of the two surviving leaders of the dynasty, and he and his cousin Seyoum, the governor of the western Tigre province, are both descendants of Emperor John, who was usurped by King Menelik of Shoa. In the past sixty years, the relationship between Shoa and Tigre has been very similar to the relationship between England and Scotland in the sixteenth century, while Italy has taken the position of France, supporting the Stuarts against England, with frequent battles and reconciliations. Reconciliations were mostly achieved through marriage, just as Henry VII married his daughter Margaret to James IV of Scotland. Menelik married his daughter Zewditu to the son of Emperor John, but unfortunately, this son died before inheriting the throne, so the alliance between the two dynasties never matured.</p>
<p>The current emperor attempted to complete the unfinished business of Menelik. His crown prince married the daughter of Seyoum, and he married his daughter to Gugsa, another leader of Tigre, hoping to permanently eliminate the discord between the north and the center through these two marriages. To what extent did he succeed? Since the violent coup in 1916, when the current emperor (Tafari) implicitly became the ruler of Abyssinia, the leaders of Tigre and the central government have often had disagreements, but have never openly rebelled, largely due to the emperor's intelligence. When he was regent, his first act was to restore the governorship of the Tigre province to the descendants of Emperor John, which was their rightful inheritance. However, he feared that the power of the leaders would be too great, endangering the throne. He divided the province into eastern and western parts, so Seyoum governed the western Tigre province, with Adwa as its capital, while his cousin, who was also his deeply hated rival, Gugsa Araya (whose son is now surrendering to the Italian army), became the leader of the eastern Tigre province, stationed in Magale. In the emperor's view, this approach had some effect, because what the emperor feared was that the two would unite and jointly restore the Tigre dynasty. Because they were jealous of each other and divided, they would not pursue this policy. Recently, there was an interesting story in Asmara that can give us a glimpse of their personalities. Because the emperor wanted to reconcile them, he specially ordered them to come to the capital for an audience. Thus, these two cousins had to travel together through Eritrea, where they boarded a ship to Djibouti, and then took a train to the capital. Each had a hundred armed warriors as guards, as well as wives, concubines, key staff, male and female servants, and slaves. The two teams first traveled by car to Asmara, where the Italian consul-general invited them to a banquet to promote unity. The two leaders initially refused to meet, but after repeated persuasion, they agreed to sit at the same table. During the meal, they did not acknowledge each other until near the end of the banquet, when they exchanged a few glasses of champagne and slowly softened. Finally, they shook hands and parted happily. However, this harmony was only superficial. If it had been genuine, Abyssinia's recent history would have been very different from what it is today. When Empress Zewditu abdicated and Tafari became regent, the country was divided into two factions, one supporting the empress and the other supporting the regent. The two cousins (Gugsa and Seyoum) naturally took different sides. As long as one sided with the empress, it would cause the other to conspire with the regent. Conversely, as long as one sided with the regent, it would be enough to cause the other to conspire with the empress.</p>
<p>Because the two were opposed to each other, the major turmoil that occurred at the end of 1929 was able to be overcome smoothly. At that time, the emperor's reform attempts led to a state of unrest, which was only resolved by his efforts to implement the treaty signed with Italy in 1928. The governors of the provinces complained, and the national laws and regulations were non-existent. The leader of the rebellion was Gugsa Wolie, the empress's ex-husband and the leader of central Amhara. The emperor first gave the rebels various opportunities to surrender with honor, but his advice and the empress's advice failed, so he decided to suppress them severely. He gathered the imperial army, commanded by General Mulushi, the Minister of the Army. He also ordered the leaders of the northern provinces to send troops to attack. Among the imperial army, only General Ayana won several battles. The northern provincial leaders all served the emperor and returned victorious, each carrying a large amount of spoils. Among them, Seyoum and Gugsa Araya contributed the most. General Ayana was skilled in strategy and had the help of a French aviator, defeating the rebels and killing their leader. He is currently resisting the Italian army in the north, and military experts consider him the most talented commander in Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Throughout the turmoil, the leaders all appeared to be loyal on the surface, but the attitude of the Tigre leaders, especially Gugsa Araya, was very untrustworthy. He was suspected of secretly inciting the turmoil, and was also despised because of his divorce. His ex-wife was the emperor's beloved niece. Later, he fell ill and died, and his son succeeded him. The emperor was greatly relieved, believing that the son would be easier to control than the father, so he married his daughter to him. Unexpectedly, this son has now surrendered to the Italian army, which shows that the emperor trusted the wrong person. In fact, Gugsa did not have much affection for his father-in-law, and the emperor did not trust him much either. Gugsa disregarded his young wife, allowing her to die of illness, and the emperor harbored resentment in his heart, which he could never forget. When the emperor heard the news that his beloved daughter was seriously ill in distant Tigre, he immediately sent a Greek imperial physician by plane to treat her, but it was too late. The plane later carried the princess's remains back to the capital for burial. This incident proves that the emperor was very dissatisfied with his son-in-law's coldness. Although the emperor still allowed Gugsa to serve as the governor of the eastern Tigre province, he was never at ease in his heart. Therefore, when he issued the general mobilization order, he did not give his son-in-law independent command, but ordered him to be under the control of General Seyoum. Seyoum was Gugsa's own and his father's strong enemy. Gugsa's rebellion and surrender to the Italian army this time was probably due to his resentment of the emperor's suspicion. However, the main motivation was probably to take this opportunity to destroy the Shoa dynasty. Furthermore, Gugsa may have believed that leaning towards Italy was the best way to advance his permanent interests, because if Tigre was under Italian protection, it would certainly need to establish a monarch as a puppet, and anyone who assisted the Italian army would obviously have priority. Whether other leaders will follow Gugsa's rebellion remains to be seen. If he is the only one, then it does not matter much, but if other leaders respond, then it is difficult to say.</p>

At noon, he hosted a banquet for the standing committee members of the Issuing Reserve Management Committee to discuss the committees regulations and other matters. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kong Summons Zhang Gongquan and Others</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at approximately 7:00 a.m. yesterday. He first returned to his residence to rest, then went to the Central Bank at approximately 11:00 a.m. to handle official business. He immediately summoned Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Kan, Central Bank Vice President Zhang Gongquan, Chen Xing, Business Bureau Director Xi Demao, Issuing Bureau Director Li Jue, and others to inquire about bank affairs. Subsequently, Bank of China Manager Bei Songsun, Bank of Communications Business Bureau Director Zhang Peishen, and others arrived in response to summons to visit Kong and discuss the stabilization of foreign exchange and financial stability. It is believed that these three are members of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee. They left at approximately 12:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Regulations and Procedures of the Reserve Committee</p>
<p>At noon, Kong hosted a banquet, inviting Issuing Reserve Management Committee members Xu Kan, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Li _, and Secretary Jin Guobao, among others.

<p>Another Report: Since its establishment, the Issuing Reserve Management Committee has found that the original offices of the Central Bank are insufficient due to the heavy workload. Therefore, new office space has been found on the fifth floor of No. 31 Jiujiang Road (directly connected to the Central Bank), and preparations have been actively made in recent days. The space has been completed and officially opened for business yesterday morning. All documents and files have been moved from the Central Bank to the new location. Committee members Song Ziwen and Zhang Gongquan, among others, personally took care of everything. It is said that the committee will inspect the reserve warehouses of each banknote-issuing bank at the end of this month in accordance with Article 7 of the committees regulations, and report the figures to the Ministry of Finance for record and public announcement to ensure credit. After the Ministry of Finance announced the regulations of the Issuing Reserve Management Committee on November 4, the Ministry of Finance originally had one representative, while other banks and the silver and money industry associations each had two to five representatives. In order to improve the system, Articles 1 and 3 of the regulations have been amended to increase the number of representatives from the Ministry of Finance to five. In addition to the original representative Xu Kan, four other people will be selected to fill the positions. The amended regulations were announced yesterday, and the amended articles are as follows: Article 1: The Ministry of Finance establishes the Issuing Reserve Management Committee to unify issuance and consolidate the credit of the legal tender.

The meeting was presided over by Chairman He Zhongxiao, recorded by Ge Huaiqing. (A) Report Items: (1) Minutes of the previous meeting; (2) Various reports on the preparation fund. (B) Discussion Items: (1) A letter from the Ministry of Communications stating that 200,000 yuan of the 24th year telecommunications government bonds would be used to borrow cash from the association. This was discussed at the eighth standing committee meeting of the third session. It was agreed that it would be difficult to completely refuse this loan. It is proposed to allow a loan of 100,000 yuan, which will be paid by the preparation fund. Is this feasible? Please make a public decision on this case. The resolution was passed. (2) The Ministry of Finance approved that each shop should successively submit the hard currency of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications after the fourth day, which will be used to offset 60% of the cash for bond redemption. It was decided at the 23rd standing committee meeting that all the 30,000 yuan in cash and ticket funds of the association previously stored in each shop will be used to offset 60% of the cash for bond redemption at the three banks. However, there is still a shortage of 40% in government bond preparation. It is resolved that each shop should prepare on its own and directly redeem from the three banks. It will be implemented after being submitted to the next representative standing committee meeting for decision. (3) It is proposed to design the style of bank drafts, checks, and remittances to comply with the laws and regulations on negotiable instruments. Please review the case. The resolution was passed.

<h3 id="e85">New Rice From the Four Rural Areas Floods In, Rice Prices Gradually Become Weak <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>A large amount of new rice from the four rural areas of Wuxi, Changshu, and others has flooded in, and the sales in the interior have become increasingly sluggish. Therefore, rice prices in this city have gradually become weak. Yesterday's selling price of No. 1 white japonica rice was 11.50 to 11 yuan, No. 2 rice was 11 yuan to 10.50 yuan, and other indica and glutinous rice varieties all retreated by 10 cents compared to the previous day. According to people in the rice industry, the listing of new rice would have originally caused a sharp drop in prices, but this year's market prices have remained stable due to the shortening of the exchange rate of legal tender.</p>

The severe cold is approaching, and they are pitifully hungry and cold. Moreover, after the floods in various provinces this year, the victims have come to Shanghai to find food. Most of them have no clothes and no food and urgently need relief. The cold shelter that the association has held in previous years should be established earlier. The Social Affairs Bureau has also sent a letter urging us to do so. However, we still hope that each charitable organization will make efforts to donate funds to prepare.

<p>Letter to Various Charitable Organizations That Have Not Acknowledged Donations</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, The association held a meeting on the 21st of this month to discuss the preparation of a temporary cold shelter. Each charitable organization has separately donated funds on record. However, the market is currently declining, and the number of unemployed people is increasing. The victims from various provinces have also come to Shanghai to find food. After the cold shelter is opened, the number of people it can accommodate will inevitably be even greater than in previous years. The funds needed are huge, and the funds donated by each charitable organization are far from sufficient. If your association can donate to provide relief, we deeply hope for it.</p>
<p>Letter to the Zhi Sheng Charity Hospital</p>
<p>Received the letter and 500 sets of cotton clothing and trousers, instructing us to distribute them to the disaster areas. We admire your benevolence and righteous deeds. However, we have found that many victims from various provinces have come to Shanghai to find food this year. The weather is gradually getting colder, and they are pitifully hungry and cold. After the temporary cold shelter is opened, they will inevitably ask to be accommodated. The cold shelter has no fixed funds and relies entirely on temporary fundraising. At this time, the market is declining, and it is very difficult to raise funds. All 500 sets of cotton clothing and trousers sent by your hospital are intended to be used by the cold shelter. The same is for relief, without distinction. Moreover, it is estimated that the cold shelter can accommodate a large number of victims from various provinces, which is also in line with the purpose of your hospital's disaster relief. I hope you agree. In addition to sending a receipt and publishing the titles of the donors in the newspaper to express our gratitude, we hereby inform you. We hope you will check it.</p>

We are sending it with this letter and asking you to forward it to the "Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces" for distribution to the disaster areas. Please give us a receipt. (Omitted below) Workers' Club of the Gongxian Arsenal, November 22nd</p>

<h3 id="e89">City Chamber of Commerce Resolves to End the Industrial and Commercial Revival Association, Unfinished Matters to Be Handled by the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously resolved at a members' meeting to establish the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee, and invited Consultant Wang Yansong to be the director, and hired experts to form groups for research. It successively published opinions on increasing chips, and two reports, "Guidelines for Handling Final Accounts" and "Guidelines for Industrial and Commercial Management". Now, because the government has reformed the currency system, the committee believes that the difficult chip problem has been largely resolved, and has voluntarily resolved to end the committee. The resolution was passed by the Standing Committee Meeting of the City Chamber of Commerce, and it will be ended at the end of this month. The unfinished matters will be handled by the Business Affairs Section for those concerning investigation, and by the Commercial Night School for those concerning research classes. At the same time, the organization of the original Business Affairs Committee will be expanded, and special committees will be set up to extend experts to join, in order to study and gather ideas at any time. The City Chamber of Commerce specially sent a letter to all members yesterday to express its gratitude. The letter said: Dear Sir/Madam, The association previously established the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee to save the market and seek industrial and commercial prosperity, and hired you as a member of the committee to participate in the design. Now, since the government has implemented currency management, the difficulties in raising funds for domestic industry and commerce have been largely resolved. The Revival Committee has resolved to end the committee's affairs, and the 69th Standing Committee Meeting has also approved it. The committee is scheduled to end at the end of this month, and the organization of the Business Affairs Committee of the association will be expanded in order to extend experts and gather ideas. We hereby record the case and express our gratitude. Please check it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, since being ordered to implement the stabilization of prices, has informed the industrial and commercial circles to report to the bureau the prices of various raw materials and various costs, so that the bureau can verify the prices. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the investigation work has been going smoothly since it began. Most of them have now reported to the bureau, and the bureau is examining whether the prices are too high. If there are excessive price increases, the bureau will resolutely order them to be stabilized to ensure the stability of the market. The price of food has previously experienced extreme fluctuations, but this matter is of great importance to the people's livelihood, so the bureau has paid special attention to it. After the bureau sent personnel to discuss with the grain merchants, the price of river rice has decreased, and other prices are also being effectively dealt with.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Fresh Pork Vending Association Asks the City Chamber of Commerce to Negotiate, Because the Ximen Branch Detains Goods and Detains People <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to reports from members Li Futai and Li Jinru, representatives of Shenzhuang, and others from the Fresh Pork Vending Association in this city, the piglets transported from other places to the South Railway Station and purchased from the shanty towns in Nanshi are often intercepted, detained, and arrested by the Ximen Branch along the way when they are rushed to the Xuejiabang Pig Market for sale. Recently, on the 22nd, the Ximen Branch detained Sun Jinyu overnight. The association appealed to the City Chamber of Commerce to negotiate on reasonable grounds, and the association was sincerely afraid that the same situation would occur again, which would lead to more disputes. For this reason, it sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to transfer to the Public Security Bureau to order all branch offices not to abuse their powers, detain goods, and detain people to maintain human rights. The letter said: Dear Sir/Madam, According to reports from members Li Futai and Li Jinru, representatives of Shenzhuang, and Tang Baoji and Tang Baoquan, representatives of Shenzhuang, and others, the members transported piglets from other places to the Nanshi Railway Station and purchased from the shanty towns in the Nanshi area, and rushed them to the Xuejiabang Pig Market for sale. Before the 20th year of the Republic of China, they used to obtain a permit from the Health Bureau, but it was later abolished and they were allowed to pass freely. However, the jurisdictions of the Ximen Branch still intercept them along the way, and they are not allowed to pass, detaining people and detaining goods, and abusing their powers. For example, on the 13th of this month, Sun Jinyu was entrusted to purchase 18 piglets from the shanty towns in Nanshi and sent them to the Xuejiabang Pig Market for sale on their behalf. When he passed the intersection of Xietu Road and Manufacturing Bureau Road, he was intercepted by the police in charge and detained at the Huixiao Road Police Station, and then released. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 22nd of this month, the Ximen Branch suddenly raised the old case again, detained Sun Jinyu overnight, and planned to fine him two yuan per pig, totaling 36 yuan. Fortunately, your association negotiated on reasonable grounds and was able to regain his freedom. If this continues, the members will suffer endlessly. Please find a way to provide relief, etc., to the association. It is found that the measures for transporting livestock and obtaining permits have long been revised by the Health Bureau. All healthy livestock transported within the directly administered districts of this city do not need to apply for permits and are allowed to be transported freely. However, those who start from the directly administered district and pass through the concession and are still in the directly administered district (such as from Nanshi to Zhabei) must apply for a special permit and submit it to the municipal government for approval. This was announced on November 20th of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Now, in the same directly administered area of Nanshi, when rushing piglets, the Ximen Branch first detained the goods, obstructing transportation, and then detained Sun Jinyu innocently overnight, hindering the freedom of merchants and violating the spirit of party governance and legislation. Approving the report, I am afraid that the same situation will happen again, so I am specially writing to your association, please transfer it to the Public Security Bureau to order the branch offices not to have the same situation again, in order to maintain the merit and show compassion to merchants. I am extremely grateful.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau's forced registration of smokers has been going on for more than 20 days since it started on the 1st of this month. After the bureau's efforts to investigate, publicize, and result, according to the bureau's statistics, a total of more than 200 opium offenders have been arrested, and more than 500 people who have awakened and surrendered themselves, totaling nearly 1,000 people. Propaganda is still being carried out, and in order to remedy the fact that the police may have some blind spots, causing some smokers who are still hiding and trying to avoid being caught to slip through the net, people are being rewarded for informing. Once verified, 30% of the fines will be awarded to the informant in accordance with regulations, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort in investigation. As for the matter of cracking down on opium dens, they are still being discovered recently, so the police are persuading landlords to pay attention when renting out houses to avoid being blamed.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Remarks by 何焯贤, Director of the Trademark Bureau, Following the Promulgation of the Revised Trademark Law by Government Order <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Following the National Government's promulgation of the revised Trademark Law on the 23rd of this month, inquiries were made to Mr. 何焯贤, Director of the Trademark Bureau, regarding the scope of the revisions and future work. Mr. 何 stated that he learned of the government order through newspapers, but as of now, the official document has not yet arrived. This case was resolved with revisions passed on October 31st at the 36th session of the Legislative Yuan. The scope of the revisions was disclosed in the 京中央日报 on October 31st, amending Articles 1, 3, 14, 27, 28, and 40 of the current law, and deleting Article 4. The key points of the revision are as follows: (1) The text used in trademarks, including pronunciation, is included. (2) When two or more persons apply separately for registration of identical or similar trademarks for the same product, registration shall be granted to the person who actually used it first within Chinese territory without interruption. (3) If an approved trademark is used after being altered or having additional marks added to imply something, the Trademark Bureau will, at its discretion or upon the request of an interested party, revoke it. The aforementioned scope of revisions was recorded by the 京中央日报 in its reporting. Whether the scope has been further revised will only be known in detail after the full text of the order arrives. As for the Trademark Bureau's recent work, it involves studying how to revise the Implementing Regulations of the Trademark Law. Because the law has been revised, the Implementing Regulations should also be promptly revised to facilitate the implementation of the new law. However, this must still wait until the full text of the order arrives, after which the proposed revisions to the Implementing Regulations can be submitted to the relevant ministry for adoption and promulgation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Recruitment Team Office of the China Aviation Association convened its 35th office affairs meeting the day before yesterday (the 23rd) to discuss all matters related to recruitment and fundraising. Attendees included officers 李大超, 张裕良, 张暇民, 陈硕, 朱声扬, 宋拯, 周松鹤, 顾尚瑞, 李际明, 饱冷雪, 杨倍闻, 魏建新, and 刘松涛. The meeting was chaired by 李大超, with 陈硕 as the recorder. The chairman's report briefly stated that the office had previously conducted fundraising for aviation to save the nation from various industries based on their income standards, with good results. The dance hall industry had been conducting trial fundraising since August 15th, and thanks to the assistance of various dance halls and the generosity of people from all walks of life, the results were excellent. However, the collection was previously handled directly by the office's assigned collectors. Now, for the sake of convenience, the method has been changed to entrust the dance halls to collect on behalf of the office. For every six or more tickets purchased at a dance hall, one dime will be collected per customer. For fewer than six tickets, five cents will be collected per customer, and the amount will be added to the bill. A quota of 100,000 yuan has been set, and after establishing the method, a letter has been sent to the Municipal Reserve for filing, and notices have been sent to various dance halls for implementation, which will be implemented soon. The Aviation to Save the Nation Mobile Simple Exhibition has been crowded with visitors since its opening at the 沪南 Public Education Hall on the 10th of this month. To increase audience interest and knowledge, efforts are being made to collect books and materials on air defense and aviation for display from various sources. As for the recruitment work of various recruitment teams, all field officers should strive to promote and assist in the process, prioritizing urgent matters and concluding them in stages. Individual recruitment of members from all walks of life will also be conducted. Furthermore, fundraising for aviation to save the nation from restaurants, public entertainment venues, cinemas, and the prostitution industry should be contacted and promoted. Efforts should be made to carry out these tasks. The report was followed by reports from field officers on the progress of contacting and inspecting the situation. The meeting then discussed the fundraising progress and adjourned at 4:35 PM. In addition, the office has continued to receive dues and donations of 314 yuan from 徐婉珊, the captain of the 246th team; 228.50 yuan from 周伯卿, the captain of the 406th team; 20 yuan in donations from 祭无忌, the captain of the 78th team; 26 yuan in dues from 陈能, the deputy captain of the 296th team; and 93 yuan in donations from 何藻, the deputy captain of the 84th team. The headquarters office has sent thank-you letters, urging them to continue their efforts and work together to accomplish the great undertaking.</p>

<p>This year's water disasters have been exceptionally severe, and victims everywhere are crying out for food. Now that winter has arrived, they are suffering from both hunger and cold, which is particularly tragic. This kind of relief work is truly urgent. The Fundraising Group of the Shanghai Relief Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces, feeling the urgency of relief, has discussed and decided on multiple fundraising plans, such as general donations for water disasters, fundraising by the Boy Scout mobilization, and various entertainment fundraising concerts held one after another. These have been implemented in succession. Fortunately, with the support of all sectors, each has been extremely effective. Although the market is currently depressed, people from all walks of life are still able to embrace the enthusiasm of helping those in need and generously donate, which is truly admirable. Mr. 王庆勋, the founder of the China Harmonica Society of North Sichuan Road, in view of the above, has consulted with the Water Disaster Relief Association and plans to hold a musical fundraising concert during the school's fifth anniversary, with all proceeds donated to relief efforts. It is reported that the plan is being discussed by Mr. 李大超, the deputy director of the fundraising group. The performance dates are set for 8:00 PM on the 30th of this month and 3:00 PM on the 1st of next month, for a total of two days. Each ticket costs one yuan.

<p>The National Medical Association, located at 南石皮弄 in 老西门, Shanghai, sent a letter yesterday to the 各省 Water Disaster Relief Association Fundraising Group on 雪南路, which reads: "To whom it may concern, our association members usually have a meal together after each meeting to socialize. Considering the severe water disasters in various places, which are truly pitiable, we have decided to cancel two meals and transfer the meal expenses to aid water disaster relief, totaling 48 yuan in national currency. Although it is a drop in the bucket, we are ashamed of its meagerness. We are merely expressing our sympathy. We hope you will accept it and transfer it for relief. We are truly grateful." This shows that regardless of who it is or what sector they are from, everyone has the heart to save those affected by the disaster, and even a bowl of porridge or a strand of thread can be used to assist in relief efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Railway Bureau Revises Sales Method for Regular Tickets; Cancels Original Four-Tiered Fare Reduction; Stipulates Sales Dates for Easier Inspection <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Based on the resolutions of the Ninth National Railway Transportation Conference, the Ministry of Railways ordered that Article 1 of the Regulations for the Issuance of Regular Train Tickets be revised to state that regular train tickets are sold by the Traffic Department of each Railway Bureau, and that sales methods be properly discussed. The Traffic Department of the Railway Bureau believes that the original method used by the railway has been in place for a long time and is no longer fully suitable for the current situation. Furthermore, the old method of dividing the fares into four tiers based on distance, with excessively large differences in the discount rates between each tier, often resulted in lower fares for longer distances than for shorter distances, which was also inappropriate. Moreover, sales at any time made inspection inconvenient, and there were doubts about whether passengers were using expired tickets fraudulently. In order to remedy the above shortcomings, the method has been revised as follows: (1) The original four-tiered fare reduction method has been canceled to ensure fairness, with higher fares for longer distances. (2) The discount rate method has been revised to charge the price of 40 one-way tickets for a one-month period, the price of 110 one-way tickets for a three-month period, the price of 190 one-way tickets for a six-month period, and the price of 340 one-way tickets for a twelve-month period. (3) The sales date is limited to the first day of each month. If sold after the first day, the validity period is also limited to the end of the month to prevent expired tickets from being used fraudulently. A monthly stamp will be added to the regular ticket to facilitate inspection by ticket inspectors and collectors. The above method has been approved by the Railway Bureau for trial implementation and has been reported to the Ministry of Railways for record.</p>

(2) Eliminate bandits. At this time of local famine and rural decline, some unscrupulous people may take the opportunity to rob. Village heads and neighborhood chiefs should also investigate and report them. If they conceal information, once a case is solved, all households in the neighborhood will be jointly responsible. (3) Work hard to promote literacy education. (4) Investigate and report changes in household registration. The details are omitted here.

<p>戴彰达, a farmer living in house number eight of the Dai family residence in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, made a living from farming and was fairly well-off. The night before last, around midnight, four or five robbers suddenly came, all speaking the local dialect and wearing short blue and green cloth shirts and trousers. They jumped into the house through the window. One robber brandished a sharp pointed knife, threatening the victims not to make a sound. They then began to ransack the house, overturning chests and cabinets. A total of more than ten yuan in foreign banknotes were stolen, but the clothes were left behind. Later, seeing that Dai's wife was wearing a pair of gold earrings, they forced her to take them off. Dai refused and argued with the robbers, causing him to be injured in the waist and back.

<p>At the Dafeng Cotton Mill in 潭子口, Zhabei, on the Suzhou Creek, two gangs of workers from Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) and Hubei (a province) clashed with each other over business yesterday morning around 11 o'clock at the mill gate. The Jiangbei gang gathered over a hundred people, with a larger presence, while the Hubei gang had only a few people. As a result of the brawl, the Hubei gang was outnumbered, and five people, including 余江生, 徐华五, 吴黄高, and 吴耀银, jumped into the Suzhou Creek to swim away. 徐华五, 吴黄高, and 吴耀银 managed to climb onto a boat and escape. 余江生 swam to the opposite bank and was taken to the 普陀路 police station by a Chinese detective from the British Concession, number 1159, for questioning. 胡忠元 drowned and his body sank to the bottom of the river.

<h3 id="e109">Major Drug Case Cracked at South Railway Station; Public Security Bureau Takes Custody of Ye Zicai; Ye Firmly Denies Smuggling Drugs and Is Willing to Face Extreme Punishment; Special Second Court Rules to Temporarily Not Transfer Him and Continue the Investigation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>At around 5:00 PM on the 23rd, 王长根, a native of Jianqiao, Hangzhou, transported six white cloth flour sacks filled with goods by handcart to the cargo depot at the rear gate of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway South Station in the Nanshi district, entrusting the Xie Daxing Transport Company there to transport them to Lanxi, Zhejiang. Because the company asked Wang for a letter of authorization from the consignor and inquired about the name and quantity of the goods inside, Wang only stated that the sacks contained medicinal materials and could not answer any other questions, which aroused suspicion. The company sent an employee to accompany Wang back to retrieve the letter. Wang tried to escape halfway, but the employee apprehended him and handed him over to the patrol police, who took him to the Ximen Public Security Branch. The branch sent a detective to take Wang to the South Station, where the Xie Daxing Transport Company reported the incident to the South Station Police Section. The inspector opened the sacks for inspection and discovered that they contained raw materials for the manufacture of red pills, such as heroin and morphine, worth more than 100,000 yuan. A related person, 胡世木, was subsequently apprehended at the rear gate of the station. According to Hu, he was instructed by 台州 native 叶子才, who lived at No. 21, Ren Shou Lane, Wang Zhi Road in the French Concession, to instruct 王长根 to transport the goods to the station for loading. The Ximen Public Security Branch's Detective Division Chief, 沈交达, dispatched detectives to accompany 王 and 胡 to the French Concession police station to request the dispatch of detectives to Ye Zicai's residence to arrest him. Ye was taken back to the police station for detention and further investigation. This has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the French Concession police handed over 叶子才 to the Criminal Division One of the Special Second Court. Judge 熊汇苹 questioned him. Lawyer 姚肇第 of the Police Department stated the case, saying that the Police Department, according to the Public Security Bureau's report that the defendant was involved in drug trafficking, arrested the defendant. Since the Police Department still needs to conduct a detailed investigation, please postpone the hearing. Shanghai Public Security Bureau commissioned legal counsel 詹纪凤 and detectives to arrive at the court. Lawyer Zhan stated the process of uncovering the drugs to the court and requested permission to transfer the defendant to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The defendant 叶子才 denied handing the drugs over to 胡 and 王, claiming that it was a malicious accusation and requested the court to conduct a detailed investigation. If it is verified, he is willing to accept extreme punishment. He also hired lawyer 葛之覃 to defend him, stating that the defendant is the owner of the Jinghua Woolen Mill and is a legitimate businessman. He submitted nine books of the Jinghua Mill's accounts as evidence. Next, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, lawyer Zhan, stated that the Public Security Bureau is now bringing 王长根 and 胡世木 to the court and requested to question them. The court ordered the two witnesses, 王 and 胡, to be brought to the court. First, Wang Changgen testified that he lived in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, and came to Shanghai on the 21st due to a disagreement with his parents. He went to the home of his relative 胡世木. On the morning of the 23rd, around 11:00 AM, a friend of Hu Shimu sent six sacks to Hu's place and entrusted Hu to send them to the station. Because Hu had to go out to do business, he asked me to transport them instead. At the transportation company, Hu said that the friend said that the items were contraband, but the friend said it was okay, so I transported them on his behalf. I don't know the name of Hu's friend, but I would recognize him if I saw him. The officer then pointed to the defendant and asked Wang if this was the person. Wang looked back at the defendant's face and replied yes, this is the person. Ye, hearing Wang's testimony, said to Wang, "You have to speak with your conscience." Then, 胡世木 arrived at the court and testified that he lived on Rue du Père Huc and usually sold small pieces of cloth. Wang Changgen is a relative of his. His cousin married Wang. On the morning of the 23rd, around 11:00 AM, Ye sent the sacks to my house and entrusted me to send them to the transportation company. Because I had to go out to do business and didn't have time, I asked Wang to transport them instead. The officer asked Hu, "How did Ye transport the sacks to your house?" Hu replied, "I was upstairs at the time and didn't see how Ye transported them, but he came upstairs alone, and that's when I knew." The defendant 叶子方 then testified that he went to the shipping company on the afternoon of the 23rd and went to the home of his friend 滕仲高 at No. 35, Xihu Lane, Ximen Road, at 11:00 AM, requesting an investigation. At this point, the officer said that the Police Department still needs to investigate the evidence in this case. The defendant will be detained temporarily, and he cannot be transferred today. The hearing will be continued at 2:00 PM on the 29th. The defendant was taken back into custody, and 王长根 and 胡世木 were taken back by the officials from the Public Security Bureau.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Mr. 江世澄, director of the Health Bureau's Second Division.

<p>The Anti-Crime Squad of the Municipal Police Bureau's New Zha Branch Bureau, led by Deputy Squad Leader Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan, received a confidential tip from an informant named Jin Kang around 2:00 AM the day before yesterday (Friday), indicating that a gang of thieves was hiding in Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road, and other locations. The Squad Leader immediately reported to Branch Bureau Chief Liao, who dispatched patrol officers Wu Dichen and Chi Baoren, along with Anti-Crime Squad Deputy Foreman Li Guiqing, to apprehend eleven suspected thieves. This was previously reported in the newspaper. It has since been learned that a female suspect, Zhu Shenshi, was apprehended that very night, and the following day a person named Yu Jin, suspected of buying stolen goods, was also brought in for questioning, bringing the total to thirteen. Their testimonies are as follows:</p>
<p>Ding Yaozhang testified: 32 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at No. 30, Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road. A few nights ago, Chou San gave me a pistol. I handed it over to Pan Er, who, along with Wang Xiaoliuzi, Li Baolong, and Pan Er Xiaokai, went to Panjiawan to rob people. They stole fur coats, overcoats, cotton robes, and other items, which Chou San later pawned. The robbery was Chou San's idea. I received two yuan as my share. About three or four months ago, five or six people robbed a household on the boundary road in Hongkou, attacking a rickshaw puller. I received 2,000 copper coins as my share. The confiscated pistol was entrusted to me by Chou San to keep, in preparation for future crimes.</p>
<p>Dai Baolong testified: 30 years old, from Funing, residing in a shack on Qimei Road, Hongkou. This month, along with Wang Xiaoliuzi, Ding Yaozhang, and others, I robbed the Panjiawan area, obtaining similar loot. I received two yuan as my share. We also robbed a place on the boundary road in Hongkou, receiving 2,000 copper coins, and robbed a houseboat on Qimei Road, Hongkou, receiving two or three yuan. We were also planning to rob a rice shop in Zhoujia Lane, Hongkou, and a place on Changan Road, as well as rob an old man of the banknotes in his cloth bag, but these attempts were unsuccessful. (The Anti-Crime Squad investigated and summoned the old man, Jin Rongkang, who testified that he was carrying banknotes worth tens of thousands of yuan in his cloth bag and was taking them to the New Zha branch of the Bank of China when several bandits attempted to rob him near Da Wang Temple, but failed.)</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoliuzi testified: 42 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 21, Sande Lane, Tanziwan. I previously worked at a cloth factory behind the nunnery north of the railway, where I committed a crime, obtaining twenty-one bolts of cloth and other items such as electric fans, which I sold through a person named Wang Songlin. On the 14th of this month, along with Ding Yaozhang, Dai Baolong, Chou San, Pan San Xiaokai, Pan Er, and others, I robbed Panjiawan, receiving two yuan as my share. We were planning to rob other places in Hongkou, but were unsuccessful. The pistol found on me belongs to Pan San Xiaokai.</p>
<p>Zhang Lianghe testified: 27 years old, from Funing, residing at Jingyuan Tou, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi. I previously served eight years in prison in the French Concession, so I changed my name to Jiang Dehe. I was released from prison in June of this year. Chou San, Dai Baolong, Xiao Erzi (i.e., Zhang Xiaoliuzi) and others asked me to rob a place near the Bao Weituan (i.e., Panjiawan). At that time, Dai Baolong gave me a pistol.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosi testified: 22-23 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a shack by the railway on Zhaozhou Road, Nanshi. I previously committed a crime and served eight months in the Shanghai Local Court. I was released on the 6th of this month. While in prison, I met Zhang Xiaoliuzi, so I came to look for him. The stolen goods from the crimes he committed came from the Hugunying, Guohuo Road, and other places. I have never been to Zhabei. Because they arrested him, they also arrested me.</p>
<p>Hong Dengyun testified: 19 years old, from Yancheng, residing at the Huayang Bathhouse, Hengfeng Road. I came to Shanghai from Zhangshan Bridge in the countryside because Zhang Xiaoliuzi's older brother asked me to deliver a letter to him, telling him to go back to work. I stayed overnight at his house that night and was unexpectedly arrested along with him.</p>
<p>Du Longxing testified: 24 years old, from Funing, residing in a shack in Panjiawan. I work at the Public Works Bureau. Wang Xiaoliuzi is my neighbor, and he knows that I have been in trouble with the law. He suspects that I inform on him, so he bears a grudge and accused me of being an accomplice.</p>
<p>Lushangzhong testified: 30 years old, from Han Ning, residing in Huazibang, making a living by pulling a rickshaw. Du Longxing accused me of informing on him, so I was arrested along with him.</p>
<p>Li San testified: 33 years old, from Funing, residing in a shack on Changsheng Road, Changan Road. Dai Baolong is my neighbor, but I have no connection with him. I know nothing about the things he does.</p>
<p>Peng Dazhang testified: 25 years old, from Funing, residing in a shack in Tong'an Lane, Changan Road. I make a living by selling paper. Li Desan lives with me, but I don't know what he does.</p>
<p>Chen Dekuan testified: 34 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a shack in Dapu Bridge. I sell beef at Dapu Bridge and know Xie Laoer, the backstage boss of the Ping'an Theater. He and Wang Youshan said they wanted to manage the theater and, if successful, would hire me as a staff member. Therefore, I am temporarily staying at a friend's house in Le'an Lane. I know someone surnamed Dai, but I don't know what they do.</p>
<p>Zhu Shenshi testified (i.e., Zhi Sunshi): 42 years old, from Huaicheng, residing at No. 14, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. My husband's name was Zhi San, and he is deceased. I previously served time in the French Concession. Four or five days ago, Dai Baolong and Pan Er Xiaokai came to my house. They brought a pistol and asked me to keep it safe. Later, they asked me to take it away. They are all friends of my husband, so I know them.</p>
<p>Wang Songlin testified: 35 years old, from Haimen, residing in a shack at the Huzhou Guild Hall, Huiwen Road. I used to work with Wang Xiaoliuzi in the same factory and know him. In September, he asked me to sell Patriotic Twill on his behalf. I don't know where it came from.</p>
<p>Yu Jin testified: 25 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 19, Mujia Bridge. On September 14th, someone from Xiao Chongming came to sell cloth and asked if I wanted it. Because he was a worker in the factory, I bought ten bolts of Patriotic Blue Cloth for five yuan and four jiao per bolt, and seven bolts of White Twill for three yuan and three jiao per bolt, totaling eighty-four yuan and three jiao. I paid the money in full and don't know where it came from.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Setting Up a False Business to Defraud in Silk Scarf Case, Masterminds All Fled Without a Trace, Person of Interest Zhou Yimei Arrested <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Ankang Silk and Satin Shop, located at No. 366 Hankou Road, recently received an order for sixty dozen silk scarves, valued at ninety-six yuan, from Yuchanglong, located at No. 10, Xinkang Lane, Wuchang Road. After Ankang delivered the goods, Yuchanglong paid with a check from Yusheng Qianzhuang, located at No. 40, Renmei Lane, Ningbo Road, dated the 18th of this month. On the 20th of this month, Yuchanglong and Yusheng Qianzhuang simultaneously declared bankruptcy. Ankang reported this to the General Inspectorate. Chinese Detectives Li Wenhan and Liu Qingsheng investigated and determined that Yuchanglong and Yusheng Qianzhuang had jointly set up a false business to defraud for profit. However, the persons in charge had all fled without a trace, making arrest impossible. Subsequently, it was discovered that Zhou Yimei, from Ningbo, had a significant connection with Yusheng. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 11:30 PM, Zhou was apprehended in Room 15 of the Pingqiao Hotel on Xizang Road. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Inspectorate's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the facts, stating that due to the urgency of the matter, an investigation had not yet been completed and requesting permission to detain him. He also stated that the defendant had been sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined 300 yuan by the First Special District Court in March of last year for fraud. He then presented the fingerprint record as evidence. Questioned, Zhou Yimei claimed that he had no relationship with Yusheng. However, the wooden furniture rented by Yuhe, which was located in the same place as Yusheng, was rented on my behalf, so I went there several times because of this. I knew nothing about the fraud. Witness Zhu Ronggen testified that he worked as a senior clerk in Yusheng Qianzhuang. The defendant and Fang and others came often and told me that if anything happened to Yusheng, they could blame it on the people from Yuhe and be safe. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendant Zhou Yimei to be detained.</p>

<p>Chen Guorui and others from this county previously opened the Yuxingyong Foreign Goods Store at No. 10, Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road. Gu Bingrui (also known as Gu Guangrong) and others from Jiangyin opened the Shunchang Store at No. 30, Pentang Lane, Shanxi Road, specializing in defrauding various merchants of goods with bad checks, selling them for profit and spending the money. Recently, they both declared bankruptcy, leading Yongfengchang Store on Liyuan Road, Nanshi, which had been defrauded, to report the case to the Old Zha Police Station. Yongfengchang was defrauded of fifty-four sets of mahjong tiles and one hundred and one sets of dominoes, totaling three hundred and one yuan. Chinese Detective Chief Zhang Yuanjing, Detectives Li Shugui, Wu Qilan, and Xue Youwen, among others, investigated and determined that Li Yongnian, a broker from Nanjing for Yongfengchang, was also suspected of being an accomplice. He was first detained. Then, Chen Guorui was arrested at No. 48, Changxing Lane, Maohai Road, and a licensed pistol and bullets, a Yuxingyong sign, seals, pawn tickets, and other items were seized. Subsequently, Lou Jirong and Bao Futong, both from Ningbo, were apprehended in Room 20 of the Wuzhou Hotel. Chinese Detective Huang Fusen from the Chengdu Road Police Station also arrested Gu Bingrui at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Avenue Edward VII. Xue Shixiong (also known as Fu Quan Shan Ye) from Jiangyin was apprehended at No. 26, Lane 343, Huade Road. Furthermore, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Xu Wangqing (Wen Ming Xi Gui) from Jiangyin at No. 5, Sanda Lane, Daji Road. All the apprehended criminals had significant connections with Yuxingyong and Shunchang, and Yuxingyong and Shunchang also had interconnected relationships. Therefore, the District Chief of District A ordered that the case be handled by the Old Zha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were jointly brought to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Inspectorate's lawyer, Gan Yaotang, requested detention in accordance with Articles 101 and 76 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The seized stolen goods and evidence would be presented during the formal indictment. In addition to Yongfengchang, other victims included those defrauded of 274 yuan worth of Amannia medicines, 170.2 yuan worth of socks, and 224 yuan worth of leather goods.

<h3 id="e115">Further Trial of Ancient Vase Case, Cheng Linsheng Surrendered Himself Yesterday, Content of Mortgage Dispute Complex <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Chi Yunfei, from Fujian, accused Jiang Yuting, the owner of Yuanzhang Jewelry Store at No. 99, Shanxi Road, from Wuxi, in the First Special District Court of defrauding him of an ancient Yuexuan vase worth tens of thousands of yuan. The court has repeatedly heard the case, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao held another hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court, and witnesses Yang Jingbing and Cheng Linsheng both appeared in court. Yang testified first, stating that on a certain day in August, because his wife was ill, he went to the home of his relative, Ye Chengming. Chi Yunfei happened to be there and said that the ancient vase had been defrauded by Jiang Yuting and that he planned to sue. Because both parties were friends, I acted as a mediator. I went with Chi to Jiang's place, and Jiang said that he had obtained the vase with great difficulty, so how could he easily let it go? He would only return the vase to Chi if I assumed responsibility for 6,000 yuan, because Cheng Linsheng owed him money. After three mediation attempts, we could not reach a resolution. Then, Cheng Linsheng testified that after mortgaging the vase to Yang Run Shen last year, it was transferred to Chi. In August, Jiang Yuting came and said that the daughter of a Tai Pan from an English-American Tobacco Company wanted to buy the vase, so I informed Chi Yunfei and asked him to bring the vase. Jiang said that he needed to take it for a day or two and would return it. Chi did not trust him, but because I had frequent transactions with Jiang, I did not suspect anything and issued a guarantee on his behalf. Chi then handed the vase to Jiang. Who knew it was a deception? The court then asked, according to the defendant's testimony, did you mortgage two diamond rings and this vase to him for a debt of 18,000 yuan? Cheng replied that there was no such thing. When Jiang took the two rings, he also said that someone wanted to buy them. I did not know that it was a deceitful trick. I also intend to accuse Jiang. The defendant claimed that Cheng had mortgaged the vase to him and that the vase had been given to him once in April. He asked that Pan Mingxun, a comprador from the Public Works Department, be summoned as a witness. The court ordered that the hearing be postponed for one week.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Brutal and Ferocious, Horrifying to Hear, A Tragic Incident of a Mother Beating Her Own Daughter to Death, The Girl's Urine and Feces Stained Her Clothes and She Was Often Severely Beaten, Recently She Was Severely Injured and Died From Being Struck With Firewood <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Ahzhong from Wuxi is employed as a gatekeeper at the No. 5 Shenxin Cotton Mill. His wife, Wang, is 22 years old and has given birth to two daughters. The elder daughter, Rongdi, who is only three years old, is fostered in their hometown. The younger daughter is still in swaddling clothes and is personally cared for by Wang. On the 27th of last month, Jiang moved to the three-story attic of Yang Mao's house at No. 36, Jifu Lane, Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu. On the 5th of this month, his elder daughter Rongdi, who was being fostered in Wuxi, was also sent back. The girl was naturally prone to crying and had only just begun to babble. She could not control her urination and defecation. Her mother, Wang,</p>
<p>was very violent, and did not know how to guide children. Whenever she saw the child crying, she would beat her. If she encountered urine and feces staining the child's clothes, she would roar incessantly and severely scold her. She was especially cruel to Rongdi and had no "慈母慈母(cimǔ)" attitude at all. Although the ignorant child was repeatedly severely beaten, she still urinated and defecated, and cried even more. Yang Mao, the second landlord, could not bear to watch. At first, she thought that Wang was young and unskilled in raising children, so she gave her special guidance. Unexpectedly, Wang not only ignored her, but also</p>
<p>went from bad to worse. She regarded Rongdi as a horse or cow. To avoid being implicated in the future, she issued an eviction order, asking Jiang to move. Jiang, however, was reluctant to leave, so he still lived there. Unexpectedly, Wang's treatment of Rongdi became even more vicious. The day before yesterday, the girl happened to defecate in her pants again. Wang then took a piece of firewood and violently struck her head, creating a hole, and blood flowed straight out. She not only did not feel any pity, but also took off the pants that the child was wearing, which were stained with feces, and covered the child's head and face with them.</p>
<p>She also used rope</p>
<p>to tightly tie one part of the pants around the child's neck. In addition, the child's hands and feet were all tied with rope. The child's weak life was subjected to this severe torment, so there was no hope of survival. Therefore, before the end of the day, the child was tortured to death. After the child died, Wang showed no grief. She wrapped the body in a large sheet and placed it in the bedroom, intending to find an opportunity to dispose of it. Later, Yang Mao was hanging clothes on the terrace and passed by the door of the room. She saw a bundle in the room and became suspicious. Upon inspection, the matter was revealed. In a short time, the news spread throughout the neighborhood, and the neighbors were all outraged by the woman's</p>
<p>cruel and vicious nature. Although the victim was her own daughter, the case involved a human life and could not be concealed. While people were discussing this, the Yulin Road Police Station, acting on a confidential report, sent Detective Huang Yufu to the scene to investigate together with a foreign detective. Yang Mao and others described the incident in detail. At this time, the woman was still trying to escape, but was arrested. The child's body was taken to the morgue on Fellen Road for examination. Yesterday morning, the case was reported to the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special District Local Court. Prosecutor Guo Wei, accompanied by two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue and confirmed that the girl, Jiang Rongdi,</p>
<p>was covered in injuries, with the injuries to the head and buttocks being the most severe. It was determined that she had died from serious injuries caused by being beaten while alive. Under questioning of Jiang Wang and various witnesses, the court determined that Jiang Wang was suspected of committing a crime and ordered her temporary detention. The Police Station was instructed to prosecute and await trial by the court. The child's body was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Medicine Research Institute for dissection at the request of the forensic doctor for medical research. Prosecutor Guo approved this and instructed the institute to hand over the body to Pushan Villa for burial after the dissection. This kind of tragic incident of a mother beating her own children to death is rare in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yisheng Silk and Satin Foreign Goods Store Stole Hundreds of Thousands in National Taxes, Sea Customs Anti-Smuggling Section Dispatched Personnel to Investigate and Crack the Case, Still a Large Amount of Untaxed Goods Being Sought <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yisheng Silk and Satin Foreign Goods Store, located at No. 54, Jixian Lane, Nanjing Road, was founded by Liu Mingjia, a wealthy merchant from Huzhou. It has been in business for over ten years. Liu initially started by dealing in piece goods of silk and wool fabrics. Most of the Western silk and wool fabrics sold by major silk and satin stores in Shanghai were retailed from Yisheng, allowing Liu to sit back and reap the profits. In less than ten years, he became a wealthy man. Recently, the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Jianghai Customs suddenly received a confidential report stating that most of the goods imported by Yisheng over the years had been smuggled, or that the quantity had been underreported. Over the past ten years, the amount of unpaid taxes was considerable. Upon receiving the report, the section, recognizing the seriousness of the case, secretly instructed its officers to exert several weeks of effort. They confirmed that the store had indeed committed the aforementioned acts. Yesterday, they urgently applied to the First Special District Court for a search warrant and, together with detectives from the Central Police Station, rushed to the store at No. 54, Jixian Lane, Nanjing Road at 3:30 PM to search it. The search lasted for two hours. As a result, all the accounts and a large amount of unsold untaxed goods, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, were seized. In addition to sealing up the goods, the accounts and other items were immediately taken away, and several key personnel from the store were detained and temporarily held at the Police Station, awaiting transfer to the court for questioning. It is reported that the Anti-Smuggling Section is particularly concerned about a recent large-scale import of untaxed goods, especially silk and wool piece goods, which has had a significant impact on national tax revenue. Therefore, the investigation is being carried out with extreme diligence, hoping to crack the case in the shortest possible time in order to deter criminals and emphasize the importance of taxation.</p>

<h3 id="e119">After Xia Housheng's Death, His Concubine Sues on Behalf of Her Son, Sues Principal Wife to Confirm Biological Son <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Xia Housheng, a local resident and owner of Shunyu Rice Store at No. 20, Remi Road, French Concession, lived in the store with his wife, Xia Li (41 years old this year), son, Shan Zhang (15 years old), and daughter, Xiuzhi (11 years old). In August 1933, he took Zhu (23 years old), a local young woman, as a concubine and rented a house for her at No. 8, Xinxingshun Lane, Gansidong Road, where they lived together. Unfortunately, Xia Housheng died of illness on October 26 of last year. On June 20 of this year, Xia's concubine Zhu gave birth to a posthumous son, named Baobao. Because the mother and son were not tolerated by the principal wife, Xia Zhu, in her capacity as the legal representative, along with her son Baobao, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Xia Li, Xia Shanzhang, and Xia Xiuzhi, the mother, son, and daughter, seeking a division of Xia Housheng's estate. During the initial trial, the plaintiff Xia Zhu presented Qian, the second landlord, to the court to testify that Xia Housheng had lived with Xia Zhu during his lifetime. As a result, the court ruled that Xia Baobao should receive a proportionate share of Xia Housheng's estate with Xia Shanzhang and Xia Xiuzhi, while the part of the lawsuit concerning Xia Zhu was dismissed. The defendant, Xia Li, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but the court ruled to change the original verdict and dismissed the appellant's original lawsuit, as the appellee Xia Baobao had not had his identity confirmed. Now, Xia Zhu, again in her capacity as the legal representative, using her son's real name Xia Baobao, hired lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to file a lawsuit in the court of the Second Special District against Xia Li, Xia Shanzhang, Xia Xiuzhi, and others, seeking confirmation of the illegitimate son. Yesterday, Judge Tu Shenjie held a hearing in the Sixth Civil Court. The plaintiff, Xia Baobao's legal representative Xia Zhu, and her lawyer appeared in court. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiff stated the grounds for the lawsuit and the object of the requested ruling. The defendants' lawyer, Lu Congzu, appeared in court and presented three points of defense, stating that the defendants did not know that the plaintiff was born to Xia Zhu, nor did they know that Xia Housheng had taken Xia Zhu as a concubine during his lifetime. Regarding the legal points, they had already been determined in the previous judgment on estate division, and they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court questioned Xia Zhu, the plaintiff's mother, about her cohabitation with Xia Housheng during his lifetime and the circumstances of the birth of her son. After the judge concluded the questioning, he announced the adjournment and scheduled the verdict for the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>The Huikang Steamer, belonging to the Shanghai Branch of the Huitong Steamship Company, hit a reef in Quanzhou on its way to Xiamen. The forward hold is flooded. There are ongoing discussions to send a ship to rescue it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reef Impact in Quanzhou. The Huikang Steamer, belonging to Huitong Steamship Company, located at No. 44 Guangdong Road, Shanghai, has been sailing to various coastal ports without a fixed route. This time, it was fully loaded with soybean cakes, soybeans, and other items from Yingkou and Yantai to be unloaded at various ports in South China. The ship first arrived in Quanzhou, Fujian. On the 23rd of this month, it unloaded all cargo in Quanzhou. At that time, 430 tons of cargo for Xiamen were still left in the hold, which was to be transported by the ship. On the 23rd, after departing from Quanzhou and sailing to the vicinity of Dazhui Island at the port, at approximately 5:00 AM, due to fog, the ship mistakenly struck a submerged reef.</p>
<p>Two Holds Flooded. At the time when the Huikang Steamer struck the reef, its first and second holds were breached by the submerged reef. The forward hold and the first hold suddenly flooded, causing danger. At this time, the ship was unable to move. Shanghai only received the shipowner's urgent telegram requesting rescue at 4:00 PM yesterday. The original telegram stated: "Huikang departed Quanzhou for Xiamen yesterday, hit submerged reef at Quanzhou port at 5:00 AM, first and second holds flooded, ran aground immediately due to danger, please send rescue ship quickly." There are 430 tons of loaded cargo in the hold.</p>
<p>Rapidly Ran Aground. After the ship flooded, the shipowner, seeing that the situation was critical and fearing that it would sink at sea, immediately steered the Huikang Steamer towards the shallow waters off the northern coast of Dazhui Island to ground the ship. The depth of the water at high tide is 18 feet 2 inches, and at low tide it is 6 feet. The draft of the Huikang Steamer is 8 feet 7 inches forward and 12 feet 9 inches aft. The hull of the forward hold has been breached in two places.</p>
<p>Rescue Efforts. After receiving the report in Shanghai, in addition to notifying the China Ship Insurance Joint Association, the shipowner and agent in Quanzhou were urgently telegraphed, ordering them to dispatch barges to unload the cargo in case it was necessary. Mr. Lu Huichuan, general manager of Huitong Company in Shanghai, also discussed with the Insurance Joint Association and quickly dispatched a rescue ship to the scene. Director Tang of the China Ship Insurance Joint Association agreed last night to send workers with cement materials to the scene to first repair the breached holes in the ship before towing it away.</p>
<p>Ship Condition. The Huikang Steamer was built in Italy in 1902. The hull is steel, the gross tonnage is 1599 tons, the registered tonnage is 936 tons, the length is 258 feet, the width is 24 feet, the depth is 22 feet, the draft is 17 feet 4 inches, it has three decks, the machinery is a triple expansion type, the horsepower is 850, the steam pressure is 180, and it can travel at 10.5 nautical miles per hour. The ship has a peace of mind insurance policy of 80,000 yuan with the China Ship Insurance Joint Association.</p>

<p>At around 8:00 PM, three robbers suddenly entered the Huichangxiang Tailor Shop at No. 1222 Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen, Nanshi. All were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants and spoke with a Xuzhou accent. One robber acted as a lookout, while the other two broke into the shop. They immediately stole a gray melton overcoat and a black cashmere camel hair overcoat, worth a total of 70 to 80 yuan. After obtaining the stolen goods, the robbers fled westward. Zhang Minghong, an apprentice at the shop, followed and shouted "Catch the thief!" Yuan Huanwen, No. 351 of the third team of the Rong Security Corps, heard the alarm and bravely chased after them. The robbers threw away the two stolen overcoats at the entrance of the Youth Propaganda Group and continued to flee westward. Rong Huanwen of the Security Corps chased them to the intersection of Daxing Street, where Officer Guo Zixu of post No. 28 of the Ximen Branch Bureau came out to assist. Yuan Huanwen of the Security Corps and Guo Zixu apprehended one robber. (The other two robbers escaped without a trace.) According to the interrogation, the robber was named Wang Asan, 33 years old, from Xuzhou. At the same time, two suspects, Yang Shiliang, from Tianjin, and Han Yangshi, were apprehended at No. 36 Xietu Road, along with a coat. All were taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau for interrogation, and the escaped robbers and their accomplices are being vigorously pursued.</p>

<p>Hypnotism is the Most Painless Way to Quit Smoking: In recent years, civilized countries have applied hypnotism to correct bad habits with considerable success. Using it to quit smoking is even more painless. Smokers, once hypnotized, become indifferent to opium, thus their addiction can be eliminated invisibly. Physical symptoms can also be prevented and treated in advance. It is truly a novel approach among new smoking cessation methods. Dr. Li Shaoguang, a renowned psychotherapist at 662 Weihaiwei Road in this city, is skilled in various Western psychological therapies, especially hypnotism. He has extensive experience and remarkable results. He is now opening a special program using the latest hypnotism techniques to quit smoking painlessly during this period of strict smoking prohibition, providing a quick and convenient solution for smokers with weak constitutions. Those who cannot endure the pain of needles and medicine or have tried to quit without success may wish to try it. Dr. Li's telephone number is 35749.</p>

<p>Announced by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation</p>
<p>Article 5 of Chapter 1: The free throw area arc is to be marked with a dotted line and extended into a full circle. This free throw circle is to restrict other players from standing close to the jumpers when the jump ball takes place on the free throw line. The entire text is changed as follows:</p>
<p>The free throw area is marked at both ends of the court. Each area is divided by two straight lines six feet apart, parallel to and equidistant from the sidelines of the court. One end of the two parallel lines intersects the end line of the court. The other end connects to a large arc with a radius of six feet. The center of the circle should be equidistant from the sidelines on both sides of the court and seventeen feet from the inside edge of the end line of the court. The small arc of the circle (the arc drawn in the middle of the two parallel lines) should be a dotted line.</p>
<p>Article 3 of Chapter 5: Add a section after the note to avoid delays when substituting players. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To facilitate players in identifying their opponents, when a substitute enters the court, they should report their number and position to the referee or inspector. If possible, the number of their opponent should not be reported. The substitute may speak with the player being substituted to ask who their opponent is. The purpose of this note is to prevent common errors and delays during substitutions.</p>
<p>Article 10 of Chapter 7 modifies the definition of "dribbling." A ball that falls from the hand or an action to obtain the ball does not count as dribbling. That is, after the ball leaves the hand or is tapped out of a crowd, a player may start dribbling. If the player has a better chance of getting the ball this way, but deliberately moves the ball forward after getting it, it should be considered a walk. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>After a player obtains the ball, throwing, tapping, or rolling the ball and then touching the ball again before it is touched by another person is called "dribbling." When dribbling, the ball must touch the ground except for one "air dribble." That is, when a player starts dribbling, they may throw the ball into the air, or during dribbling, they may tap the ball into the air once with their hand. Before the ball lands, they may touch the ball again.</p>
<p>After the above action, if the player touches the ball with both hands simultaneously or stops the ball in one hand or both hands, the dribble ends. When the hand is not touching the ball, the player may run an unlimited number of steps. Between each two taps of the ball during dribbling, the player may run at will, without being limited in the number of steps.</p>
<p>(Note) The following examples are not considered dribbling:</p>
<p>(1) Continuing to shoot (i.e., consecutive shots), (2) A ball that falls from the hand, (3) A ball tapped from the hands of another player, (4) Tapping the ball out when trying to get the ball in a crowd, (5) Intercepting a pass and gaining possession. Article 1 of Chapter 8 changes the break time for games of ten minutes per half to fifteen minutes, but it may be reduced to ten minutes if both sides agree. The text of the first two sections is revised as follows:</p>
<p>At the start of the game, the referee or inspector should throw the ball up between two opposing players in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of this chapter. College-age team games should be divided into two halves, each half lasting twenty minutes, with a fifteen-minute break between the halves. If both sides agree, the break time may be reduced to ten minutes.</p>
<p>Add two sentences after Article 6 of Chapter 8. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Other players should each stand at a reasonable distance from the jumper and the referee (or inspector) before the ball is touched by the jumper.</p>
<p>When jumping on the free throw line, all players except the jumpers should stand outside the free throw circle before the ball is touched.</p>
<p>Note to Article 1 of Chapter 10: If the space outside the boundary line of the court is less than three feet, a dotted line should be drawn three feet inside the line to restrict guarding players from standing too close when throwing the ball in from out of bounds. The full text is as follows: If the space outside the boundary line of the court is less than three feet, both players should stand more than three feet away from the thrower. A clear dotted line should be marked three feet inside the boundary line of the court.</p>
<p>Add a sentence after Section 4 of Article 1 of Chapter 11. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Players who are disqualified from the game may also be given a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>Part of Section 5 of Article 1 of Chapter 11 has been changed. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>For all other types of foul free throws, the time should be counted from the moment the foul occurs until the ball is thrown in from out of bounds, crossing the boundary line.</p>
<p>Free Throw, Chapter 13, the first sentence of Article 5: This is an important change within these rules. After a free throw for a personal foul is made, play continues with a throw-in from out of bounds. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>If a free throw for a personal foul is made, a player from the free thrower's opposing team should throw the ball into the court from any point outside the end line to continue the game. If it is a series of free throws, the above rule only applies to the last free throw.

<h3 id="e149">First Battle of the Public Exhibition Cup: Western Youth Slightly Superior <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Winning 3-1 Overall, Today's Four Singles Matches</p>
<p>The 7th International Public Exhibition Cup Handball Tournament opened at the Western Youth Stadium at 5:45 PM yesterday. Five singles matches were originally scheduled, but Hua Fenggang was unable to participate due to unforeseen circumstances. With the consent of both sides, it was changed to be held today. In yesterday's four matches, China only won one. The defeats in the first and third matches were the most regrettable. However, there are still six singles matches and five doubles matches in the first round. If the Chinese team can give their all, it should not be difficult to quell the arrogant foreign team.</p>
<p>Hong Yukui's Great Delight</p>
<p>Yesterday's matches were the 7th, 3rd, 1st, and 9th groups. Hong Yukui of the 7th group played against Banairnal first. Hong is one of the mainstays of the Chinese Youth team, repeatedly defeating strong opponents. He once won the Shanghai Chinese Open Championship. Last year, he partnered with Zhu Kuan to win the Shanghai Doubles Open Championship. He is young and strong, so Banairnal was no match for him. After coming on the court, he used his bold and sweeping strokes, like a hot knife through butter, winning two games in a row with scores of 21-17 and 21-12, winning as easily as turning his hand.</p>
<p>Yan Peiqiu's Skill is High, But Strength is Weak</p>
<p>Yan Peiqiu of the third group played against Lakimbi. Lakimbi is known as a "sticky candy," while Yan is superior in skill, so their strengths are considered equal. The score of the first game was very close. Yan only won at 22-20. Starting in the second game, Yan fell behind 12-19 and used his skills to fight back hard, tying the game at 19. Just when he expected to be smooth sailing, he exhausted himself by being too brave. Lakimbi won two points in a row, making it one game each. After a short rest, each side exerted their full strength in the decisive third game. Yan started smoothly, taking an 18-13 lead. At the crucial moment, Yan suddenly had a leg cramp, greatly weakening his strength. He was countered by Lakimbi, who won the third game 21-19. It can be said that it was extremely unfortunate.</p>
<p>Zhu, the King of Balls, Lost Due to Underestimation</p>
<p>Zhu Kuan in the handball world is like Li Huitang in the football world, while Ke Klin is also a main player for Western Youth. The competition must be fierce when two heroes meet. However, after the start of the first game, Zhu lost the first game due to excessive underestimation. In the second game, Zhu showed off his smashing and pressing skills, scoring 21-5 to retaliate. In the crucial third game, Zhu took a 19-16 lead. Just when victory seemed to be in his grasp, bad luck struck. Ke Klin repeatedly used dangerously low balls to tie the score. The last two balls were so dangerous that they could not be saved by human power. The best winning situation was wasted, resulting in a miserable defeat. Zhu is known as a victorious general, and it is easy to imagine his frustration after this setback.</p>
<p>Western Youth Leads 3-1</p>
<p>The Chinese team suffered two consecutive blows, and their morale was low. Sun Baoqi in the ninth group then took the field against Bai Xu. Sun shouted loudly and was exceptionally brave. He repeatedly escaped danger in the first game, using clever tricks to defeat Bai Xu, making Bai Xu shake his head and concede defeat. The second game was even more tense. Sun fought calmly, repeatedly taking the lead. However, in the second half of the game, Bai Xu steadily pressed forward, while Sun's strength gradually declined, and he finally lost. It became a tie. In the third game, he was exhausted. Although he tried his best, it was difficult to save the situation, and he was defeated 2-1 by Bai Xu. In summary, Western Youth led 3-1 after the first day of competition. The results of each game and today's schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>Results of Each Group</p>
<p>7th Group: Hong Yukui 21-17, 21-12, defeated Banairnal</p>
<p>3rd Group: Lakimbi 20-22, 21-19, 21-19, defeated Yan Peiqiu</p>
<p>1st Group: Ke Klin 21-6, 5-21, 21-19, defeated Zhu Kuan</p>
<p>9th Group: Bai Xu 19-21, 21-12, 21-8, defeated Sun Baoqi</p>

It is said that the four specialized schools, such as the Peiping Taxation School, have decided to move south. However, it is not known that the Peiping Taxation School has already moved south to Shanghai to enrich the school affairs and merge with the branch school for more than half a year.</p>

<p>So he went away, smiling, high on his mother's shoulder, with a drowsy sweetness that made him perfectly irresistible.</p>
<p>But when the evening talk was all done, and the sweet songs were all sung, and the house was full of the Sunday quiet that always seemed to have a flavor of its own, Don lay awake in his cozy room, thinking over the new thoughts, and feeling the stir of new hopes and desires in his little heart; for the good angels, Love and Gratitude, had come in; and, having Time and Patience to help them, would surely do their work well. Earnest to keep his vow, Don clasped his small hands in the dark, and softly repeated Tanty's short prayer:</p>
<p>"God bless everybody, and make me good."</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII. LOST.</p>
<p>ONE fine autumn afternoon the Plumfield Square echoed with the clatter of tin pails, the tramp of excited feet, and the sound of children's voices, clamoring for something to eat,—for the boys and girls were going blackberrying on the Great Meadow, and were making their preparations with as much bustle as if they were about to start on a voyage of discovery.</p>
<p>"Now, my dears, go quietly, and don't let Rob see you, if you can help it," said Mrs. Jo, as she tied a wide-brimmed hat over little Nan's curly head.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Securities – News Deteriorates – Bond Selling Pressure Suddenly Increases <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Reduction of Troops Actually Squeezed More, Down Over Two Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was on the last day of futures trading for this month. Due to the sudden deterioration of the situation in North China, people were quite worried. However, because many parties feared that a sharp drop would make it impossible to exit, there was both a pull-up and an exit. Selling from No. 54 was very lively. Others, such as the Northern Gang, as well as Nos. 33 and 78, all enthusiastically dumped or exited. Only relying on the relationship between long and short positions was there some pulling power. Otherwise, there would have been a risk of a sharp drop. The market opened with a surge of selling pressure. Although the bullish side pulled up whenever there was a fall, there was still a sense of imminent collapse. Market prices uniformly fell between 0.13 and 0.67 yuan. The market still had no major changes. Gradually, the pulling power began to weaken. In the second session, most of the gangs sold, and the amount sold by No. 54 was even greater than in the first session. However, there were also many short-covering positions among them, and market prices still had a sense of firmness in the weakness. Therefore, one or two varieties were still slightly better by 0.12 yuan, while the rest continued to weaken, falling another 0.23 to 0.7 yuan. At closing, bad news suddenly turned to squeeze shorts, especially regarding the reduction of troops. The sellers were mostly No. 78, who had been strongly pulling up the market every day this month. It fell another yuan or several jiao this month. From this, it can be inferred where the previous one-sided price increase was heading. The weaknesses have been exposed, and retail investors will not be fooled again. Other varieties were mostly squeezing shorts. Twenty-two Customs was squeezing shorts. Market prices were quite uneven. Today, only one month of futures trading is being done for December, and market prices will still fluctuate. As a result, market prices uniformly fell by several jiao to over one yuan. Only this month's reduction of troops was down by a small 2.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 40 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>Selling Pressure Suddenly Intensifies, Falling Trend Particularly Fierce – Over 3,000 Bales for Delivery This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market trended lower, and the falling trend was particularly fierce. The sudden serious turn of events in North China caused panic, greatly shocking the market. Selling pressure was particularly intense, and market prices fell. However, the amounts bought by general outsiders have not yet been released. Sales of current yarn are more active than before, but Ruida has already turned bearish. This month's delivery yarn is the last day of business. There are between three and four thousand bales of new chips for delivery. Therefore, the situation weakened in the afternoon. The last traded price was 197.5 jiao, which is 6.5 yuan higher than last month's 181 yuan.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Drops Back Over Three Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market opened lower for each month in the morning, and the falling trend became more intense. Due to the many rumors in the north, people were uneasy, and sellers were active. Except for this month, all months fell by more than two yuan, but some large households still bought in at the low prices. The second and third sessions recovered slightly. By the close, the market had weakened again due to selling by Ruida and others. As a result, each month fell by 1.9 jiao to 2.8 jiao compared to the previous day's close. This month only fell by 0.4 jiao. The market was still firm after opening in the afternoon, with each month rising by 5, 6, or 7 jiao. When the evening extra edition was announced, stating that rioters in North China were rioting, the mood suddenly turned panicky, and selling intensified. The market fell step by step. As a result, each month fell by 7 or 8 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the morning close. The market situation was peaceful this month.

<h3 id="e173">Causes and Effects of Cotton Market Retreat <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Plunges: Rumors Arise Again: Yarn Market Also Small</p>
<p>The cotton market retreated, and the situation became increasingly weak. Because American cotton showed mixed gains and losses, and Indian cotton's falling trend was particularly fierce, people became frustrated. Furthermore, rumors arose in the market, and with the yarn market plummeting, the cotton market fell even further. However, Changhehao took advantage of the low prices to aggressively cover their positions. This month is the last day, and the market situation was pressured by sufficient delivery chips and weakened. The final price was 30.75 yuan, which is 4.55 yuan higher than last month's 325.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Rebound Retreat</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened lower for each month in the morning, and the situation was quite weak. Because overseas American and Indian cotton were both unfavorable, and the decline in Indian cotton was severe, at the same time, the yarn market plummeted, people became sluggish, and there were few traders. The price was down. As a result, each month fell by 0.6 to 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's close. This month only fell by 0.45 yuan. The market situation was glossy after opening in the afternoon. Because Changhe took advantage of the fall and worked hard again, it was firm. When the market reached the second and third sessions, rumors arose again in the market, and people's mood suddenly became false and frustrated. By the close, Tongji, Meiji, and outsiders tightly held on to their large holdings and refused to release them, and it rose again by 0.2 jiao. As a result of the close, each month fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning close. There are 70,000 "dan" of deliveries this month. It was found that Tongfu sold 1,200 "dan," Dafeng 1,400 "dan," Daji 1,900 "dan," Yuanda 1,200 "dan," Mingde 1,500 "dan," Gengfeng 9,000 "dan," Tongfeng 3,300 "dan," Yicheng 1,600 "dan," Weiyan 2,600 "dan," Yikang 4,900 "dan," Yuanxingchang 5,100 "dan," Changyu 2,300 "dan," Yongda 1,600 "dan." Dafu bought 3,600 "dan," Meiji 3,500 "dan," Tongji 3,600 "dan," Zhenda 1,000 "dan," Senkang 1,200 "dan," Yuan 1 2,9 "dan," Xincheng 4,7 "dan," Changhe 15,300 "dan," Changfeng 1,600 "dan," and Runkang 1,7 "dan."

<p>A foreign firm in this city received a telegram from New York on November 24, stating that the cotton market was heavily shorted at the close today. The director of the US Cotton Reserve Agency, Johnson, also stated that the Reserve Agency would not open again until cotton farmers had released the cotton produced from their principal capital. However, the opening date would be considered after the eighth estimate is released in December. It is currently found that there are only 10,000 licensed bales in storage, and it is expected that there will not be many delivered on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Food – Flour and Wheat Suddenly Recover Slightly in the Afternoon <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was robust in the morning, but reversed and fell in the afternoon. Quotations for foreign wheat: Chicago continued to rise by 34 jiao, and Canada by 23 jiao. Due to the continued rise in foreign wheat, market sentiment was stable as usual. Then, foreign bulls believed that current wheat could not be procured, and domestic chips were becoming increasingly empty, so buying was unusually strong. Each month continued to be better by one point compared to the previous week's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market suddenly saw a big softness. Due to rumors of riots in Tianjin, there were reports from both public and private sectors, and the Tianjin gang transactions unanimously recovered. Bulls who had profited also recovered very smoothly, so near and far terms gradually collapsed, falling about one or two points compared to the previous week's closing price.</p>

<p>April 3.2125 3.2025 0.0100</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market still saw light trading in the morning. However, foreign wheat quotations rose by 234 jiao, and the market atmosphere was stable. However, there were few buyers, and it was not easy to rise. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month was the last day of trading. The opening was not traded, and after the second session, due to bulls recovering and rumors of changes in Tianjin, near and far terms uniformly loosened. However, due to the lack of chips for new sellers, there were few releases, and all the bulls recovered, showing slight weakness. Compared to the previous week's closing price, it fell by 234 points. In the current wheat market, due to the limited underlying code and the scarcity of high-quality goods, the highest prices have opened at 5.4 yuan, which is 34 points better than the previous week. Bengbu Mingguang wheat opened at 5.04 yuan, Shaheji wheat at 5.02 yuan, Qianjiao wheat at 4.95 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 4.845 yuan, Tiantai wheat at 4.89 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 4.89 yuan. Fuxin took 3,000 bags, and Xinda took 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from each gang still had about 40 households (about 8,000 "shi" of goods). The sales market in this street was initially normal. Later, it was seen that the customer gang was trying to handle several thousand packages of thick japonica rice, and the market became tight. However, as a result, the price of thick early japonica rice only rose or fell by a few points. Thin indica rice Tianjin gang handled over 3,000 packages. The market atmosphere was still demanding with a critical outlook, and the market was set. Duyang tip was still firm. There was still some scattered movement in the Yinyuan fortunately, and the market was also set.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 44 or 45 ships from the Hexia gangs. The market situation: merchants in the market took good goods for each type of rice slightly, and retail stores were normal. The market situation was stable. There was continued movement in Yangjianbu tip retail, and the price was slightly tight. Baiyuan was stable. Kejian was stable. Thin indica rice Tianjin continued to be available, and retail was slightly active, with tight prices. Early rice and other goods were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Customer Xian Northern Gang Completely Stopped Handling <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer xian rice was still prosperous. The market sentiment was originally hoping for the best. Merchants originally intended to continue absorbing. The street was also greedy, so after the morning opening price, each grade was uniformly brisk, especially the middle grade rice, which was actually sold actively. The price rose by 5 points to about a corner. High-quality goods were slightly firm. Then, the sudden rise of rumors in the market caused merchants to immediately stop. The Northern Gang completely stopped handling. In the afternoon, due to the outbreak of riots in Tianjin, the Northern Gang and merchants were nervous and sought to exit. The street's response was limited. The market and people's mood immediately returned to level, and the price also returned a few points lower than the high value in the morning. The opening of Gan rice was 3,600 bags, Wental rice was 2,000 bags, Shaoxing rice was 1,000 bags, and Nanjing Anqing rice was 734 bags, all distributed by merchants in this street.</p>

<p>—Sesame Price High, Foreign Firm Does Not Move—</p>
<p>Foreign firm rapeseed: because the local stock is only two or three thousand bags, and the internal collection is also less than 20,000 bags, people's hearts are firm and bullish, and the route to Japan is quite strong, so the market rose by another corner, opening at 9.2 yuan, with 1,500 bags traded. After foreign firm sesame rose to 12 yuan, there were no telegrams from foreign countries to add more handling, so the market situation was downstream. Yesterday, 300 tons were opened, and the price was 11.8 yuan. The later situation seemed to be slack, and there may be continued repairs. Raw sesame seeds: because foreign firms are at a loss in matching them, the market price fell by two or three jiao. The whole market was handled by this street and Japanese retail households, with more than 450 bags of Guan store sesame, and 300 bags of Bengbu sesame.</p>

<p>123,000 Pieces To Be Delivered Within Two Months</p>
<p>The rise and fall of soybean cakes is concentrated on whether the Shantou route is moving or not. Since the factory transport merchants jointly petitioned in Beijing, the order was given to resume work, but the cancellation of additional donations has not been seen. Shantou transport merchants held a meeting yesterday to discuss and decided to start purchasing forward soybean cakes first. After the order is issued free of charge, they will transport and装them. Therefore, they started purchasing yesterday. It is estimated that Rencheng, Tong'an, Yifu, and other factories have completed the transaction of a total of 123,000 pieces of four-brand cakes. Among them, 38,000 pieces are scheduled to be cleared within December, with a price of 1.53 yuan, supplied by Suifeng, Changde, Dayou, Dade, Shunyu, and Tongsheng. Another 85,000 pieces are scheduled to be cleared within January 15, with a price of 1.55 yuan, supplied by Sui, Changde, Dayou, and Dade.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak. The guild's quoted price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 21.95 yuan, and the price for re-export sugar was 6.95 yuan, but neither transaction occurred. The price for Zhen Ji No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory was 21 yuan, unchanged. Numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were subject to price reductions. Transactions at the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company's public auctions were scarce. For example, Five Rams Cantonese coarse white sugar was bid at 21.95 yuan, a slight decrease of one jiao compared to last Friday. Re-export Dutch coarse white sugar was at 6.95 yuan, and secondary No. 3 refined white sugar was at 20.5 yuan, but neither transaction occurred. Only 20 bags of No. 2 refined white sugar were sold at 21.2 yuan, and 10 bags of No. 4 were sold at 21 yuan. Fewer lower-grade goods were offered, and prices showed a decline. Miscellaneous colored packages of white sugar from Qingdao were priced at 10.1 yuan, a decrease of two jiao. Furthermore, over two hundred packages turned red, with the higher-priced ones at 13 yuan and the next at 12.6 yuan, a decrease of approximately one yuan compared to before. Dong brand red sugar was quoted at the original price. Both spot and re-export No. 8 Dong brand white sugar were quoted at a decrease of 0.05 yuan. No. 9 SK brand was quoted at a decrease of 0.1 yuan, but both lacked transactions. However, a small amount of No. 9 re-export sugar was sold at 6.5 yuan.</p>

<p>The selling price of southern fox nuts, which had previously dropped to as low as 40 yuan due to sluggish sales, has recently shown signs of activity, with a perceived increase in demand. Yesterday's market price required 45-46 yuan, an increase of 3-4 yuan. Pond fox nuts were quoted at 20 yuan, with a relatively stable market trend. It is noted that the previous price had reached 18 yuan, an increase of 1-2 yuan as well.</p>

<p>With the weather gradually turning colder, sales of woolen fabrics among woolen goods are thriving. Business in Western and Chinese clothing materials in this city has also increased. The guild's market is showing excellent momentum. Among them, the sales of riding breeches serge are particularly brisk, and the market price has continued to rise. Due to the extraordinarily high exchange rate, Eastern goods have not been delivered in later batches. Domestic goods have temporarily suspended weaving due to rising raw material prices. German, Italian, and Western goods also have limited arrivals due to the exchange rate. This has led to a shortage of spot goods in Shanghai, and market prices are steadily rising. For example, the black and gray color of No. 30 is even more in short supply, and the market is booming. The selling price has risen again. Yesterday, domestic Zhanghua goods all rose to 5.4 yuan, and imported goods with the code 1005 have already risen to 7.5 yuan. Goods in black and gray colors require an additional charge of 0.1-0.2 yuan. (To be continued) (Limited to those with reliable guarantees.)

<p>Two robbers, as they happened to pass a gallows, one of them said with seeming fear, "If there were no such instruments of torture as gallows in the world, how happy would our profession be!" The other robber coldly replied, "Bah! Your view is wrong. You must know that it is precisely our benefactor, because if there were no such things as gallows in the world, then everyone would be doing our job, and our business would become impossible."</p>
<p>A novice writer, submitting his manuscript to the editor, often encounters rejection or is thrown into the paper shredder, but this has also created many famous writers.

<h3 id="e184">Beneath the Tomb of Manshu <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>To call West Lake a scenic area is better to rename it a historic site. Because every temple, bridge, mountain, and flower in that place is named after people. Heroes like Yue Fei, Yu Qian, and Zhang Cangshui, recluses like Lin Bu, Jiang Baishi, Fan Xie, and Jin Nong; even minor figures like the beauties Su Xiaoxiao and Xiaoqing, all leave behind a lasting charm, adding color to the lake and mountains. Therefore, people who travel today invariably mention Wulin: driving around to express feelings is surely not solely for sightseeing. Speaking of the shrines and tombs on the lake, they are also increasing daily, but it is a pity that those whom modern people admire may not be those whom later generations greatly admire. In that case, seek out Manshu. According to Xuan Ying, he waved gold about, dissipated sorrow with beauties, hid as a monk, yet remained somewhat constrained by the words and actions of a monk; only one with good knowledge and great determination could do this. Therefore, when I read his collected works, I am not surprised by his poetry, but I absolutely adore his person and deeds. It is already bitter enough for a scholar to withdraw from society due to frustration. Yet, he could not retreat to a tranquil and solitary state; the pent-up resentment in his heart must have been more than three dou's worth of grievances. If someone were to use him, to bring out what he held within, the feeling of sorrow and weeping could possibly be transformed into policies that would benefit the people. "Looking out, the land is full of useless men, in robes, tears before the stele." "Thank you, Liu San, for the news, I still have a small life to be a poet monk." However, those who understood him in the world were only Liu San; those who could be told were the heroes of past generations, but there was no one to confide in. Thus, he wandered the world, ending in depression. His fate was unfortunate, and his person was thus all the more worth remembering. The tomb is located on the shady side of Gushan, a few hundred paces from Xiling Bridge, and those who tour the lake often pass by. I used to stay by the lake and, during vacations, would drive there every day, leaning on the grass and rubbing the stele, often not returning until the moon rose. Sometimes I would hear the bell of Fenglin Monastery emerging from the edge of the forest, and facing this mound of earth, I would feel the awe of what era this was! "The dust of ages is viewed like this, gather the remaining tears to await a clear time." I do not know for whom this is made? This autumn, I once again spoke with Meng Jiao in the dark about it, thinking that the grass on the tomb must be fine, while we have both reached middle age; the stars were like rain, and clear sounds erupted, does the person in the tomb know? To express feelings with a poem, why must it be said for him? "Covered in autumn dew, watching the stars, a pestle, vast tracks of dust. The daily lesson, the monk laughs to himself, how could he have thought someone was listening to the bell?"</p>
<h3 id="e185">Anecdotes of the Executioner <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Everyone knows that an executioner is someone who kills people. Because in the past, during the monarchical era, all executions of criminals were carried out by beheading. Beheading required an executioner! It is said that an executioner's beheading, like other professions, requires practice. Their method of practicing is to use large steamed buns to test their skill. With one strike, the upper half of the bun must roll off. And they draw a black line on the bun, and the blade must be aligned with this black line. At first, it is naturally not accurate. But over time, they can be perfect, and then they can become executioners and be competent and happy.</p>
<p>According to old people, an executioner can only kill with one strike. If the person does not die with one strike, they cannot strike a second time. Therefore, executioners must be well-trained before they dare to go to the execution ground. I remember hearing a story like this: "A robber was caught by the authorities. Because he had committed many crimes, he was naturally unforgivable and was sentenced to death. His wife was beautiful, and their relationship was very good. So she always wanted to save him. So she sacrificed her body to get to know the executioner and said, 'Unfortunately, I have a robber husband, and although he is about to be executed, it is already too late! If the executioner is willing to have me, I am willing to be his wife forever.' The executioner was of course willing. The night before her husband's execution, she told the executioner, 'My husband's braid is very good. Please cut it off for me tomorrow to make a wig.' The executioner was already infatuated with her and naturally obeyed her orders. So the next day, when he killed her husband, he first cut off his braid. Just as he was about to cut his neck, the robber's wife suddenly ran out of the crowd and shouted that he had already been struck once! The supervising officer had no choice but to immediately let the robber down and had this executioner represent him and had another executioner behead him! At this time, although the executioner knew he had been greatly deceived, it was already too late!"</p>

<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>I remember just a few days ago! The second page of this newspaper carried an article by Mr. Feng Zikai about a double life, saying, "...On the one hand, the newspaper publishes divorces, on the other hand, it is building chastity arches... Next to new-style cars, there will also be sedan chairs carried by four people. This is the so-called double life of the Chinese..." But what I am recording here is even better than a double life! The facts are like this.</p>
<p>On the tenth of this month, our small rural town—Yinxiang Port—suddenly became lively. The general male and female villagers, young and old, each held a stick of incense with great devotion, crowding in the crowd, almost breaking this narrow little street. If you want to use an adjective to describe them, then only "a sea of people" is worthy of it. Such excitement is only the first time in our small town! But the reason for the excitement is indeed difficult to guess. Later, I asked someone on the inside (the initiator of this matter), who said: "The Land God is getting married!"</p>
<p>"Ah! It's really strange. Only people have marriages. How can the Bodhisattva get married? Could it be a joke?" I asked him incredulously, and he told me a strange story:</p>
<p>"There is a Land Temple on the north side of the Wang Family Guanyin Hall in this town. There is a Bodhisattva inside. Because it has gained the belief of the general villagers, people often go to burn incense and worship. On the 27th of last month, a young girl also went to burn incense. When she finished worshiping, just as she stood up, she suddenly smiled. Unexpectedly, the Bodhisattva took a fancy to her. Sure enough, the girl got sick and died soon after returning home. Because of this reason, her mother suspected that she must have been taken by the Land God to be his concubine. So she made this wooden statue for her and chose today (a good day) to marry them both."</p>
<p>When I finished listening to this strange story, I couldn't help but sigh repeatedly, not only lamenting the villagers' pitiful superstition, but also that at a time when rural areas are bankrupt and markets are exhausted, there should not be such pointless actions. But we Chinese are not like that! No matter how loudly people shout "get rid of superstition," they are always dreaming of superstition. But this is not that era now. It's really sad to say; the day before yesterday, the Boy Scouts of the Flood Relief Association came to this town to raise donations, but they didn't get a single penny. But today's event, just the consumption of incense alone, reached several hundred yuan! How can the Chinese not be poor? How can they not be bullied?</p>

<p>As for economic matters, that would be a joke. I'm afraid you don't understand what a monetary system or a gold standard is. You just know that goods pass in front of your office, and you collect a few coins from people. I fundamentally despise you. If it weren't for the money, I wouldn't have come to find you even if we hadn't been in touch for ten years. After this scolding, Bei Hai was also stunned. Is there a wife who scolds her husband like this? Zhi Qian also shook his head a few times and smiled at Bei Hai. Bei Hai was about to say something, but Zhi Qian waved his hand at him and pointed to the room next door, meaning to tell him to listen down there. So the two of them looked at each other and listened to the next room. The director, after receiving this scolding, seemed unable to bear it and let out a short, sharp sound, replying: "Are these the words you're saying to me? It was very difficult for me to take leave and come to Xi'an to pick you up. Now you want me to get the money, and after I get the money, you want me to send it to you. This round trip will take so much effort. If my superiors find out and cancel my job, I'm naturally finished. What advantage can you gain? If you still plan to ask for thousands of dollars, then kill me, and I still can't get it out! If you want to get the money, then you have to go to Gansu with me." The sound of these words came from far to near and was very similar to the way the woman spoke. While speaking, he heard the woman put something down, heavily hitting the table with a bang, and then said: "Okay, as long as you can get the money, I will go to Gansu with you. Don't be like this, get away." There was a sound of staggering footsteps, and the man dragged out his voice and said: "That place can't compare to Xi'an. You eat black steamed buns, drink mud water, and there aren't even green vegetables and radishes..." (366)</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3 id="e189">Filling Dishes with Flowers and Fruits <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Food is one of the four essential elements of life and cannot be interrupted for a single day. All the treasures of the mountains, the delicacies of the sea, the running of the beasts, and the flying of the birds are all gathered to satisfy the appetite. How great is mankind's insatiable desire for food! However, there are also those who pick flowers and fruits to make delicacies, which are exceptionally refined and delightful. According to my knowledge, I will haphazardly record some on the left:</p>
<p>1.  Stuffed Lotus Root: Peel the lotus root and cut it into thin slices. Grind the meat into a paste, mix in sesame oil, salt, flour, etc., and sandwich it between two slices of lotus root. Deep fry it in a frying pan until golden brown, then remove it and eat it with sweet sauce. It has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>2.  Jade Embryo Soup: Li Mei'an's family recipe has a Jade Embryo Soup. The method is to make a soup with late winter jade (a type of mushroom) and Yunnan bamboo shoots. The shoots are tender and the jade is fragrant, creating two wonderful flavors.</p>
<p>3.  Snow Pear Chicken: Slaughter the chicken and take the meat, cutting it into thin slices. Stir-fry it three or four times in lard, then add sesame oil and stir-fry it again. Then add salt, pepper powder, and pear slices and rock sugar, and it is ready. The taste is extremely crisp and refreshing.</p>
<p>4.  Pumpkin Cake: Pumpkin flowers can also be cooked and eaten. When I lived in a certain family, I once picked a number of flowers in the early morning, mixed them with flour and cane sugar, and fried them in boiling oil until they were slightly charred. I scooped them out, put them on a plate to serve as snacks, and tasted them. They were rich, delicious, sweet, and fragrant beyond description. At that time, the old painter Bing He was also present and praised them endlessly, saying that such a good taste should be described by you to make up for the shortcomings of the ancient people's food recipes.</p>
<p>5.  Watermelon Duck: Choose a round watermelon, cut off its top, scoop out the pulp, place duck and slices of southern ham, tender bamboo shoots, dried scallops, and winter mushrooms inside. Add yellow wine and salt, seal it with mulberry paper, steam it in a pot over water until cooked through. It is rich, fragrant, and delicious, an unparalleled delicacy for summer family dishes.</p>
<p>6.  Blanched Magnolia Petals: Pick magnolia buds and remove the petal tips. Separately use flour and white sugar, mix in chicken eggs, and mix evenly with chopsticks. Soak the magnolia petals in it, then blanch them in a sesame oil pan until they are dry and crispy.</p>
<p>7.  Osmanthus Eggs: Use chicken eggs, diced ham, and osmanthus sauce and stir-fry them together. Those who like sweet flavors can add rock sugar, and those who like salty flavors can add salt. This is a famous dish in Zhangde, Henan Province.</p>
<p>8.  Chestnut Chicken: First boil the chicken pieces until they are golden brown, add yellow wine, soy sauce, and chestnuts to the pot, cover and simmer. Finally, add white sugar and remove from the pot immediately.</p>
<p>9.  Chrysanthemum Shark Fin: Use washed shark fin, taking the soft spines. Next, boil the chicken until cooked, taking only the skin. Then cut the meat into shreds, stir-fry it in an oil pan, add yellow wine and soy sauce, and braise it with cabbage until cooked. Then wrap the shark fin in the chicken skin, add it to the stew, and cover it with fresh chrysanthemum threads. The taste is both fragrant and the color is beautiful. Cantonese restaurants are best at making this dish.</p>
<p>10. Hawthorn Jelly: Use one or two pieces of hawthorn cake, add white sugar, cocoa, and osmanthus sauce, then pour boiling water over it. Served occasionally at the edge of a banquet, it is refreshing and unparalleled.</p>
<p>11. Cherry Blossom Dumplings: At the beginning of summer and the end of spring, people in the Japanese archipelago use cherry blossom leaves to wrap rice cakes, giving it a unique flavor.</p>
<p>12. Lotus Leaf Zha: According to Wu Xing's anecdotes: "In late autumn, the people on the lake make Li Zha. Small fish are added with spices and rice flour, wrapped in lotus leaves, and called Lotus Leaf Zha."</p>
<p>13. Water Chestnut Rice: Wu people must add some water chestnuts to the New Year's Eve dinner and cook them together to symbolize digging for treasure, a comical obsession with wealth.</p>
<p>14. Almond Tofu: Western restaurants have a color of almond tofu, made by boiling almond paste in tofu, mixing it with sugar juice, and storing it in the refrigerator. It is sweet, fragrant, and delicious, and is a good product for cooling off in summer.</p>
<p>15. Fox Nut Congee: Grind fox nuts into powder, cook it with double bow rice, add a little rock sugar, and it is sweet and delicious.</p>
<p>16. Grape Soup: Take purple grapes, peel off their skins, and mix them with sugar syrup to make grape soup. In the autumn of a certain year during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, the Japanese poet Oka Rokumon visited the two gentlemen Xu Huanong and Cai Fuchen in Beijing. Fuchen invited him to drink, and among the snacks was grape soup. Oka Rokumon asked about the history of grapes, and Huanong imitated the ancient people's practice of alluding to events with melon eating, and improvised twenty-eight rhymes to show him.</p>
<p>17. Lychee Duck: Use a clay pot, spread the bottom with lychee meat, season the slaughtered duck, place it on top of the lychees, cover it with lotus leaves, steam it over water for two hours, and then you can take it out and eat it.</p>

<h3 id="e190">A Large Number of Prisoners Released on Parole from Caohejing Prison <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, Shanghai, is well-equipped and large-scale. It houses more than two thousand inmates. There are more than twenty men's and women's workshops. Recently, due to the gradual increase in the number of criminals, there has been a problem of overcrowding. In order to alleviate the prison, the authorities specially followed the order of the Ministry to organize parole. The first batch of more than one hundred people who were approved for parole have been released for many days. The second and third batches of more than one hundred people have been submitted to the High Court and the Garrison Headquarters. The fourth and fifth batches of more than three hundred people have been selected and are rushing to handle the review procedures and will be issued soon. It is estimated that there will be six or seven hundred prisoners who can be paroled this time. A parole ceremony was held, and the warden gave a speech. The prisoners were all awed and delighted.</p>
<p>The imperfection of China's judicial situation is an undeniable fact. The authorities, in view of this, have recently been quite determined to make up for various shortcomings. The promulgation of the regulations for alleviating prisons is one example. Imprisoning criminals is originally a kind of punishment for lawbreakers. And the intention of legislation is nothing more than to make criminals able to change their ways and become good after being punished. Therefore, civilized countries in the world all take a tolerant attitude towards criminals. Some use education to influence them, or implement parole to listen to their repentance, which is the best way. Now that prisons in our country also have this parole initiative, it is a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition, in prisons throughout our country, except for a few large cities, where new-style prisons have been established, most of the old-style prisons are poorly equipped, and sanitation management is far from perfect. Moreover, the scale of prisons is small, and there are many prisoners. The suffering suffered by prisoners can truly be described as human hell. Especially in recent years, due to the impact of the social downturn, the number of criminals has increased day by day, and prisons everywhere are unable to accommodate them. Therefore, the act of parole is indeed necessary to be fully implemented. Parole can not only alleviate the congestion of prisoners, but also prevent unexpected events from occurring in guardianship. The fact that it is beneficial to the health and nutrition of prisoners is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>Moreover, so-called parole is to select prisoners in prison who have committed less serious crimes, or whose behavior is in line with the rules after entering prison, and who have a tendency to improve, before they are allowed to be released. It is better to give these criminals their freedom than to detain them in prison. In foreign countries, the results of parole are very good. Therefore, we hope that the six or seven hundred prisoners released from Caohejing Prison this time will be able to change their behavior and become good citizens after their release.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that there are many juvenile crimes in our country. In the 21st year, there were a total of 3,004 admissions. In terms of criminal policy and prison system, these juvenile offenders should not be treated in the same way as adult offenders. Therefore, it has been decided to build separate prisons in important cities so that they can receive more complete education, so that they can become healthy young people after they are released from prison in the future. This news is very gratifying and must be considered a progress in the judicial world of our country.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Miscellaneous Notes on the Elephant Kingdom <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Cong Long</p>
<p>Almost everyone who has lived in Siam for a long time feels a deep affection for Siam, especially for its beautiful scenery and interesting customs.</p>
<p>As the ship entered the winding Siamese Gulf, the speed slowed down, and the ship was like a sick elephant, crawling slowly on the lovely and shimmering green water. "Oh, it's arrived, arrived at the port of Siam!" it was shouted, and the whole ship was in turmoil.</p>
<p>On both sides of the green waves, two boundless coconut groves stretched out, towering into the clouds, lush green, connecting to the sky, blending with the jade-like blue sky. Looking through the oily green leaves of the coconut groves, one or two pointed pagoda tops could be seen from time to time, protruding from the gaps in the leaves, shining with brilliant golden color under the hot tropical sun, stabbing like thorns, how dazzling! This is the Siamese Buddhist temple.</p>
<p>In the shallow waters on both sides of the bank, many rows of wooden boats floated, standing still. These boats are a bit different from ordinary cargo ships: they have pavilions and are square. The boats are tightly fastened with thick iron cables, only allowing them to float and rise and fall with the tide, but refusing to let them change their position. This is the Siamese people's "Pa", - home on the water.</p>
<p>Siamese women, like the women of Calingga, expose their upper bodies, allowing their breasts, like new graves, to tremble, pointed and erect, walking on the street without any shyness, with a red and green "benlong" (skirt) wrapped around their lower bodies.</p>
<p>In the evening, after dinner, the sun set, and a remnant of sunlight remained on the horizon. At this time, without any boundaries, they slipped into the river naked. The river suddenly became lively, with the sound of splashing water and the giggling laughter intermingling.</p>
<p>"Splashing water" is very common in Siam, and in many places, it is considered a popular courtesy. Whenever new guests meet, regardless of gender, both parties must splash each other with cold water all over the body. As long as there is water available to splash, it is not enough to show affection if you do not do so. Even when encountering people you don't know at all, you can splash cold water on him (or her) unexpectedly and stand by the roadside laughing.</p>
<p>Water is one of the essential elements of life in Siam, and there is no need to say that the vast rice fields need a lot of water for irrigation. At the same time, because of the hot tropical climate, people cannot withstand the scorching sun and need to take many cool baths every day. As for after death, in addition to holding a cremation ceremony, there is also a so-called water-dripping ceremony, in which the stiff body of the dead person is placed in the house, and the right hand is pulled open. The visitors then walk around the deceased once and drip a few drops of holy water on the palm of the deceased's hand. Thus, the water-dripping ceremony is completed.</p>
<p>There is also a very interesting custom in Siamese men and women's marriage. In Jingmai, as long as a man who does not have a family, in order to seek marriage, he can arbitrarily break into any unfamiliar home. After explaining his intentions, the unmarried girl of that family must come out to sit and talk with him. At this time, the parents in the family avoid going to the outer room or go out, allowing them to talk in detail. If the woman is attracted to the other party, when she personally presents him with a betel leaf roll, the roll is made of two leaves, then it is considered to indicate her consent to the marriage. Then, the man can freely enter and exit the woman's house, sleep and eat at the woman's house, and be considered the woman's quick son-in-law.</p>
<p>I love Siam, I love the beauty and tranquility of its natural scenery; I love the generosity, simplicity, innocence, and unpretentious nature of its people!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Night Train <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>The cold weather brought a dim sky, with a sinister face swallowing the ground.</p>
<p>The north is a plateau region, and the air is dry. Because of this, the warm and humid air of the nearby sea is not visible. After autumn inadvertently slips past in the eyes, the wind will howl. Perhaps the construction of civilization has not yet developed to a certain stage. On the muddy roads of the streets, gray sand runs along, howling like wolves or something else. It hits the rare glass window paper, with a whoosh, then another whoosh.</p>
<p>Guarding an oil lamp, searching around the room, this is worth cherishing, that is also worth cherishing. Although it's not worth much money, the home is about to be moved entirely. Facing all those old belongings, lined with the dim light of the lamp, a wave of desolation swept through the heart, bringing a shiver.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm reluctant to leave home, no, my hometown. I admire the simple and unsophisticated charm of my hometown that is praised by people.</p>
<p>How can that be allowed? Let the longing be hidden first! As before, I rummage through and pack things up.</p>
<p>In the cold weather, the night is long. When everything is ready, stepping out the door, the sky's face is still frighteningly black. Several letters have been prepared, lying on the lid of the suitcase. The window paper is stained with a trace of gray-white.</p>
<p>—Second Master, it's time to go. The train at the East Station leaves at seven o'clock! The pre-arranged rickshaw rushed in, looking somewhat flustered, as if blaming me for being too careless.</p>
<p>There was no time for farewells, so I hastily set off. The morning wind was truly sharp, hitting the face like a knife. The ground and rooftops were tightly covered with thick frost, like a wool carpet. The rickshaw puller's feet stepped on the unsolidified frost, making a croaking sound like a frog.</p>
<p>Following the train wheels, following that expanse of houses and grassland, the hometown disappeared into the heavy darkness.</p>
<p>Arriving in Tianjin, it was midday. I learned that the ship to Shanghai would not depart until the tide rose tomorrow. Moreover, the ship does not enter the port and still needs to go through a section of the Tianjin-Tangshan train. Alas, what a mess. Should I just stay at the station and wait for night? Or should I go to Tangshan to wait first? Hesitating for a long time, I finally accepted the inn's offer and went to the hostel first.</p>
<p>Half a day passed quickly, and the ship ticket was bought in advance.</p>
<p>Thankful for the kindness of the shopkeeper, he told me that it was best to leave around nine o'clock. It would take at most an hour to get to Tangshan, and then I could get on the ship right away. It was much better than waiting there for a long time. At the time, I thought this kindness was rare because for someone who had never traveled far, being guided on how to complete the journey ahead was more valuable than anything else.</p>
<p>Following the instructions, I jumped into the train bound for Tangshan at a little past nine o'clock. This section of the journey was not very long. If the ship could enter the port, there would be no need for this section of the train. The number of people on the train could be said to be very few. The tea attendant huddled around a small stove dozing off. Several gentlemen opened their bedding, covered their heads, and fell soundly asleep. Solemnity enveloped the train. Except for the sound of the wheels grinding against the tracks, occasionally mixed with a few whistles, there were no other sounds.</p>
<p>About a quarter of an hour later, the ticket inspector came, dragged the gentlemen out of their blankets, and asked them to abide by the rules. But in the blink of an eye, they lay down again, muttering incessantly.</p>
<p>He came to me and marked my ticket as usual. Turning around, he saw something in the rice bag.</p>
<p>—What is this? His tone was quite stern.</p>
<p>—A stove, a small one.</p>
<p>As if he had discovered some secret, he immediately reached out and opened the mouth of the sack to take a look:</p>
<p>—Has it been weighed?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>—No, this kind of thing needs to be weighed. He frowned and thought for a while: Then, buy a supplementary ticket!</p>
<p>—How much?</p>
<p>—Humph, about ×× catties, well, let's say two dollars and forty cents!</p>
<p>This was a blow. Although this small stove was my beloved, its purchase price was only two dollars. Now, I actually had to pay a shipping fee higher than the purchase price, so I was naturally unwilling to accept it casually.</p>
<p>—I don't have that much money, do whatever you want with it!</p>
<p>—Throw it out the window! He ordered a colleague. His face turned purple.</p>
<p>—That's fine, it saves me the trouble. I was very calm.</p>
<p>Perhaps he didn't expect me to have this move, and for a moment, he couldn't retort. Looking at his face, he looked very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Later, through persuasion from people on the train, a price of sixty cents was paid to pass the checkpoint.</p>
<p>After taking the money, his anger had not subsided. He opened the door and darted into another carriage.</p>
<p>A gust of cold wind brushed past, and I couldn't help but shiver a few times. Outside the glass window, it was pitch black. The whistle on the front of the train stretched out its voice and shouted.</p>

<p>Frugality Song</p>
<p>(1) In the world, who doesn't desire wealth and status? If you don't plan ahead, how can daily expenses be determined? Establishment is most difficult, destruction is extremely rapid!

<p>Opening: "Maiden's Sigh"</p>
<p>The moon is faint, the wind is mournful, and the night fog is thick. A lamp is like water, and my heart is heavy. I sit alone facing the lonely lamp, my intestines about to break. My delicate eyebrows are locked, and tears are thick. I think I am like pear blossoms in the spring rain, lamenting my thin fate. I was wrongly matched for life, full of endless hatred. My husband is aimless and unemployed all day long. He's lost in the paper and gold, like in a dream. He turns day into night, indulging in prostitution and gambling. He only returns home late at night. He squanders money like dirt. He sells off the ancestral property. He doesn't think about the children growing up and needing to study. Now, pitifully, they are neglected at home. I have tried to persuade him several times, but sadly, my loyal words are taken as wind. Alas, I, from a family of scholars, a golden girl. I was spoiled and raised in my boudoir in my childhood. Now, I manage family affairs and do chores myself. In the evening, I still have to do needlework under the lamp. I stay up late guarding the door, full of endless hatred in the silent boudoir. Who can I confide my heartfelt thoughts to? I often fill my chest with tears when I am sad. Sitting idly and eating away the mountains is an ancient saying. The family is gradually getting poorer. The children cry from hunger and cold. The sight hurts my heart, and my sorrow is even deeper. I want to be independent and seek a career. Alas, the world is fickle and people are vicious. I think, I have read poetry and books since I was young and know propriety. I always remember the three obediences and four virtues. How can I learn from those modern women? I endure hardships and spend my days, raising my children to the best of my ability. I often light a stick of incense with a foolish heart, secretly telling my thoughts to the sky. I hope my good man will turn back early and restrain himself. He can glorify the lintel and revive the family. So that I don't have to worry so much.</p>

<p>Opening: "Four Seasons Boudoir Grievances"</p>
<p>Plum blossoms are just beginning to bloom in the small courtyard. I haven't heard from my beloved, who is far away. He promised me that he would return to his hometown when the willows were green. Now, the Dragon Boat Festival has passed, and the pomegranates are red. Spring has passed, summer has come, and autumn has arrived again. The Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet joyfully. I think, even the immortals have a day to meet. You are like a kite with a broken string, without a trace. Autumn has passed. Winter is approaching. A biting wind blows. I'm afraid to look at the desolate moon when I push open the window, leaning against the dressing table, my heart full of hatred. Look at the goose feather snow falling. Chang'e is deeply closed in the Guanghan Palace. Why is there no news since you left? I guess, you have a new love. I remember when we were as close as glue and paint. You shouldn't have abandoned me halfway. If you're coming or not, you should at least send a letter. It doesn't matter if we break off the relationship and go our separate ways. So that I don't have to worry about you.</p>

It was not the sound of waves in the sea or the sound of wind in the air, but the cacophony of sins. At this time, a group of warriors, holding heavy weapons, shouting, passed by the foot of Buzhou Mountain. (4)</p>

<p>In these times, the society is in recession, and many promising young people have been forced into becoming bad people by the harsh environment, especially when the will is weak among young girls. In "Boatman's Daughter," Xu Lai was originally a pure girl, rowing a boat with her old father in West Lake every day, living a virtuous life. However, the beautiful West Lake was also affected by the economic recession, and the number of tourists was becoming increasingly scarce. Like other debtors, they could not repay the boat rental fees every month. Under the fierce pressure of the boat owner, the fat Tan Zhihai, the old father was injured, and Xu Lai was also in the hands of the fat man. Finally, she became meat on the chopping block and became a goddess who sold her body. Every day, she endured whippings and hunger, enduring shame and humiliation, spending long years in sending off and welcoming guests. Is Xu Lai a goddess? No, she is just a weak woman who has been buried by the harsh environment!</p>

<p>Hollywood's film tycoons are very aware that the public's tastes are constantly changing. Therefore, they are also constantly looking for new things to stimulate the public, and the selection of actors is no exception. Hifilai in the past, and the protagonist of "Long Live Love" (Here's to Romance), which will be released at the Grand Light Theater, Nie Nuo Matini, is a good example.</p>
<p>These two singers were brought to the United States from Europe by the film's producer, Ge Xi Lasi. Hifilai has already succeeded in becoming the only great lover on the screen with his relaxed performance and the style of jazz music. Now, when Hifilai returned to France, they thought of Matini, who had already become famous on the stage. Matini's singing voice can be called second to none after Caruso. Lasi therefore treated him as a new thing to stimulate the movie audience.</p>
<p>After the film was completed, it caused a sensation when it was released in the United States, and the ideal of the film tycoon was realized again. In order to help Matini succeed, they also went to Europe to find several famous singers and dancers to co-star, creating a very perfect musical romance. The reason why it could cause a sensation was not accidental. In short, Matini built a great achievement on the silver screen with a new archetype.</p>

<p>In a corner of Shanghai West, there is a tall and magnificent Western-style house, which is the residence of Sun Zhonggui, the compradore of the Huadeng Bank. This Sun compradore obtained the position of compradore of the Huadeng Bank with a large amount of cash obtained from rent as a guarantee. However, his power is so great that it is truly red-hot.</p>
<p>His neighbor Zhao Dexiong is the general manager of the Zhenxing Yarn Factory and also a hero in the business world. He and Sun Zhonggui have a good relationship through marriage. Later, Dexiong's yarn factory suffered from foreign invasion, and its business plummeted. Although Dexiong struggled hard, he could not reverse the crisis. He had to discuss with Sun Zhonggui to mortgage the factory building to Huadeng Bank and borrow foreign capital to save the situation. As for the harsh contract conditions, although Dexiong had a marriage relationship with him, Zhonggui, because of the great interest involved, did not care. Not only that, Zhonggui also had sinister plans and secretly planned to seize his yarn factory.</p>
<p>The above story is only a small part of the dark side of the current society described in the giant sound production "Heroes of the Hour" by Yihua. However, we can use this to understand what kind of "situation" it is now. In fact, it is not only a snobbish "situation," a "situation" of the survival of the fittest," but also a treacherous "situation" full of selfishness and profit-seeking. As for these, the "Heroes of the Hour" will tell you in more detail, so you can understand the crimes of society and the treachery of people's hearts, as well as the crisis of the status of China's commercial and industrial industries in this play.</p>

<h3 id="e203">A Brief Overview of the Construction of the Nanjing Martyrs' Cemetery by Fu Ji Construction Company <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The Martyrs' Cemetery includes the main gate, surrounding walls, memorial archway, memorial hall, memorial tower, and three cemetery plots.</p>
<p>This project was funded by the Central Party Headquarters in memory of the fallen heroes and was overseen by Committee Member Chen Guofu and others. It is located at the foot of Zhongshan Mountain in Linggu Temple, east of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum, in a quiet and scenic area. Construction began in March of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and was fully completed in May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). The commencement of construction was slightly delayed due to the architect's careful consideration of the model to make it lifelike and antique. Now that this solemn and magnificent project has been completed, the construction process is described in detail below.</p>
<p>II. Various Projects</p>
<p>A. Memorial Tower</p>
<p>The tower is octagonal, with nine stories, reaching a height of 200 English feet from the platform to the spire. A steel-reinforced concrete spiral staircase is located in the center, providing direct access to the ninth floor. Each floor has a surrounding veranda, enclosed by Su stone railings carved from single pieces, a very labor-intensive process. The interior beams and edge beams of each floor are painted with colored cement, which is an innovative alternative to the traditional painted decorations of Beijing. Ordinary paintings inevitably fade over time, but colored cement remains permanently unchanged; however, the initial mixing process was quite complex, requiring dozens of experiments before it was successfully completed. The proportion of yellow sand and cement to be mixed depends on the various colors; otherwise, cracks and color differences will inevitably appear after drying.</p>
<p>After determining the location, the excavation of the foundation began. The depth was required to be excavated according to the drawings until a large stone was found, but the excavation reached 14 feet deep without finding a whole stone. The excavation continued to 18 and a half feet, but the same result persisted, although the soil quality seemed to have been partially petrified and was very hard. After a detailed investigation of the slope of the rock strata by the engineer, it was determined that it was unknown where the rock layer could be found. A load-bearing test was conducted, and each square foot was able to carry more than four and a half tons, with no sinking even after a week. The engineer was satisfied, and this first step was completed. The concrete mixing was done by machine from the foundation to the top. The large platform around the base of the tower, with a diameter of 100 feet, is also octagonal; all paved with Su stone slabs, with steel-reinforced concrete underneath. The joints between the platform stone slabs and the concrete are fully filled with ice slurry, surrounded by Su stone railings; and there are four steps. In the center of the front, an extremely large plinth stone is inlaid; the Party emblem is carved on the top, and landscapes are engraved on the bottom, with three peaks representing the Three Principles of the People; and water representing freedom and equality. The engraving is incredibly detailed. All stone materials, whether made into smooth surfaces or railings, if any minor flaws or unevenness were found, our factory spared no expense and no effort to discard and redo them to ensure perfection; however, the size and number of pieces previously ordered were fixed, and if any were not suitable, a new order was inevitable; and extending the time was unavoidable.</p>
<p>The other roofs are covered with green Guangdong glazed tiles. The tiles were custom-made, and those with bright colors and no spots were selected for use to ensure uniform color. The top of the tower is made of cast iron, with the outside electroplated with real gold. The lightning rod at the top of the tower is made of pure purple copper in a three-pointed style, and eleven No. 16 wires are connected to the ground, with a two-square-foot purple copper plate connected to the other end of the lightning wire underground.</p>
<p>On the four large steles on the bottom floor of the tower are written the four characters "Jing Zhong Bao Guo" (Serve the Country Faithfully) in the handwriting of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: the seven characters "Martyrs' Memorial Tower" on the horizontal plaque on the front are also in the handwriting of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; showing his sincere love and respect for the loyal souls! Except for the lower floor, the remaining eight floors are inlaid with four stone tablets each, fully engraved with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's opening speech at Whampoa Military Academy, farewell speech, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's preface to the Whampoa alumni roster, and posthumous list, all in the handwriting of modern celebrities.</p>
<p>The four large doors on the lower floor are framed with angle iron, covered with a whole piece of one-centimeter copper skin on the outside, and nailed with one-inch and six-minute semicircular copper nails.</p>
<p>B. Memorial Hall</p>
<p>Located in front of the tower, about 500 feet away, also in front of the old site of Zhi Gong Pagoda.</p>
<p>The hall is 136 feet and 6 inches long and 64 feet and 8 inches wide, with a long corridor around it, and the hall is in the style of a palace. The two-story roof is also covered with Guangdong glazed tiles, with painted beams and carved rafters; all imitating ancient palaces. The only difference is the distinction between wooden and cement beams and pillars. The completion date of the hall was nine months before the memorial tower. The interior materials and flat roof are the same as the memorial tower, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>C. Memorial Hall</p>
<p>Formerly known as the Beamless Hall, later renamed the Immeasurable Hall, now named the Martyrs' Memorial Hall for Loyal Souls. It was originally a renovated old building, destroyed in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War. From its initial construction to the present, it has a history of more than 500 years. The committee, in order to preserve historical sites, specially renovated the hall and renamed it the Martyrs' Memorial Hall for Loyal Souls. The hall is 210 feet long and over 190 feet wide. Most of the front was already destroyed, and the roof was completely ruined; it has now been restored to its original appearance, solemn and magnificent; unparalleled. It is divided into three major circles, with the largest in the middle. All are made of ancient city bricks side-laid with one-to-two cement, covered with two-and-a-half-inch steel-reinforced concrete to connect them into one piece, and then a large beam is added every thirteen feet. The lower tunnel ring form: the upper follows the slope of the roof, the middle ring is about fifty feet high and more than forty feet wide, with no pillar support in the middle, hence the former name Beamless Hall. The roof tiles are also in the old style, covered with tiles sixteen feet long, seven feet wide, and six minutes thick, and the bottom tiles are the same length and thickness, fourteen feet wide, all black, custom-made in Suzhou. The floor is paved with twenty-foot square Beijing bricks, also custom-made in Suzhou. The windows and doors are cast from raw and cooked iron, sprayed with antique bronze color, using pure copper powder mixed with color, sprayed hot by machine; which can be maintained permanently. The walls inside and outside are plastered with lime, which cannot show the ancient bricks, so the old plaster was completely brushed off, and then the seams were filled with cement, so that the thickness of the ancient bricks can be shown. The lower half of the inner walls are inlaid with bluestone, fully engraved with the names of the martyrs.</p>
<p>D. Cemetery</p>
<p>The cemetery is divided into three parts: left, right, and center. The center is the largest, a circle with a radius of 192 feet, with a larger half circle and a smaller half circle added, the whole cemetery resembles a lotus flower. It was very difficult and time-consuming to measure and draw the lines: because the ground was full of weeds and trees. Once the location was determined, the excavation of the wall foundation began, and the standard was determined according to the height of the terrain; after the soil was excavated, lime and three-in-one soil in proportions of one, three, six, cement, etc. were laid. The wall surface project is made of pre-cast ice mud boards, with lengths of three, five, etc., and a thickness of four inches and a height of one foot. Each layer is built (the same on the back) with bricks inlaid in the middle, and then the second layer is built until the top, the construction method is the same. After the whole wall is built, the third step is carried out, and the inner and outer walls are cut into stone patterns, which can be called artificial stone. After the cemetery was completed, the remains of the martyrs since the Northern Expedition were buried in it.</p>
<p>E. Memorial Archway</p>
<p>Made of five tiers with six cement piers. The lower half is inlaid with carved Su stone, and the upper part is all artificial stone. When compacting the cement, one, two, and fine sand must be attached to the side of the formwork for several inches until the top is the same. The brackets are pre-cast, cut into artificial stone, and then placed. The top is also Guangdong glazed tiles.</p>
<p>F. Main Gate and Surrounding Walls</p>
<p>The main gate is a tunnel gate, the ground is fully paved with Su stone slabs, and a Su stone base. Next to it is a surrounding wall with a total length of more than 300 feet, with round doors at both ends. The east door has the plaque "Zhao Lie" (Showing Loyalty), and the west door has the plaque "Yang Zhong" (Promoting Loyalty). The whole wall is pink cement, and the top of the wall is covered with colored glazed tiles. The base is half Su stone and half starting stone. The materials and Guangdong tiles are the same as the memorial hall: I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>III. Conclusion</p>
<p>For all the above projects, our factory has spared no expense and strived for perfection; if there is any slight impropriety, we will find a way to replace or redo it. Because the Central Government sincerely commemorates the burial place of loyal souls; our factory is also a member of the people, and we should understand the Central Government's supreme intention to comfort the heroic souls of the martyrs; and we dare not act rashly. Now that the great work has been completed, the construction process is described in detail on the right.</p>

<p>— Geng Longgen</p>
<p>The United States government has always attached great importance to domestic construction; just looking at the development of the construction industry in the United States, which ranks first in the world, one can imagine that the United States government, on the one hand, spends huge amounts of money to build buildings that have an impact on society, and on the other hand, does its best to help and encourage people to build. Since the Democratic Party came to power, it has made even greater efforts for this policy. The most noteworthy thing is the two things done last summer—organizing a Federal Building Management Office and announcing the revised New Building Regulations.</p>
<p>The work of the Federal Building Management Office is to implement the will of the New Building Regulations, and to provide people with full economic and technical assistance when building houses. The administrator is Mr. Moffett J.S. Moffett. The office has been established for one year and has achieved considerable results. (According to reports, Mr. Moffett is a confidant of President Roosevelt; in early summer of this year, he was entrusted by President Roosevelt to come to Shanghai to conduct an informal investigation of the current situation of Chinese silver and the construction industry.)</p>
<p>The Federal Building Management Office not only helps people build new houses, but also helps with the repair and renovation of old houses. When the office was founded, administrator Moffett told reporters: There are 13 million houses in the United States that need repair, and 3 million houses that need minor repair. We hope to find ways to help these homeowners borrow money from their local financial institutions in the near future to improve their houses and make them safe and comfortable to live in.</p>
<p>The Federal Building Management Office does not directly lend money to the people. The Federal Building Management Office only helps the people contact many financial institutions to establish construction mortgage loans, and tries to protect the lenders' money.</p>
<p>Because of the different uses, this type of construction mortgage loan is divided into two types: one is for those who build new houses, and the other is for those who repair or renovate old houses. The amount of loans for building new houses can be borrowed up to 16,000 yuan, and the amount for repairing old houses ranges from 100 yuan to 2,000 yuan. The collateral is the house and real estate for which the loan is sought. Unless it violates national laws, there is no need for a guarantor. The interest rate is mostly 5%, but it may increase to 6% due to local conditions, plus an insurance fee of half a percent or one percent. The repayment method is in installments, and the repayment period can be as long as 20 years.</p>
<p>The method of borrowing money is quite easy. The borrower first asks an architect to estimate the amount of money needed, and then takes this estimate to a financial institution that establishes or manages this type of loan in the local area to request a loan. If this estimate is reviewed and approved, the required money can be borrowed. The procedure is simple, without any bureaucratic red tape.</p>
<p>Repayment by monthly installments is the most common. Each time the money is repaid, in addition to the principal and interest, an insurance fee of half a percent or one percent must be paid. The lender insures the borrower's house on their behalf. In the event of an accident in the borrower's house, the borrower can get compensation from the insurance company, and the lender can avoid losses.</p>
<p>If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can request the Federal Building Management Office to use the power of the state to order the borrower to repay.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Federal Building Management Office and the promulgation of the revised New Building Regulations last year, the businesses of architects, material merchants, etc. that are directly related to construction have made a lot of progress.</p>
<p>There are also several commercial banks in our country that have established construction loans. I hope the government can help popularize this type of business.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Gate and Fence of a Residence (Part 2) <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Hengyou Pan, translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>(Continued from the Japanese supplement on page 10 of this newspaper on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Judging from today's social conditions or architectural styles, a somewhat open garden is more necessary than the non-open gardens of the past. If it is only to clearly separate the outside and the inside, or to prevent children and domestic animals from recklessly entering and leaving, then it can be said to be perfect. However, this hope may be too demanding. Here, for the design of the fence, firstly, the combination of appearance and practicality is very important.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is important to maintain harmony with the architecture and garden. For example, colored tiles, mudstone, and thatched Western-style buildings are completely incompatible with pure Japanese-style canopy doors or boat-board fences. Similarly, no matter how strong pure Japanese-style shoin-zukuri or teahouse-zukuri is, it is also discordant and unbalanced to use heavy and uninteresting brickwork or concrete construction. Also, in a larger sense, it is better for solemn buildings to be low and subdued, similarly, it is not good for tall buildings to be too low, as if they are sinking.</p>
<p>As for the choice of materials, it must also be carefully considered. There are many materials used for gates and fences in general residences, such as concrete, brick, iron, wood, and trees, etc., but these materials each have their own advantages and disadvantages depending on their location, architecture, garden, and economic conditions, so it is impossible to determine which is the best. However, in general, the materials for gates and fences must meet the necessary conditions. That is, they are economical, durable, and must have a beautiful appearance. From this point of view, ordinary hedges are the most ideal material. Building hedges is relatively cheap, the style is well-organized, they are durable, and they are more harmonious with any architecture and garden, and they have four seasons of changes, which other materials cannot match.</p>
<p>However, other materials also have their uses and their advantages, and to some extent, their shortcomings can be compensated for, so the most economical and closest one should be sought in the local area.</p>
