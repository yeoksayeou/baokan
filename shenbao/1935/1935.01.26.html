<p>日軍侵察行動</p>
<p>（倫敦）　泰晤士報發表論文、將日本廣田外相關於對華政策所發表之宣言、與中國察哈爾省境内新近事變作一比較、</p>
<p>謂外國對於日本所作和平宣言、不無懹疑之處、此蓋理所固然、日本政府未可以爲異也、「察哈爾省新近事變、係「滿洲國」曁其主人翁卽日本與中國之界務爭執、在問題本身、原無重要關係、惟廣田外相甫於日前聲言、以善意對待中國、今言猶在耳、而察哈爾事變卽已發作、可見日本軍人在軍事上所認爲適宜之行動、無不盡情爲之、至於政治觀念則非所顧及、而日本外交家亦無由加以阻止也、本報駐東京訪員以爲察哈爾事變、係「滿洲」國境内日本陸軍自由行動所致、並謂古時羅馬凱撤大帝及其軍隊在戈爾（卽今日法國）境内自由行動、不受節制、實與現代日本軍隊所爲相輝映、而近年來遠東種種事態、亦可於此獲得正確之解釋、要之、日本外務省一日不能諷令該國軍人務當與該國政府所宣佈之政策相呼應、則外務省發言人之和平宣言、卽一日不能取獲外國之信仰、此毫無足異者也」云云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>本月二十日以後。察東各地。突傅日僞軍進攻。步騎縱横。機彈轟擲。現難未得詳細之報告。確實之統計。然日僞軍之無端啟釁。則爲事實。不意東京日日新聞等日文報紙。記述此事。稱爲我國軍隊侵入熱邊。並謂日軍此舉爲防禦自守。今日日外務省根據關東軍報告。發訓電於駐外各使。宣傳此事。亦諉責任於中國軍隊。果持此種論調。以應付此事。則非但九一八以來中日間種種問題。不易解决。卽國際間一切正義。亦將無從維持矣。</p>
<p>溯自前年張家口事變以還。我國政府卽盡量維持和平。對日外交力持大事化小小事化無之宗旨。當爲舉世所共知。卽以察東而論。事實上匪特與日入所傳相異。且察東方面。自劉桂棠部流散。張允榮部西移商都後。我國並未駐軍。何來擾熱邊之事。此其情勢。日本當局。當亦明瞭。豈有極端注意遠東和平關係之東報而不知之。此爲我國人所首應聲明者也。</p>
<p>日本國内。近來對外宣傳及外交動向。頗有漸趨正軌。回復常態之趨勢。其對美力示和好。對蘇力持鄭重。對英亦圖諒解。對華態度。雖未完全明瞭。然亦似有和平傾向。東亞和平關係。一時或有重樹之可能。於此時期。與察東宋軍。縱有誤會。亦應以外交方式。磋商解决。今乃一方外交當局宣言親善。一方軍人自由行動。則非特今後欲親善而無從親善。卽以往之所努力。不亦將付諸流水乎。此又爲日本有識者所深惜者也。</p>
<p>當去年年底海軍軍縮預備會議僵化之際。國際風雲。一時呈露險象。然自本月初旬法意諒解成立。美國加入國際法庭。薩爾投票結果。世界和平重現之空氣。又復濃厚。於是英美日之海軍縮小問題。亦將受和平雾圍之影響。最近期内。不致發生海軍建艦競賽之局。然而中日關係。實爲遠東問題重要之關鍵。設使不得適當之處置。小之足以阻礙两國和平之進行。大則足以貽累世界和平之局勢。是故我國隱忍持重。無非顧全國際關係。維持世界和平之責任耳。日本於此。當平心靜氣以研究此事。而不容飾詞自欺也。况察東一帶。原甚和平。近經幾度轟炸。我猶鎭靜。其是非已甚明白。故茲事之不應擴大。日外交界已自知之。卽駐平日武官。亦以爲不致釀成巨變。則問題之前程如何。端在日本之善自處置而已。</p>
<p>我國已盡力於和平矣。且不惜爲和平而出巨大之代價矣。假使猶不能獲得和平之諒解。則責任所在。亦知所以自全之道。現時中國之經濟軍事。誠不免後人一着。然人民之忠誠爲國。亦未必後於先進諸國。日本與我國文字相同。歷史文化關係頗深。當知我國民族。决非自惰之民族。設使日本而眞欲保持遠東和平者。幸勿以武力爲萬能而不顧一切也。</p>

<p>徐道鄰</p>
<p>丨中日關係的檢討丨</p>
<p>一　引言丨中日間的僵局</p>
<p>世上論述中日問題的論文’已經很多，就是中日两國政治家及學者所發表的意見，不論專門的或一般的，也已經不少。但我敢斷言一句，两國公私各方對於中日問題的見解，眞能從國家終極的利害上打算，不爲感情或客氣所驅使，或一時錯誤所蒙蔽的，實在太少。我們至少可以說，對於問題正面的認識，實在太不够。國際間許多悲劇，都是起因於一時毫釐之差，致釀成萬刦不復之禍。爲打開中日两國徬徨的僵局，免使愈走愈趨絕路，也爲確奠東亞和平，消弭世界戰機起見，對於中日問題，實在有作一番忠實的檢討，無避忌無隱諱的下一番坦白的批判之必要。</p>
<p>我不是一個研究國際政治的專家，本文之作，完全在根據常識和事實，而作一種純客觀的眞實事理的指陳，以供中日雙方的反省。凡是一般政家舉者所已經論到的，我無須贅言，但一般所忽略或有所避忌而不言的，此文將傾量盡述而無所隱飾，知我罪我，聽諸讀者。</p>
<p>首先我敢說，一般有理解的中國人，都知道日本人終究不能作我們的敵人，我們中國亦究竟須有與日本携手之必要。這是就世界大勢和中日两國的過去現在與將來（如果不是同歸於盡的話）澈底打算的結論，我想日本人士中間懷抱同樣的見解的，當亦不在少數。但是至今爲止，不但沒有打開僵局，以更新两國關係的徵象，而且也找不到一點曙光，只是苟且遷延，得過且過，任令自然變化。人類已進步到了二十世紀，還不能直認事實，而却是遮遮掩掩的缺乏勇氣與眞誠，眞令人大惑不解。</p>
<p>二　就中國立塲說明僵局延長之利害</p>
<p>就中國方面說，現在支配中國政治的是中國國民黨。國民黨應該崇信中山先生的遺敎，是沒有疑義的。中山先生曾經說「如果東亞沒有日本，中國早已被人瓜分或共管了」。他又說「從日本動員之日起，開到中國攻擊之日爲止，最多不過十天，中國假若和日本絕交，日本在十天以内，便可以亡中國。」（民族主義第五講）其他證明中日两國輔車相依，合則两利，敵則两敗的話，散見於各種講演文件的還很多。本來從世界大勢來看，如果中國從遠大的將來着想，中日两國便應該相互提携而沒有交惡到底的理由。現在雖然有許多國民，激於當前的仇恨，頗有願與日本偕亡的氣槪，但中國國民黨的當局，旣然自任以全國安危之重，便應該從大處着想，堂堂正正的有忠於國家利害的打算。我們固然知道中日問題主動完全在日本，當日本無意緩和時，中國無法單獨緩和，但依目前所標榜的「一面抵抗一面交涉」的政策，實在只足以表示當局的無辦法。現在更有一類人，懸想到俄日或美日開戰時，乃至第二次世界大戰發生時，中國將何以自處，因而有主張中國應絕對不參加戰爭且實行嚴守中立的。殊不知戰端一啓，中國决沒有守住中立到底的可能，最可能的立塲，大約將不積極的站在那一方，而是反對那一方面，或者可以說有那一方面强迫我們或破壞我們中立的時候，我們便不恤犧牲的反抗他。但這樣仍然是與加入戰圈無異，這樣不能保持中立而處於被逼參加的被動地位，於中國並沒有何種的利益，而且必陷於最悲慘的絕境。所以我說與其說嚴守中立的話，還不如說是準備犧牲參加戰爭，若要說是站在那一方來參戰，毌寗說是反抗那一方面之爲當。因此可知中國要在第二次世界大戰中守住中立，或希望於中取巧，得到什麽利益，就無異於痴人說夢。我以爲目前中國，只有盡力消弭戰機，纔是唯一可採之路。而欲消弭戰機，至少須將足爲引起戰機原因之一的中日問題，求得一個解决。中日問題解决了，世界局勢將爲之一變，俄美與日本間之戰爭或者可以不發生，即使還有俄日或美日戰爭，在中國也可以有淸淸楚楚的立塲，自由應付，而不受絲毫的牽掣。所以無論由中山先生的遺敎及國家永久利害上着想，或是爲因應現在國際間局勢着想，中國方面斷乎不應聽任中日僵局無期延長下去，而不謀解决之道。</p>

<p>再從日本方面說，自九一八以至於現在，自内田以至於廣田，自從侵佔東北四省，其後退出聯盟，乃至去年四月十七日强硬的聲明，以迄於最近，雖然中間一再有「增進及維持東亞和平」之口頭的標榜，但所作所爲，無不是增重東亞和平的危機，而且積極遂行其對華强硬之政策，始終沒有改變的跡象。我們固然知道日本旣然在三年以前向中國向世界投下如此驚人的一顆炸彈，現在已欲能不能的在某種理想之下，逕行直遂的走去，彼國的政治家及軍部，自有其對世界對中國的打算，或者其自身的計劃已很周詳，但我們局外靜觀，至少就日本對中國所取策略而言，可以直言日本的打算並不是算無遺策。論到日本對中國關係，我們必須將其對俄對美（與對英）之錯綜關係連帶並論，蓋在一方面，因爲日本欲遂行其大陸政策，與獨霸太平洋的理想，打倒勁敵，混一東亞，所以引起俄美的嫉視，在另一方面，日本當局所持以欺騙其國民者，謂如不取得滿蒙，無以解除日本國防安全之威脅，換言之，就是日本爲對俄對美備戰，所以必須經略滿蒙。我們現在也以純客觀的態度替日本打算一下，國際上無論在戰略政略上說，正面以外，當然應該算到側面和背面，側背方面如其有了對敵，這對敵的兵力如果運用得法，就可以當得過正面二倍三倍甚至十倍以上的效力，這世上無論任何政略家或戰略家所了然無疑的。現在日本如欲東向與美國啓釁，中國即在其背面，如欲北向與蘇俄開戰，中國即在其側面，所以日本如欲對美對俄備戰，如不消弭側背方面的顧慮，豈但沒有制勝的把握，直無開戰的可能。但消弭側背方面顧慮的方法，本來也有两途，一種是以力量絕對控制住這個鄰國，使無能爲患，一種是與這個處在側背方面的鄰國結成恊調關係。現在日本人旣不從恊調方面與中國提携，則日本的打算，顯然是採取以强力控制中國的辦法，然日本能否絕對達到控制中國的目的昵？而且以我們所見，中日两國旣已交惡到這般田地，只控制中國也還不是辦法，而必須在對美或對俄開戰以前澈底滅亡了中國，若日本不能如孫中山先生所說，十天以内滅亡了中國，則日本地位甚爲危險，因日本滅亡中國的時間，如要用三個月或半年的期間，則美或俄必不能坐待日本之從容對付中國，而將迫日本以速戰，然而我們就事實觀察，日本佔領東北，已有三年之久，不但東北義勇軍尙不能消滅，而瀋陽一縣的民間槍械，何嘗能如期繳淸？由此事實推斷，日本畢竟能否在最短期間，如十天以内，澈底的控制中國甚至滅亡中國呢？至於中山先生何以明言日本在十天以内可以亡中國？要知中山先生之言，是看破日本早具有十天内佔領中國要地之野心與其可能，故特加重其詞，以警惕國人，彼亦何嘗不明知日本只能於十天之内佔領中國重要交通地區，而不能滅亡中國四千五百萬方里之土地，與四萬八千萬之人民？吾人旣明此意，則可就種種之事實與情勢上觀察，日本有無澈底控制中國或滅亡中國之可能？</p>
<p>（一）就控制中國來說，日本當然要先以海軍力量封鎖中國的海岸，但中國現在尙處於次殖民地的地位，歐美各國對中國有錯綜的政治經濟的關係，尤其是英國的關係爲更切，豈止關涉一二國的利害而已。日本如欲如此做去，將不止與中國爲敵，不止與俄美爲敵，而且强迫英國以及全世界作敵人。控制中國海岸本來爲對俄或對美作戰之便利，但在主戰沒有開始以前，便擴大敵對範圍到全世界，是否爲有利之戰略？這是就海上說。</p>
<p>（二）在陸上方面，我們可信日本所積極打算中者，即爲造成第二第三的「滿洲國」，亦即一般所傳，將擴大侵佔範圍，以造成所謂「華北國」或「蒙古國」，但此是否爲日本力量所容許呢，先就經濟方面來說，日本自出兵滿洲以至造成「僞國」以來，所支出的軍費有多少的數額，這是世人所共知的，其國内財政上赤字數額的繼長增高，也是世人所共知的，現在如擴大侵佔範圍，須知經略華北决不如强佔東三省時可以唾手而得、一則當時事起無備、二則華北之民氣民力與人民知識程度，又與東三省久處日本勢力之下，精神上早受影響者不同，日本如眞欲在華北或蒙古造成其意想中之第二第三的傀儡組織，所消耗的兵力與支出的費用，視前必以倍計，而如内蒙一帶，遍野荒凉，旣鮮生產，毫無收入可言，强欲經略，倍多耗費，此就其直接經濟影響而言。在間接影響說，日本如必欲更進一步擴大侵略範圍，中國國民的抵貨運動，將非任何力量所能抑制，彼時日本在華是否尙有商業或其他產業可以立足，也就不難想像。再就軍事及所需兵力而言，先以「滿洲國」爲例，日本駐在「滿洲國」的軍隊，表面上說是五個師團，實際我們知道十萬人以上，有十萬以上的軍隊，至今尙不能確保所謂「滿洲國」境内的治安而時時要受義勇軍的威脅，然則日本如再欲造成與「滿洲國」同樣的第二第三僞組織，至少也須派出二十萬陸軍，纔能對付得過。日本常備兵額總計不過十七個師團，全數調來尙且不敷，國内與朝鮮治安的維持鎭懾，也還須相常的兵力，至此勢必徵調及於預備役及後備役。如此則日本就是與中國正式作戰；與中國正式作戰，就不是我上面所說，僅僅控制中國北部的範圍以内的事。這樣他就要以支戰塲作爲主戰塲，就要完全抛棄他的主目的敵。日本如出此下策，就不管自取敗亡。此種有意義的犧牲，將非中國之所畏，且無寗爲中國之所樂受而不辭。</p>
<p>（三）日本如以任何理由對中國正式用兵，中國的武力比不上日本，必將大受犧牲，這是中國人所不容諱言。但日本的困難，亦即在於此，中國正唯因爲沒有力量，即是其不可輕侮的力量所在。戰爭開始，在勢力相等的國家，以决戰爲戰事的終結，但在兵力絕對不相等的國家，如日本同中國作戰，即無所謂正式的决戰，非至日本能佔盡中國每一方里之土地，澈底消滅中國之時，不能作爲戰事的終結。两國開戰之際，本以佔領政治中心爲要着，但在對中國作戰，如以武力佔領了首都，制不了中國的死命。（因中國尙在革命未成時期，俟下面再詳論之）日本至多也不過能佔領到中國若干交通便利的都市與重要的海港，决不能佔盡四千五百萬方里中國全土。中國重要都市與海港全被佔領時，在中國誠然將陷於極度的困苦與犧牲，然日本亦何嘗能澈底消滅中國之存在？即就東北四省被佔爲例，在中國國家喪失此重要之領土，當然爲一極嚴重之損失，但以革命期内的國民政府的性質視之，一時的得喪幾無關係，且無寗謂塞翁失馬。蓋吾人曾聽到中國國民黨當局說：「收復東北，革命黨當然應負其責任，但失去東北，革命黨不負其責任。」作者不是國民黨黨員，對於此語，不欲斷言其是否爲國民黨自圓其說。事實上東北在九一八以前，僅名義歸屬於國民政府，而軍權政權財權，儼然獨立，至少可說非革命勢力範圍以内之地。不過從前是有名無實，而今則並喪其名，但表面雖屬淪亡，實際自東北被佔以後，東北軍隊反得因此而完全統一於中央，東北人心，亦澈底認識民族主義的意義，精神上更密切歸屬於統一的中國之下。就此一段的證明，可以知道日本若以繼續侵略蹙削中國疆土爲得計，其結果不過使中國踵行放棄歐洲退保亞陸時的土耳其的先例，縮短戰線，出死力以爭生存，彼時两國人民的生命犧牲，慘烈不堪預想，但兵連禍結，日本畢竟能否達到澈底消滅中國的目的呢？</p>
<p>由於上面幾點。可見日本無論爲對俄對美備戰，或爲遂行其五十年前傳統的大陸政策，而出於武力壓迫中國或侵略中國之計，在日本立塲上，决然爲犧牲極大而毫無把握的企圖。換言之，不諭控制中國，或消滅中國，皆爲不可能。至於國際上側目而視，以及日本内在的危機，我此文已不用贅說。日本國内現在也有不少有識之士，十分憂慮於日本之將來的，但以我所見，日本實在沒有非孤行到底不可的理由，如果撇開成見，認淸事實，要改弦更張，那就回頭是岸。</p>
<p>國際上大錯的鑄成，有主因也有副因，往往不止一方有錯誤而必是雙方均有其錯誤。我們綜觀自九一八前後以迄於今，不論中國方面或日本方面，均有其對大勢及對彼我認識之錯誤以及措置上的錯誤，這些錯誤有已成過去的，有繼續仍循着錯誤之路而還不斷製造新錯誤的，本文旣欲忠實的檢討中日關係，當然應將两方所有的錯誤，一一指出，而後可定應採取的解决途徑。（未完）</p>

<p>「五墩六家村，娘子養男人，」</p>
<p>「男人鬥紙牌，女人挑鹽賣，」</p>
<p>「五墩六家村，」是在海邊的一個村落，濱海居民，大都是把「曬鹽板」做正業，而把耕種當做副產品，曬鹽板，是先把海水濾成淸露，然後把那淸露盛於木製的鹽板之上，再把鹽板諸「墩」上，曬於陽光之下，經過相當的時期，便成我們日常調味的食鹽了；至於那邊的田畝，因爲接近海灘之故，土質旣不很肥饒，而且常有海水浸掩之虞，所以他們雖也一般的努力墾植，但收成總是有限，所以他們的生活，大都偏重於曬鹽的收入，耕種所獲，不過藉以貼補貼補而已，當然他們也希望歲收豐稔的。</p>
<p>曬鹽與耕田，當然都是勞苦的職業，一些了也偸暇不得的，而照中國普遍的習慣，大都是由男子們去獨當一面，女人不過處於佐理的地位，然而，在這「五墩六家村」的一個地方，恰是成了一個反比例，關於一切笨重的工作，都由女人去擔任，男人不過跟着伊們收拾一切零碎的輕易的雜務，因此附近居民，在怪異的眼光下給起了這樣两句諺語；丨「五墩六家村，娘子養男人」；再當工作閒暇之時，那裏的女人就挑了曬成的鹽，跑到客地去出售，那男人呢，反是在家裏合夥兒作那鬥紙牌做消遣，因此又有「女人把鹽賣，男人鬥紙牌」的諺語。</p>
<p>所以，那裏丨五墩六家村的女人，大都是粗黑，壯健，大脚，合手現代審美的條件。</p>
<p>這種生活，雖然是太畸形了的，但伊們的「自食其力」的毅力卓志，我們却終不能不給予相當的讚美，而認現代解放的女子所應該效法的呢。</p>

<p>— 朱㦻</p>
<p>蘇州是文物薈萃的好地方，除了溫柔得水樣的女子，書畫家中，也代出名人，替天堂般的蘇州，裝點出斯文氣象，近時蘇州的書畫集團，除了在南京展覽的正社以外，還有個「蘇州書畫社」。該社主持人物，像陳迦盦，吳待秋，顧墨彝，樊少雲，柳君然，張宜生諸先生，都是名震蘇滬的名畫師··這次各出精彩作品，到上海來舉行畫展，使這天寒歲暮的上海藝術界，添着一番錦簇花團的氣象眞不但是藝苑盛事，也是人們眼福。</p>
<p>蘇州書畫社這次到上海展覽，事先雖已籌備了好久，並且爲使蘇州人觀賞起見，在上月中旬已在蘇州舉行一次展覽會，開會的幾天，眞是觀者如潮，一致贊美，會中作品，竟訂去一半，於是主持的人，深覺這些些畫品，不敷支配。在閉會以後，各畫師都加工趕造，努力作畫，因裱工需時，而天雨霏　，一直綿綿不絕，直到最近天公方才轉晴，而諸畫師的作品，也都裝裱竣工，於是就定於念六日起，假座三馬路天藝社舉行展覽。</p>
<p>該社的展覽畫件，陳迦盦和柳君然两畫師的作品，陳列最多。迦盦先生的畫，名馳大江南北，運筆是那麽秀動，但所寫的花卉翎毛，却又形神俱足。這次出品，共計二十餘幅，花鳥山水，色色俱全；那一幅，籬下鷄雛，繁花滿架，織草如茵，幾球黃色雛鷄，粥粥覓食，彷彿離紙欲下，眞是寫生神手。</p>
<p>柳君然畫師是迦盦先生的入室弟子，運筆布局，俱已卓然成家，他的果品，在蘇州畫界，推爲第一妙筆，這次畫會中，柳君特趕繪四季菓品屏條两堂，桃李菱藕，紛然雜陳，不但形態酷肖，布局結構，更充滿神韻；至於「九秋」中堂等等，亦筆法娟秀精神奕奕。</p>
<p>吳待秋畫師的山水菓，久已馳譽燕幾，這次也興致勃發，畫了幾幅花果，筆調蒼老，彷彿缶老作品。更有一幅青綠山水，層巒聳翠，林木蓊鬰，布局是密密的，然而神韻悠然，眞所謂密而不悶的了。上首還題着一首古詩「青山隨客舟，一轉谿一曲；谿水淺復深，山痕斷還續。低樹礙行颿，叢蘆隱漁屋。烟水相與深，空明數里綠。扣舷和菱歌，擬入西谿宿；小泊傍危橋，驚鷗起洄洑。」神酣韻足，堪稱两美。</p>
<p>老晝師顧墨畦先生，是陸廉夫先生的入室弟子，人物山水，工細絕倫，書晝社在蘇州舉行展覽會時，顧先生特地晝了一幅八尺中堂「桃源問津圖；」山水烟樹，樓閣參差，點綴着黃髪垂髫，灼灼桃花，把桃源景物，悉收拾在尺幅裏面。顧先生以花甲遐龄，趕　這大幅晝品，竟致積勞成疾，可惜這幅陳列以後，就爲獅子林貝宅購去，這次晝展中，顧先生祇有一幅五尺中堂陳列咧。</p>
<p>此次展覽晝中，樊少雲的山水中堂，吳子鼎的人物，山水屏條，顧彥平的山水立軸，沈立之，范子明的山水堂屏，都是名作。我的朋友張宜生，是陳迦盦先生的弟子，近來又常從吳待秋問敎，他的山水，確已突飛猛晋，那幾幅尺頁，逼肖山谷麓台，可惜名士氣太重了，青衫潦倒，鬰鬰不得志，但他的晝品，確是有目共賞的。</p>
<p>畫會中還有两位青年晝家吳宜孫與陸一飛，宜孫的晝，山水翎毛，並皆擅長，用筆工細絕倫。陸一飛的四幅仕女，採菱，浣紗諸幅，晝筆娟媚，設色雅麗，那四首題詞，也不同凡俗</p>
<p>畏友程小青先生，這次也豪興勃發，特地晝了三幅小晝，列會陳列，那一幅梅花雙羽，一樹梅花，還是老師迦盦合作補上，越加生色不少；至於書聯方面，蕭退閣蔣吟秋蔣企範諸書家，也都有作品陳列，大有可觀。</p>

<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>普通用的大量電容器有二種，一種是紙質電容器，一種是電液電容器。在這二種中，後者雖易損壞，但是價格低廉，而且佔地甚小。故近來特别風行，舶來品收音機中的大量電容器，可以說完全是電液式者。但是電液電容器倘能使用合法，則亦甚耐用。其使用時應注意的幾點如下：</p>
<p>一，耐壓强度　每一電液電容器，皆有一規定的耐壓强度。使用時絕對不可超過，否則其内部絕緣物質卽被打穿而發生短路危險。倘使用時能較比數量减小，則較爲安全。在交流收音機濾波電路中的濾波電容器，其耐壓强度至少應爲其電源變壓器次級高壓的一·四倍·例如規定五百弗打之電液電容器，則次級壓至多不可過三百五十弗打。（三五０乘一·四爲四九０，約爲五００弗打。）</p>
<p>二，電液電容器有乾式及濕式二種。濕式者漏電較大，但是對於電路中偶然電壓昇高，則能耐受。後者則電壓一高，卽告損壞。故在電壓常有變動之處，應採用濕式電液電容器，則較爲安全。</p>
<p>三，電液電容器的二接綫頭·有正負之分。接綫時絕對不可錯誤，否則立卽損壞。</p>
<p>四，電液電容器名置不用後，其内部之絕緣物，卽逐漸消失。在復用前，應先在低電壓下使用數分鐘，則其失去之絕緣物，卽自能重復生成；使用時可無危險。</p>
<p>五，電液電容器不可置於高溫度之處，因高溫度有促短其壽命之虞。</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>電源變壓器的綫圈，一旦發生短路（Ｓbort　Ｃirciut）如果手頭沒有精密的電表，一時是很難測騐的，本文所叙述的方法，却不需專門的儀器，和繁複的手續，能在極短的時間内，替你找出綫圈短路的所在。</p>
<p>如圖，Ｔ爲電源變壓器Ｌ爲常用之電燈泡。測騐時，先將收音機内各眞空管完全取出，次將開關ＳＷ關上·此時細察電燈泡Ｌ如：</p>
<p>（一）毫無亮光　卽證明各次級綫圈均属完好，變壓器之設計，亦異常精良。</p>
<p>（二）發生紅光　卽證明低壓次級綫圈發生短路，或高壓次級綫圈，一小部份發生短路。（如發生極暗之光，此係普通變壓器所不可避免之各種損失丨如渦流損失（Ｅddycurrent　Ｌoss）等，並非次級綫圈發生短路，應注意。</p>
<p>（三）發生白光　卽證明高壓次級綫圈發生短路。</p>
<p>（四）時亮時暗　次級綫圈卽將發生短路</p>
<p>初級綫圈如發生短路，各次級綫圈，便立卽超越常數，察看甚易。各綫圈如發生斷綫或碰綫等情形，更不難以電壓表或聽筒串聯電池測騐之。本文爲節省篇幅計，茲從略。</p>

<p>— 吳子佩</p>
<p>閱九十八期ＫＭＫ君的「强力眞空管用作檢波的改良」一文能使失眞减低，音調平穩，足爲一般愛好者的借鏡。</p>
<p>强力管之放大係數極大，用作檢波，其音量不亞於普通之二管機；然其所耗之電力極大，如電池式之３３，其燈係電壓需２Ｖ·，電流需０·２６Ａ，共需０丨５２Ｗ，２５Ａ·之小型蓄電池·用至四十小時·卽須充電；而Ｂ電壓至少談４５Ｖ至９０Ｖ·，屏熱和簾柵熱共需１７·５Ｍ·Ａ·，市售之Ｂ電池，不足三安培·最多用二百小時，卽須另換新電池，每月之費用，比省電管約貴三倍；如用４２·或２Ａ５Ａ·電取自交流電·Ｂ電用乾電池，其每月所耗費的，須比省電管貴四倍·如全用交流電·每月之維持費較省，而裝置費用較貴，不甚合算。</p>
<p>總上以觀·用强力管作檢波，在效力上較省電管爲優，而每月之費用，亦甚可觀。</p>
<p>ＭＫＫ君之綫路，採用三四路，用活動電容器調節屏回路，無可疵議。不過，如改以哈脫萊式之接法，卽次級和屏回路相接，仍以變量電容器調節屏流，回授力可較平穩，而接綫比較便當，效力可靠。</p>
<p>簾柵熱之電阻在波長較短之電台，阻力宜較大，反之宜較小；能以變量電阻調節，可調節至最悅耳處；而聽筒或喇叭之两端，跨接一小容量之固定電容器，那末音質可改善不少。</p>
<p>用强力管或五熱管時，最宜注意一點：當屏回路未接通時，切勿把電源開啟，不然，簾柵熱受損，以後應用時，無形中已打了九折或八折。</p>
<p>前曾以２Ａ５，３３，５８，４２裝拆數次，確信效力不惡，故特提出，爲愛好者告。</p>

<p>— 馮偉樵</p>
<p>讀第九十八期本刋所載阿鳳君之保護膜片法，不禁使我也想起對於保護膜片的妥善方法，聽筒旣爲普通收音機必要之品，對於膜片的保護得宜，極關重要。</p>
<p>如新購的聽筒，同時在無綫電材料行或五金舖，購雲母片（俗稱千層紙）一方，可分作二片，價値不過銅元五六枚，用雲母片剪成同膜片般大小，四週用膠水黏成一片，俟腿水乾後，同旋入聽筒蓋内，這樣非但永久保證膜片不會生銹潰污，且能增加傳音効力，讀者不妨一試。</p>
<p>若發現膜片旣已生銹，則先將所生的銹，用小刀或砂皮細細刮去後，再用棉花蘸火酒揩淸，乾燥後用鉛筆塗沒生銹處，可免不再生銹。</p>
<h3 id="c154">檢波的種種 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>發射機所發射的電波她的週率極高，爲人耳所不能聽聞，故必須用檢波器使整流成爲成音週率（Ａudio　ｆrequency）今市上所用的檢波器，可分二種，一爲礦石檢波，一爲眞空管檢波·礦石檢波無選擇性，且無放大能力，亦其惟一的缺點，但因其裝置之便宜，代價之輕賤，故人亦樂用之，眞空管檢波用者較多，因之種類亦繁，約分五種，卽柵漏式檢波（Ｇrid　leak　and　Condenser　detcctor),丙電壓檢波（Ｇridbias　detector）或稱屏檢波，半波檢波（Half　Wave　detector),全波檢波(Full　Wave　detector)，推挽式檢波或乙類檢波（Ｐusb　Pull　detector　or　class　B　detector)等是也，茲特五種檢波述之如下：</p>
<p>（一）柵極檢波丨丨此式檢波爲一只高電阻與一只電容器合組而成，見圖一所示，Ｒ爲二兆歐姆高阻力，Ｃ爲·０００二五兆分法拉特固定電容器，牠的作用，Ｒ是使柵極上能得相當的負電壓，Ｃ則使高週波容易經過而至柵極，ＲＦＣ則阻止高週流入成音週率部份，Ｃ爲傍路電容器容量爲·０００二五兆分法拉特，其功用能使高週波流回原處，柵漏式檢波在現市上，用者最多，因其靈敏度極佳，較其他各式檢波，有過之無不及，選擇性亦佳，惟屏電壓不宜過高，因柵極上所感受的電壓有限制，過大則發音時易失眞（distortion），過小將不起振盪，并且在諧振點以後，揚聲器或聽筒中，將發生一種最使人們厭惡的「嘯嘯」聲，自己聽得尙無妨，旁近的收音機亦被擾及，故此式檢波在歐美各國已在禁止之例</p>
<p>（二）屏極檢波丨丨用丙電壓檢波者，其柵極所應得之電壓，通常須視屏極所用之電壓而定，例如以３０號眞空管作屏極檢波，設其乙電壓用九十弗打，則丙電宜用四個半弗打，乙電壓如爲一百三十五弗打，則丙電亦需增至九弗打。此類檢波其靈敏度當較柵漏式檢波爲遜，然振盪當較平穩，調節亦覺簡易，故直流電收音機除外差式或多管調整射電週率放大外，不常用之。</p>
<p>交流機中，用此式檢波者，最爲普遍。其電源并不用丙電池而以代丙電器代之。此代丙電器爲一只電阻與一只固定電容器合組而成，有陰極的眞空管，就接在陰極上，如圖二所示Ｒ爲耗阻器，Ｃ爲固定電容器，沒有陰極的眞空管，如４７等號，則接在中心分線上，但用作檢波者不常見之，蓋容易引起交流聲</p>
<p>（三）半波檢波，圖三所示爲半波檢波線路，Ｖ爲雙屏三極管，如５５，７５，８５，２Ａ６，６Ａ６等眞空管，或有用雙屏五極管作半波檢波者（如２Ｂ７，６Ｂ７等），雙屏部份所以能檢波，完全賴其有單向性的理由，故能整流電波此式檢波在外差式收音機中每用作第二級檢波，而另以三極部份作放大或自動音量控制</p>

<p>— 劍琴</p>
<p>▲聽筒揷座　　葦薇</p>
<p>有時我們爲了檢查檢波級或某一級低週率放大級的綫路是否完好，或者爲了顧全收音的道德起見，要在直流的多管機上用聽筒來試聽，可是接綫拆綫是非常麻煩的，要避去這種麻煩很便利，我們可以用一舊眞空管底座，旁邊接二隻接綫柱，這二個接綫柱是預備接聽筒脚的，接綫如出甲圖所示，這是一個很便利的聽筒揷座，使用時，只要把它揷入任何一級低週率放大管的管座中，（原有的放大管當然是拔去的）換言之，就是用這個揷座來代替原有的放大管，不過祗不適用於代替推挽式放大管。</p>
<p>▲短波揷入式綫圈管</p>
<p>我們時常爲了經濟的關係，短波揷入式的綫圈管，大都利用舊的眞空管底座，但是在綫圈圈數多的時候，地位的覺太狹，我們總想把管座引長出去，普通大都用厚紙圈在管座中，可是這樣做，就有高低不平之弊，尙不是良法，最好使底座和厚紙同樣高低，如乙圖所示，先在管座中圈厚紙一層，作爲内層，然後在内層外面再糊一層厚紙，（如有現成電池外壳，其圓周適與管座相等，那末就可套在内層上）這樣厚紙和膠木底座就沒有高低不平的弊了，而就成了一個價廉物美的揷入綫圈管。</p>
<p>▲高週率阻流圈</p>
<p>我相信，玩無綫電的人，大槪都知道電容器相串聯其容量反减少，同理我們可以應用到高阻圈的繞法，所以售品都是採用分段繞法，因爲這樣可以减少電容量，我們自己繞製高阻圈，也應照這樣繞法，以便得較高的効率，爲便利起見，可以用二個洋綫木軸併合，如圖丙所示，在這上面用三十六號漆包綫，每軸約繞五百圈光景，如果要更精細的話，那末可以把每個木軸再用木質或滲透過臘的厚紙隔開，再分成二段，注意繞時不必求整齊，儘可亂繞，因爲這樣可以减少綫圈間的分佈電容量，當你把它接在綫路中，你會知道，這個高阻圈比普通的効力來得高妙。</p>
<p>▲短波的啞點</p>
<p>在短波的收音機中，有時發現啞點（ＤeadSpots),這大槪是交連得太緊的緣故，要免去這種啞點，我們可以在揷入綫圈的管座上，用十八號漆包綫繞三圈，一頭不接，一頭接天綫，這樣就等於接了一隻天綫的補償電容器，不過柵極綫圈應該繞在揷入管的下部，而且三個綫圈的方向應一致，否則是沒有効的。</p>

<h3 id="c216">關於典型與英雄 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>在文學作品裏，主人公缺少了典型的時候，常常變成了空想的人物，而且是種夢幻般的浮雕；在自然主義和現實主義作家的作品裏，主人公必須地合於實際的人物，而綜合地製作出現實社會的活動人物之典型。</p>
<p>關於典型，並不是抽象的主人公的性格之重現，而是具體的通過作家進步的世界觀之活的人間。常常地有很多作家，忠實於現世界的一切事物，雖然能細縷的述出類似的較典型的人物，可是這些人物常常地桎梏於平凡的生涯之中，而缺少了勇敢的英雄性。</p>
<p>在柴霍甫的作品裏，有綜合的尼古拉時代憂鬱的主人公，醫生，或孩子，在西萬斯提的唐·吉訶德裏有幽默的誇大的騎士，在屠格𣵀夫的羅亭裏，有嘴頭油滑而萬事有阻的羅亭，這些典型，我相信的確很具體地表現了當時社會的活的人間，可是這些人間之在文學作品裏的作用上講，是無甚大的功用的。同時在莎士比亞的四大悲劇里，這些典型的主人公，具體地表現出來了貴族階級沒落的運命，籠統地說，前者都是消極的典型，而後者却帶着極積性的；至於浪漫主義作家的作品裏之主人公，并不是典型，是幻想；舉個最顯明的例說吧；英國的王爾德的道連格雷晝像裏的道連格雷，就是最好的例子。</p>
<p>在過去的文學作品裏以及現在的各作家的作品裏，我相信，雖然已經認淸了主人公的現實性，不把現實主義者看成了一面鏡子，而尤其對典型與以了重視；可是在缺點方面還犯了圖式的公式的規律；以及平凡而非英雄。</p>
<p>水門汀作者格拉特考夫的報告裏說：「作爲我們作品裏的缺點丨丨在指導的地方，缺少了創造使人感動，呼呌的人間的典型的形像。」法捷耶夫也說「在現代的主人公的指寫上，有很多還未從圖式主義裏解放出來，而缺少了在典型的諸事情上的典型的諸性格。」</p>
<p>的確在圖式主義上的錯誤，我能憶起小林多喜二的沼尻村，這本小說與其說是小說，毌寗說是鐡般的公式，把主人公的性格，變成了圖式的鑄模裏鑄出的人物，這種描寫和制作，或許造成了英雄的雾圍氣，但並不是現實的活的人間了。要得到眞的人間典型的性格，須從活着的生活裏出發，才能求得，决議書籍不能以與眞的性格，祇能與創造其生活的模造，但這並不是眞的藝術了。</p>
<p>我們必須把現時代的進步的人物，作爲研究感想的對象，而且必須理解他們靠着什麽而活在人間，如何的欣喜，空想着什麽？如何地愛戀，悲哀什麽，爲什麽而鬥爭，而如何地工作，而且他們持有了怎樣的思想樣式等等事件不可！把這些形象釀醇至極度的濃厚，使他們輝耀起來，把他們塑成了我們時代的先進的思想之槓桿。</p>
<p>照着上面的寫法，我相信這個被描寫出來的人物，絕對是典型的，而且是一種時代的英雄。此地所謂英雄，不是超時代的英雄，而是靠着羣衆的力量而鑄就的「平凡的英雄」（這話也許有語病。）舉個實際的例來說吧！像「鐡流」裏的郭如鶴，「潰滅」裏的鐵奮生，「開拓了的處女地」裏的達衛道夫等，卽是屬於是類的英雄。我們知道這些英雄，并不是超歷史的人物，或者是靠着他個人的力量打開天地的人物，而是灌入了羣衆的意志才發揮其個人的能力之人物；錄一段綏拉菲莫維支對於郭如鶴的分析吧：</p>
<p>「郭如鶴是英雄，也不是英雄，因爲如果羣衆不把他作成自己的領袖，如果羣衆不注入他以主意，那麽郭如鶴是一個最平常的人。但，同時他也是個英雄，是因爲羣衆不但注入他以主意，而且追隨着他；服從他好像服從領袖一樣。」</p>
<p>看這一段的說明，則很顯明地能瞭解了我所說的英雄底眞面目。像這樣的英雄，不但增進了作品的積極性和眞實性，而且不致於發生了盲目的曖昧的行爲。自誇爲英雄的唐·吉訶德之能與風車相戰的那種類型，是不致於再現於今日的文學裏了。並且以爲具有積極性的公式證明出來的人物，也許不會再出現其呆板的姿態了吧！</p>
<h3 id="c217">偷兒（下） <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>有一天河水漲了時候，十九歲的馬家駒在河邊撒下他底小網，就含着捲烟，跟在「埗頭」洗衣服的四十多歲的蘭香嬸談着天。照平常一樣，鄕長馬大爺底十四歲的獨生子八官從大口袋裏不住地掏出小石子，在河邊巡迴着，看定撒網的地方就把石子抛下去。爲了這，馬家駒和他底同伴常常做出打架的姿勢恐嚇他的。</p>
<p>「擲中我底腦袋可不是玩的。自己又不識水性，在海龍王面前······當心，我告訴你底爸爸去。」蹲在水邊石階上洗衣的蘭香嬸仰起頭警告着。</p>
<p>「我在練眼力呢；將來還要換過用槍彈的。······死了不要緊，我做了大官的時候，給你建個牌坊就是。」八官嘻笑着，又向女人投了一塊石頭。</p>
<p>馬家駒突然兇惡地張開手臂，拾起一塊青磚，追逐那個瘦弱的小猴子。像犯神擺佈好了圈套，有意使那打漁的小伙子永遠陷入悲苦的命運裏一樣，八官飛似地跑着，跑得很遠，一下子跌進水裏面去了······</p>
<p>馬家駒吃驚地呌起來，不曉得怎樣做才對，後來等他下了决心跳進水裏，要把他救起來的時候，已經是太遲了。他負上了可怕的罪名·被判了七年徒刑。而蘭香嬸因爲說了一句老實話來證明他底寃枉，面上得了一塊青紫的指印，還要自己掏錢出來醫眼睛。</p>
<p>往後，他第一次在本村出現，是當在一家飲食店前被伙計圍住毒打的時候。以後就老給全村的人咒駡，毆打，驅逐，善良的打漁小伙子底影子，是一點都沒有了。</p>
<p>「從前，人家拿勢力來壓碎了你，現在，你打算怎麽樣回答人家呢？唉，我可憐你，可憐你底母親，要是世界上還有公道的話······」她仰起頭，臉上帶點希望的光彩，望住她面前的瘦長的青年。「算起來，你才二十八歲，是的，二十八歲的人，至少還有一半哩······太歲誕那天，我來跟你做雙鞋子，等你好好地走上正路吧。二十八歲，唔，不遲的······」</p>
<p>男人毫無感動地站起身來，狡猾地笑着。「我現在走我底正路去了丨我中飯還沒有吃哩，那自來火柴盒，大槪可以換四毛錢的。」他大步走着，搖搖擺擺地去了。</p>
<p>老女人瞇起眼睛望住他底背影，自言自語道：「可憐的，給什麽人都憎惡了的傢伙········」她佝僂着腰背，跑進屋子裏預備拿柴箍來套起那些散亂的柴。</p>
<p>當她移動着那雙被毁壞了的，紀錄着人類底醜惡的行爲的小脚走出來的時候，發現她底燒青榖水烟袋和劈柴刀都不見了。她呆了一呆，跟住就生氣地，然而遲鈍地，頓着小脚。「天良喪盡了的煞神，對老寡婦也使出你底本領來了。」她大聲駡着，用手遮住太陽，向街頭巷尾两邊張望。一會兒，她又用比較親切的口吻對着空巷子呌起來：</p>
<p>「馬仔，沒良心的，你丨定要來拿鞋子的呀，太歲誕那天，你到我這裏來拿鞋子吧！」（完）</p>
<h3 id="c218">盼 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>晨。季節是初冬的。</p>
<p>窗外是黑，一對失眠的眼睛望着黑，但很久很久的，窗外還是黑。我全記得窗外有两株丁香樹，一根由窗掛下的麻繩子，和一個喂狗的破碗；但現在丁香樹是黑的，麻繩子是黑的，破碗也是黑的。</p>
<p>對着窗是門，我也記得門是深紫色的，但現在門也是黑的。</p>
<p>什麽時候天可亮呢？</p>
<p>失眠的眼睛是饖餓的，渴望着睡，睡了，醒來便好看太陽，但這自然是奢望的；那麽，放棄了睡，等着太陽罷，但等着，窗外却還是黑的。</p>
<p>像是永遠的這樣下去，不會有轉動，也不會有改變，沒有異樣的顏色，也沒有異樣的聲音，像一池死水，像久雨，像炎夏，像辛苦的旅途，你得耐着心等，你得忍下這個受罪。你盼有一天一個死寂的池沼裏忽縐超　　　　也有水草的動；但這在你眼前却分明是一池死水，死一般的靜，死一般的腐爛！</p>
<p>不錯的，你是沒法排遣你天天對着膩了人的久雨的心焦，你盼什麽時候從幾千萬層的沉灰密雲間會不會開露一點日光，你想青天的美麗，和在青天下生命的青；但這在你眼前却分明是一片陰沉沉的，從天亮到天黑，簷前是永遠掛着雨，你心中像也永遠的是濕淋淋的了。</p>
<p>我說這像炎夏，你難道可耐得住迫人的炎夏嗎？你回想一下今年江南的酷熱，在那時你不是只得懇着天，賜下一陣雷雨，一陣輕風，或明兒是一天的陰；但天却不動一點聲色，像是永遠的這樣不講情，你内心燃着火，靈魂也快溶成流質了！</p>
<p>我也不是過分用辛苦的旅途來作比譼，因我嘗過海船統艙的苦，在這地方你需要一個結實的身體，和一點容忍的性格來抵抗骯髒，苦楚，和羞辱。在那裏，你是不信時間是在移動的，船說是後天可到了目的地，你就疑心什麽時候是後天，盤子大的圓窗外却永遠是海，海，藍得要變黑的海。</p>
<p>這世界是停留的，只有一種顏色，一種聲音。我眼前是死水，是久雨，是炎夏，是辛苦的旅途！我望着黑，黑，黑！</p>
<p>我不說對着黑的窗是黑的門嗎？黑的門忽地轉動了，一個小孩和門外走廊的燈光在黑的門的破隙處顯現了，這孩子在桌上放下了一瓶牛奶（我的同屋朋友是一個缺乏營養的年青人），輕輕地把門帶了過去。</p>
<p>一會兒我看見黑的窗外有熹微的曙光，但我却疑心這是不是天亮了？</p>
<h3 id="c219">潼關的黃昏 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴濟寛</p>
<p>三年前。</p>
<p>在那炎熱的夏天，太陽吻着樹梢的時分，我同勉菴兄到了險要的潼關。關城斜斜地踞在山坡上，形勢十分雄偉。東有汽車路通函谷，西有汽車路通西安，渭水也在這里流入黃河，無疑的，它是陜西的要塞，也是陜西的門户。</p>
<p>我們下車休息了片刻，就相約去遊關城。山坡是很高的，城緣着山坡高上去；我們登上了城墻，還要一級級的爬，因爲山陡城也陡的緣故。爬到山腰，我們两邊打量一下，外邊是深深的山谷，裏邊是很陡的斜下去的，稍一不愼，就免不掉要粉身碎骨。這時，太陽已沒了一半，從薄薄的雲裏，射出微弱的光輝，尤其使我們駭怕。但是，登山不到嶺，不能滿足我們好奇的慾望，鼓着勇氣，又向上爬。的確，我的心在畏懼，畏懼到有點跳動不安。我們两個誰也不甘示弱，悶着氣努力上進，畢竟達到了山之高峯。舉目四顧，南面是巍峨重疊的山頭，像是沉在依稀的雲霧裏，北面是一條白帶似的黃河，從蒼茫的遠處流來又向蒼茫的遠處流去。一個人，對着這雄壯的關山，磅礴的流水，總覺得自己太渺小了。</p>
<p>時間是在無形中逝去，蒼茫的暮色，瀰漫着我們的周圍，不容我們慢慢地俯仰眼前的山川，追懷心頭的往事，只好抖擻一下精神，留心地一步一步爬下去。我們的警語，是向前邁進，不要左顧右盼，自可達到安全的境地。果然，在夜幕整個開張的當兒，我們回到了古朴的旅舍。</p>
<h3 id="c220">鼎湖和飛水潭 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>在死般沉靜的圈子里罩籠着的鼎湖，從老遠的海面瞧過去是一座高敞在雲霄里的山峯。在山麓下可以聽到那新鮮的海風吹響了的林梢底聲息，有着一定的幽美底音調永遠地不停的響着。踏着那九曲十三灣的山陰道上去的時候，可以聽到那老是消極的沉痛的和尙寺的鐘聲；給旅人們感到這是一座幽靜的世外桃源。那葱茂的綠葉擋蔽了春天的太陽，更給旅人們感到這里的寒凉，一步一景的山腰上，是瞧不完的幽美的晝圖呢。</p>
<p>在鼎湖，可以看到許多史蹟，蘇東坡流落在南粤的時候也曾常常躱在這兒孤獨地過日子，在飛水潭的天然的美景旁邊的亭子上寫了許多感歎的詩文來的。</p>
<p>三十多丈高的飛水潭上有着四丈闊的雪白的瀑布經過一個弧形才傾瀉下來。那像萬馬奔腾着的洶湧的聲音展開幾個山谷外去；白水的水波在溫暖的太陽底下閃着光彩。深而淸澈的潭池，在炎烈的夏天正是難得的游泳池。</p>
<p>然而，我沉默地倚在滑滑的石板上，望着太空上的太陽的時候，却煽起了無限的思潮來。</p>
<p>丨丨這兒不是人間，也許只是苟安的厭世者的樂園吧了。</p>
<h3 id="c221">人間世（十） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 李煇英</p>
<p>「嫣嫣，金先生來了」。</p>
<p>小菊沒有回答這位金先生問的話，她倒是這麽喊起來。西屋裏的女主人急急喊道：</p>
<p>「先讓到東屋坐下，好茶」。</p>
<p>聽這話，又是個上客。我們來，她是沒有這樣招待恭維的。我想我可以看看這位上客金先生是什麽樣的人物。</p>
<p>「是個朝鮮人」。</p>
<p>這位上客一進屋，我就認出來他的國籍。一個朝鮮人和一個日本人一樣。隨便穿什麽衣服，都是一認就認出來的。然而這道理却又說不出口。你不能說出朝鮮人和日本人在面上刻有某種特徵。隨即我想到他和這家的關係，他大槪是這家私烟館的主子，一條日本人的走狗。　　小菊給他遞烟倒茶，他那種高傲樣子，似乎屋裏一切動物靜物都沒有看在他的眼内。</p>
<p>「這東西，該給他一個釘頭碰碰。」</p>
<p>我負氣要鬥鬥他，不滿意他這種做作。其實，彼此都是亡國奴，又何必存着這種思想。但是，我總是有些氣他的。</p>
<p>「這位是丨」</p>
<p>所以當小菊要替我們介紹時，我搖手止住她。這時，西屋裏女主人和我的朋友先後走進來。</p>
<p>女主人像是把我這主顧都忘却了，不招呼我，只顧和這朝鮮人說些客套話，然後要求他再緩上一天。</p>
<p>他們中間是有金錢來往的關係的。</p>

<h3 id="c222">銀行界投資救濟農村 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>幾年來中國農村已漸呈崩潰，這是鐡般的事實。因而中國農村之有待於救濟，也就成爲目前急不容緩的要圖。邇近全國各地，農村崩潰的慘呌四起。跟着而喊出來的，便是農村救濟的呼聲。然而救濟儘管救濟，崩潰仍是崩潰。救濟農村，豈是空喊幾句口號所能爲力嗎？不管你農村救濟的方案開得怎樣堂皇，要挽回今日農村的厄運，非脚踏實地，按步的做去，是無濟於事的。</p>
<p>近者聞本市銀行界有投資救濟農村之議。緣本市銀行界，鑒於内地經濟衰落，投資救濟，最近一二年來，已具有相當成績。自去年以來，本市各業，均極衰落，致銀行界鉅欵集中，反感放欵困難。同時以投資農村，雖利薄事繁，但信用可靠。於是各銀行决定於今年起，努力經營農村投資。俾農村經營發展，則百業隨之進展。而銀行本身，亦得鞏固。這是一個很好的消息。</p>
<p>近年來中國社會經濟狀况呈一個畸形的發展。卽一方面因受世界經濟恐慌的影響，和天災人禍的打擊，不僅全國農村經濟有焦頭爛額之勢，卽一般工商業，也有捉襟見肘之窘·他方面銀行業反而蒸蒸日上，獨呈繁榮之象。例如去年本市各銀行業均有相當的盈餘，其中尤以中央等四銀行爲最著。可是銀行業發展的結果，却是游資過剩和游資集中於都市。這不但對於國民經濟沒有益處，卽銀行業本身，也屬不利。蓋游資過剩，若能利用於生產事業的建設，我國衰敗的生產事業，未始不能因之而發展。但銀行業本身每因種種關係，不能把這游資移用於生產事業，而轉用於投機的交易（如地產和公債等投資）。如此工商業旣得不到銀行的救濟，銀行業的前途，也沒有多大的希望。故銀行業在這百業凋敝之際，雖表面能維持好况，實際還是不穩健的。</p>
<p>爲今之計，銀行業要是欲盡忠於其自身的職務，應把眼光放遠大些，將所有吸收來的鉅量游資，不單存留於倉庫里，或用於不正當的方面，而儘量使用於扶助生產事業的建設。這不特銀行業游資有正當的出路，能日趨發展，卽農工商各業，也有恢復繁榮的希望。國家社會，受惠不少·</p>
<h3 id="c223">生育競爭 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>人，到了相當的年齡就必要結婚，這原因，是在於「生理」的需要。卽使限於經濟的能力，不能够如願的舉行，然而那「需求」的成分是並不會因而减低的，薄弱的。不是麽？在大的都會間，那犯「姦」的新聞不是在不斷的出現麽？不是在不斷的翻騰着新的花樣嗎？</p>
<p>可是，有的人不知是故意的裝傻呢還是存心責難？曾這樣的問過我；『照你說來，似乎結婚的最高企望在「生理」，但，鄕問的少男，在「生理」上並沒有到「需求」的時間，爲什麽也偏要使他結婚呢？』這個麽，似乎沒有提出來的價值，因爲那原因是太明顯了。</p>
<p>不管結婚的正面到底是需要與否，但，婚後的生育「却是不可避免的一種自然現象，雖則有許多人在這種現象下苦悶着，呼號着以至哀愁着。</p>
<p>眞的，結婚以後要生孩子，生了孩子要增重了負擔，等負擔得太重的時候，能窒住了氣息，能像一個跟斗跌落在棉花包里是的翻不過來。於是心在懊悔着，不該早早結婚，但，懊悔，又有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>丨丨朋友們，節慾吧，使我們的背負减輕一些吧！</p>
<p>不得已的時候，在發出了這樣的感嘆了。可是，人，畢竟是有性靈的動物，畢竟是性靈最敏銳的動物，當你感覺到懊悔的時候，你會「厭惡」，然而，當停在被生理的支配下而需要的時候，前時的厭惡會逃得無影無踪「節慾」和「節育」是都不會存在的，也許過後你會要向自己責罰。</p>
<p>爲了應付這旣成的環境底局面，在古老的用度里，被一層愁的霧罩住了。但，翻開昨天的報紙，美國的多倫多地方，巴那都夫人和甘尼夫人，爲了想爭奪密勒氏的「生育獎金」而努力的生產，並且，爲了要表示自己的產額的迅速，巴那都在向甘尼誇稱伊實無獲勝之機會。自然，甘尼是也不甘緘默的，於此，「再接再厲」着。眞的，從一九二六年算起以十年爲限，那末，距離期滿的時候也不過僅僅地二年了。</p>
<p>到底，誇耀並不是事實，甘尼夫人的速率是超過了巴那都，在八年之間已擧了十一孩，這不能不說是驚人的數目。</p>
<p>但是，再檢點一下自己呢？不要說「竸爭」，連「保守」似乎都不是一件容易的事呢！</p>
<h3 id="c224">新居雜感 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>在上海的核心丨衖堂房子裏住久了，從朝到夜聽慣了那種騒亂的市聲，和不計冬寒夏熱每個夜心擾人淸夢的賣夜食者的呌喊，日子久了，也就漸漸的不覺其如何討厭咶噪，淸晨午夜倒成爲一種熟悉的慣習需要，斬破不少岑寂。現在突然遷到這離上海幾十分鐘汽車這種的小鎭上，第一夜覺得不慣習與冷淸岑寂之感的就是聽不到這種熟悉的慣習的聲的旋律。爲了這個情形的悔懊，好似做錯一椿什麽大不洽心的事情那麽的坐立不安而感到無限的寂寞。</p>
<p>第一夜得來的新居的印象就是如此不好。一個整夜幾乎沒有两個鐘頭以上安安逸逸的酣睡。好如突然間獨個人置身於荒山古廟，那種嚴肅的深山絕壑的凄靜，使人承受不住，生起恐怖的感應，搔抓着汝的神經，一刻不得安靜。</p>
<p>偶然也有幾聲從遠村農家傳來的犬吠，和低沉得幾乎聽不見的汽笛聲。這些若斷若續沉弱凄哀的聲律，都不會些微减少這寂寞的夜心之感的。那幾聲生疎的犬吠更可怕了，彷彿就是一個弱小靈魂受難的哀呻，聽來令人豎起一根根毛髮，打着寒噤。幾次聽到這可怕的慘呌只好把被頭蒙住腦袋。</p>
<p>在十二點鐘以前也還可以聽到幾次火車隆隆奔馳而去的聲嚮。猛然震盪神經，微微的感到一些慰藉，增熱了血流的活躍。不過這個爲時是很短促的。火車漸漸走遠以後，情景仍然回復原來的狀態，而情形也更壞，好似深谷中放過一個爆竹，只有更淸晰的空虚冷靜落了下來，使神經突然失了憑藉吊在空中抓不着邊涯那麽空虚難堪。</p>
<p>第一夜的捱過眞不容易，簡直寃枉地受了一夜罪。那一年病中的失眠之苦，一想起來都會搖頭懼怕。别的苦還可以勉强捱受，或者日子久了可以慣習下去也極可能？唯一使我担心的就是怕因這個情形而害起失眠症來，這罪就够我受了。然而這個未知的難關，將來能不能逃過又頗費猜慮的了。</p>
<p>現在且來說第二夜的情形罷，這眞是一個奇蹟丨這奇蹟的發現也許對於我的情形更壞了，是可以預想得到的。心猜這奇蹟是什麽？原來那時候已是下半夜的三點鐘光景，當我睡意朦朧之際，忽然一陣辣辣的而又極其慘哀的猪的喤呌刺進耳朶來，這不能不令我驚怪起來，稍爲寗靜的神經又復騷亂不安了。呌聲起初尖長而哀，經過一些時候突然一聲凄厲的絕呌，分明是那隻可憐的蠢物的最後掙扎，以後就寂然無聲。這時候的神經眞要爆炸開來那麽難當，簡直無法可想來安靜下去。紅的血，白的刀，掙扎的顫戰着的靈魂，兇狼殘酷漝臭嘔人的臉孔，一幕屠塲的慘景淸淸晰晰的擺在面前。我用盡方法把眼睛閉着想避免遏止這個聯想。但努力的結果越發糟糕，那掙扎着的已不是猪而變爲人了，而且多了個血淋的頭，張開了慘白的大口，支解的四肢，熱氣騰騰跳蹦着的鮮赤的心······就是這麽做着惡夢似的一直挨到天亮。那股慘呌也間歇一次復起一次的鬧到天亮。</p>
<p>然而，天下的事情儘是那麽要被人擺佈，沒有容自己的意志去支配取捨的餘地與自由的。爲了這個原因，這新居雖然有着這許多不能居住的理由，也無可如何，只好硬起頭皮住下去。</p>

<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>一個電影明星除了投身影界爲自己賺錢，養活個人之外，他還要顧到聘請他的東家，爲公司賺錢，所賺的結果，就是他可以享受互益的待過。有些電影明星祗有自己的聲價，優厚的薪水，拍了片子，公司耗費巨大攝製費用，而結果這張片子要賠本，公司要吃虧。反之，有些電影明星雖然聲價不高，酬勞不厚，但所演的戯都能賺錢，公司聘請他有所樂意的，這種明星就很難能可貴的了。</p>
<p>好萊塢的電影明星雖然多，但未必個個能爲公司賺錢，其中不少完全爲了明星面子關係，而受聘於某公司。如果我們能够尋出那個明星能够賺錢，我們就可以推測那個明星將來的命運了。</p>
<p>或許是我們說出來會使一般讀者驚異，但這裏不妨預先聲明，以下的數目都是根據最近美國影業報年刋所載，他們把美國自有電影以來統計所有賺過一百萬美金的出品，詳細列了一個表給人參考。從這個表就可以看出誰是好萊塢賺錢最多的明星，因爲能够爲公司賺過一百萬元的明星實在是一般觀衆最歡迎的明星，也可以說一句這種明星才可以永遠站在電影圈裏。</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾是好萊塢賺錢最多的明星了。她所主演的片子當中有七張出品是爲公司賺過一百萬美金的。其中五張是她與却爾斯福雷做搭擋的。從這個成績說起來珍妮蓋諾所演的戲比任何好萊塢明星是較迎合一般觀衆心理了。滑稽明星羅克，雖然曾經在「不怕死」一片侮辱過我們中國人，不爲我國人所喜悅，但他是好萊塢明星中賺過一百萬美金的第二位。他所做過的片子中有五張出品是超過百萬收入的。第三位賺過百萬的人也是表演詼諧戲劇的人却利卓别麟，同時已故的小生范倫鐡諾與福斯台柱華納裴士德，也可以與卓别麟并列第三位。以上三個人每個都有三張出品是多過百萬收入的。其餘的明星爲公司賺過一百萬美金在两張出品數目者有愛德門羅，李却巴塞爾密斯，華雷士皮萊，已故郎却乃，朗那柯門，琵琵丹妮兒，桃樂絲德里奥，李却狄士，已故瑪麗特蘭漱，葛麗泰嘉寳，約翰吉爾勃，亞爾喬生，狄克鮑惠爾，惠爾羅吉士，與梅蕙絲等。有四個明星丨丨瑪麗辟克福，島格拉斯范朋克，凱塞琳赫本，與康絲登本𣵀丨丨每人祗有一張出品是賺過一百萬美金的。</p>
<p>這個表上雖然舉出七十三張片子爲賺過百萬美金，我們祇就其中爲國人所熟悉的舉出數張，來引證他們所以賺錢的理由。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c232">評「美人心」 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Pri　vate　Life　of　Don</p>
<p>Juan丨南京</p>
<p>唐璜，這一中世紀的英雄的美男子，在許多傳奇的羅曼斯中，他不僅爲多少女人所顚倒，而多少青年男子，也將他當作理想中的典型的勇士。於是唐璜的英名在社會中的影響很大，因此前有默片的約翰巴里摩亞主演「唐璜」（ＤｏｎＪｕａｎ），現在又有范朋克主演的「唐璜的私生活「Ｐｒｉｖａｌｅ　Ｌｉｔｃ　ｏｆ　Ｄｏｎ　Ｊｕａｎ）），不是沒有社會根據的了。</p>
<p>被譯名爲「美人心」的「唐璜的私生活」，在「英宮艶史」和「凱塞琳女王」之後，在亞力山大科達（Ａｌｅｘａｎｄｅｒ　Ｋｏｒｄａ）導演之下，其最爲成功的便是對於這一英雄無情的諷刺。在這裏使我們聯想起西萬提斯的「唐吉訶德」，他將那沒落的騎士加以無情的諷刺。然而勃布斯脫在電影上却沒有完全做到這一點，銀幕上的唐吉訶德是給人們同情了的。但是在亞力山大柯達導演之下的唐璜，他不像約翰巴里摩亞州演的「唐璜」那般對於大情人的英雄禮讚，歌頌，他所要做到的是對於唐璜盡情的諷刺了。</p>
<p>我們看罷，唐璜的一生，在這裏是怎樣被描寫着的。在西班牙，他被稱爲大情人，他使許多少女背叛着自己的丈夫獻身於他，祇要待着他的一吻，便引爲莫大的榮幸。於是在如此盛名之下，便有惡少年的假唐璜出現，和情人的丈夫格鬥以死，眞唐璜的英名也就從此湮宣下去。當成羣的女人在墳塲憑弔的時候，我們的唐璜是啼笑皆非，原來他的榮譽，也不過是任人們兒戲般的安排而已。其後他以假將軍的資格在小旅店裏度過了十年靜寂的光陰，閨中少婦們追懷着他的英姿，他的小傳也是洛陽紙貴的暢銷着，而眞的唐璜却給人們不斷的奚落或嘲弄着。他給老婦戲弄，他給年輕的侍女嘲笑，他給另一少婦作爲父親一般的親暱，甚至於不再有人和他嬉遊了。於是他感覺人生的孤寂，在苦笑的歲月中他抖擻精神的希望在老人的臉上化裝爲青年的光彩。可是死去那的年輕的唐璜到底不再被人們了解，當他回到塞維爾城的時候，那曾經熱戀過他的歌女是不認識他了，他在戲院中是給女人們難堪的嘲弄了。雖然他的妻到底接待了他，可是他却深深的體味到人生苦味了。從這些晝面中所啟示我們的是苦笑的人生，這由光榮到沒落的唐璜，給與人們若干程度的同情，然而這同情是包含在殘酷的嘲笑中散發出來的。</p>
<p>再說罷，唐璜這人，在導演手法之下，他却是一個滑稽人物。他在和女人幽會的時候，每一次都是那同樣的幾句讚美的言詞，這和那假唐璜跳樓跌交是沒有两樣的。特别是老了以後回到塞維爾城的種種，以至於爬樓和妻幽會，無一不表現他可憐的滑稽。當我們看過這一影片之後，人生的苦痛滋味，重重的襲上了我們的心頭。</p>
<p>就演出方面來說，也許導演和編劇者在前一部份略嫌零亂一點。可是就整個的來說，却仍是很成功的。爲了說明這一點，我們可舉出舞女安都麗達的迷人的跳舞，以及許多成羣的黑衣婦人送葬的塲面，那眞假情人的爭風吃醋，那唐璜的哭笑不得的神情，都可證明亞力山大柯達手法的精練。</p>
<p>更由於攝影的優秀和音響效果和晝面的結合，使我們從美妙的夜的街頭，從四絃琴肉情歌中，從膽胸的女人身上，深深的體念到中世紀的西班牙的風光。特别是中於瑪麗娥珀龍（Ｍｅｒｌｅ　Ｏｈｅｒｏｎ）優秀的演技，那自樓上下來的舞蹈，眞是太迷醒了。至於范朋克的演技，却甚嫌不够，粗魯的動作不够表現所謂大情人的瀟灑與多情，他不過是一個戲弄女人的惡魔而已。</p>

<p>— 横雲</p>
<p>英國倫敦影片公司在一九三三年，製成了驚人的「英宮艶史」而發現了却爾斯勞頓的天才。一九三四年，攝製了「凱塞琳女皇」而定了褒格娜藝林中地位。同時愛爾斯德里Ｅｌｓｔｒｅｅ儼然和美國好萊塢望衡對宇地，樹起了鞏固的壁壘。這是誰的功績呢？恐怕英國愛爾斯德里倘若沒有亞歷山大戈泰的那樣導演天才，舊大陸影片至今還沒有得到世界的注視罷。這是誰也不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>銀史開元以來第一位且第一流武俠浪漫大明星，婦孺皆知的范朋克，他的成功全在把武士道精神充分地表演着。當然，現代作風是斷斷不適宜他那特異的個性的。所以「三劍客」，「俠盜」，「盪寇」，等傑作，亦祗有他來嘗試。他本來亦可以優游林下，不必再羽冠長劍，矯健奮迅於銀幕上了，（據此次與曼麗畢克馥正式離婚，即爲范氏將與英京某貴婦結褵之先聲。此後范氏或能受爵而躋貴族之列。所以在「美人心」片上，銜名爲范朋克君（Ｍｒ·Ｆａｉｒｄａｎｋｓ）云云）可是范氏終於接受了戈泰導演，（范氏諸片皆係親身導演者）而攝成了這十九世紀大情人唐璜秘史之「美人心」。</p>
<p>「美人心」旣屬英國攝製家，目爲一九三五年最偉大的巨片，所以僅配角一項，却已竭力經營。他們自稱「美人心」中美人，實監島國東西南北四方之選。其女主角曼兒奥蓓朗，芳齡花信，是范氏數度嚴密遴擇之結果，而貝妮許謨平妮彭絲瓊伽特娜柏莉茜希頼等，都是銀壇上鼎鼎大名之明星。至於錄音取景，處理作意，均臻上上乘。不錯，這是英國愛爾斯德里對一九三五的好萊塢，給予的一個重大的威脅。</p>

<p>— 兆初</p>
<p>衆人給蕭打紛紛退後，他却抓住那個搗亂的人，高高舉起擲去，那搗亂的竟被他投進濁水河裹，掙扎不已，衆人見勢不佳，再經秦蕭二人驅逐，均紛紛散去。洪馮即上前向秦蕭稱謝，洪馮和秦蕭相見，楊秀淸亦走上，洪向拱手稱謝；「感謝二位大力帮助，不然要遭們的圍困了，」秦回答着說；「我見他們太横蠻不講理，怕你要吃虧，才出來帮助一下的，」蕭亦回言說；「我一身受打抱不平，這算作什麽事，」洪馮很謙遜的，又招呼他們說；「我們今天難得相逢，請到前面酒店裏坐一會吧，」</p>
<p>桌面上擺了酒盅菜肴，已經是吃了一半，洪馮秦蕭楊一同坐着，洪將斟滿的酒舉起，又勸衆人乾了一杯，隨後洪放下酒杯，繼續說下去道；「所以我雖然經了這些挫折，並不退却，現在最緊要的，是要把睡在迷夢裏的同胞喚醒過來，」秦曰綱聽了這番說話，眉飛色舞的說道；「洪先生的說話，句句鑽進我的心眼裏，我願意終身跟你當一名小卒，」說了趕即立起，隨即步至洪的面前，打了一個躬，跪了一跪，洪連連起立，請他坐下。蕭朝貴亦把手恭了一恭說道；「我蕭朝貴空有一身氣力，沒有地方去用，洪先生看得起，用得到我，一腔子的熱血就有處灑了，」洪馮連連稱謝說；「感謝諸位的盛意，只恨我不才不德，不敢承當啊」，說了就舉起杯子，勸大家再飲一杯，楊秀淸放下杯兒，心中沉思了一會，向洪馮說道；「二位現在應該有一個根據地方，就容易進行發展，」洪歏息着道；「這正是我們的困難，在廣東被官吏注意，到廣西又人地生疏，」楊秀淸乃微笑說道；「我倒可以舉薦一個地方，就是這裏金田村曾玉珩的家裏，他是這裏大地主，又是一個有志氣的，他不願意做官，專喜結交朋友，洪先生如果肯去，我想他一定是很歡迎的，」洪馮聽了，均面現喜色道；「這是最好的了，我們豈有不肯去之理，」楊隨即點頭說道；「事機亦實是凑巧，我們這次正是押了貸銀，送到他村裏去，正好一同前去，」洪聽了異常興奮的繋着掉子說；「這眞是天假之緣，也許我們的事業，就要在這裏創發了啊！」說了，爾朝貴搶取了酒壼，在各人面前斟了酒，同舉起了祝賀一杯，</p>
<p>洪秀全安居金田村，與曾玉珩意氣相投，楊蕭亦收束镳局，在金田村聚合，不久便創立保良攻匪會，同謀大事。保良攻匪會門邊，貼了一張保良攻匪會招募處的字條，門邊設了两棹子，擺了許多簿册，有許多人來投報，都逐一登記，楊秀淸監視着，蕭朝貴秦日綱在旁檢查來人的體格，口裏還唱着名字，</p>
<p>一天曾玉珩洪秀全楊秀淸同坐在那裏商議大事，忽然走進一個莊丁說道；「外面來了一個人，要見主人和洪先生，問他姓名，他不肯說，」三人聽了，遲疑了一下說；「去請他進來丨楊秀淸隨即將簿册收起，門口突然走進一個大漢，對着他們很正經的面容，大聲說道；「你們在這裏假着保良會的名義，招兵買馬，謀反朝廷，就不怕遭殺身之禍嗎？你們瞞得過别人，却瞞不過我，」說時神色很是嚴厲，三人聽了，倒被他怔住了，曾玉珩回身要取懸掛壁上的寳劍，那人見了哈哈大笑說道；你們好眼力，却認不得我石達開嗎？」曾放下劍，三人明白了過來，洪秀全轉了笑臉道；「閣下就是石達開先生嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>Awaiting the Development of the Situation</p>
<p>Observing Whether It Endangers the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>Then Determining Whether to Take Concerted Action with the UK</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the impression here in Washington today, the United States will not take any action regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict in Chahar unless the situation escalates to the point of endangering the Nine-Power Treaty or other treaties. Officials here are keeping silent about this matter and are waiting for the situation to unfold. Everyone hopes that its nature will not be as serious as reported. Officials in Washington are especially unwilling to take any action to stimulate either side. The government now appears to be maintaining a policy of quiet observation to see if the expression of militarism in the Far East can be slightly reduced without external stimulation. If so, then it is still possible to hope that the psychological atmosphere will improve slightly and that the naval conference can be reopened. However, because the United Kingdom and the United States have the same views on oil and naval issues, informed sources here indicate that if international treaties are truly violated, the United Kingdom and the United States will take the same actions.

<p>The Japanese Army's Invasion of Chahar</p>
<p>(London) The Times published an essay comparing Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's declaration on policy towards China with the recent incidents in Chahar Province, China.</p>
<p>It said that foreigners have some doubts about Japan's peaceful declaration, which is certainly reasonable. The Japanese government should not find this strange. "The recent incidents in Chahar Province are a dispute over borders between 'Manchukuo' and its master, Japan, and China. The issue itself is not important. However, Foreign Minister Hirota declared a few days ago that he would treat China with goodwill. Now, his words are still ringing in our ears, and the Chahar incident has already broken out. It can be seen that the Japanese military does everything it deems appropriate militarily, regardless of political considerations, and Japanese diplomats have no way to stop it. This newspaper's correspondent in Tokyo believes that the Chahar incident was caused by the free actions of the Japanese army in 'Manchukuo,' and said that the free and unrestricted actions of the Roman Emperor Caesar and his army in Gaul (now France) reflect the actions of the modern Japanese army, and the correct interpretation of various events in the Far East in recent years can also be obtained from this. In short, unless the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs can persuade the country's military to respond to the policies announced by the country's government one day, the peaceful declarations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokespersons will not gain the trust of foreigners one day. This is not surprising." (25th Havas Telegram)</p>

To bridge the two continents, the Eurasian route across the Black Sea and the majestic mountains, which we call the "Avenue of the Genovese," stands as a testament in world history to the dedication of Italians in connecting East and West.

This mission aligns with the objectives of all endeavors of the Italian government, envisioning the future based on past plans. Italy, under the guidance of a great leader, has been revitalized through a spiritual reformation. This coincides with the same movement and similar aspirations of your nation's leaders, who are concentrating their efforts on the construction of a new China. Therefore, the cooperation between our two nations is gradually developing with mutual relevance in history. I firmly believe that the government of the Great Republic of China will value the friendly policy of Italy towards China, as its policy is neither biased nor does it serve any other purpose. I sincerely hope that I will receive your Excellency's favor and assistance in performing my duties, and I also wish for the support of all the wise men currently leading China towards a glorious future.

<h3 id="e16">The Chahar Eastern Region Issue <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Since the 20th of this month, the Chahar eastern region has suddenly been attacked by Japanese puppet troops, with infantry and cavalry advancing in all directions, and aircraft bombing. Detailed reports and accurate statistics are currently difficult to obtain. However, the unprovoked aggression of the Japanese puppet troops is a fact. Unexpectedly, Japanese newspapers such as the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun have described this event as an invasion of the Jehol border by Chinese troops, claiming that the Japanese army's actions were for self-defense. Today, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a report from the Kwantung Army, sent instructions to its overseas embassies, propagating this narrative and placing responsibility on the Chinese army. If they adopt this line to deal with this issue, not only will the various problems between China and Japan since the September 18th Incident be difficult to resolve, but also all international justice will be impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>Since the Zhangjiakou Incident last year, the Chinese government has made every effort to maintain peace, and its diplomatic policy towards Japan has strived to minimize and resolve all issues. This is known to the world. Even regarding eastern Chahar, the facts are not only different from what the Japanese have claimed, but also, after the dispersal of Liu Guitang's troops and the westward relocation of Zhang Yunrong's troops from Shangdu, China has not stationed any troops there. How could there be any disturbance of the Jehol border? The Japanese authorities should be aware of this situation. Is it possible that the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, which pays great attention to peace relations in the Far East, is unaware of this? This is what the Chinese people should first declare.</p>
<p>Recently, the external propaganda and diplomatic movements within Japan have shown a tendency to gradually return to normalcy. It is making efforts to show goodwill towards the United States, maintaining a serious attitude towards the Soviet Union, and also seeking understanding with the United Kingdom. Although its attitude towards China is not entirely clear, it also seems to have a peaceful inclination. The possibility of re-establishing peaceful relations in East Asia may temporarily exist. During this period, even if there are misunderstandings with the Chinese troops in eastern Chahar, they should be resolved through diplomatic channels. Now, while the diplomatic authorities are declaring friendship, the military is acting independently. This will not only make future efforts at friendship impossible, but also render all previous efforts futile. This is what Japanese intellectuals deeply regret.</p>
<p>When the Preparatory Conference for the Naval Disarmament Treaty reached an impasse at the end of last year, the international situation temporarily became perilous. However, since the Franco-Italian understanding was reached at the beginning of this month, and the United States joined the International Court of Justice, and the Saar plebiscite results were announced, the atmosphere of world peace has become stronger again. Consequently, the naval reduction issue among Britain, the United States, and Japan will also be influenced by the peaceful atmosphere. In the near future, a naval arms race is unlikely to occur. However, the relationship between China and Japan is a crucial key to the Far Eastern issue. If it is not handled appropriately, it could impede the progress of peace between the two countries, or even jeopardize the global peace situation. Therefore, China's forbearance and restraint are solely for the sake of international relations and the responsibility of maintaining world peace. Japan should calmly study this matter and avoid self-deception through embellishment. Moreover, the area of eastern Chahar was originally very peaceful. After several bombings, China remains calm. The rights and wrongs are very clear. Therefore, the Japanese diplomatic community is already aware that this matter should not be escalated. Even the military attache stationed in Japan believes that it will not lead to a major crisis. Therefore, the future of this issue depends entirely on Japan's proper handling of it.</p>
<p>China has made every effort for peace and has not hesitated to pay a high price for peace. If it still cannot obtain a peaceful understanding, it knows where the responsibility lies and how to protect itself. Currently, China's economy and military may lag behind other nations. However, the loyalty of its people to the country may not be inferior to that of advanced nations. Japan shares the same writing system as China and has a deep historical and cultural connection. It should know that the Chinese nation is by no means a lazy nation. If Japan truly wants to maintain peace in the Far East, it should not rely on military force as a panacea and disregard everything else.</p>

<p>Optimistic About the Future of Independence</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Governor-General Murphy, who went to the United States to confer with President Roosevelt on the issue of Philippine independence, passed through here today on the President Hoover. He was accompanied by Quezon, the Speaker of the Philippine Senate and future President of the Republic. Quezon will return to Manila on the President Grant. The US Consul General Hoover and a representative of Hong Kong Governor Peel boarded the ship to welcome them. Murphy said that since departing from Manila, he and Quezon had discussed the Philippine constitution at length, focusing particularly on the procedures for obtaining US approval under the law and other steps for organizing the republican government. He did not touch upon amending the Philippine Independence Act. Murphy expressed optimism about the future of the Philippine Republican government, stating that they are fully prepared to rebuild the republican government, and the Philippine people have long awaited it. The republican government will certainly succeed. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>Senate Still Has Opposition</p>
<p>(Washington) Those in the Senate opposed to the United States joining the World Court are still struggling today, while government leaders are planning to find a way to vote on the case as soon as possible. The opposition attempted a compromise when the Senate passed a reservation proposed by Republican Senator Vandenberg that other countries cannot interfere in US internal affairs. Reynolds still claims that joining the World Court is a shortcut for the United States to join the League of Nations. Reynolds also stated that only France and Italy have benefited in the League of Nations, as in the recent Franco-Italian understanding on North African territories. However, for China, the League of Nations is at a loss for solutions. Afterward, an Associated Press reporter interviewed Reynolds, and he reiterated his previous statement, adding that Japan is planning to seize Australia within fifty years. He said, "Japan is doing whatever it wants in China, first invading Manchuria, and now reaching Mongolia. At that time, the League of Nations handed over the German-owned islands in the Pacific to Japan for trusteeship, which has brought them closer to Australia by thousands of miles. And Australia is Japan's only backdoor." (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>To Develop Natural Resources</p>
<p>Public Works Bill Passed by the House</p>
<p>Requires $480 Million</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed the government's $4,880,000,000 relief bill by a vote of 328 to 78. During the debate, the government派 (faction) struck down various amendments. The bill has now been sent to the Senate. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today sent a special message to Congress, proposing to allocate tens of thousands of millions of US dollars to preserve and develop the nation's natural resources. After the message was read, the House immediately passed the Public Works Relief Bill, which requires $480,000,000. The President's message stated that the nation's natural resources, such as land, timber, minerals, water, etc., urgently need to stop the careless waste. At the same time, the National Resources Committee also presented a long-term plan to develop public works over the next twenty years, requiring approximately $500 million annually, totaling $100,000 million. President Roosevelt said that a large part of the $480 million in the Public Works Relief Bill could be used for the National Resources Committee, saying, "Once the current unemployment crisis has improved slightly, we can allocate another $500 million annually." The committee has also suggested plans to control floods, prevent soil erosion, rebuild forests, and nationalize bituminous coal. (Si Min News, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">American Economics Professor Criticizes Silver Purchase Policy <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Financial Instability</p>
<p>Japan Also Affected</p>
<p>Montreal Professor 台 of economics at McGill University gave a speech here today, vehemently criticizing the US government's silver purchase policy, saying that the US is implementing Roosevelt's silver policy, buying up most of the world's silver reserves, but its purpose is unknown, merely causing countries around the world to seek another international price standard. If it continues to stubbornly follow its own path, the result will be that the United States absorbs most of the world's silver, the same as absorbing most of the world's gold. Gold can no longer be the standard of international value. China, the only silver-using country in the world, will now be forced to abandon the silver standard. Countries around the world will now have to use the pound sterling as the international price standard. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) House Silverite leader Freshman declared today that the impact of rising silver prices on Chinese finance is only temporary. China is currently experiencing currency contraction, similar to the currency contraction in gold-using countries after the rise in gold prices. Corrective measures are now being taken to satisfy China. The fundamental way to alleviate the financial and economic difficulties of China and other countries lies in raising world prices. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) China's strong opposition to the US silver purchase policy has prompted attention in Washington to Japan's reaction to the policy. Speculation has arisen regarding discussions between Japanese financial leaders and bankers from "Manchukuo" to place the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the new silver yuan of "Manchukuo" on an equal footing. Experts in Washington do not believe that Japan will establish a fixed relationship between "Manchukuo's" silver yuan and the Japanese yen recently for two reasons: (1) Most of the people of "Manchukuo" are accustomed to using silver yuan. (2) Establishing a relationship between "Manchukuo's" silver yuan and the Japanese yen would cause "Manchukuo" to lose its independent form. However, this may be possible in the future after Japan controls "Manchukuo's" commerce and Japanese yen become commonly used in "Manchukuo", and the Japanese yen becomes the reserve currency of "Manchukuo's" banks. Congressional silverites once believed that Japan also supported raising silver prices because rising silver prices would increase the purchasing power of India and China. However, according to recent news from the East, the Japanese have realized that the rise in silver prices not only fails to increase China's purchasing power, but actually causes China to lose silver yuan, the only currency of transaction. Japan is also quite affected by the US silver purchase policy because rising silver prices disrupt China's commerce and finance. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Vigorously Condemns <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Nationalization of Banks Plan</p>
<p>Supports Government's Currency Depreciation Policy</p>
<p>Says it Can Lead to Domestic Revival</p>
<p>(London) At the annual meeting of the Midland Bank today, Chairman McKenna (who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1915) spoke out against the plan proposed by some to nationalize banks, and stated the dangers of the banking monopoly system and the convenience of the existing banking organization. McKenna praised the government's cheap money policy, saying that if this policy continues, it will definitely lead to domestic recovery. He also said that the gradual domestic recovery will inevitably absorb greater imports, but this will facilitate the payment of interest on overseas investments, so, in summary, the balance of payments remains unchanged. Today, as gold prices continue to fall, the value of the pound sterling remains stable.</p>
<p>This is the good effect of Britain abandoning the gold standard. Under the old system, the depreciation of the pound sterling would have required the implementation of contraction plans, which would have adversely affected commerce. But today, there is no need for contraction. In his personal opinion, he does not believe that the recovery of domestic businesses has reached its peak, because a large supply of labor has not yet been utilized, and many basic desires have not yet been satisfied.

<p>Seeking Rapid Development of the Corporatist System</p>
<p>All Policies Remain the Same</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian cabinet has recently been reshuffled. In addition to Prime Minister Mussolini, who remains Minister of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, Air Force, Corporations, and Colonies, Finance Minister Junger has been replaced by Turin Provincial Governor Lival. Education Minister Egorel has been replaced by Ambassador to the Vatican Count Difursiber. Agriculture Minister Acebo has been replaced by Deputy Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office, Losani. Labor Minister DiCloralarange has been replaced by Lacha, the former representative to the International Labor Conference. Justice Minister Francis has been replaced by Sormi, the former Deputy Minister of Education. Count Xunibo has been appointed as Minister of Transportation, and three Deputy Ministers and the Prince Rudovici, Governor of Rome, have also been dismissed and reassigned. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reorganized the cabinet on schedule, replacing many current cabinet members with people who have assisted him in organizing the Corporate Council, which is the economic parliament of Italy. The purpose of the Italian Prime Minister seems to be to quickly develop the Italian corporatist system with their help. Rivar, the new Minister of Finance, was originally the Mayor of Turin. Mussolini, as before, remains in charge of seven ministries. Prince Peng Kebagni was appointed as a nominal state official today to reward his services. Potais has been appointed to fill the post of Governor of Rome, which he left behind. The Corporate Council is a revolutionary new type of parliament responsible for managing Italy's economic life. It has representatives from twenty-two fascist corporate bodies, including all departments of Italy's productive activities. Mussolini, as Prime Minister of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Prime Minister of each corporate body, each corporate body has representatives from both labor and management, as well as three fascist party members to monitor all political resolutions in the group.

<p>Nation Divided into Twenty-Two Administrative Districts</p>
<p>Each District to Have a Governor Representing the Central Government</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's plan to overhaul the current German political structure, long awaited, has taken another step forward with today's cabinet meeting. A new plan, modeled after the French system, divides the country into several administrative regions. Each region will be governed by a National Socialist administrator holding full administrative powers. Judicial authority in each state and province will be under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice. Today's cabinet meeting also considered legislation to reduce interest rates for banks and other lending institutions, viewing this as an important plan to assist industry and commerce and promote government projects. The plan is expected to be presented for discussion when the Reichstag reconvenes on the 30th of this month. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government has promulgated laws to change the local system, concentrating local power in the central government. The German states are completely abolished and replaced by twenty-two large administrative regions. Prussia's twelve provinces are each divided into one region, while the remaining former states are divided into ten regions. Each region is headed by a governor, abolishing the former premiership system. The governor represents the central government and holds administrative power. Judicial power no longer belongs to the local level but to the central government. Furthermore, regulations within the reform law for rural towns and villages stipulate that the National Socialist Party can intervene in the administrative power of towns and villages. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the reorganization of the National Socialist Party's armed forces, it is generally understood that it will be carried out according to the principles previously announced by Führer Hitler. That is, only the national defense forces within the Third Reich are allowed to be equipped with military arms. Although the Party's armed forces do not necessarily have to be regarded as ordinary citizens, all national military training must be centralized under the guidance of the national defense forces, with the Party's armed forces serving as their reserve. From now on, all those who have reached the age of military service must join the national defense forces. Upon retirement, they will still be listed in the military register of the Party's armed forces in order to complete their military training. The National Socialist Party's guard will also be reorganized in the same spirit. According to the results of the German reorganization of the Party's armed forces, the Party's armed forces must disarm, which has been implemented in most parts of Germany. The only exception is in the areas stipulated for disarmament by the Treaty of Versailles. This is because all civil groups in these areas are similar to the Party's armed forces. According to the provisions of the treaty, their duties are to undertake national defense to a certain extent. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Recovery of 300 Million Francs</p>
<p>Basel French and German experts are continuing to discuss the financial issues of the Saar region. An agreement has been reached regarding the recovery of French banknotes within the Saar region. These banknotes total approximately 300 million francs. Five percent of this amount will be held by the Bank for International Settlements as collateral for Saar regional bonds, while the remaining ninety-five percent will be used as part of the redemption price for the Saar coal mines and paid into the Bank for International Settlements' account for France. However, the total redemption price was previously agreed upon as 900 million francs, leaving a significant difference. This will be compensated by Germany supplying 1.5 million tons of coal annually for five years. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Proactive Approach to China and Russia</p>
<p>Finance Minister Believes Reform of the Puppet Currency System is Inadvisable</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives convened at 1:20 PM today. First, Mr. Kyōichi Yamamichi, a member of the Kokumin Dōmei (National Alliance), took the floor to raise questions on financial and economic matters, parliamentary politics, and diplomacy, particularly focusing on relations with Manchukuo, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The currency system of "Manchukuo" is still the same as China, based on silver, which is a great contradiction. Economic cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo cannot take its first step without implementing currency reform. (2) The reform plan for the organs stationed in Manchuria should be based on the government's plan due to the actual situation. However, the handling of the plan is inappropriate, as politics is the sum of the legal system and military force. Interpreting it this way can cause unfortunate events. If law and force without politics are used, it would be the same as going against the ancients.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Takahashi's Answer</p>
<p>The economic relationship between "Manchukuo" and mainland China is inseparable. If China is excluded, there is no way to discuss Manchukuo. Therefore, without considering what will happen to China in the future, one cannot easily talk about currency system reform for "Manchukuo". When it is possible to switch to the gold standard in the future, we can discuss the methods. For now, it is best to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota's Answer</p>
<p>My speech is definitely not a so-called diplomatic document. I truly do not have a single selfish thought on matters related to diplomacy. I will express my personal aims here. Although there may be disagreements, I hope for understanding. I am willing to dedicate my life to diplomacy with China.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr. Hitoshi Ashida raised questions about diplomatic policy, which Foreign Minister Hirota answered separately. Finally, regarding international relations, he said, "I will not allow war to break out during my term." Prime Minister Okada also gave answers. The session adjourned at 6:25 PM. (Nippon Dempo News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota answered Mr. Hitoshi Ashida's questions on the Japan-Russia issue at today's House of Representatives session in the afternoon, stating the following: I plan to propose to the Soviet Union that the Russian, puppet, and Japanese armies withdraw from the borders. My ideal is to have a demilitarized zone like the North China demilitarized zone on the Russian-puppet border. However, if a Japan-Russia non-aggression treaty is not implemented by both sides, it is equivalent to waste paper. Therefore, we will not start work on it first. (Hua Lian News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Seiyūkai (Political Friends Association) Members Question Rural Relief</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Three days have passed in the parliamentary question battle. Questions about general administrative policies have largely concluded in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. Further debates politically will not likely raise any major issues. The House of Representatives held a budget committee meeting concurrently with the main session today, beginning the process of deliberation on the final controversial motions of this extraordinary Diet session. The lively question and answer session transferred from the main meeting on various political issues, the budget committee will have considerable energy, in contrast to the subdued tone of the main session. (Dentsu, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The first day of the House of Representatives' Budget Committee meeting began in a tense atmosphere at 10:35 AM today. Chairman Sunada broadly proposed:</p>

The cause was an electrical short circuit. (Nippon Dempo News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(3) Three agenda items regarding contracts outside the budget, requiring government expenditure, were requested to provide explanatory documents. Immediately thereafter, questioning began. Mr. Kiruku Ōkuchi of the Seiyūkai first questioned the government's opinion on the causes of rural poverty. Finance Minister Takahashi took the stand and answered that the relief funds were emergency measures but had fully achieved their purpose. Next, Prime Minister Okada took the stand, saying that the government was aware of the poverty in rural areas, etc., and would not underestimate the budget, excluding military expenditures. Mr. Ōkuchi took the stand again to question, and Prime Minister Okada, Agriculture Minister Yamazaki, and others successively gave answers, with the same wording as in the Extraordinary Diet session. The session adjourned at 12:15 PM. (Dentsu, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's House of Representatives plenary session opened at 1:20 PM. The center of the political storm has shifted to the Budget Committee, and the Diet chamber had many empty seats. Due to this, the atmosphere was lax. First, Mr. Shuichi Yamatō of the Kokumin Dōmei took the stage, stating that the purpose of establishing a National Policy Deliberation Council is aligned with the fundamental reform of the government advocated by Kokumin Dōmei, which is excellent. He followed this by saying that the political and economic structure of this Deliberation Council, if it is organized by the status quo maintenance faction, what is the truth of this. He then discussed the military budget for the tenth year of Shōwa (1935) and whether the government intends to reorganize the tax system, as well as countermeasures to relieve farmers, fishermen, silkworm raisers, small-scale industrialists, and merchants. Further inquired as to China policy and whether the Foreign Minister intends to come out personally. And further questioned the currency system of "Manchukuo," with Prime Minister Okada and Finance Minister Takahashi answering. Later, Mr. Yojiro Matsutani of the first control chamber took the stage to discuss relieving rural poverty, with Prime Minister Okada and Interior Minister Gotō answering. Finally, Hitoshi Ashida of the Seiyūkai questioned, with Foreign Minister Hirota, Prime Minister Okada, and Commerce Minister Machida, and others answering. The session adjourned at 6:24 PM.

<p>(New York) The entire country is experiencing a severe cold wave, the worst in fifty years. The number of deaths has reached one hundred, mostly from freezing or drowning. However, a warming trend is expected in a few days. While the northern states and part of the south remain extremely cold, temperatures in the east and southwest have risen. The cold in the Midwest has broken a fifty-year record and is also expected to warm up. New England is currently working to clear the snow. New York City received sixteen inches of snow and is now using over 40,000 people to clear it. While the cold wave is showing signs of waning, there are still major storms in several parts of the country, followed by heavy flooding. Rainfall has broken records. A large part of Washington State has been flooded due to snowmelt and continuous rain. At least fourteen people have drowned in the south. The waters of all rivers have flooded the streets and cities. Many important towns are experiencing traffic congestion due to flooding, and several thousand people are perched on treetops and rooftops and have been rescued by gasoline boats, but there are still many in dangerous places, all calling for help. The situation in Canada is equally dire. Vancouver has been cut off for three days due to heavy snow. Several transcontinental trains have been stopped in the Rocky Mountains due to landslides and avalanches blocking the tracks. Many workers are currently clearing them. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Simon Defamation Case <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Apologizes and Settles the Matter</p>
<p>(London) The Bishop of Dorchester, in a speech at a local Free Church meeting, stated that many members of Parliament and cabinet ministers invest in arms factories, so they are actually the instigators of our wars. He also said that Foreign Secretary Simon overturned the peace movement promoted by the League of Nations due to his investment in arms factories. Simon, believing the words to be defamatory, sued in court. The trial opened today. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Barker, stated that since the lawsuit was filed, the defendant had apologized to Simon and retracted the statement. Simon did not want the defendant to pay damages or litigation costs. The purpose of his lawsuit was to prove the standard of British public life. He added that if anyone makes such unfounded statements in the future, they will be dealt with severely, probably in criminal court rather than civil court. Simon then stated that none of the defendant's words were true. Then, the defendant's lawyer apologized on behalf of his client. Finally, the presiding judge concluded the case, saying that he believed the British Foreign Secretary was lenient to the defendant. Such attacks on British politicians are truly outrageous.

<p>Telegram from Li Rong and Sheng Shicai</p>
<h3 id="e35">Detailing the Current Situation in Xinjiang Province <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei Send Telegrams of Comfort and Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Rong, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Sheng Shicai, Border Defense Commissioner, recently telegraphed stating that local newspapers had misunderstood or misrepresented the situation in Xinjiang province and provided clarification on the 15th. Upon receiving this telegram, the central authorities, headed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Jingwei, sent telegrams of comfort and instructions. Both telegrams are recorded as follows: (Li and Sheng's Telegram) Briefly stated, since the loss of the Northeast, the situation on the border has been precarious. Shicai and others, upon receiving orders from the central government, have worked hard to suppress the rebels and preserve the territory. This can be told to the people of the country without shame. However, recently, various newspapers in the interior have spread rumors about Xinjiang, making unwarranted accusations, fabricating stories, and confusing the public. Shicai and others are distraught and find it difficult to understand. The spread of rumors has little impact on individuals but greatly harms the border situation, causing those who are loyal to the party and the country to feel disappointed. This is regrettable. Furthermore, communication to Xinjiang is difficult, so the truth may not be clear. However, the facts are there and can be verified. Since the April 12th Incident (1927), for three years, all measures have been taken in accordance with the central government's political orders. Shicai, having learned from the past, is constantly vigilant against warlords dividing the land for their own selfish gain. During the departure of Jin Shuren, when the banditry was rampant and imperialists were manipulating the situation, causing ethnic conflicts and mutual killings, the number of disputes and the dangerous environment should be imagined by the people of the country. Shicai and others bear the responsibility of protecting the border and ensuring the safety of the people. We dare not take credit for the work of heaven, but we also bear the responsibility entrusted to us by the territory. However, the rumor-mongers accuse us of colluding with foreigners and engaging in treason. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? To make the people of the country understand the truth, we dare to absolutely declare that no country has a single soldier stationed in Xinjiang, no inch of land has been occupied by foreigners, and no organization does not comply with central government orders. As for the so-called treason and communication with foreign countries, we dare to use our personalities as collateral and swear that we have no other intentions. Only after destruction does construction begin. Due to the lack of talent, there is indeed a practice of hiring consultants. However, political orders come from the provincial government, and these personnel can only assist in planning and have no power to command various departments. As for the relationship between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, it is limited to commerce. Shicai, being aware of the times and knowing the situation, believes that restoring trade with the Soviet Union is beneficial to both breaking the deadlock and developing the economy. It should also be stated that the recently finalized contract between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union for a purely commercial loan is used for various production projects, such as agriculture, industry, commerce, and transportation. In the future, it will be gradually repaid by Xinjiang's local products. The central government is also doing its utmost to carry out the above projects and utilize foreign capital as a foundation, such as the recent cotton and wheat loan. Although the names are different, the uses are the same. Since it does not harm sovereignty and is supported by public opinion, why is there so much doubt and lack of sympathy from the outside world, leading to delays? It is regrettable. In short, Shicai and others know in our hearts that our duty is to gather the ethnic groups and do everything to protect the border and defend the territory, building from destruction and prospering from desolation. All measures are in accordance with central government orders. In order to overcome the current difficulties, we must only adhere to our original intentions to achieve success. However, the rumors in the interior do not occur when the entire Xinjiang is in chaos but when we are striving to govern and working hard. It is enough to hinder local development and create opportunities for the enemy. This is what Shicai and others earnestly hope the people of the country understand. The above is declared to heaven and earth. When Ambassador Yan goes to Russia and passes through Xinjiang, all misunderstandings will not be difficult to clarify at a glance. We dare to ask you to explain to avoid misunderstandings and to convey the truth to the authorities. We look up to Chairman Chiang and President Wang, who take it upon themselves to revive the country and see ten thousand miles ahead. With one word, they will be able to dispel all doubts. Then Xinjiang will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. (Chiang and Wang's Telegram) Briefly stated, Chairman Li Rong and Commissioner Sheng Shicai of Dihua (Ürümqi), I have received the telegrams of January 15th forwarded by Governor He Yingqin and the two chairmen and the pacification commissioners of various provinces. The content is sincere and deeply moving. Recalling that Xinjiang has been suffering from continuous turmoil, internal and external troubles, the two of you have held on tenaciously to pacify the local areas. Your efforts are deeply understood by us and are witnessed by the people of the country. Because the roads are distant and communication is cut off, rumors are passed around, leading to inaccuracies. Newspapers must record what they hear, and there may be one or two inaccurate records that are not intentional. We have strictly ordered the responsible authorities to instruct the newspaper offices to publish carefully to avoid confusion. Once traffic is restored and there is frequent communication, the truth will be clear and rumors will stop. The so-called facts speak louder than words. We hope that you both will take a broader view of the situation and not be concerned about trivial matters. This is what we earnestly hope for. Regarding the matters of consultants and loans, the central government takes them extremely seriously. All foreign consultants employed must be through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a copy of the employment contract must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing. For example, consultants employed by the Military Affairs Commission and the Economic Commission are all handled in accordance with legal procedures. Borrowing foreign loans must be approved by the administrative and central political meetings and reviewed by the Legislative Yuan before they are valid. The cotton and wheat loans from the previous year were all established through this procedure. The central government is still like this. Local governments have no precedents to follow. This is restricted by laws and regulations and is by no means intended to restrict Xinjiang. Xinjiang's position is special, and the situation is very different. It may be necessary to borrow materials from foreign countries. The central government understands this. However, since we know nothing about the facts and details, we cannot provide assistance. For example, regarding the loan, we previously received a telegram from your office to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry used the loan contract to review it. Since then, there has been no further mention from your office. Inquiring with the Soviet Russian Embassy here, they are also vague. It is not even certain whether there is a loan, let alone whether it has been approved. You must remember all these events. Now that you have mentioned it, we will also pay attention. Please send the names of the consultants, their nationality, age, position, salary, and term, as well as the full text of the loan contract, to the central government to complete the procedures. In short, the central government and the local government are one entity. Although mountains and rivers may obstruct, our feelings are connected. We hope that you will both work hard to overcome difficulties and jointly support the precarious situation. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) During the second reading of the draft Regulations on the Organization of the Xikang Province Establishment Committee at the Legislative Yuan on the 25th, Jiao Yitang first reported on the review process, and said that Article 2 of the original draft stated, "The area under the jurisdiction of the Xikang Province Establishment Committee shall be temporarily based on the administrative area of Xikang Province as determined by the Central Resolution in September of the 17th year." The case of the establishment of Xikang Province was proposed to the Central Government by Xue Dubi and others, and approved by the Central Political Council. However, the area under its jurisdiction was not specified in the original resolution. During the review, except for a slight modification of the wording of Article 1, the other parts of the original draft were largely appropriate, so there were not many deletions. Then Wei Tingsheng and others mainly changed the phrase "temporarily based on the administrative area of Xikang Province as determined by the Central Resolution in September of the 17th year" to "temporarily based on the established administrative area of Xikang Province." Di Ying and others believed that whether this article existed or not would not hinder the establishment of Xikang Province, and mainly proposed to delete it. The chairman put the deletion or amendment of this article to a vote, and everyone unanimously agreed to delete the article. There was little controversy over the other articles, and all were omitted and passed in the third reading. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Guangzhou Market Sluggish <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Lunar New Year Approaching, Finances Depleted</p>
<p>Treasury Certificates Used Instead of Cash for Settlement of Accounts</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The various stores here are affected by the sluggish market and the collapse of the rural economy. Those who are unable to support themselves have closed down one after another. Even those who can barely maintain the status quo feel that it is difficult to manage the settlement of accounts at the end of the lunar year. The loans released by the silver industry cannot be recovered because most of the stores have closed down. The amount of outstanding loans is about 80%. Therefore, cash is even more scarce. The Chamber of Commerce recently planned to borrow money from the Provincial Bank to seek relief, but credit loans cannot be processed at the Provincial Bank for the time being, and property loans are not being considered because the value of property has fallen sharply in recent years and no one is asking about property. Yesterday, the bank indicated that it was unable to lend money to the merchants. The City Chamber of Commerce had to notify the merchants to use commercial treasury certificates to help with the relief, and to approve the Finance Department to temporarily exempt 20% of the provincial currency for receiving commercial treasury certificates (ie, exempt 20% of the cash, and fully use property mortgage guarantees). The Economic Design Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce reported the case to the public at a meeting yesterday, stating that, according to the letter transferred by the City Chamber of Commerce to the Commercial Treasury Certificate Issuance Committee, the 32nd meeting of the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce decided that, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, for the sake of relieving the market, all settlements, whether using commercial treasury certificates in full or partly, the recipients should accept them. If they refuse to use them, please refer them to the Commercial Mediation Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce for mediation. At the same time, the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday formally notified the various trade associations to inform the stores that all account settlements in the market at the end of the year can use commercial treasury certificates instead of cash, and the recipients must not refuse. If problems arise, they can directly complain to the Commercial Mediation Committee for mediation and interpretation, so as to maintain the market and facilitate the settlement of accounts.

<h3 id="e62">The Disaster Situation in Various Counties in Western Shandong is Still Severe <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Floodwater Three or Four Feet Deep, Still Rising</p>
<p>More Than Twenty People Died in Fan County When Ice Floes Hit Boats</p>
<p>Shouzhang Representatives Arrive in Ji'nan to Request Exemption from Head Tax</p>
<p>Ji'nan Communication: The counties of Shouzhang, Shu'a, Yanggu, Fan County, Pu County, etc. in Western Shandong have suffered extremely severe disasters since the Yellow River Changyuan breached its banks in early July of last year, because the area is located between the Jindi and the Yellow River dikes. The floodwater has continued to rise. Up to now, the floodwater is still three or four feet deep in the plains, and has risen another foot recently. During the current ice flood season, the river channel is not flowing smoothly, and there is more overflow. Ice blocks are piled up like mountains. In Caojiazhuang, Dongguan, Fan County, a ferry boat was broken by ice floes the other day. Twenty-seven passengers fell into the water and were tragically drowned. Only three or four people were rescued, and the rest died. It is said to be tragic. In the autumn of last year, the disaster-stricken counties submitted reports to the provincial government, reporting the disaster situation and requesting exemption from head tax. The provincial government exempted Yanggu, Fan County, and Dong'a counties. However, Shouzhang was only allowed to be exempted by one-tenth. In fact, the disaster situation in Shouzhang is also extremely severe. The disaster area is more than 150 li long from east to west and 10 to 30 li wide from north to south. The Ji'nan Red Swastika Society sent personnel to Shouzhang in October of last year to allocate 5,000 yuan in disaster relief. Zhao Mingyuan, the commander of the First Route Militia, recently arrived in Shouzhang and saw that the disaster situation was extremely serious. He gave 4,000 yuan as relocation expenses for the people. More than 2,000 people have now registered. The severity of the tragedy can be imagined. However, the former county magistrate Wu Shouqi's report on the disaster situation was not detailed enough, so the provincial government only approved the exemption of one-tenth of the head tax. The current county magistrate Zhou Ziqin is urging the collection of the head tax very urgently, and the people are really unable to pay. Moreover, the current disaster situation is more serious than before. The disaster victims have no place to live and no food or clothing. The spring planting season is approaching, but the Yellow River water has not receded, and the farmers will have no hope in the future. Therefore, they specially elected ten representatives Wang Yufeng, Zhang Tongheng, Yang Xinzhi, Nie Huadong, Meng Guangrong, Hou Xifeng, Jiang Zungan, Sun Ruyin, Meng Zhaoshan, and Wu Yongxiang to Ji'nan to petition the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Finance, and the provincial government to approve the exemption of the head tax and request that the dike be closed as soon as possible to save the people in the disaster.

The homeowner, Wei Guihe, was startled awake from his sleep and hurriedly tried to escape onto the roof, intending to avoid them elsewhere. Unfortunately, he carelessly fell, injuring his left leg. The homeowner's wife, Zhu, heard the commotion and went outside to call for help, mistakenly arriving at Nan Ye by the Jing Port. The bandits pursued her relentlessly, and in the darkness, she fell into the river and drowned.

<p>Dispatching Troops to Protect Steamboat Passengers</p>
<p>As the end of the lunar year approaches, the county government believes that security is especially important during the customary year-end accounting period for businesses. Furthermore, this county is suffering from drought, and starving people are everywhere. Currently, in addition to working with the drought relief association to actively raise funds for spring relief, special attention is being paid to petty thieves and bandits during the winter defense period. Military forces have been assigned to various key towns for prevention. Now, steamboat managers have been summoned to the county government for discussions. Starting today, for a period of half a month, four security team soldiers will be assigned to each steamboat to provide protection along the way. The soldiers' food and lodging will be provided by the steamboat, and they are not allowed to make any other demands, in order to ensure the safety of travelers.

<p>丨Examination of Sino-Japanese Relations丨</p>
<p>1. Introduction 丨 The Stalemate Between China and Japan</p>
<p>There are already many papers discussing the Sino-Japanese problem. There are also many opinions expressed by politicians and scholars from both China and Japan, whether they are specialized or general. But I dare to say that very few people from both public and private sectors in both countries can truly consider the ultimate interests of the country regarding the Sino-Japanese problem, without being driven by emotions or politeness, or blinded by temporary errors. We can at least say that the positive understanding of the problem is really not enough. Many tragedies in the international community are caused by a temporary difference, which leads to irreparable disasters. In order to break the stalemate between China and Japan, to prevent it from becoming more and more hopeless, and to establish peace in East Asia and eliminate the chances of war, it is necessary to conduct an honest review of the Sino-Japanese problem, without avoiding or concealing anything, and to make an honest criticism.</p>
<p>I am not an expert in international politics. This article is based entirely on common sense and facts, and it is a purely objective statement of truth and reason for reflection by both China and Japan. I don't need to repeat what has already been discussed by general politicians, but this article will try to state as much as possible and without concealing anything that is generally ignored or avoided, whether I am guilty or not, let the readers decide.</p>
<p>First of all, I dare to say that most intelligent Chinese people know that the Japanese will not ultimately be our enemies, and that China must ultimately have the necessity of working hand in hand with Japan. This is the conclusion based on a thorough consideration of the general trend of the world and the past, present and future of China and Japan (if they do not perish together). I think there should be quite a few Japanese people who hold the same view. But so far, not only has the stalemate not been broken, and there is no sign of renewing relations between the two countries, but also no glimmer of dawn can be found, just delaying the problem and letting nature take its course. Mankind has progressed to the twentieth century, but it still cannot directly recognize the facts, but is covering up and lacking courage and sincerity, which is really confusing.</p>
<p>2. Explain the Advantages and Disadvantages of Prolonging the Stalemate from China's Standpoint</p>
<p>From China's perspective, the Chinese Nationalist Party is currently dominating Chinese politics. There is no doubt that the Nationalist Party should believe in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "If there were no Japan in East Asia, China would have been divided or jointly managed long ago." He also said, "From the day Japan mobilizes to the day it opens to attack China, it will take at most ten days. If China breaks off relations with Japan, Japan can destroy China within ten days." (Fifth Lecture on Nationalism) There are many other words in various speeches and documents that prove that China and Japan are interdependent and mutually beneficial if they cooperate, and both will lose if they are enemies. Originally, from the perspective of the general trend of the world, if China thinks from the long-term future, China and Japan should cooperate with each other and there is no reason to be enemies to the end. Although there are now many citizens who are motivated by the current hatred and are quite willing to perish with Japan, the authorities of the Chinese Nationalist Party, since they have assumed the heavy responsibility of national security, should think from the big picture and have a dignified plan to be loyal to the interests of the country. We certainly know that the initiative in the Sino-Japanese problem is entirely in Japan's hands. When Japan has no intention of easing the situation, China cannot ease it alone. However, the current policy of "resisting while negotiating" is really only enough to show the helplessness of the authorities. Now there is another kind of people who imagine what China will do when Russia, Japan, or the United States goes to war, or even when World War II breaks out, and therefore advocate that China should absolutely not participate in the war and should strictly maintain neutrality. However, everyone knows that once the war starts, China will never be able to maintain neutrality to the end. The most likely position will probably be not actively standing on one side, but opposing the other side, or it can be said that when one side forces us or destroys our neutrality, we will resist him at the expense of sacrifice. But this is still no different from joining the war, and this cannot maintain neutrality and is in a passive position of being forced to participate, which is of no benefit to China, and will inevitably fall into the most miserable situation. So I say that it is better to say that we should strictly maintain neutrality than to say that we are prepared to sacrifice and participate in the war. If we want to say that we are standing on one side to participate in the war, it is better to say that we are resisting the other side. Therefore, it can be seen that it is no different from a fool's dream for China to maintain neutrality in World War II or to hope to gain some benefits by taking advantage of the situation. I believe that the only way for China at present is to try its best to eliminate the chances of war. And if we want to eliminate the chances of war, we must at least find a solution to the Sino-Japanese problem, which is one of the reasons for causing the war. If the Sino-Japanese problem is solved, the world situation will change, and the war between Russia, the United States, and Japan may not happen. Even if there is still a war between Russia, Japan, or the United States, China can have a clear position, deal with it freely, and not be constrained in the slightest. Therefore, whether from the perspective of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the permanent interests of the country, or from the perspective of responding to the current international situation, China should by no means allow the Sino-Japanese stalemate to continue indefinitely without seeking a solution.</p>
<p>3. Considering for Japan, Explain the Advantages and Disadvantages of Prolonging the Stalemate</p>
<p>From Japan's perspective, from the September 18th Incident to the present, from Uchida to Hirota, from the occupation of the four northeastern provinces, the subsequent withdrawal from the League of Nations, to the tough statement on April 17 last year, and to the present, although there have been repeated verbal slogans of "promoting and maintaining peace in East Asia," what they have done has been to increase the crisis of peace in East Asia, and they have been actively pursuing their tough policy towards China, and there is no sign of change. We certainly know that since Japan threw such an amazing bomb at China and the world three years ago, it is now going straight forward under some kind of ideal, whether it wants to or not. The country's politicians and military departments have their own plans for the world and China, or their own plans are very detailed. However, as outsiders, we can at least say that Japan's plans are not foolproof in terms of its strategy towards China. When discussing Japan's relations with China, we must also discuss its intricate relations with Russia, the United States (and Britain). On the one hand, because Japan wants to carry out its continental policy and the ideal of dominating the Pacific, defeating its powerful enemies, and unifying East Asia, it has aroused the jealousy of Russia and the United States. On the other hand, what the Japanese authorities use to deceive their people is that if they do not acquire Manchuria and Mongolia, they will not be able to eliminate the threat to Japan's national defense. In other words, Japan must manage Manchuria and Mongolia in order to prepare for war against Russia and the United States. We are now also taking a purely objective attitude to consider for Japan. Internationally, whether in terms of strategy or political strategy, in addition to the front, we should of course also consider the side and the back. If there are enemies on the side and back, and if the military strength of these enemies is used properly, it can be more effective than two, three, or even ten times the strength on the front. This is well known to any political strategist or strategist in the world. Now, if Japan wants to start a war with the United States to the east, China is on its back. If it wants to start a war with the Soviet Union to the north, China is on its side. Therefore, if Japan wants to prepare for war against the United States and Russia, if it does not eliminate the concerns on the side and back, it will not only have no chance of winning, but it will not even be possible to start a war. However, there are two ways to eliminate the concerns on the side and back. One way is to absolutely control this neighboring country with force so that it cannot cause trouble. The other way is to form a harmonious relationship with this neighboring country on the side and back. Now that the Japanese are not cooperating with China from the harmonious aspect, Japan's plan is obviously to take the method of controlling China by force. However, can Japan absolutely achieve the goal of controlling China? Moreover, in our opinion, since the relations between China and Japan have deteriorated to this point, it is not enough to just control China, but it must completely destroy China before it starts a war against the United States or Russia. If Japan cannot destroy China within ten days as Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, Japan's position is very dangerous. Because if Japan takes three months or half a year to destroy China, the United States or Russia will definitely not sit idly by and wait for Japan to deal with China calmly, and will force Japan to fight a quick battle. However, based on our observation of the facts, Japan has occupied the Northeast for three years. Not only can the Northeast Volunteer Army not be eliminated, but how can the civilian guns in Shenyang County be collected as scheduled? Based on this fact, can Japan after all completely control China or even destroy China in the shortest period of time, such as within ten days? As for why Mr. Sun Yat-sen clearly stated that Japan can destroy China within ten days, it should be known that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words were to see through Japan's ambition and possibility to occupy important places in China within ten days, so he especially emphasized his words to warn the Chinese people. He also knew very well that Japan can only occupy important transportation areas in China within ten days, but cannot destroy China's 4.5 million square miles of land and 480 million people? Now that we understand this meaning, we can observe from various facts and situations whether Japan has the possibility of completely controlling China or destroying China?</p>
<p>(1) In terms of controlling China, Japan must of course first use its naval power to blockade China's coast. However, China is still in a semi-colonial status, and European and American countries have intricate political and economic relations with China, especially Britain's relations are even closer, which is not just related to the interests of one or two countries. If Japan wants to do this, it will not only be an enemy of China, but also an enemy of Russia and the United States, and will force Britain and the whole world to be enemies. Originally, controlling the coast of China was for the convenience of fighting against Russia or the United States, but before the main battle has begun, it has expanded the scope of hostility to the whole world. Is this a beneficial strategy? This is in terms of the sea.</p>
<p>(2) On the land side, what we can believe that Japan is actively planning is to create the second and third "Manchukuo," that is, what is generally said to expand the scope of aggression to create the so-called "North China Country" or "Mongolia Country." But is this allowed by Japan's power? First of all, in terms of economy, how much military expenditure has Japan spent since it sent troops to Manchuria to create the "puppet state"? This is well known to the world, and the continuous increase in the amount of fiscal deficit in the country is also well known to the world. Now, if it expands the scope of aggression, it must be known that managing North China will definitely not be as easy as seizing the three northeastern provinces. First, the incident happened unprepared, and second, the people's morale and strength in North China and the level of people's knowledge are also different from those in the three northeastern provinces who have been under Japanese influence for a long time. If Japan really wants to create the second and third puppet organizations in North China or Mongolia that it imagines, the military strength consumed and the expenses incurred will definitely be doubled compared with the past. And in areas such as Inner Mongolia, the wilderness is barren, with little production and no income at all. If it insists on managing it, it will cost twice as much. This is in terms of its direct economic impact. In terms of indirect impact, if Japan must further expand the scope of aggression, the Chinese people's boycott movement will not be suppressed by any force. At that time, whether Japan still has commercial or other industries that can stand in China is not difficult to imagine. Furthermore, in terms of military affairs and the required military strength, first take "Manchukuo" as an example. The Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo" are said to be five divisions on the surface, but in fact we know that there are more than 100,000 people. With more than 100,000 troops, they still cannot ensure the so-called "Manchukuo" The security within the territory is constantly threatened by the Volunteer Army. Then, if Japan wants to create the same second and third pseudo-organizations as "Manchukuo," it must send at least 200,000 troops to deal with it. The total number of Japanese regular troops is only 17 divisions. Even if all of them are transferred, it will not be enough. The maintenance and suppression of security in the country and Korea also require considerable military strength. At this point, it will inevitably conscript reserve and reserve soldiers. In this way, Japan will be formally at war with China; and being formally at war with China is not what I said above, just controlling the area in northern China. In this way, it will take the supporting battlefield as the main battlefield, and it will completely abandon its main enemy. If Japan takes this wrong step, it will be doomed to its own demise. China will not be afraid of this kind of meaningful sacrifice, and will rather be happy to accept it without hesitation.</p>
<p>(3) If Japan officially uses troops against China for any reason, China's military strength is not as good as Japan's, and it will inevitably suffer great sacrifices. This is something that Chinese people cannot deny. However, Japan's difficulty lies in this. It is precisely because China has no strength that it is its strength that cannot be easily insulted. When a war begins, in countries with equal strength, the final battle is the end of the war. However, in countries with absolutely unequal military strength, such as Japan fighting against China, there is no such thing as a formal final battle. It will not be the end of the war until Japan can occupy every square mile of China's land and completely destroy China. When the two countries start a war, it is essential to occupy the political center. However, when fighting against China, if the capital is occupied by force, it will not be able to control China's fate. (Because China is still in the period of unfinished revolution, which will be discussed in detail below) At most, Japan can only occupy some cities with convenient transportation and important seaports in China, but it can never occupy all of China's 4.5 million square miles. When all the important cities and seaports in China are occupied, China will indeed fall into extreme distress and sacrifice. However, how can Japan completely eliminate China's existence? Even if the four northeastern provinces are occupied as an example, China's loss of this important territory is of course an extremely serious loss. However, from the perspective of the nature of the National Government in the revolutionary period, temporary gains and losses are almost irrelevant, and it is rather a blessing in disguise. Because we have heard the authorities of the Chinese Nationalist Party say: "The revolutionary party should of course be responsible for recovering the Northeast, but the revolutionary party is not responsible for losing the Northeast." The author is not a member of the Nationalist Party, and I do not want to say whether this statement is a self-justification of the Nationalist Party. In fact, before the September 18th Incident, the Northeast was only nominally under the National Government, and the military, political, and financial powers were completely independent. At least it can be said that it was not within the scope of the revolutionary forces. However, in the past, it was only nominal, but now it has even lost its name. However, although it seems to have fallen, in fact, since the Northeast was occupied, the Northeast Army has been completely unified under the central government, and the people of the Northeast have thoroughly recognized the meaning of nationalism, and spiritually are more closely under the unified China. Based on this evidence, it can be known that if Japan continues to invade and reduce China's territory as a good plan, the result will only be to make China follow the example of Turkey when it abandoned Europe and retreated to Asia, shorten the front line, and try its best to fight for survival. At that time, the lives of the people of the two countries will be sacrificed, and the tragedy cannot be predicted. However, can Japan ultimately achieve the goal of completely destroying China after the war?</p>
<p>Based on the above points. It can be seen that whether Japan is preparing for war against Russia and the United States, or carrying out its traditional continental policy of 50 years ago, and using military force to oppress or invade China, from Japan's standpoint, it is definitely an attempt with great sacrifice and no guarantee. In other words, whether it is controlling China or destroying China, it is impossible. As for the international community's condemnation and Japan's internal crisis, I don't need to say more in this article. There are also many people of insight in Japan who are very worried about Japan's future. However, in my opinion, Japan really has no reason to go its own way to the end. If it puts aside its prejudices and recognizes the facts, and wants to change its course, then it will be back on the right path.</p>
<p>The formation of great mistakes in the international community has both primary and secondary causes. Often, it is not only one party that has made mistakes, but both parties must have their own mistakes. Looking back at the period from before and after the September 18th Incident to the present, whether it is the Chinese side or the Japanese side, they all have their own errors in their understanding of the general situation and of each other, as well as in their measures. Some of these errors have become past, and some continue to follow the wrong path and constantly create new errors. Since this article wants to honestly review Sino-Japanese relations, it should of course point out all the errors on both sides, and then it can determine the path to be taken to solve the problem.

<p>Seeking Chinese Members</p>
<p>Huang Xianzhao Appointed as Chinese Vice-President</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the World Press Congress was founded in 1915 by American press leaders and has continued for nearly twenty years. It has convened journalists from various countries in San Francisco, Honolulu, Geneva, and Mexico City, achieving significant results. The next congress was originally scheduled to be held in Melbourne, Australia, in March of this year. However, the organizers are now aiming to expand the congress and plan to first hold a large-scale membership drive to strengthen its foundation before convening the congress. In China, the congress has invited Mr. Huang Xianzhao to serve as the Chinese Vice-President, responsible for recruiting Chinese members. Mr. Huang, believing that the Chinese press may not be fully aware of the congress's history and mission, has provided a summary of the congress's history and regulations for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e75">History of the Congress <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Under the leadership of its president, Mr. Bell, the World Press Congress is currently undergoing reorganization and expansion in terms of membership and work. The next congress, originally scheduled for the latter part of March this year, has been postponed to allow ample time and opportunity for the congress to develop. The congress is now adding vice-presidents, who are being nominated based on the national and political boundaries of various countries around the world. There are currently seventy-five vice-presidents, all of whom are enthusiastic supporters and dedicated collaborators, and are working hard to recruit members for this grand endeavor. The congress offers three types of membership: individual membership, for anyone working in the press, regardless of nationality or job title, with annual dues of US$5; corporate membership, for newspapers, magazines, and specialized publications issued by businesses, with annual dues of US$50; and basic membership, for major news agencies, daily newspapers, and news distribution organizations around the world, with annual dues of US$100 or an amount approved by the Executive Committee. All members are entitled to all the benefits of the congress, such as attending meetings, discussing congress affairs, participating in voting, and receiving congress publications. The World Press Congress was founded in 1915 and has held meetings in San Francisco, Honolulu, Geneva, and Mexico City. Representatives from twenty to thirty countries have participated in the meetings, engaging in frank discussions on various issues related to the press. All resolutions and meeting records are printed and distributed to the members. Overall, the achievements of the congress can be summarized as: (1) promoting communication among press workers from various countries and jointly discussing various issues; (2) facilitating the reduction of news cable rates; (3) assisting journalists imprisoned in countries where freedom of speech is restricted, to ensure fair trials; (4) promoting journalism education; (5) supporting the circulation of international news; (6) supporting the exchange of newspaper reporters, journalists, and professors and students of journalism schools in various countries; (7) planning a journalist accreditation system, and so on. In addition, there are various new plans being considered, such as requesting governments to recognize foreign correspondents, appointing press attachés to embassies and consulates, improving newspaper standards, investigating press issues, and advocating for freedom of speech. The congress will also publish regular reports and maintain close contact with vice-presidents in various countries. The current address of the congress is Jay of Neff Hall, Missouri, USA. The sole purpose of the congress is, as Honorary President Dr. William has stated, to enhance the well-being and service of journalists and the press around the world. Therefore, all the officers of the congress welcome assistance, criticism, and suggestions from all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Articles of Association <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The articles of association of the Congress are listed as follows: Article 1: The name of this association is the World Press Congress. Article 2: The purpose of this association is to promote the mission of the press through all honest means, using meetings, discussions, and cooperation. The Congress meetings may discuss various issues directly related to the press, but may not discuss religion, politics, or government policies. Article 3: Any person from any country engaged in the press, whose work promotes the highest standards and greatest benefits of the press, may become a member of this association.

<p>Gu Xin Yi and Others Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Reportedly the Exchange Tax Will Be Postponed for One Year</p>
<p>Tax Rate to Be Based on Ad Valorem, Securities Tax Determined to Be Completely Exempted</p>
<p>Stamp Tax One in Ten Thousand, Yarn, Flour, and Grains One in Ten Thousand</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, Gu Xin Yi, Shao Wenmei, Zhan Liansheng, Wang Jiafu, and other representatives from the five exchanges in this city who attended the Legislative Yuan's review meeting in Beijing, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning on the Beijing-Shanghai express train. The Da Gong She reporter interviewed Mr. Gu Xin Yi, chairman of the Grains Exchange, yesterday to inquire about the review meeting. He provided the following details:</p>
<h3 id="e78">Satisfactory Results from Vigorous Advocacy at the Meeting <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>I (Gu referring to himself), along with all the representatives from the five exchanges, traveled to Beijing on the 23rd of this month and arrived in Beijing early the next morning. After resting at the hotel, we immediately went to the Legislative Yuan to attend the meeting. The agenda of the Economic and Financial Committees' review meeting stipulated that the representatives of the Ministry of Finance would report on their tax collection proposals in the morning, with Mr. Xu Kan, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, presenting the report in three points (the content was reported in yesterday's newspaper). The formal review meeting was held in the afternoon, allowing representatives from each exchange to attend. Fifty to sixty legislators participated in the review that day. Each exchange vigorously argued against the imposition of a transaction tax, given the business conditions and the depressed state of industry and commerce. The atmosphere at the meeting was very tense. The representatives from the exchanges, bearing the overall mission, seized this final opportunity to gather various facts and make the strongest possible arguments. Fortunately, the two committees of the Legislative Yuan were sympathetic to the difficulties of businesses, and the results were quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Tax Rate Based on Ad Valorem, Postponed for One Year <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The transaction tax, as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, was divided into two types: "ad valorem" and "specific duty." It was also planned that after being reviewed and passed by the Legislative Yuan, it would be implemented starting from February 1. As a result of the vigorous advocacy of the representatives from the five exchanges, the original plan to use "specific duty" as the standard for cotton, cotton yarn, flour, grains, wheat, soybeans, red sorghum, bean cake, bean oil, and other items was uniformly changed to "ad valorem" for calculating taxes. As for the official start date of tax collection, the representative of the Ministry of Finance acknowledged a one-year postponement. However, the representatives of the exchanges believed that the social and economic situation in recent years has been depressed and industry and commerce have been declining. It is difficult to predict whether industry and commerce will turn around and prosper after one year. They still advocated for an indefinite postponement, and that the tax should only be levied if the business of the exchanges truly improves. This is now being decided by five legislators. However, the one-year postponement has already been agreed to by the Ministry of Finance and should not be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Securities Exempted from All Taxes, Reduced Burden <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the taxes on the five exchanges for gold, securities, cotton cloth, flour, and grains, the tax rates proposed by the Ministry of Finance were: 0.0125% for securities, approximately 0.01% for stamp tax per transaction, approximately 0.025% for cotton cloth, and approximately 0.06-0.07% for flour and grains. During the review meeting of the Legislative Yuan, it was argued that the securities with value (i.e., public bonds) are all issued by the central and local governments, and taxing them in the same way would adversely affect the future of the public bond market. Most legislators advocated for exemption. The review also led to a reduction in the stamp tax rate from 0.01% to 0.001%, and a reduction in the tax rate for cotton cloth from 0.025% and for flour and grains from 0.06-0.07% to 0.01%. The principles have been initially determined and are unlikely to change.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Five Legislators Appointed to Conduct Investigation <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>In order to understand the business conditions of each exchange and as a basis for the review, the Economic and Financial Committees of the Legislative Yuan appointed five legislators, Chen Changheng, Chen Jianru, Zheng Hongnian, Zhang Zhihan, and Liu Zhendong, to conduct an investigation. The initial review was originally scheduled for this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). All representatives of the exchanges were prepared to stay in Beijing to make further statements. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan notified that due to procedural issues, it was postponed to tomorrow (i.e., today). We (Gu referring to himself), due to the Chinese New Year and the complexity of various affairs, have returned to Shanghai first. Mu Ouchu, Zhang Weiru, Xu Busun, and the representatives of the brokers' associations of each exchange will likely return to Shanghai after attending the initial review meeting of the five legislators.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Second Review to Be Held Next Month <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The second review meeting of the Economic and Financial Committees of the Legislative Yuan has been decided to be held in two weeks. It is not yet confirmed whether the appointed five legislators will come to Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation of each exchange. The Exchange Federation will convene a joint meeting with the brokers' associations after the representatives return to Shanghai to collect information on the business conditions and financial status of the past three years and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Zhejiang Province's Two Million Loan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Banks Made Payments Yesterday</p>
<p>Funds Have Been Fully Transferred to the Finance Department by Bank of China</p>
<p>Pledged Public Bonds Given to Respective Borrowing Banks for Safekeeping</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the Zhejiang Provincial Government used local public bonds of 3.34 million, discounted to borrow 2 million from Bank of China and other Shanghai banks as collateral. The loan contract, after being approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government's meeting, was sent to Shanghai on the 23rd and distributed by Bank of China, the representative of the syndicate, to each borrowing bank for signing. The respective borrowing banks had transferred the amount they subscribed to Bank of China at one time starting at 9:00 AM yesterday to be transferred to the Zhejiang Finance Department for receipt. Details of each situation are noted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e84">Funds Transferred Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, each borrowing bank transferred the amount they subscribed to Bank of China at one time. The bank then transferred the funds to its Hangzhou branch to be directly transferred to the Finance Department for receipt. The amounts are as follows: Bank of China 610,000, Bank of Communications 320,000, Zhejiang Industrial Bank 186,000, Zhejiang Industrial Corporation 160,000, Bank of Shanghai 120,000, China Industrial Bank, Sze Ming Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Continental Bank, and Jin Cheng Bank 80,000 each, Ken Yip Bank and Chung Nam Bank 70,000 each, and Salt Bank 64,000, totaling 2 million. When the Zhejiang Finance Department received the funds, it handed over Zhejiang local public bonds with a face value of 3.34 million from 1934 to the syndicate representatives for distribution to each borrowing bank for safekeeping.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Change of Use <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Finance Department originally intended to use public bonds with a face value of 10 million as collateral for 6 million for use. However, with the Chinese New Year approaching, the banks only agreed to lend 2 million first. Therefore, the original intended use of 6 million and the allocation of funds has now been changed as follows: (1) 1 million for construction expenses; (2) 500,000 for government expenses; (3) the remaining 500,000 will be used to pay off various miscellaneous debts.</p>

<p>Factory Site Decided to Be in Hangzhou</p>
<p>According to the Guomin She, Zhejiang gentry Chen Qinshi and Xu Jisheng, in view of the large-scale dumping of artificial silk in China, which has led to a sharp decline in the Chinese silk business, which is on the verge of collapse, have joined with gentry and merchants in Hangzhou and Huzhou to launch a large-scale artificial silk factory. Financial circles in Shanghai have also agreed to invest. A meeting was held to discuss implementation methods. It was decided that the factory site would be in Hangzhou, and it would also employ unemployed silk factory workers. Another meeting will be held soon to discuss all the specific methods.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Private Postal Bureaus Have Virtually Ceased Operations <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Reorganization Into Transport Bureaus Considered Impossible by Peers</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Is Discussing Relief Measures for Employees</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, the peak seasons for private postal bureaus to receive private letters are during the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Chinese New Year. Each bureau would work extra shifts to deliver them. During each New Year, factories, shops, or individuals sending silver dollar packages, letters, and so on are even more crowded than usual. Since the Ministry of Communications ordered them to cease operations last year and began intercepting letters in January of this year, private postal bureaus have disappeared. The allowed sending of silver dollar packages, etc., is also impossible to receive due to the inconvenience of carrying letters. With the Chinese New Year approaching, business has completely stopped. More than sixty private postal bureaus in the northern and southern districts and the concessions of this city have virtually declared their closure.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Reorganization: After the Ministry of Communications' order not to extend the closure deadline reached Shanghai, some letter merchants in this city, in order to find a way to maintain their livelihoods, planned to reorganize into transport bureaus, specializing in remittances of silver dollar packages, cargo, and so on. The principle was decided by the general representative, Yin Yuantong, and others in a meeting, and letters were sent to peers in various places to solicit opinions. According to the replies from most letter merchants, they believe it is practically difficult. The reasons are: (1) all remittances or entrusted packages and cargo must be accompanied by letters. Now that private letters are not allowed to be delivered, reorganization into transport bureaus is also futile, and senders are unwilling to take this extra step; (2) the business scope and nature of transport bureaus are completely different from those of private postal bureaus, and their financial strength must be sufficient to proceed. Moreover, sending silver dollar packages, etc., without accompanying letters is prone to malpractice and involves great risk.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Relief: The national private postal bureaus previously requested the central government to withdraw its order to ban private postal bureaus. The General Assembly of General Representatives was fully authorized to handle this. Now that the Ministry of Communications has replied that it cannot be salvaged, and reorganization into transport bureaus is difficult, most representatives have dispersed and left Shanghai. Regarding the relief of more than a thousand employees in this city, the municipal government has previously ordered the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus to conduct a thorough investigation and propose relief measures for the government to review. It is now heard that the points agreed upon by the two bureaus regarding employee relief have been submitted to the municipal government for proper handling.</p>

<p>Materials Arrived in Shanghai, Construction Has Begun</p>
<p>Expected to Be in Operation Before Double Ten Day This Year</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, in order to facilitate communication between Shanghai and Guangdong, the Ministry of Communications has decided to build a wireless telephone system between Shanghai and Guangdong. It has commissioned the China Electric Company to purchase a large number of wireless telephone materials from the United Kingdom, which have all arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 100 pieces. They are currently stored at the Zhenru International Radio Station.</p>
<p>Construction Has Begun: The Ministry of Communications has chosen Zhenru because of its vast land and convenient transportation. Therefore, the Shanghai station for the Shanghai-Guangdong wireless telephone has been surveyed and decided to be built there. Construction has begun in recent days. In Guangzhou, the local communications authorities have also ordered construction. Meanwhile, Mr. Sparg, manager of the China Electric Company, has been commissioned by the Ministry of Communications to inspect the progress of the project in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Operation in October: The total construction cost of the entire project, with all the machines and components being high-quality materials from abroad, is estimated to be 700,000 yuan, one of the largest electrical projects in China in recent years. It is expected to be in operation before Double Ten Day this year. However, if the project is subject to unexpected obstacles, it may be delayed until next spring before it can be officially put into operation.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Famine Relief Association <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Held Sixth Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Formed Seed Preparation and Distribution Research Committee</p>
<p>More Than 100,000 Yuan Raised in City-Wide Donations</p>
<p>The All-Provinces Famine Relief Association held its sixth meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. More than twenty people attended, including Xu Shiying.</p>
<p>Chairman Xu Shiying Reported: 1. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter requesting assistance for 165 Hunan famine refugees, including Wang Zuoqing, to return to their hometowns. 264 silver dollars were allocated. 144 Jiangxi famine refugees, including Liu Liji, and 31 Hebei famine refugees, including Liu Zhutian, were also assisted to return to their hometowns, with 234 yuan and 80 cents being allocated. 2. The association appointed Baker as an advisor, Jin Shaowu as deputy director, Yang Zigong as director of investigation and distribution in Hebei Province, Gao Haifeng and Sun Xianqing as deputy directors, Li Zizhong as director of investigation and distribution in Henan Province, Guo Fangwu as deputy director, Feng Yangshan as observer in Zhejiang, and Cheng Yiqing as inspector in Jiangsu, requesting ratification. 3. Regarding the association's telegram requesting the implementation of the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law, the Ministry of Finance replied that it plans to postpone the proposed "allocation of seeds starting from January 1, 1931" in the original draft until 1935 to ensure comprehensive consideration. In addition to consulting with the Ministry of Interior to revise, it will be submitted to the Ministry for countersigning and distributed to the departments for review, replying for reference. The directors of investigation and distribution in various provinces reported on the progress of their work.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: Regarding how to prepare and distribute seeds for spring plowing in disaster areas, it was decided to appoint Huang Bodu, Huang Hanzhi, Li Dachao, Huang Yinzhou, Baker, Chu Huiseng, Jin Shaowu, Guan Chouzhi, and eight others to form a Seed Preparation and Distribution Research Committee, and to designate Chu Huiseng to convene it. Regarding the remaining sixteen famine relief requests, it was decided to wait until funds are available for distribution.</p>
<p>Donations: The representative of the municipal government, Li Dachao, reported that the 100,000 yuan or so in disaster relief funds obtained from the city-wide donations last year was entrusted by Mayor Wu to be reported to this association and immediately handed over to the association for use. However, since these relief funds were raised during the city-wide donations with equal emphasis on bandit and drought disasters, the distribution of the relief funds should still be based on the principle of equal division between bandit and drought disasters. This is now included with an attached statement.</p>
<p>Xu Talks About Agricultural Relief: According to Mr. Xu Shiying, the severity of the disasters in various provinces last year was unprecedented. The methods of preparing and distributing relief funds are that, in addition to labor-based relief being handled by the provincial authorities themselves by issuing public bonds, emergency relief is initiated by various charitable organizations and agencies in Shanghai to form this association for handling. These two types have now been gradually implemented. The last one is agricultural relief. Although the central government also pays close attention to agricultural relief, the disaster areas in various provinces have suffered severe disasters, and there is no grass on the farmland, let alone seeds. Now that winter is passing and spring is approaching, the need for seeds is very urgent. This association's preparation and distribution of seeds is of great significance and mission. Now that there is a research committee to design it, it may be able to do its best to design for the farmers.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Emergency Relief Donations Committee previously entrusted newspapers, banks, money shops, companies, stores, Chinese and Western pharmacies, restaurants, and movie theaters to solicit donations, achieving excellent results. The second phase of settlement will be at the end of this month. Donations being submitted to the committee have been reported in various newspapers.

<p>Will Soon Visit Committee Chairman Xu to Plead for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Huangshan in Southern Anhui, once obscure due to inconvenient transportation, has gained prominence since the opening of the Hangzhou-Huizhou highway. The Anhui Provincial Government, appreciating the mountain's serene scenery, decided to develop it into a scenic area for tourism. Consequently, the Huangshan Construction Committee was established, with Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Relief Commission, appointed as the Chairman, responsible for planning and construction. After a year of work, the highway from She County to the foot of the mountain was opened to traffic after the Double Tenth Festival last year. This road connects to the Hangzhou-Huizhou, Wuhu-Tunxi, and other roads, allowing travelers from Nanjing, Wuhu, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to make day trips. Thus, Huangshan became widely known. Unexpectedly, after the onset of winter, the Red bandits entrenched in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces were routed by the National Army and scattered. Among them, two groups led by Luo Binghui and Fang Zhimin fled along the Zhejiang border to southern Anhui, invading Huangshan. Consequently, all villages, large and small, within the mountain were devastated. Wherever the bandits went, homes were turned to ashes. The slightly wealthier villagers managed to escape elsewhere, but the majority of farmers, lacking resources, had to take their elderly and children to hide in the deep mountains and valleys. The plight of the displaced was beyond description. Although the bandits who entered the mountain have now fled, scattered soldiers still appear from time to time, preventing those who sought refuge from daring to return quickly. The villages are deserted, and the scene is desolate. Adding to the hardship, a severe drought last summer resulted in a complete failure of the autumn harvest. Following a disastrous year, the people suffered banditry. Countless villagers died by the sword or were left to perish in ditches. Recently, She County Magistrate Shi posted public notices throughout the villages to reassure the people. However, the food and clothing of the general farmers had already been looted by the bandits, and their utensils were destroyed. Returning would mean starvation or freezing to death. Moreover, rumors have not subsided, and alarms are still frequent.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people still live in makeshift shelters in the mountains, sleeping in caves, gathering ferns to stave off hunger, and using thatch for warmth. The village chiefs and Baojia heads, originally local intellectuals, were the most targeted by the bandits. Apart from those who escaped in advance, many were killed by the bandits. With the villages lacking leadership, it is even more difficult to resettle the displaced. Xie Benli, the Bao chief of Yang Village, styled Yipu, is known for his enthusiasm for local public welfare. Due to the severe bandit and drought disasters suffered by his village and surrounding villages, and witnessing the widespread suffering in this harsh winter, he came to Shanghai yesterday to plead for relief from Relief Committee Chairman Xu on behalf of the disaster victims, appealing for help to rescue the remaining people after the calamity and repair the devastation in the villages. Last summer, Xu visited the mountain to inspect the Huangshan construction. At that time, the desolation was not yet complete, and the bandit atmosphere had not yet arrived. However, the mountain villages' economy was already bankrupt, and the livelihood of the mountain people was already showing signs of exhaustion. Now, with repeated disasters, the people's lives are unbearable. Therefore, if you want to build Huangshan and prosper southern Anhui, the most important task at present is to appease the displaced and provide emergency relief to alleviate the suffering of the survivors. Xu has always been compassionate and concerned about the suffering of others. Therefore, he will surely express sympathy for Xie's efforts and appeals and generously provide relief supplies. Xie plans to visit the Shanghai office of the Relief Commission in the coming days to present the tragic situation of the affected villages in the mountain and plead for the lives of tens of thousands of disaster victims.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association, for the purpose of raising relief funds for disaster victims, yesterday sent a letter to temples and monasteries in the city. The original letter stated: "To all temples and monasteries in Shanghai, last year's drought spread across various provinces, famine occurred frequently, and deaths followed one after another. The suffering of the disaster victims is like being hung upside down. Who among us is not a Buddhist disciple? How can we bear to sit idly by and watch them suffer in the burning house? All of us believers should urgently respond to the principle of 'same body, great compassion.' Recently, Dharma Master Hongsan, taking advantage of providing relief in Anhui, sent a letter from the front describing the tragic situation of the disaster victims, which is unbearable to witness. Now in the harsh winter, the need for funds is even more urgent. Therefore, we hereby notify all temples and monasteries in the city to quickly donate and raise funds if you have not already done so for this disaster relief effort, and send them to our association for forwarding to the disaster relief committee. Those who have already donated should also send the amount and date of the donation, as well as the relief organization to which it was sent, in a list to our association for verification. This is extremely important."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Red Swastika Society Relief Teams Working in Guangchang <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the first and second relief teams of the Red Swastika Society arrived in Jiangxi, they were quickly divided into groups and dispatched to areas in Guangchang, Ningdu, and Hengfeng to carry out relief work. It is now learned that the Jiangxi Relief Headquarters of the Society has reviewed the report on the work situation from Zhao Yulin, the captain of the second team in Guangchang. The following excerpts are provided: 1. Corpses are scattered throughout the disaster area. There are especially many exposed bones along the banks of the Sha River. Personnel have been dispatched to supervise laborers to collect and bury the exposed bones in groups and to cover the floating graves in various places with soil. Fifty to sixty such sites have already been completed. However, the manpower is insufficient, and there are no strong men available for hire locally. It is urgently hoped that an additional burial team will be sent to complete this epidemic prevention work in the shortest possible time. 2. Epidemics are rampant in Guangchang, and deaths are occurring one after another. The people in the disaster area are unable to collect the bodies and often leave them in ditches, which is extremely tragic. Our team has prepared coffins for distribution. In recent days, more than thirty-five coffins have been distributed. 3. The clinic opened on the tenth of this month. More than three hundred people are seeking medical attention every day. Most of the illnesses are malaria, dysentery, and athlete's foot. There are also many cases of typhoid fever. The disaster victims who come to the clinic are suffering from both hunger and illness. Their groans and cries are extremely pitiful. 4. The disaster area of Guangchang is divided into six districts. One team member has been dispatched to each district to investigate with the district office. Relief rice will be distributed immediately, and three thousand cotton-padded coats will be allocated, with five hundred coats distributed to each district. Those who are extremely impoverished will be selected for early distribution. After receiving the above report, the Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society received telegrams from Presidents Zhou Chongguang and Wang Huazan one after another, urging the dispatch of burial teams to set off quickly. It is reported that the office has telegraphed Zhou Genjing, the president of the Anqing branch, to quickly transfer more than twenty members of the Wuwei burial team to leave for the front to work.</p>

<p>Organization of the Chongqi Co-Governance Promotion Association</p>
<p>Second Board Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Rules and Preface Passed</p>
<p>Shanghai News reports that the Chongming Sojourning Shanghai Students Association, in order to carry out the Chongqi co-governance movement, convened its second board meeting yesterday afternoon and passed the preface and organizational rules. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Board Meeting Attendees: Yang Zhenzhong, Shi Chongpeng, Song An, Chen Dongbai, Tong Muge, Lu Yinpu, Chen Xiangxin, Gong Pixiong, etc. Chairman: Yang Zhenzhong. Recorder: Chen Dongbai. Matters discussed: (1) Determining the organizational name of the Chongqi co-governance movement. Resolved: The name will be the Chongqi Co-Governance Promotion Committee. (2) Passing the organizational rules and preface of the Promotion Committee. (3) Appointing Director Shi Chongpeng to be responsible for drafting the declaration of the Promotion Committee's establishment. (4) Setting the establishment meeting for 1:00 PM on February 10th at Minli Girls' High School. (5) Appointing Cao Yinqiu as an honorary director of the Association.</p>
<p>Preface Chongqi's separation has lasted for seven years. The residents have opposed it from the beginning and have petitioned for correction for seven years. The reasons for the opposition are: first, the residents' consent was not obtained; second, the burden on the people was ignored, and taxes were increased; and third, Chongming has suffered huge damage, while Qidong has achieved no construction results. Numerous documents have been disclosed over the years, and those who have seen them know the details, and those who have heard them are familiar with them. Last November, Provincial Chairman Chen had already submitted a meeting decision to the heads of the four departments of civil affairs, finance, education, and construction for review. The head of the Department of Civil Affairs convened a meeting on the matter. It is hoped that this matter will be resolved, but the timing is uncertain. However, the damage has lasted for seven years. Our colleagues living abroad are deeply concerned about our hometown and hope that the co-governance will be resolved as soon as possible so that local affairs can be sorted out as soon as possible. Therefore, promoting Chongqi co-governance is a matter of great urgency. The Association has initiated the organization of the Chongqi Co-Governance Promotion Committee to be responsible for carrying it out, striving for its success, and ensuring that the fragmented situation can be restored to its former state as soon as possible. Furthermore, according to Sun Yat-sen's nation-building program, local autonomy should be based on the county as a unit. Our Chongming originally combined the inner and outer sands into one unit. Unduly dividing one unit into two has led to a sharp increase in taxes, and the people feel overwhelmed. The expansion of political expenses has hindered the progress of projects. Educational expenses are in arrears, and disturbances are frequent. Water conservancy is neglected, and droughts and floods occur frequently. Therefore, hastily dividing the area has hundreds of disadvantages and not a single advantage. We, the members of this Association, love our hometown with a patriotic heart and recognize that loving our hometown is the starting point for loving our country. We save our compatriots from fire and water, and ask the authorities for mediation. The righteousness is for the public good, and the responsibility is unavoidable. In addition to separate detailed rules, we hereby state the preface, for your common consideration.</p>
<p>Organizational Rules The organizational rules of the Chongqi Co-Governance Promotion Committee are as follows: (1) Name: The name of this association shall be the Chongqi Co-Governance Promotion Committee. (2) Purpose: The purpose of this association is to promote Chongqi co-governance and relieve the people's suffering. (3) Committee Members: In addition to the entire board of directors of the Chongming Sojourning Shanghai Students Association serving as ex officio members of this association, the association may, at its discretion, appoint one to nine representatives from fellow countrymen living abroad and local organizations to serve as members. (4) Organization: The association will have a chairman elected from among the members, and will have four sections for general affairs, publicity, planning, and communication. (5) Meetings: The association's meetings will not be held on a fixed schedule and will be convened by the chairman as needed. (6) Funding: The association's expenses will be raised by the members in various ways. (7) Address: The association's temporary address will be at the Chongming Sojourning Shanghai Students Association, No. 979 Chengdu Road, Zhabei, Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Case of Gong Shaoting Killing His Concubine Has Been Indicted</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Corpse Remains Buried in Its Original Place and Was Not Cut Into Three Sections <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Gong Falsely Accused His Concubine of Running Away After the Fact</p>
<p>Gong Shaoting, the owner of the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory located at the Gongxing Bridge South Embankment on Baoxing Road in Zhabei, conspired with his new concubine, Ms. Hou, and his son-in-law, Shen Fufu, etc., to strangle his old concubine, Xie Aiqiao (i.e., Sister Aiqiao), on the evening of the twenty-first day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. Afterward, they dismembered the corpse. Only recently did the deceased's nephew, Xie Baolin, discover the previous situation and report it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Detective Team, which arrested Gong Shaoting, Ms. Gong Hou, and the male and female accomplices who helped move the corpse, Zhou Baoquan and Li Baosheng, etc., a total of four suspects, and sent them to the local court for interrogation and detention. At the same time, they escorted the arrested suspects to unearth Sister Aiqiao's headless corpse and sent it to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for examination. However, the head is still missing. Details have been reported previously. It is now learned that after Sister Aiqiao was murdered, Gong Shaoting feared that something might go wrong, so he secretly instructed Zhou Baoquan, the worker guarding the construction site, to call the fugitive Liu Guisheng and Li Baosheng, etc., to dig up the corpse at night and transport it to another place. However, Liu Guisheng and others only put the severed head into a burlap sack and filled another burlap sack with soil, posing as Sister Aiqiao's corpse, falsely claiming that it had been cut into three sections. In reality, they only cut off the head, and the corpse remained buried in its original place. At that time, Liu Guisheng and others placed the two burlap sacks in a row basket, covered them with wooden flowers and firewood (to disguise them), carried them out with a carrying pole. According to reports, the head was buried in the Zhu Jiazhai public cemetery. However, the contents were learned by a gang of local ruffians in the area, who extorted money from them. Gong Shaoting gave Zhou Baoquan sixty yuan, instructing him to use it to pay for the corpse removal. Liu Guisheng and Li Baosheng each received twenty yuan, the ruffians took ten yuan, and the remaining ten yuan was used to buy ingot paper for burning as offerings for four yuan, and another six yuan was used to buy fish and meat at the market to feed the small laborers at the construction site, to shut their mouths. The arrangements were quite thorough. Gong Shaoting was extremely cunning and, after murdering Sister Aiqiao, even posted a notice falsely accusing Sister Aiqiao of running away, and even offered a reward, to make people believe that she had actually fled. It is now learned that the court has concluded its investigation and has filed a public indictment against Gong Shaoting, Ms. Gong Hou, and others for premeditated murder. A public trial will be held soon.</p>

<p>Permission Has Been Obtained from the State Department, Construction to Begin in April</p>
<p>Huadong News reports that the U.S. government owns a piece of land at the Bund in Shanghai. The existing buildings there are dilapidated. Currently, the consulate is located at the former location of the Creel House, where the rent costs thousands of dollars per month. The other officials are scattered in various locations. To achieve the goal of having all departments work together, they requested instructions from the State Department and raised a large amount of money to build a high-rise building to bring together the consulate, the commercial counselor's office, the finance general affairs office, and the experts stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. It is now learned that the State Department has approved the plan. The design of the new building is a 36-story high-rise, which has been approved by the State Department. Construction is expected to begin in April this year. The construction cost is estimated to be US$750,000. The Shanghai Trade Bureau has proposed issuing public bonds guaranteed by the government.</p>

<p>Origin of More Than Three Thousand Dollars' Worth of Purchased Goods Unclear</p>
<p>Husband and Wife's Telegrams Suspicious</p>
<p>The case of the British woman, the wife of Johnson, a resident of No. 361 Fahua Road, being accused of illegally manufacturing narcotics in her residence was heard again by the British Consulate Police Court on Thursday afternoon. The defendant maintained that she was unaware of the narcotics manufacturing equipment in her residence. The defendant could not explain why her and her husband's circumstances improved so dramatically after they received assistance from a charity last year, suddenly renting a large house, buying a car, and hiring many servants. The defendant admitted that since the end of December, she had paid 800 yuan as part of the car purchase price, 780 yuan for two months' rent (December and January), 250 yuan for the first installment of car fees, 300 yuan for the first installment of furniture fees, 150 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, and 79 yuan for carpet fees. When her husband left Shanghai for England on December 11, he left only 650 yuan in cash, while the defendant's expenses for purchasing goods totaled more than 3,014 yuan. Subsequently, the prosecutor presented telegrams exchanged between the defendant and her husband after the incident. In a telegram from the defendant to her husband, there was a sentence stating "The servant unauthorizedly manufactured flammable materials and caused a fire." The prosecutor argued that the defendant did not directly mention narcotics because she was trying to cover up the truth, knowing that her husband would understand that the narcotics manufacturing equipment had been discovered. In a telegram from the defendant's husband, there was "Feng gave 100 pounds," and another telegram contained "The mainland is backing you." The prosecutor said that reading these telegrams revealed subtle clues, clearly showing that the defendant knew about the narcotics manufacturing. The prosecutor questioned the defendant for a long time that day and finally asked the court to order the defendant to hand over a telegram that she claimed to have lost. The magistrate then adjourned the court and scheduled the hearing to continue on Monday.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's Xingye Trust Company's Municipal Ferry Management Office's dedicated steel double-decker floating terminal, built on the Bund at Beijing Road, was completed on the 11th of this month. Details of the design and construction of the terminal have been reported in various newspapers. It has now been learned that the internal layout of the terminal has been completed, and the company has scheduled to start using it on the 28th of this month. All of the Shanghai-Songjiang line long-distance ferries and the cross-river ferries to the Chunjiang Terminal in Pudong will berth at the new terminal from that day. It has also been learned that the company will select a date after the Lunar New Year to invite people from all walks of life to hold a formal opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Since October of last year, the woman, Ms. Cheng Xu, often purchased gold jewelry from Lao Baosheng Hengji Silver Shop at No. 65 and 67 Tonglu. Sometimes, she sold jewelry and diamond ornaments to the silver shop. Initially, only a few hundred dollars were involved, but as the two parties became more familiar with each other through transactions, the amounts gradually increased to several thousands of dollars. Ms. Xu dressed luxuriously and claimed to be related to the owner of a certain foreign department store in Ximen, implying that she was quite wealthy. Zhao Lingzeng, the Ningbo manager of Lao Baosheng Hengji Silver Shop, also trusted her deeply. When Ms. Xu's accumulated debt gradually reached 5,201 yuan and 51 cents, she had no money to pay and gave Lao Baosheng Hengji Silver Shop 29 pawn tickets for all the jewelry and diamonds she had pledged, worth a total of 10,718 yuan, as collateral. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, Ms. Cheng Xu suddenly gathered many people and went to Lao Baosheng Hengji Silver Shop, forcibly taking away all the pledge tickets she had given as collateral. At this point, Zhao Lingzeng, the manager of the silver shop, realized that Ms. Cheng Xu was a con artist, so he hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the criminal court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Ms. Cheng Xu of fraud and requesting a summons for legal punishment. After receiving the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, held a special second criminal court session presided over by Judge Wu Fanglian to issue a summons. However, the defendant, Ms. Cheng Xu, was unable to appear in court because she had committed another case of fraud involving jewelry in the Chinese area and was arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court for questioning. After the lawyer representing the plaintiff stated the case, the court scheduled the hearing for the 29th of the month, pending an investigation from the local court.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Number of Poor People at the Shanghai South Relief Center Has Increased Dramatically in Recent Days <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Totaling Two Thousand Six Hundred and Thirteen People</p>
<p>Please Help with Expenses as Much as Possible</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai South Relief Center, established for winter relief for the poor, has seen a continuous increase in the number of people it houses. A reporter from the Guomin News visited the center at 1:00 PM yesterday, and was cordially received by Director Zhang Zixin, who led the reporter inside to inspect the poor. Although these people are homeless and destitute civilians, the order is very calm. Director Zhang also provided a detailed account of the center's overall situation, stating that the relief center is established every winter. The preparations began with a meeting of various charities convened by the Shanghai Charity Federation, following a letter from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and under the supervision of benefactors such as Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi of the Federation. In accordance with established practice, the relief center was established in the South Shanghai area to house poor people without clothing or food. This year, the center was opened early at the Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station, and a second center was established at the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road. At the beginning of the preparations, local gentry and merchants, such as Zhang Xiaoliang, were consulted to solicit large batches of planks from major lumber merchants and hire craftsmen to build sheds and other complete renovations. The internal organization is divided into management, accounting, general affairs, storage, supply, accommodation, registration, inspection, sanitation, and security. The staff members are selected and appointed by the chairman of the committee. Since the reception began on December 1st of last year, the number of poor people housed has reached 2,613 in both locations. The weather is suddenly cold, and more people are crowding in. When registering poor people, they are first questioned in detail, and their age, origin, occupation, and address (if any) are carefully investigated and filled in on the registration form. Then, a symbol is issued, their hair is shaved, they are bathed, and they are given accommodation and supplies. A set of winter clothes is issued, and their bodies are examined. If they are found to be addicted to opium or other diseases, they are sent to the city's drug rehabilitation center or given opium leaves daily to help them quit, or they are sent to various charity clinics for treatment. The poor are given three meals a day, two porridge and one rice, and vegetarian dishes. Currently, about 20 shi of rice are needed for daily meals. The poor are managed in groups of twelve, with one person with some knowledge selected as the group leader. Two people share one bed in the dormitory, and quilts are provided completely. During meals and lodging, they must obey the command of the group leader and be managed by the administrators in rotation. The emphasis is on supervision and guidance. Police officers are sent by the Public Security Bureau to maintain order among the poor. Once the weather warms up in the spring, they will be sent away in batches, either with money or with train and ship tickets to return to their hometowns, or sent to relevant charitable organizations for education, care, and relief. However, due to various difficulties in managing, supplying, and funding, the center has not been able to establish a separate female center to house and relieve women and children in poverty, and feels that this is a regrettable shortcoming. The center has no dedicated funds and relies entirely on fundraising to support itself. Currently, in addition to the subsidies allocated by the city government, benefactors and charities have donated more than 16,000 yuan. All income and expenditure are carefully managed, and reports are prepared and submitted to the chairman of the committee for review every ten days, and funds are withdrawn from the Federation in installments for actual expenditure and verification. A report will be compiled and printed for distribution to various sectors of society for creditworthiness. The center strives for openness and hopes that all sectors will provide more guidance.</p>

<p>Unrequited Love Despite the Woman's Cold Shoulder</p>
<p>Beaten and Injured, Case Opens Today</p>
<p>Li Zhenfu from Guangdong, unmarried, previously worked at the Shanghai Bank in this city as a branch manager, and is now the deputy manager of a certain steel company. Two years ago, he fell in love with Huang Peixian, the sister of the famous Shanghai courtesan, Yue-woman Huang Peizhen (also known as Bibi Wang). They were engaged, but an incident occurred midway, and Li's nerves were stimulated, and he attempted suicide several times. The Huang sisters also accused Li of intimidation, and the details were reported in the newspapers. On the night of December 8 last year, Li met Huang Peixian at the Grand Cathay Theatre. Huang was with other boyfriends, which caused Li to attempt suicide again. He was discovered by the resident doctor and sent to Shilong Hospital for treatment, and survived. After recovering from his illness, Li still tried to reconcile with his old lover. Because Huang is a Christian, he prepared gifts such as candies and flower baskets on December 25 of last year (i.e., Christmas) and went to Huang's residence at No. 5, 4th floor, No. 3 Miaonong, Jing'an Temple Road, to give them. Li's intentions were sincere, but Huang Peixian, although a woman, is very physically fit and strong. She did not appreciate Li's actions and, due to a conflict, physically attacked Li with her fists and feet. Li, weakened by his recent illness, was beaten and injured. The police were notified at the time. Chinese and Western police officers arrived at the scene and stopped the fight, rescuing Li. Li then went to seek medical treatment himself. It is now learned that Li has hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to sue Huang Peixian for malicious injury. The lawsuit states that "Although Huang is a woman, she is good at swimming and sports, weighs one hundred and twenty or thirty pounds, is strong and powerful, and is no different from a brave man." It is quite amusing. After the court approved the petition, the hearing was scheduled for 2:30 PM today in the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special First Court.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to Municipal Government Again <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Reduction in Medicine and Liquor License Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the municipal government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the continuation of the submission based on the facts: It has been found that the Shanghai National Medicine Trade Association requested a reduction or exemption of the medicine and liquor license tax and the return of the fine from Lao Lai Yi. This matter was forwarded by your subordinate association to your office, document number 2471, which disapproved the request. After the record of the disapproval was circulated and made known, the National Medicine Trade Association submitted a letter to this association, stating roughly that complete exemption of the medicine and liquor license tax is difficult to obtain. However, it has been found that the medicine and liquor tax has been divided into two types, four yuan and two yuan. The municipal government has approved that the over-collection of eight yuan for those who originally paid four yuan be corrected according to the regulations. There will be no further conflicts. However, those who originally paid two yuan are all small-scale, with few customers, struggling to avoid hunger and cold, barely maintaining operations, like walking on thin ice. Recently, they have been even more affected by the economic downturn. Moreover, their numbers are limited. The increase of two yuan by the municipal government is not much, but for these businesses, these two yuan are more than tens of millions for the wealthy. Their economic capacity is very fragile. In addition to forwarding the municipal government's instructions to all Chinese members for compliance, a special document has been prepared to request the municipal government to show compassion for the difficulties of businesses and show mercy beyond the law. All Chinese medicine and liquor license taxes should maintain the original status and continue to be collected in two types, four yuan and two yuan, to show consideration and facilitate survival, etc. According to this, it has been found that Chinese medicine stores also sell medicine and liquor for treatment, which is different from those who specialize in selling alcohol for consumption. This has been described in detail in previous submissions from your subordinate association. It is now said that the Chinese medicine stores in the Chinese area that hold two-yuan licenses are all small-scale businesses. If the tax is doubled, it will be difficult to support, which is true. The request to keep the Chinese medicine and liquor license tax at the original status, divided into two levels of four yuan and two yuan, is indeed for the sake of the majority of small-scale businesses. It is reasonable to continue to submit this matter based on the facts. We hope that your office will review and approve this matter and order the Finance Bureau to approve the request for the sake of public convenience. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Gradual Improvement in Domestic Cement <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Strong Sales and Rising Prices</p>
<p>Guangdong's Implementation of Control Affects Trade</p>
<p>China's cement industry was severely declining due to the dumping of cement by Japan and Russia. Since the government increased import tariffs, foreign loans have become more expensive and imports have decreased. The business has gradually improved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sales Have Improved According to people in the cement industry yesterday, China's cement industry has long been manipulated by Japan and Russia, resulting in a sharp drop in market prices and sluggish sales. Since the government increased cement import tariffs last year, foreign loans have become more expensive and imports have decreased sharply. Domestic cement has gradually improved. Since the beginning of winter, sales have been particularly strong. The daily sales volume is generally more than 1,500 barrels. The monthly output of cement companies such as Qixing in North China, Longtan in Jiangsu Province, and China Merchants is often insufficient to supply demand. The current selling price per barrel is six yuan, an increase of 20-30% compared to the past. There is a possibility of further price increases in the future.</p>
<p>Guangdong Implements Control Recently, in order to develop the industry in the province, Guangdong Province has implemented control over the cement trade, stipulating that buildings worth more than 10,000 yuan must purchase the province's Five Rams brand cement. As a result, cement produced in other provinces has no possibility of being sold. This province is a cement-producing area, and its foreign trade has been severely affected. Since the second half of last year, no cement has been transported from this city to Guangdong for sale.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association holds a charity fair every year in February. All ticket revenue is used for the annual expenses of the voluntary schools and other charitable activities run by the association. It is reported that the date of this year's meeting has been set for the evening of the 11th of next month at the Paramount Ballroom of Jing'an Temple. In addition to exquisite entertainment programs, there will also be a lottery to increase the interest of the guests. More than a thousand tickets have been sold, and it is expected to be an unprecedented event. It is also reported that various prizes are donated by major companies, stores, and factories, including high-quality radios, electric stoves, electric fans, picture frames, cosmetics, and other valuable items. If there are still those who have not donated and are willing to help, please send your products or sales items directly to Bomei Company at 390 Jing'an Temple Road for collection, so as to jointly support the charity and promote your business. It is indeed a win-win situation.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after Wang Bin resigned as the magistrate of Chongming County, the provincial government appointed Chen Yingkun to succeed him. Chen did not take office for some reason and Deng Bixing was appointed instead. Deng is from Nanchang and has served as the section chief of the Hubei Department of Education and the section chief of the Jiujiang Municipal Committee. He is very knowledgeable and experienced. After Deng was appointed, he came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Wang Qingmu, a fellow villager from Chongming who lives in Shanghai, hosted a banquet for him at Yizhi Xiang Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road. More than a dozen people attended, including Lu Caifu, Tong Xingbai, Cao Binglin, Shi Chongpeng, Chen Dongbai, Xu Peihang, Song An, and Zhu Yakui. During the banquet, Wang delivered a speech to welcome Deng and reported on the situation of the Chongqi joint administration movement. Deng then delivered a speech on his views on governing Chongming and expressed his sympathy for the joint administration movement. Magistrate Deng left Shanghai by boat yesterday to take office.</p>
<h3 id="e112">County Government Returns Public Security Loans <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Security expenses for October of the 18th year of the Republic of China were difficult to raise because the municipal funds were suspended. During the tenure of the former county magistrate Lu, the district offices were ordered to raise loans on behalf of the public security bureau, which issued stamped receipts. Later, because the funds of the branch bureaus were insufficient, the districts were again ordered to guarantee and borrow firewood and rice from the stores. Except for the store accounts and temporary advances, which have been repaid in installments from the remaining public security funds by the county government, the remaining loan portion has not yet been repaid. The district chiefs have previously submitted a report requesting repayment. Now, the Finance Department has ordered that the repayment be made from the remaining county tax funds for the 22nd year of the Republic of China. As this fundraising is mostly collected in small amounts, formal receipts are required before payment can be made. Therefore, the county government yesterday instructed the district offices to collect all the original receipts from the creditors and send them to the county as proof for the district to forward the payment.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Engineer Gao Gongmao of Shunchang Stone Powder Factory Was Kidnapped and Escaped <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The person himself sent a telegram from Ningbo saying that he had escaped and was returning to his hometown</p>
<p>The family members were half-convinced and went to inquire</p>
<p>Gao Gongmao, an engineer at the Shunchang Stone Powder Factory and Iron Factory in Zhoujiadu, was kidnapped on the morning of the 19th of this month. At 10:00 a.m., he and the factory owner Ma Xiongguan were traveling in their own car to the issuing office. When they were passing in front of the St. Mary's Girls' School on Bailinan Road, they were suddenly ambushed by four bandits. The bandits threw a bicycle in front of the car to block the way. Then they jumped into the car and showed their pistols. Since the factory owner Ma Xiongguan was wearing worker's clothing, he was driven down. Instead, the engineer Gao Gongmao was kidnapped. After driving for about a mile, the bandits also drove the driver down and drove away themselves. The next day, the car was found at the intersection of Xiai Xians Road and Ladu Road in the French Concession. After the incident, the factory owner and Gao's family reported the case to the Public Security Bureau and the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, requesting a thorough investigation. The details have been reported previously. After the case occurred, the authorities in the Chinese and French Concessions attached great importance to it. Although they tried their best to investigate, they could not find any clues. To this day, Gao's whereabouts are unknown, and there has been no letter from the bandits, making the investigation even more difficult. Unexpectedly, Gao's wife, Shi Lanxuan, (who works as a clerk in the Toyota Yarn Factory in Fanhuangdu) suddenly received a telegram from Gao Gongmao from her hometown in Qianpai Xuan, Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, the day before yesterday (the 24th), stating: "Shanghai Fanhuangdu Toyota Yarn Factory Shi Lanxuan, I passed Ningbo yesterday and arrived safely in Xin, tell Shunchang, Gongmao." After receiving the telegram, Shi was surprised and delighted, but also half-convinced. In addition to reporting to the Shunchang Iron Factory, she also sent the telegram to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau for instructions. After detailed study, they believed that the telegram needed to be verified. Therefore, at noon the day before yesterday, Shi sent a telegram to Xinchang to inquire about the truth from her father-in-law Gao Yunjie. At about 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, she received another telegram from Gao Gongmao in Xinchang, stating: "Shanghai Fanhuangdu Toyota Yarn Factory Shi Lanxuan, I arrived home safely this afternoon, Mao." Therefore, Shi also sent this telegram to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau for reporting. After reviewing the telegram, Director Wang Dasui of the bureau ordered Geng Shoubao, the leader of the detective squad stationed in the bureau, to appoint detectives Zhong Xuehuai and Zhu Bengui to take their passports and official documents and rush to Xinchang on the Ning Shao Company's commercial ship last night to meet Gao and investigate the truth of Gao's escape for reporting purposes. Gao's wife, Shi Lanxuan, also went with them. It is expected that the truth will be revealed soon.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Xinzha Police Station Uncovers Two Heroin Manufacturing Sites <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Profit-seeking People Fear No Law</p>
<p>One Falls, Another Rises, Impossible to Catch Them All</p>
<p>The public security authorities of the Public Concession have recently been cracking down on drugs, and large-scale operations involving red pills and morphine are frequently uncovered. Smaller-scale operations are uncovered almost daily. However, those who profit from this are fearless of the law. They rise one after another. There is no end to catching them. The day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Mao Yiwen and Western Detective Bao Taibo of the Xinzha Police Station uncovered two large heroin manufacturing sites in the Chinese and French Concessions. The details of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Debao from Zhejiang, also known as Zhao Jinsun, has been making a lot of money from operating drugs. He lives at No. 4 Juxian Village, Lane 116, Kangnuo Road (Chinese Area). He usually lives a luxurious life, employs many servants, and buys his own car for transportation. The concession number is 13162. Han has recently realized that manufacturing drugs can make a lot of money, and it is more profitable than other industries. Therefore, he rented a semi-Western-style house at No. 11 1/2 Huangjiasha Garden, Block B, Xinzha, from the China Business Company on Sichuan Road, for a monthly rent of about 80 taels of silver. He set up machines, hired male and female workers, and worked day and night to manufacture the most poisonous heroin for private sale. This was discovered by Chinese Detective Mao Yiwen of the Xinzha Police Station. He reported the matter to the First Special Court and obtained a search warrant. At about 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, he, together with Chinese Detective Yang Peizhang, Ruan Yao, and Western Detective Bao Tai, secretly went to No. 11 1/2 Huangjiasha Garden and arrested nine male and female workers, including (1) Wang Gengsheng from Jiangbei, (2) Cai Qiugen from Pudong, (3) Zhou Jinqiu from Shaoxing, (4) Wo Gengsheng from Ningbo, (5) Wang Agen from Jiangbei, (6) Tian Xilin from Shaoxing, (7) Madam Zhou Zhao, (8) He Jumei, (9) Du Qiao'e, all from Shaoxing. They seized six large packages of opium, totaling 53 pounds, 84 taels of heroin powder, five account books, two seals, and contracts. Later, the arrested criminals confessed that the boss of this case was Han Debao and led the Chinese and Western detectives and detectives from the Sixth District Public Security Bureau to No. 4 Juxian Village, Kangnuo Road, where Han was arrested. Forty-seven taels of morphine were seized, along with his wife Han Wu, Wang Xiangjin, Wang Wu, Wang Xiankang, and five others, as well as a car. They were all taken to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau for temporary detention, pending transfer. Yesterday morning, the police station first sent the nine male and female criminals, including Wang Gengsheng, who were arrested in the concession, to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court for prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, rose to state the circumstances of the case, saying that the police station arrested the nine defendants in No. 11 1/2 Huangjiasha Garden. When the investigators arrived, one or two defendants jumped out of the window and climbed onto the roof. The first defendant, Wang Gengsheng, fell into a lower roof due to panic and was captured. The second defendant, Cai Qiugen, was arrested by the investigators on the roof. According to the confessions of the one or two defendants, this operation was controlled by Han Debao, who lives at No. 4 Kangnuo Road. Han came to this operation once a day to guide the dispensing and manufacturing methods. After the heroin was made, he took it away. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and fourth defendants were workers, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth, three female defendants were maids. After seizing the above-mentioned items, they went to No. 4 Juxian Village, Kangnuo Road, together with the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. When they arrived, the double doors were tightly closed. After the investigators knocked on the door for a long time, the tenth defendant, Han Debao, also escaped to the roof of No. 1 next door. After being captured, the twelfth defendant, Wang Xiangjin, opened the door, and a total of five people were arrested. Forty-seven taels of morphine and a car were seized. They are now all in the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. They requested the court to prepare a document so that they could be transferred. The police station requested permission to reschedule the case and asked the court to go to the scene for inspection to clarify the truth. The seized opium and heroin were presented to the court. The remaining machines and other items were not brought because they were inconvenient to carry. When questioned, all the defendants confessed that they were hired by Han Debao. Judge Liu Yugui ordered that the case be rescheduled for next Wednesday. The four defendants, six, seven, eight, and nine, who had minor offenses, were allowed to be released on bail of 20 yuan each, while the others were detained. It was decided to go to No. 11 1/2 Huangjiasha Garden for inspection at 3:00 p.m. today.</p>

<p>Six shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Hankou line in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as the state-run China Merchants Bureau, the private Sanbei, Ningshao, British Taikoo, Yihai, and Japanese Nisshin, had signed an agreement to form an alliance and cooperate to implement shared water transport prices before the Shanghai War. After the dissolution, the companies competed fiercely, resulting in a drastic drop in water transport prices. Now, the companies have realized this deeply and are planning to resume the alliance and cooperation. They are currently negotiating separately, and it is expected that a formal meeting will be held after the end of the accounting period to make a decision.</p>

<p>Please Contact the Industry Association and the China Merchants Bureau for Negotiations</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the state-run China Merchants Bureau implemented water and land cargo intermodal transport with the Longhai Railway, the cargo along the line was transferred from the Lao Yao Wharf, and the cargo at the Dapu Wharf decreased sharply. The Dazhen Shipping Company, which operates between Shanghai and Dapu, has leased all its ships, Yongji (1,847 tons), Yongping (1,421 tons), and Yongan (1,421 tons), to the China Merchants Bureau for a period of eight months. Now that the term has expired, Dazhen Company has decided to take them back. The Yongping has been returned a few days ago and entered the dock for annual major repairs. The Yongji is scheduled to be returned at the end of the month, and the Yongan is scheduled to be returned on the 15th of next month. The company has decided to operate the Shanghai-Lianyungang line, because it has been approved by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to participate in the Shanghai-Hai line intermodal transport. The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association is currently negotiating with the China Merchants Bureau. If the issue of Yongping participating in intermodal transport after repairs has not been resolved, it is decided to temporarily operate the Shanghai-Fuzhou line.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Advocates the Use of Han Regular Script Movable Type Edition <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Han Regular Script Movable Type Edition was created by the Han Regular Script Printing Bureau on Shandong Road in this city. The font is neat and the strokes are beautiful. It is a new era in Chinese printing tools. Therefore, the popularity of regular script printing has been widespread in recent years. The documents directly printed by the bureau are no less than 40,000 to 50,000 types, such as the Railway Yearbook, the National Bank Yearbook, and the National Salt Administration Records. All the macro-volumes are printed with this movable type. More than 360 printing houses in China have changed to or also print the Han Regular Script Movable Type Edition due to social demand. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek considered this Han Regular Script Movable Type Edition to be popular and beautiful, and the regular script has an extremely important position in Chinese cultural history and has been the script used by the nation for thousands of years. Promoting the inherent culture and popularizing mass education require the promotion of regular script printing. Therefore, he ordered the subordinate agencies to adopt it uniformly to promote and spread it widely.</p>

<p>The Suzhou River has been reported in the newspapers recently due to the shallow water in the river and the excessive number of ships passing through, resulting in the interruption of navigation. It is now known that since Xu Zunian, the patrol officer of the Second Water Patrol Division of the Public Security Bureau, led the police to find ways to dredge the river for several days, as of yesterday afternoon, although there has been navigation for two days and nights, it is still temporarily opened and closed due to the excessive number of ships. Officer Xu believed that this would not be a proper solution, so at about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, he called the headquarters and asked the First Division to order the ships to be blocked from entering the river with ropes at the Waibaidu Bridge, because it was high tide at that time, and the original ships in the river were allowed to sail westward with the tide, so the navigation was completely opened at about 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Li Meiying Sues for Mediation and Divorce from Wei Yifei</p>
<p>Detailed Account of Wei's Absurd Behavior</p>
<p>The Mother-in-Law Has Three Nicknames</p>
<p>The woman Li Meiying, also known as Wei Li, is twenty-four years old, from Ningbo, and currently resides at No. 36 Jiugeng Lane, Miller Road, Hongkou. She was previously married to Wei Yifei (twenty-eight years old, from Shaoxing, owner of Shiyi Bakery and part-time actor in film companies), currently residing at No. 160 at the intersection of Beile Road and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Recently, due to a breakdown in the marital relationship, Li hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court, accusing her husband of abuse and abandonment, requesting mediation for divorce, and seeking alimony, etc. Upon receiving the petition, the court, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, convened both parties to the Seventh Tribunal for mediation, presided over by Judge Li Liang. The petitioner, Li Meiying, stated that she was married to the respondent through a matchmaker on the second day of the ninth lunar month in the eighteenth year of the Republic. Only after the marriage did she discover that he</p>
<p>indulges in gambling and prostitution, does not engage in proper work, and only makes a living by acting in movies. When she advised him, not only did he not change, but he harbored resentment and frequently subjected her to beatings and insults over the years. Moreover, her mother-in-law aided and abetted his wrongdoing, and resented her for having too few dowry gifts, often saying she wanted her son to remarry. During the January 28th Incident, the respondent's business flourished, and he purchased a car, becoming even more absurd. He secretly rented a house with the prostitute Shi Fanglaoqi, and contracted syphilis, which he transmitted to her, causing her third child to be born with sores all over the body and die after a little over ten days. After breaking up with Shi Fanglaoqi, he took in Chunqiulaoqi as a singer, renting a house for her at No. 40 Xixiang Lane, Sichuan Road, spending four or five thousand gold coins. Later, he had an affair with the prostitute Tao Yahong Ajiu, spending tens of thousands of gold. As a result, Chunqiulaoqi resented his</p>
<p>infidelity and filed a lawsuit in court, costing several thousand more gold coins. The petitioner, concerned about his extravagant spending and the risk of contracting syphilis, repeatedly cried and pleaded with him, but to no avail. In the winter of the twenty-second year, the respondent, taking advantage of her returning home to visit her mother, moved away all the rosewood furniture from the house. Knowing his ill intentions, the woman sternly questioned him, but he saw her as a thorn in his side. On May 2nd of this year, the respondent tried to move her clothes trunk unsuccessfully and even stabbed her with a knife. She then reported to the police station, and he left and never returned. A few weeks later, she encountered him on the street and questioned him, only to be beaten again. She reported the abuse to the police three times. The respondent, through his mother and brother-in-law Chen Kaihua, etc.,</p>
<p>lured her into divorce, offering to pay her silver dollars four thousand five hundred. The woman couldn't bear it and hoped that the respondent would repent and change his ways, so she listened to their advice and let it go. However, since then, he only occasionally came home during the day and never stayed overnight. The woman's tolerance was based on the importance she placed on the marital bond. In mid-December of last year, the respondent decided to reduce her monthly allowance from fifty yuan to thirty yuan. When she refused, he started creating trouble every day. On December 30th, the woman returned home to visit her mother and then went to the theater with her older sister to relieve her depression. Upon returning home from the theater at night, the respondent, believing he had an opportunity, falsely accused the petitioner of misconduct outside the home, locked the door, and refused to let her in. The petitioner had no choice but to return to her mother's home and cry. Later, despite repeated persuasion from relatives, the respondent insisted on forcing a divorce and neglected his two young children. Under such circumstances, he showed</p>
<p>no kindness and intended to abandon her, so she requested alimony of fifteen thousand yuan, and the return of clothes, jewelry, and the educational expenses for the two children, etc. The respondent Wei Yifei did not appear in court. His lawyer stated that the petitioner had been exceptionally shrewish since marrying the respondent, and even the mother-in-law and sisters-in-law were afraid of her. The neighbors all knew this, and her associates were all unemployed hooligans, so the respondent dared not appear in court today. Last month, the petitioner claimed to return to Ningbo and went to a</p>
<p>dance hall with an unknown young man. After dancing, they went to a hotel in Hongkou. The next day, she returned home, and the respondent had collected evidence and was about to file a lawsuit. Instead, the petitioner preemptively framed him. All her claims are completely false, etc. Li Meiying also said that her mother-in-law was a notorious female tiger. After the woman married into the family, she slept in the woman's room every night. She took a bath every day in the summer, and every time she bathed, she made the woman scrub her back. After bathing, she sat on a stool to cool off, completely naked. When the woman told her to put on her pants, not only did she not listen, but she was scolded. The mother-in-law had three nicknames: Female Tiger, Twelve O'Clock, and Crazy. At this point, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful and ordered the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit, then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>The "Southeast Scenic Tour" book compiled by the Southeast Five Provinces Transportation Tour Association has rich content and many three-color and copperplate photographs. The preparations have cost tens of thousands of dollars and taken more than half a year. Having this book is better than touring famous mountains and rivers, and those who aspire to travel can use it as a guidebook. The listed price is eight yuan per book. To promote travel and facilitate transportation, pre-orders are only four yuan. In recent days, pre-orders have been extremely enthusiastic, and the pre-ordered number is about to be exhausted. It is said that due to the high printing cost, there are no plans to reprint after it is sold out. The pre-order period ends at the end of this month, and it will be published on February 15th. Therefore, those who wish to pre-order, please go to the United Advertising Company at No. 255 Shandong Road, Shanghai, the headquarters of China Travel Service on Sichuan Road, the Life Bookstore at No. 384 Fuzhou Road, the Sixth Section of the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou, and the branches of China Travel Service in Guangzhou, Nanjing, and other places to pre-order.</p>

<p>Recently, Western newspapers have repeatedly reported news about the Ministry of Finance regarding sulfuric acid and nitric acid. According to Xie Xiaochu, a member of the City Chamber of Commerce, the monopoly of sulfuric acid and nitric acid in Jiangsu Province began in April of the twenty-first year and was handled by the Tongxing Company under the commission of the Jiangsu Provincial General Office for Nitric and Sulfuric Acid Transportation and Sales. A surplus profit of one dollar per box was collected. Now, the contract between the Jiangsu Provincial General Office for Nitric and Sulfuric Acid Transportation and Sales and the Jiangsu Provincial General Bureau of Nitric and Sulfuric Acid is expiring at the end of this month. The Jiangsu Provincial General Bureau of Nitric and Sulfuric Acid, in view of the importance of sulfuric and nitric acid to industry, and for the convenience of management, has taken it back and presented it to the Ministry of Finance for direct invitation of merchants to contract. Currently, there are rumors from various sectors that I am contracted to handle it, which is a misunderstanding. Although I am engaged in the chemical raw materials business, I am very busy with many affairs, and my time and energy are difficult to spare. Yesterday, I met with Huang Chundao, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial General Bureau of Nitric and Sulfuric Acid, who said that Lei Runqin, the founder of Huaan Chemical Factory, has been commissioned to take over the handling, and will take office on February 1st. The surplus profit will remain the same, with one dollar per box collected.</p>

<p>Social Bureau Rejects Request</p>
<p>In this city's fresh pork butchering industry, when pigs are collected from the pigpens, a slaughtering fee must be paid. Last December, the pig butchering industry suddenly raised objections, petitioning party and government agencies to request its abolition, and requesting the assistance of the City Chamber of Commerce, which led to opposition from the pigpens and caused disputes. The city party headquarters summoned them for mediation. Now, the case has been reviewed by the Social Bureau based on the facts, and the pig butcher's request to abolish the slaughtering fee has been rejected.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Smuggled Opium Discovered on Changxing Wheel <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>One Captain Arrested for Investigation</p>
<p>The Changxing Wheel of the Sanbei Company discovered smuggled opium on board on its return to Shanghai from Hankou. The person carrying it was arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Searched: The Hankou authorities are very strict in searching for smuggling when ships leave. Since the ban on opium, the prevention of opium smuggling has been even stricter. A special opium suppression inspectorate has been formed to be in charge of searching. When the Jianglun ships of each company are launched, they must be searched, regardless of the coal ship or the fire cabin. When the Changxing Wheel of the Sanbei Company left Hankou, it was on Tuesday. As the ship was sailing, a team of opium suppression inspectors boarded the ship to search. It seemed that they had received a tip-off, so they searched every place.</p>
<p>Opium Seized: The staff of the Opium Suppression Inspectorate first searched the cabins but found nothing. Later, they searched the fire cabin but found nothing. Finally, they searched the coal cabin near the machine and seized a bag of smuggled opium. It was said to contain five or six hundred taels. After the inspection team seized the opium, they searched again, because they received a tip that there was more than one bag of smuggled opium. But after a thorough search, no second batch was found. They took the seized opium and began investigating the person carrying it.</p>
<p>Captain Arrested: After the opium was discovered, the person responsible for smuggling the opium was investigated. All the crew members and porters said they did not know anything. Finally, after questioning by the inspectors, it was discovered that a cook in the small galley of the ship was suspected of smuggling. The cook was arrested on the spot and taken ashore to the inspectorate for interrogation. The Changxing Wheel was then allowed to sail to Shanghai. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the captain, Jiao Dingxi, went to the bureau yesterday to report to the director the situation of the opium seizure and the arrest of the cook.</p>

<p>Xu Yin, a woman from Liyang, due to the famine there last September, brought her daughters Jin Di, twelve years old, and Yi Di, eight years old, to Shanghai to sell to Che Guo, a woman from Taizhou, No. 45 Tongchang Lane, Haining Road, for 125 yuan, to Wu Zhang, No. 373 Tongchang Lane, and Ji Jinhai, No. 365 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, as daughters-in-law. There was a contract. Recently, a fellow villager, Ruan Mugen, learned of this way to make a living and also brought his six-year-old younger sister, Tong Di, and his six-year-old niece, Zhang Su Di, to Shanghai to be sold by Che Guo. Zhang Su Di was taken out by a fellow villager named Xiao Jinzi, and could not be found. Ruan Tong Di was told by Che Guo and her cohabiting Cantonese woman Chen A Gu to Qi Gu, a Cantonese woman in nearby Dexing Lane, that the price was 62 yuan to be an adopted daughter, and a deposit of 2 yuan was paid first. While this was in progress, Xu Yongyuan, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives Zhang Yunsheng and Chen Dabao, learned of the situation and, in coordination with Western detectives, went to Tongchang Lane at 2:30 PM on the 13th of this month and arrested Xu Yin, Ruan Mugen, Che Guo, the main offender, Che Yongkang, her lover, the Cantonese woman Chen A Gu, and others. They also rescued the Liyang girls Yin Xiao Litou, twelve years old (who was brought from her hometown by Xu Yin to stay with her), Ruan Tong Di, Xu Jin Di, and Yi Di, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. Yin Xiao Litou and the other four girls were sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen visited the Third Criminal Court and thoroughly investigated the defendants, sentencing Che Guo to two years and four months in prison, Ruan Mugen to seven months in prison, and Chen A Gu to six months in prison, with a three-year suspended sentence. Che Yongkang and Xu Yin were acquitted and released.</p>

<p>The Xinhe Electroplating Machinery Factory at No. 40, Lvsheng Lane, Dongyouheng Road, is owned by Chen Ruisheng, a native of Ningbo. On the afternoon of the previous day, around 6:00 PM, an apprentice named Sun Zhaofa, fifteen years old, also a native of Ningbo, felt dissatisfied with his work and, in a fit of resentment, took his own life by secretly drinking potassium cyanide solution used for electroplating. He was found by his companion Shi Daihe, who saw him moaning on the ground and immediately informed the shop owner. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detective Ji Peijin to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with medical examiner Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to go to the mortuary to examine the body. According to Hua Butou Shen Baoshan, Sun Zhaofa had said he had been treated unfairly. Shi Daihe testified that he was from Shaoxing, twelve years old, and also an apprentice in the factory. The deceased had told him that he was very dissatisfied with his work and was afraid that his father would blame him when he returned home. Last night, he saw him fall to the ground. The boss had not beaten him. Sun Yongzheng, the father of the deceased, also submitted a statement. Guo Jun ordered the examination to confirm that Sun Zhaofa, male, died from drinking potassium cyanide poison. The body was handed over to his father, Sun Yongzheng, who signed a receipt and took it back for burial.</p>

They were ordered to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.

The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be two days equal to one day of imprisonment. The pistol and magazine were confiscated.</p>

<p>Frozen Beggar: Around 6:00 PM on the previous day, a man, approximately thirty years old, with torn clothes and appearing to be a beggar, was found lying frozen to death near the entrance of Cunshan Lane, Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, Western Shanghai. Zhu Fangxuan, the patrolling police chief of the Caojiadu Public Security Branch, investigated and confirmed that he had frozen to death and had already died. He immediately reported to Director Wang, who ordered the local Baotou to report to the local court for an inquest. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Xie was commissioned by the court to visit the scene and confirm that he had frozen to death and ordered the hall to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Passenger Dies: At the Datong Wharf on the 16th Pu in the South City, the Hongda Yangtze River ship arrived and docked yesterday morning. A passenger, Mr. Jia, fell ill on the way. When he landed, he was too ill to stand up, and he sat on the ground and died shortly after. The local branch ordered the local head Lu Yongde to report to the local court for an inquest. Xiao Jin-ying, a prosecutor commissioned by Li, led examiners to the scene and found that the deceased was approximately forty years old, wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers, and had died of illness. It was ordered that the hall provide a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Jia Jingcai's Baby Dies Tragically</p>
<p>At around 8:10 AM yesterday, a thatch shed with no address in the lime kiln of Xiaoshadu, Western Shanghai, the home of Jia Jingcai from Danyang, carelessly started a fire while cooking, and the accumulated firewood suddenly caused a thick smoke to spread and penetrate the roof. In an instant, it spread to the neighbors on the left and right. The fire brigade quickly drove to the scene and extinguished the fire. A total of three thatched sheds were burned down. When the fire was raging, Jia Jingcai and his wife, Ms. Du, were eager to escape and forgot to take out their newborn baby, who had not yet reached one month old, resulting in her being buried and burned to death in the fire. Officer Gu of the Roberts Road Police Substation sent police officers to investigate and arrested and sent Jia Jingcai and his wife to the Caojiadu Substation for questioning.</p>

<p>▲ Monkey King Brand Standard Flashlight Sells Well Mou Zikuan, the manager of Zhenfeng Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory, in view of the increasing use of flashlights and the fact that most of the flashlights sold on the market are imported, established a factory on Datong Road in Zhabei to produce two types of flashlights, Monkey King brand and Standard brand. Since their launch, they have been popular due to their low price, strong light, and the fact that they are entirely domestic products. In less than a year, they have almost taken the place of certain other brand flashlights. Manager Mou has recently established distribution offices in Jixiang Street in the French Concession, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. Local merchants have already come to Shanghai to negotiate exclusive sales rights. The business has a promising upward trend, opening up a good prospect for domestic products.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: A Remote and Simple Official Quickly Issues a Strong Decree; Outside the Magnificent Hall, There Are Pitiful Creatures</p>
<p>This is truly a malpractice. I heard that my predecessor used twenty-four debt collectors. Cheng Zhiqian couldn't help but laugh when he heard this. Zhou Yourong said, "Brother Zhiqian, do you think I'm lying?" Zhiqian laughed, "I'm not laughing at you for lying, I'm laughing at your limited view. There's a county in Gansu where there are one hundred and twenty-eight debt collectors. This number isn't just a rumor, it's an unofficial announcement. So, what's the big deal about twenty or thirty debt collectors?" Zhou Yourong said to Jiefu, "Listen to what kind of government this is? As a magistrate, you have no other task than to scrape money from the people. If they don't have money, you force them to their death. If they squeeze out money, you hand it over to the local garrison with both hands. Education, justice, construction, nothing can be discussed." Jiefu said, "How can justice not be discussed? Are the people so poor that they can't even afford lawsuits?" Zhou Yourong said, "Of course they are. They have problems even getting food. What lawsuits can they file? Even if there are lawsuits, and you decide on a crime, the commander can send a groom to take the person away. You've wasted your effort. Conversely, if the people offend the commander, and he doesn't want to hand them over to the military court, they send them to the county. The magistrate has to follow orders with the utmost care. If you don't, the groom will slap the county magistrate in the face. The emperor is far away, where can you go to complain about injustice? But I'm different. I came here with the orders of the provincial government. I won't let them interfere with matters within my yamen. There have been several conflicts, but they didn't dare to openly kill me, so they had to back down." Jiefu said, "Since the local commander backed down, why did Magistrate Zhou quit?" Zhou Yourong stomped his feet and jumped up, saying, "It's unbearable! Two recent incidents made it impossible for me to continue. Once, a merchant came from another county, probably very rich. He was arrested by the Eighth Master and taken to the city wall. They hung him up and beat him to force him to give money. They never got the money and strangled him to death, throwing him off the city wall. Of course, the county magistrate is responsible for an unidentified corpse on the ground." (122)</p>
<h3 id="e144">Talking About Deer <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Mengjiao</p>
<p>Deer are produced in the mountains and forests, and they are extremely docile. People in the past mostly used them as embellishments for gardens. Male deer have antlers, shaped like tree branches, which are quite beautiful. Females do not have antlers. Their fur is reddish-brown with white star-shaped spots, resembling plum blossoms, hence the common name "sika deer." There are many different kinds.</p>
<p>The antlers of male deer are like sprouts when they first grow, covered with skin. The swollen part of the skin is shaped like a mushroom, called deer velvet, which is a precious ingredient in medicine. The ones produced in the three eastern provinces are especially good, called "Northeast deer velvet." After the antlers grow, they branch out. They are shed and replaced every year, adding one branch each year, until they stop when they are old.</p>
<p>The Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy in Hangzhou was established very early and has a large scale. It raises dozens of deer inside, enclosed by iron fences, for people to browse. This is because they store medicinal materials. When I was young, I often went to see them with my ancestors, but the piles of urine and feces inside the enclosure made it impossible for viewers to stay for long.</p>
<p>Deer are easily startled. When they live in groups, they surround themselves with their antlers, forming a circle like a formation, to protect themselves from harm from people. See "Miscellaneous Notes of the Three Leftovers."</p>
<p>"New Qi Xie" says, "Lin'an produces deer. They give birth to their young around Qingming Festival. The young must wait for rain before they can walk. If there is no rain, they cannot walk at all. Scholars who find them take them home and feed them sheep's milk. When they grow up, they follow the sheep, called 'sheep-milk deer.'"</p>
<p>Old deer can grow jade in their antlers after many years, called "deer jade," also known as "deer jade." "Qing Wang Yingkui's Continuation of Willow South Notes" records, "Yu Chenglong was a Sima in Huangzhou. A wild man presented him with a dead deer, as tall as a horse, with large and mottled antlers. A silver ring was tied around its neck, weighing seventeen taels, engraved with the seven characters 'Huaqing Palace, Tianbao Second Year.' The bottom of the antlers was solid and transparent like jade, which is what is called 'deer jade.'"</p>
<p>Deer meat is delicious, but not easily obtained. Those who have eaten it say that its taste is far above that of roe deer meat. Its fur can be used to make brushes, hence the famous deer hair brushes.</p>
<p>"Meaning of the Rites of the Book of Rites" says that the people of Yizhou kill deer and bury them in the ground to let them rot, then take them out to eat. This is called "deer [unclear character]," also a strange way to eat deer.</p>
<p>Deer tails and deer tendons are both precious ingredients in dishes, but they are not easy to prepare well. "Suiyuan's Menu" once recorded the method of cooking deer tendons: "Deer tendons are difficult to soften. They must be pounded and boiled three days in advance, squeezing out the gamey water several times. Add meat broth to simmer them, then use chicken broth to simmer them. Add a little soy sauce and wine, thicken the sauce, and do not add anything else. They will become white and can be served on a plate. If you use ham, winter bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots together to simmer them, they will become red and are served in a bowl without thickening the sauce. White ones should be sprinkled with fine peppercorn powder." Today, there are few who speak of the method of cooking deer, so I have recorded it in detail. Those who want to enjoy a delicious meal, why not try it?</p>

<p>Rich people talk about eating and drinking all day long, while poor people worry about eating and drinking all day long. That's life.</p>

<p>Students in schools are "imprisoned" in class every day, and teachers are "repaying debts." When the holidays come, it is when the students' "sentences" are over and the teachers' "debts" have been paid off.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Five Mounds Six Families Village <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>"Five Mounds Six Families Village, wives support men,"</p>
<p>"Men gamble with cards, women carry salt to sell,"</p>
<p>"Five Mounds Six Families Village" is a village by the sea. The coastal residents mostly take "salt drying boards" as their main business, and farming as a byproduct. Salt drying boards are first used to filter seawater into clear dew, then the clear dew is placed on wooden salt boards, and the salt boards are placed on "mounds" to be dried in the sun. After a considerable period, it becomes the table salt we use every day. As for the fields there, because they are close to the beach, the soil is not very fertile, and there is often the danger of seawater flooding, so although they generally work hard to cultivate, the harvest is always limited. Therefore, their lives mostly depend on the income from salt drying, and what they get from farming is only used to supplement it. Of course, they also hope for a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>Salt drying and farming are of course both laborious occupations, and they cannot be slackened off at all. According to the general custom in China, men take sole responsibility for this, and women are only in a supporting position. However, in this "Five Mounds Six Families Village," it is exactly the opposite. Women take responsibility for all the heavy work, and men only follow them to clean up all the trivial and easy tasks. Therefore, the nearby residents gave them these two strange sayings under strange eyes: "Five Mounds Six Families Village, wives support men"; and when they are free from work, the women carry the dried salt to sell in other places, and the men, on the other hand, stay at home and gamble with cards for entertainment. Therefore, there is also the saying "women sell salt, men gamble with cards."</p>
<p>Therefore, the women in the "Five Mounds Six Families Village" are mostly rough, dark, strong, and big-footed, meeting the aesthetic conditions of modern times.</p>
<p>Although this kind of life is too deformed, we cannot but give considerable praise to their perseverance and determination to "earn their own living," and recognize that this is what modern liberated women should emulate.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Impression of Wen Kegang's Calligraphy Exhibition <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Gong</p>
<p>I have long heard that Mr. Wen Yiru of Lingnan is devoted to calligraphy, and he has studied the inscriptions on bronzes, tripods, Qin and Han stone tablets, as well as the calligraphy of various masters since the Jin and Tang dynasties. Every time he copies them, the spirit and charm are very lifelike, which is highly praised by contemporary scholars. Yesterday, I visited the calligraphy and painting exhibition jointly held by Mr. Wen and Mr. Wu Gonghu at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road. I truly felt that the walls were full of exquisite works, and it was too beautiful to describe. Just talking about the various copied works, Zheng Yuan said that his copy of "Stone Gate Ode" captured the essence of the original. Pan Feisheng (deceased) said that his spirit was wonderfully in tune with the ancients. Ye Gongchuo said that his copy of "Zhang Qian's Memorial Stele" uniquely captured its composure. Tan Zekai said that he deeply understood the essence of it. Zhou Zhenlin said that his copy of "Jing Jun Stele" was extremely commendable and worthy of admiration. Pan Feisheng said that his copy was exceptionally refined and made people yearn for it. Ye Gongchuo said that his copy of "Fragmentary Han Tablet" was described by people in the past as "like iron sinking into jade," which is the best description. I also say the same about this copy. Zheng Yuan said that his copy of "Zhong Wang's Running Script and Regular Script" corrected the vulgarity and directly entered the room of the Jin people. Zheng Yuan said that his copy of "Wang Xianzhi's Post" not only resembled the shape but also captured the spirit. Chuan Shaoyan said that he deeply understood the spirit of the Great Order. Wang Xishen said that he transcended the outward form and captured the essence. Huang Binhong and Fu Shaoyan both said that his copy of "Han and Jin Cursive Script" captured the spirit. Yang Shukan said that his copy of "Wang Xizhi's True Writings," especially the "Mid-Autumn Post," was extremely lifelike. It can be said that he has a high talent and has put in the deepest effort. It cannot be compared to the copies of his contemporaries. I can only admire him. The gentlemen are all famous figures of the same era, and they have never had the habit of self-promotion, but they highly praised Mr. Wen's calligraphy, which shows the depth of his attainments. Mr. Wen's exhibition is actually set up to help disaster victims. I secretly hope that those who are interested in this art and want to feast their eyes and show their elegance should not miss this good opportunity.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Because we can't wait until that time, the Emperor has to rush back to Beijing to preside over the grand ceremony of worshiping the ancestral temple!"</p>
<p>While the Empress Dowager was sighing like this, Guangxu and I were also standing beside her. When he heard the last sentence, he couldn't help but shrug his shoulders slightly, as if he was very reluctant to listen. Indeed, the views of this prisoner-like Emperor were quite good! He has always opposed the boring acts of burning incense to worship Buddha and offering sacrifices to Heaven and ancestors! He especially disagreed with spending a lot of energy, time, and money on ceremonies to commemorate or pay tribute to those who have already died. This kind of thinking was truly unique among the nobles at that time! This day, after work, he found a chance when no one was watching and quietly said to me:</p>
<p>"Since we are in charge of the affairs of a country, we cannot spend most of our time on such meaningless sacrifices... We should shift our eyes and use all our strength to build a strong army and navy, which is what we should do. Remember the other day when we went to visit Fox Immortal Pagoda together, the Old Buddha had a lesson for you, you probably haven't forgotten it, right? You might as well honestly tell me, can you really believe it?"</p>
<p>What he was referring to was that the other day, I accidentally showed distrust of the Green Fox Immortal in front of the Empress Dowager in the Fox Immortal Pagoda, which led to the Empress Dowager's rebuke. In fact, this matter has left a deep mark on my nerves, how could I forget it?</p>
<p>"That thing? The Old Buddha just told me to kowtow a few times!" (232)</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<h3 id="e149">Suzhou's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu [unclear character]</p>
<p>Suzhou is a good place where cultural relics gather. Besides the gentle, water-like women, calligraphy and painting masters have also emerged from generation to generation, decorating the paradise-like Suzhou with a civilized atmosphere. Recently, the Suzhou calligraphy and painting groups, besides the Zheng Society exhibiting in Nanjing, also have a "Suzhou Calligraphy and Painting Society." The people in charge of the society, such as Mr. Chen Jia'an, Wu Daiqiu, Gu Moyi, Fan Shaoyun, Liu Junran, and Zhang Yisheng, are all famous painters who are famous in Suzhou and Shanghai... This time, each of them has produced wonderful works to hold a painting exhibition in Shanghai, adding a scene of brocade and flowers to the cold and year-end Shanghai art world. It is truly not only a grand event in the art world but also a feast for people's eyes.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Calligraphy and Painting Society has been preparing for this exhibition in Shanghai for a long time. In order for the people of Suzhou to appreciate it, an exhibition was held in Suzhou in the middle of last month. The opening days were truly crowded with viewers, who unanimously praised it. Half of the works in the exhibition were booked. Therefore, the people in charge deeply felt that these paintings were not enough. After the closing, the painters all worked hard to produce more, but because the mounting took time and the rain continued, it was not until recently that the weather turned sunny, and the painters' works were all mounted. Therefore, it was decided to hold the exhibition at Tianyi Society on Sanma Road from the 26th.</p>
<p>In the society's exhibition paintings, the works of painters Chen Jia'an and Liu Junran are displayed the most. Mr. Jia'an's paintings are famous throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. His brushstrokes are so elegant, but the flowers, birds, and feathers he writes are both in shape and spirit. This time, he produced more than twenty works, with flowers, birds, landscapes, and everything. In one painting, there are chicks under the fence, flowers all over the frame, grass like a carpet, and several yellow chicks pecking for food, as if they are about to jump off the paper. He is truly a master of sketching.</p>
<p>Painter Liu Junran is Mr. Jia'an's disciple. His brushstrokes and layout have already become his own style. His fruits are regarded as the best in the Suzhou art world. In this painting exhibition, Liu Jun specially painted two sets of four-season fruit screen strips, with peaches, plums, water chestnuts, lotus roots, and other things arranged in a chaotic manner. Not only are the shapes very similar, but the layout and structure are also full of charm. As for the "Nine Autumns" hanging scroll, the brushstrokes are also delicate and full of spirit.</p>
<p>Painter Wu Daiqiu's landscapes and fruits have long been famous. This time, he also had a great interest in drawing several flowers and fruits, with old brushstrokes, as if they were the works of Old Can. There is also a green landscape painting, with layers of peaks towering, and lush trees. The layout is dense, but the charm is leisurely, truly what is called dense but not boring. At the top is also inscribed an ancient poem: "Green mountains follow the passenger boat, one turn of the stream, one bend; the stream is shallow and deep again, the mountain traces are broken and continued. Low trees hinder the sails, dense reeds hide the fishing huts. The smoke and water are deep with each other, and the sky is bright and green for several miles. Knocking on the side of the boat and singing the water chestnut song, I intend to enter the West Stream to stay; a small stop near a dangerous bridge, startled gulls rise and return to the whirlpool." The spirit is full of charm, which can be called two beauties.</p>
<p>Old painter Mr. Gu Moki is a disciple of Mr. Lu Lianfu. His figures and landscapes are extremely fine. When the book painting society held an exhibition in Suzhou, Mr. Gu specially drew an eight-foot hanging scroll "Taoyuan Asking for Ferry Map;" the landscape is smoky, the trees are towering, and the pavilions are scattered, embellished with yellow-haired children and peach blossoms, putting the scenery of Taoyuan all in the square inch. Mr. Gu, with a flower armor age, rushed to this large painting, which led to overwork. It is a pity that this painting was purchased by the Beizhai of the Lion Grove after being displayed. In this painting exhibition, Mr. Gu only has a five-foot hanging scroll on display.</p>
<p>In this exhibition, Fan Shaoyun's landscape hanging scroll, Wu Ziding's figures, landscape screen strips, Gu Yanping's landscape vertical axis, Shen Lizhi, and Fan Ziming's landscape hall screen are all famous works. My friend Zhang Yisheng is a disciple of Mr. Chen Jia'an. Recently, he often asks Mr. Wu Daiqiu for advice. His landscape has indeed developed rapidly. Those few foot pages are very similar to Shan Gu and Lutai. It is a pity that the fame is too heavy, and the blue shirt is sluggish and frustrated, but his paintings are indeed appreciated by all.</p>
<p>There are also two young painters in the painting exhibition, Wu Yisun and Lu Yifei. Yisun's paintings are good at both landscape and feathers, and his brushstrokes are extremely fine. Lu Yifei's four beauties, lotus picking, and yarn washing paintings are beautiful and the colors are elegant. The four poems are also different from ordinary.</p>
<p>My friend Cheng Xiaoqing also had a great interest this time and specially drew three small paintings to be displayed in the exhibition. In one painting of plum blossoms and double feathers, a tree of plum blossoms, the teacher Jia'an also cooperated to make up for it, which added a lot of color. As for the calligraphy couplets, the calligraphers Xiao Tuige, Jiang Yinqiu, and Jiang Qifan also have works on display, which are very worth seeing.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Points to Note When Using Electrolytic Capacitors <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>There are two kinds of commonly used large capacitors, one is paper capacitors, and the other is electrolytic capacitors. Among these two, the latter is easily damaged, but the price is low and it takes up very little space. Therefore, it is especially popular recently. It can be said that most of the large capacitors in imported radios are electrolytic. However, electrolytic capacitors can also be very durable if used legally. The following are some points to note when using them:</p>
<p>1.  Withstand Voltage Strength Each electrolytic capacitor has a specified withstand voltage strength. It is absolutely forbidden to exceed it during use, otherwise the internal insulation material will be broken down and a short circuit will occur. It is safer to reduce the quantity than to use it. The withstand voltage strength of the filter capacitor in the filter circuit of an AC radio should be at least 1.4 times the secondary high voltage of its power transformer. For example, for an electrolytic capacitor with a specified voltage of 500 volts, the secondary voltage should not exceed 350 volts. (350 multiplied by 1.4 is 490, which is about 500 volts.)</p>
<p>2.  There are two types of electrolytic capacitors: dry and wet. Wet ones have more leakage, but they can withstand occasional voltage increases in the circuit. The latter will be damaged once the voltage is high. Therefore, wet electrolytic capacitors should be used in places where the voltage changes frequently, which is safer.</p>
<p>3.  Electrolytic capacitors have two wiring heads, which have positive and negative poles. It is absolutely forbidden to make mistakes when wiring, otherwise it will be damaged immediately.</p>
<p>4.  After electrolytic capacitors are left unused, the internal insulation will gradually disappear. Before reusing them, they should be used under low voltage for a few minutes, so that the lost insulation can be regenerated by itself; it is safe to use.</p>
<p>5.  Electrolytic capacitors should not be placed in high temperatures, because high temperatures may shorten their lifespan.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Quick Verification Method for Short Circuit of Power Transformer <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Once a short circuit (Short Circuit) occurs in the coil of the power transformer, if you do not have a precision meter at hand, it is difficult to measure and verify it for a while. The method described in this article does not require specialized instruments and complicated procedures, and can find out the location of the coil short circuit for you in a very short time.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, T is the power transformer and L is the commonly used light bulb. During measurement and verification, first take out all the vacuum tubes in the radio completely, and then turn on the switch SW. At this time, carefully observe the light bulb L as follows:</p>
<p>(1) No light at all: It proves that the secondary coils are all intact, and the design of the transformer is also very good.</p>
<p>(2) Red light: It proves that a short circuit has occurred in the low-voltage secondary coil, or a small part of the high-voltage secondary coil has a short circuit. (If there is very dim light, this is the inevitable loss of ordinary transformers, such as eddy current loss (Eddycurrent Loss), etc., and it is not a short circuit of the secondary coil, so be careful.</p>
<p>(3) White light: It proves that a short circuit has occurred in the high-voltage secondary coil.</p>
<p>(4) Sometimes bright and sometimes dim: A short circuit is about to occur in the secondary coil.</p>
<p>If a short circuit occurs in the primary coil, the secondary coils will immediately exceed the normal value, which is easy to observe. If there is a broken line or touching line in each coil, it is even easier to measure and verify it with a voltmeter or stethoscope in series with a battery. This article is to save space, so it is omitted here.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Discussion on Using High-Power Tubes to Make Single-Tube Machines <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zipei</p>
<p>Reading the article "Improvement of Using High-Power Vacuum Tubes for Detection" by KMK in the 98th issue can reduce distortion and stabilize the tone, which can be used as a reference for general enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The amplification coefficient of high-power tubes is very large. When used for detection, the volume is no less than that of ordinary two-tube machines; however, the power consumption is extremely large. For example, for the battery-type 33, the filament voltage needs 2V and the current needs 0.26A, a total of 0.52W. A small 25A battery needs to be charged after 40 hours of use; and the B voltage needs at least 45V to 90V, and the screen heat and grid heat need a total of 17.5MA. The B battery sold on the market is less than three amperes. It must be replaced with a new battery after a maximum of 200 hours of use. The monthly cost is about three times more expensive than energy-saving tubes; If 42 or 2A5A are powered from AC power and B power is used with dry batteries, the monthly cost will be four times more expensive than energy-saving tubes. If all AC power is used, the monthly maintenance cost is lower, but the installation cost is more expensive, which is not very cost-effective.</p>
<p>In summary, using high-power tubes for detection is better than energy-saving tubes in terms of effectiveness, but the monthly cost is also considerable.</p>
<p>The circuit of MKK uses three or four lines, and it is unquestionable to use a variable capacitor to adjust the screen circuit. However, if it is changed to the Hartley connection method, that is, the secondary circuit is connected to the screen circuit, and the screen current is still adjusted by a variable capacitor, the feedback force can be more stable, and the wiring is more convenient and the effectiveness is reliable.</p>
<p>The resistance of the grid heat should be larger for radio stations with shorter wavelengths, and smaller for radio stations with longer wavelengths; the adjustable resistance can be adjusted to the most pleasing point; and a small-capacity fixed capacitor is connected across both ends of the headphones or speakers, then the sound quality can be improved a lot.</p>
<p>When using high-power tubes or five heat tubes, the most important thing to pay attention to is: do not turn on the power when the screen circuit is not connected, otherwise the grid heat will be damaged, and the effectiveness will be 90% or 80% reduced when it is used later.</p>
<p>I have previously disassembled and assembled 2A5, 33, 58, and 42 several times, and I am convinced that the effectiveness is not bad, so I specifically bring it up to inform the enthusiasts.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Continuing the Method of Protecting Diaphragms <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Weiqiao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. A Feng's method of protecting diaphragms in the 98th issue of this publication, I couldn't help but recall my own sound methods for properly protecting diaphragms. As earpieces are necessary components of ordinary radios, the proper protection of diaphragms is extremely important.</p>
<p>For newly purchased earpieces, one should simultaneously purchase mica sheets (commonly known as thousand-layer paper) from wireless radio materials shops or hardware stores. One sheet can be divided into two pieces, costing only five or six copper coins. Cut the mica sheets to the same size as the diaphragm, and glue them around the edges to form a single sheet. After the glue dries, screw it into the earpiece cover. This will not only permanently ensure that the diaphragm will not rust or become contaminated, but also increase sound transmission efficiency. Readers may wish to try it.</p>
<p>If you find that the diaphragm has already rusted, first carefully scrape off the rust with a small knife or sandpaper, then wipe it clean with cotton dipped in methylated spirits. After drying, apply pencil lead to the rusted area to prevent further rusting.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Varieties of Detection <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>The radio waves emitted by transmitters have extremely high frequencies that cannot be heard by the human ear. Therefore, a detector must be used to rectify them into audio frequencies. The detectors currently used on the market can be divided into two types: crystal detectors and vacuum tube detectors. Crystal detectors lack selectivity and amplification capability, which is their only drawback. However, because they are cheap to install and inexpensive, people are happy to use them. Vacuum tube detectors are more widely used, and thus come in more varieties, roughly divided into five types: grid leak detection (Grid leak and Condenser detector), grid bias detection (Gridbias detector), also known as plate detection, half-wave detection (Half Wave detector), full-wave detection (Full Wave detector), and push-pull detection or Class B detection (Push Pull detector or class B detector). The five types of detection are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Grid Leak Detection || This type of detection is composed of a high-value resistor and a capacitor, as shown in Figure 1. R is a 2-megohm high resistance, and C is a 0.00025-microfarad fixed capacitor. Its function is that R allows the grid to obtain a considerable negative voltage, while C allows high-frequency waves to easily pass through to the grid. RFC blocks high-frequency waves from flowing into the audio frequency section. C is a bypass capacitor with a capacitance of 0.00025 microfarads, whose function is to allow high-frequency waves to flow back to their original location. Grid leak detection is the most widely used on the current market because of its excellent sensitivity, surpassing other types of detection, and also has good selectivity. However, the plate voltage should not be too high, because the voltage that the grid receives is limited. Too high will easily cause distortion when emitting sound, and too low will not cause oscillation. Moreover, after the resonant point, a "whistling" sound that is most annoying to people will occur in the speaker or earpiece. It is acceptable for oneself to hear it, but nearby radios are also disturbed. Therefore, this type of detection has been banned in European and American countries.</p>
<p>(2) Plate Detection || When using grid bias detection, the voltage that its grid should obtain usually depends on the voltage used by the plate. For example, if a #30 vacuum tube is used for plate detection, and its B voltage is 90 volts, then the C voltage should be 4.5 volts. If the B voltage is 135 volts, then the C voltage also needs to be increased to 9 volts. The sensitivity of this type of detection is inferior to that of grid leak detection, but the oscillation is more stable, and the adjustment is simpler. Therefore, it is not commonly used in DC radios except for superheterodyne or multi-tube tuned radio frequency amplification.</p>
<p>In AC machines, this type of detection is the most common. Its power supply does not use a C battery, but uses a C-battery substitute. This C-battery substitute is composed of a resistor and a fixed capacitor. Vacuum tubes with cathodes are connected to the cathode, as shown in Figure 2. R is a bleeder resistor, and C is a fixed capacitor. Vacuum tubes without cathodes, such as #47, are connected to the center tap, but they are not commonly used for detection, as they easily cause AC hum.</p>
<p>(3) Half-Wave Detection. Figure 3 shows the half-wave detection circuit. V is a dual-grid triode, such as #55, #75, #85, 2A6, 6A6 vacuum tubes, or a dual-grid pentode is used for half-wave detection (such as #2B7, #6B7). The dual-grid portion is able to detect entirely due to its unidirectional nature, thus it can rectify radio waves. This type of detection is often used as the second stage of detection in superheterodyne radios, while the triode portion is used for amplification or automatic volume control.</p>

<p>— Jian Qin</p>
<p>▲ Earpiece Jack Wei Wei</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to check whether the circuit of the detection stage or a certain low-frequency amplification stage is intact, or for the sake of good listening etiquette, we want to use an earpiece to test the sound on a multi-tube DC radio. However, connecting and disconnecting the wires is very troublesome. To avoid this trouble, we can conveniently use an old vacuum tube base, with two binding posts connected next to it. These two binding posts are prepared for connecting the earpiece terminals. The wiring is as shown in diagram A. This is a very convenient earpiece jack. When using it, just plug it into the tube socket of any low-frequency amplification tube (the original amplification tube is of course removed). In other words, this jack is used to replace the original amplification tube, but it is only not suitable for replacing push-pull amplification tubes.</p>
<p>▲ Shortwave Plug-in Coil Tube</p>
<p>We often use old vacuum tube bases for shortwave plug-in coil tubes for economic reasons. However, when the number of coil turns is large, the space seems too narrow. We always want to extend the tube base. Usually, thick paper is used to circle the tube base, but this method has the disadvantage of unevenness. The best way is to make the base and the thick paper the same height, as shown in diagram B. First, circle a layer of thick paper in the tube base as the inner layer, and then paste another layer of thick paper outside the inner layer (if there is a ready-made battery case whose circumference is suitable for the tube base, then it can be placed on the inner layer). In this way, there is no unevenness between the thick paper and the bakelite base, and it becomes a cheap and high-quality plug-in coil tube.</p>
<p>▲ High-Frequency Choke</p>
<p>I believe that most people who play with radios know that when capacitors are connected in series, their capacitance is reduced. Similarly, we can apply this to the winding method of high-impedance coils. Therefore, commercially available products all use a segmented winding method, because this can reduce capacitance. When we wind our own high-impedance coils, we should also follow this winding method in order to obtain higher efficiency. For convenience, two wooden thread spools can be combined, as shown in diagram C. Wind about 500 turns of #36 enameled wire on this, each spool. If you want to be more precise, then each wooden spool can be separated into two sections with wood or thick paper that has been permeated with wax. Note that there is no need to seek neatness when winding, just wind it randomly, because this can reduce the distributed capacitance between the coils. When you connect it into the circuit, you will know that this high-impedance coil has a higher efficiency than ordinary ones.</p>
<p>▲ Dead Spots in Shortwave</p>
<p>In shortwave radios, sometimes dead spots are found. This is probably because the coupling is too tight. To avoid these dead spots, we can wind three turns of #18 enameled wire on the tube socket of the plug-in coil, with one end not connected and the other end connected to the antenna. This is equivalent to connecting an antenna compensation capacitor. However, the grid coil should be wound on the lower part of the plug-in tube, and the direction of the three coils should be consistent, otherwise it will not be effective.</p>

<p>Result: 45 to 18</p>
<p>Fudan's Morale Declines, Unable to Fight</p>
<p>The basketball team of Furen University of Beiping played against the Jiangnan champion Fudan team at Shen Garden last night, which was the second battle for the team since coming to Shanghai. Due to the frustration of the previous night, the northern athletes were all cheered up and determined to fight to the end, so as to regain their reputation, which led to the score leading all the way forward. Chen Zongqi, Fudan's most important guard, was unable to play due to eye pain. Zhou and Zhang both fought with illness, which made the defense a little lax. In addition, due to being eager to win, they were often too hasty, and the throws frequently violated their wishes. This is why they lost to Furen by eighteen to forty-five.</p>
<p>▲ Fudan's Morale Declines || The two armies line up, the center jumps the ball. After two or three rounds, Zhou Dayun holds the ball and shoots angrily, exploring the Furen basket for the first time. Cheng Jingxing repays the favor, and each hangs two points on the scoreboard. Li Yunzhong followed suit, and Li Baoshan added points again. Zhao Lingong did not fall behind. In an instant, they occupied the highest peak with eight to three. Fudan was intimidated by this, and their morale was greatly reduced. Counterattacks were difficult to achieve, and the defense felt lax, allowing Furen to do whatever they wanted. At the end of the first half, Furen had twenty-two points and Fudan had eight points.</p>
<p>▲ Furen Does Whatever They Want || After a short break, the war started again, and Fudan tried to counterattack, and the battle was of course more intense. Furen set up a strict defense, and there were few shooting opportunities. This foul, that throw, the gains and losses were equal. After insisting for a while, Wu, Li, Liu, and Zhao gradually revealed their true forms, and the scores frequently increased and overlapped, and Fudan presented an irreparable situation. In the overall calculation, the two sides scored, Furen scored twenty goals in total, and five free throws, while Fudan only scored five goals and eight penalty points, which proves that Fudan's military appearance is declining. If based on past results, Fudan can have all the generals, and should not be defeated. As a result, Furen won with forty-five to eighteen. Tonight, Furen will play against the Wei Ming team at the same place at 8:30. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Qian Hangsu and a Group of Twelve People</p>
<p>The East Asia College of Physical Education in this city is serious about its operations, emphasizing both academics and skills. As a result, talents emerge one after another, and it is famous throughout the country. The school's women's track and field and basketball team has been working hard in training, without publicity, and its achievements are improving rapidly. In the last National Games, Shanghai won the women's track and field championship, which was largely due to the efforts of Qian Hangsu, Wang Huachang, and others from the school. In mid-October last year, the Jiangxi Department of Education invited the team to Jiangxi to perform competitions to promote women's sports in the mainland, and it also gave a deep impression to the local people with its excellent performance. This time, the Malay Archipelago and the Malaya Basketball and Volleyball Association heard of its name and specially telegraphed an invitation to travel south to perform. The school believes that women's sports for overseas Chinese also need to be promoted, and immediately replied to agree and actively prepared. It is now largely ready and will depart on the French mail ship Qinlabao at 3:00 PM today. The team has a total of twelve members, with Shan Qian Hangsu as the captain. In Malaysia, in addition to track and field and basketball competitions, there will also be other sports performances, showing the school's spirit of training students in all subjects, with no bias. It is expected that it will have a great impact on overseas Chinese sports. We wish the team success on this trip.</p>

In the first half, they were at a disadvantage with 9 to 1. As a result, they reversed the defeat with 21 to 14. The first, second, and third quarters were extremely tense. Black Hawk was unable to save the situation due to Liao Zhuyuan's four fouls. Otherwise, Two Rivers would be in danger. The B Team of Yiling defeated the B Team of Two Rivers by 20 to 17. However, the first half was still fierce in Two Rivers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Two Rivers A Wins Black Hawk On the field, Black Hawk immediately rushed and scored. In the first quarter, Two Rivers had three and Black Hawk had four. Although right guard Huang Peizhen was fouled out in the second quarter, they still had good contact and had the air of a long journey. Two Rivers was still not strong, and swallowed their anger with 9 to 11. In the third quarter, Hu Zuohuan of Two Rivers scored, and lost a point with 12 to 11. Unfortunately, Liao Zhuyun, the center of Black Hawk, was fouled out at this time, and its strength was greatly reduced. Although it was once tied with 14 points, Two Rivers had 16 to 14 in this quarter, and the four were crazily cheering. In the last quarter, Two Rivers was even more fierce, and won the final victory with 21 to 14. Two Rivers had many free throw opportunities yesterday, and the results were minimal due to the plucking of the pipa.</p>

<p>Gold Standard Price Long Stagnant, Yesterday a Slight Rebound</p>
<p>丨Steady Rise of One Yuan and Three Jiao丨</p>
<p>The gold market rebounded after yesterday's decline, resulting in a steady outcome, mainly due to banks' lack of selling interest. The exchange rate market tended to tighten, stimulating Hua merchants and the Dalian gang to cover their short positions. However, due to HSBC and Sassoon taking the opportunity to sell high, it ultimately became mediocre. Initially, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US were flat. The London forward silver price remained unchanged, exchange rates slightly contracted, and the French franc weakened further. As a result, the London spot gold price fell by nine and a half pence. Over-the-counter forward transactions opened, retreating to around eight yuan, then surged to over nine yuan as bargain hunters flooded in. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both the UK and the US remaining flat, and the customs gold unit falling by 1 fen and 1 li. The gold standard price retreated to 980 yuan and 3 jiao. The morning opened with lower prices, and although slightly weak after the opening, it rose to over sixty yuan due to banks' lack of selling interest and the tightening exchange rate market, stimulating buying sentiment. Despite fluctuations, it was soon learned that the official exchange rates of HSBC for both British and American currencies remained unchanged. Although HSBC and Chase Manhattan had supply, the buying interest of banks turned strong, the process tightened, and the gold market also sought more than it supplied. Major players aggressively covered their short positions, gradually rising. The Silver Equalization Tax was announced, remaining unchanged. A speculator named Luo suddenly came to cover his short position, at which time it appeared quite firm. Later, due to some selling by major players, but speculator Luo continued to buy, and the Dalian gang aggressively covered Dalian positions, so the exchange rate market remained tight. Although it fell, it was still easy to rebound. Later, banks took the opportunity to sell high, and Sassoon also slightly supplied, and the exchange rate market gradually stabilized. The buying sentiment in the market slightly subsided, and the supply side became active from time to time. Transactions had decreased, gradually moving downstream, once approaching sixty yuan. At noon, the market situation was mediocre, with a soft trend. The after-market turned from flat to stable, with fewer transactions but strong buying sentiment. Banks still had supply, and prices slightly decreased after the high. The Indian silver market initially reported fluctuations, presenting a wavering situation. After entering the market, major players aggressively sold, and retail investors panicked, once falling to sixty yuan. However, although Sassoon supplied in the exchange rate market, there was no special change. After the price dropped, there were many who bought to cover their positions. The Indian silver market's second report of a decline gradually rebounded, but the transactions were light, and the market situation was boring. Finally, the overall trend was mediocre, with limited ups and downs. The swap premium had risen to 9 yuan and 8 jiao, which was due to the forced posting by many parties during the settlement period.

Hengyu, Yongli, Fuyu, Yongding, Changda, Decheng, Tongyu, Runyu, Qing Yongyi, Feng Yonghui, Xiangyuan, Maoyong, etc. successively bought strips, gradually rising.

At this time, because the Indian silver market initially reported a small increase of 1 anna, Shunli still entered and had a wavering situation. Later, Qian Changxiang Honglilai sold, and retail investors pressed down, and retreated to sixty yuan. This price only had a few transactions. Heng Yu limited the disk to buy, Dafayong Yuanyongda Kang Shunlifuyu successively entered strips, and the Indian silver market second reported a small 2.2.1 anna, rising to one yuan.

<p>丨The Result is Still a Slight Increase丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua merchants' securities exchange was the last day of futures for this month. The market was relatively stable. Because generally there were no resources to buy, and there were no goods to be delivered, there was some coming out of cages to offset each other. Most are still short dominated. This kind of phenomenon is caused by the current observation bureau situation. Because, although there are many short positions, most are unwilling to deliver the spot goods. Therefore, although the state of instability is present in this environment, there is still a situation of being squeezed. The amount of squeeze, however, is not much. The trend is not that intense. Starting today, just trade for the month of February. The market should be calm. However, due to the long period of closure, there will still be many transactions that are closed. Yesterday's process: when the market opened in the morning, although the news was not good, the prevailing opinion was that it would not be difficult to fall sharply, and due to the settlement relationship, everyone wanted to organize their chips, and the content was more crowded with floating shorts than floating longs, so it was still in a squeeze situation. Most were good for five cents one jiao to four jiao. Large traders could not complete transactions, and the trend was quite chaotic. Secondary disk short covering was still common, and the price generally continued to rise uniformly, one or two jiao to four jiao or so. In the afternoon, the market opened, and there were still conflicts on the long and short sides. The price increases and decreases were very uneven. The 23 Customs Department for this month rose by seven jiao and a half at its highest. In the long term, there was generally no honor or disgrace. The demobilization of troops squeezed more positions. This month was still a small triangle, so its trend was no longer normal. The closing situation was flat, without much fluctuation. The market price result was slightly better, several jiao to one yuan or more. The total volume of transactions was approximately 25 million yuan in total. Here is a table listing the increase and decrease situation:</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 24th), the New York stock market declined slightly. Except for some preferred stocks, the trading was extremely stagnant, bland, and uninteresting. Public utility stocks were relatively strong, with no clear reason. The major stocks in various sectors did not fluctuate much throughout the day. General Electric remained unusually active, but due to long-term profit-taking, it fell by a small number of cents. In the bond market, except for public utility bonds rising, the rest showed mixed results. Small exchange stocks also rose and fell mutually. Chicago wheat was flat, with a total of 440,000 shares traded throughout the day.</p>

<p>Many Deliverers, Market Softens</p>
<p>丨Longs in Distant Months Continue to be Bullish丨</p>
<p>The yarn market remains in a calm situation. The situation this month is relatively soft. Due to the end of the year, the money supply is tight. According to market rumors, Tongcheng Company, which had previously been actively buying goods, will deliver 1,000 bales this January. Hengfeng Factory will also deliver 1,000 bales, and Changfeng will also deliver 1,000 bales. The buyer Mr. Wu alone will receive 2,000 bales. Mr. Wang and Tongji Company will receive 1,000 bales. The final disc was 183 yuan, which is 4 yuan lower than the price for December. However, whether the delivery will actually be made will not be clear until the delivery date.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster is Ordinary and Unremarkable.</p>
<p>At the opening of the bid yarn market, Indian cotton was strengthening, but the venue was still flat and without new signs. The market price fluctuated between two or three cents all day long. Spot yarn trading is even more dull. Although there are reports of factories stopping work early and delaying the start of operations, the market is disheartened, which shows the sluggishness of commerce. As a result, each month saw mixed increases and decreases, fluctuating one or two cents. In the afternoon, the yarn for this month was the last day. The receiving and delivering parties were mostly balanced. However, Mr. Wu continued to receive more than 2,000 bales of yarn, so the market price was still stable. As a result of the delivery, this month fell by six cents. Longs are still not relaxing on distant months, rising one or two cents. It was found that Yuda sold 350 bales, Shenchang 550 bales, Ruidai 650 bales, Dafu 650 bales, Hengde 350 bales, Tongxing 450 bales, Changfeng 650 bales, and Junchang 350 bales. Yuda bought 650 bales, Jinchang 500 bales, Tongfeng 600 bales, Mingde 700 bales, and Yichang 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day, as well as the closing prices, are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales are still quiet. It has been found that all groups bought a total of 465 bales on the full day. The market price is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>

<p>丨Final Transaction at Thirty-Six Yuan, Three Jiao, and a Half丨</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm. Due to the unabated rise in Indian cotton prices, bullish traders are holding tight, leading to a relatively strong market. Simultaneously, as this is the last day of the month, market rumors suggest that deliveries may be insufficient. Although 4,300 dan of goods have passed inspection, 1,300 dan of them may not be delivered for certain. Consequently, afternoon prices turned higher, but the closing price suddenly fell due to Mr. Wu selling 1,000 dan. The final transaction was at thirty-six yuan, three jiao, and a half, up two jiao and a half compared to the December contract.</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Bulls Persist　　The market opened higher before the bid for flowers, due to a slight increase of one to two points in US cotton and the continued rise in Indian cotton prices. The reason for the steady increase is attributed to poor harvests and adverse weather conditions. Most players have a highly bullish outlook on the future of Indian cotton. Therefore, cotton merchants are generally holding onto their positions tightly, unwilling to release them, leading to higher prices. All months increased by one jiao to one jiao and a half. In the afternoon, it was reported that Indian cotton fell by two rupees in the unofficial market. According to market sources, actual deliveries for the current month were only 2,800 dan, with many covering short positions. Buyers flocked in, and the market rose steadily. The highest price in the second transaction was thirty-six yuan and eight jiao. However, at the close, prices suddenly plummeted. It is said that Mr. Wu sold 1,000 dan of cotton acquired last month, causing the price to drop sharply by three jiao and a half. Even the subsequent months were down slightly by one jiao, resulting in a net decrease of one jiao for the current month and a drop of five fen to one jiao for the distant months. It is recorded that Dafu sold 2,800 dan, Ruidai 1,600 dan, Renfeng 1,700 dan, Shengyuan 2,200 dan, Yifeng 1,100 dan, Suilong 1,000 dan, Junchang 1,200 dan, and Hankang 1,400 dan. The purchases were Meiji 1,800 dan, Yudai 1,600 dan, Daji 2,400 dan, Gengfeng 2,000 dan, Shenji 1,900 dan, Yuanyi 1,200 dan, Yuanyu Chang 1,600 dan, Changfeng 2,000 dan, and Changhe 2,300 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for each day are as follows:</p>
<p>Cherry Blossom Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>January Contract 36.80 36.35 36.35 Down 0.10 38,900</p>

<p>Total 562,700</p>
<p>Amidst Shutdowns, Factory Demand Is Nonexistent　　Spot cotton consumption is gradually declining. Factories are suffering significant losses from spinning and are approaching the end of the lunar year, making early shutdowns inevitable. Therefore, there is no interest in purchasing raw materials. Sources indicate 400 bales of Yao cotton and 300 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Minor Fluctuations in Overseas Cotton Markets <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with a firm market, but due to the caution of dealers, activity was limited. Prices rose two to three points in each month due to consistent buying from domestic and foreign traders. Subsequently, the bullish momentum was difficult to sustain as brokers closed long positions. Spot market activity was sluggish. Only India inquired slightly about cotton with 7/8-inch fiber. The textile industry is weak, and factories are only buying cotton for immediate needs. The closing was firm, with the spot price unchanged and futures up one to three points. The British cotton market was flat, and dealers remained on the sidelines. The spot price increased by seven points, while futures fell by one to two points. Indian cotton initially rose due to large-scale purchases by market manipulators but then retreated due to selling by Japanese and local traders. Pingguoer rose by 2.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.25 rupees. (Original Telegram from the 24th)</p>

<p>▲ Market Gradually Picks Up... Each Month Rises by About Two Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, uniformly showed a rebound, with the quotation for foreign wheat, from Chicago and Canada, slightly better by about one jiao. When pricing, the market situation had already turned good. Although this month's delivery is imminent, some factory players still intend to deliver. However, the "ke bang" (客帮, referring to specific merchant groups) side slightly reduced their offtake, and the price difference was already large. New arbitrageurs gradually engaged in arbitrage, so the market gradually rose. By the afternoon opening, the market situation for this month remained flat, but the forward months gradually picked up due to the "ke bang's" actions. The difference between this month and February has reached five fen, the best arbitrage situation recently. As a result, this month rose by 1.75 li compared to the previous day, February to April rose by 2.5 fen, May rose by 2.75 fen, and June rose by 2 fen.</p>
<p>Regarding overseas wheat, the public increasingly believes that Canada will soon take action on its wheat surplus problem.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources of various "bang" suddenly became scarce again, with only about 6,000 shi arriving on the 30th. Sales were sluggish, and the shops in this street also suffered losses. Therefore, the price of high-quality japonica rice softened, and the prices of Su, Tong, and South Port japonica rice all saw a decline of five fen. Over 1,000 bags of late rice were transacted by Qingdao and Yantai merchants, and the market continued to be good, rising by several fen to nearly one jiao. Du Jian and Yin Bian Yuan, and other varieties, remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, boats arrived from Hexia, and the inland landlords of Jingye and Jidun suffered another break in the supply chain. Therefore, only a little over ten boats arrived. Sales of white japonica rice and white yuan were quite active, and thin rice became popular. Various sharp/pointed rice (尖) remained stagnant. The market price for high-quality white japonica rice was stable, while medium-quality rice was slightly tight by several fen. Bian Yuan rice was firm, and thin rice rose by one jiao. The remaining goods were stable.</p>

<p>客秈(Ke Xian) Goods Are Scarce, Price Increases by Over One Jiao</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Currently, it is the end of the year, and the market has been quiet. Yesterday, because inland merchants actively bought broken foreign rice, this street was also tempted. In addition to the existing broken rice, they also competed to buy "road goods" (路貨, goods in transit) and recently arrived broken rice. A total of 400 bags of existing broken rice were transacted, along with 750 bags of "road goods" arriving in three to four days, 100 tons for January delivery, and 1,000 tons for February delivery. Selling prices were all raised by several fen. Digestion of Saigon machine-milled rice remained weak, with only 300 bags of existing goods and 400 tons of futures transacted. The market closed steady.</p>
<p>客秈 (Ke Xian) In recent days, arrivals have been low. Previously, "ke hua" (客化, merchant digestion) was not strong, and the market was stagnant. Yesterday, in addition to continued purchases by this street, inland digestion was also very active. Furthermore, Chongsha merchants competed for purchases. However, existing stocks in the market were scarce, and merchants planned to hold onto their goods until the next lunar new year before selling. Due to the eager buying of the "ke bang," prices immediately rose by over one jiao.</p>

<p>In yesterday's miscellaneous grains market, only the local merchants were actually buying. Those not in immediate need were concluding their business. The total market saw over 500 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans transacted, priced at 3.82 to 3.69 yuan. There were also 100 bags of Hankou late soybeans transacted, priced at 3.6 yuan, and 300 bags of Shashi soybeans, priced at 3.69 to 3.65 yuan.</p>

<p>The sugar market trend remained weak yesterday. The association's price setting included the Sugar Industry Cooperative selling 10,000 bags of 24 coarse granulated white sugar for March-April delivery at a price of 2.675 Dutch guilders, up 1.5 fen from the previous increase. Furthermore, the original quantity of Guangdong coarse granulated white sugar was 1,360 bags, with a bid price of 18 yuan, down another 3 jiao. Only 50 bags of spot goods were transacted, and 300 bags of re-exported goods were transacted at 4.5 jiao above the spot price. The local factory's refined white sugar remained unchanged. Brokers offered Zhuang Qing at 10.34 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 10.1 yuan, 10 yuan, and Longgang Qing at 9.8 jiao, and lower grades at 6 jiao, for over 1,000 bags transacted. Because these goods would not be available until next Wednesday or Thursday, the offered price was relatively low.</p>

<p>Raw peanuts are trending steadily higher in Qingdao in recent days, and quoted prices here are extremely firm. Previously, prices rose by three to four jiao. High-quality Kaifeng peanuts once reached 8.1 yuan. Yesterday, merchants from Guangdong and Shantou imported another 500 tons. The quality of Kaifeng peanuts was relatively lower, priced at 8 yuan, Lanfeng peanuts at 7.7 jiao, and Xuzhou peanuts at 6.5 yuan.</p>

<p>French Morocco is a very large market for our country's green tea consumption. Last year, the amount of Chinese tea imported into that port totaled more than 320,000 boxes, which is very significant. According to news from that area, green teas such as Zhenmei, Lamei, Zhenmei, and Xiumei from Shangzhong Zhuang in our country, such as goods from Tunxi, Wuyuan, and Suian, have seen a sharp increase in sales due to the promotion of abstinence from alcohol by the Hui people on various islands. However, due to the poor harvest of agricultural products last year, the market is sluggish and tea prices have not risen. In addition, for the item of Tuzhuang Zhenmei, because some of the boxed tea shipped last year did not match the bottom (of the box), its reputation has been greatly diminished compared to the Zhuang goods from inland areas.</p>

<p>British Huisi iron of 112 pounds and 200 pounds are reporting low inventories, and new shipments are limited. Therefore, the circulation of goods in the market often cannot meet the demand. Due to environmental factors, the standard has gradually risen. The current price per box (calculated at 200 pounds) is estimated at 26.5 to 27 yuan, which is a good 5 jiao to 1 yuan higher than before.

<h3 id="e216">On Types and Heroes <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>In literary works, when the protagonist lacks typicality, they often become imaginary characters, a kind of dreamlike bas-relief. In the works of naturalistic and realistic writers, the protagonist must conform to actual people, comprehensively creating a type of active figure in real society.</p>
<p>Regarding typicality, it is not an abstract reproduction of the protagonist's character, but a concrete, living human being through the writer's progressive worldview. Often, many writers, loyal to everything in the present world, although able to meticulously describe similar, more typical characters, these characters are often trapped in an ordinary life, lacking courageous heroism.</p>
<p>In Chekhov's works, there are comprehensive protagonists of the melancholy era of Nicholas, doctors, or children. In Cervantes' Don Quixote, there is a humorous and exaggerated knight. In Turgenev's Rudin, there is the smooth-talking but always-obstructed Rudin. I believe these types indeed concretely represent the living humanity of that time, but in terms of their role in literary works, they are of little use. At the same time, in Shakespeare's four major tragedies, these typical protagonists concretely express the fate of the decline of the aristocratic class. Generally speaking, the former are all negative types, while the latter carry a positive nature. As for the protagonists in the works of romantic writers, they are not typical, but fantasies; to give the most obvious example, Dorian Gray in Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is the best example.</p>
<p>In past literary works and in the works of various writers today, I believe that although the reality of the protagonist has been recognized, and realists are not seen as mere mirrors, and especially attention has been paid to typicality, yet in terms of shortcomings, they still commit the rules of schematic formulas, and are ordinary rather than heroic.</p>
<p>The waterline author Glatkov said in his report: "As a shortcoming in our works, in the guiding places, there is a lack of creative, moving, and appealing typical images of human beings." Fadeev also said, "In the writing of modern protagonists, many have not yet been liberated from schematicism, and lack typical characters in typical events."</p>
<p>Indeed, regarding the error of schematicism, I can recall Xiaolin Duoxieer's "Numaziri Village." This novel is less of a novel and more of an iron formula, turning the protagonist's character into a figure cast from a schematic mold. This kind of description and creation may create an atmosphere of heroism, but it is no longer a real, living human being. To obtain a truly human and typical character, one must start from a living life. Resolutions and books cannot impart true character, they can only provide a mold for creating that life, but this is not true art.</p>
<p>We must take the progressive figures of the present era as the object of research and reflection, and we must understand what they live by, how they rejoice, what they dream of, how they love, what they grieve, what they fight for, and how they work, and what kind of thinking patterns they hold, and so on! Infuse these images with extreme intensity, make them shine, and mold them into levers of the advanced thought of our era.</p>
<p>According to the above writing method, I believe that the character portrayed will definitely be typical, and also a hero of the times. The hero here is not a hero transcending the times, but a "common hero" forged by the power of the masses (this phrase may be problematic). To give a practical example, Guo Ruhe in "The Iron Flood," Tiefensheng in "The Rout," and Davidov in "Virgin Soil Upturned," etc., all belong to this type of hero. We know that these heroes are not superhuman figures in history, or figures who open up the world by their personal strength, but figures who exert their personal abilities by instilling the will of the masses. Let me record a section of Serafimovich's analysis of Guo Ruhe:</p>
<p>"Guo Ruhe is a hero, and also not a hero, because if the masses do not make him their leader, if the masses do not inject him with ideas, then Guo Ruhe is a most ordinary person. But, at the same time, he is also a hero, because the masses not only inject him with ideas, but also follow him; obey him as they obey a leader."</p>
<p>Looking at this explanation, one can clearly understand the true face of the hero I am talking about. Such heroes not only increase the positive and real aspects of the work, but also do not lead to blind and ambiguous behavior. The type of Don Quixote, who boasts of being a hero and can fight windmills, will not be reproduced in today's literature. And the figure who is proven by a positive formula will probably no longer appear in his rigid posture!</p>

<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>One day, when the river was high, Ma Jiaju, a nineteen-year-old, cast his small net by the river. He puffed on a rolled cigarette, chatting with Aunt Lanxiang, a woman in her forties, who was washing clothes at the "dock." As usual, Ba Guan, the fourteen-year-old only son of the village chief, Master Ma, kept taking small stones out of his large pocket and patrolled the riverside. When he spotted a place to cast a net, he would throw the stones down. Because of this, Ma Jiaju and his companions often made threatening gestures at him, pretending to fight.</p>
<p>"It's not a joke if you hit my head. You don't even know how to swim, in front of the Dragon King of the Sea... Be careful, I'll tell your dad," Aunt Lanxiang, who was squatting on the stone steps by the water, looked up and warned.</p>
<p>"I'm practicing my eyesight; I'll switch to bullets later. ...It's okay if you die, when I become a big official, I'll build you a memorial arch," Ba Guan giggled and threw another stone at the woman.</p>
<p>Ma Jiaju suddenly spread his arms fiercely, picked up a blue brick, and chased after the thin little monkey. As if fate had set a trap, intentionally plunging the young fisherman into eternal misery, Ba Guan ran as if flying, running very far, and suddenly fell into the water...</p>
<p>Ma Jiaju cried out in shock, not knowing what to do. Later, when he made up his mind to jump into the water to save him, it was already too late. He bore a terrible charge and was sentenced to seven years in prison. And Aunt Lanxiang, because she told the truth to prove his innocence, got a purple fingerprint on her face, and had to pay for her own eye treatment.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the first time he appeared in the village was when he was surrounded and beaten by the waiters in front of a restaurant. After that, he was always cursed, beaten, and driven away by the whole village. There was no trace of the kind fisherman.</p>
<p>"In the past, people used power to crush you. Now, how are you going to answer them? Alas, I pity you, I pity your mother. If there is still justice in the world..." She looked up, a hopeful light in her eyes, looking at the thin, tall young man in front of her. "Counting, you're only twenty-eight years old, yes, a twenty-eight-year-old, at least there's still half of you left... On the day of the Tai Sui Festival, I'll make you a pair of shoes, so you can walk on the right path properly. Twenty-eight years old, um, it's not too late..."</p>
<p>The man stood up without any emotion, smiling slyly. "I'm going my right path now. I haven't had lunch yet, that cigarette lighter box can probably be exchanged for forty cents." He strode away, swaying.</p>
<p>The old woman squinted her eyes, staring at his back, and muttered to herself: "Poor, a fellow hated by everyone..." She hunched over and ran into the house, preparing to fetch firewood hoops to bundle up the scattered firewood.</p>
<p>When she came out, moving her small feet, which had been destroyed and recorded the ugly deeds of mankind, she found that her blue grain water pipe and her firewood axe were gone. She was stunned for a moment, then angrily, yet sluggishly, stomped her small feet. "A fiend who has lost all conscience, using your skills on an old widow." She shouted loudly, shielding her eyes from the sun, and looked around the streets and alleys. After a while, she called out to the empty alley in a more affectionate tone:</p>
<p>"Ma Zai, you conscienceless thing, you...you must come and get your shoes, on the day of the Tai Sui Festival, come to me to get your shoes!" (End)</p>
<h3 id="e218">Waiting <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>Morning. The season is early winter.</p>
<p>Outside the window is black. A pair of sleepless eyes look at the black, but for a long, long time, it is still black outside the window. I remember there are two lilac trees outside the window, a hemp rope hanging from the window, and a broken bowl for feeding the dog; but now the lilac trees are black, the hemp rope is black, and the broken bowl is also black.</p>
<p>Facing the window is the door, I also remember that the door is dark purple, but now the door is also black.</p>
<p>When will it be dawn?</p>
<p>The sleepless eyes are hungry, longing for sleep. If they sleep, they will wake up and see the sun, but this is naturally a luxury. Then, give up sleep and wait for the sun, but while waiting, it is still black outside the window.</p>
<p>It seems like it will always be like this, without rotation, without change, without different colors, without different sounds, like a stagnant pool, like a long rain, like a hot summer, like a hard journey. You have to be patient and endure this suffering. You hope that one day in a deathly silent pool, there will suddenly be ripples and the movement of aquatic plants; but in front of your eyes, it is clearly a stagnant pool, dead silence, dead decay!</p>
<p>That's right, you can't get rid of your impatience with the tedious and long rain. You hope that someday, will a bit of sunlight pierce through the millions of layers of dust-covered clouds. You think of the beauty of the blue sky, and the greenness of life under the blue sky; but in front of your eyes, it is clearly a patch of gloom, from dawn to dusk, there is always rain hanging in front of the eaves, and it seems that your heart is always wet.</p>
<p>I say this is like a hot summer, can you endure the oppressive heat? Recall the sweltering heat of Jiangnan this year. At that time, you could only beg the sky to bestow a thunderstorm, a breeze, or a cloudy day tomorrow. But the sky did not move a bit, as if it would always be so unfeeling. Your heart is burning with fire, and your soul is about to melt into a liquid!</p>
<p>I am also not overly using a difficult journey as a metaphor, because I have tasted the suffering of the steerage of a sea ship. In this place, you need a solid body and a tolerant personality to resist filth, suffering, and humiliation. There, you do not believe that time is moving. The ship says that it will arrive at its destination the day after tomorrow, and you doubt when is the day after tomorrow. Outside the round window, the size of a plate, it is always the sea, the sea, a sea so blue it is about to turn black.</p>
<p>The world is stagnant, with only one color, one sound. Before my eyes are stagnant water, long rain, hot summer, and a hard journey! I look at the black, black, black!</p>
<p>Didn't I say that the black door is facing the black window? Suddenly, the black door turned, and a child and the lights of the corridor outside the door appeared at the broken gap of the black door. The child put a bottle of milk on the table (my roommate is an undernourished young man) and gently closed the door.</p>
<p>After a while, I saw a faint glimmer of dawn outside the black window, but I doubted whether it was dawn yet?</p>
<h3 id="e219">Dusk at Tongguan <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jikuan</p>
<p>Three years ago.</p>
<p>On that sweltering summer day, as the sun kissed the treetops, my friend Mian'an and I arrived at the strategically important Tongguan Pass. The city wall perched diagonally on the hillside, its imposing presence striking. To the east, a motor road led to Hangu Pass; to the west, a motor road led to Xi'an. The Wei River flowed into the Yellow River here. Without a doubt, it was the key fortress of Shaanxi, and the gateway to Shaanxi.</p>
<p>We got out of the car for a short rest, then agreed to visit the city wall. The hillside was very steep, and the wall followed it upwards; we had to climb step by step, because the mountain and the wall were both steep. Halfway up, we looked around. Outside was a deep valley, and inside was a steep downward slope. One careless step would surely lead to being smashed to pieces. At this point, half the sun had already sunk below the horizon, and weak rays of light shone through the thin clouds, which made us even more fearful. However, we couldn't satisfy our curiosity without reaching the summit, so we summoned our courage and continued to climb. Indeed, my heart was filled with fear, a fear that made it beat erratically. Neither of us wanted to show weakness, so we silently pushed forward, finally reaching the peak of the mountain. Looking around, to the south were towering, overlapping mountain peaks, seemingly submerged in hazy clouds; to the north was the Yellow River, like a white ribbon, flowing from the distant, indistinct horizon to the distant, indistinct horizon. Standing before this majestic mountain pass and the torrential river, one couldn't help but feel how insignificant one was.</p>
<p>Time passed imperceptibly. A vast twilight enveloped us. We couldn't leisurely gaze at the mountains and rivers before us, or reminisce about past events in our hearts. We had to rouse our spirits and carefully descend step by step. Our motto was to move forward, not to look left or right, and we would safely reach our destination. As expected, as the night curtain fully opened, we returned to the quaint inn.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Dinghu and Feishui Pool <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Dinghu Lake, shrouded in a deathly silence, appears from afar as a tall peak standing in the clouds. At the foot of the mountain, one can hear the refreshing sea breeze rustling through the treetops, its uniquely beautiful melodies playing perpetually. When walking along the winding mountain path with its nine curves and thirteen bends, one can hear the always-pessimistic and mournful bells of the Buddhist temple, giving travelers the feeling that this is a secluded paradise. The lush green leaves block the spring sun, making travelers feel the coolness here. On the mountainside, with its ever-changing scenery, one can never get enough of the beautiful daytime views.</p>
<p>In Dinghu, one can see many historical sites. When Su Dongpo was exiled to Southern Yue, he often hid here and spent his days in solitude. Beside the natural beauty of Feishui Pool, in the pavilion, he wrote many poems filled with lament.</p>
<p>At Feishui Pool, which is over thirty feet high, a snow-white waterfall, four feet wide, pours down after tracing an arc. The rushing sound, like ten thousand horses galloping, reverberates across several valleys. The white water glistens under the warm sun. The deep, clear pool is a rare swimming spot in the hot summer.</p>
<p>However, as I silently leaned on the smooth stone slab, gazing at the sun in the sky, it stirred up endless thoughts.</p>
<p>This place is not the human world; perhaps it is merely a haven for weary misanthropes.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Human World (10) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>"Yan Yan, Mr. Jin is here."</p>
<p>Xiao Ju didn't answer Mr. Jin's question; instead, she shouted. The woman of the house hurriedly called from the west room:</p>
<p>"Please sit down in the east room and have some good tea."</p>
<p>Judging by this, he must be an important guest. We didn't receive such a welcoming and flattering reception. I thought I could see what kind of person this important guest, Mr. Jin, was.</p>
<p>"He's Korean."</p>
<p>As soon as this guest entered the room, I recognized his nationality. A Korean is just like a Japanese. No matter what clothes they wear, they can be recognized at once. However, I can't explain why. You can't say that Koreans and Japanese have certain features etched on their faces. Then I thought about his relationship with this family. He's probably the owner of this private opium den, a lackey of the Japanese. Xiao Ju brought him tea and cigarettes. His arrogant manner suggested that he didn't see any of the living things or inanimate objects in the room.</p>
<p>"This thing, he deserves a good whack on the head."</p>
<p>I was indignant and wanted to argue with him, dissatisfied with his pretense. Actually, we're all slaves of subjugated nations, so why hold onto such thoughts? But I was still angry with him.</p>
<p>"This is -"</p>
<p>So when Xiao Ju wanted to introduce us, I waved my hand to stop her. At this time, the woman of the house and my friend came in, one after another.</p>
<p>The woman of the house seemed to have forgotten about me, her customer. She didn't greet me but only exchanged polite words with the Korean, then asked him to give her another day of grace.</p>
<p>There must be a financial relationship between them.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Bank Investments to Aid Rural Areas <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese countryside has been gradually collapsing, a hard truth. Therefore, the urgent need for rural relief has become a pressing task. Recently, cries of rural collapse have arisen everywhere across the country. Following these cries is the call for rural relief. However, relief is still relief, and collapse is still collapse. Can rural relief be achieved by merely shouting a few slogans? No matter how grand the rural relief plan may be, to reverse the misfortune of today's countryside, it is necessary to work step by step in a practical manner; empty talk is of no use.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the banking industry in this city is considering investing in rural relief. Because the banking industry in this city, recognizing the economic decline in the interior, has been investing in relief with considerable success in the past one or two years. Since last year, all industries in this city have been extremely depressed, leading to a concentration of huge sums of money in the banking sector, which in turn has made lending difficult. At the same time, although investing in rural areas may have thin profits and be labor-intensive, it is reliable in terms of credit. Therefore, the banks have decided to strive to engage in rural investment starting this year. If rural management develops, all industries will progress accordingly. And the banks themselves will also be consolidated. This is very good news.</p>
<p>In recent years, the economic situation of Chinese society has presented a distorted development. On the one hand, due to the impact of the world economic panic and the blows of natural and man-made disasters, not only has the rural economy of the whole country been scorched, but also the general industrial and commercial sectors have faced financial difficulties. On the other hand, the banking industry has been booming and showing a unique prosperity. For example, last year, all banks in this city had considerable surpluses, especially the Central Bank and the other three banks. However, the result of the development of the banking industry is the excess of idle capital and the concentration of idle capital in cities. This is not only not beneficial to the national economy, but also detrimental to the banking industry itself. If the excess of idle capital can be used for the construction of productive enterprises, the declining productive enterprises of our country may not be able to develop because of it. However, the banking industry itself, due to various reasons, cannot transfer this idle capital to productive enterprises, but instead uses it for speculative transactions (such as real estate and public debt investments). In this way, not only do industrial and commercial sectors not receive relief from the banks, but also the future of the banking industry is not very promising. Therefore, although the banking industry can maintain a good situation on the surface during this time of economic depression, it is actually still unsound.</p>
<p>As for the plan now, if the banking industry wants to fulfill its own duties, it should broaden its horizons and put all the huge amount of idle capital it has absorbed not only in warehouses or used for illegitimate purposes, but as much as possible in supporting the construction of productive enterprises. This will not only give the banking industry's idle capital a legitimate outlet and enable it to develop day by day, but also give all industries, including agriculture, industry, and commerce, the hope of restoring prosperity. The country and society will benefit greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Reproductive Competition <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>People must get married when they reach a certain age; the reason for this lies in the need for "physiology." Even if limited by economic ability, it is not possible to hold the wedding as desired, the component of that "need" will not be reduced or weakened as a result. Isn't that so? In the big cities, news of "adultery" is constantly appearing? Isn't it constantly churning out new tricks?</p>
<p>However, some people, I don't know if they are deliberately playing dumb or intentionally blaming, have asked me this: "According to you, it seems that the highest expectation of marriage is 'physiology,' but young men in the countryside have not yet reached the time of 'need' in terms of 'physiology,' so why do they still have to get married?" This, it seems, is not worth raising, because the reason is too obvious.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether marriage is needed or not, the childbearing after marriage "is an inevitable natural phenomenon," although many people are suffering, crying, and even grieving under this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Really, having children after marriage increases the burden, and when the burden becomes too heavy, it can stifle the breath, and you can't turn over like falling into a bale of cotton. So the heart is regretting, not marrying so early, but what's the use of regretting?</p>
<p>Friends, practice abstinence and reduce our burden a little!</p>
<p>I had to let out such a sigh. However, people are, after all, animals with spirituality, the most sensitive animals with spirituality. When you feel regret, you will "hate" it, but when you stop being dominated by physiology and are in need, the previous hate will disappear without a trace. "Abstinence" and "birth control" will not exist, and maybe you will punish yourself afterward.</p>
<p>In order to cope with this established environment, it is shrouded in a layer of sad mist in the old ways. However, opening yesterday's newspaper, in Toronto, USA, Mrs. Panadu and Mrs. Ganey are working hard to produce for the sake of competing for Mr. Miller's "fertility bonus," and in order to show the speed of their production, Panadu boasts to Ganey that she has no chance of winning. Naturally, Ganey is also unwilling to remain silent, so she is "making persistent efforts." Really, counting from 1926, with a limit of ten years, then, there are only two years left until the deadline.</p>
<p>In the end, boasting is not the truth. Mrs. Ganey's rate exceeded Panadu's. She gave birth to eleven children in eight years, which cannot be said to be an amazing number.</p>
<p>But, what about when you check yourself again? Don't say "competition," even "preservation" seems not to be an easy thing!</p>
<h3 id="e224">Random Thoughts on a New Home <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Having lived in the core of Shanghai - in a house in a lane - for a long time, I am used to hearing the noisy sounds of the city from morning to night, and the cries of food vendors who disturb people's sweet dreams every night, regardless of the cold winter or hot summer. As time went on, I gradually didn't find them so annoying or noisy. Dawn and midnight have become a familiar habit, cutting through quite a bit of loneliness. Now, I suddenly moved to this small town a few minutes by car from Shanghai. The first night, what I wasn't used to and what I felt was cold and lonely was that I couldn't hear the familiar melodies of these habitual sounds. Because of this situation, I regretted it, as if I had done something big that was displeasing to my heart, and I felt restless and infinitely lonely.</p>
<p>That was the bad impression I got of my new home on the first night. I barely got more than two hours of peaceful sleep all night. It was as if I had suddenly been placed alone in a desolate mountain temple. The solemn quietness of the deep mountains and valleys made me unable to bear it, giving rise to a feeling of terror, scratching at my nerves, and not allowing me a moment of peace.</p>
<p>Occasionally, there were a few barks from farmhouses in distant villages, and the low sound of a steam whistle that was almost inaudible. These intermittent and weak, sad sounds did not reduce the feeling of loneliness at night. Those few unfamiliar barks were even more terrifying, as if they were the mournful groans of a weak soul suffering, making one's hair stand on end and shivering. Several times I heard these terrible cries, I had to cover my head with a blanket.</p>
<p>Before twelve o'clock, I could also hear the sound of trains rumbling by a few times. It suddenly shook my nerves, and I felt a little comfort, increasing the activity of my blood flow. However, this was very short-lived. After the train gradually went away, the situation returned to its original state, and the situation was even worse. It was as if a firecracker had been set off in a deep valley, leaving behind only a clearer emptiness and calmness, making my nerves suddenly lose their support, hanging in the air and unable to grasp the edge, so empty and unbearable.</p>
<p>The first night was really hard to get through. I simply suffered a night of injustice. The suffering of insomnia during that year of illness made me shake my head in fear whenever I thought of it. Other suffering can be endured, or it is very possible that I can get used to it after a long time? The only thing I worry about is that I am afraid of getting insomnia because of this situation. That sin is enough for me to bear. However, whether I can escape this unknown difficulty in the future is quite a matter of conjecture.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the situation on the second night. This is really a miracle - it is foreseeable that the discovery of this miracle may make my situation even worse. Can you guess what this miracle is? It turned out that it was about three o'clock in the second half of the night. As I was drowsy, suddenly, a sharp and extremely sad pig's cry pierced my ears. I couldn't help but be surprised, and my slightly peaceful nerves became restless again. The cries were initially high-pitched and sad, but after a while, there was suddenly a shrill, desperate cry, which was clearly the last struggle of that poor, stupid creature, and then there was silence. At this time, my nerves were so hard to bear that they were about to explode, and there was simply no way to calm down. Red blood, white knives, a struggling, trembling soul, the fierce, cruel, and disgusting face of a wolf - a tragic scene of a slaughterhouse was clearly presented before me. I tried my best to close my eyes, trying to avoid and stop this association. But the result of my efforts was even worse. What was struggling was no longer a pig but a person, and there was an extra bloody head, an open, pale mouth, dismembered limbs, and a steaming, bouncing, bright red heart... That's how I spent the night in a nightmare until dawn. The tragic cries also recurred intermittently until dawn.</p>
<p>However, things in the world are always to be manipulated by others, and there is no room for one's own will to control and choose. For this reason, although this new home has so many reasons why it is uninhabitable, there is nothing I can do about it, so I have to bite the bullet and live here.</p>

<p>The Yalu River weeps, the peaks of Baishan tremble. Compatriots in the Northeast are displaced, soldiers in the Northeast die. That side is our land, they are our friends. The rivers and mountains are broken, friends are dead and wounded. How do you feel in your heart? There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart, no greater grief than the loss of a country. The brutal enemy enters the gate, the brutal enemy runs rampant. How many treasures do you think have been lost? How many places do you think have been lost? Treasures are plundered, places are trampled, how do you feel in your heart? Friends caress your heart, have there been any deaths? Friends watch your country, on the verge of ruin. We have seas of hot blood, sprinkled on the lost places! For our compatriots, for national defense, we will never retreat even in death!</p>

<p>The Fan family in the ruined garden is in Pingyang. There are many fox spirits causing trouble. There is a Ning Sheng among them. He does not believe in demons and reads books. He came to the thorny place wrapped in a quilt. He is not greedy for wealth or lust. They all know that after eating, he lies by the window. There is a charming fox spirit appearing. Ning Sheng scolds her to go back. The fox spirit smiles and opens her mouth. She says that your family has wasted reading poetry and books. You have no understanding and hurt my ancestral virtue. You have not heard that Tu Shan helped the Xia God Wan. He guided the water to flow into the Huai River, and his merits were evident. You are reading books and misunderstanding the books. How do you know that my ancestors have merits? Ning Sheng listens. His thoughts are in turmoil. This matter is difficult to think about. He is ashamed of being ridiculed. The matter does have a historical record. Helplessly, he invites her into the room to be friends. Who knows that the character of a jackal is inherently unkind. He has not lived in the garden for a month. The thin Ning Sheng gets sick. It turns out that the fox demon's bewitching is poisonous in the heart. She is using the ruined garden as a place for lust. Ning Sheng soon suffers from consumption.</p>

<p>Living by the Stream by Liu Zongyuan</p>
<p>For a long time, I have been bound by officialdom. Fortunately, I was banished to this southern barbarian land. I idly rely on the farms next door. I occasionally seem like a mountain forest guest. I plow the dew-covered grass in the morning. I lean against the echoing stream at night. I come and go without meeting anyone. I sing a long song to the blue sky of Chu.</p>
<p>(Yuefu) Ballad of the Border by Wang Changling</p>
<p>Cicadas chirp in the empty mulberry forest, in the eighth month, on the Xiaoguan Road. Leaving the border and entering the border again, everywhere there is yellow reed grass. Since ancient times, guests from You and Bing have all grown old with dust and sand; do not learn from the wandering heroes, who boast about their fine purple horses.</p>
<p>Border Song by Wang Changling</p>
<p>Watering horses crossing the autumn water, the water is cold and the wind is like a knife. The sun has not yet set on the flat sand, dimly seeing Lintao. In the past, there were battles on the Great Wall, and I felt high-spirited. Yellow dust is enough for ancient and modern times, and white bones are scattered among the wormwood.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Who is the Highest-Earning Star in Hollywood? (Part 1) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>A movie star, besides investing himself in the film industry to earn money for himself and support his personal life, must also consider the employer who hires him, to make money for the company. The result of this earning is that he can enjoy mutual benefits. Some movie stars only have their own reputation and generous salaries. After filming, the company spends huge production costs, but the result is that the film loses money, and the company suffers. Conversely, some movie stars, although not highly renowned and not paid handsomely, can make money from the dramas they act in, and the company is happy to hire them. Such stars are very rare and valuable.</p>
<p>Although there are many movie stars in Hollywood, not all of them can make money for the company. Many are hired by a company solely for the sake of the star's face. If we can find out which stars can make money, we can predict their future fortunes.</p>
<p>Perhaps what we are about to say will surprise the general reader, but we may as well state in advance that the following figures are based on the latest American film industry annual publication. They have compiled a detailed table for reference, listing all productions that have earned over one million US dollars since the beginning of American cinema. From this table, we can see who are the highest-earning stars in Hollywood, because stars who can earn over one million dollars for the company are generally the most popular among the audience. It can also be said that such stars can stand in the film industry forever.</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor is the highest-earning star in Hollywood. Among the films she starred in, seven productions earned over one million US dollars for the company. Five of them were with Charles Farrell as her partner. In terms of this achievement, the dramas that Janet Gaynor acted in catered to the psychology of the general audience more than any other Hollywood star. Although the comedic star Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle once insulted the Chinese in the film "The Cook," which was not pleasing to our countrymen, he is the second highest-earning star in Hollywood to earn over one million US dollars. Among the films he made, five productions exceeded one million in revenue. The third highest-earning person to earn over one million dollars is also a comedic performer, Charlie Chaplin. At the same time, the late romantic lead Rudolph Valentino and Fox's mainstay Warner Baxter can also be ranked third with Chaplin. Each of the above three people has three productions with more than one million in revenue. The remaining stars who have earned over one million US dollars for the company in two productions include Edmund Lowe, Richard Barthelmess, Wallace Beery, the late Ricardo Cortez, Ronald Colman, Bebe Daniels, Dolores del Río, Richard Dix, the late Marie Dressler, Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Al Jolson, Dick Powell, Will Rogers, and Mae West. There are four stars – Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Katharine Hepburn, and Constance Bennett – each with only one production that has earned over one million US dollars.</p>
<p>Although this table lists seventy-three films that have earned over one million US dollars, we will only cite a few familiar to our countrymen to illustrate the reasons why they made money. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e232">Review of "The Private Life of Don Juan" <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Private Life of Don Juan 丨 Nanjing</p>
<p>Don Juan, this handsome hero of the Middle Ages, not only captivated many women in numerous romantic legends, but many young men also regarded him as the ideal typical warrior. Thus, Don Juan's fame had a great influence in society. Therefore, there was a silent film starring John Barrymore in "Don Juan," and now there is Fairbanks starring in "The Private Life of Don Juan," which is not without social basis.</p>
<p>Translated as "Beauty's Heart," "The Private Life of Don Juan," after "The Private Life of Henry VIII" and "The Rise of Catherine the Great," under the direction of Alexander Korda, is most successful in its merciless satire of this hero. Here, we are reminded of Cervantes' "Don Quixote," which mercilessly satirized the fallen knight. However, Pabst did not fully achieve this in the film. Don Quixote on the screen was given sympathy. But the Don Juan directed by Alexander Korda, unlike the "Don Juan" performed by John Barrymore, which praised and eulogized the great lover, aims to satirize Don Juan to the fullest.</p>
<p>Let us see how Don Juan's life is depicted here. In Spain, he is known as a great lover. He makes many young women betray their husbands and dedicate themselves to him. Just receiving a kiss from him is considered a great honor. Thus, under such great fame, there is the appearance of fake Don Juans by young rascals who fight to the death with the lover's husband. The real Don Juan's fame is thus extinguished. When a crowd of women mourns at the cemetery, our Don Juan is both amused and exasperated. It turns out that his honor is nothing more than a playful arrangement by people. Afterwards, he spends ten years of quiet time in a small inn under the guise of a fake general. Young women in their boudoirs recall his heroic appearance, and his biography is a best-seller, while the real Don Juan is constantly ridiculed or mocked. He is teased by old women, mocked by young maids, and treated like a father by another young woman. No one even plays with him anymore. Thus, he feels the loneliness of life. In years of bitter smiles, he shakes his spirit and hopes to transform the faces of the old into the brilliance of youth. But the dead young Don Juan is no longer understood by people. When he returns to Seville, the singer who once loved him passionately does not recognize him. He is embarrassingly mocked by women in the theater. Although his wife finally receives him, he deeply experiences the bitterness of life. What is revealed to us from these scenes is a bitter and laughing life. This Don Juan, from glory to decline, gives people some degree of sympathy, but this sympathy is emitted in cruel ridicule.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the director's technique, Don Juan is a comical character. When he has intimate meetings with women, every time it is the same few words of praise, which is no different from the fake Don Juan falling down the stairs. Especially the various things after he returns to Seville in his old age, to the point of climbing the stairs to have an intimate meeting with his wife, all show his pitiful comedy. After we have seen this film, the taste of life's bitterness heavily assaults our hearts.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, perhaps the director and screenwriter are slightly disorganized in the first part. But on the whole, it is still very successful. To illustrate this point, we can cite the charming dance of the dancer André, as well as the scene of many groups of black-clad women in mourning, the jealousy of the real and fake lovers, and Don Juan's expressions of being unable to cry or laugh, all of which can prove Alexander Korda's refined technique.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to the excellent photography and the combination of sound effects and scenes, we deeply realize the scenery of medieval Spain from the beautiful night streets, from the passionate songs of the ukulele, and from the daring women. Especially due to Merle Oberon's excellent acting, the dance coming down from the building is truly too captivating. As for Fairbanks' acting, it is quite insufficient. His rude movements are not enough to express the so-called great lover's dashing and affectionate nature. He is just a demon who teases women.</p>

<p>— Heng Yun</p>
<p>London Films in England produced the amazing "The Private Life of Henry VIII" in 1933 and discovered Charles Laughton's talent. In 1934, they produced "The Rise of Catherine the Great" and established Bergner's position in the art world. At the same time, Elstree in England resembled Hollywood in the United States, building a solid barrier. Whose achievement is this? I am afraid that if Elstree in England did not have Alexander Korda's directorial genius, the films of the Old World would not have attracted the world's attention until now. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The first and first-class martial arts romantic superstar since the beginning of silver history, the well-known Fairbanks, his success lies in fully performing the spirit of Bushido. Of course, the modern style is definitely not suitable for his unique personality. Therefore, masterpieces such as "The Three Musketeers," "The Thief of Bagdad," and "The Black Pirate" can only be tried by him. He could have lived leisurely in the forest, without having to wear a crown and long sword, agile and energetic on the screen. (According to the official divorce from Mary Pickford this time, it is the prelude to Fairbanks' marriage to a certain noblewoman in London. After that, Fairbanks may be knighted and enter the ranks of the nobility. Therefore, in the film "The Private Life of Don Juan," he is titled as Mr. Fairbanks.) But Fairbanks finally accepted Korda as the director (all of Fairbanks' films were directed by himself) and made "The Private Life of Don Juan," the secret history of the great lover of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Since "The Private Life of Don Juan" belongs to British filmmakers, it is regarded as the greatest film of 1935, so even the supporting roles have been carefully managed. They claim that the beauties in "The Private Life of Don Juan" are selected from the four corners of the island country. The heroine, Merle Oberon, is in her youth, and is the result of Fairbanks' several strict selections, while Binnie Barnes, Benita Hume, Penelope Dudley-Ward, and Joan Gardner are all famous stars in the film industry. As for the recording, location shooting, and processing intentions, they are all top-notch. Indeed, this is a major threat that Elstree in England has given to Hollywood in 1935.</p>

<p>In Shi Dongshan's directed sound film "Human Affairs," the role of the female lead was originally set to be played by Wang Ying. After filming several scenes, there was a sudden objection, saying that the personality was not expressed, and she was unwilling to play the role of an old woman. Shi Dongshan believed that Wang was unwilling to play this role, so he could not force it, so it has been changed to be played by Hu Ping.</p>
<p>Hu Tong's directed musical singing film "Elegy of Life" and Dan Duyu's directed sound dialogue song Tang film "The Night Before the Wedding" are both scheduled to be released around the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>Yuan Congmei's written and directed "The Storm" (that is, the name of "The Sacrifice" has been changed) will begin filming.</p>
<p>Yue Feng directed, Kang Na assisted, Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Yuan Congmei, Ye Juanjuan, Cang Yinqiu and others co-starred in the musical singing film "The Escape," and the result is imminent.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang's written and directed "Triumphal Song" will also begin filming.</p>
<p>Yan Youxiang and Zheng Yingshi went to southern China to inspect the business conditions of various theaters. Now Yan has completed his official business and returned to Shanghai, and Zheng is also about to return.</p>
<p>"The Night Before the Wedding" has achieved excellent results, and the sound, photography, performance, and directorial techniques have special achievements.</p>

<p>— Zhao Chu</p>
<p>The crowd gave Xiao a way back. Instead, he grabbed the troublemaker, lifted him high and threw him away. The troublemaker was thrown into the muddy river and struggled endlessly. Seeing that the situation was not good, and after being driven away by Qin and Xiao, the crowd dispersed. Hong Feng immediately stepped forward to thank Qin and Xiao. After Hong Feng and Qin Xiao met, Yang Xiuqing also stepped forward. Hong clasped his hands and thanked them: "Thank you both for your great help, otherwise we would have been besieged." Qin replied: "I saw that they were too arrogant and unreasonable, and I was afraid that you would suffer, so I came out to help." Xiao also replied: "I am always ready to fight for justice, what is this?" Hong Feng was very humble and greeted them, saying: "It is rare for us to meet today, please sit in the hotel in front for a while."</p>
<p>Wine cups and dishes were placed on the table, and half of them had already been eaten. Hong Feng, Qin Xiao, and Yang sat together. Hong raised the filled wine and persuaded everyone to drink a cup. Then Hong put down the wine cup and continued to say: "So although I have experienced these setbacks, I do not retreat. Now the most important thing is to wake up the compatriots who are sleeping in dreams." Qin Rigang, after hearing these words, said with joy: "Mr. Hong's words penetrate into my heart. I am willing to follow you for life as an ordinary soldier." He immediately stood up, walked to Hong's side, bowed and knelt down. Hong repeatedly stood up and asked him to sit down. Xiao Chaogui also cupped his hands and said: "I, Xiao Chaogui, have a lot of strength, but nowhere to use it. If Mr. Hong looks up to me and can use me, there will be a place to spill my blood." Hong Feng repeatedly thanked them, saying: "Thank you for your kindness, but I hate that I am incompetent and unworthy, and I dare not accept it." He then raised his cup and persuaded everyone to drink another cup. Yang Xiuqing put down his cup, pondered for a while, and said to Hong Feng: "You two should have a base of operations now, so it will be easy to develop." Hong sighed and said: "This is exactly our difficulty. We are being watched by officials in Guangdong, and we are unfamiliar with the place in Guangxi." Yang Xiuqing then smiled and said: "I can recommend a place, which is at the home of Zeng Yuxuan in Jintian Village. He is a big landlord here, and he is also ambitious. He is unwilling to be an official and likes to make friends. If Mr. Hong is willing to go, I think he will be very welcome." Hong Feng listened, and both showed joy, saying: "This is the best. How can we not be willing to go?" Yang then nodded and said: "The opportunity is really a coincidence. This time we are escorting loan silver to his village. It is just right to go together." Hong was extremely excited when he heard this, and tied up his luggage, saying: "This is really a heaven-sent opportunity. Perhaps our career will be created here!" Saying this, Xiao Chaogui grabbed the wine pot and poured wine in front of everyone, and they all raised their glasses to congratulate them.</p>
<p>Hong Xiuquan settled in Jintian Village, and Zeng Yuxuan hit it off. Yang and Xiao also closed their security bureau and gathered in Jintian Village. Soon, they founded the Baoliang Bandit Suppression Association to plot major events together. On the side of the door of the Baoliang Bandit Suppression Association, a note was posted saying that the Baoliang Bandit Suppression Association was recruiting. Two tables were set up by the door, with many registration books placed on them. Many people came to apply and were registered one by one. Yang Xiuqing was monitoring, and Xiao Chaogui and Qin Rigang were checking the physique of the people who came, while chanting their names.</p>
<p>One day, Zeng Yuxuan, Hong Xiuquan, and Yang Xiuqing were sitting there discussing major events. Suddenly, a servant walked in and said: "A person has come outside and wants to see the master and Mr. Hong. When asked for his name, he refused to say." The three hesitated for a moment and said: "Go and invite him in." Yang Xiuqing immediately put away the registration books. Suddenly, a big man walked in at the door, with a very serious expression on his face, and said loudly: "You are using the name of the Baoliang Association here to recruit soldiers and buy horses, plotting against the imperial court. Aren't you afraid of being killed? You can deceive others, but you can't deceive me!" When he said this, his expression was very stern. The three of them were stunned by him. Zeng Yuxuan turned around to take the sword hanging on the wall. The man laughed loudly when he saw it and said: "You have good eyesight, but you don't recognize me, Shi Dakai?" Zeng put down his sword, and the three understood. Hong Xiuquan changed his face and smiled: "Are you Mr. Shi Dakai?" (To be continued)</p>
