<p>時評</p>
<h3>水泥工業之擴張</h3>
<p>— 磬</p>
<p>値茲不景氣籠罩全國。工商業極度消况之際。我民族工業之獲有優異業績者。捨水泥工業莫屬。查我國水泥工廠之範圍較大者。雖僅啟·新中國·上海廣東省營等數家。但以得天獨厚。年來日臻繁榮。若推本溯原。助其發榮者。實不祇一端。先就消費方面而言。近年國內建設事業之猛進。各地營造建築之蓬勃。使水泥需要。大量激增。次則水泥進口稅年年增高。洋貨水泥。無由貶價傾銷。國產乃得以獨占國內市塲。而無虞對外之競爭。至於生產方面。水泥製造。屬重工業。之一類。設備費用。頗有可觀。新廠創立。似非易易。是以水泥業雖以鶴立鷄羣之雄姿。儼然爲我衰疲之民族工業平添不少春色。然而其他工業之繼起發皇者。尙寂無所聞焉。</p>
<p>乃者國內水泥工廠鑒於新同業崛起之匪易。而最近數年可獲得空前之成績。於是各謀添置新機。擴充產量。例如唐山啟新洋灰公司。近擬以二百四十萬元之代價。在安徽方面。開辦江南水泥公司。以與華北母廠相呼應。廣東省營士敏土廠。則添設第二套新窑。使每日產量。自一千六百桶。增至二千八百桶。龍潭中國水泥公司。最近增資爲四百五十萬元。並添設新廠。擴充每日產量至四千桶。（原產額每日僅二千玉百桶。）至龍華上海水泥公司。亦增資爲二百萬元。並籌建第二廠。將生產量酌量擴充。</p>
<p>各廠之競事擴充。固爲我民族工業差可自慰之現象·但我人於此殊有未能釋然者。蓋水泥工業近雖蒸蒸日上。設國內之不景氣曠日持久。恐亦不免蒙受相當之影響。今各廠不問環境之若何而爭相擴充。以增其產量。則此後之生產過剩。殆在意中。抑就目前情形而論。各廠之售價雖有國產水泥營業所居中調劑。然同業間之貶價競爭。仍所不免。設或產量激增。供求不稱。營業出路之困難。勢將更甚於今日。前途之危機。殊難忽視。我人猶憶五六年前。國產水泥工廠皆曾飽嘗風霜。雖經掙扎苦鬥。而連年虧耗幾至一蹶不振。今者否極泰來。喘息方定。若以前車爲鑒。似宜於今次之擴張計畫。以愼重出之。</p>
<h3>寗爲自由死不願奴隸生　阿國抱抗决心　國王臨議會致訓詞　激勵士氣爲國犧牲　天時地利人和三者兼備抵禦侵略誓必奮鬥到底</h3>
<p>阿京　阿王今日臨貴族院發激昻之演說、甚能戚動人心、其中一節日、戰士乎、其效爾勇武先人之所爲、不分老少、協禦攻者、如有必要、爾王將爲阿比西尼亞與其獨立流血疆塲、不稍遲疑、爲自由而死、勝過作奴隸而生萬萬、在最後一分鐘、如不能覓得和平解决之道、則阿比西尼亞將伸手以向眞主乞恩、奮鬥至最後一人、阿王又言及意國處心積慮欲征服阿國、已四十年於茲、阿政府對於近今邊界發生之諸案、不情委曲求全、以謀和和平解决、乃意國不諒、竭力備戰、必欲一逞其野心、阿王末乃抨擊意相墨索里尼、並復申阿國抗敵之决心、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿皇昨日向國會發表訓詞、引起聽衆深刻之印象、略謂爲國家計、予雖犧牲生命亦所不恤、並激勵阿國婦女稱、應爲國家鼓勵戰士奮勇擊敵、並予以種種援助、吾人自當勇於赴敵、雖最新式之軍備、亦未能迫使吾人放棄衛護祖國之天職、阿皇於叙述事變之起因及阿國盡力要求國聯調解後宣稱、意國陰謀侵略我國已有四十年、此項陰謀自去年起、已見之於軍事行動、因而發生貢達及華爾華爾事伴、意國已在接近阿國領土之處開闢軍事根據地、我人不欲戰爭、但爲國家之尊嚴計、吾人必須拒絕爲意國之保護國、現在戰機日迫、一旦釁端開始、則吾人之良心可質天日、阿國雖餘一兵一卒、亦必維護獨立到底、阿皇旋復要求人民一致團結共赴國難、最後高呼「阿國萬歲·吾人將爲阿國自由而死·上帝佑吾、等口號、國會中之阿國貴族各邦總督及政府官吏聞之大爲威動、並報以熱烈之掌聲、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞京城　阿皇今日向國會作猛烈之演說、指摘意相墨索里尼、稱之爲鼓勵戰爭、煽動士氣、以求在歷史上造就光榮之記載、並表示願親率阿軍以决死戰、俾使意國得見阿國統統一之民族、力足捍衛其國家云、外交界對於阿皇之演說頗爲重視、蓋此係示阿皇已放棄兩國間之公斷之希望云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據倫敦阿國某大員聲稱、意阿戰爭、唯列强干涉始能挽回、但阿國今已不作此望、阿王將騎白馬親率大軍、與敵一决雌雄、阿國有信仰眞主之健兒百萬、願執戈戰死疆塲、但將以貴重之代價、犧牲其生命、婦女亦將臨陣助其男子、並激勵大軍作殊死戰、阿國人和如是、而阿軍慣居山嶺沙礫之地、且必獲天時地理之宜云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>阿國接受請求　願加入紅會公約</p>

<h3>國聯行政院　定本月杪開會　法國地位左右爲難</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯秘書處今日已電致屬於行政院之各國政府請其於本月底前出席行政院特別會議、國聯日報聲稱、此項步驟决定於二日前、通電所以遲至今日始行發出者、以中間仍有接洽也、並悉仲裁辦法若再繼續、必無所成、故行政特別會議之召集實屬必要、行政會議大約將由李維諾夫召集、於本月廿八日開會、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯行政院大約將於七月二十九日開會、考慮意阿爭案、英人各界希望意國允作充分討論、因衆信意國明的宣布意旨、可助該案之解决也、但意國當然不願在國聯行政院會議前受阿國代表之指摘、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間政界以英法意三國對於阿比西尼亞問題、不能獲得和平解决之方法、故希望國聯行政院於本月底開會時、將此問題予以充分之討論、巴黎迴聲報載稱、法國在日內瓦之地位、必將十分難處、一方旣不能失歡於意大利、他方又不能積極助意破壞自己平素竭力維護之主義、沃夫爾報則稱、意大利對于法國所提出譴責阿國主張旣不贊同、則自唯聽阿國之要求、以召開國聯行政院之會議也、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國政衙策　尊重國聯義務　艾登答議員問</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院問及是否將維持阿比西尼亞之國聯會員資格、不管部閣員艾登答稱、英政府一面力圖和平解决意阿爭案、一面充分尊重國聯會員國之權利與義務、今後仍將如是云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下院議員質問政府是否贊成將國聯盟約與凡爾賽和約分開、俾德國重返國聯、不管部大臣艾登答稱、英政府深信國聯盟約與凡爾賽和約之職合、並非阻碍德國重入國聯之唯一原因云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>霍爾呼籲　柏林態度殊爲冷淡</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相霍爾、於本月十一日在下院發表外交演說、向德國元首希特勒呼籲、請其參加集體和平組織、頃據每日電聞報外交訪員探悉、德國政府對於霍爾此項呼籲、不至有滿意之答覆、按斯德萊柴會議開會時、希特勒曾宣言準備簽訂多邊互不侵犯公約、此項互不侵犯公約可與各關係國相互訂結之互助公約、普並行不悖、茲德國已不複重提此項宣言、反之、德國政府以爲法蘇互助公約簽訂後、羅加諾公約、已失其一部分効力云、又霍爾演說中、重行申明歐洲各項問題、應同時討諭、柏林方面聞之、殊爲失望、因此關於西歐天空公約之談判、左最近時期內、恐未必有何種進步也、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國建議　夷阿爲意屬國　一如英在埃及地位</h3>

<h3>李維諾夫　訪問羅馬之謎　與意相會晤尙非其時傳將假道意國赴巴黎</h3>
<p>（羅馬）此問認蘇俄外交委員長李雜諾夫與意相墨索里尼會晤之說、尙非其時、昨日墨氏與蘇俄大使艾登晤談時、亦未提及此事、消息靈通方面認李維諾夫有假道意國前往巴黎之可能、藉此一晤意相、但不信李氏將以國聯行政院主席之資格調解意阿爭端、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>對意阿糾紛　日取靜觀態度　廣田外相向意使說明杉村外交失言受指責</h3>
<p>（東京）駐日意國大使奧里梯氏、於十九日午後三時訪廣田外相、關於意阿糾紛探詢日本政府之眞意、廣田外相乃作答如左、</p>
<p>杉村大使自去年十月赴任之際、日本政府原擬對於阿國因通商上之問題、認爲重要、故最近欲與之互換公使、然當時謠言盛行、謂日本運賣武器於阿國、又有所謂政治上之連絡或政治上之野心等等風說、但亳非事實、决於必要時發出訓令、以便闡明此意、然此次對於意阿糾紛並未發出任何訓令、日本政府尙未知意阿兩國之主張若何、故此項問題是否和平解决或形勢嚴重、其發展之狀况尙不得而知、總之意阿兩國均屬日本之友邦、是以此時政府並無任何意見可述、仍擬繼續靜觀、然兩國糾紛之解决、乃日本政府衷心所切望而不已者也云云、（十九日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於杉村駐意大使之失言問題、外務幹剖人員視爲非常重大、現正調查其眞相、但杉村大使之失言、當係未曾諒解日本政府之眞意所致、外經省有鑒於茲、决定向全部駐外使臣發出訓令、詳述日本政府對於意阿糾紛之態度、以免駐外使臣採取誤廖行動、俾衙內萬全、現已採取此項手續矣、（十九日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本美意大使杉村陽太郎、十六日會見意首相墨索里尼時、聲明日本政府對於阿比西尼亞國亳無政治的關心、日外務省因杉村大使此種言動、非但不根基於本國政府訓令之越權行爲、且其結果使他國誤解日政府之根本政策、又使意大利政府利用此言、頗爲明顯、故認爲遺憾、待杉村大使報吿到後、聲明日政府對於阿比亞尼亞之方針、卽日政府對於阿比亞尼亞問題確有關心、尤其在經濟方面、因對阿貿易年年發展、特別關該方面情形、但决無如某國所傳欲以阿比西尼亞爲保護國等政治的野心、今次意大利與阿比西尼亞之紛爭、日政府並無參加其隅中之意、不過靜觀情形如何而已、意大利、政府常恨日貨在阿比西尼亞銷路暢旺、露骨表示驅逐日貨之意見、然杉村大使會見墨索里尼首相之際、僅主張日本無意以阿比西尼亞爲保護國之點、而未曾表示日本對於經濟方面之積極意見、且關於此事未請本國政府訓令、擅自表示輕薄言動、爲意政府獲得「日政府不關心阿比西尼亞、承認意大利在阿國行動」之言質、實爲外交上之大失敗、外務省現已電詢杉村大使、爲何目的會見意首相、又意政府發表之聲明書是否正式聲明、如意政府無日方諒解發表該項聲明書、則日本可以要求撤回或更正其內容、總之本問題爲外交上最近殊堪注目之問題也、（十九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>美國所採立塲　希望依據條約和平解决不擬派員列席國聯旁聽</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）國務副總理費理浦今日在此聲稱、各國政府皆願意意阿爭諸和平解决、美政府已諭令駐外各使向其駐在國政府說明美國之態度、他日日內瓦國聯行政院討論意阿問題時、美國不欲派代表列席旁聽、蓋此爭議乃大半與歐洲諸國有關之事件也、國務總理赫爾曾於七月十日與十一日邀請駐美英意法大使至國務院、詢其對於時局之意見、並詳說美國之地位、赫爾曾照會意大使、吿以美國對北非之敵對行爲、將予以深刻關切、希勿用武力從事解决云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>盜賊精神彌漫　和平公約撕成廢紙　畢德門之憤慨語</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美參院外交委員會主席畢德門、今日向參院聲稱、和平公約之簽約國、不願向其他簽約國作勇敢之表示、致使一切和平公約悉成廢紙、實爲最不幸之事、此種盜賊精神、彌漫橫溢、不獨凡爾賽和約爲之破壞、卽我人所參與之神聖莊嚴之非戰公約以及保障弱國領土之種種公約、亦爲破壞無餘、畢民更謂美國於公理破滅之世界中、應賴其强大之陸海軍防止野心國家之侵略也、（十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>德國政敎糾紛　希特勒將嚴厲干涉任凱爾禮敎部長</h3>
<p>（柏林）元首希特勒頃任命不管部閣員凱爾爲禮敎部部長、掌管宗敎問題、按此項職務、原由德國內長敎長及普魯士內長會同處理、凱爾爲國社黨中最先加入之老黨員、爲普魯士總理戈林之好友、今春戈林結婚卽由凱爾爲之證婚、凱爾曾任普魯士司法部部長、嗣因併入德國司法部、凱爾始加入德國內閣、任不管部閣員、平時以急進着稱、此次被任禮敎部長、似可表示政府將嚴厲干涉宗敎糾紛云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）普魯士總理戈林頃通令行政機關及各警腦、若對敎會及天主敎團體之一切活動嚴加約束、並歷數敎士罪狀、謂其濫用宗敎權威干涉政治問題、且對於國社黨之統一觀點拒絕接受、戈林特規定一項原則、謂「嗣後凡屬敎士均應竭誠保護國社黨國家、絲毫不得有所保留」、此項命令頒佈後、德國與敎延間之緊張關係、當益趨嚴重云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>雅典　柴達理斯內閣頃已提出總辭職、閣潮發生原因、由於復辟派閣員陸軍部長貢第利斯·農業部長戴阿多克斯等主張宣佈復辟、其時內務部長拉里斯社會事業部長季爾哥斯不在京城、乃以內閣行動一致爲口實、要求加以說明、但柴達理斯總理不允照辦、僅請彼曾向國民大會宣言、政府對於國體問題、在舉行公民投票時期、遵守中立熊度、藉以保證公民投票之誠信舉行、因此貢第利斯與戴阿多克斯提出辭職內閣遂致瓦解、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>雅典　希臘柴達理斯內閣今日因複辟問題業巳辭職、柴總理於客詢以是否贊成復辟時答稱、渠游德國後當發表一文、渠擬今日卽赴柏林、柴氏後又宣稱、渠將依其本衷組織新政府、公共事務渠個人負責云、專任陸長孔第列斯將軍爲主張維持共和者、據吿新聞訪員、謂渠縱不加入新政府、但仍擬予以贊助云、衆料新政府將於今晚成立、聞柴氏除自任總理外將兼陸長職、據報載消息、下月將舉行公民投票、俾從速决定國民是否擁護共和、抑贊成復辟問題、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>失事原因供稱不一</p>
<p>本月十二日下午四時三分、茂利公司茂利二號輪船、在定海碼頭沈沒後、上　航政局於十三日據報、即面派員調查、幷令茂利公司速報詳情、兼辦理善後、一面呈報交通部、昨該局復召集茂利二號船主徐友生　大副張永棠·及輪機長方林才、（即老軌）大管輪陸順蘭·（即二軌）二管輪陳紀發·（即三軌）分別訊問、聚禍事之情形、據駕使部份船員供稱、機艙船員大部份係屬生手、運用機器、灰盡合宜、以致機艙進水、據機艙船員供稱、駕駛部份船員、裝貨不勻、致前後吃水、相差五尺餘、靠碼頭時、後纔太緊、後笆門離水太近、在四時三十分、正値漲潮、致後笆門（因上午客貨未關）突然進水、以致沉船、雙方供詞各執、互相推諉、眞相一時尙難明瞭、須俟該船打撈後、嚴密查勘、或可大白、</p>
<p>雇傭水鬼從事打撈</p>
<p>又據茂利公司人員稱、該輪貨物、業經僱用水鬼取起、現正從事打撈、至該輪原名Eumeralla　Lloydclassal係向澳大利亞洲購來、由外洋航行來申、海航月餘、極爲平穩、此次複經航政局及保險公司騐船師詳細檢騐、認爲合格、船身修葺均已竣工、於本月十一日下午六時開航、船身頗穩、速率亦佳、航經大戢洋面、安抵普陀、迨航至定海靠岸之後、經一時十五分之久、始肇此禍、殊出意料、或係別有原因、非關船身穩定與否也、至十九日某報及十八日某晚報所載、殊與事實不符、該項消息、似係他方面另有作用者、所傳播云、</p>

<h3>超過濬浦局預測　昨晨浦江高潮　距離江岸不足一英尺低窪馬路倒灌見積水</h3>
<p>昨晨浦江高潮、所發數量、達十二呎一吋、超過預測四吋、距離外灘江岸不足一英呎、潮水雖幸未溢岸、特別低窪馬路、則已見積水、大通社記者、探錄各情於後、</p>
<p>發潮較預測為高</p>
<p>昨晨高潮、當漲至最高點時、在二點三十五分、照濬浦局預測二時零五分之時刻、延遲三十分鐘、其數量計爲十二呎一吋、亦照預測增加四吋、是項高潮、於平明五時十三分開始下退、至向午十一時二十分、完全退落、</p>
<p>去江岸不足一呎</p>
<p>昨晨高潮、爲本年七個月以來、浦江發潮最高之一日、其時去外灘江岸僅九英吋、潮流泊泊、其不泛溢江岸、誠有間不容髪之槪、尤以如外灘公園等處、其堤岸並不足十三呎、故當時受潮水浸襲之情勢、尤爲岌岌、</p>
<p>低窪馬路見積水</p>
<p>本埠低窪馬路、如四川路·漢口路·以及外灘等處、去年以迭被潮水、從陰溝倒灌、泛成澤國、故均經工部局於本年一月間塡高、第尙有浙江路（南京路以南）永安天韻樓門前、以及甘肅路與阿拉白司脫路交又處、未經築高、故昨晨均見積水、又以時在深夜、關於其他低窪馬路、倒灌泛水者、恐尙不僅此、</p>
<p>超過預測之原因</p>
<p>昨日上午、向濬浦局水理科、叩詢發潮數量超過預測原因、始悉不外（一）長江水位本來頗高、（二）氣候不及前數日之高朗、（三）有輕微之東南風、集合上面三種原因、其力量亦極微弱、第亦不無小小關係云、又前日下午潮位、最高僅十呎零三吋二分、並無十二呎、</p>
<p>八月份潮汐預吿</p>
<p>濬浦總局昨發表本年八月份之潮汐云、一日至三日高潮爲一〇·五六呎、低潮三·〇五呎、四日至十日高潮爲九·八〇呎、低潮爲五·五六呎、十一日至十七日高潮爲十二·〇二呎、低潮爲四·一八呎、十八日至二十四日爲十一·三二呎、低潮爲五·〇五呎、二十五日至三十一日高潮爲十一·四五呎、低潮爲四·五〇、</p>
<h3>濬浦局正式開挖神灘　工作時間僅限白晝</h3>
<p>濬浦局之建設號大挖泥船、自低滬後、旋卽駛赴神灘（卽同沙白沙）試挖、茲悉現已正式開始濬挖、該船上所置試挖信號、現已撤去、改用國際通語旗號之AHF旗、意謂「本船正在挖濬工作、」其工作時間、僅限於白盡云、</p>

<h3>特載　簡易壽險與社會保險　張明昕</h3>
<p>簡易壽險為社會保險之一種、其目的同為安定人民生計、實現社會政策、所異者不外其用途與辦法有所區別、吾人在未研討簡易壽險之前、對於社會保險之原理、尤應光事作簡略的叙述、俾其系統分明、易以瞭解、</p>
<p>自產業革命以還、歐洲工業發達國家、其勞動階級者、感於疾病·災害·傷亡·衰老·之無可避免以是莫不先有相互救濟之共濟組合、然後其政府當局、爲增進國民福祉·緩和社會問題計、而有各種社會保險法現之制定、對於被保之對象、有為強制加入與任意加入之分、而承保機關、亦有由國家設局專營、或附設於勞動組合自治團體中者、則莫不視適台其國情與否、而决定所應採取之方策、迄於今茲、其組織日臻精密、近世學者、多列舉社會保險爲七檢、即疾病·負傷·產育·殘廢·衰老·死亡·失業·等、而與小額人謹保險之「簡易壽險者、或為並行不悖、或為張弛異度、然其裨益於國計民生、收效之宏、誠可謂有殊途同歸之妙、茲更將兩者之史略與意雜析述如次、</p>
<p>（一）社會保險之史略</p>
<p>社會保險創始於歐洲德國於一八八三年及一八八四年、首光制定强制疾病及傷亡保險法案、實爲社會保險之嚆矢、其主旨在謀國民福利、而緩和當時勃興的社會主義、以維持國家之安寗秩序、然此種制度之頒行、實給與其他各國以重大之影響、而繼續先後仿行、簡言之、則前乎此者、尙有一八七八年英國强制人民向政府購買年金之計刻、而後起者則一八九四年瑞士有失業保險之試辦、比利時於一九零一年在根脫Ghent市創立之勞働組合失業補助金、尤爲現代失業保險之光驅匈牙利及法國亦先後於一九零六年及一九一零年　舉辦强制生存保險、英國於一九零年創設疾病及姙娠保險、美國因各方對於事業主責任保險、多屬不滿、批難紛起、故於九一一年、乃有强制勞働傷亡保險法之制定、後他種保險亦相繼設立、日本於一九一六年創設、「簡易壽險、同時復有工塲法施行令、鑛夫勞役抉助規則、傭人扶助令等之丁立法制定、尤爲後起社會保險之大成功也、</p>
<p>（二）社會保險之意義</p>
<p>社會保險有狹義的與廣義的之分、狹義的即爲疾病，衰老保險、而廣義的則包含社會民衆所受一切災害之保險、然現代社會保險之意義、實含有左列三大主旨、</p>
<p>（一）補償人民因意外疾病、或殘廢等所受薪資之損失、</p>
<p>（二）保障死亡者家庭之經濟、</p>
<p>（三）供給衰老時之生活費、故社會保險之意義、實爲一種保障中下級人民、因意外、疾病·殘廢·衰老·失業·或死亡等、對於其自身及其家族塡補其所遭受之損害、以免險經濟生活不安爲目的之制度、然國營之保險事業、非盡為社會保險、質言之、則無論何項保險、凡不競爭營利為目的者、皆得謂之為社會保險、故除人身災害危險外、他項財產保險、（如器具及家財的火災·水災·盜難等、）其有此項要素者、亦得稱之爲社會保險、簡易壽險對於上列之三主旨、實佔其二、即（一）保障死亡者家庭之經濟、（二）供給衰老時之生活費、</p>
<p>（三）簡易壽險之史略</p>
<p>吾人遠稽往古、如希臘時代之友誼會、羅馬之殯葬組織、德國之各種共濟組合、其旨皆根據多數之捐、以救濟少數之不幸者、又如十七世紀英國亦開始有友愛組合、Friendty　Society及殯葬會社之組織、雖其辦法仍屬簡陋、然頗能適合於當時一般人民之需要、對於簡易壽險之形態、蓋僅具　而微耳、迨至十九世紀始有現代簡易壽險之創設、一八四九年英國之工衆保險公司、　Industrial　and　General　Isnrance　Co．乃開始給發工業壽險、（簡易壽險在歐美名爲工業壽險）保單、越五年改公司爲保愼保險公司Prudcntial合併、歷七十年之經營、因其賠償之　捷、頓爲社會所讚許、此項工業壽險、遂爲世界各國所注視、而美國亟起而傚之、惟美國當時供給議險於勞働者、亦多爲各種之友誼組織、然每因此種組織辦理之不善、致社友繳付之金錢、損失殆盡、故於一八七七年遂有壽險公司之組織、而發給工業壽險保單、保費係按每週計算、但無派人向保戶直接徵收之規定、此後工業壽險之新辦法、相繼產生、壽險業者亦深覺按週付費可使被保人及其家人、皆得蒙受投保壽險之利益、以是此種小額壽險、遂又爲保險界人士羣相矚目矣、</p>
<p>工業壽險之在美國、其發達雖較遲、而其經過情形、則未有不如英國者、蓋當時此項不完備之夜誼組織、因時勢推移、遂由科學方法之工業壽險制度、起而代之、一八七三年美國因經濟恐慌、多數勞働者之家庭、因家主夭亡而流於貧困、加之受英國工業壽險成績良好之反映、益使人民認識壽險保障之重要、而有「嫠婦孤兒救濟組合」Widowsand　Oriphgn＇s　Beneflt　Society之成立、在一八七七年、此項組合、改爲「美國保愼險公司」、Prudential　Insuronce　Co.　of　America一八七九年「首都壽險公司」、MetropulitumLife　Insurance　Co．及「約翰漢克」Jhon　Hancoek　Mutual　Life　Ins．Co．壽險公司、亦開始辦理工業　險、此後其他壽險公司、相繼辦理此項業務、但因規模較小、頗難發展、或未幾即行停辦、故理時「首都」「保愼」及「約翰漢克」三公司、實執全美工業壽險之牛耳、該三大公司之契約金額、約占全美總額百分之十四、其成績之超越、可謂已極、而世界各國鋻於工業壽險對於社會民衆利益之重要、亦羣起而傚法之、日本人壽保險制度、發軔於一八八一年、嗣後日趨發展、其政府當局、鋻於簡易壽險、對民衆具有深切需要、適日俄戰爭結束、工商業　形發達、以是急起直追、着着籌備、至一九一六年、由郵局開始辦理簡易壽險、其成績之良好、竟出其當局意料之外、外方開辦之初年、其預計之契約為十二萬六千件、乃第一年度結果、（實僅六個月由一九一六年十月至一九一七年四月）竟超出預算者一倍以上、一九二零午、因業務發達迅速、辦事人員增加、爲謀統轄管理上之便利起見、遂另行成立簡易保險局監督指揮之、一九二六年滴爲其創設簡易壽險之十週紀念、計有契約一千餘萬件、而保額已超過十二萬萬元、是年並創設郵政年金事業、以應人民需要、至一九三十一年因簡易壽險基礎鞏固、積存金增加、乃開始辦理較爲危險之兒童保險、雖爲時未久、而其成績亦屬良好、</p>
<p>日本自開辦簡易壽險、迄今僅有十八年之歷史、其成績之優良、舉世國營壽險事業中、無出其右者、臆年世界各國壽險專家、開會於倫敦時、日本代表報吿其成績後、全塲人士、均爲之驚訝稱贊不置、歐美各國派員赴日考察者實不乏其人、現在波蘭亟起仿行、其他各國亦紛紛籌設、截至最近止、其保額已達三十萬萬元、契約有二千二百餘萬件、每月可收入保費約一千八百餘萬元、每日平均塡發新保單七千餘張、積存命數額（一九三四年十月）已達九萬萬餘元、總計全國人民、保有簡易壽險已占百分之三十、由以上之數字觀之、巳可謂突飛孟晋、扶霄直上、然其辦理人員、並無自滿之念、尙在孜孜考究、改進能率方與未艾中、茲將美英日三國簡易壽險成績、列表如左、</p>

<p>（二）由註冊編配股歸納各委員選定之結果、將票數最多之八個單位提出、作種子法之準備、</p>
<p>（三）在此八個單位中、再擇較多票數之四單位、分別抽籖安挿於上下部四段中、而以其餘四單位用同樣方法抽排於不同之各段內、</p>
<p>（四）如有票數相等之單位、以各委員所列理想之次字中之先後作分別階段之標準、</p>
<p>（五）依上法則理想中得半複賽權者、已完全揖列妥當、不致在初次賽中相遇、於是將其餘各單位、用抽籤法安挿於全部秩序之空位中、</p>
<p>（六）網球比賽秩序單打每一單位在上下兩部中各行安挿一人、以抽籤法决定之、單打之上下兩部及雙打之分配方法、完全相同、</p>

<p>綱球塲及球</p>
<p>網球比賽、規定一律在硬地球塲舉行、所用之球、規定爲「司拉人傑」牌、</p>

<p>以前各屆大會、田徑賽每項錄取四名、田賽預賽、（跳高撐竿跳除外）成績較優之六人、則再行决賽、茲錄取數額、已改為六名、致田賽决賽人數、有詢問是否增加者、查本會規則、係採用國際體育恊會所審定者、田賽決賽人數、規則中規定爲六人、且世界運動會係國際體育協會所主辦、而世界運動會錄取之名額、亦復與本屆大會相等、故本届並不因錄取名額之增加、變更田賽决賽之人數（或謂世界運動會雖取六名、僅前三名有獎、後三名係存記性質、而全國運動會則六名均有獎有分、情形似有不同云云、要知給獎、原爲一種熒譽之表示、計分亦僅爲增加興趣之一種方式、對於競賽之實質、並無絲毫關係、故本届大會、决不因此小節而變更規則、何况世界運動會根本不採用計分之制度耶、）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （宛廬）</p>
<p>結婚是戀愛的墳墓，要是安安穩穩攢進墳墓，到也嘸哈！怕的是還有攢進墳墓以前，却生出小孩子來；要撫養，要教育，活活把你累得要死，這個罪才難受！無以名之，名之曰：「子女是戀愛的刑罰」。</p>
<p>人家總以爲處世的藝術，和朋友不妨帶着點虛情假意，至於處家庭手足，那就非十分眞切不可！其實楚錯誤的：朋友本來是不相干的人結成的，要從推心置腹，肝膽相照，才能得着眞正患難之交；如果你抱着虛情假意去交友，就沒有人肯和你共心腹了，家庭手足，本是性分中人，如果不攙進一點世故來調劑迄純粹的天眞，那末各人依着自己的性情用事，一定要釀成　牆之　，家庭之內，詬誶時聞，你看張公百忍的忍字，不就是忍住眞性情不讓它發作嗎？所以處朋友要眞，處家庭倒不妨假。</p>
<h3>旗袍的叉口問題</h3>
<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>男子們聚攏來，總以女子爲閒談的題材。某次在風雨之夕，來了幾個朋友，談到後來，不期然的又轉到女子的身上去。甲說：</p>
<p>「現在女子的旗袍的叉口，未免太短，走起路來實在不方便，而且和束胸般的有束縛女子的嫌疑。」</p>
<p>「不錯，女子現在是講解放了，所以照我的意見，現在的短叉口不久一定要重行改爲長又口」。乙附和着甲。</p>
<p>「叉口改去了，把袴子露在外面未免有些不雅，而且違反了新生活運動的條件，將來决不致改長的；况且短叉口，也實在比長叉口爲美觀。」丙提出異議。</p>
<p>「不然，如果講起美來，何以以前長叉口也曾風行過一時？當時並沒有人說是不美呢」？甲又反駁着丙。</p>
<p>「娘兒們的花樣翻得快，我們的眼光也隨着轉得快，美不美根本沒有定律，只要時髦」。丁君出來調和着他們。</p>
<p>戊君聽了多時，至此也冷冷然的提出意見來道：「叉口是决不會改長的，理由很簡單，因爲女子走起路來第一個條件要走得慢，慢則可以搖擺得顯出婀娜的美妙姿態來，叉口愈短，走路便愈慢，也愈能顯出婀娜來；女子誰不希望婀娜，怎肯改長了自失其美呢」？</p>
<p>甲君聽了說道：「你這話很幽默，我可以取銷我的主張」。</p>
<p>乙君也帶着幽默的口吻道;「女子的走路旣然只要婀娜，那末戴上了脚鐐，走起路來不更艱難？格外顯出婀娜來嗎？」</p>
<p>「高跟皮鞋不就是脚鐐嗎」？我也凑着趣說。</p>
<h3>乞丐成功史</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>我住的弄口過街樓下，在十年前，每晚有一個小癟二，蜷宿着過夜。這個小癟二，那時還只近二十歲。起初是沒人注意着。過了半年，才留給了人一個印象，而且知道他叫做阿六。</p>
<p>他日常的工作，是在蘇州河上的各橋上，拉黃包車，求人給與一個子兒的佈施。每天拉得的錢，除了把一部分交給爺叔（這一行的丐頭）之外，餘下的，都攢聚起來。好在他的飯食，是倒着包飯作飯桶裏的殘飯的，所以二年之中，倒居然也積了些兒小資本。</p>
<p>在八年之前，他不當小癟三了，把積聚的幾塊錢作資本，販了一些糖果玩具，到各小學門口去販賣。三年之中，倒着實賺了些錢，於是改設了一個攤頭，賣着糖果，玩具，文具等等。忽忽地又是三年，那已是前年了，他忽然租了一間門面，開起烟兌，油酒，文具，糖果等式式都有的小雜貨舖子起來了。因爲他的信用好，所以各店舖裏，都肯把貨賒給他。同時，因爲他待人接物，十分和氣，所以大家都樂於和他交易。</p>
<p>到了去年夏天，他結着店裏除了吃用開銷之外，倒着實多了些錢，於是索性把那幢房屋，項了下來，而當起二房東來了。而且在去年年底，和一個新寡的文君，結合同居了。</p>
<p>我們瞧着他爬起來的，都沒一個不對着他贊歎。而同時呢，他也並不諱言以往之事。閒着沒事時，他還是津津樂道他的奮鬥的過程。</p>

<p>介夫却楚不必他引路，先走着進他的房子。一面說道：做新娘子的人，總是有些害臊的。不過他聽到我快有差事了，向了我微笑，倒有向我恭喜的意思。志前因他已楚走進屋子來了，這就讓他坐下，而且斟了一杯茶，又遞烟捲過去。他這才揭下帽子，脫下馬褂，都放在旁邊茶几上，笑道：見上司雖是一件樂事，也是一件苦事。不見他，那裏有差事到手？可楚眞去見他，那一分拘束，也就不是言語可以形容的。哎！作官難囉。說着，表示十分歎息的樣子。一低頭，看到桌上放了一根烟捲，笑道：現在衙門裏的風紀很對。都講新生活，並不預備烟捲待客，就是一杯淸茶而已。我認爲這是對的，一年要省下好些個錢。譬如我今天去見高廳長，是爲了求他給差事，怎麼樣子放肆，也不能當了他的面抽烟，何必預備呢？今天我到建設財政兩廳，都沒有烟捲，財政廳而且不要茶，用白開水敬客，這更顯着講求衛生。他口裏說着，就不知不覺的啣着那枝烟捲，點上拍起來了。志前，在他對面斜坐着，望了他道：假使張先生將來做了廳長，抽烟不抽呢？他說着這句話、却帶了一分笑容，把眼光射到介夫身上去？（二七〇）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊聽了，立刻就大怒起來，便打發一個太監出去把七位女官一起喚進了宮來，厲聲向伊們說道：</p>
<p>「豈有此理！誰敢跟德齡胡鬧？伊勸我不要到長廊下去散步，自是伊的好意，我怎會不知道？爲什麽倒要你們把伊議論起來！以後無論誰都不准如此！有那一個再敢提起殺頭兩個字的話，給我查明白了，少不得就將伊送去殺頭！大家都牢記着，再犯了楚不能饒恕的！……現在給我出去吧！」</p>
<p>那七個人便一起戰戰兢兢的退出去了，可是我還不敢十分安心，便又問道：</p>
<p>「那末奴才眞可不必殺頭了嗎？老佛爺。」</p>
<p>「什麽話？當然是沒有的事！」太后大笑道：「你現在可以不必再擔心了！天賦人以各種知識，我們自然應該讓他們盡量的運用，祗要適當便行！可是依着皇家的習慣，和通例而論，你方才的行爲，確然也可算得是一椿抗旨的罪案；如果當眞要處刑，那末你的頭也許眞的可以砍下來了！」</p>
<p>第三十章　仁愛與公正</p>
<p>這一日的淸晨，太后照例又在某一座大殿上集合了伊的羣臣，舉行着早朝的儀式；羣臣參拜過之後，那掌理軍機重任的慶親十便首先越班奏道：</p>
<p>「關於查辦廣東撫臺臣某的一案，昨天奴才那兒已有很詳盡的奏報接到了！廣東全省百姓所上的公稟裏頭，控他的十四欵，經查明是完全眞實的；太后前此差出去查辦此案的各人，都有奏報來證明的他的罪狀。奴才不敢隱瞞，理應將本案全卷送呈御覽，恭候聖意裁奪……。」（三七〇）</p>
<h3>「僻姓」趣話</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>昨　夜，足跡踏遍了兩廣的旅行家田曙嵐君來訪我，他所談的廣西人的僻姓，倒是很有趣的。</p>
<p>「有一天，」他說，「我翻閱一本地方誌一類的書籍，看到裏面有關於廣西「大姓」，「著姓」，「僻姓」的記載，前兩項沒有什麽惹人注意的地方；倒是那後一項，卻有兩個怪僻得有起的姓。那就是有人把豬　的「豬」字做他的姓。………」</p>
<p>「那自然有趣，不過一想到許多人姓牛，姓馬，那就似乎不足爲奇了。」我說。</p>
<p>「最奇怪的楚有人姓着「屎」字。　屎，你看，這齷齪的字眼！」</p>
<p>「這就太妙了！」</p>
<p>「我在那裏又碰着一位姓「乃」的廣西人。我在我的「廣西旅行記裏說起了這伴事：前天，承印我這本書的書局把校樣送來了，校閱先生在「乃」字旁邊加了一隻耳朶「？」表示世界上有沒有姓「及」的人，有此懷欵。我把？改成了。（句號）用不着懷疑，我在廣西確實碰着了「乃」君。」</p>
<p>「這些都是「百家姓」上所沒有的。」</p>
<p>「沒有，沒有！」</p>
<p>「所以，如果專門拿書本來對照世事，常常不免陷於「書生之見」。」我說。</p>

<h3>母親與梅醬</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>前幾天正是熱梅天氣，黃熟梅子上市，一位親戚忽然送來一罐杜製　梅醬，我又感謝又快活！這東西是用熟梅，玫瑰花瓣，和糖醫等煮製，甜勝於酸，味極雋美的，我已多年沒有嘗到了。我又因　觸想起了當我八歲八—那年我母去世十以前的一些小事。</p>
<p>母親愛我們是是微不至的，我永遠記得！母親會做很好的梅醬，每當熱梅上市，伊總故了很多的梅醬，贈送親隣以外。自己家裏總留有多瓶，大份爲供給我小姊弟們閒吃的。我們每犬旁晚從家塾散歸內室，每人奉母親面前把這天的新功課背上一遍，背得出　有得吃梅醬，由伊派到我們的嘴邊：這是母親定下的「年常舊規」。我小時節尚算不笨，三天三四十行論語孟子的新課程，念上三五遍便熟了，所以這例內的梅醬是穩可到口的。</p>
<p>可是，我也同別個孩子一樣是不知足的；梅醬的風味着實配我愛甜和酸的胃口，我每天但吃這一回總覺不夠，便使用我的小小詭計，常在驀地一裏嚷起肚子餓來。這是何等重大的事，天下做母親的聽到伊們自己的孩子的連連嚷餓聲，全都認識這會影響到孩子的健康何等　害，必圖立刻補救而無所用其躊躇！於是我的母親也不例外，總要殷勤垂詢。我就乘機請求：「吃一些梅醬罷，並不是十分的飢餓。」這樣，我常得達到多吃一些梅醬的目的。</p>
<p>可是，小孩子的過分貪吃，終會繪大人識破機關的。有時我在飽食後不久又使出我的慣計來在我母親面前嚷餓，却被伊察出這是斷不會餓的時候；伊就要問我了：「那裏會餓？餓怎麼來呀？」我實逼處此，會得老實不客氣的回答：「我餓梅醬……」不是可嘆的傻話麽？這等無理取鬧的言語，在社會上說出來是可擔保的給人不受理，甚至賺到譏嘲的反響的；但我那時在無所不容的母親的會　的微笑之下，還常有得喜出望外的吃到一些梅醫咧！</p>
<p>不楚麽？母親的偉大的慈愛，在我的生命駛上雖比他人接受得短暫，我董子那能忘掉，最是逢到這熟梅天氣！</p>

<h3>新式金屬眞空管之檢討</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>關於美國新式金屬眞空管之內容及其構造，本刊前數期已有極詳細的紀載。此類金屬管的優點，固然很多，但是從另外一方面看來，牠的缺點，也未始沒有。本文所欲檢討的，便是牠的缺點的所在。</p>
<p>在沒有談到正文以前，有不能不提先聲明的，便是：以下所說的各項，都是出於反對者的口中的——原來自從金屬管發現後，在不久的將來，各處製造玻璃眞空管的廠家，將不免大受打擊。他們爲維護本身的利益計，起而反抗者，爲數頗多。卽以飛歌（Pbilco）家而言，便曾以四千五百元美金的代價，在紐約泰晤士（New　York　Times）報上登載全幅廣告，攻擊奇異廠的金屬眞空管。其犧牲之偉大，競爭之劇烈，於此可見一斑。本文所叙述的，便以此爲藍本，雖然反對者的論調，多少不免總有些牽强褊狹之處，不克引起學者的研究。但是有幾點却也不無相當理由，値得我們注意的。特詳爲逐條譯出，以供同志參考。</p>
<p>（一）新式金屬管，雖以玲瓏嬌小見稱，但是以等量的熱度，散在面積較小傳熟極易的金屬管上。其溫度比之面積較大的玻璃眞空管爲高，事屬當然。溫度旣高，不但金屬管的壽命，將因之縮短，並且還能影響到附近綫圈，電容器以及電阻等零件的數値。結果，綫路內最重要的生命綫——平衡，（Balance）將爲之喪失，雖可將綫圈等零伴遠離金屬管以補救之，但是事實上佔據的地位，不僅沒有减少，並且反而加多。</p>
<p>（二）因爲製造上的關係現在還祇能出產簡單式的金屬管，至於目下市上使用普遍而又十分需要的複作用眞空管，一時尙不能取而代之。</p>
<p>（三）因此，在同樣的應用上，金屬管的數目，必須要比較玻璃眞空管更多纔行。這樣，牠所佔據的地位，將更見兵擴大。</p>
<p>（四）眞空管的數目，旣見增加，不僅消耗的電力，將隨之加大，就是收音機的價，自然也要比較昻貴；可是效率却並不加多，這是很不合乎經濟的原則的。</p>
<p>（五）玻璃眞空管質地透明，內部如有損壞，極易一望而知。這對於使用者和修理者，是有很大的帮助的。可是金屬管却不能這樣這也是一個很大的缺點。</p>
<p>（六）金屬管之封口方法，尙多困難，且封口處又較玻璃眞空管爲多，因此，在金屬管內漏氣的問題，便極易發生。如稍有漏氣，眞空管卽完全無用。</p>
<p>金屬管雖有上述的各種缺點，可是這些都是不成問題的問題，所謂欲加之罪，何忠無辭，預料在不久的將來，自能逐一解决。那時，反對者自會銷聲匿跡，而同趨一途。據一般人的意見，在五年之內，舊式玻璃眞空管將逐漸淘汰，而在一年之內，飛歌亦將採用新式金屬管云。</p>
<h3>週率調幅——矮姆斯德郎氏的新供獻</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>矮姆斯德郎氏（Major　Edwin　H．Armstrong）是無綫電界的怪傑。現在最有効的兩種收音方式，回授式和無極外差式，就是矮氏的精心發明品。最近矮氏又完成一種新的超短波通訊方式，卽本文所講的「週率調幅」（FrequenencyModu’ation）。</p>
<p>現在通行的無綫電話播送方法，是將載播的週率固定，而將其波幅依照言語或音樂的週率而更變。但矮氏的新方法，完全和此相反；載波的波幅始終不變，而其週率則用言語或音樂的週率（卽成音週率）爲之變調。接收這種「週率調幅」的電訊，須用一種對於波幅更變的電訊（卽平常的無綫電播音）不敏銳的收音機，因此可以减少或完全免除人爲騷擾的影響</p>
<h3>雙屏三極管之來復式收音機</h3>
<p>— 德燦</p>
<p>這機採用雙屏三極管完成來復式的工作，牠的三極部份作高低週率放大，二極部份作半波整流。。雙屏三極管有85，55，607等各號。</p>
<p>高週率訊號自天綫經C4輸入L2及C1，誘導至L1通C5而至三極部份之柵極，經放大後由屏極至L3及AFC：其時一部份高週率電流經Ｃ6入地，另一部則輸至Ｃ3而達柵回路，乃生再生力：同時L4因L3之感應乃焉生誘導電壓，調節C2與L4相配諧，再輸入T．之初級，入二極部檢波，這時Ｔ.之次級由初級誘導所得之低週率電流通過RFC至三極部之柵極，使之放大，然後由屏極通L3，C8至聽筒放音。這是全機工作的大慨。</p>
<p>裝製時眞空管任選前述之一，祇須電壓相符卽可。C1及C2可用同軸電容器。L2L4各用一吋直徑管，L2一百五十圈，L1繞於L2外二十圈，用三十二號綫：L4和L2同，L3用三十六號綫繞於L4外五十圈，各綫圈最佳互相隔離，否則置成直角。其他另件註於圖中，至於本機的成績因有二重波長調節，更用二極管作檢波，兼用再生力，故選擇性靈敏度較普通三管及礦石之來復式機爲佳，算量亦增不少。</p>
<h3>業餘隨筆（二續）</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>—關於交流音—</p>
<p>交流音是收音機最易犯的通病，其發生的原因甚多，譬如眞空管用舊，濾波器及傍路電容器失效，斷路或容量不足：阻流圈亨利數不足或發生短路等等，而電源變壓器燈絲中心分綫不正也足以致之，此種現象也極普遍，將它拆下重繞雖是十全的辦法，無奈手續過繁（因變壓器常用臘固封，且導綫又粗，繞製不易，）今介紹一法極有效，將一枚〇〇二至〇〇五兆分法的固定電容器，跨接于燈絲中心分綫與燈絲一端，卽可將可厭的交流幸免除，當然續接那一面則須由試騐而得，隊圖三A，卽示新加電容器之接法，有時電源次級高壓中心分綫不正，也可應用此法，</p>
<p>此外高週率振盪電流傳入整流部分也是引起交流聲的一個原因，試將普通一隻自製的交流三四管機，調節再生力至收音最靈敏的臨界點，（卽要振盪而未振盪之一點）魷可發現營營的交流聲也同時並作，這對於收聽微弱的遠地電浪是極端有碍的可在整流管屏極串以高阻圈或加裝固定電容器，郎可使之减免，如圖三B中的L及C，它們的數値容量，前者約十個千分亨利，後者爲〇〇二至〇〇五兆分法·</p>
<p>應用汞氣整流管作整流時，如發現是項弊病，也可採用上述裝置，效果頗佳·　（完）</p>
<h3>英國的小型眞空管</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>圖中是英國The　High　Vacuum　Valve　Co．Ltd，製造的一套小型眞空管中的一枚。其外形及大小，不難於圖中窺見一斑</p>
<p>這套小型眞空管己有三種出品，爲放大係數十六的三極管，放大係數三六〇的四極簾柵管，及放大係數十二的三極管；其燈絲一律爲二弗打，〇·〇六安培。</p>
<p>這眞空管計劃時，並不專爲接收短波電訊而設計，但據說在短波長時効力亦很好。</p>

<h3>論介紹之重要</h3>
<p>— 李麥麥</p>
<p>目前有少數的著作家很有重視「創造」而輕視「介紹」的傾向。</p>
<p>自然，這種傾向之發生，並不是根據中國社會有了甚麼新的發展，發展到足够鄙棄介紹，乃是由於少數的著作家不了解創造與介紹之關係罷了。</p>
<p>照那般輕視介紹的著作家說，介紹在從前是有意義的在現在，便是保守的了，並且是走向下降的表示。我是非常驚奇這種議論的。</p>
<p>怎麼樣？我們現在就不需要介紹了麼？我們在科學上，哲學上，藝術上，文學上，美學上巳取盡近五世紀以來西洋文化之無盡實藏和結晶了麼？分開來說，十五世紀至現在的自然科學之總收穫，十六七八九的世紀的歐洲哲學之寶藏，十七八九世紀的歐洲的文學傳統，十八九世紀的社會科學之發展，對於我們都是「保守」的麼？</p>
<p>這樣對西洋文化介紹加以輕視是完全不正確的。</p>
<p>認介紹爲「保守」爲「走向下降」，那是對於文化後進國在文化上模倣先進國這一事實沒有弄清楚的綠故。一般的說來，文化發達的民族常是給那些隨在他後面的文化發達的民族指出他們自己未來的肖像。因此，文化不發達的民族對於文化先進民族之介紹與模倣，常是指明前者的歷史發展要達到後者已達到的階段而言，决不是「保守」和「走向下降」而言。法蘭西模倣過英吉利，德意志又莫放過法蘭西，我國和日本莫放過歐州各國的文化生活，難重這些都『走向下降之路』麼？</p>
<p>我們要知道，在文化的介紹和模倣上，凡是多少能够成爲一種風氣的運動，决不是根據介紹和模倣自身，乃是根據介紹和模倣民族自身之社會需要。一個民族可以向異國或自己歷史之早代學得若干東西，但這種學習是以自己需要爲基礎的。</p>
<p>譬如，戊戍前後，中國人接受達爾文的物競天選思想，僅是爲適應當時中國民族求奮發的要求的；五四時代接受自然主義，又是爲適應時反封建的要求的；而一九二七年至現在的社會科學介紹，又是象徵中國經過了法國大革命而社會關係傳入了十九世紀的。這樣看來，介紹不僅是根據新社會需要，而且在文化運動上，它盡了極大的推動作用。誰能說介紹是『保守』的呢？</p>
<p>我們現在權且放棄介紹的重要性不談，而來談創造吧。究竟甚麼創造呢？創造是不是無中生有呢？不是。宇宙最高原則，是無之中不能生有，有亦不能有所滅。然則甚麼是創造？創造不過把許多年來人類腦子內貯蓄下來的材料加以煆煉加以綜合而已。合這就是說，創造是以傳統之獲得爲前提的。沒有傳統之獲得，便談不上創造。然而我們如何才能獲得近五世紀的歐洲文化的傳統呢？那就舍介紹而外無他道。所以反對介紹實不免連創造一起反對了。</p>
<p>我們只能這樣來了解介紹與創造之間的區別。就是當一個人自己身邊巳經有一種完美工具存在着，那就不必再費神創造甚麼新工具。僅在此工具不够用或不適應時，他才有創造新工具的必要。</p>
<p>當日俄兩民挨走上資本主義發展時，這兩個民族都未出現過特殊的偉大的哲人，這原因即在這兩個民族出來作思想革命時，他們身邊已經有取之不盡用之不絕的哲學體系和方法在那裏存放着。已有現存的工具不去應用，而來侈談甚麼創造，這只有傻子才做這種不經濟的事。</p>
<p>擈列哈諾夫雖然不是一個創造者，但他仍不失爲偉人。反之，像著革命哲學的著者朱謙之之流的創作，那又是甚麼東西呢？所以，我還是勸那般侈談創造的朋友在目前還是多努力介紹。</p>
<p>我有這樣一個意見：做一個有選擇能力的介紹家比做一個庸俗的作家要高出萬倍！</p>
<p>最後我認爲：必須在最近十數年內能完全佔有西洋近五世紀以來各種文化之寶藏和結晶！</p>
<h3>評「中國的銀行」</h3>
<p>— 張素民</p>
<p>吳承禧著</p>
<p>國立中央研究院社會科學研究所叢刋第一種</p>
<p>商務印書館發行　定價九角</p>
<p>這部小書，頗具興趣。因爲牠不是一部普通描寫叙述的書，但也不是頭等研究的作品。惟其如此，牠是介乎這兩種之間的一部書；作者發表意見的地方很多，所以看來，頗感興趣。</p>
<p>中國現在沒有一本專鬥描寫中國的銀行的好書。馬寅初先生的「中華銀行論」過舊了，已不適用。楊蔭薄先生的「中國金融論」上有一部分關於銀行的材料，然嫌不够。楊先生是長於描寫叙述中國各種經濟事業的第一位作家，我希望他將來出版一部「中國銀行論」在我為希望沒有實現之前，見了吳承禧先生的「中國的銀行」這部書，買來讀了之後，雖覺其不甚適用，然仍以爲值得一讀。</p>
<p>書中的內容，包括銀行史的演進與現狀，銀行業務的分析，外籍銀行內國錢莊與內國銀行，制度的檢討，和結論等。「序言」上說：「本書的目的，是從中國經濟發展之特殊的性質上，以國民經濟的觀點分析銀行，現解銀行」。我說這書頗有興趣，理由即在此。因爲這書是有立塲的。不過這個立塲—從國民經濟的觀點去分析銀行——用不着多的材料去證明，幾句話就可以說得很明白。</p>
<p>「序言」上又說：「對於銀行內部的紙織，對於各種實務或是技術的問題，以作者興趣並不在此，所以就未曾深入的加以研究，因而在本書中也就很少提及」。我在上面說過：中國現在沒有一本專門描寫中國的銀行的好書，即指沒有一部書，「對於銀行內部的組織，對於各種實務或是技術的問題」，加以正確的叙述。作者輕輕以「興趣不在此」了之，究竟還是興趣問題呢？還是難易問題呢？</p>
<p>作者，旣不注重銀行的實務與技術，也不談到今後的改革。他的理由是：「中國銀行業的前途，作者以爲要在整個的國民經濟有了辦法之後，才能談到眞正的出路。所以在這國民經濟危機四伏的今日的中國，局部的改革問題，最好是不必過於重視，以免托費精力，難以實施。……」這幾句話可以代表今日談中國經濟問題的人的一部分人的態度。我以爲錯誤。銀行業的改革，今日旣談不到，則其他各事的改革，也同樣談不到。那麼，中國一切經濟事業的改革，都要等到「整個的國民經濟有了辦法之後」再說。不知各業旣無辦法，「整個的國民經濟」，如何會有辦法呢？怎麼樣才可算是「整個國民經濟有了辦法」？局部的問題旣不重視，作者對於全部的問題，有解决的辦法沒有呢？作者寫這個局部問題的書，豈不是「枉費精力』嗎？依作者的態度，他應該寫一部名實相符的整個的國民經濟的改造」，而不必談中國的銀行！所謂「以國民經濟的觀點去分析銀行」，結果是無辦法！今日報章雜誌的經濟論文大都如此，作者或許中了這個流毒向不自知。</p>
<p>我們若從Presentation講，這書空話太多，應大事刪削·例如「業務分析上」的頭三段，是講材料的來源，應刪節放在註解中，不應放在正文上。其他地方的空話，幾舉不申舉。</p>
<p>我們再從研究的方法講，此書的材料來源，都是Secondary　sources；然在中國，即能根據此種來源，也就算是佳作了。不過「國立中央研究院社會科學研究所的叢刊」，似應較此高一等，凡是眞正研究的作品，應有解决方法（Solutions）；此書雖有「結論」，然只是Summary,不是Conclusions　or　solutions。所以作者若專門描寫中國的銀行，倒可不要解决方法。昨者原意在捨難就易，實則舍易就難。</p>
<p>我批評的調，或者打得過高，然這是因爲書上有「中央研究院」幾個字。若離開這點言，則吒書對於全不懂中國銀行業的人，足給以相當的常識。所以我說仍値得一讀。</p>
<h3>從著書到出書</h3>
<p>— 器重</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>走進書舖裏買幾本書，回家展誦之後，能够感到「十分滿意」的不大有，大都不是內容不充實，便是印刷不精良，或是裝訂不講究，將書在桌上一丢，脫口而罵書商只知道賺錢，不肯在文化方面努力：這很普通的事情，讀者中如是者想必不乏其人吧！</p>
<p>書商愛賺錢，這是無可諱言的；因爲他不賺錢，呌他那裏來吃飯呢？所以書商而能七分賺錢而三分提倡文化，已經是有良心的書商了。他旣目的在賺錢，則一書之出，求其成書之速，存本之微，這是當然的。這樣，要求其一本書而完全無疵，自然不可能。讀者其亦知一書成功之麻煩乎？一之能到讀者手中，中間已不知耗去了多少人的腦漿和心血，我現在敬將一書成功之經過，略略叙述於後：</p>
<p>著書</p>
<p>寫稿是成書的第一步工作，而且也是比較最難的工作。因爲著書的人，必須要有充分的才學，精密的頭腦，誠懇的態度，然後能够寫成好稿子。所以一個學者寫成功一部著作，常常是窮年累月，弄得目近身襄，甚至爬進了棺材而還沒有把他的著作寫成，這是很普通的事。（滑頭著作家在一兩個月甚至數天內寫成一部著作者，那常作別論。）</p>
<p>著書的工作旣這麼的不容易，然而書著成之後，未必就能到讀者的眼睛裏，因爲還須經過一個出版的手被。如果著書的人自己有錢出版印行，那當然行世要比較容易；然而，你自己有錢印書而自己並不開着書店，那發售還成了問題；因爲你請書店代售，書店每因他自己也有和你類似的著作，恐怕代售你的書搶去了他的生意，所以每每要與你拒絕的。或者，就是爲你代售，把你的書堆之高閣，讀者根本不知道有你這樣的著作，自然一本也賣不掉，使你對於著書起了極度的灰心。</p>
<p>大概著作家大都是窮人，有了著作，就去請書店出版可是，書商接到你的稿子後，他就要放出商人的眼光來，審察你的著作是否可以帮他賺錢。要是不能帮他賺錢的話，那雖是你窮了畢生之力寫成的著作，他也要加以拒絕的；反過來，假使稿子能够給他賺錢，那即使費幾個黃昏東剪西抄而成的著作，他還是很歡迎的。所以，著作家縱有了名貴的作品，未必就能出版。</p>
<p>現在，我們且不去談這種問題，我們假定著作家所著作，已經由書商接收而預備出版了。</p>
<p>設計</p>
<p>出版界接收了著作人的一份稿件，當然，他就預備排印出版。可是，他在排印之先，就得先行來一個設計，規定這本書印成多少大小，每頁排幾行，每行排幾字，用幾號字排印，如何排法，將來如何裝訂。一切都預先設計好了，排幾號字也一一批明了，然後再送到印刷局去排印。假使你的設計不週到，將來排印校對的時候就有很多的麻煩；假使你的設計不妥當，將來出書後，可以使讀者對於這本書失掉了不少的信仰。所以，出版界接到了著作，設計出版，也是一樁極困難的問題。</p>
<p>發排</p>
<p>一本稿子設計好了，就可以發到印刷局去排印了。假使書商自己有印刷局的，這問題當然不困難；可是資本不大的書商，自己不能設立印刷所，那便有問題了。他躊躇着給那家印刷局排呢？規模不大的印刷局，不僅材料不完備，而且機器不　　，工人的技術不高明，决不能印出一本精美的書籍來；規模大的印刷局，大半又是別家書店所自設，他們印行自己的書，無暇來接受你的生意；就是接受了，把你的稿子一直擱置着，擱置了一年半年，他算不了一回事，這你拿他怎麼辦呢？讀幹，你讀到這裏，你一定要挿口說一句『那找個規模不大不小的印刷局就得啦』！啊，可是談何容易！不大不小的印刷局，往往也因材料不充足，排出來的成績不會好，而且每因缺了一個字或是一個符號，一時買不來，可以延擱好幾天。再有，他們排印零碎的雜件比較容易賺錢，排整本的書不容易賺錢，他們所以接你的生意，不過預備生意清淡時來弄弄的，他們來了零碎的生意，就得把你的生意擱置起來，你急也沒有用的。</p>
<p>現在，我們假定書商找到了家很好的印刷局，他把稿子送了去，實行排版了。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>取締居民戶外納凉有感</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>幾日來，本市天氣，跟着寒暑表水銀的升起，一天熱似一天。一般居民，無不在高度的熱浪下，叫苦連天。然白天必須去工作，一入晚間，大家就在戶外納凉。且多有終宵在弄堂口或馬路旁露宿者。這不國是取一時的爽適而已。</p>
<p>隔昨，本市公安局，忽有取締居民戶外納涼之舉。據云：際此炎夏，每當夕陽西下之時，馬路及行人道上，裸臥納涼，觸目皆是，不特妨害交通衛生，且與新運不符，故特令崗警隨時予以　阻，如有違者，即以違警例處罰。同日我們又看到首都警察廳一則同樣的佈告，亦是取謗居民在戶外乘諒的。</p>
<p>按公安局禁止居民戶外納涼，是因爲有妨害交通衛生，且與新運不符，理由實很充足而正當，居民聚集路旁乘涼，車輛往來，自屬不便。而羣衆雜沓，空氣渾濁，又易傳染疾病。若裸體坐臥，形態也是難看。電種不良習慣，自有取締的必要。</p>
<p>然居民夜間在戶外納凉，爲的是納凉，當這炎威迫人天氣，誰不感到汗流浹背之苦？除少數住高樓廣厦的，家裏裝石電扇，自覺風涼有餘。一班窮朋友，那就非常要命。一間狹隘如鴿籠的亭子間或擱樓中，　集多人，在一百度的熱度下，會把人的皮晒肉成焦黑。而上海這個地方，逛公園是要買門票的，不是人人可以隨便進去。游泳池更是公子小姐的消夏去處。影戲院雖有冷氣間的設備，也只有讓有錢人去享受。在這種環境中生存着的大部分上海居民，晚間唯一却熱的所在，弄堂口及馬路旁而外，還有什麼地方？</p>
<p>戶外納凉，有干警例，但想到一般居民給驅進亭子間或櫊樓後，坐受炎熱襲擊的苦痛及不衛生，則衛生當局亦必惻然憫之，當更思有以善其後也。</p>
<h3>高踏峇魯小景</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>高踏峇魯的氣候，時時都隨着季風而變更。像現在，正是西南季風的時節，因此，天氣異常的酷熱。白天裏，太陽像一團燄燄的火盆，恨恨地吐射出辣炎的光芒，把路旁的嫩綠的小草晒炙得奄奄地低垂着。人像醉酒似的，昏昏迷迷；又彷彿患了失眠症，老是打着瞌睡，一躺下床，便泥也似呼呼地睡去了。</p>
<p>可是，當太陽枕在西邊的叢林的梢頭，以至於無力地沉下去的時候，黃昏的暗淡的顏色漸漸地從宇宙的。四周伸展出來；輕微的晚風，新淸的，凉爽的，陣陣的飄拂着，這時的氣候，好像由「炎夏」而轉入「秋凉」的狀態了。在這「夕陽無限好」的黃昏，高踏峇魯的風光，情調，是給人們一個多麼美麗的快感，而深刻的記憶，眷戀的呵！</p>
<p>每當夕陽西下，吃過晚飯之後，跟着拖鞋，悠閒地到街上去散步，輕淸的晚風飄送來一種斷斷續續嗡嗡然的聲音，彷彿蒼蠅的低吟似的，徘徊在耳朵裏，這便是土人的虔誠的祈禱的聲音。—「這與世無爭的民族，要神給他們的什麽指示呢」？心底裏這麼的饗着，同時也覺得有點好笑起來。</p>
<p>高踏峇魯的土人的生活，是最使人們感到不舒服和難過：低矮的屋子，約莫有六七尺高，是用些粗糙的木頭，竹鋪蓋著亞答葉，屋的前後面都安放著短短的階梯，在階梯上向房門口裏面望去，就可以淸楚地瞧見裏面的一切簡陋而又骯髒的陳設。而且，大多數是這麽的一問房子，却住着一家幾個人，——自然，他午的睡覺，吃飯，拉矢……都在這個地方了。</p>
<p>高踏峇魯的土人，那恐怕是世界上最懶惰的民族吧。他們有時整天的聚着幾個同伴無所事事的閒扯着，有時却蛇也似的躺在地板上睏覺，等到肚子覺得有點餓了的時候，才懶散散地站起來，跑到門口，買一兩包用芭蕉葉裏住的馬來飯，剝去了外面的芭蕉葉，用手指抓進口裏去，或走到咖啡店裏吃一些麵包或咖飯就算數了。至於衛生，在他們，那簡直不知道這是什麽一回事，因此，他們的住屋的週遭的許多土窟窿裏，時時滿積着汚水和垃圾物。白天裏，給炎熱的陽光嗮晒蒸得散佈着一股令人作嘔的難堪的臭氣。一到晚夜，蚊子多得怕人，倘使你提着煤油燈在屋子裏蹬了片刻，馬上便有許多蚊子飛集起來，彷彿下總攻擊令，把你圍籠得逃避不得了。然而，話又得說回來，自然也有一些講究衛生的土人，但這畢竟是少數人的，——一些政府機關裏的人物。</p>
<p>高踏峇魯的女子，據就在馬來半島中要算是最漂亮的。她們看著圓大，秀麗，晶溜，熱情的眼珠子，豐潤的臉龐，裝飾着嫵媚的輕笑，健康的色澤，和婀娜苗條的身材。這些少女却喜歡穿着着花花綠綠的顏色的沒有鈕扣的外衣，頭上蒙着一條綢質的頭巾，下身圍着「紗籠」，脚下跟着繡花的拖鞋，四肢，頸上，耳朵都掛着笨重的裝飾品，有時也擦着濃厚的脂粉，走起路來是多麼的婀娜動人的。然而，這些少女平常在高踏峇魯的街道上是不大瞧得見的，除了在影戲院和其他的娛樂塲所之外，他們也整天地守在家裏，像咱們封建時代的女子一樣。</p>
<h3>父親</h3>
<p>— 摩加</p>
<p>好像是一種下意識作用，看到跟自己差不多同等年紀的小伴子，都有着一個可以無厭地伸手去要錢來享樂的父親。我便不禁默默地，也許是悲痛地想起自己的父親的一份財產是怎樣的毀了，這一毀，同時也就把我美麗的憧憬和樂園的環境一起子弄碎滅，我因此，感到無端的憤怒，我憎恨一切，可是任是憤怒，憎恨，都徒然，我已經實實在在跌倒在命運殘酷的巨掌的蹂躪中。而當一度展讀到充滿着事業失敗後一個老年者寂寞的心語，充滿對於世感喟而又含着十足的厭倦的太息的父親的來書的時候，我卽有一度沉在鬱悴的悲思的時候，於是父親那淸亮的而如今却逐漸遲滯下來的聲音，那一根根的發白的頭髮，那枯瘦的面龐，和遭暴風雨的襲擊，頓然荒凉的家一同地，彷彿一幅塗着闇淡的顏色的影圖浮廻於腦子上，我的心開始在顫頭地發抖，眼睛在漸漸的糢糊，尤其是唸到：半生辛苦，一旦悉付東流，一家老幼，嗷嗷待哺，而父手中復少積蓄，長此以往，實有斷炊之虞…這些字句，每　字眼兒簡直成為一把刀子似的挿進我的胸膛，直落上背窩根，我幾乎沒有勇氣把信繼續讀下去。無形的淚水在眼眶里逡巡，我的視綫也一陣陣暗下來，整個的思想與威情一下子沉重到快要凝結一樣。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>而慘痛的回憶却無情地向我猛湧！</p>
<p>記着那年秋間，父親兩家店舖子在一種橫禍的災難下突然給封閉的不幸的消息傳來的時候，我彷彿叫誰打腦袋擊了一棒，我昏了，帶着顆不知如何是好的失神的心忽怱回去，雖只相別不上一年，而一瞧父親的面容竟有如隔了悠久的時日那麽異樣地蒼老，為了店子的事件，奔走四個月才告了結。但全部的資財是蕩然了。父親面頰上的顴骨越突起來，眼睛深陷下去，並且負了兩肩未完的債務回來。便這樣倒下來了。我暗自嘆息着。</p>
<p>「命運里注定的，命運里注定的。唯有樂觀吧了。琪兒，人生的事業終是要從艱難中建造的。我是老了，你不應該灰心，得好好幹一下。」</p>
<p>父親平常是不相信什麼命運的，而此刻他只好用命運來解釋這意外的禍災了。</p>
<p>為着個家，二十年來，父親永遠在外勞碌着，回家的時候是不多，就是回來也不過住個一天半天便又忽忙地走了。現在父親是有着較充分的時間可以居家了，可是這並不是安閒的休息，而是一種値得悲哀的困處，加以父親是一個最能用精力的，對任何事都有極大的雄圖的人，迢番則不能不空着手賦閒家中。他這時候心里一定有難說的苦楚。一個人在年輕時代受到如何厲害的打擊是無妨的，依然不會餒了志，因為他後頭的日子還長着，但是一個有了歲數的老年者，如父親似的，在暮年間，用一生心血慘淡建造的事業不幸失敗，這刺激是將父親晚境佈滿陰暗，凄凉，的感覺</p>
<p>也如父親期待於自己似的，我明白此後能够使他有一些稍為愉快的日子，唯有自己的努力丁，是的，父親磨折了大半輩子，如今老了，事業也摧了，就是不的話，自己也正該把壓在父親肩上那重擔子承接過來，讓他舒服地歇歇的。於是我又懷着悵悵的而又塡滿振奮的心離開了破落的家。</p>
<p>這些日子，便時時掛念着父親寂寞的暮年，寂寞的心，以及困厄的家境，想到了這，一方面往往會起緊了作事的勁，但思緒又不禁因此繚亂，我希望從自己的生活上盡量節省，寄點錢回去，在經濟上加以補助，使父親有點兒快藥，使困厄的家鬆了些，給父親寂寞的心添點慰藉。可是數年一忽過去了，這其間自己的日子尙且不易打發，有顧不了的情形，怎麽還能顧到家呢，我恨自己，咒詛自己，父親養了我這麽大，而我幾乎述自己都不能站穩了足，父親是怎樣殷切地對我　着幻美的夢想啊！然而我願我終有一日償了父親的夢想，至少不使他失望。</p>
<h3>舊書攤及其主人（風物篇之一）</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>在都會的街角裏，三三南兩地擺着舊書攤子，幾個破木箱，亂七八糟地塞着許許多多的破殘的，汚舊的本子，從「共和國敎科書」起，到皮面燙金的原版莎氏比亞全集的殘缺的本子為止，中問便有着雜亂得出奇的東西：在政治學大綱的貼鄰放着一二本張資平的小說，在免疫學旁邊却排着電影女明星小史；正跟着這些書本子的遇合的離奇一樣，它們，縱然是披着各種不同的外衣與含着相差得不可計算的不相關的內容，而一種破舊的，衰老的神色却又都奇怪地相一同着啊。它們被塞在一起，被放在街頭，讓許多抱着「砂裏淘金」的選着自己所合意的拿回去。人們這本翻翻，那本翻翻，於是這些飽經世故的，輾轉給從一個人的手裏又移到別一個人手裏去的，經過了多少種不同的生活，又看過了多少不同的人的破殘的書本，便更加迅速地一天天地衰老下去，週殘不去了；那些永遠找不到受主，永遠失掉了人底喜歡的書籍，便祗能靜靜地躺在一角，在回憶着昔日的榮華，借着它來忘掉現存的厄運了。</p>
<p>而那些書，也眞多像飽經世故而終於衰落了的人們啊！人拿起一本腥紅面子的，精裝燙金的美麗的戀愛小說來，譬如說，人也許看得到有的還在俳頁上寫着半消褪了的動人的獻詞，從這兒，也許還能描摹得出過去了的紫色的風情罷？可是現在，這書的容顏已經在人底搬弄中勞碌地衰敗了，而被載在俳頁上的人與事件呢，也許也跟着褪减去了罷？</p>
<p>人在書攤面前，有翻着看着的；也有些「落魄書生」（？），在貧困中失去了生活的武器，便悄悄地拿幾本破書出來，喁喁地哀求式地向書攤老板「商量」一下，把這些書換幾個角子打發過一個明天；而老板倒全懂得一點心理學的，便裝起不在意的樣子稱斤算兩地收買來了。於是再等待着在另一個需要的主顧面前用四五倍以上的價錢慢慢地賣出去，這樣他也把日子打發開了。</p>
<p>人拿起一本書，向老板問價錢；於是，他先看一看書的裝訂，厚薄，之後再看一看你底神色，最後才隨便看一看書名（其實看與不看全是一樣的）；譬如說是一本硬面燙金的厚厚的書，卽使是一本樣子簿，也會討上三四元錢的價，你如果說他不懂，他是不甘服的；「別瞧我不識貨，小的時候還讀過中學，模範讀本也讀到第六册呢。」不錯，也許還能半三不四的讀出「莎士比亞」的名字，與「魯濱遜飄流記」的書名，憑這一點，他佔着書的價格。如果人嫌貴，他就會告訴你書好，成本大，生意難做——買的苛刻，還有，在查馬路的巡捕面上也得結交一下子，開銷大，化費多，等等，等等……</p>
<p>眞的，近來這幾年，就是老板也覺得擺舊書攤這生意也實在難做了，想改行，可是又不能幹別的；年紀大了，而且最該死的，就是攪上了鴉片，近來是「紅珠子」不能斷了。他駡世界不公平，駡天沒有眼睛：自己是讀完六册模範讀本的，可是沒有飯吃，還得天天在大街上擺書攤過日子，還得……</p>
<p>他越想越生氣，越想越糊塗了。</p>

<h3>Han Zhanggong Dike: Danger at the Restricted Section Reduced; Hankou River Level Recedes Again Yesterday, Various Dikes Gradually Becoming Stable</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Today, the Hankou water level is 50 feet and 3 inches, a decrease of 2 inches compared to yesterday. The water level outside Zhanggong Dike is 53 feet, a decrease of 5 inches compared to yesterday. The upstream Sichuan water has also receded, but the Xiang River has slightly risen, but it is not a concern. The water level in the upper reaches of the Xiang River is decreasing. After emergency construction at the restricted section of Zhanggong Dike, the danger has been reduced. The remaining sections, as well as the dikes in Wuhan and the Wuhui Dike, have been rescued with all available materials and funds, and are reportedly gradually becoming stable. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou water level on the 19th was 50 feet and 3 inches, a decrease of 2 inches compared to the 18th. The water level in the upper reaches of Yichang, Chang River, and Yuezhou is also gradually decreasing. If the clear weather continues, Wuhan can safely weather the crisis. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Hundreds of miles of people's dikes around Wuhan have collapsed, leaving no signs of habitation. Zhanggong Dike is still in danger. The restricted section collapsed inwards by more than 20 zhang yesterday, and Jin Jutang supervised thousands of laborers to rescue it. Seepage occurred at Fenjin Furnace, and the water level in Danshui Pond decreased slightly. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water receded 5 inches on the 18th, with a water mark of 50.3. Various agencies are still on high alert. The dangerous construction at the restricted section of Zhanggong Dike has been secured under the supervision of Jin Jutang, Chief of Staff of the Police Headquarters, and police brigades. The collapse of the Wuchang Wuhui Dike for three miles has also been salvaged. The Yonggan Dike in Xishui and the Qichun Yuanfeng Dike collapsed. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water receded 3 inches in the morning. Ye Peng still went to Zhang Dike for inspection. Foreigners generally hope that Ye will continue to be responsible. Xu Shiying arrived in Hankou late at night by Jiang'an and will inspect the disaster area around Tianmen within days. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water in Wuhan receded and the dikes are safe. Sections two and three of Zhang Dike are under the responsibility of the Jianghan Bureau, while sections one and four are under the responsibility of the Municipal Government. Yang Silian arrived at the dike on the 19th to supervise the work. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Government passed a resolution on the 19th for public servants to donate salaries to aid disaster relief, with the Provincial Committee donating 30 percent. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Villages and towns in the Hankou River area have been flooded, and the disaster victims are both hungry and sick. Deaths are inevitable. They live on mountains or dikes, and the shelters are very crowded. Most suffer from stomach problems. It is reported that the Hubei government has allocated 3,000 yuan for disaster relief, but the most urgent needs are medical supplies and food. It is reported that various agencies and groups are currently distributing food and medicine in the Wuhan area, but the needs in the interior are even more urgent, as epidemics may break out. This morning, a Reuters reporter learned from rescuers that cholera prevention drugs and serum have been transported by the church to Hanchuan, where the church has opened a small-scale disaster relief shelter. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou water level yesterday morning was 50.5 feet, and this morning it was 50.3 feet, a total decrease of two inches. The situation of the disaster victims in the restricted area yesterday will be inspected in the Hankou River area first. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Xueliang denied taking over flood prevention duties. He told a Reuters reporter that flood prevention affairs are still the responsibility of Ye Peng and the Flood Prevention Committee. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) (Sent at 3:40 PM) Terrible news of the flood is received here daily. According to foreigners who arrived here this morning, the area downstream of Yichang has become a vast ocean. It is astonishing that those piloting ships are able to recognize the river channels. Along the way, villages not yet submerged are seen, surrounded by water, resembling isolated islands in the sea. These elevated areas and dikes that have not been submerged are crowded with disaster victims and livestock, but they are isolated from the outside world, have nothing to eat, and can only wait for death. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After Ye Peng resigned as the flood prevention supervisor, he remained in the Police Department. Chief of Staff Jin Jutang and Deputy Brigade Commander of the Police Brigade Shen Cheng are stationed at Zhang Dike to supervise the work. Many soldiers of the Police Brigade are stationed at the dike to assist. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun telegraphed Ye on the 18th, saying that he is tied to the safety of Hankou City, and requested that he continue to preside over flood prevention even after adjustments, to comfort the people's hopes. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Nanping area of Hanchuan collapsed, resulting in the collapse of all thirty-six surrounding earthen embankments, increasing the severity of the disaster. The stench of corpses from Xiangfan reached as far as a hundred miles away. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Flood Prevention Committee expanded its organization, adding five groups: General Affairs, Engineering, Micro-use, Transportation, and Suppression. The Jianghan Bureau received a stern telegram from the Economic Council on the 18th regarding the protection of the Han Zhang Dike, and they were strictly instructed to continue. Due to Yang Silian's illness, Shi Xiaozhong, the Section Chief of the Bureau, was stationed at the dike. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) As of the 18th, the flood-affected area in Hubei Province reached forty counties and cities. The China Relief Commission telegraphed the Hubei Disaster Relief Association on the 18th to investigate the area and quantity of losses in the disaster area. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Under the command of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, work on Zhanggong Dike was slower today due to a slight shortage of food and materials. On the morning of the 18th, the restricted section collapsed inwards by 160 feet, with cracks extending for more than 40 feet. Only two feet of the dike surface remained uncollapsed, creating another serious situation. The Municipal Government ordered the requisition of 10,000 sacks and 30,000 steamed buns and ordered workers to rescue the dike. Ye Peng still sent personnel to supervise, and the situation stabilized somewhat in the evening. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: Concerned About the Unbreached Dikes, Telegrammed Provincial Governments Along the River to Strive for Rescue</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed provincial governments along the river, instructing them to redouble their efforts to rescue the unbreached trunk dikes and people's embankments, and not to be negligent in the slightest.

The Wuhu Red Swastika Society has formed a special rescue team to salvage corpses along the river to prevent epidemics. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Wuhu) Liu Zhenhua telegraphed the Commissioners of the Sixth and Seventh Districts of Northern Anhui, instructing them to quickly convene the county magistrates of Su and Meng to discuss effective measures to prevent the southward invasion of the Yellow River water and to conduct surveys at any time.

<p>(Zhenjiang) The person in charge of the Construction Department stated that the Yellow River water has not yet reached Micro Lake because there is still a section of high ground north of Zhaoyang and Nanyang Lakes. It must overflow this high ground before reaching Jiangsu Province. Currently, the gaps in the dikes of Linpu have two places where the flow has stopped.

The water is also flowing south through the counties of Jiaxiang and Jining, pouring into Nanyang Lake through the Zhu River and Zhao Wang Rivers, and flowing into the southern part of Nawang Lake after breaching the banks of the Wen River in Wenshang County.

<h3>The Expansion of the Cement Industry</h3>
<p>— 磬</p>
<p>In this era of economic recession sweeping the nation, when industry and commerce are at their lowest ebb, the cement industry stands alone as having achieved outstanding performance. Among China's cement factories, only a few, such as Qixin, China Cement, and the Guangdong Provincial Cement Plant, are of a larger scale. However, due to their unique advantages, they have flourished in recent years. Tracing the root causes of their prosperity reveals more than just one factor. Firstly, from the perspective of consumption, the rapid progress of domestic construction projects and the vigorous development of building construction in various regions have led to a significant increase in the demand for cement. Secondly, the import tariffs on cement have been increasing year by year, preventing foreign cement from being devalued and dumped on the market. This has allowed domestic production to monopolize the domestic market without the threat of foreign competition. As for production, cement manufacturing belongs to the heavy industry category. Equipment costs are substantial, making it difficult to establish new factories easily. Therefore, although the cement industry stands out like a crane among chickens, adding a touch of spring to our ailing national industries, the rise and flourishing of other industries remain unheard of.</p>
<p>Recently, domestic cement factories, recognizing the difficulty of new competitors emerging and the unprecedented success achievable in recent years, have been seeking to add new machinery and expand production. For example, Tangshan Qixin Cement Company plans to invest 2.4 million yuan in Anhui to establish the Jiangnan Cement Company, complementing its parent factory in North China. The Guangdong Provincial Cement Plant is adding a second new kiln, increasing its daily production from 1,600 barrels to 2,800 barrels. Longtan China Cement Company recently increased its capital to 4.5 million yuan and added a new factory, expanding its daily production to 4,000 barrels (from its original 2,500 barrels per day). In Longhua, the Shanghai Cement Company has also increased its capital to 2 million yuan and is planning to build a second factory, moderately expanding its production capacity.</p>
<p>The expansion of various factories is indeed a somewhat comforting phenomenon for our national industry. However, there is something that still troubles us. Although the cement industry has been thriving recently, if the domestic economic recession persists for a long time, it will inevitably suffer some impact. Now, without considering the surrounding environment, factories are competing to expand and increase production, making overproduction in the future almost certain. Even looking at the current situation, although the selling prices of various factories are adjusted by the National Cement Business Office, price competition among competitors is still unavoidable. If production increases sharply and supply does not meet demand, the difficulty in sales and marketing will be even greater than it is today. The crisis ahead is difficult to ignore. We still remember that five or six years ago, domestic cement factories suffered greatly. Despite struggling and fighting hard, they incurred losses year after year, almost collapsing. Now that the worst is over and they are finally catching their breath, it seems appropriate to learn from the past and approach the current expansion plans with caution.</p>
<h3>Rather Die Free Than Live as Slaves: Abyssinia Determined to Resist; King Addresses Parliament, Inspiring Morale for National Sacrifice; With Heaven's Timing, Geographical Advantage, and Human Harmony, We Will Resolutely Fight to the End to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Today, the King delivered a passionate speech to the House of Lords, deeply moving the hearts of the people. One passage read, "Warriors, emulate the bravery of your ancestors. Regardless of age, jointly resist the aggressors. If necessary, your King will shed blood on the battlefield for Abyssinia and its independence, without hesitation. It is far better to die for freedom than to live as slaves. If a peaceful solution cannot be found in the last minute, Abyssinia will reach out to God for grace, fighting to the last man." The King also mentioned that Italy had been plotting to conquer Abyssinia for forty years. The Abyssinian government had been willing to compromise and seek peaceful solutions to recent border disputes. However, Italy did not understand and was vigorously preparing for war, determined to fulfill its ambition. The King finally criticized Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and reaffirmed Abyssinia's determination to resist the enemy. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Emperor's address to Parliament yesterday deeply impressed the audience. He stated that he would not hesitate to sacrifice his life for the sake of the nation. He also encouraged Abyssinian women to encourage the warriors to bravely fight the enemy and provide them with various forms of assistance. "We should bravely face the enemy. Even the most modern military equipment cannot force us to abandon our duty to defend our homeland." After describing the origins of the events and Abyssinia's efforts to seek mediation from the League of Nations, the Emperor declared that Italy had been plotting to invade Abyssinia for forty years. This conspiracy had been manifested in military actions since last year, leading to the incidents in Gonda and Walwal. Italy had been opening military bases near Abyssinian territory. "We do not want war, but for the sake of national dignity, we must refuse to become an Italian protectorate. Now that the war is approaching, once hostilities begin, our conscience can be clear before Heaven and Earth. Even if Abyssinia has only one soldier left, we will defend our independence to the end." The Emperor then called on the people to unite and face the national crisis together, finally shouting, "Long live Abyssinia! We will die for Abyssinia's freedom! God bless us!" The Abyssinian nobles, governors of various states, and government officials in Parliament were greatly moved and responded with enthusiastic applause. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Today, the Emperor made a strong speech to Parliament, criticizing Italian Prime Minister Mussolini as encouraging war and inciting morale in order to create a glorious record in history. He also expressed his willingness to personally lead the Abyssinian army in a desperate battle, so that Italy could see that Abyssinia was a united nation, strong enough to defend its country. The diplomatic community attaches great importance to the Emperor's speech, as it indicates that the Emperor has given up hope for arbitration between the two countries. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) According to an Abyssinian official in London, the Italian-Abyssinian war can only be averted by the intervention of the major powers. However, Abyssinia no longer holds this hope. The King will ride a white horse and personally lead the army to fight the enemy. Abyssinia has a million brave soldiers who believe in God and are willing to die on the battlefield, but they will sacrifice their lives at a great price. Women will also assist their men on the battlefield and encourage the army to fight to the death. With human harmony, the Abyssinian army, accustomed to living in mountainous and gravelly terrain, will surely gain the advantages of favorable weather and geographical conditions.

<h3>Italy's War Preparations Accelerate; Conscription of Famous Mountain Troops; 500,000 Young People Receive Military Training</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy will conscript a large unit of famous Alpini mountain troops to send to Italian Africa, as these troops are accustomed to mountain warfare and are of great value. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met today with General Graziani, Inspector General of Military Training, who presented a report on the 1936 training program, which includes increasing the number of instructors by 40,000, allowing 500,000 more young people to receive military training. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Italian Americans in the United States Volunteer; US Invokes 1818 Law to Prevent Black Recruitment for Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(New York) According to the Italian Consulate here, hundreds of Italian nationals in the US have registered with the consulate, willing to go to East Africa to join the army. On the other hand, various anti-fascist groups have organized a "Temporary Committee to Defend Abyssinia," opposing Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. As for the recruitment of black American volunteers to go to Africa to help Abyssinia, it has been suspended due to a lack of applicants in recent days. This is because the United States passed a law in 1818 stipulating that any US citizen who joins a foreign army automatically loses US citizenship and is subject to three years of imprisonment and a fine of $1,000. The State Department is now invoking this law, stating that it applies equally to those who join the armies of both Italy and Abyssinia. Upon hearing this news, the general black population became wary and immediately stopped applying. Congressman Dickstein, Chairman of the House Immigration Committee, has also proposed a bill requiring that US citizens who have already joined the armies of both Italy and Abyssinia be deprived of all civil rights.

<p>Abyssinia Accepts Request; Willing to Join Red Cross Convention</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: Today, the Abyssinian government informed the Swiss government of its willingness to abide by the 1929 International Red Cross Convention on the relief and transport of wounded and sick soldiers on the battlefield. Discussions on this matter are ongoing. This shows that the Abyssinian government is now preparing to resist Italian aggression by force. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: Recently, the International Committee of the Red Cross sent a letter to the Emperor of Abyssinia, requesting that the Abyssinian government join the International Red Cross Convention signed in Geneva in 1929, so that in the event of war between Italy and Abyssinia, Abyssinian wounded and sick soldiers could be rescued by the Red Cross. The Abyssinian government has accepted this request, and negotiations on joining the convention are underway. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Italy Sends Note to Abyssinian Government; Protesting Border Incidents</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the Italian government sent a note to Abyssinia stating that on May 31, there were renewed attacks on the Eritrean border. In one instance, Abyssinian raiders invaded the Metra Plain, killing several shepherds and their families, stealing 4,000 head of cattle, and kidnapping several people into slavery. Italian troops drove them out of the country, but only to the border. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council; Scheduled to Meet at the End of This Month; France's Position Is Difficult</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has today sent telegrams to the governments of the countries belonging to the Council, requesting them to attend a special meeting of the Council before the end of this month. The League of Nations Daily News claims that this step was decided two days ago. The reason for the delay in sending the telegrams until today is that there was still contact in the middle. It is also understood that if the arbitration method continues, it will not be successful, so it is necessary to convene a special meeting of the Council. The administrative meeting will probably be convened by Litvinov on the 28th of this month. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Council of the League of Nations is likely to meet on July 29 to consider the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. All circles in Britain hope that Italy will allow a full discussion, because it is believed that Italy's clear announcement of its intentions will help resolve the case. But Italy certainly does not want to be criticized by Abyssinian representatives before the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political circles here believe that the three countries of Britain, France and Italy cannot find a peaceful solution to the Abyssinian issue, so they hope that the Council of the League of Nations will fully discuss this issue when it meets at the end of this month. Le Figaro reported that France's position in Geneva will be very difficult. On the one hand, it cannot offend Italy, and on the other hand, it cannot actively help Italy destroy the principles it has always tried to maintain. Le Peuple stated that since Italy does not agree with France's proposal to condemn Abyssinia, it can only listen to Abyssinia's request to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Government Policy; Respecting League of Nations Obligations; Eden Answers Member's Question</h3>
<p>(London) Asked in the House of Commons today whether it will maintain Abyssinia's League of Nations membership, Minister Eden replied that the British government is trying to peacefully resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute on the one hand and fully respects the rights and obligations of League of Nations member states on the other, and will continue to do so in the future. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) A member of the House of Commons asked whether the government would agree to separate the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles, so that Germany could return to the League of Nations. Minister Eden replied that the British government firmly believed that the combination of the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles was not the only reason preventing Germany from rejoining the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Hoare's Appeal; Berlin's Attitude Is Very Cold</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare made a diplomatic speech in the House of Commons on the 11th of this month, appealing to German leader Hitler to participate in a collective peace organization. According to a diplomatic reporter from the Daily Telegraph, the German government will not give a satisfactory response to Hoare's appeal. At the Stresa Conference, Hitler declared that he was prepared to sign a multilateral non-aggression pact. This non-aggression pact can coexist with mutual assistance pacts concluded by the countries concerned. Germany has now ceased to reiterate this declaration. On the contrary, the German government believes that after the signing of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, the Locarno Treaty has lost part of its effectiveness. Furthermore, Hoare reiterated in his speech that European issues should be discussed at the same time, which was a great disappointment to Berlin. Therefore, negotiations on the Western European Air Pact may not make any progress in the near future. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>France Suggests; Ethiopia as an Italian Protectorate; Like Britain's Position in Egypt</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources here today, France has suggested that Italy be allowed to make Abyssinia a protectorate, like Britain's position in Egypt. It is also understood that Britain, France and Italy have repeatedly exchanged views in recent days to resolve the East African dispute. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov; The Mystery of Visiting Rome; Meeting with the Italian Prime Minister Is Not the Time; It Is Said That He Will Go to Paris Via Italy</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is considered here that the statement that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is not yet the time. Mussolini did not mention this matter when he met with Soviet Ambassador Aydin yesterday. Well-informed sources believe that Litvinov may go to Paris via Italy, using this opportunity to meet with the Italian Prime Minister, but they do not believe that Litvinov will mediate the Italian-Abyssinian dispute in his capacity as Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute; Japan Takes a Wait-and-See Attitude; Foreign Minister Hirota Explains to the Italian Ambassador That Sugimura's Diplomatic Missteps Have Been Criticized</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Italian Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Auriti, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 3:00 p.m. on the 19th to inquire about the true intentions of the Japanese government regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Foreign Minister Hirota answered as follows:</p>
<p>When Ambassador Sugimura took office last October, the Japanese government originally intended to consider Abyssinia important due to trade issues, so recently it wanted to exchange ambassadors with it. However, rumors were prevalent at that time, saying that Japan was selling weapons to Abyssinia and that there were so-called political contacts or political ambitions. But this is not true. A directive will be issued when necessary to clarify this intention. However, no instructions have been issued regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The Japanese government does not yet know the positions of the two countries of Italy and Abyssinia, so it is not yet known whether this issue will be resolved peacefully or whether the situation is serious. In short, both Italy and Abyssinia are friendly countries of Japan, so the government has no comments to make at this time and intends to continue to wait and see. However, the Japanese government sincerely hopes for a resolution to the dispute between the two countries. (Domei News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Ambassador Sugimura's diplomatic blunder, Foreign Ministry officials regard it as very serious and are investigating the truth. However, Ambassador Sugimura's slip of the tongue was probably due to a misunderstanding of the true intentions of the Japanese government. In view of this, the Foreign Ministry has decided to issue instructions to all ambassadors stationed abroad, detailing the Japanese government's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, so as to prevent ambassadors stationed abroad from taking wrong actions, so that the government can take all precautions. This procedure has now been taken. (Domei News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Yotaro Sugimura, stated when he met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on the 16th that the Japanese government has no political interest in Abyssinia. The Japanese Foreign Ministry considers that Ambassador Sugimura's words and actions were not only an unauthorized act based on the instructions of the domestic government, but also resulted in other countries misunderstanding the fundamental policy of the Japanese government, and it is obvious that the Italian government used this statement, so it is considered regrettable. After Ambassador Sugimura's report arrives, it will be announced that the Japanese government is indeed concerned about the Abyssinian issue, especially in the economic field, because trade with Abyssinia is developing year by year, especially in this area. However, it has no political ambitions, such as the desire to make Abyssinia a protectorate, as rumored by a certain country. The Japanese government has no intention of participating in the current dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, but will only observe the situation. The Italian government has always hated the brisk sales of Japanese goods in Abyssinia and has openly expressed its opinion to drive out Japanese goods. However, when Ambassador Sugimura met with Prime Minister Mussolini, he only emphasized that Japan had no intention of making Abyssinia a protectorate, but did not express Japan's active views on economic matters, and did not request instructions from the domestic government on this matter, but arbitrarily expressed frivolous words and deeds, allowing the Italian government to obtain the statement that "the Japanese government does not care about Abyssinia and recognizes Italy's actions in Abyssinia," which is a major diplomatic failure. The Foreign Ministry has now telegraphed Ambassador Sugimura, asking for what purpose he met with the Italian Prime Minister, and whether the statement issued by the Italian government is an official statement. If the Italian government issued the statement without Japan's understanding, Japan can request that its content be withdrawn or corrected. In short, this issue is a recent diplomatic issue that deserves attention. (Jiji Press, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Position Adopted by the United States; Hoping to Resolve Peacefully Based on Treaties; Not Intending to Send Personnel to Attend League of Nations Hearings</h3>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of State Phillips stated today that the US envoys abroad have been authorized to notify the position of the United States on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute to various countries. Phillips also said that this position is to advocate the peaceful resolution of all disputes based on existing treaties in order to maintain world peace. It is quite enough that the official declaration of the United States was issued before the meeting of the League of Nations, and that this meeting received the moral support of the United States. Phillips also said that the new US Chargé d'Affaires to Abyssinia, Engelte, will arrive in Addis Ababa in a week. Mr. Engelte was formerly the First Secretary of the US Embassy in Egypt. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of State Phillips stated here today that the governments of all countries are willing to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute peacefully. The US government has instructed its envoys abroad to explain the attitude of the United States to the governments of their respective countries. The United States does not want to send representatives to attend the League of Nations Council in Geneva to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian issue, because this dispute is mostly related to European countries. Secretary of State Hull invited the British, Italian and French ambassadors to the United States to the State Department on July 10 and 11 to inquire about their opinions on the current situation and explain the position of the United States in detail. Hull sent a note to the Italian Ambassador, telling him that the United States would be deeply concerned about hostile actions in North Africa and hoped that he would not resort to force to resolve the issue. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Thievery Pervades; Peace Treaties Torn into Waste Paper; Pittman's Indignant Words</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Pittman stated to the Senate today that it is most unfortunate that the signatories of the peace treaties are unwilling to make brave expressions to other signatories, causing all peace treaties to become waste paper. This spirit of thievery is pervasive and rampant, not only destroying the Treaty of Versailles, but also all the sacred and solemn non-war pacts and various covenants guaranteeing the territory of weak countries in which we have participated. Pittman further said that in a world where justice is destroyed, the United States should rely on its powerful army and navy to prevent the aggression of ambitious countries.

<h3>Hitler's Special Envoy; Will Make a Trip to Paris; To Discuss Colonial and Loan Issues</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to "Business Daily News", German Disarmament Representative Ribbentrop, a confidant of Hitler, will come to Paris in the near future to hold talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. The content of the talks will include Germany's colonial demands and loan issues. This loan will be signed simultaneously in London and Paris. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Political and Religious Disputes; Hitler Will Intervene Severely; Appointing Kerr as Minister of Religious Affairs</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Leader Hitler has recently appointed Minister Kerr, a member of the cabinet, as Minister of Religious Affairs, in charge of religious issues. According to this position, it was originally handled jointly by the German Minister of Interior and the Minister of Education and the Prussian Minister of Interior. Kerr was one of the first old members to join the National Socialist Party and is a good friend of Prussian Prime Minister Goering. Goering's marriage this spring was officiated by Kerr. Kerr served as Minister of Justice of Prussia. Later, due to the incorporation into the German Ministry of Justice, Kerr joined the German cabinet as a member of the cabinet. He is usually known for being radical. His appointment as Minister of Religious Affairs seems to indicate that the government will severely interfere in religious disputes. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prussian Prime Minister Goering recently issued an order to administrative agencies and police forces to strictly restrain all activities of the Church and Catholic groups, and listed the crimes of the clergy, saying that they abused religious authority to interfere in political issues and refused to accept the unified views of the National Socialist Party. Goering specifically stipulated a principle, saying that "hereafter, all clergy should sincerely protect the National Socialist Party and the country without reservation." After this order was issued, the tense relationship between Germany and the Holy See is bound to become more serious. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Greek Cabinet Resignation; Deputy Prime Minister Returns to Capital from Foreign Tour, Immediately Resigns; Prime Minister Suppresses Restoration Movement</h3>
<p>Athens: Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, Gondylis, and Minister of Agriculture, Diadokos, have recently resigned, so the Tsaldaris Cabinet has submitted its resignation. The succeeding cabinet will probably still be formed by Tsaldaris. Gondylis will no longer enter the cabinet, but the position of Foreign Minister will be held by former Foreign Minister Maximos. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Tsaldaris cabinet has recently submitted its resignation. The reason for the cabinet resignation is that restorationist cabinet members, Minister of the Army Gondylis and Minister of Agriculture Diadokos, advocated declaring a restoration. At that time, Minister of Interior Rallis and Minister of Social Affairs Gyergos were not in the capital, so they requested an explanation on the grounds that the cabinet's actions were consistent. However, Prime Minister Tsaldaris refused to comply and only asked him to declare to the National Assembly that the government would maintain a neutral attitude on the issue of the form of government during the period of the referendum, so as to ensure the integrity of the referendum. Therefore, Gondylis and Diadokos resigned, and the cabinet was dissolved. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek Tsaldaris cabinet has resigned today due to the restoration issue. When asked whether he approved of the restoration, Prime Minister Tsaldaris replied that he would publish an article after his tour of Germany. He intends to go to Berlin today. Tsaldaris later declared that he would form a new government according to his own wishes, and he would be personally responsible for public affairs. The dedicated Chief of the Army, General Kondylis, is a supporter of maintaining the Republic. He told newspaper reporters that even if he does not join the new government, he still intends to support it. It is expected that the new government will be formed tonight. According to reports, a referendum will be held next month to quickly determine whether the people support the Republic or favor the restoration issue. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Antiquities Bound for England – Arrive Next Monday Under Tight Security in Portsmouth and London</h3>

<h3>Boxer Indemnity Fund Aids – Chinese Students Transfer to Germany and America</h3>
<p>(London) Of the Chinese students sent to England last year with funds from the British Boxer Indemnity Refund Board, three will soon go to Germany to continue their studies, and another will go to the United States within days.

If a tax is imposed on raw silk, which Japan, a cotton customer, considers most important, it will have a very adverse impact on US cotton exports. Therefore, this bill should be withdrawn." After Smith stated his opinion, it was approved, and the rayon and raw silk tax bill was rejected without a vote. (Nichi-Ren, 19th)</p>

<h3>French Finance Minister – Explains Deflationary Decrees</h3>
<p>Economic Recovery Requires Balanced Budget First – Currency Devaluation Would Greatly Harm the People – Opposition Voices from Veterans and Civil Servants</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Finance Minister recently gave a statement to reporters, explaining the government's "Decree Laws" issued yesterday to balance the budget, stating briefly: "Whether or not the nation needs to devalue the currency is something I will not discuss for now. However, balancing the budget is ultimately necessary. It is important to know that the various sacrifices that the nation is asking of its people today are unavoidable sooner or later. If the government were to devalue the currency to solve the immediate difficulties, it would make the subsequent cabinet's task of reducing expenditures extremely difficult. However, if that were the case, the people's losses would be even greater. After devaluation, those who live off investments in government bonds will see their income reduced by not only the 10 percent stipulated in the government's order, but by 20, 30, or even 40 percent. Furthermore, the wages of workers will not be able to increase in line with the rising cost of living, and the salaries of civil servants will, at least in the short term, certainly not be able to keep pace with prices. All of these will be inevitable phenomena at that time. The result will be that the middle class, the backbone of the nation, will all tend towards poverty. This is what the current government is trying to avoid. Now we are exerting all our strength to adjust finances and stabilize the currency, precisely in order to restore France to its former glory and revive its brilliance. However, only after implementing expenditure cuts will the government have the resources to consider plans to promote economic activity. Therefore, reducing expenditures is a prerequisite for economic recovery. In short, if we want to work for future prosperity, we must first be able to grasp the future." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Veterans and civil servants are now opposing the government's austerity measures. Civil servants have announced that they will hold a large meeting at the theater on Rue tonight at 6 PM, while veterans will also gather in a hall in the Latin Quarter. However, the government has banned public demonstrations on the streets. It is expected that veterans will eventually comply with the needs of the times. Even if workers in the postal service, railways, and other sectors strike in protest against wage cuts, the authorities will immediately replace them with unemployed workers. If necessary, the military will be used. Therefore, it is expected that these people will not take any action. At the same time, Parisian doctors have voluntarily reduced their fees by 10 percent as an example for other industries. Yesterday, stock prices on the stock exchange rebounded, and many believe that the government's orders are sufficient to solve the franc problem. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Western Shandong Half Sunken: Millions Grieve in More Than Ten Disaster-Stricken Counties, Han Fuju Appeals on Behalf of the Victims</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This time, the Yellow River breached at Yucheng, and the floodwaters submerged western Shandong. The floodwaters have been spreading for days, and the disaster area has been expanding. Juye, Jiaxiang, Yuncheng, Juancheng, Dongping, and the northern part of Heze are all in a vast expanse of water. Recent news has come that Jinan, Wenshang, and northeastern Dingtao have also been affected by the water. The situation is becoming increasingly severe. Yesterday, news came that the Yellow River at Shanzhou in the upper reaches rose sharply by seven chi on the 14th. The main current will arrive in Shandong in the coming days. If the water continues to overflow, not only will southern Shandong, including Jinxiang and Yutai, continue to become a watery land, but the disaster to northern Jiangsu will also be unavoidable. Although there are no accurate statistics on the disaster area, according to the authorities' estimate, the area from the breach to Dongping, Wenshang, and Jining is more than 300 li long and more than 80 li wide, covering an area of approximately 24,000 square li (Note: The entire province of Shandong is more than 540,000 square li). More than 5 million people have been affected. In Linpu alone, more than 200 people have died. It is difficult to count the number of deaths and injuries in other counties. Provincial Chairman Han Fuju is concerned that such a catastrophe has already occurred before the arrival of the main flood. If the breach is not quickly blocked, who knows what will happen once the main flood strikes? The disaster is huge, and no single province's resources can handle it. Although the Economic Commission has allocated 60,000 yuan, it is a drop in the bucket and does not help. Therefore, today (the 17th), I am sending another telegram to Chairman Jiang, Chairman Lin, the ministers of various departments, the Disaster Relief Commission, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, requesting that they quickly raise a large sum of money to provide emergency relief and block the breach. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Han's Telegram Requesting Relief and Breach Blocking: To Commander Chiang in Chengdu, Chairman Lin of the National Government in Nanjing, the Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Control, Judicial, and Examination Yuan, to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Disaster Relief Commission, and the Kaifeng Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. It is noted that the Yellow River breach in Juancheng and the request for funds to block the breach have been telegraphed. According to reports, the breach is gradually expanding, and the flooding is becoming more widespread. It is estimated that the area from the breach to Shanxian, Pingyi, Wenshang, and Jining is more than 300 li long and more than 80 li wide, and more than ten counties have been affected. If the river continues to rise and overflow to the south, then Shanxian, Dingtao, Jinxiang, Yutai, and other counties will inevitably be affected. Where the torrents reach, houses are destroyed, and people and animals are drowned. It is heard that more than 200 people have been drowned in Linpu village alone, and it is impossible to count the others. At the moment, the water is turbulent, and the area being inundated is increasing daily. The counties are doing their best to rescue the refugees, but there is no time to count the number of people affected. However, since the disaster area has reached more than ten counties, it is estimated that it is more than 5 million. The dead are gone, and the living are still waiting to be saved from the water. If we do not quickly raise relief and block the breach, then the refugees waiting for help will die of starvation and drowning. As the local official, Fuqu cannot feel at ease and is ashamed. Moreover, it is only the beginning of the first ambush season, and such a catastrophe has already occurred. If we delay for a long time, the breach cannot be blocked. Once the main flood strikes, the water demons will rage, and who knows what will happen. Therefore, this province is determined to save lives and block the breach and will spare no effort. However, the disaster is huge, and the financial resources of one province are really difficult to support. Although the National Economic Council has allocated 60,000 yuan, it is a drop in the bucket and does not help. I would like to express my sincere appeal again, representing the disaster victims, and implore you to quickly find a way to raise a huge sum of money to distribute emergency relief and handle the blocking of the breach in order to save the disaster victims. This urgent telegram cannot express the extent of anticipation. Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju's official seal.</p>
<h3>After the Overflow of the Huayang Embankment, the Disaster Situation in Hebei Province is Extremely Severe: The Three Counties of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming are in Danger of Being Submerged, with More Than 300 Affected Villages and More Than 100,000 Refugees</h3>
<p>—Shang Zhen Sends Telegram Across the Country Calling for Relief—</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Although the Yellow River water in Hebei has recently risen extremely violently, due to the breach in the downstream Shandong, the water has gradually receded, causing Hebei to be mostly safe for many days. In recent days, there has been heavy rain in Shaanxi, and the water has risen violently and continuously. The upper reaches have risen by more than three chi, and the lower reaches have also risen by about one chi. The Huayang Embankment has actually overflowed, and the water has directly hit the Taihang Embankment. Changyuan County is in danger of being submerged. It is estimated that more than 320 villages and more than 120,000 people have been affected, which is more serious than the previous breach of the Shiche Embankment, and the water level is higher than last year. Qi Shouan, Director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Qinglu, Magistrate of Changyuan County, have sent urgent telegrams to the province to report and request immediate relief. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government ordered the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction to properly plan for the aftermath. The Department of Civil Affairs has now sent Inspector Xin Yin with 5,000 yuan to Changyuan to handle emergency relief. The Department of Construction has also sent Supervision Committee Member Ouyang Weiyi to the Yellow River to work with Qi Shouan, Director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, to handle flood prevention. Ouyang sent a telegram to the province today, saying that he has arrived at the Yellow River and that the water has now receded and the danger has eased. Furthermore, the three counties of Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming have all been affected. It is estimated that Changyuan has overflowed, Dongming has sunk, and Puyang has been infiltrated, so the telegrams and telephones of the three counties have been cut off. Today, they sent telegrams to the province by express mail to continue reporting the disaster situation. Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen, because the disaster situation in this province is extremely severe, the provincial treasury has been empty for a long time, and there is no way to provide relief, especially telegraphed the whole country today, calling for relief for the Hebei disaster. The original text of the telegram requesting relief from Nan Zhen is recorded below:</p>
<p>Shang Zhen's Telegram Requesting Relief: To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and the Presidents of the various Yuan, Commander Jiang in Chengdu, the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, and Director Zhang of the Wuchang Provisional Headquarters, to the Nanjing Construction Committee, Economic Committee, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Disaster Relief Committee, Provincial and Municipal Governments, Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, various charitable organizations, groups, legal entities, schools, and newspapers. This province has repeatedly received telegrams from the Magistrate of Changyuan County regarding the sharp rise in the Yellow River water level and the dangerous situation. While ordering efforts to protect the region, the news continued to be reported that the river had overflowed on a day of good weather. It is estimated that more than 300 villages and more than 100,000 people have been affected, and fields, houses, and graves have been swept away by the flood. Crops and livestock have suffered the same fate. The drowning people are enduring death and waiting for rescue, and the starving people are waiting to be fed. The disaster is truly tragic and extremely urgent. Moreover, for the past three years, there have been endless reports of disasters, and the remaining people are exhausted and have little vitality left. Last year, the Guantai breach was successfully closed with the efforts of the central government and local areas. There were hopes for recuperation, but now we have suffered another catastrophe. It is indeed heartbreaking. Zhen has just assumed the position of provincial governor and suddenly heard of this tragic change. He is worried day and night. He is now allocating funds from the province's financial resources to send people to investigate and distribute relief, and will work with local officials and gentry to seek relief. However, the disaster is too great, and the provincial treasury has been empty for a long time, making it difficult to support on its own. We are relying on everyone for support. Please have mercy on the remaining people and the helpless and quickly find a way to provide relief. Zhen and more than 100,000 disaster victims pray deeply. The urgent telegram cannot express the extent of anticipation. Sincerely, Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, sealed. (17th)</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Xinye: Continuous Heavy Rain for Five Days, More Than 200,000 Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Xinye Correspondence: In Xinye County, Henan Province, from July 4 to July 8, there was heavy rain, non-stop all night, causing flash floods. The Baihe River, Tanghe River, Lihe River, and Qilihe River all burst at the same time. More than 10,000 villages were flooded, and hundreds of thousands of houses collapsed. Many people and livestock died, and there was much loss of grain, utensils, and other items. At the moment, the water is raging, and the heavy rain is pouring down. The water has reached the city walls, and the urban areas have become a watery land. Houses have been damaged, and the east and west city walls have collapsed. Tragic cries are shaking the four gates and the four suburbs. The county government and various agencies are currently discussing relief measures. The Xinye China Foreign Famine Relief Cultural Education Society has also sent a telegram appealing for relief. The telegram is as follows: To Shen Bao and various newspapers, as well as Chinese and foreign charitable organizations, China Medical Relief Association, Chinese Red Cross Society, Red Swastika Society, Overseas Chinese Association, China Foreign Famine Relief Committee. From the 4th to the 8th of this month, there was a sudden heavy rain in Xinye, and the river water rose sharply. The Baihe River, Tanghe River, Lihe River, and Tuanhe River all burst at the same time. The water was fierce, the city walls collapsed, and most of the houses in the urban areas were destroyed. Looking from the city, there is a vast expanse of water for dozens of miles, like a watery land. All the autumn crops have been submerged, and grain, houses, and clothing have been washed away. Many people and livestock have been drowned. More than 200,000 hungry people without clothes and food are trapped in the water, waiting to be fed. We sincerely request that the gentlemen of various Chinese and foreign organizations beg for emergency relief and give righteous soup on our behalf. We also hope that the major philanthropists, gentlemen, and ladies of Chinese and foreign overseas Chinese will generously donate to provide relief in order to rescue these more than 200,000 dying victims. The locality will be fortunate, the people will be fortunate, and the great kindness of the gentlemen will be immeasurable. This urgent telegram cannot express the extent of anticipation. Sincerely, The China Foreign Famine Relief Cultural Education Society, Zhongshan Avenue, Xinye, Henan. (Seal)</p>
<h3>The Tragic State of Flooding in Yidu: Water Level Exceeds Twenty-Year Mark by Three Feet</h3>
<p>Yidu Correspondence: Yidu County, Hubei Province, is situated along the Yangtze River and at the mouth of the Qing River (the Qing River is formed by the confluence of the Changyang River and the Hanyang River, flowing into the Yangtze River at Yidu County). Many residents along the river have built dikes for their livelihood. On June 28th of this year, there was already a heavy rain. On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, residents along the riverfront suffered severely from flooding, with countless people, livestock, houses, implements, and timber being submerged. (In the Guolu Tan area, eight miles from the city, and in the timber businesses on Shangjie Street in the county seat, seventy to eighty percent of the timber was washed away, worth no less than a million strings of cash.) The water level exceeded that of the past thirty years by three feet, which is rare in recorded history. Aside from the areas along the Yangtze River such as Shawan, Hengqi, and the collapsed embankments, as well as locations farther from the city where news is difficult to obtain for the time being and will be investigated later, the following is a record of the extent of the disaster suffered by residents along the Qing River and the tragic conditions in the Chadian Township, to provide a general overview of the disaster in Yidu. Chadian Township is located downstream on the Qing River, at the confluence of the Changyang and Hanyang Rivers, only about five li from the mouth of the Qing River. It has over a thousand residents who make a living through small trade. On the night of the 3rd of this month, when the Qing River suddenly swelled, water flooded the residents' houses. Following the usual practice of avoiding floods in previous years, they climbed onto the upper floors to take shelter. Unexpectedly, both the inner and outer rivers continued to rise. By the afternoon of the 4th, the lower houses in the entire town were completely submerged, with only the roof beams visible. In the raging torrents, countless people and houses were swept away by the waves. The elderly and weak climbed onto the roofs, calling for help, while the able-bodied clung to trees, shouting for rescue. The suffering was indescribable. Those who floated on debris or excrement on the water's surface and were rescued ashore included four members of Li Jiangye's family in the upper part of Chadian (all standing on the roof, they floated to the Yang Jia Zhi area in the high ground behind the town, where they were rescued by Yang Chengzhen, which is one example). There were also those who broke through the rafters and climbed from the roof onto tree branches to seek rescue. The various perilous situations were too numerous to recount. It is reported that there were three multi-story buildings in Chadian Township whose roof beams were not submerged: (1) The house of Yang Runzhi, which was extremely tall and towering. The roofs of the neighboring residents' houses only reached halfway up the walls of Yang's house. As a result, those trying to avoid the flood in the neighborhood climbed onto the roof, broke through the walls (there are now several holes in the wall), and crawled in to take shelter. This house sheltered one hundred forty to fifty flood victims, of whom over one hundred ten have now been rescued to the city. (2) The house of Li Jipei was also very tall, with the roof beams not submerged. Seventy to eighty people took shelter in his house. (3) The house of Li Lanyu had a tall pavilion in the middle that was not submerged. Many people on either side of the pavilion climbed onto the roof ridges and used ladders to enter the pavilion to avoid the flood. The number of people was approximately over one hundred. With the houses already submerged, the crops were out of the question. Only tree branches were visible in the vast expanse of water. As for the houses and fields in Anfu Township on the north bank of the river, many were washed away by the streams. In addition, the sweet potatoes and millet in the mountainous areas of the county were washed away along with the soil, the amount of which cannot be counted. The severity and extent of the disaster are evident. On the 6th of this month, the water level receded slightly, but the rain did not diminish, so optimism is unwarranted.</p>
<p>When the torrential rain poured down on the 4th of this month, all water transportation was cut off. It was not until noon on the 5th that one or two small boats (small, water-seeking boats that could only carry a few people) braved the danger and came to the city, reporting the above-mentioned flooding situation in Chadian Township to the various government agencies. The county government immediately consulted with the 34th Division of the stationed army and, under the supervision of the Chamber of Commerce, chartered the "Suiyuan" small steamship (a ship that transports passengers between Sha City and Yichang, which had sailed from Yichang early on the 5th and was docked there), towing three sailboats and two small boats to the Chadian Township area to rescue the victims. When the ship arrived at the township, it could not drop anchor because the Qing River current was too strong. It then sailed to the滩上 on the opposite bank (i.e., the mouth of the Hanyang River) and docked. The civilian boats docked behind the township, and the small boats were dispatched to various locations, loading people who had been flooded and transferring them to the civilian boats and then onto the steamship. The ship rescued and transported over a hundred people, and returned to the county seat due to darkness. The three sailboats and two small boats also carried over a hundred people back. In total, over two hundred people were rescued. In addition to those who went to live with relatives and friends on their own, there were still about a hundred people who were housed in the second section of the County Central Primary School. Half were men and half were women. The men lived in the classrooms downstairs, and the women lived in the classrooms upstairs. The Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting that night and decided that the small steamship would continue to bring more sailboats to the township the next morning, the 6th, to continue the rescue efforts. It is estimated that over two hundred male and female victims were rescued that day and were still housed in the designated second section of the primary school.</p>
<p>The victims who have been taken in only have the wet clothes they are wearing, and have nothing else. This is because the rescue boats only allow the victims to board and do not allow them to bring any belongings. Fortunately, all the agencies in the county seat and the ten gentry and the public have not only donated clothes for washing, but also gave out multiple loaves of bread to the victims when they arrived in the city on the 5th. On the 6th, all of them were fed porridge.</p>
<p>The above only refers to the few victims who were rescued from a small corner of Chadian Township. As for the victims in the nearby Dazhangping, Gejiaba, Wangshi, Niulutan, Changshouwan, Wu Han Wan, as well as Hanyang Wan, Weijiahe, Jitou You, and Bai Xin Jia Wan across the river, and the victims along the Yangtze River, most of them are gathering in the county seat, coughing and waiting to be fed. Therefore, on the 6th, the Yidu County government held an emergency meeting to both find ways to rescue the victims in the flood and plan a large-scale relief plan. As a result of this meeting, it is reported that over 3,000 yuan of emergency relief funds have been raised to provide emergency assistance.</p>
<h3>Xu Prefecture: Expediting the Construction of the Northern Jiangsu Dike; the Entire Dike Can Be Completed in About Fifteen Days</h3>
<p>With the breach of the Yellow River in Western Shandong, the Yellow River water is flowing through Yuncheng, Juye, Jining, and Jiaxiang to irrigate Weishan Lake. The Tongshan District Commissioner's Office, acting on the order of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, has instructed each county of Pei, Feng, Tong, Xiao, Dang, and Pi to uniformly prepare for flood prevention. In addition, the Commissioner's Office consulted local gentry and decided to build the Northern Jiangsu Dike on the south bank of Weishan Lake. Commissioner Shao went to Pei County the day before yesterday to supervise the work. Now the Yellow River water has flowed into Nanyang Lake, which is connected to Weishan Lake. Fortunately, the flow is not very rapid. Weishan Lake has risen slightly in recent days. The dike has been started. Supervising Inspector Ding Chaowu has also passed through Xu Prefecture from the province to inspect Pei County. Judging from the current situation, the Yellow River water is still relatively slow. However, if the breach in Western Shandong is not blocked and a large flow continues to come, then it is very worrying.</p>
<p>The Water Level of Weishan Lake is Rising Slightly: Pei County has set up sentries along the south bank of Weishan Lake to transmit reports. This afternoon, according to Yu Keyu, Chief of the First Section of the Commissioner's Office, who reported from Pei County by long-distance telephone, the water level of Weishan Lake rose yesterday. However, the water flow is not very large. The lake fields that dried up in the spring and the low滩上 along the lake are about half a li away from the water's edge. Chengzi Temple, located in the northernmost part of Pei County, is located on the west bank of Weishan Lake and connects to Nanyang Lake. The water level there has risen one foot. From this observation, the flow into Nanyang Lake is still slow. After the water entered Nanyang Lake, the water in Weishan Lake rose slightly, but there is no major flow into Weishan Lake. However, according to repeated telegrams from water surveyor Tian Suixiang in Jining, it seems that the flood prevention work in Western Shandong is lacking. The current water is not enough to cause harm, but it is difficult to determine whether a large flow will continue to arrive. In the past two days, Kong Xiangrong of the Yellow River Commission and Xu Xinwu of the Huai River Conservancy passed through Xu Prefecture from Bian to Beijing. They both said that they had inspected the breach at Linpuji. There were five breaches, with a flow rate of 4,000 cubic meters per second. Considering the capacity of Weishan Lake and the flow of the Grand Canal, neither is sufficient to accommodate the flow. Xu further suggested to the Commissioner's Office in Xu to shorten the completion time of the Northern Jiangsu Dike for prevention.</p>
<p>Construction of the Northern Jiangsu Dike: The Commissioner's Office has decided to name the dike to be built in the northern borders of Pei, Tong, and Feng Counties as the Northern Jiangsu Dike. Commissioner Shao went to the lakeside the day before yesterday to inspect the dike site. It was decided that the dike would start from Chengzi Temple in the north of Pei County to connect with the old site of Yutai, and extend east to Fangcun in the north of Tong County to be supported by the canal sluice gate. The length of the dike along the lake in Pei County reaches 100 li. Each district in the county has mobilized 60,000 laborers. Construction started today. All agencies in Pei County have been fully mobilized to supervise the work. The people of Pei County are mostly willing to volunteer because they are always concerned about being flooded along the lake. In addition to the full deployment of the Pei County Security Team, a squadron of the Xiao County Security Team has also been transferred to Pei County to assist in supervising the work and preventing bandits. Feng County Magistrate Wang Shuxian returned to Feng County to mobilize labor to assist in the construction after visiting Shao in Pei County. Tongshan County Magistrate Wang Gongjun is currently at Wuduanji on the lakeside to oversee the construction. The entire dike is expected to be completed in about fifteen days. Shao is currently staying in Pei County to supervise the work and has not yet returned to Xu Prefecture. Jiangsu Supervising Inspector Ding Chaowu arrived in Xu Prefecture this morning by Pingpu train. Zhou Xiaoxi, the secretary of the Commissioner's Office, and Pi Cheng, the chief of staff, visited him to report on the Yellow River flood prevention situation. Ding pointed out that Commissioner Shao is in Pei County, and Pei County is close to Weishan Lake, which is the focus of Yellow River flood prevention. He decided to take a car to Pei County tomorrow morning to meet Shao and inspect everything.</p>
<p>Xu埠 City Dike Repair: The city dike of Xu埠, that is, the west dike of the old Yellow River, surrounds the north, east, and south sides of the city, starting from Wolong Mountain in the north and reaching Jijui Dam in the south, about twelve li long, is the protection of the city埠. In recent years, water warnings have been frequent, and repairs have been made repeatedly, but there has been no specific consolidation. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic, the Yellow River breach in eastern Henan irrigated the old course, and fortunately, it turned north into the Dasha River and entered Weishan, and Xu埠 was spared from the disaster. At that time, the garrison troops assisted the laborers in repairing the dike, but it was not strong. This time, the county government, under the supervision of the first district office, directed the laborers, each 保 contributing 100 laborers. The entire dike was divided into eight sections for construction. Today, the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and the district office have all been fully mobilized to set off to mark the sections, apportion the laborers, and start construction tomorrow morning to complete the filling in one day. The base of the dike is very solid, and most of the dike body remains. However, there are many breaks, which have been repaired, and there is already a foundation. At present, it is easy to repair the remains.</p>
<p>The Situation of the New Dike in Lanfeng: Wang Picheng, the chief of staff of the Commissioner's Office, and representatives of various counties have returned to Xu Prefecture after visiting the Lanfeng Stone Dam. The dam is named Xiaoxin Dike and is located more than ten hours northeast of Lanfeng City. The dike is oriented northeast-southwest, connecting to the Dike of Cuizhuang in the north and to the highland of Zhangzhuang in the south, with a total length of 2,260 meters. The northern section is to repair the existing earth dike, and the southern section is the breach of the old dike, which was rebuilt into a water-receiving dam and built with gravel without pouring grout. It doesn't seem to be strong. The height of the dike is based on the water level at that location in the 22nd year of the Republic. A few days ago, when the Yellow River dike in Juancheng, Western Shandong, had not yet broken, the water level at that location exceeded the record of the 22nd year of the Republic. The Yellow River Commission hurried to build an earth dike on the dike to prevent overflow. When the river broke in Juancheng, the water level here dropped sharply. This year, Xu Prefecture was spared from water irrigation, which cannot be said to not be due to the strength of this dike. The Yellow River Commission believes that the river west of this dike is curved. The river comes from Kaifeng, curves southeast to the north of Lanfeng, then turns northwest, and then turns northeast to enter Shandong. This dike is on the southeast bank of the bend, so it is planned to partially open up a new channel so that the river can avoid the bend and go directly to the northeast to avoid siltation. It is still in the planning stage. Shen Baixian, the director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, has visited the dike and believes that the project is not strong enough. It is planned to connect two water diversion dams on the south bank of the river west of the dike to prevent the impact of the water flow. Construction may start soon. Jiangsu Province and Sichuan Province paid 70,000 for the construction of the dike, and Henan Province paid 30,000. According to the budget of the Yellow River Commission, including the two water diversion dams, 150,000 will be needed, and the remainder will be made up by the Yellow River Commission. The construction of this dike started on May 24 and is scheduled to be completed on August 2. There are still 400 workers repairing it every day.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Reinvestigation and Evaluation of House Tax</p>
<p>The house tax in Suzhou City is divided into two types: shop tax and household tax. The shop tax is levied at 10% of the monthly rent, and the household tax is 5%. During the investigation, the taxpayers often reported less than they should or the value was too large, making collection difficult. County Magistrate Wu is now organizing an evaluation committee to reorganize the tax, using the number of rooms as a standard, and calculating the rental value of self-occupied houses at one yuan. The committee is reinvestigating and evaluating the tax to ensure fairness. The task has now been completed, and starting from August 1, the tax will be levied uniformly according to the new tax rate.</p>
<p>Actively Dismantling Enclosures in Taihu Lake</p>
<p>The dismantling of enclosures in East Taihu Lake, under the command of the magistrates of Wujiang and Wu Counties and the deployment of the security teams under their jurisdiction, has been going on for a week. What remains now is only one group from the Kai Nan Company, 56 li long. On the 19th, it is expected that 6,000 villagers will be mobilized to dismantle it all in one day.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Sixty-Five People Suffer Heatstroke in Guangqin Factory</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, with the outdoor temperature reaching 103 degrees. Ordinary laborers are sweating like rain, and the indoor temperature is often between 97 and 98 degrees. As a result, there are daily reports of people suffering from heatstroke and dying on the road, and there are also many deaths from epidemic diseases. Hospitals inside and outside the city are extremely busy. The day before yesterday, as many as sixty-five female workers at the Guangqin Yarn Factory in Zhoushanbin suffered from heatstroke. Fortunately, they were treated quickly, and none of them are in danger of their lives. County Magistrate Wang Baoshan is not only preparing to set up an epidemic prevention hospital, but also advising the people to pay attention to public health to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>
<p>Children's Annual Meeting Working Groups</p>
<p>The Implementation Committee of the Children's Annual Meeting in the county also held its second meeting at the county government yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Shao Jingren.

(5) The Parent-Teacher Association or Parent Association to be established by this meeting in August should be handled by the Education Bureau and the Education Association.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Joint Operation of Suzhou-Changshu Shipping Companies</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Changshu highway is about to be open to automobile traffic, and shipping business will inevitably be shortened. Now, the various shipping companies on the Suzhou-Changshu route, such as China Merchants, Lao Gongmao, Huitong, Huimin, and Tongda, are aware that the road will be open soon. In order to maintain their business, they have decided to operate jointly. The methods are as follows: (1) Reduce the number of ship trips per day, with each company taking turns to operate, and share the profits and losses equally. (2) Reduce the current shipping prices. (3) Add a branch office and pier in Pingmen, Suzhou, to facilitate passengers taking trains and stocking goods. The houses have been negotiated and will be implemented starting from August 1.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the Drought Relief Committee</p>
<p>Due to the drought last year in Zhenjiang, local agencies and organizations organized a drought relief committee. More than 100,000 yuan was raised from donations and the collection of urban house tax. After paying for various disaster relief and work relief projects, there is still a surplus of more than 60,000 yuan. It is now planned to end all unfinished work projects and reorganize the committee into the Post-Drought Engineering Aftermath Committee of the 23rd Year of the Republic. Yan Huiyu, Lu Xiaobo, Yu Xiaochuan, Hu Bijang, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Zuoliang, Zhang Yiyun, Liu Jungu, Li Renzai, Cai Yunsun, Liu Jian, Zhu Zhishan, Yao Qisu, Yang Fangzhen, Xu Guosen, Bao Siqing, and Leng Yuqiu have been elected as the seventeen members.</p>
<p>Bank Erosion at Liuhe Port Again</p>
<p>The river bank at Liuhe Port on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang collapsed by several feet on the 21st of last month. People from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou had convened a meeting to protect the bank, but no concrete decision was made. In recent days, the river water has been flooding, and the situation on the north bank is more turbulent than usual. At about 4 p.m. on the 18th, cracks appeared on the ground of the automobile pier, which is a sign of continued collapse. The ferry did not dare to dock, and passengers had to transfer to the ferry at the inner harbor to take the ferry. In order to ensure the safety of passengers, the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Automobile Company decided to open a dock west of the pier and temporarily borrow a dredger from the Jiang River Engineering Office, which will start work immediately. In addition, it is currently the peak period of high tides, and low-lying areas along the river, such as the lotus pond and the Yidu pier, were flooded on the night of the 18th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>

The girl was still carrying an iron hoe. It was in an extremely miserable state. Also, a farmer named Chen Yazi, 26 years old, was struck and killed at home while taking a nap. 4. Two pigs raised by the Dong family in Zhu Dong Village were also struck and killed by lightning.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Labor Dispute at Hu Qing Yu Tang</p>
<p>The Hu Qing Yu Tang Chinese medicine store in Hangzhou City was founded by Hu Xueyan during the Xuncing era. Its annual business volume has reached millions and it is one of the most famous commercial firms. There are more than 200 partners and workers. In recent years, due to poor business, the shareholders have hired Yu Xiuzhang as manager and implemented austerity measures, which the workers are dissatisfied with. They unanimously rejected Yu and a dispute has broken out. On the evening of the 16th, Xu Zupei, a shareholder of the store, went to the store and was surrounded by partners who demanded that the manager be replaced. Xu firmly refused. The military police arrived and dispersed the crowd. The city government, after being reported, has ordered the City Chamber of Commerce to investigate and reply. The Chamber of Commerce has sent Pan Bianji to investigate the truth and then convened a standing committee meeting yesterday (19th) afternoon to find a way to mediate the dispute, urging both parties to make concessions. If mediation fails, the City Government will arbitrate.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: This Year's Water Conservancy Budget and Distribution Methods Determined; Flood Danger in the Yangtze River and Yellow River Has Passed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night train and went straight to his private residence on West Avenue Hames Road to rest. He also met with Fu Rulin and others. At noon, he went to the Central Processing Office for official business. Then, Song Ziwen visited him and talked for about half an hour before leaving. According to Kong, there were many water conservancy agencies in our country in the past, and things were not unified at the beginning. Therefore, last year the central government decided to establish a Water Conservancy Committee in the National Economic Commission to unify the various water conservancy agencies, such as the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the Huai River Conservancy Commission, and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, under its management. The Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission recommended me to be the director, and the chairmen of each association were the committee members. There was a meeting once before, and this was the second time. The things discussed at the meeting were (1) checking the progress of work after the first meeting, (2) passing this year's budget and distribution methods, and because the Yellow River and Yangtze River have recently been flooded, methods for treating the symptoms and root causes were also discussed. The details have been seen in the newspaper these days, and there is no need to repeat them. In recent years, the Yellow River has caused disasters, mostly in Hebei and Henan provinces. In Shandong Province, Chairman Han of the province has been working hard to prevent floods, so there has been no disaster. Unfortunately, there were several breaches this time, which was unexpected. However, according to repeated reports from Shandong, it is working hard to rescue and protect them, and it will not be difficult to quickly pacify the situation. Regarding disaster relief, the central government and local areas are closely related, and we should do our best to assist them. We especially hope that local areas will cooperate to save the people on both sides. Now the authorities in Hebei and Henan are also working very hard, and the Yellow River disaster should not fall into a serious situation. As for the Yangtze River flood, according to the recent reports in Wuhan, the danger period has passed.</p>
<h3>Fu Rulin Said: The Water Level of the Yangtze River is Gradually Receding, and the Danger Period Has Passed</h3>
<p>Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by night train. Then, at about 9:30 a.m., he visited Minister of Finance Kong to make a request. According to Fu, the water level of the Yangtze River has gradually receded in recent days, and the danger period has passed, so there should be no problem. As for the fundamental methods of disaster prevention, the National Water Conservancy Conference has already made a decision. The Yellow River is not within my jurisdiction, and I will not inspect it.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, went to Beijing some days ago to report to the central government on the municipal administration of Shanghai. He finished his official duties the night before last and took a night train from Beijing back to Shanghai. At 7:10 a.m. yesterday morning, he got off the train in Zhenru and went straight to his private residence on Haig Road to rest. Then, at about 10:00 a.m., he went to the municipal government to handle official business.</p>
<h3>The Constitution of the Loan Committee Approved by the Ministry of Finance; the Bankers Association Notified to Prepare Funds for Allocation</h3>
<p>New Sound Agency said, the Ministry of Finance allocated 20 million national treasury certificates and the third meeting decided to ask Cai Zengji, Chairman of (1) Guarantee Loan Outline, (2) Rules of Organization of that Committee, (3) Rules of Procedure of that Committee, (4) Guarantee Loan Detailed Rules, to submit for approval from the Ministry of Finance. Now it has received the approval from the Ministry.</p>
<p>Loan Committee Discusses Implementation</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency believes that, after inquiring to the Loan Committee yesterday, among the Guaranteed Loan Regulations approved by the Ministry of Finance, the provisions had been revised a lot. The Chairman and members of the Committee, Cai Zengji, has instructed the office to print copies and decided to convene another plenary meeting of the Committee next Monday and Tuesday to discuss the implementation. It is reported that of the 20 million loans, 5 million will be used for credit loans and 15 million will be used for mortgage loans. As for the implementation date, it will be determined at the next plenary meeting of the Committee.</p>
<p>Member Banks Collect Millions</p>
<p>National News Agency said, the Shanghai Banking Industry Association, based on the resolution of the 71st Executive Committee, will increase the actual number of 510,000 yuan of credit loan guarantees from member banks by a factor of two, for a total of 1 million yuan, and submit a list to the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee for reference. It is heard that the Loan Review Committee plans to convene the sixth meeting today to discuss further implementation of the loan.</p>
<h3>This Year, the Epidemic Will Not Spread; No True Cholera Has Been Found</h3>
<p>Central News Agency said, in recent days, the weather has been extremely hot, leading to an increase in epidemic diseases. In addition to vaccinations, the local health authorities and hospitals in the city have been stepping up their work these days. Yesterday morning, the weather was still rather sultry, and by 2 p.m., dark clouds filled the sky, with thunder booming, followed by wind and rain that stopped after about half an hour. The sky was still clear, but the heat had decreased. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Health Bureau, this year's epidemic is greatly reduced compared to previous years. Although the heat has increased in the past few days, there is no discovery of acute epidemic diseases such as true cholera. Now there are occasional showers and winds to adjust the climate, so it is expected that there will be no spread of epidemic diseases.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Health Authorities' Opinion on Cholera</h3>
<p>The previous day, various newspapers published reports that true cholera had been discovered in this port. After a detailed investigation by the health authorities of this port, such as the Municipal Government Health Bureau, the Public Concession Health Office, and the Harbor Quarantine Administration, it was learned that this was a misunderstanding that caused unnecessary alarm. Furthermore, according to a conversation with an important official of the Public Concession Health Office, the dissemination of this news is a very serious matter, not only causing unnecessary panic among the people of this port, but also, if transmitted overseas by telegraph, it could easily affect the arrival and departure of ships, causing great losses to commerce. Therefore, it is hoped that all epidemic hospitals, each of which has knowledgeable doctors in charge of diagnosis and treatment, should be more cautious in their conversations with journalists in the future. Furthermore, all news agencies and newspaper reporters, when encountering such news, must verify it from responsible parties in multiple places before disclosing it, so as not to cause misunderstandings again.</p>
<h3>Customs, Salt, and Stamp Tax Affairs: Three Administrations Jointly Combat Smuggling; Office Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to strengthen the force of combating smuggling in salt and stamp tax affairs and to save smuggling expenses, the Ministry of Finance ordered the three administrations of Customs, Tax, and Salt Affairs to discuss methods and jointly form a joint anti-smuggling office. The three agencies, upon receiving the order, convened a meeting a few days ago, with key officials from the Ministry of Finance also present. They jointly discussed the organizational rules and regulations of the joint anti-smuggling office and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance. After Finance Minister Kong approves it, it will be implemented in the shortest possible time. The office will be established in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Emphasizes Foreign Trade; South America and Bombay Need Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has always paid close attention to foreign trade. Whenever foreign merchants entrust it with investigating domestic goods, it informs them in detail. Yesterday, the Chamber received requests from Huang Linhu, Consul General of Guatemala City, South America, and Mr. Li Bosi of that city, to investigate the following commodities: 1. Cloth, bleached or unbleached; 2. Woolen or bovine hair fabrics for men's wear; 3. Artificial woolen fabrics; 4. Bedding and tablecloths; 5. Handkerchiefs and silk scarves (natural silk and rayon); 6. Raincoats and rubber heels; 7. Umbrellas and hats; 8. Textile threads or clews made with the Macclesfield method; 9. Porcelain. It also received a request from the Bombay Hatchid Company to investigate exporters of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and other commodities. Domestic manufacturers who wish to engage in export trade of the above commodities can contact the Commercial Section of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge for introductions.</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase in the Extra-Settlement Road Area; The Municipal Bureau of Public Works Informs the Telephone Company to Correct, the Approval of the Shanghai Municipal Government Must Be Obtained First</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's telephone price increase, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works sent a letter to the company stating that sovereignty over the area of the Extra-Settlement Roads in the west and north of Shanghai belongs to the Municipal Government. If the company wishes to increase the price of telephones installed in that area, it must first obtain the permission of the Municipal Government; otherwise, the telephone prices for users in that area must not be increased. Details have been published in various newspapers. It has now been learned that the Shanghai Telephone Company replied, saying that the company's telephone prices are based on the contract signed between the company and the two Concession Public Works Bureaus. It cannot comply with the point that the approval of the Shanghai Municipal Government should be requested for telephone prices in the Extra-Settlement Road area. However, the Bureau of Public Works has sent another letter to the company for correction, stating that the right of the company to install, maintain, and operate telephones in the Extra-Settlement Road area in the west and north of Shanghai is obtained according to the temporary telephone contract signed between the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the company. There is no doubt that the sovereignty of allowing the company to operate in that area belongs to the Municipal Government. As for the contract signed between the company and the two Concession Public Works Bureaus, it cannot be applied to the Extra-Settlement Road area where sovereignty belongs to the Municipal Government. The reason is even more obvious. Now, the company has not requested permission from the Municipal Government for the telephone price increase in that area, which is indeed inappropriate, and the Bureau of Public Works should correct it. If the company's failure to make corrections obstructs the convenience of telephone users in that area, the company should bear the responsibility.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of the Municipal Federation Suggests Rent Reduction Principles; Collecting Rent at 60% Discount and Abolishing the Package Rent System Proposed for Discussion at the Standing Committee Meeting on the 22nd</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Chen Jiufeng and others, executive committee members of the First Special District Municipal Federation, believe that the market is depressed, and most landlords are only thinking of their own private interests and failing to reduce rent, which is a major expense for residents. Therefore, they suggest four principles for rent reduction. The original text states: (1) During this emergency, request the government to order a 60% rent collection discount (if rent has already been reduced after January 28, but not to 60%, it should be adjusted to 60%); (2) Request the central government to stipulate that the statutory interest rate for the use of real estate should not exceed 5%; (3) According to Article 442 of the Civil Code, the judicial and administrative authorities should be requested to cooperate and issue a clear order to reduce rent; (4) Prohibit the use of real estate as a speculative business and abolish the package rent system. The Municipal Federation has decided to discuss and implement this proposal at the standing committee meeting on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Hongxin Qingying Steamer Encountered Robbery in Zhangze Port; Losses Exceeding One Thousand Yuan, One Passenger Injured; Qingji Company Submits Request to Arrest Robbers and Recover Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Pinghu line's Xinqingying steamer of the Qingji Steamship Company was robbed in Zhangze Port the day before yesterday morning, and a passenger named Wu Afu was injured. The total loss was more than one thousand yuan. The company has submitted a request for strict arrest. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Robbery: The Xinqingying steamer departed from the Tianhou Palace Bridge pier in Shanghai at 4:00 PM on July 17th, towing five boats, two loaded with goods and about 20 passengers, and three empty. At about 1:00 AM on the 18th, when the boat reached Zhangze Port, Songjiang County, 12 li from Tuolai Temple, a pirate boat suddenly appeared with eight pirates. First, they fired two shots, and the boat boss, Tang Anan, immediately went full speed ahead, trying to avoid them. At that time, the pirates jumped onto the towed boats, forced the boat bosses, and began to rob. None of the passengers escaped. They left on the pirate boat at 2:30 AM.</p>
<p>Total Losses: After the incident, the losses were checked: Fengji and others, 591 yuan; Guo Xiaoji, 55 yuan; Lv Hengchang, 106 yuan; Yongchang, 128 yuan; Wang Shiqing, 10 yuan; water toll, etc., collected by the boat, more than 200 yuan; towed boat, 15 yuan, totaling more than 1,100 yuan. In addition, more than 2,000 pieces of short shirts and pants of the passengers were taken. Most of the passengers on the boat were watermelon merchants from Southern, and the purpose of the robbery was for this. Fortunately, the goods loaded were not robbed. When the robbery occurred, the watermelon merchant Wu Afu was injured in the head and back with a bayonet, but fortunately, his life was not in danger.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: After the robbery, boat boss Tang Anan sailed to Pinghu as usual. After passing Tuolai Temple, he reported to the Water Police Bureau. After arriving in Pinghu at 10:00 AM on the 18th, the company reported to the Pinghu County Government. In the afternoon of the same day, he sailed from Pinghu to Shanghai as usual according to the schedule. He arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 19th. Boat boss Tang Anan reported the robbery to the Shanghai company. The boat has decided to sail as usual according to the schedule. The injured passenger has been admitted to the hospital for treatment after arriving in Pinghu.</p>
<p>Request to Arrest the Robbers: The Qingji Company wrote to the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Trade Association: "Respectfully, our company's Xinqingji small steamer, at 4 o'clock on July 17th, towed five boats and sailed from Shanghai to Pinghu. At 1 o'clock that night, at Zhanggang Port, Songjiang County, a pirate boat came and fired two shots, ordering the boat to stop. The pirates jumped onto the towed boats, dressed in blue cloth military uniforms, with cloth wrapped around their heads, leggings on their feet, disguised with painted faces, speaking a mixture of dialects, holding bayonets and iron mallets, etc. The pirates boarded the boat and robbed the water tolls and foreign money in the wheelhouse, searched passengers for foreign money, shirts, pants, etc., without exception. They stopped after 2 o'clock. The pirates also ordered the boat and towed boat to go west first, to Tuolai Temple, and immediately reported to the Water Police Bureau. Upon arriving at Pinghu, they reported to the Pinghu County Government. For this reason, we respectfully request your association to send a letter to the Songjiang County Government, as well as the adjacent Jinshan County Government, and the Water Police Bureau of Tuolai Temple, to strictly arrest them, and quickly recover the stolen goods to reassure passengers and maintain navigation. It is for the public good."</p>
<h3>96-Year-Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo Urges National Austerity to Rescue Disaster Victims; Hoping Readers of This Book Will Rise Up United</h3>
<p>Ninety-six-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo published a book urging national austerity to rescue flood victims, saying: "Fellow countrymen, the terror of the flood has been described in detail in the newspapers. Now, the bays and levees have become a watery country, and Yisha looks like Tingzhou. More than 60 counties in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces are affected by the disaster. Wuhan, bearing the brunt of the Yangtze River's discharge, is in an even more precarious situation. In the north, the Yellow River has not only submerged Yanshi, but also breached its banks in Juancheng. Yuncheng, Juye, Dongping, Heze, Shouyang, Jiaxiang, Jining, Wenshang and other counties in western Shandong are also disaster areas. Looking across the country, floods cover the sky, and mourning wails fill the land. What is more heartbreaking than today? I am nearly a hundred years old and have seen the tragedy of floods twice before. I remember in the 23rd year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, the floods flooded my home. In panic, I climbed the stairs and boarded a boat, barely escaping with my life. At that time, streets and alleys were submerged as canals, and the fields were reduced to rivers and seas. Villagers went to the water and dispersed, their miserable cries shaking the heavens and the earth. Although I survived, when I think back to the situation at that time, I am still sad. The second time was in the 20th year of the Republic of China. At that time, with my experience of the vicissitudes of life, I worked with my friends to awaken the national public to pay attention to the disaster relief work, and I also elaborated on the final proposal to be adopted by those in charge of the disaster victims. Unexpectedly, only four years have passed, and another unprecedented disaster has occurred. The economy of our country's rural areas has been greatly damaged since the great flood of the 20th year. For years, the world has been uneasy, and it has been hit by natural disasters again. Those who survive the disaster are in a dilemma of life and death. How can they be expected to fight for the country's difficulties? The government has repeatedly discussed flood control strategies for the flood disaster, and has also discussed specific measures for the disaster relief problem. However, I believe that the government should take the lead in disaster relief, and the people must rise up below. If the government and the public can be consistent and work together, the result will be twice as effective, and the natural disaster can be saved immediately. Therefore, I very much hope that people across the country will rise up to plan it together. So, how can we help the current flood disaster? It is said that the people of the whole country should work together on the thrift campaign. The so-called thrift is to save their own food, clothing, housing and transportation in order to donate to emergency relief. Those who wear silk and Shu brocade should think of the disaster victims who are naked and bare. Those who drink fragrant and eat fatty foods should think of the disaster victims who gnaw tree bark and chew grass roots. Those who live in high halls and large buildings should think of the disaster victims who nest on the treetops and dig soil hills. Those who ride swift horses and drive inlaid carts should think of the disaster victims who sink in the flood and float on the waves. Then, the heart of compassion moves in the middle, saving the waste of food, clothing, housing and transportation in order to help the disaster victims. It can be said to be an "obligation" to reduce our unnecessary material enjoyment and save the lives of countless disaster victims. I know that the people of the country will be happy to follow. Or, donating goods for disaster relief is a passive work and not a fundamental strategy. Moreover, repeated disasters and repeated donations will not make people tired. It is said, what is it said? It is important to devote oneself to active work and to construct science. This is the regular work of the government, and disaster relief is our obligation. What's more, thousands of disaster victims are floating in the flood, looking up to the sky, enduring death and waiting for help. Now, saving our unnecessary consumption to save the disaster victims who are waiting to die, a penny of donation and a material of help are beneficial to the disaster victims, and we have never wasted it. Saving one more person is saving one more life. How can it be said that it is not active? As for repeated donations, or causing boredom, making people benevolent, it will not be like this. Donating funds for disaster relief is the first happy thing. Is there anyone in the world who is tired of doing good? And if we were to change places and be in the same situation, we would also eagerly hope that others would come to help us? In short, empty talk of relief, but adding pity, is of no help. It is valuable to secretly save on clothing, and generously donate to actual relief. And there is a clear instruction in ancient times that things and people are citizens. If there are hungry people in the wild and I am the only one who eats my fill, and everyone is sleeping outdoors and I am the only one who is resting in the swallows, do I feel at ease when I touch my conscience? If you can bear to hear it, then the disaster victims will not be saved, and the loss of the entire country is also a self-help in the future. My dear fellow countrymen, do you want to save people to save yourself, or do you want to abandon people to abandon yourself? I hope that you will choose for yourself. I am ninety-six years old this year, and I cannot bear to sit back and watch the disaster victims wait for death, and the invisible decline of the country's lifeline. Therefore, I would like to present the proposal of saving the flood disaster by austerity to the people of the country. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will appreciate my analogy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Inspects Exported Hemp; Implemented Today</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously stated that my country's hemp production is abundant, with annual exports of more than 350,000 piculs, accounting for an important position in my country's exports. In recent years, various countries have seen an increasing need for this raw material, which is a good opportunity to develop foreign trade. However, the quality of exported hemp is not pure, and the grades are uneven. In order to promote improvement, it is necessary to implement inspection. The bureau then ordered the Hankou and Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureaus to open hemp export inspections one after another. After the implementation of the Hankou Bureau, it has gradually become effective. The Shanghai Bureau is now ready, and it is scheduled to be implemented today (the 20th). All hemp exported from Shanghai must not be declared for export without passing the inspection. The bureau has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking it to inform the relevant industries, and published a notice in the newspaper to inform the public. On the one hand, it has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to request the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Jianghai Customs to assist in the handling.</p>
<h3>China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Issued a Declaration…Elected Executive Supervisors</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association was initiated and organized by colleagues in the national goods cigarette industry, the tobacco industry, and the color printing industry, as well as enthusiastic people from the society. After considerable formalities, the inaugural meeting was held at the Ningbo Road Hotel yesterday afternoon. More than 80 members of the association attended. Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were sent to participate in the guidance. The meeting was opened at 2:30 with a half-shake of the bell. Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yansong, Shen Weiting, Ding Zhenbo, and Shen Xuewen were elected as the chairmen of the meeting. After performing the etiquette as usual, the chairman delivered a speech, and the representatives of the Party Headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce gave instructions. The declaration and the charter were passed, and the executive supervisors were elected. Tea and snacks were served. It is said that the elected committees and supervisors are scheduled to perform the collective duty ceremony next Tuesday. The details of each item are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Shen Weiting reported that the Chinese merchant cigarette industry has been in danger in recent years. Since February this year, it has felt even worse. Unemployment of workers has also increased daily. If we do not seek market relief quickly, the consequences are unimaginable. Moreover, due to the decline of the cigarette business, the tobacco industry and the color printing industry have also been greatly affected. Therefore, in May of this year, colleagues from the three industries began to prepare to establish this association and were joined by celebrities from all walks of life to seek remedy. Later, the officials of the Party Headquarters appreciated the commercial situation and also believed that it was necessary to establish this association, and issued a permit. It was only established today. Chairman Wang Yansong said, roughly, that promoting national goods is the most urgent task today. However, from the perspective of the factory, research must be carried out on the products, and efforts must be made to improve the organization. The content must be rigorous, and the cost should be reduced. From the perspective of the people, promoting national goods is the duty of the people. Not only national goods cigarettes should be maintained, but any national products should be jointly promoted and happily purchased. As far as the entire national goods industry is concerned, no matter which national goods industry, it should first contact and promote each other. If only the interests of the industry are considered and other industries are ignored, then promotion and maintenance cannot be said to be thorough. I hope that the cigarette factory industry can pay attention to this. Chairman Yuan Ludeng said, roughly, that the Chinese merchant cigarette factory industry is now at a critical moment of survival. It is necessary to maintain and remedy it. We should carefully explore the future plans, especially strive to unite and strive to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>Representative's Instructions: Zhao Yuchang, representative of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, and Yuan Hongjun, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each gave instructions, roughly saying that the maintenance association has a major mission, and should unite and strive to rise up to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>General Assembly Declaration: In recent years, the need for cigarettes has become increasingly large, the sales area has expanded, and the overflow of interests has also increased. However, the world mostly ignores it and is careless. This can be a hidden worry. Our country's cigarette business has always been monopolized by foreign merchants. Now, although there are dozens of Chinese merchant cigarette factories, most of them have weak capital and simple equipment. Even if the full power of Chinese factories is used, it is still worried that they cannot compete with foreign factories. Recently, due to the economic depression of society and the price competition of foreign cigarettes, the business of Chinese factories has fallen sharply. Several factories have announced their closure. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are reducing and stopping work, which is often heard. It is difficult to support and panic. It is dying and cannot live a day. The livelihood of millions of workers is also shaken. If we do not seek remedies urgently, then the great disaster in the coming days will be flourishing, and the momentum will collapse completely, and there will be no more to eat. Thinking of this, I shudder. The colleagues of this association believe that the rise and fall of Chinese factories is related to the people's livelihood. It is unbearable to stand idly by in such difficult times. However, rather than burning our heads, it is better to bend the chimney to move the firewood. The policy of remedy is not just one end, and publicity and maintenance are the key. Therefore, I am not presumptuous and launched the China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association. I hope that we can expand the publicity and maintain each other. If the goals are the same and the response is like a response, the effect will be seen in a few months. The result is twice as effective. There is no more than this. However, this matter is of great importance, and there are many details. It really depends on the wisdom and efforts of the group to achieve success. I hope that the contemporary heroes and patriotic people will participate and bear the heavy responsibility together, so that the future of national goods will open a line of dawn and gradually move towards a bright and splendid field. The benefit of national goods is not only the cigarette factory industry. I hereby express my words, I hope you will understand.</p>

<h3>Japanese Envoy to Australia Ambassador Izubuchi Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Daily News, Izubuchi, the Japanese-Australian goodwill envoy and former ambassador to the United States, along with Commercial Secretary Sudo and Foreign Affairs Secretary Toyota, passed through Shanghai on the Wilson Wheel at 6:00 AM on the 19th, and went to Dutch India, New Zealand, and the Philippines for visits. Izubuchi made the following remarks to Japanese reporters: "Japan is the third largest supplier of raw materials for the fiber industry to Australia. Its wool production reaches 100 million yuan annually and is imported into Japan. Due to the trade relations between the two countries, it is necessary to have a reasonable solution to the problems of import control and tariffs from the overall situation."</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Maoli No. 2 Shipwreck is Unknown; The Maritime Administration Investigates and Questions; Laixiang Firm Sends Personnel to Salvage</h3>
<p>Regarding the sinking of the Maoli No. 2 ship of the Maoli Steamship Company in Shanghai at the Dinghai Wharf, the Shanghai Maritime Administration reported that it sent personnel to investigate and summoned the crew for questioning. However, the true cause of the accident will not be clear until the ship is salvaged. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inconsistent Statements on the Cause of the Accident</p>
<p>After the Maoli Company's Maoli No. 2 ship sank at the Dinghai Wharf at 4:03 PM on the 12th of this month, the Shanghai Maritime Administration reported it on the 13th and immediately sent personnel to investigate. It also ordered the Maoli Company to report the details quickly and handle the aftermath. On the one hand, it reported to the Ministry of Communications. Yesterday, the bureau summoned the owner of the Maoli No. 2 ship, Xu Yousheng, the chief mate, Zhang Yongtang, the chief engineer, Fang Lincai (the old engineer), the chief machinist, Lu Shunlan (the second engineer), and the second machinist, Chen Jifa (the third engineer), to inquire about the circumstances of the disaster. According to the crew members of the driving part, most of the crew members of the engine room were novices, and the use of machinery was not appropriate, resulting in water entering the engine room. According to the crew members of the engine room, the crew members of the driving part loaded the cargo unevenly, resulting in a difference in the draft of more than five feet. When berthing at the wharf, the stern rope was too tight, and the stern door was too close to the water. At 4:30, it was high tide, causing the stern door (which was not closed in the morning for passengers and goods) to suddenly let in water, resulting in the sinking of the ship. The statements of both parties were different, and they shirked each other's responsibilities. The truth is still difficult to know for a while. It may be clear after the ship is salvaged and thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>Hiring Water Ghosts to Engage in Salvage</p>
<p>According to personnel of the Maoli Company, the goods on the ship have been taken up by hired water ghosts, and salvage is now underway. The ship was originally named Eumeralla Lloydclassal and was purchased from Australia. It sailed from the ocean to Shanghai for more than a month and was very stable. This time, after detailed inspection by the Maritime Administration and the insurance company's ship surveyors, it was deemed qualified, and the ship's repairs were completed. It sailed at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month. The ship's hull was quite stable, and the speed was also good. After sailing across the ocean, it safely arrived in Putuo. After sailing to Dinghai and berthing, it took only one hour and fifteen minutes before this disaster occurred, which was unexpected, or there may be other reasons, unrelated to the ship's stability. The reports in a certain newspaper on the 19th and a certain evening newspaper on the 18th are not consistent with the facts. It seems that the news was spread by other parties with other purposes.</p>
<p>Laixiang Foreign Firm Undertakes Salvage</p>
<p>After the Maoli No. 2 ship of the Maoli Shipping Bureau had an accident in Dinghai, Xu Zufan was sent to Dinghai by the China Ship Insurance Federation to inspect and report back to Shanghai. The Ship Insurance Federation has decided to carry out salvage. It is said that the goods in the ship have been salvaged one after another. Yesterday, our reporter met with Mr. Tang Danhua, director of the China Ship Insurance Federation, and asked about the progress of the ship's salvage project. He said that the salvage project was put out to public tender, and the British firm Laixiang won the bid. Both parties have agreed on the salvage method yesterday. The foreign firm will send engineers carrying boat-salvaging equipment and workers to Dinghai on the Dahua ship to carry out salvage work.</p>
<h3>Exceeded the Prediction of the Huangpu River Bureau: Yesterday Morning's High Tide in the Huangpu River, Less Than One Foot from the Riverbank, Causing Waterlogging in Low-Lying Roads Due to Backflow</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning's high tide in the Huangpu River reached a level of twelve feet one inch, exceeding the prediction by four inches. It was less than one foot from the Bund's riverbank. Fortunately, the tide did not overflow the bank, but low-lying roads were already waterlogged. A reporter from Datong News Agency investigated and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Tide Higher Than Predicted</p>
<p>Yesterday morning's high tide reached its peak at 2:35 AM, thirty minutes later than the 2:05 AM predicted by the Huangpu River Bureau. The level reached twelve feet one inch, also four inches higher than predicted. The tide began to recede at 5:13 AM and completely receded by 11:20 AM.</p>
<p>Less Than One Foot From the Riverbank</p>
<p>Yesterday morning's high tide was one of the highest in the Huangpu River in the past seven months. It came within only nine inches of the Bund's riverbank. The current was surging, and it was a close call that it did not overflow the riverbank. Especially in areas such as the Bund Park, where the embankment is less than thirteen feet high, the situation was particularly precarious as it was threatened by the tide.</p>
<p>Waterlogging in Low-Lying Roads</p>
<p>Low-lying roads in this city, such as Sichuan Road, Hankou Road, and the Bund, were repeatedly flooded by tidal water backing up from the sewers last year, turning them into a watery land. Therefore, the Public Works Department raised them in January of this year. However, Zhejiang Road (south of Nanjing Road) in front of the Yong'an Tianyunlou building, and the intersection of Gansu Road and Rue Albert, have not been raised. Therefore, there was waterlogging in these areas yesterday morning. Moreover, since it was in the middle of the night, it is feared that there were more low-lying roads with backflow flooding.</p>
<p>Reasons for Exceeding the Prediction</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, when the Water Conservancy Section of the Huangpu River Bureau was asked about the reasons for the tide exceeding the prediction, it was learned that it was due to (1) the Yangtze River's water level being relatively high to begin with, (2) the weather not being as clear and bright as in the previous few days, and (3) a slight southeast wind. The combination of these three factors, although individually weak, still had a minor impact. Furthermore, the highest tide level the day before yesterday afternoon was only ten feet three and two-tenths inches, not twelve feet.</p>
<p>August Tide Prediction</p>
<p>The Huangpu River Bureau announced yesterday the tide predictions for August of this year: From the 1st to the 3rd, high tide will be 10.56 feet, low tide 3.05 feet; from the 4th to the 10th, high tide will be 9.80 feet, low tide 5.56 feet; from the 11th to the 17th, high tide will be 12.02 feet, low tide 4.18 feet; from the 18th to the 24th, high tide will be 11.32 feet, low tide 5.05 feet; from the 25th to the 31st, high tide will be 11.45 feet, low tide 4.50 feet.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Bureau Officially Begins Dredging the Shentan Sandbar: Work Limited to Daylight Hours</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's "Construction" dredger, after arriving in Shanghai, immediately sailed to Shentan Sandbar (also known as Tongsha Baisha) for trial dredging. It is now learned that dredging has officially begun. The trial dredging signal on the ship has been removed and replaced with the international code flag AHF, meaning "This vessel is engaged in dredging." The work is limited to daylight hours.</p>

<h3>Finn, Mr. Karsikko, Arrives in Shanghai on a Round-the-World Trip; Will Proceed to Central China Within Days</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Karsikko, a 28-year-old Finn, departed from Helsinki, the capital of Finland, on a round-the-world trip. After four years of travel, he has arrived in Shanghai. He expects to need approximately two more years to complete his journey. Mr. Karsikko is a leader of the Finnish Boy Scouts. He started his journey in February 1931, passing through Poland, Danzig, Germany, France, Palestine, Egypt, India, Burma, the Straits Settlements, Siam, Vietnam, and the Chinese provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Fujian. He told a reporter from the Continental Daily that he walked approximately half the distance, traveling a maximum of 30 miles per day. He now plans to go to Central China, Northeast China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, India, Australia, South America, North America, and then cross the Atlantic Ocean, pass through England, and return to his home country. His travel expenses come from selling postcards and giving lectures, and sometimes he receives subsidies from local Boy Scout troops. His luggage is very simple. In addition to daily necessities, he only carries a camera and a diary, which he will later organize and write into a book. Mr. Karsikko will set off for Central China within days.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jishan Accused of Attempting to Murder His Wife: Trial Concluded Yesterday, Verdict to Be Announced on the 25th; Wife Testifies That the Murder Was Planned</h3>
<p>Zhao Jishan, a 32-year-old traditional Chinese medicine doctor from Zhenjiang, resides at 71 Xin Kang Lane, Connaught Road. He practices medicine at Guangyi Hospital, 117 Rue Robert. Seven years ago, he married Ms. Leng (34 years old this year), also from Zhenjiang. They have no children. In the 19th year of the Republic (1930), Zhao took Zhong Jindi (25 years old this year), a cousin of his sister-in-law and also from Zhenjiang, as a concubine. They have one son and one daughter, the daughter being 5 years old and the son 3 years old. The wife and concubine have lived together in Shanghai for three years. The two women occasionally argued, and Zhao would mediate. At 3 PM on the 4th of this month, Zhao and his wife, Ms. Leng, went to the Great World amusement park. At around 7 PM in the evening, the two went to the rooftop platform on the fifth floor, near the Edward Road and the Gong Wu Tai theater, to cool off. They were chatting and laughing happily. Then, Zhao said to Ms. Leng, "Let's hug each other to test each other's weight." She believed him and first reached out to hug Zhao. After putting him down, Zhao picked her up. Unexpectedly, he threw and pushed her violently over the railing. Fortunately,</p>
<p>at the critical moment, she grabbed the railing with both hands and shouted for help loudly. At that time, there were few visitors in that area. The tea server, Zhu Jinfu, heard the shouting and rushed to rescue her. He sent Zhao and his wife to the cashier's office and ordered the doorman to arrest them and send them to the French police station. The next day, they were sent to the Special No. 2 Court and prosecuted for attempted murder. The case was accepted and investigated. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. After the incident, Zhao's concubine, Zhong Jindi, moved all the furniture and belongings</p>
<p>and disappeared without a trace the next day. Yesterday morning at 9 AM, Judge Li Changnian and Clerk Wang Baoxun of the Special No. 2 Court continued the trial in the Criminal Court No. 1. Defendant Zhao Jishan was brought before the court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the police's investigation and prosecuted Zhao for attempted murder under Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. The official questioned the complainant, Leng Zhao, who stated that she</p>
<p>had been married to Zhao for eight years without having children. Usually, her husband treats his concubine better than her. They lived together. On the morning of the 5th, when she returned home from the police station, the concubine had moved all the furniture and clothes away. Later, she heard people say that the concubine instigated her husband to murder her, and he had tried to harm her several times. That day, when they went to the Great World, the concubine was playing cards at a neighbor's house. Her husband told her to keep it a secret from the concubine. Later, on the roof of the Great World, her husband picked her up, put her on the railing, and then used his hands to push her</p>
<p>hard in the chest. She fell down but managed to grab the railing and shout for help. The tea server came to rescue her. Her husband did not pull her up to save her. When questioned, Zhao Jishan stated that the concubine existed, and they had some arguments. He tried to appease both sides. This time, because his wife wanted to return to her hometown, he took time to accompany her to the Great World. They went to the roof together. He picked her up and sat her on the railing. She accidentally slipped off, and he grabbed her. The official asked Ms. Leng whether the defendant grabbed her. She</p>
<p>shook her head to deny it. Witness Zhu Jinfu testified that when he went to rescue her, she was holding onto the railing, and the railing had been pulled broken. At that time, Zhao was standing far away. The official then asked Zhao whether he knew where the concubine had fled to. He replied that he did not know and suspected she had gone back to her parents' home. He also asked Ms. Leng who told her that the concubine had instigated the murder and who saw the concubine moving things away. She initially refused to say, claiming she did not want</p>
<p>to implicate others. After being persuaded by the judge, she said that her sister-in-law, who lived on Hengfeng Road and was the concubine's older sister, told her. And a tenant in the house saw the concubine moving things away. The official then ordered the investigating officer in charge of the case, Ma Yizhi, to quickly accompany the complainant, Zhao Leng, to summon the tenant to the court for questioning. At 11 o'clock, Judge Li</p>
<p>resumed the trial and questioned the tenant, Xia Wang, a woman from Fenghua. She testified that the wife and concubine had argued once in March of this year. The wife lived in the attic upstairs, and the concubine lived behind the guest room. Initially, they ate at the same table, but later they cooked separately. She rarely spoke to them on weekdays. On the afternoon of the 4th, the wife went out, and she did not know that she had gone to the Great World. At this point in the questioning, the court considered the facts to be clear and ordered the start of the debate, then announced the conclusion and scheduled the verdict for 8 AM on the 25th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>A Life Lost Over a Cup of Shaved Ice: Xu the Monk Injured in a Beating for Not Having Money, Dies Tragically the Next Day; Court Orders Autopsy</h3>
<p>Xu the Monk, a 44-year-old local resident, lived at 8 Lane 310, Tangshan Road. He worked as a watermelon vendor. On the morning of the 17th, at around 8 AM, he went to the Tongzhou Road vegetable market to buy vegetables and return home. Passing by the entrance of the Fuxingguan porridge shop at 643 Dongyouheng Road, he was extremely thirsty due to the hot weather. He ordered a cup of cold shaved ice for six copper coins from Lu Axiao, a 22-year-old shaved ice vendor from Nanxiang. After finishing the drink, he intended to leave without paying. Lu Axiao immediately stopped him and demanded payment. They</p>
<p>fought each other. As a result, Xu the Monk was defeated and fell to the ground. After being persuaded by others, Xu returned home. He felt a slight pain in his left chest and told his wife, Ms. Zhang. He also told his friend Zhang Ahui at 65 Longqing Lane, Dongxihuade Road, about the incident. Zhang hurried to negotiate with Lu Axiao, telling him not to injure Xu. Lu took out three small silver coins, ten copper coins, and gave them to Liu Changlin, a shop assistant, to buy medicine and give it to Xu for his injuries. The matter was settled. The next morning at 4 AM, Xu went to the Nanshi Market as usual to buy watermelons for sale. At around 8 AM, he felt unwell again at home and went to bed at 10 AM. At 1 PM in the afternoon, he suddenly died. His wife, Ms. Zhang,</p>
<p>cried loudly and rushed to the nearby sentry station on Dongyouheng Road to report the incident to the Chinese police. They arrested Lu (who lived in the restaurant every night, and the ice stall was also attached to it) and took him to the Jiaxing Road police station. Police Chief Jin Yangwu sent a Chinese detective to investigate. Xu the Monk was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but died. The body was taken to the autopsy station on Fielun Road. The suspect, Lu, was taken to the First Special District Court yesterday. Public Works Department lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the events and requested detention. Judge Jiang Shuzi briefly questioned the defendant and ordered detention pending autopsy. At 11 AM, court-appointed prosecutor Guo Wei arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to Liu Changlin, an employee of Fuxingguan, "At that time, they were fighting outside. I did not witness it. I ran out to mediate a moment later, and Xu had already fallen to the ground." When questioned, Lu Axiao claimed that the deceased started the fight first, grabbing his clothes. He lightly lifted his hand, and the deceased fell to the ground. He provided evasive answers. Mr. Guo ordered that the case be autopsied and rescheduled the hearing for next Monday. After the autopsy, the body was handed over to Xu's wife, Xu Zhang, to take back after signing a pledge.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Replies to the Lake Society Regarding Measures to Stop Land Reclamation in Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>The Lake Society of this city, concerned that land reclamation in East Taihu Lake would hinder downstream water conservancy, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting the immediate dispatch of personnel to conduct a survey, order the removal of reclamation structures, and implement dredging to facilitate drainage. Subsequently, the Society received a telegram from Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that the magistrates of Wujiang and Wuxian counties had already conducted a survey and reported that the situation was accurate. The Provincial Government has formulated the "Outline of Measures for the Jiangsu Province to Stop Land Reclamation in Taihu Lake," in seven articles, and instructed all lakeside county governments in the province to strictly comply and has dispatched personnel to various counties to inspect and supervise. Regarding the implementation of dredging measures, personnel have also been dispatched to consult with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission to promptly proceed with the work in the Jiangsu Province section.</p>
<p>Attached is the Outline of Measures for the Jiangsu Province to Stop Land Reclamation in Taihu Lake: (1) Any newly reclaimed lake land after August of the 17th year of the Republic (1928) that has not been surveyed and approved for allocation by the Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Engineering Office or the Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Commission shall be treated as privately reclaimed and developed land. If it obstructs water conservancy, it shall be reclaimed by the state at the original allocated price, and the dikes and enclosures shall be removed. If it is found that there was concealed reporting of increased grain tax after the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), in addition to ordering the owners to remove the dikes and enclosures and eradicate the planted crops to restore the original state, the increased grain tax mu shall be confiscated. If the county officials in charge are found to have colluded in fraudulent practices, they shall be dismissed from their posts and severely punished. (2) Any privately reclaimed fields and marshes that have not been approved for allocation, regardless of whether they have been enclosed, shall be dealt with by arresting the reclaimers and ordering them to demolish the dikes and remove the planted vegetation within a specified period to restore the original state, and permanently prohibit occupation and reclamation. (3) Each county government shall immediately issue a notice, reiterating the permanent prohibition of private enclosure of lake land, and expedite the production of detailed maps of the topography of the lakeside fields and marshes, dispatch personnel to patrol at any time, and report monthly. If it is found that there are still cases of private enclosure in the future, in addition to handling according to Article 2, the county magistrate and the district chief in charge shall be subject to appropriate punishment. (4) The fields and marshes bordering Taihu Lake in each county within the province shall be surveyed in detail by a surveying team jointly dispatched by the Taihu Lake and Field Clearing Office, the water conservancy authority in this province, and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, to determine the topographic features of the lakeside, delineate the sections, and set a deadline for completion, as the basis for planning the ring-lake waterways and clearing the scope of the lake fields. (5) The Taihu Lake and Field Clearing Office, the water conservancy authority in this province, shall, together with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, dispatch personnel to various lakeside counties within the province to investigate the grain tax registers for the fields and marshes bordering the lake, transcribe and compile a table, affix the seals of the county magistrate and the officials in charge, and store it separately for reference, to determine the scope and prevent the abuse of private tax increases. (6) The allocation of reclaimed and developed fields and mu by the Taihu Lake and Field Clearing Office and the increase in grain tax for fields and marshes by the county governments shall be carried out only after consultation with the water conservancy authorities of this province and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. (7) These measures shall be implemented after being resolved and promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee.</p>

<h3>Internal Account Settlement at the Fish Market on the 23rd; Depositors Urged to Return Deposits; Fish Merchants Not Returning Loans; Fish Market Increasingly Showing Distress</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai 16th Pier fish market has been using deposits from various parties for turnover and lending to fish merchants. Recently, due to the tight money situation, depositors have been urging the fish market to return their deposits. However, the fish market has been unable to recover the loans and cannot return the deposits. The 23rd of this month (the 23rd day of the sixth lunar month) is the internal account settlement date for the fish market. The fish merchants are currently unable to repay the fish market due to low fish prices. The fish market also has no money to return to the depositors, resulting in a deadlock. It is unknown how the accounts will be settled at that time. Moreover, after the opening of the fish market, all fish markets must be merged into the market as brokers. There will be no loan relationships with fish merchants and no way to attract deposits from depositors. Therefore, depositors are increasingly urging for the return of their deposits, and the fish market is increasingly showing distress.</p>

<h3>Economic Credit Cooperative Plans to Establish a Consumer Cooperative</h3>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative, located at 918 Aiduya Road in Shanghai, currently has more than 1,200 members. It is felt that the lack of purchasing channels for daily necessities and milk drinks has led to the outflow of profits, resulting in significant losses for the members. In recent years, members have entrusted the cooperative to handle the purchase of goods more than a dozen times a month. In order to ensure the economic benefits and convenience of the members' consumption, Mr. Qiu Hanping, the director of the cooperative, has made meticulous plans and is separately establishing a consumer cooperative. The capital stock is tentatively set at 1,000 yuan, with the cooperative allocating 250 yuan from its public welfare fund. The remainder will be subscribed to by the members. Within three hours, the share capital has been fully subscribed. It is scheduled to be established on August 1st. It is heard that the cooperative's business will be divided into sales, agency, and promotion departments. It is currently working on studying the individual daily needs of the cooperative's members in order to determine the standards for selecting goods. Furthermore, in order to encourage members to gather together, a dining area will be attached to the cooperative's second-floor hall, which will be managed by Guanshengyuan.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Circular: Do Not Publish Advertisements Soliciting Business – Issued by Le Junying Regarding the Dari News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday sent a notice to all members, stating, "Respectfully, according to a letter from member Le Junying, the Shanghai Dari News repeatedly sent personnel to members to solicit advertisements for the Shanghai Lawyer Title Bar, although the amount was only five yuan. However, the member believed that lawyers should strictly adhere to ethical standards and should not engage in any publicity. This was politely declined. Unexpectedly, on June 26, the newspaper wielded its mighty pen and made a big joke at the expense of the member. The article stated, 'Brother lawyers, going their separate ways, lawyer Le Junying blushing,' etc., which was completely a hodgepodge of material from a case handled by my younger brother Junfen, pieced together and used to mock the member. According to the newspaper, it was not a work of genius, nor a blank sheet of paper, but in reality, it was indeed retaliation for refusing to publish the advertisement. The fact that the newspaper is close to extortion is something that many in the legal profession have been deceived by. Those colleagues who advertise in the Dari News may feel obligated due to personal relationships and do so carelessly. However, it is unexpected that those who contribute money without any consideration are actually providing fuel for those who intentionally do evil. This is something that our colleagues should learn from and be wary of in the future. In the member's humble opinion, it is proposed to submit this matter to the executive committee for deliberation. Members should not allow themselves to be used by disguised advertisements in small newspapers, in order to maintain ethical standards and demonstrate unity. Is this appropriate? We respectfully request your public decision. Attached is a copy of the Dari News from June 26 for your review," etc. Accordingly, this matter was submitted to the 200th executive committee meeting of the association for discussion. It was agreed that in the past, in order to rectify ethical standards, all members were notified on October 29 of the previous year that, with regard to publishing advertisements, in addition to representing parties or for the relocation of offices, changes of telephone numbers, or for the commencement of duties, and New Year's greetings, they should not publish advertisements that are close to soliciting litigation, or only publish their names, office locations, and telephone numbers. Now, according to the letter from member Le, although some members may have forgotten the previous proposal, it concerns ethical standards, and the previous proposal should be reiterated. It was resolved to notify all members to prohibit the publication of advertisements soliciting business in newspapers. The corresponding letter is hereby issued in the hope that you will take note and act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Dahua Sugar Factory: Self-Made Domestic Sugar Products That Are on Par with Imported Products</h3>
<p>The Dahua Domestic Sugar Factory, located at 55 Yangxing Street in the French Concession of Shanghai, has officially started operations recently. The produced cottony white sugar is divided into four grades: "One," "Unity," "Mountain," and "River." It is bright, smooth, and long-lasting, and can be on par with imported products. Various rock candies are also produced, divided into large-character crystal rock candy, Hua-character sliced rock candy, and the four grades "One," "Unity," "Mountain," and "River." They are crystalline, pure, and fresh, all reaching the highest quality. The raw materials are all domestic cane sugar, so the sweetness is particularly rich, far beyond what other sugars can match. The hired technicians are all experienced experts, and the manufacturing methods are novel and ingenious. Various iced flower green sugars are also being prepared for production. The factory uses the Three Stars brand, which has been registered with the Ministry of Industry for exclusive use. From now on, it will be sold domestically to meet the needs of the Chinese people, which is enough to recover a portion of lost profits and stop unnecessary leaks. It is truly an excellent phenomenon in the year of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Two Bookstores Confiscated Anti-Japanese Books and Pictures</h3>
<p>According to the application from Ding Shunbao and Shao Mingyuan from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, the Laozha Police Station issued two search warrants from the Shanghai First Special District Court and confiscated six copies of the anti-Japanese book "Research on the Brutal Japanese Invasion of the Northeast" from the Beixin Bookstore at 371 Fuzhou Road. In addition, the anti-Japanese books "Panoramic View of Japanese Invasion of China Comics" and "Plan of Japanese Invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia Railway Network," totaling 26 sheets, were confiscated from the Wenhua Fine Arts Bookstore at 380 Fuzhou Road. All were taken back to the police station. After the police station kept one copy of the confiscated books and pictures for reference, the remaining copies were submitted by police lawyer Jiang Baolian to Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court for disposition. After review by Judge Feng, he ordered them to be stored in the warehouse for verification.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing on the Case of Selling Anti-Japanese Pictures: Who Should Be Responsible for the Capital Issue? The Police Station Requests an Extension for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Western Detective of the Huishan Police Station arrested a vendor named Wang Bingnan on Maohai Road on the morning of the 9th of this month for selling anti-Japanese books such as "The 19th Route Army." According to the vendor, the books were wholesale from the Wenhua Fine Arts Bookstore at 380 Fuzhou Road. The police station then applied for a search warrant from the First Special Court and went to the bookstore to confiscate the books, totaling 2,840 copies. Wang Bingnan has already been convicted by the court, and the confiscated books are temporarily detained. All these details have been reported in various newspapers. Now, the police station is prosecuting the manager of the bookstore, Ningbo native Wang Xiqing, for inciting others to resist the law under Article 153, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo summoned Wang to the Fifth Criminal Court for questioning. Wang appeared in court as summoned. First, the police station stated the intent of the prosecution. Then, the defendant Wang Xiqing raised a defense, stating that Wenhua was originally named Wenhua Fine Arts Bookstore Company, and later it was divided into two departments: one was Wenhua Fine Arts Printing Company, located on Zhoujiazui Road, and the other was Wenhua Fine Arts Bookstore Limited Company, located at 380 Fuzhou Road. The Wenhua Fine Arts Bookstore Limited Company closed on the 30th of last month. He, along with Lu Buzhou and two others, took over the business on July 5th and opened on the 7th, renaming it Wenhua Fine Arts Bookstore and establishing the Shanghai Bookstore Discount Market. He served as the chief accountant. On the 7th, they opened, and on the 9th, before the books they had taken over were completely sorted, the police station came to search. Therefore, there is a mistake in the first point, the subject of the lawsuit. Secondly, regarding the issue of responsibility, they were not intentional, but due to insufficient sorting. According to Article 12 of the Criminal Law, there is no punishment. He also presented newspaper contracts as proof. The police station then requested that the case be postponed to investigate who should be responsible for this case, and requested that the contracts and newspapers presented by the defendant be temporarily handed over to the police station for investigation. Judge Dai, after reviewing the report, ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Two Murder Cases in Tanziwan: One Was a Husband Beating His Wife, and the Other Was Playfully Striking a Vital Point</h3>
<p>At 0:50 yesterday morning, police officer Yuan Yao of the Tanziwan Police Station in Zhabei, according to the plaintiff Shen Qicheng and witness Huang Jinjie, stated that his younger sister (Xu Shen's) was beaten to death by her brother-in-law Xu Jingen. Officer Yuan immediately accompanied Shen and others to a thatched shed in Huazibang, where they indeed saw Shen's lying dead on a bed. Xu Jingen, along with the plaintiff and witness, were taken to the police station and transferred to the Xinzha Branch, where officer Huang Chongren interrogated them. According to Shen Qicheng, 46 years old, from Jiancheng, living in a thatched shed in Pingjiangqiao, working as a garbage collector, his brother-in-law Xu Jingen likes to gamble. His younger sister Xu Shen's (37 years old this year, with four children, the eldest 18 years old and the youngest 11 years old) repeatedly advised him not to listen, which led to quarrels and beatings, eventually killing his sister. Xu Jingen stated that he is 38 years old and does gamble. However, the quarrel last night was because he pawned his wife's clothes. She wanted him to redeem them, but he didn't have the money, so she grabbed him. He pushed her, and her head hit the wall, causing her death. Huang Jinjie stated that he saw Xu Jingen beating the woman. At that time, he couldn't pull them apart by himself. He called two or three people to pull them apart. Shen's hit her head on the wall. After they were dispersed, Shen's died two hours later. After the interrogating officer verified the confessions, he reported the case to the Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau and ordered the Tanziwan Police Station to have the local guarantor submit a report to the Shanghai Local Court for inspection, as the case concerned human life. Furthermore, at 10:20 am, in the Dayangqiao area under the jurisdiction of the Tanziwan Police Station of the Xinzha Branch in Zhabei, Ma Ajin, who lived there, said to Ge Xueguang (also known as Ge Shuqing), "Let's go play together." It is said that Ma often bullied Ge, which made Ge unwilling to go with Ma, and they had a scuffle. Ge was weak and was struck by Ma, falling to the ground. Ge's brother, Xue Shi, saw this and immediately called the police to come and arrest Ma Ajin, taking him to the Xinzha Branch. Officer Huang observed that the injured Ge Xueguang was seriously injured, so he immediately ordered him to be sent to the Pushan Hospital for treatment. The doctor examined him and found that the injured person's internal organs were injured in vital parts (i.e., the lungs, etc.), so after administering medicine, he was ordered to be quickly carried back. He died of his injuries at around 2:00 pm. The deceased was only 20 years old. The murderer, Ma Ajin (22 years old), is currently detained at the Xinzha Branch, pending verification by the Shanghai Local Court after the local guarantor submits a report today.</p>

<h3>Heavy Thunderstorm in Shanghai Yesterday: Thunder Shook Houses After Sultry Weather, Houses Collapsed, People Were Injured, and Stone Mills Flew Out</h3>
<p>(Thunder Shook Seven Times) Shanghai has been extremely hot for the past week. After a brief shower the day before yesterday, the weather was still sultry. The heat became even worse yesterday morning. At 1:00 pm, thunder rumbled continuously in the sky, and lightning flashed. Within three minutes, from 1:26 pm to 1:29 pm, thunder shook seven times, causing houses to shake. Heavy rain poured down, lasting for about half an hour. There was another heavy rain at 2:40 am this morning.</p>
<p>(Hurricane Trend) Yesterday, the wind direction changed from northwest to southeast, so the rain moved from northwest to east. The rainfall was heavy in Zhenru and Wusong districts, slightly less in the Public Concession and the French Concession, and there was no rain in the Xujiahui area of the western district. After the rain, the fields immediately appeared lush and pleasing. It is also learned that the temperature did not drop before the rain, with a minimum of 79.5 and a maximum of 98.1. As for the hurricane discovered in the South Pacific, according to the Xujiatu Observatory's report at 2:00 pm yesterday, it has reached 125 degrees east longitude and 21 degrees north latitude. The wind force is similar to that of yesterday morning, with a tendency to linger in the Pacific Ocean, and the wind direction is north-northwest.</p>
<p>(House Collapse Injures People) A building at 27 Sanle Lane, Xingjiazhaizhai Road, Zhabei, collapsed at around 1:50 pm yesterday during the heavy rain and thunderstorms. The house had been in disrepair for many years and could not withstand the strong winds, so it collapsed with a loud noise. At that time, there were two people inside, Jiang Xiangfu, 53 years old, from Zhejiang, working as a laborer, and Yan Ad, 23 years old, from Guangdong, working as a vendor. They were unable to escape in time and were injured by falling bricks and tiles. Fortunately, the police on duty saw it and quickly reported it to the Zhabei Fire Brigade, who drove to the scene and dragged the two people out of the rubble, taking them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is heard that the injuries are minor and there should be no major problems. However, a group of people who relied on hearsay mistakenly believed that they had been struck by lightning, so the news spread far and wide, and crowds of onlookers gathered.</p>
<p>(Stone Mill Flying Out) In the Yangshupu area, there was indeed an electrical incident. The victim was a tofu shop on Linqing Road. When the lightning flashed, the shop was using a motor to grind tofu. Unexpectedly, the electricity in the air came into contact with the electricity emitted by the motor, and with a loud noise, the stone mill came off its base and flew out of the house. Fortunately, there were few pedestrians at the time, so no one was injured.</p>
<p>(Trees Uprooted in Jiangwan) Yesterday's wind was extremely strong. In the Jiangwan area, as well as the city center, Xiangyin Road, Songni Road, and Dongtiyuhui Road, billboards were blown down, trees were uprooted, and many utility poles were blown down. Power lines fell to the ground, causing the phone lines in Jiangwan to be temporarily cut off. In addition, the thatched huts in Jiangwan Xiaoguanyuan and the newly built thatched shelters in the Sports Garden have all collapsed, resulting in considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Heavy Thunderstorm: Drunk Man Wields a Knife to Attack People</h3>
<p>Disturbed Nerves Due to Excessive Drinking: Wielding a Knife in a Frenzy, Like a Seizure</p>
<p>Chang Chongkun, a 50-year-old native of Zhenhai, has been operating a vegetable stall at Langjiaqiao in Nanshi, residing at 5-27 Mietuo Street, Qingnian Puyi Society. Yesterday at noon, he was drinking with friends at home. After finishing drinking at around 3:00 pm, his friends separated from Chang and left. Chang drank too much and the heat made him momentarily delirious. He lay on the ground in front of his door. It happened to be pouring rain with loud thunder. Chang woke up startled by the thunder, ran into his house, grabbed a kitchen knife, and danced around, singing Peking Opera tunes as he went out the door and walked out of the alley. He walked to the door of No. 2 next door, where Wei Xu, the wife of Wei Shukang, who runs a medicinal materials business and lives at No. 2, was sitting at the door cooling off while holding her one-year-old child. Chang rushed up with the knife and slashed Mrs. Wei twice, once on the left side of her head and once on the right, cutting about an inch deep. Blood flowed freely, and she immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. At that time, Xu Xiangsheng, a Ningbo native who works as a cook at a rice shop on Doushi Street, passed by the entrance of the alley and saw Chang wielding a knife and slashing at Mrs. Wei. He stepped forward to try to take the knife away, but Chang slashed him once on the forehead and once on the arm. Xu, in extreme pain, fell to the ground and cried for help. Neighbors heard the sound and came out to see and reported it to the patrolling police, who rushed to the scene. They saw Chang fleeing with the knife. The police stepped forward and took the murder weapon and took Chang and the two victims, Mrs. Wei and Xu Xiangsheng, by car to the Xundao Street Police Station. After questioning by Director Jin, he immediately sent Mrs. Wei and Xu Xiangsheng to the Nanyang Hospital in Xiaodongmen for treatment. He sent Chang Chongkun, who had committed the crime, to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. It is heard that Mrs. Wei was the most seriously injured. Because of her head injuries, her condition is critical.</p>
<h3>Case of a Police Officer Shot: Five Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>Victim Identifies That They Are Not the Perpetrators: Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau for a Smoke Case</p>
<p>Director Jin of the Xundao Street Police Station in the city reported that the police officer who was shot by bandits had been receiving treatment at the Shanghai Hospital and had not yet been discharged. Recently, the station has repeatedly received anonymous letters reporting that the perpetrators who shot the police officer were hiding at 4 Liucun. After Director Jin investigated, he learned that Liucun was under the jurisdiction of the Laobeimen Police Station. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 pm, he dispatched patrol officer Xu Fenghan to the Laobeimen Police Station and requested that police be dispatched to assist in the arrest. Director Shen immediately dispatched patrol officer Zhang Lantian, leading police chief Gao Kui, police officer Liu Guangsheng, and others to rush to the scene. They arrested five suspects, including Chen Shiyi, and found that Chen Zuyi was privately selling opium lamps and consuming opium, along with evidence such as opium pipes and lamps. All were taken to the police station. After interrogation by Director Shen, the defendants Chen Zuyi, Ye Jinrong, Cai Deyu, and Shen Yinzhang confessed to consuming opium. The defendant Yan Ziping stated that he was visiting a friend. All the defendants firmly denied any involvement in the case of the police officer being shot in Xundao Street. Furthermore, there was no corroborating evidence. Chen Zuyi and the other five suspects were taken to the Shanghai Hospital, and the injured police officer identified them one by one. None of them were the perpetrators in the case. Because the case involved opium prohibition, they were handed over to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhu Fusheng, a 22-year-old native of Changzhou, lived at 8 Yangdeli Lane, Singapore Road, Husi, Shanghai. He made a living as a vendor. On the evening of the 18th, while he was selling melons at the entrance of the lane, two enemies suddenly came with axes used by carpenters. They jumped on him from behind and slashed at Zhu, injuring his shoulders, arms, chest, and back. He bled profusely and fell to the ground in extreme pain. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, immediately fled without a trace. The nearby police on duty heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. They took the injured man to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but he died of his injuries at around 8:00 pm due to excessive blood loss. Director Wang of the Caojiadu Branch, upon receiving the report, considered the case to be an assassination. In addition to immediately ordering the local guarantor to report it to the Local Court for inspection, he also issued an order to all officers and detectives to quickly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Old Man Sang Zhi-chuan Sues Son and Daughter-in-law for Robbery</h3>
<p>Son claims father consorted with a dissolute woman; clothing was indeed taken back by the mother – Court hearing concluded, sentencing scheduled</p>
<p>Sang Zhi-chuan, a native of Ningbo, is currently 59 years old. He resides at No. 58 Changyun Lane, Xin Dagulu. Before the January 28th Shanghai Incident, he ran Heng Xin Tai Leather Goods Store on Ai Duya Road and was considered a relatively well-off household. All four of his sons are grown and employed. Therefore, even though he closed the leather goods store after the war, he still enjoyed the harmony of family life. Sang has been deaf for many years. However, instead of enjoying his twilight years at home, he indulges in seeking pleasure and hunting for romance outside. He became romantically involved with Chen Yuru, a young woman from Jiangxi. Initially, he rented a place to set up a small household. Later, he brought Chen back home, causing great dissatisfaction among his sons and daughters-in-law. From then on, father and sons were like ice and charcoal, and the old man and daughters-in-law were like fire and water. Sang then moved with Chen elsewhere. He also filed civil and criminal lawsuits with the First Special District Court, claiming that his sons did not provide for him. The case was initially settled peacefully after the judge's mediation. However, soon the relationship between Sang and Chen soured, leading to mutual lawsuits in court. That case just ended this spring. Now, Sang suddenly accuses his sons Sang Jianheng, Jianzhang, Fuyuan, and his daughter-in-law Sang Hu, of robbery. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Shide of the First Special Court opened the court to question both parties. The plaintiff, Sang Zhi-chuan, is both hard of hearing and suffers from nervous disorders. His testimony in court was quite disjointed. He relied on a messenger to loudly relay the questions to his ear, or used written notes to communicate. According to Sang, the items robbed by his sons and daughters-in-law included over thirty leather trunks filled with silk clothes, gold jewelry, and other valuables. This occurred on the 20th of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) when he lived at No. 10, Jinrui Lane, Kaifeng Road. Sang's sons, Jianheng, Jianzhang, and Fuyuan, all claimed that their father is not only deaf but also senile, with eccentric behavior. At such an old age, he still consorted with a dissolute woman, causing their mother great distress, leading her to repeatedly attempt suicide. They stated that the clothing trunks were taken back by their mother, not robbed. Sang Hu also denied robbing any property, saying that she only went with her mother-in-law once. Judge Feng, seeing that the facts were clear, instructed the lawyers of both parties to begin their arguments. After they concluded, he ordered them to wait for sentencing next Friday.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Construction of Xijing, the Power Plant Has Begun Construction</h3>
<p>Our authorities are actively developing the Northwest, and Xijing is particularly important as a key hub in the Northwest. Transportation is convenient with the Longhai Railway directly reaching it, and air and road transport are also readily available. The city is thriving, unlike in the past. However, electricity is still lacking. Since the establishment of the National Economic Construction Committee, it has paid particular attention to the national electricity sector. Recently, it was heard from Xijing that the committee has appointed Shou Guangwei, the former engineer of the Luoyang Central Military Academy power plant, as the director and engineer of the Xijing Power Plant Office. He set off a few days ago to prepare everything, and the power plant's engine room is also being actively built in advance. It is estimated that it will be completed and generating electricity in ten months. It is said that Shou Guangwei has rich knowledge and experience in the electrical industry and is highly regarded. In the past two years, he has endured many hardships traveling from Beijing and Luoyang to Shaanxi, with the aim of studying the situation in the Northwest, showing a spirit of serving the country, which is rare.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of Floods in Various Counties of Hubei Province – Report from the Hubei Sino-Foreign Relief Society</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Society on Renji Road received a report yesterday from the Hubei Sino-Foreign Relief Society about the severe floods. The details are as follows: To the esteemed Society, unfortunately, the people of Hubei have suffered from both natural and man-made disasters for several years. This year's spring harvest was fortunately at 70%, and we hoped that the great calamity was over and that peace would gradually return. Unexpectedly, since the 20th of last month, fierce winds and incessant rain have wreaked havoc. The situation worsened in early August, causing flash floods and major surges in both the Yangtze and Han Rivers. We have already sent a letter to your Society for inspection. Although the weather has cleared now, on the 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th, the Xiang River experienced raging currents, and many breaches occurred below Zhongxiang. The Ma Bu, Guai Yu, and Ma Hua dikes along the Yangtze River also breached successively, inundating countless residents on both sides. Although Wuhan has been mobilized by various agencies and organizations to rush repairs day and night, it has so far been preserved, but it remains in imminent danger. Whether it can be spared in the future is uncertain, even according to the flood control authorities, as the rainy season in the Yangtze and Han Rivers is at its peak, and the hope for tranquility is still far away. Our Society has received disaster reports and requests for relief from as many as 32 counties, and there are undoubtedly many more that have not yet reported. Considering the situation, the extent of the flooded areas and the severity of the disaster for the people mean that even if the dikes do not breach again, the disaster is already twice as severe as the floods of 1931. However, during the great flood of 1931, your Society cared for the people of Hubei, generously donating funds and food for relief, saving many lives. This year's flood is exceptionally cruel, with widespread suffering and urgent need for food. We sincerely request your strong assistance and a donation of a large number of medicines to provide relief and save the survivors.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Simple Life Insurance and Social Insurance by Zhang Mingxin</h3>
<p>Simple life insurance is a type of social insurance. Its purpose is the same as social insurance, which is to stabilize people's livelihoods and realize social policies. The only difference is that its use and methods are different. Before we discuss simple life insurance, we should briefly describe the principles of social insurance so that its system is clear and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the laboring classes in European industrialized countries have felt the inevitability of illness, disaster, injury, aging, and death. Therefore, they all first had mutual aid combinations for mutual relief. Then, the government authorities, in order to improve the welfare of the people and alleviate social problems, enacted various social insurance laws. The insured objects are divided into mandatory and voluntary participation. The insurance agencies are either exclusively operated by national bureaus or attached to labor union autonomous organizations. They all decide which policies to adopt based on whether they are suitable for their national conditions. Until now, its organization has become increasingly sophisticated. Modern scholars often list social insurance as seven types: disease, injury, childbirth, disability, aging, death, and unemployment. Simple life insurance, which is a small amount of personal insurance, can either coexist or be used with different degrees of emphasis. However, its benefits to the national economy and people's livelihood and its effectiveness can be said to have the same goal by different routes. Now, the historical summaries and miscellaneous analyses of the two are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A Brief History of Social Insurance</p>
<p>Social insurance originated in Germany in Europe. In 1883 and 1884, it was the first to formulate compulsory disease and injury insurance laws, which was the beginning of social insurance. Its main purpose was to seek the welfare of the people and to alleviate the rising socialism at that time in order to maintain the order of national security. However, the promulgation of this system had a significant impact on other countries, and they continued to follow suit. In short, before this, there was the plan of compulsory purchase of annuities from the government by the people in the United Kingdom in 1878. Later, in 1894, Switzerland had a trial run of unemployment insurance. The labor union unemployment subsidy established in Ghent City in Belgium in 1901 was the pioneer of modern unemployment insurance. Hungary and France also successively held compulsory life insurance in 1906 and 1910. The United Kingdom established disease and pregnancy insurance in 1911. In the United States, due to dissatisfaction with the employer's liability insurance, criticisms arose. Therefore, in 1911, there was the enactment of the Compulsory Labor Injury Insurance Law. Later, other types of insurance were also established one after another. Japan established "Simple Life Insurance" in 1916, and at the same time, there was the enactment of the Factory Enforcement Order, the Mine Workers Labor Assistance Rules, and the Servant Assistance Order. It was also a great success for late-starting social insurance.</p>
<p>(2) The Meaning of Social Insurance</p>
<p>Social insurance has a narrow and a broad meaning. The narrow meaning is disease and old-age insurance, while the broad meaning includes insurance for all disasters suffered by the public. However, the meaning of modern social insurance contains the following three main purposes:</p>
<p>(1) To compensate people for the loss of wages due to accidental illness or disability.</p>
<p>(2) To protect the economy of the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>(3) To provide living expenses in old age. Therefore, the meaning of social insurance is a system to protect the people in the lower and middle classes from the losses caused by accidents, illnesses, disabilities, old age, unemployment, or death to themselves and their families, so as to avoid economic insecurity. However, state-run insurance is not all social insurance. In other words, regardless of the type of insurance, all those that do not compete for profit are social insurance. Therefore, in addition to personal injury risks, other property insurance (such as fire, flood, and theft of equipment and household property) that has these elements can also be called social insurance. Simple life insurance accounts for two of the above three purposes, namely (1) protecting the economy of the families of the deceased and (2) providing living expenses in old age.</p>
<p>(3) A Brief History of Simple Life Insurance</p>
<p>When we look back to the past, such as the friendship associations in the Greek era, the funeral organizations in Rome, and various mutual aid combinations in Germany, their purpose was all based on the donations of the majority to relieve the misfortune of the minority. Also, in the 17th century, England began to have friendly associations, Friendly Society, and funeral societies. Although their methods were still simple, they were quite suitable for the needs of the general people at that time. The form of simple life insurance was already present, but on a small scale. It was not until the 19th century that modern simple life insurance was established. In 1849, the Industrial and General Insurance Co. of England began to issue industrial life insurance (simple life insurance is called industrial life insurance in Europe and the United States) policies. Five years later, the company was renamed Prudential Insurance Company and merged. After 70 years of operation, its prompt compensation was praised by society. This industrial life insurance was noticed by countries all over the world, and the United States quickly followed suit. However, at that time, the United States provided insurance to workers mostly through various friendship organizations. However, the mismanagement of these organizations often led to the loss of all the money paid by the members. Therefore, in 1877, a life insurance company was organized to issue industrial life insurance policies. The premiums were calculated on a weekly basis, but there was no provision for sending people to collect directly from policyholders. Since then, new methods of industrial life insurance have emerged one after another. Life insurers have also realized that paying weekly fees can allow the insured and their families to benefit from life insurance. Therefore, this small-amount life insurance has once again attracted the attention of people in the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Although the development of industrial life insurance in the United States was later, its process was no different from that in the United Kingdom. The imperfect night friendship organizations at that time were replaced by the scientific industrial life insurance system due to the changes in the times. In 1873, the United States experienced an economic panic, and most workers' families became impoverished due to the premature death of the head of the family. Coupled with the positive response from the success of industrial life insurance in the United Kingdom, people increasingly recognized the importance of life insurance protection, and the Widows and Orphans' Benefit Society was established. In 1877, this organization was renamed the Prudential Insurance Co. of America. In 1879, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and the John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. also began to handle industrial insurance. Since then, other life insurance companies have successively handled this business, but due to the small scale, it was difficult to develop, or it was discontinued shortly after. Therefore, the three companies "Capital", "Prudential", and "John Hancock" were the leaders of industrial life insurance in the United States. The contract amount of these three major companies accounted for about 74% of the total amount in the United States. The success can be said to be extremely high. Countries all over the world have also recognized the importance of industrial life insurance to the interests of the people and have followed suit. The Japanese life insurance system began in 1881, and has gradually developed since then. The government authorities, in view of the deep need for simple life insurance for the people, and with the rapid development of industry and commerce after the end of the Russo-Japanese War, quickly caught up and prepared for it. In 1916, the postal service began to handle simple life insurance, and its success exceeded the expectations of the authorities. At the beginning of the first year, the estimated contract was 126,000. However, the result of the first year (only six months from October 1916 to April 1917) exceeded the budget by more than double. In 1920, due to the rapid development of business and the increase in staff, in order to seek convenience in unified management, the Simple Insurance Bureau was established to supervise and direct it. 1926 was the tenth anniversary of its establishment of simple life insurance. There were more than 10 million contracts, and the insured amount exceeded 1.2 billion yuan. In the same year, the postal annuity business was established to meet the needs of the people. By 1931, due to the consolidation of the simple life insurance foundation and the increase in accumulated funds, more dangerous children's insurance began to be handled. Although it has not been long, its results are also good.</p>
<p>Japan has only had 18 years of history since it opened simple life insurance. Its excellent results are unmatched in the world's state-run life insurance business. It is estimated that when life insurance experts from all over the world met in London, the Japanese representative reported its results, and all the people in the room were surprised and praised. There have been many people from Europe and the United States who have sent people to Japan to investigate. Poland is now eager to follow suit, and other countries are also preparing to establish it. As of recently, its insured amount has reached 3 billion yuan, there are more than 22.2 million contracts, the monthly premium income is about 18 million yuan, an average of more than 7,000 new policies are issued every day, and the number of accumulated lives (October 1934) has reached more than 900 million yuan. In total, 30% of the people in the country have simple life insurance. From the above figures, it can be said that it has developed rapidly and has been rising rapidly. However, the staff members are not complacent and are still studying and improving the energy. Now, the statistics of the achievements of simple life insurance in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Sixth National Games Organization - Ball Games Scheduling Committee</h3>
<p>Field event preliminaries will still take the top six, no increase in quota; the Organizing Committee has already notified all participating units to handle registration.</p>
<p>The Sixth National Games are being actively prepared without sparing any effort. The schedules for track and field all-around events and swimming have already been arranged and announced. The schedules for ball games are also being organized by various committees, based on the principles of allocation, and are starting to be arranged. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ball Games Scheduling Committee and Scheduling Principles</p>
<p>Whether the arrangement of ball game schedules in this Games is appropriate or not is closely related to the championships and the second, third, and fourth places in various ball games. It is necessary to gather opinions from all parties and arrange them properly, so as to pool wisdom and avoid any possible errors. After deliberation by the Competition Committee, Wu Yunrui, Yuan Jiaoli, and Rong Qizhao were appointed as three committee members to be responsible for organizing five sub-committees: (1) Football Group, (2) Men's and Women's Basketball Group, (3) Men's and Women's Volleyball Group, (4) Men's and Women's Baseball and Softball Group, (5) Men's and Women's Tennis Group. Each group will have seven members. The candidates have already been decided, and the Organizing Committee will send letters of appointment to them separately. The list of members of the five sub-committees and the principles of scheduling are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Ball Games Scheduling Committee</p>
<p>(1) Football Group: Zhou Jia, Yu Hengzhi, Ma Detai, Li Huitang, Song Ruhai, Zhang Xinfu, Chen Changyou.</p>
<p>(2) Men's and Women's Basketball Group: Dong Shouyang, Shu Hong, Liu Quanda, Song Junfu, Wu Defan, Gao Zi, Wang Jingzhi.</p>

<p>(5) Men's and Women's Tennis Group: Ling Daoyang, Hu Xiansheng, Wang Yaodong, Cui Zhiru, Jiang Daozhang, He Jialiu, Ma Detai.</p>
<p>(B) Principles of Ball Games Scheduling</p>
<p>(1) Please, each committee member, based on their personal opinion, select the eight units with the best performance and, before September 10th, list them in order of preference, sign and stamp the list, and send it to the Registration and Scheduling Section of this Committee in the Central District of Shanghai (the form will be issued by the Committee).</p>
<p>(2) The Registration and Scheduling Section will summarize the results selected by each committee member and put forward the eight units with the most votes to prepare for the seeding method.</p>
<p>(3) Among these eight units, the four units with the most votes will be selected again and drawn by lot to be placed in the upper and lower sections of the draw. The remaining four units will be drawn and arranged in different sections using the same method.</p>
<p>(4) If there are units with the same number of votes, the order of precedence in the list of preferences of each committee member will be used as the standard for distinguishing stages.</p>
<p>(5) According to the above rules, those who ideally obtain the right to the semi-finals have been completely arranged to avoid meeting in the first round of the competition. Then, the remaining units will be drawn and arranged in the empty spaces in the complete order.</p>
<p>(6) For the tennis competition schedule, each unit in singles will have one person placed in each of the upper and lower sections, which will be determined by drawing lots. The distribution methods for the upper and lower sections of singles and doubles are exactly the same.</p>
<p>(7) If there are special circumstances, they will be submitted to this Committee for joint decision at any time.</p>
<p>(8) When the Registration and Scheduling Section starts drawing based on the votes cast by each committee member, it will be done under the personal supervision of the Chief of Preparations to show seriousness. The procedure is the same spirit as drawing the Davis Cup draw in front of the head of state.</p>
<p>Regulations on Overtime in Football Matches</p>
<p>Article 17(c) of Chapter 10 of the Competition Regulations of the Games, Men's Football Championship: "If the two teams are tied in a match, overtime should be played to resolve the tie. If the score is still tied after overtime, the game will not be extended further and will be replayed at a time to be determined before the next week's match." After investigation, there are no explicit provisions for overtime in the rules of football. Therefore, the Organizing Committee decided at its 7th Standing Committee meeting that this overtime should be set at 30 minutes, with the two sides switching goals after 15 minutes, without a break in between.</p>
<p>Tennis Courts and Balls</p>
<p>Tennis matches are stipulated to be held exclusively on hard courts. The balls used are stipulated to be "Slazenger" brand.</p>
<p>Number of Participants in Field Event Finals</p>
<p>In previous Games, four places were awarded for each track and field event. For field event preliminaries (except for high jump and pole vault), the six with the best results would advance to the finals. Now, the number of places awarded has been changed to six, so there have been inquiries about whether the number of participants in the field event finals will be increased. After investigation, the rules adopted by this Committee are those approved by the International Athletic Association. The rules stipulate that the number of participants in field event finals is six. Moreover, the World Games are organized by the International Athletic Association, and the number of places awarded in the World Games is also the same as in this Games. Therefore, this Games will not change the number of participants in field event finals due to the increase in the number of places awarded. (Some say that although six places are awarded in the World Games, only the top three receive prizes, and the last three are for record-keeping purposes, while in the National Games, all six receive prizes and points, so the situation seems different. However, it should be known that giving prizes is originally a symbol of honor, and scoring is only a way to increase interest and has no relation to the essence of the competition. Therefore, this Games will not change the rules due to such minor details, especially since the World Games does not adopt a scoring system at all.)</p>
<p>Start of Registration</p>
<p>The athlete registration cards, various registration forms, and competition regulations of this Committee have all been sent to each unit by registered mail. This marks the beginning of registration. The original letter to each unit is as follows:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: After investigation, the athlete registration cards and various registration forms for each unit participating in the competitions of this Committee, except for the Wushu section, have been printed by this Committee and should be distributed to each unit. Please fill them out in detail in accordance with the provisions of the Competition Regulations of this Games and the points to note during registration in Notice No. 2 of this Committee, and send them to this Committee in the Central District of Shanghai before September 20th for collation. Also, after investigation, important matters concerning the competition and a set of competition regulations have been formulated and promulgated. Apart from the Wushu forms, which will be sent separately after printing, we are sending the registration cards, registration forms, and competition regulations together with this letter. Please check and forward this information accordingly.</p>
<p>Accommodation Arrangements</p>
<p>Regarding the registration, reception, transportation, and care of delegations from various units and referees of the Games, as well as various tea parties, this Committee has specially established an Accommodation Group to be responsible for handling them. This group has negotiated with the China Travel Service to facilitate the reception of delegations and referees. As the opening date is approaching, the accommodation arrangements are recorded below. Please pay attention to them.</p>
<p>(1) Before departing, please ask the China Travel Service in each location to obtain baggage stickers or tags for the delegations of each unit, and mark the name of the organization, the name of the person, and the location separately for identification.</p>
<p>(2) The delegations of each unit should contact the China Travel Service in each location in advance regarding train and ship cabin seats, ticket exemptions, and baggage arrangements. When departing, they must also telegraph this group with the train schedule, ship name, and arrival date (or entrust the China Travel Service to send the telegram on their behalf).</p>
<p>(3) When the delegations of each unit contact the Accommodation Group, the head of the delegation or their representative should be responsible to ensure that the matters are handled in a unified manner to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>(4) The large baggage of each referee and athlete can be handed over to the Accommodation Group for safekeeping. Small items (such as handbags, small wicker baskets, thermos bottles, etc.) should be carried by themselves.</p>
<p>(5) After the delegations of each unit arrive, the head of the delegation or their representative will hand over the large baggage to the Accommodation Group for delivery to the dormitory, and then hand it over to the head of the delegation or their representative for receipt. After the meeting, the same method will be used to deliver it to the station or port. However, the head of the delegation or their representative must be present to inspect the checked baggage from the railway during collection and delivery to avoid errors.</p>
<p>(6) After the head of the delegation or their representative hands over the baggage to the Accommodation Group, no one may arbitrarily retrieve or remove items before they have been transported to the destination and handed over clearly.</p>
<p>(7) After the head of the delegation or their representative hands over the baggage to the Accommodation Group, the Accommodation Group will issue a receipt and affix a label to each piece of baggage and send it to the destination. After the head of the delegation or their representative receives it without error, the receipt will be collected, and the responsibility will be terminated. If errors or losses occur due to the athlete's own negligence on the train or ship, the Accommodation Group will do its best to assist in rectifying or investigating, but will not be liable for other responsibilities.</p>
<p>(8) When the delegations of each unit arrive at the meeting, the head of the delegation or their representative should first report to the information desk of the Accommodation Group, fill out the registration form in detail, and exchange it for the Games handbook and accommodation pass. Then, they should move into the accommodation according to the number on the pass.</p>
<p>(9) The accommodation locations, rooms, and berths for the delegations of each unit will be pre-assigned by the Accommodation Group based on the number of staff and athletes registered by each unit with the Registration and Scheduling Section, according to the order of registration. Therefore, the accommodation rooms and berths for the staff and athletes of each unit are pre-determined and may not be changed temporarily.</p>
<p>(10) When the delegations of each unit leave Shanghai, they should notify the Accommodation Group two days in advance to prepare vehicles, etc.</p>
<p>(11) When the referees arrive at the meeting, they must first present the appointment letter of the Games at the information desk of the Accommodation Group, fill out the registration form in detail, and exchange it for the Games handbook and accommodation pass. Then, they should move into the accommodation according to the number on the pass.</p>
<p>(12) Tea parties and banquets for the referees and athletes should be registered with the Accommodation Group three days in advance, and the group will arrange the schedule. No changes may be requested except in special circumstances.</p>
<p>(13) The Accommodation Group will send staff to the Shanghai North Railway Station, the port, and the Games venue to assist the members of the China Travel Service in receiving, taking care of, and handling baggage.</p>

<h3>Qijia墩 Beach, Prepared for a Long Time, to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Located over 60 Li from Shanghai, Next to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway - Direct Bus Access - Official Opening to be Scheduled Later</p>
<p>Seawater bathing is not only beneficial to the body and mind, but also has a great effect on health. Moreover, in this hot summer weather, under the sultry heat, a bath in the sea is cool and refreshing. Since the opening of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach in this city last month, people from Shanghai have not minded the long distance and have been flocking there.

It is also only over 60 Li from Shanghai, with direct bus access, making transportation convenient. This spring, local people planned to build a seawater bathing beach to rival the Gaoqiao Bathing Beach in the north and south. Since the start of construction, half a year has passed and it is now completed. The internal facilities, such as dressing rooms, rest rooms, bedrooms, and shower rooms, are all complete and extremely comfortable. Cold drinks and tea are readily available. Rowing boats, bathing suits, awnings, and large umbrellas are all available for rent.

<h3>Ministry of Education Instruction on the Improvement of Private Shanghai College of Law and Political Science</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, on the 19th, issued an instruction to the Private Shanghai College of Law and Political Science. The original instruction roughly stated: "This college has repeatedly been given key points for improvement by the Ministry and ordered to make improvements. Now, according to the inspector's report, it is roughly stated that the existing school buildings of the college are particularly unsuitable for use, and the new school buildings have not yet been put into construction. The number of books has slightly increased; however, there are still few that can be used for reference and research. The president and key responsible personnel are frequently changed. Although there is a rectification plan, it cannot be implemented. The so-called full-time teachers are actually mostly outside the school, concurrently holding other positions. The enrollment of new students is still excessively lenient. Absenteeism of students and requests for leave and missed classes by teachers are also frequent. Classroom order is chaotic, and students do not pay attention to lectures. The teaching materials rely solely on lecture notes, and student performance is mediocre. The past undesirable academic atmosphere has not been corrected." After reviewing the report, the college still has not made improvements on the various points repeatedly instructed by the Ministry, which is particularly inappropriate. The number of new students enrolled this year should, at most, be half of the total number of new students enrolled in the previous year. All the following points are still limited to one year for vigorous rectification, in order to observe the subsequent effects, and the rectification situation should be reported at any time for review. 1. The construction of new school buildings should be actively planned and completed within one year. Reference and research books still need to be added. 2. Teachers should rigorously implement a full-time system, restricting outside concurrent teaching positions. The president and key responsible personnel should not be changed frequently without significant reasons, so as not to affect the rectification plan. This point should also be notified to the college's board of directors. 3. Entrance examinations should be conducted seriously, and the admission standards should be raised. It is better to have a shortage than to be indiscriminate. In peacetime training, emphasis should be placed on strictness. Matters such as absenteeism must be properly established with methods for strict suppression. Teaching methods should seek to improve students' ability to read Chinese and Western examination books, and cultivate students' spirit of independent research. 4. Training and management should be entrusted to responsible personnel for strict rectification, in order to cultivate a good academic atmosphere. This is the instruction."</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Wanlu)</p>
<p>Marriage is the tomb of love. If you can steadily be buried inside, that's alright! What's scary is that before you are buried, children are born. You need to raise them, educate them, and you'll be exhausted to death. That's truly hard to endure! I have no name for it, so I call it: "Children are the punishment of love."</p>
<p>People always think that the art of dealing with the world means that with friends, you can afford to be a little insincere, but with family members, you absolutely must be sincere! Actually, that's wrong: friends are formed from people who are originally unrelated. Only by being frank and open-hearted can you find true friends who will help you in times of trouble. If you approach friendship with insincerity, no one will be willing to share their heart with you. Family members, on the other hand, are people connected by nature. If you don't add a little worldly wisdom to regulate their pure innocence, then each person will act according to their own temperament, and it will inevitably lead to family strife. Within the family, scolding and arguing will be common. Look at Zhang Gong's one hundred tolerations, isn't it just about忍住 (ren zhu - enduring/suppressing) true nature and not letting it explode? Therefore, you should be sincere with friends, but insincere with family members.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Slits in Cheongsams</h3>
<p>— Jiao Xin</p>
<p>When men gather, they always use women as the subject of idle talk. Once, on a rainy evening, some friends came over, and the conversation inevitably turned to women. A said:</p>
<p>"The slits in women's cheongsams nowadays are too short. It's really inconvenient to walk, and it's as restrictive as a breast binder."</p>
<p>"That's right. Women are talking about liberation now, so in my opinion, the current short slits will soon be changed back to long slits." B agreed with A.</p>
<p>"If the slits are removed, exposing the trousers underneath would be a bit inelegant and would violate the conditions of the New Life Movement. It will never be changed to a longer length. Besides, short slits are really more beautiful than long slits." C objected.</p>
<p>"No, if we're talking about beauty, why were long slits popular for a while before? No one said they weren't beautiful back then," A retorted to C.</p>
<p>"Women's styles change quickly, and our perspectives change quickly with them. There's no set rule for what's beautiful. It just has to be fashionable," D said, trying to mediate.</p>
<p>E had been listening for a long time, and at this point, he coolly offered his opinion, "The slits will never be changed to a longer length. The reason is simple: the first condition for women's walking is that they must walk slowly. The slower they walk, the more they can sway and show off their graceful beauty. The shorter the slit, the slower they walk, and the more they can show off their grace. Which woman doesn't hope to be graceful? How could they change it to a longer length and lose their beauty?"</p>
<p>A said after listening, "Your words are very humorous. I can retract my proposal."</p>
<p>B also said in a humorous tone, "Since women only need to be graceful when they walk, wouldn't wearing shackles make it even more difficult to walk and make them even more graceful?"</p>
<p>"Aren't high-heeled shoes just shackles?" I said, joining in the fun.</p>
<h3>Success Story of a Beggar</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Under the overpass at the entrance of the alley where I live, there used to be a little cripple sleeping every night ten years ago. That little cripple was only about twenty years old at the time. At first, no one paid attention to him. After half a year, he left an impression on people, and they knew his name was A'liu.</p>
<p>His daily work was on the various bridges over the Suzhou Creek, pulling rickshaws and begging for a copper. Every day, he saved whatever money he got, except for the portion he gave to his uncle (the head of the beggars' gang). Fortunately, he ate leftovers from the rice buckets, so he actually accumulated some small capital in two years.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, he stopped being a little beggar. He used the few dollars he had saved as capital to sell some sweets and toys at the entrances of various elementary schools. He actually earned some money in three years, so he set up a stall selling sweets, toys, stationery, and so on. Another three years passed, and that was the year before last. He suddenly rented a storefront and opened a small general store selling cigarettes, oil, wine, stationery, sweets, and everything else. Because of his good credit, all the stores were willing to sell him goods on credit. At the same time, because he treated people very kindly, everyone was happy to do business with him.</p>
<p>By last summer, he had actually accumulated some money in the store besides his living expenses, so he simply bought the building and became a second landlord. And at the end of last year, he cohabited with a newly widowed woman.</p>
<p>Those of us who watched him climb up are all full of admiration for him. At the same time, he doesn't shy away from talking about his past. When he has nothing to do, he still talks about his struggle.</p>
<h3>His Righteous Friend</h3>
<p>— Tian Ji</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 16: Cheap curtains hide teardrops, hard to escape cold eyes; lucky men flaunt fine clothes, once reaching for power.</p>
<p>Jiefu didn't need Chu to lead the way; he went into his house first. He said as he walked, "Brides are always a little shy. However, when she heard that I was about to get a job, she smiled at me, as if congratulating me." Because Zhiqian knew he had already walked into the house, he let him sit down, poured a cup of tea, and passed him a cigarette. Only then did he take off his hat and coat, placing them on the side table. He laughed, "Meeting a superior is a happy thing, but it's also a bitter thing. If you don't see him, how can you get a job? But actually going to see him, that restraint is beyond words. Sigh! It's hard to be an official." As he spoke, he looked very regretful. He lowered his head and saw a cigarette on the table. He laughed, "The discipline in the yamen is very correct now. Everyone talks about the New Life Movement, and they don't prepare cigarettes for guests, just a cup of tea. I think that's right, it saves a lot of money in a year. For example, today I went to see Director Gao, it was to ask him for a job. No matter how presumptuous I am, I can't smoke in front of him, so why prepare cigarettes? Today, when I went to the Construction and Finance Bureaus, there were no cigarettes. The Finance Bureau didn't even offer tea, just plain boiled water, which shows that they're paying attention to hygiene." As he spoke, he unconsciously put the cigarette in his mouth, lit it, and began to smoke. Zhiqian sat diagonally across from him, looked at him, and said, "If Mr. Zhang becomes the director in the future, will you smoke or not?" As he said this, he smiled and looked at Jiefu. (270)</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Imperial Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When she heard this, she immediately became furious. She sent a eunuch to summon all seven court ladies into the palace and said to them in a stern voice:</p>
<p>"This is outrageous! Who dares to fool around with Der Ling? She advised me not to go for a walk in the long corridor, that was her good intention. How could I not know? Why did you discuss her behind her back! From now on, no one is allowed to do this! If anyone dares to mention the word 'beheading' again, I will investigate and send them to be beheaded! Everyone must remember this, and if you violate it again, you will not be forgiven!... Now get out!"</p>
<p>The seven people retreated in fear, but I still didn't dare to be completely relieved, so I asked again:</p>
<p>"Then, will this servant really not be beheaded? Your Majesty."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Of course not!" The Empress Dowager laughed, "Now you don't have to worry anymore! Heaven has given people all kinds of knowledge, and we should naturally let them use it as much as possible, as long as it's appropriate! However, according to the customs and general rules of the imperial family, your behavior just now could indeed be considered a crime of defying the decree; if you were really going to be punished, then your head might really be chopped off!"</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Benevolence and Justice</p>
<p>On this morning, the Empress Dowager, as usual, gathered her officials in a large hall and held the morning court ceremony. After the officials had paid their respects, Prince Qing, who was in charge of important military affairs, stepped forward and reported:</p>
<p>"Regarding the investigation of the Guangdong Governor, Minister So-and-so, this servant received a very detailed report yesterday! The fourteen accusations made against him in the public petitions from the people of Guangdong Province have been found to be completely true. The people whom Your Majesty sent to investigate this case have all sent reports confirming his crimes. This servant dares not conceal anything and should submit the entire case file for your Majesty's review, awaiting your holy decision..." (370)</p>
<h3>Interesting Stories of "Rare Surnames"</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Last night, the traveler Tian Shulan, who had traveled all over the two Guang provinces, visited me. What he talked about, about the rare surnames of the Guangxi people, was very interesting.</p>
<p>"One day," he said, "I was flipping through a local gazetteer, and I saw records of the "big surnames," "famous surnames," and "rare surnames" of Guangxi. The first two items didn't attract much attention, but the last item had two strange surnames. That is, some people use the word "pig's anus" (豬䏽) as their surname..."</p>
<p>"That's naturally interesting, but when I think about how many people are surnamed 牛 (niu - cow) or 馬 (ma - horse), it doesn't seem so surprising," I said.</p>
<p>"The strangest thing is that some people are surnamed "Shit" (屎). Shit, look at this filthy word!"</p>
<p>"That's too wonderful!"</p>
<p>"I also met a Guangxi person surnamed "Nai" (乃) there. I mentioned this in my "Guangxi Travelogue": the other day, the publishing house printing my book sent the proof copy, and the proofreader added an ear "?" next to the word "Nai," indicating that he doubted whether there was anyone in the world surnamed "Nai." I changed the "?" to a "." (period). There's no need to doubt, I did meet a Mr. Nai in Guangxi."</p>
<p>"These are all not found in the 'Hundred Family Surnames.'"</p>
<p>"No, no!"</p>
<p>"Therefore, if you only use books to compare with worldly affairs, you will often fall into 'bookishness.'" I said.</p>
<h3>Women's Words</h3>
<p>— (Wan)</p>
<p>In parks or quiet streets, there are often groups of men pointing and gossiping, even pulling and pushing you. If you scold them, they will become even more proud and make all kinds of shameless gestures. If you slap them, they will laugh and say, "Do it again." This is the ugliness of urban men.</p>
<p>In funeral processions, you can also often see a few oily and lecherous faces.</p>
<p>The most poisonous thing in the world is the heart of a playboy, and the most despicable thing is a married man seducing a young girl's love.</p>
<p>Short Stories</p>
<h3>Mother and Plum Sauce</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was the season for hot plums, and ripe plums were on the market. A relative suddenly sent me a jar of specially made plum sauce, which made me both grateful and happy! This stuff is made by cooking ripe plums, rose petals, and sugar, and it's more sweet than sour, with an extremely exquisite flavor. I hadn't tasted it in many years. It also evoked some small memories from when I was seven or eight years old—a little before my mother passed away at ten.</p>
<p>My mother's love for us was meticulous, and I will always remember it! My mother could make excellent plum sauce. Whenever the hot plum season arrived, she would always make a lot of plum sauce to give as gifts to relatives and neighbors. Our own family would always keep several jars, mostly to provide for my younger siblings and me to eat as snacks. Every evening, after we were dismissed from the private school, we would return to the inner room. Each of us would recite the day's new lessons in front of our mother. If we could recite them, we would get to eat plum sauce, which she would feed to our mouths. This was the "old, regular rule" set by my mother. When I was little, I wasn't too dull. I could memorize three or four lines of the Analects and Mencius after reading the new lessons three or five times, so I could reliably get plum sauce according to this rule.</p>
<p>However, like other children, I was never satisfied. The flavor of the plum sauce really suited my sweet and sour palate. I always felt it wasn't enough to eat it just once a day, so I would use my little tricks, often suddenly shouting that I was hungry. This was such an important matter. Mothers all over the world, hearing their own children repeatedly shout that they were hungry, all recognized how harmful this would be to their children's health and would definitely try to remedy it immediately without hesitation! So my mother was no exception, and she would always inquire diligently. I would take the opportunity to ask, "Can I eat some plum sauce? I'm not very hungry." In this way, I often achieved my goal of eating more plum sauce.</p>
<p>However, a child's excessive greed will eventually be recognized by adults. Sometimes, not long after eating a full meal, I would use my usual trick of shouting that I was hungry in front of my mother, but she would realize that this was a time when I couldn't possibly be hungry. She would then ask me, "How can you be hungry? Where did the hunger come from?" Forced to this point, I would honestly and bluntly reply, "I'm hungry for plum sauce..." Isn't that a pitifully foolish thing to say? Such unreasonable words, if spoken in society, would be guaranteed to be dismissed and might even earn mocking reactions. But at that time, under the all-forgiving smile of my mother, I often unexpectedly got to eat some plum sauce!</p>
<p>Isn't it so? My mother's great love, even though my life received it for a shorter time than others, I, Dong Zi, can never forget it, especially when this ripe plum season comes!</p>

<h3>Supply Exceeds Demand: Spot Premium Drops Continuously</h3>
<p>—Closes at 1 Jiao 8 Fen—</p>
<p>Since the government explicitly ordered relief loans and the import of silver has been confirmed, it is expected that the situation will definitely be restored in the future. Therefore, most bullish parties want to sell off at this time to change their original intention of storing without borrowing, which has changed the situation in the market, resulting in sufficient spot premium, supply exceeding demand, and a rapid downward trend in spot premium. The opening fell by 2 jiao 3 fen, making 3 jiao 2 fen, and the market continued to fall by 1 jiao 2 fen, changing to 2 jiao. As a result, it fell another 2 fen at the close, changing to 1 jiao 8 fen. Compared with the previous market, it has fallen by as much as 3 jiao 7 fen in a short period of time, which can also be said to be beyond expectations. The foreign exchange market is still the same as before. The early and noon were both 2 jiao. The transaction of exchange tickets was more than 2.2 million in the early market, more than 300,000 in the new transaction, more than 400,000 in the noon transaction, more than 800,000 in the small general association, and more than 800,000 in the foreign mortgage transaction, with more than 600,000 newly made. The transaction of banknotes was more than 600,000 recovered, more than 800,000 circulating notes issued, more than 400,000 secret notes, more than 600,000 exchange drafts from various routes, 1.2 million sources of passenger routes, 200,000 to the stomach, news of bank settlement, foreign banks settled more than 1.8 million ticket drafts, more than 3.1 million various miscellaneous loans, more than 600,000 special exchange frauds, more than 900,000 foreign exchange settlements, 300,000 out of the warehouse, Chinese banks settled more than 2.5 million ticket drafts, more than 3.7 million various miscellaneous loans, more than 500,000 special exchange drafts, more than 800,000 foreign exchange settlements, 400,000 into the warehouse, Japanese banks settled more than 2.3 million ticket drafts, more than 3.9 million various miscellaneous loans, more than 800,000 special exchange drafts, more than 600,000 foreign exchange settlements, 300,000 into the warehouse, Qianzhuang foreign public list settled more than 39 million, foreign premium loans settled more than 5.2 million, and 400,000 in cash. Yesterday's Jiangnan small silver was 836 yuan in the morning and noon, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction was made 5,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small silver was good 1 yuan in the early market, making 737 yuan, and fell back 3 jiao in the noon market, changing to 736 yuan 7 jiao, so the result still rose 7 jiao. The transaction was made 260,000 jiao in the early market and 115,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were made 342,000 articles, 200 articles more than the previous market, and the transaction amount was 47,880 strings, equivalent to 14,000 yuan in foreign currency. In addition, the total number of clearing of notes in this city was 8,767,024 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen in silver dollars, including 3,886,732 yuan and 5 jiao in the total number of clearing of silver dollars, 3,243,498 yuan and 0.01 fen in the exchange of silver dollars, 1,636,794 yuan and 3 jiao 2 fen in the total amount collected by the money industry, and none in the foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Securities: 96 Stages a Unique Rise, Bullish Crowd and Remaining Bonds All Show Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the Chinese Securities Exchange Nos. 48 and 53 were still trying their best to raise the market, the market situation actually declined due to the crowded bullish players. The news in the environment was extremely conflicting. The bullish players took the hope of establishing a loan guarantee of 10 million gold as their only goal. Many turned from short to long, and No. 53 and others represented the financial community, which was one example. However, most of their buyers were forward-looking, so the number of floating longs in this month did not decrease, but increased instead. The short players believed that the financial situation was exhausted and disasters were frequent. The most noteworthy thing was that the major players were hedging, and due to their strong strength, they could not roll over their positions, and judging from the market price, they could not roll over their positions either. There was not much time left for trading this month, and if there were no new changes, the bullish players would inevitably be squeezed. Therefore, there would be drastic changes next week. Although there were only two sessions of trading yesterday, the opening plummeted by several jiao to one yuan. The second session was relatively stable, but after 96 broke through the 10-yuan mark, it actually closed at the highest price of 10 yuan 0.5 jiao. It is not difficult for discerning people to know the inside story of whether the bullish players have any effect. Flatterers and others used reorganization as propaganda, sparing no effort to describe the situation vividly. In total, the result of the market price was a uniform decline of 3-5 jiao to more than one yuan, while 96 alone rose by 4 jiao to 6 jiao. The total transaction volume was 18,165,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Trading Very Active</p>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market rose yesterday (18th), and trading was very active, mainly due to the following reasons: (1) The news of the real estate industry is very good, and the income of electricity is better than any period since 1931. (2) The subscription of public bonds of the Ministry of Finance exceeds the issuance. (3) Rumors that the American Steel Corporation may pay a part of the accumulated dividends of preferred stocks. (4) Although housing construction is only 14% of the total in 1929, it has increased by 51% compared with last year. The bond market and small exchange stocks also rose, and the total transaction volume was 1.5 million shares throughout the day. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers - Marked Yarn Advances by Leaps and Bounds</h3>
<p>The yarn market strides forward, with continuous price increases. After a significant drop, any rebound is difficult to stop. Furthermore, spot yarn sales are continuous, and the chip goods in yarn warehouses are selling increasingly well due to their low prices. The near-term marked yarn is experiencing even stronger upward pressure. If customer sales continue to follow, the August contract may reach 170 yuan.</p>
<p>Strongest Yarn Price Increase in the Near Term</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn pre-market, the near-month price increases were particularly sharp due to good spot yarn sales, with many purchasing chip goods from the exchange. Thus, the near-month marked yarn price increase was especially strong, but the far-month situation was slightly weaker. There were rumors in the market that foreign firms would dump far-month contracts again, but a check of the exchange records showed no selling. During the first two or three rounds of bidding, the Hunan and Guangdong groups showed strong buying interest, and some even switched from short to long positions on marked yarn, resulting in a favorable market situation. As a result, the near-month contracts increased by 2.20 yuan to 1.60 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, with the others rising by 0.36, 0.07, and 0.09 yuan. Sales included 350 bales of Dafu, 400 bales of Yukang, 1,250 bales of Daji, 450 bales of Yuanda, 400 bales of Minghua, 1,400 bales of Gengfeng, 800 bales of Ruid, 400 bales of Senkang, 400 bales of Yuanyi, 400 bales of Changfeng, 650 bales of Dachang, and 400 bales of Yongchang. Purchases included 600 bales of Tongji, 1,650 bales of Yida, 500 bales of Suilong, 550 bales of Junchang, 1,100 bales of Changyu, 1,050 bales of Shenji, 550 bales of Renfeng, 600 bales of Yichang, and 550 bales of Xinhua. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Account Balance</p>
<p>July Contract　166.0　164.8　166.0　Up 2.20　15,800</p>

<p>December Contract　170.5　170.0　170.4　Up 0.60　17,400</p>
<p>Total　191,650</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Purchases Remain Active</p>
<p>Spot yarn consumption remains good. Statistics show that all groups bought a total of 2,358 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by more than 1 yuan. Over 400 bales of Japanese yarn were traded. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin　25　Changsha　280　Haizhou　40</p>
<p>Guangdong　170　Henan　233　Xiamen　5</p>
<p>Guangzhou　60　Inland　430　Xuzhou　20</p>

<h3>Severe Short Squeeze on Old Cotton</h3>
<p>The price of old cotton continues its strong upward trend, and the concept of a short squeeze is deeply rooted. Most floating traders without goods are in a state of panic, and many are painfully covering their positions. However, spot cotton consumption has not been enthusiastic. Furthermore, the prices of Shantou and Chaozhou cotton have risen, reaching beyond 2 yuan. As for new cotton from the Han region, there is extreme bullish sentiment because the floods in Hubei have damaged the cotton crop. Those holding tightly refuse to release their holdings.</p>
<p>New Cotton's Continuous Rise Triggers Short Selling</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton pre-market, the prices for the July and August contracts rose sharply due to an unusually strong atmosphere of a short squeeze. However, when bidding reached the far-month contracts, although the Han groups bought vigorously, the price of new cotton approached the 3 yuan mark, prompting some speculators to short the market. Another theory is that after rising for four or five consecutive days, with increases of 1 to 2 yuan, a correction was possible, and those who had caught the wind also sold. As a result, the market became looser. The overseas American and Indian cotton markets were also flat, and the marked gold was also small. As a result, the near-month contracts increased by 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while the far-month contracts fell by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. Sales included 3,700 dan of Dafu, 2,500 dan of Tongfu, 2,000 dan of Tongji, 1,400 dan of Yuanda, 2,800 dan of Hexing, 1,500 dan of Taixing, 1,000 dan of Shenchang, 6,400 dan of Runkang, 1,100 dan of Yongchang, 1,800 dan of Tonghe, 3,400 dan of Yuanyuchang, and 1,700 dan of Yifeng. Purchases included 1,700 dan of Jifeng, 3,700 dan of Gengfeng, 2,000 dan of Junchang, 1,100 dan of Tongfeng, 4,600 dan of Shenji, 1,100 dan of Tongxing, 1,500 dan of Guda, 2,300 dan of Yuan, 1,400 dan of Yichang, and 4,200 dan of Xincheng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Account Balance</p>
<p>July Contract　34.30　34.20　34.20　Up 0.25　67,300</p>

<p>Factories Actively Procure Raw Materials</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are gradually improving. Factories are seeing healthy yarn sales and are showing some interest in procuring raw cotton. The sources include 550 bales of Yao cotton and 350 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>No Strength to Determine American Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened lower, with declines of 2 to 5 points for each month. Trading was light, with retail brokers liquidating positions. Mainland groups and Liverpool all sold, but spot traders bought, and the market stabilized with limit-price purchases by peers. In the afternoon, due to hedging sales and a weak wheat market, the market trended weaker again. The uncertainty in Washington remains the reason for outside interference. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose and fell by 1 to 4 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 16 points. Indian cotton futures traders sold, and European exporters made slight purchases. Pingguo fell by 1 rupee, Aomula fell by 1 to 1.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.25 to 1.75 rupees.

<h3>Food - Futures Flour Trading Unusually Quiet - Only 130,000 to 140,000 Bags Traded in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed initial weakness followed by stability. Because Chicago reported declines of 3, 4, and 5 cents, and Canada fell by 4 to 8 cents, near-term sentiment dropped by nearly a cent at the opening. However, due to the lack of offers from factories for the far-month contracts, and no quoted prices for imported wheat, market participants were unanimously cautious. Later, there were slight transactions from customer groups, and sentiment stabilized. Currently, buying and selling are unusually quiet, with only 130,000 to 140,000 bags traded in half a day. New goods stalls, coupled with frequent floods and droughts in various provinces, have declined to such an extent. It is not difficult to imagine the nationwide economic downturn. If imported wheat can stop activity in the future, perhaps the remaining situation can be maintained. As a result, the current month to November were all down by 0.025 cents, and December was unchanged.</p>
<p>No Imported Wheat Hedging Activity - The Atmosphere in the Futures Wheat Market is Easy to Stabilize</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the contracts for each month were generally calm. Although imported wheat was reported to be slightly down, the traders who were selling, considering the high cost of domestic wheat, naturally did not dare to make offers. Moreover, due to concerns about floods in the north, the source of wheat may have to be reduced, and sentiment stabilized, which was not without reason. By the afternoon opening, the current month remained calm. After September, transactions became smoother, and because no inquiries were seen for the price of imported wheat, sentiment was quite good. The lack of imported wheat hedging makes it easier for sentiment to stabilize. As a result, July was up 0.01 cents, August was unchanged, September was up 0.01 cents, and October was up 0.04 cents. The spot wheat market turned quiet again, because major factories had no appetite, and smaller factories had little remaining. Middle and second-grade stalls had no transactions. Only high-quality Shandong Yaowan wheat opened with 2,000 bags at a price of 3.39 yuan, similar to yesterday, with a large letter of credit method.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat July 17th July 18th Fluctuation</p>
<p>September 85.875 84.375 Down 1.50</p>
<p>December 86.50 85.25 Down 1.25</p>

<p>River Rice Slightly Lively, Imported Rice Turns Around</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of local rice (from South Shanghai) to the various groups still only amounted to ten or so shipments (nearly 2,000 shi in total). The market situation was able to tighten. In terms of sales, due to the hot weather, it was not refreshing. The local street was ordinary, and the Qingdao group only continued to handle over 400 bags. Although the prices did not increase much, the prices of various thick glutinous rice and thin indica rice were slightly higher by several cents to nearly a dime. Dujian was slightly weak, Yangjian was sluggish. Bianyuan was killed too much before, and slightly accounted for fresh. Yinyuan had no market. (North Shanghai) The supply of river rice amounted to seven or eight shipments. The path for each type of goods on the market, white glutinous rice transactions were ordinary, early indica and thin indica continued to be sold. The appetite for Baiyuan turned dull. The market price for high-quality white glutinous rice stood firm, and middle and second-grade goods were stable. The price of thin indica rice showed no significant fluctuations, and Baiyuan was stable. The prices of other goods fluctuated slightly.</p>
<p>Imported rice turned lively yesterday, and the market situation also turned to a stable state. Because the price drop in the market in recent days was caused by households seeking to sell and sluggish customer demand. Now most of the households who wanted to sell have sold, and the others plan to hold temporarily, while sales have become active again. Yesterday, sales on the Yangtze River were strong. North China and the interior suddenly arrived on the market to search, and the appetite of the local street was active again. Transactions increased slightly, and the market shape immediately turned around. Fatigue seems to have temporarily turned stable. A total of 7,500 bags of Saigon rice and 2,000 bags of small ground Siam rice were opened and distributed by Jiujiang, Hankou, North China, the interior, and the local street.</p>

<h3>Review of New Metal Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The contents and structure of the new American metal vacuum tubes have been recorded in great detail in previous issues of this publication. Although this type of metal tube has many advantages, from another perspective, it is not without its disadvantages. This article intends to review the shortcomings.</p>
<p>Before discussing the main text, I must first declare that the following remarks are all from the mouths of opponents—originally, since the discovery of metal tubes, in the near future, manufacturers of glass vacuum tubes everywhere will inevitably be greatly affected. In order to protect their own interests, many have risen up to resist. Taking Philco as an example, it once spent 4,500 US dollars to publish a full-page advertisement in the New York Times attacking General Electric's metal vacuum tubes. The greatness of their sacrifice and the fierceness of the competition can be seen from this. This article is based on this, although the opponents' arguments are inevitably somewhat far-fetched and narrow, and cannot arouse scholarly research. However, there are several points that are not without considerable reason and deserve our attention. I will translate them one by one in detail for the reference of comrades.</p>
<p>(1) Although the new metal tube is known for its exquisite and small size, the same amount of heat is dissipated on the metal tube, which has a smaller area and conducts heat extremely easily. Its temperature is naturally higher than that of a larger glass vacuum tube. The higher temperature will not only shorten the life of the metal tube, but also affect the values of nearby coils, capacitors, and resistors. As a result, the most important lifeline in the circuit—balance—will be lost. Although it can be remedied by keeping the coils and other components away from the metal tube, the space occupied is not only not reduced in fact, but even increased.</p>
<p>(2) Due to manufacturing reasons, only simple metal tubes can be produced at present. As for the complex vacuum tubes that are widely used and urgently needed in the market, they cannot be replaced for the time being.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, in the same application, the number of metal tubes must be greater than that of glass vacuum tubes. In this way, the space it occupies will be even more expanded.</p>
<p>(4) Since the number of vacuum tubes has increased, not only will the power consumption increase, but the price of the radio will naturally be more expensive. However, the efficiency does not increase, which is very uneconomical.</p>
<p>(5) Glass vacuum tubes are transparent, and any internal damage can be easily seen at a glance. This is of great help to users and repairers. However, metal tubes cannot do this, which is also a major disadvantage.</p>
<p>(6) The sealing method of metal tubes is still difficult, and there are more sealing points than glass vacuum tubes. Therefore, the problem of air leakage in metal tubes is very likely to occur. If there is a slight leak, the vacuum tube is completely useless.</p>
<p>Although metal tubes have the above-mentioned shortcomings, these are all non-problems. They are just excuses to find fault. It is expected that they will be resolved one by one in the near future. At that time, the opponents will disappear and converge on the same path. According to general opinion, the old-fashioned glass vacuum tubes will gradually be eliminated within five years, and Philco will also adopt the new metal tubes within one year.</p>
<h3>Frequency Modulation - Mr. Armstrong's New Contribution</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>Mr. Edwin H. Armstrong is an eccentric in the radio world. The two most effective radio receiving methods, regenerative and superheterodyne, are the ingenious inventions of Mr. Armstrong. Recently, Mr. Armstrong has completed a new ultra-shortwave communication method, which is the "Frequency Modulation" discussed in this article.</p>
<p>The current popular method of radio telephone broadcasting is to fix the frequency of the carrier wave and change its amplitude according to the frequency of speech or music. But Mr. Armstrong's new method is completely the opposite; the amplitude of the carrier wave remains unchanged, while its frequency is modulated by the frequency of speech or music (i.e., the audio frequency). To receive this "frequency modulation" radio signal, a radio receiver that is insensitive to changes in the amplitude of the radio signal (i.e., ordinary radio broadcasting) must be used, thus reducing or completely eliminating the impact of man-made interference.</p>
<h3>Reflex Radio Receiver with Dual-Grid Triode</h3>
<p>— Decan</p>
<p>This machine uses a dual-grid triode to complete the reflex work. The triode part is used for high and low frequency amplification, and the diode part is used for half-wave rectification. Dual-grid triodes include models 85, 55, 607, etc.</p>
<p>The high-frequency signal enters L2 and C1 from the antenna via C4, is induced to L1 through C5 to the grid of the triode part, and after amplification, it goes from the plate to L3 and AFC. At this time, a part of the high-frequency current enters the ground through C6, and another part is input to C3 to reach the grid circuit, which generates regenerative power. At the same time, L4 generates an induced voltage due to the induction of L3. Adjust C2 to match L4, and then input it to the primary of T. to enter the diode part for detection. At this time, the low-frequency current induced from the primary of T. passes through RFC to the grid of the triode part, causing it to amplify, and then the sound is output from the plate through L3 and C8 to the earphones. This is a rough overview of the entire machine's operation.</p>
<p>When assembling, any of the aforementioned vacuum tubes can be selected, as long as the voltages match. C1 and C2 can use coaxial capacitors. Use a one-inch diameter tube for L2 and L4. L2 has 150 turns, and L1 is wound outside L2 with 20 turns, using 32-gauge wire. L4 is the same as L2. L3 is wound outside L4 with 50 turns using 36-gauge wire. The coils are best isolated from each other, otherwise they should be placed at right angles. Other components are noted in the diagram. As for the performance of this machine, because it has dual wavelength adjustment, uses a diode for detection, and uses regenerative power, the selectivity and sensitivity are better than ordinary three-tube and crystal reflex machines, and the volume is also greatly increased.</p>
<h3>Amateur Notes (Continued Second)</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>—About AC Hum—</p>
<p>AC hum is the most common problem with radios. There are many reasons for its occurrence, such as old vacuum tubes, faulty or insufficient capacity of filters and bypass capacitors, open circuits or insufficient Henry number of chokes, or short circuits, etc. An improper filament center tap on the power transformer is also sufficient to cause it, and this phenomenon is also extremely common. Although disassembling and rewinding it is a perfect solution, the procedure is too complicated (because the transformer is often sealed with wax, and the wires are thick, making it difficult to wind). Now, I will introduce a very effective method. Connecting a 0.002 to 0.005 microfarad fixed capacitor across the filament center tap and one end of the filament can eliminate the annoying AC hum. Of course, the side to connect must be determined by experimentation. Figure 3A shows the connection method of the newly added capacitor. Sometimes, an improper high-voltage center tap on the secondary side of the power supply can also use this method.</p>
<p>In addition, the transmission of high-frequency oscillation current into the rectifier section is also a cause of AC noise. Try adjusting the regenerative power of an ordinary self-made AC three or four-tube machine to the most sensitive critical point for receiving (i.e., the point just before oscillation) and you can find that the buzzing AC noise also occurs at the same time. This is extremely detrimental to listening to weak distant radio waves. Connecting a high-impedance choke or adding a fixed capacitor in series with the plate of the rectifier tube can reduce or eliminate it, as shown by L and C in Figure 3B. The value and capacity of these, the former is about ten millihenries, and the latter is 0.002 to 0.005 microfarads.</p>
<p>When using a mercury vapor rectifier tube for rectification, if this problem is found, the above-mentioned device can also be used, and the effect is quite good. (End)</p>
<h3>Small British Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>The figure shows one of a set of small vacuum tubes manufactured by The High Vacuum Valve Co. Ltd in the UK. Its shape and size can be easily seen in the figure.</p>
<p>There are already three types of this set of small vacuum tubes produced, a triode with an amplification factor of 16, a tetrode screen grid tube with an amplification factor of 360, and a triode with an amplification factor of 12. The filaments are all 2 volts, 0.06 amps.</p>
<p>When planning this vacuum tube, it was not designed specifically for receiving shortwave radio signals, but it is said to be very effective at short wavelengths.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Introduction</h3>
<p>— Li Maimai</p>
<p>Currently, there is a tendency among a minority of writers to emphasize "creation" while belittling "introduction."</p>
<p>Naturally, the emergence of this tendency is not based on any new development in Chinese society that is sufficient to disdain introduction. Rather, it stems from a lack of understanding of the relationship between creation and introduction on the part of a few writers.</p>
<p>According to those writers who belittle introduction, introduction used to be meaningful in the past, but now it is conservative and indicates a decline. I am very surprised by this kind of argument.</p>
<p>What? Do we not need introduction now? Have we exhausted the inexhaustible wealth and essence of Western culture in science, philosophy, art, literature, aesthetics, from the past five centuries? To be specific, are the total harvest of natural science from the fifteenth century to the present, the treasures of European philosophy from the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, the literary traditions of Europe from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, and the development of social science in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries all "conservative" to us?</p>
<p>Such belittling of the introduction of Western culture is completely incorrect.</p>
<p>To regard introduction as "conservative" or "indicating a decline" is due to a failure to understand the fact that culturally backward countries imitate culturally advanced countries. Generally speaking, culturally developed nations often point out to those culturally developing nations that follow them an image of their own future. Therefore, the introduction and imitation of culturally advanced nations by culturally underdeveloped nations often indicates that the historical development of the former is to reach the stage already reached by the latter, and it is by no means "conservative" or "indicating a decline." France imitated England, Germany imitated France, and our country and Japan imitated the cultural life of various European countries. Is it possible that these are all "heading down the road of decline"?</p>
<p>We must understand that in the introduction and imitation of culture, any movement that can become a trend is never based on the introduction and imitation themselves, but on the social needs of the introducing and imitating nation itself. A nation can learn something from foreign countries or from earlier periods of its own history, but this learning is based on its own needs.</p>
<p>For example, around the time of the Hundred Days' Reform, the Chinese accepted Darwin's idea of ​​natural selection as a means of adapting to the demands of the Chinese nation for striving and making progress at that time; the acceptance of naturalism during the May Fourth Movement was to adapt to the demands of anti-feudalism at the time; and the introduction of social sciences from 1927 to the present symbolizes China's experience of the French Revolution and the introduction of social relations into the nineteenth century. From this perspective, introduction is not only based on new social needs, but also plays a huge driving role in cultural movements. Who can say that introduction is "conservative"?</p>
<p>Let us now temporarily abandon the importance of introduction and talk about creation. What exactly is creation? Is creation creating something out of nothing? No. The highest principle of the universe is that nothing cannot be born from nothing, and existence cannot be destroyed. So what is creation? Creation is nothing more than refining and synthesizing the materials accumulated in human minds over many years. In other words, creation is based on the acquisition of tradition. Without the acquisition of tradition, there is no creation. But how can we acquire the traditions of European culture from the past five centuries? Then there is no other way than introduction. Therefore, opposition to introduction inevitably opposes creation itself.</p>
<p>We can only understand the difference between introduction and creation in this way. That is, when a person already has a perfect tool at his disposal, there is no need to bother creating a new tool. Only when this tool is not enough or not suitable does he have the need to create a new tool.</p>
<p>When Russia and Japan embarked on the path of capitalist development, neither of these two nations produced any special, great philosophers. The reason is that when these two nations came out to carry out ideological revolution, they already had inexhaustible philosophical systems and methods stored there for them to draw upon. Not using existing tools and instead engaging in extravagant talk of creation is something only a fool would do because it is uneconomical.</p>
<p>Although Plekhanov was not a creator, he was still a great man. On the other hand, what is the creation of writers like Zhu Qianzhi, the author of Revolutionary Philosophy? Therefore, I still advise those friends who talk extravagantly about creation to work harder on introduction at present.</p>
<p>I have this opinion: being an introducer with the ability to choose is ten thousand times better than being a mediocre writer!</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that it is necessary to fully possess the treasures and essence of various cultures of the West from the past five centuries in the next ten years!</p>
<h3>Review of "China's Banks"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>Written by Wu Chengxi</p>
<p>Monograph No. 1 of the Institute of Social Sciences, Academia Sinica</p>
<p>Published by The Commercial Press. Price: 9 Jiao</p>
<p>This small book is quite interesting because it is neither an ordinary descriptive book nor a first-class research work. However, it is a book that falls between these two categories. The author expresses many opinions, so it seems quite interesting to read.</p>
<p>There is currently no good book in China that specializes in describing Chinese banks. Mr. Ma Yinchu's "Theory of Chinese Banks" is too old and no longer applicable. Mr. Yang Yinpu's "Theory of Chinese Finance" contains a section on banks, but it is not enough. Mr. Yang is the first writer who excels at describing various economic undertakings in China. I hope that he will publish a "Theory of Chinese Banks" in the future. Before my hope is realized, after seeing and reading Mr. Wu Chengxi's book "China's Banks," although I feel that it is not very applicable, I still think it is worth reading.</p>
<p>The contents of the book include the evolution and current situation of the history of banking, the analysis of banking business, foreign banks, domestic money shops and domestic banks, a review of the system, and conclusions. The "Preface" states: "The purpose of this book is to analyze banks from the perspective of the national economy, based on the special nature of China's economic development, and to understand banks." I say that this book is quite interesting because this book has a position. However, this position—analyzing banks from the perspective of the national economy—does not require much material to prove, and can be explained very clearly in a few words.</p>
<p>The "Preface" also states: "The author's interest does not lie in the internal paper organization of banks or in various practical or technical issues, so he has not delved into them deeply, and therefore rarely mentions them in this book." I said above that there is currently no good book in China that specializes in describing Chinese banks, which means that there is no book that provides a correct description of "the internal organization of banks and various practical or technical issues." The author lightly dismissed it with "interest is not here." Is it a matter of interest or a matter of difficulty?</p>
<p>The author neither pays attention to the practical affairs and technology of banking nor talks about future reforms. His reason is: "The author believes that the future of China's banking industry can only be discussed when the entire national economy has a solution. Therefore, in today's China, where the national economy is fraught with crises, it is best not to pay too much attention to local reform issues, so as not to waste energy and make them difficult to implement..." These few words can represent the attitude of a part of the people who talk about China's economic problems today. I think it's wrong. If the reform of the banking industry cannot be discussed today, then the reform of other matters cannot be discussed either. Then, the reform of all economic undertakings in China must wait until "the entire national economy has a solution." I don't know how there can be a solution for the "entire national economy" when there is no solution for each industry? How can it be considered that "the entire national economy has a solution"? Since local problems are not valued, does the author have a solution to the entire problem? Isn't the author's writing of this book on a local problem "a waste of energy"? According to the author's attitude, he should write a "transformation of the entire national economy" that is consistent with the name and reality, and not talk about Chinese banks! The so-called "analyzing banks from the perspective of the national economy" ends up with no solution! Most of the economic essays in newspapers and magazines today are like this. The author may have been poisoned by this trend without realizing it.</p>
<p>If we talk from the perspective of Presentation, there are too many empty words in this book, which should be greatly deleted. For example, the first three paragraphs of the "Business Analysis" section talk about the source of materials, which should be deleted and placed in the notes, and should not be placed in the main text. The empty words in other places are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>If we talk about the research method, the sources of materials for this book are all Secondary sources; but in China, it can be considered a good work even if it is based on this kind of source. However, the "Monographs of the Institute of Social Sciences, Academia Sinica" seems to be one level higher than this. All true research works should have Solutions; although this book has a "conclusion," it is just a Summary, not Conclusions or solutions. Therefore, if the author specializes in describing Chinese banks, he can do without a solution. The author's original intention was to choose the easy over the difficult, but in fact he chose the difficult over the easy.</p>
<p>My criticism may be too high, but this is because the words "Academia Sinica" are on the book. If we leave this point aside, then this book can provide considerable common sense for people who do not understand the Chinese banking industry at all. That's why I say it's still worth reading.</p>
<h3>From Writing a Book to Publishing a Book</h3>
<p>— Qizhong</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>When you go to a bookstore to buy a few books, after returning home and reading them, it is rare to feel "very satisfied." Most of the time, either the content is not substantial, or the printing is not good, or the binding is not exquisite. You throw the book on the table and blurt out that the bookseller only knows how to make money and is unwilling to work hard in the cultural field. This is a very common thing, and there must be many readers who are like this!</p>
<p>It is undeniable that booksellers love to make money; because if they don't make money, how can they eat? Therefore, a bookseller who can make 70% of the money and promote culture for 30% is already a conscientious bookseller. Since his purpose is to make money, then for a book to be published, he naturally wants it to be published quickly and the cost to be low. In this way, it is naturally impossible to ask for a book to be completely flawless. Do readers also know the trouble of a book's success? Before a book can reach the reader, it is unknown how much brainpower and effort has been spent by how many people. I will now briefly describe the process of a book's success below:</p>
<p>Writing a Book</p>
<p>Writing a manuscript is the first step in creating a book, and it is also the most difficult one. Because the person who writes a book must have sufficient talent and learning, a precise mind, and a sincere attitude, and then he can write a good manuscript. Therefore, it is very common for a scholar to spend years writing a book, getting nearsighted and weak, and even crawling into the coffin without finishing his work. (It is another matter for those slick writers who write a book in one or two months or even a few days.)</p>
<p>The work of writing a book is so difficult, but after the book is written, it may not reach the reader's eyes, because it must go through a publication procedure. If the person who wrote the book has money to publish and print it himself, then it will of course be easier for it to be published; however, if you have money to print books yourself but you don't have a bookstore, then the sale becomes a problem; because if you ask a bookstore to sell it for you, the bookstore may refuse you because he also has similar works, fearing that selling your book for you will take away his business. Or, even if he sells it for you, he will pile your book up high, and the reader will not know that you have such a work at all, so naturally not a single copy will be sold, causing you to feel extremely discouraged about writing books.</p>
<p>Most writers are probably poor. Once they have a work, they ask a bookstore to publish it. However, after the bookseller receives your manuscript, he will use the eyes of a businessman to examine whether your work can help him make money. If it cannot help him make money, then even if it is a work that you have written with all your efforts, he will refuse it; conversely, if the manuscript can make him money, then even if it is a work that was pieced together by cutting and copying here and there for a few evenings, he will still welcome it very much. Therefore, even if a writer has a valuable work, he may not be able to publish it.</p>
<p>Now, let's not talk about this kind of problem. Let's assume that the work written by the writer has already been received by the bookseller and is ready to be published.</p>
<p>Design</p>
<p>After the publishing house receives a manuscript from the author, of course, it prepares to typeset and publish it. However, before typesetting, it must first make a design, stipulating how big the book will be printed, how many lines will be arranged on each page, how many characters will be arranged on each line, what type size will be used for typesetting, how to arrange it, and how to bind it in the future. Everything is designed in advance, and the type size is clearly marked, and then it is sent to the printing house for typesetting. If your design is not thorough, there will be a lot of trouble in typesetting and proofreading in the future; if your design is not proper, it may cause readers to lose a lot of faith in this book after it is published. Therefore, after receiving a work, the publishing industry also faces an extremely difficult problem in designing the publication.</p>
<p>Release for Typesetting</p>
<p>After a manuscript is designed, it can be sent to the printing house for typesetting. If the bookseller has his own printing house, then this problem is of course not difficult; however, if the bookseller does not have much capital, he cannot set up his own printing house, then there is a problem. Which printing house is he hesitant to use to typeset? A small-scale printing house not only lacks materials, but also has incomplete machines and unskilled workers, so it cannot print a beautiful book; most of the large-scale printing houses are self-established by other bookstores. They print their own books and have no time to accept your business; even if they accept it, they will keep your manuscript on hold, and if it is put on hold for half a year, it will not matter to them, what can you do to them? Readers, when you read this, you must interject and say, "Then find a printing house that is neither big nor small!" Ah, but how easy is that! Printing houses that are neither big nor small often do not have enough materials, and the results of typesetting will not be good, and every time a word or symbol is missing, it cannot be bought for a while, which can delay for several days. Furthermore, they find it easier to make money by typesetting scattered miscellaneous items than by typesetting entire books. The reason why they accept your business is just to do it when business is slow. When they have scattered business, they have to put your business on hold, and it is useless for you to be anxious.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume that the bookseller has found a very good printing house and sent the manuscript there for typesetting. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Banning Residents from Cooling Off Outdoors</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>In recent days, the weather in this city has become hotter day by day, following the rise of mercury in the thermometer. The general public is complaining endlessly under the intense heat wave. However, they must go to work during the day, and in the evening, everyone cools off outdoors. Moreover, many people spend the whole night sleeping in the alleyways or by the roadside. This is only for temporary comfort.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Public Security Bureau of this city suddenly took action to ban residents from cooling off outdoors. It is said that during this hot summer, whenever the sun sets, people can be seen lying naked to cool off on the roads and sidewalks, which not only hinders traffic and hygiene, but also does not conform to the New Life Movement. Therefore, the patrol police are ordered to stop them at any time, and those who violate the order will be punished according to the violation of police regulations. On the same day, we also saw a similar announcement from the Capital Police Department, which also banned residents from cooling off outdoors.</p>
<p>According to the Public Security Bureau, banning residents from cooling off outdoors is because it hinders traffic and hygiene and does not conform to the New Life Movement. The reasons are very sufficient and proper. It is inconvenient for vehicles to travel when residents gather by the roadside to cool off. And the crowd is crowded, the air is turbid, and it is easy to spread diseases. It is also unsightly to sit or lie naked. Such bad habits must be banned.</p>
<p>However, residents cool off outdoors at night for the sake of cooling off. In this hot weather, who does not feel the pain of sweating profusely? Except for a few who live in high-rise buildings with stone electric fans installed at home, feeling more than enough cool breeze, the class of poor friends is very critical. In a narrow room like a pigeon cage or attic, many people gather, and under a heat of 100 degrees, people's skin will be scorched black. And in Shanghai, it costs money to buy tickets to visit the park, and not everyone can go in casually. Swimming pools are even more of a summer resort for young masters and ladies. Although movie theaters have air-conditioned facilities, only the rich can enjoy them. What other places do the majority of Shanghai residents who live in this environment have to escape the heat in the evening other than the alleyways and roadsides?</p>
<p>Cooling off outdoors violates police regulations, but when thinking of the pain and unsanitary conditions of the general public being driven into their rooms or attics after being attacked by the heat, the health authorities must also feel compassionate and think of ways to improve their situation.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Kota Bharu</h3>
<p>— Lini</p>
<p>The climate of Kota Bharu changes from time to time with the monsoon. Like now, it is the season of the southwest monsoon, so the weather is exceptionally hot. During the day, the sun is like a flaming brazier, spitting out spicy and scorching light, roasting the tender green grass by the roadside until it droops listlessly. People are like drunkards, dizzy and confused; and as if suffering from insomnia, they are always dozing off. Once they lie down on the bed, they fall asleep like mud.</p>
<p>However, when the sun rests on the treetops of the western jungle until it sinks weakly, the dim color of dusk gradually stretches out from all around the universe; the light evening breeze, fresh, cool, and gusts of wind, flutter. At this time, the climate seems to have changed from "hot summer" to "cool autumn." In this "sunset is infinitely good" dusk, the scenery and mood of Kota Bharu give people such a beautiful pleasure, and a deep memory, nostalgic!</p>
<p>Whenever the sun sets and after dinner, I leisurely take a walk to the street in slippers. The light evening breeze sends a intermittent buzzing sound, like the low hum of flies, hovering in my ears. This is the sound of the natives' devout prayers. — "What instructions do these people, who have no conflict with the world, want God to give them?" I think so in my heart, and at the same time I find it a bit funny.</p>
<p>The life of the natives of Kota Bharu is the most uncomfortable and distressing for people: the low houses are about six or seven feet high and are covered with attap leaves with some rough wood and bamboo. Short steps are placed on the front and back of the house, and looking into the doorway from the steps, you can clearly see all the simple and dirty furnishings inside. Moreover, most of these houses are occupied by several people in a family—naturally, they sleep, eat, and defecate in this place.</p>
<p>The natives of Kota Bharu are probably the laziest people in the world. Sometimes they gather with several companions all day long, chatting idly, and sometimes they lie on the floor like snakes, falling asleep. When they feel a little hungry, they lazily stand up, run to the door, buy one or two packets of Malay rice wrapped in banana leaves, peel off the outer banana leaves, grab it with their fingers and put it in their mouths, or go to a coffee shop to eat some bread or curry rice. As for hygiene, they simply don't know what it is. Therefore, the many potholes around their houses are often full of sewage and garbage. During the day, the hot sun dries and evaporates them, spreading a nauseating and unbearable stench. At night, there are so many mosquitoes that it is frightening. If you carry a kerosene lamp and stomp around in the house for a while, many mosquitoes will immediately fly up, as if an all-out attack order has been issued, surrounding you and making it impossible to escape. However, I must also say that there are naturally some natives who pay attention to hygiene, but these are only a few people—some people in government agencies.</p>
<p>It is said that the women of Kota Bharu are the most beautiful in the Malay Peninsula. They have round, large, beautiful, and crystal clear, passionate eyes, plump faces, decorated with charming smiles, healthy colors, and graceful figures. These girls like to wear colorful, buttonless outer garments, cover their heads with a silk scarf, wear "sarongs" on their lower bodies, and wear embroidered slippers on their feet. Their limbs, necks, and ears are all decorated with heavy ornaments. Sometimes they also wear thick makeup. How graceful and moving they are when they walk. However, these girls are usually not seen much on the streets of Kota Bharu, except in movie theaters and other entertainment venues. They also stay at home all day long, like women in our feudal era.</p>
<h3>Father</h3>
<p>— Mo Jia</p>
<p>It seems like a subconscious thing. Seeing other young people of roughly my age all having fathers who could be endlessly asked for money to spend on pleasure, I couldn't help but silently, perhaps sadly, think about how my own father's wealth was destroyed. This destruction simultaneously shattered my beautiful aspirations and the idyllic environment I lived in. Because of this, I felt an inexplicable anger, I hated everything, but no matter how much anger and hatred I felt, it was all in vain. I had already truly fallen into the cruel grasp of fate. And when I once read a letter from my father, filled with the lonely words of an elderly man after a business failure, filled with sighs of world-weariness and utter fatigue, I was once plunged into gloomy sorrow. Then, my father's clear voice, which was now gradually becoming sluggish, those strands of whitening hair, that withered face, and the house, desolate after being struck by a storm, all together, floated in my mind like a shadow picture painted in dull colors. My heart began to tremble, my eyes gradually blurred, especially when I read the words: "Half a lifetime of hard work, all swept away at once; the whole family, old and young, crying out for food; and your father has little savings left. If this continues, we are in danger of running out of food..." Each and every word was like a knife stabbing into my chest, going straight into my back. I almost didn't have the courage to continue reading the letter. Invisible tears welled up in my eyes, and my vision darkened in waves. My whole mind and emotions became so heavy that they were about to solidify.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>But painful memories mercilessly rushed towards me!</p>
<p>I remember that autumn when the unfortunate news came that both of my father's shops had been suddenly closed down in a kind of accidental disaster. I felt as if someone had hit me on the head with a club. I was dizzy, and with a bewildered heart, not knowing what to do, I rushed back. Although we had only been apart for less than a year, my father's face looked as old as if we had been separated for a long time. He ran around for four months to settle the shop's affairs, but all the assets were gone. The cheekbones on my father's face became more prominent, his eyes sank deeper, and he returned with unfinished debts on his shoulders. And then he collapsed. I sighed to myself.</p>
<p>"It's destined in fate, destined in fate. We can only be optimistic. Qi'er, one's career in life must be built from hardship. I am old, you should not be discouraged, you must work hard."</p>
<p>My father usually didn't believe in fate, but at this moment he had to use fate to explain this unexpected disaster.</p>
<p>For the sake of the family, for twenty years, my father had always been working hard outside. He didn't come home often, and even when he did, he only stayed for a day or two before hurrying off again. Now my father had more time to stay at home, but this was not peaceful rest, but a sad predicament. Moreover, my father was a man who could use his energy to the fullest and had great ambitions for everything. Now, he could only be idle at home empty-handed. He must have unspeakable suffering in his heart at this time. It doesn't matter how badly a person is hit when they are young, they will still not lose heart, because they have a long future ahead of them. But for an elderly person, like my father, in his twilight years, when a career built with a lifetime of hard work unfortunately fails, this shock will fill his later years with a feeling of darkness and desolation.</p>
<p>Just as my father expected of me, I understood that the only way to bring him some slightly happier days from now on was through my own efforts. Yes, my father had suffered for most of his life, and now he was old and his career was ruined. Even if it weren't, I should take over the burden that was weighing on my father's shoulders and let him rest comfortably. So I left the dilapidated home again with a melancholy but also invigorated heart.</p>
<p>In these days, I often worried about my father's lonely old age, his lonely heart, and the difficult situation of the family. When I thought of this, on the one hand, I would often work harder, but on the other hand, my thoughts would become chaotic. I hoped to save as much as possible from my own life and send some money back to subsidize the family economically, so that my father could have some joy and the family's hardship could be eased, and that I could bring some comfort to my father's lonely heart. But several years passed in a flash. In the meantime, it was not easy to take care of myself, and there were circumstances that I could not control, so how could I take care of the family? I hated myself and cursed myself. My father had raised me so much, and I could barely stand on my own two feet. What beautiful dreams my father had for me! However, I hope that one day I will fulfill my father's dreams, or at least not disappoint him.</p>
<h3>The Used Book Stall and Its Owner (Scenery Essay No. 1)</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>In the corners of the city streets, used book stalls are scattered about. Several broken wooden boxes are crammed with many tattered, dirty old books, ranging from "Republic Textbooks" to incomplete copies of gold-embossed, original-edition complete works of Shakespeare. In between are things that are surprisingly mixed up: a couple of Zhang Ziping novels are placed next to an outline of political science; a brief history of movie actresses is arranged next to immunology. Just as the encounters of these books are bizarre, they all strangely share the same appearance of dilapidation and age, even though they are dressed in various different covers and contain incomparably unrelated content. They are crammed together, placed on the street, allowing many people with the attitude of "panning for gold" to choose what suits them and take it back. People flip through this one, flip through that one. Thus, these dilapidated books, which have experienced the world, have been transferred from one person's hands to another, have gone through many different lives, and have been read by many different people, become more rapidly old and dilapidated day by day. Those books that can never find a master, that have forever lost people's favor, can only quietly lie in a corner, recalling their past glory, using it to forget their present misfortune.</p>
<p>And those books are so much like people who have experienced the world and finally declined! People pick up a beautiful romance novel with a scarlet cover and gold embossing. Perhaps they can see that some still have moving dedications written in faded ink on the title page. From this, they can perhaps still imagine the purple feelings of the past? But now, the appearance of this book has been wearied and decayed by people's handling, and the people and events recorded on the title page have perhaps also faded away?</p>
<p>People stand in front of the book stalls, flipping through and looking; there are also some "down-on-their-luck scholars" who, having lost their means of livelihood in poverty, quietly take out a few tattered books and imploringly "discuss" with the book stall owner, hoping to exchange these books for a few coins to get through tomorrow; but the boss knows a little bit about psychology and pretends to be indifferent, buying them by weight. Then he waits to slowly sell them to another customer who needs them for four or five times the price, and that's how he gets by.</p>
<p>Someone picks up a book and asks the boss the price; so he first looks at the binding, thickness, and then looks at your expression, and finally casually looks at the title of the book (actually, looking or not looking is all the same); for example, if it is a thick, hard-covered, gold-embossed book, even if it is a sample book, he will ask for three or four yuan. If you say he doesn't know anything, he will not be convinced. "Don't look down on me for not knowing goods. I went to middle school when I was young, and I even read the sixth volume of the model reader." That's right, he can probably read the name "Shakespeare" and the title of "Robinson Crusoe" in a broken way. Based on this, he determines the price of the book. If people think it's too expensive, he will tell you that the book is good, the cost is high, and business is difficult - the buyers are harsh, and he also has to make friends with the patrolmen on the road, so expenses are high, and costs are high, etc., etc...</p>
<p>Really, in recent years, even the boss feels that running a used book stall is really difficult. He wants to change careers, but he can't do anything else; he is old, and worst of all, he is addicted to opium. Recently, he can't stop "red beads". He curses the world for being unfair, curses heaven for having no eyes: he has finished six volumes of the model reader, but he has no food to eat and still has to run a book stall on the street every day to make a living, and he still has to...</p>
<p>The more he thinks about it, the angrier he gets, the more confused he gets.</p>

"Happy Forest" "my heart permits". At the banks of "Lone Valley Orchid" we made a hundred-year promise. Until, "deep in the night" we return home. "Sweet dreams" are connected. The last meeting at "Songhua River". You said to me, "Little Jasmine" is a symbol. I attached a "White Orchid" to my chest for you. Then, "a fast letter" urged me to return home. "Rain Hits Banana Leaves" we were separated in two. I had to take the "Express Train" to go. "Butterflies in Pairs" to each of the four directions. Young man, return "South" early if you have nothing to do. Don't linger in "Wild Flowers and Idle Flowers". I am, difficult to part and separate. From then on, there will be no hate in the "Lonely" heart. When will the "companion" meet again? Until, "Lilacs Bloom Everywhere". "Little Painter" still not seen. Truly, "beauty</p>

<h3>"Love Sea Love Wave" Premieres</h3>
<p>"Love Sea Love Wave" is a masterpiece of American writer and director Edmund Goulding's life. Compared to "Enemies Riptide," it is a more profound, novel, and lingering romance creation about the issue of "sex." The love disputes of the characters in the play, the emotional stimulation of the battle between spirit and flesh, truly gives the audience a lot of enlightenment. The play is written and directed by Goulding himself. The leading actors are Hollywood talent Ann Harding, and the rising star of the Silver Kingdom, Herbert Marshall, who has worked with Garbo. Marlene O'Sullivan and Louis Hayward play the young couple. The story is about a female doctor who wants to use her strong "force" to influence a decadent young man, but ends up deeply falling into the fire pit of lust, and the failure of a girl's passionate love, which promotes her suicide attempt. It is now premiering at the Nanjing Grand Theater, with the addition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rarest masterpiece of five-color musical song and dance art film, "Grandfather's Clock."</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Performing Arts Institute</h3>
<p>Many people in the general film industry now come from the theater world. These people, it seems, have not forgotten their old careers and are engaged in theater work. For example, almost every public performance recently has these people participating. It is now heard that Lu Shi, former director of the Art Drama Society and Dadao Drama Society, and later entered the film industry and served as director of Lianxing Company, will also engage in theater work and will serve as the director of the Performing Arts Institute. The Performing Arts Institute is an organization for training theatrical talent. It is expected that after Lu joins the institute, there will be a general new development. It is also heard that the institute will be relocating its address recently and will continue to recruit students.</p>
<h3>Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>"Movie Life" Second Issue July will be published on the 25th. The content is rich, and the pages are thicker. It is many times greater than the first issue. This issue is a swimming special issue, with swimming poses, close-ups, life, feelings, and essays of every female star. They are all precious masterpieces. The text highlights include Miss Xu Lai's "Swimming in Summer," Miss Li Zhuozhuo's "A Day at the Beach," Miss Liang Saizhu and Saisan's "Swimming Pool and Dance Floor," Miss Bai Hong's "Swimming Sketches," as well as "Silver Star Swimming Pool" and "Sweetheart and Mermaid," etc. Each copy is still two jiao.

<p>The exterior scene crew of Tianyi's new film "Sea Burial" has arrived at Dayu Island from Shidao.</p>
<p>The filming crew of Tianyi's new film "Sea Burial" is working in the sea all day long, with extraordinarily full spirits, but when they return to Shanghai, they will all probably turn into African blacks.</p>
<p>"Sea Burial" will be fully dubbed, and it is planned to insert two new songs.</p>
<p>In "Sea Burial," Fu Baolu plays Huzi, Tian Fang plays Damao, Chen Tianguo plays Ermao, Liu Liying plays Dashansao, and Fang Bei plays Xiaojiao. Almost all are new faces.</p>
<p>Tianyi's studio is currently rushing to build the interior scenes of "Sea Burial." All props are specially made or transported from the Yanjing area.</p>
