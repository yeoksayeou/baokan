<p>英院外交辯論</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨晚下院辯論外交事務之際、外相霍爾發言、對華北嚴重之局勢、表示憂慮、謂中國天涯陰霾密佈、卽所謂華北自冶運動是也、日員活動之消息頻頻專來、近今日軍之行動、殆亦與日活運動有關此項消息使英政府大爲憂慮、故曾特命駐東京代辦以甚人之關注通告政府、並聲明吾人歡迎日本對其政策作坦直之公布、日政府語英代辦、自治運動純爲華人之運動、日政府因在華北有廣大之利益、故現正密切注視此事、或謂日本齊實施武力干涉云云、此說毫無根據、日軍並未因自治運動之結果而調入中國、卽平津戌軍亦低於原額、北京附近軍隊之行動、爲原駐長城以南的軍隊行動、日本於該固有權維持軍隊、所傳移動火車、卽因此故而起云、外相繼謂大局今甚混沌、惟渠信中日政府間現進行之談話、必罪使目前任何困難獲和平之解决、渠視此種事端之重生、實屬不幸、蓋無論其眞相若何、皆足使人相信日本現正施用勢力、鑄造中國內政之發展與行政之安排也、任何事件足以引起此種信念者、徒能損害日本之聲望、與妨碍各方所願日本與中國及其他隣友問相互至友好關係之發展、外相次述及英政府經濟顧問長羅斯爵士赴遠東之使命、謂中國財政日趨困難、中國幣制日形紊亂、使中國與工商界均受危害、似須覓得一種補救方法、英政府之意、中政府苟非獲有關係各國友好之合作、連同中國自巳在內、不能滿意解决其所有之一切困難、吾人依此觀念、乃决議派羅斯爵士赴遠東從事調查、而其他各國政府則未接受吾人之建議作同樣行動羅斯爵士寓東京數星期後、已赴上海與中國當局恊商而開始調查矣、正在討論之中、中政府因國內突起匯兌風潮、被迫取迅速之行動、於十一月四日宣布改變圓幣基礎法令、外相至是切實聲明中政府之取此行動全出於自動、並未覓取羅斯爵士之意見、英政府迄今所接之報告、皆表示幣制改革計劃已受各方面之歡迎、而於恢復信任已獲良好之效果、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下院保守黨議員史韜頓向外相霍爾詢問、謂「日本藉武裝隊伍之力、繼續向中國侵佔、似此情形、英國政府究將採取何種步驟、以保護英國在華之商務利益」云、外相霍爾當卽以書面答覆、內稱、「中日兩國政府、對於英國政府爲保護英國在華利益所採取之態度、均屬完全瞭解、至於中國目前情勢、尤其是華北情勢、自當由英國駐華大使密切加以注視、但至目前爲止、就史韜頓君所慮及之情形、英國政府尚無採取任何特殊步驟之必要」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">當前之中日問題 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 冉</p>
<p>在列國並立之世界中。任何民族莫不愛護其本國。設有一國橫遭强權之侵陵。則其國人之愛國情緒。必非常高漲發爲愛國行動。以與外侮相抗。當此時也。當國者卽欲對外侮隱忍一時。亦須表現其堅守民族立塲之决心。方可得國人之諒解與同情。此一淺顯之常理。亦可用以解釋當前之中日問題。</p>
<p>中日兩國並立亞東。誠所謂同文同種。有唇齒相依之關係。不幸兩國之近代文明。不能爲同等之發展。而有先進與落後之別。更不幸因世界局面之限制。先進者由於發展上之需要。非特不能扶掖落後者。且欲以落後者爲其犧牲。就另一方面言。落後之中國。在受宰割之形勢下。自不得不爲生存而掙扎。此民國以來中日關係所以日就惡化也。近者。遍世界之經濟恐慌使列强殖民競爭呈尖銳化。日本爲擴張其殖民地點。竟欲在武力威脅之下。另闢中日親善之途徑。此種親善不啻狼與羊之親善。我民族何能接受乎。</p>
<p>我民族在今日仍惟有掙扎而已。掙扎之目的祇爲求生存。凡不容我生存者。我皆當認之爲敵。日人輒以我國接近歐美而表示憤恚。其實彼旣置我民族於掙扎之境地。在我急而求助。固無所擇於遠近與東西也。日本果欲與我謀眞正親善者。此種親善必須建立在『彼此共存』之基礎上。此則日本方面首須放棄其歷來之侵略態度。尤須尊重我民族最平凡最基本之民意。卽</p>
<p>『愛護本國。』</p>
<p>民意乃不可抗者。此不僅鄰邦人士所當理解。卽我國當局亦當理解者。『順之者興。逆之者亡』固歷史所昭示也。北洋軍閥何以沒落乎。國民革命何以進展乎。政客軍人之甘心媚外者。何以輒受國人一致之唾與乎。其原因乃甚顯然者。國難愈嚴重。民意之力量愈大。當政者欲打開目前之難局。惟有順應民意而已。</p>

<p>（羅馬）此間外交家今日咸信、意相墨索里尼準備拒絕和解意阿紛爭之英法建議、禺氏認該協定爲不滿意、因其未能迎合意國擴充士地之最低限度要求也但墨氏準備妥協、故不致悍然拒絕該計劃、而將暗示願接受更寬大之建議云、（五日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據官方人士宣稱、英法兩國政府現所商談之意阿爭端解决方案、俟兩國完全商得同意、大約將先行提交國聯會、或暫由英法兩國外交部保存、在意國態度未改變以前、不擬卽行向意國提出、蓋就目前情形、意國在短時期內似極少改變態度之望也、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據「硬」報載稱、英國外部阿比西尼亞問題專家潘德遜與法國外部菲洲司司長聖岡旦最近在此間談話結果、業已擬就共同建議、足爲解决意阿爭端之基礎、此項建議、昨日已由賴伐爾總理面交意國駐法大使賽呂蒂、該報又謂、英國大約將於本月十二日、以上項辦法爲基礎、向雙方提議停戰云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）聞賴伐爾總理昨晚曾向意國駐法大使賽呂蒂說明、謂英法兩國對於意阿爭端、任疏解之責、故希望意相墨索里尼說明對於阿比西尼亞最低限度之要求云、又一般人所得印象、亦以爲賴伐爾與英國霍爾外相、現急盼意國在十二月十二日十八國小組委員會開會之前、提出答復云、至關於英法兩國專家所擬辦法、槪括言之、係由意阿兩國在不損害雙方主權之下、相互交換土地、惟據消息靈通者所知、則兩國專家對於若干點尚未能完全同意、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間半官式方面對於未來與意國談判之前途能否成功、仍懷疑慮、則以據聞意國大使格蘭第昨日訪問外務部結果、並未發現任何新因素、足以副一般人所望故也、一般人以爲縱使意國若果接受以英法建議爲基礎開始談判、但在明年一月以前、亦未必能成立妥協、蓋至一月間、阿國兩季瞬將電臨、而經濟制裁亦必於彼時開始發生認眞影饗、彼時意國輿論感覺此種困難、對於和平解决爭端、或較易於接受也（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英法專家建議要點</p>
<p>（巴黎）據「硬」報所知、英法專家建議要點如下、（一）意國在伊里特里亞境內劃出一條甬道連同亞薩勃港讓予阿國、俾建造鐵路、由該港通至阿京、（二）阿國現有界綫、將予修改、北部蒂格里省一部份劃歸意國、惟聖城阿克森則仍爲阿國所有、（三）南部沃迦登全省及其西地方至東經四十度爲止、均讓予意國、又東部唐拿凱區域及沃薩區域曁哈拉爾省之一部份、亦畀予意國、俾得溝通意屬伊里特里亞與索謀里兩兩地、使互相連接（四）上項協定、應具有意阿　方條約之形式、（五）阿國其餘地方之主權、仍歸阿國皇帝保有、阿皇得請求國聯會予以援助、但並非如以前所建議、必須請國聯會援助、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬態度殊爲冷淡</p>
<p>（羅馬）自外傳英法兩國專家在巴黎進行談話、業已獲有成議、足爲解决意阿爭端之基礎以後、此間一般觀感確已漸趨緩和、但爲時甚暫、甫歷三日卽復歸冷淡、昨晚英國外相霍爾雖在該國下議院發表外交演說、說明英國對意阿爭端所持之態度、但據本社外交訪員所知、此間冷漠之情緒、未因霍爾言論而有所變更、外交界人士以爲意阿問題之解决、迄今猶未購成具體方案、此與前數日所預期者相刺謬、是故問題前途益見惡劣、負責方面亦謂、霍爾向意國所提供之種種保證雖所樂聞、但其內容固早爲竟國所熟聞、由此可見英國態度始終無所變更云云、一般人以爲霍爾演說、字裏行問殆在表示茍欲開始任何談判、其必要條件厥爲先行停止戰爭、此在意國政府視之則以爲此種程序實無接受之餘地也（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>對意阿案態度</p>
<p>外相述及阿比西尼亞問題、謂英國在盟約下集體行動中已盡其完全任務、並繼續努力以求意阿爭端之和平解决、國聯各會員國幾完全一致、不顧犧牲、參加集體的經濟制裁、而各會員國對於英法謀和平之努力、亦復一致贊同、英法已明白表示、（一）工作範國以國聯爲限、（二）願及早與其他會員國分任特殊責任、（三）凡討論所得之條件、必須爲國聯意阿三方面所可接受者、國聯機關現進行經濟制裁、工作順利、時局無時不在專家委員會之視察中、如見實施中尚有罅隙存在、則當竭力設法以鞏固此共同陣綫云、</p>
<p>禁運煤油問題</p>
<p>外相復言及油禁問題、謂余所可言者、吾人旣在集體行動之整頓範圍中各盡其責、則在此油禁問題中亦完全準備進行責任、國聯在原則上已議定油禁、對於此種集體决議、任何一國並不較他國負責更重、此乃余當聲明者也、他日國聯集議實施油禁時、吾人準備履行其所議定之集體行動、近有人指英國油公司乘機獲利、余對此責言、願說明之、在過去一季中、意國運入之油確較前大增、但所增者、並非出自與英國有關係之公司、試以英波油公司而言、該公司運往意國之油量、在今年十一個月內較去年同　爲少、而所减之數、尤以八月至十月三個月爲甚云、</p>
<p>國聯精神行事</p>
<p>外相繼言及十八人委員會開會愆期事、謂會期之變更、不得謂爲會員國態度之軟弱、但不過予以積極努力謀取和平解决之機會耳、欲調和國聯意阿三方面之異見、或屬不可能、但英法欲在國聯開會前所有之短少時期內加倍努力、世界現亟須和平、英法以國聯精神爲國聯行事、决計再作謀取和平之大努力、吾人不願屈辱意國、或挫弱之吾人極願見意國在世界中爲道德上政治上社交上之强國、而能大有供獻於世界云、</p>

<p>世界原料分配</p>

<p>艾登結束辯論</p>
<p>國聯事務大員艾登結束外交事務之辯論、謂現有五十國願負不歡迎的制裁責任、此爲彼等切願覩一新時代誕生之絕佳證據、渠信集體安全制之日見鞏固、使軍備程度有减低之可能、如國聯經此次爭案而地位益見穩固、則將造成覔取軍備减縮與限制的妥協之一種機會、吾人萬不可坐失此機會云、至是乃官布延期辯論、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>藝術漫談</p>
<h3 id="c33">鐘錶的臉（上） <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 丰子愷</p>
<p>有一次坐在上海的街車中，偶然向一長一短的兩枝鉛筆的投影。這在鐘錶窓外一望，恰巧看見了某建築上裝着的的形式中是別開生面的。我當時一瞥所一隻大時鐘。牠的形式頗能牽惹我的注得的印象，異常新鮮。好似看慣了細眉目，使我當時在車中起了種種感想，又細眼的都市小姐之後，突然看見一個粗使我至今不忘，現在特地把那威想錄出眉大眼的鄉下姑娘。來。</p>
<p>記得以前在談論「新藝術」的外國書</p>
<p>那時鐘的臉上不用羅馬字或阿刺伯中，曾經看見過這樣形式的時鐘的插圖字表示鐘點，只畫着十二根粗而短的直。但是我在中國看見實物，這是第一次綫，好像都是一點鐘。但三點，六點，。我一見牠，首先想起了牠對我個人的九點，十二點的四處，望去樣子與別的前緣：約十年之前，我在學校當敎師，不同，好像是空心的，或者換一種顏色有一天對於看慣了的時錶的臉，忽然覺的。因爲街車匆匆卽過，沒有給我看淸得討嫌起來。因爲那十二個阿刺伯字中楚。牠的時針和分針，也是首尾一樣粗，有幾個好像在催促我上課，有幾個好大的直綫，不過尖頭上作人字形，好像像在命令我睡覺，有幾個好像在强迫我起床，還有幾個好像在喊我趕快上車，使我在例假日看了也不得舒服。於是拿出油晝具來，用Cobalt將錶而和兩針全體塗抹，又用別的顏料在右上角畫柳樹的一部分，再掛下幾根柳條來。然後用黑紙翦成兩隻燕子，粘貼在兩針的頭上。這樣一來，我的錶就好像一幅圓額的Miniature（小型晝）。有時兩隻針恰到好處，錶面也會展出很可喜的構圖來。至於實用，我只要認明垂直的是十二點或六點，水平的是三點或九點，其他的時間就可在每個九十度角內目測而知了。我作了這個玩意兒，一時很得意，曾經把壁上的掛鐘如法泡製，使牠變成一幅油晝。（這件事曾經記錄在我的綠緣堂隨筆中）。這個掛鐘現在還掛在我故鄉的家裏的東壁上。不過後來我又看嫌，早已把楊柳燕子塗去，現在只剩一張白臉和兩隻黑針了。我和我家裏的人，對於「沒字鐘」已經看慣，大家不要求註阿刺伯字。常來的客人也已不怪，而且會看。幾個目力銳敏的小孩子，還能看出幾點幾十幾分半來呢。因有這前緣，我對於鐘錶的臉的變相特別關切。這一天從車窓中望見那個「新藝術」式的時鐘，格外注意。但現在提出這話兒，要拿牠來證明我對「新藝術」形式的先覺。上述的玩意兒，完全出於我的好奇心和游戲談不到藝術上去。只是鐘錶面不註數字這一點，與我的舊事偶然相合，因此重題耳。現在我平心地想：我的辦法——在鐘錶的臉上晝楊柳燕子或塗——原是當時過於好奇，只堪自怡悅而不足爲他人取法的。但如新藝術所提倡，鐘錶臉上免除阿拉伯字一事，我覺得是值得商榷的，不妨在這裏漫談一下。</p>

<p>於是他們仰看天上斑爛的明星，俯聞脚下芬‘芳的細草，又靜聆蟋蟀的齊奏，羅勃忽又說道，「媽爾媽爾要許多時候才來呢」。</p>
<p>「我不知道造物爲什麼要有夜；日間不是有趣得多嗎，」南恩如有所思地說道。</p>
<p>「這是給人睡的」，羅勃打一呵欠回答道。</p>
<p>「那末你就去睡罷，」南恩使着性說道。</p>
<p>「我要我自己的眠床。啊，我恨不能見坦第！」羅勃喊道，他聽到小巢裏歸鳥的啁啾，更加深了他對於家庭的苦念。</p>
<p>「我不相信你母親會找到我們的，」心煩慮亂的南恩說道，她對於一切的等待原是不耐煩的。「這裏暗得這樣，她穩是見不到我們的。」</p>
<p>「那個冰房子是漆黑漆黑的，我嚇得不敢作聲，然而她還瞧見了我；所以現在不管暗得怎樣，她總會看見我的，」有十分信任心的盤勃這麼回答着，他同時幷立起來，朝那暗空遠處一相，究竟那個從未使他失望的救星有無一點消息傳來。</p>
<p>「我見她了！我見她了！」他喊道，勉强拖着他的一雙疲乏的小腿，奮力朝一個緩緩行來的黑形跑去。忽然地停了下來，然後旋轉身子，跌跌仆仆回來了，大驚狂喊着：</p>
<p>「不是，那是一隻熊，一隻大黑熊，」說了就把他的臉藏在南恩的裙裏。</p>

<p>恊興籃球隊集復旦健將、加以身材修長之徐亨任前鋒、實力頗强、在本季西靑籃球會中、首戰即大勝南星、昨二次出師遇麥令、賴開始時之一鼓作氣、獲分纍纍、卒以四十一比三十六之結果凱旋而歸、造成二戰二勝之偉續、</p>
<p>麥令陣容紊亂</p>
<p>麥令本爲西人隊中之佼佼者、過去聲譽、與海賊不相上下、惟本季以健將多人回國、舊隊員僅有皮利士、茂飛、萊文斯基等數人、替補隊員經騐較差、全隊陣容紊亂、而挪籃更欠把握、致上半時遇矯捷英勇之協興豐員、即一籌莫展、下半時內聯絡漸見純熟、予恊興以相當威脅、終因前失過多、仍以五分受挫、</p>
<p>雙方犯規纍纍</p>
<p>雙方因競爭劇烈、犯規頗多、麥令格力妃期與協興·翁仁安·舒昌格·徐亨·均因四次犯規被罰出塲、而麥令聲援者、復責難裁判不公、呼囂聲大作、實則麥令隊員動作過火、旣生硬而復欠淸晰、祇以失敗之餘、遷怒裁判耳、</p>
<p>協興先聲奪人</p>
<p>開賽後協興即先聲奪人、於麥令圍集擲籃失效後、即翁仁安首開紀錄、周達雲徘徊籃下、復四次中的、頓以十比零煊赫一時、繼翁仁安又加一球、麥令即大調人員、果有轉機、陶諾爾於徐亨獲得二分後、即遙擲中的、協興張錦詳又偷襲成功、比數乃爲十八比二、</p>
<p>麥令緊緊追隨</p>
<p>此後麥令攻守漸入正軌、「馬面」皮利士擲中於前、格力妃斯憑其高大身材、托入三球於後、追成十比十八、競爭益趨緊張、協興健兒、抱破釜沉舟之决心、奮鬥不懈、張翁兩衛復於守衛之餘、時出襲擊、丘廣爕居中策應、面面俱到、翁仁安以四次犯規出塲、未幾笛聲高鳴、雙方乃停賽休息、協興即以二十七比十五高居前導、</p>
<p>最後局面緊張</p>
<p>續賽麥令更見銳利、惟多次投擲、均過籃不入徒呼負負耳、陶諾爾得球誤傳徐亨、徐見機深人籃下、先得二分、丘廣爕復在塲左遙射成功、比數又成三十一比十五、麥令見勢不佳、努力進攻、左衝右撞、頻頻犯規、皮利士於獲得三分後、即以奪球心切、幾與徐亨正面衝突、幸徐深明大養、不與計較、乃得平安過去、迨三十六比二十七時、協興舒昌格被罰出塲、替補之黎運澤、勇則有餘、機謀不足、遂爲麥令進攻之目標、追至三十四比四十一、相差僅七分、形勢危岌間、除亨又罰出、幸餘時不達三分鐘、協興即改攻爲守、麥令志不得逞、祇皮利士得二分、總計全部積分、協興仍以五分獲勝、</p>
<p>兩隊球藝觀察</p>
<p>綜觀兩方球藝、麥令之敗、由於陣容紊亂、擲籃不準、恊興之勝、乃在全隊用命、尤以張錦祥·周達雲·翁仁安爲最努力、惟陣法尚少變化、宜多加研究、則海賊雖强、亦不難如願以償、一洗前華隊失敗之恥也、</p>

<p>祥根死了！這個消息是從另一老校役嘴裏傳出來的。</p>
<p>有一個髮髻上紮白頭繩的中年婦人，牽着一個戴素帽的孩子，老含着兩顆似乎凝固了的淚水，在門房裏進進出出。</p>
<p>男學生的論調：『誰叫他吃兩個湯團，四兩五茄皮酒，吃壞了肚腸的呢！』</p>
<p>女學生的論調：『死了丈夫應該穿麻，祥根女人却單單紮白頭繩，太不行！』</p>
<p>學校當局也沒人提起祥根的善後，據說屍體還躺在板門上沒棺收殮，似乎他的死與大家絲毫無關，不及動物園裏死了一隻猴子叫人悼惜和注意。這亦有原因的祥鮮根生前，人對他都沒有好感。</p>
<p>常聽見人家責斥他：</p>
<p>『借錢借錢，先前的沒還現在又開口了，你儘自去打花會，喝酒，抹牌，找着樂，像誰少欠了的的，你這人眞太不要面子，你每月的工錢呢？你眞是糊塗蟲，混蛋。老實說，下次再借就不行了……』</p>
<p>有一次亦向我開過口。他希望我考第一，得獎學金。然而，我畢竟還是使他失望了的，我手頭沒有錢，他自然掃興，我也不安。隔五天，他就得病死了。還是敎職員有點惻隱之心，隨意捐了幾十塊錢給他老婆辦喪葬。</p>
<p>『你們亦施捨一點吧，譬如……他活着向你們零碎借。』另外一個老梭役很熱心地向男女學生們懇求，也凑成幾十塊錢。老校役引着那紮白頭繩的女人進來道謝。他額上現出一陣黑的憂慮之色：</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>在二十年以前，也許是一個九月中旬的晚上，我們正圍着一盞煤油燈在吃湖蟹，父親却突然地放下了正在吃的蟹，用手背去擦着眼睛，臉色是那麼沮喪悲哀着，眼角是潤濕的。我們大家都驚疑着，已沒有一個人再敢把蟹往嘴裏送了。但父親終於幽幽地說出了一段關於蟹的故事來，他說的時候是聲淚俱下的：（下面便是父親吿訴母親的一段悲慘語）</p>
<p>「這雖然已是二十年前的事了，但我現在還記得十分淸楚，差不多像昨天一樣：現在我吃到蟹，就想起了這件事，同時我也就想起了那不共戴天的殺父仇人，—他現在就是故鄉的行政署長，握着全鄉權威的×××。我雖然也曾想過為父報仇，但可恨自己又是一個弱者，所以始終沒有這樣的勇氣：如今眼看着仇人喧赫一時，魚肉鄉里。然而自己呢，依然是一個落魄異地的流浪人……但每次看到或吃到蟹，每念及父親慘遭非命，同時更想到那殺父仇人的耀武揚威，除了自家哭塲，或暗暗地流幾回淚外，祗有自己慚愧，自己咒咀自己的命運，自己怨懟着自己太沒用！」</p>
<p>「我的父親是為蟹而死的，然而我自己也是為了蟹才流浪到這裏來，成了一個永遠有家歸不得的人了！</p>
<p>「本來我們原是一個漁家，數代以來沒有改業過，只是靠着水裏過日子，我家裏就有兩隻魚蕩，兩條漁船，還有十多畝浮茭皮。一家子除了父親終年以捕魚為職業外，有時母親及姊姊等也會去帮着搖船撒網的，我那時年紀還幼，所以只留在家裏看弟弟。</p>
<p>「捕魚的時大生產李節，每年只有一個冬天，我們一年間的生活也祇有看這一冬的收穫怎樣而定的，而平時的零星收見如捉蝦，捉蟹等祇好拿來貼補零用而已。然而我們這裏不論魚或蝦蟹，在蕩裏却常常有人來偷的，所以雖在半夜三更也須出去巡視，有沒有竊賊來偷？並且我們那兒　時却有個專門僱了幾個人，在這漁村裏竊魚的×××。他的勢力很大，所以雖然人人見他恨得切齒，但是誰也不敢去奈何他、祇有大家在背地裏送了他一個綽號呌「魚賊王」。</p>
<p>「獨有我的父親却時常要去和他碰一下釘子的，因此，他見了我父親也差不多恨入骨隨一樣。</p>
<p>「有一天，—是九月的頭上該是湖蟹上市了，於是我父親照例的每天晚上要去捕蟹，和察看蕩裏的魚秧。但當父親到蘆葦附近，便看見有兩條黑影很迅速地向蘆窠裏閃了進去：父親眼快，就追上去捉住了一個，一個給逃走了。父親一掀他到淤泥底下去，迫他說出誰主使他來偷的？他跪在地上哀求，一一都吿訴了父親，並且將偷來的蟹全還了父親，父親於是就滿足地放了他回去。</p>
<p>「第二天，父親父照樣地去了，可是到黃昏過後他就回來了。他無力地叩着門，咳嗽着，呻吟着，母親去把門開了，扶着他坐到床上，只肴見他一身是淤泥，他變手捧住了一顆心，口裏不住地噴着血，血，許多地方全沾滿了血，脫去衣服，身上顯着一塊一條的傷痕！母親急得什麼似的，哭着，嚷着的問他為了什麼？他終於原原本本的將一切情形說了出來，並且還說：</p>
<p>「「這夥人是×××派來的，我的仇人就是×××」</p>
<p>「父親在一禮拜後便因癆傷過重而送了命，於是母親帶了我，背了弟弟哭上衙門去伸寃，但是他們究竟是有脚路的，所以終因證據不足而沒有結果。</p>
<p>「母親從此含辛茹苦的撫育着我們，將一切漁產全賣了給我們生活，給我們求敎育，伊說</p>
<p>「「孩子們，把這碗苦飯丟了吧，夏天熱死，冬天凍煞，你父親為了這碗飯喪在强人手裏了，你們還是改了行吧！」</p>
<p>「於是，我們便這樣地踏上了這條生活之路</p>
<p>父親說着已經泣不成聲了，於是我們也就望着檯中的一大堆蟹淌淚，母親患是傷心得嗚咽了！</p>
<p>如今，當我每次看到那些鐵絲節裏和花缸裏，活爬爬的蟹，彷彿它們每一隻脚都在我心上抓着，爬着，使我這顆心難過，終於忍不住想起了父親口述的那幕悲劇——</p>
<p>當父親講這故事是在二十年之後，而恰巧我來寫這篇小說，又已是二十年之後，計算起來，現在離開這悲劇的發生該是四十多年了！</p>
<h3 id="c188">超外差機調整級較準步驟 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 浮萍</p>
<p>超外差收音機的調整綫路最複雜，共各級的本身週率，並不如調整高放式的完全相同，所以最初這稱收音機除了少數受過訓練的技術人員之外，普通人很難使用，自單鈕調整制發明以來，把多數調整電容器裝在一根軸上，這樣祗要轉動一個刻度盤，無論旋至那一點，收音機各級調整綫路，都已配合得十分準確。廠製收音機在出廠之前，當然都已缜密檢騐，但是以後往受到不幸的强烈震動，或是使用者的不愼玩弄把已較準的各級抵償電容器，及中放級調整電容器等，胡亂攪動，雖然這收音機的一切機件，絲毫禾曾損壞，可是已斷送了牠整個的命運，除非有高貴的儀器和經驗的技術員，很難恢復牠固有光榮。關於怎樣把已攪亂的超外差機，重復較準，實在是我們業餘研究者不可不知的一些實用常。</p>
<p>較配超外差收音機必需的儀器是精確的試騐振盪器（至少須包含中間週率及廣播帶），牠的製法一切，本刊已屢次述過，自無庸多贅，現在開始來說怎樣利用這試騐振盪器，較準超外差機。</p>
<p>第一步要較較準的是中放級調整綫路，中放級週率最普通的是175KC，但亦有465KC等別種週率的，在收音機背面或說明書上都有註明，如果中放級變動了原定的週率，病象就有如選擇性不敏銳，副波尖叫聲，重復點種種發生。較準方法，先配合試騐振盪器的週率使與該收音機所指定的中間週率完全相等。去收音機的振盪級眞空管，以試騐振盪器輸出「天綫」一端，接在中放管的控制柵上，（如中放管不止一級，則先從最末一級較準起），現在新式收音機，中放都用簾柵管，所以接控制柵祇須來在眞空管頂　的銅帽上：試騐振盪器註「地綫」一端（通常卽振盪器的隔離機壳），接中放管陰極。開啟收音機，這時揚聲器應發出一種尖叫聲，試騐振盪器最好用已經調幅的，否則必先使收音機中放級振盪方可。以一小旋鑿，鐵梗上包層絕綠紙以防與機壳相碰，生短路危險，伸入中放變壓器，旋轉其次級調整電容器的調整螺絲，留意揚聲器所發的音量，旋至最響為度。如果能有「輸出電表」來代替揚聲器指示，則更可準確。同法再依次較準前級中放，務使整個中放部份，完全與規定的週率相符合</p>
<p>中放級較準後，其次須輪及振盪級，這也是所有過程中最重要的一點。現在把扷去的振盪管可以揷上。試騐振盪器的「天」「地」綫頭，分別接在收音機的「天」「地」綫上。將試騐振盪器配至廣播帶高週率的一端，譬如說148OKC，然後變更收音機振盪級調整電容器上所附的抵償電容器容量，至獲得最大輸出為止。同時試騐振盪器須在廣播帶內多換幾種週率試之，因為振湯級和高放及第一檢波級的週率差數，不一定在收音機刻度聲任何一點上，都能保持者中間週率相合。如果收音機刻度盤指示的數字，已是配準的週率數者，對於較準這振盪級時，有極大帮助，我們祗須留意在收音機輸出最大時，刻度盤指示的週率，是否與試騐振盪器相同，便可决定收音機振盪級的紙償電容器較準了沒有。</p>
<p>高放級及第一檢波級是最末一步，比較也最容易，和較準調整高放式收音機的方法一樣，祗須把各級調整綫路的本身週率，都配至與輸入的訊號週率相同，揚聲器或輸出表便會指示最大輸出。這樣，完成了整個的較準過程。</p>
<p>假使我們沒有高價的一輸出表」，也可以利用千分定培表來代替，以0-5的千分安培表接在第二檢波管的屏路內，如果檢波係探用柵極負電壓法的（通常亦稱屏極檢波），收音機輸出最大時，千分安培表指示的屏流亦最大。如果檢波係用柵漏電容器法的（通常亦稱柵極檢波），輸出最大時，檢波管屏流的指數適最小。</p>
<h3 id="c189">利用單一綫圈的短波收音機 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 鑑</p>
<p>本篇所要介紹的短波收音機，是只利用一個綫圈，而能接收各種短波波長帶者。下圖所示就是收音機的綫路，因其構造頗為簡單，故甚適合於初學者之自製。各部分品的數值均詳載於圖中，茲不多贅，這裏單把綫圈的作法來告訴讀者：</p>
<p>取一直徑一英寸長三英寸之圓筒，在其一端離開半英寸之處，以二十六號雙絲包綫繞上十轉，這就是圖中所示的L1，其初繞之綫頭應連接於檢波管的柵極，而且綫尾須連接於第一tap。其次再在約離半英寸之處繞上七轉以為LN，其綫頭接於第一tap而其綫尾接於第二tap。然後又在離開半英寸之處繞上二十四轉以為L3，接於第二tap之後，再在反對方向繞上一轉以為L50L4係在L1與L2兩者之當中繞三轉而成者，其綫頭連接於阻流圈，而其綫尾則連接於檢波管的屏極。除了L5之外　各綫圈均繞同一方向，而其繞法均為密繞。</p>
<p>變最電容器如利用25uuf（最大）icuuf最小）數值時，則其所能接收之波長範圍：在l1為16528m.，在l1l2為25S38M，在L1L2為45S55M。</p>
<p>再生（或　回授）綫圈共有L4及L5這是本機最特別之點，若將這再生綫圈改成一個，卽郎如將轉數减少使其能在波長較短之處發振時，則波長較長之處不起振盪；如將轉數增加時，則波長較短之處，其振盪又過强，因此不能不把檢波管中的簾柵極電壓降低，而使靈敏度低减，故只用一個再生圈；事實上是不能實用的。為了解决這個問題，所以採用兩個再生圈。當利用L1或L1L2來收音時，則只L4有回授作用，如利L1L2L3來收音時，則L4及L4同時，當做再生圈來司回授作用。</p>

<p>三·流星羣對於電波的影響</p>
<p>一九二一年，畢卡爾氏正用着八百週的電波實騐的當兒，曾看到一個很大的流星，同時無綫電亦卽發出一大雜音，所以他推定這種雜音是由於電波受了流星的影響而起者：另一方面，日本的長岡博士也有同樣的發見。</p>
<p>那末這種流星以及流星羣對於電波的影響究竟是怎樣的呢？據日本長岡博士所研究，他曾對於地球經過流星羣中的時候，將能影響及電波之其他一切原因除外，而專對於流星所發生的影響加以研究，測定其收報强度，結果如第一圖所示。</p>
<p>（一）流星對於電波的影饗，如第一圖A所示。岡中O係流星最多之日，換言之卽經過流星羣中央部之時；在此流星數最多日O之六十天前，電波已經受了影響而發生變化：此種影響，於流星數最多日O之十八天後，達到極點；迨及六十天後，影響尚未完全消失。</p>
<p>（二）然若就普通一般流星羣而言，其影響的起伏，有些差異，普通如第一圖B所示：流星最多日O之六十天前，電波已受影響而發生變化，在流星數最多日O之二十二天後，影響達到極點，至八十天後影響始行消失。</p>
<p>（三）反之，若隔着大西洋而收德國腦恩的信號，則其影響恰恰與上述二例相反；此種信號反因流星羣的影響而變弱。這種影饗於流星數最多日O的六十天前出現，於流星數最多日O之前後數天影響最强，到了流星數最多日O八十天後始形消失。如第一圖C所示。</p>
<p>四·星宿對於電波的影饗</p>
<p>流星及流星羣對於電波的影響已如上所述，那末普通的星宿和電波又有怎樣的關係呢？</p>
<p>星宿之能予電波通信以影響者，是前年才由伯爾電話公司工程師任斯基氏所發見的。</p>
<p>他一天在用着很長的天綫與一·四六公尺的短波實騐當兒，曾聽見了很大的雜音。他為着研究這種雜音之來源起見，乃將天綫改變了種種方向，結果知道了天綫向着某一方向的時候，其雜音也最强烈。這雜音最强烈的方向，是天天變動着的，並且漸漸變弱而後又再變强，經滿一年之後，換言之卽在恰恰發見了這種雜音之一年後那天，其雜音之方向和强弱適和一年前發見當時相同。（其一年中方向之變化如第二圖所示）於是，他推定這種原因在於地球之外，研究其影響最大的方向，結果，由天文學上知道這個方向，適為銀河系之中心。綜合上列諸種事實，他以為因種種原因，銀河系能回地球播送一種電波：這就是他實騐中雜音之所由生。</p>
<p>在現在無綫學界中，銀河系是否能發出電波給地球，雖尚未能斷言，但其能給予無綫電波以很大影饗：這是不能否定的事實。（完）</p>

<p>好壞的判斷：如聽筒裏發强大的「各各」聲的，表示這電容器完好可用；如發聲細微，成完全無聲的，則知是，漏電，短路，或接入綫中斷，換句話說，就是不堪應用。</p>

<p>戒烟非難事。難在戒期中病息不生。精神愉快。然欲達此期望。必先求一種補劑而能兼治各種病患者。始克有濟。吾人臨診心得。以斯丹那氏「生殖素」最能收確實之效果。而「生殖素」能早除烟毒。早斷烟癮。迅速回復壯健。尤為一般烟民理想中所渴望之聖劑也。</p>
<p>戒者梁寳華君。因身體衰弱。虧憊難支。服藥未效。遂吸烟以取振作。吸之多載。戒過數次。均以病患痛苦而罷。現因禁令森嚴。後顧堪慮。遂自投余處求診。余卽囑於戒烟期內服用「生殖素」。衰弱症患。盡吿治療。戒期內毫無痛苦。烟癮比預期提早斷除。尤為梁君所引為警訝云。</p>

<p>遺精。早洩。腎萎三症。其病源係因靑春腺衰弱而起。靑年患之最多。故醫家統稱之曰靑年病。罹之如不早治。則不惟能力漸薄。生趣消失。且身體神經。日趨衰頹。康健喪盡。毒命短促。</p>
<p>遺精之治法。以固精為先。當服希米脫氏固精片。若並服生殖素以培補其虧損。則尤為治本之至意。</p>
<p>早洩。腎萎。余除介紹患者至詹念曾醫師處用電波療法外。藥劑方面。主用斯丹那氏「生殖素」。因其挽回衰老。恢復靑春之效。確實偉大。對於早洩腎萎。能奏根治之功也。</p>

<p>人身器官。對於全身有分工合作之妙。若一部有病。卽牽動全部。如婦女之白帶症。不惟身體失去健美。幸福喪失。罹之者子嗣每歸絕望。良以膣內分泌之膿汁。含有强烈之　性。精虫遇之。郎被撲滅。欲求子嗣。奚啻緣木求魚</p>
<p>龔夫人為一美而慧之少婦。婚後卽罹白帶。美貌旣亡。康健亦失。柔弱多病。毫無生育。夫妻感情。大受影響。其夫有動於中。欲納妾求嗣。龔夫人始挽其舅嫂伴來余處求治。余囑購療帶靈依法在家自行治療。並內服女用生殖素。逾二月而瘳。身體既漸復原。美貌亦仍如當年。於是其夫納妾之議。不攻自消。是二藥者。內外交用。保全家庭幸福。又豈淺哉。</p>

<p>鄙人今脫離險境矣。回憶昔日。百病纏體。宛如身在虎穴也。然鄙人之所以得有今日。不得不歸功於詹念曾醫師及「生殖素」。</p>
<p>三個月前。余衰頹如垂斃待命之軀。今日則余壯健如生龍活虎之身。則謂「生殖素」為吾重生之父母。亦非過譽也。蓋爾時余以積弱多病之軀。百體虧損。所最苦者。腰痠背痛。四肢疲乏。心房衰弱。時起驚悸。冷汗遍身。似將虛脫。雖曾延醫服藥。未見减輕。徨論痊愈。幸余為本刋讀者。始知詹念曾醫師為治衰弱症及性病之能手。詹君和藹可親。診察不厭週詳。介紹名藥。治吾沉疴。誠當繡像膜拜。感戴終世也。</p>

<p>鄙人因患劇烈之咯血。致面色枯黃。形容消瘦。後咯血雖多方治愈。然因失血過多。致患貧血之症。一時無從恢復。所曾經試服之補血劑。約有十餘種之多。咸不能使余滿意。瘦弱如故。今夏因患遺精。蒙友人介紹至性病專家詹念曾醫師處。承用希米脫氏固精片治愈我遺精。當時詹醫師介紹余向永安公司西藥部購服「生殖素。」謂對於貧血衰弱有特效。卽遵囑餌服。連服數天。果見起色。因堅心續服五盒。現已氣血充盈。精神飽滿。衰弱症象。早已化為烏有云。</p>

<h3 id="c203">敎育局關心戲劇的改進 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>戲劇是一種社會敎育，其對於民衆的影響，力量很大。良善的戲劇，能使觀衆得到好印象，反之則足以遺害社會。然我國所有的戲劇，新的尚未成熟，奮的不但未能適合社會敎育的目標，且多帶有濃厚的封建色彩，或有妨碍風化。近來本市敎育局，對於各種戲劇，頗具改良的決心。前者見滑稽腳戲的勢力，深入民間，爲利用爲推行社會敎育的利器計，特派該局戲曲唱片審查委員領導全市獨腳戲演員，組織上海市滑稽獨腳戲研究會。蓋一方面可增進獨腳戲演員在社會上的地位，他方面使全體演員皆能切實改進唱詞，以收潛移默化的功效。結果成續很佳，往日慣唱哭王無能的獨腳戲，現在居然能傳佈社會敎育。日前該會第七次常會，決定改進獨腳戲的具體辦法六條。在消極方面，有四不准：（一）不准演唱猥褻詞句及表演，（二）不准有駡人的句子，（三）不准唱哭調，（四）不准演唱當局已經禁止的詞調及表演。在積極方面，有二須：（一）各會員無論在塲子或電台堂會的表演或播音，每次均須穿揷有益社會及含有敎育意味的唱句一段，（二）全體會員，均須將唱句完全抄成本子，呈送敎育局審査。這現象是很可喜的。</p>
<p>頃者敎育局因鑒於恩派亞戲院及華北歌劇塲白玉霜等正在演唱的蹦蹦戲，唱白動作，皆淫穢不堪，故特派審査員到塲審査，分別予以禁演及改良。並於前日召集全體演員，在市民敎館談話，曉以戲劇所負社會敎育的使命，及指示其應行改善各點：（一）語氣方面，不要有淫穢的雙關語調，（二）聲調方面，不要有靡靡之音，（三）動作不要穢褻，（四）恐慌的劇情禁演，（五）演員不應有誘惑觀衆的舉動，（六）塲面的穿揷，不可過分誇張。這幾點不但蹦蹦戲應改進，卽其他戲劇，亦有改良的必要。</p>
<p>市敎育局近來能實行戲劇的改良，以輔助社會敎育的推行，這是很值得稱讚的。尤以這次對於蹦蹦戲的處置，不取嚴厲禁止的手段，而派員審査，以定改進，頗能顧到演員的生計。然關於我國舊戲劇的改良，我們還有一點意見。誠然戲劇是一種社會敎育。但我國不良的戲劇，何以能產生於社會？而一般民衆，又何以喜觀這類不良的戲劇？這兩個問題，我們希望我國敎育當局，亦能加以深切的注意。</p>

<p>— 新野</p>
<p>「鄉下眞死，到了晚上，除出睡覺之外就一步也走不開了！」確是一個醉心都市生活的靑年，回鄉纔半個月，就使他戚到苦悶了。</p>
<p>「你不好到鎭上茶館里去的？」小姑對她母望了一眼淡淡的說。</p>
<p>「那種污濁而下流的塲合我是不高興去」！他打一個呵欠，似乎有點疲倦的樣子。</p>
<p>「去睡吧！」正在給孩子扎鞋底的三嬸也開口了。</p>
<p>我們一起有七個人，但除了三嬸在做鞋子，小姑母在打絨綫衫，我在看小說外，還有四個人却各據着一面檯角閒坐着，儘把每一條目光投在那慘淡的火燄上，可是那火燄並不解事，只給窗口里吹進來的風扇得一幌一幌的閃耀。一顆一顆的燈花却像綉球花般的結疊起來</p>
<p>村犬發狂似的咆哮着，鷄塒里的老母鷄也給從甜夢中驚醒了，在嘓嘓嘓地叫。雄和瑛已停止了談話，全靜默着，我也將手中正在看的書放了下來，豎着耳朶傾聽…</p>
<p>「咚咚！噹……咚咚！噹！」一個敲着皮皷和小鏜鑼的聲音漸漸地由遠而近終於到了我家門前。在往日，我們在黃昏頭也時常聽到這種聲音，但是大家因為正在叉麻雀，或興高彩烈的從事別種遊戲，所以不會有人去留意它，可是今天它每敲一下都彷彿敲在我們每一個人的心上；那個聲音也分外地來得刺耳。</p>
<p>「唱新聞的，我們叫他進來唱新聞」！雄好像發現了什麼似的，快活得跳了起來。</p>
<h3 id="c205">女神 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 江敉作</p>
<p>一個從戰區裏逃來的農叟，木雞似的坐在不周山脚下，面上顯露出無限的怨憤。他用盡了他的汗血灌渝他田中的禾稻，現在是已經長得一尺多高，可是一塲宣戰，踐踏了他的田禾，毀滅了他的房屋，還使他妻離子散，他想黃河之水幾時淸，世界幾時纔能安寗？（九）</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>唱新聞的是一個四十來歲的瞎子，和一個十二三歲的小姑娘。瞎子右手挾着一把破胡琴，左手却執着一根五六尺長的旱烟管。那小姑娘也一隻手牽着旱烟管的銅斗，一手是拿着一支打皷棒；在她項間却掛着一個小皮皷和一面小鏜鑼，直垂在胸前。想來他們就是父女倆。他在廳上坐了下來，裝起一筒烟來吸着，等待我們的話語，小姑娘却儘把兩隻不十分活靈的眼睛角溜溜的向大家臉上搜尋，像要發現什麼奇蹟似的。</p>
<p>瞎子抽了一回烟，把烟筒頭篤篤地在方磚上敲了兩下，敲去了烟灰，便拿起那支破皮胡來，緊了緊弦綫，正了聲音。</p>
<p>他一邊拉着，一邊唱着，我們却全靜悄悄地，側着腦袋聽。每個人都盯住了瞎子的臉，但在他臉上却不看見有一絲表情；面皮是蠟黃的，鼻子是扁平的，僅有兩片薄薄的嘴唇皮在機械地翕動着，一口焦黃而多缺陷的牙齒，時常從那條裂縫裏露出來。</p>
<p>瞎子唱完了新聞，收起錢，臨走的時候還向我們道了一聲「謝！」遠處已經輕輕地敲過了二更！（完）</p>

<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>（我愛看那半空里在飛翔着的蒼鷹，我更愛聽他那嘹亮的歌聲！靑年的朋友，不要忘記：他所告訴我們的！）</p>
<p>沒有忘記，一點兒也沒有忘記。沒有忘記偉大的蒼鷹的嘹亮的歌聲，也沒有忘記那象鷹一樣地飛翔着的朋友的歌聲。他們的嘹亮而又淸脆的歌聲，象那激奮着每一個人的勇氣的號角聲一樣，不停地，永沒有終止地歌唱着那尖銳而又雄壯的調子，興奮了我，跳躍了每一個靑年人的心。</p>
<p>是一個黃昏。在那遙遠的南方，我們這一羣年靑的孩子有過一個很單簡的聚會。我們在嘆着氣，眉毛打着結地沈默着，全沒有作聲。太陽崛强地從西邊山脚探出個頭來，帶點憐憫，漲紅了臉孔，很憤怒地瞧了一瞧，黑暗露着猙獰的磔笑，張開了一個很大的黑幕，把大地全蓋到灰暗的恐怖的世界里。我們四個，靠着了一塊峭壁，兩個流着淚，一個嘆着氣，一個憤激地粗暴地叫喊。到沒了，先剩下一片荒漠，荒漠閉着嘴吧；靑年人也閉上了嘴吧，垂下了頭，用那有力的手，托着下巴，沒有作聲。（未完）</p>

<p>夏荷生三笑</p>
<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「御碑亭孟月華避雨」</p>
<p>月華是。夕陽影裏走匆匆。誰知曉。驀地空中竟起疾風。一刹那。颯颯蕭蕭吹漸烈。到後來。黃塵匝地捲長空。眼見那。兒童斷了風箏綫。霎時無影又無蹤。耳聽得。道旁樹木沙沙嚮。那風是。入竹穿林勢更兇。吹得那。逆水扁舟忙靠岸。吹得那，順風歸掉掛孤蓬。吹得那。長條柳葉眠還起。吹得那。無力楊花西復東。况且是。烏雲頃刻把天遮蔽。景色依稀與薄暮同，猛聽得。霹歷當頭心膽碎。却原來。雷整不住響隆隆。電光是。萬道金蛇在空際舞。宛如天半掛長虹。分明是。雨師風伯來相會。所以敎。雷公電母做先鋒。這時候。一片平原人迹少。孟月華。難禁小鹿撞心胸。况且是。凉生衣袂春寒嫩。猛抬頭細雨濕濛濛。但只見。行人都避雨回家去。月華是。幾度籌思計已窮。體軟如綿無氣力。敎人兒怎不怨蒼穹。然而是。巧合天綠從古說。那月華避雨向亭中。偏與書生陌路逢。</p>

<p>攝影塲裏趣事</p>
<p>「春之花中有幾個攝影裏素描的鏡頭，戲中高占非被一家影片公司儷作臨時演員，在某影片中代替一個男主角拍跳水的鏡頭，因為他的面孔，恰像某男主角，同時也是因為生活的問題，而只好作一次他人不肯曾試的跳水的危險了。</p>
<p>在這裏，「春之花」導演吳村，利用這幾個鏡頭，對時下高貴的不良的電影從業員，作了一下諷刺。當戲中女主角朱秋痕從化裝室裏出來，口中唱着外國電影歌曲，走到高占非身邊，與之打招呼，並給以糖果，這時被僱作臨時演員的老高，見女主角對他這樣親切的舉動，非常驚異，朱秋痕這時忽覺得身上的衣扣沒有扣好，撤嬌似的呌高占非替他扣好。</p>
<p>突然。某眞的男主角，從劇務部裏跑出來了，走近朱的面前，高呼道，「喂！朱小姐，您幹嗎呀？』</p>
<p>朱秋痕見了男主角，大為驚異：「啊！您不是這裏嗎，你是誰？」</p>
<p>男主角：「他是臨時演員，要代替我跳水的。』</p>

All parties are working extremely hard, and the future seems to be gradually brightening, with hopes that the difficult situation can be overcome. According to foreign news reports, Japanese Minister of the Army Kawashima recently summoned Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau Imai, Colonel Kita, Lieutenant Colonel Kusumoto, Lieutenant Colonel Muto, and others at his residence for important discussions and dispatched Colonel Kita to China to liaise with the Japanese garrison in Tianjin.

It is said that the head of a certain foreign intelligence agency in Beiping is scheduled to come to Tianjin early on the 7th to meet with Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, relevant parties announced that Song Zheyuan had gone to Tianjin, but it was later learned that Song had not gone to Tianjin and was still in the Western Hills. (6th dispatch, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Four Beiping city councilors, Lü Junzhou, Zhao Zhaoxiang, Xie Zhenhe, and Cui Lintai, went to the Jurentang together on the morning of the 6th to meet with He Yingqin, presenting the situation in North China and requesting an early resolution to stabilize the region and protect sovereignty. (6th dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After He Yingqin went to Beiping to study the Hebei situation with Song Zheyuan, the haze in North China is gradually clearing. Song went to the suburbs on the 5th for a rest due to feeling slightly unwell. Some foreign newspapers have misrepresented this information, which is absolutely inaccurate. He sent a telegram to Ye Chucang on the 5th, reporting the true situation. (6th dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Secretary-General Ye Chucang received a telegram from He Yingqin on the 5th, stating, "After I arrived in Beiping, I am conducting a detailed study of the Hebei situation with Commander Song Mingxuan.

<p>(Tokyo) Colonel Kita, by order of the Ministry of the Army, left Tokyo for North China at 9:00 p.m. tonight. Accompanying him was Lieutenant Colonel Muto, a member of the Military Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Army. (6th dispatch, Japan United News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the progress of the North China autonomy issue, the final attitude and policy of the military department were studied in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Department. A decision was made yesterday, so Colonel Kita of the General Staff Headquarters was specially dispatched to North China on the 6th with this policy, to submit the policy to the Japanese authorities in North China and to be responsible for liaison between the central government and the authorities stationed in China. The policy specifically stipulates in detail the military department's policy for handling the North China issue in the future. Furthermore, Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in also briefed the Emperor on the gist of this policy this morning. (6th dispatch, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from He Yingqin's side, He Yingqin, Xiong Shihui, and Chen Yi, after Song Zheyuan left Beiping, summoned Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying to Jurentang to exchange views. Subsequently, figures from the central government further discussed countermeasures last night. (6th dispatch, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, Japanese Minister of the Army Kawashima consulted with the government authorities on dealing with the North China situation. As a result, it was decided to send Kita to Tianjin to meet with the commander of the Tianjin garrison and personnel from the Kwantung Army to convey the latest decision of the Japanese government. The content of the new mission is still difficult to fully ascertain. Kita is scheduled to depart from Japan on the 7th and arrive on the 9th. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the urgency of the situation in North China, Minister of the Army Kawashima summoned Colonel Kita of the General Staff Headquarters and Lieutenant Colonel Kusumoto, the chief of the Manchuria-Mongolia Section, to his residence yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter with Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Imai and Lieutenant Colonel Muto. As a result, it was decided to dispatch Colonel Kita to North China within a few days to liaise with the China Garrison Army. (6th dispatch, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Song and Itagaki met on Wednesday night, and the result was not satisfactory. Itagaki reportedly stated that the Japanese military authorities would not accept any solution other than complete autonomy for North China. The veracity of this statement cannot be confirmed, but since He Yingqin came north, the Japanese military authorities have been quite dissatisfied with the change in the situation. This is certainly evident. The optimism that the Japanese side would not oppose He's approach seems unfounded. In short, the situation is confusing, and even those who are extremely concerned about Sino-Japanese politics find it difficult to understand the true nature of the changes in the current situation. Last night, 24 people in 10 cars went to He Yingqin's residence to present so-called petitions from various autonomous groups. The guards closed the doors and refused to accept them. The demonstrators did not cause any disturbance and said they would present the petitions to Xiao Zhenying before driving away. (6th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft have been flying over for days to show force, and the citizens of Beiping are panicking again, similar to the time of the Jehol dispute two years ago. This morning at 11:30, nine Japanese reconnaissance planes flew over the Legation Quarter and He Yingqin's residence in Beijing. Half an hour later, three twin-engine large bombers flew in formation over various locations. The Japanese side has not formally explained the aircraft display, but a Japanese military spokesman said that the reasons for the Japanese aircraft coming are twofold: (1) for training; (2) this matter may be related to reports received by the Japanese side from the demilitarized zone. According to reports received by the Japanese side, Shang Zhen's army is now moving to Ninghe and Lutai, fearing that it will undermine the security of the demilitarized zone. The purpose of the Japanese aircraft is to investigate whether this rumor is true. The Japanese authorities have now inquired with the Chinese side about the troop movement of the Chinese army. The spokesman also said that the Japanese aircraft came from Shanhaiguan. When asked what treaty the Japanese aircraft were based on to have the right to fly over Chinese territory, he replied that during the negotiations between He Yingqin and former Japanese Army Commander Umezu in June, He agreed that Japanese aircraft could fly over any location in Hebei Province. Where is Song Zheyuan? It is still unclear. A certain Chinese dignitary said today that Song is in Tangshan, but Japanese sources say that Song is in Tianjin. Song's confidant, Xiao Zhenying, and one of Song's Japanese secretaries went to Tianjin this morning, probably to meet with Song. The newly appointed Mayor of Xiamen, Yu Jinhe, arrived in Beiping this morning with He Qigong. He came here to represent Han Fuju in discussions with He Yingqin. Yu Jinhe is a friend of Japanese Army Commander Tada, and He Yingqin has retained him in Beiping to assist in everything. Yu Puhe, Chen Yi, Yin Tong, and Xiong Shihui, who are currently assisting in the negotiations, are all graduates of Japanese military officer schools. After He Qigong arrived in Beiping, he immediately paid a visit to He Yingqin to report Han's views on the situation. Chinese officials have firmly denied the claim that Shang Zhen's troops have entered the demilitarized zone. (6th dispatch, Reuters)</p>

The Political Committee has a Secretariat with one secretary-general and one deputy secretary-general. 6. Under the Political Committee are the Legal, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Education, Land, and Transportation specialized committees, each with 9 to 15 members, filled by central committee members and party members who have specialized research in the matters in charge of each committee. Experts may also be hired as consultants. Each specialized committee has one chairman and one vice chairman. The vice chairman may not hold other positions. Note: (1) After the establishment of the various planning committees and specialized committees under the Central Executive Committee and the Political Committee, government agencies with similar organizations should be abolished to concentrate talents and unify authority. (2) The organizational regulations of the various departments, offices, and committees of the Central Executive Committee should be revised or drafted separately and assigned to a number of people by the Standing Committee for handling. (6th dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to what the reporter has learned, the organizational outline of the Central Executive Committee passed this time has several important changes compared to the previous organization of the Central Committee: (1) The number of members of the Standing Committee remains the same, but the election of a chairman and vice chairman is an innovation of the Party. Also, when the Standing Committee meets, in the past, all members of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee and alternate members of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee were able to attend, but in the future, only the personnel specified in the organizational outline will be able to attend. (2) The departments in charge of the Central Organization, Propaganda, and People's Training, the agency of division of labor, before the Fourth National Congress, there was one minister and two deputy ministers, but at the first plenary session of the fourth session, it was changed to a committee, with one chairman, one vice chairman, and a number of committee members. Now it has been restored to a department, but only one deputy minister is established, and a number of committee members may be established when necessary to undertake design work. (3) In addition to the Finance, Fuxu, and Party History committees, which are established as usual under the Executive Committee, and the change of the Standing Committee system to the chairman system, four planning committees for Overseas Party Affairs, Local Autonomy, National Economy, and Cultural Undertakings are newly established. (4) The highest guiding body for Central Politics, the eleventh session was the Political Committee and a presidium was established. The first plenary session of the third session was changed to a political conference, and the Standing Committee system was implemented. Now it is changed back to the Political Committee, with one chairman and one vice chairman each. Also, in the past, when the Political Conference was held, all members of the Central Committee could attend, but in the future, only the personnel specified in the organizational outline will be able to attend politics. (5) One additional deputy secretary-general is added to the Political Committee. (6) The various specialized committees attached to the Political Committee were previously called groups, and each was to select a convener, but it was later changed to the chairman system, and it was stipulated that the vice chairman may not hold other positions, to focus on responsibility. (6th dispatch, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the opening of public opinion, the protection of journalists, and the improvement of news censorship methods, all previous central conferences have had resolutions, but the implementation in various places is still not perfect. Recently, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao was once again banned from postal delivery due to writing articles encouraging the North China authorities. Zhou Fo-hai, Zeng Yangfu, Luo Jialun, Pan Gongzhan, and other 56 Central Committee members specially proposed at the first plenary session of the first session on the 5th: (1) To send a letter to the National Government ordering the whole country to effectively protect legitimate public opinion; (2) To order the Executive Yuan to telegraph the post office to release the Ta Kung Pao; (3) The news censorship methods will be earnestly improved by the Standing Committee. The release of the Ta Kung Pao was resolved and passed by the third session. The Ministry of Transportation has urgently telegraphed the Tianjin post office to send it as usual.

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Consul General Suma in Beijing returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th. At 10:00 a.m., he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Tang Yuren. In addition to stating that the article in the Shanghai Japanese newspaper Shanghai Nippo, which stated that Tang had visited Arita and presented five concrete proposals for North China, was inaccurate, he also inquired about the situation in North China. The conversation lasted about an hour before he left. At 3:00 p.m., Suma visited Tang again at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue the conversation for about half an hour before leaving. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese military attache Amemiya visited Tang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs twice on the 6th, in the morning and afternoon, for discussions. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 5th, the Shanghai Japanese newspaper Shanghai Nippo published a report that Vice Minister Tang Yuren visited Ambassador Arita and presented five concrete proposals for North China. According to Tang, he visited Ambassador Arita on the afternoon of the 4th to explain the process and purpose of Minister He's trip to the north and to inquire about the Japanese side's observations. Other than that, there was not a word about concrete proposals. The report published by the newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the morning of the 6th, Tang asked Japanese Consul General Suma to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about this matter. Suma stated that he could responsibly say that no one in the Japanese embassy had made such a statement to reporters, which proves that this news is completely unfounded. (6th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">New Developments in North China: The United States Cannot Stand Idly By; Existing Treaties Should Be Strictly Respected; The Hull Declaration is Clearly Directed at Japan; The British Foreign Secretary's Words Express Concern <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull issued a formal statement today, declaring to the world that the United States cannot turn a blind eye to the autonomy movement in North China and requesting that all nations respect existing treaties. Although Japan was not mentioned in the statement, it is clearly aimed at Japan. Hull stated that regardless of the origin or instigator, it is a fact that someone is attempting to make significant changes to the political status and situation of several northern provinces of China, and that this is being resisted by China. Any unusual development in any part of China is naturally of concern not only to the people of China and the United States, but also to the people of all countries with interests in China, as their relationship with China and their rights and obligations under treaties are similar. The interests of the United States in North China are the same as those of other countries. Therefore, the US government is closely monitoring the developments in North China. In this period of global political unrest and economic instability, governments and peoples of all countries must adhere to principles and promises, he said. In response to questions from reporters, the State Department clarified that the aforementioned statement was directed at Japan. At the same time, rumors of Anglo-American cooperation regarding North China have not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, when interviewed by a Reuters correspondent today, welcomed Secretary of State Hull's declaration regarding North China, saying that it proves that the United States has abandoned its nearly isolationist stance. Ambassador Guo also mentioned the statement by the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo that the Nine-Power Treaty does not apply to the North China dispute, saying that this proves the difficulties China faces in dealing with Japan. Sir Austen Chamberlain, in a previous speech in the House of Commons, urged China to adopt a realistic view and compromise with Japan regarding Manchuria. He is more realistic in his views of China than anyone else. China has been slow to compromise with Japan because it firmly believes that no compromise can be reached or that Japan's demands will ever cease. (Reuters dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>Hull Declaration Full Text</p>
<p>(Nanjing) U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement to the American press on the 5th regarding the North China incident. We have obtained the full text from relevant sources and translated it as follows: Political disputes of an extraordinary nature and with far-reaching implications are currently occurring in northern China. According to reports, these changes involve many people, are happening very quickly, cover a wide range, and opinions are very divided. No one can predict what the future holds. But regardless of the origin, instigator, or method, it is a fact that someone is working to make significant changes to the political status and situation of several northern provinces of China, and that this is being resisted. Any unusual change in any part of China is naturally and necessarily of concern not only to the government and people of China, but also to all countries enjoying interests in China, as their relationship with China and their treaty rights and obligations within China are largely the same. The United States is one such country. In the region in question, the interests of the United States are the same as those of other countries. In this region, the United States has a large number of expatriates, some property, and important commercial and cultural enterprises. Therefore, the United States government is paying close attention to the changes in the situation. Political unrest and pressure can cause anxiety and fear, and can also lead to economic and social unrest, making it difficult to enjoy treaty rights and fulfill treaty obligations. The views of the United States government on such events, whether they relate to China or the world, are well known to the world. In this time of global political unrest and economic instability, in the view of our country (referring to the United States) government, it is most important for the governments and peoples of all countries to keep faith and promises. I have repeatedly said that in international relations, there must be faith and promises must be kept so that we can have a sense of credibility, stability, and security, as these are necessary for orderly life and progress. Our government has unwavering faith in the fundamental principles of its long-standing policies, and our government adheres firmly to the provisions of the treaties it has acceded to, and continues to expect that all countries will respect the terms of the treaties they have solemnly signed, as these terms facilitate and adjust the relationship between the signatory countries in order to obtain mutual and common benefits.

<p>British Parliament Foreign Affairs Debate</p>
<p>(London) During the debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons last night, Foreign Secretary Hoare spoke, expressing concern about the serious situation in North China, saying that the Chinese sky is covered in dense haze, referring to the so-called North China autonomy movement. News of Japanese personnel activities is frequently reported. Recent Japanese military actions are probably related to the Japanese personnel movement. This news has caused great concern to the British government, so it has specifically instructed its chargé d'affaires in Tokyo to notify the government with great attention, and declared that we welcome Japan to make a frank announcement of its policies. The Japanese government told the British chargé d'affaires that the autonomy movement is purely a Chinese movement. The Japanese government is closely watching this matter because it has extensive interests in North China. Some say that Japan is implementing military intervention, but this is unfounded. Japanese troops have not been transferred into China as a result of the autonomy movement. The troops stationed in Tianjin and Beijing are lower than the original number. The movement of troops near Beijing is the movement of troops originally stationed south of the Great Wall. Japan has the inherent right to maintain troops there. The reported movement of trains is for this reason. The Foreign Secretary continued that the overall situation is very chaotic, but he believes that the talks currently underway between the Chinese and Japanese governments will certainly enable any current difficulties to be resolved peacefully. He considers the recurrence of such incidents to be unfortunate, as regardless of their true nature, they are sufficient to make people believe that Japan is currently using its influence to shape the development and administrative arrangements of China's internal affairs. Any event that gives rise to this belief can only damage Japan's reputation and hinder the development of mutually friendly relations between Japan and China and its other neighbors that all parties desire. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the mission of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, to the Far East, saying that China's finances are becoming increasingly difficult and its currency system is becoming increasingly chaotic, which is harmful to China and the business community. It seems necessary to find a remedy. The British government's intention is that the Chinese government cannot satisfactorily resolve all of its difficulties unless it obtains the friendly cooperation of the countries concerned, together with China itself. Based on this view, we decided to send Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to the Far East to conduct an investigation, while other governments did not accept our suggestion to take similar action. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross went to Shanghai to consult with the Chinese authorities and began his investigation after staying in Tokyo for several weeks. While discussions were underway, the Chinese government was forced to take swift action due to a sudden exchange rate crisis in the country, and announced a change in the legal basis of the silver currency on November 4. The Foreign Secretary then solemnly declared that the Chinese government's action was entirely voluntary and did not seek the opinion of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross. All reports received by the British government to date indicate that the currency reform plan has been welcomed in all quarters and has had a good effect in restoring confidence.

<p>(London) Conservative MP Stratton asked Foreign Secretary Hoare in the House of Commons, "Given that Japan is continuing to occupy China with armed forces, what steps will the British government take to protect British commercial interests in China?" Foreign Secretary Hoare immediately replied in writing, stating, "The governments of China and Japan are fully aware of the attitude taken by the British government to protect British interests in China. As for the current situation in China, especially the situation in North China, the British Ambassador to China will closely monitor it. But so far, the British government has no need to take any special steps regarding the situation Mr. Stratton is concerned about." (Havas dispatch of the 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Current Sino-Japanese Problem <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Ran</p>
<p>In a world where nations stand side by side, every nation cherishes its own country. If a country is subjected to aggression by a strong power, the patriotic sentiments of its people will inevitably be very high, leading to patriotic actions to resist foreign aggression. At this time, even if the ruler of the country wants to temporarily tolerate foreign aggression, he must show his determination to uphold the national stand in order to gain the understanding and sympathy of the people. This simple common sense can also be used to explain the current Sino-Japanese problem.</p>
<p>China and Japan stand side by side in East Asia. They are truly said to be of the same script and race, with a relationship of interdependence. Unfortunately, the modern civilizations of the two countries have not developed equally, and there is a difference between advanced and backward. More unfortunately, due to the limitations of the world situation, the advanced country, due to its development needs, not only cannot support the backward country, but also wants to use the backward country as its sacrifice. On the other hand, the backward China, under the situation of being cut up, has no choice but to struggle for survival. This is why the Sino-Japanese relationship has deteriorated since the Republic of China. Recently, the global economic panic has intensified the colonial competition among the great powers. Japan, in order to expand its colonial territories, actually wants to open up a path of Sino-Japanese friendship under the threat of force. This kind of friendship is no different from the friendship between a wolf and a lamb. How can our nation accept it?</p>
<p>Our nation today still has only struggle left. The purpose of struggle is only to seek survival. Whoever does not allow us to survive, we should recognize as an enemy. The Japanese often express anger at our country's approach to Europe and the United States. In fact, since they have placed our nation in a state of struggle, we have no choice but to seek help in our urgency. Japan, if it wants to seek genuine friendship with us, this friendship must be built on the basis of "mutual coexistence." For this, Japan must first abandon its past aggressive attitude, and especially respect the most ordinary and basic public opinion of our nation, namely</p>
<p>"Cherish our own country."</p>
<p>Public opinion is irresistible. This is not only something that people in neighboring countries should understand, but also something that our country's authorities should understand. "Those who follow it will prosper, and those who oppose it will perish" is indeed shown by history. Why did the Northern Warlords fall? Why did the National Revolution progress? Why are politicians and military men who are willing to betray the country always despised by the people? The reason is very obvious. The more serious the national crisis, the greater the power of public opinion. Those in power, if they want to overcome the current difficulties, have no choice but to comply with public opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e12">British and French Experts' Proposals Fail to Satisfy Italy's Desires; British and French Foreign Ministers to Meet in Paris Today; Awaiting Agreement Before Submitting to the League of Nations <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Diplomats here today generally believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is preparing to reject the Anglo-French proposals for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. It is believed that the agreement is unsatisfactory because it fails to meet Italy's minimum territorial expansion demands. But Mussolini is prepared to compromise, so he will not flatly reject the plan, but will hint that he is willing to accept a more generous proposal. (Guomin News Agency dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(London) According to official sources, the solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute currently being discussed by the British and French governments, after the two countries have fully agreed, will probably be submitted to the League of Nations first, or temporarily kept by the foreign ministries of the United Kingdom and France. It is not intended to be submitted to Italy immediately before Italy's attitude changes, as there seems to be little hope for Italy to change its attitude in the short term. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to "Le Temps," British Foreign Office expert on Abyssinia, Henderson, and French Foreign Office Director for African Affairs, Saint-Quentin, recently reached a consensus in their discussions here, which could serve as the basis for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. This proposal was personally delivered to the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerutti, by Prime Minister Laval yesterday. The newspaper also said that Britain is expected to propose a ceasefire based on the above plan to both sides on the 12th of this month. (Havas dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that Prime Minister Laval explained to the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerutti, last night that Britain and France are responsible for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, so they hope that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will explain his minimum requirements for Abyssinia. It is also the general impression that Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare are now eager for Italy to respond before the meeting of the Committee of Eighteen on December 12. As for the plan drafted by the British and French experts, in general, it involves the exchange of land between Italy and Ethiopia without harming the sovereignty of either party. However, according to informed sources, the two experts have not been able to fully agree on some points. (Havas dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Semi-official circles here still doubt whether the future negotiations with Italy will be successful, because it is reported that the result of the Italian Ambassador Grandi's visit to the Foreign Office yesterday did not reveal any new factors to fulfill the expectations of the general public. It is generally believed that even if Italy accepts the Anglo-French proposal as the basis for starting negotiations, a compromise may not be reached before January next year, because by January, the two rainy seasons of Ethiopia will be approaching, and economic sanctions will definitely begin to have a serious impact at that time. When Italian public opinion feels this difficulty, it may be easier to accept a peaceful resolution of the dispute. (Havas dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Key Points of British and French Experts' Proposals</p>
<p>(Paris) According to "Le Temps," the key points of the British and French experts' proposals are as follows: (1) Italy would demarcate a corridor in Eritrea, along with the port of Assab, and cede it to Ethiopia to build a railway from the port to the Ethiopian capital. (2) The existing borders of Ethiopia would be modified, with part of the northern Tigray province ceded to Italy, but the holy city of Aksum would remain Ethiopian. (3) The entire southern Ogaden province and its western areas up to 40 degrees east longitude would be ceded to Italy, as well as the eastern Danakil region and the Wasa region and part of the Harar province, so that Italy could connect its Eritrean and Somaliland territories. (4) The above agreement should take the form of an Italo-Ethiopian treaty. (5) The sovereignty of the remaining parts of Ethiopia would remain with the Ethiopian Emperor, and the Emperor could request assistance from the League of Nations, but it would not be necessary to request assistance from the League of Nations as previously suggested. (Havas dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Rome's Attitude is Very Cold</p>
<p>(Rome) Since the news that British and French experts were in Paris to hold talks and had reached an agreement that could serve as the basis for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the general sentiment here had indeed gradually eased, but it was very temporary, and after only three days it returned to coldness. Although British Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered a foreign policy speech in the British House of Commons last night, explaining Britain's attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, according to what this agency's diplomatic correspondent knows, the cold emotions here have not changed due to Hoare's remarks. Diplomatic circles believe that a concrete plan for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian problem has not yet been formed, which contradicts what was expected a few days ago, so the future of the problem looks even worse. Responsible parties also said that although the various guarantees provided by Hoare to Italy are welcome, their content has long been known to the country. This shows that the British attitude has not changed from beginning to end. It is generally believed that Hoare's speech almost indicated that the necessary condition for starting any negotiations is to first stop the war, which the Italian government believes there is no room to accept.

<p>Hoare Departs for France This Morning</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will be accompanied by Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart when he goes to Paris. Vansittart will stay in the French capital for several days to discuss with the French authorities the possibility of negotiating with Germany on the limitation of land and air armaments. Foreign Secretary Hoare is now scheduled to depart for France on Saturday morning and, after talking with Prime Minister Laval in Paris, will go to Switzerland for a few days of rest that evening.

<h3 id="e13">Italian Air Force Bombs Taxis City: Three Attacks Result in Heavy Casualties; King Remains Calm Despite Scare; Decisive Battle Imminent <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) According to an urgent dispatch from the capital of Albania, nine Italian aircraft attacked Taxis City today, where the Albanian King resides. The King and his accompanying young son were unharmed. Bombs hit the palace of Crown Prince Hassan, causing a portion of it to be destroyed by fire. The Crown Prince is currently stationed in the capital as regent for military and political affairs. American Hospital was also hit by bombs, destroying several hospital tents. Italian aircraft carried out a total of three attacks. It is reported that a total of thirty-two people were killed and two hundred injured, with varying degrees of severity. Among the injured was an officer from the Inspection Office who sustained minor injuries. After the attacks, the King and his young son immediately went to the American Hospital to visit the wounded. The three attacks caused significant material losses. The Albanian government is planning to lodge a serious protest with the League of Nations due to the Italian aircraft bombing an undefended town and a hospital displaying the Red Cross flag. Today, Italian aircraft were active elsewhere, bombing Albanian troops engaged in combat, resulting in numerous casualties. Gonda Town was also bombed last night. It is reported that the Albanian King, although startled today, remained calm and will soon go to the front lines to consult with various commanders regarding future Albanian military strategy. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Taxis City: A special correspondent of this newspaper, Lavoya, reports: Ten Italian aircraft flew over this area at 8:30 this morning, carrying out indiscriminate bombing. (It is noted that the Albanian King is currently stationed in Taxis City, directing military operations at the front.) Subsequently, twenty more Italian aircraft flew over the city. It is rumored that one Italian plane was shot down by Albanian forces. The targets of the Italian bombing were the Crown Prince's palace and the American Hospital in the city. A portion of the Crown Prince's palace has been destroyed. It is reported that ten people were killed and eighty seriously injured. The Albanian government has lodged a protest against the Italian aircraft bombing the undefended Taxis City and the hospital displaying the Red Cross flag. The Albanian King personally visited the American Hospital to visit the wounded. It is reported that Italian aircraft also flew to Gonda Town yesterday afternoon and dropped bombs. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Albanian Capital: This newspaper's special correspondent, O'Chana, reports: Since the Italian Air Force bombed Taxis City this morning, military personnel here believe that a major war between the Italian and Albanian armies will begin soon. It is especially believed that the Italian aircraft simultaneously bombed Qiqi Jia City on the Southern Wojiaden front, making the possibility of a decisive battle even more credible. It is generally believed that the Italian aircraft's target was to bomb the Albanian Emperor, because if the Albanian Emperor were to be lost, internal difficulties would inevitably arise in Albania. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a dispatch from Taxis to the Chronicle, the Albanian Emperor has ordered preparations for an attack on Italian forces in the north, vowing to drive them out of the country. This order was issued to all Albanian troops currently attacking Magar. Before issuing the order at midnight, the Albanian Emperor convened a military meeting and had long telephone conversations with front-line generals. The Albanian Emperor has erected a red tent in Taxis today, which is a signal of offensive operations. Government inspectors are unwilling to disclose the date and location of the battle but said that the Albanian Emperor will personally go to the front lines to command 600,000 troops. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Asmara: Today's public report states that an Albanian team attacked the Italian army's supply train behind the lines, northwest of Jiagaer, killing only one Italian soldier and wounding two. Italian aircraft bombed a column of Albanian soldiers with bombs and machine guns in Huqila, twenty miles north of Gonda, causing many Albanian casualties, and they dispersed immediately. Yesterday and today, a large squadron of Italian bombers, accompanied by many reconnaissance aircraft, bombed the entire line of Albanian troops engaged in combat, achieving significant results. The Italian army claims that a team of General Seyum's troops attacked a detachment of soldiers 20 miles inside the Italian front line at night. Residents of the villages of Tabaga and Atbis assisted the soldiers in dispersing them, with only one Italian soldier injured. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian Chamber of Deputies (i.e., the Corporate Council) is scheduled to meet on Saturday this week. The only item on the agenda is "The Twentieth Day of Economic Encirclement" (Note: The League of Nations' sanctions against Italy began on November 18 and will reach twenty days on the 7th of this month). It is expected that Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver a speech at the meeting of the Chamber, outlining the military situation at the front and various plans to resist sanctions. Speaker Chiano (i.e., the father of the Prime Minister's son-in-law, Propaganda Minister Count Chiano) will report that forty-two members of the Chamber of Deputies have volunteered to go to East Africa to join the army and are therefore unable to attend. Finally, all members of the Chamber of Deputies will donate their gold medals to meet the needs of the national treasury. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) In recent days, Italy has continued to collect gold throughout the country to replenish the reserves of the Bank of Italy. As for the embargo on oil, the general impression is that Britain will inevitably encounter real difficulties because other countries besides Britain may not be able to implement the embargo. Everyone believes in the government's propaganda, believing that even if there is an embargo on oil, Italy will be able to resist it. In addition, today's newspapers published news for the first time that Britain and France are now working hard to find a basis for peace talks that Italy can accept. The Forum newspaper requested, "Although there is no definitive evidence that British Foreign Secretary Sir El will come to Rome, this rumor proves that informal talks between Rome, Paris, and London must have made great progress." As for the British Mediterranean's largest warship, the Hood, and the Upper Noun, being transferred to the Atlantic Ocean, newspapers here also praised them. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Paris Morning Post's Rome correspondent stated that Italy has established negotiations with the US New Jersey Standard Oil Company, agreeing that if Geneva passes an oil ban, the company will supply Italy with the oil it needs. If the Mediterranean is blocked, the oil needed by the Italian expeditionary force can be transported through the Far East to provide supplies. In return, the Italian government has granted the company a 30-year exclusive right to supply oil to the Italian government. Italy is also discussing a credit loan of 100 million gold lire with the company to develop oil fields in Albania. According to Italian government officials, Italy can obtain 300,000 tons of oil annually from this oil field. However, the Italian government has denied the above news. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

After Italy amended its tariff rules in 1933, the company weighed the pros and cons and then had a plan to build a factory, which was not initiated due to the oil embargo issue. According to the American Daily Commercial News, the company bought an oil refinery in the port of Naples in July of this year. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Ruhr delivered a long speech in the House of Commons last night, explaining the various aspects of British diplomatic policy, such as the disarmament issue, the redistribution of raw materials, the Far East issue, the Italian-Albanian dispute, and the Egyptian issue. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Attitude Towards the Italian-Albanian Case</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary mentioned the Abyssinian issue, saying that Britain has fulfilled its full mission in collective action under the Covenant and continues to work to find a peaceful solution to the Italian-Albanian dispute. The member states of the League of Nations are almost entirely united, regardless of sacrifice, in participating in collective economic sanctions, and the member states are also unanimously in favor of the British and French efforts to seek peace. Britain and France have made it clear that (1) the scope of work is limited to the League of Nations, (2) they are willing to share special responsibilities with other member states as soon as possible, and (3) the conditions discussed must be acceptable to the League of Nations, Italy, and Albania. The League of Nations is currently carrying out economic sanctions, and the work is progressing smoothly. The situation is constantly under the supervision of the Committee of Experts. If gaps are found in the implementation, they will do everything possible to consolidate this common front.</p>
<p>Oil Embargo Issue</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also mentioned the oil embargo issue, saying that what I can say is that we have done our duty in the scope of the organization of collective action, and we are fully prepared to carry out our responsibilities in this oil embargo issue. The League of Nations has agreed in principle to the oil embargo. No country is more responsible for this collective decision than any other country. This is what I should declare. When the League of Nations collectively decides to implement the oil embargo, we are prepared to fulfill the collective action it has agreed upon. Recently, some people have pointed out that British oil companies are taking the opportunity to profit. I would like to explain this accusation. In the past quarter, the amount of oil imported into Italy has indeed increased significantly compared with the past, but the increase did not come from companies related to Britain. Taking the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as an example, the amount of oil it shipped to Italy in the first eleven months of this year was less than in the same period last year, and the decrease was particularly significant in the three months from August to October.</p>
<p>Acting in the Spirit of the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary continued to mention the postponement of the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Committee, saying that the change in the meeting date should not be regarded as the weakness of the member states' attitude, but only to give the opportunity to actively strive for a peaceful solution. It may be impossible to reconcile the differences between the League of Nations, Italy, and Albania, but Britain and France want to double their efforts in the short period before the League of Nations meeting. The world now urgently needs peace. Britain and France are acting for the League of Nations in the spirit of the League of Nations and are determined to make another major effort to seek peace. We do not want to humiliate Italy or weaken it. We very much hope to see Italy be a strong country in the world morally, politically, and socially, and be able to make great contributions to the world.</p>
<p>Appeal to Italy for Peace</p>
<p>I now appeal again to Mussolini and his countrymen to completely dispel any suspicion that Britain is harboring malice towards the League of Nations' assistance. We absolutely do not want to interfere in Italy's internal affairs. We sincerely hope to see Italy be strong and prosperous under the rule of a strong government in accordance with the political system desired by its people. When collective action is needed one day, the League of Nations, including Britain, is responsible for acting in accordance with the Covenant. The League of Nations will never be weak, and the member states will never fail to fulfill their obligations. The countries now need a long period of rest. If economic recovery is guaranteed, then permanent peace can be laid. The peace of Britain and its empire and the peace of the whole world are the basis of our policy. We will not hesitate to make our voice against war heard by everyone, and make our force against war felt by everyone. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>French-Italian Relations with Egypt</p>
<p>Hall's speech also paid attention to recent events in Egypt, saying that the government does not express indifference to the emotions of the Egyptian people, and hopes to establish British-Egyptian relations on a satisfactory basis forever. The government is currently paying close attention to this. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Sky Covenant Issue</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary denied the rumor that the British government's diplomatic policy had changed after former Foreign Secretary Simon left office. He also said that the British government had tried to discuss the issue of reducing armaments with German leader Hitler again, but Germany currently holds the view that as long as the war in Albania is not over, continued discussions cannot achieve anything. The Sky Covenant and the reduction of sky armaments are all important plans today. The government will not neglect the opportunity to discuss again to obtain a satisfactory result.</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>World Raw Material Distribution</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary next mentioned the issue of raw materials in the colonies, reiterating his speech in Geneva, acknowledging the concerns of certain countries without raw materials, saying that he believed this issue was economic rather than political. The Foreign Secretary concluded that the government is prepared to conduct investigations in a tranquil atmosphere, but discussing this matter in the atmosphere of war cannot lead to any hope of a solution.</p>
<p>Eden Ends Debate</p>
<p>League of Nations Affairs Officer Eden concluded the debate on foreign affairs, saying that there are now fifty countries willing to bear the responsibility of unwelcome sanctions, which is excellent evidence that they are eager to see the birth of a new era. He believed that the increasing consolidation of the collective security system makes it possible to reduce the level of armaments. If the League of Nations' position is further stabilized by this dispute, it will create an opportunity to seek compromises on armament reduction and restrictions. We must not miss this opportunity. Then it was officially announced that the debate was postponed. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin is Deeply Concerned</p>
<p>(Berlin) The political figures here are very concerned about the British Foreign Secretary Hall's diplomatic speech in the House of Commons last night. Among them, the one that concerns the Germans the most is the disarmament issue, especially the Sky Covenant issue. In well-informed circles, it is said that Leader Hitler has repeatedly stated in the past that Germany's army will not be allowed to modify its strength figures under any circumstances. However, he also said, "Regarding air force strength, if appropriate restrictions are added, I am also prepared to consider it, but the extent of the restrictions must be based on maintaining equality with the major Western European countries."

<h3 id="e20">Naval Conference Nears: Britain and the United States Will Jointly Put Pressure on Japan; Conflicting Negotiations Among Naval Powers Face Many Difficulties <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(London) The London Naval Conference will officially open soon. Delegations from various participating countries have arrived one after another. The League of Nations has also sent observers to attend. The importance of this conference is evident. Since Japan announced the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty last December, the treaty's validity will expire at the end of next year, and the balance of power among the major naval powers created by the Washington Treaty will also collapse. Therefore, creating a new balance of power system among the major naval powers to replace the Washington system is the main goal of this naval conference. The mission of this naval conference is nothing more than two ends, namely the qualitative restriction and quantitative restriction of the navy. The difficulty in resolving these two problems lies in the mutual opposition of the naval powers. In the Pacific, there is the opposition of Britain, the United States, and Japan. In Europe, there is the opposition of France and Italy. This is in terms of all the difficulties in the past. Now, a new difficulty has been added, namely the German naval issue. Since Britain and Germany established a naval agreement on June 18 this year, the German naval power and the British naval power are linked to each other. In other words, if the British navy increases its tonnage, Germany will also increase accordingly. For this reason, the French navy must maintain constant contact with the British navy in order to deal with Germany. From now on, the French naval policy will depend on the British naval policy. If Britain expands its navy due to concerns about the Pacific, France will have to expand accordingly. In addition, on the surface, what is discussed at this naval conference is only limited to technical issues, but in practice, the advancement of naval negotiations will inevitably depend on political considerations. If the Washington Naval Treaty is to be re-discussed, then the military strategy clauses contained therein must also be studied. The provision in Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty prohibiting the increase of fortifications on Pacific islands is based on the naval balance of power in the Pacific at that time. Now that the naval balance of power has changed, this article needs to be revised. If the London Naval Conference fails to create a new balance of power system among the naval powers, then this article will have no possibility of continuing. Although the delegations from various countries attending the London Naval Conference have stated that they are prepared to discuss this issue, their attitudes are significantly different. Generally speaking, the Anglo-Saxon countries will jointly put pressure on Japan, while Japan hopes to maintain the current system of Pacific military strategy. This is almost inevitable. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Naval experts today believe that the United States will demand at the London Conference that any naval agreement must maintain the existing 5.5.3 ratio. If this conference fails to establish an agreement to limit naval armaments, the US naval authorities will seek funds to add warships, and regardless of how much other countries build, they must maintain this ratio. Before the current US fleet, in fact, it is not enough for the strength permitted by the London and Washington treaties. Although large-scale construction has been carried out in recent years, it will not be able to achieve this goal for all classes of warships until six years after the expiration of the two treaties, that is, before 1942. The US naval authorities have also noticed that aviation power is increasingly eroding national defense. The Navy Department has been working hard to implement a plan to increase air force strength, and Congress has also passed it. The Director of the Aviation Office of the Navy Department, Jin Shi, officially announced that the department has built 59 large bombers and has ordered a large number of high-speed and powerful pursuit and reconnaissance aircraft. Although the naval authorities are unwilling to increase the burden on taxpayers due to the international arms race, if other naval powers expand the construction program, the United States must do its best to follow suit for the sake of national security. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The 1933 Strong Warrior Battleship Yearbook was published today, stating that no matter what the outcome of the Qing Dynasty Conference, the world has already fallen into a new era of building capital ships. However, it has not been confirmed that Japanese submarines are equipped with small aircraft, and it is said that 1936 to 1937 will be a prosperous year for naval construction. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Disarmament Representative Nagano held a meeting with foreign journalists on the 4th to explain Japan's disarmament policy. When talking about abolishing submarines, he also vaguely revealed Japan's intention to discuss political issues such as the Pacific defense restriction agreement. After seeing this news telegram, the Japanese naval authorities claimed that this conversation completely contradicted Japan's fundamental principles, and on the 5th, they asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth. Minister of the Navy Okaku also sent a trained telegram to Nagano upon his return, ordering him to be cautious. (Japanese Joint Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Face of the Clock (Part 1) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Once, while sitting on a Shanghai streetcar, I happened to catch a glimpse of a tall building outside the window, and I saw a large clock installed on it. Its form was quite eye-catching, in a novel way. The impression I got at that glance was unusually fresh, like seeing a country girl with thick eyebrows and big eyes after being used to seeing urban ladies with delicate features and slender eyes. This sparked various thoughts in me while I was on the car, and I still haven't forgotten it, so I'm writing down that whimsical thought now.</p>
<p>I remember seeing illustrations of clocks of this type in foreign books discussing "new art." The clocks don't use Roman numerals or Arabic numerals to indicate the hours, but only draw twelve thick, short straight lines, all looking like 1 o'clock. But this was the first time I'd seen a real one in China. The first thing I thought when I saw it was its connection to my personal past: about ten years ago, when I was a teacher at a school, I suddenly found the face of the clock I was used to looking at annoying. Because some of the twelve Arabic numerals seemed to urge me to go to class, some seemed to order me to sleep, some seemed to force me to get up, and some seemed to shout at me to hurry up and catch the streetcar, making me uncomfortable even on holidays. So I took out my oil painting tools, used Cobalt to paint over the entire clock face and hands, and used other colors to draw a part of a willow tree in the upper right corner, hanging down a few willow branches. Then I cut two swallows out of black paper and glued them to the tips of the hands. In this way, my clock looked like a miniature painting in a round frame. Sometimes, when the hands were in the right place, the clock face would display a very pleasing composition. As for practical use, I only needed to recognize that the vertical was 12 or 6 o'clock, and the horizontal was 3 or 9 o'clock, and I could estimate the other times by eye within each 90-degree angle. I was very pleased with this gadget and even duplicated it on the wall clock, turning it into an oil painting. (This was recorded in my Green Edge Hall Notes.) That wall clock is still hanging on the east wall of my home in my hometown. However, I later disliked it again and had already painted over the willows and swallows, now only leaving a white face and two black hands. My family and I had become accustomed to the "wordless clock," and no one asked to add Arabic numerals. Frequent guests were no longer surprised and could even read the time. Several children with sharp eyes could even tell the exact time, down to the minute and half-minute. Because of this past connection, I was particularly concerned about the transformations of clock faces. Seeing that "new art" style clock from the streetcar window that day caught my attention. But now I bring this up not to prove my prescience about "new art" forms. The aforementioned gadget was entirely out of my curiosity and playfulness and had nothing to do with art. It's just that the point of not writing numbers on the clock face coincides with my old experience, so I'm bringing it up again. Now, I think calmly: My method—drawing willows and swallows or painting on the clock face—was too curious at the time, only suitable for my own enjoyment and not worth imitating by others. But as advocated by the new art, I feel that the matter of eliminating Arabic numerals from clock faces is worth discussing, and I might as well chat about it here.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Section Chief Also Participates, Emphasizing the Development of Commerce and Protection of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, diplomatic winds and clouds have been urgent, and the North China issue is becoming increasingly serious. Japanese consuls in various parts of southern China, in order to cope with the current situation, decide on a unified policy, and discuss the development of local commerce and transportation, gathered in Hong Kong on November 30 to hold a South China Japanese Consul Conference. Participants included Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, Mizusawa Kosaku; Japanese Consul in Guangdong, Kawai Tatsuo; Japanese Consul in Fuzhou, Nakamura Toyoichi; Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Yamada Yoshiotaro; Japanese Consul in Shantou, Harada Chuichi; and Sakamoto, the Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of Taiwan, who arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 29th aboard the Guangdong Maru to prepare to participate. Sakamoto previously served as the Chief of the Third Commerce Section of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was assigned to Taiwan in February of this year to serve as the Chief of the Taiwan Foreign Affairs Section. He is not only responsible for all foreign affairs in Taiwan but also serves as an official in the South China Consulate and is a trustee of the Hong Kong Consulate. His mission in participating in the Hong Kong South China Japanese Consul Conference is of great significance. On the 29th, the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong hosted a reception for the consuls at his office to exchange views. According to Okuda Otsujiro, the secretary of the Hong Kong Consulate, this conference is a regular event for South China consuls and has little to do with the North China incident. In this era of economic recession, the South China consuls should convene a meeting to develop commerce and decide on an overall strategy to facilitate progress. Japanese businessmen in Hong Kong were also invited to participate in the meeting, which lasted about three days. The following are the matters that can be published at the meeting: 1. Each consul reports on the local situation. 2. Measures against anti-Japanese sentiment. 3. Discussing methods of communication between consulates in various places. 4. Matters concerning Japanese crew members. 5. Promoting trade and developing commerce. 6. Issues concerning the protection of Japanese ships. 7. Issues concerning the protection of Japanese nationals. After the meeting on the 30th, Mizusawa Kosaku, the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, hosted a reception for Chinese and Western journalists at the Japanese Club at 5 PM to report on the progress of the meeting. It is also reported that Japan will set up a communications headquarters in Guangdong, on the one hand, to be well-informed about news in South China, and on the other hand, to communicate South China's sentiments and adopt a policy of distant alliances.

<p>More than 20 Branch Posts are Set Up Along the Coast, and Provincial Supervisors are Dispatched to Preside</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: There are many smuggled goods imported in the Chaoshan area. The military and police authorities announced a unified land and water anti-smuggling operation on November 1st. The province has dispatched two additional tax squadrons, ten special agents, and five anti-smuggling warships. More than 20 branch posts have been set up along the coast of Chaoshan. Xiao Sheng, the Director of the Chaoshan Anti-Smuggling Division, has been hesitant to comply due to the importance of the matter. The province has dispatched Fan Zhanpeng to Shantou to take charge. The form of the inland anti-smuggling branch posts is equivalent to the former customs and likin bureaus. If goods that have already paid special taxes and special levies are shipped, a certificate from the Agricultural Tax Bureau must be obtained to prove the origin of the goods, which must be presented to the branch post for inspection and release. The merchant who buys the goods at the same time must also be responsible for signing. When the goods are transported to their destination, they must still be deregistered. This is to prevent smugglers from undermining the revenue from special taxes. The province has recently dispatched anti-smuggling supervisors and special agents to Shantou, all of whom are responsible for establishing branch posts. It is said that with strict anti-smuggling measures, the activities of traitors will be effectively prevented.</p>

The Suzhou section of the railway needs to cross Heng Street outside Fengmen (the only bustling market outside the city) and Guan Dianli Street outside Loumen to connect with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Early bridges will be built in both places, and the bridge deck will be the railway, which will also be completed in turn. The citizens outside Fengmen complained to the competent authorities that the culvert was too narrow and the traffic was inconvenient. The Construction Department has dispatched Commissioner Zhuang Xiaozhen to Suzhou to investigate and report back to the province. It is rumored that there is hope for widening and reconstruction. In addition, the Construction Bureau has been ordered by the Construction Department to completely repair the Suzhou Ring Road, which will begin construction immediately. The long-delayed concrete pavement for the sidewalks on the east, west, and central markets in the city center has also been more than half completed. In the near future, the city appearance will be renewed.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Wuxi: Strange News of a Resurrected Dead Person Spreads <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>In the Beiqiao area of the third district of Xiyi, it has recently been rumored that a certain surname died at the age of sixteen. After eight years, his parents called him back to life this spring. Last month, he was planting wheat in the fields. As for the method of resurrecting the dead, one hundred copper coins must be collected from one hundred families with the same surname, and one hundred soy beans must be placed in the coin holes, arranged in the shape of a human on the dead person's coffin, and incense and candles must be burned. The parents or children of the deceased must call the deceased's name next to the tomb at 2:00 AM, noon, and evening every day, one hundred times each time. Each time they call, the dead person will grow muscles on four limbs, and after calling for ninety-seven forty-nine days, the dead person's body will be completely formed and resurrected. Ordinary men and women are running around telling each other, causing a great wave of imitation. Residents such as Huang Dabao of Zhang Jingqiao Cai Lane and various villages such as Caozhuangli, Tangguan Port, and Sifang Bridge, as well as the Liu surname at the foot of the North Licheng and the Fan surname at Yanqiao in the urban area, have taken such actions. In fact, this is absurd and baseless, and the matter is superstitious. It is also rumored that a living Bao Gong has been found in Changzhou, who can cure all diseases, which has been widely spread. Teahouses and taverns are using it as a topic of conversation. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly ban it.</p>

<p>The new road outside Zhongshan Gate in Wuyi County is an important route to the railway station and connecting various highways. It has been in disrepair for years, is rugged and uneven, and the road is narrow, causing congestion for vehicles and pedestrians. Remodeling is urgently needed. The county government submitted a request to the Construction and Finance Departments to widen the road surface to 16 meters. The departments approved an appropriation of 7,500 yuan from the construction funds for this year's projects. The county government has received orders to immediately announce to residents on both sides of Xinfeng Street that they must demolish their houses according to regulations within one month to allow for the 16-meter width. Those who fail to demolish their houses by the deadline will be forced to do so to facilitate traffic and create a grand spectacle. The road surface project will be contracted out through bidding once the houses are demolished. Construction will begin immediately after the demolition is completed.</p>

<p>At 3:30 PM on the 4th, a villager named Tao Youcai, wearing a gray long gown and a black melon-shaped hat, came to the Yangzhou branch of the Bank of China with a receipt for the 16th issue of the Aviation Lottery. The receipt stated, "Received today the first prize of the 16th Aviation Lottery, No. 11168, Article 3, prize money totaling 21,000 silver dollars. This lottery ticket should be submitted to the Aviation Office for verification. This amount was paid on the 2nd of April with a receipt. Respectfully, Shi Xiansheng, Wu Zhao. Signed, Bank of China Yangzhou Branch, through 11.16." The receipt had a seal on the left side. The bank staff suspected it was a forgery.

<p>On the 24th of last month, a ferry capsized in Changheya, Suqian, drowning many people. On the morning of the 2nd, at the mouth of the Liutang River in Shiji, 18 li north of Siyang City, more than 30 villagers were crossing the river on a small boat. The boat was small and overloaded, and it was also windy and rainy. When the boat reached the middle of the river, the passengers lost their composure, leading to the tragedy of the boat capsizing. Except for a few who were rescued, about 30 people drowned. That day was the market day in Shiji. When the news spread, the relatives of the deceased, both men and women, went to the ferry to search for the bodies and hired people to salvage them from the river.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Li Yingcong Proposes Gliding Sport, Seeking National Leaders as Sponsors, Starting a Gliding Study Group in Shanghai <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, believes that gliding is popular in Europe, America, and Japan. This sport is not only the most noble game for young people to temper their bodies and minds but also has the function of preliminary flight training. Therefore, he feels it is necessary to promote it. He is currently seeking national leaders to co-sponsor the initiative and plans to first organize a Gliding Study General Association in Shanghai, and then establish branches in various regions. Central News Agency reporters, believing that this matter is of great importance and will be of interest to the public, visited Mr. Li yesterday. He said: "Gliding has a history of more than 20 years. Initially, it shared the same flight ideals as aviation. Aviation has progressed from lighter-than-air airships to today's heavier-than-air airplanes. Gliding has also gone its own way, with continuous research. Progress has been especially rapid since the European War. Currently, it is not only popular in various European and American countries, but also in neighboring Japan, where they are sparing no effort to promote it. Gliding means traveling in the sky using a glider without relying on engine power or the buoyancy of gasbags. The ascent method can be either by towing with a car, releasing with a winch, or gliding down from a high slope. Then, the pilot naturally rises with the air, manipulating the tail to continue forward, circling, or ascending. The latest record shows that gliding can reach as high as 4,500 meters, travel as far as 500 kilometers, and last for 36 and a half hours. This is a human instinct that has been developed and realized today, which is not surprising. Gliding can be regarded as a form of entertainment, but it is actually a most advanced sport. Sports were initially limited to good days in spring and autumn, with track and field, ball games, and wrestling as the main events. In the past decade, winter skating and summer swimming have become popular, which, in addition to tempering the body and mind, also implies competition with nature on a flat surface. This is progress in sports, but gliding is not limited to seasons, and its significance of competing with the atmosphere is advanced from a flat surface to a three-dimensional one. Therefore, its progress is above all other sports. Moreover, the operation of a glider involves using its tail to adapt to the turbulence of the airflow, which is the same principle as engine flight. Therefore, it can be regarded as preliminary training for engine flight. However, the lowest-priced engine-powered airplane costs more than tens of thousands of dollars, and there are also large amounts of fuel and depreciation costs during flight. A glider may cost less than a thousand dollars, and there are no costs during use. Therefore, gliding is a good way to promote the aviation industry. I believe that gliding is of great significance. Therefore, I plan to invite several national leaders and military and political authorities to initiate and promote it. I plan to first organize a Gliding Study General Association in Shanghai, recruit members, and manufacture gliders and train gliding skills at Longhua Airport. In the future, I also plan to promote it in the interior. If it can be realized as soon as possible, I hope that aspiring young people will actively participate, which will be a blessing for the future of the country and the nation."</p>

<p>Acting Consul General Hosts Reception for Residents Last Night, Lectures on Sino-Finnish Relations Broadcast in Chinese</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 18th anniversary of Finland's declaration of complete independence. Finnish officials and residents in Shanghai took a holiday to celebrate. The acting Finnish Consul General in Shanghai, Max Nygren, hosted a reception for Finnish residents at the consulate on Muirhead Road at 8 PM. At 7:30 PM, a Chinese staff member was sent to deliver a radio address in Chinese about Finland's founding and Sino-Finnish relations. Also, the 15th of this month is the 74th birthday of Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the founding father of Finland and the current President.</p>
<p>Dalu Daily reports that the Nordic country of Finland celebrated its 18th anniversary of independence yesterday (the 6th). Finland has an area of 149,900 square miles and a population of 3.8 million. After separating from Sweden in 1809, it became a semi-independent Grand Duchy under the Russian Empire, with its own government and parliament, and its own currency, enjoying an independent economic life. In 1905, the old four-chamber parliament was merged into a single-chamber parliament, granting women the same social rights as men. In 1917, it declared complete independence. The country's fortunes are improving daily, repairing domestic affairs, strengthening diplomatic relations, and focusing on absolute neutrality in the face of aggregations of special political interests in foreign policy. In a time of national crisis and economic hardship, Finland has been able to weather the storm peacefully. The current coalition government was formed in the winter of 1932. A general election was held during its term. Its President, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, is a veteran of Finnish politics. Although he is 74 years old, he is still energetic and is known as "Old Peter" in the country. Finland's relations with China are very cordial. In 1926, it was the first country to sign a treaty of friendship with China and voluntarily abolished consular jurisdiction. Today, Finnish newspapers express sincere sympathy and understanding for China's difficulties.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Cables Siam to Inquire About Details, Inspection Group to Siam to Depart Next Spring</p>
<p>New Voices News Agency reports that the restriction of Chinese in Siam, which began in the spring of this year, has not stopped. Although Chinese expatriates in Siam have argued with the Siamese government based on reason, it has been to no avail. In the meantime, public outrage in China led to an economic boycott of Siam, with a ban on the sale of Siamese rice. The Siamese government then slightly relaxed its anti-Chinese movement, and the atmosphere gradually eased for two months. However, the Siamese government suddenly imposed heavy head taxes on Chinese expatriates, arresting as many as a thousand people. When the news spread, various overseas Chinese affairs organizations in Shanghai were shocked. A reporter from New Voices News Agency inquired at various overseas Chinese affairs organizations and agencies and was told that they had not yet received accurate information. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing has cabled Siam to inquire about the details. It is also learned that the inspection group to Siam organized by China has been postponed to mid-January next year due to private affairs of the members at the end of the year.</p>

Reports that he would go to Guangzhou and then return to his country via Japan are not accurate. It is also difficult to say when he will return to his country. In short, the future plans of our group have not been decided, and our work in Shanghai has not yet been completed.</p>

<p>Central Bank Announces Foreign Exchange Market Prices Yesterday, 100 National Currency Equals 90.5 Hong Kong Dollars</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government issued an order on the 5th to nationalize privately held silver dollars, and all transactions are limited to legal tender and banknotes from HSBC, Chartered Bank, and Mercantile Bank. It also established a Foreign Exchange Reserve Committee to adjust the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. According to a reporter from New Voices News Agency, banking circles revealed that the Hong Kong government's move is a policy to prevent speculators from harming the interests of legal trade. Therefore, the prices for the purchase and sale of exchange funds and bills of exchange will not be announced to prevent speculators from operating. As for balancing foreign exchange in China, it is not only has no impact, but may even be beneficial. It is hoped that the price of telegraphic transfers of national currency against Hong Kong dollars can be suppressed. The exchange rate announced by the Central Bank this morning (6th) of 100 national currency equaling 90.5 Hong Kong dollars is proof of this. In the past, 100 national currency only equaled about 70 Hong Kong dollars, a difference of 20 to 30 dollars. It is hoped that this loss can be avoided in the future.</p>

<p>The deadline for opium smokers to register in Shanghai is approaching soon. The Public Security Bureau's various precincts, water patrol teams, and detective teams have begun a general mobilization to investigate opium offenders and have dispatched personnel to conduct strict searches of various opium dens. Once caught, they will be sent to the Garrison Command for legal action. At this time, the various anti-opium agencies in Shanghai believe that although opium offenders are defiant of the law and beyond redemption, their ignorance is also pitiful. To show compassion for the ignorant and encourage them to surrender so that they do not violate national law and regret it later, they will continue to publicize and urge opium offenders to finally awaken. The Juvenile Propaganda Corps will also continue to publicize and assist in anti-opium work after the anti-drug rally. Yesterday, they also requested dozens of propaganda materials from the Public Security Bureau to distribute to citizens when they set off. Although the Public Security Bureau is currently in the investigation period, it will also continue to publicize to avoid punishing those who have not been educated.</p>

After the speech, a declaration was issued and a photo was taken before the meeting adjourned. The following is an excerpt of the inauguration declaration: "The Supervisory Committee of this newspaper, etc., resolved to formally swear in on December 6, sincerely acknowledging the importance of the trust placed by the union and the earnest expectations of society. We will certainly devote our foolish sincerity and bear this arduous task. The changes in the world are severe, and our fear increases. We dare not fail to continue the spirit of past struggles and encourage future progress. Therefore, we hereby reveal our innermost thoughts and announce our guidelines as follows: First, the thorough implementation of the spirit of service. Our postal workers' service has always taken benefiting the country and society as the premise. At this time of international turbulence and frequent domestic disasters, looking around, we are more determined in our ambition. We sincerely hope to work harder and strive together with people from all walks of life to turn the tide in the middle of the stream and promote the revival of the country. Postal service is one of the transportation industries, and what it concerns is of utmost importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our postal workers dedicate themselves to it. How cautious, motivated, dedicated, and committed should we be in order to seek the development of the postal service's future? Three days to maintain the postal system. The perfection of postal services has always been praised by people from all walks of life. The reason for this is that it relies on a sound and good system. However, as time passes and circumstances change, those who take the opportunity to destroy it emerge one after another. Our postal workers strive to protect the postal service for the sake of the postal service and for their own sake. The past traces of protecting the postal service are still clearly visible. In the future, we should continue this spirit and implement our original intentions. If anyone attempts to undermine our sound and good postal system of more than ten years, we will regard them as public enemies and vow to do everything in our power to deal with them, even if it means going through fire and water. Three days to consolidate the internal organization. This union has gone through many difficulties to achieve what it is today. This long and glorious history is all the result of long-term struggle. However, there are still many obstacles and dangers have not been subdued. In the future, we should consolidate our front and unify our steps to fight against the harsh environment. All our members, under the leadership of the National Postal Workers' General Union, must unite in good faith, fully support, strictly abide by discipline, and obey orders in order to strengthen the entire force and consolidate a permanent foundation. Fourth, to increase the welfare of members. The greatest mission of this union internally is to strive for the welfare of members. Relying on the efforts of past committees and the supervision of all members, considerable achievements have been made. In the future, we should actively carry out our work to satisfy the expectations of members. Everything from the growth of intelligence, the improvement of life, and the expansion of careers must be planned and promoted to be realized. Uphold the purpose of mutual assistance and use the strength of collective efforts, without pursuing empty talk or being biased, so that all members can enjoy the rights they deserve. The above four points are the entire guidelines for the future efforts of this union. We will certainly follow this goal, move forward bravely, and work hard to live up to the heavy trust placed by the two members and the earnest expectations of society. This is our declaration, December 6, 24th year."</p>

<p>It was resolved to request the Ministry of Industry to allocate funds for subsidies and to reply to the Netherlands Indies Chamber of Commerce to proceed together.</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce expressed its support for the plan of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands Indies to build a Chinese Pavilion in Batavia to develop trade in Southeast Asia. However, the construction costs are huge, and it was resolved to request the Ministry of Industry to allocate funds for subsidies so that the project could be completed as soon as possible. The following is a verbatim record of the Federation's reply to the Netherlands Indies Chinese Chamber of Commerce: "Reply: We have examined your letter stating that you intend to build a Chinese Pavilion in Batavia, following the example of Annam, and hold a national goods exhibition during the night market in August next year. You have specially requested Consul General Song to return to China to contact and prepare for it. Upon receipt of this, our association immediately convened the main factories in Shanghai and Consul General Song to discuss the matter together. As a result, we all believe that the cost of constructing the Chinese Pavilion is too much for manufacturers to bear at a time when Shanghai's industry is extremely depressed. It should still be requested by your association and our association, etc., to earnestly request the Ministry of Industry to allocate funds for subsidies. As for the invitation to factories to come to the south for exhibitions, our association, etc., will convene all manufacturers in Shanghai to organize a solicitation committee to prepare for it on a regular basis. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Industry to allocate subsidies for the construction of the Chinese Pavilion and convening Shanghai manufacturers to discuss and proceed with it on a regular basis, we should record the case and send a letter to your association, so that you can check and request the Ministry of Industry to allocate subsidies for the construction of the Chinese Pavilion again in order to realize it. With sincere public friendship,"</p>

<p>The Suzhou Creek, a key waterway in Shanghai, has been silted up for many years, making the river narrow. The congestion of ships causes great difficulties in water transport. Since the Wusong River Conservancy Committee and the Shanghai Bureau of Public Works began to carry out dredging work in sections, the section from Laozha to Beixinjing has been completed, and the work from Yujidun to Jiwangmiao has also been underway for a long time. Now that winter has arrived, the tides are low and the water is shallow. There is still a large amount of silt that was piled up on the north and south banks, below the river banks and river bends of Fanwangdu, Caojiadu, and Xiaoshadu during dredging. It has not yet been removed, which is very inconvenient for ship traffic. Starting yesterday, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works dispatched a large number of workers to transport the accumulated silt to ships and vehicles for land and water transportation to other places to facilitate water transport.</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Zhabei Charity Group Requests Allocation of Funds for Congee Distribution <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Distribution will begin on the 25th of this month, and appeals for relief are made to all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The Second Congee Distribution Site of the Zhabei Charity Group on Liuying Road has been in operation for many years. The director of the Zhabei Charity Group, Wang Binyan, presides over it. Every winter, congee is distributed daily to the poor people in various parts of the city, with more than 15,000 people going to eat. Now that the severe winter is approaching again, the group plans to continue distributing congee starting on the 25th of this month and has applied to the Municipal Government and the Social Bureau for an allocation of $2,000. It also appeals to all sectors of society for relief. The original presentation is as follows: "Zhabei is close to the concessions, and laborers and poor people gather here. Every winter, our group has always set up factories to distribute congee. We have now received instruction No. 11920 from the Social Bureau, which states that this year's floods in various provinces are extremely severe, and the countryside is barren. The general public is suffering from disasters, and the poor people who are fleeing famine are flocking to Shanghai. In addition, due to the fatigue of industry and commerce, and the failure of all undertakings, it is difficult for the poor people to obtain food and clothing. The situation this year is special, and it is even more necessary to organize congee distribution. We have been instructed to prepare for congee distribution as soon as possible. We have followed the order and are actively preparing. On the one hand, we have applied to the Municipal Government for an allocation of funds to start the business in order to promote it. At this time of severe weather and sluggish market conditions, the number of unemployed people is large, and the bankruptcy of the countryside is increasing. The large and small factories in Zhabei have not yet recovered, and the silk factories are worried about the lack of raw materials and are mostly closed. The general public is suffering from hunger and cold, which is very pitiful. We have no choice but to follow the order and prepare to distribute congee at the Second Congee Factory on Liuying Road. In addition to instructing craftsmen to repair stoves and houses in advance and to build sheds to protect against rain and snow, we will choose a day to open the business as soon as we have raised a large amount of money. We are specially appealing to all sectors of society, hoping that benevolent gentlemen and ladies will save these hungry and cold people. The merits and virtues are limitless. No matter money, rice, or cotton clothes, please send them to the Accounting Department of our group at Zhongdatong Road, Beidatong Road, Xinzha Bridge. Any little bit of support is welcome. In addition to sending letters to wealthy gentlemen, we will not engage in sporadic fundraising outside. This statement is attached for your public information."</p>

<p>Liang Kehe, hiding in Huaian, was arrested and brought back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The North Sichuan Road Post Office robbery, in which the notorious monk Wukong and his gang used weapons to steal over 90,000 yuan on the morning of September 9th, fatally shooting two and wounding one, was previously reported. Detectives from the Avenue Foch police station went to Funing and other locations in northern Jiangsu, capturing Wukong and several of his accomplices, who were then interrogated and sentenced by the First Special District Court. It has now been learned that another accomplice, Liang Kehe, also known as Liang Ziming, nicknamed “Little Guangdong” or “Little Erzi,” who received 5,000 yuan of the stolen money, has been apprehended. Since the incident, he had been hiding in Huaian, northern Jiangsu. Detectives who originally handled the case learned of his whereabouts and quickly obtained official documents from the First Special Court, secretly traveling to Huaian at night to work with local military and police forces to capture Liang. He was then transported back to Shanghai and brought before Judge Xiao of the First Special Court for interrogation yesterday morning. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, briefly described the robbery and Liang's capture, requesting that Liang remain in custody for further investigation. Liang Kehe admitted to participating in the robbery and receiving 5,000 yuan from Wukong. He claimed to have used 2,000 yuan to buy land in his hometown, while the remaining 3,000 yuan was entrusted to his mistress in Shanghai, who later claimed it had been stolen. Judge Xiao ordered Liang Kehe to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Woman Lu Wenying Arrested for Allegedly Running Gambling Den and Inciting Murder. Police Request Extension for Investigation Due to Complexities. Lu Wenying Admits to Running a Brothel, Denies Other Charges. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Local woman Lu Wenying, also known as Lao Qi, 35 years old, residing at No. 55, Hujiage, Fahua Town, western Shanghai, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. At 9 PM that evening, while picking up clothes at a tailor shop at No. 5, Yurenli, Yunnan Road, in the Public Concession, she was recognized by Inspector Qian Chenglong of the French Police. Lu was suspected of running a gambling den and of involvement in the murder of Shao Wenbin (a.k.a. Ma An A Liu) on the night of July 28th, 1933, at the intersection of Route Wagner and Route Grog. Inspector Qian, along with detectives Zhang Ziying and others, coordinated with the Old Gate Police and proceeded to No. 5, Yurenli, Yunnan Road, where Lu was arrested and taken to the French Police Station. Yesterday, she was transferred to the Second Special District Court for questioning. At 3:30 PM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo and court recorder Gao Yanmao arrived at the First Criminal Court to interrogate the defendant. The defendant's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Ma Shouhua, were represented by lawyer Hua Maosheng. In court, the defendant's age and origin were questioned. She stated that her name was Lu Wenying, 35 years old, from Nanxiang, currently residing at No. 55, Hujiage, Fahua Town, with the nickname A Cui and that people call her A Qi, but she doesn't have the name Lao Qi. Her husband worked on a ship and passed away on July 16th of this year. She has an elderly mother and two children, ages 19 and 17. In 1930, she opened a ham shop at No. 114, Avenue Haig, which she has since sold to someone else. At this point, lawyer Gu Shouxie from the Jinwu Office stood up to state the case, saying that the defendant was arrested last night at 9 PM. Two years ago, the defendant organized a gambling den. When the gambling offenders were arrested at that time, most of them confessed that it was organized by the defendant. The police department arrested the defendant without success. In addition, there is suspicion of inciting murder, and the court issued an arrest warrant. Because the defendant's whereabouts were uncertain, the defendant was not arrested until last night. The police department requested a longer period to investigate the case in detail before filing a lawsuit. In court, the defendant confessed that she had been living in Hujiage for three years and that she went to Yurenli last night to pick up a silk cotton robe for her child because no one in the countryside turns silk cotton. However, she has never run a gambling den. When I ran a brothel before, anyone could come and have fun for a yuan. People from gambling gangs often came to have fun, and I结怨诬咬阻止因他们吵闹不许到我妓院里来,我麻将亦不懂和数,那裏會做花會因开妓院嘈杂,故于二十二年間盤興別人开设,自己即迁住法华胡家閣,更无叫人杀人之事,我是女流之輩,焉有能力要殺人,亦不知法院要拘捕我,如果我要知道,亦不敢再到上海来了等语. Then the defendant's lawyers stated that they have no objection to the Police Department's request for an extension of the investigation but asked for a shorter time to avoid impeding the defendant's freedom of body, and they demanded that the reform should be shorter and more closely inquired and the Police Department's investigation may be taken. After discussion in court, the remote theory was changed to be heard again at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Tibetan Representative Attending Sixth Plenary Session Loses Belongings in Shanghai: 300 Yuan in Cash, 13 Ounces of Saffron, Etc., Stolen. Song Kanbu Sues Andong Hotel for Theft. <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Song Kanbu, a lama from Sera Monastery in Tibet, was summoned by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to attend the Sixth Plenary Session. After the meeting, he took a night express train to Shanghai on the 30th of last month. Upon arriving at the North Station, a greeter from the Andong Hotel at 123 Hubei Road approached him and offered his services. Song followed him by car to the hotel and checked into Room 157. Initially, Song's luggage was stored in the accounting office, but it was later brought to Song's room. As it was late, Song did not open the luggage. The next morning, he discovered that 300 yuan in cash and 13 ounces of saffron brought from Tibet to give to relatives and friends (valued at 60 yuan in Tibet, but worth 300 yuan in Shanghai) were missing. Song believed that he had been very careful along the way and that there was no possibility of losing the items. Therefore, he suspected the hotel. He negotiated with the hotel, and Andong offered to subsidize Song with 60 yuan as travel expenses, but Song refused. He then filed a lawsuit against the hotel with the First Special District Court, accusing them of theft. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Ninth Criminal Court for questioning. Yao Yunfang, the hotel's accountant, and Wang Chuanbi, the hotel's lawyer, appeared in court on behalf of Andong. According to Song's statement, the accounting office took a long time to deliver the luggage after he checked into his room, which raised suspicion. Yao Yunfang stated that the hotel could not be held responsible for the loss, as the location of the lost items was unknown. He filed a counterclaim, accusing Song of defamation. Judge Dai reviewed the statements and adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 2 AM, a fire broke out at the Wang Shengxing Silk Mill, located at No. 297, Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road in the South City. The fire spread rapidly, quickly engulfing the roof and spreading to neighboring buildings. Fire brigades from various districts of the South City responded to the alarm, rushing to the scene with pumps to extinguish the fire. The fire was finally extinguished at 3:30 AM. The Wang Shengxing factory and its surrounding structures were completely destroyed. Neighboring structures at No. 295, the Chu Jinji pig bristle workshop, No. 299, the Zhengde Silk Mill, and No. 293, an overpass building, were also affected. When the fire broke out, the workers in the Wang Shengxing factory were fast asleep. When they realized what was happening, they tried to escape, but the stairs had already burned, and the fire was raging. They were trapped by the thick smoke and had no way to escape, ultimately perishing in the fire. The factory manager, engineer Shi Zhijun, managed to escape, but his chest, back, and buttocks were burned. He was transported to Qu Zhibu Hospital for treatment. Firefighters found three charred bodies at the scene, which were unrecognizable. Factory workers identified the deceased as Shi Jixun, 14 years old, the son of Shi Zhijun; Zhang Fengbao, 26 years old, from Chongming; and Yu Qianglang, from Chongming, both workers. The West Gate Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau dispatched police officers to investigate. The local Baochang, Lu Zhaoxiong, was ordered to report the incident to the Shanghai Local Court and request that personnel be sent to the scene for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Public Prosecutor Kong Xianglin and Inspector Shen arrived at the scene to conduct the autopsy. The cause of the fire was said to be due to an electrical fault in the motor inside the Shengxing factory. It was learned that the affected families had large amounts of fire insurance. Wang Shengxing Silk Mill had fire insurance of 1,500 yuan with Zhaotai Bank and 1,500 yuan with Yongning Bank. The Chu Jinji pig bristle brush factory at No. 295 had 5,000 yuan of fire insurance with Yongnian Fire Insurance, and the Zheng Qingji Weaving Factory at No. 299 had 3,000 yuan of fire insurance with Yongning Fire Insurance. The Bureau is currently investigating the matter.</p>

After the incident, Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Cai Jingjun, Detective Squad Captain Ji Yuanpu and Vice Captain Wang Huibai, ordered the Xinza Gate Branch Director Liao Jiongran and Detective Squad Captain Bao Ziying and Vice Captain Shi Zuhan to solve the case as soon as possible. Captain Bao and Vice-Captain Shi then ordered Team Leaders Liu Changpei and Li Guiqing to investigate the case. Around 12 AM the day before yesterday, Detective Yang Yucai received a report that the murderer who shot Tang was hiding in the New Bridge Street area of the French Concession. After receiving the report, Captain Bao and Vice-Captain Shi personally led detectives Yang Yucai, Zhang Shuwen, Cai Jilin, Zang Nai, and Mao Gongzhao to the location. They spotted the suspect walking in the road. As they had not yet reported to the police station, the detectives followed the suspect to the Xieqiao Liyuan Road area under the jurisdiction of the West Gate Branch in the Chinese Concession, where they worked with guard Chen Gui to apprehend him.

<p>Song Pinshan, a young owner of Song Hengfeng distillery, 29, from Maojia Town Street, Haimen, Jiangsu, seduced Liu Chenshi, a Suzhou woman and the wife of Liu Xiangtai, owner of Liu'an Hotel, who this year turns 35, in the winter of 1933. After having an affair with her, he repeatedly borrowed hundreds of yuan, then defrauded her of gold jewelry valued at 800 yuan. He also seduced her second daughter, Lan Ying, to cohabit. And with Lan Ying, after Lan Ying was abandoned by her brother-in-law, Deng Guihao, who had seduced her and made her pregnant, he caused Lan Ying to file a complaint against Deng Jianhao in the Second Special District Court, resulting in him fraudulently obtaining 8,000 yuan. Later, Liu Chenshi demanded that Song return the borrowed money and jewelry, Song not only ignored her, but took his wife and fled to Shanghai. Liu Chenshi then filed a complaint with the Haimen County Government, accusing Song Pinshan of seduction and inciting murder. The county government approved the suit and summoned him. Song refused to appear, knowing that Song was working as a teacher at Jixian Elementary School on Ganstang Road in the French Concession, the county government transferred the document to the Special District Court, requesting assistance in arresting him, Song then moved to No. 525, Xiude New Village, Chengdu Road, in the Public Concession, which made it impossible to arrest him again. Recently, Liu Chenshi made a special trip to visit Shanghai to find him, and on the 29th of last month, the two met on Xinza Gate Road, where she took Song to the police station and transferred him to the French police station, who transferred him to the Second Special District Court. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution on charges of undermining morality and financial fraud. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened the court for questioning, the plaintiff Liu Chenshi requested that the defendant be temporarily detained, pending notification to the Haimen County Government to come and pick him up. The details have been recorded in the newspapers of the 3rd of this month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang continued the trial at the First Criminal Court. First, the plaintiff Liu Chenshi claimed that she filed a lawsuit in Haimen County in June of this year and that the trial was held in September. Later, she also submitted documents to this court. Now, she has telegraphed the Haimen County Government to request that someone be sent to pick up the defendant. Yesterday, someone from Haimen came to Shanghai to say that a robbery and murder case had occurred in Xiasha, Haimen, and the county chief went to the countryside to inspect the body. He has public affairs, which are busy and cannot be handled in time. It will take a few days to pick him up. The defendant Song Pinshan stated that the plaintiff said in court last time that I committed fraud, but there is no evidence. I have not committed any fraud. After the court reviewed the statements, it told the police department's lawyer that this court had reviewed the documents from the Haimen County Government. The plaintiff in this case first filed a self-prosecution in Haimen County. The defendant was not present, and no one was found in detention. He asked this court to assist, but he was also unable to arrest the defendant. After verifying that the crime location of the defendant in this case was in Haimen, and the self-prosecution case was in front, this case should be accepted and tried by the Haimen County Government. This court will transfer the defendant to Haimen, what are the opinions of the police department? The police department representative, lawyer Gu Shouxie, replied that the court shall handle it in accordance with the law, and the police department has no objections. Therefore, the court made a ruling in court that this case would not be accepted, and the defendant would be temporarily detained in the detention center, pending the Haimen County Government sending personnel to come and pick him up for interrogation. After the discussion, the court adjourned, and the defendant was taken down and imprisoned in the detention center.</p>

<p>In early June of this year, the Shenhu-line Jili steamboat was robbed by bandits, resulting in a significant loss. Subsequently, Guo Mengshu, the leader of the Northern Station Branch of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, along with Qian Tianxiong, Shen Jinchu, and others, apprehended the bandit Gu Jinrong involved in the case. They also recovered stolen goods, including twenty-one bolts of spun silk, five catties of silverware, and several blades. These were handed over to the Procuratorate of the District Court. After a clear investigation, the case was prosecuted in the criminal court. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court for the trial. The plaintiff, Wang Zengqing, testified that he was fifty-four years old and worked as an executive in the Silk Industry Association. In June of this year, when the Shenhu-line Jili steamboat arrived at Zhoujiadu, two hundred and nineteen bolts of spun silk, a large amount of silverware, banknotes, and foreign currency were stolen. Seven people, including Li Asheng, had previously been arrested and sentenced to six years in prison. Now, the stolen goods and bandit Gu Jinrong had been apprehended, and he requested that the law be applied. Gu Jinrong, the defendant in custody, testified that he was thirty-something years old, from Songjiang, and worked as a boatman. As for the spun silk and silverware, he claimed that they were purchased with money he had earned from his daily work and denied any robbery, asserting that he had been falsely accused and seeking investigation. Guo Mengshu, the leader of the Detective Team Branch, then appeared in court to recount the circumstances of the arrest.

<p>— Jinhua Ting</p>
<p>—Specimens, Models, and Physical and Chemical Instruments—</p>
<p>In recent years, the China Bookstore has been increasingly striving for excellence in its contributions to education, sparing no effort. In addition to extensively inviting scholars and experts to strive to improve textbooks and teaching materials for schools at all levels, it has established the "China Educational Supplies Manufacturing Plant" to engage in the manufacturing of specimens, models, and physical and chemical instruments, in order to supply the education sector nationwide, to facilitate teaching and increase the effectiveness of education. This newspaper believes that the education sector nationwide should have a full understanding of the content of the factory, so it visited the factory the other day. We were grateful for the guidance of Manager Hu Tingmei and the directors of various departments, and we were grateful for the detailed explanations. The establishment process and content and products of each department of the factory are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) The Process of Establishment</p>
<p>The China Educational Supplies Manufacturing Plant was founded by the China Bookstore. It was established in 1927. The factory site was originally located on Jiayu Road in Hongkou. At that time, it was dedicated to manufacturing specimens and models, which were designated as "China Specimen and Model Factory". In July 1932, "China Instrument Factory" was added to Oujia Road to engage in the manufacture of physical and chemical instruments. Later, due to insufficient production to meet the needs of society, a new factory building was built at No. 721 Zuming Road. By July 1933, the new building was completed, and the two factories were merged. At the same time, efforts were made to expand the scope, and five departments were set up for metalwork, woodwork, paintwork, electroplating, and assembly, to manufacture physical and chemical instruments and educational supplies, and fifteen departments were set up for microscope slides, anatomical injection, collection, insects, combing, peeling, bones, drying, soaking, carving, blank making, writing, coloring, assembly, waxing, and globes, to manufacture specimens and models. At the same time, it was renamed "China Educational Supplies Manufacturing Plant". In April of the following year, a clock-making department was added, dividing the entire factory into three major workshops. Recently, the factory has acquired the house next door to the east and opened it as a botanical garden, with plans to cultivate raw materials for the manufacture of specimens. Since its establishment, it has been eight years, all of which have been managed by Mr. Hu Juntingmei. At present, the factory's equipment is becoming more and more complete, and its products are becoming more and more refined and rapid, enough to supply the needs of educational institutions nationwide.</p>
<p>(2) Content and Organization</p>
<p>The entire factory is divided into three major workshops. Each workshop is equipped with a director and an engineer to plan the various products in the workshop and to supervise the manufacture and research of all the workers in the workshop. The first workshop has more than 100 workers and is divided into five departments, namely (1) the assembly department, which assembles the parts made by other departments into a complete tool; (2) the electroplating department, which electroplates gold or silver on metal tools to make them beautiful, and is currently designing to add lightning-plated chrome equipment; (3) the painting department, which paints various tools or toys; (4) the woodworking department, which uses various woods to manufacture various tools or toys; (5) the metalworking department, which manufactures physical and chemical instruments and tools, most of the machines used in this department are manufactured by themselves, such as the machine for making steel pen plates. The director is Wo Baodi, and the engineer is Wang Weizhi. Mr. Wang is currently the director of the Experimental Workshop of Jiangsu Provincial Educational College and a professor of physics. He is currently designing and manufacturing economic instruments, which will soon be available. The second workshop has more than 100 workers and is divided into fourteen departments, namely collection, insects, plants, microscope slides, peeling, bones, drying, soaking, modeling, blank making, writing, coloring, assembly, and globes. The sole task of this workshop is to manufacture models and specimens. Models are divided into two types: wax and paper. Specimens are divided into two types: system-made and soaked. Among them, the "Microscope Slides Specimens" are the most worthy of our attention. This type of specimen is divided into nine categories: 1. Animals, 2. Plants, 3. Physiology, 4. Fetus, 5. Human Pathology Bacteria, 6. Applied Microbes, 7. Minerals, 8. Rocks, 9. Natural History, with a total of six or seven hundred kinds. Among the nine categories, the most valuable should be human pathological microbes. Because it is extremely dangerous to analyze pathological microbes and manufacture specimens, and if you are not careful, there is a risk to your life, and only China can manufacture this type of microbial glass slides specimen in China, and natural history specimens. It is specially prepared for junior high schools or complete primary schools. The director is Hu Zhenfu, and the engineer is Du Qixi. Mr. Du has a bachelor's degree in biology from Soochow University and is a researcher at Shanghai University. He once served as the editor of the Natural History Department of the Commercial Press. The third workshop has more than 60 workers and is divided into five departments: sampling, metalwork, mold making, assembly and verification. The main work of this workshop is to manufacture monthly, daily, weekly, hour, and minute clocks. The director and engineer is Ruan Shunfa. Mr. Ruan has served as a sampling designer at Xiang Sheng, Hefeng, Old Shipyard, and Zhou Cai Dao Iron Factory. In addition, there are two departments for experimentation and research, so that experimentation and research can be carried out on the main products at any time. The director of the experimental department is Mr. Zheng Zhangcheng, who holds a doctorate in biology from Harvard University and is currently the dean of the School of Science at Shanghai University. The director of the research department is Mr. Ling Wenzhi, who has been the editor of the Natural History Department of the Commercial Press for 22 years.</p>
<p>(3) Main Products</p>
<p>The main products of the factory are roughly as follows: (1) Physical instruments, (2) Chemical instruments, (3) Natural history instruments, (4) Human physiological pathological models, (5) Animal, plant, and mineral specimens models, (6) Microscope slides specimens, (7) Craft specimens, (8) Boy Scout equipment, (9) Various stationery, (10) Monthly, daily, weekly, hour, and minute clocks, (11) Large and small globes, (12) Astronomical instruments, each of the above products is attached with a manual in four languages: Chinese, English, German, and Latin, so that the teaching of schools at all levels can benefit.</p>
<p>(4) Recent Contributions</p>
<p>The factory is rich and determined to be more refined and improve. It never sticks to the old methods for various products. Every time it adds and manufactures, it considers again and again, improves with all its heart, and researches, experiments, and designs new ones, in order to contribute to society. The recent products of the factory are briefly described below: (1) The monthly, daily, weekly, hour, and minute clock does not require constant attention. Just turn on the clockwork, and it can automatically report the month, day, week, hour, and minute. It can run for 22 days and is very accurate. It is the most advanced poem clock in the world. It was invented by Mr. Ruan Shunfa. He devoted himself to research and spent a lot of effort. It took two years to complete. The internal structure of this clock, whether it is the clockwork or the parts, is completely manufactured by itself. It was reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Industry in September this year and approved a ten-year patent. It can produce five units a day and is now officially on sale. (2) Boy Scout Equipment, experts are responsible for guiding the manufacture of all the supplies used for Boy Scout training, and the planning and manufacturing have now been completed. (3) The results of microscopic observation are the most reliable. The factory has added equipment and spent a year, and has now produced various microscope slides specimens, such as animals, plants, minerals, physiology, embryos, and pathogenic bacteria, applied microbes, etc., which were previously sought from foreign countries, but now they should be available in the book. (4) Economic instruments, in order to reduce the difficulty of promoting science education, the factory has specially designed and manufactured economic instruments by Mr. Wang Weizhi. At present, the type A electromagnetic real instrument and the type B first set of physical instruments have been completed. Only the electromagnet of the type A economic instrument electromagnetic experimenter can be used for twelve types of lightning magnetic experiments, such as electric bells, telephones, and telegraphs. The type B economic instrument first set of only 97 pieces can be used for mechanics, heat, and acoustics. There are 678 different experiments, with a thick detailed manual, which will be available soon. (5) Educational toys, in order for schools and families to obtain excellent toys, so that children can play useful games, the factory has also specially designed and manufactured many types of educational toys by Mr. Wang. This type of toy has a beautiful appearance and many changes. Children can play with it for a hundred times without getting tired of it. It is scheduled to be released on New Year's Day next year. (6) Microscope Photography, manufactured by Mr. Zheng Zhangcheng, consultant and director of the experimental department of the factory. Mr. Zheng is currently conducting precise research. According to Mr. Hu Juntingmei, this microscope photography has made considerable progress and will be successful in the near future.</p>

The original text is extracted as follows: In recent days, the situation in North China has been precarious, and a few bad elements have actually been used to instigate so-called autonomous movements, lose sovereignty, and undermine unity. It is extremely painful to say. We young people study hard and should not interfere in politics. However, the national situation is so critical that we cannot bear to sit idly by. Any political organization formed by shameless villains, in the name of autonomy, is actually a traitorous act. All our domestic leaders who can maintain national territorial integrity and sovereign unity, we will do our best to support them to the death.

<p>Autonomy in Name is Actually Ceding Territory to Others Unanimously Condemning to Seek National Territorial Integrity</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Union issued a declaration on the North China situation yesterday, saying that since the September 18th Incident, the pressure of foreign aggression has increased year by year, and the life of the nation has become more and more precarious, but the hearts of the people have not died, and the day of revival can be expected. Efforts to build, and many difficulties are enough to make the country prosper. Therefore, the recent great unity of party and national leaders and the new decision of internal and external policies are the concrete manifestations of our country's national salvation and survival and arduous struggle. The whole country, up and down, should follow this spirit, work together with one heart to protect the country and resist foreign insults, so that the country can turn danger into safety, and the nation can have a day of equality and freedom. However, Yin Ni Rugeng and others, brazen and shameless, willing to be puppets, dared to betray the central government and falsely organize, implement autonomy in name, and are actually ceding territory to others. All people with blood and energy, there is no one who does not grind their teeth and hate. A little shame and evil heart should know that this is a great rebellion. Since the rebellion of Yin Ni, there is still a group of frustrated politicians and unemployed gangsters who see the same thing and stir up trouble in various parts of North China. Seeing that the birthplace of our ancestors and the area where cultures have gathered throughout the ages will be sent to others by a group of insane people, this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We are for the nation</p>
<p>, for the national culture, for the lives and property of the people of North China, the only thing is to unanimously condemn, to seek the integrity of China's territory and the unity of the central government. This is a declaration.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>So they looked up at the glittering stars in the sky, listened to the fragrant grass under their feet, and quietly listened to the chorus of crickets. Robert suddenly said again, "Mommy, Mommy will take a long time to come."</p>
<p>"I don't know why the Creator needs night; isn't daytime much more interesting?" Nan thought to herself.</p>
<p>"It's for people to sleep," Robert replied with a yawn.</p>
<p>"Then go to sleep," Nan said angrily.</p>
<p>"I want my own bed. Ah, I can't wait to see Tanty!" Robert shouted. Hearing the chirping of returning birds in the small nest deepened his longing for home.</p>
<p>"I don't believe your mother will find us," Nan said, feeling anxious and confused. She was impatient for all waiting. "It's so dark here, she won't be able to see us."</p>
<p>"That ice house was pitch black, and I was so scared that I didn't dare to make a sound, but she still saw me; so now, no matter how dark it is, she will always see me," Pan Bo replied with great confidence. At the same time, he stood up and looked into the distance in the dark sky, wondering if there was any news from the savior who had never disappointed him.</p>
<p>"I see her! I see her!" he shouted,勉强dragging his tired little legs and struggling to run towards a slowly moving black shape. Suddenly he stopped, then spun around, stumbled back, and shouted in horror:</p>
<p>"No, it's a bear, a big black bear," he said, hiding his face in Nan's skirt.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Tension in the West Youth Basketball League - Xie Xing Forcefully Defeats McLennan - 41 to 36 - Five Matches Tonight at the Hu <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Xie Xing basketball team gathers Fudan athletes and adds the tall and slender Xu Heng as a forward, making it quite strong. In this season's West Youth Basketball League, it won its first match by a large margin against Nanxing. Yesterday, it encountered McLennan for the second time. Relying on its initial momentum, it scored repeatedly and eventually returned triumphantly with a score of 41 to 36, creating a great record of two wins in two battles.</p>
<p>McLennan's Disorganized Lineup</p>
<p>McLennan was originally a top team among the Western teams, with a reputation comparable to that of the Pirates in the past. However, this season, many of its athletes have returned to their home countries, and only a few old players remain, such as Pirelli, Mao Fei, and Levinski. The replacement players have less experience, and the entire team's lineup is disorganized. The team also lacks confidence in throwing baskets, which led to its being at a loss in the first half when facing the agile and brave Xie Xing players. In the second half, the internal connections gradually became more skilled, posing a considerable threat to Xie Xing. However, because of the previous losses, it still lost by five points.</p>
<p>Many Fouls on Both Sides</p>
<p>Due to the intense competition, there were many fouls on both sides. McLennan's Griffis and Xie Xing's Weng Renan, Shu Changge, and Xu Heng were all ejected from the field for four fouls. McLennan's supporters also accused the referee of being unfair, causing a great uproar. In fact, McLennan's players' movements were excessive, both stiff and unclear, and they only blamed the referee after losing.</p>
<p>Xie Xing Gains the Upper Hand First</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Xie Xing gained the upper hand. After McLennan's surrounding basket throw failed, Weng Renan took the lead in scoring. Zhou Dayun wandered under the basket and scored four times, immediately making the score a dazzling 10 to 0. After Weng Renan added another point, McLennan made a major adjustment to its lineup, which indeed led to a turning point. Taonuoer scored a long shot after Xu Heng scored two points. Xie Xing's Zhang Jinxiang also succeeded in a sneak attack, and the score became 18 to 2.</p>
<p>McLennan Follows Closely</p>
<p>After that, McLennan's offense and defense gradually got back on track. "Horse Face" Pirelli scored a hit in front, and Griffis relied on his tall stature to throw in three balls in the back, chasing the score to 10 to 18. The competition became increasingly tense. The Xie Xing athletes, with the determination to break the pot and sink the boat, fought unremittingly. Zhang and Weng, both guards, also launched attacks from time to time while defending, and Qiu Guangxie coordinated in the middle, covering all aspects. Weng Renan was ejected from the field with four fouls. Before long, the whistle sounded, and both sides stopped the game to rest. Xie Xing was ahead with a high score of 27 to 15.</p>
<p>Tense Final Situation</p>
<p>The continuation of the game showed McLennan to be even sharper, but many throws went over the basket and failed to enter. Taonuoer got the ball and mistakenly passed it to Xu Heng, who seized the opportunity to go deep into the basket and scored two points first. Qiu Guangxie then shot successfully from the left side of the field, and the score became 31 to 15. McLennan, seeing the bad situation, worked hard to attack, charging left and right, and frequently fouling. After Pirelli scored three points, he was so eager to steal the ball that he almost had a head-on collision with Xu Heng. Fortunately, Xu knew the importance of forbearance and did not argue with him, so he was able to pass safely. When the score was 36 to 27, Xie Xing's Shu Changge was fined and ejected. The replacement, Li Yunze, had more courage than strategy and became the target of McLennan's attack, chasing the score to 34 to 41, only seven points behind. In a dangerous situation, except for Heng, who was also fined, there were fortunately less than three minutes left. Xie Xing changed from attack to defense, and McLennan failed to achieve its goal. Only Pirelli scored two points. In total, Xie Xing still won by five points.</p>
<p>Observations on the Two Teams' Skills</p>
<p>Looking at the two sides' skills, McLennan's defeat was due to its disorganized lineup and inaccurate basket throws. Xie Xing's victory was due to the entire team's effort, especially Zhang Jinxiang, Zhou Dayun, and Weng Renan, who worked the hardest. However, there were still few changes in tactics, and more research should be done. Then, even if the Pirates are strong, it will not be difficult to achieve the goal and wash away the shame of the Hua team's previous failure.</p>

However, according to information obtained by a reporter from Shanghai News Agency yesterday, the competition was affected by disagreements among one or two schools, leading to a standstill of the entire event. This was quite unexpected.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Letter from Fudan University Cross-Country Team Clarifying the Change of Date for the Jiangnan University Competition <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the Fudan University Cross-Country Team states: "Dear Sir, We read in your newspaper's sports column yesterday a letter from the Guanghua Cross-Country Team, which contains many misunderstandings. We hereby provide the following explanation: The Jiangnan University cross-country competition was originally scheduled by the committee to be held at 2:30 PM on November 30th at Jinan University in Zhenru. However, due to heavy rain on that day, it was postponed. According to Mr. Yu Hengzhi, the chairman of the committee, it was proposed to reschedule it to December 4th or 5th. Later, Mr. Peng Wenyu, the director of physical education at Guanghua University, suggested that the 4th would be more appropriate. Therefore, the committee decided to hold it at the same location at 2:30 PM on that afternoon. However, on the evening of the 3rd, Mr. Peng Wenyu of Guanghua raised two reasons to the committee chairman for requesting a change of date: first, because the Chinese Football Association had a match between their school and Youyou on the afternoon of the 4th; second, because the school was holding an exam starting at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. The committee's view was that it seemed inappropriate for the school to request a change of date because of a match with the Chinese Football Association, as Guanghua was a member of Jiangnan University and should prioritize Jiangnan University. Other competitions should be postponed. As for the school holding an exam, the football team would also not be able to compete. Since the football team had a match, the cross-country team could certainly compete as well. Therefore, the committee did not accept the request. At that time, Mr. Chen Bingde of our school was also present and, seeing that the two sides were unable to reach an agreement, suggested making a slight change to the time to avoid sacrificing studies. The committee chairman then decided to move the event forward to 12:00 noon on the 4th. This is the true story of how the date was changed. The Guanghua Cross-Country Team is unaware that the authority lies with the committee and claims that Fudan did not agree to change the date, which is ridiculous. It should be known that the Jiangnan University Sports Association is organized by various universities, and all issues in various competitions are the responsibility of the committee. Whether or not to change the date is decided by the committee, not by Fudan. Furthermore, the Guanghua Cross-Country Team also stated that it deeply wishes to have a friendly match with our team on any holiday, which is a great honor. Our team only knows that the purpose of the competition is, first, to improve skills, and second, to strengthen relationships. We know nothing else. We are ready to welcome the Guanghua University Cross-Country Team to our school at any time for guidance. We are afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so we have sent this special letter. With best wishes, Fudan University Cross-Country Team, December 6th."</p>

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, there was no initial trading in the area of current affairs. However, a large number of long positions from a major investor continued to be released or reversed to short positions, and the Jin Gang continued to sell, making the market atmosphere quite depressed. In addition, long companies felt that their appetite for gains had been satisfied, making the situation quite weak. However, there was no lack of long positions on the table, resulting in a final rally at the close. Overall, the prospects were still difficult to be optimistic about, because the market price was still at its peak. Yesterday's trading was still done in three sessions. At the opening in the morning, No. 4 was the most active seller, and Nos. 35, 54, and 78 were also sellers. Although a considerable amount of Nos. 43, 46, and 48 were bought, the market atmosphere was suddenly depressed, but the supply and demand were still disparate, and the market price fell by a small amount, from 0.1-0.2 yuan to about 1 yuan. It was heard that a major investor had reversed from long to short. In the second session, the market was still weak, and the selling was slightly weaker, while Nos. 11, 14, 16, and 43 had a strong appetite for buying, so although the previous listed stocks still fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan, the market gradually became firmer after the close. At the end, two or three stocks rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan to about 0.3 yuan, and the wind seemed to have turned slightly again. In the afternoon session, it was said that the news from North China had improved, and the temporary short positions on the table were covered. The selling of No. 4 suddenly stopped, and there was even some buying. Nos. 35 and 54 also turned from selling to buying, and the market situation suddenly turned to a peak, rebounding sharply. The demobilization bond rose sharply by 1.1 yuan. However, the upward trend at the end was slightly killed. In terms of the prospects, according to the table, the long positions were being released, and the large investor had reversed to short positions, making it difficult to be optimistic about the market price. As a result of yesterday's market price, there were mixed gains and losses. Most of the previous listed stocks were slightly better by 0.1 yuan to 0.35 yuan, and the last listed stocks were slightly lower by 0.1 yuan to a rare 0.45 yuan.

<p>The yarn market turned upward, and the situation was still firm, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to grasp. However, most peers are inclined to sell short because the price has entered a high level. However, the amount of money dragged in by the banking sector and the Gold Gang has never been released, and they absorbed and added to their positions in large quantities when the price was low. The competition between the long and short sides was fierce. According to the news in the afternoon, the saying that the market price of Tianjin cotton yarn has soared by 5 yuan, the market once again took a step forward.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Standard Yarn Dafu Advances Sharply <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Due to the tense situation in North China, there was a lack of buyers in the standard yarn pre-market closing, and the opening prices for all months were low. However, the price rose slightly when the second session was shot, because the cotton market was soaring. The third close continued to be good. As a result, the near months rose by 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far months were unchanged. The opening in the afternoon was suddenly tight. Dafu and a certain bank purchased in large quantities, and Changfeng also came to cover short positions. The market price then advanced step by step. However, Dafeng, Daji, and Yichang sold out when the price rose. The closing was stable. As a result, each month rose by 1.5, 1.6, 1.8 yuan to 2.1 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning.

<h3 id="e167">Daily Business Absorbing: Recent Cotton Price Surges by 9.5 Jiao <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending strong, with an unusually severe situation. As soon as the market price dips, various parties compete to buy, causing the market to jump by six or seven jiao. This demonstrates the strong determination of buyers. According to another source, Japanese businesses have been continuously buying up to 50,000 to 60,000 dan in the past three days. Financial institutions are also absorbing cotton and holding onto it. Tong Kee is steadily increasing its positions. However, general traders are uniformly selling off, it is said.</p>
<p>Recent Cotton Continues to Rise and Be Purchased</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for spot cotton saw consistent declines across all months due to weakness in both American and Indian cotton, coupled with sluggishness in the yarn and cloth markets and persistent tension in the northern region without concrete solutions. This led to dampened sentiment and a lack of buyers in the market, causing declines of two, three, or four jiao across all months. Unexpectedly, during the second round of trading, near-term contracts suddenly jumped by five to seven jiao. Upon investigation, it was found that Japanese businesses were heavily buying near-term contracts, leading to a drying up of supply on the trading floor. However, traders uniformly sold off far-term contracts aggressively to reduce their positions. The second and third rounds of trading remained unchanged. As a result, near-term contracts rose by five to six jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, while far-term contracts rose by five fen to two and a half jiao. In the afternoon opening, Chang He and Tong Kee continued to buy, and Da Fu also aggressively sought to acquire cotton, further strengthening the market. Consequently, all months rose by two and a half to four jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Mei Kee sold 2,800 dan, Yi Yu sold 2,400 dan, Da Kee sold 1,900 dan, Yuan Da sold 3,600 dan, Zhen Da sold 3,500 dan, Yi Chang sold 4,700 dan, Xin Cheng sold 6,400 dan, Yu Da sold 1,900 dan, Ming De sold 1,800 dan, Run Kang sold 2,500 dan, and Tong He sold 1,400 dan. Da Fu bought 5,600 dan, Tong Kee bought 6,800 dan, He Xing bought 2,200 dan, Sen Kang bought 2,100 dan, Da Chang Cheng bought 5,400 dan, Chang He bought 16,800 dan, Xin Cheng bought 2,600 dan, Xie Cheng bought 1,300 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang bought 1,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices, as well as closing prices, for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday's opening of the American cotton market was sluggish. Old cotton fell by one pound, while new cotton rose by two pounds. Traders placed limit orders to buy. There were buyers for October contracts because Wallace stated in Chicago the day before that regardless of the High Court's decision, the cotton industry still needs to be managed. Afterwards, many had to settle positions. Cotton farmers hedged their sales, and New Orleans sold off, softening the market. January contracts had some slight demand. However, traders feared the possibility of stopping sales of March contracts due to excessive cotton inventory. Before the close, some traders bought and covered short positions, resulting in a slight firming. Current demand is calm, and the ground remains solid. Spot prices fell by five pounds, while futures fell by one to six pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures fell by two to three points. Indian cotton speculators engaged in buying due to unfavorable harvest reports. European exporters made slight purchases, while Japanese merchants made slight sales. Ping Guoer and Aomula fell by 0.25 rupees, while Bai Luo Xi remained unchanged (Electric dispatch on the 5th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi cotton on the 6th was 223 rupees, down 1.75 rupees from yesterday's closing.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning's opening of the flour market saw an exceptionally buoyant atmosphere across all months, with fluctuating prices and considerable activity. The initial prices were quoted based on foreign wheat, with a difference of one jiao compared to Chicago prices and slightly less, one or two jiao, compared to Canadian prices. Consequently, the spot month once reached three yuan upon entry. Forward months also followed suit, down by one or two fen. However, after the second round of trading, the situation drastically changed. Although large holders sold off in large quantities, new bullish accounts also bought as much as possible. With the forces evenly matched, prices rose by two fen. After the third round of trading, trading remained active, but prices slightly returned to flat. It is estimated that the half-day trading volume reached a massive 900,000+ bags, demonstrating the fierce competition. During the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere was initially favorable in the first two rounds, with bullish forces being stronger and prices showing no signs of decline. However, after the third round, the positive market suddenly plummeted. One rumor claimed that the factory's telegram for continuing to order foreign wheat had been transferred. Another rumor stated that the foreign wheat loan might be established. This caused significant panic, leading to widespread selling, resulting in a decline of six or seven fen compared to the early afternoon session and four or five fen compared to the previous day's closing price. The future situation will depend on the foreign wheat situation, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s wheat futures market, both in the morning and afternoon openings, showed a consistent decline across all months. Although foreign wheat quotations showed little fluctuation, the market atmosphere, since the introduction of foreign wheat, has not been as strong as before, both inside and outside the industry. This is because foreign wheat is being harvested, and the import and sale of old wheat in our country at depreciated prices seems inevitable. As a result, sentiment is weak, buyers are scarce, and prices have been gradually softening, resulting in a decline of three to eight fen. Spot wheat trading has not been active. Medium-grade wheat is being quoted down by one or two jiao. Kaitiantai wheat is quoted at 4.76 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 4.7 yuan, and second-grade wheat at 4.6 jiao, with 600 bags handled by Xin Da.</p>

<p>(Southern Shanghai) Yesterday, over 40 sources arrived from various groups (totaling over 8,000 shi). The local market started active but then turned stagnant. Packers continued to handle over 4,000 bags from Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihai, etc. Thin rice prices remained stable, and Su Tong japonica showed no gains or losses. Only Southern Port early indica rice showed sluggish sales and a slight drop of a few fen. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan showed no major fluctuations.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, over 60 sources arrived from various routes along the river. White japonica rice sales on the market were stagnant. Stockpilers opportunistically made slight moves, but prices weakened again. Early indica rice followed with a slight drop of nearly one jiao. Thin rice sales were normal, and prices were soft. Yangjian high-quality rice prices were firm, while medium-quality rice prices were weak. Port-branded rice prices were stable. Du Kejian rice showed no gains or losses. White round-grain rice sales weakened, and wine merchants remained inactive, with prices down by one or two jiao. Other rice varieties also showed weakness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, customer indica rice arrivals remained strong, with new arrivals from Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. However, sales were limited to local single-source inquiries. Customer stockpilers completely stopped buying. Customer groups, except for supplying river rice, lacked interest in customer indica rice. Stockpilers, after briefly continuing their purchases the day before yesterday, held back yesterday, causing sentiment to decline. High and medium-grade rice prices dropped by a small three to five fen. For the whole day, 1,738 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,812 bags of Taiwan-Ningbo rice, 1,000 bags of Fujian indica rice, and 100 bags of Anqing rice were opened, all of which were handled by the local market. Foreign rice prices remained firm on both sides, and due to very low inventory levels, sales have not started.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market continued to be active. Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei green teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi continued to have active sales channels. However, due to limited inventory, suitable goods for sale are in short supply. Local Zhen Mei pearl tea also showed slight movement in the market yesterday. Yi He, Tong Zi and other companies are all buying, and several local factories have started work, showing slightly more vitality than before.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed slight improvement, but ultimately lacked the strength to rise. The association set a price of 11.85 yuan for spot coarse raw white sugar, up by five fen, and 6.8 yuan for transshipment goods, but no transactions occurred. The original price of Benchang Mianbai Zhenji No. 1 remained unchanged. The Sugar Industry Taiwan Production Company held a tender yesterday. Of the 2,260 bags of Five Rams Guangdong coarse white sugar, 310 bags were sold at 21.8 yuan. The remaining 1,470 bags of No. 1 Guangdong soft white sugar at 21.05 yuan and 1,166 bags of No. 4 sugar at 20.085 yuan lacked buyers. Dong Chi and No. 9 sugars were quoted at their original prices without any transactions. However, 8 hao Dongbai spot goods with the YT mark were sold at 21.65 yuan, and transshipment ET mark goods were sold at 6.65 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mitsubishi, HSBC and other warehouses received a total of 24,500 sheets of East White Iron. The amount of circulating goods on the market has increased, and current market prices are slightly lower than before by two or three fen. It is reported that various groups in the Yangtze River inland waterway shipped a total of 3,400 to 3,500 sheets. Local traders and construction groups have no sales channels due to weak actual sales.</p>

<p>Since the price of purple copper trended higher, the local market has become optimistic. Copper factories and other manufacturers have been vigorously buying, resulting in many transactions. Prices have risen from 44-45 yuan to over 50 yuan. In recent days, due to high asking prices, there have been no buyers, and the market has suddenly become quiet. Prices are gradually loosening, and it is said that prices of 45-46 yuan can now be obtained, but wholesale asking prices are still around 50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Tinplate Market: Existing Goods are Very Scarce <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Since the League of Nations imposed economic sanctions on Italy, Italian tinplate has effectively stopped coming to China. Local traders, factories, and customer groups rushed to buy upon hearing this news. In recent days, Italian goods have been purchased, and there are concerns about running out of stock. As a result, the amount of goods circulating in the market has become scarce. Standard prices have become strong. For example, 90-pound single-layer goods are estimated at 17.5 yuan, and double-layer goods are estimated at 36 yuan. 100-pound single-layer goods are out of stock, and double-layer goods are quoted at 38 yuan. It is reported that over 300-400 boxes were traded yesterday. It is said that Huacheng, Nanyang, Fujiashing, Meikangyuan and other factories are all adding to their inventory.</p>

<p>Although the harvest of Tianjin red dates is abundant this year, current market prices are already low. Recently, with increased sales, the trend is tightening. High-quality goods have been quoted for around 400 packages. Date heads are priced at 16 to 15.5 yuan, high-quality first-grade red dates are priced at 14 yuan, and third-grade red dates are priced at around 11 yuan, up by varying amounts of four to five jiao.</p>

<p>Previously, due to the scarcity of high-quality daylily, medium-grade goods were quoted at 18.12 yuan. The other day, over one hundred packages of high-quality goods were opened, with prices at 18 yuan and 17.8 yuan for the next grade, showing a slight decline compared to before, but there is no expectation of further loosening.</p>

<p>Worsted wool fabrics have been trading actively, with local traders and those along the Beijing-Hangzhou route continuing to add to their purchases, but mostly in small quantities. Western-style suit fabric sales have been particularly broad. Riding breeches, herringbone patterns, Polish overcoat fabrics, flat thick fabrics, double-sided yellow camel fleece, French West lining horse brown satin, etc., have continued to be produced. However, the ordering business from foreign firms has been very quiet. With foreign exchange and tariffs stalled, importing worsted wool fabrics requires an additional two to three fen. Agents report that the prices still need to be increased, and although the Shanghai market is gradually shouting for higher prices, it is difficult to reach two fen. Furthermore, with rumors rampant in Tianjin, the spring market is difficult to predict. The worsted wool fabric industry has no interest in ordering in the future.</p>

<p>— (Rong Yu)</p>
<p>A person who rises from hardship, poverty, and lowliness has two ways of treating people: one is to vent all the anger of his former frustration on the current miserable and lowly people. He thinks that if you don’t accept my anger, you must find a way to rise up like me. This kind of person is inevitably mean and unfeeling, and logically difficult to last. The other is to think about the hardship I suffered in the past, and now in my hands, I will no longer give him hardship. This is extending oneself to others, which is in line with the great path of loyalty and forgiveness. Therefore, I dare to advise people who come from hardship to be kind and not to be jealous and forget their roots.</p>
<p>In this world, as long as one has a strong body, it is a general happiness. If you have a wealth of possessions but are often sick, what is the point? So I changed two ancient poems: "Having strength is enough for everything, being without illness makes one light."</p>
<p>The older one gets, the mind should keep up with the times. If the mind does not keep up with age, then it is "decrepit," "stubborn," and an antique. In Europe, America, Japan, and other powerful countries, their rulers, business leaders, university professors, etc., although old, their minds are still a progressive and active youth, so they can do things with such results.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Before Life and After Death <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Xianggen is dead! This news came from the mouth of another old school janitor.</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman with a white headband on her bun, leading a child wearing a plain hat, always holding two seemingly frozen tears, went in and out of the gatehouse.</p>
<p>The male students' argument: "Who told him to eat two dumplings, four taels of eggplant skin wine, and spoil his stomach!"</p>
<p>The female students' argument: "A woman whose husband dies should wear hemp, but Xianggen's woman only wears a white headband, which is too inappropriate!"</p>
<p>No one at the school authority mentioned Xianggen's aftermath. It is said that the body is still lying on the board without a coffin for burial. It seems that his death has nothing to do with everyone and is less regrettable and noticeable than the death of a monkey in the zoo. There is also a reason for this: Xiang Xian'gen had no good feelings for him when he was alive.</p>
<p>It is often heard that people rebuke him:</p>
<p>"Borrow money, borrow money, the previous one hasn't been paid back, and now you're opening your mouth again. You just go play the lottery, drink, gamble, and have fun, as if someone owes you. You're really too shameless. What about your monthly salary? You're really a muddlehead, a bastard. To be honest, I won't lend you next time..."</p>
<p>Once he also opened his mouth to me. He hoped that I would get first place and a scholarship. However, I still disappointed him after all. I didn't have any money, and he was naturally disappointed, and I was also uneasy. Five days later, he got sick and died. It was still the faculty who had a bit of compassion and randomly donated dozens of dollars to his wife for the funeral.</p>
<p>"You also give a little bit, for example... he borrowed bits and pieces from you when he was alive." Another old janitor earnestly pleaded with the male and female students and also raised dozens of dollars. The old janitor led the woman with the white headband in to thank him. A look of black worry appeared on his forehead:</p>
<p>"Xianggen is dead, and someone will take care of him, what about myself, I...?" His mouth twitched.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Record of the Tianquange Fine Arts Exhibition <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— By Ear</p>
<p>The Tianquange Calligraphy, Painting, Inkstone, and Fan Exhibition, which has been brewing for a long time, opened on the 29th at the Lake Society and is scheduled for seven days. Today is the last day. I have visited it for several days. The first day was purely for calligraphy and painting, and on the second and third days, inkstones and fans were added, which were dazzling and beautiful. The most noteworthy were the Song and Yuan collection handscrolls, which were collected by Mr. Qian Zeshi. Xia Taichang's "Wind and Rain Bamboo" had many inscriptions by his contemporaries. Sheng Zizhao's "Jiangtian Fishing Music Picture" is also a memorable work. Chou Shifu's imitation of Liu Songnian's "Autumn Crossing Picture," a small green and blue landscape hanging scroll, has Qianlong's jade seal and Liang Jiaolin's collection seal on it. This is genuine, and Chou's craftsmanship is very impressive. It is not something that ordinary weak and stagnant works can compare to. What is particularly awe-inspiring is Fang Zhengxue's rubbing of Yan Lugong's "Magu Immortal Altar Record," with a postscript by Hai Gangfeng. Loyal and virtuous cooperation can be called a triple perfection. Among the fans, there were ten small fans from the Inner Court, painted by Tang Dai and written by Zhang Ruoxia, which were exquisitely beautiful. There were also more than one hundred Xiangfei bamboo bone fans of various sizes. Among the inkstones, there were ceramic inkstones handmade by Gao Nanfu and Zhao Wenmin's "Song Xue Qi Chen Ni Inkstone." On that day, the number of visitors reached thousands. In the afternoon, Guizhou Road was crowded with traffic. Buyers were from the financial sector, such as Xu Jiqing, Shen Laiqing, Qu Jigang, Qin Yingchun, Shen Jixuan, and Zhou Shouliang. Those in the literary and artistic circles, such as Li Yaoke, Zhou Jianyun, Mei Lanfang, and Liu Haisu, and collectors such as Ye Yuhu and Zhang Congyu, were particularly enthusiastic. The famous painter Feng Chaoran also came to the meeting to select countless fine works. I asked the owner about this, and he said that it was the gold tycoon Wang Boyuan who invited them to choose. Zhang Weirush bought several fans worth a fortune, which was also a heroic act. I feel that our country's culture and art urgently need to be promoted, so I write this to inform those who care about art. The impact on the world after the opening of the London exhibition was great and significant, but our people were indifferent. If the powerful did not promote it, it would be laughable to foreigners.

<p>Episode 20: Tender and charming, she passes through the courtyard, pitying the moonlit face; spirited and enthusiastic, she scolds her son-in-law, listening to the golden lion's roar from the next room.</p>
<p>Then there was no sound, only the sound of light footsteps. The director came out again and walked past the window sill. Then the woman was heard laughing and saying: Look, our master is so obedient, I told him to go, and he left. Why should a woman be afraid of a man? The more you fear him, the more he will show off his power. Sister Hu said: This is because our young lady has a different background, and they dare not compare with your wife. The wife said: That's true, but women should always raise their own status. As long as they think in their hearts, I can find a man wherever I go, then they don't care about men at all. If they want to make trouble, they make trouble, and if they want to break up, they break up. What other way can men bully women? You take my words and tell that young lady that using my method is correct. At worst, he doesn't want that young lady, which is very good. That young lady can be considered to have escaped the net. He, as a master, will never go after a poor person to recover the dowry money, right? Sister Hu laughed for a while following her voice and didn't reply. The wife said: Women's hearts are all the same. Think carefully about what I said, is it right? Then there was Sister Hu's chuckling laughter. Bei Hai, in the room on this side, felt so bored after listening for so long that he sat down by the table. Because there were ready-made paper and pens on the table, he picked up the pen and wrote on the paper. Although this woman is not good to her husband, standing in the position of women, she can be considered a promoter of women's rights. Zhiqian, standing in the distance, smiled and nodded twice when he saw this note. Then the woman was heard saying: Since the girls here have to sell themselves for food, there must be many people who want to sell themselves. Do you have any such people on the road? I would like to buy two leaders in Xi'an. When Bei Hai heard this, he looked up and made eye contact with Zhiqian, and also smiled. He still had the pen in his hand, so he soaked it with ink and completely blotted out the lines he had written. (372)</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Problem of Prostitution <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— (Madman)</p>
<p>Prostitution seems to be a cancerous tumor of urban sin. It is a public form of prostitution for some women, who rely entirely on their sexual organs for a living. Its existence is a great shame and insult to the women's community and an exposure of the social pathology. Rescuing prostitutes is a major task of the women's movement. But how far have our women's movements come in recent years?</p>
<p>The economic state of real society, no matter what kind of enterprise, is covered with the calamity of birth and decline. Women in the turmoil of the great era, they have lost all the sustenance of life? I have to sell my only sexual organ as an exchange for living conditions. Is this the sin of prostitution itself? This is indeed a question worthy of study. At the same time, in the abolition of prostitution, we must confirm the causes and consequences of prostitution, especially pay attention to the terrible environment.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Xiling, the screenwriter of Mingxing Company's new film "Boat Woman," grasped this important current women's issue, hoping to rekindle the past wave of enthusiasm in the silent women's movement and shout out for the suffering and helpless prostitutes. The provision of this women's issue has fulfilled the mission that the film should bear.</p>
<p>For those engaged in the women's movement, "Boat Woman" boldly shows the problem of prostitution, which has become one of the links in the entire social problem. You should take a further step to explore the fundamental elimination of prostitution. Where do the thousands of prostitutes in the city come from? How did their parents sell their daughters? What irrational system is in chaos? I arrived at these keys and engaged in reform work, then its effectiveness will never be weaker than the negative rescue work.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Crab Stories <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, perhaps on a mid-September evening, we were gathered around a kerosene lamp eating lake crabs. My father suddenly put down the crab he was eating, wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, his face filled with such dejection and sorrow, his eyes moist. We were all surprised and suspicious, and no one dared to put another crab in their mouths. But father finally told a crab story in a faint voice, and as he spoke, he was weeping: (What follows is a tragic tale my father told my mother)</p>
<p>"Although it was twenty years ago, I still remember it very clearly, almost as if it were yesterday: Now when I eat crab, I think of this matter, and at the same time I think of the irreconcilable murderer of my father - he is now the administrative commissioner of my hometown, holding all the authority in the village, ×××. Although I have thought about avenging my father, I hate that I am also a weakling, so I have never had the courage to do so: Now I watch my enemy swaggering around, oppressing the people in my hometown. But myself? Still a wanderer in a strange land... But every time I see or eat crab, every time I think of my father's tragic death, and at the same time I think of the pomp and power of the murderer, besides crying at home, or secretly shedding a few tears, I can only feel ashamed, curse my own fate, and resent myself for being so useless!"</p>
<p>"My father died for crabs, and I myself have wandered here because of crabs, becoming a person who can never return home!"</p>
<p>"Originally, we were a fishing family, and had not changed our profession for generations, just making a living by the water. My family had two fish ponds, two fishing boats, and more than ten acres of floating reeds. Besides my father working as a fisherman all year round, sometimes my mother and sisters would also help to row the boat and cast the net. I was still young at that time, so I just stayed at home to look after my younger brother."</p>
<p>"The fishing season was during the Major Production Festival, only one winter each year. Our life during the year depended on the harvest of this winter. The sporadic catches at ordinary times, such as catching shrimp and crabs, could only be used to supplement our daily expenses. However, in our area, whether it was fish, shrimp or crabs, there were often people who came to steal them from the ponds, so even in the middle of the night, we had to go out to patrol to see if there were any thieves. Moreover, at that time, there was a ××× who specially hired several people to steal fish in this fishing village. He had great power, so although everyone hated him with all their teeth, no one dared to do anything to him. Everyone only gave him a nickname "King of Fish Thieves" behind his back."</p>
<p>"Only my father often went to confront him, so he hated my father almost to the bone."</p>
<p>"One day - it was the beginning of September, when lake crabs should be on the market, so my father went to catch crabs and check the fish seedlings in the pond as usual every night. But when my father got near the reeds, he saw two dark figures quickly darting into the reed clumps: My father was quick-witted and chased after them and caught one of them, while one escaped. My father threw him into the mud, forcing him to say who had instigated him to steal. He knelt on the ground begging, and told my father everything, and returned all the stolen crabs to my father. My father was satisfied and let him go back."</p>
<p>"The next day, my father went as usual, but he didn't come back until after dusk. He knocked weakly on the door, coughing and groaning. My mother opened the door and helped him to the bed. I only saw him covered in mud, holding his heart with his hand, constantly spitting out blood. Many places were covered in blood. When he took off his clothes, there were patches and strips of wounds on his body! My mother was so anxious, crying and shouting, asking him what had happened. He finally told her everything from beginning to end, and said:</p>
<p>""These people were sent by ×××, my enemy is ×××""</p>
<p>"My father died of overwork a week later, so my mother took me and carried my younger brother to the yamen to complain, but they were ultimately powerful, so it ended without result due to insufficient evidence."</p>
<p>"From then on, my mother worked hard to raise us, selling all the fish products to provide for our lives and education. She said:</p>
<p>""Children, throw away this bowl of bitter rice. You'll die of heat in the summer and freeze to death in the winter. Your father lost his life to a strongman for this bowl of rice. You should change your profession!""</p>
<p>"So, we embarked on this path of life."</p>
<p>My father was already sobbing as he spoke, so we also shed tears as we looked at the big pile of crabs on the table, and my mother was heartbroken and sobbing!</p>
<p>Now, every time I see those live, crawling crabs in the wire knots and flower pots, it seems that every one of their feet is scratching and crawling on my heart, making my heart sad, and finally I can't help but think of the tragedy my father described—</p>
<p>My father told this story twenty years later, and it happens that I am writing this novel twenty years later. Calculating it, it has been more than forty years since the tragedy occurred!</p>
<h3 id="e190">Adjustment and Calibration Steps for Superheterodyne Receivers <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Fuping</p>
<p>The adjustment circuit of a superheterodyne radio is the most complex. The natural frequencies of each stage are not completely the same as those of adjusting a tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver. Therefore, at first, this type of radio was difficult for ordinary people to use, except for a few trained technicians. Since the invention of single-knob tuning, most tuning capacitors are installed on a single shaft, so as long as a dial is turned to any point, the tuning circuits of each stage of the radio are precisely matched. Factory-made radios are, of course, carefully inspected before leaving the factory, but afterward, they are unfortunately subjected to strong vibrations, or the user carelessly tampers with the calibrated compensation capacitors and intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier tuning capacitors, causing confusion. Although all the components of the radio are not damaged at all, its entire fate has been ruined. Unless there are sophisticated instruments and experienced technicians, it is difficult to restore its original glory. How to re-calibrate a superheterodyne radio that has been disrupted is indeed some practical knowledge that we amateur researchers must know.</p>
<p>The necessary instrument for calibrating a superheterodyne receiver is an accurate test oscillator (it must at least include the intermediate frequency and broadcast band). Its manufacturing method has been described many times in this publication, so there is no need to repeat it. Now let's start talking about how to use this test oscillator to calibrate a superheterodyne receiver.</p>
<p>The first step to calibrate is the IF amplifier tuning circuit. The most common frequency for the IF amplifier is 175 kHz, but there are also other frequencies such as 465 kHz. These are noted on the back of the radio or in the instruction manual. If the IF amplifier has changed from its original frequency, the symptoms are like poor selectivity, squealing heterodyne, and repeat points. For the calibration method, first match the frequency of the test oscillator so that it is exactly equal to the intermediate frequency specified for the radio. Remove the oscillator vacuum tube from the radio and connect the "antenna" end of the test oscillator output to the control grid of the IF amplifier tube (if there is more than one stage in the IF amplifier, start calibrating from the last stage first). Modern radios mostly use screen grid tubes for the IF amplifier, so connecting to the control grid only requires touching the copper cap on top of the vacuum tube: Connect the "ground" end of the test oscillator (usually the isolated case of the oscillator) to the cathode of the IF amplifier tube. Turn on the radio. At this time, the speaker should emit a squealing sound. The test oscillator is best to use already amplitude-modulated (AM). Otherwise, the IF amplifier stage of the radio must be oscillated first. Use a small screwdriver with an insulating paper layer on the iron rod to prevent short circuit danger from touching the chassis. Insert it into the IF amplifier transformer and rotate the adjustment screw of its secondary tuning capacitor, paying attention to the volume emitted by the speaker, and rotating it to the loudest level. It would be more accurate to use an "output meter" instead of a speaker to indicate. Repeat the same method to calibrate the previous stage IF amplifier, making sure that the entire IF amplifier section completely matches the specified frequency.</p>
<p>After the IF amplifier stage is calibrated, the next step is the oscillator stage, which is also the most important point in the entire process. Now the removed oscillator tube can be inserted. Connect the "antenna" and "ground" terminals of the test oscillator to the "antenna" and "ground" terminals of the radio, respectively. Set the test oscillator to the high-frequency end of the broadcast band, for example, 1480 kHz, and then change the capacity of the compensation capacitor attached to the oscillator stage tuning capacitor until the maximum output is obtained. At the same time, the test oscillator must be tested with several frequencies in the broadcast band, because the frequency difference between the oscillator stage and the high-frequency amplifier and the first detector stage may not be able to maintain the intermediate frequency at any point on the radio scale. If the numbers indicated on the radio dial are the calibrated frequency numbers, it will be of great help when calibrating the oscillator stage. We only need to pay attention to whether the frequency indicated on the dial is the same as the test oscillator when the radio output is maximum, and we can determine whether the compensation capacitor of the radio oscillator stage has been calibrated.</p>
<p>The high-frequency amplifier stage and the first detector stage are the last step, which is relatively the easiest, and the method is the same as calibrating a TRF radio. Just match the natural frequencies of each stage tuning circuit to be the same as the input signal frequency, and the speaker or output meter will indicate the maximum output. This completes the entire calibration process.</p>
<p>If we do not have an expensive "output meter", we can also use a milliammeter to replace it. Connect a 0-5 milliammeter to the plate circuit of the second detector tube. If the detection system uses the grid negative voltage method (usually called plate detection), the plate current indicated by the milliammeter is also the largest when the radio output is maximum. If the detection system uses the grid leak capacitor method (usually called grid detection), the index of the detector tube plate current is the smallest when the output is maximum.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Shortwave Radio Using a Single Coil <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The shortwave radio to be introduced in this article is one that can receive various shortwave bands using only one coil. The diagram below shows the circuit of the radio. Because its structure is quite simple, it is very suitable for beginners to make. The values ​​of each part are detailed in the diagram, so there is no need to repeat them here. Here, I will only tell readers how to make the coil:</p>
<p>Take a cylinder with a diameter of one inch and a length of three inches, and wind ten turns of No. 26 double silk-wrapped wire at a distance of half an inch from one end. This is L1 shown in the diagram. The winding head should be connected to the grid of the detector tube, and the winding tail should be connected to the first tap. Next, wind seven turns at about half an inch away to form LN, with the winding head connected to the first tap and the winding tail connected to the second tap. Then wind 24 turns again at a distance of half an inch to form L3, and after connecting to the second tap, wind one turn in the opposite direction to form L5. L4 is formed by winding three turns in the middle of L1 and L2, with the winding head connected to the choke coil and the winding tail connected to the plate of the detector tube. Except for L5, all coils are wound in the same direction, and the winding method is close winding.</p>
<p>When using a variable capacitor with a value of 25 uuf (maximum) and 100uf (minimum), the wavelength range that can be received: 16528 m for L1, 25S38M for L1L2, and 45S55M for L1L2L3.</p>
<p>The regenerative (or feedback) coil includes L4 and L5. This is the most special point of this machine. If this regenerative coil is changed to one, that is, if the number of turns is reduced to make it oscillate at a shorter wavelength, it will not oscillate at a longer wavelength. If the number of turns is increased, the oscillation at a shorter wavelength is too strong, so the screen grid voltage in the detector tube must be reduced, and the sensitivity is reduced. Therefore, it is impractical to use only one regenerative coil. To solve this problem, two regenerative coils are used. When using L1 or L1L2 to receive radio, only L4 has feedback effect. When using L1L2L3 to receive radio, L4 and L4 simultaneously act as regenerative coils to provide feedback.</p>

<p>— Jue Ming</p>
<p>3. The Impact of Meteor Showers on Radio Waves</p>
<p>In 1921, while Mr. Bickel was experimenting with 800-cycle radio waves, he saw a large meteor, and at the same time the radio emitted a lot of noise, so he presumed that this noise was caused by the radio waves being affected by the meteor. On the other hand, Dr. Nagaoka of Japan also made the same discovery.</p>
<p>So what is the impact of these meteors and meteor showers on radio waves? According to the research of Dr. Nagaoka of Japan, he excluded all other factors that could affect the radio waves when the Earth passed through the meteor shower, and focused on studying the impact of meteors, measuring the reception intensity. The result is shown in the first figure.</p>
<p>(1) The impact of meteors on radio waves is shown in Figure 1A. O in the figure is the day with the most meteors, in other words, the time of passing through the central part of the meteor shower. Sixty days before this day O with the most meteors, the radio waves had already been affected and changed. This impact reached its peak 18 days after the day O with the most meteors. Sixty days later, the impact had not completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(2) However, if we talk about ordinary meteor showers in general, the fluctuations in their impact are somewhat different. Usually, as shown in Figure 1B, the radio waves have been affected and changed 60 days before the day O with the most meteors. The impact reaches its peak 22 days after the day O with the most meteors. The impact begins to disappear 80 days later.</p>
<p>(3) Conversely, if receiving signals from Nauen, Germany, across the Atlantic Ocean, the impact is exactly the opposite of the above two examples. These signals become weaker due to the impact of meteor showers. This impact appears 60 days before the day O with the most meteors. The impact is strongest a few days before and after the day O with the most meteors. It begins to disappear 80 days after the day O with the most meteors, as shown in Figure 1C.</p>
<p>4. The Impact of Constellations on Radio Waves</p>
<p>The impact of meteors and meteor showers on radio waves has been described above, so what is the relationship between ordinary constellations and radio waves?</p>
<p>The fact that constellations can affect radio wave communication was only discovered last year by Mr. Jansky, an engineer at Bell Telephone Company.</p>
<p>One day, while he was experimenting with a very long antenna and a short wave of 1.46 meters, he heard a lot of noise. In order to study the source of this noise, he changed the direction of the antenna in various ways, and as a result, he knew that the noise was the strongest when the antenna was facing a certain direction. The direction of this strongest noise was changing every day, and gradually became weaker and then stronger again. After a full year, in other words, on the day exactly one year after the discovery of this noise, the direction and strength of the noise were the same as when it was discovered a year ago (the change in direction during the year is shown in Figure 2). Therefore, he presumed that this cause was outside the Earth, and studied the direction with the greatest impact. As a result, astronomy knew that this direction was exactly the center of the Milky Way. Combining the above facts, he believed that for various reasons, the Milky Way could broadcast a kind of radio wave back to Earth: this is the source of the noise in his experiment.</p>
<p>In the current wireless academic community, although it is not yet possible to say definitively whether the Milky Way can emit radio waves to the Earth, it cannot be denied that it can have a great impact on radio waves. (End)</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is not difficult. What is difficult is to prevent illness and maintain a cheerful spirit during the quitting period. However, to achieve this expectation, one must first seek a tonic that can treat various diseases at the same time to be effective. Based on our clinical experience, Stanal's "Reproductive Essence" is the most effective. "Reproductive Essence" can eliminate nicotine addiction early, break the smoking habit early, and quickly restore health. It is also the ideal remedy that smokers dream of.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Baohua quit smoking because he was physically weak and unable to support himself. He tried medication without success, so he smoked to invigorate himself. He smoked for many years and tried to quit several times, but all failed due to illness and pain. Now, because the prohibition is strict and future consequences are worrying, he came to me for diagnosis and treatment. I immediately instructed him to take "Reproductive Essence" during the quitting period. The symptoms of weakness were completely treated. There was no pain during the quitting period, and the smoking habit was broken earlier than expected, which Mr. Liang found very surprising.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Youth Illness Should Be Treated Quickly <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and kidney atrophy are all caused by weakened reproductive glands. Young people suffer from it the most, so doctors collectively call it youth illness. If you suffer from it and do not treat it early, it will not only gradually weaken your ability and lose interest in life, but also gradually weaken your body and nerves, losing your health and shortening your life.</p>
<p>The treatment for nocturnal emission is to first consolidate the essence. You should take Hemeito's Essence-Consolidating Pills. If you also take Reproductive Essence to nourish the deficiency, it will be the most important way to treat the root cause.</p>
<p>For premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy, in addition to referring patients to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for radio wave therapy, I mainly use Stanal's "Reproductive Essence" for medication. Because its effect of reversing aging and restoring youth is truly great, it can completely cure premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Leukorrhea in Women and Its Most Convenient Treatment Method <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Human organs have the wonder of cooperating with each other for the whole body. If one part is sick, it will affect the whole. For example, leukorrhea in women not only makes the body lose its beauty and happiness, but those who suffer from it often have no hope of having children. This is because the pus secreted in the vagina contains strong properties that kill sperm when they encounter it. To seek children is like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gong is a beautiful and intelligent young woman. After marriage, she suffered from leukorrhea. Her beauty was lost, and her health was also lost. She was weak and often sick, and had no children. The relationship between husband and wife was greatly affected. Her husband was moved to take a concubine to seek children. Mrs. Gong then asked her aunt and sister-in-law to accompany her to me for treatment. I instructed her to purchase Therapeutic Belt Spirit and treat herself at home according to the law, and also take Female Reproductive Essence internally. She recovered in more than two months. Her body gradually returned to normal, and her beauty was still as it was back then. Therefore, her husband's proposal to take a concubine disappeared without being attacked. The two medicines, used internally and externally, protect the happiness of the family. Is it trivial?</p>

<p>I have now escaped the dangerous situation. Looking back on the past, I was suffering from hundreds of diseases, as if I were in a tiger's den. However, I have to attribute my success today to Dr. Zhan Nianceng and "Reproductive Essence."</p>
<p>Three months ago, I was as weak as a dying body waiting for orders. Today, I am as strong as a dragon and a tiger. It is no exaggeration to say that "Reproductive Essence" is my reborn parent. At that time, I was weak and sick, with hundreds of deficiencies. The most painful thing was that my back ached, my limbs were tired, my heart was weak, I was often frightened, and cold sweats covered my body, as if I was about to collapse. Although I had consulted doctors and taken medicine, I did not see any reduction, let alone recovery. Fortunately, I am a reader of this publication, so I learned that Dr. Zhan Nianceng is an expert in treating weakness and sexual diseases. Dr. Zhan is kind and approachable, and his examination is meticulous. He introduced famous medicines to treat my long-term illness. I should sincerely worship and thank him for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Patient Yan Zhongpo suffered from a weak stomach. His food intake was sharply reduced, and his digestion was exceptionally weak, so he could not fully absorb the nutrients needed by his body. As a result, his body was weak and he suffered from many diseases. He took various stomach medicines repeatedly, which were effective for a while, but failed to fundamentally solve the problem. This spring, because of stomach pain and acid reflux, he was introduced by Mr. Li Yongquan to me for diagnosis and treatment. In addition to prescribing "Stomach Pain Spirit" to treat his stomach disease, because his stomach was weak and unbearable, I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Tonic" from Huamei Pharmacy. After taking it, he immediately felt that his digestion was strong and his appetite was strong. After taking several boxes in a row, his stomach was stronger than anyone else, which he had never had since he was born.</p>

<p>— Contribution from Sheng Xianqiong</p>
<p>I suffered from severe hemoptysis, which caused my face to be sallow and my figure to be thin. Although the hemoptysis was cured by various methods, I suffered from anemia due to excessive blood loss. I could not recover for a while. I had tried more than a dozen kinds of blood tonics, but none of them satisfied me. I was still as thin as before. This summer, I suffered from nocturnal emission and was introduced by a friend to Dr. Zhan Nianceng, a specialist in sexual diseases. I was cured of my nocturnal emission with Hemeito's Essence-Consolidating Pills. At that time, Dr. Zhan introduced me to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, saying that it had special effects on anemia and weakness. I followed his instructions and took it. I saw improvement after taking it for several days. I continued to take five boxes with determination. Now I am full of energy and spirit. The symptoms of weakness have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Although nocturnal emission has the distinction between having dreams and not having dreams, its principle is the same, so the treatment method is also the same.</p>
<p>Patient Ding Ziqing was physically weak. Three years ago, he suffered from nocturnal emission. At first, he had nocturnal emission with dreams. After a few months, even without dreams, he would emit by himself in a trance. By last autumn, the condition was even worse. Not only did the number of nocturnal emissions increase to more than ten times a month, but also sperm leakage occurred when urinating during the day. Since suffering from this, he has repeatedly taken various medicines, but the effect is negligible. This spring, his close friend Mr. Zhu Xielin introduced him to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase Hemeito's Essence-Consolidating Pills from Sino-British Pharmacy to consolidate his essence pass, and also instructed him to take Reproductive Essence to nourish his deficiency. In just two months, the disease has been completely treated.</p>

<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>There are four fundamental differences between women's physiology and that of men: menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. Furthermore, women's constitutions are generally weaker than men's, and their liver qi is easily stagnant, leading to a tendency for worry and sorrow. Therefore, even when suffering from the same general weakness ailments, the prescriptions and medications used will differ from those used for men.</p>
<p>A patient, Madam Shang, is 27 years old. She has always been physically frail and, after marriage, has been prone to worry and illness, resulting in her inability to conceive. She often experiences abdominal pain during menstruation. This spring, Mr. Shang accompanied her to my clinic for treatment. Upon examination, I found that Madam Shang's uterus and ovaries were both weakened and failing. I immediately instructed her to purchase and take "Female" Reproductive Essence from a Chinese-Western pharmacy for a period of only seven or eight weeks. She immediately felt her ailments disappear and became stronger than ever.</p>

<p>Headache That Won't Heal</p>
<p>Mr. Qinsheng asks: I have suffered from headaches for a long time. Taking headache medicine has been ineffective. Now I also suffer from severe insomnia. Please prescribe a treatment. (Answer) This is caused by brain weakness. You should take Reproductive Essence to treat it.</p>
<p>Semen Ejaculating on Its Own</p>
<p>Zhu Mengjin asks: Yesterday, as my examination was about to end, I suddenly felt my seminal duct open and semen ejaculate on its own. I am very anxious. Please prescribe a treatment. (Answer) Quickly take Himrod's Semen-Consolidating Pills as essential. You should also take Reproductive Essence regularly to nourish yourself.</p>
<p>Seeking Supplementation After Semen Loss</p>
<p>Hu Tongqi asks: I previously suffered from spermatorrhea. Following your instructions, I was cured with Himrod's Semen-Consolidating Pills. Now, please prescribe a method for nourishing the brain. (Answer) You can take "Reproductive Essence to Nourish the Brain." Your dizziness will naturally heal.</p>
<p>Stomach and Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Zhan asks: My wife has suffered from leukorrhea for many years. She has acid reflux and stomach pain. She also has lower abdominal pain during menstruation. Please prescribe a treatment for all of these conditions. (Answer) Take Female Reproductive Essence and Stomach Pain Relief internally. Use Leukorrhea Relief externally. This should cure the root cause.</p>

<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Neurasthenia, Kidney Deficiency, Lower Back Pain</p>
<p>Patient: Min Yuandi, from Changxing, age 36, in business. (Chief complaint) – Thin and weak body, lower back pain. (Medical history) – Mr. Min was not born with a strong constitution, so his body is frail. He is often ill and has taken medicine almost every day. However, his weakness persists. Last year, due to imbalance after an illness, he suffered from dizziness, lower back and leg weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, and a fear of activity and fatigue. He consulted doctors for treatment, but the effects were not significant. This spring, he switched to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment. (Present symptoms) – Neurasthenia, insomnia, forgetfulness, imbalance after illness. (Treatment) – I observed that Mr. Min had severe neurasthenia. I immediately prescribed the targeted medication, Stanolind's "Reproductive Essence." After taking it, the effects were very significant. He was able to sleep peacefully at night, and his mind was clear and healthy. After taking several boxes in a row, he immediately felt strength in his lower back, abundant qi and blood, developed muscles, and increased weight. Even when working for extended periods, he did not feel tired. His state of health was unprecedented in his life.</p>
<p>The Suffering of a Patient with Kidney Atrophy</p>
<p>Patient: Wang Hengyu, from Chongming, age 29, in business. (Chief complaint) – Kidney atrophy, lower back pain, dizziness, exhausted essence. (Medical history) – Before puberty, Mr. Wang was poisoned by obscene books and mistakenly committed masturbation. Over time, it became a habit that was difficult to quit. The harm of wasting away in a dark room was particularly severe. As a result, he developed incomplete development, brain weakness, insomnia, kidney deficiency, and lower back pain. He repeatedly took tonics, but nothing could reverse the damage. In the autumn of his 21st year, he also discovered spermatorrhea, occurring several times a month. His physical strength was exhausted. He took more than ten different kinds of kidney-tonifying and essence-preserving pills, but they were still not very effective. He married at the age of 24 but suffered from kidney atrophy, failing his duties as a husband. His feelings with his partner grew distant. This spring, due to a sharp increase in the frequency of spermatorrhea and unbearable insomnia, he began seeking treatment at my clinic. (Present symptoms) – Incomplete development, insomnia, thinness, neurasthenia. (Treatment) – Upon my recommendation, he purchased and took Himrod's Semen-Consolidating Pills from Jicheng Pharmacy to strengthen his seminal gate. The spermatorrhea stopped. I also instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to treat his kidney atrophy and heal his deficiencies. Before he finished half a dozen, he immediately felt his marrow full of essence, his natural functions normal, and his body strong and healthy. He was like a different person.</p>

<p>(1) Quitting Smoking Early Cures Premature Ejaculation Too</p>
<p>Patient: Shao Rujun, age 41, from Wuxian, businessman. In his youth, he was induced by bad friends to develop the bad habit of masturbation. Excessive indulgence depleted his essence, weakened his body, and made him susceptible to illness. It was not until the age of 22 that he unconsciously quit due to marriage. He felt that he suffered from severe premature ejaculation, which greatly displeased his partner. He took various medicines, but none provided treatment. Later, he also suffered from kidney atrophy, extinguishing his vitality and eliminating his hope for offspring. He had neurasthenia and suffered from various diseases. He was advised to smoke opium to alleviate his suffering. After smoking a few times, he seemed to feel mentally stimulated and somewhat satisfied. Over time, he became addicted to smoking, and his nerves became paralyzed. However, due to the various inconveniences of smoking, he tried to quit several times, but his efforts failed due to repeated illnesses. Recently, due to the government's determination to eliminate drugs, it was difficult to continue smoking. Therefore, he was introduced by Mr. Fang Songyun to seek treatment for his venereal disease at my clinic. I informed him of methods for maintaining health, applied scientific electrotherapy, and instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. At the same time, I ordered him to quit smoking. Within the specified period, his ailments disappeared, and he quit smoking early, as if celebrating a new life.</p>
<p>(2) Another Case of Spermatorrhea Treatment</p>
<p>Patient: Zhang Xiangsun, age 19, local, student. Mr. Zhang engaged in youthful bad habits early on, causing depletion of his essence and preventing his body from developing well. His essence was exhausted, and his brain was weakened. His academic performance declined sharply. His thinking ability was weak, and his memory was greatly reduced. In addition, he suffered from dizziness and brain swelling during the day and insomnia with excessive dreams at night. Fearing the harmful effects, he began to quit on his own. However, his pubertal glands had become particularly weak, leading to spermatorrhea. Sometimes it occurred with dreams, sometimes without. After ejaculation, he felt remorseful and physically exhausted. He purchased kidney-tonifying medicines but was unable to cure the root cause, which he found very distressing. This spring, due to an increase in the frequency of spermatorrhea, which was difficult to bear, he began searching for a treatment for venereal disease. He was introduced by a classmate to seek treatment at my clinic. In addition to using the latest scientific surgical method, electrotherapy, to transmit to his nerve center, I also prescribed a large amount of Himrod's Semen-Consolidating Pills and Reproductive Essence for a period of two months. The spermatorrhea was completely eradicated, and his body also became stronger.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Education Bureau Cares About the Improvement of Drama <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>Drama is a form of social education, and its impact on the public is significant. Good drama can leave a good impression on the audience, while bad drama can harm society. However, all dramas in our country are either immature (new ones), or the old ones not only fail to meet the goals of social education but also carry a strong feudal color or hinder public morals. Recently, the Municipal Education Bureau has been determined to improve various dramas. Previously, seeing the influence of comedic skits deeply rooted in the people, and in order to use them as a powerful tool for promoting social education, the bureau specially assigned members of the Drama and Record Review Committee to lead the city's stand-up comedians and organize the Shanghai Stand-up Comedy Research Association. This will not only enhance the social status of stand-up comedians but also enable all performers to earnestly improve their lyrics in order to achieve a subtle and transformative effect. The results have been very good. Stand-up comedies that used to sing about the incompetence of crying kings are now able to spread social education. Recently, the association's seventh regular meeting decided on six concrete measures to improve stand-up comedy. In the passive aspect, there are four prohibitions: (1) No indecent words or performances are allowed, (2) No abusive sentences are allowed, (3) No mourning tunes are allowed, (4) No lyrics and performances that have been banned by the authorities are allowed. In the active aspect, there are two requirements: (1) All members, whether performing in theaters or broadcasting on the radio, must insert a section of lyrics that is beneficial to society and contains educational meaning into each performance, (2) All members must copy the lyrics completely and submit them to the Education Bureau for review. This phenomenon is very gratifying.</p>
<p>Recently, the Education Bureau, considering that the "bengbeng" operas being performed by Bai Yushuang and others at the Empire Theater and the North China Opera Theater were filled with obscene singing and gestures, specially sent reviewers to the theaters to review them and gave them separate bans and improvements. And a few days ago, they gathered all the actors and talked to them at the Civic Education Hall, explaining the social education mission undertaken by the drama, and pointed out the points that should be improved: (1) In terms of tone, there should be no obscene puns, (2) In terms of sound, there should be no decadent music, (3) The action should not be dirty, (4) Horror plots are prohibited, (5) Actors should not have actions that tempt the audience, (6) The insertion of stage scenes should not be exaggerated too much. These points should not only be improved in "bengbeng" opera, but also in other dramas.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau's recent implementation of drama improvement to assist the promotion of social education is commendable. Especially this time, the handling of "bengbeng" opera does not take the means of strict prohibition, but sends personnel to review it in order to determine the improvement, which is quite able to take care of the livelihood of the actors. However, we still have some opinions on the improvement of old dramas in our country. It is true that drama is a kind of social education. But why can bad dramas be produced in our society? And why do the general public like to watch these kinds of bad dramas? We hope that the education authorities in our country can also pay close attention to these two questions.</p>

<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>"The countryside is really dead. After dark, you can't take a step except to sleep!" It was indeed a youth who was obsessed with city life, and being back in his hometown for only half a month made him feel depressed.</p>
<p>"Why don't you go to the teahouse in town?" the young aunt said faintly, glancing at her mother.</p>
<p>"I don't like going to that kind of dirty and vulgar place!" He yawned, seeming a little tired.</p>
<p>"Go to sleep!" The third aunt, who was making shoe soles for the child, also opened her mouth.</p>
<p>There were seven of us together, but besides the third aunt making shoes, the young aunt knitting a woolen sweater, and me reading a novel, there were four other people sitting idly in their corners, casting their eyes on the dim flames, but the flames did not understand, only being fanned by the wind blowing in from the window, flickering. The lamp flowers, one by one, were stacked up like embroidered hydrangea balls.</p>
<p>The village dog was barking frantically, and the old hen in the chicken coop was awakened from her sweet dreams, clucking loudly. Xiong and Ying had stopped talking, and were all silent. I also put down the book I was reading and listened attentively...</p>
<p>"Dong dong! Dang... dong dong! Dang!" The sound of someone beating a leather drum and small gong gradually approached from afar and finally reached the front of our house. In the past, we often heard this sound at dusk, but because everyone was playing mahjong or engaged in other exciting games, no one would pay attention to it, but today, every beat seemed to strike in the hearts of each of us; the sound was particularly harsh.</p>
<p>"It's the news singer. Let's call him in to sing the news!" Xiong seemed to have discovered something and jumped up happily.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Goddess <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<p>An old peasant who had escaped from the war zone sat like a wooden chicken at the foot of Buzhou Mountain, his face showing infinite resentment. He had used up his sweat and blood to irrigate the rice in his fields, which was now more than a foot high, but a declaration of war trampled on his fields, destroyed his houses, and even caused his wife and children to be scattered. He wondered when the water of the Yellow River would clear and when the world could be peaceful? (9)</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>The news singer was a blind man in his forties and a little girl of twelve or thirteen. The blind man held a broken huqin in his right hand, but a five- or six-foot-long dry tobacco pipe in his left. The little girl also held the copper bowl of the dry tobacco pipe in one hand and a drumstick in the other. Around her neck hung a small leather drum and a small gong, hanging straight in front of her chest. It seemed that they were father and daughter. He sat down in the hall, loaded a pipe with tobacco and smoked it, waiting for our words, but the little girl searched everyone's faces with her two not very clever eyes, as if to discover some miracle.</p>
<p>The blind man smoked for a while, knocked the head of the pipe twice on the square brick, knocked off the ash, then picked up the broken skin huqin, tightened the strings, and corrected the sound.</p>
<p>As he pulled and sang, we were all quiet, listening with our heads tilted. Everyone stared at the blind man's face, but there was not a trace of expression on his face; his face was waxen yellow, his nose was flat, only two thin lips were mechanically moving, and a mouthful of scorched yellow and defective teeth often showed from that crack.</p>
<p>The blind man finished singing the news, collected the money, and when he was leaving, he said "Thank you!" to us. In the distance, the second watch had been lightly struck! (The End)</p>

<p>(I love to watch the eagle soaring in the sky, and I love to listen to his clear singing even more! Young friends, don't forget: what he tells us!)</p>
<p>Not forgotten, not forgotten at all. Not forgotten the clear singing of the great eagle, nor forgotten the singing of the friend who soared like an eagle. Their clear and crisp singing, like the bugle call that inspires everyone's courage, sings the sharp and majestic melody non-stop, without end, exciting me, leaping into the hearts of every young person.</p>
<p>It was an evening. In that distant south, we, a group of young children, had a very simple gathering. We were sighing, our eyebrows knotted in silence, not saying a word. The sun stubbornly poked its head out from the foot of the western mountains, with a little pity, its face flushed, and looked angrily. Darkness, revealing a ferocious smile, opened a large black curtain, covering the whole earth in a gray and terrifying world. The four of us leaned against a cliff, two weeping, one sighing, and one shouting angrily and rudely. To the end, there was only a desert left, the desert shut its mouth; the young man also shut his mouth, lowered his head, and supported his chin with his strong hand, not saying a word.

<p>Tale of Laughter and Tears: Breaking Off Ties</p>
<p>Fengxi, oh. (Sing) Only in your telepathic heart. That unyielding true love. (Monologue) Fengxi thought, but had no words to answer. After half a day, she only said one sentence. (Female dialogue) Master. You think I'm just a broken flower and faded willow. (Male dialogue) Oh, Fengxi. Is it that you are determined not to unite with me? Well, I will not force you. I only ask you. (Sing) May flowers always be beautiful. May the moon always be bright. Live happily and freely in this life. Don't let things disappoint your beautiful youth. Alas, Shachili's heart is unpredictable. It's hard to guarantee that he won't change his mind in the future. How will you survive falling into the tiger's mouth? (Dialogue) Fengxi, oh Fengxi. (Sing) I still hope you. Think carefully, consider carefully. As the saying goes. Wealth and glory are like floating clouds. (Female dialogue) It's not that I'm greedy for wealth. You can rest assured of that. (Male dialogue) I think you have already made up your mind. Why are you here again today? (Female sing) Master Fan. Don't be angry. I will never forget your great kindness. Alas, only half of my body remains. I think my name is not on the marriage register. Wasted your two thousand yuan. Today. I offer you a check to show my gratitude. (Monologue) When Fan Jashu heard that she was returning the money, he took the check in his hand. He looked at it. Ah, four thousand silver dollars. Doubling it to return to me. He was so angry that he flew into a rage. But he laughed instead. That laugh. Was more painful than anger. (Male dialogue) Haha, haha. Thank you for your generous gift. I am infinitely grateful. I guess I've made a fortune. (Sing) I was just a poor scholar. I've never seen a check for four thousand silver. (Dialogue) Check, oh check. (Sing) I think you are infinitely powerful. The so-called power of money is known to the world. For you. They drive out their own children. They sell inferior goods. Even if there is affection between father and son. It is reduced by two or three points for you. For you. They divide the inheritance. They go to court. Even if there is affection between brothers. It is reduced by two or three points for you. For you. They solicit favors. They talk about friendship. Even if there is affection between friends. It is reduced by two or three points for you. Today. With your one piece of paper, you sever old feelings. Oaths and promises are broken in an instant. I am. Just like a market merchant. (Dialogue) Check, oh check. Don't say that the world admires you. I will. Break you into pieces and execute you. See how many springs you will run rampant.</p>

<p>Opening "Yu Bei Ting, Meng Yuehua Shelters from the Rain"</p>
<p>Yuehua is. Walking hurriedly in the setting sun. Who knows. Suddenly a strong wind rises in the sky. In an instant. Xiao Xiao blew gradually fierce. Later. Yellow dust filled the sky and rolled for a long time. Seeing that. The children broke the kite string. Disappeared without a trace in a moment. Hearing that. The trees beside the road rustled. The wind is. Entering the bamboo and passing through the forest is even more fierce. Blowing that. Reversing boats rushed to shore. Blowing that, downwind hanging alone. Blowing that. Long strips of willow leaves sleep and rise. Blowing that. Powerless Yang flower west to east. Moreover. Black clouds momentarily covered the sky. The scenery is similar to dusk. Suddenly heard. A thunderbolt broke my heart. But originally. Thunder could not help but rumble. Lightning is. Ten thousand golden snakes danced in the sky. Like a rainbow hanging in the sky. Clearly. The Rain Master and Wind God came to meet. So taught. The Thunder God and the Electric Mother to be the vanguard. This time. There are few people in the plain. Meng Yuehua. It's hard to stop the little deer from bumping into my heart. Moreover. The cool breeze made my clothes feel cold. Suddenly looking up, the drizzle was wet. But only see. Pedestrians go home to avoid the rain. Yuehua is. Several degrees of thought have been exhausted. The body is as soft as cotton and powerless. How can people not complain about the sky? However. Coincidence has been said since ancient times. That Yuehua sheltered from the rain towards the pavilion. Encountered a stranger in the same way.</p>

<h3 id="e215">The Grand Occasion of "Beware of Pity" in Paris <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The detective masterpiece "Beware of Pity," which shocked the world and is known to everyone, young and old, was released at the Paris Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre yesterday. The box office success is unprecedented, which shows the greatness of the film. Those who have seen it should see it again, and those who have not seen it should not miss this last chance.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Play Within a Play in "Flower of Spring" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Interesting Facts on the Set</p>
<p>"In 'Flower of Spring,' there are several sketching shots in the photography. Gao Zhanfei is hired by a film company as a temporary actor in the play to replace a male lead in a diving scene because his face is similar to that of the male lead. At the same time, because of his financial problems, he had no choice but to take the dangerous dive that others were unwilling to try.</p>
<p>Here, Wu Cun, the director of 'Flower of Spring,' uses these shots to satirize the current noble and corrupt film practitioners. When the heroine, Zhu Qiuhen, comes out of the dressing room, singing a foreign film song, she walks to Gao Zhanfei, greets him, and gives him candy. At this time, the old Gao, who was hired as a temporary actor, is very surprised by the heroine's kind gesture. Zhu Qiuhen suddenly feels that the button on her clothes is not buttoned properly and coquettishly asks Gao Zhanfei to button it for her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a real male lead runs out of the production department, walks up to Zhu, and shouts, "Hey! Miss Zhu, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen is greatly surprised to see the male lead: "Ah! Aren't you here? Who are you?"</p>
<p>Male lead: "He is a temporary actor and will replace me in the diving scene."</p>
<p>It turned out that Zhu Qiuhen mistook Gao Zhanfei for her beloved male star, resulting in such a joke.</p>

The first public performance was originally planned to be Moliere's "The Hypocrite" or Messfield's "The Tragedy of the Fair Penitent". After several discussions, it was decided to change Roman Rolland's "The Game of Love and Death" and Moliere's "The Imaginary Invalid" into the scripts for the first and second public performances.</p>

<p>The promotion of "Hero of the Times", "The evil spirit shouts for Gary Cooper." In addition to being extremely busy, Gong Zhifang's wife, Miss Shen Yiyun, also practiced the husband-sings-wife-follows, as evidenced by Miss "Yiyun's" promotional manuscript for "Hero of the Times" in yesterday's Film Times.</p>
<p>The Times reported: "The humble person says! Tianyi is a great base for cultivating talents. Hu Die, Shen Xiling, and Lu Xiaoluo, which one of them did not come from our Tianyi?"</p>
<p>Nine-tenths of "Tianlun" will be shown at "Great Light" (nine-tenths, because there are still problems with Jin Cheng), but the date is two days</p>
<p>After "Boat Girl," "Hero of the Times" will be shown, and the date will be next Thursday. The long-rumored "Peach Blossom Dream" will have to be postponed again.</p>
<p>The promotional manuscript for "Peach Blossom Dream," directed by Dan Duyu, who is known for his sensuality, says: "Dan Duyu, who has progressive ideas, once said that the film is in a leading position, so it should not cater to the general low-level audience, and should do its best in art..."</p>
