<p>時評</p>
<h3>不景氣果由於通貨緊縮乎</h3>
<p>— 冷觀</p>
<p>我國近來農村彫敝。各業蕭條。商市因存貨堆積而周轉不靈。工廠因製品滯銷而减少工作。甚至倒閉淸理時有所聞。於是世之論者。輒謂「此不景氣之釀成也。由於世界銀市提高。銀市高則現銀紛紛外溢。現銀外溢則通貨緊縮。通貨緊縮則物價步跌。以致百業衰落。氣象慘淡。幾有不可終日之勢。」愚對此說。頗不謂然。物價步落。果由銀市提高所致乎。抑另有複雜原因乎。通貸果已緊縮（此指狹義的通貨）否乎。與其謂爲通貨緊縮。毌寗認爲信用收縮。信用收縮以致釀成不景氣乎。抑因不景氣而信用不得不收縮乎。孰者爲因。孰者爲果。探厥本原。則亦頗費思索。世人有倒果爲因。或僅見其偏而未見其全者。此所以議論紛耘。迄未有根本解决之道也。以管見所及。近年物價步跌。原因甚多。大抵如左列各項。</p>
<p>（一）出口貨因海外需要减少而滯銷。</p>
<p>（二）向銷東北四省之機製國貨（如棉紗麵粉等。）今均銷路减少。</p>
<p>（三）農產品因受世界市况之牽制其價格一落千丈。</p>
<p>（四）各國貨幣脫離金本位。對華匯價驟落。以致舶來貨品較廉。競爭益烈。</p>
<p>（五）內地居民受匪盜侵擾。又爲苛捐雜稅所困。加以災祲薦臻。生計艱窘。</p>
<p>購買力愈覺薄弱。</p>
<p>（六）土貨輸出旣减。內地金融枯竭。一般貨品銷路愈滯。</p>
<p>由上述者觀之。物價步跌。不盡由於銀市提高。且在去年八月以前。匯價雖有顯著之變遷。銀市却無特殊之變化。論者如不加詳察。一味歸咎於銀市。似亦未免僅見其偏而未見其全。</p>
<p>自九一八以後。通貨是否緊縮。亦應詳加研究。茲就最近三年間上海各銀行發鈔數列表此較如左。</p>
<p>千元</p>
<p>二十年七月　三一〇，五二〇</p>
<p>二十一年一月　二六二，四一〇</p>
<p>七月　二二五，一七〇</p>
<p>二十二年一月　二九九，一三一</p>
<p>七月　二七八，一三七</p>
<p>二十三年一月　三四一，四五九</p>
<p>七月　三四九，五八九</p>
<p>二十四年一月　四〇四，四一六</p>
<p>由上表觀之。上海各行發鈔總額。在二十一年及二十二上半年。雖較减少。至最近一年半間。匪特未减。反較九一八以前擴大。雖此外尙有各省銀行及各地商號所發票券。無從統計。硬幣流通究有若干。亦無確數可査。然通貨並未較前緊縮。可斷言也。自去冬以來。各地金融阻滯。海上銀錢業對於各業不肯放欵。收縮信用。確爲事實。蓋私設金融機關。注意自衛。以對存戶及持鈔人負責爲辭。不肯任意放欵。而在各業亟待救濟者。則以金融機關。不論公私。有調劑市面之責。雙方固各有理由。然而際此非常時期。雖有小額放欵。杯水車薪。究不足爲根本之救濟。要之。先有不景氣而後收縮信用。信用愈收縮則不景氣愈深刻。兩者實互爲因果。故欲圖補救。非有治本之道不可。願籌救濟市面者注意及此。</p>

<h3>德國宣言整軍經武　引起全歐大震驚　公然撕毀和約軍事條欵　恢復強迫軍役謂在自衛　有關係國將聯合提抗議</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國廢止凡爾塞和約軍事條欵、恢復强迫軍役制、成立十二軍卽三十六師、業已成爲事實、希特勒元首兼總理原在巴維耶地方休憇、昨日突然返京、當晚卽會晤各閣員、本日午刻復舉行內閣會議、當决定頒布强制軍役法、隨由宣傳部長戈培爾向報界發表公報、並由外部通知英法意三國大使、曁凡爾賽和約其他各簽字國代表、希特勒總理嗣又發表吿民衆書、謂德國對於和約裁軍條欵曾嚴格執行、幷撤廢各種軍器、此在各戰勝國仍在積極擴充軍備中、因此德國現有兵力絕不足以保障安全、其言有曰、「德國政府欲在精神實質上保有必要之兵力、藉以維持德國和平、卽所以維持歐洲和平、此外別無他求」、嗣又提及蘇聯兵力及法國恢復兩年兵役制各事、謂「德國政府採取必要措置以保障安全、實屬刻不容緩、茲特向民衆及全世界再度鄭重宣言、德國政府所採取之措置、僅以保障德國榮譽與自由所必需者爲度、此次重整軍備、僅視爲維持和平之防禦工具、决不用以攻擊他國」云云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國决定立刻召集徵兵五十餘萬之後、全歐今日已達沸點、元首希特勒對於凡爾賽和約己棄如敝屣、此項消息不轉瞬間、卽傳至全球各國首都、國際觀察者竟謂目前情形、已與歐戰以前之巴爾幹半島局勢不相上下、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）外長賴伐爾今晨會晤英國駐法代辦坎貝爾、談話内容雖完全保守秘密、然消息靈通方面、以爲英法意政府對於德國廢止凡爾賽和約軍事條欵一事、不能熟視無覩、因此或將聯合凡爾賽條約簽字國、向德國提出抗議、亦未可知、（十七日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>希特勒宣言要旨</h3>
<p>（柏林）德元首希特勒昨日發表引起國際界擾攘之驚人宣言、謂凡爾賽條約其他簽約國之不能履約、及德國與其他軍縮建議之遭拒絕、使德政府不能不决議重施全國强迫軍役制、並組織和平軍十二軍團卽三十六師團、宣言書中曾特殊着重法政府决議將軍役期限由一年增至二年、並增募傭兵、及蘇俄大增軍額二事、繼言及德國因英法等國不能盡其本分、贊助德國所提出解决歐洲困難之建議、故特脫離國聯、宣言書首由宣傳部長戈培爾在宣傳部忽遽召集之外報代表會前宣讀、繼在運動宮國社黨大集會前宣讀、大旨謂德國已履行凡爾賽條約下之義務、而其他簽字國則均未履行之、且有若干國反增加其軍備、德國處武裝雄原之各國中、無以自衛、德國與其他軍縮建議之悉遭拒絕、使人推料凡爾賽條約其他簽約國不復有履行約中軍縮條欵之傾嚮、故德政府覺不得不自負責任、取必要之計畫、以擔保德國之無以自衛卽此終止、德國曾聲明在薩爾問題解决後不再對法有土地的要求、並提出互不侵犯公約之建議、但德國鑒於蘇俄陸軍已增至九十六萬人、而法國亦决議增募傭兵、並展長軍役期限、故覺不能不取使德國安全之必要計畫、或將此項計畫秘不使世界知之、今特應英閣員包爾溫之請、聲明德國之意志、特發表此宣言、且使世人得知維持德國榮譽與安全之責、已復委諸德國自己之力量矣、宣言書末段謂爲銷除外界以爲德國人民現力圖佔歐洲軍事上卓越地位之疑慮起見、德政府特保證德國之行動、决不踰越保持德國榮譽與安全之範圍、决不使其軍備激起敵對之攻擊、而唯圖衛國、藉以維持和平而已云、</p>
<p>戈培爾宣讀宣言書前、聲明元首希特勒在巴伐利亞養病痊愈後返至柏林、卽召集內閣會議、通過重置軍備之法律、繼言及歐洲之大戰德國實被迫而出此、後又揚其聲浪、臚舉德國遵從凡爾賽和約所銷燬之軍火、該宣言書在運動宮宣讀之際、歡呼之聲震耳欲聾、戈氏末日、大戰中死者今因此而獲榮譽矣、生者亦獲未來安全之保障矣、吾人以此榮譽謹鞠躬於祖國偉大之前、領袖萬歲、於是在塲諸人亦齊呼領袖萬歲以應之、繼唱國歌黨歌、大會領袖旋請戈氏代向希特勒表示國社黨全體之威忱與忠誠、戒培爾語路透訪員、謂强迫軍役計畫將施於防空全部、卽陸海空軍是、惟謂渠對於增加海軍實力一節、毫無所知、但照目下之計畫、海軍兵士之可徵募陸軍空與軍相同、又稱、重整軍備法律規定警察亦併入陸軍之中云、</p>
<p>昨日德內閣會議中宣讀宣言後、諸閣員皆起立三呼希特勒萬歲、並對希特勒表示忠誠、國社黨機關報載一社論、謂政府之决議、實有歷史上至大之關係、此爲德國忍辱簽定凡爾賽和約後德國人民所獲最大之榮譽云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>正式通知英法意</h3>

<p>（柏林）德國元首希特勒、本日在民衆熱烈歡呼聲中、檢閱德國國防軍、歐戰名將麥剛森上將、國防部長　隆培將軍·航空部長戈林·海軍上將拉　·國防軍總參謀長德弗　區將軍，均參預閱兵禮、由九十餘歲之德國老將哀貝爾哈特以榮譽十字章親授國防軍、步騎兵及柏林波斯頓駐防軍、均列隊游行、軍容甚盛、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>隆重紀念舊戰士</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國今日在隆重典儀之中、紀念歐戰陣亡將士、同時亦慶祝元首希特勒之重行人民軍役制度、以保持德國安全、各報皆稱希氏此舉、實爲紀念歐戰英雄最商當之方法、紀念典禮在柏林國家戲院舉行、希氏亦親自蒞臨、並由國防部長白隆培演說、今日各報皆稱三月十七日雖爲德國人民新軍十二軍團三十六師之誕辰、惟此項軍隊、並不擬爲侵略他人之用、而爲保持和平、與英法增加軍費、具同等意義、凡爾賽和約之重要部份雖已推翻、然德國之恢復榮譽、不能視爲卽係對於他國之一種挑釁舉動云、某報則謂德國人民之喜悅、並非爲熱心　武、而爲糾正向日之錯誤、至德國此舉、外間將發生何等影響、目下尙未能預料、惟希望英國外相西門、仍能依照原來計畫來德耳、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>德舉國歡欣鼓舞</h3>
<p>（柏林）希持勒宣吿廢止凡爾賽和約軍事條疑、恢復强迫軍役制之後、本日有民衆數萬人羣集總理府前廣塲、高呼希特勒之名、日「元首以陸軍曁軍器還諸吾民、吾民感謝無旣、元首其立於窗前受人歡呼」、希特勒元首當卽面窗而立、由黨代表赫斯、宣傳部長戈培爾侍立其側、是時羣衆熱烈欲狂、擁至窗下、高唱「德意志高於一切」之歌、本日並將舉行儀式、以紀念歐戰陣亡將士、屆時民衆均奉令下半旗誌哀、至紀念儀式終了時、則又升旗至日落爲止、「藉以表示德意志在軍事上恢復主權時、全國人民歡欣鼓舞一、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）政府宣佈廢止凡爾賽條約軍事條欵一事、今晨各報均加以評論、一衝鋒報」謂、「希特勒用意欲在進行國際談話之前、使全世界洞悉確實之局勢、使世人明瞭德國軍備權利平等之事實、而不再有所含糊、今後一切談判、均應在此軍備權利平等之基礎上、着手進行、至於二月三日倫敦宣言書中所指示之談判基礎、則必須完全變更」云、此外國社黨對外事務局長羅森堡、則在「民衆觀察報」著文、謂「希特勒對於維持德國軍備權利平等、以盡力和平一事、實具不可動搖之意志、德國六千六百萬人民均願爲此種志願作後盾」云、總而言之、德國各報均以爲政府此項决定、爲應付歐洲其他各國之軍備起見、實有必要、然外交界人士、則以希特勒、不俟英國外相西門來德、遽作此種决定、殊爲驚異、此外德國政府人士、則又聲稱、謂此種决定、絕無黷武好戰之用意、僅爲保障德國安全而己云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法如聞晴天霹靂　海陸軍力謀擴充</h3>
<p>（倫敦）德國决議施行强迫軍訓、巳以片面行動撕碎凡爾賽和約第五節之規定、此舉不啻爲投入全世界外交界之炸彈、英法意及日內瓦各當局均視之、各有關係强國對於德國此舉商、故猶未發表正式批評、昨日德特勒之宣言、業已引起法國之驚恐、據路透社巴黎電訊、法總理佛蘭亭與外長賴伐爾接得希特勒之宣言後、卽遄返巴黎會商、後據官方宣稱、法國鑒於德國之舉動、已電訓駐外各外交代表立卽與駐在國政府磋商云、至於法政府將採取何種態度、目前尙不能逆料、蓋必須俟與列强會商後、始能有所决議也、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國官塲驚惶莫名、總理佛蘭亭已宣布卽擬召集英意俄法四國會議、衆院海軍委員會主席謂該會卽將趕速完成三萬五千噸超巡洋艦之計劃、然「惟恐不能及時造成耳、」同時一九三五年之海軍計劃、卽添建主力艦一艘及小艦數艘、已忽忽由委員會核准、大槪總理佛蘭亭亦將於星期一二召集特別閣議、討論推進增加法國陸軍之計畫、佛氏昨日自得衆院三次投票信任之後、對於此事將有極大之權力、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德國恢復强迫兵役制度之舉、原非一般人意料所及、法國政府業於本日晚間分電駐外使節、令與駐在國政府相接洽、此間晚報均發行號外、民衆則處以鎭靜、並未發生重大反饗、各通衢亦安堵如恒、此在政府方面當其與英意兩國父換意見之前、亦不致作何行動、緣英法兩國倫敦談話及意法兩國羅馬談話、結果對於任何國欲以片面行動變更和約所規定之軍事條欵者、皆所不許、而意國首相墨索里尼且與法國外長賴伐爾相約定、遇有此種片面行動時、卽當互相諮詢、加之英國西門外相卽將前往柏林、英法意三國對於西歐天空公約·東歐互助公約·多瑙河公約各項計劃、均甚關切、自有互相協商之必要、關於德國恢復强迫兵役制一事、據前陸軍部長貝當上將親信人員宣稱、「吾人早知德國當於本年四月或十月採取此項决定、貝當上將大聲疾呼、主張延長兵役期限、非無故也」云云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英認為具嚴重性　閣議商應付方針</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國人士聞知德國恢復强退兵役制消息、如雷震耳、西門外相原在惠爾斯省作週末休憩、業於晚間趕回外務部、核閱德國外長牛拉脫所發表宣言、首相麥唐納亦已召集內閣軍縮委員會定於明晨開會、俾將英國駐德大使費潑斯所呈送之報告書提出研究、並討論英國所當採取之方針、而西門艾登兩大臣往德聘問之舉、尤所重視、官塲人士以爲希特勒政府所作决定、其性質至爲嚴重、半官式人士、則謂德國政府不問英德兩國談判結果如何、即作此種决定、則英國閣員赴德聘問之舉失其目標、實屬無益、其行期恐將再度延展云、按英國政府曾經迭次宣言、對於任何國片面廢止條約均所反對、此次德國廢止凡爾塞相和約軍事條欵、實即一種片面行動、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨十一時唐寗街相邸舉行臨時閣員會議、討論德國恢復强迫軍役之决議、此次雖非内閣全體會議、但出席者有英相麥唐納·樞密大臣包爾溫·外相西門、掌璽大臣艾登、及外部次官樊錫泰等要人、首相特由別墅驅車到會、足見此次會議之重要、會議歷九十分鐘始散、但彼此終日仍互相接洽、明晨將開內閣全體會議、明日午後外相西門或將出席下院報告一切、其言論當可公佈、衆信閣員今晨所討論者、爲（一）可否有正式之舉動、以答覆希特勒之宣言、（二）軍縮討論之將來動向、（三）因西門遊柏林及艾登遊俄波而起之新問題、同時他國都城亦皆有閣員方面與外交方面之活動、、歐洲政治家欲詳悉新局勢、故此數日內電報往返將極忙碌、英國國聯同志會會長薜西爾子爵對於此事、表示意見、認德國舉動甚可嘆息、其他英國名流亦多表示意見、羅意登女士謂希特勒之舉動、乃英國加入軍備競爭之立卽影響、茂萊敎授以爲未爲恐慌之理由、反對黨領袖藍斯堡口稱、今惟有抱定縮减軍備之决心、與德國談判耳、愛倫勳爵稱、凡爾賽和約解除軍備之條文、必須先行取消、而後始可締成新和約、如與希特勒會商者僅爲西門、則協定當可成立云、軍縮會議主席漢德森對於此事、不願有何批評、據官場消息、英政府現與去意及其他和約簽字國政府　事　洽、（十七如路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國内閣刻正　考　此事、故亦無批評、但德國之宣　、甚引起此　外交界之驚　、蓋以此文二適於外相西門　璽大臣艾登赴柏林之夕而發、表尤可異也、按西門等此次赴德、其主要目的之一、卽爲成立一種協定、以代替凡爾賽和約之第五節、此間對於德國在最近談判時堅决要求平等權利事、亦極注意、蓋德國要求置陸軍三十萬人、而與法方相等也、今德國之舉動、不僅違反凡爾賽和約之規定、且亦大背最近談判之根據、西門外相昨夜八時由南威爾斯返此、現與外部要員討論德國事件、駐德英大使亦有電報吿此事、聞德元首希特勒曾通告駐德英大使、謂法總理佛蘭亭昨日在衆院之演講、指摘德國退出國聯、及德國重置軍備將威脅法國一節、實爲渠實行强迫兵役計畫之原因云、德外長牛賴特亦通吿英大使、謂德國實行强迫軍役後、可有兵力五十萬人、而法國至多可得四十萬人云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>意與英法相諮詢　日內將闡明立場</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意政府今日正式宣稱、政府現正與英法政府接洽德國重置軍備事、稍緩將發表其立塲云、意國官塲現拒絕批評目前大局、但據非正式消息、謂德　之舉動、並非完全出乎意料、此卽爲意　最近竭力主張、德國重返國聯及加</p>

<p>入歐洲團體理由之一云、羅馬人士以爲意相墨索里尼最近發表、意國可以七八百萬戰士置於疆塲云云、蓋亦恐德國將危及意國之安全而發者也、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）關於德國恢復强迫兵役制事、政府發出宣言、謂當與英法兩國政府接洽、可見意國對於意法兩國一月七日所作諾言、（卽互相諮詢）願嚴格履行、按法國素來主張限制軍備、當在組織安全之後、意國業已贊同、爰乃一面擁護安全公約計畫、一面卽整飭軍備、以充實國防、意國對於德國廢止凡爾賽和約之舉、並不視爲突如其來、一般人以爲德國準備恢復强迫兵役制、爲時已久、特利用法國增加兵役年限資爲口實、始乃宣佈實行、此與利用英國白皮書而宣佈設立空軍、其事正同云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於德國廢止凡爾賽條約軍事條欵一事、英法意三國政府自昨日晚間起、業已依照一月七日法意羅馬協定二月三日英法倫敦協定互相諮詢、必可　得結果、綠英法意三國始終均保持聯帶關係也、英國方面以爲二月三日英法所提各項建議、未可予以分離、最近一次內閣會議又復重加聲明、而法國佛蘭亭總理賴伐爾外長昨晚會議結果、亦已分電駐倫敦羅馬兩大使、與兩國政府就近接洽矣、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西門游德或將展緩</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門應否展緩游德、現成問題、惟柏林之游如果展緩、則掌璽大臣艾登之游俄波、亦將受其影響、査凡爾賽和約解除軍備之條文、二月三日英法公文中、早已提及取消、該公文固聲明英法政府願成立保障公約、以代替和約第五節也、英國廣播新外交批評員今晚播音、謂德國逆知英法將請其固定軍備、故决計在談判進行以前、立最高軍備標凖、此乃德國宣言之惟一理由云、十七日　透電）</p>
<h3>日內瓦方面印象</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）此間國際界對於德國廢止凡爾塞和約軍事條欵之舉、發生深刻印象、以爲德國政府此種舉動、顯係先發制人、俾在未來談判中易於制勝云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯接德國將實行强迫軍役計劃之電訊後、甚爲驚訝、國聯人員深恐時局將因以益形糾紛、且恐此舉所引起之敵對及批評、將使歐洲各國間諒解之可能性距離更遠、惟同時並覺德國重置軍備之决議、實爲一種事實上之局勢、不過犧牲其法律上之地位而略加更動者耳、故國聯人員亦不欲過分重視此事、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>奧政府對德同情</h3>
<p>奧政府昨夜諭令各報持論和平、但許其對於德國舉動、作溫和的贊成言動、維也納政界亦爲奧政府歡迎德國之决議、並擬於秋間實施奧國之强迫軍役、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>波蘭政界抱憂慮</h3>
<p>德國之舉動、引起華沙政界之驚慮、認此爲二月三日英法宣言後時局發展之自然結果、謂英法宣言、言及凡爾賽軍事條文之取消、今希特勒乃以已成事實、供獻列强、預料列强將設法承認德國舉動爲合法、反對方面以爲歐洲如聯絡一致、則可以共同哀的美敦書送交柏林、然後佔據德境、以懲戒其視條約爲廢紙之舉動、但歐洲旣不聯絡一致、則凡爾賽和約簽字國或不免遷就解决、德波雖有不侵犯之條約、似可在此後十年中、保護波蘭不受德國之侵略、但此條約能否不爲德國視同另一廢紙、則反對黨不能無疑也、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）德國恢複强迫兵役制消息傳到之後、此間人士甚爲驚駭、咸以爲國社主義政府屢犯重大錯誤、此其一端、德國誅求無厭、其勢洶洶、若此惟凡爾賽和約簽約各國起而聯合制止、乃足以安定世界輿論、英國政府對於此事態度若何、西門外相聘德之期是否無期延展、均爲此間人士所亟欲知之者、至俄國對於各項安全公約之態度、則不擬加以更變云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美不欲干預歐事</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間政界對德國决議重施强迫軍役制、至爲關心、謂德國此舉實背一九二一年之德美條約、蓋該約中亦載有凡爾賽和約第五節限制德國軍備之條欵也、按美國並未簽字於凡爾賽和約、（十七日路透電社）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國國務總理赫爾拒絕表示意見、政府方面顯亦深覺驚懼、惟至少暫時將以此事爲歐洲局部之事、與美國無大關係、可由歐洲各國自行處理、觀察者稱、凡爾賽和約限止德國軍備之條欵、亦具載美德和約、然美國國務院當不致堅决要求德國嚴格遵守、美國海陸軍高級長官謂、德國此舉已重建歐洲之均勢狀態、頗類於一九一四年之情形、某軍事領袖則稱、「德國成立徵兵、實爲當然之結果、此事久已秘密進行、現在不過聲明公開而已、」（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>日當局局隔岸觀火</h3>
<p>（東京）外務省於今日正午尙未接得德國政府宣言廢棄凡爾塞和約軍事條欵之公電、惟外務當局以爲該問題影響歐洲政局甚巨、不願發表一切意見、然日本爲凡爾塞和約之簽字國、故廢棄軍事條欵德國當有正式通吿、屆時外務省將决定態度、目下則靜觀變遷、但當局之見解如下、</p>
<p>（一）德國政府定於昨日宣言、殊出意外、對於英法及蘇俄當然衝動甚大、然數年以來德國對於凡爾塞和約常表不滿、在一般軍縮會議時亦曾主張自主軍縮、並藉此退出國聯故預料其不久當出此舉、且德國公然從事擴充空軍、十二日任命蓋恩格爲航空大臣、事實上卽宣吿廢棄軍事條欵、（一）此事本屬歐洲問題、但有關簽字凡爾塞和約各國、故若簽字國全體必須協議時、日本或亦參加、（一）德國之擴充軍備、英法蘇俄所蒙之影響必相當重大、故今後歐洲之政局必益感困難、（十七日電通電）</p>
<p>各國報紙評論</p>
<h3>德假面具完全揭去</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄報紙載德國之宣言、以德國打破凡爾賽和約爲題、俄國實業化報謂此事重要、不可忽視、德國已揭去其假面具矣、並謂德國以俄國重置軍備力言、要知俄國之所以增原其兵力者、因德國國社黨握權、而希特勒之著作認對俄宣戰、乃其政策之基礎也云、（十七日洛透電）</p>
<h3>集體安全制感威脅</h3>
<p>（倫敦）各報登載德國廢止凡爾賽和約之舉、所用字體、有如廣吿所用者、各報最初評論、顯欲將此事件之嚴重性、略予减輕、星期泰晤士報載稱、「目下所當提出之問題、乃英德兩國閣員柏林談話是否有所裨益、此項談話如須再度展延、雖屬憾事、但此層或不可免、亦屬意中事、然則計擬中之集體安全制度、亦不免感受威脅矣」云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>荷京　此間財政商務界人士對於比國貨幣情形、極為注意、希望比法兩國談話能有好結果、俾比國不至被迫而放棄金本位、則以比國貨幣如果貶値、則荷蘭質幣·瑞士法郞·均將感受威脅故也、一般人深信法國必能以欵項貸與比國、加以援助、並成立協定、用以保障金本位集團各國之貨幣云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日人突然　禁止華人出關　在榆被阻旅客數逾千人　古北口亦發生同樣事件</h3>
<p>原因何在尚未明瞭</p>
<p>北平通信、北平瀋陽間直達通車、於去年七月一日恢復後、迄茲七月有半、關内外旅客因交通便利、故往返者甚衆、就承辦此事之東方旅行社所得佣金而言、除經常費用外、月可贏餘萬元左右、足證往返旅客數目之多寡、該社自改由雙方私人經營後、外間曾一度盛傳將添購車輛、以便擴展業務、頃雖冗寂無聞、但該社經理張永淇僕僕於平楡或楡瀋道上、幾致席不暇暖、一般人對該社未來發展、是有相當估計、認爲平瀋間之鐵路交通、最近將來、或將更臻進步、亦未可知、詎意事竟有大謬不然者、日方於東方旅行社正慘澹經營之際、於前日（十四日）起、突然絕對禁阻華人出關、消息傳來、均覺事出奇突、或非事實、迄至今（十六）日始證實一半、所謂一半、蓋關係方面尙否認之也、茲將今（十六）晨由楡折返北平之一部份旅客所談、藉作佐證、彼等係於前（十四）晚八時十五分、搭乘平瀋通車離平、昨（十五）晨抵楡關、該車上出關旅客、都五百餘人、按照往例、除頭二等乘客外、三等乘客、不論男女老幼、均須至大東公司購所謂「入國證」、方准通行、該證每張最初售洋三角、繼漲至一元、最近漲爲一元三角、出關旅客、爲謀避免途中煩麻、故均樂予購用、</p>
<p>自前（十四日（日起、該大東公司、卽奉命停止發售、「入國證」、卽有人願斥資至三四元者、亦無法購得、因是前（十四日）昨（十五）兩日、出關之旅客、均被阻於楡關、不僅平瀋車上旅客爲然、卽在楡換車出關之旅客、亦受同樣限制被阻旅客大半爲出關謀生之貧農、或爲遄返故土之關外同胞、被阻後、資斧豐足者、乃投逆旅、設法疏通、一般貧農、遂不得不露宿僻巷、三日來留楡旅客、爲數在千人以上、至於已付之關外段票價、隨時卽由東方旅行社照數退出、尙無爲難情事、彼等因不能困守旅邸、遂先行折返、日人禁止華人出關之原因、截至發稿時止、尙未能明瞭、記者今（十六）午特向交通界方面探詢、亦無結果、據稱、華籍旅客不能出關事件、路局方面、始終未接得正式情報、並稱以常理推斷、平瀋通車之恢復、本　日方之要求、以謀關內外人民之福利、日方如果眞有不准關內人民出關、則此項通車之作用何在、故認爲外傳各節、殊不可靠等語、</p>
<p>該問題各方均為驚異、且多揣測、惟在事實未能澈底證明以前、固未便武斷、但日人禁華人赴東北謀生、以便其國內向東四省盡量移民、似為事實、蓋同時古北口方面、亦發生同樣事件、據行駛北平古北口之某長途汽車公司中人稱、列年春季、如冀魯豫各省貧農、均結隊出古北口赴熱河謀生、熱河失陷後、日方卽在古北口、對出口貧農、課收「入國證」費一元、今春已放行數批、但至前（十四）日竟突然禁止、原有所謂「入國證」、亦停止發售、致連日到古北口之貧農、均困守該處、進退兩難、厥狀至慘、記者嗣向某關係方面探詢、僅答稱「此間並未接得報吿」一語而已、</p>
<p>綜上所述、古北口貧農被阻、是否與楡關乘客禁止出關、爲同一作用、頃固無從證明、但該問題如不解决、平瀋通車業務將蒙受相當影響、或在意中云、（十六日）</p>

<h3>青島生火生油　市價跌落原因</h3>
<p>積囤現貨約値千萬元　洋帮與南帮停止收買</p>
<p>靑島通訊、靑島生米生油爲出口貨物之大宗、歷年約値四千餘萬元之鉅、去冬生米生油初上市後、市價步步高漲、本市土產商家、均積極收存現貨、冀獲鉅利、不料自廢歷元宵節後、市價逐步下落、生米由八元五角五分、竟跌至六元一角、（每百斤）據調査所得、其疲價原因不外下列數端、</p>
<p>洋帮停買</p>
<p>客冬以世界農產之歉收、油類缺乏、東西洋帮在靑預爲定購、自十月間開始收買、以備今年三四月間運往歐西、故生米市價步漲、新春以來、洋帮俱已胃飽、停手觀望、以致商家所存現貨、竟無人問津、蓋靑市生米洋帮占百分之七十五、今旣停手、市價自益跌落、此其重要原因也、</p>
<p>銀貴金賤</p>
<p>洋帮對現貨旣存觀望之心、更以月來銀貴金賤、對外匯價日高、出口商自感困難、如中英先令賣價、一月八日爲十四又八分之七、本月四日竟高至十八又十六分之十三、再以中日金票同日爲一百二十四元、亦高至一百十四元、按此計算、每百元約二十餘元之差額、爲中國出口之一大打擊也、</p>
<p>金融奇緊</p>
<p>握有金融威權之上海中西銀行界、自去年總結東後、均抱緊縮政策、工商業信用收縮、周轉困難、上海旣如此、其他各埠自受影響、靑市之出口商、現貨在手、近以銀根緊急、不得不急於出售地、</p>
<p>南帮觀望</p>
<p>靑市生米、除大宗被洋帮收買外、餘則首推廣帮、次爲南甬閩漢各埠、上海銀根旣緊急如此、廣帮之流動資金、更點金乏術、再以廣東淸油量减低、自無交易可言、收貨旣不踴躍、進口自亦减少、所存現貨多半託於期貨之中、將來收貨乏人、亦大疲之原因也、</p>
<p>現貨集中</p>
<p>交易所旣可託出期貨、存現貨者爭相出售、遠期爲救一時之虧、况客冬大漲、客帮俱以奇貨可居、多存現貨、以待今春之高漲、今旣日落千丈、大戶拋出、市價必落、更以河南方面、歷年廣東漢口客商多往收買現貨、今旣問津乏人、並將積存之米油、由連雲港招商局之商輪裝運、日必巨量來靑、均售於交易所之遠期、以備交貨、蓋因靑市之交易所爲華北生米類唯一之出路、據昨日調査、靑市現存生米約七十五萬包、約計一萬三千五百萬市斤、按昨日市價計値八百一十萬元、生油約存九百餘車、計一千一百七十萬市斤、約値一百五十二萬元、以此巨量之貨存積靑市、將來四月期近、僅就交易所之結餘八千餘噸之期貨、試問誰收、况以天氣日暖、不能久存、一千餘萬市斤之油、如何出法、前途悲觀意中事也、</p>
<p>救濟乏術</p>
<p>銀行界及工商業、旣在自顧不暇之秋、金銀比價又無大力可以挽回、昨日生米已落至六元一角、較之二年前之最低價三元二角、（按老秤三元八角合市秤）仍高一倍有餘、此之年前最高價八元八角、僅落二元七角、無巨量現金收存、如何提高市價乎、</p>
<p>歐市步疲</p>
<p>客冬倫敦之中國生米、市價由九先令（倫敦交貨百斤之價）漲至十五先令三便士三、今則逐日報疲、已跌至十二先令八便士半、由此以觀、歐西現在旣步步疲落、本市西洋商之不得出貨、交易冷淡、而市價跌落必然之勢也、</p>

<h3>斗室中詳詢變態經過　姚錦屏化男訪問紀</h3>
<p>前已品頭許配邢占青師長之二公子　李杜願月助卅金命其歸返原籍求學</p>
<p>—姚君本人詳談生理變態經過—</p>
<p>—昨日起各界往訪者戶限為穿—</p>
<p>自報端刋載女化爲男之姚震（亦卽姚更生或姚錦屛）來滬以後、頓時哄動各界、認爲亘古未有之奇事、華東社記者、亦以此事頗有一研究之價値、爰於昨日、往訪此女化爲男之姚君、與之詳細談話、藉將變態經過、供國內生理學家及醫學界之研究、</p>
<p>小室之中　方在晨餐</p>
<p>姚君與其祖慶普、寓於巨籟達路采壽里十八號三樓、該處本有房屋三幢、均爲李杜部下之東北軍卷屬所居、十七號與三十五號、均爲該軍一部份男子之居、姚君旣已變態爲男、故亦偕其祖父、寓於該號三樓、當記者等入內訪問時、適姚君等正在晨餐、乃小坐片刻、待其餐竟、乃展詢其生理趣態之經過、</p>
<p>一望而知　易钗而弁</p>
<p>記者入內時、卽見由女子而變爲男子之姚震君、身衣藍色罩袍、短髪　　、分左右掠、端盆進餐、其旁則為一年逾六旬精神健康之老翁、此時不必由他人之介紹、卽知衣藍布罩袍者、乃爲姚君、蓋其儀態、仍不脫女子本相也、旋經詢問、果然不虛、與其談話時、更見其兩耳微有孔隙、蓋卽幼年穿耳所致、足略小、則經纏繞故也、至其肌理白晰晰、指尖細削、在在表現爲女子體態、所不同者、前則兩辮垂肩、今已付諸幷州之剪也</p>
<p>小桌圍坐　暢談經過</p>
<p>記者先詢其以前爲女子時之情形、姚君最初頳不能答、其祖代爲解釋、但間有不符、姚君乃自述眞相、據謂昔爲女子時、一切狀態、與女子毫無差異、十四齡時、月經已至、此後按月而來、並不間斷、在去年廢歷七月二十一日、是日忽感不適、神智且頗昏迷、飲食不進、睡於牀上、及晚忽聞震雷、始被驚醒、此際卽發覺女子之性器官、業已改變、蓋已化爲偉男矣、</p>
<p>心有所感　夢後易服</p>
<p>當時大爲驚訝、潛告於其祖母、祖母不信、探之果然、但仍頗懷疑、至翌晚、彼忽夢見一嫗、囑其速易男服、並戒以百日之內、不得見生人、於是彼始易釵而弁、鎭日閉居家內、此種奇變、舍家人外、絕無他人知悉、迄百日屆滿、始將其事洩於外、於是哄動里閭、詫爲奇聞、</p>
<p>一月之後　週身變化</p>
<p>當變態後之一月、彼悶居家內、忽然威覺渾身酸痛異常、當時大驚、但其後逐漸輕痊、一月以後恢復常態、在此時期中、彼之乳房、本頗豐滿者、突然漸漸平陷、與男子之乳部相彷、而喉頸之間、亦生一核、此或爲性器官變態後之其他各部生理變態也、</p>
<p>索書題字　頗愛女子</p>
<p>記者至此、乃詢之曰、然則變態以後、是否能如其他男子同樣發生對於女子之性感覺、姚君聞語、面頻不能卽答、乃向記者索紙、書曰『敝人現在如同男子一般無異、過百日後、見女子料有一點愛的意思』、其中料字、係屬略字之誤、但此寥寥數語、可知姚君今日身爲男子、亦已知女人之可愛、則其變態、可證明其爲完全與男子無異矣、</p>
<p>發育未全　須加修養</p>
<p>此時姚君之祖羼言曰、現下雖已變爲男子、但其生殖器官、尙未發育完全、蓋較常人爲略小、且微帶尖形也、記者乃吿以應請一醫生加以檢騐、俾可明悉其變態後之生理組織、究否健全、姚君之祖謂、尙須稍加休養、然後延醫檢騐、同時記者又聞他人吿知、李杜將軍、已决定代爲延醫檢騐、以研究姚君生理變態之是否成功也、</p>
<p>李氏資助　反里攻讀</p>
<p>又據姚君之祖父曰、此次來滬、本擬隨同李部卷屬、不日同行赴新、覓其父有堂之下落、但李將軍因其年幼、阻其前往、並爲資其深造計、願月助二三十金、命其返津繼續求學、故彼等不日、卽須遄返津門靑縣原籍也、</p>
<p>前曾字人　無形作罷</p>
<p>並謂當姚君之父在吉林時、曾將其許配第一師師長邢占靑之二公子、但當時祗口頭道及、並無婚約、故此事可不成問題、姚君前在原籍初級小學肄業時、與其姑母同級、其姑母年齡、亦爲同庚也、又姚君有一弟、年七齡、以前本爲姊弟、今則變爲兄弟矣、姚君之祖談及此事時、笑口常開、足見其老懷彌樂也、但有時涉及其子有堂下落不明時、則又黯然不歡也、昨日各方好奇往訪者、自晨至暮、聯翩不絕、可見各方好奇之一斑</p>
<p>醫界觀察　頗多疑寶</p>
<p>記者昨晨復又詢國立上海醫學院院長顏福慶博士、據稱此等生理作用、恐係俗謂「雌孵雄」之變相、在往時觀察者、以主觀不同、至認爲女者、各執己見、今一旦生育起變化、衆乃始起驚異、不過實在眞相、尙須以科學方法研究始可耳、又據醫師公會監委徐乃禮博士稱、此等事雖屬罕見、惟不能單單憑腦筋推側、卽認係事實云、惟依據其祖姚慶普之談話、則最顯明之證據、在未變化乳峯甚高、今則已平坦無痕矣、衆說紛紜、莫衷一是、誠大値得研究者也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳蘊素）</p>
<p>安樂是結束生命的棺器、勞作是延長壽命的食糧。　　無論什麽事，總要豎起脊梁幹。幹不下縐起眉頭幹，咬起牙齦幹。</p>
<p>我人應有「前人種樹，後人乘凉」的抱負，不應有「我躬不閱，遑恤我後」的念頭。</p>
<p>我人不應像賣瓜者的自吹，把自己捧上雲霄；也不應像懦夫的胆住，把自己看成半斤和八兩。</p>
<p>一個活躍的靑年，不應憧憬在歌台舞榭間，或迷戀在桃紅色的艷夢中。</p>
<p>當一個男人愛上一個女人，或一個女人愛上一個男人時，無不認對象是極端滿意，如飲香檳酒一般的芬芳可口。等到一經如願後，就立刻會戚覺到像喝着出了氣的啤酒，淡而無味，倒還是另尋新相識，換換口味的好。</p>
<h3>湯鐵</h3>
<p>— 椀公</p>
<p>「沒有「湯鐵」畫，算不得是世家。』這是蕪湖的流行語。「湯鐵」並不是用筆墨畫在紙上的畫；它是用熟鐵的扁條，搓揑成功的。山水，人物，花卉，都維妙維肯！用白紙襯着，配上一隻木框，這望着，儼然是大滌子，罌瓢子，一類的寫意畫。</p>
<p>鐵，不經火鍜，總是硬的，鍜紅了，又怎能用去搓揑呢？關於「湯鐵」捏畫的故事，是這樣的：</p>
<p>據說這湯姓鐵匠——不是鐵匠，簡直可以稱他一聲藝術家，原先是一家鐵匠店的學徒。不知怎樣被師傅驅逐掉，他失了業，生計更艱難了！在一個大年夜，他着實不想活了，沒奈何跑到陶塘去投水；當他正在撩衣一躍的時候，他的右手。忽然被旁邊閃出來的一位老者拉住了。這位老者，很慈祥的誠懇的勸導他，安慰他。他忽然覺到他的手有點火辣辣底，但是老者抓得很緊，他用力一掙，手是掙脫了，但是憑空地褪了一隻人皮手套，血和肉，都露出來，老者拍拍他的肩膀說：「好了！你從此有飯吃了！你趕快再回去打鐵罷！」他正要和老者交涉，老者倐忽沒有了‘。他捧着一隻血手，懊喪地跑回家，果然又去另外投師學打鐵。</p>
<p>有一天，在打鐵的得侯，忽然鉗子上一塊透紅的鐵，落到他的手上，他竟然不覺得燙，他很奇怪！隨手把這塊紅鐵拾起來，用力太過，居然揑扁了它。他這才明白他的手是可以入火不灼的；他從此就開始利用他的手，去捏這種鐵畫。自他死後，就沒有第二個人能做得到。所以一直到現在，都被人珍視着。</p>
<h3>長衫</h3>
<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>從前，衣服是代表着人的職業；正像臉譜是代表劇中人的身份一樣。我們看見了花臉的就知道那是莽夫，看見了白臉的，就知道那是奸雄；衣服也同臉譜一樣象徵着那個人的職業。</p>
<p>讀書人在從前佔着上等人的地位，由讀書而做官也就成了上等的職業。所謂上等人，不但生活享受要比下等人好，就是衣服也要此下等人長些，才可以顯出上等人的架子；於是被稱或自稱爲上等人的文士，就都穿起長衫來。而長衫盛行。</p>
<p>近年來，因爲歐風東漸，大家全趨於時髦，於是長衫乃被打倒；代替牠的地位的是西裝。敎授，學生，全都是洋裝革履，神氣活現，好像非如此不足以表示其爲上等人一樣。</p>
<p>但西裝只盛行於都市，鄉村里的學究，却還是一領靑衫，一步三搖，大敎授其「天地元黄」的文章。所以在鄕村，長衫仍舊是保守其上等人的賽格的。</p>
<p>記得小時候在家鄉里，有一位五十多歲的老先生，據說他在前淸還中過秀才。他無論在春夏秋冬，都穿着一件藍夏布長衫。那件長衫的袖口上破了兩個洞，藍色也泛成灰色，滿染油汚，可是他還捨不得脫下來，一直穿到下棺材的時候。</p>
<p>如斯人者，眞可稱爲「老腐敗」矣！</p>
<h3>均勢的援助</h3>
<p>— 作</p>
<h3>壹對：成雙</h3>
<p>— 金雄宇</p>
<p>吾鄕有世家子，家道小康，貌亦白晳，但性情拘謹，宛若舊式之閨女，遇異性，反赧顏不敢稍顧，年弱冠尙無匹配，其父母亦不急於擇偶。一日，鄰家有迎娶者，世家子亦參與賀，以新婦貌美，賀客鬧房之興甚豪，直至午夜始散。而世家子自鄰家飲酒歸來，突變常態，終朝吶吶，旁人諦聽之，日…乙對……成雙！有竊笑之，若不知；嗣後父母不能禁，醫藥不能治，如此盈年累月，迄今未愈，以致常鬧笑話，弄得滿街譁然，茲誌數則如此，以供一粲：</p>
<p>一，他的開口，總是…查對……成雙！熟識者司空見憤不爲意；而他的行動亦如此，凡到人家，內地房屋，都有門檻，假使所經門檻，其數非成雙者，卽已登堂入室，亦不坐不言而返；吃飯時，杯箸之數不成雙者，亦搖頭不坐，而且口中不罷的說…壹對…成雙！</p>
<p>二，他走路，逢到橋樑石級，亦默數之，石級之數如非成雙者，寗願折回，再走一遍，（是符雙數）幷且口中說…一定要壹對…要成雙！</p>
<h3>關於睡眠</h3>
<p>— （菱湖昭）</p>
<p>人類所具有的全部光陰，倒有三分之一在睡眠中費去。睡眠所得的「唯一」的益處，是休養腦力。</p>
<p>平常我們工作了一整天，自然而然會覺着身體的疾勞；　而睡眠確能夠恢復原來的精神。</p>
<p>睡眠除了休養腦力，和恢復精神之外，還能够療治飢餓。一個人如果窮得典質俱盡，連三隻銅板買大餅或油條錢也沒有的話，那祗要睡在牀上，就可以免除枵腹的痛苦。所以睡眠也是一種療飢的良劑。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>從這一日隨太后去過之後，逢到有空閒的機會，我便跑到那四五間大屋子裏去探視，果然每次都見它們比上次大一些；先是長到一寸，過一天又長到了一寸半，後來就長到了二寸長。這樣便不能再讓它們一二百條的擠在一個小盤子裏了；就由那些育蠶的女孩子們很小心地把每一盤的蠶分盛兩盤；待它們再長大起來，便再分盛入較大的竹盤裏去。</p>
<p>「幼蠶所吃的桑葉都是切得很碎的，而且都是揀的最嫩的，大約再過四五天工夫，它們就要改餵整張的大桑葉了！」一二日後，太后又這樣提醒着我。「那時候便格外好看了，你不可不去看看！」</p>
<p>依理想來，老佛爺自己必然巳曾屢次去看過這種育蠶繅絲的把戲了；園裏旣是每年要養蠶，伊當然是每年都看見的。但是伊有時候的行爲，却眞像小孩子，對於看養蠶，更是非常的起勁，似乎看十次，看一百次，都看不厭的；只要遇到政務稍暇的時候，伊往往就會想到要去看看那些正在日夜長大的春蠶。</p>
<p>這一日，那些管理育蠶的女孩子們吿訴我說，有大批的幼蠶已長成了，當日就要開始把整張的大桑葉充餵料了。（二七一）</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>飲酒</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>予酷嗜杯中物，予家目曾祖以來，累代經營紹酒業，所以對於酒的常識，比較無論何物爲豐富，現在把酒的程度利弊和秘訣，分別來說一下：（一）飲酒的程度，我們飲酒時，倘若血液一·〇〇〇中，吸收了一米里「愛的爾」酒精，就要徵醉，吸收了二米里時要昏懵三米里時哭笑無常，高歌狂論，四米里時，身體巳失支持力，五米里時知覺全失，過此就要中毒，也有因此而死亡的。可是各人的酒量大小不同，大量的人多吸收些酒精，也不要緊，這是因爲胃袋中巳爲酒精麻醉慣了，就是血液中經得起三四米里酒精的刺激，所以過了五米里以上，也不致知覺全失的；（二）飲酒的利益，大概飲了適當的酒，能够旺盛消液的分泌，帮助食物的消化，又當身體疲勞的時候，飲了酒，就會安眠，鎭定心神，假使血液循環不順，心臟衰弱的人，飲酒後，能增加血液的循環力，提高心臟的興奮性，促進體內新陳代謝的機能。尤其如紹興酒與啤酒，因爲大部分是水，而且酒精含有量很少，確有增進血液量與利尿通便的功效；（三）飲酒的弊害，酒旣有這樣利益，倘若飲了過量，也要發生大害的，就是多攝了酒精的緣故，浸透組織細膩，各器官必起變化，破壞消化器神經系血管腎臟心臟等，胃潰腸食道癌肝臟癌等，大半是飲過量的酒而起的。又有亢進血壓，變爲動脈硬化症，麻痺腦筋，甚至破壞腦的組織，罹腦充血而死者甚多，而且飲酒中毒者的子孫，往往有精神病白痴等流毒，平時舉止穩重的人，往往飲了過量的酒，不知不覺的顯出了本來面目，亂言妄語，醜態畢露，以致大失社會上的信用，姦盜詐偽之事，多在酒後發生。假使嘗飲了燒酒（高梁等）戚士克以及其他外國出產的强烈性酒，受了木精的毒，立即要頭痛昏暈嘔吐四肢腫痛呼吸逼促的。近來市中所售的高梁酒，，一般奸商爲貪圖暴利，不顧大衆的生命，竟混入多量的酒精，又紹興酒中，也有混入酒精與胡椒等，以欺瞞貧苦的酒徒，倘若飲了這等酒，大都促壽致死的。（四）飲酒的秘訣，飲酒以前，應先吃些麵包與牛奶或富於脂肪的東西，或飲一碗淸水，那末就不容易醉，徜若空腹飲酒，酒中的酒精，直接爲胃吸收，就要大醉，我們宴會時，恐怕爲友人灌醉，可先在口內含些硼砂及枳棋子，那可耐久不醉，或先吃幾個柿子，（無柿子時吃柿餅代之）與蘋果尤好，如飲酒已醉，那可用葛花煎湯飲服，或用荸薺生梨煎湯，或嗅以阿姆亞水，並用生豆腐，貼在心臟部，自然可以淸醒的，其中食柿最爲靈騐，因爲柿中含有丹銀（T　　annin）能够防止酒精吸收作用的，若飲酒發生頭痛，用重曹水或乳酸加爾秀姆一克蘭姆，冲溫水飲服奇效。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　唐突女郞前露財選色覬覦墻隙裏爲病傷廉</p>
<p>這以下，她竟是說不下去，那淚珠如線穿着一般，只管向下流着。賈多才雖然很不願意他這種行動，好在錢並沒有偸去，也不必和他十分爲難，便點點頭道：有人到我屋子裏來拿錢，要算是在太歲頭上動土，你的胆子，可算不小。不過你已經吿饒了，我也不能只是爲難你。你起來，先把撒在地上的洋錢全數檢起，回頭我們再說話。楊浣花到了這時，只有聽便別人的，自己是一點不能作難，就站起來鞠着躬道：只要你饒恕我，我什麽事都肯做的。請你不要呌起來，保存我一點顏面。賈多才點頭；好的，我饒恕着你，你放心把東西檢起來，我問你的話。可憐到了這時，他哼都不敢了，爬在地上，把遺落在地上的洋錢一塊塊的檢起來，疊好了，放在桌上。因道；賈先生，你算一算吧？我可不知道你的錢有多少？現在短了沒有？賈多才倒很同情他這句話，拿起錢來，自己一五一十數了，點頭道；不過少一塊錢。楊浣花用手拍了衣襟道：我實在沒有拿起你的。賈多才微昂着頭，沉吟了一會子道：也許落在床脚下，你不用管了，你坐下，我來問你話。楊浣花本想隨便坐在他床上，抬頭看看他的顏色，緊繃繃的很是厲害，於是立刻抽回身子，在靠窗子的一張椅子上坐下。賈多才好像還是怕他走，就坐在房門口的這把椅子上。那婦人低了頭，連述的把自己衣服的擺襟牽了兩下。賈多才道：我和你無親無故，無寃無仇，我的錢放在桌上，絲毫不犯你的事。爲什麽你說偸我的錢，是爲了不得已？這有什麽不得巳呢。（一六〇）</p>

<h3>爆竹聲中　東華奪得史高塔杯　延長時間中五比二大敗法商　表演精彩八千觀衆如癡如狂</h3>
<p>華人球隊第一次得史高塔杯</p>
<p>西聯足球會之特別錦標史高塔杯賽、巳有二十餘年之歷史、然華人球隊、向未染指、先前樂華亦僅得甲組聯賽及業巳廢除之高級杯兩錦標、對於史高塔杯幾年努力、均未能如願以償、自昨日東華在申園以五比二擊敗法商後、華人球隊遂得一試新臠、史高塔杯上、從此添一新隊名、足爲華人足球界張揚生色矣、</p>
<p>第一次勝利品</p>
<p>本屆史高塔杯東華自參戰以來、一路順風、至複賽週中、遇臘克斯打一和局、滬上球迷、無不爲東華憂慮、待二次重賽、東華卒能輕捷痛快、淘汰臘克斯、而得與法商之决賽權、於是冠軍希望、呼聲突高、昨日與法商會師申園、作最後之决勝、東華始終佔居勝勢、直搗黄龍、以爲毫無困難、不料在最後二分鐘內、被法商打成二比二和局、致使垂手可得之史高塔杯、又發生危險、幸而全軍奮發、個個努力、在延長時間中、連中三元、在四座觀衆爆竹慶祝聲中、東華以五比二打敗法商、奪得華人向未染指之史高塔杯、初試新臠、味洵美也、</p>
<p>觀衆欣喜萬狀</p>
<p>上星期間、氣候和煦、春光明媚、預料此次大賽之期、滬上球迷、必將趨之若騖、擠滿申園球塲、不料昨日天時突變、風雨交作、雖至開賽時雲散天霽、但觀衆巳大打折扣、然仍有七八千人、各人復均帶雨具到塲、以防不測、果然在下半時末、忽又陰雨四合、雨絲飄忽、普通看台、全在雨傘遮蓋之下、東華之忽盛忽衰、使個個觀衆之情緒、亦遂之而亦驚亦喜、最後東華功成圓滿時、觀衆大放爆竹、歡聲雷動、各人欣喜之狀、誠難形容、兩隊表演、美不勝收、陳洪光特爲此賽由香港趕來參加、使東華之防綫、穩固不少、陳君本季之努力巳成爲海上華人中最佳之前衛人才、工夫精深、殊非偶然、全隊呵成一氣、利用極迅速之傳遞、攻人不備、實不愧爲錦標隊、法商實力、原甚强勁、但前鋒不能合作、兩翼不能游擊、以助聲勢、實爲致敗之由、中堅派克、已成過去人物、　動遲笨、不足以禦如狼似虎之東華前鋒、而東　防禦之堅固、亦爲法商前棧不能聯絡之一大　因、然兩隊表演之佳、使各個觀衆、無不心滿意足、無時無刻、不在緊張之時期中、</p>
<p>局勢驚驗非凡</p>
<p>上半時僅由東華李義臣攻入法商一球、下半時開賽十分鐘時、賈幼良在中條地位亦中一只、東華遂以二比零佔絕對優勢、受觀衆之熱烈祝賀、不料自比以後，東華竟放棄進攻、全力主守、遂致無再勝之機會、而徒然四面受敵、處於被壓迫之地位、在在有後顧之憂、此爲東華之最大失策、因此被法商小華特攻破龍門、入後在最後二分鐘内、又被柯沙造成二比二之和局、以絕對之勝勢、而造成如此結果、莫不爲之提心吊膽、延長時間中、幸氣燄不衰、再接再厲、連中三元、方得最後之勝利、</p>
<p>雙方失機會</p>
<p>比賽時間既屆、東華獨不見李義臣到塲、裁判員馬許爾下令動員、東華前鋒祗四人作戰、戴麟經撥球先攻、被法商鮑沙脫截住還擊、柯拉沙柯萊脫大施活動、東華後方甚急、陳洪光兩次在門下救出阿斗、博得掌聲不少、東華　脫離險地、戴萬二將引兵進攻、賈幼良邊疆助陣、結果一事無成、八分鐘時、李義臣姗姍入塲、兩軍開始激戰、精彩百出、鮑沙晚對門横掃、柯拉沙右邊還擊、球彈球門横木斜飛而出、東華險極、義臣在中央交球萬象華、萬穿過雷米狄、戴麟經奔上接應、欲射被阻、縛挑右方、賈幼良奔上頭頂、華特雙乎接得、化險爲夷、</p>
<p>李義臣開紀錄</p>
<p>至此、東華攻勢極盛、法商僅有招架之力、而無反攻機會、派克遲鈍、中路時有疏漏、戴麟經得以大爲活動、戴李聯絡、而進、衝至門下、球反落在背後、同時敵方馬山兒臬谷洛夫、亦隨李戴衝前、反身救球不及、卒被李義臣捷足先得、一射中的、紀錄乃開、四座歡聲如春雷暴發、同時爆竹紙花與坐墊滿塲齊飛、法商受此挫折、攻勢亦較前劇烈、鮑沙脫在角球地位、送球門前、轉成右面角球、經法凡怯送出後、柯拉沙兩度攻門未下、此後雙方各有機會、均不得逞、尤以戴麟經在敵門前六七碼處、攻門被馬山兒、救出最爲可惜、</p>
<p>幼良獨闖番營</p>
<p>上半時過後、法商一鼓作氣、大有先發制人之概、小華特送出美麗之角球、李寗保駕有功、殺出重圍、十分鐘時賈幼良乘對方內部空虛之際、一人盤球殺進、馬山兒隨後窮追、比及門下、賈向門角側射、球徐徐滾進網去、守門華特顧此失彼、反身不及、瞠目以對、東華遂勝第二球、義臣亦如法泡製、獨闖潘營、這得角球、小萬送出、被派克救出、大華特接送前方、柯拉沙逼至罰球綫上、飽沙脫射門甚急、陸鍾恩托出後方、飽沙脫代小華特踢角球、東華深溝高壘、法商無可奈何、後陳家球一次攻門、力道甚足、被守門妙接、彩聲不絕、</p>
<p>一失足成和局</p>
<p>自比以後、東華忽然改變戰略、力取守勢、意欲保持局面、詎知大為失計、反而處處受敵、予法商全力進攻、馮運佑在門前三十碼處犯乎球被罰、雷米狄輕撥與馬山兒、馬射門成角球、法凡怯送出、小華特頂成野球、錯過機會、三十五分鐘時、小華特得法凡怯之高球、追上頭頂、球落地跳入門去、陸鐘恩竟然失手、被法商拔回一城、從此法商聲勢愈盛、堅持五分鐘後、法商忽以全軍包圍東華球門、聯珠發射、東華左衝右突、殺不出重圍、法凡怯得空打門、陸鐘恩拍出、柯拉沙在人業中還以一脚、又中要害、遂成二比二平手、四座爲之愕然、比及中央開球、九十分鐘法定時間巳至、不得不延長時聞、再决雌雄、</p>
<p>義臣巧放冷箭</p>
<p>檸檬止渴以後、法商喧賓奪主、聲勢洶洶、東華仍在被壓迫之地位、枕戈待旦、候機發動、法凡怯兩次射鬥、均成野球、戴麟經忽然得機、單獨殺進、巳入無人之境、至適當地點、後有馬山兒拚命趕來、戴急於發射、竟成野球、殊爲可惜、未幾李義臣在邊陲遞去一球、法商守門接住、因欲避免戴麟經、持球行走四步被罰、法商全部人馬排列門下、東華用誘敵之計、先由陳家球奔前、欲踢而反向後撥、法商陣脚一動、義臣拉起一腳、球已飛入網底、時間經濟、計策精妙、觀衆采聲大作、東華又佔上風矣、</p>
<p>義臣又建兩功</p>
<p>十五分鐘過後、又互易陣地、雙方均作牛飲、待裁判員鳴笛開賽、法商又有多人在塲外痛飲、見球已被東華殺至門前、乃急急如漏網之魚、趕入塲去、馬山兒見機不妙、踢成角球、賈幼良踢出後、陳家球首先發射、義臣加上一脚、又建奇功、東華遂穩操勝利之券、最後四分鐘時、雙方在精疲力竭中、李義臣又建一功、造成五比一之結果、奪得史高塔杯、當塲由西聯會會長葛林姆旭發獎、陸鍾恩授杯、在羣衆熱烈慶祝中凱旋、兩隊出塲人員如下、</p>

<h3>西聯足球甲組賽　優游大勝西捕　四與一之比</h3>
<p>昨日午前細雨濛濛、如斷如續、足球比賽、勢將延期、直至下午二時有半、雨雖不絕、然終未由小而大、優游與西捕、始得如期在虹口園作西聯甲組賽之一幕、圍觀者、頗爲踴躍、約計其數、不下五六百人、比賽結果、上半時優游即以三對一佔先、下半時優游再進一球、遂以四對一大獲勝利、</p>
<p>三對一優游佔先</p>
<p>比賽開始、優游即取攻勢、前鋒銳利非凡、未二分鐘、孫錦順得球力射、西捕守門迎以一脚、由陳士凱腿上彈入網窠、優游愈戰　勇、劉祖儒邊陲傳中、孫錦順及時趕到、翻身一勾、球從右下角而入、此球踢來、殊見工夫、無何、奚巧生沿邊進襲、又中鵠的、凈獲三球、西捕連失三球、全軍憤懣、乃傾師反攻、卒由中鋒攻進一球、造成三對一之比、混戰良久、上半時終、優游即以三對一佔先、</p>
<p>四比一優游凱旋</p>
<p>再戰聲中、西捕努力反攻、鋒芒暴露、三分鐘內、優游儘受壓追、幸王江兩衛、防禦得當、得能化險爲夷、後優游力圖振作、孫錦順陳士凱雙騎並進、鐵腿一揮、又以中的聞、但鍾勇森越位作廢、殊爲可惜、嗣後此攻彼收、各有安危、優游卒以四對一勝、</p>

<p>友華足球隊在中華會足組中、每戰皆捷、昨日下午三時與江南隊作錦標賽於江南球塲、友華雖因健將賈幼良謝桂銓雁紀文等之缺席、但卒賴將士用命、仍以四對三力挫江南、而獲得足組冠軍、</p>
<p>球證鄧海瀾、號解一聲、雙方列陳交兵、友華隊三軍一心、傾師猛攻、左內鋒邱天生、乘隙拉弓、球從鬥柱彈出、右翼劉岱南垓起義、首開紀錄、江南隊見失一球、反攻甚烈、友華右前衛楊桂生勤王心切、毛手毛脚、被判罰十二碼、江南兪耀華一蹴而中、俄而友華左內鋒陸守賢帶球前進、江南後衛阻之不及、對門力搗、應聲入網、江南於是怒髮冲冠、中鋒兪耀華單力赴會、建功而歸、上半二對二平分秋色、</p>
<p>易地再戰、友華中堅吳錫泉百步穿揚、巧立一功、江南亦不甘示弱、由左翼攻入一球、友華至此、全軍煥發、又肆攻擊、左內鋒陸守賢奮不顧身、連人帶球、衝入網中、均是友華以四對三高奏凱歌、附陣綫如下、</p>

<p>主席報告聯誼意義</p>
<p>行禮如儀、首由主席陶百川閩述聯誼運動意義、略謂上海市黨部舉行中等學校優秀學生聯誼運動、其目的在使學生與本黨發生密切情感、我們知道靑年是將來國家的主人翁、而中學生尤爲靑年優秀份子、中國因爲敎育的不普及、在四萬萬七千萬人口中能受中等敎育者、祇四十七萬人、僅佔全人口千份之一、因此上海特別市黨部對於中等學生極爲看重、蓋中學生均爲民族中優良份子、國民黨是領導國民做着復興中華民族工作、但此項工作、極爲艱鉅、非少數人的力量所能勝任、我們熱望靑年們能共同担負起這種責任、因此我們今天舉行這聯誼會、目約在使中學生除了軍事敎育、道德敎育、生產敎育之外、能够得到一些政治教育、因為我們認為這四種教育有同樣的重要、同時我們要使青年切實認識中華民族　一定可以復興、因為我們在時間上與代間上都可以得到一種證明、我們更認識要復興我們的民族、非實行三民主義不可、我們希望因此次聯誼運動之舉行、靑年與本本感情更爲密切云云、</p>
<p>吳氏演說青年責任</p>
<p>次由社會局長吳醒亞演說略謂今日本人參加二屆一次聯誼運動、内心無限愉快、因爲今日參加學生、寂靜無喧、巳能做到新生活運動中之整齊、使余深信聯誼運動已有成效、今後的希望、能使過去之成績更爲充實、不但在形式上有進步、更希望在精神上有極大的進展、中學生是靑年中優良份子、我們希望中學生以此種精神領導人們、共同負担起救國的責任、認定要復興民族、非實行三民主義不可、同時非從個人做起不可、遵照新運所提示之禮義廉恥做基點、切實的做去、使個人成爲一健全的人、顧林亭有言曰『國家興亡、匹夫有責』諸位想匹夫尙須負起國家興亡的責任　麼民族中優秀份子的中學生責任、當然更重總理曾分革命的程序爲三、即「軍政」「訓政」「政』而此三時期中最重要者則爲訓政、我們熱切地希望中學生們能够代替國家訓導一千個國民、諸位中學生、你們要知道國民黨對於靑年認爲是本黨的靈魂、生命綫、本黨的繼承者、希望共同來實行三民主義、共同來救中國與復興民族云云、</p>
<p>沈氏報告蘇俄印象</p>
<p>末由工務局長沈怡報告遊俄印象略謂本人此次由出席在德召集國際工程會議及黄河試騐之便、順路赴蘇俄觀光、在俄留約三星期、觀察所得、頗多感想、本人此去、以工程師資格作前往觀光、所到之處、計有莫斯科·及列寗格勒兩地、作四種之觀察、（上）五年計劃爲何產生、（二）五年計劃中之水力發展、（三）蘇俄工程人材之如何養成、（四）蘇俄市政、最使余感動者即蘇俄工農學生之勤勞、在蘇俄不工作耶不能生存、終身之勞働而僅能一飽、且衣食住行均極簡單、但蘇俄人民均無恨色、蓋蘇俄人民認爲建設國家、人民應盡之責任、因之五年計劃能順利推行、而蘇俄執政者之以身作則、衣食住行、與民無異、即斯塔林亦僅居室二間、他如學校規律之嚴、學風優良、絕無罷課等事發生、工人亦耐苦從事、罷工之事在蘇俄從未一見、他如委員制創始於蘇俄、今則巳改變此制度、蓋蘇俄認爲欲推進建設、非有一領袖負責不可、且其部下必須服從、蘇俄爲一高唱世界革命之國家、但一入其國、則僅聞蘇俄蘇俄之聲、蓋彼輩正在爲其民族苦幹也、世界革命之聲浪、僅爲口號、因此我人有一感想、我人切不可忘我忘本、爲今之計、應如何爲我國家爲我民族而努力也云云、</p>
<p>放映影片分送贈品</p>
<p>沈氏演講完畢後、即放映影巨片、並由新人周刊社分發到會學生新人周刊半年、定單一紙、麗都大戲院及中國敎育電影協會亦備有優良贈品、分送到會學生、至一時許始攝影散會云、</p>

<h3>西貢三號米之徵稅問題</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>最近板書謂碎米增稅問題者，實則卽為西貢三號米一種之稅則問題、初以三號西貢米含碎米多至百分之六十，故進口完納半稅。不料以全稅與半稅之關係，海外市價，竟與一號米價相差無幾。致與我國减稅以惠貧民之原意不符，徒爲經售之洋商殖利，因此而有應否加稅之一舉。</p>
<p>進口洋米之徵稅，原爲保護本國之米產起見，如曰從民食着想，則何如照以前辦法，進口免稅可也。旣徵稅矣，稅則之高低，自應從徵稅品之本身估量，方爲允當。三號米雖碎米占其百分之六十。然非全部碎米也明甚。旣非全部碎米，尙含有百分之四十之完整米，而照碎米得折半上稅，已見其有不公允處。再則西貢一號米含碎米百分之二五，二號米含碎米百分之四十，皆照納全稅（每百公斤一·六五金單位）。而比二號米多含百分之二十之碎米（卽三號米），所納之稅，卽可减少百分之五十，（卽·八三金單位），未免寬於三號，苛於二號，此所以二號米絕跡而三號米獨得暢銷也。故從所含碎米之多寡以論，三號米縱不照納全稅，亦應照納三分之二（一·一金單位）之稅，換言之，至少約當於每百公斤徵一個金單位之進口稅。至如全部爲碎米，自可比照穀物繳納半稅也。</p>
<p>更從市價以論，在正常之市况下，三號西貢米比一號米，約小一元，比二號米僅小五角。然如大絞米何嘗不比西貫一號米約小一元之譜，而亦照徵全稅。又如暹羅一號米比西貢一號米約高起一元五角之譜，仍徵同等之稅，則西貢一號米比三號米所高僅一元之數，稅則相差至一半，未免不類。觀下表可見滬市所銷各種洋米價格高低之差額。然在市面有大變動時，情况自殊，此則仍指正常之市况，其差額又爲約計數而言，至以西貢一號米作標準，亦不過藉便比較而已。（市價差額單位元）</p>
<p>等級上　市價差額　標準　等級下　市價差額</p>
<p>暹羅一號米　一·五　西貢一號米　西貢二號米　〇·五　西貢三號米　一·〇</p>
<p>暹羅二號米　一·〇　碎米　三·〇</p>
<p>暹羅三號米　〇·五　小絞米　〇·五　大絞米　一·〇</p>
<p>現市相差約在兩元之數，</p>
<p>故西貢三號米，倘徵全稅，則爲稅品之係屬問題，稅則可無容變動。若必欲略分軒輊，則非加例條欵分別徵稅不可。有如</p>
<p>碎米　（甲）含有百分之六十以上碎粒者　一·〇〇</p>
<p>（乙）全爲碎粒者　〇·八三</p>
<h3>蘇俄糧食工業的發展</h3>
<p>— 趙簡子</p>
<p>（一）叙言</p>
<p>如今在蘇俄，建立起近代的糧食工業（Fod　Industry）不過是最近三四年以來的事實。戰前，一般地說，帝俄是沒有所謂糧食工業，那時糧食的生產主要地由用半人工的工廠，農地，麵包舖等完成的。就在第一個五年計劉開始時，蘇俄才設立了許多大的具有近代機械裝置的糧食工廠。這些工廠的生產是大規模的。因爲在此時期，都市和產業中心地急遽地發生，以及許多工業大企業之興起，糧食的供給便日漸增加，而進行糧食生產的工廠也因而有大規模生產之必要。隨着新興都市和新建立的產業中心地之勃起，勞動人口自然也日益增大。這時，舊的小規模糧食生產不能供應這日益增大的人口之需求，乃自然之理。例如，在一九二　年，人口在一〇〇、〇〇〇左右的蘇俄都市　有三一個。及至一九三一年，具有如此人口數的都市增至四六個，而人口在一〇、〇〇〇左右的都市在一九二六年爲四七九個，至一九三一年便增至五〇七個。再進一步說，蘇俄一般人口購買力（Purchasing　Power）的增加，及文化水準（Cultural　Standard）的提高，其結果自然也需求好品質和各種不同的糧食生產品。</p>
<p>一九三〇年秋季，糧食工業各門部在國內糧食供給部（The　Commissariat　for　Internal　Supply）指揮之下，形成統一。隨着產業的急遽發展，國內糧食供給部的工作便大大擴大，而非一部所能勝任，於是一九三四年七月國內糧信供給部即分而為二部—一部是主持國內貿易，一部是主持糧食工業。</p>
<p>在大規模的農業集體化（Intenive　Collectivization）時期，家吝是躉賣宰殺的，因此便發生肉類及乳酪生產品之缺乏，從而糧食工業的發展受到打擊。更由交通的不方便和運輸機關的缺乏，糧食工業的發展益感種種之困難。雖然有這些打擊和困難，但是從整個方面看來，蘇俄糧食工業却是年復年地在慢慢發展。</p>
<p>一九三三年，蘇俄糧食工業的產額總達六十憶盧布，較之一九二八年的總值數雪大了三又二分之一倍。一九三四年上半糧食生產額較之一九三三年同一季，是大分之二四。至於罐頭食品及糖果的出產總是出乎意外的大大增加。一九三三年，罐品的出產額較之五年前的數字不　大了八而糖果的出產額較之五年前的數字又不啻五倍。他如人造乳（Margarine），罐頭牛乳等新出產品，在過去這幾年已開始製造了。</p>
<p>在一九三三年糧食生產中，中國內糧食供給部指揮的糧食工業共值四、八三六百萬盧布，而由人民委員會的糧食徵收委员會（The　Proourements　Committee　of　The　Council　of　People＇s　Commessars管轄的糧食生產，—主要地是磨帉廠的生產—共值一、一六〇百萬盧布。</p>
<p>至於糧食原料（Row　Materials）的供给，由於大規模的國家和集體農塲急遽發展的結果，各種農產品投諸市塲的數額也相當地增加，這些農產品如榖類，糖蔗，馬鈴薯，及各種蔬菜。更由各種合作社（Cooperatives）興趣，交通機關和運輸工具也大大改進。如今，大規模的社會化的飲食館（Restaurants），設立普及全俄國各地，此種欦食館網狀之形成，便减輕了糧食分配的種種困難。而在糧食分配方面，更重要的莫過於糧食分配中心地之緊密的設立，這些中心地設立的目的在供給勞動於特殊產業企業的勞動者以食糧。</p>
<p>從一九二八年到一九三三年，投資於糧食工業的資本額共計三十億盧布，而在一九二四年到一九二八年同樣時期中，投資於糧食工業的資本額僅有五億盧布，前者較之後者不啻大了六倍。至於這些資本，大部分是用於建築新的大的糧食生產工廠。這些工廠的建築及裝置都是根據最近代的建築和裝置，尤其是採用美國的技術（American　Technique），達於很大的範圍。在過去五年中，新起的糧食工業工廠而在開始生產的爲數共計在七〇〇以上。至於裝置在這些新工廠的機械和機械設備都是從外國輸入的。</p>
<p>（二）　近代式糧食工業之建設</p>
<p>在一九二九年以前，肉類包裝（Meat—paoking）是在舊的屠塲進行，沒有冷藏設備（Refrigerating　Equipment），也沒有製造肉類副產品的機關。但自一九二九年以後，蘇俄建立了一一十個大的肉類包裝廠，並且從舊屠塲改建了許多新屠塲，以爲除供屠殺牲畜以外，並爲製造臘腸品（Sausage　Products）脂肪品，及鬃毛之用。一九二八年末，投入於肉類包裝業的基本資本（Basic　Capital）爲六〇百萬盧布，至一九三三年末便增至三五○百萬虜布。</p>
<p>如今，蘇俄有兩個最大的肉類包裝廠，一個在莫斯科，一個在靠近列寗（Leningrad）的（Srednaya　Rogatka）第二個五年計劃更規定本年建築一個臘腸製造廠，復規定建築其他次要肉類製造廠。由於新的肉類製造廠的建立，及近代機械裝置之設備，結果，一九三〇年至一九三三年，牛之屠宰數量便由百分之五五增加到百分之七三·五，至一九三四年，則更增加至百分之七六。</p>
<p>罐頭業（Canning　Inonlly）在第一個五年計劃開始時期，蘇俄只有二二個罐頭廠，每年出產總額爲一〇〇百萬罐頭。至一九三二年末罐罐頭廠便增至四八八個，每年出產總額爲十億罐頭。有些新成立的罐頭廠在世界上可算是最大的罐頭廠，其每年的出產總額各自九〇百萬罐頭至一〇〇百萬罐頭不等、在新建立的罐頭廠內，一切勞動過程都是施行機械化，而生產行程的組織是採行運输制（Conveyor　System）的。至於罐頭牛乳業，在一九三二年以後亦開始了。如今有幾個罐頭牛乳廠，根據美國最近代的技術，已紹建築完工。在新製造的許多頭出產品中，還有醃肉（Corn），蕃茄，豬，大豆等罐頭食品。</p>
<p>蘇俄又設立了新的具有近代裝置的麵粉廠和糖廠，在這些麵粉廠和糖廠中，有的是設立在舊日工業不大發展的地方如Kazak　an，西伯利亞及遠東區。一九三〇年才開始出產。還有其他許多新廠最近才開始設立，以爲製造綫麵和通心粉（Spaghatti　and　MaCaroni），糖果，不含有酒精的飲料，澱粉和糖蜜，醃肉出產品，豆乳等。在一九二九年至一九三二年中，有七個大煉糖廠，每日煉糖量爲八五至三四〇噸精糖、人造乳出產，亦集中在七個大工廠，每年出產總量各自六，〇〇〇噸到二〇，〇〇〇噸不等。機械化的大麵包製造廠，一九三〇年爲數六七個，每日製造量爲四，四〇〇噸，至一九三三年，麵包廠數便增至二二一個，製造亦增至一三，五〇〇噸，更加了五八個新的大烘顂包廠（Baking　Plants），每日烘麵包三，六五〇噸。此外，尙有一六九個小烘麵包廠，一九三三年的麵包出產總額計達麵包五，七〇〇，〇〇〇噸，而一九三四年的計劃規定麵包製造總額須達七，一〇〇，〇〇〇噸，故蘇俄的麵包可以不再加限制了。</p>
<p>魚在蘇俄國內糧食市塲上居於很重要的地位，由於近年來冷藏廠和罐頭廠設立的結果，蘇俄人民除乾魚或鹹魚（Dry　or　Salted　fish）的供給外，更有新鮮的魚或罐頭魚的供給。戰前，乾魚或鹹魚成爲蘇俄人民魚類供給的主要部分，如今却被新鮮的魚或罐頭魚的供給取而代之了。蘇俄魚類供給的源泉在世界上實是居於重要的地位。即在戰前，帝俄的漁業採用舊式方法，然而她的漁業仍不失其在世界的重要生。一九三〇年蘇俄魚類出產總額竟超過戰前出產總額的百分之三〇，而且也超過丁第一個五年計劃最後一年所規定的魚煩出產額數字。從漁業方面看來，如今蘇俄是居世界第二位。在第一個五年計劃時期，投資於漁業的資本共在三五〇百萬盧布以上，而這些資本主要地是用於建築冷藏和罐頭廠。至於冷藏廠和罐頭廠的機械裝置都是購自外國，而購自美國的要居大半。漁業的主要中心地爲瓦爾加，裏海區（Volga　caspian　region），此區的魚類出產槪佔蘇俄魚類出產總額的半數。但是亞得蒂，白海（Arctic-white　sea）和遠東的漁業，却以從事於深海的捕魚（Deep-Ses　fishing）,日漸增高其漁業的重要性。一九一三年到一九三三年，蘇俄漁業的發展從百分之一七增加到百分之三四，五，增加的百分數不能說是很小了。</p>
<p>三　第二五年計劃與糧食工業</p>
<p>第二個五年計劃規定在糧食工業的各門部設立許多新的工廠。在一九三二至一九三七這五年中，投資於糧食工業的資本規定爲五·三四十億盧布，而在此數中，四九五百萬盧布規定用於肉類裝包業，九〇〇百萬盧布用於漁業，一，一〇〇百萬盧布用於糖業，一一〇百萬盧布用於糖果業，一八三百萬盧布用於罐頭業，及三〇〇百萬盧布用於乳酪業。糧食工業的總出產額規定一九三七年，較之一九三二年應增加百分之二五六。在第二個五年計劃時期，糧食工業主要項目的新計劃發屬如下表所示：</p>
<p>出產品　單位　一九三二　一九三七</p>
<p>肉類　千噸　四三五　一、二〇〇</p>
<p>魚類　千噸　一、三三三　一、八〇〇</p>

<p>皮酒　公石　四、一七九　七、五〇〇</p>
<p>不含有酒精的飲料　公石　六、〇七五　一六、〇〇〇</p>
<p>在第二個五年計劃時期，蘇俄應再設立一七個肉類裝包廠，而在此數中，如今已有一部份完成，將要開始肉類裝包工作。此外，應設立二三個新裝包廠，每年出產要達五四一，〇〇〇噸，建築費爲六二〇百萬盧布，又規定設立二三個罐頭廠。建築費預計爲一一八百萬慮布，每年出產規定須共達五二三百萬罐頭，粉牛乳（Powdered　milk）每年出產額須達一，二五〇噸。至一九三八年末，蘇俄即有三〇個新的煉糖廠，可煉二九，〇〇〇噸糖蔗，更規定設立八個澱粉糖蜜廠，二〇個通心粉廠，四三　糖果廠，及七三個冷藏廠。</p>

<h3>英屬馬來之民食問題</h3>
<p>— 汪中</p>
<p>南洋英屬馬來半島形如鶴頸，直出於印度洋太平洋之間，北連暹羅，東接中國海，西面馬六甲海峽，與印度洋相通，計長四百三十五英里，東西最凋處計長二百英里。附屬島嶼，星羅棋布，從中認為最重要者，推新加坡與檳椰嶼二島，總計面積為五萬二千五百九十五平方英里，略與荷屬東印度之爪哇相同。各島間面積之最大者，首推擁有一萬四千平方英里之彭亨；最小者檳榔嶼，祇有面積一百平方英里。馬來中央山脈最高之處爲大行山，達七千二百尺，山勢由北至南，稍形灣曲，故地勢即由此而分東西，而河川之分向東西流者，方較南北流爲多。河川除彭亭河外，均不甚大，小者僅通木筏。海港之堪稱重要者，新加坡與檳椰嶼而已。馬來對外貿易之由新嘉坡出入者，占三分之二。檳榔嶼開港時期雖先於新嘉坡，地利關係，日就衰微。</p>
<p>馬來雖號稱農業國，而國中所需食糧之米，十九仰給於暹羅緬甸越南。馬來種稻面積總計為六十七萬五千餘英畝，穀產約一億五千七百八十餘加侖。前年風調雨順，年穀豐登，米產區面積及產領數字，有如左紀</p>
<p>國別　面積（英畝）　穀產（千加侖）</p>

<p>（右表依據一九三二年馬來聯邦海峽政府報告）</p>
<p>如其分別水旱稻而言，則水稻占種植總面積之百分比，約在八十以上。如其分別產地面言，則產米區城不屬於馬來聯邦之各國。馬夾土人往昔已知種稻，而土壤又非不宜於種稻，何以不成爲產米區域。推原其故，約有下列二種原因，（一）土著人數過人，賦性又不喜務農，加以　稻之利微，不及種植摇錢樹之橡膠遠甚。（二）當地政府經濟政策，偏重於外來之資木家，不甚注意於米種之改良。馬來人種至爲椱雜，總人口約計在三百三十五萬餘（華僑占百分之三十面至四十）每年每　人所需之食糧，　國　種族不同而有其差異。就一普遍成人言，平均年需一千鎊之固形食物。如以耕地而積拆算之，則每人　得不及十分之　。所以馬來每年須輸入五千萬元以上外來食糧。自一九一九年馬來鬧過食糧恐慌之後，政府深感馬來米食自給問題之重要，乃採積極政策自制種稻。現在馬來種稻面積，得有如上述之六十餘萬英畝者，皆受强制種稻之賜。馬來聯邦之米產　與，除農務局多方獎勵外，尙有一食糧生產管理委員會，指導一切食糧問題以求馬來米產完全達於自給之目的。但一九三三年時，暹米輸入新嘉坡，計爲四一四·六六六噸，同時期緬甸米輸入馬來者，共計三三五·四五一噸，越南米輸入，總共一五·七八八噸。馬來輸入額中，除一切工業製品外，終是以米爲主，此爲號稱農產區域之馬來，對外貿易上之一大缺點。</p>

<h3>公共衛生進化史</h3>
<p>— 衛生署衛生敎育系主任朱繼靑講（成心良筆記）</p>
<p>（一）概論</p>
<p>要講公共衛生的進化。要先講到宇宙的起始。社會的進化。與醫學觀念的變遷。因爲公共衛生。是一種人類的文化。是一種社會進化的產物。所以本文先從宇宙的起始。說到社會的進化。再說到醫學觀念的變遷。再說到公共衛生的演進。本文作者的意思。是要把公共衛生進化的程序。供獻給大家參考。至於某氏某年某發明某物。非本文作者思想範圍之內。姑從略。</p>
<p>我們知道史冊上有很長很長的時間。集合很多很多人的經騐在上面。是非得失。我們看了史記。就可以把古人的經騐。變成我們的經騐。我們就可以省了不少的路途。所謂抄捷徑。所謂迎頭趕上去。</p>
<p>所以要研究或是實地幹公共衛生的人員。都得要知道公共衛生的史乘。及其有關係的各事務。</p>
<p>（二）宇宙的起始</p>
<p>宇宙初起。所謂混沌初開。乾坤也剛定。氣之淸輕而上浮者爲天。所謂氣之重濁。而下凝者爲地。這時宇宙以大。旋轉滂礡。大氣中漸有半固體物。被棄旁離。而成太陽。星球。月球。地球等。……</p>
<p>這時地球上熱得像火熱一般。簡直不能生物。又過了相當的長時間。地球表面。因爲多與空氣接觸。而趨冷淡。纔有生物居住。</p>
<p>最初的動物。是一種單細胞的動物。這時簡直沒有什麽可以記載。</p>
<p>又過了相當的長時間。人類開始漸漸進化。而有衣食住行。婚姻制度。宗社觀念……等。這當然要經過很長的時期。不是百年千年的事</p>
<p>我們才把進化的歷程。計算在下面。（係約計數）</p>
<p>歷史上有人類已三十萬年。</p>
<p>又過又二十八萬年光景。人類才知道有自己。</p>
<p>大約到二十九萬五千年以後。人類才粗有文化可言。</p>
<p>到了距今二千年。人類的文化。才有相當的進步。直到距今三百年。人類纔走到科學的時紀。享受科學的賜予。</p>
<p>（三）社會的演進</p>
<p>初有人類。還不是和其他的動物一樣。人類的最初生活情形。我們無從稽考。單說有文字紀載的時候。那時第一個間題。便是食的問題。所謂茹毛飲血。食的問題解决了。但是身上沒有遮被。是冷的。—皮膚已經退化。所謂夏葉而冬皮。衣的問題也解决了。又要忙到住的問題。所謂架木爲樑。以禦風雨。住的問題。也解决了。人類究屬是進化的。還有洪水猛獸。其他的不测呢。於是人類想到防禦危險的法子。如集屋而居。以石子爲武器。保甲模型。人類衣食住的問題解决了。危險也减少了。於是想到繁殖種族的計劃了。因爲要永遠的傳下去，。保持自己的利益。於是有所謂婚姻制度。宗社觀念。……這時的文化。已經大有可觀了。可是婚姻制度。宗社觀念。……這終屬是狹義的文化。進化的人類。是不爲他所限的。社會上人類。是多麼相互的有關係。誰都有直接間接各盡各的責任。以供獻於社會大衆的義務。這就是現在所走到的社交時代。</p>
<p>（四）醫學與社會的關係及其觀念的變遷</p>
<p>（一）醫學與社會的關係。社會旣然是突地進化到這種程度。繁密複雜。自不待言。醫學與社會。自有一種相互聯繫。而不可分離的關係。人類要是沒有醫學。簡直是毁滅了。沒有醫學。就沒有健康。就會生病。就可以沒有人類。還有文化嗎。自然我所說的醫學。是整個保護和促進人類健康的科學。不是簡單而消極以病爲對象的療病醫學。</p>
<p>（二）中國醫學觀念的變遷。可分三個時期。</p>
<p>（一）消極時期。我國自從社會開化。一直到現在。約四千餘年。都在消極的時期中。怎麽說呢？因爲在這時內。沒有防疫。沒有保健。所謂醫學。都是以病爲對象。能够把病看好。就是名醫。而且看病。祗是病的治療的一部分。沒有所謂生理病理。總而言之。凡是以病爲對象的醫學。都是消極的醫學。</p>
<p>（二）過渡的時期—大約是距今二百年到現在。人類戚受科學的洗禮。已經覺悟醫學的眞價値。不是簡簡單單的以病爲對象的療病的消極醫學。看病就算完了嗎。還有半死不死。半健不健的人眞多呢。所以醫學的眞價値。乃是供獻人類。以整個健康的科學。</p>
<p>但是五千年來。根深蒂固的社會。對於醫學觀念。還沒有澈底明瞭。消極醫學。在社會上所佔有的位置。更是牢不可破。要想快刀斬刀麻。一口氣把消極的要變成積極的。事實上是不可能的。否則或者要流血。聰明的人類。就想了一種折中辦法。這辦法就是過渡時期。一方面把消極的轉到積極的程途。一方面又不致流血。這時期又分着四個步驟。（未完）</p>
<h3>皮膚的衛生和皮膚病的預防（三）</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>以上把預防皮膚病的一般注意。已經講過了。現在來講皮膚的局部衛生法。第一就是皮膚的淸潔方法。用冷水或熱水淸拭皮膚或洗浴。因爲水能够使皮膚的角層膨脹。呌他軟化。因此可以排除表皮的廢物。同時附着於皮膚的汗，皮脂，塵埃等。也可以除去。熱水的功效。較冷水更佳。有一種呌做硬水的。就是水的成分裏面。含着石灰和鎂的　類。因此可以刺戟過敏的皮膚。變成粗糙。所以顏面皮脂缺乏的人。應當禁止使用。如果非用不可的時候。最好把煮沸的水裏面。加些硼砂或蜜糖。倘使遇到皮脂多的皮膚（脂漏性）。用硬水洗滌。反屬便利。</p>
<p>熱水的溫度。對於皮膚溫度的調節有影修。因此刺戟皮膚的神經。使生理作用亢進。但是溫度過高的時候。反有障碍。也不可不注意。習慣上以普通的體溫爲標準。稍少高些（攝氏三十五六度）也沒有妨碍。入浴的時候。用肥皂洗滌。可以把皮膚完全淸潔。或浴中放些糖汁也好。還有洗浴的時候。用柔軟的刷子。輕擦全身的皮膚。和出浴的時候。用冷水淋漓全身。都隨各人的所好。可以施用。但有一種注意的地方。就是出浴以後。應當用乾的毛巾。稍稍强擦皮膚。不可忘記。倘若皮脂少而且粗糙的皮膚。拭乾以後。還可以用脂肪類。極薄的塗布全身。</p>
<p>上面所講入浴雖有種種的利益。但失之過多。容易使體力弛緩。全身皮膚失去皮脂。變成粗糙。反者容易受着感冒。所以入浴的回敎。須隨各自的情形。應當變動。每二日或三日施行一次。洗浴的時候。爲充分淸潔起見。可照上面所講。用些糠汁和肥皂。有一種職業上容易使身體不潔的時候。就是每日洗浴。也是應當。</p>
<p>第二爲藥浴和溫泉。醫師爲治療皮膚病。嘗把種種的藥液。放入浴水中。呌病人洗浴。所用的藥。當然隨着病的情形有不同。不能一一的列舉起來。現在把普通人所常用的溫泉。就是鑛泉和藥泉。稍稍說明一下。</p>
<p>原來吾人的皮膚。除表皮剝脫或受傷以外。冷水和熱水。都難以自由侵入到皮膚裏面。所以浴水中。雖然含有種種的藥物。要他通過皮膚。吸收到身體裏面。是很難的一件事。研究溫泉的人。雖然講冷水和熱水。可以有幾分的侵入。但是他的分量。總是極微小而不足道。有一般的人們。過信溫泉的功效。往往不問疾病的種類。自己去洗浴。他所得到的藥物功效。雖然沒有他所希望的那樣大。但是有溫泉的地方。大多有幽秀的山水。淸潔的空氣。美麗幽靜的風景。可以賞心悅目。而且因爲每日入浴。血行的循環佳良。新陳代謝的機能旺盛。和吸入發生在礦泉的氣體。當疾病恢復期的時候。固然是很相宜。就是健康人對於保養上。也是很好的辦法。但是以爲溫泉中的各種成分。可以吸收到身體裏面發生着效力的一句話。上面已經講過。實在是過信了。</p>
<p>以上所講的是健康的人對於溫泉的情形。但是在有皮膚病的人。那就不同了。就是溫泉中所含有的種種藥物。直接接觸皮膚。可以發生治療上的效力。那是當然的事。但有一利。也有一弊。因爲沒有醫學知識的人。究竟怎樣皮膚病。適當於怎樣的溫泉。這種的判斷。實在狠難。所以爲療養的目的。去行溫泉浴。非請敎專門醫加以指導不可。因爲有幾種的皮膚病。僅僅接觸水類。有卽被刺戟。使病勢增惡的情形。而且溫泉中溫度高。同時還含着各種的藥物。能够刺戟皮膚。使病勢增惡。更爲容易。所以吾們治療皮膚病的時侯。常常過到一</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>種急性皮膚炎。他的來源。是因爲忘自進入高溫的溫泉浴所發生的結果。在腋窩股，或其他部分。發生着糜爛和表皮剝脫。同時使忠部惡化。反而受着苦痛的也不少呢。</p>
<p>鑛泉因爲他所含有的成分。有種種的區別。譬如有的含有「阿爾加里」鹽類。有的含有硫磺。有的含有食鹽，炭酸，碘，硼酸，或鐵等等。其中對於皮膚最有效力的。要算硫磺泉。但是一樣的硫磺泉。也隨着溫度和硫磺的種類有不同，例如單純的硫磺化水素泉，阿爾加里性硫磺泉，食鹽硫磺泉，以及其他種種。總之硫磺泉中的硫磺。接觸皮膚。可以變成硫化亞爾加里。能够使皮膚軟化溶解。同時對於疼痛和瘙癢。也可以鎭靜。一面還有殺菌作用。所以磺泉浴的應用。對於急性皮膚病。以少用爲安全。因他容易刺戟。反之對於頑固難治的慢性皮膚病。同時對於藥物的治療。不易奏效的時候。可以應用硫磺泉和曹達泉。也是一種的治療方法。（未完）</p>
<h3>現在松江醫藥衛生槪况</h3>
<p>— 傅積仁</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>松江（又名茸城）為舊府治，瀕黃浦江之支流，滬杭甬鐵路掠城南而過，為一大站，亦為江浙要衝之地。土壤膏膄，民物股阜，與隣近之金山，奉賢，南匯各縣，同爲產棉之區，而米及蠶絲，所產尤多。城西秀野橋河中所產之四鰓鱸，更名聞遐邇。現在交通上更有上松汽車路，由城西馬路橋起，可以直達上海南市地方廰。又有水路四通八達，故市面亦盛，尤以臨近上海，一切都市的惡劣的習慣，處處可見。惟路政不修，街道狹隘，汚穢不堪，却爲遺憾耳！</p>
<p>（二）衛生行政</p>
<p>本縣衛生行政由縣公安局第二科所辦理，卽行政科兼衛生科者。處於督察之地位，而實際工作者，則爲各區公所，其設施可分下列數端：</p>
<p>（甲）淸潔—關於淸潔方面，於城廂及各偏僻處所，設有垃圾箱。此外則派定淸道夫，每日掃除街道及傾倒垃圾等等，淸道夫由鎭公所—區之下屬部—所雇用，而由公安局督察之。（乙）衛生警察之組織—每屆夏季公安局特設立一種衛生警察，對於局中之警務則不顧問矣。專司檢査市內一切不潔之物。如街道淸潔，飲食淸潔，至茶館，戲院，公共厠所等處指導衛生設施及垃圾箱之管理。（丙）防疫—每年夏季設立臨時防疫醫院，由縣立醫院兼辦。其經費由地方上所募集者。院中免費注射防疫針，更推派醫師及護士分往各機關注射及防疫針，另備時疫病房，以收容病人，爲期三月。</p>
<p>縣民衆教育館則負宣傳之責。其方法分演講，文字及圖畫、其主點卽在指示民衆以公共衛生之常識，個人之疾病預防等。文字方面標語張貼各廣告板或墻上。至於本地小報，共有四種，對於衛生之宣傳物則均無刋載。</p>
<p>（三）醫院現狀</p>
<p>松江共有醫院四所，其名稱爲松江縣立醫院，若瑟醫院德瓊醫院，茸城醫院，茲將其詳情列后。</p>
<p>（甲）縣立醫院：由縣政府津貼每月一百二十元而開設者，院長由縣府委任。自開辦迄今，已有十七年之久，已更換院長數人，現任爲樊濟民氏，統治內外各科，附設產科，兼新法戒烟，有醫務主任一人，醫師一人，助理醫師一人，助產士一人。已往均有護土，而樊任以後，因經費困難，並無護士之聘用。院中設備簡陋，共有病房十數間，內科室一，外科室一，調劑室一，產科室二，病房分三等，雖病房甚多，然住院病人甚少，而戒烟者則較多。其中一切器械藥品等物，均爲每任院長私人帶來者，故某一院長來時，如私人之用具甚少，則此一時期內之院中設備亦少，此種情形，實甚耐人尋味也。</p>
<p>（乙）若瑟醫院：爲陸伯鴻氏私人所創辦，而託仁愛會管理，全爲敎會性質。院長卽陸氏。內有醫務主任一人，醫師二人，白頭姆姆數人，分任施診病人之診察。及配藥，管理病房等事。此院設備並不完全，病房頭·二·三等十數間，四等一大間，其他爲重病房二，消毒室一。地位寬暢，又甚幽靜，更有小花園，其因開辦年久，松人均知其名，故病人尙多。惟白頭姆姆（國人）診病，無一多大之能力，故病人常因無效而轉入他醫院者。其經費由陸氏捐募，然無基本金。</p>
<p>（丙）德瓊醫院：爲柯德瓊醫師私人設立之醫院，開辦已七年，內中設備，似較他醫院略勝一籌，現除普通設備之外，更新添電療部，應用高山太陽燈以治各種皮膚病，貧血症，虛弱，瘰癧，骨癆等症；熱光燈以治中外耳炎，麻巴腺炎，神經病等。其自設之配藥部藥品，亦較他院爲多。甚至有人向藥房中配藥時介紹至院配取，此又一趣事也，院內設病房五間。更附設保產醫院，有醫師一人，助產士二人，學生二人，乃兼任護士之性質。</p>
<p>（丁）葺城醫院：爲張紹修醫師私人所倡辦，方由去年十一月開幕，設備尙佳，病房數間，設有太陽燈，顯微鏡等，亦附設產科。有醫師一人，助產士二人，（兼任護士工作）學生一人，充護士。院址臨上松汽車路旁，鬧中取靜，適於養病，故病人亦不少。</p>
<p>（四）私人診所之現狀</p>
<p>松地共有新醫十餘位，雖亦有數位稱診所爲醫院者，然余因其並不合醫院之設備，旣無病房，又無護士，故均併入此節矣，此一現象，與余去歲夏季在鎭海任職時以見者相同。</p>
<p>本地人民，對於新醫之信仰，不若敬重舊醫之甚。卽以新醫之人數言，亦不若舊醫之多矣。一班病人，先經舊醫診治，如未見效，方投入新醫之懷。其爲外科病者，初以中藥店之膏藥敷之，或至舊醫外科處診治，然大多未能痊愈者，待化膿　瘍甚烈時方轉至新醫處求治。余在院中所見之外科皮膚科病人均若是。故對治療之時間上較初發者爲長久矣。總之，因人民智識簡淺，對於新醫之認識甚淺；卽有一班智識界人，亦多喜請舊醫診治，何怪無知者乎？加以松地之新醫人數甚少，又無設備完全之大醫院，不能有較優之供獻，亦爲一大原因也，除非各醫師所熟之外，均爲病人稀少也，其中有數人爲兼校醫，或各機關之醫務者。（未完）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十四）脚氣病（Beriberi）（三）</p>
<p>問　脚氣病人的血管，有無變化？</p>
<p>答　末梢血管，大都緊張力減退，可以聽取血管音問有所謂衝心脚氣病的，到底是怎麼樣的情形？答　這就是一種急性惡性的脚氣病，年輕的人發生最多。有的從輕型或浮腫型轉移到衝心脚氣病的；也有突然以惡寒戰慄發執而急劇發病的。</p>
<p>問　衝心脚氣的病狀怎樣答　發衝心脚氣病的時候，病人心悸亢進，胸部窘迫，心窩苦悶，呼吸促迫，呈非常不穩情形。伸吟於床上，輾轉反側。口渴劇甚，或發惡心嘔吐和吃逆。</p>
<p>問　這時候在客觀的方面，有什麼症像？</p>
<p>答　客觀的心臟濁音擴大，現收縮期雜音，第二肺動脈音亢進，見心臟和心窩部的搏動。脈搏頻數軟弱，呼吸急促，屎量减少，肝臟腫大，血壓低降。</p>
<p>問　衝心脚氣，是不是非常危險的？</p>
<p>答　是很危險的，大槪經過一二天後，皮膚乾燥，起靑藍色，心臟麻痺，因而致死。</p>
<p>問　衝心脚氣，有無救治的機會？</p>
<p>答　若能早期充分治療，可免致命。</p>
<p>問　患脚氣病的病人，一定有浮腫的嗎？</p>
<p>答　大多數的脚氣病人，現有浮腫；但程度有些輕重罷了。發浮腫的部分，最初在下腿，尤其是內外踝，和足背脛骨稜等處。若病勢增惡，逐漸波及到全下肢，面部，軀幹和上肢。高度的竟有在體內各腔潴成水腫。</p>
<p>問　脚氣病浮腫生成的原因，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答　因爲組織細胞和毛管內皮細胞都起變化致水分蓄積於組織內的綠故。此外還有因爲心臟或腎臟變化的關係而起浮腫的。</p>
<p>問　脚氣病人的尿，有什麽變化？</p>
<p>答　病人尿量减少；重病的時侯，每天排洩，祇不到一百立方糎。竟有起尿閉的。等到病狀輕快，尿量就很增加。尿中成分，含有蛋白質，有圓柱體發見。</p>
<p>問　腎臟的變化怎樣？</p>
<p>答　腎臟機能，在病勢還輕的時侯，沒有多大的障礙。可是中等度和重症的脚氣病人，水分和食鹽的排出困難。但蛋白質之類的排洩却仍良好。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十八）近視眼（續）</p>
<p>近視眼的痛苦　近視眼的痛苦。乃人人所知道的。就是凡遠距離的物像。都不能明瞭視察。所以在讀書寫字的時候。眼球常須接近書本。敎室內聽講的時候。屢感黑板上的字體。糢糊難辨。無論在戲館或電影院的時侯。均須選坐前數排。方稱滿意。但是這等痛苦。不難由矯正眼鏡的輔助而解除的。近視眼的預防法講到近視眼的預防法。就是注重眼球的衛生法。亦卽是排除促成近視眼各種誘因的方法。茲特分述如左。若能逐條實行。就是在已有近視的人。亦當可阻止她的進行。　　（一）讀書寫字的時候。眼與書本的距離。最好是在三十生的米突。光綫最好採取由左方射來的光綫。頭部不可前屈。</p>
<p>（二）强光烈日的照射下及雪地與水面的反光下。均不宜於讀書寫字。</p>
<p>（三）在黃昏的時候。或弱光黑暗的地方。讀書工作。都不相宜。因爲易使眼球疲勞。</p>
<p>（四）夜間工作的時候。若用蠟燭或火油燈。則因燈火的動搖。或光度的變化。常可損目。</p>
<p>（五）書籍的文字。應當採用顯明而大的字體。因久閱細小的字體。最易誘成近視（學生由日久翻用細小英文字典而變爲近視的很多）。</p>
<p>（六）在不能維持眼與物體一定的距離。像仰臥，乘車，步行等時候。切不可閱書。因爲物像時時移動。距離又無規定。所以眼球最易疲勞。</p>
<p>（七）不可有近看物體的習慣。因可惹起水晶體的凸出及眼軸的延長。而致促成近視。</p>
<p>（八）久用視力後。務須給與適當的休養。以免眼部的充血。而節眼球的勞力。</p>
<p>（九）酒類能害視神經。减衰視力。少飲爲佳。睡眠不足。亦可傷眼。避之爲宜。</p>
<p>（十）光綫不足或閃動劇烈的影片。不可看近視眼的矯正法如果已經成爲近視眼。當然要用矯正法。所謂矯正法者無他。就是配用適宜的凹鏡。用以輔助水晶體的屈折力。如是可使由水晶體屈折而來的物像。完全映在網膜的上面。此時眼球亦卽變爲具有健全正視眼的機能。可以明瞭視物。不過這種凹鏡的配置前。須經眼科醫師詳細檢査眼內各部的情形。方爲妥當。否則凹度（就是深淺）若不適當。則視力更將受害。不可不愼。同時須注意上面所講的十條眼球的衛生法。勿謂已有眼鏡輔助。棄而不顧啊。</p>
<h3>五洲藥方之「衛生指南」</h3>
<p>— 閻絲儒</p>
<p>人生之需要，衣食住行而外，不能無醫藥之備。世界開明，物質薪其精良，而尤求便捷；吾國醫藥墨守舊章，少於研究，臨病取服，效力迂緩！煮炙煩費！無可諱言。至平時旅行之携帶，家庭之貯備，更缺如焉。五洲藥房出版「衞生指南」一書，係彙集該藥房各種出品，編訂而成，內容分門別類，詳載功有服法，凡窮鄉僻壤不易求醫之病家，逕按煩檢查，對症購報，不致歧誤。該書近於編印第五版時，特由汪于岡醫士加以革新，並將各藥所含成分，印入書內，使能增益指導健康治療疾苦之效力，意至善也。茲將余雲岫醫師爲該書所作用之序文，摘錄如後：</p>
<p>「上海五洲大藥房，爲我國新藥先路之導，華路藍縷，以啓草昧，三十有四年於茲矣。方時國人之於新藥，耳未聞而目未見，遑論其用乎！少所見，多所怪，將必有按夜光而按劍者；於是本其配製之品，一一爲之講明，引據醫理，明述病候，次及藥用，粲然備矣；製品旣多，爲說遂廣，彙而成帙，題曰衛生指南；蓋居然旅舍備要之方，病機保命之集矣。醫學日新，而是書亦每有更改，蓋隨醫學之演進，而與時偕行也；今復假手汪君于岡，增損竄改；汪君，余之同學，進德修業，學邃而思精，又余之畏友也。其革新是書，大旨已自述於弁言之中，要而言之，乘時勢而用科學也。嗟乎！茫茫神州，國日蹙而民日弊，深求其故，則不識時務，輕視科學，有以致之也。挾四千年傳統智識，高言往古，漫然自大，深閉固拒，以斥進化之績，是猶狃於蒙皮茹毛之俗，而不順神農熱食之敎，黃帝衣裳之治也。崇飾處玄，玩愒歲月，樂莊老剖斗折衡之論，訾儒法聽言責事之訓，是以民情日蕩，事物不功，豈謂制校眞可以撻堅甲利兵，而鑿隧抱甕爲足以傲梏橰耶？退處僿野，以自儕於菲洲土人，台灣生蕃之伍，國如之何不削且亡耶！夫風氣之轉移，醫藥有其先導，我神州華冑當炎黃之時，文明肇啟，而卽有醫藥之萌生，是其一證也；故余謂醫藥之進化與否，可以爲國家與亡人民文野之兆朕，上之徵於古，近之騐於今，蓋神於著龜而信於符瑞矣。國人之言科學救國，亦有年矣，而於醫藥則未有所見！余每以爲憂，是以目舊醫誕妄之論，方之禹之洪水，益之猛獸，盡力排除，以啟國人；以為此而不能省悟，即無乘時勢之智，用科學之勇，而國族將終於淪䘮矣！今則國醫館整理舊學之綱，以科為方式矣；極而返思；吾炎黄子孫，或可免作鞭打之奴乎；而五洲之書，亦適於是時作進一步之倡導，以新社會之耳目；然則是書之革新，豈特於民衆衛生收指南之益哉！其於轉移時勢之役，亦與有力焉，可謂能盡其先導之責者矣。書旣成，五洲總經理項君繩武屬序於余，亟書所感以歸之。」</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學　（六）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>還有一種瘡與胃瘡有不可分離的關係卽十二指腸接連胃下端的部分的瘡呌做十二指腸瘡。原因病狀與胃瘡相同其不相同處卽十二指腸瘡痛，肚子餓了痛，一直等到下頓吃過飯才不痛，飯消化了又痛起來了，不痛的時間只有吃過飯後的一兩小時。病者吃激刺的食物疼痛加甚，吃淡味食物疼痛减輕。常看見患這種病的被疼痛纏綿歷十年二十年不愈</p>
<p>這種病旣是如此普徧又如此纏綿我想北這一部分疼痛的方法一定是很值得我們研究的。現在先講講不正當的止痛方法。普通的止痛藥片或藥粉是無用的。意志薄弱的很容易成鴉片毒品的奴隸。比方，一個人有胃痛他遇見一位吸鴉片的朋友，他的朋友講請吸一口烟。他吸了一次隨時胃痛就停止了。如此一次，二次，多次，鴉片就成了癮，一次再不吸鴉片胃痛就再發，久而久之這個人就完全成了鴉片的奴隸。現在略談談鴉片嗎啡如何可止這種痛。我們曉得胃瘡痛是胃瘡受胃內的酸或粗食物激刺。胃瘡處的神經接觸器就將激刺消息傳到大腦當中的司痛神經，這個人就覺到胃痛。吃鴉片與打嗎啡針的作用是怎樣呢？鴉片嗎啡同是麻醉品。其作用爲鴉片吸到肺內再被吸到血內，由血到大腦司痛神經。司痛神經細胞被麻醉了便失落了知覺，胃痛的感覺雖照樣傳到大腦，，但大腦却已成了麻木不仁，如此痛覺沒有了。其實並沒有止住胃痛也沒有醫好胃瘡。並且因爲麻醉的作用，病者吃激刺性與粗食物使胃瘡受傷更多，瘡口越變越大病者也不自知。如果沒有麻醉作用不合宜食物使胃痛加甚病者决不能吃胃瘡也不致漸大。由此可見鴉片毒品止胃痛不是正當方法。謹告有胃病的朋友們千萬不要上麻醉品的當。</p>
<p>有人問到底什麼是正當止胃痛的方法？用科學醫學的方法來止胃痛就是正當的方法。茲述新止痛之綱要於下：第一，是要去掉生胃瘡的原因。第二，减少身心的勞動使胃可以休息一部分。第三，是合宜的飲食。合宜的飲食是：（一）食物到胃內不激刺胃。（二）食物可以减低胃酸。（三）食物不使胃多生消化汁。（四）滋養料充足使病人抵抗力加高致胃瘡可以長好。</p>
<p>不激刺冑與减低胃酸的食物如牛奶，奶油，豆腐漿，蛋靑，藕粉湯，麵湯，米湯，爛煮稀粥等。這些食物進到胃內不激刺胃故胃也不多生胃酸。胃酸生的多胃痛也加甚，胃酸生的少胃痛也减輕。胃痛重的，起初飲食祇當限於以上食物或與相同之食物。數星期後飲食種類可漸加增以下食物：麵包，熟煮菜心，菜葉等。（未完）</p>

<h3>粘性</h3>
<p>— 胡洛</p>
<p>罔先生在「悒鬱」中這樣寫：他們懂得世界正在向那一個方向向轉動，他們也看到橫在他們自身的前路上的危機……可是，他們身上的壞的特徵和他們的生活在里面的壞的氛圍限制了他們，他沒有勇氣和毅力向前跨一步。』因此，他們「悒鬰」了。是的，這是這變動的社會中必然的產物。</p>
<p>正因爲他們在社會中是懸空地生活着，所以才養成他們這一種游疑不决，瞻前顧後的毛病。眼見着社會是朝前滾動了，也明知道這時代的浪潮會無情地冲瀉過去；然而，他們缺乏勇氣，他們留戀着舊巢，他們也做着奇奇怪怪的夢，夢見他們旁觀在岸旁，看着江水從跟前滾過去。但是，現實畢竟不同於夢想，他們也感到旁觀是不可能的，因此，他們更「悒鬱」了，頹廢了。</p>
<p>這便說明了「粘性」作用。一個蒼蠅爲紙上的膠粘住，便逃不掉了。膠的作用便是把蒼蠅與紙緊緊地粘起來。在現社會中，懸空生活的人也是如此。舊的思想，習慣……都像膠一般地把他們緊緊地粘起來。當他們覺悟到膠是可憎惡的時候，但膠還依然地粘住他們。一方面他想脫離這被膠着了的紙，但另一方面，膠的力量又使他對於舊的紙發生了相出的留戀。由於這個「矛盾」，他們便「悒鬱」了，苦痛了。</p>
<p>但人絕不能跟蒼蠅來比較的。因爲蒼蠅被膠住後，便只有死亡。人戚到了危機時，便時刻地想起脫這危機。然而，這世上，人正像「逆水行舟」，不進則只有退。能够永遠懸掛在社會中的人，似乎是不可能的。若是你不爬起來追上去，你便會被時代的浪冲毀掉。因此，中間的人只有努力打脫這粘性的東西，追上前去！</p>
<p>脫離「粘性」與「悒鬱」，並不是不可能的。但是，要想站在旁觀的地位來脫離這粘性物時，不但脫離不了，還怕愈脫離愈「悒鬱」吧。粘性的脫離，絕不是嘴裏唱唱便可能的，而是應該在生活的洪爐中煆煉成功的。自己不參加到生活裏去，而夢想着脫離「悒鬱」，這恐怕只有在夢中才有實現的可能。可是，美麗的夢一碰着現實時，便粉碎了。</p>
<p>「粘性」只有讓生活的焰火來燒乾掉，否則，粘性的東西還是緊緊地粘住你，你也只有不斷地「悒鬱」着，直到毀滅的時那一天。</p>
<h3>他們又這樣地挨過了一天</h3>
<p>— 已而</p>
<p>失業後的若，近來越發困窮了！工作曾四面懇托熱人代尋，却至今連一點綫索也沒有。當是當盡了幾樣值錢的物件，早就放入典質舖裏去了。賒也賒够了，不用現銀交易，店舖裏是冉也不肯拿東西賣給你了。借？在異鄉客地，要向那裏去告急？親戚是沒有的。三兩個算得起是知己的朋友，有的給自己牽累得重了，怎好意思再開口？有的已回故鄉去，也不在上海了。還有的呢？正和自己一樣窮，自顧還不暇，那有餘力冉救別人？故幾個月來，他們倆雖然克苦克儉，忍饑挨凍，總免不了要陷於山窮水盡的絕境，給生活壓迫得透不過氣！</p>
<p>今天眼見飯又接不着午膳了。下午三點鐘的光景，若突然地從書桌前跳了起來，把身上穿着的一套僅有的舊西裝脫下來，　報紙裹好，再披上了一件布長衫，報紙包挾着，　　促地開着房門，走下樓去了。臨行的當兒，一聲不響。就運躺、床上的影問他「往那裏去」？他　好像沒有聽見似的，只顧自去了。</p>
<p>走入附近的一家當舖，若就把挾着的紙包，從高櫃臺的鐵柵窗口遞了進去，自己便站在外面，伸仰曰着頭，靜靜地等候着裏面的消息。</p>
<p>「西裝不當」，散亂了的紙包，給推出來了。</p>
<p>跑進第二家。</p>
<p>當舖裏的夥計打開一看：「不要！太破舊了！」</p>
<p>這時，若有點心慌了，但並不絕望。就一直走到售交易的那一家去。</p>
<p>紙包照例送上去。</p>
<p>「連這種東西也拿來」？夥計看也不看，便把紙包用力推出來。</p>
<p>「一塊錢好了，帮帮忙吧，三兩日就贖！」他哀求似的說</p>
<p>「贖？那個希罕你贖？快拿出去！去，去！」夥計得意地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>若知道沒有法于再商量了，便把紙包重新裹好，挾在腋下，垂着頭，走出了大門。這時站在鐵棚外的幾個衣衫襤褸的工人，不约而同的齊向他投了一個目光—同情似的目光。</p>
<p>在回家的途上，他不覺心裏感到了一陣哀愁，便自言自語道：一窮人是做不得的呀！」他又想：「當舖裏的夥計，態度實在够傲慢！這一襲西裝，誠然太破舊了，沒有人要。然難道運一塊錢也值不得？就說不當，不當也吧了，又何必這樣福氣迫人呢！」正在胡思亂想間，背後忽然跟來了一個小叫化，頻頻向着他哀求作排，伸着手乞錢。他一瞥眼看着這個孩子很可憐，就索性把褲袋裏僅存的六個銅板擲給他。頭也不回，再轉個彎，又大踏步走了。</p>
<h3>物役</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>更聲</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>以前住在熱鬧的市區裏，在囂應擾攘，身心疲散的狀態中，竟連東京有打更的這回事也不知道。這回搬了家，地方彷彿類鄉間的小鎭；每屆午夜，便有一種熟耳的更聲，由遠而近，由近而遠，衝破了死般的沉寂。人是不甘寂寞的，正像飛蛾的不甘黑暗一樣。在世界上的一切都彷彿死滅了的黑夜，在　溜單調地滴着化水的雪夜，這更聲，這更聲充滿着百折不撓的意志，充滿着飽經閱歷的情感，嚴肅地，健穩地，迫近我走來了。這時候，好像傳說中進謁耶路撒冷聖地的信者似的，我摒息着，讓整個的心靈在興奮和狂樂中波動：更聲掀起我腦海裏洶涌的思想之波，半嚮，便隠約地消逝了。</p>
<p>家鄕的更聲是一種笨拙的鼓聲，沒有留給我一點親切之感；值得懷戀的，還是故都的更聲。故都的更聲雖然蒼老而古板，沒有現在所聽的帶着靑春氣的堅亮，然而牠們都有着堅决的意志和莊重的感情。那時我和光，加三人，住在一所僻陋的院房裏，北方特產的朔風，吹得故都特有的窗屏薄紙慄慄作顫。從陰濕的地皮裏冒出來的冷氣，一陣陣地，透過了坍破的布床上的草毯，滲進人的飢膚。在不斷的戰顫中那熟悉的更聲來了，堅决而健穩。只有在這一瞬間，我忘記了寒冷，忍住了戰顫，讓悸動的心兒追隨在更聲的背後。除了地獄裏的苦囚聽到人聲時的喜悅和與奮，再沒有別的可以來形容我那時的心情了。</p>
<p>人間的變幻是迅速的。目從自己不自量地離開母胎，佔了人間的一席以來，二十一年中，所見的變幻眞無從淸數。許多人從慷慨激昂，變到腐化墮落，許多人則像現在的光似的陷在殘酷的黑暗裏，或像加，正在貧苦夾攻的生路上掙扎。聽過同一更聲的人們轉瞬間便起了這樣的變動！唯有這堅穩的更聲，一樣地在黑暗裏響着，響着。</p>
<p>只要是厭惡黑暗的人，大抵沒有不喜歡更聲的；這聲音在黑夜中暗示給我們以熱力，而且，在聽完了最後的更聲時，鮮暖的陽光便會親切地撫捫着我們憔悴的臉龐了。</p>
<h3>活字與死字（二）</h3>
<p>— 陳友琹</p>
<p>在並未復古亦未變今的現在，我們爲通俗起見，不能不「吾從衆」。现在有甲乙丙三生於此，共作一題，甲的文章中，有「他財十五歲」。乙的文章中，有「他裁十五歲」，丙的文章中，有「他才十五歲」的句子。「財」·「裁」·「才」·三字，都可以與「纔」字通，漢書上財裁都作初字解，本來沒有一個是錯字，然而我所取的是丙生。只不過因爲丙生所用的「才」字，在現在社會上與纔字一般通用，是活字，「財」與「裁」都已成爲死字了。自然財與裁，在「發財」「裁縫」的用途上，又是活字了。</p>
<p>再說「申」字本爲古文之電字，自字本爲古文之鼻字，朋字本爲古文之鳳字，母字本爲古文之貫字，七字本爲古文之化字，西字本爲古文之棲字。照說，申·云·自·朋·母七·西，筆盡都較後起的電鼻等字簡單，我們似乎可以「中」代「電」，以「自」代「鼻」，以「朋」代「鳳」了，然而平常通用的時候，「打電報」决不可以寫作「打申報」；（申報館要誤會的一笑！）「他的鼻子紅了」，决不可以寫作「他的自子紅了」；「遊龍戲鳳」，也不可以寫作「遊龍戲朋」，何以故？申是電的死字，自是鼻的死字，朋是鳳的死字而已！其他若前後之前，本宜作歬，說文，歬，不行而進也。前本爲剪字，並無進意，然而前字通用而歬字反不用，歬便成爲死字了。</p>
<p>曹先生曾經笑我說：「分歧笑分岐，叔重要氣煞」（平常我們在校中的打油詩）。不知作分歧者，歧是活字：作分岐者，岐是死字其中有死活之分也。當時我回答他的打油詩其中也有二句云：「當心瞢也誤成曹，誰知陳陣原同字」，便是因爲「臨陣」之陣，大衆都已作「陣」，不復如古畫上作「臨陳」也。</p>
<p>試問現在寫別字的人，有幾個像曹先生一樣能知其別之所以爲別呢？不知其別之以爲別。是錯也，非別也。敎者將錯就錯，學者以訛傳訛，勢必誤盡後學不止。（敎錯字，是誤人的學業；敎別字，也是誤人的光陰）。</p>
<h3>第一次家信</h3>
<p>— 萬凝思</p>
<p>想，</p>
<p>又想；</p>
<p>怎樣落筆呢！</p>
<p>說這高高的牆？</p>
<p>說這陰濕的監房，</p>
<p>說每天兩碗黃飯</p>
<p>兩盞混湯，</p>
<p>還不够塡半支飢腸？</p>
<p>蘸飽了墨，</p>
<p>又蘸飽了墨；</p>
<p>怎樣落筆呢？</p>
<p>寫那看守們的一臉橫肉？</p>
<p>寫自己被鐐銬的手足？</p>
<p>寫被鞭撻到血肉糢糊</p>
<p>還有那老虎橙底殘酷？</p>
<p>愁着時間的短促，</p>
<p>終於下筆了：</p>
<p>「娘啊，</p>
<p>想作兒仍在唸書，</p>
<p>不要惦念吧！</p>
<p>獄中長長的日子，</p>
<p>都是平安的呢！」</p>
<h3>戰爭雜記（四）</h3>
<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>母親每天都去担「剩飯」。小個子的姑母在屋簷下面舖着蓆子幹着削筷子的副業。我跟姐姐在散學之後也帮着削。我頂討厭這種「削筷子」的事情。用小刀子小心地削那劈得很細的竹片，簡直把人悶得沒有辦法。我只是玩弄那始終擱在懷中的玩具，一有空馬上就跑了出去。</p>
<p>我們的遊戲，以打仗爲頂盛行，毆門得頗厲害。有月亮的夜晚，許多的小孩子就先行議定，以村尾土地廟做中心，互相搶奪着「陣地」。</p>
<p>我的氣力很强大；但，欠靈敏，所以，頭上常常弄起瘤子跑回家裏來。</p>
<p>那時候，繪着戰爭的光景和大將，中將肖像的玩具非常流行。我之記牢黑木大將和大山，野津，乃木，瓜生海軍中將等等的肖像和名字，也是在那個時候。</p>
<p>賣號外的不時在慌亂的鈴聲中跑來。一聽所鈴聲，姑母和母親雖然自己看不懂，但也走神走色，狼狽地把它買來。我時常光着脚跟着賣號外的屁股跑。</p>
<p>「嬴了，赢了，打下九連城。」</p>
<p>想來是在奉天城陷落的很久以前，當打下了九連城的時候，村民都爲之狂喜。我們在「攻取陣地」得勝時，也一定會嚷着「贏了，贏了，打下九連城」，而拍手，跳舞。</p>
<p>在村中土地廟的大樟樹頂上，揭起了巨大的國旗。村裏的「上樹的阿甚哥」下了最大的决心，爬到危險的頂上去，把那大旗掛了起來。那好像是爲着祈禱—一保佑打仗勝利，村裏頭的出征軍人都平安地凱旋！」—而掛起來的。</p>
<p>但，戰死的報告，却頻繁地接踵而來。</p>
<p>「阿貞陣亡了！」</p>
<p>一天傍晚，外祖父握着有紅條紋的電報，從我家的簽頭那邊嗚嗚地哭着跑了進來。</p>
<p>聽到了親屬以外的人們戰死的報告並沒有那樣戰戰兢兢的母親她們，自從貞助陣亡以後，就好像在脚底下突然裂了口一般地，無時無刻不是提心吊膽的。</p>
<p>貞助雖然死了；但並沒舉行葬儀。連頭髮也沒有送來，無法殯葬。在那兒子已經夭折，僅存一綫希望的孫兒又戰死了的祖父家裏，好像是怪寂寞的。</p>
<p>我非常憎恨俄國鬼。</p>
<p>房東的大兒子彌一哥也來了戰死的報告。不時有軍事郵信從我的父親那邊寄來；但，姑丈的方面，却突然不來了。</p>
<p>母親和姑母每晚都念着佛，為姑太丈他們全生的運命而祈禱。有時，當我就寢以後，母親她們就跟　瘋人一般地，一壁敲着太平鼓，一壁發出很大的聲音念着：「南無妙法蓮華經，南無妙法蓮華經。」一直要念到很晚，使我在睡夢中都仿佛聽得到。</p>
<p>我不由的有些害怕起戰爭來了。我不由的湧起了想要跟父親想會的希望。</p>
<p>奉天城給打下夾了。</p>
<p>我已經記不到那是什麽月日，我只記得：那天自己趕着賣號外的走去買報，正是個炎熱的夏日；是個太陽照射得很厲害，路上的沙子都好像要焚燒脚底（我們小孩子大抵都是赤着脚過日子的）般的，陽光最猛烈的時刻。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談讀古書</h3>
<p>— 巴山</p>
<p>近來有人在提倡讀古書，慚愧得很，天姿魯鈍的我，一聽就發抖。以過去的經騐說來，提倡讀古書說說亦無妨，如果認眞要讀起來，恐怕就連提倡的人亦要頭痛。秦始皇焚書不過燒些「反動」的書，還有「正動」的書存在，到了楚覇王放了一把火，古書一乾二淨以後，漢朝伏生口授經籍，是不是「原封不動」的正貨那還不去管他，可是，古書已經留傳不多，這是歷史上的事實誰都不能否認的吧？漢朝人寫作偽古書最多，今已經知偽者外，不知還有多少偽古書在騙後人·這也是誰都不能否認的吧？就是漢人所作的近古書籍，傳鈔錯誤，留傳至今，使人讓不順看不懂的文章，也是不知還有多少，這總也是誰都不能否認的吧？漢朝人治學，公羊穀梁派與左傳派的今文古文之爭，至今還是各傳「師承」地互爭短長迄未解决，使後人不知如何適從，這恐怕也是誰都不能否認的吧？</p>
<p>辨偽旣已困難，讀書亦不容易。前人讀書，先通小學，小學是什麼呢？就是識字，辨音，訓詁之道。識字要研究「說文，」辨音要研究音韻，訓詁要先讀「爾雅，」光這識字，辨音，訓詁三種工作，已經便是半世的學問。何况，還有金石文甲骨文的研究呢？</p>
<p>研究古書，留傳古代文化，這是發掘遺產的工作，專門學者孜孜不倦，終身努力，這是國家應該獎勵的事，如果要學生門都鑽進舊紙堆裏去，那是大有問題。第一要有敎得好敎得通的先生，第二便是在學校的幾個年頭轉眼便過，時間亦不允許了。</p>
<p>現在敎古書敎得好敎得通的先生能有多少，呌學生們如何讀下去呢？</p>
<h3>崔護</h3>
<p>— 新綠</p>
<p>店開元四年三月十四日。</p>
<p>那天是淸明節，詩社裏爲了欣賞佳節起見，特開起個盛大的宴會，地點是借溫飛卿的家裏，到的人很多，酒過半酣大家暢談起來，坐在他旁邊的李商隱，是個出名的捉狹鬼，忽然瞇花了眼睛，拍拍他的肩膀：</p>
<p>「啊老崔，你今年已是整整三十歲；應趕快娶位嫂夫人總是，切莫錯過了春光。」</p>
<p>「可不是麽？崔先生爲什麽老是不請我們喝喜酒呀？」另一個說：</p>
<p>「哈」！</p>
<p>「哈」！</p>
<p>這時，崔護心裏威到異常的難堪：臉孔發燒，心想老李不應該有意在大庭廣衆間嘲笑他，憤恨起來，酒也不喝了，鐵青了臉立起身來往外就走，聽憑許</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>多人喚他，他推說頭痛，死命也不肯進去。</p>
<p>他醉熏熏地走出來，看看天氣太好，不願意就回家去，便順着脚步望珞珈山走來，一路上和風噓拂，粉蝶見飛去飛來，柳條兒迎着笑，精神陡爲之一爽</p>
<p>珞珈山本離城東不遠，大道直達，那天他漫不經意轉了幾個彎，却弄錯了路徑；</p>
<p>看看天色將暮，烏鴉亂飛，尙望不見珞珈山的影子，脚到累得有此酸疲了。不由得焦燥起來，心裏打算：今天非借問一聲恐怕要迷途了！跨過石板橋，遙見殷紅的桃叢中，一個小小的村塢，他走將前去，祇有村屋三兩，外面一幅稻塲，倒很寬廣，幾隻鷄鴨，在喙那殘餘的稻壳，炊烟起處，縷縷上升，點輟了這大千靄色；望望四圍，了無人跡，他在臨近左首的村屋門上輕輕敲了兩下，門呀的開了，出來的是位風致嫣然的村姑。</p>
<p>「眞對不起！我是迷路的，請問到珞珈山怎樣走？」</p>
<p>「從這裏向北，越過香蓮溪就到了，啊，大爺，不過現在天已垂晚，你趕到那裏恐怕已來不及了。」</p>
<p>「哦！……」面對這純樸秀美的村姑，耳聽這瀝瀝如珠的軟語，崔護心裏有一個遐想。</p>
<p>「大爺！我想你趕路已很疲乏，如不嫌骯髒，請進來打歇打歇，我的爸爸頂喜歡讀書人呢」。</p>
<p>「姑娘，謝謝你！天色不早，我也要回去了，倘能賜一盂淸泉解渴，倒感激不監！」</p>
<p>當他喝水的時候，那村姑斜倚在門邊，不走也不嚮，祇望着他徵笑，兩個酒渦浮在她的臉上，宛如一對海棠蕚。</p>
<p>「天啊，多美的姑娘」！他禁不住動蕩起來，很願意多逗留一會兒，好多飽餐些秀色，可是水終於喝完了，無可奈何地把那只空盂見交給了她：</p>
<p>「謝謝」！</p>
<p>門碰的關上，他失了魂靈似地踽踽踱回來，從那天起，由於思念那村姑的太厲害，他竟然懨懨病了！然而他到底不好意思說將出來，就這樣地纏綿牀褥，幾乎整整一年，上月纔慢慢好將起來，今天又值淸明，他換了一襲輕凉的雁翎氅，興冲冲地趕到舊地來，企圖重復見到他念念不忘的心上人兒。</p>
<p>懷了一種像金履故鄉的心情，進了那小村落，桃花仍鮮艷地盛開着，鷄鴨仍落寞的靜步着，但她家的門却深深地反扃上了。</p>
<p>「啊！啊！」，這誠然要使他哀傷起來，她家到那裏去了呢？是搬走他鄉麼？是探親未歸麼？……希望之花萎落了！熱情之夢敲碎了！剩下來的祇是惹人心痛的三兩空屋，惱人愁緒的片片浮雲　。</p>
<p>柳條兒輕擺，桃花兒含笑。</p>
<p>經過了向鄰家詳盡的探問，得到的仍舊不知究竟的時候，他慢悵地向人家借了一枝筆，醮濃了墨，在她家的門上寫了這樣的四句：</p>
<p>「去年今日此門中，人面桃花相映紅；</p>
<p>人面不知何處去？桃花依舊笑春風！」</p>
<h3>「油漆未乾」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>油漆未乾一劇雖是以喜劇的塲面演出，但實質上却是以悲劇爲核心的。全劇共分三幕。第一幕是叙述哈致醫生家裏從前住居着的一個窮畫家，死後十年的現在他的畫忽然值錢起來了，於是來了一個畫商，花言巧語騙走了兩幅畫；第二幕，當代的名批評家收藏家以及書商都羣集到哈致的家裏，各願以巨金購買那窮畫家的畫，但所存着的畫統治妻子燒掉了。祇勝下頂值的女僕關妮的畫像，於是醫生用盡心計從女僕手裏搶過來，想賣掉發財；第三幕女僕臨走之時無意說出了她還保留着就是妻子呌他燒掉的，十七張畫。醫生聽着幾乎驚喜欲狂，全家的人亦歡呼高呌，不料關妮又說出她已與窮畫家生前訂了婚，並取出一隻戒指做瞪，遺產是屬於妻子的，晴天霹靂，醫生的黃金夢粉碎了。關妮帶了所有的畫去了，醫生一家大大哭起來。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>無疑地，這劇的本事是超現實的理想派的作品，並沒有怎樣包括多分的眞實性，至如導演者歐陽予倩所謂這個劇對於現社會有相當意義，它直接諷刺哈致那種人，簡接諷刺支持這種人的制度。我看並不盡然，在這資本主義社會與社會主義社會相鬥爭的達於頂點非常時代，用那麼一些糊糢的意識的劇本來表現是不够的，所以說諷刺現社會制度的話，實在未免牽强誇張。至於諷刺哈致醫生那類人物倒是可以的，因爲留停在急激的時代裏許多小有產階級都有感到沒落的悲哀，而這沒落的命運是無法挽救的，但他們一面又掙扎着，同時灰色感的思想就佈備了腦裏。醫生哈致便是這種典型代表，從其家庭生活上表現得淸楚、他方面愈想維持紳士身份的假面具，就一愈揭發出可憐的色相來。其他如掛羊頭賣狗肉而其實是俗物之流的所謂批評家，虛偽奸詐的商賈，這些小丑式的人物的確是充滿了現社會裏頭。在劇中都一個個給他們露骨的無情的刺諷和解剖。所以說攻擊哈致這種人是可以使人同戚的。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>因爲是喜劇，所以每個塲面都是籠罩着濃厚的有趣的氣氛，處處諧詼百出，令人忍俊不住，整個情節的聯檕十分緊凑，劇情的發展亦很協調，由淡入濃，愈至高度則情緒愈緊張，所以觀衆差不多是全用着狂笑的痛快的無休止的心情一直繼續到完幕的。不過在看完了之後，我却有種相反的戚想，覺得哈致的思想和行徑的表現，使人想到一個屬於沒落層的老年人的怯弱無能的可憐又可笑，是使人會對其發生憎惡的。</p>
<p>人物的支配尙協調，但有一個缺點却不可忽視，便是這劇該是以女僕關妮作爲中心進程的綫索的，可是結果反變成以醫生爲焦點，關妮的人生身世個性等便模糊了。</p>
<p>演員都很賣力，飾醫生的舒湮做得頗沉練，祗是第一慕出塲時較爲差點，以後大致是可滿意的。飾太太的李麗蓮面臉的表情甚逼眞動人，不過偶爾之間有些地方太過裝扮。而尤其是她表現一個中等家庭的婦人所特有的氣質來得更深入，飾女傼的王瑩也不錯，惟發言時的態度稍微過火，而且着了一雙時髦高跟鞋出塲，走路時風韻飄然，却是不合事理的，這應該歸之於監督者的疏忽。其他的演員無什可說，璐璐最壤。做戲的經騐是不够的。</p>

<p>我們沒有家。生活的巨掌，把我們從農村趕到都市；正像氣候的變移，趕着燕子似的。</p>
<p>被機器吸乾了血，從工廠裏拋擲出來，像一根無肉的骨頭沒人憐惜，我們之中有着這樣無依的老人；天災人禍吃了他們的父母，沒人養育，沒人管敎，聽憑着風霜雨露的侵蝕，我們之中有着這樣流浪的孩子。我們的數目是龐大的</p>
<p>煤屑堆上，有我們快樂的天堂。</p>
<p>從春到夏，從秋到冬，我們無日不在挖掘着。用那麽一張小小的窄窄的鐵片，挖掘着堅結的煤屑，子細地搜尋着硬的石子，鬆的泥塊，多稜的碎磚，總混不過我們所要找尋的東西，憑着那上面星星的微光，我們可以辨認出卽使比黃豆還小的顆粒。</p>
<p>媒灰從我們的手上爬到我們的鼻上牠塗黑了我們的面龐，也塗黑了我們的生活。然而我們沒有洗過牠，因爲那不是普通的水可以洗凈的。</p>
<p>我們每天不停地檢，可以換到六七十個銅板，這數目是太小了。然而有什麼法呢？當氣力的價錢不是一樣的時假？就只有從別人的漠視的殘滓裏，來找尋自己的食糧了。我們不希求別人的憐憫，我們知道那是不可能的，正好比妄想從火車的烟囪裏，冒出一塊一磅重的煤炭。我們也不自己嘆息，為的是那樣反會担誤了正經的挖掘的時間。</p>
<p>我們也像我們找尋的東西那樣，是被漠視的。有時還免不了要受點近乎悔辱的輕蔑。繼續現在，我們是流到這兒來了，鐵路在前面慢慢地爬着，我們隨在牠的後面。你看，那千千萬萬的游動的人羣，那就是我們的同伴。一堆又一堆的煤屑，在這蠕蠕的然而是龐大的怪獸的口爪之下，漸漸地消減了。只要我們知道那裏藏有我們生活的資源，卽使是眞正的山嶺，我們也能把牠掘翻呢。雖然在目前，依然是：</p>

<h3>應死而不死琪恩哈羅接連死了三次</h3>
<p>— 缇云</p>
<p>一九三四年是琪恩哈羅的難關，但是她竟安然渡過去了。她以前亦遇到過許多難關，但是都沒有像去年的那樣可怕。琪恩哈羅在去年一年之中——至少亦應當有半年——差不多是一個已經判决死罪的囚犯，靜待着午正三刻的行刑了。現在一九三五年逢臨，又過了幾個月，她才覺得這兇煞已經過去，才敢將這件事講了出來。</p>
<p>當一九三四年的開始，她收到了某星象家一封信，預先警告她，說她在一九三四年年終以前，一定要遇到汽車出險而死的。這封信是由郵局寄來的。那個星象家自動寄來的，琪恩並沒有去請敎過他。</p>
<p>讀者之中有曾聽見過算命先生說他本年要死的沒有。如果你作這種經騐的話，你一定會原諒像琪恩哈羅一個年輕女子的。你可以設身處地的默想一下。在某天的早晨，你正在喝着咖啡，你的傭人送了一大疊的信進來。你一對一對拆着。忽然其中有一封，打開一盾，裏面是封銀長的信，附有星象圖說，旁邊也註着：「據星象的垂示，你在本年年內，將遇汽車橫禍而死。</p>
<p>你看了這個圖說，你能不仔細看下去嗎？並且星相家是中外一律，裏面所用的五行生尅的術語，是普通人所不大明瞭的。這樣更增加了那對信的神奧。夢面並且還附帶舉了許多例，從前他所預示的，一一實騐的經過。最後他還說，除去琪恩之外，還有其他三位電影朋星，亦因星象同樣的擾動，而受到非常的危險。</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅本來想一笑置之的，雖然那不是一椿容易的事。但是她却有差不多半年之久，將那種事漸漸置之度外了，直等到有一天，一個電影明星遇到橫禍死了。那個明星，齊巧是那個無名星象家信中所提到的人。這樣一來，不是预示琪恩的死，是鑄定不得改變的了嗎！她心中的惴惴不安，亦就可想而知的了。你不信儘管不言，而可能量是可能也。</p>
<p>「天下的事，人類所不能了解的，或祇能了解一部份的，儘多儘多，」琪恩哈羅說。「我怎能說星象的指示是不可靠的呢？所以我旣不能說信，亦不能說不信。」但是爲萬一安全起見，並且爲尊重她母親的意思起見，她從此以後，不一人開車，雖然她是最喜自己駕駛的。她的車夫亦受了她母親的嚴厲告誡，不得超過三十五邁爾的速率。長涂汽車旅行，更是琪恩所竭力避免的。</p>
<p>但是琪恩竟死了，據外間的報告和謠言——并且死了多少次！不知道這些報告，是從那裏發生的，不過每次外間發牛謠傳，琪恩的家中必定接到報館的電話，慰唁哩，詢間詳情哩，忙得不亦樂乎。第一次一家晨報突然在夜半一時，打電話到琪恩家，先慰問，後探聽詳情。琪恩的母親接了電話，明知自己女兒好好睡在家裏牀上，就告訴他們，完全沒有那回事。但是他們不信。琪恩的母親沒有法子，就將琪恩從牀上叫了起來，和他們對話，總算過去了。</p>
<p>到了第二次，亦是在夜半，琪恩亦已睡在家裏。很奇怪的，兩次都是說琪恩的汽車關的禍。到了第三次，事態更嚴重了。落杉磯好幾家報紙同時登載着，琪恩哈羅枉死的新聞，用大字標題，說琪恩哈羅從某處看了足球回來，汽車出險了。琪恩的死，外間已是闹得滿城風雨，她自己却一些沒有知道。她那天晚上，有朋友請她晚膳。她從　影塲出來，一直到那朋友家去。大家却在談論琪恩的死，咨嗟慘怛着。琪恩一進去，大家都嘿然。琪恩覺得奇怪，但是尤其奇怪的，她那朋友看見客到，連忙上前握手，一看却是琪恩哈羅，她哎喲一聲嚇死了。</p>
<p>等到主人醒過來，她說她當琪恩的鬼出現了呢。琪恩現在舊事重提，使她不禁啞爾，但是在一九三四之內，她却笑不出來也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「方芸英」—金城</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>「方芸英」在銀幕上開映着，田漢的「名優之死」的印象，不斷的浮上心頭。雖然銀幕上並沒有寫明「名優之死」的改編，可是事實上是從那裏脫胎而來的，不過在後面增加一些「名優之死」所沒有的情節，而爲藝術而藝術的名優（陳老板）在這裏也沒有死。相反的他是從外國跑了一趟，回國後便紅了起來，同時曾經被捧角兒的大爺們打下去了的方芸英，也因此而紅極一時。至於方芸英嫁了一個文學家的丈夫等等，也是原著上所沒有的。</p>
<p>「名優之死」是作者的前期作品，小有產者作家的正義感，滲合着爲藝術而藝術的主觀，在作品中表現出來。在那裏作者化裝了名優老生，他演唱着「打漁殺家」等比較有反抗性的劇，同時他也將若干劇本加以改編，或者創作一些適合時代的劇本。他相信「唱戲的是靠玩意兒吃飯的」，只有那是戲于的藝術生命，所以他看見自己所一手敎導出來的女徒弟和捧角兒的大爺們胡鬧着，放棄了演技的修養，爲看戲劇的熱愛，他感覺極大的傷心，同時他對於楊大爺之流的人，又不能反抗而把握着勝利，於是他以年老之軀，便給殘毒的對建勢力殺害了。現在銀幕上的「方芸英」，却將名優劉老板的精神放鬆了，將劇的重心放在他的女徒弟方芸英身上。她和捧角兒的人們極力周旋，隨後忽然大徹大悟，和一文學家結婚，因此被捧角兒的大爺們懷恨妒嫉，在戲院裏喝倒采，將極紅的女伶打下去了。而文學家的丈夫也因被書店老板所壟斷，不能維持二人的生活.一直到後來跟着回國後的師傅再紅起來。我們並不說這樣的故事完全要不得，不過正義感的劉老板的前後行徑與觀念，（他在外國去考察戲劇，只是坐在咖啡座裏唱歌而已。而說明上「因爲他曾經到外國去溜過一次」等字樣，似乎也是　諷着他的。（却因此無理山的矛盾起來，未免失常了。同時這也許就是不寫明改編字樣的原因罷？</p>
<p>就現在所表現着的故事來說，如方芸英的種種，固然都還表示着劇作者在道德上正義感的傾向，但是因着劇作者的表現方法不够，沒有將劇的內容充分的表現出來。而劇的本意，我們還得在畫面之外加一番揣摩，才能體念出來。原則的說，電影是藉形象而思維的藝術，因而得電影藝術的地將內容形象化，否則，如不能直接通過觀衆　覺與聴覺的感受而傅達，便不是成功的電影作品。劇作者對於劇本寫作技巧，似乎是十分生疏的，再山於導演對於織接法沒有深切的研究，於是除了祇好以字慕來解說劇情之外，故事是支離破碎的，尤以結尾的突然，更使觀衆感覺不滿。</p>
<p>再說罷，導演對於空氣不能描賮；買票看戲的人們是那般生病似的從容無力，劇院中也是那麽冷落，又如開始時劇院老板找不着方芸英，也沒有緊張的空氣，可見他是不懂得Tempo把握不住劇的情調的。至於開始時方芸英偕少年多人走進後豪，和楊少敏向陳老板看，不接上一個陳老板在洗手的中景，再加上許多不必要的長鏡頭或搖鏡頭，都可證明這一影片是沒有經過很好的剪接的。收音不淸，也加多了作品的缺憾。</p>
<p>雖然如此說，然而由於攝影技術的成就，有許多個別的塲面，很可以看看。最精采的是方芸英同楊少敏傑夜回家，攝影佈景等等，也都很好。至於演技方面，雖然主要的演員在過去都有過若干成就，而在這裏却因　導演沒有較好的支配，每一人都見生疏。即如魏鶴齡在舞臺劇上演「名優之死」很成功的，在這一影片中却因爲很少做戲的機會，以及劇本的限制，不能發揮傷感的氣氛，結果也只是沒有特殊精采的配角而已。</p>
<h3>評「薔薇之歌」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>—新光映—</p>
<p>「薔薇之歌」是述一個歌舞女的戀愛，也就是她一生的悲劇，而這悲劇的成因，採作者借歌舞班主人親口告訴主角梅香，說是由於「陳舊的思想，勢利的社會」。因此我們可以看到作者的主旨，在於爲一個也就是現社會中所有的歌舞女們對這一陳舊的思想，與勢利的社會」嗚不平，以她們慘酷的遭遇，與凄凉的身世來激動人同情。換句話說，這是張相當地暴露舊禮敎的吃人，與反封建的作品。但是通過了攝影機，而反映在銀幕上的「薔薇之歌」，是否是電影藝術的地完成了牠們反封建的使命呢？不幸的是據作者並不會如他所想像的做到。這兒他想暴露與反封建，由於他太單純地了解了現社會中的封建勢力，結果只撲了個空。</p>
<p>由於這主題把握的不穩，給人看到的就不是整個的封建禮敎，而僅是老媽媽的個人了。因此除了她之外，全劇中人都失去了個性，我們看到男主角沈希仁與梅香所做的戲，全是作者硬派給他們的。表妹成了作者隨便取用的木偶，妹妹僅是活的佈景。至於梅弟的在書面上沒有交代，梅香做女工的沒有過程等缺點，還是小事。</p>
<p>全劇混淆雜亂，只見車來車去，出門進悶的過塲，與時間，以及地點與事件介紹的說明。許多大有戲做的塲合，如沈與表妹的見面，沈與梅香分別三四年，在歌舞班後面的相遇，頑固的母親和梅香的會見，和失去梅後的沈希仁方面等，都輕輕地放了過去。倒着重在梅香的爭取二百元來贖愛這近於笑話的戲上，因此更把希仁寫成沒有絲毫個性。</p>
<p>全片的「淡入」一淡出一，除了病床上的三兩個「化」鏡頭外，不見一個技巧的「刻脫」來代替所有不必要的過塲，再加幾處挿入的複寫的失當，把本來就零亂的戲，更弄得沉悶呆板。如開始人在海濱唱歌時，呆板的一個鏡頭到底，只是長長的歌詞，不寫些週遭的情景。又如管家的來報旱災時，母女弟三人侷促在床角邊沒有反映。弟弟把母親當麵條似的　着，說是母親快要死了。</p>
<p>歌舞班的演出中，也呆板地只把鏡頭對着台面，旣不用觀衆來反映台上，也忘了觀衆的希仁。這些都是最初步的失常處。至於寫醫院的沒有醫院空氣，三等病房中的男病人床上，可以由一個女人和衣睡到天明。醫院中人沒有睡醒的早晨，家屬就可以來接病人出院等，也都是成爲笑話的疎忽之處。</p>
<p>說到演技，男主角除了病時有點動　之外，連一身四裝，一個沒刮臉的，鬢角，都始終如一地不曾剪剃一下。在姿態與動作上，若不是字幕說他留過洋，當了敎授，誰也不會看出他是一個有如此身份的人物。女主角總算在够多的機會，還有着一點兒演做。自然，至於演做得够不够是另一問題。</p>
<p>至於攝影，空氣與情調固然談不上，就運讓觀衆看得淸楚劇中人的面貌都多半不曾做到。同樣配的音樂，也會沒有機地帮助劇情的發展，無原則地配着浮促逸盪的調子，喜怒哀樂，書面與音樂是各不相關的。</p>
<p>末了，記者至誠地說，以上所云或者不免有些過於嚴格吧。在爲整個影藝的求進步上，深願作者能用諍言來克服一些客觀上的欠缺。自然，關於構影配音等也有着物質上的限制的</p>

<p>克萊夫乎裏驚着艾德蒙胸前的小金匣，自言自語道：「不能不想法子。怎樣就能脫離這種非人的生活呢？」那金匣的蓋突然開了。他瞪着眼睛，看了裏面一位如花似玉的美人。他看了半嚮，然後慢慢地抬起頸來，望着他的朋友道：「這是……」艾德蒙道：一那是我的妹妹，瑪格勒蒂。」克萊夫於是再仔細看了一回然後說道：「眞秀麗……你想……她肯到這個地方來嗎？一</p>
<p>艾徳蒙麥斯格林笑道：「或者……但是為什麽呢？」克萊夫道：一我要娶她爲妻。」在這個時候，麥斯格林的眉頭縐着，心中有些惱怒。他想克萊夫那種無意味的調侃，未免過份了些。但是克萊夫却先急了，他自辯着他並不是開玩笑。艾德蒙和他理論道：「那亦是無濟於事的。如果現在立即寫信給她，要六個月個可以得到她的回靑。如果要她來，一年才可以到。但是在這種地方，誰能料到一年以內的事呢？</p>
<p>克萊夫道：一不差的，一年之內事情很多。但是，艾徳蒙，有時我想到了一件我應該作的事，我就非作不可！我自己知道，我不是終老於這溝壑之中的……現在看了這張相片，我知道她就是我終身的配偶！」艾德蒙看看他，覺得他亦不是平常人。他那一往無前的勇敢，他有不甘落後的志氣。他不是肯永久屈伏於環境的。他於是說道：「那末你寫信給她吧……」一回他又奇怪道：「勞伯特，我從來沒有見過你這樣，你爲什麽發抖呢？」克萊夫的聲音顫抖着道：「難道你不明白嗎？等她來的時候，我拿什麽獻給她呢？」</p>
<p>正在這個時候，克萊一生難逢的機會到了。正在他們二人說完話之後，外面一陣軍號聲，跟着就是一陣急足亂跑的聲音。一般好事員都齊集攏來，打聽遠來的消息。原來法國人進兵來襲取英國的通商碼頭了。他們率領了印度士兵，要將英國人的勢力一掃而空。麥得拉期的英國根據地，已經喪失了。克萊夫對着艾德蒙通：「好了。機會到了！這是千載難逢的機會！」</p>
<p>艾德蒙遲疑道：「你說的是軍隊嗎？」克萊夫道：「軍隊。腐敗的軍隊……貧財愛命的軍隊……，落伍的軍隊，如同弓箭在槍砲面前一樣的落伍—他們所需要的，是你和我！你來不來？艾徳蒙道「不過……克萊夫不等他說完，拉了他的臂膀道：「我知道你一定來的。」他將他一拉，拉到舉格德總督的辦公！裏。他們向總督聲明，要辭去公司的職務，加入軍隊去和法國人打仗去。羅格德看見兩位少年勇敢有爲，亦很高興，當時答應了他們的請求。</p>
<p>這樣，他們就忽忽忙忙地加入了軍隊，但是克萊夫於萬忙之中，却尋到了一些功夫，寫了一封信寄回英國。那面收信的人，就是艾德蒙麥斯格林的妹妹，瑪格勒蒂麥斯格林。却說瑪格勒蒂不久接到了克萊夫的信，芳心之中起了一種衝激。這樣一個貊貊生生的男子，僅是她哥哥的一位同事，竟寫信給一個從來沒有見過的女子，向她求婚，並且要她到萬里之外的印度去，和他結婚……（未完）</p>

<h3>Closing of the Cooperation Discussion Conference: The Final Meeting Passes Several Important Proposals, Establishing Principles for the Cooperative Financial System</h3>
<p>President Wang Delivers Closing Remarks; The Conference Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Cooperation Discussion Conference held its final meeting on the morning of the 17th at 8:00 AM, chaired by Peng Xuepei. It resolved several important proposals, including the cooperative financial system, and adjourned at approximately 10:00 AM. The closing ceremony was held at 11:00 AM, with President Wang presiding and delivering remarks. A representative of the members, Wen Qun, responded. The meeting adjourned at noon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Cooperation Discussion Conference closed at noon on the 17th, issuing a declaration that stated: "In recent years, the national economy has declined daily, the people's livelihood has become impoverished, the nation's progress has been difficult, cities are on the verge of poverty, and rural areas are on the brink of bankruptcy. While the root causes are multifaceted, the lack of appropriate economic organization among the people is a significant factor. To correct deficiencies and implement fundamental construction, it is necessary to promote cooperative enterprises as the foundation of the national economy. This is indicated by the late Premier Sun's instruction and is also one of the seven major movements during the period of political tutelage. Its importance in establishing a plan for economic construction to improve the people's livelihood is self-evident. In the face of global economic panic and domestic national difficulties, collective effort should be made to promote its success. The National Economic Committee, the Rural Reconstruction Committee of the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industries, recognizing this, convened the National Cooperation Enterprise Discussion Conference in the capital on March 13, 1935. Representatives from central party and government authorities, provincial and municipal governments, social, academic, and financial organizations promoting cooperation across the country, and experts in cooperative research gathered together, sharing their experiences and discussing methods of progress. Over the five days of the conference, more than one hundred proposals were made. After deliberation, the participants were further convinced of the importance of cooperative enterprises. In the future, they should each do their best, cooperate, and work to promote them, following the government's guidance and meeting the people's needs, to achieve the autonomy of the national economy and the completion of cooperative enterprises. China has vast lands and abundant resources, but customs and habits may not be entirely the same in all regions. While detailed regulations for various aspects of cooperative enterprises are not suitable, it is still necessary to establish principles, form a system, design comprehensively, and implement them separately. Then, like a net with a guiding rope, there will be order and method. All proposals paid attention to this, and plans were made for the national cooperative administrative system and cooperative organizational system. In the future, the implementation methods in various regions will have standards to follow, and the foundation of the national cooperative economy will be established. This is the first cause for celebration for the future of cooperative enterprises. Recently, general financial institutions in our country have risen up to support cooperative enterprises. This is a point of difference in the progress of China's cooperative enterprises compared to other countries. This time, principles were also established for methods of rural investment, etc., as a standard for progress. Indeed, rural and urban areas complement each other, and the assistance of urban capital can trigger the self-rescue of the rural economy. The government also has a systematic financial organization for this, and efficiency will inevitably increase, and the rural economy can be expected to develop. This is the second cause for celebration for the future of cooperative enterprises. Agricultural and industrial production in our country is not entirely the same in all regions, and cooperative enterprises can be operated concurrently and in parallel. The participants believe that production and sales cooperation should be emphasized, especially through the establishment of a national general organization for transportation, sales, and supply by the government, so that the products of various provinces can be easily organized, adjusted, and managed in a unified manner, and the national economy can enter the path of self-sufficiency and corresponding supply and demand. This is the third cause for celebration for the future of cooperative enterprises. The foundation of construction lies in education, and the development of enterprises relies on talent. The people must have business training so that cooperative organizations can have the possibility of autonomous management. Guiding personnel emphasize academic experience, and cooperative enterprises can have the hope of continued growth. This time, principles were established for cooperative education, and methods were formulated for public training, which can be expected to be implemented. This is the fourth cause for celebration for the future of cooperative enterprises. Our nation has had its spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation for five thousand years, but the manifestation of this spirit depends on the organization of cooperation. If we can provide guidance, so that we can gradually use this organization, without seeking quick results and not being greedy for immediate success, and plant its foundation among the people, then the future of the national economy has infinite hope. The participants saw the expectations of all aspects of the country for cooperative enterprises and felt the importance of their responsibilities. They should work harder, strive to engage in it, so that the national cooperative enterprises can be developed and nurtured, gradually leading to success. It is hoped that the gentlemen of our country will rise up together to plan for it." (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang stated in his closing address at the Cooperation Discussion Conference on the 17th: "Since the start of the discussion conference, all of you have based your scholarship and experience, coupled with harmonious deliberation in the conference, and have been able to create various proposals in the shortest period, so that various issues concerning the progress of cooperative enterprises have all been appropriately resolved. This spirit and these achievements are deeply admirable. I just heard the conference declaration and know that various issues and resolutions concerning the cooperative system, cooperative business, cooperative finance, cooperative education, and other issues are all extremely related to the progress of cooperative enterprises. Originally, the evolution of every enterprise often starts with the mental effort of one or two people. Afterwards, it tends to become complex due to separate developments, and then it is organized into a simplified system. Now the cooperative enterprise is also following this evolutionary path. Initially, Mr. Xue Xianzhou painstakingly advocated it, followed by all of you striving for progress in your respective locations, coinciding without consultation and unanimously. In more than a decade, the number of cooperatives has increased to over ten thousand. Now all of you have joined together to create a system of cooperative enterprise, giving it a center and a whole organization to promote the national cooperative enterprise. This cannot but be said to be a progress of the cooperative enterprise, and it is also an important contribution of this conference. As for the cooperative financial issue, it is certainly not easy to solve in the current situation of the declining rural economy and the government's financial constraints, but if this issue cannot be resolved, the future of cooperative enterprises will have almost no progress to speak of. In this conference, Mr. Wang Zhixin had a very good proposal on the cooperative financial system. The content of this proposal can be described as comprehensive and insightful. Furthermore, all of you carefully scrutinized it during the review, and it was satisfactorily passed in the conference. This is also an important contribution of this conference. In addition, various proposals have achieved extremely good results, which have already been included in the declaration and do not need to be listed one by one. Originally, we had a common goal in the conference, which was how to make farmers feel the need for cooperation and the interest in cooperation, and how to make cooperative enterprises achieve the great purpose of relieving farmers' suffering and increasing farmers' benefits. With the vastness of China's territory and the largest proportion of farmers in the population, it is not easy to popularize cooperative enterprises among farmers. In addition, the underdevelopment of transportation and the lack of popularization of education make the progress of cooperative enterprises hampered. But precisely because of this, our efforts for cooperative enterprises cannot be delayed. We deeply know that cooperative enterprises not only enable the farmer's economy to be well resolved, but also enable the farmer's morality to be well trained. Chinese farmers were originally confined to individualism and familism. The development of various cooperative organizations can make the virtue of collectivism, along with the improvement of economic life, increasingly developed. Therefore, we do not regard cooperative enterprises as a branch policy, but as a fundamental policy of the state and society. Because of this, our efforts cannot be slackened. The Cooperation Discussion Conference closes today. The meaning of this closing is that the discussion is over and the implementation begins. As a government servant, I deeply know that the government's responsibility will be increased from now on. The improvement and development of cooperative enterprises rely on your continuous efforts, and the government's political power will promote it. This responsibility cannot be relaxed. I am willing to work together with all of you to shoulder the responsibility of implementing the resolution, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep respect for the hard work and contributions of all of you in the past few days, and I wish all of you good health." (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the last general meeting of the Cooperation Discussion Conference on the morning of the 17th, over one hundred members, including Wang Zhixin, Tang Jianfei, and Gao Bingwei, passed 26 proposals. The most important cases were: (1) The Cooperative Financial System Case established principles: A. Cooperative finance should focus on regulating the funds of mutual credit in rural areas so that surplus funds in rural areas will not be stagnant and flow to urban areas, and at the same time, it should establish close connections with urban finance, so that distorted urban finance can flow into rural areas through this mechanism; B. It should focus on supporting rural production funds within five years; C. Cooperative financial institutions should be used to absorb scattered floating funds to promote the self-sufficiency of farmers' funds; D. The entire cooperative financial system should be used to regulate isolated and helpless rural finance; E. The power of cooperative finance should be used to achieve the purpose of improving production and facilitating sales; F. The capital contribution of cooperative finance should mainly be the share capital of cooperatives below the county level, and the government's capital contribution or subsidies should be the mainstay above the provincial level; G. Cooperative finance should adhere to the principle of conducting exclusive transactions, so that the credit status of borrowers can be clear and unambiguous, and the resources of lenders can also be continuous; H. Cooperative financial institutions should also operate agricultural warehouse businesses to control and regulate the production and sales of rural areas; I. Trust business should also be operated to expand the function of rural financial organizations; J. Cooperative finance should use the method of issuing bonds to obtain low-interest funds. (2) The Cooperative Administrative System Case: Regarding the central government, the competent authority for cooperative enterprises is the Ministry of Industries, and it should also jointly appoint experts with relevant ministries and committees to organize the National Cooperative Enterprise Association. Regarding the provinces and cities, they should follow the central government's methods and submit them to the Ministry of Industries for discretionary handling. The Cooperative Association should jointly form a Cooperative Enterprise Bureau with the provinces and cities. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Strictly Prohibits Excessive Levies</h3>
<p>Telegrams Orders to Sichuan Generals to Supervise Inspections and Stop Them</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang telegraphed all commanders and deputy commanders in Sichuan on the 16th: "After the establishment of the Sichuan Provincial Government, all commanders and deputy commanders requested the abolition of defense zones and the return of power to the provincial government. According to successive reports from the chairman of the provincial government, they have been commended in separate telegrams, and telegrams were also sent on the 20th ordering the transfer on a set date. Recently, according to reports from various parties, the counties are taking the opportunity of the transition between the old and new administrations and the scarcity of supplies to arbitrarily impose excessive levies, showing a tendency to intensify oppression and exploit in advance. Now is the period of suppressing bandits. How can the rear politics be allowed to be tyrannical again, further afflicting the people of Sichuan? If the reported situation is true, it will have a great impact on sweeping away bandits and improving the future of Sichuan's administration. Since I bear the purpose of saving the people from fire and water, it is especially contrary to the intention of all commanders and deputy commanders to return power. It is difficult to ignore it and must be enforced according to law. Moreover, since all commanders and deputy commanders have just returned power, if all handover matters have not been concluded, supervision and prevention of the original county officials are still their unavoidable responsibility. You must immediately order strict investigation and prohibition by the chairman and all commanders and deputy commanders. If there are deliberate violations, they should be punished separately without favoritism or delay, and a report should be submitted on a set date." (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Incident of Passengers Being Blocked from Leaving the Pass: Preparations for Negotiations in Tianjin; Decrease in Ticket Purchasers for the Beiping-Shenyang Train; The Qing Committee Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss It</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Japanese side's ban on Chinese people leaving the pass, according to people from Yuguan this morning, it is indeed a fact. Although it has not been explicitly stated that Chinese people are not allowed to go to the Northeast, inspections are particularly harsh. For example, when inspecting the poor peasant class, the poor peasant must explain in detail the destination and the task of this trip, and submit the amount of travel expenses and living expenses prepared for this trip, otherwise they will be ordered to return immediately. When inspecting the luggage of first and second class passengers, the same restrictions apply if Western suits, books, newspapers, etc. are found. As a result, more than a thousand passengers have been blocked in recent days, and Yuguan hotels are full. The condition of the general poor peasants is particularly miserable. Regarding the paid fare for the section outside the pass, the Japanese side is responsible for signing it separately, and the tickets are refunded by the originating stations. The issue will be negotiated by representatives of both sides in Tianjin, and a solution is expected to be obtained in a short time. Before the issue is resolved, Beiping Station will still sell through tickets. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the incident of Japanese people blocking Chinese people from leaving the pass, the number of ticket purchasers for the Beiping-Shenyang train has decreased since yesterday. Zhang Shuiqi, the manager of the Oriental Hotel, is now in Yuguan and has reported the incident to Yin Tong, requesting that he contact the Japanese side immediately. As for the refund procedures for the ticket price of the section outside the pass for the passengers who were blocked and how to handle the loss of train tickets for passengers returning to the original place, please also ask the railway authorities for instructions. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In order to recruit Chinese laborers to leave the pass in various places in North China, the Japanese recently established a branch of the Da Dong Company in a certain concession in Tianjin, specializing in selling entry permits, each paper for 30 cents. Those who hold this certificate are allowed to pass when passing Yuguan and Gubeikou. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side claims that 7 million laborers have left the pass to seek a living in the past three years, and all places feel crowded. The industries of the Japanese and Korean nationalities have been affected. Therefore, it has been decided to crack down on unemployed people leaving the pass. Our side has not received an official report on this matter. The railway bureau sells tickets as usual. Gu Tong and Tao Shangming are in Tianjin and plan to discuss the matter with Yi Wo when he returns from Malanyu. The Qing Committee will hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss negotiation methods for this matter. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese and puppet police in Shanhaiguan cracked down on Chinese people leaving the pass. After inquiring with relevant parties, it was learned that Japan is preventing the increase of the population in the Northeast, as too many laborers going there hinder the production and business of the Japanese and Korean nationalities. Therefore, since the 14th, anyone without a definite occupation and proof is not allowed to leave the pass. However, merchants and those who look like they belong to the middle and upper classes are allowed to pass, and mud, wood, and tile workers are also allowed to enter. Since the 14th, more than 2,000 laborers have gathered in Shanhaiguan and are not allowed to leave the pass. Except for the fare of the section outside the pass refunded to passengers on the 14th, no refunds have been made to passengers on the 15th and 16th. Passenger negotiations are also ineffective. Generally, they are still in Yutang and other places, waiting for a solution. (17th)</p>
<h3>Various Issues in the War Zone: Continued Consultations in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tomorrow, continued consultations on various issues in the war zone will be held in Tianjin. Our representatives are Gu Tong and Tao Shangming, and the Japanese representatives are Yi Wo and Takahashi. Yin Rugeng is currently in Malanyu and is expected to fly back to Tianjin this afternoon. In addition to the issues of the extension of the Xinbao Security Team and the receipt of Dongling, the content of this consultation will also include cases such as the blocking in Yuguan.

<p>(Beiping) After returning to Beiping from Changchun last night, Takahashi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, left Beiping for Tianjin that night to attend the consultations on various issues in the war zone. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Recurring Disturbances in Yutian; No Bandit Traces Near Malanyu</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 15th, a conflict occurred between the Chang Tingbo and Zhang Yinting troops of the local militia of Woluogu Town, Fourth District, Yutian and the Wang Jizong troops. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for two hours. The Chang and Zhang troops were disarmed by the Wang troops, and the Wang militia immediately entered the town to garrison it. Fearing that the disturbances would escalate, County Magistrate Zhao Congyi specially sent commissioners to persuade and appease them and to wait for a solution. More than 300 mutinous soldiers of the Feng Shoupeng troops, with complete firearms, fled outside the Jieling Pass to the Jin Mine in Daoxiaoliushui, Xinglong County, on the 15th. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The bandits discovered in Malanyu came from the border of Yutian County. The bandit leader, nicknamed Yang Er, is extremely ferocious. The bandits number about 200 and plunder wantonly wherever they go. At that time, a part of the Feng Shoupeng troops of the Lai'an Team mutinied and fled to that place. Yin Rugeng flew to Malanyu yesterday to negotiate a solution. The bandits, hearing the news and knowing that they could not succeed, fled out of the pass through Xinglong County last night. There are no bandit traces near Malanyu today. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The police of the Qinhuangdao Public Security Bureau checked household registrations and busted a false organization in No. 5, Bao'anli, arresting Wei, the false commander of the East Asia Allied Army, and several false brigade commanders, etc. Multiple items such as handguns, bullets, blank commissions, and seals were seized. Hundreds of commissions have been filled out.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Reorganize: Miscellaneous Silver Coins Nationwide</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance handed over the reorganization of miscellaneous silver auxiliary coins nationwide to the Monetary System Reorganization Committee and the Financial Advisory Discussion Meeting for careful research. It is heard that the method is to adopt a gradual approach. On the one hand, the central banks in various places should absorb miscellaneous silver as much as possible, and on the other hand, the central bank should increase the number of decimal auxiliary coin notes on the market. As for the replacement of the essence of hard coins in the future, the Monetary System Committee and the Advisory Meeting are considering it. Initially, many experts suggested using nickel or antimony, which cannot be cast without more than 200 pounds of pressure to prevent private manufacturing. However, the central mint does not have this type of machinery, and raw materials have not been purchased, and the casting cost is higher than that of silver coins. It is advocated that the first step should be to standardize the color. The Ministry of Finance is now planning to collect opinions from all parties and ask the Central Political Council for approval. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industries Plans to Universally Establish Agricultural Banks in Various Places</h3>

Branch offices should be established in various provinces, and sub-branch offices or agencies should also be established in counties, townships, and towns. The total capital of the head office is 10 million yuan, the branch offices have 5 million yuan, and the sub-branch offices have at least 50,000 yuan. Whether to issue banknotes has not yet been determined. After the entire plan is decided, it will be submitted to the central government for approval. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Yunnan Industry Bureau Abolished; Merged into Construction Bureau, Zhang Banghan Remains Director</h3>

(3) To promote provincial and county roads throughout the province and save expenditures, a Provincial Highway Administration Bureau should be established immediately to handle the matter. The bureau will have one director-general, concurrently held by Long Yun, and Yang Wenqing will serve as the co-director. The Highway Funding Committee should be abolished immediately and merged into the Highway Administration Bureau. (4) Suitable locations should be selected in the provincial capital and in county towns and rural towns to establish sports fields. In addition to the existing Beimenwai sports field in the provincial capital, two more sports fields should be opened. Each county town and its rural towns should each establish one sports field. In the future, all counties should actively promote sports. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

The film is a famous Soviet production, having won awards at the Venice Film Exhibition in Italy and certificates at the Moscow Film Festival. The film depicts the story of the Soviet icebreaker "Chelyuskin" expedition to the Arctic in the summer of 1934. The entire plot is very suspenseful. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government, because the total budget could not be completed on schedule due to the failure of the competent authorities to submit their budgets, had previously submitted a request to the National Government to urge them. It is now learned that the military, Mongolian and Tibetan, industrial, judicial, internal affairs, foreign affairs, transportation, education, and cultural expenditure estimates have been successively sent to the Directorate. Financial, debt, subsidy, and compensation, and construction expenses have not yet been sent. The Directorate General is now urging them to be processed separately. It is reported that after the Central Political Committee decides on the political plan for preparing the total budget and submits it, the Directorate will convene all the competent authorities to allocate the detailed figures, so that the total budget can be completed as soon as possible.

<h3>Is the Economic Recession Really Due to Monetary Contraction?</h3>
<p>— A Cold Observation</p>
<p>Recently, China's rural areas have been impoverished, various industries have been sluggish, and commercial markets have suffered from poor turnover due to stockpiles of inventory. Factories have reduced production or even gone bankrupt and liquidated due to slow sales of their products. Consequently, commentators assert that "this economic recession is caused by the rise in global silver prices. High silver prices lead to the outflow of silver, which in turn leads to monetary contraction. Monetary contraction causes prices to fall, leading to the decline of all industries and a bleak outlook, almost to the point of being unsustainable." I do not entirely agree with this view. Is the decline in prices really caused by the rise in silver prices, or are there other complex reasons? Has the money supply (in the narrow sense) really contracted? Instead of calling it monetary contraction, wouldn't it be more accurate to call it credit contraction? Is credit contraction the cause of the economic recession, or is credit contraction a consequence of the economic recession? Which is the cause and which is the effect? Exploring the origins of these issues requires careful thought. Some people mistake the effect for the cause, or only see part of the picture and not the whole. This is why there are so many conflicting opinions and no fundamental solution has been found. Based on my limited observations, there are many reasons for the recent decline in prices, generally including the following:</p>
<p>(1) Exports are sluggish due to reduced overseas demand.</p>
<p>(2) The sales of machine-made domestic goods (such as cotton yarn and flour) that were previously sold to the four northeastern provinces have now decreased.</p>
<p>(3) The prices of agricultural products have plummeted due to the influence of global market conditions.</p>
<p>(4) Various countries' currencies have abandoned the gold standard, causing a sharp drop in exchange rates against China, which has made imported goods cheaper and intensified competition.</p>
<p>(5) Residents in the interior are harassed by bandits and plagued by exorbitant taxes, coupled with frequent natural disasters, making their livelihoods difficult. Purchasing power is becoming increasingly weak.</p>
<p>(6) With reduced exports of domestic goods and depleted finances in the interior, the sales of general goods are becoming increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the decline in prices is not entirely due to the rise in silver prices. Moreover, before August of last year, although there were significant changes in exchange rates, there were no special changes in silver prices. It seems one-sided and incomplete to attribute everything to silver prices without careful examination.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to study carefully whether the money supply has contracted since September 18th. The following table shows the number of banknotes issued by various banks in Shanghai in the last three years for comparison:</p>
<p>Thousands of Yuan</p>
<p>July, 1931: 310,520</p>
<p>January, 1932: 262,410</p>
<p>July, 1932: 225,170</p>
<p>January, 1933: 299,131</p>
<p>July, 1933: 278,137</p>
<p>January, 1934: 341,459</p>
<p>July, 1934: 349,589</p>
<p>January, 1935: 404,416</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the total amount of banknotes issued by various banks in Shanghai, although somewhat reduced in 1932 and the first half of 1933, has not only not decreased in the most recent year and a half, but has actually increased compared to before September 18th. Although there are also banknotes issued by banks in various provinces and commercial firms in various places that cannot be statistically accounted for, and there is no accurate figure for the amount of hard currency in circulation, it can be asserted that the money supply has not contracted compared to before. Since last winter, financial stagnation has occurred in various places, and banks in Shanghai have been unwilling to lend to various industries, resulting in credit contraction. This is indeed a fact. Private financial institutions are focused on self-preservation, claiming to be responsible to depositors and banknote holders, and are unwilling to lend arbitrarily. On the other hand, those in various industries who are in urgent need of relief believe that financial institutions, both public and private, have a responsibility to regulate the market. Both sides have their reasons. However, in these extraordinary times, even small-scale loans are just a drop in the bucket and are not a fundamental solution. In short, economic recession comes first, followed by credit contraction. Increased credit contraction then deepens the economic recession. The two are mutually cause and effect. Therefore, if one wants to remedy the situation, a fundamental solution is necessary. I hope that those who are planning to rescue the market will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Germany Declares Military Expansion, Causing Shock Throughout Europe; Openly Tears Up Military Clauses of the Treaty; Restores Compulsory Military Service for Self-Defense; Concerned Countries to Jointly Protest</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, the restoration of compulsory military service, and the establishment of twelve corps, namely thirty-six divisions, has already become a reality. Chancellor Hitler, who was originally resting in Bavaria, suddenly returned to Beijing yesterday. That evening, he met with various cabinet members, and this afternoon, he held another cabinet meeting, deciding to promulgate the Compulsory Military Service Law. Propaganda Minister Goebbels then released a press release to the press and notified the ambassadors of England, France, and Italy, as well as representatives of other signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles. Chancellor Hitler subsequently issued a proclamation to the people, stating that Germany had strictly implemented the disarmament clauses of the treaty and dismantled various weapons, while the victorious countries were still actively expanding their military preparations. Therefore, Germany's current military strength is far from sufficient to ensure its safety. He stated, "The German government wants to maintain the necessary military force in spirit and substance to maintain peace in Germany, which is to maintain peace in Europe. There is no other request." He then mentioned the Soviet Union's military strength and France's restoration of the two-year conscription system, saying, "The German government is taking necessary measures to ensure safety, which is urgently needed. We hereby solemnly declare again to the people and the world that the measures taken by the German government are limited to what is necessary to safeguard Germany's honor and freedom. This military rearmament is only regarded as a defensive tool to maintain peace and will never be used to attack other countries." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) After Germany decided to immediately conscript more than 500,000 troops, the whole of Europe reached a boiling point today. Chancellor Hitler has discarded the Treaty of Versailles like worn-out shoes. This news spread to capitals around the world in an instant. International observers even said that the current situation is no different from the situation in the Balkans before the European War. (National News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval met with British Charge d'Affaires to France Campbell this morning. Although the content of the conversation was kept completely confidential, well-informed sources believe that the British, French, and Italian governments cannot turn a blind eye to Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, it is possible that they will jointly protest to Germany with the signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Key Points of Hitler's Declaration</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler issued a startling declaration yesterday, causing turmoil in the international community, stating that the failure of other signatories of the Treaty of Versailles to fulfill their obligations and the rejection of Germany's and other disarmament proposals left the German government with no choice but to decide to re-implement the national compulsory military service system and organize a twelve-corps, namely thirty-six-division, peace army. The declaration specifically emphasized the French government's decision to increase the term of military service from one year to two years, and to recruit mercenaries, as well as the Soviet Union's massive increase in military personnel. It then stated that because England, France, and other countries failed to do their part to support Germany's proposal to resolve European difficulties, Germany decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. The declaration was first read by Propaganda Minister Goebbels at a hastily convened press conference of foreign reporters at the Propaganda Department, and then read at a large National Socialist Party rally at the Sportpalast. The main point was that Germany had fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles, but other signatories had not, and some countries had even increased their armaments. Germany, surrounded by heavily armed countries, had no way to defend itself. Germany's and other disarmament proposals had been rejected, leading people to believe that other signatories of the Treaty of Versailles no longer intended to fulfill the disarmament clauses in the treaty. Therefore, the German government felt that it had to take responsibility and take the necessary measures to ensure that Germany was not defenseless. Germany had stated that after the Saar issue was resolved, it would no longer make territorial demands on France, and had proposed a non-aggression pact. However, in view of the fact that the Soviet Union had increased its army to 960,000 men, and France had also decided to recruit mercenaries and extend the term of military service, it felt that it had to take the necessary measures to ensure Germany's security. The declaration was made in response to the request of British Cabinet member Baldwin to clarify Germany's intentions. It was also to let the world know that the responsibility for maintaining Germany's honor and security had been returned to Germany's own power. The last paragraph of the declaration stated that in order to dispel the outside world's suspicion that the German people were now trying to occupy a prominent military position in Europe, the German government guaranteed that Germany's actions would not go beyond the scope of maintaining Germany's honor and security, and would never allow its armaments to provoke hostile attacks, but would only seek to defend the country, thereby maintaining peace.</p>
<p>Before Goebbels read the declaration, he stated that Chancellor Hitler had returned to Berlin after recovering from his illness in Bavaria, and had immediately convened a cabinet meeting to pass the law on rearmament. He then went on to say that Germany was forced into the Great War. He then raised his voice and listed the military equipment that Germany had destroyed in compliance with the Treaty of Versailles. When the declaration was read at the Sportpalast, the cheers were deafening. Goebbels said at the end, "The dead in the Great War are now honored because of this. The living have also obtained the guarantee of future safety. We respectfully bow before the greatness of the motherland with this honor. Long live the leader!" Everyone in the arena then chanted "Long live the leader!" in response. Then they sang the national anthem and the party anthem. The leader of the meeting then asked Goebbels to express the National Socialist Party's full awe and loyalty to Hitler on his behalf. Goebbels told a Reuters reporter that the compulsory military service plan would be applied to the entire air defense system, namely the army, navy, and air force. However, he said that he had no knowledge of increasing naval strength. But according to the current plan, naval soldiers can be recruited in the same way as the army and air force. He also said that the rearmament law stipulates that the police are also incorporated into the army.</p>
<p>After the declaration was read at yesterday's German cabinet meeting, all the cabinet members stood up and shouted "Long live Hitler!" three times, and expressed their loyalty to Hitler. The National Socialist Party's official newspaper published an editorial stating that the government's decision was of great historical significance. This was the greatest honor that the German people had obtained after signing the Treaty of Versailles in humiliation. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Officially Notifies England, France, and Italy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler met with the ambassadors of England, France, and Italy to Germany today. Foreign Minister Neurath was also present. Hitler immediately notified the ambassadors of the three countries of Germany's desire to restore compulsory military service. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Grand Review of the German Defense Forces</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler, amid the enthusiastic cheers of the people, reviewed the German Defense Forces today. European War General Marshal Mackensen, Defense Minister General von Blomberg, Aviation Minister Goering, Admiral Raeder, and Chief of the General Staff of the Defense Forces General von Fritsch all participated in the military review. Over ninety-year-old German veteran Ebelhardt personally presented the Defense Forces with the Honor Cross. Infantry, cavalry, and the Berlin-Potsdam garrison troops all paraded in formation. The military parade was very grand. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Solemn Commemoration of Old Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany today commemorated the fallen soldiers of the European War in a solemn ceremony, and also celebrated Chancellor Hitler's reinstitution of the people's military service system to maintain Germany's security. All newspapers claimed that Hitler's move was the most appropriate way to commemorate the heroes of the European War. The commemoration ceremony was held at the Berlin State Theater, and Hitler himself attended. Defense Minister von Blomberg delivered a speech. Today, all newspapers stated that although March 17th was the anniversary of the founding of Germany's new twelve-corps, thirty-six divisions, this army was not intended to be used to invade others, but to maintain peace, and was of the same significance as England and France increasing their military expenditures. Although important parts of the Treaty of Versailles had been overturned, Germany's restoration of honor should not be regarded as a provocative act against other countries. One newspaper stated that the German people's joy was not due to enthusiasm for war, but to correcting past mistakes. As for what kind of impact Germany's move would have on the outside world, it was still impossible to predict. However, it was hoped that British Foreign Secretary Simon would still be able to come to Germany as originally planned. (National News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany Rejoices Nationwide</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After Hitler announced the abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and the restoration of compulsory military service, tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the Chancellor's Office Square today, shouting Hitler's name, saying, "The leader has returned the army and weapons to our people. Our people are infinitely grateful. May the leader stand in front of the window and receive the cheers of the people!" Chancellor Hitler immediately stood in front of the window, with Party Representative Hess and Propaganda Minister Goebbels standing beside him. At that time, the crowd was intensely eager and rushed to the window, singing "Germany Above All." A ceremony will also be held today to commemorate the fallen soldiers of the European War. At that time, the people are ordered to lower the flag to half-mast to express their condolences. When the memorial ceremony ends, the flag will be raised again until sunset, "to show the joy of the people across the country when Germany restores its sovereignty in military affairs." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) All newspapers commented on the government's announcement of the abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles this morning. The "Stormtrooper" stated, "Hitler intends to make the world aware of the true situation before conducting international talks, so that the world understands the fact that Germany has equal rights to armaments, and there will be no more ambiguity. All future negotiations should be based on this foundation of equal rights to armaments. As for the basis of negotiations indicated in the London Declaration of February 3, it must be completely changed." In addition, Rosenberg, director of foreign affairs for the National Socialist Party, wrote in the "People's Observer" that "Hitler has an unshakable will to maintain Germany's equal rights to armaments in order to strive for peace. 66 million German people are willing to support this aspiration." In short, all German newspapers believe that the government's decision is necessary to cope with the armaments of other countries in Europe. However, diplomatic circles are surprised that Hitler made this decision without waiting for British Foreign Secretary Simon to come to Germany. In addition, German government officials have stated that this decision has no intention of militarism or warmongering, but is only to ensure Germany's security. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>France Hears as if Struck by Lightning; Seeks to Expand Naval and Military Power</h3>
<p>(London) Germany's decision to implement compulsory military training has unilaterally torn up the provisions of Section 5 of the Treaty of Versailles. This move is tantamount to a bomb thrown into the world's diplomatic circles. England, France, Italy, and various authorities in Geneva are considering it. Each concerned power is discussing Germany's move, so no official criticism has yet been issued. Yesterday's declaration by Hitler had already caused alarm in France. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval returned to Paris to confer after receiving Hitler's declaration. According to official sources, France, in view of Germany's actions, has telegraphed its diplomatic representatives abroad to immediately consult with the governments of their host countries. As for what attitude the French government will take, it is not possible to predict at present, as it must await consultation with the powers before any decision can be made. The outcome of the London talks between England and France and the Rome talks between Italy and France is that any country seeking to unilaterally change the military clauses stipulated in the treaty is not permitted. Moreover, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval agreed to consult each other in the event of any such unilateral action. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Simon will soon be traveling to Berlin. The three countries of England, France, and Italy are very concerned about the various plans of the West European Sky Convention, the East European Mutual Assistance Convention, and the Danube Convention, and there is a need for mutual consultation. Regarding Germany's restoration of compulsory military service, according to close associates of former Army Minister General Pétain, "We knew long ago that Germany would take this decision in April or October of this year. General Pétain has been calling for an extension of the term of military service for a reason." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Panic reigns in French officialdom. Prime Minister Flandin has announced that he intends to convene a conference of the four countries of England, Italy, Russia, and France. The chairman of the Naval Committee of the Chamber of Deputies said that the committee will quickly complete the plan for the 35,000-ton super-cruiser, "but I am afraid that it will not be possible to build it in time." At the same time, the naval plan for 1935, namely, the addition of a battleship and several small ships, has been hastily approved by the committee. It is likely that Prime Minister Flandin will also convene a special cabinet meeting on Monday or Tuesday to discuss promoting a plan to increase the French army. After receiving three votes of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, Flandin will have great power over this matter. (National News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Germany's restoration of the compulsory military service system was unexpected by the general public. The French government telegraphed its envoys abroad this evening, ordering them to contact the governments of their host countries. Evening newspapers here are issuing special editions, and the public is calm and there has been no major reaction. The main thoroughfares are as peaceful as ever. The government will not take any action before it exchanges views with England and Italy. The result of the London talks between England and France and the Rome talks between Italy and France is that any country seeking to unilaterally change the military clauses stipulated in the treaty is not permitted. Moreover, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval agreed to consult each other in the event of any such unilateral action. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Simon will soon be traveling to Berlin. The three countries of England, France, and Italy are very concerned about the various plans of the West European Sky Convention, the East European Mutual Assistance Convention, and the Danube Convention, and there is a need for mutual consultation. Regarding Germany's restoration of compulsory military service, according to close associates of former Army Minister General Pétain, "We knew long ago that Germany would take this decision in April or October of this year. General Pétain has been calling for an extension of the term of military service for a reason." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Considers Severity, Cabinet Discusses Response Measures</h3>
<p>(London) British figures were thunderstruck upon hearing the news of Germany's restoration of compulsory military service. Foreign Secretary Simon, who was taking a weekend break in Wales, rushed back to the Foreign Office in the evening to review the declaration issued by German Foreign Minister Neurath. Prime Minister MacDonald has also convened the Cabinet Disarmament Committee to meet tomorrow morning to study the report submitted by British Ambassador to Germany, Phipps, and to discuss the course of action Britain should take. The proposed visits to Germany by Ministers Simon and Eden are especially emphasized. Official circles believe that the decision made by the Hitler government is of an extremely serious nature. Semi-official sources said that the German government made this decision regardless of the outcome of negotiations between Britain and Germany, which renders the proposed visit to Germany by British cabinet members pointless, and the schedule will likely be postponed again. It is noted that the British government has repeatedly declared its opposition to any country unilaterally abolishing treaties. This time, Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles is indeed a unilateral action. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) A temporary cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street at 11 o'clock this morning to discuss Germany's resolution to restore compulsory military service. Although it was not a full cabinet meeting, attendees included key figures such as Prime Minister MacDonald, Lord Privy Seal Baldwin, Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart. The Prime Minister specifically drove from his villa to attend the meeting, demonstrating the importance of this meeting. The meeting lasted for ninety minutes before adjourning, but they continued to consult with each other throughout the day. A full cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow morning, and Foreign Secretary Simon may attend the House of Commons tomorrow afternoon to report on everything, and his remarks should be made public. It is widely believed that the cabinet members discussed the following this morning: (1) whether there should be a formal response to Hitler's declaration; (2) the future direction of disarmament discussions; (3) new issues arising from Simon's visit to Berlin and Eden's visit to Russia and Poland. At the same time, there are cabinet-level and diplomatic activities in other capitals. European politicians want to understand the new situation in detail, so telegrams will be exchanged very busily in the next few days. Viscount Cecil, President of the British League of Nations Union, expressed his opinion on this matter, believing that Germany's actions were very regrettable. Many other British celebrities also expressed their opinions. Ms. Royden said that Hitler's actions are the immediate impact of Britain joining the arms race. Professor Murray believes that there is no reason to panic. Opposition leader Lansbury declared that the only course now is to be determined to reduce armaments and negotiate with Germany. Lord Allen said that the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles must be cancelled first before a new treaty can be concluded, and if only Simon consults with Hitler, an agreement can be reached. Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, did not want to make any criticism on this matter. According to official sources, the British government is currently in consultation with the governments of Italy and other signatory countries of the treaty. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet is currently considering this matter, so there is no criticism, but Germany's declaration has greatly shocked diplomatic circles here, as this document was issued on the eve of Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden's visit to Berlin, which is particularly strange. It is noted that one of the main purposes of Simon and others' visit to Germany is to establish an agreement to replace Section V of the Treaty of Versailles. Attention is also paid here to Germany's insistence on equal rights in recent negotiations, as Germany is demanding to have an army of 300,000 men, equal to that of France. Germany's actions now not only violate the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles but also greatly contradict the basis of recent negotiations. Foreign Secretary Simon returned here from South Wales at 8 o'clock last night and is now discussing the German issue with key Foreign Office officials. The British Ambassador to Germany has also telegraphed about this matter. It is reported that German leader Hitler informed the British Ambassador to Germany that French Prime Minister Flandin's speech in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, which accused Germany of withdrawing from the League of Nations and Germany's rearmament of threatening France, was the reason for his implementation of the compulsory military service plan. German Foreign Minister Neurath also informed the British Ambassador that Germany could have 500,000 troops after implementing compulsory military service, while France could have at most 400,000 troops. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Italy to Consult with Britain and France, Will Clarify Stance in Geneva</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government officially announced today that the government is currently in contact with the British and French governments regarding Germany's rearmament and will announce its position shortly. Italian official circles are currently refusing to criticize the current situation, but according to unofficial sources, Germany's actions were not entirely unexpected. This is one of the reasons why Italy recently strongly advocated that Germany return to the League of Nations and join</p>

<p>European groups. People in Rome believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's recent statement that Italy can deploy seven to eight million soldiers on the battlefield was also issued out of fear that Germany would endanger Italy's security. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding Germany's restoration of compulsory military service, the government issued a declaration stating that it should contact the governments of Britain and France, which shows that Italy is willing to strictly fulfill the promises made by Italy and France on January 7 (i.e., mutual consultation). France has always advocated limiting armaments after organizing security, and Italy has already agreed. Therefore, while supporting the security pact plan, it is also rectifying its armaments to strengthen its national defense. Italy does not regard Germany's abolition of the Treaty of Versailles as sudden. The general public believes that Germany has been preparing to restore compulsory military service for a long time, and specifically used France's increase in military service years as an excuse to announce its implementation. This is the same as using the British White Paper to announce the establishment of the Air Force. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, the governments of Britain, France, and Italy have been consulting with each other since last night in accordance with the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement of January 7 and the Anglo-French London Agreement of February 3, and a result must be obtained. The three countries of Britain, France, and Italy have always maintained solidarity. The British side believes that the various proposals put forward by Britain and France on February 3 cannot be separated, and the recent cabinet meeting has reiterated this statement. The results of the meeting between French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval last night have also been telegraphed to the ambassadors to London and Rome, and they will contact the governments of the two countries nearby. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Simon's Visit to Germany May Be Postponed</h3>
<p>(London) Whether British Foreign Secretary Simon should postpone his visit to Germany is now a question. However, if the visit to Berlin is postponed, then Lord Privy Seal Eden's visit to Russia and Poland will also be affected. It is noted that the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles were already mentioned in the Anglo-French document of February 3. The document stated that the British and French governments are willing to establish a security pact to replace Section V of the treaty. The BBC's new diplomatic commentator broadcast tonight, saying that Germany knew that Britain and France would ask it to fix its armaments, so it decided to set the highest armament standards before the negotiations began. This is the only reason for Germany's declaration. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Impressions from Geneva</h3>
<p>(Geneva) International circles here have been deeply impressed by Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, believing that the German government's move is clearly a preemptive strike to make it easier to win in future negotiations. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations was very surprised after receiving the telegram from Germany that it would implement a compulsory military service plan. League of Nations personnel are deeply afraid that the situation will become more complicated as a result, and that the hostility and criticism caused by this move will make the possibility of understanding between European countries even more distant. However, at the same time, they also feel that Germany's decision to rearm is actually a factual situation, but only slightly changed by sacrificing its legal status. Therefore, League of Nations personnel do not want to overemphasize this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Government Sympathetic to Germany</h3>
<p>The Austrian government ordered all newspapers last night to maintain a peaceful tone, but allowed them to make moderate pro-German remarks regarding Germany's actions. Political circles in Vienna also welcomed the Austrian government's decision to welcome Germany's resolution and plan to implement compulsory military service in Austria in the autumn. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Polish Political Circles Worried</h3>
<p>Germany's actions have caused alarm in political circles in Warsaw, who believe this is a natural result of the Anglo-French declaration of February 3. The Anglo-French declaration mentioned the abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and now Hitler is presenting the fait accompli to the great powers, and it is expected that the great powers will try to recognize Germany's actions as legal. The opposition believes that if Europe is united, it can send a joint ultimatum to Berlin and then occupy German territory to punish its disregard for treaties as waste paper. However, since Europe is not united, the signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles may have to compromise to resolve the issue. Although there is a non-aggression treaty between Germany and Poland, it seems that it can protect Poland from German aggression for the next ten years, but the opposition cannot help but doubt whether this treaty will not be regarded as another piece of waste paper by Germany.

<h3>Moscow Astonished by the News</h3>
<p>(Moscow) People here were shocked after the news of Germany's restoration of compulsory military service arrived, and they all believed that the National Socialist government had repeatedly committed major errors, and this was one of them. Germany's insatiable demands are surging, and only a joint effort by the signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles can stabilize world opinion. People here are eager to know what attitude the British government will take on this matter, and whether Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany will be postponed indefinitely. As for Russia's attitude towards various security pacts, it does not intend to change it. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>US Does Not Want to Intervene in European Affairs</h3>
<p>(Washington) Political circles here are very concerned about Germany's resolution to reimplement compulsory military service, saying that Germany's move violates the German-American Treaty of 1921, as the treaty also contains clauses restricting German armaments in Section V of the Treaty of Versailles. It is noted that the United States did not sign the Treaty of Versailles. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Hull refused to express his opinion. The government also appears deeply alarmed, but at least for the time being, it will regard this matter as a local European affair, which has little to do with the United States and can be handled by European countries themselves. Observers say that the clauses of the Treaty of Versailles that limit German armaments are also contained in the US-German Treaty, but the US State Department is unlikely to insist that Germany strictly abide by them. Senior US Army and Navy officers said that Germany's move has rebuilt the balance of power in Europe, which is quite similar to the situation in 1914. A military leader said, "Germany's establishment of conscription is a natural result. This has been going on secretly for a long time, and now it is just a public declaration."

<h3>Japanese Authorities Watch from Afar</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received the official telegram from the German government declaring the abandonment of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles as of noon today. However, the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believe that this issue has a huge impact on the European political situation and are unwilling to express any opinions. However, since Japan is a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany should give a formal notification of the abandonment of the military clauses. At that time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will decide its attitude, but for the time being, it will observe the changes quietly. However, the authorities' views are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The German government's declaration yesterday was unexpected and will of course cause great shock to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. However, Germany has often expressed dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles for many years and has also advocated autonomous disarmament at general disarmament conferences and withdrew from the League of Nations as a result, so it is expected that it will take this action soon. Moreover, Germany has openly engaged in expanding its air force, and the appointment of Goering as Minister of Aviation on the 12th is actually a declaration of abandoning the military clauses. (1) This matter is essentially a European issue, but it concerns all signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles, so if all signatory countries must negotiate, Japan may also participate. (1) Germany's expansion of armaments will inevitably have a significant impact on Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, so the European political situation will inevitably become more difficult in the future.

<p>Newspaper Reviews from Various Countries</p>
<h3>Germany's Mask Completely Removed</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet newspapers carried Germany's declaration with the headline "Germany Breaks the Treaty of Versailles." The Russian Industrialization newspaper said that this matter is important and cannot be ignored. Germany has removed its mask. It also said that Germany insists on rearming with Russia, but it should be known that Russia's increase in its military strength is due to the National Socialist Party's grip on power in Germany, and Hitler's writings recognize declaring war on Russia as the foundation of its policy.

<h3>Collective Security System Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>(London) Newspapers published Germany's abolition of the Treaty of Versailles in fonts similar to those used in advertisements. The initial comments in the newspapers clearly wanted to slightly reduce the severity of this event. The Sunday Times stated, "The question that should be raised at the moment is whether the Berlin talks between British and German cabinet members will be beneficial. Although it is regrettable if this talk has to be postponed again, this is perhaps inevitable and expected. In that case, the planned collective security system will inevitably feel threatened."

<h3>Germany Bears Responsibility for Violating Public Reason</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Neue Wiener Tagblatt commented on Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the treaty, saying, "This is probably the biggest event in Europe since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles," and said that Germany bears a major responsibility for violating public reason. The newspaper's correspondent in Berlin declared that after Germany restores compulsory military service, its professional army should still be maintained. "Germany will now have two types of armies and will become one of the most powerful countries in Europe." The newspaper also said, "The German people can vent their resentment in national jubilation because of the restoration of compulsory military service, and the huge military expenditure spent by the German government can at least be ignored by the people at the moment."

<p>(The Hague) People in financial and business circles here are paying close attention to the monetary situation in Belgium and hope that the talks between Belgium and France can have good results, so that Belgium will not be forced to abandon the gold standard.

It is generally believed that France will be able to provide loans to Belgium to assist it and establish an agreement to protect the currencies of the countries in the gold standard group.

<h3>German Government Plans Large-Scale Civilian Housing Project, Seeking Simple and Practical Housing to Benefit Laborers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Ministry of Labor recently announced a large-scale government plan to universally build houses for workers across the country. The general idea is that laborers who are healthy and valuable to serving the masses should have the opportunity to have a self-built house. The method is for the government to provide subsidies, but the person building the house must have a state-fixed job and be able to raise 20% of the cost themselves. The main characteristics of these buildings are simplicity and practicality, and low cost. All other external decorations that increase the cost are currently abandoned, and the most important point is that each house must be built on at least 1,000 square meters of self-owned land. If the land is fertile, it can be reduced to 600 square meters. In this worker colonial area, the arrangement of each family should enable them to grow most of their food themselves, and there should be a certain place for raising livestock, so that the surplus food can be used to feed livestock, and material resources will not be wasted. Furthermore, workers living in this type of house can also be given the necessary instructions and training by the government authorities first, so that they can follow the procedures of a new life. The recent facilities of the Brunswick Municipal Authority are a good example of the German worker housing movement. About a year ago, Brunswick lacked about 2,000 civilian houses. In 1933, the Brunswick City Hall felt that the residents were crowded and the living conditions were unsanitary, which was detrimental to the health of the people, so it began to prepare to allocate public funds to build civilian houses. Now, there are 1,500 civilian houses in the suburbs of Brunswick that are about to be completed, some with four families living together, and some with one family living alone, but each house must have a space around it for planting and raising animals.

<h3>Beijing Lawyers Association Advocates Abolishing Special Criminal Laws</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Lawyers Association believes that the new Criminal Law has been announced by the National Government and will be implemented on July 1 this year. However, the government has not yet ordered the abolition of the special criminal laws promulgated by the previous government, such as the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China, the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits, and the Anti-Smoking Law. In the future, there will be many conflicts between the implementation of the new Criminal Law and the special criminal laws, and there will also be many obstacles to the unification of criminal law. The Shanghai Lawyers Association has recently decided to petition the Ministry of Justice to submit it to the Central Government to abolish the special criminal laws before the implementation of the Criminal Law. This proposal is very proper. On the 17th, it telegraphed the Shanghai Lawyers Association and fully agreed with this and requested a joint petition. (Special Telegram on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing Suggests Opinions on Migrating to and Cultivating the Northwest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zhu Jiqing suggests opinions on migrating to and cultivating the Northwest: (1) Solve the land problem. For example, the land in Suiyuan, Baotou, Wuyuan, Linhe, and Anbei counties covers an area of more than 636,000 hectares, but only 10,000 hectares have been cultivated, and the rest are all wilderness, with plenty of room for migrant farmers. However, the land rights are mostly controlled by special forces. Among them, those so-called (land with a name attached) only hold an official district document and do not pay any fees, which means they occupy a certain amount of wasteland. If others want to buy and cultivate it, they must pay a high price. (Land with a name attached) must be thoroughly canceled, and progressive taxes should be levied annually if it is not cultivated by the deadline. (2) Abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. There are more than 20 types of donations and taxes in Suiyuan, and there are even temporary apportionments, which should be completely exempted. (3) Unify water conservancy. Suiyuan's water conservancy administration is not unified, and river opening and excavation are carried out without any plan. The collection of fees and water supply also lack standards, and the water conservancy administration must be unified as soon as possible. (4) Group immigration. Soviet Russia immigrates to the Far East, and Japan immigrates to Manchuria, both adopting group policies, and the results are quite remarkable. It seems that this can be imitated. (5) Management of the cultivated area. The management rights should be held by the local authorities or directly under the jurisdiction of the central government. (Special Telegram on the 17th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Water Conservancy Expert Goode Surveys the Golden Embankment of the Yellow River, Planning Repairs to Avoid Accidents</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The situation of the Yellow River in Guantai, southern Hebei, is becoming increasingly urgent. The breach cannot be closed for a long time, and seven-tenths of the flow is rushing away. The main river water is almost completely taken away. The leaked water flows eastward along the Jin Embankment River, and re-enters the main river at Taochengbu in Shandong. Since the Guantai breach is currently difficult to close, and the flood season is approaching, it may become even more difficult. The Jin Embankment in Puyang, Fan County, and Shouzhang and other counties in this province are mostly low and weak. If there is a large flood this year and they cannot withstand it, once there is a breach, the Yellow River will flood northward, not only will northern Shandong face the danger of land submersion, but it may also seize the Grand Canal and go straight to Tianjin. The consequences are too horrible to contemplate. Now, the Gongzhen Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee is supervising the Hebei River Affairs Bureau to speed up the closure of the breach. In addition, the Economic Committee has consulted with League of Nations water conservancy expert Goode to come to Shandong again to survey the Jin Embankment River in order to repair the embankment and plan for it as early as possible. Goode previously came east along the Yellow River from Hebei and Henan to inspect the lower reaches of the Yellow River in this province. He was accompanied by Pan Yifen, the engineering section chief of the River Affairs Bureau. Pan is very familiar with the river works situation, so Goode requested to invite Pan Yifen to go with him. Qin Fen, the Secretary-General of the Economic Committee, sent a special telegram to the Provincial Government, requesting the River Affairs Bureau to inform Pan. Today (14th), the Provincial Government has instructed the River Affairs Bureau to comply. Goode departed from Nanjing on the 13th and is expected to arrive in Jinan today. Within a day or two, he will travel west along the river to Taochengbu, and inspect the Jin Embankment to Huaxian. However, this province is currently preparing to survey the Yellow River estuary. Song Wentian from the Construction Department and Pan Yifen from the River Affairs Bureau are scheduled to depart tomorrow. If Pan accompanies Goode to survey the Jin Embankment, then the estuary survey team will face twists and turns. How to handle it is still undecided. The Provincial Government's instructions to the River Affairs Bureau are recorded below: "It has been approved that the National Economic Commission's Secretary-General Qin Jia telegraphed, stating that the Yellow River breach urgently needs to be remedied, and instructed League of Nations water conservancy commissioner Goode to depart from Nanjing to Jinan on the first day of this month, intending to accompany Pan Yifen, the section chief of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, to survey the Jin Embankment to Huaxian along the way. Please inform Section Chief Pan to act accordingly, and order the subordinates to provide protection along the way, etc. As approved, in addition to replying by telegram and sending separate telegrams to the county magistrates along the way for protection, it is hereby ordered that the director of the bureau forward this order to the section chief for compliance. This order."</p>

<h3>Japanese Suddenly Prohibit Chinese from Leaving the Pass, Over a Thousand Travelers Blocked in Jinzhou, Same Incident Occurs at Gubeikou</h3>
<p>The Reason is Still Unclear</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Direct train service between Beiping and Shenyang was restored on July 1st last year, and it has been seven months and a half since then. Because of convenient transportation, there are many passengers traveling between inside and outside the pass. Judging from the commissions earned by the Oriental Travel Agency, which is responsible for this matter, in addition to regular expenses, it can earn a monthly profit of about 10,000 yuan, which is enough to prove the large number of passengers traveling back and forth. Since the agency was changed to be operated by private individuals from both sides, there was once a widespread rumor outside that it would purchase additional vehicles to expand its business. Although there has been no news of this recently, Zhang Yongqi, the manager of the agency, is constantly busy between Beiping and Jinzhou or Jinzhou and Shenyang, almost without time to rest. People generally have a considerable estimate of the agency's future development, believing that the railway transportation between Beiping and Shenyang will improve further in the near future, which may not be known. Unexpectedly, things have turned out to be very different. Just as the Japanese side, while the Oriental Travel Agency was struggling to operate, suddenly and absolutely prohibited Chinese people from leaving the pass starting on the day before yesterday (14th). When the news came, everyone felt that the matter was strange and unusual, or not a fact. It was not until today (16th) that it was confirmed to be half true. The so-called half is that the parties concerned still deny it. The following is based on the statements of some passengers who returned to Beiping from Jinzhou this morning (16th) as evidence. They departed from Beiping on the Beiping-Shenyang direct train at 8:15 p.m. the day before yesterday (14th) and arrived at Jinzhou Pass yesterday morning (15th). There were more than 500 passengers on the train leaving the pass. According to past practice, in addition to first and second class passengers, third class passengers, regardless of men, women, old, or young, must purchase a so-called "entry permit" from the Datong Company before being allowed to pass. The permit was initially sold for 30 cents of foreign currency, then rose to one yuan, and recently rose to one yuan and thirty cents. Passengers leaving the pass are happy to buy it in order to avoid trouble on the way.</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday (14th), the Datong Company has been ordered to stop selling "entry permits". Even if someone is willing to spend three or four yuan, they cannot buy one. As a result, passengers leaving the pass on the day before yesterday (14th) and yesterday (15th) were blocked at Jinzhou Pass. Not only were the passengers on the Beiping-Shenyang train affected, but also the passengers who changed trains in Jinzhou to leave the pass were subject to the same restriction. Most of the blocked passengers were poor farmers leaving the pass to make a living, or compatriots from outside the pass returning to their homeland. After being blocked, those with sufficient funds stayed in hotels and tried to find a way to dredge relations. Ordinary poor farmers had to sleep in secluded alleys. In the past three days, the number of passengers staying in Jinzhou has exceeded one thousand. As for the fares for the sections outside the pass that have already been paid, the Oriental Travel Agency will refund them in full at any time, without making things difficult. Because they cannot be confined to their residences, they have returned first. The reason why the Japanese are prohibiting Chinese from leaving the pass has not yet been clarified as of the time of writing. The reporter inquired with transportation circles this afternoon (16th), but there was no result. It is said that the railway bureau has not received official information about the incident of Chinese passengers being unable to leave the pass. It is also said that judging by common sense, the resumption of through train service between Beiping and Shenyang was originally at the request of the Japanese side to seek the welfare of the people inside and outside the pass. If the Japanese really do not allow the people inside the pass to leave, what is the purpose of this through train service? Therefore, it is believed that the various rumors are unreliable, etc.</p>
<p>All parties are surprised by this issue and speculate a lot. However, before the facts can be thoroughly proven, it is not appropriate to be assertive. However, it seems to be a fact that the Japanese are prohibiting Chinese from going to the Northeast to make a living so that they can immigrate as much as possible from their country to the four eastern provinces. At the same time, the same incident occurred at Gubeikou. According to someone from a long-distance bus company operating between Beiping and Gubeikou, every spring, poor farmers from provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan form teams to leave Gubeikou and go to Rehe to make a living. After the fall of Rehe, the Japanese imposed a "entry permit" fee of one yuan on poor farmers leaving the pass at Gubeikou. Several batches have been released this spring, but the original ban was suddenly imposed on the day before yesterday (14th), and the so-called "entry permit" was also discontinued, causing poor farmers who have arrived at Gubeikou in recent days to be trapped there, in a difficult situation. The reporter later inquired with a relevant party, who only replied with one sentence: "We have not received a report here."</p>
<p>In summary, it is not yet possible to prove whether the blocking of poor farmers at Gubeikou and the prohibition of passengers from leaving the pass at Jinzhou have the same effect. However, if this problem is not resolved, the through train service between Beiping and Shenyang will be considerably affected, which may be unexpected. (16th)</p>
<h3>Jiang Dingwen Arrives in Xiamen, Talks About Meeting Doihara and Doihara's Expression, Incorporating Local Militias as Essential Plan for Organizing Fujian</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Director stationed in Fujian, went to Nanjing to visit Chairman Jiang at the end of January after the establishment of the Pacification Headquarters and returned to his hometown of Zhuji. On March 12th, he took the Shanghai-Guangdong plane south back to Fujian and arrived in Fuzhou at noon to meet with Provincial Chairman Chen Yi to discuss the issue of incorporating local militias. Coincidentally, Doihara, the special service chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived in Fuzhou from Guangzhou on the 13th and visited Jiang on the 14th. On the 15th, Jiang took the Shanghai-Guangdong plane and arrived in Xiamen at 12 noon. Those who took a motorboat to the aircraft floating station to greet him included Li Jianai, the Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, Li Yannian, the commander of the Ninth Division and Southern District Pacification Commander, Wang Gupan, the Director of the Xiamen Special Public Security Bureau, Dai Ensai, the Customs Superintendent, Zhu Pingzhi, the Director of the Xiamen Office of the Pacification Headquarters, and Chen Fuheng, the Manager of the Xiamen Branch of the Central Bank. After Jiang got off the plane, he took a motorboat to Gulangyu and returned to his private residence below Flag Hill. At 2 p.m., he met with reporters from various newspapers for a conversation. The questions and answers are as follows: (Question) Director Jiang met with Doihara in the province. May I ask what Doihara's expression on Sino-Japanese amity was? (Answer) The general idea is nothing more than explaining the international situation, hoping that the upper and lower levels of China and Japan can unite sincerely to cope with the world crisis and jointly seek East Asian peace. Doihara also said that he had met with Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, Chen Bonan in Guangzhou, and Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng in Guilin, and the talks were very satisfactory. Doihara also greatly praised the construction of Guangxi, saying that his impression of the southern tour was very good. (Question) What is Director Jiang's opinion on the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation? (Answer) If Japan is truly sincere and does not violate the principle of equality and mutual assistance, China has always longed for peace, and I am no different. (Question) Director Jiang must have an overall plan for suppressing the remaining bandits and incorporating local militias in this province. May I ask to hear a general outline? (Answer) Incorporating local militias is my firm proposition since I entered Fujian. If this goal is not achieved, I would rather not do it. Without this, all political, economic, and productive construction in Fujian cannot be started. I believe that incorporating local militias is the fundamental plan for organizing Fujian. Even from the perspective of the government itself, the Fujian militias have always followed in all revolutions. How can they be recruited when needed and dismissed when not needed? I went to Nanjing this time specifically to ask Chairman Jiang for instructions on this matter, and I hope that they can all come back together to serve the country. From now on, there will be no more word of suppression. This is not only a blessing for the country, but also for Fujian. As for the funds for incorporation, the central government has promised to subsidize a part, and the provincial government is also raising a part. In the future, the regular expenses will be handled in the same way as in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, by allocating additional amounts from the province's original donations and taxes. On the surface, this move will inevitably increase the burden on the people, but in reality, it is not. Without this, there would be no way to get the funds, the incorporation would not be realized, and the militias would have no way out. They would still occupy land as heroes, set up checkpoints to collect taxes, and disturb the local people. The people's losses would be even greater than this. Rather than disturbing the people without incorporation, it would be better to slightly increase the burden, so that it can be widespread and security can be seized. Then, all reorganization can be expected. However, once this move is implemented, the people may inevitably have critical words for me, but for the sake of the entire future of Fujian, I only seek to benefit the country and benefit the people. I am willing to endure hardship and bear resentment. As for suppressing the remaining bandits, it is my responsibility. The entire bandit army has already collapsed. It is not difficult to eliminate the minor diseases in a short period of time, etc. Jiang was still in Gulangyu on the 16th and will return to Tianjin today (17th) or tomorrow (18th). The memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the former Eastern Route Army who died in the suppression of rebellion is scheduled for the 20th, and Jiang will preside over it. (March 17th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Militia Being Incorporated</h3>
<p>Team Reorganization Office Established, Over 20 Units Have Applied for Incorporation, Approximately 30,000 People and Guns</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Director of Fujian Province, and Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, discussed and decided on a plan to incorporate the province's militias. Jiang went to Nanjing to visit Chairman Jiang and obtained approval, and the Military Affairs Commission provided a monthly subsidy of 60,000 yuan. The Pacification Headquarters has sent personnel and the Provincial Government has sent personnel from the Security Department to set up a joint office in Zhangzhou to start working, named the "Joint Office for Team Reorganization." As of March 15th, more than 20 units of local militias have come to apply for incorporation. The number of people and guns is being tallied in the registration forms. The total number of more than 20 units is approximately 30,000 people and guns. However, only the units of Zhan Fangzhen, Cao Jiayan, and Sun Guangming have been approved by the office to send personnel for inspection. The others are still under review. In addition, the organizational outline of the "Joint Office for Team Reorganization" jointly formed by the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government was announced by the Pacification Headquarters on the 14th as follows: 1. The Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government have specially established this office for the convenience of implementing the reorganization of security teams and for rapid handling. 2. This office will be temporarily located in Zhangzhou. 3. This office is directly under the Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters. 4. The tasks of this office, in addition to reorganizing in accordance with the provisions of the Fujian Security Team Reorganization Plan, are generally as follows: (A) Organize and reorganize all local armed forces. Detailed rules for organization and reorganization will be formulated separately in the reorganization plan. The personnel, management, education, and administration of the local armed forces after organization and reorganization will still be handled by the Security Department. (B) Plan to reorganize the province's existing teams, to be executed by the Security Department. 5. This office will have one director and one deputy director, to be jointly appointed by the Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters. 6. This office will be temporarily divided into three groups: A. General Affairs Group, composed of five to seven members, responsible for handling documents, general affairs, and matters not belonging to other groups. B. Reorganization Group, composed of thirteen to fifteen members, responsible for matters such as inspection, reorganization, and training. C. Management Group, composed of five to seven members, responsible for the management of this office and the management of teams during the inspection and reorganization period. The above-mentioned personnel will be seconded from the Provincial Government's Security Department, Finance Department, and the Pacification Headquarters' staff, deputy, finance, and medical departments. 7. The reorganization period of this office is tentatively set at six months, after which it will be closed.</p>
<p>As for the candidates for the director and deputy director of the joint office, the Pacification Headquarters originally appointed Yu Nianci, the staff officer of the Provincial Security Department, as the director, and Li Jianai, the chief of staff of the Pacification Headquarters, as the deputy. However, Provincial Chairman Chen Yi strongly advocated for Li Jianai as the director and Yu Nianci as the deputy, so it has not been decided yet. Jiang Dingwen's visit to the province this time should be able to decide it, and the announcement will be made within days. As for the group leaders, Yang Yongli, the director of the Pacification Headquarters' adjutant office, has been internally appointed as the head of the General Affairs Group, Xu Lian, the counselor of the Provincial Government, has been appointed as the head of the Reorganization Group, and the head of the Management Group has not yet been decided.

<h3>Li Liejun Arrives in Tai'an to Meet Feng in Detail, Scheduled to Come to Jinan on the Seventeenth to Meet Han and Then Go to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, came to Shandong last year to visit and meet his old friend Feng Yuxiang, a member of the Central Committee, and Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. They had a pleasant conversation about old times and were very happy. After returning south, he traveled between Guangdong and Fujian, working for national affairs, and did not come north again. Recently, after Mr. Li arrived in Nanjing, he met with important figures of the central government and discussed national affairs, but rarely expressed his opinions to the outside world. After finishing his business in Nanjing, Mr. Li planned a trip to Qingdao, so he came north to Shandong from Nanjing on the 15th. He visited Feng Yuxiang and Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, because of their close personal relationships, so he made a detour on the way to Tai'an and Jinan to visit them, purely for a friendly visit and with no other mission. According to a long-distance telephone report from Tai'an, today (16th) at 5 a.m., Mr. Li Liejun arrived in Tai'an from Nanjing on the Tianjin-Pukou express train. Mr. Feng Yuxiang, a member of the Central Committee, had received a telegram in advance and sent a representative, accompanied by Zhou Baihuang, the magistrate of Tai'an County, and Bin Zhaokang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, to welcome him at the station. After Mr. Li got off the train, he exchanged greetings with the welcomers and then took a mountain sedan chair with Feng's representative to visit Feng. He arrived at the Five Sages Shrine at 6 a.m., and Feng welcomed him outside the shrine. After meeting, they shook hands and entered together. Feng was still wearing blue cloth clothes and pants, and his spirit was very good. They talked in Feng's newly built study, sharing their stories and having a very happy conversation. In the afternoon, they toured the mountain scenery. Mr. Li stayed at the Five Sages Shrine that night. It is said that Li is scheduled to leave for Jinan tomorrow (17th) to meet with Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and then return to Qingdao. (17th)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the River Dredging Dispute Between Xiao and Su Counties</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: A conflict arose between Xiao and Su counties regarding the dredging of the Kui River. On the 4th and 5th of this month, a day and night of armed conflict occurred. Afterwards, the county's armed forces retreated to Su territory, while the people of Xiao continued to dredge the river under the protection of their armed forces. Shao Hanyuan, the special commissioner of the Tongshan area, personally inspected the area on the 7th and also sent Yu Keyu, the section chief of the special commissioner's office, to Su to negotiate. By yesterday (the 14th), Lu Peizhang, the special commissioner of the Anhui-Si area, came to Xuzhou and, after consulting with Special Commissioner Shao, a complete resolution was reached. The case originated as a conflict between the people of Xiao and Su. After returning to Su, the people of Su, unable to stop the people of Xiao from dredging the river, dug up the Baishantou River Dam below Fenghuangdan in Su territory and released water eastward to irrigate Xiao territory. However, the released water had to pass through Su territory before entering Xiao, and the area receiving water in Xiao was very small, with the downstream flowing into Lingbi. As soon as the people of Su on the west bank of the Kui River dug the dam, before releasing the water, they were met with opposition from the people of Su on the east bank of the Kui River, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. The rumor of a second armed conflict between Xiao and Su was actually due to internal strife among the people of Su. After the conflict between Xiao and Su, the special commissioner's office sent Yu Keyu to Su, who, witnessing the situation with so many complications, returned to Xuzhou to report. The Si area special commissioner's office also sent water conservancy commissioner Wang Zhiquan to Su to inspect the rivers. There was no way to resolve the long-standing local disputes. Lu Peizhang, the special commissioner of the Si area, personally traveled from Si to Su and, together with Chen Xuexiang, the construction section chief of Su county, water conservancy commissioner Zhang Fangqiao, and commissioner Wang Zhiquan, took the Jinpu train from Su to Xuzhou on the evening of the 13th. After getting off the train, they immediately visited Shao Hanyuan at the Tongshan area special commissioner's office. After a meeting, their opinions were very close, and they decided to adopt the principle of jointly completing the dredging of the Kui River by all parties. On the morning of the 14th, Shao, accompanied by Tongshan County Magistrate Wang Gongwu, consulted with Lu again. In the afternoon, they held another discussion and decided on the following general measures: (1) Tongshan, Xiao, Su, and Lingbi counties in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces should take the completion of the Kui River dredging as the principle for resolving the issue. (2) Special Commissioner Lu is responsible for supervising the people of Su and Lingbi counties to continue dredging the Kui River, starting from Fenghuangdan and guiding it along the original course into the Sui River, so that it can flow into Hongze Lake and discharge into the Huai River. (3) Su county will immediately stop opening the Baishan Dam, and Lu has issued an order to stop it. (4) When necessary for the dredging of the Kui River in Su county, Tongshan and Xiao will provide appropriate assistance. (5) Tongshan, Xiao, Su, and Lingbi counties should restore neighborly relations and not harbor animosity in the future, resolving past grievances. (6) In the future, if floods occur on the border between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, they should jointly find ways to provide relief, led by the two special commissioners and jointly managed by officials and people from the two areas. Lu obtained this result and took the Jinpu train back to Su that evening. Special Commissioner Shao saw him off at the station, and the conversation was extremely harmonious. The original proposal of Su county to excavate the Baiyan Mountain project and the Kui River dredging project in Xiao county should be stopped at the appropriate time. However, in reality, the river dredging project in Xiao county is nearing completion, so Su county has no other option but to speed up the continuation of dredging. The Tongshan area project has also been mostly completed. Since the commencement of work in Tongshan county on the 8th, 30,000 laborers have been employed daily. It is estimated that it will be completed in two weeks. Taking advantage of the moonlight, they are working day and night because the people have suffered from floods for a long time and feel the urgent need for river dredging. It is said that Lu plans to order the commencement of continuation dredging immediately after arriving in Su. Thus, the water conservancy dispute on the border between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, which has lasted for more than a hundred years, has been completely resolved. In the future, sails and masts will be able to travel upstream along the Kui River and dock directly on the shores of Yunlong.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Decline in Qingdao's Peanut and Oil Prices</h3>
<p>Accumulated Spot Goods Valued at Approximately Ten Million Yuan, Foreign and Southern Merchants Stop Buying</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Qingdao's peanuts and peanut oil are a major export commodity, with an annual value of more than 40 million yuan. After the initial launch of peanuts and peanut oil last winter, market prices gradually rose. Local merchants in the city actively stored spot goods, hoping to make huge profits. Unexpectedly, since the Lantern Festival after the abolition of the lunar calendar, market prices have gradually declined, with peanuts falling from 8.55 yuan to 6.10 yuan (per 100 catties). According to the investigation, the reasons for the price decline are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Stop Buying</p>
<p>Last winter, due to the poor global agricultural harvests and lack of oils, foreign merchants in Qingdao made advance purchases, starting to buy in October in preparation for shipping to Europe and the West between March and April of this year. Therefore, peanut prices rose. Since the new year, foreign merchants have been satiated and have stopped buying to watch the market, so the spot goods stored by merchants have no buyers. Foreign merchants account for 75% of Qingdao's peanut trade, so since they have stopped buying, market prices have inevitably fallen. This is an important reason.</p>
<p>Silver Expensive, Gold Cheap</p>
<p>Foreign merchants have a wait-and-see attitude towards spot goods, and also because silver has become expensive and gold cheap in recent months, the foreign exchange rate has increased daily, making exporters feel difficult. For example, the selling price of the Sino-British shilling was 14 and 7/8 on January 8, but rose to 18 and 13/16 on the 4th of this month. Furthermore, the Sino-Japanese gold ticket was 124 yuan on the same day, but also rose to 114 yuan. According to this calculation, the difference of about 20 yuan per 100 yuan is a major blow to Chinese exports.</p>
<p>Financial Crisis</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sino-Western banking sector, which holds financial power, has adopted a tight policy since the end of last year. Industrial and commercial credit has contracted, and turnover is difficult. Since Shanghai is like this, other ports have been affected. Qingdao's exporters have spot goods in hand, but because of the tight money supply, they have to sell them urgently.</p>
<p>Southern Merchants Watching</p>
<p>In addition to the bulk of Qingdao's peanuts being purchased by foreign merchants, the Guang merchant group comes first, followed by the Nan, Yong, Min, and Han port merchants. Since the Shanghai money supply is so tight, the Guang merchant group's flow of funds has been limited. Furthermore, since the amount of Guangdong clear oil has decreased, there is no trading to speak of. Since the purchase of goods is not enthusiastic, imports have also decreased. Most of the stored spot goods are entrusted to futures, and the future lack of people to collect the goods is also a major cause of the price decline.</p>
<p>Spot Goods Concentrated</p>
<p>Since the exchange can entrust out futures, those who store spot goods rush to sell them. The long-term is to save the temporary loss. Moreover, last winter rose sharply, and foreign merchants all wanted to occupy odd goods and store more spot goods, waiting for the rise this spring. Now that it is falling by the thousands of feet, large households sell it off, and market prices must fall. Furthermore, in the Henan area, Guangdong and Hankou merchants have gone to buy spot goods for many years. Now that no one is asking for them, the accumulated rice and oil are shipped by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's merchant ships from Lianyungang, which will come to Qingdao in huge quantities every day and sell them to the exchange's futures to prepare for delivery. This is because Qingdao's exchange is the only outlet for peanuts in North China. According to yesterday's survey, there are approximately 750,000 bags of peanuts stored in Qingdao, totaling approximately 135 million market catties, valued at 8.1 million yuan at yesterday's market price. There are approximately 900 peanut oil carts stored, totaling 11.7 million market catties, valued at approximately 1.52 million yuan. With such a huge amount of goods accumulated in Qingdao, when the April period is approaching, who will collect the remaining 8,000 tons of futures in the exchange? Moreover, with the weather warming up, it cannot be stored for long. How can more than 10 million market catties of oil be sold? The future is a pessimist's expectation.</p>
<p>Lack of Relief</p>
<p>The banking sector and industry and commerce are already in a season of taking care of themselves, and the price ratio of gold and silver has no great power to recover. Yesterday, peanuts had fallen to 6.10 yuan, which is more than twice the lowest price of 3.20 yuan two years ago (3.80 yuan per old scale combined market scale). This is only 2.70 yuan lower than the highest price of 8.80 yuan two years ago. How can the market price be raised without a huge amount of cash to store?</p>
<p>European Market Weak</p>
<p>Last winter, the market price of Chinese peanuts in London rose from 9 shillings (the price of 100 catties for delivery in London) to 15 shillings and 3 pence and 3/4ths. Now, it is declining daily and has fallen to 12 shillings and 8 pence and 1/2. From this, it can be seen that Europe and the West are now gradually weakening, local Western merchants cannot ship goods, transactions are cold, and the market price is bound to fall.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Three Homes Robbed in Yangjiadai</h3>
<p>Yangjiadai in Fengjing Twenty-ninth ward, where farmers Dai Shiqing, Dai Quanfa, and Dai Gaofa live as neighbors in the same village. On the night of the 15th of this month, at about 11:00 p.m., seven or eight robbers speaking local dialect suddenly came, holding wooden sticks and shoulder poles. They first went to Dai Shiqing's house, smashed the gate, and entered, tied up the victim, prohibited him from making noise, and then entered the room to search for valuables, taking away four bolts of white cloth, sixteen bolts of blue cloth, a pair of two-qian gold bracelets, and a leather Mandarin jacket. After looting, the bandits went to Dai Quanfa's and Dai Gaofa's homes to search for valuables, carrying the loot and whistling out the gate, fleeing to the north.</p>
<h3>Director of Relief Agency Negatively Resigns</h3>
<p>The county relief agency was established last year by provincial order, and a year has passed. The businesses it has run, including vocational training centers, poverty relief centers, material distribution, and burial, have been established in sequence. Currently, it is also planning women's training centers and infant nurseries, which will also be realized soon. However, the director of the agency, Li Zuhua, has recently been in poor spirits and has expressed his intention to resign to his superiors. It is not known whether the authorities will approve it.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: The New Life Movement Inspection Group Visits Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Nanchang New Life Movement General Association inspection group, Xu Qingyu, Lin Xueyan, Zhang Yuchong, and Yu Zhongqi, arrived in Suzhou by train from Wuxi at about 9:00 p.m. on the 16th. County Magistrate Wu and others went to the station to greet them and accompanied them into the city. At the park library, they gathered the responsible persons of various agencies to talk. They stayed in the library that night. Yesterday (the 17th), at 8:00 a.m., they were divided into two groups. The first group, Zhang Yuchong, led by County Magistrate Wu and Special Commissioner Sun, inspected various agencies. The second group, Lin Xueyan and Yu Zhongqi, led by Director Peng of the Education Bureau and Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau, inspected schools and streets. At 1:00 p.m., they gathered the principals of various schools in Zhongshan Hall for a speech. In the afternoon, at 4:00 p.m., they left Suzhou for Kunshan, and then went to Shanghai for inspection.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on the Private Sale of Counterfeit Money Agencies</h3>
<p>The Hetaichang Tobacco Exchange Store at No. 77 Damalu Road outside the gate was engaged in the side business of selling fake foreign coins and inferior copper coins. This was discovered by Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau. At about 3:00 p.m. on the 16th, he sent Inspector Tao Shiheng to lead police officers disguised as customers to buy counterfeit money as an excuse. After obtaining conclusive evidence, they implemented a search. More than 20 counterfeit banknotes of various denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan from the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Zhongnan Bank, as well as more than 140 inferior coins, were seized. The store owner, Ji Haoru, and apprentice, Wang Genfa, were arrested. A search of the Xingchang Tobacco Exchange Store at Guangji Bridge revealed dozens of yuan of counterfeit money and counterfeit foreign coins. It was also discovered that the counterfeit money was manufactured by Wang Baisheng, who lived at No. 5 Gusheng Lane. However, Wang had already fled upon hearing the news. The witnesses were transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation by Section Chief Zhang, who ordered them to be detained. He also ordered the strict arrest of the principal offender, Wang Baisheng, and to be brought to justice for interrogation. The suspects will be sent to the court for investigation today (the 18th).</p>
<h3>Wujiang: The Ministry of Communications Takes Over Commercial Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Pingwang Telegraph and Telephone Business Office is now ordered by the Ministry to take over the Shengze and Lieli telephone lines. The county chamber of commerce is deeply worried that the Ministry of Communications will take over the Lieli and Shengze telephone lines. The Ministry and provincial telephone lines cannot be connected, causing obstruction. A telegram was sent to the Ministry requesting exemption from the takeover. A reply was received yesterday, stating that the Ministry had already established a telegraph and telephone business office in Pingwang, Wujiang, to facilitate public communication. Now, after the Shengze and Lieli telephone lines are taken back at a price, they will be connected to the Pingwang Business Office, and the Shengze and Lieli commercial companies will also be connected, so that the county areas of Wujiang, Pingwang, Shengze, and Lieli can still be connected and communicate without any obstruction. The request should not be discussed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Cracking Down on Human Trafficking Agencies</h3>
<p>Since the County Public Security Bureau Supervision Office cracked down on the Mazi Mountain and other human trafficking general agencies and the Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and other sub-agencies, human trafficking criminals disappeared for a while. The other day, Inspector Wang received a secret report stating that an old woman from Danyang, Huang Zhao, etc., had set up agencies in Wuxi, Danyang, Shanghai, and other places to traffic in human beings. Recently, they lured two women to Wuxi and opened a room at No. 41 Huizhong Hotel as an agency. Inspector Wang sent inspectors Feng Yimao and clerk Chen Zongshou, disguised as merchants, to stay at the Mengyuan Hotel and find a line to contact them. Huang Zhao came to the Mengyuan Hotel to talk, and also called Huang Guohua (alias Hui Yueqing) and Wu Zhou (alias Li Zizhen) to show the samples. At that time, it was stated that Wu Zhou's price was 160 yuan, and Huang Guohua was a prostitute for three years, with an annual price of 60 yuan. The price of the first two years was paid in advance, and the fortune teller Wang Guanchen wrote the contract of sale, and after the formalities were completed, Huang Guohua, Wu Zhou, Wang Guanchen, and three other people were detained first. At the same time, the principal offender Huang Zhao, and accomplices Wu Yinquan, Xu Xushi, Wang Wushi, Lu Quanlang, Chen Bingsheng, Zhang Liugen, and seven other people were arrested and transferred to the Fang Branch for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony of the New Prison</h3>
<p>The construction of the new prison in this county began on August 1 last year and was completed at the end of December. The internal facilities and layout are well-organized.

<h3>Changzhou: Charity Association Allocates Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>Wu County suffered a drought last year, and the villagers had no savings. In areas such as Butou Town in the ninth district, people are eating tree bark and grass roots. The county disaster relief committee begged for relief from the Shanghai Drought Relief Charity Association and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. The Early Disaster Relief Charity Association approved the allocation of 7,000 yuan, and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association allocated 3,000 yuan, and 12,000 yuan was raised locally to distribute spring relief. The Shanghai Drought Relief Charity Association entrusted Li Tianzhen of the Red Swastika Society to lead a relief team to Changzhou on the 17th. After contacting the disaster relief committee, they went to the disaster area to re-examine the disaster victims and distribute accounts at any time.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Two Patrol Officers Dismissed for Accepting Bribes from Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>Since Qidong was ordered to ban opium, personnel from various agencies have been able to handle it seriously. However, Song Guopei, a patrol officer from the first branch office of the Public Security Bureau, and Hu Huanxue, a patrol officer from the second branch office, have repeatedly been found to be sheltering opium offenders and accepting bribes. This was reported to the Provincial Opium Suppression Committee, which sent personnel to investigate and found it to be true. Yesterday (the 14th), the Qidong County Government was ordered to dismiss and investigate Song and Hu.</p>

<h3>Jiashan: Hangzhou-Jiashan Highway徵工 Construction</h3>
<p>The construction of the highway from Linping to Fengjing in this county has been rumored for a long time. Now it is known that the method of徵工 construction has been decided and implemented. The areas through which the road passes are all disaster areas, and it is urgently necessary to徵工 construction to comply with the principle of work relief. Currently, the wage for each cubic meter of earthwork is 1.2 cents. Based on the calculation of 2.5 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day, each person can earn 3 cents of wages per day. Every 20 people form a group, and a group leader is elected to manage it.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: A Car Accident at Yemaodun</h3>

The old woman was sent to Zhapu Chengji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Group Wedding Ceremony Held</h3>
<p>Twelve women from the Jiliang Institute affiliated to the Provincial and District Relief Institute in Hangzhou have publicly solicited marriages, and nine of them have agreed with each other.

There were also performances by the institute's artists of Red Mane Fierce Horse and various opera fans performing Empty City Plan and Imperial Stele Pavilion, which was very grand.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Bandits Killed Accomplices for Unequal Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>Pan Gongshun, a resident of Panjiagang, Yinxi, started as a farmer and can be called well-fed. Gongshun died of illness in the first month of last year, and his family affairs were handled by his eldest son, Wenming. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 a.m. yesterday, five bandits suddenly came, holding a wooden shell gun and sharp blades. They broke into the door, intimidated them into silence, and ransacked boxes and cabinets, carrying out a large-scale search, looting gold and silver jewelry, bedding, and other items, with a loss of about several hundred yuan. After the bandits finished looting, they passed Yuanzhen Bridge and came to the Yin-Feng Highway. They arrived near the Biao Society bus station and divided the loot on the spot. Later, due to the unequal distribution of the loot, a dispute arose. One bandit was shot by his accomplice, the bullet entered from the back, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The bandits saw that they had caused trouble, so they each held the loot and fled in different directions. Two of the accomplice bandits, Ye A'huo and Lu Wanxing, came to Ningbo. When they were walking near the Yongning Bridge, they were spotted by a police officer from the 1st Branch, who suspected that they were carrying a large number of clothes and walking quickly. He and the police officer intercepted the two bandits and questioned them. They were evasive in their answers. Then, they checked their bags and found men's and women's clothes, jewelry, banknotes, and other items, which were obviously stolen goods. They immediately took the bandits and the stolen goods to the station and transferred them to the branch office for handling.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Set to Go to Sichuan Next Month, First Sends Three Experts to Depart at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the National Economic Commission is actively promoting construction matters in various provinces, sparing no effort. The commission considers Sichuan to be a region endowed by nature, so it intends to find ways to develop the province's resources and various constructions in the shortest possible time. In particular, the construction of the Sichuan-Hubei, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Gansu highways is one of the most urgent tasks.

<h3>New Movement Promotion Service Corps - Second General Mobilization Yesterday</h3>

Since the initial mobilization last Sunday, citizens have gained a deep understanding and knowledge of the New Life Movement. Yesterday, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, they continued to serve on various designated roads.</p>
<p>Corps Leader Inspects</p>

<h3>Money Trade Association Advises Members - To Extend Loans to Industry and Commerce as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Special Committee of the Dili Association decided that the government and the money and banking industries would jointly provide 5 million yuan in small credit loans. Although the Money Trade Association decided not to join the banking syndicate, the government side will continue to organize it in conjunction with the Bankers Association. It is reported that the Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, will convene the financial community to continue discussing the issue of small industrial and commercial credit loans in order to proceed.</p>
<p>Money Trade Maximizes Credit Loans</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the money trade that the lending business of money shops is generally divided into three categories: fixed-term loans, mortgage loans, and current overdrafts. Fixed-term loans are now the four-bottom and ten-bottom loans. Current overdrafts are now the "song zhe fang qin" (submitting account books for loans), which are mainly based on credit. Since the Trade Association decided not to join the industrial and commercial credit small loan banking syndicate, Qin Runqing, the chairman of the association, has instructed the member money shops to expand credit loans to industry and commerce as much as possible to provide relief.</p>
<p>All Shops Offer Factory Loans</p>
<p>Since Fuyuan Money Shop started offering factory loans, other shops have followed suit. The purpose is to mainly assist small industries. The method is that small industrialists, if they have sufficient credit and can prove that they are indeed engaged in industrial development, can mortgage their goods, regardless of the amount, and provide a suitable guarantor. After the shop approves, they can use the goods as collateral for a loan from the shop. Or, with a guarantor approved by the shop, they can establish a current overdraft with the shop without collateral. The interest rate is particularly low.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for Low Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Since the final accounting of the Republic of China in 1934, the daily foreign exchange rates in the money market have consistently been at 8 or 9 fen. The reasons are: (1) Money shops are being cautious about lending due to the sluggish market, resulting in a decrease in interbank lending; (2) Industrial and commercial decline and lack of purchasing power have led to a reduction in the procurement of goods by various industries, eliminating the need for large sums of money; (3) Rural bankruptcy has concentrated cash in Shanghai. Due to the above three issues, foreign exchange rates are not likely to rise sharply in the short term. It is also reported that the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association is scheduled to hold a meeting of officers at the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters meeting room at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants in Hankou - Request Increase in Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat - Letters to Shanghai Organizations Seeking Unified Support</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, five organizations, including the Hankou Grain Trade Association, sent letters to various grain trade organizations in Shanghai yesterday, requesting unanimous support in petitioning the central government to increase the import tax on foreign rice and wheat in order to prevent dumping and protect agricultural products. The original letter stated: Our associations received letters and telegrams from grain trade associations in Hunan, Shanghai, Henan, and Shashi, roughly stating that although some provinces had drought areas after last year's autumn harvest, the two provinces of Hunan and Hubei, which are famous for grain production, actually had harvests of over 70%. Henan and Shaanxi had full harvests. Therefore, the raw materials for wheat flour in Hankou and Henan are entirely supplied by the mainland. Soybean and sesame oilseeds are sufficient to meet the needs. Grain and rice are more than enough to feed the people in Hunan, Hubei and Henan rice and wheat producing areas.</p>
<p>Inexhaustible Sources</p>
<p>As local market prices are gradually improving, grain is between four yuan and rice is eight yuan. Wheat is around four yuan. Our country has transitioned from an era of cheap grain hurting farmers to a period of balanced market prices for food. In the future, if the government can control the import of rice and grain on one hand and encourage merchants to transport and circulate it on the other, then the policies of the government, the Yuan (Executive Yuan), the Ministry (of Industry), and Chairman Chiang in recent years to relieve the countryside will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Unexpectedly, recently, a few Shanghai merchant magnates, in order to pursue their own selfish interests, took advantage of the incomplete national control policy and secretly ordered more than 200,000 tons of foreign wheat and 6 million bags of foreign rice from foreign merchants, totaling approximately 100 million yuan in national currency. On the one hand, foreigners are absorbing a large amount of domestic finance, which clearly violates the national economic policy of valuing money and silver, and creates a source for foreigners to drain a large amount of silver coins, severely harming domestic merchants and farmers to the point of bankruptcy. On the other hand, they are abandoning their own fields and cultivating other people's fields, causing domestic grain to be unsalable and low in price, severely harming the blood and sweat of farmers, and disregarding the painstaking policies to relieve the countryside, pushing</p>
<p>Rural Revival</p>
<p>into a pie in the sky. Therefore, letters and telegrams are pouring in, requesting measures to be taken to stop it and jointly suggesting levying a heavy foreign tax to curb dumping, etc. Last July, our associations jointly petitioned the Dian Yuan Bu (the office of the telegraph administration) to exempt foreign rice purchases to maintain the countryside. Your association forwarded the Dian Yuan Bu to the court for verification and ordered compliance. On October 17th, we received the Finance Ministry's Fu Zi No. 1335 Dian, which stated, "Upon investigation, although someone previously suggested this case, it was not approved. The Executive Yuan has resolved to establish a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau by the government, which will be managed by this ministry and is currently being prepared. There is no need to worry about the Dian." Upon receiving this, it is clear that the government has long been planning. Our associations firmly believe that the government will implement a policy of prohibiting through taxation in its overall planning. However, considering that merchants are only profit-oriented and will seize any opportunity, taking advantage of the government's incomplete facilities and unfulfilled plans, the above-mentioned secret orders are inevitable. Therefore, it is appropriate to truthfully petition for a strict order to stop it, and to petition the relevant ministry and court to</p>
<p>Quickly Increase</p>
<p>the import tax on foreign rice and wheat in order to curb dumping and protect agricultural products. We also earnestly request that before the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau is widely established, all provincial and municipal governments should issue strict orders to all local merchant groups that if they order rice and wheat in the future, they must first register with the government's relevant departments for approval before they can purchase and transport it, so as not to go against the entire policy of relieving the countryside. Therefore, we have sent the above suggestions and telegrams to the industry associations in Shanghai, Henan, Hunan, and Shashi, requesting merchants to discuss and agree, and to submit petitions in different directions, daring to truthfully report this matter by telegram, earnestly requesting verification and approval to separately send telegrams to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, ordering verification and implementation, and issuing an order to comply, not daring to be disrespectful and awaiting orders. Hankou Municipal Miscellaneous Grain Trade Association, Grain Industry Trade Association, Machine Rice Industry Trade Association, Flour Store Industry Trade Association, Hanyang Grain Industry Trade Association, jointly bowing,</p>
<h3>"138" Anniversary Today - City Military and Police Step Up Security</h3>

<h3>China National Anti-Drug Association - Ten Major Propositions for Banning Opium</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the China National Anti-Drug Association on Museum Road in this port recently held a standing committee meeting at the International Hotel to discuss future policies for banning opium and formulated four major principles and a draft declaration. Wang Jingqi, Xue Dubi, Li Denghui, Wu Kaisheng, Chu Fucheng, Zhong Keto, Huang Jiahe, and others were selected to revise the declaration and attach ten major propositions for banning opium. The declaration and its six-year opium banning propositions are attached below. Since the launch of the National Anti-Drug Movement by this association, more than ten years have passed. All of the association's past propositions for banning opium have adhered to Premier Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy and the people's desire to eliminate drugs. Its words and work have been witnessed by the people of the country. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has repeatedly expressed its determination to ban opium, but there have been no concrete measures to ban it. Therefore, this association has united with the people to jointly urge and persist without the slightest懈 (slackening). In the spring of last year, this association submitted a letter to the authorities again, putting forward concrete suggestions for banning opium. Fortunately, they were adopted, which led to the vigorous banning policy. In view of the needs of the times, the colleagues have provided a reference for banning opium based on their research findings, on the one hand, arousing society to jointly promote the realization of the ban, hoping that after six years, the scourge of opium will disappear, the nation will be revived, and the initial foundation will be built. Then the party and the country will be fortunate, and it will not only be fortunate for the opium ban.</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The propositions of this association are summarized in the following major outline: (1) Banning opium should not be for the purpose of income. The current income should be allocated to opium banning facilities, such as education and publicity, opium addiction investigation, and all prevention and remediation equipment. (2) The six-year opium banning plan should be divided into stages. The first stage should prohibit opium planting. The second stage should prohibit opium smoking and use. The third stage should handle the aftermath. (3) Opium planting is prohibited in the ten provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Gansu, and Shaanxi. Except for Shaanxi and Gansu, it has been largely successful. The government should be requested to quickly plan and pay attention to farmers' alternative opium planting crops in order to stop the source and avoid endless harm. (4) The source of opium in North China comes from Jehol and Fujian, and the source of opium comes mostly from Taiwan. The government should be requested to find ways to stop the source to prevent the opium banning plan from being affected. In addition, opium banning in various concessions does not follow our country's laws and regulations. Negotiations should be conducted to unify them in order to achieve practical results. (5) The government is vigorous and resolute in banning potent drugs, but private production and sales still exist everywhere. The reason is that the raw materials used to manufacture drugs are not managed, and pharmacies can obtain them everywhere. The government should pay attention to this. (6) Customs offices in various places burn all drugs seized, as usual, in order to prevent abuses. (7) Zhejiang has the best opium banning results among the ten provinces. The province's single-line opium banning law has fewer abuses. The government should be requested to extend Zhejiang's method to other provinces for easier results. (8) In order to realize the above propositions and achieve the goal of complete opium banning in six years, the government should hire experts in economics, agriculture, finance, opium banning, etc., to be responsible for researching effective opium banning programs, and prevent abuses. The government should submit the facilities for adoption and implementation. (9) Since the capital has been designated as a model opium banning area, various provinces will follow suit. Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners pay attention. It should continue to thoroughly eliminate opium and drugs in order to set an example for the country. (10) The government should cooperate with the people and social organizations to enforce the opium ban in order to assist in areas that the law cannot reach and achieve the practical effect of banning opium.</p>

After much discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the commission fee, as claimed, was 47 cents per pig, which included 10 cents for pre-slaughter inspection, 7 cents for the dock worker's tying fee, 10 cents for dock fees and shop commissions, and 20 cents for transportation, totaling 47 cents. This did not include any taxes. Furthermore, the inspection fee, tying fee, and transportation fees were all advances paid by the traders and had a long history. There was no possibility of any additional increases. Therefore, the result of the discussion was that no reduction was possible. In addition to publishing a rebuttal in the newspaper, a letter was sent to the general association for verification. The meeting adjourned after these matters were discussed, at which time the clock struck six.</p>

<h3>Gaochun Disaster Victims Die After Mistakenly Eating Stone Noodles; Ten Thousand Society and Yizhen Society Send Personnel for Relief</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ten Thousand Society and the Sino-Foreign Relief Society previously received an urgent telegram from Gaochun County, Jiangsu, stating that Gaochun had suffered a severe drought last year, and the spring famine was even worse. As of today, residents in the Dongba Town area of the county have run out of grain. Nearly a thousand disaster victims mistakenly ate stone noodles and suffered fatal intestinal damage. The Ten Thousand Society, led by President Li Tianzhen, and the Sino-Foreign Relief Society, led by Cheng Yiqing, sent two gentlemen to investigate. They sent a telegram yesterday, stating that the relief funds they brought were insufficient, and the disaster in the county was more severe than anyone could have imagined.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Discuss China's Economic Situation and Future (Continued)</h3>
<p>Mr. Tachibana, Shanghai branch manager of Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, also asked how the U.S. silver policy affected China. Mr. Yoshida said that the U.S. silver policy violated the London Agreement of the 1933 World Economic Conference but also blamed China for not responding properly to the U.S. Mr. Mile said that U.S. domestic affairs could not be changed by international opinion. Although the U.S. has recently shown a slight pro-China attitude, it is unlikely to help. Mr. Funatsu said that among China's enlightened classes, it is now clear that they are being hit by U.S. policies, but China's gentlemanly attitude toward the U.S. is less enthusiastic than before. Mr. Mile said that if they continue to let it go without seeking a solution, the price of silver will become more expensive, making it more difficult for China to export, and the daily decline in prices will result in endless losses. Mr. Tachibana said that when he was in Hankou around the Lunar New Year, it was very lively, and the situation seemed more optimistic than in previous years. Mr. Yamamoto said that Hankou sold a lot of oil at the end of last year, so no cash flowed out. Mr. Hirano said that Hankou's economy could not stand alone, and foreign banks were to blame for Shanghai's financial crisis. They continued to ship out cash, and the result would be that foreign banks themselves would suffer the same fate. The situation in the Chinese interior was due to China's unique economic organization, and Hankou exported a lot of goods, so it was not affected by cash. Mr. Shimobe said that if exports increased and imports decreased, the high silver price would be a contradiction. Mr. Mile said that China's smuggling was very large, accounting for about 10% of exports. In 1933, exports were 1.3 billion, and smuggling was 134 million yuan. In 1934, smuggling was even higher among the 535 million yuan of exports. Mr. Yoshida said that the smuggling of silver in China was between 60 million and 80 million per year. Mr. Mile said that according to the customs statistics for the 24th year, it was 69 million yuan, but in reality, it was 189 million yuan, which made the domestic silver empty. Mr. Tachibana asked if British and American loans to China could be successful. Mr. Yoshida said that it was unlikely that Britain would lend money alone. Although there was a rumor that a certain U.S. bank was willing to lend 10 million yuan, the opposing banks would not pass it. Would these loans to China be alone or joint? In practice, it was extremely difficult, whether alone or jointly. Mr. Tachibana asked if Japan should participate in international loans to China. Mr. Yoshida said that he dared not predict this issue at the moment. Mr. Mile said that Japan's participation in international loans would be harmful rather than beneficial. Mr. Yoshida said that observing the attitudes of Britain and the U.S., they hoped that Japan's relations with China would deteriorate. Mr. Funatsu said that Sino-Japanese cooperation did not mean that Japan wanted to profit and monopolize China. Mr. Tachibana then raised the issue of boycotting Japanese goods for discussion. Mr. Mile said that since the meetings of Sino-Japanese dignitaries, the atmosphere had gradually improved, but it had not been thoroughly implemented, so he hoped that China would further crack down on it. Mr. Tachibana also raised the future of Japanese trade with China for discussion. Mr. Shimobe said that trade with China was gradually decreasing, and there were many reasons for the decrease. Recently, it was caused by financial obstruction, political impropriety, and high exchange rates. Although high exchange rates were beneficial for imports, it was not good for business, and exports were out of the question. At present, it was still difficult to be optimistic about exports and imports. Mr. Tachibana said that although they did not boycott Japanese goods, would Japan be able to restore the original state of trade with China before the incident in the name of encouraging domestic products or raising tariffs? Mr. Bu said that raising tariffs would definitely affect Japanese goods. If the tax rates on crude and semi-finished products were increased, it would hinder raw materials. If the sales of raw materials were sluggish, China's industry would also be greatly affected.</p>

<h3>Yan Wanglong Impersonation: Hongshan Temple Land Case Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 22nd of This Month</h3>
<p>Yuanzhao, a monk who previously served as abbot of Longhua Temple and Hongshan Temple located west of Dananmen, was sued by the current abbot of Longhua Temple, monk Xingkong, and Hongshan Temple monk Minfeng, etc., in the local court for encroachment on temple property, etc. After the court meticulously sought details and repeatedly summoned witnesses and conducted inquiries, it ruled that Yuanzhao was to be sentenced to four years imprisonment and fined three thousand yuan for the encroachment on Longhua Temple, and four years imprisonment and fined three thousand yuan for the encroachment on Hongshan Temple, with a combined execution period of six years and a combined fine of six thousand yuan. The private prosecution portion was transferred to the civil court for trial. Yuanzhao, dissatisfied with the verdict, was still within the appeal period, and the private prosecution's legal representative was also in progress. Therefore, Yuanzhao remained in custody at the detention center, and the sentence has not been carried out. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the public prosecution portion of Yuanzhao's encroachment on Longhua Temple and Hongshan Temple has concluded. In the public prosecution portion of encroachment on Hongshan Temple, Yan Wanglong, Yuanzhao's nephew-in-law, appeared in court and falsely claimed that the land of Hongshan Temple belonged to his family (the old site of the temple had 24 buildings built, including the main hall, which were rented out, collecting over nine hundred yuan in rent each month, enough to ensure a comfortable life). Judge Shao Qinzhi ordered that Yan Wanglong, the perjurer, be handed over to the prosecutor's office for detention. On one hand, Minfeng filed a complaint, and prosecutor Li Fen conducted a clear interrogation, initiating a public prosecution against Yan Wanglong for perjury and embezzlement, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Liu Enrong, the head of the criminal court, specifically opened the third courtroom for trial, ordering the detained Yan Wanglong to be brought to the case. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to Yan Wanglong's testimony, he is 35 years old, from Ninghai, Zhejiang, residing at No. 2 Fu'an Lane, Baiyang Lane, Dananmen (the old site of the temple), running a small store. Asked if he has any property, he replied that he has 24 buildings. Asked if he has other names, he replied that he also has the name Yan Hengli. Asked if he has any kinship with Yuanzhao, he replied that they are not relatives, but only from the same hometown. Asked what his wife's surname is, he replied that his wife's surname is Sijiao Ma (literally "four-legged horse," the "Ma" is the horse "Ma"). Asked how many buildings are in Fu'an Lane in total, he replied that there are 24 buildings, built in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), costing over 44,000 yuan. Asked where the money came from, he replied that it was borrowed. Asked how much land there is, he replied that there are over two mu. Asked whose name the land is under, he replied that it is under the name of Ling Guyu. Asked why Ling Guyu's property is in his possession, he replied that because the Ling family had no son, it was given to his family. Asked if this land is clearly Hongshan Temple's, he replied that it is not, it was rented to Hongshan Temple until the term expired in the 16th year of the Republic (1927). After negotiation, his father, Ling Yunyuan, exchanged the contract and continued the lease until it was taken back in the 19th year of the Republic (1930). Asked why his surname is Yan but his father is called Ling Yunyuan, he replied that the Ling surname is from his maternal grandmother's family. Because there was no son, his father inherited the line. Asked if there is any proof that he renewed the lease for three years after the 16th year of the Republic, he replied that there is none. Asked if he can rely on his word alone, Yan lowered his head and did not answer. Asked if he had evidence when he took it back, as he said during the prosecutor's preliminary hearing, and why he didn't bring it, he replied that he did not. Asked whose name is on the land deed, he replied that there are two, one for Ling Guyu and one for Ling Yunyuan. Asked where these two deeds are, he replied that one was taken to Fujian by Ling Guyu's wife, and the other was mortgaged to Xinhua Bank for five thousand yuan. Asked when it was mortgaged, he replied that it was mortgaged last year under his father's name, Ling Yunyuan. Asked when Ling Guyu's wife left, he replied that she left after he was arrested. Asked when his father died, he replied that he died in the twelfth month of the 19th year of the Republic (early 1931). Asked why he used his father's name, Ling Yunyuan, when he mortgaged it last year, Yan stammered. The judge said, "You still haven't told the truth. Does the bank need the name of a dead person? This court has already investigated and understands. You are fabricating excuses and talking nonsense." Yan was speechless. Asked if he knows Hong Zicai, he replied that he does not. The judge said that according to Yuanzhao's previous testimony, a landlord surnamed Hong took back the land in the fourth month of the 19th year of the Republic (mid 1930), and later Yuanzhao said that Hong Zicai handled it, showing contradictions and flaws. Asked if the house is insured, he replied that it is, handled by someone surnamed Qiu. Asked which company it is insured by, he replied that he doesn't know. Asked where the insurance policy is, he replied that the person surnamed Qiu did not bring it. Asked what he would do if it burned down, he replied that the person surnamed Qiu is Yuanzhao's accountant. Asked if Yuanzhao asked him to help, he replied that he did not. Asked if he should tell the truth, otherwise it would be very unfavorable to him, and the case is already clear, and it is futile to shirk responsibility and lie. He replied that the money to build the house was indeed borrowed. The judge ordered Yuanzhao to be brought to the case. He testified that he is 49 years old, from Ninghai, and formerly the abbot of Longhua Temple. He also once managed Hongshan Temple. Asked if he knows Yan Wanglong, he replied that he did not know him before. He only met him after his father died in the 19th year of the Republic (early 1931). Asked if Yan Wanglong is his nephew-in-law, he replied no. Asked if his common surname is Ma, he replied that his surname is Ma (flax) not Ma (horse). Asked how much land Hongshan Temple has, he replied that it has over two mu. Asked why the Yan surname built a house, he replied that the old monk Guangjian told him in the past that when the land lease expired in the 16th year (1927), he asked him to discuss continuing the lease with the landlord Ling Guyu for three years. Asked when the old monk told him, he replied that he told him in the 14th year (1925). Asked if there was rent, he replied that the rent was extremely low, only a few yuan of grain and silk each year. Asked if there was any evidence at the time, he replied that there was, and it has already been taken back. Asked who took it back, Yuanzhao pondered for a moment and only replied that the receipt was canceled when it was taken back. Asked if he said during the prosecutor's preliminary hearing that the term expired in the fourth month of the 18th year of the Republic (mid 1929), and asked who took it back, he replied that Hong Zicai came to represent the Yan surname to take it back. Why was it so simple and easily taken back, which shows falsehood. Also asked if he and Yan Wanglong often come and go, he replied that they do not. He came in the 20th year (1931). Asked what he came for, he replied that it was just for casual talk. Asked how many times he came, he replied that he came twice. Asked why his insurance policy was found in his place, he replied that because he had 500 yuan in shares in the Jinshan Cigarette Factory, and the Yan surname also had shares. He wanted to split the shares, so Chen Changgeng, the factory's accountant, came to his house to settle the accounts, bringing the leather bag, and the Yan surname's insurance policy was also in the bag. He had said so when the Bao Tan came to arrest him. Asked why his family's insurance policy was placed in his place, Yuanzhao stammered. At this point, the judge turned to Yan Wanglong and asked, "Why is your insurance policy in Yuanzhao's place?" Yan replied that the insurance policy is in the Chen surname accountant's place at the Jinshan Cigarette Factory. Asked how it was found in Yuanzhao's place, he replied that the Chen surname lived with Yuanzhao. When Yan Wanglong testified, his eyebrows were tightly locked, as if he had infinite deep sorrow, apprehension, and embarrassment. The judge, finding that the content of the case was quite clear and had been investigated thoroughly, asked prosecutor Li Fen to rise and present the charges. The judge asked Yan if he had any final statement, and he replied no. The judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 22nd of this month. Yan Wanglong and Yuanzhao were both returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Qian Jianwen's Ancestral Property Dispute: Second Instance Judgment Victorious</h3>
<p>Qian Liangzhou, et al., bear the litigation costs for the first and second trials. Qian Jianwen, a local villager in his sixties residing at the Qian family residence on Tairasituo Road in the French Concession, earns a living by farming. He previously served as a bailiff. He owns a piece of ancestral graveyard land located within the second district of the twenty-seventh bao (administrative division) nearby, with three graves on it. At the beginning of last winter, Qian sold this graveyard land to Zhu Zhensheng from Dongtingshan for nearly ten thousand yuan and moved the graves. Qian Liangzhou, Qian Jisheng, Qian Guisheng, and others from the same distant clan came out to stop the sale and relocation. Qian Jianwen argued that the property rights were inherited from his great-grandfather, with complete deeds and grain receipts, so he ignored them and proceeded with the sale and relocation. Qian Liangzhou, et al., then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering Qian Jianwen not to privately sell the jointly owned ancestral graveyard land and relocate the coffins, etc. After the court summoned and investigated, it ruled that Qian Jianwen was not allowed to privately move the jointly owned ancestral graveyard. Qian Jianwen, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, submitting reasons and evidence. Meanwhile, on December 5th, he, together with his sons Qian Jiji and Qian Shunfa, invited more than ten workers and proceeded to excavate the graves and move the corpses and bones to Caohjing in the western countryside. Qian Liangzhou, et al., reported to the police to stop it, but it was ineffective. They then filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court against Qian Jianwen, his sons Qian Jiji and Qian Shunfa, the buyer Zhu Zhensheng, and the intermediary Huang Miaojin, for violating Articles 263, 265, 337, and 356 of the Criminal Law, such as destroying and excavating graves, stealing valuables from the graves, and encroaching on public property, requesting legal investigation. Judge Qiu Huan Ying opened the court twice to summon and interrogate. The defendants hired lawyers to defend themselves. The details have been reported previously. Subsequently, because the criminal case was related to the civil case, the criminal case could not proceed until the civil case was resolved. The court ordered that the criminal case be temporarily suspended and resumed after the civil case was determined. Now, Qian Jianwen's civil appeal has been heard several times by the Third Branch of the High Court. The evidence submitted by both the original and the appealed parties could not accurately specify which generation of ancestors the two parties inherited from. The written evidence submitted by the appealed party Qian Liangzhou, et al., such as the merits document written by the Taoist priest, was also empty and could not actively prove which generation of ancestors were buried in the tomb. The case has now concluded its debate. The day before yesterday was the sentencing date. Court President Guo Dezhang, accompanied by judges Li Shouyi and Xiong Huiping, opened the court to pronounce the judgment. The parties Qian Jianwen and Qian Liangzhou were both present in court to await the judgment. The judge read the main text of the judgment, stating that the original judgment was changed, and the appeal of the appealed party was rejected. The litigation costs for the first and second trials were to be borne by the appealed party. The judge also briefly explained the intent of the judgment to both parties. A dispute over ancestral property has come to a temporary end.</p>
<h3>Robber Shen Guangyi and Others Commit Multiple Robberies</h3>
<p>French Police Request Transfer for Prosecution; Court Orders Further Investigation Before Review</p>
<p>Li Pengfei and Xie Wanfang, Chinese detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station, previously arrested Shen Guangyi, Gao Tianyou, Wu Hongyou, a woman with a handgun named Li Xiaomei, all from Anhui, for plotting to rob the property of the doorman Yin Ren of the China Tobacco Company at No. 72 Weituoma Road, and the suspect Liu Dajun, a foreman from Anhui at the Xihe Yarn Factory on Robusheng Road. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, awaiting further proceedings. It was found that they had committed two robberies: (1) At 8:00 PM on June 1, 1932, they used weapons to gather a gang and rob a woman named Zhang Zhang on Binlang Road, stealing clothing and jewelry worth 150.5 yuan; (2) At 4:00 AM on August 15, 1934, they robbed the Baofa Silver Shop at No. 1184 Huade Road, stealing gold and silver ornaments worth 501 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the review in Criminal Court Three. Labour Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan stated that in the Binlang Road case, the defendant Shen Guangyi confessed that he went to rob with Gao Tianyou and several others at large. Gao admitted to receiving three yuan after the fact, and he was the lookout. In the Huade Road Baofa Silver Shop case, the method of robbery was different. Before the incident, there were rooms for rent above the silver shop. A man surnamed Zhang and a woman came and initially paid one yuan as a deposit, staying temporarily. The next day, the man said that his business location was in Nanshi, and it was inconvenient to travel back and forth, so the woman stayed alone. On the 14th, another woman came to accompany her. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 AM the next morning, a robbery occurred. The shop assistants were tied up with ropes, and their mouths were stuffed with cloth to prevent them from making noise. The safe was opened, and valuables were stolen. The two women upstairs escaped in a car. The defendant Shen Guangyi admitted that he, Zhang Jiangao (the man who rented the room), Fei Guangjin, and Wu Hongyou committed the crime. Afterwards, Shen exchanged silverware worth 17.4 yuan at the Xiangtai Silver Shop at No. 1219 Robusheng Road. An investigation has confirmed this. In this case, Zhang Jiangao and the two women had planned it in advance. While the shop assistants were asleep, they opened the back door and let the thieves in to rob. After the crime, they escaped together. The defendants also committed robberies at the Yansizhi Tobacco Shop at No. 331 Yangshupu Road, the residents at No. 28 Renshou Lane, and a resident surnamed Mou on Jisfi Road in the Chinese area, stealing property worth only six yuan. However, the shop assistant and Renshou Lane incident could not be investigated. The victims had moved away early, so the police did not prosecute. However, in two robbery cases in the French Concession, one at No. 2 Gaofu Lane on Shengmuyuan Road and the other at a residence on Julada Road in January of this year, the firearms were carried by Zhao Dingyun, who acted as a firefighter at No. 28 Xiafei Road. He wore a uniform and long leather boots, and he hid the handgun in his boot. The patrol did not inspect him. Zhao has also been arrested. Now the French police have sent detectives to the court to request the transfer of the defendants. It is found that the defendant Liu Dajun had a connection with Li Xiaomei in supplying firearms. Li had also mentioned it in the previous court hearing. When questioned, Shen Guangyi admitted to the robberies on Binlang Road, Huade Road, and the two in the French Concession, and that he went to rob them. Gao Tianyou completely overturned his admission at the police station regarding the Binlang Road case. Wu Hongsheng firmly denied the Huade Road robbery, saying that he was not in Shanghai at the time. He left on July 16 of last year to visit his relative Zhang Zicheng at No. 174 in the Tianjin French Concession, and he stayed until he returned to Shanghai on September 18. Zhang wrote a letter to him in June, which he still has with a friend and can be found. Shen Guangyi accused him. Regarding the two robberies in the French Concession, he went with Shen. However, Li Shixi, a shop assistant from Baofa Silver Shop, pointed out that he was indeed present at the robbery, putting the silver ornaments into a cloth bag and escaping. He has a black mole on his chin, which he clearly remembers. Li Xiaomei and Liu Dajun's statements were as before. Judge Wu stated that the case still needs investigation. He informed the representative from the French Police that the defendants would be returned to custody separately, and the review would be rescheduled after the matter is further investigated.</p>
<h3>Professor of Tokyo Imperial University Visits China to See Doctor Fei Zibin</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Itsuji Yo Goro, a professor of medicine and medical doctor at Tokyo Imperial University, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He studied in Germany for many years and is also the director of Nanyodo Hospital, a famous scholar in Japan. Based on his decades of experience in treating patients, he feels that Western medicine urgently needs to be supplemented by Chinese medicine. Because China is the birthplace of Chinese medicine, he plans to conduct a detailed investigation of Chinese medicine to promote medical progress. Also, because the five types of lung disease pills produced by the Fei family of Menghe have been proven to eliminate tuberculosis, they are famous overseas. He especially hired someone to introduce him and brought an interpreter to visit the famous Shanghai doctor Fei Zibin, where they had a long conversation. He also took various pills produced by the Fei family to study. It is reported that he will travel to Suzhou, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin before returning to Japan via the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Mao Guisen's Incense Workshop: Seventeen Rooms Completely Destroyed by Fire</h3>
<p>Losses Estimated at Over Ten Thousand</p>
<p>The Wanghexing Incense Workshop at No. 34 Qingyang Road, Tangqiao Town, Pudong, owned by Mao Guisen from Nanxiang, had fifteen south-facing tile-roofed rooms and four west-facing thatched rooms built to the east, all used for workshop purposes. In addition to incense sticks, its products included Tiger Brand mosquito coils, and business was good. At the west end of the tile-roofed rooms, there were two market rooms built along Pudong Avenue, where sundries such as cigarettes, paper, oil, and wine were sold. At around 9 PM the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out in the thatched room to the east. Because the roof beams, walls, and pillars were all made of bamboo, they caught fire immediately and could not be extinguished. When the flames reached their peak, the patrol police blew their whistles to report the fire. The Tangqiao Police Station then telegraphed various parties for assistance. Zhao, the director of the Pudong Fire Brigade, led his team to drive to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, Laobaidu, Yangjing, and other fire brigades also went to assist in the firefighting. At this time, the fire had spread to the south-facing tile-roofed rooms. Because they contained large amounts of candle oil and coal extract, the fire intensified. Although several water dragons were used to extinguish the fire, it had no effect. After the entire row of rooms was burned down, the two market rooms followed. The fire gradually died down around 1 AM the next morning. In this fire, all the buildings of the incense workshop, including seventeen tile-roofed rooms and four thatched rooms, were completely destroyed. Due to the rapid spread of the fire, few of the production tools were salvaged. The total loss of goods and buildings is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan. Regarding the cause of the fire, the shop claimed that the four thatched rooms had been locked and no one had entered or left, so it was unclear where the fire started. It is still difficult to determine. After the fire was extinguished, because the shop owner Mao Guisen was still in Puxi and had not returned, the Tangqiao Police Station took one of the partners to the station for questioning to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Xu Yunfei Arrested for Illegal Possession of Firearms</h3>
<p>French police detectives, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, noticed a group of people in front of the Dà Shìjiè on Mintiniyin Road. They were acting suspiciously and hastily, and they were taken to the police station for questioning. They identified themselves as Xu Yunfei, 28 years old, from Ningbo, nicknamed Xiao Ningbo, residing at No. 28 Jinyu Lane, Nanchujia Bridge. A handgun was found in his house. The detectives then took him to his house and searched it. A six-inch Browning handgun and seven bullets were found under the bed in the bedroom. They were taken back to the police station and detained. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, briefly stating that the defendant was illegally possessing firearms. The police had not yet investigated whether he had committed any crimes. He requested a two-week extension to investigate before prosecuting him. He also presented the handgun and bullets to the court. Xu Yunfei testified that the handgun was sent to his house by a friend, and he had not committed any crimes. Judge Li Changnian reviewed the testimony and ordered a postponement to the 25th for further interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Chongde Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association Holds Spring Reunion Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chongde Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association held its spring reunion at the Quánjiāfú Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road yesterday at 1:00 PM to promote fellowship and discuss matters such as disaster relief for the county in the spring and recruiting members. More than thirty people attended, including Chen Xijiang, Cai Pinde, Ma Zanming, Sheng Peidong, Qian Tianren, Hua Zhenxin, Cai Jingxiong, etc. First, Hua Zhenxin reported on the situation of last year's fundraising for drought relief in the county.

<h3>Ford Company Continues Exhibition Today</h3>
<p>The Ford Motor Company has just shipped a large number of 1935 streamlined V-8 automobiles from the United States. They were displayed at the Meitong Motor Company at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Maierxi Ai Road for the past two days, inviting local people to visit and showing sound films "Ford and a Century of Progress" and "Steel Rhapsody."

<h3>Yang Bingxun Adds Chinese Stenography Night School</h3>
<p>The Bingxun Chinese Stenography School in Shànchāng Lane on Kad Road has been operating for many years and has achieved excellent results, cultivating specialized Chinese stenography talents. Many people are serving in various places. The current spring enrollment has officially started. However, employees of businesses and companies in this city are still unable to enjoy this new skill due to work schedules. Therefore, the school has repeatedly received letters requesting the establishment of a night school so that those who have work can also have the opportunity to learn. The principal Yang Bingxun, in view of this, has specifically opened a Bingxun Chinese Stenography Night School in the building behind the Hengdali at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, inside the Shangzheng School. It has now advertised for enrollment. Registration starts today, and classes start on the 25th. The tuition fee is especially reduced, and there are free and preferential measures. It is reported that the number of people requesting information and registering these days is very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Founding of the National Goods Manufacturers Joint Association Along the Two Railways, Passing Bylaws, and Electing Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</h3>
<p>The National Goods Manufacturers Joint Association Along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways was organized by enthusiastic participants in the three Ping-Shi Railway Exhibitions. After a long period of preparation, it was formally announced yesterday (the 17th). On the same day, the association held a meeting on the third floor of the Guanshengyuan Confectionery on Nanjing Road to elect the first Executive and Supervisory Committee members. More than 100 representatives from Party and government agencies, groups, and manufacturers attended. The representatives of Huasheng Electric Factory, Guanshengyuan Food Factory, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhongxin Factory, and Ertiantang Pharmaceutical Factory were elected as the presidium. After the meeting was formally opened, the presidium explained the reasons for the meeting, stating that the association originated from the temporary office of manufacturers along the two railways participating in the three Ping-Shi Railway Exhibitions. The organization has been in preparation for a long time and is now largely ready. In recent years, the Ministry of Railways has actively promoted national goods, convening railway exhibitions every year and establishing national goods sales offices at major stations along the lines, so that national goods can be sold smoothly along the lines, benefiting both producers and consumers. In order to promote sales to the entire railway lines and make national goods flow into the countryside, the organization of this association was formed. It is hoped that everyone can unite and work together. Then, Xiang Hongchang, Zheng Jipu, and Liang Shizhi reported on the preparatory process. Then, the bylaws and other proposals were discussed and amended. Finally, fifteen Executive Committee members and seven Supervisory Committee members were elected by secret ballot. After the election, a tea party was held and photos were taken before adjourning.</p>
<p>National Goods Manufacturers Joint Association Along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways - Declaration</p>
<p>Since the opening of trade, imperialists, relying on the excellence of their industrial products, have been dumping them into our country as much as possible, doing everything they can in economic aggression. As a result, a huge amount of money has flowed out of our country, creating an unprecedented economic crisis, and leading to a semi-colonial status. It is now known that the harm of economic aggression is greater than the threat of political and military aggression. The way to save the situation lies in promoting national goods and resisting foreign goods, so that huge amounts of silver will not flow out continuously, so as to build national industry and implement economic nationalism, so as to create self-reliance and self-sufficiency for the people, so that the abundant raw materials produced in the countryside have a stable outlet, and are no longer subject to the monopoly and manipulation of foreign export firms, so that the rural economy can have hope of revival. However, the call for promoting national goods has been around for a long time, but it has not been effective because of the lack of organization. National goods factories are independent of each other, and talents and economy cannot cooperate. Manufacturing and pricing are mutually suppressed, and promotion and publicity are rarely linked, resulting in high production costs and difficulty in improving products, or crude manufacturing and shoddy workmanship, only seeking to reduce prices and compete for sales, or inadequate promotion and weak publicity, giving foreign businessmen an opportunity to dump their goods, like a dam breaking, and the national economy is almost in danger of bankruptcy. Our national goods manufacturers are in this difficult situation. If they want to turn the tide and open up a way out, they should concentrate their efforts and fight together, acting as the vanguard of economic warfare externally, and shouldering the mission of recovering rights and interests internally. Therefore, the colleagues do not avoid hardships and resolutely shoulder this important task. Therefore, there is the organization of the National Goods Manufacturers Joint Association Along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways. It is believed that the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the center of national wealth. Since the opening of trade, emerging industries have also been concentrated here. Geographically, they are adjacent to each other, and traffic is connected. Over the years, they have suffered foreign aggression together and deeply feel that it is not a good strategy to fight alone, so there is a need for joint assistance. Moreover, the railway authorities hold national railway line product exhibitions every year to promote national goods and increase freight, so that the people of the country have the opportunity to recognize and purchase national goods. This shows the government's intention to promote national goods. Under the encouragement of the whole country, the colleagues should devote their loyalty to serving national goods and persevere until success. However, there are many national goods groups in recent years, and some who do not understand the truth may recognize that the organization of this association is superfluous. Therefore, the colleagues cannot help but make a statement. In today's national goods groups, there is no shortage of sincere promoters of national goods, but their strength is limited and they cannot take care of everything at the same time. In addition, there are also those who borrow the name and regard it as a source of profit. The reason why it is disappointing is that national goods manufacturers rely on others for everything and cannot automatically organize and manage, so they cannot seek progress for the national goods movement. In order to show sincerity to others, the colleagues dare to frankly state that they do not want to use group activities as a stepping stone for personal political advancement, and they dare not control the association as a private stronghold. The sole purpose is to serve the national goods movement as the highest goal, and absolutely reject improper speculation and profit-seeking ideas. It is hoped that the government authorities, the people of the country, and national goods factories will give guidance, so that the national goods movement will make progress day by day, in order to build a nation, revive industry, relieve the countryside, save the country, and revive the nation. I am willing to encourage each other with the people of the country. This is the declaration, please consider it publicly.</p>

<h3>Detailed Inquiry into the Transformation Process in a Small Room: An Interview with Yao Jinping, Who Transformed into a Man</h3>
<p>Previously Betrothed to the Second Son of Commander Xing Zhanqing. Mr. Li Du is Willing to Provide 30 Gold Pieces a Month to Help Him Return to His Hometown to Study.</p>
<p>—Mr. Yao Himself Talks About the Process of Physiological Transformation in Detail—</p>
<p>—Since Yesterday, Visitors from All Walks of Life Have Been Streaming In—</p>
<p>Since the newspapers published that Yao Zhen (also known as Yao Gengsheng or Yao Jinping), who transformed from a woman into a man, came to Shanghai, it has immediately caused a sensation in all walks of life, who consider it an unprecedented wonder. The reporter of Huadong News Agency also believes that this matter is quite valuable for research. Therefore, yesterday, he visited Mr. Yao, who transformed from a woman into a man, and had a detailed conversation with him, in order to provide the process of transformation for the research of domestic physiologists and the medical community.</p>
<p>In a Small Room, He Was Having Breakfast</p>
<p>Mr. Yao and his grandfather, Qingpu, are staying on the third floor of No. 18 Caishou Lane, Julai Road. There are three buildings there, all of which are occupied by the families of the Northeast Army under Li Du. No. 17 and No. 35 are occupied by some men of the army. Since Mr. Yao has transformed into a man, he also lives with his grandfather on the third floor of that building. When the reporters entered to visit, Mr. Yao and others were having breakfast. So they sat for a while and waited for him to finish his meal before inquiring about the process of his physiological transformation.</p>
<p>A Glance Reveals That He Has Changed His Hairpin for a Cap</p>
<p>When the reporters entered, they saw Mr. Yao Zhen, who had transformed from a woman into a man, wearing a blue robe and short hair　　, parted on the left and right, carrying a basin and eating. Beside him was an old man over sixty years old with good spirits and health. At this time, it was not necessary to be introduced by others to know that the one wearing the blue cloth robe was Mr. Yao, because his demeanor still retained the original appearance of a woman. After inquiring, it was indeed true. When talking with him, it was even more evident that there were slight gaps in his ears, which were caused by piercing his ears in his childhood. His feet were slightly small, which was because they had been bound. As for his fair skin and slender fingertips, they all showed the physical characteristics of a woman. The only difference was that before he had two braids hanging down his shoulders, but now they have been cut off.</p>
<p>Sitting Around a Small Table, Talking Freely About the Process</p>
<p>The reporters first inquired about his situation when he was a woman. Mr. Yao was initially unable to answer, and his grandfather explained for him, but there were discrepancies from time to time. So Mr. Yao himself told the truth. According to him, when he was a woman in the past, everything was the same as a woman. When he was fourteen years old, his menstruation had already started, and it came every month thereafter without interruption. On the twenty-first day of the seventh lunar month of last year, he suddenly felt unwell, and his mind was quite confused. He did not eat and slept on the bed. When it was late, he suddenly heard thunder and was startled awake. At this time, he discovered that the female sex organs had already changed. He had transformed into a great man.</p>
<p>Feeling Something in His Heart, He Changed Clothes After a Dream</p>
<p>At that time, he was very surprised and secretly told his grandmother. His grandmother did not believe it and examined him, which was indeed true. But she was still quite suspicious. Until the next night, he suddenly dreamed of an old woman who told him to quickly change into men's clothes and warned him not to see strangers within a hundred days. So he began to change his hairpin for a cap and stayed at home all day. No one else knew about this strange change except his family. When the hundred days were up, he revealed the matter to the outside world. So it caused a sensation in the neighborhood and was considered a strange story.</p>
<p>After a Month, Changes All Over His Body</p>
<p>For a month after the transformation, he was bored at home. Suddenly, he felt unusually sore all over his body. He was shocked at that time, but he gradually recovered. A month later, he returned to normal. During this period, his breasts, which were quite full, suddenly gradually flattened and resembled the breasts of a man. A lump also grew on his neck, which may be other physiological changes after the transformation of the sex organs.</p>
<p>Asking for a Book and Writing a Message, He Quite Likes Women</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked him, "Then, after the transformation, can you have the same sexual feelings for women as other men?" When Mr. Yao heard this, he could not answer immediately. So he asked the reporter for paper and wrote, "I am now no different from a man. After a hundred days, I think I will have a little love for women." The word "think" is a slight error. But from these few words, it can be seen that Mr. Yao, who is now a man, also knows the loveliness of women. It can be proved that his transformation is completely no different from a man.</p>
<p>Not Fully Developed, He Needs More Recuperation</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Yao's grandfather interjected, "Although he has now transformed into a man, his reproductive organs have not yet fully developed. They are slightly smaller than those of ordinary people and slightly pointed." The reporter then told him that he should ask a doctor to examine him so that he could know whether his physiological organization after the transformation is complete. Mr. Yao's grandfather said that he still needs to recuperate for a while before asking a doctor to examine him. At the same time, the reporter also heard others say that General Li Du has decided to ask a doctor to examine him to study whether Mr. Yao's physiological transformation has been successful.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Assistance to Study in His Hometown</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yao's grandfather, the purpose of coming to Shanghai this time was to follow the families of Mr. Li's army to Xin (new place) in the near future to find the whereabouts of his father, Youtang. But General Li prevented him from going because he was young and was willing to provide him with two or thirty gold pieces a month to continue his studies in Tianjin. Therefore, they will have to return to their hometown of Qingxian, Tianjin, in the near future.</p>
<p>Previously Betrothed to Someone, It is In Effect Cancelled</p>
<p>He also said that when Mr. Yao's father was in Jilin, he had betrothed her to the second son of Xing Zhanqing, the commander of the First Division. But at that time, it was only mentioned verbally, and there was no marriage contract. Therefore, this matter should not be a problem. When Mr. Yao was studying at a primary school in his hometown, he was in the same class as his aunt. His aunt's age was also the same. Mr. Yao also has a younger brother, who is seven years old. Before, they were sisters, but now they have become brothers. When Mr. Yao's grandfather talked about this matter, he smiled often, which showed that he was very happy. But when he talked about the unknown whereabouts of his son, Youtang, he became gloomy and unhappy. Yesterday, curious visitors from all sides came one after another from morning to night, which shows a glimpse of the curiosity of all parties.</p>
<p>Medical Observation, Quite a Lot of Doubts</p>
<p>The reporter asked Dr. Yan Fuqing, the dean of the National Shanghai Medical College, again yesterday morning. According to him, this kind of physiological action may be a variant of what is commonly called "female incubates male". In the past, observers had different subjective views, and those who believed that they were women each held their own opinions. Now that a change has occurred, everyone is surprised. However, the real truth still needs to be studied by scientific methods. According to Dr. Xu Naili, the supervisor of the Physicians Association, this kind of thing is rare, but it cannot be judged as a fact based on brain speculation alone. However, according to the conversation with his grandfather, Yao Qingpu, the most obvious evidence is that the mammary peaks were very high before the change, but now they are flat and without traces. There are many different opinions, and no one knows the truth. It is indeed worth studying.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals Holds a Competition for Drawings Promoting the Protection of Life</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals has taken the meaning of the unity of all things and spread the concept of benevolence and love. It held an essay contest for the protection of life last year. Students from primary and secondary schools in Shanghai actively participated in the contest, and were able to express their spirit of benevolence and love in their works. It is now heard that the Western Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in this port has expressed its appreciation for the past essay contest methods of the association and plans to hold a drawing competition for the protection of life during this year's Animal Week (April 8 to April 13). All primary and secondary school students in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, can participate to arouse the benevolent thinking of young students to love animals. The part for Chinese children is entrusted to the association to handle. The general idea of the methods and drawing styles has been distributed to primary and secondary schools in this port a few days ago. Many schools have sent back letters to join the competition.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Layoffs at Yixin Toothbrush Factory</h3>
<p>Due to layoffs at the Yixin Toothbrush Factory on Huining Road in the South City, a dispute has arisen. Recently, the Shanghai Toothbrush Industry Trade Union, in order to take care of both parties, requested to maintain the status quo and sent a letter to the factory manager, saying: "Dear Sir, since your factory proposed to lay off a large number of workers, the Social Bureau has convened mediation many times. However, due to the insistence of both parties, it has not been properly resolved. However, it is heard that since the beginning of spring, your factory's business has been booming, raw materials have been piled up, and new workers have been recruited to help with the work. Judging from the facts, the layoff is not necessary. Even if it is as you wish and layoffs are allowed, suddenly exporting a large amount of severance pay is not a blessing for your factory's future. Moreover, success or failure, profit or loss, is still unpredictable. Our association is responsible for leading the workers and cannot stand idly by. It is hoped that your factory will consider the social depression, the displacement of the unemployed, and the lingering livelihood of the workers, and resolutely change the plan. For the sake of both parties, please maintain the status quo. This will not only eliminate the gap between labor and management, but also indirectly benefit social security. Sincerely conveyed, respectfully ask for your approval, and it will be extremely appreciated. Sincerely yours, Mr. Dai Zhicheng, Manager of Yixin Company, Shanghai Toothbrush Industry Trade Union, March 17."</p>

<p>A Good Friend of Photographers - The "Tetschin Type Exposure Meter" Which Has Recently Become Popular All Over the World</p>
<p>This is a new invention by Mr. Gao Weixiang, a photography expert who studied in Germany, based on his many years of in-depth research on exposure problems. It provides very accurate and detailed guidance on the exposure time required for indoor, outdoor, electric light, and flash photography. It is far superior to the "Exposure Timing Instrument" created by the same author nine years ago and the "Standard Exposure Instrument" created three years ago. Its comprehensive content, exquisite design, simple usage, and accurate calculation are far beyond the reach of all other exposure meters. With this one meter, no matter where or when, taking photos and videos only requires a light touch to immediately obtain the correct exposure time, and there is absolutely no need to calculate or think. And it can be used for any kind of lens box and film material. No matter how the weather or place changes, this meter can automatically indicate. Therefore, since its release, it has been printed in various languages and sold at home and abroad, and is invincible. Major photography societies and experts have extremely satisfactory comments. Recently, it has also obtained foreign patent rights, which shows the value of its nobility. Now, in addition to the exquisitely made one, priced at two yuan and five corners, which is sold in major camera shops in this port, for the sake of popularization, a plain-made one priced at one yuan and five corners has recently been released, which is exclusively sold by Gaoda and Ye Company, 3rd Floor, 133 Tuming Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>Buddhist Scriptures Explained and Sold at Reduced Prices</p>

He once held an official position, but later saw through the world, converted to Buddhism, and immersed himself in Buddhist studies diligently. He took the religious name Liaoyin Jushi. Then he thought that the meaning of Buddhist scriptures was difficult and not easy to understand. Therefore, he vowed to write the two books "Diamond Sutra Explained" and "Treasure Altar Sutra Explained". The explanation of Buddhist nature is detailed and the language is very clear. Everywhere, it leads people to see their own nature. With a profound and clear writing style, the meaning of the scriptures is explained completely. It is a necessary book for those who study Buddhism. Since its publication, it has been admired by lay Buddhists such as Qu Yingguang, Wang Yiting, Mei Guangyi, and Yu Muxia. Now, for the sake of popularization, the Diamond Sutra Explained is sold at a special reduced price of seven corners per book, and the Fashi Altar Sutra Explained is sold at a special reduced price of one yuan and four corners per book.

<h3>Medicine and Pharmaceutical World</h3>
<p>Holy Cough Medicine "Cure All Coughs" is Selling Well</p>
<p>"Cure All Coughs" tablets were invented by the famous German medical doctor, Dr. Hengpe, using drugs such as sea onion, earth root, weird cocoa, and xinyige, and refined through chemical experiments. It is the most proper holy medicine for expectorant and cough suppressant. The medicinal properties are mild and have no drawbacks. Since the application of this product to treat cough patients, I don't know how many there have been, and all of them have been cured. Its miraculous effect is like this. Moreover, recently, the weather has been bad, and the number of coughers is increasing day by day. It is also heard that the "Cure All Coughs" tablets in major pharmacies in this port have been bought out. From this, we can see a glimpse of its effectiveness. The selling price of the medicine is one yuan and five corners per bottle.</p>

<p>Judging from the stock indices of the United States, Britain, and Japan (1929 equals 100), there was a significant drop across the board before 1932 (except for Japan's index in 1932). However, since 1933, the indices of various countries have shown a tendency to rebound, and Japan has even exceeded its 1929 level. This also indicates that the industrial sector is gradually recovering. However, the United States experienced frequent labor strikes this year, which had a significant impact on the industrial sector, so its rebound was weaker.</p>

<p>(2) Commodity Prices: Among non-League of Nations countries, the commodity price indices this year, compared to 1933, mostly showed a slight increase, except for Japan, which saw a slight decline. For example, the wholesale price index of the United States (1913 equals 100) was 94.5 in 1933, but this year it rose to 107.2, exceeding the record of 1931. As for the cost of living index in the United States this year (1914 equals 100), it also increased by an average of 4.7 points compared to the previous year (1933). Besides the United States, the wholesale price index in the United Kingdom this year increased by 3.1 points compared to the previous year, while its retail price index increased by 1 point. Other countries such as Canada, Denmark, and Sweden also experienced slight increases in their wholesale and retail price indices. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Chen Yunsu</p>
<p>Ease and comfort are the coffin for ending life; labor is the sustenance for prolonging life. No matter what, always do it with your back straight. If you can't do it, furrow your brow and do it, grit your teeth and do it.</p>
<p>We should have the ambition of "predecessors planting trees, successors enjoying the shade," and not the thought of "I won't see it, why should I care about those who come after me."</p>
<p>We should not be like melon sellers, boasting about ourselves and praising ourselves to the skies; nor should we be like cowards, underestimating ourselves and thinking of ourselves as half a catty or eight taels.</p>
<p>An active youth should not yearn for singing halls and dance pavilions, or be infatuated with rosy dreams.</p>
<p>When a man falls in love with a woman, or a woman falls in love with a man, they invariably think the object of their affection is extremely satisfying, as fragrant and delicious as drinking champagne. But once their wish is fulfilled, they immediately feel like they are drinking flat beer, bland and tasteless, and it is better to seek new acquaintances and change their taste.</p>
<h3>Tang Tie</h3>
<p>— Wan Gong</p>
<p>"Without a 'Tang Tie' painting, you can't be considered a prominent family." This is a popular saying in Wuhu. "Tang Tie" is not a painting drawn on paper with brush and ink; it is made by kneading strips of wrought iron. Landscapes, figures, flowers, are all lifelike! When contrasted with white paper and paired with a wooden frame, it looks like a Xieyi painting by Da Dizi or Ying Piazi.</p>
<p>Iron, without being forged in fire, is always hard. If it is forged red, how can it be kneaded? The story of "Tang Tie" kneading paintings is as follows:</p>
<p>It is said that this blacksmith surnamed Tang—not a blacksmith, you could almost call him an artist—was originally an apprentice in a blacksmith shop. He was expelled by his master for some reason, and he lost his job, making his livelihood even more difficult! On a New Year's Eve, he really didn't want to live anymore, and had no choice but to go to Taotang to drown himself. As he was about to lift his clothes and jump, his right hand was suddenly grabbed by an old man who appeared from the side. This old man, very kind and sincere, persuaded him and comforted him. He suddenly felt a burning sensation in his hand, but the old man held on very tightly. He struggled with all his strength, and his hand was freed, but a human skin glove was peeled off out of thin air, and his blood and flesh were exposed. The old man patted him on the shoulder and said, "Alright! You will have food to eat from now on! Go back and blacksmith!" He was about to negotiate with the old man, but the old man suddenly disappeared. He held his bloody hand, dejectedly ran home, and indeed went to another master to learn blacksmithing.</p>
<p>One day, while blacksmithing, a piece of red-hot iron on the tongs suddenly fell onto his hand. He didn't even feel burned! He picked up this piece of red-hot iron casually, and with too much force, he actually flattened it. He then understood that his hand could enter fire without being burned. From then on, he began to use his hand to knead these iron paintings. After his death, no one else could do it. So until now, they are still cherished.</p>
<h3>Long Gown</h3>
<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>In the past, clothing represented a person's occupation, just as facial makeup represented the identity of a character in a play. When we see a painted face, we know it's a rough man, and when we see a white face, we know it's a treacherous hero. Clothing is also like facial makeup, symbolizing that person's occupation.</p>
<p>Scholars occupied the position of the upper class in the past, and becoming an official through studying was also considered an upper-class profession. The so-called upper class, not only had a better life and enjoyment than the lower class, but even their clothes had to be longer than those of the lower class, in order to show the airs of the upper class. Therefore, the literati who were called or called themselves the upper class all wore long gowns, and long gowns became popular.</p>
<p>In recent years, because of the eastward spread of European customs, everyone has tended towards fashion, so the long gown has been overthrown. Replacing its position is the Western suit. Professors and students are all dressed in Western attire, looking spirited, as if only in this way can they show that they are upper class.</p>
<p>But Western suits are only popular in cities, while the scholars in the countryside still wear a blue gown, swaying with every step, lecturing on their "Heaven and Earth Xuan Huang" articles. Therefore, in the countryside, the long gown still maintains its upper-class style.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child in my hometown, there was an old gentleman in his fifties, who was said to have passed the Xiucai examination during the late Qing Dynasty. He wore a blue ramie long gown in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. There were two holes in the cuffs of that long gown, the blue color had faded to gray, and it was covered with oil stains, but he was still reluctant to take it off, and wore it until he was put in his coffin.</p>
<p>Such a person can truly be called an "old conservative"!</p>
<h3>Balance of Power Assistance</h3>

<h3>A Pair: In Pairs</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiong Yu</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a young man from a prominent family, whose family is well-off and whose appearance is fair, but his temperament is reserved, like a maiden from the old days. When he meets a member of the opposite sex, he blushes and does not dare to look at them. He is of marriageable age but has not yet found a match, and his parents are not anxious to find a spouse for him. One day, a neighbor had a wedding, and the young man from a prominent family also participated in the congratulations. Because the bride was beautiful, the guests who congratulated the couple made a lot of noise in the bridal chamber, and it did not disperse until midnight. But the young man from a prominent family, after returning from drinking at the neighbor's house, suddenly changed his normal state. He babbled all day long, and when others listened carefully, he said... a pair... in pairs! Some people laughed secretly, as if he did not know. Afterwards, his parents could not stop him, and medicine could not cure him. This went on for months and years, and he has not yet recovered, which often causes jokes, causing a stir throughout the street. Here are a few anecdotes for your amusement:</p>
<p>1. When he opens his mouth, he always says... check... in pairs! Acquaintances are accustomed to it and do not pay attention; and his actions are also like this. Whenever he goes to someone's house, the interior of the house has thresholds. If the number of thresholds passed is not in pairs, even if he has entered the hall, he will not sit or speak and will return; when eating, if the number of cups and chopsticks is not in pairs, he will also shake his head and not sit, and he keeps saying... a pair... in pairs!</p>
<p>2. When he walks, he also silently counts the bridge beams and stone steps. If the number of stone steps is not in pairs, he would rather turn back and walk again (so that it is an even number), and he says... must be a pair... must be in pairs!</p>
<h3>About Sleep</h3>
<p>— (Linghu Zhao)</p>
<p>One-third of all the time that human beings have is spent in sleep. The "only" benefit of sleep is to rest the brain.</p>
<p>Usually, after working all day, we naturally feel physical fatigue; and sleep can indeed restore the original spirit.</p>
<p>In addition to resting the brain and restoring the spirit, sleep can also cure hunger. If a person is so poor that he has pawned everything and does not even have three copper coins to buy sesame cakes or fried dough sticks, then he only needs to sleep in bed to avoid the pain of an empty stomach. Therefore, sleep is also a good remedy for hunger.</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>From the day I went with the Empress Dowager, whenever I had free time, I would run to those four or five large rooms to visit. Sure enough, I saw them larger each time than the last. First, they grew to an inch, then to an inch and a half the next day, and later they grew to two inches long. In this way, they could no longer be allowed to be squeezed into a small plate of one or two hundred; so the girls who raised silkworms carefully divided each plate of silkworms into two plates; when they grew larger again, they were divided into larger bamboo plates.</p>
<p>"The mulberry leaves eaten by the young silkworms are all cut very finely, and only the tenderest ones are chosen. In about four or five days, they will be fed whole mulberry leaves!" A day or two later, the Empress Dowager reminded me again. "It will be especially beautiful at that time, you must go and see!"</p>
<p>Ideally, the Empress Dowager herself must have gone to see this play of raising silkworms and reeling silk many times; since the garden raises silkworms every year, she must have seen it every year. But sometimes her behavior is really like that of a child. She is very interested in watching silkworm rearing, and seems to never tire of watching it ten or a hundred times. Whenever she has a little leisure from government affairs, she often thinks of going to see those spring silkworms that are growing day and night.</p>
<p>One day, the girls in charge of raising silkworms told me that a large number of young silkworms had grown up, and on that day they would start feeding them whole mulberry leaves. (271)</p>
<p>Small Knowledge</p>
<h3>Drinking Alcohol</h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>I am very fond of things in cups. My family has been in the Shaoxing wine business for generations since my great-grandfather, so my knowledge of wine is richer than that of anything else. Now I will talk about the level, advantages, disadvantages, and secrets of wine separately: (1) The level of drinking alcohol. If we drink alcohol and the blood absorbs one milligram of "ethyl" alcohol per 1.000, we will be drunk. When two milligrams are absorbed, we will be drowsy. When three milligrams are absorbed, we will cry, laugh, and talk wildly. When four milligrams are absorbed, the body loses its support. When five milligrams are absorbed, consciousness is completely lost. Beyond this, we will be poisoned, and some will die as a result. However, each person's alcohol tolerance is different. It doesn't matter if people with large quantities absorb more alcohol, because the stomach has been anesthetized to alcohol. That is, the blood can withstand the stimulation of three to four milligrams of alcohol, so even if it exceeds five milligrams, consciousness will not be completely lost; (2) The benefits of drinking alcohol. Generally speaking, drinking an appropriate amount of alcohol can increase the secretion of digestive juices, help with the digestion of food, and when the body is tired, drinking alcohol can help you sleep and calm your mind. If people with poor blood circulation and weak hearts drink alcohol, it can increase blood circulation and improve heart excitability, and promote the body's metabolism. In particular, Shaoxing wine and beer, because most of them are water and contain very little alcohol, do have the effect of increasing blood volume and promoting diuresis and bowel movements; (3) The harms of drinking alcohol. Since alcohol has such benefits, if you drink too much, it will also cause great harm. That is, because too much alcohol is ingested, it permeates delicate tissues, and various organs will change, destroying the digestive organs, nervous system, blood vessels, kidneys, heart, etc. Stomach ulcers, intestinal esophageal cancer, liver cancer, etc., are mostly caused by drinking too much alcohol. There are also those who increase blood pressure and develop arteriosclerosis, paralyze the brain, and even destroy brain tissue, and die from cerebral congestion. Moreover, the descendants of alcohol poisoning sufferers often have mental illness, idiocy, and other toxins. People who are usually stable in their behavior often show their true colors unconsciously after drinking too much alcohol, talking nonsense, and showing ugly態, which leads to a great loss of social credit. Matters of adultery, theft, fraud, and falsification often occur after drinking. If you try to drink strong alcohol such as shochu (sorghum, etc.), Scotch, and other foreign-produced alcohols, you will be poisoned by methanol, and you will immediately have a headache, dizziness, vomiting, swelling and pain in your limbs, and shortness of breath. Recently, the sorghum wine sold in the market, some unscrupulous merchants, in order to make huge profits, regardless of the lives of the public, actually mixed in a large amount of alcohol. Also, some Shaoxing wines are mixed with alcohol and pepper, etc., in order to deceive poor drinkers. If you drink this kind of wine, most of them will shorten your life. (4) The secrets of drinking alcohol. Before drinking alcohol, you should eat some bread, milk, or fatty foods, or drink a bowl of clear water, then it will not be easy to get drunk. If you drink alcohol on an empty stomach, the alcohol in the wine will be directly absorbed by the stomach, and you will get very drunk. When we have a banquet, we are afraid of being drunk by friends, we can first put some borax and citrus seeds in the mouth, then it can last a long time without getting drunk, or eat a few persimmons first (eat dried persimmons instead when there are no persimmons), and apples are especially good. If you are already drunk, you can decoct kudzu flowers and drink the soup, or decoct water chestnuts and pears, or smell ammonium water, and apply raw tofu to the heart, then you can naturally wake up. Eating persimmons is the most effective, because persimmons contain tannin, which can prevent alcohol absorption. If you have a headache from drinking alcohol, take sodium bicarbonate water or 1 gram of calcium lactate, mix it with warm water and drink it for a wonderful effect.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Improperly Revealing Wealth Before a Young Lady, Coveting the Wall for Color and Injury</p>
<p>Below this, she couldn't continue speaking, the tears streamed down like threads. Although Jia Duocai was very unwilling to see her act like this, luckily the money hadn't been stolen, so there was no need to make things too difficult for her, so he nodded and said: Someone came into my room to take money, that's like digging soil on the head of Tai Sui. You're really bold. But you've already begged for forgiveness, and I can't just make things difficult for you. Get up, first pick up all the silver dollars scattered on the ground, and then we'll talk. At this time, Yang Huanhua could only listen to others, she couldn't make things difficult herself, so she stood up and bowed, saying: As long as you forgive me, I'm willing to do anything. Please don't shout, save me some face. Jia Duocai nodded; Okay, I'll forgive you, you can rest assured and pick up the things, I'll ask you some questions. Pitifully, at this time, she didn't even dare to hum, crawled on the ground, picked up the silver dollars scattered on the ground one by one, stacked them up, and put them on the table. She said: Mr. Jia, why don't you count them? I don't know how much money you have. Is there anything missing now? Jia Duocai sympathized with her words, picked up the money, counted it one by one, and nodded: Only one dollar is missing. Yang Huanhua patted her lapels and said: I really didn't pick up yours. Jia Duocai raised his head slightly, pondered for a while, and said: Maybe it fell under the bed. You don't have to worry about it. You sit down, I'll ask you something. Yang Huanhua originally wanted to sit on his bed casually, but when she looked up at his expression, it was very tight and fierce, so she immediately withdrew and sat on a chair by the window. Jia Duocai seemed to still be afraid that she would leave, so he sat on the chair at the door. The woman lowered her head and pulled the hem of her clothes twice. Jia Duocai said: I have no kinship with you, no grievances or enmities. My money is on the table, it doesn't bother you at all. Why did you say that stealing my money was because you had no choice? What choice is there? (160)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Sound of Firecrackers, Tung Wah Seizes the Scota Cup, Triumphing Over French Commerce 5-2 in Overtime, a Dazzling Performance that Captivates 8,000 Spectators</h3>
<p>A Chinese Team Wins the Scota Cup for the First Time</p>
<p>The Scota Cup tournament, a special championship of the Western Union Football Association, has a history of over twenty years, yet no Chinese team has ever touched it. Previously, Lok Wah had only won the First Division League and the now-defunct Senior Cup. Their efforts for the Scota Cup over the years had not been successful. Since Tung Wah defeated French Commerce 5-2 at Shen Yuan yesterday, a Chinese team has finally tasted this new honor. The Scota Cup will now bear a new team name, which is something to celebrate for the Chinese football community.</p>
<p>The First Trophy</p>
<p>In this year's Scota Cup, Tung Wah sailed smoothly from the start of the competition. However, during the second round, they encountered a draw with Cracker, causing anxiety among Shanghai fans. After a second replay, Tung Wah was finally able to eliminate Cracker swiftly and decisively, thus obtaining the right to the final against French Commerce. As a result, hopes for the championship rose sharply. Yesterday, they met French Commerce at Shen Yuan for the final showdown. Tung Wah maintained the advantage throughout, charging straight at the enemy's heart, assuming it would be effortless. Unexpectedly, in the last two minutes, French Commerce tied the score at 2-2, putting the almost-secured Scota Cup in danger again. Fortunately, the entire team persevered and worked hard, scoring three consecutive goals in overtime. Amidst the firecrackers celebrating by the audience in the stands, Tung Wah defeated French Commerce 5-2, seizing the Scota Cup, an honor never before touched by Chinese teams, and savoring this new taste of victory.</p>
<p>The Audience Overjoyed</p>
<p>During the past week, the weather was mild and the spring sunshine was beautiful. It was expected that during this grand competition, Shanghai fans would flock to Shen Yuan Stadium, filling it to the brim. However, yesterday, the weather suddenly changed, with wind and rain. Although the clouds dissipated and the sky cleared by the start of the game, the audience was significantly smaller. Still, there were seven to eight thousand people, each bringing rain gear to the field in case of the unexpected. Sure enough, towards the end of the second half, dark clouds gathered again and it drizzled. The ordinary stands were completely covered by umbrellas. The ups and downs of Tung Wah's performance caused the emotions of the audience to fluctuate between surprise and joy. When Tung Wah finally achieved success, the audience released firecrackers and cheered thunderously. The joy of each person was indescribable. The performance of both teams was spectacular. Chan Hung-kwong came specially from Hong Kong to participate in this match, making Tung Wah's defense much more solid. Mr. Chan's efforts this season have made him the best forward talent among Chinese players at sea. His skill is profound and not accidental. The whole team worked seamlessly together, using extremely fast passing to attack the unprepared, truly worthy of being a championship team. French Commerce's strength was originally very strong, but their forwards could not cooperate, and their wings could not maneuver to help build momentum, which led to their defeat. Center-back Parker has become a figure of the past, slow and clumsy, insufficient to defend against the wolf-like Tung Wah forwards. The solidity of Tung Wah's defense was also a major reason why French Commerce's front line could not connect. Nevertheless, the excellence of both teams' performances left every spectator satisfied and kept them in a state of tension at all times.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Game Situation</p>
<p>In the first half, Tung Wah's Lee Yee-san only scored one goal against French Commerce. In the first ten minutes of the second half, Ka Yau-leung also scored one in the middle position, giving Tung Wah an absolute advantage with a score of 2-0, receiving warm congratulations from the audience. Unexpectedly, after this, Tung Wah abandoned its attack and focused entirely on defense, resulting in no further opportunities to win and being constantly under pressure from all sides, leading to concerns about the rear. This was Tung Wah's biggest mistake. As a result, French Commerce's Siao Wah-te broke through the goal, and then in the last two minutes, Ko Sa scored, tying the score at 2-2. This result, after such an absolute advantage, caused everyone to feel apprehensive. In overtime, fortunately, their momentum did not wane, and they continued their efforts, scoring three consecutive goals, finally achieving the final victory.</p>
<p>Missed Opportunities for Both Sides</p>
<p>When the game time arrived, Lee Yee-san of Tung Wah was nowhere to be seen. Referee Marshall ordered the start of the game, and only four Tung Wah forwards were fighting. Tai Lun-king kicked off first, but was intercepted by French Commerce's Bo Sa-te, who launched a counterattack. Ko La-sa and Ko Lai-te were very active, putting great pressure on Tung Wah's rear. Chan Hung-kwong saved Ah-do twice under the goal, earning much applause. Tung Wah escaped danger, and Tai Wan-yi led the troops to attack, with Ka Yau-leung assisting on the border, but the result was unsuccessful. After eight minutes, Lee Yee-san finally entered the field, and the two armies began a fierce battle, with wonderful moments aplenty. Bo Sa-te swept across the goal, and Ko La-sa countered from the right, the ball bouncing off the crossbar of the goal and flying out, causing extreme danger for Tung Wah. Yee-san passed the ball to Wan Cheung-wah in the center, Wan passed through Remy-di, Tai Lun-king rushed up to respond, wanting to shoot but was blocked. He then hooked the ball to the right, Ka Yau-leung rushed up and headed it, and Wah-te caught it safely, averting the danger.</p>
<p>Lee Yee-san Opens the Score</p>
<p>At this point, Tung Wah's offensive was extremely strong, and French Commerce only had the power to parry and no chance to counterattack. Parker was slow and there were loopholes in the middle, allowing Tai Lun-king to be very active. Tai and Lee connected and advanced, rushing to the goal, but the ball fell behind. At the same time, the enemy's Ma San-yi and Ngat Kuk-lokov also rushed forward with Lee and Tai, but they could not save the ball, and Lee Yee-san was the first to get it and shot it in, opening the record. Cheers erupted like spring thunder, and at the same time, firecrackers, paper flowers, and cushions flew all over the field. French Commerce, suffering this setback, attacked more fiercely than before. Bo Sa-te sent the ball from the corner position in front of the goal, turning into a right corner kick. After it was sent out by Favang-kiet, Ko La-sa attacked the goal twice without success. After this, both sides had opportunities, but both failed. Especially when Tai Lun-king was six or seven yards in front of the enemy's goal and attacked, it was most regrettable that the ball was saved by Ma San-yi.</p>
<p>Yau-leung Charges Alone into Enemy Territory</p>
<p>After the first half, French Commerce took a breath and showed a preemptive approach. Siao Wah-te sent out a beautiful corner kick. Lee Ning protected it effectively, breaking through the encirclement. After ten minutes, Ka Yau-leung took advantage of the opponent's internal emptiness, dribbling the ball alone. Ma San-yi chased after him, and when they reached the goal, Ka shot to the side of the goal, and the ball slowly rolled into the net. Goalkeeper Wah-te was distracted and unable to react, staring blankly. Tung Wah won the second goal. Yee-san also followed suit, charging alone into the enemy camp, winning a corner kick. Siao Wan sent it out, but Parker saved it. Wah-te sent it forward, Ko La-sa forced it to the penalty line, and Bo Sa-te shot very urgently. Luk Chung-en saved it from behind. Bo Sa-te replaced Siao Wah-te to kick the corner kick. Tung Wah had deep trenches and high fortresses, and French Commerce could do nothing. Later, Chen Ka-kau had a shot on goal once, with sufficient force, but it was wonderfully saved by the goalkeeper, earning endless cheers.</p>
<p>One Mistake Leads to a Tie</p>
<p>After this, Tung Wah suddenly changed its strategy, focusing on defense, intending to maintain the situation. Who knew that this was a big miscalculation, instead being attacked everywhere, giving French Commerce a full-force attack. Fung Wan-yau committed a foul 30 yards in front of the goal and was penalized. Remy-di gently passed to Ma San-yi, and Ma's shot turned into a corner kick. Favang-kiet sent it out, and Siao Wah-te headed it into the wild, missing the opportunity. After 35 minutes, Siao Wah-te got Favang-kiet's high ball and chased after it, heading it in. The ball landed and jumped into the goal. Luk Chung-en actually missed, and French Commerce pulled back a city. From then on, French Commerce's momentum became stronger and stronger. After five minutes, French Commerce suddenly surrounded the Tung Wah goal with all their forces, launching a continuous barrage. Tung Wah charged left and right, but could not break out of the encirclement. Favang-kiet got a chance to shoot at the goal, Luk Chung-en patted it out, and Ko La-sa returned a kick in the crowd, hitting a vital spot again, resulting in a 2-2 tie. The audience was stunned. When the center was kicked off, the 90-minute statutory time had arrived and overtime had to be extended to determine the winner.</p>
<p>Yee-san Cleverly Releases a Cold Arrow</p>
<p>After quenching their thirst with lemon, French Commerce took the initiative, with a turbulent momentum. Tung Wah was still in a state of pressure, waiting for an opportunity to launch an attack. Favang-kiet shot twice, both turning into wild balls. Tai Lun-king suddenly got an opportunity, charging alone, already in no man's land. At the appropriate point, Ma San-yi desperately rushed to catch up. Tai was anxious to shoot, but it turned into a wild ball, which was a pity. Soon after, Lee Yee-san passed a ball on the periphery. The French Commerce goalkeeper caught it, but because he wanted to avoid Tai Lun-king, he was penalized for walking four steps while holding the ball. The entire French Commerce team lined up under the goal. Tung Wah used a decoy tactic, first having Chen Ka-kau run forward, wanting to kick but instead pushing it backward. The French Commerce formation moved, and Yee-san pulled up a kick, and the ball flew into the bottom of the net. The timing was economical, and the strategy was ingenious. The audience applauded, and Tung Wah took the upper hand again.</p>
<p>Yee-san Builds Two More Achievements</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes, the teams exchanged positions again. Both sides drank like cows. When the referee blew the whistle to start the game, many more people from French Commerce were drinking madly outside the field. Seeing that the ball had been killed by Tung Wah in front of the goal, they hurriedly returned to the field like fish escaping the net. Ma San-yi saw that the situation was not good and kicked it into a corner kick. After Ka Yau-leung kicked it out, Chen Ka-kau shot first, and Yee-san added a kick, building another miraculous achievement. Tung Wah then had a firm grasp on the victory. In the last four minutes, with both sides exhausted, Lee Yee-san built another achievement, resulting in a 5-1 score, winning the Scota Cup. The award was presented on the spot by Grimshaw, president of the Western Union, and Luk Chung-en was awarded the cup, triumphing amidst the enthusiastic celebrations of the crowd. The members of the two teams who came out are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Luk Chung-en</p>
<p>Lee Ning Kwan Shun-on</p>

<h3>Western Union Football First Division Match: Yau Yau Decisively Defeats Western Police, a Score of Four to One</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, it was drizzling, intermittently, as if the football match would be postponed. It was not until 2:30 in the afternoon that the rain, though continuous, did not grow from small to large. Yau Yau and Western Police were finally able to perform one act of the Western Union First Division match in Hongkou Park as scheduled. The crowd of onlookers was quite enthusiastic, numbering no less than five or six hundred people. As a result of the match, Yau Yau took the lead with three to one in the first half, and Yau Yau scored another goal in the second half, winning a great victory with four to one.</p>
<p>Yau Yau Takes the Lead Three to One</p>
<p>At the start of the match, Yau Yau took the offensive. The forwards were extraordinarily sharp. In less than two minutes, Sun Kam-shun got the ball and shot powerfully, but the Western Police goalkeeper met it with a kick, and the ball bounced off Chen See-hoi's leg and into the net. Yau Yau fought more and more bravely. Lau Cho-yu sent a cross from the periphery, and Sun Kam-shun arrived in time, hooking the ball over, and the ball went in from the lower right corner. This ball was kicked with great skill. Before long, Hai Hau-sang attacked along the side and hit the mark again, gaining three goals. Western Police lost three goals in a row, and the whole army was indignant, so they poured out their troops for a counterattack. Finally, the center forward scored a goal, creating a score of three to one. After a long melee, the first half ended, and Yau Yau took the lead with three to one.</p>
<p>Yau Yau Triumphs with a Score of Four to One</p>
<p>In the midst of renewed fighting, Western Police tried hard to counterattack, exposing their edge. Within three minutes, Yau Yau was under pressure, but fortunately, Wang and Jiang, the two defenders, defended properly, and were able to turn the danger into safety. Later, Yau Yau tried to cheer up, and Sun Kam-shun and Chen See-hoi advanced side by side, swinging their iron legs, and it was heard that they had hit the mark again. However, Chung Yung-sam was offside and it was invalidated, which was a pity. Afterwards, the attack and defense were alternately successful, each with its own safety and danger. Yau Yau finally won with a score of four to one.</p>

<h3>Chung Wah Football Club: Yu Wah Wins the Championship Ticket of the Soccer Division, Defeating Kong Nam 4-3</h3>
<p>The Yu Wah Football Team has been victorious in every battle in the Chung Wah Soccer Division. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, they competed against the Kong Nam Team in a championship match at the Kong Nam Stadium. Although Yu Wah was missing key players Ka Yau-leung, Tse Kwai-shuen, and Ngan Ki-man, they still relied on the soldiers' dedication to defeat Kong Nam 4-3 and win the Soccer Division Championship.</p>
<p>Referee Tang Hoi-lan blew his whistle, and both sides lined up to fight. The Yu Wah Team was of one mind, pouring out their troops in a fierce attack. Left inside forward Yau Tin-sang took advantage of a gap to draw his bow, and the ball bounced out of the goalpost. Right wing Lau Tai-nam launched a rebellion, opening the record. Seeing that they had lost a goal, the Kong Nam Team launched a fierce counterattack. Yu Wah's right midfielder Yeung Kwai-sang was eager to defend the king, but was clumsy and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Yu Yiu-wah of Kong Nam kicked it in one go. Soon after, Yu Wah's left inside forward Luk Sau-yin dribbled the ball forward, and the Kong Nam defender failed to block him. He powerfully attacked the goal, and it went into the net in response. Kong Nam was furious and rushed to the meeting alone, returning with credit. In the first half, the two sides were tied with two to two, evenly dividing the colors.</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, Yu Wah's center defender Ng Sik-chuen was able to cleverly establish a meritorious service. Kong Nam was also unwilling to show weakness, scoring a goal from the left wing. At this point, Yu Wah's entire army was renewed and attacked again. Left inside forward Luk Sau-yin recklessly crashed into the net with both man and ball. In the end, Yu Wah triumphantly sang a song of victory with four to three. The attached lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Tze-leung</p>
<p>Tsun Pit-ko Cheung Siu-hing</p>

<h3>Teng Shuang's Coffin Was Placed Last Night After Being Murdered in a Love Triangle, Lu Ming Wept and Laughed Erraticly While Attending the Funeral</h3>
<p>The Murderer Lau King-kwai Will Be Transferred to the Court Today</p>
<p>Teng Shuang, the wife of Lu Ming, a well-known figure in the three-sport arena, was shot and killed by Lau King-kwai, as noted in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we continue to receive the full details from a telegraph and airmail letter. (Beijing, 17th) The murderer Lau King-kwai, who brutally killed Teng Shuang, will be transferred to the Public Security Bureau this afternoon and to the court on a specified day. Lu Ming, the protagonist of the tragic case, came to Beijing this afternoon to attend the funeral, weeping and laughing erratically. Teng's remains will be placed in a coffin tonight. (Beijing, 16th, airmail letter) Teng Shuang, the wife of Lu Ming, a veteran of the sports world, and a female teacher at Beijing Zhicheng Middle School, was suddenly shot and killed on the morning of the 16th by her romantic rival, Ms. Lau King-kwai, a very tragic situation that has shocked the city of Beijing. Details are listed as follows.</p>
<p>Lu Ming's Divorce, Engagement, and Marriage</p>
<p>Lu Ming is from Hsuanhua, 34 years old this year, and graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In 1930, at the National Games in Hangzhou, he won the shot put championship. After graduating in the summer of 1931, he served as an intern at the Engineering Office of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Bureau in Beijing. He is currently a civil engineer at the Xiahuayuan Station Engineering Office of the railway. In 1932, he fell in love with Lau King-kwai, a female student from Hsuanhua, and they became engaged. Then, during the North China Games, he met Ms. Teng Shuang, and favoring the new over the old, he terminated the engagement with Lau in the spring of 1933 and married Teng. Lau hated Lu and Teng to the bone, and always thought of assassinating them to vent her anger. The cause of the tragic murder was thus sown. Teng is from Hunan Zhaoyang, 29 years old this year, and graduated from Beijing Women's Normal University. She is known as a strong player in women's sports for her basketball skills. Chang Shi-gu, who works for the Shanghai Times, married Lu and continued to teach at Beijing Zhicheng Middle School for Girls. The murderer, Lau King-kwai, is from Hsuanhua, 24 years old this year. After graduating from Hsuanhua Women's Normal School, she worked as a teacher at a local elementary school. Last June, she came to Beijing to study at the Beihua Fine Arts School. Lau harbored resentment for the theft of her love. Unable to assassinate Lu, she attacked Teng. Seven Fridays ago, she went to Zhicheng Middle School with two male friends to visit Teng, but Teng did not meet them.</p>
<p>Details of Lau King-kwai Shooting Teng Shuang</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the morning on the 16th, Lau returned alone with a gun. When she arrived at the reception room, she claimed to be Lee Chen-hua, the aunt of Lee Siu-ying, a female student at the school, and said that she had something to discuss with Teng. After the receptionist informed Teng, Teng, unaware of the situation, agreed to meet her because she was a female guest. She was taken to the bedroom, and after they met, Lau asked Teng, "Are you Teng Shuang?" Teng said yes, and Lau immediately pulled out a gun and shot Teng, firing seven shots in a row, all hitting vital spots. Teng fell to the ground and died on the spot. At that time, the school was in session, and all 400 female students in the school were shocked and hurried out to check. They saw a fashionable woman walking out of Teng's bedroom. Running to Teng's room, they saw that Teng was lying in a pool of blood. They hurriedly told the maid, Wang Ma, to chase after the fashionable woman for questioning. Lau walked to the school gate, shouting to the police, "I killed someone!" The school policeman, Wen Yung-chuan, arrested her. Because he did not know the details, he hurriedly closed the school gate, conducted a major search, and telegraphed the district office.</p>
<p>Lau Confesses the Real Reason for Killing Her Romantic Rival</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, the Fourth District immediately sent the district chief, Lau Chen-chung, along with Wang Teh, the leader of the Fourth Detective Team, and many police detectives to the scene. They took Lau back to the district office for questioning. According to Lau's confession, her name is Lau King-kwai, she is 24 years old, from Hsuanhua, Chahar Province, and she is a first-year student at the Beihua Fine Arts School on No. 41, East Street. She did not know the deceased Teng Shuang. The reason for the shooting was that she had been engaged to Lu Ming in 1932. Later, because the deceased Teng Shuang had a romantic relationship with Lu, a love triangle formed, destroying her relationship with Lu Ming, causing her to be abandoned by Lu. After Teng published an engagement notice in the newspaper, they immediately got married. In this unfavorable environment, she went to Baotou to work as a teacher, and issued a warning letter, harboring thoughts of revenge. Last year, when she heard that Lu had come to Beijing to prepare for the Third National Sports Exhibition, she rushed to look for Lu but did not meet him. Later, with the guarantee of a fellow villager, she entered the Beihua Fine Arts School to study, spending her days reluctantly, hoping to find Lu Ming's whereabouts in order to take revenge. This was delayed until now. Finally, because of her weak ability, she was unable to fulfill her wish, so she made the plan to kill her romantic rival Teng Shuang first to relieve the hatred in her heart. She scouted Teng for many days, and today she finally got her wish for revenge. The pistol was bought from an unknown rickshaw puller for 84 yuan. She used the pseudonym Lee Chen-hua to plot the assassination, because Lee had been Teng's student, so that Teng would not be suspicious and would agree to meet her, and so on.</p>
<p>The District Chief Examines Teng's Corpse and Lau Is Imprisoned</p>
<p>After the interrogation, she was temporarily detained in the district office. District Chief Deng Chen-chung went to the scene of the corpse for inspection. He telegraphed the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau to inform the court to send someone to examine the corpse, and notified the deceased's family to come to the school to identify the body. At about 11 o'clock, Teng's old mother and younger brother, Shu-peng, rushed to mourn over the body and wept bitterly, a very tragic sight. The local court also sent Chang to the scene for inspection at 3:00 PM. As a result, it was found that Teng had been shot seven times. One bullet entered from the upper right breast and exited from the back. One bullet entered from the left neck and exited from the back of the neck. One bullet entered from the right ear and did not exit. There was also a bullet in the upper right neck that did not exit. The remaining three bullets all hit vital spots. At the time of the autopsy, Teng was wearing leather shoes, western-style pants, a white shirt, a vest, a cotton robe, and a blue cloth coat. She had a gold ring on her right hand and a small watch on her left hand. The bloodstains on her face were blurred and unrecognizable. During the examination, the Fourth District escorted the suspect Lau King-kwai to the scene of the corpse. The examining officer, Feng Kwong-yuk, questioned her about the beginning and end of the shooting. Lau was wearing a crimson wool coat, had short hair, wore glasses, and wore flat cloth shoes. Her attitude was calm and unafraid. After the examination, a certificate was issued, and the body was allowed to be carried away for burial. Lau was still detained in the Fourth District and was scheduled to be sent to the Public Security Bureau tomorrow (17th) for transfer to the court. The school paid 300 yuan to buy a coffin to dress and transport the body, and moved it to Fayuan Temple for temporary placement. According to Lau, Lu Ming had a wife. After she met him in 1932, their friendship improved day by day. Later, Lu asked to marry her, and she asked Lu to divorce his ex-wife first. Lu did not agree. Then, Lu met Teng Shuang at the North China Games. Later, Lu went to Hsuanhua Middle School to work and asked the chairman of the Hsuanhua Chamber of Commerce to act as a matchmaker to propose to Teng. Teng asked Lu to divorce his ex-wife. In January 1933, Lu officially divorced his ex-wife. In February, he paid her 600 yuan, saying that the previous relationship was cut off. She could not cope and endured the pain. So she decided to take revenge. In April of the same year, Lu married Teng in Hsuanhua. This time, she killed Teng Shuang to avenge the destruction of her marriage with Lu. The romantic rival is dead, and the hatred is over, etc.</p>
<p>Lau Carried a Letter to the People of the Nation</p>
<p>When Lau shot Teng, she carried a letter to the people of the nation. The original text is as follows: Elders and compatriots of the nation, be aware, I am now going to expose a person with a human face and a beast's heart for you to see. Speaking of him, people who usually pay attention to sports news probably know him, that is, Lu Ming, the shot put champion of this year's National Games. Alas, fortunately he is a shot put champion. If the number were bigger, I don't know what kind of evil he would create. He... Lu Ming, was originally a country bumpkin. His parents, eager for their son to succeed, used the money they earned from the sweat of their brows to support his education. Who knew that as soon as he entered the city, he had strange ideas. Because he had a little fame in the sports world, he tried his best to learn the ways of modern life. Alas, modern, modern, so many sins in the world are born because of this. The first problem hovering in his mind was that his wife was not sophisticated enough, so he wanted to play at having a second love. Running home, he ignored his parents' heartache and his wife's old love, and drove his own woman and child out of the house. The woman's family was a commoner, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. As a result, they finished the matter by demanding a little alimony. This is the trend of the times. You can freely divorce. This is nothing. After the divorce, he was busy pursuing a match. He tried one woman in the west and made overtures to another in the east. Because these things would harm the reputation of the ladies, I won't go into details. Finally, he met Ms. Teng in Zhangjiakou. This lady had a unique insight and actually fell in love with him. We can imagine the look of surprise on his face. But after not getting along for long, he wanted to change his mind with Ms. Teng. So he ran to Xuanhua in a puff of smoke, running around everywhere, asking friends to introduce him to women. He earnestly told people, "Foreign women are simply unreliable. If you want to marry and start a family, you should still marry a local woman. From now on, I will marry and start a family and no longer talk about love." Then he told everything about Ms. Teng in detail, to a point of perfection. His friends, hearing his sweet words, thought he was sincere, without any difference, so they thought of a way for him. One of them, who had taught me, introduced me to him. I have never been into socializing, so I didn't know anything about Lu Ming's history. But I trusted my teacher 100% and didn't make any mistakes, so I went to ask my uncle and a cousin for their opinion. They were all friends of Lu Ming. As a result, all parties agreed very much. Under the auspices of the elders, I became engaged to him. Unexpectedly, on November 1st of this year, I found the news of his marriage with Ms. Teng in the newspaper. When I got this news, I doubted him very much. Lu Ming was acting in the way, getting engaged to me and marrying another person. He gets engaged but doesn't marry, and he marries those who are not engaged. I don't understand his trick of bullying the weak. Soon he came to see me. According to him, "My marriage with Ms. Teng was forced by others and was never my own wish, so I still asked to fulfill the marriage contract with me." But I later learned that Ms. Teng agreed to bear part of his ex-wife's alimony. Oh, I understand. He wants to marry two women at the same time, but can I answer this request? He pleaded with me in tears and was rejected several times by me. He saw that his trick was not working well, so he asked someone to mediate the dissolution of the engagement. I didn't allow it either. How can I tolerate this kind of social parasite and beast in clothing? I have my own way. Okay, this is the shot put champion, who sold his love and his personality, and the person he deceived was actually his friend's student. I can't help but think of Chairman Lin's advice to sports to pay attention to morality. Lau King-kwai cries, December 27, 1933.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Organizes the Second Outstanding Student Friendship Sports Event</h3>
<p>First Friendship Meeting Held Yesterday, Attended by Over 1,000 Representatives from Various Schools, Tao Baichuan Explains the Meaning of Friendship, Wu Xingya and Shen Yi Attend and Give Speeches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters organized the Second Outstanding Student Friendship Sports Event for secondary schools. The first general meeting was held yesterday morning at 8:00 AM at the Lido Grand Theater on Beijing Road. Chairman Tao Baichuan, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya, and Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi attended and gave speeches to encourage the youth. Yu Zhongbiao, Wang Longzhang, and Lin Meiyan served as hosts. More than 1,000 students from various schools attended, creating an unprecedented scene. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Over 1,000 Students Participate</p>
<p>More than 1,000 students from over fifty schools participated in this friendship sports event, including Jingye, Wuben, Xinlu, Hujiang, Private Shanghai Middle School, Kindergarten Normal School, Mellen, Aiguo, Nanyang, Nanyang Model, Minli, Women's Minli, Lida, Junyi, Xinmin, Chengzhong, Minzhi, Shanghai Girls' High School, Qingxin, Yangjing, YMCA, Huadong, Zhirenyong, Huahua, Chizhi, Tongyi, Dagong, Chengdong, Zhengxing, Daozhong, Minzhi, Dongya, Wusong, Kunfan, Peiming, Huiqun, Guangxia, Hudong, Renhe, Cihang, Guangdong, Kaiming, Danhua, Xiaoming, and Guangdong East, with outstanding students from all grades.</p>
<p>Chairman Reports on the Meaning of Friendship</p>
<p>After the formalities, Chairman Tao Baichuan explained the meaning of the friendship sports event, stating that the purpose of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters holding the Outstanding Student Friendship Sports Event for secondary schools is to foster a close relationship between students and the Party. We know that youth are the future masters of the country, and secondary school students are particularly outstanding members of the youth. Due to the lack of universal education in China, only 470,000 people out of a population of 477 million receive secondary education, accounting for only one in a thousand of the total population. Therefore, the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters attaches great importance to secondary school students, as they are excellent members of the nation. The Kuomintang is leading the people in the work of revitalizing the Chinese nation, but this work is extremely arduous and cannot be accomplished by the efforts of a few people. We earnestly hope that young people can jointly shoulder this responsibility. Therefore, we are holding this friendship meeting today, aiming to provide middle school students with some political education in addition to military education, moral education, and production education, because we believe that these four types of education are equally important. At the same time, we want to make young people truly recognize that the Chinese nation will surely be revived because we can obtain a kind of proof in terms of time and generations. We also recognize that to revive our nation, we must implement the Three Principles of the People. We hope that through this friendship sports event, the feelings between young people and the Party will become closer.</p>
<p>Wu Speaks on the Responsibility of Youth</p>
<p>Next, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya gave a speech, stating that he was extremely happy to participate in the first friendship sports event of the second session because the students present were quiet and orderly, which has already achieved the neatness of the New Life Movement, making him deeply believe that the friendship sports event has been effective. He hopes that the achievements of the past can be further enriched in the future, with not only progress in form but also greater progress in spirit. Middle school students are excellent members of the youth, and we hope that middle school students will use this spirit to lead the people and jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, firmly believing that to revive the nation, we must implement the Three Principles of the People and start from the individual, following the principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame advocated by the New Life Movement, earnestly doing so to make the individual a healthy person. Gu Linqing once said, "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." If every individual must bear the responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation, then the responsibility of middle school students, who are outstanding members of the nation, is of course even greater. The Premier once divided the revolutionary process into three stages: "military government," "tutelage government," and "constitutional government." The most important of these three stages is tutelage government, and we earnestly hope that middle school students can replace the state in guiding a thousand people. Middle school students, you must know that the Kuomintang considers youth to be the soul of the Party, the lifeline, and the successors of the Party, hoping to jointly implement the Three Principles of the People, jointly save China, and revive the nation.</p>
<p>Shen Reports on Impressions of Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Finally, Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi reported on his impressions of traveling in Russia, stating that he took the opportunity to attend the International Engineering Conference convened in Germany and the Yellow River experiment to visit Soviet Russia. He stayed in Russia for about three weeks and had many impressions. He went there as an engineer to observe four aspects: (1) How the Five-Year Plan was generated, (2) Hydropower development in the Five-Year Plan, (3) How engineering talents are cultivated in Soviet Russia, (4) Municipal administration in Soviet Russia. What impressed him most was the diligence of Soviet Russian workers, peasants, and students. In Soviet Russia, one cannot survive without working, and one can only barely make a living through lifelong labor, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all extremely simple. However, the people of Soviet Russia have no resentment because they believe that building the country is the responsibility of the people. Therefore, the Five-Year Plan can be smoothly implemented, and the rulers of Soviet Russia set an example by living and dressing like ordinary people. Even Stalin only lives in two rooms. Other aspects, such as the strictness of school rules, the excellent academic atmosphere, and the absence of strikes, also impressed him. Workers also work hard, and strikes have never been seen in Soviet Russia. In addition, the committee system originated in Soviet Russia, but this system has now been changed because Soviet Russia believes that to promote construction, there must be a leader responsible, and his subordinates must obey. Soviet Russia is a country that loudly advocates world revolution, but once you enter the country, you only hear the sound of Soviet Russia, Soviet Russia, because they are working hard for their nation. The slogan of world revolution is just a slogan. Therefore, we have an impression that we must not forget ourselves and our roots. The current plan should be how to work hard for our country and our nation.</p>
<p>Screening of Films and Distribution of Gifts</p>
<p>After Shen's speech, a major film was screened, and the Newcomer Weekly Society distributed half-year subscriptions of the Newcomer Weekly to the students present. The Lido Grand Theater and the China Educational Film Association also provided excellent gifts, which were distributed to the students present. The meeting was adjourned around 1:00 PM after a group photo was taken.</p>

<h3>The Taxation Issue of Saigon No. 3 Rice</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Recently, discussions in newspapers have revolved around the issue of increased taxes on broken rice, which is, in fact, related to the tariff regulations for Saigon No. 3 rice. Initially, Saigon No. 3 rice was subject to a half-tax upon import because it contained broken rice up to 60%. However, due to the disparity between the full tax and the half-tax, the overseas market price was almost the same as the price of No. 1 rice. This contradicted the original intention of our country's tax reduction to benefit the poor, and it only enriched the foreign merchants who sell the rice. Thus, the question of whether to increase the tax arose.</p>
<p>The taxation of imported foreign rice was originally intended to protect the domestic rice production. If we were to consider the people's food needs, then we could simply continue the previous method of importing duty-free. However, since a tax is already being levied, the level of the tax should be assessed based on the nature of the taxed product itself. It is clear that Saigon No. 3 rice does not consist entirely of broken rice, even though broken rice accounts for 60% of it. Since it is not entirely broken rice, it still contains 40% of whole rice, and it is already unfair to tax it at half the rate for broken rice. Furthermore, Saigon No. 1 rice contains 25% broken rice, and No. 2 rice contains 40% broken rice, both of which are subject to the full tax (1.65 gold units per 100 kilograms). However, No. 3 rice, which contains 20% more broken rice than No. 2 rice, can have its tax reduced by 50% (0.83 gold units), which is too lenient on No. 3 rice and too harsh on No. 2 rice. This is why No. 2 rice has disappeared, while No. 3 rice sells so well. Therefore, based on the amount of broken rice it contains, Saigon No. 3 rice should be taxed at two-thirds of the full tax rate (1.1 gold units), even if it is not taxed at the full rate. In other words, at least one gold unit of import tax should be levied per 100 kilograms. As for rice that is entirely broken, it can be taxed at half the rate, similar to grains.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of market price, under normal market conditions, Saigon No. 3 rice is about one yuan cheaper than No. 1 rice and only five jiao cheaper than No. 2 rice. However, Dajiao rice is also about one yuan cheaper than Xiguan No. 1 rice, but it is still subject to the full tax. Similarly, Siamese No. 1 rice is about 1.5 yuan more expensive than Saigon No. 1 rice, but it is still subject to the same tax. Therefore, it is inconsistent to have a difference of only one yuan between Saigon No. 1 rice and No. 3 rice, while the tax rates differ by half. The differences in the prices of various types of foreign rice sold in the Shanghai market can be seen in the table below. However, the situation is different when there are major fluctuations in the market. These figures still refer to normal market conditions, and the differences are approximate figures. Saigon No. 1 rice is used as a standard only for the convenience of comparison. (Unit of market price difference: yuan)</p>
<p>Grade Above Market Price Difference Standard Grade Below Market Price Difference</p>
<p>Siamese No. 1 Rice 1.5 Saigon No. 1 Rice Saigon No. 2 Rice 0.5 Saigon No. 3 Rice 1.0</p>
<p>Siamese No. 2 Rice 1.0 Broken Rice 3.0</p>
<p>Siamese No. 3 Rice 0.5 Small Rice 0.5 Large Rice 1.0</p>
<p>The current market difference is about two yuan.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Saigon No. 3 rice is subject to the full tax, it becomes a matter of product classification, and the tariff regulations do not need to be changed. However, if it is necessary to differentiate slightly, then separate regulations must be added for different tax rates, such as:</p>
<p>Broken Rice (A) Containing 60% or more broken grains: 1.00</p>
<p>(B) Entirely broken grains: 0.83</p>
<h3>The Development of the Soviet Russian Grain Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jianzi</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>In Soviet Russia today, the establishment of a modern grain industry (Food Industry) is only a fact of the last three or four years. Before the war, generally speaking, Tsarist Russia did not have what could be called a grain industry. At that time, grain production was mainly completed by semi-manual factories, farmland, bakeries, and the like. It was only at the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan that Soviet Russia established many large grain factories with modern mechanical equipment. The production of these factories was large-scale. Because during this period, urban and industrial centers rapidly emerged, and many large industrial enterprises rose, the supply of grain gradually increased, and the factories engaged in grain production consequently needed to produce on a large scale. With the rise of new cities and newly established industrial centers, the labor population naturally increased day by day. At this time, the old small-scale grain production could not meet the needs of this ever-increasing population, which was only natural. For example, in 1926, there were 31 Soviet Russian cities with a population of around 100,000. By 1931, the number of cities with such a population had increased to 46, while the number of cities with a population of around 10,000 was 479 in 1926 and increased to 507 by 1931. Furthermore, the increase in the general population's purchasing power (Purchasing Power) in Soviet Russia and the improvement of cultural standards (Cultural Standard) naturally resulted in a demand for high-quality and various different grain products.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1930, the various sectors of the grain industry formed a unified entity under the command of the Domestic Grain Supply Department (The Commissariat for Internal Supply). With the rapid development of industry, the work of the Domestic Grain Supply Department greatly expanded, exceeding the capacity of one department. Therefore, in July 1934, the Domestic Grain Supply Department was divided into two departments—one in charge of domestic trade and one in charge of the grain industry.</p>
<p>During the period of large-scale agricultural collectivization (Intensive Collectivization), livestock were slaughtered wholesale, which led to a shortage of meat and dairy products, thereby hitting the development of the grain industry. Moreover, due to inconvenient transportation and a lack of transport facilities, the development of the grain industry faced various difficulties. Despite these setbacks and difficulties, from an overall perspective, the Soviet Russian grain industry slowly developed year after year.</p>
<p>In 1933, the total output value of the Soviet Russian grain industry reached 6 billion rubles, which was 3.5 times greater than the total value in 1928. The grain production volume in the first half of 1934 was 24% greater than in the same quarter of 1933. As for the output of canned food and confectionery, the increase was surprisingly large. In 1933, the output of canned food was eight times greater than the figure five years earlier, and the output of confectionery was no less than five times greater than the figure five years earlier. Other new products, such as artificial milk (Margarine) and canned milk, began to be manufactured in the past few years.</p>
<p>In the 1933 grain production, the grain industry under the command of the Chinese Domestic Grain Supply Department was worth 4,836 million rubles, while the grain production under the jurisdiction of the Procurement Committee of the Council of People's Commissars—mainly the production of flour mills—was worth 1,160 million rubles.</p>
<p>As for the supply of grain raw materials (Row Materials), due to the rapid development of large-scale state and collective farms, the amount of various agricultural products entering the market also increased considerably. These agricultural products included grains, sugarcane, potatoes, and various vegetables. Furthermore, various cooperatives (Cooperatives) emerged, and transportation facilities and vehicles were greatly improved. Today, large-scale socialized restaurants (Restaurants) are established throughout Russia. The formation of this restaurant network has alleviated the various difficulties in grain distribution. More important in terms of grain distribution is the close establishment of grain distribution centers. The purpose of these centers is to supply food to laborers working in special industrial enterprises.</p>
<p>From 1928 to 1933, the total amount of capital invested in the grain industry was 3 billion rubles, while in the same period from 1924 to 1928, the amount of capital invested in the grain industry was only 500 million rubles. The former was six times greater than the latter. Most of this capital was used to build new, large grain production factories. The construction and equipment of these factories were based on the most modern architecture and equipment, especially using American technology (American Technique) to a great extent. In the past five years, more than 700 new grain industry factories have been built and put into production. The machinery and mechanical equipment installed in these new factories were all imported from foreign countries.</p>
<p>(2) Construction of a Modern Grain Industry</p>
<p>Before 1929, meat packaging (Meat-packing) was carried out in old slaughterhouses, without refrigerating equipment (Refrigerating Equipment) or facilities for manufacturing meat by-products. However, since 1929, Soviet Russia has established 110 large meat packaging plants and renovated many old slaughterhouses to be used not only for slaughtering livestock but also for manufacturing sausage products (Sausage Products), fat products, and bristles. At the end of 1928, the basic capital (Basic Capital) invested in the meat packaging industry was 60 million rubles, which increased to 350 million rubles by the end of 1933.</p>
<p>Today, Soviet Russia has two of the largest meat packaging plants, one in Moscow and one in (Srednaya Rogatka) near Leningrad. The second Five-Year Plan further stipulates the construction of a sausage factory this year and the construction of other secondary meat factories. Due to the establishment of new meat manufacturing plants and the equipment of modern mechanical equipment, the number of cattle slaughtered increased from 55% to 73.5% from 1930 to 1933. By 1934, it had further increased to 76%.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, Soviet Russia only had 22 canneries (Canning Industry), with a total annual output of 100 million cans. By the end of 1932, the number of canneries had increased to 488, with a total annual output of 1 billion cans. Some of the newly established canneries can be considered the largest canneries in the world, with each having a total annual output of 90 million to 100 million cans. In the newly built canneries, all labor processes are mechanized, and the organization of the production process adopts a conveyor system (Conveyor System). As for the canned milk industry, it also began after 1932. Today, several canned milk factories, based on the latest American technology, have been completed. Among the many newly manufactured head-out products, there are also canned foods such as corned beef (Corn), tomatoes, pork, and soybeans.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia has also established new flour mills and sugar factories with modern equipment. Some of these flour mills and sugar factories are located in areas where industry was not well developed in the past, such as Kazakstan, Siberia, and the Far East. Production only began in 1930. There are also many other new factories that have recently begun to be established to manufacture vermicelli and spaghetti (Spaghatti and MaCaroni), confectionery, non-alcoholic beverages, starch and molasses, cured meat products, soy milk, and the like. From 1929 to 1932, there were seven large sugar refineries with a daily refining capacity of 85 to 340 tons of refined sugar. Artificial milk production is also concentrated in seven large factories, each with a total annual output of 6,000 tons to 20,000 tons. The number of mechanized large bread manufacturing factories in 1930 was 67, with a daily manufacturing volume of 4,400 tons. By 1933, the number of bread factories had increased to 221, and the manufacturing volume had also increased to 13,500 tons. Fifty-eight new large baking plants (Baking Plants) were added, baking 3,650 tons of bread per day. In addition, there were 169 small baking plants. The total bread output in 1933 reached 5,700,000 tons, and the plan for 1934 stipulates that the total bread production must reach 7,100,000 tons. Therefore, Soviet Russia's bread can no longer be restricted.</p>
<p>Fish occupies a very important position in the Soviet Russian domestic grain market. As a result of the establishment of cold storage plants and canneries in recent years, the Soviet Russian people have a supply of fresh fish or canned fish in addition to the supply of dry fish or salted fish (Dry or Salted fish). Before the war, dry fish or salted fish became the main part of the Soviet Russian people's fish supply, but now it has been replaced by the supply of fresh fish or canned fish. The source of Soviet Russian fish supply occupies an important position in the world. Even before the war, Tsarist Russia's fishing industry used old-fashioned methods, but its fishing industry still did not lose its important life in the world. In 1930, the total output of Soviet Russian fish even exceeded 30% of the total output before the war, and it also exceeded the fish output figure stipulated in the last year of the first Five-Year Plan. From the perspective of the fishing industry, Soviet Russia now ranks second in the world. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the total capital invested in the fishing industry was more than 350 million rubles, and this capital was mainly used to build cold storage and canneries. The mechanical equipment of cold storage and canneries were all purchased from foreign countries, and most of them were purchased from the United States. The main center of the fishing industry is the Volga Caspian region, which accounts for about half of the total Soviet Russian fish production. However, the Arctic-white sea and Far East fisheries are gradually increasing their importance by engaging in deep-sea fishing (Deep-Ses fishing). From 1913 to 1933, the development of the Soviet Russian fishing industry increased from 17% to 34.5%. The percentage increase cannot be said to be very small.</p>
<p>(3) The Second Five-Year Plan and the Grain Industry</p>
<p>The second Five-Year Plan stipulates the establishment of many new factories in various sectors of the grain industry. During the five years from 1932 to 1937, the capital invested in the grain industry is stipulated to be 5.34 billion rubles. Of this amount, 495 million rubles are stipulated for the meat packaging industry, 900 million rubles for the fishing industry, 1.1 billion rubles for the sugar industry, 110 million rubles for the confectionery industry, 1.83 billion rubles for the canning industry, and 300 million rubles for the cheese industry. The total output value of the grain industry is stipulated to increase by 256% in 1937 compared to 1932. During the second Five-Year Plan period, the new planned developments of the main items of the grain industry are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Product Unit 1932 1937</p>
<p>Meat Thousand tons 435 1,200</p>
<p>Fish Thousand tons 1,333 1,800</p>
<p>Sugar Thousand tons 826 2,500</p>
<p>Artificial Milk Thousand tons 39 120</p>
<p>Canned Food Million cans 716 2,000</p>
<p>Butter Thousand tons 65 180</p>
<p>Cheese Thousand tons 35 37</p>
<p>Flour Thousand tons 8,102 14,40</p>
<p>Confectionery Thousand tons 572 1,500</p>
<p>Macaroni Thousand tons 195 560</p>
<p>Salt Thousand tons 2,659 6,000</p>
<p>Cigarettes Billion rolls 67 140</p>
<p>Alcoholic Beverages Hectoliters 3,648 7,500</p>
<p>Wine Hectoliters 4,179 7,500</p>
<p>Non-Alcoholic Beverages Hectoliters 6,075 16,000</p>
<p>During the second Five-Year Plan period, Soviet Russia should establish another 17 meat packaging plants. Of this number, a portion has now been completed and will begin meat packaging work. In addition, 23 new packaging plants should be established, with an annual output of 541,000 tons and a construction cost of 620 million rubles. It is also stipulated that 23 new canneries should be established. The construction cost is estimated to be 118 million rubles, and the annual output is stipulated to reach a total of 523 million cans. The annual output of powdered milk (Powdered milk) should reach 1,250 tons. By the end of 1938, Soviet Russia will have 30 new sugar refineries that can refine 29,000 tons of sugarcane. It is further stipulated that 8 starch and molasses factories, 20 macaroni factories, 43 confectionery factories, and 73 cold storage plants should be established.</p>

<h3>The Food Problem in British Malaya</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhong</p>
<p>The Malay Peninsula in British Malaya in Southeast Asia, shaped like a crane's neck, extends straight out between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, bordering Siam to the north, the China Sea to the east, and the Strait of Malacca to the west, connecting with the Indian Ocean. It is 435 miles long and 200 miles wide at its widest point. The attached islands are scattered like stars, and the most important ones are Singapore and Penang Island. The total area is 52,595 square miles, roughly the same as Java in the Dutch East Indies. Among the islands, the largest in area is Pahang, with 14,000 square miles; the smallest is Penang Island, with only 100 square miles. The highest point of the Malay Central Mountains is Mount Tahan, reaching 7,200 feet. The mountain range runs from north to south, slightly curved, so the terrain is divided into east and west, and the rivers flowing east and west are more numerous than those flowing north and south. Except for the Pahang River, the rivers are not very large, and the smaller ones only allow rafts. The important seaports are Singapore and Penang Island. Two-thirds of Malaya's foreign trade passes through Singapore. Although Penang Island opened its port earlier than Singapore, its geographical advantage has declined day by day.</p>
<p>Although Malaya is known as an agricultural country, nineteen out of ten of the rice needed for food in the country are imported from Siam, Burma, and Vietnam. The total area of rice cultivation in Malaya is 675,000 acres, and the grain yield is about 157,800,000 gallons. The year before last, the weather was good, and the grain harvest was abundant. The area and yield of rice-producing areas are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Country Area (acres) Grain yield (thousand gallons)</p>
<p>Perak 106,970 27,257</p>
<p>Selangor 28,810 5,348</p>
<p>Negeri Sembilan 34,390 10,000</p>
<p>Pahang 43,990 8,232</p>
<p>Total 214,160 Total 50,837</p>
<p>(The table above is based on the 1932 report of the Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements Government)</p>
<p>If divided into paddy and dry rice, paddy rice accounts for more than 80% of the total planted area. If divided by production area, the rice-producing areas do not belong to the countries of the Malay Federation. The Malay natives knew how to grow rice in the past, and the soil is not unsuitable for growing rice, so why has it not become a rice-producing area? The reasons can be traced back to the following two points: (1) The number of natives is too high, and their nature is not fond of farming. In addition, the profit of rice is low, which is far less than planting rubber, a money-making tree. (2) The local government's economic policy is biased towards foreign capitalists and does not pay much attention to the improvement of rice varieties. The Malay people are very complex, with a total population of about 3,350,000 (overseas Chinese account for 30% to 40%). The amount of food needed by each person per year varies depending on the country and race. For a general adult, the average annual requirement is 1,000 pounds of solid food. If calculated based on arable land, each person gets less than one-tenth of an acre. Therefore, Malaya must import more than 50 million yuan of foreign food every year. Since the food panic in Malaya in 1919, the government has deeply felt the importance of Malaya's self-sufficiency in rice and has adopted an active policy of self-sufficiency in rice cultivation. The current area of rice cultivation in Malaya, with more than 600,000 acres as mentioned above, is all thanks to the forced rice cultivation. In addition to the Agricultural Affairs Bureau's many incentives, the Malay Federation's rice production also has a Food Production Management Committee to guide all food problems in order to achieve Malaya's complete self-sufficiency in rice production. However, in 1933, Siam rice imported into Singapore amounted to 414,666 tons. During the same period, Burma rice imported into Malaya totaled 335,451 tons, and Vietnam rice imported totaled 15,788 tons. Among Malaya's imports, in addition to all industrial products, rice is still the main one. This is a major shortcoming in the foreign trade of Malaya, which is known as an agricultural area.</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Market Trended Weakly</h3>
<p>From March 11th to 16th of last week, the overall trend of the Chinese Securities Exchange was the opposite of the previous week. Although still amidst the fluctuations of international loans and local syndicate credit borrowing, various international parties had their own agendas, restraining and influencing each other, making cooperation impossible and independent action inconvenient. As a result, the atmosphere gradually shifted from dense in the morning to weak. Initially, there was only lip service without actual support, followed by a complete lack of communication, leading to depression. Domestic credit borrowing syndicates, while a drop in the bucket, were also difficult to implement due to the refusal of money houses to participate. Given the current tightness of money supply, the decline of commerce, and the urgent need for funds, akin to hoping for rain during a severe drought, the public debt market was in a state of uncertainty and fluctuation. Its elasticity was entirely controlled by this situation. Currently, opinions still differed, and we were in a transitional period. Once the transition began, public debt would inevitably experience significant shocks, either surging or plummeting, depending on whether there was hope for a recovery in the money supply. Over the past week, the selling of the No. 4 bond was the most consistent, followed by active trading in the No. 53 bond, which showed an advance before retreating. The No. 121 bond showed a retreat before advancing. The rest mostly floated with the market. The overall trend was one of fluctuation, gradually weakening and turning downwards. Daily trading was light, with only Monday and Tuesday being lively. Price fluctuations were generally within half a yuan. Only Saturday saw a steeper decline. The future might not immediately see a rapid fall, but without improved conditions or preparations for a short squeeze, it would be difficult to trend upwards. The weekly market results showed that only the current month contracts of the Compilation Legacy 19th issue, Shansi 22nd issue, and Golden Long bond performed well, increasing by five fen to two jiao. The rest all trended downwards, ranging from one or two jiao to one yuan and two jiao. The total transaction volume was 66,848,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>

<h3>US Utility Stocks Fall to New Lows</h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Trading Company states that yesterday (March 16th) the New York stock market showed mixed and weak performance. President Roosevelt has approved the Federal Communications Commission to investigate the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and other interstate transportation companies. American Telephone and Telegraph fell to a new low for the year, making it difficult for the stock market to rally. Company officials did not criticize this matter, and reliable sources say they welcomed the investigation. The market continues to be dominated by foreign exchange. The Belgian franc plummeted seven pounds per ounce to 23.28. Foreign exchange was affected, and the French franc fell to the import point. It is now profitable to ship gold from France to the United States. The British pound rose due to the continued transfer of funds from continental Europe to London. The exchange rate of the US dollar against gold standard currencies continued to rise, and it also continued to fall against the British pound. The bond market was stagnant and stable. The market sentiment for stocks on the smaller exchanges was still stable. Half-day trading volume was 300,000 shares.</p>

<h3>Grain: Su Tong Late Rice Settled</h3>
<p>(Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups were scarce, with only about twenty arrivals, totaling over three thousand shi of goods. The sales market saw a slight stabilization in sentiment due to the cloudy weather, and the local market was more active. Therefore, the price of Su Tong late rice has settled. However, the early rice and thin rice markets were oversupplied due to significant accumulation in the Pudong area, and thin rice packages, with the week approaching, remained scarce, leading to continued depreciation of several fen to nearly a jiao. The price of Du Jian rice remained relatively stable. The price of Yin Yuan rice also remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Cotton and Yarn: US Cotton Under Bearish Pressure</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was entirely under bearish pressure. At the opening, due to foreign selling and profit-taking by bulls, all months fell by 12 to 19 points. Trading paused briefly for short covering, but ultimately continued downwards due to a lack of buyers. The closing was flat. The spot price fell by 30 points, and the futures price fell by 22 to 28 points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices falling by 10 points and futures prices rising by 5 to 6 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<p>According to a report from the New Fong Yang Hang New York agent, there are rumors that the transaction tax may be abolished. There are also reports that the South is agitating for a reduction in the tax rate and the cessation of artificial price fixing and the 1.25-cent loan. Government engineers claim that there is no risk of flooding in the Mississippi River this year. According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the eighteenth of White Luo Creek cotton is 222 rupees, down 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>

<h3>A History of the Evolution of Public Health</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Zhu Jiqing, Director of the Department of Health Education, National Health Administration (Notes by Cheng Xinliang)</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>To discuss the evolution of public health, we must first discuss the beginning of the universe, the evolution of society, and the changes in medical concepts. This is because public health is a type of human culture and a product of social evolution. Therefore, this article will first discuss the beginning of the universe, then the evolution of society, then the changes in medical concepts, and then the evolution of public health. The author's intention is to provide a reference for everyone on the evolutionary process of public health. As for who invented what in a certain year, that is not within the scope of the author's thoughts and will be omitted.</p>
<p>We know that historical records contain a very long time and a collection of experiences from many, many people. Right and wrong, gains and losses – by reading historical records, we can turn the experiences of the ancients into our own. We can save ourselves a lot of travel, which is called taking shortcuts or catching up.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who study or actually engage in public health must know the history of public health and all related matters.</p>
<p>(2) The Beginning of the Universe</p>
<p>In the beginning of the universe, in the so-called chaotic opening, heaven and earth were just fixed. The light and clear air floated upwards to become the sky, and the heavy and turbid air condensed downwards to become the earth. At this time, the universe was vast and swirling. Gradually, semi-solid objects in the atmosphere were discarded and separated, forming the sun, planets, moon, earth, etc. ...</p>
<p>At this time, the earth was as hot as fire, making it impossible for life to exist. After a considerable period of time, the earth's surface gradually cooled due to prolonged contact with the air, and living beings could then inhabit it.</p>
<p>The first animals were single-celled animals. There is simply nothing to record at this time.</p>
<p>After another considerable period of time, humans gradually evolved and developed clothing, food, housing, transportation, marriage systems, and clan concepts... This of course took a very long period of time, not just hundreds or thousands of years.</p>
<p>We have calculated the evolutionary process below. (These are approximate figures.)</p>
<p>Humans have existed in history for 300,000 years.</p>
<p>After another 280,000 years or so, humans began to be aware of themselves.</p>
<p>Around 295,000 years later, humans had rudimentary culture.</p>
<p>About 2,000 years ago, human culture had made considerable progress. It was not until 300 years ago that humans entered the age of science and enjoyed its gifts.</p>
<p>(3) The Evolution of Society</p>
<p>When humans first appeared, they were no different from other animals. We have no way of knowing what the initial living conditions of humans were like. Let us only say that when there was written record, the first issue was the problem of food, the so-called eating raw meat and drinking blood. Once the problem of food was solved, but the body was not covered and was cold – the skin had already degenerated, the so-called leaves in summer and hides in winter. The problem of clothing was also solved. Then they were busy with the problem of housing, the so-called building beams with wood to protect against wind and rain. The problem of housing was also solved. Humans are, after all, evolving. What about floods, fierce beasts, and other unforeseen events? So humans thought of ways to defend against danger, such as living in groups, using stones as weapons, and forming a baojia model. The problems of food, clothing, and housing were solved for humans, and the dangers were also reduced. So they thought about plans to propagate the race, because they wanted to pass it down forever and maintain their own interests. Therefore, there were so-called marriage systems, clan concepts... At this time, culture was already quite impressive. However, marriage systems and clan concepts... are ultimately narrow cultures. Evolved humans are not limited by them. Humans in society are so interconnected. Everyone has direct and indirect responsibilities to fulfill, each making their own contribution to society and the public. This is the social era we have now reached.</p>
<p>(4) The Relationship Between Medicine and Society and the Changes in Concepts</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship Between Medicine and Society. Since society has suddenly evolved to this degree, it is needless to say how complex and dense it is. Medicine and society naturally have an interconnected and inseparable relationship. If humans did not have medicine, they would simply be destroyed. Without medicine, there would be no health, they would get sick, and there would be no humans. Would there still be culture? Naturally, the medicine I am talking about is the entire science of protecting and promoting human health, not a simple and passive medical treatment that takes disease as its object.</p>
<p>(2) Changes in Medical Concepts in China. Can be divided into three periods.</p>
<p>(1) Passive Period. Since the dawn of society in our country until now, about 4,000 years, it has been in a passive period. How can I say this? Because during this time, there was no epidemic prevention, no health care. The so-called medicine was all about taking disease as its object. Being able to cure a disease was a famous doctor. Moreover, treating a disease was only a part of the treatment. There was no so-called physiology or pathology. In short, all medicine that takes disease as its object is passive medicine.</p>
<p>(2) Transitional Period – Approximately from 200 years ago to the present. Humans have been baptized by science and have realized the true value of medicine. It is not simply a passive medicine that takes disease as its object to cure diseases. Is it over after seeing a doctor? There are still so many people who are half-dead and half-healthy. Therefore, the true value of medicine is to contribute to humanity with the entire science of health.</p>
<p>However, for 5,000 years, a deeply rooted society has not thoroughly understood medical concepts. The position of passive medicine in society is even more unbreakable. Wanting to cut the knot with a sharp knife and turn the passive into the active in one breath is practically impossible. Otherwise, there may be bloodshed. Intelligent humans have come up with a compromise solution. This solution is the transitional period. On the one hand, the passive is transformed into an active process, and on the other hand, bloodshed is avoided. This period is divided into four steps. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Hygiene of the Skin and Prevention of Skin Diseases (3)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Having discussed the general precautions for preventing skin diseases above, I will now talk about the local hygiene methods for the skin. The first is the method of cleaning the skin. Cleansing or bathing the skin with cold or hot water. Because water can cause the stratum corneum of the skin to expand, making it soft. Therefore, it can remove waste from the epidermis. At the same time, sweat, sebum, dust, etc. adhering to the skin can also be removed. Hot water is more effective than cold water. There is a type called hard water, which contains limestone and magnesium salts. Therefore, it can irritate sensitive skin, making it rough. Therefore, people with insufficient facial sebum should be prohibited from using it. If it is necessary to use it, it is best to add some borax or honey to the boiled water. If you encounter skin with excessive sebum (seborrheic), washing with hard water is actually convenient.</p>
<p>The temperature of hot water has an effect on the regulation of skin temperature. Therefore, it stimulates the nerves of the skin, making physiological functions hyperactive. However, excessive temperature may be an obstacle, which should not be ignored. Conventionally, ordinary body temperature is the standard. A little higher (35-36 degrees Celsius) is also harmless. When bathing, washing with soap can completely clean the skin. It is also good to add some sugar juice to the bath. Also, when bathing, gently scrubbing the skin of the whole body with a soft brush, and drenching the whole body with cold water when leaving the bath, can be applied according to personal preferences. However, one thing to note is that after leaving the bath, the skin should be wiped slightly vigorously with a dry towel, which should not be forgotten. If the skin is low in sebum and rough, you can also apply a very thin layer of fats all over the body after drying.</p>
<p>Although there are various benefits to bathing as mentioned above, excessive bathing can easily cause physical weakness, causing the skin to lose sebum and become rough. On the contrary, it is easy to catch a cold. Therefore, the frequency of bathing must vary according to individual circumstances. It should be done once every two or three days. When bathing, for the sake of thorough cleaning, some rice bran juice and soap can be used as mentioned above. For those whose occupations easily make their bodies unclean, bathing daily is also appropriate.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are medicinal baths and hot springs. Doctors often put various medicinal liquids into the bath water to treat skin diseases, and have patients bathe in it. The medicine used naturally varies depending on the condition. It is not possible to list them all one by one. Now, I will briefly describe the hot springs that are commonly used by ordinary people, which are mineral springs and medicinal springs.</p>
<p>Originally, apart from epidermal peeling or injury, it is difficult for cold and hot water to freely penetrate into the skin. Therefore, although bath water contains various medicines, it is difficult for it to pass through the skin and be absorbed into the body. Although those who study hot springs say that cold and hot water can penetrate to some extent, the amount is always extremely small and insignificant. Some people overbelieve in the efficacy of hot springs and often bathe themselves without asking about the type of disease. Although the medicinal effect they obtain is not as great as they hoped, most hot spring areas have beautiful mountains and rivers, clean air, and beautiful and quiet scenery, which can be pleasing to the eye. Moreover, because of daily bathing, blood circulation is good, metabolism is vigorous, and gases generated in mineral springs are inhaled, which is certainly suitable during the recovery period of the disease. It is also a good way for healthy people to maintain their health. However, as mentioned above, the idea that the various components in hot springs can be absorbed into the body and exert their effects is really an overbelief.</p>
<p>The above is what healthy people feel about hot springs. But it is different for people with skin diseases. It is natural that the various medicines contained in hot springs can directly contact the skin and have therapeutic effects. But there is an advantage and a disadvantage. Because people without medical knowledge really do not know what kind of skin disease is suitable for what kind of hot spring. This kind of judgment is really difficult. Therefore, for the purpose of recuperation, going to a hot spring bath must be done under the guidance of a specialist doctor. Because there are several types of skin diseases that are immediately irritated by mere contact with water, making the condition worse. Moreover, the temperature in the hot spring is high, and it also contains various medicines, which can irritate the skin, making the condition worse more easily. Therefore, when we treat skin diseases, we often encounter</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>a type of acute dermatitis. Its source is the result of forgetting to enter a high-temperature hot spring bath. Erosion and epidermal peeling occur in the armpits, thighs, or other parts. At the same time, the affected area deteriorates, and many people suffer pain instead.</p>
<p>Mineral springs vary in composition. For example, some contain "alkali" salts, some contain sulfur, some contain salt, carbonic acid, iodine, boric acid, or iron, etc. Among them, the most effective for the skin is sulfur springs. But the same sulfur springs also vary depending on the temperature and type of sulfur, such as simple hydrogen sulfide springs, alkali sulfur springs, salt sulfur springs, and various others. In short, the sulfur in sulfur springs can be converted into alkali sulfide upon contact with the skin. It can soften and dissolve the skin. At the same time, it can also calm pain and itching. It also has a bactericidal effect. Therefore, the application of sulfur spring baths should be used sparingly for acute skin diseases to be safe. Because it is easy to stimulate. Conversely, for stubborn and difficult-to-treat chronic skin diseases, and when drug treatment is not effective, sulfur springs and soda springs can be used as a treatment method.

<h3>Current Status of Medical and Health in Songjiang</h3>
<p>— Fu Jiren</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Songjiang (also known as Rongcheng) is the old prefectural seat, bordering a tributary of the Huangpu River. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway passes through the south of the city, making it a major station and an important place in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The soil is fertile, and the people and things are abundant. Together with the nearby Jinshan, Fengxian, and Nanhui counties, it is a cotton-producing area, and the production of rice and silk is particularly large. The four-gilled perch produced in the Xiuye Bridge River in the west of the city is even more famous. In terms of transportation, there is now the Shanghai-Songjiang Motor Road, starting from Malu Bridge in the west of the city, which can directly reach the Nanshi Difangting in Shanghai. There are also waterways extending in all directions, so the market is also prosperous, especially since it is close to Shanghai, and all the bad habits of the city can be seen everywhere. However, it is a pity that the road administration is not repaired, the streets are narrow, and they are unbearably dirty!</p>
<p>(2) Health Administration</p>
<p>The health administration of this county is handled by the Second Section of the County Public Security Bureau, that is, the Administrative Section also serves as the Health Section. It is in a supervisory position, while the actual work is done by various district offices. Its facilities can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(A) Cleaning - In terms of cleaning, garbage cans are set up in urban and remote areas. In addition, cleaners are assigned to sweep the streets and dump garbage every day. Cleaners are hired by the town office - a subordinate department under the district - and supervised by the Public Security Bureau. (B) Organization of Sanitary Police - Every summer, the Public Security Bureau specially establishes a type of sanitary police, who do not care about the police affairs in the bureau. They specialize in inspecting all unclean objects in the city, such as street cleaning, food hygiene, and guiding sanitary facilities and managing garbage cans in tea houses, theaters, public toilets, etc. (C) Epidemic Prevention - Every summer, a temporary epidemic prevention hospital is established, which is also run by the county hospital. Its funding is raised locally. The hospital provides free vaccinations and dispatches doctors and nurses to various agencies to administer vaccinations. It also prepares isolation wards to accommodate patients, for a period of three months.</p>
<p>The County Public Education Center is responsible for publicity. The methods are divided into lectures, written words, and pictures. The main point is to instruct the public on common sense of public health, prevention of personal diseases, etc. In terms of written words, slogans are posted on various billboards or walls. As for the local tabloids, there are four types in total, and none of them publish any publicity materials on health.</p>
<p>(3) Current Status of Hospitals</p>
<p>There are four hospitals in Songjiang, namely Songjiang County Hospital, Ruose Hospital, Deqiong Hospital, and Rongcheng Hospital. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>(A) County Hospital: It is opened with a subsidy of 120 yuan per month from the county government. The president is appointed by the county government. Since its opening, it has been seventeen years, and several presidents have been replaced. The current president is Mr. Fan Jimin, who manages internal and external departments, has an affiliated obstetrics department, and also provides new-style smoking cessation services. There is one medical director, one physician, one assistant physician, and one midwife. In the past, there were nurses, but after Fan took office, due to financial difficulties, no nurses were hired. The hospital is simply equipped. There are a total of ten or so wards, one internal medicine room, one surgery room, one dispensing room, and two obstetrics rooms. The wards are divided into three classes. Although there are many wards, there are very few inpatients, but there are more people who want to quit smoking. All the equipment, medicines, and other items in it are brought by each president personally. Therefore, when a certain president comes, if there are very few personal supplies, then there will also be fewer equipment in the hospital during this period. This situation is really thought-provoking.</p>
<p>(B) Ruose Hospital: It was founded privately by Mr. Lu Bohong and entrusted to the Renai Association for management. It is entirely a church institution. The president is Mr. Lu himself. There is one medical director, two physicians, and several "white-headed mummies" who are responsible for examining patients, dispensing medicines, and managing wards. The equipment in this hospital is not complete. There are a dozen or so wards in the first, second, and third classes, and one large ward in the fourth class. Others are two serious illness wards and one disinfection room. The location is spacious and very quiet, and there is also a small garden. Because it has been open for a long time, the people of Songjiang know its name, so there are many patients. However, the "white-headed mummies" (Chinese) are not very capable of diagnosing diseases, so patients often transfer to other hospitals because they are ineffective. Its funding is raised by Mr. Lu, but there is no basic fund.</p>
<p>(C) Deqiong Hospital: It is a hospital established privately by Dr. Ke Deqiong. It has been open for seven years. The equipment inside seems to be slightly better than other hospitals. In addition to ordinary equipment, a new electrotherapy department has been added, using high-mountain sun lamps to treat various skin diseases, anemia, weakness, scrofula, bone tuberculosis, etc.; heat lamps to treat middle and external ear inflammation, mumps, and neurological diseases. The medicines in its self-established dispensing department are also more than in other hospitals. Some people even introduce patients to the hospital for dispensing when dispensing medicines in the pharmacy, which is another interesting thing. There are five wards in the hospital. There is also an affiliated maternity hospital, with one physician, two midwives, and two students, who also serve as nurses.</p>
<p>(D) Rongcheng Hospital: It was founded privately by Dr. Zhang Shaoxiu and just opened in November last year. The equipment is still good, with several wards, equipped with sun lamps, microscopes, etc. It also has an affiliated obstetrics department, with one physician, two midwives (who also serve as nurses), and one student, who serves as a nurse. The hospital is located next to the Shanghai-Songjiang Motor Road, quiet in the midst of noise, suitable for recuperation, so there are also many patients.</p>
<p>(4) Current Status of Private Clinics</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen new doctors in Songjiang. Although some of them call their clinics hospitals, I include them in this section because they do not meet the equipment requirements of a hospital, having neither wards nor nurses. This phenomenon is the same as what I saw when I was working in Zhenhai last summer.</p>
<p>The local people do not trust new doctors as much as they respect old doctors. In terms of the number of new doctors alone, they are not as numerous as old doctors. A group of patients are first treated by old doctors. If they are not effective, they turn to new doctors. For those with surgical diseases, they first apply plaster from Chinese medicine stores, or go to the old doctor's surgical department for diagnosis and treatment, but most of them fail to recover. They only turn to new doctors for treatment when the suppuration is very severe. The surgical and dermatology patients I saw in the hospital were all like this. Therefore, the treatment time is longer than that of the initial onset. In short, because the people's knowledge is simple, their understanding of new doctors is very shallow; even a group of intellectuals prefer to ask old doctors for diagnosis and treatment, how can the ignorant be blamed? In addition, there are very few new doctors in Songjiang, and there are no large hospitals with complete equipment, which cannot provide better services, which is also a major reason. Unless they are familiar to each doctor, there are few patients. Among them, several people serve as school doctors or medical officers in various agencies. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Sense Question and Answer on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(54) Beriberi (3)</p>
<p>Q: Are there any changes in the blood vessels of beriberi patients?</p>
<p>A: The tension of the peripheral blood vessels is mostly reduced, and vascular sounds can be heard.</p>
<p>Q: What is so-called cardiac beriberi?</p>
<p>A: This is a type of acute malignant beriberi, which occurs most often in young people. Some transition from mild or edematous types to cardiac beriberi; others have a sudden onset with chills, tremors, and high fever.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of cardiac beriberi?</p>
<p>A: When cardiac beriberi occurs, the patient experiences palpitations, chest tightness, epigastric distress, and shortness of breath, presenting a very unstable condition. They moan in bed, tossing and turning. They are extremely thirsty, or experience nausea, vomiting, and hiccups.</p>
<p>Q: What are the objective signs at this time?</p>
<p>A: Objectively, the cardiac dullness is enlarged, a systolic murmur appears, the second pulmonic sound is accentuated, and pulsations are seen in the heart and epigastric region. The pulse is rapid and weak, breathing is rapid, the amount of stool is reduced, the liver is enlarged, and blood pressure is low.</p>
<p>Q: Is cardiac beriberi very dangerous?</p>
<p>A: It is very dangerous. After about one or two days, the skin becomes dry and bluish, and death occurs due to cardiac paralysis.</p>
<p>Q: Is there any chance of treatment for cardiac beriberi?</p>
<p>A: If sufficient treatment is given early, death can be avoided.</p>
<p>Q: Do patients with beriberi always have edema?</p>
<p>A: Most beriberi patients have edema; but the degree varies. The edema initially appears in the lower legs, especially the medial and lateral malleoli, and the dorsum of the foot, tibial crest, etc. If the disease worsens, it gradually spreads to the entire lower limb, face, trunk, and upper limbs. In severe cases, edema forms in various cavities of the body.</p>
<p>Q: What is the reason for the formation of edema in beriberi?</p>
<p>A: Because the tissue cells and capillary endothelial cells change, causing water to accumulate in the tissues. In addition, edema may also be caused by changes in the heart or kidneys.</p>
<p>Q: What are the changes in the urine of beriberi patients?</p>
<p>A: The amount of urine is reduced; in severe cases, daily excretion is less than 100 cubic centimeters. There may even be urinary retention. When the condition improves, the amount of urine increases greatly. The urine contains protein, and casts are found.</p>
<p>Q: What are the changes in the kidneys?</p>
<p>A: When the disease is still mild, the kidney function is not greatly impaired. However, patients with moderate and severe beriberi have difficulty excreting water and salt. But the excretion of proteins and the like is still good.</p>
<h3>Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(38) Myopia (Continued)</p>
<p>The Pain of Myopia The pain of myopia is known to everyone. That is, distant images cannot be clearly seen. Therefore, when reading and writing, the eyeballs often have to be close to the book. When listening to lectures in the classroom, one often feels that the characters on the blackboard are blurred and difficult to distinguish. Whether in the theater or the cinema, you must choose to sit in the front rows to be satisfied. However, this kind of pain can be easily relieved by the assistance of corrective glasses. Prevention of Myopia When it comes to the prevention of myopia. It is to pay attention to the hygiene of the eyeballs. That is, to eliminate various factors that promote myopia. Now I will describe it in detail as follows. If you can implement them one by one. Even those who already have myopia. It should also be able to prevent its progress. (1) When reading and writing. The distance between the eye and the book. It is best to be thirty centimeters. It is best to take the light coming from the left. The head should not be flexed forward.</p>
<p>(2) It is not suitable for reading and writing under strong sunlight and the glare of snow and water.</p>
<p>(3) It is not suitable for reading and working at dusk. Or in dimly lit places. Because it easily fatigues the eyeballs.</p>
<p>(4) When working at night. If you use candles or kerosene lamps. It is often harmful to the eyes due to the shaking of the lights. Or changes in brightness.</p>
<p>(5) The characters in books. Should use clear and large fonts. Because prolonged reading of small fonts. It is easiest to induce myopia (many students become myopic due to prolonged use of small English dictionaries).</p>
<p>(6) When a certain distance between the eye and the object cannot be maintained. Like lying down, riding in a car, walking, etc. Do not read. Because the images are constantly moving. The distance is not fixed. So the eyeballs are most easily fatigued.</p>
<p>(7) Do not have the habit of looking at objects up close. Because it can cause the protrusion of the crystalline lens and the elongation of the eye axis. And lead to promoting myopia.</p>
<p>(8) After using eyesight for a long time. Be sure to give appropriate rest. So as to avoid eye congestion. And save eye labor.</p>
<p>(9) Alcohol can harm the optic nerve. Reduce vision. It is better to drink less. Lack of sleep. Can also hurt the eyes. Avoid it as much as possible.</p>
<p>(10) Movies with insufficient light or flickering violently. Do not watch. Correction of Myopia If you have become myopic. Of course, corrective methods must be used. The so-called correction method is nothing else. It is to wear appropriate concave lenses. To assist the refractive power of the crystalline lens. If so, the image refracted by the crystalline lens can be completely projected on the retina. At this time, the eyeball also becomes functional with a healthy emmetropic eye. You can see things clearly. However, before the configuration of this concave lens. Must be carefully examined by an ophthalmologist. The situation of each part in the eye. Fang is appropriate. Otherwise, if the concavity (that is, the depth) is not appropriate. Then the vision will be further damaged. You must be careful. At the same time, pay attention to the ten eye hygiene methods mentioned above. Do not think that you have glasses to assist. Abandon it and ignore it.</p>
<h3>"Health Guide" from Wuzhou Pharmacy</h3>
<p>— Yan Siru</p>
<p>In addition to clothing, food, housing and transportation, life cannot be without medical supplies. The world is enlightened, and materials are becoming more and more refined, especially for convenience; our country's medicine sticks to the old rules, lacks research, and the effects of taking medicine when sick are slow! Boiling and roasting are cumbersome! This is undeniable. As for the portability of travel and the storage of the family, it is even more lacking. The "Health Guide" published by Wuzhou Pharmacy is a compilation of various products of the pharmacy. The content is divided into categories, with detailed descriptions of the functions and methods of administration. Poor families in remote areas who cannot easily seek medical treatment can directly check the symptoms and purchase the appropriate medicine, so as not to be misled. When the book was about to print the fifth edition, Dr. Wang Yugang specially innovated it and printed the ingredients contained in each medicine in the book, so as to enhance the effect of guiding health and treating suffering, which is very good. Now, I will extract the preface written by Dr. Yu Yunxiu for the book as follows:</p>
<p>"Shanghai Wuzhou Pharmacy is the pioneer of new medicines in our country. It has worked hard to open up the wasteland for thirty-four years. In those days, the Chinese people had not heard of new medicines or seen them, let alone used them! If they saw little, they would be more surprised, and there would inevitably be those who pressed their swords at night; therefore, based on the products they配製, they explained them one by one, citing medical principles, clearly describing the symptoms, and then the use of medicines, which was all ready; as there were many products, the explanation became wider, and it was compiled into a book, titled Health Guide; it is indeed a collection of essential prescriptions for inns and a collection of saving lives. Medicine is changing every day, and this book is also changed from time to time, following the evolution of medicine and keeping pace with the times; now it has been entrusted to Wang Yugang, who has added, deleted, and changed it; Wang is my classmate, who has made progress in virtue and studies, with profound learning and fine thinking, and also my respected friend. The main points of his innovation of this book have already been described in his preface, to put it simply, it is to use science by taking advantage of the times. Alas! In the vast Divine Land, the country is becoming increasingly poor and the people are becoming increasingly impoverished. To deeply seek the reason, it is due to not knowing current affairs and despising science. Holding four thousand years of traditional knowledge, speaking highly of the past, being blindly arrogant, deeply closed and resistant, and rejecting the achievements of evolution, this is like being accustomed to the customs of eating raw meat and drinking blood, and not following the teachings of Shennong's hot food and the governance of the Yellow Emperor's clothing. Adorning the profound and playing with years, enjoying Zhuang Lao's theory of剖斗折衡, criticizing Confucianism, 法 listening to words and holding things accountable, this is why the people's feelings are deteriorating and things are not successful. Can it be said that 校眞can whip strong armor and sharp weapons, and鑿隧抱甕are enough to傲梏橰? Retreating to the countryside, comparing oneself to the natives of Africa and the Taiwanese生蕃, how can the country not be weakened and destroyed! The transformation of customs and habits is led by medicine. Our 神州華冑, in the time of炎黃, civilization began, and there was the beginning of medicine, which is one proof; therefore, I say that the evolution of medicine can be a sign of the rise and fall of the country and the civilization and savagery of the people, which can be verified in the past and in the present, and is more accurate than turtle shells and符瑞. The people of our country have been talking about using science to save the country for many years, but they have not seen anything in medicine! I am always worried about this, so I regard the absurd theories of old doctors as floods of Yu and fierce beasts of Yi, and try my best to eliminate them to enlighten the people of the country; thinking that if they cannot wake up to this, they will not have the wisdom to take advantage of the times and the courage to use science, and the nation will eventually fall into ruin! Now, the National Medical Museum has organized the old studies with science as the method; after thinking back, our炎黄子孫 may be spared from being slaves who are whipped; and the book of Wuzhou is also taking a further step at this time to advocate new social ears and eyes; then the innovation of this book is not only beneficial to the public's health as a guide! It also plays a powerful role in transforming the times, and can be said to be able to fulfill its pioneering responsibility. After the book was completed, Mr. Xiang Shengwu, the general manager of Wuzhou, asked me to write a preface, and I quickly wrote my feelings to return it."</p>
<p>(Reporter's note: The book has now been published and widely distributed to all walks of life. If you enclose a one-cent stamp, send it to the promotion department of the company at Fourth Malu, and they will send back a copy immediately.)</p>
<h3>Medical Pain Relief (6)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>There is also a type of ulcer that is inextricably linked to stomach ulcers, namely, ulcers in the part of the duodenum connected to the lower end of the stomach, called duodenal ulcers. The causes and symptoms are similar to those of stomach ulcers, but the difference is that duodenal ulcers cause pain when the stomach is empty, and the pain persists until the next meal. The pain subsides only for an hour or two after eating, and then it returns after the food is digested. Patients experience increased pain when they eat irritating foods and reduced pain when they eat bland foods. It is common to see patients with this condition suffer from prolonged pain for ten or twenty years without relief.</p>
<p>Since this disease is so common and so persistent, I believe that pain relief methods for this condition are worthy of our research. Now, let's first talk about improper methods of pain relief. Ordinary pain relievers in pill or powder form are useless. Those with weak willpower are easily enslaved by opium addiction. For example, a person with stomach pain meets a friend who smokes opium, and the friend invites him to take a puff. After taking it once, his stomach pain immediately stops. After one, two, or many times, opium becomes an addiction. Once he stops smoking opium, the stomach pain recurs. Over time, this person becomes completely enslaved to opium. Now, let's briefly discuss how opium and morphine can relieve this pain. We know that stomach ulcer pain is caused by the ulcer being stimulated by acid or coarse food in the stomach. The nerve receptors at the site of the ulcer transmit the stimulation to the pain center in the brain, and the person feels stomach pain. What is the effect of eating opium or getting a morphine injection? Opium and morphine are both narcotics. Their effect is that opium is inhaled into the lungs and then absorbed into the blood, and from the blood, it reaches the pain center in the brain. The pain center nerve cells are anesthetized and lose consciousness. Although the sensation of stomach pain is still transmitted to the brain, the brain has become numb. Thus, the pain disappears. In reality, the stomach pain is not stopped, nor is the stomach ulcer healed. Moreover, due to the anesthetic effect, the patient eats irritating and coarse foods, causing more damage to the stomach ulcer. The ulcer becomes larger and larger, and the patient is unaware of it. If there were no anesthetic effect, unsuitable foods would worsen the stomach pain, and the patient would not be able to eat them, so the ulcer would not gradually enlarge. From this, we can see that using opium to relieve stomach pain is not the proper method. I sincerely advise friends with stomach problems not to fall for narcotics.</p>
<p>Someone asks, what is the proper way to relieve stomach pain? Using scientific medical methods to relieve stomach pain is the proper method. Here is an outline of new pain relief methods: First, it is necessary to remove the cause of stomach ulcers. Second, reduce physical and mental labor so that the stomach can rest partially. Third, a suitable diet. A suitable diet is: (1) food that does not irritate the stomach when it enters; (2) food that can reduce stomach acid; (3) food that does not cause the stomach to produce too much digestive juice; (4) adequate nutrition to increase the patient's resistance so that the stomach ulcer can heal.</p>
<p>Foods that do not irritate the stomach and reduce stomach acid include milk, cream, soy milk, egg whites, lotus root starch soup, noodle soup, rice water, and well-cooked thin porridge. These foods do not irritate the stomach when they enter, so the stomach does not produce much stomach acid. When there is a lot of stomach acid, the stomach pain is worsened, and when there is less stomach acid, the stomach pain is reduced. For severe stomach pain, the initial diet should be limited to the above foods or similar foods. After several weeks, the types of food can be gradually increased, including bread, well-cooked vegetable hearts, vegetable leaves, etc. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Viscosity</h3>
<p>— Hu Luo</p>
<p>Mr. Wang wrote this in "Melancholy": "They understand the direction in which the world is turning, and they also see the dangers that lie ahead of them... However, the bad characteristics of their bodies and the bad atmosphere in which they live limit them. He does not have the courage and perseverance to take a step forward." Therefore, they are "melancholy." Yes, this is the inevitable product of this changing society.</p>
<p>It is precisely because they live suspended in society that they develop this habit of hesitation and looking forward and backward. Seeing that society is rolling forward, and knowing that the tides of this era will mercilessly wash away; however, they lack courage, they are nostalgic for the old nest, and they also have strange dreams, dreaming of watching on the shore as the river rolls past. However, reality is different from dreams, and they also feel that it is impossible to watch from the sidelines, so they are even more "melancholy" and decadent.</p>
<p>This explains the "viscosity" effect. A fly is stuck on the glue on the paper and cannot escape. The function of the glue is to stick the fly tightly to the paper. In today's society, people who live in suspension are also like this. Old ideas, habits... are like glue, sticking them tightly. When they realize that glue is hateful, the glue still sticks to them. On the one hand, he wants to break away from this glued paper, but on the other hand, the power of the glue makes him nostalgic for the old paper. Because of this "contradiction", they are "melancholy" and in pain.</p>
<p>But people can never be compared with flies. Because after a fly is glued, it only dies. When people feel the crisis, they constantly think of getting rid of the crisis. However, in this world, people are like "sailing against the current", if they don't advance, they only retreat. It seems impossible for people to hang in society forever. If you don't get up and chase, you will be destroyed by the tides of the times. Therefore, the people in the middle can only work hard to get rid of this viscous thing and chase forward!</p>
<p>It is not impossible to get rid of "viscosity" and "melancholy". However, if you want to get rid of this viscous thing by standing on the sidelines, you will not only fail to get rid of it, but you will be afraid that the more you get rid of it, the more "melancholy" you will be. Getting rid of viscosity is by no means possible by just singing in your mouth, but should be achieved in the furnace of life. If you don't participate in life yourself, and dream of getting rid of "melancholy", I'm afraid this can only be realized in dreams. However, beautiful dreams are shattered when they touch reality.</p>
<p>"Viscosity" can only be dried by the flames of life, otherwise, the viscous thing will still stick to you tightly, and you can only continue to be "melancholy" until the day of destruction.</p>
<h3>They Got Through Another Day Like This</h3>
<p>— Yier</p>
<p>Ruo has become increasingly impoverished since losing his job! He has asked people everywhere to find work for him, but he still hasn't even found a clue. He has pawned all the valuable objects he had, and they have long been put into the pawnshop. He has also bought enough on credit, and shops are no longer willing to sell you anything without cash. Borrow? Where can he ask for help in a foreign land? He has no relatives. Of the two or three friends he can count as confidants, some have been burdened by him too much, so he is embarrassed to ask again? Some have returned to their hometown and are no longer in Shanghai. What about the others? They are just as poor as he is, and they can't even take care of themselves, so how can they have the surplus power to save others? Therefore, although the two of them have been frugal and hardworking, enduring hunger and cold for several months, they are inevitably trapped in a desperate situation and overwhelmed by life!</p>
<p>Today, he saw that they couldn't even afford lunch. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, Ruo suddenly jumped up from his desk, took off his only old suit, wrapped it in a newspaper, put on a cloth robe, and quickly opened the door and went downstairs, carrying the newspaper package. He didn't say a word as he left. Ying, who was lying on the bed, asked him "Where are you going?" He didn't seem to hear, and just left.</p>
<p>Walking into a nearby pawnshop, Ruo handed the newspaper package he was carrying through the iron gate window of the high counter, and stood outside, raising his head, quietly waiting for news from inside.</p>
<p>"We don't accept suits", the scattered newspaper package was pushed out.</p>
<p>He ran into the second one.</p>
<p>The pawnshop clerk opened it and took a look: "No! It's too old!"</p>
<p>At this time, Ruo was a little flustered, but not desperate. He went straight to the one that sold goods.</p>
<p>The newspaper package was sent up as usual.</p>
<p>"You even bring this kind of thing?" The clerk didn't even look at it and pushed the newspaper package out with force.</p>
<p>"One dollar is fine, please help me, I'll redeem it in two or three days!" He said pleadingly.</p>
<p>"Redeem? Who wants you to redeem it? Take it out! Go, go!" The clerk smiled smugly.</p>
<p>Ruo knew that there was no way to negotiate any further, so he re-wrapped the newspaper package, tucked it under his arm, lowered his head, and walked out of the gate. At this time, several poorly dressed workers standing outside the iron shed all cast a glance at him—a look of sympathy.</p>
<p>On the way home, he couldn't help feeling a burst of sadness in his heart, and he said to himself: "A poor man can't do it!" He thought again: "The pawnshop clerk's attitude is really arrogant! This suit is indeed too old, and no one wants it. But isn't it worth even one dollar? Even if you don't accept it, there's no need to be so aggressive!" While he was thinking wildly, a small beggar suddenly followed him from behind, repeatedly begging him, stretching out his hand for money. He glanced at the child and felt very pitiful, so he simply threw the six copper coins he had in his pocket to him. Without looking back, he turned another corner and strode away.</p>
<h3>Enslaved by Objects</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>The Sound of the Watchman's Clapper</h3>
<p>— Xinren</p>
<p>In the past, when I lived in a bustling downtown area, in a state of noise and commotion, both physically and mentally exhausted, I didn't even know that there were watchmen patrolling in Tokyo. This time, I moved my home, and the place seems like a small town in the countryside; every midnight, there is a familiar sound of the watchman's clapper, from far to near, from near to far, breaking through the deathly silence. People are unwilling to be lonely, just like moths are unwilling to be in the dark. In the dark night when everything in the world seems to be dead, in the snowy night when the melting water drips monotonously, this sound of the watchman's clapper, this sound of the watchman's clapper is full of indomitable will, full of experienced emotions, solemnly, steadily, approaching me. At this time, like the believers who are said to have come to worship the holy land of Jerusalem, I held my breath, letting my whole soul fluctuate in excitement and joy: the sound of the watchman's clapper stirred up the turbulent waves of thought in my mind, and after a while, it faintly disappeared.</p>
<p>The sound of the watchman's clapper in my hometown is a clumsy drum sound, which does not leave me with a trace of intimacy; what is worth reminiscing about is the sound of the watchman's clapper in the old capital. Although the sound of the watchman's clapper in the old capital is old and rigid, and does not have the firm brightness with the vigor of youth that I hear now, they both have firm will and solemn emotions. At that time, I, Guang, and Jia were living in a remote courtyard, and the northern-specific north wind was blowing, making the thin paper of the window screen peculiar to the old capital tremble. The cold air that emerged from the damp ground permeated the hungry skin of people through the straw mat on the broken cloth bed in bursts. In the constant trembling, the familiar sound of the watchman's clapper came, resolutely and steadily. Only at this moment, I forgot the cold, suppressed the trembling, and let my throbbing heart follow behind the sound of the watchman's clapper. Except for the joy and excitement of the prisoners in hell when they hear human voices, there is nothing else to describe my mood at that time.</p>
<p>The changes in the world are rapid. Since I left my mother's womb against my own strength and occupied a seat in the world, in the past twenty-one years, the changes I have seen are countless. Many people have changed from being慷慨激昂to being corrupt and degenerate, and many people are trapped in cruel darkness like Guang now, or are struggling on the road of life surrounded by poverty like Jia. The people who have heard the same sound of the watchman's clapper have undergone such changes in an instant! Only this steady sound of the watchman's clapper is still ringing in the darkness, ringing.</p>
<p>As long as they are people who hate the dark, they generally like the sound of the watchman's clapper; this sound implies warmth to us in the dark night, and when we have finished listening to the last sound of the watchman's clapper, the fresh and warm sunlight will affectionately caress our haggard faces.</p>
<h3>Living Characters and Dead Characters (2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>In the present time, when we have not yet restored the old ways nor completely changed to the new, we must "follow the majority" for the sake of popular understanding. Now there are students A, B, and C, all working on the same topic. In student A's writing, there is the phrase "he tài fifteen years old." In student B's writing, there is "he cái fifteen years old," and in student C's writing, there is the sentence "he cái fifteen years old." The characters "cái", "cái", and "cái" can all be used interchangeably with the character "cái". In the Han Dynasty books, "cái" and "cái" were both used to mean "initial" or "just", so originally none of them were incorrect. However, I would choose student C. This is simply because the character "cái" used by student C is commonly used in society today as "cái," it is a "living character," while "cái" and "cái" have both become "dead characters." Of course, "cái" and "cái" are "living characters" in the contexts of "getting rich" and "tailoring."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the character "shēn" was originally the ancient form of the character "diàn" (electricity), the character "zì" was originally the ancient form of the character "bí" (nose), the character "péng" was originally the ancient form of the character "fèng" (phoenix), the character "mǔ" was originally the ancient form of the character "guàn" (pierce), the character "qī" was originally the ancient form of the character "huà" (transform), and the character "xī" was originally the ancient form of the character "qī" (perch). It would seem that "shēn," "zì," "péng," "mǔ," "qī," and "xī" have simpler strokes than the later-developed characters such as "diàn" and "bí," so we could replace "diàn" with "shēn" and "bí" with "zì," and "fèng" with "péng." However, in common usage, "send a telegram" can definitely not be written as "send a shēn report"! (The Shēnbao newspaper would laugh in misunderstanding!) "His nose is red" can definitely not be written as "His zì is red"! "Dragons and phoenixes playing" also cannot be written as "Dragons and péng playing"! Why is that? "Shēn" is a dead character for "diàn," "zì" is a dead character for "bí," and "péng" is a dead character for "fèng"! Similarly, the character "qián" (front) should originally be written as "qián," according to the Shuōwén, "qián" means "to advance without going." "Qián" was originally the character for "scissors" and had no meaning of advancing, but because the character "qián" is commonly used and the character "qián" is no longer used, "qián" has become a dead character.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao once laughed at me, saying, "Fēn qí laughs at fēn qí, Uncle Shū is terribly angry." (This is a common ditty we sang at school.) Those who write "fēn qí," "qí" is a living character; those who write "fēn qí," "qí" is a dead character—there is a distinction between living and dead characters. At the time, I replied to his ditty with two lines: "Be careful lest 'mēng' be mistaken for Cao, Who knows 'chén' and 'zhèn' originally the same character," because the "zhèn" (formation) in "lín zhèn" (facing the formation) is now commonly written as "zhèn," no longer written as "lín chén" as in ancient paintings.</p>
<p>I wonder, how many people who write wrong characters now are like Mr. Cao, able to know why they are different? Not knowing why they are different is a mistake, not a difference. Teachers pass on the mistakes, and students spread the errors, inevitably misleading future students. (Teaching wrong characters is misleading a person's studies; teaching variant characters is also wasting a person's time.)</p>

<h3>War Miscellany (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tokunaga Nao, Translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>Every day, my mother would go to collect "leftover rice." My petite aunt would spread a mat under the eaves and do the side job of sharpening chopsticks. After school, my sister and I would also help with the sharpening. I absolutely hated this "sharpening chopsticks" job. Carefully sharpening those very thin bamboo strips with a small knife was simply suffocating. I would just play with the toy that was always in my arms, and I would run out as soon as I had the chance.</p>
<p>Our games, with the war being the most popular, were quite violent. On moonlit nights, many children would decide in advance to use the Land God Temple at the end of the village as the center and rob each other's "positions."</p>
<p>I was very strong, but I lacked agility, so I would often get bumps on my head and run home.</p>
<p>At that time, toys with war scenes and portraits of generals and lieutenant generals were very popular. It was also at that time that I memorized the portraits and names of General Kuroki and Navy Lieutenant Generals Oyama, Nozu, Nogi, and Uriu.</p>
<p>The hawkers selling extras would often run by in a frantic ringing of bells. As soon as they heard the ringing, my aunt and mother, although they couldn't understand the extras themselves, would be distracted and flustered, and buy them. I often ran after the hawkers selling extras barefoot.</p>
<p>"Won, won, captured Jiuliancheng."</p>
<p>I think it was a long time before the fall of Mukden, when Jiuliancheng was captured, the villagers were overjoyed. When we won in "capturing positions," we would also shout "Won, won, captured Jiuliancheng," and clap and dance.</p>
<p>At the top of the big camphor tree in the Land God Temple in the village, a huge national flag was raised. The "tree-climbing Ah Shen brother" in the village made the greatest determination and climbed to the dangerous top to hang up the big flag. It seemed that it was hung up in order to pray—to bless the victory of the war and the safe triumphant return of the soldiers from the village!"</p>
<p>But, reports of deaths in battle came one after another.</p>
<p>"Ah Zhen has died in battle!"</p>
<p>One evening, my grandfather held a telegram with red stripes and ran crying from my house's signature side.</p>
<p>My mother and the others, who had not been so trembling when they heard the reports of people other than relatives dying in battle, had been apprehensive all the time, as if a crack had suddenly opened under their feet since Zhenzhu died in battle.</p>
<p>Although Zhenzhu died, no funeral was held. Not even a hair was sent back, so there was no way to hold a funeral. In the home of the grandfather, whose son had already died young and only a glimmer of hope remained, the grandson had died in battle, it seemed lonely.</p>
<p>I hated the Russian devils very much.</p>
<p>There was also a report of the death in battle of Miichi, the eldest son of the landlord. Military letters from my father were sent from time to time, but there was suddenly no news from my uncle.</p>
<p>Every night, my mother and aunt would chant Buddhist scriptures and pray for the fate of my aunt and uncle and their whole lives. Sometimes, after I went to bed, my mother and the others would beat the Taiping drum like crazy people and chant in a loud voice: "Namu Myōhō Renge-kyō, Namu Myōhō Renge-kyō." They would chant until very late, so that I seemed to be able to hear it in my dreams.</p>
<p>I couldn't help being a little afraid of the war. I couldn't help feeling a desire to meet my father.</p>
<p>Mukden was captured.</p>
<p>I can't remember what month or day it was, I only remember: that day I hurried to buy a newspaper from the hawkers selling extras, it was a hot summer day; it was the most intense moment of sunlight, when the sun was shining so hard that the sand on the road seemed to be burning the soles of our feet (we children mostly went barefoot every day).</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About Reading Ancient Books</h3>
<p>— Bāshān</p>
<p>Recently, some people have been advocating reading ancient books. I am ashamed to say that I, with my dull natural gifts, tremble as soon as I hear it. Based on past experience, advocating reading ancient books is fine to talk about, but if you really want to read them, I am afraid that even the people who are advocating it will have a headache. Qin Shi Huang burned books, but only burned some "reactionary" books, there were still "positive" books existing. After Xiang Yu set a fire and burned the ancient books completely, Fu Sheng dictated the classics in the Han Dynasty. Whether or not they were authentic, untouched goods, that is not something we should be concerned with, but the fact that there were not many ancient books left is a historical fact that no one can deny, right? The people of the Han Dynasty wrote the most fake ancient books. Apart from those that are now known to be fake, who knows how many fake ancient books are still deceiving later generations? This is also something that no one can deny, right? Even the recently written books by the people of the Han Dynasty, due to errors in copying and transmission, have left behind articles that are difficult to read and understand. Who knows how many there still are, this is also something that no one can deny, right? In the Han Dynasty, the Gongyang Guliang school and the Zuozhuan school's struggle between the New Text and Old Text schools has still not been resolved, and the two sides continue to argue about their respective merits based on their "teachings," making it difficult for later generations to know how to follow them. This is probably something that no one can deny, right?</p>
<p>It is difficult enough to distinguish between what is genuine and what is fake, but reading books is also not easy. People in the past read books by first mastering elementary learning. What is elementary learning? It is the way to recognize characters, distinguish sounds, and explain words. To recognize characters, you must study the "Shuōwén"; to distinguish sounds, you must study phonology; to explain words, you must first read the "Erya." These three tasks of recognizing characters, distinguishing sounds, and explaining words alone are already half a lifetime of scholarship. What's more, there is also the study of bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions?</p>
<p>Studying ancient books and passing on ancient culture is the work of excavating heritage. Specialized scholars tirelessly strive and devote their lives to it, which is something that the country should reward. However, if you want students to all delve into old piles of paper, that is a big problem. First, there must be teachers who can teach well and teach clearly; second, the few years that students spend in school pass by in the blink of an eye, and time does not allow it.</p>
<p>How many teachers are there now who can teach ancient books well and teach them clearly? How can students continue to read them?</p>
<h3>Cui Hu</h3>
<p>— Xin Lü</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era, on the fourteenth day of the third month.</p>
<p>That day was the Qingming Festival. The poetry society, to appreciate the fine festival, specially held a grand banquet at Wen Fei Qing's house. Many people came, and after some drinking, everyone started chatting freely. Li Shangyin, who was sitting next to him, was a notorious prankster. He suddenly narrowed his eyes and patted Cui Hu's shoulder:</p>
<p>"Ah, old Cui, you are already a full thirty years old this year; you should quickly marry a sister-in-law. Don't miss the spring!"</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? Why doesn't Mr. Cui ever invite us to drink wedding wine?" Another person said:</p>
<p>"Ha!"</p>
<p>"Ha!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Cui Hu felt extremely embarrassed: his face was burning, and he thought that Lao Li shouldn't intentionally mock him in public. He became angry and didn't drink any more wine. With a livid face, he stood up and walked out. Despite many</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>people calling him, he claimed to have a headache and stubbornly refused to go back in.</p>
<p>He walked out, tipsy, and seeing that the weather was so good, he didn't want to go straight home, so he followed his feet towards Mount Luojia. Along the way, the gentle breeze caressed his face, and butterflies flew back and forth. The willow branches greeted him with smiles, and his spirits were instantly lifted.</p>
<p>Mount Luojia was not far from the east of the city, and the main road led directly to it. That day, he absentmindedly took a few turns but got lost;</p>
<p>Seeing that dusk was approaching and crows were flying around, he still couldn't see the shadow of Mount Luojia, and his feet were tired and sore. He couldn't help but become anxious, thinking: "Today, if I don't ask for directions, I'm afraid I'll get completely lost!" He crossed a stone bridge and saw a small village in the distance amidst the red peach blossoms. He walked towards it. There were only two or three village houses, but the open space outside for drying rice was very wide. A few chickens and ducks were pecking at the remaining rice husks. Smoke was rising from the chimneys, adorning the vast expanse of dusk. Looking around, there was no one in sight. He gently knocked on the door of the village house nearest to his left. The door opened with a creak, and a charming village girl came out.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry! I'm lost. Could you tell me how to get to Mount Luojia?"</p>
<p>"Go north from here and cross Xianglian Creek, and you'll be there. Ah, sir, but it's already getting late. You probably won't make it there in time."</p>
<p>"Oh!..." Facing this simple and beautiful village girl, and hearing her soft words like pearls rolling off a plate, Cui Hu had a flight of fancy.</p>
<p>"Sir! I think you must be very tired from your journey. If you don't mind the dirt, please come in and rest for a while. My father really likes scholars."</p>
<p>"Thank you, miss! It's getting late, and I should go back. If you could give me a cup of clear spring water to quench my thirst, I would be very grateful!"</p>
<p>As he was drinking the water, the village girl leaned against the door, neither leaving nor approaching, just smiling at him. Two dimples floated on her face, like a pair of crabapple sepals.</p>
<p>"Heavens, what a beautiful girl!" He couldn't help but feel restless and wanted to stay a little longer to feast his eyes on her beauty. But finally, the water was finished, and he had no choice but to return the empty cup to her:</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>The door slammed shut. He trudged back, as if he had lost his soul. From that day on, because he missed the village girl so much, he became listless and ill! However, he was too embarrassed to say it out loud, and so he lingered in bed, almost for a whole year. Last month, he slowly recovered. Today, it was Qingming again, and he changed into a light and cool goose feather coat, eagerly rushing to the old place, hoping to see his unforgettable sweetheart again.</p>
<p>With a feeling like Jin Lü returning to his hometown, he entered the small village. The peach blossoms were still blooming brightly, and the chickens and ducks were still quietly wandering around, but the door to her house was tightly bolted.</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah!", this was truly saddening to him, where had her family gone? Had they moved to another place? Were they visiting relatives and not home? ... The flower of hope had withered! The dream of passion was shattered! All that remained were the heartbreaking two or three empty houses and the irritating, melancholy clouds.</p>
<p>The willow branches swayed gently, and the peach blossoms smiled.</p>
<p>After asking the neighbors in detail, but still getting no clear answer, he slowly borrowed a brush from someone, dipped it in dark ink, and wrote these four lines on her door:</p>
<p>"Last year on this day, within this door,</p>
<p>Her face and the peach blossoms reflected each other, red.</p>
<p>But where has that face gone now?</p>
<p>The peach blossoms still smile in the spring breeze!"</p>
<h3>Reflections After Seeing "The Paint Is Not Dry"</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Although the play "The Paint Is Not Dry" is performed as a comedy, in essence, it has a tragedy at its core. The play is divided into three acts. The first act tells the story of a poor painter who used to live in Doctor Hatch's house. Ten years after his death, his paintings suddenly became valuable. Then, a art dealer came along, used flowery words to swindle away two paintings; the second act shows contemporary famous critics, collectors, and booksellers flocking to Hatch's house, each willing to pay a huge sum to buy the poor painter's paintings, but the paintings that were left were burned by his wife. Only the most valuable portrait of the maid, Guan Ni, remained. So, the doctor used all his cunning to snatch it from the maid, hoping to sell it and make a fortune; in the third act, the maid inadvertently said as she was leaving that she still had seventeen paintings that his wife had told her to burn. The doctor was almost ecstatic when he heard this, and his whole family cheered and shouted. But then Guan Ni revealed that she had been engaged to the poor painter before his death, and took out a ring as proof. The inheritance belonged to the wife. Like a bolt from the blue, the doctor's golden dream was shattered. Guan Ni left with all the paintings, and the doctor's family cried bitterly.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the plot of this play is a surreal, idealistic work, and does not include much reality. As for what the director, Ouyang Yuqian, said, that this play has considerable significance for current society, and that it directly satirizes people like Hatch and indirectly satirizes the system that supports such people, I don't quite agree. In this era of intense struggle between capitalist and socialist societies, it is not enough to use such a vague and conscious script to express anything. Therefore, to say that it satirizes the current social system is really a far-fetched exaggeration. As for satirizing figures like Doctor Hatch, that is possible, because many of the petty bourgeoisie who remain in this rapidly changing era feel the sadness of decline, and this fate of decline is irreversible, but at the same time, they struggle, and thoughts of a grey area fill their minds. Doctor Hatch is a typical representative of this, clearly demonstrated in his family life. The more he tries to maintain the facade of a gentleman, the more he reveals a pathetic appearance. Others, such as the so-called critics who hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat, and are actually vulgar, and the hypocritical and treacherous merchants, these clownish figures are indeed abundant in current society. In the play, each of them is exposed and relentlessly dissected. So, to say that attacking people like Hatch can evoke sympathy.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Because it is a comedy, every scene is shrouded in a thick and interesting atmosphere, full of humor and wit, making people unable to help but smile. The connection of the entire plot is very tight, and the development of the story is very coordinated. It goes from light to intense, and as it reaches its height, the emotions become more and more tense. So, the audience almost entirely continues to the end of the play with a joyful, unceasing feeling of unconstrained laughter. However, after watching it, I had an opposite feeling, feeling that the expression of Hatch's thoughts and actions made one think of an elderly person belonging to a declining class, whose weakness, incompetence, and pitifulness were both laughable and disgusting.</p>
<p>The control of the characters is quite coordinated, but there is one shortcoming that cannot be ignored, which is that this play should have used the maid Guan Ni as the central thread of the story, but in the end, it turned into focusing on the doctor, and Guan Ni's life, background, and personality became blurred.</p>
<p>The actors all worked hard. Shu Yan, who played the doctor, did a very seasoned job, only a little worse when he first appeared in the first act, but generally, he was satisfactory. Li Lilian, who played the wife, had very real and moving facial expressions, but occasionally, some places were too exaggerated. In particular, she expressed the unique temperament of a middle-class family woman more deeply. Wang Ying, who played the maid, was also good, but her attitude when speaking was slightly over the top, and she wore a pair of fashionable high heels when she appeared, walking with a graceful charm, which was not appropriate. This should be attributed to the negligence of the supervisor. There is nothing much to say about the other actors, Lu Lu was the worst. Her acting experience is not enough.</p>
<h3>The People Who Collect Coal Cinders</h3>
<p>— Qing Feng</p>
<p>The foundation of our lives is built on the indifference of others: from the abandoned ashes they discard, we seek the resources of fire.</p>
<p>We have no home. The giant hand of life has driven us from the countryside to the city; just like the changing climate drives the swallows.</p>
<p>Sucked dry of blood by machines, thrown out of factories, like a meatless bone, no one pities us. Among us are such helpless old people; natural disasters and man-made calamities ate their parents, no one to raise them, no one to teach them, leaving them to the erosion of wind, frost, rain, and dew. Among us are such wandering children. Our numbers are enormous.</p>
<p>The coal cinder heap is our happy paradise.</p>
<p>From spring to summer, from autumn to winter, we dig without a day off. Using such a small and narrow iron sheet, we dig into the hardened coal cinders, carefully searching for hard stones, loose mud, and multi-faceted broken bricks. Nothing can be mixed in with what we are looking for. By the starlight above, we can identify particles even smaller than soybeans.</p>
<p>Coal ash crawls from our hands to our noses. It blackens our faces, and it also blackens our lives. Yet we have never washed it off, because it cannot be cleaned with ordinary water.</p>
<p>We pick non-stop every day, and we can exchange it for sixty or seventy copper coins. This number is too small. But what can we do? When the price of labor is not the same? We can only seek our own food from the discarded remnants of others' indifference. We do not seek the pity of others, we know that is impossible, just like dreaming of a pound of coal falling out of a train's chimney. We do not sigh ourselves either, because that would delay the time for proper digging.</p>
<p>We are, like what we seek, ignored. Sometimes we cannot avoid suffering a contempt that is almost insulting. Continuing now, we have flowed here, the railroad slowly crawling in front, we following behind it. Look, those millions upon millions of moving crowds, those are our companions. Pile after pile of coal cinders, under the claws of this wriggling but enormous monster, is gradually diminishing. As long as we know that there lies the resources of our lives, even if it is a real mountain range, we can dig it over. Though at present, it is still:</p>
<p>The foundation of our lives is built on the indifference of others: from the abandoned ashes, we seek the light source of fire.</p>

<p>"Duke Zheng Invades Chen"</p>
<p>In the world, success comes from fear, and failure comes from negligence. Fear is the source of good fortune, and negligence is the door to disaster. Marquis Chen feared the strength of Song and Wei, but neglected the weakness of Zheng, and then thought that Zheng could do nothing, and did not allow its success. When the calamities of war did not arise from the feared Song and Wei, but from the neglected Zheng, then is negligence not the door to disaster? Then the saying "How could Zheng do anything?" is the root of national defeat and family ruin. The ancients said that one word could lead to the loss of a country. Qin weakened the people but prepared for the Xiongnu, was it not because they feared the strength of the Xiongnu, and thought that the people could do nothing? But those who destroyed Qin were not the Xiongnu. Emperor Wu of Jin thought that the Rong and Di could do nothing, and did not move them, so in the end he was destroyed by the Rong and Di. Emperor Yang of Sui thought that bandits could do nothing and did not take precautions, so in the end he was destroyed by bandits. So how could the saying "What can they do?" not be strongly criticized.</p>

<h3>He Should Have Died But Didn't: Gene Harlow Died Three Times in a Row</h3>
<p>— 缇云</p>
<p>1934 was a difficult year for Gene Harlow, but she managed to get through it safely. She had encountered many difficulties before, but none as terrible as last year. For at least half of the year, Gene Harlow was practically a condemned prisoner awaiting execution at noon. Now that 1935 has arrived and several months have passed, she finally feels that the danger has passed and dares to talk about it.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1934, she received a letter from an astrologer warning her in advance that she would die in a car accident before the end of 1934. The letter was sent by the post office. The astrologer sent it on his own initiative; Gene had not consulted him.</p>
<p>Have any of you readers ever heard a fortune teller say that you would die this year? If you have had such an experience, you will surely forgive a young woman like Gene Harlow. You can put yourself in her shoes and imagine it. One morning, you are drinking coffee when your servant brings in a large stack of letters. You open them one by one. Suddenly, one of them, when opened, contains a long letter with astrological charts and notes saying, "According to the stars, you will die in a car accident this year."</p>
<p>After reading this, how could you not read on carefully? Furthermore, astrologers, whether Chinese or foreign, use terminology about the five elements and their interactions that is not easily understood by ordinary people. This only adds to the letter's mystique. The letter also included many examples of predictions he had made in the past that had come true. Finally, he said that in addition to Gene, three other movie stars were in great danger due to similar astrological disturbances.</p>
<p>Gene Harlow originally wanted to dismiss it with a laugh, although that was not an easy thing to do. However, for almost half a year, she gradually put the matter out of her mind, until one day, a movie star died in an accident. That star happened to be one of the people mentioned in the anonymous astrologer's letter. Wouldn't that mean that Gene's death was predicted and could not be changed? Her anxiety can be imagined. You may not believe it, but potential energy is possible.</p>
<p>"There are so many things in the world that humans cannot understand, or can only understand a part of," Gene Harlow said. "How can I say that the astrologer's predictions are unreliable? So I can neither believe nor disbelieve." But for the sake of safety, and to respect her mother's wishes, she has since stopped driving alone, even though she loves to drive herself. Her chauffeur was also sternly warned by her mother not to exceed 35 miles per hour. Long car trips were even more strongly avoided by Gene.</p>
<p>But Gene actually died, according to outside reports and rumors – and died many times! I don't know where these reports came from, but every time rumors spread, Gene's family would receive phone calls from newspapers offering condolences and inquiring about details, keeping them busy. The first time, a morning newspaper suddenly called Gene's house at one-thirty in the morning, first offering condolences and then inquiring about details. Gene's mother, knowing that her daughter was sleeping soundly in bed at home, told them that nothing of the sort had happened. But they didn't believe it. Gene's mother had no choice but to wake Gene up from bed and let her talk to them, and that finally resolved the matter.</p>
<p>The second time, also in the middle of the night, Gene was also sleeping at home. Strangely, both times they said it was a car accident. The third time, the situation was even more serious. Several newspapers in Los Angeles simultaneously published news of Gene Harlow's untimely death, using large headlines to say that Gene Harlow had died in a car accident on her way back from watching a football game somewhere. Gene's death had caused a great commotion outside, but she herself knew nothing about it. That evening, a friend invited her to dinner. She went straight from the studio to her friend's house. Everyone there was talking about Gene's death, sighing and lamenting. When Gene walked in, everyone fell silent. Gene felt strange, but what was especially strange was that when her friend saw the guest, she hurried forward to shake hands, and when she saw that it was Gene Harlow, she cried out in shock.</p>
<p>When the hostess came to, she said that she thought Gene's ghost had appeared. Gene is now bringing up old memories, which makes her feel speechless, but in 1934, she couldn't laugh.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Fang Yunying"—Jin Cheng</h3>
<p>—凌鹤</p>
<p>As "Fang Yunying" is screened, the impression of Tian Han's "Death of a Famous Actor" constantly surfaces in my mind. Although the screen does not explicitly state that it is an adaptation of "Death of a Famous Actor," it is, in fact, derived from it. However, some plots not found in "Death of a Famous Actor" are added later, and the "art for art's sake" famous actor (Boss Chen) does not die here. On the contrary, he takes a trip abroad, and after returning to China, he becomes popular. At the same time, Fang Yunying, who had been knocked down by the patrons, also becomes a sensation. As for Fang Yunying marrying a writer, etc., these are also not in the original work.</p>
<p>"Death of a Famous Actor" is the author's early work, in which the sense of justice of a petty-bourgeois writer is mixed with the subjectivity of "art for art's sake," and expressed in the work. There, the author disguised himself as a famous old actor, singing "Killing the Family to Fish" and other relatively rebellious plays, while also adapting some scripts or creating some scripts suitable for the times. He believes that "actors rely on their skills to make a living," and that only that is the artistic life of a play. Therefore, when he sees his female apprentice, whom he personally taught, fooling around with the patrons and abandoning the cultivation of her acting skills, he feels extremely sad. At the same time, he cannot resist and seize victory over people like Master Yang. Therefore, with his old body, he is killed by the cruel opposing forces. Now, "Fang Yunying" on the screen relaxes the spirit of the famous actor Boss Liu, and places the focus of the play on his female apprentice Fang Yunying. She desperately socializes with the patrons, then suddenly has a great epiphany, marries a writer, and is therefore resented and envied by the patrons. They heckle her in the theater and knock down the extremely popular actress. The writer husband is also monopolized by the bookstore owner and cannot maintain the couple's life. It is not until later that she becomes popular again by following her master after he returns from abroad. We are not saying that such a story is completely unacceptable, but the consistent actions and concepts of the righteous Boss Liu (he went abroad to study drama, but only sat in cafes and sang songs. And the statement "because he once slipped away to a foreign country," etc., seems to be satirizing him.) contradict each other unreasonably, which is inevitably abnormal. Perhaps this is also the reason why the adaptation is not explicitly stated?</p>
<p>As far as the story being presented now is concerned, Fang Yunying's various actions still indicate the playwright's tendency towards moral righteousness. However, because the playwright's expression methods are insufficient, the content of the play is not fully expressed. The true meaning of the play must be discerned by adding some speculation beyond the screen in order to understand it. In principle, film is an art that uses images to think. Therefore, film art must embody the content in images. Otherwise, if it cannot be directly conveyed through the audience's visual and auditory senses, it is not a successful film work. The playwright seems to be very unfamiliar with the techniques of script writing, and the director does not have a deep understanding of the weaving method. Therefore, apart from having to explain the plot with subtitles, the story is fragmented. In particular, the sudden ending makes the audience feel dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the director cannot depict the atmosphere; the people buying tickets to see the play are so listless and powerless, and the theater is so deserted. Also, when the theater owner cannot find Fang Yunying at the beginning, there is no sense of tension, which shows that he does not understand Tempo and cannot grasp the mood of the play. As for Fang Yunying walking into the backstage with several young men at the beginning, and Yang Shaomin looking at Boss Chen, without connecting to a medium shot of Boss Chen washing his hands, and adding many unnecessary long shots or panning shots, all prove that this film has not been well edited. Unclear sound recording also adds to the shortcomings of the work.</p>
<p>Despite this, due to the achievements of photographic technology, many individual scenes are worth seeing. The most brilliant scene is when Fang Yunying and Yang Shaomin return home late at night. The photography and set design are also very good. As for the acting, although the main actors have had some achievements in the past, they seem unfamiliar here because the director has not exercised better control. Even Wei Heling, who was very successful in the stage play "Death of a Famous Actor," cannot create a sad atmosphere in this film due to the limited opportunities for acting and the restrictions of the script. In the end, he is only a supporting actor without any special brilliance.</p>
<h3>Review of "Song of the Rose"</h3>
<p>—华伦</p>
<p>—Xin Guang Screening—</p>
<p>"Song of the Rose" tells the love story of a dancer, which is also her life's tragedy. According to the author, the cause of this tragedy is that the owner of the dance troupe personally tells the protagonist, Mei Xiang, that it is due to "outdated ideas and a snobbish society." Therefore, we can see that the author's main purpose is to express injustice on behalf of one, and therefore all, dancers in the present society against this "outdated thinking and snobbish society," and to stir up people's sympathy with their tragic experiences and miserable lives. In other words, this is a work that quite exposes the cannibalistic nature of the old etiquette and opposes feudalism. But, through the camera, and reflected on the screen, does "Song of the Rose" complete its anti-feudal mission with the power of film art? Unfortunately, according to the author, it will not do what he imagined. Here, he wants to expose and oppose feudalism, but because he understands the feudal forces in the present society too simply, he ends up striking out in vain.</p>
<p>Because the theme is not firmly grasped, what people see is not the entire feudal etiquette, but only the old mother as an individual. Therefore, apart from her, everyone in the whole play loses their individuality. The plays that we see the male lead Shen Xiren and Mei Xiang doing are all forcibly assigned to them by the author. The cousin becomes a puppet that the author uses casually, and the younger sister is only a living backdrop. As for the shortcomings of Mei's younger brother not being explained in the book and Mei Xiang not having a process of doing female labor, these are still minor matters.</p>
<p>The whole play is confusing and chaotic, only seeing cars coming and going, perfunctory scene transitions, and explanations of time, location, and events. Many scenes with great dramatic potential, such as Shen's meeting with his cousin, Shen and Mei Xiang's separation for three or four years, their encounter behind the dance troupe, the stubborn mother's meeting with Mei Xiang, and Shen Xiren's side after losing Mei, are all passed over lightly. Instead, emphasis is placed on Mei Xiang's struggle to earn 200 yuan to redeem love, which is almost a joke, and thus Shen Xiren is written as having no personality whatsoever.</p>
<p>Apart from the three or two "dissolves" in the sickbed, the whole film lacks any "cutaway" techniques to replace all unnecessary scene transitions. The addition of several inappropriate inserted flashbacks makes the already disorganized play even more dull and rigid. For example, when people sing on the beach at the beginning, the camera is stuck on a single shot to the end, only showing the long lyrics, without writing about the surrounding scenery. Also, when the housekeeper comes to report the drought, the mother, daughter, and younger brother huddle in the corner of the bed without any reaction. The younger brother grabs his mother like a noodle and says that his mother is about to die.</p>
<p>In the dance troupe's performance, the camera is also rigidly pointed at the stage, without using the audience to reflect the stage, and forgetting Xiren in the audience. These are all the most basic abnormalities. As for the writing of the hospital, there is no hospital atmosphere. In the third-class ward, a woman can sleep fully clothed until dawn on the bed of a male patient. The hospital staff doesn't wake up in the morning, and the family can come to pick up the patient for discharge. These are all oversights that become jokes.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting, apart from a little movement when he is sick, the male lead's appearance, including his four suits, the unshaven stubble, and the sideburns, remain consistently untrimmed. In terms of posture and movement, if the subtitles didn't say that he had studied abroad and became a professor, no one would see him as a person with such a status. The female lead has a few opportunities to perform. Of course, whether the performance is good enough is another question.</p>
<p>As for photography, not to mention the atmosphere and mood, in most cases, it doesn't even manage to let the audience see the faces of the people in the play clearly. Similarly, the music is not used effectively to help the development of the plot, but is matched with frivolous and extravagant tunes without any principle. There is no correlation between the emotions, book, and music.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter sincerely says that what has been said above may be a bit too strict. For the sake of the progress of the entire film industry, I sincerely hope that the author can use candid words to overcome some objective shortcomings. Naturally, there are also material limitations regarding image composition and sound mixing, etc.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>India's National Humiliation (Clive of India) (2)</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>Clive was startled by Edmund's small gold box on his chest, and muttered to himself, "I have to think of a way. How can I escape this inhuman life?" The lid of the gold box suddenly opened. He stared at a beautiful woman inside. He looked at her for a while, then slowly raised his neck and looked at his friend, saying, "This is..." Edmund said: "That's my sister, Margaret." Clive then looked at it carefully again and said, "Really beautiful... Do you think... she would be willing to come to this place?"</p>
<p>Edmund Macsgreen smiled: "Maybe... but why?" Clive said: "I want to marry her." At this time, Macsgreen frowned, feeling a little annoyed. He thought that Clive's meaningless teasing was a bit too much. But Clive became anxious first, defending himself that he was not joking. Edmund argued with him: "That's useless. If you write to her immediately, it will take six months to get her reply. If you want her to come, it will take a year. But in this place, who can predict what will happen within a year?"</p>
<p>Clive said: "That's right, a lot can happen within a year. But, Edmund, sometimes when I think of something I should do, I have to do it! I know myself, I am not going to grow old in this ditch... Now, after looking at this photo, I know that she is my lifelong partner!" Edmund looked at him, feeling that he was no ordinary person. He had the courage to go forward, and he had the ambition not to fall behind. He was not willing to submit to the environment permanently. So he said, "Then write to her..." But then he wondered again: "Robert, I have never seen you like this, why are you trembling?" Clive's voice trembled: "Don't you understand? When she comes, what will I offer her?"</p>
<p>At this moment, the opportunity of a lifetime arrived for Clive. Just after the two of them finished speaking, there was a burst of military bugle sounds outside, followed by the sound of rapid footsteps running around. A group of busybodies gathered around to inquire about the news from afar. It turned out that the French army had invaded and attacked the British trading port. They led Indian soldiers, wanting to sweep away the British forces. The British base of Madras had already been lost. Clive said to Edmund: "Good. The opportunity has arrived! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"</p>
<p>Edmund hesitated: "Are you talking about the army?" Clive said: "The army. The corrupt army... the army that loves money and fears death... the outdated army, as outdated as bows and arrows in front of guns—what they need is you and me! Are you coming?" Edmund said: "But..." Clive didn't wait for him to finish, and pulled his arm, saying: "I know you will definitely come." He pulled him into Governor Jugde's office. They declared to the governor that they wanted to resign from the company and join the army to fight the French. Rogde was very happy to see the two young men who were brave and promising, and immediately granted their requests.</p>
<p>Thus, they joined the army in a hurry. However, in the midst of his busy schedule, Clive found some time to write a letter and send it back to England. The person receiving the letter was Edmund Macsgreen's sister, Margaret Macsgreen. It is said that Margaret soon received Clive's letter, and a shock arose in her heart. Such an unknown man, merely a colleague of her brother, actually wrote to a woman he had never met, proposing marriage and asking her to go to India, thousands of miles away, to marry him...
