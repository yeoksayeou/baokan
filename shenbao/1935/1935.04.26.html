<h3>國際航業競爭與我國之自衛</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>國際航運競爭因受世界不景氣浪潮之激盪日趨劇烈而遠東一角亦成爲列强角逐之目標美政府旣允撥三千萬美元補助美商大來公司建造新輪擴張遠東航業日本郵船會社亦急起直追圖迅速完成其二十萬噸新式快輪之新計劃大阪商船公司並已自四月起恢復華南航路同時更於日滬綫增添船隻他如德法英意荷挪諸國航商亦莫不積極準備不甘落後本年春間英內閣有航業津貼案之通過以期英國外洋航商能與外國航業競爭營業德國北德公司復有發展遠東航業之大規模計劃素以營業發達見稱之遠東意國郵船公司亦以向在大西洋行駛之三萬三千噸郵船調入歐亞綫充實陣勢以與北德爭衡至於法國郵船公司挪威寶隆公司皆急謀重振以資應付競爭之劇烈局勢之緊張開遠東航運角逐之新紀錄外輪在華本有喧賓奪主之勢而處此情形之下我國之航業更將受鉅大之影饗矣</p>
<p>夫我國航業勢力本極薄弱其不易發展之原因則亦蒼爲複雜列强憑其政治勢力以操縱我內河及沿海之航權一也外商輪船挾其雄厚之資本完密之設備快穩之速率低廉之船價以與我競爭二也國內航商之未能密切合作三也現有船隻年齡之老朽設備之簡陋行駛之遲緩四也政府之未能充分予航業界以實力之援助五也天災兵禍之頻仍影饗船隻之航行六也有斯六因重以捐稅之束縛盜匪之騷擾我國民族航業之能免於阨運者幾希以故自去年以來各路航運皆極度不振華北航路因船多貨少各輪水脚競相跌價以致筋疲力盡虧損甚鉅長江航路自客秋以還雖因水陸聯運之完成營業稍有起色但日商輸船捲士重來駸騷日上殊使我國航業受一打擊華南航路如滬港滬粵粵桂諸綫營業亦皆凋敝不堪且因營業之衰落而國內航商之鬩牆鬥爭亦每愈演愈烈長此以往其情形實至堪憂慮也</p>
<p>交部有鑒於斯曾於去年三月二十日召集全國航商討論促進航業辦怯議案雖有二百餘件其中最主要者厥爲航業合作一案當時卽决定由交部領導上海航業公會及國營招商局合組中國航業設計委員會確立一整個之航業政策使一盤散沙之航業界迫於環境之需要實行精誠之團結</p>
<p>今者中國航業合作理事會將於五月一日成立而合作方案亦經交部批准聞該會之主要職務爲（一）調劑江海各路之航綫（二）依據噸位班次均平貨位之供求（三）實現國營民航之團結合作（四）事事公開永泯爾虞我詐之跌减運費弊害以上所列諾端倘能一一見諸實行則我國航業雖處此競爭劇烈之際日後當有轉機之望</p>
<p>雖然我國航業衰落之根本癥結不盡在同業間之互相水火而與列强以不平等條約爲憑藉對我作有組織有計劃之航業侵略亦有極大之關係故如何收回外人在華之航行權實亦全國上下所宜注意者也</p>
<h3>羅斯福再下令　提高國內生銀價　每盎斯七角七分五釐七　目的在維護美國之利益　傳國際大反響現漸發生</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今晚下令將政府付給國內出礦銀價提高至每盎斯七角七分五厘七亳後、銀派議員紛紛預測銀價不久將漲至一元二角九分、或竟超過此數云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）銀行家與白銀經紀人指世界銀價暴漲、全係印度·與美國等投機家活動所致、謂此數國政府之政策、在實際上强迫美政府提高國內銀價、投機家因此處於極優惠地位、聞白銀價暴漲至六角以上後、美財部未曾在世界市塲購入白銀、估計全世界白銀可立卽繳現者、僅有五千萬盎斯、投機家現不難迅將銀價抬至政府新定價格之上、如欲制止之、則唯有政府宣佈暫行停購或售出白銀耳云、國際大反動現漸發生、此事不獨在中國有進一步之緊縮影響、且亦釀成墨西哥之嚴重形勢、蓋墨幣之本身銀値、以每盎斯七角二分之銀價爲根據、等於墨幣之流通幣値、如世界銀價再漲、則墨國銀幣將有全部鎔毀之虞、果爾則墨國幣制將大素亂矣、若墨政府提高其幣之匯兌上價値、則墨國貿易將受不利影饗、尤以對美貿易爲甚、銀行家預料墨國方面對於美國之白銀政策、亦將責言紛起、與來自中國者同、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日下午頒布命令、將政府給付國內生銀價格提高至每盎斯七角七分五厘七毫、此次增價係減低政府鑄幣稅由百分之四十五至百分之四十而成、總統此項行動殊覺突如其來、因數小時前財部官員猶表示政府不擬再事提高銀價、而財部以後在紐約銀市購買國內生銀之時、將依照世界銀價給價也、據總統命令、此次增價卽予實行、事前財部當局曾忽忽舉行會議、竟一反數小時前宣布之態度、財長毛根韜之怯律顧問亦參加會議、當時曾說明、依照倫敦白銀協定、美國政府必須屯積其全部國內所產白銀、以作幣制上之用途、財部官員數小時前所作聲明顯未注意此項規定、蓋政府如在紐約市塲購銀、恐投機者之價格將超過政府價格、以致美國將不能履行倫敦協定之條件、故總統之命令遂不得不發矣、按政府最近所定銀價、爲每盎斯七角一分一厘一毫、及世界銀價繼續高漲、今晨紐約行市已超過政府價格云、另據銀行家消息、至本年夏季、銀價有提高至每盎斯一元之勢、（廿四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅總統今日提高財部收買國內新出礦白銀之價格、由每盎斯七角一分增至七角七分五七、此爲本月內國內銀價之第二次增高、查第一次之增價、在四月十日由六角四分半增至七角一分、計在兩星期內銀價共增一角三分强、羅總統之命令中謂此舉爲美國利益起見、實屬必要、此說蓋爲世界銀價近來驟漲而發也、籌幣稅原照白銀貨幣價格卽每盎斯一元二角九分之價格徵收百分之四十五、現减收百分之四十、財部對於因銀價高漲而得之利益、或將徵收百分五十之利益稅、此舉志在阻止國內產銀者囤積白銀、以待政府更高價格而獲過份之利益也、國會白銀派議員及西部礦山聞此加價消息、異常興奮、銀派議員仍預料不久銀價將騰至一元二角九分、蓋以財部購銀價格旣已提高、世界銀價亦必隨之而漲也、美國銀礦家根據國外與國內銀價差額而計算其利益、估計因羅總統之舉動彼等已獲有紙上利益一、四六八、二五〇元、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間銀市今日受美國國內銀價現又漲高之影響、價格暴騰、現貨三十四便士八七五、計長兩便士〇六二五蓋投機購進者多而售出者少也、今日銀價達一九二四年十月三十日以後之最高峯、美國之最近發展雖使投機家興奮、但金銀商家則批評美國之政策、美國近來未曾購入白銀、故銀價之漲起、全係投機家操縱所致、彼等此後將更努力抬價、說者謂美國眞正目的、非欲在世界商塲購進白銀、但欲鼓勵投機家提高銀價、藉以和緩國內白銀派議員耳、據專家意見、此種局勢、尙將賡續不已、投機家終有入甕之一日、同時銀行家與金融家對於中國貨幣困難之愈臻嚴重、及墨西哥所受銀價暴漲之反饗、現深加注意、（廿五路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日正式消息、倫敦五金交易所經紀人間之白銀買賣、須每週淸算、此種辦法試行三月、交易所理事並有通吿特別淸算之權、每週淸算之價格、於每星期三日第一屆集會結束時决定之、交割期爲星期五日、星期六日不得舉行特別淸算、交易所經紀人須與其主顧作與此同樣之條約、第一週淸算價格將於五月八日公佈、銅錫每日淸算、星期六日交割者、須早一日結算、而星期日交割者、則展至次日結算、經紀人每週可以其與全顧商定之辦法、或以最少百分之十之存欵向交易所淸算、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）『資本』週報評論白銀市况、謂銀價升漲僅在遠東匯市發生影饗、而使遠東用銀國家之貨幣對美元匯價上升、並謂「大抵銀價漲至每盎斯七角一分又百分之十一時、美國政府必將再度提高正式買價、查美國政府之目的、顯在提高遠東及南美各國貨幣之國際價値、並使白銀恢復匯劃用品之地位、不過此種政策尙未正式宣佈耳」云云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）美國白銀價格之公定市價已漲至美金七角一分八厘半、故水曜會將銀價改爲日金七十九元零二分三厘、比前日漲一元零五分、更因美國政府發表决自今日起增爲美金七角七分五厘七、遂於午後中止出售、明日將提高日金三元或五、六元、（二十五日電通電）</p>
<h3>芝加哥　糧食市暫停營業</h3>

<h3>法俄協定談判復活　蘇聯諒解法國立場　另擬方式俾雙方均可接受　賴伐爾五月赴俄完成手續</h3>
<p>（巴黎）總理佛蘭亭及外長賴伐爾、頃巳於耶穌復活節例假後返京、據可靠方面消息、法俄談判之阻碍、卽兩國須自動的互以兵力援助之問題、刻又進行談判、大約不久可達成熟之境、（二十五日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法俄兩國締結軍事互援協定之困難業巳解决、該約或能於日內簽字、此項消息爲外部今日所發公告之大意、外長賴伐爾亦將於五月六日前往莫斯科、完成一切手續、至於現在所擬定之方式、與原擬草約有何不同、則未經說明、按蘇俄曾堅持兩國中任何一國爲他國侵略之時、其他一國卽當立刻自動給以軍事上之援助、此點法政府亦無異議、惟悉英意兩國不甚贊同、遂使法國猶豫難决、蓋英國外相西門心目中之保持歐洲和平唯一有效方法、卽爲東歐大國於受　武國空軍襲擊之時互相援助、故法國總理佛蘭亭乃召集法學專家、研究如何可使俄法滿意、而同時亦不致觸怒英意、茲悉今日公吿所謂該約或能於下星期簽字、卽爲專家研究之結果云、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於法俄互助公約問題、雙方爭執多日、迄未就緒、頃據事業報載稱、「蘇俄前曾提出要求、雙方苟受第三國侵犯、則互助制度應卽發生機械式之運用、此在怯國則因羅卡諾公約原有之約束、主張應先請求國聯會行政院召集會議、待其認可、始乃以兵力援助對方、厥後法國政府向蘇聯提出折衷案、以爲調和之計、主張締約國之一受第三國侵犯時、卽當要求國聯會行政院召集會議、換言之、卽締約國之一受有侵犯時、雖應提付行政院討論、但締約國雙方苟欲以實力相援助、則亦不必等待行政院召集開會始乃行之」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）法俄協定最近由兩國舉行談判、其中若干細則迄未商得同意、茲悉如無意外事件發生、則人民委員會（卽蘇聯內閣）將於明日開會、討論蘇聯對於此項問題所採取之立塲、又哈瓦斯社記老與熟悉蘇聯外交政策之人士作私人談話後、所獲得之印象、認爲怯俄協定談判前途、魷大體而論、並無不利之趨勢、卽有若干困難决非不可解决、大約蘇聯可望採取一種方式、儘可能範圍內顧及法國之合法顧慮、法國觀　在使所將採取之約束、與怯國已訂結之約束兩者互相諧和、法國一方面期望以適當方法、穩定德國侵略之危險、另一方面亦期望使波蘭易於參加東歐互不侵犯公約、蘇聯方面對於法國此種觀點、業已完全瞭解、據熟悉蘇聯外交政策之人士答稱、法俄協定本無包圍德國之意、不過欲聯合具有和平决心之各友邦、結成充分堅强之陣綫、俾以和平政策抵抗德國帝國主義、遏抑其向外衝突、且最近法國與波蘭關係漸見緩和、蘇聯方面對此亦頗爲滿意、惟蘇聯所始終堅持者、卽目前必須有堅决之行動而對於未來一切事變所產生之瑣細情形、則不宜　　過慮、蓋就過去經騐、每當發生嚴重衝突之時期、就各項法理上微妙之點處處慮到、實屬無關重輕、且對方不恤逕行撕碎條約、而猶欲就法理上作縝密之考慮、不免近於迂闊云、此項談話頗足代表蘇聯當局之見地、又蘇聯各報對於法俄協定之談判完全取絨默態度、蓋恐發表評論或足以妨碍談判之進行、蘇聯具溫和情感、不欲操切從事、於此一事亦足以見之、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意法召集　羅馬九國會議　締結一般不干內政公約　擬定草案徵求各方意見</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英法意三國斯特里薩會議、曾决定在羅馬召集多瑞河九國會議、此項會議現正作種種外交上之準備、意國主張於六月初開會、現已由意法兩國分向奧國·南斯拉夫·德國·捷克·匈牙利·波蘭·羅馬尼亞·等七國邀請參加、參加會議之國家均將派外交部長出席、會議主要目的、在於謀取共同尊重奧國之獨立及領土完整、其方怯則分二種、（一）訂結一般不干涉內政公約、（二）商定上項公約遭破壤時之制裁方怯、關於不干涉內政公約、聞已擬定草案、分送有關各國加以研究、就目前爲止、大多數國家均已接受此項草案、波蘭匈牙利僅在原則上表示接受、德國則要求對於「不千涉內政」之一語、作更確實之解釋、至於碳壞公約時之制裁方法、則係由相關各國在國聯會範圍以內、分頭訂結協定、此項恊定可採取互助公約之形式、且應爲雙方的而非多邊的、倘被邀請之各國均參加多瑙河會議、而參加多瑙河會議之各國均相互訂結此種雙方恊定、則合計當可訂結協定三十六件、惟其中若干國家如波蘭等、或僅接受不干涉內政公約而不願採取其他約束、亦未可知、此外奧匈保三國重整軍備問題、雖亦可在羅馬作有益之討論、但不在正式會議中討論之、蓋多瑙河會議並未將此項問題正式列入議程也、按斯德萊柴會議决定中歐重整軍備問題、須俟一般的及區域的安全保障商定辦法之後、方可加以切實之考慮、因此此項問題僅能在羅馬作非正式之磋商、闢一解决之端緒、最後則當提出國聯會以解决之云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>德國要求　說明五項</p>
<p>（羅馬）多瑙河九國會議預定目標、雖僅限於保障奧國獨立及領土完整、然當籌備會議之際、已引起多種問題、外交當局現正設法、謀在開會之前予以解决、按德國曾於月前照會法意兩國政府、謂一月七日羅馬協定所建議之多瑙河公約、殊欠明確、特提出項問題、要求作詳細之說明、卽（一）瑞士爲奧國之鄰邦、在羅馬協定內、何以未請瑞士加入多瑙河公約、且英國在中歐方面所有利益、殊不遜於法國、何以未請英國參加、意國政府答謂、瑞士係永久中立國、不能簽訂互助公約、英國則除羅加諾公約外、不願採取其他約束故均未邀請加入多瑙河公約、（二）如多瑙河公約簽訂後、則英法意三國對於奧國獨立遭侵犯時、應相互諮詢之協定、（卽去年九月二十七日之英法意三國宣言）是否繼續有效、意國答謂、如有關係各國連同德國在內、均加入不干涉內政公約、則此項諮詢、自可終止施行、（三）不干涉內政公約是否僅以相約不干涉內政爲限、抑簽字國是否必須贊成互助公約、意國答謂、簽約國宜訂結特殊協定、以保障不干涉公約之原則、但簽訂與否、仍可由各國自行决定、（四）所謂「不干涉內政」之確切意義、究係若何、意國答謂、一月七日法意羅馬協定、業加以說明、旣各項煽動及宣傳、以損害簽約國之領土完整、及政治社會制度爲目的者、各簽約國相約不得加以鼓勵或贊助、（五）多瑙河公約實施以後、國聯會將擔當何種任務、意國答謂、國聯會之任務、當然依照國聯會盟約之規定云、以上乃意國政府之解釋、德國接得意國復文後、對於第一、第二、第三問題之解釋、認爲滿意、但對於最後兩問題之答案、則提出異議、德國駐意大使哈塞破、聞曾以私人資格向意國政府詢問、奧國政府倘請求外國與以軍事上之援助、以維持該國政府之地位、是否違反不干涉內政之原則、此外應行研究之問題、尙有多種、其尤重要者、則爲匈牙利與南斯拉夫關於馬賽暗殺案爭端之最後解决、　匈牙利重整軍備問題、特匈牙利重整軍備、必俟中歐安全制度先行建立以後、方可實行耳、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>財孔抵滬談　望國人愛用國貸　不以進口貨賤而大量購買　救濟工商業三行拆放钜欵</h3>
<p>中央社云、行政院副院長兼財政部部長孔祥熙氏、前晚十一時、乘坐夜車、離京來滬、昨晨七時十分、抵眞茹下車、逕返西愛咸斯路私邸休息、旋於傍午、前往中央銀行、處理要公、並接見新聞記者、發表下列之談話、</p>
<p>深望國人　重視國幣</p>
<p>據孔氏謂、美國提高銀價、影饗我國、乃人所共知、其原因爲我國並不產銀、且爲入超國家、在正面上看、進口貨物代價、當較前賤、反之、出國貨物、必因之而價昂、以致外銷力减少、如是一方進口增加、一方出口增少、入超必更鉅、綠國際貿易、本藉出口貨物相抵、今不足之數益增、則我應償外國貨物之現金益鉅、但希望我國人有愛國心、不圖牟利、重視本國貨幣、不因外幣之廉而收換、致國幣外流、並努力提倡愛用國貨、不以進口貨賤而大量購買、則此層殊不足爲患、</p>
<p>現金外流　不足爲慮</p>
<p>至於恐我現金將再因銀價激增而流出一節、此更不足慮、現在如外商銀行家、目光遠大、抱有百年大計、前已與我金融界商洽合作、不運白銀出口、决不致僅顧目前利益、投機交易、蓋此種行爲、實爲目光遠大之正當商人所不取也、卽使有人意存破壞、則至萬不得已時、政府儘可提高平衡稅、爲有效之應付、</p>
<p>三行拆放　七八百萬</p>

<p>含飴之樂</p>
<p>惟邇來該氏因其寡媳李月桂脫離家庭、已有六七年之久、且會登報聲明、將欲冉醮、故特着將寶弟交還、但李月桂堅决不允、於是孫王氏遂延鄂森律師、向第一特區地方法院提起確認對於孫女寶弟應有監護權之訴、而李月桂則以其翁孫鑑全之全部遺產、不下二十萬、現悉在姑掌握、因亦以其女寶弟之法定代理人名義、延律師對孫王氏提起</p>
<p>分析遺產</p>
<p>之訴、謂該項遺產、約計二十萬、除其姑孫王氏、應得半數外、餘應歸伊故夫孫同慶之子女五口、及伊本身作六份分配、俾伊母女兩人、藉以維持生活云云、昨日下午、先由喬萬選推事開庭傳審、孫王氏所訴確認監護權之案、因被告李月桂臨訊不到、經喬推事僅向原告孫王氏略訊一過、即論展期、繼由章慶瀾推事傳審分產案、李月桂係屬原告、遂携其十四齡</p>

<p>當我二十八歲時、我母患病、竟不許歸省、種種虐待情狀、實難罄述、是年我會一度自殺、遇救未果、苟延至次年二十九歲、實覺不堪同居、始挈女兒寶弟離家、原欲再度自殺、因慮此女無人撫養、遂仍偷生、我翁全部遺產、被告昔曾對我云、有二十萬、今特請求依法分析云云、言時</p>
<p>淚承於睫</p>
<p>而被告孫王氏之代表律師鄂森、即將報紙一張呈案、並稱李月桂嘗於十九年委託律師代表、登報聲明、晚離被告家庭、且有再醮之表示寶弟乃被告之子同慶所生、被告以李月桂旣有此毬表示、故着其將寶弟交還、俾與其他孫兒女同受教育是以提起確認監護權之訴、該案適已開庭、因李月桂不到、展期至五月四日再審、乃李月桂於其</p>
<p>姑起訴後</p>
<p>亦提起分產之訴、以一於數年前、曾經登報聲明、將欲再醮之人、今忽主張分析遺產、其意顯然、是以應請庭上將本案暫行中止、俟確定監護權一案判决、再行核辦、否則對於該案之審判、不無窒礙耳、李月桂聞語、速稱登報僅係意思之表示、</p>
<p>並未實行</p>
<p>再醮、庭上旋傳被告孫王氏訊問、該氏雖屆古稀之年、而精神矍鑠、耳聰目明、聲音淸朗、望之猶如五十許人也、據稱、李月桂前雖係其媳、今已數年在外、縱未公然改　、料當已有姘頭、但孫女爲我子所生、故應向索還、俾可與其餘孫輩同受教育云云、章推事隨諭變方出外試行和解、不成　候續審、</p>

<h3>白虹舉行運動會　廿八日在虹口公園　與中華對抗决改期</h3>
<p>國光社云、白虹田徑隊、將於本星期日（廿八日）在虹口公圍、舉行本隊運動會、因虹口公園爲預防公共危險、禁止舉行外、其他短中程長跑、及田賽等、將逐項舉行、此屆因本外埠隊員、均因參加國際七團體賽關係、健將如劉長春程金冠·李世明·陳寶球·冷培根·顧或。王健吾等、均　集滬上、故成績將出吾人之預料、不難打破多項之紀錄、惟上一日之國際賽、白虹將出全力以爭、各隊員經此激烈之運動、成績或恐稍受影響、至前傳二十八日與中華對抗一節、業已决定改期、</p>
<h3>我做籃球裁判的哲學（三）</h3>
<p>— 美國達爾氏著錢一勤</p>
<p>關於犯規影響及比賽結果、至若何之程度、曾經加以研究、且目下尙在研究之中、在　于歲運動月刊上關於此點、著者實作文加以相當之評　此種研究之中、並未包括球員及教練員之錯誤、故盡將宣布犯規之責任、置於一般裁判員之肩上、而關於比賽中其他之因素、（如各隊投籃未中之分數等）未加列入、實不公平、</p>
<p>倘將此種因素陳列而出之、則此種情形、必全形改變、在一接近之比賽中、一隊因負三分而告敗北、查比賽記錄簿上、則該隊擲籃未中之球、有四十九次之多、賽後沐浴之際、裁判員被失敗隊之隊長所留難、責其未能多多宣判對方守衛之犯規、致其前鋒被阻、不克進攻、而告失利、此係失敗隊隊長主要之爭點、彼從未思及其本隊投籃四十九次而未中、且該項投籃係近在籃邊、設其本隊投籃略準、僅須有如許機會中之少數、則該比賽之記錄、自當逈然不同、</p>
<p>前述意見之撮要　以上之意見、爲對於初學裁判者而書、以下更有特殊之意見數點、尙待甲述、在未申述之前、著者欲重將業已提出之意見、撮要而述之、</p>
<p>（一）裁判之成功初無秘密之方式、刻苦工作已佔戰勝之大半、必獲最後之成功、更加之以歡喜及深愛爲裁判之心、須遠勝於任何物質之報酬、决無僅以金錢之收獲爲目的、而望獲眞正之成功者、故必常存深愛此種遊戲之精神、如其不然、則爲裁判者、直等於行尸走肉耳、至若執法不善、則金錢之報酬斷難安慰其賽後內心之痛苦、即或能使其對於不平之批評、堪以自慰、但絕不足以慰其喉下不安之感、倘其比賽時執法不良、及判決適當、致有碍比賽之結果、故第一之建議爲、汝果欲裁判成功、必須刻苦工作繼續不斷、</p>
<p>（二）比賽時、須盡照規則而宣判、是故規則上之每一條例、均須十分純熟、無需携帶規則至塲上、其實、能將初任裁判員之一點猶豫心理移去、而存自信之心、則規則無須帶在身邊矣、</p>
<p>（三）規則純熟後則僅須按照規則而宣判、無私無畏、</p>
<p>（四）目光須敏捷、且明察秋毫、一人獨自執行裁判時、並須兼顧球與球昌聚集以外之其他部份、尤其在跳球之時須顧及後面、所謂頭後須有眼是也、</p>
<p>（五）僅有敏捷之目光、尤爲未足、尙須加以迅速與立刻之判斷力、施行判决、在犯規發現後、隨即宣布之、在此方面格外加意、則任裁判之困難自尠、</p>
<p>（六）無論與何人接觸——球員教練員其他職員、以及觀眾——均須切實而不多事、有禮而不阿諛、須知自制＼之可貴、不亞於規則之純熟、常識之豐當、　斷之敏捷與夫胸懷之勇敢、不問任何之情形、可以發生、不問任何人可以失態、身爲裁　員者不得如此、許多觀眾可因比賽之緊張得意忘形、惟此屬彼等之權利、其實彼等在比賽時之驚狂、出有代價在比賽緊張熱烈之際、球員及教練員失其自制力、乃常有之事、此不過人之常情耳、惟任裁判員者、在緊張熱烈之際、自始至終、均須自持、及繼續冷靜、不問球員或教練員之過失若何厲害、仍須如此、當球員或教練員之言行越界不合禮時、自然可以與以處罰、予對方一次自由投籃、惟如宣　技術犯規、必須、重而出之、及處執之、</p>
<p>對待觀衆之態度　切勿利用技術上之特質、予一隊自由投籃與觀眾爲敵、向觀眾宣判犯規之習慣、常對於被罰之一隊、不得其平、因觀眾之所爲、常與此似乎應得之處罰、亳不相關、據著者多次之經騐、不如停止比賽、將宣判犯規之原因、加以說明、較爲妥當、在觀眾中之一般有良好精神者、常能制止其中不良之份子、有時此種方法不能施行、則最好能全　觀眾於度外、曾有一次著者連讓一隊自由投籃至八次之多反對之觀眾方始安靜、而安度此雖關、但其思及觀眾倘仍然不止、則將如何處置、不勝戰慓、是故仍以他毬方法爲妙、雖最後之所依報者、仍不得不出於穴判一次觀眾犯規之一途、以上六點爲成功裁判之綱要、讀者如願成爲一裁判員更須加以常識及勇敢、則其已獲成功之初　矣、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （寒吻）</p>
<p>有人論中國婚姻制度之變象云：「中國婚姻的變象、約分（一）典婚，（二）贅婚，（三）轉婚，（四）童養婚，（五））等郎婚，（六）搶婚，（七）招夫養夫婚，（八）冥婚八種」。可謂五花八門，可惜沒有人把八種都嘗試過，否則如果都嘗試過了，倒是嘗　了酸，甜，苦，辣，　啦。</p>
<p>據說張宗昌曾經這樣地教訓他的兒子說：「你看老子一身是膽，你們只知道讀書，咱老子一字不識，也做這大事業，中國失業的人多，都是因爲受了教育。」按其語雖荒謬，平心思之，亦頗幽默。</p>
<p>吳稚暉老先生近日語人云：「解救國難，祇在走通三條大路，卽可奏功，第一是復興農村，第二是完成勦匪計畫，第三是多備最新式武器。」果能如此做去，那末失地卽可收回，國難自然解除了。</p>
<p>魯省主席韓復榘氏，治魯極嚴，如果捕到烟犯，再犯的就執行槍决，初犯的便在烟犯的額角上刺一「義」字，據說是把「義」字顛倒拆開來是我王八」也。</p>
<h3>臉</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>唱戲的，得鈎臉。鈎成紅臉的，是忠，鈎成黑臉的，是勇，鈎成白臉的，是奸，鈎成花臉的，是引人發笑的小丑，——鈎成某一種臉的，便是代表某一種人的身份。</p>
<p>我想，假使這個世界上的眾生相，都像唱戲的那麼能表示出內心中的意念的，那麼，這個世界，該怎麼的太平，這個社會該怎麼的靜穆呀？自然，我想，最低的限度，總也用不到再爾虞我詐的了，因爲任何人的胸中城府，不難給人洞燭得瞭如指掌。這正合了「人心之不同，各如其面」的一句話了。</p>
<p>但是，這，不過是一種妄想，這不過是優伶們在舞臺上搬演的一幕而已。在實際上，在這個社會上，儘有强盜面孔，菩薩心腸的，也儘有菩薩面孔、强盜心腸的，——雖然强盜面孔，强盜心腸，或是菩薩面孔，菩薩心腸的，也未始沒有。</p>
<p>上帝造人，爲甚麼要造成這許多不同的臉？這眞是一個千古所不能打破的大啞謎。但是我想，這許多不同的臉，也能像優　那麼的表示着各種人的地位與性格，豈非可以省却這個世界上的不少鈎心鬥角的勾當？無奈上帝造人，偏是不這麼。</p>
<p>這眞是令我有些兒惘然！</p>
<h3>血</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>血，是人身上再也可貴不過的東西。人的身子裏，血少了，便會得病，甚至死亡。血，在普通的身子裏，還不過維持着生理作用而已，可是烈士腔子裏的血，那可就非同小可，——可以喚起國魂，可以洗滌國恥，可以因之而規復河山，可以因之而振頑立懦。但是這種血是太可貴了，意義是太重大了，所以除了千古不朽的烈士所僅具之外，在一輩庸庸碌碌者的身子裏，是休想找得到一滴二滴，雖然同是那麼的鮮紅色的。</p>
<p>在低級社會裏，血是金錢的一個代名詞，似乎就是表示着血與金錢同爲人生所不可或缺的。但是我們却時常可以見到百萬富翁，害着貧血症的，雖然有那麼多的金錢，但是醫學上還沒進步到把花花綠綠的鈔票，輸入體內的程度呢。</p>
<p>可是近來聽得人家說，我們的東鄰，很有些貧寒的大學生，因無錢求學，於是把自己的血，賣給醫院裏、輸給貧血的有錢人。如此說來，富人的金錢，簡直就是血，窮人的血，也就是金錢，那麼血與金錢，一而二，一一而一，在邏輯上說來，怕也並無不合吧。</p>
<p>若是血與金錢，二位一體論，是可以成立的，那麼我們愛血，便該愛金錢，愛金錢，也使該愛血。用洋貨，把金錢流出去，便是流着我們的血。這種血留着，是可以使國家富强的。——所以在這裏，我祝福着大家把一切血，寶貴些兒，莫讓它輕輕地流掉。</p>
<p>宜乎用遠大的目光以看到一切</p>
<h3>怪姓正誤</h3>
<p>— 微雨</p>
<p>前日本刋曾刋怪姓一稿，早有尢姓一字，謂音汪，實爲大誤，尢爲尤之古字，凡稍完備之字典，卽有記載，姓尢者，卽爲姓尤，絕非音汪也。　我國各地，姓無點之尤者甚多，凡無錫蘇州之尤姓，皆無一點，而姓尢字，均屬尢父簡公之後裔，蘇州如劉家浜尢，鳳凰街尢，皆姓尤而少一點者，劉家浜尢，爲昔年蘇州首紳尢先甲鼎孚，其子孫極多，從未聞呼之爲汪鼎孚也。上海小日報之尢毅　，卽尢半狂之化名，亦非汪半狂也。故以尢姓而音汪，寶誤。</p>
<p>至何以尤有無點之姓，而其來源如何，則微雨不敏，未能詳考，或謂因尤字有點形如犬字，故去其點，此說似太無稽，惟尢爲尤之古字，則可以考，尢字音汪，固屬不謬，但尢姓，則仍應音尤，不能音汪，猶單字入姓音善而不音堆也。（又十二日劉訓微君「談姓」中之菱湖昭，係別署，並非姓菱，特此更正，編者附誌）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>老畫師家趣宴</h3>
<p>— 轉陶</p>
<p>老畫師丁悚家裏的宴會，我們是時常參與的；前天晚上，承厲志山律師的邀，又在他家裏玩了一個整晚；這一晚，雖然雨絲風片，可是大家的興味，來得格外濃厚，厲律師雖是個有名的法學家，可是與文藝界特別有緣，這天他所邀的，大一半是有名的人物，我赴宴的時候，已經來了好幾位佳賓，使我最觸目的，便是瘦長的電影皇帝金燄，他是怎樣一個英爽的人物，酒量爲最宏，他喜歡喝啤酒，一杯一杯又一杯，可惜婦小的王人美女士，因爲拍戲，來得遲了，大概十點鐘的光景，門外有一陣叩門聲，小丁先生把門開開，原來是野貓一跳一跳的進來了，金燄慌忙把全身躱到了圓台下面，大家一陣歡呼，說道：老金已經喝醉酒去了。人美說：他去了也不要緊，但是伊終究不相信，四下裏一找，便找到了。</p>
<p>喝酒的敘了一席，不喝酒的也敘了一席，主人也是個豪於欽的，所以他隨身帶了二十四個酒令來，每人抽一個，最使人狂笑的，半狂抽了個學三聲狗呌，袁美雲小姐的尊人樹德先生，抽了個學三聲貓呌，他們因爲不肯呌，便罰了三杯酒，雄飛抽着了呌丁師母三聲姆媽，他很爽氣的呌了三聲，而且很親暱，大家說：小丁先生多了一個哥哥了。</p>
<p>女賓連丁師母祇有四位，袁美雲小姐固然是大家注目的人物，伊不施脂粉，態度是有禮而靜默的，伊是怎樣有藝術天才，而有偉大的前程啊！此外嚴斐同歐陽飛莉兩位歌星，也調和了不少空氣。</p>
<p>溢芳兄同嚴斐小姐抽得了唱歌，嚴小姐本是歌聖，毫不畏縮的唱了一隻「蘇三不要哭；」溢芳却也不甘示弱，唱了一齣捉放曹，大家說：味道比了麒麟　還足，有人要他們再來一個，他們沒有答應，有人抽得了女客燙髮的喝酒，眞奇怪，四位女賓中，竟沒有燙髮的，伊們說：是提倡新生活運動，後來發現嚴小姐的秀髪，微微有些　曲，大家便要伊唱，伊不肯，說是天生如此，怎麼可以呌我喝，有人又抽得了男客沒有頭髪的唱，陳聽潮的頭髮最短，大家硬要呌他喝，他說：我剃的是平項，怎麼可以喝，但是都拗不過大眾的公意。</p>
<p>席散了，金燄，丁悚，逸芬，半狂，同主人志山，還賭喝啤酒，丁師母本來也是個宏量，道一天因爲眼睛有些紅，所以喝得很少，小鬍子吳天翁久違了，這天他依舊是戴着紅結子的瓜皮帽，拿着司的克，半狂說：天翁可算是　德俱增了，吳翁道：還是讓給袁老先生吧。</p>
<p>這種文藝界有趣的宴會，近來很少，但是丁老畫師的家裏，還時常有得點綴。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避各辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>志前很同意於周有容的主張，於是向王北海招了招手北海在今天這種情形之下，實在沒有心去補習功課。不過先生招手呌他去，且帶了書走來。到了周有容屋子裏，首先所看到便是大大小小，疊了很高的一堆報紙，於此，可以想到他是很關心時事的人。他兩手將桌上的報紙一抱，放到墻角落裏去，笑道，現在桌子寬敞了，你們可以工作了。北海道：那也不忙，等一會到程先生屋子裏去補習也可以的。周有容道：大概你是不能安心在我這裏看書聽講。其實現在的時代不同了，像古人一樣，要找到深山幽谷要去念書，已經不可能了。一來是現在念的書，以科學爲基礎，不但要先生說明，而且還要儀器來實騐。二來讀書做官，不是現在的事，現在是要學技能到社會上去謀生活。人到了社會上，隨處也要和人羣接觸，而且現代社會很複雜的，一個公司裏的辦公室，往往有幾十個人在一處辦事。若是下筆列表作稿，不在讀書的時候，就練習了不怕人吵擾，到那個時候，就有些無從下手了。所以我最不贊成古人下帷讀書那個辦法。志前道：你的話是很對的，不過北海並不是怕你吵了他，却是怕他吵了你。周有容道：我最贊成用功的年輕人，我是不怕人家讀書來吵我的。（一九一）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>後來呢？也不過是這頂帽兒上拆：那雙鳳鞋上釘，互相移用而已，否則是决不够支配的。好在珍珠這樣東西，本身非常耐用，除非你用東西去　它，輕易是不會破碎的，所以待到某一雙鳳鞋因歷時過久（决非使用過久，更談不到破舊兩字。）而不需再保存了，鞋身便棄去，却將那些珍珠一齊拆下來，交給製鞋的藝工們收拾好，以便裝點新鞋之用。</p>
<p>鞋面上釘珍珠的方法也有兩種：第一種就是我上面所講的，先用絲綫把珍珠串了起來，然後再把這絲綫釘到那鞋面上去；第二種是直接把珍珠一顆顆地釘在鞋面上，就用珍珠來代替彩綫，釘成各式各樣的花紋。這種釘法，不但此較結實一些，而且還較繡了花再釘珠子來得淸靜文雅。記得我初進宮沒有多少時候，見了這種光以珍珠爲花飾的鳳鞋，便不由自主地讚美起來；再加還未熟知太后的脾氣，竟公然露出了很羨慕的神態，太后脾氣偏是最喜把人家所羨慕着的東西賞給人家，於是伊就立卽教人揀出了兩雙一般以珍珠爲花飾的鳳鞋賞賜給我，我自然很歡喜地受了。但從此我見了伊的新鞋，再也不敢這樣贊美羨慕了，不然的話，也許伊竟會絕不吝惜地把鞋庫中所藏的全部鳳鞋賞給我了！可是我雖沒有得到那麼許多，但統計太后前後所賞給我的，也確有好幾十雙了：至今我還寶藏着三四雙咧！（三〇一）</p>

<h3>小品文與個性</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>在一般的小說和劇本裏，所謂「個性的表現」，有着兩種意義。。其一是「人物」的個性的表現，就是把「故事」中人物的姿態和性情寫得透達，勞工像個勞工，農人確如農人，靑年其着靑年的特徵，老人有老人的樣子；而且，是從事什麼的靑年，是多少年紀的勞工，是男子還是女性，都刻　得詳詳細細，自自在在；對於人物所抱的中義和所懷的思想，也都直接問接的顯露得一目了然。其二是作者自己的個性的表現；這於思想主義以外，還有着「地方色彩」，「時代性」和「民族性」等等的關係。</p>
<p>要表得出作者自己的個性，才是成熟的作品。大文豪的個性生得强烈，於無形中流露得濃厚；所以他們的作品，即使不曾署名，巳經看慣了他們別的作品的讀者，也是認得出來的。不過在一般的小說和劇本上，所謂個性的表現，是更注重在第一意義上面的，尤其在新文學；因爲目的在於問題的探討，只要寫得認　，富於「實感」，能勾引起讀者的「共嗚作用」而發生良好的影饗，價值已經有了。而且，對於人物的個性的表現，可以故意的努力做到；作者自己的個性，須於無意中流露，出於自然，是可致不可求的。</p>
<p>小品文不必有一定的「結構」，無須遵守「三一律」，不妨鴻着主觀的興感，隨彎倒彎的寫去；對於人物的個性，當然不能勾拘執着詳細的描寫。而且篇幅來得小；短篇小說將不像長篇小說和劇本的着重人物個性的詳表，只以揭要爲妙；何况小品文，是要並提多端的。</p>
<p>照上所說，在小品文裏，人物個性是難以表現的，至少不能够暢達。那末作者自己的個性怎樣麼？這可是重要的了；不必有一定的結構，無須遵守三一律，好像是容易從事的。雖然容易從事，但要寫得有精采，能够出色，就爲難了。問題正在於來得自由；大家都可以隨便做得，非有獨到之處，難以使人注意。所以小品文，總要表得出作者自己的個性，就是有了相當的成熟，才容易動人。——一般的小說和劇本，或者可以應用理知的「技巧」使得出色；能够動人的小品文却必須有相當的自然流露的情感。</p>
<p>或者以爲情感是盲目的，由於自然流露的情感，對於人生問題的探討，未免缺乏意義，或者居然錯誤。其實不然，只要所懷抱的主義是偉大的，思想是正確的，雖然由於無意中的流露，總也不至於不對了。原來，富於一種思想的人，總也富於這種思想的情緒；譬如富於革命思想的人，情緒上總也是富於革命性的。懷抱了一種主義的人，思想上總是偏在一面，就是有着「成見」的，對於各項事物的觀察，總像是戴着一種顏色眼鏡的。所以，同是一匹馬，晝家總是專在色彩形狀上着眼，軍官和醫師大概專在肥瘦和强弱上着眼，生物學者却是在肢體的組織和性情上着眼的。</p>
<p>由於自然的流露，無從做作，不容虛偽，才是作者的眞面目。所以小品文，雖然是短短的，在「人格的表現」這文學的基本原則上，倒是占着重大地位的。</p>
<h3>大青山</h3>
<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>我們一行六十多個人分坐了四輛大汽車，向着蒙古的原野駛去。出了歸化的近郊，走進了這橫亘塞外的大靑山（註一）前面是一條長長的山溝，水已經乾得沒有了，大大小小的靑石頭，當汽車駛過去的時候，把坐在車上的我們一陣陣顛動起來。</p>
<p>在我們前面走着些穿着破而污垢的短衣服的步行者，各個人背上和肩上掮了一個不大的包袱——那裏面捆了他們全部的行李。爲了生活，他們離了溫暖的家，去荒漠中墾地，種莊禾，做小買賣，到了年底才帶着賺了的幾個錢回家過一些幸福的日子，他們有一句行話是「走後山的一（註二）這些人就是走後山的人。</p>
<p>汽車駛進了山口，後面的兩輛汽車却突然看不見了。</p>
<p>山上沒有多少樹。草還是枯黃的，只幾株矮小的揚柳樹在山坡上被風吹着搖曳；從歸化到武川的電信桿子矗立在山頭及山坡上，山中除了些「走後山的」人和偶而從對面來的幾輛牛車外，聽不到一點聲音：只有我們的同伴者的高聲的歡唱，還給寂靜的山谷中添了些熱鬧。</p>
<p>穿過了亂石溝，走到了壩口，後面的兩輛汽車依舊沒有來，等了一點鐘，幾個人下去在入口的山坡上望了望，看不見一點影子。和我們同行的一輛汽車却先開走：於是我們也决定不再等了。</p>
<p>走出了壩口村口，不到多遠，便看見了等着我們的那一輛汽車，幾個女孩子跳下車來在一株枯樹下坐着發愁：「走不走呢？」大家都這樣問。「走的，走的！我們到武川去等他們吧！」最後終於巡樣决定了。</p>
<p>走不到二里的光景，汽車便要爬一個狠陡的山坡了，山坡入口的塊方，是幾堵用亂石砌成的牆和幾間小土房子，有幾家寫着留人小店的白字；老人和一些纏足的婦女，小孩用驚奇的眼光看我們，都在低低的說：「看！哪兒來得這麼多洋學生，咦！還有不梳髻的女學生呢！」</p>
<p>汽車嗚嗚地呌了幾聲，前面的另一些一走後山的一人爬上山坡的小徑走了，車爬上了山坡，向後傾立起來，像要把我們倒下去的樣子，汽車走得那麼慢，在一個山角轉灣處女孩子們坐的汽車先爬上去了，土飛起來，衝向每一個人的鼻中來，她們揮着手帕在對我們這一輛車中的人示意，這時候，我向下一看，心不禁拍，拍地跳起來，我們如今快要爬到山頂了，歸化城在我們眼前只是黑森森的一團，山的陰處還積着狠厚的雪，氣候也比先前冷一點了。</p>
<p>汽車爬到了最高的山頂，立着「鄂博」（註三）的地方，便是往下走的山坡，這裏，已看不見城市，只是山頭的積雪和白雲在那裏互相輝映。</p>
<p>往下走是好走一點的，汽車像蝸牛似地慢慢開下去，拐轉處是必須非常小心的，否則便會有從山上翻入溝中的危險。</p>
<p>在最後的山坡上，一坐山神廟矗立在那裏，眞是有「一夫當關萬夫難入」的氣概，在山坡與溝的連接處，岩上有吉鴻胃在民國十四年刻的「化險爲夷」四個大字到了這裏我們的一條心才放了下來。</p>
<p>下了山坡，又走入了山溝，這回却有水淙淙的在流。冰還沒有消盡，積雪滿堆在冰上，山風吹起來的時候，竟會把像紙片的薄冰，簌簌的吹起來，像是些小蝴蝶在飛。</p>
<p>走出了山溝，巳快要黃昏了，土地的顏色也變了起來，紅的，黑的，黃的土，武川縣城的低小的城垣在我們眼前現了出來，因爲等候那兩輛汽車，晚上我們就在這裏住了下來。</p>
<p>註一，「大靑山」即陰山。註二，「走後山的」意即到大靑山後面的蒙古原野和武川縣屬鄉村謀生的人，註三，「鄂博一係蒙語，譯漢話爲土堆，蒙人用以做標記者。</p>

<p>會意地看爸的乾癟嘴唇，</p>

<p>一出世原就在這迷濛的境地。</p>
<p>別人家華麗的孩子經過他，</p>

<p>眼睛述看都不敢睜看看，</p>
<p>他怕那大人手里的打狗棒。</p>

<h3>山中牧歌（五）</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>漢子接着旱烟，就將牠　在嘴上，烟管也不用地便使勁地吸了起來。眼睛一面瞟着站在那邊要來又不大敢來的秦老板：向老陳道：</p>
<p>「他，是你們一夥的麼？」</p>
<p>「不，只是同路的！」老陳這樣回答了之後，就高聲地喊道：「喂，秦老板過來息息呀！」</p>
<p>而且特別把秦老板三個字呌得高，彷彿故意使人個意那麼似的。</p>
<p>秦老板慢慢地走了過來，現出驚疑和不安的臉色。</p>
<p>漢子看見秦老板走路足一拐，拐的，等他走攏了之後，才問道：</p>
<p>「哪，你這位朋友是沒走過長路的麼？」</p>
<p>『嚇，他道位先生，那裏像我們賣氣力的：磨骨頭養腸子。人家做洋貨生意的大老板，你都看不出來麼？」</p>
<p>到這時，連老陳也冒稱苦力起來了。秦老板聽見在這樣情形之下奉承他，好像學徒挨了師傳的耳巴子一樣，連忙做出訴苦的神氣申辯道：</p>
<p>「我，我哪裏像一個老板呢？嘴巴子眼睛一點兒也配不上哪！只是替人家掛掛賬。說起來，也是帮人的呀，人家叫我做啥我就做啥，哪裏及得上你們做小生意的呢？自家有本錢，誰也不敢管！我們這些打算盤珠子的站在大老板面還敢哼一口氣麼。」</p>
<p>秦老板口才也不弱於別人的，除了替自己辯護而外，還竭力把老陳冒充苦力的面幕揭穿。</p>
<p>漢子好像不愛聽道些話似的摘下烟枝向着老徐問道：</p>
<p>「喂，你挑得有糕餅麼？」</p>
<p>老徐紅着臉侷促地回答，一面用手無意識地騷着耳朶。</p>
<p>「沒有呀，只是挑些七古八雜的東西，一個銅板也值不起，丟在路邊上，恐怕別人瞧都不瞧哩！」</p>
<p>漢子把烟枝彈去一點灰，重復啣在嘴上，就用力地大吸一口，閉緊了眼睛，好像烟的美味巳使他完全忘記面前還有旁人那麼似的。</p>
<p>老陳對着秦老板一直恨恨地鼓着眼睛，這陣才掉開視綫，朝漢子的臉上打量，擔心地問道</p>
<p>「請問你老哥是做的啥個生意哪？」</p>
<p>漢子張開眼睛，笑着反問道：</p>
<p>「你看看，我是做啥個生意的？』</p>
<p>「嗯！……」</p>
<p>老陳紅起了臉，回答不出來。</p>
<h3>渡淮水</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>車輪在凹隆不平的石塊鋪的小街上拉過去，坐在車上顛得肚裏難過透了。</p>
<p>到輪碼頭時，鬆了一口氣，走下來，跟楫先生兩個兒走下小輪船去，一瞧艙裏艙外，烟棚船梢上，全是客滿，問船夫呌他給我們找一個站站身的地方，看他思索了一回，大概我們穿着一件長袍的緣故吧：幾乎很優待的領我們到一間船上管賬先生做住房的小房間內去，容積可以坐四五個人，現在我們兩個人坐到裏面，也够舒服。</p>
<p>九點鐘的時間已到，而船老是嗚嗚拉聲，不開出去。</p>
<p>不開船總有原因呢！</p>
<p>突然窗口，一個船夫探頭進來跟我們說：——請你們坐到外邊去吧！</p>
<p>——奇怪，你呌我們進來的哩！外面有空地方嗎？你說爲的什麼事？</p>
<p>——我們不開船爲等一位官長，這房間要讓給官長來坐。</p>
<p>這話眞使我們一氣。</p>
<p>——不興，你請官長來一起坐好哩，咱們不走了。我跟他說。</p>
<p>因爲官長還沒有來，那個船夫挨延着臉去了。沒一回，又把頭探進窗來，表情幾乎是懇求的樣子。</p>
<p>—請…請你們坐到外邊吧！官長快來了。</p>
<p>—你請官長進來，我們一起坐，還够坐位呢！</p>
<p>—不，官長有衛隊，官長應該一個人坐的。</p>
<p>—鬼話，那個規定你們船上這間小房只應該做官長的坐。</p>
<p>我們終於沒有走，我想眞不知什麼了不起的官長，官長趁船，把小百姓趕起來，做官總是有威風的；偏是我們倆個太可惡，不怕官，這可眞有點沒法想。</p>
<p>開船的時間已誤了一個鐘點，船還是不開，因爲官長還沒有到；一船的小百性沒法想，只好擠得苦煞的恭等。</p>
<p>終於那個官長在誤了一個半鏡點的開船時間後來了，帶着一們像孩子似的小衛兵，到我們那間小房裏來了。</p>
<p>原來所謂官長，是一位某軍的連長，穿灰色舊軍服，一張老槍臉，黃，瘦；我像早知有什麼不好的預兆似的，趕忙讓他坐，然而他還沒坐下，在喉嚨一裏哼了一下，兩口濃痰吐倒船板上了，差些兒黏到我鞋背上。</p>
<p>呌他的衛兵把我們的行李推過一邊，就不顧什麼的橫下來睡了，船還沒有開出半里路，連長已呼之的大打鼾了。</p>
<p>這時候我跟楫先生才有點懊惱，早知那麼一位長官要進來，我們還是讓他一個人坐，立到船頭上看水浪去淸爽多啦！</p>
<h3>跳舞馬拉松（五）</h3>
<p>— （美國J．T法來耳作）宜閑譯</p>
<p>他的舞疲乏了，她把臂膀挽住了他的項頸或是屁股，把頭靠在他身上，睡過去，他有氣無力地拖着她在地板上轉來轉去，當他睡熟的時候，她對他也照樣的辦。幾次三番，他們兩人的身子互相碰撞着，搖　着，推動着，於是他發生了對她的慾望，覺着她的親近漸漸變得苦悶了。尤其當夜更很深，跳舞廳里看客零落的時候，他深深地注意到她動不動就把身子在他身上擦一陣，熱辣辣地看着他的眼睛，對他說些淫蕩的笑話。別的跳舞者也變得這樣有幾個對他說，給什麼女郎惹得渾身穌軟了。</p>
<p>一天復一天「馬拉松」繼續着。他的兩眼沈重了。他的背脊痠痛了。他的兩脚又痠又僵，走一步就痛一陣，他往往覺着彷彿在火上踏着似的，跳舞廳裏乎不絕地裊繞着香烟的姻霧，瀰漫着人體的混濁的氣味。他身上覺得幾乎盡是骯髒的，汗淋淋的，癢仔仔的。灰塵撲到他的鼻管裏，眼睛裏。他發作了一陣咳嗆。他的筋脈起楞了。他變成了老是半醒不醒的一個人，什麼事情都差不多像在夢裏一般。瑪利也變樣了。她屁股腫起來。她眼睛旁邊起了深深的黑圈兒，她形容憔悴，臉孔紅腫，看去好像一個乏極了的妓女。她起勁地　着脂抺着粉，她的臉孔便變成漫畫　的舞女的一副鬼相了。</p>
<p>起初時候，多半是因了他的口吻和希臘人的派頭，太克司做着許多笑話的話柄，幾次三番，人家問他，怎麼不在菜館裏跑堂，給客人端出一客牛肉包子來。他得了「堂倌」「水　店倌」「蘇格拉底」和「牛肉包子」這些綽號。漸漸兒，這種綽號呌得太久，惹不起他的氣來。跳舞使他的身心落到習慣的憂愁，和痛楚裏了。他和別的一切競賽者老是想望着吸些新鮮的空氣，他們在休息的時間，如果還不至於疲倦到不會動罷，他們就像夢遊人似的拖步到小床上靠一會兒，否則就進湫　的更衣間或是不淸潔的厠室，從窓口伸口頭去，吸些新鮮空氣，向下望望街上自由自在地走着的不夜乏的人們。</p>
<p>一天復一天的　過去。有時太克司·瑪利或是別的競賽者神昏顛倒的經過了六小時，十二小時，一整天，或者還不止這麼久。過了這時候，億們轉到粗暴的，掙扎著的興奮狀態，過了這興奮狀態，他們又神昏顛倒了。尤其當深更時候，他們如果醒着，往往粗暴起來，掙扎着，咀咒着。性慾也成了逐漸伸張的魔力，有時簡直是發狂了。彼此這麼親近着，他們的身子這麼常常接觸着，他們就愈加淫蕩地調戲着。熬苦和慾望在他們內中熾盛起來。這變成了精神上和肉體上一連串慘烈的痛苦。像是便秘，瀉痢，以及腎　機能突然的失常，這才時刻有一個競賽者在地板上轉着走，或是睡限朦朧的被拖着走的當兒，他們的褲子上或是舞女們穿慣的大脚褲上流下濕淋淋的一行行來。還有，出血，脚上起青盤。還有頭痛，眼病，喉痛，發熱發冷。一陣一陣的出汗，接着是發抖，打寒噤。這一來，常常回到了昏迷，昏迷的原因是失眠和疲勞，是種種的夢想和幻想，這些是他們在地板上團團轉的時候，用以解救熬苦的過程的。這過程的結局就是錢，是成名的機會，是性慾，是潔白的被單，和軟綿綿的舒適的牀舖。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>貧窮的中國</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>素以地大特博民衆自誇的中國，現在竟是一個一貧如洗的破醫囑戶。我們這個破醫囑戶究竟有多少財富，自來沒有確烊調查過，不甚明瞭。但依據日人的統計，我國和列强之國富的比較，有如下表：</p>
<p>國別　國富總額（日金）　每人平均富力（日金）</p>
<p>美國　七六二·二五六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　六·六〇七</p>
<p>英國　二三六·三二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　五·二四七</p>
<p>法國　一〇三·五三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　二·五四九</p>
<p>日本　一〇二·三四三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　一·七三一</p>
<p>德國　七一·流八五〇〇〇·〇〇〇　一·四四一</p>
<p>意國　四四·七八六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　一·一一七</p>
<p>中國　三八·二八九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　·一〇一</p>
<p>日人這個統計，究竟用什麼方法未調查？統計表上的數字，又是否可靠？這可不知道。要是日入這個統計是正確可靠，那末從道個統計表上，我們可以看出中國人的窮，實在窮得可以。我國和列强富力程度相差之大，眞大得驚人。就國富總額說，我國較美國，相差約二十倍，卽較日本，相差亦將近三倍。就每人平均富力說，我國較美國，相差六十倍以上，卽較日本，相差亦有十餘倍。當然，美國是世界首屈一指的富國，我們怎麼比得及她？但我們豈僅比不及美國，卽連日本、我們也和她相差甚遠。而且在這七個國家之中，我國算是最窮的一個。這不能不使人驚心怵目，對國家的經濟前途，抱無窮的隱憂。</p>
<p>中國的窮，大概有二個原因。一個原因，是列强的經齊侵咯。我國自雅片戰役之後，國家的重要門戶，給外人用大砲炸開了。跟着太砲而來。，儘是各國貨物的源源侵入。這結果，造成了中國鉅大的入超，每年向外流溢幾萬萬的金錢。致中國財富，日漸枯竭。另一個原因，就是富源尙未開發。我國全國各地，富源甚豐。這種富源，因交通資本技術等關係，至今尙無法開發，以供人用。這也是中國未能富强的由來。</p>
<p>爲今之計，要救濟中國經濟的困難，一方面應從振興實業，抵制外國經濟侵略着手。他方面又須及早設法開發富源。‘蔣委員長近日繼新生活運動之後，又提倡了一個國民經濟建設運動。這個運動的目的，是想使中國國計民生，能達到安定的地步。這個運動若得普遍實行，對於中國的經濟前途，裨益必定不少。</p>

<p>江面是給落日底餘暉映托得非常美麗，縱然那揚着白帆的紫色小艇去遠了！但是，那對面江岸傍的翠峰綠樹，嫵媚的古寺塔影，以及迎着柔嫩的江風的船家女底淺笑，是賦予這條黃昏的江上以無限的　致。</p>
<p>然而，落日畢竟落下去了！黃昏的江上，只是瀰漫着蒼茫的暮色：輕漾起操舟的年靑郎底小曲底歌唱！</p>
<p>「開船哪！」我們底烏篷船底主人，在船頭上扯開喉嚨高喊，以便客人早點進船。其實船艙里已經擠滿了人，所以船也就立刻離開江岸。</p>
<p>船是平安地輕鬆地在江面上滑着前進，這是暮春的江風在推行着。這隻小舟的旅稈，以時間計算，是只有一個夜晚。而以長度計算，那末是三十哩罷！當旅客們在船艙板土睡了一夜，却被櫓聲槳聲喚醒的時候，太陽剛剛有半個是露在江面上了、，而我們底烏篷船，也已平安地到達牠底目的地了。</p>
<p>暮春時節，日間往往有點膩熱；一到夜裏，尤其是江上，雖然身上著了祫衫，也覺得凉爽輕快。艙中擠看十四個人，所以很是囂喧，而當亮月直照江心，銀光灑進艙中旅客的臉上的時候，他們會搓一搓倦乏的眼說道：</p>
<p>「夜深了呢！」</p>
<p>於是便一個個地躺下去，不久以後，他們都已酣暢地享受着睡眠底愉樂了！而我呢！我是常常失眠，卽使不是在旅途中：由是我輕輕的自語道：</p>
<p>「沒有旅愁的旅客，是幸福的。」</p>
<p>伏在船舷上，聽船底水聲潑刺，很是淸脆：假使我底襟懷風雅一些，也許我是會「扣舷而歌」的，可惜我蠢如鹿豕，只好望望錢塘江底月夜幽景了！</p>
<p>一片靑碧的天，正中鑲着一顆圓月，這或是太寂寞了，沒有一朶雲陪伴着。江面均勻地生起微波，永遠是等速率地。四野靜極，有時有一二白羽水烏，拍翅擦船蓬而去，留下了一句凄抑的長鳴，震顫了旅人底脆弱的心。月兒送着我們底船過了白鷺潭。在那裏，村雞底半夜啼，已聲聲傳來；村子里，似乎有人提着燈籠夜行，而這時，半山腰上，也似乎有二三點燈光，這大約是燐火了吧！</p>
<p>艙擦過一叢蘆葦，投宿在蘆葦里的一羣野鶩，却都　飛起來，驚慌地亂竄着。其中有一隻怕是睡眼惺忪的綠故，却闖進艙來，但牠立刻覺察到這不是牠底歸宿處，而飛去了；可是牠已離羣太遠了呢！</p>
<p>夜凉侵骨，露　祫衣，我相信明天底早晨是近了，於是我準備在夢裏，度過一段未盡的小小旅程，平安地到了我底家。</p>
<h3>沒有父母的兒子</h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>「蠻種」，是我小時候在一道玩要的小朋友，也是我家鄰居的李營長的兒子。</p>
<p>他的性格很粗暴，從小就是一個極頑皮的，在我們小孩子的一羣中，他的年齡雖算是最小，可是他却做了我們一羣的領袖。他有很大的力氣，最會打架，所以逢到與他人打架角鬥的時候，他總是走在最前面妳。他往往打別的小孩子，是非弄得那被打者哭起來，他是不會住手的。他打人之後，他會獰笑起來，就是遇到敵不過的人，他也不會屈服的。因此在鄰近一帶的小孩子們都怕一他，大家給他起一個外號「蠻種。」漸漸地，連大人們也呌他「蠻種」了，他本來的名字，幾乎是誰都忘記了。</p>
<p>他父親是一個軍人，那種兇狠的舉動性格，是在他的對待兒子和老婆的行爲上可以看得出的。他往往因爲一點小事情或者吃多了一點酒，就會把兒子或老婆打得鄰近的人都知道。像他父親這樣的性格，是完全的傳給「蠻種」，而且比他父親還要厲害些。</p>
<p>他母親是在生他後就自殺死了。現在的母親，是他父親再娶的一個妓女出身的，因爲他父親是一個軍人，每年在家的日子並不多，他的妓女出身的年靑的母親，雖然已經是三十歲左右，但因她是過慣着那燈紅酒綠的生活，所以在鄰近的人，都知她是養着漢子的。這件事「蠻種」也知了一點，因此那　漢子的母親也就對他不大管束了。爲了這樣，使這生性頑皮的孩子，更是放蕩，使他十足的成爲一個毫無教養的野孩子。</p>
<p>我們小孩子們呌　蠻種，」都因他是一個野蠻些的人，可是大人們呌他這個別號、却是有着其他的原因的。我常常聽見有人問他：</p>
<p>「你母親是怎樣死的。是誰養你的？」</p>
<p>當着人家問他這話時，他會呆住口的不知所答，他只有高聲的回答人家：</p>
<p>「死就是死，問我父親去吧！他媽的。」</p>
<p>他說話的足句總是要駡人的，尤其是問到他不能回答的話，他會滿口的駡人家的父母祖宗的·</p>
<p>鄰近的女人們也都討厭他，時時會聽到女人們罵他是蠻種，是沒爸爸的野種等等的咒語。</p>
<p>雖然人家是那樣的罵他，他自己却莫明其妙。我們這一班小孩子們也會莫明其妙的。</p>
<p>後來我漸漸地知道了，他母親以前是一個鄉下人的老婆，因爲生得漂亮，就給他父親奪來了。他母親以前的丈夫，也是給他父親殺死的。他也不是他父親生的，而是母親被奪來時，他已經就藏在肚子裏了。</p>
<p>「蠻種」的這叚來歷，他自己一點也不知道。他總以爲他的父親就是他的生身父親。雖然他很野蠻，見了他父親也就有點怕的。</p>
<p>到了他十五六歲時，他也算考進中學讀書了。他漸漸地有了做人的感覺但他却不幸的知道了他自己的身世，而且是比旁人知道得更情楚。在中學才讀了二年，他突然的失踪了。他父親四處的找尋，結果還是不知他到什麼地方去。他在給他父親的信上寫着：「……我是一個孤兒，我的父母都是給你殺害的，假如你不是養我這十幾年，我是要把你殺死而慰我的親生父母的……」</p>
<h3>韓江舟子</h3>
<p>— 溟濛</p>
<p>韓江的舟子載了火炭和木柴等物，從遠遠的韓江上流漂泛下來。經過了險灘，衝過了急流，生活在有力的肩臂之下，一直到函孔哂成了焦黑，而　上支撑了長長的木槳，結成了疤。待到了湘子橋下，才能够稍稍透一口氣。然後從汕島又載上了另一種貨物，又要逆流而上，爬險灘，衝急流，直衝進羣山包圍的地方去。生活眞是一種重負呀！</p>
<p>每當水漲，湘子橋畔的洪水捲起了巨大的旋渦，橋柱被浸上了水波。一個不留神，舟子會碰成粉碎。水落的時候，河流的某一段會個得見着水底的赤沙，一載貨物的重壓把船駕在積沙的上面。如果沒有人來帮忙，藉着人力踏進水里去推着船身，船兒簡直不肯前進一步。從兩山夾着的水道上前進，一個不留，心，木船更會給灘石撃成碎片。</p>
<p>然而我們的韓江舟子有的是堅强的體魄，富於臂力的臂腕，和長滿着全身的奮鬥精神。把生命的精力同自然搏鬥，和水流掙扎，讓生命在這天地間繼續生存，在韓江的浩流上遺下了人間的偉績。</p>
<p>我們的韓江舟子也樂天知命：在船上橪起了炊煙，吃飽了飯，生命的偉力便自然流露：工作時便哼起了山歌·忘記了痛苦。韓江的洪流上常常吹滿了歌聲，韓江入口處的海潮響應着人間的呼呌。</p>
<p>每當月夜，在韓紅的堤岸上踏着自已的身影。看着灰白色的月光照着一派洪水。偉江的舟子閃出微弱的火光，船夫把歌聲在空氣裏激盪，傳播到兩岸上面。如果趕着流水，舟子會在夜間還撑着不　，激出全身精力，流出遍身大汗</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，把一個個的黑影盪漾在水波上面。自然的美景與我們的船夫是無綠，生活隔絕着人間的這個階級。</p>
<p>或有把舟子停在岸傍的，從一道稅關附近的酒店裏沽到了幾兩滲雜着火酒的下等高梁，在濁流上勉强買醉，以忘記一日的痛苦。這情形是痛苦抑或快樂，我們的船夫自已恐怕也不能够解釋。</p>
<p>韓江的洪流上也漂着竹排或木筏。在一排徘的木筏上，搭上臨時的居處。逢着水漲時，木筏固然奔流得像流矢股快，那情形比笨重的木船自然來得容易駕駛。但是在預防橋柱和險灘上，長長的木筏便顯得難於迅捷週轉。更可憐的是如果遇着水涸，那駕駛便顯得異常地吃力。</p>
<p>韓江的舟子有一種特殊的形式，把船首逐漸修尖，翹起得像端陽競賽的龍舟。給一個初看者似乎覺得很有興味，然而我們的舟子在爬上險灘時，這種形式也只能給他們一種便利，以避免急水冲進舟中，此外在他們却完全不會感到一點興味。</p>
<p>把一世的生涯都消麼在水上，磨着筋肉吃飯。現在歐洲的文明却挾着巨大的機器力衝入內地，汽船也來在江中橫行。我們的舟子已經感到生活的威脅，一想到有一天物質文明更加發達，則我們的舟子將在什麼地方再找到噉飯處。</p>
<p>可憐的偉江舟子呵！中國舟子的命運！</p>
<h3>華洋職業介紹所</h3>
<p>— 天眞</p>
<p>「沒有職業，肚子餓癟；朋友借錢，有口難說；哈個辦法？—生路已絕！」</p>
<p>那是一個年輕的小夥子，不長不矮，縐起眉毛，小聲兒這樣唱。兩隻脚走來走去、好像有很大的心事、屋子又小，許多人都把眼睛望着他、笑他、像瘋子。儘管外國人噓他、他也像沒聽見呢！</p>
<p>「還有外國人嗎？—外國人不是都有錢的嗎？」尤小妹因爲在鄉下看見的外國人，全神氣十足，滿有錢似的。</p>
<p>（劉大嫂把椅子移近尤小妹，像母親教訓女兒那模樣。）</p>
<p>這是華洋職業介紹所啦！外國人沒有窮人？羅宋癟三不曉得有多少：老太婆，老頭子。中國人也不少呢！</p>
<p>「假如沒有那多外國人，我們找事就容易了。」初來的尤小妹，上海有着滿地的黃金在她眼前輝耀着，可是經劉大嫂這末一說，她的心上給潑了一盆冷水，十分焦思地轉而增恨失業的外國人。</p>
<p>容易？也不見得。第一要懂外國話，第二要年紀輕，人長得漂亮，他們才要。還有，你要做外國人家的事，疙瘩得很！眞是。</p>
<p>在鄉下，劉大嫂是住在尤小妹的隔壁的，尤小妹這次來上海，自然十分相信她的話，而且她是「老上海」，一切全靠着她指示：「聽說有些會說中國話，—你不是會講外國話嗎？」</p>
<p>懂得，自然好哪！像我，一聽不淸整便吃排頭，歇事，—你不知道，去年一年，我換了三個東家。外國人眞疙瘩，錢子用多了哪，再不然，說你偷去了，可是衣服却要兩天一換：小菜呢，輪到我們，就只有冷湯和骨頭啃了，如果預先留下一點菜，給他瞧見了便要鬧翻天地；尤其是來了個把客，他總是不放心，怕吃他的飯，來一趟客，總得捱一次駡。我勸你，還是做中國人家的好。</p>
<p>「聽說外國人家肯出錢。」尤小妹的本意，因爲外國人的錢多，所以纔從鄉下跑出來；實在原來的種菜生活，尙勉强可够溫飽。但年紀要輕，人要漂亮，做什麼，他有點不懂：「要漂亮做什麼？，能做事，不聾不啞就是啦。』</p>
<p>漂亮，就是要漂亮，外國人不是好東西，狗屁打糟的！</p>
<p>不知是否從窗裏射進來的太陽的炎熱，還是劉大嫂的心裏有點慚愧，快上四十歲的劉大嫂驗上，頓時浮上靑春的一顆紅量，她把椅子移開尤小妹一些，尤小妹儘瞧着她又思索一會，彷彿有些明白：「沒有太太嗎？如果不規矩的話，怎麼不告訴太太？」</p>
<p>告訴太太？他們講些什麼話，你又不懂，結果只是自己吃虧，不是捱駡捱打，便是歇事！去年換三個東家的緣故，一半是不懂話，一半是……</p>
<p>「還要打嗎？那麼你在這里做了多久呢？」</p>
<p>六個號頭了。……不打？打了哭都不許哭。</p>
<p>他在這里能够做到六個月之久，尤小妹是知道一切了。想到要漂亮，尤小妹從窗門玻璃上的反光裏看見自己的臉上幾粒黑麻子，似乎牽了藤？再看上了年紀的劉大嫂，頭髮光光的，衣服也很整潔，比起自己來還要漂亮得多。於是她更加失望了。</p>
<p>（沉默鎖住灶披間，爐上的水哇哇地呌。劉大嫂起身揭開水壺蓋）</p>
<p>（樓梯軋軋響，一會，棄棄地走出一個外國男子，嬉皮笑臉地瞧着劉大嫂，一發現坐在門角裏的尤小妹，便板着面孔了。）</p>
<p>「她是誰？在這里幹什麼！……滾出去！」</p>
<p>尤小妹瞧見劉大嫂只是瑟縮地，說不出話來，她忙地貶了劉大嫂一眼，便走出後門。門碰然一響、屋子裏立刻起了唧唧的笑聲。</p>

<p>開篇「埋玉」</p>
<p>胡兒造反范陽城。驟趕干戈到處驚。文武一朝臣齊護駕。御林統領六軍行。將軍押隊陳元禮。四壁刀槍鼓噪聲。楊國忠誤國先誅戳。不斬楊妃不進兵。可憐天子渾無主。無可如何割舊情。陳元禮。負朕恩。枉爲極品大將軍。不知職守因何事。只管富人不管兵。一幅香羅羅賜死。香消玉碎片時辰。佳人斷送梨花貌。孤負當年七夕盟。長生殿裏拜雙星。今生夫婦難偕老。來世夫妻未必眞。一種痴情難以遣。返魂香怎得返香魂。旨酒一盃香一炷。望空揮淚奠佳人。每到無聊哭出聲。天子常愁妃子恨。年來花月盡無心。贏得人間薄倖名。</p>

<h3>每一個明星都有一個對性中的模倣者</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>這是好萊塢最近的發現：每一個明星，在他或她的對性之中，一定啊一個對等的替身的。</p>
<p>他們，這些對等的男女明星，非但在形貌上相像，年齡相若，並且在職業生活，以及私人生活上，沒有一處不相同的。他們早年的環境。過去的歷史以至於他們的性情，羅曼斯，結婚的次數等等，都一類同。這豈不是好萊塢最可驚的新發現嗎？</p>
<p>好萊塢有了男的克拉克蓋博，還要有女的克拉克蓋博；有了女的凱茀蘭茜絲，還要有男的凱茀蘭茜絲，據說好萊塢沒有一個電影明星，在對性之中，沒有一個對等的模倣者的，就是人所認爲獨一無二的葛萊泰嘉寳，亦一個男的對象。發明這件事的那位新聞記者，特爲比事選擇了八個女明星，八個男明星，將他們兩兩配合起來，証明了他奇怪的發現。</p>
<p>他第一個所提到的，就是克拉克蓋博和俄籍女明星安娜史丹。倘使你將他們二人的面部側形，並立在一起，那你就可以看得出，除去了克拉克蓋博所應有的頭髮，眉毛和小鬍子之外，其餘的眼，鼻，口等等，都是相彷彿的。他們非但形貌相同，他們早年的遭遇，亦是大同小異的。一個在沃海渥的農村中，一個在俄國的小地方，同樣的受盡了幼小時候的慶折。他們同一時候開始學戲。同樣的嫁娶了一個於他們前途有大造化，而不能快樂同居的人。一個是嫁了一位俄國的大演員，一個是娶了一位有名的戲劇指導員。他們同在一九二八年中，在兩個地方離了婚。</p>
<p>後來他們同樣的嫁娶了年齡比自己大的人。同樣的以堅强不屈的作風成名了。他們的性情亦是相同的。他們都是喜歡戶外生活，接近大自然。都有健碩的體格。他們都喜歡平凡，而都沒有什麼異國情調的。最後，他們的皮色和談話的聲音，都是很相同的。</p>
<p>葛萊泰嘉寳和龍那柯爾門，是銀幕上一對憤世嫉俗的演員。你倘使將他們二人的相片並列著，就可以看出他們有可驚的類似之點。他們同樣的顯露著對於人世閱歷之深。當然，他們的閱歷是經過了同樣不得意的戀愛得來的。一個是由於和茂立資史蒂勒愛情之破裂，一個是由於在英倫婚姻的失敗。他們都有令人不可迫近的態度。晨近他們各自購置了房產，準備退休。很奇怪的，在十九個月之前，他們同時脫離了好萊塢，各自回到自己的家鄉，而他們回到好萊塢來繼續工作，日期的相差，亦不過十天。同樣的，他們回來的時候，祗肯拍兩張片子。</p>
<p>愛琳鄧和約翰巴爾斯二人的事蹟，再相像沒有了。他捫同是三十出頭的人，同生在本薛文尼亞的南部，同出身於平常人家。他們同時學著歌舞，同樣有很好的歌喉，但是他們的歌喉，同樣不爲製作家所重，而被派了劇劇中的中等角色。差不多同時進入影界。</p>
<p>他們的經歷，雖然十分相同，但是他們直到合演“BackStreet”的時候，才互相認識起來。他們二人，每人結過一次婚，而直到如今，在他們各別的家庭之中，從來沒有聽見過離異約風聲。他們的嗜好，都是喜歡書籍和音樂。他們的口味相同。愛琳鄧是好萊塢著名的烹飪家，但是奇之又奇的是，約翰巴爾斯亦是一位有名的庖師！</p>
<p>華雷斯皮萊和巳故的曼麗特蘭漱的形貌，作風等等，可以說是再相像沒有了。他們相像得，無庸再去將他們比擬了。他們的成名，都在他們身體發胖，年齡過了四十以後。都是從滑稽輕角，而成爲重頭戲的老角色。簡而言之，他們無處不相像。若以形貌而論，你將曼麗改了男裝，就是一位華雷；你將華雷改了女裝，就是一位曼麗。他們的慈祥的性格，樂善好施的行爲，亦是同樣爲人所稱道的。</p>
<p>其餘幾位相似的男女明星，在這這裏亦不能細述，但提起他們的名字巳足，一對是巴白蘭拉瑪和魯道爾夫范侖鐵諾。他們是同時生，同的死的。一對是梅琪伊文斯和斐列潑斯賀姆斯。一對是詹姆斯賈南和瓊勃郎黛兒。還有一對是威廉鮑惠爾和凱茀蘭茜斯。請讀者自己去注意他們植種相像的地方吧。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「風流皇帝」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>All　The　King’s　Horses</p>
<p>—大光明映—</p>
<p>一般歌舞的影片製作者，老是喜歡把他們片中的主要角色派作國王，封君等貴族，把背景弄在宮闈，別墅，以及堡寨中的原因，决不是偶然的。主要的是被决定於爵土曲等華靡音調的玩弄者及其所侍奉之對象的身份，他們全是有錢有閑階級，所以這類影片的製作者爲投其所好，調合口味，達到自己生意眼的目的計，便少有例外的選擇了皇帝，公爵這類人物來作劇中的主角。而跟着來的背景自然是他們起居飲食遊樂的所在地了。同時因着這類影片的由於虛搆與不高明的說謊，內容往往空虛得一無所有，於是不得不以華麗的背景，炫奇的道具來希望略事掩飾，或淆亂人們的注意，因此，富有與顯貴者的宮室是最適合這一要求地被採用，而跟着來的人物也就是牠的主人貴族們了。至於皇帝必風流，后妃必多情，這類特定個性，自然爲了便於他們編造無稱之談的故事之進行，合於風流自賞，多情自居的有錢有閒者的胃口而已。</p>
<p>「風流皇帝」就是上述的最好的說明。</p>
<p>說是有個國王羅道夫其人者一則因忙於朝政，以致無暇享受宮中的樂趣，二則爲遵照國王必須蓄鬚的慣例，弄得於思於思地不便輕吻膩狎。因此，皇后愛琳負氣地住到避暑宮去經年不回。於是皇帝急了，向一個獲得無數少女愛戀的漂亮小生，電影明星卡勞求敎，如何可以使得皇后回心轉意的方法。結果是剃去鬍鬚，把皇位讓給卡勞代理，自己往維也納去遊樂，和一個呌米米的女子大做其愛的把戲。</p>
<p>而這位面貌和羅道夫相像的卡勞假皇帝，却在國會中，和後宮裏鬧出許多笑話。皇后聽到皇帝已經剃了鬍子的消息，當夜趕回宮來，向假皇帝恢復了眞愛情來，戲就在這樣的展了開去。說是卡勞爲了尊重皇帝的令譽，用種種方法避免了「那個」，倒成全與復原了帝后間的舊好。</p>
<p>這樣虛構的故事，在編劇上更沒有什麼過人之處。電影明星的突然充做國王，居然連到皇后也認識不出，這說謊的不够技術，眞是破了從前所有的紀錄了。卡勞和皇后酣舞的中途忽然換了羅道夫，她竟會不覺得，又如國王忙得沒有功夫伴一下皇后，倒可以奏着琴來伴卡勞歌唱這矛盾，也是够可笑的了。</p>
<p>從演出方而來看看吧，這兒導演FrankTuttle倒是相當用心而獲得了相當成果的。首先要說的是剪接的簡潔與調子的明快。幾個化鏡頭的活潑，更是可取。第二是能在小動作上作力有的戲，如首先寫皇后的深宮寂寞，用翻弄書，撫摸狗，以及背着燈光在墻上做影子來消遣的戲，只寫她手的動作，就可說明了她的心境。聽見打門就急忙盛飾着以爲是皇帝來了的神情，以及避暑宮中擎塑像獨舞時的惆悵等都很好地說明她內在的幽情，以開展此後臨窗高歌，亭畔酣舞的熱烈情調。</p>
<p>幾個歌的唱奏，也和別的這類片子沒有多少不同的好處。</p>
<p>講到演技卡爾勃烈蓀是演着國王與明是兩個角色的，可是在這不是講究與刻劃個性的戲中兩方面都只是演來平平而已，比較地還是曼麗愛立絲的皇后演來深刻與週到一些。</p>
<p>醫術科學巨片「　死關頭」中吉士馬立斯及薇姬妮勃羅絲之表演南京今日四映</p>
<h3>科學驚人大發明脊骨麻醉法</h3>
<p>醫術外科方面最複雜而危險的事蹟，要推手術之實施了。因爲病人之生與死，全懸於主割者之手。時間的迫促，空間的緊張，心和力的最高表演，恐怕在這種宣演無餘。所以醫師們剖析纖微，競毫釐之差，以與時，空，死神搏鬥，而奪回人類至寳至貴的性命，確非具有鋼一般堅强的手腕，光一般敏速的腦精不可。所謂百萬國手（MillionDollarHsnds）之難，於此可以概見了。可是現由「南京」公映之古士馬立斯主演的「生死關頭」，他不特救護了許多生機，他還親自指揮手術，竟把自己之洞腹穿胸，不治之症治痊了。所用脊骨麻醉法（SpinalAnae3thetic）以及醫界敗類之之腐敗內容，都値得社會人士非常之注意的。尤其素以强有力個性表演著名之大明星，吉士馬立斯，自「水落石出」以來，這是他生平最得意之作。女主角薇姬尼勃露絲（VirginiaBruce）（按薇姬尼係約翰吉爾勃JoanGilbert之妻，結婚後息影銀壇已久。此次作東山之再起，曾在「賣野人頭」飾歌女，而仍獲影迷推許者，是母庸曉曉介紹的</p>
<h3>多才多藝的卡爾勃烈蓀的新片</h3>
<p>— 曼曼</p>
<p>卡爾勃烈蓀，本是歐洲劇壞上一位最紅的歌星。前給派拉蒙公司羅致到好萊塢去，主演了「歌杉血痕」一片。問世以後，竟博得千萬影迷的熱烈歡迎，尤其是片中的「合歡杯」CocktailsForTwo一曲，至今還在美國流行着。</p>
<p>勃烈蓀態度溫文儒雅，和羅門諾伐羅等，好像是一個典型的人才，也就是我們所稱的「風流小生」，誰能相信他還是一位鬥拳家呢？但是，實在說起來，他對於拳術，確有研究。他在歌洲，雖然沒有正式和人擺過擂台，但是他只擅於拳術的聲名，並不比他的歌星聲譽來得小。德國太子威廉，曾經跟他學習拳術。他到了好萊塢以後，無論拍戲忙得怎樣，每天他至少總得和他帶來的拳師，來上一兩個回合，他眞可是算得是鬥拳界裏的忠實信徒了。</p>
<p>最近他在倫敦，主演了一部名呌「TwoHeartinTheWatzTime」的歌舞片。這部片子，將來是否要運到中國來開映，祗好等到將來再來報吿諸君了。</p>
<h3>又一文藝電影迭更斯絕筆「沉冤」</h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>這個年頭兒，文藝電影眞是盛極一時了。在最近一個月中，單就上海方面，巳映過不少文藝影片。英國十九世紀大文豪却爾迭更斯（CharlesDickens）的「塊肉餘生」，不久之前，在南京大戲院和我們相見，但迭更斯的「沉寃」TheMysteryofEdwinDrood，又被環球攝成影片而將在大上海和我們見面了。</p>
<p>却爾迭更斯（1812-1870）是英國的名小說家早年時代，他的身世很苦，全憑個人的力量，磨練成一個著名的作家。就爲了這個原因，他所寫的東西，也以寫他自身經過的事件爲多，以長於描寫中下流社會而著名。畢生所寫的作品很多，最近爲好萊塢影片公司搬上銀幕的，也已不少了。</p>
<p>「沉冤」便是他在一八七〇年最後所寫的一部小說，可是不幸得很，這部作品未寫完之前，他便逝世了。故事的取材，描寫一個牧師，他在社會方面很得人信仰，可見他的私生活却犯上了抽烟的惡習。他有一個侄子，在耶誕之前，某一天的晚上，暴風雨中，忽告失蹤了。但大家知道這個青年的失蹤，是為他情敵所暗殺，等到弄清這頭秘密案，已費去不少麻煩。雖然是一張偵探性質的影片，但這裏也　入不少笑料呢！</p>
<p>演員方面，由主演「戰地離魂」的克勞特雷斯Claude　Rains主演，為了這故事很適合於雷斯，所以表演方面使他能夠充分的把天才發揮出來。雷斯主演「戰地離魂」之後，美國的電影觀衆，都說他有獲得一九三四年電影藝術科學院褒獎的可能，結果他雖落選，但近年來他的藝術正在猛進之中，是我們所不能否認的。</p>

<h3>雲天恨塞（Living　on　Velvet）（六）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>愛梅看了不覺奇怪起來，想問脫雷在做什麼。脫雷槍着說道：「我想造一間飛機貯藏所。我要做生意了。愛梅道：「你要做什麼？」脫雷又說道：「我要做生意。你聽我說。我想買一只飛機……水上飛機，我可以載着這裏鄉居的人，來往於城鄉之間……停泊在河裏，就在垣街的口上。他們坐火車，要費一個半鐘頭，但是他們坐在飛機裏，祗要十五分鐘就够了。這是穩賺錢的。當然，第一年恐怕要賠些錢。不過將來是穩賺錢的……再則，我又可以到天空中去了！」</p>
<p>愛梅道：「脫雷，那只飛機……要多少錢？」脫雷從衣袋中抽了一支鉛筆，檢起了一個舊信封，就開始計算起來。他說道：「當然……費用不止一只飛機的價錢……我還要多賃一方地……將它填平了……蓄起一所貯藏室……工人……器具……此外還有你的飛機塲管理員的薪水等等……我希望你亦要原諒些，不能薪水太大了。」</p>
<p>他說着，抬起頭來看看愛梅，可是愛梅默然一言不發，好似不贊成的樣子。於是脫雷又繼續下去道：「這樣計算下來，總數是一萬零一百七十一塊六角七分。別這樣愣着，愛梅。我們付完了賬，買完了東西，還有八千塊……我們想法子，再弄兩千塊就够了……那亦不是什麼難事呀……」</p>
<p>他果然蓋了一所飛機貯贜室，購置了一只飛機，在一個晴天的下午，愛梅將一瓶火柿子醬替它行了一個命名典禮。在這樣簡單得可憐的典禮行完了之後，脫雷就自已跨上了飛機，要和愛梅到天空中夫巡遊一下，但是愛　卻拒絕了。</p>
<p>「我一個人去了，」脫軒說。「我一回兒就下來的……大概十分錡就够了。」在他的臉上表示著心急的樣子，急急科要想我和天空較高下。那已經成了他的天性了。愛梅無法，祗好答應了他一聲：「你去吧。」</p>
<p>脫雷一個人在天空中試飛了一回，就下來了。可是他回到家裏的時候，他看見愛梅穿着一身出門的衣服，坐在一只大皮包上。他站住了，看着她，問她做什麼？愛梅很簡單的道：「我要離開你了。」脫雷道：「脫下那身衣服，現在該預備晚飯了。」他勉强地裝着笑容，可是愛梅一本正經的道：「在我沒有走之前，我要和你說一句話。你那種對待生命，對待世界的態度，實在太難了。我知道你生活上，有一個空虛，一個很顯著而可怖的空虛。當我嫁給你的時候，我以為可以填滿那個空虛的……但是我沒有。我已經不配做你的妻了。」</p>
<p>脫雷徵微搖著頭道：「你真會說話，不過……你不能走的。你……你不能剝奪我的生命的。我想你是很好的妻子……實實在在的。」愛梅的眼中，充滿了眼淚。她說道「我本想能够帮你的忙的，但是我卻沒有法子幫你的忙……唉，脫雷……我因爲愛你太深的原故……我不能不離你而去了。「脫雷哀求著道：「你恨我好了，但求你不要走。你聽我的話，愛梅……我愛你……我愛你……一（未完）</p>

At 9 a.m., they visited Secretary-General Ye at the Central Party Headquarters, where they were received by Ye in the Third Conference Hall. Fine Longjing tea and domestic cigars were served. Ye also presented several of the most valuable calligraphy pieces of Dr. Sun Yat-sen for their perusal. After being seated, Ye delivered a welcoming address, followed by a response from Mr. Forbes, the head of the mission, which was translated by Jiang Kangli, the head of the International Section. After about an hour, they took their leave. Before departing, they presented over ten copies of the English version of the Three Principles of the People to each member of the mission as a memento. At 10:30 a.m., they visited Mayor Ma at the City Government, where they were received by Ma in the reception room. After a conversation of about half an hour, they took their leave. Forbes expressed great admiration for all the construction projects in Nanjing. At 11 a.m., they visited the Ministry of Railways, where they were received by Acting Minister Zeng in the reception room on the third floor.

<p>(Nanjing) Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaojun hosted a luncheon for the U.S. Economic Mission at the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center at 1 p.m. on the 25th. More than ten people attended, including mission head Forbes, U.S. Ambassador Johnson and his counselors and secretaries, Secretary-General of the Economic Commission Qin Fen, Vice Minister Zhang Daofan, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cao Gexian, and directors from various ministries such as Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Finance, and Communications. Mayor Ma and his wife, Secretary-General Wang Shufang and his wife, and various bureau chiefs, counselors, and secretaries were present to receive the guests. More than seventy people attended in total. Mayor Ma delivered a speech, stating that China and the United States were two great nations on the east and west sides of the Pacific, with long-standing friendly relations and close economic ties. He said that the mission's visit to China to promote business between the two countries and to exchange views with Chinese business leaders to gain a better understanding and cooperation was welcomed by the Chinese people. He hoped that the mission would develop concrete plans based on their findings for practical implementation, which was of particular importance to the Chinese people. He mentioned that Nanjing was China's new capital and the location of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum. While many construction projects had not yet been completed, ambitious plans were actively being implemented. He extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the citizens and wished them a successful trip. Forbes responded, saying that the mission was honored to be invited by the mayor and deeply appreciated the hospitality. He noted that Nanjing, as China's new capital, was making rapid progress in various construction projects, and that the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen was admired worldwide. Nanjing was also the location of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum, so the mission had come to both observe the construction of China's new capital and pay their respects to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to the mayor for the hospitality and hoped that the friendly relations between China and the United States would grow stronger and that the economies of the two countries would prosper. During the luncheon, the guests and hosts exchanged views on the national conditions of the two countries in a very pleasant atmosphere.

A giant Douglas airplane from the China National Aviation Corporation was already parked at the airfield, ready for use. Upon arriving at the airfield, the mission members thanked the representatives and bid farewell to the U.S. Ambassador. The airfield workers finished loading the mission members' luggage. The entire mission, consisting of nine members (because Mr. and Mrs. Heller and their female secretary, Valance, had already returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 24th), along with the U.S. Ambassador and all the representatives, took a group photo in front of the plane. They boarded the plane one by one, accompanied by Wang Zhisheng, a representative from the Shanghai Reception Office.

Secretary-General Ye then delivered a welcoming speech, which was translated by Section Chief Jiang Kangli. He stated that he was very honored to have the opportunity to meet with the mission and exchange ideas. He said that the friendly relations between China and the United States had always been excellent, and that the mission's visit to China to conduct economic investigations and seek improvements in Sino-American trade was greatly welcomed by the Chinese government and people. He noted that since the success of the National Revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the comrades of the Nationalist Party had been working hard to carry out various construction projects in accordance with Dr. Sun's teachings. He mentioned that progress had been made in recent years and that the mission would be able to understand the direction of their efforts after their investigations. He emphasized that the United States was advanced in industry, commerce, agriculture, engineering, culture, and education, and that there was much that China could learn from the United States. He added that the mission members were experts in various industries and that their visit to China was admired by the Chinese people. He said that China was in the process of carrying out all kinds of construction and that the results of the mission's investigations would certainly help the Chinese people. He also hoped that the mission's report would provide frank criticism that would be of even greater benefit. He expressed his belief that the mission's visit to China would not only enhance good commercial relations but also deepen the friendship between the people of the two countries. He apologized for any inadequacies in the reception and hoped for their understanding. He then presented them with books on the Three Principles of the People, the National Reconstruction Program, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, as well as several pieces of Dr. Sun's calligraphy, which were highly treasured by the Nationalist Party, for their viewing. Finally, he wished the mission success in achieving the results they hoped for and wished them good health. Mr. Forbes, the head of the mission, responded, saying that the mission was very grateful for the warm reception they had received from all sides since their arrival in China. He expressed his hope that they would achieve the best possible results in order to promote the progress of trade and friendship between the two countries. He stated that the investigation could be divided into two aspects: general and specific. He said that the general aspects might be easy to obtain, but the specific aspects might be difficult to obtain. He expressed his hope that they would not hesitate to provide guidance and materials to assist in their investigation and to find a fundamental way to improve trade relations between the two countries. He thanked the Chinese government leaders for their warm reception and expressed his deep gratitude to Secretary-General Ye for his kindness. Finally, he said that he was very grateful to Secretary-General Ye for presenting them with books on the Three Principles of the People, the National Reconstruction Program, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and for allowing them to view Dr. Sun Yat-sen's precious calligraphy.

<h3>International Shipping Competition and Our Country's Self-Defense</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>International shipping competition is intensifying due to the impact of the global economic downturn, and the Far East has also become a target for major powers to compete for. The US government has agreed to allocate 30 million US dollars to subsidize American company Dollar Line to build new ships and expand Far Eastern shipping. Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kaisha is also rapidly catching up, planning to quickly complete its new plan for 200,000 tons of new-style express ships. Osaka Shosen Kaisha has also resumed the South China route since April, and has also added ships to the Japan-Shanghai line. Other shipping companies from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway are all actively preparing and unwilling to fall behind. This spring, the British Cabinet passed the Shipping Subsidy Act to enable British foreign shipping companies to compete with foreign shipping. German Norddeutscher Lloyd also has a large-scale plan to develop Far Eastern shipping. Italy's Far Eastern Shipping Company, known for its developed business, is also transferring 33,000-ton passenger ships originally operating on the Atlantic route to the Europe-Asia line to strengthen its lineup and compete with Norddeutscher Lloyd. French Shipping Company and Norwegian Bao Lung Company are all urgently seeking to revitalize their businesses in order to cope with the intense competition and open a new record for Far Eastern shipping competition. Foreign ships already have a tendency to dominate in China, and under these circumstances, China's shipping industry will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>China's shipping power is inherently weak, and the reasons for its difficulty in developing are also extremely complex. First, major powers manipulate China's inland and coastal navigation rights through their political power. Second, foreign merchant ships compete with us with their strong capital, complete equipment, fast and stable speeds, and low freight rates. Third, domestic shipping companies fail to cooperate closely. Fourth, the existing ships are old, the equipment is simple, and the speeds are slow. Fifth, the government fails to provide sufficient substantial assistance to the shipping industry. Sixth, frequent natural disasters and wars affect the navigation of ships. With these six factors, coupled with the constraints of donations and taxes and the harassment of bandits, few of China's national shipping industries can avoid misfortune. Therefore, since last year, shipping on all routes has been extremely sluggish. Due to the large number of ships and small amount of cargo on the North China route, freight rates for each ship have fallen competitively, resulting in exhaustion and huge losses. Although business on the Yangtze River route has improved slightly since the completion of water and land transportation since last autumn, Japanese merchant ships have returned strongly and are encroaching day by day, causing a blow to China's shipping industry. Business on the South China routes, such as the Shanghai-Hong Kong, Shanghai-Guangdong, and Guangdong-Guangxi lines, has also been in a state of decline. Furthermore, due to the decline in business, the infighting and struggles between domestic shipping companies are also intensifying. If this continues, the situation is truly worrying.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of this, convened national shipping companies on March 20 last year to discuss proposals to promote the shipping industry. Although there were more than 200 proposals, the most important of which was the case of shipping cooperation. At that time, it was decided that the Ministry of Communications would lead the Shanghai Shipping Association and the state-owned China Merchants Group to jointly form the China Shipping Design Committee to establish a complete shipping policy, so that the fragmented shipping industry would be forced by the needs of the environment to implement sincere unity.</p>
<p>Now, the China Shipping Cooperation Council will be established on May 1, and the cooperation plan has also been approved by the Ministry of Communications. It is reported that the main duties of the council are: (1) to adjust the shipping routes on the river and sea routes; (2) to balance the supply and demand of cargo space based on tonnage and frequency; (3) to realize the unity and cooperation of state-owned and private shipping; (4) to be open and transparent in everything and eliminate the harm of price reductions caused by mutual distrust. If the above-mentioned promises can be implemented one by one, then China's shipping industry, although in the midst of fierce competition, will have a chance to turn around in the future.</p>
<p>Although the fundamental cause of the decline of China's shipping industry does not lie entirely in the mutual fighting between companies, the unequal treaties relied upon by major powers to carry out organized and planned shipping aggression against us also have a great relationship. Therefore, how to recover the navigation rights of foreigners in China is also something that the entire country should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Issues Another Order to Increase Domestic Silver Price to 77.57 Cents per Ounce, Aiming to Protect American Interests, It Is Said That a Major International Reaction Is Gradually Occurring</h3>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt ordered tonight to increase the price paid by the government for domestically mined silver to 77.57 cents per ounce, silver-faction congressmen predicted one after another that the price of silver would soon rise to $1.29, or even exceed this number. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Bankers and silver brokers pointed out that the soaring world silver price was entirely caused by the activities of speculators such as India and the United States. They said that the policies of these countries are actually forcing the US government to raise domestic silver prices, giving speculators an extremely favorable position. It is heard that after the silver price soared to over 60 cents, the US Treasury Department has not purchased silver in the world market. It is estimated that the world's silver that can be immediately cashed is only 50 million ounces. Speculators now have no difficulty in quickly raising the silver price to above the government's newly set price. If you want to stop it, the only way is for the government to announce a temporary suspension of purchase or sale of silver. A major international reaction is gradually occurring. This matter not only has a further tightening effect in China, but also brews a serious situation in Mexico. The silver value of the Mexican currency itself is based on a silver price of 72 cents per ounce, which is equal to the circulating currency value of the Mexican currency. If the world silver price rises again, the Mexican silver coins will all be melted down. If so, the Mexican currency system will be greatly disrupted. If the Mexican government raises the exchange rate of its currency, Mexican trade will be adversely affected, especially trade with the United States. Bankers predict that the Mexican side will also strongly criticize the United States' silver policy, as will those from China. (25th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order this afternoon to increase the price paid by the government for domestically mined silver to 77.57 cents per ounce. This price increase was achieved by reducing the government's coinage tax from 45% to 40%. The president's action was quite sudden, because just a few hours ago, Treasury officials still stated that the government did not intend to raise the silver price again, and that the Treasury Department would give a price according to the world silver price when purchasing domestically mined silver in the New York silver market in the future. According to the president's order, this price increase will be implemented immediately. Beforehand, the Treasury Department suddenly held a meeting, completely reversing the attitude announced a few hours ago. The legal counsel to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also attended the meeting. At that time, it was explained that, according to the London Silver Agreement, the US government must stockpile all of its domestically produced silver for currency purposes. Treasury officials apparently did not pay attention to this regulation in their statement a few hours ago. If the government purchases silver in the New York market, it is feared that the price of speculators will exceed the government price, so that the United States will not be able to fulfill the conditions of the London Agreement, so the president's order had to be issued. According to the government's recently set silver price, it is 71.11 cents per ounce, and the world silver price continues to rise, and this morning the New York market price has exceeded the government price. According to banker news, by this summer, the silver price has a tendency to rise to one dollar per ounce. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today increased the price paid by the Treasury Department for domestically mined silver from 71 cents per ounce to 77.57 cents per ounce. This is the second increase in the domestic silver price this month. The first price increase was on April 10, from 64.5 cents to 71 cents, totaling a strong 13 cents in two weeks. President Roosevelt's order stated that this move was necessary for the sake of American interests. This statement was made in response to the recent surge in world silver prices. The coinage tax was originally levied at 45% of the silver currency price, which is $1.29 per ounce. Now, it is reduced to 40%. The Treasury Department may levy a 50% profit tax on the profits gained from the soaring silver price. This move aims to prevent domestic silver producers from hoarding silver in anticipation of higher government prices and gaining excessive profits. Congressional silver faction congressmen and western mines were extremely excited by the news of this price increase. Silver faction congressmen still predict that the silver price will soon rise to $1.29, because the Treasury Department's silver purchase price has already increased, and the world silver price will also rise accordingly. American silver miners calculated their profits based on the difference between foreign and domestic silver prices, and estimated that they had gained a paper profit of $1,468,250 due to President Roosevelt's actions. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The silver market here today was affected by the soaring US domestic silver price, and prices soared. The spot price is 34 pence 875, an increase of 2 pence 0625, because there are more speculative purchases and fewer sales. Today's silver price reached the highest point since October 30, 1924. Although the recent developments in the United States have excited speculators, gold and silver merchants have criticized the United States' policy. The United States has not recently purchased silver, so the rise in silver prices is entirely due to speculators' manipulation. They will work harder to raise prices in the future. Some say that the real purpose of the United States is not to purchase silver in the world market, but to encourage speculators to raise silver prices in order to appease domestic silver faction congressmen. According to experts, this situation will continue, and speculators will eventually be caught. At the same time, bankers and financiers are now paying close attention to the increasingly serious currency difficulties in China and the backlash from the soaring silver price in Mexico.

<p>(London) According to official news today, silver transactions between brokers at the London Metal Exchange must be settled weekly. This method will be tested for three months. The Exchange Council also has the right to announce special settlements. The weekly settlement price is determined at the end of the first session on Wednesdays. The delivery date is Friday. No special settlements may be held on Saturdays. Exchange brokers must make the same agreement with their customers. The first week's settlement price will be announced on May 8. Copper and tin are settled daily, and those delivered on Saturdays must be settled one day earlier, and those delivered on Sundays will be settled on the next day. Brokers can settle with the exchange weekly in accordance with the methods agreed upon with their customers, or with a minimum deposit of 10%. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Capital" weekly magazine commented on the silver market situation, saying that the rise in silver prices only affects the foreign exchange market in the Far East, causing the currencies of silver-using countries in the Far East to rise against the US dollar. It also said, "Generally, when the silver price rises to 71.11 cents per ounce, the US government will raise the official purchase price again. The purpose of the US government is obviously to increase the international value of the currencies of the Far East and South American countries and restore silver to the status of a remittance product. However, this policy has not yet been officially announced." (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The official price of American silver has risen to 71.185 US cents, so the Suiyo-kai changed the silver price to 79.023 yen, an increase of 1.05 yen compared to the previous day. Furthermore, because the US government announced that it would increase it to 77.57 US cents starting today, it suspended sales in the afternoon. Tomorrow, it will increase the Japanese yen by three, five, or six yen. (25th Domei Telegram)</p>

<h3>Franco-Russian Pact Negotiations Revived, Soviet Union Understands France's Position, Another Method Is Planned So That Both Sides Can Accept It, Laval to Go to Russia in May to Complete Procedures</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval have recently returned to Beijing after the Easter holiday. According to reliable sources, the obstacle to the Franco-Russian negotiations, namely the issue of the two countries automatically providing military assistance to each other, is now being negotiated again, and it will soon be mature. (25th National Society Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The difficulties in concluding a military mutual assistance agreement between France and Russia have been resolved, and the agreement may be signed within days. This news is the main point of the announcement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. Foreign Minister Laval will also go to Moscow on May 6 to complete all the procedures. As for how the currently planned method differs from the original draft agreement, it has not been explained. According to reports, Soviet Russia once insisted that when either country is invaded by another country, the other country should immediately automatically provide military assistance. The French government has no objection to this point, but it is learned that Britain and Italy do not agree very much, which has made France hesitate. In Secretary Simon's mind, the only effective way to maintain peace in Europe is for the major Eastern European powers to assist each other when they are attacked by the air force of an armed country. Therefore, French Prime Minister Flandin convened French legal experts to study how to satisfy both Russia and France, and at the same time not offend Britain and Italy. It is learned that today's announcement that the agreement may be signed next week is the result of experts' research. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, the two sides have been in dispute for many days and have not yet reached an agreement. According to a report in the Business Daily, "The Soviet Union previously requested that if either side is infringed upon by a third country, the mutual assistance system should be applied mechanically. In France, due to the original constraints of the Locarno Pact, it is argued that the Council of the League of Nations should be requested to convene a meeting first, and only after its approval can military assistance be given to the other party. Later, the French government proposed a compromise plan to the Soviet Union as a way to reconcile, arguing that when one of the contracting countries is infringed upon by a third country, it should request the Council of the League of Nations to convene a meeting. In other words, even if one of the contracting countries is infringed upon, it should be submitted to the Council for discussion, but if both contracting countries want to provide assistance to each other with strength, they do not have to wait for the Council to convene a meeting before doing so." (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Franco-Russian agreement has recently been negotiated by the two countries, and some details have not yet been agreed upon. It is learned that if no unexpected events occur, the People's Committee (i.e., the Soviet Cabinet) will meet tomorrow to discuss the position taken by the Soviet Union on this issue. Furthermore, the impression gained by Havas reporter Lao after a private conversation with people familiar with Soviet foreign policy is that the future of the Franco-Russian agreement negotiations is, on the whole, not unfavorable, and that any difficulties are by no means insurmountable. It is expected that the Soviet Union will adopt a method that takes into account France's legitimate concerns as much as possible. France wants to harmonize the constraints it will take with the constraints already concluded by France. On the one hand, France hopes to stabilize the danger of German aggression in an appropriate way, and on the other hand, it also hopes to make it easier for Poland to participate in the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact. The Soviet Union has fully understood this point of view of France. According to people familiar with Soviet foreign policy, the Franco-Russian agreement is not intended to surround Germany, but to unite friendly countries with peaceful determination to form a fully strong front, so as to resist German imperialism with a peaceful policy and curb its outward conflict. Moreover, the relationship between France and Poland has recently eased, and the Soviet Union is quite satisfied with this. However, what the Soviet Union has always insisted on is that there must be resolute action at present, and that the trivial circumstances arising from all future events should not be over-worried. According to past experience, whenever a serious conflict occurs, it is of little importance to consider all the subtle points of law everywhere. It is almost pedantic to make meticulous considerations on the law while the other party is willing to tear up the treaty. This conversation is quite representative of the views of the Soviet authorities. Furthermore, the Soviet newspapers are completely silent about the negotiations on the Franco-Russian agreement, for fear that publishing comments may hinder the progress of the negotiations. The Soviet Union has gentle feelings and does not want to act rashly, which can also be seen in this matter. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italian and French Convening: The Rome Nine-Nation Conference to Conclude a General Non-Interference Treaty and Draft Proposals for Seeking Opinions from All Parties</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Stresa Conference of England, France, and Italy decided to convene a nine-nation conference of the Danube River countries in Rome. Various diplomatic preparations are now underway for this conference. Italy advocates holding the meeting in early June. Italy and France have jointly invited Austria, Yugoslavia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania to participate. Each participating country will send its foreign minister to attend. The main purpose of the conference is to seek common respect for Austria's independence and territorial integrity. The approach is divided into two types: (1) concluding a general non-interference in internal affairs treaty; (2) agreeing on sanctions in the event that the above treaty is violated. Regarding the non-interference treaty, it is reported that a draft has been prepared and sent to relevant countries for study. So far, most countries have accepted the draft. Poland and Hungary have only expressed acceptance in principle. Germany has requested a more precise interpretation of the term "non-interference in internal affairs." As for the methods of sanctioning violations of the treaty, relevant countries will separately conclude agreements within the framework of the League of Nations. These agreements can take the form of mutual assistance pacts and should be bilateral rather than multilateral. If all invited countries participate in the Danube River Conference and all participating countries conclude such bilateral agreements with each other, a total of thirty-six agreements could be concluded. However, some countries, such as Poland, may only accept the non-interference treaty and be unwilling to adopt other restrictions, which is also unknown. In addition, the issue of rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria can also be usefully discussed in Rome, but not in formal meetings. This is because the Danube River Conference has not formally included this issue on the agenda. According to the decision of the Stresa Conference, the issue of rearmament in Central Europe should be seriously considered only after a general and regional security guarantee solution has been agreed upon. Therefore, this issue can only be discussed informally in Rome to initiate a solution and ultimately be submitted to the League of Nations for resolution. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Germany Requests Five Clarifications</p>
<p>(Rome) Although the intended goals of the nine-nation Danube River Conference are limited to guaranteeing Austria's independence and territorial integrity, it has already raised various issues during the preparatory meetings. Diplomatic authorities are now trying to resolve them before the conference begins. Germany previously sent a note to the French and Italian governments, stating that the Danube River Pact proposed in the Rome Agreement of January 7 lacked clarity. It specifically raised these questions and requested detailed explanations: (1) Switzerland is Austria's neighbor, why was it not invited to join the Danube River Pact in the Rome Agreement? Moreover, the UK's interests in Central Europe are no less than France's, why was the UK not invited to participate? The Italian government replied that Switzerland is a permanently neutral country and cannot sign mutual assistance pacts. The UK is unwilling to adopt other restrictions besides the Locarno Pact, so it was not invited to join the Danube River Pact. (2) If the Danube River Pact is signed, will the agreement between the UK, France, and Italy to consult each other in the event of a violation of Austria's independence (the Anglo-Franco-Italian declaration of September 27 last year) remain in effect? Italy replied that if all relevant countries, including Germany, join the non-interference treaty, then this consultation can be terminated. (3) Is the non-interference treaty limited to agreeing not to interfere in internal affairs, or must signatory countries also approve a mutual assistance pact? Italy replied that signatory countries should conclude special agreements to protect the principles of the non-interference treaty, but whether or not to sign is still up to each country to decide. (4) What is the precise meaning of "non-interference in internal affairs"? Italy replied that the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement of January 7 provided an explanation: each signatory country agrees not to encourage or support any incitement or propaganda that aims to undermine the territorial integrity and political and social systems of the signatory countries. (5) What role will the League of Nations play after the Danube River Pact is implemented? Italy replied that the League of Nations' task will naturally be in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. The above is the Italian government's explanation. After receiving the Italian reply, Germany found the explanations for the first, second, and third questions satisfactory, but raised objections to the answers to the last two questions. The German ambassador to Italy, Mr. Hassell, is said to have inquired of the Italian government in a private capacity whether it would violate the principle of non-interference in internal affairs if the Austrian government requested foreign military assistance to maintain its position. In addition, there are many other issues that need to be studied, the most important of which is the final resolution of the dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia regarding the assassination in Marseille. As for the issue of Hungarian rearmament, it must wait until a Central European security system is established before it can be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Publishes Article Criticizing Germany's Treaty-Breaking Actions, Hoping to Implement the Three-Nation Resolution to Prove Peaceful Intentions</h3>
<p>(London) The National Labour Party's organ published an article by Prime Minister MacDonald today on the situation in Europe, stating that the essence of all of Germany's actions stems from a rational background. The talks in Berlin indicated several points that need further study to contribute to a collective security system. However, the manner of Germany's actions has damaged the sentiment of mutual trust in Europe. Germany has destroyed the path to peace and filled it with terror. Germany's plan to demand military force will subject most European countries to its whip. Leaving aside honor and debate, how can Germany claim to be blind to the impact of its vast military buildup on the security of other countries? Germany may answer, "You must trust me, I have no designs on you." Germany was the safest country in Europe until it aroused fears that were detrimental to itself. Now it asks other countries to accept its verbal vows of peace, which it has not accepted from its neighbors. It is excessive for the German people to ask countries to recognize the legitimacy of their aims and means without the slightest suspicion by those who know them best. The door to an honorable solution is still open. Will Germany immediately announce its readiness to participate in making the resolutions of the Stresa Conference effective, thereby proving its peaceful intentions? (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Forget Old Colonies: Memorials Held Simultaneously in Berlin and Africa</h3>
<p>(Berlin) On April 24, 1884, Bismarck placed the land owned by the Bremen merchant Lüderitz in Southwest Africa under the protection of the German government, marking the beginning of German colonies. Today, the fifty-first anniversary is being held here. Members of the German Colonial Society and the Colonial Warriors Association are wearing old colonial uniforms and placing wreaths at the monument to Bismarck, the founder of German colonies. Former personnel of the German colonies in Southwest Africa are also holding the fiftieth anniversary of the appointment of Dr. Hintrager as the German official in charge of the Southwest African protectorate. This shows that the Germans have not forgotten their lost colonies. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Pays Attention to Wartime Neutrality Issues</h3>

<h3>U.S. Navy Reorganizes Fleet and Replaces Asian Flagship, Japan Believes it Has Great Significance, Pacific Maneuvers to Begin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. authorities announced three military plans on the 19th, which can indicate the U.S. Navy's operational policy in the Pacific. One is the plan for a North Pacific air exercise, the second is to improve the various facilities of the army and navy in the Panama Canal, and the Senate Military Committee will appoint a special committee to study the issue of restricting railway employees in the canal zone to those with U.S. citizenship. The third is to incorporate the Asiatic Fleet flagship Augusta (10,000 tons, equipped with 8-inch guns) into the United Fleet, and replace it with the light cruiser Omaha (7,000 tons, equipped with 6-inch guns) as the Asiatic Fleet flagship. This plan is most noteworthy, because if war breaks out between Japan and the U.S., the Asiatic Fleet will inevitably be a sacrificial fleet, so it is advisable to have a light cruiser with very high speed as the flagship. The Augusta and other 14 first-class cruisers are divided into three teams to prepare the wheel formation adopted by the U.S. fleet when crossing the Pacific. (Nichi-Ren dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House debated the naval budget bill today. Democratic Congressman Maverick issued a warning, saying that the United States' plan to expand its navy may become an obstacle to world peace. The bill was passed by the Appropriations Committee yesterday, with a total budget of $465,286,261 after the committee reduced it by $15 million, an increase of $174,879,098 compared to the previous budget. Mr. Maverick recently proposed a non-war proposal, advocating that the U.S. army and navy should only be used for self-defense and prohibiting the U.S. from lending to other countries during wartime. Mr. Maverick said that he had conducted a detailed study before submitting the bill and had discussed it in advance with many international law experts. However, the bill is not intended to direct U.S. foreign policy, but its main purpose is to prevent the U.S. from being drawn into the vortex of conflicts in other countries. As for the future of the naval budget bill, although there is some opposition at present, observers expect that it will be able to pass both houses safely. According to reliable sources, the bill has been supported by President Roosevelt, Navy Secretary Swanson, and Democratic leaders in Congress. At the same time, the entire U.S. fleet has been concentrated in the areas of San Diego and Saint Peter, preparing to set off for maneuvers. The Navy Secretary announced that the first few days of the maneuvers will be held along the coast. On May 3, 153 warships will sail into the open ocean. By the time the fleet arrives in the Hawaiian Islands in late May, the main maneuver plan will be realized. It is currently tentatively scheduled that the fleet will maneuver in Hawaii for about a week, and then return to San Diego to participate in the California Pacific International Exposition.

<h3>British Government Invites Germany to Participate in Naval Conference, German Experts to Visit London Early Next Month for Informal Exchange of Views</h3>
<p>(London) German naval experts will come to London in early May to have informal discussions with British experts on issues such as naval limitations. The Washington and London Naval Treaties stipulated that a naval limitation conference must be convened this year. For preparatory purposes, representatives from France, Italy, Japan, and the United States have separately held bilateral talks. The British government aims to convene a universal naval conference, so it believes it is necessary to invite representatives of the German government to join the discussion. Therefore, it sent an invitation to Germany to discuss it, and Germany agreed. Thus, there was a move to send personnel to the UK for an informal exchange of views. The arrival of German naval experts in the UK is the first time since the war. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Rearming its Navy, Actively Proceeding with Shipbuilding Program, Adding Large Cruisers and Submarines</h3>
<p>(London) The Morning Post published an article yesterday expressing concern about Germany's rearmament of its navy. Today, the Daily Telegraph also published an editorial, which said, "Germany will hold a memorial for the Battle of Jutland on May 31 (the great battle between the British and German navies in the Jutland Strait during the European War). The German government will also issue a formal statement at that time to explain the main points of its naval policy and shipbuilding plan. Currently, Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, and Bremen are openly preparing for shipbuilding. It is reported that the government has promised the shipyard in Hamburg alone to give it 40,000 tons of shipbuilding work this year." The Daily Telegraph predicted that Germany's shipbuilding program will include cruisers and submarines, and that cruisers will be divided into two types: one weaker than the French armored cruiser Dunkerque (26,500 tons displacement, 30 knots speed, equipped with eight 13-inch guns), and one larger than the existing German cruisers Karlsruhe and Leipzig (6,000 tons displacement, 32 knots speed, equipped with nine 6-inch guns), and its armament is also stronger. As for the tonnage of submarines, although it is similar to that of foreign new submarines, in terms of engine weapons and range of activity, it far exceeds them. The Daily Telegraph concluded that when the European War Peace Treaty was signed in 1919, Germany had about 700 young naval officers who were proficient in submarine piloting. Most of them are still under 40 years old. If they are appointed to the positions of submarine commander or instructor, they will certainly be able to do it well. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Abolition of Silk Cocoon Transit Tax</h3>

<p>The Shaanxi China Foreign Famine Relief Association begs the charity of all philanthropists forwarded by the Shen Bao. Shaanxi has suffered a devastating drought in recent years, and the assistance has been unforgettable. Unfortunately, communist bandits have invaded southern Shaanxi, and the counties have been devastated. Ningqiang, Mianxian, Baocheng, and Zhashui counties have suffered the most, which is heartbreaking. More than twenty counties in Xinghan have been ravaged by arson, murder, and looting, and no county has been spared. The elders, sons, and daughters have been displaced, and the cries of hunger and cold fill the wilderness. We earnestly hope that benevolent people will generously donate aid to save the survivors and show universal compassion. The telegram cannot express the urgency of the situation.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Orders the Rectification of Sichuan Province's Finances</h3>
<h3>Taking the Rectification of Finances in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi as a Model</h3>
<h3>Instructing the Provincial Government to Forward to All Counties for Reference, Selection, and Implementation</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: For the sake of rectifying local finances in Sichuan Province, Chairman Chiang specially sent a fast mail telegram on the 20th, enclosing a compiled volume of the Regulations for Rectifying County Local Finances in Bandit Suppression Areas and related laws and regulations, ordering Provincial Chairman Liu to follow them. The original order is as follows: "To Chairman Liu of the Chongqing Provincial Government: Upon investigating the situation of local finances in various counties of Sichuan, it is found that due to the separation of defense zones in the past, the establishment of separate regimes, and the large number of local militias, all military, political, and militia expenses were arbitrarily demanded and freely apportioned locally. From military commanders to county magistrates, collection bureau chiefs, and village elders, all contrived names to carry out exploitation. Therefore, the annual collection of land tax in each county was carried out seven or eight times, or even more than ten times. The various other exorbitant taxes were even more numerous. Multiple taxes on one item and multiple levies on one tax were seen as the norm. Tax collectors and clerks followed each other to the people, and public and private checkpoints were everywhere. At the same time, there was no method of supervision or auditing for all collection and payment items within each county. Exaggerated collections, fabricated reports, embezzlement, and corruption were rampant. Even taxes that had been explicitly exempted were still privately collected by the responsible personnel. As a result, the people of each county, although exhausted by their contributions, were still unable to meet the various military, political, and economic expenses. The situation was precarious. The people suffered more than being hung upside down, and the authorities sat idly by, accumulating resentment, resulting in self-enrichment for corrupt local tyrants. This chaotic local finance phenomenon is unprecedented in any other province. Since the reorganization and establishment of the provincial government, the various military defense zones and political control have been voluntarily returned. Subsequently, the provincial government has been responsible for the overall planning and reduction of various exorbitant taxes and levies of the province's treasury and has begun to rectify them. However, the chaos of local finances in each county is even greater than that of the provincial finances. Without thorough reform measures, it will be impossible to alleviate suffering, eliminate accumulated evils, and achieve the practical results of rescuing the people and enriching the treasury. When I was supervising the bandit suppression in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, I specially formulated the Regulations for Rectifying County Local Finances in Bandit Suppression Areas, which were first implemented in the four provinces. As a result, the county local finances of each province became orderly and gradually entered the right track. The burden on the people was thereby reduced, and the local revenue and expenditure were suitable. Just taking the militia expenses of the two provinces of Henan and Hubei as an example, before the promulgation of these regulations, the annual expenses of each province ranged from 12 million to 15 million yuan, not including the expenses inflated and unaccounted for by those in charge. After the implementation of these regulations, the annual militia expenses of Henan and Hubei have been reduced to 4 million or 5 million yuan, and there is no possibility of any additional needs. Other expenditures are also roughly the same, and the results are remarkable, as can be seen in general. The main points of these regulations are: First, unify the agencies for various public funds. All county-owned public funds and public property income and expenditure matters in the county, such as education, militia defense, self-government, and charity, shall be handled by the finance committee established by the county government, implementing unified collection and unified expenditure, eliminating the past malpractices of divergent agencies, self-collection, self-expenditure, and scattered unaccountability. Second, strictly implement the budget and final account system. All county local additional taxes and other income, as well as all expense expenditures, shall be prepared in accordance with regulations, with budget and final accounts. Items already budgeted shall not be diverted for other purposes. Expenditures outside the budget, the use of reserve funds, and increases or decreases in taxes shall be rejected by the finance committee without the approval of the provincial government. Then, the abuses of indiscriminate spending, false consumption, and the free fundraising by institutions and groups in the local area will no longer be able to succeed. Third, divide the responsibilities of payment and management. The county magistrate holds the authority of payment, while the finance committee is responsible for the receipt and expenditure of all cash. The finance committee is also responsible for auditing whether the county budget and final accounts are appropriate and verifiable. At the same time, the county magistrate can still supervise and inspect the cash managed by the finance committee at any time. In addition, it is stipulated that the members of the finance committee must be just people from the urban and rural areas of the county, who will naturally attach importance to local funds. Therefore, with the separation of powers and mutual supervision between the finance committee and the county magistrate, it will not be difficult to gradually eliminate the past abuses of embezzlement, false reports, and misappropriation of public funds. All of these are the most effective ways to correct the chaos of local finances in various counties of Sichuan and are also the most effective measures for preliminary rectification. It should be known that county local affairs are the foundation of national administration and provincial administration, and county finance is the foundation of all county local affairs. If it is not followed in the right way and handled in an orderly manner, officials and people will inevitably be in distress and unable to cope. How can there be any administrative efficiency to speak of? The past situation in Sichuan can serve as a warning. This is not only something that the officials of the province should have a clear understanding of, but also something that the local people should have a thorough understanding of. Therefore, I have specially enclosed a compiled volume of the Regulations for Rectifying County Local Finances in Bandit Suppression Areas and related laws and regulations, and issued them by telegram. I hope that you will immediately order all counties to strictly implement them and supervise them closely. Do not deviate from them due to inaction. The origins of each county's revenue and expenditure items should also be transferred to fill in the forms for investigation and review within a limited time. In addition, the various chapters, rules, forms, and documents attached to the regulations, whether promulgated by the central government or established and implemented by other provinces, are all good rules for rectifying finances and effective methods for implementation. In particular, they should be referred to for selection and implementation in order to achieve perfection. I also request that you transfer the instructions for compliance and report the compliance situation for record. Chiang Kai-shek (April 20th, Secret, Calculated Enclosed One Volume of the Regulations for Rectifying County Local Finances in Bandit Suppression Areas and Related Laws and Regulations)" (Central News Agency, April 22nd)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Various Circles Oppose Swire's New Pier —Water Transport Groups Also Have Disputes with Swire—</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Xiamen branch of the British Swire Shipping Company was originally located in the most prosperous area of Haihoutan. When the former Municipal Office constructed Zhongshan Road, the company's location was deemed suitable for an intersection and urgently needed to be demolished and ceded. As a result, Swire agreed to cede the land but requested another plot of land for relocation. Yang Decong of Changyu Company, with the permission of Zhou Xingnan, the director of the Municipal Office, filled the new land in front of Tongwen Road and the right to build near the shore customs building, and sold it to Swire for 500,000 yuan in a perpetual lease. The Municipal Office received 100,000 yuan for the land price, and Yang received 400,000 yuan for the filling fee. This perpetual lease contract was signed by Swire, Yang Decong, and the Road Administration Office, and was officially sealed and established by successive Siming County magistrates Yang Tingshu and Xu Youchao after being sent to the British Consulate in Xiamen. Swire then used the land price from selling the old company address to pay the lease price and built the new pier and the customs bridge on Tongwen Road. Last year (1934), various circles in Xiamen opposed Swire's perpetual lease of the new pier and Lin Mutu, a Taiwanese citizen, purchasing land in Maohoushe, Heshan, to operate the Xiamen South Reclamation Company, and formed the "Committee Against Zhou Xingnan's Unauthorized Sale of National Land," which filed a complaint with the central government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent treaty commissioner Liu Guangqian to Xiamen to investigate the entire case. After reporting back to Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently sent Lin Shaonan, the special inspector for Fujian and Zhejiang, to Fujian to be responsible for handling both cases. The construction of Swire's new pier and bridge was completed this month. In the future, Swire's northbound and southbound ships, as well as the Nanxiang, can directly dock, and passengers and goods can directly land. However, large and small ships in Xiamen Port all dock in the sea, and passengers and goods are transported by large ships and small boats. Therefore, workers who make a living from sea transport believe that the completion of Swire's new pier will have a significant impact. The Federation of Water Transport Groups has launched an opposition, and at the same time, the anti-Zhou association opposing the perpetual lease has also submitted a request to the central government, urging a speedy resolution to the case, arresting Zhou Xingnan and Yang Decong, canceling the contract according to the agreement, recovering the land valuation, and purchasing the new pier. The trend was very strong for a while. However, amidst opposition from all sides, Swire Company's writing room, comprador's office, and entire warehouse moved from the old site in Haihou to the new pier on Tongwen Road on the 23rd and officially opened for business on the same day. However, the consulate issued a message stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the special inspector for Fujian and Zhejiang had not recently delivered any negotiation documents regarding this case to the British Embassy in China or the Xiamen Consulate. Therefore, the British Consulate here is taking a silent attitude on this case. Swire's move to the new pier has obtained formal perpetual lease procedures from the local Chinese government. Although the public has reacted, there is no possibility of preventing the move unless the Chinese diplomatic authorities raise any objections or special circumstances arise. Moreover, with the completion of the new pier, the old pier has already begun to be demolished, and the agreement should be fulfilled. If the Chinese diplomatic authorities have any objections to this in the future, both parties can still resolve it peacefully. Moving in or not moving in will not be a problem, etc. As for the negotiation between the water transport groups and Swire, it is about the opposition to the flyover issue, which is a different matter from the opposition to the perpetual lease issue. It has been agreed with Swire that the proposed conditions will be temporarily implemented before Swire's London headquarters has signed and replied to all vessels, and will not dock at the new pier. This is the result of direct negotiation between the water transport groups and Swire. The Committee Against Zhou Xingnan's Unauthorized Sale of National Land sent another telegram to the Nanjing National Government on the 21st, insisting on the revocation of the agreement signed by Zhou and Swire, and the valuation of the buildings to be recovered by the government for use by domestic shipping companies to protect national rights.

<h3>He Chengjun Returns to Hankou Awaiting the Establishment of the Guizhou Provincial Government Before Returning to Sichuan Staff Office Provincial Government Decides to Move Office to Chengdu</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhu and Mao's remnant bandits recklessly attacked Guiyang, suffering a major loss of strength. Bandit leaders Zhu De and Lin Biao were also killed in battle one after another. The stubborn bandit forces suddenly showed a trend of disintegration. Although the remaining bandits are moving south along Baiyan Mountain, attempting to flee through the border, there are heavy troops on all sides, and they will definitely not be able to cross the Lei Pond again. The Xu Xiangqian faction in northern Sichuan, although crossing Jialing, has had its perilous pass of the Fujiang River seized by Deng's army, preventing them from moving west. The Shaanxi-Gansu army from north to south, and the various Sichuan armies from east to west, have surrounded them on all sides, and they will not be allowed to run amok. Looking at the overall situation, although it has not yet come to an end, the remnant bandits are in a desperate situation and will eventually not be able to escape. The Sichuan Provincial Government had considered moving to Chengdu as early as a month ago, but it did not materialize due to urgent military matters. Now, it has been decided to move together with the staff office of the expeditionary headquarters in order to command the entire Sichuan and come and go. He Chengjun, the pacification envoy stationed in Hubei, who participated in the military affairs in Sichuan, took time to return to Hubei to handle important official matters due to the smooth progress of the bandit suppression campaign. He also met with Xu Yuanquan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan border areas, and instructed him on the strategies for clearing out the border bandits. On the 23rd, He took a postal plane from Chongqing to return east, staying in Shashi for one day, giving instructions to Yang Shaodong, Xu's chief of staff. Xu Fang, a teacher in Enshi, originally intended to take a plane to pay his respects, but stopped according to He's telegram. On the morning of the 24th, He inspected the directly subordinate troops of the Tenth Army in Shashi and convened officers above the company commander for instruction. At 11:40, he took off on the No. 319 military plane of the Third Aviation Team, arriving at the Fenjinlu seaplane base in Hankou at 12:40, and then went to the pacification headquarters to work. According to He's talk, he was summoned by telegram from Chairman Chiang and stayed in Sichuan for more than a month. The bandit suppression military affairs have been developing smoothly. The bandits are the remnants of Zhu Mao, etc. Due to the vigorous and painful suppression by the national army, they suffered the greatest losses, so they avoided the real and went for the weak, fleeing in a panic. Guiyang is located in the middle of thousands of mountains. A part of the remnant bandits' guerrillas approached Guiyang and were defeated by our 99th Division. The remaining bandits are also trapped in an encirclement and will soon be eliminated. Chairman Chiang is still in Guizhou and will return to Sichuan to sit and镇 after the new government of that province is established. Xu Fei in Sichuan is trapped west of the Jialing River, unable to advance or retreat. Previously, a small number of people moved their families to the province, causing panic. In fact, the army is gathered and the defense is solid. Chengdu is definitely not in danger. The staff office of the expeditionary headquarters and the Sichuan Provincial Government will move to Chengdu to work recently. As for the construction of Sichuan Province, it has made progress compared to before. The New Life Movement is also vigorously underway. After I finish processing the important official matters of the pacification headquarters, I will go to Enshi in western Hubei to inspect and meet with Commander-in-Chief Xu (Yuanquan). A week later, I will still go to Chongqing to assist. He also said that Gu Zhutong was summoned by telegram from Chairman Chiang and will go to Guizhou from Hankou within days. (24th)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Taiwanese People's Recent Actions The Old and New Factions Have Different Opinions on Gambling Prohibition Taiwanese People's Smuggling of Private Goods Reaches Millions Annually</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Japanese Consul General in Fuzhou, Usami Takehiko, has recently taken serious measures to ban gambling dens opened by Taiwanese people residing in Fuzhou. The Taiwanese people residing in Fuzhou can be divided into the old and new factions. The old faction has been in Fujian for a long time, and has gained huge profits over the years. Most of them have established families and businesses, and express their support for the gambling prohibition, advocating to stop here and switch to legitimate businesses. The new faction is mostly vagrant people who live entirely by operating illegal businesses. They express their opposition to the gambling prohibition, advocating disrupting public order as a demonstration. In recent days, the old and new factions have held meetings at the Taiwan Association in Cangxia Zhou, arguing fiercely. Therefore, although the old faction's gambling dens have closed down, the new faction's gambling dens are still secretly opening. When the police go to stop them, conflicts occur. A few days ago, a gambling den on Taijiang Fan was setting up stalls on the street for gambling, and the audience was extremely crowded. When the police dispersed them, the Taiwanese people from that gambling den actually rushed to the Fourth Public Security Bureau and snatched the police guns. The sub-bureau notified the Japanese Consulate by telephone, and the Taiwanese police were dispatched to arrest two rioters, and the crowd dispersed. Therefore, the gambling atmosphere in Fuzhou has still not been completely eliminated. A few days ago, Taiwanese rich gentry and member of the Japanese House of Peers elected by imperial command, Koo Hsien-jung, accompanied by the provincial government's senior adviser Li Zeyi, came to Fujian from Taiwan to inspect, and also did not approve of the behavior of the Taiwanese overseas Chinese. He gave a speech at the Taiwan Association, advising his fellow countrymen to switch to legitimate businesses to avoid damaging the overall reputation, and requested the Japanese Consul to find ways to ban those whose reputations are bad and who repeatedly commit illegal acts, and they should be sent back to their hometowns. Li Zeyi also talked about the out-of-bounds actions of the Taiwanese people in Fuzhou and Xiamen, such as setting up opium dens, gambling dens, pawnshops, and Taiwan-based organizations, which gave the Chinese a bad impression and hindered Sino-Japanese friendship. Koo promised to forward the request to the Governor-General of Taiwan, and should carefully issue licenses to Taiwanese people who cross over to Fujian. Those who do not have a legitimate occupation and those who were previously deported should not be allowed to come again. Koo has already returned to Taiwan yesterday. In addition, there is one more thing that is particularly noteworthy, and that is that the coastal areas of Changle and Fuqing counties are very close to the Taiwan ocean. The villagers often collude with Taiwanese people to smuggle military supplies and private goods from Taiwan, such as tax-evaded white sugar and matches, which are imported from remote locations. The military supplies are sold to bandits, and the private goods are sold to merchants, gaining huge profits. The annual trade volume reaches five to six million yuan. The villagers are known for their brutality, and they also have Taiwanese people to escort them. Although the customs has patrol ships, it is impossible to intercept them. A few days ago, the Fujian Customs sent personnel to lead a battalion of military police to search the villages and townships of Jiangtian and Songxia in Changle, and seized a large number of pistols, white sugar, and kerosene, but the smugglers had already escaped and could not be captured.

<h3>Songjiang A Grand Gathering of Automobile Companies</h3>
<p>The fourth membership meeting of the Jing-Su-Hu Private Long-Distance Bus Company United Association was held in Songjiang this time. At 11:30 yesterday morning, two special vehicles drove directly from Shanghai to Songjiang, and stopped at the city bus station of the Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company. The members included twelve companies, such as Shangnan Mu Shuzai, Hu-Tai Zhu Kaichou, Shangchuan Qu Shaoyi, Jiangnan Wu Zhuozhi, Xi-Cheng Sun Chenchu, Zhenyang Lu Shaoliu, Huashang Huang Zhongwen, Hu-Min Li Jinhou, Zhen-Dan Jin-Li Jiang Kesheng, Wu-Yi Chen Songmao, Xi-Hu Wang Xiaolai, and Shangsong Yin Shisheng, as well as two additional attending members from each company, totaling thirty-six people. After lunch at the station, the ceremony was opened. Shen Baixian, Director of the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, sent representative Zhang Di, and Jin Baoguang, Magistrate of Songjiang County, and Secretary Wu Zhongyu, attended the meeting. First, Chairman Jiang Kesheng reported, followed by speeches from Representative Zhang and County Magistrate Jin, with many sincere words. Then, the chairman invited Wang Xiaolai, Mu Shuzai, Lu Shaoliu, Wu Zhuozhi, Qu Shaoyi, and Yin Shisheng to give speeches successively. They gave very thorough reports on the difficulties faced by merchants in operating long-distance bus companies and the lack of understanding from a few people in society. Then, the meeting discussed the association's affairs and re-elected officers, and the photography session ended at 5:30 in the afternoon. The original vehicles returned to Shanghai. It is said that they were staying at the Dahua Hotel, and they will visit and tour the next day.</p>
<h3>Family Dispute to Be Transferred to Court</h3>
<p>The Cao family, residing in Xishi Lane in this city, married Yao Zhang's daughter Weihua as their wife. Both parties were engaged in the rice industry. Because of the same industry, they were married. Since their marriage, the couple's relationship has been good. Unexpectedly, Zhang Shunlan (also known as Boxuan), who was in the same industry, often visited the Cao family and gradually became intimate with Yao Weihua. One day, they went to Shanghai together. When they got off the train at the South Railway Station, Zhang Shunlan suddenly left without saying goodbye. Yao Weihua returned to Songjiang and was rejected by her husband's family, who reported to the Second Police Station, saying that she had absconded with money. Yao also claimed that her aunt, Ma, intended to force her to remarry, and secretly colluded with Zhang Shunlan to use cunning tricks to frame an innocent family woman. She reported to the Second Police Station for investigation. Police Officer Luo determined that it was a family dispute and instructed them to resolve it in court.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Agricultural Bank Collects Land Tax on Behalf</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, in order to eliminate the long-standing problems of land tax and improve the collection system, formulated the regulations for land tax collection in various counties and the rules for land tax collection in various counties. The detailed regulations on the method of bank collection of taxes were specified. It ordered Zhenjiang and other seven counties to conduct a trial, and the results were very good. It advocated gradually promoting it to other counties for rectification. It has now designated Wuxi, Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengxian, Jinshan, Shanghai and other six counties to follow suit from the 24th year. It ordered the above counties to quickly consult with local banks, conduct detailed research, and formulate appropriate measures to submit to the department for approval and implementation. After receiving the order, the local county government has decided to convene representatives from the Agricultural Bank and the county's finance department at 2:00 p.m. on the 27th of this month to hold a meeting to discuss and jointly discuss the implementation plan.</p>
<h3>River Dredging Collapse Kills and Injures Workers</h3>
<p>Changguang Creek in the third district of the county is also one of the six major rivers dredged in this year's work account. The entire river extends from the southern part of the country to Zhouxin Town. Since the start of construction, it has not been completed due to rainy weather. However, the section of the west river is too narrow and does not have a sufficient width. The house of Lu Xiaohe Shang of the East River is also built along the river, and the revetment stands in the heart of the river, hindering water conservancy and transportation. The Construction Bureau has stipulated that when dredging the river, the revetment should be ordered to be demolished. On the evening of the 24th, dozens of craftsmen were demolishing the revetment built by the Lu family for the third time. Due to the loosening of the stone feet, it suddenly collapsed, injuring more than a dozen workers. Among them, Xi Aquan was crushed into the mud and died on the spot. Hang Wanggen, Dai Peide, and Gu Shunquan were also seriously injured and may be in danger of life. Wang Mingqing, the town mayor of Southern Spring Town, and Lu Haishan, the seventh bao chief, reported the information to the Third District Office, which forwarded it to the Construction Bureau. At the same time, the injured were sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. In addition, the Lujiang River project in the fourth district is expected to be fully completed in the next few days. However, the second section of the Shengdian Bridge project suddenly leaked from the dam foundation. The villagers were dissatisfied with the district chief's guidance and gathered to make trouble, causing a work stoppage. They also beat District Chief Zhu Biao and smashed the doors, windows, and belongings of Xiang Chief Zhang Erjia's house. Yesterday (25th) morning, County Magistrate Yan, accompanied by Director Zhang of the Construction Bureau, went to the countryside to investigate the truth of the incident, and convened the township and bao chiefs of the area to give earnest speeches, urging them to continue working and complete the project as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Changzhou The Construction Department Sends Commissioners to Supervise River Work</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department considered that the early disaster relief dredging work in Jiangnan has reached a critical juncture. If it is delayed further, the busy farming season will arrive, and the project will not be easy to complete after the spring waters rise sharply. It specially sent Chief Secretary Xiao Yingyu and Chief Investment Officer Gu Shiji to inspect the work sites, guide the direction of progress at any time. Secretary Xiao, accompanied by Chen Ziding, Director of the Canal Dredging and Relief Office, observed along the river from Lucheng on the 24th and arrived in Changzhou, staying at No. 41 Dacheng Hotel. According to reports, the Construction Department decided to complete Sections 5, 6, and 7, which are prosperous commercial areas, by May 15th. It will go to Qishuyan Quanlin area for inspection within days, and then return to the province. It is also heard that County Magistrate Hou also hopes to complete the dredging project as soon as possible to facilitate transportation. He personally instructed the township mayors to urge the workers to speed up the dredging.</p>
<h3>Changshu A Beautiful Concubine Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Gui Mengjian of Liuheyan in this county, a graduate of Shanghai Guanghua University, once worked as a staff member of the local Finance Bureau. Gui was young and romantic and got to know the Suzhou prostitute Xue Zhu, whom he soon took as a concubine. Their relationship was very harmonious. Unexpectedly, Gui recently had another lover and ignored Xue. Recently, he took three more concubines named Miss Ba and hid them in a golden house. Xue's relationship with him became more and more distant. Xue felt pity for her life and suddenly had the idea of suicide. On the evening of the 18th, she bought half a catty of Xilu liquor and swallowed sleeping pills. It broke out at 11:00 p.m., and she was sent to a famous doctor for treatment. But because she took too much poison, she died in the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Murder of Son Autopsy Examination</h3>
<p>Wang Kuanshun, a farmer in Daijiamen Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, and his wife, Zhang, are both 65 years old. Their son, Furong, is 48 years old, does not work properly, and is addicted to opium. His daughter-in-law is dead, leaving behind three grandsons. The eldest, Xiaolong, is over 20 years old, the second son is 13 years old, and the youngest, Yang Jianwu, is five years old. In February of this year, Kuanshun died of illness. Zhang arranged for the coffin and burial, but Furong prevented the sale of the fields and demanded money from his mother to smoke opium. His mother did not agree. Then, Furong chopped the coffin with an axe to force her to give him money. The mother thought that her son was so unfilial that it would be difficult to support her in her old age, so she secretly planned to kill her son. She secretly agreed with her friends Shi and others to strangle Furong on the night of the fifteenth day of the first lunar month and bury him overnight. The young grandson Yang'er was suffering from smallpox and did not sleep at night, witnessing the situation, but dared not speak out. The next day, a neighbor told him, and Yang'er also died suddenly on the 16th. The neighbors suspected that Zhang had killed him again and secretly reported to the county government through the chief. After investigation by the county government, it was confirmed to be true. Zhang and Shi Jiakang were arrested and taken to the county and transferred to the Zhenjiang District Court for handling according to law. After several investigations by Prosecutor Li Shu, it was considered that the autopsy would not be enough to prove the matter. Therefore, on the 24th, he dug up the coffin and the corpse of Yang'er and examined them in an empty field at Dajue Temple outside the South Gate. The citizens thought the case was bizarre and thousands of people came to watch the news. After Prosecutor Li took the seat on the scene, he summoned everyone for questioning and ordered the coffin to be opened. Furong's body had rotted. The teeth were found to be red, and there were wounds on the hands and feet. One tooth was broken on the left, and there was a hard wound on the waist. It was confirmed that he had been injured and died before his death. Yang'er's body was placed in a large cattail bag, with mud all over his body. He was first washed with water, and there were red spots all over his body, but no wounds. It was because he died of smallpox. After the coroner finished the examination, the prosecutor ordered Xiaolong to collect the remains, and the defendants were sent back to prison to await investigation.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Disaster Relief Loan and Seed Distribution in Huxi</h3>
<p>Dong Zhongxin and Wang Jingcheng, the heads of the disaster relief loan distribution committee in Huxi, this county, have taken the relief tickets to Huxi, where they will distribute them together with Liu Lingsheng of Yangzhou. The association has raised 2,642 yuan and 7 jiao, and 168 yuan is still to be paid. 80% of the relief money will go to the seriously affected areas in the seventh district, and 20% will go to the eighth district. In addition, the food management committee will allocate 1,000 dan of loan seeds, 90% of which will go to the seventh district and 10% to the eighth district.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Farmers Bank Embezzlement Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wu Heshu, the former manager of the Jiaxing Farmers Bank, was found to have embezzled more than 38,000 yuan after he absconded last autumn. He had sent Xu Shuyi, Tu Yiran, and other staff members to the District Court for trial. The criminal part had already been sentenced. The civil part had been filed with the Civil Court by the bank's current manager, Chen Ruixuan. The court had summoned each defendant for separate trials. On the 24th, the trial continued. The lawyers all appeared in court to defend. After the judge, Chen Dianyou, questioned them one by one, the debate began. After a four-hour trial, the questioner announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 a.m. on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Impersonating County Magistrate Escorts the Fourth Artillery Regiment</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Weixin Hotel had a person pretending to be the newly appointed Haining County Magistrate, Sun Zhihao, a few days ago. Because he did not pay the car fare (he chartered a car from Hangzhou to He, stating that the fare was 40 yuan, to be paid in He), the driver reported it to the police station, who ordered the police to arrest Sun. Multiple notes of fraud were found on his body. After a confidential interrogation by the county government, he was transferred to the Fourth Artillery Regiment stationed in Wei for interrogation because the matter involved impersonating a military officer.</p>
<h3>Allocated Educational Public Bonds Have Been Received</h3>
<p>Jiaxing's education funds have been in arrears for eight months. Teachers and staff from various schools have petitioned the education authorities, but there are no specific solutions due to lack of funds to pay. Recently, the province has decided to allocate public bonds to replenish the educational reserve fund, and the county has been ordered to send personnel to collect them. The county government has sent Shen Dazhuan, the chief of the Education Section, and Yao Jishan, the accountant of the Education Fund Association, to the province to receive public bonds with a face value of 27,800 yuan. However, the Bank of China only allows a 30% discount for borrowing against these bonds, and other banks do not allow borrowing. Under this situation, it can only pay for more than one month's worth of education fees.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Red Pill Criminal Chen Shunfa Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Chen Shunfa, Zhang Guishi, Chen Ayu and three other red pill traffickers, along with four bags of red pills, were sent by the Ningbo Public Security Bureau to the Fifth Special District Administrative Inspector and Military Law Office last month. After questioning and confirming that they were jointly trafficking red pills, the principal offender, Chen Shunfa, was sentenced to death, and the accessories, Zhang Guishi and Chen Ayu, were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. The report was submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. At 1:00 p.m., Chen Shunfa was brought out, his identity was confirmed, and he was tied to Yongning Matou on the north bank of the Jiangbei River and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Another Fire in Jiangdong</h3>
<p>The Yishun Restaurant at No. 133 Donghou Street caught fire accidentally at dawn yesterday. The fire was very fierce and could not be approached. After the fire dragons made great efforts to put out the fire for an hour, it was extinguished. A total of four companies, including Maoji Timber Dream, Sun Kangji Meat Shop, Xunmaohang, and Ji Fruit Shop, suffered losses of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Kong Arrives in Shanghai and Hopes that the People Will Love and Use National Loans and Not Buy a Large Number of Cheap Imported Goods Three Banks Distribute Huge Loans to Rescue Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Beijing by night train at 11:00 p.m. the night before yesterday and arrived at Zhenru at 7:10 yesterday morning, and went straight back to his private residence on West Ames Road for rest. In the afternoon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important official matters and met with reporters to issue the following remarks:</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the people will value the national currency.</p>
<p>According to Kong, it is well known that the United States' increase in the price of silver has affected our country. The reason is that our country does not produce silver and is a country with an import surplus. On the positive side, the price of imported goods should be cheaper than before. On the contrary, the price of exported goods must be more expensive, resulting in a decrease in export power. If imports increase on one side and exports decrease on the other side, the import surplus must be greater. Green international trade originally offset goods through exports. Now, the number of deficiencies is increasing, then the cash that we should pay for foreign goods is increasing. However, I hope that the people of our country will have patriotism, not seek profit, value the national currency, and not exchange it for foreign currency because it is cheap, which will cause the national currency to flow out, and strive to promote the use of domestic goods and not buy a large number of cheap imported goods, then this layer is not enough to be a problem.</p>
<p>The outflow of cash is not worth worrying about</p>
<p>As for the fear that our cash will flow out again due to the surge in silver prices, this is even less of a concern. Now, such as foreign bankers, have a long-term vision and hold a century-long plan. They have already negotiated cooperation with our financial circles and will not export silver. They will never only care about current interests and speculative transactions. This kind of behavior is really not taken by legitimate merchants with a long-term vision. Even if someone intends to sabotage, the government can increase the countervailing duty as an effective response as a last resort.</p>
<p>Three banks distribute 7-8 million</p>
<p>Then, regarding the relief of industry and commerce, now that the four bottoming difficulties have arrived, the suspicions of Zhongjiao and other banks' distribution have exceeded 7-8 million, and the market situation has been greatly stabilized. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the banking side of this matter is still waiting for the Ministry of Finance to designate candidates for the committee to handle the matter. This is a misreport. The huge distribution of loans has already been proven by facts. Is it still necessary to form a committee?</p>
<h3>The United States Continues to Raise Silver Prices: Opinions from the Financial World; Our Nation Must Seek Its Own Way Out by Striving to Remedy the Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that President Roosevelt, yielding to the opinions of pro-silver legislators, continues to vigorously promote the silver policy. Currently, silver prices everywhere are showing a consistent upward trend. According to the speculation of a certain prominent figure in the banking community here, this trend will have little impact on countries with trade surpluses, but will be extremely detrimental to countries with trade deficits. In the past, competition in the commercial arena was entirely based on tangible goods. This later evolved into the buying and selling of stocks. Now, the focus of transactional competition has shifted to intangible currencies. This is truly a distorted development in economics. The intensity of the currency wars among nations can be said to have reached its peak. However, the United States occupies a very important position in the world economy. Therefore, the impact of the US implementing the silver policy will be even greater than that of other countries. The reason why the United States is raising silver prices is, on the one hand, to show goodwill to pro-silver legislators. On the other hand, it also has implications for coping with a world war. If one can gain an economic advantage after a world war breaks out, that is even better than having a military advantage. Moreover, if silver prices are low, the economy will inevitably experience difficulties and tightness during wartime. Thus, the ease with which silver can be distributed, its turnover will be better than that of gold. Therefore, the United States disregards everything else to raise silver prices, implement its silver policy, and attempt to seize the leading position in the world economy, which is inevitable. Hence, the United States continuing to raise silver prices can be said to be a necessary trend. The adverse effects of the silver policy on our nation, and the hope that the United States will abandon the silver policy, are like seeking fish in trees. Currently, China must seek its own way out, and remedying the trade deficit is the most urgent task.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong Will Crack Down on Intentionally Bankrupt Money Houses: Should Be Compensated According to Unlimited Liability Companies, and Those Disrupting Finance Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>A Kuomin News Agency report from Shanghai on the 25th states that a reporter from the agency yesterday met with Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the state of the money industry. He was granted the following statement: Recently, after the Yongxing and Tongtai money houses successively declared bankruptcy, there was slight panic in the money industry. This was subsequently stabilized by the continued interbank lending of the Three Banks. From yesterday onwards, the situation has been steadily improving. Therefore, there should be no problems with the end of the April term. However, money houses in our country have always occupied an important position in finance. It is only because they have been accustomed to outdated organizational structures and have made few improvements that they have given cause for criticism. Unexpectedly, in recent times, there have been several money houses that, upon investigation, were actually not impossible to maintain, but have intentionally declared bankruptcy. They then perfunctorily deal with all creditor and debtor issues with a liquidator. Such behavior is tantamount to fraud and is a scourge on society, and should be strictly cracked down upon. If the above situation occurs again, in addition to being required to fully compensate creditors as an unlimited liability company, they should also be given punishments for disrupting finance. The manager of a money house is like the captain of a ship. If a storm is encountered, the captain must do everything possible to struggle. If the ship is beyond saving, the captain should be the last to abandon ship, thereby fulfilling their duty. However, recently, when money house managers encounter difficulties, they first try to evade responsibility. Some even abscond with funds. This situation is particularly hateful. In the future, the government will severely punish such behavior to warn the cunning and preserve the rights of depositors.</p>
<h3>US Economic Survey Mission Flew from Nanjing Back to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon: Praises Rapid Progress in the Capital's Construction; Dinner Hosted by Mayor Wu in the Evening</h3>

After disembarking, the members exchanged pleasantries with the welcoming party, praised the scenery along the way, and the speed of the plane. They then boarded six cars prepared by the reception office and returned to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest.</p>
<p>Head of Mission Speaks</p>
<p>After disembarking, Mr. Forbes, the head of the mission, gave a statement to the Central News Agency, saying, "Although this trip to Nanjing was only for a day and a half, we have met with all the government authorities of your esteemed nation and have had a glimpse of most of the major buildings. All aspects of the capital's construction have shown significant progress. Especially the area around the mausoleum is scenically elegant, which is very enviable. I visited Nanjing once 14 years ago. I feel that today's rapidly progressing capital is incomparable to what it was in the past."</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>Last night at 8:00 PM, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for the US Economic Survey Mission at the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. In addition to all the mission members and their families, also invited were Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the US Far East Fleet, US Consul General Cunningham, US Judge Advocate General Hallmut, Commander of the US Marine Corps Barmen, US Consul General Davis, US Commercial Counselor Arnold, all consuls from the US Consulate General in Shanghai, about 80 leaders from the US banking and business communities, Mr. and Mrs. Gu Shaochuan, Mr. and Mrs. Zhu Changnian, Mr. and Mrs. Yan Nanning, Miss Gan Shuxian, Mr. and Mrs. Sun Zhongli, Mr. and Mrs. Li Guangzhao, Mr. and Mrs. Wen Yuqing, Mr. and Mrs. Li Fuxun, Mr. and Mrs. Zhi Songsun, Guo Shun, Yang Guangxing, Mr. and Mrs. Yu Hongjun, Yu Ming, Zhao Tiezhang, Zhang Gongquan, Guo Bingwen, Chen Zheqing, Mr. and Mrs. Pan Guangdi, Mr. and Mrs. Yu Zuoting, Xu Xinliu, He Bingxian, Li Zhaohuan, Wang Boqi, Mr. and Mrs. Cao Yunxiang, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Dajun, He Dekui, Mr. and Mrs. Zou Bingwen, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Liting, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Xiangtao, Xia Xiaofang, Lu Shoulian, Mr. and Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Mr. and Mrs. Wei Xianzhang, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Xianlin, Chen Bingzhang, Mr. and Mrs. Wang Ertao, Mr. and Mrs. Guo Dehua, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Zhanen, Dai Enji, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, and 60 to 70 others.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Mayor Wu rose to deliver a welcome speech, saying, "Mr. Forbes, members of the US Economic Survey Mission, and everyone, the US Economic Survey Mission is here to inspect China, passing through Shanghai. I, as the mayor, am honored to have this opportunity to express my sincere welcome. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to shake hands with the members of your mission and learn of your spirit of amity. Today, we meet again, and I would like to wish you all a pleasant trip and success in your mission. Our people have always regarded the words 'United States' as representing 'fairness' and 'justice.' The relationship between China and the United States in the past has been a long history full of friendship and mutual assistance. I am confident that the mission you bear on this visit to Shanghai will certainly lead to an increasing friendship between the two great nations. Shanghai is not only the commercial center of China, but also has a close relationship with the world's economic development. On the one hand, it is very quickly affected by foreign economic conditions. On the other hand, it very clearly reflects the situation in the interior. And the Chinese interior is the ultimate market for foreign goods. I have heard that the mission of your delegation is specifically to investigate the facts. And the investigation of facts is the greatest hope we have for all of you. We know very well that you can embrace a broad mind, far-sighted vision, and the mind of a practical politician to observe things. The result will certainly be the solution of all difficult problems. If, during your investigation in Shanghai, you give a correct interpretation of all the phenomena here, the success of your mission will surely be achieved with half the effort. Moreover, our country will benefit greatly and learn from your country. However, at the same time, it often has its own slight contributions. I recently spoke with members of your mission and learned that there are many who hold this view. If we can fully understand this point, it is as if we have obtained the secret to success in sincere cooperation. If we follow the principles of mutual respect and mutual assistance, I dare to believe that in our efforts to reduce the phenomenon of economic downturn, we can obtain great assistance. Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to express our best wishes to the members of the US Economic Survey Mission and offer a toast."</p>
<p>Head of Mission's Reply</p>
<p>Following Mayor Wu, Mr. Forbes, the head of the US Economic Survey Mission, rose to give a speech in reply and thank you. He said that the members of the mission were honored to receive the warm hospitality of the government authorities and business leaders of your esteemed nation during this visit to China. The various investigation works are currently underway in order to further promote the prosperity of trade between the two countries. He expressed great gratitude for the assistance and guidance received from all sectors, and wished everyone present good health.</p>

<h3>Two Loan Cases of 20 Million Yuan: Methods Can Be Determined This Morning; Shanghai Money Market Sets Inner Rate at 5.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>A report from the Kuomin News Agency states that the end-of-April settlement period is fast approaching, and the market situation has gradually stabilized. Businesses can generally pass through this difficult period safely, and the methods for the two loan cases of 20 million yuan can also be determined by the Central Bank's board of directors after taking office today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Methods to Be Determined Today</p>
<p>The measures for the mortgage loan of 15 million yuan and the small-scale industrial and commercial credit loan of 5 million yuan, organized by the Ministry of Finance, the Central, China, and Communications Banks, together with the Shanghai Bankers Association, have been drafted by Xi Demao of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications, etc. They will be proposed at 10:00 AM this morning, taking advantage of the inauguration of the new board of directors of the Central Bank, for final discussion in order to start the process. The Central Bank bears more responsibility for the distribution of this loan (for example, in the 5 million yuan credit small loan, the Bank Association only contributes 1 million yuan from the Bank of China, 400,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, and a total of 485,000 yuan from other banks. The remaining amount must be borne by the Central Bank). Moreover, the president of the bank is the Minister of Finance, so the final decision must be made by the bank.</p>
<p>Three Banks' Interbank Lending: No Requests Yesterday</p>
<p>There were no requests for interbank lending from the Central, China, and Communications Banks yesterday, except for applications for extensions and a small number of redemptions of mortgaged items. This is a sign that the money market is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>Money Industry Association: Agreed on Inner Rate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association convened its 38th Executive Committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Qin Runqing, Li Shoushan, Zheng Bingquan, Chen Shengwu, Pei Yunqing, Qian Yuansheng, Liu Wuqiao, Xi Jiming, Wang Huailian, Sheng Xiaoshan, Zhang Mengzhou, Shao Yanshan, and 12 others. Qin Runqing chaired the meeting and reported on the following matters: (abridged) Matters for discussion: (1) Regarding the setting of inner rates for interbank transactions (also known as the 'sitting rate,' which is the minimum interest rate for interbank overdrafts, previously 4.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan per month), it was decided to set it at 5.5 yuan. (2) Regarding the order from the Social Affairs Bureau to open the inner garden, it was decided that the matter concerns the overall scope and should be submitted to the regular meeting of member representatives on May 2nd for discussion. Other motions were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tighter Credit: Higher Foreign Rates</p>
<p>As the end of April quickly approaches, collections and settlements are frequent, and credit is inevitably tighter. Yesterday, foreign rates rose by two points, both morning and afternoon, to 1.2 fen. According to a money industry insider who spoke to the reporter, it is difficult for the industry to make a uniform decision on extensions or settlements for the long-term settlement at the end of April. This matter can only be decided by each house based on its own circumstances and the situation of its debtors, and to separately decide whether to extend or settle.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Arriving in Shanghai This Morning</h3>

<h3>Our Authorities Will Urge the Siamese Government to Improve the Treatment of Overseas Chinese: Plan to Order Minister Jiang to Negotiate a Trade Treaty</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that various parties here are paying close attention to the various harsh regulations promulgated by the Siamese authorities for our overseas Chinese. It is reported that there are more than 3 million Chinese living in Siam, and the commercial relations between the two countries are also very close. In particular, the amount of Siamese rice imported into China each year is considerable. Siam's implementation of such harsh regulations on our overseas Chinese will not only have adverse effects on commercial relations between the two countries, but will also be extremely detrimental to the overall national relations. Our authorities have indeed received reports of such mistreatment of overseas Chinese. However, since the two countries are geographically adjacent and have very close ethnic relations, the Chinese living in that country have now formally requested the government authorities to use proper procedures to urge the authorities of that country to improve treatment. Therefore, in addition to making goodwill inquiries to the authorities of that country, our government authorities will also order Jiang Zuobin, the minister stationed in Japan, to be responsible for negotiating a trade treaty between the two countries, as the two countries have not yet established such a treaty, so as to establish proper relations between the two countries.</p>

<h3>Art Exhibition - 18th Day of Pre-Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) was the 18th day of the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London. There were about 2,000 visitors, a quarter of whom were group ticket holders. Recently, many requests have been made by various schools, academic, artistic, and cultural organizations for discounted tickets and the scheduling of visits. The organizing committee is arranging dates in order of request and has already scheduled up to the 30th of this month. As the exhibition is scheduled to close on the 30th, and groups from afar are unable to come to Shanghai to visit before the closing date, they fear missing the opportunity and have requested an extension of the exhibition. The organizing committee has received many such requests recently. However, the antiquities are scheduled to be shipped to England on May 28th, and the closing process will also take time. The possibility of extending the exhibition to fulfill the hopes of those from afar is under consideration by the organizing committee. The Chinese catalogs printed by the committee have been selling very well recently, and the remaining stock is low. Negotiations are underway with the Commercial Press to reprint them. Furthermore, to ensure the timely dissemination of information, the committee contacted the local Ministry of Transportation broadcasting station yesterday to arrange for staff to broadcast news from the exhibition venue daily or every other day. This will allow those from afar who cannot visit Shanghai to understand the general condition of the exhibited antiquities. Additionally, the exhibition showcases a large number of antiquities, and visits take time. To facilitate rest for visitors, extra sofas and chairs have been placed in open spaces, along with a rest room for relaxation.</p>
<p>Explanation of Selected Archaeological Items</p>
<p>The "Explanation of Selected Archaeological Items" using oracle bones, oracle bone script, and deer head inscriptions was described in yesterday's newspaper. Here we will list the explanations for stone knives, stone axes, and hairpins: (4) Stone Knives: Stone knives were the most common daily utensils made of stone in the Yin Ruins. Over a hundred complete, undamaged examples have been unearthed, and the number of broken ones is several times greater. The stone material is mostly slate or sandstone. Ten examples with different shapes have been selected, with the first seven being relatively common and the latter seven being extremely rare, perhaps remnants of the Stone Age. (5) Stone Axes: Stone axes from the Yin Ruins can generally be divided into two categories: those with holes and those without. Each category can be further divided into several types based on their shape. It seems that only one type was commonly used, while the others may be early remnants or ritual objects used during sacrifices and dances. The six selected examples include only one that is relatively common, while the rest are unique. (6) Hairpins: Tradition holds that shapes were carved on the ends of hairpins, presumably based on some evidence. Many bone hairpins unearthed from the Yin Ruins have chicken shapes carved on them, and their shapes vary greatly. The six selected examples represent relatively common hairpin shapes, all made of bone. (To be continued tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Letter from Taoist Qianyin</p>
<p>A visitor, signing himself Qianyin Taoist, submitted a letter to the exhibition, stating his impressions: "The pre-exhibition of the London Art Exhibition has been open in Shanghai for over ten days. I was invited once and have purchased tickets myself to visit several times. I would like to share my impressions below. The arrangement of exhibits in each display room is generally in chronological order, making it easy to see the stages of evolution of our national art, which is quite scientific and commendable. Rather than calling it a 'pre-exhibition,' it would be more accurate to call it a comprehensive review of art history. Those studying art, of course, must see it, but those studying history and other social sciences must also see it. Bronzes range from the Shang and Zhou dynasties down to the Qin and Han dynasties, porcelain from the Song and Yuan dynasties down to the Ming and Qing dynasties, and embroidery also started in the Song dynasty and ended in the Qing dynasty. The closer to our era, the more exquisite, and the farther away, the more simple and crude. From an artistic point of view, although progress is slow, it is indeed moving forward. From a historical point of view, we can imagine the lives of our ancestors and the order of civilization's evolution. For example, in the bronze ware room, there is a Shang Dynasty 'Xian' (number 003) which resembles a ding tripod, with fat, hollow legs that can hold water. The upper section resembles the upper part of a ding, with a copper plate with many perforations in the middle. This copper plate can be lifted at will, presumably an ancient tool used to steam food, essentially a combination of the steamer and steaming basket we use at home today. The ingenuity of our ancestors four thousand years ago is astounding. Even today, we cannot escape the scope of our predecessors' thinking, which is both surprising and shameful. In the calligraphy and painting display room, there are many paintings but few examples of calligraphy. Over 90% are paintings. Judging from paintings alone, Tang paintings are simple and archaic, outlining contours that are as deep as carvings, which is inevitably too clear and too rigid, perhaps what is meant by 'prevailing with bone strength but not showing grace.' Song paintings gradually became more lively, with both form and spirit, endlessly varied, and far beyond what the Tang people could have imagined. The poem 'Do not belittle modern people and praise ancient people' makes sense. I have the same feeling about the paintings of the Tang and Song dynasties. Yuan paintings are increasingly refined, with all six principles reaching their peak. Ming and Qing painters, although willing to work hard, only followed in the footsteps of their predecessors, never opening up new paths, always jumping within the circle of Song and Yuan painters, and their spiritual strength feels weaker than their predecessors, with a clear downward trend. This is likely due to only knowing how to imitate and not knowing how to create. But this is based on periods. If we were to judge based on individual artists, some Ming and Qing painters can rival those of the Song and Yuan dynasties, but these are few. Based on my personal observation, if I may make a sweeping judgment, I would evaluate Chinese paintings from the Tang and Song dynasties onward as follows: from the Tang to the Yuan dynasties, painting progressed day by day, and the rate of advancement was astonishing. From the Yuan to the Qing dynasties, painting degenerated day by day, and the degree of decline was pitiful. If others don't believe me, they can spend two yuan, or one yuan if they join an academic organization, to visit the exhibition and see for themselves that my argument is not nonsense and is not without basis. The evolution and changes of Chinese characters are not found in the calligraphy and painting room, but can be glimpsed by comprehensively linking together the inscriptions on the bronze ding and yi vessels in the bronze ware room, the oracle bone inscriptions in the archaeological room, the Six Dynasties scripture writing, the few album leaves in the calligraphy and painting room, and the inscriptions on the paintings. I asked the staff why they did not collect rubbings of bronze inscriptions, famous calligraphic models, and the works of famous calligraphers of past dynasties in one room for systematic display to allow scholars of writing to study them. They replied that the exhibits were to be sent to London for exhibition. Few Westerners study Oriental writing and cannot appreciate it, so they were not selected. The ancient books listed in the ancient book display room start with Six Dynasties manuscripts and end with Qing Dynasty printed books. Looking only at the printed books, the earliest is the Five Dynasties engraved scripture discovered after the collapse of the Leifeng Pagoda. From this, one can see the stages of evolution of printing, which is that the closer to our era, the more refined. Common archaeologists and collectors always say that the older the block-printed edition, the more valuable it is, but that has a different meaning. Everyone has a different perspective, so their observations are also different. Movable type printing was first invented in our country and is called Jūzhēn edition, which our people often boast about. There are two types of Ming Dynasty movable type books on display in this room. The printing is excellent and truly rare. The Ming Dynasty woodblock printing of five-color painting manuals shows the depth of shade, and contrast of light and dark. It is unexpected that hundreds of years before the invention of five-color collotype printing, such exquisite products existed. The effort that went into them is truly astonishing. It is a pity that they are placed in glass cabinets, allowing only a glimpse and not allowing people to browse through them. In short, from this exhibition, we can see that our nation is indeed willing to work hard and is extremely intelligent. However, in certain periods, progress was very rapid, while in other periods, there was little progress, or even regression. If we can have a consistent spirit and continue to work hard, the success will not only be like this."</p>
<p>Groups Visiting Yesterday</p>
<p>The groups that visited yesterday morning included more than ten teachers and students from National Tongji University (led by Professor Wang Yuzhang), more than thirty teachers and students from Guanghua University, more than forty students from Xinhua Art College, more than ten teachers and students from Huadong Girls' High School (led by Principal Ma Jiazhen), more than thirty members of the Wanmi Mountain House Calligraphy and Painting Society, and more than ten members of the White Crane Painting Society.

<h3>Social Bureau Instructs Chamber of Commerce - to Select Academic Workers - Can Contact National Advisory Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau yesterday instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: "According to the instruction from the Ministry of Industry, the letter No. 754 from the National Academic Work Advisory Office states that the First Employment Guidance Committee of this Office has decided that this Office should first contact and liaise with various administrative and industrial and commercial agencies and trade associations in various places, requesting them to give priority to selecting the academic personnel introduced by this Office and keep records on file. Since national industrial and commercial agencies and trade associations in various places are all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, it is necessary to promote and encourage the absorption of talent for industry and the promotion of talent to achieve significant results. Therefore, we request that you instruct your subordinate agencies to instruct various chambers of commerce, trade unions, trade associations, and factories to inform this Office of the status of academic workers needed at any time in the future. Once introduced by this Office, they should be employed as much as possible, so that people can be matched with the right jobs. The Ministry agrees with this proposal. In addition to issuing separate orders, this is hereby ordered for your information and to instruct your subordinates to be informed, etc. This order is hereby given to the Chamber for your information and to instruct your subordinates to be informed, etc."</p>

<h3>Federation of Citizens of the Second Special District Sends Representatives to French Consul-General to Demand Six Items - Written Statements on All Points Concern the Interests of Citizens - French Consul-General Agrees to Consider and Handle After Meeting</h3>
<p>New News Agency reports that the Federation of Citizens of the Second Special District of Shanghai in the French Concession, because the French authorities often arbitrarily search residents without following legal procedures, causing citizens to live in constant fear and anxiety, has sent a letter to Consul-General Baudrez of France requesting prompt action. The federation also elected five directors, including Mao Yun, to personally deliver the letter and request handling. Consul-General Baudrez personally received them and agreed to consider the letter and then handle it. The original text of the letter is recorded below: "Respectfully to the French Consul-General, according to a joint report from the sub-associations of the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth districts, the market has been sluggish recently, industrial and commercial enterprises have gone bankrupt, and the suffering of citizens has reached its extreme. However, the concession authorities not only do not think of remedies, but also arbitrarily increase donations, add taxes, and impose fines. If citizens do not comply slightly, they are threatened with stopping water and electricity. Furthermore, since the recovery of French rights in the Second Special District, the police have never observed the spirit of judicial independence in our country. For example, when searching residents, they have never obtained search warrants from the court, which is a serious infringement of legal rights. The members of the association have suffered unbearably and request that your consulate promptly convene a meeting to discuss remedies to reassure the citizens." After investigation, the matters mentioned by the district associations are indeed true. Therefore, the sixth plenary meeting of the directors of the association decided to propose the following points for your Consul-General to review and implement: 1. The police should obtain a search warrant from the court when searching residents. Recently, on the night of February 12, at about 8 p.m., Chinese Inspector Qian Chenglong of the police force, without a search warrant, led a large number of detectives to Wang Shunxing Wood Shop at No. 206 Pingji Road, claiming to be catching gambling. Inspector Qian Chenglong used a pistol to threaten apprentice Wang Wenqing, forcing him to confess that Dong Wenli opened a gambling den. The next day, they went to Dong's house to search and sent detectives to monitor it, falsely accusing them of gambling. This situation is extremely illegal. The details have been sent to your Consul-General for investigation and handling, but many days have passed without a reply. We request that you refer to the previous letter and handle it promptly. 2. Recently, the police have fined shops for slight non-compliance. Recently, the Yongmao Coal Shop at No. 94 Gubal Road, the warehouse at No. 106 on the same road, and the warehouses at No. 782 and 793 Julida Road were ordered to relocate within eight days and were fined 15 yuan. Since the shop's separate warehouses have not violated any regulations or engaged in illegal activities, how can they be arbitrarily fined and forced to relocate? This situation is obviously intended to disrupt business. We request that you instruct your subordinates to stop it promptly to reassure merchants and residents. 3. There are regulations for business taxes, but now the authorities arbitrarily increase donations and add taxes. If they are not satisfied slightly, they threaten to stop water and electricity. Recently, the Jusunyishi Sauce Garden at No. 187 Ximen Road had its original wine tax of 2.8 yuan increased to 7 yuan by the French Public Works Bureau in September last year. After negotiations, the chief of the bureau personally investigated and canceled the increase. The tax collector collected the accumulated original tax (2.8 yuan per month) for four months. In January of this year, the wine tax was not collected. On February 28, the bureau suddenly sent a letter stating that the monthly wine tax was set at 5 yuan, totaling 10 yuan for January and February, and demanded payment within three days, or water and electricity would be cut off. The shop refused to admit the unreasonable increase in taxes. Unexpectedly, the French Public Works Bureau cut off water and electricity on March 25. How can merchants operate under such pressure and coercion? We request that you order the bureau to cancel the increase in taxes and immediately restore water and electricity to benefit merchants. 4. Recently, bandits have been rampant, robbing in broad daylight. Recently, the Xieshunxiang Cotton Cloth Shop on Caishi Street was robbed twice, on the evening of January 13 and at 6 p.m. on the evening of March 10, suffering heavy losses. Since the shop is located in the center of the concession and the time was in the evening, the bandits dared to openly rob, which is obviously due to insufficient security. We request that you order the police to strictly pursue and arrest the bandits and add more posts in various places to strengthen security. 5. Jai alai and dog racing are disguised gambling, which harms the people through speculation. We request that you explicitly prohibit and effectively ban them to benefit the people's livelihood. 6. In the past, the concession authorities have rarely replied to official letters from this association and its district associations. We request that you instruct your subordinates to clearly reply to all past requests. The above points are all important issues that need to be resolved urgently. We have specially elected five directors, Mao Yun, Wang Shunfa, Li Weiliang, Qu Zhenhua, and Zhu Wenqi, to meet with you in person. We hope that your Consul-General will investigate and handle them, and we look forward to your reply. Sincerely, to Baudrez, French Consul-General in Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Martyrs' Cemetery to Be Completed - Tomb House and Monument Completed - Memorial Archway to Be Completed in Half a Month</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Martyrs' Cemetery in Changgouwan Town is where the remains of military personnel and civilians who died in the Shanghai War are buried, totaling more than 1,300 bodies.</p>
<p>The collection and burial work was carried out by Cai Weizhang and Lu Chengyu, directors of the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall. The cost of coffins and burial was donated by Wang Weiguan, a Ningbo businessman in Shanghai. The hall then raised funds to build a monument in front of the tomb to honor the loyal souls (the construction cost was generously donated by Yan Enxiang, the former director of the Shanghai Office).</p>
<p>A memorial archway, a tomb house, all the above buildings were designed by engineer Quan Yuanren voluntarily. It has been a long time since the start of construction. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of February this year. However, due to limited funds, the progress of the project was inevitably delayed. Yesterday, a reporter from the Datong News Agency went to the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall to inquire and learned that the tomb house construction has been completed.</p>
<p>The construction of the monument has also been completed, and only the inscription needs to be engraved. However, the memorial archway, due to the large scale of the project, will not be completed until half a month later. The memorial inscription was written by Shen Wushi and the characters were written by Yuan Zhonglian. The full text of the</p>
<p>Monument Inscription is transcribed below: "On January 28, 1932, the Japanese army invaded Zhabei and attacked Wusong, exhausting all their efforts but failing to succeed. They then gathered troops in Jiangwan and ordered a general attack on January 20. In our Jiangwan territory, prosperous towns and densely populated villages were reduced to scorched earth in less than ten days. Alas, how cruel! In mid-March, the war had just ended. Cai Weizhang and Lu Chengyu, directors of Chongshan Hall, could not bear to see the bodies of anti-Japanese soldiers and fallen compatriots lying everywhere. Therefore, they organized a burial team, raised funds, selected personnel, and drew up plans, working tirelessly day and night. Even with the enemy's harsh orders and restrictions, they did not waver in their progress, exposing themselves to danger. In the winter of that year, they opened up more than nine acres of public land in Changgouwan, north of the town, and collected and buried those who had been temporarily buried in the suburbs, imitating the new European and American system, to comfort the loyal souls. Two years later, they raised funds to build a memorial archway, build a tomb house, open up thoroughfares, and decorate with flowers and trees. The entire project was completed. The sacrifices of the people in the January 28th War were great, and the survival of the nation depended on it. Only by strengthening the outlook can we inspire public will and seek to wash away the humiliation. How can we, who came after, be regarded merely as covering up bones with benevolence? In this war, 1,300 bodies were buried, not including those buried in the Guangzhao Villa. More than 15,000 yuan was spent. Yan Enbiao donated 500 yuan for the monument, and Wang Weiguan donated more than 10,000 yuan for burial expenses. Their sincerity in public welfare and their leading advocacy are admirable. The other gentlemen who contributed and donated money are not listed here for now. Respectfully written by Shen Wushi, a local resident, in the year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Strictly Prohibits Obscene Plays - Little World Repeatedly Performs Obscene Plays - Receives Severe Punishment and Finally Closes</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports that Little World in the city has been established for many years and is the only amusement park in Nanshi. Its closure was reported in yesterday's newspaper due to poor business. According to information from a Shanghai News Agency reporter, the reason for its closure is that the Siming opera performed by the park was obscene. The Education Bureau warned and prohibited the performance, but it continued to be performed from the 1st of this month, with increased intensity. The park completely displayed secret acts between men and women on stage. The Education Bureau discovered that these obscene plays had a very bad impact on society. The Education Bureau notified the Public Security Bureau to arrest all the actors in the Siming opera and the person in charge of Little World, sentencing them to ten days in prison. The owner of the park then announced its closure.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Huangpu River - Two Suicide Notes Saying He Cannot Strive - But How Does He Have the Courage to Commit Suicide?</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, after the ferry leaving the pier on Beijing Road departed, while traveling in the center of the Huangpu River, a young passenger suddenly left two suicide notes and jumped into the Huangpu River. The sailors discovered this immediately and reported it to the captain, who stopped the engine to rescue him. However, it seemed that the young man was carrying heavy objects. After entering the water, he did not surface, making rescue impossible. The captain handed the suicide notes to Xu Zhaozhen, an employee of the Municipal Ferry, who forwarded them to the Customs Water Police Station. The police found that one suicide note was addressed to his parents and the other to a friend. The words were extremely sad. They are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Dear Parents, don't be sad. Please transfer your hopes to my three younger brothers. This suicide is a last resort. I have committed such a cruel act, dying recklessly. Dad, I have harmed you. Dad, I really can't write anymore. All the words are buried in my stomach to die. If I say them, it will only make you more sad. Mom and Dad, please take care of yourselves. My younger brothers will restore the family's glory. Then I will be smiling in the afterlife. Farewell, goodbye forever. Mom and Dad, I wish you good health. Sincerely, Yun Shen.</p>
<p>(2) Old friend Qi, "It is better to strive to the end than to have the courage to commit suicide." These are the words we encouraged each other with. Alas, Qi, when you can't strive, what can you do? Only suicide. Old friend, don't be sad. See you in the next life. Please, Miss ×, forward my regards on my behalf. Goodbye forever, Qi, I wish you courage, Yun Shen.</p>
<p>After investigation by the police detectives, it was learned that the deceased was from Suzhou, 20 years old, and worked at the Shanghai Dazhong Mining Company. His colleagues did not fully understand the reason for his suicide. His friends have sent people to salvage the body, waiting for his family to arrive to collect it for burial.</p>
<h3>Xiang Sheng Automobile: Driver Accusation Trial Begins; Bail Set at 500 Yuan per Defendant; Xiang Sheng Automobile Resumes Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Following the strike initiated by a majority of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company drivers on the 11th of this month, drivers Lang A’gen and others secretly met on the 17th in Room 405 of the Da Zhong Hotel in the French Concession to discuss countermeasures. This was detected by Chinese detectives Yang Dechun and Xu Dezhong of the Lao Zha Patrol, who, together with French Concession detectives Fu Fengh Heng and He Yaohai, apprehended 15 individuals, including Qiu and others. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. Except for Qiu Yongwan, Zhou Liangmin, Mao Jinbing, Li Zhongyue, Jiang Jilin, and Chen Zhuxin, who were released due to lack of involvement, the rest were remanded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division continued the hearing. Patrol lawyer Wang Yaotang charged the six defendants, Qiu A’gen, Xiao Ziyou, Chen Ronglin, Han A’lin, Xu Gengsheng, and Cai A’dong, with obstructing freedom under Article 319 of the criminal law, alleging they used intimidation to prevent Zhang Ruizhang, Pan Zenghua, and others from working. Additionally, Cai A’dong, Jiang A’ning, Gan Xinchang, and Zhang Fangxin were charged with assault under Article 294 of the criminal law, accusing them of beating Russian bodyguard Mike Lao Fu of Xiang Sheng Company near Longhua on April 12th at 5 PM. Mike identified them, requesting legal punishment. Subsequently, Zhou Xiangsheng (manager of Xiang Sheng Company) submitted a petition detailing the cause of the strike, stating that driver Yang Jinsheng was labeled as a company "stooge" by colleagues Yin Xuanqi, Chen Songlin, and Xu Jinsheng. On the 28th of last month at 2 AM, they brutally assaulted Yang, causing severe injuries. Zhou dismissed all four. However, a majority immediately demanded reinstatement, which Zhou refused. Unexpectedly, on the 11th of this month, Yin Xuanqi and the other two drove to various branches, coercing a strike. Upon hearing this, Zhou convened all drivers, advising them against it. He specifically instructed Qiu A’gen, identified as a leader, to prevent the strike. However, Qiu led a group away, leading to the strike. After Judge Feng questioned the defendants, he ordered a postponement. Bail was set at 500 yuan per defendant. It is reported that Xiang Sheng Company fully resumed operations yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Yong An Xiang Coconut Oil: Accused of Evading Taxes and Duties totaling 2,050 Gold Yuan; Defendant Claims to Have Fully Declared to Customs Broker</h3>
<p>Yong An Xiang National Goods Store at No. 2 Tongde Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession, specializing in import and export of various goods. The main import is coconut oil produced in Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia, shipped to Shanghai, and then distributed to other ports and inland areas. It is mainly used by various soap factories as raw material for soap production. The manager is Yong Jinqingbiao, 53 years old. Recently, the Jianghai Customs found that the store imported 200 barrels of coconut oil in January of the 21st year, with taxes and duties due totaling 2,216.28 gold yuan. Only 166.28 gold yuan were paid at the time, evading taxes and duties amounting to 2,050 gold yuan. The customs accused the store of altering the bill of lading and fraudulently taking delivery of the goods and sent a letter to the French Concession patrol for investigation. Upon receiving the letter, the patrol sent detectives on the 19th of this month to summon Jiang Qingbiao, the manager of Yong An Xiang, for investigation, and then transferred him to Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special District Court. After interrogation by Judge Qiu Huan Ying, it was decided that the case should be handled by the Local Court. Jiang was ordered to provide a 5,000 yuan bond, pending rescheduling and transfer to the Local Court for hearing. At 11 AM yesterday morning, Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu of Criminal Court No. 1 held a hearing. Defendant Jiang Qingbiao and his defense lawyers appeared in court. First, patrol lawyer Yuan Jiahuan presented the case, charging the defendant with forgery and fraud under Article 233 and Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Defendant Jiang Qingbiao testified that he had been the manager of Yong An Xiang for four years. Normally, the import and export tax payment procedures of the store were handled by Xin Cheng Customs Broker at No. 12 Rede Lane, Zilai Street. The merchant was unable to directly declare taxes to customs. All the coconut oil taxes and duties imported in January of the 21st year were fully paid to Xin Cheng Customs Broker for transfer to customs. Xin Cheng Customs Broker closed down in the first half of last year. He knew nothing about whether they evaded taxes or duties. After this incident, he sent a partner, Shen Qing, to find Hu Xizhuang, the manager of Xin Cheng Customs Broker, and accompanied him to the patrol, but the patrol did not interrogate him and released Hu immediately. Whether taxes and duties were evaded should be the responsibility of the customs broker. There were ledgers available to check what taxes had been paid by his store, and the ledgers had already been handed over to the patrol. Subsequently, the defendant's defense lawyers Yang Linkun, Yuan Han, and Yao Fuyuan spoke successively, stating that the French Concession patrol did not investigate or interrogate Hu Xizhuang, the key person in the case, and released him immediately. Moreover, there were witnesses to Hu's visit to the patrol. It was strange that the patrol report stated that Hu could not be summoned, and it was unknown on what grounds the accusation was made. The defendant entrusted Xin Cheng Customs Broker to handle everything at that time, and all responsibilities were borne by the customs broker. The customs also trusted the customs broker. Yong An Xiang only relied on the statements from Xin Cheng Customs Broker to pay taxes and duties, and the customs broker transferred them to customs. Now the ledgers of the defendant's store had been impounded by the patrol. Two receipts for taxes and duties paid to Xin Cheng Customs Broker could be found on the ledgers. Why didn't the patrol submit these ledgers to the court so that the facts could be clarified? The court should order the patrol to submit the ledgers to the court. At this point, the court summoned the patrol detectives in charge of the case, but neither the Chinese nor Western detectives appeared. The judge considered that the case still needed investigation, and ordered a rescheduling to the morning of the 30th for further questioning. He instructed the patrol detectives in charge to summon Hu Xizhuang for questioning at the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Monk Steals Check, Fraudulently Withdraws Deposit, Exposes Himself to the Law Again; Shameless Person in Religious Orders</h3>
<p>Haiyin, a monk from Ningbo, 38 years old, was a guest teacher at the Xuantong Temple at No. 687 Zhoujiazui Road. Around the 10th of this month, taking advantage of the abbot, Lao Seng Lingyan, seeing a guest out, he secretly took a paper check stub No. 3296526 from the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank from the table, stamped it with his own small seal, and went to the Tilanqiao branch to withdraw two yuan. Because the name on the seal was incorrect, it was not given. Haiyin then paid five jiao at a seal engraving shop at No. 806 East Xihua Road to have a seal engraved in the same style as Lingyan's, and added it to the check. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the bank again to withdraw the money, when he was detected and Haiyin was detained. He was handed over to Chinese detective Sun Aizhong, along with the check, and taken to the Huishan Patrol Station for detention. Yesterday, he was escorted to Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department presented the previous situation and requested investigation. The check was presented for inspection. Lingyan, the old monk, stated that the defendant had torn a paper from the check at the time, and he did not pay attention and did not know. When questioned, Haiyin confessed that he was ill and had no money for treatment, so he resorted to this strategy and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Prostitution Robbery Case Verdict: Ruan Zilin Sentenced to Four Years and Eight Months</h3>
<p>Famous prostitute Hongfu Lao Jiu, on the evening of April 8th, was lured by bandit Ruan Zilin and his accomplices Lu Jianying and Li Jianguang (alias Wang) to Room 523 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. After being drugged and losing consciousness, they robbed her of her gold bracelet and jade ring, pawned them, and divided the proceeds before fleeing without a trace. After the prostitute regained consciousness, she reported to the patrol and requested an investigation. Detective Ruan Taibin went to Suzhou and captured Ruan. Ruan confessed that Lu and Li were hiding in Zhabei, and they were subsequently arrested. Liu Jiaji, a doctor, was falsely implicated by Ruan, who claimed that Liu had provided the drugs. As a result, Liu was also arrested. When the case was brought to the First Special District Court for investigation, Liu hired lawyer Zhang Baotang to appear in court to clarify the false accusation. The judge understood the situation and allowed Liu to be released on bail. The three defendants, Ruan, Lu, and Li, were remanded pending judgment. Yesterday morning was the date for the verdict to be announced. The patrol escorted Ruan and others to the court. Liu Jiaji, accompanied by his defense lawyer Zhang Baotang, appeared in court. Lawyer Li Zhishan, representing the patrol, also appeared in court. At 9:00 AM, Judge Jiang Shuzi took the seat in Criminal Court No. 3, briefly questioned the defendants, and then announced the verdict: Ruan Zilin was sentenced to imprisonment for four years and eight months. Lu Jianying and Li Jianguang were each sentenced to imprisonment for three years and six months. Liu Jiaji was found not guilty. After the sentencing, except for Liu who left on his own, the three convicts Ruan and others were taken back to the patrol station for detention, pending confirmation before being sent to Tilanqiao Prison to serve their sentences.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Work to Begin on May 1st; Requesting Assistance from Concession Health Authorities; Special Agreements with Hospitals for Free Injections</h3>
<p>Given the imminent arrival of summer, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau deems it necessary to prepare for epidemic prevention as early as possible. A decision has been made to commence work from May 1st. Besides requesting assistance from the health authorities of the two Concessions, the Bureau is also actively preparing everything. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing Injection Teams: The Bureau will organize injection teams to administer vaccinations in various locations. All publicity materials related to epidemic prevention vaccinations are ready. Starting May 1st, four injection teams will be formed initially, each consisting of a doctor and a nurse. They will first go to various schools for injections, aiming to complete the work before the summer vacation. Then, they will proceed to factories, organizations, and groups for injections. From June 1st, the number of injection teams will be expanded to eight, and they will administer injections to travelers at railway stations and docks. Along the way, they will cooperate with the Public Security Bureau to enforce mandatory injections.</p>
<p>Special Agreements with Hospitals: To make injections accessible, the Bureau has special agreements with various hospitals to provide free injections to nearby residents. All vaccines and supplies will be provided by the Bureau. Currently, the agreed-upon hospitals include: Nanshi Public Shanghai Hospital, Southeast Hospital, Xin Pu Yu Tang Citizens' Clinic, Women and Children's Hospital, Public Education Center Clinic, Nanyang Hospital, Water God Pavilion Clinic, Taizhou Hospital, Labor Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Zhongde Hospital, Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, First Aid Epidemic Hospital, Huxi Public Clinic, Pudong Children's Clinic, Pushantang Clinic, Lianyi Society Western Hospital, Red Cross General Hospital, and the Second and Third Hospitals.</p>
<p>Letter to Schools: Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal infectious disease, which is extremely harmful once it becomes prevalent. Our Bureau has been providing free preventive injections for years. However, due to the large population and poor environment in this city, it cannot be eradicated in a short period of time. Now that the epidemic season is approaching, in order to prevent it, our Bureau has decided to send personnel to your school on May 1st to administer cholera preventive injections to all faculty, staff, students, and school servants, so as to prevent the disease and maintain health. A copy of the publicity material is enclosed for you to post in advance so that everyone knows about it. In addition to sending a letter to the Education Bureau to inform them, we are sending this letter to you accordingly, hoping that you will check it and act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Water Company to Provide Free Water as Usual During Cholera Prevention Period</h3>
<p>During the cholera prevention period in the summers of the past three years, the Shanghai Water Company has been providing free water to Chinese residents who have not yet installed household water pipes. This year, after the Public Works Department inquired with the company, the company's board of directors decided to continue the old practice of providing free water and expressed its willingness to do its best to assist in the prevention of cholera. The Public Works Department has sent a reply expressing its gratitude.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Public Works Department to Investigate and Punish Western Detective No. 122; Russian Trespasses into Pharmacy to Search Goods; Western Detective Counter-Sues Complainant for Insult</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, On the 24th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, which quoted a letter from our member Jihuatang Pharmacy, around 3 PM on the 19th of this month, a person claiming to be a White Russian named Hekinsheng, led Chinese Constable No. 2799 to search the member's store for 'Gegelin' (轧格靈) medicine. The member at that time asked Hekinsheng if he had a search warrant from the court. He replied that he did not understand court search warrants and went to the member's storeroom without permission, forcefully taking a bundle of packaged medicines, falsely claiming that they were counterfeit Gegelin medicine. At that time, Chinese Constable No. 2799 opened and read the bundle, and it was not Gegelin, but a 'gout and bone pain relief tincture' produced by the member. Then Hekinsheng took out a bottle of Gegelin from his own bag, insisting that it was purchased from the member's store and was counterfeit. Chinese Constable No. 2799 asked Hekinsheng if he had a receipt, but he replied that he did not. The member considered Hekinsheng's actions illegal and that there were many bystanders at the door, which was detrimental to the member's reputation. Therefore, the member explained the situation to Chinese Constable No. 2799 and went together to the Lao Zha Patrol Station on Ningbo Road. Unexpectedly, Western Detective No. 122 of that patrol station, named Eynstose, listened to Hekinsheng's claim that he was American and, without asking about the facts, began to scold the member, his voice and expression were fierce, and he seemed about to use force and wanted to detain him. Fortunately, the member explained the facts to other constables and was released after a period of one and a half hours. However, Detective No. 122 never asked Hekinsheng about his nationality or investigated the member's donations and taxes, which were supposed to protect his peace and security. This Western detective, being paid by the public, did not use legal procedures and treated the member in this way, which is extremely detrimental to the reputation of a fair agency and damages the interests of the member. This is not only the damage suffered by the member alone, so we are sending this letter to your council, requesting that you forward it to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting that you give the Western Detective appropriate punishment, etc." Upon receipt, it was found that Hekinsheng had entered the store without a court search warrant and searched the items without permission, which was already illegal. The Western Detective, without asking about the truth of the facts, added insults, which was an abuse of power and should be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we are sending a special letter to your council, requesting that you forward it to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, requesting that you thoroughly investigate the truth and strictly punish him, which is our earnest hope. Upon receipt, it was found that since Hekinsheng did not carry a search warrant, there was no way to prove that his search was due to the performance of his duties. The Jihuatang Pharmacy stopped him and invited Chinese Constable No. 2799, who witnessed the scene, to the Lao Zha Patrol Station to inquire about the truth, which was a necessary measure to protect the safety of the business. Western Detective No. 122, as a public official, should have had rules for handling affairs. A citizen making a complaint to a public official is not a crime. Insulting a citizen's personality is a minor offense, and such an impression left in the minds of the general public would further damage the relationship between China and foreign countries. Since our council has received a report from the association, we are sending a letter to your bureau accordingly, and we hope that you will give a fair and just disposition, which is our earnest request."</p>
<h3>New Shanghai-Taicang Automobile Station Completed; Scheduled to Move into New Station on May 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company began preparations in a flat in the intersection of Gonghe New Road and Yongxing Road in Zhabei in 1920. It opened to traffic in 1921, initially only reaching Dachang, gradually extending to Liuhang and Luodian. On New Year's Day of 1922, the entire route was opened to traffic. At the same time, a ticket office was built at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Gonghe New Road, which is now Ding Huai Detang Pharmacy. Later, as business became increasingly developed, a larger Shanghai station ticket office was built at the intersection of Datong Road and Baoshan County Road (now Shanghai-Taicang Road) in 1928. Various offices were attached to it. Currently, in order to facilitate passengers, the station has rented land at the intersection of Guangfu Road and Wu Bo Road Bridge and built a new three-story Western-style building. It is now completed. The lower floor is the waiting room, ticket office, stationmaster's office, etc. The second floor is the offices of various departments, and the third floor is the dormitory. The back is the garage, where passengers can get on and off the bus. There are several small rooms for tea porters, etc. It is also understood that the company's fares will not increase. In addition, the Wu Zhen Road Bridge to the original station will not stop. Non-company employees are not allowed to get on and off the bus because that section is the business scope of the Chinese public bus and there is a contract.</p>

<h3>Misfortunes in "Manure King's" Family: Another Lawsuit Arises; Concubine of Hong Kui Files Suit; Requesting Recognition of Status</h3>
<p>Following the death of Ma Fuqi, the late "Manure King," and his wife, A'gui Jie's eldest son, Ma Hongkui, in the autumn of last year due to illness, Ma Chen, Hongkui's wife, along with her children, Ma Lusheng, Luying, and Luzhen, hired lawyers and sued Ma Honggen, her husband's younger brother, and Ma Wang, her husband's concubine (also known as Wang A'da), in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, for encroaching on inheritance. The court has repeatedly held hearings and summonsed parties, but postponed the hearing and ordered the parties to hire accountants to verify the property and reach a settlement. Details have been previously reported. Now, Ma Qin (24 years old), a woman from Nanjing and the concubine of the late Ma Fenghui, together with her son, Lushan (11 years old), hired lawyers and filed a petition in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court against Ma Chen and her children, requesting mediation and recognition of her status. The petition states that Ma Hongkui, the late husband of Ma Chen, had a relationship with the petitioner in 1923. The following year, they cohabited in Yongfu Lane on Lanweiai Road and later gave birth to a son, Lushan. At the time, Hongkui's mother, A'gui Jie, learned of the situation and was delighted to have a grandson. She ordered Honggen to move the petitioner to a house built by her in Guifu Lane, Beile Road, to save expenses. Soon after, Hongkui's father, Fuqi Gong, passed away. The petitioner and her son also went to the house to mourn and wear mourning clothes. During the seven-day memorial, Lushan's name was included in the funeral oration. Later, Hongkui took Wang A'da as a concubine, and as a result, his affection for the petitioner gradually faded. The petitioner, unable to support herself, took her son to work for a living. Recently, the petitioner learned of Hongkui's death, and her future life became even more difficult. She also resents that she has not been recognized for more than ten years. Therefore, she requested that the defendants be summoned to court for mediation and recognition of her status. The court approved the petition and summoned both parties, scheduling the hearing for mediation yesterday morning. However, the bailiffs went to the residences of the defendants, Ma Chen and others, at No. 11 Guifu Lane on Boer Road and No. 183 on Wilmont Road, to serve the summons, but because Ma Chen and her children had moved away after becoming involved in the lawsuit with Honggen and others, their addresses were unknown, and the summons could not be served. At 10:20 AM yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu of the Second Special District Court mediated the case in Civil Court No. 7. None of the defendants appeared in court. The petitioner Ma Qin and her son Ma Lushan were also represented by their lawyers. The judge stated that the addresses of the defendants were unknown, and the summons could not be served. Therefore, the court could not proceed with the mediation, and the mediation was deemed unsuccessful. The petitioner could file a formal lawsuit separately. If the defendants' addresses were still unknown and the summons could not be served at that time, it could be served by public notice. After the announcement, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Purchasers of Real Estate in Fuxing Village Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau the Day Before Yesterday; The Bureau Scheduled a Three-Party Mediation</h3>
<p>Dagong News: Purchasers of real estate in Fuxing Village, Xiangshan Road, Zhabei, because of the long-standing dispute over the mortgage of the land, which is likely to harm the interests of the purchasers, decided to organize a petition. Yesterday, they petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. It was learned that Youji Company was jointly operated by Chen Changkun, Hu Qihui, Guo Weichen, Liu Hengfu, etc. After the January 28th Incident, they mortgaged the land at the corner of Xiangshan Road and Shichang Road (now Fuxing Village), about eleven mu, to Wang Weiguan, the owner of Delong Tobacco Company, for 125,000 yuan. Later, Hu and Wu withdrew and merged into Chen Changkun alone, renamed Renji Company. Chen, due to lack of funds, was unable to repay the mortgage when it was due and was sued by Wang. Chen, without waiting for the end of the lawsuit, planned to build more than 100 houses on the original site in June of last year, each house and land priced at 2,000 to 2,500 yuan, and set a payment method in installments, selling them piecemeal. Advertisements were placed in newspapers. The general public, unaware of the dispute, purchased 144 houses. Of these, 80 houses were completed by the end of last year, and about 60 households had already moved in. Now, because the creditor Wang Weiguan hired lawyer Wang Youling to file a lawsuit in court for execution, the purchasers believed that it was related to their own interests and negotiated with Chen and Wang, but with no results. Therefore, they organized a joint association of purchasers. In addition to electing Xu Chuanxian as a representative to petition the Municipal Party Department on the 22nd of this month, they also organized a petition group, with more than 60 participants, to petition the Social Affairs Bureau on the afternoon of the 24th, and put forward four petition objectives. The director of the Public Welfare Section of the Fourth Section of the Bureau received them, and the petition representatives personally explained the suffering of being deceived by land traffickers and coerced by wealthy people. Director Sun expressed deep sympathy for the matter, which concerned the livelihood of the majority of the people, and promised to convene a three-party mediation to protect the rights of each purchaser. The representatives then left.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Slaughterhouse to Increase Equipment at Request of Jewish Residents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jewish Residents Association recently suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Council's slaughterhouse, the electrical slaughter method used, could not meet the Jewish religious rules. They proposed purchasing a Wanenber style slaughtering instrument and are willing to pay half of the purchase price. After consideration by the board of directors, the proposal has been approved. The purchase price of the instrument is approximately 2,000 yuan. The funds, as they were not included in this year's hygiene budget, will be allocated separately by the Finance Department.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Exhibition Hall: 700 to 800 Items Already Collected; First Batch to be Shipped to Guangdong Within the Month</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently raised significant funds to establish a merchandise exhibition hall to showcase high-quality domestic goods and promote them effectively. Chairman Xiong Shaokang of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce personally came to Shanghai to discuss item collection with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. A collection agency for exhibits was established within the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's merchandise exhibition hall, and announcements were made. Special personnel were dispatched to contact various producers. Domestic goods manufacturers, recognizing Guangzhou as a major commercial port with a high concentration of merchants and travelers and extensive sales channels for domestic goods, enthusiastically participated and sent their products for display to promote sales. Currently, products from over a hundred manufacturers have been received, including dyed and woven fabrics, clothing, food and beverages, cosmetics, educational stationery, pharmaceuticals, electrical appliances, hygiene products, rubber products and tires, glassware, and other daily necessities, totaling approximately 700 to 800 items. In recent days, many domestic goods manufacturers have visited the collection agency at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to inquire and prepare to send their products. It is reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, due to the approaching opening date of the Guangzhou exhibition hall, has approved the shipment of products received within this month to Guangdong for exhibition. It is expected that a significant number of additional items will be sent later, with the second batch scheduled to be packed and shipped on May 15th.</p>

<h3>Director Wu Pleads for Disaster Victims in His Hometown</h3>
<p>Huangmei County in Hubei Province suffered the most severe disaster last year, with tens of thousands of people dying. The spring famine has left people starving. People from the county who are living in other provinces have been sending letters and telegrams to various places seeking relief. Wu Xingya, the Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, is a native of Huangmei and has always been enthusiastic about his hometown. Yesterday, he sent a telegram, based on a swift letter and urgent telegram from the Huangmei County Fellow-Villagers Association, to the Hubei Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Association to plead for the disaster victims. The telegram is recorded below: "To the esteemed members of the Hubei Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Association, we recently received a swift telegram from the Huangmei County Fellow-Villagers Association in the province stating that the drought last year has had a severe impact on the spring famine. Although your association allocated 2,000 piculs of rice to Shanghai for disaster relief in January and February of this year, it only reached 10,000 elderly, weak, and impoverished people. The remaining tens of thousands of disaster victims are on the verge of starvation at this time of year when food supplies are scarce. Please urgently telegraph your association to find a way to provide assistance. Our county suffered a severe disaster, which your esteemed association has already understood, so we will not repeat the details. Now, at a time when people are starving due to the spring famine, and when the communists are pressing on the border, the local situation is precarious, and the people's lives are in imminent danger. Looking to the future, we are filled with anxiety. We earnestly request your association to quickly allocate a large sum of money to provide relief so as to prevent tens of thousands of disaster victims without clothing or food from becoming displaced and being exploited by the communists. This would be fortunate. Urgent appeal, with utmost sincerity. Wu Xingya bows respectfully."</p>

<h3>Xu Yuangong Reports to the Police: Crying of a Child Heard in a Car; Xu Zishang is Safe; Police Still Investigating</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, a middle-aged man, well-dressed and resembling a businessman, rushed into the Shanzhong Road Police Station in the French Concession and frantically reported to the police chief. According to him, his name was Xu Yuangong, and he lived on Ladu Road. He ran the Yuanki Customs Brokerage on the upper floors of the Salt Industry Bank on Fuzhou Road and owned a car with license plate number 9284. A short while ago, he was returning home from work and had just arrived at his door when he suddenly saw a car parked by the side of the road with license plate number 11085. At that moment, he faintly heard the sound of a child crying inside the car. When the car saw his car arrive, it immediately sped off at full speed in a frantic manner. He had a son named Changlong and feared that he had been kidnapped by bandits, so he quickly drove his own car at full speed to chase after them, but was ultimately unable to catch up. He had come to report this, he said. Upon hearing the report, the police chief immediately telegraphed all police stations and the Public Security Bureau to pay attention to and intercept the car. At the same time, he ordered detectives to follow Xu back home. There, Xu's son Changlong was safe and sound, and Xu's heart was finally at ease. It is unknown why the fleeing car fled. The police are currently investigating the matter.</p>

<p>Jiufu Company's Sheng Dan, a seasonal essential medicine, has been on the market for many years. Its color, aroma, taste, and efficacy are all excellent, making it the only high-quality domestic product that can replace imported goods. Recently, as the weather has become warmer and diseases have begun to spread, it is essential to have Sheng Dan on hand at home and while traveling to maintain hygiene. Numerous pharmacies and foreign and sundry goods stores in Shanghai and other cities have been visiting the company to request distribution rights. It is reported that, to promote domestic goods, the company is making sacrifices with this year's Sheng Dan.

Those who present the voucher for fillings or implants will receive a 50% discount on the regular fee.

<h3>Good News for Those Suffering from Measles and Chickenpox</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the irregular weather and the prevalence of spring epidemics, children with weak constitutions and insufficient resistance are easily infected with measles, chickenpox, and other diseases. If preventive measures are not taken early, it can be very dangerous. Those who have not been infected should purchase and take Hegu Cai, a pediatric medicine, to increase their child's physical resistance, which can eliminate diseases before they even appear. Those who have already been infected should take Hegu Cai immediately, which can turn danger into safety. This medicine is truly a blessing for children, and parents should pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing to you regarding the news item in today's news column about the closure of the Huaming Silver Bank. The facts are slightly inaccurate, and the names of the shareholders and managers are mostly speculative and untrue. The manager of the Huaming Silver Bank is Mr. Shen Nianzu, who has had significant dealings with various sectors, with substantial inflows and outflows, and has a strong reputation for creditworthiness. Currently, due to the inability to collect loans on time, it has temporarily suspended operations and is working hard to remedy the situation. There may be hope for resumption of business. Before reaching the liquidation stage, our firm and Mr. Wang Sifang, the certified accountant, are only representing the notification of the suspension of operations, pending a resolution. Who the shareholders are is not something that can be discussed at this time, so there is no such thing as keeping secrets. Fearing that the outside world will misunderstand the truth and spread rumors, I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Lai Shi Hong Shihao, 25th.</p>
<h3>Widow Sues Aunt Seeking Division of Property; Aunt First Files Lawsuit to Confirm Guardianship; Court Orders Both Parties to Attempt Mediation; If Unsuccessful, Further Hearing Will Be Held</h3>
<p>Sun Jianquan, a wealthy merchant from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, passed away due to illness in March of this year at No. 61, Taihe Lane, Huade Road. He left behind an elderly wife, Mrs. Wang, who is in her seventies, and five grandchildren. Besides the eldest granddaughter, Maiyu, who has married and lives separately with her husband, Mr. Zhu, at No. 57, Taihe Lane, the second granddaughter, Maidi, was taken away by the widow, Li Yuegui, to raise. The remaining three grandchildren are all young and are being taught at home by a tutor hired by Mrs. Wang, allowing her to enjoy</p>
<p>the joy of being with her grandchildren.</p>
<p>However, recently, because her widowed daughter-in-law, Li Yuegui, left the family six or seven years ago and even published a statement in the newspaper stating that she intended to remarry, the family requested that Baodi be returned. But Li Yuegui firmly refused. Thereupon, Sun Wang retained lawyer E Sen and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court seeking confirmation of her right to guardianship over her granddaughter, Baodi. Li Yuegui, on the other hand, claiming that her father-in-law Sun Jianquan's entire estate was no less than 200,000 yuan, and knowing that it was now under her aunt's control, also retained a lawyer in her capacity as the legal representative of her daughter Baodi to file a lawsuit against Sun Wang,</p>
<p>seeking a division of the estate.</p>
<p>She claimed that the estate was estimated to be worth 200,000 yuan. Besides her aunt, Sun Wang, who should receive half, the remainder should be divided into six shares for the five children of her deceased husband, Sun Tongqing, and herself, so that she and her daughter can maintain their livelihood. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan held a hearing on the case filed by Sun Wang seeking confirmation of guardianship. Because the defendant, Li Yuegui, failed to appear, Judge Qiao only questioned the plaintiff, Sun Wang, briefly and adjourned the hearing. Afterwards, Judge Zhang Qinglan held a hearing on the property division case. Li Yuegui, being the plaintiff, brought her fourteen-year-old</p>
<p>daughter Baodi</p>
<p>to court. She testified that she was 35 years old and currently lived at No. 6, Shangqin Lane, Qingdao Road, supporting herself and her daughter through handicrafts. She had married Sun Tongqing, the son of the defendant Sun Wang, at the age of 21 as a second wife. His first wife was originally her elder sister, who had two daughters. After her sister died, Tongqing married her as a second wife. She gave birth to two daughters and a son. In 1925, her husband died of illness. Since then, she has been subjected to abuse by the defendant, even falsely accusing her of having</p>
<p>an affair</p>
<p>with her father-in-law. When she was 28 years old, her mother fell ill, but she was not allowed to return to her home province. The various instances of abuse were difficult to describe. She attempted suicide once that year but was rescued. She reluctantly survived until the following year, at the age of 29, when she felt she could no longer live there and took her daughter Baodi and left home. Originally, she intended to commit suicide again, but because she worried that no one would raise this daughter, she continued to live. The defendant once told her that her father-in-law's entire estate was worth 200,000 yuan. She now specially requests a legal division of the estate. While speaking,</p>
<p>tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>Then, lawyer E Sen, representing the defendant Sun Wang, presented a newspaper to the court, stating that Li Yuegui had engaged a lawyer in 1930 to publish a statement in the newspaper declaring her departure from the defendant's family and indicating her intention to remarry. Baodi was born to the defendant's son Tongqing. Because Li Yuegui had made this intention clear, the defendant requested that she return Baodi so that she could receive the same education as the other grandchildren. This is why she filed the lawsuit seeking confirmation of guardianship. The case has already been heard, but because Li Yuegui did not appear, the hearing was adjourned to May 4th for a retrial. Li Yuegui,</p>
<p>after her aunt filed the lawsuit,</p>
<p>also filed a lawsuit seeking a division of property. Since she had published a statement in the newspaper a few years ago declaring her intention to remarry, her current claim for a division of property is obviously intentional. Therefore, the court should suspend this case temporarily and wait for a ruling on the guardianship case before proceeding with the review. Otherwise, the hearing of this case would be hindered. Upon hearing this, Li Yuegui quickly stated that the newspaper statement was merely an expression of intention and that she</p>
<p>had not remarried.</p>
<p>The court then summoned the defendant Sun Wang for questioning. Although she was already in her seventies, she was vigorous, sharp-eared, clear-eyed, and spoke with a clear voice, appearing as if she were only in her fifties. According to her statement, Li Yuegui was formerly her daughter-in-law, but she has been away for several years. Even if she has not openly remarried, she likely has a lover. But her granddaughter was born to her son, so she should be asked to return her so that she can receive the same education as her other grandchildren. Judge Zhang then ordered the parties to leave and attempt mediation. If unsuccessful, a further hearing will be held.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order on New Enrollment Methods for Universities: Enrollment Must First Explain the Situation of Faculty and Facilities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) The Ministry of Education has newly established enrollment methods for universities and has issued an order for their implementation. The purpose is, on the one hand, to adapt to national needs, and on the other hand, to seek practical teaching efficiency. Therefore, the new methods stipulate that all departments should be carefully reviewed by each school regarding the situation of faculty and facilities, and the number of students enrolled in each department should be determined to be in line with the actual situation of each department, so as to achieve the effect of focused attention and earnest education.

In the new methods, for the enrollment of these departments, except for those with outstanding achievements who have been specially approved by the Ministry before enrollment, all are limited to thirty, and no excessive enrollment is allowed. In the display of tolerance, there is also the meaning of restriction and considerable compression. Moreover, the enrollment situation of each school has generally become stable. Therefore, after the new methods are established this year, if there are no special circumstances in the coming years, they will be handled according to these methods. The five articles of the methods are as follows: 1. All departments of literature, law, business, education, science, agriculture, medicine, and engineering under each university and independent college shall, in the future, carefully review the faculty situation and facilities of each department when enrolling new students and transfer students, and determine the number of students enrolled in each department in order to actually obtain teaching efficiency and shall not allow excessive enrollment. 2. Universities with Schools of Literature, Law, and Business Education, etc., and independent colleges with departments of Literature, Law, and Business Education, etc., shall, according to the statistics of enrollment of each school in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the average number of new students and transfer students enrolled in each department of each school or department shall be approximately twenty. In the future, the number of new students and transfer students enrolled in each department or specialized subject of each school or department shall be limited to thirty, except for those with particularly excellent achievements who have been specially approved by the Ministry before the examination. Universities with Schools of Science and Literature or independent colleges with departments of Science and Literature shall follow the provisions of the preceding paragraph for the enrollment of new students and transfer students in each department or specialized subject of each school or department that belongs to literature, law, and business education. Universities with Schools of Science, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine or independent colleges with departments of Science, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, etc., shall also follow the provisions of this article for the enrollment methods of departments or specialized subjects of literature, law, and business education, etc., if they are attached to them. 3. The Ministry will not approve the entry qualifications of new students and transfer students of schools that enroll students in accordance with these methods. 4. These methods shall be implemented from the summer vacation of the 24th year of the Republic of China. 5. These methods do not apply to colleges that only accept female students for the time being.</p>

<h3>The Central Team is Getting More and More Courageous, Defeated the Nanxing Team Yesterday, the Result was 59 to 30, Central Team vs. Xiexing Today</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters basketball team played its fifth game since coming to Shanghai against the Nanxing team at the Jiaotong University gymnasium at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. In the contest, the Central team was exceptionally brave, especially "Flying Legs" Liu Daguan and giant Tian Kang were the most outstanding, playing vigorously and colorfully. Nanxing was helpless and lost with a score of 30 to 59. Today at 4:00 p.m., the last battle will be fought at Shenyuan with the Xiexing Sports Equipment Company. The competition situation yesterday is briefly described below:</p>
<p>First half After the start of the game, Nanxing took the lead. After Chen Hu opened the record, Zhou Nu'an and Liu Jingfeng scored two goals each, and six points were hung high on the scoreboard. The Central team was unwilling to show weakness, and Tang Shaohua bravely stood up and shot from a distance. Nanxing's Zhou and Chen doubled back, leading 10 to 2. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Central team requested a timeout to secretly plan the strategy. When the battle started again, the Central team really succeeded. Tang Shaohua scored first, Liu Daguan made contributions later, and Tian Kang competed with them, and took the lead with 14 to 10. From then on, the Central team suddenly became powerful. Liu and Tian shot at will, and none of them missed. The score rose like a clear cloud. At the end of the first half, the Central team took the lead with a huge score of 42 to 15.</p>
<p>Second half At the beginning of the second half, Fu Xingzhi tried to reverse the situation, and the Central team also refused to give in, so the situation became more tense. Relying on the strength of Liu Daguan, Tian Kang, etc., the Central team's score increased layer by layer. Although Nanxing tried hard to counterattack, it often lost more than it gained. The largest difference in score was 47 to 15. Later, Liu Jingfeng worked hard and chased it to 53 to 20. At this time, Nanxing's new force Liu Jiang immediately responded and transferred Zhang Daqi, and the military situation was greatly shaken. Liu Jingfeng made two free throws, Chen Hu turned around under the basket, and Zhou Chen met each other from left and right, creating a situation of 53 to 28. The Central team Rongzhao made two penalties and one throw, and Daguan's contribution was not inferior. Nanxing's Chen Hu shot a goal, and the score surged to 59 to 30. The Central team won a great victory.</p>

<h3>Guangxia Wins Basketball Game Against Guoguang</h3>
<p>The Guangxia basketball team played against Guoguang Middle School at the Guangxia First Ball Field yesterday. Guangxia Captain Liu Kehan was absent due to circumstances, resulting in slight adjustments to the lineup, but they still managed to win 25-19, leading from beginning to end.</p>
<h3>White Rainbow to Hold Sports Meet on the 28th at Hongkou Park. Match Against China Postponed</h3>
<p>The Guoguang Society said that the White Rainbow Track and Field Team will hold its own sports meet this Sunday (28th) at Hongkou Park. Because Hongkou Park is preventing public danger and prohibiting the holding of sports meets. Other short, middle, and long-distance runs, as well as field events, will be held one by one. Because domestic and foreign team members are participating in the International Seven-Team competition, athletes such as Liu Changchun, Cheng Jinkuan, Li Shiming, Chen Baoqiu, Leng Peigen, Gu Huo, and Wang Jianwu have gathered in Shanghai, so the results are expected to exceed expectations and may break multiple records. However, White Rainbow will go all out to compete in the international competition the day before, and the performance of each team member may be slightly affected by this intense activity. The previously reported match against China on the 28th has been decided to be postponed.</p>
<h3>My Philosophy as a Basketball Referee (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Mr. Dahl of the United States, Translated by Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>The extent to which fouls influence the outcome of a game has been studied and is still being studied. In the "Sports Monthly," the author has written a considerable assessment on this point. This type of research does not include errors by players and coaches, so the responsibility for declaring fouls is placed entirely on the shoulders of the referee, while other factors in the game (such as missed shots by each team) are not included, which is unfair.</p>
<p>If these factors are presented, the situation will be completely different. In a close game, one team lost by three points. Upon checking the game record, it was found that the team missed 49 shots. After the game, while showering, the referee was stopped by the losing team's captain, who blamed him for not calling enough fouls on the opposing defense, which prevented his forwards from attacking and led to the loss. This was the losing team captain's main point of contention. He never considered that his own team missed 49 shots, and these shots were close to the basket. If his own team's shooting was slightly more accurate, even with only a few of these opportunities, the game's record would have been completely different.</p>
<p>Summary of the above opinions: The above opinions are written for novice referees. The following are some more specific opinions that need to be discussed. Before elaborating, the author wants to summarize the opinions that have already been presented:</p>
<p>(1) There is no secret to a referee's success. Hard work accounts for most of the victory and will lead to ultimate success. Furthermore, a referee must have a love and deep passion for refereeing that far exceeds any material reward. There is no one who can achieve true success with the sole purpose of monetary gain. Therefore, one must always maintain a spirit of deep love for this game. Otherwise, the referee is simply a walking corpse. As for poor officiating, monetary rewards cannot comfort the referee's inner pain after the game. Even if it can make them feel comforted by unfair criticism, it is not enough to alleviate the feeling of unease in their throat. If their officiating is poor during the game and their decisions are inappropriate, it will hinder the outcome of the game. Therefore, the first suggestion is: if you want to be a successful referee, you must work hard and continuously.</p>
<p>(2) During the game, one must declare fouls according to the rules. Therefore, one must be very familiar with every rule. There is no need to carry the rules onto the field. In fact, if you can remove a novice referee's hesitation and have confidence, then there is no need to carry the rules around.</p>
<p>(3) Once you are familiar with the rules, you only need to declare fouls according to the rules, without bias or fear.</p>
<p>(4) One must have sharp eyesight and be able to see everything. When a single person is refereeing, they must also take into account the ball and other parts outside of where the players are gathered, especially when jumping the ball, they must look behind them. It is said that one must have eyes in the back of their head.</p>
<p>(5) Sharp eyesight alone is not enough. One must also have quick and immediate judgment and make decisions. After a foul is discovered, it should be announced immediately. Pay extra attention to this aspect, and the difficulty of being a referee will be reduced.</p>
<p>(6) Regardless of who you come into contact with—players, coaches, other staff, and spectators—you must be practical and not meddlesome, courteous but not flattering. One must know the value of self-control, which is no less important than familiarity with the rules, an abundance of common sense, quick judgment, and a brave heart. No matter what situation may arise, no matter who may lose their composure, a referee must not do so. Many spectators may become carried away due to the intensity of the game, but this is their right. In fact, their frenzy during the game comes at a price. It is common for players and coaches to lose their self-control during intense and exciting games. This is only human nature. However, a referee must maintain self-control from beginning to end during intense and exciting games, and remain calm. No matter how serious the mistakes of players or coaches may be, it must still be so. When the words and actions of players or coaches cross the line and are inappropriate, they can naturally be punished by giving the other team a free throw. However, when declaring a technical foul, it must be done with caution and executed with care.</p>
<p>Attitude towards the audience: Do not use technical characteristics to give a team a free throw and make an enemy of the audience. The habit of declaring fouls to the audience often seems unfair to the penalized team, because the audience's behavior is often not related to the seemingly deserved punishment. According to the author's many experiences, it is better to stop the game and explain the reason for declaring the foul. Generally, the good-spirited members of the audience can often stop the bad ones. Sometimes this method cannot be implemented, then it is best to ignore the audience completely. There was one time when the author let a team have as many as eight free throws before the opposing audience calmed down, and although this pass was secure, he was terrified when he thought about what to do if the audience still did not stop. Therefore, other methods are still preferable. Although the last resort is still to declare a foul on the audience. The above six points are the outline of a successful referee. If readers wish to become a referee, they must add common sense and courage, then they have already achieved the beginning of success.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Cold Kiss)</p>
<p>Someone commented on the changing trends of Chinese marriage systems, saying: "The changing trends of Chinese marriage can be roughly divided into (1) mortgage marriage, (2) uxorilocal marriage, (3) remarriage, (4) child betrothal, (5) waiting-for-husband marriage, (6) abduction marriage, (7) adoption marriage, (8) ghost marriage, eight types." They can be described as varied and diverse. It is a pity that no one has tried all eight types, otherwise, if they had tried them all, they would have tasted the sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy flavors of life.</p>
<p>It is said that Zhang Zongchang once taught his son like this: "Look at me, I am all courage. You only know how to study. I don't know a single word, but I also made this great career. There are many unemployed people in China, all because they were educated." Although his words are absurd, upon reflection, they are quite humorous.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui recently told someone: "Rescuing the country from its difficulties only requires opening up three major roads, and success can be achieved. The first is to revive the countryside, the second is to complete the bandit suppression plan, and the third is to prepare the latest weapons." If we can do this, then the lost land can be recovered and the national crisis can be resolved naturally.</p>
<p>Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province, governs Shandong extremely strictly. If a smoker is caught, the recidivist is executed by shooting, and the first offender has the character "义" [yi] (righteousness) tattooed on their forehead. It is said that the character "义" is reversed and split apart to mean "I am a tortoise."</p>
<h3>Face</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Actors who perform in operas must wear face paint. Red face paint signifies loyalty, black face paint signifies courage, white face paint signifies treachery, and colorful face paint signifies a clown who makes people laugh—wearing a certain type of face paint represents the identity of a certain type of person.</p>
<p>I think, if all the living beings in this world could express the thoughts in their hearts as clearly as opera actors, then how peaceful would this world be, and how serene would this society be? Naturally, I think, at the very least, there would be no need for mutual deception, because the depths of anyone's mind would be easily understood by others. This perfectly aligns with the saying, "People's hearts are as different as their faces."</p>
<p>However, this is just wishful thinking, just a scene that actors perform on stage. In reality, in this society, there are plenty of people with the faces of robbers but the hearts of bodhisattvas, and there are also plenty of people with the faces of bodhisattvas but the hearts of robbers—although there are also people with the faces and hearts of robbers, or the faces and hearts of bodhisattvas.</p>
<p>Why did God create people with so many different faces? This is truly an eternal enigma that cannot be solved. But I think, if these many different faces could express the status and character of each person like actors do, wouldn't it save a lot of scheming and intrigue in this world? Unfortunately, God did not create people that way.</p>
<p>This truly makes me feel somewhat lost!</p>
<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Blood is the most precious thing on a person's body. If there is too little blood in a person's body, they will get sick or even die. In ordinary bodies, blood only maintains physiological functions, but the blood in the chests of martyrs is extraordinary—it can awaken the national spirit, wash away national humiliation, restore lost territories, and inspire the cowardly to become brave. But this kind of blood is too precious, and its meaning is too significant, so it can only be found in the bodies of immortal martyrs. In the bodies of ordinary, mediocre people, it is impossible to find even a drop or two, even though it is the same bright red color.</p>
<p>In lower-class society, blood is a synonym for money, as if to say that blood and money are both indispensable to life. But we can often see millionaires suffering from anemia. Although they have so much money, medicine has not yet advanced to the point where colorful banknotes can be injected into the body.</p>
<p>But recently I heard people say that some poor college students in our eastern neighbor, because they don't have money for school, sell their blood to hospitals to be transfused to wealthy people with anemia. In this case, the rich man's money is simply blood, and the poor man's blood is also money, so blood and money are one and the same. Logically speaking, this may not be inconsistent.</p>
<p>If the theory that blood and money are one and the same can be established, then we should love blood and love money. Using foreign goods and letting money flow out is like letting our blood flow out. Keeping this blood can make the country strong. Therefore, here, I wish everyone to cherish all blood and not let it flow away easily.</p>
<p>It is appropriate to use a long-term perspective to see everything.</p>
<h3>Correction of Strange Surnames</h3>
<p>— Wei Yu</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this publication, there was an article about strange surnames, which mentioned the surname "尢" [wang], claiming that it was pronounced "汪" [wang]. This is a grave error. "尢" is an ancient form of the character "尤" [you]. Any slightly complete dictionary will have a record of this. Those with the surname "尢" actually have the surname "尤" and are absolutely not pronounced "汪". Throughout our country, there are many surnames "尤" without a dot. All surnames "尤" without a dot in Wuxi and Suzhou are descendants of Youfu Jian Gong. Those surnames "尢" in Suzhou, such as those in Liujia Port and Phoenix Street, are all surname "尤" but without a dot. The "尢" in Liujia Port was You Xianjia Dingfu, a leading figure in Suzhou in the past, and he has many descendants. We have never heard of anyone calling him Wang Dingfu. 尢毅, who writes for the Shanghai Xiaoribao, is the alias of You Ban Kuang, and is also not Wang Ban Kuang. Therefore, it is a grave error to claim that the surname "尢" is pronounced "汪".</p>
<p>As for why there is a surname "尤" with and without a dot, and what its origins are, Wei Yu is not clever enough and cannot examine it in detail. Some say that it is because the dot in the character "尤" resembles the character "犬" [quan] (dog), so the dot was removed. This statement seems too absurd, but it can be examined that "尢" is an ancient form of "尤". It is true that the character "尢" is pronounced "汪" when used alone, but the surname "尢" should still be pronounced "尤" and cannot be pronounced "汪", just as the single character 入 [ru] (enter) is pronounced 善 [shan] when used as a surname and not 堆 [dui] (heap). (Additionally, in Liu Xunwei's "Talking About Surnames" on the 12th, Linghu Zhao is a pen name, not the surname Ling, so this is specifically corrected. - Editor's Note)</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>Old Painter's Family Feast</h3>
<p>— Translated by Tao</p>
<p>We often attend the banquets at the old painter Ding Song's house. The night before last, we were invited by lawyer Li Zhishan to spend the whole evening at his place again. Although it was drizzling, everyone's interest was particularly strong. Lawyer Li, despite being a famous legal scholar, has a special connection with the literary and art circles. Most of the people he invited that day were famous figures. When I arrived at the banquet, several distinguished guests had already arrived. The most striking to me was the tall and slender film emperor Jin Yan. What a heroic and cheerful person he was! His alcohol capacity was the most impressive. He liked to drink beer, one cup after another. It was a pity that the petite Ms. Wang Renmei arrived late due to filming. Around ten o'clock, there was a knock on the door. Young Mr. Ding opened the door, and it turned out to be Wildcat jumping in. Jin Yan hurriedly hid his whole body under the round table. Everyone cheered and said: "Old Jin has gone to get drunk." Renmei said: "It doesn't matter if he's gone," but she still didn't believe it and searched around until she found him.</p>
<p>Those who drank sat at one table, and those who didn't drink sat at another. The host was also a generous drinker, so he brought twenty-four drinking games with him. Everyone drew one. The most hilarious one was drawn by Ban Kuang, who had to imitate a dog barking three times. Mr. Shu De, the father of Miss Yuan Meiyun, drew one where he had to imitate a cat meowing three times. Because they refused to meow, they were each fined three cups of wine. Xiong Fei drew one where he had to call Ding's mother "Mom" three times. He called out three times very readily and affectionately. Everyone said: "Young Mr. Ding has another older brother now."</p>
<p>Including Mrs. Ding, there were only four female guests. Miss Yuan Meiyun was of course the focus of everyone's attention. She wore no makeup, and her demeanor was polite and quiet. What artistic talent and great future she has! In addition, singers Yan Fei and Ouyang Feili also enlivened the atmosphere a lot.</p>
<p>Brother Yi Fang and Miss Yan Fei drew lots to sing. Miss Yan was originally a singing saint, and without hesitation, she sang "Su San Don't Cry." Yi Fang, not to be outdone, sang an excerpt from "Cao Cao Captured and Released." Everyone said: "It tastes even better than the [Kirin] School." Some people wanted them to do another one, but they didn't agree. Someone drew a lot where the female guest with permed hair had to drink. It was really strange, none of the four female guests had permed hair. They said: "We are promoting the New Life Movement." Later, it was discovered that Miss Yan's hair had slight curls. Everyone wanted her to sing, but she refused, saying that it was natural and how could she be asked to drink. Someone else drew a lot where the male guest with no hair had to sing. Chen Tingchao's hair was the shortest, and everyone insisted on making him drink. He said: "I have a flat top haircut, how can I drink," but he couldn't resist the public opinion.</p>
<p>When the banquet ended, Jin Yan, Ding Song, Yi Fen, Ban Kuang, and the host Zhishan were still gambling and drinking beer. Mrs. Ding was originally also a heavy drinker, but she drank very little that day because her eyes were a little red. Little-bearded Wu Tianweng hadn't been seen for a long time. He was still wearing a melon-shaped hat with red knots and carrying a walking stick. Ban Kuang said: "Tianweng can be considered to have increased both virtue and age." Mr. Wu said: "Let's leave it to old Mr. Yuan."</p>
<p>These interesting banquets in the literary and art circles have been rare recently, but old painter Ding's house still occasionally has them to add some flavor.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, Hiding Behind Curtains; Working Hard to Save Lamp Oil, Copying Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Zhiqian agreed very much with Zhou Yourong's suggestion, so he beckoned to Wang Beihai. Under the current circumstances, Beihai really had no heart to do extra homework. However, the teacher beckoned for him to go, and he brought his book over. When he arrived at Zhou Yourong's room, the first thing he saw was a high pile of newspapers, large and small. From this, one could tell that he was very concerned about current affairs. He picked up the newspapers on the table with both hands, put them in the corner of the wall, and said with a smile, "Now the table is spacious, you can work." Beihai said: "There is no hurry, we can also go to Mr. Cheng's room to study later." Zhou Yourong said: "I suppose you can't concentrate on reading and listening to lectures here with me. Actually, times are different now. It is impossible to find secluded valleys in deep mountains to study like the ancients. First, the books we read now are based on science. Not only do we need the teacher to explain, but we also need instruments to do experiments. Second, studying to become an official is not what we do now. Now we need to learn skills to make a living in society. When people enter society, they need to be in contact with people everywhere, and modern society is very complicated. In a company's office, there are often dozens of people working in one place. If you practice not being disturbed when writing lists and drafts, it would be useful for the time when you can't get started at all. So, I don't agree with the ancient method of studying behind curtains." Zhiqian said: "What you said is very correct, but Beihai is not afraid that you will disturb him, but he is afraid that he will disturb you." Zhou Yourong said: "I most admire hardworking young people, and I am not afraid of people disturbing me while reading." (191)</p>
<h3>Records of Drifting Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>What happened after that? It was just taking apart the ornaments on this hat and nailing them onto those phoenix shoes, using them interchangeably; otherwise, it would definitely not be enough. Fortunately, pearls are very durable. Unless you scratch them with something, they will not break easily. So, when a pair of phoenix shoes became too old (definitely not because they were worn too much, let alone being worn out) and no longer needed to be kept, the shoe body would be discarded, but all the pearls would be taken off and handed over to the shoemakers to tidy up for use in decorating new shoes.</p>
<p>There were also two ways to nail pearls onto the shoe surface: the first was the one I mentioned above, first stringing the pearls together with silk threads, and then nailing the silk threads onto the shoe surface; the second was to directly nail the pearls onto the shoe surface one by one, using pearls instead of colored threads to form various patterns. This kind of nailing is not only more solid, but also more refined and elegant than embroidering flowers and then nailing pearls. I remember when I first entered the palace, I praised these phoenix shoes decorated entirely with pearls without restraint. Furthermore, because I was not yet familiar with the Empress Dowager's temper, I openly revealed my admiration. The Empress Dowager's temperament was such that she liked to give people what they admired most, so she immediately ordered people to pick out two pairs of phoenix shoes decorated with pearls in the same way and give them to me. I was naturally very happy to accept them. But from then on, when I saw her new shoes, I dared not praise or admire them like that again, otherwise, she might have given me all the phoenix shoes in the shoe store without any hesitation! But although I didn't get that many, the total number of pairs of phoenix shoes that the Empress Dowager gave me before and after was indeed several dozens. I still treasure three or four pairs to this day! (301)</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Price Changes in an Instant: First Rises to $811 Due to Expensive Spot Goods, Then Plummets $12.50 Due to the Report of Rising Silver Prices in India</h3>
<p>The gold market changed unpredictably yesterday. Initially, it reacted to the stimulus of expensive spot goods and rebounded. Later, the price of silver in India rose sharply, the exchange rate was unusually firm, and it was also pressured by the exchange rate, resulting in a new low price of $781.80. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that silver prices in the British and American markets continued to rise, large traders were also bullish, the forward silver price in Montreux also rose by more than one point, and the exchange rate shrank. The rise in the price of gold in London by two and a half pence further dampened market sentiment. Off-site pre-market trading fell to $88-89. Unexpectedly, after the low point, buyers gathered, and rumors of positive news pushed the price up to $98-99. The Central Bank's official listing revealed that the British and American prices both rose, but the customs gold unit price fell by 9%. After a slight fall from the high point, the opening in the morning was still high. After the opening, the banking appetite for purchases was extremely strong, the exchange rate was tight, and large banks came to purchase, breaking through the $800 mark and rising quite rapidly. However, because Reuters and the US telegrams both said that the US Treasury Department announced an increase in the silver price to 77.75 cents, the Central Bank took advantage of the high price to offer shillings, and the upward trend was blocked. Sassoon also had an appetite to offer US dollars and retreated into the $800 mark. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official listing revealed that the British exchange rate was flat and the American exchange rate only shrank by 0.0625, and market sentiment did not seem to be satisfied. In addition, the Central Bank continued to dump shillings, and the domestic market loosened, and once turned weak. However, because banks took advantage of the cheap price to make deals, and Chinese merchants were fundamentally bullish, the buying interest was reactivated again and rose to above $800. After entering this range, although there was some fluctuation, the banking appetite demanded more than the supply, and the chips in the market were exhausted. A certain bank posted a notice saying that it would collect current gold at $9, which caused market sentiment to react sharply, and buying interest increased rapidly. Sellers stood by and watched, and the price once broke through the $10 mark, rising to $811. At noon, because the exchange rate was normal, those who took advantage of the high price to sell were more active, and the market declined. Later, the price of silver in India rose by 19 annas. The market was weak as soon as it opened. After the opening, the exchange rate fluctuated, and the price of silver rose again by 20 annas for the second time. The Central Bank still had a selling appetite and broke the $800 mark. At this time, market sentiment was still stable and mostly fluctuating. However, the exchange rate loosened a lot, and the upward trend was ultimately difficult to initiate. In addition, the Central Bank of China and Qiao Zhifu all dumped shillings, market sentiment gradually weakened, and the price fell. The price of silver in India fell slightly by 2 annas for the third time. After the low point, the price rose slightly. Ultimately, due to the unusually firm exchange rate, the sellers were emboldened and the buyers collapsed. When the $90 mark was broken, a selling atmosphere enveloped the entire market, and the price continued to fall, creating a new low price of $781.80. After the close of the market, the price once broke the $80 mark. The swap spread was posted by the short side at $8. Today, the market situation for the day is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $796.50, an increase of $1 from the previous close. It then became $6.20. Yingxiang, Dadecheng, Huixiang, Shunli, Qingfayong, Hengyu gradually entered to $804. Hengxing and Changda sold to $2. The June shilling was difficult to settle at 5625. Hengyu, Shunli, Dingkang, and Dadecheng advanced, rising to $5.50. The Central Bank offered June shillings at half a penny. Hengyu, Dafayong, Hengxing, Yiyong, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang and others took advantage of the high price to sell, falling to $0.05. Dafayong and Dadecheng still entered to $2. Sassoon offered July US dollars at 25. Xianghe, Hengyu, Hengxing, Huixiang, Yuanmaoyong and others sold out, falling to $798.50. Fuyu and Yingxiang and Yuqingyong delivered, rising back to $801. Jardine Matheson offered May US dollars at 375 and the price still declined. Before long, the Central Bank agreed to offer June shillings at 5625. Huixiang, Hengyu, Hengxing, Dingkang, and Yicheng and Tongtaichang sold to $797. Hengyu and Yongli, although entering to $9.50, knew that the exchange rate listing was flat in British terms, and the US exchange rate only shrank by 0.0625. Hengyu, Hengxing, Wanxing, and Yicheng sold out, and the price fell to $5.80. Dingkang, Huixiang, Dadecheng, and Yicheng took advantage of the low price to advance to $8.80. The Central Bank still had offerings. Shunli, Yingxiang, Yuqingyong, Changda, and Dadecheng sold to $7. Hengyu, Yuqingyong, Wanxing, Dingkang, Yongli, Fuxingyong and others purchased in droves, rising to above $800. The silver balance tax was announced unchanged. Dacheng, Hengyu, and Dafayong still sold to $798.50. Yingxiang, Changda, Hengyu, Wanfeng, Yongli, Huixiang, Yuanchangyong, and Hengchangyong jointly purchased, and Xingye bought July US dollars at 3125, rising back to $805. Hengyu, Yicheng, and Yuanmaoyong took advantage of the high price to sell out, falling to $2.50. Huixiang, Fuyu, and Fushengyong entered to $4.70. Yuanmaoyong and Hengyu and Hengchangyong sold out, falling again to $1.60. Huixiang, Shunmao, Jiarun, and Wanfeng scrambled to purchase, but there was a lack of supply, rising to $6.80. Hengyu, Shunli Dadecheng, Changda, Dada, Shendayong, and Yuankangxiang came to supply in droves, falling to $5.30. Market sentiment was still strong and purchases were drying up. Hengyu, Shunmao, Dadecheng, Changda, Wanfeng and others continued to buy in, with Hengyu and Dadecheng making the most effort, breaking through the $10 mark and rising to $811. Qianchangxiang, Hengxing, Fuyu, Lifeng, Fushengyong, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Tongtaichang, Yifengyong, Jinlong and others took advantage of the opportunity to gradually close their positions. The exchange rate was normal, falling to $805.60. The noon closing price was high at $806.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $804.30, and the exchange rate immediately loosened. July US dollars at 4375 were difficult to sell. Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuli, and Wanxing sold out, falling to $1. Yicheng and Dadecheng delivered, rising to $2.30. The price of silver in India rose again by 20 annas for the second time. The Central Bank agreed to sell June shillings at 625. Hengyu, Yongli, and Fuyu sold out and broke the $800 mark, falling to $799. Changda and Yiyu still entered, rising to above $800. China Chaozha has already sold June shillings at 6875.

The trend appeared to rise and fall slightly with the gold price, but the overall trend was still stable. The initial price of Tianjin goods was increased by $17. The guest banks were doing business with each other, and the silver shops made slight profits. A small number of transactions were made.

Later, Yingfenghong bought back 350 taels at $15.75, because the gold price fell and the swap spread rose to $8. The swap spread was stimulated by the spot price.

<h3>The Central Bank's Selling Appetite Suppressed High Prices: The Exchange Rate Tightened and Then Hardened: The Price of Silver in India Rose Significantly</h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the big London bar also lengthened by 4375. The ground price turned strong after the close of the market, because speculators needed it and there was a lack of sellers. The price of silver in New York rose by 1.75 cents, and the price of forward silver in Montreux also rose by 1.2 to 1.5 cents. The price of gold in London rose by 2.5 pence, the exchange rate of British against US shrank by 1.25, the exchange rate of US against British fell by 1 cent, the exchange rate of US against French fell by 19 pfund 음, the exchange rate of US against French rose by half a cent. The selling price of the recent British exchange rate opened in the morning at 1 shilling 7 pence 75, and the US exchange rate opened at $39.875, compared with the previous close, the British exchange rate loosened by 0.09375, and the US exchange rate hardened by 125. The Central Bank's official listing revealed that the British exchange rate rose by 125, and the US exchange rate rose by 1875. The customs gold unit price fell by 9%, all without any influence. The psychology of Chinese merchants was stimulated and turned better. The market immediately tightened, and the bank's buying appetite was quite strong, which helped the buying atmosphere a lot. However, the Central Bank took advantage of the high price to vigorously sell. The Western merchant Sassoon also had a selling appetite. The US Treasury Department's foreign telegram announced that it would raise the silver price to 77.75 cents, 7. Before long, the shape was stable, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official listing revealed that the British exchange rate was flat and the US exchange rate only shrank by 0.0625. The Central Bank continued to sell, and the market loosened slightly once, but the psychology of Chinese merchants had shown a reaction. Before long, they came to grab the knot again, and the bank's appetite demanded more than the supply. Rumors were abundant, and the process gradually tightened again and again. Later, the exchange rate flattened out again because the bank took advantage of the high price to spit out its holdings. In the afternoon market, the price of silver in India initially rose by 19 annas, and then rose by 20 annas again. The Central Bank of China both came to sell out and loosen the market. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also came to supply. After this, although Sassoon had short covering, it was ultimately difficult to maintain under the high pressure of the Central Bank's selling atmosphere. The price of silver in India was slightly lower by 2 annas for the third time, and market sentiment had weakened, causing the process to harden again and again. The selling price of the recent British exchange rate dared to be 1 shilling 7 pence 9375 and 8 pence pairing, and the US exchange rate was $40.25, compared with the previous close, the British exchange rate loosened by 3125, and the US exchange rate hardened by half a yuan. The gold banks threw about 100,000 pounds of shillings and $1 million of US dollars. China, the Central Bank, and Qiao Zhifu had a particularly strong selling atmosphere, while Sassoon was grabbing. British-American Tobacco Company settled the payment. Today, the transaction price for the day is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bond Market Shows More Declines Than Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange continued to trade May contracts for one month, but activity was not robust. Today is the settlement date for April futures, and the market will be closed. June futures will begin trading on the 27th, which should bring a new atmosphere. However, although there are no significant visible restrictions in the environment, undercurrents are brewing, with widespread anxiety due to tight money conditions. Market price changes will still depend on the financial situation. The 96 market price is gradually stabilizing because the No. 4 shorts are actively covering, making it temporarily difficult to relax. Yesterday's performance was unremarkable, mostly consolidating firmly. Neither buyers nor sellers showed enthusiasm. The day's results showed mostly declines, with only about one-fifth of the issues gaining. Six issues fell by two "jiao", while 96 showed no change. The total trading volume was 4,915,000 yuan, with 96 accounting for 1,740,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Silver Stocks Show Outstanding Performance</h3>
<p>A report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm states that yesterday (24th) the New York stock market was actively traded. Although the bulls took profits, the market situation was still quite firm. The highlight of the day was the outstanding performance of silver stocks. Currently, the world silver price has exceeded the U.S. Treasury's price, so the Treasury can raise its price at any time. The Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis grain exchanges, due to the reorganization of the Shan Lu Sheng Peng Grain Company, feared that massive sales would disrupt the world grain market and remained closed all day. Under these circumstances, it is commendable that the stock market remained stable. All three grain exchanges mentioned above are scheduled to open as usual tomorrow. The bond market was mixed but generally firm. Small exchange stocks advanced under the leadership of mining stocks. The total daily trading volume was 1.28 million shares. The Dow Jones indexes are listed below:</p>
<p>April 23 April 24 Change</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Sales Declining, Standards Gradually Returning to Normal, Reverting to Near-Low, Far-High Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market has seen a slight increase again, with a peaceful situation. However, most opinions in the market are pessimistic about the yarn market because the sales period is declining, and there are concerns about increased inventory in the future. Therefore, large firms have temporarily abandoned it, and the market has returned to a near-low, far-high pattern, reverting to the front line of three months ago.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Profit Covering</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market was still flat and sluggish in each month, but the trading floor was drier because new sellers were not active. At the same time, spot gold rose, and those taking profits were active in covering shorts. As a result, each month rose by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 "jiao" compared to the previous day's close. After the afternoon opening, it was heard that although spot yarn sales were declining, Changfeng was buying, and the market atmosphere was still tight. As a result, each month rose by another 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 "jiao" compared to the morning closing price. Sellers included Suilong 1,350 bales, Hexing 450 bales, Junchang 700 bales, Hengchang 600 bales, Xinhua 550 bales, Taichang 400 bales, and Xianyuan 450 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Lifted by Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending flat, and the market sentiment is becoming increasingly firm. Although silver prices continue to rise sharply, the gold market is trending upwards, disappointing the shorts. A certain company is heavily covering shorts, and the market is slowly rising. However, the overseas cotton market remains sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao, Dafeng, and Gengfeng Cover Shorts</p>
<p>The opening of the spot cotton market was sluggish and stagnant in each month. Later, it was heard that spot gold broke through the 800 yuan mark, and Dafeng and Gengfeng heavily covered shorts. The market situation became urgent, and prices slowly rose. As a result, each month rose by 0.1 to 0.15 "jiao" compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening was still flat. It was heard that the gold price entered the 800 yuan mark again, and Indian cotton in the unofficial market fell by one rupee, but when bidding reached 231, the market atmosphere turned tight again because Dafeng and Gengfeng came to cover shorts again. However, the overall situation was quite flat. Sellers included Yuda 3,700 dan, Hexing 1,700 dan, Junchang 3,800 dan, Changhe 1,500 dan, Yuanfeng 1,000 dan, and Runkang 1,800 dan.

<p>Shashi Cotton 42.75 Dakang Factory entered 100 pieces Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened lower due to profit-taking by the bulls, with each month falling by 1 to 4 points. Subsequently, due to uncertainty in the market, prices showed a mixed picture. In the afternoon, traders bought in, once soaring upwards. Unfortunately, the May contract bulls were still gradually taking profits, causing the price to rise and then fall back. The closing was stable. Spot prices were unchanged, while futures rose or fell by 1 to 3 points. It is heard that the reduction in Brazilian and Indian cotton production will offset the increase in other foreign cotton production. According to Washington news, Senator Thomas expects the U.S. silver price to rise again. The government's crop report for this week is largely similar to the situation at this time in previous years. English spot cotton rose by one point, while futures fell by one point. Indian cotton initially fell due to profit-taking by the bulls, hedging by European exporters, and a few sales of new cotton, but later recovered due to firm silver prices. Pingle rose by 0.25 rupees, Oumula rose by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 0.25 to 2 rupees. Original telegrams are listed below (dated 24th):</p>

<h3>Grains: Sultry Weather Surprisingly Stimulates Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw prices first decline and then rise for all months. When prices opened, due to sunny weather and a slight decrease in foreign wheat, prices for all months once again loosened. The lowest price for the current month was 4.175 "jiao", and the forward months also decreased by 0.075 to 0.1 "fen". However, after the second round of trading, due to factories halting sales and outside buyers actively purchasing, customers also made small purchases, and the market atmosphere stabilized again. When the afternoon session opened, due to the hot and humid weather and dense clouds, with the possibility of rain, although transactions for all months were sparse, the market sentiment gradually improved. Later, the bulls sold out, and prices softened slightly again. This rise and fall will depend on the weather. As a result, the current month rose slightly by 0.075 "jiao", May was unchanged, June rose slightly by 0.5 "fen", July rose by 0.1 "fen", August rose by 0.075 "jiao", and September rose by 0.1 "fen".</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Gains Support from Flour; There's Talk of U.S. Wheat Declining</h3>
<p>The futures wheat market saw prices initially fall and then rise for all months. Foreign wheat prices were quoted as "no market" in Chicago and down 0.20 "jiao" in Canada. When prices opened, due to the slight decrease in foreign wheat and sunny weather, people's sentiment became unstable for the forward months. July and August fell by 0.2 to 0.3 "fen" compared to the previous day, while September was unchanged. However, there were few transactions, and prices later stabilized. When the afternoon session opened, transactions for the current month were quiet, with little price movement. The forward months, due to fewer sellers and a rebound in the flour market, saw sentiment improve, rising by 0.3 to 0.5 "fen" compared to the lowest morning prices. With such small price changes, there is little meaning. Soon, new wheat will enter the market, and significant price fluctuations will depend on the supply, demand, and crop conditions. As a result, July and August rose by 0.2 "fen", and September rose by 0.3 "fen". The spot wheat market has stabilized, with high-quality wheat stable and medium-quality wheat average. Shandong wheat opened at 3.96 yuan, Yingzhou wheat at 3.95 yuan, Bengbu at 3.95 yuan, Luohe wheat at 3.878 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 3.90 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 3.87 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.71 yuan. A total of 6,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat: Tomorrow (25th), a major Chicago company will sell off and simultaneously cover futures. Therefore, the market is expected to be unstable at the opening tomorrow. Before the delivery date, both bulls and bears will also settle heavily in the May contract. On Monday, the exchange had a total of 33 million bushels in the May account. Rain is expected, covering a wide area. The underlying potential of the market is still stable, but there is a lack of new purchases. Overall, the current grain market seems to be waiting for news to develop.</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat April 23 April 24 Change</p>
<p>May 88.500 87.625 Down 0.875</p>
<p>July 89.500 88.750 Down 0.750</p>

<h3>Long-Grain Rice Plunges, Then Rebounds Heavily; Saigon No. 3 Rice Also Drops by 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer demand for foreign rice was still active. However, recently only inland merchants are handling the loading, while local and Yangtze merchants are watching. Demand from the northern merchants is limited. Yesterday, 50,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 and No. 3 rice arrived, and some owners lowered prices to sell. Although inland demand was active, prices were tight. Saigon No. 3 rice immediately fell by 10 cents, and other foreign rice fell by 5 to 6 cents across the board. After the price reduction, the market became active again, with over 10,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 and No. 3 rice traded, and 7,000 bags of Siamese small-grain rice. Inghwa Company delivered 350 tons of spot and futures. Ke Xian rice, with limited arrivals and low inventory, managed to hold its ground but only opened at over 300.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of He rice from various merchants in Shanghai South were similar to before, with still over 40 firms arriving (nearly 9,000 "shi" in total). Therefore, people's sentiment became more discouraged, and local sales were even more sluggish, with few large transactions. Sellers with larger stocks were worried about spoilage in the humid weather and panicked, shouting for lower prices, immediately seeing a drop of 0.5 yuan. When customer merchants seized the opportunity to act, with Qingdao and Weihaiwei merchants buying over 1,000 bags, and local merchants continuing to move, prices rebounded by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. However, at the close, local thick long-grain rice had fallen by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and thin rice had been cut by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Looking at the future trend, it seems that after this sharp drop, there may be no further excessive declines, considering the inland supply. As for "Yin Bian Yuan Dun" rice, with continued scarcity, there was no significant impact. The sources of "Nian Lai Hao" from He Xia in Shanghai North and various sales in the market were all stagnant, with spot prices down by 0.1 yuan, thin rice down by a few "fen" to 0.1 yuan, white round rice down by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and other goods also down by nearly 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hankou Bean Market Shows Little Activity; Cheap Prices for Wheel Beans Attract Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow soybean market saw fewer arrivals of Hankou beans due to seasonal factors. However, the inland merchants still had some demand for small-scale soybean milk production, so the price was firmer than other types of beans. Dalian beans were stable, while other wheel beans had thick inventories and abundant arrivals, causing owners to sell off, with prices falling by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. Under the downward trend in prices, factories were prompted to purchase, and the market saw a sudden increase in activity. In total, factories purchased over 4,000 bags of Guidou beans, priced from 3.90 to 3.85 yuan, over 1,000 bags of Caiqing beans, priced at 3.70 yuan, three cars of Quanhe beans, priced from 3.77 to 3.72 yuan, two cars of Bengbu beans, priced at 3.45 yuan, and one car of Haozhou beans, priced at 3.60 yuan. Local inland merchants traded over 100 bags of Andong beans, priced at 5.108 yuan, and one car of Zhonglu Xicheng beans, priced at 4.40 yuan. Over 1,000 bags of Hankou Zhadou beans were traded, priced from 3.93 to 3.88 yuan, and over 200 bags of Hankou Gou beans, priced at 4.05 yuan, and over 100 bags of Hankou Chi beans, priced at 3.74 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Green Tea from Zhejiang Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, local tea firms such as Tongyifeng, Gong Shenghua Tea Company, and other tea warehouses received over 20 bags of new green tea from Shangyu, Xiaoshan, and other areas in Zhejiang Province. The quality was still considered good. However, the selling price of raw tea, calculated by the local market scale, was 74 yuan, and the cost of processed boxed tea would be over 100 yuan. Most tea merchants, due to recent sluggish European sales and the higher exchange rate compared to previous years, telegraphed inland to temporarily suspend purchases.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Daylily Rebounds by About 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Daylily: Recently, with inventories gradually becoming thin and accounts tight, sales have been active. Yesterday, Guangdong and Shantou merchants purchased a total of 100+ bags, priced from 20 to 17 yuan each. Another 100+ bags were opened, priced from 17 to 17.4 yuan each, rebounding by about 1 yuan compared to the previous time. The market trend is steady and firm, with signs of continued tightening.</p>
<h3>New Quanzhou Longan Looks Poor; Land Prices High</h3>
<p>Before, Guanyuan Longan Flower Sprouts in Quanzhou Had Red Leaves and Few Pistils, With Obvious Crop Failure. However, It Is Hoped That the Situation in the Middle Can Change, or Turn Good. According to a Letter From Quanzhou Yesterday, the Situation Remains Bad. Although the Weather Is Gentle, There Are Still Few Pistils. Even If There Are Good, Without Wind, Disaster, and Other Troubles in the Future, According to the Phenomenon Estimated, About the New Round Harvest Is Only One-Fifth, So the Local Market Situation Is Tight.囤户 收采 All Over The Market,陳圓 Skyrocket, Such as Top Grade Goods劃申须三十八九元, Compared With the Here行盘相差 Seven or Eight Yuan More, the 後市 Opportunity, Seems There Is Hope.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: South Korea Prohibits the Import of Armored Scale Insect Plants -- Originally Transmitted to the United States from China</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local Commodity Inspection Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Minister of Agriculture of Yugoslavia has ordered a ban on the import of plants infected with pear wheel scale insect Aspidiotus Perniciosus Comst. This pest is widely distributed, and it was first introduced into California, USA, from China, severely impacting the pear industry. Now, it is also found in Chile, Germany, Australia, Japan, Canada, Hawaii, and the South Pacific Islands. It harms over 500 species of plants, including pears, plums, apples, currants, quinces, apricots, cherries, nectarines, rose family plants, mulberry family plants, ground plants, forest shade trees, and ornamental plants, all of which are susceptible to its infestation. If local merchants have plants to be shipped to South Korea, they must be inspected and certified by the Commodity Inspection Bureau before they can be shipped.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Lead Sheet Declining</h3>
<p>The recent assessment of white lead sheet has been consistently poor. For example, No. 2 is priced at 24 yuan per "dan", No. 3 at 23.5 yuan, No. 4 at 23 yuan, No. 5 at 22.5 yuan, No. 6 at 22 yuan, No. 7 at 21.5 yuan, and Nos. 8 to 10 are all assessed at 21 yuan. Transactions in Nos. 5 and 6 are selling well, while other grades are stagnant and inactive, so people's sentiment is particularly soft. Recently, the money market has been particularly tight, and it will be difficult for the market to recover for a while. However, overseas quotations have risen by over 1 pound, estimated at 18 pounds and 15 shillings per ton. However, traders are not buying because of the lack of sales.</p>

<h3>Vignettes and Personality</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>In general novels and plays, the so-called "expression of personality" has two meanings. One is the expression of the "character's" personality, which is to write the character's demeanor and temperament in the "story" thoroughly, so that the laborer looks like a laborer, the farmer is indeed like a farmer, the young person has the characteristics of a young person, and the old person has the appearance of an old person; moreover, what kind of work the young person is engaged in, how old the laborer is, whether it is a man or a woman, are all described in detail and naturally. The character's beliefs and thoughts are also directly and indirectly revealed at a glance. The second is the expression of the author's own personality; in addition to ideology, it also has relationships with "local color," "era," and "nationality," etc.</p>
<p>Only when the author's own personality is expressed can it be considered a mature work. The personality of a great writer is strong, and it is revealed richly and invisibly; therefore, even if their works are not signed, readers who are accustomed to their other works can recognize them. However, in general novels and plays, the so-called expression of personality is more focused on the first meaning, especially in the new literature; because the purpose is to explore problems, as long as it is written carefully, is rich in "realism," and can arouse the reader's "resonance" and have a positive impact, its value already exists. Moreover, the expression of the character's personality can be deliberately worked on; the author's own personality must be revealed unintentionally, coming from nature, which is desirable but not achievable.</p>
<p>Vignettes do not need to have a fixed "structure," do not need to abide by the "unities," and may as well write according to the author's subjective feelings, changing as the situation changes; of course, the personality of the characters cannot be meticulously described in detail. Moreover, the length is small; short stories will not emphasize the detailed expression of the character's personality like long novels and plays, but rather focus on brevity; moreover, vignettes need to address many points.</p>
<p>According to what has been said above, in vignettes, the character's personality is difficult to express, at least not fluently. So, what about the author's own personality? This is important; it does not need to have a fixed structure, and does not need to abide by the unities, so it seems easy to do. Although it is easy to do, it is difficult to write something wonderful and outstanding. The problem lies precisely in its freedom; everyone can do it casually, and it is difficult to attract attention without uniqueness. Therefore, vignettes must express the author's own personality, which means that it is easy to move people only when there is considerable maturity. General novels and plays, or can use intellectual "techniques" to make them outstanding; but moving vignettes must have a considerable natural expression of emotion.</p>
<p>Some may think that emotion is blind, and that the exploration of life's problems through naturally expressed emotion may lack meaning, or even be wrong. But this is not the case. As long as the ideology held is great and the thought is correct, even if it is revealed unintentionally, it will not be wrong. Originally, a person rich in an idea is also rich in the emotion of this idea; for example, a person rich in revolutionary thought is also rich in revolutionary emotion. A person who holds an ideology is always biased in thought, that is, has a "preconceived notion," and always observes things as if wearing colored glasses. Therefore, for the same horse, a painter always focuses on color and shape, military officers and doctors probably focus on fat and thinness and strength, while biologists focus on the structure and temperament of the limbs.</p>
<p>Because it is a natural expression, without pretense and hypocrisy, it is the true face of the author. Therefore, although vignettes are short, they occupy an important position in the basic principle of literature, "the expression of personality."</p>
<h3>Daqing Mountain</h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>Our group of more than sixty people, divided among four large automobiles, headed towards the Mongolian plains. Leaving the outskirts of Guihua, we entered the long mountain gully in front of the towering Daqing Mountain (Note 1) beyond the border. The water had already dried up, and the large and small green stones jolted us in the cars as we drove over them.</p>
<p>Walking ahead of us were pedestrians wearing tattered and dirty short clothes, each carrying a small bundle on their backs and shoulders - containing all their belongings. For the sake of livelihood, they left their warm homes to cultivate land in the wilderness, plant crops, and do small businesses, only to return home at the end of the year with the few coins they earned to live some happy days. They have a saying, "walking the back mountain (Note 2)." These people are those who walk the back mountain.</p>
<p>The cars drove into the mountain pass, but the two cars behind us suddenly disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>There are not many trees on the mountain. The grass is still withered and yellow, and only a few small willow trees sway in the wind on the hillside; the telegraph poles from Guihua to Wuchuan stand tall on the mountaintops and slopes. Besides the "back mountain walkers" and the occasional ox carts coming from the opposite direction, no sound could be heard in the mountains: only the loud singing of our companions added some liveliness to the silent valley.</p>
<p>After crossing the rocky gully, we arrived at the dam opening, but the two cars behind us still hadn't arrived. After waiting for an hour, several people went down to the hillside at the entrance to look, but they couldn't see a trace of them. One of the cars traveling with us drove away first: so we decided not to wait any longer.</p>
<p>After leaving the village at the dam opening, we hadn't gone far when we saw the car that was waiting for us. Several girls jumped out of the car and sat under a withered tree, worried: "Should we go or not?" Everyone asked. "Let's go, let's go! Let's go to Wuchuan to wait for them!" Finally, we decided on this plan.</p>
<p>Before we had gone two miles, the car had to climb a very steep hillside. At the entrance to the hillside, there were several walls made of rough stones and a few small earthen houses. Several families had white words written on them saying "lodging available." The elderly and some women with bound feet, as well as children, looked at us with surprise, whispering, "Look! Where did so many foreign students come from? Huh! There are even female students who don't wear buns!"</p>
<p>The car roared several times, and some of the "back mountain walkers" ahead climbed up the small path on the hillside and left. The car climbed up the hillside, leaning backwards as if it were about to tip us over. The car moved so slowly, and at a bend in the mountain corner, the girls' car climbed up first. Dirt flew up, rushing into everyone's noses. They waved their handkerchiefs to signal to the people in our car. At this time, I looked down, and my heart couldn't help but beat rapidly. We were almost to the top of the mountain now, and the city of Guihua in front of us was just a dark mass. Thick snow was still piled up in the shady areas of the mountain, and the weather was a bit colder than before.</p>
<p>The car climbed to the highest mountaintop, where the "Obo" (Note 3) stood, and then it was downhill. Here, we could no longer see the city, only the snow on the mountaintops and the white clouds reflecting each other.</p>
<p>Going downhill was a little easier. The car slowly drove down like a snail. We had to be very careful at the turns, otherwise there would be a danger of flipping from the mountain into the ditch.</p>
<p>On the last hillside, a mountain god temple stood there, truly having the aura of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men cannot enter." At the junction of the hillside and the ditch, there were four large characters carved on the rock by Ji Hongwei in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China: "Turning Danger into Safety." Only here did we truly relax.</p>
<p>After going down the hillside, we entered the mountain gully again, but this time there was water flowing gurglingly. The ice had not completely melted, and snow was piled high on the ice. When the mountain wind blew, it actually blew up thin ice like pieces of paper, like small butterflies flying.</p>
<p>By the time we left the mountain gully, it was almost dusk. The color of the land also changed, with red, black, and yellow soil. The low city walls of Wuchuan County appeared before our eyes. Because we were waiting for those two cars, we stayed here for the night.</p>
<p>Note 1, "Daqing Mountain" is the Yinshan Mountains. Note 2, "Walking the back mountain" means people who go to the Mongolian plains behind Daqing Mountain and the villages in Wuchuan County to make a living. Note 3, "Obo" is a Mongolian word, translated into Chinese as a pile of soil, used by Mongolians as a marker.</p>
<h3>Little Beggar</h3>
<p>— Qi Xuan</p>
<p>Still unable to use fate to explain himself,</p>
<p>His mind hasn't turned to this yet.</p>
<p>Understandingly looking at his father's dry, withered lips,</p>
<p>He learned three or five bitter words of a beggar.</p>
<p>Withered yellow face, scorched black hands,</p>
<p>Heaven knows he hasn't touched water in a hundred days;</p>
<p>His face has never seen a smile nor thought of crying,</p>
<p>From birth, he has been in this hazy state.</p>
<p>When other people's beautiful children pass by him,</p>
<p>It doesn't stir up even a slight wave in his mind,</p>
<p>His eyes don't even dare to look up and see,</p>
<p>He's afraid of the dog-beating stick in the adult's hand.</p>
<p>His small stomach is empty and keeps calling out,</p>
<p>The soreness on his kneecaps keeps increasing;</p>
<p>Kneeling all day, he can't even get a few coppers,</p>
<p>In reality, this small life can't last many years.</p>
<h3>Mountain Pastoral (5)</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>The man took the dry tobacco, put it in his mouth, and began to suck hard without using the mouthpiece. His eyes glanced at Boss Qin, who was standing there wanting to come over but not daring to, and said to Lao Chen:</p>
<p>"Is he one of your group?"</p>
<p>"No, just traveling on the same road!" After Lao Chen replied, he shouted loudly: "Hey, Boss Qin, come over and take a rest!"</p>
<p>And he called out the three words "Boss Qin" especially loudly, as if deliberately trying to make people notice.</p>
<p>Boss Qin slowly walked over, revealing a look of surprise and unease.</p>
<p>The man saw that Boss Qin was limping as he walked, and only after he had come close did he ask:</p>
<p>"Hey, has this friend of yours not walked a long road before?"</p>
<p>"Heh, sir, how can he be like us selling our strength: grinding our bones and nourishing our intestines. He's a big boss doing foreign goods business, can't you tell?"</p>
<p>At this point, even Lao Chen pretended to be a coolie. Boss Qin, hearing that he was being flattered under such circumstances, was like an apprentice who had been slapped by his master, and quickly put on a look of complaining and protested:</p>
<p>"Me, how can I look like a boss? My mouth and eyes don't match up at all! I'm just helping people with their accounts. Speaking of it, I'm also helping others, doing whatever they tell me to do. How can I compare to you doing small business? With your own capital, no one dares to interfere! How dare us abacus bead counters even hum a breath in front of the big bosses?"</p>
<p>Boss Qin's eloquence was not weaker than others, and in addition to defending himself, he also tried his best to expose Lao Chen's pretense of being a coolie.</p>
<p>The man seemed to dislike hearing these words and took the tobacco branch off to ask Lao Xu:</p>
<p>"Hey, do you have any pastries for sale?"</p>
<p>Lao Xu blushed and answered awkwardly, while unconsciously scratching his ear.</p>
<p>"No, I just carry some odds and ends, not worth even a copper, even if I dropped them on the side of the road, I'm afraid no one would even look at them!"</p>
<p>The man flicked off a bit of ash from the tobacco branch, repeated placing it in his mouth, and took a big puff, closing his eyes tightly, as if the deliciousness of the tobacco had made him completely forget that there were other people in front of him.</p>
<p>Lao Chen had been glaring hatefully at Boss Qin, but at this moment he turned his gaze and looked at the man's face, asking worriedly:</p>
<p>"May I ask what kind of business you are in, sir?"</p>
<p>The man opened his eyes and asked back with a smile:</p>
<p>"Take a look, what kind of business am I in?"</p>
<p>"Hmm!..."</p>
<p>Lao Chen blushed and couldn't answer.</p>
<h3>Crossing the Huai River</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>The wheels rolled over the uneven stone-paved small streets, making me feel sick in my stomach from the bumps in the car.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the wharf, I breathed a sigh of relief, got out of the car, and walked down to the small steamer with Mr. Ji. Looking inside and outside the cabin, the deck, and the stern, it was all full of passengers. I asked the boatman to find us a place to stand, and after thinking for a moment, perhaps because we were wearing long robes, he almost treated us very favorably, leading us to a small room that was the accounting clerk's living quarters on the boat. The volume could seat four or five people, and now it was comfortable enough for the two of us to sit inside.</p>
<p>It was already nine o'clock, but the boat kept whistling and didn't leave.</p>
<p>There must be a reason for not leaving!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a boatman poked his head in through the window and said to us: - Please sit outside!</p>
<p>- Strange, you asked us to come in! Is there a free place outside? Why are you saying this?</p>
<p>- We are not leaving because we are waiting for an official, and this room is to be given to the official to sit in.</p>
<p>This really made us angry.</p>
<p>- No way, you can invite the official to sit with us, we won't leave. I said to him.</p>
<p>Because the official hadn't arrived yet, the boatman went away with a lingering face. After a while, he poked his head in through the window again, with an almost pleading expression.</p>
<p>- Please... please sit outside! The official is coming soon.</p>
<p>- You invite the official in, we can all sit together, there are enough seats!</p>
<p>- No, the official has guards, the official should sit alone.</p>
<p>- Nonsense, where is there a regulation that this small room on your boat should only be for officials to sit in.</p>
<p>We finally didn't leave. I thought to myself, I really don't know what kind of remarkable official this is, an official riding a boat, kicking out the common people, being an official always has prestige; but we two are too detestable, not afraid of officials, this is really a bit unimaginable.</p>
<p>The sailing time had been delayed by an hour, but the boat still didn't leave, because the official hadn't arrived yet; the common people on the boat had no choice but to wait bitterly.</p>
<p>Finally, the official arrived after delaying the sailing time by an hour and a half, bringing a small guard who looked like a child, and came to our small room.</p>
<p>It turned out that the so-called official was a company commander of a certain army, wearing a gray old military uniform, with a weathered face, yellow and thin; as if I had known there would be a bad omen, I hurried to let him sit down, but before he sat down, he hummed in his throat, and spat two mouthfuls of thick phlegm onto the deck, almost sticking to the back of my shoes.</p>
<p>He ordered his guard to push our luggage aside, and then lay down to sleep without caring about anything. The boat hadn't even traveled half a mile, and the company commander was already snoring loudly.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Ji and I were a little annoyed. Had we known that such an official was going to come in, we should have let him sit alone, and it would have been more refreshing to stand on the bow and watch the waves!</p>
<h3>Dancing Marathon (5)</h3>
<p>— (By American J.T. Farrell) Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>His dancing was exhausted, and she wrapped her arms around his neck or hips, and rested her head on him, falling asleep. He wearily dragged her around the floor, and when he fell asleep, she did the same to him. Several times, their bodies collided with each other, rocking, pushing, and then he developed a desire for her, and felt her closeness gradually become depressing. Especially when the night was very deep, and the audience in the dance hall was sparse, he noticed deeply that she would often rub her body against him, look hotly into his eyes, and tell him some lewd jokes. Other dancers also became like this. Several told him that he was being made soft all over by some girl.</p>
<p>Day after day, the "Marathon" continued. His eyes were heavy. His back ached. His feet were sore and stiff, and every step he took was painful. He often felt as if he were treading on fire. The dance hall was filled with the persistent mist of cigarette smoke, and permeated with the turbid odor of human bodies. He felt almost entirely dirty, sweaty, and itchy. Dust fluttered into his nostrils and eyes. He had a fit of coughing. His veins stood out. He became a person who was always half-awake, and everything was almost like a dream. Mary also changed. Her hips swelled up. Dark circles formed deeply beside her eyes, and she looked haggard, her face red and swollen, looking like an extremely exhausted prostitute. She energetically dabbed on grease and powder, and her face became a ghostly image of a cartoon-like dancer.</p>
<p>In the beginning, mostly because of his accent and Greek demeanor, Taxis was the subject of many jokes. Several times, people asked him why he didn't work as a waiter in a restaurant, serving customers a plate of beef buns. He got the nicknames "waiter," "water shop waiter," "Socrates," and "beef buns." Gradually, these nicknames had been called for so long that they no longer aroused his anger. Dancing plunged his body and mind into habitual sorrow and pain. He and all the other contestants always longed to breathe some fresh air. During their breaks, if they weren't too tired to move, they would drag themselves like sleepwalkers to the small beds to lean against for a while, or else go into the narrow dressing rooms or unclean toilets, stick their heads out of the windows to breathe some fresh air, and look down at the tireless people walking freely on the streets.</p>
<p>Day after day passed. Sometimes Taxis, Mary, or other contestants went through six hours, twelve hours, a whole day, or even longer, in a daze. After this time, they turned to a crude, struggling state of excitement, and after this state of excitement, they fell into a daze again. Especially when it was very late at night, if they were awake, they often became crude, struggling, and cursing. Sexual desire also became a gradually expanding magic power, sometimes simply going crazy. Being so close to each other, their bodies touching each other so often, they teased each other even more lewdly. Suffering and desire burned fiercely within them. This became a series of tragic mental and physical pains. Like constipation, diarrhea, and sudden dysfunctions of the kidneys and bladder, there was always a contestant walking around the floor or being dragged around sleepily, with wet lines flowing down their pants or the large bloomers that the dancers were used to wearing. Also, bleeding, bruises on the feet. Also headaches, eye diseases, sore throats, fever and chills. Waves of sweating, followed by shivering, chills. This often led back to unconsciousness, the cause of unconsciousness being insomnia and fatigue, various dreams and fantasies, which they used as a process to relieve suffering while they circled on the floor. The end of this process was money, the chance to become famous, sexual desire, clean white sheets, and soft and comfortable beds.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Impoverished China</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>China, which has always prided itself on its vast territory, abundant resources, and large population, is now a bankrupt and dilapidated household. Exactly how much wealth this bankrupt and dilapidated household of ours has has never been accurately surveyed, so it is not very clear. However, according to Japanese statistics, the comparison of the wealth of our country with that of the great powers is as follows:</p>
<p>Country Total National Wealth (Japanese Yen) Average Wealth per Person (Japanese Yen)</p>
<p>United States 762,256,000,000 6,607</p>
<p>United Kingdom 236,320,000,000 5,247</p>
<p>France 103,530,000,000 2,549</p>
<p>Japan 102,343,000,000 1,731</p>
<p>Germany 71,850,000,000 1,441</p>
<p>Italy 44,786,000,000 1,117</p>
<p>China 38,289,000,000 101</p>
<p>What method the Japanese used for this statistics has not been investigated? Whether the figures in the statistical table are reliable is also unknown. If the Japanese statistics are accurate and reliable, then from this statistical table, we can see that the poverty of the Chinese people is truly extreme. The difference in the degree of wealth between our country and the great powers is truly astonishing. In terms of total national wealth, our country is about 20 times less than the United States, and even compared to Japan, it is nearly three times less. In terms of average wealth per person, our country is more than 60 times less than the United States, and even compared to Japan, it is more than ten times less. Of course, the United States is the richest country in the world, how can we compare to them? But we are not only not as good as the United States, even Japan is far ahead of us. Moreover, among these seven countries, our country is the poorest. This cannot but alarm people and cause endless worries about the country's economic future.</p>
<p>There are probably two reasons for China's poverty. One reason is the economic invasion of the great powers. After the Opium War, the country's important gateways were blasted open by foreign cannons. Following the cannons, there was a constant influx of goods from various countries. As a result, China had a huge trade deficit, with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing out every year. This has gradually depleted China's wealth. Another reason is that resources have not yet been developed. China has abundant resources all over the country. However, due to transportation, capital, technology, and other factors, these resources have not yet been developed for human use. This is also the reason why China has not been able to become rich and strong.</p>
<p>For the present plan, to alleviate China's economic difficulties, on the one hand, we should start by revitalizing industry and resisting foreign economic aggression. On the other hand, we must find ways to develop resources as soon as possible. Recently, following the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also promoted a National Economic Construction Movement. The purpose of this movement is to enable China's national economy and people's livelihood to reach a stable state. If this movement is widely implemented, it will surely benefit China's economic future.</p>
<h3>Night on the Qiantang River</h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>The river surface is rendered exceptionally beautiful by the lingering glow of the setting sun, even as those purple small boats with their white sails drift away into the distance! But the emerald peaks and verdant trees along the opposite riverbank, the charming ancient temple pagoda silhouettes, and the gentle smiles of the boat girls facing the tender river breeze, bestow upon this twilight river an endless charm.</p>
<p>However, the setting sun has, after all, set! On the twilight river, only a vast expanse of twilight mist prevails: softly rising up is the singing of little songs by the young lads rowing their boats!</p>
<p>"Set sail!" The owner of our awninged boat shouted at the top of his lungs at the bow of the boat, so that the passengers could get on board sooner. In fact, the cabin was already packed with people, so the boat immediately left the riverbank.</p>
<p>The boat glided forward smoothly and effortlessly on the river, propelled by the late spring breeze. The voyage on this small boat, calculated in time, is only one night. But calculated in distance, it is about thirty miles! When the passengers, having slept overnight on the boat's wooden planks, were awakened by the sounds of oars and paddles, the sun had just half risen above the river surface, and our awninged boat had already safely reached its destination.</p>
<p>In the late spring season, the daytime is often a little sultry; once night falls, especially on the river, even though one is wearing a lined shirt, one feels cool and light. The cabin was crammed with fourteen people, so it was very noisy, but when the bright moon shone directly upon the river's heart, and the silver light spilled onto the faces of the passengers in the cabin, they would rub their weary eyes and say:</p>
<p>"It's late at night!"</p>
<p>And so they would lie down one by one, and before long, they were all joyfully enjoying the pleasure of sleep! But me! I often suffer from insomnia, even when not traveling: thus I quietly murmured to myself:</p>
<p>"Travelers without travel worries are fortunate."</p>
<p>Leaning on the gunwale, listening to the splashing of water beneath the boat, it was very crisp and clear: if my sentiments were more refined, perhaps I would "beat the side of the boat and sing," but alas, I am as dull as a deer or pig, and can only gaze at the moonlit scenery of the Qiantang River!</p>
<p>A patch of azure sky, in the very center of which is set a round moon, perhaps it is too lonely, without a single cloud to accompany it. The river surface evenly rises with tiny waves, forever at an even pace. The surroundings are extremely quiet, sometimes one or two white-feathered waterfowl flap their wings, brushing past the boat awning, leaving behind a sorrowful long cry, trembling the fragile hearts of travelers. The moon sent our boat past Heron Shoal. There, the midnight crowing of village roosters had already been heard, sound by sound; in the village, it seemed someone was carrying a lantern walking at night, and at this time, halfway up the mountain, there also seemed to be two or three points of light, these were probably will-o'-the-wisps!</p>
<p>The cabin brushed past a clump of reeds, and a flock of wild ducks lodging in the reeds all flew up, scattering in a panic. Among them, one, perhaps sleepy-eyed, broke into the cabin, but it immediately realized this was not its place of return, and flew away; but it had strayed too far from the flock!</p>
<p>The night chill pierced the bones, the dew dampened my lined shirt, I believed that tomorrow's morning was near, and so I prepared to pass the remaining small journey in a dream, arriving safely at my home.</p>
<h3>A Son Without Parents</h3>
<p>— Ruizhi</p>
<p>"Savage," was a little playmate of mine when I was a child, and also the son of Battalion Commander Li, who lived next door.</p>
<p>His character was very rough, from childhood he was extremely mischievous, among our group of children, although his age was considered the smallest, he became the leader of our group. He had great strength, was most adept at fighting, so whenever there were fights or wrestling matches with others, he was always at the forefront. He often beat other children, and would not stop until the person being beaten cried. After beating people, he would grin ferociously, and even when facing people he couldn't defeat, he wouldn't yield. Therefore, the children in the vicinity were all afraid of him, and everyone gave him the nickname "Savage." Gradually, even the adults called him "Savage," and his original name was almost forgotten by everyone.</p>
<p>His father was a soldier, and that kind of fierce behavior and character could be seen in his treatment of his son and wife. He would often beat his son or wife so that everyone nearby knew, because of some small matter or because he had drunk a little too much wine. His father's character was completely passed on to "Savage," and was even more severe than his father's.</p>
<p>His mother committed suicide after giving birth to him. His current mother is a prostitute whom his father remarried, because his father was a soldier and was not at home many days of the year, his young mother, who was a prostitute by origin, although she was already around thirty years old, but because she was used to that life of dazzling lights and fine wines, so everyone nearby knew that she was keeping a lover. "Savage" also knew a little about this, so the mother of that lover didn't care much about disciplining him. Because of this, this inherently mischievous child was even more dissolute, making him fully a wild child without any education.</p>
<p>We children called him "Savage" because he was a somewhat uncivilized person, but the adults called him by this nickname for other reasons. I often heard people ask him:</p>
<p>"How did your mother die? Who is raising you?"</p>
<p>When people asked him this, he would be stunned and not know how to answer, he could only loudly answer people:</p>
<p>"Dead is dead, ask my father! Damn it."</p>
<p>His sentences always had to include cursing, especially when asked questions he couldn't answer, he would curse people's parents and ancestors.</p>
<p>The women in the neighborhood also disliked him, and would often be heard cursing him as a savage, a bastard without a father, and other curses.</p>
<p>Although people cursed him like that, he himself didn't understand why. We children also didn't understand why.</p>
<p>Later, I gradually learned that his mother used to be the wife of a villager, and because she was beautiful, she was snatched away by his father. His mother's former husband was also killed by his father. He was not born by his father, but when his mother was snatched away, he was already hidden in her belly.</p>
<p>"Savage" himself didn't know any of this. He always thought his father was his biological father. Although he was very savage, he was still a little afraid when he saw his father.</p>
<p>When he was fifteen or sixteen years old, he was considered to have passed the entrance exam to study at a middle school. He gradually had a sense of being human, but unfortunately he learned about his own background, and knew it more clearly than others. After only studying for two years in middle school, he suddenly disappeared. His father searched everywhere, but still didn't know where he had gone. In a letter to his father, he wrote: "...I am an orphan, my parents were both killed by you, if you hadn't raised me for these ten years, I would have killed you to comfort my biological parents..."</p>
<h3>Boatmen of the Han River</h3>
<p>— Ming Meng</p>
<p>The boatmen of the Han River carry charcoal and firewood, etc., drifting down from the upper reaches of the Han River, far away. Passing through dangerous shoals, rushing through rapid currents, they live under the weight of strong shoulders and arms, until the shoulder pads are scorched black, and long wooden paddles supported on their shoulders form calluses. Only when they reach Xiangzi Bridge can they take a breath. Then they load another kind of cargo from Shantou, and go against the current again, climbing dangerous shoals, rushing through rapid currents, heading straight into the area surrounded by mountains. Life is truly a heavy burden!</p>
<p>Whenever the water rises, the floodwaters at the Xiangzi Bridge stir up huge whirlpools, and the bridge pillars are submerged by the waves. A moment of carelessness, and the boatmen can be smashed to pieces. When the water falls, certain sections of the river will expose the red sand at the bottom, and the heavy weight of the cargo will strand the boat on the accumulated sand. If no one comes to help, using manpower to step into the water and push the boat's hull, the boat simply refuses to move forward. Proceeding through the waterway squeezed between two mountains, a moment of carelessness, and the wooden boat can be shattered by the beach rocks.</p>
<p>However, our Han River boatmen have strong physiques, arms full of strength, and a fighting spirit that fills their whole bodies. They fight with the energy of their lives against nature, struggling with the current, allowing life to continue to exist between this heaven and earth, leaving behind the great achievements of humanity on the vast flow of the Han River.</p>
<p>Our Han River boatmen are also optimistic and accept their fate: lighting a fire on the boat to cook, and having eaten their fill, the great power of life naturally flows out: when working, they hum mountain songs, forgetting their pain. The floodwaters of the Han River are often filled with songs, and the tides at the mouth of the Han River respond to the calls of humanity.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a moonlit night, they step on their own shadows on the embankment of the Han River. Watching the pale white moonlight shining on the floodwaters. The boatmen of the great river flash weak lights, and the boatmen agitate their songs in the air, spreading them to both banks. If they are catching up with the flow of water, the boatmen will still pole at night, unleashing their full energy, sweating all over their bodies,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, casting black shadows on the rippling water. The beauty of nature is unrelated to our boatmen, life separates this class from humanity.</p>
<p>Some park their boats by the shore, and buy a few taels of inferior sorghum mixed with spirits from a hotel near a customs post, barely getting drunk in the turbid current, to forget the pain of the day. Whether this situation is painful or happy, our boatmen themselves probably cannot explain.</p>
<p>Bamboo rafts or logs also float on the floodwaters of the Han River. On a row of rafts, temporary dwellings are built. When the water rises, the rafts naturally rush down like flowing arrows, and that situation is naturally easier to navigate than a heavy wooden boat. But in preventing bridge pillars and dangerous shoals, long rafts are difficult to turn around quickly. Even more pitiful is that if one encounters the water drying up, that navigation will be exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>The boats of the Han River boatmen have a special shape, gradually sharpening the bow and raising it up like the dragon boats in the Dragon Boat Race. To a first-time observer, it seems very interesting, but when our boatmen climb dangerous shoals, this shape can only give them one convenience, to avoid rushing water entering the boat, otherwise they will not feel any interest at all.</p>
<p>Spending a lifetime on the water, grinding their muscles to eat. Now European civilization, however, carries a huge machine power into the interior, and steamboats also come to rampage in the river. Our boatmen already feel the threat to their livelihood, and thinking that one day material civilization will become more developed, where will our boatmen find a place to eat?</p>
<p>Pitiful boatmen of the great river! The fate of Chinese boatmen!</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Job Agency</h3>
<p>— Tianzhen</p>
<p>"No job, stomach rumbling; friends lending money, hard to speak; what to do? - No way out!"</p>
<p>That was a young lad, neither tall nor short, wrinkling his brow, singing softly like this. His feet paced back and forth, as if he had something big on his mind, the room was small, many people were looking at him, laughing at him, like a madman. Even though foreigners were shushing him, he acted as if he didn't hear!</p>
<p>"Are there foreigners too? - Aren't foreigners all rich?" Miss You asked, because the foreigners she saw in the countryside were all full of vigor and seemed rich.</p>
<p>(Aunt Liu moved her chair closer to Miss You, like a mother scolding her daughter.)</p>
<p>This is the Sino-Foreign Job Agency! Aren't there any poor foreigners? There are countless Russian bums: old women, old men. There are also many Chinese people!</p>
<p>"If there weren't so many foreigners, it would be easier for us to find work." Miss You, who had just arrived, saw Shanghai with gold shining all over the place, but after Aunt Liu said this, her heart was poured with cold water, and she turned to resent the unemployed foreigners.</p>
<p>Easier? Not necessarily. First, you have to understand foreign languages, second, you have to be young and beautiful, then they want you. Also, doing things for foreign families is very troublesome! Really.</p>
<p>In the countryside, Aunt Liu lived next door to Miss You, so Miss You naturally trusted her words, and she was an "old Shanghai hand," relying entirely on her instructions: "I heard some can speak Chinese, - don't you speak foreign languages?"</p>
<p>Understanding is naturally good! Like me, if I don't understand clearly, I get scolded, and I lose my job, - you don't know, last year, I changed three employers. Foreigners are really troublesome, they use too much money, or else, they say you stole it, but the clothes have to be changed every two days: for the side dishes, when it's our turn, there's only cold soup and bones to gnaw on, if you leave a little dish in advance, and he sees it, he'll make a big fuss; especially when a guest comes, he's always uneasy, afraid of eating his food, and every time a guest comes, you have to endure a scolding. I advise you, it's better to work for Chinese families.</p>
<p>"I heard foreign families are willing to pay." Miss You's original intention was that because foreigners have a lot of money, that's why she ran out of the countryside; in fact, the original vegetable growing life was barely enough to keep her warm and fed. But you have to be young and beautiful, what to do, she didn't quite understand: "What do you need to be beautiful for? If you can do things, not being deaf or mute is enough."</p>
<p>Beautiful, you just have to be beautiful, foreigners are no good, damn it!</p>
<p>I don't know if it was the heat of the sun shining in from the window, or Aunt Liu felt a little ashamed, but on the face of Aunt Liu, who was almost forty years old, a blush of youth suddenly appeared, she moved the chair away from Miss You a little, Miss You kept looking at her and thought for a while, as if she understood something: "Isn't there a wife? If they're not well-behaved, why don't you tell the wife?"</p>
<p>Tell the wife? You don't understand what they're saying, the result is just that you suffer, either you're scolded and beaten, or you lose your job! The reason for changing three employers last year, half was not understanding the language, half was...</p>
<p>"Are you still beaten? Then how long have you worked here?"</p>
<p>Six months. ...Not beaten? You're not allowed to cry even if you're beaten.</p>
<p>Miss You knew everything about how she could last six months here. Thinking about having to be beautiful, Miss You saw a few black moles on her face in the reflection on the window glass, which seemed to have spread? Looking at the older Aunt Liu, her hair was shiny, and her clothes were very neat, much more beautiful than herself. So she was even more disappointed.</p>
<p>(Silence locked the kitchen, the water on the stove bubbled and called. Aunt Liu got up and opened the kettle lid)</p>
<p>(The stairs creaked, and after a while, a foreign man walked out disconsolately, looking at Aunt Liu with a grin, and when he discovered Miss You sitting in the corner, he put on a stern face.)</p>
<p>"Who is she? What is she doing here! ...Get out!"</p>
<p>Miss You saw that Aunt Liu was just cowering, unable to say anything, she quickly winked at Aunt Liu and walked out the back door. The door slammed shut, and the sound of giggling immediately rose in the room.</p>

<h3>Every Star Has a Counterpart of the Opposite Sex</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>This is Hollywood's latest discovery: every star, of either sex, must have an equal counterpart of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>These counterparts, male and female stars, are not only similar in appearance and age, but also identical in their professional and personal lives. Their early environments, past histories, and even their temperaments, romances, and number of marriages are all the same. Isn't this Hollywood's most astonishing new discovery?</p>
<p>Hollywood has a male Clark Gable and must also have a female Clark Gable; it has a female Katharine Hepburn and must also have a male Katharine Hepburn. It is said that every movie star in Hollywood has an equal counterpart of the opposite sex. Even Greta Garbo, who is considered unique, has a male counterpart. The journalist who made this discovery specifically selected eight female stars and eight male stars, matching them up in pairs to prove his strange finding.</p>
<p>The first pair he mentioned was Clark Gable and the Russian actress Anna Sten. If you place their facial profiles side by side, you can see that, apart from Clark Gable's characteristic hair, eyebrows, and mustache, the rest of their eyes, noses, mouths, etc., are all similar. Not only do they look alike, but their early experiences were also largely the same. One in a village in Ohio, the other in a small town in Russia, both suffered hardships in their childhoods. They both started learning acting at the same time. They both married someone who greatly benefited their future but with whom they could not live happily. One married a great Russian actor, and the other married a famous drama instructor. They both divorced in 1928 in two different places.</p>
<p>Later, they both married people older than themselves. They both became famous for their strong and unyielding style. Their temperaments are also the same. They both love the outdoors and being close to nature. They both have healthy physiques. They both like the ordinary and have no exoticism. Finally, their skin tones and the sound of their voices are very similar.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo and Ronald Colman are a pair of cynical actors on the screen. If you put their photos side by side, you can see that they have a surprising resemblance. They both reveal a deep worldly experience. Of course, their experiences came from equally unhappy love affairs. One due to the breakup of her love with Mauritz Stiller, and the other due to the failure of his marriage in England. They both have an unapproachable attitude. Recently, they each purchased property, preparing for retirement. Strangely, nineteen months ago, they left Hollywood at the same time and returned to their respective hometowns, and the difference in the dates they returned to Hollywood to continue working was only ten days. Similarly, when they came back, they would only shoot two films.</p>
<p>The stories of Irene Dunne and John Boles are as similar as can be. They are both in their early thirties, both born in southern Pennsylvania, and both from ordinary families. They both learned singing and dancing at the same time, and both have very good voices, but their voices were not valued by producers and were assigned to supporting roles in dramas. They entered the film industry almost at the same time.</p>
<p>Although their experiences were very similar, they did not know each other until they co-starred in "Back Street." They have each been married once, and to this day, there has never been any talk of divorce in their respective families. Their hobbies are books and music. Their tastes are the same. Irene Dunne is a famous cook in Hollywood, but surprisingly, John Boles is also a famous chef!</p>
<p>Wallace Beery and the late Marie Dressler's appearance, style, etc., can be said to be as similar as can be. They are so similar that there is no need to compare them further. They both became famous after they gained weight and were over forty years old. Both went from comical, minor roles to becoming leading, older characters. In short, they are similar in every way. In terms of appearance, if you change Marie into men's clothing, she would be Wallace; if you change Wallace into women's clothing, he would be Marie. Their kind personalities and charitable behavior are also equally praised.</p>
<p>The remaining pairs of similar male and female stars cannot be described in detail here, but mentioning their names is enough. One pair is Barbara La Marr and Rudolph Valentino. They were born and died at the same time. One pair is Marjorie Evans and Phillips Holmes. One pair is James Cagney and Joan Blondell. And another pair is William Powell and Katharine Hepburn. Please readers note the similarities between them.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Merry King"</h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>All The King's Horses</p>
<p>— Grand Theatre Showing —</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that the makers of general song and dance films always like to cast the main characters in their films as kings, feudal lords, and other nobles, and set the background in palaces, villas, and fortresses. The main reason is that the players of waltz tunes and the objects they serve are all wealthy and leisured classes. Therefore, in order to cater to their tastes and achieve their business goals, the makers of these films rarely choose emperors, dukes, and other figures as the protagonists of the plays. The background that follows is naturally where they live, eat, drink, and play. At the same time, because these films are due to fiction and clumsy lies, the content is often empty. Therefore, they have to use gorgeous backgrounds and dazzling props to try to cover up or confuse people's attention. Therefore, the palaces of the rich and prominent are the most suitable to be used, and the characters that follow are their masters, the nobles. As for the emperor being amorous and the empress being sentimental, these specific personalities are naturally for the convenience of their stories, which cater to the tastes of the wealthy and leisured who like to be amorous and sentimental.</p>
<p>"The Merry King" is the best illustration of the above.</p>
<p>The story is about a King Rudolf who is so busy with state affairs that he has no time to enjoy the pleasures of the palace. Secondly, in accordance with the custom that kings must have beards, he is troubled and inconvenient to kiss and be intimate. Therefore, Queen Irene angrily moves to the summer palace and does not return for years. The emperor is anxious and asks Carlo, a handsome young man and movie star who has won the love of countless girls, for advice on how to make the queen change her mind. The result is that he shaves his beard, lets Carlo act as his representative, and goes to Vienna to have fun and have an affair with a woman named Mimi.</p>
<p>And this Carlo, the fake emperor who looks like Rudolf, causes many jokes in the parliament and in the harem. The queen hears that the emperor has shaved his beard and rushes back to the palace that night, restoring her true love to the fake emperor. The play unfolds in this way. The story is that Carlo, in order to respect the emperor's reputation, uses various methods to avoid "that," thus completing and restoring the old harmony between the emperor and empress.</p>
<p>Such a fictional story has nothing outstanding in terms of screenwriting. The movie star suddenly becomes the king, and even the queen cannot recognize him. This lie is not technical enough and breaks all previous records. Carlo and the queen are dancing happily, and suddenly Rudolf replaces him. She does not even notice it. Also, the king is so busy that he does not have time to accompany the queen, but he can accompany Carlo to sing while playing the piano. This contradiction is also ridiculous enough.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the performance side, the director Frank Tuttle is quite attentive and has achieved considerable results. First of all, the editing is concise and the tone is cheerful. The liveliness of several camera shots is commendable. Second, he is able to put effort into small actions. For example, the first scene shows the queen's loneliness in the palace. She uses flipping through books, stroking the dog, and making shadows on the wall behind the light to pass the time. Only the movement of her hands can explain her mood. The expression when she hears someone knocking on the door and hurriedly dresses up, thinking that the emperor is coming, and the melancholy when she dances alone with the statue in the summer palace all well explain her inner feelings, paving the way for the passionate mood of singing by the window and dancing in the pavilion later.</p>
<p>Several songs and performances are not much different from other films of this type.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting, Carl Brisson plays two roles, the king and the movie star, but in this play, which does not focus on individuality, both are only performed mediocrely. Relatively speaking, Mary Ellis's queen is performed more deeply and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The performance of Jieshimalis and Weiqini Boluosi in the medical science blockbuster "Deadlock" will be shown in Nanjing today for the fourth time.</p>
<h3>Amazing Scientific Invention: Spinal Anesthesia</h3>
<p>The most complex and dangerous event in surgery is the implementation of the operation. Because the life and death of the patient are all hanging in the hands of the surgeon. The urgency of time, the tension of space, and the highest performance of mind and strength are probably fully displayed in this kind of performance. Therefore, doctors dissect the microscopic, compete for the slightest difference, and fight against time, space, and death to regain the most precious and valuable life of mankind. It is indeed necessary to have a steel-like strong wrist and a light-like swift brain. The difficulty of the so-called million-dollar hands can be seen here. But in "Deadlock," starring Jieshimalis, which is currently being shown in Nanjing, he not only saved many lives, but also personally directed the operation, even curing his own incurable disease of having a hole in his abdomen and chest. The spinal anesthesia used and the corrupt content of the medical scum are worth the great attention of the community. In particular, the great star Jieshimalis, who is famous for his strong and powerful personal performances, this is his most proud work since "Waterloo Bridge." The heroine Weiqini Boluosi (Virginia Bruce) (Note: Weiqini is the wife of Joan Gilbert. She has been retired from the film industry for a long time after marriage. This time she made a comeback in "The Sale of Savage Heads" and played a singer, and she is still praised by fans. It goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Carl Brisson's New Film, Full of Talent and Artistry</h3>
<p>— Man Man</p>
<p>Carl Brisson was originally a popular singer on the European stage. He was recruited by Paramount to Hollywood and starred in "Murder at the Vanities." After its release, it won the enthusiastic welcome of millions of fans. In particular, the song "Cocktails For Two" is still popular in the United States.</p>
<p>Brisson has a gentle and elegant manner, and like Ramon Novarro, he seems to be a typical talent, that is, what we call a "handsome young man." Who would believe that he is also a boxer? But, in fact, he does have a study of boxing. Although he has never formally fought in a ring in Europe, his reputation for being good at boxing is not less than his reputation as a singer. German Crown Prince Wilhelm once learned boxing from him. After he arrived in Hollywood, no matter how busy he was with filming, he always had to spar with the boxer he brought with him for one or two rounds every day. He can really be regarded as a loyal believer in the boxing world.</p>
<p>Recently, he starred in a song and dance film called "Two Hearts in Waltz Time" in London. Whether this film will be shipped to China for release in the future, we can only wait and see.</p>
<h3>Another Literary Film: Dickens' Last Work "The Mystery of Edwin Drood"</h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>This year, literary films are really in their prime. In the past month alone, quite a few literary films have been shown in Shanghai. Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" was shown at the Nanjing Grand Theatre not long ago, but Dickens' "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" has been filmed by Universal and will meet us at the Grand Shanghai.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was a famous British novelist. In his early years, his life was very difficult. He relied entirely on his own strength to become a famous writer. For this reason, he wrote mostly about his own experiences and was known for his descriptions of the lower and middle classes of society. He wrote many works throughout his life, and quite a few have recently been adapted into films by Hollywood film companies.</p>
<p>"The Mystery of Edwin Drood" was the last novel he wrote in 1870, but unfortunately, he passed away before he could finish it. The story is about a clergyman who is highly trusted in society, but his private life is marred by the bad habit of smoking opium. One Christmas Eve, his nephew suddenly disappears during a storm. But everyone knows that the young man's disappearance was due to his rival in love murdering him. It took a lot of trouble to uncover this secret case. Although it is a detective-style film, there are also quite a few jokes in it!</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Claude Rains, who starred in "The Passing of the Third Floor Back," plays the leading role. The story is very suitable for Rains, so his performance allows him to fully display his talent. After Rains starred in "The Passing of the Third Floor Back," American film audiences said that he had the potential to win the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1934. Although he lost, his art has been making rapid progress in recent years, which we cannot deny.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Living on Velvet (Part Six)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Aimeé looked surprised and wanted to ask Thorley what he was doing. Thorley said with a gun, "I want to build an airplane hangar. I want to do business." Aimeé said, "What do you want to do?" Thorley said again, "I want to do business. Listen to me. I want to buy an airplane... a seaplane. I can carry the people living in the countryside here to and from the city and the countryside... I can park it in the river, right at the mouth of the waterfront street. It takes them an hour and a half by train, but it only takes them fifteen minutes by plane. This is guaranteed to make money. Of course, I'm afraid I'll lose some money in the first year. But it's guaranteed to make money in the future... Besides, I can go to the sky again!"</p>
<p>Aimeé said, "Thorley, how much does that plane... cost?" Thorley took a pencil from his pocket, picked up an old envelope, and started calculating. He said, "Of course... the cost is more than just the price of the plane... I also need to rent more land... to level it... to build a hangar... workers... equipment... In addition, there is also the salary of your airfield manager, etc.... I hope you will also forgive me for not being able to pay a large salary."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he looked up at Aimeé, but Aimeé remained silent, as if she did not approve. So Thorley continued, "Calculating like this, the total is ten thousand one hundred seventy-one dollars and sixty-seven cents. Don't be stunned like that, Aimeé. After we pay the bills and buy things, we still have eight thousand dollars... Let's think of a way to get two thousand dollars more, and that's not a difficult thing..."</p>
<p>He did build an airplane hangar and bought an airplane. One sunny afternoon, Aimeé performed a naming ceremony for it with a bottle of persimmon jam. After this simple and pitiful ceremony was over, Thorley got on the plane himself, wanting to fly around with Aimeé in the sky, but Aimeé refused.</p>
<p>"I'll go alone," Thorley said. "I'll be down in a minute... about ten minutes will be enough." His face showed impatience, eager to compare himself with the sky. That had become his nature. Aimeé had no choice but to agree, "Go ahead."</p>
<p>Thorley flew alone in the sky for a while and then came down. But when he returned home, he saw Aimeé wearing her going-out clothes, sitting on a large leather bag. He stopped, looked at her, and asked her what she was doing. Aimeé said simply, "I'm leaving you." Thorley said, "Take off those clothes, it's time to prepare dinner now." He forced a smile, but Aimeé said seriously, "Before I leave, I want to say something to you. Your attitude towards life and the world is really too difficult. I know you have a void in your life, a very obvious and terrible void. When I married you, I thought I could fill that void... but I didn't. I'm no longer worthy to be your wife."</p>
<p>Thorley shook his head slightly and said, "You really know how to talk, but... you can't leave. You... you can't deprive me of my life. I think you're a very good wife... really." Aimeé's eyes were full of tears. She said, "I wanted to be able to help you, but I couldn't help you... Alas, Thorley... because I love you so much... I can't help but leave you." Thorley pleaded, "Hate me if you want, but please don't go. Listen to me, Aimeé... I love you... I love you... (To be continued)</p>
