<h3>申新七廠拍賣事件</h3>
<p>— 彦</p>
<p>值此滬市百業蕭條。工商金融各界方奔走於救濟市面之際。不意英商匯豐銀行竟以第一受押人資格。委託魯意斯摩洋行公告拍賣申新紗廠第七廠之廠基房屋機器。以價值五百萬元以上之産業。僅標二百二十五萬元之限價。雖經中國上海兩銀行亦以債權人資格向第一特區法院申請假扣押。而得法院裁定實施。並經市商會等公團之電請中央設法制止。以維護産權實業。然而在特種勢力之下。已於昨日為日人村上律師代表某方以最低標價拍去。我人以為匯豐銀行此舉。若在景氣時期。尚可不加非難。然公表於銀根奇緊之今日。則不得不引為莫大之遺憾。而認為含有嚴重之意義。</p>
<p>溯自遠東局勢緊張。英人以各方所見歧異。對華政策未能一致。在華陣綫。頗見零落。其以匯豐銀行為代表之一派。採取放棄華北長江流域利權之策略。移存滬現金於香港。以保實力而靜待政治之發展。惟以運現過甚。庫存稍虚。去年曾一度釀成提存風潮。雖不久即平靜無事。然若非華商各銀行相助。消弭或未必如是之速。嗣該行當局為備華人提存之綢繆。乃有吸收現金之計劃。停發已久之鈔票。作再度推行。並利用各洋行為之間接使用。到期存欵復以高利誘之。使勿外流。凡此皆該行策略之表顯於事實者。</p>
<p>職是之由。我人以為匯豐銀行之拍賣申新七廠。實為貫澈其最近對華策略之必經階段。其目的所在。或非僅申新七廠一户而已。而不幸之「申七」竟犧牲於彼輩牛刀初試之下。倘自匯豐銀行之立塲言之。若非採用此種非常手段。則其在滬市方面之債權。無由迅速了結。其所以亟亟岀此者。似亦自有其苦衷。然其漠視産權。斷然不顧之態度。令人不無談虎而色變。增進中英友誼。以利商業。當為一般英商所希望。如何挽救漠視産權之失策。實今日英商方面所宜注意者也。我金融業者於此似亦應有相當之凖備。設我銀錢兩業。一味兢兢於實力之保持。而無具體之對策。竊恐今後民族工業。將益少保障矣。</p>

<p>［巴黎］今晨舉行閣議時、由總統勒白崙主席、討論内政外交各案甚多、外長賴伐爾氏將乘機向同僚報告與奧總理休樞尼格之談話及巴黎與倫敦柏林間之一切外交談判、並將討論英外相巴黎之行、因法國政府雖認此行係私人性質、便將乘西門與之逗留巴黎之際、交換意見是也、西門氏本定星期四晨來法、惟若干報紙載稱、西門已將行期提前而於星期三抵此云、同時賴伐爾先後延見南斯拉夫捷克及希臘公使、彼等皆係探詢法當局與奧賓之談話者、此項訪問適在奧賓行後、於此足見小恊約國對於法奧之談判頗為重視、據聞德外長曾告各使、謂法奧談判已趨一致、據報載則謂關於多瑙河公約中之問題已達成熟地步、而奧國與夫隣國之合作、亦頗有告成功之希望云云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>法名記者懷疑英國態度</h3>
<p>［巴黎］今日法國外交政治名記者波丁那氏在巴黎廻聲報披露論文、對於英外相西門之訪問柏林與德直接談判、頗致憤懣之詞、據波氏之預測、英外相抵德之後、將給與德國某種之讓步、惟該項讓步實為法國所難以容納者云、並據波氏稱、德國於英國接受其邀請之時、即已佔得第一步勝利、而英法談話之力量、即為英德意見交換所平衡、而使英國踞有羅迦諾條約精神上公正仲裁人之地位云、並據波氏觀察中、此次英外相訪德、與英國國内之選舉亦不無關係、故勢必略有成績、至少在外表上必具成功之形式云、波丁那指英外相之態度、係屬「不穩定」方面者、至對於彼所謂某種讓步、則謂此後局部條約、勢將失去互助及軍事恊定等等成份、而此等成份實屬現在討論中之諸協約有不可或缺者也、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>英報表示慶幸［倫敦］泰晤士報評論西門外相柏林之行、認為可慶幸之事、謂「方今歐洲時局嚴重、逈非尋常可比、英國既能運用其勢力、俾各關係國均能接受二月三日英法兩國倫敦宣言所建議各節、則西門外相柏林之行、其理由自易了解、」保守黨右派晨郵報、對於西門外相前往柏林莫斯科之議、似已不復反對、其言曰、「東方一旦發生衝突、西方即不能不受影響、無論何人苟稍具常識者、必有以承認之、然則英國若遣派政治家、俾在柏林莫斯科之間担任調解、實為適宜之舉、」極端派保守黨每日快報始終採取反對態度、謂「英國閣員前往德俄兩國、究竟懷有何種希望、而能有何成就乎」云云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奧揆訪英目的</h3>
<p>求財政軍事上援助</p>
<p>抵抗德國勢力東進</p>
<p>［倫敦］奧國外長魏德格今日聲稱、德奧兩國如欲維持親善關係、則國社黨必須停止干涉奧國之事務云、魏氏此言、係彼抵此後特别接見美聯社記者時所發、魏氏並稱、「奧國之獨立業已確定、故吾人殊不懼德國再來干涉奧事、至於兩國間之親善關係、則惟有德國當局放棄一切對奧要求、始能恢復、以後除非奧國被認為平等獨立之國家、吾人即不願對於奧事再有討論、惟如本此原則舉行會議、以解决外交上之困難則吾人當樂於參加、再如德國接受此種案件、則吾人亦甚樂於恢復正常關係」云、此間盛傳休樞尼格與魏德格二氏來英之真正目的、係欲英國允許哈布斯堡皇室復辟、據官方宣布會議性質、係奧國請求英國允許援助奧國政府抵抗國社黨及共産黨之勢力、於必要時給以財政上或軍事上之援助、另有一説則謂休氏此行係欲在英舉債、故已預定與英國國家銀行總裁諾門亦將會晤一次、半官方面對於魏氏之上述談話頗為注意、據稱、觀此可知奧國政體將無所變更云、（廿六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>英奧談話大致與巴黎談話同</h3>
<p>復辟借欵兩問題未提及</p>
<p>［倫敦］英奧談話所討論之問題、與巴黎談話所討論者完全一致、其所獲結果、亦與法奧談話之結果大體相同、即承認奧地利共和國在無論何方面、均應保持完全獨立是也、本日奧國總理休樞尼格·外長魏德格·與英國外相西門·外部常務次長汪西泰·舉行談話、歷時頗久、談話主要部分、係關於不干涉奧國内政公約之一事、經奧國方面説明、奧國倘遭外國干涉時、則簽約國均可直接與奧國磋商、非簽字國亦可經國聯會之媒介、與奧國磋商云、此次英奧談話、雖僅係探聽消</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>息之性質、實則極關重要、多瑙河公約將為英德柏林談話主要問題之一、今西門外相赴德之前、與奧國閣員舉行談話、可因此明瞭奧國之地位、實大有裨益也、至關於哈布斯堡皇室復辟·增加奧國借欵及陸軍軍額等問題、則英奧談話中悉未提及、英格蘭銀行總裁諾曼、本日雖曾拜訪奧國總理休樞尼格、惟所談者係關於奧國舊有各項借欵、如國聯會經手奧國借欵等問題、又一般人相信本日午後休樞尼格與英國財相張伯倫會見時、曾討論是否可由英國墊付欵項、使奧國得向英國採辦鐵道材料、用以革新奧國鐵路之設備云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奧揆宣稱政制不擬變更</h3>
<p>［倫敦］奧總理休樞尼格頃對國際報界代表宣稱「吾人不因建設奧國而採取獨裁制、此種演進、實與吾人天性相反、吾國絶無一人盼其實現者、」休氏嗣論及奧國國力、謂奧國若能與外國通有無、自可獨立生存、無須與他國聯立云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報評論暴露希黨對奧用心</h3>
<p>謂奧政府不足代表民意</p>
<p>［柏林］半官式之德國通信社、評論奧國總理休樞尼格外長魏德格在法國所發表之宣言、謂次項宣言、頗為德國人民所驚異、蓋奧國政府、並未代表奧國人民、其基礎脆弱、可於此見之也、奧國政府深懼舉行公民投票、倘舉行公民投票、則政府必為大多數人民所推翻云、此種論調、當岀於國社黨之授意、國社黨對於奧國之用心、於此可見一斑、蓋國社黨以為奧國如舉行公民投票、則國社黨必可獲得大多數也、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法内長受右派指摘</h3>
<p>因保護友邦代表欠週到</p>
<p>［巴黎］近日右派報紙對於内長雷格尼頗為不滿、其原因為奧總理休樞尼格日前訪問巴黎之時、法當局竟不能與以相當之保護、致休氏未能於星期日參加勝利聖母教堂之彌撒、蓋法内長事前接得密報、謂有人陰謀暗殺奧總理、内長即向休樞尼格勸告届時勿前往禮拜云、並據人民和洽報所載、此項陰謀確為事實、警察當局已自可靠方面接得報告稱、「危險份子」已抵法京、將對於奧總理有所不利云、勝利報則嚴斥内長雷格尼之勸告奧總理勿參加彌撒、為「愚拙無禮」之行為、因禮拜堂中法政府中要人如司法部長彼諾氏等均在恭候也、巴黎廻聲報則稱、法政府對於奧總理之秘密抵法、已僨事於先、乃於友邦代表蒞法之後、復無法與以身體安全之保障、一誤再誤、殊令人難以置信云、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>美海軍根據地增强實力計畫</h3>

<p>［華盛頓］衆院海軍委員會頃以十四票對一票之多數、通過議案、准許海軍部進行增强美國海軍根據地之計畫、沿加拿大巴拿馬及太平洋岸各海軍根據地均須增加實力、經費共計三千八百萬美元、其中一千五百萬美元用以建造夏威夷珍珠港之潛水艇及航空根據地、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］衆院海軍委員會今日已通過贊成撥欵美金三千八百萬元、改建美國西海岸·巴拿馬運河區·及夏威夷羣島之海軍船塢、該會亦核准海軍無須取得國會之特别准許、即可將改良軍艦之欵項增加一倍、按現有規定、海軍改良任何軍艦、於二年以内每艦不岀三十萬元、即無須請求國會核准、兹該會已准此數以後加至六十萬元、至於改良船塢之議、海軍專家久已視為非常重要、若干官塲則以為美國必須准備、隨時可以建造大批軍艦、歐戰時之缺乏船隻即可作為殷鍳、若干專家謂政府改良船塢之後、可以節省糜費、因國家自造、較之臨時招商承造、價格可以便宜、惟各方對於此點、意見頗有岀入云、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<p>意阿談判僵持中</p>
<p>墨西那　意國政府繼續計劃對於阿比西尼亞大舉進攻、今日復有軍隊數千及戰具無數在此起程、意國全境之戰争情感已成白熱、軍隊開岀之時、千萬民衆皆往船埠摇旗歡送、並以鮮花香烟及糖菓等物分贈慰勞、那泊爾亦有一船載工兵一千二百人及軍火甚多開往東菲、按意國此次派兵前赴意屬索瑪里倫、前後已達六千以上、尚有萬人準備開拔、目前此項軍隊之責任、祗為協助當地土兵二萬五千人保護邊境、以防阿國擾亂、阿國方面亦已集中軍隊七萬五千至十萬人待命進攻、阿國官塲已屢次抗議意國之續遣重兵、指為係挑釁行動、國聯委員會在阿京開會、亦仍竭力設法阻止雙方發生衝突、惟阿國迄今仍以不經意之態度對付此事、阿王仍稱彼將信賴國聯及彼之軍隊保護阿國、不受意國侵犯、因此益使意國官塲震怒、兹意國已下令於必要時、將徵發商船聽候軍用、觀此則備戰之亟、更進一步矣、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］二月十日由那泊爾港乘阿根廷號郵船開往東菲洲之汎繫黨軍第一營、頃已在意屬愛里德里之瑪薩華港登陸、當經整隊開入市内、人民夾道予以歡迎、柏羅新羅那師未開拔之部隊、亦已於由墨西拿港開往東菲、陸軍次長貝斯德羅奇本日赴加泰拿及西拉宼沙兩地廵閲軍隊、最後返墨西拿、校閲候船待發之各部隊、「比安喀麥諾伯爵號」已於今晨由那泊爾港開抵墨西拿、將載兵士二千六百人、軍械三千噸開往東菲、墨西拿港主教貝諾登船致送别辭、並為該船及船員祝福、當該船啓椗時、岸上羣衆大聲歡呼、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］意大利與阿比西尼亞之談判、迄未成立何種協定、按意國前向阿比西尼亞提議、在意阿兩國前哨相距六公里之地設置中立地帶、以避免雙方衝突、阿國已接受此項提議、但附帶一條件、即應准許阿國游牧人民自由通過中立地帶、蓋因有多數泉井、均在中立地帶故也、此項條件亦經意國接受、惟阿國要求由比利時及瑞典軍官各一員、參加中立地帶勘界代表團、則經意國加以拒絶、據若干外國方面消息、阿國現已放棄此項要求、羅馬方面則尚未得訊、僅謂此事業在阿國京城進行談話、惟是否獲有結果、則所未悉、又據外國方面消息、謂阿國要求提交仲裁、意大利未予以答復、此間人士則謂阿國要求提付仲裁之照會、於二月二十三日甫經遞到、意國現正起草答復、意國方面意見、以為解决兩國争端應分三種步驟、第一步直接談判、未成則由第三國居間和解、和解又不成、方可提付仲裁、現在意阿兩國已在阿京開始直接談判、則當然談不到仲裁云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>停戰期限昨日届滿</p>
<p>巴國强梁為世唾棄</p>
<p>［華盛頓］巴拉圭今日堅持在人烟絶跡之區、繼續進行戰事、致為世界所唾棄、被斥為强梁之國家、今日為玻巴兩國三月停戰期限届滿之日、國聯之裁决將不直巴拉圭、但巴國官員對於國聯會員國或將採嚴峻制裁、事前已有所聞、故已於星期六晚退岀國聯矣、同時得悉兩國仍將在大厦谷繼續進行零星局部戰事云、按大厦谷戰事種因於一八七九年、其地位於巴拉圭及畢爾康至河流之間、水道交义、為一佈滿昆虫之大三角形地、縱六百英里、横三百英里、玻巴兩國各據理由要求該地、該地在四面皆陸之玻璃維亞視之、為入海之唯一要道、玻璃維亞西距太平洋雖僅七十五英里、但重山曡障、交通為不可能、巴拉圭對於該地亦虎視耽耽、因其面積甚大、事實上將使巴國土地之面積增加一倍也、且荒源之中産某種植物甚多、其樹皮可供提煉百分之三十之樹皮質、一九三二年十九國代表會集華盛頓、籌議解决争端之辦法、時因戰事犧牲生命之士兵已有一萬人、嗣後該問題移交國聯辦理、國聯通告雙方戰争必須儘昨日結束、巴拉圭之退盟即係國聯通告所得之答復也、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<h3>論贑岸鹽倉，建於九江，湖口；不如建於九江，吴城。（續）</h3>
<p>— 喻仲標</p>
<p>三　吴城建倉之利</p>
<p>吴城合於建設倉坨，有歷史，地理，及其他種種關係，分五點説明如左；</p>
<p>（一）就運銷上言利。吴城當贑省河流之總匯，已如上述，尤以修水，銅鼓，武甯，奉新，靖安，安義，等縣為最便。倘建倉於此，則以上各縣之帆運，無中途設棧之費，有一帆直達之利，於商於航，兩得其便，勝湖口多矣。然説者謂：「帆運不能涉險而至湖口，江輪獨能揭淺以至吴城：商運不能中途設棧，官航獨可臨江轉儎乎？是便私而不便公，亦一偏之議也。」不知政府正在積極疏濬河道，如撫河已由蔣委員長指令江西省政府計劃就緒，派定經流各縣，分工疏濬，鄱湖為總理建國方略所定，安可任其淤塞？不過功程較大，時間較緩耳。將見疏濬之後，江輪且可以直達南昌，何論吴城？即以目前而論，江輪僅秋冬水落之時，不能直駛吴城，若春夏江水洋溢，固暢行無阻也。將來在河道未疏濬以前，利用春夏之水，預儲秋冬之鹽，亦安見其不公私兩利也？</p>
<p>（二）就建倉經費上言利。吴城歷為江右引岸，所以鹽倉林立，將來由政府租或買，陳舊則加以修理，不敷則從事擴充，吾意舊鹽商與其坐令傾圯，亦不至居奇不售，如此則費半倉成，事半功倍，較之湖口鑿石填窪，憑空構築者，其省工惜費為何如也？</p>
<p>（三）就地勢安全上言利。吴城地居贑中，四面環水，純為一商業埠岸，若以安全言，誠為江西任何地方所不及，證以頻年赤匪，蹂躪全省，八十餘縣，舉無净土，獨吴城翛然世外，儼若桃源，商旅安枕，雞犬不驚，益足徵信。若建倉屯鹽於此，將見不須守衛，不勞寶藏，無城而為有城，無險而實天險，金城湯池，恐無逾此。</p>
<p>（四）就推銷土産上言利。江西大宗土産，如紙，如蔴，如木，向例集中吴城，且紙，蔴，都産於贑北，（木材亦不在少數。）而傾銷於長江一帶，往往帆運土産至吴，滿載食鹽以去；輪運鹽斤至吴，轉儎紙，蔴，以往。（近年木材，亦多用船載運岀江者。）輪帆往返，俱不空勞，既利船民，亦隆實業。值此土匪肅淸，百業凋殘，亟謀善後之日，舉凡可以裨益民生者，似宜極力扶植，以期斯民早登袵席，永弭匪患。</p>
<p>（五）就工人生計上言利。吴城直接間接倚鹽為生者，無累數萬人，一旦遷倉湖口，此數萬人值此生活高壓之時，驟失憑依，庸懦者固難逃於餓莩，桀黠者將挺入險途，政府已飢已溺，胡忍岀此？然説者謂：「建倉湖口，亦需工人，不忍吴城工人之斷絶生機，獨願湖口工人之瀕於失業乎？」是又不然，湖口無鹽，湖口之工人未必無食，有則所謂「錦上添花」耳；吴城去倉，吴城工人之衣食，則真隨鹽俱去，與其絶食而施食，，何如各得其食之為愈也？且政府雖厲行洵汰帆運，然觀於行政院通過運鹽辦法大綱，對於被抽船工，有開辦紙廠，介紹職業，移民就工各欵之規定，亦可見政府之關懷工人也。</p>
<p>四　結語</p>
<p>準上各論，如運銷之便否，經費之繁省，地勢之安危，最關重要，即其餘諸端，雖為著者推論所及，然國家大政，關係綦重，苟在可能範圍，自當通盤籌算，蓋能計岀萬全，斯能利賴百世。著者生長於斯，利害得失，情形較晰，若當道建倉湖口之議，或係岀於急就，尚有待於徐參，則於區區蒭蕘，尚其垂意焉是幸。（完）</p>

<h3>滙豐銀行昨卒拍賣申新第七廠</h3>
<p>不顧第一特院假扣押</p>
<p>由日商豐田紗廠承受</p>
<p>中央社云、申新紡織公司所屬楊樹浦路四六八號第七廠、總值約五百萬元、七年前曾向英商匯豐銀行抵押二百萬元、年息八厘、每年付息金十六萬元、七年間、累計已達一百十二萬元之鉅、到期後、適值紡織業衰落之際、致無法歸還、申新方面、雖願償還一部分債欵及全部利息、向匯豐銀行再三墾商、而匯豐銀行方面、仍斷然委託魯意師摩洋行、公告於昨日午後三時半、在北京路四川路口該行拍賣、計該廠地屋内機器、限價二百二十五萬元拍賣、惟該廠已於昨日上午、由第二債權人中國上海兩銀行、向法院聲請假扣押、此項拍賣、在法律上當然失其根據、兹分誌拍賣情形及各方應付消息如下、</p>
<p>七廠歷史　國聞社云、申新第七廠、以前原屬日商、名東方紗廠、嗣因日人無意經營、遂於九年前、由榮宗敬氏以一百八十萬兩盤下、旋以内部機器及紗錠陳舊、幾度改良、迄今耗費已達百餘萬元之譜、當昔年楊樹浦路地位尚屬荒僻、地價頗低、其間一度有人向榮氏商榷、擬以六萬元一畝、售予改做他業、尚未得榮氏允許、由此可知該廠僅地價一項、約值在三百萬元以上、今日以國幣二百二十五萬元脱售、實屬便宜之至、</p>
<p>制止無效　華東社云、特區第一法院當局、以該項産權、已由該院執行假扣押在案、照例該洋行無權拍賣、故於昨日曾派員前往制止、但魯意師摩洋行方面、以該項營業、係屬匯豐銀行所委託、故是否拍賣、須由匯豐决定、但匯豐方面、則對於法院制止、悍然不顧、仍命該洋行代為拍賣、於是昨日下午三時半、竟仍如期拍賣也、</p>
<p>拍賣情形　中央社云、昨日下午三時、北京路魯意師摩拍賣行中、中外男女人士、擁擠一室、蓋最低價值達二百五十萬之空前拍賣、即將舉行也、三時半、該行拍賣人某西人、即登台宣讀申新抵押與匯豐之契約、達半小時之久、四時正、該員即呌岀最低價值二百二十五萬元、時人叢中即有二日本人、應聲願以二百二十五萬元承購、待該員再欲益價拍賣時、竟無應者、乃擊錘拍定、該二日本人為村上及岡本二律師、中央社記者叩以代表何家承購、竟堅不宣佈、後經中央社記者調查、據謂確係日商豐田紗廠代表、隨即偕同該行人員、入辦公室、繳付證金一萬元、</p>
<p>買主傳説　據華東社記者調查所得、此次投票得主、係日商大連汽船會社、由豐田紡織廠株式會社岀面購得、表面係改由日人接辦、實際上該大連汽船會社擬改為碼頭之用、蓋大連汽船會社楊樹浦路三四○號黄浦碼頭、係毘連於楊樹浦路四六八號申新七廠、申新廠在東、該公司碼頭在西、該公司素有覬覦之心、今則始遂其願云、又據確悉、該公司將申新七廠於最近期内、暫由豐田紗廠株式會社經營紡織、不久即將拆缷、而翻建為碼頭之用、折合該項六十八畝地産、每畝祗值三萬餘、所有生財機件、均不費分文云、</p>
<p>國人憤慨　中央社云、當時在塲國人、多已知申新七廠、已於昨日上午、由該廠第二債權人中國上海兩銀行、向法院聲請假扣押、此項拍賣、在法律上已失其根據將來必有交涉、然對此鉅價實業、竟為外人拍賣塲中宣告拍賣、而又為日人以廉價購去、莫不表示憤懣、</p>
<p>法院表示　中央社記者、隨即往第一特區法院訪晤郭院長、適郭公岀、由書記官長代見、據謂、該廠第二債權人中國上海兩銀行、既已聲請假扣押在案、此後自當依據法律辦理云云、</p>
<p>紗業意見　又據紗廠聯合會負責人謂、申新七廠、被匯豐拍賣、實為憾事、我國紗廠因受社會不景氣影響及日紗傾銷、久瀕絶境、廠商雖艱苦奮鬥、缺少後盾、雖銀行界方面有意援助、奈心餘力絀何、目下雖已拍賣、但仍當據理力争、以免鉅大實業、落於他國人之手、又謂汪院長頃有電來、或已不及於三時半前向匯豐交涉矣、</p>
<p>汪院長電　（上略）有電並誦悉、本日院議已議决、先由上海吴市長勸諭匯豐銀行、暫緩拍賣、並由財政實業兩部、會商救濟辦法、業已分别電令矣、特覆、</p>
<p>榮氏談話　中央社記者、於下午五時、晤該公司總經理榮宗敬氏、由過守一律師代表談話、對匯豐拍賣七廠、表示反對、中國上海二銀行曾允墊欵拔還債欵達一百萬元、仍為匯豐所拒絶、又謂本公司所屬各廠、日納統税在二萬元以上、第二廠第五廠停工後、國家税收每日减少六千元、即每月减少十八萬元、如我國紡織業無法維持、則影響國家尤鉅、前曾蒙財政當局允將本公司統税、暫行記賬、但深鍳國家財政支絀、仍未欠分文、總之徵收統税之財政當局、對垂斃之中國紡織應予救濟、而免崩潰、實責無旁貸云云、至此後交涉、當以第二債權人為中心云、</p>
<p>總工會電　本市總工會昨分電中央各部文云、南京實業部陳部長外交部汪兼部長司法行政部王部長鈞鍳、案據申新第七廠全體工友呈稱、該廠係實業家榮宗敬氏所創設、全部財産、價值五百萬元以上、年來因紗業衰落、經濟週轉不靈、故曾將全部財産、向英商匯豐銀行抵押借欵二百萬元、兹以到期無力償還、願付全部息金、並籌還一部份押欵本金、迭經與該行洽商、未蒙允許、經該行突然公告於本月二十六日委托魯意斯摩將全部財産拍賣、事關中國整個實業及全體工人生計、請予援助等情、據此、查匯豐銀行憑藉其經濟力量、擅自處分申新七廠財産、顯係有意摧殘我國實業、為此電請鈞部、迅賜有效制止、予以救濟以保産權而維實業、無任廹切之至、上海市總工會叩</p>

<h3>自上海駕汽車可直往歐洲游覧</h3>
<p>瑞典探險家斯文赫定博士之言論</p>
<p>數千年前歐亞交通綫有恢復可能</p>
<p>瑞典探險家斯文赫定博士、前年應鐵道部聘、偕同專家技師等、赴西北察勘綏新公路、往返計歷十八個月、返京後、迭晤林主席汪院長等、旋赴漢謁見蔣委員長、日前返京、當晚偕助手諾齡博士乘車來滬、昨晨七時十五分抵此、下午接見中外新聞記者、報告此行經過、兹分誌於次、</p>
<p>昨晨到滬　赫定博士偕其助手諾齡博士、於昨晨七時十五分、由京乘車抵北站、前往車站歡迎者、計有瑞典駐華、代辦林規司脱、及瑞典總會主席諾曼·等多人、博士下車後、逕赴開納路一號瑞總領官邸休息、預定在滬謁晤鐵道部長顧孟餘、勾留三數日、即返平、取道西比利亞鐵路返歐、</p>
<p>暢述經過　昨日下午二時半、哈定博士在寓延納中西各報社記者、暢述此行經過、滔滔達二小時之久、沿途倍嘗艱苦、以地質學家·考古學家·眼光、加以繪述、殊感興趣、博士首謂、余於一九三三年八月二十三日應中國鐵道部聘來華、察勘緩新公路、同行計有鐵部技師三人、瑞典醫師霍門·瑞典考古家潘蒙教授·等、及汽車四輛、一九三三年十月二十五日由北平岀發、首至歸化、然後經由内蒙古沙漠、輾轉於去年二月六日達新疆之哈密、全程計長二千基羅米突、全綫實為一最合宜之汽車公路、</p>
<p>新疆富源　博士繼謂新疆一省之面積、幾與全歐洲相等、計有五百萬平方英里面積、而人口則僅有三百五十萬人、其地百分之九十為沙漠、為全世界離海岸綫最遠之大陸、而其富源、至足驚人、有極豐富之金銀等各礦、哈密之西、有極大油池、余於四十五年前、曾一度探險至彼、發見與喜馬拉耶山並行之山脈、及漢代之羅蘭古城、蓋數千年前歐亞交通、胥由此廣大沙漠、經新疆而至西安也、唐時中國絲即由此徑運往羅馬、</p>
<p>亂事阻塞　余等抵哈密後、乃更西進、至吐魯番、適逢新疆亂事、戰禍爆發、倍嘗艱率、終由托克遜·庫爾拉·庫車·而達蘇聯交界之阿克蘇、余之汽車四輛、初被叛黨扣留、作為逃逸之利器、最後復為盛世才軍借為追擊之用、覊留數月、及亂事平、始由盛督辦派衛隊五十名護送岀境、四車亦絲毫無損、歸途由哈密·安西·敦煌·玉門·肅州·甘州·凉州·蘭州·而達陝西之西安、經由隴海路於本年二月十四日返抵南京、</p>
<p>歐亞交通　經此次察勘結果、綏新公路之計劃、即（一）可由歸化經内蒙古大路而至哈密、（二）由西安經蘭州·凉州·甘州·肅州·玉門·敦煌·安西·而至哈密、二綫均有原路可循、輕而易舉、由哈密經土魯番·庫爾拉·庫車·而達阿克蘇、界於中俄國境間、有一小段、倘經蘇俄政府允可、與蘇俄公路接通、即可直達歐洲、數千年前歐亞交通綫、預料不久之將來、有恢復實現之可能、換言之、苟由滬至歸化間汽車可通、則由上海駕汽車即可直往歐洲遊覧、至興築鐵路計劃、需欵巨、復需相當時間、非易言也云云、</p>
<h3>斯文赫定氏</h3>
<p>蘇俄勢力　博士最後謂、余岀發前、奉鐵部訓令、除察勘公路外、絶對不涉及政治問題、故在新疆任何方面人物、均為友人、至蘇俄在彼、亦無特殊勢力、僅貿易方面確日有進展、今次返京後、迭蒙林主席·汪院長·等盛禮欵待、異常感激云云、博士年已七十、鬆已斑白、而精神異常飽滿、講解近兩小時、尤無倦容、其勇往直前冒險精神、殊值得吾人欽佩也、</p>

<p>日電所傳　據林氏談、日電所傳本會派遣國際企業公司總經理金伯藩為持使、渡日考察中日提携之具體方案、藉以披瀝彼此之誠意、而作建立提携方案之資料、並傳金氏發表談話、謂中國一般商工界、在原則上、均極力歡迎日本商品云云、查日電所傳之金伯藩、在本會方面、並不有此特使派遣渡日、所謂國際企業公司經理係陳伯藩、而非金伯藩、陳氏本一華僑、常在神户或上海居住、</p>
<p>絶對否認　其人雖與予相識、但並非商聯會所派遣之特使、惟陳氏此次渡日前、私人方面、曾一度接洽、蓋日本方面所傳之中日經濟提携方案、吾國工商界頗欲知其内幕、而發表此項方案之日商務官横竹、予亦相識、故曾為陳氏介紹、囑其代為訪詢真相、至於陳氏在日發表之談話、謂吾國工商界極力歡迎日本商品一語、顯然日方藉此以作自身宣傳、蓋吾國工商實業、對於任何外貨、均不歡迎其進口也云、</p>

<h3>外商銀行提高利息增發鈔票各方觀察談</h3>
<p>中國社云、外商銀行、近為吸收我國現銀起見、在滬各外商銀行、近將在華發行大量鈔票、並提高利息、以吸收我國民間存銀、中國社記者、昨特趨訪本市銀行公會秘書林康侯氏及經濟專家李權時、探詢真相、兹將各情誌後、</p>
<p>林氏意見　先據林氏談、外商銀行在華發行鈔票、更為我國金融主權之一大損失、乃自中國交通兩銀行相繼成立後、國人對於本國鈔票、極為信用、良以發行鈔票之華商銀行、其十成凖備金、由政府監視保管、至於外商銀行在華發行鈔票、以袁世凱時代數額為最多、年來國人以國人之資金、而供外人作企業之投資、深覺其非、至於華商銀行、對於此事、希望政府善為處理云、</p>
<p>李氏談話　又據經濟專家李權時博士談、外商銀行、近欲大量發行鈔票、及增加利息、以吸收我國現銀、關於增發鈔票唯一有效辦法、凡外商銀行鈔票、無論其在民間或華商銀行、隨收隨即向外商銀行兑現、至於外商銀行增加利息、以圖吸收我國現銀、實因近來國人覺悟所致、最近外商銀行運銀岀國、庫存鋭减、存户紛紛提欵、在軍閥時代、一部份國人、甚至有自願不給利息而將欵存入外商銀行者、今則提高利息、顯然因存户激减、漸將没落之前奏曲云、</p>
<p>外商解説　新聲社云、外商銀行增發鈔票、提高利息案、各界均甚重視、新聲社記者昨向外商銀行界探悉、英商匯豐麥加利等銀行、於民國二十三年總結帳前、鍳於滬市銀根之奇緊、曾將以前逐漸收國鈔票、再行發行、俟總結帳後、因華商錢莊等因領發中國交通等銀行鈔票關係、故對於收進之外商銀行鈔票、翌日即行兑現、况國人歡迎用華商銀行鈔票、故今鍳於辦法之不妥、已逐漸收回、至於提高各存户利息、實因物價關係、去年存户年息、恒在一厘七毫半左右、今年起、匯豐麥加利等三銀行年息、已改為五厘、至於外傳上海市銀行業同業公會堅請制止案、據該會秘書長林康侯表示、並無此事、</p>

<h3>談噉飯之道</h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>歸隱和登仕既都是噉飯之道，那就儘可以不必扭扭怩怩，嬌聲怪氣。粗聲來一個「我也是為着噉飯的」！也不見得就怎樣辱没了自家，——雖然好像有傷風雅。一般雅士們可不高興這個，偏要裝腔作態，擠尖嗓子，掩住鼻孔，來一聲嬌嬌滴滴，這正是戲台上小丑們的慣技。即使小丑穿上了八卦衣，綸巾羽扇，掛上長鬚，也終還免不了鼻頭一點白，何况嗓子早也就有點異樣。——這在於他們是「隔膜」的。</p>
<p>「士」要風雅而表之於文章，可見還是張揚而已。要想來個把風雅之名，吸烟品茗，吟詩作文，間或抄抄明人尺牘，蛀蛀袁中郎，原是不可少的勾當。我不曾見過連肚子都給餓癟了還在「窗下學畫蛇」的逸士，可見風雅終歸是不但有得吃飯，而且還有得喝苦茶，抽抽烟，玩玩骨董或袁中郎全集者們的産物。這一類的「雅」自然是屬於所謂純粹派的。此外呢，也還大有以此為噉飯之道者在。「圓巾氣」之所以風極一時，為開鑼喝道者們所應和，也還是所謂「噉招牌手」而已。</p>
<p>噉飯，這在於「文人」們好像就是一條很不雅觀的「尾巴」，然事實上！這條「尾巴」早就註定應有的。既然如此，那麽大家都露岀「尾巴」談其文學，豈不坦白而更省事？可是，「人」是愛風雅的，尤其「文人」。誰都高興偷偷摸摸地把自己的「尾巴」翹起來，藏在長袍或燕尾服里，然後站在局外人的地位，笑人家：「嘻，一條尾巴！」</p>
<p>寫文章罵别人存心為着換錢而寫文章的卑汚齷齪，豈知他的寫文章不會是存心換稿費？寫雜文來痛罵雜文的「罪惡」，也不是同一「門路」。封神榜里紂王和妲已在夜里大宴衆狐女，雖然牠們會摇身一變，扮成嬌滴滴的美人兒，到了酒醉的時候，尾巴也還是禁不住要露岀來的。</p>
<p>這年頭，讀書界這塊骨頭已經够瘦，垂涎三尺的人們既然已不少，則「争」也一定就免不了。你來個小品期刋，我來個幽默雜誌，為了幾元編輯費，同門的也分了家，各樹一幟，互相詆誹，自標淸高，也是毫不足怪的。最後的尾巴，也還是為着噉飯，儘管這「尾巴」翹得多高，藏得多密，一到了「得意忘形」，或互相争奪的時候，總是禁不住要露岀來的。</p>
<p>文章換飯，這是不足為羞的，而且「以其所有，易其所無」，也正合乎交換的大道理。不過稍有「良心」者，不要像吃白相飯的，用欺騙的手段，奪取鄉下佬的僅少的金錢，只要「貨真價實」，雖然間或賺了多少，也就「於心無愧」了。</p>
<h3>筆與刀</h3>
<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>前人讀書，或牢騷滿腹，或忠義奮發的時候，往往就得意忘形長嘯高歌曰：「我有筆如刀。」</p>
<p>實則筆之於刀，究竟是截然不同的兩般傢私，而文人會拿它來相提並論，是與「三國志」所記劉先主的「髀肉復生」的話，有同等感慨，同類牢騷。</p>
<p>文人，誰也知道天生成就是「手無縛鷄之力」的白臉書生，並無武將上陣衝鋒的那般威風和神勇。祗會摇筆桿子，不善舞刀，更不要説能够拿刀殺人，似乎也成了天經地義。然而，他竟於是敢拿筆來比刀了，其不甘示弱也可知。</p>
<p>文人説自己的筆可當刀，實在是一點也不算誇大了的。這就祗要看自古聖明天子開科取士，便是自古已然。因此，有武狀元，也就一定會有文狀元。而且從筆底下得來的，類多如探囊取物，毫不費力，用不着像武的那樣要拿性命去賭，喘氣如牛。是筆底的力量，不僅「如刀」，有時且是「勝過於刀」了。</p>
<p>從前的時候，文武界限紊嚴，但還有所謂儒將這人物。如要説白一點，所謂儒將，就是因為他在能武中帶了點文，纔凑成了風雅。因為能拿刀殺人，又會摇筆桿子，就不復是匹夫之勇了，人們纔看重了他，呌做文武雙全。於是做元帥招討也然綽有餘裕了。這就是畢竟不能不説靠了會使用這枝筆桿子的福。</p>
<p>武將使刀天字第一號能耐的却要算關夫子，然而他的絶技也祗止於拖刀計。到現在，就縱不失傳，也抵不過飛機大礮，萬人敵也就變做了徒然。而文人的筆底的伎倆，却没落伍，倒有驚人的進步了。</p>
<p>文人利用着這枝筆可做進身之階，固不用去説了；重要的還是當成了武器，他可以利用着它來顛倒是非，造謡撞騙。雖是那麽一枝筆，然而在文人手裏，却已變做了明刀真槍，暗箭流矢，烟幕彈，這些現代殺人利器了。</p>
<p>就拿戰術來説：武人自古就是角力取勝，文人用的却是機智，到現在仍然還是機智。他對敵人可以不從正面打，乖巧的曉得傍敲側擊，使你防不勝防。真是筆掃千軍，無敵不摧，無戰不克了。</p>
<p>「有筆如刀」的説法，單看，雖祗是成為文人不遇的牢騷，但過去却是大偏於正面作想了；以為那筆鋒大勢，似乎專門為了斬奸除邪，如今纔曉得是大謬不然！</p>
<p>筆果「如刀」，且可「勝刀」，是一些兒也没錯。因此在現代，這枝「如刀」或是「勝刀」之筆握在了文人手裏，是可以够人寒心的。此外像那些國際流行的有所謂「維持什麽和平」之類的這文章做岀來，那祗是高鼻子之類的偉大文人，抄襲了中國的王道，筆法自又不同！筆到了那些物質文明的文人手裏，也就更進步科學化了：那筆就不止是「如刀」，「勝刀」，竟然是毒瓦斯了。</p>
<h3>文學上的憧憬</h3>
<p>— 白萊</p>
<p>「世紀末」悲哀病患者是没有「明天」的哲學的，他們近視，只看見「身邊」，只看見「眼前」。如果表現在文學的製作上，那是一首没有憧憬的白描。然而這樣的作品，即使有着很優秀的技術，其不被每個現實主義的讀者給以較高的評價乃是當然的事。在我們中國，「勸君莫惜金縷衣，勸君惜取少年時；有花堪折直須折，莫待無花空折枝」。那真是一首没有憧憬的詩的好例子。再説，「茵夢湖」的作者施德繆也曾經這樣地唱過：</p>
<p>「今天只有今天，你還是那麽窈窕；明朝呀明朝，萬事都要休了——只這一刻兒你是我的所有。死時候呀死時候，我只合獨葬荒兵」！</p>
<p>然而，作為有正義感的作者，他對「光明」是有所渴慕；對「黎明」是有所期待的。甚至為了這「未來」的憧憬，他不惜忍受着那些不是「人」所應忍受的悲痛，磨難。自然，我們决不認為凡有憧憬的製作都是正義感的。陶淵明的「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山」。那只是描岀了作者底「遁世哲學」的意向。可是我們在高爾基的「鷹之歌」上，該怎樣替自己欣幸着，能體會到這一首卓絶的對「明日」的憧憬的歌。並且，這兩者無疑地是一對極端的對照。而後者，將因那積極的奮鬥哲學而被賦與不朽的生命，也該是依據歷史發則必然的結果。</p>
<p>文學，已然臨到淸算的時候了。一切的作品，被否定抑被保存；在這一意義上，該不致交白卷。</p>
<h3>歷史小品脞談（六）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>其次要説到敷衍法，論語孔子去齊章，寫孔子狼狽情形，的確是小品題材。我前面提到過的那個唱本，他敷衍全文，道：</p>
<p>「他師徒……一路上觀不盡的瀟湘景，猝然間遇着個瘋子到車前。他那裏一邊走着一邊唱，唱的是雙鳯齊鳴天下傳。他説道：「虞舜已没文王死，漢陽郡那有韶樂共岐山！你從前棲遑道路且莫論，至而今羽翼困倦也該知還。你看這郢中那有梧桐樹，何不去尋個高岡把身安？你只想高呌一聲天下曉，全不念那屈死的龍逢和比干！」他那裏口裏唱佯長去，到把個孔子聽的心痛酸。……老夫子走向前來待開口，他趕着趕起腿來一溜烟。弄的没滋搭味把車上，猛抬頭波浪滚滚在面前。師徒們勒馬停騎過不去，看了看兩個農夫在鄉裏耕田。吩咐聲「仲由你去問一問，你問那裏水淺好渡船？」仲夫子聞聲此言不怠慢，邁開大步到近前。他説道：「我問老哥一條路，告訴俺那是道口那是灣？」長沮説：「車上坐的那一位？」子路説：「孔老夫子天下傳。」長沮説：「莫不是家住衮州府？」子路回答「然然然」！長沮説：「他走遍天下十三省，教的那些門徒都是聖賢。」説罷竟將黄牛趕，你看他達達𡂏𡂏緊加鞭。閃的個好勇子路瞪着眼，無奈何又向桀溺問一番。桀溺説：「看你不像本地客，你把那家鄉姓氏對我言？」子路説：「家住泗水本姓仲。」桀溺説：「你是聖人門徒好打拳。」子路説：「你既知名可為知己，你何不快把道口指點咱？」桀溺説：「夜短天長你發什麽躁！慢慢的聽我從頭向你言：你不見滄海變田田變海，你不見碧天連水水連天！你縱有摘星換月好手段，也不能翻過天來倒個乾！與其你跟着游學到處創，你何不棄文去武學種田？白日裏家中吃碗現成飯，强於你在陳餓的眼珠藍。夜晚關門睡些安穩覺，强於你在匡嚇的心膽寒。這都是金石良言將你勸，從不從由你自便與我何干。」説着回頭把田種，二農夫一個後來一個先。仲夫子從來未佔過没體面，被兩個耕地農夫氣乍了肝。「若照我昔年那個猛浪性，定要踢頓脚來打頓拳。惱一惱提起他腿往河裏撩，定教那魚鼈蝦蟹得頓飽餐！」</p>
<h3>結算（上）</h3>
<p>— 夏時</p>
<p>北風呼呼地吼着，黑暗直向大地壓下來，一切便在黑暗中發抖。</p>
<p>「媽的？多冷吓！」禮生抱着一個篾火爐，無聊賴地罵着天。屋内是墨黑的。從另一角落内，起了一聲女人的回響。</p>
<p>「你不去眼四老爺算一算嗎？」這是他女人。</p>
<p>禮生没有做聲。四面破壁，在嗶剥地交響着。他想：</p>
<p>「算什麽鬼！一年不如一年，又不是白白做了一年别人的兒子！」</p>
<p>雖然這樣，他的拖鞋聲，仍在别達剔達向門外移去。</p>
<p>岀了門，更冷得緊。風從領口，袖口，褲脚口，一陣陣向身上刺，直刺透了心。他打了一個冷戰，忙把圍巾向頸上圍，兩手從袖口縮了進去，提起火爐緊貼着身。</p>
<p>眼前全是黑暗。巷是彎曲的，左轉，右轉，一不慎，頭便碰在牆上，他雖然走熟了，仍只好慢慢移。</p>
<p>巷内牛屎很多；這不能怪誰，只好自己當心。眼睛特别向地下注視：注視着，枉然，是黑暗，脚底下一滑，屎臭衝進鼻，鞋子上，也許襪子上，褲脚上滿沾了屎。「媽的」！有什麽法，自己罵自己。</p>
<p>他没有吃晚飯。不吃飯，早睡，到了冬天一向是如此的。今天，睡不成，算他媽的鬼賬要緊；肚裏有點荒，於是，他想：</p>
<p>「到汗老板那裏去喝一杯酒吧。」</p>
<p>走過汗老板的舖門，是祠堂，汗老板租來當做舖，從門縫内看到有燈光，人在談話。禮生一脚把門踢開。</p>
<p>木匠老二在喝酒。汗老板坐在横頭，嘴裏的旱烟管，忽然地直伸到凳脚下。</p>
<p>「吃酒！」老二打招呼。</p>
<p>「坐！」汗老板冷然地點一點頭。</p>
<p>「好冷！」禮生一面也點點頭，一面伸起脚向光處照。隨後，脚放地下踏，踏，鞋底輕鬆了，牛屎粘在地上。於是，他坐下，面對老二。開口是：</p>
<p>「媽的！弄了一脚的屎！」接着是：</p>
<p>「老二！幾時回來的？」附帶是：</p>
<p>「半斤扎酒，四兩花生。」聲音漸漸低。</p>
<p>汗老板懶懶地，身子似乎抬不起，加重問：「半斤麽？」</p>
<p>禮生没有回答，他和老二在交談，老板哼哼氣，只有咬着烟管向櫃内走。</p>
<p>「今年生意好罷。」禮生問。</p>
<p>「混飯而已。還不如你們在鄉下種田好。」老二嘆息着。</p>
<p>「種田好？我們連飯也混不到呢。」禮生憤憤然。</p>
<p>「也無怪！這幾年年歳太不好。年歳不好，做手藝不是一樣受苦嗎？做的東西，賣不到錢，有什麽辦法？」老二説。</p>
<p>「你們總比種田好！像我，全是租的别人的田地，就是年歳好……唉！現在有錢的人多惡啊。」禮生亂摇着頭，似不勝痛苦。</p>
<p>老二不再説，在禮生面前斟上半碗酒，接上是：</p>
<p>「吃杯酒吧！明天怕要下雪呢？」</p>
<p>「不客氣！」禮生一面讓，眼睛移向櫃檯裏的汗老板。</p>
<p>汗老板正在打酒，秤花生，仍是懶懶地。口内回答老二的話：</p>
<p>「冬天要下雪，下了雪明年才有好年歳咧。」</p>
<p>縱是慢，扎酒花生終於上了桌。禮生提起壺，要敬老二，老二不肯；他便滿斟在自己面前的酒碗内。汗老板仍打横，跟着剥花生。</p>
<p>「今年還好罷？」老板問。</p>
<p>「唔……」禮生不做聲，酒向喉内滚。</p>
<p>「你欠我的那點數目，今年……」是老板的話。</p>
<p>「唔……」又是一口一口的酒。</p>
<p>「共一千二百，還有些是去年欠的。」老板拿開早烟管，嘴内放岀一大泡烟。</p>
<p>「唔……」又是一口。酒乾了，禮生站起來。「多少？等一回還你的，離過年還有三天呢。」接着，向老二：</p>
<p>「你再坐！媽的！我還要到四老爺家裏去結賬咧。」</p>
<p>汗老板拿起算盤，數數酒兩百，花生六十，加上舊欠，總共一千四百六十。他放下算盤，沈重喊着：</p>
<p>「一千四百六。」</p>
<p>禮生不做聲，提起篾火爐，走，老板的聲音，直向他後面追。</p>
<p>「今年不還是不行的啊！大家和你一樣，我的生意做得成嗎？」</p>
<p>禮生很生氣；但無法，自己没有錢，只好背地岀口氣，罵一句：</p>
<p>「這老傢伙真麻煩！」</p>
<p>轉彎便是四老爺的屋。禮生心内撲撲跳，有些慌，停着在門口。過一會，才推門進去。</p>
<h3>嚮晚（八）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>正在加緊工作的大肚子，連咽那些個烟氣，都在恨自己喉頭少長了幾個似的，怎麽也没空閒兒來回答這話；直等到烟頭燒到最後底一點，再也抽不上烟來了，於是也照樣坐起，閉着嘴，不讓烟氣透一絲風；連忙提過茶壺來呵了口茶，連茶帶烟地吞下了肚去，然後才透過氣，跳下床來，拍着手呌。「真對呀！真對呀！祗有像你那樣才可以註唐詩哪！」</p>
<p>大肚子底拖鞋聲在坑床間鐵答鐵答地響。門外却送來一陣篤篤的皮鞋聲。</p>
<p>「是誰呀！」胡一元淡然地問。聲音頗顯得老到而帶些輕慢。</p>
<p>「是我。——我們。」昂然的回答：</p>
<p>「郭仁和李安呀！」尖脆而淸朗。——帶有從凡華琳弦上顫岀來的情調。</p>
<p>「哦！」胡一元立刻從坑床上跳下，走岀了穴洞門，大肚子跟在後邊。</p>
<p>一個高高的幾乎頂住天花板的瘦影，和一個矮矮的肩頭跟室内紅木方桌相平的胖子，岀現這十三號房間内了。</p>
<p>「哦！」鵝蛋形臉盤兒仰了起來，胡一元搶上一步，用着長過手指的短褂的手袖，行了個鞠躬如也的揖。「難得！難得！我那條子接到了嗎？」</p>
<p>「自然咯！」高瘦子低下頭來，瞧着胡一元，同時，拚命抽吸着鼻子。「唔！香呢！」</p>
<p>「香呀。」矮半子仰着頭，從天花板，屋角溜眼。像要尋岀這房間裏秘密來的。</p>
<p>「可是有些什麽事呀！」高的又問上一句。</p>
<p>更正：昨日「不是寓言」一文中第十二行「架事實……」架字下落去一空字；第十四行「惟其中亦有莫」句，莫乃真之誤；第四十一行「所以這一團搆成的……」，「一團」下落去一糟字；第四十六行「普遍惟」乃「普遍性」之誤；第六十九行「雖已認為…」一句，雖字乃確字之誤；第七十二行「也許是蒼蠅的蒼蠅的聲音了」句，「蒼蠅的蒼蠅的聲音」，乃「蒼蠅的嗡嗡的聲音」之誤。第七十八行「都可不必」句，都乃却之誤。</p>

<h3>閩省女籃球錦標隊厦門羣惠昨勝全菲隊</h3>

<p>（馬尼拉二十六日電）厦門羣惠女子籃球隊為福建全省女子籃球錦標隊、此次與兩江女籃球隊、同時到達菲埠、頗受華僑熱烈歡迎、其實力之强、堪與兩江相稱、在菲曾以四十對八勝全岷明星隊、僅以一分之差敗於兩江、該隊昨與菲人組織之全菲隊比賽、結果二十一對九羣惠獲勝云、</p>

<h3>教育部令發贑職教改進點</h3>
<p>教部頃將督學顧兆麐前次視察贑省職業教育之報告中、江西省職業學校應行改進各點、令行贑教育廳遵照、</p>
<p>查江西省職業學校、除農業一項、由省立農業院試騐各項農産、統一推行外、其屬於工商各科者、設備則逐年增加、校務則日見進境、各校新設科目頗多可觀、概由教育廳統籌全局、按照預定計劃辦理、推行亦殊盡力、其私立職校、雖處所無多、設置簡易、但其堅苦卓越絶之精神、亦有可取、兹將應行改進各點分列如左、</p>
<p>（一）江西省立各職業學校、其工商等科設備既有增加、指導學生實習亦頗注意、新設之職業科辦理尤為岀色、教育廳所擬改進職校計劃、亦屬切實允當、惟以前沿襲設立之科目、仍有不切地方情形之處、嗣後應隨時依照原案推行、以期全部改進、</p>
<p>（二）各職校所設科目以應用化學為最難辦理、職業設備既不充足、製造品類又復廣泛、且於地方需要、亦不相應、學生就業毫無把握、嗣後應以改設其他適宜科目為原則、倘處理困難、應令縮小範圍、專精一種或數種製造、各校就所研究項目分别酌增設備、以免重複、染織一科、亦有同樣情形、須分門研究組織圖案自製新品、勿徒抄襲滬廠成式、以求改進、凡此改革均須由各該校擬具辦法、呈廳統籌核奪、</p>
<p>（三）省立職校之屬於八商業範圍者、其實習工廠及商店大抵均缺乏流動資本、可就其確有把握之事業、由教育廳恊助實施、向銀行貸欵辨法、以期增進生産效能、及省會學校林立、學生制服及其他用品、所耗甚多、若於職校工商科可能範圍内舉辦合作社、則現有之染織·縫紉·商業等科、均可推廣學生實習機會、並增加工作效力、於將來就業亦多裨助、</p>
<p>（四）省立一職印刷科實習、成績甚優、學生踴躍工作經營尚屬得法、染織科學生實習、興趣亦濃、成品亦有可觀、該校新設科目、尚合於地方生産之需、而原有科目如應化等成績較差、應設法改進、</p>
<p>（五）省立二職商科、集股經辦銀行、已著成績、各界存欵達十餘萬之多、並取得代理各校金庫之地位、學生實習、既因以獲得實際經騐、就業亦不致發生問題、可謂得其要領、殊堪嘉許、該校現正試辦農村貸欵事業、據云、前途已有希望、自應繼續推行、惟贑省岀産甚富、關於商業方面之運輸·倉庫·保險等業務、亦須酌量籌辦、務使志願在城市或農村服務者各有經營練習之機會、方不致有所偏倚、倘為該校力所能及、應於高級班、内設法分科、專精習練、較為切要、</p>
<p>（六）省立工專附設高級科職業部機械、設備雖有增加、仍嫌簡略、基礎尚未穩固、查江西全省機械工廠絶少、微第製造成件機器、有所不能、即配備修理零件亦所少見、證以地方需要情形、該校對於學生實習指導、應特别注意實用工作、其應化一科、醬油釀造、已可成為商品、製革亦有可觀、製胰機械業已安置、尚未開工、較之其他職校相同科目已有希望、應特别注意學生實習工作、以求精熟實用、</p>
<p>（七）省立女子職校藝術科縫紉一門、應仿照湖南通行之合作社辦法、由學校組設、並為規定承做價格、代為經理（其價格收入、可提成奬給學生）務期以社會材料供學生實習、同時並可養成學生對於生産及職業之正當觀念、如辦理得法、各校學生制服、均可承做、至應用化學一科、則因設備太簡、無法實習、應另籌改造辦法、該校校址狹小、工廠又經政府收回、致染織科已購機件、因無地可容、不能安置、殊為可惜、是否於城郊撥給校基將原有校舍地皮岀售相當價格、從新建築新校舍之處、應由廳詳加計劃實施、</p>
<p>（八）省立九江陶瓷科職業學校、正在遷校佈置、尚未就緒、未能視察、按江西瓷業、品質甚佳、自有其名貴珍重之價值、但不易製成通常粗厚堅實之器、而與舶來品之陶器相競争、經與該校校長張浩討論、嗣後應宜注意於明淸兩代仿古瓷器之製法及花紋顔色之保存與改善、並着手於各項譜式之搜集、將固有瓷器之精美要點、保持而發揮、當較之仿造舶來品為有實益、此外於手工製瓷之中、應注意簡單機械工具之利用與創製、勿令安於從來之熟練手工技術而不思設法改進、是為至要、</p>
<p>（九）私立劍聲中學職業部、學行實習工作精神、最為奮發、技術純熟、堪稱冠冕、惟以少數經費設立多科、究嫌未能兼顧、雖其職業備設多取簡單易置者、以便熟練學生之技能、但設備過於闕略、較為繁複之工作即不能實習、遑云創作、應一面以簡單設備熟練學生技能、一面增加各項職業機件用具、以引起其研究試騐之興趣、而於不違反該校之勤勞精神範圍内、為學生研究未知識技能增進機會、</p>
<p>（十）私立贑省中學附設之職業科、于動植物標本、製造已有相當成績、其簡單理化儀器、亦能獨岀心裁、利用廢物、殊多可取、綜觀該科辦理情形、自以生物標本模型為較有把握、即專攻此類製造亦無不可、惟僅賴簡單工具、效用殊少、應就校内餘屋改設工廠一處、并增各項用器、務　　備較為充實、合乎善事利器之義、方不致徒恃兩手流入空疏、至擬設之製造所、自屬規模較大、但于地方需要及經營方法須調查明確、乃可施行無阻、</p>
<p>（十一）省立女子職業補習學校、刺繡·縫紉等科略伍湘省職校辦理方法、尚能顧及事實、惜學生來學、目的不一致、職業訓練有時易生故障、應設法僑正、其年長失學而無意職業者、或併為一班、或酌增班級、施以普通補習教育、則對于志願職業者、目的單純、訓練施教自必較易、</p>
<p>（十二）省立蓮塘鄉村師範、校址環境甚佳、辦理頗見成效、勞作科實施尤有方法、惜土質太劣、關于實習及試騐事項、均感異常困難、對于農業方面希望無多、可就原有勞作科基礎設法成立木工鐵工兩廠、利用簡單機械工具、製造工具·農具·校具及簡易標本儀器等實用品、該校位于田野間、能于各項教育竭力提倡、學生服務機會亦能設法增加、于鄉村教官之推行當有裨助、</p>

<p>大概菲律濱美術、過去受西班牙陶溶、故其建築雕刻、皆含古代羅馬遺風、至三十年來、始變近新大陸習尚、中菲雖祗隔一衣帶水、其種種關係、有悠久之歷史、然使菲律濱人在公開塲中、認識中國原有美術價值、並其特徵、此固為第一次、而且亦可使終日在椰影檳風環境中僑胞、認識祖國固有美術、現際亦時在推進中、且獨另具一種風格也、</p>

<h3>陳友生赴印講學畢談印度最近情形</h3>
<p>印度為佛教發源地而無佛教意味</p>
<p>革命領袖甘地現致力於社會運動</p>
<p>本埠立達學園教員陳友生君、於前年冬應印度國際大學之聘、前往講學、歷時一載、始於日前返滬、據談印度最近情形如次、</p>
<p>絶無佛教意味　印度現人口三萬萬五千萬、為佛教之發源地、我國自東漢以後、佛教目印東漸、但現時印度本地、既無和尚尼姑、即佛教始祖釋迦牟尼之故里、亦絶無佛教意味、或謂印度之亡、與佛教有關係、其實不然、印度之所以亡國、全在内部複雜、人民思想不統一、人民有如一盤散沙、較我國為尤甚、</p>
<p>階級制度甚烈　印度階級制度甚烈、分而又分、洗衣有洗衣階級、剪髮有剪髮階級、多至數千種、全印商業、操縱在英人之手、實握有政治經濟之重心、印度現尚有一百二十餘小國、各有國王、英人利用若輩、自相殘殺、故印度並不為英國所亡、乃自送於英國者、語云、國必自伐而後人伐之、真是確論、</p>
<p>甘地最近狀况　印度革命領袖甘地、於一九二○年突然宣布非武力主義、至今有十餘年之努力、現英人對付印人甚為殘酷、各機關長官都係英人、故印度革命勢力全被英人監視、致甘地毫無辦法、現甘地已辭去國民大會主席之職、專致力於社會運動、打破階級制度、中國目前環境雖惡劣、然尚能自由做去、以視印度亡國之過程、作為自强自救之參考、而整頓内部、方有挽回之辦法云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>馬爾騰博士有一句鼓勵青年的名言，他説：「創造的歷程，實是鍜練意志的東西。」的確，如果我們每天能够抽岀一點時間，略為靜心地思索一下，然後將理想所集中的思緒，慢慢地在口頭，或筆端表現岀來：我以為這種習性很易增進思索力的。</p>
<p>普通我們總是趁高興時，幹我們的工作，其實這不是經濟的辦法。我們最好每天有固定的時間，使意志自自由由地發展着，否則，時常要等候機會而弄到失時和没趣哩。</p>
<h3>紙吹</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>燒茶煮飯，吸水菸用紙吹引火是少不來的。没有火柴而用打火石取火的時候，打火必須用紙吹，所以人家的竈間裏總有一隻打火石器具；裏邊放着火石，打火力，插滅火的紙吹筒。就是廳堂或者書房裏的牆壁上，在字畫對條間總有這末一隻插滿了紙吹的紙吹筒點綴着。現在鄉村裏用的玻璃瓶製成的煤油燈，也是用這紙吹做燈心。</p>
<p>小時候每天有兩件刻板工作要給爸爸做，早上洗便壺，晚上捲紙吹。晚飯後，温過日間讀的書，然後捲紙吹，媽媽坐在檯左邊縫衣服，爸爸坐在對面　咯　咯地吸水菸，可是我的手在捲，眼却合攏了，腦袋上給爸爸打一下，醒了仍是捲，因為非捲好五十根就不能睡。</p>
<p>在我岀門學生意的前幾夜，爸爸同我説；「你要岀門了，給我多捲些吧，以後紙吹只好我自己捲了。」幾個晚上捲了幾綑掛在釘上給爸爸以後用，可是自從岀門後到爸爸死就没有捲過一根給爸爸用的紙吹了。</p>
<p>進了店，早上仍是給師長洗便壺，晚上又是捲紙吹，可是捲的却兩樣了，家裏捲的是毛邊的粗槁紙，店裏捲的紙質細而切成了斜角形的，捲時須襯一根竹扦子在裏邊，承師兄的指導，自己削了根竹扦子，每晚要捲完一刀紙才可睡。</p>
<p>紙吹每晚捲，捲到了足足三個年頭我滿師了，就讓給新來的師弟去捲了。</p>
<p>今天偶然間，會在箱底裏發現了我那根捲了三個年頭變了紅色的竹扦子，不禁使我回想到從這根竹扦子捲，家裏的爸爸在世時就没有份用他自己的兒子捲的紙吹用了。</p>
<h3>呌魂</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>中國人是一個特殊的民族，因此幹岀來的事都是特殊的。别的不説，單以去年的『婦女國貨年』來説吧，雖然戴上了那麽一頂堂皇的高帽子；但是，以一年過去的成績裏，我們便可以知道中國人的特殊情形了；尤其專門帶上了這種假面具來欺騙人家。然而得到的輿論怎樣呢？不用説，除了都給以他們攻擊外，别的也無庸談起。我們中國人所以會特殊，何嘗不是為了歎乎『婦女國貨年』等等的事實。</p>
<p>迷信之在中國，更是司空見慣的事了，這差不多又是所謂『特殊』吧？把泥塑木彫的東西，供在那掛着紅綢的幕裏，像祖宗一般的向它叩頭，祈禱。『呌魂』，便是中國人的迷信之一，在家庭裏的小孩偶然吃了一驚，有的便呆了一陣，有的甚至神經上受了較大的刺激而睡到了，這完全是一種極普通的事。然而在我們中國人的心目中，却以為是把靈魂嚇掉了，於是才有這『呌魂』的演岀：在午後，把紙綴成的所謂『元寶』，燒了一只，嘴裏便喊了一聲：『××回來吧！』這樣繼續地呌下去，燒下去。説是到了明天那病人便會復原了。</p>
<p>這是上海人一方的表演，還有阿拉甯波人的方法，把仙鶴紙糊住了茶杯口，用另外的一杯冷水一滴滴地滴在仙鶴紙上，嘴裏也喊着：『××回來吧！』等候仙鶴紙現岀了一顆白色的東西的時候，那便是病人的靈魂喊來了。試想，以一張薄得不能再簿的仙鶴紙，受着水的壓廹，當然的，會受到一種影響的。然而我們特殊的中國人會想岀這樣特殊的事情來，也怪不得人家冠我們以『特殊民族』的外號了。</p>
<h3>生存競争中包　　人力車夫</h3>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>走進房來首先有一件事，不能不讓張介夫詫異起來的，便是在桌上放了兩疊雪白光亮的銀元。雖然不知道有多少錢，可是由那堆頭上看來，約莫也就有二三十元。剛才是由這屋子裏岀去的，並不看到這桌上有錢，現在突然的放了兩疊大洋錢在桌上，必是一兩分鐘以前，他放在這裏無疑。當他這樣的向了那洋錢看着時，同時也就引起了胡氏母女兩個人注意，胡氏還想着，為什麽在桌上放下這兩注洋錢，莫非是這賈老爺預備賞人的嗎？賈多才眼見是大家注意這筆錢的了，他這才從從容容的，把那兩注洋錢放到桌子犄角邊去，將一紙來蓋上。張介夫心裏，也就有些明白了，故意凑趣道：我們賈大哥，真是錢多，整大疊的大洋，會放在桌子上。賈多才笑道：這也很有限的幾個錢，算得了什麽呢？不瞞你説，我手裏經過的錢，若是都換了現洋，恐怕把小西天前後上下這些屋子來堆，依然是堆不下吧？張介夫點着頭道：這倒不是假話，因為賈兄是做這行買的呢。説了這幾句不相干的話，賈多才纔騰岀那張嘴來，向胡氏打招呼道：請坐下罷，請坐下罷，有話慢慢的説。胡氏是不曾走進過這樣的屋子的。他走進來之後，除和那天月英雄來一般，感到許多新奇而外，便是這屋子並不是樓，可是脚底下也踏着是樓板，這要是跪在上面做事，比跪在暖坑上那還要舒服的多呢。於是退了兩步，向屋角落裏一把矮寄子上坐去。（一四三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「這一次我們回去的路上，必須讓那火車儘量的行得快一些！」太后很焦躁地給我們説道：「無論經過什麽地方，决不停留，他們儘管到站上來接駕，我們只當不看見一樣，斷不能再為他們而躭擱了！」</p>
<p>聽伊這樣説來，可見伊自己也是十二萬分的急着要回去。伊在這裏住了幾天，大概心神上已覺得不很甯靜，像受了一些驚嚇一樣；這是我從伊的語氣上推測岀來的。也許並非如此，但當時聽伊説的人，可説是没有一個不像我這樣猜測着的。總之，奉天這些古宫中的景象，確然是太慘淡而陰森了，無論什麽人住在裏面，都會感覺到不安的。</p>
<p>好了！這兩天工夫終於是過去了！我們便在這一日的早上，啓程回京。當然，太后心上雖已急着要回去，無意再接受人家的迎送，但人家是不知道的，即使知道，也不能不照例的來做作一番。所以那天的車站上，依舊是擠滿了奉天的一班大小官員；他們都是誠心誠意的來給太后送行的。可是太后下了轎，却絶不停留，扶着我們的肩頭，怱怱逕望車上走去；彷彿後面已有什麽追兵殺來的樣子，惟恐逃得太慢。待到一上了車，伊更不暇細看車中的東西已否全備，就急着呌人去傳令開車了。廻想伊從北京到奉天來的時候，最初上得火車，伊是何等的從容暇逸，而現在竟是這樣的怱遽急廹，真是多麽可笑？不過其時我們也和伊懷着同樣的鬼胎，所以便不覺得可笑了，除非奉天的那些官員看破了我們這樣狼狠遁逃的情形，那就不免要暗暗發笑了。（二五四）</p>
<h3>計生日妙訣</h3>
<p>— 沈宇</p>
<p>法則，用紙片五張，各劃成十六個小方格。這是很簡單的，一張紙片上，劃了四根經緯綫，不是就形成十六個小方格嗎。然後每張都自左至右的這樣寫着：</p>
<p>第一張是：一，三，五，七，九，十一，十三，十五，十七，十九，二十一，二十三，二十五，二十七，二十九，三十一。第二張是：二，三，六，七，十，十一，十四，十五，十八，十九，二十二，二十三，二十六，二十七，三十，三十一。第三張是：四，五，六，七，十二，十三，十四，十五，二十，二十一，二十二，二十三，二十八，二十九，三十，三十一。第四張是：八，九，十，十一，十二，十三，十四，十五，二十四，二十五，二十六，二十七，二十八，二十九，三十，三十一。第五張是：從十六起順次寫至三十一為止</p>
<p>這樣寫好後，便可應用了。是的，只要你告訴我這五張紙片上那幾張是有你的生日的，我就可立刻回答你的生日是在那天！</p>
<p>其實，用法很簡單，只要你記住那説「有」的幾張紙片上的上左角的數目字，相加起來即得。譬如説：你是二十六生日的，（這是隨便舉岀的例子，餘仿此）那麽我們現在來檢討一下。第一張是「無」，第二張是「有」，第三張又「無」，第四第五張均「有」。這樣我們可以將有」的那三張的上左角的數目相加起來，於是變成二加八再加十六，這「和數」不是二十六嗎？</p>
<p>這種計生日的玩意兒，前曾在街頭岀售過的，我覺得很够玩味，故不憚煩瑣，錄之以投本刋。</p>

<p>以前的挹雲，總是坐在自己的書室裏，捧着一本書，消磨去他一天的光陰的，現在他真怕坐在書室裏，比了朋友們拉他到玄妙觀裏去坐茶館，還要害怕原因是為着他的家裏，現今是有一家姓俞的人家，遷來同居了這俞家只有老夫婦兩個人，都有着五六十歳年紀，却半個子女都没有，陪伴着他們遷來的，僅僅是一個醜婢，和一頭餓到快要死了的黑雄貓。</p>
<p>這俞家的客堂，和挹雲的那間書室，不過是一牆之隔，而這俞家女主人，又是一個非常可憎的老媪，他好像忘記了自己已是一個鬢髮蒼然的老媪了，每走過人家面前時，常是扭扭揑揑的，彷佛一朶含苞的鮮花一般，教人看了，真正可惱，最最可恨者，就是他一天到夜，總是在他的客堂裏大聲喧閙着，除着早起顛倒錯亂的，念過若干遍劣僧僞造的太陽經之類外，就是不住的和那個醜婢争吵，有時他還能够獨自一人，喃喃笑語，似乎是瘋的一樣，挹雲坐在隔牆那間書室裏，往往給他閙成一個頭昏眼花，因此挹雲現今是怕坐在他的書室裏了。他想這樣一個老媪，實在是人間一頭怪物，無怪他的丈夫常是不去理睬他，而親戚朋友，也始終不見有一個人上門來。</p>
<p>難得有一天下午，那老媪和他的婢子吵閙得疲乏極了。他纔算回到他客堂左邊的一個廂房中午睡去，（這裏就是老媪和黑雄貓公用的臥室。）可憐的挹雲，趁此稀有的機會，方得悄悄地溜進自己的書室中去翻看幾頁書。看不滿半時，挹雲驀然聽得那老媪的臥室中，發岀幾聲幽媚的微呻來，那真是正在十八妙齡少女們的一種春夢初醒的微呻。挹雲聽得了，有些吃驚，他不防備一個年近六十的老媪，還有這麽一套奇蹟。可知他家裏的醜婢，常常背地裏罵他老妖精，大概是不為無據罷。挹雲料到那老媪醒起後，勢必又在客堂裏喧閙咧，他便慌忙離開書室，浩然岀門，到護龍街一帶舊書攤上翻看舊書去。</p>
<p>偶然經過一個冷攤，他買得了一張淸代裝束的美女舊照片，背後註着吴門名花佩紅倩影幾個字。本來佩紅是蘇地四十年前的一個名伎啊，這張照片，又是拍得了不得的可愛。那影中人的一派豓麗的姿態，是會教人百看不厭的。（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市久跌昨現反動</p>
<p>連跌十八日之紗市、今則顯現反動回蘇之象、引起空頭獲利抵補、同時有一部分紗廠、因營業困難、迄今尚未恢復工作、生産數量大為减縮、故市塲賣風稍歛、而有投機界購進棉紗、賣岀標花、作套頭交易、所以紗市較棉市為昂、</p>
<p>金鷄回起一元外　標紗前市開盤、各月均呈呆滯不前之象、塲中買賣不多、市價未有甚大變化、但拍至二三盤、因棉花下落、紗市帶跌五·六·七角、收盤時回升二·三角、結果各月均跌四角、午後開盤市氣突然緊張、買者雲集、因明日交割停市、而已跌十八日、一般散户為免危險起見、因此抵補軋直過夜者較衆、同本月份漲勢頗鋭、為二元一角、遠月漲一元二·三·五·六角、查賣岀大孚一千三百五十元、均昶一千一百五十包、源大九百包、錦昌一千○五十包、泰興五百包、益昶四百包、大昶四百五十包、吉豐五百五十包、買進大豐一千三百五十包、穗隆八百五十包、合興九百五十包、同和八百包、通記五百五十包、賡豐一千二百五十包、仁豐七百包、長豐六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下</p>
<p>紗銷八百包弱　現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮買去統計七百九十五包、行情與上日相仿、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>標花似有回好之象</p>
<p>棉市大跌之後、漸現回升之狀、實以比上年年暮之價、已跌去三元四角、此種反動、亦在意中、而標金市價仍平疲、故大部分的空額尚未活動抵補、檯面尚未十分轉機、但源大及多數賣方、由空翻多矣、據市塲目光、料其有一元之回風也、</p>
<p>鄭標後市棉空　標花前市開盤、美棉微漲二磅音、印棉跌零五羅比、塲中形勢依然渙散、各月呈徘徊之狀、但多頭方面、均似驚弓之鳥、頭盤平平、拍至二三盤賣風尤熾、空方又來猛抛、各月發現新低峰、但至收盤時、有大户抵補、回漲一角半、結果各月均跌二角至二角半、午後開盤市氣忽然轉緊、買户蜂擁而來、空頭獲利、購買愈多、結果各月均漲一角半至三角、查賣岀大孚二千七百担、森康二千五百担、同興二千五百擔、益昶一千四百担、長豐一千三百擔、生源二千一百擔、通記二千八百担、錦昌一千六百担、潤康二千三百担、源興昌二千一百担、長和一千九百担、買進穗隆二千四百担、源大二千四百擔、慎昌一千六百担、慎記一千九百擔、潤康二千擔、賡豐三千三百擔、長豐四千四百擔、恊成一千八百擔、生源一千六百擔、崇安一千五百担、益豐一千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>廠需不過零星　現棉消費、仍屬平滯、廠需均係零星交易、</p>
<p>火機花　四○·二五　申新廠進　三○○包　現貨送廠</p>
<p>東溝花　四○·六○　申新廠進　三○○包　現貨送廠</p>

<p>沙市花　四三·二五　永安廠進　一○五件　現貨送廠</p>
<p>美棉平弱之狀</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、三月期多頭了結、各月跌二至五磅音、旋因同業日本利物浦及紐奧崙買進、發現反動、全日交易、大都由三月調至七月、至遠月新花、因政府對於新棉政策尚未决定、同業均在等候、其後市况堅穩、市價站在上日低峯之上、收盤時現貨未動、期貨漲跌一至二磅音、據棉業交易所估計、自八月一日起至一月三十一日止、全世界消費為一二、三八四、○○○包、去年同期為一二、七○二、○○○包、内美棉為五、八八三、○○○包、去年同期為七、一○○、○○○包、英棉市况疲弱、現期貨均跌三點、印棉有少數投機家買進、計平果爾跌一羅比、奧姆辣及白羅溪跌○·二五羅比、原電錄左（二十五日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十六日白羅溪花之開盤預測為二百四十七羅比、較上日收盤跌一·五羅比、</p>
<p>附蘭貢輸岀棉花量如下、</p>
<p>二十五日孟買電、上週從蘭貢方面輸岀棉花數量為七、七五五包、計至利物浦者二○○包、至神户者七、五五五包、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>期粉徘徊近穩遠軟</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼漲、下午則漲而復跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥祗好四分、坎拿大好四八分左右、當開價時、因前日金價收盤回漲、致一般浮空、均隨時抵補、至本月份雖標凖同趨不振、惟現貨則甚緊軋、市氣遂覺安定、遠期亦因空户抵補、較前日計回漲一二分不等、廹至下午開盤、各月份市况、初甚平穩、旋以本月份有浮多回岀、遠期各月份又因金市之重入下游、市塲投機、又頻頻放空、廠方亦有一部分小數岀檔、故市面又轉跌勢、照滙率之不穩、恐前途尚有小面也、結果本月份較前日好半分、三月份至五月份好二厘半、六月份反跌一分、七月分小二厘半、</p>
<p>期麥大勢平穩</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、依然呈平寂之象、以洋麥報價、祗好四八分左右、故開價時、祗三四月份尚有交易、因買户有限、人心難振、初跌一二分、旋則回定、迨至下午開盤、以上午粉市回堅、各月份喊價、隨之提高、不過在金市摇摇不定之際、前途市面、殊少把握也、結果三月份漲五分、四月份漲四分、現麥市面、尚呈平穩、以存貨不豐、受殺為難耳、開歸德麥三元八角半、由信大辦去、</p>
<p>河米銷呆跌角許</p>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源續稀、祗共二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）本街銷塲仍滯、僅包胃有青島烟臺帮辦一千餘包、故疲憊市况、尚難轉機、繼之銀根問題、人心恍惚、致大局形勢、常呈萎靡之態、而各厚粳價終見續跌落角砠至角餘、晚稻貶數分至角砠不等、杜尖未見嫩開、陰變元繼步軟風、（滬北）昨天時陰濕、何下各路到船約二三十號、市上各貨去胃、甚為懈淡、市價中次白粳及早稻價小一二角、薄稻高者價小數分、中次者價短角外、陰變元價短一角、其餘各價、亦見疲勢、</p>
<p>客秈與次洋米平定</p>
<p>——到頭不絶人心甚軟——</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、形勢甚軟、因市上存底充足、而連日到期甚湧、蓋以前定貨以二三月份為最多、一月定貨尚未到齊、二月份定貨連接抵埠、故近日日有抵埠、奈去化並不加增、故市面愈見無神、昨日開岀西貢四千五百包、暹邏米二千五百包、小絞五百包、統計只有七千五百包、而新到則日有數萬、惟三號與碎米到存較少、去胃反旺、市已暫定、一二號米則仍在看小中、客秈昨有本街内地兩帮趁小辦裝、市亦轉定、全市開岀不滿一千包、然以存底逐枯、後運不劃、人心與市面均已安定</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>潮青看漲原因有二</p>
<p>汕匯降去三十四元　地價又漲二角</p>
<p>昨日糖市、國産潮青、以汕地價又報漲二角、同時汕頭匯水反降三十三四元、無形中成本又須加起三四角、而地頭存底又缺、故現在脚地極堅挺、號貨因之觀望少岀、僅兄二百餘萬、高黄崗青為十元三角、次貨九元八角、查現在辦本、如提青划申已需十一元二三角、隆青亦須十元、進岀倒懸過甚、後市開價、勢必轉漲、似可斷言、海南赤零星稍有成交、為十元六角、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨無成交、轉口貨粒子較粗者四元九角半、太古糖Ｂ嘜十八元零五分、比降五分、本廠綿白振裕一號十六元七角、二號十六元六角、三號十六元四角半、四號十六元三角、比降一角、振記小包一號冰二十一元四角、二號二十一元三角、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>剪口鐵推銷不易</p>
<p>剪口鐵因農村破産、鄉銷大减、兼之近來銀根緊廹、鄉人因無力購買、所以市塲中大有供過於求之概、標準因市氣閑散、頗多下游、昨市估價如原來字板估四元四角、狹條四元三角半、方塊五厘五元六角、又七厘半五元一角、又一分二分四元八角、又厚花色四元五角、小方塊四元二三角、聞昨日成交祗三四百担、係四川漢口諸帮辦去、此外甯波杭州湖州以及青島烟台天津諸帮、俱無交易、惟本埠同業因推銷不易、心思奇軟、故來日行情、頗有續疲之勢云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>聽聽李頓的調子</h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>九一八事變後，李頓爵士負着解决「滿洲問題」的擔子，到遠東來走了一遭，隨後回到日内瓦去發表了所謂「維持東亞和平」的「滿洲調查團報告書」，之後，報紙上關於他的消息就漸漸少見了。</p>
<p>在調查團的報告書上，李頓主張滿洲應由國際來共管，不應該祗由日本一國來獨佔，這主張在日本自然是不會同意的，誰願意把到口了的肥肉再吐岀來呢？就是三嵗的孩子也會曉得這是徒然的事。於是李頓爵士在日内瓦碰到了一鼻子灰，日本也就在各國底「不承認僞滿」的原則下退岀國聯了。</p>
<p>最近，李頓又在美發表了他關於滿洲問題的見解，其實這些見解還依舊是三年前載在調查團報告書上的老調：一樣是「請求日本合作」，給大家（各帝國主義者）來「共謀滿洲之發展」吧了。</p>
<p>當然，在不損害日本在滿的利益底原則下，日本是非常歡迎各國在滿投資的，就是李頓也承認「日本對於滿洲事件之處置，於經濟之關係上，應予相當之諒解」，這所謂諒解，自然是就着日本在滿的特殊地位而言，日本在滿的特殊地位，正是由於以武力來造成了這個傀儡的「滿洲國」。</p>
<p>「李頓續謂：國聯對於滿洲事件之處置，並不失敗，蓋因國聯之地位，原以批評為政策，固不以軍隊施行其信仰」（十一日華盛頓國民新聞電）。其實國聯這個招牌，老早就給日本踏汚了，李頓還説什麽失敗不失敗，實際上那里還能够争回些什麽幌子呢！「最後，李氏以為日本雖可以和平方法，謀滿洲之發展，然日本軍隊必須撤回，然後始能保持世界各國之好感也」。（十一日華盛頓國民新聞電）。李頓希望日本撤兵，固屬無望，但李頓自然也不是傻子，不會不知道日本是不肯撤兵的，可是在國際的舞臺上，調子可不能不嚮亮一點，以博取人家的同情。然而實實在在，他們的骨子裏卻是别有懷抱的，最近的報紙上不言曾經透露着英國將派商業考察團到滿洲去麽？</p>
<h3>福老頭兒</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>福老頭兒的岀走，和他的矮小不堪的土屋裏，却來了一個陌生的中年婦人，像過勞的耕牛似的喘的氣，低低的倚在門檻啜泣着。這消息傳遍了村上，引起了全村好奇的婦人和幸災樂禍的小孩子，都趕集到他的門口來看熱閙，把矮小的土屋，團團的圍住。</p>
<p>福老頭兒，蹩了一隻右脚，走起路來西個肩膀一顛一簸的摇曵着，據説這隻左脚是年青的時候偷女人偷岀毛病的。他—約莫有四十開外的年紀，爛南瓜似的小腦袋，多半的頭髮是脱掉了，頭頂亮光光的像一片擺平的臘石頭。那張瘦長的三角臉上，嵌着一對鼬鼠兒眼，掛着兩片厚黑的嘴唇，上唇上綴着幾根灰色的貓兒鬚。雖則他的容貌生得不十分好看，然而，一年四季，不論是冬是夏，祗要碰見了人，他的嘴角上總是浮現着一抹迎人的輕笑，這倒也使人樂意和他親近。</p>
<p>村上自有了福老頭兒的足跡，於是，村上的那些喜事，䘮事，都委托在福老頭兒的身上，今天東家要他去接新娘的花轎，明天西家要他到親戚家里去報䘮。這些已成為福老頭兒的專門職業了。同時，他對於這些事情，也特别的比其他的人有經騐，而且做得也十分周到。因此，村上人家有事，都少不了福老頭兒一個人了。</p>
<p>幾年前，那時福老頭兒的年紀還青，同時，村上的人家，也似乎比現在來得富裕，對於他們家里所發生的喜事䘮事，特别敢花金錢舖張得多麽堂皇，闊氣，有勁兒！一請客人，起碼就是十天八天，熱閙得家里的雞狗也不甯靜了。這一來，福老頭兒不但用不着在家裏獨個兒弄飯食，給人家呌去帮忙，每天還有五角錢的工資可以收入，此外，還有許多客人的「外快」和「油水」。把他的荷包裝得滿滿，他臉上的兩隻鼬鼠眼，嫵笑得更加細小了。</p>
<p>福老頭兒，每天除愛喝一兩杯「白酒」之外，其他的嗜好是没有的。就連他年青的時候所最愛好的女人，這時對於他也好像分外地厭倦了。他自從飄流到村上來住，態度就變得非常的規矩，正經，從不曾為了女人的事情，而閙岀岔子來。因為他辦事的精明勤謹，幾年來克勤克儉，也還有一些積畜，可助來放給村上做小生意的人家，每年收進來一點厚息。</p>
<p>當他做完了白天裏的工作，喝過「白酒」之後，帶着幾分酒意，闌珊珊地拖着那雙東家送給他的半舊的緞鞋，很幽閒地跑到祠堂前的石階上來納凉，看看天空里鱗鱗的晚霞。這時，階上那些年紀彷彿和他差不多的人，總會用半像正經半開玩笑的口吻對他説！</p>
<p>「老福，你怎麽不討個女人呢？難道一生就像和尚的過嗎？」</p>
<p>「女人……討厭的東西！」他望望天空，翻轉着他那對滿網着紅絲的鼬鼠眼，隨後把眼皮緊緊地閉着。「像這樣多乾净，女……人！」聲音過緩地，帶着復感的氣分，像鉛般的沉重。</p>
<p>「你從前不是已經討過女人嗎？」那些人好像有意試探着他他的來歷。</p>
<p>「幹嗎天氣是這麽的悶熱！天公再不下雨，真是要悶死人了。福老頭兒却是轉掉了話頭，於是，很巧妙的，他們的話題就轉到天時去了。</p>
<p>關於福老頭兒突然岀走的消息，和他的矮小的土屋裏來了一個低低啜泣着的中年婦人，引起了平靜的村上的騷動，謎般的互相推測着。</p>
<h3>上吊</h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>「周瑞生的祖母，昨天夜裏在家裏上吊自盡了。」</p>
<p>一淸早，這個消息就傳遍了全村子里。接着就有各種各樣的議論在這村子里的街頭巷尾播傳着。</p>
<p>「像周瑞生那樣兄弟三個，還養得個老母上了吊。」</p>
<p>「在這年頭兒，活着倒要受苦，死了到也乾净些。」</p>
<p>「真是着了瘟疫似地，新年起來這村子里到死了不少了。餓死，凍死，投井，上吊，什麽都閙起來了。」</p>
<p>「天真没眼，這樣年成不好，還呌人活得下去嗎？」</p>
<p>就如上面的這幾種議論，巷頭巷尾都有人在説。有些人是大罵周家三兄弟的不孝，一個老母都養不活，有些人却是詛天咒地的罵神罵鬼，説不保佑生靈，但也有一種是知道是年成不好的造成，或是天有定數的命應該絶，更有另一些人是看慣了，不當一回什麽了不起的事。總之，誰的心里都有一個觀念，不管是對的抑不對的，大家都在發議論。一個平時極靜默的村里，却為着周家的事，閙得怪熱閙。</p>
<p>程家祠的程老伯，大淸早也就給周家死人的這件事閙醒了。在家里聽着巷口女人們的混雜的議論，心里也就不耐煩起來，吃過一碗很稀的粥，也就獨自一個的跑岀來了。</p>
<p>程老伯已經有七十多歳了，在這村子里，合他這樣年紀大小的也没幾個了。所以對於這村里的什麽事情都懂得，什麽人好，什麽人壞，那一家是不錯，那一家是窮的，諸如這些事，他都知道得很詳細的。至於年成好壞，村里死人多少，他也看得很多，幾乎看厭了。不過像去年那樣壞年成，死人的接二連三的，這在他這一大把年紀，到是第一次見到的。</p>
<p>走在路上，巷口路邊的談話聲還是一句句很尖鋭的刺進他的耳里，他雖感到那些説話的人可厭，但也只好悶着肚子的走着。他脚在走，心却在想：</p>
<p>「媽的，這些小伙子合妮子們，死人死人的不知談些什麽？説又説不岀道理來，却要死命的談。人家死了一個老太婆干你們鳥事，只是這樣嘰哩咕嚕的混熱閙。在這年頭兒死個人還算得什麽，再死十個吧，也是那末一回事的。」</p>
<p>他愈想愈不高與，那路旁巷口談話的聲音却好似更尖鋭，好容易他才走岀了村門。</p>
<p>村門外的田野間是一片的寂靜，只有樹叢下的枯葉合枝混在一起給風括得有點兒吱吱地響。程老伯這時站在田塍上，太陽照着他的臉，風拂着他的白色底鬚，他心里感到一種很自然的舒適，他望着眼前那一片廣漠的田野，泥土都犁得鬆鬆地，他就料想着今年的年成是必定會好的。</p>
<p>他撫摸着自己的臉，捻一捻鬍子，臉上露岀一絲的笑紋，在田塍上徘徊的走動着。他心里的念頭兒也一陣一陣的湧上來，他想：</p>
<p>「今年的年頭兒該好一點了吧？活了這一大把年紀，從没見過去年那樣閙大荒，那樣的餓死，凍死，自盡的人那麽多，那班小伙子們總聽到有人死就大談直談，全不想做一點兒正經事，真是……」</p>
<p>他想到進里，望望那一望無際的已犁得鬆鬆地田里的泥土，心里一轉想，縐着眉頭的自語着：</p>
<p>「唔！去年犁好的田地也有這未鬆呀！？可是……」</p>
<p>他心里一沉，不然而然的也想起周瑞生祖母上吊的事來。</p>
<h3>全部生財</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>舊夢懷戀曲</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>在那邊，海的盡頭，南島緑色的椰林下，曾經印着我徘色的無痕的輕夢，戀的踟蹰的銀踪。夢裏邊；深嚐着花朶似的香嫩的血唇的情熱！躺在葉子蔭影掩護之間靜靜地聽温柔曲打青春的姑娘的歌喉裏音樂風一樣的唱岀來。年輕的姑娘有動人的給我一段美妙的幻想夢樣的眸子，眸子裏醖釀着少女詩意的秘密，使我常常浸到一個忘我的甜馥的境地裏。而為了那太重的戀的賜物，我會担心着自己没有相同的承受的份兒，反於是感到一種莫名的憂煩惆悵。</p>
<p>夢終於是天邊的星子那麽一聆眼便隕墮了。美麗的夢如同已化為黑烟，化為碎片的狼籍的落葉，現在我只有在慘黯的回想中，無言地拾起腿色的殘破的往事，但它已不能與我一點兒慰情之感，向有負創的心窩再刴了猛然的一刀，此外，我惟有忍受莫大的哀痛，眼巴巴看着青春最後的醇露一滴滴流了下來。</p>
<p>弦琴繼了綫條了，輕軟的聲息也没了，我還能瞧見什麽，聽見什麽？長日裏眼眶裏儘是氤氲着濛濛的淚花，一切的幸福全讓渡與淚泉和嘆息。</p>
<p>我本就願過去的種種永遠聽從時間的塵埃厚厚的掩殁着，再也没有心腸來追尋，而無端招領些難堪的刺傷。可因為我的心並未完全死了的，我怎能够就那樣遺落了曾使生命有過大大的震蕩，大大了沈醉的舊夢。但當挑燃起似乎模糊又似是明晣的往事的回意的時候，頓然之間我簡直會失去了知覺，身子彷彿一隻繼了綫的紙鳶兒那麽摇晃在半空，整個兒被回憶的無形的烈火熨炙着。</p>
<p>明知逝了的歡悮無從去追求，没了的倩影亦無從去喚回來，這正如落下來的雨珠無論如何是一不會飛回到天下。然而我徧死在這秋風吹到了人間　　　了一樹花葉的深秋時分，忘想聽取鶯鳥的輕唱，找尋鮮緑的花的顔色。</p>
<p>遼闊的大地教我走向何處逢着我的舊夢呢？天是那麽的高遠，海是那麽的無邊際，而路程又是那麽的迢遥，迷霧似的迢遥的南島的舊夢啊！你年輕的姑娘，你的情心真是氣候一船難猜度，我見到了你是怎樣的不容易，怎樣地的用盡辛苦，可是不見了你却是這樣的輕快，你頭也不回的便悄悄地去了。你知道昔日終朝繾綣的人已作他鄉的流落者，雖然這其間，已淡漠了人世一切的繁華，但淡漠不了的祗有你，還依然天天在想念着你啊！你給我的印象太深刻了，無情的時間雖為我的生命掛上灰色的袍袴，而你永遠有着一個輕倩的微笑的細麗的面影，却還是明晰地刻在我的心坎，像一座催毁不掉，金色的彫像。因此我淪溺於不能自拔的囚牢中，如今我是在無歡愉也無希冀的宕過歳月，在流浪的長途上蹣蹣着唱自己生命的薤露歌；我不覺得一點惋惜，也不怨埋誰，一切可誇處的事已不屬於我，正同年青的姑娘已另屬於他人一樣。不過，終有一日吧，你年青的姑娘的一切也有不屬於你自己的時候，而感到人生的寂寞的。</p>
<p>可是我祝福你不會有這樣的日子。現在你貽增我這份甜味的同時也是痛苦　　　　　算是不薄的紀念品了。</p>
<h3>走脚訊</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>我們的故鄉，是一個矗立在驚濤駭浪中底孤島；週圍是水，没有旱道可通，然而水程也不過籍着幾條民船來往而已。</p>
<p>那兒有幽麗的風景，也有名勝古蹟，昔乾隆下遊江南時，也曾到過那兒的。現在龍洞石公兩山，和蘇州的獅子靈巖一樣，經他勅封過而仍舊禁採山石，御筆題字也還很淸楚的留在石壁上面。鄉人們的生活很樸實，風欲也十分敦厚，長在這孤島上的人，一百人中至少有九十五人没有岀過省，甚至連這孤島也没離過寸步。從太平天國之後，這里却没有受過兵災，鄉民都安居樂業，咸視為世外桃源的樂土。那兒更有很豐富的土産，不過自從連年天災以來，這孤島上也就不如往昔了！</p>
<p>在這樣一個週圍數千里的孤島上，人們都三五家一起的散居着；有時在一二十里路内全是荒郊，竟找不到人烟，也有走不上三五步，却又有一個村落。人們多數務農為生，但近年以來，却也有不少岀碼頭去經商的。</p>
<p>這里没有郵差，祗由郵局岀了十大元僱了一個鄉人傳遞消息，這送信的人，我們都呌他「走脚訊」的。他每天淸晨負了一個包裹，將隔夜沿途收下來的信件送到分局裏去，（所謂分局者，就是一家雜貨舖門前　掛了一塊代售郵票的牌子而已，這也是受縣裏郵局津貼的）。以便由民船載往縣局。他却從分局裏去分送。每一封信送到，他得取六枚銅</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>子的脚力，明片新聞紙减半，這可算是收信人的額外損失。然而有一樣，寄信人却會佔上些小便宜的；那就是寄本山的信不用貼郵票，他自會給你送去向收信人收取脚力。</p>
<p>較遠的信，他並不當天送去，必須俟有了好幾封才一起送去，所以往往一封信要七八天收到也説不定的。</p>
<p>他走過我們的家，早上總在七點鐘光景，下午却須黄昏時候了。</p>
<p>「走脚訊的，你老好呀！現在仍舊是你在走脚訊嗎」？我這次返鄉，他送信來的時候，我不禁這樣的問他。</p>
<p>「是的，這苦差使有誰要幹」？他説是苦差使，其實真不知有多少人在羡慕這苦差使呢！</p>

<h3>三育並重智力兼授的好萊塢特殊的學府（下）</h3>

<p>如果讀者懷疑到，這樣小小年紀的兒童，就教他練習演講，或背誦詩詞，究竟適宜與否，露茜格麗爾有驚人的紀錄請你看。她能證明一年級的小學生，每年能背誦四百行以上的詩，能每星期自己構思，自己演説一次。他們在大庭廣衆之中，一些没有羞澀驚慌的毛病。再則，這些孩子們極喜歡在大衆面前，登台演講或背誦。這種記憶和演講的八作，是從一年級起到九年級止，一些没有間斷的。所以自覺，或是在大衆前面，心神的不平甯，在受過訓練的宼蒂司學生方面，可以説是絶無僅有的。</p>
<p>在初小的時期，吉梅的中飯一定要在校内吃的。他在一年之中，可以學到許多良好的吃飯習慣。學校裏有食物學的專家，和醫生等。他們擬好了吉梅的菜單之後，就照大家平常所吃的，略加增减，以配合各兒童的需要。譬如説，吉梅第一天在校内吃中飯的時候，他看見飯盤中有牛奶。他最討厭牛奶。他又看見菜蔬，亦是他所最恨的。他覺得很不高興。但是盤裏還有一大塊燒羊腿，還有水菓和一塊蛋糕。他就專吃他所喜歡的。他時時眼望着他的先生露茜格麗爾。他恐怕她要譴責他，但是她却一些不注意他，使他覺得奇怪起來。他在家裏反没有這樣自由。</p>
<p>但是不久，他看見别的孩子，常常到厨房要第二杯牛奶。還有孩子上課的時候肚子餓了，特為告了假去要牛奶喝。他覺着牛奶必定是樣好東西。於是，他在不知不覺之中，就漸漸喝起牛奶來了。吃菜蔬亦是這樣逐漸而來的。在他們没有吃慣菜蔬之前，露茜格麗爾使他們吃多汁的植物質的湯或生菜，使他們同樣的得到維他命甲，乙，和丙。但據露茜格麗爾所説，普通的小孩子，都喜歡啃蘿菔，芹菜，或吃菠菜之類的東西的。</p>
<p>第一年完畢的時候，吉梅已經會説幾句法國話，會在游泳池中游一個來回。他的削肩，亦都平了，他脚底的拱形，亦漸漸高起來了。他的體重亦到了平衡的地步。他每月檢查身體一次，每四個月由齒科醫生檢查口腔一次。到了四年級，他開始學打拳，要臉上吃得住拳頭，不許掉一滴眼淚。他亦練習着二十五碼賽跑。他亦學習了打網球正確的姿勢。他亦不怕馬而喜歡騎術了。他並且敢仰天向後躍入水中。他並且已經成了一個社交舞的專家。他亦會翻筋斗，打虎跳，或用手走路。他亦學習了水上救人的工作。此外還有棒球，足球等等，亦都是每個男學生所應當懂得的。</p>
<p>那裏亦有一個戲劇班，那是每個學生所喜歡參加的。却利卓别麟的兩個兒子，却爾斯和雪尼，還有勞倫斯梯拔的兩個雙生子，勞倫斯和理查，却是賦有表演天才的兒童。</p>
<p>如果吉梅有一個姊妹的話，她入學之後，所受的體育訓練，是完全和吉梅一樣的，除去了打拳之外。但是女子除去了一種打拳，却添加了許多柔軟工作，舞台舞，射箭，以及室内籃球等。</p>
<p>等到杏梅進了七年級或八年級他已經漸漸對於文學或詩詞，發生了興趣。他並且岀乎他母親意料之外的，能欣賞莎士比亞了。很可幸的，教吉梅莎士比亞的教授，並不是一位斷章取義，或專事推敲的老學究。他用淺近而極精確的語言講明了之後，就呌每一個學生，扮演劇中的一個角式。這樣，他們對於莎翁的著作！就更增進了一層了解。</p>
<p>當然冠蒂司學校的功課，包括中學所應有的一切功課。凡是冠蒂司學校畢業岀來的學生，都可以直接考入程度最高的大學。那裏面所有的功課，無論是科學或文學，都是很精深嚴謹的，雖然每個學生得就其性之所近，而選擇植物學，生物學，或地質學等專修的名目。譬如説，吉梅已經第九年級了，他選擇了專修地質學一門，預備他進大學的時候，可以直進大學的地質學班。或者不進大學，他亦可以在一家油礦公司中，充當一個地質測騐的學家。</p>
<p>以上的説的，並不見宼蒂司學校造成一個良好國民的全部工作。宼蒂司學校更重要的工作，在訓練兒童的禮貌，自制的能力，使成一個可靠有用的公民。他要學習尊重别人的權利，能容忍能合羣。他在公開演説的九年練習之中學到了一種折服人家的技能，庶幾他們將來入世之時，不至於被人輕視為一個不辨菽麥的紈袴公子了。（完）</p>
<h3>瓊克勞馥自述登台表演的野心</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥是近在她的勃倫脱華高地住宅中，蓋了一個小戲院，在那游泳池的旁邊。屋頂是白的，四面是不加油漆的木板砌成的墻，簡單而别緻。却帶着些神秘的氣息，因為外面雖然有人談論着，但没有人進去過。瓊的一位老同學去看見了，問她做什麽用？瓊告訴她説，在拍片子中間閒空的時候，她要在那裏登台做戲。以下就是她所以要登台做戲的理由：</p>
<p>她説：「我不能永遠做一個電影明星。要對得起我自己，我一定要求發展。我所需要的很多，　　台　經騐，就是其中之一」。瓊自己　責她自己説：「我缺乏自信的能力。我没有安詳的態度。我常常自己覺得自己的可憐。往往在試片的時候，我整天不能吃飯。等到片子試完了，我就差不多成了一個廢人了。我一定要想法子糾正這種毛病。我祗有從舞台上設法。我不在求名，我要的是經騐。</p>
<p>「但是那裏來的時間呢？照我的合同，我一年要拍三張片子。公司有權呌我多拍一張，總共要拍四張。一張片子亦許拍五個月之久。第二張片子什麽時候開始，我有没有預告。所以，我雖想登台表演，却没有時間去表演，並且没有時間去練習。因此，我祗可在自己家中，先練習試演起來。那就是在攝片閒空的中間，召集幾個知己的人，在家裏排演戲劇。」照瓊的意思，她喜歡演古裝戲。或者她第一次排演的是「神女貞德」。</p>
<p>「除此之外呢？」她的友人問。這一問却又發現了瓊更大的野心。她非但想登台表演古裝劇，並且還想表演歌劇。她每天練習一小時的唱歌。她的喉嚨極寛，有三個音級的伸縮。她在早晨六時，和午飯時，都要練練嗓子。她説：「我在第二張片子裏，就要開口唱歌了。那是我生平第一次。你願意聽嗎？」她説着，就取岀幾張留聲片岀來，放在留聲機器上唱了起來。果然聲調悠揚動聽，使她的老同學都驚奇起來。</p>
<p>瓊本來是個野心女子。她在十二年以前，本來是什麽？本來是什麽？大概知道的人很多，五六年以前，她還不過是個平常的舞女。但是她富有野心，不斷地自己訓練自己。現在她已是紅極一時的大明星。她既有這種登台表演，以至於上歌劇塲的野心，誰能阻擋她呢？她現在還不過二十五六歳，前途還遠大，我們且拭目以俟吧。</p>
<h3>英片源源而來聲中「羅馬快車」不日開映</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>英國影片，近來大有進步，這是衆所共知的事實。從各國電影刋物看起來，他們在全世界電影市塲上，已經佔有最優勝的地位。中國電影院所開映的英國片，雖没有美國影片那麽多；但是在過去一年中，有幾張片子，是曾轟動一時的。</p>
<p>近在國泰開映之「春色無涯」，也是英國影業巨頭高蒙公司的岀品，成績怎樣，已經是人所共知的了。此片映後，即將陸續公映的，尚有萬國影片經理之「彩虹曲」</p>

<h3>學童慈母（Grand　Girl）（三）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>尼泊通是一個黑人，他那黑得發亮的臉，和一對白多黑少的眼睛，已不是從前畏縮可憐的一個小學生了。那個時候，他因為功課不及格，被梅立斯拉到校長室裏，他流着淚告訴密司貝爾斯，因為家窮，他晚上還要做工賺些錢貼補家用，所以就將功課荒棄了。密司貝爾斯聽了他的話，覺得他可憐。她銀行裏存欵不多，但却簽了一張二十五元的支票給他。她自己留了十七元五角，心想不久就要發薪水了，不要緊。再則她再隔兩年，就有一筆養老金，她老年的保障，所以她也不為金錢而憂慮。</p>
<p>她很和氣地向着他們三人道：「你們有什麽事？」華德走到前面説道：「密司貝爾斯……我們……」他停了一停，於是急速地説道：「我們來告訴你，我們是心向你的，不管别人怎樣」！威廉倍登亦道：「不錯的，密司貝爾斯」。尼泊通亦連忙説道：「不錯的，一定如此」。那校長口裏謝着他們，心裏却不覺一陣難過起來，感激的淚充滿了她的眼睛。她伸手在她的大布袋裏摸手巾。她摸到了一條手巾，就向外一抽，不想兩顆骰子亦跟了岀來，掉在桌子上，成了一個七點。那是戴德的骰子，在他和她的學生賭博的時候，被她捉着了搶過來的。</p>
<p>這時尼泊通看見了一個七點，兩眼睁得銅鈴大，不覺喊道：「一個天然」！貝爾斯不覺奇怪道：「尼泊通，你説的什麽話」？尼泊通指着那兩顆骰子道：「一跳跳岀來一個七點！我覺得有此……我覺得……」他説着就抓起了，那兩顆骰子，往桌上一抛，不覺失聲喊道：「神聖的吉各帝！又是一個天然」！貝爾斯問道：「什麽？你呌七點呌天然嗎」？尼泊通亦不答她的話，仔細拿着骰子看哩。他看了半天，忽然喊道：「喂，這不是什麽骰子！這簡直是個月份牌，上面是三百六十五個七字。你看，左也是七，右也是七。密司貝爾斯，你從那覺得來的？這是有毛病的」！</p>
<p>密司貝爾斯不覺驚奇喊道：「有毛病的」！她又氣又憤恨地，向着窗外望着戴德的地方，忽然她眉頭一縐，計上心來。她於是對着她三個學生道：「你們兩個人可以去了，留尼泊通在這裏」。她又對着尼泊通道：「你留在這裏。我要和你説話……談談這個可恥的賭博，你所深知道的」。説着心裏未免得意。等到華德和威廉點着頭退岀去了之後，露蘭貝爾斯立即掉過頭來，對着尼泊通道：「好尼泊通瓊斯！現在你告訴我一切你所知道的，關於這可惡的遊戲」！她一邊玩弄着那兩顆骰子，一邊沉思着。</p>
<p>又是一天的下午，像一個勇敢的戰士上戰塲一樣，露蘭貝爾斯走進了戴德的地方。在她的大口袋裏，有一張支票，她的薪水，計共二百五十元。她已經從尼泊通那裏，學到了這抛骰子的一切方法和術語。露蘭自己笑道：「一個好教師，常能從他的學生方面得到些學問的」。這個時候，正是將近晚飯時候，那個地方還是空空的。戴德看見她進去，似乎吃了一驚的問道：「你又來做什麽」？露蘭貝爾斯檢了他旁邊一個凳子，坐了下來笑道：「没有什麽」。她故意嗅着戴德的晚餐，稱讚着它的味道；戴德説那是他自己煮的。他説話之間，露蘭故意時時糾正他文法錯誤的地方。戴德於是又問道：「喂，你到底是來做什麽的？難道是來替我糾正文法的嗎」？（未完）</p>

<h3>行車時汽油消耗量增加的原因</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>購買汽車的時候。車主第一個最關心的問題。就是每里的汽油銷耗量。但是每里的汽油消耗量。究竟有多少。這實在是一個很難確定的問題。各國的工程師曾經把這個問題合力的研究。在各種不同的狀况下。做過數十次的試騐。終究没有確實的得到結果。不過汽油消耗量的大概因素。不外下列數種。（甲）路面的的粗細。（乙）燃料的種類。（丙）乘客的多寡。（丁）輪胎的軟硬。（戊）路面的種類。（己）路面的斜度。</p>
<p>同一輛汽車。在粗劣的路面上行駛。每里汽油的消耗量。要比在平滑的路面上行駛增加百分之十。劣等的燃料。牠的每里消耗量要比佳質的燃料來得大。因為這種劣等汽油。牠的燃燒熱量。（每一單位）非常的弱。雖然價格便宜。結果反不經濟。試騐的結果。用這種劣等燃料駕駛。每里消耗量要增加百分之八。</p>
<p>乘客多的車輛。整個車身的重量要增加。因之地面的反動也隨着增加。這樣一來。就需要巨大的馬力使車身推動。這種巨大的馬力。非需要多量的汽油不為功。據試騐的結果。車重每增加一噸。每里的汽油消耗量要增加百分之十五。這種結果很難預料的。</p>
<p>打氣不足的輪船。足以增加地面的阻力。同時就增加掣動的馬力。汽車消耗量就隨着增加。這種消耗量增加的確實數目。現在尚未有結果。因為輪胎内的空氣壓力。常常在變換的縁故啊。</p>
<p>在柏油路上行駛。每里的汽油消耗量非常之省。但是在混凝土路上行駛。汽油消耗量要增加百分之十二。這因為阻力增加的縁故。煤屑路和石子路上行駛的消耗量。比較要增加得多。大概增加百分之十七。</p>
<p>路面的斜度。和汽油的消耗量。關係最大。向上行駛（上橋或上斜坡）的時候。因為需要多量的引擎能力去推進車身。汽油的消耗量就隨着增加。每百分之二的高度。汽油消耗量就要增加百分之四。向下行駛時。如其把油門關閉。讓車身趕着惰性滑下。那麽汽油就要省去百分之三·六。所以向上向下行駛的平均汽油消耗量。剛好相抵。</p>
<p>速率的大小。和汽油消耗量也有很密切的關係。但是同時候也要顧慮到路面狀况。光滑的路面上行駛。雖然速率增加。但是輪胎在路面上的阻力却因之减少。需要推進車身的能力。就隨着减省。每里的汽油消耗量。自然减省不少。反之。粗劣的路面。因速率的增加。使阻力大大的都加。每里汽油的消耗量。就要增加得很快。</p>
<p>速率愈快。空氣的阻力愈大。這種空氣阻力。適足以過分消耗引擎的能力。增加每里的汽油消耗量。新式汽車的車身雖然極端流綫化。但是終究免不了空氣的阻力。所以這種汽油消耗量。是不能免除的。併且牠隨着速率而增加。</p>
<p>除掉上述的幾種原因外。還有一個似乎不重要而實際緊要的問題。就是引擎的阻力。引擎的内部。大都是金屬與金屬間的接觸和摩擦。這種接觸和摩擦。都有極大的阻力在裏面。所以當引擎掣動時。一部分的能力（可説是一大部分）是用來抵消這種阻力。其餘剩下來的一部分能力。用來推進車身。所以引擎阻力愈大。則每里的汽油消耗量愈增。設計不良的汽車。往往有此弊病。設計較佳的汽車。因為潤滑的改進。汽油的消耗量已减到最低。不過總没有方法去完全除掉這種阻力啊。</p>
<p>現在我們可以歸納的説。每里汽油增加的原因。是（一）路面的粗劣。（二）空氣和引擎阻力的增加。（三）路面斜度的增加。（四）輪胎的軟弱。（五）汽油的省等。（六）車身載重的增加。</p>
<h3>一律裝配鋼頂之赫德森與地上飛</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>説者以為一九三五年度。當必為汽車史上最關重要之一年。蓋以鋼質車頂。即於斯年實行採用也。致鋼車頂為一般工程師所認定之目標者。十五載於兹矣。自其外表言之。似甚簡單。無關宏指。但其實則鋼頂完成以後。若干繁複問題。即皆圓滿解决。如由車主方面而言。鋼頂之採用。實足使全鋼車身。因而益臻堅强。彌極安全。乘客既可安坐於全鋼車廂之内。而同時復可利用最新式之四季通風系。以享受極度安適。按此項通氣裝置。蓋亦汽車界之最新進步也。</p>
<p>赫德森車身製造廠。專門精造各式車身。以供赫德森及地上飛汽車裝配之用。廠中工程專家多人。對於鋼頂問題。殫思竭慮。悉心研究者。歷有年所。彼輩並皆承認。採用鋼頂。不僅使車身搆造。倍臻鞏固。抑且大有裨於外觀及安全。惟所以未即實行採用者。則以頗多窒碍難行之處故也。按此種障碍之一。厥為由車頂扁闊隔膜面自然發生之一種聒耳聲音。應如何方能避免是也。至此外又一問題。即金屬物之天然漲縮。對於車身搆造。影響殊多。自非設法消除之不可。凡此問題。兹幸已告解决。所有一九三五年式赫德森及地上飛轎車。因皆可裝配鋼頂焉。至其使鋼頂絶對安靜之方法。尤為巧妙。其中若干原理。乃效法無綫電工程師。對於聲音波動之管理。以一種物料。施用於車頂。於是車頂自然發生之聒耳聲音。遂即因相互抵制。而消滅於無形。再因採用此種搆造方法。車身外觀。彌極宏偉壯麗。而其堅强鞏固。亦因而登峯造極。逈不可及。新車車身與底盤。今已成為真正全鋼組合之整體。絶對不受氣候或漲縮影響。其搆製之堅强卓絶。蓋已為汽車工程界所一致公認矣。</p>

After the resumption of postal services inside and outside Guan, the public feels quite convenient.

It is rumored that the forwarding bureau is financially strained and has requested subsidies, but the bureau has not received any official documents. Regarding the construction of post offices in various places, a loan of 1 million yuan has been borrowed from the Savings and Remittance Bureau. For example, the Nanchang Transportation Building is being jointly built with the telecommunications agency and will be completed soon. The Changsha Administration Bureau, the Chengdu Post Office, and the Wuchang First Class Bureau have all been designed and are in progress, but the funds are still insufficient, and it is planned to continue borrowing. The second phase will build Yichang, Shashi, and Shanghai Central District bureaus, which will still require further borrowing. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Shenxin No. 7 Factory Auction Incident</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>At a time when Shanghai's economy is in depression and various industries and financial circles are running around to rescue the market, unexpectedly, HSBC Bank, as the first pledgee, entrusted Rouice Moyer &amp; Co. to announce the auction of the factory base, houses, and machinery of Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 7. The industry, with a value of more than 5 million yuan, had a limited price of only 2.25 million yuan. Although the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai, also as creditors, applied to the First Special District Court for provisional attachment, and the court ruled to implement it, and business groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the central government to find a way to stop it in order to protect property rights and industry, under special forces, Mr. Murakami, a Japanese lawyer representing a certain party, purchased it at the lowest bid price yesterday. We believe that HSBC Bank's move, if it were in a boom period, would not be criticized, but it is being published today when credit is extremely tight, so it must be regarded as a great regret and considered to have serious significance.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the tension in the Far East situation, the British have different views, and their policies towards China have not been consistent. The front line in China is quite fragmented. One faction, represented by HSBC Bank, adopted a strategy of abandoning the rights and interests of North China and the Yangtze River Basin, and transferring cash stored in Shanghai to Hong Kong to preserve its strength and wait for political developments. However, due to excessive cash transportation, the inventory was slightly empty, and a run on deposits once occurred last year. Although it calmed down soon, it might not have been so quick without the help of Chinese banks. Later, the bank authorities made preparations for Chinese deposits and had a plan to absorb cash. The long-discontinued banknotes were re-promoted and used indirectly by various foreign firms. Expiring deposits were attracted with high interest rates to prevent them from flowing out. All of these are factual manifestations of the bank's strategy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that HSBC Bank's auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory is actually a necessary stage to implement its recent China policy. The purpose is not only the one household of Shenxin No. 7 Factory. Unfortunately, "Shen No. 7" was sacrificed under the first trial of their bull knife. Speaking from HSBC Bank's standpoint, if this kind of extraordinary means is not adopted, the debts in Shanghai cannot be quickly settled. It seems that there are reasons for doing this urgently. However, the attitude of disregarding property rights and disregarding it decisively makes people turn pale at the mention of a tiger. Strengthening Sino-British friendship to benefit commerce should be what the general British businessmen hope. How to remedy the misguided policy of disregarding property rights is what the British business community should pay attention to today. It seems that our financial industry should also have considerable preparations for this. If our banking industry is only focused on maintaining strength and has no concrete countermeasures, I am afraid that national industries will have less and less protection in the future.</p>

<p>[Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee resolved on the 26th to approve the regulations for collecting house tax in various counties of Jiangsu Province, as well as the provisional measures for accommodating drug offenders sentenced by military law institutions in new and old prisons. The measures for collecting house tax are as follows: all counties in Jiangsu, whether they have implemented a house tax or not, will uniformly collect a house tax, divided into shop houses and residential houses. The tax rate for shop houses is 15% of the monthly rent, and for residential houses it is 8%. For self-produced shops, the property value will be estimated, with a tax of 1.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The tax rate for residential houses is 8 jiao per 1,000 yuan, and the same applies to mortgaged properties. The house tax for shop houses will be borne equally by the landlord and the tenant, while the tax for residential houses will be borne solely by the landlord. Houses with a rent of less than 2 yuan are exempt. The house tax will be paid monthly by the tenants. A surcharge of 10% will be added for payments overdue by 10 days, 20% for 20 days, 30% for 30 days, and 50% for two months. The regulations will be implemented starting from March 1st and will be handled by the tax collection offices of each county. It is reported that the collection of house tax in Jiangsu Province this time is not to increase the burden on the people. The public security expenses of various counties mostly come from the house tax, which is collected by the public security organs themselves. The tax rates also vary greatly. In order to reorganize the public security expenses of various counties, these unified measures have been formulated to standardize the tax rates and ensure uniformity.

<h3>Amidst Pro-China Sentiments, Japan Worries About British and American Actions</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministry Issues Unofficial Statement</p>
<p>Says the Principle of the Premier and the Hirota Policy Coincide</p>
<p>East Asian Peace Hinges on Sino-Russian Understanding of Japan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Most European and American countries are jealous of the improvement in Sino-Japanese relations and are devising various strategies. The Foreign Ministry made the following unofficial statement on the 25th: (1) The reason why China has recently understood Japan's China policy is that the fundamental policy of the National Government, the Great Asiaism of Premier Sun, completely coincides with the East Asiaism advocated by Foreign Minister Hirota. (2) When the Manchurian Incident occurred, the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States in attacking Japan was that it was disrupting the peace of East Asia and even the peace of the world. They asserted that there was no way to solve the Far East problem except to establish friendly relations between China and Japan. Today, seeing that Sino-Japanese relations have improved, they are making statements and actions to obstruct them, even advocating Anglo-American cooperation, which is ridiculous. It seems that what the United Kingdom and the United States truly hope for in East Asia is to disrupt peace and prevent Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, the East Asia policy of the United Kingdom and the United States can be said to have exposed its true colors, etc. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] A Japanese Upper House member questioned the foreign policy yesterday, saying that the United States is the least understanding of Japan on the issue of the disarmament conference. Why doesn't the Foreign Minister reach an agreement with the United States first, so that diplomatic peace can be hoped for, and replace it with the five-nation treaty of Japan, the United States, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom? The Foreign Minister said that the United Kingdom and the United States are equally unable to understand Japan's position on the disarmament issue, and it is impossible to distinguish who is easier or more difficult. Japan is not afraid of the United Kingdom and the United States not understanding Japan, and only seeks that the two major neighboring countries, China and Russia, can understand Japan. China's attitude towards Japan has made great progress, and Russia is also gradually understanding Japan. The issue of the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been resolved. Japan plans to further resolve outstanding issues with Russia. It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry plans to resolve the following issues with Russia as soon as possible: (1) The Japan-Russia Fisheries Treaty, (2) The issue of the exchange rate of Japanese and Russian currencies, (3) The border issue between Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo." Regarding the first and second issues, the Japanese side proposed convening a conference in Tokyo to revise the Fisheries Treaty, and the Russian side has already accepted its principle, but the Russian side's instructions on the location of the meeting have not yet arrived.

<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Concrete Plans with Hirota Yesterday to Enhance Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Cooperation Between the Two Countries Must Be Based on Equality</p>
<p>Wang Changes Date to Leave Japan for Europe on the 5th of Next Month</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because Dr. Wang Chonghui has many people to talk to, he has postponed his departure from Japan. Wang was originally scheduled to take the President Coolidge to the United States on March 1st, but now he plans to take the Empress of Canada instead. His departure date is approximately March 5th. This morning, Wang and Hirota and Shigemitsu held talks for about an hour and a half. In the afternoon, he visited Army Vice Chief of Staff General Sugiyama. He plans to visit Hakone tomorrow. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, Wang discussed concrete plans with Foreign Minister Hirota to enhance Sino-Japanese friendship. According to Wang, he feels that Hirota's views on Sino-Japanese cooperation completely coincide with his own. Wang told Hirota that Japan must abandon its self-elevated attitude, because enhancing relations between the two countries must be based on equality, etc. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Wang Chonghui visited Foreign Minister Hirota on the 26th to express his farewell and expressed his gratitude to all aspects of the government and the public. The following is a transcript of his conversation:</p>
<p>The impression I received from the Japanese government and the public this time can be summed up in the word "excellent." I am very pleased that I have been able to convey the true intentions of the Chinese people to various important figures in your country. At the same time, I am confident that I have been able to fully convey the true intentions of your country to the Chinese people. China and Japan, in accordance with their historical destiny, are aware of their responsibility as fundamentally and substantially responsible for peace, and trust each other to realize equal and mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of friendship and understanding, and contribute to the establishment of world peace. This belief is deeply rooted in the minds of the people of China and Japan. On this point, I have been able to achieve half of the purpose of my visit to Japan this time, and I should thank the gentlemen from all aspects of your country for their efforts and kindness. I also hope that your Excellency will continue to assist in the establishment of Sino-Japanese cooperation on the basis of this friendship and understanding in the future.</p>
<p>After Foreign Minister Hirota expressed the above views to Wang, he also said that the feelings that the Japanese government and the public have expressed to Wang this time are also the feelings of the entire Japanese people towards China. The concrete foundation for friendly cooperation between the two countries is strongly advocated to be established on this occasion, and Wang's efforts this time are praised. It is also hoped that he will come out and assist in the future. After visiting the Foreign Minister, Wang visited Vice President of the Privy Council Hiranuma and former Foreign Minister Yoshizawa on the same afternoon, and they exchanged frank opinions with each other.

<p>[Tokyo] On the evening of the 19th, Wang Chonghui met his old friend Wu Zhenlin on the evening of his arrival in Tokyo. Wang and Wu were classmates at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom and were both Chinese diplomats. Wu married the niece of Japanese House of Peers member Izawa Takio and served as Acting Minister to Japan and Minister to Peru. Later, he resigned due to an incident. His wife died of illness, and he went to Japan to live his impoverished life. Hearing about his recent situation on Wang's visit to Japan this time, he immediately invited him to the Imperial Hotel and advised him to take up a government post again and do his best for Sino-Japanese friendship.

<h3>Aichi Prefecture, Japan, to Send Personnel to China</h3>

<p>Promoting Sales of Woolen Textiles</p>
<p>Nagoya: Aichi Prefecture produces 120 million yen worth of woolen textiles every year, most of which are shipped to overseas markets to compete with foreign goods.

<h3>Simon Decides to Visit Berlin to Hold Direct Talks with Germany and Britain</h3>
<p>Further Discussion of the London Declaration</p>
<p>Whether to Go to Moscow Awaits Cabinet Decision</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon recently stated in the House of Commons, "I hope to go to Berlin in the shortest possible time. As for the question of whether to go to Moscow and Warsaw, it is currently under study." Simon also said, "The German government's proposal for direct talks between Britain and Germany has been accepted in principle by the British government." The Labour leader in the House of Commons, Lansbury, immediately asked whether the government had already made any statement regarding the German proposal. Simon replied, "Yes, after receiving the German proposal, the British government inquired of the German government whether the direct talks between Britain and Germany mentioned in the German communication could include a further discussion of the issues raised in the Anglo-French declaration of February 3. Subsequently, I received a reply from Germany confirming this interpretation. Based on this foundation, I was invited to go to Berlin. The British government believes that this German proposal is very beneficial, so it hopes that I will go to Berlin as soon as possible. The date has yet to be decided, and the detailed procedures for this trip are still being prepared. The governments of France and Italy have both approved this plan." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Although Foreign Secretary Simon's statement in the House of Commons today was reserved regarding the trip to Russia, it is generally believed that after Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden go to Berlin, they will probably go to Moscow, or perhaps even to Warsaw. If important results are achieved in the Berlin talks, Simon and Eden may temporarily return to Britain and then go directly from Britain to Russia and Poland. The British government believes that if the countries cannot conclude a general mutual assistance treaty, then it is necessary for the security to consolidate and strengthen the existing diplomatic constraints between the Eastern European countries. Therefore, it is essential for British cabinet members to visit Russia and Poland. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The Times reports that the decision on whether Foreign Secretary Simon will make a trip to Moscow after visiting Berlin will be made at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Some cabinet members believe that Simon should return to the country upon leaving Berlin, and at the same time, the British ambassadors to Poland and the Soviet Union should consult with the governments of those countries on the issue of an Eastern European mutual assistance pact to ascertain whether it is necessary for the Foreign Secretary to go to Moscow. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Speculation on British-German Talks [Paris] The French newspapers are all paying attention to the issues of guaranteeing Austria's independence and concluding the Danube River Convention.

The Austrian authorities, therefore, have a more secure belief in the country's future." "L'Écho de Paris" reports that the Danube River Convention will inevitably be the target of the talks during Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin, and issues such as the air mutual assistance pact, disarmament, a general convention, and Germany's return to the League of Nations will also be discussed. As for the "North-Eastern European mutual assistance pact, it will be reserved and not discussed, and the French and German authorities will continue to consult in order to seek a solution." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>France Prepares for Reception [Paris] In tomorrow's State Council meeting, Foreign Minister Laval will report on the results of his talks with Austrian cabinet members and present the progress of the negotiations between Britain, France, and Germany regarding the London agreement. British Foreign Secretary Simon will probably arrive in Paris by plane on Thursday. Tomorrow's State Council meeting will discuss the reception arrangements. After Simon arrives in France, the British Ambassador to France will host a luncheon to welcome Simon. At that time, the British and French Foreign Ministers will be able to gather and talk directly. In the evening, Simon will deliver a speech, stating the purpose of his visit to France, and will be hosted by the Allied Nations Club. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Important French Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>[Paris] At this morning's cabinet meeting, chaired by President Lebrun, many domestic and foreign affairs cases were discussed. Foreign Minister Laval will take the opportunity to report to his colleagues on his talks with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and all diplomatic negotiations between Paris and London and Berlin, and will discuss the British Foreign Secretary's trip to Paris. Although the French government recognizes that this trip is of a private nature, it will take advantage of Simon's stay in Paris to exchange opinions. Simon was originally scheduled to come to France on Thursday morning, but some newspapers reported that Simon has advanced the date and will arrive here on Wednesday. At the same time, Laval successively met with the Yugoslav, Czech, and Greek ministers, all of whom were inquiring about the French authorities' talks with Aubin. This visit took place after Aubin's visit, which shows that the Little Entente countries attach great importance to the Franco-Austrian negotiations. It is reported that the German Foreign Minister told the ministers that the Franco-Austrian negotiations have become consistent, and reports say that the issues in the Danube River Convention have reached a mature stage, and cooperation between Austria and its neighboring countries is also showing promise of success.

<h3>Famous French Journalist Doubts British Attitude</h3>
<p>[Paris] Today, the famous French diplomatic and political journalist, Bodinart, published an article in "L'Écho de Paris," expressing indignation at British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Berlin and direct negotiations with Germany. According to Bodinart's prediction, after the British Foreign Secretary arrives in Germany, he will grant Germany certain concessions that France will find difficult to accept. Bodinart also said that Germany has already won the first step when Britain accepted its invitation, and the strength of the Anglo-French talks is balanced by the exchange of opinions between Britain and Germany, allowing Britain to occupy the position of an impartial arbitrator in the spirit of the Locarno Treaty. According to Bodinart's observation, this visit by the British Foreign Secretary to Germany is also related to the elections in Britain, so it is bound to have some results, at least in appearance it must have a successful form. Bodinart pointed to the British Foreign Secretary's attitude as belonging to the "unstable" side, and as for what he called a certain concession, he said that future local treaties will inevitably lose the components of mutual assistance and military agreements, and these components are indispensable to the agreements currently under discussion. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>British Newspapers Express Joy [London] The Times commented on Foreign Secretary Simon's trip to Berlin, considering it a cause for celebration, saying, "The current European situation is serious, far from ordinary. Since Britain can use its influence to enable all related countries to accept the proposals in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3, the reason for Foreign Secretary Simon's trip to Berlin is easy to understand." The right-wing Conservative "Morning Post" seems to no longer oppose Foreign Secretary Simon's proposals to go to Berlin and Moscow, saying, "Once a conflict occurs in the East, the West cannot be unaffected. Anyone with a little common sense will have to admit it. Therefore, it is appropriate for Britain to send politicians to mediate between Berlin and Moscow." The extreme Conservative "Daily Express" has always taken an opposing stance, saying, "What kind of hope does the British cabinet have in going to Germany and Russia, and what can it achieve?"

<h3>Purpose of Austrian Chancellor's Visit to Britain</h3>
<p>Seeking Financial and Military Assistance</p>
<p>To Resist German Influence from Moving East</p>
<p>[London] Austrian Foreign Minister Weidegger stated today that if Germany and Austria want to maintain friendly relations, the National Socialist Party must stop interfering in Austrian affairs. Weidegger made this statement during a special interview with the Associated Press reporter after arriving here. Weidegger also said, "Austria's independence has been confirmed, so we are not afraid of Germany interfering in Austrian affairs again. As for the friendly relations between the two countries, they can only be restored if the German authorities abandon all demands on Austria. In the future, unless Austria is recognized as an equal and independent country, we will not be willing to discuss Austrian affairs again. However, if a meeting is held based on this principle to solve diplomatic difficulties, we would be happy to participate. If Germany accepts this case, we would also be very happy to restore normal relations." It is widely rumored here that the real purpose of Schuschnigg and Weidegger's visit to Britain is to get Britain to allow the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy. According to the official announcement of the nature of the meeting, Austria requested Britain to allow assistance to the Austrian government to resist the forces of the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and to provide financial or military assistance when necessary. Another theory is that Schuschnigg's trip is to raise a loan in England, so he is scheduled to meet with the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, once. Semi-official sources have paid close attention to Weidegger's aforementioned remarks. It is said that it can be seen from this that the Austrian political system will not be changed. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>British-Austrian Talks Largely the Same as Paris Talks</h3>
<p>Restoration and Loan Issues Not Mentioned</p>
<p>[London] The issues discussed in the British-Austrian talks are completely consistent with those discussed in the Paris talks. The results obtained are also largely the same as the results of the Franco-Austrian talks, that is, to recognize that the Austrian Republic should maintain complete independence in all respects. Today, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, Foreign Minister Weidegger, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart held talks, which lasted a long time. The main part of the talks was about the treaty on non-interference in Austrian internal affairs. According to the Austrian side, if Austria is subjected to foreign interference, the signatory countries can directly consult with Austria, and non-signatory countries can also consult with Austria through the mediation of the League of Nations. Although this British-Austrian talk is only exploratory in nature, it is actually very important. The Danube River Convention will be one of the main issues in the British-German Berlin talks. Now, before Foreign Secretary Simon goes to Germany, holding talks with Austrian cabinet members can clarify Austria's position, which is of great benefit. As for the issues of the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy, increasing Austrian loans, and the amount of the army, they were not mentioned at all in the British-Austrian talks. Although the Governor of the Bank of England, Norman, visited Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg today, what was discussed was about Austria's old loans, such as loans handled by the League of Nations. It is also generally believed that when Schuschnigg met with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain this afternoon, they discussed whether Britain could advance funds to enable Austria to purchase railway materials from Britain to renovate Austria's railway equipment.

<h3>Austrian Chancellor Declares That Political System Will Not Be Changed</h3>
<p>[London] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg recently declared to representatives of the international press, "We do not adopt a dictatorship system because of building Austria. This kind of evolution is contrary to our nature. No one in our country wants it to be realized." Schuschnigg then talked about Austria's national strength, saying that if Austria can exchange what it has with foreign countries, it can survive independently without having to unite with other countries.

<h3>German Newspaper Commentary Exposes National Socialist Party's Intentions Towards Austria</h3>
<p>Said Austrian Government Insufficient to Represent Public Opinion</p>
<p>[Berlin] The semi-official German News Agency commented on the declarations made by Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Weidegger in France, saying that the declarations were quite surprising to the German people, because the Austrian government does not represent the Austrian people, and its weak foundation can be seen from this. The Austrian government is deeply afraid of holding a referendum. If a referendum is held, the government will inevitably be overthrown by the majority of the people. This kind of argument should be from the instructions of the National Socialist Party. The National Socialist Party's intentions towards Austria can be seen from this, because the National Socialist Party believes that if Austria holds a referendum, the National Socialist Party will inevitably be able to obtain a majority.

<h3>French Interior Minister Criticized by the Right Wing</h3>
<p>Due to Insufficient Protection of Representatives of Friendly Countries</p>
<p>[Paris] Recently, right-wing newspapers have been very dissatisfied with Interior Minister Regnier. The reason is that when Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg visited Paris a few days ago, the French authorities could not provide him with adequate protection, so Schuschnigg was unable to attend the Mass at the Church of Our Lady of Victory on Sunday. The French Interior Minister received a secret report beforehand, saying that someone was plotting to assassinate the Austrian Chancellor. The Interior Minister then advised Schuschnigg not to go to worship at that time. According to "La Paix," this conspiracy was indeed a fact, and the police authorities had received a report from a reliable source stating that "dangerous elements" had arrived in the French capital and would be detrimental to the Austrian Chancellor. "La Victoire" severely criticized Interior Minister Regnier's advice to the Austrian Chancellor not to attend Mass as "stupid and rude," because important figures in the French government, such as Minister of Justice Pinot, were waiting in the church. "L'Écho de Paris" said that the French government's secret arrival of the Austrian Chancellor in France had already ruined things in advance, and then failed to guarantee the personal safety of the representatives of friendly countries after they came to France, making one mistake after another, which is unbelievable.

<h3>US Navy Base Strengthens Strength Plan</h3>
<p>Needs to Spend 38 Million Dollars</p>
<p>Approved by the House Naval Affairs Committee</p>
<p>[Washington] The House Naval Affairs Committee recently passed a bill with a majority of fourteen votes to one, authorizing the Navy Department to carry out a plan to strengthen US naval bases. The naval bases along the Canadian, Panamanian, and Pacific coasts must be strengthened, with a total cost of 38 million US dollars, of which 15 million US dollars will be used to build submarine and aviation bases at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The House Naval Affairs Committee today approved an appropriation of US$38 million to rebuild the naval docks on the west coast of the United States, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Hawaiian Islands. The committee also approved that the Navy does not need to obtain special permission from Congress to double the funds for improving warships. According to existing regulations, the Navy does not need to request Congressional approval to improve any warship within two years if each ship does not exceed 300,000 yuan. Now the committee has approved this number to be increased to 600,000 yuan. As for the proposal to improve the docks, naval experts have long regarded it as very important. Some officials believe that the United States must prepare to build a large number of warships at any time. The lack of ships during the European War can be used as a lesson. Some experts said that after the government improves the docks, it can save waste, because national construction is cheaper than temporary bidding by merchants, but opinions on this point vary greatly.

<h3>Italian War Fever</h3>
<p>Troops Continuously Transported to East Africa</p>
<p>Italian-Ethiopian Negotiations at a Standstill</p>
<p>Messina The Italian government continues to plan a large-scale offensive against Abyssinia. Today, thousands of troops and countless war supplies departed from here again. The war sentiment throughout Italy has become white-hot. When the troops set off, tens of thousands of people went to the port to wave flags and send them off, and distributed flowers, cigarettes, sweets, and other things to comfort them. A ship carrying 1,200 engineers and a lot of military fire also left for East Africa. According to Italy, this time the dispatch of troops to Italian Somalia has reached more than 6,000 before and after, and there are still 10,000 people preparing to set off. At present, the responsibility of this army is only to assist the local 25,000 soldiers to protect the border and prevent disturbances in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has also concentrated 75,000 to 100,000 troops to wait for orders to attack. Ethiopian officials have repeatedly protested Italy's continued dispatch of heavy troops, pointing out that it is a provocative action. The League of Nations Committee, which is meeting in the Ethiopian capital, is also still trying to prevent the conflict between the two sides, but Ethiopia still deals with this matter with an indifferent attitude. The Ethiopian King still claims that he will rely on the League of Nations and his army to protect Ethiopia from Italian invasion. Therefore, it makes the Italian officials even more angry. Now Italy has ordered that merchant ships will be requisitioned for military use when necessary. From this, the urgency of war preparation has gone a step further. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The First Battalion of the Fascist Party Army, which left the port of Naples on February 10th on the Argentine postal ship to East Africa, has recently landed at the port of Massawa in Italian Eritrea. After being reorganized, they entered the city, and the people welcomed them along the way. The troops of the Belluno Division that have not yet set off have also left from the port of Messina for East Africa. Vice Minister of the Army Bestrocci went to Catania and Syracuse today to inspect the troops, and finally returned to Messina to inspect the troops waiting to board the ship. The "Count Biancamano" arrived in Messina this morning from the port of Naples, and will carry 2,600 soldiers and 3,000 tons of military equipment to East Africa. Bishop Benno of the port of Messina boarded the ship to deliver a farewell speech and bless the ship and its crew. When the ship set sail, the crowd on the shore cheered loudly. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia have not yet resulted in any agreement. According to Italy's previous proposal to Ethiopia, a neutral zone should be set up six kilometers away from the outposts of the two countries to avoid conflicts between the two sides. Ethiopia has accepted this proposal, but with a condition that Ethiopian nomadic people should be allowed to pass freely through the neutral zone, because there are a number of springs in the neutral zone. This condition was also accepted by Italy, but Ethiopia's request that one Belgian and one Swedish officer each participate in the neutral zone demarcation delegation was rejected by Italy. According to some foreign sources, Ethiopia has now abandoned this request, but Rome has not received any news, only saying that this matter is being discussed in the Ethiopian capital, but whether there are any results is unknown. According to foreign sources, Ethiopia requested submission to arbitration, but Italy did not respond. People here say that Ethiopia's note requesting submission to arbitration was only delivered on February 23, and Italy is now drafting a reply. Italy's opinion is that the solution to the dispute between the two countries should be divided into three steps: first, direct negotiations, if they fail, then mediation by a third country, and if mediation fails again, then submission to arbitration. Now that Italy and Ethiopia have begun direct negotiations in the Ethiopian capital, there is of course no talk of arbitration. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Invites League of Nations Commissioners to Tour Germany</h3>

<h3>Gran Chaco Triangle Land, Bolivia and Paraguay Fight to Death</h3>
<p>Ceasefire Deadline Expired Yesterday</p>
<p>Paraguay's Tyranny Is Despised by the World</p>
<p>[Washington] Paraguay today insisted on continuing the war in the uninhabited area, leading to its being despised by the world and denounced as a tyrannical country. Today is the expiration date of the three-month ceasefire between Bolivia and Paraguay. The League of Nations' ruling will not be in Paraguay's favor, but Paraguayan officials have heard in advance that member states of the League of Nations may adopt severe sanctions, so they withdrew from the League of Nations on Saturday night. At the same time, it is learned that the two countries will continue to engage in sporadic local battles in the Gran Chaco. The Gran Chaco War originated in 1879. Its position is between the Paraguay and Pilcomayo rivers, with waterways intersecting. It is a large triangular area filled with insects, 600 miles long and 300 miles wide. Bolivia and Paraguay each demand the land for their own reasons. The land is regarded by landlocked Bolivia as the only way to the sea. Although Bolivia is only 75 miles from the Pacific Ocean, it is impossible to reach it due to heavy mountains. Paraguay is also eyeing the land covetously, because its large area will actually double the area of Paraguay's land. Moreover, there are many plants in the wilderness, and their bark can be used to extract 30% of the bark quality. In 1932, representatives of nineteen countries gathered in Washington to discuss ways to resolve the dispute. At that time, 10,000 soldiers had sacrificed their lives in the war. Later, the issue was transferred to the League of Nations for handling. The League of Nations notified both sides that the war must end as soon as yesterday. Paraguay's withdrawal from the League is the reply to the League of Nations' notification. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Paraguay has announced its withdrawal from the League due to dissatisfaction with the League's attitude. The Consultative Committee established by the League of Nations to resolve the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia over the Gran Chaco will probably hold a meeting soon to discuss the situation caused by Paraguay's withdrawal and study how to continue the League's appeasement work.

<h3>France Supports US Proposal on Arms Supervision</h3>
<p>Britain and Italy Still Oppose</p>
<p>[Geneva] The US representative of the Disarmament Conference Committee has now decided to proceed with its proposal to establish a permanent League of Nations Committee to manage arms trade. US representative Wilson made this statement today, saying that he will amend the original US proposal to give the Permanent Committee the power to supervise and manage on the spot. In this way, the Committee can inspect factories that manufacture military fire, but the exercise of management power must take into account national feelings and must not become a source of conflict. Britain and Italy are currently opposing this proposal, believing that the US proposal is too broad and difficult to implement, while France supports the US position. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Suspicion of Sabotage in the Crash of the American Airship</h3>
<p>Prominent Engineer's Unique Observation</p>
<p>No Less Than a Massive Bombshell to the Investigative Committee</p>
<p>[Washington] The world-renowned airship engineer, Mr. Knabenshue, stated today to the House Licensing Committee that the reason for the crash of the airship Macon was that someone sabotaged the machinery. Mr. Knabenshue's declaration was nothing short of throwing a massive bombshell at the committee. However, the ship's captain, Mr. Wiley, declared that this was impossible. Thus, public sentiment seems to have calmed down compared to before. Mr. Knabenshue has been retired for several years, so he did not want to exaggerate his words, saying that the Macon was deliberately sabotaged. Mr. Knabenshue declared that if the process of the accident could be investigated, then you will be able to find that sabotaging the machinery was a major cause of the accident, and that the sabotage work may have been carried out during the airship's voyage. In response to the question of whether foreign governments were related to the accident, Mr. Knabenshue said, "I must beg to be excused from answering." Knabenshue explained that he did not believe that naval officers were involved in the conspiracy to sabotage the airship, and said that he respected American officers, so he did not believe they would resort to such a low tactic. He asked the committee and Congress to continue to adopt airships as a tool of national defense, especially in defending the West Coast. Captain Wiley, after hearing Mr. Knabenshue's statement, expressed his opinion, saying, "I do not believe that this accident was related to sabotaging the machinery. We always set up heavy guards around the suspension bridge of the Macon, and patrolled the entire ship according to the prescribed time. I believe it is even more impossible to carry out sabotage work during the airship's voyage." It is said that all seventy-three crew members on the Macon knew that they could not escape after the airship crashed. Therefore, it is doubtful whether there were spies mixed in who were willing to sacrifice their lives to carry out sabotage work. (Twenty-fifth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>London Silver Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[London] The price of silver has risen to 25 and 5625/10000 pence per ounce, the highest price since 1929. Financiers say that the rise in silver prices is mostly due to Indian speculators who expect the United States to continue buying silver, and they are buying it in large quantities. It is now estimated that India has purchased more than 150 million ounces. A paper published in the Financial News today said that the positive impact of the Chinese government's recent plan to encourage the return of silver smuggled out of the country may be offset by the rise in silver prices. Because the U.S. Exchange Equalization Fund must sell U.S. dollars to curb the rise in the U.S. dollar's exchange rate against the British pound, it will still buy a large amount of silver.

<p>Hong Kong Correspondence, Yang Jianping, the former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, was a confidant of Chen Mingshu. When Chen was in power, he was extremely popular. Yang was also able to understand Chen's intentions, so he was able to follow Chen everywhere and be appointed to high positions. When Chen established a pseudo-People's Government in Fuzhou two years ago, Yang was also appointed as a member of the Economic Committee. When the Fujian affair failed, Yang fled to Hong Kong with Chen. His private residence was on the second floor of No. 46, Village Road, Happy Valley. He was suddenly arrested by Hong Kong detectives at midnight on the 20th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>It is reported that when Yang was the Director of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, he embezzled 34,000 yuan of public funds and hid in Hong Kong. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government sent a document to Hong Kong requesting that Yang be detained and extradited to Shanghai for interrogation. The Hong Kong police authorities then ordered an investigation and learned that Yang lived on Village Road, Happy Valley. Therefore, English detective Mr. Murdoch, accompanied by several Chinese detectives, went to Yang's residence at midnight on the 20th and arrested Yang back to the station. When the detectives arrived at Yang's residence, Yang was still in a dream. After the detectives explained their intentions and showed the arrest warrant, Yang put on his suit and followed them to the police station.</p>
<p>After arresting Yang, the police authorities immediately prepared a document to the primary court accusing Yang of embezzling 34,000 yuan of public funds from the Shanghai Postal Savings Bureau. The case was handled by Judge Smith. At 11 a.m. that morning, Yang was brought to court. The government was prosecuted by Deputy Attorney General Fraser. Yang's legal advisor, Xian Wenlian, requested lawyers Zeng Jian and Luo Xiansheng to represent Yang in court. Lawyer Zeng first requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail, saying that the defendant should be allowed, but if not allowed, he would state his reasons. The prosecutor said that he did not absolutely oppose bail, but wanted to hear the reasons. Lawyer Zeng said that he had just read the arrest warrant, which stated that about two and a half years ago, the defendant worked in a government agency and embezzled 34,000 yuan of public funds. The defendant has been living in Hong Kong for a long time, and has not left Hong Kong for even a step in the recent six months. And a few months ago, the defendant had already notified the police station through his legal advisor that whenever someone arrested him, he was always prepared to go to the station to surrender. Under these circumstances, the defendant has no chance to escape. Therefore, based on these reasons, he wanted to ask the judge to allow him to post a fair amount of bail. He also said that the defendant has no property in Hong Kong, only cash in the bank. After listening, Judge Smith asked Lawyer Zeng, "Can he find two guarantors?" Lawyer Zeng said, "He is willing to use cash as collateral because he does not want to involve others." Judge Smith said, "Considering the amount of embezzlement, I think a guarantee of 50,000 yuan is the fairest." Attorney Fraser said that the Chinese government requested his extradition, and there was a treaty between them. This case is not an ordinary criminal case and should be handled with caution. He then cited precedents, saying that according to the bail precedents, the judge could allow bail in this case, but the bench did not absolutely oppose the bail, but opposed the cash bail. Fraser then cited the British extradition precedents to express his personal opinion, saying that if only cash bail was used, it should not be allowed. Now that the fugitive has been brought to court, the judge should be especially careful. For the sake of strict prevention, the bench advocated that two people (jointly or separately guaranteeing) should be attached with a security deposit. Lawyer Zeng said that it was difficult to find a guarantor, and his client was prepared to provide 50,000 yuan in cash as collateral, and that 50,000 yuan was already too much for such a common accusation. Judge Smith said, "That is true, but we must also consider strictly abiding by the treaty. Therefore, I believe that without finding two guarantors, bail cannot be allowed." Lawyer Zeng said, "That is true for ordinary extradition cases, but this case has special circumstances and cannot be compared. The Nanjing government must be aware of the whereabouts of its officials. How could it not know about the defendant's trip to the south? If he was really guilty, he would not have been allowed to live in Hong Kong and would not have dared to surrender himself to the police, and would have left Hong Kong long ago. This kind of fact is very excusable." Judge Smith said, "I will ultimately not allow a simple cash guarantee. Two people are required as guarantors." He then ordered the case to be adjourned for a week. At this point, Yang Jianping said the names of several guarantors, entrusting lawyers Xi and Luo to solicit opinions from everyone. Among those mentioned by Yang were Hu Hanmin, Chen Mingshu, Zou Minchu, Deng Ruiren and others in the political circles, and two Hong Kong gentlemen in the business circles. However, because that day was a race day, they went to the races and it was not easy to visit everyone for a while, and the court also stopped working in the afternoon, so Yang was detained, and it was learned that the police authorities had immediately reported the case to the Shanghai authorities.

<p>Farmer surnamed Xue Robbed</p>
<p>Dahai Sixteen Township, Seventh District, Punan, the home of Xue Yunzhang, a villager, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits last night (25th). Each had their faces painted with white powder and spoke local dialects. The leader held a box cannon and commanded the group. The rest held wooden sticks, iron rulers, ropes, etc. After entering the door, the victim woke up from his dream and was forced to hand over silver by the victim's mother, Mrs. Xue. She had nothing to give, begging for mercy. The bandits signed that you have a surplus, and it is useless to deny it. They then bound Xue's limbs, hung her in the side room, and her screams were not answered. While the bandits were smashing the cabinets and boxes, the neighbors heard something and quickly rang the gong to gather the crowd. The bandits did not dare to stay and fled in all directions. Although Mrs. Xue suffered no losses, her body has been severely injured. According to the mid-December of last year, the Xue family was also robbed, and they were also dispersed by the neighbors ringing gongs. There were no losses. However, the bandits paid attention to the Xue family, which was probably done by familiar bandits. It is said that the Xue family did have savings in the past and has already distributed them to their children.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Provincial Commissioner Assigned to Investigate Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>The Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee, in order to understand the implementation of opium prohibition in various counties, including whether any illicit activities have occurred since the establishment of local opium dens and retail shops, specially dispatched staff member Qin Manyuan to inspect the opium prohibition facilities in various counties of Su and Chang. He will also supervise the handling of opium offenders who surrender themselves. Commissioner Qin arrived in Cheng from Wujin on the 24th. According to reports, the provincial government considers opium prohibition to be the central task of the year. Many opium addicts in various counties have not yet been registered. Therefore, a self-surrender program is being organized for opium offenders, along with public awareness campaigns. On one hand, the Baojia system is being used to investigate and encourage opium offenders to surrender themselves. On the other hand, propaganda can be conducted in schools to make elementary school students aware that opium addiction is a shameful act. The current county opium rehabilitation centers are treating opium addicts. After the work is completed, the province plans to convert them into county hospitals. Regarding recent reports of abolishing or merging retail shops and rehabilitation centers, the province is still in the planning stage and cannot express its opinion. On the 25th, Commissioner Qin participated in the county opium prohibition association's publicity week for opium offenders to surrender themselves, staying for about two days before going to Wuxian, Kunshan, and Wujiang counties for inspection.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Large Number of Prisoners Escape</p>

The newly appointed County Magistrate Zhao Xiaosan has dispatched the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Security Squads to intercept and suppress them, while also telegraphing the province to request military assistance. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM on the 20th, taking advantage of the weak city defenses, eleven prisoners from the county jail, including Liu Dapao, Xia Bangyi, and Cai Qingbing, seized the guards' guns and escaped, heading west. Prison Warden Lü Yong immediately reported to the county government, which dispatched the 6th Security Squad to pursue them. Four were killed outside the west gate, and Wei Shengdou was captured. Six remain at large and are currently being actively searched for. By 6:00 PM, Ren's battalion of the 11th Route Army had arrived in Hefei from the province and was stationed inside and outside the city, greatly reassuring the public. The Wuhu Special Office and the Chaoxian County Government have also received orders from the province to dispatch teams to jointly suppress the eastern bandits. It is expected that they will be eradicated soon.</p>

<p>Special Dispatch</p>
<h3>Discussing Whether to Build Salt Warehouses on the Gan River at Jiujiang and Hukou; It is Better to Build Them at Jiujiang and Wucheng. (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhongbiao</p>
<p>3. Advantages of Building Warehouses in Wucheng</p>
<p>Wucheng is suitable for building warehouses and depots due to historical, geographical, and other factors, which can be explained in five points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Advantage in terms of transportation and sales. Wucheng is the confluence of the rivers in Gan Province, as mentioned above, especially convenient for Xiushui, Tonggu, Wuning, Fengxin, Jing'an, and Anyi counties. If warehouses are built here, the sailing transport from the above counties will not incur the cost of setting up stations midway, and there is the advantage of direct access by sail. This is beneficial to both merchants and navigation, far superior to Hukou. However, some argue: "Sailing transport cannot risk reaching Hukou, while Jianglun can uniquely navigate shallow waters to Wucheng. Commercial transport cannot set up stations midway, while official shipping can uniquely transfer cargo along the river? This is convenient for private interests but not for public interests, which is a one-sided view." It is not known that the government is actively dredging waterways. For example, the Fu River has been instructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to be planned by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, assigning counties along the river to dredge. Poyang Lake is specified in the General's Founding Strategy; how can it be allowed to silt up? However, the project is larger, and the time is slower. After the dredging, Jianglun will be able to reach Nanchang directly, let alone Wucheng. Even currently, Jianglun cannot directly sail to Wucheng only when the water level drops in autumn and winter. If the river water overflows in spring and summer, it is unimpeded. In the future, before the waterway is dredged, utilizing the spring and summer water to pre-store salt for autumn and winter will also be beneficial to both public and private interests?</p>
<p>(2) Advantage in terms of warehouse construction costs. Wucheng has historically been a river port in Jiangxi, so salt warehouses are numerous. In the future, the government will rent or buy them. If they are old, they will be repaired. If they are insufficient, they will be expanded. In my opinion, old salt merchants would not sit idly by and let them collapse. In this way, half the cost can build a warehouse, and half the effort can achieve twice the result. Compared to the cost of quarrying stones and filling depressions in Hukou to build from scratch, how much labor and cost can be saved?</p>
<p>(3) Advantage in terms of terrain security. Wucheng is located in central Gan, surrounded by water on all sides, purely a commercial port. In terms of security, it is truly unmatched by any place in Jiangxi. Evidence shows that in recent years, red bandits have ravaged the entire province. More than eighty counties have no pure land, but Wucheng remains aloof from the world, like a paradise. Merchants and travelers sleep peacefully, and chickens and dogs are not alarmed, which is sufficient evidence. If warehouses are built here to store salt, there will be no need for guards or treasures. It will be like having a city without walls, and a natural barrier without danger. No gold-encrusted city could surpass this.</p>
<p>(4) Advantage in terms of promoting local products. Major local products of Jiangxi, such as paper, hemp, and wood, are traditionally concentrated in Wucheng. Moreover, paper and hemp are produced in northern Gan (and a significant amount of timber). They are sold in the Yangtze River area. Often, sailboats transport local products to Wucheng and return fully loaded with salt. Wheel transport salt to Wucheng and then transfer it to paper and hemp. (In recent years, timber has also been transported out of the river by ships.) The wheel and sail transport does not go empty-handed. This benefits boatmen and promotes industry. At this time when bandits are being suppressed and all industries are declining, we are urgently seeking post-disaster reconstruction. Everything that can benefit the people's livelihood should be vigorously supported so that the people can ascend to prosperity early and eliminate banditry forever.</p>
<p>(5) Advantage in terms of workers' livelihood. Tens of thousands of people in Wucheng rely on salt directly or indirectly for their livelihood. If the warehouse is moved to Hukou, these tens of thousands of people will lose their livelihood at a time of high living costs. The weak will inevitably starve, and the cunning will embark on dangerous paths. The government is already in a state of starvation and drowning; how can it bear to do this? However, some argue: "Building warehouses in Hukou also requires workers. If you cannot bear the loss of livelihood of workers in Wucheng, do you only wish for the workers in Hukou to be on the verge of unemployment?" This is not the case. Hukou has no salt, but workers in Hukou may not be without food. It is merely "icing on the cake." If the warehouse is removed from Wucheng, the clothing and food of the workers in Wucheng will truly go with the salt. Why provide food after starvation, when it is better for everyone to get their food? Although the government is vigorously implementing streamlined sailing transport, according to the guidelines for salt transport passed by the Executive Yuan, there are provisions for opening paper mills, introducing employment, and immigrating workers for the drawn boatmen. This shows the government's concern for workers.</p>
<p>4. Conclusion</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, the convenience of transportation and sales, the cost of expenses, and the safety of the terrain are most important. Even for the remaining points, although they are inferred by the author, national policies are of great importance. If possible, a comprehensive calculation should be made. The ability to make foolproof plans can benefit future generations. The author was born and raised here, and the advantages and disadvantages are clearer. If the authorities' plan to build warehouses in Hukou is out of expediency and still needs further consideration, then I hope they will pay attention to my humble opinion. (End)</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Auctioned Shen Xin No. 7 Factory Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ignoring the First Special Court's Provisional Attachment</p>
<p>Taken Over by Japanese Toyota Spinning Mill</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shen Xin Textile Company's No. 7 Factory at 468 Yangshupu Road, valued at approximately 5 million yuan, was mortgaged to the British Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for 2 million yuan seven years ago, with an annual interest rate of 8%, resulting in an annual interest payment of 160,000 yuan. Over the seven years, the accumulated interest reached a staggering 1.12 million yuan. Upon maturity, due to the decline in the textile industry, the debt could not be repaid. Although Shen Xin was willing to repay part of the principal and all the interest and repeatedly negotiated with the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank resolutely entrusted the law firm of Lu Yishi &amp; Mouyang to announce the auction at 3:30 PM yesterday at the bank's location at the intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road. The factory land, buildings, and machinery were auctioned off for a limited price of 2.25 million yuan. However, the factory had been provisionally attached by the China Shanghai Two Banks, the second creditor, in the morning, so this auction was naturally without legal basis. The details of the auction and the responses from all parties are as follows:</p>
<p>History of Factory No. 7 According to the Guowen News Agency, Shen Xin No. 7 Factory originally belonged to a Japanese company called the Oriental Spinning Mill. Later, because the Japanese had no intention of operating it, Rong Zongjing purchased it for 1.8 million taels nine years ago. Due to the old machinery and spindles inside, it was improved several times, and the cost has reached more than 1 million yuan to date. In the past, when Yangshupu Road was still remote and land prices were quite low, someone once discussed with Rong to sell the land for 60,000 yuan per mu to be used for other purposes, but Rong did not agree. From this, it can be seen that the land alone is worth more than 3 million yuan. Today, it is sold for only 2.25 million yuan, which is extremely cheap.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful Prevention According to the Huadong News Agency, the authorities of the First Special District Court believed that the property rights had already been provisionally attached by the court, so the foreign firm had no right to auction it. Therefore, they sent personnel to prevent it yesterday, but the Lu Yishi &amp; Mouyang law firm stated that the business was entrusted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, so whether to auction it or not was up to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. However, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank ignored the court's prevention and still ordered the foreign firm to auction it on its behalf. Therefore, at 3:30 PM yesterday, the auction still proceeded as scheduled.</p>
<p>Auction Details According to the Central News Agency, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a room in the Lu Yishi auction house on Beijing Road was crowded with Chinese and foreign men and women, as an unprecedented auction with a minimum value of 2.5 million was about to take place. At 3:30 PM, a Westerner from the auction house took the stage and read out the contract between Shen Xin and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for half an hour. At exactly 4:00 PM, the staff called out the minimum value of 2.25 million yuan, and two Japanese people in the crowd immediately responded that they were willing to purchase it for 2.25 million yuan. When the staff wanted to increase the price for auction, no one responded, so the hammer was struck, and the two Japanese lawyers, Murakami and Okamoto, were determined to be the buyers. When the Central News Agency reporter asked them on behalf of which company they were purchasing, they refused to announce it. Later, after investigation by the Central News Agency reporter, it was said that they were indeed representatives of the Japanese Toyota Spinning Mill. They then went to the office with the staff of the auction house and paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rumors of Buyers According to the investigation by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the winner of this bid was the Dalian Steamship Company, a Japanese company, which was purchased by the Toyota Textile Mill on its behalf. On the surface, it was taken over by the Japanese, but in reality, the Dalian Steamship Company planned to convert it into a pier. The Huangpu Pier of the Dalian Steamship Company at 340 Yangshupu Road is adjacent to the Shen Xin No. 7 Factory at 468 Yangshupu Road. The Shen Xin Factory is on the east, and the company's pier is on the west. The company has always coveted it, and now its wish has finally been fulfilled. It is reliably learned that the company will temporarily operate the Shen Xin No. 7 Factory as a textile mill in the near future, but it will soon be dismantled and rebuilt into a pier. Converted to 68 mu of land, each mu is only worth more than 30,000, and all the machinery and equipment are free of charge.</p>
<p>National Indignation According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese people present at the time were mostly aware that Shen Xin No. 7 Factory had been provisionally attached by the China Shanghai Two Banks, the second creditor of the factory, yesterday morning, and that this auction had lost its legal basis and would inevitably involve negotiations in the future. However, they all expressed indignation that such a huge industrial enterprise was announced for auction in the foreign auction house and was purchased by the Japanese at a low price.</p>
<p>Court's Statement A Central News Agency reporter immediately went to the First Special District Court to visit President Guo. Guo was out, so the Chief Clerk received the reporter. According to him, since the China Shanghai Two Banks, the second creditor of the factory, had already applied for provisional attachment, it would be handled in accordance with the law thereafter.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Yarn Industry According to the person in charge of the Yarn Factory Federation, it is a pity that Shen Xin No. 7 Factory was auctioned off by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. China's yarn factories have been on the verge of collapse for a long time due to the impact of the social depression and the dumping of Japanese yarn. Although manufacturers have struggled hard, they lack support. Although the banking industry intends to help, they are limited in their capacity. Although the auction has already taken place, they should still fight for it on the basis of reason to prevent the huge industry from falling into the hands of foreigners. He also said that President Wang recently sent a telegram, which may not have reached the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank before 3:30 to negotiate.</p>
<p>President Wang's Telegram (Omitted above) The telegram also stated that the court meeting today had decided to first persuade the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank by Shanghai Mayor Wu to postpone the auction and to consult with the Ministry of Finance and Industry to discuss relief measures. Separate telegrams have been sent. Special reply.</p>
<p>Rong's Conversation A Central News Agency reporter met with Rong Zongjing, General Manager of the company, at 5:00 PM. Lawyer Guo Shouyi represented him in the conversation, expressing opposition to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's auction of Factory No. 7. The China Shanghai Two Banks had promised to advance 1 million yuan to repay the debt, but it was still rejected by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He also said that the various factories of the company pay more than 20,000 yuan in consolidated tax every day. After the shutdown of Factory No. 2 and Factory No. 5, the national tax revenue is reduced by 6,000 yuan per day, which is 180,000 yuan per month. If China's textile industry cannot be maintained, it will have an even greater impact on the country. The financial authorities had previously allowed the company's consolidated tax to be temporarily recorded on account, but in view of the national financial deficit, no points have been outstanding. In short, the financial authorities that collect the consolidated tax should provide relief to China's dying textile industry and prevent its collapse, which is an inescapable responsibility. As for future negotiations, the second creditor will be the focus.</p>
<p>General Labor Union's Telegram The city's General Labor Union telegraphed the central ministries yesterday, stating: To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and Minister Wang, also Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Wang, Minister of the Ministry of Justice and Administration, the entire union of Shen Xin No. 7 Factory has reported that the factory was founded by industrialist Rong Zongjing, and the total assets are worth more than 5 million yuan. In recent years, due to the decline of the yarn industry and the inflexibility of economic turnover, the entire assets have been mortgaged to the British Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for a loan of 2 million yuan. Now, it is unable to repay the loan upon maturity and is willing to pay all the interest and raise a part of the principal. After repeated negotiations with the bank, it was not allowed. The bank suddenly announced on the 26th of this month to entrust Louis Smo to auction all the assets, which concerns the entire industry and the livelihood of all workers in China. Please give assistance and save the property rights and industry. Based on this, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, relying on its economic power, has arbitrarily disposed of the assets of Shen Xin No. 7 Factory, which is obviously intended to destroy China's industry. Therefore, please send an effective ban to save it, protect property rights, and maintain industry. The Shanghai General Labor Union bows.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Central Government to Exempt Trading Tax on Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Stock Exchange is the Medium for Circulating National Debt</p>
<p>Should Generally be Exempted from Tax in Accordance with American and Japanese Precedents</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday presented a petition to the Central Political Conference, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating the matter: On the 25th of this month, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange and the brokerage association of the exchange jointly stated:</p>
<p>In a letter stating The proposal to levy a trading tax by the Ministry of Finance has prompted brokers from various exchanges in Shanghai to request the government to consider the concealment of merchants and to grant exemptions separately. Your association has filed a case on the basis of the situation, and our office is deeply grateful. However, the Legislative Yuan reviewed and revised the law, but no special exemption was offered for national bonds. The brokers of our office have repeatedly held meetings to discuss that if the government levies the same tax on public bond transactions as on ordinary company stocks, it will not only be meticulous and create an unprecedented precedent in the East and the West, but will also add restrictions to the promotion of national bonds at a time of economic difficulty. The harm to the national economy is unspeakable. According to the term trading tax, which originated in Europe and America and spread to Japan, the New York Stock Exchange in the United States in 1817 already had a prototype at No. 40 Wall Street. It was not officially established until 1863. The internal organization is large-scale, and all American railroad and bank stocks are considered to be the key to circulation. The government does its best to assist, so American economists have said that the foundation of the United States' financial stability is consolidated in the huge building on Broadway. Its support for the importance of the exchange is like this. In the Meiji year 20, Japan sent economic experts to Europe and the United States to study the exchange system, and followed suit. The organization of the exchange has been around for more than 30 years, and various laws have been completed. China's exchange law mostly adopts</p>
<p>Japanese precedents The Japanese Trading Tax Law was promulgated in March of the Taisho year 3. After several revisions, it was found to be difficult to implement. In April of the Taisho year 11, an amendment was promulgated. Article 5 of this law states that in the case of transactions on the exchange, the settlement of which is based on the payment of margin differences, the transaction tax shall be levied on the agreed amount of the transaction at the following tax rate. The so-called transaction tax is the transaction of the first type of local bonds or corporate bonds, the transaction of the second type of securities, the transaction of the third type of commodities. Article 7 states that the transaction of national bonds is not taxed. Japan's non-taxation of national bond transactions is a fixed article, and it is announced to the people. In addition, Article 15 of the Japanese Stock Exchange's Business Regulations, regarding long-term transactions of national bond tickets, does not levy a margin deposit on each broker who does not reach 10,000 yuan, but the exchange may levy it with the resolution of the board of directors when it deems it necessary. According to the transactions of the exchange, whether it is goods or securities, the margin is a necessary condition for the exchange to ensure the safety of both parties. Japan promotes the purchase and sale of national bonds.</p>
<p>To promote the purchase and sale Therefore, it does not hesitate to allow the exchange to take this risk and exempt the margin deposit, but it is also afraid that it is not safe, so it adds a proviso to save it. To sum up the two principles, Japan is doing its utmost to encourage the people to buy and sell national bond tickets, not to mention taxes. In addition, each country in the United States requires both parties to attach stamp tax to the sale and purchase of securities. The rules set by the New York Province of the United States also have a transfer tax, which is similar to the so-called transaction tax, but not for the sale and purchase of national bond tickets. According to the United States, it is obviously encouraging both parties to buy and sell bond tickets with all its strength. Moreover, the transaction of national bond tickets is promoted by the government to promote bond tickets, and the society promotes financial activities. Whether it is spot trading or futures trading, the benefits obtained are all approved by national policies and should not be considered speculation. In all countries in the East and the West, the long-term transaction of national bond tickets and other securities is mostly limited to two months. It is a common practice in the world for the transaction of national bond tickets to have futures. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the Legislative Yuan stipulated the Exchange Law, which has been convenient for merchants and people for six or seven years. If the futures trading of public bonds is mistakenly considered speculation and a new tax is levied, it is</p>
<p>To collect is to prohibit It turns away merchants and people to other industries in search of illegitimate profits. It not only loses the essence of legislation, but is also not the blessing of the country and society. Moreover, the economic center of our country is only concentrated in the corner of the concession. In case foreigners take advantage of the market, such as the operation of bonds by a certain foreign bank, one after another. Also, if the establishment of the exchange is horizontally added, the government is distressed by the formal restraints. If a certain savings society refuses to withdraw, the rise of a storm lies in the slightest, and the cause is often created here, and the result is there. The gain is very small, and the loss is great. The country has less transaction tax, so it hinders the lively circulation of this huge amount of bond tickets, and the aspirants are gradually encroaching. Brokers dare not use dangerous words to sensationalize, nor dare to echo. Each law is drafted in the East and the West and has been deleted and is not tired of being detailed. For example, Article 7 of the Japanese Trading Tax Law is also the one revised by Law No. 6 of the Taisho year 11. The Central Political Conference, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance are the highest political organs. The new tax regulations must be consulted extensively and deliberated to perfection. If it is beneficial to the country, it will be changed in the morning and evening. There is no suspicion or taboo. Otherwise, they will go against what they like, and even if they are ordered, they will not follow. The trading tax regulations recently passed by the Legislative Yuan. The Central Political Conference, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance should be concerned about the national economy in terms of securities with prices. The transaction tax on the public bond item.</p>
<p>Resolutely remove It is fortunate that all the above words have been checked. The Exchange Law of our country and the trading tax to be levied are all based on foreign legislation, so the American and Japanese systems of not levying the national bond coupon transaction tax are appropriate mirrors for our country's trading tax law. Moreover, our country's public bonds have never been issued directly. They are always first mortgaged to financial institutions and must be circulated in the market through regular auctions by the exchange. Only then can the bonds be sold successively and the mortgage coupons be successively recovered. The exchange is the only medium for the circulation of national bond coupons in our country, which is different from the direct solicitation of bonds to the people in other countries. We should follow the precedent of tax exemption in the United States and Japan to help the circulation of national debt. Otherwise, teach the gibbons to climb trees, and gradually incite foreign merchants to covet and manipulate. The various malpractices listed by the Association are not over-considered. Although this tax law has been decided by the Legislative Yuan, according to the current practice, the Central Political Conference, as the highest political organ, has the power to formulate legislative principles and transfer orders for reconsideration and amendment. The hospital department is the administrative主管官署, and also has the power to raise opinions and present them to the National Government for transfer orders for reconsideration and amendment. It is reasonable to present a document based on the situation, and pray that the department will review and approve the national debt item in the transaction tax law, regardless of the spot and futures, and generally exempt taxes in accordance with the American and Japanese precedents, and handle them quickly in accordance with the legislative amendment procedures, in order to assist the circulation of bonds, which is public convenience. Respectfully presented.</p>

<h3>Driving from Shanghai Directly to Europe for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Remarks by Swedish Explorer Dr. Sven Hedin</p>
<p>The Possibility of Restoring the Eurasian Transportation Line of Thousands of Years Ago</p>
<p>Swedish explorer Dr. Sven Hedin, at the invitation of the Ministry of Railways two years ago, along with experts and technicians, went to the Northwest to survey the Sui-Xin Highway, a journey that took eighteen months. After returning to Beijing, he repeatedly met with Chairman Lin, President Wang, and others, and then went to Wuhan to meet with Chairman Chiang. He returned to Beijing a few days ago, and that evening, he and his assistant, Dr. Norin, took a train to Shanghai, arriving here at 7:15 yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he met with Chinese and foreign journalists to report on the trip. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Dr. Hedin and his assistant, Dr. Norin, arrived at the North Station by train from Beijing at 7:15 yesterday morning. Those who went to the station to welcome him included the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires in China, Mr. Lin Guisi, and the Chairman of the Swedish Association, Mr. Norman, and others. After getting off the train, the doctor went directly to the Swedish Consul General's residence at No. 1 Kai Na Road to rest. He plans to meet with Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu in Shanghai and stay for three or four days before returning to Peiping and taking the Siberian Railway back to Europe.</p>
<p>Describing the Experience: At 2:30 yesterday afternoon, Dr. Hedin hosted reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers at his residence, vividly describing his experience for two hours. The journey was full of hardships, and his descriptions from the perspective of a geologist and archaeologist were particularly interesting. Dr. Hedin began by saying, "I came to China on August 23, 1933, at the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Railways to survey the Huan-Xin Highway. Accompanying me were three technicians from the Ministry of Railways, Swedish physician Dr. Homan, Swedish archaeologist Professor Pan Meng, and others, as well as four automobiles. We departed from Peiping on October 25, 1933, first to Guihua, and then through the Inner Mongolian desert, arriving in Hami, Xinjiang, on February 6 of last year. The entire journey was 2,000 kilometers long, and the entire route is indeed the most suitable automobile highway."</p>
<p>Rich Resources of Xinjiang: The doctor continued, "The area of ​​Xinjiang Province is almost equal to the entire Europe, with an area of ​​5 million square miles, and a population of only 3.5 million people. 90% of its land is desert, the continent farthest from the coastline in the world. Its resources are extremely astonishing, with very rich gold, silver, and other mines. West of Hami, there is a huge oil field. I once explored there 45 years ago and discovered mountain ranges parallel to the Himalayas, and the ancient city of Loulan from the Han Dynasty. Thousands of years ago, Eurasian transportation passed through this vast desert, through Xinjiang, and to Xi'an. During the Tang Dynasty, Chinese silk was transported to Rome through this route."</p>
<p>Disturbances Obstructed: "After we arrived in Hami, we went further west to Turpan, where we encountered disturbances in Xinjiang and the outbreak of war, experiencing great difficulties. Finally, we reached Aksu, on the border of the Soviet Union, through Toksun, Korla, Kuqa. My four cars were initially detained by the rebels as tools for escape, and later borrowed by Sheng Shicai's army for pursuit. After being detained for several months, and the disturbances subsided, Governor Sheng sent a guard of 50 soldiers to escort us out of the country. The four cars were also undamaged. On the way back, we passed through Hami, Anxi, Dunhuang, Yumen, Suzhou, Ganzhou, Liangzhou, Lanzhou, and reached Xi'an in Shaanxi, and returned to Nanjing on February 14 of this year via the Longhai Railway."</p>
<p>Eurasian Transportation: "As a result of this survey, the plan for the Huan-Xin Highway, that is (1) from Guihua via the Inner Mongolia Road to Hami, (2) from Xi'an via Lanzhou, Liangzhou, Ganzhou, Suzhou, Yumen, Dunhuang, Anxi to Hami. Both lines have original routes to follow and are easy to achieve. From Hami through Turpan, Korla, Kuqa to Aksu, on the border between China and Russia, there is a small section. If the Soviet Russian government approves it and connects it to the Soviet Russian highway, it can directly reach Europe. The Eurasian transportation line of thousands of years ago is expected to be restored and realized in the near future. In other words, if cars can pass from Shanghai to Guihua, then you can drive directly from Shanghai to Europe for sightseeing. As for the railway construction plan, it requires huge sums of money and considerable time, which is not easy to talk about," he said.</p>
<h3>Sven Hedin</h3>
<p>Soviet Russian Influence: The doctor finally said, "Before I set off, I was instructed by the Ministry of Railways that, in addition to surveying the highway, I should absolutely not involve myself in political issues. Therefore, everyone in Xinjiang was a friend. As for Soviet Russia's presence there, there is no special influence, only that trade is indeed progressing day by day. After returning to Beijing this time, I was treated with great courtesy by Chairman Lin, President Wang, and others, and I am extremely grateful," he said. The doctor is already 70 years old, his hair is gray, but his spirit is exceptionally full, and he lectured for nearly two hours without fatigue. His courageous and adventurous spirit is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<h3>Li Zeyi Went to Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Without Any Political Mission</p>
<p>Li Zeyi, a member of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, after meeting with Huang Fu in Shanghai, took the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru to Japan at 9:00 yesterday morning. According to his family, Mr. Li went to Japan to visit his sick son and will return to Shanghai in about two or three weeks without any political mission. One theory is that Mr. Li will take the opportunity to meet with Ambassador Chiang Tso-pin and Mr. Wang Chonghui.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Personnel to Investigate Nanyang Commerce</h3>
<p>Chen Chunpu and Others Are Scheduled to Sail on March 5th</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao's Views on Promoting Domestic Goods</p>
<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to promote trade in domestic goods in Nanyang and improve the lives of overseas Chinese, has specially commissioned Chen Chunpu, Liang Yugao, Zheng Lin, and others to go to Nanyang for investigation, in order to facilitate progress. After receiving the order, Chen Chunpu and others are scheduled to leave Shanghai on March 5th and sail abroad. Therefore, they sent a letter to Mr. Wu Zhihao, Standing Committee Member of the China National Products Production and Sales United Company, a few days ago, soliciting opinions from domestic goods manufacturers on promoting domestic goods in Nanyang for reference. The letter and Mr. Wu's opinions are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Chen Chunpu and Others Were Ordered to Investigate: The letter from Chen Chunpu and others to Wu Zhihao reads, "Respectfully, Chunpu and others have been dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Nanyang to investigate commercial affairs, inspect the affairs of consulates, and matters related to overseas Chinese. We will leave Shanghai on March 5th and sail abroad. Before leaving the country, we intend to collect opinions from domestic goods manufacturers on promoting domestic goods in Nanyang for reference, so that when we arrive in various parts of Nanyang, we can discuss solutions with consuls, chambers of commerce, and overseas Chinese merchants, and report the research and investigation results to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a basis for implementation and promotion. We respectfully ask you to convey this intention to the manufacturers, and we kindly ask you to collect the opinions of the manufacturers first and transfer them through your company. We will be grateful. Sincerely, Chen Chunpu, Liang Yugao, Zheng Lin, investigators of Nanyang commercial affairs dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's Reply Expressing His Opinion: After receiving the letter, Mr. Wu drafted six points of opinion in reply as follows: "Respectfully, I have received your letter and am delighted to learn that you are going to Nanyang to investigate commercial affairs on a mission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and inspect the affairs of the consulates. I hope that you will work hard in a foreign land and benefit the overseas Chinese. I am honored to hear this from afar and will not delay in my admiration. I am entrusted to collect opinions from domestic goods manufacturers on promoting domestic goods in Nanyang. In addition to forwarding this to the manufacturers as directed, I will draft opinions in the coming days and submit them to you through our company for reference. I would also like to briefly state my humble opinions for your selection. I believe that if we want to open up the Nanyang market today in order to build a solid foundation for the foreign trade of domestic goods, although the details are many and the fundamentals are different, we must not be biased. However, after weighing the importance and considering the urgency, the following matters are the most pressing needs of our domestic goods industry at present: (1) The establishment of commercial officers. Since the last century, international trade has become increasingly prosperous, and consulates in various countries have established commercial officers to understand local needs and study the psychology of residents, in order to develop trade in their own countries. Looking back at the places where our domestic products are sold abroad, the ports of Nanyang have always been the most prosperous. Six million of our overseas Chinese pioneers have been operating there. Although our government has established consulates in various Nanyang ports for diplomatic governance, it is still difficult to take into account the promotion of domestic goods due to the limited number of personnel and the complexity of affairs. If our domestic goods industry wants to develop in the Nanyang markets in the future, it is necessary to imitate the establishment of commercial officers with special responsibilities. (2) The opening of domestic goods exhibition halls. Although our domestic goods industry has indeed made progress day by day, we feel a lack of foreign exhibitions and publicity. The overseas Chinese in Nanyang have always been known for their enthusiasm for patriotism. However, being far away overseas, they often feel isolated from the industrial and commercial situation of the motherland, and domestic industries are even more unclear. Even if our overseas Chinese are eager to be patriotic, at a time when various countries are implementing commercial control policies, how can they not be disappointed in the motherland and be bewitched by foreign goods? Moreover, the Nanyang scholars do not have a sense of nationality among the various countries. Whoever's publicity is more effective, they will be their customers. The way of publicity should not be ignored. The so-called establishment of exhibition halls today is to collect domestic products for exhibition and use the publicity of real objects to encourage our overseas Chinese and local natives to use our domestic goods through continuous observation. The benefits to the promotion of domestic goods should not be insignificant. (3) The organization of domestic goods promotion agencies. The decline in trade in various parts of Nanyang has been caused by the exclusion of certain foreigners, which cannot be denied. However, the lack of adequate communication between producers and sellers is also a major reason. Since there is no specific organization to promote domestic goods in various parts of Nanyang, domestic factories are often hesitant and hesitant to move forward. Overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang also find it difficult to unify the steps of promotion due to the scattered transport of domestic goods to the south. Therefore, both in terms of main force and effectiveness, it is not enough to compete with the Japanese's planned trade. If we want to make up for this defect, we must unite the forces and jointly organize a large-scale domestic goods promotion agency in various ports of Nanyang. Our company can do its best in terms of its responsibilities. (4) The establishment of banks. There are many overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang, but it is not easy to find banks created by the Chinese themselves. This lacks the connection between fingers and arms in the development of the domestic goods industry. It is indeed difficult in practice to make the fragile domestic goods forces and maneuver in the field of international commercial warfare. If we want to develop trade in various parts of Nanyang, we should set up national banks and commercial banks in important areas of Nanyang, specializing in supporting the domestic goods industry as their business, and handling various types of mortgage remittance, exchange, and loan issuance. This can make both producers and sellers develop due to the proper financial adjustment. (5) The establishment of shipping. Transportation is a powerful tool for the smooth flow of goods. The reason why the relationship between supply and demand in today's society is so frequent is due to the development of transportation. Most of the goods transported from our country to Nanyang rely on foreign ships as their intermediaries. This not only results in a huge outflow of national funds, but also often involves unnecessary waste and trouble in terms of time and procedures. Because foreign ships always treat goods differently based on whether they are domestic or foreign. If they are domestic goods, they are given priority. If they are our country's goods, they are charged heavy freight. Nothing is more unfair than this. With the vast territory and abundant resources of our country, if we do not strive to reduce transportation costs, simplify procedures, and save time, domestic factories will be hesitant to move forward due to the cumbersome and heavy relationships. Water and land transportation has been implemented in various parts of our country. If the Ministry of Communications can have commercial ships sailing directly to Nanyang, whether it is in the border area or the interior, it can become more and more active due to the convenience of combined transportation. This is a great help in encouraging the foreign trade of domestic goods. As for plugging leaks, it is especially a matter of the future. (6) The holding of mutual inspections. Military tactics say, 'Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win every battle.' If we want to develop Nanyang, we must first have a comprehensive understanding of Nanyang society in order to deeply understand where Nanyang needs are and adapt to them. Therefore, we must unite domestic industrial and commercial leaders and industrial officials to conduct on-site inspections, either annually or every other year, so that our country's goods industry can have adequate guidance for exporting to Nanyang. As for the recent developments in our country's goods industry, in order to make Nanyang people aware of them, we should also invite Nanyang overseas Chinese organizations to continuously return to the country for inspection, so as to exchange perspectives and achieve the effect of mutual assistance. The above is only a discussion of the most important issues. As for the steps of implementation and methods, they all require you to discuss with local overseas Chinese organizations and research with local leaders, and make suggestions to the government for clear decision-making. I hope you will correct my humble opinions. Sincerely, Wu Zhihao to Mr. Chen Chunpu, Jie Yugao, Zheng Lin."</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Officially Denies Sending a Special Envoy to Japan</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Association Made a Special Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>All Aspects of the Japanese Telegram Are Considered Inaccurate</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, regarding the news reported in the Japanese telegram yesterday that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce had sent a representative to negotiate on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the China News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the association, at the Bankers Association yesterday. Mr. Lin absolutely denied all aspects of the news reported in the Japanese telegram. His statement is recorded below:</p>
<p>The News Reported in the Japanese Telegram: According to Mr. Lin, the Japanese telegram reported that the association had sent Jin Bofan, general manager of the International Enterprise Company, as an envoy to Japan to investigate concrete plans for Sino-Japanese cooperation, in order to express each other's sincerity and create materials for establishing a cooperation plan. The telegram also reported that Mr. Jin made a statement saying that the general industrial and commercial circles in China generally welcomed Japanese goods. After investigation, the association did not send this so-called special envoy to Japan. The manager of the International Enterprise Company is Chen Bofan, not Jin Bofan. Mr. Chen is an overseas Chinese who often resides in Kobe or Shanghai.</p>
<p>Absolutely Denies: Although the person is acquainted with me, he is not a special envoy sent by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce. However, before Mr. Chen went to Japan this time, there was a private contact. The industrial and commercial circles of our country wanted to know the inside story of the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation plan reported by the Japanese side. I also knew Mr. Hengzhu, the Japanese commercial officer who published this plan, so I introduced Chen to him and asked him to inquire about the truth on his behalf. As for Mr. Chen's statement in Japan that the industrial and commercial circles of our country welcomed Japanese goods, it is clear that the Japanese side is using this to promote themselves. Our country's industry and commerce do not welcome the import of any foreign goods.</p>
<h3>Shen Xin Company Sends Personnel to Japan for Investigation</h3>
<p>Mr. Hui and Mr. Zou Departed for Japan Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Rong Zongjing, General Manager of Shen Xin Textile Company, believes that the development of the Japanese textile industry is worthy of our country's reference. He specially sent Mr. Hui Zhidao, technician of the cloth factory of Shen Xin's Sixth Factory on Lan Road in this port, and Mr. Zou Ruzhui, director of the security department of the Second Factory on Yichang Road, to Japan for investigation. It is heard that Mr. Hui and Mr. Zou took the Nagasaki Maru and set off for Japan at 9:00 yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Magnate Xue Shou Xuan Sailed Abroad Yesterday</h3>
<p>Investigating the Silk Industries of European and American Countries for Reference</p>
<p>Xue Shou Xuan, a magnate in the silk industry in Wuxi, in view of the declining silk industry in our country and the lack of exports, has specially gone to Europe and the United States to investigate the silk industry. He came to Shanghai from Wuxi the day before yesterday and took the President Coolidge to the United States at 11:00 yesterday morning. According to Mr. Xue's statement to the Shen Shi News Agency reporter before his departure, Wuxi is the center of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and it controls the hub of the national silk industry. In recent years, silk exports have declined sharply, and the silk industry in Wuxi has suffered a setback. Silk factories have closed one after another, and the silkworm seed industry has also been greatly affected. The reasons for the sluggish silk exports are nothing more than poor quality and Japanese silk occupying our market. This time, he is going abroad to investigate the silk industry in the United States, France, Germany, Japan, and other countries, so that after returning to China, he can develop our silk industry for reference. The investigation period is set for eight months, and he is expected to return to China in November of this year.</p>
<h3>Match Tycoons from China, Japan, and the United States Will Hold a Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, Takikawa, and Others Will Gather in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Our Government Authorities Will Also Attend</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, in recent years, the match industry in our country has been quite vigorous, but because there are too many manufacturers, the goods produced are oversupplied. Recently, the Japanese government has decided to dump a large number of matches in China in order to maintain the survival of Japanese match factories and the livelihood of countless Japanese match workers. Our country's match manufacturers already feel that the domestic factories are oversupplied. If Japanese matches are dumped again, our side will inevitably fight back, and the domestic match industry will decline further. At the same time, the only American match company in China, the American Guang Match Company, has also been affected by our country's match industry, and sales have been sluggish. It intends to cooperate with our country. Therefore, the match manufacturers of the three countries have held a ceasefire cooperation meeting in Shanghai. According to the Hua Dong News Agency reporter's investigation yesterday morning, this matter can be realized in the near future. Our country's match manufacturers have been holding meetings for days and have thoroughly explored this matter. Recently, our side plans to send personnel to Japan to visit Mr. Takikawa, the match king of Japan, to discuss the implementation plan, and then invite Mr. Takikawa to Shanghai to discuss the ceasefire of matches and the production and sales cooperation of matches in the three countries with Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the match tycoon of South China, Mr. Zhang Xinwu, the match tycoon of North China, and the general manager of the American Guang Match Company, a match tycoon of American merchants in China. Since this matter is of great importance, our government authorities may send personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry to attend. According to relevant people in the match manufacturing industry in this city, the implementation of this measure can prevent the match manufacturers of the three countries from perishing together and can maintain their survival.</p>
<h3>The General Association of Marine Engineers Submits a Petition to the Ministry for Relief of Unemployed Seafarers</h3>
<p>Listing Eight Conditions of Request</p>
<p>Submitting this petition due to prolonged unemployment and lack of means of livelihood, electing representatives to present the petition. It is observed that China's maritime rights have been seized by others, the shipping industry is in decline, and the loss of rights is enormous. In recent years, the government has emphasized the shipping industry, established maritime administration agencies, and managed painstakingly with great effort. Indeed, this matter is of great importance, with thousands of threads to untangle, relating to national rights above and people's livelihoods below. It is appropriate to coordinate the overall situation and consider all parties, first determining the fundamental principles, and then proceeding step by step, in an orderly manner, to fully implement and maximize benefits, achieving the ultimate goal. Therefore, the legal system and decrees related to maritime administration, as well as various aspects of improvement and elimination, should be treated with absolute seriousness, to avoid any inappropriateness that leads to the phenomenon of square pegs in round holes, causing the pain of cutting one's feet to fit the shoes for the Chinese people. Currently, members of our association are affected by the encroachment of unlicensed marine engineers on their occupations, resulting in the unemployment of many, prolonged idleness, and unbearable hardship. We will explain the details and respectfully submit them to your ministry. According to international practice, ships of a country are generally staffed by nationals as navigation, marine engineering, and crew members, and foreigners are not allowed to be employed. Chinese merchants, bound by prejudice, often prefer to employ foreign crew members who enjoy extraterritorial rights, colluding with each other for mutual benefit, creating an unprecedented evil precedent in the world. The government has never strictly cracked down on this, allowing them to encroach on the occupations of Chinese people. For decades, this has become a situation that is too large to control. On the one hand, the government has conducted examinations for Chinese crew members, especially since June of the 22nd year (of the Republic), when Xu Zufan, as the chairman of the examination committee, initiated the practice of implementing examinations for crew members applying for certificates. After this, the service standards for crew members should be based on the existence or absence of certificates. Unexpectedly, there are still many who do not have certificates but are still employed. This not only has no solution for foreign crew members encroaching on occupations, but also has no solution for illegal Chinese crew members. The value of certificates is equal to zero, which is why the number of unemployed members of the association is increasing. Furthermore, according to the certificate regulations, crew members are not allowed to hold positions beyond the scope of the duties listed on their certificates. Your ministry had decided to ban this by the end of last year. The association fully expected this to be implemented at that time, giving the crew member community a chance to refresh itself. However, before the deadline, your ministry issued Instruction No. 6358 on December 15th, extending the deadline for another six months. The only reason given was that many crew members had difficulty coming to the ministry for examinations due to ship voyages, and this was done out of consideration for the situation below. Upon investigation, over-ranked crew members are those currently holding positions. Lowering their rank, at most, would be like changing a chief engineer to a first engineer, decreasing in succession. It would not result in unemployment. Your ministry should know that the situations of over-ranked crew members and unemployed crew members are vastly different. If it is truly out of consideration, then you should not only consider over-ranked crew members but also forget about unemployed crew members with certificates. You should differentiate between urgent and less urgent matters and handle them impartially. Because over-ranked employment is fundamentally illegal, now, instead of banning it, you are showing consideration, which, although nominally an extension, is actually an endorsement, adding another layer of protection to their illegal behavior. Therefore, according to the current method, the glimmer of hope that unemployed crew members have had for the past six months has been completely extinguished. Moreover, the extension will inevitably lead to malpractices, namely, shipowners taking advantage of loopholes, often making excuses to avoid employing formal crew members, precisely because they are taking advantage of their illegality, to recruit them at lower wages, clearly reducing expenses through illegal means. Your ministry had already issued Instruction No. 2789 on this situation in October of the 21st year, fully understanding the crux of the matter. Why is there a discrepancy between the past and the present, which is perplexing? (Omission) Some members of the association have been idle for as long as one or two years. Although we sent a letter to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau last year requesting them to handle unemployment registration, hoping they could find ways to place them, no one has been placed to this day, and the number of unemployed people continues to increase. After discussion at a meeting, it was decided that the situation was serious, and it was decided to nominate representatives to present a written petition. The conditions of the request are: (1) Please promptly issue a ministerial order to all competent maritime administration agencies, stating that from the date of the order, anyone who has not obtained a crew member certificate is not allowed to be employed in any position. Those who are already on board and whose employment began before the date of the ministerial order, and who have previously applied for employment registration with the Maritime Administration Bureau and obtained a seaman's manual stating the fact, shall be temporarily allowed to serve, but the shipping company shall be instructed to notify them to apply for examination within one month, or within two arrivals of their serving vessel at the port of Shanghai, and those who exceed the deadline shall be ordered to retire. (2) Crew members applying for examination shall be required to report for examination within one month, or within two arrivals of their serving vessel at the port of Shanghai, after receiving the approval from the ministry to go to the ministry for examination. Those who evade the deadline or fail to complete the examination shall be banned from serving. (3) Crew members engaged in examination shall be allowed to find qualified personnel to act on their behalf for the positions they left behind, and shall be allowed to retain their original positions. Those who pass the examination and are able to obtain certificates equivalent to their original positions shall be guaranteed reinstatement, and shipping companies shall not refuse. (4) Crew members who fail the current examination and are issued lower-level certificates shall not be allowed to serve beyond their level. (5) Those who serve beyond two levels shall be ordered to cease serving, and their existing qualifications shall only be calculated according to the level of the certificate they hold. (6) Crew members applying for examination who are willing to take a written test shall be allowed to choose the type of examination, regardless of Category A or B. Since they have undergone examination, their grades should be used to determine their ranking, and there should be no preconceived notions, using merchant marine schools as the standard for determining levels. The maritime profession is shared by all seafarers and should not be monopolized by one system or faction. Therefore, the regulation that those who do not come from merchant marine schools shall not be issued Category A certificates should be abolished to promote fairness. (7) The Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau's handling of crew member registration is improper, and there are complaints from the outside world. Those with verifiable facts, such as chief engineers serving without certificates, impersonating others, and not applying for examinations without certificates, who do not meet the statutory qualifications, are not noticed by the bureau. It is not known why this is the case. Therefore, as a thorough solution, all matters related to the employment, dismissal, and change of serving vessels of marine engineers in Shanghai should be determined to be handled by the association on behalf of the applicant, so as to supervise each other and provide relief. (8) The provisions of Articles 8 and 9 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations for Crew Member Examination shall be amended. They stipulate that chief engineers who hold certificates must continue to serve for more than five years before they can be exempted from examining other marine engineers, and other marine engineers must hold the positions stated on their certificates for more than one year before they are allowed to undergo original-level examinations. At present, foreign crew members and illegal Chinese crew members are not prohibited and are still allowed to serve, clearly infringing on the rights of crew members who have already obtained certificates. The government is not only unable to protect them, but also imposes harsh restrictions on them. Therefore, for the sake of unemployed crew members, they have already felt the pain of life, and after several years, even if they do not fill the trenches or die from cold and hunger, their original qualifications will have already disappeared and they will no longer have the opportunity to serve as crew members. This is a suicidal policy and should be abolished. The above eight items, in light of the current situation, are sufficient to show that the cause of crew member unemployment is not due to a natural trend, but rather to the failure of maritime administration to seize the opportunity. Therefore, the order allowing over-ranked employment is a step towards disaster, and it must not be extended again after the deadline. We believe that your ministry is in charge of transportation, and if you do not resolve the issue of crew member unemployment as soon as possible, hidden dangers will lie dormant, and once they erupt, the promotion of China's shipping industry in the future may not be immune to its constraints. Looking to the future, we are particularly fearful. Therefore, in accordance with the discussion and decision method, together with the roster of unemployed members, we have prepared a written petition and personally ask that your Excellency accept the situation below and grant the requested items to be implemented as soon as possible, so as to provide relief and demonstrate assistance. We respectfully submit this to the Ministry of Transportation, earnestly hoping for your approval and compliance.</p>

<h3>Xingye Trust Society Continues to Build Urban Housing</h3>
<p>Styles are Divided into Types A and B</p>
<p>Sales Price Can be Paid in Installments</p>
<p>Since the central urban area has been actively developed by the municipal government and all sectors, it is now splendidly complete, and public buildings will also be completed one after another. In order to prosper the central urban area and meet the needs, the Shanghai Xingye Trust Society built dozens of houses between Minfu Road and Shiguang Road last year, which were sold in installments and were very popular among people from all walks of life. They were sold out soon. Last winter, the society added a small vegetable market and urban houses for rent, and opened small-scale department stores and daily necessities stores, which were even more convenient for the residents. Now, the society is building a second batch of two types of houses between Zhayin Road and Minfu Road in the central urban area. Type A occupies an area of about 1.5 mu, and Type B occupies about 1 mu. The houses are newly and thoughtfully designed, sturdily and beautifully built, and equipped with complete water, electricity, and sanitation facilities. There is space left outside the house for planting flowers and trees, surrounded by bamboo fences, which are elegant and unique. The sales price is low. Type A is 20,000 yuan per house, and Type B is 16,000 yuan, and it can be paid in installments. Construction began in December last year and will be completed by the end of July this year. The society has a simple brochure with detailed information on the style, size, and dimensions of the houses, as well as installment payment tables, for people from all walks of life to request.</p>
<h3>Four Gambling Dens Busted in the Public Concession</h3>

<p>The Public Concession police, between 12:00 AM and 1:30 AM yesterday morning, busted four gambling dens within their jurisdiction, arresting a total of 111 male and female gamblers. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them separately for gambling and running a gambling house. After questioning each case by Judge Zhan Liangce, the bosses and gamblers who profited from commissions were severely punished. The details of each case are recorded below: (1) Huazong Detective You A'gen, detectives Pang Ruiqing and Wang Yingjie of the Old Gate Police Station, at 1:50 AM yesterday morning, arrested Wu Jindao and Wu Longchang, who were gathering to gamble and taking commissions, and gamblers Wang A'gou, Lin A'fu, Li Genshou, Wang A'gen, Yin Baogen, etc., a total of 30 people, in room 327 of the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road, and confiscated gambling equipment, Pai Gow, three sets of playing cards, a complete set of smoking paraphernalia, and gambling money, etc. (2) Hua Detectives Yao Jiagui and Xue Ziwen of the Old Gate Police Station, in room 201 of the Tianran Hotel at the intersection of Zhifu Road and Guizhou Road, arrested gambling boss Wang Jinsheng and gamblers Wu Shuchang, Xu Rusong, etc., a total of 27 people, and confiscated gambling equipment and gambling money.

Another person, Cao Changxing, was also detained for another case. Therefore, Judge Zhan Liangce ordered them to be returned to prison for the police to investigate and verify.</p>
<h3>Young American House Servant Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>The Meaning of Eight Characters in the Suicide Note is Unclear</p>
<p>Chen Shiming, a young man from Yangzhou, 18 years old, was introduced to work as a house servant at the residence of an American named Ross (transliteration) in room 31 of the Gao Ta Apartment, No. 1333 Xiafei Road, French Concession, last August, with a monthly salary of 10 yuan. His father, Chen Lihai, 43 years old, is currently working in a brothel in Tianjin. His mother, Chen Cui's, 37 years old, is currently working as an amah in a Westerner's house at No. 1590 Xiafei Road. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Shiming, alone in his employer Ross's room, for some unknown reason, suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. He first wrote a note with a pencil on a piece of paper, and then opened the cupboard and took out a six-round large-caliber revolver that his employer had prepared. Standing in front of the cupboard, he fired at his chest. The bullet pierced his chest and exited from his back, also shattering the glass of the dressing mirror placed against the wall behind him, also creating a hole. After being injured, Shiming fell to the ground and died. The other servants, Zhu Ziwen (30 years old, from Yangzhou) and the wet nurse, Udu Wengu (transliteration, 32-year-old Russian woman), heard the sound and entered the room to check. The deceased's body was covered in blood, flowing from the wound. They were greatly frightened and immediately called the employer, American Ross, to come and report to the French police, who sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. A piece of paper was found on a small table next to the body, with eight characters written on it ("字肝字精、不關傍人"), the meaning of which was unclear. They immediately took photos and moved the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch of the mortuary for examination, waiting for a report to the Second Special District Court today to send personnel to examine it. The deceased's mother, Chen Cui's, received the news and rushed to the mortuary, weeping over the body. She also claimed that her son often joked with his fellow servants, such as the head servant, and that he must have been playing with the gun and accidentally shot himself, and asked the police to investigate.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Opening of the Trial of the Hua Zhongchu Case of a Spring Dream of Victory, Generosity, and Heroism</h3>
<p>The Audience Seats Were Filled With Prostitutes</p>
<p>Hua et al. Admitted to All Accusations</p>
<p>—The Two Prostitutes Each Paid 500 Yuan Deposit, the Rest Were Returned to Prison—</p>
<p>Hua Zhongchu, Ding Chengfu, Pan Ruilin, and Zhu Minggui, trainees at the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank on Henan Road, jointly exchanged 30,000 yuan of banknotes with blank paper and 12,305 yuan of ten-yuan banknotes with five-yuan banknotes. Hua also absconded to Hong Kong with the prostitutes Lao Er (Yan Caizhen) and Lao San (Wu Zhihua) from the Yinghong brothel in Huile Lane. The police successively captured and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, continued the interrogation in the First Criminal Court. The China Agricultural and Industrial Bank hired lawyer Ma Shouhua to represent them in court. The defendants hired lawyers Wu Linkun, Wang Peiyuan, Lu Shanyu, Wu Qinsun, Chen Guocai, and Li Mo to defend them. The audience seats were filled, mostly with</p>
<p>Brothel Prostitutes First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, and based on Article 357 of the Criminal Law, the crime of business encroachment, he prosecuted Ding Chengfu, Pan Ruilin, Zhu Minggui, Hua Zhongchu, and the two courtesans of Yinghong. Ding Chengfu knew that Hua Zhongchu had fled to Hong Kong but secretly did not announce it, committing the crime of harboring a criminal under Article 174 of the Criminal Law, and was thus prosecuted for an additional charge. Hua Zhongchu and Ding Chengfu each gave the two prostitutes 260 yuan when they left Shanghai with Hua, etc. Hua Zhongchu confessed, in response, that the cause of this case was that Zhu Minggui used 200 yuan of the 1,000 yuan deposited by his relative, which he could not make up. He discussed it with Pan Ruilin, who told me to take 200 yuan from the banknote bundle and give it to Zhu. From then on, he, Pan, Zhu, and Ding Chengfu traveled together, often going to the dog racing track and the Jai Alai court, and the money they lost was</p>
<p>Stolen Public Funds Later, fearing that the matter would be exposed, Pan instructed me to exchange the China Industrial Bank's five-yuan banknotes for Agricultural and Industrial Bank's ten-yuan banknotes. Using this method, they stole approximately 12,000 yuan in banknotes, of which 5,000 yuan was lost by mistake, actually only about 7,000 yuan. I used 2,500 yuan, Ding used 400 yuan, Zhu used 1,800 yuan, and Pan used 2,700 yuan. Of which, about 300 or 400 yuan was used for Yinghong. Then, Pan said that this method was very dangerous and that it would be better to exchange the banknotes with blank paper and then run away. Then the four of us discussed it in room 626 of the Yangtze Hotel and room 209 of the Xinxin Hotel, cutting the blank paper into the shape of banknotes and exchanging them for banknotes. When we discussed it, I did not want to do this</p>
<p>And Planned to Commit Suicide Ding Chengfu dissuaded me. After I obtained 30,000 yuan in banknotes, I gave Ding Chengfu 1,500 yuan, and Pan and Zhu 200 yuan each, etc. Ding Chengfu confessed that he had taken more than 1,900 yuan from Pan and Hua successively. On the point of whether he knew and participated in the fraud, he seemed to admit it but did not admit it, and his confession was vague. Zhu Minggui admitted to using the money, but also evaded that he had never participated in the discussion. Pan Ruilin directly admitted the methods he taught Hua to steal money, but claimed that he did not know when Hua exchanged the banknotes with blank paper. The two prostitutes confessed that Cai and Ding each gave them 260 yuan when they left Shanghai, which was true, but it was for buying clothes and other things. Police lawyer Wang immediately presented the gold rings, gold bracelets, gold lockets, gold chains, watches, and other items found in the two prostitutes' possession, saying that these gold ornaments were also bought with the stolen money, but the two courtesans denied it, saying that they were gifts from a guest named Chen. Judge Qian, with the facts clear, ordered a postponement to Thursday morning to begin the debate. The two prostitutes were allowed to pay a deposit of 500 yuan each, and the rest were returned to prison.</p>
<h3>The Murderer Who Stabbed the Owner of the Taoshan Dance Hall Was Yesterday Escorted to Nagasaki</h3>
<p>Prosecuted for Causing Death by Injury</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese newspaper "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reported that the case of Mr. Tokuno Kosaburo, the owner of a Japanese restaurant, stabbing Mr. Akashi, the owner of the Taoshan Dance Hall on Yokohama Bridge, Kunshan Road, during last year's election of members of the Japanese Resident Association, has been preliminarily investigated by the Japanese Consulate and prosecuted for causing death by injury. The criminal was escorted to Japan by Patrol Chief Sato, the patrol chief of the Japanese Consulate, on the Nagasaki Maru on the 26th.</p>
<h3>A Woman Who Lost Her Way Was Taken Advantage of by Bad Guys</h3>
<p>The Evils of Society and the Overflowing of Human Desires</p>
<p>Zheng Xudong Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Wang Wanghao (18 years old), a woman from Guangdong, is beautiful. Recently, she came to Shanghai from Singapore with her aunt Wang Yulian and stayed in room 11 of the Delin Apartment on North Sichuan Road, looking for relatives. At about 8:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, the woman went out alone to wander around Kunshan Road and lost her way back to the apartment. Zheng Xudong (23 years old), a Yongbo native residing at No. 95 Pingliang Road, a copper craftsman, was a lecherous person. He and his friend Zhu Lianghong passed by. The woman asked him where the Delin Apartment was and did not know the way. Zheng saw that the woman was beautiful and young, and suddenly had lustful thoughts. He tricked her into the Changan Hotel at No. 29 Pingliang Road, opened room 21, and raped the woman by force. She stayed there for two nights and could not escape, so she had to listen to him. The day before yesterday, a certain person who repaired the lights in the hotel found that Zheng Xudong and the woman had different accents and determined that she had been abducted. He secretly reported to the Hongkou Police Station. The police chief sent Hua Detective Feng Qi and a Western detective to investigate. Zheng happened to be out. After questioning the woman, they learned the whole story, waited in the room, and arrested Zheng when he arrived, taking him to the police station for detention. The woman was sent back to her aunt Wang Yulian's place in the Delin Apartment. Yesterday morning, the police sent Zheng Xudong to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Because the case involved morality, spectators were prohibited from attending the hearing. After questioning by Judge Wu Zehan, the defendant was ordered to be returned to prison for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in Shanghai for Several Days</h3>
<p>Recently, the climate in the city has been irregular, which has a great impact on health. Yesterday morning, heavy fog filled the air again. Ships in the Huangpu River were slow to navigate to avoid accidents. Vehicles on the road also had to reduce their speed. The fog did not dissipate until about 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Pacific Association Luncheon</h3>
<p>The Pacific Association held a luncheon at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road on the seventh floor at 12:30 PM yesterday. A total of 98 male and female members attended. Among the Chinese attendees were Li Denghui, Wu Liande, Guo Bingwen, etc., six or seven people. After the meal, Italian journalist and explorer Dr. Orlandi also gave a lecture on his travels through northwestern Xinjiang and Mongolia. He spoke in English and described his experiences along the way from Sichuan to Mongolia and Xinjiang. In addition to praising the mountains and rivers of these places, he also criticized the local customs, etc. The meeting adjourned at about 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Request from the Yandui (Tobacco and Opium) Association Office for Temporary Exemption from License Fee Increase</h3>
<p>Due to Sluggish Market and Declining Business in All Sectors</p>
<p>The Nanshi (South City) office of the Shanghai Yandui Industry Association, due to the fact that fifteen members, including Wan Mao Xiang Yandui Store, etc., have already paid for licenses, and now need to increase them again in the spring, previously submitted a request to the Municipal Finance Bureau to levy fees according to the original amount. As of today, no approval has been received. They will submit another document requesting exemption from the increase. The original submission is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submission is made to urge the dispatch of personnel for re-inspection, to order the office to maintain the original amount, and to exempt from increase. Hoping for your review and instructions.</p>
<p>The association previously submitted a request in mid-January regarding the fifteen members, including Wan Mao Xiang, etc., who need to increase their license fees in the spring. More than a month has passed, and no approval has been received. The members have repeatedly urged the association to inquire about how to proceed. The association dares not speculate. However, the market is sluggish, and all industries are declining. The consumption of tobacco and alcohol is even more difficult to develop. You, sir, have been in Shanghai for a long time and can understand the situation. It is hoped that you will be considerate and maintain the original amount, temporarily exempting from the increase. We respectfully submit another document requesting that you review and quickly dispatch personnel for re-inspection, ordering the office to maintain the original amount, exempting from the increase. We also request instructions to be issued so that we can comply with them, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Agricultural Conference Closed Last Night</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bank held a business conference of the Agricultural Department from the 10th of this month. All branches and agricultural personnel from across the country participated. Agricultural specialists were also invited to give lectures. The business direction for this year was decided, and the conference closed last night. General Manager Chen Guangfu and Deputy General Manager Zou Bingwen hosted a banquet for all branch and agricultural personnel at the Bankers' Association Club on Hong Kong Road. No ceremony was held. It is reported that representatives from various regions will leave Shanghai starting today.</p>
<h3>Longzhang Paper Mill's Machine Transformation a Great Success</h3>
<p>Benefiting Culture and Saving Outflow of Capital</p>
<p>The Longzhang Machine Paper Mill on Longhua Road in Shanghai was established in the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty, and has been in operation for thirty years. Initially, it was a joint venture between the government and merchants, equipped with two American thin paper long-net paper-making machines. Japanese engineers and all important technical personnel were hired. Due to mismanagement, it suffered significant losses and was once suspended. Subsequently, Pang Laichen, a wealthy merchant from Nanxun, took over and transformed it into a commercial enterprise. He dismissed the Japanese personnel and reduced expenses. Since then, the operation has been smooth.</p>
<p>The factory has historically specialized in producing various types of "Yanglian Shi" (foreign stationery), which were popular throughout the country. After the September 18th Incident, the Northeast was lost, and sales were greatly affected, decreasing by about one-third each year. The current General Manager, Zhang Rangzhi, recognizing this situation, focused on also manufacturing foreign paper to prevent the overproduction of "Yanglian Shi" and to benefit the cultural industry significantly. The foreign paper used by the domestic printing industry was mostly imported, resulting in a huge outflow of capital each year. Paper manufacturers should take responsibility for reversing this trend. Therefore, an engineer was hired to the factory to try making "Daolin" (woodfree) paper, but the results were not entirely satisfactory. A Shanghai foreign firm was then requested to design and transform the paper-making machine to achieve the goal. The foreign firm drew up plans for transforming the machine, asking for more than ten thousand yuan, but the price was not agreed upon, so it was temporarily abandoned.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in May of last year (1934), Xue Liufeng, Zhang Linquan, Mu Shisong, Liu Zhenhua, etc., were hired to the factory to design and prototype. Starting in November, one part of the paper-making machine was dismantled and reassembled. On February 20th of this year, it began operating, and the results of trial production of gray wrapping paper and Mao Yuen (month calendar) paper were excellent. The factory owner, Pang Laichen, personally inspected the factory the next day and expressed great satisfaction. The transformation of the paper-making machine, the addition of machine parts, and labor and materials cost a total of more than ten thousand yuan, only one-tenth of the price quoted by the foreign firm. The cost was minimal, and the success was great. Even better, after the transformation, the machine can still produce "Yanglian Shi," maintaining the original purpose of the factory.</p>
<p>It is believed that this factory is the first in the country to independently design and install machines to manufacture foreign paper. Who says that China has no talent? Compared to Westerners, it is even better. The factory is currently preparing to produce various weights of Daolin paper, kraft paper, and colored cover paper samples to be distributed to major bookstores and printing factories in the country, requesting criticism and encouraging the use of domestic products to stem the outflow of capital. They also plan to establish a chemical testing laboratory to study foreign paper to meet social needs.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Upgrades Fire Hydrants</h3>
<p>New Hydrants with Three Outlets</p>
<p>One Hydrant Installed Every 250 Feet</p>
<p>The Director of the Fire Department of the Public Works Department recently agreed with the Water Company to quickly upgrade the old-style hydrants on the streets, which only have one outlet, to new-style hydrants with three outlets. A total of 150 hydrants should be upgraded and installed each year so that there will be one new-style hydrant every 250 feet of road surface, and two hydrants at intersections. The supply and installation of these hydrants will be the responsibility of the company, and the ongoing maintenance costs, estimated at 70,000 yuan per year, will still be borne by the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>It has also been found that 1,038 private fire-fighting facilities are connected to the company's water pipes. The owners are responsible for the timely repair and painting. The Public Works Department has now decided that the Fire Department will strictly inspect them. The company and the owners will directly handle the repairs and costs.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Response to Wanyou Wenku (Complete Library) Subscribers</h3>
<p>Exceeding the Original Print Run of the First Phase</p>
<p>The second collection of Wanyou Wenku, published by the Commercial Press, ended its subscription period at the end of 1934. In addition to orders from libraries, schools, and individuals from all over the country, the education departments of Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Shandong, and other provinces have also ordered dozens to one or two hundred copies. The original print run of the books has already been nearly exhausted. Subsequently, in response to requests from various parties, a new installment payment and group sales subscription method was established on February 1, 1935. Purchasers can weigh their needs and urgency, or pay in installments, or select and purchase in groups according to their preferences, which is very convenient. Since the announcement of this method, new subscribers have been very enthusiastic. It is estimated that the books in the first phase, which will be published in March, will not be sufficient to meet demand. If reservations are made later, it will take two months to receive the books when the first edition is sold out. Those who order according to the new method should do so as early as possible. It is also heard that there are preferential methods for ordering the second collection of Wanyou Wenku if the first collection is also ordered at the same time.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Woman Sues University Student</h3>
<p>University Student Says Plaintiff is a Former Prostitute</p>
<p>Sun Shanfu, a university student residing at No. 50 Wende Lane, Hardoon Road, has recently been sued in the First Special Court by Wang Yulan, a woman from Tianjin, for violating public morals and misappropriating ornaments. He has already been summoned once, but because the defendant did not arrive, he was instructed to reschedule. This newspaper has already reported on this situation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu continued to summon the defendant, who arrived with his agent, lawyer Chao Kun.</p>
<p>The defendant, Sun Shanfu, stated that the charges of misappropriation and violation of public morals brought by Wang Yulan are not true. He met Wang in the New World (entertainment district) the year before last, and they became intimate. He then learned that Wang was a prostitute from the North, named Lu Lanchun, who was known as Chen Yumei Lao Wu at the Shantou Road (another name) establishment. After Mid-Autumn Festival, she moved to Rongfang in Fuxiang Lane and Yanchun in Sanyuan Lane on Guangxi Road. From then on, they became acquainted, and he spent no less than 1,800 yuan on her. They had private meetings in the Nanjing Hotel and had sexual relations. However, he did not rent a house and live with her. He did visit the Fuzhi Lane and Pingle Lane addresses that she rented, but he never discussed marriage with her, and he never misappropriated any ornaments.</p>
<p>Last July, the plaintiff's younger brother wanted to go out for a wedding and temporarily borrowed a pocket watch and watch chain from him. Later, when he asked for them back, he only returned the watch. As for the watch chain, he demanded that he write an IOU for 20,000 yuan before he would return it. Later, his father found out about this fleeting affair and strictly disciplined him, forbidding him from taking another step into the red-light district. Since he had run out of money and was an old flame, they went their separate ways. This is the true course of events.</p>
<p>Chen Fengming, the second landlord of No. 5 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, testified that the defendant and the plaintiff came together to rent the house on April 26th last year. He did not know what kind of relationship they had. A female witness, Zhou Xu, testified that the plaintiff was formerly a prostitute at the Lu Lanchun brothel, known as Chen Yumei Lao Wu. The defendant would come to play and call for her services.</p>
<p>Finally, the lawyers from both sides began their closing arguments. Judge Liu announced that the verdict in the case would be announced at 2 p.m. on the 28th.</p>

<h3>Jailed for Buying a Diamond Ring</h3>
<p>Yin Cunfu Sues the Wife of a Deceased Friend</p>
<p>Kuang Cheng, the second daughter-in-law of Kuang Zhongmou, a wealthy Wuxi merchant and owner of the Cheng Huang Miao market in this city (also known as Cheng Meifang), was once involved in a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court for colluding with her mother, Cheng Xu, to defraud Yin Cunfu of two diamond rings worth a significant amount. Cheng Xu was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison. Kuang Cheng Meifang failed to appear in court, and the case was suspended.</p>
<p>The cause of this case is as follows: Yin Cunfu, a resident of No. 4 Xilin Hou Road, Ximenwai, has been engaged in real estate for many years. His business has been smooth, and he has accumulated a lot of wealth. In November of last year, Cheng Xu, a widow from Shanghai residing at No. 20 Dahua Lane, Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, went to Yin Cunfu's house with her daughter, Kuang Cheng Meifang, and purchased two diamond rings from Yin, agreeing to a price of 2,900 yuan. She paid 1,000 yuan, leaving 1,900 yuan unpaid. Subsequently, the mother and daughter disappeared. Yin Cunfu, in desperation, hired a lawyer to sue Cheng Xu and Cheng Meifang in the Second Special District Court for fraud. As a result, Cheng Xu was sentenced to two years in prison. The second defendant, Kuang Cheng Meifang, was under the jurisdiction of Nanshi, so the plaintiff was ordered to file a separate lawsuit with the Nanshi District Court according to the law.</p>
<p>After receiving the complaint, the court ordered the accused to be interrogated. However, Kuang Cheng Meifang refused to appear in court, and the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Judge Chen Jingze specially opened the 13th courtroom for trial. The plaintiff, Yin Cunfu, and his private prosecution agent lawyer appeared in court. The first defendant, Cheng Xu, had previously been transferred from the Second Special District Court and detained. The judge ascended the bench and ordered the plaintiff, Yin Cunfu, to the dock.</p>
<p>After hearing the testimony, he said, "I am 44 years old. Last winter, in November, Cheng Xu came to my house with her daughter, Kuang Cheng Meifang, to buy diamond rings."</p>
<p>The judge asked, "How did they know you had these diamond rings at home?"</p>
<p>He replied, "Cheng Xu's husband was a friend of mine when he was alive, and we had a good relationship, so they knew."</p>
<p>The judge asked, "How many diamond rings did they buy?"</p>
<p>He replied, "In early November, Cheng Xu came to my house alone and bought a diamond ring for 1,600 yuan. About ten days later, Cheng Xu came to my house again with her daughter, Cheng Meifang, but I was out on business and didn't see them. Soon after, the mother and daughter came again, but I still didn't see them. The last time was on November 19th, when I finally met them. At that time, Cheng Xu paid 1,000 yuan, and Kuang Cheng Meifang bought another diamond ring from me. I thought she was the daughter-in-law of a wealthy merchant and had no other concerns, so I let her take it. Later, I learned that they had pawned it for cash."</p>
<p>The judge asked, "Then the pawn ticket was returned to you?"</p>
<p>He replied, "The pawn ticket was only returned to my house yesterday."</p>
<p>The judge asked, "How much was it pawned for?"</p>
<p>He replied, "It was pawned for 800 yuan."</p>
<p>After hearing the testimony, the judge ordered Cheng Xu to be brought to the dock. She was 44 years old.</p>
<p>The judge asked, "Why did you buy diamond rings from Yin and pawn them?"</p>
<p>She replied, "I took the diamond rings to Bao Cheng Silver Shop to exchange for money, but I didn't expect the owner, Cao Junqing, to detain them. I had previously owed Cao Junqing 800 yuan, so the money from Yin Cunfu's house could not be delivered. However, this matter has nothing to do with my daughter, Cheng Meifang. I am willing to repay the debt and request leniency."</p>
<p>Finally, Kuang Cheng Meifang testified that she was 18 years old and lived at No. 88 Hejia Lane, Shangwen Road. She did not go to Yin's house with her mother. She claimed that at that time, her husband was recuperating in Hangzhou, so she was taking care of him in Hangzhou. If the court did not believe her, she had a hospital certificate to prove it.</p>
<p>The judge examined the certificate and then invited prosecutor Wu Deying to the court to present his arguments.</p>
<p>After a long debate, the plaintiff's private prosecution agent lawyer requested to pursue the private prosecution portion, stating that 1,000 yuan had been received for the first diamond ring worth 1,600 yuan, leaving 600 yuan unpaid. The pawn ticket for the second diamond ring had been recovered, and the pawn amount was 800 yuan, plus 100 yuan in interest, totaling 900 yuan. Adding the previous 600 yuan owed, the total amount to be recovered was 1,500 yuan. He requested that Cheng Xu and Kuang Cheng Meifang be jointly responsible for the payment.</p>
<p>After hearing the testimony, the judge considered the case to be clear and declared the hearing closed. The verdict was scheduled to be announced at 4 p.m. on the 28th of this month. Cheng Xu was returned to custody, and Kuang Cheng Meifang was ordered to provide a reliable shop as surety for 1,500 yuan. Without surety, she would be taken into custody.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Convenes Meeting of Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Seeking Ways to Promote Domestic Bleached Cloth in Southeast Asia Meeting Scheduled for 3 PM on the 28th</p>
<p>There are many overseas Chinese living in Southeast Asia, and the annual consumption is significant. They are always mindful of their motherland and want to buy domestic products for their daily needs. Recently, the Ministry of Industry received news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the sales of domestic bleached cloth in Java are considerable. The Bureau has decided to convene a meeting of more than 30 dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai, including Hongzhang, Qiming, Guangzhong, Lixin, Datong, Renfeng, and Dagong, at the Bureau at 3 p.m. on February 28th to discuss ways to promote domestic bleached cloth in Southeast Asia. The official letter from the Bureau to the factories is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>The Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Industry to discuss ways to reduce the cost of bleached cloth exported from China to Southeast Asia to facilitate promotion. A meeting of related businesses in Shanghai will be held at the Bureau at 3 p.m. on February 28th to discuss everything. We hope that your factory will send responsible personnel to the Bureau for the meeting. We look forward to your participation.</p>
<h3>Observations on Foreign Banks Raising Interest Rates and Increasing the Issuance of Banknotes</h3>
<p>China News Agency reports that foreign banks in Shanghai are recently issuing large amounts of banknotes and raising interest rates to absorb Chinese silver in order to absorb Chinese silver. A reporter from China News Agency interviewed Lin Kanghou, secretary of the Shanghai Banking Association, and economic expert Li Quanshi to find out the truth. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Lin's Opinion: According to Lin, the issuance of banknotes by foreign banks in China is a major loss of our country's financial sovereignty. It was only after the successive establishment of the China Traffic and Communications Banks that the Chinese people had great confidence in domestic banknotes. This is because the issuing Chinese banks have their ten percent reserve funds supervised and managed by the government. As for the issuance of banknotes by foreign banks in China, the amount was the largest during Yuan Shikai's era. In recent years, the Chinese people have used their own funds to provide foreign investment for enterprises, which is deeply unjust. As for Chinese banks, they hope that the government will handle this matter properly.</p>
<p>Li's Remarks: According to economic expert Dr. Li Quanshi, foreign banks want to issue a large number of banknotes and increase interest rates to absorb Chinese silver. The only effective way to increase the issuance of banknotes is to immediately exchange all foreign bank banknotes for cash, whether they are in the hands of the public or Chinese banks. As for foreign banks increasing interest rates to absorb Chinese silver, it is due to the recent awakening of the Chinese people. Recently, foreign banks have been shipping silver out of the country, and their reserves have been sharply reduced. Depositors are withdrawing their funds one after another. During the warlord era, some Chinese people even voluntarily deposited their funds in foreign banks without receiving interest. Now, the increase in interest rates is clearly a prelude to the decline caused by the sharp decline in depositors.</p>
<p>Foreign Interpretation: New Voice News Agency reports that the case of foreign banks increasing the issuance of banknotes and raising interest rates has attracted much attention. A reporter from New Voice News Agency learned from foreign banking circles that before the final accounts of 1934, British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank, in view of the tight money supply in Shanghai, reissued the banknotes that had been gradually collected. After the final accounts, Chinese money shops, etc., because of the issuance of banknotes from China Traffic and Communications Banks, etc., immediately exchanged the foreign bank banknotes they received the next day. Moreover, the Chinese people welcomed the use of Chinese bank banknotes, so now, in view of the impropriety of the method, they have gradually withdrawn them. As for the increase in interest rates for depositors, it is due to price factors. Last year, the annual interest rate for depositors was about 1.75%. This year, the annual interest rate for HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and other three banks has been changed to 5%. As for the rumors that the Shanghai Banking Association has firmly requested a ban, according to Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Association, there is no such thing.</p>
<h3>Doihara Departed for Hong Kong This Morning</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Doihara, the special agent chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army, departed from Shanghai for Hong Kong at 1 a.m. this morning, accompanied by Koyama Sadaji, advisor to the South Manchuria Railway, aboard the Japanese ship Asaguni Maru. Doihara and his party boarded the ship at 11 p.m. last night. Sugisaka, commander of the 11th Company of the Japanese Naval Landing Force in Shanghai, and others came to the dock to see them off. It is planned that after arriving in Hong Kong, they will travel to Guangzhou and other places, staying in Hong Kong and Guangdong for a week before returning to the country via Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Shanghai Branch to Launch Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>Starting on March 1st, Goal is 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>To Support Social Welfare Undertakings</p>
<p>The Salvation Army Shanghai Branch has decided to launch a fundraising campaign starting on March 1st, with a goal of 30,000 yuan to support various social and charitable works. The name of the Salvation Army is not yet familiar to the Chinese people, who think that it only helps foreigners. In fact, it takes care of both Chinese and foreigners, and in places like Beijing and Shenyang, it serves the Chinese people completely. In Shanghai, the Released Prisoners' Aid Society on Huade Road was founded by the Army and has achieved remarkable results. The majority of those it helps are Chinese. The Huade Road Prison is the largest in the world. Last year, Salvation Army officers received 11,200 released prisoners, about one-tenth of whom were given relief by the Army, such as clothing, medicine, food, and assistance to return to their hometowns. Last year, 499 Chinese released prisoners were assisted in returning to their hometowns, and 140 of them were helped by the Salvation Army to find work. As for foreign released prisoners who received assistance, there were 44 throughout the year. Sometimes the families of the prisoners are also assisted by the Association.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army has been in China for 18 years. It started with only six people in Beijing. Today, the entire army has reached 263 people, most of whom are Chinese. There are 90 meeting places throughout the country. Donations can be sent to the Army Headquarters at No. 422 North Suzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Commercial Bank Orders Printing of New Banknotes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th: The Agricultural and Commercial Bank, because most of the banknotes it has issued are old and damaged, has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to order the printing of new banknotes and to increase the amount of issuance. The Ministry of Finance has approved the ordering of 20 million yuan of new banknotes and has also approved an increase in the issuance amount of 2 million yuan.</p>

<h3>General Overview of the Drought Disaster Relief Efforts in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng's Report After Inspecting and Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng, the executive director of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, along with inspector Qiao Baoyuan and others, inspected disaster relief efforts in various counties of Jiangsu. He returned to Shanghai yesterday and reported that the disaster situation in Liyang, Lishui, Gaochun, and other counties is extremely severe. In the disaster areas they visited, many able-bodied men had fled to other places, leaving behind the elderly, weak, and disabled in desolate rooms, sighing to each other. Upon inspection of the houses, not only were there no savings, but the bottom of the cooking pots were covered in dust. When asked, they burst into tears. In Liyang County alone, no fewer than several thousand people have been sold as children to Wuxi and Shanghai. Young girls are sold for a mere three or five yuan. In Jiangpu, many have committed suicide due to hunger. Old women in Jurong, unable to bear the hunger, have resorted to running onto the road, hoping to be crushed by cars. The food of the disaster victims consists mostly of powdered weathered stone (commonly known as Guanyin powder), powdered elm bark, and buckwheat husks. In Gaochun and Lishui, many have died from intestinal blockages caused by eating weathered stone, and from poisoning caused by eating elm bark with sugar. In other counties, such as Jintan, filling their stomachs with bran and grass roots is considered a delicacy. Such a severe disaster is unprecedented in Jiangnan in recent decades. With three months to go before the wheat harvest, it will be difficult to survive without spring relief. It is reported that Zhang Lanping and Li Tianzhen, the directors of the association's Jiangsu inspection and distribution efforts, have appointed dedicated officials in each county. However, the disaster is so severe that the relief funds are insufficient, making it like a drop in the bucket, unlikely to provide a thorough rescue. According to Cheng's inspection, Liyang is classified as a particularly severely affected area, Lishui, Gaochun, and Jiangpu as the most severely affected areas, Jurong, Jintan, and Yixing as severely affected areas, and Zhenjiang, Jiangning, and Danyang as moderately affected areas. The inspection and distribution directors have already received 100,000 yuan in relief funds from the association (including funds allocated by the Central Winter Emergency Relief Committee). They are cooperating with the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, the Chinese Morality Society, the Catholic Action Society of China, and local charities in each county, working together to supplement each other's efforts and pool resources. It is estimated that the association has allocated 3,000 yuan to Liyang, with other groups providing over 90,000 yuan; 20,000 yuan to Lishui, with other charities providing over 3,000 yuan; 14,672 yuan to Gaochun, with other charities and the county magistrate raising 8.3 million yuan themselves (the county government has allocated temporary emergency relief separately); 3,000 yuan to Jiangpu, with other charities providing 3,600 yuan, plus 600 bags of flour; 4,000 yuan to Jurong, with other charities providing 21,000 yuan; 6,000 yuan to Jintan, with other charities providing 16,000 yuan; 3,000 yuan to Yixing, with other charities providing 20,000 yuan, plus 3,500 bags of flour; 2,440 bags of flour to Zhenjiang, equivalent to approximately 6,000 yuan (the Zhenjiang local drought relief committee is providing relief separately); 13,000 yuan to Jiangning, with other charities providing over 5,500 yuan, plus over 5,000 yuan already spent on porridge (the Jiangning local drought relief committee is providing over 1,400 shi of rice separately); 5,000 yuan to Danyang, with other charities providing 16,000 yuan, and the county relief branch providing 15,000 yuan. The remaining funds are being planned by Director Zhang and others. Except for Gaochun, where cash is distributed due to transportation difficulties, the above relief funds are used to purchase rice and flour, which are distributed based on household surveys and ticket allocation, prioritizing those in greatest need. As for work relief, the provincial government's construction department has a large-scale project in each county. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association has also sent personnel to Lishui, Gaochun, and Jiangpu to carry out work relief.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Competition Between Shanghai and Wuxi Freight Lines</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, in recent years, rural areas in the interior have gone bankrupt, and all industries are extremely depressed, especially the shipping industry. Therefore, the Shanghai-Wuxi freight lines in this city, such as Gongmao Shipping Bureau, Taichang Huiji Shipping Bureau, and Xiexing Shipping and Transportation Company, considering the unprofitable business of competition among the same industry, jointly established the Shanghai-Wuxi Shipping Joint Company in April last year to seek unity. However, when the Gongmao Shipping Bureau was established, the Wuxi Zhonghua Hengyu Shipping Company (which operates on the Wuxi-Liyang route) also simultaneously established the Shanghai-Wuxi freight line. Although the Gongmao Shipping Bureau repeatedly requested the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Trade Association to argue reasonably, the competent authorities perfunctorily shirked their responsibilities, leading to fierce competition between the two parties. Until the end of last year, the authorities of Zhonghua Hengyu Company also felt the difficulty of operating and believed that fighting each other would only lead to mutual losses. Therefore, through the mediation of Zhang Fengshou, the chief supervisor of the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Trade Association, Zhonghua Hengyu Company decided to lease the business rights to the Shanghai-Wuxi Shipping Joint Company, which was jointly established by the three bureaus, for a temporary period of three years. It is reported that the lease contract has been signed and the handover has been completed in recent days. The open and secret competition between the Shanghai-Wuxi freight lines in recent months has come to an end, which is a dawn for the future of inland river shipping.</p>
<h3>Record of a Fallen Power Line on Min'guo Road</h3>
<p>A Minor Worker Narrowly Escapes Death</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 26th) at 8:45, a trolley car No. 14 of the Chinese-owned Second Road, while driving north from Laoximen to Nanyang Bridge, for some unknown reason, the trailer bell at the rear of the car suddenly malfunctioned. The power line at that location was then seen to sag, resulting in an interruption of the current and preventing the car from proceeding. As a result, trolley cars on all north-south routes passing through the Chinese concession were immediately affected, stopping midway and forming a long, snake-like line. At that time, two shop assistants from a certain store were pulling and pushing a cart loaded with three large wooden boxes of goods, proceeding along the east side of the road. When they reached the spot, they suddenly heard a loud noise, sparks flew, and the triangular cement pole on the left-hand sidewalk broke at its base and fell horizontally, landing directly on top of the cart. The two shop assistants were startled and fell to the ground. The cart was immediately crushed, tilted, and cracked. Fortunately, the shop assistants had taken a step forward, and the pole did not fall on them, so they were unharmed. This was indeed very fortunate; otherwise, even if there was no danger of electric shock, the pole would have fallen on their heads and they would have been unable to withstand it. The shock of the electricity was so extreme that passersby could not help but rejoice. Afterwards, the police on duty reported the incident to their respective stations, and the trolley car company immediately ordered workers to repair the power lines and replace the pole, and traffic was restored. It is reported that there have been three instances of power lines breaking and falling in the Laoximen area recently, but none as dangerous as this one. During the dangerous situation, the one-way traffic regulation at that location should have been immediately suspended and temporarily put on alert, but the police there still allowed other vehicles to pass, seemingly without taking any measures to stop them. This is deeply regrettable. Although a tragedy has been avoided, it is a great fortune for society. However, the relevant authorities should pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Wu Xiaoshanzi Gets Lost</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, a lost boy of about ten years old was spotted on Rue Robert in western Shanghai by a police officer, who took him to the sub-station and then transferred him to the Caojiadu branch bureau. According to the boy, his name is Wu Xiaoshanzi, he is fifteen years old, and he is from Zhenjiang. He was vague about other details, presumably because his address was unknown and no one came to claim him. He was temporarily kept at the bureau to await his family to retrieve him.</p>
<h3>Donations for Zheng Shichao's Family Awaiting Collection</h3>
<p>Funds Stored at the Ningbo Daily on Xizang Road</p>
<p>Zheng Shichao, a native of Ningbo, was working as a second officer on the Huamao ship of Renji Huaxin Company in this city. On New Year's Eve last year, Zheng fell into the cabin while working on the ship and died tragically, leaving behind his elderly mother in her seventies, as well as orphans and a widow, a family of seven, whose livelihood was cut off, a tragic and unbearable situation. Some time ago, the Shanghai Ningbo Daily published the details of the incident, and Zhou Ziqing and other enthusiastic fellow villagers saw it and took pity, remitting donations and instructing the newspaper to forward them to Zheng's family. Zheng's family originally lived at Lane 286, Rue Lafayette in the French Concession of this city, but recently moved elsewhere due to financial difficulties. Therefore, the funds cannot be forwarded. They are currently stored in the accounting department of the newspaper. Anyone who knows Zheng Shichao's family is requested to notify them immediately to collect the funds at the Fellow Villagers Service Department of the Shanghai Ningbo Daily in Pingle Lane, Xizang Road.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor:</p>
<p>We have examined the report in the local news section of your newspaper dated February 25, regarding the meeting of the Fifteenth District Branch of the Special Zone City Federation. The fourth item is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Although our association was introduced by Wan Xuanqing, an executive committee member of our association, to discuss jointly renting premises with the Fifteenth District Branch in January of last year, Zhu Zhichun of the branch did not seek our association's consent regarding the joint rental procedures, and instead acted independently, with the aim of benefiting himself, resulting in no contract being signed to date. Furthermore, according to him, the landlord suddenly increased the rent by 25% one month into the lease and signed a lease contract with the China Business Company, which manages the property. Furthermore, Zhu Zhichun acted personally on behalf of Renci Primary School, with various fraudulent acts that are difficult to describe in detail. Our association is currently negotiating based on reason. The report is clearly a one-sided promotion by the branch. In view of the inconsistency of the report, we would like to request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Inland River Shipping Trade Association, February 26.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Way to Earn a Living</h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>Since both seclusion and entering officialdom are ways to earn a living, there is no need to be coy or pretentious. Just say frankly, "I'm doing it to earn a living!" It's not necessarily demeaning, although it may seem unrefined. Generally, refined people don't like this. They prefer to put on airs, speak in a high-pitched voice, and cover their noses, uttering a delicate sound. This is a common trick of clowns on stage. Even if a clown puts on a Taoist robe, wears a turban and feather fan, and hangs a long beard, he will still have a white spot on his nose, and his voice will still be a bit strange. This is because they are "alienated."</p>
<p>A "scholar" wants to be refined and expresses it in writing, which is still just showing off. To get a reputation for refinement, smoking, drinking tea, composing poetry, occasionally copying letters from the Ming Dynasty, and being a bookworm like Yuan Zhonglang are all essential activities. I have never seen a recluse who is starving but still "studying painting snakes under the window." This shows that refinement ultimately comes from those who not only have food to eat but also have bitter tea to drink, smoke cigarettes, and play with antiques or the complete works of Yuan Zhonglang. This kind of "refinement" naturally belongs to the so-called purists. In addition, there are also many who use this as a way to earn a living. The reason why the "scholar's hat" style was so popular for a time and echoed by those who cleared the way was still the so-called "brand name earning."</p>
<p>Earning a living seems to be a very unrefined "tail" for "literati," but in fact, this "tail" is destined to be there. Since this is the case, wouldn't it be more frank and easier for everyone to show their "tails" and talk about their literature? However, "people" love refinement, especially "literati." Everyone likes to secretly raise their "tail," hide it in a gown or a tailcoat, and then stand outside and laugh at others: "Heh, a tail!"</p>
<p>Writing articles to scold others for writing articles with the intention of exchanging them for money is base and vulgar. How can he not be writing articles with the intention of exchanging them for royalties? Writing essays to denounce the "sins" of essays is not the same "path"? In the Investiture of the Gods, King Zhou and Da Ji held a grand banquet for the fox fairies at night. Although they could transform themselves into delicate beauties, their tails would still inevitably be revealed when they were drunk.</p>
<p>In this day and age, the piece of bone in the reading world is already thin enough. Since there are already many people salivating, "competition" is inevitable. You come up with a short essay journal, I come up with a humorous magazine. For a few yuan of editing fees, fellow disciples split up, each setting up their own banner, slandering each other, and claiming to be pure. This is not surprising. In the end, the tail is still for earning a living. No matter how high this "tail" is raised or how secretly it is hidden, it will always inevitably be revealed when one becomes "carried away by success" or when they are competing with each other.</p>
<p>Exchanging articles for food is not shameful. Moreover, "exchanging what one has for what one lacks" is in line with the great principle of exchange. However, those with a little "conscience" should not be like those who eat free food, using deceptive means to seize the meager money of country bumpkins. As long as the "goods are genuine and of good value," even if one occasionally earns a little, one will be "free from guilt."</p>
<h3>The Pen and the Sword</h3>
<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>When people in the past read books, or when they were filled with complaints or patriotic fervor, they would often get carried away and sing loudly: "I have a pen like a sword."</p>
<p>In fact, the pen and the sword are two completely different tools, and the fact that literati would use them to make comparisons is the same kind of feeling and lament as the words of Liu Bei in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" about his "thighs growing fat again."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that literati are born to be pale-faced scholars who "cannot even truss a chicken." They do not have the kind of power and valor of military generals charging into battle. They can only wield pens and are not good at wielding swords, let alone being able to kill people with swords. This seems to have become a matter of course. However, they actually dare to compare their pens to swords, which shows their unwillingness to be outdone.</p>
<p>When literati say that their pens can be used as swords, they are not exaggerating at all. Just look at how the wise emperors of the past established imperial examinations to select scholars, and it has been like this since ancient times. Therefore, there are martial arts champions, and there must also be literary champions. Moreover, what is obtained from under the pen is often as easy as taking something out of a bag, without any effort. There is no need to risk one's life like those in the martial arts, who are gasping for breath like cows. The power under the pen is not only "like a sword" but sometimes even "surpasses the sword."</p>
<p>In the past, the boundaries between the literary and military worlds were strict, but there were still so-called scholar-generals. To put it bluntly, a scholar-general is called that because he has a bit of literary talent in his martial arts skills, which makes him refined. Because he can wield a sword and kill people and also wield a pen, he is no longer just a brave man. People value him and call him both literary and martial. Therefore, it is easy for him to become a marshal or commander. This is after all thanks to his ability to use the pen.</p>
<p>Guan Yu was the number one master of the sword among military generals, but his skills were limited to the dragging sword trick. Even if it has not been lost to this day, it is no match for airplanes and cannons, and a match for ten thousand men has become futile. However, the tricks under the pen of literati have not become outdated but have made amazing progress.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that literati can use this pen as a stepping stone to advancement; more importantly, it can be used as a weapon. They can use it to reverse right and wrong, fabricate rumors, and cheat. Although it is just a pen, it has become a real sword, a hidden arrow, and a smoke bomb, these modern lethal weapons in the hands of literati.</p>
<p>Take tactics as an example: warriors have always relied on brute force to win, but literati use wit, and it is still wit to this day. They can avoid fighting the enemy head-on and cleverly know how to attack from the side, making you unable to defend yourself. It is truly like sweeping away thousands of troops with a pen, invincible and unbeatable in every battle.</p>
<p>The saying "a pen like a sword" may seem like a complaint from a literati who is not recognized, but in the past, it was mostly thought of in a positive way; it was thought that the force of the pen was dedicated to slaying evil and eliminating wickedness. Now we know that this is a big mistake!</p>
<p>A pen is indeed "like a sword" and can even "surpass a sword." Therefore, in modern times, it is enough to make people shudder that this "sword-like" or "sword-surpassing" pen is held in the hands of literati. In addition, the articles that are popular internationally, such as those about "maintaining peace," are just great literati with high noses copying the Chinese way of kingship, and the writing style is different again! When the pen reaches the hands of those literati of material civilization, it becomes even more advanced and scientific: that pen is not just "like a sword" or "surpasses a sword" but is actually poison gas.</p>
<h3>Yearning in Literature</h3>
<p>— Bai Lai</p>
<p>"End of the century" patients of sadness have no philosophy of "tomorrow," they are short sighted, only seeing "nearby" and only seeing "the present." If this is expressed in literary productions, it is a sketch without yearning. However, it is a matter of course that such works, even if they have excellent technique, will not be given a high evaluation by every realist reader. In our China, "I urge you not to begrudge the brocade robe, I urge you to cherish your youth; when there are flowers to pluck, pluck them straight away, do not wait until there are no flowers and pluck the empty branches." That is truly a good example of a poem without yearning. Furthermore, the author of "Immensee," Theodor Storm, once sang like this:</p>
<p>"Today only today, you are still so graceful; tomorrow, ah tomorrow, everything will be over - only at this moment are you all mine. At the time of death, ah at the time of death, I should be buried alone in the wilderness"!</p>
<p>However, as an author with a sense of justice, he has a longing for "light" and an expectation for "dawn." Even for the sake of this yearning for the "future," he does not hesitate to endure the pain and suffering that are not "human" should endure. Of course, we do not believe that all productions with yearning are righteous. Tao Yuanming's "Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" only depicts the author's intention of "hermit philosophy." But how fortunate we should be to feel, in Gorky's "Song of the Falcon," this outstanding song of yearning for "tomorrow." Moreover, these two are undoubtedly a pair of extreme contrasts. And the latter will be given immortal life because of its active struggle philosophy, which should be the inevitable result based on historical development.</p>
<p>Literature has already reached a time of settlement. All works, whether negated or preserved, will not be submitted blankly in this sense.</p>
<h3>Historical Anecdotes and Trivia (6)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about elaboration. In the Analects, the chapter about Confucius going to Qi depicts Confucius's embarrassing situation, which is indeed suitable material for a short piece. The script I mentioned earlier elaborated on the entire passage, saying:</p>
<p>"He and his disciples… along the way, they could not fully appreciate the scenery of Xiaoxiang, when suddenly they encountered a madman in front of the carriage. He was walking along while singing, singing 'Two Phoenixes Chirping, News Spreads Throughout the Land.' He said: 'Emperor Shun is gone, King Wen is dead, how can the Shaole music and Mount Qi be found in Hanyang County! Don't talk about your past wanderings, now that your wings are tired, you should know it's time to return. Look at this Yingzhong, where are the parasol trees? Why not find a high hill to settle down? You only think of shouting loudly to make the world know, but you don't think of the wronged Long Feng and Bi Gan!' He sang and pretended to leave, which made Confucius's heart ache. …The old master stepped forward to speak, but he hurried away in a puff of smoke. They got back into the carriage feeling disheartened, and suddenly looked up to see waves rolling in front of them. The disciples reined in their horses and couldn't pass, and saw two farmers plowing in the countryside. Confucius instructed, 'Zhong You, go and ask where the water is shallow enough to cross by boat.' Zhong You heard this and didn't delay, striding forward. He said, 'I'm asking you old brother for directions, tell me where the ford is and where the bend is.' Chang Ju said, 'Who is sitting in the carriage?' Zilu said, 'It's Confucius, famous throughout the world.' Chang Ju said, 'Could it be that he lives in Gunzhou Prefecture?' Zilu replied, 'Yes, yes, yes!' Chang Ju said, 'He has traveled all over thirteen provinces, and the disciples he teaches are all sages.' After speaking, he drove the yellow ox, whipping it quickly. Zilu, the brave man, stared, and had no choice but to ask Jie Ni again. Jie Ni said, 'You don't look like a local, tell me your family name and hometown.' Zilu said, 'I live by the Si River, my surname is Zhong.' Jie Ni said, 'You are a disciple of a sage, good at boxing.' Zilu said, 'Since you know my name, you must be an acquaintance, why don't you quickly point out the ford?' Jie Ni said, 'Why are you so restless when the night is short and the days are long! Listen to me slowly from the beginning: haven't you seen the sea turn into fields and the fields turn into sea, haven't you seen the blue sky connected to the water and the water connected to the sky! Even if you have the skill to pluck stars and change the moon, you can't turn the world upside down! Instead of following him and traveling around causing trouble, why don't you abandon writing and take up arms to learn farming? Eating a ready-made bowl of rice at home during the day is better than starving and turning your eyes blue in Chen. Sleeping soundly behind closed doors at night is better than being frightened in Kuang. These are all golden words to advise you, whether you follow them or not is up to you, what does it have to do with me.' Saying this, he turned back to plow the fields, the two farmers one after the other. Zhong You had never been humiliated, and was angered by the two plowing farmers. 'If I had my old fierce temper, I would definitely kick and punch them. Annoyed, I would lift their legs and throw them into the river, surely the fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs would have a feast!'"</p>
<h3>Settlement (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xia Shi</p>
<p>The north wind howled, and darkness pressed down on the earth, everything shivering in the dark.</p>
<p>"Damn it? So cold!" Li Sheng, hugging a bamboo fire pot, cursed the weather listlessly. The room was pitch black. From another corner came a woman's voice.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to settle accounts with Master Si?" This was his wife.</p>
<p>Li Sheng didn't answer. The broken walls around them echoed with creaks. He thought:</p>
<p>"Settle what ghost! Every year is worse than the last, it's not like I'm being someone else's son for nothing!"</p>
<p>Even so, the sound of his slippers, "bie da ti da," moved toward the door.</p>
<p>Stepping out the door, it was even colder. The wind pierced his body in gusts from the collar, cuffs, and trouser legs, piercing straight through his heart. He shivered, quickly wrapping his scarf around his neck, shrinking his hands into his sleeves, and holding the fire pot close to his body.</p>
<p>All he could see was darkness. The alley was winding, turning left, turning right, and if he wasn't careful, his head would bump into the wall. Even though he knew the way well, he still had to move slowly.</p>
<p>There was a lot of cow dung in the alley; he couldn't blame anyone for that, he just had to be careful. He stared especially at the ground: he stared, but it was useless, it was dark. His foot slipped, the stench of manure rushed into his nose, his shoes, maybe his socks, his trouser legs were covered in manure. "Damn it!" What could he do, he cursed himself.</p>
<p>He hadn't eaten dinner. Not eating, sleeping early, that's how it always was in winter. Today, he couldn't sleep, settling these damn accounts was important; his stomach felt a little empty, so he thought:</p>
<p>"I'll go to Boss Han's place for a drink."</p>
<p>Walking past Boss Han's shop, which was a shrine that Boss Han rented as a shop, he saw lamplight and people talking through the cracks in the door. Li Sheng kicked the door open.</p>
<p>Carpenter Lao Er was drinking. Boss Han sat at the head of the table, his dry tobacco pipe suddenly pointing straight down at the leg of the stool.</p>
<p>"Drinking!" Lao Er greeted him.</p>
<p>"Sit!" Boss Han nodded coldly.</p>
<p>"So cold!" Li Sheng also nodded, stretching his foot out into the light. Then, he put his foot down and stomped, stomped, the sole of his shoe felt lighter, the cow dung stuck to the ground. So, he sat down, facing Lao Er. He opened his mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Damn it! Got manure all over my foot!" Then:</p>
<p>"Lao Er! When did you come back?" Followed by:</p>
<p>"Half a catty of Zhajiu wine, four taels of peanuts." His voice gradually lowered.</p>
<p>Boss Han lazily, as if he couldn't lift his body, asked again, weighing his words, "Half a catty?"</p>
<p>Li Sheng didn't answer, he and Lao Er were talking. The boss grunted, only biting his tobacco pipe and walking towards the cabinet.</p>
<p>"Business is good this year, right?" Li Sheng asked.</p>
<p>"Just making ends meet. It's not as good as you guys farming in the countryside." Lao Er sighed.</p>
<p>"Farming good? We can't even make ends meet." Li Sheng said resentfully.</p>
<p>"No wonder! The harvests have been so bad these past few years. If the harvests are bad, isn't it just as hard to be a craftsman? If you can't sell what you make, what can you do?" Lao Er said.</p>
<p>"You're always better off than farming! Like me, I rent all my land from other people, even if the harvest is good… Ah! The rich are so evil these days." Li Sheng shook his head wildly, as if overwhelmed by pain.</p>
<p>Lao Er stopped talking, pouring half a bowl of wine for Li Sheng, and then:</p>
<p>"Have a drink! It might snow tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Don't stand on ceremony!" Li Sheng declined, his eyes moving towards Boss Han behind the counter.</p>
<p>Boss Han was busy serving the wine and weighing peanuts, still lazily. He answered Lao Er's words:</p>
<p>"It'll snow in the winter, a good harvest next year will come after the snow."</p>
<p>Even though he was slow, the Zhajiu wine and peanuts finally arrived at the table. Li Sheng picked up the pot, wanting to toast Lao Er, but Lao Er refused; so he poured a full bowl of wine for himself. Boss Han was still listless, continuing to shell peanuts.</p>
<p>"Are things okay this year?" The boss asked.</p>
<p>"Um…" Li Sheng didn't say anything, the wine rolling down his throat.</p>
<p>"The amount you owe me, this year…" It was the boss speaking.</p>
<p>"Um…" Another sip of wine.</p>
<p>"A total of one thousand two hundred, and some of it is owed from last year." The boss took the tobacco pipe away and blew out a big puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"Um…" Another sip. The wine was gone, Li Sheng stood up. "How much? I'll pay you back in a while, there are still three days until the New Year." Then, to Lao Er:</p>
<p>"You sit some more! Damn it! I still have to go to Master Si's house to settle accounts."</p>
<p>Boss Han picked up the abacus, calculating two hundred for the wine, sixty for the peanuts, plus the old debts, totaling one thousand four hundred and sixty. He put down the abacus and shouted heavily:</p>
<p>"One thousand four hundred and sixty."</p>
<p>Li Sheng didn't say anything, picked up the bamboo fire pot, and walked away, the boss's voice chasing after him.</p>
<p>"If you don't pay this year, it won't work! Everyone's like you, how can I do business?"</p>
<p>Li Sheng was very angry; but he couldn't do anything, he didn't have any money, so he could only vent his anger in private, cursing:</p>
<p>"This old guy is really troublesome!"</p>
<p>The turn was Master Si's house. Li Sheng's heart was pounding, he was a little flustered, stopping at the door. After a while, he pushed the door open and went inside.</p>
<h3>Towards Evening (8)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The pot-bellied man, who was working diligently, even swallowing the smoke, hated that his throat didn't have a few more sections, as he had no time to answer. Only when the end of the cigarette burned down to the last bit and he could no longer draw smoke, he sat up, closed his mouth, not letting a wisp of smoke escape. He hurriedly picked up the teapot, took a sip of tea, and swallowed the tea and smoke down his stomach. Then he finally took a breath, jumped off the bed, clapped his hands and shouted, "That's right! That's right! Only someone like you can annotate Tang poetry!"</p>
<p>The pot-bellied man's slipper sound echoed between the pit beds, "tie da tie da." Outside the door came a burst of "du du" leather shoe sounds.</p>
<p>"Who is it!" Hu Yiyuan asked calmly. His voice sounded quite experienced and with some disdain.</p>
<p>"It's me. -- We are." A confident answer:</p>
<p>"Guo Ren and Li An!" Sharp, crisp, and clear. -- With a sentiment that trembled out from the strings of a bright and ornate lyre.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Hu Yiyuan immediately jumped off the pit bed, walked out of the cave door, with the pot-bellied man following behind.</p>
<p>A tall, thin shadow that almost touched the ceiling, and a short, fat man whose shoulders were level with the mahogany square table in the room, appeared in room thirteen.</p>
<p>"Oh!" An oval face tilted up. Hu Yiyuan took a step forward, and with the sleeves of his short gown, which were longer than his fingers, gave a deep bow. "Rare! Rare! Did you receive my note?"</p>
<p>"Of course!" The tall, thin man lowered his head, looking at Hu Yiyuan, while desperately sniffing his nose. "Mm! It smells good!"</p>
<p>"Smells good." The short, fat man tilted his head, his eyes darting around the ceiling and corners of the room, as if trying to find the secrets of this room.</p>
<p>"But what's the matter?" The tall man asked again.</p>

<h3>International Basketball Interest Waned, Women's Championship Suspended</h3>
<p>Westerners do not participate in women's rules.</p>
<p>Only two teams, China and the United States, in the men's division.</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai International Basketball Championship, which the Sports Advancement Association (體恊進會) has announced, was scheduled to begin registration on Saturday, March 2nd. The deadline has already passed. There are only two teams in the men's division, China and the United States, and a best-of-three series will be held. In the women's division, the British and American teams are both using men's rules for their matches, so it is inconvenient for them to participate in matches with women's rules. However, the authorities of the Sports Advancement Association believe that women throughout the country should uniformly use women's rules and cannot change them because of this, causing confusion. Therefore, it has been decided that this year's women's championship will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association Women's Division A Southeast Defeats Jinan Again</h3>
<p>Association to award prizes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held two games last night, one for women's Division A and one for women's Division B, as well as two scenes for men's Division B.

In the women's division, Southeast Division A defeated Huadong to win, and in Division B Group 3, Dahua won with a score of 34 to 21.</p>
<p>Huadong Defeats Jiang Jiang: After a fierce battle, both sides were equally matched. Fortunately, Huadong scored seven points in the second quarter, so although Jiang Jiang showed great spirit later, they could not reverse the situation, and they were defeated with a score of 10 to 12.</p>
<p>Southeast Division A Defeats Jinan: (Women's Division A) This year's Shanghai Women's Basketball Division A originally had four teams, but because Liangjiang and Chongde withdrew for reasons, only the Southeast Division A and Jinan teams competed, resulting in the cancellation of the championship. The committee arranged a best-of-three friendly match. Now, Southeast has won two games in a row and taken the lead, and the Association will award prizes to commemorate this. In yesterday's match, it was all about Southeast, and Jinan's resistance was also very hard, but they could not turn the tide, and Southeast won with a score of 32 to 9.</p>

<h3>The Location of the 12th World Games Has Not Yet Been Decided</h3>
<p>Italy, Japan, and Finland compete with each other.</p>
<p>Decision to be made by postal vote</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, Oslo, 25th) The International Olympic Committee held a meeting in the auditorium of the university here. Representatives from France, Sweden, Hungary, Finland, Greece, Yugoslavia, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Latvia, Canada, Poland, Bulgaria, Denmark, Japan, Egypt, New Zealand, Norway, and other countries attended. Japanese representative Sugimura declared that Japan believes that the 1940 World Games should be held in Tokyo, as it is the fairest, as the World Games have never been held in Asia, and 1940 is the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire. Sugimura continued that he had met with Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome, and Mussolini told him that if it could be determined that the 1944 World Games would be held in Italy, then Italy would support the holding of the 1940 Games in Japan. At this point, Committee Chairman Belaire and the Italian representative declared that the Committee could not agree on the location of the World Games so many years in advance, so there could be no guarantee regarding the location of the 1944 Games. Therefore, Italy and Japan simultaneously proposed to be the location of the 1940 Games. Counting Finland, there are three candidates in total. It is difficult to predict which country will be selected. It may be decided at this International Committee meeting, but some representatives advocate postponing this issue temporarily and deciding it by postal vote, because there are a total of 50 countries participating in the World Games, but only 24 countries attended this Committee meeting. No communique was issued after today's meeting, but it is heard that a plenary meeting will be held tomorrow to pass the procedures for the 1936 World Games (to be held in Berlin). Only one item will be modified, and the rest will follow the program of the previous Games. After today's meeting, the representatives of the participating countries were received by the King of Norway.</p>
<p>(Japan Associated Press, Oslo, 25th) The Olympic Committee held a meeting here today to discuss the location of the 12th Games. Japan, Italy, and Finland are competing for the location, and the representatives of the participating countries are also considering their own interests and intend to elect the most advantageous candidate site. Although Italy had previously indicated its willingness to concede to Japan and recognize that the meeting would be held in Tokyo, it changed its policy after realizing that the committee could not guarantee that the 13th Games would be held in Italy. It still insisted that the 12th Games be held in Rome. Japan's position is therefore unfavorable, and it is not optimistic about persuading them to host it in Tokyo.</p>

<h3>Fudan Football Team Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tomorrow against Fu Jen University</p>
<p>(Beiping, 26th) The 17-member Fudan Football Expedition Team, led by Chen Bingde, arrived in Beiping this morning and stayed at Huishi High School. After a short rest, they are scheduled to play their first introductory match with the Fu Jen team on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Amateur Division A Billiards Competition Zhang Yingda's Amazing Achievement</h3>
<p>Winning Former Champion Medina Will Compete with Li Gongying in the Final</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Division A Billiards Competition has been very competitive since its start. Chinese billiards player Zhang Yingda, in a rematch with former Portuguese champion Medina yesterday, suddenly made an amazing move, scoring 1,000 points against 874, and will compete with Chinese Billiards King Li Gongying in the final on March 3rd and 4th. This is the first time since the start of the Division A competition that Chinese players have competed for the championship in the final.</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda is Truly Capable: Mr. Zhang Yingda previously won the Division B championship, and his skills have improved rapidly in recent years. Yesterday's performance did not fully display his talents, and his positioning and layout were not satisfactory, but his opening was excellent, with a high probability of hitting every ball. The first game of 500 points was very promising, ending with 500 points against 37. The second game was a confrontation, and it was difficult to gain an advantage. If a foundation had not been laid in the first game, there might have been unexpected changes later. The key to his victory was the average score, with 17 times exceeding 20 points in the last two games, and the highest score being 64.</p>
<p>How Unfortunate Medina Is: Unfortunately, Medina succumbed to Zhang Yingda and could not display his past championship skills, which was probably unexpected. From beginning to end, every time he was on a smooth path, he would make inexplicable mistakes. He initially took the lead, leading by 100 points after a few shots, but when Zhang Yingda scored a huge number of points, he became uneasy and fell behind by 123 points in the first game. In the second game, when Zhang Yingda reached 900 points, he made a comeback, and after scoring 68 points once, he suddenly lost a promising opportunity, and his chances of winning were cut off, resulting in a loss of 126 points.</p>
<p>High Scores of the Two Players: (Zhang Yingda) 57, 33, 28, 44, 25, 32, 32, 64, 26, 57, 22, 26, 22, 23, 22, 28, 22, (Medina) 32, 53, 41, 44, 30, 34, 36, 25, 24, 26, 21, 68, 24,</p>
<h3>The List of Champions of the Ball Games of Various Independent Colleges is Announced</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Sports Games of Various Independent Colleges held basketball, football, tennis, table tennis, and other championships last semester, and the results were satisfactory and excellent. However, at the end of last semester's competition, it coincided with the major examination period of each school, and all unfinished matters were not completed. Now that the schools have started, it is heard that the association has also scheduled a meeting of representatives from each school on the second of next month to discuss the ending matters of the last semester and the matters for this semester. The list of champions of the association's ball games last semester is listed below:</p>

<h3>The Fujian Women's Basketball Championship Team Xiamen Qunhui Won Against the Entire Philippine Team Yesterday</h3>
<p>Score: 20 to 9</p>
<p>(Manila, 26th) The Xiamen Qunhui Women's Basketball Team is the Fujian Provincial Women's Basketball Championship Team. This time, they arrived in the Philippines with the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team and were warmly welcomed by the overseas Chinese. Its strength is comparable to that of Liangjiang. In the Philippines, they defeated the Quanmin All-Star Team with a score of 40 to 8 and lost to Liangjiang by only one point. The team played against the All-Philippines Team organized by Filipinos yesterday, and Qunhui won with a score of 21 to 9.</p>
<p>Liangjiang Qunhui Cause a Sensation in Manila (Special Correspondent in Manila) The Manila Overseas Chinese Sports Association, since its founding under the advocacy of Wang Zhengting, a representative of the Far East Games last year, has been organized and established. The National Day sports meeting of overseas Chinese was held on the Double Tenth Festival at the Sali Memorial Ground, and the impression was excellent. In order to promote women's sports and add to the excitement of the Carnival, the Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Professional Basketball Team was invited to compete with the Philippine Women's Basketball Team during this Carnival to encourage Chinese women to pay attention to sports. The basketball team organized by the Shanghai Liangjiang Women's Professional School of Sports has a considerable history. In the spring of 1931, they went to Japan to compete with famous teams in Tokyo, Nagasaki, Osaka, etc., and won all 14 games. On the way back, they also won all the games in various parts of the Northeast. They had long wanted to travel to famous ports overseas to learn from each other, so they gladly accepted the invitation from the Overseas Chinese Sports Association. The Qunhui Women's School in Xiamen is currently at the primary school level. The organization of the basketball team does not have a long history, but because of its rapid progress, it has become a rising star and is now at the forefront of women's basketball teams in Xiamen. At the opening of the Fujian Provincial Games last year, they defeated the Jimei Women's Basketball Team, which had won the championship many times, and its reputation has since spread throughout Xiamen and Fujian. Since the beginning of Qunhui's organization, it has received a lot of support from overseas Chinese. The construction of the new school building has all come from the enthusiastic donations of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The person in charge has long communicated with the overseas Chinese community. This trip to the south is to show that the donations received have yielded considerable results and to express gratitude. Our Overseas Chinese Sports Association, seeing that both women's basketball teams are willing to come, has arranged for them to compete with the Jiangsu and Manila Central Women's Basketball Teams. The venue is the St. Domitus University Sports Ground, and the result was 49 to 13. More than 3,000 spectators, including Americans and Filipinos, were impressed by Liangjiang's high and skilled basketball skills. On the 16th night, the Qunying Team played against the Quanmin Women's All-Star Team. The venue was still the same. Seeing that the Liangjiang team had such good results the night before, the Qunhui Team naturally concentrated their efforts and were unwilling to fall behind. The result was 40 to 8. On the afternoon of the 17th, the Liangjiang Team played against the All-Philippines All-Star Team. Seeing that the Qunhui Team had also made remarkable achievements, the Liangjiang Team naturally worked harder and subdued the Quanmin All-Star Team with a score of 57 to 2. Moreover, these two points were due to fouls. In terms of the battlefield, Liangjiang can be said to have not lost a single soldier or arrow, which is truly breaking a new record in the basketball world. Our country's female athletes have come here to perform and have all won victories. The fame of Ms. Yang Xiuqiong in the Far East Games almost shook the entire Philippines. Now, these two teams have also received good reviews from foreign newspapers, which is not easy.</p>
<p>Wanxia Table Tennis Seeks Members</p>
<p>The Wanxia Table Tennis Team, which has been established for two years, is now publicly soliciting new team members in order to strengthen its strength. All comrades who love table tennis are welcome to join. The team address is No. 148, Lan Wei Ai Road. Please send a self addressed envelope with a two-cent stamp to receive a brochure.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order for Improving Vocational Education in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently received a report from Inspector Gu Zhaolin regarding his previous inspection of vocational education in Jiangxi Province. The Ministry has now issued an order to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education to implement the various points for improvement in vocational schools in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, it was found that vocational schools in Jiangxi Province, with the exception of agriculture (where the provincial agricultural institute is conducting experiments on various agricultural products and promoting them uniformly), have been increasing equipment year by year in the industrial and commercial departments, and school affairs have been progressing daily. Many new courses have been established in various schools, which is quite impressive. The Department of Education is comprehensively planning the overall situation and implementing it according to a predetermined plan, making considerable efforts in promotion. Although private vocational schools may not have many locations and their facilities are simple, their spirit of perseverance and excellence is commendable. The points that should be improved are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) The Jiangxi Provincial Vocational Schools have increased equipment in their industrial and commercial departments and are paying attention to guiding students in practical training. The newly established vocational courses are particularly well-run. The vocational school improvement plan proposed by the Department of Education is also practical and appropriate. However, some courses established in the past still do not align with local conditions. In the future, they should be promoted in accordance with the original plan at any time to achieve comprehensive improvement.</p>
<p>(2) Among the courses offered by various vocational schools, applied chemistry is the most difficult to manage. Vocational equipment is insufficient, the types of manufactured goods are extensive, and they do not correspond to local needs. Students have no certainty of employment. In the future, the principle should be to change to other suitable courses. If it is difficult to handle, the scope should be reduced to specialize in one or several types of manufacturing. Each school should add equipment based on the research project it is studying to avoid duplication. The dyeing and weaving course also has the same situation. It is necessary to study and organize patterns and create new products independently, instead of simply copying the patterns of Shanghai factories, to seek improvement. All these reforms must be formulated by the schools and submitted to the Department for overall review.</p>
<p>(3) The practical factories and shops of the provincial vocational schools that belong to the commercial scope generally lack working capital. The Department of Education can assist in implementing the projects with certainty by lending money from banks to increase production efficiency. With many schools in the provincial capital, the consumption of student uniforms and other supplies is significant. If cooperatives can be organized within the possible scope of vocational school industry and commerce, the existing dyeing, weaving, sewing, and commercial departments can expand student practical training opportunities and increase work efficiency, which will also be helpful for future employment.</p>
<p>(4) The practical training in the printing department of Provincial Vocational School No. 1 is excellent. Students are actively working, and the management is relatively proper. Students in the dyeing and weaving department also have a strong interest in practical training, and the finished products are impressive. The new courses offered by the school meet the needs of local production, while the performance of the original courses, such as applied chemistry, is relatively poor and should be improved.</p>
<p>(5) The commercial department of Provincial Vocational School No. 2 has achieved success in managing a bank by raising shares. Deposits from all sectors have reached more than ten thousand, and it has obtained the position of acting as the treasury for various schools. Students have gained practical experience, and employment is not a problem. This can be said to have grasped the key points and is commendable. The school is currently piloting a rural loan business, which is said to have promising prospects and should be continued. However, Jiangxi Province is rich in products, and businesses such as transportation, warehousing, and insurance related to commerce should also be planned appropriately. Efforts should be made to ensure that those who wish to serve in cities or rural areas have opportunities for operation and practice so as not to be biased. If the school can do it, it should set up specialized courses in the senior classes to focus on practice.</p>
<p>(6) Although the equipment of the machinery department of the advanced vocational department attached to the Provincial Industrial College has increased, it is still simple, and the foundation is not solid. There are very few machinery factories in Jiangxi Province. Even manufacturing parts and machines is not possible, and the equipment for repairing parts is also rare. Based on local needs, the school should pay special attention to practical work in guiding students' practical training. The soy sauce brewing in the applied chemistry department can already become a commodity, and leather making is also impressive. The soap-making machine has been installed but has not yet started. Compared with the same courses in other vocational schools, there is hope. Special attention should be paid to students' practical work to seek proficiency and practicality.</p>
<p>(7) The sewing course of the art department of the Provincial Women's Vocational School should follow the cooperative model commonly used in Hunan Province, which should be set up by the school, and the price for making clothes should be set and managed on behalf of the students (the price income can be used as a reward for students). Efforts should be made to provide students with social materials for practical training, and at the same time, cultivate students' correct concepts of production and occupation. If managed properly, all school student uniforms can be made. However, the applied chemistry course has very simple equipment and cannot be practiced. Another reconstruction plan should be prepared. The school site is small, and the factory has been taken back by the government, resulting in the purchased machinery of the dyeing and weaving department being unable to be installed due to lack of space. This is a pity. Whether the government should allocate a school base in the suburbs and sell the original school site at a reasonable price to build a new school building should be planned and implemented in detail by the Department.</p>
<p>(8) The Jiujiang Ceramics Vocational School is relocating and arranging, and it is not yet ready. It has not been inspected. According to Jiangxi porcelain industry, the quality is very good, and it has its own valuable value, but it is not easy to make ordinary, thick and solid utensils, and compete with imported porcelain. After discussing with Zhang Hao, the principal of the school, attention should be paid to the method of making antique porcelain from the Ming and Qing Dynasties and the preservation and improvement of patterns and colors, and to start collecting various manuals, keep and develop the exquisite points of the inherent porcelain, which is more practical than imitating imported goods. In addition, in the manual porcelain making, attention should be paid to the use and creation of simple mechanical tools, and do not let it be comfortable with the familiar manual techniques and do not think about improving them. This is most important.</p>
<p>(9) The vocational department of Private Jiansheng Middle School has the most enthusiastic spirit of learning, practice, and work, and its skills are pure and can be called the crown. However, it is difficult to take care of multiple departments with a small amount of funds. Although the vocational equipment is mostly simple and easy to set up, in order to train students' skills, the equipment is too lacking, and more complex work cannot be practiced, let alone creation. On the one hand, students' skills should be trained with simple equipment, and on the other hand, various vocational machine tools and appliances should be added to arouse their interest in research and experimentation, and within the scope of not violating the school's spirit of hard work, increase opportunities for students to study unknown knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>(10) The vocational department attached to the Private Jiangxi Provincial Middle School has made considerable achievements in the manufacture of animal and plant specimens, and its simple physical and chemical instruments can also be unique and use waste materials, which is very commendable. Looking at the operating conditions of the department, it is better to focus on the biological specimens model, and it is not impossible to specialize in the manufacture of this type. However, relying solely on simple tools is less effective. One factory should be converted from the remaining houses in the school, and various utensils should be added, which must be more substantial, in line with the meaning of good things and tools, so as not to rely on both hands to flow into emptiness. As for the proposed manufacturing, it is a larger scale, but the local needs and operating methods must be clearly investigated before implementation.</p>
<p>(11) The Provincial Women's Vocational Supplementary School's embroidery, sewing, and other departments are slightly similar to the operating methods of vocational schools in Hunan Province and can still take into account the facts. Unfortunately, students come to study for different purposes, and vocational training is prone to failure. Efforts should be made to correct this. Those who are older, out of school, and do not intend to work should be combined into one class or increase classes appropriately to provide ordinary remedial education. Then, for those who are determined to work, the purpose is simple, and training and teaching will inevitably be easier.</p>
<p>(12) The Provincial Liantang Rural Normal School has a very good school site environment and is well-run. The implementation of the labor department is particularly effective. Unfortunately, the soil is too poor, and all practical and experimental matters are very difficult. There is not much hope for agriculture. Based on the original labor department, two factories of carpentry and ironwork can be established, and simple mechanical tools can be used to manufacture practical products such as tools, agricultural tools, school tools, and simple specimen instruments. The school is located in the fields, and it can make every effort to promote various educations. Students' service opportunities can also be increased, which will be helpful for the promotion of rural instructors.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Art College Exhibition in the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Yan Wenchun from Manila)</p>
<p>Philippine and American People are Delighted</p>
<p>Seeing the Mission of Communicating Chinese and Philippine Culture</p>
<p>Shanghai Art College came to Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands, to prepare a modern calligraphy and painting exhibition. It was hosted by the consulate and relied on the help of the education community. It was prepared last week. The venue was divided into two parts. One was in the Chinese-owned Oriental Club. Because it is far from the Chinese city, the place is elegant and wide, which is convenient for receiving foreign guests. One is in the Chinese Youth Association to facilitate visits by overseas Chinese. On the 12th of this month, Consul General Deng held a tea party to invite people from the American and Philippine political, academic, and overseas Chinese communities. There were four to five hundred people. The Oriental Club displayed more than 200 items, including a huge snow scene landscape painted by the Ming Dynasty painter Hu Gongmai. The mountain light and snow color were so dazzling that, according to archaeologists, the paper color was old and it was indeed an object from three or four hundred years ago. Wu Changshuo's two paintings of plum and bamboo follow his ideas, with an antique charm. Liu Haisu's ink-splashed sleeping lion, Qingtan buffalo, Cangsong flying eagle, tired birds on stones, and Qiutan rest shadow are all powerful in their brushstrokes, with a general sweeping thousands of troops. Foreigners who do not know Chinese characters and do not know the master Liu's fame, also worship it. The works of Zhu Wenyun are also excellent. A snow bamboo painting, when seen in the tropics, makes people feel cold and refreshed. His ink lotus, ink chrysanthemum, and ink plum also have unique charm. The products of Zhu Lesan are also good, which can be said to be two difficult to parallel. Zhang Xuan's Buddha statue and female figure have another style. Wang Jiyuan also has many works. The still life flowers, fruits and vegetables in Chinese paintings are very well colored. A "Jiangshan Yanyu Tu" painting was exchanged with the "Banana Shadow Thatched Cottage" of the Dean of the Philippine University Art Institute and listed in the venue. The foreign newspaper took color photos. After Wang Jun came to Manila, several Western paintings and sketches, with appropriate colors, were deep and shallow. His two "Huangshan Xiaojing" paintings use novel brushstrokes and are well-rendered. The works of other famous artists such as Wang Yiting, Liang Kaishi, Wu Wenzhi, Chen Shuren, and Wang Taomin are also very precious. Chairman Lin also has several paintings in Chinese characters, mostly four-character auspicious words, such as "Jiusi Qinming", "Self-improvement", "Love and Spirit", etc., which do not take off the spirit of a charitable old man. The rest are the ink marks of the current leaders of the party and government circles. The Oriental Club exhibited them. Because of the vigorous publicity by foreign newspapers, the upper-class women who visited every day are constantly in. The Manila Daily Bulletin, which is published by the Americans in Manila, said that this exhibition can give the Philippines and foreigners unlimited spiritual comfort. Foreign newspapers commented on this exhibition as follows: Chinese paintings, based on the number of products, flowers and birds represent the forms of temperate zone plants and animals in the four seasons, landscape paintings are ideal characters, expressing the superb ideas of Chinese artists, Buddha statues and female figures, expressing the decorations of ancient China, and the materials for painting are mostly Chinese ink, brush, silk and paper, such as the ancient painting valued at 1,200 yuan (referring to Hu Gongmai's painting in the Ming Dynasty) is only written with brush and ink, which makes it possible to turn the peak and turn the road, and the rock and ravine are clear. The size of the paintings is in line with the standards of Chinese artists, and the hanging point is from top to bottom, which can also show that Chinese art starts from the highest point to achieve its purpose. As far as words are concerned, it can be said to be a unique art in Chinese and Japanese culture, which cannot be measured by Westerners.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Philippine art has been influenced by Spanish pottery in the past, so its architecture and sculpture contain the ancient Roman style. In the past 30 years, it has changed to the habits of the New Continent. Although China and the Philippines are separated by a narrow strip of water, their various relationships have a long history. However, it is the first time to make Filipinos recognize the original artistic value and characteristics of China in a public venue, and it can also enable overseas Chinese who are always in the coconut shadow and betel nut wind environment to recognize the inherent art of the motherland. The current situation is also being promoted, and it has another unique style.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Agricultural Society</h3>
<p>The Location is Set in Guangxi, Hunan and Jiangxi</p>
<p>—Nomination of Preparatory Committee Members of the Japanese Branch—</p>
<p>The Chinese Agricultural Society recently held its first council meeting of this year in Beijing. More than a dozen council members, including Liang Xi, attended. Many resolutions were passed. The following is an excerpt of the main points: (1) For the 18th annual meeting this year, it is reported that Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Henan have successively sent letters requesting to hold the meeting there. After the meeting, it was decided that the date of the annual meeting would be in early July, and the location would be selected from Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi. How to proceed from now on will be organized after consultation with all parties; (2) The preparatory committee for the study of agricultural science will be handled by the association. Recently, more and more people have joined the association as members. The association believes that it is necessary to establish a branch and has nominated Zhang Qingjian, Zhu Xuezeng, and others, who are members studying in Japan, to prepare; (3) Nomination of local officers, a total of sixteen provinces, two special municipalities, and three overseas locations, with more than fifty officers; (4) Nomination of Qian Tianhe, Zeng Jikuan, and other seven people as fund custodians. There are about twenty other routine cases. It is also reported that the first essay contest for the Fei Shi Scholarship of the association has been announced, and the winners are Wang Zhongyi and Zheng Naitao.</p>
<h3>Chen Yousheng Talks About the Latest Situation in India After Completing His Lectures in India</h3>
<p>India is the birthplace of Buddhism but has no Buddhist flavor</p>
<p>Revolutionary leader Gandhi is now devoted to social movements</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yousheng, a teacher at Lida College in this city, was hired by the International University of India in the winter of the year before last to give lectures. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago after a year. According to his discussion, the latest situation in India is as follows:</p>
<p>Absolutely no Buddhist Flavor India currently has a population of 350 million. It is the birthplace of Buddhism. Since the Eastern Han Dynasty, Buddhism has gradually spread eastward to India in our country. But at present, there are no monks or nuns in India, and even the hometown of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, has absolutely no Buddhist flavor. Some say that the demise of India is related to Buddhism, but this is not the case. The reason why India was destroyed is entirely due to internal complexity, people's thoughts are not unified, and the people are like a pile of loose sand, which is even worse than our country.</p>
<p>The class system is very strict. The Indian class system is very strict, divided and subdivided. There are classes for laundry, classes for haircuts, up to thousands of kinds. All Indian commerce is manipulated by the British and has the center of political economy. India still has more than 120 small countries, each with a king. The British use these people to kill each other, so India is not destroyed by the British, but sent to the British by itself. As the saying goes, the country must first be attacked before others attack it. It is really a definite theory.</p>
<p>Gandhi's latest situation The Indian revolutionary leader Gandhi suddenly announced non-violentism in 1920. He has been working hard for more than ten years. The British are now very cruel to the Indians. The heads of various institutions are British, so the Indian revolutionary forces are all monitored by the British, so Gandhi has no choice. Now Gandhi has resigned from the chairmanship of the National Congress and is devoted to social movements, breaking the class system. Although the current environment in China is bad, it can still be done freely. Looking at the process of India's demise, as a reference for self-improvement and self-salvation, internal rectification is the only way to save the situation.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Will Stop Issuing Certificates for Elementary School Teachers' Qualification Examination</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education conducted the third elementary school teachers' qualification examination and the eighth elementary school teachers' registration last year. The examinations have been reviewed separately, and the results have been announced in the Shanghai Morning Post announcement column. Since the certificates and registration forms for the qualified candidates have been issued since November of last year, those who have come to the bureau to receive them have accounted for eighty to ninety percent. There are now few left. It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Education will set a deadline for issuing them in order to expedite the conclusion of the matter.</p>
<h3>Tongji University Grants Nocht Honorary Doctorate</h3>
<p>Hiring Dr. Fischer as Professor</p>
<p>Geheimrat Prot. Nocht, a famous scholar in the German medical community and an expert in tropical diseases, arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. Tongji University believes that his visit to China will inevitably lead to new inventions and special contributions to the evolution of medicine in our country, and he will hold a prestigious position in the history of medicine. On the afternoon of the 21st, a meeting was held at Tongji University Medical School, Baolong Hospital, to welcome him and invite him to give a speech. Dr. Weng Zhilong, the president of Tongji University, personally awarded him an honorary doctorate. Those who attended on that day were all people from the Chinese and Western medical communities. The title of his speech was "On Chemotherapy" and he had many new inventions. The audience was very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Weng Zhilong has been the president of National Tongji University, he has spared no effort in developing school affairs. He has paid special attention to recruiting well-known scientific experts in the academic community for the recruitment of professors. For example, Lai Luo, the dean of the School of Engineering, who was hired last year, is a German railway expert and former president of the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany. Recently, Professor Fischer from the University of Rostock in Germany was hired as professor of pathology at the Medical School. Fischer is a pathologist and one of the famous scholars in Germany. He has many writings. He was a professor at the school sixteen years ago. This time, he will make more contributions to the school. It is also reported that he arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and brought various pathological specimens and instruments collected from the University of Rostock. The school gave a very warm welcome.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>Dr. Marten has a famous saying to encourage young people. He said, "The creative process is actually a thing to train the will." Indeed, if we can take some time every day to think quietly for a while, and then slowly express the thoughts concentrated by ideals in words or in writing, I think this habit can easily increase the power of thinking.</p>
<p>Usually, we always do our work when we are happy, but this is not an economical way. It is best for us to have a fixed time every day to let our will develop freely, otherwise, we will often have to wait for the opportunity and get out of time and boring.</p>
<h3>Paper Blow</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>Whether it's boiling tea or cooking rice, using a paper blow to start a water pipe is essential. Without matches, a fire-starting stone was used, requiring paper blows. Therefore, households always had a fire-starting set in the kitchen, with flint, striker, and paper blow tube for extinguishing the fire. In the halls or studies, paper blow tubes filled with paper blows adorned the walls between calligraphy and paintings. Even the kerosene lamps made from glass bottles used in rural areas today use paper blows as wicks.</p>
<p>When I was little, I had two routine tasks for my father every day: washing the chamber pot in the morning and rolling paper blows in the evening. After dinner, I would review the day's readings and then roll paper blows. My mother would sit on the left side of the table sewing clothes, and my father would sit across from her, puffing and puffing on his water pipe. But my hands were rolling while my eyes were closing, and my head would be tapped by my father. Waking up, I would continue to roll because I couldn't sleep until I had rolled fifty of them.</p>
<p>In the nights before I left home to apprentice, my father said to me, "You are leaving home soon, roll me more. After you leave, I will have to roll paper blows myself." Over several evenings, I rolled several bundles and hung them on the nail for my father to use later. However, from the time I left home until my father's death, I never rolled a single paper blow for my father to use.</p>
<p>Upon entering the shop, I still had to wash the chamber pot for the masters in the morning and roll paper blows in the evening. But the paper blows I rolled were different. At home, I rolled rough straw paper with deckle edges. In the shop, the paper I rolled was fine and cut into oblique angles. I had to line it with a bamboo skewer when rolling. Under the guidance of my senior apprentice, I whittled a bamboo skewer myself, and I had to roll through a knife of paper before I could sleep each night.</p>
<p>I rolled paper blows every night. After three full years, I completed my apprenticeship and passed the task on to the new junior apprentice.</p>
<p>Today, by chance, I found my red-colored bamboo skewer that I had used to roll for three years at the bottom of a box, which made me recall that when my father was alive at home, he never had a chance to use paper blows rolled by his own son.</p>
<h3>Calling the Soul</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>The Chinese are a unique people, and therefore what they do is unique. Not to mention anything else, let's just talk about last year's "Women's National Goods Year". Although it was crowned with such a grand hat, from the results of the past year, we can know the unique situation of the Chinese people, especially those who wear this kind of mask to deceive people. But what kind of public opinion did they get? Needless to say, except for being attacked by them, there is nothing else to talk about. The reason why we Chinese are special is not because of the facts of "Women's National Goods Year" and so on.</p>
<p>Superstition in China is even more commonplace, is this almost so-called "special"? They put things made of clay sculptures and wood carvings in a curtain hanging with red silk, and kowtow and pray to it like ancestors. "Calling the Soul" is one of the superstitions of the Chinese. In the family, when a child is suddenly frightened, some will be stunned for a while, and some will even suffer a greater stimulus to the nerves and fall asleep. This is a very common thing. However, in the minds of us Chinese, we think that the soul has been frightened away, so there is this "Calling the Soul" performance: in the afternoon, a so-called "yuanbao" made of paper is burned, and the person shouts, "×× come back!" This continues to be called and burned. It is said that the patient will recover tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is the performance of the people of Shanghai. There are also the methods of our Ningbo people, who paste a paper crane on the mouth of a teacup, and drip cold water drop by drop on the paper crane, while shouting, "×× come back!" When a white thing appears on the paper crane, it is said that the patient's soul has been called back. Just imagine, a paper crane that is so thin that it cannot be thinner will naturally be affected by the pressure of water. However, it is no wonder that people call us a "special nation" because we special Chinese people can come up with such special things.</p>
<h3>Human Rickshaw Pullers in the Struggle for Survival</h3>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Not Good at Flattery, Begging for Help is Scolded, Unable to Return Home, Following Guests are Deceived by Exaggeration</p>
<p>Entering the room, the first thing that surprised Zhang Jiefu was that there were two stacks of snow-white, shiny silver dollars on the table. Although he didn't know how much money there was, judging from the pile, there were probably twenty or thirty yuan. He had just left this room and didn't see any money on the table. Now, two stacks of silver dollars were suddenly placed on the table, undoubtedly by him a minute or two ago. As he looked at the silver dollars, he simultaneously attracted the attention of the Hu family mother and daughter. Mrs. Hu was wondering why these two stacks of silver dollars were placed on the table. Could it be that this Master Jia was preparing to reward someone? Seeing that everyone was paying attention to the money, Jia Duocai leisurely placed the two stacks of silver dollars on the corner of the table and covered them with a piece of paper. Zhang Jiefu understood somewhat and deliberately chimed in: "Our Brother Jia is really rich, with whole stacks of silver dollars on the table." Jia Duocai laughed and said, "This is just a limited amount of money, what does it count for? To tell you the truth, if all the money that has passed through my hands were exchanged for silver dollars, I'm afraid that even if you piled up all the houses in Little Western Paradise, front, back, up, and down, it still wouldn't be enough." Zhang Jiefu nodded and said, "That's not a lie because Brother Jia is in this line of business." After saying these irrelevant words, Jia Duocai finally opened his mouth to greet Mrs. Hu: "Please sit down, please sit down, we can talk slowly." Mrs. Hu had never entered such a room. After she came in, besides feeling a lot of novelty like that day Yue Yingxiong came, she felt that this house was not a building, but her feet were still stepping on floorboards. Kneeling on it to do things would be much more comfortable than kneeling on a heated kang. So she stepped back two steps and sat on a low stool in the corner of the room. (143)</p>
<h3>Records of the Fragrant Imperial Scents</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"This time, on our way back, we must make the train go as fast as possible!" The Empress Dowager said to us anxiously, "No matter what place we pass through, we must not stop. Let them come to the station to greet us, we will just pretend we don't see them. We must not delay for them again!"</p>
<p>Listening to her say this, it can be seen that she herself was extremely anxious to go back. After living here for a few days, she probably felt very uneasy in her mind, as if she had been frightened. This is what I deduced from her tone. Maybe it's not like this, but at the time, none of those who heard her said anything that wasn't like my speculation. In short, the scenes in these ancient palaces in Fengtian were indeed too bleak and gloomy. No matter who lived in them, they would feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Okay! These two days have finally passed! We set off to return to Beijing on the morning of this day. Of course, although the Empress Dowager was anxious to go back and did not intend to accept other people's greetings and send-offs, people did not know that, and even if they knew, they had to do the formalities as usual. So that day, the station was still crowded with all the officials, big and small, in Fengtian; they were all sincerely there to see the Empress Dowager off. But the Empress Dowager got out of the sedan chair and did not stop at all. Supporting our shoulders, she hurriedly walked towards the car, as if there were pursuers chasing behind her, fearing that she would escape too slowly. Once she got into the car, she did not even bother to take a close look at whether everything in the car was complete. She hurriedly called people to order the train to start. Recalling when she came to Fengtian from Beijing, how leisurely and comfortable she was when she first boarded the train, but now she was so hurried and hasty. It was truly ridiculous? However, at that time, we also had the same guilty conscience as her, so we didn't find it ridiculous, unless the officials in Fengtian saw through our wolfish escape, they would inevitably laugh secretly.

<h3>Ingenious Trick for Calculating Birthdays</h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>The method is to use five pieces of paper, each divided into sixteen small squares. This is very simple. Draw four longitude and latitude lines on a piece of paper, and you'll form sixteen small squares, right? Then write on each sheet from left to right:</p>
<p>The first sheet is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31.</p>
<p>The second sheet is: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30, 31.</p>
<p>The third sheet is: 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
<p>The fourth sheet is: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
<p>The fifth sheet is: Write sequentially from 16 to 31.</p>
<p>After writing these down, you can apply them. Yes, as long as you tell me which of the five pieces of paper has your birthday on it, I can immediately answer your birthday on that day!</p>
<p>In fact, the usage is very simple, as long as you remember the numbers in the upper left corner of the sheets you say "yes" to, add them up and you'll get the answer. For example, say your birthday is the 26th (this is just an example, the rest is the same), then let's examine it now. The first sheet is "no," the second sheet is "yes," the third sheet is "no," and the fourth and fifth sheets are both "yes." This way we can add up the numbers in the upper left corners of the three sheets that are "yes," so it becomes 2 plus 8 plus 16, isn't this "sum" 26?</p>
<p>This trick for calculating birthdays was previously sold on the street. I think it's quite fun, so I don't mind being tedious and recording it to submit to this publication.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Love Once</h3>
<p>— Tao Hancui</p>
<p>In the past, Yi Yun always sat in his study, holding a book, and spending his day. Now, he is really afraid of sitting in the study, even more afraid than being pulled by his friends to sit in a teahouse in Xuanmiao Temple. The reason is that a family named Yu has moved in to live with him. This Yu family only has an old couple, both in their fifties or sixties, and they have no children to accompany them. The only things that came with them were an ugly maid and a black male cat that was almost starving to death.</p>
<p>The Yu family's living room and Yi Yun's study are only separated by a wall. The Yu family's mistress is a very hateful old woman. She seems to have forgotten that she is already an old woman with gray hair. Whenever she walks in front of people, she always twists and turns, as if she were a budding flower, which is really annoying to look at. The most hateful thing is that she always makes loud noises in her living room all day and night. Besides reciting the inferior monk's fake Sun Sutra upside down in the morning, she keeps arguing with that ugly maid. Sometimes she can even laugh and talk to herself, as if she is crazy. Yi Yun, sitting in the study next door, is often disturbed by her until he is dizzy and has blurred vision. Therefore, Yi Yun is now afraid of sitting in his study. He thinks that such an old woman is really a monster in the world. No wonder her husband often ignores her, and none of her relatives and friends ever come to visit.</p>
<p>Rarely, one afternoon, the old woman and her maid were too tired to argue. She finally went back to her bedroom on the left side of her living room to take a nap (this is the old woman's shared bedroom with the black male cat). The poor Yi Yun took advantage of this rare opportunity to quietly sneak into his study to flip through a few pages of books. Not even halfway through, Yi Yun suddenly heard a few charming groans coming from the old woman's bedroom. It was really the kind of groans of a young girl in her early teens waking up from a spring dream. Yi Yun was shocked to hear it. He didn't expect that an old woman of nearly sixty could still have such a miracle. It can be seen that the ugly maid in her house often scolds her as an old monster behind her back, probably not without reason. Yi Yun guessed that the old woman would definitely make a noise in the living room again after she woke up, so he hurriedly left the study, went out in a mighty manner, and went to the old bookstore stalls in Hulong Street to flip through old books.</p>
<p>Accidentally passing by a cold stall, he bought an old photograph of a beautiful woman in Qing Dynasty attire, with the words "A Glimpse of the Famous Flower Pei Hong in Wumen" written on the back. It turned out that Pei Hong was a famous courtesan in Suzhou forty years ago. This photograph was also taken incredibly adorably. The figure in the photo has an air of gorgeousness that one can never tire of looking at. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Gold Price Still Drops Twelve Yuan Under Central Bank's Support</p>
<p>Optimism Remains Elusive Despite Central Bank's Shift to Purchasing Futures</p>
<p>Excessive Looseness Erases Fleeting Gains in the Exchange Market</p>
<p>The gold market has been falling continuously for days without any end in sight. The central bank's vigorous release of physical gold was only able to partially reverse the trend. However, even though there was some recovery yesterday, the shift towards purchasing futures has brought back pessimism. Although there was a brief rebound midway, a catastrophic plunge was ultimately unavoidable. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw gains in London and stability in the US. There were both rises and falls in forward silver prices in Monte Video. London's raw gold fell by one and a half pence. Exchange rates rose slightly, creating unfavorable conditions for "big-footed" traders, with rumors of India posting bids at 0.0625 above the listed price. In the initial off-market pre-trading, offers opened at 84.5 yuan, with eager buyers pushing the price up to 7 yuan. When the central bank announced its rates, both British and American currencies rose, and the customs gold unit fell by 1.4%. The standard gold price dropped to 935.4 yuan. The market opened with a low, and although it stabilized slightly after opening, selling pressure remained latent, waiting for an opportunity to act. Chinese merchants, fearing a lack of selling appetite from banks, became more apprehensive. The exchange market hardened, and the downward trend intensified, gradually retreating into the 80 yuan range, with frequent dips. HSBC also raised its posted rates. Subsequently, when banks stepped in to buy on the cheap, prices rose to just outside the 80 yuan level, stabilizing sentiment. Chinese merchants then began to buy back, leading to a recovery. However, due to continued blockage by banks in hedging activities, and slight intervention in Sterling by the central bank, there was still a retreat. It was also rumored that the central bank continued to release physical gold, reportedly advancing futures at a price of one yuan above the market rate. Buyers in the market were unusually vigorous, and although sentiment was still normal, the excess of demand over supply led to heated competition. Small investors rushed to cover their positions, and the market then became lively, rising sharply. Unfortunately, the exchange market remained normal, and sellers were not yet active. At midday, the underlying trend weakened again, and the afternoon market also became sluggish. Subsequent dips were all pulled up by banks covering their positions. Although Indian silver rose, the central bank's release of physical gold at a price of 80 yuan caused a temporary rise. However, sentiment continued to be downward. When the banks stopped buying, selling pressure intensified again. The 80 yuan level was breached, and the banks also quickly stepped out, causing the exchange market to loosen dramatically. Buyers were helpless, fueling selling pressure. Despite some struggles, the downward trend remained very strong, although no new low prices were made. Finally, large holders covered their positions, and the market stabilized slightly after the dip. Examining the day's market conditions, it was still chaotic. Although the central bank intervened in the physical market, it might be exchanging gold for silver in London, as suggested by "big-footed" traders buying from China every day, which seemed reasonable. If so, silver prices would likely continue to rise, and the underlying sentiment would remain sluggish. The exchange market would loosen accordingly, and the outlook would remain difficult to be optimistic about. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 885.5 yuan, down 3 yuan from the previous closing. Dalian traders Hengyu entered at 6 yuan 8 jiao, and Hua Bi sold current Sterling at 8.75.

Knowing that HSBC would list a British rise of 0.25 and a US rise of 0.5 yuan, Yuan Mao Yong, Fuxing Yong, Heng Yu, Dalian traders, Yong Li, Heng Chang Yong, and others sold again, retreating to 76 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Changda bought in at low prices to 7 yuan 7 jiao. Fuan, Huixiang, Hengyu, and Yongli sold again to 6 yuan 7 jiao.

Dadecheng Qianchang Xiangheng Yu vigorously maintained the price, and it still rose. Yuan Maoyong Yuqing Yong Dafayong and small investors also entered, rising to 7 yuan 8 jiao. Wanxing Hengyu supplied at high prices, falling to 6 yuan 5 jiao. Qianchangxiang, Yicheng, Yongli entered to 8 yuan 7 jiao, Wanxing sold off, retreating to 6 yuan 7 jiao.

Dafayong Yifeng Yong Jinxiang Fuchang sold in unison, retreating to 4 yuan 6 jiao. Fuyu Hengyu entered for 6 yuan, Qianchangxiang Dafayong sold strips, falling to 4 yuan 2 jiao. Qingfayong and Chunyuanyong took in strips, rising to 7 yuan 8 jiao. Fuchang, Yuqing Yong, Hengyu Huixiang also came to buy. Tongtaichang, Yuliyongli, and Dingkang sold, falling to 886 yuan 1 jiao. After the market closed, it suddenly weakened, falling to around 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 983 yuan 6 jiao, then 3 yuan 7 jiao. Dalian traders, Qianchangxiang Hengyu Yuqing Yong Tongyu Run sold strips, retreating to 0.08 yuan. Youli bought March Sterling at 0.0875, Dafayong Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Ruixing Yongli came to enter, rising to 3 yuan 5 jiao. Fuxing Yong Fuan Huixiang sold strips, retreating to within 3 yuan. Fuyu Hengyu Yuan Maoyong sold even more, to 1 yuan. Dongfang bought June Sterling at 0.05625. Yongli Hengyu Yuanyi Qianchangxiang took in strips, rising to 4 yuan 2 jiao. Indian silver rose 4.4.4 anna. Hengyu Fuyu sold to 2 yuan 3 jiao. It was said that the central bank released 105 physical bars at a price of 80 yuan. Hengyu Fuyu Dadecheng entered to 4 yuan 8 jiao. Mitsui bought April US dollars at 38 yuan. Yongli Jinlong Hengchang Yongjiatai Dafayong Yuanmao sold, gradually retreating to 1 yuan. Futaiheng still entered, and mostly lingered around. Then, due to a misreport of Indian silver rising 3 anna, small investors sold off, and Dafayong also sold, falling to 79 yuan. In reality, Indian silver had not moved twice. Yongli Hengyu Yuqing Yong took in strips, rising to 81 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yong Yuankang Xiang Fu Sheng Yong Dalian traders vigorously sold Citibank, strongly selling April US dollars at 0.0125, falling to 77 yuan. Dadecheng and others still entered at low prices to 8 yuan 8 jiao. Fuyu Chunyuanyong Hongxing Yong Hong Kangyong came to sell strips vigorously, the domestic market was unusually strong, retreating to 6 yuan 8 jiao. Hengchang Yong Dalian traders came to enter, rising to 8 yuan 5 jiao. Fuyu Huixiang Dafayong Hongxing Hengxingyuan and others sold off, retreating to 5 yuan. At this point, limit-price buyers were trying their best to struggle. Huixiang Dadecheng Changda Yuqing Yong still had supply, and it fell to 3 yuan 3 jiao. Yuanmao Qianchangxiang Hengyu pushed hard, and the closing price rose to 876 yuan 5 jiao. After the market closed, Fuyu Yuanshengyong and others sold off, falling to within 5 yuan. Looking at the day's activity, the highest price was 888 yuan 8 jiao, the lowest price was 873 yuan 3 jiao, a difference of 15.5 yuan. As a result, it closed 12 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The settlement price was due to the central bank's standard gold price being lowered to 935 yuan 4 jiao. According to the closing price, it was about 59 yuan. More than 4 yuan lower than the previous closing. The March registration price was 880 yuan, and the April price was 886 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 868 yuan, and the after-market registration was 871 yuan. The April price was 877 yuan. The afternoon supplementary water was 859 yuan. The price of red gold was increased by 4 yuan, to 889.5 yuan. The physical market situation still had no development. The futures market continued to be downstream. Tianjin goods were about 7.5 yuan higher, lacking sellers. In general, the guest traders needed 9 yuan to buy, but there was a lack of supply. The central bank continued to release several hundred bars of physical gold, the price was around 3 yuan lower than the quoted price, the willingness to absorb was not as healthy as the previous market. However, there was a large purchase of April futures, reportedly at one yuan above the gold market price, or related to silver funds, the shift to futures is also unknown. The swap continued to fall, Yuan Maoyong posted 140 strips to Run Changyu at 4 yuan 1 jiao, Yuxin Xiang posted 14 strips, Tongyi posted 4 yuan, Wanxing posted 14 strips, Hengxing posted 7 strips, Dingtai posted 4.5 yuan, Yuan Yi posted 70 strips to Huixiang Dingtai each at 4 yuan, Hengxing posted 7 strips to Tongyi, Yongli posted 14 strips to Dingtai at 4 yuan.

There were 5,075 March strips left, with a total of 29 long parties and 12 short parties.</p>
<p>Trading within the market remained chaotic. In summary, Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, Qianchangxiang, Dacheng Hongxing, Dashun Ruikang Yuqing Yong Juchang Ruixing Yicheng Qingfayong Yifeng Yong Yongde and others were buyers, while Huixiang Fuxing Yong Dafayong Yuan Dayong Hengyu Lifeng Hanheng Hengchang Yong Yuan Yi Yuan Maoyong Dada Hongxing Shunli and others were sellers. Fuyu Dadecheng Fuxing Yong entered first and exited later. Shunli Wanxing Dafayong Hengyu exited first and entered later. Dalian traders and Wanxing did a total of over 2,100 strips, with a flat turnover. Shunli did a total of over 1,700 strips, with an excess of over 500 strips. Guangdong traders Hengxing Shengda still traded little. Dadecheng strongly entered nearly 3,000 strips. The total number of transactions on that day was 50,288 strips in the morning and 32,298 strips in the afternoon.

<p>The Exchange Market Still Hardens Overtly and Covertly</p>
<p>According to foreign news reports yesterday, London's "big-footed" traders rose recently by 0.25, and forward contracts by 0.1875. The market reported strength, saying that India bought at 0.0625 above the market price after closing. New York silver prices did not move. London's "big-footed" traders shrunk by one and a half pence. Sterling rose against the US dollar by 0.125, and the US dollar rose against Sterling by 0.375. Sterling rose against the French franc by one pound, and the US dollar rose against the French franc by 0.25. The exchange market opened in the morning, with recent selling prices for Sterling at one shilling six pence 0.08125, and for the US dollar at 38 yuan 0.0125, both unchanged from the previous closing. The central bank announced its rates, Sterling rose by 0.0125, the US dollar rose by 0.025, and the customs unit fell by 1.4%. Chinese merchants' sentiment was not strong, and the market opened with strength, at one point unusually strong. HSBC announced its rates, Sterling rose by 0.025, and the US dollar rose by half a yuan. After entering the market, Chinese merchants, seeing the central bank aggressively bidding on gold, and the gold market rebounding, suddenly had an appetite to buy, and the process tightened. There was considerable speculation in the process, which although tight, was fraught with uncertainty. The afternoon market reversed and hardened. Banks, taking advantage of cheap prices, maintained the market, and it stabilized. Although Indian silver rose by 4 anna, due to the central bank's release of physical gold, banks still bought. At this time, Chinese merchants' willingness to sell was still normal, and the overall trend was speculative. When the gold market fell again, banks also hurriedly sold off, and the process became significantly tighter. At closing, recent selling prices for Sterling were one shilling seven pence 0.0625, and for the US dollar 38 yuan 0.0625, Sterling loosened by 0.025, and the US dollar hardened by half a yuan, compared to the previous closing. Chinese merchants bought and then sold, and the turnover was about 670,000 pounds of Sterling and over 200,000 US dollars. British American Tobacco still had settlement payments, and Sassoon made slight covering purchases. A transaction record is provided below:</p>

<p>The Foreign Market Was Not Very Different</p>
<p>In recent days, the silver market has remained sluggish due to the inability to ease credit, and the market price for foreign exchange swaps remains at 9%, the same in the morning and afternoon, without any fluctuations for many days. Initially, the "draw head" was opened at 2%, but it was immediately changed to a "white draw" with no added water. The transaction of swap notes has still not been able to proceed as desired. It is estimated that the morning turnover was over 2.2 million, new transactions over 300,000, the midday turnover over 200,000, and the transaction in the small general association over 300,000. Over 400,000 in foreign currency pledge transactions were redeemed, over 800,000 in new transactions were made, over 400,000 in banknote transactions were recovered, over 700,000 were issued, and over 300,000 in code vouchers were collected, and over 400,000 were realized. Bank collections were also unusually sluggish. It is estimated that foreign banks collected over 1.6 million in note payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 3.2 million in various foreign exchange and miscellaneous payments, over 1.2 million in special foreign exchange payments, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 entered the warehouse. Chinese banks collected over 2.0 million in note payments, over 400,000 in special foreign exchange payments, over 4.1 million in various foreign exchange cargo and tax payments, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 left the warehouse. Japanese banks collected over 1.6 million in note payments, over 2.3 million in various cargo and foreign exchange miscellaneous payments, over 500,000 in special foreign exchange payments, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 left the warehouse. Money shops and foreign public offices collected over 24.0 million in foreign exchange, over 3.6 million in foreign exchange head payments, over 500,000 in various foreign exchange payments, 150,000 in customer sources, and 50,000 left. In addition, the total number of checks exchanged at the check clearinghouse was 30,028,543.08 silver dollars, including 9,065,556.75 silver dollars and 21,121,986.33 silver dollars exchanged by draft.</p>
<p>The Decline in Jiangjiao Has Not Ended</p>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in Jiangnan small foreign currency continued. The morning and afternoon prices were both 820 yuan, a further drop of 5 yuan from the previous day. Only 2,000 jiao were transacted in the morning, and none were reported in the afternoon. Guangdong small foreign currency was 734 yuan in both the morning and afternoon, a slight improvement of 4 jiao from the previous day. 155,000 jiao were transacted in the morning, and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were 330,000 thousand wen, a decrease of 1,000 wen from the previous day. The transaction amount was 32,340 strings of wen, equivalent to 9,800 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Record of February Bond Delivery</p>
<p>A Total of 41,155,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 26th, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange suspended trading for one day for the delivery of February futures. The total delivery amount was 41,155,500 yuan, of which 22,795,500 yuan was accounted for by brokers clearing accounts and making their own deliveries, and 18,360,000 yuan was delivered at the exchange. The financial sector and retail investors accounted for half of the buyers and sellers, respectively. The delivery quantity resulting from the "23rd Pass" storm was only 2,200,500 yuan, far less than other types. February futures were only traded for over 40 days, excluding holidays. The highest and lowest prices of various bonds generally ranged from 23 yuan to 45 yuan. The most significant factor during this period was the high daily foreign exchange swap rate and tight credit conditions, which gradually revealed cracks in the financial sector and fundamentally prevented prices from rising. Other factors, directly and indirectly, mostly originated from this. The problem in Chahar on January 18th was only a fleeting event and had no significant impact. However, the "23rd Pass" type had a difference of 11.7 yuan between the highest and lowest prices. The lowest price on January 21st was 70.04 yuan, and the highest price on February 18th was 82.1 yuan. Before February 8th, fluctuations were mostly limited to one or two yuan, maintaining a balanced state of just over 70 yuan or 71.2 yuan. From February 8th (the red plate of the Lunar New Year), the organization of a long position company began to manipulate and monopolize the market, and rumors abounded, leaving short sellers scorched. After the 18th, a certain bank's physical delivery of several million first caused the market price to collapse. This year's February futures on the 23rd have already been suspended, and the downward trend in March has not yet been curbed. Long positions are also scorched, and the market price has returned to a level. In this transition between high and low, a little carelessness can result in being caught in a whirlpool and being unable to extricate oneself. Future situations will be more on track. The delivery account clearing and total transaction numbers are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market is Uneven</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (25th), the New York stock market was sluggish and initially trending lower. However, due to short covering, the results were uneven. US Steel and Bethlehem Steel once reached their new lowest prices of the year. It is believed that this was due to the American Iron and Steel Institute's estimate that last week's steel production was only 47.9%, a decrease of 2.4% from the previous week. Railroad stocks were extremely weak, and several fell by as much as 5 yuan. Wall Street speculators paid close attention to silver. Today, London's "big-footed" traders rose to 25.5 pence, the highest price since 1929. This was due to a lack of physical silver in the East, increased purchases from India and China, and continued purchases from the United States. The bond market trended lower under the leadership of railroads. Small exchange stocks decreased slightly, with a total daily transaction of 740,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yarn Market, Long in Decline, Finally Sees Rebound</p>
<p>After eighteen consecutive days of decline, the yarn market is now showing signs of rebounding, prompting short sellers to cover their positions to realize profits. Meanwhile, some yarn mills, facing business difficulties, have yet to resume operations, significantly reducing production. Consequently, the market's selling pressure has eased slightly, with speculators buying cotton yarn and selling forward contracts to hedge their positions. As a result, the yarn market is stronger than the cotton market.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rises Above One Yuan: Spot market opening prices for cotton yarn contracts showed stagnation across all months, with limited trading activity and minimal price fluctuations. However, by the second and third trading sessions, cotton prices declined, dragging down yarn prices by five, six, or seven dimes. Prices rebounded by two or three dimes at the close, resulting in a net decrease of four dimes across all months. The afternoon session saw a sudden surge in market activity with numerous buyers, as tomorrow marks the settlement and market closure. To avoid risks after eighteen days of decline, many small investors covered their positions for overnight holding, causing a sharp rise in the current month contract by two yuan and one dime. Distant months rose by one yuan, two, three, five, and six dimes, respectively. Sales included 1,350 bales of Dafu, 1,150 bales of Jun Chang, 900 bales of Yuanda, 1,050 bales of Jinchang, 500 bales of Taixing, 400 bales of Yichang, 450 bales of Dachang, and 550 bales of Jifeng. Purchases included 1,350 bales of Dafeng, 850 bales of Suilong, 950 bales of Hexing, 800 bales of Tonghe, 550 bales of Tongji, 1,250 bales of Gengfeng, 700 bales of Renfeng, and 600 bales of Changfeng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Weak at 800 Bales: Spot yarn sales remain satisfactory. Statistics show that various buying groups purchased a total of 795 bales throughout the day, with prices similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Shows Signs of Recovery</p>
<p>After a sharp decline in the cotton market, prices are gradually rebounding. Given that prices have fallen by three yuan and four dimes compared to the end of last year, this rebound is expected. However, forward market prices remain sluggish, preventing most short positions from being actively covered and hindering a full market turnaround. Nevertheless, Yuanda and many sellers have switched from short to long positions. Market observers anticipate a rebound of one yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Forward Cotton Weak: The opening prices for forward cotton contracts showed a slight increase of two points for American cotton and a decrease of 0.05 rupees for Indian cotton. The market remained dispersed, with prices fluctuating across all months. However, bulls appeared skittish. The opening trading session was flat, and selling pressure intensified in the second and third sessions, with bears engaging in aggressive selling, pushing prices to new lows across all months. However, large traders covered their positions at the close, resulting in a rebound of 1.5 dimes. Consequently, all months experienced a net decrease of two to two and a half dimes. The afternoon session saw a sudden tightening of market sentiment, with buyers rushing in. Bears realized profits and increased their purchases, resulting in an increase of 1.5 to 3 dimes across all months. Sales included 2,700 bales of Dafu, 2,500 bales of Senkang, 2,500 bales of Tongxing, 1,400 bales of Yichang, 1,300 bales of Changfeng, 2,100 bales of Shengyuan, 2,800 bales of Tongji, 1,600 bales of Jinchang, 2,300 bales of Runkang, 2,100 bales of Yuanxingchang, and 1,900 bales of Changhe. Purchases included 2,400 bales of Suilong, 2,400 bales of Yuanda, 1,600 bales of Shenchang, 1,900 bales of Shenji, 2,000 bales of Runkang, 3,300 bales of Gengfeng, 4,400 bales of Changfeng, 1,800 bales of Xiecheng, 1,600 bales of Shengyuan, 1,500 bales of Chong'an, and 1,300 bales of Yifeng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Limited Factory Demand: Spot cotton consumption remains sluggish, with factories making only sporadic purchases.</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 40.25 Shenxin Factory Purchase 300 Bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Donggou Cotton 40.60 Shenxin Factory Purchase 300 Bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 44.25 Donghua Factory Purchase 100 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 43.65 Yongan Factory Purchase 150 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 43.25 Yongan Factory Purchase 105 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>American Cotton Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton futures opened lower, with the March contract closing positions and all months falling by two to five points. Subsequently, due to purchases by peers in Japan, Liverpool, and New Orleans, a rebound occurred. Trading throughout the day mostly shifted from March to July. For new cotton from distant months, industry players are awaiting government policy decisions on new cotton, resulting in a firm market. Prices stood above the previous day's low point. Spot prices remained unchanged at the close, while futures prices fluctuated by one to two points. The Cotton Exchange estimates that from August 1 to January 31, global consumption was 12,384,000 bales, compared to 12,702,000 bales in the same period last year. Within this, American cotton consumption was 5,883,000 bales, compared to 7,100,000 bales in the same period last year. The British cotton market was weak, with current futures falling by three points. There were some speculative purchases of Indian cotton, with Pingguoer falling by one rupee, and Aomula and Bailuoxi falling by 0.25 rupees. Originally reported from Delhi (25th dispatch).</p>
<p>According to a report from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 26th is 247 rupees, a decrease of 1.5 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Attached is the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon:</p>
<p>According to a report from Bombay on the 25th, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 7,755 bales, with 200 bales going to Liverpool and 7,555 bales going to Kobe.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour Futures Hovering, Near Term Stable, Distant Months Soft</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices initially flat, then rise, and finally rise and fall in both the morning and afternoon sessions. With foreign wheat quoted at only four cents better in Chicago and around 48 cents better in Canada, the opening prices were influenced by the rebound in gold prices at the close of the previous day. This led to short covering, stabilizing the market. Although the current month's contracts remained weak, spot goods were tight, giving a sense of stability. Distant months also rebounded by varying amounts of one to two cents due to short covering. As the afternoon session opened, the market was initially stable but turned down as long positions for the current month were sold, and distant months were affected by the re-entry of the gold market and speculative short selling. Some factories also released small amounts of stock. Given the instability of exchange rates, there are concerns about further declines. Consequently, the current month improved by half a cent compared to the previous day, March to May improved by 2.5 li, June fell by one cent, and July fell by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Generally Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market remained quiet in the morning session. With foreign wheat quoted at only around 48 cents better, only March and April contracts saw trading, with limited buyers hindering market enthusiasm. Prices initially fell by one to two cents but then stabilized. As the afternoon session opened, prices for all months rose in response to the strengthening of the flour market in the morning. However, with the gold market fluctuating, the future outlook remains uncertain. Consequently, March rose by five cents, and April rose by four cents. The spot wheat market remains stable, with limited inventory making short selling difficult. Guidet Wheat was sold for 3.85 yuan per dan through Xinda.</p>
<p>River Rice Sales Sluggish, Falling by Dimes</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various groups continued to be scarce, with only about twenty suppliers (totaling over 4,000 shi). Sales in this area remained sluggish, with only Baowei handling over 1,000 packages from the Qingdao and Yantai groups. Therefore, it is difficult to turn around the sluggish market. The issue of tight credit has also made people anxious, leading to a generally weak situation. Prices for higher-quality japonica rice continued to fall by dimes, while late rice fell by several fen to dimes. Dujian has not yet opened, and the market continues to soften (North Shanghai). Yesterday's weather was overcast and humid. About 20 to 30 boats arrived from various routes. Sales of all types of goods were sluggish. Prices for mid-grade and lower-grade white japonica rice and early rice fell by one to two dimes, while higher-quality thin rice fell by a few fen and lower-quality thin rice fell by dimes. Yinyuan rice fell by one dime, and other prices also weakened.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice and Second-Grade Foreign Rice Stable</p>
<p>— Arrivals Uninterrupted, Sentiment Very Weak —</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was very soft due to ample inventory and continuous arrivals. Most orders were placed for February and March, and January orders have not yet been fully fulfilled, with February orders arriving in succession. Therefore, arrivals occur daily, but demand has not increased, leading to an increasingly lifeless market. Yesterday, 4,500 bags of Saigon rice, 2,500 bags of Siamese rice, and 500 bags of Xiaojiao rice were offered, totaling only 7,500 bags, while new arrivals reached tens of thousands daily. However, No. 3 rice and broken rice were in short supply and demand was strong, leading to a temporary stabilization. No. 1 and No. 2 rice are still being watched with a negative outlook. Yesterday, local and inland groups took advantage of low prices to load up on customer xian rice, stabilizing the market. Total offers were less than 1,000 bags, but with dwindling inventory and uncertain future shipments, sentiment and the market have stabilized.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Two Reasons for Watching the Rise of Chaoqing Sugar</p>
<p>Shantou Exchange Rate Drops to 34 Yuan Ground Price Rises by Two Dimes</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the domestic Chaoqing sugar market, Shantou land prices rose by two dimes, and the Shantou exchange rate fell by 33 to 34 yuan, effectively adding 30 to 40 cents to the cost. With low inventory at the source, spot prices are very firm, and suppliers are cautiously reducing sales, offering only over 200,000 dan. High-quality Huanggang Qing sugar is priced at 10.30 yuan, and lower-quality sugar is priced at 9.80 yuan. Current costs, including transportation, already require 11.23 yuan per dan for Qing sugar and 10 yuan for Longqing sugar, resulting in excessive losses. Future prices are expected to rise, which seems certain. Hainan red sugar saw sporadic transactions at 10.60 yuan. The association's clearing prices for coarse sand white sugar for spot goods saw no transactions. Slightly coarser imported sugar was priced at 4.95 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar B Mark was priced at 18.05 yuan, a decrease of five fen. This factory's cotton white Zhenyu No. 1 was priced at 16.70 yuan, No. 2 at 16.60 yuan, No. 3 at 16.45 yuan, and No. 4 at 16.30 yuan, a decrease of one dime. Zhenji small package No. 1 ice sugar was priced at 21.40 yuan, and No. 2 at 21.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Scrap Iron Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>Scrap iron sales have decreased significantly due to rural bankruptcy and tight credit. The market is experiencing oversupply. Due to the slack market, there is significant selling pressure. Yesterday's market prices were estimated at 4.40 yuan for original word plates, 4.35 yuan for narrow strips, 5.60 yuan for five-li square blocks, 5.10 yuan for seven-and-a-half-li, 4.80 yuan for one- and two-fen, 4.50 yuan for thick patterned, and 4.23 yuan for small square blocks. It is reported that only 300 to 400 dan were traded yesterday, purchased by groups from Sichuan and Hankou. There were no transactions from Ningbo, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin. Local industry players are finding sales difficult and are increasingly bearish. The market is expected to continue to weaken.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Listen to Lytton's Tune</h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, Lord Lytton, bearing the responsibility of resolving the "Manchurian Problem," made a trip to the Far East. Subsequently, he returned to Geneva and published the so-called "Lytton Report," aimed at "maintaining peace in East Asia." Afterward, news about him gradually diminished in newspapers.</p>
<p>In the investigation report, Lytton advocated that Manchuria should be jointly managed internationally, not exclusively by Japan. Naturally, Japan would not agree to this proposal. Who would willingly give up the fat they had already tasted? Even a three-year-old would know that this was futile. Consequently, Lord Lytton faced a rebuff in Geneva, and Japan withdrew from the League of Nations under the principle of "non-recognition of Manchukuo" by various countries.</p>
<p>Recently, Lytton reiterated his views on the Manchurian problem in the United States. In fact, these views remain the same old tune as those in the investigation report three years ago: still "requesting Japan's cooperation" and encouraging everyone (imperialists) to "jointly develop Manchuria."</p>
<p>Of course, under the principle of not harming Japan's interests in Manchuria, Japan welcomes investment from various countries. Even Lytton acknowledges that "Japan should be given considerable understanding regarding its handling of the Manchurian Incident" This so-called understanding naturally refers to Japan's special position in Manchuria. Japan's special position in Manchuria is precisely due to the creation of the puppet "Manchukuo" through military force.</p>
<p>"Lytton continued, stating that the League of Nations' handling of the Manchurian Incident was not a failure because the League's policy was primarily criticism, not the use of military force to enforce its beliefs" (Eleventh Washington National News dispatch). In fact, the League of Nations' reputation was long tarnished by Japan. Lytton's talk of success or failure is pointless. What pretense can still be salvaged? "Finally, Mr. Lytton believed that although Japan could develop Manchuria through peaceful means, Japanese troops must be withdrawn to maintain the goodwill of all countries in the world" (Eleventh Washington National News dispatch). Lytton's hope for Japan to withdraw troops is certainly unrealistic, but Lytton is not a fool and knows that Japan will not withdraw its troops. However, on the international stage, the tune must be loud enough to garner sympathy. In reality, they have other intentions. Haven't recent reports revealed that Britain will send a commercial delegation to Manchuria?</p>
<h3>Old Man Fu</h3>
<p>— Lini</p>
<p>Old Man Fu's departure and the arrival of a strange middle-aged woman at his small, humble earthen house, panting like an overworked ox and sobbing softly leaning against the doorway, spread throughout the village. It aroused the curiosity of all the women in the village and the malicious glee of the children, who all gathered at his door to watch the spectacle, surrounding the small earthen house.</p>
<p>Old Man Fu had a limp in his right leg, and his left shoulder swayed back and forth as he walked. It was said that he got this limp when he was young and got into trouble for stealing a woman. He—around forty years old—had a small, rotten pumpkin-like head with most of his hair gone, leaving a bald spot on top that looked like a flat piece of wax stone. His thin, triangular face had a pair of weasel eyes and thick, dark lips with a few gray cat whiskers on his upper lip. Although his appearance wasn't particularly handsome, his lips always wore a friendly smile, regardless of whether it was winter or summer, which made people feel close to him.</p>
<p>Ever since Old Man Fu had come to the village, the village's celebrations and funerals had been entrusted to him. Today he would be asked by someone to pick up the bride's sedan chair, tomorrow someone else would ask him to report a death to relatives. These had become Old Man Fu's specialty. At the same time, he was particularly more experienced and thorough than others in these matters. Therefore, the village people couldn't do without Old Man Fu whenever something happened.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when Old Man Fu was still young, the people in the village seemed to be richer than they were now, and they were particularly willing to spend money and make a grand display of their celebrations and funerals! They would invite guests for at least ten or eight days, making so much noise that even the chickens and dogs in the house wouldn't be at peace. This meant that Old Man Fu didn't have to cook for himself at home. He was called to help out and received five cents a day, plus a lot of "extras" and "grease" from the guests. His pockets were filled, and his two weasel eyes smiled even more narrowly.</p>
<p>Old Man Fu had no other hobbies except for drinking a cup or two of "white liquor" every day. Even women, whom he had loved when he was young, now seemed to disgust him. Since he drifted into the village, his attitude had become very proper and serious, and he had never caused any trouble over women. Because of his shrewdness and diligence, he had saved some money over the years and lent it to people in the village who were starting small businesses, earning a little interest each year.</p>
<p>After he finished his work during the day, he would drink his "white liquor" and, with a bit of a buzz, slowly drag his half-worn silk shoes, which were given to him by someone he had helped, and leisurely go to the stone steps in front of the ancestral hall to cool off and watch the evening clouds in the sky. At this time, those on the steps who were about the same age as him would always say to him in a half-serious, half-joking tone!</p>
<p>"Old Fu, why don't you find a woman? Are you going to live like a monk your whole life?"</p>
<p>"Women... disgusting things!" He would look at the sky, roll his weasel eyes full of red veins, and then close his eyelids tightly. "It's so clean like this, wo...men!" His voice was too slow, with a sense of regret, as heavy as lead.</p>
<p>"Haven't you already had a woman before?" Those people seemed to be deliberately probing into his origins.</p>
<p>"Why is the weather so stuffy! If the heavens don't send rain, it's really going to suffocate people." Old Man Fu would change the subject, and so, cleverly, their topic would turn to the weather.</p>
<p>The news of Old Man Fu's sudden departure and the arrival of a middle-aged woman sobbing softly in his small earthen house caused a stir in the peaceful village, with everyone making mysterious speculations.</p>
<h3>Hanging</h3>
<p>— Rui Zhi</p>
<p>"Zhou Ruisheng's grandmother hanged herself at home last night."</p>
<p>This news spread throughout the village early in the morning. Then all kinds of discussions spread through the streets and alleys of the village.</p>
<p>"Zhou Ruisheng has three brothers, and they still let their old mother hang herself."</p>
<p>"In these times, it's better to be dead than alive and suffering. Dying is cleaner."</p>
<p>"It's like a plague. Since the new year began, a lot of people have died in this village. Starvation, freezing, drowning, hanging, everything is happening."</p>
<p>"The heavens are blind. In this bad year, how can people survive?"</p>
<p>These kinds of discussions were heard everywhere in the alleys. Some were scolding Zhou's three brothers for being unfilial, not even being able to support an old mother. Some were cursing the heavens and the ghosts, saying they didn't protect living beings. But there were also some who knew that it was the bad year that caused it, or that it was a fate determined by heaven. And there were even some who were used to it and didn't think it was a big deal. In short, everyone had an opinion, whether right or wrong, and everyone was discussing it. The usually quiet village was stirred up by Zhou's family's affair.</p>
<p>Cheng Laobo from the Cheng Family Ancestral Hall was awakened by the Zhou family's death early in the morning. Listening to the mixed discussions of the women in the alley, he became impatient. After eating a bowl of very thin porridge, he went out alone.</p>
<p>Cheng Laobo was over seventy years old, and there were only a few people in the village who were about his age. So he knew everything about the village, who was good, who was bad, which family was doing well, which family was poor. He knew all these things in detail. As for the good and bad years, and the number of deaths in the village, he had seen a lot and was almost tired of it. But a bad year like last year, with people dying one after another, was the first time he had seen it in all his years.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, the voices of the conversations at the alleyway still pierced his ears sharply. Although he found the people who were talking annoying, he could only walk along silently. His feet were walking, but his mind was thinking:</p>
<p>"Damn it, these young people and girls, what are they talking about, death after death? They can't explain anything, but they have to talk to death. What business is it of theirs that someone's old woman died, just making a fuss. In these times, what does it matter if someone dies, even if ten more die, it's the same thing."</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more unhappy he became, and the voices of the conversations by the roadside seemed even sharper. He finally made it out of the village gate.</p>
<p>The fields outside the village gate were silent, with only the dry leaves and branches under the trees rustling a little in the wind. Cheng Laobo stood on the ridge at this time, the sun shining on his face, and the wind blowing his white beard. He felt a natural comfort in his heart. He looked at the vast fields in front of him, with the soil plowed loosely, and he guessed that this year's harvest would be good.</p>
<p>He stroked his face, twirled his beard, and a smile appeared on his face as he walked back and forth on the ridge. Thoughts flooded his mind one after another. He thought:</p>
<p>"This year's harvest should be better, right? I've lived this long, and I've never seen such a famine as last year, with so many people starving to death, freezing to death, and committing suicide. Those young people always talk about death when they hear about it, without thinking about doing anything serious, really..."</p>
<p>As he thought, he looked at the endless field of soil that had been plowed loosely, and his mind turned. He frowned and muttered to himself:</p>
<p>"Huh! The fields that were plowed last year weren't as loose as this!? But..."</p>
<p>His heart sank, and he couldn't help but think of Zhou Ruisheng's grandmother's suicide.</p>
<h3>All Livelihood</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Fond Memories of Old Dreams</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Over there, at the end of the sea, under the green coconut trees of the South Island, once were imprinted my pale, traceless, light dreams, the lingering, hesitant silver traces of love. In my dreams, I deeply savored the passion of flower-like, fragrant, tender blood-red lips! Lying quietly among the shadows of the leaves, I listened to the gentle melodies that young girls sang, melodies that flowed like the wind through their youthful voices. The young girls had captivating eyes that gave me beautiful, dream-like fantasies. Their eyes brewed poetic secrets of maidenhood, often immersing me in a blissful, forgetful state. But because of the heavy gift of love, I worried that I didn't have the capacity to bear it, and instead, I felt an inexplicable anxiety and melancholy.</p>
<p>The dream eventually fell like a star that twinkles once and then plummets from the sky. The beautiful dream has turned into black smoke, into shattered fragments of scattered fallen leaves. Now, in the grim recollection, I silently pick up the faded and broken remnants of the past, but they can no longer offer me any comfort. It is like stabbing a wounded heart with another sudden knife. Beyond that, I can only endure immense sorrow, watching helplessly as the last drops of youth's rich nectar flow away.</p>
<p>The strings of the zither are broken, the soft sounds are gone. What can I still see, what can I still hear? During the long days, my eyes are filled with misty tears. All happiness has been surrendered to the well of tears and sighs.</p>
<p>I originally wished that all the past would forever be thickly covered by the dust of time, never again having the heart to pursue it, lest I needlessly invite some embarrassing stings. But because my heart is not completely dead, how could I simply abandon the old dreams that once caused my life to tremble greatly and be deeply intoxicated? However, when I ignite the memory of the past, which seems both blurry and clear, I suddenly feel like I am losing consciousness. My body sways in mid-air like a kite with a broken string, completely scorched by the invisible flames of memory.</p>
<p>Knowing that the vanished joys cannot be pursued and the lost beautiful figures cannot be called back, just as fallen raindrops can never fly back to the sky. Yet, I stubbornly try to listen to the light singing of orioles and search for the colors of fresh green flowers in this deep autumn when the autumn wind has blown the flowers and leaves from the trees.</p>
<p>Where on this vast earth can I go to find my old dreams? The sky is so high and distant, the sea is so boundless, and the journey is so long and remote, like a misty, remote South Island dream! You, young girl, your feelings are truly as unpredictable as the weather at sea. It was so difficult for me to meet you, so much effort I used, but losing you was so easy. You quietly left without even looking back. Do you know that the person who was once so close to you all day long has become a wanderer in a foreign land? Although in the meantime, I have become indifferent to all the worldly splendor, the only thing I cannot become indifferent to is you. I still think of you every day! The impression you gave me was too profound. Although ruthless time has draped my life in gray robes, you always have a graceful and delicately beautiful face with a light smile, which is still clearly engraved in my heart, like a golden statue that cannot be destroyed. Therefore, I am mired in a prison from which I cannot escape. Now I am listlessly passing the years without joy or hope, staggering along the long road of wandering, singing the death knell of my own life. I don't feel a bit of regret, nor do I blame anyone. Everything that is worthy of boasting no longer belongs to me, just as the young girl already belongs to someone else. However, there will be a day when everything about you, young girl, will also not belong to you, and you will feel the loneliness of life.</p>
<p>But I bless you that you will not have such days. The sweet and painful souvenir you have given me is already a generous gift.</p>
<h3>Wandering News</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Our hometown is a solitary island standing amidst turbulent waves. It is surrounded by water, with no land routes for access. However, the water routes are only served by a few civilian boats.</p>
<p>There are beautiful scenery and famous historical sites. Emperor Qianlong visited the island during his tour of Jiangnan. Now, the Dragon Cave and Stone Elder Mountains, like the Lion Grove and Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou, are still forbidden from quarrying stones after his imperial decree, and the imperial inscriptions are still clearly visible on the stone walls. The lives of the villagers are very simple, and their customs are very honest and kind. Among the people who grew up on this solitary island, at least ninety-five out of a hundred have never left the province, and some have never even left the island. Since the Taiping Rebellion, this place has not suffered from war, and the villagers live in peace and contentment, considering it a paradise on earth. There are also very rich local products, but since the continuous natural disasters in recent years, this solitary island is not as prosperous as it once was!</p>
<p>On this solitary island, which is thousands of miles in circumference, people live scattered in groups of three or five families. Sometimes, there are only desolate wildernesses for ten or twenty miles, and no human habitation can be found. But sometimes, after walking only three or five steps, there is a village. Most people make a living by farming, but in recent years, many have gone to the docks to engage in commerce.</p>
<p>There are no postmen here. The post office hires a villager to deliver messages for ten yuan. This person who delivers letters is called the "Wandering News". Every morning, he carries a package and sends the letters he collected along the way the night before to the branch office (the so-called branch office is just a grocery store with a sign hanging in front of it that says "Agency for selling stamps", which is subsidized by the county post office). The letters are then transported to the county office by civilian boat. He then distributes the letters from the branch office. For each letter delivered, he receives six copper</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>coins. Postcards and newspapers are half-price. This can be considered an extra expense for the recipient. However, in one respect, the sender can take advantage of a small benefit: letters sent within the island do not need to be stamped; he will deliver them himself and collect the porterage fee from the recipient.</p>
<p>For letters sent to distant places, he does not deliver them on the same day. He waits until he has several letters before delivering them together, so it is possible that a letter may take seven or eight days to be received.</p>
<p>He passes by our house, usually around seven o'clock in the morning, but in the afternoon it is only around dusk.</p>
<p>"Wandering News, how are you? Are you still delivering news?" When he delivered a letter this time I returned home, I couldn't help but ask him this.</p>
<p>"Yes, who would want to do this bitter job?" He says it's a bitter job, but in reality, there are many people who envy this bitter job!</p>

<h3>Hollywood's Special Academy That Emphasizes Triple Education and Intellectual Instruction (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhujia Bo</p>
<p>If the reader suspects that teaching such young children to practice public speaking or recite poems is appropriate, Lucy Greer has an amazing record to show you. She can prove that first-grade students can recite more than 400 lines of poetry each year, and can devise and deliver their own speeches once a week. They do not have any problems with shyness or panic in front of a large audience. Furthermore, these children are extremely fond of going on stage to speak or recite in front of the public. This practice of memorization and public speaking is uninterrupted from first grade to ninth grade. Therefore, self-awareness, or mental uneasiness in front of the public, is virtually non-existent among trained Curtis students.</p>
<p>During the primary school period, Jimmy's lunch must be eaten at school. He can learn many good eating habits during the year. The school has food experts and doctors. After they have prepared Jimmy's menu, they make slight additions and subtractions to what everyone usually eats to suit the needs of each child. For example, when Jimmy ate lunch at school for the first time, he saw milk on his plate. He hated milk the most. He also saw vegetables, which he also hated the most. He felt very unhappy. But there was also a large roast leg of lamb, fruit, and a piece of cake on the plate. He only ate what he liked. He kept looking at his teacher, Lucy Greer. He was afraid she would condemn him, but she didn't pay any attention to him, which made him feel strange. He didn't have that kind of freedom at home.</p>
<p>But soon, he saw other children often going to the kitchen to ask for a second glass of milk. There were also children who were hungry during class and specially asked for leave to go get milk to drink. He felt that milk must be a good thing. So, unknowingly, he gradually began to drink milk. Eating vegetables was also a gradual process. Before they got used to eating vegetables, Lucy Greer made them eat juicy vegetable soups or salads, so that they would get the same vitamins A, B, and C. But according to Lucy Greer, ordinary children like to gnaw on radishes, celery, or eat spinach.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year, Jimmy could already say a few words in French and could swim back and forth in the pool. His sloping shoulders were also straightened, and the arches of his feet were gradually rising. His weight had also reached equilibrium. He had his body checked once a month and his mouth checked by a dentist every four months. By the fourth grade, he began to learn to box, had to be able to take a punch to the face without shedding a tear. He also practiced the 25-yard dash. He also learned the correct posture for playing tennis. He was no longer afraid of horses and liked riding. He also dared to lean back and jump into the water. He had also become an expert in social dancing. He could also somersault, do tiger jumps, or walk on his hands. He also learned water rescue work. In addition, baseball, football, etc. were all things that every male student should know.</p>
<p>There was also a drama class there, which every student liked to join. Charlie Chaplin's two sons, Charles and Sydney, and Lawrence Tibbett's two twins, Lawrence and Richard, were children endowed with performing talent.</p>
<p>If Jimmy had a sister, her physical training after entering school would be exactly the same as Jimmy's, except for boxing. But women, in addition to boxing, added a lot of flexibility work, stage dance, archery, and indoor basketball.</p>
<p>When Apricot entered the seventh or eighth grade, she had gradually become interested in literature or poetry. And, beyond his mother's expectations, he was able to appreciate Shakespeare. Fortunately, the professor who taught Jimmy Shakespeare was not a scholar who only took things out of context or specialized in textual research. After explaining it in simple and extremely precise language, he asked each student to play a role in the play. In this way, they gained a deeper understanding of Shakespeare's works!</p>
<p>Of course, the curriculum of the Curtis School includes everything that a middle school should have. Students graduating from Curtis School can directly enter the highest-level university. All the courses there, whether science or literature, are very profound and rigorous, although each student must choose a major that is close to his nature, such as botany, biology, or geology. For example, Jimmy is already in the ninth grade. He chose to major in geology, so that when he goes to university, he can directly enter the university's geology class. Or, if he does not go to university, he can also work as a geological surveyor in an oil mining company.</p>
<p>The above does not describe all the work of the Curtis School in creating a good citizen. The more important work of the Curtis School is to train children's politeness, self-control, and make them reliable and useful citizens. He must learn to respect the rights of others, be tolerant, and be able to get along with others. He has learned a skill to convince people in the nine years of public speaking practice, so that when they enter the world in the future, they will not be despised as a dandy who cannot distinguish between beans and wheat.

<h3>Joan Crawford Describes Her Ambition to Perform on Stage</h3>
<p>— Xifu</p>
<p>Joan Crawford recently built a small theater in her Brentwood Heights residence, next to the swimming pool. The roof is white, and the walls are made of unpainted wooden boards, simple and chic. It carries a mysterious air, because although people are talking about it outside, no one has been inside. One of Joan's old classmates went to see it and asked her what it was for. Joan told her that she wanted to perform on stage there during her free time in between filming. The following are the reasons why she wants to perform on stage:</p>
<p>She said: "I can't be a movie star forever. To be worthy of myself, I must ask for development. I need a lot, and stage experience is one of them." Joan herself criticized herself and said: "I lack the ability to be confident. I don't have a peaceful attitude. I often feel sorry for myself. Often during screenings, I can't eat all day. By the time the movie is screened, I'm almost a wreck. I must find a way to correct this problem. I can only find a way from the stage. I'm not seeking fame, I want experience."</p>
<p>"But where does the time come from? According to my contract, I have to film three movies a year. The company has the right to ask me to film one more, for a total of four. One movie may take as long as five months to film. When the second movie starts, I have no prior notice. So, although I want to perform on stage, I don't have time to perform, and I don't have time to practice. Therefore, I can only practice and rehearse at home first. That is, during the free time between filming, gather a few close friends and rehearse plays at home." According to Joan, she likes to perform historical plays. Or the first play she rehearsed was "Joan of Arc."</p>
<p>"What else?" her friend asked. This question revealed Joan's even greater ambition. She not only wants to perform historical plays on stage, but also wants to perform operas. She practices singing for one hour every day. Her throat is extremely wide, with a range of three octaves. She has to practice her voice at six o'clock in the morning and at lunchtime. She said: "I will sing in the second movie. That's the first time in my life. Would you like to listen?" As she said that, she took out a few records and put them on the record player. Sure enough, the tone was melodious and pleasant, which surprised her old classmate.</p>
<p>Joan was originally an ambitious woman. What was she twelve years ago? What was she? Probably many people know, five or six years ago, she was just an ordinary dancer. But she is full of ambition and constantly trains herself. Now she is a very popular superstar. Since she has this ambition to perform on stage and even go to the opera house, who can stop her? She is only twenty-five or six years old now, and her future is still bright, so let's wait and see.</p>
<h3>Constant Arrival of British Films: "Rome Express" Scheduled to Premiere Soon</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that British films have made great strides recently. Judging from film publications from various countries, they have already occupied the most advantageous position in the global film market. Although there are not as many British films shown in Chinese cinemas as American films, several of them made quite a splash in the past year.</p>
<p>"Endless Spring," recently shown at the Cathay Theatre, is also a production of the British film giant Gaumont Company, and its success is already well known. Following this film, "Rainbow Melody," managed by Universal Films, will be released successively.</p>
<p>The star is Cicely Courtneidge, who has already met Shanghai audiences in films such as "Peach Blossom Village," "Apricot Blossom Village," and "Spring in the Willow River." Cicely Courtneidge and Sonny Hale, the stars of "Friday the Thirteenth," are also the protagonists of "Endless Spring." In addition, there are many other films that I cannot introduce all at once.</p>
<p>Also, two famous works that were once shown at the Grand Theatre and the Lyceum, such as "Spring in the Willow River," "The Iron Blood of Rouge," and "Dreams of Wealth and Spring," will continue to be shown in Shanghai. It is also heard that the Carlton Theatre is scheduled to premiere "Rome Express" starting on Wednesday. This film is known as the "Grand Hotel" of Europe and is certainly a masterpiece worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Lianhua News</h3>
<p>Lianhua's participation in the International Film Exhibition held in Soviet Russia was directly invited by the Soviet side in advance, so the Lianhua representative has already attended on schedule.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Xiong Xiling is a director of Lianhua. When Mr. Xiong and Ms. Mao Yanwen were married at their residence in Shanghai, Lianhua's news department also filmed the news.</p>
<p>Lianhua's blockbuster "Serpent Beauty," which is about to be released at the Jincheng Grand Theatre in Shanghai, is Yang Xiaozhong's sensational work after "A Fine Night." The filming of this film took a very long time and cost a lot. Because cars were used in the play, more than 150 vehicles were borrowed from the Xiang Sheng Motor Company. In addition, the quality of the location shooting in Zhenjiang and the Anhui-Zhejiang Highway was also very high.</p>
<p>"National Customs," co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shilin, is rich in social education significance.</p>
<p>Playwright Yu Shangyuan went to Russia to study drama and passed through Shanghai. He visited Lianhua and had a very long conversation with Ruan Lingyu about film and drama.</p>
<p>The comedy "Carefree Gentleman," co-directed by Zhuang Guojun and Shen Fu, previously filmed Mei Lin marrying Han Langen one minute after another, and then marrying Liu Jiqun. Recently, another more interesting scene was filmed, in which Han actually married Liu two minutes after Mei married Liu, and they had children around their knees, enjoying family happiness.</p>
<h3>Good News... Yuan Meiyun is Married</h3>
<p>The spring is bright, the spring breeze is swaying, the spring grass is sprouting, and the earth is full of spring. On this auspicious day: our young actress, Miss Yuan Meiyun, and the rough, tough guy, Mr. Wang Yin, held a grand old-fashioned wedding ceremony at 1:00 PM on the 21st at the second studio of Yihua Film Company. A pair of talented men and beautiful women finally became a loving couple. The magnificent hall, under the meticulous arrangement of the set designer, Mr. Fang Peilin, appeared particularly luxurious and splendid. The lights and candles were shining, the congratulatory banners were all over the walls, and there were many guests and even more spectators. The introducer, Mr. Shi Dongshan, ran around, directing with tireless effort, and also invited photographer Mr. Zhou Ke to come to the scene to film it as a souvenir. Until 8:00 PM in the evening, the wedding was completed with a solemn ceremony. It is heard that Mr. Shi Dongshan, in order to make Miss Yuan Meiyun's happy event public to the general fans, decided to insert it into his directed sound film "The Beginning of Man." This may also be a feast for the eyes of movie fans!</p>

<h3>Loving Mother of Students (Grand Girl) (3)</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Niperton was a black man, his shiny black face and his eyes with more white than black, no longer the timid and pitiful little student he used to be. At that time, because his homework was not up to par, he was dragged by Miss Merrill to the principal's office, where he tearfully told Miss Bales that because his family was poor, he had to work at night to earn some money to supplement his family, so he abandoned his homework. Miss Bales felt sorry for him after hearing his words. She didn't have much money in the bank, but she signed a check for twenty-five yuan for him. She kept seventeen yuan and fifty cents for herself, thinking that she would be paid soon, so it didn't matter. Besides, she would have a pension in two years, which was her guarantee for old age, so she didn't worry about money.</p>
<p>She said to the three of them very kindly, "What can I do for you?" Ward stepped forward and said, "Miss Bales... we..." He paused, and then said quickly, "We're here to tell you that we're on your side, no matter what others say!" William Biden also said, "That's right, Miss Bales." Niperton also quickly said, "That's right, it must be so." The principal thanked them in his mouth, but he felt a pang of sadness in his heart, and grateful tears filled his eyes. She reached into her large bag for a handkerchief. She felt a handkerchief, and when she pulled it out, she didn't expect two dice to come out with it and fall on the table, making a seven. Those were Dade's dice, which she had grabbed from him when he and her students were gambling.</p>
<p>At this time, Niperton saw a seven and his eyes widened like copper bells, and he couldn't help but shout, "A natural!" Bales was surprised and said, "Niperton, what are you talking about?" Niperton pointed to the two dice and said, "A seven jumps out! I think there's something... I think..." As he said, he grabbed the two dice and threw them on the table, and couldn't help but exclaim, "Holy Jicoti! Another natural!" Bales asked, "What? Do you call seven a natural?" Niperton didn't answer her words, and carefully looked at the dice. After looking at it for a long time, he suddenly shouted, "Hey, this isn't just any dice! This is simply a calendar, with three hundred and sixty-five sevens on it. Look, left is seven, right is also seven. Miss Bales, where did you get it from? This is defective!"</p>
<p>Bales exclaimed in surprise, "Defective!" She glared angrily at Dade's direction outside the window, when suddenly she frowned and had an idea. She then said to her three students, "You two can go, leave Niperton here." She said to Niperton, "You stay here. I want to talk to you... talk about this shameful gambling that you know so well." As she spoke, she couldn't help but feel proud. After Ward and William nodded and left, Roulan Bales immediately turned around and said to Niperton, "Good Niperton Jones! Now you tell me everything you know about this terrible game!" She fiddled with the two dice while thinking.</p>
<p>It was another afternoon, and like a brave warrior going to the battlefield, Roulan Bales walked into Dade's place. In her large pocket was a check, her salary, totaling two hundred and fifty yuan. She had already learned all the methods and terms of throwing dice from Niperton. Roulan laughed to herself, "A good teacher can always get some knowledge from his students." At this time, it was almost dinnertime, and the place was still empty. Dade was surprised to see her come in and asked, "What are you doing here again?" Roulan Bales picked up a stool next to him, sat down, and smiled, "Nothing." She deliberately smelled Dade's dinner, praising its taste; Dade said he cooked it himself. As he spoke, Roulan deliberately corrected his grammatical errors from time to time. Dade then asked, "Hey, what are you here to do? Are you here to correct my grammar?" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Reasons for Increased Gasoline Consumption While Driving</h3>
<p>— Zhen Min</p>
<p>When buying a car, the first question that car owners are most concerned about is the gasoline consumption per mile. But how much gasoline is consumed per mile is really a difficult question to determine. Engineers from various countries have jointly studied this issue and conducted dozens of tests under various conditions, but have not been able to obtain definite results. However, the approximate factors of gasoline consumption are nothing more than the following: (A) the roughness of the road surface; (B) the type of fuel; (C) the number of passengers; (D) the softness of the tires; (E) the type of road surface; (F) the slope of the road surface.</p>
<p>The same car consumes 10% more gasoline per mile when driving on a rough road surface than when driving on a smooth road surface. Inferior fuel consumes more gasoline per mile than high-quality fuel, because the combustion heat (per unit) of this inferior gasoline is very weak. Although the price is cheap, the result is uneconomical. The test results show that driving with this inferior fuel increases the consumption per mile by 8%.</p>
<p>Vehicles with more passengers increase the weight of the entire vehicle, and the reaction from the ground also increases accordingly. In this way, a huge amount of horsepower is needed to push the car body. This huge horsepower cannot be achieved without a large amount of gasoline. According to the test results, for every ton of weight added to the car, the gasoline consumption per mile increases by 15%. This result is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Under-inflated tires are enough to increase the resistance of the ground, and also increase the braking horsepower. Gasoline consumption increases accordingly. The exact number of this increased consumption has not yet been determined, because the air pressure inside the tires is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Driving on asphalt roads consumes very little gasoline per mile, but driving on concrete roads increases gasoline consumption by 12%, because the resistance increases. The consumption of driving on cinder roads and gravel roads increases even more, probably by 17%.</p>
<p>The slope of the road surface has the greatest impact on gasoline consumption. When driving uphill (over a bridge or up a slope), the gasoline consumption increases accordingly because a large amount of engine power is needed to propel the car body. For every 2% of height, gasoline consumption increases by 4%. When driving downhill, if the throttle is turned off and the car body is allowed to coast down, then gasoline can be saved by 3.6%. Therefore, the average gasoline consumption for driving uphill and downhill is just offset.</p>
<p>The speed is also closely related to gasoline consumption, but at the same time, the road conditions must also be taken into account. Although the speed increases when driving on a smooth road surface, the resistance of the tires on the road surface is reduced accordingly, and the power needed to propel the car body is reduced accordingly. The gasoline consumption per mile is naturally reduced a lot. Conversely, on rough roads, the increase in speed greatly increases resistance, and the gasoline consumption per mile increases very quickly.</p>
<p>The faster the speed, the greater the air resistance. This air resistance is enough to excessively consume the engine's power and increase gasoline consumption per mile. Although the bodies of new cars are extremely streamlined, they are still unavoidable from air resistance, so this gasoline consumption cannot be avoided, and it increases with speed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned reasons, there is also a seemingly unimportant but actually important issue, which is the engine's resistance. The interior of the engine is mostly metal-to-metal contact and friction, and there is a great deal of resistance in this contact and friction. Therefore, when the engine is braking, part of the power (it can be said that a large part) is used to offset this resistance, and the remaining part of the power is used to propel the car body. Therefore, the greater the engine resistance, the greater the gasoline consumption per mile. Poorly designed cars often have this drawback. Better-designed cars have reduced gasoline consumption to a minimum due to improved lubrication, but there is no way to completely eliminate this resistance.</p>
<p>Now we can summarize that the reasons for the increase in gasoline per mile are (1) the roughness of the road surface; (2) the increase in air and engine resistance; (3) the increase in the slope of the road surface; (4) the weakness of the tires; (5) the saving of gasoline, etc.; (6) the increase in the weight of the car body.</p>
<h3>Hudson and Terraplane, All Equipped with Steel Roofs</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Some say that 1935 must be one of the most important years in automobile history, because steel roofs were implemented and adopted in that year. It has been fifteen years since steel roofs were recognized as a goal by general engineers. From the appearance, it seems very simple and not of great significance, but in fact, after the steel roof is completed, several complex problems are completely resolved. As far as car owners are concerned, the adoption of steel roofs really makes the all-steel body stronger and safer. Passengers can sit safely in the all-steel car body, and at the same time, they can use the latest four-season ventilation system to enjoy extreme comfort. This ventilation device is also the latest progress in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The Hudson Car Body Manufacturing Factory specializes in manufacturing various car bodies for Hudson and Terraplane car assembly. There are many engineering experts in the factory who have devoted themselves to studying the steel roof problem for many years. They all admit that the use of steel roofs not only makes the car body structure more solid, but also greatly contributes to the appearance and safety. However, the reason why it has not been implemented is because there are many obstacles. One of these obstacles is how to avoid the annoying sound that naturally occurs on the flat and wide diaphragm surface of the roof. Another problem is that the natural expansion and contraction of metals has a great impact on the car body structure, and it must be eliminated. Fortunately, these problems have now been solved, and all 1935 Hudson and Terraplane sedans can be equipped with steel roofs. The method of making the steel roof absolutely quiet is particularly ingenious. Some of the principles imitate the management of sound waves by radio engineers. A material is applied to the roof, so the annoying sound that naturally occurs on the roof is eliminated by mutual resistance. Furthermore, due to the adoption of this structure, the appearance of the car body is extremely magnificent and the solidness is taken to an extreme. The new car body and chassis have now become a true all-steel combination as a whole, completely unaffected by climate or expansion and contraction. The solidness of its construction has been universally recognized by the automotive engineering industry.</p>
<h3>The Economic Performance of British Small Cars</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Hillman Minx Travels Over a Thousand Miles for Just Over Two Pounds</p>
<p>A reporter for the automobile column of the "Argus" newspaper in Melbourne, Australia, recently drove a 10-horsepower Hillman Minx sedan from Melbourne to Sydney to test the comfort and economy of light cars. The total distance was 1,150 miles, and the total cost of gasoline and other fuels was only two pounds and three shillings, averaging 23 miles per hour. The car carried three passengers and their luggage. This achievement is not easy.</p>
<p>The fuel consumption averaged 42 miles per gallon. The gasoline used was "Shell Imperial" brand, and the price per gallon ranged from one shilling and five pence to one shilling and eleven pence. It maintained its normal state throughout the entire journey, so in this 1,150-mile journey, each passenger only spent fourteen shillings and four pence.</p>
<p>The departure date was Thursday at 7:30 PM. The gasoline tank had six gallons of gasoline left, worth eight shillings and six pence. After starting the journey, there was a strong headwind. The car traveled along the Hume Highway and finally arrived at Albury shortly after midnight. The gasoline left in the tank was still more than half a gallon. Five gallons of gasoline were purchased in Albury, worth seven shillings and six pence. No other oil or water was needed. At this time, the journey was 200 miles, and the speed per hour reached 35 miles, but the engine was still relatively warm. To maintain the temperature of the radiator, a part of the engine cover was covered with kraft paper for the rest of the journey. After dinner, the journey continued. After crossing the border, the good stone pavement of Victoria was not lost. Then, the car traveled for several miles on a road under construction, which was rugged and uneven, and full of mud, which was very difficult to travel on. At dawn, the car passed Gundagai and had breakfast at Gekkin. By the time the car reached Yass, there was still fuel left in the tank. Two gallons of gasoline were purchased there, at a price of one shilling and eleven pence per gallon. Later, another gallon was purchased in Goulburn, worth one shilling and ten pence. One gallon was purchased in Picton, worth one shilling and ten pence. Lunch was at a hotel in Berrima, which has been open for a hundred years. Prime Minister Lyons sometimes stays there. The car arrived at its destination, Sydney, on Friday afternoon. There was still one gallon of gasoline left in the fuel tank. The cost of this journey from the departure point to Sydney averaged 33.8 miles per hour and cost one pound, three shillings and three pence.</p>
<p>Before starting the return journey on Saturday night, one pint of gasoline was purchased, worth one shilling. The gasoline shops purchased gasoline along the way were Goulburn, Albury, and Benalla. The car continued to travel that night and arrived in Melbourne on Sunday afternoon. There was wind along the way, and the average speed was reduced, at 30.26 miles per hour. Therefore, gasoline consumption was also less. The total fuel consumption was only twelve and a half gallons, worth eighteen shillings and nine pence, averaging 46 miles per gallon. During this test, the light car performed very well. During the operation of British light cars, there are often unexpectedly pleasant tremors, but this Hillman Minx was able to completely eliminate them. The comfort of driving was particularly satisfactory. When the car was driving, the occupants often slept for a long time and were not awakened by the movement of the car. This small four-cylinder, ten-horsepower engine was able to climb over several steep mountain paths without hindrance. When shifting gears, there was no need to move the clutch because of the freewheel device. It was also very smooth and pleasant when going downhill. The brakes and steering wheel were very good and easy to use. The Ross steering gear was particularly comfortable and pleasant. Therefore, after this test, it is more than enough to prove that British light cars are economical and suitable.</p>
<h3>New Humber Model Car</h3>
<p>Never Before Seen Such a Low Price</p>
<p>Humber Model cars have always been known for their stability, speed and luxury. The new cars of this year have made even more progress than before, and their low price is unprecedented. This car is indeed powered by aircraft, in other words, it has less resistance and higher speed, and the consumption of oil and engine oil is also less.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>It is light and fast when driving, making people feel like birds flying in the air. Its "stability, speed and comfort" must be personally driven to be known. The entire car body is new and beautiful, with extremely abundant light. It is equipped with a slanting windshield, a wide rear window and double wing windows, so that passengers can see the scenery in all directions. The seats are spacious and comfortable for three people in the front and rear. The doors are high and large, making it easy to get in and out. This car has now been shipped to Shanghai and is displayed at the Kangtai Motor Company at 627 Avenue Foch for all walks of life to visit.</p>
<h3>Recent Progress of Highways in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yuqing</p>
<p>In the past decade, only 1,400 kilometers were built; in the last twenty years, 3,100 kilometers were created.</p>
<p>In recent years, Zhejiang Province's construction achievements have been remarkable. Among them, highways are the most prominent. This fact is sufficient to prove it. Since the establishment of the Provincial Highway Bureau in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, highway construction began. However, due to financial constraints, the project was often suspended. Up to the twenty-first year, the total length of main and branch lines completed in ten years was only 1,400 kilometers. Since the twenty-second year, after Zeng Yangfu came to head the Construction Department, he recognized the rampant banditry, local unrest, decline of industry and commerce, and the plight of the rural areas. He urgently needed to build highways extensively to facilitate transportation in various places. He then drafted a highway outline plan and implemented it earnestly to remedy the situation. The plan was divided into nine major trunk lines and forty-six branch lines, totaling fifty-five lines with a total length of more than 4,800 kilometers. At the same time, he requested the National Economic Council to allocate road construction funds to supervise and expedite the construction of highways in seven provinces. The main and branch lines within Zhejiang Province were immediately surveyed and constructed day and night, proceeding actively. Over a period of two years, they were completed successively. The first phase completed included the Jinli and other eighteen roads, with a total length of more than 750 kilometers. The second phase completed included the Guan Zhou and other twenty-three roads, with a total length of more than 980 kilometers. As of the end of the twenty-third year, the total length of highways completed in the province was 3,100 kilometers. The various route sections are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jinli Road: This road runs from Jinyun to Lishui. The mountain opening project was very large. Construction began in December of the twenty-first year and was completed and opened to traffic in April of the twenty-third year.</p>
<p>(2) Changkai Road: This road includes Changtong (Changshan to Tongcun), Tonghao (Tongcun to Haoling Pass), and Xiafeng (Xiakou to Fengling) sections, as well as the Baisha Pass branch line and Baoan Street branch line. Only the Changtong section was completed in the twenty-first year. It was not until the end of the twenty-second year that all sections were completed and connected to traffic.</p>
<p>(3) Changkai Section: From Huabu via Xingkou to Kaihua, construction began in April of the twenty-second year and was completed in November.</p>
<p>(4) Qiuping Road: This road runs from Caoping to Qiuchuan on the Changyu Road and is one of the border defense roads. It has already been completed.</p>
<p>(5) Scenic Area Branch Lines: The scenic areas of this province are connected to nearby highways by branch lines. The completed ones include the Fanyun branch line, the Lishui Sanyan Temple branch line, and the Nanmingshan branch line, to facilitate tourist visits.</p>
<p>(6) Yinjiang Bridge Branch Line: This branch line branches off from Hengzhang Bridge on the Yinfeng Road to Yinjiang Bridge, with a length of eight kilometers. It has been contracted for lease by the Yinfeng Motor Company and has been completed and opened to traffic.</p>
<p>(7) Yichang Road: The earthwork for the section of this road from Yiwu to Dongyang was constructed by local conscripted labor. The Jiangdong Gang Bridge is a large project and was contracted out by the Provincial Highway Bureau. It was completed in November of the twenty-second year and opened to traffic first. The route from Dongyang to Changle in Sheng County is longer and the project is more difficult, so it was not fully completed and connected to traffic until May of the twenty-third year.</p>
<p>(8) Caosheng Road: This road runs from Haoba to Shushutan in Sheng County. With the permission of the people's request, a branch line from Lin'ao to Zhangjiabu was added, and the connection lines of the Shenghang, Shengchang, Shengxin, and Shengsan Roads in Sheng County were also constructed to facilitate connection. Construction began in October of the twenty-first year and was completed at the end of February of the twenty-third year. It was also leased to the Haoxin Motor Company for operation.</p>
<p>(9) Fuxin Road: This road runs from Fuyang to Shangjiangkou in Xindeng, connecting to the Hangfu Road. Construction began in March of the twenty-second year and was completed at the end of May of the twenty-third year. The Provincial Highway Bureau is responsible for opening it to traffic.</p>
<p>(10) Tongjian Road: This road runs from Shangjiangkou in Tonglu to Yangcunshu in Jiande, separated by the Fen Shui River and connected to the Fuxin Road. Construction began in April of the twenty-second year and was completed in June of the twenty-third year. Currently, a ferry dock is temporarily set up at Yijiang. The Provincial Highway Bureau is preparing to open it to traffic.</p>
<p>(11) Jianshou Road: This road runs from Jiande County seat via Yangcun Bridge, Baisha Wharf to Shouchang. Construction began in March of the twenty-second year and was completed in May of the twenty-third year.</p>
<p>(12) Xiangxi Road: This road runs from Xiangshan to Xize Wharf and is a section of the national defense road in the Ningbo area. Construction began at the end of September of the twenty-second year. The roadbed and bridges have been completed, but only the dirt road is passable. The formal road surface will be paved after funds are raised.</p>
<p>(13) Jinlan Road: This road runs from Jinhua to Lanxi and was built to connect the Shouchu Road and the Jinwuyong Road. All projects, except for bridges and road surfaces, are handled by the county governments. Construction began in March of the twenty-third year and was completed in early September.</p>
<p>(14) Tianmu Mountain Road: This road runs from Zaoxi near Yuqian County to the foot of Tianmu Mountain and is a branch line of the Hanghui Road. Construction began on March 10 of this year. The earthwork is handled by the county government through conscripted labor. It was fully completed in October. The Provincial Highway Bureau opened it to traffic in November.</p>
<p>(15) Longpu Road: This road runs from Longquan in Zhejiang Province to Pucheng in Fujian Province and is an important border defense road. It is 51 kilometers within Zhejiang Province and 39 kilometers within Fujian Province, all of which are constructed by Zhejiang Province. It was declared completed at the end of October.</p>
<p>(16) Ningheng Road: This road runs from Ningbo to Hengshan, remotely connecting to Xiangxi Road across Xiangshan Port. The project is handled by the Yin County government and has been fully completed.</p>
<p>(17) Zhenluo Road: This road runs from Zhenhai to Luotuo Bridge. The section from Zhenhai to Wangjia utilizes the Zhen branch line Yilu. The funds were raised by Zhenhai County, and the project was handled by the Highway Bureau on its behalf and completed at the end of July.</p>
<p>(18) Xintian Road: This road runs from Sanxi Town in Xinchang via Bamao in Xinchang to Tiantai. All projects are contracted out by the Provincial Highway Bureau. Construction began in April of the twenty-second year and was completed in July of the twenty-third year. It is currently preparing to open to traffic.</p>
<p>(19) Tianlin Road: This road runs from Tiantai to Linhai. Construction began in November of the twenty-second year and was completed at the end of June of the twenty-third year. However, a small part of the project needs to be cleaned up before it can be opened to traffic.</p>
