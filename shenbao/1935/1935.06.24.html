<p>— 年</p>
<p>一週以前記者以事返鄉時當浙束禾苗初植需水灌育而天氣晴熱雨澤稀少不類霉雨季節應有之氣象旣目見鄉農登水車而懼旱荒更回憶去年此時十一省大旱災開始之情形不禁爲之惻然及事畢回滬遇連日霪雨則又聞都市住民因苦雨情緒而歡水災之難免矣</p>
<p>今年夏季之氣象果將如一般人所杞憂造成水旱災以妨害農事乎？抑此後能倖獲適度之雨量氣溫以補益歲收乎？此則關係氣壓及其他天空現象之變動預言旣不可恃憂喜亦屬徒然記者今日所能就事實作解釋以資關心農事諸君之參考者（一）長江下游各地每年六月初夏之候原應爲雨澤最多之時其標準雨量達一百八十五公釐去年六月據上海徐家匯觀象台報告僅得四十二公釐只及標準雨量百分之二十三故成嚴重之旱象今年據昨日本報所載十六日至二十二日已得雨將及四英吋約合百公厘之譜更加以二十三日之雨水就數字言已不患寡倘二十三日起之雨量不超過八十五公釐似亦不至嫌多如雨澤更加則人爲之排洩工作不能不有所準備矣（二）據咋日本報所載連日大雨係低氣壓由江西向東移來所致此與霉雨季節之正常現象適相符合查長江下游之霉雨爲由北氷洋經日本附近洋面而來之高氣壓與由南而來之熱氣流互相衝激發生風暴遂以造成其移動之常態爲向東或東北去年因高氣壓行向之改變江南遂成無霉雨之變態今年據連日東風送雨之事觀之氣象似近正常此頗可爲吾農民解憂者也</p>
<p>記者於氣象學非有所深知惟在鄉時常受「今年是否更有旱災」之詢問回滬後又頗聞「今年恐將轉患水災」之談說爰據本報年鑑關於氣象之著錄就事實以爲解釋雖然水旱之患固關天氣調節水旱則人事也　如去年夏季雨澤澀於南而豐於北華北所得雨量並未甚越度而因海河系統之河道失修淤淺有年一遇多雨遂成水災往事如新國人鑒之又美國去年夏季與我同患旱災災區之廣災況之重僅稍差於我美總統羅斯福除撥救災經費外更頒布命令獎勵種樹防旱此又我國當局所宜效法者也</p>

<p>（巴黎）英國不管部閣員艾登談話終結、業於今晚十時啟程前往羅馬、關於談話結果、一般人以爲賴伐爾總理曾堅决聲明、二月三日倫敦宣言書所載各項建議（卽天空洛迦諾公約·多瑙河公約·東歐公約·　德國軍備解除限制各項問題）互相關聯、雖可分別舉行談判、但在談判未有相當進展之前、對於其中各項之一、卽未便作切實之决定、法國此種交涉方式、聞已爲艾登所接受、英國對於天空公約、自不致單獨與德國締結公約、至意國與阿比西尼亞之爭端、則艾登與賴伐爾並未加以討論、據聞艾登抵羅馬後、苟能與意相墨索里尼商得何項和平解决方案、法國無不樂於贊成云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英意談話主題</p>
<p>（羅馬）今日意外交部發言人聲稱、現希望艾登此次遊意之結果、能對英法意三國在斯特里薩會議中所展露之國結、重予確認云、艾登將於星期一日與意相墨索里尼在此舉行談話、如有必要、星期二日將繼續進行、所討論者固以海軍現局爲主要問題、但西歐天空公約與多瑙河會議二事、亦將順便及之、政界雖稱、雙方將不討論阿比西尼亞問題、惟恐不致一字不提也、英國之與德國締成海軍恊定、當然引起意國之驚異、惟就現象觀之、意政府對於英國實事求是之行動、亦能加以體諒、現信意政府對於海軍問題之意見、約略如下、（一）海軍限制、迄今以凡爾賽和約爲根據、故意國今或有擴張海軍之必要、尤其爲當法國從事擴張之時、（二）意國願派海軍專家參加最近將來之初步會議、以爲舉行海軍全體會議之籌備、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>意國所採立塲</p>
<p>（羅馬）英國不管部大臣艾登、約於本日午後七時可行抵此間、明日當與意相墨素里尼開始談話、據半官人士所稱、阿此西尼亞問題、雖足使英意談判發展前途、受其影響、且英意關係、是否將有變更、當視英國對於意國在東菲從事戰爭一事所取態度而定、然在此次英意談話中、則將不涉及意阿爭端、至於意國在此次英法談話中所採取之立塲、據半官方面宣稱、大概如下、</p>
<p>意國以為最近簽訂之英德海軍協定與凡爾賽條約及國聯會之原則、實相抵觸、且與斯德萊柴會議所成立之英法意聯合陣綫相反、至於英國政府主張意國應首先絕對履行國聯會對於阿比西尼亞事件所決定之原則、繼則將意國全部軍隊、留駐歐洲、以便履行斯德萊柴會議所規之義務、此種主張、意國方面認為理由薄弱、且法國對於英國主張態度頗為堅決、因此使意國地位亦因而增強云、（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）英國不管部閣員艾登與法總理賴伐爾昨今兩日談話之結果、使英法關係上之翳障、完全袪除、今日下午談話告畢後、賴伐爾發表文吿、謂渠曾與英閣員交換關於英德海軍恊定之各種有益的解釋、繼曰、「吾人更討論目前國際大局所引起之歐洲問題、吾人依二月三日倫敦之公報研究吾兩國政府應取之合作方式、覺吾人宜覓取實際的計畫以解決在倫敦所討論之各問題、此項問題不僅有益於吾兩國、兼及其他歐洲各國、艾登已以吾方建議通吿其本國政府、俟其由羅馬返時、余將再與會談、艾登與余意見相同、皆承認法英國兩國必須仍然忠於以集體安全組織密切經營歐洲和平之共同責任與工作、」</p>
<p>聞艾登關於海軍問題曾使賴伐爾了解英德海軍協定實聽令法國完全自由隨意增加其海軍實力、而法總理亦未微露有此意志、雙方對於阿比西尼亞問題、皆無一言涉及之、英法政界今日對於艾登此行所獲之結果、似甚歡悅、艾登於夜間啟程赴羅馬之前、曾接倫敦覆電、使其得向賴伐爾保證英政府切願儘速辦理二月三日倫敦宣言書中所舉各問題、今第二步驟爲商定最佳方法、而使各事得向前推進艾登已向倫敦提出關於此節之建議、尚需英內閣之核准、內閣將及時作决、俾艾登星期四日由羅馬返時、得答覆賴伐爾、艾登之建議並未由英外交部加以批駁、此可爲必由內閣贊許之佳兆也、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日據此間可靠消息、英國國聯事務大臣艾登、與法國總理賴伐爾之談話、未能成立諒解、因法國對於英德恊定、猶深痛恨云、惟羅氏已準備於艾氏赴意、與墨索里尼會商之後、再行晤談、而艾氏則表示此次談話、非常滿意云、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於英德海軍約定、法國政府前於十七日照會英國政府、提出若干異議、英國政府頃於本日備文答復、略謂二月三日倫敦宣言書所載各項建議、英國仍然贊成、英德海軍恊定實與此項宣言書之基本要點相融合、緣德國重整海軍之舉、出於該國片面行動、并非英德協定所產生之結果、而英德協定反以限制德國海軍軍備爲目標也、英國現行政策對於海軍問題、向主分別談利、益以海軍限制問題、并非承自二月三日之倫敦宣言、實乃華盛頓海約之延長、英國雖願與法意兩國合作、并締結天空羅卡諾公約、東歐公約、藉以鞏固集體安全制度、但亦不願海軍軍縮因他項談判停頓、而爲之遷延不决、此所以單獨與德國舉行談判成立協定之故也、英國政府茲希望法國政府能派遣海軍代表前來倫敦、俾就海軍問題籌備未來之一般會議、英國復文最後提及蘇聯海軍、謂蘇聯造艦程序祇須不違反常態而進行、則德國再度擴充海軍一層、卽無可躭憂矣云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）德國海軍特使里賓特洛浦、頃就英德海軍恊定向本社訪員發表談話云、「海軍談話獲有良好結果、因而成立協定、端由希特勒元首暨英國政府要人眼光遠大所致、至可慶幸、溯自若干年以來國際談話、所在有之、各國閣員僕僕於他國首都、鮮能有所成就、此次英德海軍協定、實乃第一次之成功、亦卽軍備限制問題第一步之進展、諺日貪多嚼不爛、歐洲事卽中此弊、舉其要者約有二端、（一）各項問題須當次第解决、各國乃欲一舉而解决之、（二）切問題集關係國全體於一堂、而欲同時加以解决、此何異於緣木求魚、」里賓特洛浦又謂、德國以為樹六和平、須以實現事態爲基礎、各項有關生存利益之問題、當由雙方協定予以解决、至於多方談話、迄未有所成就、自非德國所能贊成、英德兩國海軍問題此次確定解决之後、影饗所及、兩國局勢已爲之澄淸、卽其他一切問題亦因而有解解之望、「抑英德海軍恊定成立後、歐洲時局因以奠定、德國相信歐洲在文明世界中、當担任重大使命、英法德三圈及其他歐洲各國務須互相團結、藉以維護歐洲文化、要之、歐洲與大不列顛帝國均當自強不息、此固德國所深信不疑者也、」里賓特洛浦繼提及某報批評德國不當離間英法兩國、謂「作此說者頭腦陳舊、不堪言狀、實非德國人士所能了解、或謂余一生致力於英法德三國合作、俾使其他國家從容參加、誠屬不誣、英法德三國合作、實乃目今最佳之事、此層余深信之」云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）高橋藏相在第二次內閣審議會所提之日蘇互不侵犯條約訂立問題、及國防與財政之均衡問題、均成爲當前之要案、故今後之進展頗被重視、陸軍當局擬於下屆該會在二十八日開會時、將對於上項各節表示見解、是以今後該項重要問題之發展、至堪注目、茲聞其大致情形如左、</p>
<p>（一）世人以爲偵訂立日蘇互不侵犯條約、則卽可縮少軍備、但此種想像實係大誤、蓋國防乃持有永久性質者也、如被條約所惑而減低國防、則此種議論不得不謂爲具有危險性質矣、關於訂立日蘇互不侵犯條約、曾由外交當局迭次說明、首先將以解决兩國間之懸案爲先决條件、（一）財政與軍備之均衡問題、亦爲陸軍方面所希望、决不甘落人後、但當討論此項問題之際、倘其態度以不增加發行公債及不增稅爲前提、則未便贊成、現今世界形勢極其嚴重、非僅將來更有漸次緊迫之勢、且日本之國情上、其非常時局尚未解消、值此軍備更須強化之秋、不能不認爲係不可能之事實、故陸軍方面處此不能避免強化軍備之國際情勢下、如欲維持財政之均衡、則亦非從來所謂健全財政之意、更將以積極之意義而應付此項問題、爲謀財政之積極進展起見、則增加發行公債實有必要、亦係出於不已、至此項方面之研究與審議亦須認爲必要也云云、（廿三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日內閣審議會就現在之財政狀態、國防費頗多不當、勢將要求軍部大臣說明將來之見解、陸軍方面以爲說明國防預算、涉及軍方機密之處較多、在國務大臣會議之外、不能濫於詳細說明、若加說明、而國防預算之計算計畫係由統帥權决定、旦其性質隨國際情形之變化而變化、故依國際關係變化之現狀、應慎於國防費將來之預測、抑亦不可能、因此林陸相將於適當之機會、請求審議會諒解、（廿三日電通電）</p>

<p>省政府</p>
<p>省政府設於舊督軍公署、（即保定行營）房舍尙可敷用、省府遷來之先、經一度粉刷、故外觀尙稱整齊、省屬各科、設於內院、外院爲禮堂·交際股·電務股·收發處·傳達室、主席及秘書處、則設於內院正廳、工作方面、除電務股及秘書處迄未中斷外、其餘各科、業均開始、新任兼代主席張厚琬視事後、內部職員、曾小加更動、計加派劉潛蔣錫曾二人爲省府秘書、原任監印主任佟述曾、調任科員、遺缺委趙各奎接充、原任會計主任韓傳緯、調任科員、遺缺委袁熙緩接充、全體省委兼各廳廳長、於于學忠交卸主席職務後、特由張厚琬領銜分電蔣委員長·汪院長·黃委員長·何委員長、表示辭職、當由汪院長及黃委員長復電慰留、汪復電云、「時局艱危、端賴毅志撐持、共期匡濟、兄等茂績久孚、尙望勉爲其艱、照常推行庶政、以資綏輯、至深盼勗」、黃復電云、「際此艱危之會、得兄等合力主持、藉以安定人心、維持危局、良用欣作、尙祈勁抑議衷、力爲支撐、渡此難關、是所切禱」、現各廳長旣經汪黃挽留、業均打消辭意、惟省委兼秘書長魏鑑、决定辭職、雖尙未蒙批准、但魏於省府交代乎續辦竣後、即離保去津休息、尙無返保之期、</p>
<p>民政廳</p>
<p>民政廳設於有府之東院、該處房合、爲昔日之陸軍監獄、故一切多不合格局、業經從新修葺、所有各科佔用房屋、亦另加改造、及加以佈置、以致一切工作、延至近二日方告開始、據民政廳長張厚琬談稱、本廳由津夾保後、內部怖置、極費時日、刻大致妥定、不過所存檔案、仍感無處存放、本人原擬省府遷保後、扔出發各縣視察、以便調查民間情形、但今旣兼負省府職務、故原定計劃、遂作罷論、民政廳方面、今後决定人手辦理澈底禁毒、剿滅殘匪、各縣自治、設立倉儲、四種要政、同時本年各縣、多吿荒旱、亟須有以救濟、不過旱區過大、而省應又過緊、以致救旱經費、尙無着落、此爲本人近所最躊躇之一事、至於本廳內部工作、業已完全照常進行云云、</p>
<p>財政廳</p>
<p>財政廳工作、本極繁瑣、而工作人員亦較他廳爲多、故原定該廳設於光園內部、因光園房舍　暢、較爲適用、惟光國原爲十七軍司令部所佔用、該軍離保、初無確期、該司令部所佔房舍、僅勝讓後院一部、財政廳即暫以後院爲廳址　廳長魯穆庭、以地方不敷辦公之用、迭向省府交涉、迄無結果、而該廳工作、又不能一日間斷、遂在院中架設天棚、所有各科次要工作、均在天棚下辦理、近聞十七電司令部移設鄭州、各科將可全部移入室內辦公矣、該廳近通令各縣、急速設立金庫、以資各縣金融得有周轉、統計股方面、正在趕製二十三年度經常收支總報告中、廳長魯穆庭、近由保去平、辦理要公、又河北省銀行、决定仍設天津、俾金融周轉便利、保定省會、暫設分行、</p>
<p>建設廳</p>
<p>建設廳設於省府西院及後院一部、該廳係最先遷保、故所有卷宗器具、運到亦早、十日前、該廳內部、即完全佈置停當、並已開始工作、據該廳秘書長于馥岑談稱、省府遷保後、平保及津保兩汽車路、為交通要道、本廳遷移之初、即通令沿路各縣負責修墊、並限期完成、現已經修墊竣事、行車頗感便利、各河春工完成後、本廳已派員出發驗收、至於全省電話網、近已在積極籌辦中、將來擬先就津保話綫、加以改善、又省府遷保後、保定旣成省會之區、關於市容及省會之建築上、似應加以修飾、刻本廳擬先派員調查、然後人手興工、即以城墻一項、急應修補、以資壯觀、不過此項工程、需費甚多、省庫是否有此餘力、尙未敢預卜也、</p>
<p>敎育廳</p>
<p>教育廳原以辦理全省會考、决定暫緩遷保、故當時僅秘書處·及第一科·並第二科之一部、由津遷來、其業三第四兩科、仍留津辦理會考事宜、現全省會考已經奉令停辦、而教廳留津部分、亦决定提前移保、刻已在積極準備中、但敎廳房舍、亦極狹小、現行宮舊址、已由五十一軍部讓出、敎廳一部、擬即設於該處、該廳秘書長張雨蒼、昨由津來保主持一切、廳長鄭道儒、今日（十七日）亦返保、據該廳秘書梁子美談稱、本廳留津各科、定於日內全部遷保、並擬將行宮房舍借用、目前除辦理停止會考及結束其他事務外、並在趕製二十四年度敎育經費預算、預算內容、决定對於職業敎育及社會敎育經費稍予增加、其他完全仍舊、保定各私立學校、均頗進步、敎廳擬均予以獎勵、俾促其益臻善境、外傳敎廳取締各辦理不善之私立小學、並收回其佔用房舍說不確、</p>
<p>公安局</p>
<p>保定公安局、原爲特種公安局、近省府遷保、自應同時改爲省會公安局、現已經省府例會通過、决定將保定特種公安局、改爲省會公安局、局長仍由原任苗作新繼任、該局奉令後、刻正在準備擴大組織辦法、且以今後省會治安、極關重要、現有警額、不敷支配、必須增充　額、不過省庫支細、是否能將公安局預算、予以增加、尙無所聞、據該局局長苗作新談、保定公安局改組問題、已經省府會議通過、且保定旣已成爲省會之地、地方治安、自較往昔重要、刻本人正在力謀改良警政、不過經濟有限、以致進行倍感困難、本局改組事、即人手辦理、將來警額、必須增加、警餉亦擬稍加提高、現城防係由第二師負責、該師已奉令南開、故該師離保後、城防治安、亦將由本局保安隊接防、本人刻正在設法增加經費、未來改善事宜、　須視經費增加多寡爲轉移云、（六月十七日）</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>胡君健同胡美珍，是兄妹倆。</p>
<p>胡君健是某大學裏去年出來的畢業生，學問也還不錯，但是自從去年暑假畢業之後，一直到現在，就沒曾找到一個位置。他也曾東求親，西託友，更陸陸續續的發出了不知若干封的自薦信，結果，都沒一個滿意的答復，他也曾去應過若干處和若干次的公開考試，結果，也一無成就。</p>
<p>他在大學裏念書的時候，也曾有過女朋友。可是畢業之後，昔日的女朋友，都和他漸漸地疏遠了。到了現在，女朋友們，不只是和他疏遠，就是在路上碰了面，竟很少有肯和他點一點頭。甚至有老遠望見了他，便紆道的避開他的。他受了這個雙重的刺激，所以平日總是書空咄咄。</p>
<p>但是他的妹妹胡美珍，卻就處於和他絕對相反的地位。伊是在高中　畢業的，在未畢業之前，便有兩家公司慕着伊高材生之名，派人來和伊接洽，聘為女職員。一位同學的親戚，在一家銀行裏當協理的，很誠懇地請伊去當女秘書。而同時呢，情書像雪片般飛來，雖然是不相同的，也都肯把心都摟出來。</p>

<p>當小孩子被他母親責打了，在大哭後會來一個癡然的沉默，患肺勞病的人他也會常常自己沉默着，一個平日享受優美的物質環境的人忽然從高山上跌下來，度着困苦的生活，他也會時時沉默着。……</p>
<p>沉默，現在讓我來說一個沉默的人吧——</p>
<p>杭州劉陶案中的主角陶思瑾小姐，以前伊不是一個受着藝術洗禮的少女嗎？然而現在入獄了後怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>那一天我隨着許多人的團體去參觀第一監獄，在那邊的女監裏，陶思瑾小姐沉默地出現在我們眼前了。</p>
<p>「啊，這裏是陶思瑾！……」一個低的聲音從一個團員的嘴裏響着，霎時變了兩個，三個……</p>
<p>於是我也擁擠在人堆裏仲長了自己的脖子去看這位久已聞名了的陶小姐。</p>
<p>陶小姐穿着一件藍色士林布那麼的有邊的棉旗袍，下面穿了條綠汪汪顏色的褲子，長而微小的褲腳直連至那雙棉鞋北有。人坐在一倏短條凳上，沉默地頭低着，低着，（或許伊的心在極急的跳動）低得使我們看不見伊的臉來，我們衹看見了伊的頭發；衹看見了伊的手裏執着一本書沉默地瞧着，衹看見伊的同伴—當然，也是女犯人——們沉默地室內踏着步，又時而安閒地瞅着我們，只有陶小姐老是低着頭，低着頭，像很用心的瞧着那本書。伊像不願意我們瞧着了伊的臉，伊像史不願意和我們談天；雖然我們在這裏停留了一個時間，然而我們終於沒有瞧到伊的臉！伊像耳朶裏失了聽覺的，伊也正像泥塑木刻那麼的，伊動都不會動，我疑心伊周身的毛竅都沉默了！</p>
<p>「沉默啊！——」</p>
<p>一種窒息的空氣使我的心也沉默了－我和另一位團員特別離得後，全體的團員已轉彎了，我們還在慢慢的走着。</p>
<p>當我們走到轉彎的地方，我們像發現了他們已走出，女獄門已關住的，我們又重新的折回，我們又向陶小姐室內瞧了一瞧：陶小姐仍那麼沉默着，伊仍木刻似坐着像很用心地瞧着手邊的書，瞧著，瞧著－－</p>
<p>「沉默啊！——」我帶着這樣的心情和那位團員從淮來時的女獄門走出了。</p>
<p>我現在回想起來，彷佛那位陶小姐還出現在我眼前！</p>
<p>沉默啊，——</p>

<p>志前見他的樣子，很是　窘，這就把顏色慢慢和平下來。因道：你看了什麼不服氣，這樣怒氣填胸。北海於是將在前面所聽到的話，都向志前說了。志前不由得笑起來，因道：你是陜西人，對於這樣的事，你是司空見慣的，為什麼生氣？在這小西天作瓦匠的一個老頭子，他的姪兒子是個莊稼人，很大的力氣。而且還認得字。可是那老工人對我說，他的姪子，願意跟我去當奴才，不要什麼工錢，有飯吃就行了。一個男子都願意去當奴才，那麼一個女孩子，願意去當姨太太，有什麼奇怪？若說到以前鬧旱災的時候，這事就更不用提了。北海那一股子火氣，跟着慢慢平息下去，無精帶彩的在他對面的椅子上坐下，垂着勃子偏了頭道：不過這件事由我眼裏看來，總覺是不對勁。一個很好的姑娘，這樣去糟蹋了，大是可惜。像我們這樣有熱血的人，不應該見事不救。志前山他進屋子來那番冒失的態度看起，覺得他實在是合於少不更事那四個字的批評。便笑道：我們又怎能救他？除非我們出錢把他買過來。然而我和我太太感情很好，說到這裏微微一笑，接着道－我當然是不能再討姨太太的。至於你，你那裏有那麼些個錢，作金屋藏嬌之舉。他說着，可就抬了兩抬肩膀，表示着這是一椿笑話。北海一時出於情急，隨便呌着要救人，其實怎樣的救法，他並不曾打算（二四七）</p>

<p>不料，第二天的早上，就使我們每一個人不由自主的驚　太后的先　了。因為這一天的清早起，天上就下着很大的雨，兼有很猛烈的風，雨勢便分外的大了。粗密的雨點，和積瀦而下的簷水，不斷地在我們這些宮殿上的黃瓦上必剝必剝地打着，泊泊地流着，發出很煩雜的聲音來。同時雷聲又在萬壽山的頂上忽刺刺地震着，電光在陰霾中閃閃地耀着。－於是闔宮的人，都有些害怕了。我自己的臥室是在昆明湖的一角上，和太後所居的寢宮離得很遠；這一天湊巧我又並不輪到隨侍太後，我瞧雨旣下得這樣大，便打算不上伊那裏去了。不料早有人急急地趕來召我，我那時就覺得某種可怕的事件也許會在短短的幾十分鐘以內發生了。但瞧目前的景象！昨天這一座整個的頤和園，不是像一座異花滿地的海島仙山嗎？到處喜氣揚溢，歡暢無比；而今天却一變而為充滿着一團死灰色了。（三四七）</p>

<h3 id="c146">蘇州的園林 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 朱戳</p>
<p>天氣是逐漸的炎熱了，在這時間，好遊玩山水的人們，除了避暑名山的要人富翁外，普通的人，因為天時的炎熱，而不能遊玩，於是園林，就代替了山水，做遊人消遣的地方了。蘇州的園林，原是很有名的，因為時代的遞變,有的是荒廢了,有的是停止開放了,小小地起了今昔不同的一番滄桑.現在將蘇州的園林近況，寫在下面，做來遊蘇州的人們的南針。</p>
<p>公園　蘇州的公園，自從築池建山，興建了民　亭後，已略具邱堅了．在這夏季，是蘇地遊人納涼的好地方，尤其在月兒升上柳梢的薄暮黃昏，那草地的遊憩椅上，和歲家飲食鋪和茶寮，和幾家臨時飲食商店外，電影院和華羽商店憶拆為平地，而新建了一所測候所。在公園中央，那所「蘇州圖書館，」雖保住着荘嚴的外表，然而因經濟的拮据，內部是缺乏新的擴展。至於公園的風景芳草芊芊，繁花如錦，是有着一種空　的景象的。</p>
<p>留園　園門五福路上留園，是蘇州著名的園林。佔地的廣大，建築的富麗，在蘇州園林中，是佔據首席的。園中有四面廳，楠木廳，涵界山房等廳堂，那幾塊「冠雲峯」等太湖叵石，更是有名的奇石。留園係盛氏家產，曾由公家保管了數年，自從前年發還盛氏後，經過了一番大大的修茸，現在已恢復以前富麗的舊觀了。</p>
<p>西園　西園在留園東邊，是戎　寺的放生池。那池面積很大，一泓清水，別有一種碧波漣漪的清趣，魚池中央，健着一隻六角亭，兩邊通着九曲石橋，亭影人水，風景怪可愛的。園中除放生池外，也有些假山點綴，那隻大廳也是供遊人品茗休息。</p>
<p>獅子林　獅子林在潘偶巷中，是由氏的私園，但遊人前往，一紙名片就可入園展覽。園內的假山，曲折宛轉，極盡邱壑變幻的能事，據說是古代名畫師雲林所乎十三堆，獅子林因係富商的家園，廳堂花木，　修茸得金碧輝煌，饒有富貴氣。</p>
<p>怡園　怡園是富紳顧氏的家園，在所護龍街尚書里內。有牡丹廳，藕杳齋，南雪亭等等，園中對聯上的詞句，係清代顧文彬所自撰，多集古人詞句，雋妙典雅，在蘇地園林中，是獨擅勝場的。</p>
<p>拙政園與蕙陰花園　拙政園在西北街，係清時的奉直會館，門前的一架紫籐，是明代文衡山先生乎植的古物。園中有荷花廳，早船等建築。南顯子巷的蕙蔭花園，園內的水假山，建築得怪別緻的，田西園都　年久失修，已遂漸荒廢，蕪草不除，廳堂坍頹，使人遊玩時，引起一種名園邱墟的感慨。</p>

<h3 id="c169">四川幣制之動態 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 趙尊白</p>
<p>四川幣制之複雜紊亂，在全中國各省中，恐怕沒有這樣的現象吧！考騐這種現象產生的主因，無疑地是防區惡制所演成。因謂在任何防區中之軍民財政，都爲當地駐軍長官所支配，絕對不受中央和省府之管轄與拘束。所以四川軍事長官的權力，實無異野蠻部落的酋長。時時因權利衝突，發生火併，在這火併的環境中，他們要想地位鞏固，必然的是以武力爲後盾。但武力的强弱，純視經濟盈虛爲轉移，中於餉械的消耗，須籍巨數金錢去補充，有了這樣情勢，他們不能不力求自身經濟之充實：一面施展苛征重斂的手段，攫取民間的現金；面收買優良貨幣，改鑄不合法定的省幣，這都有鐵一般的事實證明。此種動機，全基於充實本身經濟的慾念。那末在四分五裂的四川，各軍軍部差不名都設有造幣機關，而一般戰鬥力强的師旅長，也可以自由鑄。他們迭幣的目的，只求賺錢，偷工减料的弊病，不能避免，而製成的貨幣，成色絕對不足。在他武力所及的地方，司以壓迫行使，若是防區之外，那就感鞭長莫及了。同樣，甲戌區的貨幣，不能行使於乙戌區；乙戌區的，不能在甲戌區內自由流通。造幣機關這樣多，又是自由鼓鑄，產出的貨幣自然複雜。况且各軍爲鞏固經濟勢力，絕不容許他軍的貨幣侵入，因恐怕佔據他的市塲，破壞經濟組織，暗中無形施以排斥。社會中的奸商，乘着這種機會，故意造成種種風潮，對於某種貨幣，認為成份不足，拒絕牧付，有些須打折扣才能行使。於是雖同一貨幣，他的價値，各地迴不相同，幣制紊亂複雜，民衆生計感着軍大的威脅，農村經濟輕輕地走上破產之途。去年冬間重慶申匯達到一千八百餘元的新紀錄，全川貿易幾乎停頓，這因軍人濫發紙幣，現金缺乏，貨幣本身的價値陡然低落，形成全川金融大混亂，愈顯示四川社會經濟已迫近總崩潰的時期。</p>
<p>現在四川已漸向統一之途前進，從前分崩離析的政局，逐次趨於合併，地獄般黑暗的四川，彷彿有一棧光明的憧憬。但摧殘民生經濟最力的紊亂幣制，還不曾聽着有改善的動議。我們知道，幣制紊亂的地方，他的財政絕對於不會有淸明的可能，幣制由分岐而趨於統一，是社會蛻變之必經歷程。所以要想四川成爲政治修明的區域，幣制改進，實不可緩。然而有效的改進，必賴嚴密的計畫，嚴密計劃之產生，當以翔實的事實作根據，否則違反現實，施行時候决無美滿的成績。所以特將個人去歲調查訪詢所得的資料，以簡明的叙述，供我國改革幣制專家的參考，促起國人研究的興趣，共同建立四川統一的幣制，是個人創寫此文的最大企圖。</p>
<p>最先設銀幣吧。</p>
<p>四川在淸代貨幣本位完全以兩作單位，市面流通有五十兩十兩五兩的銀錠。光緒廿七年後成都造幣廠成立才鑄銀幣，背有龍紋，十四元合銀十兩，社會呌做「火」。民國創建，四川軍政府廢棄龍紋鋼模，改鑄漢字大洋」正面有一軍政府造四川銀幣一的字樣，背有篆文「漢」字，字外有十八小圓圈圍繞，民國六七年重慶銅元局，也鼓鑄銀幣，形式和成都造幣廠的相同，僅僅背面「漢」字外的綫紋，有一綫穿到外圍的小圈裏。因爲這一點的差別，川西北各縣民衆，叫牠作「重慶版一以別於成都廠造的銀幣。後來防區制成立，成都商人對於重慶造的貨幣，加以歧視，直到劉湘入成都後，這種情形少少消滅，但在川西北農村裏，仍然是拒絕行使。「漢字半元」民國八年成都廠才開始鑄製，那時四川軍隊數量增加，餉糈困難，因幣制條例，半元含銀成分較大洋少，容易賺錢。造幣廠在道時停鑄大洋，專造半元，製造越多，獲利愈多，所以當事者僅求產量增加，大量趕造。但造幣廠機械舊敝，成品異常草率，而所用的鋼模，最初是「元字開口角字出頭」的一種，後來造幣廠時時易人，製幣鋼模，也常常變更式樣，於是產生尖花，圓花，五瓣，六瓣，的區別。造幣廠本屬國營，在四川分贓式的防區制裏，係隷屬於廿八軍鄧錫医，有了這樣的分配，其他各軍有製造銀幣賺錢狠易，各軍修械所相繼製造，而一般有勢力的師旅長，都拿出私財購買造幣機械。恰恰成都高工校畢業的李姓技師，設了一機械廠，專做翻沙車鑽的工作，師旅長紛紛向他定造造幣簡單機械，千餘元可買一部，他們有了機械，便在防區內自由鼓鑄，但是原動力缺乏，用人力替代，那末製成的硬幣，產生厚薄不勻，花紋糢糊的現象。况又爲致富慾的驅迫，夢想一下就大大賺一筆錢，幣中銀的成份可說迫近於零，有的完全是銅，這種五角硬幣民衆呌做「雜板」因牠不是造幣廠造的。流通市面的數量，約有三千多萬元，這種銀幣，含銅太多，一剎那間行莊拒絕收付，商人隨着金融界的舟趨，當時成都幾乎重返以物易物的社會。「雜板」價値　然低落，而一般民衆對於這巨萬的劣幣，最初是以一元作大洋一元收進，最末付出，一元僅値大洋二三角，商店受着這種影響，常時倒閉，軍人看着雜板價値太低，沒錢可賺，才停止製造，雖是這樣，在他們確早致富了，只苦了一般無拳無勇的民衆！過後三軍部成立聯合辦事處，係二十八軍二十九軍二十四軍所組織，民衆痛憤已極，餽贈他們一付賀聯，說：「四川銀元破爛啞，三個死人鄧田劉」這是四川貨幣狀况的素描；由此也可見民衆展轉武力卜之可憐，惟一的只有咀咒了。近來各軍仍然私造大洋，四川財政特派員陳紹嬀曾請中央明令禁止，在民衆很盼望快快成爲事實，此將四川銀幣神類調查錄於左：</p>
<p>大洋</p>
<p>（一）淸代龍紋大洋淸代大洋各省造的可通用，如吉林湖北江南。但有數縣不用北洋雪南造的，或作九折行使。如幣背面龍形較市面流通的少小，大足縣呌作「半龍大洋」，市塲完全拒用。</p>
<p>（二）四川漢字大洋成都造幣廠造的，各縣通用。在雲陽奉節作九八折行使。若四川銀幣的銀字，他金旁的第三構畫，雖作一筆，但不成水平，從起筆到收筆，其閒微成灣曲，這種硬幣，俗呼爲「峭扁擔」係私鑄，各縣拒用。</p>
<p>（三）袁頭大洋面有袁氏像，民國三年造的，通行全川。其八·九·十·三年造的，民衆謂袁氏已死金銀成份不足，川西北及川南近滇各縣拒用，現因硬幣缺乏，已可流通；但有些地方，仍須折扣行使。如羅江三年造的，一元可易銅幣十六千。九十年造的，一元僅換銅幣一—三千。又有一種袁氏睜眼的，俗呼爲「睜眼大洋」川西北各縣不用，川東一元作八角行使。</p>
<p>（四）中山大洋面鑄中山先生像，有「開國紀念幣」五字者，和二十二年中央造幣廠造的通用。惟武勝縣鄉鎭少有拒絕收付的情形。古宋縣須打折扣，如袁頭一元易銀角十二角，中山幣一元只能換十角。</p>
<p>（五）金字大洋係民國八年重慶銅元局造。因成都造幣廠所造的大洋，銀字的金旁作金，重慶造的作金，民衆叫做「金字大元」太半拒用，重慶附近縣邑，作八折行使。</p>
<p>（六）重慶靑杠壩大洋係私鑄，字跡較粗，市價低，多不用。</p>
<p>（七）重慶大洋爲重慶銅元造，和成都廠造的形式相同，僅背面漢字四周的直棧有一綫穿入小圈裏，民衆呌做「重慶大洋」。近可流通川西北。惟羅江對於這神硬幣，交易不用，只能換銅元。八年造的有造字者，大足不用。又新鑄的的，大足叫做「　鬚大洋」不用。</p>
<p>（八）合川大洋幣面一圓的圓字，字形較扁，背面綫紋僅漢字國內有的，這種叫做「合川大洋」係私鑄，各縣不用。</p>
<p>（九）雲南大洋係雲南民初造的，字跡細的呌做「鋼板」不流通。字跡粗的在琪縣作九角，他縣拒絕行使。</p>
<p>（十）赤水大洋係前黔主席周西成氏在赤水造的。一圓的圓字出頭，俗叫做「周大板」銀幣含銀很低，川東各縣作五六折，永川作八折，川西北各縣拒用。</p>
<p>（十一）搬椿藏洋係英人在印度製造，爲藏人使用的。上有英漢藏一元的字樣，面有英國國徽及人像，含銀成份較他種高，川西北民衆很重視，多深藏家裏，不願流通市面。</p>
<p>至於破爛啞各種銀幣，流通市塲，收受均須補水，如川西灌縣光啞或鏧破者，每枚須貼水四五百至一千，無市價，其補水多少，由收受兩方議定。</p>
<p>半元（五角幣）</p>
<p>（一）雲南半元背有龍紋，周有四珠，一珠恰當龍尾，名「甭邇珠」通用。價至高，約當大洋九角。沒有迴珠的不用。又龍紋龍足爪較長的，叫做「長脚龍」，各縣不能流通。射洪以此幣作銀本位。</p>
<p>（二）川龍半元川造幣廠造，通用。惟壁山除來鳳丁家馬嘶正心這些鄉鎮，可通用，其他鄉鎭不用，價値較漢半元少高。</p>
<p>（三）川漢半元成都造幣廠造，通用，市塲作六折行使。</p>
<p>（四）唐頭半元有唐繼堯像，雲南造，市塲呌做「旗版」。川南，西，北通用，華陽作八折，餘作七折不等。</p>
<p>（五）袁頭半元通用，有袁世凱像，市塲作七五折。</p>
<p>（六）雲南新半元民衆呌做「鋼版」近滇各縣可用，他縣拒絕行使。（未完）</p>

<p>— 段仲榕</p>
<p>四川田賦之重要性</p>
<p>自一八四二年，門戶開放之後，列強向我國各地，大施其侵略政策，四川地大民勤，物力殷阜，尤爲帝國主義者所覬覦。英國在四川已有相當之經濟勢力，並亟謀發展，去秋轟動一時之德善公司借欵案，即其明證。且有所謂「大西藏計劃，」如壯種侵略計劃成功，將實現他的「大西藏帝國」，此時四川恐怕也是他的殖民地了。美之煤油，亦竭力向四川推銷，四川的美孚煤油行，與英之亞細亞公司，壟斷全川煤油市塲，其售賣所，達於鄉鎭，川民所用之煤油，鮮有不爲英·美·者。俄之標布，德之顏料，日之航業海產，亦皆以四川爲侵略之對象，因此四川的經濟，已到了總崩潰的時期。</p>
<p>加以川局，經過去長時間之割據，互相火併，烽烟連年，十室九空，民衆生機垂盡，貪汚土劣，復從而投井下石，於是朱毛徐賀等，有「羅明路棧」之採取，先後逃往四川，經中央軍入川痛擊！始大挫匪勢，迭復要地。但目前欲改革四川，發展工商業，抵抗列强之侵略，肅淸川中殘匪，消滅中國前途危機，皆不能不賴財政之穩定充實。自中央與地方劃分稅源後，各省財政收人，以田賦爲主，而在四川，工商破產之時，除舊佈新，尤爲有賴於田賦之推動。</p>
<p>四川田賦之危機</p>
<p>川省財政，素稱混亂，橫徵暴歛，不顧民命，巴蜀父老，苦於苛政久矣，而尤以田賦之壓榨爲最甚，不特增加迅速，預徵過度，附加雜派，亦甚繁重，於是危機生焉，茲將四川田賦狀况，列表於後，以資說明。</p>

<p>就第一表觀之，歷年國家預算，所列四川田賦之總收入，共爲六百餘萬元。四川有一百四十餘縣，平均每縣負擔之田賦，爲四萬六十餘元。自民國十五年以后，田賦徵收額擴大，各縣擔負，大為加重，以民國十七年至十八年而論，二十一軍的防區，僅十六縣，而其田賦收入，爲二百餘萬元，平均每縣負担十餘萬元。以民十九至廿一年而論，二十一軍的防區，爲二十八縣，而其田賦收入，達九百餘萬元，平均每縣負担三十餘萬元，民十五以后，田賦徵收，有增無减。就第二表觀之，川省田賦有一年數徵，或十餘徵者，四川人民有的納完了民國五六十年的糧，有的納完了民國八九十年的糧。人民担負之納稅額，普通佔其產額十分之六以上，以眉山而言，該縣每糧一兩，正附稅，須繳納洋八十六元二角六仙，每糧一兩，平均可收穀四十五石，（每石二百五十斤）現在市價，每石約値洋三元，以四十五石計，可售洋一百三十五元，除去糧稅洋，僅餘四十八元七角四仙。（四川月報二十八號）甚有每糧一兩，全年須繳百餘元者，較昔日稅額，超過十餘倍，以產額全部繳納，猶有不足，此外尙有雜派。四川潼南雙江鎭紳民楊子豐，家有田產數千畝，爲縣中第一巨富，共有糧額四十餘兩。年來因收成不佳，糧欵過重，入不敷出，負債纍纍，將田地到處出售以完欠糧，乃出賣多日，無人承買，致被人讓爲「端起金碗行乞」。又江安靑龍鄉，農民萬義和，有田地不過數畝，年收租穀十二石，載糧八錢六分，每年總計共應繳大洋一百餘元。義和因田中收穫不足，而催科之吏，復登門索討，無力耕種，遂呈請徵收局，請將田土歸還國家。徵收局批云：「查糧稅爲國家正洪，納稅爲人民義務。本局職司政權，奉令涓滴歸公，實無减免權責。據稱穫少出多，比比皆然，該民請將田土責還國家，從無此種辦法，着無庸議，此批」。（二十三年，十二月，二十一日，北平晨報）其在川東南道上之永，榮，瀘，富，隆，等縣，農村破產，各地小紳，債台高築，無法償還，紛紛被債權人押控於政府，而政府則惟有將其田產，拍賣攤還，往往欠債數千元，或萬元者，其產業即掃蕩盡凈，尚不足以攤還二三成，况當此時局維艱，產業無人承買，政府只得一再减低價格，布吿召買，然一再張貼，終無承買者。此類布舌在永，榮，瀘，隆，富，一帶，日有所睹，例如田租二十石，拍賣價，僅一千元者，亦鮮人接受，其原因，不外現金枯窘，與賦稅過重所致。（民國二十三年，十二月，二十三日，渝商務日報）徐庭搖氏云：「川省民間疾苦不堪言狀，錢糧已徵至民國七十餘年，有一年間徵十二年糧者，人民不堪負担，多將田單契據貼於門上說明本人無力償欠，請官廳將其田契沒收，不再捕捉索償」（徐庭瑤由川返京談話，見四月十二日新聞報）由此可知川民受田賦之壓榨過甚，納稅能力，已到竭　之境。政府徵收田賦等於取締稅之性質，人民的田地，無異被政府沒收。是以人民有賣田納糧，請將田地歸公之舉。而田地出售，因田賦擔負過重，已無人承買。</p>
<p>西哲云：「徵於息者謂之租稅，徵於本者一謂之搶刦，」搶刦之徵，民何以堪，漢時之黃巾賊，明末流寇之亂，美玉之獨立，莫不有苛徵之原因，四川田賦奇苛，因之土匪蠢起，而共匪乘之爲亂。去年全國財政會議田賦案之决議，附加以不得超過正稅爲原則，其在原科則輕微之區，則以正附稅併計不超過地價白分之一爲限，現有田賦附加，無論已否超過正稅，自二十三年度起，不得以任何名目再有增加，其已超過正稅者，應限期遞减。而四川由賦之附加，不特超過正稅，且至二十倍以上，（見第四表）此外尙有按糧攤派之雜欵未計。川省府改革後，雖决定各縣田賦一年一微，然正稅之外，又附徵臨時軍費三倍，徵解費一成，此不特與財政會議增附加及遞减之法令相背，其於培養稅源，寬恤民生，亦相乖謬也。</p>
<p>四川田賦整理方策</p>
<p>由前所述，今日之四川田賦，危機如此，整理工作，不特刻不容緩，且須有妥善之方法，實際能减輕人民負担，乃能促進川政之革新。茲將整理方策分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）整理耕地甲·各縣田畝，丈量確實總數，按照各縣原有條糧總額平均分攤。乙·丈量法，按田畝計算，荒地，山林，陰陽宅不計。丙·旱地菜園地，河壩地，以三畝折算一畝，丁·將各縣田畝分爲甲，乙，丙，丁，四級，一石以上爲甲級，八斗以上爲乙級，六斗以上爲丙級，四斗以上爲丁級。如此則賦均等，可免有田無糧，有糧無田之弊。</p>
<p>（二）釐訂微收手續往者四川因防區制關係，各行其是，任憑吏役弊混，多無一定規章，以致徵糧乎續，紊亂不堪，五花八門，莫可究詰，政府稽核艱難，偷漏常多，是以應釐訂徵收現則，一洗從前泄沓之惡習。甲·自二十四年度起，一律實行以銀合糧，一次徵收，預先折算科造，并呈省府財廳備案。乙·各縣應於二十四年度開徵前，將全縣各糧戶戶名，畝數，及應徵糧額，編造徵册，務須依照規定詳晰塡註，不得敷衍漏塡，幷根據徵冊，編造聯單，其形式由財廳製發，各縣不得自由備製。丙·聯單共分四項：一·存根，二·執照，三·通知單，四·報吿單，（送財廳備查。）此種辦法，即四聯收欵單是也。塡發聯單，須一律用正楷，幷加盡紛字木戳，不准用其他簡便字號，單面所載糧額，應包括應納之一切糧稅。丁·自二十四年度起開徵手續，應於開徵前辦竣，不能於開徵後一紙空文，呈報了事，今後微收田賦，應呈財廳核准，或奉財廳命令後方司開徵。戊·各縣於每年度田賦開微前，務須將通知單，先期發給各業戶查覽，幷將田畝等級，稅率，稅額，及其他業戶應注意事項，另行出示週知，印製簡要說明書，分發各區鄉行政人員廣爲宣傳，以便業戶按期投完，藉杜「抬糧一之損失，及個科吏，叫囂勒索之惡習，己·各縣應於每年度開微前，將每畝應微稅率，及全縣正附稅額，及共百分比，詳細列表呈報財廳備核。庚·各縣田賦徵收籌籍，表册，至少須具備後列各項：一·每日收發聯單登記簿，二·現金日收簿，繳欵簿，及微獲稅欵日報單，此單應備二分，一呈財廳，一登政府報紙公吿。</p>
<p>（三）遞减賦額年來農村衰敗，大都由於賦稅繁重，有以致之。四川田賦之重，本已出人意想之外，復加以雜派之担負，民力益困，如此欲圖農村復興，建設四川，無異叫三歲之小孩，舉百斤之鼎，烏可得耶。查去年廢除苛雜，及田賦附加，計稅目三千餘種，稅欺一千八百餘萬元，（去年十二月十五日申報）而課稅最重，附加項日最多之四川田賦，竟無一種稅目廢除，一元稅欵减免。今四川新省府雖於三月一日命令廢除苛雜，停止田賦預徵，而一徵之外，另徵附加稅二倍，徵解費一成，此種異名不異實之辦法，其於人民毫無補益，是以川民，仍有被田賦壓榨之哀號。（見三月十日天津大公報陳紹嬀與四川財廳函）百姓不足，君孰與足一，今四川農民，旣無負担能力，若不予减輕，田土歸公者，將益增加，即不增加，亦必欠賦日多，此時財政上之影響，必較今昔吏甚。故减輕田賦，爲勢不可緩之舉。然地方財政，窮窘已久，而事業又不可偏廢，寗能驟减互欵，所以折衷之途，採遞减之法。甲·團委會費一角三仙，應自二十四年度起，每年减免一半，至二十五年度减淸。（理由）旣有團欵，無須再有團委會費（見五表）乙·建設公吿費四元，自二十四年度起每年各减一元，至二十七年减淸。（理由）田賦附加中，建設公吿費很重，欲减輕田賦，不能不减此費，且田賦附加中，已有建設經費，此費實爲繁苛。丙·契稅五元二角，自二十四年起，每年各减三分之一，至二十六年减淸。（理由）田賦附加以此費爲最重，查契稅導源於買賣田土，納糧並非買賣田土，何能納契稅，且買賣田土，於糧稅徵收外，尙須另納契稅，顯係甫稅不公，故應遞减。丁·經莊一元三角，自二十四年起至二十五年止，平均廢除。（理由）經莊之用途，於政治民生無甚關係。戊·房捐五角，自二十四年起，平均兩年廢除。（理由）各大都市旣有房捐之徵收，田賦中復附加房捐，實有未當。（以上各稅目均見五表）其餘斟酌稅目之性質，以定遞减時期之長短，務期减至與去年財政會議規定之標準符合時，姓行停綏。</p>
<p>至整埠田賦，减輕田賦後之抵補問題，在四川則只有緊縮之一途。蓋四川財政，早已羅掘俱窮，一時旣難開源，而中央可以撥補地方之烟酒牌照稅及印花稅之一部，在四川，復早未解交中央，中央雖將此稅全部撥歸四川，四川財政上之收入，亦毫無增加。</p>

<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>—幾種生物的描寫</p>
<p>徐拙菴所寫的書，决不止於這薄薄的六卷。藏書不在手邊，一時是無從查起。就書的內容看，這大約是他在國亡以後寫作的一總集。但已經是「很有可觀」了。從書里可以見到，他不僅如我們日常所曉得的，是擅長詼諧，也是一位高妙的「寫生手」。</p>
<p>書名所以叫做「懸榻編」，是因爲他的室名叫做「懸榻居」。他「山閣幽居，郊無片瓦，入閱即棲蘭者，」何來「縣榻」呢？這是他的同學苗蕃爲他特地在鰲峰上修葺的。書前有苗藩，方□，文德翼，李淸八十三歲時的序。隨筆，雜記，小文，佔全書之大半。</p>
<p>周作人曾稱藝術爲「避難的世界」，明亡以後，又不肯仕，徐拙菴當然也變成「藝術的難民」之一，山居不出，寫作詩文，以排苦遺悶。爲避免文字禍，祇得捨「康莊」而就「小道」，這是無可奈何，千古同悲的事。這小道，也各人所走的不同，有的去做和尙，有的去修前代的遺民錄，有的混跡於「市井小人」之間，有的各處奔波拚命的看花，而徐拙菴却獨自另走一條路，去研究生物，想到小生物羣中去找人類。</p>
<p>他寫的關於生物的文字特多，而且有如莊周伊索，把它們作為寓言的張本。不過，把他所附的每一則的寓意也聯繫起來，却很少能算上品，大部分是很迂腐的。祇有單純的去看他如何的描寫生物，才能以發現他是値得我們注意的。不妨先看看他寫的是那一些生物：</p>
<p>龍，信天翁，雞，犬，鶿，蟻，蠅，雁奴，馬，蛇，鸛，蠏，騾，虎，魚，鯪，蜂，猴，雀，象，墓，牛，蛙，蟢，犬，蟲，鼠，兎，鹿。</p>
<p>大槪總有四十種。他很歡喜它們，覺得比人類好，不惜用川很大的力量去描寫。他作文，很歡喜用奇特的題目，如「五鑑，」「五喟，」一五噱」，「五憫」，「五怪」，如「一錢生傳」，「半面人記」，「三是虎記」，「怪病記」。共性格之怪癖，在命題上就表示得很明白。</p>
<p>道裏想說到的，祇是部分的寫生物的小文。寫「信天翁」說：「鷺之性狎水，以水虫爲食，每乳則啄而哺之。或不勝啄而中墮者，纍纍然。童子黠者，恒以盛夏入巢鷺之山取魚蟮，必得也。有烏曰信天翁者，性懶拙，不能銳喙自食，又不肯與鷺爭食若童子。則常仰棲樹間，俟鷺之啄而過而或墮者，接唼之。鷺未必時過，而不經其樹，而未必墮，墮而唼焉，或不中者，若是，信天翁皆不得食也。然而信大翁卒不死」。又如寫「鶿」云：</p>
<p>「鶿水鳥之類，鳧而健喙者也，善捕魚，河上人多畜之。載以小桴，至水渟淮，魚所聚處，輒趨之人。鶿見魚，深沒疾捕，小者啣之以出，大者力不勝，則碎其翅，呼類共搏，必　之乃已。而漁人先以小環東甚項間，其大者旣不可食，得之皆攫去，小者雖已咽至環處，鯁不可下，漁人又輒提而捋之，魚纍纍自喉間出。至枵極，乃稍以一二飼之，而又驅之。如是歲歲，鶿常與魚爲仇，有貪暴名，終不得飽，而漁人坐享其利甚厚。」再如寫「雁奴」云：</p>
<p>「雁之性善睡，宿于野，恐人謀已，則使孤者司警，有所見，高鳴憂憂，若傳呼然，羣雁輒隨之起，謂之雁奴。有黠者貯火竹管中，潛行至近處搖之，火星噴出爛然，旋韜而伏。雁見火至，謂有寇，矍然而呌。羣雁鼓翅交應，久之寂然無所覩，于是怪奴欺已，小啄之，復就宿。少頃伏者再起，舉火搖動，奴又輒叫，羣雁又輒應，已又寂然，則益怪，啄之加甚，如是數四火，卽數四驚，又數四啄。奴見火之無害，而啄不勝苦也，意稍快，不再復警，羣雁亦不復應，于是張網遍其宿處，譟而攻之，羣雁夢中起，盡在網中不可復脫。」</p>
<p>像這樣的描摹生物的性格動態，而且傾大部分力量爲之，可謂不易，這是在當中作家中很少見的寫生文字。很遺憾，拙菴竟深恐讀者不了解他的用意每條下面都要加上兩倍字數的說明，使文章的價値反而被損害了。其實就不再加一個字，意義已是够明白了。</p>
<p>從這一傾向看，拙菴頗似當時的一個寓言家，而且有着高深的文字技術素養。我覺得這些文字，比之當時流行着的一類山中小品，在意義上，是有價値的多。如其寫那麽一身邊瑣事一，遠不如寫這些東西，還具有生物學的意義。</p>
<p>拙菴除寫動物的性格勒態外，也歡喜寫它們的特殊技能，經過人力訓練的技能。在「懸榻編」裏也　有一些。如「猴梨園」，「蟻隊長」，「蛙敎授」，「雀先生」，「犬舂」，「虫穽」「鼠竊」，「　捕」。前三者，是當時賣藝的，爲着生活訓練出的「生物的演技」。</p>
<p>「猴梨園」記猴戲，和現在我們所看到的差不多，不同的，祗是以口唱的曲子及其聲調爲指揮。如曲子轉爲女調，猴子就「于簏中取粉臉更戴之，作織步軟態」。「蟻隊長」，寫賣蟻者以兩竹管貯黃黑蟻，玩時放出，使其大鬥，戰後各自歸筒，秩序不紊。「蛙敎授」較特殊，似爲吾人所未見者：</p>
<p>「以筥盛蛙十數，至人家出之，中有一老大者，南面盤坐，餘蛙以次東西班列，相向甚肅。斯須老蛙發聲一叫，　蛙次第應之。已再連叫，則再連應。嘐嘐喀喀，聲饗大噪。良久老者收聲，衆蛙亦止。戲者以筥側而收之，老蛙蹩　徐入，餘踵繼焉，無一亂者，謂之「蛙讀書」，上坐者敎授先生，傍者門下士云。」</p>
<p>我覺得這個把戲，眞是太有諷刺性了。可惜這種戲，已經失了傳。徐拙菴按這一則，說師弟之道，「尙賴蛙館留之」，其感慨是可見的。「雀先生」就是現在的雀子算命。「犬春」却是是一種買賣，把它們訓練出來，專門替人春米等，以得錢過活。共法是：</p>
<p>「支木爲架，橫板爲杵，用軸活之。置架於地，犬輒豎前兩足，板搭架上之橫木，若手凭然。以後足印板，踏而運之，一高一下，杵聲憂憂，勻且適也。呼之止即止，欲春又復驅之，一日歷數十家無倦。」</p>
<p>「虫穽」爲一種食蟻的虫，其得蟻之法，是掘穽于路，使蟻滑人，就而食之。「鼠竊」則殊出人意外，寫鼠歡喜偷雞蛋，其偷法，是「以一壯碩者，翹足仰臥，羣鼠簇卵加其腹中，攬持已固，然後倒行，啣其尾曳之。踰歷垣穴，無弗可也。」這眞有些聞所未聞。「蟢捕」寫蒼蠅虎，如何捉蠅，却是我們所熟知的。</p>
<p>寫生物的技能，大都這樣的可愛。拙菴在國亡以後，如何的把精神寄托在這些小生物身上，也就可見了。雖然他不是要做一個生物學家，但對於生物的興趣，是很濃厚的。還有一則寫「金魚」的，寫的也非常的好：</p>
<p>「一池渟瑩，中畜金魚無數。結隊游泳，柳陰覆之，顏色倍好。時風從池上過，倒影搖曳，若千百釣絲，出沒波間者。魚亦掉尾避去，已定復來，宛轉可玩。」（迎園紀事）在他的「記」憂，這一種的文章很不少，是很「神韻」的，不過這已經不在我要說的範圍之內了。</p>
<p>「懸榻編」有很多的好文章，而生物的描寫，是史爲特色。他的文字，用舊話說，是屬於「淸新老鍊」一路的。要說他是「卓然大家」，自然是不够，但總是可讀的作品。把不同於其他許多遺民作家的，是別的集子裏，無論寄托在那一面，總遺可以正面的看到許多遺民的哀思，很熱烈的抒情文字。而「懸榻編」是沒有的，祗能從他的歷史上，看到這是他一種無可奈何的寄托。</p>
<p>「懸榻編」是一部禁書，不多見，禁的理由，大概是因爲裏面有壽錢謙益文，與錢謙益書，柳如是小傳，這篇傳寫得很好。以偶而的機會，用單價得來，已經有四個月了。以忙迫故，散頁故，未曾細讀，又因窮窘，幾乎兩次的易了主人。今日因已修整完好，取回展讀，我深以當時兩購主未會買去爲幸。歡喜之餘，在窗外不斷的呌讀聲中作此記，時一九三五年六月十八夜。</p>

<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>愛好圖畫，（雖則自己不會圖畫的），這也許是我入所同具的心理，因爲每個人都具有愛美的情感。我就是一個不會繪畫却愛好繪畫的人，因爲爰好繪畫，便認識了不少的畫伯。最近在華安大厦開過展覽會的王濟遠先生，也是我所深爲威佩的一位畫家。他是一個最忠於自己藝術的人，生性又好游歷，因此他每年都有巨大的收穫　今春，他先到香港非律賓去遊歷一番，便帶了不少的作品還來。在靄靄停雲，濛濛時雨中，他描寫出了柔美得像少女的香港，出嫁了九十多年的香港原來是這樣的可愛！他又描寫菲島的落日，溶化的鐵液般的畫面，刺戟，熱烈，熱帶的菲島的色彩，整個傾瀉在你眼前，殺那間，將你帶到那炎炎的去處；同時又是一個蒼茫的海，展開有你的脚下，一片艷麗的深藍，跳躍，活動，這正是菲島特個的蔚藍。兩幅風景，一冷一熱，恰成爲一個絕妙的對照！他從菲島回來，不久，我又送他上了東京的旅途。從東京又帶回內海附近島嶼的面影，組悍的綫條，擴厲的色彩，竟將我們可愛的芳隣的品性也一筆抓住了！最使我個人神往的，又是他的一個旅行的收穫，就是他旅行紹興所作的水墨畫羣。紹興，我曾遊玩幾年山水的紹興，問誰，想起「山陰道上」，能會否認那美麗的山水？王濟遠先生却巧妙地應用水墨來描繪了，「禹陵春雨」繪他攝了魂來，「東湖之春」又到了他的筆底「大禹陵」，「吼山」，「陸　翁讀書處」，紹興的勝景，相別了多年，謝謝王先生，大部份都來我眼前了。那美妙的取景，恰到好處；中西調和的色彩，鮮妍艷麗，一點也不露硬凑的痕跡，像放翁快開一幅，　描出了橋如虹，水加空，天教稱放翁的情趣。我看王君的展覽已過句日，印象却還極新鮮，不知曾去參觀過的也有這樣的感想否。像王先生那麽努力共所業，已屬可佩，而能常保藝術家的心地，不作畫家的政客，更屬可畫。何况他的收穫又是這般豐富美滿呢？</p>

<p>市長走開了，弗里茨就端了一杯酒到門前給他。「祝你平安，師傳］」他懇切地說；『現在我要同娜麗跳舞了，她跳得很好。』</p>
<p>但恰在此時，共他的男孩子乎裏拿着滿杯的酒，也一窩蜂地跑了來。他們和他碰杯，模仿他的灣腰行禮！他每次碰杯時都要灣腰行禮的，實在做得太過火了！並說着標種滑稽的客氣話。</p>
<p>娜麗站住沒有動，她的眼睛沒有離開她的父親；但我聽見她的小牙齒如何咬得沙沙作響。</p>
<p>音樂家再奏起樂來，其他的男孩子都跑回大堂裏去。我還同娜麗站在門邊。</p>
<p>「呵哈，菲力先生！」裁縫叫出來幷伸手給我，「都是些又漂亮又可愛的少爺們！但是說一句體已話！您和娜麗，您和娜麗…，菲麗先生！」這時小黑眼睛便非常溫柔地看着他的孩子底面孔：像受了一種不可抵抗的激動那樣，他把長臂伸進堂內來，把她拉到自已胸前。「我的孩子，我的寶貝！」他低聲說。小姑娘吻了他，帶着一種熱烈而悲苦的溫柔用雙手抱着他的頸項，用着她那漂緻小頭靠在他的肩上。但接着就離開他了，幷緊握他的手，低聲地懇切地對他說話。我不懂得她的話：但我看見她的眼睛帶着懇求神氣注視他的眼睛，又看見她的小手戰慄地撫摸他那憔悴的面頰，像安慰他的痛苦一樣。起初他微笑着疑惑地搖搖頭：但他剛才表白他的地位時那種喜悅的自信心漸漸從他眼中消失了。「我知道的，我知道的，」他喃喃地說，「你是愛你的可憐的老父親的，」但現在音樂開始奏出「對舞」底曲調了，他同女兒握了手，默默無言地，不向大堂內冉看一眼，便沿着長走廊走開了。</p>
<p>這時弗里茨走了來，邀請他的女舞伴。—她跳舞仍像往常那麼從容：不過往常那種一切不在乎的如夢如醉的神態已經沒有了，在這次的迴旋舞中却祇見她現出一種溫雅的嚴肅態度。在休息時間，她像石像那樣向前直視，一面用雙手把太陽穴旁的光亮黑髮抹向後面去。她的男舞伴底戲謔，她像未曾聽見一樣，從耳旁滑過去了。</p>
<p>跳完「對舞」之後，我們所學習的跳舞也就完了，但我們的跳舞興趣還未曾完。我們的秩序單上還有「華爾茲舞」「蘇格蘭舞」「卡洛巴舞」，甚至還有一個「哥提庸舞」，—我已準備好了飾紐和鮮花，打算在跳「哥提庸舞」時候送給娜麗。</p>

<p>— 鳳子</p>
<p>看上海的報紙，知道這幾天正在開映沈西苓導演的鄉愁，那劇情我，點不知道，但看牠的廣吿好像是描畫悲歡離合的，中間還揷了一點炮火和　鴻。廣吿上引著李后主的詞，設：「春花秋月何時了？往事知多少；小樓昨夜又東風，故國不堪同首月明中。玉砌雕欄應猶在，只是朱顏改，問君能有幾多愁，恰似一江在水向東流。」可見所謂「鄉愁」，大概是說征人旅客的勞思，至多也不過是被幽囚者的哀懷。</p>
<p>然而在他們的鄉下，現在也正開映著一張影片，那片名也是一鄉愁」，導演不知道是誰，劇情可實在悽厲得很，演員的賣力，尤其是任何影片里都我不出的。每一滴淚，每一滴血，都說明了他們內心眞誠的疼苦。</p>
<p>這影片塲面很大，但我所看見的，恰只是一角。</p>
<p>去年的黃梅時節，不曾落過一滴雨；幸而河里有水，早稻是僥倖挨過去了，然而付稅還租，剩在耕選自己頭上的，還是個精光大吉，大家心里滿望著晚稻能够好一點，留些糙櫔來餬口。然而一天兩天，十天白天，老是不下雨，到得應該收穫的時後，田里團一團的，令是亂蓬蓬的枯草，泥土龜裂的隙縫，隨處可以把農夫的脚陷下去，連專害禾苗的蚱蜢螟蝗也都餓光了，那里還找得出半粒米來。</p>
<p>流連喪亡，我不知道那些農去們是怎樣挨過冬犬的。但冬天終于過去了。剩下的活著的農夫，一到開春，大家又有了新的希望。背下了厚利錢，找到點苦本，下秧，戽水，一邊耕，一邊耘，把希望一株一株的揷到田里，等著牠開花，結子。培養道希望的肥料，是汗和血。</p>
<p>天又是不下雨，河水很快的乾了。</p>
<p>愁苦立刻爬上了每一個人的臉，每一顆心。老年人開始嘆起氣來，　着說是「天收」；婦人們的脾氣也特別暴躁了，每家的門前洋溢着打罵孩子的聲音；孩子們又似乎更愛哭些，　愛咬鬧些。村上的空氣，這幾天來，有了一個緊張的突變。農夫們大淸早起來，第一件事是望天空，然而天空是一點　　也沒有雨意，一朶白雲從西面的天邊飄過來，飄過來，緩緩地飄落了東邊的山頭，剩下的仍舊是一望無際的藍色的天空。</p>
<p>農夫們期待着的是黑雲，是大朶的，風雅之士看了做不出詩來的黑雲，然而沒有。</p>
<p>田里的禾苗，一天比一天黃，一天比天枯下去了。農夫們小心地跑到田邊，把葉，梗，根仔細視察一番，看有沒有一絲綠意。只要在綠色還沒有完全褪盡的時後，能够下一點雨，是的，只要能夠下一點足够浸潤的雨，那就還有復蘇的希望。</p>
<p>禾苗一天不死，農夫們的心也是一天不死的。</p>
<p>「十天，倘使在道十火里能够下雨……」然而九天，八天，十天，六天，多麽快的日子呵！</p>
<p>老年人的嘆氣，婦人們的打孩子，孩子們的哭閙，越來越起勁了。「宣統元年，晒煞苗田，今年會怎樣呢？」大家這麽想。</p>
<p>我不知道這張影片的結束是在什麽時后，我也不知道牠將有怎　的結果。我只記得牠的片名呌做「鄉愁」。</p>

<h3 id="c181">山海工學團衛生工作實況（上） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 雲怡</p>
<p>一·衛生室成立經過</p>
<p>山海工學團成立于一九三二年秋季，其主要目的，在依「生活卽敎育」的理論，試騐最經濟，最通行之教育方法，以求在目前窮困社會狀態之下，得敎育機會之擴展。健康敎育在生活敎育中爲一重大目標。成立伊始，卽得國立上海醫學院公共衛生科之協助，指導計劃，捐贈藥品，建立衛生工作之根基。一九三三年春上海女靑年協會，下鄉從事婦女敎育派專人担任衛生工作，工學團之衛生活動，與之合作進行。不意入秋以後，該會衛生工作人員他去，工學團爲事實所驅迫，乃推選女輔助員一人，前往上海市衛生局高橋衛生事務所，接受公共衛生初步訓練。直至一九三四年六月底，該輔助員回團，組織衛生室，確定最低限度經費，衛生工作，方能自主進行。光陰容易，現在恰及一週年，各項活動，雖無成績可言，然在此人財兩難之鄉村衛生活動下，各地同志，或可資以參考。</p>
<p>二·衛生信念之建立</p>
<p>鄉村衛生工作，所感受思想上之障碍與經費人才問題同樣嚴重。此種障碍，不惟農民之成見，迷信，不易破除，卽敎育工作者所蘊藏之傳統觀念與偏激見解，一時亦不易轉變。一年來，吾儕遇有機綠，對思想上之切磋，必不放過。所用方法歸納如左：</p>
<p>甲·公開討論工學團之輔助員，小先生及各種活動之參與者，對所執行之工作，每星期日必有一次集合討論，互相磨礪。衛生工作人員，遇見解上之差異，或工作上之困難，必利用此時機，提出激刺思想之具體問題，公開討論，求得歸結。</p>
<p>乙·定期講演兒童工學團，靑年工學團，婦女班（女靑年協會主辦）凡能按時集合，接受衛生講演者，衛生工作人員，取得同意，規定時間，前往講演，以喚起衛生，信念推動衛生工作。</p>
<p>丙·自由談話工學團原以「社會爲學校」，凡稻塲上，田埂旁，茶園里，療病室內，對農夫農婦，病者，必藉當前事實，與之自由接談，灌輸衛生常識，改正傳統觀念。</p>
<p>丁·文字宣傳衛生工作或問題，遇有持久性普遍性者寫成文字，投登工學團週刊，生活敎育半月刋，中華敎育界及工學團出版書冊中。</p>
<p>三·健康檢查與缺點矯洽</p>
<p>團員健康檢查爲實施衛生工作之起點。衛生室成立之後，編製名冊與檢查表格，分別赴各工學團檢查。但工作人員爲能力所限，不能按檢查標準，完全執行。且檢查結果，是否完全可靠，亦不敢自是。茲將檢查結果，抄錄如左：</p>
<p>砂眼病　七二·三</p>
<p>視力　一三·六</p>
<p>牙齒　一五·五</p>
<p>營養　五·六</p>
<p>皮膚病　四三·一</p>
<p>聽力　一一·一</p>
<p>扁桃腺　二·二</p>
<p>工學團散佈六大村莊，各項缺點，全賴衛生室工作人員矯治，勢有不能。補救辦法，于各工學團，選擇團員，組織救護隊，每日來衛生室學習矯治輕砂眼與皮膚病方法，純熟後在各工學團執行矯治工作，保管藥箱。衛生室工作人員，每日費半日工夫，前往各處，輪流輔助，解决困難。其缺點較重者；仍每日集中衛生室，個別矯治推視力，聽力，牙齒，至今爲能力所限，無法補救</p>
<h3 id="c182">尿的現象 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>——醫學故事之二——</p>
<p>從人體中微小的組織細胞產生出來的大部分廢物，跟血液和淋巴液作周身的循環。在循環的路上，這大部分廢物經過專任從血液中抽除廢物這重要工作的腎臟。腎臟從血液中把廢物濾出，和入稀薄的液體中，而輸送至專門承受與積聚這些廢物的膀胱。再從這器官，隨時受腦中樞有意識的指揮而排出體外。這排出體外的液體，我們稱之曰尿。</p>
<p>尿從腎臟間歇而不停地輸入膀胱，其速度大概爲每一腎臟每隔三十秒鐘輸尿一滴。這不是臆測，却是醫生親眼看到的，醫生用一種精巧的窺測器挿入膀胱，便能看到兩條輸尿管的口端，又用精細的空心橡皮管挿入這二口端，分別承受從每一腎臟輸出的尿滴。橡皮管拖出外面，與坡璃管相接，從此可以看到尿滴的情狀與速度。</p>
<p>尿液中含有尿酸鹽，使尿液呈微黃色的就是這尿酸鹽。若尿液中尿酸鹽的成分太多，膀胱便受刺戟，人便覺得不舒服，或竟害病。膀胱好比一個貯藏所，把尿液逐漸收容。當尿液的容量達到一定的程度，就是當膀胱不能收容更多的尿液的時候，或當太過濃密的尿酸溶液的刺戟造成不自然的飽滿意識的時候，尿道的隨意肌便弛放而讓尿液流出體外，飮水過少的人往往因尿液中尿酸鹽的成分過多而使膀胱常受刺戟，結果就是小便頻數而且短少。所以，小便的次數不一定與飮水的分量成正比。</p>
<p>藉騐尿以檢查身體的健康，由來已久。在許多故宮的圖畫陳列室中，我們可以看到舊時荷蘭名畫家所繪的醫生騐尿圖。白金罕宮中唐（Gerard　Don）氏的Liebeskranker　Madchen，布魯塞爾宮中鄧尼爾氏（Teniers）的Site　Arzte，是最動人的作品。當中一個害病的女人坐着，傍邊一位醫生手握盛尿的玻瓶對着陽光仔細察看，神氣怪莊嚴的。尿的顏色，閃光，和沈澱物，是那些聰明的醫生藉以診斷症狀的材料。據說，在美國醫學進步的初期，有將尿液倒在火上視火燄顏色的變化以定病狀的診斷法。火燄熄滅，表示病勢很凶；火燄發藍，表示死期迫近：火燄發綠，表示害的是膽汁病。一個名呌佛利斯（Thomas　Willis）的英國醫生，首先發見糖尿病者的尿帶有甜味。</p>
<p>一八二九年，英國醫生勃賴脫（Richard　Btight）發見患水腫的病人的尿液中含有飛似蛋白的凝結物。這是他在把病人的尿液盛在錫湯匙中放在燭火上煎煮的時候發見的。這方法目前仍然通行，不同的只是用玻璃試騐管代替錫湯匙而已。</p>
<p>尿中含有蛋白質，不一定就是患腎病的蹬據。有時健康的人尿中帶蛋白質，却毫無腎病的痕跡。患肺炎或扁桃腺炎的病人，尿中亦往往含蛋白質。所以，除却騐尿之外，周到的醫生必須檢查全身。</p>
<p>腎臟中或膀胱中的晶石的造成，正和身體任何部分的晶石的造成相同。造成這晶石的條件是：一個腔穴，盛有液體；這液體含有溶解的鹽：外來的物體走進這腔穴：液體的鹽沉聚在這物體周圍。所謂外來物體，就是由上皮表面感染細菌病而生的細菌及黏液斷片。要是晶石微小，它們就從腎臟沿輸尿管下降，或從膀胱沿尿道下降，造成比產婦陣痛更難受的疝痛。</p>
<p>尿中發見沉澱物，常使病人吃驚；其實這沉澱物大抵是由燐酸鹽或尿酸鹽積聚而成，爲普通人常有的現象。要是沉澱物是血或膿，那纔表示確實患病。某種毒癌的顯著症象是尿中帶血，肺結核會影響腎臟及膀胱。身體各部分的傳染病會使腎臟或腎孟生膿。須知尿液不但挾帶各部分尿道的痕跡，因而表現腎臟，輸尿管，膀胱，和尿道的情况，而且也是同化與代謝的終極產物，足以映照全身的健康狀况。</p>

<p>（問）急性關節風濕痺，心臟患的合併症，除了心內膜炎外，還有什麼疾患？</p>
<p>（答）還有心囊炎和心肌炎等。若全部心臟都患合併症時，呌做全心臟炎。</p>
<p>（問）發心臟合併症的病人，關節的症候，是否很重？</p>
<p>（答）凡發心臟合併症的病人，關節的風濕痺症候，却很輕。這因爲輕症的病人，最容易起床勞動，以致引起心悸亢進和呼吸困難。這時候心臟部便受害了。</p>
<p>（問）急性關節風濕痺，對於體內的腹膜</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>

<p>（答）　這種症候很少。問有起頭痛，昏矒　妄。這時候體溫昇上很高，有時達攝氏表三十四度，非當凶險。</p>
<p>（問）　小舞踏病怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　續發於關節部的病患。尤其在小兒最爲多見。也往往伴以心內膜炎的。</p>
<p>（問）　發生急性精神病的時候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）　病人大都發憂鬱症或精神錯亂症等</p>
<p>（問）　急性關節風濕痺，所發的症候，旣是非常繁多；除掉前述許多臟器之外，其他器管，可有什麼部分被侵的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）　肺臟被侵時，發生肺炎；腎臟被侵時，發生腎臟炎，都是危險的症候。</p>
<p>（問）　病人的脾臟，有什麽變化？</p>
<p>（答）　脾臟却不像其他急性傳染病時的那麽腫脹，所以可算沒有什麽變化。</p>

<p>（五十二）乳嘴突起炎</p>
<p>乳嘴突起炎，大都繼發於急性或慢性化膿性中耳炎。原發性的甚少。牠所發生的病象。頗易識別。就是乳嘴突起部（卽耳翼後方）發生腫脹發赤。有時腫脹可以波及顳顬部共顴骨部。因此往往引起眼瞼的浮腫。若用手指壓迫乳嘴突起部。或敲打該部。則患者感覺非常疼痛。在病勢劇烈的時候。卽使輕按該部。亦有不能耐的疼痛。外聽道的後上壁。漸次膨隆。耳漏亦復旺盛。全身症狀，則有發熱，煩燥，夜不安眠等等。若在乳嘴窩部位的骨膜下。形成膿瘍而尙未穿孔的時候。那就可於耳翼後方。觸知顯著的波動。耳翼亦因耳後皮膚的腫脹。聳立離開頭部。爲是本病的特狀（參閱附影）。</p>
<p>本病的病變。若進行不已。則乳嘴突起的骨壁。卽能崩壞而向外方穿孔。或向內方侵襲。她的穿孔部位。約有五處。卽（一）乳嘴窩部位——最多。（二）外聽道後壁——較多。（三）乳嘴突起尖端內壁——次之。（四）顴骨突起根部——次之。（五）向頭蓋內或迷路內穿孔——較少。乳嘴突起炎的預防法。最好就是在患有急性或慢性化膿性中耳炎的時候。應當卽速醫治中耳炎。以免病機蔓延。波及乳嘴突起。而發骨性病變。如果耳翼後方，一旦覺有腫脹及壓迫痛。就應該知道乳嘴突起部。已有炎症波及的傾向。此時若能謹愼施用消炎法。大都或可炎消腫退。若再遷延時期。不予治療。或遇體質衰弱而缺乏抵抗力的患者。勢必形成膿瘍。此時必須施行手術。方爲上策。否則種種危險。繼之以起。終至不可收拾。千祈注意爲要。茲爲引起議者諸位的興趣起見。特舉病例。略爲一述。並將患者的病容。攝有二影。一併刊出。以資參考。</p>
<p>患者　鄒某　男　六歲</p>

<p>直至本年五月。始則求治於中醫。旋卽於右耳後下部。起腫脹，疼痛，發熱。如是約經兩週。耳內流膿更劇。息者煩燥。夜不安眠。再經數日後。膿汁驟然减少。而該部腫脹反爲增劇。甚至波及右側眼瞼。現在耳後下部之腫脹更甚。耳內流膿亦更多。勢如泉湧。但眼瞼部之腫脹。業已减退。食慾亦尙佳。</p>

<p>其他種外痔如果疼痛最好治法是注射局部麻藥然後割去。不數日便可全愈，較比遲慢的擦藥治法好多倍了。</p>
<p>內痔是曲張大的靜脈管，位於肛門內一兩寸以上，其外皮是大腸內的粘膜，不是和體外皮膚相同。內痔的大小不等，小者如蠶豆，大者如小核桃。生痔瘡的原因不少，最要者如長期大便閉結，肝硬化，妊娠，骨盆內生瘤，與無論何種情形阻礙血由腹部流回就可以發痔瘡。</p>
<p>內痔輕者除大便時少痛外平常沒有疼痛，但大內痔有時　紐患者便疼痛難堪。大內痔也常在大便後脫出托回原處困難。如此每日痛苦可算是人力的一種大不幸。內痔也常被硬糞割破出血多少不等。</p>
<p>治療痔瘡有三種方法。第一種是外科以外的方法。减去痛苦第一須注意不使閉結。如果閉結痔瘡就容易長大，並且大便時也痛的厲害。患者如於每晚注入肛門內三四匙油（如橄欖油，花生油，菜籽油，蔴油礦油等）於痔有益。油可使糞鬆軟，同時滑潤，使痔瘡不受傷，流血疼痛都可大部分消除。如內服礦油一日三次滑動作用更要好些。</p>
<p>大便時痔瘡如果脫出疼痛，放回不易，可先用熱水洗痔瘡，洗後擦上油膏便容易托回原處。如果痔瘡痛可在痔瘡上擦止痛藥膏。用痔瘡藥梃也有些好處。如果第一法長久不能收全效須採以下方法：</p>

<p>除開腸結核外，其他的消化器管部分，也狠多發生結核性之變化的。像舌部，軟顆，咽頭，扁桃腺，等部分：在重症的肺結核患者，都可以發生結核性潰瘍的。這種種的合併痊，大半是預後不良的。此外，腹膜方面的結核，也是狠習見的；這是大半和腸結核症合併的。直腸方面的瘻管，以及膿瘍，也是帶結核性奢居多。胃部方面的結核性潰瘍，是比較最鮮見的，除開屍體解剖方面的證明外，臨床上是毫無覺着的。</p>
<p>第五節　肺部以外的呼吸器管——喉結核</p>
<p>在肺部以外的呼吸器官部分，也很容易被侵襲的；這裏面頂習見的，自不能不首推「喉結核」一症了！他是大半由病人的痰哩向上侵襲而致的；尋常以見於重症的開放性肺結核症爲多，滲出性和增生性兩種型式都屬可能的。在臨床上所發見的數計，大槪佔百分之二十五光景，病理上檢查報吿，尙不止此數。他的最初發生的地方，以喉腔後壁及聲帶爲多，喉頭軟骨的部分也是很習見的。—除開上述的次發性外，初發性的喉結核，並非完全不可能的，臨床上也有例蹬可援引的，祇是遠沒有前者之習見罷了！喉部之發生狼瘡症，事實上也是數見不鮮的；但他是完全由面部的狼瘡症侵襲而致，和肺結核症是毫無關係的；並且他的經過情形也是完全兩樣的，病理上的變化更屬不同，所以此處也一槪節去不談了！</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>或許是出於愛美的天性，或許是產自玩弄女性的劣根，在人類中很早就盛行着一種不自然的「女性崇拜」這種不自然的「女性崇拜」，其表露於一般社會現象，似乎是對女性加以讚美，又似乎是侮弄女性。如白樂天的長恨歌與琵琶行，一方面用回眸一笑百媚生·六宮粉黛無顏色」和「同楚天涯淪落人，相逢何必曾相識」的描寫下來表示一種「憐香惜玉」的心情·另一方面又以「漢皇重色思傾國」與「五陵年少爭纏頭」的語句，在婦女身上堆上許多罪惡。</p>
<p>其實這一種情形，是表面上帶着「崇拜女性」的幌子，而其實質則爲男子之「拜性狂」加上侮弄的心理。這一拜性狂的海弄心理。顯然因爲男女經濟地位的懸殊，而日益趨於熾盛。尤共在此日薄嶛嵫的末社會，更見流行，許多希望些忘去殘酷的現實的市民層，都相率奔入此途以尋找他們的新天地。影迷們之所以忙於寫信給電影明星，交際花之很爲許多人眼熱着迷。就在這不自然的「女性崇拜」中，風靡一時。</p>
<p>這種社會心理的弱點。爲一般具「生意眼」的人看中。便作爲以廣招徠的工具。小之如谷種物品之冠以「明星商標」，大之如「花樣翻新」的活廣告：時裝展覽會揭幕禮花瓶女推銷員等，均屬此類。此一事態度雖說具着充分「捧脚」式的侮弄性質，然而我們却有一部份婦女，竟恬然處之，甚至引以爲榮，實在是大可浩嘆的事。</p>
<p>最近江蘇省婦女會，以各地商號工廠利用婦女照片刋作廣告，不特有意汚辱女性，且奇形怪狀，羞態百出，關係風化甚鉅，特呈請省當局轉呈中央主管機關，通飭取締，殊不失爲一切中時弊之舉。不過我們認爲：取締固爲遏止之一法，但是這一侮辱女性的事件，是產生於已有侮辱女性習尙的環境，它的根本消滅。不僅在於取締「奇形怪狀」的廣告，且在於如何使侮辱女性之各種「奇形怪狀」的事實絕跡。而社會間不自然的「女性崇拜，」則爲侮辱女性的整體。</p>

<p>— 挺宜</p>
<p>延壽堂一十週紀念大减價的市招飛滿了廣闊的街衢，識得幾個斗大字的鄉下人，就朗聲高讀起來：「公宰梅花仙鹿，各種參燕銀耳大廉價。」</p>
<p>「見鬼！」一個同伴接著說：「這年頭兒喝粥都不容易，人參官燕，鬼才來上門！呢」</p>
<p>「城里財主人倒底多着！都是我們這些上典當的窮人，米店都要關門呢？」讀廣告的人感歎起來。</p>
<p>兩個小丑模樣的孩子走過他們身旁，黃馬甲上印着鮮紅的延壽堂三個大字，敲着一面大鼓緩緩地向前面走去。</p>
<p>這怪模怪樣的廣告術，似乎引動了這羣人的興趣。「還有贈品，或許空手帶一點東西回來」。心里想着，脚步已跟踪那兩個孩子向前踅去了。</p>
<p>延壽堂是本縣獨步的雙鋪面大藥堂，醫生看到重病總吩咐病家到延壽堂，好像他們那裏的藥材纔是道地貨。每年冬季×週紀念大减似，延壽堂的生意可以超過南貨店的。有大主顧上門的時候，經理宋先生親自捧茶敬烟，那種一團和氣的招待，據說一個冬季的生意可以兩倍於過去的三季。</p>
<p>可是這種盛况和太平年勢一樣的過</p>

<p>去了。</p>
<p>各種會業的太减價，已經沒有效力了。年荒兵亂，鄉下人自然喝粥都不容易，城里人同是外强中乾，對於麥燕銀耳的奢侈品，再要做往年一般的好生意，簡直是做夢了。</p>
<p>延壽堂一間舖面收歇了，租於一家終天奏着西樂隊的洋廣雜貨舖。宋先生耐不住那冷淸淸的店堂的時候，就據了水烟袋踅到他們店舖里談談。</p>
<p>西樂隊雖然聲嘶力竭地吹奏着，却難得有主顧上門來做一二毛錢的賣買。兩位經理先一談起來，總是搖頭歎氣。</p>
<p>「這種日用品都沒有買主，貴號生意自然更淸淡了。　雜貨店經理先生忽然覺得語氣太重，就故意打了個哈哈，接着說：「貴店生意總是不差吧？」</p>
<p>「市面不景氣，病人總是要請醫服藥的啊？」有一天宋先生槌着桌子喊起來了。</p>
<p>當天晚上，他邀請了各股東開秘密會議。</p>
<p>「年頭實在太壞了！」他開頭說：「隔壁京貨店里的日用品都沒有生意，但是我想……　他故意頓了頓，運用他精銳的目光掃過每個股東的面部，然後接着說：「我想，病倒底還是要生的，病人倒底還是要請醫服藥的，祇要我們眞正大减價，實行薄利主義，每天能够打出開消才是道理！」</p>
<p>「年勢眞是太壞了！」一個股東表示沒有意見。</p>
<p>「應該想個辦法……」</p>
<p>「是的。宋先生搶着接了另一個股東的語氧，「今年是二十週紀念，記得十週紀念那年做了上萬生意，宰了一頭梅花仙鹿，今年我想……」</p>
<p>「這我自有辦法。」宋先生故意放低了聲音，「我可以設法租一頭來裝個樣子，祇要我們做着生意，宰不宰有什麽關係？」</p>
<p>延壽堂往昔賺過錢，現在祇要股東不添本，由宋先生的主意行事了。</p>
<p>門外紮起電燈牌樓，京貨店里的西樂隊坐到他們舖堂來了。一個像狗一般大的梅花仙鹿掛了彩網，焚着麝香，供在大天井里，門外的人像看戲一般地湧擁着。</p>
<p>「什麽梅花仙鹿，比狗還小呢！」一個笑聲從人叢中送出來。</p>
<p>「哼！城里財主人多，你看罷，瞧熱鬧倒不少哩！」先前的那個鄉下人在背後探頭探腦地說。</p>
<p>「少管閑事吧！」讀廣吿的說：「到茶館里見了保正再說，這樣荒年荒勢還想買點補品回去孝你娘的鳥！」</p>

<p>深夜的時分、風像噴泉一般地灑在死去了的都會的街這上——雖說已經是炎熱的季候了；然而，在烏沈沈的深得不可懸想的夜晚，在大部份的人都向安息中去找尋僅僅在夢裏才能得到的平靜的時候，在一小部份的人正出沒在黑夜的世界裏，在企圖用兇暴與膽量去換些明日的麵包，或打算在鍍金的麻醉劑中去消化過飽的胃腸的這一段短短的一霎中，卽使在生長着椰子的曖味的南方，風是依然帶着一種力量——把流浪在黑夜裏的微小的靈魂吹得像大海中的孤帆船一樣地發抖的力量的！</p>
<p>夜是多恬靜，多悠長啊。世界烏黑地，廣闊地伸展在人底眼前。街是顯然疲乏得失了神采；而人，依然是流浪在夜的荒街上，在留神每一個過路人，每一個巡捕，與每一個可以當作閉一下眼睛而倚一下的陰暗的街角。已經是整整的三四個晝夜了，失了神，失了理智，失了意念，也失了作爲生活之原料的麵包皮；於是，便開始呆呆地滯立在荒涼而又小氣的街上，用着一種生疏的，好奇的，也像是極不能了解的眼睛看來去的行人，看店，看衣着與食品（這些，全是被緊緊地保存在玻璃窗裏，當作對從生活之高塔上跌落下來的生物之誇耀的。）；一陣不可抑止的，像呑噬着人底心臟一樣的飢餓的火熖升起來了，然而依舊是遊魂股地追逐着路上的人，哀求着，把苦與飢餓的描述用了最詳細的句子叙說出來，請求每一個人底些微的施與。飢餓的刑罰是難受的，飢餓的力量是大得沒有方法抑止的；正像洪流推動着發電機的轉輪一樣，飢餓也動推動了人底生活的勇敢；說乞取是一千種的恥辱吧，如果眞的是那樣，那未從人類以至其他的生物，在將給飢餓的火焰所燃化，所毀滅的一煞間，是有理由來忍受這說不盡的凌虐與恥辱的　——難道說，「要治」遠不是一個最大而最充分的不可反馭的理由嗎？</p>
<p>大街上是那樣地熱閙；可是人們底心是依然這樣地荒凉啊；在誇耀的神中，他們是曾經高貴地把厭恨與卑視拋向乞食人的身上去的。這樣，給飢餓的火焰所燃燒着的乞食人底幼小的靈魂，在朝夜地忍着恥辱。忍着最難忍受的一切，訴說着又求吿着，所得到的施與，依然不是生命的延續，而相反地，却是無數的恥辱的彙集與累積了。這世界可眞怪呢。</p>
<p>（夜深得不能測想，世界也像落進黑夜裏去了。在這時候，人生活着該是多艱難的事業啊；人得向世界去乞憐，去要求，去吿訴；然而，在多風雨的季候中，連這都失去了效用了呢。</p>
<p>幾年來，大街依然是大街；然而却添上了多少給飢餓所磨折着的行乞人啊：枯瘦的可是年紀正輕着的漢子，站着打抖的白髮的老婦，他們底命運，都是命定着該忍受多量的恥辱的吧？然而，想一想！在一些較輕鬆的過往的時日中，誰又不曾看到過大鵝絨一般的日子呢？</p>
<p>而現在是，必需每天每天，在街的每一角，去用恥辱與別人底同情來換取可怕的食糧了。）</p>
<p>乞食人學會了較大的忍受，與較可怕的流浪了。「蓮花落」的板子上所打出的聲音，並不歡笑，而是向世界的求乞啊！</p>

<p>從海面飄　的風　是悒鬱的，好像要把世界都染上了這悶悶的氣息一樣，又好像是從南太平洋上飄過來的風。</p>
<p>土敏土結成的碼頭上靠着欄杆眺望出去是廣闊的海面。</p>
<p>這里有着帝國的權威的旗旌，在巨大的軍艦上給風飄揚，透出來的聲息好像是驕傲地：「蘊藏着富源的海濱的澳門。」這兒儘是提着白色的鬼　，白色的一切，又好像在暴的風帶　汹湧的　濤，一切都要估　懦弱得像一匹巨大的瞌睡着的獅子的支那。、</p>

<p>然而，六月的風吹襲着南國的一切，好像有無數的安閒的人們要打瞌睡似浮游，貧婪地流浪。這正是表現了他們將要給太陽燒得要死去一樣，散漫，懶惰，一種祖宗上遺傳下來的風格，哪兒曉得安閒的世界已到了末日，就是愛國的高調盪漾地遍了他們不幸的家鄉，他們也許疲乏地：「天氣眞厭悶，誰有工夫管他媽的末日或將來呢？」於是，把昏眩的腦袋，埋進了充塞着金錢的光茫的跟蘊藏着殺人的氣味兒的賭塲里，從白天到夜里，好像滾流着的大每水一樣沒有停息的度過了他們的末日的沒落的生活，或者是瘦得像一把乾柴似的沒勁的身體倒在高枕的黑色的香味的烟室里，那兒瞧不見太陽，瞧不見國家的風雲，那兒儘是「囉—囉」的吸着鴉片，從白天到夜里，只要把要滅亡的身體倒埋在這凄切的圈子里，或是是把年靑的康健的身體，迷在儘是豐腴的女人的膀子里，美麗的南國的女兒，她們會張着塗滿了脂粉的臉孔，嘴唇，把世界末日的憂鬱靑年迷惑着，他們沉醉在這個圈子里，也許感不到六月的厭膩；然而，從那兒透出來的香水的氣息還未消散，帶着臭爛了的病體又悄悄地在黑夜里投進那永遠塡不滿的深淵里去了。</p>
<p>那應不淸楚的糢糊的畫面，給人們感到除了黏膩的氣息，只是皆狂，迷惑，飄盪，或是沉醉的舞塲里，響着悠相的曲子，忘掉世界的風雲的男女緊貼地鯈抱着在跳。一切的一切都是向黑的海水里埋葬呵。</p>

<p>將軍深知欲求波蘭之自由，祇有仰賴于武力，因開始計劃秘密組織義勇軍，此實爲一最艱巨之工作，處層層束縛，帝俄淫威之下，以赤手空拳謀組成武力團體，卽其國人亦咸認此舉徒然犧牲，于事無補。將軍敎育之，解釋之，同時積極組織之，卒成爲後日波蘭著名義勇軍，奪得波蘭自由。將軍預知歐戰必將爆發，訓練此義勇軍益勤，數年如一日，及一九一四年戰鼓四起，將軍乃率此義勇軍加入作戰，迭獲勝利，將軍聲名始著，其後德奧聯軍欲利用其軍隊，將軍毅然拒絕，德軍設計將其軍隊繳械，各軍官分送德各砲毫監禁，將軍亦被執，拘禁于漢堡砲臺的陸軍監獄中。</p>
<p>大戰告終，德國革命，將軍始被釋，在全國民衆夾道歡呼聲中遄返華沙。其時波蘭雖以將軍的奮鬥結果，獲得自由獨立，但是各事混亂，政黨派克紛岐，互相猜忌仇視，無政府，無軍警，無資金，一切無組織，將軍卽銳意整頓內政，首先組織政府和國會，規定全國凡二十一歲的國民，不論性別宗敎均有選舉權，將軍被國會舉爲元首，並委他做大元帥，統轄全國軍隊。</p>

<p>湯傑正在集中全力分鏡頭，可以說每一鏡頭，是他每一滴心血所化成的，他竭希望「王先生到農村去」這部片子，將來成爲新時代的代表作。</p>
<p>「王先生到農村去」是有聲影片，仍由湯傑曹雪松黃耐霜等原班人馬主演，初審劇本，現已送京審查，待獲通過，卽行開攝云。</p>

<p>「大家庭」中有五對兄弟妯娌，大哥王獻齋，大嫂宣景琳，這一對可算配得恰到好處，才貌相等。哥龔稼農，這傢伙在表面上看起來，倒是一個十足道地的老實人，但他有兩位妻子，一個是黃耐霜，一個是朱秋痕，動不動就大打出手，爭風吃醋趣事多。三哥孫敏，三嫂葉秋心，這一對給任何人看見了，也要呌一句不良的壞東西，說句眞心話，他倆實在是一對犬大的好人，後來他們分了家，被王獻齋，龔稼農，騙到上海來，做金子交易的的生意，弄得傾家蕩產，一文不名。老四高占非和老五趙丹都是光棍條的獨身兒，當大年夜五對兄弟，除夕團拜的時候，大家都同自己的妻子同拜，而老四老五沒有女人，他倆只好配爲一對，同拜祖宗，其後老四高占非也和高倩蘋結婚了。這一來光棍條，只剩下趙丹一人了，但他並不懊惱，他知道他還年靑，他得在這年靑的時候，多得一點書，結果他的哥哥們，都弄得傾家蕩產，只有他一人安居樂業，但他們也覺悟了，不應當慕虛榮貪財，自私自利，要分家，而跑到這虛僞的上海來，唉！於是他們都回到鄕下去，做農村工作去了。</p>
<p>看了以上五位兄弟有趣的故事，我們就可以知道「大家庭」之優越的內容了。這兒的演員，差不多包括了明星公司的全體明星，爲張石川編劇導演。</p>
<h3 id="c201">電通兩導演一粗一細司徒慧敏與袁牧之 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>「自由神」導演司徒慧敏，嘴闊面方，臉常笑了，眼睛會跟人打招呼，攝影塲上穿一套黃卡旗的工作衣，學過畫，做過佈景師，對錄音面研究，更是專家，故預料「自由神」的畫面興錄音，必有美滿的成績，此外，對導演大塲面的羣衆戲，亦極有控制的力量，頗有「粗細條」</p>
<p>至於「都市風光」的導演袁牧之，是戲劇界最講究演技的人，自「都市風光」開工後，他的鬈頭髮已剪掉，態度瀟酒，整日在攝影塲上用心思，專注意佈景和鏡頭的地位，跟任何人要說說笑話，他痕室裏有一座鋼琴，就寢前，起身後，必可可咚咚地奏幾曲，在拍戲時，每個鏡頭要試許多次，使演員的演技有純熟的表演，演員雖然暗中叫苦，他却感到特別有趣，這該是他的「細　　」作風了，我想一種諷剌的喜劇，更需要這種工夫吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Preliminary Contact Regarding the Chahar Affair; Meeting Time and Location Still Undecided; Qin Dechun Resigns as Acting Chairman of Chahar, Enters German Hospital for Recuperation, Claims to Advance and Retreat with Song Zheyuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying arrived in Beiping last night from Hankou. He had a long talk with Qin that night and visited Mr. Qin again at 7:00 this morning. At 8:45, he went to Tianjin to see Song. He did not stay in Tianjin for long and is scheduled to return to Beiping tonight. The time and place for Qin Dechun to meet with Matsui has not yet been decided. According to Matsui's statements, the Zhangbei issue is completely different from the Hebei issue. The Zhangbei issue does not involve any constraints. Once negotiations begin, it should be easily resolved. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Deshen telegraphed the government and the Executive Yuan this morning, earnestly resigning from the position of acting chairman, requesting that another capable person be appointed, and also requesting that they convey his request to the central government and approve his request. Qin then immediately entered the German Hospital for recuperation and a physical examination. Initial contact has been made regarding the Zhangbei incident, but the representatives of both sides have not yet agreed on a time and place to meet. Qin Dechun's telegram formally resigning as acting chairman stated: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing. I recently transferred from Zhangjiakou and received a telegram ordering me, Dechun, to temporarily serve as the chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government. I am extremely apprehensive and fearful. I, Dechun, have long served in the military and have little experience in political affairs. In recent years, I have followed Chairman Song, and have been entrusted with the responsibility of governing the people, long suffering the criticism of holding a position without merit. Now that a new appointment has been issued, I am at a loss for words and dare not forget my limited talents, recklessly occupy a high position, and fall into error, causing the state to worry. I hereby telegraph my earnest resignation, humbly requesting that you withdraw the decree and appoint another capable person. I anxiously await your orders." Qin Dechun bows respectfully. Before entering the German Hospital this morning, Qin issued a written statement saying, "The National Government appointed me to temporarily serve as the chairman of Chahar. The original order only arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou yesterday. I personally feel that my talents are insufficient. I have followed Chairman Song for many years, and will advance and retreat together with him. I absolutely dare not accept the new position. I have already telegraphed the central government requesting that it withdraw its order. As for the Chahar affair, in order to promote good neighborliness and ensure local peace, I should, in accordance with the central government's instructions, promptly handle it to a conclusion." (23rd Dispatch)</p>

He and Huang will both go north soon to handle military and political affairs in North China. Negotiations on the Chahar affair will soon be conducted in Beiping.

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the upgrade of the Tianjin Municipal Government's organization, the Municipal Government has convened meetings of secretaries and section chiefs for several consecutive days, but opinions have not yet been unified. Shang Zhen believes that the current municipal organization is already in line with a Class A city, but the municipal treasury is in deficit, and since it has not been exempted from the monthly subsidy to the Military Council and the Hebei Provincial Government, it cannot afford to expand. Therefore, he intends to adjust the current state of the various bureaus so that they truly conform to the organization of a Class A city. The issue of the jurisdiction of the police power of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the three special districts has not been resolved, and the director of the Public Security Bureau and the heads of the three special districts are still responsible for discussing solutions and submitting them to the Municipal Council for review.

<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone report from Miyun, at 10:00 PM on the 22nd, more than 40 bandits suddenly invaded the Niulanyu area, 30 miles from Miyun, from Xinglong County. They were wearing casual clothes in yellow and blue colors and were carrying various large and small guns. They robbed and kidnapped people along the way, demanding ransom. Ren Zhengming, the leader of the second detachment of the second regiment of the Miyun Defense Corps, upon hearing the news, led his troops to meet them head-on and injured seven bandits on the spot. The bandits, unable to withstand the attack, fled towards the direction of the intersection of Huai and Shun.

<p>(Hong Kong) Haiqi and Haishen continued to send personnel to Ninghai on the 23rd to discuss with Chen Jiliang, and the result is said to be satisfactory. Tang Jinghai stated in a written statement on the 23rd that Zeng Zhaoqiong will arrive in Beijing on the 24th to negotiate the voyage of the Haiqi and Haishen and will await his reply. In the future, the central government may send a senior official to lead them or order them to return north with the Ninghai, which is welcomed. Rumors that the Hong Kong government has ordered the Haiqi and Haishen to leave the country are not accurate. Guangdong has requested the return of the anti-aircraft guns and other military equipment used to replenish the Haiqi and Haishen. Over a hundred soldiers of the Zhaozu were dismissed on the 20th and sent back to their hometowns with provincial funds. The ship has been converted into a naval school training ship and does not have a captain. Fang Nianzu has been appointed as the administrator. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Nanjing's denial of the blockade of Guangzhou by the fleet has reassured people here. Those in charge are convinced that the northern ships are only coming south to escort the Haiqi and Haishen to Nanjing, to prevent them from going elsewhere en route. At the time of the mutiny of the two ships, there were about 50 Cantonese trainees imprisoned on the ships. They were only released in Hong Kong. These people arrived in the province this afternoon and went to the headquarters to await orders. There are still 40 trainees detained on the mutiny ships, who will probably only be released after the Guangdong authorities release Jiang Xiyuan. The Japanese official has protested to the provincial authorities that the Huangpu and Humen fortresses announced a state of emergency on the night of the mutiny without giving warning, causing one Japanese warship and one Japanese ship to enter the danger zone. Jiang Guangnai, the former commander of the 19th Route Army, has now suddenly arrived in the province. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Haiqi and Haishen are anchored today between the Ninghai and Tongji ships, with a British destroyer alongside.

<h3 id="e23">Early Summer Rainfall and Flood/Drought Disasters <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>-- A Year</p>
<p>A week ago, when this reporter returned to his hometown for personal matters, he saw that the rice seedlings in eastern Zhejiang had just been planted and needed water for irrigation, but the weather was clear and hot, with little rainfall, unlike the typical weather of the rainy season. Having witnessed the farmers in his hometown using waterwheels and fearing drought, and recalling the great drought that began in eleven provinces at this time last year, he could not help but feel saddened. After finishing his business and returning to Shanghai, he encountered continuous rain and heard that the residents of the city were suffering from the rain and fearing the inevitable flood disaster.</p>
<p>Will the weather this summer, as generally feared, cause flood and drought disasters that will harm agriculture? Or will we be fortunate enough to have adequate rainfall and temperature to supplement the harvest? This depends on the changes in air pressure and other sky phenomena. Predictions cannot be relied upon, and worry or joy is in vain. What this reporter can do today is to interpret the facts for the reference of those who are concerned about agriculture: (1) The early summer in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is usually the time with the most rainfall, with a standard rainfall of 185 millimeters. Last June, according to the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, only 42 millimeters were recorded, only 23% of the standard rainfall, resulting in a severe drought. This year, according to yesterday's report in this newspaper, nearly four inches of rain, about 100 millimeters, have already fallen from the 16th to the 22nd. Adding the rainfall on the 23rd, the amount is no longer small. If the rainfall from the 23rd onwards does not exceed 85 millimeters, it will not be excessive. If the rainfall increases further, human efforts to drain the water will have to be prepared. (2) According to yesterday's report in this newspaper, the continuous heavy rain was caused by a low pressure system moving east from Jiangxi. This is consistent with the normal phenomena of the rainy season. The rainy season in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is caused by the collision of a high-pressure system coming from the Arctic Ocean via the waters near Japan and a warm air current coming from the south, creating storms. The usual pattern of its movement is eastward or northeastward. Last year, due to a change in the direction of the high-pressure system, there was no rainy season in Jiangnan, resulting in an abnormal situation. This year, judging from the continuous east wind bringing rain, the weather seems to be returning to normal. This should be reassuring for our farmers.</p>
<p>This reporter does not have in-depth knowledge of meteorology, but when he was in his hometown, he was often asked, "Will there be another drought this year?" After returning to Shanghai, he often heard talk that "this year may turn into a flood disaster." Therefore, he used the meteorological records in this newspaper's yearbook and interpreted the facts for the readers. Although the disasters of flood and drought are related to weather regulation, flood and drought are also related to human affairs. For example, last summer, the rainfall was scarce in the south but abundant in the north. The rainfall in North China was not excessive, but because the river channels of the Hai River system had been neglected and silted up for years, it resulted in a flood disaster. The past is like a mirror, and the people of the country should learn from it. Also, the United States suffered from a drought disaster at the same time as we did last summer. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster were only slightly less than ours. U.S. President Roosevelt, in addition to allocating disaster relief funds, also issued an order to encourage tree planting for drought prevention. This is also something that our authorities should emulate.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Conclusion of Anglo-French Talks: Eden Proceeds to Rome, to Meet Italian Premier Mussolini Today, Reassuring France of Compliance with London Declaration <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden concluded his talks and departed for Rome at 10 PM this evening. Regarding the outcome of the talks, it is generally believed that Premier Laval firmly stated that the proposals contained in the February 3rd London Declaration (i.e., Sky-Locarno Pact, Danube Pact, Eastern European Pact, and the lifting of restrictions on German armaments) are interrelated. Although separate negotiations can be held, no firm decisions can be made on any one of them without substantial progress in negotiations. It is said that Eden accepted this approach from France, and Britain will not conclude a separate pact with Germany regarding the Sky Pact. As for the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, Eden and Laval did not discuss it. It is rumored that if Eden can reach any peaceful solution with Italian Premier Mussolini after arriving in Rome, France will gladly support it. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Themes of Anglo-Italian Talks</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, a spokesperson for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they hope the results of Eden's visit to Italy this time will reaffirm the national unity displayed by Britain, France, and Italy at the Stresa Conference. Eden will hold talks with Italian Premier Mussolini here on Sunday, and will continue on Tuesday if necessary. The main issue to be discussed is the current naval situation, but the Western European Sky Pact and the Danube Conference will also be touched upon. Although political circles say that the Abyssinian issue will not be discussed by both sides, there are concerns that it will not be mentioned at all. Britain's conclusion of a naval agreement with Germany has naturally caused surprise in Italy. However, judging from the phenomenon, the Italian government can also understand Britain's pragmatic actions. It is now believed that the Italian government's views on the naval issue are roughly as follows: (1) Naval restrictions have so far been based on the Treaty of Versailles, and Italy may now need to expand its navy, especially when France is expanding. (2) Italy is willing to send naval experts to participate in the preliminary meetings in the near future to prepare for the holding of a full naval conference. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Italy's Stance</p>
<p>(Rome) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden is expected to arrive here around 7 PM today and will begin talks with Italian Premier Mussolini tomorrow. According to semi-official sources, the Abyssinian issue may affect the future development of Anglo-Italian negotiations, and whether there will be any changes in Anglo-Italian relations will depend on Britain's attitude towards Italy's war in East Africa. However, the Italo-Abyssinian dispute will not be involved in this Anglo-Italian talk. As for Italy's stance in this Anglo-French talk, according to semi-official sources, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Italy believes that the recently signed Anglo-German naval agreement contradicts the principles of the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations, and is contrary to the united front of Britain, France, and Italy established at the Stresa Conference. As for the British government's claim that Italy should first absolutely fulfill the principles decided by the League of Nations on the Abyssinian issue, and then keep all Italian troops stationed in Europe in order to fulfill the obligations stipulated by the Stresa Conference, the Italian side believes that this argument is weak. Moreover, France's attitude towards Britain's claim is quite firm, thus strengthening Italy's position. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Laval Eden Communiqué: Both Parties Conducted Detailed Research on Close Cooperation Methods Based on the London Declaration; The Core Issue Does Not Seem to Be Completely Resolved <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The results of the two-day talks between British Minister Without Portfolio Eden and French Premier Laval have completely eliminated the obstacles in Anglo-French relations. After the talks ended this afternoon, Laval issued a communiqué, stating that he had exchanged various useful explanations with the British Minister regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement. He continued, "We further discussed the European issues caused by the current international situation. We studied the ways in which our two governments should cooperate based on the February 3rd London Communiqué. We feel that we should seek practical plans to solve the problems discussed in London. This issue is not only beneficial to our two countries, but also to other European countries. Eden has informed his government of our suggestions. When he returns from Rome, I will meet again. Eden and I agree that France and Britain must remain loyal to the common responsibility and work of closely managing European peace through the collective security organization."</p>
<p>It is rumored that Eden made Laval understand regarding the naval issue that the Anglo-German naval agreement allows France complete freedom to increase its naval strength at will, and the French Premier did not reveal any intention to do so. Both parties did not mention the Abyssinian issue at all. Anglo-French political circles seem very pleased with the results of Eden's trip today. Before Eden departed for Rome at night, he received a reply from London, allowing him to assure Laval that the British government is willing to deal with the issues raised in the February 3rd London Declaration as soon as possible. The second step now is to agree on the best method to move things forward. Eden has submitted a suggestion on this matter to London and still needs the approval of the British Cabinet. The Cabinet will make a decision in time so that Eden can respond to Laval when he returns from Rome on Thursday. Eden's suggestion has not been criticized by the British Foreign Office, which can be regarded as a good sign that it will be approved by the Cabinet. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources here today, British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden and French Premier Laval have failed to reach an understanding because France still deeply resents the Anglo-German agreement. However, Laval is prepared to meet again after Eden goes to Italy and consults with Mussolini. Eden said that he was very satisfied with the talks. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Naval Issue: British Reply to France Explains the Reasons for Compromising with Germany Alone; Willing to Cooperate to Consolidate the Collective Security System <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement, the French government previously sent a note to the British government on the 17th, raising some objections. The British government recently prepared a written reply today, stating that Britain still agrees with the proposals contained in the February 3rd London Declaration. The Anglo-German naval agreement is integrated with the basic points of this declaration. The German rearmament of the navy was the result of the country's unilateral action, not the result of the Anglo-German agreement, and the Anglo-German agreement aims to limit German naval armaments. Britain's current policy on naval issues has always advocated separate talks. Moreover, the naval restriction issue did not come from the February 3rd London Declaration. It is an extension of the Washington Naval Treaty. Although Britain is willing to cooperate with France and Italy and conclude the Sky-Locarno Pact and the Eastern European Pact to consolidate the collective security system, it is also unwilling to delay naval disarmament due to the suspension of other negotiations. This is why it held separate negotiations with Germany and reached an agreement. The British government hopes that the French government can send naval representatives to London to prepare for a future general conference on naval issues. The British reply mentioned the Soviet Navy at the end, saying that as long as the Soviet shipbuilding program proceeds without violating the norm, there is no need to worry about Germany expanding its navy again.

<p>(London) The German naval representative invited British delegates to a luncheon at the Carlton Hotel today. Those attending the luncheon included British Foreign Secretary Hall, Fleet Commander Jupiel, Undersecretary Kreich, Admiral Liddell, and other senior officials. Those attending on the German side included Ambassador Hosch, Counselor Bismarck, Military Counselor Schebenburg, and many other embassy staff. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) German naval envoy Ribbentrop recently made a statement to our correspondent on the Anglo-German naval agreement, saying, "The naval talks have achieved good results, and the agreement has been concluded because of the foresight of Führer Hitler and senior officials of the British government. It is gratifying. Looking back on international talks over the years, there have been many. Cabinet ministers of various countries have traveled to other countries' capitals, but few have achieved anything. This Anglo-German naval agreement is the first success and the first step in the progress of arms limitation. As the saying goes, 'Don't bite off more than you can chew.' Europe is suffering from this problem. There are about two main points: (1) Various problems must be resolved in order, but countries want to solve them all at once. (2) All relevant countries gather together to solve all problems at the same time. This is like climbing a tree to catch fish." Ribbentrop also said that Germany believes that establishing peace must be based on the realization of the situation. Issues related to the interests of survival should be resolved through bilateral agreements. As for multilateral talks, Germany cannot agree to them because they have not achieved anything. After the naval issues between Britain and Germany are resolved this time, the situation between the two countries has been clarified, and there is hope for the solution of all other issues. "After the Anglo-German naval agreement is concluded, the European situation will be stabilized. Germany believes that Europe should take on a major mission in the civilized world. Britain, France, Germany, and other European countries must unite to maintain European culture. In short, Europe and the British Empire must continue to strengthen themselves. This is what Germany firmly believes." Ribbentrop then mentioned that some newspapers criticized Germany for improperly alienating Britain and France, saying that "those who make this statement have outdated minds and are indescribable. It is not something that Germans can understand. It is not false to say that I have devoted my life to the cooperation of Britain, France, and Germany, so that other countries can participate calmly. The cooperation of Britain, France, and Germany is the best thing at the moment. I firmly believe in this." (Havas, 22nd)</p>

As for the rumors that Secretary of State Hull told British Ambassador Lindsay that the United States believes the Anglo-German naval agreement is acceptable, the State Department has denied it, saying that the British Ambassador did not discuss the Anglo-German naval agreement with Hull or Phillips. No one at the State Department has approved or criticized this agreement. The U.S. State Department has always believed that the security issues of European countries are internal European affairs and have no direct relationship with the United States. This view has not changed at present. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of State Phillips informed the British government today that the United States hopes that the Anglo-German naval agreement can open the way for general naval restrictions. Phillips did not criticize the agreement. The U.S. State Department is currently taking a wait-and-see policy on the security issue negotiations currently being held in Europe and is closely watching them. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Britain Wants to Convene a Naval Conference in October, Expanding the Scope to Invite Russia, France, and Italy to Participate; Britain and the United States Attempt to Create a Common Front; Tokyo Is Deeply Wary <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government is eager to convene a naval conference in October this year. This can be seen from the hasty invitation to naval experts from France, Italy, and Russia to hold talks in Britain. Although experts from France, Italy, and Russia may not come to Britain in a short period of time, the British government will continue to work tirelessly. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the Anglo-German naval agreement has been successful, Britain has begun to negotiate with France. Italy and Soviet Russia will also be persuaded separately. After the European naval issue is resolved, Britain attempts to open up the situation of the Anglo-American-Japanese preliminary negotiations that are currently in recess. If the future Anglo-American-Japanese naval conference breaks down due to the different claims of the three countries, Britain and the United States will create a common front, mutually notifying each other of their plans for the number of ships to be built several years in advance, and make a gentleman's agreement to replace the disarmament agreement. There are many signs of this kind of strategy. The Japanese Navy believes that this method will not achieve the purpose of disarmament and holds the following views:</p>
<p>(1) If the disarmament conference breaks down, there will be no treaty status after 1937. At that time, if the European-centered solution proposed by Britain is adopted, Japan will be responsible for the Far East, the United States will be responsible for North and South America, and Britain will be responsible for Europe. The best strategy is to establish a non-threatening and non-aggressive disarmament agreement between the three countries and then discuss the establishment of a naval agreement between the three countries. However, to establish a non-threatening and non-aggressive agreement between the three countries, the restriction method advocated by Japan must be adopted. (1) A gentleman's agreement to declare shipbuilding is equivalent to informing warriors of how to win. Therefore, implementing the declaration first is equivalent to notifying the other party of the winning method. In short, it is naturally instigating the arrogance of expanding armaments, so it is difficult to accept. (Dentsu, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Russian Newspaper Discusses the Anglo-German Agreement <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Moscow Daily said in an editorial on the Anglo-German naval agreement, "If Britain truly believes the declarations of some British politicians that the London Agreement can lead to arms reduction and naval restriction and promote a broad disarmament conference, this kind of fantasy has no basis." "Let us not forget (Britain is now willing to forget this) that the rearmament of a country that intends to invade (whose leaders clearly and even openly admit this at times) will inevitably cause other countries to become more vigilant and strive for countervailing forces in armaments."</p>
<p>"We cannot calculate the armaments of various countries arithmetically. Hitler's 4,000-ton navy is essentially equal to the 8,000-ton navy of a country that does not intend to invade. If it is said that the work of the Geneva disarmament was obstructed and there was no result because Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, this kind of statement is also futile."</p>
<p>"If other countries can agree on the principle of how much to reduce armaments, then even if Germany opposes it, an agreement can be established. The real reason for the lack of practical results in the disarmament issue lies in the lack of security guarantees. After the party that advocates aggression and violence obtained political power in Germany, this difficulty became more and more obvious."</p>
<p>"The London Agreement did not increase the degree of consolidation of the sense of security. This sense took the actual work of reducing armaments as its prerequisite. The pre-agreement will definitely give a severe blow to the joint efforts of various countries to establish an agreement based on the principle of collective security. Hitler is trying to disperse the great powers and destroy their mutual trust. We cannot deny that Hitler has achieved partial success in this point. Because Britain did not obtain the consent of the countries participating in the recent various agreements and consultations, it has concluded an arms agreement with Germany alone. This kind of separate negotiation that destroys the collective security system directly violates the principles of the League of Nations."</p>
<p>"The London Agreement has caused concern among the Soviet people because the fate of the Soviet country is closely related to peace and deduces international events from the perspective of peaceful interests." "In this suffocating today, European countries that are determined to continue to engage in peace work and guarantee it must not only consolidate their international defenses to resist the growing crisis of aggression, but also redouble their efforts in the close cooperation of all countries that sincerely advocate peace and the collective security system." A government communiqué included an article in which the famous Soviet journalist Radek discussed the Anglo-German naval agreement, saying,</p>
<p>"Great Britain, despite France's protests, has engaged in two-sided naval negotiations with Germany and has concluded a naval agreement. In other words, the will of Great Britain to work together on a collective peace organization, as expressed in the February 3 document, has been abandoned." "The reason for Great Britain's actions may be a feeling of its own weakness, because Germany's air force has become stronger than Britain's, which was beyond Britain's expectations, or because Britain is willing to sign a separate agreement with Germany (Germany's strength has made Eden succumb). This intention has taken precedence in British policy." Radek concluded, "Any one of the two makes European peace full of crisis." (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Explanation from Warsaw <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw: The Anglo-German naval agreement is generally interpreted here as an important step for Germany to realize complete equal rights. A reporter for the government newspaper Polish Mail in Berlin claimed that the German Foreign Ministry hopes to convene an international conference in a short period of time to revise the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, Germany will also request the following: (1) Obtaining colonial mandate rights. (2) All clauses of the treaty that attribute war responsibility to Germany should be revoked. (3) All clauses of the treaty that give international characteristics to the Rhine, Oder, and Elbe rivers should be abolished. (4) War reparations should be explicitly canceled. Note that the Rhine River originates in Switzerland, runs along the border between France and Germany, passes through the Netherlands and enters the North Sea. The Oder River originates in the Czech Republic, passes through central Germany from the northwest and enters the North Sea. The Elbe River originates in southwestern Poland and enters Germany, passing through the province of West Silesia and flowing into the Baltic Sea from the northwest. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Paris) The claim by the French newspapers that, according to the Anglo-German naval agreement, Germany's naval combat power will soon exceed that of France, so France must immediately build new ships has been completely denied by a senior official of the Navy Department in a statement published in the Navy Department's newspaper. He also claimed that Germany's naval strength would not exceed that of France under any circumstances, because the total tonnage of German warships is not enough for the tonnage of French first-line warships, and the total tonnage of German light cruisers is also lower than that of French cruisers of the same class. The statement said that the total tonnage of the French Navy is equal to half of the British Navy, so there is no danger of an arms race for the time being. As for the claim that the French Navy is outdated, it is not worth laughing at. In fact, the French Navy is very new and strong, and all naval personnel are well-trained. There are currently 146,000 tons under construction, and two ships will be completed soon. The parliament has also approved the addition of two 35,000-ton cruisers, which can be started when necessary. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Archduke Albrecht of Hungary Will Divorce His Wife to Obtain the Throne <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Archduke Albrecht of Hungary will soon divorce his wife. This move is related to the Hungarian restoration issue and is noteworthy. Archduke Albrecht was born in 1897 and is a fourth cousin of Archduke Vodo of the Habsburg imperial family of Austria-Hungary. However, according to general proof, Albrecht has the blood of the old Abat dynasty. The Abat dynasty conquered Hungary in the 10th century AD and established itself as king. Its national destiny ended in the 14th century AD and has since disappeared without a trace. Recently, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös made a declaration in Congress, calling Albrecht the direct descendant of the Abat dynasty and advocating that he be welcomed as the King of Hungary, so that Hungary would have an independent monarch and would not be ruled by the Habsburg imperial family. However, Archduke Vodo of the Habsburg imperial family did not approve. Archduke Vodo is determined to restore the Austro-Hungarian dynasty, so he does not want Hungary to establish its own monarch. Moreover, Archduke Albrecht married Mrs. Trutner, a Hungarian diplomat, in 1930. Mrs. Trutner is not of noble birth and cannot be crowned queen according to the example. Therefore, if Albrecht wants to obtain the Hungarian throne, he must divorce his wife first. In 1934, Albrecht filed for divorce. At that time, Archduke Vodo promised to petition the Maro Church Court to cancel the marriage on his behalf, but only on the condition that Albrecht give up the Hungarian throne, so it failed. It has now been found that when Albrecht and Mrs. Trutner married in Blatton in accordance with civil law procedures on July 16, 1930, Mrs. Trutner had not yet dissolved her marriage with her original husband. According to church law, her second marriage should be considered invalid. Therefore, Archduke Albrecht will soon be able to divorce Mrs. Trutner. If so, it will reduce a difficulty in obtaining the Hungarian throne. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e36">Japanese Military Argues Against Relaxing Defense Against Russia; Cannot Reduce Military Spending Due to the Conclusion of the Non-Aggression Pact; Minister of the Army Hayashi Will Attend Cabinet Deliberation Meeting to Explain <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issues raised by Finance Minister Takahashi at the second Cabinet deliberation meeting regarding the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the balance between national defense and finance have become important current matters. Therefore, future progress is highly valued. The Army authorities plan to express their views on the above-mentioned issues at the next meeting, to be held on the 28th. The development of these important issues is highly noteworthy. The general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The world believes that the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact will immediately lead to a reduction in armaments. However, this idea is a big mistake. National defense is permanent in nature. If national defense is weakened by the treaty, then such arguments must be said to be dangerous. Regarding the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the diplomatic authorities have explained it repeatedly. The first priority is to resolve the pending issues between the two countries. (2) The balance between finance and armaments is also hoped for by the Army. They will not lag behind. However, when discussing this issue, if the attitude is based on not increasing the issuance of public bonds and not increasing taxes, then it cannot be approved. The current world situation is extremely serious, and the situation will become increasingly urgent in the future. Moreover, in terms of Japan's national conditions, the emergency situation has not yet been resolved. At this time, when armaments must be strengthened, it cannot be considered an impossible fact. Therefore, the Army, in the face of this unavoidable international situation of strengthening armaments, if it wants to maintain the balance of finance, it will not be the so-called sound finance of the past, but will deal with this issue with a more positive meaning. In order to promote the active development of finance, it is necessary to increase the issuance of public bonds, which is unavoidable. Research and deliberation on this aspect must also be considered necessary, etc. (Jiji News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cabinet deliberation meeting believes that the national defense budget is inappropriate given the current financial situation. It is likely that the Minister of the Army will be asked to explain future views. The Army believes that explaining the national defense budget involves many military secrets. It cannot be explained in detail outside of the State Ministers' meeting. Even if explained, the calculation plan of the national defense budget is decided by the supreme command, and its nature changes with changes in the international situation. Therefore, given the current state of change in international relations, it is necessary to be cautious in predicting future national defense expenditures, or it is impossible. Therefore, Minister of the Army Hayashi will request the understanding of the deliberation meeting at an appropriate opportunity. (Dentsu News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>Boston News, the Boston Evening Transcript commented on the situation in North China, saying that if Japan's military actions in North China are as reported, then the Chinese authorities must decide their attitude sooner or later. As for Japan's demand to end the anti-Japanese movement throughout China, this demand will never be satisfied. If Japan insists on not letting go, then the disputes between China and Japan will never end. It is also said that the actions of the Japanese military leaders are based on the firm belief that the great powers will never provide armed assistance to China, at most only empty protests, as with the attitude towards Manchuria. Perhaps the observation of the Japanese military leaders is not wrong, but they should also pay attention to an ancient proverb: the best swimmers often die by drowning. (World News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese financial groups plan to actively enter North China after the North China issue is completely resolved. The purpose is to mine various minerals and cultivate cotton. However, most financial groups are still considering political relations and are hesitant to invest. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to discuss with the Ministry of the Army to establish a new company jointly run by the government and merchants. The purpose of this company is the same as the British East India Company in India. It has the nature of implementing national policies and can attract small capital to invest actively.

<p>(Tokyo) As a result of this inspection of the actual situation in "Manchukuo", Minister of the Army Hayashi will advise the government that the most urgent task is to implement an immigration policy towards "Manchukuo," with a view to promoting the current plan to establish an immigration national policy agreed upon by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Kwantung Army. The details of Minister of the Army Hayashi's recommendations are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Regarding agricultural immigration to Manchuria, there are various discussions in the world. However, there is plenty of arable land in Manchuria. If developed in an appropriate manner, I believe that there is absolutely no need to be pessimistic. As for the method of immigration, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Kwantung Army are currently formulating a concrete plan. Generally, a large immigration company will be established in "Manchukuo," and an organization to receive immigrants will be established in Japan. The above situation is the gist of the plan. This matter still requires considerable funds, because this immigration is not only from Japan, but also hopes to move millions from Korea. (Jiji News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to adopt an active policy toward the Dutch East Indies based on a new company jointly organized by the four major shipping companies on the Java route. The final measures, such as supporting the Commerce Act and limiting Japanese ships to transport goods, must be implemented. On the one hand, it will still propose to reopen maritime consultations.

Among them, the issue of currency stability is the most important. Discussions will be based on the report submitted by Professor Gregory of the London School of Economics in the UK. According to Mr. Gregory's opinion, the revitalization of the world economy should take the stabilization of international exchange rates as the main condition, and the satisfactory ratio of each country's currency is not a prerequisite for stabilizing the exchange market, but a part of the entire process of stabilizing currency. This theory has been approved by the International Chamber of Commerce's annual report. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e77">After the Hebei Provincial Government Moved to Baoding: The Work Situation of Each Department; The Finance Department's Rooms are Cramped, Mostly Working in Sheds; the Joint Entrance Examination is Suspended, the Education Department Moves to Baoding Ahead of Schedule; the Public Security Bureau is Expanding its Organization and is Currently Making Preparations <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Government moved to Baoding. The Executive Yuan issued a clear order as early as November of last year. The reason for the delay in moving was that Tianjin was the gateway to North China, and it was feared that a sudden move would affect the public security of Tianjin and Hebei. Moreover, the governor's office and imperial palace in Baoding were mostly old and dilapidated. It was originally planned to renovate them properly before moving, so as to have all departments work together and achieve this goal at the same time. The provincial government authorities were actively preparing to start moving to Baoding on July 1st, but suddenly received an order to move to Baoding ahead of schedule on June 1st. Chairman Yu Xuezhong then summoned the heads of all departments to discuss the relocation plan, and used the telephone to order all departments to complete their closing work immediately and await orders to move. At the same time, Li Pingqing, the head of the first section of the provincial government, was dispatched to negotiate with the Beining Railway Bureau for vehicles for use. The Beining Railway Bureau then provided two special trains, and the provincial government and various departments moved to Baoding on June 1st. By the 4th, Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong, Provincial Government Secretary-General Wei Jian, Civil Affairs Department Head Zhang Houwan, Finance Department Head Lu Muting, and Construction Department Head Hu Yuanhui had all arrived in Baoding from Tianjin. On the 5th, Education Department Head Zheng Daoru also rushed from Tianjin. By the 7th, the personnel, documents, and miscellaneous items of all departments of the provincial government had completely arrived. The transportation train used was sent back to the Railway Bureau by the provincial government, and reports were submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Military Council that the transportation had been completed. On the same day, Yu Xuezhong was relieved of his post by order, and Zhang Houwan, member of the Provincial Committee and head of the Civil Affairs Department, concurrently served as Chairman of the Provincial Government. That day, Yu and Zhang met once, and then at 9:00 AM on the 8th, the handover procedure was held in the auditorium of the Provincial Government. At 3:00 PM, Yu left Baoding for Peiping. The closing matters of the Provincial Government were completely entrusted to Secretary-General Wei Jian for overall management. Zhang, who concurrently serves as Chairman, formally went to the office to inspect on the 9th. As for the internal affairs of the Provincial Government and various departments, they have also been largely arranged. The current situation and recent work of the Provincial Government and various departments after moving to Baoding are investigated as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial Government</p>
<p>The provincial government is located in the old military governor's office (i.e., Baoding Xingying). The buildings are still adequate. Before the provincial government moved here, they were painted once, so the appearance is still neat. The various sections of the province are located in the inner courtyard. The outer courtyard is for the auditorium, the public relations section, the telecommunications section, the receiving and dispatch office, and the reception room. The chairman and the secretariat are located in the main hall of the inner courtyard. In terms of work, except for the telecommunications section and the secretariat, which have not been interrupted, the other sections have all started. After the newly appointed concurrent Chairman Zhang Houwan took office, the internal staff was slightly changed. Liu Qian and Jiang Xizeng were added as secretaries of the provincial government. Tong Shuzeng, the original director of the seal, was transferred to clerk. Zhao Geukui was appointed to fill the vacancy. Han Chuanwei, the original director of accounting, was transferred to clerk. Yuan Xihuan was appointed to fill the vacancy. After Yu Xuezhong relinquished the chairmanship, all members of the Provincial Committee and heads of various departments, led by Zhang Houwan, sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Chairman Huang, and Chairman He, expressing their resignation. President Wang and Chairman Huang replied with telegrams of consolation. Wang's reply said, "The situation is difficult and dangerous, and depends on perseverance to support it. We hope to work together to save the situation. You have long been known for your great achievements. We hope you will work hard and continue to promote government affairs, so as to appease the people. We deeply hope you will work hard." Huang's reply said, "At this difficult and dangerous time, it is gratifying to have your joint efforts to preside over, so as to stabilize people's hearts and maintain the critical situation. I hope you will restrain your desire to resign and work hard to support it, and overcome this difficult situation. This is what I earnestly pray for." Now that the heads of the various departments have been retained by Wang and Huang, they have all dispelled their intention to resign. However, Wei Jian, member of the Provincial Committee and Secretary-General, has decided to resign. Although it has not been approved, Wei left Baoding for Tianjin to rest after the handover of the provincial government was completed, and there is no return date.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Department</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department is located in the east courtyard of the Governor's Office. The rooms there were formerly the army prison, so everything is not up to standard. They have been renovated, and the houses occupied by various sections have also been remodeled and arranged, so that all work has been delayed until the last two days before it started. According to Zhang Houwan, head of the Civil Affairs Department, it took a lot of time to arrange the internal layout after the department moved from Tianjin to Baoding, and it is now largely settled. However, there is still no place to store the existing files. I originally planned to go to various counties for inspection after the provincial government moved to Baoding, so as to investigate the situation of the people. But now that I am concurrently responsible for the duties of the provincial government, the original plan was abandoned. The Civil Affairs Department has decided to thoroughly ban drugs, exterminate the remaining bandits, implement autonomy in various counties, and establish warehouses in the future. At the same time, this year, many counties have reported drought, and there is an urgent need for relief. However, the drought area is too large, and the provincial government is too tight on funds, so the drought relief funds have not been settled. This is one of the things I have been most hesitant about recently. As for the internal work of this department, it has been proceeding as usual, etc.</p>
<p>Finance Department</p>
<p>The work of the Finance Department is extremely complicated, and the number of staff is also more than other departments. Therefore, it was originally planned that the department would be located inside the Guangyuan, because the Guangyuan's rooms were spacious and more suitable. However, the Guangyuan was originally occupied by the headquarters of the 17th Army. There was no definite date for the army to leave Baoding. The headquarters only yielded a part of the backyard. The Finance Department temporarily used the backyard as the department site. Department Head Lu Muting repeatedly negotiated with the provincial government, because the place was not enough for office use, but there was no result. And the work of the department cannot be interrupted for a day, so sheds were set up in the yard, and all secondary work of the various sections were handled under the sheds. Recently, it was heard that the 17th Electric Headquarters was moved to Zhengzhou, and all sections will be able to move into the office indoors. The department recently issued a notice to various counties to quickly establish treasuries, so that the finances of various counties can be turned around. In terms of the Statistics Section, they are rushing to produce the annual report on regular income and expenditure for the 23rd year. Department Head Lu Muting recently went to Peiping from Baoding to handle important official business. Also, the Hebei Provincial Bank has decided to remain in Tianjin, so as to facilitate financial turnover. A branch will be temporarily set up in Baoding, the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Construction Department</p>
<p>The Construction Department is located in the west courtyard of the provincial government and a part of the backyard. The department was the first to move to Baoding, so all files and equipment were transported early. Ten days ago, the internal layout of the department was completely completed and work has begun. According to Yu Fucen, Secretary-General of the department, after the provincial government moved to Baoding, the Pingbao and Jinbao highways are important transportation routes. At the beginning of the relocation of the department, it issued a notice to the counties along the route to be responsible for repairing the roads and set a deadline for completion. The repairs have now been completed and driving is quite convenient. After the completion of the spring work on various rivers, the department has sent personnel to inspect and accept them. As for the provincial telephone network, it is currently being actively planned. In the future, it is planned to first improve the Tianjin-Baoding telephone line. Also, after the provincial government moved to Baoding, Baoding has become the area of the provincial capital, and it seems that the city appearance and the architecture of the provincial capital should be decorated. The department is currently planning to send personnel to investigate first, and then start construction. The city wall should be repaired urgently to make it magnificent. However, this project requires a lot of money, and it is not yet possible to predict whether the provincial treasury has this surplus capacity.</p>
<p>Education Department</p>
<p>The Education Department originally decided to postpone moving to Baoding in order to handle the provincial joint entrance examination. Therefore, at that time, only the Secretariat, the First Section, and a part of the Second Section moved from Tianjin. The Third and Fourth Sections remained in Tianjin to handle the joint entrance examination. Now that the provincial joint entrance examination has been ordered to be suspended, the part of the Education Department that remained in Tianjin has also decided to move to Baoding ahead of schedule, and is currently actively preparing. However, the Education Department's rooms are also extremely small. The old site of the imperial palace has been vacated by the 51st Army, and a part of the Education Department plans to be set up there. Zhang Yucang, Secretary-General of the department, came to Baoding from Tianjin yesterday to preside over everything. Department Head Zheng Daoru will also return to Baoding today (the 17th). According to Liang Zimei, Secretary of the department, the various sections of the department remaining in Tianjin will all move to Baoding within a few days, and plan to borrow the rooms of the imperial palace. At present, in addition to handling the suspension of the joint entrance examination and closing other affairs, they are also rushing to produce the budget for education expenses for the 24th year. The content of the budget has decided to slightly increase the funding for vocational education and social education, and the rest remains the same. The private schools in Baoding are quite advanced, and the Education Department plans to reward them all, so as to promote their improvement. The rumor that the Education Department is banning the private primary schools that are not well run and taking back the houses they occupy is not true.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Baoding Public Security Bureau was originally a special public security bureau. Now that the provincial government has moved to Baoding, it should be changed to the provincial capital public security bureau at the same time. It has now been approved by the provincial government's routine meeting, and it has been decided to change the Baoding Special Public Security Bureau to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. The director will still be succeeded by the original director Miao Zuoxin. After receiving the order, the bureau is currently preparing to expand its organizational methods. Moreover, the public security of the provincial capital is extremely important in the future. The current number of police is not enough, and it must be increased. However, it has not been heard whether the provincial treasury will increase the budget of the Public Security Bureau. According to Miao Zuoxin, director of the bureau, the reorganization of the Baoding Public Security Bureau has been approved by the provincial government meeting. Moreover, now that Baoding has become the capital of the province, the local public security is naturally more important than in the past. I am currently trying to improve the police administration, but the economic limitations make the progress twice as difficult. The reorganization of this bureau is being carried out, and the number of police officers must be increased in the future, and the police salaries will also be slightly increased. Currently, the city defense is the responsibility of the Second Division. The division has been ordered to open to the south. Therefore, after the division leaves Baoding, the city defense and public security will also be taken over by the security team of this bureau. I am currently trying to increase funding, and future improvement matters will depend on the amount of funding increased. (June 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">The River Bank Collapsed in Liuwei - The Area is About Ten or More Zhang <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The river banks belonging to the county, such as the Guazhou and Liuwei areas, are often eroded by the river waves. Guazhou had a city in the past, which was also collapsed into the river by the waves. The center of the river, which is now a mile away from Guazhen, is the site of the former Guazhou city. Since the collapse of the city, no one has made plans to consolidate the river bank. The waves wash away year after year, so the land area of Jiangbei is shrinking day by day, and the Jiangnan area, such as the Xiaomatou wharf on the Bo River, is becoming more and more silted up, making it impossible for ships to pass. Regarding the Liuwei area on the north bank, since the opening of the Zhenyang long-distance bus, the area has become a thoroughfare for crossing the river. In the past ten years, the collapsed river bank has also been more than a mile long. Someone once suggested to the construction authorities of this province that if the south bank is no longer silted and the north bank is no longer collapsed, three stone water weirs must be placed at Twelvewei, Guazhou, and Liuwei to resist the waves. The provincial and county authorities have never discussed this matter because the water weirs are very expensive. Therefore, every time the summer tide rises, the residents by the bank are often in danger of losing their homes. The day before yesterday (the 21st), after 5:00 PM, many cracks were suddenly found on the ground along the Liuwei bank. The nearby residents and the ships by the bank saw this and dismantled their houses and raised their anchors to avoid the danger. Therefore, the Zhenyang Automobile Company was afraid that passengers passing here would be hit, so it notified all stations to stop running the last bus. It is now heard that the collapsed river bank is about ten or more zhang. Fortunately, the pre-order of the cracks was discovered earlier, so no one was injured. It is also heard that the Liuwei bus station has retreated more than twenty zhang. If there is another collapse, the Liuwei and Hongqiao stations will be merged into one. Those who are responsible for building embankments and preserving the land should pay attention to it.</p>

Because his neighbor Wang Xingquan was suffering from a carbuncle and his condition was very dangerous, he asked him to go to treat him quickly. Xu thought that the visitor was sincere and honest, and did not suspect him of being fake, so he drove his own small boat. When he arrived at the bridge, he caught sight of a boat parked there, which looked like a patrol boat. Suddenly, two people jumped onto Xu's boat, handcuffed Xu and the boatman Liu Xizhang onto their boat, and sailed west. After passing Xinchang and arriving at Xiasa, the bandits ordered the boatman to go ashore, and fearing that he would follow, two bandits took him away. After walking near Xinchang Town, they ordered him to return home. The county and government received the report and ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and must solve the case and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

<p>Suzhou has been suffering from a prolonged drought for the past few months, which has almost turned into a disaster. Fortunately, the mold rain has been falling frequently recently. From 5:00 PM on the 22nd to noon on the 23rd, the heavy rain did not stop. The river water rose two feet, and the fields were soaked. Farmers can now start transplanting rice seedlings. The small boats in the four townships resumed their schedules yesterday (the 13th), and the price of rice fell by two corners. However, the collapse of houses was frequently heard in various parts of the city last night. Two houses collapsed at No. 84 Taohuqiao Lane, injuring a young woman named Zhu Wang, who was pregnant and her life was in danger. Also, the walls of the Lequan Bathhouse in Dongzhongshi collapsed completely, causing great losses. Four houses of the Jinshuisheng family on Fengmennei Main Street also collapsed yesterday morning, causing minor losses. However, the locusts in Hengjing and other townships were completely wiped out by the torrential rain.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Wuxi: A Large Number of Locusts Were Found in the Fifth District <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 19th of this month, a large group of locusts suddenly flew in the area of ​​Qianhujia Ferry in Yeqiao Village, District 5 of the county. In the afternoon, another group was mixed in, each time more than a thousand, gathering in the fields north of the village. On the evening of the 21st, another large group was found falling in the courtyards of the villagers in front of the village, and flying into the villagers' homes, dozens in each house. The villagers were extremely panicked when they saw this and captured them one after another. Fortunately, the heavy rain yesterday may slightly reduce the disaster of locusts.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Drought Can Be Avoided Due to the Torrential Rain <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Between spring and summer this year, the weather has been dry and a disaster has been seen. Because it is the time for transplanting rice seedlings in the rural fields, the farmers have been irrigating the fields one after another, causing the amount of water in the river to drop sharply by eight inches on the 19th of this month. Later, due to the drying up of the river water, the farmers could not irrigate and had to suspend transplanting rice seedlings temporarily. People were extremely panicked. Fortunately, there has been light rain from time to time recently. On the evening of the 22nd, there was a torrential rain that did not stop all night, and continued day and night. Until about 12:00 on the 23rd, the heavy rain did not stop slightly, and the estimated rainfall was seven inches. The fields already felt full of rain, and the low-lying fields put the water into the river one after another, so the river water rose sharply by more than one foot. The early disaster can be fortunately avoided, and people are very happy. The price of rice also dropped sharply by three corners. Navigation and transportation have also been restored as usual. According to reliable statistics, there are one million mu of farmland in the city. The cost of pumping water is calculated at five corners per mu, and a total of 500,000 yuan is required. After this rainfall, all of it can be saved. Both high and low farmlands can be transplanted rice seedlings uniformly.</p>

<p>Ling Zhenyuan, an apprentice at the Tongfengtai Rice Shop outside the West Gate of Wu County, is from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and is 19 years old. He usually works hard and is highly regarded by the manager He Lisheng. However, he is very dissatisfied with the life of the rice shop. Recently, because his cousin Jin is the director of the Saltpeter Bureau in Shaanxi, he plans to go there to seek a job, but he has no travel expenses. He took advantage of the unpreparedness of others and stole 2,000 yuan in banknotes from the shop and escaped to Wuxi. He stayed in Room 48 of the Wuxi Hotel. After the shop manager He discovered the theft, he asked friends in Lei, Su, Hu, and Xi to visit. Xu Guoliang, a friend in Wuxi, learned of Ling's whereabouts and reported to the Wuxi Military Police Corps. At about 1:00 AM on the 21st, they went to arrest him and found the banknotes. They were taken to the corps headquarters for temporary detention. Manager He rushed to the news and invited Ling's guarantor to bail him out. He took back the silver yuan, and out of pity for his weak will, he did not want to pursue the matter further.</p>

<p>Another murder case occurred in this city at 8:00 this morning. The fact is that a soldier killed a coach, who was stabbed seven times. The murderer also died under random fire. The reason is that there is a row of business groups in Weijia Wharf, Liantang, here, and Li Yueyi was appointed as the coach and captain. Li is honest and truthful. In April last year, he dismissed Shandong soldier Zhong. Zhong did not leave the town and had been thinking about revenge for a long time. Today (the 22nd) at 8:00 AM, Zhong, carrying a sharp knife, went straight to the group headquarters and stabbed Coach Li twice in the name of borrowing money. Li chased out in pain and fought with him in close quarters, but was stabbed five more times and died. Li was stabbed seven times in total, all of which were fatal. Other soldiers heard the news and rushed to chase him with guns. The murderer fled and was shot by the soldiers with a volley of fire. Zhong also died under random fire. The two corpses are now in the group headquarters, waiting to be reported to the county government for inspection.</p>

<p>Dasheng Third Factory in Changle Town, District 3, experienced a strike on the 7th of this month due to layoffs and wage cuts. The party and government agencies and the factory management have been negotiating solutions repeatedly, but there have been no results. On the 17th, Shi Yuwen, a member of the County Party Committee and director of the Third Factory Trade Union, had a conflict with many employees of the factory due to misunderstandings when he gathered workers for a speech at the old playground of the Third Factory. As a result, the situation became more serious. Yesterday, Liu Xianzhi, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Shi Shuzhi, director of the Haiqi Business Tax Bureau, believed that the labor dispute in the Third Factory would cause more losses to both labor and management if it was delayed for a long time, so they came forward to mediate. The workers put forward four conditions: (1) resume work immediately, (2) wages and working hours should remain the same as in the old example of the 23rd year, (3) release the detained workers, and (4) organize a sound trade union. Liu Shi et al. have negotiated with Shen Yanmou, the manager of the factory, and it is heard that the opinions of labor and management are gradually approaching and there is hope of solving the problem. The conflict between Committee Member Shi and the factory employees has also been mediated by Liu Shi to avoid expansion.</p>

<p>Cai Qixian, the owner of the Cai Yuanmao Candle Shop on Beimen Main Street in this county, is nearly 30 years old. This spring, he met a modern woman named Yu Xiuxuan in an entertainment venue. They saw each other late and made a lifelong alliance. However, Cai was already married, and Yu was also betrothed to the Shen family in Yangmiao Town, and the wedding was scheduled for August. Yesterday, the two secretly went to the vicinity of the Xuejia Stone Bridge outside the South Gate. Xiuxuan asked Cai to cancel the marriage contract and live together. Cai believed that the family was stubborn and it would be difficult to achieve the goal. The two secretly discussed and decided to commit suicide together and become husband and wife in the next life. They each untied their trouser belts and hung them high in the mulberry garden.

Therefore, the situation is still very serious at present.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Zuoting delivered the opening address, saying, "The members' meeting of this Chamber is convened once a year, and this year marks the sixth members' meeting. Looking back on the time since Zuoting and others took office, nearly a year has passed. At this time of national crisis, I feel even more acutely the inadequacy of my talent for the heavy responsibility. At the beginning of my term last year, I encouraged myself by saying that my future efforts should start with commercial education, deeply knowing that the world's economic relations are complex, and every move is insufficient to affect the future of our country. As the ancients said, 'Commercial warfare is like military warfare.' Shanghai is the first line of national defense in commercial warfare, and merchants are the fighters on the front line. If we do not cultivate insightful and capable individuals at this time, there will be no successors, and we will feel even more helpless in the face of the onslaught of global economic tides. Therefore, on the one hand, we have added various specialized and elective courses to the commercial school run by this Chamber to study advanced commercial knowledge, aiming to cultivate capable individuals. Also, when the Nanyang Senior Commercial School experienced unrest, disrupting the studies of many students, the colleagues of this Chamber, considering that the school had a long history and it would be a pity to stop it halfway, were planning to find a way to take it over. The Municipal Education Bureau also entrusted us with this matter, so several members of this Chamber decided to take it over, hoping to fulfill their predetermined tasks and do their best. However, it takes ten years to grow trees and a hundred years to nurture people, and there are no immediate results to be seen. This is what Zuoting and others deeply regret. Furthermore, one of the duties of this Chamber is to promote domestic goods. Last July, the revision of the import tax schedule by the customs had the greatest impact on the textile and paper industries. This Chamber made earnest appeals, hoping to achieve the goal of rescinding the order. However, due to international involvement and various concerns, although the authorities were well aware of the difficulties faced by the business community, the treaty was not changed, so this effort ultimately failed. This is the most regrettable matter in the duties of this Chamber. However, the authorities, deeply aware of the hardships of the merchants, finally abolished the transit tax and reduced or exempted export taxes separately. It is said that the implementation date is next month, which may not be unrelated to this effort. This can be considered a compensatory measure. At the time of the revision of the customs import tax, Guangdong also proposed levying a national goods protection tax on national goods transported from other provinces to Guangdong. The proposed tax rate was nearly 20% of the value, causing great alarm among national goods manufacturers in Shanghai. This Chamber sent telegrams six or seven times, and Executive Committee member Zheng Zenan took advantage of his contact with national grain promotion to go to Guangdong to present the advantages and disadvantages to the authorities. Fortunately, a reversal was achieved. Since the Mukden Incident, the North China market has been almost completely taken over by the enemy, and the sales of national goods depend entirely on Central and South China. Therefore, the Guangdong province's proposal to levy taxes and then suspend them was highly regarded by national goods manufacturers. However, although this measure had significant implications, its scope was limited to national goods manufacturers. The most unfortunate thing was the outflow of silver and the depreciation of real estate, which led to a general economic depression in the city. This Chamber witnessed these difficulties and felt inadequate to address them, discussing them repeatedly and proposing five measures to the authorities to try to overcome the difficulties. However, given the current situation, we cannot say that we have broken through the encirclement. Therefore, Zuoting uses the fourteen words of Zhuge Liang, 'I received the commission at a time of defeat and was ordered to take office during a crisis,' as an encapsulation. From now on, I will only exhaust my wisdom and loyalty, hoping to live up to the trust and do my best. In addition, I would like to add that after last year's efforts to reduce expenditure, the finances of this Chamber are fortunately able to balance income and expenditure, with a small surplus. This is a great comfort to my colleagues."</p>
<p>Representative Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, said in his speech, "In the past year, the decline of industry and commerce and the financial panic in this city have been alarming. Today, as we hold this meeting, we look back at an environment that is worse than before. Therefore, the responsibility we bear today is even greater. The task of today's meeting is to review the past and plan for the future, so that industry and commerce and related businesses can jointly determine a complete and concrete plan to solve the current difficulties. I have two suggestions. Firstly, we feel that the main reasons for the decline of industry and commerce and the financial panic are the dumping of foreign goods and the increase of foreign power. If we want to eliminate these foreign threats and seek the revival of industry and commerce and financial stability, the solution lies in implementing industrial and commercial control. Control not only passively restricts production but also actively develops production. Control has four key points: (1) adopt collectivism; (2) have a spirit of mutual assistance; (3) have a detailed plan; (4) have an organization to manage and supervise prices and production quantities. With the above foundation, resisting the dumping of foreign goods will surely be effective. The Chamber of Commerce, as the leader of industry and commerce, should use this method to seek a way out for industry and commerce itself. In addition, there is another point, which is to be self-reliant and closely related to control. So-called using our own strength to seek the revival of our business, although this is an old saying, we can have a new understanding. Before the 16th and 17th years of the Republic, merchants held the idea of 'business is business' and did not ask about foreign affairs. After the 16th and 17th years, there was a reaction in the thinking of merchants, that is, in addition to the commercial business itself, they wanted to seek a way out in politics, aiming to abolish unequal treaties and overthrow imperialism. They reduced their interest in their own business. As for today, there is a reaction in thinking, realizing that saving the country and the nation still lies in the efforts of merchants themselves. If they only rely on slogans and political power for relief, not only will the difficulties not be resolved but also increase the pain. In this bondage, we can only work hard to seek the revival of industry and commerce, and then the country and nation can be saved." (2) Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, said in his speech, "Chairman and representatives, today we are holding this meeting at a time of serious national crisis. I think that each representative must have a very sad and energetic aspiration. Under normal circumstances, meetings are held to report on past work and plan for future directions. At present, the national crisis is so serious and the environment is so pressing, this meeting of representatives must have a determination and aspiration. In the past year, the economic pain felt by the industrial and commercial circles of this city and the pain suffered by society and the country were most acutely felt by the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai. Today's representatives are all leaders of the business community, and their responsibility is very important for how to find ways to relieve commerce and overcome the current difficulties. Now the general public hopes that the government will actively prepare for construction and stabilize society in political aspects. This is something that the whole country should strive for together. Especially since Shanghai is at the economic center of the country, if Shanghai's economy is shaken, it can affect the national economy. Therefore, whether it is for construction or consumption, it all depends on the economy. Regarding these issues, the government is currently planning to remedy them and proceed separately to save the crisis. However, these difficulties still lie in the industrial and commercial sector's own responsibility to struggle, concentrate resources, and cooperate with government and local personnel, and jointly plan a concrete plan that meets the current needs. The government and the industrial and commercial sector should cooperate and work together, not just rely on emotional impulses, which will affect the overall situation. This is a very important responsibility to the country and the nation. Therefore, I especially hope that everyone will not be passive or fearful, but calmly respond to the war, and only then can there be a way to relieve it. I wish the conference success."</p>
<p>Meeting Affairs Report</p>
<p>Chen Zheqing of the Presidium reported on the meeting affairs, saying, "Since the reorganization of this Chamber in accordance with the law, we have held regular members' representative meetings in accordance with the articles of association, and this is now the sixth. The past meeting affairs situation in this year has been reported by month and item and published in the Commercial Monthly. The representatives should have browsed it. Here, I will only present a few points that are particularly closely related and important to the business situation in the market. (A) Request to correct stamp tax matters. Last October, it was reported that the draft stamp tax law formulated by the Legislative Yuan had been passed by the 73rd Yuan meeting. Within the tax rate table in Chapter 2, Article 16, (1) delivery notes, (2) receipts for money and goods, and (3) bills are all set at one cent for every amount of three yuan or more, up to ten yuan, and then one cent is added for every ten yuan, up to one yuan. Compared with the current regulations on stamp tax, delivery notes are affixed with one cent regardless of the amount, receipts for money are affixed with one cent if the amount is less than ten yuan, and two cents if the amount is more than ten yuan. The bill item did not exist in the current regulations and is now established as a separate item, affixed according to the amount up to one yuan. Common vouchers for merchants, with insignificant powers and rights, and short usage times, adopt a progressive tax law, which is not in line with Article 5 of the principles of the stamp tax law passed by the Central Political Conference, which states that heavy taxation should be applied to vouchers with significant powers or rights or long usage times, and light taxation should be applied to vouchers with minor powers or rights or short usage times. Article 6 states that vouchers for common behaviors should use simple tax amounts, and vouchers for rare behaviors should use easy-to-calculate progressive taxes. Based on the above two points, we immediately telegraphed the Central Political Conference to correct it. At the same time, the Changsha, Beiping, and other municipal chambers of commerce and the timber, hardware, fruit, grocery, miscellaneous grain retail, and other industry associations of this city have successively sent letters requesting efforts to reduce the tax. We have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was forwarded to the National Government, to postpone the promulgation of the law by order before it is amended. Later, the Legislative Yuan Gazette stated that the Central Political Conference handed over the written opinions of this Chamber and various chambers of commerce to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan then automatically amended Article 16 of the stamp tax law's tax rate table at its 82nd regular meeting on November 23 as follows: Delivery notes, receipts for money and goods, and bills, with a cargo price or amount of three yuan or more, are all affixed with one cent; those with ten yuan or more are affixed with two cents; and those with one hundred yuan or more are affixed with three cents, which is much lighter than the passed tax rate. This is the result of this Chamber's efforts to eliminate the progressive tax rate for the three types of delivery notes, etc., in the new stamp tax law. Also, last September, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance announced that old stamp tax stamps should be used by the end of October, and new pagoda brand stamp taxes should be used starting on November 1. Old stamp taxes must not be affixed again, and violations will be punished as under-posting. The various industry associations and foreign chambers of commerce in this city heard of this and opposed it, and asked this Chamber to make efforts to appeal. This Chamber immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance three times, allowing for the exchange of new stamp taxes, in order to smooth out the matter. On November 8, the Ministry of Finance promulgated ten measures for registering old stamp tax stamps, allowing for phased exchanges. This Chamber, in accordance with Article 2 of the measures, organized an old stamp tax stamp registration office on December 1st and presented it to the municipal government, which ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to supervise and start registration. After a one-month limited period, the result was that the number of registered old stamp tax stamps was worth more than 20,000 silver dollars, which were immediately sent together with the original request to the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau for verification and transfer to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and exchange. Although the exchange method has not yet been announced, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the permission of phased exchange, which must be implemented later. This is a rough outline of this Chamber's efforts to exchange old stamp taxes for new stamp taxes. In addition, items such as delivery return slips should not be affixed with stamps, and living account books should only be affixed with one cent on the first page, and the remaining pages should not be affixed. Inspectors of stamp taxes often do not understand the tax regulations and rush inspections, sending them to court for heavy fines, which is extremely detrimental to businesses. When this Chamber repeatedly received the aforementioned complaints from various industry associations or stores, it immediately sent letters to the competent departments, requesting that they be strictly corrected in accordance with the regulations and approved cases. Although the reply approved orders for admonishment, cases of abuse of punishment for not violating the cases still occurred frequently. The volume of cases buried was almost a foot high. This Chamber, in its efforts, ultimately failed to completely eliminate the suffering of merchants, which is something that we must take as a grievance. (B) Request to improve tooth tax matters. The tooth post tax of this city was formerly managed by the Jiangsu Provincial Education Fund Management Office and used as an education fund. In September of last year, it was taken over by the city and new rules of business and goods lists for tooth banks were promulgated. After the various industry associations in the city saw the report, they all said that the rules restricted the extraction of 3% commission, with both buyers and sellers bearing half, and the submission of 2.5-inch photos of business people when applying for a license, and the division of goods into detailed categories, were all detrimental to their own business. They all expressed opposition. Associations such as the Bean and Rice Association, the Charcoal Association, the Chicken and Duck Association, the Timber and Wood Association, the Fresh Fish Association, the Flower Association, the Fresh Pork Association, the Fruit and Grocery Association, the Sorghum Liquor Association, the Seafood Grocery Association, the Tea and Bamboo Shoot Association, the Brick and Ash Association, the Tree Wood Association, the Medicinal Materials Association, the Grocery Association, the Miscellaneous Wood Association, the North Goods Association, and the Fresh Fish Industry Association successively sent letters requesting assistance. After convening the various associations to hold a joint meeting, six points were decided on the spot: (1) The rules of business were set to take effect on October 1, and the time was pressing, so it should be postponed. (2) It is difficult to collect only 3% commission, and it should be handled in accordance with the regulations of each industry. (3) The division of goods into categories should be drafted by each industry based on the actual situation. (4) The record certificate should be proved and received by each association. (5) When collecting taxes, if the tax bill for the previous year is lost, no penalty will be imposed. (6) When applying for a certificate, please do not attach a photo. The above points were forwarded to the Finance Bureau, requesting adoption. The reply was only that the third point allowed each association to submit opinions at any time for consideration, and the fifth point allowed for exemption from tax if the lost tax bill for the previous year was found to be true. The rest were rejected. After forwarding the letter to the various industry associations, they still unanimously insisted on dissent. A second joint meeting of the various associations was convened, and the following was stated on the spot: (1) Most of the tooth commissions in this city are 10%, and the regulations are presented to the Bureau for approval, and customers are happy to follow. (2) Shanghai is a large commercial port, and all expenses such as rent are very large, which is different from the situation in cities and counties. If the commission is limited to 3%, in addition to paying taxes, there will be no way to live, and the tooth industry will have no foothold. (3) At a time when farmers and merchants are struggling, the regulations for tooth banks should be carefully examined in light of the current trading situation and the burden of tooth merchants, and both should be considered. (4) If the sorghum liquor industry, in addition to paying tooth bank registration tax and business tax, must also pay liquor license tax. If the commission is limited to 3%, it will not be possible to maintain all expenses. (5) The third item of the National Financial Conference's resolution on tooth tax reorganization limits the tooth commission, but the paragraph still gives each province and city the power to discretionally determine the restriction based on the trading situation. The local financial authorities in this city should make changes. (6) If the tooth tax reorganization law of the National Financial Conference stipulates that the tooth bank business tax rate is 3% based on the amount of sales, then the limited commission extracted by the tooth bank is appropriate for the tax rate, how can one maintain one's own livelihood? (7) The verification is limited to October 30th, and the time is too short, so please find a way to extend it. A representative was elected on the spot to jointly petition the city government with the representative of this association to amend it. An application was prepared, and this association's Director Runxiang, Director Shaoquan, along with industry representatives Gu Xinyi, Xin Wenyuan, went to the city government on October 24 to request that the rules be amended as appropriate. As a result, they were ordered to draft a summary of each industry's difficulties in implementing the tooth tax rules and forward it to the city government secretariat for compilation and review in order to plan a proper solution. On November 3, based on the request of the various industry associations, they continued to present a letter to the city government, urging that the tooth tax rules be decided as soon as possible based on the summaries sent by each industry, and ordered to be followed. At the same time, please order the Finance Bureau to temporarily postpone the exchange of expiring tooth posts before the tooth tax is reconciled and improved. However, after more than a month, no reply was seen, and the Finance Bureau vigorously implemented new measures, sending the police to urge payment. A presentation was made again, and Pan, the Director of General Affairs, Xusheng, was appointed to urge the government to quickly determine the compromise method for the tooth bank rules, in order to comfort the hope of the merchants. On December 6, the Fruit and Grocery Association, the Bean and Rice Association, and other associations jointly inquired about whether the improvement solution had been drafted, and a presentation was made to the city government, focusing on the restriction of commission extraction, and urged to speed up the approval of each case. On January 31 of this year, the Finance Bureau's No. 5543 official letter was approved, stating that the case was proposed by the Bureau, presented to the city government, and consulted with the Ministry of Finance's No. 11757 consultation, on how to compromise the regulations, which should be carefully discussed and properly regulated by the Municipal Finance Bureau, and then reported to the Ministry for review and implementation. The letter ordered that the industry regulations of each tooth industry association should be collected and sent to the Bureau for reference. However, the requested compromise improvement method was delayed in being announced. On February 22 of this year, based on the request of the various tooth industry associations, a second joint meeting was convened, and four points were decided (mostly the same as those decided at the previous two meetings), and the association forwarded the letter to the Finance Bureau, requesting a quick solution. Until March 7, the Finance Bureau's No. 5674 reply letter was approved, and the handling method was attached. Within the method, for (1) the section requesting exemption from submitting photos when the tooth bank applies for a license, it is allowed to apply as requested; (2) when applying for a license, if it is not possible to estimate the total amount of sales or commission income for the year, the amount of capital may be reported; (3) the section requesting exemption from sending the tooth bank's organization and task briefing when the tooth bank applies for a license is changed to each tooth bank's industry regulations that have been presented to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, and the industry regulations should be sent to the Bureau for record; (4) the Fruit and Grocery Industry, the Bean and Rice Industry, and other associations request to include the certificate application as usual, and it is allowed to handle the donation and exchange of certificates for the tooth industry; (5) each tooth bank requests the association to provide guarantee and collect certificates on behalf of the section, which is allowed if each tooth bank voluntarily requests the industry association to provide guarantee and collect tooth certificates on its behalf, the government will not prevent it, but each association must not force the tooth bank to be collected by the association on behalf, but the main request to draw commissions in accordance with the industry regulations of each tooth industry should be waited until the industry regulations of each industry are collected before reviewing and handling. The main request for a grace period for drawing commissions has not been determined, and it is not the beginning that the municipal authorities have made a mark of accommodating the public opinion of the merchants. (C) Consultation on Relief for Market Panic Matters. Since this city has been affected by the world's economic downturn, the bankruptcy of rural villages in the mainland, the increase in imports, and the outflow of silver, after last year's major settlement, the market has declined to the extreme, and the phenomenon of commercial panic has never been seen before. This Chamber has repeatedly received requests for relief from more than 20 associations such as the silk industry, the electrical silk weaving industry, and the wool industry, and the Federation of Citizens of the First Special Zone, with urgent wording. At the same time, the local association in this city also received the same request, and immediately consulted with the industry, silver, and money associations, and the consultant committee members of this association, to hold a joint meeting. On the one hand, the eighth executive committee meeting of this association resolved to organize a special committee for market relief, and publicly elected Chairman Yu Zuoyan, Standing Committee Member Xu Jiqing, Standing Committee Member Jin Runxiang, Supervisor Du Yuesheng, Supervisor Luo Qinghua, Supervisor Pei Yunqing, and Executive Committee Member Chen Xiaodie as committee members. The local association also organized a special committee to jointly discuss relief methods. In addition to this association, based on the letters from more than 20 associations such as the silk industry and the electrical silk weaving industry, first submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, ordered the Central China Communications Three Banks to fully accept mortgages of real estate and deed certificates, and the practice certificate is the same as the mortgage, and approved the letters to the Three Banks, and ordered them to do their best to accept the situation, and sent telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, and the Ministers of Finance and Industry to quickly plan a fundamental relief plan to save the crisis and stabilize the people's hearts. The special committee has formulated five relief measures: (1) The promissory notes of each industry should be discounted by the silver and money industry. If there is a proper guarantee, the silver and money industry should accept it, and the Central Bank should also give the silver and money industry rediscounting; (2) Deed certificates and land practice certificates should be added as the security reserve under the Central Bank's collection of coupons; (3) Deed certificates and land practice certificates should be added as savings guarantee reserves; (4) Silver and money industry should continue to send regular account books to various stores, but for credit selection items, they may determine their own. As for the store's own organization, it should also strive to be sound; (5) If the silver and money industry wants to mortgage goods or real estate to the Central, China, and Communications Three Banks, or discount notes, they should accept them as much as possible. After submitting the above items to the fifth executive committee for approval, the local association agreed and jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and sent letters to the Central, China, and Communications Three Banks, the Savings Guarantee Reserve Committee, and the Silver and Money Industry Association for investigation and implementation. Except for the second item, the Ministry approved that it was not appropriate to hastily join the deed certificate as a guarantee reserve, and the rest were approved separately. For the fourth item, the credit exchange continues to send account books, and because of environmental restrictions, there is still a need for supplementary measures. The special committee of this association and the local association formulated four outlines of the small loan method for industrial and commercial credit as follows: (1) The applicant for the loan should directly or jointly with the industrial and commercial relief association, open a request for a small loan to the brand capital business situation, the amount of the loan, the name of the guarantor, and send it to the chamber of commerce and the local association for verification and registration, and then forward it to the loan silver group organized by the silver and money industry and the government. After review and approval, the representative bank designated by the group will release the loan; (2) The total amount of the loan is 5 million national currency, and the government and the banks should be responsible for it separately; (3) The amount guaranteed by the government is tentatively set at 2.5 million yuan, and the Chamber of Commerce and the local association will present it to the Ministry of Finance for approval; (4) All procedures for the loan are determined by the Silver Group. The four articles were sent to this association for approval, and a joint letter was sent to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. It was approved that Shanghai's industry and commerce are in need of relief, and the previous request from the association has been approved. As for the small loan for credit, the Ministry of Finance allocated 2.5 million yuan, which has been presented by the banking industry association and the assembled deliberations have been approved. In order to consolidate finance and facilitate the relief of industry and commerce, the Ministry has increased bank capital to strengthen its strength, which has been implemented separately. All loan matters have been ordered to be handled by the banking industry association directly with the Central, China, and Communications Three Banks to draft specific measures and implement the release of loans in accordance with the bank's articles of association for relief. Now it is repeatedly seen in newspapers that the two associations of the silver and money industry have been strictly implementing the measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on loan relief matters for industry and commerce. This is the process of this association consulting on relief for the market situation. (D) Introducing the Commercial Acceptance Draft Matters. The Shanghai Silk Industry Association, in view of the difficulties of the general settlement last year, has tightened its credit release, resulting in tight silver roots and stagnant currency. Most industries feel that the turnover is not working, especially the silk industry. In the past, most of the loan transactions with customers relied on the turnover of the silver and money industry, and it has been a long time since then. If it is purely cash transaction now, it is feared that the accumulation has been deep and it is not easy to implement it uniformly. If the account is still released, then the source cannot be used, how can it flow. The executive committee discussed that in order to plan for both buyers and sellers, there is only the implementation of acceptance drafts. About the same legal advisor, and accountants have repeatedly discussed, thinking that it is in line with the Negotiable Instruments Law, submitted to the members' meeting for approval, scheduled for implementation, and sent letters to the various industry associations, uniformly adopted, and sent letters to the silver and money industry, to discount the previous bill as much as possible, and especially hope to send a special letter to the Central Bank to handle rediscounting. This association should immediately notify the industry associations of this item of acceptance drafts, which is to reduce the release period and increase the use of currency, and at the same time, send letters to the Central Bank and the Silver and Money Industry Associations, agreeing to accept the discount, so that the bill can be active in the market. Subsequently, the Central Bank replied, allowing the handling of rediscounting, but it must first negotiate the discounting method with the silver and money industry, and then the silver and money industry will study the rediscounting method with this bank. After sending the letters to the two associations of the silver and money industry to collect the words, the banking industry association replied with six discounting methods, and the silver industry association replied with the discounting methods. The methods were recorded and forwarded to the Central Bank, requesting the merchants to discuss the rediscounting methods with the silver and money industries as soon as possible, so that the commercial acceptance drafts can be circulated. This association also believed that the acceptance drafts are an innovation, and deeply considered that the business community may not be able to fully understand it. Therefore, in the 3rd issue of Volume 15 of the Commercial Monthly, there is a special issue on commercial acceptance drafts, and a lecture meeting is organized. Supervisor Luo Qinghua is appointed as the director, and experts in law, economy, and accounting are hired to lecture on the topic in stages. All the lectures and speeches of each lecture master are reprinted in the local newspapers in this city, in order to publicize it as much as possible, so that the draft can be promoted and beneficial. This is the outline of this association's promotion of commercial acceptance drafts. The above four points are the more important meeting affairs within this year, and a special report is made as above. In addition, the South City established a branch office, and Director Ma Yuliang was the director. The Yin Bank area of Jiangwan was approved to add a resident cadre, just to facilitate commercial contact in the two places in accordance with the law. If the commercial night</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>School adds morning classes, specializing in teaching students who are free from business with the necessary knowledge of Chinese to avoid illiteracy. The Nanyang Commercial Senior Middle School was suspended due to some reason, and the committee members of this association and the school board of directors decided to take over the school, and the old site of the former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce on Zhonghua Road in the South City was used to recruit the original old students and start teaching again, and Director Zhu Wenqi of the Commodity Column was appointed as the principal. Education is the foundation of the country, and running a senior commercial school to improve merchants' knowledge was originally the intention of the association, and it is dared to be attached to it. All of this is recorded in a messy way, and I hope you will appreciate it.</p>
<p>Commercial Statistics</p>
<p>Next, Ma Shaoquan, Director of the Commerce Section, reported on the commercial statistics situation, saying, "The statistical undertakings of various countries have always been valued, and commercial statistics are particularly important. Only with statistics can we summarize things, make concise comparisons, and predict the growth and decline in the future. Chinese people have always been indifferent to investigation and statistics, especially those engaged in industry and commerce. This association, in view of this, has repeatedly resolved to hold commercial statistics. Initially, due to the limitation of funds, it was not possible to hold it. Later, the Commerce Section of the previous session formulated a concrete method within the scope of funds, and submitted it to the Executive Committee for approval. As a result, the undertakings that this association had expected for several years were realized. The leaders of various industries were then hired to organize a business committee to manage it. The last session decided to designate industries such as banking, money exchange, trust, cotton cloth, sugar, paper, coal, rice, silk, and yarn as the first phase. In addition to the financial industry (including banking, money exchange, and trust) and the cotton cloth industry, which have been completely completed in the last session and compiled into commercial statistics series, the remaining industries have been investigated many times, but the effectiveness is very low. However, this association, in view of the importance of this work, seems that it cannot be difficult to retreat for a long time. This session has rehired leaders from various industries, Guo Shun, Wang Zhixin, Luo Qinghua, Ma Shaoquan, Ke Ganchen, Li Wenjie, Zhu Wenqi, Chen Ziyi, Xu Xiaochu, Zhang Peizhen, Shen Zizha, Chen Ziming, Tu Kaizheng, Cheng Yujie, Zhang Niandong, Ye Jiaxing, Wang Jinshi, Ge Jiechen, Yang Yongnian, and other 19 people, as members of the Business Committee, to assist in everything. And Sun Mingqi, Jiang Jianxin, Dong Wenzhong, He Tai, and others from the Business Section are specially responsible for it. The first meeting of the association resolved: (1) to complete the various industries designated in the previous session that have not been completed within the time limit; (2) to designate the color printing industry, the new medicine industry, and the Chinese and foreign grocery industry to start statistics</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wen Lanting delivered the opening speech, saying: "Today is the first general meeting of sponsors from all walks of life in Shanghai for the construction of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Why are we initiating this meeting? Because Chiang Kai-shek has been striving for revolution and fighting for the nation for over twenty years, his contributions to the party and the nation are undeniable. For the sake of honoring virtue and rewarding merit, and for the sake of learning from the past and encouraging the future, we express our utmost admiration for the revolutionary leader who has benefited the party and the nation, and we seek to commemorate him. Therefore, we have united over a hundred public organizations and comrades from all walks of life in this city, with the most sincere attitude, to initiate the construction of a memorial hall, aiming to establish a valuable monument in Shanghai, the largest metropolis in East Asia, for Chiang Kai-shek, who has worked hard and made great contributions. On one hand, it is to encourage Chiang Kai-shek to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and continue to work hard, using the spirit of revolution to break the current adverse environment and find a new path for the Chinese nation. On the other hand, it is to call on the majority of our people to show their clear support and trust in the revolutionary leader, and to be his strong backing. This is the greatest significance of the initiation of the construction of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall by all sectors of the city from the standpoint of the people. The mission of today's meeting is extremely important and significant. Its main task is to organize a preparatory committee to be responsible for the design and supervision of future progress. We hope that all attendees will carefully select candidates and appoint people with good reputation and public spirit to serve as committee members and share the responsibility, establishing a sound and orderly organization to fulfill this important mission. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve development without the collective efforts of all. We hope that the party and government organizations will fulfill their responsibility of leading the people, fully advocate and correct any shortcomings. We also hope that all sectors will unanimously support and facilitate this effort, so that colleagues can complete this undertaking in the shortest possible time under the leadership and supervision of party and government organizations and all sectors. This is what we earnestly hope for."</p>

All sectors of the city held a public memorial service at the China Funeral Home at 4:00 PM yesterday and escorted the remains. The funeral procession was solemn and grand. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Funeral Hall</p>
<p>Shi's funeral hall was set up in the main hall of the China Funeral Home on Haig Road. The hall was decorated with plain colors, and Shi's coffin was placed in the center, covered with the party emblem and a plain embroidery banner. A memorial table was placed in front, with Shi's portrait and spirit tablet on it, surrounded by flowers and offerings of fruits. Wreaths from all sides were hung around the hall, including those from Mayor Wu, Kong Xiangxi, Du Yuesheng, and the Panchen Lama Mongolian and Tibetan Academy. Shi's wife, five sons, and three daughters attended to the service in mourning attire. The arrangement was quite solemn and dignified.</p>
<p>Details of the Public Memorial Service</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4:00 PM, all sectors of the city and Shi's relatives and friends gathered at the China Funeral Home on Haig Road to jointly hold a public memorial service. The National Government specially appointed Wu Tiecheng as the representative to offer condolences, with Guo Yulong as the master of ceremonies. The order of the public memorial service was as follows: (1) All stand in solemn silence and perform the public memorial ceremony; (2) The chief mourner and participants take their positions; (3) Play mourning music (Municipal Police Band); (4) Pay the highest respect to Mr. Shi Qingyang's portrait; (5) Present flowers (Chief mourner Wu Tiecheng); (6) Silence; (7) Read the eulogy (Qiu Zhushuang); (8) The family members express their gratitude; (9) Play mourning music; (10) Ceremony completed. The ceremony was very grand.</p>
<p>Reading the Eulogy</p>
<p>On the twenty-third day of the sixth month of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, representative of the National Government, and representatives from all sectors of Shanghai, respectfully offer pure wine and humble offerings to the spirit of Mr. Shi Qingyang, saying: "Alas, revolution is difficult and full of hardship, as it has always been. Our party has worked hard, but the merits do not compensate for the troubles. The scholars ask for the country, and the people worry about the nation. Your excellence has already returned to your quiet home. Your life is known to the world, but your premature death is a cause for sorrow. Since your youth, you abandoned Confucianism and took up the pen, rallying the masses and raising troops to kill the rebels. You personally led the party, following the wind of Sichuan. You fought against injustice on four fronts, showing both courage and loyalty. The Yangtze River was pacified, and the central government appointed you to administer the border region, hoping to promote your prestige and virtue. However, the border was not yet settled, and grandiose strategies were set in vain. Who will implement them? It was not your intention to hold office and live a life of ease. Your long illness and death leave your spirit in sorrow. How admirable it is that you have died a heroic death, and your friends and colleagues have come to mourn you. Alas, rest in peace."</p>
<p>Funeral Procession</p>
<p>After the public memorial service, the remains were moved to the hearse at 5:00 PM. The procession started from the China Funeral Home on Haig Road, led by the Municipal Police Band, followed by a car carrying flowers and Shi's portrait, the hearse, family mourning cars, and over forty cars carrying representatives from all sectors of society. Those who participated in the funeral procession included Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Zhu Xuefan, Mei Shuzeng, Tang Jinbai, Jiang Huaishu, Li Dachao, Xingkong, Mantuo, and representatives and friends of Shi's.</p>
<p>Remains Transported to Nanjing</p>
<p>A temporary mourning hall was set up in front of the Songhu branch line platform on the east side of the North Railway Station, with a tall plain-colored archway at the entrance and a white cloth banner that reads, "Mr. Shi Qingyang's Remains to be Buried Publicly." The special train was decorated with plain colors and interspersed with blue and white colored balls. The station was guarded by the 9th Security Company. At 5:25 PM, Shi's remains arrived at the North Railway Station and were moved to the train. After all participants in the funeral procession paid their respects in front of the station, Shi's wife and sons Xiaopu, Xiaoxian, Xiaozhu, Xiaosheng, Xiaoyin, and daughters Xiaoying, Xiaoru, and Xiaorong boarded the attached passenger car. The train departed at 11:00 PM, carrying the remains to Nanjing, where a public burial will be held at the First Park Martyrs' Shrine in the capital on the 28th.</p>
<p>National Government Commendation Order</p>
<p>The National Government, in recognition of Shi's past contributions to the party and the nation, issued a commendation order yesterday, stating: "Shi Qingyang, former Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was loyal and upright, with outstanding talent and knowledge. In his early years, he embraced the Three Principles of the People and joined the revolution, leading the Sichuan army in repeated uprisings. He struggled arduously and remained steadfast throughout. In recent years, he has managed the border region, assisted the central government, and long-term planning was highly valued. Due to his old illness not being cured, he was temporarily allowed to resign to recuperate in peace. We are deeply saddened by his sudden passing. Shi Qingyang is to be granted a funeral allowance of five thousand yuan. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai is to be sent to represent the National Government to offer condolences, and the Ministry of Personnel is to be instructed through the Examination Yuan to deliberate on preferential pension treatment. His life's achievements are to be recorded and sent to the Historical Archives to show the nation's deep remembrance of his loyalty and meritorious service. This is the order."</p>

<h3 id="e106">Manager and Shareholders Sued After the Collapse of Dingshen Bank; Jointly Liable for Compensation; Dispute Arises Over Summons Issues <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Dingshen Yuanji Bank, located in Ruyi Lane on Henan Road, announced its closure on October 18 due to financial difficulties and appointed lawyer Zhang Ji as its liquidator. Forty-seven creditors, including the Science Instrument Museum, have petitioned the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to liquidate the bank, as they have not heard of any plans for the bank to repay its debts. With the approval of the Ministry, they have engaged lawyers Chen Tingrui, Ping Heng, and Zhou Yuwen to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court against the bank's managers and shareholders Yang Songnian, Qi Weiquan, [Blank] Yunbiao, Mu Zhiqing, Qi Shuifang, and Hong Ruihou, demanding repayment of their deposits totaling 81,568.86 yuan, along with statutory and agreed interest from May 1 to the date of enforcement. The basis for the lawsuit is Article 681 of the Civil Code, which states that "If the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the debts of the partnership, each partner shall be responsible for the deficiency." As the bank's assets are insufficient to pay off its debts, the defendants should be jointly responsible for compensation. Instead of attempting to find a solution, they have continuously published advertisements, hoping to stall and delay, thereby harming the creditors' rights. Therefore, they have filed the lawsuit. The trial was opened in the Fourth Civil Court by Judge Mo Runhua the other day. The summonses for the defendants were delivered to the liquidator Zhang, who only accepted the summons for Yang Songnian and returned the rest. Plaintiff's lawyer Chen argued that since lawyer Zhang is the liquidator of the bank, he should receive all the summonses and should not refuse to do so. The dispute over this issue lasted for quite some time. Finally, after court discussion, the judge instructed the lawyer to provide the plaintiffs with the addresses of the defendants in writing. The plaintiffs will then submit a request to the court for the reissuance of summonses to be delivered directly. The case was then adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a Russian named Singer, who runs a leather business at 128 Yuanmingyuan Road, was found tied to a chair in his shop eight days ago. At the time, he claimed to have been tied up by "two Chinese" and robbed of 1,260 yuan in cash. After inspection, the detectives of the General Inspectorate of the Concession Police found the situation suspicious and continued their investigation. They discovered that Singer had indeed made a false report and found conclusive evidence. Therefore, Singer was detained yesterday morning (the 22nd) and is scheduled to be sent to the First Special District Court for trial on Monday. It is rumored that there will be shocking revelations at that time. After Singer was untied, he pretended to be feeble. Initially, it was thought that he was suffering from a nervous shock, so he was sent to the hospital by ambulance. Now it is known that this was also a pretense. Although Singer was cunning, he could not escape the sharp eyes of the detectives.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Suicide Due to Inability to Repay Association Dues; Family Files Lawsuit; Yang Buyou Accused of Murder; Court Must Investigate the Case <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yan Shizhou, a native of Huaicheng living at 4 Gongyi Lane on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, was 46 years old and worked as a rickshaw puller. In the past, he needed money for legitimate business and organized an association with relatives and friends. Yang Buyou, a fellow villager of Yan's, lived at 477 Malong Road (30 years old this year, formerly a French Concession police officer, also participating in two associations). On the 14th of last month, Yan Shizhou owed association members money to Yang Buyou's association. Therefore, all association dues that should have been paid were deducted, leaving Yan unable to cope for a while. After Yang received the winning bid, he only received half of the association dues, leaving a shortage of 56 yuan, which Yan promised to repay. In the end, Yan relied on manual labor for a living and could not arrange the funds in time. On the 24th, Yang went to Yan's house to demand payment, resulting in a conflict because Yan could not pay. After the argument, Yan went out. At [blank] o'clock in the afternoon, he returned home to sleep. At four o'clock, he died. Yan's elder brother found out and reported to the French Concession police, accusing Yang of forcing his brother to death. The police sent the body to the mortuary and informed Yang Buyou, who surrendered to the police. After the police reported to the Second Special District Court, a coroner performed an autopsy and determined that the deceased died of poisoning. The body was claimed by his family. It was reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, police detectives found that Yang Buyou had not used coercion or extortion and had not committed any assault. The deceased committed suicide, so no public prosecution was filed, and Yang was released. The deceased's family was unwilling to accept this outcome, so Yan Ma, the deceased's wife, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Yang Buyou of murder and requesting an investigation to clear the matter, with an attached civil lawsuit seeking compensation for damages. The court, based on the complaint, opened a court session the other day, presided over by Judge Li Changnian. The plaintiff, Yan Ma, and her lawyer arrived at the court and explained the previous events. Witnesses stated that her husband was invited out by Yang and died shortly after returning home, clearly having been forced to death by the defendant. The defendant, Yang Buyou, also appeared in court with his defense lawyer. He admitted to demanding payment and having a conflict, but denied the accusations. After reviewing the evidence, the court deemed it necessary to further investigate the case and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Master and Servant Engage in Lewd Behavior; Complete Denial After Childbirth; Xia Zude Sued in Court <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Xia Zude, a native of Ningbo and an employee of the Salt Revenue Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance, residing at No. 86 Wuding Lane, Wuding Road in West Shanghai, is over thirty years old and has a wife and seven or eight children. During the January 28th Incident, he hired Wang Yuzhen (36 years old), a woman from Changzhou, as a servant. Wang also had a husband who had disappeared due to the war, so she came out to work as a servant. There was a desk in the room where she lived. Xia often went to her room at night to read books and became entangled with Wang. In the [blank] month of the lunar year, they had a relationship. In May, Wang became pregnant. On the [blank]th of [blank]th month, Xia sent her to the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital to give birth to a son, named Yousheng. As it was inconvenient to live in Shanghai, the servant woman took the child back to her hometown and paid five yuan per month to someone to provide breast milk. The child is now three [blank] years old. Recently, Xia suddenly developed a dislike for Wang and refused to let her into the house, denying that Yousheng was his child. Therefore, Wang Yuzhen hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court against Xia Zude, seeking confirmation that Yousheng was his child. The other day in the afternoon, Judge Zhang Qing [blank] of the [blank] Special Court opened the fourth civil court session. Xia Zude did not appear, but lawyer Xi Yaqu came to the court to defend him. Wang Yuzhen first recounted the circumstances of their affair and the birth of the child, stating that Xia Zude personally sent her to the Women and Children's Hospital and signed a document proving it at the hospital. She requested the court to investigate. Next, lawyer Xi defended Xia, saying that the defendant completely denies the plaintiff's allegations. Before the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff used this to blackmail him, intending to force the defendant to pay 10,000 yuan. Therefore, this case is essentially a blackmail attempt. Furthermore, it has been found that the plaintiff has a husband and three children, the eldest being 14 years old, the second 7 years old, and the youngest 4 years old. It is known that the plaintiff has another lover. There was a possibility that she became pregnant during the time she worked at the defendant's house. The allegations do not meet any of the requirements of Articles 1061 to 1067 of the Civil Code and should be dismissed. Judge [blank] reviewed the evidence and stated that the case still requires investigation and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Renji Hospital's May Report; Describes the Severity of the Economic Recession; The Number of Suicides Has Increased Fivefold Compared to Last Year; 4.5 Yuan Can Save a Person's Life, 1.5 Yuan Can Preserve a Family <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The director of Renji Hospital has released the May report, stating that in recent months, many people in Shanghai have heard news of recession and the significant impact on commerce. Bank closures, liquidations, and bad debts all relate to countless individual lives. What appears in newspapers is only a fraction of the reality. Those working in hospitals are more aware of the suffering caused by the recession than the average person. Perhaps the only ones who can match their awareness are the police officers. There have recently been two group suicide cases, which have been publicized due to their dramatic nature. To understand the severity of the recession, one must look at the number of suicides on a daily basis. From January to May of the seventh year [of the Republic, presumably 1918], the number of suicides at Renji Hospital was as follows: January 75, February 68, March 124, April 74, May 122, totaling 463. This year, it is: January 82, February 81, March 126, April 152, May 180, totaling 631. The increase may be entirely due to economic hardship. What is the value of a person's life according to market prices? It is alarming to consider. Let's take an example. A strong man came to Shanghai from the countryside seeking work. Later, he lost his job due to a factory closure and became a peddler. He then became a beggar due to unfavorable circumstances. His last asset was only one [blank], which he used to buy arsenic, took it, and collapsed on the roadside. He was sent to the hospital and saved. After verification, he was given a small amount of money, enabling him to continue as a peddler. After a month, he was able to make a living with a surplus. The money given was only 4.5 yuan, with 3 yuan used to buy a basket and miscellaneous goods, 1 yuan used to buy an old blanket, and 5 jiao for pocket money. This is the price of a person's life. Another woman was troubled by poverty and illness and [blank] opium, because her children were already dead, her husband was unemployed, and there was no way to make a living. Later, the woman was saved in the hospital, and she recovered after a few days of treatment. Her husband also found a job, so they could live. The medical expenses required only 1.5 yuan, which at least temporarily preserved a family. Is it not astonishing? By the end of May this year, the number of outpatients totaled 74,540, an increase of 9,436 over last year. There are many reasons for this, but one is that many patients cannot afford to see private doctors due to economic hardship. The work in the hospital is busier than before, and the number of staff has not only not increased, but has actually decreased due to the impact of the recession. Donations from all sides have decreased significantly compared to before. It is hoped that benevolent gentlemen will pay attention.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, only Lin Kanghou's representative Wang Jian'e arrived first, followed by the lawyers Jin Hualong, Wang Zuxun, and Lin Kecong, who announced the bank's closure, and creditor representatives Xu Yongzuo, Chao Kun, Qiu Hanping, Liu Yan, Yao Xiaoqiu, Li Ming, Chen Zhonggao, and Ren Jinpin. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, chaired by Luo Zongmeng, who reported that he had been appointed by the Ministry to supervise the liquidation of the bank and had convened the board of directors and supervisors to discuss liquidation methods.</p>
<p>Creditor Representatives Decide to Submit Petition to Ministry</p>
<p>As no directors or supervisors attended the meeting, Lin Kanghou's representative Wang Jian'e declared that the meeting could not be held because only one person had arrived, and he immediately withdrew. After consultation, the creditor representatives decided to submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance in the name of the creditor group, requesting the appointment of a commissioner to conduct a prompt liquidation under the supervision of Luo Zongmeng, to avoid further losses to the creditors due to prolonged delays. Luo also agreed to forward the creditor group's petition to the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>During the National Child Welfare Leaders Conference held by the China Child Welfare Association last year, many child experts believed that the management of orphanages in our country was not satisfactory. For example, one wet nurse was taking care of two to four infants, which caused poor development due to insufficient breast milk and extremely high mortality rates. Recognizing this, many experts requested the Child Welfare Association to improve the situation. It is understood that the association considers this matter to be of great importance and is actively planning to improve orphanages nationwide to promote the well-being of children. According to the news, the work of improving orphanages will begin in Shanghai and then extend to other regions.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Hudong District Rent Reduction Committee's Letter to the Real Estate Association <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Please Voluntarily Reduce Rents to Avoid Disputes</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Hudong District Rent Reduction Committee has been working intensively. Representatives from various neighborhoods have been requesting the organization of sub-committees. Reductions have been approved in Huade Road Hongyuan Lane, i.e., AIA Lane, and Huade Road Sida Lane, as well as the landlord of Wuhe Foreign Firm in Zhongxing Lane, etc. Now, in order to foster goodwill between landlords and tenants in the Hudong District, the committee has sent a letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association, requesting that it urge all landlords in the Hudong District to voluntarily reduce rents appropriately to avoid various disputes. The letter states, "Respected Sirs, since the Shanghai Incident, the global economic panic and the social and market depression have affected all countries, but our country has been particularly severely affected. Rural bankruptcies, urban collapses, and production declines have reached their peak. In this state of economic downturn, unemployment is increasing daily, and suicides are frequently heard of. All these are due to this harsh environment, which has led to all sorts of tragedies. Those who hear of it are saddened. Moreover, the cost of living in Shanghai is incomparable to other places. Although food and clothing can be saved, there is no leniency when it comes to housing. Tenants are still subject to the constraints of landlords and suffer unspeakable pain. With no means of livelihood, they cannot afford to think of anything else. Now that property prices have plummeted, rents should also be reduced appropriately. Therefore, landlords throughout the city who have voluntarily reduced rents are not uncommon. Since the establishment of the Hudong District Rent Reduction Committee, our committee has witnessed the difficult times and repeatedly sent letters to the landlords, earnestly requesting them to be considerate of the people and generously grant rent reductions. Although a few landlords have agreed to our repeated requests, the majority have not understood. We believe that since the January 28th Incident, the Hudong District has been described as a place where the people are poor and resources are exhausted, and shops and factories have closed down one after another. Even those who are still operating are barely surviving. In order to revive the market in the Hudong District and maintain the goodwill between landlords and tenants, our committee specially requests your association to inform all landlords in the Hudong District to voluntarily reduce rents appropriately to avoid disputes over non-payment of rent. This is our sincere hope, and we look forward to your reply."</p>

<h3 id="e122">Small Stall Vendors Relocating <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In the area outside Xiaoximen, along Puzhao River and Jumen Road in the Nanshi area, there have been small stall vendors selling various new and used goods for several years. Since July of last year, when the municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau to issue a ban, the stallholders were greatly alarmed, as their livelihoods would be cut off if the ban were implemented. They elected representatives to petition the party and government organs to be mindful of the people's hardships and to find ways to provide relief. The municipal government subsequently issued an order that the stalls in that area obstructed traffic and were unsightly and should be banned. The stallholders were ordered to find vacant land themselves and report it for approval. It is now learned that, after receiving the order, the stallholders gathered to discuss and elected Song Xiaoqing, Zhao Yunlong, Wang Chunfa, Wang Fulong, Peng Yunshan, Zhang Jiewen, and six others to be responsible for finding privately owned vacant land. After months of running around, they finally found a vacant plot of land at the corner of Hongxing Road in Zhabei, which was large enough to set up stalls. The responsible persons then contacted the landowner and reached an agreement. They then submitted a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for record, so that they could earn a living. The approval has been granted. It is heard that the station branch has received instructions from the headquarters to allow the stalls to operate. It is heard that all the stallholders are scheduled to move into the vacant land to operate on the 24th (today). In the future, the stallholders will have designated places and can operate with peace of mind, which is a good phenomenon for society.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Zhou Huaiqing Accused of Trafficking Workers <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been incidents in the city of privately recruiting Chinese laborers to secretly transport them to the tropics for mining. This is called "selling piglets." It is reported that Zhou Huaiqing, 28 years old, from Shangyu, was friends with Zhang Taichang. Zhou falsely claimed to be a foreman in a yarn factory in Changzhou and said that the factory wanted to recruit a few workers, entrusting Zhang to recruit them. It happened that Yin Wu, a friend from Nanjing, had a son named Xiao Jiuzi who had been unemployed for a long time. Having this opportunity, Yin immediately told Zhou, and Zhou agreed to take him to work in the Changzhou factory. Yin was overjoyed and scraped together a few yuan for travel expenses, sending his son with Zhou. Who knew that after Yin's son left for several weeks, there was no news? Yin asked Zhang Taichang, who also claimed not to know the details. Yin then asked someone to inquire by long-distance telephone to the Changzhou yarn factory, which replied that the factory had not recruited any workers. Zhang was only an intermediary. Since they were close friends, Yin went looking for Zhou Huaiqing for an explanation. Zhou came again to ask Zhang to recruit a few more people. Zhang immediately asked Zhou which factory Yin's son was working in. Zhou was evasive, which showed that he was trafficking in piglets. Yin immediately reported to police officer Zhang Xue-zeng, who arrested Zhou Huaiqing and took him to the Laobeimen Police Station for questioning. According to Shen, the police chief, the plaintiff and defendant each held their own views. The case involves accusations of trafficking and has been referred to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association held its 17th office affairs meeting at 6:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 22nd) at the office of the association in the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge to discuss the recruitment of donations and the progress of matters. The attendees were Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Zhang Xiamin, Li Jimin, Bao Lengxue, Zhu Shengyang, Xue Baolun, Lu Zhangyan, Wei Jianxin, Li Wanyao, Song Zheng, Liu Songtao, Gu Shangrui, etc. The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao and recorded by Chen Shuo. The chairman's report briefly stated that since the beginning of the recruitment campaign, the captains, vice-captains, and team members have been working very hard, reporting their achievements, and paying membership fees and donations very enthusiastically. The solicitation of donations from various industries, such as the hotel industry, the fresh meat industry, and the fresh pork selling industry, which were previously carried out, has been very serious. The newly started ones, such as the freight moving automobile industry and the brick and ash transport brick and tile industry, are progressing very smoothly. As for dance halls, according to the business income standard, 5% of the donations have been communicated to various dance halls, which have expressed their approval. The result of the meeting with all the dance halls in the city the day before yesterday was very satisfactory. However, the representatives believed that the situation of dance halls is different from other industries, and it is troublesome to collect donations according to the income standard, and requested a change in the method, changing the ticket price. It was resolved that when dance guests enter the venue, they will buy a ticket priced at one dime, and the office will send personnel to cooperate with the dance halls to select nine representatives, such as Saint Anna, Da Hu, Vienna, and Lafayette, to form a committee to assist in the process. The questionnaire for each dance hall has been specified. It is hoped that the field secretaries will conduct a rapid survey and complete it within three days. A decision will be made ten days later. At the end of the meeting, a number of progress matters regarding the recruitment of donations were discussed until 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>The headquarters continued to receive Team Leader Shen Junsheng of the 79th Team, who paid a membership fee of 51 yuan, Team Leader Cheng Shizheng of the 1st Team, who paid a donation of 50 yuan, Team Leader Pu Shuhong of the 115th Team, who paid a membership fee of 100 yuan, Vice-Team Leader Wang Chuanbi of the 205th Team, who paid a membership fee of 50 yuan. It is heard that all were received with thanks and requested to make further efforts.</p>

For those unregistered households, since the day before yesterday, personnel have been dispatched to cooperate with the township and village chiefs and the local defense forces to urge them to register on a household-by-household basis. The period for urging registration is set for one month. During the urging period, if the owners of land have not registered, or if there are other land relations, they should submit proof documents, state the reasons, and make up for the registration. It is also heard that the bureau has drafted plans to continue the land registration of Zhong'an, Wusan, Sangang, Zhuzhu, and Shaji, five townships, on July 1st. Temporary registration receiving branches will be set up in Maqiao and Zhuanqiao, so that the people can apply nearby. Personnel have been dispatched to prepare everything.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng She, since Li Yunchang, the prison guard and warden of Baoshan County Prison, took office, he has been unusually strict with prisoners within a month. He has also embezzled the prisoners' food. Originally, each prisoner was supposed to receive 20 liang of rice per meal, but Li Yunchang changed it to 18 liang, so that the prisoners could not get enough to eat. They jointly requested the warden to issue the full amount of rice as usual and requested a change of meal workers, but the request was not approved. As a result, the prisoners started a hunger strike on the Dragon Boat Festival. That night, prison guard Li Yunchang, along with the director, took the nine people who first requested to add enough rice to the detention center, put them in heavier shackles, and ordered two meal workers to hold their heads and feet in turn, strip them of their clothes, and whip them with rattan, so that the prisoners were covered in blood, their skin was torn, and they were forced not to hunger strike. The prisoners had no way to resist and were forced to eat again. However, after eating, they still could not fill their stomachs, so the prisoners tried to jointly submit a petition to the Suzhou High Court, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate the situation in the prison and to request the issuance of sufficient rations and improved treatment according to the regulations. After receiving the request, the High Court sent a committee to Baoshan yesterday (the 22nd) to investigate the truth. In the west flower hall of the county government, they opened a court with trial member Li Shouxuan to interrogate and clarify the truth and inspect the wounds. It is heard that the investigation has been completed and everything will be reported back to the High Court.</p>

<p>The World Peace Association recently published a commentary in the American and Canadian Observatory Daily, which first discusses the current state of armaments in various countries and the organization of non-war groups. It also discusses the fact that the organizer of the association, Mr. Duan Zhengyuan, has considerable prestige among Chinese Confucians, no less than the prestige of Japanese Christian Kagawa. The Great Harmony advocated by Duan has no obstacles between countries, nations, classes, and denominations. The conclusion states that if the above-mentioned obstacles exist, the struggle will never end. Whether it is a country in the East or the West, all human beings have the responsibility to eliminate this crisis.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding a news item published on page 11 of the June 19th issue of your newspaper, "Uncle Kills Niece in Gouloujing, West Shanghai" (Note: This news item was adopted from a Chinese XX manuscript). The article begins with an affirmative account of a case that has not yet been definitively adjudicated, which is inappropriate. The information about me is particularly inconsistent with the facts. For example, the news item states, "Suspect Qiang Binru, who is suspected of instigating and participating in the destruction of the corpse, is still under investigation, etc." I did not hear the trial judge make this announcement in court. I do not know what records the reporter relied on. Also, the news item fabricates that Zhu Zhonghua claimed that "Qiang Jiu went abroad for 200 yuan" and "the workers fled," etc., which is recorded in detail, while my denial in court that I went abroad for 200 yuan and that the factory suspended workers leaving the factory is omitted. It is written that "the language is evasive." I do not know what the reporter's intention is. Therefore, I am writing to request your newspaper to correct this and maintain public trust.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Qiang Binru</p>

<p>It is said that in this day and age, one must read a lot, because life is just about deceiving and scaring people. If you don't deceive and scare people, you will definitely be scared [by others]. Reading more [traditional Chinese] books can scare people, and reading more [trendy] foreign books can deceive people.</p>
<p>If you hit someone and they endure it without retaliating, your conscience suffers the most, because they not only don't forgive you, but they also don't allow you to forgive yourself.</p>
<p>When novelists describe great figures, they often only need to describe everything about their servants. If they completely describe the great figures themselves, then they do not understand the method of setting off the moon with clouds and are bound to fail.</p>
<p>The people of the past look to the present, and the people of the present look to the future. Chinese affairs have always been like the swinging of a pendulum.</p>

<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Hu Junjian and Hu Meizhen were siblings.</p>
<p>Hu Junjian was a graduate from a certain university last year. His academic knowledge was quite good, but since his graduation last summer, he hasn't been able to find a job. He sought help from relatives and friends, and sent out numerous self-recommendation letters, but none of them received a satisfactory response. He also took several public examinations in different places and at different times, but to no avail.</p>
<p>He had a girlfriend when he was studying at the university. But after graduation, his former girlfriends gradually drifted apart from him. Now, not only are his girlfriends distant, but even when they meet on the street, few are willing to nod to him. Some even avoid him from afar. He was doubly stimulated by this, so he often muttered to himself in disappointment.</p>
<p>However, his sister, Hu Meizhen, was in a completely opposite position. She graduated from high school. Before she even graduated, two companies, admiring her reputation as a top student, sent people to contact her and hire her as a female employee. A relative of a classmate, who was an assistant manager at a bank, sincerely invited her to be a female secretary. At the same time, love letters flew in like snowflakes. Although they were all different, they were all willing to give her their hearts.</p>
<p>So, Hu Junjian sighed deeply and said, "In this era, men have reached the end of the road."</p>

<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>When a child is scolded and beaten by their mother, after crying loudly, they will become foolishly silent. People suffering from tuberculosis will also often be silent. A person who usually enjoys a beautiful material environment suddenly falls from a high mountain and lives a life of hardship, they will also often be silent. ...</p>
<p>Silence, now let me tell you about a silent person—</p>
<p>Miss Tao Sijin, the protagonist in the Liu Tao case in Hangzhou, wasn't she a young girl who received artistic baptism before? But now, after being imprisoned, what is she like?</p>
<p>That day, I followed a group of people to visit the First Prison. In the women's prison there, Miss Tao Sijin appeared before our eyes in silence.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is Tao Sijin! ..." A low voice rang out from the mouth of one of the group members, and instantly turned into two, three ...</p>
<p>So I also crowded into the crowd and craned my neck to see this Miss Tao, who had been famous for a long time.</p>
<p>Miss Tao was wearing a blue Shilin cloth cotton cheongsam with a border, and underneath, she wore a pair of green, sparkling trousers. The long and slightly narrow trouser legs were directly connected to her cotton shoes. She sat on a short stool, silently bowing her head, bowing her head, (perhaps her heart was beating extremely fast) bowing her head so low that we couldn't see her face. We only saw her hair; we only saw her holding a book in her hand, silently looking at it; we only saw her companions—of course, also female prisoners—silently pacing the room, and occasionally leisurely looking at us. Only Miss Tao always kept her head down, kept her head down, as if she was very attentively looking at that book. She seemed unwilling for us to see her face, she seemed unwilling to chat with us; although we stayed here for a while, we never saw her face! She seemed to have lost her hearing in her ears, she was also just like a clay sculpture or a wooden carving, she wouldn't even move. I suspected that all the pores in her body were silent!</p>
<p>"Silence!—"</p>
<p>A kind of suffocating air made my heart also silent—I and another member of the group stayed particularly behind. All the members of the group had already turned the corner, and we were still walking slowly.</p>
<p>When we reached the corner, we realized that they had already walked out and the women's prison door had been closed. We turned back again, and we looked into Miss Tao's room again: Miss Tao was still so silent, she was still sitting like a wooden carving, as if she was very attentively looking at the book in her hand, looking, looking—</p>
<p>"Silence!—" I walked out of the women's prison door from Huai Lai with such a mood and that member of the group.</p>
<p>Now when I think back, it seems as if Miss Tao is still appearing before my eyes!</p>
<p>Silence——</p>

<p>Zhiqian saw that he looked very embarrassed, so he slowly calmed his expression. He asked, "What did you see that you are dissatisfied with, that you are so filled with anger?" Beihai then told Zhiqian everything he had heard earlier. Zhiqian couldn't help but laugh and said, "You are from Shaanxi, you are used to such things, why are you angry? An old man who is a tile maker in this Little Western Paradise, his nephew is a farmer, very strong. And he can also read. But that old worker told me that his nephew is willing to follow me to be a servant, doesn't need any wages, just wants to have food to eat. A man is willing to be a servant, so what's so strange about a girl being willing to be a concubine? If we talk about the time of the previous drought, this matter is even more unnecessary to mention." Beihai's anger slowly subsided, and he sat down on the chair opposite him, lifelessly drooping his neck and turning his head. He said, "But from my perspective, this matter always feels wrong. A very good girl is being wasted like this, it's a great pity. People like us with hot blood shouldn't see something and not save it." Zhiqian looked at his rash attitude when he entered the room and felt that he really fit the criticism of being young and inexperienced. He laughed and said, "How can we save her? Unless we pay to buy her back. However, my wife and I have a very good relationship," he smiled slightly at this point, and then continued, "Of course, I can't take another concubine." As for you, do you have that much money to make a golden house to keep her beauty." As he said this, he shrugged his shoulders, indicating that this was a joke. Beihai, in his eagerness, casually shouted to save people, but he had never thought about how to save them. (247)</p>

<p>However, we played on the lake until dark, and nothing unexpected happened. The joyful expression on her old face never changed. It was only after the sun went down that the temperature of the air gradually decreased, and a slight cold wind rose on the lake. Therefore, the Empress Dowager hurriedly ordered us to go ashore and immediately return to the palace. At that time, I secretly guessed that perhaps this slight cold wind was the prelude to some mischief that the child of creation was about to play on us; but that night, nothing unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the next morning, everyone couldn't help but be shocked—the Empress Dowager had passed away. Because from early this morning, it was raining heavily in the sky, accompanied by a very strong wind, and the rain was especially heavy. The thick raindrops and the water dripping from the eaves were constantly hitting the yellow tiles of our palaces with a pattering sound, flowing down with a gurgling sound, making a very noisy sound. At the same time, the sound of thunder was suddenly rumbling on the top of Longevity Hill, and lightning was flashing in the haze. — So everyone in the palace was a little scared. My own bedroom was in a corner of Kunming Lake, far away from the Empress Dowager's palace; coincidentally, it wasn't my turn to attend to the Empress Dowager this day, and I saw that the rain was so heavy, so I didn't plan to go there. Unexpectedly, someone hurriedly came to summon me, and at that time I felt that some terrible event might happen within a few tens of minutes. But look at the current scene! Yesterday, this entire Summer Palace wasn't like a fairy mountain island full of exotic flowers? Everywhere was filled with joy and cheerfulness, unparalleled; but today it has suddenly changed into a mass filled with a dead gray color. (347)</p>

<p>— Zhu Chuo</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting hotter. At this time, people who like to travel to mountains and rivers, except for the rich and important people who avoid the summer in famous mountains, ordinary people, because of the hot weather, cannot travel. Therefore, gardens replace mountains and rivers and become places for tourists to relax. The gardens of Suzhou are originally very famous. Because of the changes of the times, some are abandoned, and some are closed. A little bit of vicissitudes have occurred between the past and the present. Now, I will write about the current situation of Suzhou's gardens below, as a guide for people who come to Suzhou for sightseeing.</p>
<p>Park Since the construction of the pond and mountains, and the construction of the Republic of China pavilion in Suzhou Park, it has already slightly possessed the appearance of a mountain and valley. In this summer, it is a good place for tourists in Suzhou to cool off, especially in the thin twilight when the moon rises on the willow tips. On the recreation chairs of the lawn, and outside the small family food shops and tea houses, and several temporary food stores, the cinema and Huayu store were demolished and flattened, and a new meteorological station was built. In the center of the park, the "Suzhou Library" still maintains its solemn appearance, but due to economic constraints, there is a lack of new expansion inside. As for the scenery of the park, the fragrant grass is lush, and the flowers are like brocade, which has a kind of empty scene.</p>
<p>Lingering Garden Lingering Garden on Wufu Road is a famous garden in Suzhou. The vast area and the magnificent architecture occupy the top spot among Suzhou's gardens. The garden has halls such as the Four-Sided Hall, the Camphor Wood Hall, and the Hanjie Mountain Room. Those Taihu stones such as the "Crown Cloud Peak" are even more famous strange stones. Lingering Garden is the property of the Sheng family. It was kept by the government for several years. Since it was returned to the Sheng family a few years ago, it has undergone a major renovation and has now restored its former magnificent appearance.</p>
<p>West Garden West Garden is located east of Lingering Garden and is the release pond of 戎 　 Temple. The pond has a large area, and a pool of clear water has a special kind of clear interest in the ripples of the green waves. In the center of the fish pond, there is a hexagonal pavilion, and the two sides are connected by a winding stone bridge. The shadow of the pavilion is in the water, and the scenery is very lovely. In addition to the release pond, there are also some rockeries embellished in the garden. The large hall is also for tourists to taste tea and rest.</p>
<p>Lion Grove Lion Grove is located in Pan Ou Lane and is the private garden of the You family. However, tourists can enter the garden for exhibition with a business card. The rockeries in the garden are winding and winding, and they do their best to transform the valleys. It is said that they were built by the famous ancient painter Yunlin. Lion Grove is the home of a wealthy merchant, and the halls and flowers have been renovated to be resplendent and rich in wealth.</p>
<p>Yiyuan Yiyuan is the home of the wealthy gentleman Gu, located in the Shangshu Lane of Suo Hulong Street. There are Peony Hall, Ouyao Studio, Nansue Pavilion, etc. The words on the couplets in the garden were written by Gu Wenbin of the Qing Dynasty. They are mostly collected from ancient people's words and sentences, which are exquisite and elegant, and are unique in the gardens of Suzhou.</p>
<p>Humble Administrator's Garden and Huiyin Garden Humble Administrator's Garden is located on Northwest Street and was the Fengzhi Guild Hall in the Qing Dynasty. The wisteria in front of the gate is an antique planted by Mr. Wen Hengshan of the Ming Dynasty. The garden has buildings such as the Lotus Hall and the Early Boat. The water rockery in the Huiyin Garden of Nanxianzi Lane is constructed in a very unique way. Tianxi Garden has been in disrepair for many years, and it has gradually been abandoned. The weeds are not removed, and the halls are dilapidated, which makes people feel a sense of the ruins of famous gardens when visiting.</p>

<h3 id="e152">City Education Association Reading Club Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Tao Baichuan Reported, Executive Huang Gave Certificates</p>
<p>The political class of the vocational youth reading club, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Education Association, has been completed. The closing ceremony was held yesterday morning at the auditorium of Shanli Shangwen Elementary School. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Bai, representatives from the Municipal Education Bureau, Chen Baichuan, Huang Zaoxiong, and Weng Zhilong, supervisors of the Municipal Education Association, Wulong Zhang, and more than 100 students attended. Tao Baichuan chaired the meeting, and Li Guangsheng recorded the minutes. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report First, Chairman Tao Baichuan reported briefly that the Municipal Education Association, in view of the importance of reading, has organized a vocational youth reading club to seek opportunities for further study for vocational youth. We know that under the current social organization, going to school to study requires money, especially receiving higher education, which requires a lot of money. Therefore, many young people cannot go to school due to family circumstances. Therefore, the Municipal Education Association has organized a vocational youth reading club and wants to organize three types of classes: political science, law, and economics. The first phase is political science, and the legal and economic classes will continue to be organized. In the future, perhaps natural science lectures will be organized. This political science class has come to an end. Today, the closing ceremony is held. Looking back on the past three months, everyone has been able to take some time out of their busy schedules to read. This spirit is very admirable. Now, the second phase is decided to organize a law class, which will also focus on problems. Important topics have been proposed and divided into twelve lectures, and lecturers are being hired. The lectures will probably start in July. Everyone is welcome to continue listening to the lectures.</p>
<p>Representative's Speech Then, Mao Yun, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, briefly saying that everyone is seeking knowledge in addition to their occupations, and their spirit is very admirable. Today's closing is only a temporary ending. There is no end to learning. I hope that everyone will continue to make progress and contribute to society with what they have learned. Huang Zaoxiong, the executive director of the Municipal Education Association, gave a speech, briefly saying that he hoped to continue to join the law class for research and participate in the Municipal Education Association as a member to work together. After the student representatives answered, Huang Zaoxiong presented certificates and the meeting ended.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Recent Situation of the Biology Department of Central University <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The domestic academic community has paid considerable attention to biology in recent years. The biology departments of various universities have also developed considerably. The biology department of Central University is especially well-known. The summary report on its recent situation is as follows: (1) The professors are all well-known scholars of the time. Director Sun Zongpeng has extremely rich experience in animal physiology. Ouyang Zhu is a neurology expert. He has now gone to England to participate in the International Neurological Society and read his thesis. Luo Zonglu, who presides over plant physiology, is proficient in the research of plant absorption of mineral salts. Duan Jichuan presides over plant morphology, cells, and genetics, and is especially skilled in cytology. Geng Yili is in charge of plant taxonomy. Mr. Geng specializes in woody plants. The department also cooperates with the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica and the Institute of Biology of the Science Society of China. The following types of research that they are working hard on will either be completed or are still in progress: (Animal Physiology) The chemical composition of liver essence and its relationship with red blood cells; the nutritional value of several chemical components in food, etc. (Plant Physiology) The relationship between plants and nitrogen-containing substances, the development of root tips, etc. (Animal Morphology) The study of the white rat's brain, the study of frog spinal nerves, etc. (Plant Morphology and Cells) The study of the flowers of torreya wood, pomegranate, loquat, etc., simple methods for tissue fixation and staining, cell research of lilyturf and hosta, etc. (Genetics) The metamorphosis of intracellular substances in the sperm cells of geckos, the influence of ultraviolet rays on cotton cells, and genetics, etc. (Classification) The classification of Rubus plants in China, the investigation of parasites, etc. (3) Equipment has been added in the past two years, worth tens of thousands of yuan. The addition of books and magazines is also considerable. Looking at the development of the department in general, it should be second to none among the universities in the south. The atmosphere of research is particularly strong. This is due to the school's recruitment of competent professors, and the promotion and encouragement of the department by President Luo Jialun is even more rare.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Graduation Ceremonies at Various Schools <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Daxia University: Daxia University held its graduation ceremony for the 145 graduates of this year at 9:00 AM yesterday in the university's auditorium. Over a thousand guests, school board members, parents, faculty, staff, and students attended. The ceremony began with President Shi Boqun's opening address, which briefly stated that the university has been striving to revive national education in recent years, so it has established lectures on national salvation, implemented morality and physical education, added various research laboratories, and is constructing middle school buildings, gymnasiums, etc. More than a thousand alumni of the university have already achieved considerable success in social service. He hoped that the graduating students would carry forward the three spirits of struggle, sacrifice, and cooperation fostered by the university, and with firm determination, follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of seeking freedom and equality for China, in order to save the nation. Then, President Sun Zhe-sheng was invited to give a speech, which briefly stated that the students' academic studies had come to an end, but their journey into society was just beginning. Currently, there is a very crucial and difficult problem to solve, which is the problem of finding a way out. However, he believes that to solve this problem, there are three prerequisites: first, one must be self-reliant and not dependent on others; second, one must permanently maintain the spirit of struggle to overcome the environment; and third, one must consider the nation and people, and not only think of one's own interests. Whether China can become rich and strong, and whether the nation can be revived, rests on the youth. President Sun also strongly refuted the error of the saying "graduation means unemployment," because students do not yet have a profession, so how can they be said to be unemployed? If graduates can continue to work hard to study, struggle, and save the nation after graduation, then graduates will never be unemployed. After President Sun's speech, Lu Jihui, Shao Jialin, Tai Shuangqiu, Tang Wenkai, Sun Haoxuan, and Gu Nian respectively introduced the names of the graduates from the colleges of arts, science, education, commerce, law, and the teachers' college, and then President Shi awarded the graduation certificates.

<h3 id="e157">Ministry of Education Order: National Guangdong College of Law and Science <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the National Guangdong College of Law and Science on the 22nd. The order stated: "The ministry has sent personnel to inspect the college. The report stated that 27 out of the 30 faculty members hold concurrent positions, and they are frequently absent. The students' absences and truancies are even more unrestricted. From September 17th to December 20th of last year, the number of student absences reached 137, with 1,633 hours of missed classes and 1,461 hours of truancy. The allocation of funds shows that office expenses exceed equipment expenses, resulting in deficiencies in library equipment. The curriculum is simplified. The Law Department has not established courses in administrative law and international public law, which are required by the regulations of the Judicial Yuan for supervising national university law departments. Teaching focuses on lectures and lecture notes, and there is no guidance for students to conduct independent research. After reviewing the report, it is clear that the college's management is very inappropriate and must be reorganized in accordance with the following instructions and reported for verification: (1) The college's faculty members should reduce the number of concurrent positions as much as possible and strictly implement a full-time system. Hereafter, the number of concurrently holding faculty members should not exceed one-third of the total faculty. The president, department heads, and other important officials must not hold concurrent positions outside the school. Faculty members' leave or absence must also be restricted. (2) Strict regulations should be established to address student absences and truancy, and they must be earnestly implemented. (3) The allocation of funds should ensure that equipment expenses account for at least 25% of the recurring expenses, and office expenses should not exceed 10%, in order to save money and enrich equipment. (4) The college's addition of a political science department was not approved by the Ministry of Education, and the recruitment of students was carried out prematurely, which is inappropriate. The management is also poor and should be terminated immediately. The original students should be instructed to change departments or transfer schools. (5) The Law Department's curriculum should include necessary subjects. Teaching methods should focus on improving students' ability to read reference books in Chinese and Western languages, and cultivating students' spirit of independent research. (6) The college's recruitment of new students should be subject to rigorous examinations to determine admission. Graduates of the college's affiliated high school must not be directly admitted to avoid excessive numbers. Teaching and examinations in the affiliated high school should also be improved."</p>

<p>National Shanghai College of Commerce: The National Shanghai College of Commerce was originally the commerce department of Nanjing Higher Normal School. When Nanjing Higher Normal School was transformed into National Southeast University, it established a branch in Shanghai, known as the Shanghai College of Commerce of National Southeast University. In the autumn of the sixteenth year of the Republic, Southeast University was reorganized into the Fourth Sun Yat-sen University and divided into nine colleges. The name of the Shanghai College of Commerce was abolished and renamed the College of Commerce. Subsequently, Sun Yat-sen University was renamed Jiangsu University and later the current National Central University, and the College of Commerce remained affiliated. It was not until the twenty-second year of the Republic that it was separated from National Central University and became directly affiliated with the Ministry of Education. The school has been established for fourteen years, and it has produced many talented people and achieved remarkable results. The new school buildings being built in Jiangwan will be completed by the end of the month. New student enrollment for the next semester is imminent.

<h3 id="e162">Selection of Swimmers to Attend the World Games <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Based on the results of the previous National Games. The Guangdong and Hong Kong regions will be entrusted to handle the selection. The final decision will be made after the National Games.</p>
<p>The training team for the basketball team participating in the World Games has been selected, including Wang Yuzeng and twelve others. Details have been reported in the previous newspaper. The team will go to Qingdao in July for training.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the spirit of sports and improve the performance of athletes for the World Games to be held in Germany next year, China has organized a summer camp and summer training session at Shandong University in Qingdao to train and select athletes. The National Sports Association originally planned to train for track and field, basketball, and swimming. The selection of track and field and basketball has been largely completed, but swimming has been lagging behind in recent years. Also, most swimming talents are from Hong Kong and Guangdong. The provinces in North China lack suitable environment. The National Sports Association has decided to make a decision on the swimming portion after the closing ceremony of the National Games. The level of swimming in China is far behind that of Western countries. The reasons for this are unsuitable terrain and lack of fundamental training.</p>
<p>In the 22nd National Games, the record holders in swimming for both men and women were from Hong Kong and Guangdong. The championship in the men's division went to Guangdong Province, and the championship in the women's division went to Hong Kong. Based on the above, the swimming portion of this year's World Games will still be held in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Therefore, the swimmers who will represent China at the World Games in Berlin next year will undoubtedly be selected from Hong Kong and Guangdong.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Zhejiang Province National Games Athletes: Men's Basketball and Volleyball Demonstrations <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Volleyball Strength is Very Strong</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Province representatives for the National Games ball sports, the women's team, held selection demonstrations at the Provincial Stadium the day before yesterday. The performances of Hongdao, Hangzhou High, and Yunfeng teams were generally better. (Note: The Yunfeng team was founded by Mr. Ye Suozhong and organized by Mr. Zhang Mengji, and was established during the spring break. It is not a temporary team formed to participate. Furthermore, the members of this team, except for Zhu Jiasun and Shen Dexian, who are students at Hangzhou High School, are all currently serving in various agencies in Hangzhou City. It is a purely civilian sports club and has no connection with Hangzhou High School.) The selection committee will finalize the selections and announce them on a regular basis. The 22nd was designated for the men's basketball and volleyball selection demonstrations. Due to rain, it was moved to the Zhejiang University rain court. The judges still attended to evaluate and conduct a non-scoring exhibition match. The volleyball started at 4:00 PM. Most of the participants were members of the Aviation and Arts Specialist teams, totaling over twenty people. The performance of both teams was strong, so there is infinite hope for participating in this National Games. (Note: In the previous National Games, the Zhejiang representative team had already obtained the right to the quarter-finals, but due to the absence of a few key players, the effort fell short.) Most of the team members in this session are the same as before, and Xu Heng has also joined, making the strength even greater. The basketball demonstration started at 5:30 PM, with participants including the Hangzhou City team and a mixed team of Hangzhou High School and Zhejiang University. Shu Hong, Liu Qisong, and Yang Shannong served as judges. The performance of each team was excellent, and the demonstration ended at 6:30 PM. It is reported that the selection committee will hold a meeting within days to decide on the roster, so that each team member can train early and strive for further improvement.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Dynamics of Sichuan Currency <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zunbai</p>
<p>The complexity and disorder of the Sichuan currency system are probably unparalleled in all provinces of China! The primary cause of this phenomenon is undoubtedly the evolving system of military districts. The military and civil finances of any military district are controlled by the local garrison commander, absolutely free from the jurisdiction and constraints of the central government and the provincial government. Therefore, the power of the Sichuan military commander is no different from that of the chief of a barbarian tribe. Conflicts of interest occur frequently, leading to armed conflicts. In this environment, they must rely on military force as a backing to consolidate their position. However, the strength of military force depends entirely on the economic situation. The consumption of military pay and equipment requires huge sums of money to replenish. Given this situation, they cannot but strive to enrich their own economy: on the one hand, they resort to harsh taxes and levies to seize cash from the people; on the other hand, they buy up high-quality currencies and recast provincial currencies that are not legally defined. All of this is supported by iron-clad facts. This motivation is entirely based on the desire to enrich their own economy. Therefore, in the fragmented Sichuan, almost all military departments have minting agencies, and even division and brigade commanders with strong combat capabilities can freely mint coins. Their purpose of minting is solely to make money. The malpractice of cutting corners is unavoidable, and the fineness of the manufactured currency is absolutely insufficient. In areas within their military reach, they can enforce its use by oppression, but beyond the military district, they feel beyond their reach. Similarly, the currency of Military District A cannot be used in Military District B; the currency of Military District B cannot circulate freely in Military District A. With so many minting agencies and free minting, the currency produced is naturally complex. Moreover, in order to consolidate their economic power, the various military forces absolutely do not allow the currencies of other military forces to enter, fearing that they will occupy their market and disrupt the economic organization, and secretly and invisibly exclude them. Unscrupulous merchants in society take advantage of this opportunity to deliberately create all kinds of disturbances, claiming that certain currencies are not of sufficient quality and refusing to accept them, or requiring discounts for them to be used. As a result, even the same currency has different values in different places. The chaotic and complex currency system poses a great threat to the livelihood of the people, and the rural economy is gradually heading towards bankruptcy. Last winter, the Shanghai exchange rate in Chongqing reached a new record of more than 1,800 yuan, and trade throughout Sichuan almost came to a standstill. This was because the military issued banknotes indiscriminately, there was a shortage of cash, and the value of the currency itself plummeted, forming a complete financial chaos in Sichuan, further demonstrating that the Sichuan social economy was approaching a total collapse.</p>
<p>Now Sichuan is gradually moving towards unification. The previously fragmented political situation is gradually merging, and the hell-like darkness of Sichuan seems to have a glimmer of hope. However, the chaotic currency system, which has most severely damaged the people's livelihood and economy, has not yet been heard of any proposals for improvement. We know that in a place with a chaotic currency system, it is absolutely impossible for its finances to be clear. The transition from divergence to unification in the currency system is a necessary process of social transformation. Therefore, if Sichuan is to become a region of enlightened politics, currency reform is indispensable. However, effective reform must rely on careful planning, and the creation of careful planning must be based on detailed facts, otherwise it will violate reality and there will be no satisfactory results when implemented. Therefore, I have summarized the data I obtained from surveys and interviews last year in a concise description for the reference of currency reform experts in our country, to arouse the interest of the people in research, and to jointly establish a unified currency system for Sichuan. This is the biggest intention of my writing this article.</p>
<p>Let's start with silver coins first.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Sichuan's monetary standard was entirely based on taels. The market circulation included silver ingots of fifty taels, ten taels, and five taels. Only after the Chengdu Mint was established in the 27th year of Guangxu did it mint silver coins with dragon patterns on the back, fourteen yuan equivalent to ten taels of silver, which society called "fire." After the founding of the Republic of China, the Sichuan Military Government abandoned the dragon-patterned steel molds and recast "Chinese character dollars." The front had the words "Made by the Sichuan Military Government, one Sichuan silver coin," and the back had the seal character "Han," surrounded by eighteen small circles. In the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China, the Chongqing Copper Coin Bureau also minted silver coins, with the same form as those made by the Chengdu Mint, only with a line on the back of the "Han" character extending into the small circle of the outer line. Because of this difference, the people in the northwest Sichuan counties called it the "Chongqing version" to distinguish it from the silver coins made by the Chengdu factory. Later, after the establishment of the military district system, Chengdu merchants discriminated against the currency made in Chongqing. This situation was slightly eliminated after Liu Xiang entered Chengdu, but in the rural areas of northwest Sichuan, it was still refused. "Chinese character half-dollar" was only cast by the Chengdu factory in the eighth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the number of Sichuan troops increased, and salary payments were difficult. Because of the currency regulations, the silver content of the half-dollar was less than that of the full dollar, making it easier to make money. The mint stopped minting full dollars at that time and specialized in making half-dollars, the more they produced, the more profit they made, so the person in charge only sought to increase production and rushed to make large quantities. However, the mint's machinery was old and worn, and the finished product was unusually sloppy. The steel mold used was initially of the type "the corner of the Yuan character is open, and the corner of the character is prominent." Later, the people in charge of the mint changed frequently, and the style of the currency mold also changed frequently, resulting in the distinction between pointed flowers, round flowers, five petals, and six petals. The mint itself was state-run, but in Sichuan's spoils-sharing military district system, it was subordinate to Deng Xihou of the 28th Army. With this distribution, it was very easy for other armies to make money by manufacturing silver coins, and the ordnance repair shops of each army successively manufactured them. Generally, powerful division and brigade commanders took out their private property to purchase minting machinery. Coincidentally, a technician surnamed Li, who graduated from the Chengdu Advanced Industrial School, set up a machine factory that specialized in sand casting, car drilling. The division and brigade commanders ordered simple minting machines from him one after another. One could buy one for over a thousand yuan. With the machinery, they freely minted coins in their military districts, but the motive power was lacking, so they used manpower instead. Therefore, the manufactured coins were uneven in thickness and the patterns were blurred. Moreover, driven by the desire to get rich, dreaming of making a big fortune at once, the silver content in the coins can be said to be close to zero, and some were completely copper. The people called these five-corner coins "miscellaneous boards" because they were not made by the mint. The amount circulating in the market was about more than 30 million yuan. These silver coins contained too much copper, and in an instant, the businesses refused to accept them. Merchants followed the trend of the financial world, and Chengdu almost returned to a barter economy at that time. The value of the "miscellaneous boards" naturally plummeted, and the general public initially took these huge amounts of inferior coins in at a rate of one yuan for one silver dollar, but when they paid them out, one yuan was only worth two or three jiao in silver dollars. Stores were often closed due to this influence. When the military saw that the value of the miscellaneous boards was too low and they could not make any money, they stopped manufacturing them. Even so, they had indeed gotten rich early, only to the detriment of the general public who had no power or courage! Later, the three military headquarters established a joint office, which was organized by the 28th Army, the 29th Army, and the 24th Army. The public was extremely angry and presented them with a congratulatory couplet, saying: "Sichuan silver dollars are broken and dumb, the three dead men are Deng, Tian, and Liu." This is a sketch of the Sichuan currency situation; from this, we can also see the pitifulness of the people revolving in the arena of military force, and the only thing left to do is curse. Recently, the various military forces are still privately making silver dollars. Chen Shaowei, the special finance commissioner of Sichuan, has requested the central government to issue a clear prohibition. The people are very hopeful that this will become a reality soon. The Sichuan silver currency survey is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Silver Dollars</p>
<p>(1) Qing Dynasty Dragon Pattern Dollars The silver dollars made by various provinces in the Qing Dynasty can be used universally, such as Jilin, Hubei, and Jiangnan. However, some counties do not use the Beiyang and Xuenan-made ones, or use them at a 10% discount. If the dragon shape on the back of the coin is smaller than the ones circulating in the market, Dazu County calls it "Half Dragon Dollars," and the market completely refuses to use it.</p>
<p>(2) Sichuan Chinese Character Dollars Made by the Chengdu Mint, it is universally used in all counties. In Yunyang and Fengjie, it is used at a 2% discount. If the third stroke of the gold radical of the silver character in the Sichuan silver coin, although made in one stroke, is not horizontal, and is slightly curved from the beginning to the end, this kind of coin is commonly called "Crooked Flat Shoulder Pole." It is privately minted and is rejected by all counties.</p>
<p>(3) Yuan Head Dollars With an image of Yuan Shikai on the face, made in the third year of the Republic of China, it is universally used throughout Sichuan. Those made in the eighth, ninth, and tenth years of the Republic of China are rejected by the people in northwest Sichuan and southern Sichuan near Yunnan, who say that Yuan Shikai is dead and the gold and silver content is insufficient. Now that there is a shortage of coins, it can be circulated; however, some places still require a discount to use it. For example, the ones made in Luojiang in the third year, one yuan can be exchanged for 16,000 copper coins. The ones made in the ninth and tenth years, one yuan can only be exchanged for 1,000 to 3,000 copper coins. There is also a kind with Yuan's eyes open, commonly called "Open-Eyed Dollars." The counties in northwest Sichuan do not use it, and in eastern Sichuan, one yuan is used as eight jiao.</p>
<p>(4) Sun Yat-sen Dollars With an image of Mr. Sun Yat-sen on the face, with the words "Commemorative Coin of the Founding of the Republic," and those made by the Central Mint in the 22nd year are universally used. However, there are few cases of refusal to accept them in the towns of Wusheng County. Guson County requires a discount, such as one Yuan Head dollar can be exchanged for twelve jiao in silver, while one Sun Yat-sen coin can only be exchanged for ten jiao.</p>
<p>(5) Gold Character Dollars Made by the Chongqing Copper Coin Bureau in the eighth year of the Republic of China. Because the gold radical of the silver character in the silver dollars made by the Chengdu Mint is written as 金, while the one made in Chongqing is written as 金, the people call it "Gold Character Great Yuan." Most people refuse to use it. In counties near Chongqing, it is used at an 80% discount.</p>
<p>(6) Chongqing Qinggangba Dollars Privately minted, the writing is rougher, the market price is low, and most people do not use it.</p>
<p>(7) Chongqing Dollars Made by the Chongqing Copper Coin Bureau, the form is the same as those made by the Chengdu factory, only with a line on the back of the Chinese character surrounded by the straight stacks extending into the small circle. The people call it "Chongqing Dollars." It can now circulate in northwest Sichuan. However, Luojiang does not use this coin for transactions and can only exchange it for copper coins. The ones made in the eighth year with a manufacturing character, Dazu does not use. Also, the newly minted ones, Dazu calls "Whiskered Dollars" and does not use.</p>
<p>(8) Hechuan Dollars The character 圆 in the phrase "one yuan" on the coin face has a flatter shape, and the lines on the back only exist within the Chinese character. This kind is called "Hechuan Dollars." It is privately minted and is not used by any county.</p>
<p>(9) Yunnan Dollars Made by Yunnan in the early years of the Republic, the ones with fine writing are called "Steel Plate" and do not circulate. The ones with coarse writing are worth nine jiao in Qixian, and other counties refuse to use them.</p>
<p>(10) Chishui Dollars Made by Zhou Xicheng, the former chairman of Guizhou, in Chishui. The character 圆 in the phrase "one yuan" is prominent, commonly called "Zhou Da Ban." The silver content of the silver coins is very low. The eastern counties of Sichuan use them at a 50-60% discount, Yongchuan uses them at an 80% discount, and the counties in northwest Sichuan refuse to use them.</p>
<p>(11) Banchun Tibetan Dollars Made by the British in India for the use of Tibetans. It has the words "One Yuan" in English, Chinese, and Tibetan, and the face has the British coat of arms and a portrait. The silver content is higher than other types, and the people in northwest Sichuan value it very much. Most people keep them deeply at home and are unwilling to circulate them on the market.</p>
<p>As for the broken and dumb various silver coins circulating in the market, a surcharge must be paid for acceptance. For example, in Guanxian, western Sichuan, if they are glossy, dumb, or slightly damaged, each coin must be surcharged four or five hundred to one thousand, with no market price. The amount of the surcharge is negotiated by both parties.</p>
<p>Half Dollars (5-Jiao Coins)</p>
<p>(1) Yunnan Half Dollars With a dragon pattern on the back and four beads around, one bead is just right at the dragon's tail, named "Beng Er Zhu," commonly used. The price is high, about nine jiao for a dollar. The ones without the return bead are not used. Also, the ones with longer dragon feet are called "Long-Foot Dragon," which cannot circulate in all counties. Shehong uses this coin as a silver standard.</p>
<p>(2) Sichuan Dragon Half Dollars Made by the Sichuan Mint, commonly used. However, in Bishan, except for the towns of Laifeng, Dingjia, Masi, and Zhengxin, it can be used, but other towns do not use it. The value is slightly higher than the Chinese Character Half Dollars.</p>
<p>(3) Sichuan Chinese Character Half Dollars Made by the Chengdu Mint, commonly used. It is used at a 60% discount in the market.</p>
<p>(4) Tang Head Half Dollars With an image of Tang Jiyao, made in Yunnan, the market calls it "Banner Version." It is commonly used in southern, western, and northern Sichuan. Huayang uses it at an 80% discount, and the rest use it at 70% or less.</p>
<p>(5) Yuan Head Half Dollars Commonly used, with an image of Yuan Shikai, the market uses it at a 75% discount.</p>
<p>(6) Yunnan New Half Dollars The people call it "Steel Plate." It can be used in counties near Yunnan, and other counties refuse to use it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e170">Reorganization of Sichuan Land Tax <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Duan Zhongrong</p>
<p>The Importance of Sichuan Land Tax</p>
<p>Since 1842, after the opening of ports, the great powers have implemented their aggressive policies in various parts of our country. Sichuan, with its vast territory, diligent people, and abundant resources, is particularly coveted by imperialists. Britain already has considerable economic influence in Sichuan and is eagerly seeking to expand it. The Deutsch-Asiatische Petroleum Gesellschaft loan case, which caused a stir last autumn, is clear evidence of this. Moreover, there is the so-called "Greater Tibet Plan." If this aggressive plan succeeds, it will realize its "Greater Tibetan Empire," and Sichuan will likely become its colony at that time. American kerosene is also being vigorously promoted in Sichuan. The American Standard Oil Company and the British Asiatic Petroleum Company monopolize the entire Sichuan kerosene market, with their sales outlets reaching into the towns and villages. Few Sichuan residents do not use British or American kerosene. Russian fabrics, German dyes, and Japanese shipping and marine products are all targeting Sichuan for aggression. Therefore, the Sichuan economy has reached a period of total collapse.</p>
<p>In addition, after a long period of division and infighting in Sichuan, with constant warfare and widespread destruction, the people's livelihoods are exhausted. Corrupt officials and local bullies take advantage of the situation, leading to the rise of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Xu Xiangqian, He Long, and others, who engaged in banditry. After the Central Army entered Sichuan and dealt a heavy blow, the bandit forces were greatly weakened, and important locations were recovered. However, at present, to reform Sichuan, develop industry and commerce, resist the aggression of the great powers, eliminate the remaining bandits in Sichuan, and eliminate the crisis facing China's future, it is essential to have a stable and substantial financial foundation. Since the division of tax revenue between the central and local governments, land tax has been the main source of revenue for each province. In Sichuan, at a time when industry and commerce are bankrupt, reform and innovation are particularly dependent on the promotion of land tax.</p>
<p>The Crisis of Sichuan Land Tax</p>
<p>Sichuan's finances have always been known for their chaos, with arbitrary levies and disregard for the people's lives. The elders of Sichuan have long suffered from harsh government, especially the exploitation of land tax. Not only has it increased rapidly and been excessively pre-collected, but the additional miscellaneous levies are also very heavy, leading to a crisis. The current situation of Sichuan land tax is listed below for illustration.</p>

<p>The above is the land tax situation before the 15th year of the Republic of China. After the 15th year, the defense zone system was firmly established. Before February of this year, although there was a provincial government in name, it only held a nominal title. Not only was there no unified financial system in the province, but there was also no fixed budget for revenue and expenditure in each defense zone, making it very difficult to get a full picture of Sichuan's financial situation. It is only possible to investigate their financial situation from sources other than official reports. The land tax after the 15th year of the Republic of China is listed below, based on the recent income of the 21st Army, for reference.</p>

<p>Looking at the first table, the total revenue of Sichuan land tax listed in the national budget over the years is more than 6 million yuan. Sichuan has more than 140 counties, with an average land tax burden of more than 46,000 yuan per county. Since the 15th year of the Republic of China, the amount of land tax collected has expanded, and the burden on each county has greatly increased. Taking the 17th to 18th years of the Republic of China as an example, the 21st Army's defense zone was only 16 counties, but its land tax revenue was more than 2 million yuan, with an average burden of more than 100,000 yuan per county. Taking the 19th to 21st years of the Republic of China as an example, the 21st Army's defense zone was 28 counties, and its land tax revenue reached more than 9 million yuan, with an average burden of more than 300,000 yuan per county. Since the 15th year of the Republic of China, land tax collection has only increased and not decreased. Looking at the second table, Sichuan Province's land tax has several collections a year, or even more than ten collections. Some people in Sichuan have paid the grain tax for the 50th to 60th years of the Republic of China, and some have paid the grain tax for the 80th to 90th years of the Republic of China. The tax burden borne by the people generally accounts for more than six-tenths of their production. Taking Meishan as an example, the regular tax and surtax for each tael of grain in the county must be paid at 86 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 cents. Each tael of grain can yield an average of 45 shi of grain (each shi is 250 jin). At the current market price, each shi is worth about 3 yuan, so 45 shi can be sold for 135 yuan. After deducting the grain tax, only 48 yuan, 7 jiao, and 4 cents remain. (Sichuan Monthly Report, Number 28) Some even have to pay more than 100 yuan per tael of grain for the whole year, which is more than ten times the tax amount in the past. Even if all the production is paid, it is still not enough. In addition, there are miscellaneous levies. Yang Zifeng, a gentry member of Shuangjiang Town in Tongnan, Sichuan, owns thousands of acres of farmland and is the wealthiest man in the county. He has a total grain quota of more than 40 taels. In recent years, due to poor harvests and heavy grain taxes, his income cannot cover his expenses, and he is heavily in debt. He has been selling his land everywhere to pay off his debts, but after selling for many days, no one is willing to buy it, leading to the saying that he is "begging with a golden bowl." In Qinglong Township, Jiang'an, a farmer named Wan Yihe has only a few acres of land, with an annual rent of 12 shi of grain and a grain tax of 8 qian and 6 fen. Each year, he has to pay a total of more than 100 yuan. Because the harvest from his fields is insufficient and the tax collectors come to his door to demand payment, Yihe is unable to continue farming and has petitioned the collection bureau to return his land to the state. The collection bureau replied: "Land tax is the government's revenue, and paying taxes is the people's duty. This bureau is responsible for political power and is ordered to make every penny public. We have no authority to reduce or exempt taxes. The claim that the harvest is less than the expenses is a common situation. There is no such thing as a citizen returning their land to the state, and this request is not to be discussed." (December 21, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Beiping Morning Post) In Yong, Rong, Lu, Fu, Long, and other counties in southeastern Sichuan, the rural areas are bankrupt, and many small gentry are heavily in debt and unable to repay them, so they are detained by creditors in the government, and the government can only auction off their land to repay the debts. Often, even if the entire property of those who owe thousands or tens of thousands of yuan is sold off, it is not enough to repay 20-30% of the debt. Moreover, at a time when the situation is difficult and no one is willing to buy the property, the government has to repeatedly lower the price and announce the sale, but after repeated announcements, there are still no buyers. Such notices are seen daily in Yong, Rong, Lu, Long, and Fu. For example, land with a rent of 20 shi is auctioned off for only 1,000 yuan, but few people accept it. The reason for this is nothing more than the shortage of cash and the excessive tax burden. (December 23, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Chongqing Commercial Daily) Xu Tingyao said: "The people of Sichuan Province are suffering unspeakable hardships. The grain tax has already been collected up to the 70th year of the Republic of China, with some areas collecting 12 years of grain in one year. The people cannot bear the burden and often post notices on their doors stating that they are unable to repay the debt and asking the government to confiscate their land deeds and stop pursuing them for repayment." (Xu Tingyao's talk upon returning to Beijing from Sichuan, see the April 12th News Report) From this, it can be seen that the people of Sichuan are excessively oppressed by the land tax, and their ability to pay taxes has reached its limit. The government's collection of land tax is tantamount to confiscating the people's land. Therefore, people are selling their land to pay the grain tax and asking the government to take over their land. And because the land tax burden is too heavy, no one is willing to buy the land.</p>
<p>A Western philosopher said, "What is collected from income is called taxation, and what is collected from capital is called robbery." How can the people bear the collection of robbery? The Yellow Turban Rebellion in the Han Dynasty, the peasant uprising at the end of the Ming Dynasty, and the independence of the United States all had reasons for harsh taxation. Sichuan's land tax is extraordinarily harsh, which has led to the rise of bandits and the spread of communist rebels. The resolution of the National Financial Conference on the land tax case last year stipulated that the surtax should not exceed the regular tax in principle, and that in areas where the original tax was light, the total of the regular tax and surtax should not exceed one percent of the land price. The existing land tax surtax, whether it exceeds the regular tax or not, should not be increased in any name from the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and those that have exceeded the regular tax should be reduced within a time limit. However, the surtax on Sichuan's land tax not only exceeds the regular tax but is more than twenty times higher (see the fourth table). In addition, there are miscellaneous levies apportioned by grain that have not been calculated. Although the Sichuan Provincial Government decided to reduce the land tax by a small amount in each county after the reform, it also levied three times the temporary military expenses and 10% of the remittance fee on top of the regular tax. This not only violates the laws of the Financial Conference on increasing surtaxes and reducing them but also contradicts the cultivation of tax sources and the relief of the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Policies for Reorganizing Sichuan Land Tax</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, today's Sichuan land tax is in such a crisis. Reorganization work is not only urgent but must also have appropriate methods that can effectively reduce the burden on the people and promote the reform of Sichuan's government. The reorganization policies are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Reorganization of Cultivated Land: A. Accurately measure the total number of fields and acres in each county and apportion them equally according to the original total grain quota of each county. B. The measurement method is based on fields and acres, excluding barren land, mountains, forests, and yin-yang houses. C. Dry land, vegetable gardens, and riverbeds are calculated as one acre for every three acres. D. Divide the fields and acres in each county into four grades: A, B, C, and D, with grade A being above one dan, grade B being above eight dou, grade C being above six dou, and grade D being above four dou. In this way, the tax will be equal, and the disadvantages of having land without grain or having grain without land can be avoided.</p>
<p>(2) Defining Micro-Collection Procedures: In the past, Sichuan had a defense zone system, and each did its own thing, allowing officials and clerks to engage in fraud and corruption. There were often no fixed rules, resulting in chaotic grain collection procedures with a variety of methods that were impossible to investigate. It was difficult for the government to audit, and embezzlement was common. Therefore, collection rules should be defined to eliminate the bad habits of the past. A. From the 24th year onwards, silver and grain should be used uniformly for a one-time collection, with pre-calculated quotas presented to the provincial financial department for record. B. Before the collection begins in the 24th year, each county should compile a register of all grain households, acreage, and the amount of grain to be collected in the county, and fill it in in detail according to the regulations, without perfunctory omissions. Based on the register, a joint form should be compiled, the form of which will be made and distributed by the Financial Department, and each county shall not prepare it freely. C. The joint form is divided into four items: 1. Stub, 2. License, 3. Notice, 4. Report (sent to the Financial Department for record). This method is the four-part receipt. The joint form must be filled out in regular script and stamped with a seal, and other simplified characters are not allowed. The amount of grain listed on the form should include all the grain taxes to be paid. D. The collection procedures for the 24th year should be completed before the collection begins, and not just a blank paper presented after the collection. In the future, the micro-collection of land tax should be approved by the Financial Department or started after receiving an order from the Financial Department. E. Before the annual land tax collection, each county must send a notice to each household in advance for inspection, and post the field grade, tax rate, tax amount, and other matters that households should pay attention to, and print a brief explanation and distribute it to administrative personnel in various districts and townships for publicity, so that households can pay on time, to prevent "losses from lifting grain" and the bad habits of individual officials extorting money. F. Each county should, before the annual collection, submit a detailed list of the tax rate per acre and the total amount and percentage of the regular and surtax of the county to the Financial Department for verification. G. The land tax collection materials, forms, etc. in each county must have at least the following items: 1. Daily registration book for issuing joint forms, 2. Daily cash receipt book, payment book, and daily report form for collected taxes. This form should be prepared in duplicate, one submitted to the Financial Department and one posted on the government newspaper.</p>
<p>(3) Decreasing Tax Amount: The decline of rural areas in recent years is mostly due to heavy taxes. The heaviness of Sichuan's land tax is already beyond imagination, coupled with the burden of miscellaneous levies, the people's strength is even more exhausted. In this way, to revive the rural areas and build Sichuan is like asking a three-year-old child to lift a hundred-pound tripod, how can it be possible? Last year, the abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and land tax surtaxes accounted for more than 3,000 tax items and more than 18 million yuan in tax fraud (Shen Bao, December 15 last year), but Sichuan's land tax, which had the heaviest tax burden and the most surtax items, did not abolish any tax items or reduce any yuan of tax money. Although the new Sichuan Provincial Government ordered the abolition of harsh taxes and the cessation of land tax pre-collection on March 1, it levied double the surtax and 10% of the remittance fee in addition to one tax. This kind of method, which is different in name but not in reality, is of no benefit to the people, so the people of Sichuan still have the sorrow of being oppressed by land tax. (See Chen Shaoyu's letter to the Sichuan Financial Department in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on March 10) If the people are not sufficient, who will the ruler be sufficient with? Now that the farmers in Sichuan have no ability to bear the burden, if they are not relieved, the number of people who return their land to the government will increase, and even if it does not increase, the amount of unpaid taxes will inevitably increase day by day. At this time, the impact on finance will inevitably be greater than in the past. Therefore, reducing land tax is an urgent matter. However, local finances have been poor for a long time, and careers cannot be abandoned, so how can mutual funds be reduced suddenly? Therefore, the compromise is to adopt the method of gradual reduction. A. The 1 jiao and 3 fen of the Youth League Committee fee should be reduced by half each year from the 24th year and cleared in the 25th year. (Reason) Since there are troop funds, there is no need for Youth League Committee fees (see table 5). B. The 4 yuan of construction announcement fees should be reduced by 1 yuan each year from the 24th year and cleared in the 27th year. (Reason) The construction announcement fee in the land tax surcharge is very heavy. If you want to reduce the land tax, you must reduce this fee. Moreover, there are construction funds in the land tax surcharge, so this fee is really cumbersome. C. The contract tax of 5 yuan and 2 jiao should be reduced by one-third each year from the 24th year and cleared in the 26th year. (Reason) This fee is the heaviest in the land tax surcharge. The contract tax originated from the sale of land. Paying grain tax is not the sale of land, so why pay the contract tax? Moreover, the sale of land requires another contract tax in addition to the grain tax, which is obviously unfair, so it should be gradually reduced. D. The Jingzhuang of 1 yuan and 3 jiao should be abolished on average from the 24th year to the 25th year. (Reason) The use of Jingzhuang has little to do with political people's livelihood. E. The house tax of 5 jiao should be abolished on average in two years from the 24th year. (Reason) Since there is a house tax collection in major cities, it is inappropriate to add a house tax to the land tax. (The above tax items are all in table 5) The nature of the remaining deliberation tax items will determine the length of the gradual reduction period, so that the surname Xing Ting Sui will be reached when it meets the standards stipulated by the Financial Conference last year.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of offsetting after reorganizing the port land tax and reducing the land tax, in Sichuan, there is only one way to tighten up. Sichuan's finances have long been exhausted, and it is difficult to develop new sources of income for a while. The central government can allocate part of the local tobacco and alcohol license tax and stamp tax. In Sichuan, it has not been handed over to the central government for a long time. Even if the central government allocates all of this tax to Sichuan, Sichuan's financial income will not increase at all.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday. The market atmosphere was more sluggish than before. In addition, head lining was not abundant, and people were sluggish, causing the call loan market price to remain unchanged. The morning and afternoon were both 2 jiao. Call loan transactions were increasingly sluggish. The morning market turnover was more than 1.5 million, new transactions more than 500,000; no transactions in the afternoon market; the small general meeting turnover was more than 700,000, the loan transaction for foreign money was about 200,000 for redemption, no new transactions. Money shops received more than 27 million in public bills for foreign money, remittances from various routes more than 300,000, no banknote withdrawals, only issued secret notes of more than 400,000, customer source 100,000, no outflow, the rest such as collection were suspended due to bank closure. As for Jiangnan silver, the morning and afternoon markets were both 832 yuan, up 2 yuan from the previous day. The trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market, and none in the afternoon market. The situation of Guangdong silver was very stable, with only a small 4 jiao increase in the morning market to 732 yuan and 5 jiao, and then rising back 3 jiao in the afternoon market to 732 yuan and 8 jiao, so the result was only a decrease of 1 jiao. The trading volume was 70,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market.

<p>Last week, the transaction of this month in the Hua Shang Securities Exchange has been close to the last week, in addition to this, there is only one day left for the market, and the number of chips has not decreased sharply, and there has been a continuous increase. The fronts on both sides are expanding, so the volatility is becoming more violent. At the beginning, with the Zhangbei Incident, people's hearts became more agitated, and the short side became stronger, and the market situation became more sluggish. Subsequently, the financial sector became active, and arbitrage and new longs rose together, and the market was boosted by this, and the fatigue disappeared and it was thriving. Looking at the market process as a whole, the speed of the market price reversal is particularly noteworthy. Taking Jin Duan No. 1 as an example, the market price once fell to 69 yuan on Tuesday, and it rose to 72 yuan on Friday. The difference between the two or three-day market reached a huge amount of 1 to 2 yuan. Although investment is enthusiastic, it is true that it has been created. According to the sudden rise of the financial sector, it was not initially expected by the short side. In fact, after the collapse of Mei Feng Bank, depositors' faith in foreign merchants was not as strong as before, and many transferred their deposits to Chinese banks. The deposit amount of each bank increased sharply, and the 40% reserve of bonds suddenly felt insufficient. The Ministry of Finance's inspection of the treasury followed, so they had to absorb it to make up the amount, and the semi-annual closing relationship also happily raised the market price. In summary, the market price results last week were still an overall increase of 3-5 jiao to 1 yuan and 2 jiao, but the recent collapse of Zheng Liu was 2 jiao, and Jiu Liu fell by half a yuan. The total transaction volume for June and July still reached 16,450,500 yuan, but compared with the previous 20 million yuan, it has already shown signs of decline.

<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton was due to good news from Liverpool. Peers bought July, the government bought May, and local and brokers also bought. Each month rose 1 to 7 pounds, and then fell back once due to Liverpool selling and the good weather of Texas. The firmness of the July period is quite eye-catching. Recently, the cotton storage buyers have sold the July period, believing that in addition to 20,000 bales, there is no need to limit the price or transfer all of them. The current demand is sluggish, the spinning and weaving conditions are not good, and the market was tired in the middle due to weather forecasts, and then became firm with short covering. The closing was stable. The spot price rose 10 pounds, and the futures rose 4 to 9 pounds. British cotton spot prices remained unchanged, and futures fell 2 points. The Indian cotton market was small, and short positions were slightly covered. The Pingguo and Erjun remained unchanged, the Omla rose 0.5 rupees, and the Bairoxi rose 0.25 rupees.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only a dozen or so boats arrived from out-of-town merchants (carrying a total of over a thousand piculs of goods). Due to the continued rain, the market remained sluggish with few customers, making business exceptionally slow. The market was weak, and the price of each type of thick japonica rice fell by two dimes, while although some Qingdao merchants suddenly showed interest in purchasing thin indica rice in bulk, the quantity was only around three hundred bags. Their price was only slightly lower. The market generally weakened.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Essays from a Comfortable Retreat <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>— Descriptions of Several Creatures</p>
<p>The books written by Xu Zhuo'an certainly amount to more than just these thin six volumes. My collection isn't at hand, so I can't check for the moment. Based on the book's content, this is probably a compilation of his writings after the fall of the nation. But it's already "quite impressive." From the book, we can see that he's not only skilled in humor, as we commonly know, but also a remarkable "nature writer."</p>
<p>The book is named "Essays from a Comfortable Retreat" because his study is called "Comfortable Retreat." How could he "hang a couch" when he lived in "a secluded mountain阁, with no other dwellings in the suburbs, only orchids?" This was specially built for him by his classmate Miao Fan on Mount Ao. The book has prefaces by Miao Fan, Fang □, Wen Deyi, and Li Qing at the age of eighty-three. Essays, miscellanea, and short articles make up most of the book.</p>
<p>Zhou Zuoren once called art "a world of refuge." After the fall of the Ming dynasty, and unwilling to serve, Xu Zhuo'an naturally became one of the "artistic refugees." He stayed in the mountains, writing poetry and prose to dispel his bitterness and melancholy. To avoid literary persecution, he had to abandon the "broad path" for the "small path." This was unavoidable, a sorrow shared throughout the ages. This small path differed for each person. Some became monks, some compiled records of former loyalists, some mingled among the "common people," some traveled around desperately looking at flowers, while Xu Zhuo'an took a unique path, studying creatures, seeking humanity among small creatures.</p>
<p>He wrote a lot about creatures, and like Zhuang Zhou and Aesop, he used them as the basis for fables. However, when we link each of the morals he attached, few can be considered high-quality. Most are quite pedantic. Only by simply looking at how he describes creatures can we discover that he's worthy of our attention. Let's first see which creatures he wrote about:</p>
<p>Dragon, albatross, chicken, dog, cormorant, ant, fly, gooseherd, horse, snake, stork, crab, mule, tiger, fish, pangolin, bee, monkey, sparrow, elephant, tomb, cow, frog, spider, dog, insect, rat, rabbit, deer.</p>
<p>There are roughly forty species in total. He liked them very much, felt they were better than humans, and spared no effort in describing them. He liked to use peculiar titles for his articles, such as "Five Reflections," "Five Sighs," "Five Smiles," "Five Mercies," "Five Oddities," like "Biography of a Coin," "Record of a Half-Faced Man," "Record of Three are Tigers," "Record of a Strange Disease." His eccentric personality is clearly expressed in his titles.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here are just some short articles about describing creatures. Writing about "Albatross," he said: "Herons have a nature of being close to water, feeding on aquatic insects. Each time they raise their young, they peck and feed them. Those that can't withstand the pecking and fall are numerous. Clever children often enter the mountain nests of herons in midsummer to collect fish and earthworms, and they always succeed. There's a bird called the albatross, which is lazy and clumsy, unable to peck for food on its own, and unwilling to compete with herons for food. So it often perches in trees, waiting for the herons to peck and accidentally drop food, which it then eats. The herons don't necessarily pass by frequently or drop food, and even if they do, the albatross might miss it. If this happens, the albatross gets no food. However, the albatross never starves to death." He also wrote about "Cormorant," saying:</p>
<p>"Cormorants are a type of waterfowl, ducks with strong beaks, skilled at catching fish. Many people along the river raise them. They are carried on small rafts to places where fish gather in the water. When the cormorant sees a fish, it dives deep and quickly catches it. If it's small, it holds it in its beak and comes out. If it's large and it can't manage it, it breaks its wings and calls for its kind to fight together, and it won't stop until it gets it. But the fishermen first put a small ring around their necks, so the larger fish cannot be eaten. When they get it, they take it away. Even if the small fish has been swallowed to the ring, it gets stuck and can't go down. The fishermen then lift it up and strip it out, and the fish comes out of the throat. When they are extremely hungry, they feed them one or two fish, and then drive them on again. Year after year, cormorants are always enemies of fish, and they have a reputation for greed and violence, but they are never full, while the fishermen sit back and enjoy the great profit." Then he wrote about "Gooseherd," saying:</p>
<p>"Geese have a habit of sleeping soundly. When they sleep in the wild, fearing human plots, they have a lone goose on guard. When it sees something, it cries out loudly, like a messenger calling out, and the flock of geese immediately gets up, this is called the gooseherd. Some clever people store fire in bamboo tubes, sneak up to the geese, shake the tube, and sparks fly out. Then they hide again. When the geese see the fire, they think there are enemies, they shout in alarm. The flock of geese respond with flapping wings, but after a while, there's silence and nothing to be seen. So they suspect the gooseherd is tricking them, and peck at it lightly, then go back to sleep. After a while, the person gets up again, raises the fire and shakes it, and the gooseherd cries out again, and the flock of geese respond again. After a while, there's silence again, so they get even more suspicious and peck it even harder. After repeating this several times, the fire is shaken four times, so they are alarmed four times, and pecked four times. The gooseherd sees that the fire is harmless and can't stand the pecking, so it gets annoyed and doesn't warn anymore. The flock of geese also stop responding. Then they spread a net all over their sleeping place, make a noise, and attack. The flock of geese wake up in a dream, and they are all caught in the net and can't escape."</p>
<p>Describing the character and behavior of creatures like this, and putting most of his effort into it, is rare. These nature writings are rarely seen among contemporary writers. Unfortunately, Zhuo'an feared that readers wouldn't understand his intentions, so he added explanations that were twice as long below each passage, which damaged the value of the article. In fact, without adding another word, the meaning would be clear enough.</p>
<p>From this tendency, Zhuo'an seems to be a fabulist of his time, with a sophisticated literary skill. I think these writings are more valuable in meaning than the popular mountain essays of that time. Writing about those trivial matters from his life isn't as good as writing about these things, which also have biological significance.</p>
<p>In addition to writing about the character and behavior of animals, Zhuo'an also liked to write about their special skills, skills that had been trained by humans. There are also some in "Essays from a Comfortable Retreat," such as "Monkey Pear Garden," "Ant Captain," "Frog Professor," "Sparrow Teacher," "Dog Husking," "Insect Pitfall," "Rat Theft," "Spider Catching." The first three are "biological acting" trained for livelihood by performers at the time.</p>
<p>"Monkey Pear Garden" describes monkey shows, which are similar to what we see now. The difference is that the tunes sung and their tones are used as commands. When the tune changes to a female tone, the monkey "takes out a powdered face from the basket and puts it on, acting with a soft and swaying posture." "Ant Captain" describes ant sellers who store yellow and black ants in two bamboo tubes. When playing, they are released to fight fiercely, and after the battle, they return to their tubes in order. "Frog Professor" is more special, and seems to be unseen by us:</p>
<p>"A basket contains a dozen or so frogs. When they reach a house, they are taken out. Among them is an old frog, sitting cross-legged facing south. The other frogs are lined up on the east and west sides, facing each other solemnly. After a while, the old frog makes a sound, and the other frogs respond in turn. Then it calls again and again, and they respond again and again. 'Xiao Xiao Ka Ka,' the sound is loud. After a long time, the old frog stops, and the frogs also stop. The performer tilts the basket to collect them, and the old frog crawls in slowly, followed by the others, without a single one in disorder. This is called 'Frog Reading,' the one sitting on top is called the Professor Teacher, and those beside are called disciples."</p>
<p>I think this trick is really ironic. It's a pity that this kind of show has been lost. Xu Zhuo'an said in this passage that the way of teachers and students "still relies on the Frog Academy to preserve it," his emotions are evident. "Sparrow Teacher" is the sparrow fortune-telling of today. "Dog Milling" is a kind of business, where they are trained to husk rice for people in exchange for money. The method is:</p>
<p>"Support wood to make a frame, with a horizontal board as a pestle, using an axle to make it movable. Place the frame on the ground, and the dog raises its front two feet, putting the board on the horizontal wood of the frame, as if leaning its hands on it. Then, it steps on the board with its hind feet, operating it up and down, the sound of the pestle is slow and steady. Call it to stop and it stops, want it to mill and drive it again, going to dozens of houses a day without tiring."</p>
<p>"Insect Pitfall" is a kind of ant-eating insect, whose method of getting ants is to dig a pitfall on the road, causing the ants to slide in, and then eat them. "Rat Theft" is quite unexpected, writing about rats who like to steal chicken eggs. The method of stealing is: "Use a strong one, raise its feet and lie on its back, and a group of rats gather the eggs on its abdomen, holding them firmly, then it walks backwards, biting its tail and dragging it. Crossing walls and holes is easy." This is truly unheard of. "Spider Catching" describes how the jumping spider catches flies, which we are familiar with.</p>
<p>The skills of creatures are mostly so cute. How Zhuo'an placed his spirit on these small creatures after the fall of the nation is evident. Although he didn't want to be a biologist, his interest in creatures was strong. There's also a passage about "Goldfish," which is also very well written:</p>
<p>"A pond is clear and sparkling, with countless goldfish raised in it. They swim in teams, shaded by willow trees, making their colors even more beautiful. When the wind passes over the pond, the inverted shadows sway, like hundreds of fishing lines, appearing and disappearing in the waves. The fish also wag their tails and avoid them, then come back again, winding around, making them very playful." ("Record of Welcoming Garden Events") There are many such articles in his "Records," which are very "spirited," but that's no longer within the scope of what I want to say.</p>
<p>"Essays from a Comfortable Retreat" has many good articles, and the description of creatures is its unique feature. His writing, in old words, belongs to the "fresh and refined" style. To say that he's a "master," naturally isn't enough, but it's always a readable work. What sets it apart from many other loyalist writers is that, no matter where the sentiments are placed in other collections, you can always see many loyalist sorrows and intensely emotional writing head-on. But "Essays from a Comfortable Retreat" doesn't have that. You can only see from his history that this was a kind of helpless placement of his spirit.</p>
<p>"Essays from a Comfortable Retreat" is a banned book, rarely seen. The reason for the ban is probably because it contains an essay for Qian Qianyi, a letter to Qian Qianyi, and a biography of Liu Rushi, which is very well written. I obtained it at a low price by chance, and it's been four months already. Due to being busy and the pages being scattered, I haven't read it carefully. Also, due to poverty, it almost changed owners twice. Today, because it has been repaired and is in good condition, I took it back and read it. I'm very fortunate that the two buyers didn't buy it at that time. In addition to my joy, I wrote this note amidst the constant reading sounds outside the window, on the night of June 18, 1935.</p>

<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>Loving paintings (even though I can't paint myself) is probably a common feeling, because everyone has a love for beauty. I'm one of those people who can't paint but loves paintings. Because of my love for painting, I've met many great painters. Mr. Wang Jiyuan, who recently held an exhibition at the Hua'an Building, is also a painter I deeply admire. He's someone who's most loyal to his art, and he also loves to travel, so he has great gains every year. This spring, he first traveled to Hong Kong and the Philippines, bringing back many works. In the misty clouds and drizzling rain, he depicted a Hong Kong as soft and beautiful as a young girl. Hong Kong, which has been married for more than ninety years, is actually so lovely! He also depicted the sunset of the Philippines, a molten iron-like scene, stimulating, passionate. The colors of the tropical Philippines pour out before your eyes, instantly transporting you to that hot place. At the same time, it's a vast sea, unfolding at your feet, a brilliant deep blue, jumping, moving, this is the unique blue of the Philippines. Two landscapes, one cold and one hot, form a wonderful contrast! After returning from the Philippines, I sent him on a trip to Tokyo not long after. From Tokyo, he brought back images of the islands near the Inland Sea. The rough lines and striking colors capture the character of our lovely neighbor in one stroke! What fascinates me the most is another harvest from his travels, the ink paintings of Shaoxing he made while traveling there. Shaoxing, I spent several years playing in the mountains and rivers of Shaoxing. Who, thinking of "on the road to Shanyin," can deny that beautiful landscape? Mr. Wang Jiyuan cleverly used ink to depict it. "Spring Rain at Yu Mausoleum" took his soul, and "Spring at East Lake" also came under his brush. "Dayu Mausoleum," "Roaring Mountain," "Lu You Reading Place," the famous scenes of Shaoxing, separated for many years, thank you Mr. Wang, most of them came to my eyes. The wonderful framing is just right; the harmonious blend of Chinese and Western colors is bright and beautiful, without a trace of forced patchwork, like Fang Weng quickly opened a picture, depicting the fun of a bridge like a rainbow, water adding to the sky, and heaven calling Fang Weng. I saw Mr. Wang's exhibition several days ago, but the impression is still very fresh. I wonder if those who have visited have the same feeling. It's admirable that Mr. Wang is so diligent in his work, and it's even more admirable that he can always maintain the heart of an artist and not become a politician as a painter. What's more, his harvests are so rich and fulfilling?</p>

<p>— Translated by Chen Yin of Germany's Stormo She</p>
<p>The mayor walked away, and Fritz brought him a glass of wine to the door. "Wish you peace, master!" he said earnestly; "Now I want to dance with Nellie, she dances very well."</p>
<p>But just at this time, his boy friend, with a full glass of wine, also ran over in a swarm. They clinked glasses with him, imitating his bowing! He bowed every time he clinked glasses, it was really too much! And said some humorous polite words.</p>
<p>Nellie stood still, her eyes did not leave her father; but I heard how her little teeth gnashed.</p>
<p>The musicians started playing again, and the other boys ran back into the hall. I was still standing with Nellie at the door.</p>
<p>"Aha, Mr. Philip!" the tailor called out and held out his hand to me, "They are all handsome and lovely young gentlemen! But let me say a sincere word! You and Nellie, you and Nellie..., Mr. Philip!" At this time, his small dark eyes looked at his child's face very gently: as if moved by an irresistible agitation, he stretched his long arm into the hall and pulled her to his chest. "My child, my baby!" he said softly. The little girl kissed him, embracing his neck with both hands with a warm and sad tenderness, and leaning her beautiful little head on his shoulder. But then she left him, and held his hand tightly, speaking to him softly and earnestly. I didn't understand her words: but I saw her eyes looking at his eyes with a pleading look, and saw her little hands trembling as she stroked his haggard face, as if comforting his pain. At first, he smiled and shook his head doubtfully: but the joyful confidence that he had just shown when declaring his position gradually disappeared from his eyes. "I know, I know," he murmured, "You love your poor old father," but now the music started to play the tune for the "opposite dance," he shook hands with his daughter, silently, without looking into the hall again, and walked away along the long corridor.</p>
<p>At this time, Fritz came over and invited his female dance partner. —She still danced as calmly as usual: but the usual carefree, dreamy look had disappeared, and in this waltz, she only showed a gentle and serious attitude. During the break, she stared straight ahead like a statue, pushing her bright black hair back from her temples with both hands. She seemed not to have heard her male dance partner's jokes, and they slipped past her ears.</p>
<p>After the "opposite dance" was over, the dancing we had learned was also over, but our interest in dancing was not over. Our order sheet also had "Waltz," "Scottish Dance," "Carola Dance," and even a "Cotillion,"—I had prepared ribbons and flowers, planning to give them to Nellie when dancing the "Cotillion."</p>

<h3 id="e180">Nostalgia <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>Reading Shanghai newspapers, I learned that Shen Xiling's film "Nostalgia" is being screened these days. I don't know the plot, but looking at its advertisements, it seems to depict joys and sorrows, with some interspersed gunfire and cannon smoke. The advertisement quotes Li Houzhu's words, saying: "When will the spring flowers and autumn moon end? How much of the past do you know? The small building experienced the east wind again last night. The old country cannot bear to see the moon in the sky. The jade steps and carved railings should still be there, but the fair faces have changed. How much sorrow can you have? It's just like a river of spring water flowing eastward." It can be seen that the so-called "nostalgia" is probably talking about the longing of travelers, at most it's the sorrow of prisoners.</p>
<p>However, in their countryside, a film is also being screened, and its title is also "Nostalgia." I don't know who the director is, but the plot is really tragic. The acting of the actors, especially, is something that no other film can bring out. Every drop of tear, every drop of blood, shows the sincere pain in their hearts.</p>
<p>The scene of this film is very large, but what I saw was just a corner.</p>
<p>During the plum rain season last year, not a single drop of rain fell; fortunately, there was water in the river, and the early rice was lucky enough to survive. However, after paying taxes and rent, what was left on the heads of the farmers was still empty. Everyone was hoping that the late rice would be better, leaving some coarse grains to make a living. However, for one day, two days, ten days, it never rained. By the time it should have been harvested, the fields were filled with disorderly weeds. The cracks in the cracked soil allowed the feet of the farmers to sink in everywhere. Even the grasshoppers and locusts that specialized in harming rice seedlings had starved to death. There was no way to find half a grain of rice.</p>
<p>Wandering and dying, I don't know how those farmers got through the winter. But winter finally passed. The remaining living farmers had new hope as soon as spring arrived. They took on high-interest loans, found some hard capital, planted seedlings, and lifted water. While cultivating, they weeded, planting hope stalk by stalk in the field, waiting for them to flower and bear fruit. The fertilizer that cultivated this hope was sweat and blood.</p>
<p>Again, it didn't rain, and the river water quickly dried up.</p>
<p>Sorrow immediately climbed onto everyone's face, every heart. Old people began to sigh, saying it was "Heaven's taking"; the tempers of the women were also particularly irritable, the sound of beating and scolding children overflowed in front of every house; the children seemed to cry more, love to bite and make noise more. The air in the village, in these few days, has had a tense change. The first thing the farmers did when they got up early in the morning was to look at the sky, but the sky had no intention of rain at all. A white cloud floated from the western horizon, floated over, and slowly fell to the eastern mountain top, what was left was still an endless blue sky.</p>
<p>What the farmers were expecting were black clouds, big ones, black clouds that men of elegance couldn't make poems from, but there were none.</p>
<p>The rice seedlings in the field turned yellower and drier day by day. The farmers carefully ran to the edge of the field, carefully examining the leaves, stems, and roots, looking for a trace of green. As long as it could rain a little before the green color had completely faded, yes, as long as it could rain a little enough to soak them, then there would still be hope of recovery.</p>
<p>As long as the rice seedlings didn't die one day, the hearts of the farmers also didn't die one day.</p>
<p>"Ten days, if it could rain in the next ten days..." But nine days, eight days, ten days, six days, how fast the days were!</p>
<p>The sighs of the old people, the women beating their children, the children crying and making noise, became more and more vigorous. "In the first year of Xuantong, the rice fields were scorched to death, what will happen this year?" Everyone thought this way.</p>
<p>I don't know when the end of this film will be, I also don't know what the result will be. I only remember that its title is called "Nostalgia."</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Current State of Public Health Work at the Shanhai Gongxue Tuan (Part 1) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Yi</p>
<p>1.  Establishment of the Health Office</p>
<p>The Shanhai Gongxue Tuan (Shanhai Work-Study Group) was established in the autumn of 1932. Its main purpose was to test the most economical and accessible educational methods based on the theory of "life is education," in order to expand educational opportunities under the current impoverished social conditions. Health education is a major goal in life education. From its inception, the group received assistance from the Department of Public Health of the National Shanghai Medical College, including guidance in planning, donation of medicines, and the establishment of the foundation for public health work. In the spring of 1933, the Shanghai YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association) sent specialists to rural areas to engage in women's education and to take charge of public health work, and the Gongxue Tuan's health activities were carried out in cooperation with them. Unexpectedly, after autumn, the YWCA's health workers left. Driven by necessity, the Gongxue Tuan selected a female assistant to go to the Gaoqiao Health Office of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to receive preliminary public health training. It was not until the end of June 1934 that the assistant returned to the group, organized the health office, and determined the minimum necessary funding, that the health work could proceed independently. Time flies, and now it has been exactly one year. Although there are no significant achievements in various activities, the experiences in this rural health work where both people and resources are scarce may serve as a reference for comrades in other places.</p>
<p>2.  Establishment of Health Beliefs</p>
<p>In rural public health work, the ideological obstacles encountered are as serious as the problems of funding and personnel. These obstacles include not only the difficult-to-break prejudices and superstitions of farmers, but also the traditional concepts and extreme views held by educators, which are also not easy to change immediately. Over the past year, whenever we had the opportunity, we did not miss the chance to exchange ideas. The methods used are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>A. Public Discussion: The assistants, little teachers, and participants in various activities of the Gongxue Tuan must have a gathering for discussion every Sunday to learn from each other. When health workers encounter differences in understanding or difficulties in their work, they must take this opportunity to raise concrete issues that stimulate thinking, discuss them openly, and seek a conclusion.</p>
<p>B. Regular Lectures: For children's Gongxue Tuan, youth Gongxue Tuan, and women's classes (organized by the YWCA), wherever people can gather on time to receive health lectures, health workers, with their consent, will schedule time to give lectures to awaken health beliefs and promote health work.</p>
<p>C. Free Conversation: The Gongxue Tuan originally regarded "society as school." On rice fields, field paths, tea gardens, and in treatment rooms, we engage in free conversations with farmers, farm women, and patients based on the current situation, instilling health knowledge and correcting traditional concepts.</p>
<p>D. Written Publicity: Health work or problems that are persistent and widespread are written into text and published in the Gongxue Tuan Weekly, the Life Education Bi-monthly, the Chinese Education Circle, and books published by the Gongxue Tuan.</p>
<p>3.  Health Check-ups and Correction of Deficiencies</p>
<p>Health check-ups of the members are the starting point for implementing health work. After the establishment of the health office, registers and check-up forms were prepared, and check-ups were conducted at various Gongxue Tuan locations. However, due to the limited capacity of the staff, the check-ups could not be fully implemented according to the standards. Moreover, we dare not be certain whether the check-up results are completely reliable. The check-up results are copied below:</p>
<p>Trachoma: 72.3%</p>
<p>Vision: 13.6%</p>
<p>Teeth: 15.5%</p>
<p>Nutrition: 5.6%</p>
<p>Skin disease: 43.1%</p>
<p>Hearing: 11.1%</p>
<p>Tonsils: 2.2%</p>
<p>The Gongxue Tuan is spread across six major villages. It is impossible for the health office staff alone to correct all the deficiencies. The remedy is to select members from each Gongxue Tuan to form first-aid teams, who come to the health office every day to learn how to correct mild trachoma and skin diseases. After they are proficient, they carry out correction work and keep medicine kits in each Gongxue Tuan. The health office staff spends half a day each day going to various places to provide assistance in turn and solve difficulties. Those with more serious deficiencies are still concentrated in the health office for individual correction. Vision, hearing, and teeth have not been remedied yet due to limited capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Phenomena of Urine <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>——Medical Story Two——</p>
<p>Most of the waste products produced by the tiny tissue cells in the human body circulate throughout the body with the blood and lymph. On the way, most of these wastes pass through the kidneys, which are specifically responsible for extracting waste products from the blood. The kidneys filter the waste products from the blood, mix them with a thin liquid, and transport them to the bladder, which is specially designed to receive and accumulate these wastes. Then, from this organ, they are discharged from the body at any time under the conscious control of the brain's center. The liquid discharged from the body is what we call urine.</p>
<p>Urine is continuously and intermittently fed from the kidneys into the bladder, at a speed of about one drop of urine every thirty seconds from each kidney. This is not conjecture, but something doctors have seen with their own eyes. Doctors insert a sophisticated endoscope into the bladder and can see the ends of the two ureters. They also insert fine hollow rubber tubes into these two ends to separately receive the urine drops coming from each kidney. The rubber tubes are pulled out and connected to glass tubes, so that the state and speed of the urine drops can be seen.</p>
<p>Urine contains urate salts, and these urate salts are what give urine its slightly yellow color. If there is too much urate salt in the urine, the bladder will be stimulated, and people will feel uncomfortable, or even get sick. The bladder is like a reservoir, gradually collecting urine. When the volume of urine reaches a certain level, that is, when the bladder cannot hold any more urine, or when the irritation of an overly concentrated urate solution creates an unnatural sense of fullness, the voluntary muscles of the urethra relax and allow urine to flow out of the body. People who drink too little water often have their bladders constantly irritated by excessive urate salt in their urine, resulting in frequent and short urination. Therefore, the number of times one urinates is not necessarily directly proportional to the amount of water one drinks.</p>
<p>Using urine to examine the health of the body has a long history. In many picture galleries of the Forbidden City, we can see paintings of doctors examining urine by famous old Dutch painters. Gerard Don's "Liebeskranker Mädchen" in Buckingham Palace and Teniers' "Site Arzte" in the Brussels Palace are the most moving works. In the paintings, a sick woman sits while a doctor holds a glass bottle filled with urine, carefully examining it against the sunlight, with a strangely solemn expression. The color, luster, and sediment of the urine are the materials used by those clever doctors to diagnose symptoms. It is said that in the early days of medical progress in the United States, there was a diagnostic method of pouring urine on fire to determine the disease based on the color change of the flame. Extinguished flames indicated a very dangerous disease; blue flames indicated that death was imminent; and green flames indicated a biliary disease. An English doctor named Thomas Willis was the first to discover that the urine of diabetics had a sweet taste.</p>
<p>In 1829, the British physician Richard Bright discovered coagulated albumin in the urine of patients with edema. He discovered this when he heated the patient's urine in a tin spoon over a candle flame. This method is still common today, except that a glass test tube is used instead of a tin spoon.</p>
<p>The presence of protein in the urine is not necessarily evidence of kidney disease. Sometimes healthy people have protein in their urine but show no signs of kidney disease. Patients with pneumonia or tonsillitis also often have protein in their urine. Therefore, in addition to examining urine, a careful doctor must examine the whole body.</p>
<p>The formation of crystals in the kidneys or bladder is the same as the formation of crystals in any part of the body. The conditions for the formation of these crystals are: a cavity containing liquid; the liquid contains dissolved salts; a foreign object enters the cavity; and the salts in the liquid accumulate around the object. The so-called foreign objects are bacteria and mucus fragments that are caused by bacterial infections of the epithelial surface. If the crystals are small, they descend from the kidneys along the ureters, or from the bladder along the urethra, causing colic that is even more painful than labor pains.</p>
<p>The discovery of sediment in the urine often surprises patients; in fact, this sediment is mostly made up of phosphate or urate salt accumulations, which is a common phenomenon. If the sediment is blood or pus, that indicates a real illness. A prominent symptom of certain toxic cancers is blood in the urine, and tuberculosis can affect the kidneys and bladder. Infections in various parts of the body can cause pus in the kidneys or renal pelvis. It should be known that urine not only carries the traces of various parts of the urinary tract, thus reflecting the condition of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, but is also the ultimate product of assimilation and metabolism, which can reflect the overall health status.</p>

<p>— Ying Yongfeng</p>
<p>(1) Newborn Infants: Before and after breastfeeding, the oral cavity and the mother's nipples should be gently wiped with 3% boric acid solution (mild) using sterile gauze wrapped around the fingertip.</p>
<p>(2) Children During the Period of Tooth Eruption (6 to 12 years old): Parents should pay special attention to consulting a dentist to examine and correct any irregularities.</p>
<p>(3) Children Should Regularly Eat Foods Rich in Calcium Salts (such as vegetables, eggs, etc.)</p>
<p>(4) Children's teeth should have the opportunity to chew harder foods and should not be constantly fed soft foods.</p>
<p>(5) Once a tooth has caries (i.e., cavities), it spreads very quickly. Acute caries can destroy more than half of the tooth within six weeks, so as soon as it starts (darkening), it should be treated by a dentist.</p>
<p>(6) Whether to fill or extract a tooth should be decided by the dentist.</p>
<p>(7) Tooth filling requires at least several follow-up visits.</p>
<p>(8) When extracting a tooth, one should have confidence, follow the dentist's instructions, and not be afraid or panic!</p>
<p>(9) After tooth extraction, the wound must be protected, the mouth rinsed clean, and the fingers must not touch the wound. Avoid exertion, and do not eat stimulating foods. Rest is recommended, and a follow-up visit to the dentist is required the next day.</p>
<p>(10) If a gold crown is damaged, it should be removed immediately and never used again.</p>
<p>(11) You should see a dentist for check-ups and teeth cleaning at least twice a year.</p>

<p>(59) Acute Articular Rheumatism (in Chinese)</p>
<p>(Acute Articular Rheumatism) (English)</p>
<p>(Q) Besides endocarditis, what other complications of the heart occur with acute articular rheumatism?</p>
<p>(A) There are also pericarditis and myocarditis, etc. If the entire heart suffers complications, it is called pancarditis.</p>
<p>(Q) If a patient develops cardiac complications, are the symptoms of the joints severe?</p>
<p>(A) Patients who develop cardiac complications usually have mild rheumatic symptoms in their joints. This is because patients with mild symptoms are most likely to get out of bed and exert themselves, resulting in palpitations and difficulty breathing. At this time, the heart is damaged.</p>
<p>(Q) Can acute articular rheumatism also affect the peritoneum or pleura, and mucous membranes in the body?</p>
<p>(A) Yes, it can. If the peritoneum is affected, peritonitis develops; if the pleura is affected, pleurisy develops. These are mostly secondary to pericarditis. As for mucous membranes, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the throat, stomach, and intestines often occurs.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the skin symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) When this disease occurs, the skin is mostly pale, sometimes anemic. There is a lot of sweating, resulting in miliary rash and erythema nodosum. In addition, there may also be urticaria (hemorrhagic).</p>
<p>(Q) What are the muscle symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) Muscle atrophy and muscle paralysis may occur. These conditions often occur in muscles near the affected joints.</p>
<p>(Q) How does acute articular rheumatism affect the nervous system?</p>
<p>(A) The symptoms of the nervous system include cerebral rheumatism, Sydenham's chorea, acute psychosis, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What is called cerebral rheumatism?</p>
<p>(A) This symptom is rare. The patient may experience headache, confusion, and delirium. At this time, the body temperature rises very high, sometimes reaching 34 degrees Celsius, which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>(Q) What is Sydenham's chorea?</p>
<p>(A) It is secondary to joint disease, and is most common in children. It is also often accompanied by endocarditis.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens when acute psychosis occurs?</p>
<p>(A) Patients mostly develop depression or mental confusion, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) Acute articular rheumatism has very many symptoms. In addition to the many organs mentioned above, can other organs be affected?</p>
<p>(A) When the lungs are affected, pneumonia occurs; when the kidneys are affected, nephritis occurs, both of which are dangerous symptoms.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes occur in the patient's spleen?</p>
<p>(A) The spleen does not swell as much as in other acute infectious diseases, so it can be considered that there are no significant changes.</p>

<p>b.  The Problem of Patrons: The transmission of the virus does not differentiate between genders. Therefore, the examination of patrons is an inherent part of the matter. In some places in Germany, this has already been implemented, and it can serve as a model for us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to examining both sexes for the presence of viruses, the state should also promote general prevention and hygiene, such as establishing preventive conditions for brothels (implementation of genital cleaning, use of condoms, etc.) and making safety preparations.</p>
<p>c.  Natural Restraint</p>
<p>This still means using rational guidance to achieve the purpose of prevention. For example, disseminating sex education and general health knowledge, lecturing on the harms of venereal diseases, informing people of the moral or religious condemnation and sanctions to which the disease is subject, and providing guidance on prevention before illness and treatment after illness. This will make those who are not yet infected aware of the danger and stay away from brothels, and make those who are already infected seek medical treatment and avoid the harm of repeated transmission. This approach has been successfully implemented in Europe and the United States, such as the establishment of brothel visits and preventive talks in the United States, Germany, and France. It is said that there are more than 500 such institutions in Paris alone. Therefore, if the government, charitable organizations, schools, and individuals in our country can work together with one heart and promote this work, I believe that the results will be very impressive. Gentlemen of our country, why not join in?</p>
<p>(B) Individual Prevention: Narrowly defined individual prevention is not only a plan to benefit oneself, but also to benefit others. I will briefly describe it.</p>
<p>a.  Mechanical Prevention: This is to cut off direct contact between the sexual organs of both sexes, which is also the meaning of isolation prevention. The method is to use a bag made of fish bladder or rubber (Condom) – commonly known as a condom – which is placed on the penis before sexual intercourse to prevent the transmission of the virus. The points to note are: (1) The bag must not have any tears or small holes. (2) The elasticity of the bag should be strong and suitable. (3) It must be fresh. Also, even with the use of the bag, failures still occur due to finger contact during removal and the transmission of sensation from the perineum during intercourse.</p>
<p>b.  Drug Prevention: Such as the use of calomel and mercuric oxycyanide, either as an ointment or as a paste, applied before and after the event. In addition, potassium permanganate solution is used for washing. However, there are often cases of failure because the disinfectant cannot completely kill the bacteria.</p>
<p>c.  Combined Use of Mechanical and Drug Methods</p>
<p>This is the combined implementation of the two methods listed above, which is the most ideal.</p>
<p>Finally, the author would like to state that the implementation of individual prevention methods is only a last resort and should not be taken as a license for licentiousness once prevention is possible. — (End of Part 1)</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(52) Mastoiditis</p>
<p>Mastoiditis mostly occurs secondarily to acute or chronic suppurative otitis media. Primary mastoiditis is rare. The symptoms it produces are easy to identify: swelling and redness occur in the mastoid process (i.e., behind the auricle). Sometimes the swelling can spread to the temporal and zygomatic regions, which often causes swelling of the eyelids. If you press or tap the mastoid process with your fingers, the patient feels very pain. When the disease is severe, even a light press on the area causes unbearable pain. The posterosuperior wall of the external auditory canal gradually bulges, and the ear discharge also becomes profuse. Systemic symptoms include fever, irritability, and restless sleep, etc. If a subperiosteal abscess forms in the mastoid fossa area and has not yet perforated, a significant fluctuation can be felt behind the auricle. The auricle also stands out away from the head due to the swelling of the skin behind the ear, which is a characteristic of this disease (see attached image).</p>
<p>If the pathological changes of this disease continue, the bone wall of the mastoid process will collapse and perforate outward, or invade inward. There are approximately five perforation sites, namely: (1) the mastoid fossa area – most common; (2) the posterior wall of the external auditory canal – more common; (3) the inner wall of the tip of the mastoid process – next most common; (4) the root of the zygomatic process – next most common; (5) perforation into the cranial cavity or labyrinth – less common. The best way to prevent mastoiditis is to treat otitis media immediately when suffering from acute or chronic suppurative otitis media to avoid the spread of the disease to the mastoid process and the development of bone lesions. If you feel swelling and pressure pain behind the auricle, you should know that inflammation has already spread to the mastoid process. At this time, if anti-inflammatory methods are used carefully, the inflammation and swelling can mostly subside. If the period is prolonged and not treated, or if the patient is weak and lacks resistance, an abscess will inevitably form. At this time, surgery is the best strategy, otherwise all kinds of dangers will arise, eventually leading to an irreversible situation. Please pay close attention. In order to arouse the interest of the readers, I will give a brief description of a case and publish two photos of the patient's appearance for reference.</p>
<p>Patient: Zou, male, 6 years old</p>
<p>Past history: According to the record, he started to have pus discharge from his right ear in May of last year due to measles (rubella).</p>
<p>He only sought treatment from a traditional Chinese doctor in May of this year. Soon after, swelling, pain, and fever started to occur in the lower part of the back of his right ear. After about two weeks, the pus discharge from his ear became more severe, and the patient became irritable and restless at night. After a few more days, the pus discharge suddenly decreased, while the swelling in the area increased. It even spread to the right eyelid. Now the swelling in the lower part of the back of the ear is even worse, and the pus discharge from the ear is also greater, like a spring. However, the swelling of the eyelid has subsided, and his appetite is still good.</p>

<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>For other types of external hemorrhoids, if the pain is severe, the best treatment is to inject a local anesthetic and then cut them off. This will result in complete healing in a few days, which is much better than the slow treatment with ointments.</p>
<p>Internal hemorrhoids are dilated varicose veins located one or two inches above the anus. Their outer skin is the mucous membrane of the large intestine, which is not the same as the external skin. Internal hemorrhoids vary in size, from the size of a broad bean to the size of a small walnut. There are many causes of hemorrhoids, but the most important are long-term constipation, cirrhosis of the liver, pregnancy, tumors in the pelvis, and any condition that prevents blood from flowing back from the abdomen can cause hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Mild internal hemorrhoids have no pain except for slight pain during bowel movements, but large internal hemorrhoids can sometimes cause unbearable pain to the patient. Large internal hemorrhoids also often prolapse after bowel movements and are difficult to return to their original position. Such daily suffering can be considered a great misfortune for mankind. Internal hemorrhoids are also often cut by hard stools, causing bleeding of varying degrees.</p>
<p>There are three methods for treating hemorrhoids. The first is methods other than surgery. To reduce pain, the first thing to pay attention to is to prevent constipation. If constipation occurs, hemorrhoids will easily grow larger and bowel movements will be very painful. It is beneficial for patients to inject three or four spoonfuls of oil (such as olive oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, mineral oil, etc.) into the anus every night. The oil can soften the stool and also lubricate it, so that the hemorrhoids are not injured, and bleeding and pain can be mostly eliminated. Taking mineral oil orally three times a day will make the lubricating effect even better.</p>
<p>If the hemorrhoids prolapse during bowel movements and are painful and difficult to return, you can first wash the hemorrhoids with hot water, and then apply ointment to make it easier to return them to their original position. If the hemorrhoids are painful, you can apply pain-relieving ointment to the hemorrhoids. Using hemorrhoid suppositories is also helpful. If the first method does not have a fully effective and long-lasting effect, the following methods should be adopted:</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 4. Digestive Organs (Continued)</p>
<p>In addition to intestinal tuberculosis, tuberculous changes also occur in many other parts of the digestive organs. In severe pulmonary tuberculosis patients, tuberculous ulcers can occur in the tongue, soft palate, pharynx, tonsils, etc. These complications are mostly associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, tuberculosis of the peritoneum is also very common; it is mostly combined with intestinal tuberculosis. Fistulas and abscesses in the rectum are also mostly of a tuberculous nature. Tuberculous ulcers of the stomach are relatively rare. Apart from proof from autopsy, they are clinically imperceptible.</p>
<p>Section 5. Respiratory Organs Other Than the Lungs—Laryngeal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Parts of the respiratory organs other than the lungs are also easily affected. Among these, the most common one is undoubtedly "laryngeal tuberculosis"! It is mostly caused by the upward invasion of the patient's sputum. It is commonly seen in severe cases of open pulmonary tuberculosis, and both exudative and proliferative forms are possible. According to clinical findings, it accounts for about 25 percent, but pathological examination reports show more than this number. Its initial site of occurrence is mostly the posterior wall of the larynx and the vocal cords, and the laryngeal cartilage is also very commonly affected. In addition to the secondary type mentioned above, primary laryngeal tuberculosis is not completely impossible, and there are clinical examples that can be cited, but it is far less common than the former! The occurrence of lupus in the larynx is also not uncommon. However, it is caused entirely by the invasion of lupus from the face and has nothing to do with pulmonary tuberculosis. Moreover, its course is completely different, and the pathological changes are also different, so it will not be discussed here.</p>

<h3 id="e189">The Problem of Advertisements Insulting Women <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Perhaps it stems from a natural love of beauty, or perhaps it originates from the inferior nature of playing with women. An unnatural "worship of women" has long prevailed among humans. This unnatural "worship of women" manifests in general social phenomena, seemingly praising women, yet also seemingly insulting them. For example, Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" and "Song of the Pipa" express a "cherishing jade and fragrant" sentiment with descriptions like "A backward glance, a charming smile, a hundred graces are born; the beauties of the six palaces pale in color" and "We are both people fallen to the ends of the earth; why must we have known each other before?" On the other hand, they heap many sins upon women with phrases like "The Han emperor prized beauty and thought of overthrowing kingdoms" and "The young masters of the Five Mausoleums vied to offer bolts of silk."</p>
<p>In reality, this situation outwardly carries the pretense of "worshipping women," while its essence is the "sexual mania" of men coupled with a psychology of insult. This sexual mania and insulting psychology have obviously become increasingly intense due to the disparity in economic status between men and women. This is especially prevalent in this declining society of twilight years, where many citizens, hoping to forget the cruel reality, flock to this path to find their new world. Film fans are busy writing letters to movie stars, and courtesans are envied and obsessed over by many. It is within this unnatural "worship of women" that this trend is sweeping through the times.</p>
<p>This weakness in social psychology has been recognized by those with a "business eye," and they use it as a tool to attract customers. On a small scale, things like grain seeds are branded with "star trademarks," and on a large scale, there are "innovative" live advertisements: fashion exhibitions, opening ceremony flower vases, female salespersons, etc., all fall into this category. Although this attitude has a fully "flattering" and insulting nature, we have a portion of women who actually accept it with equanimity, even taking pride in it, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Association, noting that commercial firms and factories in various places use women's photos in advertisements that not only intentionally defile women but also feature bizarre shapes and shameful postures, which greatly affect social customs, has specifically requested the provincial authorities to forward a request to the central competent authorities to issue a general order to ban them. This is undoubtedly a move to address a contemporary ill. However, we believe that while banning is a method of curbing, this incident of insulting women arises from an environment that already has the habit of insulting women. Its fundamental elimination lies not only in banning "bizarre" advertisements but also in how to eradicate various "bizarre" facts that insult women. The unnatural "worship of women" in society is the overall insult to women.</p>

<p>— Tingyi</p>
<p>The banners advertising Yanshou Hall's tenth-anniversary grand sale flew all over the broad streets. Villagers who recognized a few large characters read them aloud: "Publicly slaughtering sika deer, various ginseng, bird's nest, and white fungus at greatly reduced prices."</p>
<p>"Damn!" a companion continued, "It's hard enough to get porridge these days; ginseng and bird's nest, who would come to the door for that!"</p>
<p>"There are still plenty of rich people in the city! It's us poor people who are pawning everything, and even the rice stores are about to close!" the person reading the advertisement lamented.</p>
<p>Two children dressed as clowns walked past them, the three large characters "Yanshou Hall" printed in bright red on their yellow vests, slowly walking forward while beating a large drum.</p>
<p>This strange advertising technique seemed to arouse the interest of this group of people. "There are also free gifts, maybe we can bring something back empty-handed." Thinking this, their footsteps followed the two children forward.</p>
<p>Yanshou Hall is the county's unparalleled large pharmacy with two storefronts. Doctors always instruct patients with serious illnesses to go to Yanshou Hall, as if the medicinal materials there are the only genuine ones. Every winter, during the ×th-anniversary grand sale, Yanshou Hall's business can exceed that of a southern goods store. When large customers come to the door, Manager Song personally serves tea and offers cigarettes, and this kind of harmonious reception is said to double the business of the past three seasons.</p>
<p>However, this prosperity, like a time of peace, has</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>passed.</p>
<p>The grand sales of various guilds are no longer effective. With famine and war, villagers naturally have a hard time even getting porridge, and city people are also outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Doing the same good business as in previous years for luxuries like wheat, bird's nest, and white fungus is simply a dream.</p>
<p>Yanshou Hall has closed one storefront, renting it to a foreign general merchandise store that plays Western music all day long. When Mr. Song can't stand the cold and quiet store, he sits with his water pipe and wanders over to their store to chat.</p>
<p>Although the Western orchestra plays with all its might, it is rare for a customer to come in and make a purchase for one or two mao. When the two managers start talking, they always shake their heads and sigh.</p>
<p>"Even these daily necessities have no buyers, so your business is naturally even more deserted." The general merchandise store manager suddenly felt his tone was too heavy, so he deliberately chuckled and continued, "Your store's business is always not bad, right?"</p>
<p>"The market is depressed, but patients always need to see a doctor and take medicine, right?" Mr. Song shouted one day, pounding the table.</p>
<p>That evening, he invited the shareholders to a secret meeting.</p>
<p>"The year is really too bad!" he began, "The daily necessities in the Jinghuo store next door have no business, but I think..." He deliberately paused, using his sharp gaze to scan the faces of each shareholder, and then continued, "I think, people still get sick, and patients still need to see a doctor and take medicine. As long as we really have a big sale and implement a low-profit policy, it's reasonable to be able to cover expenses every day!"</p>
<p>"The year is really too bad!" one shareholder said, expressing no opinion.</p>
<p>"We should think of a way..."</p>
<p>"Yes." Mr. Song hurriedly took over another shareholder's tone, "This year is the twentieth anniversary. I remember we did over ten thousand in business in the tenth anniversary, slaughtering a sika deer. This year, I think..."</p>
<p>"I have a way." Mr. Song deliberately lowered his voice, "I can find a way to rent one to make a show. As long as we're doing business, what does it matter if we slaughter it or not?"</p>
<p>Yanshou Hall made money in the past. Now, as long as the shareholders don't add capital, Mr. Song's idea will be implemented.</p>
<p>A light arch was erected outside the door, and the Western orchestra from the Jinghuo store came to sit in their store. A sika deer, as big as a dog, hung with colored nets, burning musk, was placed in the large patio, and people outside crowded around like watching a play.</p>
<p>"What sika deer, it's smaller than a dog!" a laugh came from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Hmph! There are plenty of rich people in the city. Look, there are plenty of people watching the fun!" the previous villager said, peeking from behind.</p>
<p>"Mind your own business!" the advertisement reader said, "Go to the teahouse and see the village head before you talk. Wanting to buy some tonics to be filial to your mother in such a famine!"</p>

<p>— Jixiang</p>
<p>At the dead of night, the wind sprays like a fountain on the streets of the dead metropolis—although it is already the hot season; however, in the dark, unfathomably deep night, when most people are seeking peace in rest that can only be found in dreams, when a small number of people are lurking in the world of darkness, trying to exchange violence and courage for tomorrow's bread, or planning to digest their overfed stomachs in gilded anesthetics, even in the ambiguous South where coconuts grow, the wind still carries a kind of power—the power to make the tiny souls wandering in the night tremble like lonely sailboats in the sea!</p>
<p>The night is so quiet, so long. The world stretches out blackly and vast before one's eyes. The streets are obviously tired and have lost their color; and people are still wandering the desolate streets of the night, being mindful of every passerby, every patrolman, and every dark corner that can be used to close their eyes and lean against. It has been a full three or four days and nights, losing their minds, losing their reason, losing their intentions, and also losing the bread crust that serves as the raw material for life; and so, they begin to stand blankly in the desolate and stingy street, looking at the passing pedestrians, the stores, the clothing, and the food with strange, curious, and also seemingly incomprehensible eyes (these are all tightly kept in the glass windows, as a boast to the creatures who have fallen from the high tower of life); an uncontrollable flame of hunger, like swallowing a person's heart, rises up, but they still chase after the people on the road like wandering souls, begging, describing their suffering and hunger in the most detailed sentences, asking for everyone's slightest giving. The punishment of hunger is unbearable, and the power of hunger is so great that there is no way to restrain it; just as a flood drives the turbine of a generator, hunger also drives the courage of human life; say that begging is a thousand kinds of shame, if that is really the case, then from humans to other creatures, in the moment when they are about to be burned and destroyed by the flames of hunger, there is reason to endure this unspeakable abuse and shame—can it not be said that "wanting to live" is by far the greatest and most sufficient irreversible reason?</p>
<p>The streets are so lively; but people's hearts are still so desolate; in the god of boasting, they have once nobly thrown hatred and contempt upon the beggars. Thus, the young souls of beggars, burned by the flames of hunger, endure shame day and night, endure everything that is most unbearable, telling and begging, and the giving they receive is still not the continuation of life, but on the contrary, it is the collection and accumulation of countless shames. This world is truly strange.</p>
<p>(The night is too deep to fathom, and the world seems to have fallen into the night. At this time, how difficult it must be for people to live; people have to beg the world for pity, to demand, to tell; however, in a season of much wind and rain, even this has lost its effect.</p>
<p>Over the years, the streets are still the streets; but how many more beggars, tortured by hunger, have been added: lean men who are still young, white-haired old women standing and shivering, are their fates destined to endure a large amount of shame? However, think about it! In some easier past times, who has not seen days like goose down?</p>
<p>And now, it is necessary every day, in every corner of the street, to exchange shame and the compassion of others for terrible food.)</p>
<p>Beggars have learned greater endurance and more terrible wandering. The sound made by the "Lotus Fall" clappers is not laughter, but a begging to the world!</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Southern Country in June <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>The hot sun scorches the narrow and noisy streets, the green bricks paved on the streets, the smooth surface once trod by countless wanderers, wearily reflects the white sunlight, people want to doze off, even if they are running on the road, they have to squint and close their eyes, as if afraid that the dazzling sun will devour them. However, everyone is dizzy, and the sweat that keeps dripping down is also sticky.</p>
<p>The wind blowing from the sea is depressing, as if it wants to dye the world with this stuffy atmosphere, as if it is the wind blowing from the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Leaning against the railing on the pier formed by earth and cement, one can see the vast sea.</p>
<p>Here, there is the flag of the authority of the Empire, flying on the huge warship, and the sound it reveals seems to be proudly saying: "Macau, the coast rich in resources." Here are nothing but white devils, everything white, as if in the violent storm belt, the surging waves, everything wants to estimate, cowardly like a huge sleeping lion, China.</p>
<p>The emerald green sea reflects the white sunlight, and the sea is covered with countless white salutes, terrible swords and knives, shining, constantly undulating, just arranging a large team of iron-faced soldiers, to threaten, deceive, and ridicule the innocent Chinese, everything will be swept into the cannibalistic group.</p>
<p>However, the wind of June blows through everything in the southern country, as if countless leisurely people want to doze off, floating and greedily wandering. This is exactly showing that they are about to be burned to death by the sun, scattered, lazy, a style inherited from their ancestors, how would they know that the leisurely world has reached its end, even if the high-sounding tune of patriotism ripples throughout their unfortunate hometown, they may wearily say: "The weather is really annoying, who has the time to care about his mother's end or the future?" So, they bury their dizzy heads in the place filled with the light of money and the gambling den that harbors the smell of killing, from day to night, as if a rolling river of great hemp, they spend their declining lives without rest, or their thin, dry bodies collapse in the black-scented smoking room on a high pillow, where they cannot see the sun, cannot see the winds and clouds of the country, where they only "luo—luo" suck opium, from day to night, just burying their dying bodies in this sad circle, or using their young, healthy bodies, lost in the arms of plump women, the beautiful daughters of the southern country, they will open their faces smeared with powder, their lips, to bewilder the depressed youths of the end of the world, they are drunk in this circle, perhaps not feeling the annoyance of June; however, before the scent of perfume exuding from there has dissipated, they quietly throw their rotten and diseased bodies into the bottomless abyss in the dark night.</p>
<p>That unclear, blurred picture makes people feel that besides the sticky atmosphere, there is only madness, bewilderment, wandering, or the dancing floor of intoxication, where the soothing melody is playing, and the men and women who have forgotten the winds and clouds of the world are tightly hugging and dancing. Everything is being buried in the black seawater.</p>
<p>The southern country in June, under the banner of the imperialists, is full of blurred shadows, and the sticky, charming wind is rippling. Ruizhi</p>
<h3 id="e193">Oil Shop (Part 1) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ruizhi</p>
<p>Over the past ten years or so, Mahu Town has clearly changed its appearance. In the past, the main street was more prosperous than even the county seat. People from the surrounding villages all gathered here to buy and sell things. There were various kinds of shops, and the streets were crowded with people every day. If it was a holiday or festival, it was simply as lively as a temple fair. But now, the scene is different. Seven or eight out of ten shops, both large and small, on the main street have closed their doors, and the streets are quiet all day long. Sometimes there is hardly a single person in sight.</p>
<p>Old Zhou's oil shop, although a small shop hidden in a corner of the main street, is well known by the people of the town and the surrounding villages. Everyone knows that Old Zhou's oil shop is the one with the best business. This oil shop was passed down from Old Zhou's great-great-grandfather, and it is considered an old business in this town. But now, the daily income has fallen from several tens of dollars to less than ten diào. This makes Old Zhou frown from time to time, worried that this ancestral shop will be closed down in his hands.</p>
<p>"It is true that the years are bad, but does that mean that people don't even need to eat oil, don't need to light fires, and don't need to worship the lords and Buddhas?"</p>
<p>He is always concerned about this ancestral oil shop, thinking and worrying about it. He often asks himself, "Will it really close down?" But this is of no use. The worsening situation before his eyes is alarming to him. However, he sometimes turns his thinking around:</p>
<p>"The years are really too bad. Early droughts and floods have left no way out. In this situation, even rice stores have no business, let alone my oil shop. People don't even have food to eat, so how can anyone afford to buy oil?"</p>

<p>— Nan</p>
<p>He spent five years of hard labor in the icy and snowy life of cattle and horses. The years of coldness and sorrow increased his extraordinary and unyielding will. In exile, the general became friends with an elderly Polish sociologist companion. In his spare time, he diligently studied academic theories. After five years, the general had become a true believer in democracy. He hurried back to his hometown and continued his revolutionary work without slackening. However, under the strict surveillance of the Tsarist Russian police, he had no fixed residence, moving several times a day. The atmosphere was tense, and he could not eat or sleep in peace. At this time, the general began to conduct secret organizations among Polish workers, as he had confirmed that workers were the only weapon against Tsarist Russia. He secretly published a workers' daily newspaper, with the general always personally writing articles, detailing the responsibilities of Polish workers, indicating patriotic justice, and discussing political, economic, and social issues. The number of workers and young students who returned to him increased daily. After more than a year, the general formed a strong Polish Socialist Party, with members all over the country, with the sole aim of seeking Polish independence. Not long after its establishment, the police discovered his plot. The general was arrested again, but thanks to the power of the party members, he repeatedly escaped after being arrested. In the end, he had no choice but to flee abroad. At that time, the general had been engaged in revolutionary work for nearly twenty years, encountering hardships and repeated failures, but he never succumbed to the tyranny of Tsarist Russia. The general always said to people that he would fight for Poland to the end, until the last drop of blood. How magnificent! He also said that defeat without surrender is called victory, and victory with rest and enjoyment is called defeat. The general's life was based on these few words, which are enough to encompass it.</p>
<p>The general knew that the freedom of Poland could only be achieved by relying on military force, so he began to plan a secret organization of volunteer army. This was indeed a most difficult task. Under layers of shackles and the tyranny of Tsarist Russia, trying to form a military group with bare hands, even his own people recognized that this move would only lead to sacrifice and would be of no use. The general educated them, explained to them, and at the same time actively organized them, and finally formed the famous Polish volunteer army of later days, which won Polish freedom. The general foresaw that the European war would inevitably break out, and he trained this volunteer army even more diligently, day after day. When the war drums sounded in 1914, the general led this volunteer army into battle and won repeated victories. The general's reputation began to grow. Later, the German and Austrian coalition forces wanted to use his army, but the general resolutely refused. The German army designed to disarm his army, and the officers were sent to various German forts for imprisonment. The general was also arrested and imprisoned in the army prison of the Hamburg fortress.</p>
<p>When the war ended and the German revolution took place, the general was released and returned to Warsaw amidst the cheers of the people of the country. At that time, although Poland had achieved freedom and independence as a result of the general's struggle, everything was chaotic, political parties were divided, mistrusting and hating each other, there was no government, no military police, no funds, and everything was unorganized. The general was determined to rectify domestic affairs, first organizing the government and the parliament, stipulating that all nationals over the age of twenty-one, regardless of gender or religion, had the right to vote. The general was elected as the head of state by the parliament and was appointed as the Grand Marshal, commanding the national army.</p>

<p>The New Era's production, "Mr. Wang Spends the New Year," has been well-received and praised by the public. Therefore, the script for the third film, "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside," has undergone three months of in-depth research and discussion to ensure perfection. It is said that the naming has been successfully announced.</p>
<p>Tang Jie is focusing all his efforts on dividing the shots, and it can be said that every shot is the result of his painstaking effort. He hopes that "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" will become a representative work of the New Era.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" is a sound film, still starring the original cast of Tang Jie, Cao Xuesong, and Huang Naishuang. The preliminary script has been sent to Beijing for review, and filming will begin as soon as it is approved.</p>

<p>There are five pairs of brothers and sisters-in-law in "Big Family." The eldest brother, Wang Xianzai, and the eldest sister-in-law, Xuan Jinglin, are a perfect match, equal in talent and appearance. The second brother, Gong Jianong, seems like a completely honest person on the surface, but he has two wives, Huang Naishuang and Zhu Qiuhen, who often fight and bicker over jealousy, creating many funny situations. The third brother, Sun Min, and the third sister-in-law, Ye Qiuxin, look like bad people to anyone who sees them. But to be honest, they are actually very good people. Later, they separated from the family and were deceived by Wang Xianzai and Gong Jianong to come to Shanghai to do business in gold, which led to their bankruptcy and poverty. The fourth brother, Gao Zhanfei, and the fifth brother, Zhao Dan, are both single men. On New Year's Eve, when the five pairs of brothers made their New Year's greetings, everyone bowed with their wives, but the fourth and fifth brothers had no women, so they had to pair up and bow to their ancestors together. Later, the fourth brother, Gao Zhanfei, also married Gao Qianping. This left only Zhao Dan as a single man, but he was not upset. He knew he was still young and should study more during his youth. As a result, his brothers all went bankrupt, and only he lived in peace and prosperity. But they also realized that they should not be vain, greedy, or selfish, and that they should not have separated from the family and run to this hypocritical Shanghai. Alas! So they all went back to the countryside to work in rural areas.</p>
<p>After reading the interesting stories of the five brothers above, we can understand the excellent content of "Big Family." The actors here include almost all the stars of the Mingxing Film Company. Zhang Shichuan is the screenwriter and director.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Diantong's Two Directors: One Bold, One Detailed - Situ Huimin and Yuan Muzhi <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Situ Huimin, the director of "Goddess of Freedom," has a wide mouth and a square face, and he is always smiling. His eyes greet people. On the set, he wears a set of yellow khaki work clothes. He studied painting and worked as a set designer. He is also an expert in sound recording. Therefore, it is predicted that the visuals and sound recording of "Goddess of Freedom" will be a perfect achievement. In addition, he has great control over directing large-scale crowd scenes and is quite "bold."</p>
<p>As for Yuan Muzhi, the director of "Cityscape," is the most particular about acting in the theater world. Since the start of "Cityscape," he has cut off his curly hair and adopted a carefree attitude. He spends all day on set thinking carefully, paying attention to the setting and the position of the camera. He loves to joke with everyone. There is a piano in his room, and before going to bed and after getting up, he must play a few tunes. When filming, each shot is tried many times to ensure that the actors' performances are skilled. Although the actors secretly complain, he finds it particularly interesting. This must be his "detailed" style, and I think a satirical comedy requires this kind of effort.</p>
