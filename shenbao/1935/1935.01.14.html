<p>時評</p>
<h3>改革鹽政豈可再緩？　廷</h3>
<p>我國講究鹽政。起源甚古。惜良法久湮。積弊至深。廢清末葉。鹽務黑暗。至有「鹽糊塗」之俗稱、民國成立以來。因借欵擔保關係。不得不借助客卿。從事改良。近年鹽税收入。較前確有進步。顧鹽爲人民日用必需之品。食鹽徵税。卽財政學中所謂丁口税者之一種。其不合近代租税學原理。固爲職者所公認。而引岸專商制度。尤爲莫大之弊病。二十年五月。國民政府法院。有鑒於此。以迅雷不及掩耳之手段。通過新鹽法。開近代改革鹽政之先聲。新法規定在公布以後設鹽政改革委員會。直隷行政院。掌理關於本法之一切興革計劃。今去新法公布已三年有餘。而改革委員會始有於最近一週以内實行成立之議。甚望政府當局能懲前毖後排除困難。使此舉國屬望之新鹽法得早日完成其使命也。</p>
<p>據新鹽法第一條。改革鹽政必須遵循兩條大路。一曰就塲徵税。二曰自由買賣。此固我國歷來倡言改革鹽政者所主張。蓋就塲徵税則先税後鹽。一税</p>
<p>佳。壟斷之風。無從發生。且卽以國家之税收而論。自由貿易之後。鹽價必跌。銷鹽必暢。鹽税不必增高。而税收自旺。但我國自宋元以來。向行「産鹽有定塲銷鹽有定地運鹽有定商」之引票制。此種「定商。」操縱鹽業。久以特權階級自居。一聞改制將成。卽羣起運動。仗其雄厚之資本。作最後之挣扎。甚或危言聳聽。謂新法實行後政府將損失八九千萬元之固定舊税。以期分化行政與立法兩方之立塲。而其所恃爲世襲之護符者。則卽爲畸形發展之引票。查引票爲運鹽之執照。本無世襲罔替之理。而鹽商所領引票。在我民國亦未繳納如何代價。故事實上縱有以引票作借貸之抵押。亦不過爲信用擔保之一種。絶不能與有價證券相比擬。而况專商本身之性質。亦不過爲國家所指定之運鹽代理人。而並非爲私法上之商人。若輩雖號稱專商。實則根本無鹽斤之專賣權也。</p>
<p>政府收回引票。本無需給與代價。惟據去年四月淮南四岸專商呈文。民國十八年間。政府曾徵繳淮商騐票費四百萬元。如將引票取消。應請將該項騐票費等發還各商。以昭大信云云。專商執此理由。以相要挾。實則區區四百萬元。何足爲實施新鹽法之阻梗。立法委員馬寅初氏曾謂「近年全國鹽税收入年不過一萬萬二千萬元。若照新鹽法至少年可得二萬萬八千餘萬元。」孰輕孰重。固顯而易見者也。</p>
<p>至於就塲徵税。必先能整理塲産。改良緝私。整理塲産。以求鹽斤存放之安全。而其法則首在建築倉坨。集中存鹽。鹽務稽核所前曾提議建築長蘆鹽坨。以爲全國模範。嗣又推廣及於川南。淮北。及揚子四岸。各坨内外盡量添置交通設備。緝私剿匪。均稱便利。顧緝私剿匪。賴各省緝私隊及塲警之盡職守法。不然則如在廢清時代。蘇浙兩省亦有所謂「鹽捕營」之組織。而營中之統領管帶。類皆招撫歸順之梟匪痞敗。居緝私之名而行走私之實。則塲産縱能整理。仍未足以杜絶漏私也。夫就塲徵税。無非使坨内之鹽。一税之後。聽民運銷。不加限制耳。若在未税之前。已能私運偷銷。則税率縱極輕微。　亦必不能與無税之私鹽相競爭。就塲徵税之舉。根本不能實行。欲圖税率之减輕及均衡。又何所望乎。故建築鹽坨與改良緝私。同爲當務之急。而不容偏廢也。去冬五中全會。已有在民國二十五年底完全實行新鹽法之决議。而掌理新鹽法一切計劃之改革委員會。亦將不日成立。去鹽政之困民久矣。今旣有此除舊布新之轉機。豈可長此蹉跎。吾人敢在改革委員會成立之前夕。大聲疾呼。要求新鹽法中「就塲徵税」「自由買賣」二事之實現。</p>

<h3>大雪初霽細雨濛濛薩爾投票踴躍</h3>
<p>德邊火炬澈夜不息</p>
<p>各敎堂齊鳴鐘祈禱</p>
<p>勝利民屬德已可確</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　大雪兩日、今晨九時左右始細雨濛濛、道路泥濘、投票人仍踴躍至票匱、村人爭乘公共汽車火車而往、其無公共交通之處、投票人則不惜拖泥帶水徒步跋涉、據最初之形勢觀之、投票人數必甚衆多、蓋過去數日中、各派之互相鬥法與公開宣傳、已使居民興奮之情、不能自禁、力苟勝任者必往投票也、截至發電時止、並無暴動或不規則之示威行動發生、國際警備隊則駐紥營房整裝待發、苟無危急之事、决不輕易出動、投票將於今晚八時結束、届時則此項警備隊將開出分頭護送票匱至薩爾白魯根、以待檢票、據熟悉實際情形者之觀察、投票結果、薩爾必歸德國無疑、　惟欲維持現狀者當亦大有人在、而贊成歸法者則可謂絶無僅有、兹悉現有多人提出抗議、謂國家社會黨徒曾用印刷品散發全境人家、施行恫嚇云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>薩爾白魯根　氣候甚冷、但薩爾人民今晨衝寒而出、盈千累萬、齊集投票處、以期决定其祖國之前途、路中積雪頗深、步行者固多、而乘車來鎭者尤衆國社黨員執鏟除雪、肅清街道、遇汽車之陷於雪中者曳而出之、行人稱便、各投票處極形活動、立候者輒數百人、因入内投票、每次以四人爲限也、門外貼有「請勿開口」字樣、衆皆遵誡、秩序頗好、兵警到塲者甚少、午後一時、估計已投業人數約及什四、德國前總理巴本清晨偕其夫人與二女到此投票、在人羣中等候十分鐘之久、今日最低抵此者爲一婦人、伊從上海出發、路經西伯利亞、在火車中十六天、今晨始抵柏林、特僱飛機、趕來投票、全城雪花飛舞、而亂事謡言亦散佈天空、但今午路透社記者數人、分乘汽車、赴各處巡視、除兒童拾雪戲擲外、未見有騷擾也、聽途中與酒肆中人之言語、覺國社黨自信必獲勝利、從有滋擾、亦不致損及其勝利機會、然亦有人恐極端反對國社黨者、將於投票後、發生亂事、以期左右國聯行政院、俾通過劃分薩爾土地之决議、惟在目前、任何方面未有發難之徵象也、今晨投票處門外所有之聲浪、厥爲寂然無聲、靜待挨次投票者爭踏足以取煖耳、路透記者問一辦事員曰、汝似未有警察保護、彼答曰、余料余石需此、但若有事、令僅須停止其投票、而全區將感受再來投票之麻煩矣、午後記者見英兵在營讀書寫字、或於口琴聲韻中、作各種游戲、某軍答記者之問話、謂隊中僅有一人、能操德語、亦不解當地土音、然吾人與居民相處甚安也云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>投票陣綫沉着</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾公民投票進行狀况至爲安靜、此與近數日來人心興奮情形適相對照、就旁觀者所感印象、則投票形勢、可以一言蔽之、卽「公民投票中陣綫上寂靜無事可記」是也、自今晨起、各處投票所中、選民多如潮湧、大有一日之内、各種手續皆可結束之概、投票所内一切情形、皆經事前規定、故其正確無訛、與數學方式無異、每一投票所前、有國社主義派德國陣綫團團員一隊、臂纒白章、而社會黨與共産黨聯合陣綫團員一隊、則臂纒紅章、相向而立、寂靜無譁、選民行經兩隊團員之前入内、趨至投票桌前、在中立國辦事員監視下、以本人護照及選民證書、遞交市參事會議員審閲、由該議員授予封套及選票、票上載有三種辦法、卽（一）歸還德國、（二）歸併法國、（三）維持現狀、選民當在所擇定辦法之旁、劃一十字、任何舉動或言語足以指出選民之見地者、一律禁止、選民在隔離室内劃就十字之後、卽在中立國主任監視下投票入匭、事畢退出、投票者乘電車時、只須以選民證書出示卽可免費、故薩爾電車乘客、擁擠情况允稱空前、此間自清晨起、卽雪花紛飛、一望皆白、街上並無警察及軍隊之蹤跡、所覩者、惟德國陣綫團所置木牌、滿貼告白、申説本日關係之重大而已、又行政委員會决定本日各種刊物、一禁止出售、德國各報、乃於昨夜趕速出售、對於敵黨、散播荒唐無稽之消息、卽如謂敎廷機關報羅馬觀察報、對於天主敎反國社主義之新薩爾郵報、加以貶斥云云、實則全非眞相、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各派精神抖擻</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　據負責方面消息、公民投票將展緩舉行之謡言、實無根據、社會黨與共産黨之聯合陣綫、藉口日耳曼陣　施行嚴重之恐怖主義、請求展緩投票、已爲管理委員會拒絶、管理委員會爲遏制人心激昻防杜意外事端起見、今日下令、明日薩爾境内概不准印發傳單、發刊報紙、且不准出售烈酒、明日各店售賣淡酒與啤酒、以午後二時至五時及晚七時至九時爲限、今日大雪、預料載運各處票匭之汽車、並運送投票人至其原籍投票之特放火車數百輛、駛行均將稍緩、今夜全境諸小山及德邊界一帶、均燃火炬、澈夜不息、各敎堂則鳴鐘不輟、</p>
<p>今無論日耳曼陣綫與聯合陣綫所得票數孰多、而主張以薩爾合併於法國之票數、必甚寥寥、蓋袒法派散居各地、旣無團體、復無報紙從事宜傳、能否得五千票、尙屬疑問也、就另一觀察點而論、公民投票、實爲一至饒興味之事、蓋薩爾人民本爲德人、而今竟可自由投票、表示其對希特勒主義之意見、不懼報復也、國社黨與共産黨今對於公民投票、均非常注意、蓋此舉不啻使德元首希特勒與其同志受最高之試騐、又不啻爲一自由選舉、以覘人民對於國社黨之政策具何趨向也、共産黨與社會當因邇來歐洲各國先後實施狄克推多制、壓倒彼等之權力、皆爲痛心疾首、故於此次投票、乃各抖擻精神、作最後之抵抗、</p>
<p>據日内瓦路透電訊、該處皆料薩爾舉行公民投票之際、不致發生重大之騷亂、如果接有薩爾白魯根嚴重之警報、則將於明夜召集國聯行政院緊急會議、</p>
<p>據柏林電訊、當薩爾公民投票舉行之際、德國各敎堂均將鳴鐘一小時、聞德國各敎堂且將祈禱、「公道勝利」、德當道爲防不利於德國之消息傳播民衆起見、曾命秘密警察没收昨日出版之英法文各報、僅英泰晤士報與法時報除外、</p>
<p>又據日内瓦消息、英國一俟公民投票結果旣明、擬儘速對薩爾之前途作切實之决議、現望在下星期杪本届國聯行政院會議結束時、可作此决議、日内瓦人士現皆視今後數日爲歐洲歷史上最重大轉變點之一、</p>
<p>近數月内、英法對於薩爾問題、曾密切合作、據現勢觀之、兩國之合作、仍將繼續進行、英外相西門·掌壐大臣艾登·法外長賴伐爾·今日曾在日内瓦會談兩小時、雙方意見、頗爲融洽云、</p>
<p>薩爾猶太居民今日宣稱、彼等曾接「勸告」、令於今夜赴德、而於下星期公民投票辦竣後歸來、歸來時、須出其曾在德蓋印之護照、以證明彼等來參與投票云、聞此項勸告、來自國社黨方面、謂如此則薩爾如歸還德國、猶太居民可免受懲治之報復云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>坦克車運票匱</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　薩爾大雪初霽、一白如銀、黄昏時候、全區最高之卑路斯山巅烽火大舉、國社黨員謂此項烽火係表示「投票之前夕一切薩爾人民皆應念及在德同胞」之意、同時二十五英里之外、德國邊境各處高地亦齊舉烽火相應、而敎堂中則鐘聲齊鳴、投票人民自德國來者有二十五專車、皆爲積雪所阻、當地交通亦大爲不便、投票箱聞將用意大利之坦克車運輸、蓋此法旣可保持投票箱之安全、亦可不爲雪所阻也、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>國聯靜待結果</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）現已確知國聯會行政院本届會期、將俟對於薩爾公民投票之結果予以「解釋」、及遇必要時、對於薩爾主權移交問題採取决定以後、始能散會、在公民投票結果揭曉以前、行政院將於明日開始討論議程所載各項問題、大約當俟星期杪始能蔵事、期間法德兩國專家將由薩爾三人委員會主持、在意大利境内擇一地點進行談判、俾關於薩爾各項經濟財政問題之解决辦法、曾於去年十一月間三人委員會在羅馬成立恊定、予以規定者、得以見諸實行云（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>薩爾投票意義</h3>
<p>薩爾白魯根　明日爲薩爾區域舉行公民投票之期、届時薩爾男女公民五十五萬人、享有投票之權利、其中加入德國陣線之薩爾人民、認爲希特勒卽日耳曼主義之化身、正與希特勒以前之歷届統治者相同、然社會黨·共産黨及若干天主敎徒、則以爲希特勒制度、實爲德國之茶毒、如希特勒秉政一日、則薩爾區域一日不能與德國合併云、雙方意見雖絶對相反、然均承認一月十三日之投票、爲德國委希特勒鬥爭之最後挣扎、倘投票結果、維持現狀派獲得勝利、則傳統之日耳曼主義、不啻另闢蹊徑、爭取反希特勒之「第四德國」、由是觀之、則此次薩爾公民投票、已成爲一種原則上之鬭爭、宜乎其爲全世所注目也、在此次公民投票之鬭爭中、國社黨恃有種種之便利、國社黨從事大規模之宣傳、對於不投票贊成歸併德國者、認爲背叛日耳曼主義及祖國、此種宣傳効力殊大、此外復派黨員向居民威脅、其不願盲從國社黨之主張者、當將姓名列入黑册、加以懲處、惟維持現狀派、則在數星期以來、亦大有所成就、彼輩竭力向薩爾人民辯明、謂目前投票贊成維持現狀、並非與德國完全脱離、將來德國政局改變、薩爾區域仍可舉行第二次公民投票、以歸併德國、薩爾人民因此傾向維持現狀者、亦繁有徒、此外羅馬敎皇屢經宣佈天主敎會對於薩爾投票、取完全中立態度、因此敎徒將各本個人意志以投票、明日投票時之最後勝負、天主敎徒實處舉足輕重之地位、總之投票結果、目前絶難預測、卽各方面票數之比例、亦無法加以臆斷也、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美之大烏托邦運動（紐約通信）</h3>
<p>借此克服經濟恐慌</p>
<p>同時解决失業問題</p>
<p>復興法失敗後、繼之以「新政策」、事實上這項政策、是否有效、能不能把美國從恐慌地獄中救出來、還是疑問、因此一般知識界、都在現制度之下、努力絞腦汁、想方法、要克服當前的經濟恐慌、至於是否有效、且將他作另自一個問題、這些方法之中、最惹人注目的是「亞美利加·烏托邦·恊會」、原名爲American　Utopian　Association、縮寫爲U.S.A、與北美合衆國的縮寫完全相同、其信徒認爲這不是偶然的、於他們運動前途、很有帮助、</p>
<p>該恊會的創立人、爲紐約州·拉丁區格林威爾村出生的「優岑·李德」、這一運動、現已相當擴大、自一九三三年秋季、卽已公佈他的敎典、并且舉行了創會典禮、不過内部組織、還胃多少特殊性格、所以未能充分明瞭、但是大體已爲一般所共知了、其入會金美金三元、每月會費十仙、入會儀式、　常常是聚集一二百在一起舉行、與會的人、高舉右手宣誓、忠於合衆國憲法、確守州·市及國家一切法律、旣經宣誓入會之後、卽努力於宣傳工作、其宣傳的工具、是編就的五幕劇、由該劇劇情、卽可窺知恊恊的内容何如了、兹簡述劇情如後、</p>
<p>第一幕、佈置一深藍的舞台面、象徵着飢寒交迫的社會景况、没有錢没有家的苦景、開幕之後、就有一羣衣衫襤褸的窮人、他們在人生程途中的地位、祗有求乞、首先他們走到衣服店前、乞求衣服店商人給他們幾件衣穿、但商人問他們要現金作交換、他們却一錢不名、結果祗好挨凍、他們又走到麵包店去、　訴説他們的饑餓、要求給一點兒麵包充饑店主還是要錢、没錢連麵包屑也不給、這一羣人、就在饑餓中流浪着、同時也表現出中間商人的過惡、</p>
<p>第二幕、是高利貸者台、這一羣人又到高利貸者面前去訴苦、高利貸者承認借錢給他們、但問他們要担保物品、那些窮無所歸的人、又那有東西來担保呢、結果是日暮途窮、除甘心去作奴隷而外、别無他法、舞台也就在半黑暗裏隠去、</p>
<p>第三幕、這一羣浪人、無目的地流浪着、遇着警察、要把他們當作「肉食市民」、依違警律告發、經一再解説之後、警察似乎諒解了、但要求給些賄賂、纔放他們走路、他們當然没有可以行賄的錢、終於警察以不納税的罪名、告發他們了、所幸審判官給饑餓的勞動者以同情、更率直宣明懲罰失業者是不合理的社會制度、正要命令釋放他們的時候、高利貸者出來抗告、卽暫停頓、這一羣窮人退下、另一理智行者出來、向着高利貸者和其他的人道、「你們知道要消除貧困、必須以衆人的共同努力、代替個人的利已心、如果這樣、我就能引導你們到新的共通幸福的世界去、」</p>
<p>第四幕、佈置着理想區、這一羣窮人、不知不覺中到了該地、是一種被忘去了的人（Forgotten　men）、這是羅斯福競選時所用的標語、理智行者就在這裏對他們説明烏托邦政體和組織、</p>
<p>産業部反對現行的各種政策、而採用無間斷的過剩原則、内務部專負需要供給分配的責任、勞動部負生産責任、并着眼於機械的開發、敎育部負責敎育二十五歲以前的人、就其才能而施以適當的敎育、國防部主張大同主義、它祗處分過剩物品、對海外貿易、并廢除傳統的通貨制度、全美國都適用和的品交換制度、以對外通商、凡國民二十五歲以前是糼年、爲受敎育期間、二十五歲至四十五歲爲生産人民、四十五歲以後爲生産義務完了的人、從生産行程隠退、在勞動期間内不工作的人、就當作病人待、送到病院裏去醫治、他們没有債權債務、也没有警察機關、但由政府發給生産證和國民證、理智行者説完之後、舞台卽暗隐去、放出烏托邦的歌曲、勸人作他們的同志、</p>
<p>第五幕、首先是入會、繳三元入會金、其次是結社、并傳授給社内的暗語·信號等、</p>
<p>據説該恊會已經有了幾十萬會員、傳播可謂相當的快、這眞能解决美國的經濟困難嗎、不過證明他們在困難中的理想而已、（十二月十五日）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼復賣身道苦劉心窺請東投冀情殷</p>
<p>李士廉是親眼看到這些事的，在這時，要追着月英説話，未免不盡情理。可是放任了他過去，又没話去答復賈多才了。他心裏那樣想着時，先是猛然的站起來，隨後又慢慢的坐下來。而屁股還没有坐穏呢，他又站了起來，在他這樣不安定的情形中間，程志前早明白了，笑道：李先生好像有意物色這姑娘做如夫人。那儘可以進行，决不會因我的原故，有什麽阻碍。李士廉笑道；程先生，你看我們這樣子差不多連吃兩餐飯，都要發生問題了，還高興得起來嗎？是這前面一位賈先生，不知怎樣的，會看中了這位姑娘，很想把他弄到手。程志前淡淡的笑道：那麽，這位姑娘的身體，算是有了主顧了。李士廉道：這位賈先生是我的朋友，人很好的。他的意思，也是覺得這女孩子很可憐，要了他就是救了他一把。志前道：這位先生姓賈，哦，賈寳玉的這個賈，哈哈！那也難怪多情了。李士廉覺得這種譏笑的話，那是不應該的。一個願做小老婆，一個願娶小老婆，旁觀者説這些廢話作什麽？心裏籌畫着，便也想來報復他兩句，只在他想心事的這空當裏，茶房竤上一張請客帖子，另外還有一張紅紙寫的知單。志前接過請帖，先向桌上一扔，笑道：怎麽又請客？這才去看知單，李士廉的坐位，去桌子不遠，恰好那張合折的請帖，向上張開着極力的睜睜眼睛看去，見上面寫着是高鶴聲謹訂。高鶴聲就是建設廳廳長，不想程志前也認得。説他在西安，是位凖闊人，那並非過甚之辭。自已正想鑽建設這條路子，這個人是應當聯絡的。（一一一）</p>
<h3>清道夫戴紅帽子的來歷</h3>
<p>— 綠蕪</p>
<p>在上海，無論那一條街上，我們都可以看見戴紅帽子穿紅背心的清道夫，很謹愼地在那裏工作，打的巡街道上的殘物，和人們在無意中抛棄的菓皮紙片兒。</p>
<p>爲什麽他們要戴紅顔色的帽子呢？</p>
<p>在一七九二年，那是正當法國大革命高潮的時候，國王路易十六的一部分忠實衛隊，看到那時巴黎的民衆革命情緒的緊張，也反叛起來了，偷偷地跑到民衆革命軍的一方面來，帮助做革命的工作。</p>
<p>但是，其中有一部分的反叛士兵，給没有反叛的衛隊捉住了，把他們送到人衆很多的地方去，罰他們在那裏做苦工，並且替他們戴上紅顔色的帽子，他們的用意：一方面怕他們逃走，這紅顔色的帽子，眞的，引起了不少人的注意。</p>
<p>這是一種懲罰和極大的侮辱。</p>
<p>當時巴黎的革命民衆們，看見站在自已同一條戰綫上的革命同志，受了這樣大的侮辱和痛苦，很表同情。可是，一時想不出什麽好的方法來，帮助他們解脱這種恥辱，後來大家索性都戴上紅顔色的帽子，使這班看守的衛隊們混亂視綫，看不清楚誰是被逮捕的士兵。不久，有許多莫名其妙的民衆，也照樣的戴上一頂紅帽子來，表示神氣，後來，戴的人越發多起來了，紅帽子，竟變爲革命份子的記號。</p>
<p>可是，這被誤解認爲革命份子神氣記號的紅帽子，在現在的上海，又回復最初的被罰做苦工的標記的制帽了！你看，現在，不僅是清道夫戴紅帽子，火車站上的脚夫，碼頭上的工人……那一個苦工不是戴紅顔色的帽子呢？</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顔鑫泉）</p>
<p>ＳＳ女士是高唱抱獨身主義者。可是追逐伊的男子，何止一打，我有些疑異。後來，據内中某君説：「伊雖高唱抱獨身主義，足證現在是孤單單的，可説是伊的一種反計，正給我們一條路，等到伊有了對方時，不怕伊不喊戀愛神聖！」</p>
<h3>李先生别傳</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「李先生眞是一個奇特的人，」認識他的人，都是這樣的説。原來李先生有幾樁古怪的牌氣，值得大家認爲古怪的，現在寫在下面，做一個李先生的别傳吧。</p>
<p>第一，李先生對於用錢方面，是没有方針的，不當用則用，當用則不用，這是他用錢方法的與人不同處。然而，因此造成了他經濟時常拮据的狀態，但是，他到了經濟困難的時候，却有一個方法，解决他的難關，那就是「臥而不起」，嘴裏並且還喊着説。「我錢没有了，所以，在這裏長期抵抗呀」。</p>
<p>復次，李先生對於交際，倒是十分廣闊的，原來他不論何人，只要有一面之交，便認爲是生平知已了！並且時常拿了别人家的卡片，向人説。「這人如何如何，我和他關係，如何密切」，可是，人家請他代爲介紹時，李先生終是説，我和他不過見過一次面，恐怕他也不認識我哩。」</p>
<p>最後，我們的李先生，他是很歡喜女人的，尤其是年輕的女人，他更爲歡迎，因爲他是做醫生的，看見年輕的女人來診治疾病，他連犧牲水果來招待，也是義不容辭的，反之，假如男子們去求診治，倘使他在不高興的時候，睬都不高興去睬他，這種牌氣，我們大家認爲是很特别的。</p>
<p>所以，我覺得像這位李先生，有替他寫别傳以資宣傳的必要。</p>
<h3>零剪店</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>當你拿着高貴些的衣料到裁縫那兒做衣服。他們總得在你的衣料上揩些料去，尤其皮料是他們的好主顧，灰鼠揀挺好的偷一隻，狐皮揀毛厚的剪幾寸，就是起碼的羊皮也不肯放過的，所以我們的皮袍穿了相當時間，裏邊的皮會縮得比面子相差一兩寸高低，這原因；因爲他們做的時候心裏存了揩你的油，把皮拉大着噴水做。</p>
<p>裁縫師務揩了料去賣給零剪店，所以我們在做高貴一些的皮袍之類最好先同他説；做好了多給你些酒錢，不然你的衣服上會受到無形的損失的。</p>
<p>零剪店所薈萃的地方最多在城裏的三牌樓，城外石路一帶，他們店裏出賣着綾羅綢緞，呢絨嗶嘰，還高掛着灰鼠狐皮，羊皮糕皮，皮領之類，呢絨嗶嘰，不過賣給人家做做鞋面，添添貼邊，皮貨則由幾寸起到整件的袍料褂統，這些，都是不惜工本地一片片由零而成整的，所以有些所謂「老門檻」者做皮袍祗要放眼光上零剪店去揀，貨色又好，價錢倒也便宜。</p>
<p>冬季是裁縫司務出貨最多的時節了，逢五逢十是他們所謂「下班」停夜工，在燈光照耀的零剪店門前擁擠着人羣，喧攘地在成交他們的貨物。</p>
<p>裁縫司務雖則精於揩人家的油，可是錢到了手就會化光的，不是來幾剷「五百剷」便是上遊戲塲，或者還會去「打野鷄」。</p>

<h3>碎琤記</h3>
<p>— 汪放庵</p>
<p>琤，文字交青陽曹夢魚兄掌上珠也。一名阿琪，今甫十齡，生有自來，具絶頂聰明之相，讀書過目不忘，所爲文亦斐然可觀，歐西語言，琅琅上口，邇方肄業威海衛路民智小學五年級，其乖巧冠儕輩。廼不幸於月之十五晚，慘罹意外之災！以夢魚是晚擦槍不愼，珠彈横飛，適琤趨近，遂遭誤中，不及醫治，竟爾玉殞！人間心　，一現曇花，噩耗爭傳，罔弗悼惜。予與夢魚相交之始，遠在十年；初未識荆，旋夢魚主辦駱駝畫報，移家滬瀆；挈萬夫人與琤，同居同孚路上，余適來中，專誠過訪，時琤纔五齡，如小鳥依人，偎於萬夫人之懷，見生客但作憨笑，而茯剪水雙瞳，輒復對予凝視不置：予愛而撫其額，「伯伯」之聲，即脱口出。不由人不訝其敏捷。余與夢魚晤談間，又聞其曼聲唱，「葡萄仙子，」音清句楚，且舞且歌。夢魚伉儷。皆大歡喜。余嘗以小天使名之，方寸間深羡夢魚伉儷福慧雙修；得此佳兒，承歡膝下。聞夢魚言：此時琤已識字逾千，皆萬夫人所授，歐孟遺風，又不禁於心慶幸夢魚得此賢内助也。越三載，予僦居湖畔，桂子香時，夢魚及萬夫人與琤不速而至，來觀浙江潮。約爲嚮導。遨遊兩日，遍及湖畔諸勝。琤已八齡，效垂髫之裝，問所識字倍曩時，當小舟容與湖心間，琤每有一二解人語，使人軒渠。且似與予夫婦及亡兒鐵如有夙緣，每删余夫婦講湖上故事，並逗鐵兒歡笑，嬌聲呼弟弟，復貽贈其所心愛之玩具數事。别之日，琤又堅邀余等届新年假期，去滬歡叙，令人依依不捨，其知禮嘆爲觀止。是年冬余遭鐵兒殤，心緒惡劣，回鄉休養，杜門不出，遂與夢魚音疎問絶。然每與山荆枕上夢回，傷悼鐵兒之餘，又未嘗不置念琤弗已焉。余索居迄今，並無聊賴，前月之初，始經夢魚寵招，撲被來滬，爲其佐治，藉遣餘閒。廼與琤朝夕相處，察其治學之勤，我疑非十齡幼女，所克臻此。近萬夫人持家多勞，課女稍怠，惟琤燈前問字質難之殷，一如往昔，自余來此，轉而向余求深詣，且堅欲余爲其補習西文，自念此道荒疏，垂十五載，惟字體讀音，稍能辦解：却之不得，眞䩄然也，越月回鄉，臨行訂約此後重來，每逢日曜，爲之課讀，余雖患爲人師，而琤殷殷致意，屢囑早歸，從事開硯。牽衣惜别，彷彿家人，詎料人天永訣，竟在此朝夕間邪？余回鄉之後，輒與山荆談及琤之好學，　深恨吾家兩女習於荒嬉。山荆亦嘗置念琤之聰明可愛，因屬稍具菓物，携贈於琤。十六日，余返申江，征塵甫卸，偶翻報紙，即赫然見琤之凶訊。驚魂稍定，急驅車過夢魚家，至則此訊竟非虚傳，悲夫！夢魚見予，涙泗横流，萬夫人則哽咽不語，予亦悲不自勝，無言可以慰藉也。良久，聞夢魚云：余自置槍，素愼重，珠彈從不敢上膛，近以天寒歲暮、深宵歸去，恐遇匪人，遂置身畔，是夕回家之時，照例即將珠彈取出，不知何以槍管中竟致遺有一粒，遂釀慘禍。事後余商守法計，即報有司。此際心痛如搗，悔恨交併，不知將何以慰阿琪於地下也。聞琤殮之日，面色如生，笑容可掬，創傷絶無血跡，然則琤殆刦滿人間，歸其瑶島乎？嘗聞昔人所語及兵解劍解之例，猶或似之。夢魚固性情中人，遭凶此閔凶，竟致誤碎掌上明珠，此際此情，予亦不得不聊以荒誕之言相慰，冀其稍殺悲懷矣！夢魚又告予云：琤向承友好憐愛，凡同文中，罔不贊其敏慧：日來且蒙瘦鵑慕琴空我儷琴諸先生，紛紛慰問，盛意銘心。並擬蒐集琤兒在校遺作，附以哀辭，印行「傷曇録」以資紀念云。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>説到這裏，太后爲着要使我們深信伊所説的話一些没有僞托的緣故，便隨手指出了幾件現實的鐵證來。那是懸掛在一口大橱裏的許多武器。這口橱是没有門的，而且所處的地位很向陽，我們站在外面看，已是看得非常清楚：劍和箭大都是生銹了，弓弦也爛毁了，但每一件東西上，都有很醒目的字跡鑿着，例如：「某某（領袖的名字）於某年某月某日以此劍手刃一虎」，或「某某於某年某月某日以此弓此箭獵獲一豹」；不過都是滿文，我們照理是看不懂的，幸而有一個熱習這種文字的女官給我們充翻譯，才得完全明瞭。太后對於這人所翻譯出來的字句也很注意，並有一種得意的神氣；原來伊最初也祗是隨意猜度，以爲這些兵器之所以很鄭重地收拾着的緣故，總不外乎是表彰先人的武略的意思，因此便忙着指點給我們看了，却不道伊的猜度竟是完全對的，這樣伊當然是很得意了！</p>
<p>在左面的一間屋子中，我又發現了一件很奇怪的東西：那是兩個已經銹蝕得很難看的鐵環，環的圓徑大概比最腾的人的手腕更大一些；這兩個環是用兩條並不連繫着的繩打屋樑上掛下來的，掛得和一個中等身材的人的肩膀一樣高。那兩條繩原來必然是很粗壯堅實的，現在是已經霉爛了，仿彿祗須用手去輕輕一拉，便立卽可以斷下來的模樣。（二二一）</p>

<h3>實施義務敎育標本兼治辦法案</h3>
<p>查實施義務敎育最爲吾國今日當務之急、本黨政綱原有厲行國民敎衣之一項、訓政時期約法、亦有已達學齡兒童、應一律受義務敎育之一條、蓋我國大多數人民、並最低限度之敎育、亦未經受、無論國家政令社會建設施行舉辦動生障閡復興民族最基本之工作、無過於義務敎育者、舊有四年義務敎育辦法、雖經中央及地方敎育當局、努力督策進行、卒因經費困乏、師資稀少、及其他種種關係收效、尙徵直至今日、通都大邑、觸目皆是文盲、窮鄉僻壤、更不待言、據敎育部十九年度統計、入學兒童僅佔學齡兒童百分之二一０八、際此世界風雲緊迫之秋　、吾人尙不採　取更有效之方法、於最短時間、推行義務敎育、則民族前途、實有不堪殷憂者、敎育部前曾訂定小學法規、經過立法程序、於二十一年十二月、由國府公布、此外又有第一期實施義務敎育辦法大綱及短期義務敎育實施辦法大綱、於廿一年六月由部公布、並已編就短期小學課本四册、段發應用、此外則有小學採用二部制之通令、徒以未有强迫法令、令各省市遵照辦理、故寛嚴遲早、頗未能一致、兹特將前項辦法申叙概略、並擬具意見如下、</p>
<p>（一）應限期實施一年制之短期義務敎育、對十足歲至十六足歲年長失學兒童、實行强迫敎育、此爲洽標辦法、</p>
<p>民國九年、曾有舉辦義務敎育之法令、其推行期限爲一年、國民政府成立後、第二次全國敎育會議、改定義務敎育推行期限爲二十年、然其推行對象、皆爲四年、義務敎育所需經費之浩大、所需敎員之衆多、衡諸國家財力社會經濟及現有師資之實際狀况、皆相去甚遠、欲達到敎育普及之目的、殆有河清無期之概、查前頒短期義務敎育辦法、结爲適應我國特殊環境之救急方策、將義務敎育之期限、暫時縮短爲一年之短期、小學或短期小學班、使十足歲至十六足歲之年長失學兒童、每日分班受二小時之敎育、並免收學費、供給書籍用品、以便貧寒子弟、得以一面工作、一面免費入學、二十年來、中央及地方提倡推行義務敎育、不可謂不力、然而經時久、用力多而獲效甚鮮者、實以四年義務敎育、所需經費師資、亦屬數量太巨之故、短期小學或短期小學班、則以一數員於上午下午及晚間、分敎年長失學兒童三班、以每班四十人計之、一年中得畢業兒童一百二十人、與普通小學兒童兩班、予以全日之敎育、亦以每班四十人、計四年畢業、兒童僅八十人、兩相比較、經費多寡之懸殊、不啻一與十八之比也、短期小學或短期小學班之課程、僅爲識字及簡單常識、淺易算術、敎學至易、不過視現行民衆學校略進一步、稍知書算者、均能擔任、故其師資、不限曾受經受師範訓練及有若何之敎學經騐與普通中學課程繁多、敎員必須嚴格檢定者、情形各殊、前項實施辦法大綱、規定敎職員、除聘請合格敎員外、應充分利用下列人員、（一）當地師範學校或鄉村師範學校、已届實習之師範生、（二）已受相當訓練可爲代用敎員之師塾敎師、（三）當地公務人員、（四）當地具有相當程度之人員、（五）志願擔任敎員並盡義務者、將敎員資格特别放寛、此各國開始舉辦義務敎育時、共有之事實也、且年事較長學習能力亦較富、一年之效果、有時或竟與六歲入學受四年敎育者相差無幾、而年長之人、一經畢業即可出而服務、就整個社會言、又不啻逐年增加多量之識字青年也、查各國實施義務敎育、皆從推廣小學敎育着手、使小學敎育成爲義務敎育、而其義務敎育年限、亦逐漸延長、我國文盲太多、財力太絀、義務敎育與小學敎育、實不能併爲一事、對於年長失學兒童、縮短其義務敎育年限、以期迅速普及、實爲至不得已之事、根據上違理由、擬請由中央規定、自二十四年度起、爲實施義務敎育開始時期、暫以四年爲期、並指定短期小學或短期小學班爲實施義務敎育塲所對於十足歲至十六足歲之年長失學兒童、實行强迫敎育、</p>
<p>（二）注意竭力推廣小學敎育並切實推行半日二部制、此爲治本辦法、</p>
<p>前述短期義務敎育、　乃專爲救年長失學兒童而設、至爲增加學齡兒童入學機會、提高普通小學敎育效率起見、則對於小學敎育之推廣充實、尤屬切要、前訂小學法小學規程、關於地方敎育之研究、小學編制經費之支配、設備之充實、訓育之改革、敎職員之待遇推修、均有嚴密之規定、尤於科程一事、特别注重、以期現有各小學得遵此種種規定、以充實其内容、在第一期實施義務敎育辦法大綱中、並規定分年分區及實騐推行之程序、以期漸臻普遍、然逐期逐地實騐推行、頗需年歲師資之造就、雖一面於普通師範學校外、又增設簡易師範學校簡易師範科行别師範科、然亦緩不應急、且亦無從於短時期間訓練多量之人才、則又不得不另想應急辦法此辦法、爲何即採用二部制是也、據十九年度統計全國小學幼稚園數二五０八四０所、小學敎員數五六八四八四人、在學兒童數一０九九四八九七九人、平均每一校收兒童僅四十四名、每一敎師敎兒童僅十九名、不經濟若此、實爲世界各國所鮮見、彼敎育發達經濟、遠勝於吾之國家、每一敎員、所敎兒童、均多於吾、以吾國之貧瘠反此浪費、殊不合理、即國家前途之危險、亦有不堪設想者、二部制爲就現有經費師資之數量、於兩不增加之原則下、力謀小學敎育擴充發展之絶好辦法、歐州大戰以後、已有若干國家、先後採用頗著成效、而半日二部制、較間時二部制、尤適合於目前、吾國經濟原則、以無須增添校舍及游戲休息塲所也、就兒童獲益言之二部制、雖稍不及普通小學、惟相差亦不致過遠、且爲整個社會、着想少數之在學兒童、爲大多數之失學兒童、略爲减少幾分敎育上之幸福、以盡互助之天職、衡情論理、亦屬應然、二部制推行後、各小學經費敎員、祗須略事增加、即可添收加倍之兒童、換言之、即一校可以作兩校之用、全國頓增加一倍之小學、一面並將現有小學、盡量利用、充實學額、則兒童入學機會、當可增加數倍、寖寖將普及於全體學齡兒童矣、根據上述理由、擬請中央積極提倡由國民政府明令全國各小學切實、推行半日二部制、諸鄉村城市小學、供不應求之處、所尤須力求照吹、一面並利用私塾敎師、加以訓練、以補上列各項師範敎育之不足、</p>
<p>至上述義務敎育經費之來源、在實施辦法大綱中、業有詳明之規定、其大要除就地籌措外、得呈請主管敎育行政機關、予以補助、惟實行强迫以後地方經費不敷之數、必更巨大、擬請中央自二十四年度起、另行指定的欵、力爲補助、并令各省市、亦自二十四年度起、各撥的欵、專爲實施短期義務敎育及推行小學二部制之用、（查二十年十二月二十一日第四届中央執行委員會第三次全體會議、關於敎育之决議案、（甲）關於國民敎育者其二三兩項、對此曾有規定合併聲明、」上述實施義務敎育標本兼治辦法、是否有當、敬候公决、提案人蔡元培葉楚傖戴傳賢丁惟汾朱培德宋子文何應欽吳敬恒朱家驊、</p>

<h3>南寧市醫藥衛生概况</h3>
<p>— 志昌</p>
<p>南寧是廣西的政治中心所在，近這幾年來開闢馬路擴充市區皆已次第完成；故繁華熱鬧較勝於往昔，人口倍增，而對於衛生之設施比往昔亦略爲完備。醫藥的設備則没有多大的發展，現我把全市的醫藥衛生的現狀略述於下：</p>
<p>（一）公共衛生之設施</p>
<p>公共衛生由省會公安局負全責來辦理，其設施可分爲下列數項述之：（一）清潔－關於清潔方面，於偏僻處設立垃圾傾倒塲，若距離垃圾塲較遠之街巷則罫公共垃圾箱，由公安局製造垃圾車，每日規定時刻次數令使役推至有垃圾箱之街巷傾去箱内之垃圾，並車至一處則停若干時刻，摇鈴爲號，俾街内住户所有之垃圾得可盡傾至垃圾車，此外則請定清道伕，每日掃除街道二次，並每年由公安局通令全市舉行大掃除二次，將市内之溝渠，公厠，公衆小便所，公衆痰盂等均實行藥水消毒。（二）保健－關於保健方面，則禁售一切不清潔之飲食物，取締不合法之醫生及産婆，禁宰病畜，組織檢查隊，檢查市内公厠，各家廚房及厠所，戲院酒樓之衛生設備等。（三）防疫－關於防疫方面，則每年均贈種牛痘，市内之醫院，醫師則被聘爲義務職，每届夏季則召信要各醫院及市内之醫師組織防疫委員會，辦各種防疫藥苗贈注射於市民，舉行滅蠅運動，設置鼠箱於各街道。以上是關於公共衛生之實行，至於宣傳方面則印發各種疾病預防法，個人衛生之要點等文字之傳單或畫報。這是公共衛生之大概。</p>
<p>（二）醫院之現狀</p>
<p>南寧全市共有醫院五折，紅十字會一所，紅十字會無留醫之設備，祗做救急工作，五醫院中，内一爲公立軍醫院，三爲敎會所立，一爲私立，設備最佳而規模又大者首爲軍醫院，共有新醫師十四人，太陽燈，Ｘ光，電療等器械均有，惟留醫者祗許軍人及現受軍訓之學生，留醫者均不須出若何費用，祗須膳費每日三角小洋，官兵均一律同等看待，手術費，注射藥費，内服藥費均免·而普通人雖不留入内留醫，但每日亦規有一定之時間准許入院診治，各種費用均照收，不過較其他醫院略廉耳，敎會所設立之三所，内新醫一人者一所，新醫三人者一所，新醫二人者一所，設備不大齊全，皆屬普通設備，Ｘ光皆無，留醫之費用每日最低須二元起碼，注射藥費每針須五元起碼，手術費則隨病之輕重而定。若不留醫而到院診病者，每次診金一元，藥費及注射費照定該院所定之價目給與。以上四醫院於每日均規有一定時間贈診施藥，以利於貧病者。而私立之一所有中醫生一人，無甚設備，費用亦未詳。</p>
<p>兹將五醫院之現况列表於下：</p>
<p>名稱　醫生　立别　歲入公欵</p>
<p>廣西軍醫院　一四（西）　公立　一一０　，０００元</p>
<p>玫瑰醫院　三（西）　敎會</p>
<p>道救醫院　一（西）　敎會　一八，六九０元</p>
<p>樂園醫院　二（西）　敎會</p>
<p>普濟留醫院　一（中）　私立</p>
<p>（三）私設醫務所及藥房之現狀</p>
<p>南寧全市共有舊醫一百二十九人，新醫三十八人，以兩者醫務相較，舊醫較佳，這當然是指一般的而言，若屬名醫，醫務當甚繁。有這種現象的原因，約可分爲數端：（一）舊醫費用較廉，藥價亦不貴，若在新醫，當學醫的時候，已用去不少的金錢財力，待學成出而懸壺濟世的時候，醫學器械的設備所費亦鉅，所以所取的報酬當然較昻，加以藥來自外洋，運至内地抽税甚重，所以藥價亦貴，而舊醫旣無須若何設備，醫術又多屬祖傳，所以没要多大的費用，故所取亦廉。普通每診一次，舊醫之診金數角卽可，而新醫須一元，若病須打針，所費更鉅，所以普通一般人爲减輕負擔，而多求諸舊醫。（二）無醫德的新醫作弊使人對於新醫失信仰－有没有醫德的新醫，利用一般人不知到新藥價之輕重，與不知何病用何藥，所以一醫病人時，欲使病者不速愈，冀得多金，往往給不關重要的藥内服，或注射以蒸溜水又説是注射某藥，須費若干，使病者耗資旣鉅，病苦復不能除，因而轉診於舊醫而病得愈，病者卽向外宣傳謂新醫無用。此種醫者固少，然實新醫界中之蝥賊。（三）因個人所設之診務所設備較醫院簡陋，一般有病而欲求於新醫者，見個人所設之醫務所設備不全而多入醫院，此亦私設診務冷淡之原因。</p>
<p>現在再略説到藥房，南寧有中藥房五十九間，西藥房十六所，藥房之營業本視乎醫生之診業之濃淡，但西藥房成藥甚多，一般經濟充裕的人見其服法便利，又無須乎請敎醫師，故購者亦不少。</p>
<p>（編者按）－志昌先生提出南寧新醫不　發達的原因有三點：（一）醫費太貴，（二）受不道德新醫的影響：（三）設備不完備。這三點中間，除第二點須新醫本身自已努力外，其他二點均與經濟有關，我們一面希望新醫界團結起來，一面希望政府盡力帮助，來扶持這個新醫的萌芽。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十一）　再歸熱</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做再歸熱？</p>
<p>（答）這是一種流行性或地方性的傳染病。由於數種螺旋體寄生在血中而起。</p>

<p>（答）退熱後各種病狀可以消退。脾臟也縮小。脈搏變爲緩徐。病人覺得很爽快。</p>
<h3>一年來之中國醫藥衛生（二）</h3>
<p>— 江晦鳴</p>
<p>引言－醫學的敎育－醫學的團體活動－醫事的糾紛－醫學的出版界－醫學的考察－醫事的建設－軍醫的訓練－舊醫藥界的一斑－新藥業的動態－鄉村衛生的調查－都市衛生觀－結論</p>
<p>（三）醫學團體的活動</p>
<p>醫學團體活動，在二十三年中，確爲一大轉變時期，請詳言之：</p>
<p>二十三年春，第三届全國醫師聯合會，在首都舉行，集南北之菁英，聚東西之名碩，且得政府袞袞諸賢，爲之力與匡助，輿論推崇，社會重視，科學醫蓬勃之兆，大有含蕊怒放之態，吾人偶一追溯歷史陳跡：猶知日本自明治維新後，科學醫其所以一日千里，賴有政法力量爲之推動；吾國科學醫，其所以趦起不前，卽無政治力量爲之扶持，故政治於醫學之進展上，適爲一大原動力。廼者，第三届全國醫聯會，黨國名賢，殆無不知斯會之重要，且能深明醫學與民族之關係，際兹民族復興之高潮中，頗能力與提倡，逆料此後中國之科學醫學，將因斯會而有相當之進展。</p>
<p>更有爲吾人所慶幸者，一年來中華醫學會，及第九届遠東熱帶醫學會，先後在京舉行，所提出專門研究業蹟，盈篇累牘，多爲吾國學者心血之結晶，一洗吾國在國際上無醫學研究人才之恥！斯會之卜，吾國醫學前途之光明，大有</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>氣象萬千之活躍。但吾人稍一追求，尙有深值吾人深自猛惕者在：此次學會中，吾國學者而有特殊貢獻者，類多寄人籬下，進行研究工作；如林宗揚，余賀，陶熾蓀，楊述祖，谷景汧諸先生等，或在上海雷氏德研究院，或在北平恊和醫學院，或在上海自然科學研究所，依人作嫁，此爲吾人所深表遺憾者也。吾國旣爲獨立國家之一，豈可無國人自辦之醫學研究機關，以爲儲材研究之所？是有望於吾界同仁及政府當局，亟謀積極興辦，能於今後國際醫壇上，爭取無上光榮。</p>
<p>其次，中華民國醫藥學會，於余雲岫，陳方之，汪企張，郭琦元，陳卓人諸先生之努力下，一年來，亦頗有驚人之進步。歷見該會主辦之新醫藥逐期發表之文獻，已充分顯示極前進之象徵。</p>
<p>尙有一事堪爲吾人推心泣血而道者：卽中國科學醫之集團，在二十三年中分崩離析之痕跡，猶未能消弭於無形。其間；疊經宋國賓，龐京周，汪企張，陳方之諸先生之文字商討，迄今泯除醫派而達醫團合作之呼聲，猶未寳現！是又不知何日，始有重振「合作」旗鼓之望。</p>
<p>（四）醫事的糾紛</p>
<p>二十三年，可謂醫事糾紛年。在此一年中，醫事糾紛之多，實出吾人意料。其犖犖大者：如俞松筠，裘伯壎，沈克非，張湘紋，葛成慧，林惠貞，李元善，顧宗文等之被控案，可謂轟動全國；幸法理未泯，學理不滅，而均能平反冤獄，未遭誣陷。但至今因醫事糾紛而罹法網者，尙有人在，如江西省立醫院皮膚科主任劉懋淳及其助手被判徒刑，卽其一也。此風囂起，醫師人人危矣。</p>
<p>吾人在醫學立塲，評其是非所在　，殊難立言，蓋恐失之偏，言之者，以爲醫師中絶無庸樗誤病之人者；但核舉歷次糾紛發生之原因，醫師之被控，均非眞過失，多爲賬欵問題，宵小挑撥，感情誤用，同道諉責，甚有希圖民取償金，不顧醫師名譽而申訴訟。似此風氣乖張，是不可以無言。</p>
<p>醫學之目的：因爲維護人類健康，而達自然死者。但今日醫學之程度，雖萬象俱備；而病機之惡化，尙有隨時潛伏隨時爆發之可能，如是以云，操醫業者，焉能絶對保障病人不死？倘竟因診治病人，而不能使病人恢復康健，卽有業務過失之嫌，則此例之多，將如恒河沙數！來日方長，然則究應如何足以消滅如此意外之糾紛乎？是有亟起决定之必要。</p>
<p>第一——應發揮醫政之力量：務使江湖流醫——無正式醫校出身之醫生，未經衛生署審核登記之醫生，嚴格取締，藉以提高醫師地位，確示社會人士之信仰。第二——醫事訴訟應需公斷：由醫法二界，迅卽組織醫事訴訟之「公斷處」，凡吾正式醫師之被控者，應先受公斷處之公斷，一經公斷曲直後，再受法律之制裁。第三——實行醫事陪審制！如有醫事訴訟案件，應由法院函請學會遴選醫界名碩，出庭陪審，以便法官得有隨時諮詢之方便。第四——應請法醫鑑定：一年來所經眞茹法醫研究所所鑑定之非醫事訴訟案件，頗多成績，此後醫事訴訟案件，在相當範圍内，應交法醫鑑定。第五——應重懲揑詞控告者，使一班好訟之徒，不敢輕於試法。以上所言，乃其微言大意，深冀忠實之同界，賢明之國人，公正之有司，清介之病衆，加以注意，加以研究焉。</p>
<p>（五）醫學的出版界</p>
<p>醫學出版事業之發達，與印刷技術之優良，適爲向同一方面發展之兩平行綫。歐美列國以及隣邦日本，醫學出版事業之發達，雖由一班學者研究之精進，然印刷術之優良，確爲促成醫學出版事業發達之最大原因；蓋以醫學中之逼眞彩色揷圖，以及陰影像片，若無良好印刷，决難使吾人滿意也。吾國醫學出版界：旣少研究人才，又無優良印刷，故一年中之進步，極爲迂緩。在醫籍方面，於二十三年度出版者，計有日本同仁會發行之吳祥鳳等所譯内科學，周頌聲等合譯之生理學。北平醫刊社發行之劉兆霖所譯外科各論，陳公素編著之内科診療醫典。中華醫學會發行之宋國賓朱恒壁合編醫界指南，魯德馨所譯英國紅十字會應急療法。諸如私人發行者：約有伍連德等合著之霍亂概論，黄曼歐所著之病理學，張效宗所編之藥理學，謝筠壽所編之淋病眞相，牛惠生等譯骨拆的療救法，高鏡朗所著之兒童傳染病，陶熾蓀所著之醫學常識，趙燏黄徐伯鋆合著之生藥學，姚伯麟所編之最新内科學治療全書等寥寥十數種而已。至於衛生署，商務印書館，中華書局，大東書局，北新書局等新發行之醫學衛生叢書，數殊尠見，較之國外各國，醫學鉅著層出不窮，眞乃瞠乎其後！况印刷之簡陋，則更無論矣。</p>
<p>二十三年中之醫學雜誌刊物，並無若何進步，差强人意者，僅有過去之中華民國醫藥會誌，今乃併東南醫刊，社會醫報，科學醫報而合刊爲新醫藥；而中華醫學會出版之中華醫學雜誌，今則改爲月刊，由余雲岫先生主編，二刊之内容，嘗多偏重研究及調查方面之交獻，材料之充實，在國内醫刊中，可謂無出其右。諸如社會醫藥報，今改爲社會醫藥月刊，在評論醫刊中，堪與醫藥評論並駕齊驅，此又一轉變也。至於新出版者，如法醫月刊，醫事公論，新聞夜報之醫學週刊，齒科週刊，花柳半月刊，防癆月刊，東南校聲，河北民衆衛生雜誌等，不上十數種，於此可以極見中國醫學出版界之荒凉一斑。</p>
<p>（六）　醫學的考察</p>
<p>他山之石，可以攻錯。吾國醫學旣在萌芽滋長時期，則考察之事，不容刻緩；蓋可從考察所得，以爲改進中國醫學之借鏡也。國人嘗因忽視醫學考察之重要，一年來，例由各醫校之畢業生行數次畢業參觀，然多無統計報告，不過走馬看花，殊少意義可言。而國内正式醫學衛生機關，能派員至國外考察者，尙屬絶無僅有！二十三年上海痲瘋恊會所派鄔志堅博士赴歐考察，此爲特别發現，較與伍連德博士出國考察，同爲稀見之事。至翁之龍先生赴西北考察，在開發西北聲中，亦爲有價值之一頁。</p>
<p>所欣喜者，一年來敎育部對於醫學敎育之整理，似已具有决心，在二十三年中，先後簡派龐京周先生等視察華北華商各醫校，顔福慶先生等視察華東各醫校，此雖視察性質，要亦有關醫育之改進。吾人深望能就調查所得，於最短期間，確立今後醫學敎育之方針，以糾正過去吾國醫育茫無歸宿之錯誤。</p>
<p>（七）醫事的建設</p>
<p>國民經濟日趨慢性破産之機運中，醫事建設，固不易言；然各地醫院之添設，每因無公告之機會，亦殊難調查。今就上海方面而言，尙有多少建設於二十三年中新創見者，如虹橋療養院，建築簡潔宏壯，極爲合理。他如各醫校及各醫院在建築中而未完成者，計有上海醫學院及紅十字會醫院，將於上海棒球塲建築巍峨大厦，東南醫學院新建之實習館將告落成，廣兹醫院新建五層樓大厦將告竣工，同德醫學院正在設計建造校舍，均爲一年來之新訊。其他若江西醫專添築校舍，廣西省政府籌設醫學校，吾人無不深盼其能早觀厥成也。</p>
<p>（八）軍醫的訓練</p>
<p>值兹世界大戰前夜，各國積極擴充軍備聲中，瓜分吾國之慘象，將迫眼前。吾人凛於大難當頭：凡爲醫界積極訓練戰地救護技術，以求自效，固爲切要；然軍醫之訓練，尤不容緩。蓋因軍醫之義務，不僅限於戰爭服役，而在非戰時期，對於將士疾病之預防與治療，亦有莫大責任。二十三年夏，軍醫處長盧致德先生，曾分别調集各地各級軍醫，至南昌補習受訓，並採用行營訓練軍官之方法，授軍醫以補充知識鍜鍊體魄之機會，確爲富有價值而有意義之舉也。此不僅嘉惠將士以福利，且可養成軍醫固有之風範，吾人更希望今後軍醫同仁，每年均能歷行而無間，是則國家前途，公共衛生之前途，均利賴之。</p>
<p>（九）舊醫藥界的一斑</p>
<p>二十三年中，舊醫藥界可謂充滿烏烟瘴氣：尤以上海流行之象貝潮，更不堪言，象貝潮之起因如何？報紙喧騰，似歸咎於某合作社之壟斷；但據熟於内幕人言，其中情形，至爲複雜（請參看社會醫藥第二卷第三期之自取滅亡之象貝潮）吾人非好論是非者，此種事實眞相，非吾人所當聞問。吾人就學術立塲而言，深覺此次象貝潮之發生，確已充分暴露舊醫學説荒誕不可稽信。卽以前胡代象貝而論，有謂象貝前胡性味相近，功效自同，可以代用者；有謂象貝前胡，性味雖同，功效則逈不个侔，不可代用者，各執一説，振振有詞，嗚呼，足證舊醫一切學説，類多無絶對眞理！如此學説，焉能與近代科學醫學，爭長較短，而不爲時代怒潮所捲没，豈可得乎？</p>
<p>至於舊醫之醫糾紛，亦嘗層見不窮，此乃世風日下，夫復何言！吾人固亦深望舊醫界亟謀業務之保障也。</p>
<p>舊醫出版界，奄無生氣，今朝若昔！其間，雖有不乏致力於改進舊醫學者，然均以無明辨是非之頭腦，無實騐之根據與知識，無良好自然科學之基礎，徒以剽竊新知，附會舊説，盲人瞎馬，已入歧途，不足以言發揚舊醫學説也。</p>
<p>近年來，國内外醫藥專家，傾心研究國藥之空氣，至爲濃厚！國人中曾廣方博士，卽爲研究國藥所最努力者，曾氏現在上海自然科學研究所工作，據氏語人：「近人莫不知國藥有偉效，尤以人參認爲有强心作用，但人參之成分如何？藥理如何？尙昧知也。此非不能知不可曉者；因研究一藥，非數兩幾錢卽足爲研究材料，必有用至幾十斤或幾百斤者，試想人參用至百斤，價值已達鉅萬，環顧國内醫藥滿目荒凉，尙堪足言研究人參乎」？曾氏語重心長，吾人當知所悟。一年來舊醫藥界侈談研究國藥者，謂某藥已提精，某藥已明成分，直乃痴人説夢，不足徵也。</p>
<p>尙有一事，而深值吾人注意者，卽事國醫學敎育之畸形，猶在不斷發展。在此過渡期中，吾人不敢言舊醫學校不可設立，亦不敢言舊醫分子不能參加社會活動，此國民之權利，無人敢剥削者；但以敎育系統言，舊醫學校似不應躋入各大學府之林。二十三年冬，在上海舉行之獨立學院運動會，某舊醫學校，亦因學校資格，公然參加，無形中殆已承認舊醫學校，足爲近代中國大學之一。似上淆亂中國敎育法制，敎衣當局，豈可不注意及之。</p>
<h3>齒槽膿漏症之病原治療及預防法</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>齒槽膿漏症。（Pyorrhea　Alveolaris）爲口腔普通疾病之一種。患者甚多。爲害甚烈。其流出之膿液。吞入胃腸。可以引起全身各部疾病。如關節炎。胃潰瘍。腸潰瘍。肺炎。扁桃腺炎。膿性咽間炎。黄疽。膽石。腸炎及各種口炎等症。同時牙肉發炎腫痛。牙齒摇動。膿汁常流。口腔甚臭。令人憎惡。若遷延不治。必至影響健康。精神不振。面黄身瘦。且病勢進展。齒牙脱落。咀嚼爲艱。據美國某醫家之言。齒牙因此症喪失者較之因蝕蛙而喪失者爲夥。故此病實爲齒病中最有注意之價值者。爰於診餘。就管見所及。並參考近年最有效用之療法散見於雜誌各書者。草成此篇。以貢諸關心健康者。</p>
<p>病原</p>
<p>齒槽膿漏之源原甚多約分爲六項：</p>
<p>（一）　牙齒排列不齊。咬合不正。或所裝鑲之橋牙托牙不妥貼。因此咀嚼不便。齒牙因所受壓力過多及不平均以致漸漸受傷。而成此症。</p>
<p>（二）　因唾涎内所含之石灰質。及殘餘食物。黏附於齒齦部。或血液内所排洩之廢質包圍於齒格周圍（Calculus）因此刺激牙肉以致光血發炎。牙肉與牙齒分離而成一囊袋。齒行及污物愈聚愈多。同時齒根膜及齒槽骨亦受傷而破壞。</p>
<p>（三）　牙肉發炎分離後。膿菌及寄生物乘隙侵入作虐。</p>
<p>（四）　藥物中毒。如内服藥之含有水銀尿酸等。</p>
<p>（五）　口腔不潔。缺少洗刷。及喜吃硬物。</p>
<p>（六）　全身疾病如花柳病肺病糖尿病等。</p>
<p>齒槽膿漏症約可分爲甲乙丙三種。</p>
<p>甲種齒槽膿漏症　此症程度較淺。其症狀爲齒頸周圍牙肉。紅腫發炎。此蓋因許多由唾涎或血液而來之排洩物。結成黑硬齒石。黏附於齒牙周圍及齒槽間。成一環狀。因此刺激牙肉。致成紅腫。然牙肉多未形成囊袋。卽使有之亦甚淺小。膿汁或有或無。大概無者居多。下顎門牙裏面及上顎臼齒外面。最面黏附齒石。患者口腔狀况。顯示疏忽清潔衛生。</p>
<p>乙種齒槽漏症　此種眞正齒槽膿漏症。齒齦炎之症狀不甚明顯。牙肉不特不充血。反現貧血之狀。牙肉與齒牙分離而退縮。齒根膜破壞甚速。同時齒槽骨損傷縮短。囊袋較深。常發現於門牙。或臼齒齒槽間。膿汁常時流出。口腔甚臭。硬質齒石。或有或無。齒牙摇動。最後脱落。</p>
<p>丙種齒槽膿漏症　此症多由全身疾病所致。如花柳病肺病放綫菌病骨髓炎糖尿病流涎症燐中毒營養不良及新陳代謝等疾病。皆可爲病原。其症狀亦因其病原而異。如係花柳肺癆及骨髓炎所致。則齒槽骨劇烈破壞。進行甚速。因此齒牙摇動。硬質齒石。常發現於齒牙周圍。膿液常流。須長時間之治療。方可漸漸痊愈。如係糖尿病所發生者。則牙肉浮腫脹痛。齒根膜發炎。知覺過敏。血液結成之齒石。發現齒牙周圍。膿汁或有或無。如爲新陳代謝疾病所發生者。其症候變化無常。」</p>
<p>治療方法</p>
<p>（一）概論</p>
<p>齒槽膿漏症之治療方法。頗爲複雜。且須經長久之時間。及平時耐謹愼。方能收效。下列數條。病家與醫生雙方均須明瞭注意以免功虧一簣。事敗垂成。</p>
<p>（一）病家必須與醫生嚴密合作。絶對服從醫生之指導。處處留心。以期獲得永久之效果。</p>
<p>（二）　膿毒吞入胃内。吸收入血易發生全身疾病或竟起血中毒症。影響康健。非常重大。但病家對於膿毒。多漫不留意。惟惴惴於其齒牙之摇動脱落。此種心理。醫家宜注意之。</p>
<p>（三）　若齒根尖未曾發生變化。則適當之治療。可制止膿液。恢復虖齒之健康狀度。然牙齒之效用。終較病前爲遜色。</p>
<p>（四）　如事實上無法醫治之劇烈症候。則最好將齒牙拔去爲上策。不必再經過長久時期之治療。徒勞無功。反使病家失望。</p>
<p>（五）　關於日常飲食衛生方面。患者宜多飲水。稍帶鹹性飲料如蘇打水果子鹽等。間或飲之。亦頗有益。又大便不宜秘結。宜多食果蔬糙米等以刺激腸胃。凡糖餅及精製之糕麫等宜少食。食後。宜卽漱口。</p>
<p>（六）　齒槽膿漏症治之療法。約可分三種卽外科手術。藥物治療。及器械裝鑲。」</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十一）猩紅熱</p>
<p>命名－猩紅熱一症德人稱Scharlach。英人謂爲Scarlet　Fever。我國從前並没有聽見過什麽呌做猩紅熱。在古的醫書上。也没有這項病症的記載。更不知他是一種傳染病。一般人以爲本病所發的紅疹、頗像痧子。所以往往混稱爲痧子（或稱紅痧）。在中醫方面講起來。因爲本病大都合併咽喉症候。所以一般沿用喉痧，痧喉，爛喉痧，爛喉　痧等不同的名稱。其實他所論的證情。都是指着猩紅熱而言。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺説（三十七）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>鐵勃固靈五種反應的詳細情形已見上面見上面所述；至於他在診斷上的眞正價值，根據學理所估定的，也不妨在此處略述一二。第一，我我們要曉得，他對於所患是否爲本症症一節，在診斷上的助力，當然是不可磨滅的。至於現症的情形，如是否仍在進行，或已現停止狀態，病性範圍如何，侵潤面積之大小，這種種，是遠不及物理的檢查和Ｘ光的透視之凖確可靠的！第二，就單拿是否爲本症一節來説：他的反應之價值，也以陰性的比較陽性的來得大；就陽性反應來説：對於小孩的應用，係比較成人來得大。我們要曉得，結核病的傳染，差不多是無人能免的；就是終身無病之人，在他的嬰孩時代，當然是已被傳染過的，這在屍體解剖上都可以證明的。所以卽使發現陽性反應，在已被傳染過的人們，個個都屬可能的，對於現症上的診斷價值，不問可知是减少的了！根據這種學理，陰性反應對於非本症一層，係可結束此疑題的，當然是不可共語的；至於小孩和成人的比較，也可由此而推想了！</p>
<p>最後，對於自身尿反應試騐，近來也有人從事及此的。他的試騐手續，就是將病人自身的尿便，用注射的手續，注入數滴於皮内，以觀其局部反應的。此外，對於自身血清，自身汗液，均有類似之試騐的。但他們在診斷上的價值，迄今還是没有估定的；所以此處也只好節去不講以省冗漫了！</p>

<h3>美國市民的嘲笑者的馬克特温</h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>從一個漢尼巴（Hannib）的赤足野孩工的繁榮，不就是從殖民地地位中解放，一個密士失比（Mississippi）的船員，一個多年的流浪者走到了美國文壇最崇高的地位的馬克特溫（Mark　Twain），到今睥，恰恰誕生一百年了。</p>
<p>在馬克特溫以前，我們可以説美國没有自已的文學。不錯，我們知道美國有霍桑，有伊爾文，有愛倫坡，　但這些人都不過是英國文學的模倣者，英國傳統的承受者，由他們所構成的文學，並不是眞正的美國的，只是英國的支流：他們所要迎合的不是本國的讀者，而是倫敦的批評家，他們所描寫的不是粗野，豪邁的莽原開拓者，而是纖細，拘謹的沙龍紳士們。</p>
<p>可是，那些解放不久的市民們，終是不能滿足於此的，而且，大自然是那麽嘉惠他們，他們有溫和的氣候，廣漠的草原，神秘的處女林，美妙的密士失比，豐饒的加里佛尼亞金鑛，廉價的奴隷勞動，還有那多望的工商業發展的前途；他們的世界是黄金和歡喜，他們需要拓荒者的冒險精神，他們也需要笑，縱令是淺薄的笑，只要新鮮，只要潑刺，也正是他們所要求的。</p>
<p>他們也要求用初出的獵狗的新鋭的眼搜索世界，用輕淺的譏刺批判一切。</p>
<p>最初滿足他們這些要求的，不，最初反映他們這新的意識的就是馬克特溫，那充溢着輕淺的玩笑的他的最初的名作「馳名的跳蛙」（The　Celebrated　lumpingFrog）和帶着新奇的眼力的他的游記「海外的無知者」（Innocents　Abroad）所以能够極快地在農舍，在酒排間抓住了廣大的讀者，得着聖經一樣的銷路，决不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>馬克特溫自已便是一個新鮮蓬勃的人物，他的人格，他的作風都是當時美國的象徵；在一八七０年五月十日，正是他的「海外的無知者」得到最廣大的銷路的時候，正是他和蘭頓姑娘（Olivia　Langdon）結婚以後三月，他在寫給曾德拍斯Nevada的信上説他有「一位可愛的妻：一個可愛的屋，屋有迷人的裝飾；一輛可愛的馬車；和一個風采威儀簡直是可怕的動人的馬車夫——什麽也不缺乏，而且我賺的錢實在超過我的需要以上。」這是一個内華達（Nevada）負債的鑛工的繁榮，不就是從殖民地地位中解放出來，經過内戰，又獲得了勞動市塲的自由美國嗎？</p>
<p>他帶着邊疆的蓬勃的力，和幽默的諧調踏進文學，完全用他自已的粗糙的，常常誤拚的字句，依照他自已的新鋭的眼，表現着初民的冒險精神：對於歐洲一切，他也給了新的評價，他擺脱了傳統，背棄了權威，敎條Ｊaboo一點也不能的束他那騷動的熱情和輕快的譏刺。</p>
<p>「他譏刺什麽呢，這新興市民國家的文學寵兒？」也許有這樣的探問。</p>
<p>雖然是新興市民的國家，但是牠有舊的渣滓，也有新的發展着的毛病，因此，我們的笑的哲學家的譏刺的對象眞多，他有愛得生Ａddison蘭姆，密爾頓，卡萊爾等等大家的文學囚徒，他更有鄉村星期日學校的學監，學習了幾百個聖經功課的孩子，讚美着愛蒂夫人（Mrs.Ｅddy）的基督敎的科學家，頑固的莎士比亞專家，聖蹟尋掘者，猜着依照一般的原理一定會被人鑑賞的鑑賞家，引用着名人的「最後的話」而驕氣凌人的人，阿諛富人的美國人，成千整萬的只有言論没有行爲的卑微的人物，用他們的報紙，强姦到人的家裏來的厚顔的新聞家，確信的神學家，固執的「科學」牛皮客，居喪之際大張祝典的感傷家，行爲的無政府主義者，永遠引用着其他敎授們的話的敎授，發財得快的人，聰明得快的人，宗敎改革家。</p>
<p>在一切被他嘲弄的社會現象中，他投以最大的不敬的是宗敎，他説基督敎文明是殺人的文明，發明了最利的武器是基督敎最值得驕矜的勝利，他説「二三世紀以後，一定可以看一切合格的殺人犯都是基督敎徒」，在他的「三萬遺産」，（The　So,ooo　Bequest）裏，更有一個有味的描寫：「這是三個寒冷的天氣，當她把福音的貨物裝上船去的時候，這是去説服淺慮的中國人，呌他把二十四個純金孔敎來和膺造的基督敎交換的。</p>
<p>正和他反對一切偏頗的社會現象一樣，馬克特溫的反宗敎是多少帶粗糙，有些淺薄的。他不知道基督文明决不能再存在「二三世紀」。然而，毫無疑義，他的這種精神，却是把握了初期市民社會的進步的意識的。</p>
<h3>微笑（四）</h3>
<p>— 英國Lamernce著唐錫如譯</p>
<p>他們没有小孩，而他常常是傷感地需要孩子的，他覺得很悲哀。</p>
<p>現在她永遠不會回到他那兒去了，這是第十三次，她是永遠的去了。</p>
<p>不過這是她嗎？當他這樣想的時候，他覺得是她在他的肋骨什麽地方輕輕的觸着，使他微笑的，他把額角縐了一下，他臉上露出一副怒容來了。他不再微笑了！當他俯視着這個無限地使人發怒的死了的女人時，他咬緊了他的四方形的赤露的牙床，露出他的大顆的牙齒來。重又這樣了！」－他眞想學狄更司小説裏的人物，那麽對她説。</p>
<p>他自已一逕没有學好過，他並且預備讓他的許多缺點保存下去。</p>
<p>他突然回到那三個女人那方面去，她們已經退後到隠在燭光外面去了，現在在他和什麽地方中間，戴了她們的白頭巾在徘徊着。他的眼光閃耀着，他露出了他的牙齒。</p>
<p>「罪在我！罪在我！」他突的高聲叫了起來。</p>
<p>「Macche」那個受驚的修道院長叫了起來，她把她的兩隻手飛快伸出開來，然後重又袖在袖子裏，像是一對一同棲息在巢裏的小鳥似的。</p>
<p>馬太把他的頭點着，呆看着四週，預備跑出去，修道院長在後邊低低地誦着一首讚美詩，她的念珠在摇擺着，那個蒼白的年青尼姑退得更後些，不過那個壯健的，黑色的，深思遠慮的尼姑，像是個永世幽默的星星，在他頭上䀹着眼，他重又覺得那微笑在他肋骨那兒觸癢着了。</p>
<p>「聽哪」！他忠告地對這幾個女人説，「我我現在是異樣的反常，我想我還是走開的好」。</p>
<h3>辨字與辨詞（三）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>主——好，我們就從蘇明允和蘇子由的六國論説起。古文辭類纂選蘇明允權書八（六國），題下加三圈（古文辭類纂題下加圈以别優劣。）劉海峰評曰：「筆力簡老」，蘇子由六國論，題下加兩圈，蕭縣徐氏刻本眉評云：「熟於當時形勢之談」。可見這兩篇六國論，原是桐城派諸前輩所最贊許的。六國的史事具在，我們就史論史，明允和子由的論議，那一派胡説，我們能首肯嗎？六國爲什麽會衰亡？秦爲什麽能够統一？從民族上講，這是混合成熟後必然的趨勢；從周初到春秋，從春秋到戰國，大魚吃小魚，大蟲吃小蟲，各部落各諸侯的消長興亡，没有一天停止過。六國所以衰亡，和八百諸侯的衰亡過程並没半點不同；秦所以强盛，所以統一，和戰國七雄所以强盛所以局部統一，也没半點不同。從經濟上講，農業經濟的發達，决定一國的國運；秦自從商鞅執政，實行土地私有，奬勵多量生産，以富饒的關中來侵略農産落後（貴族佔有土地，生産方法落後）的六國，勝負不問可知。以政治思想和組織論，儒家墨家法家都趨向集中政權足食足兵的政治觀，六國政權爲貴族所反持，什麽事都不能有計劃的改革。法家在秦國當權，减削權門，集中政權於中央，實行足食足兵的計劃，自然戰無不利，攻無不克。蘇明允和蘇子由的六國論，可會半點搔着癢處？他們説：「六國破滅，非兵不利，戰不善，弊在賂秦；賂秦而力虧，破滅之道也！」（蘇明允六國）説：「夫秦之所與諸侯爭天下者，不在齊楚燕趙也，而在韓魏之郊；諸侯之所與秦爭天下者，不在齊楚燕趙也，而在韓魏之野。…夫韓魏諸侯之障，而使秦人得出入於其間，此豈知天下之勢耶」：（蘇子由六國論）豈不是和小學生的案頭史論一樣幼稚嗎？現代青年稍微讀過文化史社會史，會發這樣可笑的議論嗎？古文名家理論會這樣不通，無怪甲午年間，有翰林出身的御史要奏稱：「日本國北邊有兩大强國，暹羅和緬甸，國富兵强，請皇上派使修好，南北夾攻，可制日本的死命」了。老兄若願意把現代青年的論文，來和唐宋八大家的論文仔細比一比，你就會覺得無論哲學，社會，自然，各方面都比較進步得多了，至少可以説正確得多了。</p>
<p>客——那末，請你再從組織方面再比較一下罷：</p>
<p>主——中國古代文人只有文集，文集猶如現有雜誌，上天下地，無所不談，昨是今非，先後矛盾，很少有組織的。先秦諸子，比較有組織；也只莊子，苟子，韓非子説得上有并然的統系。秦漢以後，只有王充論衡，劉　文心雕龍，劉知幾史通，章實齋文史通義比較有組織；即如汪中那麽一個大作家，他的述學便是十景拚盤，説不上有組織的了。又如韓愈的原道，正是「儒言不勝，而取給於氣矜，游　怒特，蹂稼踐蔬，卒之數篇之中，自爲錯誤。」（章太炎語）韓退之根本不懂道家的主張，又不懂佛家的主張，更不懂道佛兩家的同異，究言之，他連儒家的主張還不十分清楚；因此組織不成一個完整的理論，寫不成一篇完整的文章。原道那麽有名的文章都這樣不成話，其他那些濫古文更不必説了。現代青年無論如何要不得，至少受過一點邏輯的訓練，看過一點歐美的論文，决不會和韓退之那樣前言不對後語的。别的不必説，老兄只要把桐城派那些作家看一看，可有一個作家能像嚴幾道那樣做得周密，能像林紓那樣做得生動？而且林紓自已的作品可有一篇及得他自已的譯作？而且章士釗講輯文學時，文章就有生氣；一鑽入牛角尖去復古，文章便十有九不通。再加一個一而且」，凡是受過西洋文學的洗禮的，無不顯出特色來。「章太炎的論文，受佛學的影響甚深，亦非從唐宋古文中出來。）所以就組織方面來講，現代青年也比别人進步得多，至少比唐宋古文家周密得多。</p>
<p>客——你這樣尊今抑古，固然能持之有故，言之成理；但我仍不十分明白，爲何讀古人的文章總覺得比今人好得多呢？</p>
<p>主——這是你的傳統思想在作怪呀：唐擘黄先生説得好：「古則雅，今則俗，人之常情。愈古的東西，就覺得他愈雅，文字也不能逃出此例之外。這事的原因很複雜；一由於古物之難得：物罕則見珍，見珍則雅。彞器如此，文字也這樣。二由於後人往往把古代加以理想化；我們不見古人，每每想像他的生活進於理想；所以黄金時代必在上古。三由於今人的語言，因其爲日常所通用，往往使我們聯想到現世的具體的情境——許多不滿意的不純潔的事情。古人的文字，因爲與現行語言不同，不會生這樣連想，所以我們覺得他比較地不俚俗。這種古則雅，今則俗的心理作用，使你常常覺得讀古人的文章比今人好得多。恕我説句笑話，當你覺得古人的文章格外好，你實在還没看懂古人的文章呢！前人不懂尙書，把盤庚看作寳文章；今人不懂八股，有人也把那種臭濫調當作好文章；一旦看懂了，就不愛那勞什子了！時代總是前進的，我若是做了古人，必希望後人的文章比我更進步，一代好似一代，才是文化前進的大路；現代青年的國文程度，若眞江河日下，一代不如一代，後代的人都變成笨伯，做古人的也有什麽光榮呢？</p>
<h3>一男一女</h3>

<p>清早晨。</p>
<p>未曾走上橋頭，便看到河岸上黑壓壓地擠滿了人。等我定上橋頭，也不禁停着脚步，在嘈雜嘻笑的人聲中，和他們一樣地把目光抛向同一焦點。</p>
<p>這條水，是大清河的一條支流，普稱呌作小清河，水極清潔，碧澄明潤，一線波紋追着一線波紋地，在深褐色並不寛闊的河身裏長流着，永遠是那麽紆徐。朝陽映着靠橋頭停泊的蜈蚣船，留在水心裏的是極柔軟的像蛇一般的影子。在遥遠處，載浮載沉地飄來一具很龐大的屍身，像隻剥了皮的牛。</p>
<p>人羣廛起了種種的聲音：</p>
<p>「莫不是上游又發了水——河水並没有混啊。……」</p>
<p>「那裏會是人，人有這麽大？」……</p>
<p>「有那麽傻的，牲口摔到河裏不喂人，……」</p>
<p>橋頭岸傍的人越來越多了。河東的，河西的，這是交通的要道。挑担的，提籃的，一個一個的黄泥腿，穿着淡到發光的布衫子，擁擠着開路。後面的間前面：「怎麽啦，有跳河的！」前面的不答腔，更用力的擠。</p>
<p>河中央，屍首順着水流，種破了波紋，起起落落地。較近些，是看得清楚了。這時候，年表的小夥子臉皮紅紅的，眉開眼笑了，意想不到的呌出聲來：</p>
<p>「嘿－一男一女！」</p>
<p>蜈蚣船頭站着看熱閙婦女們，臉皮也跟着紅起來，啐一口吐沫，可是很依戀的再狠狠看一眼，然後陸續地轉進艙去，一面喊着自已孩子貓或狗，「進來，進來，别髒了眼！」</p>
<p>「這眞是什麽世道，」老年人在嘆息了，「出這種醜！」</p>
<p>我看到那屍身漸漸地向橋身流過來。的確是的，一男一女被緊緊地，面對面的縳在一起。屍體在水裏有了相當時候，河水滲透進他們的每個細胞，人是腫得像牛一般癕腫。向例，水是飄浮着的屍體是仰着流，可是現在因爲兩個人的平衡不一致，在水而上，稍稍受一點激動，便輾轉一下。</p>
<p>「嘻－嘻－嘻。」每個年青人都是高興的。「還動呢！」</p>
<p>屍身緩缓地在蜈蚣船中的河心過。人們，是在嘈雜地討論着這兩個年青人犯罪的原因。人們，都是袖着手，没有一個提議去搭救或掩埋。我知道，這種事情近於「暈」，船家有時恐怕冲破了好運氣，若是孤身人，一定早有慈善家了。</p>
<p>屍身到了橋邊，那男人的臉正仰上，看到了那臉，在我記憶裏很熟悉的一擊，是的，我是認識這一張臉子的，雖然現在是漲大，是慘白。要看到他額上那塊疤，我就知道是他，雖然一時，我呌不出他的名字。</p>
<p>於是我便怱怱地擠下橋頭找尤二，尤二，這個老船夫，已經是絶户了，我想，他大概是不會忌諱這事情的。在人圍中找到他，我説：</p>
<p>「你積點德，老二，打撈上來，找人埋了他，錢到我那邊去拿！」</p>
<p>尤二把旱烟袋揷在腰裏答應了。</p>
<p>「到底是學堂的先生行好事，」一些路人歌頌起我來，「太陽底下，給大男小女看這些傷風敗俗，眞不是事！」</p>
<p>日頭很高了，我從小學堂回來，看見人已經到了棺材裏。尤老二説，」就讓他兩躺在一口棺吧，」我這時，又看清了那女人的面目。我心裏明白，我不獨認識那男的，我也認識這女的。他們，是我在大清河上游辦民衆學校時候的第一班學生，也是我的帮手。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>中國是世界之中國</h3>
<p>— 鐵蒂</p>
<p>據外論通訊社稿載，德國柏士曼敎授來華研究中國古代建築藝術消息。柏氏係專門研究建築學術之學者，一九０九年以前曾至中國，復於一九三三年再次來華，復開始作中國之研究。今如一月八日乘薩爾布吕根號回國，其間經過十五個月，歷訪十三省。半爲研究中國古代尤其宗敎之建築術，尤其是寺院與塔。半爲研究中國建築在變遷時代中之革新與改造。連帶研究中國之農人及其住宅，觀察新舊之藝術，尤其都市建築方面者。</p>
<p>由上面一段消息，看來也好像是使人歡喜的，何以呢？有些人以爲我國的建築的確是在進步的。比如柏氏之來華，這可作個好例子吧，其實並不是這樣。</p>
<p>我國的建築果眞是已進步了吧？不是，在表面上看，雖有十幾二十多層的洋房出現，其實，這些功勞並不完全是屬於我們的，站在指導的位子上還是帝國主義國家的代表者，換句話説，一切的權利，都是被操縱在他們的手裏。</p>
<p>那麽，我們旣明瞭這些意義，比如這次柏氏之來華，他是爲了一些甚麽呢？質言之，他也是代表帝國主義者之一個，他來研究中國的建築，其目的並不在供給他研究的材料，而是在法意我國一切建築的現象，想來計劃一切，換句話説，就是來計劃將來獨占的先聲！</p>
<p>在這種變動的時代裏，帝國主義感到牠自身會發生動摇了，所以她們就互相排擠，你推我奪，結果，她們不能在這種環境裏取得勝利，如是就發狂般地向殖民地或半殖民地去發展，想在這種塲合裏能尋得她們理想中的東西。</p>
<p>柏氏之來華，她的使命是在那一點呢？當然，他是不能脱離帝國主義的氛圍，因此，可知他來華的使命是負有重大意義的。由此，大家也感到中國是世界之中國嗎！</p>
<h3>冬</h3>
<p>— 代尼</p>
<p>冬日的晚上是寂寞的</p>
<p>從野外歸來，黄昏爬在斗室的每一個角落裏，懶得去扭電燈的開關－其實這十六支燭光的電燈，開亮了或者更要顯出黄昏的幽黯，使人感到一種低氣的壓迫。脱下冬大衣，把疲乏的身體投在沙發裏，就那樣伸直了腿，像一個長途的旅人投進了小宿店一樣，他所需要的只是休息了。</p>
<p>没有思慮，恍惚地合着眼，把一切音響隔離在我的聽覺之外，然而並不是睡熟，如果有人如我期待着似的闖進來，我能够在他第一脚踏進的時候馬上跳起身來。</p>
<p>但是我不敢希望，冬日的晚上是寂寞的；這裏没有吐着熊熊火燄的壁爐，没有濃郁的咖啡，更没有妖媚的女人，像大厦高樓中的生活一樣，把冬日的晚上逍逝在滿室生春的氣氛中。</p>
<p>説是没有思慮，思潮却似一個討厭的債權人，毫不留情的闖入了：想起我們也有一個火盆的時候。</p>
<p>是大雪紛飛的午夜，挾了我的情婦跳出封建勢力如毒燄迷漫着的故鄉。一夜没有停息的奔走，天明時候到了朋友之家－一個小村落中的三間茅屋。</p>
<p>撲去了身上壓得厚厚的雪花，倒在火盆旁的竹椅内，身體是疲乏得不能再支持了，可是精神是興奮着。一邊烤着麫包充飢，互相對視着在火光中的每一張含着微笑的臉；記得被火燄炙傷了我們的脚底才驚破了靜穆的空氣。</p>
<p>這樣，我們把每個冬日的晚上消逝在火盆之旁。可是這種享受在海燕歸來的時候像冬日一樣被春之神驅走了。</p>
<p>從此，我没有了家鄉，帶着創傷的脚底走遍天南地北，過着無數寂寞的冬日底晚上。</p>
<p>這難忘的影像在我休息的時候馬上重現到我的眼前，於是我睜開眼來，眼前是一片黑暗，祗有行脚僧的木魚聲橐的從遠而近，流浪人呵，你有什麽希圖呢？</p>
<p>從黑暗中站起身來，摸索着牆壁上電燈的開關，十六支燭光的燈亮把我修長的影子投在門外，像一條蟄居着的蛇。</p>
<p>向黑暗的甬道中注視着，我迫切的希望有一個不速的來客分擔我無謂的煩惱，卽使眞是債權人，我也一定欵爲上賓，但是這一點希望如木魚聲指示我的－這世界是空虚的。</p>
<p>從這角落到那角落，來回地踱着步，孤獨的影子昏亂的在四面牆壁上幌動，就像發見了一個疑難的答案，把失了平匀的思潮寄托在牠的動態中，忘了隠隠作痛的創傷底脚底。</p>
<p>終於一股氷冷的空氣從脚跟襲上身來，而第一聲的鷄啼和橐橐的木魚聲同時響了起來，我抬起失神的眼珠向窗外望去，一片白色的反射光，對街的屋頂上舖着棉絮一般的厚雪，腦海裏似乎也被掃滌了乾凈。開了窗，吸了一口深長的冷氣。</p>
<p>「一個寂寞的冬日之夜送走了！」自語着。</p>
<p>「但是今夜的黄昏呢？」自已反問。</p>
<p>「冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎！」一個聲音回答我。</p>
<p>可是春天呵，是海燕歸來的季節啊！</p>
<h3>南海上的天國</h3>
<p>— 三郎</p>
<p>「　斗門是南海面的天國呀！」</p>
<p>斗門的名字是那麽迷人的，他是南海上的一個小島，從澳門搭船去也要十個鐘頭的水程。去年，我流浪到哪兒去。</p>
<p>斗門確是我想象里那麽的奇蹟呵！高高疊疊的山峯，蜿蜒地。從海面上瞧過去是一幅美麗的畫圖，迷人的景緻，半熱帶的森林，鬱鬱地茂盛着，蘊藏着溫柔和可愛的氣息，浸透了帶着悲哀的調子的旅人底心膛。</p>
<p>雖然斗門没有偉大的都市底建築物，没有黑暗塲面的賣淫婦，可是，那兒却到處地顯着給官兵蹂躏過的傷創！深深地把我底思潮激盪着！看呵，這小島</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>里的人們没掉自由，没掉生的慾望，那時適是經過一塲旱災的時候，什麽耕種的東西都是枯死了。收穫少了。可是，官兵却還要加抽護河税，每畝多六角。天呀！他們的生命却在暴政的劊子手裏叫。在斗門，我聽見一個老頭子説斗門的故事：</p>
<p>「在十多年前，這里還是水賊國呢。官兵也没有辦法，因爲水賊大都是本地人，精悍勇敢，爲了吃，什麽都可以幹，可以拚命的。幾年的戰爭，兩方面都有戰艦，那麽眞起勁呀。然而，終是平靜了，換過一批官兵來，老百姓的生活更是苦煞呢。什麽捐呀！税呀！收穫以後還要抽了一大部分榖糧去。這樣的生活，倒不如十多年以前了。」</p>
<p>斗門的人們都是那麽地歎息着呢。怱促的調子，痛苦的咆哮，給我一個永不可磨滅的深刻的印象：</p>
<p>「南海上的斗門已不是天國了！」</p>
<p>斗門的鄉村是那麽幽美的，很少是新時代的建築物，人們的生活方式還是保持着老舊的，不過，這小島早已開闢了幾條長長的公路，把島的東西南北都連貫起來，還有許多舊式的汽車在咆哮地奔跑着。然而，鄉村里的人們也感不到什麽驚異了，他們已受到了大都市的影響，他們已嚐過許多異樣的滋味。他們早已給從都市來的剥削者們鞭笞著。他們已在痛苦的生活里进出勇氣來了，他們要求的是生活哪。爲了這幾年來的斗門發生了許多次老百姓和官兵肉搏的事情來，我到哪兒旅行去的時候正是一塲激烈的血毆，以後不久。深重的傷創還是那麽明顯地現在我的眼前呢。</p>
<p>斗門雖是蘊藏着迷人的氣息的小島，有美麗的風景有可愛的精悍的人們，然而，我終是帶着失望的調子走了。</p>
<p>「斗門已不是南海上的天國了，到處已露着曾蹂躪過的傷創呢。」</p>
<h3>在大江上</h3>
<p>— 梁啓筠</p>
<p>一大羣的鴨子循着江邊向下游飄流着；趕鴨子的老范坐在一隻大木桶裏，跟在後面統率着　這江湖飄泊的人，就是這樣的隨着鴨羣飄流的呵！</p>
<p>已是日暮了。</p>
<p>蒼茫的山嶺，被灰黯的天幕壓抑着的蒼茫的山嶺，在由稀薄而漸濃厚的暮靄裏佇立着，低垂着頭，一陣不很稠密的黑點子瀰漫地飛過山嶺了，是一羣趕着歸巢的老鴉子，嘹喨的戞然的長鳴遺留在天空中，盪漾着，繚繞着。呵，那歸鳥的鳴聲，在這流浪人的耳中是多麽的悒鬱，多麽的悲愴啊！</p>
<p>因了，這寂寞的空間裏，這充滿了暮氣的寂寞的空間裏，除了歸鳥，山嶺，鴨子，和一個單獨的趕鴨人之外；就祗有低唱着流水曲的江水，伴着晚秋的微寒的晚風。于是，這偶然發出來的鳴聲，對于他——這個江湖的飄泊者——至少，也會感覺到一點兒慰藉，一點兒溫熱呢。</p>
<p>山嶺流過去了。</p>
<p>接連，前面又延展開片一枯黄色的草原。在遼遠的邊際裏，那灰黯的天幔和那片一單調的枯黄色，祗隔着一道不很顯明的，糢糊的黑線。</p>
<p>那邊。距離得較遠的那邊的岸上，仍舊是連綿不斷的山嶺；不過，黄昏的黑暗已開始把牠們吞没着了。</p>
<p>于是，這飄流着的老范的心中，便充滿了悒鬱，悲哀，和不知所以的空虚。正像這遼闊的江面，和這廣闊的天空之間的，漫騰着的暮是靄一般。</p>
<p>鴨羣有一兩隻走散了，他忙把竹竿把牠趕回。這羣無知的鴨子，也就靜穆地馴伏地聽着那江水的「進行曲」。</p>
<p>遠處的港没間，幾支船桅矗立在糢糊裏。朦朧中，幾點微明的亮光在發着抖。眼前看見歸宿的所在將要到達了，這顆悵惘的寂寞的心，于是，便泛起了熱切的冀望。</p>
<p>頓時，感覺到興奮起來了。</p>
<p>那光明的歸宿呵！</p>
<p>那飄泊者疲倦了一整天的安息，已經是曙光般的出現了。</p>
<h3>做人家</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>做人家三字，現在提起，似頗覺腐化可笑了，做人家三字的意義，便是節儉經濟的意思，話起做人家，我便想到爾樁事情。</p>
<p>儒林外史裏的嚴監生，挣了十多萬的家私，他臨終的時候，喉嚨裏痰一進一出。一聲不到一聲，總不得斷氣，還把手從被單裏拿出來，伸着兩個指頭，傍人多猜不出他的意思，只有他的一位如夫人趙氏，知道他的心事，把燈盞裏點的兩莖燈草，挑掉一莖，嚴監生方才放心，點一點頭，把手垂下，頓時就没了氣。</p>
<p>我鄉有位老太太，今年差不多八九十歲了，她在早年，衣食不周，寒苦萬狀，現在居然敎子成名，也積下了數十萬的家私，她有治家的兩句格言，「啥敎啥不好意思，啥敎啥不在乎此」，這兩句話，初看似極平凡，但細味之，極有至理，所謂啥敎啥不好意思者，是對於一切支出而言，支出之費，天然能省則省師不能省而彼或亦省，卽使不得已而支出，亦必用極少數或極微之物給人，傍人必定説不好意思，而彼則極端反對曰，「啥敎啥不好意思」所謂啥敎啥不在乎此者，是對於一切收入而言，無論一絲一毫，不肯輕易放過，傍人必定説不在乎此，彼亦决不贊成，説「啥敎啥不在乎此」。</p>
<p>這兩種做人家的方法，確眞太猥瑣，太可笑了，但從前的人家，的確從這樣的做起很多，因爲從前的人，自奉甚薄，而所願不奢，所以古人有句話，「入千錢，出不止千錢，雖富亦貧，入一錢，出不及一錢，雖貧亦富」，現在是社交世界，物質文明，習尙奢侈，倘再有這樣做人，就是「拿了鋸子走路，走一步截一步」萬萬做不得人。</p>
<p>現代的思想和環境，絶對與從前不同，物質欲非常亢進，生活務求舒適，所以一般腦筋中，祗有安樂，寫意，漂亮，時髦，洋房汽車，高官厚禄，嬌妻美妾，天天在腦筋中打盤旋，這種奢望，自然不易達到目的，故志意薄弱的，一變而爲無聊，煩悶，抑鬱，困頓，消極，自殺，意志堅强的，則挺而走險，作奸犯科，無事不可爲，故青年生在現在時代，實在非常危險，環境的誘惑，希望的偉大，而生活之路，日見逼窄，故爲現代青年的人，祗有屏絶欲念，埋頭苦幹，方有出路，所謂「吃得苦中苦。方爲人上人」，否則便是死路一條。</p>
<h3>迷途</h3>
<p>— 浪人</p>
<p>從大地那裏誕生了的一顆赤熱的心，而今，可在人間的旅程上迷途了。</p>
<p>帶着這顆活躍着的心，隨着母親賦與的軀殻，一同走過了人世。我歷盡了荆棘，渡過了廣大的沙漠，也爬翻了高峻的山嶺。然而人間所給我的是什麽？世界帶給我的又是什麽味兒呢？</p>
<p>世界顯給我的是一個殘暴的臉孔，人間示給我以一個冷　的面相。赤熱的心被尖刺的人生所殺戮，鮮紅的血被社會所吸榨。</p>
<p>遺剩來的是孤苦與寂寞。——一個榨乾了的心的標本。</p>
<p>屢曾奮不顧身，想打破圍困着我的一個個的黑暗的網結；然而網結却越纒越緊。也會拚着全身心的精力去抗拒那個兇暴的臉孔，然而兇相的逼來却越來越近。……</p>
<p>每每是：一個幻滅才經過去，而另一個碰壁又來。黑暗像無底的深淵，而滿佈在眼前的沙洲竟會廣闊得毫無邊際。</p>
<p>在失敗的哀傷中我失去了勇氣，在屢次的踣蹶中我弄得渾身無力。燙熱的血已經漸在冷却，而血的環流也像將近涸竭。</p>
<p>從遍身的傷痕中我勉强爬起來，舉頭一望：圍繞在身邊的還是漫無涯際的沙漠，而前途却是一絲光綫都看不見。濃霧是層層的包圍，風雹永遠向我攻擊。</p>
<p>呵，何處有光明呢？什麽地方才有水泉的綠洲呀！</p>
<p>還是讓熱血和赤心埋葬在這荒郊吧？還是從迷途中找出路兒來呢？</p>
<p>然而，路在那兒呀？供給着我的心血的資源又在那兒呢？</p>
<p>大地呵，請您把您誕生的赤心從迷途裏帶出來吧！大地呵，你的兒子現在已成爲迷途裏的小羔羊了！</p>

<h3>駱駝之涙</h3>
<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>（曳著滯重的步趾，在遼闊的沙漠里，駱駝之羣永遠在漫長的旅程中前進，雖説，黄沙像霧一樣地籠者，看不見青的草，澄碧的水，而刀子似的北極風，蒙古人的有勁的鞭子，以及那重得難以支持的貨物，儘那結實的駱駝消受，以一份毅力，與一份吃苦的精神，忍耐地，一步一步，踏過荒凉的沙漠地。　駱駝是没有眼涙的，因爲牠曉得忍耐是一椿不可缺少的本領。）</p>
<p>曾經蟄居在西子湖裏的山寺中的年青人，他是没有家的，流浪的足跡，踏遍珠江流域的城子，也曾踏過故都的每一條衚衕，然而，他又有一些甚麽呢？他是一個無家可歸的流浪人，任生活的鞭子驅策着，正如一頭駱駝的旅程，决定的權力是操諸駕馭者之手一樣。</p>
<p>軟膩的湖風，是挽不住一顆流浪者之心的，終於，他是被一長隊的滬杭列車帶走，又被遺棄在霓虹燈的色澤所渲染着的市里，而他的闌珊的步趾，拖過瀝青大道，拖過崎嶇狹巷，幸運地他是以最低的代價出賣腦汁了。</p>
<p>生活的圈子箍緊了流浪的年青人的行止，於是，他如一匹駱駝一樣地，在沙漠似的生之旅程中，讓漫長的漫長的時間，支配了他的青春的歡娱，而葡匐地曳着滯重的步趾，含着人生的苦涙，一步一步踏上荒凉的生之旅途。</p>
<p>是的，他曾以最大的忍耐，接受着生活的皮鞭，然而，當他攬鏡自照，瞅着那瘦損的三角臉，以及那蕪草一樣的鬍髭的時候，他是不禁嘆息了，他猛的抓住了穿在身上的，敝舊的藍布大褂，他是燃起了一炬憤怒的火，可是，現實是鐵一樣的黑手，牠熄滅了他的憤怒，使他不能不俯首於現制度的桎梏下，像馴服的羔羊一樣地，吊下了眼涙，這眼涙，是他曾經以較多的時間所保持過的，而他，畢竟是流下了眼涙。</p>
<p>（躑躅在沙漠地的駱駝，是有着一份毅力，與一份吃苦的精神的，然而，北極風刮着牠的棕褐的毛，蒙古人的皮鞭抽打着牠的腿子，重量的貨物壓遍了牠的肉峯，這時候，駱駝也會涔涔地流下了凄苦的涙的。）</p>
<h3>不會排隊的國民</h3>
<p>— 高翰</p>
<p>前幾天，因爲家中有事，回××去。到北站，爲時尙早，還没有開始賣票，我在窗洞口等候着。人是照例十分擁擠；你推我擠地搶着先。後來，一聲開始賣票了。於是我和衆人一樣，像拼性命似地擠着，好容易把車票買到了手，並且和衆人一樣，像競走似地上了車。而正當我搶了一個靠窗的位置，坐定下來，如釋重負地透了一口氣時，一摸口袋，我愛用了四年的一隻掛錶，是不見了。</p>
<p>因此，我有了一次不愉快的旅行。我獨自懊惱着，一邊在腦裏想着這樣那樣的事，並且不斷地以充滿着憤怒的眼光狠狠看那茫然坐着的我前面的乘客，和呌賣各色零食的小販。無疑地，我是把所有這車廂裏的人，當做了敵人。</p>
<p>不會排隊的國民－－－我像是暗暗在那裏駡什麽人似地獨語了。</p>
<p>關於中國人的不會排隊的特性，恐怕誰都深感到的吧？無論在車站，在戲院，在會塲－－總之一切公衆地方，中國人都是不肯保持秩序，「魚貫」地出入的。也許有人以爲這習氣是無關緊要的事吧；但是我却在這裏面看到了更嚴重的意義。</p>
<p>「各人自掃門前雪，休管他家瓦上霜。」這兩句話，是中國人處世上的金科玉律。但是實際上，這裏面是包含着什麽意義呢？這就是呌你只要自顧自，永遠莫管人家怎樣。前次有人在亞爾培路被暴徒槍殺時，奔去捕房報告的，不是死者的同胞，而是一個異籍的我國人：在報上看到這段記事，我們是不能不感慨系之的。而在國外的華僑，因爲不懂同舟共濟，而慘敗於外國有組織的商人之手的，不也是害在這種處世哲學上面嗎？</p>
<p>一些外國人，是很知道中國人的這種「毛病」的：所以他們對付中國人，慣用煽動内爭和各個擊破的兩種方法。請把一部現代中國衰微史，細細研究一下吧！</p>
<p>但是中國人是永遠不肯放棄他們的自以爲聰明，自以爲對自已有利的念頭的。倘若有一天中國竟致亡國，那一定就亡在這種「毛病」上的無疑！</p>
<p>而不肯排隊，若一細想，不正是這「毛病」最顯明的表現嗎？</p>

<p>開篇「海上名媛」</p>
<p>佳人獨自在香房。斜倚凉床俏面龐。兩眼惺忪尙帶倦。連連呼欠懶洋洋。釧兒翡翠晶瑩碧。映着那雪白的飢膚白似霜。嬌姿婉比鮮花樣。雨滴牡丹春海棠。啓口聲聲女使喚。欲思梳洗要香湯。霎時走進年輕婢。倒水煎茶侍奉忙。她起床盥。洗調脂粉。一時滿室覺生香。菱花鏡裏花容照。直照得瑕疵毫無意氣揚。她整理一番身疲倦。白金龍吸着走臨窗。旁邊開動電風扇。頓刻清風遍體凉。吩咐一聲開那無綫電。靜聽唱片樂無央。有的是唱申曲。有的是唱雙簧。有的是唱京戲。有的是唱崑腔。無非北調與南腔。好聽之時微笑着。聽到俏皮要駡一聲。她靜氣息心多寫意。丫頭送進燕窩湯。白木耳一碗外加糖。午後相邀小姊妹。中風白板碰麻將。到得夜來因覺熱。兜風摩託去乘風凉。這也是。天生福氣勝尋常。</p>

<p>風流天子賦西巡。策馬長途得意行。山東過去山西近。野草閒花處處新。偶宿梅龍小鎭上。見當爐女子態娉婷。好比春化含曉露。如同秋月長精神。想吾是三宫六院嬪妃廣。如此豐姿見未曾。果然　貧賤出傾城。啓金口。喚玉人。有屈卿卿把酒斟。家世姓名仔細問。可喜他預將鳳字作佳名。酒落快腸情倍切。不備此身萬乘尊。欲要襲王會雨雲。那知小家女偏有凌雲志。聞戲言含怒閉房門。鍾情天子心難捨。現出龍袍耀眼睛。迎眸看。頓吃驚。不問可知即帝君。慌忙跪到塵埃地。口口聲聲萬歲稱。當今一笑携雙手。封作西宫沐帝恩。雙雙同返紫金城。</p>

<h3>響應着時代的需求麗都大戲院將完成</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>上海，是東方的巴黎！擁有的是二十世紀最新式都市所具有的一切。林立的煙突，擾攘的車馬，忙碌的人們；終日在工作着，腦筋在運用着。在這種情形之下，要在公餘，得到一種高尙的娱樂，除了電影院就簡直没有更爲適合的地方，而我們所急切需要的，尤其是第一輪影片的戲院。</p>
<p>上海，也是東方的紐約，是繁奢，華麗，富产同巨賈的安樂窩，要人政客的遊樂地，遍地黄金，所謂第二輪電影院，似乎並不需要。但是以上海之大，三百多萬的人中，到底有幾多是富商，巨賈，政客，要人？他們祗是極少數而已！這樣看來，第一輪電影院的觀客除了富有者外，其餘的多是因爲適合時代的第二輪影院的缺乏，或者所享受的與所付出的代價相差太大的緣故。故我們所主張急切需要的第二輪電影院是應該具有第一輪電影院所有的設備，而祗需擔負一半的代價。使人們共有的得到娱快身心的機會。務使達到設備舒適，價目低廉的實踐。現在貴州路北京路角行將建築工竣之麗都大戲院，其設備的華貴堂皇，對於第一輪之電影院實有過之而不及。</p>
<p>麗都大戲院的建築，是整個的立體式。一切的圖案，色澤，設計，配置，甚至地上的圖樣備置，都無不經過專家的考慮過。</p>
<p>有聲電影，當然聲音是應該特别的注意。現在麗都所購置的發聲機，是西電公司的出品，當然，這是最滿意的聲機，但是爲着保證發音起見，竟費去巨量金錢，購買不燃正音紙版Celotex鑲在牆上以吸收音浪，使得没有回聲的弊病。本埠電影院中有此設備者，除了大上海之外　，就祗有麗都了。同時麗都的放映機。其不線之充足除了三數家第一輪影院之外，恐怕没有能够比得牠上的。</p>
<p>至於座位的設備，我們更應該注意了。兩小時的觀影時間，我們實在不願受以肉體上的痛苦。現在麗都全院所採用的是彈簧座墊，其高低之通度和地位的寛舒，都在在使我們滿意的。除了一切華麗舒適以外，牠要收的代價極低以第一輪電影院的設備而祗收一半的代價，我恐怕祗有麗都吧！</p>
<p>對於管理的一方面，在有廿餘年電影院經騐者管理之下，觀客們的安存和舒適，實在是可以保證的事實。</p>
<p>麗都快要開幕了，我們期待着吧！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「疑雲情深」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Beady　for　Love　大光明</p>
<p>因偶然的誤會，以訛傳訛地廣播開去，而又被加油添醬地形成一種所謂「輿論」，一塲熱閙，弄得當事人在莫名其妙中演成許多悲喜劇的故事，這原是很戲劇性的。愛爾蘭女作家葛利哥萊的「市虎」一譯「謡傳」就是用這些題材作成的有名劇本。可是作者對於這種事件，若不從牠的社會意義上去批判地着眼的話，那末無論事件的本身如何離奇有趣，作者的手法又怎樣的靈巧美妙，所作成的東西，終不免是這麽一回事而已。</p>
<p>「疑雲情深」就是這類的例子。他寫一位妙齡女郎曼麗珂，因失去了心愛的小狗而哭泣，被人們誤會是當時舉行喪禮而不名譽的某浪蕩者的情婦，於是弄得滿城風雨地爲衆人所不齒。婦女們在假道學的假面具下妒忌她，鄙視她。但舞塲經理，戲院老　們却把她當作發財工具地來以重金聘請。</p>
<p>在「黄色新聞」隨着這動亂，苦悶的社會，特别爲一般小市民們所歡迎的現在，針對着某些人的「佈置强姦案」，「僞造訴訟案」等事實，劇作者能强調地在曼麗珂之不幸的遭遇上，暴露而諷刺地來處理牠的時候，未始不可以製成有意義的影片的。可時劇作者祗俗套地着重在曼麗珂與一位青年記者間的愛的糾紛上，拖着有情人終成眷屬的尾巴，俗化了極戲劇性的題材。</p>
<p>不錯，其中也有着暴露生前是聲名狼藉的浪蕩者，死後却以隆重的喪儀，與邀請名人來掩羞的事實，以及用諷刺的手法來説出父子，夫婦間的關係的。可是作者並不曾用暴露或諷刺的態度來處理，僅是爲了劇的發展，或增加笑料，輕微地接觸到而已</p>
<p>演出方面看來，導演Marion　Gering的手法尙輕快，如以牛奶車的輕聲來寫出這穆靜的學校宿舍，關不住這位好動的女性。寫曼麗珂的小狗的幾次出塲，成問題地加重後來劇情的開展，可是並不覺得煩冗。從曼麗珂母親的吩咐上寫到她在火車上，從「籃會」中曼麗珂的嬌嫣可人的態度，寫到被縛與受辱時的羞愧憤怨，顯示她的天眞無辜。塲面與調子的變換頗活潑清麗。寫少年記者的規勸曼麗珂去當舞女，與和她母及經理們的爭吵而去這一段也極潑刺生動，與沉着有力。只是在曼麗珂失去記者裘林後感到空虚而忽然覺悟這一過程，轉變得太快。我想讓她在舞台上作過成名的演出，或由另一青年對她有什麽愛的糾紛後再找裘林時，這對於前述的裘林憤走一塲更爲有力些。</p>
<p>伊達露披諾演得較好。李却亞倫那樣的個性與體態演鄉鎭記者幾種角色，似乎不大適合吧。</p>
<h3>好萊塢花絮</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>聽了眞使人不相信，秀蘭鄧波兒竟會在一星期中失去了一萬金元。原來事實是這樣的：綠衫磯的某播音臺曾要求秀蘭以每週三千五百金元的報酬替該臺播音；又紐約的某劇團願以每週六千五百金元聘請她登臺公演。可是秀蘭的雙親因爲恐怕她因此更加聲名洋溢，將來更弄得不可開交，所以就直捷痛快地替她拒絶了。這就是説她在一週間損失了一萬金元呀！</p>
<p>據　　報告，每年到好苛來塢來，願做明星的少女共有五千人之多。而其中眞能達到目的的，不過只有百分之二而已。白倍蘭史丹妮夫婦看了這可憐的事實，非常的對這些少女們表同情，所以爲了救濟她們起見，竟雇用了十三個女傭人！</p>
<p>雷門諾伐羅的兄弟，安東尼奥沙馬聶高斯新近在墨西哥創辦了一間影片公司。據説這位早已退出電影界的諾伐羅將主演一部影片云。這眞是一種兄弟愛的表現。</p>
<p>最近賈里古柏的父親爲汽車所輾傷，而這位孝子賈里，聽説曾擱起了拍戲的工作，接連三天坐在病院看護他的父親。</p>
<p>名導演范達克又和米高梅公司繼續訂了三年新合同。聽了眞要使人「眼睛亮」，他在一年中總要休息八個月啊！所以他每年只不過工作四個月吧了，會賺錢的人誠然不同凡響！</p>
<p>米老鼠的創造主華爾特狄斯耐將向一家餅乾公司起訴。原因是爲了没有得到他的允許，該公司竟擅自製造「米老鼠形」的餅乾！</p>
<p>消息傳來，環球公司民將在德國設立一專製外國語版的製作塲云。</p>
<h3>電影漫話</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>有人以爲中國影片公司宜攝製神怪影片，因爲攝製神怪片可以使中國電影技術進步。</p>
<p>是的，正和一般紳士一樣，他們口口聲聲只要求着「技術」，「天才」，至於中國的民衆怎樣被麻醉，被毒害，他們是不願意，也不高興顧及的。</p>
<p>要是那些紳士們一天不　清出去則中國的電影事業也一天不會得救。</p>

<h3>相逢待嫁（Forsaking　all　Ochers　）（三）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>傑弗雷一到曼麗的家裏，把他嚇了一跳。他站在外面套間裏，背朝署墻，望着裏面大廳上，賓客如雲，男的女的，熙攘往來，説着笑着，有的端着香檳杯子，喝着鷄尾酒，有的趁着無綫電中的爵士音樂，跳着舞，有的閑站着吸烟。伊琳諾爾，跳着舞走近傑弗雷的身旁，　第一個看見了他。一回兒，傑弗雷就成了一大羣的中心點了。大家七嘴八舌的問着他，使他應接不暇起來。他四面張望着，尋找曼麗，迭倫過來了。他看見了多年未見的老友，喜歡得什麽似的。他幾乎不相信那眞是外國回來的傑弗雷了。「這眞好！這眞奇怪！這裏就短少你一個人……你眞的就回來了！他儘着接一連二地説着。</p>
<p>傑弗雷莫名其妙起來道：「這到底是怎麽回事？這許多人，來做什麽的？」迭倫道：「你還不知道嗎？什麽事？哦……我當着你特爲爲了這個來的呢！這是最偉大的一晚了……「迭倫還想再問，可是一個女郎的聲音，將他的問題打斷那聲音就是傑佛雷所要聽的聲音。是曼麗的聲音。曼麗這時連跳帶奔地下了樓，一跑喊着！「他在那裏？他在那裏？」</p>
<p>她站在門口了，美麗得如同一幅美人畫。她已經看見了傑弗雷，傑弗雷亦已經看見了她。他們二人互相端詳了一回，如在夢寐之中，大家脈脈無言。　後來他們二人，在大廳的中心相會了。傑弗雷將她緊緊地摟在懷裏，很熱烈地吻着。一回兒，傑弗雷將曼麗推開了，審視着她，似乎有些害怕似的。曼麗道：傑弗雷，寳貝，你來了，一切都完備了，一點毛病都没有了……」傑弗雷揷嘴道：「什麽一點毛病都没有了？這是捉迷藏嗎，一定要我自已去尋的嗎？」迭倫在旁邊笑道：「曼麗，他還没有知道哩……傑弗雷……曼麗連忙擋住了他道：「讓我來告訴他。傑弗雷，我快要做迭倫杜達夫人了！」</p>
<p>傑弗雷猛然地吸進了一口氣，在那可怖的一霎時間，他四週的世界，好像都銷燬了天上亦没有日月星辰了。他一路從外國外來，本來是爲了曼麗而來的。他説爲了曼麗，就是要他從外國游泳着回來，他亦是情願的。可是現在……」一回兒，他的知覺漸漸恢復過來。他勉强地在臉上裝出了一些笑容，但是要他説話，却説不出來了。曼麗儘着看着他，似乎尋覓什麽東西似的。她説道：「唔，你不高興嗎？你不恭喜我嗎？你不叫迭倫好好的看待我們的耐兒嗎？你不要吻新嫁娘嗎？」</p>
<p>傑弗雷好像無可奈何似的乾笑了一下，輕輕地股了曼麗的香腮，然後掉轉身來，對於迭倫道：「好好的……看待……我們的……耐兒……」大家於是都笑了起來。迭倫大聲道：「我們的耐兒，會當心她自已的！」曼麗再拉住了傑弗雷的手道：「你來將新娘送掉吧」（按，就是做主婚人的意思）。傑弗雷微微點着頭。他自已思量着無論什麽事，决不至於此現再傷心到什麽地步的了。他於是説道：「當然，我要將你送掉的。」他頓了一頓，双説道：「我爲什麽不將你送給人家呢？」傑弗露於是又勉强着，和大家談着話。他亦和曼麗私下談了許多話，可是他一些没有説出。他心裏甜酸苦辣的味兒，不久大家亦就散了，男客們没有成家的，都要去參加童男子的聚餐了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Bao Yueqing Arrives in Beiping to Discuss the Current Situation of the Mongolian Political Council</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yueqing, director of the Finance Department of the Mongolian Political Council, returned to Beiping from Bailing Temple last night. He visited Prince Suo this afternoon and scheduled to meet Huang on the 14th to report on the current situation of the Mongolian Political Council. Bao said, "I have been back to the council for over a month, and the situation in the Fangping area has been reported to the Mongolian Political Council. Bailing Temple is warm this year, and the temperature is similar to that of Beiping. The area is peaceful. The small group of bandits who fled from Wuchuan to Yanghou has also been pursued and suppressed. The funds for the Mongolian Political Council have been issued until December. The Mongolian Political Council will hold a general meeting after the Lunar New Year. Regarding the location of the meeting, a site construction committee has been established, with Prince De as the chairman, to plan everything. The construction cost requires 128,000 yuan. The central government has ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds. 28,000 yuan has already been allocated, and the Ministry of Finance has promised to pay the remaining 100,000 yuan in two installments. The site has been surveyed and is located five miles from Bailing Temple. The houses will be built in the old Chinese style, and timber and glazed tiles are currently being purchased. The Mongolian Political Council's office in Beiping still needs to be delayed due to limited funding. There are currently no Japanese activities in Bailing Temple and other places. The Chahar Provincial Government's office in Pangjiang has not yet been established, but Chief of Staff Huang has been dispatched with more than ten people to reside near Prince De's residence to coordinate everything. There have been proposals to reorganize the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, inviting Prince De to serve as the chairman and work in Beijing. However, Prince De, due to the importance of the border region, is unwilling to leave Mongolia, so it is unlikely to happen. The Mongolian Political Council donated more than 200 Mongolian horses to Chiang Kai-shek and other officials. Deputy Adjutant Liu Jiahua of the Security Department of the Mongolian Political Council escorted them to Sui yesterday, and they can be transported to Beijing immediately. Chiang Kai-shek promised to allocate supplies. Part of the supplies have been transported to Suiyuan and will be transported to Bailing Temple for use. The remaining part will continue to be transported. The Zhang Fenglin case still needs to be investigated. Prince De and others have telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. I am waiting in Beiping to meet He, requesting an impartial investigation to get to the bottom of the matter." (13th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>How Much Longer Can Salt Reform Be Delayed? - Court</h3>
<p>Our country values salt administration. Its origins are ancient. Sadly, good laws have long been neglected, and accumulated problems are deeply rooted. In the late Qing Dynasty, salt affairs were shrouded in darkness, even giving rise to the colloquialism "muddled salt." Since the establishment of the Republic of China, due to loan guarantee relationships, we have had to rely on foreign advisors to carry out reforms. In recent years, salt tax revenue has indeed improved compared to the past. However, salt is a daily necessity for the people. Taxing salt is a type of capitation tax, as it is known in public finance. It is generally acknowledged by those in the field that this is inconsistent with modern principles of taxation. Moreover, the system of designated areas and exclusive merchants is an enormous problem. In May of the 20th year, the National Government's court, in light of this, swiftly passed the new salt law, initiating the modern reform of salt administration. The new law stipulated that after its promulgation, a salt administration reform committee would be established, directly under the Executive Yuan, to be in charge of all reform plans pertaining to this law. Now, more than three years have passed since the promulgation of the new law, and only recently has there been discussion of establishing the reform committee within the next week. It is hoped that the government authorities can learn from past mistakes and overcome difficulties, so that this new salt law, which the entire country anticipates, can complete its mission as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to the first article of the new salt law, reforming salt administration must follow two major paths: one is taxation at the production site, and the other is free trade. This has always been advocated by those in our country who call for reforming salt administration. Taxation at the production site means tax comes before salt, a single tax</p>
<p>is good. The practice of monopolization will have no opportunity to arise. Furthermore, even considering the state's tax revenue, after free trade, the price of salt will definitely fall, sales will definitely be brisk, and the salt tax does not need to be increased, yet tax revenue will naturally flourish. However, since the Song and Yuan dynasties, our country has implemented a system of permits that dictates "fixed sites for salt production, fixed areas for salt sales, and fixed merchants for salt transport." These "fixed merchants" control the salt industry and have long considered themselves a privileged class. As soon as they hear that reform is about to happen, they rise up as a group to lobby, relying on their substantial capital to make a final struggle. Some even spread alarmist rumors, saying that after the new law is implemented, the government will lose 80 to 90 million yuan in fixed old taxes, in order to divide the position of the administrative and legislative branches. What they rely on as a hereditary talisman is the abnormally developed permit. Permits are licenses for transporting salt and have no reason to be hereditary. Moreover, the permits obtained by salt merchants in our Republic of China did not require any payment. Therefore, even if permits are used as collateral for loans in practice, it is merely a form of credit guarantee and absolutely cannot be compared to negotiable securities. Furthermore, the nature of exclusive merchants themselves is merely designated salt transport agents of the state, not private merchants in the sense of private law. Although these people call themselves exclusive merchants, they have no exclusive rights to sell salt at all.</p>
<p>The government need not pay any price to recover the permits. However, according to a petition submitted by the exclusive merchants of the four banks of the Huainan River in April of last year, the government collected 4 million yuan in permit verification fees from Huai merchants in the 18th year of the Republic of China. If the permits are canceled, the merchants should be reimbursed for the permit verification fees to demonstrate great trustworthiness, and so on. The exclusive merchants use this reason to blackmail. In reality, a mere four million yuan is not enough to obstruct the implementation of the new salt law. Legislative Member Ma Yinchu once said, "In recent years, the national salt tax revenue has been no more than 120 million yuan per year. If the new salt law is followed, at least 280 million yuan can be obtained." Which is more important is clearly evident.</p>
<p>As for taxation at the production site, it is necessary to first organize the production sites and improve the anti-smuggling efforts. Organizing the production sites is to ensure the safety of salt storage, and the method is to build warehouses to centrally store the salt. The Salt Affairs Audit Office previously proposed building Changlu salt storage as a national model. Later, it was extended to southern Sichuan, northern Huai, and the four banks of the Yangtze River. Inside and outside each storage facility, transportation equipment was added as much as possible, which was said to facilitate anti-smuggling and bandit suppression. However, anti-smuggling and bandit suppression rely on the dedication and law-abidingness of the anti-smuggling teams and salt police in each province. Otherwise, as in the late Qing Dynasty, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang also had so-called "salt-catching battalions," but the commanders and officers in the battalions were mostly bandits and scoundrels who had been recruited and surrendered, ostensibly engaged in anti-smuggling but actually engaged in smuggling. Even if the production sites can be organized, it is still not enough to prevent smuggling. Taxation at the production site simply allows the salt within the storage facilities to be transported and sold by the people without restriction after being taxed once. If it is possible to smuggle and sell salt before it is taxed, then even if the tax rate is extremely low, it will inevitably not be able to compete with tax-free smuggled salt. The measure of taxation at the production site cannot be fundamentally implemented. How can one hope for the reduction and equalization of tax rates? Therefore, building salt storage facilities and improving anti-smuggling efforts are both urgent tasks and cannot be neglected. At the Fifth Plenary Session last winter, a resolution was made to fully implement the new salt law by the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China. The reform committee, which is in charge of all plans for the new salt law, will also be established soon. The suffering of the people caused by salt administration has been long-standing. Now that there is an opportunity to eliminate the old and establish the new, how can we continue to delay? We dare to loudly call for the realization of the "taxation at the production site" and "free trade" in the new salt law on the eve of the establishment of the reform committee.</p>

<h3>Washington Cables Report on the Silver Issue to Be Released by Our Government</h3>
<p>Joint Research Results with Jinling University</p>
<p>Rising Silver Prices Affect Our Finances</p>
<p>(Washington) Local silver experts, given the rising trend of silver prices, believe that if they rise further, the difficulties of tight finances now being experienced by China will become even more difficult to handle. The Chinese government and Nanjing Jinling University will soon jointly publish a report on the silver issue. Local experts intend to predict what the report will contain. They have now studied the materials obtained from Washington by Lewis, an agricultural statistics expert at Jinling University. The materials strongly state that the rise in silver prices over the past three years has gradually made China's economic panic even worse. China's imports have also declined as a result, but exports have not necessarily been affected in any way. For the sake of self-defense, China can adopt various methods, such as flexible exchange standards, etc. Lewis also believes that if silver prices rise further, major difficulties will also occur in China's monetary system.

<p>(Washington) The Ministry of Commerce announced today that the total amount of silver imported in the week ending January 4 was US$2,640,585, while last week it was US$889,222. According to reliable sources, the increase in imports was due to congressional silver faction members criticizing the Ministry of Finance for its weak silver purchases. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, $429,907 came from the United Kingdom, $1,108,417 from Mexico, and $610,000 from China. (12th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Economic Panic Reduced</h3>
<p>The Hague According to recent statistics released by the International Labor Office, the economic panic in most countries has been reduced. However, within the Netherlands, the panic has increased unabated, which is worrying. As of the end of 1934, out of the 8 million people in the Netherlands, 350,000 were unemployed. Among them, the Port of Rotterdam was most affected by the decline in foreign trade, with as many as 49,275 unemployed. Among Dutch industries, the textile industry has been most affected by the economic panic. In 1929, the export value of textiles was 150,000,000 guilders, which decreased to 112,000,000 guilders in 1930, and to 79,000,000 guilders in 1931. After that, it decreased even more, to 33,000,000 guilders in 1932, to 21,600,000 guilders in the following year, and to 19,800,000 guilders last year. In addition, the tonnage of Dutch exports last year also decreased by 75% compared to 1929. (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Tottori Prefecture, Japan</h3>
<p>1,600 Houses Destroyed, More Than 2,000 Victims</p>
<p>Tottori At 7:45 p.m. yesterday, the 12th, a fire broke out in Sakaimachi, Tottori Prefecture. Because it was fanned by strong winds at the time, the fire spread very rapidly. The nearby corridors and verandas caught fire, extending to the main streets of Kyomachi, Matsueda-cho, Suehiro-cho, and Hidemachi, burning about one-third of the area and destroying up to 200 houses. It was not extinguished until around 1:00 a.m. on the 13th. Because it was Saturday that day, there were many people coming and going, so there were probably many injured. In Sakaimachi, the number of houses destroyed reached 1,600, with more than 2,000 victims, which was a very tragic situation. (13th Rengo Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Snow Clears, Drizzle Falls, Saar Vote Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Torches on the German Border Burned All Night</p>
<p>All Churches Rang Their Bells in Prayer</p>
<p>Victory Belongs to Germany</p>
<p>Saarbrücken After two days of heavy snow, a drizzle began this morning around 9:00 a.m. The roads were muddy, but voters were still enthusiastic, to the point that ballots were scarce. Villagers scrambled to take public buses and trains. In places without public transportation, voters did not hesitate to trudge through the mud on foot. Judging from the initial situation, the number of voters must be very large. In the past few days, the mutual struggles and public propaganda of the various factions have made the residents' excitement unable to be restrained. Those who are able to do so must go to vote. As of the time of dispatch, there have been no riots or irregular demonstrations. The international police force is stationed in the barracks, ready to be dispatched, but they will not be easily dispatched unless there is an emergency. Voting will end at 8:00 p.m. tonight, at which time the police force will be dispatched to escort the ballot boxes to Saarbrücken for counting. According to the observations of those familiar with the actual situation, the results of the vote will undoubtedly be that the Saar will return to Germany. However, there will also be many who want to maintain the status quo, and those who support returning to France can be said to be extremely rare. It is reported that many people have filed protests, saying that National Socialist Party members have used printed materials to distribute them to households throughout the territory to carry out intimidation. (13th Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken The weather is very cold, but the people of the Saar came out in droves this morning, braving the cold and gathering at the polling places in order to decide the future of their motherland. The snow on the road is quite deep. Many people walked, but even more came to the town by car. Members of the National Socialist Party shoveled snow to clear the streets, and pulled out cars that were stuck in the snow, which was convenient for pedestrians. Each polling place was extremely active, with hundreds of people waiting in line, as only four people were allowed to enter to vote each time. A sign saying "Please do not speak" was posted outside the door, and everyone obeyed, so the order was quite good. There were very few soldiers and police on the scene. Former German Prime Minister Papen arrived here this morning with his wife and two daughters to vote, waiting in the crowd for ten minutes. The most dedicated person to arrive today was a woman. She departed from Shanghai, passed through Siberia, spent sixteen days on the train, and arrived in Berlin this morning. She hired a plane to rush here to vote. Snowflakes were flying all over the city, and rumors of unrest were also spreading in the sky. However, several Reuters reporters took cars this afternoon and went to various places to inspect. Except for children picking up snow and throwing it, they did not see any disturbances. Listening to the language of the people on the road and in the taverns, I felt that the National Socialist Party was confident of winning, so even if there were disturbances, it would not damage their chances of victory. However, some people also fear that extreme opponents of the National Socialist Party will cause trouble after the vote in order to influence the League of Nations Executive Council and pass a resolution to divide the Saar's land. However, at present, there are no signs of trouble from any side. The only sound outside the polling place this morning was silence, as those waiting in line to vote stepped on each other's feet to keep warm. A Reuters reporter asked a clerk, "You don't seem to have police protection." He replied, "I don't think I need it, but if something happens, I only need to stop the voting, and the whole area will feel the trouble of having to vote again." In the afternoon, the reporter saw British soldiers reading books, writing, or playing various games to the sound of harmonicas. A soldier answered the reporter's question, saying that only one person in the team can speak German and does not understand the local dialect, but we get along very well with the residents.

<h3>Voting Lines Calm</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken The progress of the Saar plebiscite is very quiet, which is in contrast to the excitement of the people in recent days. From the impression of the onlookers, the voting situation can be summed up in one sentence, that is, "silence on the front lines during the plebiscite." Since this morning, voters have been pouring into polling stations everywhere like a tide, and it is likely that all procedures can be completed within one day. Everything in the polling station has been determined in advance, so it is as accurate as a mathematical formula. In front of each polling station, there is a team of National Socialist Party German Front members, wearing white armbands, and a team of Socialist and Communist Party United Front members, wearing red armbands, standing opposite each other, quiet and silent. Voters pass in front of the two teams of members, enter, and go to the voting table. Under the supervision of a neutral country official, they hand over their passport and voter registration certificate to a city council member for review. The council member gives them an envelope and a ballot, which lists three options: (1) Return to Germany, (2) Merge with France, (3) Maintain the status quo. Voters must mark a cross next to the option they choose. Any action or speech that is sufficient to indicate the voter's opinion is prohibited. After the voter makes a cross in the isolation room, they vote in the box under the supervision of the neutral country director, and then exit. Voters only need to show their voter registration certificate to ride the tram for free, so the crowding on the Saar tram is unprecedented. Since this morning, it has been snowing, and everything is white. There are no traces of police or troops on the street. All that can be seen are wooden signs placed by the German Front, covered with advertisements, stating the importance of today. In addition, the Administrative Committee decided that various publications are prohibited from being sold today. German newspapers were rushed to be sold last night. For the enemy party, spreading absurd and unfounded news, such as saying that the Vatican's official newspaper, the Roman Observer, criticized the New Saar Post, an anti-National Socialist Catholic newspaper, is completely untrue. (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>All Factions in High Spirits</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken According to responsible sources, the rumors that the plebiscite will be postponed have no basis. The Socialist and Communist Party United Front have accused the German Front of carrying out serious terrorism and requested a postponement of the vote, which has been rejected by the Administrative Committee. In order to curb the excitement of the people and prevent accidents, the Administrative Committee issued an order today that no leaflets or newspapers may be printed or issued in the Saar tomorrow, and the sale of spirits is prohibited. Tomorrow, the sale of light wine and beer will be limited to 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. It is snowing heavily today, and it is expected that the hundreds of special trains carrying ballot boxes from various places and transporting voters to their places of origin to vote will be slightly delayed. Tonight, all the small mountains and the German border area will burn torches all night, and the churches will ring their bells continuously.</p>
<p>Now, no matter whether the German Front or the United Front gets more votes, the number of votes in favor of merging the Saar with France must be very small. The pro-France faction is scattered in various places, has no organization, and has no newspaper to carry out propaganda. It is questionable whether they can get 5,000 votes. From another point of view, the plebiscite is a very interesting event, because the people of the Saar are originally Germans, but now they can freely vote to express their opinions on Hitlerism without fear of retaliation. The National Socialist Party and the Communist Party are now paying very close attention to the plebiscite, because this move is nothing less than putting the German head of state Hitler and his comrades to the highest test, and it is also nothing less than a free election to see what direction the people's policies towards the National Socialist Party are taking. The Communist Party and the Socialists have been deeply saddened by the recent implementation of dictatorships in various European countries, which has overwhelmed their power. Therefore, in this vote, they are all in high spirits, making a final resistance.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters telegram from Geneva, it is expected that no major disturbances will occur during the Saar plebiscite. If serious warnings from Saarbrücken are received, an emergency meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council will be convened tomorrow night.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Berlin, when the Saar plebiscite is held, all churches in Germany will ring their bells for one hour. It is reported that all churches in Germany will also pray for "justice and victory." In order to prevent messages unfavorable to Germany from spreading to the public, the German authorities have ordered the secret police to confiscate all English and French newspapers published yesterday, except for the British Times and the French Times.</p>
<p>Also according to news from Geneva, as soon as the results of the plebiscite are clear, the United Kingdom intends to make a concrete decision on the future of the Saar as soon as possible. It is hoped that this decision can be made at the end of this session of the League of Nations Executive Council at the end of next week. Geneva people now regard the next few days as one of the most important turning points in European history.</p>
<p>In recent months, the United Kingdom and France have cooperated closely on the Saar issue. Judging from the current situation, the cooperation between the two countries will continue. British Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and French Foreign Minister Laval met in Geneva today for two hours, and the two sides had very harmonious opinions.</p>
<p>Saar Jewish residents declared today that they had received "advice" to go to Germany tonight and return after the plebiscite next week. Upon returning, they must present their passports stamped in Germany to prove that they came to participate in the vote. It is reported that this advice came from the National Socialist Party, saying that if the Saar returns to Germany, Jewish residents can avoid the revenge of punishment. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ballot Boxes Transported by Tanks</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken After the snow cleared in the Saar, it was as white as silver. At dusk, bonfires were lit on the top of Bilus Mountain, the highest point in the area. National Socialist Party members said that these bonfires meant "on the eve of the vote, all Saar people should think of their compatriots in Germany." At the same time, bonfires were also lit on the highlands on the German border, 25 miles away, and the church bells were ringing in unison. There were 25 special trains carrying voters from Germany, all of which were blocked by the snow, and local transportation was also greatly inconvenienced. It is reported that the ballot boxes will be transported by Italian tanks, because this method can not only keep the ballot boxes safe, but also prevent them from being blocked by the snow. (12th Guomin Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Awaits Results</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is now confirmed that the current session of the League of Nations Council will adjourn only after "interpreting" the results of the Saar plebiscite and, if necessary, making a decision on the transfer of Saar sovereignty. Before the plebiscite results are announced, the Council will begin discussing the various issues on the agenda tomorrow. It is expected that matters will be concluded by the end of the week. In the meantime, experts from France and Germany will, under the auspices of the Saar Three-Member Committee, conduct negotiations at a location within Italy to implement the solutions to various economic and financial issues of the Saar as stipulated in the agreement established by the Three-Member Committee in Rome last November. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Significance of the Saar Vote</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken The Saar region will hold a plebiscite tomorrow. At that time, 550,000 male and female citizens of the Saar will have the right to vote. Among them, the Saar people who have joined the German Front believe that Hitler is the embodiment of Germanism, just like the previous rulers before Hitler. However, the Socialists, Communists, and some Catholics believe that the Hitler regime is actually poisoning Germany, and that the Saar region cannot be merged with Germany as long as Hitler is in power. Although the opinions of both sides are diametrically opposed, both sides recognize that the vote on January 13 is the final struggle for Germany to fight Hitler. If the pro-status quo faction wins the vote, the traditional Germanism will undoubtedly open up another path to strive for a "Fourth Germany" against Hitler. From this point of view, this Saar plebiscite has become a struggle of principle, and it should be noted by the whole world. In this plebiscite struggle, the National Socialist Party has various conveniences. The National Socialist Party engaged in large-scale propaganda, believing that those who did not vote in favor of merging with Germany betrayed Germanism and the motherland. This kind of propaganda is very effective. In addition, party members were sent to threaten residents, and those who were unwilling to blindly follow the National Socialist Party's claims would have their names put on a blacklist and punished. However, the pro-status quo faction has also achieved a great deal in recent weeks. They have tried their best to explain to the Saar people that voting in favor of maintaining the status quo at present does not mean complete separation from Germany. In the future, when the political situation in Germany changes, the Saar region can still hold a second plebiscite to merge with Germany. Therefore, there are many people in the Saar who are inclined to maintain the status quo. In addition, the Pope has repeatedly announced that the Catholic Church takes a completely neutral attitude towards the Saar vote. Therefore, Catholics will vote according to their individual will. The final outcome of tomorrow's vote is in the hands of Catholics. In short, it is currently difficult to predict the results of the vote, and it is impossible to speculate on the proportion of votes on all sides. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Declares the Crisis of the Marseille Incident Has Passed</h3>
<p>The Rome Agreement Reveals More Hope for Peace</p>
<p>British and French Foreign Ministers Hold Long Talks in Geneva</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Flandin gave a speech at a Democratic Alliance banquet here tonight, outlining the French government's policy, saying, "The danger of war caused by the Marseille massacre has been avoided, and the Rome Agreement in the New Year reveals more hope for peace. The London talks in the future will further consolidate this agreement." Regarding financial issues, Flandin said that those who hold securities should be able to redeem them at any time, and the government's payment of cash does not require expansion. Most of Flandin's speech was about domestic issues, and he claimed that his assumption of the prime ministership was to save France's declining commerce and crumbling free organizations. Flandin did not discuss the conference to be held in London. (Minguo News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Hungarian government today submitted to the League of Nations a report regarding the South's accusations that Hungarian officials were involved in the assassination of the Southern King and French Foreign Minister Barthou in Marseille. This report acknowledges that some low-level officials were ineffective and should be punished. It is expected that British Lord Privy Seal Eden will, in his capacity as rapporteur, decide that the Hungarian government's report has clarified the entire incident. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and French Foreign Minister Laval held two hours of talks here today, actively discussing Germany's return to the Disarmament Conference and its reconsideration of withdrawing from the League of Nations. The issues they discussed included Germany's demands for equality in principle and in fact regarding its military and political status, the Eastern European Locarno Treaty, and the recent Franco-Italian agreement in Rome. More attention was paid to the agreement to maintain Austria's independence and territorial integrity. Today's talks were probably of a preparatory nature, so that Laval and Flandin could continue when they went to London. (Minguo News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval held long talks with British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden today, and then met with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. In the evening, he will have dinner with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. According to British officials, Laval presented the content and scope of the Rome Agreement to Simon and Eden. Simon warmly congratulated Laval, believing it to be an element of consolidating peace. Regarding the Saar issue, the two British representatives put forward their opinions, advocating that a final solution be reached during the current Council meeting to seek European pacification. Finally, the two foreign ministers discussed Prime Minister Flandin and Laval's trip to London at the end of this month. According to recent rumors, the British government advocates abolishing the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, so as to enable Germany to participate in the Rome Agreement and return to the League of Nations. However, from the impression gained from today's talks between Simon, Eden, and Laval, the British side does not seem to be prepared to seek Germany's rapid return to the League of Nations without careful consideration. As for the consequences of the Rome Agreement in Europe, it will be further studied in detail when Flandin and Laval go to London. The conclusion of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty and Germany's return to the League of Nations are also the same. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister's Speech on Domestic Issues</h3>
<p>Saving the Economic Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Maintaining the Republican System</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Flandin broadcast a speech on domestic issues today, reviewing the achievements the government has made in accordance with the cabinet's policy statement, such as passing the military budget, clarifying the wheat and wine markets, and reducing bread prices. He first said, "I only have one purpose, that is, to save France from two major disasters, namely, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the political system is in turmoil. When I formed the cabinet, it was just after the Marseille massacre. The political situation was precarious and full of dangers. When the New Year began, we saw the blue sky through the clouds and fog. Yesterday's Rome Agreement and tomorrow's London talks all have the sole purpose of consolidating peace." Flandin then described the criticisms from all sides, saying that he has a firm will to reform domestic affairs and will never be shaken. Although the industrial agreement advocated by the government has been opposed by the general public, it is actually less dangerous than the currently secretly signed industrial agreements. "I once advocated organized freedom, and I now advocate freedom of defense, because if some industries form trade associations and raise prices, the national economy will be overwhelmed, and as a result, poverty and unemployment will be created, and industrial organizations will be scattered. Economic freedom should be respected, but it should not be confused with capital's privilege over labor. Public savings should be managed by national economic institutions, but not by capitalists for profit. The government is now trying to increase loans to meet the needs of the budget and the treasury, but it should not allow the market price of issued loans to fall and the interest rate on long-term loans to rise. If not, the national economy will inevitably collapse. The government also supports reducing interest rates, because most enterprises must wait for interest rates to fall before they can resume business. As for those who hold important securities, they can redeem their securities at any time and obtain circulating funds by relying on the sound application of the discount rate and advances. If so, the same results can be achieved without implementing inflation. As for the stability of the franc, it should still be maintained. In short, the government is striving to restore trust, stimulate the people, and develop enterprises." Flandin firmly advocated that political reform should be implemented gradually. The government has submitted a judicial reform bill to Congress, stipulating that judges should be detached from politics and establish a chief inspector of judges, who will be selected from among the senior judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, and will be responsible for managing the appointment and promotion of judges. In recent years, cases of judicial corruption have emerged one after another. Although many are fictional, public sentiment is boiling and the responsibility must be investigated. The reason why the court cannot bring all kinds of corruption cases to light is not in the corruption cases themselves, but in the way the judicial organization is structured. Now we must make judges free from political influence, and then judicial administration will be self-sufficient. The government will soon draft other political reform bills, and the House of Representatives will revise its rules of procedure. Finally, referring to foreign policy, he said that he and Foreign Minister Laval will continue the policy of peace and cooperation with all nations, saying, "I deeply know that we must be rich and strong before we can maintain peace. I will never neglect this, but I also deeply know that in international relations, we must have a spirit of compromise and practicality." Flandin also said, "I will continue to fight for the relief of unemployment and poverty, because I cannot bear to sit idly by when the common people are in deep water. I hope that the French people, regardless of political parties, will support me with good will. Egoism and pessimism are not desirable. I dare to believe that France will soon be victorious. What is the way to victory? That is, we should know to trust and not doubt, to value discipline and not scatter, to value development and not hibernate, to value action and not talk empty words." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Germany Develops Highways</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Thousands of People Will Participate in Road Construction</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Berlin) The German government recently designated 1,000 kilometers for the construction of national automobile highways. Its main purpose is to connect traffic throughout the country, making it an automobile highway network and increasing the speed of automobile travel. The groundbreaking ceremony has already been held. The German government's plan is based on the fact that automobile traffic has always been far less rapid than trains with tracks, especially automobiles traveling in the countryside. When there are vehicles carrying agricultural products, they are blocked and must travel slowly. In residential areas, we must pay attention to the safety of children and livestock on the roadside, and we cannot drive fast. Moreover, there are many curved roads, which reduces the speed of automobiles. In order to allow automobiles to travel as unimpeded as possible and to achieve a speed of 180 kilometers per hour, it is stipulated to avoid curved routes and take a straight line. At the same time, it is also required that there are no intersections with the same height on this automobile road. Where it crosses the automobile road or the railway track, tunnels or bridges are built so that the automobile can continue to move forward at its driving speed without having to wait for the wrong car. Therefore, the construction of automobiles will be similar to that of railways, with a dedicated line, with a width of seven to eight meters. In order to avoid obstructing visibility under the lights of vehicles and spotlights coming from the opposite side when driving at night, lush trees will be planted at a certain distance to absorb the reflected light. All pedestrians and any vehicles other than automobile stations are strictly prohibited from driving on automobile roads. The setting of the automobile road route should be 30 kilometers away from the busy city, and great attention is also paid to the scenery along the road. According to the Germans, hundreds of thousands of people will participate in road construction. Generally, this automobile highway is regarded as a very large artery in transportation, which will infuse new blood into the national economy. The fundamental difference between this automobile road and the railway in transportation is that travelers are not restricted by the opening hours.</p>

<h3>American Female Aviator's Feat Flies from Honolulu to California</h3>
<p>Eighteen Hours Across 24,000 Miles</p>
<p>The First Woman to Fly Across the Pacific</p>
<p>Oakland, California After flying from Honolulu, the famous American aviator Amelia Earhart arrived here safely in 18 hours and 16 minutes, becoming the first person to fly from Honolulu across 24,000 miles of ocean to California. Heavy fog in the Pacific slowed the flight speed slightly. Everyone was quite anxious because the scheduled time had arrived, but the woman had not yet arrived. When the woman arrived at the airfield, 5,000 people welcomed her. It is said that she felt very tired. There was still enough gasoline in the plane for several hours of flight, so there was really no need to worry about her safety. According to reports, this flight of Ms. Earhart was strongly opposed by the US Navy authorities, who were concerned about the tragedy that befell Australian aviator Ulm's recent attempt to fly between California and Honolulu. To date, ten people have lost their lives trying to navigate this route. It is also reported that Ms. Earhart is the wife of publisher Putnam. Putnam was extremely anxious after Ms. Earhart flew to Honolulu. According to William, a retired naval aviation officer who has cooperated with Ms. Earhart on several flights, Ms. Earhart did not decide on her destination before departing. Later, she decided to determine whether to go directly to Oakland or continue to Los Angeles when flying 60 miles from Oakland, depending on the motor and weather conditions of the plane. During the flight, Ms. Earhart often talked to radio stations on the West Coast via radio. Radio operators from time to time heard Ms. Earhart's "All is well" reports, her voice gentle and clear. When the plane reached the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the radio station received Ms. Earhart's report, saying that she was currently fighting against dense fog and storms. There was no news for several hours afterwards, so people here were extremely worried. But when flying 350 miles from Oakland, Ms. Earhart's "All is well" report arrived again, and then everyone felt relieved. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Oakland Ms. Earhart flew from Honolulu to here at 1:31 pm today, taking 19 hours and 48 minutes en route. This is the first woman to fly from Honolulu to the mainland. More than 5,000 people welcomed her. When she left the plane, the woman was in excellent spirits, wearing a flight suit, quite like Colonel Lindbergh's sister. The woman said that the weather was very good along the way, although it rained from time to time, there was no difficulty. The gasoline she carried was enough for two hours. During the flight, the woman contacted the mainland by radio from time to time. Someone asked how she felt about this trip. The woman said that although the weather was good, it was more difficult than flying across the Atlantic. According to reports, Ms. Earhart flew from Newfoundland to the United Kingdom by plane in 1923, becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic. Since then, she has learned to fly and has achieved great feats. The woman is Mrs. Putnam, but in public, she has called herself Ms. Earhart. (Minguo News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Government Denies Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Brussels The Belgian government today tried its best to deny the rumors of a financial crisis, saying that this is completely unfounded and that the treasury's cash reserves are quite sufficient, as high as 65.98%. However, according to the financial, economic and political circles, the government, because it cannot reduce the standard of living, is afraid that it will reduce the price of currency in order to increase exports.

<h3>America's Great Utopia Movement (New York Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Overcoming Economic Panic Through This</p>
<p>Solving the Unemployment Problem at the Same Time</p>
<p>After the failure of the National Industrial Recovery Act, it was followed by the "New Deal". In fact, whether this policy is effective and can save the United States from the hell of panic is still a question. Therefore, the general intellectual circles are trying to come up with ideas and methods under the current system to overcome the current economic panic. As for whether it is effective, it will be another question. Among these methods, the most eye-catching is the "American Utopian Association", originally named American Utopian Association, abbreviated as U.S.A., which is exactly the same as the abbreviation of the United States of America. Its believers believe that this is not accidental and is very helpful to the future of their movement.</p>
<p>The founder of the Association is "Upton L. Reed", born in Greenwich Village, Latin Quarter, New York State. This movement has now expanded considerably. Since the autumn of 1933, it has published its doctrines and held an inauguration ceremony. However, the internal organization still has some special characteristics, so it has not been fully understood, but the general outline is known to the general public. The membership fee is three US dollars and the monthly membership fee is ten cents. The membership ceremony is often held with a gathering of one or two hundred people. The participants raise their right hands and swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to abide by all laws of the state, city and country. After swearing allegiance, they strive for propaganda work. The propaganda tool is a five-act play that has been compiled. The content of the Association can be seen from the plot of the play. A brief description of the plot is as follows:</p>
<p>The first act is set on a deep blue stage, symbolizing the social conditions of hunger and cold, and the suffering of having no money and no home. After the opening, there is a group of poorly dressed poor people. Their position in the course of life is only to beg. First, they go to a clothing store and beg the clothing store merchant to give them a few pieces of clothing to wear, but the merchant asks them for cash in exchange. They don't have a penny, so they have to endure the cold. They go to the bakery again to tell of their hunger and ask for a little bread to fill their stomachs. The shopkeeper still wants money. If they don't have money, they won't even give them bread crumbs. This group of people is wandering in hunger, and at the same time, it shows the evils of the middleman.</p>
<p>The second act is the high-interest lender's stage. This group of people goes to the high-interest lender to complain. The high-interest lender agrees to lend them money, but asks them for collateral. Those homeless people, what do they have to guarantee? As a result, they are at the end of their rope and have no other choice but to willingly become slaves. The stage is also hidden in semi-darkness.</p>
<p>In the third act, this group of vagrants is wandering aimlessly. They encounter the police, who want to accuse them as "carnivorous citizens" in accordance with the Vagrancy Law. After repeated explanations, the police seem to understand, but ask for some bribes before letting them go. Of course, they don't have money to bribe, so the police accuse them of not paying taxes. Fortunately, the judge sympathizes with the hungry workers and declares that punishing the unemployed is an unreasonable social system. Just as he is about to order their release, the high-interest lender comes out to protest and stops temporarily. This group of poor people retreats, and another rational actor comes out and says to the high-interest lender and other people, "You know that to eliminate poverty, you must replace individual selfishness with the common efforts of everyone. If so, I can lead you to a new world of common happiness."</p>
<p>The fourth act is set up in an ideal area. This group of poor people unknowingly arrives at this place, which is a kind of forgotten men. This is the slogan used by Roosevelt during his campaign. The rational actor explains to them the utopian polity and organization here.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry opposes the current various policies and adopts the principle of uninterrupted surplus. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is solely responsible for the supply and distribution of needs. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for production and focuses on the development of machinery. The Ministry of Education is responsible for educating people under the age of 25 and providing appropriate education according to their talents. The Ministry of National Defense advocates pan-nationalism. It only disposes of surplus items, abolishes the traditional currency system for overseas trade, and the whole United States applies a harmonious commodity exchange system for foreign trade. All nationals under the age of 25 are infants and toddlers and are in the education period. People aged 25 to 45 are productive people. People over the age of 45 have completed their production obligations and retreat from the production process. Those who do not work during the working period are treated as patients and sent to the hospital for treatment. They have no debts or credits, and there are no police agencies, but the government issues production certificates and national certificates. After the rational actor finishes speaking, the stage is hidden in darkness and the utopian song is played, urging people to become their comrades.</p>
<p>The fifth act is first to join the association and pay a three-dollar membership fee, and then to form a society and pass on the secret words and signals within the society.</p>
<p>It is said that the association already has hundreds of thousands of members, and the spread is quite fast. Can this really solve America's economic difficulties? However, it proves their ideals in difficulty. (December 15)</p>
<h3>Deng Mingjie Discusses the Sichuan Situation and Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>New Provincial Government to be Established Within the Month</p>
<p>Bandits Have Three Major Weaknesses</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence, the Sichuan North Front, has seen no recent abnormalities. However, in the vicinity of Suiding City, Red bandits frequently harass the Sichuan army at night with guerrilla tactics. The Sichuan army is well aware of their intention to create chaos and only responds with a small number of troops. The Sichuan army was originally at Shilongxi but has now advanced to Kuzhuxi, a dozen or so miles ahead, where they are building fortifications and maintaining strict vigilance. As for the Liao and Mu troops entering Guizhou, they are currently advancing towards Meitan. Chen Mingqian's division has already departed from Fuling to the front lines. Guo Xunqi's brigade has also moved to Qinan to guard the area. The Guizhou bandits' attempt to enter Sichuan will be difficult to realize. The establishment date of the new provincial government is reportedly set for mid-month. To understand the suppression of the Red bandits and the Central Government's reforms in Sichuan, the reporter paid a special visit to Deng Mingjie, the Secretary-General of the new provincial government, yesterday, who graciously granted an interview.</p>
<h3>Annihilation of the Remaining Bandits is Part of an Overall Plan</h3>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the current situation of bandit suppression. According to him, the Central Government has already established an overall plan for the annihilation of the remaining bandits. All orders executed by Commander-in-Chief Liu are carried out in accordance with the Central Government's intentions. The Central Government is determined to provide the greatest support to Sichuan Province in suppressing the bandits. This sudden breakout of the remaining bandits in Jiangxi may seem rampant on the surface, but in reality, the bandits have many weaknesses and are already at the end of their rope. Their repeated attempts to avoid battle are clear evidence of this.</p>
<h3>Bandits Have Many Weaknesses, the Three Greatest Being</h3>
<p>Their greatest weaknesses are: (1) Most of the bandit soldiers are from Jiangxi Province. This time, their flight from Jiangxi to Guizhou was largely forced. If engaged in battle, they will inevitably collapse without being attacked. (2) Since breaking out of the encirclement last October, the bandit troops have been running through several provinces and are extremely exhausted. Moreover, the bandit masses are unable to endure the hardships of Sichuan and Guizhou, and many have expressed negativity after entering Guizhou, only unable to escape due to the strict surveillance of the bandit leaders. (3) The bandit troops lack machine guns and cannons. In normal combat, they rely solely on rifles. After suffering repeated heavy blows in Jiangxi, their ammunition is almost exhausted. This time, fleeing to Guizhou, they were pursued by eighteen divisions of the Central Army and repeatedly blocked and attacked by the armies of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, suffering heavy losses. According to current estimates, the bandit troops have no more than 20,000 guns at most. In the future, the Sichuan and Guizhou armies will join forces to suppress them, and it is certain that they can be annihilated in the short term.</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression and Political Reform are Equally Important</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the issue of reforming Sichuan's politics. Deng replied that the Central Government has decided to carry out the reform of Sichuan's political affairs at the same time as the military suppression of the bandits. The intention is to promote military success through political power. The precedent of Jiangxi is available for reference. Deng also said that the establishment date of the new provincial government will be after the arrival of the advisory group in Sichuan. His own departure date to the province will also be around this time.</p>
<h3>Nanchuan Builds a Chain of Pillboxes to Defend Against Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the joint defense offices of Jiangjin, Qijiang, Nanchuan, Tongzi, Suiyang, and Hejiang counties have been established, with the promotion of Instructor Ye Peilin as the director. They have also telegraphed the leaders of Sichuan and Guizhou to mobilize the joint defense forces of each county to increase defenses on the Wujiang River, in order to solidify northern Guizhou and protect southern Sichuan. In addition, the Nanchuan County government decided yesterday on three anti-communist measures: (1) Build more chain pillboxes along the border and send militiamen to patrol day and night. If an incident occurs, sound the alarm. The local military will be informed and intensify their vigilance, working together to protect the area. (2) Adopt the organizational regulations of the Anti-Communist Association, establish an office in Shuijiang Town, divide it into food and training groups, and hire military specialists to take charge, in order to strengthen border affairs. (3) Since the westward flight of the Red bandits, the number of refugees from Guizhou has been increasing daily. Special commissioners should be sent to investigate, so as to prevent wandering bandits from taking advantage of the situation and causing trouble.</p>
<h3>Confession of Wang Guangze, Commander of the Pseudo-Independent Division</h3>
<p>A General Overview of Xiao’s Bandit Strength</p>
<p>The Passage from Jiangxi to Sichuan</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence, the Longtan garrison, Tian Guanwu Brigade, recently captured Wang Guangze, commander of the Red bandit pseudo-Sixth Army Corps Independent Division, along with his chief of staff Wu Jinshan, political commissar Cong Chuantong, political director Wei Xiaofen, security bureau chief Liu Daidan, and other leaders, as well as more than 300 bandit officers and soldiers. They have repeatedly presented them to Commander-in-Chief Liu and forwarded them to Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission for instructions on how to handle them. It is now learned that Wang's bandit, while detained in Tian Brigade headquarters, recounted his entry into the bandit ranks and the real situation of the bandit troops. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>"I (Wang Guangze referred to himself below) am from Hengshan County, Hunan Province, and I am 32 years old. I have four brothers, and my family is doing well. I do business selling wood, hides, cattle and sheep, and also cultivate my own fields. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, I joined the army under Peng, the brigade commander of the First Brigade of Zhang Jingyao's army. After a year, I was promoted to sergeant. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, I became a platoon leader. Three months later, because the troops returned to Shanxi, I asked for leave to go home and do business. In the eighteenth year, I joined the army under Wang Pi, the First Division of Wu Shang's Eighth Army. Soon after, I became a private, then a platoon leader. In May of the nineteenth year, I opened up Jiangxi from Hunan to fight Zhu De. After three pursuits and suppressions, I fought to Jinggang Mountain in December. Later, Wu's army was transferred back to Hunan and stationed in You County for reorganization. The army was reduced to a division, and the division was reduced to a regiment. At that time, I was a platoon leader in the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion of the First Regiment. The Ninth Company was disbanded, and everyone was unwilling to continue. I went home again to do business, selling wood and hides to Chaling. I met the Red Army and was arrested. All the capital I had with me, more than 1,700 yuan, was robbed. They persuaded me to work for them. At that time, I couldn't distinguish the good from the bad of the Red Army. I thought it was the same as the ordinary government army, and I could hope for some future, so I joined the Red Army. After joining, because I was a soldier and understood some military common sense, they sent me to Yaobi Chang, Chaling, as the captain of the Red Guard Battalion, with a number of more than 120, all with knives and sticks, with no good guns. When I was the captain of the battalion, they asked me to do whatever they wanted, and I worked very hard. Until September 1931 (that is, the twentieth year of the Republic of China), the Chaling County Soviet transferred me to be the company commander of the guard company. Soon after, I was promoted to the captain of the guerrilla battalion, with three companies under my command, each company with about 30 guns. The role of the guerrillas was to specifically disrupt the government army's line of battle and threaten the rear. I put a lot of effort into it. Afterwards, I was transferred to be the battalion commander of the independent battalion of the Xianggan Provincial Military Region in the Red District. Xianggan Province refers to the border area between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, including Chaling, You County, Ling County, Zixing, and other counties in Hunan, and Yongxin, Ninggang, Lianhua, Ji'an, Wan'an, Taihe, Anfu, and other counties in Jiangxi, with Yongxin as the center. The provincial committee organization is located in that area. The military region commander is Cai Huiwen. The independent battalion has three companies, three machine guns, and each company has a machine gun platoon, with one machine gun. I was the independent battalion. Three months later, I fought several battles with Wang Dongyuan, Li Jue, Chen Guangzhong, Peng Weiren, and other divisions. The Hunan army suffered great losses. After these battles, my independent battalion was expanded into an independent regiment. At that time, the organization of the Red Army in Xianggan Province had 24 divisions. The division commander was Long Ling. There was a replenishment division, a first division, the division commander was Tian Haiqing, an eighth division, an independent regiment, a total of more than 20,000 rifles, 140 machine guns, and 36 mortars. Xiao Ke was the 18th division sent by Mao Zedong from the Central Government in 1933 (that is, the 22nd year of the Republic of China) with more than 1,000 people and guns to be compiled into the Sixth Army Corps. Cai Huiwen was dismissed. In January of this year, my independent regiment was changed to the 53rd Regiment. In June, I departed from Yongxin. An independent division, three independent regiments, and five independent battalions were still left in the Xianggan area. The main force all fled westward. At that time, the team was reorganized into the pseudo-Sixth Army Corps Commander Xiao Ke, the pseudo-Seventeenth Division Commander Xiao Ke concurrently, the pseudo-Eighteenth Division Commander Long Ling, the pseudo-Military Camp School, and the pseudo-Army Corps. After departing from Xianggan, passing through the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, arriving at , Xiao Ke announced an order, saying, "In order to disrupt the enemy and contain the people, so that the pseudo-central retreat cancels the government army, the first step of the plan has now been completed, and the second step of the plan must be implemented quickly." At that time, what was the first step of the plan, and what was the second step of the plan, Ding Jin did not announce to us, so we continued to advance from Chengbu, to receive the task of passing through. In the battle of Wencun on the border between Hunan and Guizhou, I lost more than 100 people. When I arrived in Xiajiang, Guizhou, I prepared to rest for a day. I met the joint encirclement of the Hunan and Guangxi armies and pursued them, losing a battalion of the 52nd Regiment and a battalion of the 54th Regiment. I fought with the 53rd Regiment, still covering the passage of the entire army corps. In Chengbu, I fought with Li Jue's troops, and my right leg was injured. When I arrived in Huangping, Guizhou, Xiao Ke and Ren Bishi announced the pseudo-central order, saying, "Our task is to join forces with He Long, and develop a Red District in Xiang, E, Chuan, and Qian. If we are blocked and dispersed by the government army, we will disintegrate and gather in the direction of Yinjiang, and then find He Long." We fought with the Guangxi army in Qingxi. A battalion of the 49th Regiment and two battalions of the 51st Regiment, a total of three battalions, were cut off. The political commissar of the 17th Division, Li Da, led a fierce charge forward. When he arrived at Fengxiangxi, he had lost two-thirds of his men before he could approach He Long. He Long reported to Li, and he knew that Xiao had arrived and sent troops to meet him, and he met with him at a distance of about 40 li between Benhuang and Ganlongkou. The next day, he arrived at Nan Yaojie. Xiao's troops had 12,000 people when they departed, but only 6,000 or 7,000 people gathered at this time, with 3,000 casualties and 2,000 escaped. Xiao had two radio transceivers, one large and one small. The large one had a power-driven motor. The small one used dry batteries. After camping every day, he telegraphed the pseudo-central government. A senior meeting was held in Nan Yaojie. The attendees included Ren Bishi, Chairman of the Red Sixth Army Corps specially sent by the pseudo-central government (a student studying in Russia), Li Bu, Secretary-General of the Political Department of the pseudo-Army Corps (a student studying in Russia), Gan Shiqi, Political Commissar of the pseudo-18th Division (a student studying in Russia), as well as Xiao Ke, He Long, Guan Xiangyin, Wang Zhen, Liu Shiji, Fang Liming, Xia Xi, and other important senior personnel. First, Xia Xi reported on the actions of the Red Second Army Corps (ie, He Long's troops, formerly known as the Red Third Army, now renamed the Second Army Corps) after Honghu. Then, everyone pointed out Xia's mistakes. The public decided to remove Xia from his post and immediately telegraphed the pseudo-central government for approval. Since then, all the power of the Second and Sixth Army Corps has been in the hands of Ren Bishi alone. Xia Xi also reported that there was a Red District organization with a width of more than 100 li in Fengxiangxi, with 800 people in the Qiandong Independent Regiment, more than 500 people in the Deyi Independent Regiment, and the Sixth Army Corps allocated six machine guns, a company of pistols, and two battalions of infantry to my command. There were also two guerrilla teams and the remaining wounded and sick soldiers. During the meeting, I was appointed as the commander of the Qiandong Soviet Area Combat District Command, and it was agreed to send transportation twice a month to find the team in the direction of Youyang Xiushan to make contact. The next day, they went to Youyang, and I went to Fengxiangxi, and planned to reorganize the team into three regiments. The first regiment was led by Regiment Commander Qin, the second regiment was led by Regiment Commander Tang, and the third regiment was led by Regiment Commander Wu. Xiao Ke sent an order on the way, calling me to be compiled into an independent division. In Fengxiangxi, I was greatly oppressed by the Guizhou army, and after several fierce battles, I suffered great losses and could not gain a foothold. I planned to flee to Fanjingshan to defend it, but the work in the mountains had not yet been completed, and the Guizhou army attacked and occupied it again. So I fled from Zhaiying to Yimei, and wanted to flee from Yimei to western Hunan to join Xiao He. However, I was ambushed by the Miao people in front of Yimei, and lost most of them. In Pingma Yongdong Shangchuan, the troops were blocked by the army and the local defense along the way. The troops have been completely disarmed, and the machine guns and pistols have also been disarmed. I was about to escape, but I was surrounded and captured by your army. I only read books for three years before. After joining the Red Army, I had been to the Red Army Training Team and the Red Army School, and I had graduated. Because I was short-sighted, I mistakenly entered the wrong path. This is a period of my experience in the Red Army. I am very grateful to Brigade Commander Tian for his preferential treatment. It allows me to be instructed here, to understand the great righteousness, and deeply regret my past mistakes. I am determined to oppose communism. In the future, I should seek to perform sincerely in my work. The Red Army is cruel and inhuman, and it is difficult to exist for a long time, and it must be eliminated." According to reports, after Wang's bandit was captured, Liu Xiang had approved the military and local affairs bureau to execute Wang's bandit on the spot.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Ship Hits and Sinks a Customs Patrol Boat in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Customs Officers Fall into the Water and are Rescued</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Negotiates Release</p>
<p>Caihu Correspondence, Anhui Province has a very abundant fish production in the upper reaches, with annual sales to Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and Tongzhou worth tens of thousands of yuan. Because there are no customs posts in the interior, most of them are transported to Wuhu from Datong Anqing by civilian ships first, and then declared for export by Wuhu Customs. However, Wuhu Customs has recently found that fish merchants often smuggle and evade taxes, so they are very strict in their inspection of Jianglun boats passing through Wuhu. Yesterday, the Japanese merchant ship Luoyang Maru was launched. Due to heavy fog, it was delayed until 2:00 PM before arriving at the Wuhu Wharf. Wuhu Customs received a report that a lot of private fish was being smuggled, so they sent Customs officers Chen and Qian to board the ship for inspection. Unexpectedly, before the inspection was completed and the two customs officers had not left the ship, the Luoyang Maru suddenly drummed its wheels, left the wharf, and sailed downstream. Seeing this situation, Wuhu Customs immediately sent two more customs officers to track it down on the customs' Anhui Electric, a small gasoline patrol boat. At that time, the Luoyang Maru had already sailed to the middle of the river, and the water was turbulent, and the waves were surging, causing the Anhui Electric patrol boat to be hit and sunk by the Luoyang Maru. Fortunately, the two customs officers had already climbed onto the Luoyang Maru, and the two people who fell into the water, Lao Da Huang Xueqing and Lao Gui Lei Youbao, were also rescued by boatmen, avoiding a tragedy. Seeing that an accident had occurred, Wuhu Customs used flag signals to stop the Luoyang Maru from sailing. Later, the Japanese Consul in Wuhu, Takeyoshi Sadaharu, rushed to Wuhu Customs and contacted the tax department. The Luoyang Maru did not start sailing downstream until 4:30. Wuhu Customs has decided to investigate the matter strictly in accordance with the law. (11th)</p>
<h3>Banditry in Anhui is Almost Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Establishes a Reception Center in Yanghu Town</p>
<p>Anhui Provincial Government Distributes 3,500 Stones of Relief Rice</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence, Luo Binghui's bandit troops, the pseudo-Nineteenth Division Commander Xun Weizhou (formerly the pseudo-Seventh Army Corps Commander), under the command of the bandit leader Zhu De, used the false name of the Northern Anti-Japanese Advance Team to sneak into southern Anhui, intending to occupy the deep mountains of Huizhou as a nest, create a Red District, and join forces with Fang Zhimin in Tangkou, reorganized into the pseudo-Tenth Army Corps, with a temporary total of more than 6,000 people. However, they did not know that today's southern Anhui is not comparable to the Jiangxi of the past. The self-defense force is relatively sufficient, and the residents have not been seduced by the bandits, and the national army has always followed up and suppressed them, and the bandits have lost the opportunity to establish a nest. They fled east and west, and their strength has gradually disappeared. In addition, after each battle, there are many who suddenly woke up and surrendered. The Anhui Provincial Government Chairman's Office in Tunxi recently learned from the surrendered pseudo-Minister of Health Hu Yungeng, platoon leader Chen Daonan, and bandit soldiers that the number of bandits is now less than 3,000, and the number of guns is only one-third. Many senior bandit officers were also injured or killed. For example, a certain Zhou, the director of the pseudo-Security Bureau, Xi Miyu, the chief of staff, Yue Shaohua, the political commissar, and Liu Ying, the political director, were all seriously injured in Fenshui, Zhangjiajing, and Tanjiaqiao. It is reported that the Xun bandit Weizhou died in Maolin Village, Jing County, after being wounded in Tanjiaqiao. Now, the bandit cadres and soldiers below the regimental commander are very shaken. During each mobile operation, 30 to 40 people flee every day. Liu Zhenhua believes that many of the fleeing responsible members of the pseudo-agency are willing to surrender and reform and participate in anti-communism, and they can also fully describe the pseudo-organization, which shows that they are mostly due to economic oppression, ignorance, blind obedience, or being coerced, so he followed the Nanchang Camp's promulgated method of recruiting and pacifying surrenders and dealing with prisoners, and established a reception center in Yanghu Town on the opposite bank of Tunxi. There are considerable facilities for clothing, food, and housing, and Chen Xiaobo has been appointed as the director, He Qiming as the administrator, and Liu Yizhi as the trainer, to give them training and influence, or send them back to their hometowns separately, in order to open up a new path. In the past, when the counties of Huizhou and Shexian were raided by bandits, many people fled one after another, displaced, fathers and sons were not protected, and husbands and wives did not care for each other, which was extremely miserable. Now the bandits have been almost completely eliminated, and the military strength of each county is strong and the defense is solid, which can ensure that there will be no future troubles. They have all issued notices to gather people back to their hometowns to seek proper resettlement, and the provincial government has decided to distribute 3,500 stones of relief rice to Huizhou for relief. However, because the transportation costs require nearly 10,000 yuan, Liu Jianzhong, the commissioner of the area, has sent separate letters to wealthy fellow villagers from Huizhou living abroad to persuade them to donate money to raise funds for transportation. In addition, after the Huizhou bandits were surrounded and chased, a small number of remnants fled to Shidai Taiping Qidu and other places. The majority of the □□□ division has taken the road to Qidu, stationed in Jiaocun, Taiping, and dispatched teams to build pillboxes in the key points of Shidai Taiping Qingyang and other counties. There are also many pillboxes built from Nanyangwan north through Jiuhua Mountain to Miaoqian, which are very dense and tight. The remaining bandits will soon be caught. (11th)</p>
<h3>Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Rural Cooperation Conference</h3>
<p>The Conference is Expected to Last Three or Four Days</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, bandit disasters have spread in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces for seven or eight years, and bankrupt rural areas have been destroyed without any remainder. In addition to carrying out agricultural relief and immigration and reclamation, the Nanchang Camp and the general headquarters of the three provinces for bandit suppression believe that the only way to restore the rural economy is to promote cooperation. When Chairman Jiang supervised and suppressed the Red bandits in the three provinces, he promulgated the articles of association of the rural cooperative preparatory society, and tried them out in the recovered areas of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Since the various places in this province have been recovered successively, the camp also instructed the Jiangxi Rural Cooperation Committee to act as a rural relief area in each newly recovered area and semi-bandit area, to handle credit, utilization, and sales cooperation of various kinds, and to purchase plowing cattle, seeds, and agricultural implements for the victims of the disaster. Now, the cooperation associations of the four provinces believe that the remaining bandits will soon be eliminated and rural construction will begin. In order to intensify their work to seek universality, they are holding a discussion meeting on rural cooperation work in the four provinces in Nanchang. The meeting place is located in the conference hall of the Jiangxi Rural Cooperation Association on the shore of Donghu Lake in this city. It opened at 9:00 AM on the 7th. Those who attended were Wu Jing, director of the Henan Cooperation Association, Xu Qinglan, chief inspector, Liu Renqiu, chief inspector of Hubei, Yang Xingcun, director of the Anhui, Zheng Dasheng, chief inspector, Xiong Zaiwei, director of the Jiangxi, Yang Yunfu, chief inspector, Li Anlu, design specialist, Zou Huagai, relief director, Li Yuji, Hu Jian, Zhou Guocai, and Wei Jingchu and Du Keming, directors of the Jiangxi office of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association, and more than ten others. Wen Qun, director of the camp's cooperation team and chairman of the Jiangxi Cooperation Committee, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, saying, "Rural cooperation is the main task for the recovery of rural areas and the development of production. All four provinces have started to implement it. Regarding the various laws, regulations, plans, and work implementation, the colleagues of the four provinces should explore and correct each other based on practical experience." Then, the representatives of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi reported on the work of their respective provinces in turn, and nominated members of each group's review committee to submit proposals for review. The meeting is expected to last for three or four days. (9th)</p>
<h3>Military Police in Shantou Strictly Suppress the People's Postal Service</h3>
<p>Search Pedestrians in Streets and Alleys</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, the Ministry of Transportation has ordered the military and political authorities of various provinces to cooperate with the post office to suppress the people's postal service and to limit the people's postal service in all places to end uniformly at the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. This order is being carried out vigorously. There were originally 18 people's postal service offices in Shantou, specializing in collecting and sending letters to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hankou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and the inland areas of Chao and Jie. Delivery has always been known for its speed and reliability. Since the ministry's order was announced to cancel it, the Guangdong Provincial Government also issued orders to the public security bureaus of each county and city government, ordering the stationed troops and police to cooperate with the postal bureau to execute it. December 31 was the last day for the people's postal service to end. Ordinary letters can still be sent by parcel, but the post office has resolutely revoked the business licenses of the people's postal service. At that time, the Shantou People's Postal Service Association issued a declaration requesting assistance from all walks of life. The Shantou Silver Industry Association believed that obstacles would occur in the remittance and delivery of drafts in the future, so it held a meeting on New Year's Day to discuss the matter and discuss reliable and fast methods of delivery in the future. The Shantou Chamber of Commerce also wrote to the Municipal Government Public Security Bureau regarding this matter, requesting a postponement of the execution of the ban, because there were millions of yuan of drafts every day at the end of the lunar year. After this presentation, there was no reply. The most relevant thing is the letters from overseas Chinese in Singapore, Siam, Hong Kong, and other places. Because overseas Chinese remit silver back to their hometowns, the letter must accompany the silver, and then it can be delivered to poor and remote villages in each county. Now that the people's postal service has been banned, it cannot be sent in bulk packages. Batch letters must be affixed with stamps and sent separately. Problems will arise in the future delivery of silver, return of batch letters, etc. It is heard that the post office still allows the batch postal service to be packaged, and the letters must be affixed with sufficient stamps. The amount of silver must be written on the letter. If the letter only says that a certain treasure number is received, it will be considered a normal letter mixed in and will inevitably be opened and read. In addition, the Shantou military police party and government agencies originally sent several members of the mail inspection committee. The situation is serious, so more people have been added. Now, batch letters are also subject to strict inspection. The delivery of batch letters will inevitably be delayed. It is impossible to destroy it even if people do not want to destroy it. Starting from New Year's Day, the military police in Shantou suppressed private letters with very strict arrangements. The customs fronts of each embankment wharf, Chenghai bus station, and Qiluwei are lined with military police. Reconnaissance teams, inspectors, special service teams, and patrol police can search the bodies of pedestrians everywhere to see if there are any private letters. The post office also notified various merchants, stating that the people's postal service has been cancelled. If anyone is found to have given the letter to someone for private delivery, they will be severely fined. There is also an official document to the Hong Kong post office. If a person carrying private letters is captured in Hong Kong, they should be sent back to Shantou for serious punishment. Under this situation, it is credible that no private letter can fly out in the Chaoshan area. From now on, the work of mail inspectors will inevitably become busier. (5th)</p>
<h3>The Complete Elimination of Remaining Bandits in Northeastern Fujian is Imminent</h3>
<p>Scattered Bandits Along the Min River Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the recapture of the bandit areas in northern Fujian, there remained a remnant of about two thousand bandits, entrenched in the areas of Quanshang, Wucun, Fengxi, Bangang, Junkou, and Tangdi in Ninghua County. They constructed defensive fortifications and established a bogus "Min-Gan Military Region Command" in an attempt to revive their activities. Lu Xingrong, commander of the 52nd Division, led his troops to suppress them, recovering Quanshang, Wucun, and Fengxi one by one. Recently, the 33rd Regiment of the Lu Division advanced from Fengxi to attack Tangdi, encountering over a thousand bandits, including the bogus 118th and 120th Regiments, as well as the Training Corps and Guard Company. After a day-long fierce battle, they killed the bogus Command's Chief of Staff, Jiang Han, the Political Director, Peng Hu, and over two hundred bandit soldiers, seizing over one hundred rifles. The bogus Commander, Song Chengquan, and the Political Commissar, Lai Chang, led their remaining forces to flee towards Bangang and Junkou. The Lu Division is currently in pursuit. Furthermore, four bandit groups, led by Weng Shousong, Chen Jiansheng, Lu Chengguang, and Wei Jiankang, numbering about six hundred in total, have been causing disturbances along the Yanping (present-day Nanping) Xiafuzhou and Shangmin River areas. They specialize in extorting "donations" from upstream boats and downstream timber rafts, often killing raft workers and robbing passengers, causing great distress to travelers. Recently, the Security Team's Special Operations Regiment has been conducting encirclement operations in areas such as Shuikou and Huangyou Bay, scattering the Lu Chengguang and Wei Jiankang groups. The remaining bandits have fled to the borders of Yanping and Jian'ou counties. The Weng Shousong and Chen Jiansheng groups, totaling three hundred men, along with their weapons, were all captured and transported to the provincial capital for detention in the Security Office a few days ago. The Min River shipping route should now be safe and stable. As for the remaining Red bandits in eastern Fujian, they have been driven to exhaustion after being rigorously suppressed by the National Army. However, sporadic bandit groups still appear near Shekou in Fu'an County. Chen Zheng, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the New 10th Division stationed in the county, recently led two battalions of his troops on patrols in various areas. The bandit activity has now been suppressed, but the bandits in Fuding County are still concentrated in the Taimu Mountain area and are quite rampant. The security team stationed in the county has also advanced from Bailin to suppress them, engaging in fierce battles with the bandits.</p>
<h3>Warning Letter Causes Elderly Man's Sudden Death in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Cao Fangqing, a merchant over fifty years old, was responsible for buying and selling rice at the Shengji Rice Shop in the West Beach for many years. Several days ago, his demeanor suddenly changed, and his spirits were low. After being questioned by his employer, it was revealed that he had received a warning letter from Yao Zhang, the mother of his daughter-in-law. The letter stated that her daughter had been married for three years and, although the couple's feelings were still good, she could not bear the abuse from her mother-in-law, so she had returned home in Ningbo and was studying at an adult women's school. The letter then listed various conditions, set a three-day deadline for a response, and requested that the reply be delivered to a Mr. Yang. Upon receiving the letter, Cao Fangqing became worried, anxious, and frightened, leading to an altered state. On the afternoon of the 12th, at 3:00 PM, when the warning period expired, Cao Fangqing's expression suddenly changed, and he died shortly after. Upon questioning his daughters-in-law, they claimed to be unaware of the situation, asserting that Mr. Yang was instigating the situation, inciting the ignorant Yao Zhang to resort to such measures. The Cao family is extremely indignant and will be lodging a complaint against the Yang family.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Thugs Impersonating Officials Arrested for Extortion</h3>
<p>Ni Ronggen, a well-known soil merchant from Xiaosanliqiao outside the North Gate of this county, was arrested by the Supervisory Office on July 9th last year. Over one hundred and forty taels of various opium dross and paste were seized, and he was sent to the court and sentenced to imprisonment. His wife, tempted by the high profits, continued to trade in opium, with thriving business. At 10:00 AM on the 9th of this month, two thugs, Yan A'da and Wang Fenglin, ordered the old woman Wang Xie, with three silver dollars and sixty copper coins, to buy an ounce of opium from the Ni family. At the same time, they led accomplices Wang Yiting and Yang Yongtai, claiming to be secret agents from the Supervisory Office, to search the premises. As a result, forty silver dollars (or four hundred, according to another account) were extorted, with thirty dollars still outstanding. When leaving, they were seen by another thug, Zhang Aisheng. Fearing exposure, they gave Zhang two silver dollars as hush money. The next day, Wang, the chief inspector, was secretly informed and arrested Gu A'da, Yang Yongtai, Wang Yiting, Zhang Aisheng, and Wang Xie, sending them to the Public Security Bureau and then to the local court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang to Improve Public Security Facilities in Various Counties</h3>
<p>In order to standardize and improve public security facilities in various counties, the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department has decided to convene meetings of public security administrative personnel from various counties in stages, starting on February 20th of this year, to discuss ways to improve public security. Counties with bureaus will be represented by the head of the county bureau or the director or section chief of the directly affiliated public security section. Each will prepare a report and proposal on the state of public security facilities in their county and submit them to the department by the end of the month for discussion at the meeting.

<h3>First Batch of Small Loans Approved</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Small Loan Office for Common People began issuing loans on the 5th. Approximately three to four thousand small business owners applied for loans, with a total loan amount of over forty thousand yuan. After review, only forty-four households were qualified. Based on the actual need for funds, the amounts were appropriately reduced, totaling over one thousand three hundred yuan, with the largest being two hundred yuan and the smallest being three yuan. Each household has been notified to complete loan papers and collect the funds.</p>
<h3>Changshu's Fourth District Famine Victims Riot Again</h3>
<p>Due to the severe drought last summer, the harvest in the county's various townships was drastically reduced. Some farmers, plagued by hunger and cold, have repeatedly launched famine riots. Fortunately, in the sixth district, the Party and government were able to suppress the situation, bringing it to an end. Unexpectedly, the fourth district in the west, due to negligence in inspection during the disaster assessment, was not listed as a severely affected area. However, the Yuluba area indeed had no harvest. On the 5th of this month, a famine riot occurred once. As a result, three or four hundred hungry men and women were each given ten copper coins and dispersed. Then, on the 11th, District Chief Xu Jingyu and others went to Zhoujia Wharf to compile and inspect the Baojia system. Villagers beat drums and gathered a crowd, assembling over three hundred people in a short time, demanding the exemption of rent and seeds and the distribution of winter relief. District Chief Xu promised to find a solution and immediately returned. However, the famine victims were dissatisfied and continued to go to the district office, demanding a responsible response. The district chief had not yet returned, so Assistant Zhao persuaded them. Fearing trouble, he urgently telegraphed the port Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to suppress them. Bureau Chief Cheng Jingchuan immediately rushed to the scene on horseback, but due to muddy roads, soaked from prolonged rains, he fell from his horse into the field and was seriously injured. At the district office in Xitangqiao, the district assistant ordered the farmers of each township to sign their names, awaiting submission to the county government to request winter relief. The famine victims signed the agreement, and were given six copper coins each before they dispersed.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu County Opium Prohibition Committee, after approval from the provincial capital, submitted to the seventh meeting the decision to add twenty opium dens in the urban area and to supplement the rural areas with fewer than five dens to have five each. The lot drawing was continued at the county government auditorium on the morning of the 12th. Opium Prohibition Committee members Zhou Guren, Dai Tianqiu, Zhang Shu, Dong Chengqi, and Committee Chairman Ma Zhenbang, License Section Chief Chang Shizhi, Yin Muguo, and others were present.

Those who won the lot were instructed to promptly report for business, while those who did not win could retrieve their previously paid deposits with the receipts issued at the time of application. It was also announced that Hu Min, a member of the committee, was impersonating and extorting six yuan per month from opium dens in the eastern countryside and has now fled. Anyone encountering similar cases of extortion should immediately report to the county government. Section Chief Chang then instructed those who won the lot in the rural areas to follow the procedures to obtain a license and start business within three days before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Taixian Rural Association Asks for the Prohibition of Private Collection of Land Tax</h3>
<p>Zhang, the Taixian magistrate and Taixian leader for assisting in the Huai River project, collected land taxes without the approval of the provincial department to pay for the project and the office expenses. The people of Taixian publicly elected Huang, the director of the six rural associations, to submit a request to the provincial finance department to prohibit the tax collection. Huang has submitted three requests, but it has been two months and the provincial government has not approved it, while the county still demands payment. The public is very angry and has prepared ten reasons to submit to Premier Wang, Committee leader Jiang, and the Jiangsu Party Department to ask the provincial government to make a decision as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Advises Private Letter Offices to Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>Private Letter Offices Held a Meeting Yesterday to Assist Baoshun Private Letter Office</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that the private letters sent from the main Private Letter Offices of Shanghai and other places to Wenzhou have been missing, and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has advised the Private Letter Offices to suspend operations again. The National Private Letter Businessmen held a general representative meeting yesterday to discuss methods to assist the Baoshun Private Letter Office and other matters. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Missing Private Letters Sent to Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Seven Private Letter Offices in this port, including Zhengda and Quansheng, have been specializing in private letters between Shanghai and Wenzhou. Since December 31st of this year, the last batch of private letters sent from Shanghai to Wenzhou have been missing, and the Wenzhou Private Letter Offices have not received any of them. The senders in Shanghai have been asking the Private Letter Offices, etc., and it has been more than ten days, but the whereabouts are still unknown and is being investigated.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Advises to Stop Business Again</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that most of the Private Letter Offices are located in Nanshi Xian Gua Street, within the jurisdiction of the police. In accordance with the central government's orders, it had previously sent personnel to advise them. Now that the deadline has passed, the offices are still operating as usual, which seems to violate the law. The Public Security Bureau of the 16th Division was instructed to implement it again, so the division specially summoned the representative of Yinyuantong on the afternoon of the previous day and advised them to end their operations on the same day and remove the signs of all the Private Letter Offices. The letter offices requested a postponement because the central government has not yet approved the petition order.</p>
<h3>Letter Offices from All Over Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Private Letter Offices have repeatedly petitioned the central government, but there has been no reply on whether to ban them or not. However, the post office has abolished the weighing regulations, and from January 1st of this year, if private letters are found again, they will be detained and punished. The letter offices are deeply panicked, so they held a general representative meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the final petition for relief, and attached the First Special District Court's verdict on the Baoshun Private Letter Office incident and decided to appeal.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Radio Station to be Established</h3>

According to Huang Qifa, a reporter from the Industrial and Commercial Daily, the Japanese authorities have recently intensified the expulsion of overseas Chinese and disregarded international law. Recently, Chinese overseas Chinese in Japan have been deeply insulted, and a large number of overseas Chinese will be expelled and returned to China. Now, their method of expelling Chinese overseas Chinese is changing. The overseas Chinese are arrested and sent to the police station, falsely accusing them of being spies, and then escorting them to the ship to return to China, in order to sweep away all the Chinese overseas Chinese in Japan.</p>

<h3>Xu Shiying Remitted 300,000 Yuan From Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Distributed to Various Provinces for Emergency Relief</p>
<p>The Drought Relief Association received a telegraph from Xu Shiying, the chairman of the Relief Committee, remitting 300,000 yuan for relief. (Omitted above) Mr. Chu Cang met with him and said that the emergency relief loan for the winter period had been signed with the Central Bank, and a check for 30,000 yuan had been issued to the Shanghai Central Bank. In addition, 250,000 yuan can be remitted within the lunar year. Please contact and ask the supervisors to arrive in Shanghai for details. The younger brother Ying bowed truthfully.

The Central Government has allocated 300,000 yuan, and the bank has informed us today to collect it and it has been remitted to various provinces. We beg that you will expedite the remittance of the remaining 250,000 yuan so that we can implement the original plan. Please expedite the sending of relief rice, relief clothing, and passports to the association as soon as possible, and return to Shanghai as soon as possible to preside over everything.

<h3>The General Association of Public Donations for Emergency Relief Urges Various Trade Associations to Pay</h3>
<p>Check the Receipts for the Street Fundraising by the Boy Scouts</p>
<p>The General Association of Public Donations for Emergency Relief, regarding the public donations for emergency relief from various trade associations, had previously formulated various amounts of 3,000, 2,000, 1,500, 500, 300, and 100 based on the scope and economic situation of each industry. It sent letters to various trade associations, responsible for acknowledging the donations. After receiving the letters, the trade associations immediately acknowledged the donations in accordance with the prescribed amount and sent the donations to the association, which was extremely enthusiastic. It has been reported in previous reports, and it can be seen that the business community is enthusiastically supporting public donations for emergency relief. However, a few trade associations have not completed the procedure. It is reported that the association has sent separate inquiry letters to various locations due to the fact that it is now severe winter and the disaster victims in various places are in urgent need of assistance, asking them to send the amount according to the previously determined amount immediately to the association in order to allocate it to the disaster area for relief. In addition, the General Association of Public Donations for Emergency Relief approved the Boy Scout Council to send to the association the receipt stubs for the public donations solicited by various groups in the streets on December 8th of last year and the unused receipts. The association specially sent personnel to check each one to ensure credibility, and the internal work has been extremely busy in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen's Association Sends a Letter to the Drought Disaster Association to Effectively Distribute Relief Funds</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen's Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Shanghai Drought Relief Association stating, "Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that your association has allocated relief funds according to the severity of the disaster in various places. Our province has also received 50,000 yuan. After reading this, I dare to represent the disaster victims in Sichuan in thanking you. However, it is difficult to raise funds, and it is even more difficult to distribute them. Therefore, I have to make some suggestions to your association. Our province's disasters include natural disasters and bandit disasters. Natural disasters are droughts and floods that occur from time to time, and the disaster areas cover various regions, and the disaster is extremely severe, and it is even more difficult to investigate in detail. Bandit disasters are the scourge of the Communist bandits. It has been found that the area ravaged by the Communist bandits is more than ten counties, and the disaster victims are nearly 100,000. Even those who have escaped alone and are gathered, waiting to be fed, are also hundreds of thousands. Regardless of natural disasters or bandit disasters, in this time of hunger and cold, the hope of relief is extremely urgent. Therefore, I deeply hope that this relief fund can be distributed quickly to benefit the disaster victims. Please pay attention to how this relief fund can be effectively distributed to the hands of the victims in order to conform to the original intention of philanthropists to contribute to save people. Your Excellency, I am sure that you are also thinking about this. I respectfully submit my humble opinion and hope that you will review it. I wish you peace. The Sichuan Fellow Countrymen's Association."</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Five Exchange Brokers Convened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unanimous Appeal to Petition for the Abolition of the Transaction Tax</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal to the Executive and Legislative Yuans to levy a transaction tax, news has spread, and various exchanges and brokerage associations in this city believe that in this time of economic depression and industrial decline, the operation of the exchanges is also sluggish. Maintaining the status quo is already difficult, and if taxes are paid again, the future of the business will be even more unimaginable. The true difficulties have been presented to the government authorities, requesting the abolition of the original proposal. It is now heard that the transaction tax case will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and implementation. The brokerage associations of various exchanges convened a joint emergency meeting of representatives of various associations at the Yizhixiang Restaurant yesterday to discuss remedial measures. The representatives included Wang Zhengru, Wu Limen from the Securities Exchange Association, Zhan Liansheng, Wang Yingchang, Wang Jiafu, Gao Qiumei, Zhang Zhusun from the Gold Exchange Association, Zhang Weiyun, Zhu Jiansheng, Xia Rongchang, Wang Zhongliang, Yang Jingcheng from the Flour Exchange Association, Chuan Changyu, Xue Chengzhang, Xu Jianqi from the Grain Exchange Association, Bian Futang, Wu Xunqing, Shao Wenyao, Zhang Bojin, Kuang Jian from the Gauze Exchange Association, and more than twenty others. First, Chairman Bian Futang reported on the process of the chairmen of various exchanges petitioning for the cancellation of the transaction tax, the latest news from the government on the case, and a detailed description of the current difficult operating conditions of the brokers. Then, the representatives present at the meeting all agreed that if the government implements the transaction tax in this severe economic downturn, the clients will be unable to bear it, and the brokers' business will inevitably fall into an irreversible predicament. At the same time, the industrial, commercial and financial sectors will suffer huge losses by losing this trading mechanism. It is hoped that the government will consider the overall situation, understand the difficulties of the merchants, and abolish the original proposal in order to maintain the status quo. It was unanimously passed by the whole body, and it was resolved that when necessary, the various associations would send representatives to accompany the chairmen of the various exchanges to Beijing to petition, and would not stop until the goal was achieved.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Municipal Government to Admonish and Detain Pawnbrokers</h3>
<p>It Is Necessary to Investigate the Origins of Pledged Items Detained by Pawnbrokers</p>
<p>Explicitly Acknowledged in the Court's Decision of Non-Prosecution</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of petitioning, on the 10th of this month, we received a letter from the Pawnbrokers Association stating that Wan Yuan Pawnshop on Baoshan Road, a member of the association, reported that at around 11:00 AM on November 20th of last year, the police from the North Railway Station Branch of the Public Security Bureau came to the shop to summon Xiao Xueyong, the manager of the shop, saying that a Mr. Li had reported to the bureau accusing the shop manager of concealing stolen goods for profit. They immediately went to the station to await interrogation. It was said that the reporting person, Li Tingzhang, a former patrol officer of the bureau, had a theft on November 15th, and issued a loss report on the 17th, accompanied by detectives to investigate various pawnshops without success. Later, they received a letter from the thief with two pawn tickets, which were found to be pawned at our shop. Therefore, they filed a complaint accusing our shop of concealing stolen goods for profit, etc. The shop manager saw that the clothing names and quantities on the pawn tickets were mostly inconsistent, and the most important sable-lined satin female robe on the loss report was not pawned at our shop. The rest were ordinary clothes that were difficult to distinguish. Before any explanation could be given, the personnel of the branch bureau forcibly detained him in the detention center, imprisoning him for three hours before being interrogated. The shop manager explained the errors in the case, the difficulty in identifying the facts, and the lack of intent to conceal the stolen goods. However, the interrogator of the branch bureau turned a deaf ear and ignored everything, as if they had already made up their mind. The shop manager requested that the original pawn records be retrieved for verification, and that the person who handled the pawning be brought in for questioning to clarify the facts, but was refused. All opportunities for evidence that criminal suspects should have were strictly blocked, and they were arbitrarily ordered to return to the pawnshop. The shop was extremely anxious due to the manager's detention and repeatedly requested bail pending trial, but all were rejected. On the evening of that day, the branch bureau escorted the shop manager to the Zhabei Branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, and then presented him to the General Bureau, which repeatedly transferred him, as if he were a serious criminal. It was not until the 22nd that the General Bureau approved bail. In total, the detention time lasted as long as forty-eight hours. He was yelled at and scolded, and suffered humiliation everywhere. The damage to his spirit cannot be overstated, etc., and arrived at the meeting. While verifying the matter, we received another letter from the shop stating that the case of the manager of our shop, Xiao Xueyong, being falsely accused of concealing stolen goods for profit by Li Tingzhang and being unjustly detained by the Public Security Bureau had been reported. The case has now been transferred by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation, and on December 28, 23rd year of the Republic, the court sent a decision of non-prosecution, declaring non-prosecution. It is very clear that our shop is not guilty. However, our shop was disturbed for no reason in its business, which is related to the future business of the industry. Therefore, we enclose a copy of the decision of non-prosecution and request verification and approval for handling. Enclosed is a copy of the decision of non-prosecution by the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, etc., and arrived at the meeting. Based on this, we found that our pawnbroker industry, mistakenly receiving stolen goods, according to Article 17 of the Pawnbroker Business Regulations promulgated by the Bureau of Social Affairs, should be reported by the victim to the authorities at the time and receive a stamped certificate, which can be used to redeem the goods at the pawnshop without paying interest, etc., and the Bureau of Social Affairs has also issued a public notice in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the method of handling this case by the North Railway Station Branch is indeed inappropriate. If this trend starts, and others follow suit, the pawnbroker industry will be in danger, and they will inevitably stop business together, which concerns the economy of the poor in society and the reputation of merchants. Therefore, we report the situation and request the Council to verify it and ask the Public Security Bureau to order its subordinates to be cautious when handling public cases in the future, and not to detain legitimate merchants with fixed business premises indiscriminately. We also request that it be forwarded to the Municipal Government for an order of protection to ensure commercial security and alleviate suffering, which would be in the public interest, etc., and arrived at the meeting. Business is a lending nature, and there is originally no intention to own it for oneself or a third party. There is no need to investigate the origins of pledged items. This is explicitly acknowledged in the decision of non-prosecution by the Shanghai Local Court, which is a fair and reasonable argument. Therefore, the Shanghai Pawnbroker Business Regulations only stipulate interest-free redemption for pawnshops that mistakenly receive stolen goods, which is consistent with the intention of the decision of non-prosecution. The North Railway Station Branch of the Public Security Bureau, in the case of Wan Yuan Pawnshop mistakenly receiving stolen goods, regarded it as knowingly buying stolen goods and applied criminal investigation procedures, which was close to rash. Moreover, since the pawnshop has a fixed business premise, there is no concern that it would falsely escape. However, the shop manager was arbitrarily detained for as long as forty-eight hours, which is contrary to the principle of protecting human rights. According to the previous situation, it is reasonable to submit a petition to your government for verification and approval, and to issue an order of protection so that legitimate merchants will not be harmed outside the law, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Land Bureau Announces Simplified Procedures for Surveying and Exchanging Certificates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau has an original planned procedure for surveying all the land in the city. Citizens often request surveying before the announcement of certificate exchange. The bureau is very concerned about the possibility of fraudulent occupation when handling applications for surveying from individual households in advance. Therefore, the handling is more cautious. According to custom, the owner must submit a petition stating the reasons for the survey and submit a single chain of deeds. After verifying that the single chain matches, a date is set for surveying. Citizens are unaware of the cumbersome procedures and misunderstand that the bureau is slow in handling matters, which is prone to misunderstandings. In order to facilitate the citizens, the bureau has specially drafted simplified procedures for handling owner's applications for surveying and certificate exchange, which have been submitted to the municipal government for record. The original text is now recorded below: Simplified procedures for the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau to handle owner's applications for surveying and certificate exchange: (1) When an owner applies for surveying and certificate exchange, they should send the field slip, grain chain, deed, or other evidence of property rights to the registration section of the fourth section of the bureau to obtain a receipt. If the slip is lost, a guarantee should be filled out and sent to the bureau for record together with three kinds of newspapers (Min Bao and Morning Post, Shen Bao or News) that published the lost slip advertisement. (2) After the owner obtains the receipt, they should present the receipt to the land clearing room of the third section, explain the reason for the survey, fill in the area, location and detailed address of the land, and pay the surveying fee and the land guarantee fee. (3) After the owner pays the surveying fee and other fees, they should present the receipt for verification. According to the number, a land clearing voucher will be issued, stating the surveying date and time, and arranging a waiting place. At the appointed time, the owner should come to the bureau on time, or at the waiting place, to meet the surveyor, and the bureau will notify the land guarantee to arrive at the site in advance. (4) For surveying land with a lost slip, the owner must first properly erect boundary stones. If it is found that the boundary stones have not been erected during the surveying, the surveying should be postponed until the boundary stones are erected, and the surveying fee and other fees should be paid again. (5) During the surveying, the owner should personally point out the boundaries, and after the land guarantee proves it, the land guarantee and the owner must sign on the survey book. (6) After setting the surveying date, if it rains at the appointed time and the surveying cannot be carried out, another surveying date will be set and the owner will be notified. If the owner does not arrive at the site to point out the boundaries during the surveying, the surveying fee should be paid again, and another surveying date will be set. (7) If the land to be surveyed is within the area that has already been surveyed and the certificate exchange has not yet been announced, the owner should identify the location when applying. If there is no error, the drawing will be made immediately and a notice will be issued for signature and acknowledgement. Only half of the surveying fee needs to be paid. (8) Anyone who presents the land license to the bureau and applies for separate surveying only needs to pay the surveying fee. If applying for division on the land certificate map, a division sketch should be attached, indicating the area of each plot, and half of the surveying fee must be paid. (9) If the owner's address changes after applying for surveying, they should immediately report it to the bureau. (10) If the slip and the land match for the land to be surveyed, the owner will be notified to come to the bureau to review the drawing within three months after the surveying. If the slip and the land do not match, or if there is a boundary dispute, the drawing will be made and the signature will be requested only after separate corrections are made. (11) After the owner signs and acknowledges the drawing and sends it to the bureau, the land certificate will be filled out within three months. If there is a surplus of land, the land certificate will be filled out within three months after the price is paid.</p>

If the mortgage is not redeemed after the registration expires, a lawsuit may be filed directly with the competent court.

(Article 8) If the mortgaged real estate is re-mortgaged to another person, the mortgage amount and the mortgage date shall not exceed the original mortgage amount and period. The registration procedures shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. (Article 9) After the mortgagor redeems the mortgaged land certificate, both parties must bring the redeemed land certificate to the bureau to cancel the registration, and the bureau will issue it to the original owner for safekeeping after indicating the cancellation and affixing the seal. (Article 10) If there are any matters not covered by these regulations, they may be amended temporarily. (Article 11) These regulations shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Map and Embankment Boundaries in This City</h3>
<p>Re-Demarcation and Determination of Boundaries in Four Districts Including South Shanghai</p>
<p>The scope of this city includes parts of the former Shanghai and Baoshan counties, so the names of each district, map and embankment are not uniform. Moreover, the original boundaries have either changed due to terrain, are difficult to examine due to being buried, or are mutually intertwined and extremely chaotic. In order to reorganize the map and embankment boundaries and unify the names, the original protection map and embankment numbers are abolished, and the boundaries are re-divided according to natural boundaries. The maps in each district are numbered with numbers such as one, two, three, and four, and the embankments are named in order of heaven, earth, yuan, and yellow. Each district is the beginning and end. The four districts of South Shanghai, Zhabei, Fahua, and Caojing have now been re-divided and determined after measurement. Other districts will also be re-divided and determined in order.</p>

<h3>Huang Hongjun Goes to the United States to Negotiate with Overseas Chinese to Return to the Country to Invest in Industry</h3>
<p>Raising Funds to Expand the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese All Highly Agree and Are Willing to Help Proceed</p>
<p>Shiye She Yun: Huang Hongjun, general manager of China Underwear Company, in view of the fact that overseas Chinese have been greatly squeezed out by various countries in recent years and are suffering greatly, in order to enable overseas Chinese to live and work in peace and contentment after returning to the country and achieve prosperity together, he intends to expand the scope of the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory he founded, giving overseas Chinese the opportunity to invest in established industries. The Shiye She reporter has learned the details and recorded them as follows:</p>
<h3>Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>The China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory founded by Huang Jun has been operating for fifteen years. Due to Mr. Yin's proper management, the achievements are remarkable. It is now planned to add 1.4 million yuan in capital, combining the original capital of 2 million yuan, to purchase 20,000 spinning spindles and 450 looms. It has also been decided to purchase 400 mu of land in Lu Jia Bang, near Shanghai, with 100 mu as the factory base, 100 mu to build staff and worker housing, 100 mu as a special model village, and 200 mu as a superior model village.</p>
<h3>Contacting Investment</h3>
<p>After the above plan was formulated, Mr. Huang went to the United States in August of last year to contact overseas Chinese for investment. Overseas Chinese organized the General Association for Assisting Overseas Chinese to Return to the Country to Develop Industry and elected Xie Dongyan as the chairman, Huang Dengxiu as the secretary, Zhao Junyao, Zhao Ruizhi, Lei Weirun, Chen Bailin, Liu Zhanbo, Tan Huimin, and Huang Dejiong as the executive committee members to actively promote and assist in the fundraising matters. It is also known that Mr. Huang will soon leave San Francisco and continue to Chicago, Boston, New York, and other places to contact overseas Chinese for investment procedures, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in April of this year.</p>
<h3>Building a Model Village</h3>
<p>According to Tang Qiongxiang, the vice president of the company, to the Shiye She reporter, the company's fundraising and expansion are entirely for the sake of overseas Chinese. Therefore, it is specially stipulated that for every 10,000 yuan invested, 1.5 mu of model village land will be given to the overseas Chinese for building residential houses, so that they can live and work in peace and contentment and gather together. In addition, shareholders also have various benefits to enjoy endlessly.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approves That It Is Difficult to Levy a Uniform Tax on Rayon Interwoven Fabrics</h3>
<p>Da Gong She Yun: The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, suggesting that a uniform tax be re-imposed on rayon interwoven fabrics in order to maintain the dying livelihood of silk merchants. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance approved the association, saying: "The uniform tax is an ex-factory tax. There are no factories in the country that manufacture rayon. It is inconsistent with the principle of levying a uniform tax. If a uniform tax is opened only for rayon interwoven fabrics, each interwoven product must be identified, which will cause many difficulties. Moreover, weaving factories that use rayon as raw material are very scattered and not concentrated. Investigation is not easy and management is very difficult. Taking care of one thing and losing sight of another will result in more omissions than levies, which will still not help. The main reason for the failure of China's silk industry is the severance of overseas sales channels and the drop in silk prices, not entirely due to the proliferation of rayon. Currently, the tax rate on rayon is already over 60% ad valorem. The higher the tax rate, the more difficult it is to prevent smuggling. Therefore, increasing taxes will not protect the export of silk. The various points raised by the association are kept for reference."</p>
<h3>The Cigarette Anti-Smuggling Association Revises the Touring Inspection Methods</h3>
<p>Xin Xin She Yun: The Tax Bureau's Cigarette Anti-Smuggling Assistance Committee convened a committee meeting yesterday (12th) at the Tax Bureau on the second floor of the Jianghai Customs to discuss revising the touring inspection methods.

Dong Zhongding chaired the meeting, He Fangliang recorded the meeting, and after the ceremony, the original text was revised as follows: (1) When the special inspectors and investigators of various districts are conducting touring inspections, they should all abide by these methods. (2) Touring inspections, in addition to the original designated inspection areas, may also be dispatched at any time to other provinces and regions when deemed necessary. (3) The special inspectors will be temporarily appointed by the Tax Bureau, and the number will not be fixed for the time being. The investigators will be dispatched by the Bureau or the Cigarette Anti-Smuggling Assistance Committee, taking into account the situation in each province and region, with a limit of five to ten people each for the time being. They will be responsible for touring investigations of all illegal cigarettes' manufacturing, sales, and transportation. If the affairs are complicated and insufficient distribution, they may be appropriately increased at any time. (4) When investigators are on duty, if they encounter the following circumstances, they should immediately report to the Bureau and the Assistance Committee: (A) The sale, transportation, or manufacture of iron hand-cranked cigarette machines that are absolutely prohibited. (B) Wooden hand-cranked machines that are purchased or transported privately. (C) Registered cigarette households that secretly establish brand names or sell fake products when manufacturing cigarettes. (D) Soil tobacco shredding shops that privately supply silk for cigarette making. (E) Shops in various places that illegally transport and sell tax-evading cigarettes and all raw materials for various cigarettes (cured tobacco leaves, cured tobacco silk, and handmade cigarette paper). (F) Ships, trains, and transportation companies that transport and unload all tax-evading or illegal tobacco products (tobacco leaves and tobacco silk) and various cigarette papers for customers. (G) Non-cured tobacco producing area registered curing tobacco silk shops that privately purchase cured tobacco leaves and shred them into cured tobacco silk for sale. (H) Other violations of various cigarette regulations and various methods. (5) When the special inspectors and investigators are dispatched to conduct touring investigations, they should fill in the investigation ten-day report form and submit it to the Bureau and the Assistance Committee every ten days for verification. However, each time they arrive at a place (counties and towns), they should also prepare a report stating the location and time of arrival and submit it in advance. On the one hand, they should purchase a five-cent postage stamp from the local postal agency and retrieve the stamped receipt as proof, which should be attached to the report and submitted. (6) If the Tax Bureau believes that it is necessary to order special personnel to handle the case based on the investigator's report, the special personnel should immediately go to the area and cooperate with the relevant authorities to earnestly handle the case. However, when necessary, the Tax Bureau may also dispatch personnel directly to conduct investigations at any time, depending on the circumstances. (7) When necessary, the special personnel may hire a clerk to assist with clerical work. (8) When special personnel are dispatched to handle cases in various places, if the investigator's testimony is required, the investigator should report the actual situation in detail for assessment. When necessary, they should still do their best to assist in the investigation. (9) If there are any matters not covered by these methods, the Tax Bureau may add them at any time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South District Businesses Jointly Request Approval of Rental Standards</h3>
<p>Maintaining the Market and Eliminating Disputes</p>
<p>Da Gong She Yun: Wan Mao Xiang, Xie Yuan Xiang, Feng Tai He, Fu Cheng, He Tai, Yuan Lai, Xin Xin, Xie Yuan, Xie He, Feng Chun, Hua Xiang, Jin Yuan, De Ji, Yuan Yuan, Xin Shun Ji, Bao Xing, Liang Dong Sheng, Yi Cheng, Shi Cheng, Da Cheng, Xiao He Xing, Chen Yi Ji, Hui Tai, Cui Chang Tai, Xie Feng, Chang He, Rui Feng Mao, De Yuan, He Kang, Jing Heng Mao, Long Mao, Yu Da, Qian Rui Ji, Xiao Chun Ji, Da Shun, Xu Hou Ji, Cui Yuan, Heng Shun, and other businesses in Shanghai South District, 16th Pier, jointly signed and presented to the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government's Rental Dispute Mediation Committee, requesting that the arbitrary rent increases and illegal demands of various landlords be prohibited, and that rental standards be approved and ordered to be observed in order to maintain the market and eliminate disputes (the original text is very long, omitted).</p>
<h3>Dongjiadu Ferry Workers Union Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Union Funds Require a Meeting</p>
<p>Criminal Case Becomes a Civil Case</p>
<p>The ferry workers union at the Dongjiadu wharf in Pudong elected Zhao Agou as a standing committee member and Zhao Quanfu as the finance committee member two years ago (1933). Last year (1934), a re-election was held, and Ji Hegui was elected as standing committee member, while Zhang Linfa managed the finances. Recently, Ji Hegui sued Zhao Agou, Zhao Quanfu, and others at the Shanghai District Procuratorate for embezzlement of public funds, claiming that after the defendants left their positions, they should have handed over the union's remaining public funds of over 2,300 yuan in full, but they refused under various pretexts, intending to embezzle them. However, the defendants submitted a defense, stating that the union had been banned by the party department and was now suspended, and the funds were indeed in their custody, but a meeting of all committee members must be convened before they could be handed over, as they could not be transferred privately. Both sides held to their own accounts. After investigation by the prosecutor, a decision was made not to prosecute. Ji Hegui, dissatisfied with the decision, appealed to the Jiangsu High Court for reconsideration. The High Court rejected the appeal, stating that union funds should be handled through meetings, and if there were disputes, they should be resolved through civil court proceedings, as no criminal embezzlement had occurred. The original decision not to prosecute was deemed appropriate, and the request for reconsideration was without merit and should be rejected. Therefore, Ji Hegui hired someone to draft a petition to the District Court Mediation Tribunal, requesting mediation. A summons was issued, but the opposing party did not appear, resulting in no resolution. It is reported that Ji Hegui will hire a lawyer to file a formal lawsuit according to the law.</p>

<h3>Xu Ruikuan Accuses Neighbor of Abducting and Selling His Son</h3>
<p>Xu Ruikuan, a native of Yancheng, resides in a straw hut without a number in Yuquegang, Dapu Road, Nanshi. He is in his forties and makes a living pulling a rickshaw. He married a woman surnamed Lü, and their only son, nicknamed Dayazi, is only four years old. On the afternoon of November 29th of the old calendar year, at about 4:00 PM, Dayazi was sold by Qian Zhuizi, a fellow rickshaw puller and fellow villager, and his accomplice Wang Delin, to the Chen family at No. 7, a certain street on Tongfu Road in the International Settlement, reportedly for a price of 30 yuan. After the boy Dayazi suddenly disappeared, Xu Ruikuan and his wife asked relatives and friends to search for him, but to no avail. On the afternoon of December 5th of the old calendar year, at 10:00 PM, Liu Zihong, a fellow Yancheng native residing with them, and Ma Dawu, a fellow villager residing in a straw hut east of Dapu Bridge, sent a letter to Xu Ruikuan, saying that his son Dayazi had been taken away by Qian Xiaokai (i.e., Qian Zhuizi) and that 15 yuan was needed to redeem Dayazi. Xu Ruikuan was overjoyed and immediately tried to raise the 15 yuan. The next day, he took the money to the Sanxinglou Tea Garden on Dapu Road to wait for his son to be redeemed, but waited until late at night without seeing anyone bring Dayazi back. Therefore, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 4:00 PM, he found Qian Zhuizi, Liu Zihong, Ma Dawu, and others who resided with him, and went to the Rihuichiao Police Station of the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accusing Qian Zhuizi and the other two of colluding to kidnap his son Dayazi. Officer Zheng sent a police officer to accompany the plaintiff Xu Ruikuan to search for the fugitive Ma Dawu in the straw shed east of Dapu Bridge the night before, but was unsuccessful. Ma's wife, a Yancheng native surnamed Xia, was taken to the police station and, along with the others, was sent to the West Gate Branch for interrogation yesterday morning. The defendants Qian Zhuizi and Liu Zihong both admitted that they had taken Dayazi away and sold him for money. However, the buyer surnamed Chen had moved away, and the whereabouts of the fugitive accomplice Wang Delin and Dayazi were unknown. After hearing the confession, Chief Li determined that the case involved kidnapping and extortion, as well as the abduction and sale of human beings, separating family members. In addition to reporting the situation to the General Bureau for record-keeping, he also handed over the three men and women, including Qian Zhuizi, to the head of the Detective Squad stationed at the bureau, Shen Wenda, for a swift and thorough investigation. He also ordered the detective foreman Fang Lingen to be responsible for investigating and arresting the fugitive accomplices, and to bring them to justice at the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Rickshaw Registration, Rickshaw Businessmen Hold General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>New Rickshaws Too Heavy, Rickshaw Pullers Express Opposition</p>
<p>Because most rickshaw pullers opposed registration, the Special Zone Rickshaw Association held a regular meeting the night before last at 8:00 PM. Over twenty people attended, including Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, and Hou Shaoan. Gu Songmao chaired the meeting. As a result of the discussion, rickshaw pullers were advised to register, and a general meeting of members was scheduled for today. The association issued a notice to all rickshaw owners, stating that the office had resolved at the 66th board meeting to convene a member discussion meeting at the association's address at 2:00 PM on January 14th to discuss rickshaw registration and important cases regarding leased vehicles. Members were urged to attend on time, as the matter concerned their vital interests and should not be neglected. Furthermore, since the implementation of the 131 new rickshaws on New Year's Day, rickshaw pullers have expressed opposition because (1) the style is too luxurious, and most passengers suspect that they are privately owned or "wild chicken" chartered cars, so they dare not inquire, and business is slow; (2) the weight is too heavy, and the pulling time is longer for the same section of road, resulting in the daily business being less than half of the old rickshaws. Therefore, they are requesting the owners to continue to rent out the old rickshaws. The rickshaw owners plan to raise the issue for discussion at the general meeting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County to Convert Qiansan Township Road into Motor Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government is planning to build the Beidong (Beiqiao to Chegou) and Qiansan (Qianjingmiao Ferry to Sanlintang) township roads in order to benefit the people. The county government has received a letter from Mr. Liu Jiping, a local notable, requesting that the Qiansan township road be expanded into a motor road in sections. A preliminary plan and budget have been drawn up, with the Qianhua section (from Qianliangmiao to Huajing) being built first. County Magistrate Pan convened a temporary meeting of the Construction Committee yesterday to discuss the matter. A resolution was passed to widen the section from Qianliangmiao to the Huangpu River to ten shichi, and the part to be expanded along the original route will not be compensated separately. The newly opened part where there is no original road will be compensated at a price of 70 yuan per mu, based on the land price of Beihui Road. The costs of all bridges and culverts will be raised separately by the county and the local area after the roadbed is built.</p>

<h3>Walker Pan Deming to Return to China</h3>
<p>Has Departed from America and is Walking to Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Late May</p>
<p>The young walker Pan Deming joined the China Youth Asia Walking Group five years ago and set off from Shanghai. There were many participants at the time, but all dropped out one after another due to insufficient physical strength. By the time they reached French Annam, only Mr. Pan was left. Mr. Pan not only did not let the withdrawal of all his companions dampen his spirit, but instead was inspired to strive for the ambition of walking around the world. According to information from Mr. Huang Jingwan, an educator in Shanghai, and Mr. Zhang, a relative of Mr. Pan, after Mr. Pan arrived in the United States last autumn, the American newspapers competed to report on Mr. Pan's completion of the twenty-nine-country journey and praised him as a "Chinese hero." He has traveled through countries such as England, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Annam, Switzerland, and India, enduring great hardships along the way. Mr. Pan has now departed from America and is walking to Soviet Russia, returning to China via Siberia. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late May.</p>
<h3>Remarkable Feat of Students from Xin'an Elementary School Touring the Country</h3>
<p>Departure Around the Spring Holiday for a Ten-Province Grand Tour</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Xin'an Elementary School is the first school in Jiangbei to implement life education. Last year, seven students from the school, the oldest being thirteen years old and the youngest being eight years old, automatically organized a tour group. Without parents or teachers leading them, they walked to Shanghai, making a living by selling books, and returned to Xin'an safely and soundly. This is truly rare. Yesterday, the principal of the school, Wang Dazhi, came to Shanghai to visit major factories to study their management and equipment, so that he could focus more on production and construction training in the future. The reporter met Mr. Wang at the hotel yesterday, and he told me that ten students from the school will automatically depart around the spring holiday this year to undertake a grand tour of the country. Starting from Xin'an, they will travel through ten provinces, including Lu, Ji, Cha, Sui, Shan, Yu, Wan, E, and Xiang, making a living by selling books and not requiring anyone to lead them. As for the seven students who walked to Shanghai last time, they are currently editing a report, which is over 100,000 words long and will be printed soon.</p>
<h3>Master of Taoshan Dance Hall, Akashi Seigi, Assassinated</h3>
<p>The Murderer, Toyono Kosaburo, Surrendered</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News yesterday, on the night of the 12th, at 9:00 PM, Akashi Seigi, the owner of the Taoshan Dance Hall and a member of the executive committee of the Japanese Restaurant Association in this city, was suddenly stabbed with a sharp knife by Toyono Kosaburo, the owner of an early sushi restaurant in the Geisha Theatre on North Sichuan Road, as he was leaving the meeting room on the upper floor of the Wenlu Cafe. Akashi endured the pain and wrestled with Toyono, blood splattering on the walls. He then fell down the stairs. The people upstairs rushed over upon hearing the noise and immediately sent Akashi to the Shinozaki Hospital. Because he was stabbed in the heart from behind, he died shortly after. The perpetrator, Toyono, immediately went to the Japanese Consulate General to surrender. The cause of the stabbing is believed to be related to the Japanese Residents Association councilor election or other complex relationships. The police authorities of the Japanese Consulate General are currently investigating. If there are complex relationships involved, the incident is bound to escalate in the future. Akashi Seigi graduated from Meiji University and founded the China Enterprise Communications Agency. He was later appointed as the Shanghai branch manager. In 1928, he established the Taoshan Dance Hall and is currently a member of the Residents Association council. Taoshan was also quite active in this Japanese Residents Association election campaign. He was only forty-five years old and was a rising star among the Japanese residents.</p>
<h3>Destitute Man, Lacking Even a Grain of Rice, Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Severely Injured, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Xu Jinxi, a native of Yancheng, lives at No. 51, Beixingfa Li, Yangjiabang Road, Zhabei. His wife is surnamed Xu, and his father is Xu Zhaocheng, and his mother is surnamed Wang. Due to poverty, both father and son rely on doing odd jobs for a living, but their income is limited, and they often face the danger of running out of food. Yesterday at noon, Xu Zhaocheng saw that there was no rice at home and that his pockets were empty, so he asked Jinxi for money to buy rice, but Jinxi was also empty-handed and unable to respond. This led to a disagreement between father and son. Afterwards, Jinxi was ashamed and angry, and suddenly had a desperate thought. He used a razor to slash his own throat, and blood flowed profusely. He fainted and fell to the ground. Fortunately, his wife discovered him and rushed to inform his parents, who then went to the police station to report the incident. The police sent a car to take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the injury, his life is in danger. Xu Zhaocheng and his wife, surnamed Wang, were summoned to the police station for questioning after the incident.</p>
<h3>Magnificent New House Coveted by Robbers, Young Master Shot</h3>
<p>Hit in a Vital Area, Life Hanging by a Thread</p>
<p>Gao Asong, a local, is 55 years old. Gao's ancestors owned a lot of farmland in the Hongqiao area, so Asong has a good reputation for wealth. Recently, he built a Shikumen residence on a plot of land he owned at the west end of the junction of Foch Road and Curbtis Road in the French Concession, decorated in a magnificent style. Unexpectedly, this attracted the envy of the bandits. Yesterday morning at about 2:00 AM, four bandits speaking local dialect and wearing blue cloth short clothes suddenly broke into Gao's house through the front door. Two of the bandits had pistols, and the other two had sharp knives. They were about to carry out a search when Gao's second son, Gao Abao (20 years old), who was lying downstairs, heard the alarm and turned on the electric light. As he attempted to resist, one of the robbers, in a moment of desperation, pulled out a pistol and fired at Abao, hitting him in the left flank. He fell to the ground. By the time Asong and the people in the house heard the noise and rushed downstairs, they saw Abao lying in a pool of blood in the hall, barely breathing. The robbers had already disappeared. Gao reported the incident to the French Concession police, and the head of the police immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They then took Abao to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but because he was hit in a vital area, his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Counterfeit Currency Gangsters</h3>
<p>Detained and Sent to the French Concession Police for Questioning</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, a Chinese detective in the Hongkou Hui Si Police District arrested a Chinese man on Wednesday night, carrying about a thousand counterfeit banknotes of various kinds. These banknotes were hidden in the various compartments of a wide leather belt. There were about three hundred 20-franc notes, as well as several kinds of local national currency notes. The rest were 10-franc notes. The man claimed at the time that he came from Brazil, had lived in Vietnam, and had only recently come to Shanghai. He said that he had bought the banknotes from a passenger on the ship to Shanghai and did not know that they were counterfeit. However, the detective did not believe him and decided to detain him for further questioning. Later, some of the seized banknotes were sent to the French Concession General Police Station for verification. The police station said that they wanted to interrogate the man, so he was sent there. After three hours of interrogation, neither the Public Concession authorities nor the French Concession police authorities were willing to say much about the matter. It was learned last night that they are now pursuing the matter in order to uncover the organization that is using counterfeit currency in various places in the Far East.</p>
<p>According to the Zilin News, there have recently been some counterfeit one-yuan banknotes of a certain bank in circulation in this city, especially in the Yulin Road area. Detectives from the Public Works Department police have been investigating for several days, but have not yet captured the criminals using them. It is said that these counterfeit banknotes are manufactured very well, and it is difficult to distinguish them from the real ones without careful inspection.</p>
<h3>Special Court II Issues Arrest Warrant for Fugitive Felon</h3>
<p>Chen Jinlan, a native of Yong, nicknamed Shepi Jinlan, a murderer, was arrested by the French Concession police in his hometown in December of that year after fleeing the scene of the shooting of Chen Zhikui, the owner of Qianfengtai Candle Shop, with Zhu Quanxing, a native of Wuxi, at around 9:00 PM on April 14 of the previous year. He was brought to Shanghai and sent to the Special Court II for prosecution on charges of murder. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. The defendant was not satisfied and appealed to the High Court III Branch, but the result was rejected. Still not satisfied, he appealed to the Supreme Court. The defendant was therefore detained in cell No. 11 of the heavy criminal department of the detention center of the Special Court II, pending execution and imprisonment after the conclusion of the third trial. After the Supreme Court concluded the trial, the sentence was reduced to 12 years in prison. Just as the High Court III Branch was preparing to submit the case for execution after the judgment was issued, the defendant took advantage of the guards' negligence between 3:00 and 7:00 AM on December 27 of last year and escaped from prison without a trace. It was not discovered until he reached Kaifeng. Gao Xiaoxu, the warden, was furious upon learning of this and transferred the six guards on duty, both inside and outside, Fang Yuqi and Zhou Wenjin, and the guards who were suspected of being involved in the shift change, both inside and outside, Yang Xingcun, Wang Guanghe, Han Haorui, and Yan Ling, to the Procuratorate of the Special Court II for investigation and interrogation. These events have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that Wang Simo, the president of the Special Court II, and Chen Beisan, the chief prosecutor, believing that Chen was an important criminal in a murder case and should not be allowed to escape the law, issued an arrest warrant the day before yesterday, requesting the police department and notifying the military police and judicial organs in neighboring counties and ports to cooperate in arresting the fugitive and bringing him to justice.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Vendor Angrily Chops Adulterer</h3>
<p>Someone Snores on the Bed</p>
<p>The Adulterer is Seriously Injured, the Wife is Slightly Injured</p>
<p>Bai Laosi, a native of Anhui, 43 years old, lives with his wife Bai Zhou (30 years old, a native of Nanjing) and their children at No. 94, Maiqi Road, French Concession. Bai makes a living by selling vegetables. He goes out at 2:00 AM every day to wholesale vegetables and returns home at 5:00 AM to sort them out before taking them to the vegetable market on Maiqi Road to sell. This has been his routine for a long time. Li Zhijia, a fellow villager of Bai who lives at No. 6, Lane 128, Ju Pules Road, is 47 years old and guards a water pavilion (i.e., manages an artesian well) at No. 159, Lane 159, Haige Road. Because he often asked Bai to buy vegetarian vegetables, he often went to Bai's house and became close to Bai's wife. Over time, the two developed a love affair. Li often took advantage of Bai's absence to sell vegetables at midnight to go to Bai's house for a secret rendezvous with Zhou, while Bai remained oblivious. At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, Li again followed his usual practice and waited for Bai Laosi to go out before going to Bai's house to continue his affair with Bai's wife. At 5:00 AM, Bai returned home to sell vegetables and caught sight of Li and his wife sleeping in the same bed. He couldn't help but be consumed by jealousy. He grabbed a bamboo pole used to carry vegetables and beat Li and Zhou in bed. Because the two resisted, Bai, in a moment of desperation, grabbed a sharp knife used to sell vegetables and stabbed Li in the lower abdomen, plunging it several inches deep. He also stabbed Zhou in the right arm and right leg. Li and Zhou felt the pain and shouted for help. The second landlord reported the incident to the police station, and detective Xu Jinlong rushed to the scene, arresting Bai and taking him, along with the murder weapon and bamboo pole, to the police station. The injured were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At noon that day, Bai was sent to the Criminal Court I of the Special Court II, where he was interrogated by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. The police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, requesting a postponement until the victims recovered and requested a trial. When questioned, Bai confessed that he committed the crime because Li had an affair with his wife. The detective then reported the process of arresting the defendant, saying that Zhou's injuries were minor, while Li's injury was in the lower abdomen and was very serious, requesting a postponement. The court verified the report and approved the postponement of the trial, ordering the defendant to be detained and waiting for the court to go to the hospital to question the victim for further verification.</p>
<h3>Pan Rongfu's Case Against Zhou Xinzong Overturned on Appeal</h3>
<p>Zhou Xinzong Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>The Civil Portion Also Dismissed</p>
<p>Pan Rongfu, a native of Dinghai County, Zhejiang, residing at No. 12, Fuxu Fang, Foch Road, runs the Pan Rongji Construction Factory. He previously hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a complaint with the First Special Court against Zhou Xinzong, a native of Yin County who worked as a supervisor, for breach of trust and embezzlement of over 7,000 yuan. The Special Court sentenced Zhou to six months in prison and ordered him to compensate the full amount. Zhou, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and others to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, arguing that the accounts received had actually been handed over to Pan Rongji, and citing the fact that Pan had admitted in another case that he had received the money, in order to prove the inappropriateness of the first instance judgment and requesting that it be overturned. The other day, presiding judge Yu Hua and judges Zhou and Wu came to the court to hear the case clearly and announced the judgment, the main text of which stated: "The portion of the original judgment concerning Zhou Xinzong's crime and punishment is revoked, Zhou Xinzong is not guilty, and the other appeals are rejected." The attached civil suit regarding embezzlement was also pronounced at the same time, and the original judgment was revoked and the lawsuit filed by the appellee Pan Rongji against Zhou Xinzong in the first instance to recover the money was dismissed. The judgment was delivered to both parties yesterday. The reasons for the criminal portion of the judgment are excerpted as follows: "The appellant Zhou Xinzong served as a supervisor for the plaintiff Pan Rongfu's construction factory, receiving 7,850 yuan from the Hwayeh Trust Company for the cost increase, and the Hwayeh Company issued a check for the same amount dated September 13 from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to Zhou for receipt. The money was cashed in full. This is an undisputed fact. The only thing that needs to be investigated is whether Zhou transferred the check to Pan. As for the transfer between the two parties, there was no fixed method. One claimed that it had been transferred, the other claimed that it had not, and they only argued with empty words. Therefore, the suspicion of his crime cannot be proven, and the benefit should go to the defendant. Moreover, according to the testimony of witness Li Jinjun, an additional 8,200 yuan was issued on September 2 with the No. 50 receipt certificate. On September 22, a certificate for 10,000 yuan was re-issued. On the No. 51 receipt certificate, the 8,200 yuan was included in the previously received item. Pan signed and acknowledged it. If the No. 50 receipt certificate was not paid, he could not issue the No. 51 certificate. Between the issuance of the two certificates, Pan's representative, Di Atu, came, and he had informed him that 7,850 yuan had been paid for the 8,200 yuan increase, and 350 yuan had been temporarily withheld because some work had not been completed. Pan had already signed and acknowledged that the money opened on certificate No. 50 had already been received on certificate No. 51, and between September 2 and September 22, Li Jinjun clearly informed Pan's representative that the actual amount of 7,850 yuan had been issued and 350 yuan had been temporarily withheld. Therefore, before September 22, Pan already knew that the money had been issued, so he was willing to sign certificate No. 51. Referring to Pan's statement in the case of suing Hwayeh Company for arrears, it was briefly stated that 8,200 yuan had been added to the account, and the applicant had already signed and received it on Li Jinjun's receipt certificate, and it had already been concluded. Therefore, Pan's claim that Zhou received 7,850 yuan and that he was unaware of it is difficult to believe. The original judgment's evidence for Zhou Xinzong's crime of embezzlement in business is insufficient, and the appeal on that part should be considered reasonable. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made in accordance with Articles 384, 379, 316, 507, and 385(1) of the Criminal Procedure Law." As for the reasons for the civil portion of the judgment, the civil suit was based on the occurrence of a criminal act. Since the criminal act had determined that Zhou Xinzong had no embezzlement, he should not be held responsible for returning the money. The original judgment ordering Zhou to return 7,850 yuan was unfounded and should be revoked.</p>

<p>Reported to the Court for Autopsy</p>
<p>At 8:10 AM yesterday morning, an unidentified young male corpse who had been assassinated was suddenly discovered in a small river near the east of the Fanwangdu Railway Station in western Shanghai. There were five or six knife wounds on his head and face, with blood flowing profusely. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Discovery of the Corpse</h3>
<p>An unidentified male corpse was suddenly discovered in a small river on the east side of No. 1, the raised flag south of the Fanwangdu Railway Station in western Shanghai. The corpse was lying face up in the water. A villager passing by saw it and immediately reported it to the nearby police, who in turn reported it to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau. Director Wang, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched patrol officers Long and Yang, along with Detective Team Leader Geng Shoubao, squad leader Cao Chuqiao, and detective Zhang Shaoming, to investigate.</p>
<h3>Gruesome Scene of Assassination</h3>
<p>The unidentified young male corpse was found lying face up in the river, with his head to the northwest and feet to the southeast. He had a fair and elongated face and was about twenty years old. He was wearing a white绒短衫 (dun duan shan - short jacket), with a green striped Western-style shirt underneath, and gray毛葛夾袴 (mao ge jia ku - lined trousers). Underneath the trousers, he had white绒布袴 (rong bu ku - fleece cloth pants). He was wearing酱色毛綫襪 (jiang se mao xian wa - maroon wool socks) and black套鞋 (tao xie - overshoes). He had a Western-style hairstyle. There were two knife wounds on the back of his neck, one knife wound on the top of his head, one knife wound directly below, one knife wound next to his right neck, and one knife wound on his forehead, for a total of six wounds. Later, a呢帽 (ni mao - felt hat) was found in the railway with the dead man's hair. There was a circle of blood stains in the middle of the road, suggesting that he was assassinated there and then the body was moved and dumped in the river.</p>
<h3>Reporting the Autopsy and Apprehending the Murderer</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, Director Wang not only reported it to the Public Security General Bureau but also ordered the local 保 (bao - neighborhood head) to report it to the local court for autopsy.

<h3>Bihan Institute Requests Assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhang Zixin, the director of Bihan Institute, wrote to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting increased fundraising due to the increasing number of poor people in the institute and the urgent need for funds, and requesting the transfer of subsidies from the Municipal Government to the Finance Bureau for prompt disbursement. The original letter stated: "As of the 10th of this month, the Chaozhou Guildhall and Chaozhou-Huishan Villa have a total of 2,130 people. People seeking shelter continue to crowd into the institute. However, due to the difficulty of managing and providing for women and children, we do not have facilities for women, which makes it difficult for the Municipal Public Security Bureau to accept them. The donated cotton clothing and trousers from various charities are far from sufficient to be fully distributed. The daily requirement for rice is currently over 16 shi. Various expenses are very high. The institute's expenses have no fixed source of funds and rely entirely on fundraising. We are very grateful to your bureau for ordering the water stove industry in the city to send donations, which has been numerous. The weather is getting colder day by day, and the number of people seeking shelter is increasing day by day, and the need is very urgent. The municipal government has allocated 3,000 yuan, and the institute has sent staff to the Finance Bureau to claim it, but after several trips, there is no definite date for disbursement. We earnestly request that your bureau transfer the matter to the Finance Bureau for prompt disbursement to meet the urgent need, and we hope to expand fundraising, especially for cotton clothing and trousers, and we hope to solicit assistance. In addition to submitting this report to the chairman of our institute's committee for review, we are sending this letter to you, hoping you will consider and handle it and reply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Chinese Arts and Sciences Society Holds a Banquet for Zhuang Xueben, Who Investigated the Northwest</h3>

<p>Hu Boxiang and others from the Chinese Arts and Sciences Society held a banquet at Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road the night before last to welcome Zhuang Xueben, who had recently returned from his investigation of the Northwest. In addition to Mr. Zhuang, those present included Yan Duhe, Huang Tianpeng, Lang Jingshan, Hu Bozhou, Zhu Shoren, Shao Yizhi, etc. Mr. Zhuang described in detail his journey that began last spring from Guanxian, passing through Wenchuan, Weizhou, Lifan, Shigu Nao, crossing the Hongqiao Mountain, passing through the Sanhechang Grassland, arriving at San Elo (Guoloke) at the end of July, crossing the Kunlun Mountains and passing Yangbo Ridge in September, passing through Songpan and Maoxian, and returning along the Dijiangyuan Road, arriving in Chengdu in December. The local customs, human feelings, and products of the places he passed were very different from those of the interior. The photos have been scattered in pictorial publications such as the Shen Bao Pictorial Special Issue, News, China Pictorial Magazine, and Oriental Magazine. Mr. Zhuang already has over 100,000 words of travel notes and thousands of photos, which will be published soon. Mr. Zhuang will go to Beijing soon to report everything to the Northwest Development Association. After that, he will stay in Beijing and Shanghai for two or three months to sort out his travel notes, photos, luggage, etc., in preparation for his second investigation of the Northwest. The planned route will be farther than the first time, starting from Chengdu, passing through Kangding, Ba, Changdu, Lhasa, Tashilhunpo, Dan'a, returning via Lhasa, Yushu, and San Elo, and then returning by another route. The return trip will take at least a year and a half.</p>
<h3>National Products Factory Association Requests the Return of National Exhibition Items</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association replied to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent yesterday, stating, "Approved letter opened, stating that the goods seized by this customs from the Xin Ningshao ship were privately carried by the ship's crew. If the price of the goods is fined one time, together with the transit tax, it can be released." After investigation, the goods seized by your customs from the Xin Ningshao ship were indeed carried by the factory representatives and were not privately carried by the ship's crew. When seized, the staff of our association stated to the customs officers that they were goods returned from the Ningbo National Products Exhibition. On that day, most of the goods returned by more than 200 people were tax-exempt and packed in boxes. Because the representatives on the ship had scattered goods, they were not packed in boxes and were carried with them, resulting in this miscalculation. Therefore, we hereby send another letter stating that we request tax-exempt return to alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South National Products Exhibition Extends Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South National Products Exhibition, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, has been very popular since its opening, despite the weather not being very good in recent days.

It is said that the association has accepted this request and plans to convene a meeting of manufacturer representatives in the coming days to discuss the extension of the deadline and other ongoing matters.</p>
<h3>A Real Estate Commission Turns Bloody</h3>
<p>Dai Laosi Was Slashed</p>
<p>Chen Ziqing Denies Conspiracy</p>
<p>Dai Laosi, a Danyang native who owns a Huiming Barber Shop at No. 800 Hainin Road, has been seeking buyers for the real estate of Zhou Xiangyun, the owner of Daqing Lane on Nanjing Road, who intends to sell the property for 6.5 million yuan. He hoped to earn a large commission after the transaction was completed. It was later discovered that a certain Cantonese wanted to buy the property, and Dai, realizing that his influence was limited and that he might not be able to win the trust of both the buyer and the seller, shared the intermediary task with Chen Ziqing (also known as Chen Zhiyun), a Wuxi native residing at No. 760 Tailai Lane on Hainin Road, who is currently working as a clerk for a lawyer, to make it easier to handle. Unexpectedly, after running around from early summer to late winter, the effort failed, and the hoped-for reward also vanished. The participants were frustrated and began to quarrel. At 3 p.m. on the 21st of last month, while Dai was at Chen's house, he was suddenly attacked from behind with a sharp kitchen knife due to this dispute, and his back was slashed, causing blood to flow immediately. Dai ran wounded to the nearby Huishi Patrol Room to report the incident. The head of the patrol ordered him to take off his clothes for inspection, and it was found that his shirt was half-covered in blood. He dispatched detectives to send Dai to the hospital for treatment and went to Chen's house to inquire about the cause of the incident, but the murderer had already escaped. Dai's injuries have now healed, and he has been discharged from the hospital. He claimed that there were four people at the scene of the crime: Chen Ziqing, Li Shurong from Shandong, Yuan Bingnan from Jiangbei, and Lu Zhensheng from Huzhou. He hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against them for injury, requesting that they be interrogated and punished according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special District Court opened the trial. Only the defendant Chen Zhiyun appeared in court. The other three, Li, Yuan, and Lu, had all fled. The plaintiff, Dai Laosi, described the incident in detail, stating that the real estate transaction was a collaboration between him and Chen. Although the deal was not finalized, Chen demanded 50 yuan from him as compensation for the loss. Because he refused to pay, Chen repeatedly demanded the money. On October 1st, he even dragged him into the Hongkou Patrol Room, but he was released after the head of the patrol inquired. On December 14th, Chen sent Yuan Bingnan to summon him to a teahouse, still demanding the money. He still refused, so on the afternoon of December 21st, Chen suddenly sent Lu Zhensheng to the barbershop, falsely claiming that the real estate deal had been completed and ordering him to go to Chen's house to divide the money. Upon arrival, Chen was smoking opium in the inner room and ordered the crowd not to let him go. Yuan Bingnan tightly held his hand, and Li Shurong took Chen's kitchen knife and slashed him from behind. He ran wounded to the Huishi Patrol Room to report the incident. When the detectives arrived at Chen's house, the murderers had already fled. Li, Yuan, and Lu are all Chen's accomplices, so only Chen knows their whereabouts, but he refuses to help catch them. Chen Zhiyun claimed that Cao, the buyer, had given Dai 50 yuan during the negotiations. When he did not buy the property, Cao asked Dai to return the money. Dai repeatedly promised to return it, but repeatedly broke his promise. Cao once wanted to accuse him of fraud, but he did not succeed because he refused to testify. On the afternoon of the 21st, he was in a neighbor's house and heard them fighting in his house, so he rushed home, but it had already subsided. He did not know who the murderer was. If it was as Dai claimed, the Patrol Room would have investigated him. When Dai heard Chen's statement, he firmly denied receiving money from Cao, saying that Chen repeatedly demanded compensation for the loss, which led to the incident. Chen's wife, Shunzhu, was also questioned. Judge Liu ordered the hearing to be continued at a later date.</p>

<h3>Jinshan County Colludes to Beat Foster Daughter to Death</h3>
<p>Qiu Juanbao and Others Fled to Shanghai in Fear of Punishment</p>
<p>The Body Was Thrown into Taihu Lake and Then Floated Up</p>
<p>Qiu Juanbao, 35, a woman from Liujiazhen, 12 miles from the city in Jinshan County, owns farmland. Her husband, Wu Youren, 51, are both addicted to opium. They have one adopted daughter, named Yindi, who is now six years old. The stepmother disliked the adopted daughter's fate and often beat and abused her. However, there were no neighbors, and they lived alone in a house, with no one to interfere. As a result, Yindi was forbidden to cry even when she was beaten. A week ago, Juanbao lost hundreds of yuan in a mahjong game and blamed Yindi's fate, inflicting cruel torture. Unexpectedly, she was beaten to death. Because no one knew, Juanbao put Yindi's body in a burlap sack and instructed her relatives to throw it into Taihu Lake (the relative is Chen Delin, who has now been arrested and is highly suspected). Several days later, the corpse, along with the burlap sack, suddenly floated up and was recovered by a fishing boat. Only then was the girl's body discovered. The county was immediately notified for inspection and investigation. Only then was it known that she was the adopted daughter of Qiu Juanbao. They immediately went to arrest her, but Qiu Juanbao had fled to Shanghai with her entire family. After investigation by the Jinshan County Government, it was discovered that Qiu Juanbao and others were hiding at No. 26 Kaiming Lane, Ji畝地 in Shanghai. A document was specially prepared and sent to Shanghai by Zhang Zhenhua, a patrol officer from the Second Resident Station of the County Public Security Bureau, and Item Weishan, a bailiff, to the Lao Beimen Police Station under their jurisdiction, requesting the dispatch of police to assist in the arrest. Wei Kunquan, police officer No. 9, was dispatched to arrest Qiu Juanbao, Wu Youren, and Chen Delin and brought them to the station. After questioning by Director Shen, it was determined that the case involved assisting in the arrest of major criminals in a homicide case, and it was decided to send them to the General Bureau for investigation and disposition.</p>

<h3>Female Teacher Drowns Herself</h3>
<p>Zheng Juying, a female teacher who used to work at a certain municipal elementary school in Hangzhou, was in her twenties and from Luodian, Baoshan.

<h3>Arson and Framing Are Extremely Unlawful</h3>
<p>Guo Yuanzhong, a native of Gaoyou, leased a piece of vacant land on Limin Road in Hongkou from a landlord six years ago (the lease term was ten years). In addition to building more than ten bungalows and opening a Yunban Wood Factory, he rented out the remaining vacant land to his fellow villagers, Xia Lixi, Li Yongkui, and others, to build thatched sheds to avoid wind and rain. They had always been at peace. Recently, Guo Yuanzhong demanded 50 yuan from Xia Lixi for an old debt, but Xia bore a grudge and thought of a way to retaliate. He secretly instructed others to buy boards from the Yunji Plank Wood Factory on the pretext, and when people were unprepared, they poured kerosene on the boards. Xia and others then claimed that the plank wood factory intended to commit arson to claim insurance money. This was discovered by the police station in charge, and Guo Yuanzhong was immediately arrested and taken to the station. According to Guo's confession, he was actually framed by Xia Lixi, Li Yongkui, and others. Although his factory was insured for a thousand yuan, the planks, houses, and means of livelihood in the factory were worth no less than three or four thousand gold. He was ordered to summon Xia Lixi, Li Yongkui, and Chen Dazhaozi, Xu Taibao, Xu Baocheng, and Li Wangshi, the tenants of the thatched sheds involved, to court. Chen Dazhaozi and others testified that it was indeed Xia Lixi and Li Yongkui who conspired to frame Guo.

When the civilian came out, Zhen had already been seriously injured, with blood flowing like a fountain, unconscious and lying on the ground. Therefore, he came to report and request an arrest. After receiving the report, Director Wu immediately dispatched Police Chief Li Huapu with police to arrest the murderers Shen Zhang and Shen An'an and their daughter and the wooden stick and sent them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation yesterday morning, along with a document.

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing the Words, She Covers Her Face and Weeps as She Sells Herself, Liu Xin Seeks to Probe, Please East, Pious Hope</p>
<p>Li Shilian had seen these things with his own eyes. At this time, it would be unreasonable to keep urging Yueying to speak. But if he let her go, he would have no way to answer Jia Duocai. As he thought about this, he first stood up abruptly, then slowly sat down. But before his buttocks were firmly seated, he stood up again. Amidst his unstable state, Cheng Zhiqian understood early on and laughed: "Mr. Li seems to intend to find this girl as his concubine. You can proceed, it will not be hindered in any way because of me." Li Shilian laughed: "Mr. Cheng, do you see how we are almost having trouble even eating two meals? How can we still be happy? It is this Mr. Jia in front, I don't know how, who has taken a fancy to this girl and wants to get her." Cheng Zhiqian said lightly: "So, this girl's body already has a patron." Li Shilian said: "This Mr. Jia is my friend, a very good person. His intention is also to feel that this girl is very pitiful. Taking her would be saving her." Zhiqian said: "This gentleman is surnamed Jia, oh, Jia of Jia Baoyu, haha! No wonder he is so amorous." Li Shilian felt that such mocking words were inappropriate. One is willing to be a concubine, and one is willing to marry a concubine. Why are onlookers saying such nonsense? As he pondered in his heart, he also wanted to retaliate with a few words, but in the space of his thoughts, the waiter brought up a dinner invitation, as well as a notice written on red paper. Zhiqian took the invitation, threw it on the table first, and laughed: "Why are we invited again?" Only then did he look at the notice. Li Shilian's seat was not far from the table. The folded invitation was opened upwards. Looking intently, he saw that it was written "Respectfully Ordered by Gao Hesheng." Gao Hesheng was the director of the Construction Department, unexpectedly Cheng Zhiqian also knew him. To say that he was a semi-rich man in Xi'an was no exaggeration. He wanted to make inroads into the construction field, so this was someone he should contact. (111)</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Red Hats Worn by Street Cleaners</h3>
<p>— Lu Wu</p>
<p>In Shanghai, on every street, we can see street cleaners wearing red hats and red vests, working very carefully, sweeping up the debris on the streets and the fruit peels and scraps of paper that people unintentionally discard.</p>
<p>Why do they have to wear red hats?</p>
<p>In 1792, during the height of the French Revolution, some of King Louis XVI's loyal guards, seeing the tense revolutionary mood of the people of Paris at that time, also rebelled and secretly ran to the side of the people's revolutionary army to help with the revolutionary work.</p>
<p>However, some of the rebellious soldiers were caught by the non-rebellious guards, who sent them to places with many people to do hard labor, and made them wear red hats. Their intention was: on the one hand, to prevent them from escaping, as the red hats would really attract a lot of attention.</p>
<p>This was a form of punishment and extreme humiliation.</p>
<p>At that time, the revolutionary people of Paris, seeing that the revolutionary comrades standing on the same front as themselves were subjected to such great humiliation and pain, expressed great sympathy. However, for a moment, they couldn't think of any good way to help them get rid of this shame. Later, everyone simply wore red hats to confuse the sight of the guards, making it difficult for them to see who the arrested soldiers were. Soon, many inexplicable people also wore red hats to show off, and later, more and more people wore them. The red hat actually became a symbol of revolutionary elements.</p>
<p>However, the red hat, which was misunderstood as a symbol of the spirit of revolutionary elements, in present-day Shanghai, has returned to the original label of being punished to do hard labor! You see, now, not only street cleaners wear red hats, but also porters at train stations, workers on docks... which coolie is not wearing a red hat?</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Xinquan)</p>
<p>Ms. SS is a staunch advocate of celibacy. But there are more than a dozen men chasing her, which I find a bit strange. Later, according to someone in the know: "Although she strongly advocates celibacy, it proves that she is currently alone. It can be said that it is a countermeasure of hers, giving us a way in. When she has a partner, don't worry that she won't shout that love is sacred!"</p>
<h3>Another Biography of Mr. Li</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Mr. Li is truly a peculiar person," is what everyone who knows him says. It turns out that Mr. Li has several strange temperaments that are worth everyone considering strange. They are now written below as another biography of Mr. Li.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Li has no policy regarding the use of money. He uses money when he shouldn't and doesn't use it when he should. This is where his method of using money differs from others. However, this often leads to his financial difficulties. However, when he is in financial difficulty, he has a way to solve his difficulties, which is to "lie down and not get up," and he shouts, "I have no money, so I am resisting here for a long time."</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Li's social circle is very wide. It turns out that he considers anyone who has met him once as a lifelong confidant! And he often takes other people's cards and says to people, "This person is how and how, and my relationship with him is how close," but when people ask him to introduce them, Mr. Li always says, "I have only met him once, I'm afraid he doesn't even know me."</p>
<p>Finally, our Mr. Li is very fond of women, especially young women. He is even more welcoming because he is a doctor. When he sees young women coming to him for medical treatment, he even sacrifices fruit to entertain them. On the other hand, if men come to him for medical treatment, if he is not in a good mood, he doesn't even bother to pay attention to them. We all think this temperament is very special.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that this Mr. Li is someone who needs to have another biography written for him for publicity purposes.</p>
<h3>Oddments Shop</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>When you take expensive fabrics to a tailor to make clothes, they always have to take some material from your fabric, especially leather, which is their best customer. They'll steal a good-quality gray squirrel pelt, cut off several inches of thick fox fur, and they won't even let the ordinary sheepskin go. That's why the lining of our fur coats, after wearing them for a while, will shrink and be an inch or two shorter than the outside. The reason is that when they make them, they're thinking of skimming off your material, stretching the leather, and spraying it with water.</p>
<p>Tailors and assistants have to skim off material to sell to oddments shops, so when we're making expensive fur coats, it's best to tell them beforehand, "If you do a good job, I'll give you some extra money for wine." Otherwise, your clothes will suffer invisible losses.</p>
<p>The largest concentration of oddments shops is in Sanpailou in the city and along Shilu outside the city. In their shops, they sell silks, satins, woolens, and serge, and they also hang up gray squirrel pelts, fox furs, sheepskin cakes, fur collars, and the like. Woolens and serge are mainly sold to people for making shoe uppers or adding trim. Fur goods range from a few inches to entire robe materials and jackets. These are all made from scraps into whole pieces, regardless of the labor involved. So some so-called "old hands" only need to look around oddments shops to choose materials for making fur robes, where the quality is good and the prices are cheap.</p>
<p>Winter is the time when tailors' assistants sell the most goods. Every fifth and tenth day of the month are their so-called "off days" when they stop working at night. Crowds throng in front of the brightly lit oddments shops, noisily trading their goods.</p>
<p>Although tailors' assistants are skilled at skimming off other people's materials, the money vanishes as soon as they get it. They either get into a game of "five hundred spades" or go to gambling dens, or even "hunt wild chickens."</p>
<h3>Written to See My Cousin Kunyi Return to Her Teacher Gao Qifeng's Grave</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>A few glimmers of warmth in the depths of a frozen winter,</p>
<p>Her lonely shadow sorrowfully ascends a ten-thousand-mile journey.</p>
<p>Even the sound of ants in their nests can pierce the heavens,</p>
<p>And the sea will dry before the pearls of the shark turn to blood.</p>
<p>Sincerity and devotion will manifest as golden characters,</p>
<p>Her remaining efforts should become a burial mound.</p>
<p>May the weeds in the underworld find some solace,</p>
<p>A single star at dawn is not entirely alone.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3>Fragments of the Sound of Jade</h3>
<p>— Wang Fang'an</p>
<p>Cheng is the precious daughter of my friend Cao Mengyu, whose style name is Qingyang. Her given name is Aqi, and she is only ten years old. From birth, she has shown a face of extraordinary intelligence. She remembers everything she reads, and her writing is also quite beautiful. She speaks Western languages fluently. She is currently studying in the fifth grade at Minzhi Elementary School on Weihaiwei Road, where her cleverness surpasses her peers. But unfortunately, on the evening of the fifteenth of the month, she suffered a terrible accident! That evening, Mengyu was carelessly cleaning a gun, and a bullet went astray. Cheng happened to be nearby and was accidentally hit. She died despite medical treatment! A rare talent in the world, like a flash of ephemeral beauty. The tragic news spread, and everyone mourned her loss. My friendship with Mengyu began ten years ago. We did not know each other at first. Later, Mengyu became the editor of the Luotuo Pictorial and moved his family to Shanghai. He brought his wife, Wan, and Cheng, and they lived together on Tongfu Road. I happened to come to Shanghai and made a special visit. At that time, Cheng was only five years old, like a little bird nestled in Wan's arms. She would smile shyly at strangers, but her bright, clear eyes would often stare at me intently. I loved her and stroked her forehead, and she immediately called out "Uncle." I couldn't help but marvel at her quickness. While I was talking with Mengyu, I also heard her sing in a melodious voice, "The Grape Fairy," her tone clear and her words distinct, while she danced and sang. Mengyu and his wife were overjoyed. I often called her a little angel, and in my heart, I deeply admired Mengyu and his wife for their dual blessings of happiness and wisdom; to have such a lovely child to bring them joy. I heard Mengyu say that Cheng had already learned over a thousand characters, all taught by Wan. In the style of Ouyang Xiu and Mengmu, I couldn't help but congratulate Mengyu on having such a virtuous helper. Three years later, I rented a house by the lake. When the osmanthus flowers were fragrant, Mengyu, Wan, and Cheng arrived unannounced to see the Qiantang Tidal Bore. We agreed to be their guide. We traveled for two days, visiting all the scenic spots by the lake. Cheng was already eight years old and dressed like a young girl with her hair hanging down. I asked her how many characters she knew, and it was many more than before. When we were leisurely riding in a small boat in the middle of the lake, Cheng would often say things that made people laugh heartily. It seemed that she had a predestined connection with my wife and me and our deceased son, Tie Ru. She would always interrupt when my wife and I were telling stories about the lake and make Tie Ru laugh with joy, calling him "little brother" in a sweet voice, and even giving him several of her favorite toys. On the day of our departure, Cheng insisted on inviting us to Shanghai during the New Year holiday for a happy gathering, making us reluctant to leave. Her sense of propriety was amazing. That winter, I suffered the loss of Tie Ru and was in a terrible mood. I returned to my hometown to recuperate and stayed at home, and I gradually lost contact with Mengyu. However, every time I woke up from a dream with my wife, after mourning Tie Ru, I couldn't help but think of Cheng. I have been living in seclusion ever since, feeling quite bored. At the beginning of last month, I was invited by Mengyu to come to Shanghai to help him with some matters to relieve my boredom. So I spent time with Cheng day and night, observing her diligence in her studies. I suspected that she was not like other girls of ten years old. Recently, Wan has been busy managing the household and has been slightly less attentive to teaching Cheng, but Cheng's eagerness to ask questions and delve deeper before the lamp is the same as before. Since I came here, she has turned to me to seek deeper knowledge and has insisted that I tutor her in Western languages. I realized that I have neglected this skill for fifteen years and that I can only understand the writing and pronunciation. I couldn't refuse her request, and I was truly ashamed. A month later, I returned to my hometown, and before leaving, I made an agreement to come back and tutor her every Sunday. Although I was reluctant to be a teacher, Cheng was so earnest and repeatedly urged me to come back soon and help her prepare her writing materials. She held onto my clothes, reluctant to let me go, just like a family member. Who would have thought that our final farewell would be in those moments? After returning to my hometown, I often talked to my wife about Cheng's love of learning, deeply regretting that our two daughters were used to being lazy. My wife also often thought about Cheng's cleverness and loveliness, so she asked me to prepare some fruit to take to Cheng as a gift. On the sixteenth, I returned to Shanghai, and after removing the dust of travel, I happened to flip through the newspaper and saw the shocking news of Cheng's death. After recovering from the initial shock, I quickly drove to Mengyu's house. When I arrived, I found that the news was indeed true. Alas! Mengyu, upon seeing me, burst into tears. Wan was sobbing and unable to speak. I was also overcome with grief and could find no words to comfort them. After a long while, I heard Mengyu say, "I have always been careful with my gun, and I never dared to load it with bullets. Recently, because it has been cold and late when I return home, I was afraid of encountering bandits, so I kept it by my side. That night, when I returned home, as usual, I immediately took out the bullets, but I don't know how a bullet ended up remaining in the barrel, causing this tragedy. Afterwards, I decided to comply with the law and reported it to the authorities. At this moment, my heart is aching and filled with remorse. I don't know how to console Aqi in the afterlife." I heard that on the day of Cheng's encoffining, her face looked lifelike, and her smile was sweet. There was no trace of blood from the wound. Could it be that Cheng had completed her time in the human world and returned to her celestial island? I have heard of examples of spiritual liberation and sword dissolution, which might be similar to this. Mengyu is a person of great emotion. This time, he suffered this tragedy and accidentally destroyed his precious daughter. At this moment, I cannot help but offer some absurd words of consolation, hoping to alleviate his sorrow. Mengyu also told me that Cheng has always been loved by friends, and everyone in the literary community has praised her intelligence. In recent days, Mr. Shou Juan, Mu Qin, Kong Wo, Li Qin, and other gentlemen have sent their condolences, and he is deeply grateful for their kindness. They are also planning to collect Cheng's remaining works from school, attach a eulogy, and publish "Records of Withered Ephemerals" to commemorate her.</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense: A Fleeting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At this point, to make us more convinced that what she was saying was not fabricated in any way, the Empress Dowager randomly pointed out several real-life pieces of ironclad evidence. These were many weapons hanging in a large cabinet. The cabinet had no doors, and its position was very sunny, so we could see everything very clearly from the outside. The swords and arrows were mostly rusty, and the bowstrings were rotten, but on each item, there were very noticeable inscriptions, such as: "So-and-so (the name of the leader) used this sword to personally kill a tiger on such-and-such day of such-and-such month in such-and-such year," or "So-and-so used this bow and arrow to hunt a leopard on such-and-such day of such-and-such month in such-and-such year." However, they were all in Manchu, which we naturally couldn't understand. Fortunately, there was a female official who was well-versed in this language to translate for us, so we were able to fully understand. The Empress Dowager also paid close attention to the sentences that the translator produced and had a kind of triumphant expression. Originally, she had only casually guessed that the reason these weapons were so carefully collected was nothing more than to extol the military prowess of her ancestors, so she quickly pointed them out to us. However, she did not expect that her guess was completely correct, so she was naturally very pleased!</p>
<p>In the room on the left, I also discovered something very strange: these were two iron rings that were already very rusty and difficult to look at. The diameter of the rings was probably larger than the wrists of the fattest people. These two rings were hung from the roof beams by two ropes that were not connected, hanging at the same height as the shoulders of a person of average height. The two ropes must have originally been very thick and strong, but now they were moldy and rotten, as if they could be broken immediately with a gentle pull. (221)</p>

<h3>Implementing a Radical and Gradual Approach to Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>The proposal by Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei and others has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be implemented by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>The proposal by Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei and eight others to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to implement a radical and gradual approach to compulsory education, which was approved by the plenary session and decided by the Central Political Council to be implemented by the National Government, has been instructed by the National Government to the Executive Yuan, which in turn has ordered the Ministry of Education to comply. The original proposal by Committee member Cai and others is as follows:</p>
<h3>Proposal for Implementing a Radical and Gradual Approach to Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>It is essential to implement compulsory education in our country today. The party's program has a provision for vigorously promoting national education, and the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage also has a provision that all children of school age should receive compulsory education. Most of our people have not received even the most basic education, and compulsory education is essential for implementing national policies, social construction, and overcoming obstacles to the revival of the nation. The old four-year compulsory education system has been vigorously promoted by the central and local education authorities, but due to a lack of funds, a shortage of teachers, and other reasons, the results have been limited. Even today, illiteracy is common in large cities, and even more so in remote rural areas. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the number of children enrolled in school only accounted for 21.08% of school-age children. At a time when the world situation is pressing, if we do not adopt more effective methods to promote compulsory education in the shortest possible time, the future of the nation is truly worrying. The Ministry of Education has previously formulated primary school regulations, which went through the legislative process and were promulgated by the National Government in December of the 21st year of the Republic (1932). In addition, there are the General Outline for the First Phase of Compulsory Education and the General Outline for the Implementation of Short-Term Compulsory Education, which were promulgated by the ministry in June of the 21st year of the Republic, and four volumes of short-term primary school textbooks have been compiled and distributed for use. In addition, there is a general order for primary schools to adopt the two-shift system. However, because there is no mandatory law to require provinces and cities to comply, the strictness and speed of implementation vary greatly. The above-mentioned methods are summarized below, and suggestions are put forward as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Short-term compulsory education with a one-year time limit should be implemented to enforce education for out-of-school children aged ten to sixteen. This is a radical approach.</p>
<p>In the 9th year of the Republic (1920), there were laws and regulations for compulsory education, with a promotion period of one year. After the establishment of the National Government, the Second National Education Conference changed the promotion period of compulsory education to 20 years. However, the targets of promotion are all four years. The cost of compulsory education is huge, and the number of teachers required is large. Judging from the national financial resources, social economy, and the actual situation of existing teachers, the gap is far too great. To achieve the goal of universal education, the day of achieving it seems to be indefinitely postponed. The previously promulgated Measures for Short-term Compulsory Education were concluded as an emergency policy to adapt to the special environment of our country. The duration of compulsory education is temporarily shortened to a short-term one year. Primary schools or short-term primary school classes allow out-of-school children aged ten to sixteen to receive two hours of education in shifts every day, and tuition fees are waived and books and supplies are provided so that poor children can work while attending school for free. Over the past 20 years, the central and local authorities have promoted and implemented compulsory education, which cannot be said to be ineffective. However, the reason why it takes a long time, a lot of effort, and little effect is that the funds and teachers required for four years of compulsory education are also too large. Short-term primary schools or short-term primary school classes employ a teacher in the morning, afternoon, and evening to teach three classes of out-of-school children. Counting 40 children per class, 120 children can graduate in one year. Compared with ordinary primary school children in two classes, 40 children per class, graduating in four years, only 80 children, the disparity in the amount of funding is 1 to 18. The curriculum of short-term primary schools or short-term primary school classes is only literacy, simple common sense, and simple arithmetic, which is very easy to teach, but slightly more advanced than the current civilian schools. Anyone who knows how to read and write can take the job. Therefore, its teachers are not limited to those who have received teacher training and have any teaching experience. The situation is different from ordinary middle school courses with many teachers, who must be strictly tested. The previous General Outline for the Implementation of Measures stipulated that in addition to hiring qualified teachers, the following personnel should be fully utilized: (1) teacher-training students from local normal schools or rural normal schools who are about to complete their internship; (2) teachers who have received considerable training and can be used as substitute teachers; (3) local civil servants; (4) local people with considerable education; (5) volunteers who are willing to serve as teachers and fulfill their obligations. The teacher qualifications are specially relaxed. This is a common fact when countries begin to implement compulsory education. Furthermore, older students have stronger learning abilities, and the effect of one year may be almost the same as that of a six-year-old entering school and receiving four years of education. And older people can go out and serve as soon as they graduate. In terms of the entire society, it is equivalent to increasing a large number of literate young people every year. All countries implement compulsory education, starting with the promotion of primary school education, making primary school education compulsory, and gradually extending the length of compulsory education. There are too many illiterates in our country, and the financial resources are too tight. Compulsory education and primary school education cannot be combined into one thing. For older out-of-school children, shortening the length of compulsory education in order to achieve rapid popularization is a last resort. Based on the above reasons, it is proposed that the central government stipulate that the 24th year of the Republic (1935) shall be the starting period for the implementation of compulsory education, temporarily with a period of four years, and designate short-term primary schools or short-term primary school classes as places for the implementation of compulsory education, and implement compulsory education for older out-of-school children aged ten to sixteen.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to vigorously promoting primary school education and earnestly implement the half-day two-shift system. This is a fundamental approach.</p>
<p>The aforementioned short-term compulsory education is specially designed for saving older out-of-school children. In order to increase the enrollment opportunities for school-age children and improve the efficiency of ordinary primary school education, it is essential to promote and enrich primary school education. The previously established Primary School Law and Primary School Regulations have strict regulations on local education research, primary school staffing, financial allocation, equipment enrichment, moral education reform, and teacher treatment. Special attention is paid to the curriculum in order to enable existing primary schools to comply with these regulations and enrich their content. In the General Outline for the First Phase of Compulsory Education, the procedures for phased and regional implementation are specified in order to gradually achieve universal coverage. However, phased and regional implementation requires years of teacher training. Although simplified normal schools, simplified normal departments, and vocational normal departments have been added in addition to ordinary normal schools, this is still too slow to respond to emergencies, and it is impossible to train a large number of talents in a short period of time. Therefore, another emergency method must be considered. What is this method? It is the adoption of the two-shift system. According to the statistics of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), there were 250,840 primary schools and kindergartens in the country, 568,484 primary school teachers, and 10,994,8979 children in school. On average, each school only has 44 children, and each teacher only teaches 19 children. Such uneconomical practices are rare in the world. Countries with developed education and economies far superior to ours have more children taught by each teacher than we do. It is unreasonable for our country's poverty to reverse this waste. The danger to the future of the country is also unimaginable. The two-shift system is an excellent way to expand and develop primary school education without increasing the existing amount of funding and teachers. After the European War, some countries have adopted it one after another and achieved significant results. The half-day two-shift system is particularly suitable for the current economic principles of our country, as there is no need to add school buildings and games and rest places. In terms of the benefits for children, the two-shift system is slightly inferior to ordinary primary schools, but the difference is not too great. Furthermore, for the sake of the entire society, it is reasonable to slightly reduce the educational happiness of a few school-age children for the sake of the majority of out-of-school children in order to fulfill the duty of mutual assistance. After the two-shift system is implemented, the expenses and teachers of each primary school only need to be slightly increased, and the number of children can be doubled. In other words, one school can be used as two schools, and the number of primary schools in the country will double immediately. At the same time, the existing primary schools will be utilized to the maximum extent and the enrollment will be increased, so that the number of children entering school can be increased several times, and gradually it will be universalized to all school-age children. Based on the above reasons, it is proposed that the central government actively promote the nationwide primary schools to earnestly implement the half-day two-shift system by order of the National Government. The places where primary schools in villages and cities cannot meet the demand should strive to follow the above. At the same time, the teachers of private schools should be trained to make up for the deficiencies of the above-mentioned teacher training.</p>
<p>As for the source of funding for the above-mentioned compulsory education, there are detailed regulations in the Implementation Measures. The main points are that in addition to raising funds locally, the competent education administrative agencies should be requested to provide subsidies. However, the number of local funds that are insufficient after compulsory education is implemented will be even greater. It is proposed that the central government, starting from the 24th year of the Republic (1935), designate special funds to provide subsidies, and order each province and city, starting from the 24th year of the Republic (1935), to allocate special funds for the implementation of short-term compulsory education and the promotion of the primary school two-shift system. (Check the resolutions on education of the third plenary session of the fourth Central Executive Committee on December 21 of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), (A) Regarding national education, items 2 and 3 have regulations on this matter and are combined with a statement.) Whether the above-mentioned measures for compulsory education are appropriate is respectfully awaiting public decision.

He officially handed over the position yesterday, and Xu Xinliu was publicly elected to succeed him. An inventory was taken on the spot. It was reported that Mr. Song had been in charge of the society's fund for six and a half years.

<h3>The Liangjiang Basketball Team Defeats Yiling</h3>
<p>Traveling to Qingpu for a Match This Morning</p>
<p>Last night, Liangjiang played against Yiling at the Navy YMCA, starting at 8:30 PM. Since Liangjiang adopted the men's rules, they have won big victories in the first match against the American Union and the second match against the Anglo-American mixed team. The victory against the West Women's Yiling last night was also expected. In the first quarter, Liangjiang was defeated. Liangjiang seemed to be not very energetic. Within five minutes, Chen Rongming scored the first point. At this time, the competition between the two sides was quite fierce. Yiling relied on its height and strength to gain a lot of advantages. The scorekeeper called and wrote Yiling 6 and Liangjiang 3 on the blackboard. The second quarter was evenly matched. After a short break, the war started again. Liangjiang used a five-person defense, and the Yiling team was not as rampant as before. Chen Rongming and Chen Jucai of the Liangjiang team were heroic and vigorous, and the two guards also did their best, snatching and seizing the ball, and putting the enemy to death. In the third and fourth quarters, the Yiling team gradually showed signs of being unable to support themselves, and made no achievements in the fourth quarter. The Liangjiang team, which had lost first, seemed like a sea dragon at this time, agile and lively, and defended and attacked properly, which made Yiling at a loss. As a result, Liangjiang won 25 to 14. The Liangjiang A team is scheduled to go to Qingpu for a match at 9:00 AM this morning. The group of fourteen people is led by Zhang Yuansheng, the dean of academic affairs of the school, and Coach Hu Zhengqu. It is also heard that the Qingpu Chamber of Commerce Sports Association specially invited Qian Jiaxiang, the county magistrate of the county, and Huang Peize, the standing committee member of the county party department, to perform the opening kickoff ceremony, it was said. The match schedule is recorded as follows: (1) Against the Qingpu Chamber of Commerce Red Team at 3:00 PM on the 14th, (2) Against the Qingpu Chamber of Commerce Green Team at 3:00 PM on the 15th, (3) Visit Sheshan Mountain on the morning of the 16th and return to Shanghai in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no definite guarantee, and neither principal nor interest has been paid as scheduled. The standard currency is Guangdong silver coins, with each yuan roughly equivalent to 80 cents in national currency.</p>
<p>(Explanation of Table 3): (1) The outstanding principal per 100 yuan face value, or the number of unredeemed bonds per 100 consecutive bonds. (2) The total amount is 15 million yuan. Furthermore, the lottery for these public bonds uses the last digit as the standard, so there are only ten numbers. (3) The total amount is 300,000 yuan. 93,366 yuan were issued in December 1928, and additional funds were raised starting in January 1930, with another 12,831 yuan issued. (4) Originally calculated at 1% per annum, interest was waived after reorganization. Also, this amount was originally drawn along with the provincial construction public bonds. Whether there have been any changes since then remains to be verified. (5) The total amount is 2 million yuan. (6) The total amount is 1 million yuan. (7) There are only seventy numbers for this public bond. Also, since the issuance of the provincial water conservancy construction public bonds, it has been decided to redeem these construction bonds, and registration is currently being carried out. (8) This amount was jointly issued with Zhejiang Province. (9) The interest rate is 1% per annum for the first year, and then increases by 1.5% each year until it reaches 1.75% in the sixth year. (10) The total amount is 3 million yuan. (11) Issued in three installments: 1.5 million yuan was issued for the first time in 1930, and another 500,000 yuan was issued in each of 1932 and 1934. (12) Principal and interest have not been paid since the second lottery. One theory is that the actual amount issued was only 2 million yuan. (13) The central government's appropriation failed to remit the full amount to Fujian, and it has not been fully repaid. The current outstanding amount is unknown. (14) The actual amount raised is unknown. It is only known that another 400,000 yuan was issued in 1933. (15) The fundraising failed to reach the full amount. In May 1931, the provincial finance department issued an order to stop fundraising. (16) The total amount is 3 million yuan. (17) The total amount is 1.2 million yuan. (18) Although this bond was ordered to be raised by the central government, it has all been diverted to provincial expenses and has not been remitted to the ministry, nor has an application for issuance been made. The fundraising amount was 1,208,100 yuan. (19) The total amount is 1 million yuan. (20) Raised during Sun Chuanfang's era. (21) Raised during Zhou Yinren's era. (22) The total amount is 10 million silver yuan. (23) The total amount is 30 million silver yuan. One theory is that the actual amount raised was only slightly more than 5 million yuan. (24) In December 1916, the Beijing government approved the allocation of 1 million yuan, which was raised in Guangdong and retained for post-disaster relief purposes. The principal and interest payable should still be raised and remitted for unified handling. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Financial Weekly Call Loan Rate Drops Another Two Cents</h3>
<p>The silver market has been gradually declining recently, and yesterday was Sunday, with banks closed, making the situation even more sluggish. As a result, the call loan rate continued to weaken, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 21 cents, a further drop of two cents from the previous day. Call loan transactions: over 1.5 million in the morning market, over 600,000 in new transactions, over 400,000 in the afternoon market, over 700,000 in the Small General Association, over 300,000 in silver pawn redemptions, over 500,000 in new loans, over 200,000 in banknote redemptions, over 27 million in bank drafts from money shops, and over 300,000 in remittances from various routes. Due to the bank holiday, all collection activities were suspended. The auxiliary coin market is also softening daily. Jiangnan small silver once fell below one yuan in the morning market, to 846 yuan. Although it returned to 847 yuan in the afternoon market, there was still no change compared to the previous day. Guangdong small silver also fell by one yuan in the morning market, opening at 758.5 yuan, and changing to 758.4 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in a slight decrease of one yuan and one dime compared to the previous day. Transactions: 3,000 jiao of Jiangnan coins and 120,000 jiao of Guangdong coins in the morning market, 4,000 jiao of Jiangnan coins and 90,000 jiao of Guangdong coins in the afternoon market. Copper coins also decreased by 1,000 wen compared to the previous day, to 306,000 wen, with a transaction volume of 29,988 strings of wen, equivalent to 9,800 yuan.</p>

<h3>Theoretical Points on Taxation of Securities and Securities Broker Transactions</h3>
<p>Debt Transfer…Why Charge Fees?</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the entire body of brokers at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange held a general meeting on the eighth floor of the Securities Building to discuss the government's recent preparation to levy transaction taxes. The number of attendees was extremely enthusiastic. First, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Brokers Association announced the progress and their work. There were many speeches at the meeting. Everyone believed that the government has issued public bonds and treasury bills for many years, with the amount already around 100 million yuan. They rely on the brokers to widely promote and sell them, which has resulted in an astonishing achievement. Brokers have made an essential contribution. The obligation to pay taxes is not something brokers object to. However, public bonds and treasury bills are government-issued debt instruments. No country in the world levies transaction taxes on them. Even when the government issues documents and contracts for official business, there is never a stamp tax. This shows that public bonds cannot be compared to goods such as yarn, flour, and miscellaneous grains. It is also like borrowing money in the private sector. If the debtor wants to charge the creditor a fee when the debt is transferred, it is unreasonable. As a result, everyone unanimously opposed the tax and jointly elected the chairman of the association to actively request the government to exempt or postpone the tax with the chairman of the exchange.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Raw Cotton Both Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened lower because of poor news from Liverpool. Foreign merchants sold, and each month fell by one to four pounds. Occasionally, there was no movement. Later, Wall Street was sluggish, and sentiment softened further. At the close, there was some short covering, which slightly strengthened the market. Spot prices fell by 9 points, and futures prices fell by 7-8 points. Indian cotton fell due to selling by Japanese merchants and hedging by cotton farmers. Pingguo'er fell by 3.25 Robbie, Aomura fell by 6 Robbie, and Bairoxi fell by 5.75 Robbie. Original telegraph on the left (12th telegram).</p>

<h3>General Situation of Medical and Health in Nanning City</h3>
<p>— Zhichang</p>
<p>Nanning is the political center of Guangxi. In recent years, the opening of roads and the expansion of urban areas have been completed in order. Therefore, it is more prosperous and lively than in the past, the population has doubled, and the sanitary facilities are slightly more complete than in the past. However, the medical and pharmaceutical equipment has not developed much. Now, I will briefly describe the current situation of medical and health in the city as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Public Health Facilities</p>
<p>Public health is fully handled by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. Its facilities can be divided into the following items: (1) Cleaning - Regarding cleaning, garbage dumping grounds are set up in remote areas. If the streets and alleys are far away from the garbage dump, public garbage bins are hung. The Public Security Bureau manufactures garbage trucks, and orders the servants to push them to the streets and alleys with garbage bins every day at a scheduled time and frequency to dump the garbage in the bins. They also stop at a place for a certain period of time, ringing the bell as a sign, so that all the garbage of the residents in the street can be dumped into the garbage truck. In addition, sanitation workers are hired to sweep the streets twice a day, and the Public Security Bureau issues an order to the whole city to carry out a major cleaning twice a year, disinfecting the city's ditches, public toilets, public urinals, public spittoons, etc. with medicinal water. (2) Health Care - Regarding health care, the sale of all unsanitary food and beverages is prohibited, illegal doctors and midwives are banned, sick animals are prohibited from being slaughtered, inspection teams are organized to inspect the sanitary facilities of public toilets, kitchens and toilets of each household, theaters, and restaurants in the city. (3) Epidemic Prevention - Regarding epidemic prevention, cowpox is vaccinated free of charge every year. Hospitals and doctors in the city are hired as voluntary positions. Every summer, hospitals and doctors in the city are convened to form an epidemic prevention committee to administer various epidemic prevention vaccines to citizens free of charge, carry out fly eradication campaigns, and set up rat boxes in various streets. The above is about the implementation of public health. As for publicity, leaflets or pictorials with texts such as various disease prevention methods and key points of personal hygiene are printed and distributed. This is a general overview of public health.</p>
<p>(2) Current Situation of Hospitals</p>
<p>There are a total of five hospitals and one Red Cross Society in Nanning City. The Red Cross Society has no facilities for hospitalization and only does emergency work. Among the five hospitals, one is a public military hospital, three are established by churches, and one is private. The best equipped and largest in scale is the military hospital, which has fourteen new doctors. It has solar lamps, X-rays, electrotherapy and other equipment. However, only soldiers and students receiving military training are allowed to be hospitalized. Those who are hospitalized do not have to pay any fees, only a meal fee of 30 cents per day. Officers and soldiers are treated equally. Surgical fees, injection fees, and oral medicine fees are all waived. Although ordinary people are not allowed to be hospitalized, they are allowed to enter the hospital for diagnosis and treatment at a certain time every day. All kinds of fees are charged, but they are slightly cheaper than other hospitals. Among the three hospitals established by the church, one has one new doctor, one has three new doctors, and one has two new doctors. The equipment is not very complete, and they are all ordinary equipment. There are no X-rays. The minimum hospitalization fee is two yuan per day, and the minimum injection fee is five yuan per injection. The surgical fee is determined according to the severity of the illness. If you do not stay in the hospital and go to the hospital for consultation, the consultation fee is one yuan each time, and the medicine fee and injection fee are given according to the price set by the hospital. The above four hospitals have a certain time every day to provide free diagnosis and treatment to benefit the poor and sick. One of the private hospitals has one Chinese medicine doctor and no equipment, and the cost is not detailed.</p>
<p>The current situation of the five hospitals is listed below:</p>
<p>Name Doctor Establishment Annual Public Funding</p>
<p>Guangxi Military Hospital 14 (Western) Public 110,000 yuan</p>
<p>Rose Hospital 3 (Western) Church</p>
<p>Daojiu Hospital 1 (Western) Church 18,690 yuan</p>
<p>Paradise Hospital 2 (Western) Church</p>
<p>Puji Hospital 1 (Chinese) Private</p>
<p>(3) Current Situation of Private Clinics and Pharmacies</p>
<p>There are a total of 129 old doctors and 38 new doctors in Nanning City. Comparing the medical skills of the two, the old doctors are better. This is of course in general terms. If they are famous doctors, their medical skills will be very prosperous. The reasons for this phenomenon can be divided into several points: (1) The cost of old doctors is cheaper, and the price of medicine is not expensive. If they are new doctors, they have spent a lot of money and financial resources when they were studying medicine. When they graduate and practice medicine, the equipment of medical instruments also costs a lot, so the remuneration they take is naturally higher. In addition, the medicine comes from overseas, and the tax is very heavy when it is transported to the interior, so the price of medicine is also expensive. The old doctors do not need any equipment, and their medical skills are mostly inherited from their ancestors, so they do not need to spend much money, so the price they take is also cheaper. Usually, the consultation fee for old doctors is only a few cents per visit, while the consultation fee for new doctors is one yuan. If the disease needs to be injected, the cost is even greater. Therefore, ordinary people seek help from old doctors in order to reduce the burden. (2) New doctors without medical ethics cheat and make people lose faith in new doctors - Some new doctors without medical ethics take advantage of the fact that ordinary people do not know the cost of new medicines and do not know what medicine to use for what disease. Therefore, when treating a patient, they want to prevent the patient from recovering quickly in order to get more money. They often give unimportant medicines to take internally, or inject distilled water and say that they are injecting a certain medicine, which costs a certain amount. This makes the patient spend a lot of money, and the pain cannot be relieved. Therefore, they turn to old doctors and get better. The patient immediately publicizes that new doctors are useless. There are few such doctors, but they are indeed moths in the new medical community. (3) Because the equipment of private clinics is simpler than that of hospitals, people who are sick and want to seek help from new doctors see that the equipment of private clinics is incomplete and go to hospitals more often. This is also the reason why private clinics are unpopular.</p>
<p>Now let's briefly talk about pharmacies. There are 59 Chinese pharmacies and 16 Western pharmacies in Nanning. The business of pharmacies depends on the prosperity of doctors' clinics, but there are many over-the-counter drugs in Western pharmacies. People with sufficient economic means see that their methods of taking are convenient, and they do not need to consult a doctor, so many people buy them.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) - Mr. Zhichang put forward three reasons why new medicine in Nanning is not developed: (1) Medical expenses are too expensive, (2) Affected by unethical new doctors: (3) Incomplete equipment. Among these three points, except for the second point that new doctors need to work hard on their own, the other two points are related to the economy. We hope that the new medical community will unite and that the government will do its best to help and support this budding of new medicine.</p>

<h3>One Year of Chinese Medicine and Hygiene (2)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>Introduction - Medical Education - Medical Group Activities - Medical Disputes - Medical Publishing - Medical Inspections - Medical Construction - Military Medical Training - A Glimpse of the Old Medical Field - Trends in the New Pharmaceutical Industry - Rural Hygiene Survey - Urban Hygiene Perspectives - Conclusion</p>
<p>(III) Medical Group Activities</p>
<p>Medical group activities have indeed entered a period of significant transformation in the 23rd year. Please elaborate:</p>
<p>In the spring of the 23rd year, the Third National Physicians' Association was held in the capital, bringing together elites from the north and south, and renowned scholars from the east and west. It also received support and assistance from virtuous individuals in the government, garnering praise from public opinion and attention from society. It showed signs of vigorous development in scientific medicine, like a bud about to burst into bloom. When we occasionally trace historical precedents, we realize that Japanese scientific medicine advanced rapidly after the Meiji Restoration due to the driving force of political and legal power. The slow progress of Chinese scientific medicine is because of the lack of political support. Therefore, politics serves as a major driving force in the development of medicine. Now, in the Third National Physicians' Association, renowned figures of the Party and the nation were aware of the importance of this meeting and deeply understood the relationship between medicine and the nation. They made efforts to promote it amidst the high tide of national rejuvenation, predicting that Chinese scientific medicine will have considerable progress due to this meeting.</p>
<p>Even more gratifying is that the Chinese Medical Association and the Ninth Far Eastern Tropical Medicine Association were held in Beijing one after another in the past year. The specialized research achievements presented were voluminous, mostly crystallizations of the hard work of Chinese scholars, washing away the shame of China's lack of medical research talent in the international arena! With the convening of this meeting, the future of Chinese medicine is bright, with a</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>active and ever-changing atmosphere. However, upon further investigation, there is still something that deserves our serious reflection: many Chinese scholars who made special contributions in this conference were mostly conducting research while working under foreign institutions. For example, Mr. Lin Zongyang, Yu He, Tao Chison, Yang Shuzu, Gu Jingqian and others were either at the Radium Institute in Shanghai, the Peking Union Medical College, or the Natural Science Institute in Shanghai, essentially working for others. This is something we deeply regret. China is an independent country. How can we not have our own medical research institutions to serve as places for nurturing talent and conducting research? We hope that our colleagues in the field and government authorities will actively plan and establish them to strive for supreme glory in the international medical community in the future.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China, through the efforts of Mr. Yu Yunxiu, Chen Fangzhi, Wang Qizhang, Guo Qiyuan, and Chen Zhuoren, has also made astonishing progress in the past year. The documents published in each issue of the New Medicine and Pharmaceuticals journal hosted by the association fully demonstrate the symbol of extreme progress.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that we must mention with heartfelt emotion: the signs of disintegration within the Chinese scientific medical community in the 23rd year have yet to be completely eliminated. During this period, Messrs. Song Guobin, Pang Jingzhou, Wang Qizhang, and Chen Fangzhi engaged in written discussions. Until now, the call to eliminate medical factions and achieve medical group cooperation has not yet been realized! We do not know when there will be hope for reviving the banner of "cooperation."</p>
<p>(IV) Medical Disputes</p>
<p>The 23rd year can be described as the year of medical disputes. The number of medical disputes in this year far exceeded our expectations. The most prominent cases, such as those involving Yu Songyun, Qiu Boxun, Shen Kefei, Zhang Xiangwen, Ge Chenghui, Lin Huizhen, Li Yuanshan, and Gu Zongwen, can be said to have caused a national sensation. Fortunately, legal principles were not abandoned, and academic principles were not extinguished, so they were all able to overturn wrongful convictions and avoid being framed. However, there are still people who have fallen into the legal net due to medical disputes, such as Liu Maochun, the director of the dermatology department of the Jiangxi Provincial Hospital, and his assistant, who were sentenced to imprisonment. This trend is rampant, and every doctor is in danger.</p>
<p>From a medical standpoint, it is difficult for us to assess the rights and wrongs, fearing that we might be biased. Some believe that there are absolutely no doctors who are useless and misdiagnose patients. However, examining the causes of past disputes, the doctors who were accused were not at genuine fault. Most disputes were due to financial issues, instigation by petty people, emotional misunderstandings, blame shifting among colleagues, and even attempts to obtain compensation without regard for the doctor's reputation. Such a perverse atmosphere cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The purpose of medicine is to maintain human health and achieve natural death. However, although today's level of medicine has everything, the deterioration of disease mechanisms can still lurk and erupt at any time. As such, how can those who practice medicine absolutely guarantee that patients will not die? If simply failing to restore a patient's health after diagnosis and treatment constitutes grounds for suspicion of professional negligence, then the number of such cases will be as numerous as the sands of the Ganges! The future is long, so how should we eliminate such unexpected disputes? It is necessary to make a decision urgently.</p>
<p>First - The power of medical administration should be brought into play: strictly crack down on itinerant doctors - doctors without formal medical school backgrounds, doctors who have not been reviewed and registered by the Department of Health - to raise the status of doctors and firmly demonstrate the faith of the public. Second - Medical lawsuits should be adjudicated impartially: the medical and legal professions should quickly organize a "Public Adjudication Office" for medical lawsuits. All formal doctors who are accused should first be subject to public adjudication by the Public Adjudication Office, and then be subject to legal sanctions after the adjudication determines the truth. Third - Implement a medical jury system! If there are medical lawsuit cases, the court should send a letter to the academic society to select renowned medical experts to attend court as jurors so that judges can have convenient access to consultations. Fourth - Forensic medical appraisals should be requested: the Zhenru Forensic Medicine Research Institute has achieved many successes in non-medical litigation cases it has handled over the past year. In the future, medical litigation cases should be submitted for forensic medical appraisal within a relevant scope. Fifth - Severe punishment should be given to those who fabricate accusations so that litigious individuals do not dare to easily test the law. The above are the general outlines of my humble opinion. I deeply hope that honest colleagues in the field, enlightened citizens, impartial officials, and patients of integrity will pay attention to and study them.</p>
<p>(V) Medical Publishing</p>
<p>The development of medical publishing and the excellence of printing technology are two parallel lines that develop in the same direction. In European and American countries, as well as neighboring Japan, the development of medical publishing is due to the diligent research of a group of scholars, but the excellence of printing technology is the biggest reason for promoting the development of medical publishing. This is because realistic color illustrations and radiopaque images in medicine are difficult to make satisfactory without good printing. In China's medical publishing industry: there are few research talents and no excellent printing, so progress in the past year has been extremely slow. In terms of medical books, the ones published in the 23rd year include the Internal Medicine translated by Wu Xiangfeng and others, published by the Japanese Dojinkai, and the Physiology co-translated by Zhou Songsheng and others. The Synopsis of Surgery translated by Liu Zhaolin, published by the Beiping Medical Journal, and the Internal Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment Medical Dictionary compiled by Chen Gongsu. The Medical Circle Guide co-edited by Song Guobin and Zhu Hengbi, published by the Chinese Medical Association, and the Emergency Treatment of the British Red Cross Society translated by Lu Dexing. As for those published privately: there are only a dozen or so titles such as the Cholera Outline co-authored by Wu Liande and others, the Pathology authored by Huang Manou, the Pharmacology compiled by Zhang Xiaozong, the Gonorrhea Truth compiled by Xie Junshou, the Bone Fracture Treatment translated by Niu Huisheng and others, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases authored by Gao Jinglang, the Medical Common Sense authored by Tao Chison, the Crude Drug Science co-authored by Zhao Yu, Huang Xubo, and Yun, and the Latest Internal Medicine Treatment Complete Book compiled by Yao Bolin. As for the medical and health series newly published by the Department of Health, Commercial Press, China Book Company, Datong Book Company, and Beixin Book Company, the number is extremely scarce, and compared with the endless stream of medical masterpieces from various countries abroad, we are truly far behind! Moreover, the simplicity of printing is even more needless to say.</p>
<p>In the 23rd year, there was no significant progress in medical journals and publications. The only ones that were barely satisfactory were the past Chinese Pharmaceutical Association of the Republic of China Journal, which is now merged with the Southeast Medical Journal, Social Medical Report, and Scientific Medical Report to form the New Medicine and Pharmaceuticals; and the Chinese Medical Journal published by the Chinese Medical Association, which is now changed to a monthly magazine, edited by Mr. Yu Yunxiu. The contents of the two journals often focus on research and investigation documents, and the richness of the materials can be said to be unparalleled in domestic medical journals. Journals such as the Social Medicine and Pharmaceutical News, now changed to the Social Medicine and Pharmaceutical Monthly, can be said to be on par with the Medical and Pharmaceutical Review in the field of medical commentary, which is another transformation. As for newly published ones, such as the Forensic Medicine Monthly, Medical Affairs Public Opinion, the Medical Weekly of the News Evening Post, the Dental Weekly, the Venereal Disease Bi-Monthly, the Anti-Tuberculosis Monthly, the Southeast School Voice, and the Hebei Public Hygiene Magazine, there are not more than a dozen or so, which clearly shows the desolation of China's medical publishing industry.</p>
<p>(VI) Medical Inspections</p>
<p>The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade. Since Chinese medicine is in its budding and growing stage, the matter of inspection cannot be delayed. Lessons can be learned from the inspection to improve Chinese medicine. The Chinese people have often neglected the importance of medical inspections. Over the past year, graduates from medical schools have made several graduation visits, but most have no statistical reports. It is just a cursory glance, with little meaning to speak of. Formal domestic medical and health institutions that can send staff abroad for inspection are almost non-existent! Dr. Wu Zhijian, sent by the Shanghai Leprosy Association to Europe for inspection in the 23rd year, was a special discovery, as rare as Dr. Wu Liande's going abroad for inspection. Mr. Weng Zhilong's inspection in the Northwest, amid the development of the Northwest, is also a valuable page.</p>
<p>What is gratifying is that the Ministry of Education seems to have the determination to reorganize medical education over the past year. In the 23rd year, it first appointed Mr. Pang Jingzhou and others to inspect medical schools in North China, and Mr. Yan Fuqing and others to inspect medical schools in East China. Although this is a supervisory nature, it is also related to the improvement of medical education. We deeply hope that based on the findings of the investigation, a direction for future medical education can be established in the shortest possible time to correct the mistakes of China's past medical education, which had no direction.</p>
<p>(VII) Medical Construction</p>
<p>In the context of a national economy that is gradually moving towards chronic bankruptcy, it is difficult to talk about medical construction. However, the addition of hospitals in various places often has no opportunity for public announcement, making it difficult to investigate. Now, taking Shanghai as an example, there are still some new creations in the 23rd year, such as the Hongqiao Sanatorium, which has simple and magnificent architecture and is extremely reasonable. As for the medical schools and hospitals under construction but not yet completed, there are the Shanghai Medical College and the Red Cross Hospital, which will build magnificent buildings at the Shanghai Baseball Field, the new practice hall of the Southeast Medical College will soon be completed, the new five-story building of Guangzi Hospital will soon be completed, and the Tongde Medical College is designing and building a school building. These are all new developments in the past year. In addition, the Jiangxi Medical College added school buildings, and the Guangxi Provincial Government is planning to establish a medical school. We all deeply hope that they can be completed soon.</p>
<p>(VIII) Military Medical Training</p>
<p>At the eve of the world war, amid the active expansion of armaments in various countries, the tragic scene of the partition of our country will soon be upon us. We are alarmed that a major disaster is imminent. For the medical community to actively train in battlefield rescue techniques in order to contribute, is certainly essential. However, military medical training is even more urgent. This is because the obligations of military doctors are not limited to wartime service, but also have a great responsibility for the prevention and treatment of diseases among soldiers during peacetime. In the summer of the 23rd year, Mr. Lu Zhide, the director of the military medical office, separately mobilized military doctors of all levels from various places to Nanchang for refresher training. He also adopted the method of training officers in the marching camp, giving military doctors the opportunity to supplement their knowledge and temper their physique, which was indeed a valuable and meaningful move. This not only benefits the soldiers with welfare but also cultivates the inherent demeanor of military doctors. We further hope that military doctors can continue to practice this every year without interruption, which will benefit the country's future and the future of public health.</p>
<p>(IX) A Glimpse of the Old Medical Field</p>
<p>In the 23rd year, the old medical field can be said to be filled with a smoky atmosphere: the Ephedra trend that was popular in Shanghai was even more unbearable. What caused the Ephedra trend? The newspapers were in an uproar, seeming to attribute it to the monopoly of a certain cooperative; however, according to people familiar with the inside story, the situation was extremely complex (please refer to the "Self-Destructive Ephedra Trend" in the third issue of the second volume of Social Medicine and Pharmaceuticals). We are not fond of discussing right and wrong, and the truth of this kind of fact is not something we should inquire about. From an academic standpoint, we deeply feel that the occurrence of this Ephedra trend has fully exposed the absurdity and unreliability of the old medical theories. Even taking the use of Ephedra to replace Fritillaria as an example, some say that the properties and tastes of Ephedra and Fritillaria are similar, and their effects are the same, so they can be substituted; others say that although the properties and tastes of Ephedra and Fritillaria are the same, their effects are completely different, and they cannot be substituted. Each holds to their own opinion, and speaks with conviction. Alas, this is enough to prove that all the theories of old medicine are mostly without absolute truth! With such theories, how can we compete with modern scientific medicine without being swept away by the tide of the times?</p>
<p>As for the medical disputes of old doctors, they have also been endless, which is due to the deteriorating social atmosphere, what more can be said! We also deeply hope that the old medical community will urgently seek to protect their practice.</p>
<p>The old medical publishing industry is lifeless, the same as it was in the past! Among them, there are those who are committed to improving old medicine, but they all lack the mind to distinguish right from wrong, lack the basis and knowledge of empirical experience, and lack a good foundation in natural sciences. They only plagiarize new knowledge, connect it to old theories, and blindly lead, having already entered a wrong path, and are not enough to speak of promoting old medical theories.</p>
<p>In recent years, medical experts at home and abroad have been devoting themselves to the study of Chinese medicine, which is very strong! Dr. Zeng Guangfang is the most diligent researcher of Chinese medicine. Dr. Zeng is currently working at the Shanghai Natural Science Institute. According to him, "In recent years, people have known that Chinese medicine has great effects, especially ginseng, which is considered to have a cardiotonic effect, but what are the ingredients of ginseng? What is its pharmacology? We do not know. This is not something that cannot be known; because to study a drug, a few or a few dozen grams are not enough as research material, one must use dozens or hundreds of kilograms. Just imagine using a hundred kilograms of ginseng, the value has reached millions. Looking around, the domestic medical and pharmaceutical field is desolate, so how can we talk about studying ginseng?" Dr. Zeng spoke with sincerity and earnestness, and we should know what to realize. Over the past year, those in the old medical field who talked about studying Chinese medicine, claiming that a certain drug has been extracted and a certain drug has clear ingredients, are simply daydreaming and cannot be relied upon.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that deserves our attention, that is, the deformed development of old medical education is still developing. In this transitional period, we dare not say that old medical schools cannot be established, nor dare we say that old medical practitioners cannot participate in social activities, as this is the right of citizens, and no one dares to剥削 it; however, in terms of the education system, old medical schools should not be included in the ranks of universities. In the winter of the 23rd year, at the independent college games held in Shanghai, a certain old medical school also participated openly due to its school qualifications. Implicitly, it has already been recognized that the old medical school is one of the modern Chinese universities. The educational authorities cannot but pay attention to this chaos in China's educational system.</p>
<h3>Etiological Treatment and Prevention of Periodontitis</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Periodontitis (Pyorrhea Alveolaris) is one of the common diseases of the oral cavity. There are many sufferers, and the harm is severe. The pus that flows out, swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, can cause diseases in all parts of the body, such as arthritis, gastric ulcer, intestinal ulcer, pneumonia, tonsillitis, purulent pharyngitis, jaundice, gallstones, enteritis and various stomatitis. At the same time, the gums are inflamed and swollen, the teeth are loose, pus often flows, and the oral cavity is very smelly, which is disgusting. If the disease is prolonged and not treated, it will inevitably affect health, cause mental fatigue, make the face sallow and the body thin. As the disease progresses, the teeth fall out and chewing becomes difficult. According to a certain American doctor, more teeth are lost due to this disease than due to cavities. Therefore, this disease is the most worthy of attention among dental diseases. After diagnosis, I have written this article based on what I have seen and heard, and with reference to the most effective treatments that have been scattered in various books and magazines in recent years, to contribute to those who care about their health.</p>
<p>Etiology</p>
<p>There are many sources of periodontitis, which can be divided into six categories:</p>
<p>(1) The teeth are unevenly arranged, the bite is incorrect, or the bridges and dentures are not properly fitted. Therefore, chewing is inconvenient, and the teeth are gradually injured due to excessive and uneven pressure, resulting in this disease.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the lime content contained in saliva and residual food, it adheres to the gingival area, or the waste matter excreted in the blood surrounds the tooth cells (Calculus), thus irritating the gums and causing inflammation. The gums separate from the teeth to form a pocket, and the tooth line and dirt accumulate more and more. At the same time, the periodontal membrane and alveolar bone are also injured and destroyed.</p>
<p>(3) After the gums are inflamed and separated, pus bacteria and parasites take the opportunity to invade and wreak havoc.</p>
<p>(4) Drug poisoning, such as oral medications containing mercury and uric acid.</p>
<p>(5) Poor oral hygiene, lack of brushing, and love of eating hard objects.</p>
<p>(6) Systemic diseases such as venereal disease, lung disease, diabetes, etc.</p>
<p>Periodontitis can be divided into three types: A, B, and C.</p>
<p>Type A periodontitis This type of disease is less severe. The symptoms are redness, swelling, and inflammation of the gums around the neck of the tooth. This is because many excretions from saliva or blood form hard black tartar, which adheres to the tooth area and between the alveolar spaces, forming a ring. This irritates the gums, resulting in redness and swelling. However, the gums do not form pockets, or if they do, they are very shallow. Pus may or may not be present. In most cases, it is absent. The inner surface of the mandibular incisors and the outer surface of the maxillary molars are most prone to tartar. The patient's oral condition shows neglect of cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
<p>Type B periodontitis This is true periodontitis. The symptoms of gingivitis are not very obvious. The gums are not only not congested, but appear anemic. The gums separate from the teeth and recede. The periodontal membrane is destroyed very quickly. At the same time, the alveolar bone is damaged and shortened. The pockets are deeper. It is often found between the incisors or molar alveolar spaces. Pus flows out constantly. The oral cavity is very smelly. Hard tartar may or may not be present. The teeth are loose and eventually fall out.</p>
<p>Type C periodontitis This disease is mostly caused by systemic diseases, such as venereal disease, lung disease, actinomycosis, osteomyelitis, diabetes, drooling, phosphorus poisoning, malnutrition, and metabolic diseases. The symptoms also vary depending on the cause. For example, if it is caused by venereal disease, tuberculosis, and osteomyelitis, the alveolar bone is severely destroyed and progresses very quickly. Therefore, the teeth are loose. Hard tartar is often found around the teeth. Pus is constantly flowing. It takes a long time to treat before it can gradually recover. If it is caused by diabetes, the gums are swollen and painful, the periodontal membrane is inflamed, and sensitivity is excessive. Tartar formed by blood is found around the teeth. Pus may or may not be present. If it is caused by metabolic diseases, the symptoms are erratic.</p>
<p>Treatment Methods</p>
<p>(1) General Discussion</p>
<p>The treatment methods for periodontitis are quite complicated and require a long period of time and careful attention to be effective. The following points must be understood and noted by both the patient and the doctor to avoid failure.</p>
<p>(1) The patient must cooperate closely with the doctor, absolutely obey the doctor's instructions, and pay attention to everything in order to obtain permanent results.</p>
<p>(2) If pus is swallowed into the stomach and absorbed into the blood, it is easy to cause systemic diseases or even blood poisoning, which has a very significant impact on health. However, patients often pay little attention to pus and are only worried about the loosening and falling out of their teeth. The doctor should pay attention to this kind of psychology.</p>
<p>(3) If the root tip has not changed, proper treatment can stop the pus and restore the health of the teeth. However, the effectiveness of the teeth will be inferior to that before the disease.</p>
<p>(4) If there are severe symptoms that cannot be cured in fact, it is best to extract the teeth as a last resort. There is no need to go through a long period of treatment, which is futile and disappointing for the patient.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding daily diet and hygiene, patients should drink more water. Slightly alkaline beverages such as soda, fruit seeds, and salt are also beneficial if consumed occasionally. In addition, the bowels should not be constipated. Eat more fruits, vegetables, and brown rice to stimulate the stomach and intestines. Eat less sugar cakes and refined pastries. Rinse your mouth immediately after eating.</p>
<p>(6) The treatment methods for periodontitis can be divided into three types, namely surgical operation, drug treatment, and instrument installation.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for the Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eyes</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(31) Scarlet Fever</p>
<p>Naming - Scarlet fever is called Scharlach by Germans and Scarlet Fever by the British. In the past, China had never heard of anything called scarlet fever. There is no record of this disease in ancient medical books. It is not even known that it is an infectious disease. The general public thought that the rashes of this disease were quite similar to measles, so they were often confused and called measles (or red measles). From the perspective of Chinese medicine, because this disease mostly combines with throat symptoms, the different names of throat measles, measles throat, rotten throat measles, and rotten throat 疔 measles are generally used. In fact, what he is discussing are all referring to scarlet fever. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Simple Explanation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (37)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>The detailed circumstances of the five types of tuberculin tests have been described above. As for their true diagnostic value, as estimated by theory, a brief account may be given here. Firstly, we must understand that their diagnostic assistance in determining whether or not the patient has this disease is, of course, undeniable. As for the current condition, such as whether it is still progressing or has reached a state of arrest, the extent of the disease, and the size of the affected area, these are far less accurate and reliable than physical examination and X-ray fluoroscopy! Secondly, considering only whether or not it is this disease, the value of a negative reaction is greater than that of a positive reaction. Regarding positive reactions, their application to children is greater than to adults. We must understand that almost no one can escape the transmission of tuberculosis. Even those who are disease-free throughout their lives were certainly infected in their infancy, which can be proven by autopsy. Therefore, even if a positive reaction is found, it is possible in everyone who has been infected, and its diagnostic value for the current disease is understandably reduced! According to this theory, a negative reaction can put an end to the suspicion of the disease being present. As for the comparison between children and adults, this can also be inferred from this!</p>
<p>Finally, in recent times, some people have also been engaged in autogenous urine reaction tests. The test procedure involves injecting several drops of the patient's own urine intradermally to observe the local reaction. In addition, there are similar tests for autogenous serum and autogenous sweat. However, their diagnostic value has not yet been determined, so it is better to omit them here to avoid being verbose!</p>

<h3>Mark Twain, the Scourge of American Citizens</h3>
<p>— Li Bo</p>
<p>From a barefoot, wild boy working in Hannibal, to liberation from colonial status, a Mississippi boatman, a wanderer for many years who reached the highest position in American literature, Mark Twain, it is exactly one hundred years since his birth.</p>
<p>Before Mark Twain, we could say that America had no literature of its own. It is true that we know America had Hawthorne, Irving, and Poe, but these people were merely imitators of British literature, inheritors of the British tradition. The literature they created was not truly American, but merely a tributary of British literature. They sought to cater not to domestic readers, but to London critics. They depicted not the rough and bold pioneers of the wilderness, but the delicate and restrained gentlemen of the salons.</p>
<p>However, the citizens who had only recently been liberated were ultimately unable to be satisfied with this. Moreover, nature was so generous to them: they had a mild climate, vast prairies, mysterious virgin forests, the magnificent Mississippi, the bountiful Californian gold mines, cheap slave labor, and the promising prospects for industrial and commercial development. Their world was one of gold and joy. They needed the adventurous spirit of the pioneers, and they also needed laughter, even if it was shallow laughter, as long as it was fresh and lively, which was exactly what they demanded.</p>
<p>They also demanded to search the world with the keen eyes of a newly released hunting dog, and to criticize everything with light satire.</p>
<p>The first to satisfy these demands, no, the first to reflect this new consciousness, was Mark Twain. His early masterpieces, filled with light-hearted jokes, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog," and his travelogue with its novel perspective, "Innocents Abroad," were able to quickly seize a wide readership in farmhouses and taverns, achieving sales like the Bible, which was by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Mark Twain himself was a fresh and vigorous figure. His personality and his style were symbols of America at that time. On May 10, 1870, precisely when his "Innocents Abroad" achieved its widest sales, and three months after his marriage to Miss Olivia Langdon, he wrote in a letter to Nevada that he had "a lovely wife; a lovely house, the house with charming decorations; a lovely carriage; and a coachman with a demeanor of awe-inspiring charm—nothing is lacking, and I earn more money than I really need." This was the prosperity of a Nevada miner in debt, wasn't it the free America that had been liberated from colonial status, passed through the Civil War, and obtained a free labor market?</p>
<p>He stepped into literature with the vigorous force of the frontier and the harmony of humor, expressing the adventurous spirit of the early settlers entirely in his own rough, often misspelled words, according to his own keen eyes. He also gave new evaluations to everything in Europe. He broke away from tradition, abandoned authority, and no dogma could bind his restless passion and light satire in the slightest.</p>
<p>"What does he satirize, this literary darling of the newly rising citizen nation?" Perhaps there is such an inquiry.</p>
<p>Although it was a newly rising citizen nation, it had old dregs and new developing problems. Therefore, there were truly many targets for the satire of our philosopher of laughter. He had literary prisoners such as Addison, Lamb, Milton, and Carlyle, and even more, he had the superintendent of the village Sunday school, children who had learned hundreds of Bible lessons, Christian scientists who praised Mrs. Eddy, stubborn Shakespeare experts, relic seekers, connoisseurs who guessed that they would be appreciated according to general principles, people who arrogantly quoted famous people's "last words," Americans who flattered the rich, tens of thousands of humble people who only had words and no actions, shameless journalists who raped people's homes with their newspapers, theologians who were certain, stubborn "scientific" boasters, sentimentalists who held grand celebrations during mourning, anarchists of behavior, professors who always quoted the words of other professors, people who got rich quickly, people who got smart quickly, and religious reformers.</p>
<p>Among all the social phenomena he mocked, he showed the greatest disrespect to religion. He said that Christian civilization was a civilization of killing, that the invention of the sharpest weapons was Christianity's most worthy victory, and he said, "In the second or third century, we will certainly see that all qualified murderers are Christians." In his "The $30,000 Bequest," there is an interesting description: "These are three cold days when she loads the goods of the gospel onto the ship, which is to persuade the shallow Chinese to exchange twenty-four pure gold Confucian doctrines for counterfeit Christianity.</p>
<p>Just as he opposed all biased social phenomena, Mark Twain's anti-religion was somewhat rough and shallow. He did not know that Christian civilization could no longer exist in the "second or third century." However, there is no doubt that his spirit grasped the progressive consciousness of the early citizen society.</p>
<h3>Smile (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Lamernce of England, translated by Tang Xiru</p>
<p>They had no children, and he was often sadly in need of children, which made him feel very sad.</p>
<p>Now she would never return to him, this was the thirteenth time, she was gone forever.</p>
<p>But was this her? As he thought this, he felt her lightly touching somewhere on his ribs, making him smile. He frowned, and a look of anger appeared on his face. He stopped smiling! As he looked down at this infinitely infuriating dead woman, he clenched his square, exposed gums, revealing his large teeth. "It's like this again!"—he really wanted to say to her like a character in a Dickens novel.</p>
<p>He himself had never learned well, and he was prepared to let his many shortcomings remain.</p>
<p>He suddenly turned back to the three women, who had retreated into the shadows beyond the candlelight, and were now hovering between him and something, wearing their white headscarves. His eyes shone, and he bared his teeth.</p>
<p>"The sin is mine! The sin is mine!" he suddenly shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Macche!" the frightened abbess cried out, quickly extending her hands, and then tucking them back into her sleeves, like a pair of small birds roosting together in a nest.</p>
<p>Matthew nodded his head, staring blankly around, ready to run out. The abbess was chanting a hymn softly behind him, her rosary swinging. The pale young nun retreated further back, but the robust, black, thoughtful nun, like a perpetually humorous star, stared at him from above, and he felt the smile tickling him in his ribs again.</p>
<p>"Listen!" he advised the women, "I am being strangely abnormal now, I think I'd better leave."</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Characters and Distinguishing Words (3)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Host—Good, let's start with Su Xun and Su Zhe's Six States essays. The Selections of Ancient Prose includes Su Xun's "On Power" (Six States), with three circles added under the title (circles were added under the title of the Selections of Ancient Prose to distinguish between good and bad). Liu Haifeng commented, "The force of the brush is simple and old." Su Zhe's "On Six States" has two circles added under the title. A comment on the eyebrow of the Xu family edition from Xiao County says, "Familiar with the situation at the time." It can be seen that these two "On Six States" essays were originally most praised by the predecessors of the Tongcheng School. The historical facts of the Six States are there. We will discuss history based on history. Which of Su Xun and Su Zhe's arguments is nonsense that we can agree with? Why did the Six States decline? Why was Qin able to unify? From a national perspective, this was an inevitable trend after a mixture matured. From the early Zhou Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn Period, from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Warring States Period, the big fish ate the small fish, and the big bugs ate the small bugs. The ebb and flow, rise and fall of various tribes and feudal lords never stopped for a single day. The decline of the Six States was no different from the process of decline of the eight hundred feudal lords. Qin's strength and unification were no different from the strength and partial unification of the seven heroes of the Warring States Period. From an economic perspective, the development of the agricultural economy determined the national fortune of a country. Since Shang Yang took power in Qin, he implemented private land ownership and rewarded large-scale production. Qin invaded the Six States, where agricultural production was backward (the nobility occupied the land, and the production methods were backward), with the wealthy Guanzhong region. The outcome of the battle was obvious. In terms of political thought and organization, Confucianism, Mohism, and Legalism all tended toward a political view of centralized power, sufficient food, and strong soldiers. The Six States' power was held by the nobility, and nothing could be reformed in a planned way. The Legalists were in power in Qin, reducing the power of the wealthy and concentrating power in the central government, implementing a plan for sufficient food and strong soldiers, naturally invincible and conquering all. Did Su Xun and Su Zhe's "On Six States" even scratch the itch at all? They said: "The destruction of the Six States was not because their weapons were not sharp or their battles were not well fought, but because of bribery to Qin. Bribery to Qin depleted their strength, and this was the path to destruction!" (Su Xun, "On Six States") And: "What Qin was competing with the feudal lords for the world was not in Qi, Chu, Yan, and Zhao, but on the outskirts of Han and Wei; what the feudal lords were competing with Qin for the world was not in Qi, Chu, Yan, and Zhao, but in the wilderness of Han and Wei... Han and Wei were a barrier for the feudal lords, but they allowed the Qin people to enter and exit between them. How could they know the situation of the world?" (Su Zhe, "On Six States") Isn't this as childish as an elementary school student's desk history essay? Would modern young people who have read a little cultural history and social history make such ridiculous arguments? It is no wonder that in the Jiawu year (1894), a censor with a Hanlin background wanted to memorialize the throne, saying, "To the north of Japan, there are two great powers, Siam and Burma, which are wealthy and have strong soldiers. I ask that the Emperor send envoys to establish good relations and attack Japan from the north and south to seal its fate." If you are willing to compare the essays of modern young people carefully with the essays of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties, you will feel that in all aspects, whether philosophy, society, or nature, they are much more advanced, at least more accurate.</p>
<p>Guest—In that case, please compare them from the aspect of organization:</p>
<p>Host—Ancient Chinese literati only had literary collections. Literary collections are like existing magazines, talking about everything under the sky and above the earth, contradicting themselves before and after, with very little organization. The pre-Qin philosophers were relatively more organized. Only Zhuangzi, Xunzi, and Han Fei can be said to have clear and coherent systems. After the Qin and Han Dynasties, only Wang Chong's "Lunheng," Liu Xie's "Wen Xin Diao Long," Liu Zhiji's "Shi Tong," and Zhang Xuecheng's "Wen Shi Tong Yi" were relatively more organized. Even a great writer like Wang Zhong's "Shuxue" was just a mixed platter and could not be said to be organized. For example, Han Yu's "Yuandao" is precisely "Confucian words are not enough, so he resorts to arrogant pretense, wandering wildly, trampling on crops and vegetables, and ultimately making mistakes in several articles." (Zhang Taiyan's words) Han Yu fundamentally did not understand the claims of Taoism, nor did he understand the claims of Buddhism, and even less did he understand the similarities and differences between Taoism and Buddhism. In short, he was not even very clear about the claims of Confucianism; therefore, he could not organize a complete theory, and he could not write a complete article. Even a famous article like "Yuandao" is so incoherent, not to mention those mediocre ancient prose. No matter how undesirable modern young people are, at least they have received a little logical training and read some European and American papers, and they will never contradict themselves like Han Yu. There is no need to say anything else. If you just look at those writers of the Tongcheng School, can any writer be as meticulous as Yan Fu or as vivid as Lin Shu? Moreover, does Lin Shu himself have any works that are as good as his own translations? Furthermore, when Zhang Shizhao lectures on literary editing, his articles have vitality; once he delves into the horns of a dilemma and tries to restore the past, nine out of ten of his articles are incomprehensible. Adding another "moreover," all those who have been baptized by Western literature show their characteristics. (Zhang Taiyan's essays are deeply influenced by Buddhism and did not come from ancient prose of the Tang and Song Dynasties.) Therefore, in terms of organization, modern young people are also much more advanced than others, at least more meticulous than the ancient prose masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties.</p>
<p>Guest—Your high regard for the present and your suppression of the past are certainly justifiable and reasonable; but I am still not very clear as to why reading the articles of the ancients always feels much better than the articles of the present people.</p>
<p>Host—This is your traditional thinking at work! Mr. Tang Bohuang said it well: "The ancient is elegant, and the present is vulgar, which is human nature. The more ancient something is, the more elegant it seems. Writing cannot escape this example. The reasons for this are complex: one is due to the rarity of ancient objects: things that are rare are treasured, and things that are treasured are elegant. Ritual vessels are like this, and so is writing. The second is due to the fact that later generations often idealize the past; we do not see the ancients, and we often imagine their lives to be ideal; therefore, the golden age must be in ancient times. The third is due to the fact that the language of modern people, because it is commonly used in daily life, often makes us associate with concrete situations in the present world—many unsatisfactory and impure things. The writing of the ancients, because it is different from the current language, does not produce such associations, so we feel that it is relatively less vulgar. This psychological effect of 'the ancient is elegant and the present is vulgar' often makes you feel that reading the articles of the ancients is much better than the articles of the present people. Excuse me for telling a joke, when you feel that the articles of the ancients are particularly good, you really haven't understood the articles of the ancients yet! The predecessors did not understand the "Book of Documents" and regarded "Pan Geng" as a treasured article; modern people do not understand the eight-legged essay, and some people also regard that kind of stinking and mediocre tune as a good article; once they understand it, they will not love that damn thing! The times are always advancing. If I were an ancient person, I would certainly hope that the articles of later generations would be more advanced than mine. Each generation should be better than the last, and this is the main road for cultural progress. If the Chinese language proficiency of modern young people is really declining day by day, each generation being worse than the last, and later generations all become fools, what glory is there for the ancients?</p>
<h3>A Man and a Woman</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>Early morning.</p>
<p>Before I even reached the bridgehead, I saw the riverbank crowded with a dark mass of people. When I reached the bridgehead, I couldn't help but stop and, amid the noisy, laughing voices of the people, cast my gaze at the same focal point as they did.</p>
<p>This river is a tributary of the Daqing River, commonly called the Xiaoqing River. The water is extremely clean, clear, and bright, with lines of ripples chasing each other, flowing slowly in the deep brown, not very wide riverbed, always so leisurely. The morning sun reflected the centipede boats moored near the bridgehead, leaving extremely soft, snake-like shadows in the heart of the water. In the distance, a very large corpse floated up and down, like a skinned cow.</p>
<p>A variety of voices arose from the crowd:</p>
<p>"Could it be that the upstream has flooded again—the river water is not muddy...?"</p>
<p>"How could that be a person, a person is not that big...?"</p>
<p>"How could there be someone so silly, livestock that fall into the river are not fed to people...?"</p>
<p>More and more people gathered at the bridgehead and along the bank. From the east of the river and the west of the river, this was an important transportation route. Those carrying poles and those carrying baskets, one by one with their yellow mud legs and wearing pale, shimmering cloth shirts, crowded to make way. Those behind asked those in front: "What's going on? Did someone jump into the river!" The people in front did not answer, but squeezed even harder.</p>
<p>In the middle of the river, the corpse followed the current, breaking the ripples and rising and falling. Closer, it was clear. At this time, the faces of the young lads turned red, and they smiled, unexpectedly exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Hey—a man and a woman!"</p>
<p>The faces of the women standing on the bow of the centipede boat watching the excitement also turned red, and they spat out a mouthful of saliva, but they still looked back greedily for another hard look, and then successively turned into the cabin, shouting at their children, cat or dog, "Come in, come in, don't dirty your eyes!"</p>
<p>"This is really what a world," an old man sighed, "to produce such a disgrace!"</p>
<p>I saw the corpse gradually flowing towards the bridge. It was indeed so, a man and a woman were tightly tied together, facing each other. The corpses had been in the water for quite some time, and the river water had permeated into every cell of their bodies. The people were swollen like cows. As a rule, floating corpses flow on their backs, but now, because the balance of the two people was inconsistent, slightly agitated on the water's surface, they would turn over.</p>
<p>"Heh-heh-heh." Every young person was happy. "They're still moving!"</p>
<p>The corpses slowly passed through the heart of the river among the centipede boats. People were noisily discussing the reasons for the crime of these two young people. People were all standing with their hands in their sleeves, and no one proposed to rescue or bury them. I knew that this kind of thing was close to "bad luck". Boatmen were sometimes afraid of breaking their good fortune. If it were a single person, there would certainly have been philanthropists already.</p>
<p>The corpse reached the side of the bridge. The man's face was facing upwards. Seeing that face, a familiar shock in my memory, yes, I recognized this face, although it was now swollen and pale. When I saw the scar on his forehead, I knew it was him, although for a moment, I could not call out his name.</p>
<p>So I hurriedly squeezed down from the bridgehead to find You Er, You Er, this old boatman, had already died without an heir. I thought that he probably wouldn't mind this kind of thing. Finding him in the crowd, I said:</p>
<p>"You should accumulate some virtue, Lao Er, pull them out and find someone to bury them. Get the money from me!"</p>
<p>You Er put his dry tobacco pouch in his waist and agreed.</p>
<p>"It's the school teacher who is doing good deeds after all," some passersby praised me, "It's really not right to show these indecent things to men and women under the sun!"</p>
<p>The sun was high, and when I came back from the elementary school, I saw that the people were already in the coffin. You Lao Er said, "Just let them lie in one coffin." At this time, I saw the woman's face clearly again. I understood in my heart that I not only recognized the man, but I also recognized this woman. They were my first students when I was running a community school upstream of the Daqing River, and they were also my helpers.</p>

<h3>China is China of the World</h3>
<p>— Tie Di</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch, Professor Boschmann of Germany is coming to China to study ancient Chinese architecture. Professor Boschmann is a scholar specializing in architectural studies. He came to China before 1909, and then came to China again in 1933 to begin his research on China. On January 8th, he returned to his country on the "Saarbrücken," having spent fifteen months visiting thirteen provinces. Half of his research was on ancient Chinese architecture, especially religious architecture, particularly temples and pagodas, and half was on the innovation and transformation of Chinese architecture in a changing era. He also studied Chinese farmers and their residences, observing new and old art, especially urban architecture.</p>
<p>From the above news, it seems that it is something to rejoice about. Why is that? Some people think that our country's architecture is indeed progressing. For example, Professor Boschmann's coming to China can be taken as a good example. In fact, it is not so.</p>
<p>Is our country's architecture really progressing? No. On the surface, although Western-style buildings of more than ten or twenty stories have appeared, in fact, these achievements do not completely belong to us. The representatives of imperialist countries are still in the position of guidance. In other words, all the rights are being manipulated in their hands.</p>
<p>Then, since we understand these meanings, what is Professor Boschmann here for? In short, he is also a representative of the imperialists. His purpose in studying Chinese architecture is not to provide him with research materials, but to imitate all the phenomena of our country's architecture, in order to plan everything, in other words, to plan for future monopoly!</p>
<p>In this changing era, imperialism feels that it is about to be shaken, so they are mutually exclusive, pushing and snatching from each other. As a result, they cannot achieve victory in this environment, and thus they develop madly towards colonies or semi-colonies, hoping to find something ideal for them in this arena.</p>
<p>What is Professor Boschmann's mission in coming to China? Of course, he cannot escape the atmosphere of imperialism. Therefore, it can be seen that his mission in coming to China has great significance. From this, everyone also feels that China is China of the world!</p>
<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>The winter evening is lonely.</p>
<p>Returning from the field, dusk crawls into every corner of the small room. I'm too lazy to flip the light switch – in fact, turning on the sixteen-candlepower electric light would only accentuate the dimness of dusk, making one feel a low, oppressive atmosphere. I take off my winter coat and throw my tired body onto the sofa, stretching out my legs like a traveler arriving at a small inn, needing only rest.</p>
<p>No thoughts, eyes vaguely closed, isolating all sounds from my hearing, but not quite asleep. If someone were to burst in as if I were expecting them, I would be able to jump up the moment their foot stepped inside.</p>
<p>But I dare not hope, for the winter evening is lonely; there is no fireplace with roaring flames here, no rich coffee, and certainly no charming woman, like the life in high-rise buildings, passing the winter evening in an atmosphere full of springtime.</p>
<p>Though I say there are no thoughts, my mind, like an annoying creditor, barges in mercilessly: I remember when we had a brazier.</p>
<p>It was midnight, with heavy snow falling, when I eloped with my lover, fleeing the feudal forces that permeated our hometown like poisonous flames. We ran without stopping all night, and at daybreak, we arrived at a friend's house – three thatched huts in a small village.</p>
<p>Brushing off the thick layer of snow that weighed us down, we collapsed into bamboo chairs beside the brazier. Our bodies were so tired they could no longer support us, but our spirits were excited. We toasted bread to stave off hunger, and our faces, illuminated by the firelight, smiled at each other; I remember being startled out of the silence only when the flames burned our feet.</p>
<p>In this way, we spent every winter evening beside the brazier. But this enjoyment, like winter, was driven away by the god of spring when the swallows returned.</p>
<p>Since then, I have had no home. With wounded feet, I have traveled all over the country, spending countless lonely winter evenings.</p>
<p>This unforgettable image immediately reappears before my eyes as I rest, so I open my eyes to find darkness. Only the rhythmic sound of a wandering monk's wooden fish drum approaches from afar. Wanderer, what do you seek?</p>
<p>I rise from the darkness, groping for the light switch on the wall. The light from the sixteen candles casts my elongated shadow outside the door, like a hibernating snake.</p>
<p>Looking into the dark corridor, I desperately hope for an uninvited guest to share my pointless worries. Even if it were truly a creditor, I would treat them as an honored guest, but this hope, like the sound of the wooden fish drum, tells me – this world is empty.</p>
<p>From one corner to the other, I pace back and forth, the lonely shadow flickering wildly on the four walls, as if discovering the answer to a difficult question, entrusting the lost balance of my thoughts to its movements, forgetting the faintly aching wounds on the soles of my feet.</p>
<p>Finally, a cold air rises from my heels to my body, and the first crowing of the rooster and the rhythmic sound of the wooden fish drum sound at the same time. I raise my distracted eyes and look out the window, a sheet of white reflected light. The roofs across the street are covered with cotton-like thick snow, and it seems as if my mind has also been swept clean. I open the window and take a deep breath of cold air.</p>
<p>"Another lonely winter night has passed!" I mutter to myself.</p>
<p>"But what about this evening's dusk?" I ask myself.</p>
<p>"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" a voice answers me.</p>
<p>But spring, ah, is the season when the swallows return!</p>
<h3>Heavenly Kingdom on the South Sea</h3>
<p>— San Lang</p>
<p>"Doumen is a heavenly kingdom facing the South Sea!"</p>
<p>The name Doumen is so enchanting. It is a small island in the South Sea, a ten-hour boat trip from Macau. Last year, I wandered there.</p>
<p>Doumen is indeed as miraculous as I imagined! High, overlapping mountain peaks winding along. Seen from the sea, it is a beautiful painting, with enchanting scenery, semi-tropical forests, lush and thriving, containing a gentle and lovely atmosphere, permeating the heart of a traveler with a sad melody.</p>
<p>Although Doumen does not have the grand buildings of a metropolis, nor the dark scenes of prostitutes, it everywhere reveals the wounds of being ravaged by soldiers! It deeply stirred my thoughts! Look, this small island</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The people inside have not lost their freedom, nor their desire to live. It was just after a drought, and everything planted had withered. The harvest was small. But the soldiers still increased the river protection tax by six cents per mu. Heavens! Their lives are screaming in the hands of the executioners of tyranny. In Doumen, I heard an old man tell the story of Doumen:</p>
<p>"More than ten years ago, this place was still a kingdom of pirates. The soldiers had no way to deal with them, because the pirates were mostly locals, brave and fierce, willing to do anything, even risk their lives, for food. The war lasted for several years, with both sides having warships. It was really exciting. However, it eventually calmed down, and a new batch of soldiers came, making the lives of the common people even more miserable. All kinds of levies and taxes! After the harvest, a large portion of the grain had to be taken away. Such a life is not as good as it was more than ten years ago."</p>
<p>The people of Doumen are all sighing. The hurried tone, the painful roar, gave me an indelible and profound impression:</p>
<p>"Doumen on the South Sea is no longer a heavenly kingdom!"</p>
<p>The countryside of Doumen is so beautiful, with few modern buildings. The people's way of life still retains the old ways. However, this small island has already opened up several long roads, connecting the east, west, north, and south of the island. There are also many old-fashioned cars roaring and running. However, the people in the countryside no longer feel any surprise. They have been influenced by the big cities. They have tasted many different flavors. They have long been whipped by the exploiters from the cities. They have found courage in a painful life. What they demand is life. In the past few years, Doumen has seen many instances of hand-to-hand combat between the common people and the soldiers. When I traveled there, it was just after a fierce bloody fight. The deep wounds were still so clearly before my eyes.</p>
<p>Although Doumen is a small island filled with enchanting atmosphere, with beautiful scenery and lovely, spirited people, I ultimately left with a disappointed tone.</p>
<p>"Doumen is no longer a heavenly kingdom on the South Sea. Everywhere reveals the wounds of having been ravaged."</p>
<h3>On the Great River</h3>
<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>A large flock of ducks drifts downstream along the riverbank; Old Fan, who herds the ducks, sits in a large wooden tub, following behind, commanding them. These drifting people of the rivers and lakes drift along with the ducks!</p>
<p>It is already dusk.</p>
<p>The vast mountain range, pressed down by the dim sky, stands in the increasingly thick twilight, hanging its head. A not-so-dense swarm of black dots spreads across the mountain range; it is a flock of crows returning to their nests, their loud, abrupt cries left in the sky, echoing and lingering. Ah, the cries of the returning birds are so melancholic, so mournful in the ears of this wanderer!</p>
<p>Because in this lonely space, this lonely space filled with twilight, besides the returning birds, the mountain range, the ducks, and a lone duck herder; there is only the river singing a flowing melody, accompanied by the slightly chilly evening wind of late autumn. Therefore, this occasional cry, to him—this drifter of the rivers and lakes—at least, will feel a little comfort, a little warmth.</p>
<p>The mountain range drifted past.</p>
<p>Next, a stretch of withered yellow grassland unfolds ahead. In the distant border, the dim sky and the monotonous withered yellow are separated only by a not-so-obvious, blurry black line.</p>
<p>On the shore over there, farther away, there is still an unbroken mountain range; however, the darkness of dusk has begun to swallow them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the heart of this drifting Old Fan is filled with melancholy, sorrow, and an inexplicable emptiness. Just like the twilight that permeates the vast river surface and the vast sky.</p>
<p>One or two ducks strayed from the flock, and he busily used a bamboo pole to drive them back. This flock of ignorant ducks quietly and docilely listens to the "march" of the river.</p>
<p>In the distant harbor, a few masts stand in the blur. In the haze, a few faint lights tremble. Seeing that the place of return is about to be reached, this lost and lonely heart then rises with eager hope.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I feel excited.</p>
<p>That bright place of return!</p>
<p>The rest that the drifter has tired of all day has appeared like dawn.</p>
<h3>Making a Home</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Mentioning the words "making a home" now seems rather corrupt and ridiculous. The meaning of the words "making a home" is to be thrifty and economical. Speaking of making a home, I think of such a thing.</p>
<p>In *The Scholars*, Yan Jiansheng earned more than a hundred thousand in family wealth. When he was dying, phlegm went in and out of his throat. One sound after another, he could not take his last breath. He took his hand out of the blanket, stretched out two fingers, and no one around him could guess his meaning. Only his concubine, Zhao, knew what was on his mind. She picked off one of the two lamp wicks burning in the lamp. Only then did Yan Jiansheng feel relieved, nodded, let his hand fall, and immediately lost his breath.</p>
<p>There is an old lady in my hometown who is almost eighty or ninety years old this year. In her early years, she lacked food and clothing and was extremely poor. Now she has actually taught her children to become famous and has also accumulated hundreds of thousands in family wealth. She has two maxims for managing a home: "What teaches what is embarrassing, what teaches what doesn't care about this." These two sentences seem extremely ordinary at first glance, but when you savor them carefully, they contain great truth. What is called "what teaches what is embarrassing" refers to all expenses. Expenses should naturally be saved if they can be saved. If they cannot be saved, they may still be saved. Even if they must be spent, only a very small number or very small things should be given to people. People around you will definitely say that they are embarrassed, but she strongly opposes it, saying, "What teaches what is embarrassing." What is called "what teaches what doesn't care about this" refers to all income. No matter how small, she is unwilling to give it up easily. People around you will definitely say that they don't care about this, but she will never agree, saying, "What teaches what doesn't care about this."</p>
<p>These two methods of making a home are indeed too mean and too ridiculous, but in the past, many families did start like this, because people in the past were very frugal with themselves and did not desire extravagance. Therefore, the ancients had a saying, "If you earn a thousand coins and spend more than a thousand coins, you are poor even if you are rich. If you earn one coin and spend less than one coin, you are rich even if you are poor." Now is the world of social interaction and material civilization. Luxury is the prevailing custom. If you still do this, it is like "walking with a saw, cutting off a step with every step." You absolutely cannot do it.</p>
<p>Modern thoughts and environment are absolutely different from the past. Material desires are very high, and life seeks comfort, so in general, the mind only thinks of ease, leisure, beauty, fashion, Western-style houses and cars, high officials and generous salaries, and beautiful wives and concubines, circling in the mind every day. These extravagant desires are naturally not easy to achieve. Therefore, those with weak ambitions become bored, depressed, depressed, trapped, passive, and suicidal. Those with strong willpower take risks and commit crimes. Nothing is impossible. Therefore, young people living in the present era are really in great danger. The temptation of the environment, the greatness of hope, and the road of life are becoming narrower and narrower. Therefore, for modern young people, there is only to cut off desires and bury oneself in hard work in order to have a way out. As the saying goes, "One must suffer hardship in order to be above others," otherwise, it is a dead end.</p>
<h3>Lost</h3>
<p>— Ronin</p>
<p>A red-hot heart born from the earth, but now, it is lost on the human journey.</p>
<p>Carrying this active heart, along with the body given by my mother, I have walked through the world. I have endured thorns, crossed vast deserts, and climbed over high mountains. But what has humanity given me? What taste has the world brought me?</p>
<p>The world shows me a cruel face, and humanity shows me a cold countenance. The red-hot heart is killed by the sharp thorns of life, and the bright red blood is sucked dry by society.</p>
<p>What remains is loneliness and solitude – a specimen of a heart squeezed dry.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly tried to break the dark knots that surround me, regardless of the consequences; but the knots become tighter and tighter. I have also resisted that brutal face with all my heart and soul, but the menacing face comes closer and closer...</p>
<p>Every time: one disillusionment has just passed, and another setback comes. The darkness is like a bottomless abyss, and the sandbars spread out before my eyes are so vast that they have no end.</p>
<p>In the sorrow of failure, I lost my courage. In repeated stumbles, I became exhausted. The hot blood has gradually cooled, and the circulation of blood seems to be nearing exhaustion.</p>
<p>From the wounds all over my body, I勉强爬起来, look up, and see that I am still surrounded by a boundless desert, and I cannot see a trace of light in the future. The thick fog is layered around me, and the wind and hail attack me forever.</p>
<p>Ah, where is the light? Where is the oasis with a spring of water!</p>
<p>Should I bury my hot blood and red heart in this wilderness? Or should I find a way out of this maze?</p>
<p>But where is the road? Where is the resource that supplies the lifeblood of my heart?</p>
<p>Earth, please bring the red heart you gave birth to out of the maze! Earth, your son has now become a little lamb lost in the maze!</p>

<h3>Tears of a Camel</h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>(Dragging its heavy steps, in the vast desert, the herd of camels forever advances on its long journey. Although the yellow sand shrouds it like fog, unable to see the green grass and clear water, the knife-like north wind, the Mongolian's strong whip, and the heavy, unbearable cargo, are all endured by the sturdy camel. With a share of perseverance, and a share of the spirit of enduring hardship, patiently, step by step, it treads over the desolate desert land. Camels have no tears, because they know that endurance is an indispensable skill.)</p>
<p>Once living in a mountain temple in West Lake, the young man had no home. His wandering footprints had trod through the cities of the Pearl River basin, and also trod through every alley in the ancient capital. However, what did he have? He was a homeless wanderer, driven by the whip of life, just like the journey of a camel, the power to decide was in the hands of the driver.</p>
<p>The soft and greasy lake wind could not hold a wanderer's heart. Finally, he was taken away by a long line of Shanghai-Hangzhou trains, and abandoned in the city colored by the neon lights. His faltering steps dragged over asphalt roads, dragged over rugged narrow lanes. Fortunately, he sold his brains at the lowest price.</p>
<p>The circle of life tightened the wanderer's actions, so, like a camel, in the desert-like journey of life, he allowed the long, long time to dominate the joy of his youth, and crawled, dragging his heavy steps,含着人生的苦涙, step by step, onto the desolate journey of life.</p>
<p>Yes, he had accepted the leather whip of life with the greatest patience. However, when he looked at himself in the mirror, gazing at his thin triangular face and his unkempt beard, he could not help but sigh. He grabbed the old blue cloth coat he was wearing, and a torch of anger was ignited. However, reality was a black iron hand, it extinguished his anger, forcing him to bow to the shackles of the current system, like a tamed lamb, hanging down his tears. These tears, he had kept for a long time, after all, he shed tears.</p>
<p>(The camel trudging in the desert has a share of perseverance, and a share of the spirit of enduring hardship, however, the north wind blows on its brown hair, the Mongolian's leather whip whips its legs, the heavy cargo presses all over its flesh. At this time, the camel will also shed bitter tears.)</p>
<h3>Citizens Who Can't Queue</h3>
<p>— Gao Han</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went back to ×× because of something at home. I arrived at the North Station early, before ticket sales had started. I was waiting at the window. As usual, the crowd was very congested; people were pushing and shoving to be first. Later, an announcement was made that ticket sales had begun. So, like everyone else, I挤着as if my life depended on it. I managed to buy a ticket, and like everyone else, I boarded the train as if I were in a race. Just as I grabbed a window seat, sat down, and breathed a sigh of relief, I reached into my pocket and found that my pocket watch, which I had used for four years, was gone.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had an unpleasant trip. I was annoyed by myself, thinking about this and that in my mind, and constantly glaring angrily at the passengers in front of me who were sitting blankly, and the vendors selling various snacks. Undoubtedly, I was treating everyone in this carriage as an enemy.</p>
<p>Citizens who can't queue – I seemed to mutter to myself, scolding someone in the dark.</p>
<p>Regarding the characteristic of Chinese people not being able to queue, I'm afraid everyone deeply feels it, right? Whether at train stations, theaters, or assembly halls – in short, in all public places, Chinese people are unwilling to maintain order and enter and exit in a "single file." Perhaps some people think this habit is unimportant; however, I see a more serious meaning in it.</p>
<p>"Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs." These two sentences are the golden rule for Chinese people in dealing with the world. But in reality, what meaning does this contain? It is to tell you to only take care of yourself and never care about what others do. Last time, when someone was shot and killed by thugs on Avenue Joffre, it was not the victim's compatriots who went to the police station to report it, but a foreigner in our country: seeing this news in the newspaper, we cannot but be filled with emotion. And the overseas Chinese who failed miserably at the hands of organized foreign businessmen because they did not understand mutual assistance, isn't that also because of this philosophy of dealing with the world?</p>
<p>Some foreigners know this "problem" of the Chinese very well: so they are used to using the two methods of inciting internal strife and defeating them individually to deal with the Chinese. Please study the history of modern China's decline carefully!</p>
<p>But the Chinese are never willing to give up their ideas of thinking they are smart and thinking it is beneficial to themselves. If one day China were to perish, it would undoubtedly perish because of this "problem"!</p>
<p>And not being willing to queue, if you think about it carefully, isn't it the most obvious manifestation of this "problem"?</p>

<p>Opening "Shanghai Socialite"</p>
<p>A beautiful woman is alone in her fragrant room. Leaning lazily against the cool bed, her charming face. Her eyes are sleepy and still tired. Yawning again and again, languid. Her jade bracelet is crystal clear and green. Reflecting the snow-white skin, as white as frost. Her delicate posture is like a fresh flower. Raindrops on peony and spring begonias. Opening her mouth, she repeatedly commands the maid. Wanting to wash and have a fragrant bath. In a flash, a young maid walks in. Pouring water, brewing tea, serving busily. She gets up to wash and apply makeup. Instantly, the whole room feels fragrant. In the diamond mirror, her beautiful face shines. Shining so that there are no flaws or complaints. She tidies herself up, feeling tired. Smoking a White Gold Dragon, she walks to the window. A fan is turned on beside her. Instantly, a cool breeze spreads throughout her body. She orders the radio to be turned on. Quietly listening to records, she is infinitely happy. Some are singing Shanghai opera. Some are singing cross-talk. Some are singing Beijing opera. Some are singing Kun opera. All are Northern and Southern tunes. Smiling slightly when it sounds good. Cursing when she hears something witty. She calms her breath and feels comfortable. A maid brings in bird's nest soup. A bowl of white fungus with sugar. In the afternoon, she invites her little sisters. To play mahjong with bone tiles. When night comes, she feels hot. She goes for a drive on a motorcycle to cool off. This is also. Innate good fortune is extraordinary.</p>

Thinking that I have many concubines in the three palaces and six courtyards. I have never seen such beauty. Indeed, beauty comes from poverty. Opening his golden mouth. Calling the jade beauty. Asking her to pour wine. Asking her name and family carefully. Happily, she uses the word "Phoenix" as her beautiful name. The wine falls quickly into her stomach, and her feelings are doubled. Not revealing his status as the emperor of ten thousand chariots. Wanting to cover the clouds with rain. Who knew that this woman from a humble family had lofty ambitions. Hearing the teasing, she closes the door in anger. The dragon robe appears, dazzling her eyes. Looking up. She is instantly startled. Without asking, she knows that he is the emperor. Hurriedly kneeling on the dusty ground. Repeatedly calling "Long live." The emperor smiles and takes her hands. Bestowing upon her the grace of the Western Palace. Together they return to the Forbidden City.</p>

<p>Sending Qi Muqian Home After Failing the Examination - Wang Wei</p>
<p>In this enlightened age, there are no hidden talents, all brilliant souls come to serve. Thus, the recluse of Dongshan cannot care for gathering ferns. Now that you are far from the Golden Gate, who says that my path is wrong? Crossing the Yangtze and Huai Rivers during the Cold Food Festival, sewing spring clothes in the capital. Setting up wine on Chang'an Road, my companions disagree with me. You will soon set sail with cassia oars, and soon brush against the bramble gates. Distant trees carry traveling guests, a lonely city faces the setting sun. My plans are not suitable for use, do not say that there are few who understand me!</p>
<p>Green Creek - Wang Wei</p>
<p>Saying to enter Yellow Flower Creek, always following the Green Creek water. Following the mountains for thousands of turns, the journey is less than a hundred miles. The sound is noisy among the chaotic rocks, the color is quiet in the deep pines. Rippling, floating on water chestnuts and duckweed, clear, reflecting reeds. My heart has always been leisurely, the clear stream is so calm, please stay on the millstone, I will fish and stop here!</p>

<h3>Responding to the Needs of the Times Lido Grand Theater Will Be Completed</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Shanghai is the Paris of the East! It possesses everything that the most modern city of the twentieth century has. Rows of chimneys, bustling carriages, busy people; working all day long, using their brains. Under these circumstances, to obtain a noble form of entertainment in one's spare time, there is simply no more suitable place than a movie theater, and what we urgently need is a theater for first-run movies.</p>
<p>Shanghai is also the New York of the East, a paradise for extravagance, splendor, wealth and wealthy merchants, and a playground for important politicians. Gold is everywhere, and second-run movie theaters seem unnecessary. However, in such a large Shanghai, with more than three million people, how many are wealthy merchants, tycoons, politicians, and important people? They are only a very small number! From this point of view, the audience of first-run movie theaters, in addition to the wealthy, are mostly due to the lack of second-run movie theaters that are suitable for the times, or because the enjoyment they receive is too different from the price they pay. Therefore, the second-run movie theaters that we advocate as urgently needed should have all the equipment of first-run movie theaters, but only charge half the price. So that everyone can have the opportunity to entertain their minds and bodies. We must strive to achieve comfortable equipment and low prices. Now, the Lido Grand Theater, which is about to be completed at the corner of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road, has more luxurious and magnificent equipment than first-run movie theaters.</p>
<p>The construction of the Lido Grand Theater is entirely three-dimensional. All patterns, colors, designs, configurations, and even the patterns on the ground have been carefully considered by experts.</p>
<p>For sound movies, of course, special attention should be paid to the sound. The sound system purchased by Lido is produced by Western Electric Company. Of course, this is the most satisfactory sound system, but in order to guarantee the sound, a huge amount of money was spent to purchase non-combustible, positive sound paperboard Celotex to be inlaid on the walls to absorb sound waves, so that there is no echo problem. Among the movie theaters in this city, only the Great Shanghai and Lido have this equipment. At the same time, Lido's projectors have sufficient non-wiring, except for a few first-run theaters, I am afraid that none can compare to it.</p>
<p>As for the seat equipment, we should pay more attention to it. During the two-hour viewing time, we really don't want to suffer physical pain. The entire Lido theater now uses spring-cushioned seats, and the height and width of the position are all satisfactory to us. In addition to all the luxury and comfort, it charges extremely low prices. With the equipment of a first-run movie theater and only charging half the price, I am afraid that only Lido can do it!</p>
<p>In terms of management, under the management of someone with more than 20 years of movie theater experience, the safety and comfort of the audience can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Lido is about to open, let's look forward to it!</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Suspicion and Deep Love"</h3>
<p>— Warren</p>
<p>Beady for Love Great Light</p>
<p>Due to accidental misunderstandings, rumors spread widely, and then were embellished to form a so-called "public opinion." A lively scene turned into many tragic and comedic stories for the parties involved in confusion. This is very dramatic. Irish female writer Gregory's "City Tiger" (translated as "Rumor") is a famous play made from these materials. However, if the author does not critically focus on the social significance of such events, then no matter how bizarre and interesting the event itself is, and no matter how clever and wonderful the author's technique is, what is created will inevitably be just like this.</p>
<p>"Suspicion and Deep Love" is such an example. It tells the story of a young girl, Mary Ke, who cried because she lost her beloved puppy. People mistakenly thought she was the mistress of a certain libertine who was holding a funeral at the time, so she was disgraced by everyone. Women envied and despised her under the mask of hypocrisy. However, the dance hall manager and theater owners regarded her as a tool to make money and hired her with heavy money.</p>
<p>Now that "yellow news" is especially welcomed by the general public in this turbulent and distressed society, if the playwright can emphatically expose and satirize Mary Ke's unfortunate experience, targeting the "fabricated rape case" and "false lawsuit case" of certain people, it may not be possible to make a meaningful film. However, the playwright only conventionally focused on the love entanglement between Mary Ke and a young reporter, dragging the tail of lovers finally getting married, and vulgarizing the extremely dramatic subject matter.</p>
<p>It is true that it also exposes the fact that the libertine, who was notorious during his lifetime, was given a grand funeral after his death, and celebrities were invited to cover up his shame, and uses satirical techniques to talk about the relationship between father and son, and husband and wife. However, the author did not deal with it with an exposing or satirical attitude, but only touched on it slightly for the development of the play or to add jokes.</p>
<p>From the perspective of performance, director Marion Gering's technique is still light and fast, such as using the soft sound of the milk truck to write out this quiet school dormitory, which cannot contain this active woman. The several appearances of Mary Ke's puppy weight the development of the plot later, but it does not feel tedious. From the instructions of Mary Ke's mother to her on the train, from Mary Ke's charming and lovable attitude in the "basketball meeting" to her shame and resentment when she was tied up and humiliated, she showed her innocence. The change of scenes and tones is quite lively and beautiful. The scene where the young reporter advises Mary Ke to become a dancer, and his quarrel with her mother and managers, is also very lively and powerful. However, the process of Mary Ke feeling empty after losing the reporter Qiu Lin and suddenly realizing it is too fast. I think it would be more effective if she had a successful performance on stage, or if another young man had some love entanglement with her before looking for Qiu Lin again, for the aforementioned Qiu Lin's angry departure.</p>
<p>Ida Lupino played better. Li Qiaolun's personality and physique seem unsuitable for playing the role of a small-town reporter.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>It is unbelievable that Shirley Temple would lose 10,000 gold yuan in a week. The fact is this: a broadcasting station in Green Shirt Shore once asked Shirley to broadcast for the station for a reward of 3,500 gold yuan per week; and a theater troupe in New York was willing to hire her to perform on stage for 6,500 gold yuan per week. However, Shirley's parents, fearing that she would become more famous as a result, and that things would become uncontrollable in the future, simply and happily refused for her. That is to say, she lost 10,000 gold yuan in a week!</p>
<p>According to reports, every year, a total of 5,000 girls come to Hollywood, willing to become stars. However, only about two percent of them can truly achieve their goals. The White Byram Stanley couple, seeing this pitiful fact, expressed their sympathy for these girls very much, so in order to help them, they hired thirteen maids!</p>
<p>Ramon Novarro's brother, Antonio Samaniego, recently founded a film company in Mexico. It is said that this Novarro, who has long retired from the film industry, will star in a film. This is truly an expression of brotherly love.</p>
<p>Recently, Gary Cooper's father was injured by a car, and this filial son Gary, I heard, put aside his filming work and sat in the hospital to take care of his father for three consecutive days.</p>
<p>Famous director Frank Capra signed a new three-year contract with MGM again. Hearing this really makes people "brighten their eyes." He always rests for eight months a year! So he only works for four months a year. A money-maker is indeed extraordinary!</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse creator Walt Disney will sue a biscuit company. The reason is that without his permission, the company actually manufactured "Mickey Mouse-shaped" biscuits!</p>
<p>News came that Universal Pictures will set up a production field in Germany specializing in foreign language versions.</p>
<h3>Movie Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Some people think that Chinese film companies should make supernatural films, because making supernatural films can improve Chinese film technology.</p>
<p>Yes, just like ordinary gentlemen, they only ask for "technology" and "genius," and they are unwilling and unhappy to care about how the Chinese people are being anesthetized and poisoned.</p>
<p>If those gentlemen are not kicked out one day, then the Chinese film industry will not be saved one day.</p>
<p>Lili Hayworth will star in a musical song and dance film "Invitation to the Waltz" for B.L. Company in England.</p>
<p>American famous playwright Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur are preparing a satirical play for Jimmy Savo, "Laugh, Clown, Laugh!" It is rumored that Savo will be Chaplin's strong rival.</p>

<h3>相逢待嫁（Forsaking all Ochers）（三）</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Geoffrey was shocked when he arrived at Manli's house. He stood in the outer room, his back to the signed wall, looking at the hall inside, which was full of guests, men and women, bustling back and forth, talking and laughing. Some were holding champagne glasses and drinking cocktails, some were dancing to the jazz music from the radio, and some were standing idly smoking. Eleanor, dancing, approached Geoffrey, the first to see him. In a moment, Geoffrey became the center of a large group. Everyone asked him questions at once, making him unable to keep up. He looked around, searching for Manli, and Dielun came over. He was delighted to see his old friend after so many years. He could hardly believe that it was really Geoffrey back from abroad. "This is great! This is strange! This place is only missing you… You've really come back!" he said, one after another.</p>
<p>Geoffrey was puzzled and said, "What exactly is going on? What are all these people here for?" Dielun said, "Don't you know yet? What's the matter? Oh… I thought you came specifically for this! This is the greatest evening…" Dielun wanted to ask more, but a girl's voice interrupted his question. That voice was the voice Geoffrey wanted to hear. It was Manli's voice. Manli then ran down the stairs, shouting as she ran! "Where is he? Where is he?"</p>
<p>She stood at the door, as beautiful as a painting. She had already seen Geoffrey, and Geoffrey had already seen her. The two of them looked at each other for a while, as if in a dream, speechless. Later, the two of them met in the center of the hall. Geoffrey hugged her tightly in his arms and kissed her passionately. After a while, Geoffrey pushed Manli away, scrutinizing her, as if somewhat frightened. Manli said, "Geoffrey, darling, you're here, everything is complete, there's nothing wrong…" Geoffrey interrupted, "What do you mean, nothing wrong? Is this a game of hide-and-seek that I have to find myself?" Dielun laughed from the side, "Manli, he doesn't know yet…" Geoffrey… Manli quickly stopped him, saying, "Let me tell him. Geoffrey, I'm going to be Mrs. Dielun Duoda!"</p>
<p>Geoffrey suddenly took a deep breath. In that terrible instant, the world around him seemed to be destroyed, and there were no sun, moon, or stars in the sky. He had come all the way from abroad, originally for Manli. He said for Manli, even if he had to swim back from abroad, he would be willing. But now…" After a while, his senses gradually returned. He forced a smile on his face, but he couldn't speak. Manli kept looking at him, as if searching for something. She said, "Well, aren't you happy? Aren't you congratulating me? Aren't you telling Dielun to take good care of our Nair? Aren't you going to kiss the bride?"</p>
<p>Geoffrey gave a helpless dry laugh, gently pinched Manli's cheek, then turned around and said to Dielun, "Take good care… of… our… Nair…" Everyone laughed. Dielun said loudly, "Our Nair will take care of herself!" Manli grabbed Geoffrey's hand again and said, "You come and give the bride away" (note, this means to be the officiant). Geoffrey nodded slightly. He thought to himself that no matter what, he would never be more heartbroken than he was now. So he said, "Of course, I'll give you away." He paused and added, "Why wouldn't I give you away?" Geoffrey then forced himself to talk to everyone. He also talked privately with Manli for a long time, but he didn't say anything. The taste of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness in his heart soon faded away as everyone dispersed. The unmarried male guests all went to attend the bachelor's dinner.

All will be completed before the major flood this year. Water is currently being released to silt up the fields. The land near Mazhazi has already dried up, revealing 800 mu of fertile fields with an average silt thickness of one meter. In the past, no crops could grow on this land, but now winter wheat has been sown, and the green seedlings are flourishing everywhere. The picture shows the siphon pipe at Mazhazi drawing water from the Yellow River.</p>
