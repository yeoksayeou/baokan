<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日關係改善之關鍵</h3>
<p>———廣田來華説之感想———（常）</p>
<p>近日以來。外電常謂日本對華外交。有力謀改善之意思。如岡田首相將於議會中發表演説。表示對華有謀親善之必要。而廣田外相。亦有來華談判之傳説。後一消息。雖已經滬上報紙加以否認。然空穴來風。不無緣由。我人以爲日本苟有誠意謀修兩國之舊好。則廣田之來。中國自無不願樂與談判之理。蓋國際之間。化敵爲友。事例甚多。不足爲異。所要者卽日本能否改正其過去對我之錯誤耳。</p>
<p>中日二國。同處東亞。誼屬比鄰。人文亦同。照理兩國之關係。應較任何國家爲善。乃事實上適得其反。寗非怪事。然根本原因。實在日本過去對華政策之錯誤。日人往者雖亦高唱同文同種共存共榮之説。然於事實上之行動。則無往不與其辭説相背馳。以此而言親善。則去事實殊遠。我人敢正告日本日。中國固無時不求國際關係之良好與和平。唯他國若言與行違。始終不能認識我國民之眞意。則中國雖欲與之修好。亦有所不能也。故於今日而言中日之親善雖未嘗不可。然欲求其發生實效。端在日本能自知中日關係所以惡化之原因。然後以十二分之决心與誠。意來與我國當局洽。商則中日之親善。庶乎有望乎</p>
<p>往昔歐洲白人。四出侵略。其心理上之動機。卽自視爲超羣絕倫之優秀民族。而。視被侵略者爲劣等民族。實則此種心理狀態。純爲其一種野心之表現事實上學理上民族之優劣。固非如是簡單也。試以日本爲例。往時固亦曾爲歐美所歧視。故上次巴黎和會開會時。日本代表曾有人種平等之要求。爲我黄種人吐氣。此甚値得我人稱許者也。顧輓近以來。歐美人士。對我黄種。人觀感漸異。侵略政策。亦不若往日之烈。不謂日本對於歐美。旣提人種平等之主張。而於其同文同種之民族。反欲施以所謂優秀民族加於所謂劣等民族之手段。何其自相矛盾若是耶。日人又嘗以大亞細亞主義爲言。我人於此。固所樂聞。蓋中山先生生時。亦嘗有此主張也。然欲求大亞細亞主義之實現。必先使亞洲民族。立於平等之地位。不相宰制。不相侵犯。然後始能言親善與合作。若以往日白人所施於異族之政策。轉施於我。則其主張。非吾人所敢知矣。　　故日本眞欲與我親善者。廣田之來。我人未始不表歡迎。唯關鍵則在日本之有無决心與誠意。能否尊重我國家之主權與人民之願望耳。近數日來。歐洲戰禍。烟消雲散。其原因卽在法國對於薩爾之歸德。無可刁難。日本對我之東北。若亦能出此光明之態度。則其餘技節問題。自必迎刃而解。如是則雖不言親善而親善自至也</p>

<p>、稱薩爾民衆無論在何選舉區内已大多、數表示願歸併於德國、因此三人委員會根據民衆之意旨、提出下列建議、（一）薩爾區域應整個併入德國、此係依據凡爾賽和約第四十八欵之規定、及與民衆投票有關之諸條欵者、（二）規定三月一日德國恢復薩薾區域主權、（三）由薩爾委員會會同德法兩國政府及薩爾統治委員會决定政府更易時必需之各項凖備、以及各項義務履行之程序等、如此等凖備在二月十五日尙未同意時、三人委員會應再向國聯行政府院提出建議、俾行政院依據凡爾賽和約條文、及德法雙方所已承認之民衆投票事件各種條欵逕行處理之云、</p>
<h3>法外長之演説</h3>
<p>阿樂西氏報　告畢、法外</p>
<p>長賴伐爾氏卽起立陳述法政府之意旨、稱薩爾投票之結果至爲顯明、民衆之意旨已無可疑義、故薩爾前途之命運、亦已由其民衆自由處理之、國聯行政院在此形勢之下、亦惟有决定薩爾之歸併於德國矣、法國方面亦已預先料及行政院之决定、惟法國素來深信條約神聖不可侵犯之原則、</p>
<p>國聯任務未終了今國聯亦已一再在此種困難形勢下、顯示其努力和平之魄力、故實至可欽佩、惟國聯之任務、今尙未可卽謂告終、在薩爾區域與德國合併之前尙有許多重要問題静待解决、國聯委員會前途尙有一至困難之工作、該委員會應與兩國政府當局及薩爾統治委員會磋商訂立主權移交之條件、以及籌備取消薩爾現在政府之各種方法、此種問題之待解决者多而且繁、惟目前已得之結果、將促成最後之解决云、</p>
<p>仇視痕跡勿稍留賴伐爾氏繼謂、德國元首日昨曾向薩爾民衆致辭、謂彼等應嚴守秩序、使薩爾之復歸德國、在歷史上不留些少汚點云云、按希特勒此言、係表示在投票表决之後、對於遵守條件所賦之特權行使其自由意旨之人民、不再加以仇視或報復之行爲矣、因最後之解决、必不可稍留仇視之痕跡、全世界之人民亦均望其能以莊嚴之態度行之也、</p>
<p>容納移民爲人道至法國之所以不能封鎖其邊境者、係純爲人道起見、將來如對於薩爾移民事發生問題、則國聯應加以公平之處理、</p>
<p>接受希特勒諾言賴伐爾繼又稱德元首希特勒爲歡迎薩爾之歸復、亦曾一再表示其傾向和平之志願、並稱此後對於法國已再無土地之爭云云、余今接受此言、並以事實而言、法德兩國之和洽、實爲歐洲和平最緊要之條件、法國爲酷愛和平之國、但據歷史上所得之敎訓法國亦應有相當之保障、他國亦當然有同樣之權利、故凡在國際間訂立條約互相保障之時、應不稍遲疑而加入合作云、</p>
<h3>英俄代表致詞</h3>
<p>賴伐爾致詞　畢、英掌壐大臣艾登及蘇聯外委李維諾夫等均相繼起立致詞、均謂薩爾問題圓滿解决、實可證明雙方國家之榮譽、及國聯存在之立塲云、國聯行政院於是卽一致通過三人委員會之建議、然後由主席魯希悌起立致謝詞、宜佈散會、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法意兩國關於交讓薩爾、巴成立妥恊、而定三月一日歸德國管埋、此項恊定旋經國聯行政院通過、於是人心爲之大慰、恊定中載明凡爾賽和約第四十一與四十二兩欵關於萊因倫撤除軍備者、將施於薩爾、倘現有之財政問題、如官員之權利與社會保險種種、未經解决、則國聯行政院將於二月十五日集議接收之、而覓取解决方法、英代表艾登在行政院會議演説歡迎此項恊定、謂渠希望此恊定一經通過、將有助於國際諒解、此恊定旣尊重雙方、復尊重國聯云、法外長賴伐爾聲稱、法國已預先接受公民大會投票之結果、渠信希特勒所作不得使不名譽擊連於交還薩爾之言、其意以爲不得有報復行爲也、法國爲人道起見、不拒絕收容薩爾之出亡者、但此輩出亡者將成國際問題、法國擬向行政院提出此事、希特勒曾謂一月十三者已取趨向法德親善之堅决步驟云、要知今無一國政府得拒絕參加志在使簽約國獲自已所必需的相互擔保之公約成立、賴氏末言曰、「吾人當力求善用最近在羅馬成立之恊定」（路透</p>
<h3>法德妥恊大綱</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）薩爾問題三人委員會、經長時間之討論、並與柏林方面電話接洽後、頃已成立法德兩國間關於薩爾問題之妥恊、其大綱如下、</p>
<p>（一）國聯會行政院就凡爾賽條約所產生之條件、决定薩爾區域重行歸併德國、因此凡爾賽條約中撤廢軍備之條欵、在薩爾區域亦一律適用、</p>
<p>（二）規定德國於本年三月一日起、收回薩爾區域之領土、</p>
<p>（三）關於薩爾區域各項懸案連同在柏林巴黎舉行之商務談判在内、如於二月十五日以前完全解决、則國聯會當根據薩爾問題三人委員會之報告、予以備案、倘至二月十五日各項懸案尙未完全解决、則應由三人委員會向行政院提出建議、届時行政院應召集特别會議、以採取必要决定、</p>
<p>按此次關於薩爾問題之妥恊、拖延時日、其主要困難蓋有二點、一則爲薩爾區域撤廢軍備問題、一則爲國聯會行政院對於有關法國利益各項問題之仲裁權、德國主張限制國聯會行政院决定之範圍、僅以關於薩爾成立新政制一事爲限、而法國方面則要求凡過去一切懸案、如私人債務問題等、行政院均有權加以清理、以上兩項困難、其第一項如關於警察及設立飛機塲等問題、在原則上已成立妥恊、其第二項現亦成立妥恊、因此今晚行政院會議中、可不再有困難、而可安然通過關於薩爾問題之决議案矣、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希特勒宣言德願致力和平</h3>
<p>重中對法今後無領土爭執</p>
<p>平等爲重返國聯唯一條件</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國元首希特勒今日與倫敦每日郵報特派員普萊斯談話、曾爲德國致力和平作切實之聲明、談話地點在慕尼里、希氏所言計有下列各點、第一、德國本身决不破壞和平、第二、如他人侵犯德國、則不啻自投羅綱、謂「吾人茲已自動向法國保證、薩爾問題解决之後、吾人卽無其他領土之爭、同時予亦敢言、吾人决不爲威武所屈、而犧牲吾人在國際間之平等權利」、善氏詢以德國將在何種條件下始能重返國聯、希氏之答語頗爲憤慨、其言曰、「德國無論何人皆人願以重返國聯一事、取决於任何條件、蓋此事所待解决者唯有一事、卽德國是否能以完全平等之資格再行參加而已」、希氏並稱、德國絕無挑戰以謀自利之意、並稱、「若他國之利益於德國毫無關係者、吾人更不願代爲訴諸武力」云云、（十八日國民電）</p>

<h3>第三德國政治地位鞏固</h3>
<p>對奥無所表示</p>
<p>意報深爲失望</p>
<p>（羅馬）　自薩爾公民投票德國勝利之後、第三德國政治地位爲之鞏固、但德國宫方旣無正式宣言、亦未發表評論、確切保證德國在薩爾投票旣已獲得勝利、則異日對歐洲其他部分、卽不復有所企圖、尤其對於奥國、更不宜有所覬觎、又關於德國回返國聯會之可能性、亦毫無表示、因此意大利報紙頗爲失望、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）薩爾區域社會黨領袖樸朗、本爲主張維持現狀最力之一人、自薩爾投票决定歸還德國後、樸氏爲安全起見、卽避居法境、頃據報告、檨氏將在某處集會中發表演説、力主各種法西斯團體應予以解散云云、巴黎市參議會某議員聞訊、常卽聲請警察廳長通知樸氏、謂其寄居法境備受𥜚容、應以客禮自持、不可作此種言論云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>紐喀斯爾　麥唐納首相今日在此間演説、力主早日穩定國際匯兑、稱吾人如不能解决國際匯兑問題、則吾入永不能圓滿解决其他問題、蓋國際匯兑問題無日不遇也云、最近美元漲落不定、謠傅美國將恢復金本位、並稱美元及金鎊之穩定已在目前、首相適於此時發表演説、故尤堪注意云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　麥唐納首相頃在紐凱塞爾扶輪社發表演説、對於現内閣所採之方式及事業、加以辯護、謂内閣内政外交、達到完全勝利、當在國際局勢更見清明之時、歐洲和平意志之宣揚、民族輕互信任之推廣、英國内閣實爲一有力之要素、述及經濟方面、則爲關税保護政策不當拘泥程式、而應信守健全經濟之原則、國家干涉政策行之過度、則不免發生流弊、殊爲不當云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）近來工黨方面迭傅國會總選舉、將於本年年内舉行、外國方面亦有此項傳説、頃首相麥唐納宣稱、「外國方面謠、傳政府、因某種原因、擬將國會總選舉提前舉行云云、實則此種傳説全出臆造、予爲政府首領、故願使國内國外人士盡知此中眞相、吾人之取得政權、乃在改善人民之命運、吾人所有之時間、雖一分鐘亦必利用之、以期逐步達到目的」云云、（十六日瓦斯電（</p>

<p>工業　蘇氏詳論蘇聯工業之進步、謂蘇聯工廠已能自製機件、重工業全部已完成其全年產量計劃、卽於改進質量之計劃亦將告成、蓋質量一點乃蘇機歷年工業最弱之點、</p>
<p>農業　蘇氏旋論農業、指明蘇俄於一九三四年十月份集體化程度爲百分之七三·二、現時此項百分數必增高甚多、因近數月來個别農民之加入集體農塲者最多、如在西部省内近三月内已有五千九百個農塲加入集體農塲、列寗格拉省加入者二千四百個、巴希吉利亞有六千五百個、第二届五年計劃終了時、（一九三七年）、集體化工作將全部告終、「予意吾人如謂此項工作必能提早完成、必無大誤也、」蘇氏復稱國内畜牧業亦能改進、各類牲畜均有增加、蘇氏詳述集體農塲在經濟及組織上之加强、並謂因集體農塲工作之改進、故一九三四年春季播種較早於前年、收割及繳納榖物工作均較優並較快於前年、本年各州各省、集體農耕必能繼續改進、故集體農民之物質條件亦能上升、蘇氏復列舉數字、明集體農民物質與文化生活提證高、　　敎育　蘇氏復論文化及社會工作之偉大成功、謂蘇俄不僅實施强進初等敎育、且欲將普及敎育提高至中等敎育程度、全國初中學學生現有一千七百二十萬、而革命以前僅約六百萬、成人中文盲所佔成份一九三一年爲百分之三十五、今日則爲百分之八、市政經濟及房屋建築方面之投資共達六十五萬萬盧布、各城市新添住房一千九百餘萬立方公尺、</p>

<p>國際　蘇氏結論中論及國際局面、氏謂、「過去時期内、蘇聯在國際上之力量大有增加、同時各國承認蘇聯對於和平及全世界國際關係、實爲萬分重要之因子、謂無蘇聯參加、國際重要問題均無從解决、在此期内、吾國勞動大衆均以異常之注意、注視吾東部邊境、蓋該地和平成因已屢經摧挫、蘇聯恒以其堅定不移之和平政策和平解决各項爭端、蘇氏復稱、（其時聽衆掌聲如雷）」予意吾東方鄰國必能洞悉、吾人對於此類複雜爭端如此解决、絕非出於蘇聯之積弱、而爲蘇聯堅决企求和平之表現、吾國在東方邊境所以得安静如常者、一面固由蘇聯外交政策此後仍能堅决爲和平而奮鬥、一如往昔、同時更因吾國已凖備（予當力言如此）於任何時期擊退不論來自何方之襲擊也、吾意本届大會必將訓令政府此後仍應厲行和平政策、而以此作爲外交政策之基點、努力與各國建立正常邦交、並保證各種方法以加强吾國國防能力」云、（十七日塔斯電）</p>

<p>但是、在戰時如遇燃燒彈落下的候、務須立即使用砂土掩壓撲滅之、阻止其延燒、若已延燒而及於他物時、就應即用消火器具、或水桶灌水撲滅之、雖隣居巷内的居民、亦須立時聚集、互相恊力施救、此外如官署·學校·工廠·及各大公司、應須常備消防器具、將職員·職工·學生·編成消防隊、預爲訓練、那末、有了戰時的準備、如遇平時的災害發生、也就更可收得消防的效益了、</p>
<p>以上專就消防一項來説、市民所負的責任、是這樣的緊要、而在空襲時、所有防毒·救護·工務·警備·交通整理、警報傅達、等等的勤務、也是須要以市民担任爲主、因爲遣是與市民關係最切的事務、如果市民不自動的來担任、雖有政府來領導、也是不容易收到週密而廣遍的效果、所以市民與防空的關係、確是至爲密切、防空的任務、也確是全在於市民、</p>
<p>最近、我們的政府當局、感着國難頻仍、危機四迫、强鄰的野心、方興未艾、一朝有事、我們的重要城市、必將頃刻間遭其空襲、而化爲灰燼、因此、用于去年十一月間、在首都舉行初次的防空大演習、這在全國的防空設施上、可説是有了一個創導、因爲這次的防空演習、不僅是給予南京市民對於防空有了極深刻的認識、同時全國的民衆、亦因此對於防空的需要、也有相當的感覺、不遇、我們旣然對於防空有了相當的認識知道是一個迫切嚴重的問題、我們就應當要積極的去研究、努力的去設施、雖然我國是財力缺乏、事事落後、應有的國防建設、都不是一時可能辦到的、但只要我們全體的同砲、能够抱定苦硬幹的决心、也就不難迎頭趕上去、以與列强併駕的、（完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廳盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>在程志前這方面，很知道張李二人，都是俗不可耐的鏆官蟲，但是人家客客氣氣的前夾打招呼、决不好意思置之不理。所以張介夫帶着那諂笑的態度來，却也只好含了笑容，請他坐下。然而他是有他的作法的、於是伸手到懷裏去摸索了一陣。摸出一個藍布小包捲來，透開了包捲、裏面又是白手絹包子，再打開白手絹包來，有一張紅紙托子，上面托住了兩件玉器。一件是緣了半環的指環，一件是雕刻精細的小玉馬，程志前却有點愕然，莫非他兼作玉器生意，前來拉攏買賣的不成？張介夫却是笑嘻嘻的，將兩隻手托住了那紅紙托子。送到程志前面前，笑道：這點東西，不成敬意，程志前更呆住了，彼此毫無交誼，爲什麽要他送這樣貴重的禮品？這如何敢接他的？連連的搖着手道：不敢當，不敢當，怎好受這樣的重惠。張介夫將玉放在桌上，拱了兩拱手道：我也知道程先生是不肯賞光的。但是我若是説明了，程先生就可以賞收了，我有一個同鄉，在西安城裏，作販賣骨董生意，我今天去看他，他就隨意的送了我這兩件東西，他送我的東西，也不是毫無意思的。意思以爲我認識政界的人多、有到西安來買骨董的。託我介紹一二，我想他把這東西送給我那是白糟塌了。而且總也要値三四十塊錢。我實在不便用。程先生是個交際廣闊的人，有道是寳劍贈與烈士，我就送給程先生了。（一一六）</p>
<h3>偉人的相</h3>
<p>— （田舍翁）</p>
<p>讀了本　江鳥君的「四異相」，説海上聞人，皆有異相：咱因此想起　黨國偉人的相來了，略述數人如左：（一）書生相　國府行政院長汪精衛先生，誰都知道是革命先進，也是當代的大政治家，他現在五十多歲人了瞧上去，恂恂儒者，不過四十歲左右的模樣：這和胡漢民先生一樣，都是彬彬有君子風的白面書生，那裏看得出是革命偉人呢。史稱張子房貎若婦人女子、可知不是愆言了。</p>
<p>（二）菩薩相　考試院院長戴季陶先生，從前我讀他在天鐸報，民權報上的論文，，排奡犀利，想見其爲人，自從皈依我佛以來，莊嚴慈悲，溢于眉宇，眞和海上的王一亭。王曉籟，狄平子諸先生，現了「如來妙相」咧，。</p>
<p>（三）神仙相　行政院秘書長褚民誼先生，魁梧奇偉。精太極拳。很像八仙中人，這也許是學養變化氣質跟面相的緣故吧。</p>
<p>（四）老太婆相　自號大觀圍内劉老老的中委吴穉暉先生，上了年紀，　着嘴吧，倒很有些「老太婆相。」但，吴老先生，嘴雖　着，舌如蓮花，他老人家不開口則已，一開口，却十二分幽默。深刻，眞不愧爲劉老老呀。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （蕉心）</p>
<p>西施在歷史上是我國美人的典型伊的故鄉是浙江諸暨的苧蘿村、據説該村到現在每年仍舊有一個絕頂艷麗的女子產生，然而總是不幸，没有幾歲便夭折了。</p>
<p>鄭板橋日：「吾輩讀書人。一捧」書本，便想作官，如何攫取金錢，造大房屋，置多田產；起乎便走了錯路，後來越做越壞，總没有個好結果。銷；但是世間讀書人，有幾個不踏此覆轍的？</p>
<h3>衰落的手工業</h3>
<p>— （陳亮）</p>
<p>從幾個做手藝的同鄉口中，得悉最</p>
<p>近手工業衰落的情形，雖還幸未失業，也祇好混口飯吃，生活是困苦極了，短衫褲穿成醬油色。剪頭洗浴的錢都没有，現在約略寫幾個人的説話在下面，亦是嚴重的社會問題吧。</p>
<p>一個做裁縫的説：「人家都以爲衣服總省不了的，話雖不錯，可是這年頭兒市面不好，錢不容易掙，普通人家日常開支，那一椿不在打着緊縮的算盤、譬如。式樣舊的翻一翻，大的改小，皮的換個面子亦就算了，新衣服能省便省，這一來，我們做裁縫的就没有了出息，作檯板上冷清清地，裁縫司務　着眉頭在打五關，你想，還弄得好嗎！」</p>
<p>一個做書套的説：「唸書朋友都知道的吧，眼前甚麽書本兒統改了精裝洋裝本了，前些時，還有一部份線裝書用書套，現在可也受了書店競爭傾銷的影響，把許多古書舊小説翻版成爲單本，貼了洋紙封面，認書套是落伍多餘的東西了。做書套的人，亦因之而被剝奪了飯碗。」</p>
<p>一個做紅木的説：「我們是靠手勁兒吃飯的，只要拉得動一天鋸，就不愁肚子餓，可是，眼前的一輩子都講求洋派了，用西式木器，闊綽一些的更不用説從拉水馬桶到克羅蜜牀牀，而且，小件又不通洋莊了，如今有了氣力没活兒幹，活該是我們的絕路嗎！」</p>
<p>還有磨溙的，做銅匠的········也寫不了許多，總之，都市裏一部份有購買能力的，崇歐化，日常所需，均爲舶來品，連如厠用的草紙，亦不是國產了。至於内地，本來所有的衣着用具，尙要送到當舖裏去押錢，還有什麽購買能力可以説呢？以上所造成的結果，是，中國民族工業日趨没落，而手工業便隨在機製工業後面崩潰了。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這又是一節極難得到的專門學識，我們聽了，都覺得很有趣味無數的視綫，齊集中在那匹久積塵垢，今天才草草地打掃過的森馬的身上，而太后是格外的揚揚自得了。</p>
<p>把從前人這種艱苦勇武的生活，和現在的皇宮中的生活來互相比較、眞不知道要有多少的差别！幾乎使我們不能相信從前的滿洲的統治者眞能這樣的耐苦奮鬥！其實倒是一些不假的！不但領袖的人如此，凡宮内所有的一切皇親國戚，大臣近侍，可説是没一個不天天在這種生活中鍜鍊磨勵着的：到此刻，幾百年的奢侈的中土生活，已完全把我們軟化了。</p>
<p>其時，我們已把這三間不小小的宮殿全參觀到了。便仍由太后領導着，走到了外面的廣塲上去，這一片廣塲上，在從前差不多是天天有人在這裏憑着他的胆氣和勇力、跟那些爪犀利的野獸們性命相搏，現在呢，已變爲一片全無用處的荒地了，可是塲的西邊的一帶森林，却是鬱鬱蒼蒼的更茂盛了，高大的樹影，在地上晃動着，險些使我們懷疑裏面將有什麽野獸衝出來了，太后抬着頭，往四面隨意眺望了一回，彷彿很感慨地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>當我們决定要上這裏來之前，太后曾在盛京的宮院中説過一段關於這一日的紀念史的大略，而且還允許我們在見到了這裏的一座森林以後，再把詳細的情形告訴我們：現在。我們是已經到了這座森林前面來了，于是伊的預約也實踐了！（二二六）</p>
<h3>骷髏之瘋狂舞</h3>
<h3>口味</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>食物有各種不同的滋味，辨别這滋味就全靠着口。</p>
<p>口能嘗出甚麽是甜，甚麽是䶢，甚麽是酸，甚麽是苦，甚麽是辣。</p>
<p>人們的口味也各有不同。大部分算起來：歡喜吃甜的要佔最多數，其次，則是歡喜吃䶢的：再次則是歡喜吃的和吃辣的，至於歡喜吃苦的，那説是絕無僅有的了。</p>
<p>我的二哥很愛吃酸，每次吃麵的時候他總是嚷着湯味太䶢，有一次家裏人故意給他的麵湯裏只放些醋，等他吃完了，問他湯味怎樣？他説：「今天的湯味很好，只是鹽少了些。」其實他不知道湯裏根本就没有放鹽呢！這也是關於口味的笑話喲。</p>
<p>一個廚子要想得到主人的歡心。似乎先要知道主人的口味，但這樣却不能算是良好的廚手，眞正良好的廚子，是要能燒出美味的菜肴，使得吃的人都能遷就他和口味。</p>
<p>所以我們要求一切的廚手、都能燒出標準的使人就範地美肴：同時更期望一般吃的人們、都有標凖的辨味地舌頭。</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>夜訪天寗寺</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>中國佛敎之盛，由來甚久，各地故多叢林古刹，早已著名於世，單就天寗寺而論，已有四處，北平藃寗間外是、處，江都天寗門外是一處、廣東海康縣西關外又是一處、而我所説的却在常州城東門外唐朝啓建的那一所。</p>
<p>旅行到常州，正是初冬無雪的陰天，走進火車站、看遠處城心，已滿綴着明潔的燈火、夜風吹得非常之勁，喚一輛人力車，獨個兒進城，打算去痛喝一次蘭陸名酒、狠呑一次薄皮鮮潔的花猪肉，因爲自家還初次拜訪、讓車夫拖到那裏便是那鄽、對於經過的市街名稱、可以説完全茫然；但依據這商業在晚上不甚發皇的市容看來、也還與宜興的歸城相似。</p>
<p>車子在小浮橋被停下來。好在燈火正燒旺了夜市；踅向橋西、在縣直街瞥見了德順菜館、肚子正餓得慌，便上樓去修理五臟廟」。不用説酒味是及不到紹興的東浦興阮社，當初李太白的「蘭陵美酒鬱金香」、只是偶然的狂語；倒是東坡肥肉、比湖北黄州的不輸若干、我尤其愛吃那色香味俱美的糖浸芹菜！</p>
<p>醉飽下樓，一想天寗寺裏正住着餐病的朋友，與其花錢向騷閙逆旅中度這悠寂的寒宵，不如去古寺裏找他談的好，而况順便也得探聽探聽他最近的健康，所以用電話通知寺裏，請他們不要把山門早早的關上。</p>
<p>依舊坐上街車、在夜凉如水的月明裏、看看冷静下來的大街小巷，看看變幻的幾點星辰，有着一些征途孤寂的悲感。託福車夫的腕力，給我拉向東直街去。聽城上打更的鑼聲，慢慢兒輕了遠了。</p>
<p>轉轉戀戀，不知奔了多少路。爲了疲勞，只閉着眼抽長自已的思緒。雖然冷風容易吹醒淺醉。但自已浸沈在更深的夢幻裏。竟糢糊得忘記了看那夜色中的建築物。</p>
<p>倒是車出城東門，在油燈的黄暗光氛裏，約略辨出有三五個逃荒的乞兒。枯坐在稻草上打盹，於是我就完成了一首五律：「窮醉尋歸宿，孤跡偶訪禪。霜衣披午月，風絮逼丁年！客路聞饑鳥，豪門沸管絃。傷時吾輩事，無計問聾天」。打算停一回誦給抱病的好友。看他怎麽批評。</p>
<p>幾乎走盡東直街，東夫突然發問，聲音帶着急喘；</p>
<p>「先生，是不是一直拉進天寗寺呢？」</p>
<p>這一來、把我正在玩味詩句的沉思剪斷了。</p>
<p>睜開眼一瞧，左面便是一座灰色的女牆，中央開了一個彎圓形的門洞，月光正滿流在洞内的廣塲上，有着高大的緣樹，散植凉蔭，一簇一簇的眠着。當我對車夫把乎指向山門一揮的瞬間，車輛就急遽地滾進去了。</p>
<p>不知是車上鈴聲的緣故呢，還是宿鳥偶然的夜啼：倒警動了一匹酣睡的黄狗，它就跳起來狂暴地亂吠。在静寂之夜，眞是容易騷擾那候門的山僧的。</p>
<p>這時，天上正有一片凍雲飛過，暫把月兒掩没；空院裏惟有沉沉的暗黑，樹葉在風中歌嘯，趁着犬吠，情景眞是動人。眼看劈面山門裏。隱約地透出一點小小的紅燈，似乎在移動，移得很快，好像　夜海中的塔燈；但燈光越移越近。也越近越大，漸漸瞧出提燈人的面貎，那還不是個戴着高　　的和尙？我馬上跳上車，付了車錢，慌忙奔向紅燈就樹邊。感激地説：</p>
<p>「師父，勞神了！要你久等。」</p>
<p>「不要緊！先生不是從城裏來？」和尙站定了反問我。（未完）</p>

<h3>濾波電容器的耐壓問題</h3>
<p>— （李元慶）</p>
<p>新近和朋友修了幾只式樣不同的交流收音機丨丨丨有的是購置現成的，有的是自行裝配的，可是發現的弊病，却完全一樣丨丨丨都是濾波電空器（FilrerCondenser(因過載而短路，這不是一件很奇怪的事情麽？</p>
<p>商品化的收音機，因爲要力求地位嬌小和售價低廉的緣故，不得不儘量减少各零件的體積和數量，因此，其濾波電容器之不能耐用，事屬當然。但是自製的收音機，却又爲什麽也犯着同樣的弊病呢？那便令人有些不解了！</p>
<p>據我猜想，大概還有許多人對於濾波電容器的耐壓問題，還没有相當的認識吧！</p>
<p>我們知道，凡是電容器，都有一定的耐壓度，（VoItagerating）且如果超過了這規定的電壓，便足以影響牠的壽命，這是確切不移的事實。</p>
<p>通常電容器上所標明耐壓的數目，是代表直流電壓而不是交流電壓。不信，你試將一個標明能耐壓五百弗打的電容器接在五百弗打的交流電路内、保險不久便有短路之虞！</p>
<p>要解釋上述特殊的現象，便不能不先從交流電壓的本身談起。</p>
<p>所谓交流電壓，並不像直流電壓那樣簡單。嚴格的説起來如果我們單説「交流電壓」四個字，那是毫無意義的，必須要説明何種交流電壓纔行。</p>
<p>原來交流電壓的本身，是一種正弦波動式(SinewaveForm)的。（見附圖）牠的數値。隨時隨刻變動着，並不一定。人們爲使用便利起見，便把牠分成下述三種數値：</p>
<p>（一）有效交流電壓　交流電壓，隨時變動，已如上述，這樣，我們不是很難得到一個確定的數値麽，科學家爲解决此項困難起見、第一步便指定：交流電壓能產生與直流電壓同樣功用的數値，便呌做有效流電壓，（ＥffectiveＶalueofA.CVojtage)通常所謂交流電壓或是交流電壓表内所測到的數値，都是屬於這一種。其數値約爲最大交流電壓的，七０七倍。</p>
<p>（二）最大交流電壓　所謂最大交流電壓，（MaximumVaiueofA,CVoltage)便是交流電壓在最高峯的數値，所以又呌做峯壓，（PeadVoltage）其數値約爲有效値之一·四一倍。</p>
<p>（三）平均交流電壓　這裏所説的平均交流電壓，（AverageValueofA.C.Voltage)並不是交流電壓在一循環（CYc</p>
<p>le)内的平均値，（一循環之平均値恰爲零）乃是指半循環而説的，（如圖C至D及F至G卽是）其數値約爲有效値之·九倍。</p>
<p>交流電壓表内所測到的數値，是有效値，而不是最大値，已見上述。實際上在每一循環内，仍能碰見最大値二次。所以我們在交流電路内，使用電容器或其他任何零件，必須要能够耐住最大値纔行。換句話説：至少須要能够耐得住有效値的一·四一倍，纔能適用。</p>
<p>這樣看來。可知以五百弗打的電容器，接在交流電路内。實際上牠受到的電壓。最大時有500*1.41=705弗打之多丨丨丨超越牠規定的耐壓度，幾有半倍之勢，又怎能没有危險呢？</p>
<p>例如某收音機的輸出管爲丨丨45,當屏壓爲275弗打時，丙電壓約爲五十六弗打，再假定低週率阻流綫圈内的電壓降爲四十弗打，那麽，濾波電容器所受到的有效電壓，已達三百七十一弗打，其最大値爲375X1.41=523.11弗打。在此種狀態之下，如果再貿然接上五百弗打的電容器、其不能耐用，自在意料之中。</p>
<p>有時外來電壓過高，或變壓器因發熱而使波形失眞（ＷaveＤislortiun）時。其最大値往往會超出有效値之一·四一倍。所以在交流電路内。應用的各種絕緣物，通常爲求安全起見，總以能耐有效値之一·五倍爲標準。因此，上述的電容器，應採用能耐371X1.5=55615弗打的纔好，可選擇與此數最近，能耐壓七百弗打者用之，（注意：通常電容器上所標明的耐壓度，係商品之廣告語，事實上至少也須打個八九折纔行，所以選用七百弗打的電容器，並不算多，</p>
<p>還有電空器遇到熱度，也會影響到牠的耐壓數目，所以電容器在收音機内所安放的地位，以能遠離電源變壓器以及眞空管等發熱部份爲妙。這一點也得附帶説明的。</p>
<h3>强力交流機改接聽筒</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>自强力交流收音機盛行以來、聽筒似已成爲過去時代的遺物、先之置備者，今都棄之如廢物，其實在許多情形之下，我們時常覺得聽筒的需要，例如深夜收聽音樂時，用揚聲器放音，勢必擾人清夢，自不若改接聽筒爲聒静，喜玩短波的同志，若以揚聲器接收遠距離電台音樂，往往因訊號徵弱，一無所獲，如能改接聽筒，不難得意外的收獲，家中設有年老或聽學有缺憾者，他人認爲調節至適度音量時，彼尙不能辦别。自最好分接一聽筒，使其亦能享樂。</p>
<p>本篇所述二種最簡單的方法。可使聽筒適用於任何收音機，第一法，在收音機末級輸出管的屏極上，添一接綫、Ａ一接壳圖　經斷路電容器Ｃ接至一單路聽筒插口一之端，其另一端接收音機壳，如圖一Ａ，插口可裝置在收音機木箱側面，設或輸出級係用兩個眞空管，接成推挽式者。插口之二端，須各經一斷路電容器，連接於兩眞空管的屏極，如圖一Ｂ。</p>
<p>使用時，祇須將聽筒插頭插入插口内。卽可收聽，至於收音機的調整手續，仍與平時一樣，如爲接收遠地電台，僅需聽筒内發音，可在揚聲器的音圈接綫内。添接一開關關斷之，如專爲聽覺不便者而添接聽筒，可將開關關開啟，揚聲器同時放音·</p>
<p>第一法音量之調節。須在收音機原二固　有的音量控制器上調節之，聽筒内之音量，不能單獨調節，殊爲不便，故有第二法之補救，卽聽筒不直接插入收音機之插口内，而另以一音量控制器代之，如固二，ab兩端可接收音機上的插口，以聽筒插入J2内調節Ｒ，使聽筒内音量適合其個人的需要。</p>
<h3>放大週率區别</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>不論是一架收音機抑是一架放大機，欲使牠有充分音量的輸出，則勢必有相當放大的裝置，普通放大計分高週率放大(RadioFrepuencyAmplifier)中間週率放大（intermediateFrequency）</p>
<p>Ampjilier)及低週率放大大）ＡudioＦrepu</p>
<p>encyAmelifier）等三種高週率放大係放大由播音台射出的高週率電浪，經該眞管放大後而輸出的，依舊爲高週率電浪，其原理則不過是加强外來電訊使檢波级易於接收罷了。</p>
<p>中間週率放大者多數皆使用外差式或超等外差式收音機中，所謂中間週率者是已經過一番相當檢波而成的。該項檢波謂之第一級檢波，雖然高週率電浪已經檢波了，可是牠所檢收的訊號人耳依舊不能聽聞的，故在此間加以放大日中間週率放大。並加以調正在兩綫圈互感間，再經第二級檢波方始成爲成音低週率，因該項方式調正部份多、故選擇性極爲優良，</p>
<p>低週率放大者是放大已經檢波的成音低週率電浪，該項放大成效較前兩法爲大，只不過不能加以調節部份，選擇性當然較前法爲遜。倘加以多級低週率放大，則音調勢必失眞，故在舶來品收音機中低週率放大至多是只採用一級的。</p>
<h3>最新音調控制法</h3>
<p>— （李元慶）</p>
<p>通常控制音調的方法，大概是在低週率放大綫路内，（初級或次級）並接上一個固定電容器，和一個變量電阻器。使用時。减低電阻便能將週率較高的音調割脱，（Ｃut）結果，揚聲器内發内的聲音。便能十分沉悶。（請參閲本刊第十六期拙作（「音調控制法」）</p>
<p>「音調控制」（ＴoneＣontrol）顧名思義。便應當能够隨意控制音調的高抵纔行，可是上述的音調控制器。却祇能將高音删掉，充分放出低音。而不能將低音减少，儘量發出高音。這是牠的缺點！</p>
<p>西樂音調高亢，樂器衆多，每當二三十人合奏時，其聲隆隆，噪音極多。所以必須要删除高音節的聲浪後。纔能悦耳動聽，中樂便不這樣，譬如：一個旦角隨着京胡唱戲，平時已嫌單調，如果再加上上述的音調控制器，那麽，聽的人便要以爲拉的是把破胡琴，喝的是個嗡鼻子呢，這是中西音樂組織和中西人士聽覺不同的地方。不可使之强合的。</p>
<p>最近在英國業餘無綫電)AmateurWireiess）雜誌内看到一篇新式的音調控制器。却能補救上述的缺點特爲扼要迻譯於左。以供同好。</p>
<p>如圖，Ｌ爲》３至。４bv之阻流綫圈。Ｃ爲o.imf之固定電容器。Ｒ爲１００００歐姆之電位表，（均並接於低週率變壓器初級綫圈内，如附圖虚綫内所示。）當電位表Ｒ停止在中心點時，本器無甚作用，此時揚聲器内放出之音調。高低適中。Ｒ旋向右方時，週率較高之音節，均從Ｃ處溜去，發出之聲調，便非常沉悶。Ｒ旋向左方時，週率較低之音節，均從Ｌ處脱逃，發出之聲調，便能極有生</p>
<h3>增加選擇性又一法</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>在電台林立的上海，選擇性這個問題，確實是難以解决的，除有多級高週率調正以及超等外差式收音機選擇性較好外，普通綫路收音機選擇性，尤爲惡劣甚至有四五家混在一起的，上項弊病除减短天綫，减少初級綫圈，以及調節天綫回路，外似乎已别無他法，現在作者來介紹增加選擇性的極好方法，想爲讀者所歡迎的吧！</p>
<p>綫路見圖Ｌ爲初級回路綫圈，Ｌ爲再生式再生綫圈，Ｌ２爲局外調正綫圈，Ｌ３爲柵回路綫圈（卽次級回路綫圈，）照該圖設計選擇性極爲優良，綫圈可用念六號絲包繞在蛛綱板上，Ｌ須較普通者多繞些，Ｌ１則須視眞空管特性爲定，Ｌ２，Ｌ３各繞六十五圈，照圖次序排例，其間距離可試騐適當後而固定之，Ｃ，Ｃ，皆係０·０００三五ＭＦ變量電容器。</p>

<h3>電源方棚鐵片振動聲的免除法</h3>
<p>— （周文煥）</p>
<p>電源方棚，在交流收音機中，佔着重要的地位，（現今雖有不用的，但仍屬少數）他工作的優劣，（即不發熱，没有振動聲等）對於該機發音的成績，有極大的關係，作者新近替一個朋友，修理好一只機器，他的毛病，就是此刻所要告訴給諸位的。那只機器，係自已購置另件，裝配成的，綫路爲一架三管强力交流機，電源方棚，亦係自製，音量及選擇性，尙都不差，所最可惡的，即交流聲甚蠁，但查他的内部，能設法免除交流聲的地方，都已改過，没有辦法，交我來修理，得到乎之後，即行着乎檢查，發現方棚鐵心外。邊西週的鐵片，略有振動，用手一壓，交流聲即輕、那時我就確定他，一定在這個東西裏作怪，怎樣去醫治他的呢？方法是很簡單、只用白蜡液，即洋蜡燭之類）燒鎔注入鐵片的孔隙中。一俟冷却，接上電源，那可惡的交流聲，竟是一些没有。讀者中，若有同病的，不妨請你也來一試。上述的白蜡液中，若能加入十分之三的蜂蜡，萬一方棚發熱起來，不致即失效用。</p>

<h3>棉花抵空甚殷</h3>
<p>棉市趨好、因本月份交貨缺乏、棉花檢騐處至今日止審查及格者、火機花七百担、山蚽粗絨花一千担、共計約一千七百担之譜、因此浮空視交貨不踴、而活動抵補、同時美棉遠月漲氣尤烈、市價乃更昂矣、印棉白洛區暗盤猛漲七羅比、</p>
<p>本月交貨不足　標花前市開盤、因疲弱數目之美棉、今則突然轉漲、而遠月漲風益熾、印棉粗貨跌、細貨漲、同時本月份收貨雖不多、然空方交貨太少、成交數尙剩八萬餘担、散空鑒於交貨籌碼不充足、祇得活動抵補、因之市盤愈昂、但大户空頭仍安然不補、各月均漲一二角、午後開盤、聞印棉暗盤又飛漲五羅比二五、市情尙好、但拍至三收盤、有一部份獲利者了結、本月未動、遠跌五分、查賣出源大一千担、通記一千五百担、大孚二千三百担、賡豐一千五百担、生源一千二百担、益康一千担、愼記一千三百担、元一一千二百担、長豐一千担、買進大豐二千五百担、長豐二千六百担、新亨二千八百担、源興昌一千七百担、一日間最高代價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>美棉消息利於多頭</h3>
<p>產額定一千零五十萬包</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、同業及外商買進、各月漲四至七磅音、旋以多頭了結而回、農部總長宣言以後、市價鋭昂、惟以金條文案之不定、又有大批賣出、終以本地及紐奥崙之買進、動行上漲、有人以欲保護政府貸欵们陳棉、來年新棉亦必舉行新貸欵、及維持手續税、收盤堅定、計現貨漲十五磅音、近期漲十二三磅音、遠月漲二十五至二十八磅音、英棉市况平穩、計現貨漲五點、期貨漲跌一黠、印棉空户抵補吸收多方了結、計平果爾跌二角半、奥姆辣漲三羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（十七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食期粉壓迫重重</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、一致傾跌、洋麥報價、芝加哥漲一二角左右、坎拿大漲一角左右、當開價時、以洋麥報好、業内外人心人、多趨觀望、近遠期開價、均少出入、惟至二盤以後、因本月份客帮無甚抽裝、遠期則廠抛接續、壓迫重重故市况又轉跌勢、較初開時跌二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份開價、又見不佳、曾一度四角破進、低至三角九分、惟拍至遠期、因業外多頭買進、浮空亦有抵補、故市氣曾一度回昂一二分、至收盤交易仍暢、雙方摜住、以供求相稱、市價逾平、惟業中人則因洋麥之續定不已、定均看軟弱也、結果本月份跌三分七厘半、二月份跌二分半、三月份跌三分二厘半、四月份跌二分七厘半、五月份跌二分半、六月份跌一分七厘半、</p>
<h3>小麥先定繼跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈先定繼則瀉跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回漲一二角左右、當開價時、以洋麥報好、市氣平穩、惟至二盤以後、因紛市步落、且市塲仍有洋麥套貨、故市氣即逆轉、人心頓虚也、迨至下午開盤、本月份因結賬伊邇、有現貨預備交割者、頗不乏人、故市氣更形鬆濫、遠期以賣氣亦盛、亦見跟落、觀目下情形、因此洋麥鬆廉之比例、前途恐常不利多方也、結果本月份跌九分、二月份跌五分、三月份跌六分、四月份跌八分、現麥因標準大跌、廠胃平平、各檔開價又落四五分、開山東歸德明光麥三元八角四分、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥因西南之旱與寒、現漸爲一般人所討論、市面呈漲跌俱能之勢、多空二方籌碼皆無擴大之意、</p>

<h3>米市南穩北疲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源共到四十餘號、貨共七八千石、而銷塲因昨市一番猛跌、各貨似頗跌透、稍有動動、本街有銷、客路亦有青島帮續辦六七百包、故大勢轉呈定中帶緊之局、如晚稻及各厚粳價除高料者平定、其中市貨已有提起數分矣、杜尖及變陰元等各花色、亦並見轉定也、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到貨三十餘艘、市上各貨去胃白粳短價略交、薄稻變元平淡、各尖呆滯、市價白粳高貨價跌一角、中次小一二角、薄稻變元羊杜尖亦小角許、埠客尖疲象、</p>
<h3>洋客秈旺銷步高</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、本客去化甚旺、雖有洋米新到與續定、而人心均在向上、洋米以產地連日報漲、且有定貨限止登記之説、本客進胃尤貪、昨日開出現貨七千包、期貨一千噸、統由本街内地分去、價比前市又漲五六分、客秈本以產地貨枯價漲、到頭不多見俏、奈受洋米影響、曾有一度跌落、今洋米飛升後、客秈之去化更旺、昨本街辦去糙砶各秈八千多包、内地亦去二千多包、行情因此續大五分、如今後去化再活、或須步砌、</p>
<h3>黄豆貨缺看漲</h3>
<p>丨洋莊芝蔴復出十元大關丨</p>
<p>昨日黄豆市頗緊張、因油餅　　提、且値各路來源不湧、底積日鬆、貨户　意堅緊、故賣買雙方心思一致看漲、統市廠家及内地辦去大連四平街豆三十餘車、大連西城豆二千餘包、牛莊白眉豆一車、歸德豆六百餘包、沙市豆五百包、蚌埠豆及新安鎭豆一車外、又本街及内地採去漢口乍豆二千四百餘包、</p>
<p>芝蔴洋莊去路續暢、昨沙遜洋行有一千噸口胃、祇辦進六百噸、行情復出十元大關、計十元零二角、怡和辦二百噸、即裝價亦十元零二角、錄江帮午後辦進一百噸、價祇十元、現貨東洋帮銷路不淡、故市仍堅穩、</p>
<h3>油市生豆油供不應求</h3>
<p>丨豆餅亦續上漲丨</p>
<p>近日花生油及豆油市况、本因來源缺乏、底積日枯、故價每盤總須加起角譜、但昨市被犬連市報續漲、市塲中購買緊渴、貨户祇有少數供求、致市劇提、計花生油漲二角、豆油漲四角、後情大局仍屬俏俐、豆餅市自汕頭帮問津期餅以來、市况頗居挺秀、昨市四牌現餅已開一元四角四分、</p>
<h3>五金青鉛交易仍難起色</h3>
<p>青鉛交易、向以黄丹廠油漆公司以及錫紙廠鉛字房等爲最暢達、茶棧帮自改用鋅皮之後、對於青鉛所作之鉛箱、亦頻見减少、是以其出路殊不及先前熱閙、近幾月來、市上因供過於求、趨勢極覺萎靡、雖迭經同業竭力設法及推銷、但終以環境惡劣、故其實交依然難見起色、茲將各市商况分錢於下、</p>
<p>（洋鉛）近來到頻見裝來、故堆積在外棧者、十分充斥、惟本埠客帮生意不見動静、而本街廠家點綴亦十分鮮少、是以市情之清静、極有難於形容之概、雖邇來同業竭力推廣招徠、無如年盡歲底、銀根緊急、終無大批交易、行情每担估十五元二角、半比前殊少變遷、聞少許買賣、行開十五元四五角不等、</p>
<p>（土鉛）雖到貨不多、但出路有限、是以市勢亦十分萎呆、行情每担估十四元七八角、倘另售及門莊生意、行開十五元光景、連日交易祇有零星、殊少躉批、聞月内漢口方面、尙有大批現貨、可以裝來、是以近來本埠人心、極覺衰弱、預料行情方面、將來恐有趨軟傾向、</p>

<h3>藝術與美</h3>
<p>— 周曼亞女士</p>
<p>歌德説；「藝術是不過形式的給付」·我們可以改變這定義而説，「藝術是一種表現的或陳述的方法」。於是就發生了這問題，要如藝術是給付形式的或表現的陳述的方法，那麽他究竟給與什麽以表現以形式呢？我們可以這樣的答·藝術是給與「人類的意識」Humanconscjousness)以表現以陳述，而流露人類的思想與感情，不問藝術之領域如何，純潔之愉快的溝通，生命之豐滿的流露，以及形式之美麗的表現，在一切美觀的形像與悦耳的音調底創造中·是藝術之最初的原始的作用。</p>
<p>「創造思想」及「流露情感」而予以形式·或是找出表現的適當的方法，是一切藝術之主觀的精神底任務。如要達到此目的，降需要有客觀的媒介物，並且依照對此媒介物之一切美之本體的凖則、「藝術的車輪」（ThevihicIeufart）具體的説，是「文定」「聲調」和一切「生硬的材料」，這些車輪之熟練底駕駛，以及其美之性質之深刻的體會，是藝術家之重要的任務。體騐是否深记刻，技巧是熱練，可以區别出具有同樣思想及情感之藝術家的成功底大小。</p>
<p>但是我們應當明白，藝術家由於要表現一種思潮或情感，創造出一定的模型，並非其最終之目的。這形式不過是經過了精神底滿足後，表現出自已的一種流露的層累吧了「美的追求」，也同樣不是藝術之最後底目標，不過是一種精神滿足所造成之藝術表現中，所不可缺乏的創造物吧了！藝術的任務。是在創造理想的世界。一切由思潮所引起之意識，情感；默會以及人生之各方面的質素，在美的具體的形式中表現出來，由此我們可以知道藝術之邏輯底批評，是需要我們不但測量一個藝術家之技巧上的能力以及他表現美之質素於藝術意識底成分，而是要更進一步，問問這位藝術家究竟是選擇了人類精神之那一部分而表現於創造之形式，不過包含於一件作品中的思想，並非是一定要藝術才能創造出來的，因爲人類的情感和思想，往往是因爲種族或意識的聯絡而是共同的，比如表現于“OIyumpiaZeusofpheidies"之「神聖主權」的觀念，或是表現。於拉飛爾“ModomadiSanSisto"之「偉大的母愛」，多是當代士共共有的思潮，不過藝術家之個性，他的智識的與道德的特性，以及他的性感與思潮之特殊的路由，他個人對於給予他表現人類意識之觀念的材料的態度，多是可以影響到他題材的選擇與形式的給付，而且可以决定他所創造「美的模型」的特别的形式，比如有爲種族相同及時代所共的思潮，給與藝術家以體騐，給與他以體騐是產生藝術作品之决定條件，但是他的特性，以及技巧的好壞，决定了他之作品底成功或失敗，西諾納厲（SignoIeei）所失敗及達不到的，白雲奴Perugino是成功了，超越了。蜜齊恩洛(MicheIangelo)是一個深沉的作家，然而拉飛爾（Raphael）則傅爲美神的降世。</p>
<p>這樣看來，藝術是藝術家顯示羣衆的人性底分析或表現，藝術之題材，是包含着人類所想像所感從以及所作爲的一切，其深遠有如宗敎，廣闊正似人生，但藝術與宗敎及人生所不同的，乃是藝術的作品裏，是添附着美的質素。缺乏了美之質素，就不成立所謂藝術這東西，藝術的世界並非敎堂及學校，而是神遊的花園，人間的天堂。他並不明明白白的對你宣傅及説敎，而暗暗默默的讓你體味和静思。藝術的田園裏，實際上没有玄妙的抽象的東西，多是一些平凡的人性的事物。「眞理」及「善好一在藝術的世界裏，化爲「美之質素」而現形。科學的機械的法則，在藝術的世界裏是不容存在的。藝術的世界。是一個自由的天地，除了活潑的表現人性以外，並且給人類以靈魂的安慰及純潔。</p>
<h3>流轉在關東的回憶</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>在端陽前兩天，别了新婚二十七日的深汀，一個人　個假名字流轉到關外去了。第一次住脚是在瀋陽，投寄在一個老佃户家，他們在那兒混機房，一張大坑，長長的。男的女的都睡在這上面。除了主人以外還有幾個寄宿的同村人。他們都是以賣菜爲生的。乍到這生活有些不慣，久了也由不得自已的不慣了，我不把實話告訴他們。可是我明白他瘊對我的行跡在心上是　着問號　的，白天。他們賣菜去不讓我跟着，我只得悶在家中和老女人嚕囌。有時耐不住悶跑到東郊去找賣菜的朋友，他們很替我担心似的把一個葦笠蓋在我的頭上了，這樣好似便可以把一切全蓋過了。</p>
<p>我是在這兒候祖父的信的。信到底候到了，是在專差的衣襟上縫往了的。祖父説事情志了鐵案。希望像鳥雲中透不出的陽光。命令我十年以内不准寫家信，叮囑我不要學小兒作思家的哭。可是我眞小孩子似的哭了，隔着竹籬向一位在小學裏念書的姑娘借來了一枝鉛筆我偷寫家信了，落上一個假名字，怯怯的投到了郵筒裏。</p>
<p>祖父的一封信把我又充出了數千里路。我轉到松花江畔的依蘭去了。用了一套半眞半假的話瞞過了一位同村的族伯。便在他那裏寄托着了。他在法院裏做書記官，家庭也在那裏，住房太狹，他把我安排在相距二里的一家賣切麵的山東老鄉的店裏；我呌伯父給找事做，他便命令我每天練習寫字，好似字寫好了事馬上司以到手。依蘭常有雨，下過雨平地上泥深半尺，冐着雨，踏着泥一天爲食宿而奔波。路上，經過一些破爛的妓院，一些人妖不知我的心苦還依着士門向我笑呢</p>
<p>伯父終於把我介給到法院中當了錄事，廳長下了條子，生活費每月十五元（哈大洋，合現洋九元），幾位同事都給我道喜，説是一起批十五元是大有後望的，他們到差三年了，每人一月是大洋六元。我和一位書記官長睡在一個屋子裏，那個人是頑固的同時又是個極享樂主義者，吃餃子都是九種饀的。他日夜喝酒，喝醉了就駡人。</p>
<p>乍到廳裏大家都對我好，工友也很和氮。後來却全變了，重要的公事都推給我寫，我小心寫的，可是越小心錯越多了，每天寫的是罪人的名字，（至今我還能記起一些老長的白俄的罪人的名字）聽到的是銬鐐的聲響。</p>
<p>中秋鐐下了三元錢來，除了給廳長送禮還剩了兩塊。這時天已降雪了，我身上還是一件夾衣裳。把這錢買了點節禮冐着冷風送到伯父家中，逢人便説：「伯父約我家去過節呢。」</p>
<p>青年人和青年人容易接近，我認識了一位小學校長不到一週，我便成了他的敎員了。半天的工夫過在青年隊伍中，生活也有了些生趣。可是不到半月，祖父的信突然帶了意外的歡喜來，也帶了錢來。呌我立刻到上海去，讀了信以後，半天的工夫，辭了兼職，領出錢來，打了通電給深汀便趕着上了船，校長很奇異，使人送了一包禮物到船上去，外附一片，寫了一套很動情的話，上欵寫着我的假名字，船開了，對於八個月的關外生涯頓然感到有些捨不得了。</p>
<h3>鄉村敎育</h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>丨「續一男一女」</p>
<p>當天上星星擠着眼，晚風凉凉地打着臉的時候，我又孤獨地踏上小清河的橋頭，小清河水流映着蜈蚣船上的紙燈籠，微微地在黑暗中顫動着一綫綫地光明，在黑壓地空間展開去。突然地，船頭上潑水，嘩的一聲，哧得母雞咕咕地呌起來了。</p>
<p>這交通大道上没有了行人，嘈雜是隨着黑暗暫時的死去。我是刻板的每天要經過這裏，有月亮的時候，總有一個影子伴着我行走，但現在，我連影子也失去了。幸而路是走熟了的，一年多的時光，使我的脚板熟悉了那黄泥路的崎嶇；特别高興在黑影裏狂吠的狗，像熟悉了我的氮息似的，一聲不響地在我身邊踱過去了。我還可以聽着他嘴裏微微的喘息。</p>
<p>我雖然是住在那小廟改的學校裏，但是每天照例地要到河西給鄒鄉紳的兒子上生書。鄉村學校的敎員不如給鄒鄉紳守門的那隻捲毛狗。那隻狗，盡了牠的職責便有了其他義務；而我呢，除了敎孩子，敎大人，還要義務地作家庭敎師。每季接授了那鄒鄉紳從學田裏扣劾出來的薪水，還要千恩萬謝地。</p>
<p>我用沉重的脚步曳着我的身體，心恩的拍子和脚步的拍子相應合着。那船頭上的水響使我愕然了一下，便走上橋頭。</p>
<p>這時候，在黑暗中我的眼睛一跳，彷彿是水中央，還有那太陽底下的一對屍體載浮載沉着。我不能够忘記的是這兩個人和我的關係，可是，我同時又在奇怪爲什麽兩個人縛在一起像犯了姦情似的。譬如今天的事，眞就是出乎我意料之外的。</p>
<p>夜風微寒地打着臉，我就聞到自已觜裏的大蒜臭。</p>
<p>辛辣的大蒜臭，使我更深刻的想到在水裏泡得發漲的那個男子，那個頭上有個疤的男子，他給了我以吃蒜的本領，是在我辦夜學的第二學期，那有疤的人還在作我的學生，他見我爲胃病　繞得失掉了大部精神，於是他每天逼着我吃蒜，我便只好硬着頭皮嘗試一下，等到我再聞到别人黄板牙上的蒜垢不發嘔時、我的胃病可以説好了大半。······</p>
<p>急急地走了約有一里地光景，我便看到我那小廟的燈光，在没有燈光的環境裏，那盞煤油燈彷彿很亮似的。路上没有看到一個遲到的學生，我很高興，想想他們在敎室内焦急等候，我便更加緊了脚步。</p>
<p>我走進那小廟的正殿，一骨炭酸氮立刻把我包圍起來，那羣人身體散佈着肥料氣，呼吸裏噴着醃菜氣，已經壓下我的大蒜氣。他們正在三五地聚集扯閒，像一羣蜜蜂似的爭噪着，看見我進來，於是陸續地歸了他們的土　。黑手展開了地皮色的書本。　　雖然我手裏拿着千字課，但是我的心裏還在追憶着那個頭上有疤的浮屍。我的嘴不自覺的便介紹一個故事給我們的大學生們。</p>
<p>「我先給諸位講個故事」，我説，「這個太事呌」個好學生。這個學生和你們一樣大，你們有人可以當他哥哥，有人可以當他伯伯，他從前没有唸過書　　，他也不想唸書，可是後來他做了生意，就是到城裏成包的買了紗綫給鄉下人織土布········」</p>
<p>我説這話他們都懂得，這幾村裏的手搖紡車雖然没有上游多，可是他也都有木機子來織布，而且近來，他們的紗綫都是從外面斫來，上面還印着洋字。</p>
<p>「他做了生意就發恨自已不會寫賑，可是也没有地方去學，恰好這個時候我到他們村裏敎學生，一天天地到處拉學生，打躬作揖地請他們來認字，無論如何，一班凑不成····」</p>
<p>有些學生爲這話笑起來，他們自已，也有一部分是我打躬作揖請來的。譬如現在直打哈欠的劉鬍子便是。</p>
<p>「可是，還是没有學生，這時候，這個學生曉得了，他就找我來説，鄉下人都是拿着金碗討飯吃，有便宜不知道討，我給你幫忙，我呌他們來唸書，不來唸書的人，買我紗線多討他一吊錢······這樣一下，我在那邊的學校就成了。你們看看我這個學生好不好？我們都要記着；自已弄好自已不算好，一個人總得幫助别人一齊好才是眞好······好了，我們唸書！」</p>
<p>對於農民，只要講點這種簡單故事使人明瞭。説了一點那頭上有疤的人幫我的好行爲，我自已心裏便安慰一點，我打算，遇到一個適當的機會，我選要把那縛在一起女人也説一點給人聽。</p>
<p>敎育書，我在想機會。</p>
<h3>人間世（四）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>他説完這話，臉上還伏着笑意，但是，我清清楚楚看見女主以臉上的笑容，完全消失了而且這可以説是很突然的。她的臉皮，更顯得灰白。我正在猶豫着，猜不透這是什　麽事必我的介紹人又説了話：</p>
<p>「你怕了麽？怕什麽，包在我身上，你犯不到黎主任的手裏。」</p>
<p>我的朋友看出來女主人變樣的原因，給她解釋疑慮，她臉色灰白，正爲了這回事，爲了她是營私的，我是公家的官員。</p>
<p>可是我又何嘗是個「滿洲僞國」哈爾濑警察廳的某某科主任呢，我的朋友誑她作什麽？？他爲什麽這樣介紹我？現在，使得女主人警恐不定，可眞是我的罪過，看來這責任應由該我承担了。我因即向她解説道；</p>
<p>「不是，我不是警察廳的，這是曹先生説笑話，你還不知道他的爲人麽？你放心好了。」</p>
<p>我這樣解釋，滿以爲可以消除她的疑難，但我看她半响不笑的臉，又知道全没有發生效力不過、她好橡下决心不再管這件事似的，我可以説她要把這件事壓過去不談。所以，她不答我的話，反倒另外説：</p>
<p>「小菊，倒茶。請坐罷，黎主任曹先生，這一會眞是慢待了。」</p>
<p>小菊就是給我們開瘦的人，好就是點燈的人，我先以爲她是個十三歲的小姑娘，這回等她從東屋端過茶，我加細看一看，看出來她頂少也是十七歲以上的姑娘。她長了一面大小合適的臉，不醜，也不黑。身子細緻，就是個頭稍嫌矮一黠。她放下茶具，轉身走了幾步，斜着半面身子，笑着對我説：</p>
<p>「黎主任，可要請你帮媽媽的忙。」</p>
<p>我點點頭。</p>
<p>我這樣一來，又像我眞是一個警察廳的主任，像是眞正能帮她們的忙似的，換名句不好聽的話，就是别搗她們的亂。我的内心裏禁不住笑了一笑。</p>
<p>可是，説女主人是她的媽，可有些耐人玩味。一個當媽的，比自已的女兒只大出八九歲除非是繼母才行。那麽，她們的稱呼，是從娼妓分上論起的吧？</p>
<p>女主人點上兩只烟燈，請我們兩個人抽烟，我回絕了，爲的免去麻煩，我索興就説我在，爲的免</p>
<p>理。」</p>
<p>「黎主任，你太客氣了，你怕以後打擾你麽？」</p>
<p>女主人强讓我，看情形，好像她認爲我説「在理」，是在故意難爲她。</p>
<p>她來拉我了，笑嘻嘻的，我倒有些不好意思，臉不由紅了一陣；在平素，我是妖少有同年青女人來住的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>溥儀病危</h3>
<p>— 無法</p>
<p>「前日關外息，溥儀病危，僞組織擬籌擬籌備大典委員會。討論皇位繼承問題，昨日又息，溥儀病勢未愈，診治均未見效，溥已定本月二十一日。赴旅順休養，大典委員會，已由僞官内府大臣沈瑞麟組織就緒。」</p>
<p>據這種消息傳來，溥儀的病，恐眞要不能救藥了。但他的病，到底是什麽病呢？是精神上的病呢，還是肉體上的病？溥儀做了僞滿傀儡皇帝，祇一年有餘，現在忽然害起病來，是否他連做一個假皇帝的福氣都没有麽？還是他害了一個政治病的危症，致不可救藥？</p>
<p>據聞溥儀爲人、腦筋尙屬清楚，此次做了日人的傀儡，一則出於情勢所不得已，二則被一般狐羣狗黨如鄭孝胥之徒所包圍，不得已而出此。并且自登臺以後一切行動，不能自由，處處受日人監視，曾出過幾句憤激的話。「他人説我做傀儡，其實我比傀儡不如，實等於獄内待决之囚犯，」這種口氣，天然對於發縱指使的日人，不能滿意。偵探密佈的日本政領，亦豈有不知，溥儀得病之原，或在於此。</p>
<p>又前日消息，漢奸趙欣伯，於日本調查憲政歸來，已被菱刈藉邀宴爲由，將其槍决。聞其致死原因，卽趙誤以僞組織爲眞正國家，因而對僞機關中之滿人，如事事趨承日人，則當面呵斥之，因此被日當局槍斃。昨日又據關外息，趙欣伯並未槍斃，但悉趙逆現在東京芝田區南町七番地養病，被日人監視甚嚴，聞趙逆病係神經失常，危在旦夕云。如此，卽使趙逆並未槍斃。而在日人嚴密監視之下，神經失其常態，其去死期並必不遠。</p>
<p>故溥儀的病和趙欣伯的病，是同係受一種政治上的病菌所傳植，所以無論請什麽醫生，多無法治療。不然關外發表溥儀病重消息，業已多日，而至今未死，則其是否有病，本屬疑問，卽使有病，可以到旅順去療養，亦未必十分沉重。何以日方急急組織大典委員會，討論皇位繼承問題呢？就這種種症象中加以嚴密的觀測，則溥儀的得病原因，自可不言而喻。</p>
<p>因此我料一般漢奸的中間，抱此病的，當尙有不少。不過因溥儀趙欣伯的病·而其餘的病爲暴力所壓制，亦未可知。或者因溥儀趙欣伯的病，受了一大打擊，而傅染者益多，這看一般漢奸身體的强弱怎樣，和抵抗力怎樣？方能决定他們的病狀呢。</p>
<h3>江上</h3>
<p>— 周漢</p>
<p>坐海船害怕得幾乎没有魂魄的我，一想及坐船，頭就痛。我已經告訴過你，我要到漢口去；就在發信那一天，我爲了坐船這問題煩惱了一個整夜。我問過一個朋友，從南京到漢口，有没有不坐船的路可走，那個朋友對我説，有的，過浦口坐火車到鄭州，然後轉京漢路的火車就到漢口，這是令我多麽高興的消息呵。我决定不坐船，走長江水路，要過浦口坐火車去了。可是，就在當天接到哥哥一封信，説是你旣然要到漢口逛去，就先到九江來逛幾天再走吧。而且嫂嫂還附了幾句話，説是分别了好多年，很想會會我，一定要我先到他們的地方九江去，先到九江然後到漢口，不是應該走長江水路麽？不是不能坐火車，而是只有坐輪船的麽？這眞是氣煞了我，惱煞了我了。哥哥和嫂嫂眞的好多年没有會過了。這回如果不去看看他們，怎麽過得去是不是？而且我那怪聽明的小姪女。我也想要看看她呢。假如我從火車到漢口，然後去九江看他們，可以是可以的,但是從漢口到九江，也是長江水路，在那裏并没有火車，還不是一樣？没辦法，我只得皷起勇氣上長江輪船了。我坐的這隻長江輪船。是招商局的大船，朋友們説，江船和海船完全不同，何况這是一隻大船。我起初不相信，一上船就睡覺，預備給牠弄得頭暈不起來。可是，江船眞的不比海船，一點風波都没有。眞是穩如泰山呵。這樣，我就天天在船沿眺望風景，快樂到令我自已像個小孩子一樣了。</p>
<p>我們故鄉的韓江，你記得吧？有一次，我從澄海坐小汽船到汕頭，經過的兩岸，雖然也是田園多；可是村落都是齊整的，有高大房子的。你看長江的兩岸是怎麽樣的麽？從南京到蕪湖安慶這一段，兩岸的房子都是泥笆屋，而且兩三家在一起，不成村落；遠遠地望到一兩個村落，房子也只是幾十家，那裏有韓江兩岸的幾百幾千家的大村落與高大房子呢。從這一點上看來，長江流域各省，眞的不及我們韓江流域的地方。</p>
<p>江上的風景，我以爲最美麗的是晚霞。你看見過没有？大約是五點鐘光景，夕陽西斜，起初是天上在白雲堆裏放射着幾道黄金色的光芒，後來那一個火紅的太陽就顯現在西邊的蔚籃色的山上，在滾動，在喘氣似地漸漸滾下山的背後去。火紅的太陽，在我的眼底看來，圓而大，大得好像一個鄉下養蠶兒的竹篾盤兒。那是證明我的眼睛不好，有人説，如果在眼睛好的人看來，那是没有那麽大，只是比較中秋的月兒大一點吧了。太陽滾下山背後、天上的雲彩更好看啦。那就是晚霞。黄金色的雲，一變而爲桃紅色的，再變而爲紫羅蘭色的，然後漸漸淡下去，而夜之幕張開了。當天上的雲霞在化妝的時候，江上的水兒也在開化妝跳舞會啦。長江的水兒本來是麻黄色的，陽光一照，變成了黄金色，以後便又變成了紫紅色，而水流激盪着，她們眞是多麽活躍美麗阿。</p>
<p>在船上，雖然比較火車寗静點？没有火車那種機動聲的喧閙，也没有火車那一種搖動；可是，你曉得，客人們的喧閙，却使我不能寗静了。他們在廳上擺了幾灘麻將在打牌，除了吃飯的時間之外，從白天打到夜裏，從夜裏打到天亮，談話的聲音。大呌大喊的聲音，打牌的聲音，有的時候，大呌一聲將我從夢裏嚇醒，眞討厭，九江快到了。以後再告訴你吧。總之，江上是使我不怕。可是也使我不得怎樣的安寗呵。</p>
<h3>經濟負擔</h3>
<p>— 介華作</p>
<h3>熱帶的海灣</h3>
<p>— 熙</p>
<p>家住的離海不遠。上到家南邊的一個小山上，便可由遠樹的隙縫間看到一片深藍的水，那一片水有時會搖上來，上得和樹頂一般高；有時會搖下去，至於看不見；那就是海灣。熱帶的海灣是很美麗的，那裏有聲和色，聲是有拍節的，色是調和的。</p>
<p>海岸，被椰樹包圍着。路是在椰林裏，在椰林裏走是那麽有趣的事；海潮一陣遠一陣近地播來，是那麽清晰的。海那邊的風總是那麽吹來，高的吹在椰樹頂上，椰葉便搖起來，一反一覆，和海潮相和着。低一點的便拂着野草，野草拂着我的脚。</p>
<p>我從椰林裏向海灣走去，越前則沙子越多，越厚，這增厚了我的興趣。椰林裏是那麽安静，没有一點人的氣息，有的只是大自然的拍節；海潮和風聲。沙子路是那麽白那麽曲，很少人走，林裏有很多不知名的鳥，牠們的鳴聲是那麽和諧；更多的大槪是鵲，很活潑很自在地，甩着長長的尾巴在地下躍；牠們並不怕我，三三兩兩在很自在地追逐着，似乎是矜驕，並不曾注意到世上有另一部分的動物。</p>
<p>我走着，脚下漸覺得有些濕了。脚踏處，足跡裏已有了些水。那是黄昏時分了。夕陽裏的海灣，是使我不能忘懷的，萬物都在一種很有拍節的聲浪裏静肅着，各不相擾；能動的，能唱的，自然都給牠們一份快樂，使牠們唱着，和着飛翔着。有些鳥，該是海鴎，把海浪當着活的東西那麽追逐着，在浪花的有泡沫處，牠們住了脚，等那一層泡沫消滅了成爲另外的一層海浪時、牠們便又飛起，那情景很悠閒，很活潑，説來眞是太天然了，一個人在那個地方才眞能自然地顯出他的人性來，愛萬物，愛海浪，愛浪沬。愛海爪，愛風，愛葉············一切都會和他的心相和拍，一切都會引起他的敬愛。</p>
<p>海水漸漸地變成金黄色，我想着，要是在遠山上對着夕陽看海灣，該又是一般風趣了。從樹隙間看得見的那一片金黄，想該是更活潑，更浩蕩，更難於捉摸的了。那是和平的，在水上也許還看見了烟。霧；烟和霧會濔漫起來，把目前罩成一片朦朧。那是很有些使人感到陶醉的。</p>
<p>灣裏没有大船，有的只是不多幾隻漁船，他們都由夕陽那邊蕩了回來，夕陽等着他們，海風送着他們。海鴎爲他們引路，椰樹頂上攏着他們的歌：</p>
<p>不怕海，不怕浪，更搖一下櫓。更撑一下篙，再搖，搖，搖過更高的那層潮··············</p>
<p>於是他們便再搖着，小船在他們歌聲裏起落，一天的疲勞，也許就消滅在那聲調間。「呱·········呱」，海鴎那麽爲他們和着；接着是一片笑，幾陣鄰船間大聲的交談，於是又是海浪。又是風。這些，都有夕陽在海邊等着。</p>
<p>夕陽一沉下去，海潮便怒了。</p>
<p>海上的落日，也是很美的，滿海的金黄色，漸漸地後退。終於海上只剩下一道光；那是跳躍的。光的盡頭。是渾黄的。渾黄逐漸爲晚霞所呑。於是濛朧便襲了過來，濛朧一層地加厚起來便成了夜，海灣的夜是茫茫然的。</p>
<p>夜裏，只有海水對着星星湧，海上没有澄光，漁船都被拴在椰樹上了。我想看看漁燈隨着波濤起落也看不着，只有海水在湧，湧，像原始的海，没有一點人的氣息。</p>
<p>我在海灣找了一家舖子宿了一夜，聽了一夜海潮，當朝陽在海面撒下另一種光輝時，我便别了海灣。我没有看到海的晨妝，我很後悔；在我回來的路上，我只想着海鴎那麽緩緩地飛。</p>
<h3>笑笑的處世藝術</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>Jane　Asuten這麽説過；</p>
<p>「人生在世是何爲？還不是有時笑笑人家，有時給人家笑笑嗎？」</p>
<p>這才是登峯造極的處世藝術，世之談處世藝術者多矣、總没有這兩句話來得别致有趣。人生在世，果眞不過是這樣，——也必須這樣，才能順順暢暢的度過他的一生。自古以來，多少人因爲做人太認眞，結果弄得隨處不討好，鬰鬰以終。甚者身首莫保，死於非命，全都是因爲未　此笑笑的處世藝術的原故。反過來，凡是會笑笑的人，卽不飛黄　達，也總興世無仇。人人説他是好</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>這樣，壽命也總要高過尋常人以上，死時是還滿面春風，死後莫不同聲一哭曰：「唉，世上少了一位好好先生！」</p>
<p>當今之世，社會的艱險，人盡知之，因之這笑笑的處世藝術，也更來得需要，也更來得普遍。跑政治舞台的健漢，凡以笑笑爲處世實筏的，多能「暢所欲爲」，有許多不可了結的事體。往往就在笑笑中圓滿解决，眼看要爆發了。也必會操「平安過去」之券。易培基盜賣古物事件的爆發，據説最大的原因是他的面孔太刻板，不會笑笑，得罪過不少的人的原故。而且凡會笑笑的人，不但各方面都兜得轉，政臺卽遇轉換，自也嘸啥可怕。</p>
<p>等而下之。就是在小塲合如一般的機關裏公司裏學校裏混的人，也同是會笑笑的人的天下。不，這些小地方，笑笑的處世藝術更來得風行，更來得見效咧。</p>
<p>再退一步説，就算你家裏有老米飯吃，也得會笑笑的藝術。古人不説過麽？你若不會笑，「禍豈不從天上來」？在家庭之間，能笑笑，也總有好處。尤其是妻妾滿堂的人，必得學會此一着。</p>
<p>讀者諸君，你們會笑笑麽？在這種社會裏做人，你們還不趕快學會這着，也眞是該死。</p>
<h3>火爐之畔</h3>
<p>— 吴溥民</p>
<p>天下了雪，房裏的火爐早生起來了。覺得房里的熱度就暖若春天了。</p>
<p>生活在春天里的人們是陶醉的。可是，窗外飄飄地在下着雪哪！這是寒冬的季節啊！然而，躺在火爐之畔静静地讀着心愛的詩集的人們也是陶醉的。</p>
<p>偶然讀着一首詠雪的詩，恰巧舉頭望着窗外正在下着雪，一種看雪的興緻，頓時油然而生，便將詩集放在一邊，站起來走到窗前頭，展開那幅白紗織花的窗簾，望着窗外的路上的雪景，不覺深深地失望了。因爲它没有詩中所描寫的那樣美麗，同時，也不是白茫茫地一片。只見它剛停在地上，便毁没了。變成了黑色的汚水，給行着的人們濺在衣服的下擺上而帶回家去。</p>
<p>可是，我剛將窗推開，一陣很尖厲的寒風便滾進房里來了，我忙關上。</p>
<p>「好冷的天氣呀」！我這麽在心坎裏自白着。</p>
<p>猛然朝下瞧見馬路上的行人，他們都穿着短衣的，彷彿血在他們的肉里沸着了一樣，他們毫不怕冷的在馬路上的雪里走着，那種英武的精神，眞是些勇敢的戰士呀！</p>
<p>「我是多麽的懦弱哟」！我想：「爲什麽經不起那一陣寒風就將窗關上了呢？爲什麽要躱在這春天似的的火爐之畔呢？」</p>
<p>當我再坐在火爐之畔，翻開那本詩集、忽從里面落下二句我的朋友周先生的詩：「不作趨炎客，無爐豈久寒」？</p>
<p>我覺到一陣異常的羞愧，將頭垂到了胸之前·可是，這到有些像陶醉在春天的模樣呢！·············。</p>

<h3>凱塞琳赫本的轉變</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>據説驕傲剛愎的脾氣改了</p>
<p>并且已覺悟到宣傅的重要</p>
<p>凱塞琳赫本的脾氣轉變了，你能相信嗎？她的脾氣是古怪而剛愎的。如果説她現在已經換了一副脾氣，差不多是很少人相信的。西人説，豹身上的點子，是不會變動的，中國人亦说，江山易改、本性難移。現在説凱塞琳的本性改變了，豈不是説豹身上的點子，亦會遷移的嗎？</p>
<p>但是這個野貓似的凱塞琳赫本，據説她的脾氣眞的改變了。</p>
<p>他們説這並不是一朝一夕之事，而是在攝成了「小婦人」（ljttjewomen）之後，以至攝製小牧師（ljttjeMinjtor）的中間，逐漸的一種轉移。據説原因很複雜的。或者是她在離婚之後，受到了情感上的剌激所致。亦許是受到了他的經理先生，李蘭海渥（LeIandHayward）的勸告使然。但是最大的原因，恐怕還是在紐約發台表演時，所受到的失敗。無論如何，這個驕傲的，剛愎的，頑固的凱塞琳赫本，確已有了向好一方面的轉變了。</p>
<p>在幾個月以前，愛開華公司的宣傅部，聽見了人家提起凱塞琳赫本的名字，就要頭痛的。她的一舉一動，在在都足以阻碍他們工作的進行，使他們覺得難堪。使他們的成就，化爲烏有。他對待新聞記者的傲慢無禮，早已使她處於不理於衆口的一個地位。她自已以爲，祇要表演出人頭地，其餘一切都可以不管。現在的情形，可不同了。公司裏的宣傳部，已經一變其對待凱塞琳赫本的態度，而重視她，稱讚她了。他們所最覺得快慰的，就是她對於公司方面的宣傳工作，竭力與以合作。她已經覺悟到宣傅價値的重要了。這是她從經騐上得來的敎訓。她讀過了報紙雜誌上，無數攻擊她的文章。她聽到了無數影評家的譏諷謾駡。尤其重要的，她在紐約登台表演的時候，受到的冷酷的批評，便她不得不俯有承認新聞記者和劇評影評者的威權，以及宣傳工作的價値，而使她不得不向後轉。</p>
<p>當然，這種敎訓是一個慘酷的敎訓，而他的轉變，亦是一個痛苦，不得已的轉變咯。可以説，她是碰得滿頭青塊，才向後轉的。所幸的是，她還算覺悟得早，没有到不可收拾的地步而已。</p>
<p>宣傳部重要工作的一部份，就是拍呆片。那就是在每天的攝影工作完畢之後、所拍的死片子。專爲報紙上宣傳用的。從前凱塞琳是很不願意拍這種死片子的。公司裏的宣傳部，亦最拍和她提起這件事，但又不能不請她拍。現在情形不同了。凱塞琳自已很情願的生着拍呆片，常常坐着一拍幾個鐘頭，毫無倦容。如果底片不好，他自已撕了，説再天重拍。這種態度不是與前判若兩人了嗎？</p>
<p>就是她對待同事們和配角的態度，亦是與前不同了。她在拍廣告片子（就是廣告用的短影片）的時候，她一次對着導演説道：「你們爲什麽不將其餘的女演員先放進去，然後再將我的一段加進去呢？」其餘在「小牧師」裏和她合替别人宣傅、這非但不是凱塞琳赫本往日行徑，亦是前的明星所不肯做的事了。</p>
<p>她還有一次在拍廣告短片的時候，一定要請約翰皮爾，和她一同拍。她説他是「小牧師」中的小牧師，應當分給他一些光榮。這種大公無私了心，以及和宣傳部的竭力合作，實在是難能可貴的地方。據愛開華公司當局所宣佈的，這位野貓似的凱塞琳赫本，確已換了一個新人了。</p>
<p>但是究竟一個人的本性，能不能轉移，還是一個問題。人的本性，當然不至於像豹身上的點子，絲毫不會改白文，但是人性的改變，亦許是受了剌激，暫時的改變，而會漸漸變回來的。再則、這也許是公司方面的宣傳。和緩和新聞記者對凱塞琳的惡感的。我們且拭以目觀其後好了。</p>
<h3>評「湖山歌舞」</h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>STudenTour南京</p>
<p>在好萊塢，將電影作爲兒戲，並不自今日始。同時這種兒戲的態度是和整個的歐美電影之没落有連帶關係的。進一步説，像「湖山歌舞」之類的影片，未嘗不是過於着重了生意經的打算·因此很明顯的採取開玩笑的態度·聚合了易於使人們興奮或沉醉的事件·在這裏同時作爲主要的表現。譬如競舟·歌舞以及學生們的羅曼斯·在這裏是作爲能够賣座的題材之採取的。</p>
<p>不過相反的是這些事件凑在一道·結果是庸俗與空虚。事實上組織了一個空想的故事·開玩笑而已。更可惜的是這裏並没有得到作者諸人所預期的成功·譬如説競舟的塲面不够緊張·故事的進展十分零亂·至於舞踏塲面·也是不够表現資本主義電影之綺麗的·其中祇有那幾支情歌·雖然是所謂靡靡之音·可是在觀衆中間頗可獲得好感的。</p>
<p>我們對於美國電影並不過份的要求·而且也看了不少開玩笑的影片·但如這「湖山歌舞」之類·確是不足稱譽的·當我們除聽了幾支嘹亮的歌曲之外不能在其中找着少許可取之點的時候·</p>
<h3>評「抵抗」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>"Sniper"丨丨丨卡爾登</p>
<p>在接着來了些陳舊，平庸，空泛，淺薄，無聊的影片，暗殺，爭風，喝醋，自殺，胡閙，閙得人們十分煩膩，厭倦的當兒。看了這張「抵抗：却不能不有點興奮之感了！</p>
<p>這不僅因爲「抵抗」是一張戰爭片，有着劇烈，激䒢，緊張，恐怖的情緒，與爆炸，衝殺，悽慘，悲壯的調子，而是因爲牠在現實的激盪中，給我們看了較眞實的一頁。没有誇張，也不曾掩飾什麽。</p>
<p>故事的展開是在十五年前。成羣的婦女向着步伐整齊的軍隊，擲花致祝。它以成千累萬的白骨，　　與雪白的十字架結束了作爲這片子的序幕。接着是描寫英法聯軍與德軍相持着的「　静的西綫上」，每天有五六百人被敵方的射警手打苑。於債察不出敵方射繫手所在地，而浪費子彈去　繫的無可奈何中，從後方的射擊偵察訓練學校中，調遺兩位有神槍乎之稱的俄國青年斯利定與西伯利斯基去服務。在他們偵察出敵人的秘密的晚間，在狂風暴雨，凄凉恐怖中去殺子對方的神槍手，曳了屍身回來。事後聯軍大舉進攻，奪得了許多土地。</p>
<p>這時，俄國國内發生了變動，隨着「眞理報」上革命消息的傅佈，俄籍的大部分士兵離開了聯軍的戰壕，紛紛地回國去了。其中的兩位神槍手也由於這樣的對戰爭之不同的理解，走了兩條不同的路。</p>
<p>回國的西伯利斯基在邊境鐵路修理廠中做工工　，把他的打槍技術隨時訓練那些青年男女工人。在一次外來的侵略中，西伯利斯基纔以他優秀的射繫技術，盡了他保衛的任務，而被他最後射中的一個，却是他從前的同學友斯利定。</p>
<p>從編劇藝術上説，這個劇本不能算是十分完美的，演出上也用了許多其他的戰爭片所用過的方法，但過人的地方，却是由於把兩個不同的戰爭，寫得極眞實動人。</p>
<p>有幾處地方，値得提出的，如寫：軍官與士兵間的生活，一邊是留聲機片，啤酒，酣歌與女人的憧憬。一邊却在死亡綫上掙扎。又如寫：兩個人在時代中的没落與生長，也由出身與本質的地刻劃得簡潔而深刻。末後對於拍綱球青年的過於樂觀的不必抵抗論，與西伯利斯基的論調的證實等，對於現實也是頗爲分析與對比的地去認識的。</p>

<h3>滿載笑料熱料的「湖山歌舞」</h3>
<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>這是美國米高梅公司一部介紹一九三五年最新頴的歌譜舞式之大喜劇。全劇專以描寫學府中青年生活爲主。大多數的喜劇之成份，總不免於採用了那些無聊的胡閙，或淺俗的取笑而已。可是「湖山歌舞」郤是根據着現代湖流與青年象徵而構造成的。我們知道現代青年的象徵，是極端生動地追求前進和享受。不錯，那殭得像木乃伊的書本，斷斷不能覊絆住生氣蓬勃的新生命的。那味如嚼蠟，腐蝕心靈的舊觀念，陳思想，决不能够箝制住吾們二十世紀新腦筋的。那些非禮勿動的文質彬彬的君子態度，不妨依時代的變遷而讓它供給作戰台上的姿勢。那些守分行素的名敎，讓它腐壞到化石裏去。所以青年們必需要活潑潑地，走着生命之路，赤裸裸地追逐着你所愛戀的。這是「海上大學」作學府巡禮時所給與的象徵吓。</p>
<p>銀壇滑稽角色除了勞萊與哈台那對老搭擋</p>
<p>之外，另有一對新同行。他們是大鼻子胡説博士傑美杜倫，與若腦子好好先生郤爾斯白德華。同時有全美標準美人二十位，皆係聯邦各大學中的最美麗的校花。現在攝成「湖山歌舞一，這也可叫做學府羣芳會。所表演各項歌舞節目，實足稱一九三五年最新式而將風行全球的。何况還以世界大自然的美利用爲背景呢。歌曲中最嶄新出色者是「新月」，「卡羅」，「蛇舞」，「奮鬥」，「泰士瑪哈」，「大學頌」，「來日方長」等。最後一幕幕競渡，更爲生動精彩。所以「湖山歌舞」，不特是莘莘子們所必看的，亦爲愛好美藝歌舞者一新耳目之絕妙品。</p>

<p>等到曼麗想喊住他，已經來不及了。迭倫的枕墊，颼的一下子擲過去，不偏不歪地正打在煤油燈上。煤油燈一打翻，立即燃燒起來。鋼琴上掛着一條圍巾，跟着就燒了起來。迭倫和曼麗大家奔了上去，想撲滅那火。不想於忙亂之中，迭倫所穿的女人内衣。在背後引著亦燃起來了。等到迭倫狂喊着曼麗替他將火撲滅，迭倫的背後，已經燒壞了一大塊。當然從此以後，迭倫一夜呻吟着，也不再談起什麽愛情了。</p>
<p>到了明天一早，傑弗雷和葆拉趕到了。自昨天晚上起，葆拉因爲曼麗老晚没有回家，就跑到傑弗雷那裏，請他帮忙尋找。傑弗雷起初完全拒絕了。曼麗旣如此不知自愛，他亦何必替她着什麽急。况且自從前幾天决絕之後，他亦不願意再管她的事了。可是後來再一想。康妮現在一定亦在尋找迭倫的。倘使她尋着了他們二人在一起，她一定要和曼麗爲難而不放她過去的。傑弗雷對於曼麗的舊情，後來終久戰勝了理智，就答應了葆拉一同去尋找去。　　傑弗雷和葆拉尋到了這個地方，傑弗雷在走廊上，看着屋子深銷着，裏面聲息全無，未免醋意勃發，口裏説了一聲；「好一個温柔鄉！」葆拉對他看了一看，亦没有説什麽話。等了一回，她说這，「我有鑰匙在這裏。但是我們要定規一下，我們進去之先，掀電鈴呢？還是敲門呢？」傑弗雷咄了一聲道；「遇見了這種事情，普通的方法，是要用斧頭將門闢開的。」葆拉一聲不響，將鑰匙開了門，兩個人就相將進去了。</p>
<p>他們進去的時候，曼麗剛剛從樓上下來，衣服都寗好了。她手裏拿的，是迭倫的衣服，要去送給迭倫的。她猛然看見他們兩個人進來。不覺站着楞了起來。葆拉喊道；「曼麗寳貝，你不要緊嗎？」曼麗道；「當然不要緊，你們來幹什麽？怎麽會知道的·····」葆拉道；「李特夫人····那個拿鑰匙給你的女人····她了一個電話來····她説這眞是一件怪事。當然我告訴她不要緊的····但是，曼麗，你這算什麽呢？」曼麗生氣道；「你怎麽去聽那種長舌婦人的話呢？」她説完了，就走向客廳，要將衣服送給迭倫去。</p>
<p>她走過傑弗雷的西前，覺得有些難爲情，她連睬都不睬他，逕自走了過去。傑弗雷忍不住説道；「這不是我站的地方。我本來不想來的。」曼麗崛强道；「你旣不想來，爲什麽要來呢？」傑弗雷首；「我是爲需要而來的。你好像忘記了。迭倫是個有婦之夫，他的夫人要是知道了，會將你的事情，在全國報紙上宣傅出去的。」曼麗嘴硬道；「讓她去宣傳好了。她失去了丈夫，那或者可以使她得到些安慰。」傑弗雷道；「什麽她失去了丈夫了嗎？」曼麗故意説道；「唔，不諎的。」傑弗雷唔了一聲。曼麗喊道；「關係什麽事？請你説給我聽聽。我有我的自由，我是白人，已經滿了二十一歲！」傑弗雷亦喊着道：「還是一個渾蛋！吃得住打屁股的。」</p>
<p>葆拉插嘴道；」你們不要嚷了····唔，誰去拿衣服送給迭倫呢？」曼麗見了，順手將迭倫的衣服，往傑弗雷的手裏一送，説道；「他睡在客室裏。你給他送去吧。」傑弗雷走進客室，迭倫背朝天睡着，毯子一半掉在地下，露出了背上燒着的傷處。傑弗雷一看，心裏未免得意，走上前去推着他。迭倫哎哟了一聲睜開眼睛看見了傑弗雷，就喊道；「老朋友，老朋友。醫生帶來了没有？」傑弗雷問道；「什麽醫生不醫生？」（未完）</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Stationed in Zhangjiakou Summoned to Changchun</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Two squadrons of Japanese aircraft, a total of six planes, including two reconnaissance planes and four bombers, flew from Chengde Airport on the 16th and landed at Duolun Airport. Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, the Japanese Kwantung Army military attaché stationed in Zhangjiakou, flew from Duolun to Changchun on the 16th, summoned by General Nami, (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A portion of the Japanese Wakamatsu Regiment stationed in Chifeng, Rehe, began transporting supplies to Duolun on the 16th. Furthermore, Japanese infantry and cavalry stationed between Pingquan and Weichang are also being transported to Xifengkou by heavy trucks. The roads from Chifeng to Duolun and Guyuan are extremely busy with Japanese and puppet army vehicles traveling back and forth. One regiment of Li Shouxin's puppet police brigade stationed in Duolun has been transferred to the area between Guyuan and the 24th district. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun left Beiping this morning for Zhangjiakou to handle political affairs. Song Zheyuan stated that the Chahar-Jehol border region is currently peaceful and there have been no incidents. The provincial government recently established a Rural Construction Committee, planning to build twenty new villages, each with fifty households and each household provided with three rooms in a flat. Housing and food will be provided to welcome immigrants. The estimated budget is 200,000 yuan. At the same time, it is planned to establish two schools for boys and girls to accommodate orphaned children. In their spare time from studies, they will engage in animal husbandry. After they grow up, spouses will be chosen for them. By doing this, the population of Chahar is expected to increase. The actual population of Chahar is only over two million nine hundred thousand, so immigration and border stabilization are also essential plans. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, Tokyo reported that the Japanese side has repeatedly requested Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan to withdraw his troops from western Rehe Province, but Song has ignored these requests. Therefore, it is said that the Japanese army will take appropriate measures to deal with Song's troops. This is quite puzzling because Chinese troops have not entered Rehe Province. A spokesman for the Beiping Military Sub-Council stated today that no Chinese troops are stationed on the Great Wall. Song Zheyuan is currently in Beiping, having arrived here a few days ago from Zhangjiakou. (Reuters Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangjiakou reported that dozens of scattered bandits suddenly appeared in Changliang, eastern Chahar, a few days ago. After a search by the local garrison, they immediately fled without a trace. About twenty were captured. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to a Tokyo report, the Japanese army stationed in Chengde has demanded that Song Zheyuan's troops stationed in the eastern border of Chahar withdraw to the west of Guyuan and insisted that the area where Song's troops are stationed (the Guyuan area) belongs to Rehe. At the same time, for the past two or three days, a large unit of infantry has been mobilized and advanced to Danan, while another unit has moved to Dagezhen. (Hualian Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade Thrown at Yu Guan Huitong Bureau</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In front of the Shanhaiguan Huitong Forwarding Bureau, at 6:30 PM on the 17th, someone suddenly threw a hand grenade. It happened to hit an iron railing in front of the gate. The explosive force was very weak, only shattering three pieces of window glass. After the bureau reported to the Public Security Bureau, police were sent to guard the area. After searching for a long time, the perpetrator was not found. Guards have been added in front of the bureau on the 18th, and the bureau is operating as usual. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cao Jianting, the postal director of Hebei, said that since the resumption of postal services with the Northeast, more than 20,000 pieces of mail have been exchanged between inside and outside the customs every day, and the number is increasing daily. The Shanhaiguan forwarding bureau is busy and has increased the number of staff to twelve. It can still handle the workload at present. Because there is too little business in Gubeikou, there are only two people working there, because mail from east of Rehe is forwarded from Shanhaiguan. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Will Arrive at Balitai Airport</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Major Takahashi, a instructor at the Japanese Air Force School, accompanied by Captain Iizuka and Sergeant Kaidani of the Kwantung Army Air Force, came to Tianjin. On the 18th, they went to the Japanese-built airport in Balitai, Nankai, with Kawaguchi, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, to inspect whether the construction meets the requirements. Within this month, the Japanese side plans to send two planes in the name of a visiting aircraft from the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun to land at the airport to test the construction. Currently, a Japanese military police officer and a Chinese police officer from the police station patrol the area every day, prohibiting Chinese people from approaching.

<h3>Remnants of Liu Guitang Surrender to Yutian Militia</h3>
<p>The bandits looted and burned everywhere</p>
<p>Militia disputes unresolved</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Wang Bingxiao, the head of the Yutian County Militia, led his men to contact Feng Shoupeng's Security Force, the militia retreated to Bieshan due to being outnumbered. Feng's troops also received an order from the Commissioner's Office of the Ji-Mi District, forbidding them from pursuing across the border. They retreated to Hongqiao. Since the militia of Wang Bingxiao was oppressed by the militia forces from Ji and Zun counties, they retreated to Da-Xiao Weicheng. Since the two sides were far apart, no incidents occurred for days. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, more than a hundred remnant bandits of Liu Guitang suddenly emerged in the area bordering Yanshangkou, Ji and Yu. They came into contact with the Security Force in Hongqiao. The bandits were defeated. According to a telegram from Ji County, the remnant bandits have joined forces with Wang Bingxiao's men, their intentions unknown. The militia forces in neighboring counties have taken strict precautions. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Bingxiao's militia occupied Yanshangkou to expand its strength, forcing nearby villages to provide five or six able-bodied men and six or seven guns each to help the team resist the enemy. Three hundred bandits of Liu Guitang unsuccessfully raided Yutian on the 16th and returned to Zunhua. The bandits were led by a certain Wang, who had previously served as a brigade commander under Liu and was very familiar with the geography of Zunhua. Therefore, it was difficult for the militia forces to intercept them at will. On the evening of the 16th, they passed through Anzhen and raided Ping'an City, southwest of Zunhua. The town was the only large town, with more than 1,200 households and more than 100 shops. It was besieged by the bandits. The militia fought fiercely inside the town, resulting in fierce street fighting. By midnight, the militia was overwhelmed and retreated to the county seat. The bandits entered the town, committing terrible rapes and robberies, and forcing the townspeople to carry their loot. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The provincial government sent a telegram ordering Sun Jizhou, the commander of the Yutian Security Supplementary Force, Sun Yucheng, the commander of the First Brigade, and Feng Shoupeng, the commander of the Special Service, to strictly restrain their men from pursuing the militia. The conflict will be investigated and resolved by officials sent to the scene. After Wang Bingxiao's militia retreated to Yanshangkou, they dug trenches and piled sandbags near Liujiaying due to the interception of the Ji County Security Force, confronting Feng Shoupeng's troops. On the 17th, both sides entered a state of rest. Yin Rugeng will go with Zhu Shiqin to handle the matter. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandit gang of Liu Guitang in Pingan City was counterattacked by a large unit of Zunhua militia early on the 17th. By 10:00 PM, the bandits were overwhelmed and retreated to the south of the city. Before leaving, they set fire to dozens of shops. More than forty men and women were kidnapped for ransom. That morning, the bandits attacked five villages, including Jinmagaozhuang and Changggezhuang. The villages were engulfed in flames. Villagers fled in tears, and the bandits fired their guns, enjoying their wails of despair. He Xiaoyi, the county magistrate of Zunhua, sent a special telegram to the 200-man militia defending Lengkou, requesting their return to support the effort. The bandits have now been surrounded and fierce fighting is taking place. On the morning of the 17th, more than forty bandits also emerged in Qibaohzhuang, east of Zunhua, and looted two or three villages. In the afternoon of the 17th, they fled to Magaozhuang and merged with Liu's bandits. The bandit gang now has more than 400 guns and 340 to 350 men. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Afterwards, the Ji-Mi Commissioner ordered the Security Force not to pursue them further. Meanwhile, the militia forces from Ji and Zun counties suppressed them. Wang, realizing that he was in a difficult situation, retreated to Da-Xiao Tuancheng. The Security Force also withdrew to Hongqiao. Contact has now ceased. However, according to afternoon reports on the 16th, more than 200 remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits emerged from the border between Ji and Yu counties. They encountered the Security Force and were defeated. The remaining bandits surrendered to the militia. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lin Nancang Town in Yutian was once again occupied by the Security Supplementary Force. The force, numbering one hundred men, entered the town on the morning of the 16th. The entire town was burned down and the embers have not yet died out. The villages along the border of Zunhua were looted by Liu Guitang's bandits. All village rooms were empty. Villagers fled to the four corners of the earth. The garrison troops at various passes in the puppet state of Rehe were ordered to refuse entry to our refugees. Therefore, refugees, young and old, supported each other and fled to Tangshan and Fengrun. The Zunhua County Government is raising funds for relief. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Dozens of bandits have been discovered near Haiyang Town, also receiving fake appointments from Liu Guitang. They plan to raid Yutian.

A small number broke through the encirclement and fled to Magaozhuang to join the main bandit force. (Special Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Disaster Relief Fund Allocation Method Agreed Upon</h3>

The committee chairmen reported on committee affairs, and Sun also instructed the committees to formulate supplementary laws and regulations for the Constitution, Criminal Law, and other adopted laws as soon as possible, according to their urgency. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the discussion of the Official Salary Regulations at the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 18th, the committee members debated fiercely. The case was based on the 189th meeting of the Central Political Council, which resolved to submit the Executive Yuan's draft regulations and salary schedule for civil servants to the Legislative Yuan for formulation of official salary regulations. It was decided at the 39th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on October 10th of the 18th year to submit it to the Legal System and Finance Committees for review. The two committees then submitted it to Wei Tingsheng and other five members for preliminary review. It took five years to complete the review and report to the meeting. The review concluded that the implementation of this case would be very difficult and should be delayed. The formulation of official salary regulations involves many problems, such as equal treatment for civil and military officials, increased salaries, cancellation of fixed office expenses, establishment of a allowance system, and civil service protection, salary increases, and budget balancing, which are very difficult to implement. Therefore, it was proposed to postpone the discussion. Yang Gongda, Li Zhonggong, and others agreed. Luo Ding, Xi Chaojun, Zhao Naichuan, and others believed that the case had already been postponed for five years and there was no need to postpone it further, and they advocated continued discussion. Lou Tingsun, Chen Changheng, Lin Bin, and others advocated first deciding on the principles of salary, submitting them to the Central Political Council for instructions, and then discussing them again. Liang Hancao, Shi Shangkuan, and others believed that the content of the case was complex and advocated that the President of the Yuan submit it to the two committees for long-term consideration. Jiao Yitang, Wang Shufang, and others advocated that the original review committee be re-examined, and then the Chairman announced the vote.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Key to Improving Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>———Reflections on the Rumored Visit of Hirota——— (Chang)</p>
<p>Recently, foreign dispatches have frequently stated that Japan intends to improve its diplomacy with China. For example, Prime Minister Okada will deliver a speech in the Diet expressing the need for amity with China, and there have also been rumors of Foreign Minister Hirota visiting China for negotiations. Although the latter news has been denied by newspapers in Shanghai, rumors do not arise from nothing. We believe that if Japan is sincere in seeking to restore the old friendship between the two countries, China would naturally be willing to negotiate with Hirota. In international relations, turning enemies into friends is not uncommon. The key is whether Japan can correct its past mistakes towards China.</p>
<p>China and Japan are both located in East Asia, sharing a border and similar cultures. Logically, the relationship between the two countries should be better than that with any other country. However, in reality, the opposite is true, which is indeed strange. The fundamental reason lies in Japan's past erroneous policies towards China. In the past, the Japanese also chanted the slogans of "same script, same race, co-existence, and co-prosperity," but in their actions, they always contradicted their words. It is far from realistic to talk about friendship in this way. We dare to tell Japan directly that China has always sought good and peaceful international relations. However, if other countries' words and actions are inconsistent and they consistently fail to understand the true intentions of our people, then China, even if it wants to reconcile, will not be able to do so. Therefore, while it is not impossible to talk about Sino-Japanese friendship today, in order to achieve practical results, Japan must first understand the reasons for the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. Then, with a full measure of determination and sincerity, it must negotiate with the Chinese authorities. Only then can Sino-Japanese friendship be hopeful.</p>
<p>In the past, European white people went out to invade, and their psychological motivation was to regard themselves as a superior race and view the invaded as inferior races. In fact, this kind of psychological state is purely a manifestation of their ambition. In fact, the superiority or inferiority of a nation in terms of theory and learning is not that simple. Take Japan as an example. In the past, it was also discriminated against by Europe and America. Therefore, during the Paris Peace Conference, the Japanese representative made a request for racial equality, which was a breath of fresh air for us yellow people. This is very worthy of our praise. However, in recent times, European and American people's perceptions of us yellow people have gradually changed, and their policy of aggression is not as fierce as it used to be. Unexpectedly, Japan, having advocated racial equality to Europe and America, now wants to apply the so-called methods of a superior race towards an inferior race to its own people of the same script and race. How self-contradictory is this? The Japanese have also spoken of Pan-Asianism. We are naturally happy to hear this, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen also had this idea during his lifetime. However, to achieve the realization of Pan-Asianism, Asian nations must first stand on an equal footing, without mutual control or aggression. Only then can we speak of friendship and cooperation. If the policies that white people used to implement on other races are now being applied to us, then we dare not know their intentions.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Japan truly wants to be friendly with us, we are not opposed to Hirota's visit. However, the key lies in whether Japan has the determination and sincerity to respect our national sovereignty and the wishes of our people. In recent days, the flames of war in Europe have dissipated. The reason is that France could not object to the return of the Saar region to Germany. If Japan can also adopt this enlightened attitude towards our Northeast, then the remaining technical issues will naturally be resolved easily. If this is the case, then even without mentioning friendship, friendship will come naturally.</p>

<h3>Japan Eager to Promote Japan-Siam Amity Plan</h3>
<p>World News Agency, Tokyo: Siam's pro-Japanese tendencies have always been very strong. At the League of Nations General Assembly two years ago, the Manchurian issue was debated, and Japan's claims were denied by a vote of 42 to 1. At that time, only the Siamese representative abstained, indicating goodwill towards Japan. Also, since the current government of Arpa Hongsa was established in June of the same year after a revolution in that country, the relationship between Japan and Siam has rapidly progressed. Last year, the current Siamese ambassador to Japan, Mitrakan Kamraksa, has been eagerly promoting Japan-Siam friendship. Furthermore, Yasuke Yatabe, the Japanese ambassador to Siam, who has been in office for six years, has also gained the trust of the Siamese government and plays an important role in the concretization of the two countries' friendship. Last year, the Siamese government recruited cotton cultivation technicians and lecturers specializing in agricultural economics from Japan, and also decided to send naval officers and cadets from their country to engage in ocean voyages on Japanese ships. As for this year's plans, Siam intends to send a dance troupe to Japan to introduce Siamese art, and also plans to establish a guidance organization for international students to increase the number of Japanese students studying abroad, and further import Japanese medical technology. On the Japanese side, in order to promote political reform in Siam, it will spare no effort to provide all possible assistance. It also plans to establish a new hygiene and medical technology organization aimed at the Siamese public. In the naval field, it is conducting a long-distance flight plan to visit Bangkok. The government is also considering establishing a new air route between Bangkok and Japan. All parties have great expectations for the progress of Japan-Siam friendship this year.</p>
<h3>US and Japan Compete to Open Aviation Routes</h3>
<p>Los Angeles: According to reliable sources received here, trans-Pacific airmail service may begin in April this year. Mr. Li, the Pacific Coast manager of the Ma Zhen Shipping Company, declined to comment on this news, but said that the date is approaching. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Air links between the United States and Europe will soon be realized. President Roosevelt will request Congress to allocate funds to build a Zeppelin-style airship within the next week, so that two regular air routes can be opened simultaneously this summer, one flying between the American Pacific coast and Honolulu, Hawaii, and the other flying between Europe and America via the Bermuda and Azores islands in the Atlantic Ocean. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The problem of developing air routes between Tokyo and Changchun, and between Tokyo and the South Seas, through a joint Japanese-Manchurian venture using Zeppelin airships, initiated by Peer Kabayama Sukehide, Baron Izuto Kiyoshi, former director of the East Asia Development Bureau Ozaki Keiichi, and Doctor of Law Honda Kumato, has recently been progressing rapidly. The airport has been internally designated to be located on a hundred thousand or more tsubo of land in Mobara, Chiba Prefecture. The company name has also been decided to be Pacific Aviation Co., Ltd., and a preparation office has been established, which will be established in mid-March. It will order airships from Zeppelin Company, with a capital of 30 million yen. First, air routes between Tokyo and Changchun, and between Tokyo and the Dutch East Indies will be established. In the future, it also plans to open air routes between Australia, Tokyo, and the United States. It will first use 10 million yen to order an airship from the German Zeppelin Company that is more than one and a half times larger than the Zeppelin airship. In the future, it also plans to build two or three ships by itself. (Electric Communication Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Strengthen Air Defense</h3>
<p>Airfield Built Northwest of London</p>
<p>Expansion of Isle of Wight Base</p>
<p>(London) The Aviation Department is about to build three new military airfields northwest of London. Once completed, the British air defense line, which runs parallel to the coast, will be completed, and the British public's demand for air defense can be said to be satisfied. In addition to building airfields, the air defense plan proposed by the Aviation Department also involves reorganizing the British central defense works and planning to conduct surveys on the southern coast to select sites for aerial bombing practice ranges. The aviation base on the Isle of Wight is also planned to be expanded. (Note: The Isle of Wight is located in southern England, directly in front of the Portsmouth naval base, and its strategic position is extremely important.) (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Saar Region Returns to Germany - League of Nations Council Unanimously Approves</p>
<p>Formal Handover on March 1st - Franco-German Agreement Greatly Reassures People</p>
<p>All Outstanding Issues to be Resolved Within One Month</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations unanimously approved at 9 p.m. tonight the return of the Saar to Germany on March 1st, based on the recommendation of the Saar Committee of Three. Although the passage of this motion was widely anticipated, its rapid resolution relieved the tense emotions of the world. Prior to the meeting, representatives from Germany and France fully agreed before the Italian representative, Mr. Aloisi, on the demilitarization of the Saar region. The Council of the League of Nations convened a meeting at around 8 p.m.</p>
<h3>Mr. Aloisi's Report</h3>
<p>Mr. Aloisi was the first to stand and report that the people of the Saar, in all electoral districts, had overwhelmingly expressed their desire to be reunited with Germany. Therefore, the Committee of Three, based on the will of the people, proposed the following recommendations: (1) The entire Saar region should be incorporated into Germany, in accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty of Versailles and the clauses related to the plebiscite; (2) It is stipulated that Germany will restore sovereignty over the Saar region on March 1st; (3) The Saar Committee, together with the governments of Germany and France and the Saar Governing Commission, will determine all necessary preparations for the change of government and the procedures for fulfilling various obligations. If these preparations are not agreed upon by February 15th, the Committee of Three should submit a recommendation to the Council of the League of Nations, so that the Council can directly handle the matter in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and the various clauses of the plebiscite events recognized by both Germany and France.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>After Mr. Aloisi's report, French Foreign Minister Laval stood up and stated the French government's intentions, saying that the results of the Saar plebiscite were very clear and there was no doubt about the will of the people. Therefore, the fate of the Saar's future has been freely decided by its people. Under these circumstances, the Council of the League of Nations can only decide to incorporate the Saar into Germany. France had anticipated the Council's decision in advance. However, France has always firmly believed in the principle that treaties are sacred and inviolable.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' Mission is Not Over Yet. Now the League of Nations has repeatedly demonstrated its efforts to achieve peace in this difficult situation, which is truly admirable. However, the League of Nations' mission cannot be said to be over yet. Before the Saar region merges with Germany, many important issues remain to be resolved. The League of Nations Committee has a difficult task ahead, and the committee should consult with the governments of both countries and the Saar Governing Commission to establish the conditions for the transfer of sovereignty and prepare various methods for abolishing the current government of the Saar. There are many and complex problems to be resolved. However, the results already achieved will promote the final solution.</p>
<p>Do Not Leave Any Traces of Animosity. Laval continued, saying that the German leader had addressed the people of the Saar yesterday, saying that they should strictly maintain order so that the return of the Saar to Germany would not leave any blemishes in history. Hitler's remarks indicated that after the plebiscite, there would be no more animosity or retaliation towards the people who exercised their free will in accordance with the privileges granted by the terms. Because the final solution must not leave any traces of animosity, and the people of the world hope that it can be carried out with a solemn attitude.</p>
<p>Accepting Immigrants is Humane. The reason why France cannot close its borders is purely out of humanitarian considerations. If problems arise regarding the Saar immigration issue in the future, the League of Nations should handle it fairly.</p>
<p>Accept Hitler's Promise. Laval went on to say that the German leader Hitler had repeatedly expressed his desire for peace in welcoming the return of the Saar, and said that there would be no further territorial disputes with France. I now accept this statement, and in fact, the harmony between France and Germany is the most important condition for European peace. France is a country that loves peace, but based on the lessons learned from history, France should also have adequate guarantees, and other countries naturally have the same rights. Therefore, when international treaties are concluded to mutually guarantee each other, we should not hesitate to join cooperation.</p>
<h3>Speeches by British and Russian Representatives</h3>
<p>After Laval's speech, British Lord Privy Seal Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov stood up one after another and made speeches, saying that the satisfactory resolution of the Saar issue proved the honor of both countries and the League of Nations' position. The Council of the League of Nations then unanimously approved the recommendation of the Committee of Three, and then the chairman, Mr. Ruyshdi, stood up to give a thank-you speech and announced the adjournment of the meeting. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) France and Italy reached an agreement on the handover of the Saar, and it was decided that it would be managed by Germany on March 1st. This agreement was subsequently approved by the Council of the League of Nations, and the people's hearts were greatly relieved. The agreement stated that Articles 41 and 42 of the Treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarization of the Rhineland would be applied to the Saar. If existing financial problems, such as the rights of officials and social insurance, are not resolved, the Council of the League of Nations will convene on February 15 to receive them and seek solutions. British representative Eden spoke at the Council meeting to welcome the agreement, saying that he hoped that the passage of this agreement would help international understanding. This agreement respects both parties and the League of Nations. French Foreign Minister Laval stated that France had already accepted the results of the citizens' assembly vote. He believed in Hitler's words that no disreputable connections should be made to the return of the Saar, meaning that there should be no retaliatory actions. For humanitarian reasons, France does not refuse to accept Saar refugees, but these refugees will become an international problem, and France intends to raise this matter to the Council. Hitler said on January 13 that he had taken firm steps towards Franco-German friendship. It is important to know that no government today can refuse to participate in the establishment of a convention aimed at enabling signatory countries to obtain the mutual guarantees they need. In his final words, Mr. Lai said, "We should strive to make good use of the recent agreement established in Rome." (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Outline of Franco-German Agreement</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Saar Committee of Three, after a long period of discussion and telephone contact with Berlin, has now reached an agreement between France and Germany on the Saar issue. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Council of the League of Nations shall decide on the reunification of the Saar region with Germany in accordance with the conditions arising from the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, the clauses on the abolition of armaments in the Treaty of Versailles shall also apply uniformly in the Saar region.</p>
<p>(2) It is stipulated that Germany shall recover the territory of the Saar region from March 1st of this year.</p>
<p>(3) All outstanding issues related to the Saar region, including business negotiations held in Berlin and Paris, shall be completely resolved before February 15th, and the League of Nations shall file them based on the report of the Saar Committee of Three. If all outstanding issues have not been completely resolved by February 15th, the Committee of Three shall submit a recommendation to the Council, and the Council shall convene a special meeting to take necessary decisions.</p>
<p>This compromise on the Saar issue has been delayed for a long time, and the main difficulties are two: one is the issue of demilitarization of the Saar region, and the other is the arbitration power of the Council of the League of Nations on issues related to French interests. Germany advocated restricting the scope of the Council's decision-making power, limiting it only to the establishment of a new political system in the Saar, while France demanded that the Council have the power to clear up all past outstanding issues, such as private debt issues. The first of these two difficulties, such as issues related to the police and the establishment of airfields, has been agreed upon in principle, and the second is now also agreed upon. Therefore, in tonight's Council meeting, there should be no more difficulties, and the resolution on the Saar issue can be safely passed. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Declaration: Germany is Willing to Work for Peace</h3>
<p>Reiterates That There Will Be No Future Territorial Disputes with France</p>
<p>Equality is the Only Condition for Returning to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(London) German leader Hitler, in a conversation with London Daily Mail correspondent Price today, made a firm statement on Germany's commitment to peace. The conversation took place in Munich. Hitler's statement included the following points: First, Germany itself will never disrupt peace; second, if others invade Germany, it would be like walking into a trap, saying, "We have now voluntarily assured France that after the Saar issue is resolved, we will have no other territorial disputes. At the same time, I dare to say that we will never sacrifice our equal rights in the international community under duress." Mr. Shan asked under what conditions Germany could return to the League of Nations. Hitler's answer was quite indignant, saying, "No one in Germany is willing to make returning to the League of Nations contingent on any conditions. There is only one thing to be resolved: whether Germany can participate again with full equality." Hitler also stated that Germany has absolutely no intention of challenging for its own benefit, and said, "If the interests of other countries have nothing to do with Germany, we are even less willing to resort to force on their behalf."

<h3>The Political Status of the Third Germany is Consolidated</h3>
<p>No Statement on Austria</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Deeply Disappointed</p>
<p>(Rome) Since the victory of the Saar plebiscite, the political status of the Third Germany has been consolidated. However, the German government has neither made a formal declaration nor issued a comment, providing a definite guarantee that Germany, having won the Saar vote, will not have any further ambitions for other parts of Europe in the future, especially for Austria. There has also been no indication regarding the possibility of Germany returning to the League of Nations. Therefore, Italian newspapers are quite disappointed. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Refugees Flee in Disarray</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken. Early this morning, a Reuters reporter at the Saar station in Beringen witnessed 500 men, women, and children fleeing from the Saar, staggering out of the station in a state of disarray. Most of these people were Germans and opponents of Hitlerism. Having heard that the Saar Governing Commission had issued a warning that if they remained in the territory, their safety could not be guaranteed, they moved in haste. After the local government provided them with a meal, they were transported by train to Toulouse. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken. Today, touring the Saar border and the French province of Lorraine, I saw that the number of people fleeing from the Saar into French territory is increasing daily, including people of all levels, and Jews are not a few. There are now more than 400 people passing through Saarguemines, and another hundred passing through Forbach. The French patrol team on the border is now strictly guarded, allowing only those with French passports to enter. Those who are allowed in are provided with food and lodging by the French authorities, but the expenses will be collected from the League of Nations. Although several refugees mentioned the brutality of the National Socialist Party, a special Reuters reporter was unable to find anyone who had been insulted. Leaders of the German Front claimed that the fears of the Communists, Socialists, and Jews regarding atrocities were unfounded. However, the refugees still believe that the current calm is the tranquility before the storm, and that an outbreak of opponents of Hitler in the Saar is imminent. For several days, crowds have gathered in front of the Saar French consulate to wait to receive passports to go abroad, which is sufficient evidence of the general panic of the people. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Saar region Socialist leader Blum, who was one of the strongest advocates of maintaining the status quo, fled to France for safety after the Saar vote decided to return to Germany. According to reports, Mr. Blum will give a speech at a meeting somewhere, advocating that various fascist groups should be dissolved. A member of the Paris City Council, upon hearing this, immediately requested the Chief of Police to notify Mr. Blum that he was being accommodated in France and should behave with courtesy and not make such remarks.

In the next two days, he will consult with representatives from Britain, Italy, Russia, the Little Entente, Hungary, and Turkey to complete the Eastern European Locarno Pact. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives from various countries continued to hold talks outside the Council of the League of Nations. In the morning, French Foreign Minister Laval met with Greek Foreign Minister Maximos, who is the chairman of the Balkan Entente countries' conference. This conference was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, but was postponed to this afternoon due to the Council's discussion of the Saar issue. At noon, Mr. Lai also met with British Lord Privy Seal Eden and Italian representative Aloisi. Mr. Massigli, director of the French delegation office of the League of Nations, was present. At lunchtime, Mr. Lai had lunch with Austrian Foreign Minister Weidigger. After the meal, he met with Spanish representative Madariaga. It is generally believed that the work of the Council will come to an end, and Laval can leave for home tomorrow night. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>The Situation is Favorable to Persia</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to hold a public meeting tomorrow to discuss the dispute between Iraq and Iran (the new name for Persia) over the border issue. Italian representative Aloisi will present a report, which international figures here believe will largely represent the Council's opinion and draw a conclusion favorable to Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Kazemi's active activities in Geneva recently are an important reason for the country's victory. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Hungary's Reply to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Officials Neglecting Their Duties Have Been Dismissed</p>
<p>Not Responsible for the Marseille Incident</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the demands made by the Council of the League of Nations to Hungary in connection with the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou in Marseille last October, the Hungarian government's reply today stated that the Hungarian government has implemented them, punishing the responsible officials. The document also firmly stated that it cannot be definitively proven that the Hungarian authorities had a direct or indirect relationship with the Marseille massacre. The Hungarian government has now tightened passport regulations and strictly manages foreigners. It is reported that the officials who have been punished are two police chiefs who have been dismissed, a commander of the Gendarmerie who has been detained for 30 days, and two Gendarmerie officers who have received short prison sentences.

<h3>MacDonald's Speech Emphasizes Stabilizing International Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Other Issues Cannot Be Resolved</p>
<p>The International Situation is Becoming Clearer, Britain is a Powerful Force</p>
<p>Rumors of Early Re-Election of Parliament Are Untrue</p>
<p>Newcastle. Prime Minister MacDonald, in a speech here today, emphasized the need to stabilize international exchange rates as soon as possible, saying that if we cannot solve the international exchange rate issue, we will never be able to satisfactorily solve other issues, because the international exchange rate issue is encountered every day. Recently, the US dollar has fluctuated, and there have been rumors that the United States will restore the gold standard. It is said that the stability of the US dollar and the gold pound is imminent. It is particularly noteworthy that the Prime Minister delivered this speech at this time. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald recently delivered a speech at the Rotary Club of Newcastle, defending the methods and undertakings adopted by the current cabinet, saying that the cabinet's domestic and foreign affairs will achieve complete victory when the international situation becomes clearer, the will for European peace is promoted, and national mutual trust is promoted. The British cabinet is a powerful factor. Regarding the economic aspect, the tariff protection policy should not be rigidly adhered to, but should adhere to the principles of sound economics. Over-intervention by the state is inevitable and inappropriate. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Recently, the Labor Party has repeatedly spread rumors that the general election of Parliament will be held within this year, and there have been such rumors abroad. Prime Minister MacDonald recently declared, "There are rumors abroad that the government intends to hold the general election of Parliament early for some reason. In fact, these rumors are entirely fabricated. I am the head of the government, so I would like to make the truth known to people at home and abroad. Our acquisition of power is to improve the fate of the people. We must use every minute of our time to gradually achieve our goals." (Vasi dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress Urges the Enactment of Social Relief Laws</h3>
<p>Those Over 65 Receive a Monthly Pension of More Than 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Unemployment Insurance Deduction of 3% of Wages Paid by Employers</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress yesterday, recommending the adoption of a large-scale social welfare program, including unemployment insurance, pensions, relief for impoverished children, and increased subsidies from the federal government, as well as fundraising by local governments to develop public health in various states, counties, and cities. According to the government's proposed method, this social welfare program should be implemented by the state governments, and the federal government should retain financial management rights. After President Roosevelt's proposal was put forward, New York State Democratic Senator Wagner immediately proposed a social security bill, stipulating that a compulsory pension insurance system should be established from January 1, 1937. The insurance premium is collected at 1% of the wage income, with employers and employees each contributing half. After being insured, Americans can receive a monthly pension of US$22.50 per person from the age of 65. In addition, unemployment insurance measures are stipulated, with the insurance premium being 3% of the wage, which is paid by the employer. The expenses for implementing the social welfare program, including those for pension insurance, are US$150 million per year; those for unemployment insurance are US$50 million per year; and those for child relief are US$28 million per year. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's message to Congress today stated that the report of the Cabinet Economic Security Committee should be formally adopted as a proposal, so that the people of the whole country can have security in the various dangers of life. This is what the president promised in his message at the opening of Congress. The President now urges Congress to enact the Committee's recommendations into law as soon as possible, without further delay, and stated that all recommendations are suitable for the psychology of the American people. The Committee does not want to force people to do things that are difficult, and has carefully considered all the facts. The message also stated that once this plan is launched with government funding, it will be self-sufficient, and all expenses for paying insurance claims will not need to rely on tax revenue. The proposal also includes measures for the government to assist children who are unable to stand on their own feet and local health agencies, but the President said that he does not intend to hold health insurance for the time being. The start-up cost for implementing this plan is US$100 million. The President believes that this number is less than the funds currently required by the country to deal with economic insecurity.

<h3>Report on the Work of the Soviet Russian People's Commissar Government</h3>
<p>All Industries Have Made Progress</p>
<p>No Fear of Japan</p>
<p>(Moscow) Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Vyacheslav Molotov, reported on the work of the Soviet government at the All-Union Congress of Soviets. Molotov asserted that over the past four years, the national economy and culture have not only developed significantly, but class relations have also undergone major changes, fundamentally transforming the face of the Soviet Union and enabling socialism to dominate the entire national economy.</p>
<p>Industry  Molotov elaborated on the progress of Soviet industry, stating that Soviet factories are now capable of manufacturing their own machinery. Heavy industry has fully completed its annual production plan, and the plan to improve quality will also soon be completed. Quality, he noted, has been the weakest point of Soviet machinery in past years.</p>
<p>Agriculture  Molotov then discussed agriculture, pointing out that the degree of collectivization in Soviet Russia in October 1934 was 73.2 percent. He stated that this percentage has certainly increased significantly, as the number of individual farmers joining collective farms has been the highest in recent months. For example, in the western provinces, nearly 5,900 farms have joined collective farms in the past three months, 2,400 in the Leningrad province, and 6,500 in Bashkiria. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (1937), the collectivization effort will be fully completed. "I believe we would not be greatly mistaken if we said that this work could be completed even earlier." Molotov further stated that the country's animal husbandry has also improved, with an increase in all types of livestock. He detailed the strengthening of collective farms in terms of economics and organization, stating that due to improvements in the work of collective farms, spring sowing in 1934 began earlier than in previous years, and harvesting and grain delivery were both better and faster than in previous years. This year, collective farming in all states and provinces will continue to improve, and the material conditions of collective farmers will also rise. Molotov also cited figures to demonstrate the improvement in the material and cultural life of collective farmers.  Education  Molotov then discussed the great success of cultural and social work, stating that Soviet Russia is not only implementing compulsory primary education but also wants to raise the level of universal education to secondary education. There are currently 17.2 million students in primary and secondary schools nationwide, compared to only about 6 million before the revolution. The proportion of illiterate adults, which was 35 percent in 1931, is now 8 percent. Investment in municipal economy and housing construction has reached a total of 6.5 billion rubles, with more than 19 million cubic meters of new housing added in various cities.</p>
<p>Culture  The success of national republics and provinces in economic and cultural aspects is most significant. The speed of their industrial development is greater than the average speed of the Soviet Union and Soviet Russia. A characteristic of the state and local budgets of Soviet Russia is the substantial increase in expenditures on cultural work. From 1930 to 1934, the state and local budget amounted to an increase of 4,297,700,000 rubles, of which 3,300 million rubles, or approximately 77 percent, was spent on cultural aspects. The state budget of Soviet Russia for 1935 is 1,708,500,000 rubles, and the local budget is 869.3 million rubles, an increase of 27.9 percent compared to 1934. The construction costs for the entire Soviet Union in 1935 will be 21.2 billion rubles, of which approximately 15 billion will be used within Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>International  In his conclusion, Molotov discussed the international situation, stating, "During the past period, the strength of the Soviet Union in the international arena has greatly increased. At the same time, various countries recognize that the Soviet Union is an extremely important factor for peace and international relations throughout the world. No major international problems can be resolved without the participation of the Soviet Union. During this period, the working masses of our country have paid extraordinary attention to our eastern border, where the cause of peace has been repeatedly thwarted. The Soviet Union has always used its steadfast policy of peace to resolve various disputes peacefully." Molotov added (at this point, the audience applauded thunderously), "I believe that our eastern neighbors must understand that our resolution of such complex disputes is by no means due to the weakness of the Soviet Union, but rather to the Soviet Union's determined pursuit of peace. The reason why our eastern border is so peaceful and stable is partly due to the fact that the Soviet Union's foreign policy will continue to resolutely strive for peace, as in the past. At the same time, it is also because our country is prepared (and I must emphasize this) to repel attacks from any direction at any time. I believe that this Congress will instruct the government to continue to vigorously pursue a policy of peace in the future, and to use this as the foundation of its foreign policy, striving to establish normal diplomatic relations with all countries and guaranteeing all methods to strengthen our country's national defense capabilities."

<h3>Soviet Russia Sentences Zinoviev to Ten Years of Imprisonment for Counter-Revolutionary Activities</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The verdict of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union regarding the case of Zinoviev and Yevdokimov has been announced here.</p>
<p>Main Text  The verdict states that according to the court's investigation and based on the defendants' own confessions, it is proven that Zinoviev, as a counter-Soviet faction member, did organize a secret counter-revolutionary group and was led by the so-called "Moscow Center Group." This group remained in existence until their arrest. Its members included Zinoviev, Shalov, Kuklin, Yevdokimov, Gherdik, Bakayev, Kamenev, Fedulov, and Gor-Shinin. The court confirmed that the Leningrad secret counter-revolutionary group, headed by the "Leningrad Center," was also led by the "Moscow Center Group." The members of the Leningrad group have already been executed for the Kirov assassination case. The court also ordered members of the counter-revolutionary group (whose cases must be further investigated) to testify in court. These individuals (Shavalov and Elkovich) provided the court with many facts regarding the secret counter-revolutionary work of the "Moscow Center Group" (especially regarding Zinoviev, Gherdik, Kuklin, and Yevdokimov). They confirmed that the "Moscow Center Group" had repeatedly attempted to collude with other counter-Soviet groups to expand the struggle against the Soviet regime. The court did not obtain any evidence that members of the "Moscow Center Group" had incited the assassination of Kirov. However, the court did confirm that members of the "Moscow Center Group" counter-revolutionary group were aware of the terrorist tendencies of the Leningrad organization, and that they had incited such tendencies. Verdict  All defendants confessed to their crimes. The Supreme Court announced the following sentences: Zinoviev, as the main organizer and most active leader of the secret counter-revolutionary group "Moscow Center," was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Gherdik, Kuklin, and Shakov, as the most active members of the group, were each sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Shalov, Yevdokimov, Bakayev, Gor-Shinin, and Chailkov, for actively participating in the work of the group, were each sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Fedulov, Heilsuburg, Heissen, Tilosov, Panlyemov, Annishev, and Vavilov, for participating in the work of the group, were each sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Kamenev, Bashkirov, and Brav, for participating in the work of the group but not actively, were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The court decided to confiscate all private property of the convicts. The Extraordinary Meeting of the Internal Affairs Commission sentenced 49 members of Zinoviev's counter-revolutionary group to four to five years of imprisonment in detention camps, and 29 people were exiled to various places for two to five years.

<h3>Japanese National Shot in Changli</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Believes the Incident is Serious</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Returns to Tangshan to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence. Tao Shangming, Special Commissioner of the Yulian District, hurriedly returned to Tangshan from Tianjin this afternoon. Before leaving, he visited the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin and met with Japanese Vice Consul Tanaka Shotaro to exchange opinions on the recent Konno incident in Changli. After returning to Tangshan, he will discuss the matter with Watanabe, the Deputy Consul of the Tianjin Japanese Consulate Branch stationed in Tangshan. The Japanese side believes that the Konno incident is serious, similar to the Miyakoshi incident that occurred in Yutian last year. The Tianjin Japanese Consulate has ordered Sato, the Chief of the Shanhai Pass Police Branch, to lead patrol chiefs and patrols, and dispatched several senior criminal officers to Changli, the site of the incident, to investigate the perpetrators and investigate the case. At the same time, the Tianjin Japanese Consulate dispatched Owa, the Director of the Judicial System of the Tianjin Police Department, and Chao Jih-sheng-ying-nei to assist Sato in investigating the case. Japanese agencies such as the Changli Japanese Army Garrison and the Shanhai Pass County Gendarmerie Branch Office have each sent specialists to handle the case. Tianjin Japanese newspapers have expanded their publicity of the matter, describing it as an unstable act by the Changli County Security Team and the militia, endangering the lives and property of Japanese residents, and urging the Japanese army to take immediate action, causing panic and widespread fear in Changli. According to reports, the cause of this incident is that Marusan Yoko, located on Erdao Street in Changli City, is owned by a Japanese national named Konno Kanekura. Konno specializes in colluding with Japanese and Korean rogues to sell drugs. On the 4th of this month, he was ambushed by a Korean rogue due to unequal distribution of spoils. At the time, Konno happened to be urinating and was spared by hiding in the toilet. Afterwards, Konno reported to the County Government, resolutely demanding the search and arrest of the Korean and his delivery to the Japanese side, or his extradition and punishment by the Japanese side. Although the County Government had tried its best to search, the Korean had long since fled after failing in the ambush.</p>

<p>He had already fled far away. Konno suspected that our side had deliberately let him go, and accused our side of taking bribes. He reported this to the Japanese Gendarmerie Branch Office stationed in the county. The sergeant of the branch office questioned our side. Then, on the 8th of this month, Konno took drugs to Luo County to sell. Just fifteen li outside the north gate of Changli, in a place called Xiaoyingzi, he suddenly encountered two Koreans who jumped out and ambushed him. They fired three shots in a row. Two bullets hit Konno's buttocks, and one bullet hit his left temple, causing heavy bleeding and causing him to collapse to the ground. The two Koreans then searched his body for all his belongings and fled. Later, a villager discovered Konno lying in a pool of blood and rushed to report to the nearby militia defense station. The station carried him away on a stretcher and transferred him to the County Government. This was later heard by the Japanese Army Garrison, who then carried him to the garrison and transported him to Tianjin overnight, where he was admitted to the Japanese Kyowa Hospital for treatment. Although his injuries were serious, they were not fatal. It has been ten days, and there has been no change. The Japanese side was unable to obtain Konno's confession, and strongly claimed that this was done by the Liu Zuozhou's Unit, the First General Team of the War Zone Security Force stationed in Luo County, and the local militia of the county. They said that the previous ambush he suffered in Luo County was also done by Liu's unit, and that Liu's unit had suspected him of selling drugs and demanding kickbacks, and had thus harmed him. They said that he had more than 800 yuan in cash and several pieces of jewelry on his person, which were all looted. The Japanese side took this as fact and the Tangshan Japanese Vice Consul Watanabe lodged a protest to Tao Shangming. Tao planned to send personnel to cooperate with Changli County Magistrate Wan Yi to conduct an investigation after returning to Tangshan, and then proceed with the handling. After this incident occurred, in addition to dismissing the heads of the security team and police station at the site of the incident, County Magistrate Wan dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate the murder separately. This matter was still swirling, when on the 13th of this month, between Qinhuangdao and Shimen, a Korean rogue riding in a long-distance bus also refused to pay the fare and refused to listen to the security team's inspection, resulting in a conflict and brawl. The Japanese side also claimed that Liu Zuozhou's unit was intentionally making trouble for the Japanese and Koreans, and filed a protest on both matters. (15th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Returns to Beiping</h3>
<p>Will Travel Between Nanjing and Beiping Frequently in the Future</p>
<p>Huang Fu Departs South in Eastern Attire After Meeting He</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: He Yingqin, Chairman of the Beiping Military Sub-Council, returned south from Beiping on October 7th of last year to manage the affairs of the Ministry of Military Administration. He traveled north on the 9th of this month, representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to attend the memorial ceremony for the late Mr. Yan in Taiyuan. Having completed these affairs, he departed from Taiyuan on the 16th at noon and arrived in Beiping. Upon hearing this news, various Party, military, and political organizations in Beiping City immediately began preparations for a welcome. At dawn today (the 17th), the West Railway Station was guarded by the Beiping City Public Security Bureau's Security Team, the Ministry of Military Administration's Special Service Regiment, the Special Service Company, the Central Military Police Third Regiment, the Beiping Military Police Command, and other military and police forces. Temporary cordons were set up along the route from the station to the Jurentang Hall. A sign-in book was placed in front of the station gate. Those who signed in included Zhang Jianchu, representing Huang Fu; Yu Jiaji, representing the Political Reorganization Council; Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, He Jingwu, Bao Wenwei, Men Zhizhong, Pang Bingxun, Ji Yiqiao, and other members of the Military Sub-Council, as well as chiefs of various departments and sections above the rank of major, heads of various military offices stationed in Beiping, Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang and the heads of various bureaus, Zhan Zhaoyang and Xun Lin representing the provincial and municipal Party headquarters, Leng Jiaji and Wang Zhuoran representing business and academic circles, and others. The municipal Party headquarters also posted welcome banners. He Yingqin left Taiyuan at noon on the 16th by a regular train, arriving in Shijiazhuang at 8 PM that evening. He transferred to a chartered train, departing Shijiazhuang around 10 PM. As it was late when passing through Baoding, he did not disembark but met with key personnel from the Xingying in the train. He continued his journey at 0:10 AM this morning (the 17th), arriving at Xibianmen around 6 AM and reaching Beiping at 7:25 AM. After alighting from the train, He shook hands with the welcoming personnel to express his gratitude and then returned to the Jurentang Hall by car. Those who accompanied He included Secretary Xie Zhongnan, Zeng Jingcang, Military Sub-Council member Liu Yifei, Counselor Hou Cheng, Section Chief Zhu Shiqin, and several others. Around 9 AM, Military Sub-Council members Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Bao Wenwei, Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Pang Bingxun, Men Zhizhong, He Jingwu, Bao Yulin, and others led the staff members above the rank of school officer from various departments and sections to the Jurentang Hall for an audience. Around 10 AM, Huang Fu visited and had a long conversation, departing only at noon. On the same day, He issued a written statement as follows: "Last year, as I had been away from Nanjing for a long time, there were many matters in the Ministry of Military Administration that needed to be addressed. I went from Beiping to Nanjing in October, taking the opportunity to attend the funeral of my mother-in-law, Madam Wang, in Shanghai. Later, due to the convening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, I stayed in Nanjing to attend the meeting, residing there for nearly three months. Recently, the affairs of the Ministry have been largely organized, so I left Nanjing and traveled north on the 9th of this month, also detouring to Hebian Village to offer sacrifices to the late Mr. Yan on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The funeral arrangements for the late Mr. Yan were completed on the 14th, and I departed from Taiyuan yesterday afternoon to return to Beiping. I found that Shanxi Province is making great efforts in production and construction, with excellent results. The Tongpu Railway, which is being built by the Shanxi provincial armory, has already opened to traffic as far as Xinzhou in the north and as far as Huozhou in the south. It is said that the entire line will be open to traffic next year. Shanxi Province has been vigorously promoting domestic goods in recent years, especially products from Shanxi and Suiyuan, which is an excellent phenomenon. The people of the country should unite and promote domestic goods in this spirit, which will greatly benefit the national economy. Since the Red Army bandits in Jiangxi had their old nest in Ruijin destroyed, they have successively fled westward. Although they were intercepted by government troops along the way, a portion still took the opportunity to flee into Guizhou Province, attempting to link up with the Red Army bandits in Sichuan. The Central Government now has a complete plan for suppressing the bandits in Sichuan and Guizhou, aiming to thoroughly eliminate them in the shortest possible time. As the affairs of the Ministry of Military Administration and the Military Sub-Council are both very important, I may travel between Beiping and Nanjing frequently in the future to handle all important public matters."</p>
<p>After being appointed concurrently as Minister of the Interior, Huang Fu originally intended to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to take office. However, due to the need for someone to be stationed in the north, his departure was delayed. Now that He Yingqin has arrived in Beiping, he is scheduled to depart south by plane tomorrow (the 18th). His luggage has already been dispatched by personnel at 6:50 PM this evening (the 17th). It is also said that the Ford plane sent to Beiping for Huang's use has landed in Qingdao today (the 17th) due to weather conditions and is expected to arrive in Beiping at noon tomorrow (the 18th). Based on this, it is speculated that Huang's departure will be delayed until the day after tomorrow (the 19th). It is also rumored that Huang will change to a train to Nanjing and will stay overnight in Tianjin. However, inquiries with informed sources indicate that no concrete decision has been made. Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei Province arrived in Beiping by car from Tianjin at 4 PM this afternoon (the 17th) to visit He and see Huang off. He went to the Jurentang Hall that night to meet with He to report on matters and is scheduled to visit Huang at the Political Reorganization Council tomorrow morning (the 18th) to seek instructions on all matters (the 17th).</p>
<h3>Remnant Bandits in Southern Jiangxi and Western Fujian Will Soon Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Zhu-Mao bandits fled westward, the remnants left behind are led by Ye Jianying, using pseudo-Red Army students as lower-level cadres. Their combat strength is relatively substantial, with the pseudo-Seventh Army Independent Regiment of over a thousand men. These bandits are hiding in the mountains in the border areas of Yundu, Huichang, and Anyuan, including Xiaochazi, Longbu, Tangcun, Renfeng, Chazi, Guilinggang, Luanshi, Shuitou, Xialing, and Maling. They are looting civilian food supplies from various border counties. After Yu Hanmou assumed the duty of pacifying the Sixth District, he immediately dispatched two regiments to suppress the bandits from Ganzhou, retaking LiangKou and MaoDian of Yundu. Ye Gengchang and Song Sitai departed from Xinfeng to suppress the bandits, engaging in over fifty major and minor battles with the bandits in the mountains, all of which were major victories. As of the 10th, over three hundred bandits had been killed, and sixty to seventy rifles and short guns had been captured. Over twenty locations, including Hanfang, Xiaochazi, Longbu, Tangcun, Renfeng, Chazi, Guilinggang, Luanshi, and Shuitou, had been recovered. Ye Jianying led over a thousand remnant bandits, dividing them into smaller groups and fleeing into the mountains in the border areas of Huichang and Yundu, including Xialing, Maling, Niuling, and Dashan. On the 10th, the troops of Song Sitai and Deng Qichang continued to suppress the bandit strongholds in Xialing and other places, and urgently handled post-war affairs in the recovered bandit areas. In the Xunwu and Anyuan areas, stability has gradually been seen since the troops of Deng Longguang were stationed there. The markets in Junmen have resumed trading and are becoming increasingly prosperous. The anti-communist regiment of Ouyang Jiang is stationed near Junmen, protecting traveling merchants. Over half of the refugees have returned to their hometowns to cultivate the land, and the situation is improving daily. In the Changting area, after Li Yannian's division moved back to Zhangzhou last year, Song Xilian's division from Gucheng moved to Tingcheng to expedite the implementation of the Baojia system, dividing the area into ten districts. The highway from Tingcheng to Liancheng and Longyan is now open, facilitating the transportation of goods. The area within twenty li of the city of Tingzhou is the First District, Xinqiao is the Second District, Caofang is the Third District, Hetian is the Fourth District, Zhuotian is the Fifth District, Gucheng is the Sixth District, Zhangdi is the Seventh District, Sibao is the Eighth District, Zhongwucun is the Ninth District, and Nanyang is the Tenth District. Lin Sixian, the Magistrate of Changting County, concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Clearing and Aftermath Committee, and Liao Difu, Huang Zichao, and Huang Jingzhai were elected as standing committee members of the committee. Xiao Shaogeng serves as the Director of Compilation and Investigation, Zhang Yangjing serves as the Director of Finance, Peng Yaokun serves as the Director of Construction, and Li Zhongliang serves as the Director of Pacification. Local outstanding individuals were also selected to serve as members of various groups (the 13th).</p>

<p>In the Taosha Jing area on the border of Changshu and Taicang, the home of farmer Cao Zibin was suddenly raided by more than twenty bandits on the night before last. Wielding weapons, they broke down the door and took Cao Zibin hostage, interrogating him about the location of his hidden silver. They also tortured each member of his family, causing serious injuries to six people. They robbed two taels of hidden silver, twelve gold rings, two pairs of gold bracelets, two gold hairpins, and soft clothes, totaling a loss of over 4,000 yuan. After the robbery, they fled west, shouting. By the time the nearby military police arrived, the bandits had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Wang Guiqing Poison Pill Case Adjudicated</h3>
<p>On September 5th of last year, the Supervisory Office of the County Public Security Bureau discovered Chen Shaokun and his wife, Chen Zhu, selling poison pills at No. 9 Nanyang Lane. Upon detailed interrogation, they confessed that the poison pills they sold were purchased from Wang Guiqing, a resident of No. 3 Silangjun Temple Lane in the city. The Supervisory Office then dispatched officers to search Wang's residence and discovered 109,000 poison pills in the backyard of Wang's residence. They also found pill-making equipment in the Xue residence across the street. Wang's wife, Hu, and related individuals, including Hu Qiu, Yang Axue, Yang Shi, Chen Yang, and Wu Xinke, were taken to the bureau and transferred to the county government, then transferred to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. The criminals have now been separately sentenced by the military law office of the headquarters, and a request has been submitted to the Nanchang camp for approval. Due to the crowding of prisoners, the eight people, including the former Chen Shaokun, were sent back to the county government of this county yesterday for detention, pending approval for execution. The main criminal, Wang Guiqing, is still to be strictly arrested and brought to justice. It is said that none of the convicted criminals were sentenced to death, but all were given fixed-term imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Changshu Labor Relief Dredging to Commence</h3>
<p>This county suffered a severe drought last summer, and now that winter has arrived, famine riots have repeatedly occurred in various rural areas, demanding winter relief. As the county government has no dedicated funds, the County Administrative Council decided to organize a labor relief dredging project to dredge the city rivers in various rural areas to facilitate transportation and provide work relief. The county government has made every effort to plan and establish a project office, with the county magistrate serving as the director and the district chiefs serving as the deputy directors. Supervisors will be hired by the employees of each district. As for the labor recruitment method, thirty people will form a platoon, ten platoons will form a group, and three groups will form a team, with platoon, group, and team leaders appointed by the township heads, with appropriate subsidies. The project is planned for three months, and in addition to the 10,000 yuan approved by the provincial government, the shortfall will be raised locally. The measures have now been submitted by the county government to the Construction Department for approval. Once approved, work can begin, which is expected to be in late this month.</p>

<p>Borrowed from the Bank of China and Other Banks at 1% Weekly Interest</p>
<p>Contract to be Signed After Agreement, Loan to be Released on the 25th</p>
<p>Xin Xin News reports: The Zhejiang Provincial Government is mortgaging local public debt to Shanghai banking circles for a loan. As a result of Finance Director Xu Qingfu's negotiations in Shanghai, the banking community has agreed to lend 2 million yuan first, which will be undertaken by a syndicate of fourteen banks, including the Bank of China. A meeting was held on the third floor of the Bank of China yesterday morning, and the draft loan contract was decided. Xu took it back to the provincial government for reporting last night. Once passed, it can be formally signed in Shanghai, and the loan will be released on the 25th of this month, to be repaid in five years. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government urgently needs to carry out various work relief construction and debt restructuring projects. In addition, the drought last year sharply reduced tax revenue, and the province is facing financial difficulties. It was decided to pledge 10 million yuan of local public debt issued in 1934 to Shanghai banking circles for 6 million yuan in cash for application. Finance Director Xu Qingfu was sent to Shanghai to conduct negotiations. Since arriving in Shanghai last week, Xu has held consultations with leaders of various banks and hosted a banquet for the banking community to discuss the matter as a whole. As a result of the discussions, the banks felt that the Lunar New Year was approaching, and it was difficult to accept the full amount of 6 million yuan, so they unanimously voted to temporarily borrow 2 million yuan, with the remaining 4 million yuan to be discussed later. After the amount was decided by both parties, it was decided to hold a meeting yesterday to discuss the loan contract.</p>
<h3>Meeting Discussion</h3>
<p>At 10 AM yesterday morning, Xu invited representatives of various lending banks to hold a formal meeting in the conference room of the General Management Office on the third floor of the Bank of China to discuss the loan contract. Those present included Chen Muhao, Manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China; Jin Runquan, Manager of the Hangzhou branch; Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications; Yang Jiemei of the Shanghai Bank; Ye Fuxiao of the Continental Bank; Hu Bijiang of the Zhongnan Bank; Wang Boyuan of the Siming Bank; Fu Xiaoan of the Bank of Communications; Wu Yunzhai of the Jincheng Bank; Xu Xinliu of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank; Wang Zhihua of the Xinhua Bank; Li Fuxun of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank; and Xu Qingfu, Director of Finance of Zhejiang, and others, totaling more than ten people. After Xu Qingfu, as chairman, explained everything, they immediately began to discuss the contract clauses, and the meeting adjourned at 12 noon.</p>
<h3>Contract Highlights</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News reporters learned that as a result of yesterday's meeting, all the clauses of the contract have been fully agreed upon. The various measures are roughly the same as the previous 3 million loan. The key points are: (1) The total mortgage amount is 2 million yuan; (2) The guarantee fund includes Zhejiang Province's business tax, land tax, and brokerage tax; (3) The interest rate is 1% per week; (4) The term is five years, with the principal and interest fully repaid by the end of 1939; (5) The principal and interest will be repaid twice a year, at the end of June and the end of December. The detailed clauses will be announced after the formal signing.</p>
<p>Organization of Banking Syndicate: The loan is being undertaken by fourteen banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Siming Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Continental Bank, Yanyeh Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Bank of Communications, Xinhua Bank, Guohua Bank, and Guohuo Bank. The amount borrowed by each bank is the same as the previous loan distribution. For the convenience of payment, the banks have specially organized a banking syndicate to handle it, and the Bank of China has been designated as the representative of the banking syndicate, responsible for presiding over all matters such as payment.</p>
<p>Xu Returns to Hangzhou: Finance Director Xu Qingfu took the draft contract on the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train back to Hangzhou at 5 PM yesterday, after successfully negotiating the loan contract in Shanghai, to report the progress to the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Once approved by the provincial government, he will return to Shanghai to distribute the contract to the banks for formal signing. It is reported that the lending banks have decided that the Zhejiang Provincial Government urgently needs to use the loan, and it has now been decided to transfer the loan to the Bank of China, the representative of the banking syndicate, on the 25th of this month, and then the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China will transfer it to the Zhejiang Finance Department for application.</p>
<h3>Five Exchanges Sent Representatives to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Participate in Finance and Economics Conferences</p>
<p>Shiye News reports: The Ministry of Finance has decided to start collecting exchange taxes from February 1st. The five exchanges in Shanghai, including the gold industry, have repeatedly requested the central government to abolish the tax because they cannot bear the burden. In order to protect commerce, the central government specially requested the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan to review the exchange tax rate. It is reported that the two committees are scheduled to meet today. After receiving the news, the five exchanges in Shanghai jointly recommended ten representatives to go to Nanjing by overnight express train yesterday to participate in the meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives of Five Exchanges Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Since the five exchanges in Shanghai, including the gold industry, cotton cloth, securities, flour, and miscellaneous grains, jointly telegraphed the central government to abolish the exchange tax, the central government has approved the request of the Shanghai exchanges to send representatives to participate in the joint meeting of the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the 19th (today). The exchanges in Shanghai recommended two representatives each: Xu Busun, Chairman of the Gold Industry Exchange; Zhan Liansheng, of the Broker Association; Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Cotton Cloth Exchange; Bian Futang, of the Broker Association; Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Securities Exchange; Wang Zhengruo, of the Broker Association; Wang Yiting, Chairman of the Flour Exchange; Zhang Weiyun, of the Broker Association; and Gu Xinyi, of the Miscellaneous Grains Exchange, totaling ten people, who jointly went to Nanjing by overnight express train last night.</p>
<h3>Securities Requests Exemption from Taxation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange believes that although the Ministry of Finance's collection of exchange taxes applies to the Shanghai exchanges in general, all of the exchange's usual operations involve government bonds, which are close to physical trading, and should not be taxed in the same way as other exchanges. It specifically telegraphed the Central Political Consultative Conference in Nanjing, the National Government, and various ministries and departments, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, requesting exemption from taxation to maintain commerce. The original petition stated: (Titles omitted) Respectful Greetings,</p>
<h3>Polish Rejection of Chinese Goods: Chamber of Commerce Cables for External Intervention</h3>
<p>Chinese Goods Transported to Poland Should Receive the Same Treatment as Other Countries</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, according to a letter from Wu Zemin, a merchant residing in Poland, he has been living in Poland for many years, engaged in the business of selling retail goods. Previously, the hand-woven straw baskets of our country were quite popular among the Polish people. In the winter of 1933, he entrusted Shanghai Xinda Li to purchase two boxes, totaling one hundred and eighty-two sets, valued at over 170 silver dollars, to be transported to Poland for sale. However, after arriving at the port, the customs officials of that country, disregarding international credibility, arbitrarily raised tariffs. Each set of three straw baskets, with a cost price of less than one Chinese currency dollar, was taxed three times that amount. According to the original Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty, Chinese goods transported to Poland should be taxed according to the most-favored-nation treatment. However, the tax levied on straw baskets transported from Czechoslovakia to Poland is less than eighty percent of their value. The difference is vast. Their violation of the commercial treaty and disregard for national rights are evident. After repeated petitions to diplomatic officials and local lawyers to argue reasonably, it was to no avail, as that country intentionally excludes Chinese goods, turning a deaf ear to all appeals, ultimately making it impossible to import and allowing them to be confiscated. The loss to the individual merchant is minimal and not worth mentioning. However, considering the decline of our national power and the various abuses suffered by overseas Chinese in their host countries, as well as the arbitrary exclusion of Chinese goods, the number of such cases is countless. The reason why they endure humiliation and do not report their plight to fellow Chinese is that they lack sufficient understanding of the domestic situation. There are few who can accurately convey their experiences, causing the suffering of overseas Chinese to be buried without being heard, and the sales of domestic goods to become increasingly sluggish. Now that the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty is about to be revised, we earnestly hope that our government and people of society will rise up and strive to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, so as to safeguard national rights and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The overseas Chinese would be very grateful," etc.</p>
<p>The Chamber also stated, "Our country and Poland have long established a treaty of amity and commerce. Goods from that country entering China are taxed in accordance with the most-favored-nation treatment, the same as other countries. Why is there differential treatment for the export of Chinese goods to their country? Chinese merchants operating in Europe not only have small capital and weak foundations, but also face long journeys, completely different languages and customs, making it difficult for them to gain access. Their situation is different from that in North America and the South Seas Islands. If this overseas Chinese merchant has been traveling to Poland for many years and can purchase goods from China for sale, it is a groundbreaking event in the history of foreign trade. Such nascent businesses should be carefully protected. We cannot remain silent because the amounts are small, allowing the customs officials of that country to continue their old ways, causing Chinese goods to disappear from there altogether. We should ask your Ministry to argue reasonably to ensure that the commercial activities of this overseas Chinese merchant in Poland and the future transportation routes for Chinese goods to Poland will not be obstructed. This is in the public interest. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully petitions, Xiao."</p>
<p>Previously, there was a proposal by the Ministry of Finance to levy a transaction tax. We have already presented the situation and appealed for consideration of the merchants' difficulties, requesting the immediate withdrawal of the tax proposal. Recently, it has been reported that the tax proposal has been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan for review by the Finance and Economic Committee. Upon hearing this news, the public is anxious. We believe that while the collection of transaction tax is not without precedent in other countries, it is a first for our country. The economic structures of various countries are different, and the commercial situations vary. Therefore, the tax procedures must be adapted to the circumstances and suit the national conditions. It is not appropriate to force a fit. From the perspective of our country's history, the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Northern Government once promulgated the "Regulations on Exchange Tax" in September of the 15th year of the Republic of China, but it was later abolished due to the change of government. The Ministry of Finance revised and promulgated it in August of the 16th year, but it was never implemented. Later, the Financial Consolidation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance was established and drafted a plan, which was submitted by various exchanges in Shanghai to abolish the "Regulations on Exchange Tax." The Ministry of Finance reluctantly approved a delay in implementation (as stated in the original report of the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan), which proves that the relationship of this case is very important. In recent years, floods, droughts, and banditry have led to rural bankruptcy, urban poverty, industrial and commercial failures, and a lack of savings. After the January 28th Incident, the people were impoverished and resources exhausted, making it even more unsustainable. The government has always been mindful of the people's suffering and granted consideration. However, the current economic situation is deteriorating. Discussing recovery, the timing for imposing exchange tax is not yet ripe. We have always admired our government authorities for considering the people's livelihood and protecting enterprises, and we believe that they will not bear to further burden the people at this time of economic decline. Moreover, transaction tax and exchange tax, one levied on both parties of the transaction and the other levied on the exchange, seem to be two different things on the surface, but in reality, both are operated by brokers. If exchange tax has already been levied and transaction tax is added, the amount will be reduced, transactions will decrease, and the operation of brokers will be directly affected, which will indirectly reduce the collection of exchange tax, forming a chain reaction. Those who seek to increase revenue may not be able to expand revenue. We should ask your councils, the Executive Yuan, and the ministries to continue to approve the original plan of the 16th year for the transaction tax case and postpone the review. Furthermore, the draft "Regulations on Transaction Tax" of the Ministry of Finance is largely based on the revised "Transaction Tax Law" of Japan in April of the 11th year of Taisho. According to the provisions of that law, transactions of goods and transactions of national debt securities are not taxed. Since transactions outside of the goods exchange are not taxed, because the place of purchase and sale is within the exchange, it is used as the reason for taxation. We are deeply afraid that the buyer and seller will regard the exchange as a long journey, the exchange's business will plummet, and the collection of transaction tax will also be greatly affected. This can be asserted. The mission of buying and selling national debt coupons is the expression of the people's trust in the government. The mission of the exchange is to facilitate the circulation of securities on the one hand and to consolidate the country's credit on the other. The situation is completely different from ordinary goods. If the same tax is levied, it is no different from making the people fulfill an obligation that should not be made outside of subscribing to national debts. In terms of sentiment and law, I am afraid that friendly countries will laugh, and as a result, bond stagnation will be brewed, and new bonds will not be easy to promote. The danger is unimaginable. Therefore, the Japanese tax law stipulates that national debt transactions are specifically listed as tax-free. We find that the draft plan of the Ministry of Finance does not specify whether the purchase and sale of national debt coupons should be taxed. We are very worried about comparisons and references. Its currency flow is sufficient to damage national credit and reduce treasury revenue. The exchanges that have just sprouted will be hit hard, and the brokers in the storm will also be difficult to maintain. We should ask your councils, the Executive Yuan, and the ministries to maintain the original plan of the 16th year for the transaction tax case and postpone the review. To sum up, the exchange tax has been implemented for a long time. The securities exchange part pays more than 200,000 yuan in taxes every year. It is not powerless to repay the country. We should ask your councils, the Executive Yuan, and the ministries to consider the great importance of national plan and people's livelihood, and allow the tax case to be reviewed slowly, in order to comply with the feelings and sympathize with the merchants' difficulties. The urgent telegram is pressing, and we are extremely eager to await orders. Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange Broker Association Representatives Wang Zhengruo, Wu Limen, Zhu Anfu respectfully petitions.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Inventory of Cultural Relics from the Palace Museum</h3>
<p>The inventory of cultural relics from the National Beiping Palace Museum stored in Shanghai is proceeding as usual this week. It is reported that the supervisor Committee member Shu Chushi has gone to Beijing on official business and will return to Shanghai next Monday to continue the supervision. It is also reported that a total of seventy-two boxes of porcelain, six boxes of miscellaneous items, two boxes of jade, and two boxes of lacquerware have been inventoried this week. From the beginning to the end of this week, a total of five hundred and seventy-three boxes have been inventoried.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Farmers' Association Asks to Maintain Cotton Futures Trading</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association yesterday submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Reporting on the matter of forwarding a report. According to the Yangsi District Farmers' Association, 'Reporting on the matter of stopping cotton futures trading, which is detrimental to the rural economy. Requesting that it be maintained as usual to reassure the farmers.' Recently, newspapers and dramas reported that a few yarn factories requested the prohibition of cotton futures trading on the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange to alleviate the situation due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn. After reading it, we were deeply surprised. The price of cotton is always determined by the trend of supply and demand. If supply is less than demand, the price will be high; otherwise, it will be low. Moreover, the exchange was originally established to regulate supply and demand and equalize prices. The daily market price must be determined in accordance with the law and cannot be manipulated or monopolized by a few people. This is clear. Cotton is our country's major agricultural product and the farmers' major income. The level of its price is of great importance to the rural economy. Moreover, the price of cotton in our country is the lowest in the world. How can we further depress it to exploit farmers' income and hinder the rural economy? Recently, our government has spared no effort in rescuing farmers and revitalizing the countryside. However, these manufacturers, using losses as an excuse, disregard the government's intentions and listen to alarming words, insisting on depressing cotton prices to achieve their selfish goals. If trading is stopped, goods will be blocked, the economy will be cut off, and the farmers will suffer. How can this be tolerated? We feel uneasy and cannot remain silent. We should submit a document to your council for review and approval, and then forward it to the competent Yuan and Ministry to instruct the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange to maintain cotton futures trading as usual to reassure the farmers. This is in the public interest." Based on this, we believe that the standard of cotton price should be based on the amount of supply and demand, which is of great importance to the farmers' economy, and cannot be monopolized for the benefit of a few manufacturers. According to the previous report, we should prepare a document to forward it. We look forward to your review and forwarding, as this is in the public interest.</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation Submits to Various Organizations, Striving for Extension of the Liquidation Period</h3>
<p>Stating That Without Postponing Rent Payments, Bankruptcies Are Inevitable</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation cabled to the following organizations yesterday to address the city's economic problems: the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party in Nanjing, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession, the Shanghai Banking Association, and various other organizations and groups, stating: "The economic situation in Shanghai is bleak, and the decline of industry and commerce has reached an extreme point. Company failures and liquidations are a daily occurrence. Due to currency tightening, falling prices, unsold goods, high rents, and sluggish finances, nine out of ten are losing money. If rescue measures are not taken, widespread closures are inevitable, and prosperous Shanghai will become a dead city. We are filled with trepidation at the looming crisis. Our Federation, as a group of citizens, has a clearer understanding of the situation. In accordance with our duties, we convened a temporary representative meeting on January 16 to discuss the situation. It was agreed that extraordinary measures should be taken in response to extraordinary events. Extending the liquidation period is essential for recovery, postponing rent payments is essential to avoid bankruptcies, reducing housing taxes is essential to reduce expenses, and levying housing taxes on vacant houses is essential to offset the reduction in housing taxes. We also urge rent reductions. As a result, the following resolutions were made: (A) Extend the period of industrial and commercial liquidation for one year, with interest paid as usual. (1) Issue a declaration. (2) Submit a report to the Party and government agencies for approval. Send letters to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to carry out the project. (B) Submit a report to the Executive Yuan, instructing the Ministry of Finance to allocate loans from the Central Bank to rescue Shanghai's industry and commerce. (C) (1) Submit a report to the Municipal Government and send a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting the levying of housing taxes on vacant houses. (2) Submit a report to the competent authorities to issue an order postponing rent payments for six months. Submit a report to the Municipal Government and send a letter to the Taxpayers' Association to reduce housing taxes. This is recorded in the file. This matter concerns the rise and fall of Shanghai's economy. Therefore, we send a telegram requesting investigation and implementation. Three and a half million Shanghai citizens depend on it. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation respectfully petitions, Hao."</p>

<h3>Ye Jiaxing, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Federation, Discusses Countermeasures to Revive the Economy</h3>
<p>Plant Liquidations Due to Rural Bankruptcy and Sharp Decline in Purchasing Power</p>
<p>From Industry Solidarity to Avoid Speculation</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reported: "The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation recently issued a declaration on reviving the economy, advocating for a one-year extension of industrial and commercial liquidation, with interest paid as usual, and postponement of rent payments, etc. This has attracted attention from people in society. Ye Jiaxing, a standing committee member of the Federation, expressed his views to a reporter from the New Voice Agency yesterday, stating that although he attended the Federation's standing committee meeting the other day, the agenda was to discuss the articles of association. The issue of reviving the economy was not specifically addressed. Later, he left due to other matters. Regarding this issue, he deeply believes that the decline of commerce and the economic downturn throughout the country are due to rural bankruptcy and the sharp decline in people's purchasing power. The floods in the north and droughts in the south last year exacerbated the severity of the symptoms, just like a person suffering from phlegm who is also suffering from an external infection. For the present plan, he believes that the only way is to do our best to revive the rural areas, increase the people's purchasing power, so that various domestic products can be sold smoothly, and to open up international trade places, so that there can be a way out for foreign countries. This is the fundamental remedy for reviving the national economy. As for the decline of the city's economy and the decline of commerce, in addition to the above reasons, there are other factors. One of them is that the same industry is fighting each other and destroying each other. For example, in the rubber industry a few years ago, there were only seven or eight rubber factories in the city, and their business was very good and they were all able to make profits. However, in the past one or two years, the establishment of rubber factories has mushroomed, increasing to forty or fifty. As a result, the factories are fighting each other and competing by lowering prices. There is no spirit of unity among the same industry, and they are doing their best to commit suicide. This is the case in the rubber industry, and other industries are also the same. No wonder the market is in decline. Furthermore, several large stores in the city have recently gone bankrupt. The reason for their bankruptcy is not the failure of the store's own business, but its concurrent operation of businesses other than the store's business. The recent bankruptcy of Tai Company is a clear example of this. Secondly, the managers of stores in the city often use their managerial position to engage in speculative activities privately. The lucky ones create personal wealth, but the stores themselves do not benefit. The unlucky ones often cannot make ends meet and move the store's money without authorization, causing the store to run aground or go bankrupt. There are many such things. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that the business community in the city can strive to unite the same industry, avoid operating foreign businesses and speculative businesses, and then the revival of the economy will be greatly assisted. Furthermore, last year all industries have declared liquidation. It is expected that after the summary relief, there will be a new innovative and emerging business. Recalling that the Civil Code drafted by the Legislative Yuan had a draft for joint shops to be jointly and severally liable, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has strived for the amendment of the Commercial Registration Law to supplement it. This registration law is extremely important for emerging joint stores. I hope that the legislative authorities will promulgate it as soon as possible to benefit the city's commerce."</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Denies Tension in Chahar</h3>
<p>The New Voice Agency reported: "Regarding reports that the situation in Chahar is becoming tense again, the Japanese Embassy here stated that they have not heard anything about it. However, after reading the newspaper, they have already telegraphed Tokyo to inquire. The embassy does not have definite proof until it receives the subsequent telegram. However, they stated that they had asked Suzuki, the embassy's military attaché, who had not heard anything about it either. He also believed that there was no possibility of a tense situation arising between China and Japan in Chahar, unless there were a few remnants of bandits appearing there, but bandits are not a concern and cannot cause a tense situation. Therefore, based on this theory, they believe that the claim that the situation in Chahar is tense is a rumor from the outside. However, the telegram stated that Xiao Zhenying's inspection of eastern Chahar showed that the Japanese troops had no activity, but were quite active. It is not possible to prove whether the Japanese Embassy really had not heard anything about it."</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Claims Hirota Has No Intention of Coming to China</h3>
<p>Unable to Spare Time for the March Parliament</p>
<p>Arita to Stay in Shanghai, Not to Travel Elsewhere</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reported: "Yesterday's newspaper reported that Japan, feeling diplomatically isolated after withdrawing from the League of Nations and abolishing the Washington Treaty, will not hesitate to have Foreign Minister Hirota himself come to China to meet with our government authorities to repair Sino-Japanese relations and open up the past Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation. A reporter from the New Voice Agency visited the Japanese Consulate in this port regarding this matter. According to Iwai, this statement is not entirely true. The Japanese Parliament on the 20th of March will be held as scheduled. Before and after the parliament is held, it is very busy and cannot leave for far. Moreover, from the perspective of recent Sino-Japanese diplomacy, Foreign Minister Hirota does not seem to have a need to come to China. As for the claim that Foreign Minister Hirota has instructed Consul Suma to convey his intention to Minister Arita to conduct talks with the Chinese government, I am afraid that this is also not the case. Suma went to Beijing by night train the day before yesterday (17th) to discuss commercial issues with the diplomatic authorities of the Nanjing government, and there were no other discussions. Minister Arita will stay in Shanghai recently and will not travel elsewhere for a while."</p>
<h3>The Urgent Relief Universal Donation Association Sends a Letter Requesting Continued Fundraising</h3>
<p>Second Phase Settlement at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Urgent Relief Universal Donation Association received numerous letters and telegrams from various provinces and regions, stating that the drought and gambling disasters were extremely severe, and requested that more funds be raised for relief. The association was originally scheduled to end at the end of the month, but the disaster area is vast and the aid is only a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. At the second meeting the other day, it was decided to continue operating and work hard to raise funds from all parties, hoping to obtain large amounts of money to provide universal relief to the victims. This has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. To facilitate people from all walks of life to donate to the Universal Donation, the association entrusted newspapers, banks, money shops, companies, shops, movie theaters, amusement venues, Chinese and Western pharmacies, silk shops, restaurants, photo studios, car dealerships, etc. to collect universal donations on its behalf. Since its implementation, it has been enthusiastically carried out by various stores, and the results have been remarkable. The first phase of the settlement of donations to the association has been very enthusiastic. It is reported that the association yesterday sent letters to various newspapers, banks, etc., requesting that they continue to operate and extend the period. The donations received will be settled in the second phase at the end of this month and submitted to the association first for distribution to the disaster areas.</p>
<p>The association received 50 yuan from the Duck Slaughtering Industry Association yesterday, 4 yuan from the Da Lai Automobile Company, 3 yuan and 61 cents in small bills from Tang Yan Elementary School.

<h3>Declaration of the Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union</h3>
<p>In 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army established its presence in Beijing and Shanghai and the mass movement swept the country, our newspaper workers, on the one hand, were wary of our own disunity and lack of organization, and on the other hand, felt that the National Revolution was a revolution of the entire people, and everyone had the right and opportunity to participate in politics. The members of our association, based on the above two reasons, organized this association. Over the years, we have been working with the sincerity and unity of our workers and the principle of labor-capital harmony, striving to increase the status of workers themselves, improve their living conditions, improve their work skills, cultivate the spirit of autonomy, and create workers' spare time schools, so that the children of workers can have the opportunity to attend school. All of these are the consistent propositions of our association, which we have never forgotten.</p>
<p>Since the foreign invasion of September 18, the fall of the Eastern Provinces, the decline of national consciousness throughout the country, and the people's awareness of the urgent need for national disaster, fortunately, the sincerity and unity of the comrades in the central government, their composure and prudence, and their comprehensive plan to deal with the national disaster, the first step must be to settle the internal affairs, and to settle the internal affairs must first eliminate the Communist Party. The recent suppression of the communist bandits in Jiangxi, although it is due to the collapse of the communist theory itself, which is not suitable for China, is also due to the divine wisdom of Chiang Kai-shek and the use of the generals, which has led to the increasingly stable central government, the daily progress of national consciousness, and the hope for the revival of the Chinese nation. The members of our association, adhering to the Three People's Principles, have never forgotten their responsibility to save the country and save the nation. Following the central government's intentions, under the leadership of the Three People's Principles and Chiang Kai-shek, they are working hard to fulfill their responsibility to save the national China. Therefore, at the beginning of the 16th session of the Executive Committee of our association, we hereby announce the propositions of our association, hoping that all sectors will take note of them. Hereby declare, Shanghai Newspaper Workers' Union, January 18, 1935.</p>
<h3>Machine Association Petitioned Yesterday, Demanding Two Points</h3>
<p>French Concession Taxpayers' Association Decides to Hold a Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Before the negotiations on the inspection of factories in the concession are resolved, the French Concession Public Works Department hastily formulated regulations on the management of steam engines, arbitrarily carrying out inspections of factories in the concession, and yesterday issued a notice refusing any organization's investigation (see the advertising column). Its infringement on our country's sovereignty is so great that it disregards everything. The Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, based on the resolution of the 8th second meeting of representatives, and the police department's notice that factories in the French Concession, except for inspections by the French authorities, any organization or individual is ordered to refuse, infringing on our country's sovereignty, expressed its vow to oppose it. Therefore, at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, representatives Cheng Shouchong and Gu Xiyuan went to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to petition, requesting (1) the management regulations to be suspended, and (2) a re-submission for review. After arriving at the Taxpayers' Association, the Chinese commissioner Cheng Zhuqiu received them. Regarding the representatives' two requests, he expressed acceptance and promised to convene a special meeting of all Chinese directors and commissioners on Monday (21st) afternoon to discuss this matter specifically in order to protect sovereignty. At the same time, it was decided to submit the police department's notification to the meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Discusses the Resolution of the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Route Dispute</h3>
<p>The Mingxing Steamer will Initiate Scheduled Service, Temporarily Replacing Xin Jiangtian</p>
<p>An Open Invitation for All Sectors to Visit is Scheduled for the 21st</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: The Sanbei Company is the agent for the Mingxing Steamer operating on the Zhenhai route, also serving Wanning and Ningbo. Subsequently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ningshao Company separately submitted letters to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, requesting the Bureau to suspend the Mingxing Steamer's route permit. The Bureau forwarded these letters to the Sanbei Company, instructing them to respond to the issues raised. Later, Director Peng of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau invited key personnel from the three companies to a meeting at the Bureau on the 12th of this month to discuss a resolution to this matter. As no announcement was made, people from all walks of life are quite concerned. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specifically visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, General Manager of the Sanbei Company, at the company yesterday to inquire about the matter. Mr. Yu was gracious enough to grant an interview and informed the reporter as follows: On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, I (referring to himself) attended a meeting at the invitation of Director Peng of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau. Present were Mr. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Mr. Yuan Fudeng, Manager of the Ningshao Company. I asked Director Peng whether the meeting would discuss the suspension of the route permit. Director Peng replied that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss cooperation methods among the three companies, not the suspension of the route permit. I then asked the representatives from China Merchants and Ningshao whether they had seen the Sanbei Company's response to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and whether there were any discrepancies that they wished to discuss. Both representatives acknowledged that the facts stated in the Sanbei Company's response were accurate. I then stated that since both of them recognized that the Sanbei Company had a legitimate case, the petition was reasonable. In advanced shipping nations, route permits are only categorized into three types: ocean-going, coastal, and river. There is no restriction like this, and there is no reason to withhold a route permit based on the government's will. Mr. Liu then stated that he had discussed the matter with Minister Zhu, and that during the preparation period for cooperation, if the Mingxing Steamer insisted on sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo, the route permit would have to be suspended. I replied that the Mingxing Steamer sailing between Shanghai and Zhenhai, also serving Wanning and Ningbo, was solely for the purpose of aiding the rural areas and facilitating transportation. I had repeatedly stated that I was willing to sacrifice profits for the sake of this cause and that I embraced the principle of sacrifice. Furthermore, I did not understand which laws or regulations this violated. Was it that if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had ships sailing on a route, it should be restricted for others? Even if our (referring to the government) thought we were violating the law, and the company went bankrupt as a result, we would accept it. Moreover, to take a step back, even if the Maritime Affairs Bureau granted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wish and suspended the Mingxing's Shanghai-Ningbo route permit, the Sanbei Company could simply park the Mingxing Steamer indefinitely and wait for a fair resolution. Of the other ships in the company's fleet, approximately twenty have permits for the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and it would not be impossible to dispatch one of them to operate the route. Would the Maritime Affairs Bureau revoke all of these route permits as well? Director Peng then reiterated the earlier remarks about cooperation. I was extremely supportive of cooperation, especially since the Mingxing's service to Shanghai-Zhenhai, also serving Wanning-Ningbo, was primarily for rural relief and not for profit. Therefore, if the abolition of transshipment taxes on local goods transported by Chinese ships to treaty ports were achieved, or if a Yangtze River cooperation agreement were reached, the Sanbei Company could suspend the Mingxing Steamer's service between Shanghai and Zhenhai. Mr. Liu stated that the Yangtze River cooperation agreement was expected to be finalized within approximately two months. I replied that that would not be too far off. I would be willing to make peaceful concessions to the extent possible without compromising the principle of rural relief. Mr. Liu then suggested whether the four companies operating between Shanghai and Ningbo could meet again to discuss the matter. I expressed my support, and we went together to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, also inviting representatives from Jardine Matheson to the meeting. It was agreed that the cooperation agreement among the four companies operating between Shanghai and Ningbo would continue, while the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would be responsible for signing the Yangtze River cooperation agreement within two months. Starting from the 22nd of this month, the Mingxing Steamer would temporarily replace the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian Steamer for one month. After that, it would replace the Ningshao Company's Xin Ningshao Steamer for another month. If the Yangtze River cooperation agreement was still not finalized after two months, the Sanbei Company would operate the route on its own until the date when the transshipment tax on local goods was abolished, at which point it would switch to operating on the Yangtze River. During the period of substituting for the China Merchants and Ningshao companies, the profits and losses would be borne by each respective company, while the Sanbei Company would only collect rent for the ship. All the ship's crew, staff in the operations department, and cabin attendants would be appointed by the Sanbei Company and could not be changed. The Ningshao Company's Xin Ningshao, serving both Wan and Zhenhai, would dock at the Sanbei Wharf as a resolution. The reporter then asked Mr. Yu that he had been told about the huge relationship with the Shanghai-Zhenhai route, and the rural villages saved; were there any other major relationships, that could be revealed? Qing replied that there were three other points in addition to helping the rural areas by operating the Shanghai-Zhenhai route: First, to reduce the burden of local goods; second, to save time for small passengers; and third, that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was about to be completed, so that goods from Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces could be exported from Zhenhai. Therefore, based on these three points, his company was willing to sacrifice everything. It was inappropriate for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to oppose this. It was also learned that the Mingxing Steamer was scheduled to begin operating on the Xin Jiangtian Steamer's schedule on the 22nd of this month. On the previous day, at 11:00 AM, the Sanbei Company would host a tour of the ship at the Jinliyuan Ningbo Wharf for people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee Reports that an Entire Family in Haining Died by Suicide</h3>
<p>Hoping That All Sectors Will Quickly Offer Assistance</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yusan, a doctor of political science and sociology who recently arrived in Shanghai from a place, visited the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee on Renji Road yesterday and personally reported that near Haining, a family of seven, including the husband, wife, and children, had suffered from a drought and consumed all their food and pawned their belongings. They had been unable to cook for three days. A neighbor woman, unable to bear the sight, shared several liters of rice to provide immediate relief. However, when her husband returned, he said that this little amount was not enough even for their own needs, let alone sharing with others. What would their family live on? They quarreled, and the sound reached outside. The famine-stricken family heard this and returned the rice. Another neighbor, learning of the situation and seeing the husband and wife groaning in pain, generously lent them one dollar that had been saved in the tattered quilt, hoping to save their entire family. Unexpectedly, although the famine-stricken family had obtained this dollar, they felt that they could not survive in this environment. They were seized by a fleeting idea. They purchased two jiao of broken rice and eight jiao of sodium nitrate, cooked porridge, and all seven members of the family consumed it, resulting in their deaths. The tragedy filled the village, shocking everyone. Dr. Wang also stated that there were still 1,500 households in Haining that could be saved. The provincial relief funds were limited and could not provide timely assistance. Providing relief at a rate of 200 yuan per day would cost only 6,000 yuan for a month and could save a significant number of lives. It was said that the committee had been providing emergency relief to Haining and had repeatedly increased its funding, coordinating with the Jisheng Association to distribute the funds. It had just been completed, yet such a tragedy had occurred. This showed that the disaster was severe, and the relief funds were insufficient to provide a thorough solution. It was hoped that all sectors would quickly offer assistance, as the weather was cold and freezing, making this a timely and virtuous act.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Association Takes Over Emergency Relief in Haiyan</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association has completed its emergency relief efforts in Haining and is now taking over relief efforts in Haiyan. With the weather cold and freezing, and disaster victims everywhere, the limited amount of relief funds and clothing is difficult to distribute to everyone. The amount of porridge is meager, and there are too many monks, making it unavoidable that some will be left empty-handed. In the blink of an eye, spring will arrive, and there will be a shortage of food. Considering the situation in the nearby Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the severity of the disaster areas and the large number of disaster victims, without food or clothing, how can they survive? Life is hanging by a thread. Moreover, how can they sow the seeds and have hope for spring plowing? The cries of the hungry are unbearable all day long. Those who have children can flee to other places, and these are the people who are able to survive. The dead are gone and cannot speak. At this time of extreme anxiety and before it is too late, people of society should save the money spent on Spring Festival banquets and use it for disaster relief. In this way, disaster victims will benefit greatly, and it is particularly hoped that charitable comrades will do this.</p>
<h3>The Moral Society Goes to Jurong for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: The Chinese Moral Society believes that the drought in Jurong, Jintan, and Danyang counties in the year of Jiaxu was severe, and the autumn harvest was completely lost. Now that it is the middle of winter, there are cries of hunger everywhere, and people are waiting to be fed. Therefore, it was decided to send personnel to the three places to investigate and provide disaster relief. Fu Yiting, the head of investigation and relief, and Wan Desheng, the investigator and relief worker, have already been assigned and departed yesterday afternoon, starting with Jurong and providing relief according to the severity of the disaster.</p>
<h3>A Western Employee of Jardine Matheson Forces a Chinese Worker to Death, the National Seamen's Union Offers Support</h3>
<p>Tian Hou, a Chinese worker in the middle cabin of the Xianghe Steamer of Jardine Matheson, missed the ship in Shanghai. He boarded the Longhe Steamer to pursue it to Beijing. He was forced to disembark at Xiaguan. By the time he got to Xiaguan, the Xianghe had already set sail. Therefore, he still boarded the Longhe Steamer going upstream. When the worker boarded the steamer in Shanghai, he originally paid 1 yuan and 1 jiao to purchase a half-price ticket. The second time he boarded the steamer from Beijing, he could not buy a ticket because he had no money. A Western ticket checker, Niumen, discovered this. Although Tian stated the reason, the Westerner not only did not show consideration to a fellow seamen in the same company, but also violently beat him and insulted him in every way, firmly demanding that he buy a ticket. Tian was forced to jump into the river to commit suicide. When all the passengers on the ship saw this, they were greatly angered and immediately ordered the captain to stop the ship and retrieve him, but he was already barely breathing. By the time they arrived at Wuhu, he had already died. An autopsy was performed in Wuhu. The results showed that Tian had drowned due to injuries sustained before death. This case has now aroused the indignation of seamen all over the country, who are determined to unite and provide assistance. A committee has been organized to handle the negotiations. The Chinese Seamen's Union has been receiving messages from seamen's organizations all over the country, stating that the facts of this case are not only about the abuse of Chinese workers, but also involve international indignation. They are currently conducting a detailed investigation and collecting evidence. Once the matter is settled, they will seriously lodge a protest.</p>
<h3>The Tobacco Merchants' Association Appeals on Behalf of its Members</h3>
<p>That the Original Tax Should Not Be Increased</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association has repeatedly received reports from its members, such as Wan Mao Xiang and other shops, that after they paid the tax for the Spring cigarette licenses, officials from the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office were sent to investigate and planned to levy an additional level of tax. At a time when the market is sluggish, business is declining, and many shops are closing, we are already finding it difficult to maintain our business by paying taxes at the original rate, and we are unable to pay any additional taxes. Therefore, we request that you forward our request to the authorities to maintain the original rate. The association submitted a letter to Director Cai of the Finance Bureau yesterday, stating: "Submitting a request to forward our request, we respectfully request your bureau to consider the difficulties faced by merchants, send personnel to reinvestigate, and order the office to maintain the original rate and refrain from increasing it. The association has received statements from fifteen tobacco shops, including Wan Mao Xiang, stating that the level of their licenses for both the autumn and winter quarters have been successively increased. Recently, tax officials have again visited their shops, instructing them to increase the rate for the spring quarter as well. Merchants are hoping to reduce their burdens and maintain their livelihoods during this time of sluggish market conditions and declining business. If the rate is increased again, they will be unable to afford it. If business can be developed, they will naturally comply with the order to increase the rate. Please ask the association to forward their plea to the Tax Bureau to grant them consideration and allow them to pay taxes at the original rate in order to maintain their livelihoods. We have carefully investigated each shop and confirmed that the statements they have made are true. We hereby forward their requests in detail, respectfully requesting your office to review and approve, consider the difficulties faced by merchants, send personnel to reinvestigate according to the list, and instruct the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office to allow the shops listed to maintain the original rate and refrain from increasing it. We also request your approval so that we can inform them. We would be eternally grateful." The letter to Director Liang of the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office is similar.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Li Weiyuan Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Li Weiyuan, a translator at the North Sichuan Road Police Station of the Public Security Bureau's North Station Branch, was fluent in English and Japanese and possessed diplomatic skills. He handled foreign-related incidents with exceptional decorum and was highly valued by his superiors. Tragically, he passed away from overwork on December 31st of last year at Fumin Hospital. Liang Fuchu, the director of the North Station Branch, and the directors of all the police stations under his jurisdiction, in recognition of Mr. Li's contributions, have specially requested permission to hold a memorial service at the Guangdong Hospital at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month to honor his loyalty and diligence. It is said that Mayor Wu, Director Wen, and Japanese officials and residents living in Shanghai have all sent eulogies to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Steamer, the Hakushin Maru, Collides with a Coal Boat</h3>
<p>The Boatmen's Association Submits a Request to the Maritime Affairs Bureau for Compensation</p>
<p>Barge No. 12169 of the Zhu Xianji Barge Company in this port, carrying 50 tons of Hongqi coal, was being towed by the Longxing tugboat at approximately 4:00 PM on January 15th, passing through the Dongjiadu Middle Pier on the Puxi side. At that time, the Hakushin Maru, a steamer belonging to the Dalian Steamship Company of Japan, was turning its head to exit the harbor, piloted by the Nanyang tugboat. The hull of the steamer was obstructing the center of the harbor. Suddenly, the steamer reversed. The stern of the steamer crashed into the Puxi side. The Longxing tugboat repeatedly sounded its whistle as a warning, but the Hakushin Maru continued to reverse. The steamer collided with the coal boat in the middle, causing the cargo and boat to sink completely, resulting in a huge loss. The owner of the barge, Zhu Xianrui, has reported this to the Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association of this city for assistance. The association, upon receiving the report, has submitted a request to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation for filing. They will send personnel to inspect the damage and negotiate with the Dalian Steamship Company for compensation.</p>

<h3>Lu Xihou Returns to Prison</h3>
<p>Whether There is a Relationship with the Jai Alai Stadium Needs to Be Investigated</p>
<p>The Civil Court Believes That There is a Need for Custody</p>
<p>Lu Xihou, Chairman of the China Industrial Bank, has been arrested since the bank collapsed. After several court hearings, the court, in order to protect the interests of creditors, ruled that the trial proceedings for Lu Xihou, Sun Xiren, and Lu Mengxiang should be partially suspended. Lu Xihou was allowed to be released on bail of 20,000 yuan in cash and 30,000 yuan in bonds in order to go out and settle debts. Then, the results of the settlement would be used as a reference for the judgment. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, when Lu was preparing the funds for bail the other day, because he had been subject to civil court liquidation, he accompanied lawyers Fan Gang and Wu Kun to the Civil Division Six for questioning. Judge Yu Changzi opened the court for trial and asked if Lu had invested in the jai alai stadium and the dog racing track. Lu replied that he had no relationship with the jai alai stadium, but he had over a thousand shares in the dog racing track, but they had been pledged to the Siming Bank for 50,000 yuan. The debts he owed to others amounted to approximately 900,000 yuan, while others owed him over 1 million yuan. Although these were old accounts, he could still recover over 100,000 yuan. At the same time, there were 150,000 yuan in pledges from the Siming Bank, 150,000 yuan in advances from the Qunyi Banking Syndicate, and over 100,000 yuan in savings from relatives and friends. If the two were offset, he only owed about 500,000 yuan, so he planned to pay off half of it first, regardless of the size of the account. Judge Yu, after verifying the statement, stated that whether Lu Xihou had any shares in the jai alai stadium was still under investigation, so he ordered that Lu remain in custody. Therefore, Lu Xihou was still unable to regain his freedom.</p>

<h3>Japanese Privately Detain Chinese People</h3>
<p>Due to Disputes Over Cigarette Paper and Ink</p>
<p>Even Threatening to Tie Them Up and Throw Them into the Sea</p>
<p>Chen Shaozhong, a native of Yancheng who claims to be a counselor in the 26th Division of the 43rd Army in Sichuan, age 39, had a dispute with Japanese national Mizuno between March 17th and July of last year over 100 boxes of cigarette paper worth 28,000 yuan and an advance of 2,500 silver yuan for ink that he had handled to Juxingcheng. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 15th of this month, he was taken by the Japanese national Mizuno to the gazebo on the third floor of the Baoki Trading Company, a Japanese business located at No. 7, Lane 24, near the Shanghai Sanatorium on Haining Road. There, he was guarded by the Japanese national Kaida and Zhang Ziren from Suqian, who forced him to hand over the cigarette paper and ink or repay 30,000 yuan in silver dollars. They threatened him with a pistol, saying that if he did not comply, they would tie him up and throw him into the sea to die. Chen was unable to escape until approximately 9:00 PM the night before, when he took advantage of a guard dozing off and wrote a letter with a pencil, adding several copper coins, and threw it out the window. Someone picked it up and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. The police chief, knowing that the house was owned by a Japanese merchant, immediately sent Western Control Officer Whitestone and Chinese Detective Wang Runhe to notify the Japanese Consulate and dispatched Japanese detectives to go to the address and rescue Chen. The Japanese national Kaida and the Chinese Zhang Ziren were arrested and taken back to the police station. Kaida was sent to the Japanese Consulate for investigation, and Zhang was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Ie Zishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated the facts of the case and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 316, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for the crime of obstructing freedom, requesting an adjournment. Chen Shaozhong, the victim, testified to the details of the incident. When the defendant was questioned, he claimed to be a foreman in the oil factory owned by the Japanese and made evasive replies. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered that he remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing to investigate further.</p>
<h3>Black Fever Discovered in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>The Seaport Quarantine Service Prevents Spread</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health Sends Personnel to Diagnose and Treat</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: Recently, the weather has been unfavorable, and various infectious diseases are prone to break out. Recently, cases of black fever have been discovered in the Jiangbei area of Jiangsu Province. There are a considerable number of patients. The National Seaport Quarantine Service is strictly preventing its spread, as it concerns public health. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wu Liande Discusses the State of the Disease</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu Liande, director of the Quarantine Service, speaking to the Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday, the infectious disease discovered in the Jiangbei area of Jiangsu Province is black fever in medicine, known as Black Fever in English. The disease is caused by unhygienic condition. It starts with a slight fever, then the abdomen gradually becomes swollen, as large as a pregnant woman, similar to leprosy, and is extremely contagious. It is prevalent in tropical areas such as Burma and Annam. Cases have also been discovered in Shandong and other provinces in China, but it is not the black death disease reported in the newspaper. The Quarantine Service is strictly preventing its spread.</p>
<p>Set Up Clinics for Timely Treatment</p>
<p>The Jiangbei area is mostly rural, so most of those infected with black fever are farmers.

<h3>The Tragic Story of a Blacklisted Young Woman</h3>
<p>Drifting in Shanghai, Full of Regret</p>
<p>Dying in Poverty and Sickness in a Foreign Land</p>
<p>Cao Ada, a young woman from Kunshan, aged twenty-four, had a habit. She recently became addicted to smoking opium, which caused her to wander around. She was a sluggard all day long. She was originally married to a Wang, who wanted her to quit the addiction. However, she was sent to the hospital several times, and the results were quite the opposite. She intensified and the habit was bigger than before. Wang reluctantly divorced her. This ignorant village woman was addicted to opium and was not tolerated in the family. After leaving the family, she was dissatisfied. She was wandering alone, living under a tower, and she lived a very disappointing life. The other day she went to the Liu graveyard, and she was lying on the ground. It was so very sad. She asked a person on the street to write a letter for her, asking her brother-in-law to take her home. She said her name was Cao Ada, and she said that she regretted going down the wrong path, asking her brother-in-law in Kunshan to come get her. She said to tell them that it was not a lie, because she was sick. She said for him to come quickly because she might not see him again. When she was done, she was in tears, regretting everything. Everyone was surrounding her, and they pitied her. But yesterday morning, someone was looking for Cao Ada and found her dead. It was found that the door was locked, and they notified the local court. They found Cao Ada, who was wearing torn clothes and covered in sores, and she was malnourished and dead. They sent the casket to be found by the family, and later someone was sent to find Cao Zaifeng in Kunshan. They hope that he will bury her.</p>
<h3>Remainder of House Rented Out to Tenant Who Was a Robber</h3>
<p>Happily Opened the Door to Move Belongings In</p>
<p>Pulled Out a Gun and Rummaged Through Chests and Cabinets</p>
<p>Zheng Shengquan, a Ningbo native, 47 years old, residing at No. 1 Jixin Fang, Lane 71, East Zilaihuo Street, in the French Concession, acted as a sub-landlord. He lived in the room behind the living room and rented out the remaining rooms upstairs. Recently, the tenant of the entire three-story building had moved out, so he posted a rental notice at the entrance of the lane. On the 16th in the morning, a man with a local accent came to Zheng's house to rent the room. He inspected the place once but did not commit to anything. However, he had already looked around upstairs and downstairs before leaving. On the 17th in the afternoon, the man came again to view the house. This time, he paid a deposit of one silver dollar, rented the room, and arranged to move in the next day. Yesterday at noon, the man came to Zheng's house again, claiming to be moving his belongings in, and requested the main door to be opened. Zheng's family, suspecting nothing, happily opened the door. Suddenly, three robbers, dressed in long black gowns and speaking in Chongming, Ningbo, and local accents, rushed in. They brandished three handguns, threatening the occupants not to make a sound. The man who had called for the door to be opened also joined the gang. Zheng and his family, seeing the guns, were afraid and dared not make a sound, allowing the robbers to ransack the rooms, rummage through chests and cabinets, and search Zheng himself. They were robbed of clothes, jewelry, and cash worth about 300 yuan in total. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled. Afterward, the victim reported the loss to the French police station and requested an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the police chief dispatched detective Wu Lianrong to investigate the scene and ordered all detectives to strictly apprehend the robbers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Trademark Also Had English Label Stating "Made in Germany"</h3>
<p>A Factory Uncovered on Parker Road</p>
<p>Many People Involved, Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>Wu Hanzhang, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the General Police Station, recently detected that someone was running a red pill factory and secretly selling them at No. 88 Renxin Li, Lane 253, Parker Road. He sent an informant, disguised as a customer, to obtain a sample packet and inquire about the price. Each bag of 1,000 pills sold for $6.50. They agreed to meet the day before yesterday at 4:00 PM to pay $65 for ten bags of red pills, totaling 10,000 pills. The informant reported back to Detective Wu, who informed the First Special Court and obtained a search warrant. They secretly waited outside No. 88 Renxin Li the day before yesterday. At the same time, they sent the informant inside, pretending to buy, and contacted a woman named Xu Yangshi. She instructed him to call her mother, Xu Wushi, at 3247 (i.e., Yi Tai Yong Coal Store, No. 48 Pushi Road, French Concession) to have the goods delivered from the factory. Before long, a Ningbo man named Hu Jinsheng arrived carrying a coal basket. Just as he was about to enter, detectives arrested him outside the door. They found ten bags of red pills, weighing five and a half pounds, hidden in the coal. They then went inside, arrested the two women, and searched the premises but found no further contraband. Based on Hu's confession, they, together with detectives from the French police, went to Yi Tai Yong Coal Store and found 26 pounds of red pills, three taels of powder, two pounds of coffee extract, one red pill press, two baskets, and two cans of red pill dye on top of the firewood. Only a Ningbo woman named Zhang Wangshi was apprehended at the time. Later, Hu Jinsheng confessed that the red pills came from the Shidai Pharmacy at No. 21 Jinshou Li, Shandong Road. Chinese and Western detectives then went to Shidai Pharmacy and arrested Zhang Zinan, a Ningbo native, and his brother Zhang Ziqing (a doctor), who were accomplices. They found 16 pounds of raw materials, five bottles of resin (weighing five and a half pounds), and five cans of caffeic acid under the bed in the back room. All were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, presented the case and stated that the red pills seized had a "Double Lion Horse" trademark and were labeled with English letters stating that the goods were of high quality and made in Germany. He also learned that the person in charge was Liu Chongfa, the manager of Yi Tai Yong Coal Store, who was now on the run. He requested permission to detain the defendants and postpone the hearing. Judge Liu Yugui briefly questioned Xu Yangshi and the other six people. Their statements were mostly evasive. He ordered them to be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guanghua Denies Killing His Younger Brother</h3>
<p>Trial Opened Yesterday, Statements Taken</p>
<p>Further Investigation of the Case Is Necessary</p>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a Henan native, 27 years old, formerly employed by the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, and his 18-year-old younger brother, Zhang Guangzhou, lived together in a third-floor attic room at the home of a Ningbo woman, Dai Chenshi, at No. 24 Chongde Fang, Minguo Road, outside the Xiaobeimen in the French Concession. On November 22 of last year, Zhang Guanghua's employment was terminated, and he informed the sub-landlord that he would vacate the room in five or six days with his brother to return to Henan. That night, the two brothers still slept in the same room. At 5:00 AM the next morning, Zhang Guangzhou was suddenly killed by a knife that severed his neck. Zhang Guanghua also suffered five or six knife wounds to the head at the same time, jumped out of the window shouting for help, and then called to open the window of the attic room on the second floor, where a Haiyan native named Yan Jintao lived. The sub-landlord's relatives, Dan Bingchang and Lin Shengxiang, went out to call the police. The police sent Guanghua to the hospital for treatment and transported Guangzhou's body to the coroner for examination. Since there were no other relatives in Shanghai, the Charity Hall arranged for the burial. Later, after Guanghua recovered from his injuries, the police took him back for a thorough investigation and determined that Guangzhou had indeed been killed by Guanghua. They sent Guanghua to the Second Special Court and filed a public prosecution for murder. On the 8th of this month, Judge Xiong Huiping opened a trial and questioned witnesses Dai Chenshi, Yan Jintao, Dan Bingchang, Lin Shengxiang, and others. Instructions were given to postpone the trial for further investigation, as detailed in the newspaper on the 9th. During the postponement, the presiding judge, Mr. Xiong, personally went to the scene of the incident to survey and inquire about the circumstances at the time. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Judge Xiong and Clerk Tao specially opened the Second Criminal Court for the trial. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang from the Police Department appeared in court. The defendant, Zhang Guanghua, also hired a lawyer to defend him. The defendant's father, Zhang Wenfubu, also came to court to listen. According to Zhang Guanghua's statement, "Our brothers have always had a good relationship." Asked, "How could such a tragedy occur?" He replied, "After being injured, I escaped. I don't know. We turned off the lights at night to sleep. In my sleep, someone used a knife to stab my head. I woke up, got up, and couldn't open the door, so I opened the window and jumped out, shouting for help. This person then stabbed my younger brother." Asked, "Was it your younger brother who stabbed you?" He replied, "It was dark, so I couldn't see clearly. I was sleeping on the bed by the east window, with my feet facing the door. When I slept, my head was covered with a quilt, my right shoulder was down, and my left shoulder was up." At this point, the witnesses were questioned one by one. Their statements were the same as recorded in the previous report. The judge then said to the defendant, "It is now proven that there was no third person in your room. Based on various observations, it is presumed that your brother stabbed you, and you resisted in self-defense, which is reasonable. You also confessed this way when moving out." Zhang replied, "Our brothers have always been harmonious, and he was very obedient to me. If he had disobeyed me, I could have asked him to live elsewhere. How could I have harmed my own brother in this way?" At this point, the judge stated that the case still required detailed investigation and ordered the clerk to read aloud the written records of the statements of each person and sign them. He then announced that the hearing would be postponed to a later date, and the defendant would remain in custody.</p>
<h3>Zhu Liqing Case Opened for Execution Yesterday</h3>
<p>Le Songxiong Has Not Paid Alimony</p>
<p>The Court Will Schedule Another Summons</p>
<p>Zhu Liqing, a young woman from Nanjing, resided at No. 30 Datong Li, Yaozhujiao Road, in the French Concession. She had received a higher education and was well-versed in both Chinese and Western knowledge. In the spring of 1930, she was hired as an English teacher by Le Zhenbao, a Ningbo native who owned the Taichang Wood Shop on Nanjing Road. At that time, Le's son, Songxiong, was a comprador in the film department of the Pacific Trading Company. Seeing Zhu's talent and beauty, he could not help but desire her. He pursued Zhu in every possible way. In 1930, he invited Zhu to visit the scenic spots of Hangzhou, and they had an ambiguous relationship. In April of the following year, Zhu gave birth to a daughter, named Zhier by Songxiong. At the same time, Songxiong rented a house with Zhu at No. 598 Laoshenfu Road and lived together. In October of 1932, Zhu gave birth to another daughter, named Ren'er. After Zhu lived with Le, their relationship was extremely harmonious. She even celebrated that she would be settled for life. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last long. Since last fall, Le suddenly changed his attitude towards Zhu, treating her like an old fan. Zhu had no choice but to hire Lawyer Xue Jiaqi to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting that the defendant Le Songxiong be ordered to pay living expenses of $12,000 and return the advance payment of $1,500. Judge Ma Yishu of the court summoned the defendant Le Songxiong several times. Le Songxiong also hired Lawyer Yan Yinwu to represent him in court and filed a counterclaim, requesting that he be granted a divorce from Zhu, that the two daughters be handed over, and that Le be responsible for raising them. The case has already been judged, ordering the defendant Le Songxiong to pay the plaintiff Zhu Liqing alimony of $6,000 and return the advance payment. During the appeal period, he must pay monthly living expenses of $60. The defendant's lawsuit was rejected. However, the defendant has not paid to date. Yesterday morning was the date for civil execution. Judge Shu summoned both parties for execution. The living expenses for the two months during the appeal period, totaling $120, have not been paid. Only Zhu arrived in court. Judge Shu instructed that the defendant's summons had not been delivered and that another summons would be scheduled.</p>

<h3>Welfare Agency Fills Out Interview Records for Vagrants</h3>
<p>Zhang Zixin, the director of the Welfare Agency, sent a letter instructing the administrators to investigate the conditions of the poor and fill out interview records so that they could be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau.

<p>Last year, he formed an inextricable bond with Gu Yizhen, a woman from the countryside of Wuxi. Gu was only eighteen years old and unmarried. Her sister, Saizhen, lived in the Jiumu Di area of the city. After Gu had an affair with Yizhen, he initially promised to marry her. Therefore, Yizhen's mother, Bao, and Saizhen both agreed. Bao often addressed Gu as "son-in-law" in her letters and referred to herself as the mother-in-law. Letters were exchanged frequently, mostly through Saizhen, to avoid any mishaps. Unexpectedly, Gu Wenzhong recently became unfaithful and treated Yizhen as a stranger. Gu's mother, Bao, then, in her capacity as the legal guardian of her daughter, hired a lawyer to sue Gu Wenzhong for disrupting the family in the First Special District Court and requested that he be interrogated and punished according to law. Judge Wu Tingqi opened a hearing several times. It was learned that Gu Bao had already recognized Gu Wenzhong as her son-in-law. He instructed both parties to go out and reconcile, and that there was no need to abandon amity and exult enmity. However, although both parties respected the judge's intention to settle the matter, they were still unwilling to engage in frank negotiations and reach a settlement. Half a month has passed, and it has not been resolved. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was scheduled to resume. The defendant Gu Wenzhong did not appear, but the plaintiff was represented by Gu Yizhen and her lawyer, who requested another postponement to continue negotiations. Judge Wu then granted the request and postponed the hearing to 2:30 PM on the 25th of next month. If a settlement is reached before the next hearing, then they may submit a statement requesting the withdrawal of the complaint.</p>
<h3>The Zhabei Soup Kitchen Invites the Press for a Visit</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Liuying Road Soup Kitchen invited members of the Shanghai press to visit the kitchen yesterday morning. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers gathered at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. After a light breakfast, they departed at 8:30 AM. They arrived at the Liuying Road kitchen at 9:00 AM. Then, led by Wang Binyan and others, they toured the facility. The tour concluded around 10:00 AM, and the kitchen provided transportation to take them back. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 People Crying Out for Food. When the reporters arrived at Liuying Road, the soup distribution had just ended. A mass of impoverished people, men, women, and children, in tattered clothes, carrying ladles and bowls, were crowding out of the soup kitchen. In this beautiful city, who could have imagined that there were so many refugees crying out for food? Roughly estimated, there were no fewer than 20,000 people, all with sorrowful faces, a truly heartbreaking sight. The reporters then got out of the car and were greeted by Mr. Wang Binyan and others, who invited them inside for a tour.</p>
<p>Those Who Did Not Get Soup Received Copper Coins. Inside, there were three crude bamboo sheds, built with dense bamboo grids for people to sit and rest. One was for men, one for women, and one for children. This was to prevent crowding during distribution and to protect women and children from being crushed. Therefore, each shed had its own separate entrance and exit. Security guards were stationed at the site to maintain order, which was relatively good. There were also five straw huts, each with two stoves, and each stove had three pots, with large vats placed beside them, totaling seventeen. Based on the soup distribution yesterday morning, a total of forty dan of rice were cooked. Those who were unable to receive soup were given copper coins instead, totaling fifty-three yuan. The cooking of the soup began at 11:00 PM and was stored in the vats. Each vat could feed 300 people. The doors opened at 4:00 AM, and people went to the soup distribution room to receive soup. Adults received three ladles each, and children received two ladles each. After receiving the soup, they went to the bamboo sheds. The doors closed around 8:00 AM and the distribution was completed around 9:00 AM. When the doors were closed, the bamboo sheds were opened, and people left in batches.</p>
<p>Wang Binyan Discussed the Plight of the Poor. Mr. Wang told the Central News Agency reporter that as many as 20,000 to 30,000 impoverished people from Zhabei and Jiangwan came here daily seeking food due to hunger and cold. More than 7,000 were men, two-thirds of whom were young and strong. These were mostly unemployed workers or laborers, as more and more factories in Zhabei were closing down, and the business situation was becoming increasingly dire. Even rickshaw pullers could not earn enough to eat. Furthermore, it is important to note that in previous years, most of those who came for soup were from Jiangbei or Anhui, with very few locals. Now, even from as far as Jiangwan, there are many locals who endure the wind and dew at 2:00 AM and trek long distances in the hope of getting a bowl of soup. Because of the large number of people, the soup kitchen has to distribute soup to everyone it sees. However, what one person receives cannot support the whole family. Therefore, the elderly, the young, the sick, and the weak have to be brought along. People in Shanghai and various charitable organizations know about the disasters in various provinces and call for relief efforts, but they do not realize that the plight of the lower classes in Shanghai is no less severe than that of the disaster victims in various provinces. This is a regret. I hope that the gentlemen of the press will publicize this in the newspapers so that all sectors can understand the truth and provide practical assistance.</p>
<h3>Both Railways Collect Old Uniforms to Help Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Previously, the Railway Bureau, considering the severe drought in various provinces last year and the widespread devastation among the disaster victims, decided to collect all the old uniforms stored in various offices in accordance with the spirit of mutual assistance, so as to help with relief efforts. Recently, the following items have been collected: 696 winter uniforms, 452 pairs of winter trousers, 98 coats, 12 summer uniforms, and 34 pairs of summer trousers. On January 15, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Relief of Drought Disasters in Various Provinces, requesting that it distribute the items on its behalf. Subsequent receipts will be sent in batches for redistribution.</p>
<h3>Insulting Ms. Li Bingyan, the Captain Was Ordered by the Ministry of Communications to Terminate the Employment Contract</h3>
<p>Ms. Li Bingyan, a graduate of the Chinese Medical College, traveled from Guangzhou to Shanghai on the China Merchants Bureau's Wuyang Ship. During the voyage, the ship's captain, Na Guishi, attempted to insult her. The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has already notified the Jiping Shipping Company to suspend Captain Na Guishi of the Wuyang Ship and has submitted a report on the handling of the matter to the Ministry of Communications. The Bureau received instructions from the Ministry yesterday, stating, in essence, that it had received the report and should order the Jiping Shipping Company to terminate Na Guishi's employment contract. The Shipping Administration Bureau, after receiving the order, has already instructed the Jiping Shipping Company to comply.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Fruit Stalls on Various Roads Re-Petition the Public Works Department Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Answer: No Action Will Be Taken if Traffic Is Not Obstructed</p>
<p>Because the Public Works Department took action against businesses and a Western constable No. 195 assaulted vendors, fruit stall vendors on various roads in the Public Works Department petitioned the councilmen the day before yesterday. They received a reply that, out of consideration, they were allowed to operate. However, the constables on the Sixth Road of Dongxin Bridge still took action against them. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they sent representatives Cai Shuqing, Hong Achu, and Huang Asi to the Public Works Department to petition again. Councilman He De Kui received them and replied that if traffic was not obstructed, they could operate with peace of mind and the Public Works Department would definitely not take action against them. The representatives were satisfied and then left.</p>
<h3>The Bar Association Sends a Letter to the Court Requesting the Maintenance of Order</h3>
<p>Issued Because of Ke Yinghao Assaulting Lawyer Zhu Si-fu</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Ke Yinghao, a Fujianese, relying on his Japanese nationality, arbitrarily yelling in the First Special District Court, the Shanghai Bar Association sent a letter to President Guo yesterday, requesting a correction. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sir, According to reports in the newspapers on the 12th of this month, Ke Yinghao, relying on his Japanese nationality, arbitrarily yelled in your court, disrespecting his superiors, and assaulting the opposing lawyer, Zhu Sifu, in court. This is outrageous. The dignity of the judiciary and the order of the court should be obeyed not only by the people of this country but also by foreigners of all countries. This Ke Yinghao, regardless of whether he is of Japanese nationality, arbitrarily destroys the order of the Chinese court. This is unacceptable to our judicial community. We hereby send this letter, hoping that your court will maintain the dignity of the court and legally stop Ke Yinghao when he is summoned again. If he engages in any illegal actions again, correct them immediately. "</p>

<h3>Case of Goods Falling and Crushing a Person to Death</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Grants Bereaved Family 500 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>Comprador Fan Generously Donates Money to Transport Coffin Back to Tianjin</p>
<p>On December 28 of last year, Huang Xiufeng, a Tianjin native, traveled from Tianjin to Shanghai on the Sanbei Company's Jing'an ship to look for his son. When the ship passed through the Black Water Ocean, the corn cargo in the cabin suddenly collapsed, crushing Huang to death. Huang's wife, Huang Anshi, upon hearing the news, came specially from Tianjin, grieving loudly over the coffin. Since Huang's tragic death had left nine family members without a livelihood and the eldest son was still studying, the second son was young, and the four daughters were all unmarried, in order to maintain their future livelihoods, she, along with her eldest son, Guisheng, went to the Sanbei Company on Guangdong Road to see General Manager Yu Qiaqing, personally explaining their plight and requesting compensation. Huang Guisheng also reported to the Eighth District Branch of the Second Special District City Federation of Trade Unions for assistance. The meeting decided to report it to the Second Special District City General Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting then decided to send a letter to Yu Qiaqing requesting generous compensation. Director Wu Guowei delivered the letter in person. Director Wu met with Yu Qiaqing in person and gently explained on behalf of the deceased's family. Yu Qiaqing was deeply sympathetic and agreed to grant a special condolence payment of 500 yuan. At the same time, Mr. Fan Menglin, the comprador of the Jing'an ship, also acted bravely out of a sense of justice and generously donated money to the deceased's family to transport Huang Xiufeng's coffin back to Tianjin, so as to avoid additional burden on the deceased's family. Huang Anshi and her son were deeply grateful. Therefore, they scheduled to submit a statement to the Procuratorate of the District Court in the morning, collect the coffin and close the case, and transport the coffin, go to the Sanbei Company to collect the condolence payment, and return to Tianjin on the same day.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan Farm Schedules Prunus Mume Conference</h3>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing, since its opening, has been painstakingly managed and is roughly scaled. In addition to managing agricultural products, it has also devoted itself to horticulture.

<h3>A Minor Worker's Theft of Rice Causes a Disturbance</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. wharf at Lujiazui, Pudong, the "Zhaoxing" steamship arrived. At 11:00 AM, while unloading rice, a porter named Ma Keli from Shandong secretly stole loose rice, concealing it around his waist, intending to leave the wharf.  Li Buyue, a police officer stationed at the wharf, stepped forward to search him. Unexpectedly, Ma immediately dumped the stolen rice into the river, claiming the stolen goods were not found on him, and acting righteous and confident. Consequently, he argued with Officer Li. The officer then blew his whistle, summoning help from neighboring posts, who assisted in detaining Ma and taking him to the station for questioning.  After a while, another porter, Zhang Xueyin, gathered dozens of fellow workers who swarmed the station entrance, demanding Ma's release. The workers were all armed with carrying poles, iron hooks, and other implements. As their demands were not met, they took the opportunity to smash the station's doors and window glass, and struck Officer Li Buyue, who was detaining Ma, causing skin injuries to his left hand and left side of his face. Another officer, Kong Xiangxi, also sustained a bleeding injury to the back of his left hand. They also tore the pocket of his uniform. Zhang Baiyi, the comprador of the wharf, learned of the incident and immediately notified the Pudong Public Security Bureau by telephone. Director Zhang of the bureau ordered Chief Guo Yongliang to lead officers to suppress the disturbance, which fortunately did not escalate. The instigating workers, Ma Chongli, Zhang Xueyin, and foreman Wei Rixin, were taken to the bureau for interrogation. The two injured officers were sent to Pudong Hospital for treatment. At this point, the Shandong workers collectively ceased work in a show of support. The bureau then dispatched officers a second time to suppress the unrest, and the workers resumed their work.  Afterward, the bureau chief transferred the three apprehended individuals to the main bureau for further action. In the afternoon, the comprador of the wharf sent a letter to the bureau, detailing that the workers had been previously disputing over unsuccessful attempts to increase wages for the upstairs and downstairs loading work for the second and third floors of the warehouse, and that they used this incident as a pretext to cause trouble, requesting continued police protection to prevent a strike, etc.</p>
<h3>Worker Injured in House Demolition</h3>
<p>Two buildings at No. 46 and No. 48 Xinxing Road, west of the Han Bridge in Zhabei, had previously suffered a major fire. Although there was no significant loss, the wooden beams, bricks, and tiles were no longer usable. Therefore, the landlord hired a construction company to demolish them for reconstruction. Yesterday at around 3:00 PM, six or seven workers were climbing on the roof, removing the roof tiles when the roof beams, having become charred and brittle after the fire, could not withstand the load and broke, causing all the workers to fall. Fortunately, the height was not great, and they only suffered minor injuries. An ambulance was summoned and they were taken to the Second Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Den Cracked in Kaifeng Road</h3>
<p>Detective Ji Xiuzhuan and Western Detective Gibbson of the Sze-kaai Police Station, acting on a search warrant, searched No. 247 Xie Xing Lane, Kaifeng Road, at 10:15 PM the night before, targeting an establishment selling red pills. They arrested four people: a local woman, Xu He Shi, Xu Dai Shi, Zhang Yuncai from Ningbo, and Qian Axi. They confiscated 168 small packets of red pills, as well as two large bags, and over five taels of loose red pills. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, in addition to stating the case, also declared that it was found that Xu Jinmai (also known as Xiao Jinbao, Xu He Shi's husband) and Da Arong were in charge of the red pill den and are still at large. The lawyer requested a postponement. Judge Liu inquired and ordered Xu He Shi and the other three to be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Three Thatched Houses Burned Down</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, a fire broke out in the thatched house built by Qian Musheng in Zhangjia Lane at the Hongqiao Road airfield in Shanghai's western suburbs, due to carelessness. The flames quickly burst through the roof. Fueled by the wind, the raging fire was unstoppable for a time. It was eventually extinguished after the villagers made a concerted effort to put it out. Three thatched houses were burned down.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, an unidentified male corpse, estimated to be over 50 years old, was discovered lying dead on the left side of the road in front of the Xuhui Middle School on Tianzhutang Road, Xujiahui Town in Shanghai's western suburbs. He was wearing a black cloth padded jacket and trousers, black thread socks, black cotton shoes, and had a small black hat beside him. The patrol officer on duty, Shen Guanglian, reported to the station chief, Hong Zhen, who ordered the bailiff Cao Zhongqing to report it to the hospital for examination. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Hospital sent prosecutor Kong Xianglin, accompanied by the coroner, to the scene for examination. The examination determined that the deceased had died of illness. As no family members were found, an order was issued to take photos, and the corpse was handed over to the bailiff for coffin preparation and burial.</p>
<h3>Gambling Case at Hong Yun Restaurant Adjudicated</h3>
<p>The Hong Yun Restaurant in the French Concession, on the Caishi Road, had recently rented its main hall to the gambling boss Shao Youfeng, ostensibly for a birthday celebration, to gather people for gambling and profiting from commissions. This was discovered by detectives Hang Bingquan, Bao Zongyu, and Cai Zongyi of the French Concession Police's gambling squad. They immediately rushed there and arrested the boss Shao Youfeng, Zhou Jinsheng, and 88 gamblers, including Zhou Guangyuan, Hu Siming, Gao Guanghou, Cheng Yifei, Shao Si, Hu Guisong, Zhou Afu, etc. They confiscated four sets of mahjong tiles, one set of pai gow tiles, two decks of playing cards, and over one hundred yuan in gambling money. On the grounds that the restaurant provided a gambling venue in violation of regulations, the manager Zhou Yanzhe and others were arrested and taken to the Second Special Court for prosecution. Judge Sun Pengxian of the Eighth Criminal Court presided over the trial. He ordered Shao Youfeng and Zhou Yanzhe to be detained, and the others were released on bail pending sentencing. As noted in previous reports, yesterday, Judge Sun sentenced boss Shao Youfeng for gathering people for gambling to a fine of 200 yuan, Zhao Yanzhe for violating regulations to a fine of 150 yuan, the waiter Zhou Jinsheng to a fine of 10 yuan, and the other gamblers to fines of 5 yuan, 3 yuan, and some were declared not guilty.

<h3>Recent News from the Esperanto Association</h3>
<p>Debate on International Language Issues with Westerners Wins</p>
<p>The Shanghai Esperanto Association, in order to facilitate the study of Esperanto by local scholars, is running Esperanto training classes. The tenth session has already begun this Tuesday (details have been noted in this newspaper). Recently, at the invitation of the Western YMCA, the association attended a debate on the 17th at 9:00 PM, the topic was "English can be used as an international language." First, a member of the YMCA, Hua Erfu, came out to defend it, and then Zhao Juecheng represented the Esperanto side in rebuttal. The two sides argued for half an hour. Afterwards, the attendees expressed their opinions. As a result, the Esperanto side won by fourteen to twelve votes. It is heard that the association, with the increasing attention paid to Esperanto by people from all walks of life, plans to set up an Esperanto consultation department to accept and answer all questions from the outside world about Esperanto. Inquirers can go to the association at Yongpingfang, Kad Road, to discuss it in person.</p>
<h3>Two New Rubbings Recently Published by the Medical Bookstore</h3>
<p>Rubbing of Lv Yaoxian's Xiao Jian Four-Zhu coin, one volume. This is a rubbing of the Xiao Jian Four-Zhu coin, presented by Vice Minister Lv Yaoxian to Mr. Chen Shouqing. There are as many as fifty-four kinds. Bao Zinian's "Spring Said" says, "The Xiao Jian Four-Zhu has the character 'Ye' on one side and the character 'Xiao' on one side, which is the most difficult to obtain. The so-called one coin in the capital costs two to three thousand coins. At the end of the Daoguang period, an urn was suddenly unearthed in Southern China. Yaoxian collected hundreds of them and distributed them to others. Not only are they of different sizes, but some are upside down on one side, some are read from left to right, and there are also differences between one character being upright and one character being upside down. Some are placed horizontally on one side, above and below the perforation, and some are facing left and right. Some are upside down on one side, and some are shaped on one side, or both sides are shaped, and there are four stars, four circles, and four broken patterns. The Xiao Jian has the difference between the same text or upside down horizontal placement on both sides, and the Four-Zhu also has the same text on both sides, and the Four-Zhu characters are also made above and below the perforation. There are as many as fifty-four kinds of peculiarities. Although it is as small as an elm pod, it is green and refreshing, and it is absolutely worthy of treasure. Coinage coins are becoming more and more strange, and they are fully prepared in our dynasty. I believe that the earth does not love treasure." Now, comparing Bao's theory with this rubbing, there is no disagreement. It is truly a grand view of the Xiao Jian Four-Zhu coin. Now, it is printed with a glass plate, which is exactly the same as the true rubbing. The actual price is one yuan per volume.</p>
<p>Rubbing of Chen Shouqing's Six Coin Ten Bu coin, one volume. This is a rubbing presented by Mr. Chen Shouqing to Vice Minister Wu Qingqing. First, Wang Mang's Yang Quan Ten Bu is listed. Ten Bu has two pairs, one with a small straight line above the perforation, and the other without it. At the end, rubbings of ancient coins such as Libu are attached. Now, Chen's original version is printed, which is exactly the same as the true rubbing. Seeing it is like seeing the true coin. The actual price is one yuan per volume.

<h3>Organization of the Fruit Trade Union Association</h3>
<p>All fruit store employees, in view of the fact that in recent years they have been subjected to pressure from the capital side, using the sweat and blood of their lives like cows and horses to exchange for meager wages, repeatedly suffering deductions by the store owners, and in order to increase the knowledge and skills of the employees, improve their lives, etc., it is particularly necessary to organize a group. Therefore, dozens of employees initiated it and jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department, requesting the organization of the Shanghai Fruit Industry Occupational Union, which was approved. Nine people, including Rong Baokang, Hong Dexing, Shen Baokun, Xu Binggui, Bao Liren, Chu Songhai, Weng Wuquan, Jiang Wenquan, and Zheng Wensong, were appointed as preparatory members. When registration began, Cai Runshen, chairman of the Fruit Land Trade Association, repeatedly ordered the employees to sign letters of intent and guarantees, etc., based on the provisions of Articles 31 and 32 of the Trade Union Law, in order to destroy the organization, almost causing a major dispute. After mediation, in order to settle the matter, the labor side followed the mediator's intention and changed the name of the Shanghai Fruit Industry Occupational Union to the Shanghai Fruit Industry Employee Association, which was still approved by the Municipal Party Department. After discussion at a meeting of the employees, it was decided that Rong Baokang and the other nine people would continue to be responsible for the preparations. It is heard that the association is preparing to hold a general meeting to elect directors and supervisors in due course, so that its success can be observed.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Peng Xiangying's Lecture on the Relationship Between Citizens and Air Defense (Continued)</h3>
<p>However, at this time when we should work hard, we must fully prepare the sand and fire extinguishers used to extinguish fires caused by incendiary bombs, and the buckets of water and other items used for fire prevention. Within the realm of possibility, we must also purchase gas masks, so that when enemy planes drop both incendiary bombs and gas bombs during wartime, we can engage in firefighting work.</p>
<p>However, in wartime, if an incendiary bomb falls, it must be immediately covered with sand and extinguished to prevent it from spreading. If it has spread and spread to other objects, fire extinguishers or buckets of water should be used to extinguish it. Even residents in neighboring lanes must immediately gather and cooperate to carry out rescue. In addition, government offices, schools, factories, and major companies should always have fire-fighting equipment, and organize staff, workers, and students into fire brigades for pre-training. Then, with wartime preparations, if peacetime disasters occur, fire-fighting benefits can be obtained more effectively.</p>
<p>The above is specifically about the fire-fighting item. The responsibilities borne by citizens are so important. During air raids, all tasks such as anti-virus, rescue, engineering, security, traffic management, and alarm transmission also need to be mainly undertaken by citizens, because these are the affairs that are most closely related to citizens. If citizens do not automatically take on these tasks, even if the government leads them, it is not easy to achieve thorough and widespread results. Therefore, the relationship between citizens and air defense is indeed very close, and the task of air defense is indeed entirely up to the citizens.</p>
<p>Recently, our government authorities have felt that the national crisis is frequent, and the crisis is imminent. The ambitions of strong neighbors are on the rise. If something happens one day, our important cities will inevitably be attacked by air in an instant and reduced to ashes. Therefore, in November of last year, the first large-scale air defense exercise was held in the capital. This can be said to be a creation in the national air defense facilities, because this air defense exercise not only gave the citizens of Nanjing a very deep understanding of air defense, but also made the people of the whole country aware of the need for air defense. If we have a considerable understanding of air defense and know that it is an urgent and serious problem, we should actively study it and work hard to implement it. Although our country lacks financial resources and is behind in everything, the necessary national defense construction cannot be achieved in a moment. But as long as all our comrades can be determined to work hard, it will not be difficult to catch up and keep pace with the great powers. (End)</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: In a Remote Place, a Light Official Greets a Strong-Willed Mandarin; Outside the Splendid Banquet Hall, There is a Pitiable Wretch</p>
<p>On Cheng Zhiqian's side, he knew very well that Zhang and Li were both incorrigibly vulgar, corrupt officials. However, since they were being so polite and proactively greeting him, he couldn't bring himself to ignore them. Therefore, when Zhang Jiefu approached him with a fawning attitude, he could only force a smile and invite him to sit down. However, Zhang Jiefu had his own agenda. He reached into his coat pocket and rummaged around for a while. He pulled out a small blue cloth bundle, which he unwrapped to reveal a white silk handkerchief package. Opening the handkerchief package, there was a piece of red paper holding two jade objects. One was a finger ring with a semi-circular crack, and the other was a finely carved small jade horse. Cheng Zhiqian was a bit taken aback, wondering if Zhang was also in the jade business and was trying to solicit a sale. Zhang Jiefu, however, smiled ingratiatingly, holding the red paper with both hands. He presented it to Cheng Zhiqian, saying, "This small token is nothing to speak of." Cheng Zhiqian was even more stunned. They had no previous relationship, so why was he offering such valuable gifts? How could he possibly accept them? He repeatedly waved his hands, saying, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. I couldn't possibly accept such a generous gift." Zhang Jiefu placed the jade on the table, cupped his hands in a gesture of respect, and said, "I knew Mr. Cheng wouldn't be willing to accept it. But if I explain, Mr. Cheng might reconsider. I have a fellow villager in Xi'an who deals in antiques. I went to see him today, and he casually gave me these two items. He gave them to me not without a purpose. He thinks I know many people in politics and that people might come to Xi'an to buy antiques, so he wants me to introduce them. I think it would be a waste if he just gave these things to me, especially since they're worth about thirty or forty dollars. I really have no use for them. Mr. Cheng is a man of wide connections. As the saying goes, 'A precious sword is given to a hero,' so I'm giving them to Mr. Cheng." (116)</p>
<h3>The Physiognomy of Great Men</h3>
<p>— (A Rustic Old Man)</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Jiangniao's "Four Strange Physiognomies," which said that famous people in Shanghai all have strange appearances, I was reminded of the physiognomies of the great men of the Party and the Nation. Here's a brief description of a few: (1) The Scholar's Appearance: Mr. Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, is known to all as a pioneer of the revolution and a great statesman of our time. Now in his fifties, he looks like a courteous scholar, no more than forty years old. Like Mr. Hu Hanmin, he is a refined, gentlemanly, fair-skinned scholar. Who would think that he is a great revolutionary? History says that Zhang Zifang had the appearance of a woman, which shows that this is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>(2) The Bodhisattva's Appearance: Mr. Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, used to write essays in the Tianduo Bao and Minquan Bao that were forceful and sharp. I imagined him to be a very different person. Since converting to Buddhism, he has become solemn and compassionate, which overflows from his face. He truly resembles Mr. Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Di Pingzi, and others in Shanghai, displaying the "Wonderful Appearance of the Tathagata."</p>
<p>(3) The Immortal's Appearance: Mr. Chu Minyi, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, is tall and imposing and is skilled in Taijiquan. He resembles one of the Eight Immortals. Perhaps this is because his learning and cultivation have transformed his temperament and appearance.</p>
<p>(4) The Old Woman's Appearance: Mr. Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee who calls himself Granny Liu from the Grand View Garden, is getting on in years. His mouth is pursed, and he does have something of an "old woman's appearance." But although Mr. Wu's mouth is pursed, his tongue is like a lotus flower. When he speaks, he is incredibly humorous and profound. He truly deserves to be called Granny Liu.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Banana Heart)</p>
<p>Xi Shi is a classic example of a beauty in Chinese history. Her hometown is the village of Luoluo in Zhuji, Zhejiang. It is said that a supremely beautiful woman is still born in that village every year, but she is always unlucky and dies young.</p>
<p>Zheng Banqiao said: "We scholars, as soon as we pick up a book, we want to become officials, how to seize money, build big houses, and acquire a lot of land; from the very beginning, we go down the wrong path, and later we get worse and worse, and there is never a good result. "But, how many scholars in the world do not follow this same path?</p>
<h3>The Decline of Handicraft Industries</h3>
<p>— (Chen Liang)</p>
<p>From the mouths of several fellow villagers who work as craftsmen, I have learned about the recent decline of handicraft industries. Although they are fortunate enough not to have lost their jobs, they are barely making a living, and their lives are extremely difficult. Their short shirts and pants are the color of soy sauce. They don't even have money to get a haircut or take a bath. Now, I will roughly write down what a few of them said below, which is also a serious social problem.</p>
<p>A tailor said, "People all think that clothing is always necessary. Although that's true, it's hard to make money in these times. Ordinary families are tightening their belts on every expense. For example, they turn over old styles, make big clothes smaller, and change the surface of leather clothes. They save on new clothes if they can. As a result, we tailors have no prospects. The worktable is deserted, and the tailors are frowning as they play Wuguan. Do you think things can get better?"</p>
<p>A book cover maker said, "Reading friends all know that nowadays, all books are being changed to hardcover editions. Some time ago, there were still some thread-bound books that used book covers, but now they have also been affected by the competition and dumping of bookstores, which have reprinted many old books and novels as single volumes with foreign paper covers. They consider book covers to be outdated and superfluous. People who make book covers have also been deprived of their livelihoods."</p>
<p>A red sandalwood worker said, "We rely on our strength to make a living. As long as we can pull a saw for a day, we don't have to worry about going hungry. However, everyone these days is pursuing foreign styles and using Western-style furniture. Wealthier people don't even use traditional foreign goods, not to mention everything from flushing toilets to chrome beds. Moreover, small pieces are no longer in the foreign style. Now that we have the strength but no work, is this the end of the line for us?"</p>
<p>There are also grinders, coppersmiths... I can't write about many. In short, some people in the city who have purchasing power admire European culture. Their daily necessities are all imported goods, even the toilet paper they use is not domestic. As for the inland areas, all the clothes and utensils they have must be pawned for money. What purchasing power can they have? The result of the above is that China's national industry is declining, and the handicraft industry is collapsing behind the machine-made industry.</p>
<h3>Records of Incense Lingering in the Air</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This is another very difficult-to-obtain piece of specialized knowledge. After hearing it, we all found it very interesting. Countless gazes were focused on that horse, which had been covered in dust for a long time and had only been hastily cleaned up today, while the Empress Dowager was particularly proud.</p>
<p>Comparing the hard and brave life of people in the past with the life in the imperial palace now, I really don't know how much of a difference there is! It almost makes us unable to believe that the Manchu rulers of the past could have endured such hardships! But some of them are true! Not only the leaders were like this, but all the imperial relatives, ministers, and close attendants in the palace can be said to have been tempered and encouraged in this kind of life every day. At this moment, hundreds of years of luxurious life in China has completely softened us.</p>
<p>By this time, we had visited all three of these not-so-small palaces. We were then led by the Empress Dowager to the open square outside. In the past, almost every day people would rely on their courage and strength to fight for their lives with those wild beasts with sharp claws. Now, it has become a useless wasteland, but the forest on the west side of the square is even more lush and verdant. The tall shadows of the trees flickered on the ground, almost making us suspect that some wild beasts would rush out from inside. The Empress Dowager raised her head and looked around casually, as if sighing with great emotion.</p>
<p>Before we decided to come here, the Empress Dowager had given a brief account of the commemorative history of this day in the Shenyang palace, and had also promised to tell us the details after we saw the forest here. Now, we have arrived in front of the forest, so her promise has been fulfilled! (226)</p>
<h3>The Mad Dance of Skeletons</h3>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Food has various different tastes, and distinguishing these tastes depends entirely on the mouth.</p>
<p>The mouth can taste what is sweet, what is salty, what is sour, what is bitter, and what is spicy.</p>
<p>People's tastes also vary. Generally speaking, most people like to eat sweet things, followed by those who like to eat salty things, then those who like to eat spicy things, and as for those who like to eat bitter things, they are said to be extremely rare.</p>
<p>My second brother loves to eat sour things. Every time he eats noodles, he always complains that the soup is too salty. Once, the family deliberately put only vinegar in his noodle soup. After he finished eating, he asked him how the soup tasted. He said, "The soup tastes very good today, but it's a little less salty." In fact, he didn't know that there was no salt in the soup at all! This is also a joke about taste.</p>
<p>If a cook wants to win the favor of the master, it seems that he must first know the master's taste, but this cannot be regarded as a good cook. A truly good cook is one who can cook delicious dishes that make people adapt to his taste.</p>
<p>Therefore, we ask all cooks to cook standard, compelling delicacies, and at the same time, we hope that all eaters have standard taste-distinguishing tongues.</p>
<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3>Night Visit to Tianning Temple</h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>The prosperity of Chinese Buddhism has a long history. There are many ancient temples in various places, which have long been famous in the world. Taking Tianning Temple as an example, there are four places. One is outside of Beijing, between Beijing and Zhangjiakou. One is outside of the Tianning Gate in Jiangdu. One is outside of the West Gate of Haikang County in Guangdong. The one I am talking about is that one that was built in the Tang Dynasty outside of the East Gate of Changzhou.</p>
<p>I was traveling to Changzhou, on a cloudy day in early winter without snow. I walked into the train station and saw the city center in the distance, already adorned with bright lights. The night wind was blowing very hard. I hailed a rickshaw and entered the city alone, planning to have a great drink of Lanlu famous wine and devour a lot of thin-skinned, fresh pork, because I was visiting for the first time. I asked the rickshaw puller to take me there. I can say that I was completely ignorant of the names of the streets I passed. However, judging from the city's appearance, where business was not very flourishing in the evening, it was still similar to Gui Cheng in Yixing.</p>
<p>The rickshaw was stopped at Xiaofu Bridge. Fortunately, the lights were burning brightly in the night market. I turned west towards the bridge and caught sight of the Deshun Restaurant on Xianzhi Street. I was very hungry, so I went upstairs to repair my five internal organs. Needless to say, the taste of the wine was not as good as that of Dongpu Xingruanshe in Shaoxing. Li Taibai's "Lanling Wine, Tulip Fragrance" was just an occasional mad rant. On the other hand, Dongpo fatty pork was not inferior to that of Huangzhou in Hubei. I especially loved to eat the sugar-soaked celery, which was beautiful in color, aroma, and taste!</p>
<p>After getting drunk and full, I went downstairs. I thought that my friend who was living in Tianning Temple was sick. Rather than spending money in a noisy inn to spend this lonely cold night, it would be better to go to the ancient temple to talk to him. Moreover, I could also take the opportunity to inquire about his recent health. So I called the temple and asked them not to close the mountain gate too early.</p>
<p>I got back on the rickshaw and looked at the quiet streets and alleys and the changing stars in the moonlight, which was as cool as water. I had some sad feelings of loneliness on the journey. Thanks to the rickshaw puller's arm strength, he pulled me to Dongzhi Street. I listened to the sound of the watchman's gong on the city wall, slowly becoming lighter and farther away.</p>
<p>Turning and lingering, I didn't know how many roads I had traveled. Because of fatigue, I closed my eyes and drew out my thoughts. Although the cold wind easily wakes up a light drunk, I immersed myself in a deeper dream. I even vaguely forgot to look at the buildings in the night.</p>
<p>When the rickshaw came out of the East Gate, in the dim yellow light of the oil lamp, I vaguely recognized three or five starving beggars. They were sitting on the straw, dozing off. So I completed a five-character poem: "Poor drunkards seek refuge, lonely traces occasionally visit Zen. Frosty clothes draped over the midday moon, catkins pressing against the Ding year! Travelers hear hungry birds, mansions boil with pipes and strings. It is our generation's business to lament the times, and there is no way to ask the deaf heaven." I planned to stop for a while and recite it to my sick friend to see how he would criticize it.</p>
<p>Almost at the end of Dongzhi Street, the rickshaw puller suddenly asked, his voice filled with hurried breathing:</p>
<p>"Sir, are you going straight to Tianning Temple?"</p>
<p>This cut off my reverie of savoring the verses.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and saw a gray crenellated wall on the left, with a curved round doorway in the center. Moonlight was flowing into the square inside the doorway, with tall green trees, sparsely planted, sleeping in clusters. As soon as I pointed to the mountain gate for the rickshaw puller, the rickshaw rolled in sharply.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was because of the sound of the bell on the rickshaw or the accidental night cry of a roosting bird, but it alerted a sleeping yellow dog, which jumped up and barked wildly. In the quiet night, it was really easy to disturb the monks guarding the gate.</p>
<p>At this time, a frozen cloud flew across the sky, temporarily covering the moon. In the empty courtyard, there was only deep darkness, and the leaves were singing in the wind. Coupled with the barking of the dog, the scene was really moving. I saw the mountain gate in front of me. A little red light was vaguely visible, moving as if it were a lighthouse in the dark night. As the light moved closer and closer, I gradually saw the face of the person carrying the lantern. Wasn't that a monk wearing a tall hat? I immediately jumped off the rickshaw, paid the fare, and hurried towards the red light by the tree. I said gratefully:</p>
<p>"Master, you've worked hard! I've made you wait a long time."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter! Sir, are you coming from the city?" The monk stood still and asked me in return. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ten Questions and Ten Answers</h3>
<p>(1) Doctor Zhao asks: I have been practicing medicine for many years, but I regret that I do not have a perfect medical and nursing textbook to refer to. You have lived in Shanghai for a long time and must have seen and heard a lot. Can you tell me one or two things? Answer: The Guangxie Bookstore at No. 140 Beijing Road, Shanghai (corner of Bote Yuan Road) sells books of the Chinese Medical Association (formerly the Boyihui) and the Chinese Nurses Association. It should have everything you need. You may wish to write for a catalog and read it. (2) Principal Li asks: There are many students in our school, and we plan to implement a new life movement, focusing on hygiene. Where can we purchase hygiene books? Answer: The Shanghai Guangxue Bookstore sells all kinds of hygiene books, forms, models, and lantern slides from the Chinese Hygiene Education Association, the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Health Department, and major bookstores. The styles are complete and it is very convenient to purchase them.</p>
<p>(3) Ms. Huang Lizhu asks: There are more than a dozen infants and young children in my house, who often suffer from diseases, causing both mental and economic losses. Is there any wonderful strategy to remedy this? I hope you can give me some advice! Answer: Infants get sick mostly because parents do not know how to prevent them, and after they get sick, they do not know how to take good care of them. If you have a Parenting Guide (one dollar), Hao Hou Er's Infant and Pediatric Volume (nine yuan), Hao Ci's Pediatric Q&amp;A (two corners), Infant Nursing Method (four corners), or Healthy Living (five yuan) and other books at home, it will be of great help. The above books are sold by Guangxue Bookstore. (4) Colonel Zhang Mingda asks: Mingda has been serving in the Army Hospital for three years. He now plans to study surgery and anatomy. Are there any perfect Chinese texts? Answer: Guangxie Bookstore provides a large number of such medical books. You can write for a catalog.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Wang Boqin asks: I am burdened with studying at a medical school, and I find it difficult to study and translate medical terms because there are no standard translations. Is there a bookstore in Shanghai that sells standard medical dictionaries? Answer: Dictionaries of standard medical terms approved by the Scientific Terminology Review Committee include the Compilation of Medical Terms, eight yuan; English-Chinese Medical Dictionary, four yuan; Chinese-English Medical Dictionary, two and a half yuan; Chinese Pharmacopoeia, six yuan. All distribution points are at Guangxie Bookstore, No. 140 North Jiujiang Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>(6) Professor Di Zilin asks: I have long known that the Guangxie Bookstore is the general authority for selling Chinese medical, nursing, and health books. However, I like to read original Yi books. I wonder if there is a bookstore in Shanghai that sells them on consignment? Answer: Oxford University Press and Columbia University Press in New York publish a wealth of medical books. Guangxie Bookstore is the Chinese manager of these two companies; in addition, the bookstore also sells medical books from other major British and American bookstores.</p>
<p>(7) Miss Xue Huifen asks: After class, I like to sing poems and play the piano to entertain myself. I now plan to add more sheet music and songbooks to increase my enjoyment. Please introduce a good edition, I would be grateful! Answer: Sheet music used by famous girls' schools such as Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' School and St. Mary's are mostly purchased from Guangxie Bookstore; so Miss can also purchase from that bookstore.</p>
<p>(8) Pastor Chen asks: My parishioners are very eager to read various Christian publications in order to understand the truth and preach the gospel, but there are many publishing institutions, and they have repeatedly ordered a book by mail, asking about it back and forth, which takes a lot of time and still results in nothing. Is there a simple and effective way to order by mail? Answer: There are about a hundred Christian publishing institutions, large and small. Shanghai Guangxie Bookstore has spared no expense to collect more than ten thousand kinds of new and old books published by them, and compiled an index (Chinese and English combined one yuan, Chinese version two corners). With this booklet, the title of the book can be established, and you can order from Guangxie Bookstore, which is extremely convenient. (9) Mr. Ge Shangjie asks: I have some experience in studying English. Reading original English versions is ultimately more pure and natural. However, I feel quite inconvenienced to order from abroad every time I return to the country. Is there a bookstore in Shanghai that manages British publications? Answer: Oxford University Press publications are world-renowned, followed by publications from Columbia University Press and more than ten other companies, which Guangxie Bookstore manages on behalf of them; in addition to literature, it also sells specialized scientific books.</p>
<p>(10) Dr. Zhang Chengdao asks: Is the central organization in our country that sells medical, nursing, and health books called Guangxue Bookstore or Guangxie Bookstore? Answer: It was originally called Guangxue Bookstore, but later because the name was easily confused with the Guangxuehui, it was renamed Guangxie Bookstore, and the address is still No. 140 Beijing Road, Shanghai (corner of the Museum Road). Also, the bureau took over the Concord Bookstore.</p>

<h3>Western China Academy Collects Specimens, Yu Jichuan Talks About New Plants Discovered in Xikang</h3>
<p>_Rheidium wood and Gung Tung discovered in high mountains_</p>
<p>_Liangshan Yi people loot Han people as slaves_</p>
<p>(Special telegram from Peiping) Yu Jichuan, chairman of the Department of Botany of the Western China Academy, arrived in Peiping today, bringing more than twenty boxes of plant specimens collected in Sichuan. He will borrow the Institute of Quiet Life Biology to test and determine their functions and types. This afternoon, the reporter visited Yu. According to Yu, the Western China Academy was initiated by Lu Zuofu and others and organized in Ba County, Sichuan Province in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Its main work is to investigate, study, test, and improve the production of the west. Currently, there are institutes of biology, physics and chemistry, geology, and agriculture and forestry. The institutes of biology and geology focus on investigation. In addition to private fundraising, the China Cultural Education Fund Committee provides some subsidies. The responsibility I (Yu) assume is the Department of Botany, so I can only tell you about the situation of the Department of Botany. The main task of the Department of Botany is to investigate timber, medicinal materials, oil materials, and other main tasks. Because Sichuan has the most of these kinds of goods, it is divided into early areas. The predetermined purpose of completing the three surveys by 21 years is about (1) Solving the types of plants, (2) The economic value of plant types. Although the scheduled period has expired, there are still some that have not been completed, so supplementary work is still being done. Since Xikang and Sichuan Province are adjacent to each other and lack people to go there for academic and health investigations, people have recently been sent there to collect plant specimens. The province will be divided into four regions, and it is expected to be completed within two years. Zhuanglai may have new discoveries to contribute to the academic community. As for the plants collected in Sichuan Province, more than ten new species have been discovered and announced. The most recently discovered new species include Rheidium wood, Gung Tung, and azaleas (Rhododendron). The first two need to be found on high mountains with a height of two or three thousand meters. What is their function is still being studied. In mid-August and September last year, the Department of Botany sent staff to the large and small deep mountains in southwestern Sichuan to collect specimens. The area is located between ten counties including Leibo, Mabian, Ebian, Pingshan, Xichang, and Huili in Sichuan. It is occupied by the Yi people. They are very harmful to the Han people. Usually, only small merchants go there, so Sichuan people are all secret lairs. Before we went, we received help from the highest local government and gentry in nearby counties, and used Sichuan salt and earth cloth to buy through the responsible protection of the three branches of Mo Yi (ie chieftain) such as Moshimoqu Enxia, so we dared to go. We stayed there for two months and collected many specimens and discovered large forests, about one hundred li long and more than twenty li wide, and drew maps of the deep mountains. However, we encountered difficulties repeatedly. In the middle of the road, we sacrificed our lives, so we could not complete the whole work after all. The people there occupied Zhaojue County in Sichuan Province, and often robbed Han people as slaves, and could buy and sell them at will. Therefore, the Han people who are now there account for eight or nine out of ten of the total population, and they are generally assimilated. If the Chinese people still indulge in the past, the Yi people's harm to Sichuan Province may be even worse than the Communist bandits, (Jin).</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Compiles Chinese Education Yearbook</h3>
<p>Promoting the Truth of Our Country's Education to the International Community</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved a letter from the International English Yearbook Society, requesting that a 200,000-word overview of Chinese education be compiled and translated into Western languages for international promotion. The reason is that when international organizations compile education yearbooks for various countries around the world, information on Chinese education is often unclear and lacks a comprehensive and systematic record. Therefore, China will compile a comprehensive and systematic overview of education similar to a national education yearbook and send it to the Society. After receiving the letter, the Ministry of Education has completed the compilation of the characteristics and overview of various levels of education, including higher, secondary, elementary, and social education nationwide. It is currently having members proficient in English translate it separately. The English version will be completed soon and sent to the Society for international promotion.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Grade Retention Period for Students Failing the Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to explain the grade retention period for students who fail the entrance examination, instructed the Jiangsu Education Department, stating that the grade retention period for secondary school graduation entrance examinations should be handled in accordance with Article 64 of the Secondary School Regulations. (Article 64 stipulates that students who fail three or more subjects in the graduation entrance examination, or who fail only two subjects, but those subjects are any two of the four subjects in junior high school (Chinese, English, Mathematics, Labor), or any two of the five subjects in senior high school (Chinese, English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry), should be required to repeat the grade for one year. However, this grade repetition is limited to one time. If they still cannot graduate, a certificate of completion will be issued, and they will be required to withdraw from school.)</p>
<h3>Many Schools in Beijing Begin Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>Various schools in Nanjing have completed their semester exams on Wednesday of this week. Elementary schools with sixth-grade graduates (such as Fuxi Street Elementary School) held farewell ceremonies for teachers and students on the afternoon of the 17th and started winter vacation, with self-study assignments for the students to take home. Starting from the 18th, all municipal schools will be closed for vacation. Private secondary schools will start their vacations later, with varying schedules. The two provincial experimental elementary schools in Nanjing, established by Jiangsu Province, also started their winter vacation on the 18th. However, due to the customary practices of students from other provinces, the two provincial secondary schools in Nanjing are starting their winter vacation later, as past experience has shown that too few students and too many staff members return if the vacation ends too early. It is said that most secondary schools throughout Jiangsu Province, except for a few, are starting their winter vacation later. Therefore, the two provincial secondary schools in Nanjing are also starting their winter vacation later, around next week.</p>
<p>[P Zhejiang Education Department Issues Production Achievement Competition Regulations&gt;</p>
<p>Production education has been promoted and supervised by the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department in various counties of Zhejiang Province for several years. The production achievements of various localities should be compared to promote observation and improvement. It is learned that the Education Department, in order to facilitate the implementation of this competition in various counties and cities, has specially issued a 14-article outline of the Zhejiang Provincial Production Achievement Competition Regulations for various counties and cities. The competition methods are: (A) exhibitions; (B) production technology demonstrations, with each demonstration focusing on one or two types of products as a principle, and giving priority to demonstrating improvements in local products. Items A and B above may be held simultaneously. The aforementioned outline has been ordered to be followed by the governments of various counties and cities.</p>
<h3>National Military Training Committee of This City Prepares Summer Military Training for Colleges and Universities</h3>
<p>All Food and Other Expenses Should Be Borne by the Schools</p>
<p>No Changes to High School Centralized Training</p>
<p>Newly Established High Schools Should Receive Military Training from the Start of the Semester</p>
<p>Colleges and universities in this city should receive summer military training this year, as instructed by the Ministry of Education. The National Military Training Committee of this city is currently making preparations. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Summer Training is Being Prepared, the Ministry of Education Previously</h3>
<p>Issued a circular to colleges and universities in this city stating that, except for high school students who should receive centralized training this year and are exempt from summer military training, all colleges and universities should continue to implement summer training according to the original plan. The National Military Training Committee is currently making preparations. All expenses for summer training, such as food, should be borne by the schools.</p>
<h3>Centralized Training Will Not Change High School Military Training</h3>
<p>Students will definitely participate in centralized training from April 10th to July 10th this year. Rumors of changes are absolutely untrue. The expenses will be borne by the government. All schools should prepare to participate and not adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The students who should receive centralized military training are those who started senior high school in the spring or autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic. Students who start in the spring of this year will receive centralized training next year. The location of the training has been determined by the National Military Training Committee, and the facilities are very complete, but it is still difficult to announce temporarily. According to the reporter's speculation, the Longhua Airport may be more suitable.</p>
<h3>Newly Established High Schools Should Receive Military Training</h3>
<p>Newly established senior high schools and existing junior high schools that have recently expanded to include senior high school should implement military training from the beginning of the spring semester. All military instructors in each school should be approved by the Military Training Committee. If they are hired privately without approval, it will be investigated and verified. Not only will the military training be invalid, but strict measures will be taken.</p>
<h3>Winter Vacation Begins in All Schools in This City</h3>
<p>Semester Begins on February 1st</p>
<p>All levels of schools in this city, in accordance with the regulations of the Education Bureau's school calendar, started their winter vacation yesterday. February 1st is set as the beginning of the second semester of the 23rd year of the Republic, and classes will begin on the 2nd. The 4th is the Lunar New Year, and schools should still hold classes as usual. The Education Bureau will also dispatch staff to various schools on that day for strict inspections.</p>
<h3>Emerging Artist Chen Yuefeng Returns to Town Today</h3>
<p>Receipt of Paintings from Various Places Has Now Ceased</p>
<p>Emerging artist Chen Yuefeng (Jingfo) originally planned to return to Ningbo via Hangzhou on the 14th. However, due to social engagements with friends, he is still staying in Shanghai. Yesterday, he received a letter from his mother in Zhenhai, stating that there was an important matter and urging him to return home. Chen has decided to leave Shanghai at 4:00 PM today, taking the "Xin Jiangtian" ship back to Zhenhai. This trip will last about two weeks. The receipt of paintings from various places was ceased on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Ten Professors Hold First Cultural Construction Symposium Today</h3>
<p>Inviting Reporters from Various Newspapers and Professors from Various Universities to Participate</p>
<p>Hoping That This Meeting Will Generate Concrete Proposals</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Writes to He Bingsong, Agreeing with the Principles of the Declaration</p>
<p>The ten professors who recently published the "Declaration on Cultural Construction Based on Chinese Values" are holding their first cultural construction symposium at the Zhongshe today at 5:00 PM to discuss various issues related to cultural construction. Those invited to participate include chief editors from various newspapers, university presidents, and over thirty well-known scholars. The minutes will be published in the fifth issue of the "Cultural Construction Monthly." After publication, opinions from various scholars will be solicited again, hoping to generate more concrete opinions so that this movement does not become an impractical one. He Bingsong, who signed the declaration, previously sent the declaration to Cai Yuanpei. Cai Yuanpei has now replied, acknowledging that the principles in the declaration are indestructible and hoping that he can further strive to materialize the two principles of not adhering to old ways and not blindly following others. The original letter is specially reproduced below:</p>
<p>Mr. Bocheng,</p>
<p>I have read the "Declaration on Cultural Construction Based on Chinese Values" you sent. In principle and in abstract theory, it can be said to be indestructible. Confucius said, "When walking with three people, there must be one who can be my teacher. I choose the good and follow it, and change the bad." This is the attitude of not adhering to old ways and not blindly following others. The most important work now is to choose the good. What is good? What is universally recognized as good by mankind, without distinction between Chinese and non-Chinese? What do Chinese people consider good, but non-Chinese people may consider not good? What do non-Chinese people consider good, but Chinese people consider not good? These objects should be listed separately for comparative research. What should be taken and what should be discarded? The components that should be taken should be systematically organized to form a plan for cultural construction. Then, the characteristics of China that still remain can be pointed out. If there is no such plan and one argues in a vacuum, it will inevitably be like Zhang Zhidong's slogan of "Chinese learning for fundamental principles, Western learning for practical application" or Liang Shuming's "Eastern and Western Cultures" - whether you agree or disagree, it's all empty talk. I offer my humble opinion for your reference. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Your younger brother, Cai Yuanpei, January 18th, Year 24 of the Republic</p>
<h3>Guo Yangyuan Goes to Hangzhou to Promote Rural Sideline Occupations</h3>
<p>Guo Yangyuan, former manager of the Qingdao Minsheng Factory and vocational educator, studied vocational education in the Philippines in his early years and gained much experience. After returning to China, he handled vocational education with remarkable results. In recent years, he has devoted himself to rural sideline occupations. It is said that Mr. Guo recently went to Hangzhou at the invitation of the Hangzhou Women's Vocational School and local people to plan the promotion of rural women's occupations, which is good news in the midst of rural bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>Bingxun Shorthand School Expands</h3>
<p>The Bingxun Chinese Shorthand School on Shanchang Lane, Carter Road, Shanghai, has been offering face-to-face and correspondence courses for many years and has achieved remarkable results. Its graduates are able to serve society and are generally satisfied. It also has a shorthand society that specializes in serving the party, military, government, business, and academic circles to facilitate student practice. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government recruited three shorthand reporters, who were also selected and sent from the school. The school's spring enrollment has already begun, with a quota of 30 students, both male and female. Graduates will graduate in five months, and those who pass the exam will be recommended for employment by the school. In addition, there are two new courses in Chinese typing and applied writing to enhance education. Those interested can go to the school to register and enroll.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Orders the Continued Employment of Graduates from the Shanghai Kindergarten Teachers College</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Kindergarten Teachers College on Jiaozhou Road is the only institution for training kindergarten teachers. In recent years, many kindergartens have been added in various places, so the career prospects of the school's graduates are very easy. There are over one hundred graduates in this class, and there have been many cases of invitations from various places. The Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has been particularly strong in promoting kindergarten education and has already issued a notice to various counties to continue employing graduates of the school and introduce new students.</p>
<h3>Yutang Cooperative Holds General Meeting of Members</h3>
<p>Amending the Articles of Association and Electing Supervisors</p>
<p>Distributing Profits and Holding a Social Gathering</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yutang Agricultural Production, Transportation, and Sales Cooperative, which also engages in purchasing, utilization, credit, and guarantee, was founded in the 19th year of the Republic under the advocacy and organization of Mr. Niu Yangsheng, and Mr. Feng Zanyuan and Mr. Min Zhongji were selected and dispatched by the former Department of Agriculture and Mining of Jiangsu Province to design and guide its promotion. Since then, the foundation has become more solid and the scale has become wider. Not only is it a model in various counties of Shanghai and Songjiang, but it has also been assessed as the first among the 61 counties in Jiangsu Province by the Provincial Department of Construction. Recently, the cooperative added large-scale oil extraction equipment in the utilization department and implemented production cooperation, hoping to link all aspects of the business into one piece, accelerate the cooperative function, and assist in the improvement of rural undertakings.

<p>38 to 35 Victory Over the Jews Again</p>
<p>One Class C Game Tonight at the Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>The Tax Bureau basketball team won the Class B championship of the Xiqing basketball tournament this year. Last night, in the second final against the Jews, the Tax Bureau won again with a score of 38 to 35. The Tax Bureau has won twice in a row, so the third final tonight will no longer be held. The order of events for tonight is only one game: at 6:45 PM, Class C, Shanghai University High School Affiliated School vs. US Public School. This year's Xiqing men's basketball tournament will also close tonight. Last night's second battle between the Tax Bureau and the Jews was still extremely tense. The Jewish forward was unusually valiant, but unfortunately, he was inaccurate in shooting. Otherwise, the Tax Bureau would have lost. The Jewish defense, however, was like an open door. After the score was tied twice at 15-17 in the first half, the Jews scored another two points, taking the lead with 19 to 17. In the second half, the Tax Bureau calmly responded and was able to overtake the lead. However, at 27 to 26, the Jews scored another point. At this time, the Jewish guard M. Gabelman was ejected, and the Tax Bureau scored four consecutive points to take the lead. The Jews eventually finished the game with four players.</p>

<p>[P Liangjiang Basketball Team Returns to Shanghai from Qingpu</p>
<p>Two Matches in Qingpu Cause a Sensation Throughout the City</p>
<p>Returned Yesterday Afternoon to Prepare for Match Against Bank of China Team</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Basketball Team was previously invited by the Qingpu Qing Merchant Sports Association to compete in Qingpu. Upon arrival, dozens of representatives from the Qing Merchant Sports Association and various organizations welcomed them at the pier, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Welcome slogans were posted all over the city, a spectacular sight to behold. That afternoon, they played against the Jiang team of the Qing Merchant Sports Association at the public sports field. Qingpu currently does not have a women's basketball team; the existing Hongyuan team is composed of men and dominates the Qingpu basketball scene. The entire city of Qingpu came to watch the match that day, and many people from nearby towns also came, totaling about three to four thousand people. The Liangjiang team is the only strong women's basketball team in the country and enjoys a great reputation. Their visit to Qingpu for the competition was a rare opportunity, and people from all walks of life wanted to witness the team's skills and players' style, considering it a treat. Therefore, the crowd was unprecedentedly large. County Magistrate Qian kicked off the game, and the two sides fought fiercely. In the end, Qing Merchant won 26-16. The next day, they played against the Qing Merchant Yuan team, and even more people came to watch, reaching as many as five thousand. Even the entertainment venues were closed because crowds flocked to watch the basketball game, demonstrating the enthusiastic atmosphere. In the end, Liangjiang won 49-35. The team returned to Shanghai yesterday to prepare for the match against the Bank of China. It is reported that various Qingpu organizations, such as the county government, county party headquarters, education bureau, education association, women's association, farmers' bank, and other groups, presented souvenirs to the team upon their departure. This trip was of great significance and will promote the development of women's sports in the interior, which is also the intention. [P German-Polish International Sports &gt;</p>
<p>Poles Win in Football and Boxing</p>
<p>Germans Have More Balanced Talent in Track and Field</p>
<p>"Warsaw Correspondence" The German government has been actively promoting sports in recent years to strengthen the national physique as a foundation for military and civic education. Therefore, there has been rapid progress in various ball games and track and field events. Poland, neighboring Germany, is also striving to develop national sports, establishing a central sports hall and training sports teachers. The two countries often hold various sports and friendly competitions, visiting each other. Tens of thousands of spectators attend, further arousing the enthusiasm of the people of both countries for sports. The two sides have wins and losses. On December 20th of last year, the Polish national champion Krakow football team led elite athletes to Germany and played against the German national champion Berlin team in Berlin. Tens of thousands of spectators attended, and many people from all over Europe traveled to watch. The two teams fought hard. The German team was good at defense, but the forwards were less active. Poland was strong in both offense and defense. In the first half, neither side scored. After switching sides, the Polish offensive became more urgent. Each team was able to fulfill its duties and put on an excellent performance. In the end, Poland defeated Germany 1-0. That evening, the Berlin Sports Committee hosted a grand banquet to welcome the entire Polish team. During the banquet, both sides raised their glasses and cheered for Polish General Pilsudski and German Chancellor Hitler. The hosts and guests were very happy. The next morning, all the German newspapers praised the Polish team.</p>
<p>The Polish Waltd Sports Club, to celebrate its 25th anniversary, specially invited the German Berlin champion team, the Oberweisley Club, to compete in boxing. The competition was held in Poznan, Poland, on December 25th. As a result, the German team lost 2-14. The Polish boxing team is well-known in Europe and has repeatedly won victories in the Central European Cup international boxing competition. They have defeated Hungary, Germany, and the Czech Republic, and recently defeated East Prussia 11-5. As for track and field, Germany is stronger than Poland due to its balanced talent. Both sides are actively training for the World Games to be held in Berlin next year and will hold a sports meet in Warsaw this autumn to strictly select athletes to attend. Currently, the preparatory work is underway.</p>
<p>On December 25th, the German-Polish ice hockey game was held on the best ice rink in Katowice, Poland. The Warsaw team represented Poland, while the Berlin Braunpanjia Sports Club, which has a great reputation, represented Germany. More than ten thousand spectators attended. The two teams fought in the cold wind and on the ice. The German team was tired from the long journey and was not very enthusiastic, ultimately losing 0-2. However, the German team's proficiency in hockey should not be underestimated.</p>

<h3>The Voltage Withstand Issue of Filtering Capacitors</h3>
<p>— (Li Yuanqing)</p>
<p>Recently, I and a friend repaired several different styles of AC radios. Some were purchased ready-made, and some were assembled by ourselves. However, the faults found were exactly the same – all were short circuits in the filter capacitors (Filter Condenser) due to overload. Isn't this a very strange thing?</p>
<p>Commercially available radios, because they strive for compactness and low prices, have to minimize the size and quantity of each component. Therefore, it is only natural that their filter capacitors cannot last. But why do self-made radios also suffer from the same problem? That's a bit puzzling!</p>
<p>I guess that there are probably still many people who do not have a proper understanding of the voltage withstand issue of filter capacitors!</p>
<p>We know that all capacitors have a certain voltage withstand rating (Voltage rating), and exceeding this specified voltage will definitely affect their lifespan. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The voltage withstand number marked on the capacitor usually represents DC voltage and not AC voltage. If you don't believe it, try connecting a capacitor marked withstanding 500 volts to a 500-volt AC circuit, and you'll likely have a short circuit soon!</p>
<p>To explain the above special phenomenon, we must first talk about the AC voltage itself.</p>
<p>The so-called AC voltage is not as simple as DC voltage. Strictly speaking, if we simply say "AC voltage," it is meaningless. We must specify what kind of AC voltage it is.</p>
<p>Originally, AC voltage itself is a sinusoidal waveform (Sinewave Form). (See attached diagram.) Its value changes at any moment and is not fixed. For the convenience of use, people divide it into the following three values:</p>
<p>(1) Effective AC Voltage The AC voltage changes at any time, as mentioned above. In this way, is it not difficult for us to obtain a definite value? To solve this difficulty, scientists first specified that the value of AC voltage that can produce the same function as DC voltage is called the effective AC voltage (Effective Value of A.C Voltage). The commonly referred to AC voltage or the value measured in an AC voltmeter belongs to this type. Its value is approximately 0.707 times the maximum AC voltage.</p>
<p>(2) Maximum AC Voltage The so-called maximum AC voltage (Maximum Value of A.C Voltage) is the value of AC voltage at its highest peak, so it is also called the peak voltage (Peak Voltage). Its value is approximately 1.41 times the effective value.</p>
<p>(3) Average AC Voltage The average AC voltage mentioned here (Average Value of A.C. Voltage) is not the average value of AC voltage in a cycle (CYc le) (the average value of a cycle is exactly zero), but refers to a half cycle (such as C to D and F to G in the diagram). Its value is approximately 0.9 times the effective value.</p>
<p>The value measured in an AC voltmeter is the effective value, not the maximum value, as mentioned above. In fact, the maximum value can still be encountered twice in each cycle. Therefore, when using capacitors or any other components in an AC circuit, we must be able to withstand the maximum value. In other words, we must be able to withstand at least 1.41 times the effective value to be applicable.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it can be seen that connecting a 500-volt capacitor to an AC circuit actually exposes it to a maximum voltage of 500 * 1.41 = 705 volts! This exceeds its specified voltage withstand rating by nearly half, so how can there be no danger?</p>
<p>For example, the output tube of a certain radio is 45. When the plate voltage is 275 volts and the grid voltage is about 56 volts, and assuming the voltage drop in the low-frequency choke coil is 40 volts, then the effective voltage received by the filter capacitor has reached 371 volts, and its maximum value is 371 x 1.41 = 523.11 volts. Under this condition, if you rashly connect a 500-volt capacitor, it is natural that it will not last.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the external voltage is too high, or the transformer's waveform is distorted (Wave Dislortion) due to heat, its maximum value often exceeds 1.41 times the effective value. Therefore, for safety reasons, the various insulation materials used in AC circuits are usually based on the standard of being able to withstand 1.5 times the effective value. Therefore, the aforementioned capacitor should use one that can withstand 371 x 1.5 = 556.5 volts. You can choose one that is closest to this number and can withstand 700 volts. (Note: The voltage withstand rating usually marked on the capacitor is an advertising statement from the manufacturer. In fact, it must be discounted by at least 80% to 90%. Therefore, choosing a 700-volt capacitor is not too much.)</p>
<p>Also, heat will affect the voltage withstand number of electrolytic capacitors. Therefore, the position of the capacitor in the radio should be far away from the power transformer and vacuum tubes that generate heat. This point must also be explained in passing.</p>
<h3>Converting a Powerful AC Radio to Use Headphones</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of powerful AC radios, headphones seem to have become relics of the past. Those who equipped them earlier now discard them like waste. In fact, under many circumstances, we often feel the need for headphones. For example, when listening to music late at night, using a loudspeaker will inevitably disturb people's sleep, so it is better to switch to headphones for quietness. Comrades who like to play with shortwave, if they use loudspeakers to receive distant radio station music, often get nothing due to the weak signal. If they can switch to headphones, it is not difficult to get unexpected gains. If there are elderly people or those with hearing impairments at home, when others think the volume is adjusted to an appropriate level, they still cannot distinguish it. It is best to connect a headphone separately so that they can also enjoy it.</p>
<p>The following describes two of the simplest methods to make headphones applicable to any radio. The first method is to add a connection to the plate of the final output tube of the radio. A – Connect to the shell diagram Connect to one end of a single-track headphone jack through a blocking capacitor C, and the other end to the radio shell, as shown in Figure 1A. The jack can be installed on the side of the radio wooden box. If the output stage uses two vacuum tubes in a push-pull configuration. The two ends of the jack must each be connected to the plates of the two vacuum tubes through a blocking capacitor, as shown in Figure 1B.</p>
<p>When using, simply insert the headphone plug into the jack to listen. As for the radio's adjustment procedures, it is the same as usual. If it is to receive distant radio stations, only the sound needs to be heard in the headphones. A switch can be added to the voice coil wiring of the loudspeaker to turn it off. If the headphones are added specifically for those with hearing impairments, the switch can be turned on, and the loudspeaker will play at the same time.</p>
<p>The volume adjustment for the first method must be adjusted on the radio's original volume controller. The volume in the headphones cannot be adjusted separately, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, there is the second method to remedy this, that is, the headphones are not directly inserted into the radio's jack, but are replaced with a volume controller, as shown in Figure 2. The ab ends can receive the jack on the radio, and the headphones are inserted into J2. Adjust R to make the volume in the headphones suitable for the individual's needs.</p>
<h3>Amplification Frequency Differentiation</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>Whether it is a radio or an amplifier, if you want it to have sufficient volume output, it must have a considerable amplification device. Ordinary amplification is divided into high-frequency amplification (Radio Frepuency Amplifier), intermediate frequency amplification (intermediate Frequency)</p>
<p>Ampjilier) and low-frequency amplification (Audio Frepu ency Amplifier) and other three types. High-frequency amplification is to amplify the high-frequency radio waves emitted by the broadcasting station. After being amplified by the Zhen tube, the output is still high-frequency radio waves. The principle is nothing more than strengthening external radio signals to make the detection stage easier to receive.</p>
<p>Intermediate frequency amplifiers are mostly used in superheterodyne or super-superheterodyne radios. The so-called intermediate frequency has already undergone considerable detection. This item of detection is called the first stage of detection. Although the high-frequency radio waves have been detected, the signals detected by the human ear are still not audible. Therefore, the intermediate frequency is amplified here. And adjust the mutual inductance between the two coils, and then go through the second stage of detection before it becomes the audio low frequency. Because there are many adjustment parts in this item of method, the selectivity is extremely excellent.</p>
<p>Low-frequency amplification is to amplify the audio low-frequency radio waves that have already been detected. The amplification effect of this item is greater than the previous two methods, but because the adjustment parts cannot be increased, the selectivity is of course inferior to the previous method. If multiple stages of low-frequency amplification are added, the tone will inevitably be distorted. Therefore, in imported radios, low-frequency amplification is only used in one stage at most.</p>
<h3>The Latest Tone Control Method</h3>
<p>— (Li Yuanqing)</p>
<p>The usual method of controlling the tone is probably to connect a fixed capacitor and a variable resistor in parallel in the low-frequency amplification circuit (primary or secondary). When used. Reducing the resistance can cut off (Cut) the higher frequency tones. As a result, the sound emitted by the loudspeaker will be very dull. (Please refer to my previous work "Tone Control Method" in the 16th issue of this journal.)</p>
<p>"Tone Control," as the name suggests. Should be able to control the height of the tone at will. However, the above-mentioned tone controller can only delete the high tones and fully release the low tones. But cannot reduce the bass and maximize the treble. This is its shortcoming!</p>
<p>Western music has a high pitch and many instruments. Whenever twenty or thirty people play together, the sound is loud and there is a lot of noise. Therefore, high-pitched sound waves must be deleted before they can be pleasant to the ear. Chinese music is not like this. For example, a Dan actor sings with a Jinghu. It is usually monotonous. If the above-mentioned tone controller is added, then the listener will think that he is pulling a broken Huqin and drinking a buzzing nose. This is the difference in the organization of Chinese and Western music and the hearing of Chinese and Western people. Do not force them to merge.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a new type of tone controller in the British Amateur Wireless magazine. But it can remedy the above shortcomings, so I translated it concisely for the same good.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, L is a choke coil of 3 to 4bv. C is a fixed capacitor of 0.1mf. R is a potentiometer of 10,000 ohms (all connected in parallel in the primary coil of the low-frequency transformer, as shown in the dotted line in the attached figure). When the potentiometer R stops at the center point, this device has little effect. At this time, the tone emitted by the loudspeaker is moderate. When R is rotated to the right, all the higher frequency tones escape from C, and the sound emitted is very dull. When R is rotated to the left, all the lower frequency tones escape from L, and the sound emitted can be very vibrant.</p>
<h3>Another Method to Increase Selectivity</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where there are many radio stations, the issue of selectivity is indeed difficult to solve. Except for multi-stage high-frequency adjustment and superheterodyne radios with better selectivity, the selectivity of ordinary line radios is particularly bad, and even four or five are mixed together. In addition to shortening the antenna, reducing the primary coil, and adjusting the antenna loop, there seems to be no other way to eliminate the above-mentioned problems. Now the author will introduce an excellent method to increase selectivity, which I think will be welcomed by readers!</p>
<p>The circuit is shown in the figure. L is the primary loop coil, L is the regenerative regenerative coil, L2 is the external adjustment coil, and L3 is the grid loop coil (that is, the secondary loop coil). The selectivity is extremely excellent if designed according to the figure. The coil can be wound on a spider web board with No. 26 silk-covered wire. L must be wound more than ordinary ones. L1 must be determined according to the characteristics of the Zhen tube. L2 and L3 are each wound 65 turns. Arrange the sequences according to the figure, and fix the distance between them after appropriate experimentation. C and C are both 0.00035MF variable capacitors.</p>

<h3>Method to Eliminate Vibration Noise of Power Supply Square Panel Iron Sheets</h3>
<p>— (Zhou Wenhuan)</p>
<p>The power supply square panel occupies an important position in AC radios (although there are some that do not use it now, they are still a minority). The quality of its work (that is, no heat, no vibration noise, etc.) has a great relationship with the performance of the machine. The author recently repaired a machine for a friend, and his problem is what I am going to tell you about now. The machine was assembled from parts purchased by himself. The circuit is a three-tube powerful AC machine. The power supply square panel is also self-made. The volume and selectivity are not bad. The most annoying thing is that the AC noise is very loud, but after checking its internal parts, all the places where AC noise can be eliminated have been modified. There is no way to do it, so I was asked to repair it. After getting it, I immediately started the inspection and found that the outer edge of the square panel iron core. The iron sheet on the west week has a slight vibration. Pressing it with my hand reduces the AC noise. At that time, I was sure that it must be the thing that was making trouble. How to cure it? The method is very simple: just use white wax liquid (that is, something like a wax candle) and melt it and inject it into the gaps in the iron sheet. Once it cools down, connect the power supply, and the annoying AC noise disappears. If any of the readers have the same problem, please try it too. If you can add three tenths of beeswax to the above-mentioned white wax liquid, it will not immediately lose its effectiveness if the square panel heats up.</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in the Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Firm But Central Bank Opens Spot</p>
<p>Therefore, the Drop is Only One Yuan and Two Jiao</p>
<p>After the previous dynasty's excited price surge in the gold market, yesterday people's hearts were still good and the trend was also stable. Unfortunately, the market could not be consistent. The domestic market was very firm, but eventually fell back midway. The news of the Central Bank opening spots was beneficial. Finally, it was flat. In the early morning, the London silver market rose and the US market was flat. The forward silver price in Monterrey also fluctuated. Exchange rates were flat. London spot gold rose by five pence. The off-site pre-market trading opened at seventy-two yuan and three jiao, and then rose to three yuan and four jiao. This was because people's hearts continued to flourish after the previous dynasty's excitement. Fuxing, Yongfu, Yu Daf, Yongyuan, Maoyong and others sold slightly and declined. The Central Bank's listed price was the same for both the US and UK. The customs gold unit rose by six li. The standard gold price was 991 yuan and six jiao. The morning opening was flat. After the opening, it fell because banks were plugging in, but seeing low buyers gathered, it immediately rebounded. Although there was hesitation, the buying interest of major players was strong, and the bank eventually rose higher, still plugging in at a higher price. The sellers took the opportunity to move, gradually falling back. HSBC's listed price revealed no change for both the US and UK, and had no impact. Later, major players took advantage of the low price to maintain it, and competed at the two yuan level. The white silver balance tax was announced as unchanged, still levying 6%. The British exchange rate was calculated at one shilling, five pence, seven eight one two five, and also had no major impact. Later, the foreign exchange market continued to harden, and sellers moved from time to time, finally retreating into the seventy yuan range. After that, the supply and demand were balanced. There was a struggle after the drop. Then, the Central Bank stepped in, opening 140 bars from Tongfeng Heng at a price of 960 yuan and five jiao, and people's hearts were encouraged, rising back to 70 yuan. However, the selling pressure had not yet been extinguished, and the afternoon closing was still under 70 yuan. After the market closed, the Associated Press reported that the gold clause had been ruled in favor of the creditors by the New York State Court, meaning that debtors should repay in US dollars of the original fineness, and broke through the 70 yuan barrier, so that the subsequent market immediately strengthened. After the opening, although buyers were eager, it continued to rise, but the foreign exchange market was still loose and the supply was still abundant, and it fell again. Speculator Luo Da still had a buying appetite. After that, major players still sold at the high price. Indian silver rose by one anna, the foreign exchange market hardened, and it still fell, once approaching the 70 yuan mark. After hesitating, Indian silver shrank by four annas. The Associated Press reported that the Bank of China would ship about 600,000 to 750,000 yuan of silver on the President McKinley from Mexico on January 21, and that on the 28th, China Merchants would ship 500,000 yuan of silver coins from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Hoover. At this time, it rebounded again, but the trading was normal, the domestic market was still loose, and the momentum of the rise soon showed a hesitation. Now, after recording the day's situation,</p>
<p>The morning opening was 972 yuan and four jiao, a slight drop of four jiao compared to the previous closing. Then it was two yuan and a half. Yicheng, Hengxing, Yuanchun, Yuanyong, Fuxing, and Yong all sold, and retreated to zero jiao and seven li. Dadecheng, Daf, Fuxing, Yongdingchang, Yongli, Zhaofeng, Changrui, and Kang scattered households all entered, gradually rising. Yuanyaoyong and Fuxingyong tended to sell bars. The bank plugged in 4375 US dollars for February, retreating to three yuan and one jiao. However, because Yuanyi, Qingyu, Yuanheng, Futai, Hengyongde and others all entered, speculator Luo XX covered his short positions and rose to four yuan and seven jiao. Huabi came out with 375 US dollars for February. Wanxing, Fuxing, Yongheng, Dafa, Fayong, Yifeng, Hengxing, Hengchangyong and others supplied one after another, and retreated to two yuan and a half. Shunmao, Shenkang, Yifengyong, Yonglitongfu took the opportunity to enter at the low price, and rose to four yuan. Tianfeng, Fuyu, Fuxing, Yonghengchangyong, Fuxing and others sold again, and retreated to one yuan and seven jiao. Citibank took 25 US dollars for March. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuanyaoyong, Xingchangyong took the opportunity to enter at the low price, and rose to two yuan and four jiao. Then, because 25 US dollars for March were difficult to sell, Fuxingyong sold bars and struggled at the two yuan level. The white silver balance tax was announced and remained unchanged. At this time, the overall situation hesitated. Huabi came out with half a yuan in US dollars for February. Zhenggin plugged in 3125 US dollars for March. Yuanyaoyong, Zhaofeng, Hengchangyong, and Yongli Shunmao all sold, and retreated to 69 yuan and one jiao. Dadecheng, Yuanyi, and Chunyuanyong took advantage of the low price to take in bars, and rose to 70 yuan and two jiao. At this time, Qianchang, Fushunmao, and Hengyu sold bars. Ruixing and Fuxingyong entered, and struggled around 69 yuan and a half. However, the foreign exchange market hardened, and 3125 US dollars for March were difficult to sell, and Yongli and others still sold, and fell to eight yuan and eight jiao. Shunmao, Hengyu, and Tongfengheng took advantage of the low price to cover their positions. The Central Bank opened spot purchases at a price of 960 yuan and five jiao, and immediately rose to 70 yuan and eight jiao. Hengchangyong, Fuxingyong, Shengda came to sell, and fell to 69 yuan. Scattered households and Fuxingyong and others all took in, and rose outside 70 yuan. Ruixing, Bingxing, Hengchangyu and others came to supply, and fell to 69 yuan again. Dafayonghengyong took the opportunity to maintain, and rose to nine yuan and eight jiao. The noon closing was 969 yuan and six jiao. After the market closed, it rose outside seven yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opening was 971 yuan, and then retreated to one yuan and two jiao. Dadecheng, Dalian Bang, and Hengyu came to enter, rising to two yuan and a half. Fuxing, Yicheng, Hengchangyong, and Dafayong sold bars. 1875 pounds sterling for this month. The bank was willing to come out, and retreated to zero yuan and eight jiao. Dadecheng took the opportunity to maintain at the low price and stabilized. Speculator Luo XX continued to buy, rising to two yuan and one jiao. Fuxing and Zhengchang sold bars and went downstream. Indian silver initially reported a rise of one anna. Dafayong and scattered households sold, and retreated to zero yuan and three jiao. At this time, there was no rise or fall, and the hesitation was quite fixed. Then, the second Indian silver reported a small rise of four, four, and five annas. Wanxing, Fuxing, Yongshunli, Juchang and others all entered. In addition, the Associated Press reported that the Bank of China and China Merchants would ship about 1.1 million yuan of silver coins from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and rose to two yuan and two jiao. Dafayong, Yifeng, Zhaofengchang, and Chunyuanyong sold. The foreign exchange market was still hard, and fell to zero yuan and eight jiao. Fuxingyongdadecheng continued to buy, gradually rising to one yuan and nine jiao. Yuanyi supplied, and the closing price was 971 yuan and six jiao. After the market closed, it was extremely stable. The highest price of the day was 974 yuan and seven jiao, and the lowest price was 968 yuan and eight jiao, a difference of five yuan and nine jiao. As a result, it fell back one yuan and two jiao compared to the previous closing. The closing price, based on the Central Bank's gold standard price, rose to 991 yuan and six jiao. According to the closing price, it was about 20 yuan cheaper, four yuan cheaper than the previous closing. February registration was 963 yuan, and March was 970 yuan. The morning replenishment was 953 yuan, and the afternoon replenishment was 955 yuan. The red gold price was 972 yuan and four jiao. The spot price was flat and the trend was weak. The Tianjin gang sold 50 taels of March to Yingfenghheng, at a price plus 4.5 yuan. The after-market price was only plus 3.5 yuan, and there were still few buyers. This was because the Central Bank's appetite was sluggish. The Central Bank opened spot purchases of more than 300 bars, sold through the spot number Tongfenghheng, at a price of 960 yuan and five jiao, about 9 yuan lower than the futures price. With the end of the year approaching and the source gradually pouring in, the Central Bank's appetite was not smooth, so the opening price was extremely low. There was a lack of swap transactions. It was only heard that Yicheng gave Yuanyaoyong 21 bars for 7.3 yuan, but it seemed that those who were shorting in the 7.5 yuan range were pouring in. There were still 5,586 bars left in the February period, with a total of 21 long parties and 30 short parties.</p>
<p>The in-场交易was normal. In summary, Fuxingyong, Yongli, Hengjingyong, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuanyaoyong, Dada, Yicheng, Renfayong, Shengda, Tianfeng, Zhaofengchang and others were on the selling side. Wanxing, Futai, Hengdingchang, Yuanyi, Changda, Chunyuanyong, Dadecheng, Shunli, Tongfengheng, Ruixing, Juchang, Tongfu and others were on the buying side. Dafayongyuanyiyongyuanyaoyong and others advanced and then retreated. Shunmaoruixinghengyu and others retreated and then advanced. Dalian Bang and Wanxing jointly did more than 1,100 bars, hedging about 700. Shunli jointly did more than 600 bars, hedging about 200. The Guangdong gang Shengshengdahengxing entered and exited suddenly, and the transaction volume was still small. The total number of transactions on that day was 30,653 in the morning and 11,641 in the afternoon. The number of chips in the March period was 21,182, with a total of 58 long positions and 57 short positions.</p>
<h3>Banks' Selling Interest Strong, Foreign Exchange Market Turns Hard</h3>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, the London exchange rate was strong, with both near and far terms rising by 0.0625. The US dollar exchange rate did not change. The forward silver price in Monterrey rose by 5 hao to 3 li. London spot gold rose by 5 pence. The British pound against the US dollar and the British pound against the French franc remained unchanged. The US dollar against the British pound rose by 0.25, and the US dollar against the French franc rose by half a point. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price. The British exchange rate was one shilling, five pence, one two five, and the US exchange rate was 34 yuan and 875 (the January 8125 swap also donated a difference of 0.0625). Compared with the previous closing, both the British and US dollars were flat. The Central Bank's listed price was announced, and both the British and US dollars were flat. The customs gold unit rose by 6 li, with little impact. After the opening, the situation loosened, and banks had a strong selling appetite. However, the psychological outlook of Chinese merchants was prosperous, and it tightened slightly at one point. HSBC's listed price was announced, and both the British and US dollars were flat. Banks took advantage of the high price to plug in, and gradually loosened. Although Chinese merchants came to maintain it, they were outnumbered, and the process finally loosened. The white silver balance tax was announced and remained unchanged, which also lacked influence. The trend was hardening. Finally, the Central Bank opened spot purchases, and the loosening temporarily maintained. In the after-market, the Associated Press reported that the US gold clause had been ruled in favor of creditors by the New York court, and the psychological outlook of Chinese merchants was stronger. However, the foreign exchange market was quite hard, and banks also had a selling appetite. Indian silver rose initially and then fell. The Associated Press reported that there was silver coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong again. Finally, it remained flat. The closing selling price in the near term was one shilling, five pence, one eight seven five for the British pound, and 35 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the previous closing, the British pound loosened by 0.0625 and the US dollar hardened by 0.125. Chinese merchants hedged about 200,000 US dollars.

<h3>Calm Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market has gradually stabilized recently, and the market situation is generally the same. Yesterday's foreign exchange loan rate was 1 jiao 5 fen in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. However, the interest rate for the first day was slightly higher due to a slight shortage of funds. The initial opening was 5 fen, and then it returned to 3 fen, so the result was not much different. The transaction of drafts was still not smooth. It is estimated that the morning market had a turnover of more than 2.1 million, and new transactions of more than 200,000. The afternoon market had a turnover of more than 500,000, and the small general association had a turnover of more than 300,000. Foreign exchange mortgage loans took back more than 500,000, and new loans were made of more than 800,000. Foreign banks made more than 1.2 million, and banknote transactions recovered more than 800,000. In terms of issuance, more than 700,000 in circulating notes and more than 600,000 in marked notes were issued. Banks received and remitted more than 2.3 million in bills remitted by foreign banks, more than 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 4.1 million in various goods and foreign exchange miscellaneous items, more than 2.2 million in year-end settlements, more than 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, more than 400,000 in special foreign exchange, and 600,000 in withdrawals.

In addition, the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee's public bill loan interest rate on the 18th was 1 jiao and 2 fen per thousand yuan per day, and the public bill discount rate was 2 jiao per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Copper Coins Fell Consistently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign exchange was 853 yuan in the morning market, 7 yuan lower than the previous day. The afternoon market rebounded by 4 yuan, changing to 857 yuan, and the result was still 3 yuan lower than the previous day. The transaction volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign exchange also fell by 1 yuan in the morning market, making 754 yuan. The afternoon market rebounded by half a yuan, changing to 754 yuan and 5 jiao, and the result was still 5 jiao lower than the previous day. The transaction volume was 145,000 jiao in the morning market and 100,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 308,000 wen, 500 wen less than the previous day, with a transaction amount of 30,184 chuan wen, equivalent to 9,800 yuan in foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Securities Fell by 5 Jiao and a Half</h3>
<p>The Rest of the Bonds Fell by Little</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, due to reports that Chahar had more troubles, the hearts of the people who were already weak were shaken again. Many floating orders came out again, and those who went short on the market were very active. Taking pleasure in the misfortune, they continued to add more, and there were many temporary short positions on the trading floor. For a time, the selling pressure suddenly increased, causing no waves. The dull atmosphere of many days was opened up, but because the matter was rumored, and the future was unpredictable, there were also many who took advantage of the low price to cover their short positions. Initially, the selling of Nos. 38 and 48 was very strong, and people's hearts became more and more empty. Then, the northern gang covered their short positions, and people's morale stabilized slightly. Then, the 16th major short positions also covered their short positions, and people's hearts turned firm. The market's attention was focused on the Chahar issue. At this time, when the end of the year was approaching and the delivery was imminent, it was very easy to cause fluctuations. Yesterday's experience was that the foreign exchange loan rate was still 1 jiao and a half, and the atmosphere on the trading floor turned empty. The opening market made a small drop of 3 or 5 jiao. Nos. 20, 22, 38 and 48 and others sold very aggressively. The hearts of scattered households were empty, so many floating orders continued to come out. The 20th level has always been very soft, so it fell by 7 jiao and a half alone. In the second half of the session, due to the continued selling by scattered households, it continued to fall by 2 or 3 jiao. As for the 20th level, because the drop in the upper session was too large, it rebounded by 2 jiao, and the outer levels also improved by 1 or 2 jiao because of this. No. 11 on the trading floor had a strong buying appetite, and most of them had empty sleeves. No. 16 also bought in slightly, so people's hearts also turned firm. When the market opened in the afternoon, No. 55 suddenly had a buying appetite, and No. 16 continued to buy, and the market price turned firm unanimously, with most of them improving slightly by 1 or 2 jiao. At the closing, because there was no bad news about the future, people's hearts stabilized, and most of them continued to improve by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. As a result, most of the market prices fell by 1 or 2 jiao to half a yuan. Salt tax and Zhengliu still improved slightly by 5 fen, and the rise and fall were quite uneven. It was most unfortunate that the 20th level fell by 5 jiao and a half alone. The total transaction volume was 20,760,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparative table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Fluctuated Narrowly</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported yesterday (17th) that the New York stock market was unusually sluggish after President Roosevelt delivered his message, because traders did not know its impact on social legislation and business community. However, the market situation slightly loosened after rising in the early morning, then turned quiet again, and then rose slightly again. The activities were limited to stores and a few special stocks, and the ups and downs of major stocks were extremely narrow. The bond market was firm, but the market atmosphere was dull. Small exchange stocks tended to rise, and Chicago wheat showed an upward trend. The total transaction volume for the day was 740,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Slightly Fell After Rising</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be firm and gradually showed a stable trend. The rise in US cotton led to a strong bullish sentiment, and the bullish sentiment of Tongji and Tongcheng companies was even stronger, and the market was particularly tight. However, with the deterioration of the surrounding environment and the approaching end of the year, new buyers had little interest, so there was no new development in the market. The golden rooster resisted the short selling and continued to rise. The pre-market opening of standard yarn was firm due to the US cotton report and political news favoring the bulls. The far-term price rose by 25 to 28 pounds, which made the market sentiment even tighter. There were more scattered households resisting short selling. Each month rose by 2.4.5.7 jiao. The opening situation in the afternoon was still high. After shooting to the second and third rounds, it was heard that the spot yarn trading was flat, and the market price of Japanese yarn was low. The closing turned lax again, and the near-term fell by 2.4 jiao. It was found that Da Kee sold 250 bales, Yuan De sold 300 bales, Shen Kee sold 400 bales, Da Chang sold 450 bales, and Geng Feng sold 750 bales. Jun Chang sold 650 bales. Mei Kee bought 750 bales, Shen Chang bought 450 bales, Chang Feng bought 700 bales, Sheng Yuan bought 650 bales, Da Feng bought 700 bales, Tong Feng bought 400 bales, and Ming De bought 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>

<h3>Cotton Resistance to Empty Positions Very Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending well because there is a shortage of deliveries for this month. As of today, the cotton inspection office has reviewed and passed 700 bales of “fire machine” cotton and 1,000 bales of mountain coarse cotton, totaling approximately 1,700 bales. Therefore, those with short positions are not eager to deliver, and engage in active hedging. Simultaneously, the price of US cotton for distant months is rising sharply, further increasing market prices. Indian cotton White Raw Cotton District dark market prices rose sharply by seven rupees.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Deliveries This Month</h3>
<p>Before the bidding, the market opened weaker, but American cotton, which had been weak, suddenly reversed and rose, with distant months rising even more sharply. Indian cotton coarse goods fell, while fine goods rose. Although receipts for this month are not high, short positions are delivering too little. More than 80,000 bales remain to be settled. Short sellers, seeing insufficient delivery inventory, had to hedge actively, driving up the market. However, large short positions remained unhedged, with each month rising by one or two jiao. After the noon opening, it was heard that the Indian cotton dark market rose another five rupees and twenty-five cents. Market conditions were still good, but until the third closing, some profit-takers closed out positions. This month was unchanged, while distant months fell by five points. Sales were traced to Yuan Da, 1,000 bales; Tong Ji, 1,500 bales; Da Fu, 2,300 bales; Geng Feng, 1,500 bales; Sheng Yuan, 1,200 bales; Yi Kang, 1,000 bales; Shen Ji, 1,300 bales; Yuan Yi, 1,200 bales; Chang Feng, 1,000 bales. Purchases were made by Da Feng, 2,500 bales; Chang Feng, 2,600 bales; Xin Heng, 2,800 bales; Yuan Xing Chang, 1,700 bales. The highest price and closing price for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton News Favorable to Bulls</h3>
<p>Production Set at 10.05 Million Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the U.S. cotton market opened, dealers and foreign merchants bought in, and prices for each month rose by four to seven points. Subsequently, prices declined as bulls closed out positions. After the Secretary of Agriculture's announcement, market prices rose sharply. However, due to the uncertainty of the gold bar issue and large-scale selling, prices ultimately rose with purchases from local and New Orleans buyers. Some believe that to protect government loans, next year's new cotton will also be subject to new loans and maintenance of handling fees. The closing was firm. Spot prices rose 15 points, nearby contracts rose 12-13 points, and distant months rose 25-28 points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices up 5 points and futures up or down 1 point. Indian cotton short accounts were absorbed by hedging and long accounts closed out. Pingguo'er fell by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee. Original telegram recorded to the left. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton on the 18th is 247 rupees, an increase of 1 rupee and 25 cents compared to the previous day's closing.  Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Washington on the 17th, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace announced today that the cotton production target for 1935, in accordance with the Bankhead Cotton Control Act, is 10.05 million bales (each bale weighing 500 pounds). He also stated that cotton farmers are willing to abandon up to 35 percent of their cotton fields in exchange for subsidies (according to government requirements, cotton farmers must abandon 25 to 30 percent). The carryover for 1935, combined with last year's 700,000 bales (each bale weighing 478 pounds), totals 11.7 million bales. This proves that these bales were not sold in 1934.</p>
<h3>Heavy Pressure on Grain Futures Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices fell across the board.  Quotations for imported wheat showed gains of about 1 to 2 jiao in Chicago and about 1 jiao in Canada.  When the market opened, the strong prices for imported wheat caused many inside and outside the industry to take a wait-and-see approach.  The opening prices for near-term and distant contracts were not much different.  However, after the second round of trading, due to the lack of significant shipments from the local "ke bang" for this month and continuous selling pressure from factories for distant contracts, the market turned downward, falling by 2 to 3 fen compared to the opening.  At the afternoon opening, the opening price for this month was also unfavorable, once breaking through 4 jiao, falling as low as 3 jiao 9 fen.  However, during trading in distant contracts, buying from outside investors and hedging by short sellers caused the market to rebound briefly by 1 to 2 fen.  Until the close, trading remained active, with both sides holding their ground, resulting in a balance between supply and demand and prices remaining above the flat line.  However, industry insiders generally took a weak outlook due to the continued orders for imported wheat.  As a result, the January contract fell by 3 fen and 7.5 li, the February contract fell by 2.5 fen, the March contract fell by 3 fen and 2.5 li, the April contract fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li, the May contract fell by 2.5 fen, and the June contract fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Initially Firm Then Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a pattern of initial firmness followed by a decline after the morning opening. Quotations for imported wheat from both Chicago and Canada rebounded by about 1 to 2 jiao. At the opening, the strong prices for imported wheat created a stable market sentiment. However, after the second round of trading, the market sentiment reversed due to the decline in the flour market and the presence of hedged imported wheat in the market. At the afternoon opening, the near-term contracts were especially weak due to the approaching settlement date and the presence of many traders preparing to deliver spot goods. Distant contracts also followed suit with strong selling pressure. Based on the current situation, the low prices for imported wheat may continue to be unfavorable to the bulls. As a result, the January contract fell by 9 fen, the February contract fell by 5 fen, the March contract fell by 6 fen, and the April contract fell by 8 fen. Spot wheat prices also fell by 4 to 5 fen due to a sharp decline in standards and flat demand from factories. Shandong Guide Mingguang wheat was offered at 3 yuan and 8 jiao 4 fen and was reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>The drought and cold in the southwest of Chicago wheat are gradually being discussed by the general public. The market presents a situation where both rises and falls are possible, and neither the bulls nor the bears intend to expand their positions.</p>

<h3>Rice Market Stable in the South, Weak in the North</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, more than 40 sources arrived, totaling 7-8,000 shi of goods. Due to the sharp price drop yesterday, the market seemed to have bottomed out. There was some movement in sales, with local sales and buyers from Qingdao continuing to purchase 600-700 packages. Thus, the overall trend turned from stable to tight. Prices for late rice and various thick japonica varieties remained stable except for high-quality goods. Some local goods saw a slight increase. Dujian and Bianyuan, and other varieties, also showed signs of stabilization.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over 30 ships arrived from various places downstream.  Market demand for white japonica short grain was slightly better, while demand for thin rice and Bianyuan was flat, and demand for various superior grains was sluggish.  Market prices for high-quality white japonica fell by 1 jiao, and medium and lower grades fell by a small amount (1-2 jiao). Thin rice, Bianyuan, and Yang Dujian also fell slightly.  Merchants in the port were reluctant to purchase superior grains, indicating a sluggish market.</p>
<h3>Foreign Indica Rice Sales Strong, Prices Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign indica rice market saw strong sales of local varieties. Although new shipments of foreign rice continued to arrive, market sentiment remained positive. Foreign rice prices continued to rise in producing regions, and there were even rumors of order registration limits. Local buyers were particularly eager to purchase. Yesterday, 7,000 packages of spot goods and 1,000 tons of futures contracts were sold, primarily to inland areas through local merchants. Prices rose by another 5-6 fen compared to the previous day.  Local indica rice prices had initially risen due to shortages and rising prices in producing regions and were expected to be in high demand. However, they were affected by foreign rice and briefly fell. With the rise of foreign rice, demand for local indica rice has increased even further. Yesterday, local merchants sold over 8,000 packages of brown and various indica rices, and inland merchants purchased over 2,000 packages.  As a result, the market continued to rise by 5 fen. If demand continues to be strong in the future, prices may have to be increased.</p>
<h3>Soybean Shortage, Expecting Price Increase</h3>
<p>丨Foreign Firms’ Sesame Reaches the 10 Yuan Mark丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was quite tense because the soybean cake prices went up, and the sources from various regions were not abundant, the inventory was loose day by day, and the grain merchants were determined to hold up the prices, so both buyers and sellers shared a bullish view. Throughout the market, factories and inland merchants purchased more than 30 carloads of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans, more than 2,000 packages of Dalian Xicheng soybeans, one carload of Niuzhuang Bai Mei soybeans, more than 600 packages of Guide soybeans, more than 500 packages of Shashi soybeans, and one carload of Bengbu soybeans and Xin'anzhen soybeans. In addition, the local and inland merchants purchased more than 2,400 packages of Hankou Zha soybeans.</p>
<p>Sesame sales through foreign firms continued to be strong. Yesterday, Sassoon &amp; Co. had a demand for 1,000 tons, but only purchased 600 tons, and the market price reached the 10 yuan mark again, at 10 yuan and 2 cents. Jardine Matheson purchased 200 tons, and the loading price was also 10 yuan and 2 cents. Recorded by Jiang Bang, 100 tons were purchased in the afternoon at a price of only 10 yuan. The sales of spot goods through Dongyang Bang were not weak, so the market remained firm and stable.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Market: Soybean Oil Supply Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>丨Soybean Cake Also Continues to Rise丨</p>
<p>Recently, the market conditions for peanut oil and soybean oil have been such that, due to a lack of sources and a daily depletion of inventory, prices have been rising by a few cents per transaction. However, the market was driven up sharply yesterday by a continuous rise in prices reported from Dalian, and the market was eagerly seeking purchases, with merchants only able to supply a small amount to meet demand. As a result, peanut oil rose by 2 jiao, and soybean oil rose by 4 jiao. The overall outlook for the future remains positive and profitable. Since Shantou Bang inquired about futures soybean cake, the soybean cake market has been relatively strong. Yesterday, the current price of Sipai's soybean cake has opened at 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Nonferrous Metals: Difficulty in Improving Transactions in Pig Lead</h3>
<p>Transactions in pig lead have traditionally been most active with yellow litharge factories, paint companies, tin foil factories, and type-setting rooms. Since tea merchants switched to using zinc sheets, the lead boxes they used to make have also decreased in frequency, so its sales are not as lively as before. In recent months, the market has been extremely sluggish due to oversupply, and although the industry has made every effort to find ways and promote sales, the actual transactions are still difficult to improve due to the poor environment. The current market conditions of various merchants are analyzed below:</p>
<p>(Foreign Lead) Recently, frequent shipments have been seen, so the amount accumulated in outside warehouses is very full. However, the local "ke bang" merchants' business has not seen any movement, and the embellishments from local factories are also very few, so the quietness of the market is indescribable. Although the industry has made every effort to promote sales recently, there are no large transactions due to the year-end and tight credit conditions. The market price is estimated at 15 yuan and 2 jiao per dan, with little change compared to the previous period. It is heard that a small amount of trading is taking place at opening prices of 15 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao.</p>
<p>(Domestic Lead) Although the amount of goods arriving is not much, the sales are limited, so the market trend is also very sluggish. The market price is estimated at 14 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao per dan. If sold to retail stores, the opening price is around 15 yuan. Daily transactions are only sporadic, with very few wholesale transactions. It is heard that there are still large quantities of spot goods in Hankou that can be shipped within the month, so the local market sentiment has been very weak recently. It is expected that the market price may tend to soften in the future.</p>

<h3>Art and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhou Manya</p>
<p>Goethe said, "Art is but a lending of form." We can change this definition and say, "Art is a method of expression or presentation." Then this question arises: if art is a method of lending form or expressing presentation, then what does it give in order to express form? We can answer this: art gives "human consciousness" (Humanconscjousness) to express and present, and reveals human thoughts and feelings. Regardless of the field of art, pure and joyful communication, full expression of life, and beautiful presentation of form, in the creation of all beautiful images and pleasant sounds, is the initial and original function of art.</p>
<p>"Creating thoughts" and "revealing emotions" and giving them form, or finding the appropriate method of expression, is the subjective spiritual task of all art. In order to achieve this goal, there is a need for objective mediums, and in accordance with the criteria of all beautiful entities of this medium, "the wheels of art" (ThevihicIeufart), concretely speaking, are "writing," "tone," and all "stiff materials." The skilled driving of these wheels, and a deep understanding of their beautiful qualities, is the important task of the artist. Whether the experience is profound and the skills are adept can distinguish the degree of success of artists with the same thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>But we must understand that the artist, in order to express a thought or emotion, creates a certain model, which is not his ultimate goal. This form is merely a cumulative expression of oneself after a spiritual satisfaction. Similarly, the "pursuit of beauty" is not the ultimate goal of art, but merely an indispensable creation in the artistic expression caused by spiritual satisfaction! The task of art is to create an ideal world. All consciousness, emotions, tacit understandings, and qualities of life caused by thoughts are expressed in beautiful concrete forms. From this, we can know that the logical criticism of art requires us not only to measure an artist's technical ability and his expression of the qualities of beauty in the elements of artistic consciousness, but to go a step further and ask which part of the human spirit this artist has chosen to express in the form of creation. However, the thoughts contained in a work are not necessarily created by art, because human emotions and thoughts are often shared due to racial or conscious connections. For example, the concept of "divine sovereignty" expressed in "OIyumpiaZeusofpheidies", or the "great maternal love" expressed in Raphael's "ModomadiSanSisto", are mostly contemporary thoughts shared by the intellectuals. However, the artist's personality, his intellectual and moral characteristics, and the special path of his sensibility and thoughts, his personal attitude towards the materials that give him the concepts of expressing human consciousness, can all affect his choice of subject matter and the lending of form, and can determine the special form of the "beautiful model" he creates. For example, there are thoughts that are shared by the same race and era, giving the artist experience, and giving him experience is the decisive condition for the creation of artistic works, but his characteristics and the quality of his skills determine the success or failure of his works. What SignoIeei failed to achieve, Perugino succeeded and surpassed. Michelangelo is a profound writer, while Raphael is said to be the incarnation of beauty.</p>
<p>From this perspective, art is the artist's display of the analysis or expression of humanity to the masses. The subject matter of art contains everything that humans imagine, feel, sense, and do. Its depth is like religion, and its breadth is like life. But the difference between art and religion and life is that in works of art, the quality of beauty is attached. Without the quality of beauty, it cannot be established as something called art. The world of art is not a church or a school, but a wandering garden, a paradise on earth. He does not preach or preach to you clearly, but secretly and silently allows you to taste and contemplate. In the pastoral world of art, there is actually no mysterious or abstract thing, but some ordinary human things. "Truth" and "goodness" are transformed into "the quality of beauty" and manifest themselves in the world of art. Scientific and mechanical laws are not allowed to exist in the world of art. The world of art is a free world, in addition to the lively expression of humanity, it also gives mankind spiritual comfort and purity.</p>
<h3>Memories of Wandering in Guandong</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, I left the newly married Shen Ting, who was only twenty-seven days old, and wandered to Guanwai under an assumed name. The first stop was in Shenyang, lodging at the home of an old tenant farmer. They worked in a machine room there. A large earthen bed, long and narrow, was where both men and women slept. Besides the owners, there were several other villagers boarding there. They all made a living by selling vegetables. At first, I was not used to this life, but after a while, I could not help but get used to it. I did not tell them the truth. But I knew that they had question marks in their hearts about my movements. During the day, they went to sell vegetables and did not let me follow. I had to stay at home and chat with the old woman. Sometimes, unable to bear the boredom, I ran to the eastern suburbs to find my friends who sold vegetables. They seemed very worried about me and put a reed hat on my head, as if this could cover everything up.</p>
<p>I was waiting here for my grandfather's letter. The letter finally arrived, sewn onto the hem of a special messenger. My grandfather said that the matter was an iron case. Hope was like the sunlight that could not penetrate the dark clouds. He ordered me not to write home for ten years and told me not to act like a child crying for home. But I really cried like a child. I borrowed a pencil from a girl studying in a primary school through the bamboo fence and secretly wrote a letter home, putting a fake name on it and timidly dropping it into the mailbox.</p>
<p>A letter from my grandfather sent me thousands of miles away again. I transferred to Yilan on the banks of the Songhua River. Using a set of half-true, half-false words, I deceived a clan uncle from the same village and stayed with him. He was a clerk in the court, and his family was there too. The housing was too cramped, so he arranged for me to stay at the shop of an old Shandong fellow who sold noodles, two miles away. I asked my uncle to find me a job, so he ordered me to practice writing every day, as if the job would be in hand as soon as my writing was good. It often rained in Yilan, and after the rain, the mud on the ground was half a foot deep. Braving the rain and stepping through the mud, I spent the whole day struggling for food and lodging. On the way, I passed some dilapidated brothels, and some people, not knowing my suffering, leaned on the door and smiled at me.</p>
<p>My uncle finally introduced me to the court as a recorder. The department head gave a note, and the living expenses were fifteen yuan per month (Harbin dollars, equivalent to nine present dollars). Several colleagues congratulated me, saying that it was very promising to be approved for fifteen yuan together. They had been in the job for three years, and each of them received six dollars a month. I slept in the same room with a chief clerk. That person was stubborn but also an extreme hedonist, and his dumplings were filled with nine kinds of fillings. He drank all day and night, and when he was drunk, he cursed people.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in the department, everyone was nice to me, and the workers were also amiable. Later, it all changed. Important official documents were all pushed to me to write. I wrote carefully, but the more careful I was, the more mistakes I made. Every day, I wrote the names of criminals (to this day, I can still remember some long names of White Russian criminals) and heard the sound of shackles.</p>
<p>Three yuan were paid out for the Mid-Autumn Festival. After sending gifts to the department head, I had two yuan left. By this time, it had already snowed, and I was still wearing a lined coat. I bought some festival gifts with the money, braved the cold wind, and sent them to my uncle's house, telling everyone I met, "My uncle invited my family to celebrate the festival."</p>
<p>Young people and young people easily get close. I met a primary school principal, and in less than a week, I became his teacher. Half of my day was spent in the youth team, and life became a little more interesting. But in less than half a month, a letter from my grandfather suddenly brought unexpected joy and money. He told me to go to Shanghai immediately. After reading the letter, in half a day, I resigned from my part-time job, took out the money, sent a telegram to Shen Ting, and rushed to the ship. The principal was very surprised and sent someone to deliver a package of gifts to the ship, with a note attached, with very emotional words written on it, with my assumed name written on the top. As the ship sailed, I suddenly felt a little reluctant about the eight months of my life in Guanwai.</p>
<h3>Rural Education</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>丨 "Continue with One Son and One Daughter"</p>
<p>When the stars in the sky squeezed their eyes, and the evening breeze coolly brushed my face, I found myself alone again at the head of the Little Clear River bridge. The Little Clear River's waters reflected the paper lanterns on the centipede boats, faintly trembling with threads of light in the darkness, spreading out into the black expanse. Suddenly, water splashed from the bow of a boat, with a "splash" sound, causing the hens to cluck in fright.</p>
<p>There were no pedestrians on this thoroughfare, and the noise temporarily died with the darkness. I mechanically passed this way every day. When there was a moon, a shadow always accompanied me, but now, I had even lost my shadow. Fortunately, I knew the way well. More than a year had passed, making my feet familiar with the ruggedness of the yellow mud road. I was especially pleased that the dog, barking wildly in the darkness, seemed familiar with my scent and trotted past me silently. I could even hear his faint panting.</p>
<p>Although I lived in the school converted from a small temple, I still had to go to the west of the river to tutor the son of Squire Zou in classical texts. A rural school teacher was not as good as the curly-haired dog guarding Squire Zou's gate. That dog fulfilled its duty and had other obligations. But me? Besides teaching children and adults, I also had to work as a free tutor. Every season, when I received the salary Squire Zou deducted from the school land, I had to offer a thousand thanks and ten thousand gratitudes.</p>
<p>I dragged my heavy steps, the rhythm of my heart corresponding with the rhythm of my steps. The sound of water from the bow startled me slightly, and I walked onto the bridgehead.</p>
<p>At this moment, my eyes twitched in the darkness. It seemed as if in the middle of the water, there was a pair of corpses, rising and sinking, as they had under the sun. I could not forget the relationship between these two people and me, but at the same time, I was curious as to why the two people were tied together as if they had committed adultery. For example, today's event was truly beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>The night wind brushed my face with a slight chill, and I smelled the garlic stench from my mouth.</p>
<p>The pungent garlic smell made me think even more deeply of the man bloated in the water, the man with a scar on his head. He gave me the ability to eat garlic. It was during the second semester of my night school. The scarred man was still my student. Seeing me tormented by stomach problems, he forced me to eat garlic every day. I had no choice but to try it. When I no longer felt nauseous at the sight of garlic stains on other people's yellow teeth, my stomach problems could be said to be mostly cured. ······</p>
<p>After hurrying along for about a mile, I saw the light from my little temple. In the lightless environment, the kerosene lamp seemed very bright. I didn't see any late students on the road. I was very happy, thinking of them anxiously waiting in the classroom, and I quickened my pace.</p>
<p>I walked into the main hall of the small temple, and a burst of carbon dioxide immediately surrounded me. The bodies of the crowd emanated fertilizer odors, and their breath reeked of pickled vegetables, overpowering my garlic smell. They were gathered in groups of three or five, chatting idly, buzzing like a swarm of bees. Seeing me enter, they successively returned to their seats. Black hands unfolded earth-colored books. Although I was holding a primer in my hand, my heart was still recalling the scarred floating corpse. My mouth unconsciously began to introduce a story to our university students.</p>
<p>"I will first tell you a story," I said. "This eldest brother is called" a good student. This student is as old as you are. Some of you could be his older brother, some could be his uncle. He had never studied before, and he didn't want to study, but later he did business, buying yarn in the city in bulk and selling it to the villagers to weave homespun cloth ·········"</p>
<p>They all understood what I was saying. Although the hand-cranked spinning wheels in these villages were not as numerous as those upstream, they all had looms to weave cloth, and recently, their yarn was bought from outside, with foreign letters printed on it.</p>
<p>"After he did business, he hated himself for not being able to write accounts, but there was no place to learn. Just at this time, I came to their village to teach students, pulling students everywhere, bowing and begging them to come and learn to read, but no matter what, I couldn't get a class together······"</p>
<p>Some students laughed at this, as some of them had been brought in by my bowing and begging. For example, Liu Huzi, who is yawning right now.</p>
<p>"But there were still no students. At this time, this student understood and came to me, saying that the villagers were holding golden bowls and begging for food, not knowing how to take advantage. I'll help you. I'll tell them to come and study. Those who don't come to study will have to pay me an extra string of cash when buying my yarn······ This way, the school over there was established. Do you think this student of mine is good? We must remember: it is not enough to only make yourself good, one must help others to be good together, that is truly good······ Okay, let's read!"</p>
<p>For farmers, it is enough to tell simple stories like this to make them understand. Saying a little about the good deeds of the scarred man who helped me, I felt a little comforted. I planned to tell people about the woman tied together at an appropriate opportunity.</p>
<p>Educational books, I am looking for an opportunity.</p>
<h3>The Human World (4)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>After he said this, his face still held a smile, but I could clearly see that the hostess's smile had completely disappeared, and it could be said that it was very sudden. Her face looked even paler. I was hesitating, unable to guess what this was, when my introducer spoke again:</p>
<p>"Are you afraid? What are you afraid of? I'll take care of it. You won't offend Director Li."</p>
<p>My friend saw the reason for the hostess's change of expression, explaining her doubts, her face was pale because of this, because she was engaging in private business, and I was a public official.</p>
<p>But how could I be a certain section chief of the "Manchukuo Puppet State" Harbin Police Department? Why was my friend lying to her? Why did he introduce me like this? Now, making the hostess fearful and uneasy, it really was my fault, and it seems that this responsibility should be borne by me. Therefore, I immediately explained to her:</p>
<p>"No, I'm not from the Police Department. Mr. Cao is joking, don't you know his character? You can rest assured."</p>
<p>I explained this way, fully believing that I could dispel her doubts, but seeing her face, which had not smiled for a long time, I knew that it had no effect at all. However, she seemed to have made up her mind not to care about this matter anymore. I could say that she wanted to suppress this matter and not talk about it. Therefore, she did not answer my words, but said something else:</p>
<p>"Xiaoju, pour tea. Please sit down, Director Li, Mr. Cao, I have really neglected you this time."</p>
<p>Xiaoju was the one who opened the screen for us, or the one who lit the lamp. I initially thought she was a thirteen-year-old girl, but this time, waiting for her to bring the tea from the east room, I looked more closely and saw that she was at least seventeen years old. She had a face of a suitable size, neither ugly nor dark. Her body was delicate, but she was a little short. She put down the tea set, took a few steps, tilted half of her body, and said to me with a smile:</p>
<p>"Director Li, I hope you can help my mother."</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>My doing this made it seem like I really was a director of the Police Department, like I could really help them, or, to put it bluntly, not make trouble for them. I couldn't help but smile inwardly.</p>
<p>However, saying that the hostess was her mother was a bit intriguing. A mother is only eight or nine years older than her daughter, unless she is a stepmother. Then, their titles were based on their status as prostitutes, right?</p>
<p>The hostess lit two opium lamps, inviting the two of us to smoke. I declined, in order to avoid trouble. I simply said that I was, in order to avoid</p>
<p>Reasonable."</p>
<p>"Director Li, you are too polite. Are you afraid of disturbing you in the future?"</p>
<p>The hostess strongly urged me, and from the looks of it, it seemed like she thought I said "reasonable" was deliberately making things difficult for her.</p>
<p>She came to pull me, smiling, and I was a little embarrassed, my face flushed for a while. In normal times, I rarely had young women staying over.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Puyi Critically Ill</h3>
<p>— Unable</p>
<p>"The other day, news from outside the Pass said that Puyi was critically ill, and the puppet organization was planning a grand ceremony committee to discuss the issue of succession to the throne. Yesterday, news came again that Puyi's condition had not improved, and treatments had been ineffective. Puyi has decided to go to Lushun for recuperation on the 21st of this month. The grand ceremony committee has been organized by Shen Ruilin, the puppet government's minister of the interior."</p>
<p>According to this news, Puyi's illness is feared to be incurable. But what exactly is his illness? Is it a mental illness or a physical illness? Puyi has been a puppet emperor of Manchukuo for just over a year, and now he is suddenly ill. Could it be that he doesn't even have the fortune to be a fake emperor? Or is he suffering from a critical political illness, making him incurable?</p>
<p>It is said that Puyi is still mentally clear. He became a Japanese puppet out of necessity and because he was surrounded by a group of sycophants like Zheng Xiaoxu. Since taking the stage, all his actions have been restricted, and he has been monitored by the Japanese in every way. He has said a few angry words, "Others say I am a puppet, but I am not even as good as a puppet. I am like a prisoner awaiting execution." This tone naturally indicates dissatisfaction with the Japanese who are directing and manipulating him. The Japanese political spies, who are densely deployed, must know the origin of Puyi's illness, which may lie in this.</p>
<p>Also, the other day, news came that the traitor Zhao Xinbo had returned from Japan after investigating constitutional government and had been shot by Lingjia under the pretext of hosting a banquet. It was said that the reason for his death was that Zhao mistakenly believed the puppet organization to be a genuine country. Therefore, he criticized the Manchus in the puppet organization for serving the Japanese in everything, and was shot by the Japanese authorities. Yesterday, news came from outside the Pass again that Zhao Xinbo had not been shot, but it was learned that Zhao was now recuperating at 7 Minamicho, Shibada Ward, Tokyo, under strict Japanese surveillance. It was said that Zhao's illness was a mental disorder and he was on the verge of death. Thus, even if Zhao was not shot, his mental state was abnormal under strict Japanese surveillance, and his death would not be far off.</p>
<p>Therefore, Puyi's illness and Zhao Xinbo's illness are both caused by the same type of political bacteria, so no matter what doctor is consulted, there is no way to treat them. Otherwise, the news of Puyi's serious illness has been announced outside the Pass for many days, but he has not died yet. Then whether he is sick is questionable. Even if he is sick, he can go to Lushun for recuperation, which may not be very serious. Why is the Japanese side urgently organizing a grand ceremony committee to discuss the issue of succession to the throne? By closely observing these various symptoms, the cause of Puyi's illness can be understood without saying it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I expect that there are many traitors in general who have this disease. However, because of the illnesses of Puyi and Zhao Xinbo, the other illnesses are suppressed by violence, which is also unknown. Or because of the illnesses of Puyi and Zhao Xinbo, they have suffered a major blow, and there are more and more infected people. This depends on the strength of the bodies of the traitors in general and how strong their resistance is to determine their condition.</p>
<h3>On the River</h3>
<p>— Zhou Han</p>
<p>I am so afraid of sitting on ocean-going ships that I almost lose my soul. Whenever I think of sitting on a ship, I get a headache. I have already told you that I am going to Hankou. On the day I sent the letter, I was troubled all night by the problem of sitting on a ship. I asked a friend if there was a way to get from Nanjing to Hankou without taking a ship. The friend told me that there was, to take a train from Pukou to Zhengzhou, and then transfer to the Jinghan Railway to reach Hankou. This was such joyous news to me. I decided not to take a ship and go by the Yangtze River waterway, but to take a train through Pukou. However, on the same day, I received a letter from my older brother saying that since you are going to Hankou for a trip, why not come to Jiujiang for a few days first? Moreover, my sister-in-law also added a few words, saying that we have been separated for many years and she really wants to meet me, and that I must first go to their place, Jiujiang. To go to Jiujiang first and then to Hankou, shouldn't I take the Yangtze River waterway? Isn't it impossible to take a train, but only to take a steamer? This really annoyed and angered me. It has really been many years since I have seen my older brother and sister-in-law. If I don't go and see them this time, how can I justify it? And my clever little niece, I also want to see her. If I take the train to Hankou and then go to Jiujiang to see them, it is possible, but from Hankou to Jiujiang is also the Yangtze River waterway. There is no train there, so isn't it the same? There was no way around it, so I had to muster up my courage and board a Yangtze River steamer. The Yangtze River steamer I took was a large China Merchants Bureau ship. Friends said that river ships and ocean-going ships are completely different, especially since this is a large ship. At first, I didn't believe it, so I went to sleep as soon as I got on board, preparing to get so dizzy that I couldn't get up. However, river ships are really not like ocean-going ships. There wasn't even a ripple. It was really as steady as Mount Tai. In this way, I looked at the scenery along the river every day, and I was so happy that I felt like a child again.</p>
<p>You remember the Han River in our hometown, right? Once, I took a small motorboat from Chenghai to Shantou. Although there were also many fields on both sides, the villages were all neat, with tall houses. How are the two sides of the Yangtze River? From Nanjing to Wuhu and Anqing, the houses on both sides are all mud and bamboo huts, and they are in groups of two or three, not forming villages. Looking into the distance, there are one or two villages, but the houses are only a few dozen. Where are the large villages with hundreds or thousands of houses and tall buildings on both sides of the Han River? From this point of view, the provinces in the Yangtze River basin are really not as good as the Han River basin.</p>
<p>I think the most beautiful scenery on the river is the evening glow. Have you seen it? At about five o'clock, the setting sun slants westward. At first, several golden rays of light radiate from the white clouds in the sky. Later, the fiery red sun appears on the azure mountains in the west, rolling down behind the mountains as if panting. In my eyes, the fiery red sun is round and large, so large that it looks like a bamboo tray used by silkworm farmers in the countryside. That proves that my eyes are not good. Some people say that if people with good eyesight look at it, it is not so big, but only a little bigger than the Mid-Autumn Festival moon. After the sun rolls down behind the mountains, the clouds in the sky are even more beautiful. That is the evening glow. The golden clouds change into peach-red, then into violet, and then gradually fade, and the curtain of night opens. When the clouds in the sky are putting on makeup, the waters of the river are also holding a makeup dance party. The waters of the Yangtze River are originally ephedra-colored. When the sunlight shines on them, they turn golden, and then they turn purple-red. The water flows and surges, they are so active and beautiful.</p>
<p>On the ship, although it is quieter than the train? There is no noise of the train's engine, nor is there any shaking of the train. However, you know, the noise of the passengers makes me unable to be quiet. They set up several mahjong tables in the hall to play cards. Except for meal times, they play from day to night, from night to dawn. The sound of talking, the sound of shouting, the sound of playing cards. Sometimes, a loud shout startles me awake from my dreams. It's really annoying. Jiujiang is almost here. I'll tell you later. In short, the river makes me unafraid. But it also makes me unable to have any peace.</p>
<h3>Economic Burden</h3>
<p>— Jie Hua</p>
<h3>Tropical Bay</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>I live not far from the sea. If you go up a small mountain south of my house, you can see a patch of deep blue water through the gaps in the distant trees. That patch of water sometimes shakes up, as high as the treetops; sometimes it shakes down, until it cannot be seen; that is the bay. The tropical bay is very beautiful, there is sound and color there. The sound is rhythmic, and the color is harmonious.</p>
<p>The coast is surrounded by coconut trees. The road is in the coconut grove. Walking in the coconut grove is such an interesting thing; the tide ebbs and flows, drawing near and receding, so clearly. The wind from the sea is always blowing that way. The high wind blows on the tops of the coconut trees, and the coconut leaves sway, turning over and over, harmonizing with the tide. The lower wind brushes the weeds, and the weeds brush my feet.</p>
<p>I walk from the coconut grove to the bay, and the more I go forward, the more and thicker the sand becomes, which increases my interest. The coconut grove is so quiet, without a trace of human breath. There is only the rhythm of nature; the tide and the sound of the wind. The sandy road is so white and winding, and few people walk there. There are many unknown birds in the forest, and their calls are so harmonious; most of them are magpies, very lively and free, flicking their long tails as they jump on the ground. They are not afraid of me, chasing each other in twos and threes so freely, seeming to be arrogant, not noticing that there is another part of the animal world.</p>
<p>As I walk, I gradually feel some wetness under my feet. In the footprints of my feet, there is already some water. It was dusk. The bay in the sunset is unforgettable to me. Everything is in a rhythmic sound wave, keeping silent, not disturbing each other. The ones that can move and can sing, naturally give them a share of happiness, making them sing, harmonize, and fly. Some birds, probably seagulls, chase the waves as if they were living things. In the foamy part of the waves, they stop their feet, and when that layer of foam disappears and becomes another layer of waves, they fly up again. The scene is so leisurely and lively. It is really too natural. Only in that place can a person truly show his humanity, loving all things, loving the waves, loving the foam, loving the sea claws, loving the wind, loving the leaves············Everything will harmonize with his heart, and everything will arouse his respect and love.</p>
<p>The seawater gradually turns golden yellow. I think that if I look at the bay from the distant mountains facing the sunset, it should be another kind of fun. The patch of gold that can be seen through the gaps in the trees should be more lively, more vast, and more difficult to grasp. It is peaceful, and perhaps you can still see smoke and mist on the water. Smoke and mist will spread, covering the scene with a blur. That is very intoxicating.</p>
<p>There are no large ships in the bay, only a few fishing boats. They all drift back from the direction of the sunset. The sunset waits for them, and the sea breeze sends them off. Seagulls lead the way for them, and the tops of the coconut trees gather their songs:</p>
<p>Not afraid of the sea, not afraid of the waves, rowing the oars more. Pushing the punting pole more, rowing, rowing, rowing over the higher tide··············</p>
<p>So they row again, and the small boat rises and falls in their songs. The fatigue of the day may be eliminated in that tone. "Gua·········Gua," the seagulls harmonize with them. Then there is a burst of laughter, several loud conversations between neighboring boats, and then there are the waves again. Again, the wind. All of these have the sunset waiting on the beach.</p>
<p>As soon as the sunset sinks, the tide becomes angry.</p>
<p>The sunset at sea is also very beautiful, the entire sea of golden yellow, gradually receding. Finally, there is only a ray of light left on the sea; it is leaping. The end of the light is turbid yellow. Turbid yellow is gradually swallowed by the sunset glow. Then, the haze attacks, and the haze thickens layer by layer, turning into night. The night in the bay is vast.</p>
<p>In the night, only the sea water surges against the stars. There is no clear light on the sea, and the fishing boats are all tied to the coconut trees. I want to see the fishing lights rising and falling with the waves, but I can't see them. Only the sea water is surging, surging, like the original sea, without a trace of human breath.</p>
<p>I found a shop in the bay and stayed there overnight, listening to the tide all night. When the morning sun sprinkled another kind of brilliance on the sea, I said goodbye to the bay. I did not see the sea's morning makeup, I regret it very much. On my way back, I only thought of the seagulls flying so slowly.</p>
<h3>Xiao Xiao's Art of Living</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Jane Austen once said:</p>
<p>"What is the purpose of living in this world? Isn't it just to laugh at others sometimes, and be laughed at by others sometimes?"</p>
<p>This is the ultimate art of living. There are many discussions about the art of living in the world, but none are as unique and interesting as these two sentences. Living in this world is indeed just like this—and must be like this—to spend one's life smoothly. Since ancient times, how many people have taken life too seriously, resulting in being disliked everywhere, and ending up depressed. Some even fail to protect their heads and die unnaturally, all because they did not understand the original meaning of this art of living with a smile. Conversely, those who know how to laugh, even if they do not achieve rapid promotion, will always have no enemies in the world. Everyone says he is a good</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>In this way, their lifespan will always be higher than that of ordinary people. When they die, they still have a smiling face, and after their death, everyone cries out in unison, saying: "Alas, the world has lost a good gentleman!"</p>
<p>In today's world, the dangers of society are known to everyone. Therefore, this art of living with a smile is even more needed and more widespread. The strong men running on the political stage, who take laughter as a practical raft for living in the world, can mostly "do whatever they want". Many things that cannot be resolved are often resolved satisfactorily in laughter. Seeing that it is about to explode, they will definitely hold the "safely passed" ticket. The explosion of Yi Peiji's theft and sale of antiques is said to be mainly because his face was too rigid and he did not know how to laugh, offending many people. Moreover, those who know how to laugh not only can turn around in all aspects, but also have nothing to fear when the political stage encounters a change.</p>
<p>And so on. Those who mingle in small venues, such as ordinary institutions, companies, and schools, are also in the world of people who know how to laugh. No, in these small places, the art of living with a smile is even more popular and more effective.</p>
<p>To go one step further, even if you have old rice to eat at home, you must know the art of laughing. Didn't the ancients say? If you don't know how to laugh, "won't disaster come from the sky?" It is always good to be able to laugh between family members. Especially those who have a house full of wives and concubines must learn this trick.</p>
<p>Dear readers, do you know how to laugh? Living in this kind of society, you really deserve to die if you don't hurry up and learn this trick.</p>
<h3>Fireside Chat</h3>
<p>— Wu Pumin</p>
<p>Snow fell, and the stove in the room was lit early. The warmth in the room felt like spring.</p>
<p>People living in spring are intoxicated. But the snow is fluttering outside the window! It is the season of severe winter! However, people lying quietly by the fireside reading their favorite poetry collections are also intoxicated.</p>
<p>Occasionally, while reading a poem about snow, I happened to look up and see the snow falling outside the window. A sudden urge to watch the snow arose spontaneously. I put the poetry collection aside, stood up, walked to the window, and unfolded the white gauze curtain with woven flowers. Gazing at the snowy scene on the road outside, I couldn't help but feel deeply disappointed. Because it wasn't as beautiful as described in the poem, nor was it a vast expanse of white. As soon as it landed on the ground, it was ruined, turning into black, dirty water, splashing on the hems of people's clothes and being carried home.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I opened the window, a sharp gust of cold wind rolled into the room, and I quickly closed it.</p>
<p>"What cold weather!" I confessed to myself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I looked down and saw the pedestrians on the road, all wearing short clothes, as if blood was boiling in their veins. They walked fearlessly through the snow on the road, their heroic spirit truly that of brave warriors!</p>
<p>"How cowardly I am!" I thought, "Why did I close the window after only a gust of cold wind? Why do I have to hide by this spring-like fireside?"</p>
<p>When I sat by the fireside again and opened the poetry collection, two lines of poetry from my friend Mr. Zhou suddenly fell out: "Not a follower of fleeting favor, without a stove, how long can one endure the cold?"</p>
<p>I felt a sudden surge of shame and lowered my head to my chest. But this was somewhat like being intoxicated in spring! ·············</p>

<p>Clear streams unfathomable, a lonely cloud in seclusion, sunlight peeks through the pines, its clear light still for you. A thatched pavilion rests in the shadow of flowers, a medicine garden nourishes mossy patterns. I too shall bid farewell to worldly affairs, and join the cranes in the Western Mountains. Climbing with Gao Shi and Xue Ju, the Cien Temple Pagoda, Cen Shen's tower seems to surge forth, solitary and towering to the sky. Ascending the palace, reaching beyond the world, the stone steps wind through the void. Towering over Shenzhou, rugged as a ghost's work, its four corners obstruct the white sun, its seven stories brush the azure sky. Looking down, one points to high-flying birds, listening, one hears the startled wind. The continuous mountains are like waves, rushing together like the eastward tide, green locust trees line the road, palaces and mansions are exquisitely adorned. Autumn colors come from the west, filling the passes with a somber hue. On the northern plains of the Five Mausoleums, ancient and misty green, pure reason can be understood, a superior cause is our long-held principle. I vow to hang up my official hat, and seek endless enlightenment.</p>

<h3>Katharine Hepburn's Transformation</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>It is said that she has changed her arrogant and obstinate temper.</p>
<p>And has realized the importance of publicity.</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn's temper has changed, can you believe it? Her temper is strange and obstinate. If you say that she has changed her temper now, few people would believe it. Westerners say that the spots on a leopard will not change, and Chinese people also say that it is easy to change the landscape but difficult to alter one's nature. Now saying that Katharine's nature has changed, isn't that saying that the spots on a leopard can also move?</p>
<p>But this wildcat-like Katharine Hepburn, it is said that her temper has really changed.</p>
<p>They say that this is not a matter of one day or two, but a gradual shift between the filming of "Little Women" and the filming of "A Little Minister". It is said that the reasons are very complex. Perhaps it was due to emotional stimulation after the divorce. Perhaps it was due to the advice of her manager, Leland Hayward. But the biggest reason is probably the failure she suffered when she performed on stage in New York. In any case, this proud, obstinate, stubborn Katharine Hepburn has indeed had a turn for the better.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the publicity department of Aihua Company would get a headache whenever they heard Katharine Hepburn's name mentioned. Her every move was enough to hinder their work and make them feel embarrassed, turning their achievements to ashes. Her arrogance and rudeness towards reporters had long placed her in a position of being unpopular with the public. She herself thought that as long as her performance was outstanding, everything else could be ignored. Now the situation is different. The publicity department of the company has changed its attitude towards Katharine Hepburn, and now values and praises her. What they are most pleased about is that she is doing her best to cooperate with the company's publicity work. She has realized the importance of publicity value. This is a lesson she has learned from experience. She has read countless articles attacking her in newspapers and magazines. She has heard countless sarcastic and abusive remarks from film critics. Especially important, the harsh criticism she received when she performed on stage in New York forced her to admit the authority of reporters and drama and film critics, as well as the value of publicity work, and made her turn back.</p>
<p>Of course, this lesson is a cruel one, and her transformation is also a painful and unwilling one. It can be said that she turned back only after hitting her head full of bumps. Fortunately, she realized it early enough, and did not reach the point of being beyond redemption.</p>
<p>An important part of the publicity department's work is taking still photos. That is, the still photos taken after each day's filming, specifically for publicity in newspapers. Katharine used to be very unwilling to take these still photos. The company's publicity department was also most afraid of mentioning this matter to her, but they had to ask her to take them. Now the situation is different. Katharine is very willing to take still photos herself, often sitting for several hours without showing any fatigue. If the negative is not good, she tears it up herself, saying that she will reshoot it the next day. Isn't this attitude completely different from before?</p>
<p>Even her attitude towards colleagues and supporting actors is different from before. When she was filming commercials (that is, short films for advertising), she once said to the director: "Why don't you put the other actresses in first, and then add my part?" Promoting others instead of herself in "A Little Minister" is not only not something Katharine Hepburn would have done in the past, but also something that previous stars would not have been willing to do.</p>
<p>There was another time when she was filming a short advertisement, she insisted on inviting John Beal to film with her. She said that he was the "little minister" in "A Little Minister" and should be given some glory. This selfless heart and the all-out cooperation with the publicity department are truly commendable. According to the announcement by the authorities of Aihua Company, this wildcat-like Katharine Hepburn has indeed changed into a new person.</p>
<p>But whether a person's nature can be changed is still a question. A person's nature is certainly not like the spots on a leopard, which will not change at all, but the change of human nature may be a temporary change under stimulation, and will gradually change back. Furthermore, this may be the company's publicity to ease the negative feelings of reporters towards Katharine. Let us wait and see what happens.</p>
<h3>Review of "College Rhythm"</h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>STudenTour Nanjing</p>
<p>In Hollywood, treating movies as a game did not start today. At the same time, this playful attitude is related to the decline of European and American films as a whole. Furthermore, films like "College Rhythm" are not overly emphasizing business considerations, and therefore obviously take a joking attitude, bringing together events that easily excite or intoxicate people, and using them as the main expressions. For example, boat racing, song and dance, and students' romances are taken as themes that can sell tickets.</p>
<p>However, on the contrary, these events put together result in vulgarity and emptiness. In fact, it organizes an imaginary story, just joking around. What is even more regrettable is that it did not achieve the success that the authors expected. For example, the boat racing scene is not tense enough, the progress of the story is very chaotic, and the dance scenes are not enough to express the splendor of capitalist films. Among them, only a few love songs, although they are so-called decadent tunes, can gain good feelings among the audience.</p>
<p>We don't have excessive demands on American movies, and we have seen a lot of joking movies, but like this "College Rhythm", it is indeed not worthy of praise. When we can't find any merit in it except for hearing a few loud songs, then...</p>
<h3>Review of "Resistance"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>"Sniper" 丨丨丨 Carlton</p>
<p>After a series of old, mediocre, empty, shallow, and boring films depicting assassination, jealousy, vinegar-drinking, suicide, and aimless uproar that made people feel extremely bored and weary, watching this "Resistance" film could not help but evoke a sense of excitement!</p>
<p>This is not only because "Resistance" is a war film with intense, fierce, tense, and terrifying emotions, and a tone of explosions, assaults, misery, and tragedy, but also because it shows us a more realistic page in the midst of real-world turmoil. There is no exaggeration, nor has anything been concealed.</p>
<p>The story unfolds fifteen years ago. Groups of women throw flowers to celebrate the neatly marching troops. It concludes with countless white bones and snow-white crosses as the prologue to the film. Next, it depicts the stalemate between the Allied British and French forces and the German army on the "silent Western Front," where five or six hundred people are shot down by enemy snipers every day. In the helplessness of not being able to detect the enemy snipers' location and wasting bullets on shooting, two Russian youths, Slidin and Siberiski, known as sharpshooters, are transferred from the shooting reconnaissance training school in the rear to serve. They discover the enemy's secret on an evening of storms and terror, kill the opposing sniper, and drag the body back. Afterwards, the Allied forces launch a major offensive and seize much land.</p>
<p>At this time, changes occur within Russia. With the dissemination of revolutionary news in the "Pravda" newspaper, the majority of Russian soldiers leave the Allied trenches and return to their country. The two sharpshooters also take different paths due to their differing understandings of the war.</p>
<p>Siberiski, who returns home, works in a border railway repair factory, constantly training young male and female workers in his shooting skills. In a foreign invasion, Siberiski uses his excellent shooting skills to fulfill his duty of defense, and the last person he shoots is his former classmate and friend, Slidin.</p>
<p>From a screenwriting perspective, this script cannot be considered entirely perfect, and the performance also uses many methods used in other war films. However, its exceptional quality lies in its truthful and moving depiction of two different wars.</p>
<p>Several points are worth mentioning, such as the depiction of the lives between officers and soldiers: on one side, gramophone records, beer, singing, and the longing for women; on the other side, struggling on the line of death. Also, the decline and growth of the two individuals in the era are depicted concisely and profoundly through their origins and essence. Finally, the overly optimistic "no resistance" theory of the playing basketball youth and the verification of Siberiski's argument, etc., are also analyzed and contrasted in relation to reality.</p>

<h3>"Lakeside Songs and Dances" – Full of Laughter and Excitement</h3>
<p>— Yunmen</p>
<p>This is a grand comedy from MGM, introducing the latest and most innovative songs and dances of 1935. The entire play mainly depicts the lives of young people on campus. Most comedies inevitably resort to those boring farces or shallow jokes. However, "Lakeside Songs and Dances" is constructed based on modern trends and the symbolism of youth. We know that the symbolism of modern youth is the extremely lively pursuit of progress and enjoyment. Indeed, books as stiff as mummies cannot restrain the vigorous new life. Old concepts and outdated ideas that taste like chewing wax and erode the soul can never shackle our 20th-century minds. Those gentlemenly manners that prohibit impropriety should be allowed to adapt to the times and be used as poses on the battlefield. Those rigid moral principles should be allowed to decay into fossils. Therefore, young people must live vibrantly, walk the path of life, and nakedly pursue what they love. This is the symbolism given by the "Sea University" during its campus tour.</p>
<p>In addition to the old comedy duo Laurel and Hardy, there is a new pair of counterparts. They are the big-nosed rambling Dr. Jimmy Durante and the seemingly well-meaning Mr. Jills White. At the same time, there are twenty all-American standard beauties, all of whom are the most beautiful campus belles from various universities in the United States. Now that "Lakeside Songs and Dances" has been filmed, it can also be called a "Campus Beauty Pageant." The various song and dance performances are truly worthy of being the latest style of 1935 and will be popular all over the world. Moreover, the beauty of the world's great nature is also used as a backdrop. The most innovative and outstanding songs are "New Moon," "Carol," "Snake Dance," "Struggle," "Taj Mahal," "University Song," and "The Future is Long." The final scene of rowing races is even more lively and exciting. Therefore, "Lakeside Songs and Dances" is not only a must-see for students but also an excellent piece of art for those who love beautiful arts and songs and dances, offering a refreshing experience.</p>

<h3>Waiting to Marry (Forsaking All Others) (8)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Before Marilyn could call him to stop, it was too late. Durrant's pillow flew over with a whoosh, hitting the kerosene lamp squarely. The kerosene lamp overturned and immediately caught fire. A scarf hanging on the piano also caught fire. Durrant and Marilyn rushed over to put out the fire. Unexpectedly, in the chaos, the woman's underwear Durrant was wearing caught fire in the back. By the time Marilyn frantically put out the fire for him, a large area of Durrant's back had already been burned. Of course, from then on, Durrant moaned all night and no longer talked about love.</p>
<p>The next morning, Geoffrey and Paula arrived. Since last night, Paula had been worried because Marilyn hadn't come home late, so she ran to Geoffrey to ask for help in finding her. Geoffrey initially refused completely. Since Marilyn was so unconcerned about her own reputation, why should he worry about her? Moreover, since their decisive separation a few days ago, he didn't want to interfere in her affairs anymore. But then he thought again. Connie must be looking for Durrant now too. If she found them together, she would definitely make things difficult for Marilyn and not let her go. Geoffrey's old feelings for Marilyn eventually overcame his reason, and he agreed to go with Paula to find her. Geoffrey and Paula found the place. Geoffrey saw that the door to the house was locked and there was no sound inside. He couldn't help but feel jealous and said, "What a gentle nest!" Paula looked at him but didn't say anything. After waiting for a while, she said, "I have the key here. But we need to decide, before we go in, should we ring the doorbell or knock?" Geoffrey snorted and said, "When you encounter this kind of thing, the usual method is to split the door open with an axe." Paula said nothing, opened the door with the key, and the two of them went in together.</p>
<p>When they went in, Marilyn was just coming downstairs, her clothes all fixed. She was holding Durrant's clothes, intending to deliver them to him. She suddenly saw the two of them come in and couldn't help but stand there in a daze. Paula shouted, "Marilyn, darling, are you okay?" Marilyn said, "Of course I'm okay, what are you doing here? How did you know..." Paula said, "Mrs. Leiter... the woman who gave you the key... she made a phone call... she said it was really a strange thing. Of course, I told her it was okay... but, Marilyn, what is this about?" Marilyn angrily said, "Why do you listen to those gossiping women?" After she finished speaking, she walked towards the living room to deliver the clothes to Durrant.</p>
<p>As she walked past Geoffrey, she felt a little embarrassed and ignored him, walking straight past. Geoffrey couldn't help but say, "This isn't where I should be. I didn't want to come in the first place." Marilyn stubbornly said, "Since you didn't want to come, why did you come?" Geoffrey said, "I came because I needed to. You seem to have forgotten. Durrant is a married man, and if his wife finds out, she will publicize your affair in newspapers all over the country." Marilyn defiantly said, "Let her publicize it then. She lost her husband, so maybe that can give her some comfort." Geoffrey said, "What, she lost her husband?" Marilyn deliberately said, "Yes, that's right." Geoffrey grunted. Marilyn shouted, "What does it matter? Please tell me. I have my freedom, I'm white, and I'm over twenty-one!" Geoffrey also shouted, "And a fool! Who deserves a spanking."</p>
<p>Paula interjected, "Don't yell... um, who's going to take the clothes to Durrant?" Marilyn saw this and handed Durrant's clothes to Geoffrey, saying, "He's sleeping in the guest room. You take them to him." Geoffrey walked into the guest room. Durrant was sleeping on his back, half of the blanket had fallen to the floor, revealing the burned area on his back. Geoffrey saw this and couldn't help but feel pleased. He walked forward and pushed him. Durrant cried out and opened his eyes. Seeing Geoffrey, he shouted, "Old friend, old friend. Did you bring the doctor?" Geoffrey asked, "What doctor? What's wrong?" (To be continued)</p>
