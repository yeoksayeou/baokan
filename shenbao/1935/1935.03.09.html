<h3>英國國防白皮書之影響</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>英外相西門柏林之行期已定英德政府且準備盛大之歡迎並擬闢興登堡總統生前之住室以招待之乃在臨行之前夕希特勒忽以「感受風寒嗓音失常」請西門展緩赴德遂使各國報紙紛紛推測僉謂希特勒之病必為外交推託之詞其眞正原因實由于英政府發表首相麥唐納所簽發之國防白皮書其中有「德國重置軍備」等語因而引起德國之反響耳然推究事實此中關鍵果在白皮書之發表乎英德之接洽果尙有希望乎此大可注意之問題也</p>
<p>英國白皮書之發表不特德國輿論認為「不友好之行為」卽英國工黨議員亦以議笑之詞責難政府並聞將于下院辯論國防時提議彈劾政府之表决吾人固不必確言英德談話之展緩由于白皮書之發表但由白皮書之發表實可窺見各國感情之疎隔與夫國際糾紛不易徘解之一斑也　英國固常以力求國際和平相號召而最近西門之所以欲赴德原在完成其本年英法倫敦協定之計劃但觀所發表之白皮書則軍費人員俱有增加且謂「軍縮會議現已停頓德國已重置軍備而俄日美亦皆增其武裝故英國不能忽視之」又謂「英國政府認目前為軍事準備不可落後之時期」云云然則英國之所企圖者决非所謂世界之和平而為如何始可以聯合歐洲各國以對付歐洲或歐洲以外之他國耳所謂英法協定所謂中歐東歐公約皆不過此政策之表現而已　英欲謀歐洲之聯合除法意外自不能不顧及德國對德問題英法意見頗有隔閡之處法意雙方亦難十分融洽担繼法意羅馬協定以後之倫敦英法恊定尙不失為一篇佳作一方藉英法德意比之共同聯合使法國所切望之安全保障得有着落一方又允許德國重整軍備使德國所要求之軍備平等亦得實現同時法德法意間又有中歐東歐公約為之聯合歐洲之聯合若能由此告一叚落則英國便可致力於遠東問題此英政府之所希望也</p>
<p>然而就德國方面論重整軍備固其所願中歐公約所以防止德奧之合併者德國則加保留東歐公約欲維持德國東境之現狀則斷然拒絕此種態度可由德國之覆文及德國各報之論調知之惟法國認倫敦恊定之各條項為整個而不可分離者而德之拒絕東歐公約則又為蘇聯波蘭所深忌故德國之態度使倫敦協定有失敗之虞于是英外相西門乃不得不親自出馬準備由巴黎而柏林由柏林而再作莫斯科華沙之行以求再作事實上之商談焉　英外相此行各國本均予以極大之期望以為此次英德會商以後倫敦協定之機構當可成立不料於其臨行之時竟遭希特勒之擋駕無怪各國報紙紛紛推測對德國作種種之責難惟吾人則以為會議之展緩或由德國態度尙未决定之故或雖已决定而有反覆考慮之必要故德國不得不有此出爾反爾之舉耳至白皮書之發表雖足以引起德國之反感要非英德會商展緩之唯一原因預料此種會商不久仍將綫續舉行惟能否得有若英國所預期之結果則殊難斷言矣</p>

<h3>英掌璽大臣艾登演說　為國防白皮書辯護　英外交政策仍以國聯為根據　蘇俄波蘭正式邀英閣員往遊</h3>
<p>（倫敦）掌璽大臣艾登今日在斯文登演說、為政府國防白皮書辯護、謂英政府之外交政策、仍以國聯為根據、而視為所經計畫以運用此種制度之最有效力的機關，白皮書中所開之國防溫和方略、並不違背此種政策、英政府固願繼績經營、以增高國聯之權威、然英政府亦不能不承認各國非皆同具此目的也、今日之事實、為集合的和平制度今方在進化狀態中、非俟各國同具協力經營此制度之志願、則相信此制度之諸政府對於他國、並對於其自己人民、皆負有取最要戒備之義務、英政府現正竭力謀成一種解决、而平近數年來歐洲確曾增長之擾攘、恐慌猜疑野心三項、今使歐洲政治天涯為之黑暗、此為英國人民最所關心者、科學之發達、已使英國孤立之地位為之一變、雖英國人民政治之外觀、尙未經過任何同樣的變更、但歐洲一切事務、英國之感受影饗、已較前更為直接、昔日英國孤立時代所保存之比較分離的精神、使英國更便對和平有所貢獻、此旣與英國自己、且與歐洲任何國皆有利益者也、英政府對於歐洲等處許多國之增加軍備、深為滋懼、而英國之軍備較之戰後或戰前均見减少、例如英國海軍之噸位、在一九一四年為二百十六萬噸、今為一百十八萬噸、海軍將士已由十五萬二千人減至九萬二千三百三十八人、歐戰終止時、英國空軍為世界冠、今在空軍國中已降居第五位、至於英國陸軍、僅較警備隊聊勝一籌耳、艾登末謂、目前建議所需之經費、乃由於國防初步計畫、前曾展緩、以期國際妥協終必成功、而使此舉無實施之必要、苟國際局勢已有變動、則此國防計畫亦可加以修改云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門游德之期、已因德元首希特勒政躬不適而展緩、但英政府接到蘇俄與波蘭正式請書、邀英閣員往游莫斯科與華沙、英外相在下院聲稱、政府欣然接受此請、掌璽大臣艾登將有俄波之行云、議員問莫斯科之行、在游德之前、抑在其後乎、西門答稱、此事殊不强迫、照業業已議定之佈置、俄波之游、應在游德之後、渠希望此項程序不變云、同時擁護政府派對於工黨在星期一日辯論國防時所將動議之政府彈劾案、已提出一修正案、其文曰、本院尊重本國為國聯會員之責任、並期以國際恊定謀取軍備之限制、故承認片面解除軍備不能達此目的、而贊成政府政策、認此在人民保障上及國際義務實施上皆屬必要云、此項修正文、將由前外相奧斯丁張伯倫提出、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）現聞希特勒總理軍縮問題代表里本特羅浦不日將往倫敦、與英國當局有所接洽、按最近德國政府要求西門外相展期赴德一舉、曾在英國方面引起不良印象、大抵德國當局希望希特勒親信人物（指里本特羅浦）赴英之後、一天雲霧、皆歸捎散、此外德國方面似又希望西門外相來聘之期、不至過於稽遲、若艾登赴俄波兩國京城經過柏林之時、希特勒政躬尙未復原、則德國將深以為憾云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>土保邊境集中大軍　巴爾幹風雲又堅緊　希臘內亂方殷　聯認為嚴重</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）全世界今日復見戰雲瀰漫、致力於和平運動者、不得不加倍努力、以求息事寗人、據報士耳其已有五師之衆集中保加利亞邊境以大砲五百尊為其後盾、並稱、保國亦在希臘邊境集中軍隊、而希臘內亂方殷、政府軍艦猶正向克利脫島轟擊叛黨之根據地、法國軍艦已奉令駛往希臘、保護僑民、非洲之阿比西尼亞及意屬索馬里倫邊境、早已大軍雲集、而南美大厦谷之戰爭、迄今猶未停止、甚至巴拉圭退出國聯、亦所不惜、數日來古巴　生暴動、死亡累累、中美沿岸亦匪患遍野、國聯當局以為土保之爭、已成嚴重局勢、若干方面且以為與希臘革命實有直接關係、意大利積極備戰、隨時可以發動、在巴爾幹方面、可視為保國之保護人、如「歐洲之火藥庫」中一有爆發、意國難免牽動、若然、則世界各國卽將各自放棄其和平論、而出於一戰矣、茲土耳其對於保加利亞之指摘、並不否認、國聯認為非常嚴重、且保國之通知、亦並不援引國聯會章、要求設法解决、但說明事實而已、該項通知係由保國代表安東諾夫遞交國聯秘書長愛文諾、安氏謂彼願意代表保國、於可能範圍以內、不用武力解决士保爭端、惟通知書中仍正式指控土耳其以重兵壓邊境、據悉兩國官塲直接交涉業已失敗、士耳其代表赫斯努、則發表聲明、謂土國不過因保國集中軍隊希臘邊境、從事預防而已、同時希臘政府宣布、謂叛徒作亂、已將平定、目前雖仍佔據克利脫島、及其他不相連屬之地點、惟不久卽可消滅、據雅典所傳未證實之消息、謂希臘前任獨裁軍人普拉斯蒂拉斯將軍、現已在邊境附近、待機而動、然官塲方面絕不置信、希臘政府亦效法美國在歐戰時之方法、用飛機至叛黨負嵎之處、散佈傳單、告誡作戰士卒、謂彼等係受長官逼迫、故而作亂、如相約反正、政府決不追究、且能加以保護、實際上國聯當局未免過慮、因此等紛擾、各大國咸耳參加、惟星星之火、可以燎原、一有衝突、卽不知伊於胡底、是為可慮耳、（八日國民社電）</p>
<h3>希臘戰事劇烈　政府軍進攻失敗　叛軍夜間迭勝利</h3>
<p>雅典　希臘政府撲滅叛黨之謀、現已失敗、雖用各種新戰具、以剿亂黨、但亂氛仍甚熾也、夜間叛黨迭獲勝利、已佔據乞阿斯與薩謀斯兩島、政府恐叛黨利用其前所奪去之軍艦、故諭令沿海各燈塔一律熄燈、同時凡希人欲出進者、現必須先向內務部領取出境許可蹬、蓋當局不願國人出境參加亂事也、聞土布兩國已增厚邊界防軍、防止叛黨逃入其境、凡持武裝越界者、皆須加以拘捕、而解除其武裝、斯特魯瑪流域過去二十四小時內、砲聲隆隆不絕、迎擊東馬其頓叛黨之政府軍隊、現以巨砲轟擊敵衆地位、而政府飛機亦從天空擲落炸彈、叛黨以高射砲還擊之、同時復用砲隊向政府對敵、英帝國航空公司之游擊艇殷譬里亞號、經維尼齊洛之特許、開出克里特島、現已抵亞歷山大里亞、而克里特島之確實消息、始獲傳出、據該艇艇長謂全島人民皆擁護維尼齊洛、並確信必獲勝利、如不能得志於大陸、則維氏將宣佈有三千三百方哩之克里特島為一獨立國、而籲請國聯援助之、希政府飛機一架、對敵方巡艦阿維羅夫號擲落炸彈、擊死水兵二人、該艦旋放高射砲、射落政府飛機二架、沉沒海中云、時局嚴重已極、政府方面猶信不久叛黨必敗、但據中立觀察者之意見、時局有甚危險之可能性、政府飛機二十架昨日轟擊愛琴海之加伐拉口岸、並以機關槍掃擊海岸、歐洲列强刻密切注視希亂進展之情形、英政府鑒於形勢嚴重、已派軍艦「主權」號開抵雅典外之發勒倫灣、法巡艦凡爾登號今日已抵雅典口岸、尙有巡艦二艘在途、據羅馬官塲消息、意政府現研究保護希臘意僑利益之辦法、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>法財長主召集　國際貨幣會議　羅斯福注意英鎊低落</h3>
<p>（巴黎）財長馬丁今日要求衆院、從速召集國際通貨會議、考慮通貨之漲落、及結束國際間之貨幣戰爭、馬丁稱、此項會議、應致力於各種通貨之穩定、各國並應締結協定、以公平之競爭為基礎、調整各種通貨、此舉將避免威脅世界商業之通貨縮緊與膨脹計畫云、茲悉法國內閣、亦考慮國際金融之各方面、因其或將影饗法國之金本位故也、同時比京傳來消息稱、首相都尼斯、向衆院宣稱、渠已要求法國政府、參加一金集團會議、檢討現在之世界通貨問題、但首相鄭重宣稱、渠贊成法比貨幣之絕對平價、並要求衆院投票表决此事、比國在數日前宣稱、比國未見有改變金本位之理由、因各種出口貨、均有增加、全國無需實行通貨貶價、卽可抑底生活費用也、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）財政大臣張伯倫、今日向下院重申對於金本位意見稱、關於通貨問題、英國無需感覺片刻不安云、下院有人以國家現在及將來之趨勢就詢、張伯倫答稱、美法大國、擁有大量存金、操縱世界之金市塲、在兩國未發生經濟關係之前、英國不欲恢復金本位、張氏認英鎊最近之跌價、由於報紙推測內閣發生變動、及變更國家財政政策所致、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）比相今日在衆院宣稱、比政府已建議立卽召集歐洲用金本位國大會、討論近今鎊價低落所引起匯兌局面、此議已由法財長歡然接受謂法政府全體願贊助比政府之方案、比相並力言有關係諸國未可廢棄金本位、至於比國決不抑低比佛郎之價值云、此項召集會議之請書、已否發出、未經述及、按意荷瑞士現為用金主要國、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國疑英國操縱匯市、開始貨幣戰爭、以期將來根據金本位安定幣值、英財相張伯倫因此特切實聲明英國未有此舉、以釋其疑、財相對於英國用平準金抑低英鎊價格之說聲稱、平準金從未用以故意抑揚鎊價云、至於平準金近來如何運用、則財相不願說明之、因一經公佈、則將破壞平準金運用之價值也、財相又謂英鎊地位絕對未有可使英國稍感惶慮之處、蓋英鎊在國內之購買力、與三年前相同也、渠未改變國際貨幣標準以黃金為最佳之意見、但在現有環境下恢復金本位實屬不可能、非至一般狀况確實美滿、可使金本位恢復後、决不致再行放棄之時、吾人不能設法驟然為之也云、今日外匯市塲英鎊復形參差、白宮發表一文、否認羅總統有續减美元金值之意後、英鎊頗形疲弱、但美國平準金售出美元、英匯乃稍回起、至於英國平準金則仍未運用也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）華盛頓負責方面現頗疑英國故意抑低鎊價欲、迫美國安定美元價格、聞接近白宮者有一稱印象、以為據羅總統之見解、英政府之所以抑低鎊價者、根據一種理論、卽美國現需維持中央信用、及國人對於復興程序之信任、故不能再减低美元金值、以報復英國减低鎊價之舉動是也、衆所知者、羅總統現愼重注視英鎊之低落、並與其顧問考量英鎊低落在美國經濟上之影響、但羅總統完全立於以美國物品計算美元價值之觀念點注視此項難題、至於如何操縱匯兌、則非羅總統所注意也、羅總統似决計非至一九二六年之物價程度確已回復時、不欲作固定美元之計畫、查目前物價之指數、約及一九二六年數字百分之八十、衆覺此後物價上升之趨勢、當較前為緩、羅總統昨日所發之言論、仍引起有關係方面之種種推測、以為事態依然混沌、白宮方面雖否認羅總統昨有擬再减低美元金值之表示、但羅總統並未明白切實否認有抑低美元之意、不過對此問題一笑置之耳、以實際言、英鎊跌風如此劇烈、而美國應付之方尙未確定、故羅總統此時誠未能輕易發表擔保不再抑低元價之言論也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）據今日一週統計、聯邦儲備局所存貨幣金、上星期增五千五百萬元、本星期又增二千二百萬元、現有黃金共值八十五萬四千六百萬元、實業墊欵亦增三萬一于六百萬元、而達一百九十四萬七千九百萬元、而聯邦儲備局現有債欵亦增二百萬元、而至二十四萬五千二百萬元、其準備金與債務之比率、與上星期同、仍為百分之七二·四、去年此時則為百分之六七·八、儲備局所購票據為六百萬元、所存美國公債二十四萬三千萬元、與上星期同、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>希臘內亂　已死六百傷二千</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）希臘自叛亂至今、共死六百人、傷二千人、中央軍及軍艦最近兩次進攻叛徒之防綫、據稱政府軍俘虜叛徒七百人、其中有軍官二百人、希臘政府驅逐艦三艘、今日開砲轟擊克利地島叛黨前總理維尼齊拉之總部、同時政府勁旅隨帶機關槍及砲隊進攻馬其頓之叛徒、遊弋地中海之法國戰艦一艘奉令開赴皮納斯保護戰區之外僑、（八日國民社電）</p>

<p>上表所載、祇為常備軍隊、其餘數千百萬之後備軍皆未列入、而美國後備軍數、與他國相較、亦瞠乎其後者也、今日參院辯論最重要之一點、當為世界各國對於若干議員所發言論之反響、再參院通過此案之前曾有聲明、謂美國已着手建造軍艦七十五艘、並計劃於來年再建二十四艘、此點亦可注意、惟據稱、卽使海軍建造計劃全部完成、美國去條約所許實力猶不足軍艦七十八艘云、（七日國民電）</p>

<h3>叛艦五艘行蹤不明</h3>
<p>雅典　叛艦五艘於三日前離克里脫島、但究往何處、迄今未明、惟政府方面甚恐該項叛艦突然出現於馬其頓或畢拉育斯港而向岸上轟擊、蓋今晨大霧迷濛之中突然有驅逐艦一艘出現於海上、向薩隆尼卡港轟擊、此事頗引起京城方面之不安云、惟幸今日霧重、未能瞄準、故港內無甚損失、該艦於轟擊若干時後、卽行逸去、瑞政府為防禦起見、已將薩拉米斯海峽四週埋藏地雷、以防其他四叛艦之駛入畢拉育斯港、其他各地如薩隆尼卡港之港口、四周亦俱有地雷之布置、政府各軍艦亦已奉命加緊巡梭矣、再則叛黨今日復得一小勝利、彼等已將勒斯卜斯島佔領云、（七日國民社電）</p>

<p>雅典　法國驅逐艦「凡爾登號」已駛抵比萊港、與先在該港之法國巡洋艦「福煦號」及「都爾維拉號」協同保護希臘境內法僑生命財產、本日希臘國務會議、已擢升陸軍部長貢第利斯為陸軍中將、又本日英國駐希臘大使訪問查爾達利斯總理、對於希臘政府力謀維持公共秩序一事、表示極大之同情、並誠意希望政府能以最低限度之流血、使局勢早日恢復、昨日查爾達利斯總理向哈瓦斯社代表發表宣言、辨明共和制度、决不遭受威脅、叛黨領袖維尼瑞洛斯託詞保護共和制度、舉兵叛變、殊不值一笑云云、本日雅典通信社對於總理此項宣言、復加以申明、謂希臘政界絕無復辟之宣傳、且亦不能作此種宣傳、現政府謀鞏固共和制度、始終如一、查爾達利斯內閣一切舉動、恪守憲法、實堪稱為從來未有之眞正共和政制、希臘公民雖在法律限制內、均得自由表示意見、然絕無攻盤共和制度者、維尼瑞洛斯藉口保護共和、逞兵作亂、不但不能取信於人、且益足證明其叛亂行動、完全出於個人之野心、蓋維尼瑞洛斯之出身及其向來之態度、均屬反對共和制度也、目前維尼瑞洛斯及其徒黨之行動、與共和制度及人民自由、實屬背道而馳云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>昨晨浦江內輪駁互撞　鐵駁沉沒江順受損</h3>
<p>招商局長江輸江順號、前晨由滬赴漢、行至瑞容廠前、與會德豐拖駁互撞、鐵駁立時沉沒、江順退回碼頭檢騐、今晨照常赴漢、俟下班到滬、再行大修、詳情如下、</p>
<p>江順赴漢</p>
<p>江順輪裝貨　一萬八千五百五十六件、搭載頭等室官房艙客八十三人、統艙客一千餘人、於前日夜中、卽昨晨四時四十五分、離開金利源碼頭、當在浦江行駛時、船主麥克溫W．Mcllwani祇開半車、及船身轉過陸家嘴、駛抵瑞容船廠前、第十及十一號河筒處、其時太古公司長江船蕪湖號、亦同時出口、開行在先、江順在蕪湖輪之後、向前行駛、此』時江面尙黑、但見對面有一外洋船懸有紅燈三盞、正在開駛進浦、</p>
<p>外輪來滬</p>
<p>江順駛抵　號河筒前、船主麥克溫瞥見對面有一裝載木板來滬之外輪、船名亞爾摩號Alnmoor、懸掛紅燈三盞、由吳淞所雇領港外人傳爾明Fleming引帶進口、駛到該處、在亞爾摩號木船之前、有會德豐大號鐵駁一艘、船名為亞爾平號、其形式似係備拖該運木輪者、但太古蕪湖輪通過該處、鐵駁尙未橫進、江順輸跟蹤前駛、詎該鐵駁船身、已突向江順船頭前橫駛而來、</p>
<p>兩輪互撞</p>
<p>鐵駁向江順船頭　前橫進時、江順輪發見鐵駁之紅燈在左、綠燈在右、其時正當漲水、江順急拉一回聲、未有回答及拉第二次回聲時、鐵駁將近船頭、江順急停車、並打快倒車、而已不及避讓、此時鐵駁右舷、向江順猛撞、其時正值五時左右、猛然一撞、江順船頭之右側、已與此大鐵駁碰撞、此乃當時肇禍之情形也、</p>
<p>下沉甚速</p>
<p>一撞之下、亞爾平號鐵駁船身、竟在江順船頭右側撞進、致鐵駁船身、套在江順右首鐵錨勾上、此時江順船主麥克溫、曾向鐵駁船員詢問、駁船浸水否、駁船上全部船員水手工人、至是始見江水狂冲進艙、幸船體為江順右錨勾住、可不卽下沉、乃紛紛放舢板逃生、一部分水手船員、卽躍入江順輸內、得未有一人喪生、但依照江順大副李國三主張、乘勢擬將該駁送到江邊、使擱在淺灘、詎料船身稍移、受潮水之衝激、　駁脫出鐵錨、立卽橫覆浦江、祗四分鐘、便卽下沉、</p>
<p>江順損失</p>
<p>江順輪幸打倒車快速、故僅船頭撞一大洞、鐵板裂破七塊、右舷錨洞已全毀、錨練亦損壞、船頭之二層台甲、亦盡行撞壞、龍骨亦損、又因鐵駁倒沉之際、船上桅木打落時、乃將駕駛台之坡璃窗等亦打壞、損害極重、據江順船上人員言、如果倒車較遲、而被撞在二艙間者、實江順早截作兩段、全船二千數百人、將盡落江中、幸船主見幾、未肇大慘禍、大幸也、江順立卽退歸金利源碼頭、至六時十分停泊、船主卽向總局江海關等報告、</p>
<p>今日仍開</p>
<p>江順船上旅客甚夥、載貨亦極多、船頭損毀情形、經總局派工程師總船主等上輸騐勘、以損失雖巨、幸在船身之上段、長江與外海情形不同、無大風浪之激冲、可無大危險、局方議定决令江順輪於今晨照常開漢、俟將船內貨客運漢卸淸後、再行返滬停班、入廠大修、决定後、便通告船主、准於今晨、照舊離滬赴漢、</p>
<p>將提公斷</p>
<p>出事後、招商局根據江順船主報告、已向航政局·江海關·保險聯合會·等報告、會德豐亦呈報海關·保險聯合會·派首席委員徐祖藩·會同航政局技師·到江順勘騐、關於責任問題、目前猶不能斷定孰是孰非、但較江順船方面言、係照正航綫行駛、鐵駁係當頭開來、航行慣例讓綠燈、此事將提公斷、總計損失、江順約一萬數千元、會德豐之鐵駁沉沒、該船約值二十萬元云、</p>
<p>海關警告</p>
<p>會德豐大鐵駁沉沒之處、在距十一號河筒、五百餘尺之江底、惟該駁船船身極長、有一百八十餘尺、且有兩枝桅桿、昨日沉沒之後、已由江海關在駁船下沉處、派舢板船懸燈停泊、以警告出入浦江之輪船也、會德豐方面、以該駁船身極佳、造價極巨、今次沉沒、尙可撈救、故决定進行打撈之手續矣、</p>

<h3>金融界　對交易稅意見　穩收必不豐但商業將受影響</h3>
<p>國聞社云、交易稅徵收問題、自經上海各交易所請願展期實行後、現在立法院審查之中、記者以此事與國內金融界實業界、均有密切關繫、特訪熟悉金融之某氏、承其發表意見、計分三點、頗為扼要、誌之如下、（一）徵收交易稅、有謂可取締投機、然交易所之交易、是否屬於投機、此最當注意者、交易所之重大任務、為調整市面、　市面之升降、基於需要與否、或直接受國際間滙兌之波動、即如金業交易所、純為調劑國外滙兌伸縮之機關、上海各外國銀行·及華商銀行·之做國外滙兌者、無不與該交易所有對講電話、前數日金價猛跌、即受英鎊低落之影響、英鎊美　低落、金價當然隨之暴跌、銀價當然因之高漲、反之、如銀價低落、金價當然高漲、此完全因受國外滙兌波動影響、非交易所所能左右、亦非任何人所能操縱、且在金價暴跌之時、花紗亦同時暴落、可見市面之外降、各業聲息相通、非投機可以使其伎倆、此對交易所之性質、首當認識者也、（二）微收交易稅、或謂可達裕國　收入目的惟裕國當先裕民、現在上海各交易所之交易、多數因受世界不景氣影響、逈不如前、如金業交易所、營業日漸低减、近來不做交易、每日最多不過十萬條、最少祇二萬絛耳、股東所得之利潤、每年雖發兩次、合計不過一分二三釐、將來且有更形下降之勢、交易所取於經紀人者、每條為一分五七五、交易稅初定為每條一角、超過交易所所得約六倍半强、其事實上之無力担負、自不待言、即以現在立法院所定標凖、每條七釐、亦約達交易所所得之半數、若責交易所負担、固屬過鉅、若加之於經紀人之身、勢必使營業愈形衰落、交易所本身不能立足而後已、且七釐交易稅、全年徵收總數、依目前之營業、不過十五萬至二十萬元、以雪裕國庫收入、渺乎小矣、增加庫收、為數至微、而使交易所生命發蹙、此值得考慮者也、（三）上海市面之衰落、至今日已臻極度、商業停滯、工廠關閉、洋拆高漲、地價低落、鬧市空房、觸目皆是、工商業與金融界、方亟亟於謀市面之復興、政府亦獎掖而扶植之、交易所與金融界實業界息息相關、牽　髮足以動全個局、萬一交易所因徵稅問題、而不能支持、市面當然更有不良之影響、且華商交易所、而不能立足、不啻為外人之取引所、夜市交易所、造機會、此尤不可不加以注意者、聞此次立法委員為交易稅問題、來滬調查、蒐集事實、頗為譯盡、審　結果、當能為調整市面之交易所、留　綫生機也、</p>

<h3>電影明星　阮玲玉自殺　服安神藥片至三瓶之多　醫治無效昨晚六時殞命　—玉碎星沉人亡影在—</h3>
<p>素負盛名之中國電影明星阮玲玉、最近被其前夫張達民所控告、刺激甚深、乃於昨晨三時許、突起厭世之心、在私宅中暗服安神藥片三瓶自殺、嗣經乃夫唐季珊發覺、立卽車送北四川路福民醫院求治、適值該院無夜班醫生、因之延誤一二小時之久、後乃送至鄒醫生處救治、經過六七時、但不見進步、至上午九時許、復請老靶子路中國療養院陳達明曁陳繼堯兩醫師設法救治、同時又送往蒲石路中西療養院、會同該院醫生急診數次、當時雖有數度稍見淸醒、終以中毒過深、於下午六時半殞命、茲將各情分紀如下、</p>
<p>前麝影事　創痛難忘</p>
<p>阮玲玉現年二十六歲、原籍廣東中山縣人、伊父早年逝世、家境淸寒、幼小隨生母久居滬濱、母以帮傭所得、供伊入崇德女校讀書、十七歲時、卽與張達民自由戀愛、在外同居、其初入電影界、遠在十年前、惟不甚紅、至民十九、聯華公司崛起華南、籠絡國內優秀電影從業員、製映野草閒花、阮任主角、於是一鳴驚人、博得國內贊譽、張達民　　　　輪船公司瑞安輪　辦、後張　　悄不睦、恊議離婚、阮復興茶難鉅商唐季珊同居、雙方本已無事、乃至最近、張忽具狀特區第二法院控吿阮玲玉侵占、復狀地方法院控唐季珊阮玲玉妨害家庭、而社會輿論對阮、不無徽言、阮回首前　、不無惆悵、而其芳名復登簿書、方寸間更為怏怏、刺戟旣生、乃萌短志、</p>
<p>清夜凄涼　竟萌短見</p>
<p>阮以受訴訟刺截、不歡者已多日、而中心時鬱鬱、卽寢食亦為不安、至前夜、阮迴憶過去、輾轉難寐、至昨日淸晨七時、竟萌短見、遂乘乃夫唐季珊不備之時、竟服安神藥片自戕、連服三瓶之多、分量極多、當時阮猶不為人言、旣而阮香鼾甚濃、沉沉睡去、面色則突慘變、於是為其夫唐季珊發覺、立急電請西醫陳繼堯等三人先後往診治、奈因受毒過重、須施用大手術、於是遂以汽車送至巾西療養院診治、</p>
<p>星芒淹黯　玉殞香消</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時正、阮在戈登路宅中、由唐季珊及三醫生、陪阮乘汽車赴西蒲石路中西療養院診治、輕車疾馳、芳軀呻吟、而唐季珊等在車中頻呼伊名、顧阮於斯時、已不能言語、徒為啞美人矣、十一時十分抵療養院、入二百零五號房間、陳繼堯等三醫生復會同療養院西醫、共同施救、奈毒量過多、病况竟不好轉、至中午、阮之脈搏、僅存一息、　　　　　　多、巳入彌留狀態、於是各醫生念為之注射抓氣、並為之打針、挽個此危險狀態、阮乃　佳、至二時半後、阮又轉入危狀、是時唐季珊之母、及聯華公司明星林楚楚等、均往探視、頻頻呼其名、而阮不能言、蓋知覺巳失、而呼吸亦至短促、又經醫生為之注射　氣、於是病况稍佳、但至六時、忽突趨激劇、各醫生設法維護、終以回春乏術、藥石無靈、延至六時三十八分、阮乃氣絕、從此一縷芳瑰、竟歸地下、</p>
<p>臨終一瞥　凄絕人寰</p>

<h3>香港特別銀牌半複賽　南華南竟遭慘敗　常勝軍一比三取於香港會　上半時獲一球但失機無算　下半時連負三球遂吿敗北</h3>
<p>（香港特訊）本屆足球賽開始以來、甲組各隊中、以南華南實力最强、所向無敵、不料位高則危、本月二日星期六對香港會於加路連山作特別銀脾半複賽、因馮景祥未能來港參戰、前鋒機會又屢失、復因守衛力異常薄弱、故上半塲雖以一球之利佔先、而下半塲竟被香港會攻陷三城、遂以一比三之局而敗、並失去本屆特別銀牌賽之準决賽權矣、茲將兩隊陣勢及比賽情形略述如下、</p>
<p>南華南</p>
<p>黃紀良</p>
<p>劉茂　李天生</p>
<p>梁榮照　劉慶才　梁現贊</p>
<p>伍寳渠　葉北華　譚江柏　黃美順　曹桂成</p>

<p>史杜蘭治　金布路</p>
<p>鄧勤　史堅拿　羅便臣</p>
<p>碧福　希路　侯活　花路　阜拉</p>
<p>上半塲　南華先勝</p>
<p>屆四時有半、雙方戰將戎裝上陣、南華南之靈魂馮景祥雖未蒞塲、南華先攻、互戰十分鐘許、香港會雖未失守、然已疲於奔命矣、旣而曹桂成得後方接濟、連破兩關、斬將直前、盤球至近門處、史杜蘭治已急足趕及、曹見勢不佳、立即將球傳與葉北華、舉足命射、適中金布路之腿、反彈而出、北華將球盤定、再度叩關、羅渣卒目送該球入網、斯時四週狂歡之聲、不絕於耳、皆爲南華慶幸也、南華先勝此球後、香港會各員未免心怯、陣勢大亂、譚江柏在中綫撥球直前、金布路大恐、竟獨自一人盤球直至界外、致負角球、由葉北華主踢、譚江柏頭椎迎之、但被維渣救出、桂成再踢角球、其勢亦妙、南華前　諸將、乘機將香港會大作包圍、但黃美順於門前三碼許命射、竟觸羅渣足部、反彈而出、其後侯活於苦戰中奪得球兒、偏交碧福、疾作叩門之舉、但爲黃紀良所接、未幾、梁榮照擇界外球、江柏在外呼應、但射球又觸門楣、仍無所獲、否則此時南華已勝三球矣、移時、球證銀笛一聲、上半塲遂吿終止、</p>
<p>下半塲　連負三球</p>
<p>休息已畢、繼續接戰、南華屢攻不下、遂被香港會所算、首由侯活渡過劉慶才防綫、傳球希路、舉足射門、紀良棄門搶救、卒將球拍出、怛因門空之故、終被侯活頭椎撞入、做成一比一和局、桂成擬急起直追、破關而上、傳球中路、江柏復以頭傳諸北華、再施頭椎、但又越界高飛、仍無所獲、旣而李天生位置太前、後防空虛、侯活又復驅軍來犯、挑球向前、紀良不敢輕出、致被侯活衝前、撞球入網、未幾、榮照見羅拔臣來勢太兇、勇出兜截、但被判犯規、羅拔臣乘便一脚、球到門前、於密圍之下、又被阜拉馳至、衝射入網、梁現贊趕回救駕、已來不及矣、至是距完塲時間無多、南華雖努力進攻、終無回天之力、遂以一比三之局遭慘敗、對於本屆持別銀牌比賽、亦無復有染指希望矣、</p>

<h3>耳膜保護法</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>—使用聽筒收音者請注意—</p>
<p>關於聽筒內薄膜保護的方法，本刋已屢有叙述，可是對於耳朵內薄膜保護的方法，却始終還沒有人談到！</p>
<p>其實，聽筒的薄膜，如果一旦損壞，修理尙易；萬一耳朶內的薄膜，因遭受過大的聲浪而受傷，那纔成爲終身一伴重大的憾事呢！</p>
<p>自從新式交流收音機盛行以來，似乎聽筒已成廢物，其實，在下述各種情形之下，用聽筒接收播音，依舊是很需要的：</p>
<p>（一）更深人靜時，欲避免同居或鄰人之厭惡。</p>
<p>（二）業餘家試騐收音機成績時。</p>
<p>（三）接收遠地的播音。</p>
<p>上述三點，尤以末一項爲最屬重要。因爲遠地傳來的播音，電力極爲微弱，有時在聽筒內可以得到極淸晰的聲音，可是放在揚聲器內，却音訊毫無可知以聽筒接收遠地的播音，是一般遠地收音迷（DXˉfan）所不可避免的一回事。</p>
<p>遠地電台電波之微弱，已見上述。所以卽使使用聽筒，也須將音量調節器開至最高點纔行。這樣，便極易有發生危險的可能。因爲遠地送來的電波，雖然非常細弱，可是近地電波的衝突，以及各種人爲的靜電騷擾，却依然會猖狂如故。萬一此時突然乘機侵入，試問聽筒內所發出的聲浪，將響至何種程度。著者曾以四燈長短波收音機，用聽筒在深夜接收美國紐約WOXE電台的播音，（週率15270　KC．）正在手舞足蹈，得意忘形的時候，却不料鄰近也有一位無綫電迷，也正旋到週率相近的地方，當時兩種週率，混合而發生一種週率差，聽筒內便聽到一種强大的狂呌聲，我立卽將聽筒放下，可是耳膜已大受損傷，足足隔了五分鐘之久，纔恢復聽覺。幸而所用的還是電力較小的直流收音構，如果是輸出力有幾瓦特的强力　　　，那眞更要不堪設想呢！（有人曾以兩只—45號眞空管接成推挽式放大，在京收聽中央電臺的播音，結果，揚聲器後面的玻璃窗，竟爲之震碎。交流機電力之偉大，可以想見。）</p>
<p>經過這次意外以後，對於聽筒，不禁望而生畏。可是因噎廢食，究屬不成事體，於是便想出了許多預防的方法，現在遂條寫在下面，還祈各位同志予以指敎為幸。</p>
<p>（一）在聽筒上並接一個五十萬歐姆的變量電阻器，當受到意外的騷擾時，立將電阻旋小。（注意一、通常收音機內的音量調節器，大槪總是接在檢波綫路以前的，如果雜聲發生在低週率綫路以內，該器便失掉作用。二、當聽到狂呌時，切忌將開關關掉，因爲收音機突然停止工作，聽筒內便會因感應而發生一下重大的「卜篤」聲，其音量更較其他任何騷擾爲響。）</p>
<p>（二）消極的防禦法，使用時祗聽一個耳機，其餘一個，將下不用。這樣，至少可以减掉一半的危險。</p>
<p>（三）當聽到狂大的聲響時，可急將口部張開，使耳膜內外的空氣，彼此均勻，便可增加抵抗力不少。</p>
<h3>週率不穩定的補救</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>一架小電力的短波發射機，假使週率不穩定，則不但遠程通訊成爲夢想，而且極易發生種種無謂的騷擾。所以我們寗可减小輸出電力，而於週率則應該力求穩定。穩定週率的最好辦法，當然是利用石英晶體，但是連放大級都沒有的發射機，事實上狠少會用到石英品體，而要另想辦法了。今略述如下：</p>
<p>普通最常見的週率不穩定，是機中另件受到外界震動而引起的。補救之道，當然在减免震動。機中另件完全改用製作强固而不畏振撼的，導綫換用粗硬銅絲，一切裝置務須堅强，發振部份應該用軟執執起，且遠離電源部份和電　。</p>
<p>機中的絕緣應該絕對良好，因爲有了漏電之處，不但週率不能穩定，而且影響到音質的淸晰圓潤。</p>
<p>眞空管和其他另件的發熱，亦可以影響到週率的穩定。减免之道，但須提高這發射機的效率；換句話說，就是在規定電力輸入之下，得到最大的天綫出力。</p>
<p>調節天綫電路，使略離工作最好的一點。這方法表面上似乎是一種損失，但是實際上是有利的，因爲這樣一來，天綫的搖動，可以不十分影饗到週率。</p>
<p>天綫及輸送綫（Feeder）應該充分張緊，雖在大風中，亦不可搖盪。</p>
<p>假使用交流，濾波應該十分講究。</p>
<p>總之，只要細心的觀察，和長時期有系統的試騐，則我們不難以極小電力的短波發射機，而做遠距離之短波通訊也。</p>
<h3>二極管檢波</h3>
<p>— 汪盛世</p>
<p>當三極管沒有發明以前，二極管做檢波工作當然是很適當的。不過到了無綫電突飛猛進的今日，除了用於整流的工作外，就少有人用到牠了。</p>
<p>但是用二極管檢波也有優點，一來是綫路簡單，二來祗要滴當的應用，不會發生失眞，甚至遇到調幅到百分之一百的電波，也能免去此弊。</p>
<p>最簡單的二極管檢波綫路如圖一，LC爲配諧電路，一端接到屏極，一端接到荷載電阻R，及旁路電容器C。</p>
<p>若收到的高週率信號未經調幅，則在R，上卽生一穩定直流電壓，因爲高週率的波紋已經被C濾去了。這電壓的值與信號的強弱成比例，假使二極管的作用完全（卽對於一個方向是流的總阻爲零，而對於另一方向電流的總阻爲無窮大）則這値大槪等於高週波電壓的最大値。</p>
<p>假使這高週率信號已經調幅，這直流電壓就在平均的位置上下變化，生出與高週率信號振盪相似的低週率。</p>
<p>所以現在R上發生的電流可以看做二部，一部是因主波而生的穩定直流，一部是因調幅而生的交流。由圖可看到因有整流管的關係，A點永不能比B點爲負。當一信號調幅至百分之一百時，則信號電壓爲零時，跨過R的電壓一定也降到零。</p>
<p>圖二，爲測定二極管在不同穩定信號電壓時的特性曲綫的方法，把電池E代替電阻R，用來表示跨於R上的穩定直流電壓。外來的信號可用低週率代替，以便測量</p>
<p>假使我把電壓E變化，而使信號電壓不變，則可畫出一條電壓對屏流的曲綫，表示二極管在這信號電壓下的特性。圖三爲在不同信號電壓下的一組曲綫。圖中通過〇點者爲信號爲零時的曲綫，這在實際上不常發生，因爲我們用的若是熱絲二極管，則雖信號電壓爲零時，電子也能從陰極跑到屏極去。</p>
<p>圖中×〇爲荷載直綫，其斜度（Slope）表示R．的電阻（設R爲二五〇，〇〇〇歐姆，則二·五弗打的電壓卽能產生電流一〇兆分安培）。</p>
<p>若二極管接到四弗打的高週率信號，這時的工作點在P。假如主波已被調幅，則電壓在這點卽生振動。設調幅爲百分之一百，這振盪將由P變到信號電壓爲零的曲綫，再升到八弗打的曲綫如圖。</p>
<p>在此週期內，R上的電流在信號電壓最小時恰爲零，因此知道這個簡單的二極管綫路，對於這種調幅到百分之一百的信號，實能很忠實的工作着。</p>

<h3>天線代替法的種種</h3>
<p>— 吳子佩</p>
<p>天綫是一架收音機的附屬要件，礦石機不必說了，就是一管機和多管機亦少不了牠，雖然有高放的多管機可以不用牠，可是效力總比用天綫的較差。</p>
<p>在鄉村裏要裝置一根天綫，地位是不生問題的，在都市裏和市鎭上那就麻煩了。要爬在屋頂上，又要請求鄰居的允許給你豎一根竹竿的地位，事情是多麽的繁贅；因此就有一般業餘家因爲給環境的逼迫，不得不向替代的方法上去想法了。經濟寬裕的可以多裝幾級高放，以省除天綫，可是這究是少數，一般的都徘徊在礦石機和一二管機的路上，那裏能多裝高放級呢？可是「成功」終給努力者獲得了。許多業餘者不斷的努力，結果有下面幾種的替代方法：有的已經在本刋上說過的，有的尙未說及，現在分詳略的介紹一下，以供一般的採取。</p>
<p>（一）用水落代替法，屋簷前的水落，都用鉛皮做的，亦能吸收和傳導無綫電波，用代天綫，效力不差，用的人很多，以其簡便而無危險。不但可代天綫，以之代地綫亦佳。</p>
<p>（二）電燈綫代替法：在有電燈的地方，就可以電燈上的花綫（軟綫）或皮綫（硬綫）代替天綫。用七八尺的花綫，繞在皮綫或花綫的外面，一頭接在收音機的天綫柱上，另一頭任其自然，這樣成了一根天綫的代用綫。這方法，在礦石機難收效，在一二管的收音機上，是有效的，不過靈敏度差一些。</p>
<p>（三）天綫代用器：這是一種現成的製品，市上亦有售。其實就是一個「撲落」，中間有一只耐高壓的雲母式的固定儲電器。效力極佳，比一般的室內天綫或環狀天綫都好·可惜價格不便宜，非一般業餘者所願用。</p>
<p>（四）室內天綫：在屋內裝設的天綫。這是現在最普遍施用的一種替代品。</p>
<p>（五）直接接在電燈綫上的方法：上面第三種的方法，實際上就以電燈綫爲天綫，不過中間接一固定容電器，使無綫電波能通行無阻，交流電被容電器阻住了，不能傳下來，人體觸在代用器的另一端，毫沒危險。其實我們稍用一些頭腦去思考一下，卽不用代用器亦可達此目的。（待續）</p>

<p>這是一只世界上最簡單的長短波交直流廣用收音機。雖然僅僅用着一枚12　A7號複作用眞空管，但是收廣播時成績比普通一管機要好得多，而且還可以收收短波；此外不論交流或直流多可以把朴落揷入使用。12　A7號眞空管實際上等於二只眞空管，因爲12　A7是一只性格與38號汽車眞空管相似的五極管，和一只半波整流管合成的；燈絲雖然合用一根，但是各有各的陰極，而且二者之間有遮物隔開，所以在使用上和二只分開的眞空管無異。這機製造時並無困難，因爲要兼收短波，所以匯該用金屬面板和底板，另件亦應用上等的。綫圈用一又八分之三英寸直徑的揷入式綫圈管，或利用舊眞空管的底座。圈數詳下表。</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥亦以金價為轉移</h3>
<p>粉　昨日粉市、芝加哥洋麥報漲二三角、坎拿大漲四分、當上午開價時、洋麥雖漲、惟以金價開始卽跌、故開市後人心平平、未能挺住、較前日收價、小半分左右、後以金價回升、及現粉依然緊軋、人心復昂、不過雙方觀望居多、交易未暢也、迨至下午開盤、本月份以客戶略有吸進、雖目下未能抽現、將來總須軋貨、遠期亦因廠方未出、浮空略抵、致人心亦見帶上、觀察後步、恐以現貨之緊、尙有續好之勢也、結果本月份好二分二厘半、四五月份漲二分二厘半、六月份漲二分、七月份漲一分七厘半、八月份漲二分云、</p>
<p>麥　昨日期麥市面、因洋麥漲而金價初跌、故賣買雙方同趨觀望、交易甚形淸淡、迨至下午開盤、本月份初仍平平、旋以粉市轉漲、及金價之重升、故買氣稍見暢旺、市價亦見步佳、此種情形、殆全以外櫃爲轉移也、結果本月份漲三分、四月份漲四分、七月份漲四分、八月份漲二分、現麥仍見穩固、以到存不豐、廠胃則尙接續也、開歸德麥三元七角七分、蚌埠麥三元七角半、海州麥三元七角三分、計一千包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （憂患生）</p>
<p>人們站在世界的戰塲上，爭擾不休，認眞非常，結果，同是一樣地死亡，腐臭，何不「知足常樂」啊！</p>
<p>春夜的風雨，把樹枝上的花朶，吹落了不知多少？但，仔細一想，春夜的風雨，也能助樹枝上的花苞，漸漸地開放的，那就沒有悲哀了。</p>

<h3>虎丘的春色</h3>
<p>— 兪友淸</p>
<p>春到了人間，姑蘇城外的虎丘，又擁擠了不少遊人，尤其是星期日，那天上海來的客人，來欣賞虎丘的春色，頻添了不少的足跡。</p>
<p>梅忽然也到蘇州來了，尤其是重大的目的，遊玩虎丘，賞冷香閣的梅花，所以我爲了地主之誼，不得不同他坐了古色古香的馬車，向虎丘路進展。</p>
<p>到了望山橋，走下車來，吐了一口氣，伸了一個懶腰，轉灣走進頭山門，就逢着了村娃，兜賣麥柴扇，也許有些不合時令吧！不過這是虎丘的特產，當然視作例外的事，賣白蘭花的也來了，再有賣陳皮梅而兼作古蹟講解的老者，也向我表示好威。</p>
<p>虎伏閣玩了，御碑亭看看，小吳軒坐了一下，走到五十三參下面，攝了一個影，上冷香閣，喝了幾口茶，倚窗欣賞梅花，不過梅花樹似覺太少了，不再補植，冷香閣上，要無香可得咧！</p>
<p>梅賣了些代代花，玫瑰花，蘇州指南，虎丘小志等，回去預備送給好友，也許自詡是冷香閣上賞梅客，多麼幽雅呀！</p>
<p>春到人間，虎丘的春色，也許不久卽逝，快些來賞玩吧！</p>
<h3>怨偶</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>直等到田先生和汪采姑結了婚三個月，我才知道怎樣的夫妻被稱爲『怨偶』。</p>
<p>『田先生，新嫂子跟你很好吧？』</p>
<p>大家都得這麼帶些調侃的神喜問問的，不論鄰近的大人和孩子，男和女，每見田先生從自已家門裏踱出來的時侯，終是堆上股笑勁兒，向他糾纏着，有好多年輕夥子，還拖住他逼着講閨房中的情調，快活地。</p>
<p>可是田先生沒一次不深皺着眉頭。</p>
<p>『開什麼玩笑來着？這…這，呵，該是我的命運吧？……』似乎遭了寃屈。</p>
<p>這使大家都着了迷陣，爲什麽結婚之後的田先生會變得這樣怨尤呢？從前，他打學校踏進社會，是對於甚麽都抱着樂觀的，命運這東西，他根本鄙棄，現在却不對了，自從汪采姑踏進了他家的門，就完全變了。</p>
<p>『那麼，田先生，莫非你那新嫂子，不合你的…你的…』</p>
<p>這種話該是年紀大些的女太太，半眞半假地向他究問的。</p>
<p>但田先生老是嘆口氣，反背着手，踱出里衖去了，也沒給個回答。同時，大家又看見汪采姑在自來水龍頭邊淌眼淚，有時半夜會獨個兒在被窩裏嗚咽出聲音來。她想到坐花轎，想到拜天地，想到……</p>
<p>『我爲什麽要嫁給一個不愛我的男子？』</p>
<p>最近，田先生把舖蓋移到公司去睡了。</p>
<p>誰都爲這一對怨偶嘆息。</p>

<p>第十回　唐突女郞前露財選色覬覦墻隙裏爲病傷廉</p>
<p>可是月英對於這兩方的話，已經聽得很淸楚，心裏也是盤算得透熟，突然站起來，板着臉道：不，不，那樣做，我不幹。媽，你不要說我們打掉了你的飯碗，我想，就是把我賣了，也要講好價錢，就這樣的糊裏糊塗跟了人，那算怎麼回事。就算今天晚上要了，明天晚上，人家還要不要呢？一個人的身子，不是一斤半斤肉，就是這樣估堆的賣給人。賣，我要一生做一回賣，這樣零賈，你想把我當了什麼人？今天爲了那些洋錢，把我這條身子毀了，以後怎麽樣辦？我要走！說着，轉身就有向外走的意思。就在這時，賈多才由外面搶進屋子來，向他搖着手笑道：不要呌，不要呌！我倒看不出來，這位姑娘，還有這樣一套話。月英紅了臉低了頭，又坐下去，不過是把身子偏側了，向裏面望着。張介夫站起向他拱拱手笑道：我嘴太笨，作媒人不成，拿起斧子來，砍在桂橋上，砍缺了口子，我吿退，我沒有作月老的資格。賈多才也回着禮笑道：這不怪你，祇怪我太糊塗了。我在窗子外面，把姑娘前後幾遍話都聽到了。我想不到這位姑娘倒是這樣一位能說話的人。朱胡氏道：他在家裏的時候，會說話着呢，不過現時出門在外，人生地不熟，他不敢說話了。（一五二）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>到了晚膳的時候，伊便向我們說道：「這是完全不成問題的！因爲皇上回京之後，也沒有什麽重大的事情「要他去處理」。這是一句假話！其實就是說伊自己目前尙無什麽重大的事情要處理。「好在祭奠大廟的日子還在四天之後咧！所以我們儘可安安靜靜的再去休息幾天：明天早上，大家一齊準備着，我們一淸早就要上園子裏去了。」</p>
<p>太后本是習於早起的，而同時還有一層原因，使伊每次從宮中到頤和園去總歡喜在大淸早動身；這原因說破了也是一種迷信。因爲有一天工夫，伊和一位掌理欽天監事務的親王閑談，偶然問起每一天最吉利的時辰多半是在什麽時候？這位王爺的答復是當淸早朝日初升的時候最吉利。於是太后就深信不疑，每次出宮，總堅持着要愈早愈好：無意中倒養成了一種很合衛生的習慣。</p>
<p>第二天淸早，恰巧在那旭日初升的時候，我們這一起的人，連光緒一併在內，便由太后率領着，依舊帶着幾分像昨天那樣的迫促的神情，上轎出宮，魚貫着馳往頤和園去。</p>
<p>一進園子，我們才知道這裏果然是値得我們起一個大淸早的！（二六三）</p>
<h3>唐家墳</h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>奉賢古墓之規模最壯，而復最稱夥頤的，厥唯唐家墳。</p>
<p>據云；唐家墳共有七十二個：顧目今所可得而見者，僅有四五處，其形式居然造得一般無二。墓基佔地甚大，全部用靑石砌成，上覆以土，狀如小山。墳前則華表高聳，翁仲手執朝笏，相向拱立；其他尙有石琢的獅，馬，羊，兎，……都是一對對地排列成行，凡屬封建時代一切足以表現虛榮的點綴，莫不應有盡有！不過它的墓道，現在老早闢做耕田，好多石獸，間有已經翻轉身體，橫臥草中，墳脚也給農夫剝蝕得不像樣子；這未免令人見了，發生今昔盛衰的一種滄桑之感。</p>
<p>前聞人言，此種墳墓，均爲邑中北行鄉唐氏的祖塋，建於明朝中葉。時其祖先某，嘗因擢中巍科，致身通顯，後來爲了貪墨獲譴，遽罹極刑，等到收屍殯殮，首級已失所在；乃連夜雇匠，鎔金爲液，鑄作人頭二置入棺內。又恐葬後被人盜發，因倣古人「疑塚」的先例，同時營成七十二墓，以亂人目。似此傳述，祗好當它齊東野語，姑妄聽之。</p>
<p>考唐氏確係簪纓世族，業已式微。其家中舊有御書樓，用以庋藏宸翰；嗣因不戒於火，化爲灰燼，至今尙留一片瓦爍。足見其在三百年前可以說是富貴兼備，煊赫一時！所以纔能建築這樣幾個矞皇的墳墓。不然，安有如此崇宏的體制，雄厚的物力呢？</p>

<h3>六十年前上海官塲的接印儀節</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>誰都知道，現在行政官的就職，在古時，呌「接印」。可是，當時，這顆印是怎樣去接？現在一般人對於一般官員的就職典禮雖數見不鮮，但要說起從前上海官塲的接印儀節，只怕我們靑年大衆都不十分知道的吧。…………</p>
<p>喝！你在冷笑！你說這是廢話！我可要說你不懂事吶！往常，我們說從前官塲太封建，是不是？你說，他們到底是怎樣封建的，給我聽聽呢？</p>
<p>好，你搖頭，你說這話長得很。這對！我介紹你這個簡單的……。</p>
<p>是光緒三年三月十九日吧，上海那時有位劉道台，名字呌瑞芬的，繼馮焌光以後任職，在這一天的夜裏接印。那「儀節」，你聽着吧！</p>
<p>（一）封印　晚間十點，道縣書役備齊一切儀仗執事，候舊任道臺解印後，即將關防印信兩顆封供彩亭，委上海縣糧廳賚送新任道台住所，即縣東的釐捐總局內。</p>
<p>（二）紫氣東來　隨後，劉道台由該局動身，當然是坐轎子。從東面，往西走，過了縣衙門，還得一直去，轎子要四平八穩。那呌「紫氣東來」。</p>
<p>（三）太平無事　轎子過了三牌坊，就兜走太平街，再往東行，以取太平之義。</p>
<p>（四）兜靑龍到了道台衙門的西轅門口，並不進去，仍就往南，又折北，由東轅門進署，這呌「兜靑龍」。</p>
<p>（五）將軍令　這時夜闌將半，街道肅靜無譁。所有隨從執事，很爲齊整。當時有提標右營防城守兵，以及護軍營的洋槍小隊迎接，用西式大鼓吹奏將軍令，一路按節徐行。威儀很覺凜凜。</p>
<p>那末，進了衙門以後呢，還有儀節，其程序如次：</p>
<p>（一）祭門　（二）謝恩　（三）拜印　（四）公坐</p>
<p>這時，係正十二點。陰陽學禀報子牌時分，文員武弁，兩班伺候；砲聲樂聲，一吹一響；於是，衙門內外，鬧忙非凡，接印儀節完成。</p>
<p>到了次晨，道台就忙着以下各事：</p>
<p>（一）查庫　（二）點卯　（三）謁廟點香　（四）拜會領事　（五）考錄代書　（六）懸牌放吿……你看，這不是和現在大不相同嗎？</p>

<h3>南浦　江灣道上賦春草</h3>
<p>— 錢小山</p>
<p>羣影染萡痕，繞天涯有客關心偏早。輕漾綠波新，東風軟，吹暖荒洲古道。試尋芳，醉眠佳處聞家園如此靑靑，算池塘夢裏，幾回曾到。綠意上征衫，緇塵涴，未負俊遊懷抱。翠烟飄眇。行歌緩踏江南曉。休騐榮枯來日事，一碧無情自好。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談選本</h3>
<p>— 白苧</p>
<p>世界上文學—特別是小說戲劇—的書籍，眞是浩如烟梅，處在忙迫緊張的現世紀，要求遍覽羣籍，眞可說是夢想，因此在什麽槪觀什麽講話之外，應運而生的，便有選本這一類的東西。當然我並沒說古代就沒有選本，不過說這種東西較適合於現世紀的諸條件，而取得牠社會根據上的優越性罷了。單就小說一項而論，我國也曾出現了許多甲選，乙選，自選集，代表作之類的出版物，這却不能一例歸入營利性質上未的。一個精粹的選本，自然可以裁汰蕪雜，歸於醇凈；如其著作是一個作者的菁華，那麼我們也可以說一個選本是這作者全部著作中的菁華了罷？</p>
<p>不過，這披沙檢金的工作也不容易。</p>
<p>過去看到國外出版的作家選集，在汗牛充棟的作品中擇爲一二厚冊，這使得沒時間沒力量或沒機會讀原著全集的讀者，可得到不少方便。卽以法國拉魯斯書店出版的兩果選集而說吧，把他文學生活分爲靑年，壯年，亡命時，老年四個時期，重要作品如孤星淚，九十三年，笑面人之節本（在節略處有旁註），以及重要的散文劇（詩劇在外）短文書札都包括在內，我們雖不能從這裏認識雨果的全面目，或藉此以爲研究雨果的根據，但又可看出個粗枝大葉了，像這樣的選本，我們中國倒也有一些。</p>
<p>可是問題接着就來了，這樣的選擇，是否可靠的呢？選者是只憑着主觀的好惡，還是憑着客觀的評價以定取捨的標準呢？他用的楚什麽的尺度？他是對於原作者有較深邃的研究與較淸晰的認識嗎？在批評精神最活躍的現代，我們對於選書的選者，是也要經過一番選擇的。一個選者須有一個批評家那樣賅博的知識與明銳的鑒別力，這樣他纔能對作品有着客觀上的可靠的衡量，他更須有作家的想像力與鑑賞力，這樣他　可以對作品有着主觀上的玩味。在這裏，我願提起一本爲人們不注意的書來，是馬塞爾，瑪底納所編羅曼羅蘭選集，他本身就是一個作家，對羅蘭的思想與藝術有着獨到的研究，此書開頭有一篇很長的長序，闡明羅蘭的思想，其中則把羅蘭的重要作品如名人傳記，戲劇，名著若望克里士託夫都擇其菁英，依月排歹，每段落前後並附全文綫索及選者詳盡的解說，縱然他那觀點還成着問題，但那審愼的態度是値得取法的。</p>
<p>至於現在從事選擇工作者，似乎還不能以此爲止境，當然更不能臚列篇名截長補短就算了事，而是，進一步去指明那作品之美學的及社會學的價値，揭發其潛伏於作者身後的整個思潮整個流派之終極原因，供給讀者以鑑賞，研究，解釋，批評的方法與資料，使在閱讀之中能與集內作品印證發明，以得到正確的認識。在這嚴密的批評系統之下，一切印象的，主觀的，隨個人好惡以爲轉移的選本將逐漸被捨棄，而成爲無用的東西。那麽像這樣的選擇工作，是亦可稱之爲文學批評文學史工作之一部分的，雖然在表面上看來只是替讀者用了一番裁冗刪蕪的工夫。</p>
<h3>旅人呀，珍重你底年青</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>雨點像無業者的心般地，沉悶而又笨重。</p>
<p>是初春的季節哪，可是，那陰鬱的冷風，仍尖銳得像利刃般刺人。</p>
<p>懷着一顆旅人鄉愁的心情，路着那急劇的步伐，輕輕的消沒在那巨型的陰影下。風，冷嘯着尖利的嚎呌，伴着那沉悶的雨點，跟踪着人們瘦削的背影，亂彈般的橫射過來。</p>
<p>模一摸那灰舊的衣服，已淋濕了；那頂破敗的氈帽也已濕透了，頭上感到到一陣陣的陰冷。</p>
<p>街景慘淡得發腥，低弱的電炬啞了般地，在不斷的抖着輕顫。</p>
<p>「啊！沉睡中的都會，旅人沉　的心哪。」</p>
<p>街。廣漠地像一條沉靜的巨蛇，冷峭的躺着。默對的人行道上似已有遼長的距離哪，我在企圖着以最大的壯氣，從這邊穿過了那邊。</p>
<p>可是，那雨也着實下得太銳　，一顆顆的雨點像燜電般地從天際飛下，在那油亮的柏油道上碰裂着，成爲無數的水珠向四週潑射出去。</p>
<p>我跑着，有着顆壯士的氣豪和英勇；然而，剛到半中又不得不氣頽地退回，這樣我試探着一次二次地，總祗有使我失望和灰心。</p>
<p>「這尖銳的雨，這冷嘯的風啊！」</p>
<p>把算着未完成的旅程：那遼遠的宿地；於是，我開始了着急。</p>
<p>—友人！你們許已舒適地找回你們失掉了心！我們都是在爭鬥綫上的一夥兒，可是誰懂得呢？這兒有個回不得宿地的旅人。</p>
<p>想着，想着，一股感傷像風暴般的掃落了我底心。</p>
<p>好像朦朧在感傷的漩渦里，我想痛快的哭泣着，讓一切憂鬱付與淚珠發洩吧！可是，我沒曾過這麽做。像幽靈般的我反而歇思底里的笑了。</p>
<p>「笑，一個可怕的獰笑哪！」</p>
<p>雨，弛緩多了，風也停止了它的冷嘯啦。</p>
<p>前面，那遼遠的街角，一把溜亮的光波，在低弱的燜耀着，似乎還跟踪着低抑的歌聲，蕩澈這沉悶的空際：</p>
<p>「一盃辛辣的酒液，</p>
<p>一把光芒的長劍，</p>
<p>那兒都曾寄附着昨夕與今朝人們的年青，</p>
<p>旅人呀，旅人！</p>
<p>珍重你寳貴的年靑！」</p>
<p>長望着黝黑的天幕，於是，我繼續那旅途的邁進了。</p>
<h3>雨中的運煤夫</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>豆大的雨點落個不停，不少人和車在路上飛奔。其中獨有一部運煤的榻車，却像牛步一樣徐徐的在雨中前進。</p>
<p>三個彎着腰拉兩個在後推，五個運媒夫的面目全黑得像鬼，「哀賀」的呼聲出自他們的口中，那裏面潛藏着生命的悲哀。</p>
<p>傾盆的大雨向他們身上直淋，藍布大衫被雨淋得緊貼着身，額上的汗珠和雨點同落下地，回去要不生病我再也不信。</p>
<p>有多少人靠了煤氣享福生存，又有多少人爲了運煤在雨中捱命。每個人的身體都是同一的機構，爲什麽生活却有兩樣的不平？</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>在　哖把華情辦完之後，便　　一輛　　　去　崅。</p>
<p>這是一條海濱小道，道途是非常崎嶇的。脚踏車在上面跳躍，應該時時留意着凹入的小洞和雨後脚踏車輾成的溝道，椰叢在身畔忽忽地飛過，草屋子也疏落地在眼角溜過。騎脚踏車在這種道途上行走是非常吃力的，然而一想見將再會見果敢和熱情的郭君，和看見他們幹的事業，心中却很是暢快。</p>
<p>寂寞的大崅市是到了。我在一家店舖前從車子跳下來。</p>
<p>會面的是吳君，而郭君可不曾看見。</p>
<p>大崅市在日中是非常沉寂的。漁人們都對海上去了，處處是魚蝦的臭味在穿入鼻孔的深處，使人欲嘔和使人連連打着噴嚏。蒼蠅隨處在飛着。</p>
<p>「郭君呢？」</p>
<p>「逃到新加坡去了。」吳君在我的耳畔輕輕地說着，同時並用着眼角瞟着坐在櫃檯里的老板。</p>
<p>他把我領到靑年社去。</p>
<p>靑年社的灰黯和悽寂的廳堂使我微微地吃了一驚。這雖然是一間木板和阿答蓋成的簡單的屋子，然而在一年前，這是一羣靑年的集會地，也是漁人們的高尙的會所。在郭君的領導下，靑年們用着蓬勃的生氣和漁人們的生命的活力，在這個寂寞的偏僻的海濱，曾幹起了一番頗爲偉大的事業的。現在呢，廳堂裏寂然無人，而蛛絲把靑年社的牌額染汚起來。</p>
<p>「自從漢務司來這里檢查以後，郭君和我們的事業便碰着惡運了。」吳君開始向我訴說。</p>
<p>「呵！」我把口大大地張開着，一忽兒說不出話來。然後才遲疑地接着說：一你們不是已經逃脫了漢務可的眼睛麽』？</p>
<p>『對啦。我們知道那次漢務司的出巡是很有計劃的，報館的記者被懲戒啦，敎員被停職啦，華人的公共團體被解散啦，……我們一個小小的靑年社，會不被解散麼？我們事先確有一點惴惴着。但是，靑年人是怪有計謀的，我們把三民主義和社會學政治學這一類書籍先給搬走了，把本地方的甲必丹先生請來當「擋箭牌」。由於郭君被審問時應對的得體，和甲必丹老頭兒的庇護，靑年社總算又存在了。」吳君稍稍一息。一陣光榮的紅光微微地在他的臉上浮現着。</p>
<p>這時，海南人的店夥端進二杯熱滾滾的爪哇咖啡來。把咖　汁　　去，吳君的快樂的心情便接着沈下去了。</p>
<p>他接着說，</p>
<p>「　　從　以為滿可以把青年社的事業幹下去了。却不料班哖政府受着漢務司的指示，隨時派暗探來監視我們；而這班捉魚蝦的粗漢子，竟在不景氣下玩起罷工的把戲來。這樣一來，速先前支持靑年社的老板們都咀咒起靑年社來，而郭君便被認爲豐動的角色了。』</p>
<p>他又啜了一口濃烈的咖啡，一支烟在口裏被抽起來。我的心也漸漸激跳起來。</p>
<p>『以後怎樣呢？』我急急地問着。爲郭君搯一把汗。</p>
<p>「我們趕緊從緊張的空氣中找求綏衝的辦法。一方面向漁人們要求慢進，一方而提議於班哖政府，讓我們帮助政府，把從這裏到班哖去的大道，用工程稍稍整理起來，完成一道較爲完好的馬路。」</p>
<p>吳君又把香烟猛烈地抽起來了。我看見他心中包含着一陣猛火。</p>
<p>「這樣，殖民地政府雖然對於我們這班獻　的子民覺到微微的歡悅，而老板們對郭君已視成眼中釘，把靑年社看成　靑年們向老人們搗蛋的機關了。」</p>
<p>『咳！』我不覺嘆惜起來。</p>
<p>吳君把聲音更加放低下去，說：</p>
<p>「郭君因此加上一身債啦！在辦事的店裏虧蝕了二千元。以他在店裏的地位，本來是不在乎的。但是老板們竟藉着這個機會，壓迫我們的老板向政府提出控吿，預備把郭君一下子打入監獄裏去。」</p>
<p>叙述一到緊張的關頭，吳君啜咖啡和抽香烟的姿勢；便越發猛烈了，像要把這整個世界一口呑下一樣。</p>
<p>知道情形不　　　郭　趕速起行。正在夜間，郭君從一只小舢板逃去了地，預備從這裏趁船到峇眼，然後由漁船渡過馬六呷海峽，回轉新加坡去。」</p>
<p>故事是完了，緊張的心情在兩個人的心間漸漸　散下來。此後我不用再聽了；郭君一定由此到新加坡去，現在又做成一個流浪的失業者了！</p>
<p>「可憐他走的時候，」吳君又加着說：「一個銅板都沒有。旅費全是我們凑集起來的。他去後不久，處女式的罷工便失收了。此後靑年社的社員一個個東奔西散，現在是剩個空屋子了。過幾天，屋子主人是要一把牠租給一個馬來人開咖啡店里。」</p>
<p>「呵！」我不能够說出一句話來。</p>
<p>不久我便向吳君吿別。我說我預備到別的地方去了。</p>
<p>從靑年社出來，班年河的河口接着大海正在我的眼前顯現着。潮水打着寂寞的海岸。在大崅的漁人區，疏落四散的屋子正在將近傍晚的天氣里灰黯着。魚蝦的臭味把我的頭腦刺醒起來。</p>
<p>看見漁船是一隻隻陸續地歸來了，漁夫們顯出了工作後的極端疲乏，不禁便在心中暗祝着：</p>
<p>『可憐大　的覇王呵！讓一個時代給你們掙起頭來吧！』</p>
<p>又把而向着東南；</p>
<p>「呵，郭君，祝光明的生活又臨着你吧！」</p>
<p>和吳君握手道別，我又騎着脚踏車回歸班哖去了。</p>
<h3>「海永無波」</h3>
<p>— 李三郞</p>
<p>殘冬的黑夜，南海面刮着那麽狂暴的風，驚心的濤聲沙沙地響個不停的。船進了廣海灣，坐了駁艇在銀白色的浪花面飄到灣上去了。</p>
<p>明天的早晨，太陽含羞似地照着海濱的小都市上的一切，我的朋友便拉着我到山峯上遨遊去了。那高尙的猫形的山峯，矗立在凹形的海灣之邊，巨大的峋嶙的山石，層層疊疊地，那兒有着一塊約摸三丈高的大石，上面刻着「海永無波」四個字，老勁雄壯的。相傳許久以前，有行乞流浪南海的「聖主×」渡廣海灣時差點給巨浪翻覆了。所以，他在山峯上刻下這幾個字，以後，廣海灣外便很少風浪了。這是神話，不過這兒的勝跡也是南海很有名的。</p>
<p>從山峯上望着灣灣的海濱，早上潮退，沙灘伸長到海面一里以外，那時，漁人們一擔一擔地把鮮魚挑上岸來，這兒是南方產魚最富的地方呢。可是，廣海灣上的長街顯得非常頽喪，因爲幾年前有五千山賊盤居在此，弄得全省風雲湧動，調了大軍，飛機，戰艦來圍剿，整整個把月的時光，安靜下來，那戰事的傷創，還深深地在人民的生活里現出來呢。</p>
<h3>嚮晚（十七）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>祗有新文學家，還在洗澡間裏淸淋澎淪地洗着澡。</p>
<p>「我在日本時候，是一天洗二次澡的。」想着：「然而中國人不洗澡。所以中國人是善於保存身上汚垢的，所以大腿非洗得白來不可。惟身上之汚去，則身外之物得保，而歌女亦能叫座而大引起觀衆之贊賞矣！」</p>
<p>這是新文學家想定的最後的結論。</p>
<p>文思一搆成，身體便覺內外舒暢了。再用乾布抹了抹身。新文學家施施然開了洗澡間底門，走了出來。</p>
<p>房間裏却換了一批不同的脚色。全整整齊齊地穿着梭黑色制服。說不定歆生路上爲他驅散馬路巡閱使的秩序維持者也在着呢。</p>
<p>「你是胡一元先生嗎？」那些人中底一個，挺有禮貌地前來招呼。「大漢公司是你開的吧。可是！你却假造水災獎券。咱們已經查有實據了。請你今晚到咱們局裏去一去！」</p>
<p>一個夢，落在郭仁先生身上。眞是有眼不識泰山，述十萬言的新文學家也不認識了呀。然而郭仁先生說不出話來，不特說不出話，運剛才想寫的洗澡救國論也全給忘得一乾二凈了。</p>
<p>郭仁先生給帶了去。在馬路上，昏昏然給夏夜底熱風吹醒過來。郭仁先生記起了胡一元跟他娘舅說的一席隱約的話。於是整個漢口場他眼前：高低不平的三新街？一連幾十家的烟館子，出案的蜂似的馬路巡閱使，拉圾桶邊底遊魂，大漢公司牆上底黑水箍，肚子十分景氣的銀樓老板，女軍長，奧虫階級，文學家底紅底白點子的頭：以至於洗澡間…二十一年大水災興洗驅救國論……</p>
<p>「我在日本的翰　！」萬個子郭仁先生感慨了。（完）</p>

<h3>十萬金的宴會</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>日本貴族院議員大川平三郎，去年六月宿疴之胆石病惡化，一時生命危險，現已全愈，大川為六十餘大公司之主人，昨晚招待朝野名人八百餘人於帝國旅館，舉行宴會，其經費為十萬元，現在不景氣之世界中，大川投十萬金設一夕之宴，可謂宴會之大王也，</p>
<p>日議員大川，設一夕之宴，投金十萬，誠開世界大宴會的最高紀錄，按大川之如是窮奢極侈，其用意不外是因為：去年宿疾復發，陷於九死一生，今幸邀天之佑，得轉危為安，故舉行一大宴會。以表慶祝。此外，大川是一個日本的大富翁，或因去年一病，在神志昏迷之中，悟到世間金錢「生不帶來，死不帶去」的道理，所以今番竟爾一擲十萬金，毫無吝色！</p>
<p>對於大川的豪舉，有人是要代他惋惜，說他不應該揮金若土。其實這大可不必。你只要看他是一位日本六十餘大公司的主人，就可以想像到他是擁有如何豐富的財產！十萬金在大川的眼中，算得什麽？我們平常對於有錢人，常一面痛責其不該盡力剝削，使銅板變成角子，角子變成銀元，造成社會貧富不均的現象，一面又譏罵其不知寶惜金錢，作無度的揮霍。這是何等的矛盾！</p>
<p>老實說，我們要希望社會上沒有不勞而獲的有錢人，不但不須代有錢人作打算，勸他不可浪費金錢，還而更極力獎勵他使用金錢。社會的富人，要是一個個都變成守財奴，視財如命，一個銅子不敢害死，社會的財富，永遠是少數人的私產。我們要希望社會的財富，不集中於幾個富翁的囊巾，正需要有像日本大川這樣揮金如士的奢侈者。例如說，大川若不肯一擲十萬，這十萬金還不是太川的私產嗎？如今他把這鉅量的金錢，消耗出去，社會上便增多十萬金可以流通了。這一來，社會的財富就能向四方八面的發散下去。</p>
<p>可是問題還是有的。獎勵有錢人浪費金錢，雖然很合理，但你能保障有錢人一面揮金如土，一面不會加緊其榨取，以供其慾望的要求嗎？這倒也是很值得顧慮的呵！</p>
<h3>憶番邦</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>紀着年輕的時候，常常聽到年老的祖母背故事似的述說村里人生「番邦」發跡的事，像什麽左鄰右舍那個這個，當初光就是一條赤顆顆的身子離了家，過不了幾年可帶了個皮膚黝黑腦袋後邊結着髮　子，穿了一身怪異的衣服的女人同來，而且一箱箱不知裏　藏着金子還是銀子的皮呷咇，一行列隨着尤耀回來了。</p>
<p>那種女人通常給呌做「番老婆。」—</p>
<p>番老婆都是有錢的，幸運兒才得討個把「番老婆哩，人們都在羨慕地說着</p>
<p>也含着一種讚嘆的老祖爺，靜靜地締聽之後，便不禁及問着：</p>
<p>—爸爸為什麽不去「過番」呢</p>
<p>—爸爸早就去過的，不服水土終於回來了。</p>
<p>背了家背了鄉井去「過番」的人是一天多似一天，尤其是本鄉土弄得沒法站住足的人，更用不着說馬上轉了念頭，一個勁兒巴巴地跑了。雖然要跨越過遼遠的長長的海程，在海程上多方受怎樣的艱辛或險阻，可是誰也沒有半點退怯與畏心，說去便說，乾脆地，果敢地，毫無躊躇。</p>
<p>燃燒在胸中的願望完全埋歿了，現實上所有的担憂和顧慮。</p>
<p>彷彿是去到那兒拾金子一樣，鼓着最大的勁力。</p>
<p>女人們聽着自己的男子要行，會戀惜地阻止道：</p>
<p>——不要去吧，越海越洋多辛苦，總不如自己家鄉平安。</p>
<p>別嚼舌根子，那邊有好日子，難道在這里　着肚子，儘瞧過日是句話麽。去了終會寄錢回家的。</p>
<p>想到好日子，大家一個心！便讓他去了。</p>
<p>那時「番邦」眞許是成了無形中的黃金國土，世間充滿了幸福快樂的天堂，在一般人的腦際上閃爍着赤色的可喜的光彩，確曾給許多人的夢結成了現實的果子，雖說不必凡是去了的個個都會討着「番老婆，」忽然發大財有身份起來，不過至少凖有得一口飯過日，並且可以有些餘欵寄回養家。</p>
<p>「番邦」成為了無路可走的人的最後的活路，同時是掉換生命的顏色的大轉機。</p>
<p>有一個時間，「番邦」便是這樣使人們在心底種植着無邊的美麗的幻想，而又曾是會償過好些人的美麗的幻想。　往後，去的人儘管繼續增加，可是情形逐漸變了。</p>
<p>去的人儘管多着多着，而碰釘子打回頭的却比去的來得越多。不知怎的，才正去不上幾時的人一堆堆轉回來，都垂頭喪氣地，就連力留了十年二十年的幾乎是半輩子的時間的「老番客」，亦有的巴巴地回到完全陌生了的故鄉來了，</p>
<p>怎麼一回事呢？</p>
<p>——唉，市情苦，生意不易做，天天有商店子關門，這世界弄到這般田地，如何了得。</p>
<p>回來的人個個慨嘆地說道，接着，他將會用着愁抑的嘴臉告訴你所欲知道的：什麼商店裁員减薪啦，什麽大好也營業失敗而自殺啦！種種關於那面的一切。</p>
<p>一條是無路可走的最後的活路也給什麽東西塞住了，美麗的夢和美麗的念頭竟眞是成為永遠的夢永遠的幻想吧！</p>

<h3>書香門第</h3>
<p>— 穆</p>
<p>幾次書信磋商，最後一次快信至家中决定出賣那所老屋了，那信里說你曾祖，祖父怎樣地克勤起家，到你父親手里，總算捋下腿肚上的褲脚，博得個讀書人的美名，怎知道到現在要出賣老屋來過日子！</p>
<p>小時候據老祖母說，從前種田人是那樣不値錢，你太太（曾祖），受不住田主的氣，决心要你祖父讀書上進。但是種了人家幾畝田，就不由你有志氣；春耕夏耘，秋收冬藏，那有日子讀什麽書？那時父子倆個拚命的縮衣節食，才能在你父親身上隨了心願。你們出世遲是福氣，能够大搖大擺不被人家罵種田人了！</p>
<p>那時自然是我家的全盛時期。曾祖已過世，他是那樣地含笑咽了最後一口氣的。祖父每天咬着旱烟袋上茶館去，穿起了海靑馬褂，受着許多還沒有把褲脚管捋下的恭維，嫉妬。我這個福氣的子孫，由父親敎讀了幾百個方塊字送進私塾了。</p>
<p>那所老屋就重新修葺起來，門前築起照牆，據說那是顯示讀書人的門第。牆門內掛着一盞終年被風吹動着的大門燈。院落，花廳，大廳，什麼都模仿着蓋造，翻新。廳中央也懸起舉人親筆題寫的崇訓堂橫額。從此我們是書香門第了。</p>
<p>進了兩年私塾，跟着滿淸推翻而進那時所謂洋學堂了，應該被人輕視爲牧牛童子的年齡而被喚做少爺了。在我的記憶中，要稱幸福，就是那時間短短一段時日了。</p>
<p>爬着梯子似的讀完了初小，高小，而進中學，這該是何等光榮底誇耀呵！在我們鄉下，從種田人爬到讀書人，已是名震遐邇，況而進高等洋學堂了這幾乎就是從前的舉人！記得當進因為中學遠在縣里，要去寄宿，在整束了行李的當夜，家中特地烹了幾色豐盛的菜肴，彷彿欵待一個了不起的大人物似的合家寬懷暢飲。席間父親重述了曾祖，祖父的偉大的心願，終於想把更大的收獲放在我的身上；然而這次的歡聚，就結束了我們書香們第的命運了。</p>
<p>軍閥們的野心激起了長時頭的戰爭，這所老屋雖然幸免於難，却變了傷痕纍纍的空屋子；接着父親一病身亡。母親含淚變賣了，田地使我讀到中學畢業。福氣的少爺就那樣負起家庭的重担飄了出來。</p>
<p>這彷彿舉人一樣地位的中學畢業生僅僅做到了養活自己，然而這已是一個幸福的中學畢業生了，許多同等地位的像我們披上長袍馬掛的進候一樣羨慕着我呢！家中母親，弟妹用老方法變賣田地吃飯，曾祖，祖父在地下恐怕亦後悔竭畢生之精力云爬到讀書人的地位，雖然種田人更是一般的貧窮。</p>
<p>延至今日，竟不能保守祖宗傳下來的老星。　到家里最後　　次信，我眼前彷佛浮現出新主人兇很地强逼他們出屋的情形，不禁對信下淚，讀書人的命運呵　後出出　的　運呵！</p>

<h3>關於手頭字的討論</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>的確！這眞一件意想不到的事情呵！那歷來被文人學士看得一文不値，說它是不登大雅之堂的俗體字，於今竟交起紅運來了。自從去年敎育當局給它上了一個「簡筆字」的榮銜，極力提倡以後，現在又有二百多位名人，替它改了一個「手頭字」的美名，列表印書，連動實用了。行見在不久的將來，這種偸工减料的俗體字，竟可以堂而皇之的在文人學士的筆底出現了呵。</p>
<p>究竟手頭字有沒有提倡的價値和必要呢？在下慚愧不是字學專家，不敢輕下斷語，不過我覺得提倡手頭字，卻有一個極重要的先决問題，便是；手頭字普遍實用以後，它的本字，預備怎樣處置呢？是盡行廢除？還是照樣存在？」對於這個問題，有二個答案，第一個當然是「盡行廢除」，第二個當然是「照樣存在」，那末從這二個極端相反的答案看起來，便大可研究一下了。</p>
<p>先拿第一個答案來研究吧！</p>
<p>（一）按我國字典上所有的字，足足有好幾萬，便是我們日常習用的，也有好幾千，可是有手頭字的字，却有限得很，頂多不過幾百個而已。……如所選第一期的手頭字，祗有三百多個，所有常常書寫的，差不多都列入了。……於今將這幾百個手頭字的本字廢除掉，將來小學生寫起這幾百個手頭字來，固然是便當了，但是那筆畫繁多，沒有手頭字的字，還不知有多少，然則又怎樣辦呢？</p>
<p>（二）按我國正體字的結構，可以說是端方平正，一筆不苟，而手頭字却因减省筆畫，結構上便草率得多了，而且有些還弄得像符號又像數碼。如今將這些不倫不類的手頭字，夾在正體字裏面，那末，看起來眞好比東洋文，在許多漢字裏面，夾些東洋字一般，不知道的，還當中國文字，也和日本同化了。</p>
<p>（三）按所選第一期手頭字頭，有好多本身另有音義的，如象，龍，桔，才等，於今將它代表的本字廢除了，那末，這些手頭字本身的音義，和它代表本字的音義，豐不要混面爲　，無從分別了嗎？</p>
<p>再來研究第二個答案吧！</p>
<p>按歷來的俗體字，凡是會寫字的人　都會得為　　得用　從來沒有人專門</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>去學過，於今在正體字外，又舉出這種手頭字來，另印專書。那末，將來小學生進學堂，認起字來，是先認手頭字呢？還是手頭字和本字一起認？如果是先認手頭字，等到年紀大點，再去認本字，這無異一頓飯分作兩頓吃，使小學生多耗費一番認識和記憶的腦力。如果是手頭字和本字一起認，在小學生簡單的腦子裏，看見一個字弄出二樣寫法，一定是纏不淸楚，這樣不但得不到便利，反而多些麻煩。</p>
<p>上面這二個處置本字的答案，在下研究了幾天，竟不能决定應當採取那一個？所以寫出來請提倡手頭字的諸君來研究研究。　劍嘯上</p>
<p>編者按：劍嘯君研究手頭字的熱心，我們非常欽佩。但是他對於「字」的本身的意義，却有點誤解了，所以便想起了許多無關緊要的問題，使他對於手頭字的前途，不能不有所懷疑。</p>
<p>我們知道在這手頭字開始的時候，和劍嘯君抱着同樣疑問的人，一定很多，所以特公開的討論一下。各讀者如有意見，請寫信來參加這個問題的探討。</p>
<p>「文字」不過是言語的符號；也就是紀錄人類思想及各種動態的一種工具，本身並沒有什麼特別意義。我們可以用外國文字把中國古文的意思傳譯出來；同時也可以用中文來紀錄外國的歷史。筆劃繁多的字，和結構簡單的字，同樣是表達意思，實際上毫無分別。劍嘯君似乎很贊成正楷字的端正平方，他說手頭字的結構太草率了，不倫不類，好像一個數號。這就是他誤解文字的意義的地方。因爲文字本來就是一種符號，只要能用和便利，並不一定要怎樣好看，怎樣端正；並且什麽好看不好看，也不過是一種習慣吧了。</p>
<p>我們知道中國的文字在古時是很複雜的，很難寫的。譬如象形字中的「馬」字，就要畫成一個馬形；這豈不是太不便利了嗎？大篆小篆的字體雖然比較有點標準，但是彎彎曲曲的也是非常難寫。由於人們需要簡便的要求，經過長時期的改進，才逐漸的採用了隸書，正楷，草書，行書等類的比較簡便的字體。</p>
<p>我們覺得一件事的成功和變更，總有其長期醞釀的原因。其成功也，多因爲大衆的共同的需要，無形之中，合力創造，累積而成。而在變更的時候，也是出於事勢的要求及時代的潮流，一瀉而下，雖有大力，也不能阻其前進。</p>
<p>像手頭字本是大衆所需要的比較簡便的一種字體，但在過去，由於一般知識份子的傳統觀念，對於這種不登「大雅之堂」的「俗體字」，都沒有加以重視。但是事實上，它寫習的便利和推進大衆文化的關係，却非常之大。譬如正楷的「擔」字，「鬭」字，「灑」字，「喫」字，和手頭字的「担」字，「鬥」字，「洒」字，「吃」字比較起來、同樣是這個意思，寫出來大家也都認識，那末，我們爲什麽不棄繁就簡呢？我們情願多費時間來寫筆劃繁雜的字呢？還是省事的寫手頭字呢？我們可以肯定的說，一般人為了便利一定是寫</p>
<p>因爲事實上的需要，我們可以預測手頭字在不久的將來，一定會通行於全國。你們看：在政府方面，敎育部已聘請文字專家，計劃推行此種字體，將來的課本，無疑的必將手頭字儘量採入。而在人民方面，大多數的文人都在積極提倡，並有「手頭字推行會」的組織。有點列物也已經實行採用手頭字，並且多鑄成鉛字了。</p>
<p>這種熱烈提倡的情緖的表現，更加證明手頭字的價値。劍嘯君問：「手頭字普遍實用以後，它的本字是否盡行廢除？還是照樣存在？」</p>
<p>這是不成問題的，到了手頭字通用以後，本來的字，就漸漸的歸於淘汰，不廢除而自然廢除了。我們翻開一本「康熙字典」，裏面有極多的繁複的古字，但是現在還有人去用它嗎？現在的人都已經改用古字的簡筆字了。因爲要方便啊！像這種手頭字，也就是古字的簡筆字的簡筆字，它的前途當然是暢通的，我們希望將來還有比這種字體更容易習，更容易寫，更容易讀的字體出現！</p>

<p>殊不知道無不常。亦無不中。傅賢之事。自衆人視之。則以爲奇。以爲高。自堯舜視之。則見其常而不見其奇也。見其中而不見其高也。扛萬鈞之鼎。烏獲以爲常。而他人以爲勇。游千仞之淵。沒人以爲常。而他人以爲神。未見堯舜而竊效焉。是懦夫而舉烏獲之鼎。稚子而入沒人之淵也。何往而不敗哉。</p>

<h3>勞勃脫蒙高茂萊十五年刻苦用功的結果</h3>
<p>當你站起來說話的時候，有沒有別的人在笑你？當開著同學會或聯歡會的時候，你有沒有登台演說，博得大家鼓掌的本領？是不是當主席突然說：「現在我們請某某先生，和我們講幾句話」的時候，你會面紅耳赤的？或者平日朋友閒談之中，人家談笑風生，大家都聽的滋滋有味，但是等到你想講話的時候，人家就毫不注意，或者被人家將別的話打斷了，使你不能說完你要說的話？</p>
<p>如果你是這樣一個說話胆怯的人，你不用害怕。你的毛病不是沒有救的。你還可以學到一種技巧，叫人家都喜歡聽你講話。因為許多人和你一樣的，但是他們却將他們的毛病治好了。你亦能治好你的毛病的。那銀幕上你所崇拜的那位風流瀟灑，能言善語的小生，勞勃脫蒙高茂萊，就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>但是蒙高茂萊說：「我下了十五年的苦功，才學到了這講話的技巧，而惟一學講話的方法，就是常常講話」。</p>
<p>銀幕上的勞勃脫蒙高茂萊，你們一定已經看慣了的。他的那種瀟灑自如，談笑風生的態度，使你看了不覺羡慕不置。你很願意你自己亦是那樣一個人，但是你又自以為你所想的，終究是個奢望，因為你覺得蒙高茂萊那種瀟灑自如的態度，是天生的，不是可以學得到的。但是你想差了！</p>
<p>他那種瀟灑自如的態度，並不是天生的，而是十五年來，努力改進自己的成果。當然，你和他當面談話的時候，他的談鋒的佳妙，決不至於叫你失望。你絕不至於發現他是一個言語無味的人。但是，你所不知道的是，他的努力，並不比平常人或你的努力，容易到什麽地方。</p>
<p>「當我在學校裡的時候」，蒙高茂萊說道，「我時時刻刻羡慕一班同學們的善於談話。我總覺得奇怪，他們說著笑著，無論在熟人或生人的面前，心裡一些都不遲疑或害怕。我呢，自己是個天生口笨的人。往往聽到人家言詞的巧妙，記在自己心裡，或是夜裡預備了許多明天要講的妙語。但是等到明天我講話的機會到了，我的舌頭却又倔強起來了。這使我感到一種深切的痛苦。我雖然是個很好的運動家，但是因為我不大講話，人家和我往來的很少，人家講話的時候，我只可以站在旁邊靜聽著。如果你們亦受過這種經騐的話，你亦就明白我常時所感覺的苦楚了」。以上是蒙高茂萊所述的他幼年時代的情形。</p>
<p>「等到離開了學校生活，開始事業的時候，我所須要克勝的困難，並不比別人所有的小到哪裏去，我雖然沒有什麽身體上的缺點，但是我所應當知道的，那時我一切都不知道。我的胆怯，恐怕是我終身無法避免的了。當我起首向紐約戲劇公司尋事做的時候，我或者在招待室裏等候五分鐘，靜候女書記回去報告經理，但是無論如何，我總不肯等候六分鐘的。我等候了五分鐘，就逃走了。戲院的經理先生們，不是說我獨立性過強，就是說我脾氣古怪。他們不知道，我是因為害怕而逃走的。</p>
<p>「到了現在，我非但害怕，並且惶懼起來了。那種滿不在乎，隨處而安的外表，天天從早晨起，像假面具似的戴了起來，但我時時恐懼，倘使一旦戴不上去了，將如之何呢？但是我却天天將那假面具戴上了，如同天天早晨穿衣服一樣。當然，這都是一種防禦工作，恐怕我做一天演員，這種防禦工作一天不可廢棄的。但是如果我能使大眾覺得我是一個舉動安閒，應對如流，言談鋒利的人，我想這是無論誰都能辦得到的，只要他像我這樣下苦工好了」。</p>
<p>由此上蒙高茂萊的談話，所得到的教訓，就是一個人要刻苦用功，克勝自己當前的困難。凡不會說話的人要會說話，祗要自己時常練習說話。勞勃脫蒙高茂萊從來沒有拒絕過導演叫他扮演的角色。他是以無所不能見稱的。但是他在開誠布公的時候，却承認了他並不是萬能的，不過是有隨時學習，自己刻苦的毅力而已。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「風流的母女」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Desirable——國泰</p>
<p>一點也不過分的說，我對這一影片的故事，並不感覺何等重大的興趣。和美國目下所流行的影片一樣，這一作品始終是愛情糾紛的描繪，而且是除了無原則的戀愛糾紛而外，此外似乎沒有什麽可取的東西。</p>
<p>在好些戀愛糾紛的影片中，我們還多少體念到一抹輕淡的人情世味，如金維多的「歸去來兮」，如Jean　Muir以前主演「田野風月」等等，然而在這裏却連這樣的一些也沒有給與我們，這是一部完全以曲折的劇情取勝的戀愛悲喜劇。</p>
<p>也許有人會覺着滿足的，譬如露易絲愛上了高貴的少年羅梭，結果是天真的少女，受不了名門的拘束，如貴婦人討厭她父母的職業之卑賤，，如貴婦禁止她和女僕說話，如貴婦責備她和男人偕游等等，這些都可以引起人們對於虛偽的禮儀厭惡，進而對華貴之家憎恨和鄙視。但是少女到底嫁給了誰呢？她和一個年紀大過她許多的施丹結婚，而且這施丹是她母親有意於他的，於是這母女間的戀愛衝突，便成為這一影片最精彩的地方了！</p>
<p>但是和上次同戲院開映的卡勃拉的「閨女秘史」一樣，這一影片在庸俗的造意之下，却有著極其純熟的表現技巧可看：一方面使我們不能不讚嘆的，便是女主角琴妙Jean　Mutr的演技。她從前在「田野風月」中，是一個年事已長，深懂的人情世故的女人，她勤儉耐勞，她安分於樸實的農村生活。在那裏，由於她演技的成功，使整個的作品為止增光不少。如今在這一影片中，她却是一個年僅十九的少女，這不獨是化裝術的巧妙，更主要的是她將都市少女的天真，非常逼真的表現出來。一點也不誇張的說，她的動作是十分純熟，每一場戲她都有著充分的情感，即使是一個小小的動作，也是沒有不夠或者太過火，完全非常熟練而且沉着的扮演着，真可調爐火純青的恰如其分。如果僅僅是鑒賞演技的話，這一影片是值得人們注意的。</p>
<p>另一方面我們要說的那便是導演乎法了。每一個場面，沒一個鏡頭的角度，每一個畫面的構成，差不多都是無懈可擊，都是十分盡職的。當然，我們也不必誇大的說，這一影片在導演是偉大的成功，因為故事的平庸，好的導演也是沒有方法發揚光大的；那末這裏所做到的也不過是盡職而已，將內容所包含着的表現出來，這至少是我們可以承認的了。但是一部影片決不因技術的成就可以決定它的成功，相反的爛熟的技巧表現了空虛的內容，到底不過是熟練的匠人而已；譬如紙人身上的華麗麗的彩衣，到底不能將紙人變為偉大的英雄啊！</p>
<h3>評「少女的煩悶」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Firebird-大光明映</p>
<p>在許多因內容空虛，演出上不得不流為無謂的穿插，胡鬧的滑稽，甚至無原則地誇張和佈着不夠高明的疑陣的偵探片中，這張「少女的煩悶」，是比較好的了。所可惜的是原作者的本意却不在寫成一齣偵探劇，而在表現一個美貌的少女對束縛她的自由和壓制得她失去了人生意義的舊家庭的反抗，同時又天性的愛着父母的慘劇，這在開始時少女瑪麗對她那種貴族的，陳舊的生活之不感興趣——如在極熱鬧的家庭舞會中，還偷去看伶人等——中間的不顧一切地與戲子白倫來往，致演成殺人慘案後，對父母的自白，以及最後宣稱她希望要過自我的生活，要為自己的生活而生活，這些上是表現得極清楚的。</p>
<p>以一個較有意義的，寫述貴族舊家庭，舊制度壓制下的人倫慘劇的作品，形成僅別於平庸流俗的偵探片型的東西，究竟是怎麼一回事呢？這全在改編者與導演處理的失去重心，再不夠深湛地抒寫少女瑪麗的家庭與內心的生活之後，又放過了她的母親與那伶人白倫的個性的刻劃，只浮光掠影，零亂忽忽地寫了些白倫對玻瑛的追求與後者對他的反應。這兒差不多只見兩人兩條的牽來拉去。致於作為殺案主要關鍵的瑪麗如何被家庭窒息得反動地盲目地去愛白倫，怎樣的傾心於他，可以說全沒有適當的安排。等到案子展開時雖然強調地在呌每個劇中人自己極力的做戲，可是已不能給予人們以強烈的，統一的印象了。更因着中段戲的過於強調在案子偵查的過程中，所以隨著也強弩之末地也減弱了少女要求自由，和自我生活的呼喊這一結束。按製作者所以在瑪麗與白倫的關係上，不多加注意的原意，無非欲顧到偵探片的一般手法，所謂欲擒固縱地待案情大白時，可以使觀眾們恍然領悟。殊不料後面急轉直下中却大有戲在，再也無從如一般偵探片那樣的有充裕的時機來迴照，因此不得不藉對話來作劇情緊張，特別是感情成分極濃厚使觀者無暇回顧中跳滑過去了。至於瑪麗的母親謊認自己是殺人犯這一事，在案情的跌宕上固然大有戲做，但由劇情以及人情上說來，却太過於做作了。從演技方面來看，這兒每個演員都有着可稱的發揮的。范麗悌絲黛爾的母親玻瑛，愛尼泰路伊絲的女兒瑪麗，里昂亞德威的父親與阿勃利司密史的探長，都各有相當的成就，只是演伶人好色之徒的李嘉度考旦，因製作者未能使他發展個性，所以給予人們的印象也就較弱了。</p>
<h3>托爾斯泰不朽作「復活」中雙星簡述</h3>
<p>這是美國大攝製家高爾文氏，發現蘇聯天才安娜史丹以來，第二部文學創作。去年曾經轟動一時的法國大文豪左拉氏傑著「娜娜」一片之主角，現在又擔任了托爾斯泰氏書中的伽陀莎　Katusha。高氏還羅致了茀德立馬區，以充飾那王子迭密德里　Prince　Dmitri。試想有如此千古不朽的言情劇本，加之如此珠聯璧合的天才，又加之以被推為世界八大導演之一的麥穆林氏（R.　　Mamoulian）的非常手腕，當然這「復活」不止是文藝之花的新綻，也是第八藝術的重光。按「復活」在默片時代，是桃樂絲黛里奧所主演的最偉大作品。而聲片時之羅范麗Lupe　Levez的演出，則不見　何成功。所以這是第三次的攝製了。</p>
<p>安娜史丹（Anna　sten)。安娜是蘇俄基夫城人Kiev。她父親會經創辦着跳舞學院，可是安娜在十二歲時，他就撒手長逝了。一家飢寒，所以安娜隨着其他貧苦的兒女們，度着臨時演員的生活。終究天才不能永遠埋沒，她自霍門所著戲劇內，刈取了初次收穫，而被派遣入電影學院研究。終於在一九二八年觀光莫斯科之後，會充飾那世界聞名「黃執照」一片中的配角。後來蘇聯政府派她往柏林工作。她在德國，聲譽鵲起，會和伊密詹寗斯Emile　Jannings合演「慾潮」。Tempet。不久高爾文氏聘她到美國，而成為今日好萊塢一顆紅星了。安娜美麗而健康的身裁，十足代表出東方美。她有金絲般頭髮，棕藍色的眼睛，她平常是不大講話的。</p>
<p>茀德立馬區（Fredrie　　March)。馬區生於八月三十一日，惠士康新之賴森城。當他畢業於惠省大學之後，會服務於該省銀行。可是他的表演天才，替他取到了派拉蒙公司之合同。他在銀幕上歷博勝利，會榮膺第八藝術學院的金牌褒獎。他所主演的名片，計有「化身博士」「天長地久」「愛的測騐」等等。自他屬隸三十世紀公司旗幟之下後，其第一部作品為「雲台春鎖」。米商梅會借他充任「閨怨」中白朗寗。現在高氏亦借他與安娜史丹合演「復活」。馬區是六尺高，一百七十磅鐘。有棕色的頭髮和眼睛。並且還是一位技術精純的網球家。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>威靈登軼事（The　Iron　Duke）（三）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>在巴黎都勒麗皇宮之中，路易王龐然地坐在寶座上，他那透著傻氣的面容上，顯露着惶惑和受了震激的神情。他的四周，站著泰勒蘭，王的兄弟阿道亞公爵，和許多朝廷上的侍臣路易王抗辯着道：「好兄弟，我已經說過，我們這樣大驚小怪，是用不着的」。阿道尔公爵更加着急了起來道：「但是我一定要懇求陛下……你還是聽你軍事顧問的勸告吧」。路易氣鼓鼓的道：「我不怕那高西加的小難種，無恥的殺人犯」。他嘴裡雖這樣說，心裏却未免惴惴不安。他明知自己膽怯，却喜歡裝門面，壮壮自己的膽。</p>
<p>在那羣臣之中，那兒站着一個人，他會率領過拿破崙的勁旅，打過多少勝仗。那人就是南衣大將。路易王望著他道：「南衣大將怎麼不開口？你知道的一定不少。你從前不是和拿破崙一起跟我們對敵的嗎」。南衣大將道：「我勸告你退到琴脫去」。路易聽了，怫然而起，向着一個侍臣道：「去叫我的侄女來。告訴她，我等待她的主意」。</p>
<p>過了一回，安諾勒公爵夫人已經駕到。她身長玉立，姍姍走向路易王的寶座。她臉上露着得意的微笑。當她跪下去吻路易的手的時候，路易說道：「嗄，我親愛的侄女。我先要聽聽你的主意，再定我們的行止。這許多人呌我離開巴黎呢」。</p>
<p>夫人徐徐站了起來，瞪著眼睛向路易四周的人望了一望，然後冷笑了一聲說道：「唔……難道波邦族的人，就這樣輕輕被人家趕走了嗎」？南衣大將道：「他們沒有給人家趕走過嗎」？夫人勃然道：「那是拿破崙邦那巴！却不是一個厄爾巴島上的亡命！」路易道：「這樣說來，你贊成不去的了」。夫人哼了一聲問道：「這個逃走的話，我想一定是從威靈登公爵嘴裏說出來的，是不是」？路易連忙承認道：「是的」。夫人道：「我早已猜到。他是來恫嚇我們的。他拿你扶上了王位，當你是個傀儡。他既痛恨波邦族的人，我們亦痛恨他」！</p>
<p>路易連忙辯白道：「不對，不對。他很尊重我的。他呌我做法國國王，是要我拯救法國的」。夫人聽了，却反唇相稽道：「威靈登自己都想做法國國王。所以你趕快離開那些協約國。你現在可以用不着他們了。難道做了一國的國王，自己沒有臂膀的嗎」？</p>
<p>她那種激烈的言談，使路易王四周的人都站立不安起來。等到她說完了，就回過頭去對着南衣大將。這個時候，南衣大將說道：「你給我四千個精兵，我去將拿破崙生擒過來，放在你的足下」。公爵夫人歎了一口氣道：「感謝蒼天，我們還有這一些勇氣存留着。但是南衣大將又說道：「我做是可以那樣的，但是有一個條件。你們立即離開巴黎」。（未完）</p>

<h3>Foreign Investment Cases in China: US Government's Reply to the British Ambassador - Sympathetic Discussion of Cooperation Possible - French Side Also Expresses Approval - Japan to Hold Conference in April</h3>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of State Phillips declared today that if international assistance to China is necessary, the United States will give sympathetic consideration to this proposal. Phillips continued, stating that he had informed British Ambassador to the United States Sir Ronald Lindsay that the United States welcomes the British proposal and shares the same view as Britain, namely that if China hopes for foreign cooperation, the governments of the countries concerned should be able to provide sympathetic joint assistance. He also felt that for the past several years, this principle of cooperation has long been adhered to by the countries concerned. Currency experts here stated that if China follows the pound sterling or the US dollar with its currency, it is because China wants to curb the rise in silver prices after the United States buys silver on the world market. There is currently a strong movement in China to adopt other currency standards to avoid losses due to silver inflows into the United States. Currency experts further stated that when Professor Kemmerer led an economic survey mission to China several years ago, he suggested that China adopt the gold standard. If China changes its currency system, silver prices may fall, because China will at least use a virtual gold standard as the basis for Sino-foreign trade, and will make the currency value of domestic silver coins higher than the silver content. This move can also avoid the pain felt by bankers in transporting silver to the United States because the silver dollar and its silver content have the same value. Reliable sources from the Treasury Department have learned that officials have expressed sympathy for China's financial situation. Although the United States has not completely abandoned its silver purchase plan, it is willing to cooperate openly with any plan of other countries to assist China. Officials stated that there is no new development in this matter at present, and the first step will be taken by the United Kingdom, which proposed this matter. (National Telegram, 7th) (Paris) Financial circles in France now believe that the French authorities approve of international loans to China, believing that this move is compatible with the policy of stabilizing currencies, but there is currently no definite news on this matter. People in Paris expect that the United States will take this opportunity to compensate China for the losses caused by the US silver purchase policy. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to convene a Commerce Deliberation Council in April to establish the government's policy on Sino-Japanese cooperation. On the evening of the 7th, a committee of government and private sector officials of the Commerce Deliberation Council was held at the Undersecretary's official residence to exchange views. (Associated Press Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today asking Japan to lend China one more pound, which means occupying a greater share of rights in China. If Japan can lend China huge sums of money again without the cooperation of Western powers, Japan's Eastern policy will take another step forward. Of course, the Chinese government is unwilling to accept such conditions and welcomes international loans from banking consortia. Although Japan has not explicitly rejected this method, it has openly expressed its disapproval. Will the Western powers value politics more than profits, or will they allow China to be controlled by Japan? It is still unknown. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakasugi Visits British and American Ambassadors - Discusses Loan Issues to China - British Ambassador Scheduled to Enter Beijing</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakasugi visited British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and American Ambassador Nelson Trusler Johnson yesterday to inquire about their opinions on the issue of international loans to China. The British Ambassador replied during the conversation that joint financial assistance to China from various countries should not be interpreted as an attempt to obstruct Sino-Japanese understanding, and that all relevant parties should participate in the loan. The American Ambassador was reluctant to make a responsible statement. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reports of joint international investment in China and separate loans are quite inconsistent. According to diplomatic sources, although there are proposals for joint investment or separate loans between countries at present, the time of realization is still far away. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the international loan to China, foreign telegrams have frequently reported in recent days, some saying that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Japan and other countries are jointly investing, and others saying that various countries are lending separately, which has aroused widespread attention. The reporter asked a senior official familiar with diplomatic affairs about how things are going and what attitude the various countries have recently negotiated. According to him, the so-called joint investment or separate loans are only proposals between countries at present, and the time of realization is still far away. He also said that as for the British loan to China, judging from Foreign Minister Simon's recent remarks in Congress, it is quite possible to reveal the truth of the matter. (Central News Agency Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the British Ambassador will arrive in Beijing on the evening of the 10th. He will visit President of the Executive Yuan, and after finishing his business in Beijing, he will go to Shanghai. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Counselor Qing Shui of the Japanese Embassy said that Japan's economic cooperation with China is only a preliminary plan, and it is necessary to see how the international situation develops before conducting relevant negotiations with the Chinese side. Minister Arima is scheduled to be recalled to Japan next month, and has no intention of coming to the north before leaving China. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources at the British Embassy, the British government has no other opinions on the international loan to China, except for the declaration issued by the embassy in China on the 6th, which stated everything. British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is indeed planning to go south recently, but the date of departure has not been decided. (Central News Agency Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is scheduled to enter Beijing next Monday with Chinese Counselor Deschamps and Third Secretary Garcia, and will stay for about a month. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Banks to Continue Transporting Silver to Shanghai - Value of 700,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Silver worth 700,000 yuan is scheduled to be transported to Shanghai next week, probably on the Dollar Line ship President Wilson. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes Special District and Office in Eastern Chahar - Song Zheyuan to Conduct Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Japan established the Special District Commissioner's Office in Eastern Chahar and appointed Li Shouxin as the commissioner, it arbitrarily劃divided the Erhuna Han Wuzhumu Xin and other banners in northern Chahar into the special district. The organization of its commissioner's office is divided into three departments: Staff, Guidance, and Administration. Li also organized two detachments of the Eastern Chahar Garrison Army, recruiting refugees and actively engaging in activities. Song Zheyuan is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital on the 10th and will return to Chahar to conduct negotiations on the above-mentioned incidents. It is reported that the pseudo-Garrison Department of Dolon has four divisions under it: Staff, Adjutant, Military Supply, and Military Law, governing two detachments, each detachment consisting of two regiments of cavalry and one regiment of infantry, and a guard regiment. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Pseudo Garrison Headquarters in Dolon governs two detachments: the first detachment leader is Liu Jiguang, and the second detachment leader is Yin Baoshan. The pseudo army has more than 4,000 people and is actively training, ready to be the vanguard in a plot against Inner Mongolia. Japan is increasingly eager to seize the Mongolian salt ponds. Recently, Otsuka Sanjiro, the director of the pseudo-Chengde Salt Affairs Office, strictly ordered salt fields and salt merchants to register and pay taxes at the Dolon Salt Affairs Office, otherwise they would be confiscated. Salt merchants are in great panic. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Police Captain Goes to Yutian to Supervise the Change of Guard of the Security Forces - Special Martial Law Implemented in Tangshan - Sun and Liu's Troops Request Reorganization First - New Security Forces Stand By, Deployment Locations Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Captain Zou Ze of the Tangshan Japanese Military Police, accompanied by a number of military police, went to Yutian on the 7th to supervise the change of guard of the security forces. On the evening of the 7th, Yin Rugeng did not go to Yutian because he was waiting for Feng Shoupeng to finish his treatment. Feng's troops set off for Tangshan by truck this morning, with a total of 602 artillery, infantry, and cavalry, exceeding the reported number of 450.

<h3>The Impact of the British Defence White Paper</h3>
<p>— Micro</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon's trip to Berlin was set, and the German government was preparing a grand welcome, planning to use President Hindenburg's former residence to accommodate him. However, on the eve of his departure, Hitler suddenly cited "catching a cold and losing his voice" and asked Simon to postpone his visit to Germany. This led newspapers in various countries to speculate that Hitler's illness was merely a diplomatic excuse, and the real reason was the British government's publication of the Defence White Paper signed by Prime Minister MacDonald, which included phrases such as "German rearmament," thereby arousing Germany's reaction. However, investigating the facts, is the key to this really the publication of the White Paper? Is there still hope for contact between Britain and Germany? This is a matter of great importance.</p>
<p>The publication of the British White Paper was not only seen by German public opinion as an "unfriendly act," but even British Labour Party members criticized the government with mocking words, and it is rumored that they will propose a vote of no confidence in the government during the defence debate in the House of Commons. We do not need to definitively say that the postponement of British-German talks is due to the publication of the White Paper, but the publication of the White Paper does reveal the alienation of feelings between countries and the difficulty in resolving international disputes. Britain has always called for striving for international peace, and Simon's recent desire to go to Germany was originally to complete his Anglo-French London Agreement plan for this year. However, looking at the published White Paper, both military spending and personnel have increased, and it states, "The disarmament conference has now stalled, Germany has rearmed, and Russia, Japan, and the United States have also increased their armaments, so Britain cannot ignore this." It also states, "The British government believes that the current period is one in which military preparations cannot lag behind," and so on. Therefore, what Britain is attempting is definitely not the so-called world peace, but how to unite European countries to deal with other countries in Europe or outside of Europe. The so-called Anglo-French Agreement and the so-called Central and Eastern European Pacts are all just manifestations of this policy. In seeking the unification of Europe, Britain cannot but take Germany into consideration in addition to France. There are considerable differences of opinion between Britain and France on the German question, and it is also difficult for France and Italy to be completely harmonious. Following the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement, the London Anglo-French Agreement is still a good piece of work. On the one hand, it uses the joint union of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium to ensure the security that France has been longing for, and on the other hand, it allows Germany to reorganize its military, so that the military equality that Germany demands can also be realized. At the same time, there are Central and Eastern European Pacts between France, Germany, France and Italy to unite them. If the unification of Europe can come to a stage because of this, then Britain can devote itself to the Far East issue. This is what the British government hopes for.</p>
<p>However, from the German perspective, rearmament is indeed what it desires. The Central European Pact is intended to prevent the merger of Germany and Austria, which Germany is reserving. The Eastern European Pact wants to maintain the status quo of Germany's eastern border, which it firmly rejects. This attitude can be seen from Germany's reply and the tone of various German newspapers. However, France believes that the various clauses of the London Agreement are complete and inseparable, and Germany's rejection of the Eastern European Pact is also deeply resented by the Soviet Union and Poland. Therefore, Germany's attitude puts the London Agreement at risk of failure. As a result, British Foreign Secretary Simon had to personally come forward to prepare to travel from Paris to Berlin, and from Berlin to Moscow and Warsaw again, to seek further factual discussions. Originally, all countries had high expectations for this trip by the British Foreign Secretary, believing that after this British-German meeting, the structure of the London Agreement could be established. Unexpectedly, on the eve of his departure, he was blocked by Hitler. It is no wonder that newspapers in various countries have speculated and made various accusations against Germany. However, we believe that the postponement of the meeting may be due to Germany's attitude not yet being decided, or even if it has been decided, there is a need for repeated consideration. Therefore, Germany had no choice but to take this back-and-forth move. Although the publication of the White Paper is enough to arouse Germany's resentment, it is not the only reason for the postponement of British-German meetings. It is expected that such meetings will continue to be held soon, but it is difficult to say whether the results will be as expected by Britain.</p>

<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Eden Speaks Defending the Defence White Paper British Foreign Policy Still Based on the League of Nations Soviet Russia and Poland Formally Invite British Cabinet Members to Visit</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden delivered a speech in Swindon today, defending the government's Defence White Paper, stating that the British government's foreign policy is still based on the League of Nations, and regards it as the most effective organ for implementing this system. The moderate defence strategy opened in the White Paper does not violate this policy. The British government is willing to continue to operate to increase the authority of the League of Nations, but the British government cannot but admit that not all countries have the same purpose. The fact today is that the collective peace system is now in a state of evolution. Unless all countries have the willingness to cooperate in operating this system, the governments that believe in this system have an obligation to take the most important precautions for other countries and for their own people. The British government is now trying to achieve a solution, and the three things that have indeed increased in Europe in recent years, disturbance, panic, suspicion, and ambition, are now making the European political horizon dark. This is what the British people are most concerned about. The development of science has changed Britain's isolated position. Although the political outlook of the British people has not undergone any similar changes, Britain's feeling of shadow and influence on all European affairs is now more direct than before. The comparative separation spirit preserved by Britain's isolated era in the past made it easier for Britain to contribute to peace. This is beneficial to Britain itself and to any country in Europe. The British government is deeply worried about the increase in armaments in many countries in Europe and other places, and Britain's military equipment has decreased compared to after the war or before the war. For example, the tonnage of the British Navy was 2.16 million tons in 1914, and now it is 1.18 million tons. The naval officers and soldiers have been reduced from 152,000 to 92,338. At the end of the European War, the British Air Force was the world's champion, and now it has fallen to fifth place among the air force countries. As for the British Army, it is only slightly better than the guard. Eden said at the end that the funds needed for the current proposal are due to the initial defence plan, which was previously postponed in the hope that international compromise would eventually succeed and make this move unnecessary. If the international situation has changed, this defence plan can also be modified. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The date of British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany has been postponed due to the ill health of German leader Hitler. However, the British government has received formal invitations from Soviet Russia and Poland, inviting British cabinet members to visit Moscow and Warsaw. The British Foreign Secretary stated in the House of Commons that the government gladly accepts this invitation, and Lord Privy Seal Eden will travel to Russia and Poland. A member asked whether the trip to Moscow was before or after the trip to Germany. Simon replied that this matter is not forced. According to the arrangements that have already been agreed upon, the trip to Russia and Poland should be after the trip to Germany, and he hopes that this procedure will not change. At the same time, those who support the government have proposed an amendment to the motion of impeachment against the government that the Labour Party will move during the defence debate on Monday, which reads: This House respects the country's responsibility as a member of the League of Nations, and hopes to seek the limitation of armaments through international agreement, so it recognizes that unilateral disarmament cannot achieve this goal, and supports the government's policy, believing that this is necessary for the people's security and the implementation of international obligations. This amendment will be proposed by former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is now heard that Hitler's representative on disarmament issues, Ribbentrop, will go to London in the near future to have contact with the British authorities. According to the recent German government's request to Foreign Secretary Simon to postpone his trip to Germany, it caused a bad impression on the British side. Generally speaking, the German authorities hope that after Hitler's confidant (referring to Ribbentrop) goes to Britain, all the clouds will be scattered. In addition, the German side seems to hope that the date of Foreign Secretary Simon's visit will not be too delayed. If Hitler's health has not recovered when Eden travels to the capitals of Russia and Poland via Berlin, Germany will deeply regret it. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Turkey Concentrates Large Army on Border Balkan Situation Becomes Tense Again Greek Civil Strife Still Severe League of Nations Considers It Serious</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The world is seeing war clouds looming again today. Those who are committed to the peace movement must redouble their efforts to seek peace. It is reported that Turkey has concentrated five divisions on the Bulgarian border, supported by 500 cannons. It is said that Bulgaria is also concentrating troops on the Greek border, while the Greek civil strife is severe. Government warships are still bombarding rebel bases on Crete. French warships have been ordered to sail to Greece to protect overseas Chinese. The borders of Abyssinia in Africa and Italian Somaliland have long been gathering large armies, and the war in the Gran Chaco of South America has not stopped so far. Even Paraguay's withdrawal from the League of Nations is not reluctant. In recent days, Cuba has been plagued by riots, with many deaths. Banditry is also rampant along the coast of Central America. The League of Nations authorities believe that the Turkish-Bulgarian dispute has become a serious situation, and some aspects even believe that it has a direct relationship with the Greek revolution. Italy is actively preparing for war and can launch it at any time. In the Balkans, it can be regarded as Bulgaria's protector. If there is an explosion in the "powder keg of Europe," Italy will inevitably be affected. If so, countries around the world will abandon their peace theories and resort to war. Turkey does not deny its accusations against Bulgaria, which the League of Nations considers very serious, and Bulgaria's notification does not cite the League of Nations Charter and demand a solution, but only explains the facts. The notification was submitted by Bulgarian representative Antonov to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. Antonov said that he is willing to represent Bulgaria and resolve the Turkish-Bulgarian dispute without the use of force within the possible scope, but the notification still formally accuses Turkey of pressing the border with heavy troops. It is understood that direct negotiations between the two countries' officials have failed. Turkish representative Hüsnu issued a statement saying that Turkey is only taking precautions because Bulgaria is concentrating troops on the Greek border. At the same time, the Greek government announced that the rebellion has been suppressed. Although it still occupies Crete and other unconnected locations, it will soon be eliminated. According to unconfirmed news from Athens, former Greek dictatorial military officer General Plastiras is now near the border, waiting for an opportunity to move. However, official circles do not believe it. The Greek government is also imitating the methods used by the United States during the European War, using airplanes to distribute leaflets to the soldiers in rebel positions, warning the fighting soldiers that they are being forced by their superiors to rebel. If they agree to mutiny, the government will not pursue them and will protect them. In fact, the League of Nations authorities are inevitably overthinking, because major countries are participating in these disturbances, but a single spark can start a prairie fire. Once there is a conflict, it is unknown how it will end, which is worrying. (8th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Greek War Intense Government Forces Fail to Attack Rebel Army Wins Repeatedly at Night</h3>
<p>Athens The Greek government's attempt to suppress the rebels has now failed. Although various new weapons are used to suppress the insurgents, the turmoil is still very fierce. At night, the rebels won repeated victories and have occupied the islands of Chios and Samos. The government fears that the rebels will use the warships they previously seized, so it ordered all coastal lighthouses to be extinguished. At the same time, anyone who wants to enter or leave Greece must first obtain an exit permit from the Ministry of the Interior, because the authorities do not want people to leave the country to participate in the rebellion. It is heard that Turkey and Bulgaria have strengthened their border defenses to prevent rebels from escaping into their territory. Anyone who crosses the border with weapons will be arrested and disarmed. The sound of cannons has been rumbling continuously in the Struma River basin for the past 24 hours. The government forces attacking the rebels in Eastern Macedonia are now using heavy artillery to bombard the enemy's position, and government planes are also dropping bombs from the sky. The rebels are retaliating with anti-aircraft guns. At the same time, the artillery team is also attacking the government's enemy. The Imperial Airways gunboat Imperial, with the permission of Venizelos, sailed out of Crete and has now arrived in Alexandria, and the exact news from Crete has begun to spread. According to the captain of the gunboat, the people of the whole island support Venizelos and are confident of victory. If he cannot succeed on the mainland, Venizelos will declare the 3,300-square-mile island of Crete an independent country and appeal to the League of Nations for assistance. A Greek government plane dropped bombs on the enemy's patrol ship Averoff, killing two sailors. The ship then fired anti-aircraft guns, shooting down two government planes, which sank into the sea. The situation is extremely serious. The government still believes that the rebels will be defeated soon, but according to the opinions of neutral observers, the situation has the possibility of being very dangerous. Twenty government planes bombarded the Kavala port in the Aegean Sea yesterday and strafed the coast with machine guns. The European powers are closely watching the progress of the Greek rebellion. In view of the serious situation, the British government has sent the warship "Sovereign" to Faleron Bay outside Athens. The French patrol ship Verdun arrived at the port of Athens today, and there are still two patrol ships on the way. According to news from official circles in Rome, the Italian government is now studying ways to protect the interests of Italian overseas Chinese in Greece. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Finance Minister Advocates Convening International Monetary Conference Roosevelt Pays Attention to the Decline of the Pound</h3>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Martin asked the House of Representatives today to convene an international monetary conference as soon as possible to consider the rise and fall of currencies and end the international monetary war. Martin said that this conference should be committed to the stability of various currencies, and countries should conclude agreements to adjust various currencies on the basis of fair competition. This move will avoid currency contraction and inflation plans that threaten world commerce. It is understood that the French cabinet is also considering various aspects of international finance, because it may affect the French gold standard. At the same time, news came from Beijing that Prime Minister Tunis declared to the House of Representatives that he had asked the French government to participate in a gold group meeting to review the current world currency issues. However, the Prime Minister solemnly declared that he supports the absolute parity of French and Belgian currencies and asked the House of Representatives to vote on this matter. Belgium declared a few days ago that Belgium has not seen any reason to change the gold standard, because various exports have increased, and the country does not need to implement currency devaluation to suppress living expenses.

<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain reiterated his views on the gold standard in the House of Commons today, saying that Britain does not need to feel any moment of unease regarding currency issues. Someone in the House of Commons inquired about the current and future trends of the country. Chamberlain replied that the major powers of the United States and France have a large amount of gold reserves and manipulate the world's gold market. Before the two countries develop economic relations, Britain does not want to restore the gold standard. Chamberlain believes that the recent decline in the pound is due to newspaper speculation about changes in the cabinet and changes in national financial policy. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Belgian Prime Minister declared in the House of Representatives today that the Belgian government has proposed to convene a conference of European gold standard countries immediately to discuss the exchange situation caused by the recent decline in the pound. This proposal has been gladly accepted by the French Finance Minister, who said that the entire French government is willing to support the Belgian government's plan. The Belgian Prime Minister also emphasized that the countries concerned should not abandon the gold standard. As for Belgium, it will never reduce the value of the Belgian Franc. Whether this request to convene a conference has been issued has not been mentioned. Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are now major gold standard countries. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The United States suspects that Britain is manipulating the exchange market and starting a monetary war in order to stabilize the currency value in the future based on the gold standard. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain therefore made a sincere statement to dispel his doubts, stating that Britain has not done this. The Chancellor stated that the equalization fund has never been used to deliberately raise or lower the price of the pound. As for how the equalization fund has been used recently, the Chancellor is unwilling to explain, because once it is announced, it will destroy the value of the equalization fund's operation. The Chancellor also said that the position of the pound is absolutely not something that should make Britain feel a little worried, because the purchasing power of the pound in the country is the same as three years ago. He has not changed his opinion that gold is the best international monetary standard, but it is impossible to restore the gold standard under the current circumstances. Unless the general situation is indeed satisfactory and the gold standard can be restored without being abandoned again, we cannot find a way to do it suddenly. The pound in the foreign exchange market was fluctuating again today. After the White House issued an article denying that President Roosevelt intended to continue reducing the gold value of the dollar, the pound was quite weak, but the US equalization fund sold dollars, and the British exchange rate rebounded slightly. As for the British equalization fund, it has not been used yet. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Those responsible in Washington are now quite suspicious that Britain is deliberately lowering the pound's price, wanting to force the United States to stabilize the dollar's price. It is heard that someone close to the White House has an impression that, according to President Roosevelt's opinion, the reason why the British government is lowering the pound's price is based on a theory that the United States now needs to maintain central credit and the people's trust in the recovery process, so it cannot further reduce the dollar's gold value to retaliate against Britain's move to lower the pound's price. What is known to all is that President Roosevelt is now carefully watching the decline of the pound and considering with his advisors the impact of the pound's decline on the American economy. However, President Roosevelt is completely standing on the viewpoint of calculating the value of the dollar with American goods to watch this problem. As for how to manipulate the exchange rate, it is not what President Roosevelt is paying attention to. President Roosevelt seems to have decided that he does not want to make a plan to fix the dollar until the price level of 1926 has indeed recovered. According to the current price index, it is about 80% of the 1926 figure. Everyone feels that the trend of price increases after this will be slower than before. President Roosevelt's remarks yesterday still aroused various speculations from those concerned, believing that the situation is still chaotic. Although the White House denied that President Roosevelt had indicated yesterday that he intended to further reduce the dollar's gold value, President Roosevelt did not clearly and unequivocally deny that he intended to lower the dollar's price, but just smiled it off. In fact, the pound's decline is so drastic, and the United States' response is not yet determined, so President Roosevelt is indeed unable to easily make a guarantee not to lower the dollar's price again at this time.

<h3>Cuban Labor Unrest Spreads</h3>

A French warship patrolling the Mediterranean has been ordered to go to Piraeus to protect foreigners outside the war zone. (8th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S. Expands Army, Adding Over 46,000 Regular Troops</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today was filled with a military atmosphere, having passed a bill to increase the regular army by over 46,000 troops. The United States' original military strength was 118,750, now to be increased to 165,000. However, compared to other world powers, excluding Germany, which is restricted by treaty to only 100,000, there is still a significant difference. The debate on this bill was very heated. Democratic Senator Lewis stated that without a strong army, the United States would not be able to resist a joint attack by the Russian army and the Japanese navy. Currently, major powers have no particular goodwill towards the U.S., so a joint effort against the U.S. is entirely possible in case of disputes. Democratic Senator King attempted to calm this sentiment, stating that the request to increase military strength was merely the result of the activities of a few military personnel. In reality, Japan does not want to fight the U.S., but only wants to consolidate its position in Manchuria. At this point, Democratic Senator Long questioned King, who could only answer that Japan had not complied with the Four-Power Treaty, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Covenant of the League of Nations. The bill was then put to a vote and passed with 56 votes to 26. During further debate, Democratic Senator Duffy stated explicitly that Japan had intentions towards the U.S. coast. Progressive Republican Senator Borah responded that while Japan certainly wanted to expand its territory in the Far East, what pretext would it have to contend with the U.S.? If Japan truly intended to improve relations, would the U.S. increasing its army by over 46,000 troops be enough? Some people say that the U.S. and Britain may not remain friendly forever. Borah responded that if the British Empire were to go to war with the U.S., it would collapse overnight, as Britain's most powerful territories would not back the mother country in the event of conflict. International observers here do not pay much attention to the U.S.'s increase in the army this time because the number is small. The result of the increase is only equivalent to the army of Czechoslovakia, and slightly more than that of Yugoslavia. Approximately, the standing armies of various countries around the world are as follows:</p>
<p>Russia 8,830,000</p>
<p>France 584,000</p>
<p>Italy 437,368</p>
<p>Britain 396,259</p>
<p>Japan 225,000</p>
<p>Poland 325,456</p>
<p>Romania 295,827</p>
<p>Spain 203,000</p>
<p>United States 165,000</p>
<p>The above table only lists standing armies; the millions of reserves are not included. The number of U.S. reserve forces lags far behind other countries. One of the most important points in today's Senate debate was the reaction of various countries to the remarks made by some senators. It is also worth noting that before the Senate passed this bill, it issued a statement saying that the U.S. had started building 75 warships and planned to build another 24 next year. However, it is claimed that even if the entire naval construction plan is completed, the actual strength of the U.S. would still be 78 warships short of what is permitted by treaties.

<h3>Issue of the Japanese Emperor's Authority: Dr. Minobe's Theory Rebutted by Kikuchi in the House of Peers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) During the House of Peers session on the 8th, Baron Takeo Kikuchi vehemently rebutted Dr. Tatsukichi Minobe's theory of the Emperor as an organ of the state. The situation of his criticisms is as follows: (1) Disregarding the national polity; (2) Forcibly pulling the Emperor into the scope of constitutional provisions; (3) Placing imperial edicts in the position of ordinary documents. He refuted the theory based on the above arguments, completely demolishing it. Next, he requested the opening of a closed session to seriously discuss the measures. Therefore, the issue of the Emperor as an organ of the state seems to have become the central issue of the parliament. The House of Peers session continued to open the closed session at 1:40 PM, and continued to hold the regular session at 2:08 PM. First, Baron Kikuchi continued his questioning, to which the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Army, the Minister of the Navy, and the Minister of Education responded. The situation is as follows: Kikuchi asked whether clarifying the national polity should be the responsibility of those who bear the responsibility of assisting. The Prime Minister replied that he also felt the same way about cultivating the Japanese spirit and the concept of the national polity. He did not agree with Dr. Minobe's theory of the organ, but how to deal with the theory should be carefully considered. Navy Minister Osumi replied that as a military man, he was not pursuing legal countermeasures. The Japanese national polity is as brilliant as the sun and moon, unparalleled. The loyalty of soldiers should be encouraged by this, so those who violate this belief should not be accepted. Army Minister Hayashi replied that although the army did not think it was ideologically influenced, he believed that the doctor's theory could not be accommodated in the belief of the national polity. Baron Kiyozumi Inoue also raised questions about the issue of supreme command in relation to Dr. Minobe's theory of the Emperor as an organ of the state. Army Minister Hayashi replied that the supreme command is solely entrusted to the Emperor, and the Imperial Army is dispatched accordingly. Education Minister Matsuda replied that he could not agree with the organ theory regarding the supreme power of national governance. As for the guidance of students, cultivating the Japanese spirit is the right thing to do, so as not to touch upon this kind of thinking, etc. (Japan United Press Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Five Mutinous Warships Missing</h3>
<p>Athens: Five mutinous warships left Crete three days ago, but their whereabouts are still unknown. The government is very worried that the mutinous warships will suddenly appear in Macedonia or Piraeus and bombard the shore. This morning, a destroyer suddenly appeared at sea in the thick fog and bombarded the port of Thessaloniki, which caused considerable anxiety in the capital. Fortunately, the fog was heavy today, and it was impossible to aim, so there was not much damage in the port. The ship left after bombing for some time. The Swiss government has buried mines around the Strait of Salamis for defensive purposes to prevent the other four mutinous warships from sailing into the Port of Piraeus. The ports of other places, such as Thessaloniki, are also surrounded by mines. Government warships have also been ordered to step up patrols. Furthermore, the rebel party won a small victory today. They have occupied the island of Lesbos. (National News Agency Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Warships Continue to Sail to Greece</h3>
<p>Athens: The French destroyer "Verdun" has arrived in Piraeus, joining the French cruisers "Foch" and "Tourville," which were already in the port, to jointly protect the lives and property of French nationals in Greece. Today, the Greek Council of State promoted Army Minister Kondylis to Lieutenant General. Also today, the British Ambassador to Greece visited Prime Minister Tsaldaris and expressed great sympathy for the Greek government's efforts to maintain public order, and sincerely hoped that the government could restore the situation as soon as possible with the minimum amount of bloodshed. Yesterday, Prime Minister Tsaldaris issued a statement to the Havas News Agency, clarifying that the republican system would not be threatened. It is ridiculous that rebel leader Venizelos claims to protect the republican system and rebels. Today, the Athens News Agency reaffirmed the Prime Minister's statement, saying that there is absolutely no propaganda for restoration in Greek political circles, and such propaganda cannot be carried out. The current government is determined to consolidate the republican system from beginning to end. All actions of the Tsaldaris cabinet are in compliance with the constitution, and it can be called a true republican system that has never existed before. Although Greek citizens are subject to legal restrictions, they are free to express their opinions, but no one is attacking the republican system. Venizelos's rebellion under the pretext of protecting the republic not only fails to win people's trust, but also proves that his rebellious actions are entirely out of personal ambition, because Venizelos's background and his consistent attitude are opposed to the republican system. At present, the actions of Venizelos and his followers are contrary to the republican system and the freedom of the people. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Expresses Personal Apology</h3>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Greece, Waterlow, expressed "personal apologies" to Prime Minister Tsaldaris for the tragic bloodshed caused by the Greek affairs. As for the cause of the Greek civil strife, Waterlow did not express any opinion. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Bulgarian Representative States to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Greece is now in revolution, and there is a new threat to Balkan peace. This is what the Bulgarian representative said to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol today about the Turkish military activities. The representative also opposed Turkey's deployment of large forces along the Bulgarian border, saying that if it is not stopped soon, Bulgaria will have to appeal to the League of Nations. The Bulgarian representative also stated that his mention of this matter was only to seek a friendly solution to the entire case. The Turkish Ambassador to Switzerland responded to the Bulgarian representative's statement, saying that Bulgaria opposed Turkey's military plans, which were taken to protect the Dardanelles. The ambassador visited Avenol today, stating that Bulgaria is also taking military plans along the Greek border. The ambassador did not dismiss the view that Turkey had a will to fight, saying that the Balkan Pact was sufficient to guarantee the current situation. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Statement from Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Paris Midi newspaper published a speech by the King of Abyssinia, repeatedly stating Abyssinia's position and attitude in its dispute with Italy. In this speech, the King reaffirmed that Abyssinia seeks only peace. The Abyssinian government does not refuse to compensate for losses if such losses are reasonable. However, in seeking a peaceful resolution, Abyssinia cannot silently allow others to place the responsibility for the Ual Ual massacre on them. Before exhausting all methods to achieve a peaceful resolution of various issues, Abyssinia will not allow others to invade its southeastern border. The King further stated that Italy's rash actions were due to inaccurate reports. Abyssinia, in view of Italy's persistent attitude, had no choice but to petition the League of Nations. However, Abyssinia has never mobilized its troops. The King continued to declare, "Abyssinia seeks only one thing: to maintain its existing territory and to restore its original territory that has been gradually swallowed up by its powerful neighbors. According to treaties, this territory originally belonged to Abyssinia, so it should be returned to Abyssinia. Abyssinia will do its best to achieve its goals through peaceful means. What we want is that a just third party can come forward and make the true state of affairs known to the world. Abyssinia is willing to accept the decision of this third party, and even in the event of great disappointment, if it is determined that Italy's reasons are sufficient, Abyssinia will faithfully and sincerely fulfill them."

<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Xinjiang's Political System and Finance</p>
<p>Due to its unique historical and geographical situation, as well as the lack of vision and decisiveness of past administrators, Xinjiang's political achievements and progress have historically been lower than those of other provinces. After the "April 12th Incident" in 1933, the new provincial government's administrative system, in addition to reorganizing the original four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, also added a Department of Agriculture and Mining. The initial chairman was Liu Wenlong. However, after only half a year, due to the failure of various generals' plans to support Liu, Liu was forced to step down. Zhu Ruichi was then appointed as the acting chairman. Upon Zhu's death on March 25 of the following year (1934), Li Rong succeeded him. Subsequently, on August 17, Hojanias was welcomed to the province from southern Xinjiang and appointed as vice chairman. Following this, each of the departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, Construction, and Agriculture and Mining added one or two deputy department heads to accommodate influential figures from the local Turkic, Dungan, and other ethnic groups. Although this does not conform to the organizational laws of general provincial governments, it is probably a pragmatic measure taken by the authorities to cope with the environment. Under the departments, administrative offices are established in each of the original circuits throughout Xinjiang. Currently, the offices that have been established include those in Dihua, Hami, Yili, Aksu, Kashgar, Tacheng, Yanqi, and Altai (the administrative head is named Sharif Khan, who also serves as the garrison commander; he is a Kazakh and is said to have formed his own sphere of influence). The number of counties under each district varies. There are no sound organizations of bureaus and districts under the counties. There are occasional establishments of education promotion offices and public security bureaus, but they are merely nominal. Recently, the old public security bureaus were reorganized into security bureaus, with the mission focused on border defense, and the rest being the same as ordinary police. For the local Turkic and Dungan peoples, the old system is still followed, with a special position of "Beg" established. "Beg" has the meaning of chieftain and is subject to the command of government offices to govern their people. However, unlike local officials, everything must be subject to the supervision of higher authorities and is not like the Zasag, which is inherited from generation to generation. After the Russian Revolution, the Russian Kazakhs were liberated and allowed to establish their own country in the Kyzylorda region, establishing a Kazakh government and changing from nomadic to agricultural life. Those who opposed this fled with their clans to the Altai area and gradually spread to the Tianshan Mountains. However, they are inherently fierce and skilled at robbery and murder. The local Turkic, Dungan, Mongolian, and Manchu peoples all regard them as savages. During Yang Zengxin's time, a "drive out the Kazakhs" was held every few years, driving them back north to Altai. After the Sheng Shicai's war, many Kazakh people took the opportunity to occupy the Tianshan Mountains. As a result, the Dihua-Hami road was uneasy. In the winter of 1934, hundreds of tents moved to the Zhenxi area one after another. They were also Kazakhs from Altai who had robbed Outer Mongolia and were driven here. Moreover, due to the lack of food, outrageous actions also occurred in Zhenxi, and it was reported to the Hami Garrison Command and the Administrative Office. The provincial government, upon hearing the matter, dealt with it leniently, ordering them to cultivate in designated areas in Zhenxi with assistance. If they are guided properly in the future, it may not be impossible to transform the bad into good. The new provincial government was established not long ago and has been repeatedly affected by military affairs. How effective its political measures are cannot yet be definitively judged. However, judging from the two matters of assisting Kazakh cultivation and bringing in various ethnic groups to participate in politics, it cannot be said that there is no progress. The new province has always felt a lack of political talents at all levels. In addition, due to financial difficulties and the depreciation of silver notes, public salaries are low, often insufficient to support families. Especially at the beginning of the end of the war, senior officials such as the provincial department heads and administrative heads received monthly salaries of more than 100,000 or tens of thousands of silver notes, which were not enough to buy 100 jin (approximately 110 pounds) of wheat flour. In the future, when order is restored, the people will not abandon farming, the social economy will recover, and the political situation should improve.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Xinjiang was indeed a province receiving subsidies. However, considering the discount on the province's taxes, the actual amount of subsidies was quite limited. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yang Zengxin reorganized finances, emphasizing reducing expenditure over increasing revenue. Although the subsidy was terminated, the finances could still be self-sufficient. At that time, "one tael" provincial notes were printed, amounting to approximately 10 million taels, and "two qian five fen" and "one qian" small notes, amounting to approximately 5 million taels. The notes stated that each tael was worth 400 copper coins. Although not redeemable for silver, credit was still good, equivalent to one silver dollar. In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), it was 3.4 taels. After the Russian Revolution, the new rubles circulating in Xinjiang became invalid, and the provincial notes rose to 1.7 taels. In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), it fell to 3 taels, that is, 3 silver notes could be exchanged for one silver dollar. Yang Zengxin planned to open the Altai gold mine to improve the currency system, but due to his assassination, the matter did not come to fruition. By the time of Jin Shuren, income and expenditure gradually became insufficient. Provincial notes of "three taels" and "five taels" were successively printed and issued, totaling more than 78 million taels. In addition, the war started in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), and the price of notes began to fall daily. After the coup in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), it fell directly to a price of 50 or 60 taels per yuan. Throughout the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic of China, the new government, due to the continuous war, had no tax revenue throughout the province and relied solely on printing paper notes to survive. The more notes printed, the more the price fell, and commodity prices rose, becoming an inverse ratio. It was necessary to increase the number of notes printed to barely support the military and government expenses. The dignified Department of Finance was transformed into a paper note printing agency, rushing to produce several million taels every day (see a letter from a provincial department member in Dihua in August of the 23rd year of the Republic of China). As for the wild fall in note prices, it was simply unimaginable. If large notes of "fifty taels" or more were not printed exclusively, the paper itself would not be able to sustain it. Later, fortunately, the war ended, and in the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the note price began to rise slightly, but it also hovered between 400 and 500 taels. After the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, several counties had begun to levy land taxes and commercial taxes. Although income can be expanded thereafter, with such chaotic finances, it is probably not easy to reverse the decline relying solely on the existing strength of the new province. In the past, in the Qing Dynasty, Xinjiang's paper money was issued by eight major merchants in the form of money notes. At the end of the Guangxu period, Yuan Dahua, the governor of Xinjiang, ordered the recall of commercial notes and replaced them with official notes printed in Beijing, with golden dragons painted on them, hence the name "Old Dragon Notes," amounting to approximately 1 million taels, with a higher value. When Yang Zengxin printed one-tael notes, the Old Dragon Notes gradually disappeared. From Jin Shuren to the current provincial government, paper notes have been printed every year, with denominations as large as hundreds of taels, resulting in a wild fall in note prices and an invisible increase in commodity prices. Not only did the small notes that were commonly used in the past, such as the one-qian oilcloth tickets (so called because they were printed on oilcloth) and the two-qian five-fen "dog babies" (another type of auxiliary currency) disappear long ago because they were not enough for the lowest unit price of goods, but also those of five and ten taels were also relegated to the shelf one after another, replaced by giant notes of fifty taels or more. The impact on the people is indeed beyond words (the so-called "dog babies" are a type of auxiliary currency printed with lion images, but the public mistakenly identified the lion images as small dogs, so when negotiating prices for buying and selling, they all called them so many dog babies, or added one or two oilcloth tickets, etc. According to this, ten oilcloth tickets and four dog babies each equal one tael of silver note).</p>
<h3>Japanese Establish a Puppet Head Official's Office in Eastern Chahar</h3>
<p>Enticing Villagers to Petition for a Puppet Organization to Annex Guyuan and Surrounding Areas</p>
<p>Jing He and Others Forcibly Establish Tax Collection Points in Huangyacun, Jixian County</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: Although the Japanese side has repeatedly promoted Sino-Japanese cooperation, recently the Japanese army has again established a Special Zone Administrative Head Official's Office in eastern Chahar, designating the Duolun and Guyuan 24 districts in eastern Chahar as a special zone. The office is located in Duolun, with Li Shouxin as the puppet head official. A few days ago, the office sent Japanese personnel to lead puppet police to measure maps and summon villagers in Dong Agumiao Township, Shanziliang, Koudaizi Camp, 25th River East Village, Kalu, Shuangjingzi, Niujiaogou and other places in Guyuan, enticing them to sign their names on a drafted petition. The petition requested the puppet organization to annex the Guyuan Pingdingbao area to the puppet side.</p>
<p>Han Qiqi and three other Koreans came to Huangyaguan, Jixian County, a month ago under the direction of the Japanese. They planned to find a house in Huangyacun to establish a tax collection point to collect cargo taxes from Huangyaguan. However, the villagers refused because they had no empty houses, and the Koreans left for other villages.</p>
<h3>Sino-Eastern Railway Sales Contract</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to responsible sources, the transfer contract of the Sino-Eastern Railway has been drafted and will be signed on Monday of next week by Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan Yurenev and the puppet Foreign Minister Ding Shiyuan at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that on March 22, it will still be formally signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Russian Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister will also exchange official documents, with Japan guaranteeing that "Manchukuo" will pay off the purchase price. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, a few days after the Korean left, Jing He and two other Japanese came again, forcing the villagers to find houses for them. The houses have now been repaired and taxation is being implemented. The village police station reported the facts to the Jixian County Government. County Magistrate Wang Xinggong has telegraphed the Ji-Mi Special Office for a report and plans to come to Beiping in the next few days to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation.

<h3>Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun Discusses the Difficulties of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>On the 1st of this month, the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published a lengthy article by its Beiping correspondent Heigen Yoshisaku, entitled "Can Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Be Expected from the Chinese Perspective?" The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>"Recently, there has been much talk in Tokyo about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and Sino-Japanese friendship. Our Foreign Ministry authorities are also discussing concrete plans. However, according to information received, the Chinese side, with the exception of some government authorities and a small number of economic circles, generally does not want to engage in economic cooperation with Japan. They believe that economic cooperation is a disguised policy of Japanese aggression against China, and they feel fearful and vigilant. We cannot ignore these opinions, as they are important reference materials for whether our country's (referring to Japan) expressed goodwill and planned progress can be realized. Here is a special introduction: First, regarding the premise of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the fundamental condition is to prohibit anti-Japanese activities. The Chinese side believes that China's anti-Japanese resistance is deeply rooted. If Japan wants to eliminate the Chinese people's spirit of resistance, it must first remove the root cause. What is the cause? It is the resolution of the Manchurian problem. If we hastily change our attitude and talk about cooperation and assistance, it is foolish and an insult to the Chinese people who do not understand this. Second, they believe that Sino-Japanese cooperation is for the unilateral benefit of Japan and does not originate from China's interests. Why? 1. Because Japanese goods have gradually lost overseas sales channels, and the only way is to expand into China. 2. To prepare for the emergency in 1936, we are urgently seeking economic development in China. 3. Because the economic situation within Japan, apart from the military industry, is becoming increasingly impoverished. There is no other way to overcome the difficulties other than to seek to open up the difficulties with China. Therefore, the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is exactly equivalent to the economic control of Japan and Manchuria. In other words, it is the economic control of East Asia centered on Japan. Third, regarding the form of Japanese technical assistance and trade settlement with loans, they believe that technical assistance and financial investment, in principle, are harmless, but contain political significance and increase the risk of Japanese intervention. As a result, Japan will inevitably seize China's rights and manipulate China's sovereignty, turning China into a colony. Fourth, they believe that China's finances do not need foreign assistance. If we simply cut a few million troops, there is no need to worry about insufficient finances. If the spirit of the whole country can be invigorated and self-reliant, why worry about the economic downturn? Seeking help from Japan now is tantamount to inviting a wolf into the house. Fifth, providing the market to Japan and being exclusively occupied by Japan will provoke the opposition of various countries in the world and lead to a war between Japan and the countries. As a result, China will inevitably perish with Japan. In short, the Chinese side believes that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is originally Japan's intention to drive out the political, diplomatic, and economic forces of European and American countries in China and occupy them exclusively. Today, the Japanese government and the public beautifully call it assistance to China's restoration, but in fact, Japan will monopolize China's political and economic means."</p>
<h3>Shenyang Citibank Suddenly Announces Closure Due to the Impact of the Puppet Organization's Kerosene Monopoly</h3>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that Citibank's Fengtian branch, as a representative of American economic power, was on par with the British-owned Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) in Manchuria, occupying the throne of foreign banks. Unexpectedly, after the Manchurian Incident, it gradually lost its original position. In addition, due to the turmoil in the American financial community, its recent business has become increasingly weak. Although the heads of the bank are currently doing their best to consult with the Consul General stationed in Shenyang to restore the situation, Mr. Peter, the branch manager of the bank, suddenly announced that it would be closed by May 31. It is said that in the era of the end of the Taisho period in Japan, the bank occupied a prominent advantage in the Manchurian economic world due to the popularity of anti-Japanese and pro-American policies. This sudden announcement of the suspension of business, according to those familiar with the content, is not due to poor business performance, but is due to the significant political impact of Manchuria's oil policy and tariff policy. At present, the Fengtian financial community has caused a major shock.</p>
<h3>Decline of Special Industries in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Ganzhou communication: Ganzhou is located in the upper reaches of the Gan River and connects to the various regions of Guangdong. It is the commercial center of southern Jiangxi. In recent years, the local area has suffered greatly from banditry, resulting in extremely depressed commerce. Even the three special products of timber, sugar, and water chestnut flour, which have always been major export commodities, are declining daily, which has a huge impact on the economic income of rural areas in southern Jiangxi. It is said that southern Jiangxi is a timber-rich area. In years of high sales, the total value of exports is approximately 7 million yuan. The entire amount relies on wood merchants in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou and other ports to wholesale and resell. In recent years, due to the area of Upper Jiangxi falling into the bandit zone, it has been difficult to purchase and transport. When the water rose in Upper Jiangxi last summer, Gan wood rafts were stopped because they did not have a travel permit from the Xingying. By the time they received the permit, the water had receded and the river was dry, making it impossible to transport. Although various wood merchants had received approval from the Xingying last winter to reissue shallow water wood raft transport permits, changing large rafts to small rafts for transportation, the project was large and it was still difficult to reorganize and travel smoothly. In addition, the various wood firms in Jiangsu Province believed that the Guang wood produced in Changde, Hunan, was of better quality than the western wood and was cheaper, meeting the needs of users. Therefore, those who previously operated the Western wood have shifted their attention and are tending to collect and transport Hengchang wood. Last year, the sales volume of Western wood in Jiangsu was only five-tenths of that in previous years. The sales market was taken, and there was a general decline. Secondly, the sugar industry is also a major product of southern Jiangxi and is the place where sugar manufacturing was first created in my country. The total annual export value is no less than one million yuan. It is only due to banditry and river obstruction and inconvenient transportation that those who used to purchase Gan sugar from various places now mostly use foreign sugar. At the same time, due to the depletion of the rural economy, the cost of growing sugarcane is higher. The sugarcane land is planted with other crops, resulting in a large decrease in yield. The original sugar firms have closed down one after another. In total, the number of sugar barrels exported last year was only a few thousand. Therefore, in recent years, the sugar industry in southern Jiangxi has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Recently, it has been heard that the authorities attach great importance to the sugar manufacturing industry and plan to use machine pressing and manufacturing to improve products and increase production. Also, this year, banditry has been suppressed, and the industry still has hope of revival. The third is water chestnut flour, whose annual output and export volume are no less than sugar. Recently, Hunan's foreign sweet potato flour has been sold well in the Yangtze River area, and because the quality and taste are equal to water chestnut flour, the output is large and the price is cheap, so sales have been greatly impacted. In addition, frequent droughts in Ganzhou reduce the output of water chestnuts, and the industry is declining.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Police Arrest Gambling Bandits and Open Fire</h3>
<p>Yun Fubao's tea shop in Wenshu, Xixiashu Town, Third District of Wuyi County, is open for gambling, with Pai Gow and poker being readily available. Yue Shikun, the patrol captain of the Security Branch Team and the Second Public Security Sub-Station stationed in Xixiashu Town, heard about the matter and went to investigate and arrest on the evening of the 6th. When they arrived, the gamblers were at the height of excitement. When they saw the police team arrive, they fled one after another. The boss Yun Fubao and gamblers Xie Jinchuan and others were arrested on the spot, as well as many gambling tools. During the chaos, a gunshot was suddenly heard in the field, causing a bullet to hit the left arm of villager Ji Liubao, who was seriously injured. Afterwards, the village chief of the village picked up a bullet casing. He took the injured to Wujin Hospital in the city for treatment on the 7th and suspected that the shooter was from the police team. He immediately went to the team headquarters to question them about not opening fire and injuring people. The team headquarters denied it at the time. After checking the bullet casing, it did not match what was used by the police team. It was clear that there were other bandits causing trouble and shooting, and it is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Douye Opens Dredging Shuqiao River</h3>
<p>Wuyi Douye Market is known as the crown of Jiangsu Province. In recent years, the number of Douye transported by train to Changzhou has been extremely large. The Douye Trade Association has discussed with the station to build a freight station for storage. However, this batch of Douye must be transshipped to the Xishi River for trading, but the Shuqiao River through which it passes is becoming increasingly shallow. Special funds have been raised to hire workers to dredge immediately. Three days later, a letter was sent to the County Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the County Government to provide protection.</p>
<h3>Nantong District Township Mayor Training Institute Opens</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Training Institute for Township Mayors of the six counties of Nantong, Tongru, Haichong, Qijing, opened on the 7th. Commissioner Zheng of Nantong District gave a training speech, hoping that the township mayors would pay attention to local security, cultivate harmony in townships and towns, strongly encourage the people to settle disputes, and promote local construction.</p>
<h3>Changshu Shatian Disputes Resolved Over the Years</h3>
<p>The Shatian dispute in the Seventh District of this county has been a long-standing issue. When fighting over the surrounding beaches, there were often fights, disregarding life. As a result, there were many accumulated cases and the government could not solve them. Last year, the Welfare Company fought over more than 2,000 mu of Shatian in various small cases. Both parties submitted documents to the Department of Finance, each holding its own opinion. Subsequently, the Department of Finance made a final ruling in June last year, temporarily lending four-tenths of the Shatian in each small case to the Welfare Company for management, and giving it back first in one go when the tide continues to rise. There must be no further disputes after this. If there is a request for payment, the government must conduct a joint survey before the price can be paid and claimed. If there is any further reliance on force and fighting, the leaders will be arrested and severely punished. However, the implementation of this ruling is very difficult and has been delayed until now. Now, County Magistrate Qu has received a provincial order to resolve it immediately, and to order boundaries, hoping to achieve lasting resolution. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Zhai first summoned all relevant persons to the county for talks on the 5th. All the representatives except the Welfare Company attended. It was decided that on the 10th of this month, personnel would be sent to the township with the Shatian Bureau Director to order boundaries. The disputes over the years will be resolved from now on.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Department of Finance Reforms Shatian in Various Counties</h3>
<p>The Shatian Bureau system in various counties of Jiangsu Province is poor and the organization is unsound, causing misunderstandings among the people. In the previous month, the Taixing County Party Department and the Party Departments of Jing County unanimously advocated that the provincial government abolish the Shatian Bureaus in various counties. According to news from the Department of Finance, the Shatian Bureaus in various counties have no fixed funding and mostly extract 30% of the tax revenue as all expenses. In counties with more Shatian, there is no pain, or there is a small surplus. In counties with fewer fields, those in charge of bureau affairs must find ways to obtain income and make expenditures, resulting in the proliferation of current abuses and causing people to suffer. Now the Department is striving to reform, and the method is still being actively prepared. Once the method is prepared, it will be submitted to the Provincial Government for meeting and approval, and implemented effectively.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Prefecture Restricts Embezzlement of Laborers' Allowances</h3>
<p>When Wei County recruited laborers to build roads, the Construction Department stipulated a method for providing tea and water allowances to the laborers. Now, the Department believes that while many district and township chiefs in charge of recruiting laborers in various counties are loyal and dedicated, there are also not a few who collude in corruption and embezzle laborers' allowances. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the county government, stating that in future labor recruitment, if there are tea and water allowances, the approved amount and the method of distribution and receipt should be publicly announced to all. The responsible personnel should be strictly supervised to faithfully implement the regulations, and the stipulated earthwork and tea water allowances must be issued according to the law, with every drop going to the people. If any responsible personnel are found to have underpaid or embezzled labor funds, they will be punished according to the law without any concealment or leniency once discovered.</p>

<h3>Gaoyou County Farmers Commit Suicide Due to Poverty</h3>
<p>Zhou Guicai, a farmer in Guoqiao, about three miles from the fifth district of this county, is 45 years old this year. His wife, Wang, has one son and two daughters. He has no permanent property and only farms 20 acres of land. During the Qingli New Year, Zhou could not repay the debts he owed, and became ill with worry. He only recovered the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 5th), the creditor came to his house to demand payment urgently. Wang begged the creditor, Mr. Wu, to allow him to repay the debt later. Wu reluctantly left. Zhou, however, felt that he could not raise the money and that life was difficult, so he had the thought of ending his life. He hanged himself in the night while his family was asleep. This morning, when Wang got up, she found that Zhou had been dead for a long time. It is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin County Yangku Zhaoxing Pawnshop Closes Down</h3>
<p>Yangku Zhaoxing Pawnshop in the fourth district, with a capital of 56,000 yuan, has been open for more than 60 years. The common people in the eastern countryside have benefited greatly. Recently, due to the impact of the market and poor capital turnover, the manager, Zhou Songwei, suddenly announced the closure of the business on the afternoon of the 6th, only accepting redemption and delaying the lawyer Zhouhou to declare liquidation. Local people in the town believe that the closure of the pawnshop is related to the economy of the common people in the eastern countryside. In the evening, they gathered at the town office to discuss the aftermath, but there was no result. District Chief Chen Mingchen reported to County Chief Yan by telephone that night, requesting instructions on rescue measures.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou County Lantern Festival Disaster in Longyou</h3>
<p>All sectors of Longyou County held a lantern celebration rally on the evening of the 6th of this month to celebrate the victory in suppressing bandits. At 8:00 p.m., the participants in the lantern parade gathered under the Longyou Bridge to depart. Thousands of people went to watch the lanterns. At that time, there were more than a thousand men and women villagers standing on the Longyou Bridge to watch the lanterns. At this time, a highway bus passed through the bridge from Longkaiqu. The villagers caught a glimpse of the bus and panicked too much, scrambling to escape under the bridge. Seeing this, the bus immediately stopped moving forward, but the villagers continued to push and trample each other, and the order was greatly disturbed. Unexpectedly, the stone bridge had been in disrepair for a long time, and the stone railings collapsed. About a hundred villagers were squeezed and fell into the water. Fortunately, they were rescued on the spot, but 22 people had already drowned. Local people attributed the disaster to the bus and carried the corpses to the Longyou Bus Station to negotiate. The situation was serious. The Provincial Highway Bureau reported that it had sent Deputy Director Wu Zhitian to investigate the cause of the accident.</p>

<h3>Haimen County Township Chief Exploits Villagers</h3>
<p>Since taking office last winter, Xu Yueying, the township chief of Dayou Township in the third district, has abused his power and exploited the villagers. Zhang Zhibei and other villagers' representatives have filed a complaint with the county government. County Chief Chen has sent someone to investigate thoroughly. Xu did not change his old ways. On the afternoon of the 23rd, he arrested the villager Mao Shoufang on the pretext of conscription, hid him without a trace, and ordered Mao's wife to pay a fine of 40 yuan before he could be released. Mao's wife begged Xu because her family was poor and unable to raise the money, but she was beaten and injured by Xu. Yesterday (the 24th), Mao's wife has petitioned the county government to investigate.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing County National Exhibition Scheduled to Be Held</h3>
<p>The third National Goods Exhibition in Shaoxing has been approved by party and government agencies and is ready for preparation. The silk and cloth industry and other seven trade associations believe that the rural economy in Shaoxing is bankrupt and purchasing power is extremely weak, and they are deeply worried that manufacturers from Shanghai and Hangzhou will come to Shaoxing from afar, resulting in losses. They sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday requesting a postponement. Because the goods of various factories have been shipped out, it is too late to stop them. It has now been decided that the opening ceremony will be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 12th of this month. The venue is located in Kaiyuan Temple, and the duration is about three weeks.</p>
<h3>Songjiang County The Head of the Second District Resigns</h3>

He has been diligent and conscientious in his work and has achieved remarkable results, which has always been praised by local people. Recently, he suddenly submitted a request to the county to resign from his position again due to the issue of district merger. He is very determined to leave. It is now learned that the county government has approved it and has selected Li Shihua from this district to succeed him. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has approved the appointment, and the appointment order has been issued yesterday. Chen Changshan, the head of the third district, has also been appointed as the supervisor. The handover will take place separately in the near future.</p>
<h3>The Eighth District Robbery Case</h3>
<p>He Yanfu, a villager in Youche Township, the eighth district, has a well-off family. Suddenly, on the evening of the 4th, more than a dozen thieves came and fired shots to show their power, forcing the victim to point out the place where the silver was hidden. When they failed, they stripped the victim's clothes and burned his lower body with wax candles, which was unbearable to see. As a result, about 200 yuan worth of silver and jewelry was robbed and the thieves fled. Afterwards, the local people reported to the Shanyang Police Station and asked for investigation. The victim was seriously injured and sought medical treatment on his own.</p>
<h3>Kunshan County Fire in Xujialou Village</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10 o'clock, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Xu Fugeng, a farmer in Xujialou Village, Rongzhuang Township, west of the city. In an instant, it broke through the roof. At that time, the villagers were working in the fields and rushed back to the scene to put out the fire upon hearing the alarm. However, the fire had already spread and there was a lack of firefighting equipment. They let the fire spread until it was extinguished at noon. In addition to the ten houses of Tang Fugeng's family being completely destroyed, it also affected seven other families, including Tang Fenglin, destroying more than 30 houses, burning more than 100 stones of rice, and countless farm boats and agricultural tools. The loss was huge, which can be said to be tragic.</p>
<h3>Wuxi County The Public Property Office Asks to Stop the New House Donation</h3>
<p>The revision of the new chapter on house donation in Jiangsu Province has aroused opposition from chambers of commerce in various counties in Suzhou and Wuxi, who have appealed for a stop. The matter has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Qian Jihou and Chen Zuolin, directors of the County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office of this county, also believe that Jiangsu Province has arbitrarily revised the house donation without legal procedures, increasing the burden on the people. Therefore, yesterday, they specifically sent a telegram to the Yuan Department requesting an immediate stop to clarify the system and attach importance to tax administration. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To Wang, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Kong, Minister of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee in Zhenjiang: The revised new chapter on house donation in Jiangsu Province increases the tax rate and levies on housing. Regardless of the increased burden, at this time when the local area is declining and after a major disaster, it is impossible for the people to bear it. Even from the perspective of the financial system, the revenue and expenditure of the province and county should be divided. The central government has long had a method, and the second National Financial Conference last year also determined the principles. The important ones are three: (1) Regarding the revenue and expenditure of counties and cities, those originally belonging to the counties and cities and their districts, townships, etc., should be combined into one; (2) Regarding the division of expenditure, it should be based on the affiliation of the purpose of its agencies and business facilities, so that the rights and obligations of the people in various places can be fairly averaged; (3) After the province and counties and cities are divided, they shall not be added to each other in order to reorganize themselves. In the declaration of the conference, it was stated in more detail that the method of determining the local budget should be based on the budget system as the key to the tax administration. The division of national taxes and local taxes was determined at the first National Financial Conference, but the division of provincial local taxes and county local taxes is still lacking. This conference decided that from now on, the standards for local revenue and expenditure of provinces and counties must be divided in detail, such as the precedent of dividing national taxes and local taxes at the first National Financial Conference, and unified revenue and expenditure must be orderly, and we must strive to avoid political gatherings, where resolutions are not made and resolutions are not implemented. For all resolutions, those belonging to the local area, such as additional exemptions and the abolition of harsh taxes, are expected to be implemented by the local authorities. It is now found that the house donation in Jiangsu Province has always been a county local tax and should be included in the reorganization of each. According to Article 4 of the Provisional Law of Central Supervision of Local Finance, any increase must be consulted with the Ministry of Finance for record. The procedure is extremely solemn. However, this time, the Jiangsu Province revised the house donation, increasing the local burden, and no one in the urban and rural areas was spared. It was not discussed publicly by the county according to law, but was hastily passed by the provincial government meeting. According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Law of Central Supervision of Local Finance, it is not allowed to be implemented. The tax and assessment of the Song and Ming Dynasties were actually bad policies in the last days. In the late Qing Dynasty, there was no money for police expenses, so house donations were temporarily used to make up for them, calling them donations instead of taxes, which still had a temporary meaning. Fortunately, in this enlightened era of the Party and the country, we are working hard to avoid harsh taxes and disturbing the people. Even if it is difficult to remove them immediately, how can we bear to increase them again? This office is located in the local area and is responsible for revenue and expenditure. For the provincial and county local governments, we should only obey legal supervision, but we dare not deceive each other, increase the burden on the people, and only share the blame for the government, and instead be blamed by the local people. The matter is not related to the heart and is even more uneasy. We dare to take the liberty to report the truth and sincerely request that you approve and accept it and immediately stop the implementation in order to clarify the system and attach importance to finance. Do not appoint an agent to wait for orders. It is said that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the opposition from various chambers of commerce and public groups, has decided to hand it over to the Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee for further comments and detailed rules, and to extend the implementation to July 1. However, this matter is not to increase revenue for the provincial treasury, but purely for the sake of public security in various counties, and it is hoped that the counties will understand. When the Donation and Tax Supervision Committee holds a meeting on the 10th of this month, the Civil and Finance Departments will send personnel to attend and state everything.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Minister Kong's Statement: The Government Takes into Account the National Interest in Finance</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Shanghai, 8th: Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi issued the following statement tonight: In recent days, a certain foreign news agency, with the authorization of a certain party authority, has repeatedly spread news that the government will take certain measures on finance, such as stipulating the exchange rate ratio. Such rumors are not worth denying, but I am afraid that the rumors are untrue and will be misrepresented, so I will make a special statement. In short, if the government takes any measures, it will definitely take into account the national interest, and if there is any announcement, it will be issued by the appropriate agency.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Responds to City Chamber of Commerce: Fundamentally Rescuing the Market is Being Carefully Planned Now; Exemption of Tax on Public Debt Transactions is Under Review by the Yuan</h3>
<p>Reply by Telegram</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed back to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, asking it to plan fundamental measures to rescue the market. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce reviewed the telegram and understood its contents. Since recent years, the financial market in our country has been affected by the global economic recession and the increase in silver prices, resulting in a drop in prices and difficulties in capital turnover in various industries. The Ministry has long taken this into account and has repeatedly negotiated with the Central, China, and Transportation Banks to lend huge sums of money for regulation. The new and old year-ends can be passed smoothly. This is something that everyone has seen. The contents of the incoming telegram are true. As for fundamental rescue measures, the Ministry is now carefully planning. If the members of the Chamber of Commerce have any opinions, they can state them in detail. The Ministry will adopt the best ones. At this time of crisis, we must unite from top to bottom in order to stabilize the crisis and reassure the people. Please do not disturb each other in advance. This is most important. (Signed) Song Qianyin, Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Official Reply</p>

The original text is recorded as follows: According to the forwarded letter from the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange and the association of brokers, requesting to exempt national debt securities from taxation in the Transaction Tax Law, and according to the Shanghai Banking Association's telegram, the situation is the same as before. After reviewing the various sections presented, they are not without reason. In addition to submitting the proposal to the Executive Yuan and the political affairs meeting for examination and verification, and transferring it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and revision, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange and the Banking Association are instructed to check accordingly.

<h3>This City's Women's Circles Unanimously Celebrate "March 8th" Yesterday - Various Women's Organizations Hold Commemorative Meetings - The Women's Education Center Also Holds an Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday was "March 8th" International Women's Day. Women's circles in this city held separate commemorative ceremonies. The Municipal Women's Association held one at the Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road. The Women's Progressive Association held one at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge. The Women's Great Alliance held one at the YMCA at Baxianqiao. There was also the Women's Education Center holding an opening ceremony. The details of each are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Women's Association</p>
<p>Yesterday was the March 8th International Women's Day. The Shanghai Municipal Women's Association, the highest women's movement organization in this city, held a large-scale commemoration. In addition to issuing a proclamation to women to encourage them, the association also invited Mayor Wu's wife and others to give radio speeches at 10:00 AM. In the afternoon, a commemorative meeting was held at the Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road. Attendees included party and government representatives, famous women from China and abroad, representatives from various girls' schools and factories, as well as more than 4,000 women citizens from industrial, commercial, academic, and family circles. Every seat was filled, truly an unprecedented grand occasion in Shanghai's women's movement. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Morning Radio Broadcast: At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the association specially invited Mayor Wu's wife, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Ms. Lin Kecong, and Ms. Shu Huizhen to give radio speeches at the China-West, Wah Mei, and Asia Sound companies. The significance of the March 8th festival was explained in great detail.</p>
<p>Commemorative Meeting: At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the association erected a large white cloth in front of the Wenmiao Park entrance of the Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road, with the words "Shanghai Municipal Women's Association Commemorative International Women's Day Meeting" written on it. Inside the venue, meaningful slogans were hung everywhere, a dazzling array, magnificent and clean.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Grand Occasion: The news of the Municipal Women's Association holding a Women's Day commemorative meeting had spread throughout the city. Therefore, after 12:00 PM, the women's masses flocked to the venue with their tickets. By 1:00 PM, the venue was already packed with people, with no empty seats. At the same time, the number of guests outside the venue became increasingly enthusiastic, and the road was blocked. Upon witnessing this situation, the meeting authorities immediately changed their approach, arranging long benches outside the venue to accommodate the masses. The lively scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreigners All Present: Yesterday's attendees included, on an individual basis, Municipal Party Department representative Mao Yun, famous women such as Mayor Wu's wife, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, former Legislative Yuan members Wang Xiaoying, Huang Bingpei, Chen Hongbi, and others. On an organizational basis, there were representatives from more than 50 schools such as China Girls' High School, Ai Qun, Shang Wen, He An, Min Li, Daxia, Nanyang, and Shanghai, as well as women representatives from more than 30 factories such as Shen Xin and Wing On, as well as all the directors and members of the association, and women citizens from agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, and family circles who participated voluntarily. In addition, there were more than 20 female representatives from countries such as Germany and France. It is estimated that there were no less than 4,000 people in the entire venue. All sectors gathered, Chinese and foreigners all present. This kind of grand occasion truly broke the record of Shanghai's women's movement.</p>
<p>Meeting Staff: The presidium included Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Wang Xiaoying, Lin Kecong, Jin Shiyin, Wang Wenzhao, Wang Jisi, Luo Gengyang, Zhang Sujun, Shu Huizhen, and Jin Qingfen. The secretaries were Huang Xiaotong and Shen Xun'er. The master of ceremonies was Jin Zhi Mi. The reception staff included Lin Yuxiang, Yao Lifang, Shen Yongqing, She Guyin, He Kewen, Huang Zhixia, Yao Shiqin, Weng Huijun, and Weng Huiyao. The order was maintained by the girl scouts of the Liangjiang Girls' School.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Lin Kecong reported, briefly stating that today is a day for women around the world to seek liberation. Twenty-six years ago, American women, unable to bear the social discrimination and unequal treatment, rose up in protest to seek their own liberation. The following year, a female leader of the socialist movement convened a conference in the capital of Denmark, making further progress in the struggle and designating March 8th as International Women's Day. The significance of our commemoration of March 8th today lies first in examining the status of Chinese women, so that we can then formulate the direction of our future struggle. What is the status of Chinese women today? Frankly speaking, there are many areas of practical inequality. Therefore, we should unite and continue the aspirations of our predecessors to struggle, and at the same time, we should struggle for the entire nation, and so on.</p>
<p>Party Department Speech: Municipal Party Department representative Mao Yun delivered a speech, briefly stating that the significance of Women's Day is for women to seek their own liberation. For Chinese women to seek liberation, first, they should cultivate intelligence and improve morality; second, they should eliminate bad habits and practice a new life; and third, they should engage in production to consolidate the foundation of the nation.</p>
<p>Celebrity Speeches: Mayor Wu's wife briefly stated that today is International Women's Day, that is, a day for women all over the world to seek liberation. Today, as we commemorate this festival, we should first reflect on our own weaknesses and then seek the path to liberation. The weakness of Chinese women lies in their lack of knowledge and ability, which has led to them being subject to domination. In the future, we must invigorate ourselves and strive to be strong, seek knowledge and cultivate ability at all times and in all places, so that we can liberate ourselves and the country can become strong. Mrs. Cai Yuanpei briefly stated that this year's March 8th commemorative meeting is more grand than last year's, which is truly gratifying. Women internationally have mostly achieved the goal of liberation, and have made ten thousand times more progress in science, politics, and various other fields. However, Chinese women have not yet been able to realize liberation, so we should strive to cultivate ourselves and seek advancement in knowledge and personality. Ms. Wang Xiaoying briefly stated: (1) The women's movement is encountering great obstacles today. This obstacle is the same in China and abroad. Germany is calling for women to return to the family and be good wives and mothers. The United States is experiencing an unemployment panic, and married women are returning to the family. In Guangdong and Guangxi, men and women cannot travel together. Women are not allowed to do this, not allowed to do that, but there is no similar prohibition for men. In fact, as long as our decorations do not harm morality, we can do whatever we want, and there is no need for others to interfere. (2) As for calling on women to return to the family and simply be good wives and mothers, it is even more illogical, because the family is formed by the combination of men and women, society is formed by the combination of men and women, and the country is formed by the combination of men and women. Therefore, social undertakings need women's participation, just as the family needs women. (3) Chinese women should (a) acquire skills to make a living, and (b) practice unity in order to seek liberation. (4) Finally, I would like to offer with twelve points of sincerity that everyone must not return to the family to live the life of a young lady, young mistress, or wife.</p>
<p>Wonderful Entertainment: Female soldiers from Shangwen Elementary School, Mei Manzhang's sword dance from He'an School, Pingju singing by Ma Yuqin and Fu Yaqin, etc.</p>
<p>Valuable Gifts: China, Shanghai, and the two national goods companies, as well as all the national goods factories in Shanghai, had valuable gifts to distribute to the guests at the venue. After the photography, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Women's Progressive Association</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Women's Progressive Association convened women's circles from the city at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road to hold an entertainment meeting. Famous women from the women's circles, such as Mayor Wu's wife, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, and Mrs. Wu Yun Chu, were invited to the meeting to give speeches, and a women's issue speech contest was held. Mayor Wu's wife, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Yu Qingtang, Shu Zhirui, Bu Zhenhua, Wu Maoyuan, and others attended, as well as Municipal Party Department representative Wang Longzhang, Social Bureau representative He Jingyuan, the presidium Yan Zhenyu, Qiu Xisheng, Yang Zhihao, Jin Guangmei, and Wu Daiyi, secretaries Tang Naiqi, Song Ziyu, and Li Xiangjun, reception staff Fan Zhiping, General Director Wu Daiyi, Chen Yongsheng, and more than 2,000 women guests from all walks of life. Female students were particularly numerous. However, because there was a sign posted at the door refusing to receive male guests, the venue was almost entirely female, except for news reporters, representatives of organizations, and police officers dispatched by the Public Security Bureau. The entire Boy Scout troop of Wu Ben maintained order at the venue.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Speeches: The meeting began at 2:00 PM. The presidium and attending guests, such as Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Ms. Zhou Jun, Yu Qingtang, and Shu Zhirui, all gave speeches. Some introduced the history of Women's Day, while others discussed the direction the women's movement should take in the future. However, they all expressed dissatisfaction with the current women's movement. (The words of the leaders are omitted) Mayor Wu's wife, due to a hoarse voice, specially submitted her original speech manuscript to be read by Yang Zhihao on her behalf. An excerpt is as follows: Today is the day when women from all countries, unwilling to be oppressed by society, began to seek liberation and equality. It is also the starting day for the actual women's movement in various countries. The Chinese women's movement has also had more than 20 years of history, but it has not yet enabled women to achieve thorough liberation and equality. On the one hand, this is due to the difficulty in breaking the historical environment's discrimination against men and women and the habits; on the other hand, it is indeed because women themselves lack too much cultivation and training in academic ability and talent. The past women's movement has awakened the infatuated women. In the future, women compatriots should implement the following points as the only shortcut to achieve economic, educational, occupational, and political equality between men and women, and should pay attention to: (1) Enrich academic studies; (2) Pay attention to the cultivation and training of social occupations and political activities; (3) Practice the New Life Movement, reform bad old customs, and abolish vanity.</p>
<p>Speech Contest: At around 4:00 PM, the speech contest began, with the topic "How to Be a New Woman." Each person was limited to five minutes. Yu Qingtang, Shu Zhirui, Yang Zhihao, Jin Guangmei, and others were invited as judges. As a result, the first place went to Tu Kunying from Shanghai Girls' High School, the second place went to Shi Xiumen from Patriotic Girls' High School, the third place went to Tu Tongjun from Shanghai High School, and the fourth place went to Li Shuhua from Wu Ben Girls' High School. In addition to the association's silver shield, the prizes included silver shields, mirror frames, etc. from Mayor Wu, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Tong Hangbai, Lu Jingshi, Jiang Huaizhu, and Wang Manyun, a landscape painting by Ms. Yang Xuejiu, a copy of the Women's Library from the Women's Bookstore, and a full-year subscription to Women's Monthly for all participants in the speech contest, which were awarded by the association's executive directors, Mrs. Wu Yun Chu and Ms. Wu Daiyi.</p>
<p>Entertainment Performance: After the speeches, the entertainment meeting opened. Wu Ben Girls' High School, Shanghai Girls' High School, the Municipal Council Girls' High School, and Shanghai Elementary School all had wonderful programs. The "Radio Performance" by the Municipal Council Girls' High School was particularly outstanding. In addition, national goods daily necessities were distributed to the guests, with a total of more than 2,300 numbers issued. The monosodium glutamate donated by the Tianchu MSG Factory was the most numerous. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Women's League</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: The Chinese Women's League, in commemoration of the March 8th Festival, specially contacted women's circles in countries such as England, the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Portugal, Mexico, and Korea to hold a grand ceremony at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Before that, at 12:00 PM at noon, a luncheon was held on the ninth floor of the YMCA. 150 to 160 women attended, gathering together and enjoying themselves. After the meal, the commemorative meeting was held. After the ceremony, the chairman, Chen Lingyi, first reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, British representative Mrs. Lan Luli gave a speech, and American representative Ms. Smith gave a speech, both translated by Liu Wang Liming. Japanese representative Mrs. Sakamoto gave a speech, translated by Wang Ruizhu. Ms. Bi Peder of the Peace Prayer Association and Ms. Jiang Junmeng, who had recently returned from Europe, also gave speeches. The meeting staff included Chen Lingyi, Liu Wang Liming, Wang Xiaoying, Liu Jichen, Chen Yongsheng, Ling Jixi, Zhu Baoliang, Wang Ruizhu, Liang Weihua, Chen Fenggong, Guo Qiyi, Huang Danzai, and Shi Liang. Chen Lingyi, Liu Wang Liming, and Wang Xiaoying served as the presidium. A special March 8th commemorative publication was distributed on the spot to make it easier for all sectors to understand the meaning of the women's movement. After the speeches were completed, proposals were discussed. Then, four ladies presented flowers to the martyr Qiu Jin, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: Mrs. Lan Sili's speech mainly stated that in the past, women's activities were mostly limited to participation in politics. In the future, we should pay attention to the true meaning of equality and freedom, strive towards the bright road, and achieve universal development. Ms. Si Misi briefly stated that gender equality has gradually progressed. Europe and the United States are only maintaining their inherent positions, while East Asia is fighting for equality. Mrs. Sakamoto advocated the system of good wives and loving mothers. Ms. Bi Peder said that gender equality should be promoted through practical work. Ms. Wang Xiaomeng said that in addition to politics and society, gender equality must also pay close attention to equality and cooperation in the family and build a solid foundation. Other representatives from various countries, due to time constraints, did not have the opportunity to speak. The main points of the proposal were: (1) Promote compulsory education, reduce illiteracy, and seek equality in culture; (2) Unite women from all walks of life to jointly call for equal rights; (3) Protect female workers and ask the government to formulate separate female factory laws.</p>
<p>The Fourth Person from Right to Left in the Front Row Presidium: Mayor Wu's Wife, Ms. Lin Kecong, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei.</p>

<h3>Internal Tugboats Collide in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning - Iron Barge Sinks, Jiangshun Damaged</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Changjiang Jiangshun, which departed from Shanghai for Hankou yesterday morning, collided with a Jardine Matheson tugboat in front of the Ruirong Factory. The iron barge sank immediately, and the Jiangshun returned to the dock for inspection. It resumed its journey to Hankou this morning and will undergo major repairs upon its return to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangshun to Hankou</p>
<p>The Jiangshun was carrying 18,556 pieces of cargo and 83 first-class cabin passengers, as well as more than 1,000 steerage passengers. It left the Jinliyuan Wharf at 4:45 AM yesterday morning. As it was traveling in the Huangpu River, the captain, W. Mcllwani, was only running at half speed. When the ship turned past Lujiazui and arrived in front of the Ruirong Shipyard, at the tenth and eleventh channel buoys, the Taikoo Shipping Company's Yangtze River ship Wuhu was also exiting at the same time, sailing ahead. The Jiangshun was traveling behind the Wuhu. At this time, the river surface was still dark, but a foreign ship was seen ahead with three red lights, sailing into the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Foreign Ship Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>When the Jiangshun sailed to the channel buoys, Captain Mcllwani glimpsed a foreign ship loaded with timber coming to Shanghai, named the Alnmoor, displaying three red lights. It was being guided into port by a foreign pilot hired from Wusong, Fleming. Before the Alnmoor timber ship, there was a large Jardine Matheson iron barge, named the Alnmoor, which appeared to be intended to tow the timber ship. However, when the Taikoo Wuhu passed through the area, the iron barge had not yet moved laterally. The Jiangshun followed closely behind. Unexpectedly, the iron barge's hull suddenly moved laterally in front of the Jiangshun's bow.</p>
<p>Two Ships Collide</p>
<p>When the iron barge moved laterally in front of the Jiangshun's bow, the Jiangshun saw the iron barge's red light on the left and green light on the right. At that time, it was high tide. The Jiangshun quickly pulled a whistle, but there was no response. When the second whistle was pulled, the iron barge was approaching the bow. The Jiangshun quickly stopped and put the engines in full reverse, but it was too late to avoid the collision. At this time, the iron barge's starboard side collided violently with the Jiangshun. This was around 5:00 AM. The Jiangshun's starboard side was hit by the large iron barge. This was the situation at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>Sinking Very Fast</p>
<p>Due to the collision, the Alnmoor iron barge's hull was smashed into the Jiangshun's starboard side, causing the iron barge's hull to be caught on the Jiangshun's starboard anchor hook. At this time, the Jiangshun's captain, Mcllwani, asked the iron barge's crew whether the barge was flooding. All the sailors and workers on the barge only then saw the river water rushing into the cabin. Fortunately, the hull was caught on the Jiangshun's starboard anchor hook, preventing it from sinking immediately. They then launched lifeboats to escape. Some of the sailors and crew jumped into the Jiangshun. Fortunately, no one was killed. However, according to the Jiangshun's chief mate, Li Guosan, they took advantage of the situation to try to send the barge to the riverbank to ground it in shallow water. Unexpectedly, the hull shifted slightly and, affected by the tidal current, the barge broke free from the iron anchor and immediately capsized in the Huangpu River. It sank in just four minutes.</p>
<p>Jiangshun's Losses</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Jiangshun quickly put the engines in reverse, so only the bow was hit with a large hole. Seven iron plates were cracked, the starboard anchor hole was completely destroyed, the anchor chain was also damaged, and the second-floor platform of the bow was completely destroyed. The keel was also damaged. Also, when the barge fell over, the mast on the ship fell down and broke the glass windows of the bridge. The damage was extremely heavy. According to the Jiangshun's crew, if the reverse gear had been slower and the ship had been hit between the two cabins, the Jiangshun would have been cut in two, and all 2,000 passengers would have fallen into the river. Fortunately, the captain saw the danger and avoided a major tragedy. The Jiangshun immediately returned to the Jinliyuan Wharf and docked at 6:10 AM. The captain immediately reported to the General Bureau and the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>Sailing Today</p>
<p>The Jiangshun had many passengers and a lot of cargo. After the damage to the bow was inspected by the General Bureau's engineer and the captain, it was determined that although the losses were huge, the damage was on the upper part of the ship. The situation on the Yangtze River is different from that on the open sea, and there is no strong wind and waves, so there is no great danger. The Bureau decided to order the Jiangshun to sail to Hankou as usual this morning. After unloading the cargo and passengers in Hankou, it will return to Shanghai, suspend operations, and enter the factory for major repairs. After the decision was made, the captain was notified to leave Shanghai for Hankou as usual this morning.</p>
<p>To Submit to Arbitration</p>
<p>After the accident, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, based on the Jiangshun's captain's report, reported to the Navigation Administration Bureau, the Jianghai Customs, and the Insurance Federation. Jardine Matheson also reported to the Customs and the Insurance Federation, which sent Chief Committee Member Xu Zufan, together with a technician from the Navigation Administration Bureau, to inspect the Jiangshun. Regarding the issue of responsibility, it is currently impossible to determine who is right and who is wrong. However, from the Jiangshun's perspective, it was sailing on the correct route, and the iron barge was coming head-on. The convention of navigation is to give way to the green light. This matter will be submitted to arbitration. The total loss is estimated at more than 10,000 yuan for the Jiangshun, and the sunk iron barge of Jardine Matheson is worth about 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Warning</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson iron barge sank in the river bottom more than 500 feet from the eleventh channel buoy. However, the barge's hull is extremely long, more than 180 feet, and has two masts. After it sank yesterday, the Jianghai Customs dispatched a sampan to moor at the sinking site with lights to warn ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River. Jardine Matheson believes that the barge's hull is excellent and extremely expensive to build. This time, it can still be salvaged, so it has decided to proceed with the salvage procedure.</p>

<h3>China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association Appoints Representatives to Petition the Government, Yesterday Jointly Issued a Declaration with Various Industrial and Commercial Organizations, Discussing Fundamental Relief Measures to be Submitted to the Authorities</h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association was initiated and organized by leading figures in the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors, including Wu Zhihao, Zhang Zilian, Chen Xiaodie, Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, and Zhang Rongchu. Since its establishment, it has extensively studied methods for relieving industry and commerce and has decided on various measures. To express its stance, it has drafted an important declaration, which will be jointly signed and published by various groups, factories, and stores in the city. The association's news from yesterday is summarized below.</p>
<p>Jointly Issue an Important Declaration</p>
<p>The important declaration drafted by the association will be jointly signed by various organizations and published in the advertising columns of various newspapers. The original text is excerpted below: "Declaration of the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association" Since the opening of maritime trade, our country has suffered long-term economic aggression by imperialist powers, leading to rural bankruptcy and the increasing peril of industry and commerce. Recently, countries around the world have been competitively devaluing currencies and expanding armaments. Tariff barriers are rising daily, and living standards are falling. Economies are increasingly subject to planned control, and politics are trending towards unlimited centralization of power. Under the siege of powerful nations, exacerbated by droughts and famines, rural bankruptcy is becoming increasingly acute, and the collapse of industry and commerce is worsening. Most recently, soaring silver prices and accumulated trade deficits have led to a massive outflow of silver and a financial panic reaching its peak. On the eve of the total collapse of national industry, we are at a moment of life and death for the national economy. The members of our association believe that the economy is the lifeblood of the nation, and Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce. In this critical moment, if we do not unite sincerely with our own strength and take effective measures to save the situation, the raging tide will be unstoppable, and the disasters will be unimaginable. Therefore, the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association was organized and established in Shanghai on March 2nd. First, we will address the urgent and volatile situation to seek immediate stability, and then aim to develop the national economy, promote industry, prosper commerce, and support the revival of agriculture. In addition to hiring experts to thoroughly study economic policies such as reforming the currency system, coordinating finance, controlling industries, and managing exchange rates, so that the strength, capital, and credit of products can circulate and cooperate with financial capital, we will submit proposals to the government and request their adoption and implementation. We hope that compatriots across the country will rise up in response, work together, be mindful of the national crisis, and jointly seek salvation, extending a lifeline for the nation and preserving the remaining vitality of the country. The nation will be fortunate, and our association will be fortunate. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>Appointed Representatives to Petition Separately</p>
<p>In order to promote the realization of the relief plan, the association has specially appointed several representatives to petition the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government today, as well as Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance and the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>Sent Letters to Two Organizations Requesting Support</p>
<p>The association yesterday sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association, saying: "Respectfully, since the tide of economic panic has swept the world, all countries have been affected. Now, due to the competition of tariff tactics and the oppression of silver policies, the tide of panic has been blocked and attacked our country under the illegal use of force. As a result, all industries and businesses have suffered major blows. Industrial and commercial organizations and comrades have united to initiate the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association, research methods, and jointly seek self-help. Your association is a leader in industry and commerce, and has an unshirkable responsibility to prevent and resolve difficulties. (Maintaining the locality, you have always had enthusiasm, and you must be deeply concerned about the prosperity and decline of Shanghai.) Therefore, we have enclosed two copies of the emergency plan for relieving industry and commerce, and we earnestly request that you convene a meeting to discuss and advise. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<p>Formed Two Committees to Study Methods</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the market, the association has divided the methods for relieving industry and commerce into two types: symptomatic and fundamental. In terms of symptomatic treatment, the two types of credit small loans and mortgaged loans for public assessment of products disclosed in yesterday's newspaper are emergency plans for temporarily relieving industry and commerce. As for fundamental relief methods, the association has decided to organize a National Economic Research Committee and an Advisory Committee to invite experts to study in detail in order to formulate a plan and suggest to the government to seek the full development of the national economy. According to the person in charge of the association, in the credit small loan mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, the word "above" in "all capital above 10,000 yuan" is a mistake for the word "below." A mistake of one word makes a big difference. The association specially sent a letter to various organizations yesterday to explain.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation to Relieve the Market Yesterday Notified Shops</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday, in order to relieve the market, specially produced an industrial and commercial economic survey form and distributed it to various district sub-associations. The district sub-associations distributed it to shops on various roads, filled in expenses, property, liabilities, the amount of relief needed, and so on in detail. After the survey forms are collected, the silver and money industry is required to provide sufficient relief to maintain the market and alleviate commercial difficulties. The association's notice is excerpted below. For the purpose of notification, it is found that the market has been sluggish, the economy has been exhausted, shops have closed, and factories have stopped work. Our association, as a citizen group, has also prepared considerable methods to provide relief, so as to reverse the decline and seek revival. In order to understand the past years of profit and loss of members' industries and businesses, a form is hereby attached, and we hope that you will seriously fill it out and send it to the association immediately for statistics and to facilitate relief.

<h3>The Financial Sector's Opinion on the Transaction Tax: Stable Revenue Will Not Be Abundant, But Commerce Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the issue of transaction tax collection is currently under review by the Legislative Yuan after various exchanges in Shanghai petitioned for an extension of the implementation period. The reporter believes that this matter is closely related to the domestic financial and industrial circles, so he specially visited a certain person familiar with finance, who agreed to express his opinions, which are divided into three points and are quite pertinent. They are recorded as follows: (1) It is said that collecting transaction tax can curb speculation, but whether the transactions of exchanges belong to speculation is the most important thing to pay attention to. The important task of exchanges is to adjust the market. The rise and fall of the market is based on need, or directly affected by international exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the gold exchange is purely an agency for adjusting the expansion and contraction of foreign exchange. Shanghai's foreign banks and Chinese banks that do foreign exchange all have telephone conversations with the exchange. The sharp drop in gold prices a few days ago was affected by the decline of the pound sterling. The pound sterling fell, and the gold price naturally plummeted, and the silver price naturally soared. Conversely, if the silver price falls, the gold price naturally rises. This is entirely due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, which cannot be controlled by the exchange, nor can it be manipulated by anyone. Moreover, when the gold price plummeted, cotton yarn also plummeted at the same time, indicating that the rise and fall of the market are interconnected, and speculation cannot make its tricks. This is the first thing to recognize about the nature of exchanges. (2) It is said that collecting transaction tax can achieve the goal of enriching the country's revenue, but enriching the country should first enrich the people. Now, the transactions of various exchanges in Shanghai are mostly affected by the global recession, and they are far from what they used to be. For example, the business of the gold exchange is gradually decreasing. Recently, without transactions, the daily transaction is no more than 100,000 taels at most, and only 20,000 taels at least. The profit of shareholders is distributed twice a year, totaling only 1.23%. In the future, there will be a more downward trend. The exchange takes 1.575 fen from the brokers for each tael. The transaction tax was initially set at 1 jiao per tael, exceeding the exchange's income by about 6.5 times. Its factual inability to bear it goes without saying. Even with the standard set by the current Legislative Yuan, 7 li per tael is about half of the exchange's income. If the exchange is responsible for the burden, it is too much. If it is added to the brokers, it will inevitably make the business more and more declining. The exchange itself cannot stand and then it is over. Moreover, the total amount of the 7 li transaction tax collected throughout the year, according to the current business, is only 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, which is insignificant compared to the revenue of the national treasury. Increasing the treasury revenue is very small, but it makes the exchange's life falter. This is worth considering. (3) The decline of the Shanghai market has reached its extreme today. Commerce is stagnant, factories are closed, foreign exchanges are soaring, land prices are falling, and empty houses in the downtown area are everywhere. Industry and commerce and the financial sector are urgently seeking the revival of the market, and the government is also encouraging and supporting it. The exchange is closely related to the financial and industrial circles, and pulling a hair can move the whole situation. If the exchange cannot support itself due to the tax issue, the market will naturally have a more adverse impact. Moreover, if the Chinese exchange cannot stand, it is tantamount to creating opportunities for foreign exchanges and night market exchanges. This is especially important to pay attention to. It is heard that the legislators came to Shanghai to investigate and collect facts for the transaction tax issue, and they were quite thorough in their translations. The result of the trial should leave a lifeline for the exchanges that adjust the market.</p>
<h3>Sassoon &amp; Co. to Close its Export Department, Import Department to Remain Open as Usual</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that Sassoon &amp; Co. has been engaged in business in China for a century, and now it will close its export department, while the import department will remain open as usual. According to the report, before the company was established 104 years ago, it started trading with China not long after it was established in India. Foreign yarn and opium were the main products imported into China. After the opium trade stopped, foreign yarn continued to be shipped and sold to China, and several new population products were added. In 1910, the company added an export department to ship Chinese products to foreign countries, and set up a branch in Hankou to handle everything. Now that the export department is about to be closed, the Hankou branch will also be closed. However, the company's business in Iraq and its neighboring countries and East Africa has been very developed in recent years. According to the report, the founder of Sassoon &amp; Co., David Sassoon, was born in Baghdad in 1792, and later served as the Prime Minister of Turkey. Around the age of 45, he went to Mumbai and became a British citizen.</p>

<p>Japanese envoy Arima Akira and Tang Youren left Beijing by overnight express train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Tan Zhen took the overnight train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Filipino Overseas Chinese Still Under American Protection, Yesterday's Report Was Not Yet the Time</h3>
<p>The Greater American Evening News reported, "Yesterday (7th), Judge Watson, the American local magistrate stationed in China, said that as a result of the Philippine Islands' independence movement, Filipino overseas Chinese in China are now under Chinese sovereignty." Today (8th), it was learned that it is not yet the time. Before Watson receives instructions from Washington to change the status of Filipino overseas Chinese, Filipino overseas Chinese in China will still be under the protection of the American consulate. According to Watson, yesterday's report was slightly misunderstood, but once the Philippines becomes a republic, the relationship between the Philippines and China will obviously be a matter between the two countries, and it will have nothing to do with the United States. The Filipino overseas Chinese in this city were panicked after reading the report yesterday, and decided to hold a meeting tomorrow at the office of Filipino Silo Veleso at 123 Yuanmingyuan Road, and have asked Mr. Veleso to lead the electricity to the American government to formally declare that Filipinos are still under American protection and that their status remains unchanged. Although the passports issued to non-people are still in the American way, the passport holders are already called citizens of the Philippines. Filipinos who go to the United States must comply with the American immigration restrictions and must obtain an entry passport from the American consulate. This can legally cause disputes over the status of Filipino overseas Chinese, so they are quite uneasy. However, they believe that although the United States will pass a bill to allow the independence of the Philippines, it is not yet possible to be sure that they can be independent. Before independence becomes a reality, they should still be under the protection of the United States.</p>
<h3>Xu Tingyao Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>

As for Xu Tingyao and his party of twenty-two from the Military Group, they returned home by the Italian Lines' Conte Rosso. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 3:30 pm today and will dock at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong.

Yu Feipeng will also arrive in Shanghai from Beijing this morning to greet them. It is also learned that after Xu and others arrive in Shanghai, they will stay briefly and then go to Sichuan to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang and report on the inspection.</p>

<h3>Movie Star Ruan Lingyu Commits Suicide, Taking as Many as Three Bottles of Tranquilizer Pills, Dies at 6 PM Last Night After Ineffective Treatment — Jade Shatters, Star Falls, Person Dies, Image Remains —</h3>
<p>Ruan Lingyu, a famous Chinese movie star, has recently been sued by her ex-husband Zhang Damin, which has deeply stimulated her. She suddenly felt tired of the world at about 3 am yesterday morning and secretly took three bottles of tranquilizer pills at her private residence to commit suicide. Her husband, Tang Jishan, discovered this and immediately took her to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. However, there was no doctor on the night shift at the hospital, which delayed the treatment for one or two hours. Later, she was sent to Dr. Zou for treatment, which lasted for six or seven hours, but there was no progress. At about 9 am, Drs. Chen Daming and Chen Jiyao from the China Sanitarium on Route Ghisi were invited to provide treatment. At the same time, she was sent to the Chinese and Western Sanitarium on Rue Petain, where doctors performed emergency treatments several times. Although she had been slightly conscious several times, she eventually died at 6:30 pm due to severe poisoning. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Past Affairs of Musket Shadow, Unforgettable Pain</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu is 26 years old and a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. Her father died early, and her family was poor. She lived in Shanghai with her mother since she was a child. Her mother used her income from helping out to support her to study at Chongde Girls' School. At the age of seventeen, she fell in love with Zhang Damin and lived together outside. She first entered the film industry ten years ago, but she was not very popular. In 1930, the Lianhua Company rose in South China and won over outstanding film practitioners in China, producing and showing "Wild Flowers by the Road", with Ruan as the lead actress. She became an instant sensation and won domestic praise. Zhang Damin worked at the Ruian Wheel of the Steamship Company, but later Zhang and the company were not in harmony. Xie negotiated a divorce. Ruan then cohabited with Tang Jishan, a giant merchant in the tea business. Both sides were originally fine, but recently, Zhang suddenly filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court accusing Ruan Lingyu of embezzlement, and also filed a lawsuit in the District Court accusing Tang Jishan and Ruan Lingyu of disrupting the family. Public opinion was not without subtle words about Ruan. Ruan looked back on the past and could not help but feel melancholy, and her name was once again registered in the books, making her even more unhappy. As soon as the stimulation was born, she had short ideas.</p>
<p>Lonely Night, Unexpectedly Short-sighted</p>
<p>Ruan had been unhappy for many days because of the lawsuit, and her heart was often depressed, and she was uneasy even when she was sleeping. To the night before, Ruan recalled the past and tossed and turned, unable to sleep. At 7 am yesterday morning, she suddenly had short ideas, so she took advantage of her husband, Tang Jishan, unpreparedness, and took tranquilizer pills to commit suicide, taking as many as three bottles, which was a very large amount. At that time, Ruan still did not say anything to people, and then Ruan's snoring was very loud, and she fell into a deep sleep, but her face suddenly changed drastically. So, her husband, Tang Jishan, discovered it and immediately telegraphed to ask three Western doctors, Chen Jiyao, etc., to go to the clinic one after another. But because she was poisoned too much, she had to undergo a major operation, so she was sent to the Jinxi Sanitarium in a car for treatment.</p>
<p>Star Mang Dies, Jade Fails and Fragrant Disappears</p>
<p>At 11 am yesterday, Ruan was in her house on Gordon Road, accompanied by Tang Jishan and three doctors, took a car to Jinxi Sanitarium on West Petain Road for treatment. The car galloped, and the fragrant body groaned, and Tang Jishan and others in the car frequently called her name, but Ruan at this time could not speak, and was only a dumb beauty. At 11:10, she arrived at the sanitarium, entered room 205, and three doctors, Chen Jiyao, etc., and Western doctors from the sanitarium resumed consultation to provide treatment together, but because the amount of poison was too much, the condition did not improve. At noon, Ruan's pulse was only a breath. Many, had entered a dying state, so the doctors read to inject grab gas, and to give injections, save this dangerous state, Ruan is good, to two and a half hours later, Ruan turned into a dangerous state again, when Tang Jishan's mother, and Lianhua company star Lin Chuchu, etc., all went to visit, frequently calling her name, and Ruan could not speak, knowing that she had lost consciousness, and breathing was also short, and after the doctor injected gas, the condition improved slightly, but to six hours, suddenly turned into a dramatic situation, the doctors tried to maintain, and finally the return to spring was lacking, and the medicine stone was ineffective, and it was delayed until 6:38, Ruan was out of breath, from then on, a wisp of fragrant Gui, actually returned to the underground.</p>
<p>A Glance at the End, The Desolation of the World</p>
<p>After the reporter heard the news at 6 pm yesterday, he immediately went to visit, and Ruan had entered a dying state, with only a thread of air, and soon died. When Ruan was dying, he could not speak, and looked at Tang Jishan and Tang's mother, his friend Lin Chuchu and other people and doctors such as Chen Jiyao, etc., all waiting by the side, sighing frequently, and dropping tears for it, and Tang and Tang's mother, crying even more sadly, sadly wanted to die, at that time, the situation, the witnesses all regretted it, and did not intend to be a new woman in the tragedy of Ruan Lingyu actually practiced it, but also people expected less.</p>
<p>Funeral Home, Great Farewell Today</p>
<p>Ruan's body, at 8 pm last night, was sent to the International Funeral Home on Haig Road, and it is now scheduled to be a great farewell today, Tang Jishan was almost fainted because of too much sorrow, today will be taken care of by his friends Funeral Lianhua female stars and other personnel, will be going to help, Fang Xing Millennium, jade Xu Xiangxiao, only make future generations in the silver screen, a glimpse of this voice and appearance, is enough to be sad,</p>
<p>Just Dancing Wildly at the Yangtze the Night Before</p>
<p>According to further inquiries, Ruan was still dancing wildly with several male guests at the Yangtze Hotel at 11 pm the day before yesterday (6th), and there were many witnesses at the time, which was very noticeable. Everyone thought that Ruan was indulging in the lights and wine, and at first did not know that she actually committed suicide yesterday, which is also enough to see the impermanence of personnel. In addition, Ruan starred in many films at Lianhua, and recently, after Ruan's new female film, Lianhua continued to perform two films, one is "National Customs" and the other is "Spring Comes to the World", and both films have not been completed. After Ruan's death, these two films may be terminated, which is also a loss for Lianhua.</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu's Legacy</p>
<h3>A Public Bus Accident, A Five-Year-Old Boy Died on the Spot, An Old Woman and A Girl Were Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinsheng, the driver of the Shanghai South Public Bus No. 89, a native of Hubei, drove a passenger car with the number "10013" from Old West Gate to Longhua. At 6:20 the night before, he drove through the entrance of Dexingli Lane on Nan City Manufacturing Bureau Road. Suddenly, Miao Huishi, an old woman from Nanjing who lived at No. 11 in the lane, brought her five-year-old grandson Cheng Maotou, and Wan Adi, a girl from Henan who lived at No. 28 in the lane next door, while buying water chestnuts on the sugarcane beach opposite Dexingli, the driver Zhao Jinsheng avoided a girl, causing the car to twist slightly, and failed to brake in time, knocking down Miao Caoshi and the two children, and immediately unconscious. The wheels crushed the heads and legs of the old woman and Wan Adi and Cheng Maotou, with blood flowing. The police officer Lu Jinlong from the 48th post of the Huining Road Police Station of the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau saw it, and immediately intercepted the car driver Zhao Jinsheng and took him to the station for detention. At the same time, the injured Miao Caoshi and the girl Wan Adi were rushed to the nearby Bo Deli Hospital for treatment, and the injuries were not serious, and there was no worry about their lives. However, the boy Cheng Maotou died on the spot due to severe injuries and excessive bleeding. The police chief Wang Shouhe believed that the case was related to human life, so he escorted the car driver Zhao Jinsheng to the West Gate Branch. After the director Li Jing questioned the plaintiff and the defendant, he ordered to escort the case to the General Bureau for transfer to the District Court for handling.</p>
<h3>Hu Changbiao, A Twice Jailbreaker in Jiading, Was Arrested and Has Been Escorted Back to the Jiading County Government for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Hu Changbiao, a notorious robber from Funing, had previously committed serious crimes of temple robbery within the jurisdiction of Jiading County. He was arrested by the county government and sentenced to life imprisonment. Later, he was granted amnesty and his sentence was reduced to 15 years of imprisonment. When the January 28 Shanghai War broke out, Jiading was also involved in the war. Hu took the opportunity to escape from prison. The county government issued an arrest warrant. However, the criminal hid in Shanghai and committed another theft, and was arrested. After the county government found out, it sent a detective to Shanghai to escort him back to prison for execution. However, the criminal was unruly, and on the evening of the 1st of this month, he escaped from prison for the second time while the prison guards were changing shifts, and sneaked into Shanghai. The Public Security Bureau of the county secretly sent detectives to Shanghai to investigate. On the 3rd of this month, the criminal was walking at the intersection of Beijing Road on the Bund of the Public Concession. He was bumped into by the detective police, and the criminal Hu was taken into the police station and sent to the court the next day. After interrogation, it was found that Hu was a two-time escaped prisoner in Jiading. He was ordered to hand him over to the detective police to take him back for interrogation. Therefore, the criminal Hu was escorted by the detective police by the Beijing-Shanghai Express to Nanxiang the day before yesterday, changed to a rickshaw and escorted back to the Jiading County Government for legal interrogation.</p>
<h3>Demanding Meeting Fees, Committing Murder by Assault, Heirs Seek Compensation and Funeral Expenses, Trial Concludes Yesterday, Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Tian Heqing from Tongzhou, who made a living pulling a rickshaw, resided at No. 23, Shijia Lane, Xuejiabang, Nanshi. His wife, Zhu, farmed in their hometown. On the evening of the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month of the previous year, Chen Sanshun, also from Tongzhou, came to Tian's place, demanding meeting fees from Tian Heqing but failing to obtain them, leading to an argument. This escalated into a physical altercation, with Chen Sanshun violently striking Tian Heqing's right cheek. Neighbors, including Zhang Yuan, intervened and separated them. The next morning, around 4 a.m., Tian Heqing suddenly died. The local police station was notified, and immediately instructed the local constable to report the matter to the court for investigation. The suspect, Chen Sanshun, was apprehended and handed over to the local court, where Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia interrogated and detained him. Simultaneously, Tian Heqing's body was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy. The examination revealed that the deceased had suffered an injury behind his right ear, causing a concussion of the cerebral blood vessels, leading to his death. Prosecutor Zhao, after a clear investigation, prosecuted the case in the criminal court on charges of assault leading to death. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., Judge Guan Liting specially opened the tenth court for the trial. The plaintiff, Tian Zhu, accompanied by her private prosecutor's lawyer, Gong Chuyin, attended the court. The defendant, Chen Sanshun, also retained a lawyer for his defense. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the imprisoned Chen Sanshun, 33 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 4, Dexing Lane, Laiyi Wharf, making a living pulling a rickshaw, to be brought to the stand for questioning. Asked, "Why did you beat Tian Heqing to death?" He replied, "I did not beat him." Asked, "Why did you quarrel with Tian Heqing?" He replied, "Because Tian Heqing owed me 36 yuan in meeting fees, and I repeatedly asked for it but he kept delaying. The last time, he promised to return it on December 26th, but when the date arrived, he still didn't pay. So on the evening of the 27th, I went to Tian's place again to ask for it, but he ignored me. I merely pointed at him with my finger," and so on. Next, witness Zhang Yuan, 53 years old, residing at No. 23, Shijia Lane, Xuejiabang, testified. Asked, "What is your relationship with Tian Heqing?" She replied, "Neighbor." Asked, "Do you know about the fight over debt collection?" She replied, "Tian Heqing owed Chen Sanshun ten yuan in meeting money, and had already returned five yuan, still owing five yuan. Because he had no money to return, an argument arose. Chen Sanshun, in anger, punched him. At that time, Heqing leaned on the table and cried. Chen Sanshun left when he saw me trying to mediate. Afterwards, I helped Tian Heqing upstairs to sleep. The next morning, around 4 a.m., I called him to get up for work, but he didn't respond no matter how many times I called. I was very surprised, so I immediately went upstairs to check and saw that Tian Heqing had already died," and so on. Then, Tian Zhu, 25 years old, from Tongzhou, testified. Tian Heqing is my husband. Asked, "How did your husband die?" She replied, "He was beaten to death by Chen Sanshun." Asked, "Do you live with your husband?" She replied, "I live in Tongzhou." Asked, "How did you know?" She replied, "I only found out after receiving a letter from relatives." Asked, "What is your request now?" She replied, "I depend on my husband for a living. Now that he has been beaten to death by Chen Sanshun, I ask the court to seek justice for my husband." At this point, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia arrived in court, delivered his statement, and the arguments began. The lawyer retained by the defendant, Chen Sanshun, rose to defend him at length, requesting a verdict of not guilty. Subsequently, Lawyer Gong rose and stated his request for compensation for funeral expenses, burial costs, and other fees, totaling 2,480 yuan. The judge, having heard the evidence, deemed the case concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 10 a.m. on the 13th of this month. The defendant, Chen Sanshun, was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministries of Communications and Industry, Requesting Opening of Central and Southern Shipping Routes, National Products Must Have Their Own Shipping Routes to Promote Overseas Sales</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministries of Communications and Industry, saying, (condensed greeting) The Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, in order to promote national products overseas, sent personnel back to China in November of last year to collect samples of national products from various places to hold an exhibition. The results of the negotiations were quite satisfactory. According to a letter from the Chamber, it has been decided that the exhibition will be held from July 6 to 13 of this year, and may be extended if necessary. However, the purpose of setting up the exhibition is to open up overseas markets, and it is necessary to keep prices low in order to maintain permanence. Therefore, the Chamber has proposed that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company open up central and southern shipping routes to expedite the transport of goods to various ports, and to reduce the cost of transportation during the Chamber's exhibition. In February of this year, the Chamber sent a direct appeal to Your Ministry, requesting that it be forwarded for handling. Recently, the Chamber sent a copy of the appeal, requesting that it be supported. It is necessary to open up shipping routes in order to expedite transport as much as possible and to keep costs low. This is a certain and easy principle to win the market. In the past, when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was under the official supervision of the Northern Ocean, it originally opened up several overseas shipping routes. After the Sino-Japanese War, it gradually declined. The bureau still owes debts, and its plans seem difficult to reach far. However, the bureau originally had shipping routes to Hong Kong, and has recently added several new ships. Singapore is a tax-free port and a metropolis where overseas Chinese gather. No less than hundreds of thousands of people reside there, and the number of freight and passenger transportations should be considerable. It seems not difficult to extend the bureau's ships sailing to Hong Kong to Singapore. Even if foreign ships reduce prices to compete at the beginning of the opening of the shipping route, the overseas Chinese will definitely encourage their compatriots to take domestic ships because it is at the request of the overseas Chinese, and they will never abandon this and go for that. Even if there are losses in the initial operation due to competitive price reductions, can the government temporarily subsidize it to consolidate the foundation? After the foundation is laid, it will not be needed, and it will not be a burden on public funds forever. It is not enough to appease the overseas Chinese and expand sales without weighing the pros and cons. It is reasonable to submit this report based on the facts. We respectfully request Your Ministry to examine it and act as requested, which is for the public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Yang.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Restrictions on Rice Imports, Municipal Government Representative Returns to Shanghai, Mr. Wu Discusses Different Opinions in Three Points, Requesting Discussion at Next Week's Executive Yuan Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the issue of restricting rice imports, the Municipal Government has drafted its opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval so that they can be followed. On the morning of the 7th, the Executive Yuan specially convened the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Interior, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government, to hold a review meeting. Mr. Wu Huanru, the representative sent by Shanghai, left Shanghai for Beijing on the 6th to participate in the meeting and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him and asked about the progress of the discussion on this case. According to him,</p>
<p>Scope of Discussion. According to Mr. Wu, the city has submitted their views to the Executive Yuan for instructions regarding the unrestricted rice imports, fearing it may affect the domestic rice market. On the 7th, the Executive Yuan in Beijing convened the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Interior, as well as the Rural Reconstruction Committee and representatives from the Municipal Government to discuss the measures. The representatives believed that the amount of imported rice exceeding the needed quantity should be seriously researched. The rice merchants who ordered imported rice leading to the outflow of cash is of great importance to the entire industry and commerce, so it should be paid close attention to. The problem of broken rice is taxed at only half the rate, which leads to increased imports, severely impacting the sales of domestic rice. All of these were the scope of the discussion.</p>
<p>Different Opinions. After the discussion, the opinions were roughly divided into three points: First, the impact of rice imports on various businesses, currently the Ministry of Finance and other departments are researching ways to assist industry and commerce, which can be incorporated into this case for handling. Second, whether it is necessary to increase the collection of rice tax will be discussed in another case, and a decision will be made based on the situation. Third, whether the broken rice problem should be taxed in full should be submitted to the National Tariff Commission for review and decision.</p>
<p>Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Discussion. The results of the discussion will be submitted to the Executive Yuan's regular meeting next week for discussion. However, rice imports are related to the prosperity and decline of our country's rural economy and a fundamental solution is needed. In the current situation in our country, the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the downturn of industry and commerce cannot be effective without concrete ways to solve the problem. The central authorities have witnessed this situation, so they are already working on fundamental relief measures, and concrete decisions will be made soon.</p>

<h3>Hongshan Temple Monk Sues Yuanzhao for Encroaching on Temple Property</h3>
<p>Yuanzhao, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, was found to have sold the property of Longhua Temple and infringed on the property of Hongshan Temple, west of Dananmen. The local court investigated the case and sentenced Yuanzhao to imprisonment for two years and a fine of 6,000 yuan for both crimes. The details have been reported many times in the previous newspapers. It is now known that Minfeng, a monk of Hongshan Temple, again filed a criminal lawsuit in the local court against Yan Wanglong, Yuanzhao's nephew-in-law, and Yuanzhao for colluding to encroach on temple property and unauthorizedly rebuilt the temple base into municipal houses for rent, with monthly rental income of more than 900 yuan, which they shared. Judge He Qinzhi summoned Yan to court, issued an arrest warrant, and ordered Yan Wanglong to hand over the operating license of Hongshan Temple. According to Yan's confession, this land was owned by his family and the operating license was pledged to Xinhua Bank for 5,000 yuan, so he was unable to hand it over. In fact, this land base is a total of two square sheets, which are 21 Hongzi Wei in 25 Bao, later changed to an operating license. The registered owner is Ling Guyu and Ling Yunyuan. The documents are stored in a safe deposit box rented from the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank by Yuanzhao. According to the bank's regulations, to withdraw the deposits in the safe deposit box, the photos must be verified. Therefore, Yan Wanglong could not hand them over. It is found that the factory director of Jinshan Cigarette Factory at Xieqiao is Yan Wanglong, the accounting director is Yan Wangsheng, and the manager is Ling Yunyuan. The registered name of the cigarette industry association is also Ling Yunyuan (the three words "Ling Yunyuan" are actually Yuanzhao's pseudonym). The day before yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Li ordered Minfeng to be summoned to court and questioned Yan Wanglong, who was in custody, for a long time. The case was deemed unusually complicated and will be investigated. Yan was ordered to return to prison.</p>
<h3>Traveler Commits Suicide in Changzhou Hotel</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, at about 8:00 PM, a young man arrived at the Changzhou Hotel at No. 2, Ningkang Lane, North Zhejiang Road. He opened room No. 27 and registered his name as Li Qinbo, 22 years old, from Jiaxing, and closed the door and went to bed. He secretly swallowed sleeping pills to commit suicide. It was not until about 8:00 AM the next morning that the waiter Zhang Xida discovered the incident and immediately reported it to the Huisi Police Station, who ordered Detective Ji Xiuquan to investigate. They immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was transported to the Philippine Road autopsy center, and four bottles of sleeping pills were found beside him, 28 of which had been eaten. A savings passbook from the Continental Bank was also found, registered to Zhang Guoting, with only one yuan left. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the center to confirm the identity of the body. He then announced that the deceased, Li Qinbo, male, had indeed died from taking sleeping pills. Since no relatives were found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Partnership to Operate Salt Business; Lawsuit Filed for Fraud After Losses</h3>
<p>Cheng Ruiren filed a lawsuit with the French Concession police on February 28, accusing Tu Xingsheng (from Changzhou, residing at No. 2, Furen Lane, Connaught Road) and Wang Yongqing (from Wuxi, residing at No. 89, Shaonian Road, Chinese Territory) of fraudulently obtaining property. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Tu and Wang and escort them to the Second Special District Court. Following interrogation, the court ordered Tu and Wang to post bail pending further investigation. During a subsequent hearing yesterday, the plaintiff stated that in September of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the two defendants approached him, claiming they wanted to partner with Yang Yishan to invest 20,000 yuan in establishing the Yixing Salt Business in Bengbu. Lacking sufficient capital, they urged him to contribute 2,000 taels, promising substantial profits. The merchant, temporarily deceived, entrusted the money to Wang Yongqing for transfer to Tu Xingsheng. Unexpectedly, after the payment, they disappeared without a trace for several years. Only recently did the plaintiff encounter the defendants and inquire about the salt business's operations. They allegedly said it had suffered complete losses. Under such circumstances, it was clear that a fraudulent act had occurred, and the plaintiff requested an investigation and the recovery of the funds, etc. Tu Xingsheng testified that Yang Yishan, Ma Huchen, and others established a salt business in Bengbu but lacked capital, seeking 10,000 yuan from merchants. Yang contributed 10,000 yuan, forming a capital of 20,000 yuan. Consequently, he recruited the plaintiff to contribute 2,000 taels, a Mr. Someone also contributed 2,000 taels, and he personally contributed 6,000 taels, amounting to 10,000 taels, which was delivered to Yang Yishan to start the business. The merchant entrusted Wang Yongqing to go to Bengbu for supervision, and indeed saw 20,000 dan of salt. They waited for the next year to sell it, but unexpectedly suffered from Communist bandits and a flood, causing the complete loss of capital. He wanted to negotiate with Yang Yishan, but Yang also avoided meeting him. Moreover, the plaintiff was present when the money was handed over to Yang Yishan. The merchant was also a victim and would not dare to commit fraud. He had also been meeting with the merchant so why would he have run away. Wang Yongqing testified that the merchant had no connection to the case. He was asked by both parties to go to Bengbu as a witness. The plaintiff should not have accused the merchant. His remaining testimony was consistent with Tu's. Wang Shizong, a lawyer, provided legal defense. Judge Qiu Huan examined the testimonies and announced the conclusion of the hearing, setting a sentencing date for the 12th. The defendants were to remain under their original bail.</p>

His eldest son, Wang Yutang, is 18 years old and an apprentice at a department store at the intersection of Zilai Street and Avenue Edward VII. Unexpectedly, Yutang, instead of striving for progress, secretly stole 35 yuan in cash and 90 jiao in small change from the store on the 25th of last month and fled. After spending all the money wandering, he dared not return to the store or home, becoming a vagrant, enduring hardship, hunger, and cold. Regretting his actions, he had a moment of despair. On the evening of the 7th, he pawned his clothes, bought raw opium, used the alias Zhang Laigen, and checked into a room at the Xinkang Inn at the entrance of the Mill Lane on Avenue de la Republique in the French Concession. The inn saw that his appearance was unkempt and refused him lodging. He then went to the nearby Changfa Inn at No. 309, checked into Room 11 under the pretext of needing a place to stay, paid the room fee, and then closed the door to sleep and ingested raw opium to commit suicide without waiting for the room service to bring him water for washing. At 8:00 AM yesterday, the room service attendant, Dong Axiao, knocked on the door to empty the chamber pot, but received no response after calling for a long time. He pried open the door and entered, finding Yutang already dead in bed, with traces of raw opium nearby, as well as a letter from his deceased father and five pawn tickets. The inn reported the matter to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was moved to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. The detectives, according to the address written on the letter's envelope, notified his father to come and identify the body, awaiting the court's dispatch of personnel today for an official examination.</p>
<h3>Robber Sentenced to Seven Years in Prison</h3>

The perpetrators fled in a rush. The Hongkou police arrested one of the robbers, Wang Yufa from Jiangbei, who was escorted to the First Special District Court. He confessed that Lin Jiaqai had initiated the plan, and Old Wang invited him to keep watch near Qiu's house. He received 1.40 yuan after the robbery. He was ordered to be detained pending sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Wang Yufa to seven years in prison.

<h3>Robbers Arrested Before Committing the Act</h3>

They secretly went to the location with Western detectives and waited. After a while, Yang Jinlong, Jiang Jinlian, and Su Zhou Dayu Yongsheng, all from Jiangbei, staggered toward the residence. They were arrested, and a handgun with eight bullets was found on Yang. Interrogation revealed that Hu Fuchan from Shaoxing, Dai Yonglin from Yancheng, and Huang Hancheng were accomplices at the Changzhou Hotel at No. 21 on North Zhejiang Road and other locations. Chinese and Western detectives then rushed to those addresses and apprehended the other three, bringing them all to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, detailed the events and requested an extension. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the case's progress and presented the handgun and bullets for inspection. Yang Jinlong confessed that Dai Yonglin had given him the handgun at the Changzhou Hotel, telling him that Wu San, who was at large, was instructing him to "work" on Qipu Road. Jiang Jinlian and Yu Yongsheng confessed that Wu had invited them to "fight." Hu Fuchan confessed that Wu San and Dai Yonglin had instructed him to go to the Changzhou Hotel. The rest stammered in their confessions. Dai Yonglin admitted that Yang Jinlong, Huang Hancheng, and Wu San were all under his care. Huang Hancheng said that he met a Mr. Yang from Guangdong at Room 318 of the Shanghai Hotel, who said that the Tang family at No. 19 Baoqing Lane, Qipu Road, had valuable gold jewelry and diamond rings that could be stolen. He then informed "Big Red" (i.e., Dai Yonglin) to gather a gang and carry out the plan, etc. Judge Wu Zehan ruled that they would remain in custody pending further investigation and a later date.</p>

Then, Cao Guicheng received support from the rear, broke through two defenses in succession, advanced straight ahead, and dribbled the ball close to the goal. Shi Dulanqi rushed to catch up. Seeing the situation was not good, Cao immediately passed the ball to Ye Beihua, who lifted his foot to shoot, but it hit Jin Bulu's leg, bounced back out. Beihua steadied the ball and attacked again. Luo Zha finally watched the ball enter the net. At that time, cheers resounded from all around, all congratulating South China. After South China took the lead, the Hong Kong Club players inevitably became timid, and their formation was greatly disrupted. Tan Jiangbai dribbled the ball straight forward from the center line. Jin Bulu was greatly frightened and dribbled the ball all the way out of bounds by himself, resulting in a corner kick. Ye Beihua took the kick, and Tan Jiangbai headed the ball towards the goal, but it was saved by Vega. Guicheng took another corner kick, and the force was also excellent. The forwards of South China took the opportunity to surround Hong Kong Club. However, Huang Meishun shot from about three yards in front of the goal, but it hit Luo Zha's foot and bounced back out. Later, Hou Huo gained possession of the ball in a hard-fought battle and passed it to Bi Fu, who quickly made a move to score, but it was caught by Huang Jiliang. Not long after, Liang Rongzhao chose to take an out-of-bounds ball, and Jiangbai responded from the outside, but the shot hit the goalpost again, and there was still no gain. Otherwise, South China would have already won three goals at this time. After a while, the referee blew his whistle, and the first half ended.</p>
<p>Second Half: Concedes Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After the break, the match continued. South China attacked repeatedly but failed to score, and was calculated by Hong Kong Club. First, Hou Huo passed Liu Qingcai's defense line and passed the ball to Xilu, who lifted his foot to shoot. Jiliang abandoned the goal to save the ball, but Hou Huo managed to head the ball into the empty goal, making it a 1-1 draw. Guicheng planned to quickly catch up and break through, passing the ball to the middle. Jiangbai then passed the ball with his head to Beihua, who headed the ball again, but it flew high over the boundary and still gained nothing. Then, Li Tiansheng was positioned too far forward, and the defense was empty. Hou Huo attacked again, dribbling the ball forward. Jiliang dared not move out lightly, so Hou Huo rushed forward and kicked the ball into the net. Not long after, Rongzhao saw that Robertson was coming too fiercely and bravely came out to intercept, but was ruled to have committed a foul. Robertson took the opportunity to kick the ball towards the goal. Under a tight siege, Fula rushed to the ball and shot it into the net. Liang Xianzhan rushed back to defend, but it was too late. At this point, there was not much time left until the end of the match. Although South China worked hard to attack, they were unable to turn the tide and suffered a crushing defeat with a score of 1-3. They also lost any hope of winning the special silver shield competition this year.</p>

The distribution of funds is specified in detail.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Municipal Government Implements Universal Education</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th dispatch) Illiteracy in Tianjin accounts for 50 to 60 percent. The municipal government has decided to implement universal education and has ordered the Education Bureau to formulate a plan, which has been approved by the municipal council. In addition to the original 60,000 yuan per month, an additional 15,000 yuan has been added to provide assistance. The old urban area is limited to three years, and the new urban area is limited to eight years to complete.</p>
<h3>Hubei Education Department Opens Expert Conference; Cheng Qibao Proposes Seven Major Issues for Discussion; Tao Xingzhi, Liu Zhanen, and Others Appointed to Draft Plans</h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) In order to thoroughly improve education in Hubei Province, the Education Department invited national experts and scholars to Hubei to hold a round table conference. Those who accepted the invitation include Niu Yongjian, Jiang Wenyu, Dong Renjian, Liu Zhanen, Tao Xingzhi, Ai Wei, and many others. The conference is scheduled to open on the 7th, and a preparatory meeting was held on the 6th. Cheng Qibao, the director of the Education Department, reported on the difficulties of education in the province and expressed a warm welcome and sincere gratitude to the experts for their arrival. He hoped that everyone would express their opinions, solve all the difficulties, and indicate new paths. On that day, they were divided into two groups to visit provincial schools. At 9:00 AM on the 7th, the discussion conference officially opened in the memorial hall of the Education Department. Cheng Qibao proposed the following issues for discussion: (1) Regarding vocational education, this department must meet the vocational education standards set by the Ministry of Education by 1937. How should it be designed and implemented? (2) Regarding universal education, universal education in this province is extremely backward, and the development trend favors towns while neglecting rural areas. What is the most economical, simplest, and most applicable method to achieve universal national education in the shortest possible time? (3) Regarding mass education, in recent years, mass education in China, except for a few experimental areas, has shown some results, and all kinds are only formalistic and impractical. What methods should be adopted in the future to ensure that mass education work can make a contribution? (4) Regarding the reorganization of middle schools, the establishment and distribution of secondary schools in this province are often inappropriate, resulting in a lot of waste in terms of economy, and the development of culture in the province is also unbalanced. How should it be reorganized to remedy this? (5) Regarding the middle school curriculum and teaching, 1. The current middle school curriculum seems to be heavy, and the distribution also has room for discussion, such as insufficient Chinese language, too little natural science, and whether foreign languages should exist, etc., all need to be discussed. 2. At present, general middle schools have no teaching methods, and many textbooks are also inapplicable. Therefore, students lack the ability to learn independently and the organization system for learning even after several years of training. How should the above two malpractices be remedied? (6) Regarding special education, special education is aimed at recovering bandit areas, with education, support, and defense as the goal, and combines family education, social education, and school education. How should its theory be enriched and its implementation promoted? (7) Regarding normal education, normal schools and middle schools should each have a special spirit, but today, it is difficult to distinguish between running normal education and middle school education. How should this be corrected? Should normal students be graduates of junior high schools? In order to reduce the government's burden and speed up training in the future, and to provide relief to senior high school graduates, is it possible to accept senior high school graduates and give them one year of training, and impart the necessary knowledge and skills in education? Senior high school graduates have a higher level of science than normal students. With one year of training in educational science, their results may be better than those of normal students for three years. On the first day, due to time constraints, only the implementation methods of universal literacy education and mass basic education were discussed. Each expert had their own opinions. Finally, Tao Xingzhi, Yin Yuanzhu, Wang Yizhou, and Xiang Xinkui were appointed to draft a plan for universal education, and Liu Zhanen, Jiang Qi, Wang Yizhou, and Zhang Shiguan were appointed to draft a plan for mass education, to be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. In the afternoon, the experts gave lectures in several places. From 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, general lectures were held at the provincial party headquarters. Niu Yongjian spoke on "Military National Education," and Liu Zhanen spoke on "Reviving the Nation and Civic Education." At 5:00 PM, special lectures were held. The academic group held a meeting at the provincial party headquarters, where Ai Wei spoke on "Comparative Research on the Results of the Literary and Vernacular Experiment in the Past Ten Years." The vocational group held a meeting at the Youth Association, where Jiang Wenyu spoke on "Vocational Problems." The mass education and rural construction group held a meeting at the provincial senior high school, where Tao Xingzhi spoke on "Mass Education and Rural Construction Issues." The conference will last for five days and will be held once a day. It is scheduled to close on the 11th. (7th)</p>

<h3>Methods for Protecting Eardrums</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>—Attention users of earphones—</p>
<p>This publication has repeatedly described methods for protecting the diaphragms in earphones. However, methods for protecting the diaphragms inside the ears have never been discussed!</p>
<p>In fact, if the diaphragm of an earphone is damaged, it is easy to repair. However, if the diaphragm inside the ear is injured by excessive sound waves, it will become a lifelong regret!</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of new-style AC radios, earphones seem to have become obsolete. However, in the following situations, using earphones to receive broadcasts is still very necessary:</p>
<p>(1) When it is late at night and one wants to avoid disturbing cohabitants or neighbors.</p>
<p>(2) When amateur enthusiasts are testing the performance of radios.</p>
<p>(3) When receiving broadcasts from distant locations.</p>
<p>Of the above three points, the last one is the most important. Because broadcasts from distant locations have extremely weak power, sometimes a very clear sound can be obtained in the earphones, but in the loudspeaker, there is no signal to be heard. Receiving broadcasts from distant locations with earphones is something that all distant-location radio enthusiasts (DX fans) cannot avoid.</p>
<p>The weakness of radio waves from distant stations has been mentioned above. Therefore, even when using earphones, the volume control must be turned to the highest point. In this way, there is a high possibility of danger occurring. Because although the radio waves sent from distant locations are very weak, the interference from nearby radio waves and various man-made static disturbances will still be rampant as before. If they suddenly take the opportunity to intrude, to what extent will the sound waves emitted from the earphones be? The author once used a four-tube shortwave radio to receive broadcasts from the WOXE radio station in New York, USA, at night using earphones (frequency 15270 KC). While dancing and getting carried away, I didn't expect that there was also a radio enthusiast nearby who was also tuning to a frequency close to mine. At that time, the two frequencies mixed and generated a frequency difference, and a loud screaming sound was heard in the earphones. I immediately put down the earphones, but my eardrum had been greatly damaged, and it took a full five minutes to recover my hearing. Fortunately, I was using a DC radio with lower power. If it had been a powerful one with several watts of output, the consequences would have been unimaginable! (Someone once used two -45 vacuum tubes connected in a push-pull amplifier to listen to broadcasts from the Central Radio Station in Beijing. As a result, the glass window behind the loudspeaker was shattered by the vibration. The greatness of AC power can be imagined.)</p>
<p>After this accident, I couldn't help but feel fear towards earphones. However, giving up eating because of choking is not a good idea. Therefore, I came up with many preventive measures, which I will now write down one by one, hoping that my fellow enthusiasts will give me guidance.</p>
<p>(1) Connect a 500,000-ohm variable resistor in parallel with the earphones. When unexpected interference is encountered, immediately turn the resistor down. (Note: 1. Usually, the volume control inside the radio is always connected before the detection circuit. If the noise occurs within the low-frequency circuit, the device will lose its effectiveness. 2. When you hear a loud scream, do not turn off the power switch, because when the radio suddenly stops working, a loud "pop" sound will occur in the earphones due to induction, and its volume is louder than any other interference.)</p>
<p>(2) Passive defense method: Only listen with one earphone during use, leaving the other one unused. In this way, at least half of the danger can be reduced.</p>
<p>(3) When you hear a loud noise, you can quickly open your mouth to equalize the air pressure inside and outside the eardrum, which can increase resistance considerably.</p>
<h3>Remedying Frequency Instability</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>If the frequency of a small-power shortwave transmitter is unstable, not only will long-distance communication become a dream, but also various unnecessary disturbances will easily occur. Therefore, we would rather reduce the output power and strive for frequency stability. The best way to stabilize the frequency is, of course, to use quartz crystals, but transmitters that do not even have an amplification stage rarely use quartz crystals, and other methods must be found. I will briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>The most common cause of frequency instability is that components in the machine are affected by external vibrations. The remedy, of course, is to reduce vibration. Replace all components in the machine with those that are strong and resistant to vibration, use thick and hard copper wire for the conducting wires, ensure that all devices are strong, and the oscillating part should be softly supported and kept away from the power supply and electrical components.</p>
<p>The insulation in the machine should be absolutely good, because if there is a leakage, not only will the frequency not be stable, but also the clarity and smoothness of the sound quality will be affected.</p>
<p>The heat generated by vacuum tubes and other components can also affect the stability of the frequency. The way to reduce this is to improve the efficiency of the transmitter; in other words, to obtain the maximum antenna output with a specified power input.</p>
<p>Adjust the antenna circuit to be slightly away from the best operating point. This method seems to be a loss on the surface, but it is actually beneficial, because in this way, the shaking of the antenna will not greatly affect the frequency.</p>
<p>The antenna and feeder should be fully tensioned so that they do not sway even in strong winds.</p>
<p>If using AC power, the filtering should be very carefully done.</p>
<p>In short, as long as we observe carefully and conduct systematic tests over a long period of time, it will not be difficult for us to achieve long-distance shortwave communication with a very small-power shortwave transmitter.</p>
<h3>Diode Detection</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengshi</p>
<p>Before the invention of the triode, it was certainly appropriate to use diodes for detection work. However, in today's rapid development of radio, few people use them except for rectification work.</p>
<p>But there are also advantages to using diode detection. First, the circuit is simple, and second, as long as it is applied properly, there will be no distortion, and even when encountering a wave modulated to 100 percent, this problem can be avoided.</p>
<p>The simplest diode detection circuit is shown in Figure 1. LC is a tuning circuit, one end is connected to the plate, and the other end is connected to the load resistor R and the bypass capacitor C.</p>
<p>If the received high-frequency signal is not amplitude-modulated, a stable DC voltage will be generated on R, because the high-frequency ripples have been filtered out by C. The value of this voltage is proportional to the strength of the signal. If the diode acts completely (i.e., the total resistance for current flowing in one direction is zero, and the total resistance for current flowing in the other direction is infinite), then this value is roughly equal to the maximum value of the high-frequency voltage.</p>
<p>If this high-frequency signal has been amplitude-modulated, the DC voltage will fluctuate up and down around the average position, producing a low frequency similar to the high-frequency signal oscillation.</p>
<p>So the current generated on R can now be regarded as two parts: one part is the stable DC generated by the main wave, and the other part is the AC generated by the amplitude modulation. As can be seen from the figure, due to the relationship of the rectifier tube, point A can never be more negative than point B. When a signal is modulated to 100 percent, the voltage across R must also drop to zero when the signal voltage is zero.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows how to measure the characteristic curve of a diode at different stable signal voltages. The battery E is used instead of the resistor R to represent the stable DC voltage across R. The external signal can be replaced by a low frequency for measurement.</p>
<p>If I change the voltage E and keep the signal voltage constant, I can draw a curve of voltage versus plate current, representing the characteristics of the diode under this signal voltage. Figure 3 shows a set of curves at different signal voltages. The one passing through point 〇 is the curve when the signal is zero, which does not often occur in practice, because if we use a hot-wire diode, electrons can still run from the cathode to the plate even when the signal voltage is zero.</p>
<p>In the figure, ×〇 is the load straight line, and its slope represents the resistance of R. (Assuming R is 250,000 ohms, a voltage of 2.5 volts can generate a current of 10 microamperes).</p>
<p>If the diode is connected to a 4-volt high-frequency signal, the operating point is at P at this time. If the main wave has been amplitude-modulated, the voltage will vibrate at this point. Assuming the amplitude modulation is 100 percent, this oscillation will change from P to the curve where the signal voltage is zero, and then rise to the 8-volt curve as shown in the figure.</p>
<p>Within this cycle, the current on R is exactly zero when the signal voltage is minimum. Therefore, it is known that this simple diode circuit can work very faithfully for this signal modulated to 100 percent.</p>

<h3>Various Antenna Substitute Methods</h3>
<p>— Wu Zipei</p>
<p>The antenna is an accessory of a radio. Not to mention crystal radios, even one-tube and multi-tube radios cannot do without it. Although multi-tube radios with high amplification can do without it, the effectiveness is always worse than using an antenna.</p>
<p>In the countryside, there is no problem with installing an antenna. In cities and towns, it is troublesome. Climbing on the roof and asking for the neighbor's permission to erect a bamboo pole is so tedious. Therefore, some amateur enthusiasts have to think about alternative methods due to environmental constraints. Those with ample economic resources can install several stages of high amplification to eliminate the antenna, but this is a minority. Most people are wandering on the path of crystal radios and one or two-tube radios, where can they install more high amplification stages? But "success" is finally achieved by those who work hard. Many amateur enthusiasts have made continuous efforts, and as a result, there are several alternative methods below: some have already been mentioned in this publication, and some have not yet been mentioned. Now I will introduce them in detail to provide general adoption.</p>
<p>(1) Using the downspout as a substitute: The downspouts in front of the eaves are made of lead skin, which can also absorb and conduct radio waves. Using it as a substitute for the antenna, the effectiveness is not bad, and many people use it because it is simple and safe. It can not only be used as a substitute for the antenna, but also as a good substitute for the ground wire.</p>
<p>(2) Using the electric light wire as a substitute: In places with electric lights, the flower wire (soft wire) or skin wire (hard wire) on the electric light can be used as a substitute for the antenna. Use seven or eight feet of flower wire to wrap around the outside of the skin wire or flower wire, one end connected to the antenna post of the radio, and the other end left to its own devices. This becomes an antenna substitute wire. This method is difficult to be effective on crystal radios, but it is effective on one or two-tube radios, but the sensitivity is a little worse.</p>
<p>(3) Antenna substitute: This is a ready-made product, and it is also sold on the market. In fact, it is a "plug", with a high-voltage resistant mica-type fixed storage capacitor in the middle. The effectiveness is very good, better than general indoor antennas or loop antennas. Unfortunately, the price is not cheap, and it is not something that general amateur enthusiasts are willing to use.</p>
<p>(4) Indoor antenna: An antenna installed indoors. This is the most commonly used substitute nowadays.</p>
<p>(5) The method of directly connecting to the electric light wire: The method in the third point above actually uses the electric light wire as the antenna, but a fixed capacitor is connected in the middle so that radio waves can pass unhindered, and alternating current is blocked by the capacitor and cannot be transmitted down. The human body touches the other end of the substitute, and there is no danger at all. In fact, if we use our brains to think a little, we can achieve this purpose without using a substitute.

<h3>Japanese Radio Stations Greatly Increase Power</h3>
<p>— Bi Shan</p>
<p>Radio is a modern tool for transportation and also a tool for external propaganda. The Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station in China has a power of 75 kilowatts (i.e., 75,000 watts), which is powerful and has a wide range. It is the best in the Far East. Although it is far away in Europe, Africa, and the United States, it is easy to receive. Neighboring Japan has always felt uneasy about this (years ago, the Japanese government accused the Japanese language broadcasts of the Central Radio Station of disrupting its domestic broadcasts, because Japanese radio stations had never exceeded 10 kilowatts). The Changchun 100-kilowatt radio station completed a few months ago is one part of its countermeasure. Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Communications also announced its expansion plan from 1935 to 1936. The plan includes increasing the power of Tokyo No. 1 Radio Station (Joak i 870K.C.) from 10 kilowatts to 150 kilowatts; Kumamoto Radio Station (Jogk 790K.C.) from 10 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts; Osaka No. 1 Radio Station (Jobk i 750K.C.) from 10 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts; and Ogura Radio Station (Josk 835 K.C.) from 1 kilowatt to 10 kilowatts. If it is realized, China will inevitably be threatened by it.</p>
<h3>AC/DC Dual-Purpose Single-Tube Radio for Long and Short Waves</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>AC/DC Dual-Purpose, Long and Short Wave Reception</p>
<p>This is the simplest long and short wave AC/DC radio in the world. Although it only uses one 12 A7 dual-function vacuum tube, the performance when receiving broadcasts is much better than ordinary one-tube radios, and it can also receive short waves. In addition, whether it is AC or DC, the plug can be inserted for use. The 12 A7 vacuum tube is actually equivalent to two vacuum tubes, because the 12 A7 is a pentode with characteristics similar to the 38 automobile vacuum tube, and a half-wave rectifier tube are combined. Although the filaments share one filament, they each have their own cathode, and there is a barrier between the two, so there is no difference in use from two separate vacuum tubes. There is no difficulty in manufacturing this machine. Because it needs to receive short waves as well, it should use metal panels and chassis, and the components should also be of high quality. The coil uses a plug-in coil tube with a diameter of one and seven-eighths inches, or the base of an old vacuum tube. The number of turns is detailed in the table below.</p>
<p>Band L1 L</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>Broadcast</p>
<p>The distance between L and L1 is three-sixteenths of an inch for the broadcast band, and one-sixteenth of an inch for the rest. All wires are made of enameled wire, 34 gauge for the broadcast band, 30 gauge for the 160-meter band, and 22 gauge for the rest. Component values are detailed below.</p>
<p>C Small 11-piece variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C1 .00015 variable capacitor.</p>
<p>C2 .0001 mica-type fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C3 .00025 mica-type fixed capacitor.</p>
<p>C4C5 .01 fixed capacitor with a voltage resistance of 400 volts.</p>
<p>C6C7 8 microfarads electrolytic capacitor.</p>
<p>R 5 megohms.</p>
<p>R1 360-ohm resistor wound with electric furnace wire.</p>
<p>R2 25,000 ohms.</p>
<p>R3 50,000-ohm potentiometer.</p>
<p>S Single-pole switch.</p>
<p>Other vacuum tube panels, chassis, etc. When in use. At the AC power outlet, the plug can be inserted regardless of positive or negative polarity. At the DC power outlet, the positive and negative polarities should be distinguished. If it is not possible to know in advance, you can insert it and try it.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Period of Drastic Change Has Not Fully Passed; The Gold Market Still Has Many Storms; The Soaring of Foreign Banks Caused a Fall; The Talk of Abandoning the Silver Standard Moved Buying Interest; Initially Fell, Then Rose Back to a Good 7 Yuan 1</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was still perilous, with widespread panic. Foreign banks surged, leading to a downward trend upon opening. Unexpectedly, news of China abandoning the silver standard suddenly spread, igniting a buying frenzy. However, the subsequent decline was also swift. The outcome was still firm. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both England and America rose uniformly, with trading above 125 after the close of major trading houses. Both spot and forward silver prices saw fluctuations. Exchange rates opened lower but closed higher. London spot gold fell by sixpence. The general sentiment, given China's large purchases of silver bars, or the central bank's prior purchases of shillings and spot goods, led to extremely low buying expectations and dampened spirits. Initial off-market trading broke the 50 yuan mark, retreating to 47-48 yuan. Sellers remained enthusiastic, continuing to drive prices down. The central bank's posted rates were revealed, showing rises in both England and America, and a decrease of 1.8 fen in the customs gold unit. The standard gold price was lowered to 923 yuan and 7 jiao. Trading opened lower in the morning. After the opening, the foreign exchange market hardened, and sellers surged, further breaking the 40 yuan mark. Banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply, managing to maintain prices. Later, Sassoon actively bought shillings, greatly boosting confidence, gradually breaking through the major barriers of 50 and 60 yuan. The Associated Press reported, based on sources from high-ranking officials, that China currently had no hope of securing loans and would abandon the silver standard to manage its currency system, adopting a sterling standard of approximately 1 shilling and 5 pence. This news further fueled buying interest, with major players covering short positions. Before long, the 70 yuan mark was breached. However, the surge was too extreme. The foreign exchange market was normal, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu continued to show intentions of selling. After the high, prices gradually declined. Sassoon also began to sell off. In addition, an Associated Press report quoted Minister Kong as saying that it was too early to abandon the silver standard. Selling pressure increased, and by noon, the price had fallen below the 60 yuan mark again. Later in the market, Indian silver was reported to rise. Unexpectedly, a telegram from Guomin News reported news of currency reform, stimulating buying and causing a sudden surge. However, due to a significant number of people selling at the high, prices declined again. The overall trend hovered around 60 yuan, extremely uncertain. Eventually, with buying still strong, those taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices gained the upper hand, and the market closed higher. The day saw significant fluctuations, making people even more frightened. The trend remains uncertain. The market situation for today is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 844 yuan and a half, 12 yuan and 2 jiao lower than the previous close. Hongxing's warrants rose to 5 yuan and a half. Fuyu, Hengyu, Hengchang, Xiaowuchang, Xiangqianchang, and Xiang's warrants were sold, falling to 40 yuan. Huabi bought 5-month shillings at .625. Yongli and Wanxing advanced warrants, rising to 3 yuan. Unsold 5-month shillings at .6625 were difficult to sell. Yingxiang, Dada, Hengyu, Huixiang, and Dafa sold warrants, falling to 38 yuan. Tongtaichang, Hengyu, Yuanmao, and Yong seized the opportunity to buy low, rising to 1 yuan. Hengchang, Yongyuanmao, Yongliyuanyi, and Fuxing sold warrants one after another, again falling to 38 yuan and a half. Huabi bought 5-month shillings at .875 and slightly rose. Hengyu, Yingxiang, Huixiang, and Dadecheng came to buy, rebounding to 44 yuan. Yifeng, Yonghengyu, Huixiang, and Yicheng sold warrants, falling to 39 yuan and a half. Sassoon bought 6-month shillings at half a penny, boosting confidence. Yuqingyong, Huixiang, Juchang, Hengyu, and Dafayong advanced warrants one after another, gradually rising to 47 yuan and a half. Hanheng and Hengyu sold, retreating to 3 yuan and a half. Sassoon continued to buy. Dafayong, Hengxing, Hengyu, and Yongli again advanced to 9 yuan. Huixiang and Hengyu seized the high to sell warrants, retreating to 1 yuan. Sassoon bought 6-month shillings at .4375, further fueling buying interest. Dadecheng, Dafayong, Tongfeng, Hengyiyu, Hengxingyuan, Dalianbang, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Qingfayong, etc., bought one after another. HSBC's listed rates were narrowed by .25 and half a yuan, gradually breaking through the 60 and 70 yuan barriers. An Associated Press report stated that China had abandoned the silver standard, igniting a surge, with speculators urgently covering short positions, pushing the price to 73 yuan. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Yifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong seized the high to sell, gradually declining. Rumors of the central bank selling warrants spread, causing many to sell off. The foreign exchange market was normal, and Qiao Zhifu intended to sell shillings, causing the price to fall back below 60 yuan. Dafayong, Huixiang, Runchangyuanyi, etc., sold down to 54 yuan and a half. Dadecheng and Muyu still advanced to 9 yuan on the cheap. Hengyu and Wanxing sold, retreating to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. Mitsui bought 6-month shillings at .4375. Changda, Wanchangyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Yicheng advanced to 63 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Huixiang, Dada, Tongyurun seized the high to sell, causing the price to fall to 53 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Lifeng, Hengchangyong seized the low again, advancing to 9 yuan and a half. However, confidence was shaken, and there was much floating profit-taking. Dadecheng also sold, retreating to 6 yuan and 3 jiao. Hengyu and Yuanmao maintained their positions on the cheap, still struggling. The noon close was 857 yuan. After the close, Dadecheng and others sold and were exhausted, gradually falling to 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 855 yuan and a half, with sentiment still good. A telegram from Guomin News contained information about currency reform, gradually rising from 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Yuanheng, Huixiang, Fuyu, and Hengyu all advanced, rising to 65 yuan and a half. Dafayong, Yongli, Fuxingyong, and Yingxiang seized the high to sell, falling to 1 yuan. Yuanmao, Fuan, Shunmao, and Jiarun still advanced. Korean bought 5-month US dollars at .4375, rising to 4 yuan and a half. Dafayong, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, and Hengchangyong sold, falling to .07 jiao. Yongli, Hanhengchangda still advanced to 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Dafayong, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, etc., sold warrants together, gradually falling to 57 yuan and a half. Dingkang and Hengyu maintained their positions on the cheap, rising to 61 yuan. Hengyu and Yuanchangyong still sold to 58 yuan. Fuyu, Fushengyong, Yuqingyong, Dafayong, and Chunyong bought warrants one after another, gradually rebounding to 63 yuan and 8 jiao. Yongli and others still sold to 60 yuan. Before long, the central bank bought 4-month shillings at .375. Qianchangxiang came to buy, rising to 5 yuan. Mitsui sold 3-month shillings at .4375. Tongtaichang, Fuxingyong, Yongliheng, Yutongyurun, etc., seized the high to sell, falling to 58 yuan and a half. At this time, the situation was mediocre, struggling around 60 yuan. Later, with Dingkang, Yuanchangyong, Yongliyuqingyong advancing warrants, rising to 64 yuan. Mitsui sold 4-month US dollars at .4375. Yuanmaoyong and Shunli seized the opportunity to sell to 2 yuan. Later, with those raising prices extremely enthusiastic, Yuqingyong, Dafayong, Yuanmao, Qianchangxiang, and Dadecheng advanced to 6 yuan and a half. Dafayong and Hongxing sold, and the close was 863 yuan and 8 jiao. After the close, it was still stable. The highest price for the day was 873 yuan, and the lowest price was 838 yuan, a fluctuation of 35 yuan. The result was an increase of 7 yuan and 1 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price saw the central bank's standard gold price retreat to 923 yuan and 7 jiao. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 60 yuan short. The result was approximately 16 yuan less than the previous close. Four-month ledger entries were 857 yuan. The morning water supplement was 849 yuan. The after-market ledger entries for April were 864 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was 856 yuan. Red gold was approximately 4 yuan higher, at 848 yuan and a half. Spot goods still saw no transactions. Tianjin goods were approximately 8 yuan higher.</p>
<p>In-market trading was still strong. In total, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Yuqingyong, Jiarun, Hengchangyong, and Lifeng were among the sellers. Tongfengheng, Qianchangxiang, Dingkangheng, Xingyuan, Yuanyi, Hongxingyiyu, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, etc., were among the buyers. Yuanmaoyong and Fuyu Shenkang advanced first and then exited.

Shunli jointly did 22,300 warrants, breaking even by over 100 warrants. Guangbang Shenghang and Hengxing advanced and exited 100 warrants each. The total number of transactions for the day was 70,861 warrants in the morning market and 27,979 warrants in the afternoon market. The total number of April futures was 20,167 warrants. In total, there were 46 long parties and 57 short parties.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rising Clearly but Tightening Secretly; Chinese Merchants Are Still Selling</h3>
<p>According to foreign reports yesterday, London's major silver bars, both near and far term, rose .4375. After the market close, a large transaction took place above the listed price of 125. The New York silver price rose .75. The Montevideo forward silver price rose or fell by 2.5 centimos. London spot gold contracted sixpence. Sterling against the dollar fell 2.625. The dollar against sterling rose by three points. Sterling against the dollar fell thirty-eight pounds. The dollar against the French franc contracted by half a centime. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices. Sterling was one shilling seven pence six two five. The US dollar was thirty-nine yuan. Compared to the previous close, sterling was loose point zero six two five, and the US dollar was hard three one two five. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced. Sterling rose one two five. The US dollar rose half a yuan. The customs gold unit decreased by one point eight cents. The psychology of Chinese merchants was depressed. The process hardened after opening. HSBC's posted rates were announced. Sterling rose half a penny. The US dollar rose one yuan two five. There were multiple plates in the process. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy. Sassoon came to cover short positions again, and it became tight quickly. Afterwards, the Associated Press reported that China intended to abandon the silver standard and control exchange rates. HSBC's posted rates contracted point two five and half a yuan, exciting people. The process was extremely tight. However, since Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu, etc., still had selling appetite, the situation was still difficult to support. Finally, the Associated Press reported that Finance Minister Kong talked about adopting the gold exchange system, and the news that the time was too early came, and the process gradually hardened again. Sassoon also sold. Later, Indian silver was reported to rise eight annas, but because the Guomin News telegram was favorable to the buyer, the process gradually tightened. Although Chinese merchants took advantage of the high price to sell, the situation was still tight because the Central and HSBC banks worked hard to buy. However, there was quite a lot of maneuvering along the way. The closing selling price for the near term was Sterling one shilling seven pence four three seven five. The US dollar was thirty-eight yuan six eight seven five. Compared to the previous close, Sterling was tight one two five, and the US dollar was flat. Chinese merchants sold approximately 100,000 pounds Sterling and more than 300,000 US dollars. Sassoon initially bought and then sold. Hong Kong also had telegraphic sales. However, British and American tobacco companies still settled their accounts. The Central Bank bought slightly. Today's transaction record is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Industries and Merchants Are About to Launch, but Credit Tightening Makes Smooth Progress Difficult</h3>
<p>Recently, with the passing of the New Year according to the old lunar calendar, various commercial purchases and sales are launching in succession. In past years, this would have been an extremely prosperous period. This year, however, silver and money businesses are cautiously lending, with no room for flexibility, making the market very depressed. Yesterday's market conditions saw the foreign discount rate remain at 8%, the same as the previous day, while the market situation remained clearly loose but secretly tight. Headings also still had no water added. In the early market, transaction transfers were over 3.5 million, with over 400,000 in new transactions. Afternoon market transactions were over 300,000. Transactions in the Little General Association were over 800,000. Foreign mortgage transactions took back over 500,000, making over 600,000. Banknotes collected back over 600,000, issuing over 600,000 in bonds and 800,000 in memorandums. Customer sources were 200,000, and sales were 150,000. Bank collections and releases saw foreign banks collect and release bills and payments of over 2.9 million, various goods, remittances, mortgages, miscellaneous payments of over 4.8 million, special remittances of over 800,000, foreign exchange settlements of over 1.3 million, and warehouse releases of 500,000. Chinese banks collected and released bills and payments of over 2.3 million, various goods, remittances, mortgages, tax and miscellaneous payments of over 4.8 million, special remittances of over 700,000, foreign exchange settlements of over 900,000, and warehouse entries of 300,000. Japanese banks collected and released bills and payments of over 1.3 million, various goods, remittances, mortgages, miscellaneous payments of over 2.8 million, special remittances of over 300,000, foreign exchange settlements of over 800,000, and warehouse entries of 200,000. Money shops and foreign public sheets collected and released over 19 million, foreign headings collected and released over 3.5 million, various remittances over 600,000, and collected and released cash. The total number of exchanged bills was 7,523,212 yuan 3 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars, including 4,110,363 yuan 3 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars and 3,412,849 yuan in remittance silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Single Mill and Copper Coins Rose Slightly Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars had an inertia of 835 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Only 2,000 jiao were traded in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollars had an initial quotation of 734 yuan 2 jiao in the morning market, a rise of 2 jiao compared to the previous day, with 195,000 jiao traded. The afternoon market was 734 yuan 8 jiao, another increase of 6 jiao compared to the morning market, with 110,000 jiao traded. Copper coins had an inertia of 331,000 in both the morning and afternoon, a decrease of 500 cash compared to the previous day. A total of 43,030 strings of cash were traded, equivalent to 13,000 yuan in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Loan Rumor Appears and Disappears; Bonds Seem Shrouded in a Thin Mist</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market returned to a path of maneuvering and brewing. Although Finance Minister Kong did not deny international loans, there are still many obstacles, and it cannot be achieved in one fell swoop. In this situation of appearing and disappearing, and with the air not yet factual, market prices also followed suit without stability. The scope of transactions sometimes calmed down, seeming to gradually shrink, and sometimes became lively, turning prosperous again. Market prices also rose and fell without certainty. The longer the brewing, the greater the future market changes. The eyes of both long and short positions are now completely focused on the loan. Different people have different views, each taking their own judgment as a starting point. The barriers between the two sides are built higher and higher. With the strength of the close, there are signs of recovery in the future trend. Yesterday's events saw the morning opening generally return by one or two jiao, and up to three jiao. The second session returned by one or two jiao, and some even by three jiao. Numbers 35 and 46, etc., were sold, while numbers 20 and 40 were bought. Number 23 pass 4 was bought, showing considerable appetite. Although seller number 14 had stopped, a large batch of number 53 was sold again, so neither session was able to rise. The afternoon opening was initially weak but later strong. Number 23 pass still showed no improvement. The close was initially flat and firm. Number 16 suddenly advanced 20 rolls, abruptly raising it to over 51 yuan. People's hearts were once again excited, and the back rows all turned upwards, generally returning by two or three jiao. Confidence was firm and high, and short selling was not yet the time. The market price resulted in number 23 pass being slightly down by three or four jiao, although number 4 was bought, because number 53 was still being sold fiercely. Most other types were good by five cents to one jiao to three or four jiao, but the consolidated tax was good by five or six jiao. The total number of transactions was approximately 25 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>US Stocks Still Show No Real Improvement</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (7th) the New York stock market rose slightly, but because the currency situation was uncertain, the market remained sluggish. Railway stocks still showed no improvement. Federal Transportation Adjuster Isman said in a speech at the New York Chamber of Commerce that if the roads did not cooperate with each other and with the government, they would only be taken over by the government. New York and London silver prices were at their highest peak in six years yesterday. The bond market fell under the leadership of US government bonds. Although the government repeatedly stated that the dollar's fineness would never be reduced again, there were few buyers. Small exchange stocks were very flat. The total daily transaction volume was 540,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>6th  7th  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks  100.13  101.17  Up 0.95</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Fall Sharply, Then Slightly Rebound</p>
<p>After the sharp fall in the yarn market the previous day, it rose again today, but the trend felt increasingly uncertain. This was because, after the market price fell, long companies came to drag it forward again, and their false wind was extinguished. At the same time, gold prices also showed a hesitant trend. Floating sellers, seeing the strong efforts of the long parties, did not act rashly. However, the general short positions with real strength remained strong and unmoved, so the market showed a hesitant appearance again.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster First Fell, Then Rebounded</p>
<p>In the spot yarn market opening, all months showed weakness and depression. Because the previous day's remaining momentum had not died down, and the situation of foreign cotton was not good, the near months fell particularly sharply in the first plate. When the market price fell, the long side came to buy again to maintain it. 850 bales were advanced this month, and the far months also followed. The second plate suddenly turned up, and all months rose past the first plate. The close was calm, but the securities group threw out a large amount. As a result, all months rose by 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 jiao. The afternoon opening fell slightly. The auction rose slightly to the second and third plates, but trading in the field was not prosperous, and the market price did not change much. There were fewer spot yarn sales locations, and as a result, the near term was flat and the far term rose by 1 and 2 jiao. 1,050 bales of Tongji were sold, 2,300 bales of Jinchang, 700 bales of Mingde, 550 bales of Tongfeng, 450 bales of Tongxing, 500 bales of Yuanyi, 1,000 bales of Runkang, 450 bales of Dafu, and 400 bales of Junchang. 550 bales of Yuda, 400 bales of Dafeng, 2,600 bales of Yichang, 650 bales of Hengde, 500 bales of Shenji, and 500 bales of Renfeng were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were slightly clearer, less than before. A total of 1,166 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day. Market quotations did not change much. The purchase amounts of each group are listed below.</p>
<p>Mainland 220 Shantou 95 Yunnan 350</p>
<p>Tianjin 230 Guangdong 105 Jiangxi 30</p>
<p>Sichuan 70 Wuhu 3 Xuzhou 13</p>
<p>Haizhou 45 Fujian 5</p>
<p>After a Sharp Fall in the Cotton Market, a Small Rebound Slightly Appeared</p>
<p>However, the overseas cotton market was still softening, the fall in Indian cotton was renewed, and new low prices were found. There were also falling price messages from production areas on all routes. There are more than 1 million dan of cotton stored in Shanghai alone, so foreign merchants' short selling amounts have not moved at all.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rebounded by 2 Jiao</p>
<p>Before the spot cotton market opened, most expected it to fall by several jiao, because Indian cotton fell sharply and new lows were found, and gold prices also fell by more than ten yuan in rough plates. At the opening of the first plate, the near months fell slightly by 5 fen, and the far months rose by 1 jiao instead. There was a lack of sellers in the field, and the situation was tense, but when it came to the close of the auction, it turned flat again. As a result, the near months did not move, and the far rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that gold prices were high again, and floating households in the field covered, bringing the market disk tight. However, the current cotton stock is still high, and all months rose by 5 fen to 1 and a half jiao. It was found that Suilong sold 7,600 dan, Jinchang 1,300 dan, Gengfeng 2,300 dan, Tongxing 2,500 dan, Yuanyi 2,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,300 dan, Changhe 1,000 dan, Taichang 1,200 dan, and Shengyuan 2,500 dan. Dafu bought 4,500 dan, Mingde 2,300 dan, Renfeng 3,800 dan, Taichang 1,000 dan, Runkang 2,100 dan, Yichang 1,400 dan, and Changfeng 2,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Mill Needs Turned Weak</p>
<p>Because foreign exchange has turned long, Indian cotton has fallen sharply, and mill needs are even more silent.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 52.00 Gongda Mill Enters 82 Pieces Spot Goods Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 42.10 Shenxin Mill Enters 500 Bales Again Again</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton 40.00 Again 500 Bales Again Again</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 40.50 Hengfeng Mill Enters 500 Bales Again Again</p>
<h3>US Cotton Activity Still Awaits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, but market conditions were not active. The price fluctuations were not significant due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Liverpool and mainland dealers sold, while fertilizer merchants closed out long positions. Prices for various months fell by one to three points. Subsequently, fellow traders and local dealers bought in, and it was reported that Senator Smith proposed stockpiling 5.5 million bales for a period of two years, and planned to lend cotton farmers 15 cents per pound this year. Market prices rose, but fellow traders remained cautious, awaiting more concrete developments. Currently, the textile industry is poor and needs to be dismal. The market closed steadily. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices fluctuated by one to three points. The British cotton market was weak and tired. Spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 3 to 4 points. Indian cotton softened due to selling by speculators and operators. Pingol fell by 4 rupees, Olram fell by 3.5 rupees, and Bai Luoqi fell by 4.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th day telegram).</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoqi cotton on the 8th was 242 rupees, an increase of 0.25 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains Flour and Wheat Also Change with Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Flour Yesterday's flour market, Chicago Western Wheat reported an increase of 2-3 points, and Canada increased by 4 points. When the opening price was in the morning, although Western wheat rose, it fell as soon as the gold price started. Therefore, people's hearts were calm after the opening, and they could not hold on. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, it was about half a point less. Later, as the gold price rebounded, and the spot flour was still tightly squeezed, people's hearts rose again, but both sides mostly watched, and the transaction was not smooth. By the afternoon opening, this month's customers slightly absorbed, although it is currently unable to draw cash, the future will always be squeezed, and the long-term is also slightly offset because the factory has not come out, so people's hearts also see it go up. After observing the steps, I am afraid that the tightness of the spot goods still has a good trend. As a result, this month rose 2.25 points, April and May rose 2.25 points, June rose 2 points, July rose 1.75 points, and August rose 2 points.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday's futures wheat market, due to the rise of Western wheat and the initial fall of gold prices, both buyers and sellers tended to wait and see, and the transaction was very light. By the afternoon opening, this month was still flat at the beginning, and then the flour market turned up, and the gold price rose again, so the buying enthusiasm was slightly smoother, and the market price was also better. This situation is almost entirely transferred from foreign cabinets. As a result, this month rose 3 points, April rose 4 points, July rose 4 points, and August rose 2 points. The current wheat is still solid, because the arrival stock is not rich, and the factory stomach is still continuing. The opening price of Guider wheat was 3 yuan, 7 jiao and 7 fen, Bengbu wheat was 3 yuan, 7 jiao and a half, and Haizhou wheat was 3 yuan, 7 jiao and 3 fen, totaling 1,000 bags, which was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Bran Yesterday's bran market was generally stable. Because the exchange rate fluctuated greatly, the Japanese exchange rate could not be fully allocated, so foreign banks had little activity yesterday. The way to go to the inland banks was still active. The scattered brand bran shouted 2 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 fen to 2 yuan and 7 jiao, but the Shenda Dumu bran shouted to 2 yuan and 7 jiao net.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market in Hexia Continues to Be Tight</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were more abundant, with more than 20 numbers arriving, with a total of more than 4,000 shi of goods. The market conditions were slightly stable, and the sales ground was quite moving. The package stomach Tianjin Yantai gang handled more than 1,000 packages. The situation continued to be tight, so the price of each thick japonica rice was increased by Qi Jiao Xu. The late rice rose by several points to Qi Jiao Xu. Dujian was flat, and Yinbian Yuan Wumingrong humiliated.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Hexia were about 20. The market sales were normal. The price of white japonica rice was expensive because the goods fell sparsely. The thin rice followed the big number of points, and the other prices were stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Local Merchants Are Both Active, and the Yangtze River Continues to Be Loaded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice and local customers went to Wang. The appetites of the mainland gangs were even more greedy. Saigon Lai Grain was handled by the local customers, and the price rose by 78 points. The others were standing firm. A total of 14,800 packages of rice were opened in the city. In addition to more than 2,000 packages of Saigon and Xiaowen from this street, they were all handled by the mainland. The Yangtze River gangs did not ask for them. However, the direct loading of Nanshi firms was about 20,000 or more. The selling prices of Hankou and Jiujiang were high. There is still a continuous need for it in the future. Some cargo owners of Ke Xian asked to get rid of the cargo, and 500 packages of Hunanji Hong were opened, and the price fell by ten cents.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea The Reason for the Stagnation of the Silk Market High Silver Prices... Unstable Exchange Market</h3>
<p>The recent stagnation of the silk market is due to the high silver prices and the unstable exchange market. Overseas silk prices are not much different. However, combining Shanghai silver, the drop is alarming, and it enters a deadlock. In the past, according to the Yokohama price calculation, Chinese silk was only worth 420 to 30 yuan. In the early spring, most people expected that overseas silk prices would have a high increase, but it was just a flash in the pan. In the future, the only opportunity for Chinese silk is in April and May. If the supply of Japanese silk is insufficient, there may be a need for overseas. However, silk merchants should not adhere to the fallacy of not selling unless the price is high. Because our country is in an economically invaded position, it is unable to stabilize the international exchange rate equalization policy. Only merchants should carefully handle their own interests. Attached is the New York February raw silk inventory telegram as left,</p>
<h3>Oil Market Hongjiang Tung Oil Selling Discounters are Being Discussed</h3>
<p>Since Hongjiang Tung Oil was affected by the white tung oil涨风, the market has gradually entered a state of tension. According to the news from the Hakka side, Deputy Hong has a tendency to stop selling. The Zhenghong such as Jichang Heji Yingfeng brand, is even more resident. Last night, I received a telegram from Zhenjiang, saying that the customer discs opened because there were not many goods, only a few were available for sale, and there was a trend of immediate addition. Therefore, the local companies and public discussions on the sale of the disk, Jichang and 28 yuan, 8 jiao per barrel, Jiying double 27 yuan, 2 jiao, and the demand is greater than the supply, and the buyers can not be satisfied. I am afraid that the 涨风 Fang and Weiai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Guangdong Crude White is Firmly Marked</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was stable because the Guanjin had little ups and downs. The guild's planned disc 24 crude sand white was 16 yuan and 9 jiao, and there was a slight transaction. The transshipment goods were called 4 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, and it was not successful. The original price of the factory's cotton white did not change. Yesterday, the sugar industry cooperation company sold a batch of Guangdong crude white totaling 380 packages, the price was 16 yuan and 9 jiao, the transshipment Guanzhan cargo Dutch crude white 50 packages, 4 yuan and 9 jiao, and the rest lacked a transaction.</p>
<h3>Hardware The Selling Discounters of Tin are Extremely Loose and Abusive</h3>
<p>The transaction of Dianxi, recently because the Shaoxing Gang still has no purchase, and the Ningbo Jiujiang Nanjing Gangs also have few transactions, so the market situation is strangely soft, but the arrival of goods is extremely large, and the silver root is extremely urgent. , I have to cut prices to seek the Lord, not to mention the recent overseas telegrams, which are also very weak. Therefore, the market in this port is more loose and abusive, resulting in a gradual decline in the standard, and there is a great momentum that cannot be stopped. The current market price of Xiaopu Xi is estimated to be 156, 7 yuan, Dutch Xi 174, 5 yuan, and Fuzu Xi 180 yuan. Compared with the previous market, it has fallen by 2 or 3 yuan. It is heard that in terms of actual delivery, the environmental conditions of all parties are still very few. Therefore, the general Xi merchants are worried about it.</p>
<h3>Correction from a Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, Recently I read the commercial news market price column of your newspaper on the 5th of this month, the cotton yarn part, which stated that the price of 12 wake lion brand cotton yarn produced by our company was 161 yuan, which is very strange. Our company's products have always been welcomed by various places due to their excellent quality. The price sold is also higher than ordinary due to cost reasons, which is well known in the yarn industry. I have never sold this price. On the 4th of this month, 5 packages were handled by the Yong Gang, and the price was 172 yuan. Your newspaper reported 161 yuan, a difference of as much as 11 yuan, which is obviously a factual error in the interview. Because customers from all over the world have sent letters of inquiry, a special letter is returned to declare, which is related to our company's reputation. We must ask you to correct it in the original column as soon as possible to avoid misunderstandings. We will be very grateful. Lita Textile Company Shanghai Office,</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Worries and Hardships)</p>
<p>People stand on the battlefield of the world, fighting endlessly, very seriously. In the end, they all die and rot in the same way. Why not "be content and happy"!</p>
<p>The wind and rain of spring night blew down many flowers on the branches? But, if you think about it carefully, the wind and rain of spring night can also help the buds on the branches to gradually open, then there is no sadness.</p>
<p>A woman, after the death of her husband, she only said, when her husband was alive, how good and affectionate he was to her. A man, after the death of his wife, he did not say how good and affectionate his dead wife was, because his newly married wife was better than the dead one.</p>
<h3>The Spring Colors of Tiger Hill</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Spring has arrived in the world, and Tiger Hill outside Suzhou City is crowded with many tourists again, especially on Sundays. On that day, guests from Shanghai came to admire the spring colors of Tiger Hill, adding a lot of footprints.</p>
<p>Mei also suddenly came to Suzhou, especially for the important purpose of visiting Tiger Hill and appreciating the plum blossoms in Lengxiang Pavilion. Therefore, for the sake of the host, I had to sit in an antique carriage with him and move towards Tiger Hill Road.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Wangshan Bridge, we got out of the car, took a breath, stretched, turned the corner and walked into Tou Shanmen, and we met the village children selling wheat firewood fans. Maybe it was a bit out of season! But this is a special product of Tiger Hill, of course, it is regarded as an exception. The white orchid sellers also came, and the old man who sold Chenpimei and explained the historical sites also showed me good power.</p>
<p>I played in the Tiger Fuge Pavilion, watched the Imperial Stele Pavilion, sat in Xiaowu Xuan for a while, walked to the bottom of the fifty-three ginseng, took a photo, went to Lengxiang Pavilion, drank a few mouthfuls of tea, leaned on the window to admire the plum blossoms, but the plum blossom trees seemed too few, and no more were planted. In Lengxiang Pavilion, there is no fragrance to be obtained!</p>
<p>Mei sold some generations of flowers, roses, Suzhou guides, Tiger Hill trivia, etc., and prepared to send them back to good friends. Maybe he boasted that he was a plum blossom visitor in Lengxiang Pavilion, how elegant!</p>
<p>Spring has arrived in the world, and the spring colors of Tiger Hill may soon pass away. Come and enjoy it soon!</p>
<h3>Unhappy Couple</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>It wasn't until Mr. Tian and Wang Caigu had been married for three months that I knew what kind of couple was called an "unhappy couple."</p>
<p>"Mr. Tian, is your new sister-in-law good to you?"</p>
<p>Everyone had to ask with a bit of teasing and happiness. No matter the adults and children, men and women, when they saw Mr. Tian pacing out of his own door, they always piled up a smile and entangled him. Some young men even dragged him and forced him to talk about the love in the boudoir, happily.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tian never frowned deeply.</p>
<p>"What are you kidding me? This...this, ha, should it be my destiny?... "Seemed to have suffered an injustice.</p>
<p>This made everyone fascinated. Why did Mr. Tian become so resentful after marriage? In the past, when he stepped into society from school, he was optimistic about everything. He despised the thing of fate at all, but now it is not right. Since Wang Caigu stepped into his door, he has completely changed.</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Tian, could it be that your new sister-in-law doesn't suit your...your..."</p>
<p>This kind of words should be older women, half true and half false, asking him to the end.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tian always sighed, put his hands behind his back, and paced out of the lane, without giving an answer. At the same time, everyone saw Wang Caigu shedding tears by the tap, and sometimes sobbing in the quilt alone in the middle of the night. She thought of sitting in a sedan chair, thinking of worshiping heaven and earth, thinking of...</p>
<p>"Why should I marry a man who doesn't love me?"</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Tian moved his bedding to the company to sleep.</p>
<p>Everyone sighed for this unhappy couple.</p>
<h3>Highest Goal</h3>
<h3>Xiaoxitian</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Tang Tu Female Lang Former Lu Cai Xuan Se Kai Yu Wall Gap is ill and hurts Lian</p>
<p>But Yueying had heard these two parties very clearly, and she was also thoroughly calculating in her heart. She suddenly stood up and said with a straight face: No, no, I won't do that. Mom, don't say that we knocked off your job. I think, even if I am sold, I have to talk about the price. If I follow people like this in a muddle, what's the matter? Even if I want it tonight, will people still want it tomorrow night? A person's body is not one and a half catties of meat, so it is sold in piles to people. Sell, I want to do a sale once in my life, so that I am selling zero, what do you want me to be? Today, for the sake of those foreign money, I ruined my body, what will happen in the future? I want to go! Saying that, she turned around and meant to walk out. At this moment, Jia Duocai rushed into the house from the outside, waving his hands at him and smiling: Don't yell, don't yell! I can't see that this girl still has such a set of words. Yueying blushed and lowered her head, and sat down again, but she turned her body sideways and looked inside. Zhang Jiefu stood up and cupped his hands at him and smiled: My mouth is too clumsy, and I can't be a matchmaker. When I pick up the axe, I chop it on the Gui Bridge, and I chop a gap. I quit, and I am not qualified to be a Yue Lao. Jia Duocai also returned the gift with a smile: It's not your fault, it's just that I'm too confused. I heard the girl's words back and forth several times outside the window. I can't imagine that this girl is such a talking person. Zhu Hushi said: When he is at home, he can talk, but now he is out and unfamiliar, he dare not talk. (152)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Piaoyu Records</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When it came time for dinner, he said to us, "This is completely no problem! Because after the emperor returns to Beijing, there is nothing major "for him to deal with". This is a lie! In fact, it means that he himself has no major things to deal with at present. "Fortunately, the day of the sacrifice to the Great Temple is still four days away! So we can rest quietly for a few days: Tomorrow morning, everyone will prepare together, and we will go to the garden early in the morning."</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager was accustomed to getting up early, and at the same time there was another reason that made him always like to leave the palace for the Summer Palace early in the morning; this reason was also a superstition. Because one day, he chatted with a prince who was in charge of the affairs of the Astronomical Observatory, and accidentally asked what time of day was the most auspicious? The prince's reply was that the most auspicious time was when the sun first rose in the morning. So the Empress Dowager deeply believed it, and insisted on getting out of the palace as early as possible every time: accidentally, he developed a very healthy habit.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, just at the time when the rising sun rose, we, including Guangxu, were led by the Empress Dowager, still with a bit of the urgency like yesterday, got into the sedan chair and left the palace, and drove to the Summer Palace one after another.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the garden, we realized that it was indeed worth getting up early here! (263)</p>
<h3>Tang Family Tomb</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>The most magnificent and luxurious tomb in Fengxian is the Tang Family Tomb.</p>
<p>According to Yun; there are a total of seventy-two Tang Family Tombs: Gu Mu can only see four or five places, and their forms are actually made exactly the same. The tomb base occupies a large area, all built with bluestone, covered with earth, shaped like a small mountain. In front of the tomb, the Huabiao is towering, and the Wengzhong holds the Chaohu, standing opposite each other; there are also stone-carved lions, horses, sheep, rabbits, etc., all arranged in pairs. In the feudal era, everything that could express vanity was available! However, its tomb road has long been opened up as farmland, and many stone beasts have turned over and lie in the grass, and the tomb feet have been eroded by farmers. This is inevitable to see, and a sense of vicissitudes of the past and the present.</p>
<p>I heard people say before that these tombs are all the ancestral tombs of the Tang family in Beihang Township in the county, built in the middle of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, a certain ancestor of his was promoted to the ranks of Weike and became prominent, and later he was condemned for corruption and suffered the death penalty. When it came to collecting the corpse and embalming it, the head had been lost; so he hired craftsmen overnight, melted gold into liquid, and cast two human heads into the coffin. He was also afraid that it would be stolen after burial, so he followed the example of the ancients' "suspicious tomb" and built seventy-two tombs at the same time to confuse people. It seems like this story, it is better to treat it as Qi Dong's wild words, and listen to it.</p>
<p>It is said that the Tang family is indeed a family of sages, and the industry has declined. There was an imperial library in his home, which was used to store Chen Han; later, it was destroyed by fire and turned into ashes, and there is still a piece of tile left. It can be seen that it can be said that it was rich and noble three hundred years ago, and it was prominent for a while! So I can build such a few magnificent tombs. Otherwise, how could there be such a magnificent system and strong material resources?</p>
<p>Local Chronicles</p>
<h3>Sixty Years Ago, the Seal Ceremony of the Shanghai Official Market</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Press Agency</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the current administrative officer's inauguration was called "taking the seal" in ancient times. However, at that time, how did this seal be taken? Now, people are not unfamiliar with the inauguration ceremony of general officials, but when it comes to the seal ceremony of the Shanghai official market in the past, I am afraid that our young people do not know it very well.</p>
<p>Ha! You are sneering! You said this is nonsense! I want to say that you are ignorant! In the past, we said that the official market in the past was too feudal, didn't we? You say, how feudal are they, tell me to listen?</p>
<p>Okay, you shake your head, you said this is very long. That's right! I'll introduce you to this simple one...</p>
<p>It was the nineteenth day of March in the third year of Guangxu, Shanghai had a Taoist platform at that time, whose name was Ruifen, who took office after Feng Jun Guang, and took the seal on this night. That "ceremony", you listen!</p>
<p>(1) Sealing the Seal At 10 pm, the Taoist County Bailiff prepared all the ceremonies and waited for the old Taoist to release the seal, and then sealed the two seals for the colorful pavilion and entrusted the Shanghai County Grain Hall to send them to the new Taoist's residence, which is located in the General Bureau of Contributions in the east of the county.</p>
<p>(2) Purple Qi Comes from the East Afterwards, Liu Daotai set off from the bureau, of course, he took a sedan chair. From the east, go west, pass the county government, and you have to keep going, the sedan chair should be square and stable. That's called "Purple Qi Comes from the East".</p>
<p>(3) Peace Without Incident After the sedan chair passed the Sanpai Fang, it circled around Taiping Street and then went east to take the meaning of peace.</p>
<p>(4) Walking Around the Qinglong When he arrived at the west gate of the Daotai Yamen, he did not go in, but continued to go south and then north, and entered the department from the east gate. This is called "Walking Around the Qinglong".</p>
<p>(5) General's Order At this time, the night was almost over, and the streets were quiet. All the followers were very neat. At that time, there was a garrison guard from the Right Battalion of the Ti Biao, and a Western-style drum squad from the Hujun Battalion to greet him, playing the General's Order with Western-style drums, and proceeding slowly along the road. The majesty was very awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Then, after entering the yamen, there are still ceremonies, and the procedure is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sacrificing the Door (2) Thanking En (3) Worshiping the Seal (4) Sitting in Public</p>
<p>At this time, it is exactly twelve o'clock. The Yin and Yang academics reported that when the son card was divided, the civil and military officials waited in two shifts; the sound of cannons and music, one blowing and one ringing; therefore, the inside and outside of the yamen were extremely busy, and the seal ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>By the next morning, the Taoist was busy with the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Checking the Treasury (2) Ordering Mao (3) Visiting the Temple to Light Incense (4) Meeting the Consul (5) Reviewing and Recording the Substitute Book (6) Hanging the Plaque to Release the Allegation... You see, isn't this very different from now?</p>

<h3>Nanpu Fu Chuncao on Jiangwan Road</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The shadows dye the traces of the scorpion, and the guest Guanxin is always early around the horizon. Lightly rippling green waves, the east wind is soft, blowing warmth on the ancient road of the desolate continent. Try to find Fang, drunk sleep in a good place to hear the home is so green, count the pond dreams, how many times have you been to. Green meaning on the expedition shirt, dust dust, has not failed the Jun tour embrace. Cuiyan Piaomiao. Walk slowly and step on Jiangnan Xiao. Rest for the day of prosperity and decline, a blue indifference is good.</p>

<h3>On Selections</h3>
<p>— Bai Ju</p>
<p>In the world, literature—especially novels and dramas—books are truly as vast as the misty sea. In this busy and tense modern age, it is truly a dream to demand a thorough reading of all books. Therefore, besides some general overviews and lectures, there arises a category of things called selections. Of course, I am not saying that there were no selections in ancient times, but rather that such things are more suitable to the various conditions of the modern age and have gained their social basis of superiority. Taking novels alone, many publications such as selected works, collected works, and masterpieces have appeared in our country, but these cannot all be classified as being for-profit. A refined selection can naturally weed out the trivial and return to the pure. If the work is the essence of an author, then we can also say that a selection is the essence of the author's entire works, right?</p>
<p>However, this task of sifting gold from sand is not easy.</p>
<p>In the past, I have seen collections of writers published abroad, selecting one or two thick volumes from a vast number of works. This provides a lot of convenience for readers who don't have the time, energy, or opportunity to read the complete works of the original. Take the Hugo selections published by the Larousse Bookstore in France as an example. It divides his literary life into four periods: youth, adulthood, exile, and old age. Important works such as Les Misérables, Ninety-Three, and The Man Who Laughs (with annotations at the abridged sections), as well as important prose dramas (excluding poetic dramas) and short letters are all included. Although we cannot get to know Hugo's full picture from this, or use this as a basis for studying Hugo, we can still see a rough outline. We also have some such selections in China.</p>
<p>But the problem then arises: is such a selection reliable? Does the selector only rely on subjective likes and dislikes, or on objective evaluation to determine the criteria for selection? What kind of scale does he use? Does he have a deeper understanding and clearer knowledge of the original author? In this modern age of the most active critical spirit, we must also go through a selection process for the selectors of books. A selector must have the broad knowledge and keen discernment of a critic, so that he can have an objectively reliable measure of the works. He must also have the imagination and appreciation of a writer, so that he can subjectively savor the works. Here, I would like to mention a book that people don't pay attention to, which is the Romain Rolland selection compiled by Marcel Martinet. He himself is a writer and has a unique study of Rolland's thoughts and art. The book begins with a very long preface, explaining Rolland's thoughts. Among them, Rolland's important works such as biographies of famous people, dramas, and masterpieces such as Jean-Christophe are selected for their essence, arranged by month, and each paragraph is accompanied by clues to the full text and detailed explanations by the selector. Even if his views are still problematic, his cautious attitude is worth learning from.</p>
<p>As for those currently engaged in selection work, it seems that this is not the end. Of course, it is even more impossible to just list the titles of the articles and cut and paste them together and be done with it. Instead, it is necessary to further point out the aesthetic and sociological value of the works, reveal the ultimate causes of the entire trend of thought and the entire school of thought lurking behind the author, and provide readers with methods and materials for appreciation, research, interpretation, and criticism, so that they can verify and discover with the works in the collection during reading, so as to obtain a correct understanding. Under this rigorous critical system, all selections that are impressionistic, subjective, and shift according to personal preferences will gradually be discarded and become useless things. Then such selection work can also be called a part of literary criticism and literary history work, although on the surface it just saves readers some effort in cutting out the redundant and deleting the trivial.</p>
<h3>Traveler, Cherish Your Youth</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>The raindrops, like the hearts of the unemployed, were dull and heavy.</p>
<p>It was the early spring season, but the gloomy cold wind was still sharp and piercing like a blade.</p>
<p>With the heart of a traveler longing for home, I walked with hurried steps, quietly disappearing into the giant shadow. The wind, whistling sharply, accompanied by the dull raindrops, tracked the thin figures of people, shooting horizontally like random bullets.</p>
<p>Touching my gray and worn clothes, they were already soaked; my dilapidated felt hat was also soaked, and I felt a burst of cold on my head.</p>
<p>The street scene was bleak and fishy, and the dim electric lights were trembling slightly, as if they were mute.</p>
<p>"Ah! Sleeping metropolis, the heavy heart of the traveler."</p>
<p>The street. Vast like a silent giant snake, lying coldly. The sidewalks facing each other seemed to have a long distance. I was trying to cross from this side to that side with the greatest courage.</p>
<p>However, the rain was really too sharp, and the raindrops flew down from the sky like muffled thunder, cracking on the shiny asphalt road, becoming countless water droplets splashing around.</p>
<p>I ran, with the courage and heroism of a strong man; however, I had to retreat in frustration again when I was halfway there. I tried again and again, but only ended up disappointed and discouraged.</p>
<p>"This sharp rain, this whistling wind!"</p>
<p>Calculating the unfinished journey: the distant lodging; so, I began to worry.</p>
<p>—Friends! You may have comfortably found your lost hearts! We are all on the front line of struggle, but who understands? Here is a traveler who cannot return to his lodging.</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking, a wave of sentimentality swept down my heart like a storm.</p>
<p>As if hazy in the vortex of sentimentality, I wanted to cry heartily, letting all the melancholy be vented by tears! However, I had never done this. Like a ghost, I laughed hysterically instead.</p>
<p>"Laughter, a terrible sneer!"</p>
<p>The rain had slowed down a lot, and the wind had stopped its whistling.</p>
<p>Ahead, at the distant street corner, a beam of bright light was gleaming dimly, and it seemed to be accompanied by a low song, washing away this dull space:</p>
<p>"A cup of spicy wine,</p>
<p>A sword of shining light,</p>
<p>There were once attached the youth of people yesterday and today,</p>
<p>Traveler, traveler!</p>
<p>Cherish your precious youth!"</p>
<p>Looking up at the dark sky, I continued my journey.</p>
<h3>Coal Porters in the Rain</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Bean-sized raindrops fell incessantly, and many people and cars were speeding on the road. Among them, only a coal cart was slowly advancing in the rain like an ox.</p>
<p>Three people bent over to pull, and two pushed from behind. The faces of the five coal porters were all black like ghosts. The cry of "Ai He" came from their mouths, and there was a hidden sadness of life inside.</p>
<p>The heavy rain poured straight on them, and the blue cloth gowns were soaked tightly to their bodies. Sweat and raindrops fell to the ground together from their foreheads. I would not believe it if they did not get sick when they went back.</p>
<p>How many people rely on gas for happiness and survival, and how many people suffer in the rain to transport coal. Everyone's body is the same structure, why are there two kinds of inequality in life?</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>After finishing the Huaqing meeting in Ban Nian, he rented a bicycle to go to Da Jiao.</p>
<p>This was a coastal path, and the road was very rugged. The bicycle jumped on it, and you should always pay attention to the small holes and the ruts made by bicycles after the rain. The coconut groves flew by the side of the body, and the grass houses also slipped past the corner of the eye sparsely. It was very hard to ride a bicycle on this kind of road, but thinking that he would meet the daring and enthusiastic Mr. Guo again, and see the cause they were doing, he felt very happy in his heart.</p>
<p>The lonely Da Jiao City had arrived. I jumped off the car in front of a shop.</p>
<p>The one who met was Mr. Wu, but Mr. Guo was not seen.</p>
<p>Da Jiao City was very quiet in the daytime. The fishermen had all gone to the sea, and the stench of fish and shrimp penetrated deep into the nostrils everywhere, making people want to vomit and sneeze repeatedly. Flies were flying everywhere.</p>
<p>"Where is Mr. Guo?"</p>
<p>"He escaped to Singapore." Mr. Wu said softly in my ear, while glancing at the boss sitting at the counter.</p>
<p>He led me to the Youth Society.</p>
<p>The gray and desolate hall of the Youth Society surprised me slightly. Although this was a simple house built of wooden boards and Atap, a year ago, this was a gathering place for a group of young people, and also a noble club for fishermen. Under the leadership of Mr. Guo, the young people used their vigorous vitality and the fishermen's life energy to do a great cause in this lonely and remote seaside. Now, the hall was deserted, and cobwebs stained the plaque of the Youth Society.</p>
<p>"Since the Han Wu Si came here to inspect, Mr. Guo and our cause have encountered bad luck." Mr. Wu began to tell me.</p>
<p>"Oh!" I opened my mouth wide, and couldn't say a word for a while. Then he hesitated and continued: "Didn't you escape the eyes of the Han Wu Si?"</p>
<p>"That's right. We knew that the Han Wu Si's patrol was very planned. The reporter of the newspaper was punished, the teacher was suspended, the Chinese public organizations were dissolved,... Would our small Youth Society not be dissolved? We were indeed a little worried beforehand. However, young people are very resourceful. We moved away the books of the Three People's Principles and sociology and political science first, and invited Mr. Jia Bi Dan of this place to be a "shield". Thanks to Mr. Guo's proper response during the interrogation, and the protection of the old man Jia Bi Dan, the Youth Society was still able to exist." Mr. Wu took a breath. A glorious red light floated slightly on his face.</p>
<p>At this time, the Hainanese shop assistant brought in two cups of hot Java coffee. After taking a sip of the coffee, Mr. Wu's happy mood sank down.</p>
<p>He continued,</p>
<p>"I thought I could carry on the cause of the Youth Society. Unexpectedly, the Ban Nian government, under the instructions of the Han Wu Si, sent spies to monitor us at any time; and this group of rough men who caught fish and shrimp actually played the trick of striking under the recession. As a result, the bosses who supported the Youth Society earlier cursed the Youth Society, and Mr. Guo was considered a Feng Dong's role."</p>
<p>He took another sip of the strong coffee, and a cigarette was smoked in his mouth. My heart also gradually jumped up.</p>
<p>"What happened after that?" I asked anxiously. Wiping a handful of sweat for Mr. Guo.</p>
<p>"We quickly sought a buffer method from the tense atmosphere. On the one hand, we asked the fishermen to slow down, and on the other hand, we proposed to the Ban Nian government to let us help the government to slightly tidy up the avenue from here to Ban Nian, and complete a better road."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu smoked the cigarette vigorously again. I saw that he contained a burst of fire in his heart.</p>
<p>"In this way, although the colonial government felt a slight joy for our group of dedicated people, the bosses regarded Mr. Guo as a thorn in their side, and regarded the Youth Society as an organ for young people to make trouble for the old people."</p>
<p>"Hey!" I couldn't help sighing.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu lowered his voice even more and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Guo has added a debt to himself because of this! He lost two thousand yuan in the shop he was working in. With his position in the shop, it didn't matter at all. But the bosses took this opportunity to force our boss to file a complaint with the government, preparing to throw Mr. Guo into prison all at once."</p>
<p>When the narration reached the critical moment, Mr. Wu's posture of sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes became more and more vigorous, as if he wanted to swallow the whole world in one gulp.</p>
<p>Knowing that the situation was not good, Mr. Guo quickly set off. In the night, Mr. Guo escaped from a small sampan, preparing to take a boat from here to Ba Yan, and then cross the Strait of Malacca by fishing boat and return to Singapore."</p>
<p>The story was over, and the tense mood gradually dissipated between the two people. I didn't need to listen anymore after that; Mr. Guo must have gone to Singapore from here, and now he has become a wandering unemployed person again!</p>
<p>"It's a pity that when he left," Mr. Wu added: "He didn't have a single copper plate. The travel expenses were all collected by us. Soon after he left, the maiden-style strike failed to yield. Since then, the members of the Youth Society have scattered in all directions, and now there is an empty house left. In a few days, the owner of the house will rent it to a Malay to open a coffee shop."</p>
<p>"Oh!" I couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>Soon I said goodbye to Mr. Wu. I said I was going to another place.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Youth Society, the mouth of the Ban Nian River connecting the sea was appearing in front of my eyes. The tide was hitting the lonely coast. In the fishing area of Da Jiao, the sparse and scattered houses were gray in the approaching evening weather. The stench of fish and shrimp awakened my head.</p>
<p>Seeing the fishing boats returning one after another, the fishermen showed extreme fatigue after work, and I couldn't help but secretly wish in my heart:</p>
<p>"Poor overlords of Da Jiao! Let an era raise your heads!"</p>
<p>And then towards the southeast;</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Guo, I wish a bright life will come upon you again!"</p>
<p>After shaking hands with Mr. Wu to say goodbye, I rode my bicycle back to Ban Nian again.</p>
<h3>"The Sea Will Never Have Waves"</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>In the dark night of late winter, the South China Sea was blowing such a violent wind, and the frightening sound of the waves was rustling incessantly. The boat entered Guanghai Bay, and took a barge and floated on the silver-white waves to the bay.</p>
<p>The next morning, the sun shone on everything in the small coastal city shyly, and my friend pulled me to roam the peaks. The noble cat-shaped peaks stood on the edge of the concave bay. The huge, craggy mountain stones were layered on top of each other. There was a large stone about three feet high there, with the four characters "The Sea Will Never Have Waves" engraved on it, old and vigorous. According to legend, a long time ago, a "Holy Master ×" who was begging and wandering in the South China Sea almost capsized in the giant waves when crossing Guanghai Bay. Therefore, he engraved these words on the peaks. Since then, there have been very few storms outside Guanghai Bay. This is a myth, but the scenic spots here are also very famous in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Looking at the bay coast from the peaks, the tide receded in the morning, and the beach stretched more than a mile out to sea. At that time, the fishermen carried baskets of fresh fish ashore. This is the richest place for fish production in the south. However, the long street on Guanghai Bay seemed very depressed, because a few years ago, five thousand bandits were entrenched here, causing turmoil in the whole province. Large armies, planes, and warships were mobilized to encircle and suppress them. After a whole month, it quieted down. The wounds of the war are still deeply evident in the lives of the people.</p>
<h3>Toward Evening (17)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Only the new literary figure was still taking a bath in the bathroom, rinsing and splashing.</p>
<p>"When I was in Japan, I took a bath twice a day." Thinking: "However, Chinese people don't take baths. Therefore, Chinese people are good at preserving the dirt on their bodies, so the thighs must be washed white. Only when the dirt on the body is removed can the external things be preserved, and the singers can also attract audiences and arouse the audience's appreciation!"</p>
<p>This was the final conclusion that the new literary figure came to.</p>
<p>As soon as the literary thought was constructed, the body felt comfortable inside and out. He wiped his body with a dry cloth again. The new literary figure opened the door of the bathroom leisurely and walked out.</p>
<p>But a different batch of characters had been changed in the room. They were all neatly dressed in dark black uniforms. Perhaps the order maintainer who dispersed the road inspector for him on Xin Sheng Road was also wearing it.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Hu Yiyuan?" One of those people came forward politely to greet him. "Is Dahai Company opened by you? But! You forged lottery tickets for the flood disaster. We have already found evidence. Please go to our bureau tonight!"</p>
<p>A dream fell on Mr. Guo Ren. He really had eyes but didn't recognize Mount Tai, and he didn't even recognize the new literary figure who had said ten thousand words. However, Mr. Guo Ren couldn't speak, not only couldn't speak, but also forgot all about the bathing and saving the country theory he had just wanted to write.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Ren was taken away. On the road, he was faintly awakened by the hot wind of the summer night. Mr. Guo Ren remembered a vague word that Hu Yiyuan said to his uncle. So the entire Hankou Market was in front of his eyes: the uneven Sanxin Street? Dozens of smoking houses in a row, the road inspectors like bees in the case, the wandering souls at the bottom of the trash can, the black water hoop on the wall of Dahai Company, the silver building boss with a very prosperous belly, the female commander, the Austrian bug class, the red-bottomed and white-dotted head of the literary figure: even the bathroom... the great flood of the twenty-first year and the theory of bathing and saving the country...</p>
<p>"The brush in Japan!" Ten thousand Guo Ren Mr. was filled with emotion. (End)</p>

<h3>Hundred Thousand Gold Banquet</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Member of the Japanese House of Peers, Okawa Heisaburo, suffered from cholelithiasis that worsened last June, and his life was in danger for a time. He has now fully recovered. Okawa is the owner of more than 60 large companies. Last night, he hosted more than 800 celebrities from the government and the public at the Imperial Hotel to hold a banquet. The cost was 100,000 yuan. In today's world of economic recession, Okawa spent 100,000 gold to set up a one-night banquet, which can be called the king of banquets.</p>
<p>Japanese Councilor Okawa spent 100,000 gold to set up a one-night banquet, which truly set the highest record for a world banquet. According to Okawa's extravagance, his intention is nothing more than: last year, his old illness relapsed and he was in a state of near death. Now, he is fortunate to have the blessing of heaven and was able to turn danger into safety, so he held a grand banquet to celebrate. In addition, Okawa is a Japanese billionaire, or because of a disease last year, he realized in a state of confusion that money in the world "cannot be brought in life, and cannot be taken in death", so this time he spent 100,000 gold without any hesitation!</p>
<p>Some people want to regret him for Okawa's extravagance, saying that he should not spend money like dirt. In fact, this is not necessary. You only need to see that he is the owner of more than 60 large companies in Japan to imagine how rich his property is! What is 100,000 gold in Okawa's eyes? We usually often criticize the rich for not trying their best to exploit, turning copper coins into dimes and dimes into silver dollars, creating the phenomenon of uneven wealth in society, and at the same time ridicule them for not knowing how to cherish money and spending it excessively. How contradictory is this!</p>
<p>To be honest, we want to hope that there are no rich people who get something for nothing in society. Not only do we not need to plan for the rich and advise him not to waste money, but we should also vigorously encourage him to use money. If the rich people in society all become misers and regard money as life, not daring to kill a copper coin, the wealth of society will always be the private property of a few people. If we want to hope that the wealth of society is not concentrated in the pockets of a few wealthy people, we need extravagant people like Okawa in Japan who spend money like dirt. For example, if Okawa is not willing to spend 100,000, wouldn't this 100,000 gold still be Tai Chuan's private property? Now that he has spent this huge amount of money, society has increased by 100,000 gold that can circulate. In this way, the wealth of society can be distributed in all directions.</p>
<p>But there is still a problem. Although it is very reasonable to encourage the rich to waste money, can you guarantee that the rich will not step up their exploitation while spending money like dirt to meet the needs of their desires? This is also very worthy of consideration!</p>
<h3>Remembering the Foreign Land</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Remembering when I was young, I often heard my elderly grandmother tell stories of people in the village getting rich in "foreign lands", like what happened to so-and-so next door. At first, he left home with nothing but his bare body. In a few years, he brought back a woman with dark skin and a braid behind her head, wearing strange clothes, and rows of boxes that no one knew whether they contained gold or silver. They followed back gloriously.</p>
<p>That kind of woman is usually called a "foreign wife." —</p>
<p>Foreign wives are all rich, and only lucky people can get a "foreign wife," people were saying enviously.</p>
<p>Also containing a kind of admiration, the old grandfather quietly listened, and then couldn't help but ask:</p>
<p>—Why doesn't Dad go "overseas"?</p>
<p>—Dad has been there before, but he couldn't adapt to the climate and finally came back.</p>
<p>The number of people who left their homes and villages to go "overseas" was increasing day by day, especially those who couldn't stand in their hometowns. Needless to say, they immediately changed their minds and ran eagerly. Although they had to cross the long and distant sea journey and suffer all kinds of hardships or obstacles on the sea journey, no one showed the slightest retreat or fear. They said they would go, simply, resolutely, without hesitation.</p>
<p>The burning desire in the chest completely buried all the worries and concerns in reality.</p>
<p>As if they were going there to pick up gold, they mustered the greatest strength.</p>
<p>When women heard that their men were going, they would reluctantly try to stop them:</p>
<p>——Don't go, crossing the sea and ocean is so hard, it's always better to be safe in your hometown.</p>
<p>Stop gossiping, there are good days over there, could it be that we're starving our bellies here, just watching how to get through the day? If I go, I will eventually send money home.</p>
<p>Thinking of good days, everyone was of one mind! So they let him go.</p>
<p>At that time, the "foreign land" was probably truly an invisible land of gold, a paradise full of happiness and joy. It flickered with red, pleasing light in the minds of ordinary people, and it did turn the dreams of many people into the fruits of reality. Although not everyone who went there would get a "foreign wife," suddenly make a fortune and have a status, but at least they would have enough to eat and live on, and they could also send some surplus money back to support their families.</p>
<p>The "foreign land" became the last way out for people who had nowhere to go, and at the same time a great turning point to change the color of their lives.</p>
<p>There was a time when the "foreign land" made people plant boundless beautiful fantasies in their hearts in this way, and it had also repaid the beautiful fantasies of quite a few people. Afterwards, although the number of people who went continued to increase, the situation gradually changed.</p>
<p>Although the number of people who went was increasing, the number of people who hit a wall and turned back was more than the number who went. For some reason, people who had only been gone for a short time returned in droves, all dejected. Even "old overseas guests" who had stayed for almost half of their lives for ten or twenty years also returned to their completely unfamiliar hometowns eagerly.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>——Alas, the market situation is difficult, business is not easy to do, stores are closing every day, how can this world be like this.</p>
<p>The returnees all said with sighs, and then they would tell you what you wanted to know with a sad face: what stores laid off employees and cut salaries, what good companies failed and committed suicide! All kinds of things about that side.</p>
<p>The last way out for people who had nowhere to go was also blocked by something. Did the beautiful dreams and beautiful ideas really become eternal dreams and eternal fantasies!</p>

<h3>Family of Scholars</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>After several letters back and forth, the final express letter to home decided to sell that old house. The letter said how your great-grandfather and grandfather diligently built the family fortune, and by your father's generation, he finally "rolled up his trouser legs," earning the reputation of a scholar. Who knew that now we'd be selling the old house to make a living!</p>
<p>According to my great-grandmother, when I was little, farmers were so worthless. Your great-grandmother couldn't stand the landlord's temper, so she decided that your grandfather should study and advance. But with only a few acres of land to farm for others, one couldn't have aspirations. With spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvest, and winter storage, how could one have time to study? At that time, the father and son tightened their belts and scrimped and saved so that your father could fulfill his wishes. You were lucky to be born later, able to swagger about without being called farmers by others!</p>
<p>That time was naturally the peak of our family's prosperity. My great-grandfather had already passed away, smiling as he took his last breath. Every day, my grandfather went to the teahouse with his pipe, wearing a blue gown and vest, receiving flattery and envy from many who hadn't yet rolled up their trouser legs. I, this fortunate descendant, was taught hundreds of characters by my father and sent to a private school.</p>
<p>That old house was renovated, and a screen wall was built in front of the door, said to show the status of a scholarly family. Inside the wall, a large lantern that was blown by the wind all year round hung at the gate. Courtyards, flower halls, and main halls were all imitated and rebuilt. In the center of the hall, a horizontal plaque with the words "Chongxun Hall" inscribed by a Juren (successful candidate in the imperial examinations) was hung. From then on, we were a family of scholars.</p>
<p>After two years in private school, I entered what was then called a "foreign school" after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. I, who should have been despised as a cowherd, was now called "young master." In my memory, the happiest time was that short period.</p>
<p>After climbing the ladder to complete elementary and higher elementary school, I entered middle school. What glory and pride that was! In our village, climbing from a farmer to a scholar was already famous far and wide, let alone entering a higher-level foreign school—it was almost like becoming a Juren in the old days! I remember that when I went to board at middle school in the county, the family specially prepared a sumptuous meal with several dishes on the night of packing my luggage, as if entertaining an important person. During the meal, my father recounted the great wishes of my great-grandfather and grandfather, finally hoping to place even greater gains on me. However, this gathering ended the fate of our family of scholars.</p>
<p>The warlords' ambitions stirred up long wars. Although the old house escaped disaster, it became a scarred and empty house. Then, my father died of illness. With tears in her eyes, my mother sold the fields to let me finish middle school. The fortunate young master shouldered the burden of the family and floated out.</p>
<p>This middle school graduate, who had a status like a Juren, only managed to support himself. But this was already a fortunate middle school graduate. Many others of similar status envied me, as they wore long robes and jackets and waited for opportunities. At home, my mother, younger siblings used the old method of selling land for food. My great-grandfather and grandfather in the ground probably regret exhausting their life's energy to climb to the status of a scholar, even though farmers were even more poor.</p>
<p>To this day, I can't even keep the old house passed down by my ancestors. In the last letter I received from home, I seemed to see the scene of the new owner fiercely forcing them out of the house. I couldn't help but shed tears on the letter. The fate of scholars! Ah, the fate...</p>
<h3>Pen Battles on Qipan Street</h3>
<p>— Yi'an</p>
<p>My Self-Introduction for Employment</p>

<h3>Discussion on Handwritten Characters</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Indeed! This is truly an unexpected thing! Those vulgar characters, long seen as worthless by men of letters and scholars, said to be unsuitable for refined society, have now become popular. Since the education authorities gave them the honorable title of "simplified characters" last year and vigorously promoted them, now more than two hundred celebrities have changed their name to the beautiful name of "handwritten characters," compiling a list and printing books for practical use. It seems that in the near future, these labor-saving and material-reducing vulgar characters may appear grandly in the writings of men of letters and scholars.</p>
<p>Is it worthwhile and necessary to promote handwritten characters? I am ashamed to say that I am not an expert in calligraphy and dare not make rash judgments. However, I feel that there is a very important prerequisite for promoting handwritten characters, which is: After handwritten characters are universally used, how will their original characters be dealt with? Will they be completely abolished? Or will they continue to exist as before?" There are two answers to this question. The first is of course "completely abolished," and the second is of course "continue to exist as before." Then, looking at these two extremely opposite answers, it is worth studying.</p>
<p>Let's first study the first answer!</p>
<p>(1) According to my country's dictionary, there are as many as tens of thousands of characters, and even those we use daily number in the thousands. However, there are very few characters with handwritten forms, at most only a few hundred. … For example, the handwritten characters selected in the first phase only number over three hundred, and almost all frequently written characters are included. … Now, if these hundreds of handwritten characters' original characters are abolished, it will indeed be convenient for elementary school students to write these hundreds of handwritten characters in the future. However, there are still countless characters with many strokes and no handwritten forms, so what should be done?</p>
<p>(2) The structure of traditional Chinese characters can be said to be dignified, square, and upright, without a single careless stroke. However, handwritten characters, due to the reduction of strokes, are much more casual in structure, and some even look like symbols or numbers. Now, if these nondescript handwritten characters are interspersed among traditional characters, they will look like Japanese writing, with some Japanese characters interspersed among many Chinese characters. Those who don't know will think that Chinese characters have also been assimilated with Japanese.</p>
<p>(3) Among the handwritten characters selected in the first phase, many themselves have other sounds and meanings, such as "象" (elephant), "龍" (dragon), "桔" (orange), and "才" (talent). Now, if the original characters they represent are abolished, then won't the sounds and meanings of these handwritten characters themselves and the sounds and meanings of the original characters they represent be confused and indistinguishable?</p>
<p>Let's study the second answer again!</p>
<p>According to the vulgar characters of the past, anyone who can write knows how to use them. No one has ever specifically</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>gone to study them. Now, in addition to the traditional characters, these handwritten characters are singled out and special books are printed. Then, when elementary school students enter school in the future, will they first recognize handwritten characters? Or will they recognize handwritten characters and their original characters together? If they first recognize handwritten characters and then recognize the original characters when they are older, this is no different from eating a meal in two sittings, making elementary school students spend more mental effort to recognize and remember. If handwritten characters and their original characters are recognized together, seeing a character with two ways of writing in the simple minds of elementary school students will definitely be confusing. Not only will this not be convenient, but it will also cause more trouble.</p>
<p>I have studied these two answers for dealing with the original characters for several days and cannot decide which one to adopt. Therefore, I am writing them out for the gentlemen who advocate handwritten characters to study. - Jian Xiao</p>
<p>Editor's note: We greatly admire Jian Xiao's enthusiasm for studying handwritten characters. However, he has somewhat misunderstood the meaning of the "character" itself, so he has thought of many irrelevant questions, which makes him have doubts about the future of handwritten characters.</p>
<p>We know that there must be many people who have the same questions as Jian Xiao at the beginning of these handwritten characters, so we specially open a public discussion. If readers have any opinions, please write to participate in the exploration of this issue.</p>
<p>"Writing" is just a symbol of language; it is a tool for recording human thought and various activities, and itself has no special meaning. We can use foreign languages to translate the meaning of ancient Chinese prose; at the same time, we can also use Chinese to record foreign history. Characters with many strokes and characters with simple structures both express meaning and are actually no different. Jian Xiao seems to very much approve of the upright and square form of regular script. He said that the structure of handwritten characters is too casual, nondescript, and like a number. This is where he misunderstands the meaning of writing. Because writing is originally a symbol, as long as it is usable and convenient, it does not have to be pretty or upright. And what is pretty or not is just a habit.</p>
<p>We know that Chinese writing was very complex and difficult to write in ancient times. For example, the pictographic character "馬" (horse) had to be drawn in the shape of a horse; wouldn't that be too inconvenient? Although the seal script had more of a standard, the winding and curved characters were also very difficult to write. Due to the people's need for simplicity, after a long period of improvement, the more convenient scripts such as clerical script, regular script, cursive script, and running script were gradually adopted.</p>
<p>We feel that the success and change of an event always have reasons that have been brewing for a long time. Its success is mostly due to the common needs of the masses, creating and accumulating together invisibly. And when it changes, it also comes from the requirements of the situation and the trend of the times, pouring down, and even great force cannot stop its progress.</p>
<p>Handwritten characters are inherently a simpler form of writing that the public needs. However, in the past, due to the traditional concepts of general intellectuals, they have not paid attention to these "vulgar characters" that are not suitable for refined society. But in fact, their convenience in writing and their relationship to promoting mass culture are very great. For example, compared to the regular script characters "擔" (carry), "鬭" (fight), "灑" (sprinkle), and "喫" (eat), the handwritten characters "担" (carry), "鬥" (fight), "洒" (sprinkle), and "吃" (eat) have the same meaning, and everyone recognizes them when they are written. Then, why don't we abandon the complicated and choose the simple? Are we willing to spend more time writing characters with complicated strokes? Or do we write handwritten characters that save effort? We can say with certainty that most people will write for convenience.</p>
<p>Because of the actual needs, we can predict that handwritten characters will definitely become popular throughout the country in the near future. You see: On the government side, the Ministry of Education has hired calligraphy experts to plan the promotion of this script, and future textbooks will undoubtedly adopt handwritten characters as much as possible. On the people's side, most intellectuals are actively promoting them, and there is an organization called the "Handwritten Character Promotion Association." Some items have already implemented the use of handwritten characters and have even cast them into type.</p>
<p>This enthusiastic expression of sentiment further proves the value of handwritten characters. Jian Xiao asked: "After handwritten characters are universally used, will their original characters be completely abolished? Or will they continue to exist as before?"</p>
<p>This is not a problem. After handwritten characters become common, the original characters will gradually be eliminated, abolished naturally without being abolished. We open a "Kangxi Dictionary," and there are many complex ancient characters inside, but do people still use them now? People have already switched to simplified characters from ancient characters. Because it's more convenient! These handwritten characters are simplified characters of simplified characters of ancient characters. Their future is of course smooth. We hope that in the future there will be characters that are easier to learn, easier to write, and easier to read than these!</p>

<p>The Prince of Yan is unprincipled, yet occupies the Prime Minister's seat, while Emperor Jianwen flees to another place. Monarch and ministers hide their tracks like Yi and Dao, sadly packing the great emperor's mountains and rivers into a single burden. Exhausting themselves on steep mountain ridges, crossing winding and long rivers, indifferent to cold clouds and miserable mists, the bitter rain and chilly wind bring complaints. Who knows that I forced my way to Xiangyang, and saw the heads of loyal ministers loaded in the carriage, how could one not break one's heart. What crime did Qu Qinxiao commit to be caught in the net, those officials who should have retired are all employed. Thinking of scholars suffering through cold windows, today they know the tragic ending. Cleverness is often ruined by cleverness, don't let your children and grandchildren go to the examination hall, serving the emperor is like a sheep accompanying a tiger, not cultivating and guarding the fields. Crossing remote and traversing thousands of mountains and ten thousand waters, not knowing when we will return to the capital, the most tragic is the evening temple bell awakening the scene of Jingyang.</p>

<p>It is especially important to know that nothing is not constant, and nothing is not centered. The matter of a virtuous tutor, as viewed by the masses, is considered strange and lofty. However, as viewed by Yao and Shun, it is seen as constant and not strange, centered and not lofty. Lifting a cauldron of ten thousand jun is common for Wuhuo, but others consider it brave. Swimming in a thousand-ren abyss is common for divers, but others consider it divine. To imitate Yao and Shun without having seen them is like a coward lifting Wuhuo's cauldron or a child entering a diver's abyss. How can one not fail?</p>

Fortunately, she resolutely loved, even protesting hunger strike and tears to show her determination, resisting blind superstitions, etc. As a result, her mother could not demonstrate and a marriage contract was formed. Both felt at ease in their old professions, with their love supported. Later, Jingyi's mother fell ill, Mengdi was righteous, often came home to serve, causing her to neglect her studies. One evening, when questioned and slightly criticized, she became resentful. Fortunately, his parents comforted and calmed things down. After many months of peace, unexpectedly he was assigned to serve in another port.

<h3>The Result of Robert Montgomery's Fifteen Years of Diligent Study</h3>
<p>When you stand up to speak, do others laugh at you? When attending a class reunion or social gathering, do you have the ability to speak on stage and earn everyone's applause? Does your face turn red when the chairman suddenly says, "Now, let's invite Mr. So-and-so to say a few words to us"? Or, in casual conversations among friends, do people chat and laugh merrily, everyone listening with great interest, but when you want to speak, no one pays attention, or someone interrupts with another topic, preventing you from finishing what you want to say?</p>
<p>If you are such a timid speaker, don't be afraid. Your problem is not hopeless. You can still learn a skill that will make people want to listen to you speak. Because many people were like you, but they overcame their problems. You can also overcome your problems. The suave and eloquent leading man you admire on the screen, Robert Montgomery, is one of them.</p>
<p>But Montgomery said, "I spent fifteen years of hard work learning this speaking skill, and the only way to learn to speak is to speak often."</p>
<p>You must be accustomed to seeing Robert Montgomery on the screen. His suave and natural, witty and humorous attitude makes you admire him involuntarily. You would very much like to be such a person yourself, but you think that what you want is ultimately a luxury, because you feel that Montgomery's suave and natural attitude is innate and cannot be learned. But you are wrong!</p>
<p>His suave and natural attitude is not innate, but the result of fifteen years of effort to improve himself. Of course, when you talk to him face to face, his eloquence will certainly not disappoint you. You will never find him to be a dull person. But what you don't know is that his efforts are no easier than those of ordinary people or your efforts.</p>
<p>"When I was in school," Montgomery said, "I always envied a group of classmates who were good at talking. I always found it strange that they spoke and laughed, without any hesitation or fear in front of acquaintances or strangers. As for me, I was a naturally tongue-tied person. I often heard people's clever words, remembered them in my heart, or prepared many witty remarks to say tomorrow at night. But when the opportunity to speak came tomorrow, my tongue would become stubborn again. This caused me deep pain. Although I was a good athlete, because I didn't talk much, people didn't interact with me much. When people talked, I could only stand by and listen quietly. If you have also experienced this, you will understand the pain I often felt." The above is what Montgomery said about his childhood.</p>
<p>"When I left school life and started my career, the difficulties I had to overcome were no less than those of others. Although I didn't have any physical shortcomings, I didn't know anything at that time that I should have known. My timidity was probably something I couldn't avoid in my life. When I first started looking for work at the New York Drama Company, I would wait in the reception room for five minutes, waiting for the female secretary to go back to report to the manager, but no matter what, I would never wait for six minutes. I waited for five minutes and then ran away. The theater managers either said that I was too independent or that I had a strange temper. They didn't know that I ran away because I was afraid.</p>
<p>"Now, not only am I afraid, but I am also apprehensive. That nonchalant, at-ease appearance, from morning to night, is worn like a mask, but I am always afraid that if I can't wear it one day, what will happen? But I put on that mask every day, just like putting on clothes every morning. Of course, this is all a defensive work. I am afraid that if I am an actor for one day, this defensive work cannot be abandoned for one day. But if I can make the public think that I am a person who is leisurely in action, fluent in response, and sharp in speech, I think anyone can do it, as long as he works as hard as I do."</p>
<p>From the above conversation with Montgomery, the lesson learned is that a person must work hard and overcome the difficulties in front of him. Those who cannot speak must learn to speak, as long as they practice speaking often. Robert Montgomery has never refused a role that a director has asked him to play. He is known for being able to do anything. But when he is open and honest, he admits that he is not omnipotent, but only has the perseverance to learn and work hard at any time.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>### Review of "Desirable" (風流的母女)</h3>
<p>— Ling He (凌鶴)</p>
<p>Desirable – Cathay (國泰)</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that I do not feel any significant interest in the story of this film. Like the currently popular American films, this work is always a depiction of love entanglements, and it seems that there is nothing commendable other than unprincipled love entanglements.</p>
<p>In some love entanglement films, we still feel a faint touch of human sentiment, such as King Vidor's "The Prodigal," and Jean Muir's earlier starring in "A Woman Rebels," etc. However, here, we are not given even such things. This is a romantic tragicomedy that completely wins with its tortuous plot.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will feel satisfied. For example, Louise falls in love with the noble young Russell, but the innocent girl cannot stand the restraints of the noble family, such as the noble lady dislikes her parents' lowly occupation, such as the noble lady forbids her to talk to the maid, such as the noble lady blames her for going out with men, etc. These can arouse people's disgust for hypocritical etiquette, and then hatred and contempt for the magnificent family. But who did the girl marry after all? She marries Stan, who is much older than her, and Stan is the one her mother is interested in. Thus, the love conflict between the mother and daughter becomes the most exciting part of this film!</p>
<p>But like Capra's "It Happened One Night," which was shown in the same theater last time, this film has extremely skillful performance techniques to watch under vulgar ideas: on the one hand, what we cannot but admire is the acting skills of the female lead, Jean Muir. She was a woman who was older and deeply understood the ways of the world in "A Woman Rebels." She was hardworking and frugal, and she was content with a simple rural life. There, due to the success of her acting skills, the entire work was greatly enhanced. Now, in this film, she is a girl who is only nineteen years old. This is not only the cleverness of makeup, but more importantly, she very realistically portrays the innocence of a city girl. It is no exaggeration to say that her movements are very skillful, she has full emotions in every scene, even a small action is neither insufficient nor excessive, completely very skilled and calmly playing the role, it can be described as perfect. If it is only to appreciate acting skills, this film is worthy of people's attention.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what we want to say is the director's method. Every scene, every camera angle, and every composition of the screen is almost impeccable and very dutiful. Of course, we don't have to exaggerate and say that this film is a great success in directing, because the mediocrity of the story means that a good director has no way to promote it; then what is done here is only dutiful, expressing what the content contains, which is at least what we can admit. But a film can never be determined by the success of technology. On the contrary, skilled techniques expressing empty content are ultimately just skilled craftsmen; for example, the gorgeous colorful clothes on a paper figure can never turn the paper figure into a great hero!</p>
<h3>### Review of "The Firebird" (少女的煩悶)</h3>
<p>— You Jing (尤兢)</p>
<p>Firebird - Da Guangming (大光明映)</p>
<p>Among the many detective films that are empty in content, have to flow into meaningless interludes, nonsensical slapstick, and even unprincipled exaggeration and laying out insufficiently clever suspense, this "The Firebird" is relatively good. What a pity is that the original author's intention was not to write a detective drama, but to express a beautiful girl's resistance to the old family that bound her freedom and suppressed her and lost the meaning of life, and at the same time, the tragedy of naturally loving her parents. This is at the beginning when the girl Mary did not feel interested in her aristocratic, old life - such as secretly going to see the actors even in the extremely lively family dance, etc. - the middle recklessly interacted with the actor Byron, which led to a murder tragedy, the confession to her parents, and finally declared that she hoped to live her own life, to live for her own life. These are expressed very clearly.</p>
<p>What is going on with a more meaningful work that describes the human tragedy under the suppression of aristocratic old families and old systems, and forms something that is only different from mediocre and vulgar detective films? This is all because the adapter and director handled the loss of focus. After not deeply writing about the girl Mary's family and inner life, they let go of the individual depictions of her mother and the actor Byron, and only wrote some of Byron's pursuit of Boling and the latter's reaction in a superficial, fragmented, and chaotic way. Here, we almost only see the two people pulling each other back and forth. As for how Mary, who is the main key to the murder case, was suffocated by her family to blindly love Byron, how she fell in love with him, it can be said that there was no proper arrangement at all. When the case unfolds, although it is emphasized that each actor in the play tries his best to act, it can no longer give people a strong and unified impression. Moreover, because the middle part of the play is too emphasized in the process of investigating the case, the ending of the girl's demand for freedom and the call for her own life is also weakened with the strength of the crossbow at the end of its flight. The reason why the producers did not pay much attention to the relationship between Mary and Byron was nothing more than to take care of the general techniques of detective films, the so-called wanting to catch and let go, so that when the case is clarified, the audience can suddenly understand. Unexpectedly, there is a lot of drama in the rapid turn downwards, and there is no way to look back as there is plenty of time in general detective films, so they have to use dialogue to make the plot tense, especially the emotional components are very strong, so that the viewer has no time to look back and jump through. As for Mary's mother falsely admitting that she is the murderer, although there is a lot of drama to do in the ups and downs of the case, it is too contrived from the plot and human relationships. From the perspective of acting, each actor here has a commendable performance. Fan Liti Steer's mother Boling, Annie Tai Luis's daughter Mary, Lyon Yade Wei's father, and Arboli Smith's detective all have considerable achievements, but Ricardo Koudan, who plays the lustful actor, gives people a weaker impression because the producers failed to allow him to develop his personality.</p>
<h3>Brief Introduction of the Two Stars in Tolstoy's Immortal Work "Resurrection"</h3>
<p>This is the second literary creation of the American producer Goldwyn since he discovered the Soviet genius Anna Sten. The protagonist of the French literary giant Zola's outstanding work "Nana," which caused a sensation last year, is now playing Katusha in Tolstoy's book. Goldwyn also recruited Frederic March to play Prince Dmitri. Imagine having such an immortal love drama script, plus such a perfect match of geniuses, plus the extraordinary skills of Mac Mamoulian, who is regarded as one of the world's eight great directors. Of course, this "Resurrection" is not only a new blossoming of literary and artistic flowers, but also a revival of the eighth art. According to the "Resurrection" in the silent film era, it was the greatest work starring Doris Darielle. And Lupe Levez's performance in the sound film did not see any success. So this is the third filming.</p>
<p>Anna Sten. Anna is from Kiev, Russia. Her father founded a dance academy, but he passed away when Anna was twelve years old. The family was hungry and cold, so Anna lived the life of an extra with other poor children. After all, talent cannot be buried forever. She reaped her first harvest from Holman's drama and was sent to the film academy to study. Finally, after visiting Moscow in 1928, she played a supporting role in the world-famous "Yellow Ticket" film. Later, the Soviet government sent her to work in Berlin. She rose to fame in Germany and co-starred in "Tempest" with Emile Jannings. Soon, Goldwyn hired her to the United States and became a red star in Hollywood today. Anna's beautiful and healthy body fully represents oriental beauty. She has golden hair and blue-brown eyes. She usually doesn't talk much.</p>
<p>Frederic March. March was born on August 31 in Racine, Wisconsin. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin, he worked at a bank in the state. But his acting talent won him a contract with Paramount. He has won many victories on the screen and has been awarded the gold medal by the Academy of the Eighth Art. His famous films include "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "The Story of Temple Drake," and "Merrily We Go to Hell." Since he belonged to the Thirtieth Century Corporation, his first work was "Design for Living." Rice Merchant Mei will borrow him to play Blandning in "We Live Again." Now Goldwyn also borrowed him to co-star in "Resurrection" with Anna Sten. March is six feet tall and weighs 170 pounds. He has brown hair and eyes. He is also a highly skilled tennis player.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Wellington (The Iron Duke) (3)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi (信之)</p>
<p>In the Tuileries Palace in Paris, King Louis sat ponderously on the throne, his foolish face revealing bewilderment and shock. Around him stood Talleyrand, the King's brother, Duke Adolphe, and many courtiers. King Louis argued, "Good brother, I have said that we don't need to make such a fuss." Duke Adolphe became even more anxious and said, "But I must beg Your Majesty... You should still listen to the advice of your military advisors." Louis said angrily, "I am not afraid of that Corsican little rascal, shameless murderer." Although he said this, he was inevitably uneasy in his heart. He knew that he was timid, but he liked to put on a show to embolden himself.</p>
<p>Among the courtiers stood a man who had led Napoleon's elite troops and won many battles. That man was Marshal Ney. King Louis looked at him and said, "Marshal Ney, why don't you speak? You must know a lot. Didn't you fight against us with Napoleon before?" Marshal Ney said, "I advise you to retreat to Ghent." Louis was furious when he heard this and said to a courtier, "Go and call my niece. Tell her that I am waiting for her advice."</p>
<p>After a while, the Duchess of Angoulême had arrived. She stood tall and walked slowly towards King Louis's throne. A smug smile appeared on her face. When she knelt down to kiss Louis's hand, Louis said, "Ah, my dear niece. I want to hear your advice first before deciding what to do. So many people are telling me to leave Paris."</p>
<p>The Duchess slowly stood up, glared at the people around Louis, and then sneered, "Huh... Could it be that the Bourbons are so easily driven away by others?" Marshal Ney said, "Haven't they been driven away by others before?" The Duchess said angrily, "That was Napoleon Bonaparte! Not a fugitive from Elba!" Louis said, "So, you agree not to go." The Duchess hummed and asked, "I guess this escape must have come from the Duke of Wellington, right?" Louis hurriedly admitted, "Yes." The Duchess said, "I guessed it long ago. He is here to intimidate us. He put you on the throne and treated you as a puppet. He hates the Bourbons, and we hate him too!"</p>
<p>Louis hurriedly defended, "No, no. He respects me very much. He called me the King of France because he wanted me to save France." The Duchess retorted, "Wellington himself wants to be the King of France. So you should quickly leave those Allied countries. You don't need them now. Could it be that a king of a country doesn't have his own arms?"</p>
<p>Her intense words made the people around King Louis uneasy. When she finished speaking, she turned back to Marshal Ney. At this time, Marshal Ney said, "Give me four thousand elite soldiers, and I will capture Napoleon alive and place him at your feet." The Duchess sighed, "Thank heaven, we still have some courage left." But Marshal Ney said, "I can do that, but there is one condition. You must leave Paris immediately." (To be continued)</p>
