<p>— 紀</p>
<p>據日前倫敦電訊。英美法意日五國政府業已商得同意。將各派財政代表來華。調查我國貨幣狀况。英法兩國人選。且已正式發表。美意日諸國代表。不久亦可派定。此事刻下雖尚待發展。其前途成效如何。未容吾人逆料。但中國經濟近受美國白銀政策之影響。呈極度不安之象。各國政府關懷及此。派遣代表來華。考察我國實情。以謀貢獻。姑無論其將來之手段若何。目的若何而此種國際間對我之同情。固值得吾人贊許者也。</p>
<p>世界經濟因資本主義高度發展之結果。早已形成一體。不可分離。一隅之安危。恒足以牽動大局。因之國際間爲謀和平利益之進展。其有賴于各方面之合作與互助。亦甚殷切。我國年來因經濟恐慌。形成百孔千瘡之狀態。固係事實。吾人雅不願諱疾忌醫。故國人對各國經濟考察團之來華。均表示相當之歡迎。誠以目下中國正在百端待理之秋。舉凡各種建設事項。皆有賴於列國物質上與技術上之援助也。惟「利用外力决非「依賴外力」之謂。貨幣爲一國經濟生活之中心。其影響於民族之獨立生存者甚大。决不能受他國之約束。目下列强恒。利用其金融政策。以統治各弱小民族國家。如美國之于古巴。英國之于瑞典挪威丹麥諸國。皆其顯例。設如外電所傳。各國代表皆欲將中國貨幣。納於自己勢力範圍之下。甯非含有爭奪遠東經濟領導權之意耶。</p>
<p>吾人以爲中國幣制之改革。其事至爲艱鉅。應竭全國上下之才智。熟審各方之利害。作精密之計劃。籌妥善之整理。决非「築室道謀」所可濟事。且中國旣爲獨立之國家。無論通貨如何改造。應有一獨立之通貨立塲。不宜與任何國家作貨幣之連繫。亦不宜受任何國家之利誘威脅。而苟且將事。否則中國在金融上恐將淪爲列强之殖民地。而國民經濟之自力繁榮。更戞乎其難矣。日前英國懷德爵士在倫敦發表一文。言「中國之生存惟有自恃其民族之力量」。斯言誠足令吾人深省也。</p>

<p>（一）德政府建議將來德國之海軍應佔英國海噸位之三成半已由英政府接受、英政府承認此項建議於將來限制海軍有電要之貢獻、並信自本日起生效之英德協定係兩國簽訂之最後協定、而利於各海軍國簽訂一般海軍條約、</p>
<p>（二）英政府後贊成德代表關於實行此項原則之宣言、此項宣言撮要如下、（甲）三成半之數爲永久性質之海軍比率、德海軍總噸位將如條約之規定、永不超過英帝國艦隊之三成半、將來如無明文限制此噸位、亦决不超過實際總噸位之三成半、</p>
<p>（乙）將來如成立一般海軍協定、而並未規定各國相對之海軍力、則德國不堅持將此項比率載入協定、惟以他國充份保障維持此項比率爲條件、</p>
<p>（丙）無論在何種環境之下、德國將保持三成半之比率、但他國如無限止擴充海軍攪亂過去之海軍均勢、則德政府備留邀請英政府考慮新局勢之權利、</p>
<p>（丁）德政府對於限止海軍主張劃分戰艦爲若干種類、並規定每種最大噸位及大砲最大口徑、與德政府接受各種戰艦二成半之比率、並願根據將來之一般海軍條約條改此項比率、將來如不能成立般海軍協定、則德政府變更三成半比率之權利、應由德英兩政府訂立雙方協定調整之、</p>
<p>（戊）他國如欲將巡洋艦及驅、艦併爲一類德國亦可照辦、惟德國主張將此種艦隻分類、</p>
<p>（已）至於潛艇、德國所有潛艇之總噸位應等於英國潛艇之總噸位、但决不超過英國海軍總噸位之三成半、德國因願限制其潛艇總噸位等於英國潛艇之四成半但遇緊急時保留超過四成半之權力、惟亦願事前與英政府談判此事、</p>

<p>（巴黎）英國駐法大使克拉克爵士今晨以英德海軍協定全文送呈總理兼外長賴伐爾、並報告賴氏、謂英國出席國聯之代表艾登將於星期五來法、與法政府討論歐洲般的及特殊的問題、賴伐爾對於艾登來法、當即表示歡迎、英大使離外部後賴伐爾卽與蘇俄大使作長談、據消息靈通方面稱、兩人亦談及英法海軍協定云、今晨報紙競載英德海軍協定、並有詳細之批評、國家主義派日報對於英　單獨與德談判、予一般會議及集體安全制以打擊、多所指摘稱、斯特萊柴陣終今已破裂、協定中規定之巨數德國潛艇尤於法國不利、法國不得不在與他國發生糾紛之情形之下、增加其海軍、該報對於意國獲得與法國海軍爭權均勢之新機會、表示遺憾、並發警告稱、德國艦隊之恢復將引起波羅的海之不安、英國何不爲大陸免除此項不安歟云、巴黎迥聲報國際電訊主筆波丁那亦嚴詞責詰英政府、並要求今後海軍談判應改在巴黎舉行、蓋英國漠視法國之利益法國不能再認英爲公斷人矣、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於倫敦英德兩國海軍談話之英國照會昨日業由法國政府答復、據聞內容大要如下、</p>
<p>（一）法國復文申說、海軍問題若與全部軍備問題分離、殊屬不宜、</p>
<p>（二）復文申說、二月二日英法兩國倫敦宣言書之目標、乃係在安全制度之範圍內將一切軍備問題通盤解决、</p>
<p>（三）法國不得不根據德國造艦計畫實行之速率、以確定今後海軍造艦計畫之標準、</p>
<p>（四）一旦蘇聯建造海軍、則德國　如何對付、對於此層亦要求加以說明、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）不管部閣員艾登、卽將前往巴黎、俾與法國政府進行談話、每日電聞報載稱、談話目標大約係下開四項、（一）德國曾向羅卡諾公約各簽字國提出牒文、謂法俄互助公約、實與羅卡諾公約所規定之義務相抵觸、當由各簽字國會同答復（二）關於天空羅卡諾公約之談判、在目前有否有促進之可能、（三）意國與阿比西尼之爭端欲謀和平解决、當採取何項新步驟、（四）多瑙河流域各國舉行安全會議問題、是否有進展、除此而外、艾登並將邀請法國海軍專家前來英國、以便籌備英法兩國海軍談話、屆時當由意俄兩國專家參加討論、至本年九月間國聯會大會與行政院舉行例會時、首相包爾溫並擬前往出席云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）不管部閣員艾登、定于星期五日赴巴黎、俾與法國政府討論海軍問題、英國亟欲向法國解釋英德海軍協定之確實結果、於此可見、英國人士因協定成立後、英德兩國不至再如一九一四年以前在北海方面從事海軍競爭、故甚爲滿意、關於潛水艇一節、一般人以爲英國雖元許德國潛艇與英國對等、但德國業已約定在平常時期、潛艇噸數不超過英國噸數百分之四十五、且潛艇噸數倘超過百分三十五之比率、則其他各級軍艦噸數勢必减少、且因此或足以阻止德國建造航空母艦云、至就國際方面而言、則英德海軍協定、已將德國重新納入集體安全制度之範圍內、故海軍協定與二月三日英法宣言書及斯德萊柴會議公報所倡導之政策、實並無相悖之處、此外意法兩國、對於英德海軍協定、雖有異議、但若將德國提議提交各國作普遍之討論則恐足以耽誤協定之成立、而使德國變更其原　之提議、至於將來法意兩國如變更海軍建造計畫、則德國亦未必能因此遽行增加海軍噸數、蓋德國若有增加海軍噸數之必要、則事前必須徵求英國之同意、此固白皮書所已載明者也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c38">法國政界之觀察　足促成空軍公約 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國政界人士以爲英德海軍協定足使天空公約之成立希望、感受影響、緣此　一般安全制度問題並無進展、而逕自單獨訂立海軍協定殊爲不宜也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德海軍協定成立之後、外間傳說德國首席代表里本特洛浦曾與不管部閣員艾登進行談話、並提議訂立天空協定、其內容當與海軍協定相同但一般人所能證實者、乃里本特洛浦與艾登所進行之談話、係關於海軍以外事件、非必天空公約問題、艾登頃定於星期五日前往巴黎屆時當將英德交換意見結果、通知法國內閣總理賴伐爾（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國家主義機關之民報今日論英法海軍協定、題爲「斯特萊柴精神之死亡」、大意謂英國今次奚落法意而使德國志得意滿之行動、實難索解、小報則謂此約爲德國一大勝利、足以强固希特勒在歐洲之地位、亦爲最嚴重之事端、足使英法關係發生極大之糾紛、小巴黎人報則謂、此約之意義卽表示德國之海軍力量永將弱於英國、故英國不惜出以最敏捷之手段、成就此出人意料之大好交易、故此約成後、英國內閣之地位亦愈見鞏固艾登來法之使命、似在向法人解釋英德海約突告成立之警惶、小日報謂、此雖爲希特勒之一大勝利、然亦爲英海部善攫機會以圖自利之成就、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）國會人士對于英德兩國海軍協定表示滿意、反對派以爲此　乃係以軍備完全平等權利給予德國之先聲、大多數議員亦引以爲幸、以爲英國海軍在北海所佔優勢、可因此而得保持至若干時期英國內閣亦因而在選舉策略上、得一良好口實、以爲制勝之具、然則下議院改選之期、亦且因而提早、實乃意中事也、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德海軍協定在原則上爲今後各報所歡迎、泰晤十報稱、雙方皆願成立諒解、故雙方皆　讓步、結果至少蛟一九一四年前更爲美滿云晨郵報稱、此項協定在若干方面上確爲美滿文件、但未有限制德國潛艇艦數與噸數之條文、英國行此步驟、並未預先商請海軍條約簽字國之同意云、每日電聞報稱、英政府如先將其意見通知法政府則爲得策、但此協定可爲將來更普遍的談判之基礎云、彙聞報稱、此項協定乃歷史中一大事、且爲　戰後德國參加軍備限制之第一文件云、每日驛報稱此協定大有助於軍縮與公共和平云、每日捷報稱、此協定乃英德不作海軍競爭之解、故可歡迎云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞報論英德海軍協定之重要性謂「德國重整軍備、歐洲暨遠東各國、擴充海軍之後、新局勢於以造成、而北海又復成爲軍略上之重要地點、凡此均足迫令英國變更海軍政策、目前英國保有潛艇四十五艘、卽五五·二四四噸迨至明年年底、卽有若干艘不復適用、此項噸位，亦將减至五二·七〇〇噸、若以百分之三十五計算之、則德國以建造潛艇可達一九·六三五噸之數、但現正建造之潛艇十二艘、各爲二百五十噸、不在此例、又據德國方面傳來消息該國在今後數年中、不擬建造嚴重八百噸以上之潛艇」云云（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 柏林通信</p>
<p>將來的德意志該向海上發展、是德前皇威廉第二要擴張海軍時的警語、也是歐戰以前德意志立國精神之一面、現在航空總長戈林將軍又高呌　德意志的命運是在空中、」他爲堅决表示其國家集團决心起見、實行在全國中學以上各學校、把「航空力學」列入主要課程、但單講「航空力學」、未免紙上談兵、不是德意志民族的素習、而且也不適於實用、因此將航空遊戲化、全國航空遊戲塲有三十所、沒有發動機的滑空機、（Glider德人李里恩塔發明的滑走機）有好幾千架、練習飛行術、學到滑空機操縱術的靑年有八千人、航空部將他們分作甲·乙·丙·三級、其中最高的丙級、技術可以和法關西相比賽的不下千人、將來這些靑年中必然有多數優秀飛行家出現、他們都會是德意志空軍的戰士、</p>
<p>德國現在設有二百六十個飛機塲、其中一百二十四處是普通商用的飛行塲、其餘都是軍用的、德國到底有多少飛機、其製造飛機的能力如何、至今還是不曾公表、據法國陸軍總長莫蘭將軍的估計、德國飛機工塲、每天能造十五架戰鬥機、又據蘇聯國防人民委員會副委員長杜哈其夫斯基估算、現時德國有三千七百架軍用飛機、飛行將校有八千人、飛行士有五萬二千人、此外選有六萬人正在受嚴格的飛行士訓練、據英國方面的估計、德國約有飛機一千七百架、其中六百架是練習機、其餘散在各地飛行塲中、極其秘密外人不容易窺知、尚一件值得注意的事、就是克虜伯製造廠的工人、增加到二萬五千人、究竟製造的是軍器·是軍需品·還是其他的東西、也是一個謎、法國自一九二八年成立航空部以來、卽竭力謀空軍的統一、除了海軍航空母艦所載飛機、及海軍協會所屬非艦載飛機以外、一律在航空部指揮之下組成巨大空軍、法國陸上空軍實力有偵察機四十八中隊、戰鬥機三十三中隊、爆炸機三十二中隊、氣球隊十八中隊、兵員約三萬一千人、現時陸上飛機總數約三千、到了戰時就會擴張到五千四百架、現在對民間飛行正在竭力提倡、航空部所屬部隊也要由現在的一百三十一中隊、擴大到一百五十六中隊、</p>
<p>就現勢而論、法國的空軍誠然居對德的絕對優勢、但是天然費源、並不怎樣豐富、「人的要素、比較德國更是劣勢、必須設法補充、挽回當前的頹運、因此法國的政治家·外交家·於德國漸次向上發展、退出國聯之後、聯合英國感着失望、對意大利又有若干矛盾、必不得已、才轉而拉蘇聯加入國聯、同時要他成爲法蘭西的與國、因爲蘇聯現在的戰鬥機、比四年前增加了三倍半飛行速力也增加了兩倍、戰鬥有效半徑增加了三倍、飛機數目雖不甚詳細、但多過二千架、其餘機械化部隊也不下於其他歐洲各國、不過法國參謀本部一般將梭還是服膺「戰備充實總是和平保障」這句話、所以盡量主張擴張充實自己的軍備、他們對於法蘇聯合的見解不甚以爲然、他們的意見、以爲在一九一四年當時、俄羅斯軍隊大敗於興登堡之手、從一九一七年革命到現在「軍的素質上、進步並不見得怎樣大、他們對於農業機械、還不能充分滿意操作、鐵道統制、也還不曾完成、建設空軍所不可缺的「人」的要紫也不甚具備、他們又以爲「俄國人先天是不滴宜於航空術的、」縱令他有三千多架飛機、其實　戰鬥力是要打折扣的、然而今日的法國、自己的實力、旣不能完全保持現狀、卽勉强支持、也不得不借助於蘇聯、一面擴充實力、纔能够保持對德的優勢、（五月十五日於柏林）</p>

<p>蠶種產額</p>
<p>本年春種爲便利種銷起見、准許各種塲以規定價格（每張四角）自由買賣、另由政府每張貼　二角至四角、（本年爲獎勵多絲量品種起見、除諸桂新桂與華五華六之正反交雜種、由政府張每貼補二角外、翰桂與華五華六之正反交雜種、每張貼補二角五分、西巧西洽與華五華六之正反交雜種、每　貼補三角、化桂與華六之正反交雜種、每張貼補四角）、蘇省產額、計春製者八十餘萬張、秋製者四十餘萬張、原係規定春製留省秋製輸出、乃於蘇建廳點檢蠶種時、發覺各種塲未能依照規定、不經呈准、將春製種之一部、亦復　出浙省、遂致輸浙之數達六十萬張、留蘇者僅六十萬張、自難敷用、當經蘇建廳分電輸出各塲及浙建廳扣留、惟以浙省催靑較早、需種甚殷、已有一部運出、且因浙省與各種塲成約在先幾經磋商、始獲扣留一萬張、此本年春種缺乏之主要原因也、四月中旬、天氣晴明、桑樹發育轉佳、蠶戶養蠶興趣頓濃、重以早春天氣驟暖、土種以保護不週、多數孵化、改良種之需要益增此六十三萬一千八百餘張之蠶種、其銷售旣不由政府統制管理、而由各塲委諸種販、自難得適當之分配、種販操奇居贏抬價漁利、剝削農民、深堪痛恨、政府爲救濟蠶農抑制抬價起見、不得已遂向日本訂購蠶種三萬一千餘張、運錫轉發各區銷售、以資調劑、惟以此舉頗不利於種販、致有五月二日搗毀蠶種現賣處之事、雖旋告平息、而核計全省缺少之蠶種、仍達五萬張左右）、爲改善蠶繭之品質起見、由蠶業改進管理委員會規定多絲量而强健之品種、指定飼育區域、以期鮮繭品質之劃一與烘折繅折之减低、其規定之品種爲一二化交雜種、一化性爲諸桂新桂翰桂化桂西巧西洽、二化性爲華五　六並絕對禁止純種及其他品種之詞育、</p>
<p>育蠶指導</p>
<p>今春蘇省設　　　者為無錫金壇二　、設改良一區者爲武進·江陰·宜興·溧陽·丹陽·吳縣·吳江·鎭江·句容·揚中·江都常熟·靖江·十三縣、一律採取中心指導制度、於區辦事處下視各縣蠶戶之分佈、設中心指導所、辦理蠶戶調查蠶室蠶具之消毒共同催靑稚蠶共育組織蠶業合作社等、復於中心指導區內分設育蠶指導所、指導蠶戶之育蠶栽桑等、以期育蠶技術之改進與經營之合理化、全省計設中心指導所三十八所、指導所二百六十八所、</p>
<p>繭行統制</p>
<p>蘇省自十七年開放繭行以來、灶數大增、鮮繭　量、遂不克與烘繭灶數相應、收繭費用、因而增加、二十三年春季起、卽實施繭行統制、俾繭行爲有秩序的營業、節約不必要之開支、改善烘繭之技術與收繭之組織、以期乾繭成本之减低與品質之增進、</p>
<p>本年春繭期、爲澈底實施繭行統制起見、第一步從事於繭行之整理、凡在模範區改良區各縣境內之繭行、由區查騐繭帖、共有帖無灶者、一律吊鉗其繭帖、有灶無帖者、折除其繭灶、其僅有單灶四乘或四乘以下之繭行、除確爲合作社之自用灶外、一律吊銷繭帖由會按其有效年限發還帖費、在繭行開秤半月前、由各區估計本屆之鮮繭產額、擬定准許開秤繭行之灶數、呈經蠶業改進管理委員會抆准公佈之、核准開秤灶數公佈後、卽開始辦理收繭商之登記、凡整理合格之繭行、一律均可招接收繭商、向各區登記、開秤收繭、其未登記者、一概不准開秤、如登記之灶數已達於核准開秤之灶數、卽行截止登配、但本屆未及辦理收繭商登記之合格各行、下屆仍得享受登記收繭之權利、爲掃除收繭　弊起見、並嚴禁使用舊秤、夜間收繭、取締繭販扒郎白拉及尾找小洋銅元等陋習、以保障蠶農之利益、</p>
<p>辦理結果</p>
<p>本年春期估計、全省約產鮮繭三十萬市担、改良種繭每市担扯價爲二十元、受指導繭戶每張改良種之收繭量、自三十市斤以至五十市斤以上、烘折自三百斤至二百七十斤、繅折自四百十斤至三百六十斤、以與去年相較、無不有顯著之進步、此無他蠶種之改進、品種之劃一、與育蠶技術之改善、有以致之、（註）去年改良種、每張之收繭量、約爲三十市斤至四十市斤、烘折自三百斤至二百八十斤、繅折自四百五十斤至四百斤、茲以蠶農每戶飼育改良種兩張計之、約可收鮮繭八十市斤、得價洋十六元、除去蠶種價八角、及養蠶所需之雜支約一元二角外、尚可獲利十四元、繭價雖低而蘇省災後之農民、得此收入、裨益良多、觀之繭市後各縣農業倉庫受抵物品之紛紛取贖、不難證明、抑有進者、以近年蘇省桑園之生產力計之、每畝桑園所生產之桑葉、約可飼育改良種兩張、照上述計算、卽每畝桑圍之投入、爲十四元（養蠶時問較短利　自　勞力已足、故養蠶之勞銀可不計）　　　之收入、尚未計入焉、若與稻田棉田比較、恐亦無多讓焉、是故蠶桑實爲營養農村之良好副業、今後茍能努力、於蠶品種之改進與劃一、以减低烘折與繅折、則絲價雖仍舊、而繭價仍可隨以上漲、是則有望於政府與社會之通力合作、以促進蠶業統制之成功也、</p>

<h3 id="c98">國貨業產銷均劇增　注意邊區推銷　開發海外市場 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>中央社云、國貨業年來經各界提倡　用後、產數與銷路、均見劇增、該業前途、大見光明茲悉該業爲謀積極推鈉起見、一方面注意邊陲省區銷售、一方面計及海外市塲之開發、據中央社記者向國貨業探悉各情如次、</p>
<p>出品產銷供求適合</p>
<p>疇昔國貨業廠家、對於貨品之山產、祗求成本低賤、易於銷售、致物質不堅、喪失購用者之信仰、遂使洋貨暢銷市塲、年來已漸思及對於貨品質料之選擇、力求精潔、故年來已漸見起色、但粗製濫造者仍未歛跡茲悉該業中各領袖、爲使增高購用國貨者信仰心起見、對於出貨一層决由同業中自相監視督促同時對於產數亦加以統制俾供求適合藉免存貨堆積、擱起成本、</p>
<p>推銷方面議定辦法</p>
<p>對於銷路方面、現正分頭計議、如何能使銷數之日增、其方法不一、現採用者、計（一）聯合各客帮、使貨品向內地推銷、（二）組織國貨宣傳團體、分赴內地展覽、使民衆明瞭國貨與外貨之分別、及國貨之價廉物美（三）分向內地較大城市設立國貨公司推銷等、其他推銷辦法、尚在計議進行中、務使全國同胞、都購用國貨、挽回利權、</p>
<p>內地民眾樂於購用</p>
<p>現在各地民眾、已各大國貨價廉物美、較勝於舶來品、故購用老亦逐漸增加、至邊陲省區、年來因外貨向內地傾銷故到處可見外貨、自國貨宣傳團體分往展覽後、增高該地民衆購用國貨心不少、故甘肅·陝西·山西·四川·雲南等省各大城市商界、已與本埠國貨界洽商推銷國貨辦法、已有數處、簽訂經銷合同、</p>
<p>積極進行推銷海外</p>
<p>國貨業年來對於海外推銷、亦在積極進行中、如南洋一帶、去年已由英人司派克氏、在滬選購大批國貨、專輪運往推銷、南洋一帶華僑、均表示歡迎、繼之者又有英人司密斯等、均能獲得鉅利、惟以各地進口稅過高、不無相當影響、國貨業中、以南洋一帶僑胞、已歡迎國貨、故將計議繼續運往銷售辦法云、</p>

<p>黃氏態度</p>
<p>關於黃氏今後之行動、據黃氏左右談、黃氏現在臂疾雖已稍痊、但尚未全愈、至於鼻疾則迄無良好進步、是故黃氏此來、决留滬繼續就醫、並檢騐身體、一、俟天氣稍熱、部將赴莫干山休養、對於內長之職何日履新、迄無確期、關於內部部務仍由陶許兩次長負責處理、</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>楊么事跡，宋鼎灃逸民所作，見於岳珂金佗稡編。朱希祖先生的考證本最近由商務印書館出版。朱希祖先生自序云：「當南宋高宗時，事有與今相似者，如黃河以北，淪於金虜；金又以山東河南陝西之地，立劉豫爲偽齊，建元阜員，一也。宋於淮漢大江之間，仿唐邊地藩鎭之法，設鎭撫使十餘，以爲屏藩，然紛紛割據，徒分兵力，或不奉號令，和五攻擊兼併，或降僞齊，借外力以內侵，二也。而鍾相楊么鼓吹均貧富之說，聚衆至四十萬，蔓延之地，水陸千里，三也。此皆可爲今之殷鑑。」朱希祖先生是有心人，他要於楊么事跡考證以外，另做僞齊國志及南宋初黨撫使考，「冀以窺見當時亂象之底蘊，」我們相信是很有意思的。</p>
<p>鍾相楊么主張，均貧富，等貴賤。」「均貧富」本來是儒家的主張，孔子說：「不患寡而患不均。」一提到土地分配問題，自董伸舒劉歆以後，沒有不夢想井田制的實現；直到明初，方孝孺還以主張復古井田被燕王棣用作攻擊建文帝的口號。自北魏均田制實行著有成績以後談土地改革的也大體都向着這條路走。均貧富的觀念，旣每人都有很深的印象；所以山民問揭等而起的，總有意無意之間，帶點「均貧富」的意味。如明末流寇李自成，大家都認作殺人不眨眼的壞蛋，但他的討明檄文，說：</p>
<p>「…茲爾明朝，久席太寗，浸弛網紀君非甚暗，孤立而煬蔽恒多；臣盡行私，比黨而公忠絕少。賂通官府，朝端之威福日移；利擅宗紳，間左之脂膏殆盡。肆昊天聿窮乎人愛，致逃民受苦於祲災。朕起布衣，目擊憔悴之形，身切痌濛之痛；念茲普大率土，咸罹困窮，詎忍易山燕水，未甦湯火？……」</p>
<p>這檄文，會忙懷了當時北京城裏許多士大夫，大家都來做闢謠的文章，說：「……（闖賊）盜仁義之虛聲，播强暴之事實。」鍾相，楊么的實行均貧富，比較有主張有辦法；他們的「焚官府城市寺觀神廟及豪右之家，殺官吏儒生僧道巫醫下祝之人。」（朱希祖先生謂：「其焚官府殺官吏，所以除邪法也；焚城市，所以除富商大賈也；焚豪右之家，所以除兼幷也；殺儒生，所以除論說邪法也；焚寺觀神廟，殺佾道巫聲下祝之人，所以反宗敎除坐食之人也；獨不殺農工，以皆自食其力，故鍾相之徒黨，春夏皆自耕耘。」解釋得極好。）也比李自成那樣發王邸金庫以賬與飢民，更能得人心。他們聚衆四十萬，縱橫千餘里，甫宋初年，朝廷費了極大的心力，由岳飛那些名將出爲，勝時十餘年，才算平定下來，也非偶然的。北魏行均田，楊么均貧富，要算儒家提倡井田制以來朝野兩個實行者，無論成功或失收，都是研究中國社會問題的極好借鏡。</p>
<p>「等貴賤之說，也有他的來源。農家許行主張堯舜與民並耕而食，惠施有去尊的主張，列子說子產的哥哥公孫朝好酒，弟弟公孫穆好色，比子產出治國還偉大，都有等貴賤的意味。西晋有鮑生主張「去君」，他說：「自從奪卑有叙，便有人造剡利之器，長侵割之患，弩恐不勁，甲恐不堅，矛恐不利，盾恐不厚。」又說：「人主憂慄於桎梏之間，百姓煎擾於困苦之中，正由君臣旣立，衆匿日滋。」「無君無臣，則不競不營。」他以爲廢了君，去了貴賤奪卑，則桀紂之徒，並爲匹夫，性雖兇奢，安得施之？」鍾相以爲法分貴賤，便不是善法，也就是鮑生之意。不過等貴賤看是容易，却比均貧富還難於實行。甚至，連主張等貴賤的鍾相楊么，也不能不自稱大聖天王，也是一個大矛盾。前些時，曾見鶴見祐輔主張指導地位的自然化，謂：「現今的一步的時代我們所可容認的指導云者，並非以一個人，來指導統率地上萬般的事相的人之謂。這是明明白白，是分了千百方面的，爲着特殊的目的而存在的指導者。在這意義上，即現代的每一個人，是草不具有各依天禀，可作別人的指導者的潛在能力的。……一到人文發達的極致，便極其自然尚然地，人類都成指導，也是被指導者。」那末，所謂「等貴賤一得着一種新的解釋了。</p>
<p>以上只能說是我的讀後感，關於考證部分，另外想再寫一點專門的文章。</p>
<h3 id="c173">「狂人」與我 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>對於人們含着一種惡意去招呼我的朋友阿金做狂人」這向事，在我的心中常常撩起一種劇烈的憤慨。我感覺：他們不但侮辱了阿金的火格，損害了阿金的生命，同時，我認爲侮辱了他，損害了他就等於侮辱及損害他的朋友無異。我便是我的朋友阿金的朋友當中一個。所以爲了這樁事，我感受到和阿金一樣的有切身之痛。對於他們那樣欺負他，虐待他，嘲弄他，和常常以那種不道德的舉動去對待他，我的腦袋憤怒得簡直要爆裂開來。由於這種事實上面看來，使找深刻地了解到他們內在生活的動向及那人間的悲慘底泉源。我確信：這是他們本性缺陷底特徵之一，每每感觸到這事上頭，使我不曉得怎樣去描畫人生的輸廓才行。</p>
<p>阿金是個性情異樣率直和堀强的人，他一向在地方法院裏做活。勞碌了大半生，他仍舊做個起碼的聽差。年紀快上五十歲了，可是他的身體還很壯健。他不但有做人的勇氣，幷且有做人的才能，他不但敢於說話，并且還勇於反抗。在這裏，他當常因爲爲著別人的事而和同伴吵鬧，他雖然在這裏的日子不少了。但他始終沒有向別人討過「枚」便宜一的錢。在他的面前倘若被他發現了什麽不平的事，如欺詐人家，壓迫人家，恐嚇人家，他就和你咆哮起來。在他的心中倘若認爲有必要帮助別人的事，那末，雖則如何的困難，他非得替人做到不可。總之，在他們中間，顯然他是一個奇特的人，他抱有一定的宗旨在這兒活着，他不怕與環境奮鬥。所以在這里，他很惹人厭，他們非常的憎惡他，因爲他妨碍了他們種種食汚的事。因此，他們認他作他們眼中釘，這一釘子」他們必得用子拔掉不成？果然，他終於被他們拔掉了。可是他不怕，他仍舊一樣地要生活下去，去做他的序下去，去講他的話下去。他到處去吶喊，喝吆相人家爭執。結果，他一樣地受着他們的憎惡。人們用一種輕蔑的眼光云瞅他，一樣地帶着惡意叫他是　狂人。一這件事，使我感覺到它本身的無即與殘酷。非人間的，充溢着一種世紀前那種野戀的腥嗅底氣味。我很替我的朋友傷心和爲憾。而我的良心敎找對於這事不能緘默，它在驅策着把。而我的理智同樣的在指揮五，使我對於這種一生的災禍底事，不能不積極起來！對於我的受難的朋友，對於我們的不幸的命運。因此，我便挺身而替我的朋友打抱不平，同樣的是爲我們的生存而抗議。我向人們解說，爲阿金辯護。想籍着我熱情及那種不可否定的理山去向他們抗議，務使他們了解到我的朋友幷不是像他們所謂「狂人」這類人。幷想狠狠地矛刺他們一下，暴露他們的點暗。然而我的努力沒有多大的效力，他們不但不聽，反而認我也是和阿金一樣是狂人。他們說：「一個好好的人怎會與狂人爲伍呢？」所以他們就斷定了我是狂人」。在我呢，不化與「狂人」阿金爲伍。幷目還爲他而奮鬥，而犧牲，在有必要的時候。如此他們對我更加恐懼與厭惡。首先仙們擯絕了我在他們中間的社會生活。再用種秈的手段陷害我，使我陷於阿金目前樣的境况而後已。我呢，在起初，心裏似乎感到一點楚痛和凄凉。原因是我的職業因此以落掉，我的飯碗因此被人敲碎，而我的「一般的一的朋友，也駭怕起我來，他們不敢接近我。生怕我的惡名會沾汚了他們的淸白。於是他們漸漸地離開了我，終於和找斷絕了一切友誼的關係。這點，當時很使我難堪。我會經這樣地憤恚對他們說過：「你們的腦子爲什麽愚蠢釗這樣的田地？你們的膽子爲什麼懦弱到這樣的程度？你們的眼睛爲什麽短視到那樣的可憐？一然而沒有結果。他們也不會覺悟，後來，我覺得有這樣的朋友也沒用的，我們不需要這樣的朋友。於是我的心也釋然下來了。從此我决心過着我認爲應該過的生活，對於陣靈的友誼，我始終保持着那種熱烈的態度。而我們的往來更因此而密切。我常常安慰他，在可能的範圍之內帮助他，使他不致受窮窘的生活而懊惱。並且有時我還向他解釋；勻們所遭遇的「所在」。他很坦然而快樂，而對於我的眞摯的友情，他感激得流淚。這使我非常的驚詫。因爲，我曉得阿金只會流血而不會流淚的人。現在怎樣會流起淚呢？有一次，當我們對面坐着談論到各種事情，特別當我講到人間的那種悲慘的故事上面，果眞，他忍耐不住了。那寳貴的老人之淚，那彷彿血般的老人之淚，悄悄地就落在這陰鬱的黑暗的汚穢的地面上了。那時，我感到說不出的一種痛快。因爲我們的生命更囚此以旺盛。我覺得：這牢不可破的精神與情感的團結，對於他們含着一種惡意去嘲笑和凌辱我們這回事，除了激勸我們的反抗的熱情之外，我們行麼都不感到了。</p>

<h3 id="c175">做父親的感想 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 迅鳩</p>
<p>回到家中，因爲看到自己的幾個孩子，終天纏住在身邊哭鬧掙噪的情形，不田得使我想起了十幾年前自己在做孩子時候的景况，這雖不能作我目前教育孩子的楷模，不過一想到當時父親用着嚴厲的態度，在純粹封建思想所統制下的那種道德的威權，使我至今還牢牢地刻在心上起着一種肅然畏敬的感想。</p>
<p>我從六歲進了初級小學，一直到十一歲畢業，可說完全是在父親嚴厲的管束下，過着冷板凳式的生活，那時候跟我關係發生得最深，而帮着父親完成敎養責仟的唯一恩物，就是終日擺在他書桌傍邊的一根戒尺！</p>
<p>每天我從小學裏放學回來，當父親用着純濁喉嚨叫着我的時候，踏進書房第一限看到而使我心上發抖的，就是那根沉重而粗笨的戒尺！這時我一點都不敢撒野，戰戰競競地走到我坐的那只桌位上，於是那些三字經百家姓論語孟子，我學校以外的許多書籍，就一本一本攤開來敎我慢慢地　着，讀熟了便將背起來，如果背的時候，遇到艱難生疏的地方，那根戒尺便會立刻打到身上，我一面忍沣痛，一面用袖管拭着眼淚，但是嘴裏　得喃喃地讀着，直到完全能够讀熟爲止，我是無論如何沒有倖免爺望的　　除了讀書之外，對於嬉遊飲食，我也時常在一個馴服畏懼的心理下，獨自度着寂寞的生活，即使在偶然的機會中，跑到了找一個另外的世界中，可是，碰到那些終犬在田野裏頑皮得像小雀兒般的同伴，不妙被他們作馬兒騎，便是搶去我的帽兒當球兒踢，這是我開始紅着臉，感到被人殘踏時的悲哀。</p>
<p>不過一到家，想起自己尙未完畢的功課，我父親可怕的臉色，和那根沉重而粗笨的戒尺，不覺又湧現到我的眼前了。</p>
<p>十幾年前的一幕童年生活，還是那麽淸楚的切在我記憶中，但是看到現在自己的孩子，那種活潑嬉遊，終犬不把讀書當一會事的情形，我不覺爲自己的童年也有點感想了。</p>
<h3 id="c176">「幽默文學再生」的討論 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 兆翔</p>
<p>一切底帶有軟性的文章我都不大喜歡看的，我酷愛的是那些描寫現實的文章。正確底人生底有力的啓示，必然要在這樣底作品之中才可獲得，然而在苦悶底環境裏客觀底條件的限制之下，牠是不免受其相對底决定的，而幽默文學的出現，也自有其社會的因素了。</p>
<p>對於幽默文學，我從來都不主張加以特別提倡的，雖說幽默文學有其側面的揭示現實底醜惡的一種作用。因爲幽默每每是給人家假借得不成樣子的。胡風先生有一段對於幽默底見解：</p>
<p>「第一是，如果離開了「社會的關心」，無論是傻笑冷笑以及什麽會心的微笑，都會轉移人們底注意中心，變成某種心理或生理的愉快，「爲笑笑而笑笑」要被禮拜六派認爲後生可畏的弟弟。第二是，就是眞正的幽默罷，但那地盤也是非常小的。子彈呼呼的地方的人們無暇幽默，赤地千里流離失所的人們無暇幽默，行在街頭巷尾的失業的人們也無暇幽默。……</p>
<p>胡先生這見解，我想一般人是有同感的。幽默是種無可奈何的歛態。作爲一種不得不如此寫法是可以的。」個作者，他把握着了一件題材，他表現的手法當然有多種的，這里不得不幽默一點寫出來的時候，他絕不會不狡慧點而硬撞現實，於是深入的刺諷烘托的手法形式的變換遂爲一時之尙。</p>
<p>幽默和刺諷並不有什麼衝突的，反之幽默裏是楚含有刺諷，刺諷裏含有點幽默也並不致礙事的。</p>
<p>我並不反對幽默是有其存在的作用，然而要打起了「幽默文學」底旗幟來加以提倡的話，我以爲是倒可以不必的。這就是，正如胡風先生所說；就算是眞正的幽默罷，那地盤也是非常之小的。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>有點討厭的事情—我是不否認的—即自從學舞以來，法國裁縫就特別奉承我。無論在大街上或在散步時候，他一看見我，便要停住脚步大聲地同我談了好久的話。在第一次談話時他競吿訴我說，他的祖父在路易十六宮廷裏面會經當過掌爐官。</p>
<p>「是的，菲力先生，」他歎了一口氣說，同時把他那瓷製鼻烟壺獻給我，「你看一個世界怎樣衰落下來啊——但我的娜麗，—你是懂得我的，菲力先生！一他從衣袋裏淘出一張彩色有格子的手帕來，揩乾他那對小眼睛。一無可奈何啊！我是一個窮人，但是那孩子，—他是我的寶貝，我的心肝啊！」說時他眨眼並用一種父輩的眼光看了我一下，彷彿他也要把我拉進這衰洛的世界裏面去的。</p>
<p>不久，最後一次跳舞功踝就到來了，我們把這次功課變成了一個小跳舞會。親長們都被邀請來參觀我們的跳舞；在我的親長方面祇有我的母親答應來參觀，我的父親因爲當行業醫生及本城公醫關係向來是謝絕一切應酬的。天氣一黑，我沒有耐煩再等，未到規定時間便走進大堂裏去；這裏面今晚壁燈和掛燈上所有蠟　都點着了。我關了門轉身一看，祇見娜麗一個＝人背對着我在窗戶前面站着。關門聲部使她吃了一驚，她似乎在趕忙把一件金色飾物從乎上脫下來。當我走近她面前時，我看見這是隻乎　，扣子已經扣上了，她無論怎樣努力都解不開來。</p>
<p>「講牠帶在那裏好了，娜麗！」我說。</p>
<p>「這不是我的，」她帶點狼狽回答，「燕妮放在這裏忘記拿回去的。」</p>
<p>這隻用光澤微弱的威尼斯金製成上　精緻玫瑰花朶的乎鐲在那隻褐色的織瘦乎腕上微徵閃出光來。</p>
<p>「旣然帶上了，就由牠帶着好了！」我輕輕地說。</p>
<p>娜麗愁悶地搖搖頭，她的指頭又在扣子上面摸素了。</p>
<p>「來吧！」我說，一這樣是不行的；我來帮你的忙！」我感覺她的小乎有點斤兩地放在我的乎裏。，我遲疑了一會，我的眼睛暈眩了。</p>
<p>「請你快一點吧！」她要求我。小姑娘把眼睛垂向地下，滿臉通紅地就站在我的面前。</p>
<p>扣子終於解開了。娜麗一聲不響便把金乎鐲安放在窗板上面花盆中間。</p>
<p>不久之後大堂內都是人了。波力嘉太太也不放棄這個機曾，至少她是以下人資格來參加她的女兒底這個祝會的。她帶着新漿洗過的帽子，有時提着一籃糕餅，有時托着，個茶盤，在客人中間走來走去。最後，音樂家開始奏樂了；今天共有四個音樂家坐在一個桌子旁邊。老跳舞師敲着提零響盤，娜麗便拿乎給我跳起　瑪茲卡舞」來。—你看，我們怎麽跳啊！她又何等安貼地在我的懷抱裏，淺不在乎地拿她小脚踏着地板啊！我也隨着她跳去，彷佛音樂底節拍推動着我一樣。我彷彿有一種痛苦的感覺，因爲我們今天是浪後一次了，也許以後永無同舞機會了。</p>

<p>— 胡兆文</p>
<p>我是一個學生，而且還是一個大學生，當然，我與「學生國貨年」多少總是有點關係的。但是，我偏要說我與「學生國貨年」沒有關係，什麼道理呢？因爲我在未定「學生國貨年」之先，和旣定「學生國貨年」之後，無論是購買物件，無論是添置服裝，我的一貫的購買和服用國貨的主張和計劃，始終沒有改變過，今年以前主張盡量地用國貨，今年依舊是盡量地用國貨，以前未曾喊過高調和口號，到今天爲止，我也沒有參加過所謂國貨運動。</p>
<p>我向來不迷信外國貨的，私自地大買特買，或大用特用外國貨，那更談不到，單就國貨這方面來講，我自認爲是站在時代前面的，因爲自小我就實行了所謂「學生國貨年」的工作，三年前我進大學一年級的時候，竹對同學說過這樣一句話：「不到放洋的前三天，我是决不做西裝的。」雖然國貨呢也可以做西裝，但此刻畢竟還是鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>「學生國貨年」的工作，前不多時的確緊張了一些時候，推行聯合會也開過了，懇切的演講詞，長篇數千言的巨著，在報章相雜誌上，很容易看得到。但是我不敢相信寫文章和演說的先生們，個個都是服用國貨的實行家。就是在前次乘汽車到市政府去宣誓的上海學生中，恐怕至少也可以找得出幾位穿洋貨西裝的來。</p>
<p>一種運動，單靠高聲疾呼，講道論理是可以成功的嗎？不！促其成功的還是實幹」的精神。在「學生國貨年」中，我希望全國的同學們，從個人出發，大家都來用國貨，穿國貨。更希望全國的同學們，不僅僅在今年的「學生國貨年」中，用國貨，穿國貨：而且要把今年的「學生國貨年」，視爲自今年起開始服用國貨的意思，以後還要永遠地服用下去</p>
<h3 id="c225">從發明國貨說到人才的需要 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>最近，國貨界有件可喜的發明，就是，天虛我生先生自造筆尖，已吿成功讀了無敵筆將要問世的新聞，我們對於一個努力國貨的陳先生，不能沒有一種欽偑的意思。我以爲：我們的國貨界中，正希望着有許多像天虛我生先生般的人才，來發明「天不虛我生」的工作</p>
<p>本來，中國人好像是最喜歡模倣的民族，看見了，種事業可以做，便你也模倣，我也學樣，於是粗製濫造，偸工减科，可做的事業，變成不可做的了。從前杭州張小泉剪月店是很有名的，不多時，便你也　張小泉，我也呌張小泉，好像凡是剪刀店，非呌張小泉開不成的。現在還是樣，新設立一家電木廠，過了不久，電木廠便開了好幾十家。當然，大家以爲這個事業可以做得，大家都不好做這件事了。我們的國貨界，時常徬徨有「模倣」的歧途中，而找不到創造的途徑，這是很可以躭憂的！</p>
<p>我再來說發明國貨的重要。有許多愛用國貨的人，大都很痛心國貨用品的不全備，所以不得不用外國做代替品。假使有了入才，慢慢地把貨品所沒有的用具，創造出來，貢獻給社會。我想，至少比大家鑽在一個工業裏，你傾我軋，多少總有些利益吧！而且一方面，可以杜絕洋貨的進口，使得國貨的敵人，得以肅淸！</p>
<p>不過，事實上，也許有很多困難。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>暑假將至，各級學校學生，都是停北課業，回里消夏，這二個月的光陰，我想自愛的學生，决不使他虛度的。今年旣是學生國貨年，最好的辦法，莫如努力於提倡國貨的工作。怎樣工作呢？、</p>
<p>（一）本鄉盡力官傳服用國貨的利益，勸導家人戚友一律服用國貨。</p>
<p>（二）在本鄉調查國貨與外貨銷路的比較，最好用數目字統計出來，宣示大衆，以着警惕。</p>
<p>（三）徵集各種國貨樣品，舉行流動國貨展覽會。</p>
<p>（四）分往各商店，勸導店主一律販賣國貨。</p>
<p>（五）晚上或利用鄉人餘暇，舉行露天演講，勸導鄉人絕對不用外貨。</p>
<p>（六）織服用國貨會立定公約，徵求地方人士一律加入以資倡導。</p>
<p>我可敬可愛的學生，這種工作，是最値得做的，最有價値的救國工作，大家努力去幹罷。</p>
<p>第一，恐怕廠家沒有許多資本以供發明的試騐。第二，恐怕發明了以後，沒有銷路。第一點，我希望政府當局相有志的國貨廠家合作起來，大規模地徵求有創造力的人才。第二點，請賢明的顧客，摒除購買洋貨的劣根性，共同扶助國貨的新創事業。如果我的話能拋磚引玉，這才是我的希望！</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>日前報載關於我們家鄉—無錫—的一段紀聞，讀了眞是萬分痛心！怎麽樣呢？原來振務會購辦的大批振米，完全是外國米（西貢），簽發支票的有中國銀行五千元，農民銀行五千元，免稅振米，已由滬購就二號西貢米計六千石，每石合價約銀七元有零（按每石以七元計，就有四萬二千元白銀，流到外國去了！）第三，五·六·七·等鄉區振戶，大小口有三萬餘名，這許多農人，因遭旱荒！而得到振濟—究竟能否持久？吃了安乎不安？我以爲總不是根本辦法！老友楚聲兄，在四號錢業月報述評裏「資金將因坐吃而吃盡」文中，略謂「資金之流出，仍源源不絕不但不絕而已，竟在大量輸出中，如洋米一項，本年兩個月之輸入，合國幣一〇、五一七、七八三元，其他物品，尙不在內，此一千餘萬元資金，完全用以易米，而米爲食糧，旣食之後，悉化烏有！……假令食之而有所生產，尙不爲虛費，無如農村之遭旱荒者，人民逃荒他鄉，但求一飽，而毫無所事……我國資金有限，何堪經此白吃！諺所謂「坐吃山空」又謂吃盡當光！昔以諷一家一人者，今則可移以諷全社會」云，異常驚惕！</p>
<p>我的意見，應該拿成萬的振濟欵子（白銀）貸給災民，或散發種子，竭力提倡養兎，……等副業（如友人申新三廠總管薛明劍君所倡辦的）不應養成他們安坐而食振米的心理，卽使採辦，也可以中國麵粉代之何必定需洋米，眼應着大量白銀，奉送給外人呢？</p>
<p>唉！在這轟烈烈的學生國貨年」裏，一方而吃的，還要大量的仰求於外人，怎麽講得過去呢！</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>諸位親愛的學生諸君：今年不是各團體公定的學生國貨年」嗎？在「學生國貨年中，雖然提倡國貨的呼聲，仍然是十分激昻，可是外貨的進口，仍舊是十分猛晋，十分可怕呢？這，只要我們稍爲留心一下報紙上的統計，是能菲常明白的。這種情形，是如何的使我們發生無窮的憤慨與痛心呀</p>
<p>但是，朋友，你千萬莫悲傷，我來吿訴你幾件好消息吧這的確是學生國貨年中的好現象，好消息，値得我們歡欣與祝賀的，那便是實業家天虛我生先生發明了國貨鋼筆尖，國貨經濟筆，以及林履彬先生發明的國貨橡皮，都先後成功的了，這不是幾個値得注意的好消息嗎？現在我把三件新發明品，簡單的介紹在下面，希望大家注意一下，</p>
<p>（一）國貨鋼筆尖</p>
<p>這種國貨鋼筆尖，是人虛我生先生發明的，他老人家看到外貨鋼筆尖在中國學生界銷路之宏大，於是便决心研究國貨鋼筆尖的發明，以資抵抗，經過了不少時候的研究改良，現在居然成功了，這種筆，係G字式的，將來還要造波羅式的，寫在中國紙上，亦可不滲，現在積極製造中，一俟造成十萬枚，卽可登報發行云云。</p>
<p>（二）無敵經濟筆</p>
<p>這種無敵經濟筆，也是他老人家與林履彬先生共同研究發明的，筆的形式，與市上銷售的自來水筆，並無二樣，而筆尖，筆桿，橡皮管，完全用國貨原料，其售價亦不過在一二角大洋左右，較之自來水筆，眞不知相差了若干倍，現在也在積極製造中，一俟造成，卽可由家庭工業社發售，而一般學生諸君，也可以人各一枝，不必費了極大的代價，去購買外貨自來水筆了，這也不是一個値得欣慰的好消息嗎？</p>
<p>（三）國貨橡皮</p>
<p>橡皮這東西，一向是只有外國貨的，林履彬生爲挽回利權起見，决心創造一種國貨橡皮，以瞧各界需要，經過許多時候的研究，現在已經有了很好的出品了，上海市敎育局曾通令各校採購，市商會國貨商傷也切實審查，認爲確係完全國貨云云。</p>
<p>上面這三件事，不是學生國貨年中的好消息嗎？我很希望諸位親愛的學生諸君，從今而後，有國貨可用的，絕對的不再去購用外貨，這樣才對得起幾位發明人的苦心，同時也是學生們應盡的義務，應有的天職呢？</p>
<h3 id="c229">國貨界之新發明 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 麗孫</p>
<p>——華氏全綫中華呢——</p>
<p>提起南京的玄緞來，大槪人們總知道它是曾經作過貢品的，而且它還享受過很大的名譽，所以玄緞兩個字，在人們腦筋廛有過很深的印象，在它全盛的時代，恃他爲生的工人，竟有二十多萬；每年的銷數，不下千萬元，它的盛况，也就可以想見了，但是不幸的很自從舶來品的直貢呢；華達呢等輸入中國以後，玄緞遂受到很大的打擊，降至現在，竟致一蹶不振，失業的工人，在十萬人以上，這是多麽不幸啊！</p>
<p>南京風遊寺十一號雲昌織造廠的華雨田父子，也是緞業中一個特出的人材，自從南京玄緞，被直貢呢打倒以後，他就從事研究織呢，經過了三年的長久時間。失敗了好幾十次，結果終成功了，現在，他已將這種呢定名全綫中華呢，它的優點有好幾種：第一是質料滑不受灰塵第二是經久且不上霉斑，第三是質有韌性，不會折斷，且因韌性强，故可以耐久。第四是價格廉，該呢的價格，比較舶來品的直貢呢，要便宜到一半，最合於作袍褂相鞋料之用。現在已經織成的計分兩種：一是二尺五寸寬，二丈五尺長面積的，專爲馬褂及袍料之用。另一種是五寸寬面積的，專作鞋料之用，每一捲可做鞋料五雙。華雨田父子巳經特約本京著名的三山街聯陞成，三山街三級，府束街三聚，花牌樓三履，承恩寺華勝敦等十數家鞋店採用中華呢作鞋料。一而並呈請實業部準予專利。華雨田父子並擬繼續研究，織造各種顏色的全綫中華呢。關於研究的情形，和發明的經過，據華雨田父子聲種：係由民二十二年五月間開始，先將直真。拆開，探討其原料與織法後，就開始製造，但是織成的不但紋理改粗，更不耐用，中間共經過數十次的失敗，十幾次的變化，卒底於成。其中的變化，大略可分爲三大部份，第一步爲絲經與綫同織，結果紋細相緞子一樣，不堅牢，第二步是以絲爲經，而以綫爲緯，但結果則枚理過粗，第三步全絲織，始成此全綫中華呢，計自開始研究以水，共織成呢七八十疋，而不合用者約佔半數，金錢損失，在千元以上，至於精神上之損失，直無法統計了。</p>
<p>據說：直貢呢的輸入額年達數白萬元，今華雨田父子所發明的全綫中華呢，品質旣優，售價又廉，當然可以打倒舶來的直貢呢這眞可以說是學生國貨年的一個好消息，而値得我們鄭重介紹的啊！</p>

<p>現在女學生們所穿的旗袍愛愛藍布，（一名摩登藍布）像這種藍布，大槪女學生都誤認爲國貨，不知其來歷，因爲金錢外溢者，爲數可觀，覺得非常痛心。現在略述一二，以吿同胞。按愛愛藍布，市上所出售者，一部份是某洋行出品的陰丹士林布，大部份是某華商廠出品，或某印染廠出品，如此冒名國貨的藍布牌子很多。一般喪心病狂的商人，從中取利，將此種藍布改頭換面，或先進白疋，加以印染，於市上出售，冲作完全國貨。攷其原坯，盡皆劣品，若欲購眞正之國產，絕無僅有，一般購用者，都墮入彀中。今年是學生國貨年，我見一般女學生都穿起了這種藍色的校服，勸人勿買洋貨，恐怕給外人要笑歪嘴吧了。在這裏我連想到去年南市十布商店曾經開過一次七布展覽會，收集農村自紡自織的士布多種，出品亦覺不差，南市某某女學等曾採用爲校服，頗覺文雅可觀，並具甘地精神，一般家居女性，效尤者亦很多。今年竟一變而一致採用外貨，大槪不知其底蘊而上了奸商的大當吧！（却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c231">國貨精煉漿粉之介紹 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>吾友無錫申新三廠總管薛明劍君，對於研究國貨工藝，極具熱心，最近渠於養兎代蠶之提倡，亦不遺餘力！又瓶辦允利化學工業公司出有紅心牌精煉漿粉一種，記者鑑於國貨之亟應普及，爰樂爲介紹如左：</p>
<p>公司緒言本公司所出紅心牌精煉漿粉，係由化學專家會同紡織工程師，悉心研究而成，用以漿紗，可使顏色光澤，拉力增加，用以漿布，可無浚泛布面之弊，且可無須加用牛油，不特工人手續可以减省，兼可减輕費用，實爲國貨工廠之福音云云。</p>
<p>優點一般（一）漿缸如不用精煉漿粉，須用牛油五十磅，（或多至八十磅）牛油每斤一角八分計算，則每缸可减省原料四五元。（二）用舶來品漿粉精和入漿缸，須待水汀七八十度熱度，方可和入，早放恐難調勻，遲放漿力薄弱，如用本粉，隨漿和入，放冷水調勻，卽開水汀，水汀熱透，便可應用，無早放遲放之慮。（三）本粉完全溶解於水，可使紗幹拉力增强而滑活，於染色工程上不僅容易，且可省料節時！</p>

<p>— （淸癯）</p>
<p>黃梅時節，天天落雨，而且還潮濕，使得人像處生深甕裏差不多，豈不是要悶死麽？以前人說：「黃梅時節家家雨，靑草池塘處處蛙」，這兩句詩，眞覺有些意思包含在裏面，因爲這種天氣，在吾們南邊地方，和農作確是很有關係。</p>
<p>今歲交了夏季，好久不下雨，鄕農把棉花種泥士像香灰一般。你去想，怎樣能發出嫩葉來；就是馬上有大雨降下，已經補種不及了。在城市和都會，不耕而食的人們，是不曉得荒年的現，又已來臨。</p>
<p>俗語說：「夏至不來，水柩不開，實在棉花種不成。不要想種禾稻，像吾們嘉定，並且還是棉七稻三」，就是種棉花的多，種禾稻的少，小熟一荒，大熟怎麼會得有希望呢？唉！人禍不能消弭，一綫生機，原仗天公來照，倘蒼蒼者也不肯佑我小百姓，那末：試問救星還在何處啊！</p>
<h3 id="c233">飢餓 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 倪尙龍</p>
<p>飢餓，火一般的飢餓總該是人人都害怕的一樁事吧！</p>
<p>宋朝的儒人說過一句「餓死事小，失節事大」的話，這話看起來倒也很冠冕堂皇，可是歷來葬送在這句話的虎口裏面的可也不少。在小的時候，聽我的父親說；我的姑媽就是這話奉行者：當我的姑夫死後，伊爲了不願失節，眞的實行絕食，只五天工夫，就全節面追隨伊的丈夫於九泉之下了！</p>
<p>據傳說：從前伯夷叔齊兩兄弟，就因爲恥食周粟而逃到首陽山去食薇蕨，後來因認爲薇蕨也是周家的，爽性不食了，乾脆餓死在首陽山上，我想，這兩位難兄難弟未免太愚蠢，五穀和薇蕨都是天生的，有什麽周家不周家之分呢！呵！可咒詛的「餓死事小，失節事大」呀</p>
<p>印度的不抗抵主義的甘地，是以絕食爲拿手好戲的，這從他多次絕食並未餓死中看來出，所以餓也是一種藝術，有高明和不高明的分別。我又想到了甘地的絕食，只是他的文明抵抗的一種，他希望用絕食來感動他的主子或貴族的老爺們，在我看來，這比之夷齊兩兄弟稍高明一點吧！</p>
<p>飢餓在中國，很有歷史，「餓莩載道一，「大飢」一類可怕的字，老是在歷代的史書中不可少的點綴。這種可咒詛的飢餓，現在更像瘋狂的野火般在各處延燒着，它吞沒了無數有用的男女老幼</p>

<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>枇杷黃了的時節，爲了有人偸，又怕給松鼠跟鳥類的啄食，一家家都忙着搭棚來看枇杷了。照例的我家即架空搭在堂屋邊廂裏的松木架，也給卸下來移搭到枇杷園裏來了。</p>
<p>蘆蓆蓋着頂，四週圍上了蘆簾，裏邊擱着板，又吊着那項七補八綻的破帳兒，眞像是所小小的房屋呵，住在裏邊的人可沒給風來吹，沒給兩來打的安靜呵</p>
<p>白天，黑夜，在枇杷園裏是够熱鬧的；每家園裏響相着火油箱跟竹梆子的拷擊聲，生活在自然界的鳥類不知嚇得躱藏到那裏去了。</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>胡善孫雖不是百萬富翁，但擁着祖遺的二家四五十年的老店，每年約五六千的收入，所以生活是很舒適的。</p>
<p>雖然他的大兒子，也都已娶妻生子了，但是他却還是好色若命。雖然他的老婆是像賊一般的防他，但是只要有機會，他是便會幹出偸雞摸狗的事來的。</p>
<p>在三年之前，他的家鄉鬧着水災，窮苦人家，都忍着痛的賣兒鬻女，於是胡善孫的老婆，便花了一百八十塊錢，託人不鄕去售了二個婢女。那二個婢女，是一對姊妹，大的那年是十五歲，小的還小着二歲。</p>
<p>就在那一年，胡善孫把大的那一個瞧中了，於是威嚇利誘的，便弄上了手，而且還累得那婢女受了孕。過了不久，這秘密便給胡善孫的老婆窺破了，把那婢女結結實實的打得死去活來，不用說了，同時，還去招了一個穩婆來給墮胎。結果是胎兒　母體，同歸於盡。</p>
<p>出了這岔子之後，胡善孫的老婆，爲曲突徙薪計，把那個小的婢女，撥給大媳婦差使。俗語說，有其父，必有其子，眞對，到了去年冬裏，這個小的，也因胡善孫的大兒子的威迫而受孕了。在秘密給揭穿之後，也由穩婆墮胎，而結果了性命。</p>
<p>事後，胡善孫的老婆，還是不住的肉痛着，說的是連身價和棺殮費，一共花了有近四百塊錢呢。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>現在戰爭的方式，因科學進步，空軍的發達，已從平面進步到立體，戰爭的範圍，從前方擴大到後方，故對於空中的防備，是現在國防上第一要務。我國的防空事業，尙係初創，非軍民協力一致的組織起來，不易成功。國民政府軍事委員會防空委員會，有鑒於此，爲喚起民衆注意防空，幷設法普遍灌輸防空知識起見，故於本月六日起，在首都舉行防空展覽會。籌成適於是日因新藥業請願而赴京，次日曾往參觀，爰將所見袖錄如下：</p>
<p>開慕時之會塲，借公共體育場，能容二萬餘人，入夜即在該塲映演關於防空問題之露天影戲。陳列室設在第公園，與該塲打通，門口高轟雲霄之牌坊上，即縣有銀色飛機模型，旁有聯曰：「無防空設備的國家，不能存於今日的世界。」「有自衛組織之民衆，方足應付現代之戰爭。」總理遺囑碑後，特豎炸彈模型，計四公尺長，兩噸重，令人望而寒心。旁有丈餘見方之廣吿牌，上繪飛機投彈，致都市炸燬慘狀，觸目驚心，頓憶一二八閘北被災景象，幾欲下淚。在逍遙游弟一陳列室內，見有各種「照測器材照片」，及「戰爭方式演進圖」」。以三丈長之長桌，上置數十隻飛機模型，各機面前，將名稱，式樣，性能，體積，重量等，詳細列表，分別註明，使人一目了然。阻寨汽球網，式樣不一，是室所布置者，係網形懸弔式之一種。蘆蓆棚內，有「砲兵僞半裝網」，及「保險傘」，一則網上遍鋪黃泥綠草，俾敵機在空中偵察時，不知該處藏有砲兵。一則中徑二丈四尺，分二十四摺，以二十四條絲繩聯結於皮帶，在空中跳下時使用，以國貨綢布製，更難能可貴。另有板，劃分八格，係統計世界各國軍用飛機之多寡，上釘五寸長之飛機模型，以一架代表一百，法最多釘五十隻，波最少釘十隻，其他美俄英意日德依次排列，遠視之，宛似數百蜻蜓停於是處。表演高射砲之效力，製有二尺高之木台，四週排列高射砲，式各不同，口皆向上，以一飛機通以電流，使在空中飛舞，四砲之口，隨是機往來而轉移，式甚精巧。各種炸彈剖解後，附以說明，大小不一，第，陳列室在地政學會，佈置理想的都市防空配備模型，爲監視情報警報室，何處爲阻塞地帶，何處爲射擊地帶，何處爲聽測地帶，何處爲監視地帶，僉以距中心之遠近數目而規定。　下室內，房屋曲折，布置齊全，爲戰時避彈之處。第三陳列室在烈士祠內，有頭戴防毒器之摩登女模型，嘴長三寸，與西游記內之猪八戒相仿，觀衆莫不注意。救護室旁置一未請防空法，被炸彈炸死之人體模型，右耳與左腿，均炸傷，而肉糢糊，慘不忍覩，維妙維肖。該園地址廣大，劃有路綫，故觀者雖人山人海，仍秩然有序。</p>

<h3 id="c239">白人與黑人通婚 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>世界的糾紛，一大部分的原因，是起於人種的差別。要是這個世界所有的人類，都是同一人種，彼此一定比較客氣，不至於會像現在這樣，動不動就發生衝突。那知創造宇宙萬物的上帝，偏要那麽不公平，把這些分布在全球五大洲的人類，分成黃白黑紅稷五色人種，呌你每一種人在皮脂色素上染一樣不同的顏色。這一來，事情就麻煩了。有一種人。他自以爲是由上帝特別製造出來的，他是上帝的選民，是人類中的最優秀份子。他不但這樣自認，還要强派和他異種的人爲劣等人種，說你是上帝用最壤的材料揑成的。自然，世界上優秀人種和劣等人種都分配定當了。</p>
<p>昨日偶然從報上看到一則很有趣味的消息，說是蕭伯納自南菲歸國，以爲白人生殖率低下，此後於南菲難佔優勢，故主張白人與黑人實行通婚。蕭氏這種主張，顯然是爲維持白人在南菲的優勢，並不是就要打破種族差別的觀念。不料這一句話却引起全德人士的驚異了。德國人是白色人種，就是我前面所說。自認爲上帝選民的優秀人種。而黑種人呢？他是劣等人種呵。簫氏要呌優秀人種的白人去和劣等人種的黑人實行通婚，這敎德國人士那得不表示驚異呢？不過南菲駐德公使姬伊教授，他是一位有名的人種學者，對於這種主張大為不然，認蕭氏的話，為編劇家不負責任之言，蓋不獨南菲政府這種意思，即南菲白人，莫不欲維持人種的純粹，並認白人必能繁殖綿延於南菲，且白人的文化，爲歐洲文化，乃一不容讓步的文化也。</p>
<p>到底姬伊敎授是一位有名的人種學家，故有這般見解。若蕭伯納，只是一個編劇家，只能胡扯一些不負責任的話了。</p>

<p>— 齊水</p>
<p>工作的磨難，使我們變成愚蠶：</p>
<p>我們感受智識的饑餓甚於麵包！</p>
<p>這是「上海義務流通圖書館」於最近成立時所發綠起中所說的。</p>
<p>上海義務流通圖書館，這一名字，對於讀者，一定是非常生疎的。不錯，這是幾個靑年於最近，誠如他們在緣起中所說，深深的感受到自己在工作中知識的饑餓，幷更感覺到社會上許多失學的靑年，一切在工作中的人們，深深地感受到知識的饑餓，因此，他們乃抱着這使自己知識可以得到若干的滿足，幷使一般同一在知識饑餓與追求中的人們都得到若干的滿足，抱着這樣的志願—這志願雖說是極微小的，但也極宏大的—而成立了這個義務的流通圖書館的。</p>
<p>由於朋友的介紹，最近使我有這一</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>機會，到他們幾位熱心靑年所辦的流通圖書館中去參觀一次。</p>
<p>我深深地爲他們幾個靑年服務社會的熱心與毅力所感動。因之，我得在這里把參觀後所得一些感念，寫出來爲這圖書館和一般讀者介紹一番。我深信這决不是多餘的工作，在這社會上，對於這圖書館的贊助？我想當然是我們的責任。</p>
<p>這圖書館的設立地點，是在本埠岳州路（十八路無軌電車終點）養慈坊十三號。創辦者是姚君等幾位熱心於社會服務的靑年。他們本人都有自己的職業，可是他們更能把一半的業餘時間辦理這圖書館。這圖書館從創立到現在，還只將近一個月，可是讀者數巳有二百六七十人之多，每天到館閱讀的也有數十人。這圖書館是完全義務的，讀者借書完全不必付出任何的代價。現有書籍約三千冊，雖不完備，但各門類大槪都有一些。據姚君說，讀者以附近的高小學生爲最多，約占百分之四十，其次小商店職員，再次爲附近一帶工廠之工人與家庭婦女等。姚君又說，附近高小學生所以到該館借書的特別多，是因爲這些學校只知收學費而全不講究對於學校的圖書館設備，其次是現代的敎育對於一般靑年有沒有益處，也很成爲問題，因之，他們這班在知識慾强烈追求中的靑年，對於這雖然十分簡陋的小圖書館，也不能不熱烈的去親近它了。這意見實是極確當的。從此，我們也可看出類乎這圖書館的社會上一般的圖書館，對於社會一般尋求知識的羣衆，是如何急切地需要了。</p>
<p>其次是關於書籍問題。因爲他們力量有限，所以書籍太都由捐募而來。但據他們經騐，對社會一般有地位的人捐書十分困難，反之，一般不相識的讀者却正是他們最熱心的書籍捐助者。這里也可看出這圖書館一方爲社會服務，一方又建基於社會要求知識的羣衆身上的。</p>
<p>這圖書館所佔的地位，雖只是小小的一間屋，可是，他們的熱心與對於將來的期望，是極遠大的。希望社會一般讀者，能對它加以莫大的贊助。我們須記着；</p>
<p>帮助這圖書館的發展，同時卽是帮助我們自己知識的發展！</p>

<p>— 克明</p>
<p>旺太陽一天接十天地晒在開了裂的黃黃的土地上，天氣一天天的熱起來，嫩嫩的稻桿子給晒得滾熱，像煎乾了似的。做田人底心，於是也像在沸油裏煎熬一樣地焦急起來了。過了端陽（這端陽，可再也不能跟往年相比的了，人們底心思全化在找尋充飢的東西上面，再沒有誰記到這節日了。）天還是那麽乾燥，而稻子對水的需要却一天一天地迫急起來。村子裏面的空氣，也變得緊張了。在田頭，在小河邊，在絞架似的水戽車上，在鎭上的，小茶館裏，憂急的臉與嘆息的聲音已經隨處可以找得出：「去年荒了一年，鄉下人已經去掉了大半條命了，弄得到秋末還得掘山芋來吃。要是今年再一乾，要是今年再一荒，要是這幾天再沒有雨呢……測想，當在凶險的景像面前，是儒弱的，一想到了一年來挨餓的經騐，心裏像投進了一把石子，重重地壓着，便再也沒有想下去的勇氣了。</p>
<p>可以說，天氣倒是怪好的，那末旺的太陽整個月地不斷的晒着，烤一般地晒着，到五月下旬，已經執得人發了昏，連一件襒了胸的短布衫都穿不住了。人全有着一種恐懼與怨恨，「連天都跟人作起對頭來了！」那麽想，在田頭做活也沒了氣力，心也冷起一半了。人黃昏頭從田裏回來，走過水戽車，狠狠地項了它一眼，彷彿說：「又快要用得着你，又快要借着你去跟老天拚命了。」去年乾，村上還有十來家人家用洋龍把田救了一部份回來，而今年，人家都巴經「十家九空」了，連春上下種還是勉强冒了險的，還有那家用得起洋龍來呢？還有……</p>
<p>沒有事，被呌作「外帮客人的我們，化四個銅子上茶館（鎭上的「老虎灶」），便有人來把田裏頭的書境吿訴你了。其實，這倒是不錯的；年來無論種田，做小買賣，全有着許多說不盡的苦處；本來是個艱苦的年頭，樣樣事情不順手，也是不難想得到的意料中的情况啊！</p>
<p>（一個老年人，額上堆着亂草一般的縐紋，臉是枯瘦而黝黑的，彷彿唸着可怕的咒語似地嘮　地動着嘴唇，吐出不淸楚的音節：</p>
<p>「田地嗎？可眞沒有用啊！守着也是等死啦。年紀老了，要是我年紀還輕。也像你們那樣的小夥子一樣的，我老早就跟你們天南地北地浪出去了。橫豎這年頭什麽都難做。浪出去，也許可以浪出一個局面來，頂少也可以多見識點世面呀！人連飯都難弄到手，還講什麽安逸，出去像水鴨一般地飄着，不也好嗎？」）</p>
<p>求生的，流浪的，中世紀的海盜的氣分也落到這小小的村落裏來了。饑餓把這些自足的，怯懦的，狹窄的，樸實的人們從古舊的村子裏推了出來，而給了他們一種外面的世界的新奇的功課，像萬花筒一樣神妙的功課。</p>
<p>（旺太陽依舊火烈照着，大家的心是焦急的：可是，另外有一些年靑的，好奇的，力壯的小夥子却愈到了一種流浪的興味：「也許外面的世界是一個更好看的吧？」）</p>
<p>這樣，今年村裏在田裏做的，已經少了許多年輕人了——他們正勇敎地投向外面的世界去找尋生活二：而充塞在材子裏的，却是一種暮年的嘆息的氣份了</p>
<h3 id="c242">夜行 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>都市的夜和日里是沒有兩樣的，被稱做「不夜城」並不是誇張之語，都市生活的人通常午夜歸家亦成了習慣了。當自己疲憊的軀體付託了黃包車之後，在那短短的路途上彷彿一個特赦的罪犯似的，斜倒在車身里，架起了腿，自由自然地，聽着車夫的脚心打在柏油路發出那種激越的聲音；或者有時拉過一條正在修築的馬路，車身像鐘擺似的徵微顚簸着，如其不是刻刻擔心着停車時要裁個倒蜻蜓，我可以懶猪一般地熟睡遇去的；然而被車夫喚醒的時候亦不在少數。幾年來都是過着機械的生活，據說都市之夜是神秘的，但是我從沒有認淸牠的眞面目的牠對於我沒有好戚却沒來由地增加着。</p>
<p>端午節的上一天，一位中學時代的老同學約我到他江灣的新居去，在電話中他吿訴我費了許多時間邀約了十多位當時同敎室的老朋友，這個難能可貴的歡聚，來儘量樂一天罷，</p>
<p>因爲自己是個妻子的丈夫了，負上了家的重擔，在人家歡樂的佳節，往往被許多不樂意的事糾纏着；及至我把一切難關應付吿畢，已是這天的晚上了。</p>
<p>對於這次難得的集會，我還是鼓了最大的勇氣乘一路電車到天通庵車站。到江灣巳不是第一次了，小火車給我的影像很好，坐位旣舒適，路程又短，如果你靠着窗口，望着叢叢靑翠的樹木，一方更有意無意地竊聽那些鄉人的瑣瑣談家常，積壓在心底的憂恨，像初夏的輕風吹拂着柳絮一般地不留踪跡了。</p>
<p>坐上車，天空忽然飄着絲絲的細雨，沒有一枝捲烟時間，一陣一陣加緊着，到江灣車站，屋檐下已瀉着白綫的雨水。全車的久幾乎都沒有帶雨具，於是搶着出車站招一呼黃包車。但是我被一羣車夫圍着的時候，我幾乎笑了起來，我朋友的地址呌什麼名字呢。是的，到江灣來已不止一次，因爲是走熟了的路，從沒有詢問過地名，路名。在迫不得已的關頭，我拉住了一個車夫，彷彿猜謎語似的吿訴他要經過幾個橋，那些橋是標六或八公噸載重的，在一所被毀於砲火的房屋左側轉灣就是了。車夫連連點着頭，他說那是呌什麽地名。我已是沒有聽他說話的能耐了，避進車廂里催他快些拉，因爲列車開出之後，站上的路燈熄滅了。</p>
<p>身上已滿積雨水，昏沉拉過了許多路，車夫把車子停在一座小僑旁側，我抬起失望的眼睛，在附近甚至一點都不像朋友家的影子。兩個人竚立在雨中，又猜起啞謎來。</p>
<p>被車夫堅决拒絕之後，我祇能自行摸索了。這時候沒有一個路人，街燈又是那樣昏暗，我不辨東西南化，像一個水鬼似的走到一座標明着八公噸的橋樑，精密地猜度了兩旁的房屋，彷彿朋友的家就在附近了；但是我作爲最凖確的標記—一所塌屋却沒有。從一家家閉上大門的店舖端詳着，在一家白木板的門前懸着「××營造廠承造的廣吿，這原來就是塌的地址了，而剛才停車的地方亦在數步之遙，獨自笑着叩朋友的門，他們驚異我不如他們預料中的爽約。這一夜的歡聚，每個人都鼓起從前大言不慚時的天眞，一去不復返的天眞呵！</p>
<p>這或許是我生命史上難能可貴的一次夜行吧？</p>

<p>有人描寫袁美雲的活潑，說他是春天枝頭上的小鳥，有人描寫她的美麗，說她像夜裏的皎潔星月，日落西山時天空中的絢爛彩霞。</p>
<p>的確：美雲的活潑，像小鳥，美雲的美麗像星月，像彩霞。</p>
<p>美雲遼很年靑呢，正是一個靑春期中的少女，一個需要着愛來安慰的少女呢，不過美雲從沒有露過愛的表示，雖然她聲明過她不需要戀愛，可是那正是她野心的暴露，她現在眞是一個極需要愛來安慰的少女呢，假如你不相信的話，那麽你可以從她在藝華撮製下萬蒼導演的有聲片「凱歌」裏唱的一首情歌可以爲證，她是這樣的唱道：「六月江南天氣晴，姐在塘中去採菱，菱角尖尖刺痛手，赤日炎炎晒煞人，天哪天！，沒有見黃梅時節不下雨，沒有見十八歲姑娘不嫁人，菱花鏡裏想靑春」。</p>
<p>當美雲這樣歌着的時候，她的弟弟菊生——劉犂飾——羞她說：「姊姊不怕難爲情嗎？」</p>
<p>『小鬼，你這樣的壞」。美雲的臉紅得像日落的晚霞。</p>
<p>袁美雲懷春了，在卜萬蒼導演的有聲片「凱歌」裏。</p>

<p>天一有聲新片「母親」裏，有出洋留學的一幕，需要男女學生數十人合唱「送別歌」，爲了這，天一遂有歌詠隊的組成；主持人一位是在上海美專研究音樂的邵素霞小姐，一位是聯華聲樂團的丁芝小姐，其它的隊員還有大夏，復旦等校的男女同學們，現在每天都在加緊練習中。</p>
<p>新人材的加入</p>
<p>新人的缺乏、是現今影圈中所感覺到最重要的事情，天一公司也正和別家公司一樣的需要新的人材，所以天一也在那培植新的人材。</p>
<p>最近，有兩位新人加入，一位是「北平小姐」白芬，一位是「天津小姐」徐莉娜，她倆部都說着一口的標準國語，自然是我們拍有聲片所需要的了，她們的前途如何，還要看她們自己的努力。</p>

<p>王斌的「海葬」，毫無疑義的是一部有力的粗綫條的劇本，據說該劇全部描寫漁民掙扎的生活，意旨極爲偉大崇高。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Government Orders Qin Decun to Act as Acting Chairman; Song is Recalled to Zhangjiakou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations on Affairs of Hebei and Chahar Still Need to be Continued; Japanese Army Expresses No Intention to Expand</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, the National Government ordered that Song Zheyuan, member and chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, be assigned to another post. Song Zheyuan should be relieved of his duties as member and chairman. The order also stated that Qin Decun, member of the Chahar Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, should temporarily act as chairman of the provincial government. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qin Decun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Chahar, received an urgent telegram from Song Zheyuan on the evening of the 18th, ordering him to return to the province quickly. Qin left Tianjin suddenly at 6:40 a.m. on the 19th, stopped briefly in Beiping, and after visiting Bao Wen-yue, director of the Military Affairs Commission office, he returned to Chahar by evening train. Sakai, chief of staff of the Japanese army in Tianjin, returned to Tianjin from Changchun by plane at noon on the 19th. After landing at the Dongjuzi Airport, he returned to the Haiguangsi barracks. Regarding the settlement of Chahar affairs, Doihara had a proposal that was passed by the Kwantung Army headquarters. Sakai brought it back on the 19th to observe our attitude before deciding whether to present it. This matter is far from resolved and still requires considerable procedure. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Beiping this morning, Qin Decun immediately went to Jurentang to meet with committee members Wan Fulin, Bao Wen-yue, and others to detail the negotiations regarding the Zhangbei issue. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Kwantung Army headquarters held a meeting with Sakai and other representatives of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin in Changchun the night before last. Regarding the Zhangbei incident, they decided to settle it peacefully on the spot and appointed Matsui, a Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, to be responsible for negotiating with Song Zheyuan and Qin Decun to discuss solutions. Matsui was originally scheduled to fly from Changchun to Tianjin yesterday morning to meet Qin, but it was temporarily suspended due to other matters. It was changed to flying to Tianjin this afternoon. It is reported that the location for the consultation between China and Japan has been selected in Zhangjiakou or Beiping, which will be decided after Matsui arrives in Tianjin. Qin Decun received a telegram yesterday summoning him back to Chahar. He arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this morning and will leave Beiping for Zhangjiakou tomorrow. He will still come to Beiping and Tianjin in two or three days. During Qin's absence, Lin Shuyan, director of the 29th Army's Tianjin office, will be responsible for liaison. Qin Decun said that regarding the Zhangbei incident, there are still matters to be discussed, so it is not completely resolved yet. He has other matters to attend to, so he must return to Zhangjiakou, hence his trip from Tianjin to Beiping. He will leave Beiping tomorrow. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A person in charge of Song Zheyuan's 29th Army said that the Kwantung Army headquarters and the North China garrison headquarters in Japan have different views on Chahar affairs, so negotiations are very difficult. Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Chahar, had previously put forward four points hoping that we would improve, but Doihara suddenly overturned them after arriving in Tianjin. There have been slight setbacks in the solution. Commander Song obeys all orders from the central government. If a local solution and peaceful understanding can be reached, it would be good. Otherwise, please let the central government preside. After Qin Decun returned to Chahar, no one in Tianjin was responsible for direct negotiations with the Japanese. After Sakai returns, there may be new developments. Iwai, head of the Japanese special affairs agency in Shanhaiguan, is conveying the opinions of the Kwantung Army headquarters and may come to Tianjin early on the 20th to meet with Doihara and Umezu. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Sakai, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Army, returned to his post from Changchun on the afternoon of the 18th. At the station, he issued a statement saying that as a result of the Changchun talks, the Kwantung Army and the Tianjin Garrison Army were fully connected and decided on a final coordinated policy. Based on this policy, they will move forward with the Hebei-Chahar issue and future policies toward China. Furthermore, Chief of Staff Sakai met with Colonel Iwai and Lieutenant Colonel Matsui in Shenyang this morning before returning to Tianjin. (19th Dentong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Colonel Sakai and Colonel Iwai, who attended the Kwantung Army staff meeting, flew to Tianjin by military plane at 7:00 a.m. today. (19th Dentong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the result of the meeting between Special Agent Chief Doihara and Song Zheyuan's representatives, the Army Central Department has not yet received a report on the resolution of the Chahar issue. However, according to their opinion, the resolution of the overall Chahar issue is not to be believed. However, there was a point where a general solution could be expected, so the above news may not be contrary to the facts. (19th Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The North China issue has come to an end, and the dark clouds over the Chahar incident have also been swept away. The overall policy toward China of the local military headquarters has also been established. Therefore, Colonel Ishimoto, Second Section Chief of the Kwantung Army, issued the following statement today in the form of a conversation: "At the Changchun meeting, the Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison Army reported on the local situation and discussed future policies. The current situation is proceeding in the direction Japan hopes for. The Japanese side does not want to expand the incident or cause disturbances. Moreover, the Chinese side has almost accepted the Japanese demands regarding the Chahar issue and is currently implementing them." (19th Dentong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Ishimoto, Foreign Affairs Section Chief of the Kwantung Army, issued the following statement today regarding the Kwantung Army's attitude toward the North China issue: "On the 17th, the military staff and local military officers held a joint meeting. Colonel Sakai and others reported on the local situation. As a result, it was decided that no further action would be taken against North China. The Zhangbei incident is also expected to be resolved satisfactorily." (19th Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Tianjin news, Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, the Japanese military officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, originally planned to arrive in Tianjin yesterday, but later changed to waiting in Shenyang for Colonel Sakai, Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Japanese Army, to return to Tianjin by the same train. He arrived in Tianjin this morning and immediately reported the results of the Changchun meeting to Doihara. Later, it was said that Doihara and Qin Decun would discuss the Zhangbei incident in Tianjin. It was also heard that Song Zheyuan would go to Tianjin within a few days to participate in the discussion. (19th Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army held an informal meeting of retired advisors today. Advisors Araki, Matsui, and Abe all attended. Army Minister Hayashi reported on his impressions of inspecting Manchuria and Korea. Deputy Army Minister Hashimoto reported on the North China issue. Each advisor understood.

<h3 id="e2">Japan Acknowledges that the Nine-Power Treaty Has Been Eliminated in Fact <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Refuses to Allow Britain and the United States to Intervene in the Hebei Incident</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the visit of British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to the United States Department of State on the 17th, according to the Washington Post, Britain and the United States want to form a common front and invoke the Nine-Power Treaty to contain Japan's actions against China. Britain and the United States will take concrete actions in a few days. Japanese diplomatic authorities hold a calm attitude towards this, believing that it is not worth a knowing smile. Although Britain and the United States are paying considerable attention to the Hebei issue, apart from Britain ordering its ambassador to Japan to listen to information from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, neither government has taken any positive action against Japan in any form. Even judging from the actions of the British Foreign Secretary in the British Parliament on the 17th, Britain and the United States seem unlikely to take any positive action in the future. Therefore, Japanese diplomatic authorities believe that this is a useful plot. In the unlikely event that Britain and the United States work together, invoking the Nine-Power Treaty and protesting to Japan, they will resolutely reject it from the following perspectives: (1) The Hebei issue has been resolved by the parties concerned, China and Japan, and cannot be interfered with by other countries. (2) The Nine-Power Treaty that Britain and the United States want to invoke cannot be recognized by Britain and the United States as using the treaty as a shield to speak to Japan on the Hebei issue. (3) Japan believes that the effectiveness of the treaty has been eliminated in fact since the Manchurian Incident. (19th Dentong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared here today that he has not yet received any new news regarding the Sino-Japanese situation that would permit criticism. Various messages from Tokyo, Nanjing, and London are now making the State Department more cautious in considering diplomatic moves. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Italian Ambassador Rosso has had contact with the State Department. It is generally believed that Rosso's visit was to inquire about the attitude of the United States government on the Sino-Japanese issue. It was later claimed that this move was decided by him personally. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, it touched on the situation in North China where China and Japan were holding each other in check. Conservative MP Ball-Rose asked the Foreign Secretary whether, in view of the development of China, which would have a serious impact on world peace and security, he would consider taking steps with other countries to reduce the current damage to treaties occurring in the Far East. Foreign Secretary Hoare replied that he was currently inquiring into all the facts, and he could not proceed with consideration until he had fully ascertained the truth. Labour MP Jones then asked whether Britain should now be in close contact with the United States regarding developments in China. The Foreign Secretary replied, "Of course." The Foreign Secretary later replied to a question from Conservative MP Ball-Rose, saying that the British government had no obligations to the integrity of China other than those related to the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty. Labour MP Williams stated that Britain was one of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty and wanted to know whether Britain had an obligation to intervene in this dispute. If Britain had no such obligation, what was the value of signing the treaty? The Foreign Secretary replied that he would not be able to answer such a broad question until the truth was known. The Foreign Secretary then replied to a question from Labour MP Carter, saying that he was not currently stating whether Japan's actions in North China could be described as a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons today, an MP questioned the government's attitude towards the current events in China. Foreign Secretary Hoare replied, "The government is currently investigating the truth of the incident, but it is not convenient to issue any new statement before the facts are fully understood." Another MP questioned the government as to whether it was maintaining close contact with the United States government on this issue. Hoare replied in the affirmative. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

A reporter from the Associated Press heard that leaflets had been found in Beiping saying that Sun Chuanfang would preside over a certain movement. He specifically visited Sun to inquire. In addition to denying this, Sun also said that this rumor might be a conspiracy by a certain party to incite disgruntled military and political figures to engage in reactionary work. He also said that he was deeply interested in Buddhism and did not want to intervene in politics or military affairs again. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tang Jinghai Recounts the Course of Departure from Guangdong</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Haiqi and Haichen dropped anchor and came to Hong Kong from the Cheung Chau waters at 9:00 a.m. on the 19th. After passing through the Lei Yue Mun entrance, Haiqi went first, followed by Haichen. A small launch dispatched by the Hong Kong Navy guided them and entered Hong Kong waters at 11:30 a.m., anchoring in the waters off Yau Ma Tei. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Haiqi and Haichen entered Hong Kong waters at noon on the 19th and docked off Central. Tang Jinghai, acting captain of Haiqi, said that the two ships left Guangdong because they were dissatisfied with Chen Jitang's control of the navy with the army. They had never contacted any party beforehand. When they were in Huangpu, they were bombed more than 200 times by Guangdong planes, but because the planes did not dare to fly low, none of them hit. When the two ships passed the Yuzhu Fort, they fired at the fort first, but the fort did not return fire. When they passed Humen, the two ships fired more than 100 cannons, but the fort only fired five cannons and did not dare to turn on the searchlights, so they did not hit. The two ships were not injured at all. Only Haichen had a small hole pierced by a small steel cannon fired by a land special operations team in Huangpu. There was absolutely no intention of surrendering. Yang Chaolun, the captain of Zhaoxin, was detained. Jiang Xiyuan was also arrested. Fang Nianci will succeed Jiang in the post of department head, and Li Qingwen is proposed to replace the naval principal left by Jiang. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The damage to the Humen Fort this time was minimal, but more than a dozen residents along the coast were killed or injured. More than a dozen people were also killed or injured in Huangpu. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The two ships Haiqi and Haichen entered the Hong Kong harbor at 12:30 p.m. today. Although they were shot at by the Humen and Huangpu forts, they were not significantly damaged. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The two ships Haichen and Haiqi arrived here from Guangzhou this afternoon. It is said that they will stay in Hong Kong for three days, purchase food and fuel, and then go north to Shanghai. The captain of the Haichen told reporters that in the autumn of national disaster, they would rather serve the country than support a faction, so they left Guangdong specifically. Haiqi has 650 sailors and Haichen has 350. When they dropped anchor from Huangpu and escaped from the Pearl River, the Humen Fort fired cannons at them, but the two ships did not appear to be greatly damaged. Haiqi's radio was shot down by the fort. A total of seven crew members of the two ships were injured. Three of them arrived in Hong Kong waters on the afternoon of Sunday and were taken ashore by a naval launch and sent to a government hospital. Yesterday morning, one of the two died from his injuries. Now we learn the details of what happened. The three ships Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaoxin had been brewing a mutiny for several months due to salary cuts and other reasons. On Sunday, the crew of Haichen and Haiqi suddenly revolted and detained several senior crew members who were unwilling to join the mutiny on the Zhaoxin. At 3:15 p.m., the leaders of the mutiny issued an order for the three ships to leave Huangpu at the same time. When the land authorities heard the alarm, they sent hundreds of troops to the riverbank and opened fire. The mutinous ships were not prepared to fight at that time, causing several sailors to be injured. At 5:00 p.m., the mutinous ships sailed to Ninghuadun. (Translation, the water there is shallow, so they waited for the tide to rise, so it was not until 1:00 a.m. at night that they were able to move forward. In order to prevent the planes from bombing, the mutinous ships falsely claimed to Guangzhou that they were willing to surrender. When the tide rose, the two ships went back to Humen and returned. Zhaokou could not follow due to grounding. When passing through Humen, the mutinous ships were shot at by heavy artillery at the fort, and planes dropped bombs in the sky, but the weather was dark and rainy, and the visibility was not good, so the planes could not hit the Haiqi with bombs. The fort bombarded each other until the mutinous ships passed the Pearl River Bay, and then stopped. The planes continued to chase, but they could not fight because it was dark and raining, so they flew back to Guangzhou. The two ships were able to safely leave the sea. On the afternoon of Sunday, the mutinous ships arrived near Hong Kong and did not enter the port until today and docked in Yau Ma Tei. According to personnel from the two ships today, everyone on the ship had the same opinion, and a small number of sailors who were unwilling to go north could disembark in Hong Kong. It is said that after Haiqi escaped from Guangzhou, some sailors disagreed with this move, leading to a dispute. When the incident occurred, Haiqi Fang Guan was in Guangzhou. Haiqi has a displacement of 4,300 tons, was built in 1898, and has a maximum speed of 21 knots. It is equipped with two 8-inch guns and ten 4.7-caliber guns. Haichen has a displacement of 2,950 tons, was built in 1897, has a speed of 19 knots, and is equipped with two 6-inch guns, ten 4.7-caliber guns, and eight 4.1-caliber guns. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The authorities have taken precautions in view of the naval mutiny. Senior naval officers have been slightly changed today. The fate of the 100 officers and soldiers from Guangdong on the mutinous ships is worrying. Fleet Commander Jiang Xiyuan and many other officers are still detained at the headquarters pending military trial. It is said that Guangdong Province can save at least 130,000 yuan per month after the two ships leave. According to reliable sources, Chen Jitang decided not to take the severe measure of destroying the mutinous ships because the warships are state property. When the mutiny first occurred, three methods were proposed to deal with it: (1) Send planes to drop bombs next to the mutinous ships as a warning; (3) Sink the Fu'an gunboat in the narrowest part of the Humen River to block the escape of the mutinous ships; (3) Place mines and launch torpedoes to sink the mutinous ships. After repeated consideration, it was decided to use the first measure and not allow bombs of more than 25 pounds to be used. This is why the mutinous ships were able to escape safely. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The two ships Haichen and Haiqi remained anchored outside Hong Kong's territorial waters last night. Hong Kong police said they were not paying attention to the matter and did not intend to interfere. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Ji</p>
<p>According to a recent London dispatch, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan have reached an agreement to each send financial representatives to China to investigate the state of our country's currency. The candidates from the UK and France have already been officially announced. Representatives from the United States, Italy, and Japan will also be appointed soon. Although this matter is still developing, and we cannot predict its future success, the Chinese economy has recently been greatly affected by the US silver policy, exhibiting extreme instability. The governments of various countries are concerned about this and are sending representatives to China to investigate our real situation and offer their contributions. Regardless of their future methods or purposes, this kind of international sympathy towards us is indeed worthy of our approval.</p>
<p>As a result of the high degree of development of capitalism, the world economy has long been integrated and inseparable. The safety or danger of one corner is always enough to affect the overall situation. Therefore, for the sake of progress in international peace and interests, cooperation and mutual assistance in all aspects are also very urgent. It is a fact that our country has been in a state of disrepair in recent years due to economic panic. We are unwilling to avoid treatment. Therefore, the Chinese people have expressed considerable welcome to the economic investigation teams from various countries coming to China. This is because China is currently in a period of awaiting many things to be handled, and all kinds of construction matters rely on the material and technical assistance of various countries. However, "using foreign power" is by no means the same as "relying on foreign power." Currency is the center of a country's economic life, and its impact on national independence and survival is very great. It must not be subject to the constraints of other countries. At present, the great powers often use their financial policies to rule over various weak and small national countries, such as the United States in Cuba and the United Kingdom in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and other countries. If, as reported by foreign telegrams, representatives of various countries all want to bring Chinese currency under their own sphere of influence, is this not intended to compete for economic leadership in the Far East?</p>
<p>We believe that the reform of China's monetary system is an extremely difficult matter. We should exhaust the wisdom of the entire nation, carefully consider the interests of all parties, make meticulous plans, and prepare thorough arrangements. It cannot be achieved by "building a house based on roadside advice." Moreover, since China is an independent country, no matter how the currency is reformed, it should have an independent currency position. It should not have any currency connection with any country, nor should it be tempted or threatened by any country to compromise. Otherwise, China may become a colony of the great powers in terms of finance, and the self-reliance and prosperity of the national economy will be even more difficult. Recently, Sir Frederick Whyte in England published an article in London saying that "China's survival depends solely on the strength of its national power." These words are truly worthy of our deep reflection.</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the issue of Japan refusing to participate in the discussion of currency problems in the Chinese capital, it is known from Far East sources that Japan is not opposed to the principle of discussing currency problems, but believes that this kind of discussion is not very appropriate under the current circumstances. Only after financial experts from Britain and France have completed a preliminary investigation of China's currency situation, and after Sino-Japanese relations are smoother, will they send financial experts to China. In fact, this matter is being exchanged between the Japanese Embassy and the British Foreign Office, and the Japanese government has not yet made a final decision. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance is currently preparing the budget for the 11th year of Showa. Finance Minister Takahashi will explain its contents at the cabinet meeting on the 21st.

<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada met with reporters at noon today and made the following statement: The harmony between finance and national defense is the most important thing. Whether the budget is increased or decreased is not a problem. The key is how to harmonize finance and national defense. Japan is currently active, and necessary expenses cannot be reduced, so there is no one who advocates reducing national defense expenditures. Judging from the current state of Japanese finance, national defense expenditures are not without being too heavy. However, it is indeed a necessary thing for national security and national defense. However, the issuing power of public bonds is limited, and the national economy cannot be endangered for this purpose. Therefore, it is necessary to harmonize finance and national defense. This issue will be carefully reviewed by the cabinet review committee and the investigation committee. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military have completely consistent opinions on the policy towards China, and the same is true for the policy towards Russia.

<p>(Tokyo) Because relations between Japan and Russia have improved since the establishment of the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Foreign Minister Hirota plans to permanently preserve this state. He is preparing to propose to Russia a plan for the establishment of a border dispute mediation committee, demanding the removal of the Red Army's defense work on the border, and the withdrawal of troops stationed in the Far East, as a preliminary condition for the signing of a non-aggression treaty. Ambassador Ota, stationed in Russia, attended the Paris ambassador meeting and has now returned to his post in Moscow. The Foreign Minister will instruct him to begin negotiations with the Russian government in the near future. According to the Foreign Minister's opinion, the atmosphere between Japan and Russia has improved. It is meaningless for the Soviet Union to send 300,000 troops to the Far Eastern border area, and it is harmful. The Japanese-Russian military conflict in the Suifenhe area the other day may occur again in the future. Now the Soviet Union should take the only measure, which is to withdraw or reduce its unnecessary troops stationed in the Far East. The Foreign Minister plans to advise our government to implement troop withdrawal, and then negotiate the peaceful handling of the border. This negotiation will be conducted by Ambassador Ota with Litvinov. (19th Japan United News Dispatch)</p>

(19th Den Tsushin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian ambassador to Japan visited Finance Minister Takahashi this afternoon to exchange views on Japanese-Russian relations. The meeting lasted for 40 minutes. Mr. Yurenev stated his opinions as follows: For the sake of maintaining peace in the Far East, and also world peace, it is the only way to increase the welfare of both countries for Japan and Russia to cooperate and strive for harmony and friendship in both political and economic aspects in the future. Fortunately, the problem of the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been resolved, and there is currently no conflict of interests between the two countries. Therefore, with Your Excellency's efforts in the future, friendly relations can be promoted, and it is hoped that the time for Japan and Russia to conclude a non-aggression treaty will arrive quickly. He questioned the Finance Minister's opinion. Finance Minister Takahashi replied: I deeply agree with your Excellency's opinion. In short, the major issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty cannot be resolved overnight. It is only possible to reach that time after the various pending issues between the two countries have been resolved satisfactorily. He hopes that the two countries will cooperate with each other to promote friendly relations on political and economic issues, and after various earnest talks, the meeting ended at 2:15 pm.

Mr. Daenery also said that during the recent period of financial panic in France, both the United Kingdom and the United States provided assistance. As for the Bank of France repeatedly raising the discount rate, its purpose is nothing more than to prevent speculative behavior. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Anglo-German Naval Agreement Quickly Signed and Announced, Eden to Go to France on Friday to Explain, Italian and Russian Experts Also to Be Invited to England <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) The terms of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement are detailed in the White Paper published today. The documents exchanged between the two governments feel that a good thing has been accomplished, but their work has not aroused much excitement in France. The Parisian newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction loudly. It is heard that the French government's note to the British government regarding the agreement will indicate that France intends to have a higher shipbuilding program. At the same time, British Minister of Disarmament Eden will go to Paris on Friday to discuss naval issues and the general situation in Europe with the French government. One of the most important points of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is that Britain allows Germany to have the right to place submarines in a tonnage equivalent to that of Britain. However, Germany promises not to exceed 45% of this type of warship except in extraordinary circumstances. If it needs to exceed, it must first consult with the British government. The British government said that this agreement will be of great importance to future naval restrictions, and it is believed that it can make it easier to establish a general compromise among the naval countries of the world. The ratio of Germany occupying 35% of the total tonnage of the British Navy is a permanent ratio and will not change due to the construction of warships by other countries. However, when there is a major reversal in the current balance of international forces, Germany can invite Britain to reconsider the new situation. If there are any changes in the future international naval situation, the allocation of tonnage for various types of warships that have been negotiated can be modified by the two governments through consultation. General Ribbentrop, the German representative, expressed his delight when the British government accepted this condition, saying that this agreement is permanent, practical, and will take effect immediately. However, France does not think so. The Tribune said that the agreement has put the German navy on an equal footing with France, and the parliament has to increase the construction of warships. The semi-official Times said that Germany allowed London to negotiate separately on two issues of great importance to British security, namely sky armaments and sea armaments, in order to split the Stresa Front of Britain, France, and Italy. General public opinion in France believes that Britain's permission for Germany to re-establish a navy equivalent to 35% of the British navy is a big mistake and will inevitably seriously affect its own security and world peace. Reuters diplomatic correspondent claimed that the clause in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement that is most noteworthy to London is the one regarding submarines. It is believed that British naval experts now hope that the concession given to Germany by Britain here can prevent Germany from building aircraft carriers. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The sudden establishment of a naval agreement between Britain and Germany has caused people to worry about the cooperative relationship between Britain, France, and Italy. France and Italy are not in favor of this move by Britain. However, Britain said that its actions were not intended to condone Germany's actions to violate the Treaty of Versailles. According to reliable sources, there is a secret condition attached to this treaty, that is, Germany guarantees not to build aircraft carriers. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was signed by Foreign Secretary Hoare on the British side and by Hitler's representative Ribbentrop on the German side. After signing this treaty, Hoare claimed that the signing of this treaty is sufficient to promote the resolution of general naval issues. (18th Guomin News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, representatives from Britain and Germany will hold talks to discuss Germany's shipbuilding program. These talks will continue until the end of the week. Germany's shipbuilding program will be completed within seven years according to the 35% ratio. (19th Hanes Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Although the Anglo-German naval talks have reached a compromise, they still need to continue to resolve the details regarding shipbuilding. France has now been invited to send experts to London to participate in the discussion to prepare for the holding of a major naval conference. Italy and Russia also appear to be invited to send experts here. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e36">Content of Anglo-German Agreement, Representatives of Both Sides Exchange Notes to Confirm <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Efforts to limit armaments and ease the political situation have made preliminary practical achievements in London today, because the Anglo-German Naval Conference has reached complete agreement and signed a naval convention. The full text of the agreement has been published simultaneously in London and Berlin tonight. This agreement has been confirmed by the exchange of documents by British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Special Envoy Ribbentrop. The content of the documents is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The German government's proposal that Germany's navy should account for 35% of the British sea tonnage in the future has been accepted by the British government. The British government recognizes that this proposal will make an important contribution to future naval restrictions, and believes that the Anglo-German agreement, which takes effect from today, is the final agreement signed by the two countries and is conducive to the signing of general naval treaties by various naval countries.</p>
<p>(2) The British government subsequently endorsed the German representative's declaration on the implementation of this principle. The summary of this declaration is as follows: (A) The number of 35% is a naval ratio of a permanent nature. The total tonnage of the German navy will never exceed 35% of the British Empire fleet, as stipulated in the treaty. If there are no explicit restrictions on this tonnage in the future, it will never exceed 35% of the actual total tonnage.</p>
<p>(B) If a general naval agreement is established in the future, and the relative naval strength of each country is not specified, then Germany will not insist on including this ratio in the agreement, provided that other countries fully guarantee the maintenance of this ratio.</p>
<p>(C) Under any circumstances, Germany will maintain a ratio of 35%, but if other countries expand their navies indefinitely and disrupt the past naval balance, the German government reserves the right to invite the British government to consider the new situation.</p>
<p>(D) The German government advocates dividing battleships into several categories, and stipulating the maximum tonnage and maximum caliber of artillery for each type, and the German government accepts the ratio of 25% for various types of battleships, and is willing to modify this ratio according to the general naval treaty in the future. If a general naval agreement cannot be established in the future, the German government's right to change the 35% ratio shall be adjusted by a bilateral agreement between the German and British governments.</p>
<p>(E) If other countries want to combine cruisers and destroyers into one category, Germany can also do the same. However, Germany advocates classifying such ships.</p>
<p>(F) As for submarines, the total tonnage of all German submarines should be equal to the total tonnage of British submarines, but it will never exceed 35% of the total tonnage of the British Navy. Germany is willing to limit its total submarine tonnage to 45% of that of Britain, but it reserves the right to exceed 45% in case of emergency, but is also willing to negotiate this matter with the British government in advance.</p>
<p>(G) If it is impossible to apply the ratio of 35% to various types of warships, the tonnage of one type of warship should be transferred to other types of warships, so that Germany can make full use of its tonnage. However, this should be subject to the special agreement of the two governments, but it should not exceed the ratio of 35 to 100.</p>
<p>(3) The British government has learned of the reservations in the declaration and recognizes its right to agree to maintain the number of 35%. The two governments have no objection to this. In the letter, Ribbentrop also stated that the German government also recognizes that the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is the final valid agreement signed by the two governments, and it will take effect from today and will be able to promote the conclusion of general naval agreements by various countries.

<h3 id="e37">Eden to Visit France on Friday; Laval Expresses Welcome <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk, this morning presented Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval with the full text of the Anglo-German naval agreement and reported to Laval that British representative to the League of Nations, Eden, will come to France on Friday to discuss general European and specific issues with the French government. Laval immediately expressed his welcome to Eden's visit to France. After the British Ambassador left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Laval had a lengthy conversation with the Soviet Ambassador. According to well-informed sources, the two also discussed the Anglo-French naval agreement. This morning, newspapers competed to publish the Anglo-German naval agreement, along with detailed critiques. Nationalist newspapers heavily criticized Britain for negotiating with Germany alone, which dealt a blow to general conferences and the collective security system, claiming that the "Stresa Front" has finally been broken. They further stated that the large number of German submarines stipulated in the agreement is particularly disadvantageous to France, forcing France to increase its navy in the event of disputes with other countries. The newspapers also expressed regret that Italy has obtained a new opportunity to contend for naval supremacy with France, and warned that the restoration of the German fleet will cause unrest in the Baltic Sea, questioning why Britain does not alleviate this unrest for the continent. Bodinat, the international telegraph editor of the Paris Echo, also sternly criticized the British government and demanded that future naval negotiations be held in Paris, as Britain has disregarded French interests and France can no longer recognize Britain as an arbitrator. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government responded yesterday to the British note regarding the Anglo-German naval talks in London. The main points of the response are reportedly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The French reply stated that it is inappropriate to separate the naval issue from the overall arms issue.</p>
<p>(2) The reply stated that the objective of the Anglo-French joint declaration in London on February 2 was to comprehensively resolve all arms issues within the framework of a security system.</p>
<p>(3) France will have to determine the standard for its future naval construction plans based on the rate at which Germany implements its shipbuilding plan.</p>
<p>(4) The reply also requested clarification on how Germany will deal with the situation if the Soviet Union builds a navy. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Minister without Portfolio Eden is about to go to Paris to conduct talks with the French government. The Daily Telegraph reported that the objectives of the talks are roughly the following four items: (1) Germany has submitted a note to the signatories of the Locarno Treaty, stating that the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact conflicts with the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, which should be jointly answered by the signatories; (2) Whether there is any possibility of promoting negotiations on an "air Locarno" at present; (3) What new steps should be taken to seek a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia; (4) Whether there is progress on the issue of holding a security conference for the countries in the Danube River basin. In addition, Eden will invite French naval experts to Britain to prepare for Anglo-French naval talks, which will be attended by experts from Italy and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Prime Minister Baldwin plans to attend the general assembly and executive council meetings of the League of Nations in September of this year. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Minister without Portfolio Eden is scheduled to go to Paris on Friday to discuss naval issues with the French government. It is evident that Britain is eager to explain the actual results of the Anglo-German naval agreement to France. British people are very satisfied that the agreement will prevent Britain and Germany from engaging in naval competition in the North Sea as they did before 1914. Regarding submarines, it is generally believed that although Britain did not allow Germany to have submarine tonnage equal to Britain's, Germany has agreed that in peacetime, its submarine tonnage will not exceed 45% of Britain's. If the submarine tonnage exceeds 35%, the tonnage of other classes of warships must be reduced, which may also prevent Germany from building aircraft carriers. From an international perspective, the Anglo-German naval agreement has brought Germany back into the collective security system. Therefore, the naval agreement does not conflict with the policies advocated in the Anglo-French declaration of February 3 and the Stresa Conference communiqué. In addition, although Italy and France have objections to the Anglo-German naval agreement, submitting the German proposal to all countries for general discussion would likely delay the conclusion of the agreement and cause Germany to change its original proposal. As for whether France and Italy will change their naval construction plans in the future, Germany may not be able to immediately increase its naval tonnage, as Germany must obtain Britain's consent beforehand if it needs to increase its naval tonnage, which is clearly stated in the white paper.

<h3 id="e38">Observations from French Political Circles: Likely to Promote Air Force Convention <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) French political figures believe that the Anglo-German naval agreement is likely to impact the hope for the establishment of an air force convention. They feel it is inappropriate to independently conclude a naval agreement without progress on the issue of a general security system. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) After the conclusion of the Anglo-German naval agreement, it is rumored that the chief German representative, Ribbentrop, had talks with Minister without Portfolio Eden and proposed the conclusion of an air agreement with content similar to the naval agreement. However, what people can generally confirm is that the talks between Ribbentrop and Eden concerned matters other than naval issues, and not necessarily the air convention issue. Eden is scheduled to go to Paris on Friday, at which time he will inform French Prime Minister Laval of the results of the exchange of views between Britain and Germany. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The nationalist newspaper "Le Peuple" today commented on the Anglo-German naval agreement, with the title "The Death of the Stresa Spirit," saying that Britain's current action of snubbing France and Italy and making Germany complacent is difficult to understand. Smaller newspapers said that this agreement is a major victory for Germany, sufficient to strengthen Hitler's position in Europe, and is the most serious incident, enough to cause major disputes in Anglo-French relations. "Le Petit Parisien" said that the meaning of this agreement is that Germany's naval power will always be weaker than Britain's, so Britain spared no effort to achieve this unexpected great deal with the fastest means. Therefore, after the conclusion of this agreement, the position of the British cabinet will become more solid. Eden's mission to France seems to be to explain the alarm caused by the sudden conclusion of the Anglo-German naval agreement to the French. "Le Petit Journal" said that although this is a major victory for Hitler, it is also an achievement of the British Navy seizing the opportunity to benefit itself.

<p>(London) Members of Parliament have expressed satisfaction with the Anglo-German naval agreement. The opposition believes that this is a prelude to granting Germany complete equal rights in armaments. Most parliamentarians also see it as fortunate, believing that Britain's naval superiority in the North Sea can be maintained for some time as a result. The British cabinet has also gained a good pretext in election tactics, considering it a tool for victory. Therefore, the early rescheduling of the House of Commons election is an expected event. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German naval agreement has been welcomed in principle by newspapers today. The Times stated that both sides are willing to reach an understanding, so both sides have made concessions. The result is at least better than before 1914. The Morning Post stated that this agreement is indeed a satisfactory document in some respects, but it does not contain provisions limiting the number and tonnage of German submarines. Britain did not consult the signatories of the naval treaty before taking this step. The Daily Telegraph stated that it would have been more prudent for the British government to inform the French government of its views first, but this agreement can serve as the basis for more general negotiations in the future. The News Chronicle stated that this agreement is a major event in history and the first document in which postwar Germany has participated in arms limitation. The Daily Express stated that this agreement greatly contributes to disarmament and public peace. The Daily Mail stated that this agreement is a commitment by Britain and Germany not to engage in naval competition, so it is welcome. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph commented on the importance of the Anglo-German naval agreement, saying, "Germany's rearmament and the expansion of navies by countries in Europe and the Far East have created a new situation, and the North Sea has once again become an important strategic location. All of this has forced Britain to change its naval policy. Britain currently has 45 submarines, totaling 55,244 tons. By the end of next year, some of these will no longer be applicable, and this tonnage will be reduced to 52,700 tons. If calculated at 35%, Germany can build submarines up to 19,635 tons. However, the 12 submarines currently under construction, each of 250 tons, are not included in this figure. Furthermore, according to news from Germany, the country does not intend to build submarines of more than 800 tons in the coming years." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Hitler's Peace Policy: German Newspapers Consider it a Great Success <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party's official newspaper commented on the Anglo-German naval agreement today, considering it a major event related to the European situation. All previous disarmament negotiations in Europe have failed, but the success of this Anglo-German naval agreement has established a good model for the issue of disarmament. Moreover, this is a practical step for leader Hitler to open up the chaotic situation in Europe and establish a peaceful policy. Therefore, the conclusion of this agreement proves that with the sincerity of mutual understanding, any political problem can be easily resolved. Hitler's peace policy has swept away all rumors and suspicions about Anglo-German naval competition, and using only 35% of the British navy as Germany's coastal defense is the basis for Anglo-German understanding. The newspaper continued, "Hitler is a frank politician in Europe and has already achieved results because of this. As before, there was the success of rapprochement with Poland, and now there is the beginning of Anglo-German coordination, which are all the results of his peaceful advocacy and his ability to implement his advocacy."

<p>Vienna Responsible sources believe that after the conclusion of the Anglo-German naval agreement, Britain's general policy will not change. Although the German side is making great efforts to promote that Britain and Germany have reached a final agreement in London, sources here believe that the Anglo-German naval agreement should still be subordinate to the general naval agreement. In addition, Britain will continue to pursue its policy of consolidating international security organizations. A commentary in the "Daily Newspaper" stated, "The united front of Britain, France, and Italy established by the Stresa Conference is in no danger of breaking apart. Germany's victory is only superficial." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jevtić will soon meet with representatives of the Italian government, or perhaps even with Prime Minister Mussolini. Mussolini has now left Rome for Romagna for vacation, and it is possible that he will meet Jevtić there. It should be noted that Jevtić was originally scheduled to meet with Undersecretary Suvich in Venice on the 19th of last month, but Jevtić was unable to leave due to domestic political reasons in Yugoslavia, and the discussion was cancelled. What we should pay attention to is that Jevtić will be the chairman of the Small Entente Political Council at the end of this month, so he will visit Italy as a representative of the three countries of the Small Entente, and not just representing Yugoslavia.

<p>Lansing, Michigan Today, 380 inmates in a state-run coal mine here mutinied 720 feet underground, cutting all telephone lines to the surface, leaving only one line connected to the armory.

All mine entrances have been blocked. There are still eleven guards in the mine who have been detained by the prisoners. They also set fire near the armory in an attempt to smoke out the guards inside. According to the prisoners' representatives, who spoke to prison officials on the phone, the reason for the mutiny is to demand improved food and the removal of prison doctor Packer, because two inmates who suffered from appendicitis last month died after Packer performed surgery.

<h3 id="e73">Air Force Competition Between France and Germany <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Berlin Correspondence</p>
<p>"The future of Germany lies in maritime development," was the warning of former German Emperor Wilhelm II when he wanted to expand the navy, and it was also one aspect of the German national spirit before the European War. Now, Air Force Chief General Göring is loudly proclaiming, "Germany's destiny lies in the air!" To resolutely express his nation's determination, he has implemented "Aeronautical Mechanics" as a major course in all schools above the middle school level nationwide. However, simply talking about "Aeronautical Mechanics" is just empty talk, not the habit of the German people, and also not suitable for practical application. Therefore, they have gamified aviation. There are thirty national aviation game fields, and several thousand gliders (invented by the German Lilienthal) without engines. Eight thousand young people are practicing flying skills and learning glider operation. The Department of Aviation divides them into three levels: A, B, and C. Among them, the highest level, C, has no fewer than a thousand people whose skills can compete with those in France. In the future, many excellent aviators will inevitably emerge from these young people, and they will all be soldiers of the German Air Force.</p>
<p>Germany now has 260 airfields, of which 124 are ordinary commercial airfields, and the rest are military. The exact number of aircraft in Germany and its aircraft manufacturing capacity have not yet been publicly announced. According to the estimate of French Army Chief of Staff General Maurin, German aircraft factories can build fifteen fighter jets every day. According to the estimation of Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Defense Tukhachevsky, Germany currently has 3,700 military aircraft, 8,000 flying officers, and 52,000 airmen. In addition, 60,000 people have been selected and are undergoing rigorous airmen training. According to British estimates, Germany has about 1,700 aircraft, of which 600 are training aircraft, and the rest are scattered in various airfields, extremely secret and difficult for outsiders to see. Another noteworthy thing is that the number of workers at the Krupp factory has increased to 25,000. Whether they are manufacturing weapons, military supplies, or other things is also a mystery. Since the establishment of the Department of Aviation in 1928, France has strived for the unification of the air force. Except for the aircraft carried by naval aircraft carriers and the non-carrier-based aircraft belonging to the Naval Association, all are under the command of the Department of Aviation to form a huge air force. The strength of the French land-based air force includes 48 reconnaissance squadrons, 33 fighter squadrons, 32 bomber squadrons, and 18 balloon squadrons, with approximately 31,000 soldiers. The current total number of land-based aircraft is approximately 3,000, which will expand to 5,400 in wartime. At present, the promotion of civil aviation is being vigorously promoted, and the units under the Department of Aviation will also expand from the current 131 squadrons to 156 squadrons.</p>
<p>In terms of the current situation, the French Air Force certainly has an absolute advantage over Germany. However, natural resources are not very abundant, and the "human element" is even more inferior compared to Germany. It is necessary to find ways to supplement and reverse the current decline. Therefore, French politicians and diplomats, feeling disappointed after Germany gradually developed upward and withdrew from the League of Nations, and having some contradictions with Italy, had no choice but to turn to pull the Soviet Union into the League of Nations, and at the same time want it to become France's ally. Because the current Soviet fighter jets have increased three and a half times compared to four years ago, the flight speed has also doubled, and the effective combat radius has increased three times. The number of aircraft is not very detailed, but it is more than 2,000, and the remaining mechanized troops are no less than those of other European countries. However, the French General Staff still generally adheres to the saying "Adequate preparedness is always a guarantee of peace," so they try their best to advocate expanding and strengthening their own military equipment. Their views on the Franco-Soviet alliance are not very agreeable. Their opinion is that in 1914, the Russian army was defeated by Hindenburg, and from the 1917 revolution to the present, "the quality of the army has not seen much progress. They are not yet fully satisfied with the operation of agricultural machinery, and the control of railways has not yet been completed. The 'human' elements indispensable for building an air force are also not very well equipped. They also believe that 'Russians are innately unsuitable for aviation,' even if they have more than 3,000 aircraft, the actual combat effectiveness is to be discounted. However, today's France, its own strength, cannot completely maintain the status quo, that is, barely support, it has to rely on the Soviet Union, and expand its strength, in order to maintain its advantage over Germany.

<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the so-called Hebei issue and the Zhangbei incident successively occurred, rumors have been rampant. Regarding the Zhangbei incident, Matsui Gennosuke, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, and Qin Dechun, the Director of Civil Affairs of the Chahar Provincial Government, have repeatedly negotiated in Zhangjiakou, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places. Although the content is not easy to hear, the demands made by the Japanese side can only be regarded as consultations on opinions before obtaining the consent of the Japanese Kwantung Army. Therefore, after Matsui consulted with Qin Dechun in Tianjin, he went to Changchun on the 16th to report the progress of the consultation in Tianjin to the leaders of the Japanese Kwantung Army and offer resolution opinions. The Japanese Kwantung Army then telegraphed Sakai Takashi, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, to fly to Changchun on the 17th to participate in the meeting. On the 18th, according to a Changchun telegram received from related parties, the Japanese Kwantung Army's response to the Zhangbei incident has been decided to be the responsibility of Matsui, to negotiate and resolve directly with the Chahar provincial authorities according to the nature of the local incident. Matsui also flew back to Tianjin on the 18th, reported the progress of the Changchun meeting to Doihara, who was staying in Tianjin, and then continued to negotiate with Qin Dechun, the Director of Civil Affairs of Chahar, to seek a final solution. In the afternoon of the same day, at 4:00 PM, the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters specially convened an important meeting to discuss everything. Qin Dechun was also invited to attend temporarily.</p>
<p>It was not until 6:00 PM that it ended. Qin and Matsui will take the same car to Beiping tomorrow (the 19th) and return to Zhangjiakou. Continued report: Regarding the Zhangbei issue, the Chinese and Japanese sides negotiated in Tianjin for several days. The initial proposed solution was met with objections from the Kwantung Army. Iwai, Matsui, and Sakai requested instructions from the Kwantung Army Headquarters and left Tianjin for Changchun at noon on the 17th. He Yingqin, the Acting Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, telegraphed the Beiping Military Affairs Commission from Nanjing on the 17th, inquiring about the latest developments in the Chahar negotiations. The Military Affairs Commission replied in detail that evening, and the central government's response to the case and the progress of the Chahar provincial representatives' negotiations in Tianjin were also presented in detail by Men Zhizhong, the Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission, Yang Zhennan, the Secretary-General of the 29th Army, and Feng Zhi'an, the Commander of the 137th Division, who took the Ping-Sui train to Zhangjiakou this morning (the 18th) at 8:00 AM to report to Song Zheyuan, the Chairman of Chahar, in detail, and to coordinate with Song Zheyuan on the new handling methods of Chahar's military and political affairs. Generally speaking, the Zhangbei incident can be resolved after Matsui and Qin Dechun return to Zhangjiakou to continue negotiations. (The 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Southern Anhui Rapeseed Export: Short-Term Tax of 15/1000 Levied Specifically for Wuhu Municipal Construction Expenses <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Among the agricultural products of Southern Anhui, rice is the largest, and among the miscellaneous grains, rapeseed occupies the largest share. Each year, after the oil mills in various counties have used their fill, 300,000 to 400,000 piculs are collected in Wuhu for export. The only market is in the eastern neighbor. Due to diplomatic relations over the years, every time the new rapeseed enters the market, there is a trend of strikes and bans. However, due to overproduction, economic policies for farmers and merchants, and other reasons, the result is often a discretionary tax levy, and exports continue as usual. Japanese merchants also send people to Wuhu to sit and collect, as a customary practice. This year, the rapeseed harvest in various counties in Southern Anhui is particularly abundant. At this time of rural economic panic, finding a way out is even more urgent. After much hesitation, it was decided to continue the methods of the past two years, levying a public welfare donation on rapeseed exports, as a special fund for Wuhu local construction. This donation can collect 30,000 to 40,000 yuan each time. The expansion and construction of major roads such as Zhongshan Road Second Street in Wuhu all rely on this to be completed. Currently, the provincial government is preparing for the construction of Greater Wuhu, which requires even more expenses. The proposal to continue levying rapeseed export donations is welcomed by all parties. After Lou Daoxin, the Director of the Wuhu Public Works Bureau, telegraphed suggestions to both the Provincial Finance and Construction Departments, Yang and Liu, the two directors, consulted and agreed that rapeseed is a short-term business, and a short-term business tax should be levied. In order to take into account the undertakings that should be handled in Wuhu's municipal administration, the tax rate should be appropriately increased. After being presented to the provincial government for a meeting, it was decided to handle as proposed, and both the Finance and Construction Departments were ordered to jointly entrust the Wuhu Local Tax Bureau to collect the tax according to the agreed tax rate, and to appoint Lou Daoxin, the Director of the Wuhu Public Works Bureau, to establish an office to handle rapeseed export registration matters. After this provincial order arrived in Wuhu, the Local Tax Bureau and the Public Works Bureau actively prepared to start collecting, and Japanese merchants and grain merchants also began to take action.

<p>Changsha Correspondence: Japanese Dyson Chang Company merchant ships sailing on inland rivers often cause incidents. Recently, the company's Daji ship was sailing downstream in Changde. Due to its rapid speed, it sank a grain boat of the First Route Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression Army, containing 380 piculs of grain. Five boatmen, men and women, all drowned. Fortunately, nearby rowing boats were able to rescue them, preventing fatalities. The First Route Headquarters believes that the occurrence of this matter will affect the future of military food supplies. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Hunan Provincial Government, requesting serious negotiations with the Japanese Consul stationed in Hunan, ordering the Dyson Chang Company to compensate, in order to protect military food supplies. The original telegram is as follows: "According to the report of our headquarters' military grain escort officer, Huang Mingzhi Xiao Guigu, on the 9th of this month, we set sail at 9:30 AM on the 8th and arrived at Dalian Port at 1:30 AM on the 9th. We encountered the Dyson Chang Company's Daji ship, sailing downstream from Changde at high speed, which directly crashed and sank one of our civilian boats containing 380 piculs of grain. There were five boatmen, men and women, on board, all of whom drowned. There were many rowing boats in the area, and they were able to rescue them, preventing fatalities. I ordered the Daji ship that caused the accident to be escorted to Changde. In addition to requesting Chief Hu to investigate and compensate, I am reporting the facts to your attention and requesting that you seriously negotiate with the company and order them to compensate in full for the loss, in order to protect the military food supplies. I await your orders." The report from Hu, the resident Chief of the Administration Office of our headquarters in Changde, states that Huang Mingzhi arrived in Changde today with the grain, and according to him, at 1:00 AM last night, a grain boat was sunk by the Dyson Chang Daji ship in the Dayun Port of Yuanjiang, losing 380 piculs. The Daji ship has been detained. Please instruct on how to handle this situation. Therefore, in addition to telegraphing a reply, I have found that the ship belongs to a Japanese merchant, and I am hereby telegraphing you to request that you investigate and seriously negotiate with the Japanese Consul and order the company to compensate in full for the loss, in order to protect the military food supplies, and please reply for our information.

<h3 id="e77">Silkworm Industry in Jiangsu Province This Spring: Striving to Reduce Costs and Improve Quality, Hoping for Government and Social Cooperation to Control the Silk Industry <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Construction Department, noting that Jiangsu Province has vast areas suitable for mulberry cultivation on both sides of the Yangtze River, and that farmers in the counties along the Grand Canal in southern Jiangsu rely on sericulture as an important sideline, with the money flowing into rural areas each year, even with today's extremely low cocoon prices, still reaching more than 10 million yuan, which is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. In recent years, silk stocks have been sluggish and silver prices have soared, leading to a sharp drop in silk prices and economic hardship for farmers and merchants. To seek salvation, it is hoped that all related industries (breeders, silkworm farmers, cocoon merchants, silk merchants) can, under the current silk prices, strive to reduce costs and improve quality, struggle hard, support each other, and engage in rational management in order to survive. Therefore, the level of seed prices and cocoon prices should be related to the rise and fall of silk prices, and should never exceed this limit to obtain extra benefits. Otherwise, not only will they not be able to survive, but they will also increase the destruction of the entire silk industry. The reason is clear. The Jiangsu Construction Department, in view of this, organized the Sericulture Improvement Management Committee in the spring of the 23rd year, bringing together sericulture industry personnel to discuss and implement the control and management of the sericulture industry, in order to achieve harmony and connection among related industries. In the past year, the universal implementation of silkworm rearing guidance, the promotion and encouragement of high-yield varieties, the gradual normalization of cocoon brokerage operations, and the annual reduction of baking and reeling losses have all achieved significant results. The following is a record of the operations during the spring silkworm season this year.</p>
<p>Silkworm Seed Production</p>
<p>This year's spring seed, for the convenience of seed sales, various seed farms were allowed to buy and sell freely at the prescribed price (40 cents per sheet), and the government subsidized each sheet by 20 to 40 cents (this year, in order to encourage high-yield varieties, in addition to the Guizhu, Xin Gui, and Hua Wu Hua Liu varieties of mixed breeding, which are subsidized by the government at 20 cents per sheet, the Han Gui and Hua Wu Hua Liu varieties of mixed breeding are subsidized at 25 cents per sheet, the Xi Qiao Xi Qia and Hua Wu Hua Liu varieties of mixed breeding are subsidized at 30 cents per sheet, and the Hua Gui and Hua Liu varieties of mixed breeding are subsidized at 40 cents per sheet). The production volume in Jiangsu Province is estimated to be more than 800,000 sheets in spring and more than 400,000 sheets in autumn. Originally, it was stipulated that the spring production should be kept in the province and the autumn production should be exported. However, when the Jiangsu Construction Department inspected the silkworm seeds, it was discovered that various seed farms had failed to comply with the regulations and, without approval, had exported part of the spring production to Zhejiang Province, resulting in exports to Zhejiang reaching 600,000 sheets, leaving only 600,000 sheets in Jiangsu, which was difficult to meet the demand. The Jiangsu Construction Department immediately telegraphed various exporting farms and the Zhejiang Construction Department to withhold the seeds. However, because Zhejiang Province was hatching earlier and had a great need for seeds, part of them had already been shipped out, and because Zhejiang Province had reached an agreement with various seed farms in advance, after several consultations, only 10,000 sheets were withheld. This is the main reason for the shortage of spring seeds this year. In mid-April, the weather was sunny and the mulberry trees grew better, and the interest of silkworm farmers in sericulture increased greatly. In addition, due to the sudden warm weather in early spring, many local seeds hatched due to improper protection, and the need for improved seeds increased. The sales of these 631,800 sheets of silkworm seeds were not controlled and managed by the government, but entrusted to seed vendors by various farms, making it difficult to achieve proper distribution. Seed vendors manipulated the market, raised prices, and exploited farmers, which is deeply hateful. In order to relieve silkworm farmers and suppress price increases, the government had no choice but to order more than 31,000 sheets of silkworm seeds from Japan and transport them to various regions for sale to adjust the market. However, this move was unfavorable to seed vendors, resulting in the destruction of silkworm seed sales points on May 2. Although the incident was quickly quelled, the estimated shortage of silkworm seeds in the province still reached about 50,000 sheets). In order to improve the quality of silkworm cocoons, the Sericulture Improvement Management Committee stipulated high-yield and robust varieties and designated breeding areas, in order to unify the quality of fresh cocoons and reduce baking and reeling losses. The stipulated varieties are first and second generation hybrids, with the first generation being Guizhu, Xin Gui, Han Gui, Hua Gui, Xi Qiao Xi Qia, and the second generation being Hua Wu Hua Liu, and strictly prohibiting the breeding of pure varieties and other varieties.</p>

<p>This spring, Jiangsu Province has 2 centers in Wuxi and Jintan, and 13 improved areas in Wujin, Jiangyin, Yixing, Liyang, Danyang, Wuxian, Wujiang, Zhenjiang, Jurong, Yangzhou, Jiangdu, Changshu, and Jingjiang, all of which adopt a central guidance system. Based on the distribution of silkworm farmers in each county under the area office, central guidance stations are established to handle silkworm farmer surveys, disinfection of silkworm rooms and tools, joint hatching, joint breeding of young silkworms, and organization of sericulture cooperatives. In the central guidance area, silkworm rearing guidance stations are set up to guide silkworm farmers in silkworm rearing and mulberry planting, in order to improve silkworm rearing technology and rationalize management. The province has a total of 38 central guidance stations and 268 guidance stations.</p>
<p>Cocoon Brokerage Control</p>
<p>Since Jiangsu Province opened cocoon brokerages in the 17th year, the number of stoves has greatly increased, and the amount of fresh cocoons cannot correspond to the number of baking stoves, resulting in increased cocoon collection costs. Since the spring of the 23rd year, cocoon brokerage control has been implemented, so that cocoon brokerages can operate in an orderly manner, save unnecessary expenses, improve baking technology and cocoon collection organization, in order to reduce dry cocoon costs and improve quality.</p>
<p>In the spring cocoon season this year, in order to thoroughly implement cocoon brokerage control, the first step is to rectify cocoon brokerages. For all cocoon brokerages in the model area and improved area, the area will inspect the cocoon licenses. Those with licenses but no stoves will have their cocoon licenses revoked, and those with stoves but no licenses will have their stoves demolished. Cocoon brokerages with only single stoves of 4x4 or less, except for those that are indeed self-used stoves of cooperatives, will have their cocoon licenses revoked and the license fees will be refunded by the association according to their effective term. Half a month before the cocoon brokerages open, each area will estimate the amount of fresh cocoons produced in the current season, formulate the number of stoves of cocoon brokerages that are allowed to open, and submit them to the Sericulture Improvement Management Committee for approval and promulgation. After the approved number of stoves is promulgated, the registration of cocoon collectors will begin. All qualified cocoon brokerages can recruit cocoon collectors and register with each area to open and collect cocoons. Those who are not registered will not be allowed to open. If the number of registered stoves has reached the approved number of stoves, the registration will be closed. However, qualified firms that have not been able to register cocoon collectors in this session will still have the right to register and collect cocoons in the next session. In order to eliminate the malpractices of cocoon collection, it is strictly forbidden to use old scales, collect cocoons at night, and crack down on bad habits such as cocoon vendors, scalpers, and the use of small foreign copper coins to protect the interests of silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>Results of Operations</p>
<p>It is estimated that the province will produce about 300,000 piculs of fresh cocoons this spring. The average price of improved seed cocoons is 20 yuan per picul. The amount of cocoons collected from each improved seed by guided silkworm farmers ranges from 30 jin to more than 50 jin per sheet, with baking losses ranging from 300 jin to 270 jin, and reeling losses ranging from 410 jin to 360 jin. Compared with last year, there has been significant progress. This is due to the improvement of silkworm seeds, the standardization of varieties, and the improvement of silkworm rearing technology. (Note) Last year, the amount of cocoons collected from each improved seed was about 30 jin to 40 jin, with baking losses ranging from 300 jin to 280 jin, and reeling losses ranging from 450 jin to 400 jin. Now, if each silkworm farmer raises two sheets of improved seeds, they can collect about 80 jin of fresh cocoons, worth 16 yuan. After deducting the silkworm seed price of 80 cents and the miscellaneous expenses required for silkworm rearing of about 1.2 yuan, there is still a profit of 14 yuan. Although the cocoon price is low, the farmers in Jiangsu Province after the disaster have benefited greatly from this income. This can be proven by the fact that the agricultural warehouses in various counties after the cocoon market are redeeming the items they had pledged. Furthermore, according to the productivity of mulberry gardens in Jiangsu Province in recent years, each mu of mulberry garden can produce enough mulberry leaves to feed two sheets of improved seeds. According to the above calculation, the input per mu of mulberry garden is 14 yuan (the silkworm rearing time is short, and the profit comes from labor, so the silkworm rearing labor costs can be ignored). The income is not yet included. If compared with rice fields and cotton fields, it may not be much less. Therefore, sericulture is a good sideline that nourishes the countryside. In the future, if we can work hard to improve and standardize silkworm varieties, in order to reduce baking and reeling losses, then even if silk prices remain the same, cocoon prices can still rise accordingly. This is to be hoped for through the cooperation of the government and society to promote the success of sericulture control.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Cuttlefish Reproduction Experiment at the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Station – Experiment Location in Shengshan – <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Regarding the cuttlefish netting problem, the Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Station, after receiving orders to study it, immediately consulted with the Jiangsu Provincial Aquatic Products School and agreed on a cooperative approach. They jointly hired fishermen, equipped fishing boats and fishing gear, and borrowed the site of the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station in Shengshan as a research experiment location. They also sent personnel to live in Shengshan for a long time to conduct experiments. The Zhejiang station is responsible for the cuttlefish life history and reproduction experiments. The reproduction experiment uses tree branches, bamboo branches, rice straw, and other materials to sink to the seabed as objects for cuttlefish eggs to attach to, which is a good way to remedy overfishing. Chen Tongbai, the head of the station, took the Chaoyang ship to Shengshan on the 13th of this month to observe the reproduction experiment and guide the research methods of cuttlefish occurrence. He returned to Dinghai on the evening of the 16th. According to him, the results of the reproduction experiment are quite good. He estimates that if the government can use 1,000 yuan per year for reproduction, it can cultivate about 200 million eggs. With a survival rate of one-tenth, about 20 million adult cuttlefish can be obtained, and each hundred worth one yuan, then the total value is 200,000. This reproduction method is well worth trying. Director Chen also accompanied the fishing boats out to sea to observe netting and cage fishing methods. According to him, this year's first two waters of cuttlefish are not very abundant, and after the third water, there are almost no catches to be had. Although there are no statistics to illustrate, it can also be seen that the reduction of cuttlefish is quite obvious. Remedial measures are really unavoidable. (The 17th)</p>

<p>Zhu Xijian, the director of the Land Tax Collection Office, was accused of dereliction of duty and embezzlement of large sums of money. The county government arrested Zhu for the second time and detained him in the Public Security Bureau, awaiting investigation. County Magistrate Wu said that Zhu had embezzled 40,000 yuan in tax money during his tenure and refused to hand it over. It was planned to seal up his residence (in Youlan Lane) to offset the debt. However, the house is only worth more than 10,000 yuan, which is far from enough. Therefore, a secret investigation of hidden assets is underway. It is said that Zhu may be sent to the province for interrogation. Before the case was closed, another case arose. Zhu Xiangbo, the director of land tax collection in Dongting East Mountain, was also found to have committed a major corruption case. Zhu Xiangbo was arrested and sent to Suzhou on the 18th, and detained in the Security Brigade headquarters.

<p>Executive Committee Member Wang Bailing believes that the abolition of sail transport at Twelve Forts has had a huge impact on the Yangzhou city market. He has jointly requested the dredging of the Shahe River outside Dongguan City with Miao Qiujie, the Salt Transport Envoy of Lianghuai, and Jin Xiangsheng, the Deputy Salt Transport Envoy of Huainan, based on the proposal of local resident Hu Zhi, so that people and goods between Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and Suzhou can be transported here, directly revitalizing Yangzhou's industry and commerce, and indirectly transferring the livelihoods of the former workers of the Twelve Forts salt affairs. It is heard that the dredging fee of the river and all expenses for converting the old earth dam into a ship lock will require at least 520,000 yuan. This amount may be approved by the Ministry of Finance and the National Economic Commission, allowing it to be withdrawn from the national treasury. It is now learned that Committee Member Wang and others have specially drawn up maps and engineering plans and sent letters to various water conservancy experts and local officials and gentry, soliciting opinions. In addition, the Ten Forts Salt Maintenance Association previously strongly advocated for wheel-sail transport and requested a delay in the implementation of the sail reduction measures. The Ministry of Finance did not approve it, and they recently submitted another appeal, while also delegating representatives Duan Zhizhou and Wu Bingcheng to submit reports to the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Provincial Federation of Commerce, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, the Zhenjiang Shipping Association, and other organizations, requesting unanimous assistance in forwarding the request to the Ministry of Finance to postpone the sail reduction measures until after the implementation of the new salt law, and to approve the wheel-sail transport agreement, so that hundreds of millions of fort workers can be revived and their livelihoods maintained.</p>

<p>Dasheng Third Factory in Changle Town, Third District, experienced a strike on the 7th of this month due to layoffs and wage reductions. Party and government agencies sent people to persuade them repeatedly, but they still did not resume work. At 10:00 a.m. on the 17th, Shi Yuwen, a member of the County Party Committee and instructor of the Third Factory Trade Union, went to the Third Factory and gathered workers in the old drill ground for instructions and to solicit opinions from the workers.

<p>To the Editor, I am writing to you regarding the Songjiang correspondence published in your newspaper on June 15th, "Another Kidnapping Case in Fengjing." It stated that Qian Qichang, a farmer in Fanbang Township, Fengjing, at the intersection of Songjiang and Qingpu, was robbed the night before last by more than 20 bandits speaking with a Chaohu accent, each carrying sharp weapons. They kidnapped Qian Qichang's eight-month-old son and a worker, along with all the small boats, and so on. Upon investigation, the county village and Miao mentioned in the report do not exactly match the facts. It has been found that I live in Sanhe Village, Fifth Bao, Xin Town, Third District, Qingpu County. At about 12:00 a.m. on the night of the 11th of this month, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came, speaking in mixed accents and holding guns. They broke into my house and went straight into the workers' bedroom, tying up six workers including Cai Shengtang, arbitrarily beating them, and forcing Cai Shengtang to lead them to my wife Qi Shen's bedroom. They kidnapped my wife and my eight-month-old child Haoran, along with the worker Cai Shengtang. The bandits drove an awning boat halfway and released my wife Qi Shen and Cai Shengtang one after another, ordering them to prepare money to redeem my eight-month-old son Haoran. When they opened the boat, they also robbed one of my agricultural boats. Fortunately, I stayed in the new Shangzhen Town and was not affected. I am now afraid of misunderstanding and request correction. Please investigate accordingly. I am, sincerely, Qi Qichang of Sanhe, June 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Domestic Goods Production and Sales Greatly Increased, Attention to Sales in Border Areas, Develop Overseas Markets <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that domestic goods have been promoted and used by all sectors in recent years, and both production and sales have greatly increased. The future of the industry is very bright. It is now known that the industry is paying attention to sales in the border provinces and regions on the one hand, and is considering the development of overseas markets on the other hand in order to actively promote sodium. The Central News Agency reporter learned the details from the domestic goods industry as follows:</p>
<p>Suitable for Production and Sales Supply and Demand</p>
<p>In the past, domestic goods manufacturers only sought low costs and easy sales for the production of goods, resulting in unsustainable materials and loss of faith among buyers, which made foreign goods sell well in the market. In recent years, they have gradually considered the selection of high-quality materials and strived for cleanliness. Therefore, there has been a gradual improvement in recent years, but shoddy products have not yet disappeared. It is now known that in order to increase the faith of buyers of domestic goods, leaders in the industry have decided that the industry will supervise and urge each other on the quality of outgoing goods. At the same time, the output will also be controlled to make the supply and demand suitable to avoid the accumulation of inventory and increased costs.</p>
<p>Agreed on Methods for Promotion</p>
<p>Regarding sales, we are currently discussing how to increase sales day by day. There are various methods. The current methods used include (1) uniting with various guest gangs to promote goods to the mainland; (2) organizing domestic goods promotion groups to go to the mainland for exhibitions to make the public understand the difference between domestic goods and foreign goods, and the price and quality of domestic goods (3) setting up domestic goods companies in larger cities in the mainland to promote sales, etc. Other sales methods are still under discussion and progress, so that compatriots across the country can purchase and use domestic goods and restore interests.</p>
<p>Mainland People Are Happy to Purchase</p>
<p>Now, people in various places are increasingly aware of the low price and high quality of domestic goods, which are better than imported goods, so the purchase of old goods is also gradually increasing. As for the border provinces and regions, foreign goods are sold everywhere in recent years due to the dumping of foreign goods in the mainland. Since the domestic goods promotion groups went to exhibit, the public's willingness to purchase domestic goods in the area has increased significantly. Therefore, the business communities in major cities in Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces have contacted the domestic goods industry in this port to negotiate methods of promoting domestic goods, and several places have signed distribution contracts.</p>
<p>Actively Promoting Sales Overseas</p>
<p>The domestic goods industry has also been actively promoting overseas sales in recent years. For example, in Southeast Asia, last year, Englishman Mr. Speaker purchased a large batch of domestic goods in Shanghai and transported them to Southeast Asia by special ship for promotion. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have expressed their welcome. Following him, there were other Englishmen, Smith, etc., who were able to obtain huge profits. However, the high import taxes in various places have a considerable impact. Among the domestic goods industry, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have welcomed domestic goods, so they will discuss continuing to transport and sell them.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that Huang Fu, chairman of the Political Consolidation Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Ping, was invited by Premier Wang on the 15th and accompanied Wang Kemin, a member of the Political Consolidation Committee, to Beijing. He made suggestions on national affairs. After Huang left Ping and went south this time, he was unable to return to the north to perform his duties due to illness. He had previously submitted his resignation twice. The National Government ordered the special appointment of Wang Kemin, a member of the committee, as acting chairman a few days ago. Huang and Wang returned to Shanghai together yesterday morning after completing their official duties in Beijing. Huang decided to stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Mogan Mountain for recuperation. Wang will return to the north to perform his duties within days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Together</p>
<p>Huang and Wang took the overnight express train from Beijing together at 11:00 p.m. the night before and arrived at Zhenru at 7:05 a.m. yesterday. They immediately switched to a car and returned to Huang's private residence on Qiqi Road for rest. Wang had a brief breakfast at Huang's residence before heading to Xu's residence on Xiaoshadu Road for a temporary stay. Huang was also accompanied by He Jiecai, Wang Dagang, secretary of the Political Consolidation Committee, and Xu Hongbin, a counselor, and others. Mayor Wu visited Huang's residence on Qiqi Road yesterday morning to visit Huang.</p>
<p>Huang's Attitude</p>
<p>Regarding Huang's future actions, according to Huang's aides, Huang's arm disease has improved slightly, but it has not fully recovered. As for his nasal disease, there has been no good progress. Therefore, Huang came here to continue to seek medical treatment in Shanghai and examine his body. Once the weather is slightly hotter, he will go to Mogan Mountain for recuperation. There is no definite date for when he will take up his new post as Minister of the Interior. The internal affairs of the department are still handled by the two vice ministers, Tao and Xu.</p>
<p>Wang Will Go North</p>
<p>As for Wang's arrival here, it is to take care of personal matters and prepare luggage. He is scheduled to go north to perform his duties within days.

<h3 id="e103">Relying on Foreign Goods for Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation; Annual Need Exceeds 400 Million Yuan; Imports Occupy Over 60 Million Gold Units in Five Months; The Only Remedy is for Compatriots to Advocate Using Domestic Products <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to a Xin Xin News Agency report, Wang Boyan, a specialist at the International Trade Bureau's statistics department, told a Xin Xin News Agency reporter that Shanghai's foreign trade reaches between twenty and thirty million customs gold units per month. Imports exceed exports by over ten million gold units per month, making it the largest import surplus port in the country. In the first five months of this year, its import value reached 145,077,712 gold units, and its export value reached 105,442,648 gold units, resulting in a huge import surplus of over 39,630,000 gold units. An analysis of the nature of the imports reveals that clothing, food, housing, and transportation items constitute the largest proportion, followed by luxury goods, and then production goods. In the past five months, Shanghai's reliance on foreign goods for clothing, food, housing, and transportation amounted to over 63,630,000 gold units. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Clothing: Cotton goods 2,874,134, cotton 11,771,081, wool products 4,222,112, silk goods 1,449,980, hemp goods 1,136,348, cotton yarn 453,742, leather goods 486,369, totaling 22,393,766 gold units.</p>
<p>Food: Sugar 2,118,185, rice 11,332,609, flour 61,779, grains 28,704, seafood 1,404,615, meat products, etc. 1,686,970, totaling 16,632,362 gold units.</p>
<p>Housing: Construction hardware 14,045,178, timber 5,485,452, stone and clay 7,511,099, glass 378,594, totaling 20,370,323 gold units.</p>
<p>Transportation: Gasoline 2,479,607, automobiles 1,703,135, bicycles 17,721, other vehicles 33,474, totaling 4,233,937 gold units.</p>
<p>The above four items total 63,630,388 gold units, accounting for 43.8% of Shanghai's total imports in the past five months. It is worth noting that in our country, which is founded on agriculture, we should not have to rely on foreigners for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Of the above items, only construction hardware and gasoline have to be imported because the domestic steel industry is not well-developed and gasoline cannot be refined. The remaining goods can all be self-sufficient. Yet, we must rely on foreigners, spending hundreds of millions of customs gold units annually, equivalent to over 400 million yuan (national currency), to exchange for essential materials such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. How can we prevent the bankruptcy of rural areas? The remedy should first focus on advocating the use of domestic products for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo liner, Xinjiangtian, is reorganizing the stewards, abolishing the extra stewards of the cold water shift. Because they opposed the registration, General Manager Liu Hongsheng has suspended the Xinjiangtian liner since Tuesday. However, the stewards on board still remain on the ship, refusing to leave, in order to confront the company. Now, the company has decided that the Xinjiangtian liner stewards will only be allowed to have 172 people according to the regulations, and all stewards outside the quota will be cancelled. Registration and inspection will be used as the standard for selection. Stewards must strictly abide by the regulations on duty on the ship, and passengers must not be extorted for alcohol tips. The stewards still do not accept this method, so the ship is still not in service today. It is prepared to negotiate with the stewards today. If they still do not comply, further measures will be taken. It is also said that the Xinjiangtian will be transferred to the Yangtze River and will no longer sail to Ningbo.</p>

<p>The China Merchant Ship Drivers' Federation, the China Marine Engineers' Federation, and other seafarers' organizations believe that the Shanghai Shipping Association's decision to cut the salaries of crew members of all member companies earning more than 15 yuan by 20% starting on July 1 is a matter of vital importance to the livelihood of seafarers and have opposed it. The atmosphere is very tense. It is learned that Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shipping Association, is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Yong today to discuss a solution. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Crew Members of Various Ships Await Mediation</p>
<p>Sanbei, Ningshao, Dada, Datong, and other shipping companies have recently requested a reduction in crew salaries from the Shipping Association to maintain operations due to the decline in shipping. The association decided that starting from July 1, the salaries of crew members earning more than 15 yuan will be reduced by 20% across the board and has requested the government to issue public bonds of 10 million yuan for relief. This has led to opposition from various seafarers' organizations, which believe that the salaries of Chinese ship crew members are already very low and far from the treatment of European and American crew members. If this is implemented, the lives of seafarers will inevitably be greatly affected. Therefore, they have jointly gathered to discuss and issued a declaration of opposition. It is learned that Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shipping Association, has returned to Yong to avoid birthday celebrations and has not yet come to Shanghai, so the two sides have not yet formally negotiated. There is also</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>no correspondence. The crew members of various ships are currently waiting for the various seafarers' organizations to resolve the matter in accordance with the law and have no other actions for the time being.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Returns to Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shipping Association, will be 69 years old on the 15th of this month. In order to avoid celebrations from all parties and to save expenses, he returned to his ancestral home in Yong. The issue of crew salary cuts has not been formally discussed. It is learned that Yu will return to Shanghai on the Ningxing ship this morning. Seafarers' organizations in the city are also scheduled to send representatives to the Shipping Association at 9:00 AM today to demand that the original wages be maintained in order to avoid disputes. It is also learned that the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seafarers will convene a meeting this Saturday to discuss how to deal with the matter.</p>
<p>Jointly Requesting Relief from the Central Government</p>
<p>The China Marine Engineers' Federation, the China Drivers' Federation, the Radio Officers' Welfare Association, and other seafarers' organizations have issued a declaration opposing the Chinese merchant shipping companies' crew salary cuts. In addition, organizations such as Yanying Nanshe, New Taikoo Cargo Handling Club, Beijun'an Sailor's Guild, Yanying General Agency, Nanjun'an Sailor's Charity Association, Navigation Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Association, Chinese Navigation Drivers' Federation, Sanbei Hongan Cargo Handling Club, Navigation Lianyi Association, Yihe Cargo Handling Club, and Liyixuan Lodging House have jointly opposed the Shanghai Shipping Association's announcement of crew salary cuts.

<p>The Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, in view of the fact that the Wusong River has been in disrepair for many years and is becoming increasingly silted up, previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to request the Ministry of Finance to approve the allocation of funds for dredging. However, the Yuji Pier section in West Shanghai needs to be straightened and a new channel needs to be opened, requiring the requisition of more than 300 mu of civilian land. The farmers there have repeatedly opposed it and jointly requested the city government and the Municipal Farmers' Association to provide relief in order to maintain the livelihood of the farmers.

<p>Lawyer Xu Yi, residing at No. 17, Lane 71, Tangshan Road, has been practicing law in Shanghai. Recently, together with his younger brother Xu Yiming, his father-in-law Zhao Dong, and Ye Rumei, he was sued by Li Quanshen, manager of the China Gengtai Hehe Flour Mill, and lawyers Li Shirui and Li Lin for stealing seals, fraud, breach of contract, etc. in the First Special Court, with attached civil lawsuits. The reasons for the prosecution stated that the defendant Xu Yi, while practicing law, also served as a staff member of the plaintiff Gengtai Hehe Flour Mill and had established Rongxingkang Coal Company to purchase coal raw materials for the Gengtai Mill. As of January of the 23rd year, Gengtai owed the Coal Company more than 30,000 yuan. He continued to issue Xu Yi 21 checks, which could not be cashed upon maturity. The amount, plus interest, calculated to the end of December, totaled more than 37,000 yuan. Xu then requested Gengtai to replace the November 10th checks with three papers, which were issued by the accounting room Ye Rumei. However, the original 11 papers have not been returned. The Gengtai Mill refused to cash them because it could not pay one paper twice. In January of the 23rd year, Xu Yi, claiming to be the Zhonghe Bank, used the name of the legal representative Zhao Pei to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court, accusing Gengtai manager Li Quanshen of abusing checks and fabricating facts to deceive the court. He won the lawsuit and intensified his efforts to request the seizure of the residences of Cheng Linsheng and Cheng Yize in order to obtain illegal benefits. Fortunately, the court saw through his deceit and did not execute it. The plaintiff Li Quanshen believed that the above-mentioned three papers should not be cashed and should request the court to investigate according to law. On the previous day, magistrate Jiang Shuzi ascended to the criminal court to conduct a joint interrogation. First, the plaintiff stated the above, and only the defendants Xu Yi and Xu Yiming appeared in court. According to the supply, the item check was transferred by Xu Yiming to Zhao Pei. Because it could not be cashed, Zhao filed a lawsuit in court, and the plaintiff's director Xu Yi buried it on behalf of Zhao. He reconciled in court. The court asked Xu Yi whether the lawyer's power of attorney issued by Zhao Pei was written by him. Xu admitted that several were written by him and asked where Zhao Pei was now. Xu Yi replied that his documents were collected by lawyer Wang Jianhang, and Wang was also in court today, please ask him directly. Wang Jianhang was summoned to court and said that Zhao Pei was now in Suzhou. Magistrate Jiang reviewed the situation and believed that the content of the case was complicated and still needed to be testified and the previous case files transferred. He then ordered a rescheduling for further interrogation at 2:00 pm on the 28th of this month. Xu Yi paid 5,000 yuan bail and, before submitting a formal bail bond, was temporarily entrusted to his defense lawyer He Baqian to be responsible for bailing him out, and was limited to submitting a bail bond the next day.</p>

<p>Shi Agen from Yangzhou, residing at No. 11, Lane 320, Meizhou Road, planned to move elsewhere at about 6:00 am on the 8th of this month, but the landlord, Xu Jintao, a local, and his wife and son Hao Liang refused, saying that he had to repay the 10 yuan usury loan he had guaranteed. They quarreled with each other. As a result, he was violently beaten, suffered serious injuries, and fell to the ground crying for help. Hua Pu and detectives of No. 2494 arrived and, when Xu Jintao and his wife took the opportunity to escape, arrested their son and took him to the Yangshupu Police Station for detention. The injured person was sent to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The next morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court. Because Shi Agen's injury had not yet arrived, Wang Yaotang stated the previous situation and requested an investigation. Subsequently, the victim Shi Agen claimed that the defendant's father had guaranteed only 10 yuan for the loan and should not have beaten him so severely. He still felt abnormal pain in his head and chest and demanded that the defendant be punished. Xu Haoliang claimed that he had beaten his mother first at the time and begged for forgiveness while evading the issue. Magistrate Wu ordered him to be detained again and scheduled a sentence. Shi Agen was sent to the forensic office to examine the injuries.</p>

<p>The road conditions of Luban Road in Lujiawan, Nanshi are poor, and dust is flying. More than 70 merchants and residents, including the Meiya Dyeing and Finishing Factory, Guanghua Textile Factory, Dalai Nanhua Firm, and Changle Chinese Pharmacy, have separately submitted petitions to the Public Works Bureau, Health Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau, urging them to repair the road, sprinkle water, and reduce the speed of public buses. The petition to the Public Works Bureau stated that the merchants and residents have lived on Luban Road for many years, but the decline of the market is all due to the poor road conditions. When it is sunny, dust obscures the eyes; when it rains, mud covers the ankles. Pedestrians regard it as a dangerous road, and commerce cannot develop. We eagerly hope that the Bureau will repair the road, and we are leading without a day. Before the Public Utilities Bureau had repaired the road, it abruptly put public buses into operation on May 1st. For the sake of prospering the market, the transportation aspect can be said to be very beneficial. However, the merchants and residents on both sides are even more burdened by the ravages of dust and sand. Drivers are inconsiderate and only seek speed. Therefore, every car that passes raises dust over the eaves. This goes back and forth, and there is no peace for a moment all day long. Therefore, we urge the Bureau to quickly repair the Luban Road route and request that the Public Utilities Bureau reduce the speed of travel before the road is repaired in order to benefit merchants, travelers, and travelers, and be moved by virtue.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Maid Sent to Relief Association for Care <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Huang Adong, a woman from Jiaxing, is 15 years old. Her parents died when she was young. At the age of nine, she was sold by her clan uncle to Huang Houliang, the owner of Dechangqin Cloth Shop at No. 9, Tongfang Lane, Fujian Road, as a maid for 70 yuan. It has been six years since then. On the morning of the previous day, Huang suddenly fled and threw himself to the Laozha Patrol House requesting relief. After the patrol was dispatched, Detective Yin Sijiu was ordered to investigate. According to the woman, she had been raped three times by her owner since the winter solstice of last year, and she escaped to seek freedom because she could not bear the suffering. The patrol house, being inconvenient to deal with, sent her to the criminal court of the First Special District Court for disposal yesterday morning. The patrol house's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the previous situation and said that Huang Adong was only 15 years old and her development was not yet complete, but she suffered such trampling. Unless Huang herself sues, the patrol house will pursue the matter. Qian Hongye, the court president, questioned Huang. According to her, she was treated well since she was sold to Huang Houliang's family. The court questioned whether she had been raped twice and whether she wanted to sue. She replied that she had indeed been raped once, but did not want to sue. She went to the patrol house yesterday with the owner's concubine. President Qian then ordered Huang Adong to be sent to the Relief Association for care.</p>

<p>China News Agency reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government, according to a submission from the Provincial Women's Association, stated that factories and businesses in various places use women's photos to publish advertisements, which not only deliberately insult women, but also have strange shapes and shameful attitudes, greatly affecting public morality. Now, when the New Life Movement is being implemented and the promotion of benevolence, righteousness, and morality is being advocated, it is even more inappropriate to play tricks and insult women and harm public morality. It is requested to forward it to the central competent authority for strict prohibition and separate bans. The provincial government forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry for verification and handling. The Ministry of Industry, considering that the case is related to customs, specially discussed it with the Ministry of Interior Affairs yesterday and issued a circular to ban it in all provinces and cities.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reported that the inland river routes and ships of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, which were previously leased to the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, have been received separately after the expiration of the lease. Zhou Houkun and others, the receiving staff in Zhenjiang and other places, have completed the receiving and returned to the bureau to report. The receiving staff in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other places have not yet returned to Shanghai. However, each line has been operating on schedule without interruption. The bureau has decided to operate five lines on its own and has no plans to expand for the time being. As for the other lines, it is negotiating with merchants to lease them. It has been agreed that the Jinli (Wuxi to Liyang), Hangzhen (Hangzhou to Zhenze), Suqin (Suzhou to Changshu), Sudang (Suzhou to Dangkou), Changqing (Changshu to Qingyang Port), Shenjiao (Shanghai to Chadaijiao), Shenxie (Shanghai to Xieshi), Changli (Changzhou to Liyang), and Changbu (Changzhou to Butou) lines will be leased.

<h3 id="e141">Municipal Citizens Advocate for National Products Association: New Venue to Hold Opening Ceremony; Rescuing Factories, Promoting National Products, Donating Goods to Establish Schools, and Providing Medical Treatment <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Citizens Advocate for National Products Association, since planning and establishing its new venue, has been underway for several months. All the construction work has been designed and executed by Executive Committee Member Mr. Xu Jianruo, and has now been completed. The interior decoration is under active preparation. The opening ceremony will be held on the 15th anniversary of the Association's founding. It is recently learned that the Association's work is progressing rapidly. The following is a record of various news items:</p>
<p>Rescuing Factories</p>
<p>The Association believes that national product factories are in an unfavorable market environment, with goods being difficult to sell and economic turnover severely impacted. Therefore, Executive Committee Member Mr. Chen Yiting was recommended to repeatedly present proposals, visiting Finance Minister Kong, Vice Minister Xu, and leaders in the banking industry, requesting credit loans to be liberally extended to national product factories for rescue. Minister Kong has accepted this proposal and has already issued a notice to the affiliated factories, urging them to fill out the required loan amounts for reporting.</p>
<p>Literacy School</p>
<p>The Association, upon receiving instructions from the Municipal Government, is preparing to establish the Shanghai Private No. 302 Literacy School. Secretary Huang Mengtu has been appointed to be in charge, Clerk Wu Zishi will serve as a teacher, and Clerk Chen Guoming will recruit students. Classes are scheduled to begin on July 1st, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Executive Committee Member Shao Daren will donate textbooks, desks, and chairs, and Xu Yunhui will donate blackboards and other school supplies. Various Executive Committee members will donate student supplies such as pens, ink, stone tablets, paper, and notebooks, enthusiastically supporting the literacy movement, which is commendable. It is reported that, in addition to teaching according to regulations, the school will schedule national product industry leaders to give two lectures each week, supplementing extracurricular knowledge.</p>
<p>Providing Medical Treatment and Medication</p>
<p>As summer approaches, epidemics are rampant, and the common people are unable to afford medical treatment for infections. In order to protect the health of its members and safeguard the well-being of the common people, the Association has hired traditional Chinese medicine doctors specializing in internal medicine, ENT, gynecology, and pediatrics, such as Yuan Rongqing, to provide regular free consultations at the Association from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every afternoon. Medication will be provided free of charge every week, dispensed according to prescriptions by Yu Qing Tang on Avenue Paul Beau. The Association will also collect epidemic prevention and emergency medicines such as Rendan, Shengdan, Ten Drops Water, and Two Days Oil, produced by its member pharmaceutical factories, for daily distribution, benefiting the people and contributing to public health.</p>
<p>Promoting National Products</p>
<p>The Association believes that affiliated factories are affected by the social economy, resulting in sluggish sales and accumulated products. This is of great significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. After repeated emergency meetings, plans for promotion were decided: (1) Collect exquisite products from various factories, set up a room for display, invite representatives of various trade associations in Shanghai to visit and compare, and encourage procurement; (2) Send letters to chambers of commerce across the country, urging stores to promote national products and make efforts to publicize national products; (3) Telegraph the party and government organs of various provinces, cities, and counties, leading the organization of national product exhibitions and instructing the public to use national products exclusively; (4) Petition the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to fix the tariff committee, increasing import tariffs on foreign goods, reducing all taxes on national products, and implementing rewards for national product production.</p>
<h3 id="e142">It Rained Again Yesterday: Rice Prices Plunge by Eighty Cents; Farmers Had Already Sold Their Harvest, Not Affected; With Another Rain, Rice Prices Will Fall Further <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Previously, since the beginning of summer, rainfall has been scarce, and seedlings of rice and cotton have mostly died due to drought, threatening a drought disaster. As a result, rice prices in the city continued to rise, reaching a peak of 13.90 yuan. On the 16th of this month, rice-producing areas in various regions rejoiced in timely rain, and rice prices gradually declined. It is estimated that rice prices fell by one cent on the 16th, four cents on the 17th, and two cents on the 18th. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the China News Agency, rice prices fell another one cent, totaling a drop of eighty cents in four days. According to rice boat owners in Nanshi, the continuous drop in rice prices has not affected the rural economy, as most farmers had already sold their stored rice, benefiting the livelihood of the poor. However, yesterday's market prices were highest for Changshu premium japonica rice at 12.70 yuan, and lowest for Yin rice from various regions at around 10.20 yuan. Furthermore, it rained again yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. The previous rainfall was still insufficient, but yesterday's rain greatly benefited agricultural production, so rice prices are expected to continue to fall.</p>

<p>Previously, a strange man of unknown name and nationality was arrested in this port. The Chinese authorities had repeatedly requested extradition. However, the authorities of the foreign concessions had not agreed because the suspect's name and nationality had not been confirmed. Later, the suspect claimed to be named "Huadeng," a Frenchman, born in a village in France that was destroyed during the European war. The French Consul General in this port, considering the matter bizarre, telegraphed the French government to investigate the truth and provide instructions. Recently, the French Consul General received instructions from the French government, stating that the suspect's claim of French nationality was fabricated. The French Consul General immediately informed the authorities of the Public Concession, stating that "Huadeng" would not be protected. The authorities of the Public Concession, noting that the suspect had been repeatedly requested for extradition by the Chinese authorities and that there was no evidence of his name or nationality, and that he had been detained for a long time, immediately instructed the police to hand over the suspect to the Chinese authorities for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e144">He Ruyan Fined for Assault <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>He Ruyan, a 26-year-old from Hangzhou, resides at No. 7 Yifeng Lane, Caojiadu. He currently serves as a bailiff at the First Special District Court. He married a local woman named Zhu Alian two years ago. Initially, the couple's relationship was good, but soon conflicts arose. Zhu Alian returned to her mother's home, bringing several people with her to her husband's house to reason with him. A conflict broke out at the time. Later, Zhu Alian suddenly requested a wound examination from the local court. Prosecutor Li Fen examined Zhu Alian and found a kick wound on her left knee and ribs. He was subsequently prosecuted in the criminal court. Yesterday, Judge Lu Wuze held a trial. Zhu Alian did not appear. He Ruyan claimed that he did not commit the assault. Shen Xiaoxiang, the lawyer hired by the defendant, rose and argued his case. The judge considered the case concluded and sentenced He Ruyan to a fine of 20 yuan for assault.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Niu Yongjian and Others Develop Seaside Bathing Beach, Discover Ancient Ming Dynasty Well: Located at Qijiadun, 80 Kilometers from Shanghai; Pure Water Still Full at a Depth of Ten Feet <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Riri News reports that Qijiadun, Songjiang County, is located more than 80 kilometers from this port and is situated on the coast, making it a natural seawater bathing beach. A large-scale seaside bathing beach was initiated by Central Committee Member Niu Yongjian and more than ten local gentry, including Zhang Mingguang. Construction began last month, and it was planned to dig several wells near the bathing beach. A few days ago, while several workers were digging, they suddenly discovered an ancient well at a depth of more than ten feet, filled with clear water. According to the speculation of a certain historian, it was likely left over from the late Ming Dynasty, as this area was the region where General Qi Jiguang defended against Japanese pirates during the Ming Dynasty. This has caused a sensation in the surrounding areas, and people have been rushing to the site to visit in recent days. It indeed has value for research by general archaeologists.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Shanghai Telephone Bureau's Recent Business Development Plan <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Due to the increasing number of users and the growing volume of calls, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications needs to develop its engineering business to achieve effective coordination. According to reports:</p>
<p>Increased Relay Lines in Wusong: The bureau considers the Wusong branch to be located north of the city center. The original five pairs of relay lines to the Zhabei branch are gradually becoming insufficient. Currently, two more pairs are being added. For simplicity and economy, it is planned to connect to the city center branch. It is said that from the first of last month, the original Zhabei automatic telephone number 41181 of the branch was changed to the city center number 77181 to facilitate call traffic.</p>
<p>Increased Automatic Switchboard in Longhua: The bureau notes the increasing number of users in the Longhua area. The area is adjacent to the concessions, and there are many factories. The need for telephones is also very urgent. The branch originally had a 150-line automatic switchboard, which has been filled. Therefore, the bureau is planning to add more to facilitate expansion. Once the plan is drafted and approved, procurement and installation can begin.</p>
<p>Planning Multiple-User Line: The bureau plans to modify the existing equipment in the Nanshi and Zhabei bureaus to install multiple-user lines. It is said that this improvement is entirely for the convenience of citizens. For example, three or four households in a residence or farm can share a line, which is economical for both the bureau and users. This method is called a multiple-user line. It is still in the initial stages in China. It is said that it is planned to modify 500 numbers in Nanshi and 200 numbers in Zhabei as a trial. The proposal is currently submitted to the Ministry for approval for implementation.</p>
<p>Publishing New Telephone Directory: The bureau's new telephone directory for this year is about to be printed. It is said that there have been many improvements in this compilation. It is expected to be published around July 1st for distribution to users.</p>
<p>Bureau Employees Transferred to Chengdu to Establish Telephone Service</p>
<p>After Director Xu Xueyu of the bureau successfully prepared the Nanchang, Yichang, and city telephone services one after another, he was recently ordered to prepare the Chengdu city and long-distance telephone lines. At the beginning of this month, Director Xu led the first group of employees and set off for Sichuan. It was ordered that the duties of the director of the bureau would still be temporarily performed by Chief Engineer Yu Bingjian. It is reported that the second group of employees, carrying materials, tools, and vehicles, took a ship to Chongqing yesterday and transferred to Rongcheng. Liu Zenglai, director of the bureau's Document Section, and Wu Xingwu, director of the Recreation Section, are responsible for leading the group. It is expected that they will arrive at the end of the month. The positions left by the employees have been temporarily assigned to other bureau personnel for normal operations.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Xin Hua Bank Robbery Case Trial Record: How Did Zhu Boyan's Gun Fall into the Hands of the Thieves? Bullet Shells Recovered by Police Not Presented Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 4th of this month, at around 10:00 AM, the Xiafei Road Fourth Branch of the Shanghai Xin Hua Trust and Savings Bank at No. 500 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession was suddenly stormed by three armed robbers, who stole 4,766.70 yuan in cash. As the robbers fled with the loot, detectives pursued them. They fled into the Hehe Lane, firing their guns to resist arrest, killing Wang Yan, a Yangzhou woman hired by the Wang family at No. 40 of the lane, and wounding Xue Guoxun, a guard at No. 309 of the lane. They then fled into the Public Concession at No. 67 Chongqing Road, where an unnamed male construction worker was killed by a stray bullet. As a result, the robbers fled into the Ma'an Lane at No. 188 Chongqing Road. The robber Wang Zhiting (also known as Wang Diting, aged 20), a young man from Anhui, was arrested in the kitchen of the Bao family at No. 27 of the lane. A gun and five bullets were found in the woodpile. He was taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detectives from the French police station brought Wang back to the court for interrogation and investigation. The French police later found the gun's serial number. The gun belonged to Zhu Boyan, a native of Haiyan, Zhejiang, who resided at No. 31 Continental Terrace on Rue Albert. It was suspected that Zhu had supplied the thieves with firearms. He was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. He was ordered to pay a 3,000 yuan bail and report when summoned for joint investigation and handling. The case had been reported in this newspaper. The police investigation has now been completed. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Special District Court, accompanied by Clerk Tao Zongkan, came to the Criminal Court to conduct the trial. The ten robbers and Zhu were ordered to be brought to the case. First, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer of the Police Department, stated the case, briefly stating that, according to the police investigation, the first defendant, Wang Zhiting, and his accomplices Zhang Zifa and Chen Zilin, jointly committed the robbery. Wang threatened the bank employees with a gun, Zhang robbed the money, and Chen acted as a lookout at the entrance. After the robbery, they fled with the loot, firing their guns to resist arrest and killing people. Wang was arrested, and the gun was seized. It has been verified that no bullet shells were found, and this gun is not the same. Therefore, the shooting and killing of people are not related to the defendant Wang Zhiting in this case. He is now being prosecuted under Article 348 of the Criminal Law for armed robbery by a group of three people. As for the second defendant, Zhu Boyan, the gun seized was found to be his property. According to Zhu, he gave the gun to a Jin surname friend introduced by a Qiu surname friend from Shanqiu last year. However, the gun was not licensed. He is now being prosecuted under Article 164 of the Criminal Law for disrupting public order and Article 2 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military and Civilian Firearms. The court is requested to interrogate and investigate. The judge then interrogated Wang, who claimed that he came to Shanghai in December last year and met Zhang Zifa at the Xujiahui Weaving Factory. In February this year, he lost his job. He was working at the Sixteen Pups Wharf when Zhang came to call him to chat at the Panjia Wood Bridge Tea House. Later, they went to Avenue Joffre and met Chen. Zhang pushed me in. I didn't dare to jump. I don't know if Chen had a gun. I didn't switch the gun I was holding, and I didn't fire it. At this point, the court summoned the plaintiff Chen Bugao (the director of the Xin Hua branch, a native of Guangdong) to the front of the court to inquire about the robbery. Chen said that when the robbers came in to rob, I was on the phone. The robber stepped forward, snatched the phone from my hand, and threatened me with a gun. Then I saw the robber jump into the counter and search for banknotes. A tall robber was standing at the door. All three robbers were wearing long coats and holding guns. The robber in the case seemed to be the one who jumped into the counter. The judge then summoned Detective Zhou Buguang, who was responsible for handling the case, to describe the arrest of the defendant. Zhou said that Wang escaped from the roof of the kitchen at No. 27, Lane 88, Chongqing Road. Zhang Chen, a tenant in the house, was lying in bed after giving birth. She heard the sound of lead sheets on the roof and called the tenant Shou Qing to go outside to look. Bao then reported to the detectives, who arrested Wang. The judge ordered the bailiffs to take Zhu Boyan to the waiting room behind the court. He separately interrogated the main offender and asked if he knew Zhu and knew where Zhang Zifa's gun came from. Wang said that he did not know Zhu and did not know the source of Zhang's gun. The judge then ordered Zhu Boyan to be brought to the case. Zhu claimed that he was the secretary of the Ming Hua Bank. Although the bank is currently closed for liquidation, he has not left his position. The gun was indeed my property. The gun was given to me by Shi Jinsheng, a friend from the Gold Exchange, seven or eight years ago. Because I was working at the bank, I had a gun for self-defense. Later, a friend gave me a six-inch pistol, which was more beautiful than this gun. I applied for a license from the Public Security Bureau of the Chinese Concession and the British and French Concessions. This gun was kept at home and not used, so I did not get a license. In April last year, a neighbor had Communist hideouts. The French police came to search and found the gun in my house. After investigation, it was proved that I was a legitimate businessman and the gun was returned. Later, Qiu Zipei, the owner of the Xinchang Customs Brokerage on Shandong Road and Jinjiang Street, who was a friend for ten years, introduced me to a friend, Jin Cixiang. This person used to serve as a division commander under He Chengjun, the chairman of Hubei Province. He was doing business in Shanghai. I have known him for three years. Because it was inconvenient to keep the gun at home, I gave the gun to Jin Cixiang. I asked, "Do you know where Jin lives?" He replied, "He used to write me a note with an address: Dachen Gold Shop, Dean Lane, Yipentang Lane." I have never been there and don't know how the gun fell into the hands of the bandits. He also hired a lawyer to defend him in court. At this point, because the police had not submitted the bullet shells found at the scene of the shooting for inspection, the court ordered a postponement until the 28th of this month for further interrogation. The defendant Wang Zhiting was returned to custody. Zhu Boyan remained under the original bail, and Detective Zhou Buguang of the police station was informed to submit the bullet shells found at the next hearing for inspection. The court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Police Suppress Disguised Gambling Devices; Kwong Sang Hong Sued for Disobeying the Law <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In order to cater to the gambling psychology of the general public, businesses such as dance halls, restaurants, and barber shops in this city have installed a novel device resembling a square box with holes on the top and bottom. When someone plays with it, they put a two-cent coin into the top hole and turn the crank. If the coin falls into the winning slot, a token in the shape of a coin will suddenly drop out of the bottom hole. Players can exchange the token for cash. Because this device is not made in China, it does not have a Chinese name. Someone has coined the name "Dui Hua Ji" for it. As the machine becomes popular, it spreads quickly and is adopted by more and more people. Seeing its harm is great, the public security authorities of the public concession, realizing that it is a disguised gambling device, have ordered all police stations to strictly prohibit it in their respective jurisdictions. If found, they will be ordered to dismantle it. Therefore, there are few installers at present, and it is not difficult to eliminate it completely. However, the Kwong Sang Hong branch at No. 156 Henan Road still disregards the ban. Not only does it not dismantle the machine, but it also installs it in a very conspicuous place in the store, attracting customers to enthusiastically gamble. The responsible detectives Su Changsheng and Li Yijian of the police station found that the store owner, Xi Guangsheng, was gambling for profit, violating Article 280 of the Criminal Law and Article 45 of the Municipal Council's police regulations. They reported it to the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng summoned him for trial. The defendant, Xi Guangsheng, refused to appear in court and sent an employee, Tang Miao, to appear. He claimed that Xi had gone to another port and requested a postponement. However, according to the reports of detectives Su and Li, Xi was indeed in Shanghai. Zhang Shuaizhu, the police lawyer, made a statement. The court ordered a postponement of seven days for further interrogation. If Xi Guangsheng still fails to appear in court by the deadline, he will be arrested according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Internal Approval for Red Cross Society to Expand Membership Drive; From August 1st to the End of September; Membership Fees Reduced, Divided into Five Categories <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of its affairs, the China Red Cross Society at No. 9 Jiangxi Road in this port has completed its internal organization over the past few months. In order to expand membership recruitment and develop its affairs, the association has applied to the Ministry of the Interior for approval. Originally scheduled to start recruiting members from July 1st this year, but due to the short preparation time, it was decided to conduct the membership drive from August 1st for two months, ending at the end of September. However, this time the membership fees were reduced uniformly, and an item for sponsorship donation was added. It is learned that the membership fees set by the association are divided into five categories: (1) Honorary Member: 500 yuan; (2) Special Member: 100 yuan; (3) Regular Member: 5 yuan; (4) Ordinary Member: 1 yuan; (5) Youth Member (such as students): 50 cents. In addition to members, a sponsorship donation item is added: a one-time donation of one yuan will be given a membership certificate. It is heard that the association has started preparations yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Preventing Suicide: Director of Social Affairs Continues to Express Opinions; Serious Unemployment Problem Difficult to Solve; Assistance to Be Provided to Those in Need <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Xingya, director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, previously expressed his views on preventing suicide. Since it was published in this newspaper, it has attracted deep attention from all parties. Numerous letters have been sent to Mr. Wu, requesting assistance to avoid suicide. In addition to sending personnel to investigate for disposition, Mr. Wu has supplemented his previous remarks with the following views, which are recorded by a reporter from Shenshi News: Since the various newspapers disclosed my opinion on preventing suicide on the 9th of this month, I have been deeply impressed by the sympathy of public opinion and the generosity of those who have offered advice. For example, the editorial of the Xinwen News advocates cultivating the national perseverance and fundamentally eliminating the thought of suicide in peacetime. The commentary in Shenbao promotes restraining self-centeredness, fostering a national concept, and the highest ideal of benefiting the people, to save the decadent trend of suicide, extending my theory of psychological transformation, with profound implications, are all immutable arguments. As for the section on practical assistance, there are still few insightful views from all parties for reference. Indeed, in the autumn of public and private economic difficulties, the number of people in urgent need of rescue is limitless. Mentioning practical assistance gives the feeling of "How can I get tens of millions of rooms to shelter all the poor scholars in the world!" For example, in this week alone, more than twenty letters have been sent to me, detailing their suffering and requesting assistance, otherwise they will commit suicide. Among them, in addition to a small number due to debts ranging from dozens to hundreds of yuan, requesting to pay on their behalf, the vast majority are due to prolonged unemployment, unable to make a living, requesting to be introduced to a job. At this time, mentioning the issue of unemployment is a truly extremely serious and extremely complex social problem. Suppose the Social Affairs Bureau, to the best of its ability, first registers the unemployed and then introduces them to jobs. If it is to be effective, then all industrial and commercial sectors, all employment agencies, must be willing to cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau and employ its registered people as much as possible, which is one thing. The market is turning prosperous, and various industries do need to add personnel, which is another thing. The people needed by various industries and the people registered by the Social Affairs Bureau must have compatible conditions, which is another thing. The unemployed themselves must not have major defects in terms of physical strength, knowledge, and morality, which is another thing. Therefore, the problems involved in the unemployment issue are so extensive that they cannot be solved by the efforts of one Social Affairs Bureau. Even the authorities in Europe and the United States today are racking their brains and cannot solve it. As for those who suffer from economic oppression, live in poverty, and are not due to their own faults, I am willing to provide assistance to those who have been verified. However, in the current situation, the first thing to do is nothing more than the following points: One is to provide them with funds to send themselves or their entire family back to their place of origin, so as to avoid wandering outside. One is to lend them funds through the Lending Office to enable them to make a living on their own. One is to send their children to childcare institutions for education, to reduce their burden. In short, at a time when the country is in trouble and the people are poor, we can only rely on the general public to have a share of heart, do a share of heart, have a share of strength, and do a share of strength, to prevent suicide and reverse the tragedy. Those who have suffered misfortune should also fundamentally change their minds, strengthen themselves, work hard and strive to overcome the difficulties.</p>

<p>Huang Mingfu, a 39-year-old carpenter from Chongming, came to Shanghai with his wife, Zhou, two years ago because there was no work to be done in the countryside. He lived at No. 37 Sanfu Lane, Xietu Road, South Shanghai, and changed his profession to hawking. Unexpectedly, business was sluggish and he suffered losses. Therefore, since February last year, he has been selling empty soap boxes in various parts of the city, barely making a living.</p>
<p>Making a Bare Living</p>
<p>A few days ago, when Mingfu went to a store in Qinghe Lane near the Ximo Road Small Vegetable Market in the Public Concession to buy empty soap boxes, Ni Weiqing, a Chongming native in the same industry who runs a plank box workshop in Xidelane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, encountered him. Assuming that the soap boxes in the store had been contracted to Ni, he stopped Huang from buying them, resulting in a quarrel. As a result, Huang still managed to get the empty soap boxes. Ni then</p>
<p>Harbored Resentment</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, he gathered several accomplices, hooligans, and invited Huang to the Sanxing Tea Garden in front of Sanfu Lane, Xietu Road, to reason with him. They also went to the Asid Store in Xieqiao Huishang Building for tea, but eventually broke up unhappily. Unexpectedly, Huang Mingfu could not sleep due to the heat in the bedroom at around 3:00 AM yesterday. He spread a straw mat on the cement floor in front of the door to cool off. Ni actually gathered four hooligans, each holding sharp knives, and attempted to assassinate him while Huang was sound asleep. Without asking questions, they stabbed Huang's legs and shoulders randomly, causing extreme pain.</p>
<p>Screaming for Help</p>
<p>His wife, Huang Zhou, heard the commotion and rushed over, seeing her husband bleeding profusely. The murderers had already fled. She reported to Officer Zhang Kuixing at Post No. 23 nearby, requesting the arrest of the murderers and the enforcement of the law. Officer Zhang reported the incident to the patrol officer, who led the police to surround and arrest them. However, it had been a long time, and the murderers had fled without a trace. The injured were then sent to Yiqing Hospital on Liyuan Road for treatment. Doctors at the hospital diagnosed Huang with four cuts on his left leg and three cuts on his left shoulder,</p>
<p>Seven Cuts in Total</p>
<p>Although not very deep, there was a lot of bleeding. It is heard that after receiving the report, Sub-bureau Chief Li has reported the incident to the General Bureau for record and requested a general order to all sub-bureaus and police stations to assist in the arrest of the fleeing murderers and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Jiang Yizheng, a bandit leader from Changzhou, had many followers, and specialized in kidnapping people for ransom in Wujin and other places, committing numerous crimes. It is said that more than 20 people have been killed because they were unable to pay the ransom or the price negotiation failed. Recently, several accomplices were captured by the court there, and they confessed that Jiang Yizheng was actually the bandit leader, with considerable wealth, and remained at large. The court sent detectives to arrest him, but could not find him. The court then sent letters to local authorities to issue arrest warrants. It is now learned that the bandit leader Jiang Yizheng, because the Changzhou local authorities were strictly arresting him, knew that he could not stand firm, and moreover, his followers were scattered except for those arrested. He sneaked into Shanghai last month. Now, Wang Jianqing, a cadre policeman of the local court, discovered the address where the bandit leader was hiding, so he went to arrest him at dawn yesterday morning without making a sound, and immediately escorted him to the court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi interrogated him once and ordered him to be detained, awaiting notification from the Wujin Local Court to send personnel to Shanghai to take custody of him for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yongxing Money Shop was jointly opened by Yu Zhenshu, Chen Jingtao, Chen Dizhou, Chen Zhongchi, Guo Ruoyu, Chen Meibo, etc., with Chen Jingtao as the manager. It suddenly went bankrupt on April 20 this year, owing a large amount of debt, which has not been repaid at all. Creditor Fan Chunlin has filed a lawsuit against Yu et al. through lawyer Chen Tingrui, which has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Shanghai branch of Yujin Bank also had more than 10,000 yuan embezzled. Xu Baolin, the manager of the Shanghai branch, has now specially appointed lawyer Zhang Deqin to sue Chen Jingtao, the manager of Yongxing, and the shareholders Yu Zhendong at the First Special Court, saying that the defendants knew that Yujin Bank had a large capital and instructed their shop to come and solicit deposits, boasting about how substantial their shares were, so they were deceived and successively deposited a current account of 15,672.06 yuan. Unexpectedly, the defendants suddenly went bankrupt after receiving this huge amount of deposits, and although they have repeatedly urged them to liquidate after announcing the liquidation, they have always used the excuse of waiting for the liquidation. It is obvious that they are deliberately shirking responsibility and should be summoned to court as soon as possible and ordered to jointly and severally repay the debt and the delayed interest, and bear the litigation costs, etc. The court has summoned them for clarification and announced the judgment yesterday, ordering Yongxing Money Shop to repay the plaintiff's claim from its joint assets. If there is any insufficiency, the shareholders Yu Zhenshu, Chen Dizhou, Chen Zhongchi, Guo Ruoyu, Chen Meibo, etc. shall be jointly and severally liable for the repayment and bear the litigation costs.</p>

Mr. Li was uninhibited and repeatedly resigned, but the chairman insisted on keeping him. After more than half a year, he resolutely returned east and responded to the ten requests of his countrymen in the capital to exhibit copies of his portraits of famous sages. In a few days, they were all sold out. Chairman Lin of the National Government deeply appreciated it and collected many of them exclusively. After the exhibition, he returned to Shanghai. The collection office accumulated several cases of paper and silk, and he wielded his brush day and night, month after month.

It is said that since the Free New Star Pharmacy became the exclusive agent, in addition to stamping the New Star hard seal on the leaflet in the box, it also includes a voucher for identification and gift.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Reading "A Textual Research on the Deeds of Yang Yao" <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>"The Deeds of Yang Yao" was written by Song Dingfeng, a recluse, and is found in Yue Ke's "Jintuo Zucbian." Mr. Zhu Xizu's annotated and researched edition was recently published by the Commercial Press. In his preface, Mr. Zhu Xizu says: "During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, there were events similar to the present situation. For example, the area north of the Yellow River was lost to the Jin invaders. The Jin also established Liu Yu as the puppet emperor of the Qi dynasty in Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi, with the reign title 'Fuyuan,' which is one similarity. The Song Dynasty, between the Huai and Han Rivers and the Yangtze River, imitated the Tang Dynasty's frontier military governors by setting up more than ten pacification commissioners as a barrier, but they were divided and occupied territory, dividing military strength. Some did not obey orders, attacked and annexed each other, or surrendered to the puppet Qi, borrowing external forces for internal invasion, which is another similarity. Moreover, Zhong Xiang and Yang Yao advocated the doctrine of equalizing wealth and poverty, gathering a crowd of 400,000, spreading across land and water for thousands of miles, which is a third similarity. All of these can serve as a mirror for today." Mr. Zhu Xizu is a thoughtful person. Besides the textual research on the deeds of Yang Yao, he also wants to write a "Veritable Records of the Puppet Qi Dynasty" and a "Study on the Pacification Commissioners of the Early Southern Song Dynasty," hoping to gain insight into the underlying chaos of the time. We believe this is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Zhong Xiang and Yang Yao advocated "equalizing wealth and poverty and equalizing the noble and the base." "Equalizing wealth and poverty" was originally a Confucian idea. Confucius said, "Do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality." Whenever the issue of land distribution is mentioned, no one since Dong Zhongshu and Liu Xin has not dreamed of realizing the well-field system. Even in the early Ming Dynasty, Fang Xiaoru advocated restoring the well-field system, which was used by Prince Yan Di as a slogan to attack Emperor Jianwen. Since the successful implementation of the equal-field system in the Northern Wei Dynasty, discussions about land reform have generally followed this path. The idea of equalizing wealth and poverty is deeply imprinted in everyone's mind. Therefore, those who rose up in the mountains and among the people always carried a touch of "equalizing wealth and poverty," intentionally or unintentionally. For example, Li Zicheng, the roving bandit of the late Ming Dynasty, was universally regarded as a ruthless villain, but his proclamation to attack the Ming Dynasty stated:</p>
<p>"...Now, your Ming Dynasty has long occupied its position, and the laws and regulations have been relaxed. The ruler is not very wise, isolated and often surrounded by deceit. The officials are all self-serving, colluding in factions, and there is very little public loyalty. Bribes run rampant in the government, and the power and blessings of the court are shifting daily. The gentry monopolize profits, and the people's resources are almost exhausted. Heaven has exhausted its love for the people, causing fleeing people to suffer from disasters. I rose from the common people, witnessing the haggard faces and feeling the pain myself. Considering that all the people in the land are suffering from poverty, how can I bear to easily abandon the mountains and rivers, and not relieve them from the fire and water?...”</p>
<p>This proclamation confused many scholar-officials in Beijing at the time, and everyone wrote articles to refute the rumors, saying: "...(The bandit leader) steals the false reputation of benevolence and righteousness and spreads the reality of violence." Zhong Xiang and Yang Yao implemented the equalization of wealth and poverty more purposefully and effectively. They "burned government offices, cities, temples, and the homes of the wealthy, killing officials, Confucian scholars, monks, Taoists, doctors, and shamans." (Mr. Zhu Xizu said: "Burning government offices and killing officials was to eliminate evil laws; burning cities was to eliminate wealthy merchants; burning the homes of the wealthy was to eliminate annexation; killing Confucian scholars was to eliminate arguments about evil laws; burning temples and killing Taoists, shamans, and other idle people was to eliminate religion and those who do not work; only farmers and workers were not killed because they all support themselves by their own labor." This is a very good explanation.) This was more effective in winning people's hearts than Li Zicheng's distribution of the royal treasury to the starving people. They gathered a crowd of 400,000, roaming over a thousand miles. In the early years of the Southern Song Dynasty, the court spent great effort, with famous generals like Yue Fei taking action, and it took more than ten years to quell the rebellion. This was not accidental. The implementation of the equal-field system in the Northern Wei Dynasty and the equalization of wealth and poverty by Yang Yao can be considered the only two practical implementers of the well-field system advocated by Confucianism since ancient times, whether successful or unsuccessful, they are both excellent lessons for studying Chinese social problems.</p>
<p>"The theory of equalizing the noble and the base" also has its origins. Xu Xing of the agricultural school advocated that Yao and Shun should plow and eat with the people. Hui Shi had the idea of abolishing the esteemed. Liezi said that Zichan's older brother Gongsun Chao loved wine, and his younger brother Gongsun Mu loved women, which were even greater than Zichan's governance of the country, all implying the equalization of the noble and the base. Bao Sheng of the Western Jin Dynasty advocated "abolishing the ruler," saying: "Ever since the distinction between noble and base was established, people have created sharp tools, causing endless harm of invasion and cutting. People fear that crossbows are not strong enough, armor is not firm enough, spears are not sharp enough, and shields are not thick enough." He also said: "The ruler worries in shackles, and the people suffer in hardship, precisely because the ruler and ministers are established, and hidden evils grow day by day." "Without ruler and without ministers, there would be no competition or management." He believed that if the ruler was abolished, the noble and the base were removed, then even the likes of Jie and Zhou would be ordinary people, and even if their nature was fierce and extravagant, how could they exercise it?" Zhong Xiang believed that laws that distinguish between noble and base were not good laws, which is what Bao Sheng meant. However, equalizing the noble and the base seems easy, but it is even more difficult to implement than equalizing wealth and poverty. Even Zhong Xiang and Yang Yao, who advocated equalizing the noble and the base, could not help but call themselves Great Sage Heavenly Kings, which is also a great contradiction. Some time ago, I saw Yosuke Tsurumi advocate the naturalization of leadership, saying: "The leadership that we can accept in this era is not the kind of person who leads and governs all things on earth alone. It is clear that there are leaders in hundreds of aspects for specific purposes. In this sense, every modern person has the potential, according to their talents, to be a leader for others... When human civilization reaches its peak, it is extremely natural that all humans become leaders and are led." In that case, the so-called "equalizing the noble and the base" has gained a new interpretation.</p>
<p>The above can only be said to be my thoughts after reading. I would like to write another specialized article on the research aspects.</p>
<h3 id="e173">"Madman" and I <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>The way people greet my friend A Jin with a kind of malice, calling him "madman," often stirs up a violent indignation in my heart. I feel that they are not only insulting A Jin's personality and harming his life, but also, I believe that insulting and harming him is equivalent to insulting and harming his friends. I am one of A Jin's friends. Therefore, I feel the same pain as A Jin for this matter. My brain is about to explode with anger at the way they bully him, abuse him, mock him, and often treat him with such immoral behavior. From this fact, I deeply understand the direction of their inner lives and the source of human misery. I am convinced that this is one of the characteristics of their inherent defects. Whenever I am touched by this matter, I don't know how to depict the outline of life.</p>
<p>A Jin is a person with an unusually straightforward and unyielding personality. He has always worked in the local court. After working hard for most of his life, he is still just a basic messenger. He is almost fifty years old, but his body is still very strong. He not only has the courage to be a person, but also has the talent to be a person. He not only dares to speak, but also dares to resist. Here, he often quarrels with his colleagues for the sake of others. Although he has been here for many years, he has never asked others for a penny of "extra" benefit. If he discovers anything unfair in front of him, such as cheating people, oppressing people, or threatening people, he will roar at you. If he believes that it is necessary to help others, then no matter how difficult it is, he must help them. In short, among them, he is obviously a peculiar person. He has a certain purpose in living here, and he is not afraid to fight with the environment. Therefore, he is very annoying here. They hate him very much because he hinders their various dirty deeds. Therefore, they regard him as a thorn in their side. Must they pull out this "thorn"? Sure enough, he was finally pulled out by them. But he is not afraid, he still has to live on, to do his work, to speak his words. He shouted and yelled everywhere, arguing with people. As a result, he was still hated by them. People looked at him with contempt, and called him "madman" with malice. This matter makes me feel its own nothingness and cruelty, inhuman, full of the smell of wild love from a century ago. I feel very sorry for my friend. And my conscience teaches me that I cannot remain silent about this matter, it is driving me. And my reason is also directing me, so that I cannot but be active in this matter of a lifelong disaster! For my suffering friend, for our unfortunate fate. Therefore, I stood up to speak out against the injustice for my friend, and also to protest for our survival. I explained to people and defended A Jin. I wanted to use my enthusiasm and that undeniable reason to protest to them, so that they would understand that my friend is not the kind of person they call "madman." And I wanted to fiercely spear them, exposing their dark spots. However, my efforts did not have much effect. Not only did they not listen, but they also thought that I was a madman like A Jin. They said: "How can a good person associate with a madman?" So they concluded that I was a madman. As for me, I don't mind being with the "madman" A Jin. And I will fight and sacrifice for him when necessary. So they were even more afraid and disgusted with me. First, they ostracized me from their social life. Then they used various means to frame me, so that I fell into the same situation as A Jin is currently in. In the beginning, I seemed to feel a little pain and sadness in my heart. The reason is that my job was lost because of this, my rice bowl was broken by others, and my "ordinary" friends were also scared of me, they dared not approach me, fearing that my bad reputation would stain their innocence. So they gradually left me and finally broke off all friendly relations with me. This made me very embarrassed at the time. I once said to them angrily: "Why are your brains so stupid? Why are your guts so cowardly? Why are your eyes so short-sighted?" But there was no result. They would not wake up either. Later, I felt that it was useless to have such friends, we do not need such friends. So my heart was also relieved. From then on, I was determined to live the life that I thought I should live. I always maintained that kind of passionate attitude towards pure friendship. And our exchanges became even closer because of this. I often comforted him and helped him within the possible range so that he would not be annoyed by the poor life. And sometimes I explained to him "where" we were encountering. He was very frank and happy, and he shed tears of gratitude for my sincere friendship. This surprised me very much. Because I know that A Jin is a person who only bleeds and does not cry. How could he cry now? Once, when we were sitting face to face talking about various things, especially when I talked about the tragic stories of the world, sure enough, he couldn't bear it. Those precious tears of the old man, those blood-like tears of the old man, quietly fell on the gloomy, dark, and dirty ground. At that time, I felt a kind of unspeakable joy. Because our lives are even more vigorous because of this. I feel that this unbreakable unity of spirit and emotion, besides arousing our enthusiasm for resistance, we feel nothing about their maliciously ridiculing and insulting us.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Thoughts of Being a Father <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Jiu</p>
<p>Coming home, seeing my own children, constantly clinging to my side, crying and making noise, I can't help but think of my own childhood more than ten years ago. Although this cannot serve as a model for my current education of my children, the stern attitude of my father at the time, under the moral authority controlled by purely feudal ideas, is still firmly engraved in my heart, giving rise to a kind of solemn awe.</p>
<p>I entered primary school at the age of six and graduated at the age of eleven. It can be said that I lived a life of cold bench under the strict control of my father. At that time, the only thing that had the deepest relationship with me and helped my father complete his educational responsibility was a ruler that was always placed next to his desk!</p>
<p>Every day when I came home from primary school, when my father called me with his pure voice, the first thing I saw when I stepped into the study that made my heart tremble was that heavy and clumsy ruler! At this time, I didn't dare to be wild at all. I walked tremblingly to the desk where I sat. Then, those "Three Character Classic," "Hundred Family Surnames," "Analects of Confucius," "Mencius," and many other books besides those from school, were opened one by one and taught me to read slowly. After reading them fluently, I would memorize them. If I encountered difficult or unfamiliar places while memorizing, the ruler would immediately hit my body. I endured the pain and wiped away my tears with my sleeves, but I still mumbled and read until I could read them fluently. I was never spared the hope. In addition to reading, I also spent a lonely life alone under a docile and fearful mentality in terms of playing and eating. Even if I ran into another world by chance, but when I met those companions who were as naughty as little sparrows in the fields, if I wasn't ridden as a horse, then my hat would be snatched away and kicked as a ball. This was the beginning of my blushing and feeling the sadness of being trampled on.</p>
<p>But when I got home, thinking of my unfinished homework, my father's terrible face, and that heavy and clumsy ruler, I couldn't help but reappear in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>The scene of my childhood more than ten years ago is still so clearly and closely in my memory, but seeing the children now, their lively playfulness, and the fact that they don't take reading seriously at all, I can't help but feel a little emotional about my own childhood.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Discussion on "Rebirth of Humorous Literature" <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>I don't like to read any articles that are soft. What I love are those articles that describe reality. Correct and powerful inspiration for life must be obtained in such works. However, in a depressed environment under the limitation of objective conditions, it is inevitably subject to its relative decisions, and the emergence of humorous literature also has its social factors.</p>
<p>Regarding humorous literature, I have never advocated special promotion, although humorous literature has the function of revealing the ugliness of reality from the side. Because humor is often misused to the point of being unrecognizable. Mr. Hu Feng has a passage on the view of humor:</p>
<p>"First, if we leave "social concern," whether it is silly laughter, cold laughter, or knowing smiles, it will shift people's attention and become some kind of psychological or physiological pleasure. "Laughing for the sake of laughing" will be regarded by the Saturday School as a promising younger brother. Second, even if it is genuine humor, the territory is very small. People in places where bullets are whistling have no time for humor, people who are displaced in the thousands of miles of red land have no time for humor, and unemployed people walking in the streets and alleys have no time for humor...</p>
<p>I think most people agree with Mr. Hu's views. Humor is a kind of helpless compromise. As a way of writing that has to be done, it is possible." As an author, he grasps a subject matter, and he naturally has many ways to express it. When he has to write a little humorously here, he will never be unwise and directly confront reality. Therefore, in-depth satire, highlighting techniques, and changes in forms become the fashion of the time.</p>
<p>Humor and satire do not have any conflict. On the contrary, humor contains satire, and it does not matter if satire contains a little humor.</p>
<p>I do not object to the existence of humor, but I think it is unnecessary to raise the banner of "humorous literature" to promote it. That is, as Mr. Hu Feng said, even if it is genuine humor, the territory is very small.</p>

<p>— By German Storm, Translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>Something annoying—I don't deny it—is that since I learned to dance, the French tailor has been particularly flattering to me. Whenever he saw me on the street or while walking, he would stop and talk to me loudly for a long time. During the first conversation, he even told me that his grandfather had been the chief stoker in the court of Louis XVI.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Philip," he sighed, while offering me his porcelain snuffbox, "look at how a world declines—but my Nari,—you understand me, Mr. Philip!" He took out a colored checkered handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his little eyes. "There's nothing to be done! I'm a poor man, but that child,—she's my treasure, my sweetheart!" As he spoke, he winked and looked at me with a paternal gaze, as if he wanted to pull me into this declining world too.</p>
<p>Soon, the last dance lesson arrived, and we turned this lesson into a small dance party. Parents were invited to visit our dancing; on my parents' side, only my mother agreed to visit, and my father, as a professional doctor and public doctor of the city, always declined all social invitations. As soon as it got dark, I couldn't wait any longer, and I walked into the hall before the scheduled time; all the candles on the wall lamps and hanging lamps were lit tonight. I closed the door and turned around, only to see Nari standing alone in front of the window with her back to me. The sound of the door closing startled her, and she seemed to be hurriedly taking off a golden ornament from her wrist. When I walked closer to her, I saw that it was a bracelet, and the button was already fastened, but she couldn't open it no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>"Just wear it there, Nari!" I said.</p>
<p>"This isn't mine," she replied a little flustered, "Jenny left it here and forgot to take it back."</p>
<p>The bracelet made of dimly lustrous Venetian gold with exquisite rose flowers shone slightly on that dark, thin wrist.</p>
<p>"Since you've put it on, just leave it on!" I said softly.</p>
<p>Nari shook her head sadly, her fingers touching the button again.</p>
<p>"Come on!" I said, "This won't do; let me help you!" I felt her little wrist resting lightly in my hand. I hesitated for a while, my eyes dizzy.</p>
<p>"Please hurry up!" she asked me. The little girl lowered her eyes and stood in front of me, her face flushed.</p>
<p>The button was finally unbuttoned. Nari silently placed the gold bracelet on the windowsill between the flowerpots.</p>
<p>Soon the hall was full of people. Mrs. Bolica also did not give up this opportunity, at least she participated in her daughter's celebration in the capacity of a servant. She wore a newly starched hat, sometimes carrying a basket of pastries, sometimes holding a tea tray, walking among the guests. Finally, the musicians began to play; today there were four musicians sitting at a table. The old dance master beat the tambourine, and Nari took my hand and danced the mazurka. —Look, how we dance! And how comfortably she is in my arms, carelessly stepping her little feet on the floor! I also danced with her, as if the rhythm of the music was pushing me. I seemed to have a painful feeling because today was our last time, and perhaps there would never be another chance to dance together.</p>

<p>In the first district of Pinghu County, which is the urban area, including both inside and outside the city and the Zhou圩 in the northeast, and the General Riding Pond in the southwest, the jurisdiction is vast. The county, district, and township schools in the area have accumulated arrears of funds, ranging from as much as ten months to as little as seven or eight months. Teachers are struggling to make a living. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, they jointly appealed to the Education Bureau to allocate three months' worth of funds to barely survive. The Education Bureau delayed and did not respond. The day before yesterday, the schools held a joint meeting and, believing that the county government and the County Education Bureau had no sincerity in maintaining the schools, decided to go on strike and issued a declaration. First, it stated that education expenses should not be made difficult when they are not inherently difficult. Second, it criticized the absurdity of levies. Further, it stated the lack of sincerity of the educational authorities. Finally, it asked for the understanding of all elders in the county. On the 19th, a reporter inquired with the Education Bureau, who stated that the Education Bureau had exhausted its efforts and raised 7,800 yuan as a temporary measure. It was tentatively scheduled to issue one and a half months' worth of pay at the end of the month, but the schools could not understand this, so the situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>

<p>The entire student body of the Suzhou Women's Normal School, because the principal, Chen Shu, dismissed teachers Xu Ruodan, Cao Yangwu, Zhu Bingheng, and Zhai Zhenyuan, sent representatives, including Qian Xiuying, to request Principal Chen to continue hiring them next year. Principal Chen evasively refused, so the students were greatly dissatisfied. In the name of the Student Self-Government Association, they issued a declaration expelling the principal. Principal Chen was once surrounded by students, forcing her to write a guarantee to continue hiring the teachers. The atmosphere was very tense. Principal Chen has submitted this matter to the Education Department for review. Director Peng of the Wu County Education Bureau is very concerned about this disturbance and is already conducting an investigation. If necessary, he may mediate.</p>

<p>(Fuzhou, 18th) Fujian Province has decided to enforce literacy as the central task of education. It has issued a special order to all counties that, when preparing the educational budget for the 24th year and allocating community education funds, it has decided that (1) the allocation of community education funds should account for 15% to 20%. Those who have not met the regulations should find ways to make up the difference and must not misappropriate or reduce funds. If the budget does not comply with the regulations, the Education Department will not put it on record; (2) for any new educational expenses, community education expenses should account for 30% to 50%; (3) increased community education funds should be allocated in the ratio of 30% for urban areas and 70% for rural areas.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Jiangsu Gradually Reduces Funding for Studying Abroad; Remaining Funds are Fully Used for Free Education <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang News) The Jiangsu Education Department, having repeatedly received telegrams from the Central Government instructing it to do its best to raise funds from the 24th year onwards to promote compulsory education, should strictly comply. The provincial government committee has already discussed and decided on the funds to be raised by the province for the 24th year. Funds will be allocated separately from the province's special education funds and the province's treasury. Because the province's educational budget for the 24th year has already been established and the use of various expenses has been determined, and new sources of income cannot be raised in a short time, in order to weigh the urgency, it is planned to gradually reduce the funding for studying abroad from the 24th year onwards, and to use all the saved funds for compulsory education. The number that is not enough will be supplemented separately. In recent years, there have been many opportunities for the central government and the Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) organization to select students to study abroad. This province is close to the capital and it is easier to participate. After reducing the funding for studying abroad, there will be no major impact. Therefore, a plan to gradually reduce the funding for studying abroad has been drafted and approved by the 751st meeting of the provincial government. The plan is recorded as follows: (1) No more government-funded students will be selected from the 24th year onwards. Those who have been sent will not have their terms extended after they expire. (2) No more subsidized students will be replaced from the 24th year onwards. The current subsidized students will not have their terms extended after they expire. In the 25th year, separate measures will be formulated to reward and subsidize students who study abroad at their own expense, and an amount of 20,000 yuan will be allocated each year. (3) The measures for selecting current education personnel to study abroad will continue to be implemented as usual. According to the above plan, the estimated amount of tuition fees to be paid each year is as follows: (The current calculation book lists 175,000 yuan) In the 24th year, approximately 50,000 yuan should be paid for government-funded students in Europe and the United States, and approximately 25,000 yuan should be paid for subsidies for Europe, the United States, and Japan. Including the funds for researchers and exchange reserve funds, the total cost is approximately 100,000 yuan. In the 25th year, approximately 40,000 yuan should be paid for government-funded students in Europe and the United States, and approximately 3,000 yuan should be paid for subsidies in Europe and the United States. The funds for rewarding students who study abroad at their own expense is 20,000 yuan. Including the funds for researchers and exchange reserve funds, the total cost is approximately 90,000 yuan. In the 26th year, approximately 10,000 yuan should be paid for government-funded students in Europe and the United States. The funds for rewarding students who study abroad at their own expense is approximately 20,000 yuan. Including the funds for researchers and exchange reserve funds, the total cost is approximately 60,000 yuan. From the 27th year onwards, the annual payment for rewarding self-funded students will be 10,000 yuan, the researcher's expenses and other expenses will be approximately 30,000 yuan, for a total of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 18th to the private Guanghua Medical College of Guangdong. The original order stated, "The Ministry has sent personnel to inspect the college. Based on the submitted report and after review, the main points for improvement are presented as follows: (1) The college's funding relies heavily on student tuition and hospital income. The equipment of various special classrooms and practice rooms is rudimentary. In the future, the board of directors should raise funds to strengthen the equipment. In addition, the college's buildings are insufficient for use, and should be built quickly according to the original plan and completed as soon as possible. (2) The equipment in the various departments and operating rooms of the college's affiliated hospital, except for the ophthalmology department, is also mostly imperfect and too focused on business operations, which hinders students' practice. It almost makes the college an affiliated agency of the hospital. Attention should be paid to correcting this malpractice so that the hospital can be fully used for teaching. (3) Most of the teachers in the college's various departments are local practicing doctors and cannot often be stationed at the school. Clinical assistants, each department has as many as three people, while basic science assistants are still lacking. In the future, responsible professors should be added, full-time teaching positions in clinical departments should be established, and basic science assistants should be placed to improve the educational affairs of each department and to earnestly test and train them to improve the students' height. This order is to be followed and improved and reported." The Ministry of Education also ordered the private Xia Ge Medical College the day before yesterday. The original order stated, "The Ministry has sent personnel to inspect the college. Based on the submitted report and after review, the college should make many improvements. The main points are presented as follows: (1) The college's special classrooms and laboratories, and the equipment of the affiliated hospital (except for the obstetrics and pharmacy departments), are generally lacking and should be strengthened immediately to meet the needs of practice and research. (2) The level of students and general subjects is too low. In the future, strict attention should be paid to recruiting new students and training them to improve the level of basic subjects. In addition, foreign teachers lecture in Cantonese, which fails to fully express the theory and needs to be improved. (3) The subjects set up by the college are biased towards the obstetrics and gynecology department. The affiliated hospital restricts the admission of male patients, so students are not given sufficient opportunities for practice. In the future, methods should be found to correct this to facilitate students' practice. (4) There are many staff members in the college. Efforts should be made to reduce them in order to provide the remaining funds for equipment or other beneficial uses. This order is to be followed and improved and reported."</p>

<p>Yesterday's market situation was characterized by tight capital due to the incomplete review of loan procedures, preventing the implementation of lending.  Consequently, the market atmosphere remained firm, showing no signs of decline. Both morning and afternoon interbank lending rates stayed at 0.20, and call money rates also remained at 0.70, the same as the previous market.

<p>Yesterday, the trend on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was quite bullish at first, with all bonds rising sharply. However, due to the market's inherent weakness, the market fell back again. The rally proved unsustainable, as expected by reporters. Trading volume this month has already been minimal. It is rumored that financial institutions have delivered a large amount of physical commodities, which will further impact margin positions. Yesterday's activity was characterized by the most vigorous gains during the morning opening, with each bond rising by about one yuan after the absorption of the 54, 35, and 78 series. The front series continued to rise in the second round. However, large investors took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the rally to falter and the market price to fall by about 0.3 yuan. The opening of the afternoon market saw even more sellers, and the absorption power of retail investors was weak, causing the market price to fall by another 0.3 or 0.4 yuan. The market closed with a stalemate between bulls and bears, waiting for the development of news. Trading volume slowed down, and fluctuations became minimal. Overall, the market price results for the entire day showed that most bonds returned to gains ranging from 0.3 or 0.5 yuan to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. The total transaction volume was 19,942,000 yuan.

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The situation remained balanced. This was due to the difficult economic situation, which made all businesses feel depressed, commodity prices trended downwards, and foreign merchants exerted heavy pressure. However, after days of frantic declines, the market should have a rebound. A portion of the market that had already bottomed out saw those pushing up to make a profit become active. However, foreign merchants sold at every high price.</p>
<p>Yarn Futures Firm After Covering Shorts</p>
<p>The yarn futures market opened firmer in the morning due to short covering by those profiting after the previous day's large decline. Prices rose across all months.

<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell. A portion of cotton merchants in the market pushed up and looked higher, and they held on tightly in the near months. However, given the heavy cotton inventory, it was very difficult to trend upwards. The American cotton situation was also flat and uneventful.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Fall After Initial Rise</p>
<p>The cotton futures market opened in the morning, with American cotton falling by 10 points and Indian cotton remaining flat. Market conditions in all months saw a sudden rebound after the previous day's large decline, and a portion of cotton merchants turned from short to long. Bullish traders frantically pushed up prices at the close. As a result, all months rose by 0.4 to 0.45 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and new cotton rose by 0.2 jiao. The market opened in the afternoon, and the market weakened as a certain merchant sold, the number of factories suspending work increased daily, and the demand for spot cotton was sluggish. A major player sold new cotton. As a result, old cotton fell by 0.15 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and distant months fell by 0.2 to 0.3 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. Prices rose by 2 to 5 points in all months as Liverpool traders bought July contracts due to rain in Texas. Trading among dealers was brisk. Later, it was reported that the weather forecast for the western region was turning sunny, but there were still showers in the southernmost part of Texas. Bullish traders liquidated positions, and New Orleans sold off, causing market prices to fall back. Industry peers were largely awaiting developments in Washington. The market closed flat and weak. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 7 to 9 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 7 points, and futures rose by 12 points. There was slight bullish liquidation in Indian cotton. As a result, Pingguo'er remained unchanged, Oumula rose by 0.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 18th).</p>

<p>The flour market saw prices for foreign wheat rise, with Chicago up by about 3, 4, or 5 jiao and Canada up by 6 or 7 jiao. Furthermore, both industry insiders and outsiders saw prices holding firm. Opening prices for all months were up by about 1 fen from the previous day. However, after the second round, market sentiment gradually weakened, as retail bulls gradually liquidated positions and new buyers did not emerge. The market atmosphere weakened accordingly. When the market opened in the afternoon, the cloudy weather and cooling temperatures led to expectations of continued rain, and market sentiment turned bearish. Opening prices immediately fell by 1 or 2 fen. Subsequent trading was not active, and both sides largely watched and waited. The market appeared to stagnate. Observing subsequent developments, it may be difficult to see a bullish market due to the tight money supply. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, July and August fell by 2 fen, and September and October fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li.</p>
<p>When the wheat market opened, market sentiment was stable, similar to the previous day. Later, the selling of wheat by domestic groups and the liquidation of positions by bulls led to a gradual weakening of the market atmosphere. When the market opened in the afternoon, the lack of activity in the flour market further softened sentiment. Outside buyers largely watched and waited, as the tight money supply made it difficult to stimulate buying by both industry insiders and outsiders. As a result, prices for July through October fell by 4 fen compared to the previous day. The spot wheat market remained stable, as most of the incoming goods were handled by consignment merchants who were unwilling to sell below cost. Although this year's factory demand was not as greedy as in previous years, market sentiment was still stable. Open prices: Kai Ming Guang wheat at 3.45 yuan, Zhang Bailing wheat at 3.445 yuan, Ba Cheng wheat at 3.1 yuan, Wu Yi wheat at 3.42 yuan, Da Ju wheat at 3.4 yuan, Danyang wheat at 3.37 yuan, Huzhou wheat at 3.323 yuan, Jiang Xin Zhou wheat at 3.378 yuan, Kunshan wheat at 3.4 yuan, second grade 3.6 fen, Taicang wheat at 3.36 yuan, second grade 3 fen, Penglai wheat at 3.323 yuan. Fuxin sold 6,500 bags, Fufeng sold 3,000 bags, and Shenda and Xinda each sold 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday's local rice sources from the Shanghai South gangs only had ten-odd sources (a total of 4,000-odd piculs of goods), and the slightly stabilized weather and atmosphere made the sales market more active. The market prices for the various types of rice, such as the Su Tong Jing, Nan Gang early rice, and Qing Jiao Song Si Xi Lian late rice, were all stable. Yesterday, there were very few boats arriving at the He Xia roads in Shanghai North, only six or seven. The market for various goods remained slow, and prices did not fluctuate much. The price of thin rice showed a slight downward trend, the price of early rice was close to the angle, and the prices of all other goods were stable.</p>
<p>The transaction volume of foreign rice yesterday was light, with the morning market still in a flat position. In the afternoon, due to the cloudy and rainy weather, the panic in the inland areas had disappeared, and it was rumored in the market that the domestic production price was low, and there was a new transaction of 20,000 tons. The price of each foreign rice fell by about 0.1 jiao. A total of 4,000 bags of Saigon rice and 2,000 bags of small-grain Siamese rice were opened, and more than 400 sentences of Hunan Shashi rice were also opened. However, the market inventory was insufficient, and the market price could still stand firmly.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Soybean Prices Fall Below the Three Yuan Mark <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market situation was that Japanese foreign firms were peddling Sipingjie futures soybeans in the market, with the delivery price for the first half of July being only 3.34 yuan. As a result, 78 vehicles were traded, and the market continued to soften and the public was even more fatigued. The market fell below the three yuan mark as soybeans by vehicle were being brought in. The day before, the Dade Xin Oil Factory brought in a vehicle of Tai'erzhuang beans, a vehicle of Zhengyangguan beans, and a vehicle of Yingzhou beans, all at a price of 2.95 yuan. Yesterday, the market fell another 5 or 6 fen, with a vehicle of Quanhe beans being traded at 3.1 yuan, three vehicles of Yingzhou beans being traded at 3.05 yuan and 2.9 yuan. Spot sales of Sipingjie spot soybeans in the local market totaled two vehicles, priced at 3.44-3.43 yuan, Fanjiatun soybeans at 3.62 yuan for 200 bags, Xicheng soybeans at 3.52 yuan for 100 bags, and Andong soybeans at 3.68 yuan for 200 bags. Future market conditions will be affected by the conditions of the beans in the Eastern Provinces, and it is feared that the market will not be good.</p>

<p>The recent Xiamen candied tangerines have been affected by the low-priced local factory-made cakes produced in Wenzhou. Therefore, except for a few that have been reduced by about 1 yuan, the rest are temporarily short of receivers. There are even fewer outlets for old goods. It is estimated that the market will have to wait until the Northern gang needs it in the middle of next month before it can continue to be opened.</p>

<p>There were still few transactions in the sugar market yesterday. The guild's quoted price for 24-grade raw sugar white spot was 16 yuan, and the price for re-exported goods was 5.1 yuan, but no transaction was made. The price of the sugar from our own warehouse was still 16.05 yuan, with dozens of bags being traded. There was no change in Taikoo sugar and our own factory's refined white sugar, and there were not many receivers. Since the rise in the Shantou exchange rate, not much domestically produced Chao Qing has been opened in the Shanghai market. There were a few transactions among the stores yesterday, with 85 bags of ordinary Huanggang Qing sugar being opened at a price of 9.85 yuan. Xinghua secondary white and Xing Chi sugar were not opened due to the difference in the negotiated prices, with the difference between the two parties being in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.</p>

<p>Hongjiang Tung oil sales are currently in full swing, but because there are no foreign buyers, price increases and decreases are slow and not drastic. The market is rarely noticed because price fluctuations do not exceed one yuan during the peak sales season in the spring and summer of previous years. Furthermore, the total number of barrels produced by each oil mill in the producing area each year is always over 100,000. Relying entirely on the domestic sales market, the market is often tired for a long time but briefly bullish. However, last year, each oil mill reduced its production in light of excessive inventory. Only 40,000 to 50,000 barrels were produced. By the spring of this year, it was felt that there was not enough to meet sales demand. The shortage of goods became even more serious after the summer, and prices gradually soared. At the beginning of spring, each barrel of vice Hong was only 22 yuan, but by late spring, it had risen to between 25.4 and 25.6 yuan. Recently, as there are fewer goods, the price has become more bullish. The Zhenjiang store opened a public market the day before, with Vice Hong Yang Heng Yuan Qing Yuan Feng two brands requiring 26.2 yuan for Shanghai delivery. Therefore, the store in this port has already sold 26.4 yuan. There is still the Liu Tongqing brand, which used to be reduced by 0.6 yuan, but this year it has increased by 0.2 yuan because the number of productions is the lowest. It needs to be sold for 26.6 yuan. There are also various brands that need to be sold for 25.8 yuan. As for Zheng Hong, such as Jichang and He, the selling price is also the highest because the goods are the best. It is heard that the Zhenxing public market has already sold 31 yuan per barrel, so the Shanghai market will not sell below 31.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas telegram for white lead skin required 21 pounds per ton, which was 1 pound and 10 shillings better than the price last week. The same industry in this port did not interfere, so the foreign companies did not make any transactions.

<h3 id="e224">My "National Goods Year" and the Students <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zhaowen</p>
<p>I am a student, and moreover, I am a university student. Of course, I have some connection to the "National Goods Year" for students. However, I insist that I have no connection to the "National Goods Year." What is the reason? Because whether it was before the "National Goods Year" was established or after it was established, whether it was purchasing items or buying clothes, my consistent advocacy and plan to buy and use national goods has never changed. Before this year, I advocated using national goods as much as possible. This year, I still advocate using national goods as much as possible. I had never shouted high-sounding slogans before, and I have not participated in any so-called national goods movements up to this day.</p>
<p>I have never blindly believed in foreign goods, let alone secretly buying or using foreign goods in large quantities. As far as national goods are concerned, I believe that I am ahead of the times, because I have been implementing the work of the so-called "National Goods Year" for students since I was a child. When I entered the first year of university three years ago, I said to my classmates: "I will never wear a Western suit until three days before I go abroad." Although national goods can also be used to make Western suits, they are still rare at the moment.</p>
<p>The work of the "National Goods Year" for students was indeed tense for some time not long ago. The promotion association has also been opened, and earnest speeches and lengthy works of thousands of words are easy to see in newspapers and magazines. However, I dare not believe that the gentlemen who write articles and give speeches are all practitioners who use national goods. Even among the Shanghai students who took a car to the municipal government to take the oath last time, I am afraid that at least a few people wearing foreign Western suits can be found.</p>
<p>Can a movement succeed simply by shouting slogans and giving lectures on reasoning? No! What promotes its success is still the spirit of "hard work". During the "National Goods Year" for students, I hope that students across the country will start from themselves and use national goods and wear national goods. Furthermore, I hope that students across the country will not only use national goods and wear national goods during this year's "National Goods Year" for students, but also regard this year's "National Goods Year" as the meaning of starting to use national goods from this year, and continue to use them forever in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e225">From Inventing National Goods to the Need for Talent <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a gratifying invention in the national goods industry, that is, Mr. Tianxu Wosheng's self-made pen nib has been successfully announced. After reading the news that the Invincible Pen is about to be launched, we cannot help but admire Mr. Chen, who is striving for national goods. I believe that our national goods industry is hoping for many talents like Mr. Tianxu Wosheng to invent the work of "Heaven Does Not Deceive Me".</p>
<p>Originally, the Chinese seem to be the most fond of imitating. Seeing that a certain industry can be done, you also imitate it, and I also learn from it. As a result, it is crudely made, and the work is reduced, and the things that can be done become impossible to do. In the past, Zhang Xiaoquan's shear shop in Hangzhou was very famous. Not long after, you also called Zhang Xiaoquan, and I also called Zhang Xiaoquan, as if every shear shop had to be called Zhang Xiaoquan to open. It is still the same now. A new Bakelite factory has been established, and after a while, dozens of Bakelite factories have been opened. Of course, everyone thinks that this industry can be done, and everyone is not good at doing this thing. Our national goods industry is often wandering in the diverging road of "imitation" and cannot find the path of creation. This is very worrying!</p>
<p>Let me talk about the importance of inventing national goods again. Many people who love to use national goods are very saddened by the incompleteness of national goods, so they have to use foreign products as substitutes. If there are talents who slowly create the utensils that are not available in the goods and contribute them to the society, I think it will be somewhat beneficial than everyone drilling into an industry and you squeezing me! Moreover, on the one hand, it can prevent the import of foreign goods and make the enemies of national goods be cleared!</p>
<p>However, in fact, there may be many difficulties.</p>
<p>A Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e226">Student Activities During Summer Vacation <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Summer vacation is approaching. Students of all levels will suspend their studies and return home to spend the summer. I believe that self-respecting students will not let these two months pass in vain. Since this year is the "Student National Products Year," the best approach is to strive to promote the use of domestic goods. How can we do this?</p>
<p>(1) Do our best in our hometowns to promote the benefits of using domestic goods and persuade family members and friends to use domestic goods exclusively.</p>
<p>(2) Investigate the comparison between the sales of domestic and foreign goods in our hometowns. It is best to compile statistics using numerical data to warn the public.</p>
<p>(3) Collect various samples of domestic goods and hold mobile national products exhibitions.</p>
<p>(4) Visit various shops and persuade shop owners to sell domestic goods exclusively.</p>
<p>(5) Hold open-air lectures in the evenings or during the leisure time of villagers to persuade them not to use foreign goods under any circumstances.</p>
<p>(6) Establish a "National Goods Consumption Association" with a fixed charter and solicit local people to join in order to promote the cause.</p>
<p>My respectable and lovable students, this kind of work is most worthwhile and the most valuable way to save the country. Let us all work hard to do it!</p>
<p>Firstly, I am afraid that factories do not have enough capital to fund experimental inventions. Secondly, I am afraid that even if inventions are made, there will be no market for them. Regarding the first point, I hope that the government authorities will cooperate with ambitious domestic goods manufacturers to recruit creative talents on a large scale. Regarding the second point, I implore enlightened customers to abandon their bad habit of buying foreign goods and jointly support the new domestic industry. If my words can serve as a starting point for something greater, that is my hope!</p>
<h3 id="e227">Alas! Eating Foreign Rice! <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>I recently read a news report about our hometown—Wuxi—that truly broke my heart! What was it? It turned out that the rice purchased by the Disaster Relief Committee was entirely foreign rice (Saigon). The checks issued included 5,000 yuan from the Bank of China and 5,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank. Tax-exempt relief rice, already purchased from Shanghai, totaled 6,000 shi (about 600 metric tons) of No. 2 Saigon rice, with each shi costing approximately seven yuan (calculating each shi at seven yuan, 42,000 silver dollars flowed to foreign countries!). Thirdly, more than 30,000 people, large and small, in the 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th rural districts were receiving relief due to the drought! Will this relief be sustainable? Will they eat it with peace of mind? I believe this is not a fundamental solution! My old friend, Brother Chusheng, in his commentary in the "Fourth Money Industry Monthly Report" on "Funds Will Be Exhausted by Sitting and Eating," stated, "The outflow of funds continues unabated, and in fact, it is being exported in large quantities. For example, in the case of foreign rice, the imports for two months this year totaled 10,517,783 yuan in national currency. Other goods are not included. These ten million yuan are entirely used to buy rice, and rice is food. Once eaten, it is completely gone! ... If eating it leads to some production, it would not be a waste. Unfortunately, the farmers who have suffered from drought are fleeing to other places, seeking only to be fed and doing nothing... Our country's funds are limited. How can we withstand this waste! As the saying goes, 'Sitting and eating empties the mountain' and 'Eating everything until it's gone!' In the past, this was used to criticize a family or an individual, but now it can be used to criticize the entire society," which is extremely alarming!</p>
<p>My opinion is that we should lend the tens of thousands of yuan in disaster relief funds (silver) to the victims or distribute seeds, and vigorously promote side occupations such as rabbit breeding... (as advocated by my friend Mr. Xue Mingjian, general manager of the Shenxin No. 3 Factory). We should not foster the mentality of sitting and eating relief rice. Even if we purchase, we can use Chinese flour instead. Why must we use foreign rice and send large amounts of silver to foreigners?</p>
<p>Alas! In this booming "Student National Products Year," we are still relying on foreigners for a large amount of what we eat. How can we justify this?</p>
<h3 id="e228">Good News in the Student National Products Year <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Dear students: Isn't this year the "Student National Products Year" as defined by various groups? Although the call to promote domestic goods is still very enthusiastic during the "Student National Products Year," the import of foreign goods is still very fierce and frightening? We can easily understand this if we pay a little attention to the statistics in the newspapers. This situation fills us with endless indignation and heartache!</p>
<p>But, friends, don't be sad. Let me tell you some good news! These are indeed good phenomena and good news in the Student National Products Year, worthy of our joy and congratulations. That is, the industrialist Mr. Tian Xuwo Sheng has invented the domestic steel nib, the domestic economical pen, and Mr. Lin Lubin has invented the domestic eraser, all of which have succeeded one after another. Aren't these some noteworthy good news? Now, I will briefly introduce the three new inventions below, hoping everyone will pay attention.</p>
<p>(1) Domestic Steel Nib</p>
<p>This domestic steel nib was invented by Mr. Tian Xuwo Sheng. Seeing the large sales of foreign steel nibs in Chinese student circles, he resolved to research and invent domestic steel nibs to resist them. After much research and improvement, he has finally succeeded. This pen is G-shaped. In the future, he will also make it in the Polo style. It can also be written on Chinese paper without bleeding. He is actively manufacturing it. Once 100,000 pieces are made, he will announce the launch in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(2) Invincible Economical Pen</p>
<p>This invincible economical pen was also jointly researched and invented by Mr. Tian Xuwo Sheng and Mr. Lin Lubin. The form of the pen is no different from the fountain pens sold on the market, but the nib, pen barrel, and rubber tube are entirely made of domestic raw materials. Its selling price is only about one or two dimes, which is several times less than a fountain pen. It is also being actively manufactured. Once it is made, it will be sold by the Home Industry Society, and students can each have one without paying a huge price to buy foreign fountain pens. Isn't this also a gratifying good news?</p>
<p>(3) Domestic Eraser</p>
<p>Erasers have always been exclusively foreign products. In order to regain rights and interests, Mr. Lin Lubin resolved to create a domestic eraser to meet the needs of all sectors. After much research, he now has a very good product. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has issued a notice to all schools to purchase it. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's National Goods Chamber of Commerce has also conducted a thorough review and confirmed that it is entirely a domestic product.</p>
<p>Aren't these three things good news in the Student National Products Year? I sincerely hope that you, dear students, will never buy foreign goods if domestic goods are available from now on. This is how you can be worthy of the hard work of the inventors, and it is also the duty and responsibility of students.</p>
<h3 id="e229">New Inventions in the National Goods Industry <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sun</p>
<p>——Mr. Hua’s All-Line China Serge——</p>
<p>Speaking of Nanjing's black satin, people probably know that it was once used as tribute and enjoyed great fame. Therefore, the words "black satin" have left a deep impression on people's minds. During its heyday, the number of workers who depended on it for a living reached more than 200,000; the annual sales were no less than ten million yuan. Its prosperity can be imagined. But unfortunately, since the import of serge and valencia directly from overseas, black satin has suffered a great blow, and now it has fallen into decline. The number of unemployed workers is more than 100,000. This is so unfortunate!</p>
<p>Hua Yutian and his son, who run the Yunchang Weaving Factory at No. 11 Fengyou Temple in Nanjing, are also outstanding talents in the satin industry. Since Nanjing black satin was defeated by imported serge, he has been engaged in the research of weaving serge. After three long years and dozens of failures, he finally succeeded. Now, he has named this serge "All-Line China Serge." It has several advantages: first, the material is smooth and does not attract dust; second, it is durable and does not develop mold spots; third, the material is tough and will not break, and because of its toughness, it is durable; fourth, the price is low. The price of this serge is half the price of imported serge, making it most suitable for making robes, jackets, and shoe materials. Two types have already been woven: one is 2.5 feet wide and 2.5 zhang (about 8.3 meters) long, specifically for making jackets and robes; the other is 5 inches wide, specifically for making shoe materials, with each roll enough to make five pairs of shoes. Hua Yutian and his son have specially contracted with more than a dozen well-known shoe stores in Nanjing, including Lianshengcheng on Sanshan Street, Sanji on Sanshan Street, Sanju on Fudong Street, and Huashengdun on Huapailou, to use China serge as shoe material. He has also applied to the Ministry of Industry for a patent. Hua Yutian and his son also plan to continue researching and weaving All-Line China Serge in various colors. Regarding the research and invention process, according to Hua Yutian and his son, it began in May of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). First, the serge was disassembled to explore its raw materials and weaving method, and then manufacturing began. However, the woven fabric was not only rougher in texture but also less durable. There were dozens of failures and more than a dozen changes. The changes can be roughly divided into three parts. The first step was to weave silk warp with thread, but the result was that the texture was fine like satin, but not strong. The second step was to use silk as the warp and thread as the weft, but the result was that the texture was too rough. The third step was to weave entirely with silk, which finally resulted in this All-Line China Serge. In total, 70 to 80 bolts of serge were woven since the beginning of the research, and about half of them were not suitable, resulting in a loss of more than a thousand yuan. As for the mental losses, they are simply impossible to calculate.</p>
<p>It is said that the import volume of serge reaches millions of yuan annually. Now that Hua Yutian and his son have invented All-Line China Serge, which is of excellent quality and low price, it can certainly defeat imported serge. This can truly be said to be good news in the Student National Goods Year and is worthy of our solemn introduction!</p>
<h3 id="e230">Attention, Female Students <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Fu</p>
<p>The blue cloth that female students wear for their cheongsams (qipao), "Loving-Loving Blue Cloth" (also known as "Modern Blue Cloth"), is generally mistakenly believed to be a domestic product, but its origins are unknown, and the outflow of money is considerable, which is very painful. Now I will briefly describe a thing or two to inform my compatriots. According to the "Loving-Loving Blue Cloth" sold on the market, part of it is Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth produced by a certain foreign company, and most of it is produced by a certain Chinese factory or dyeing factory. There are many brands of blue cloth that falsely claim to be domestic products. Some unscrupulous merchants profit from this by rebranding this kind of blue cloth, or first buying white cloth, dyeing it, and then selling it on the market as entirely domestic products. Its original base cloth is all inferior. If you want to buy genuine domestic products, there are very few. Those who generally buy it fall into the trap. This year is the Student National Goods Year, and I see that female students are all wearing this blue uniform, advising people not to buy foreign goods, but I am afraid that foreigners will laugh their heads off. Here, I recall that the South City Ten Cloth Stores once held a seven-cloth exhibition last year, collecting various kinds of coarse cloth spun and woven by farmers in rural areas, and the products were not bad. A certain female school in South City adopted it as a school uniform, which was quite elegant and admirable, and had the spirit of Gandhi. Many women at home also followed suit. This year, there has been a complete change, and foreign goods have been adopted uniformly, probably because they do not know the inside story and have fallen victim to unscrupulous merchants! (Thank you)</p>
<h3 id="e231">Introduction to Domestic Refined Starch Powder <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Xue Mingjian, general manager of the Shenxin No. 3 Factory in Wuxi, is very enthusiastic about researching domestic industrial arts. Recently, he has also spared no effort in advocating rabbit breeding as a substitute for silkworms! In addition, Yunli Chemical Industrial Company produces a kind of refined starch powder with the "Red Heart" brand. In view of the urgent need to popularize domestic goods, I am happy to introduce it as follows:</p>
<p>Company Introduction: The "Red Heart" brand refined starch powder produced by our company is carefully researched and developed by chemical experts and textile engineers. When used for sizing yarn, it can make the color shiny and increase the tensile strength. When used for sizing cloth, it can avoid the drawback of flooding the cloth surface and can eliminate the need to add butter. Not only can the labor of workers be reduced, but also the cost can be reduced, which is truly good news for domestic factories.</p>
<p>Advantages: Generally, (1) If refined starch powder is not used in the sizing tank, 50 pounds of butter (or up to 80 pounds) must be used. Calculating butter at 18 cents per catty, 4 to 5 yuan can be saved per tank. (2) When refined sizing powder is mixed with butter in the sizing tank, the water must reach a temperature of 70 to 80 degrees before it can be mixed in. If it is put in too early, it may be difficult to mix evenly. If it is put in too late, the sizing power is weak. If this powder is used, it can be mixed in with the sizing and mixed evenly with cold water. Then, the water can be turned on, and it can be used as soon as the water is hot. There is no need to worry about putting it in too early or too late. (3) This powder is completely soluble in water, which can enhance the tensile strength and lubricity of the yarn when dry. It is not only easy to use in the dyeing process, but also saves materials and time!</p>

<p>— (Lean Scholar)</p>
<p>During the plum rain season, it rains every day and it is also humid, making people feel almost as if they are living in a deep jar. Isn't that suffocating? In the past, people said, "During the plum rain season, it rains in every house, and there are frogs everywhere in the green grass ponds." These two lines of poetry really contain some meaning, because this kind of weather is indeed closely related to farming in our southern regions.</p>
<p>This year, it has been a long time since it rained after summer began. The villagers planted cotton in soil that was like incense ash. How can you expect it to sprout tender leaves? Even if there is a heavy rain soon, it is already too late to replant. People who do not till the land but eat in the cities and metropolises do not know that a famine is coming again.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "If the summer solstice doesn't come, the water coffin won't open, and cotton will really not grow. Don't even think about planting rice. In our Jiading, it is still 70% cotton and 30% rice," meaning that more people plant cotton and fewer people plant rice. If there is a small harvest, how can we hope for a big harvest? Alas! Human disasters cannot be eliminated. A glimmer of hope originally relied on God's blessings. If the heavens are unwilling to protect us common people, then, I ask, where is the savior!</p>
<h3 id="e233">Hunger <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Shanglong</p>
<p>Hunger, the fire of hunger, must be something that everyone fears!</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar of the Song Dynasty said, "Starving to death is a small matter, losing virtue is a big matter." This statement sounds very grand, but it has taken the lives of many people in history. When I was young, I heard my father say that my aunt was a follower of this saying. After my uncle died, she really fasted to avoid losing her virtue, and in just five days, she followed her husband to the underworld!</p>
<p>According to legend, the brothers Bo Yi and Shu Qi fled to Shouyang Mountain to eat ferns because they were ashamed to eat the millet of Zhou. Later, they realized that ferns also belonged to the Zhou family, so they simply stopped eating and starved to death on Shouyang Mountain. I think these two unfortunate brothers were too foolish. Grain and ferns are both born of nature. What does it matter if they belong to the Zhou family or not? Oh! Cursed "Starving to death is a small matter, losing virtue is a big matter!"</p>
<p>Gandhi, the proponent of non-resistance in India, was adept at fasting. This can be seen from the fact that he has fasted many times without starving to death. So, hunger is also an art, with high and low levels. I also thought that Gandhi's fasts were just a form of civil resistance. He hoped to use fasting to move his masters or aristocratic lords. In my opinion, this is slightly more intelligent than the Yi Qi brothers!</p>
<p>Hunger has a long history in China. "Starving corpses line the road" and "Great famine" are indispensable embellishments in the historical books of past dynasties. This cursed hunger is now raging like a wildfire, swallowing countless useful men, women, old, and young.</p>
<h3 id="e234">In the Loquat Orchard <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>When the loquats turn yellow, everyone is busy building sheds to watch over them, fearing that they will be stolen or eaten by squirrels and birds. As usual, the pine wood frame that we have erected next to the hall is also removed and moved to the loquat orchard.</p>
<p>The top is covered with reed mats, and the surroundings are covered with reed curtains. Inside, there is a plank, and that patched-up mosquito net is hung, like a small house. The person living inside is safe from the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Day and night, the loquat orchard is lively enough. The sound of oil drums and bamboo clappers resounds in each garden. The birds living in nature are frightened and hide somewhere.</p>
<p>The children are allowed to watch over the shed during the day. At night, I sleep in the shed with my older brother to watch over it, along with that yellow dog.</p>
<p>When we are eating dinner, the yellow dog, who has not been fed, often comes to our feet. His mind knows that food must be taken to the loquat orchard to be eaten. He stares with his eyes, as if urging us to go to the loquat orchard quickly.</p>
<p>My older brother carries the quilt on his shoulder, I light the lantern, and carry the yellow dog's food to the loquat orchard. The yellow dog walks "tat-tat" in front.</p>
<p>The lantern is hung on the eaves of the shed, we arrange the quilt to sleep, the yellow dog eats his fill, licks his lips, and sleeps in front of the shed with his tail tucked in. Gradually, the candle in the lantern burns out, my older brother smokes enough water pipe tobacco before silently falling asleep, and in the quiet garden, one can faintly hear the sound of people knocking on the bamboo clappers in the distance.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Two Sisters <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Although Hu Shansun was not a millionaire, he owned two ancestral stores that were forty or fifty years old, with an annual income of about five or six thousand, so his life was very comfortable.</p>
<p>Although his eldest son was already married and had children, he was still lecherous. Although his wife guarded him like a thief, he would do things like stealing chickens and dogs whenever he had the opportunity.</p>
<p>Three years ago, his hometown was hit by a flood, and poor families sold their sons and daughters in pain. So, Hu Shansun's wife spent 180 yuan, entrusting someone to buy two maids from the countryside. The two maids were sisters. The older one was fifteen years old, and the younger one was two years younger.</p>
<p>In that year, Hu Shansun took a fancy to the older one, and by intimidation and enticement, he got his hands on her, and even got the maid pregnant. Before long, this secret was discovered by Hu Shansun's wife, who gave the maid a thorough beating, almost to the point of death. Needless to say, she also hired a midwife to perform an abortion. As a result, the fetus and the mother both died.</p>
<p>After this incident, Hu Shansun's wife, in order to prevent similar incidents, assigned the younger maid to the eldest daughter-in-law</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When she had inspected or glanced over the dozens of dishes that had been presented first, she gestured to me, and I, in turn, gave Zhang De a knowing look. Zhang De then softly commanded his trained assistants, "Change them!" Thereupon, these young eunuchs, as orderly, solemn, and swift as soldiers, withdrew the first batch of dishes and brought in the second batch. Immediately, they simultaneously lifted the lids, then turned around and retreated to their original positions, standing stiffly. At this moment, the pungent aroma emanating from the various steaming dishes filled the boat, making everyone's mouth water.</p>
<p>During this time, the orchestras on the other two small boats continued to play softly. I couldn't help but feel a bit touched and began to daydream silently,</p>
<p>"Although I am the daughter of a subject and my status is far below hers, I know what seafaring is like, because I have personally experienced those boundless oceans. I also know how a person sitting in a large ocean liner is tossed about by giant waves beneath them. These magnificent and enjoyable aquatic voyages are infinitely different from messing about in a small boat on Kunming Lake. However, the Empress Dowager, limited by her own position and various court regulations, cannot experience such valuable experiences. Whenever she gets tired of playing on land and wants to be close to the water, she can only float for half a day on this artificial small lake. This kind of small boat pastime, in the eyes of someone like me who has experience crossing oceans, is really too insignificant. It's as if Her Old Majesty and I, as well as others, are a group of naughty children squatting by a small pond playing with water, while our nannies are not far away, carefully watching us, lest we get our clothes wet or fall into the water..." (344)</p>
<p>Correction: In the article on the 7th of this month regarding the Military Governor and the Viceroy, there was a sentence saying "Der Ling is a former Qing female official's room." The character "room" should have been "imperial clan." We hereby make this correction.</p>
<p>New Art Scene News: Mr. Yan Fusun, a renowned novelist and palm reader, is famous for his gourd character divination. After setting up his stall for ten years without a successor, he now wishes to make his art public and recruit several direct disciples. He will teach the art of character divination through correspondence, along with studying Chinese classics. Art will be achieved in half a year. Either invites that place to assist with the pen administration, or sets up a place to be born into the world on their own. Those who are proficient in Chinese classics and aspire to art may submit their qualifications. Even those who already hold positions can enjoy themselves by learning this noble and philosophical art. The offering fee is only thirty yuan per session, plus five yuan for lecture notes and miscellaneous expenses. It is said that there are still remaining slots, so those who love the arts should not miss this good opportunity! You can directly write to Mr. Yan Fusun's Gourd Seeking Knowledge Hall inside the New World Hotel at the Racecourse to register. Also, Mr. Yan has recently suspended his services due to a family bereavement, but he has now resumed his services as usual. Gourd character divination costs four yuan and four cents per session. For annual fortune telling, it costs eight yuan and eight cents. Those in other places can request a divination through correspondence.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<h3 id="e237">Returning from Visiting the Capital's Air Defense Exhibition <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Due to scientific progress and the development of the air force, the mode of warfare has now progressed from two-dimensional to three-dimensional, and the scope of warfare has expanded from the front to the rear. Therefore, aerial defense is now the primary task of national defense. My country's air defense efforts are still in their initial stages, and it will not be easy to succeed without the concerted efforts of the military and civilians. The Air Defense Committee of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission, in view of this, held an air defense exhibition in the capital starting on the sixth of this month in order to arouse public awareness of air defense and to popularize air defense knowledge. Choucheng happened to be in Beijing on that day due to a petition from the new medicine industry, and visited the exhibition the next day. Therefore, I have recorded what I saw below:</p>
<p>The opening ceremony venue was the public stadium, which can accommodate more than 20,000 people. At night, outdoor movies on air defense issues were shown in the stadium. The exhibition hall was set up in the First Park, and connected to the stadium. Above the towering archway at the entrance was a silver model airplane, with the couplet: "A country without air defense facilities cannot survive in today's world." "A populace with a self-defense organization is sufficient to cope with modern warfare." Behind the Sun Yat-sen's will monument, a bomb model was specially erected, measuring four meters long and weighing two tons, which made people shudder. Next to it was a billboard more than a foot square, depicting the tragic scene of a city being bombed by airplanes, which was shocking to the eye. It instantly reminded me of the disaster in Zhabei during the January 28th Incident, and I almost shed tears. Inside the First Exhibition Hall of Wandering Leisurely, there were various "photos of surveying and testing equipment" and "diagrams of the evolution of warfare." On a three-foot-long table, dozens of airplane models were placed, with detailed lists of their names, styles, performance, size, weight, etc., clearly marked in front of each plane, making them easy to understand at a glance. The anti-aircraft barrage balloon net had different styles. The one displayed in the hall was a net-shaped suspension type. Inside the reed shed were "artillery camouflage nets" and "parachutes." The former was covered with yellow mud and green grass, so that enemy planes would not know that artillery was hidden there when scouting from the air. The latter was twenty-four feet in diameter, divided into twenty-four folds, and connected to the belt by twenty-four silk ropes, which were used when jumping from the air. It was made of domestic silk fabric, which was even more commendable. There was also a board, divided into eight grids, which statistically showed the number of military aircraft in various countries around the world. A five-inch-long airplane model was nailed to each grid, with one plane representing one hundred. France had the most, with fifty planes nailed on, while Poland had the least, with ten planes nailed on. Other countries, such as the United States, Russia, Britain, Italy, Japan, and Germany, were arranged in order. From a distance, they looked like hundreds of dragonflies resting there. To demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-aircraft guns, a two-foot-high wooden platform was made, with anti-aircraft guns of various styles arranged around it, all pointing upwards. An airplane was electrified, causing it to fly in the air, and the mouths of the four guns moved back and forth with the plane, which was very ingenious. Various bombs were dissected and accompanied by explanations, in different sizes. The second exhibition hall was in the Geopolitics Society, displaying an ideal model of urban air defense facilities. The surveillance, intelligence, and alarm room, the blocking zone, the firing zone, the listening zone, and the surveillance zone were all determined by the distance from the center. In the basement, the houses were winding and fully equipped, serving as a bomb shelter during wartime. The third exhibition hall was in the Martyrs' Shrine, with a modern female model wearing a gas mask. Her mouth was three inches long, similar to Zhu Bajie in Journey to the West, which attracted the attention of the audience. Next to the rescue room was a human body model of a person who was killed by a bomb because he did not apply for air defense. His right ear and left leg were injured by the bomb, and the flesh was blurred, which was horrible to look at and lifelike. The park area was vast and had marked routes, so even though there were crowds of people, they were still orderly.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Intermarriage Between Whites and Blacks <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>A large part of the world's disputes stem from racial differences. If all the people in this world were of the same race, they would definitely be more polite to each other, and there would not be as many conflicts as there are now. Who knew that the God who created the universe would be so unfair, dividing the humans distributed across the five continents into five races: yellow, white, black, red, and brown, giving each race a different color in their skin pigment. This makes things difficult. There is a type of person who thinks they were specially made by God, that they are God's chosen people, and the most superior members of humanity. They not only think this way themselves, but also force those of different races to be inferior races, saying that you were made by God with the worst materials. Naturally, the superior and inferior races in the world are all assigned and settled.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to see a very interesting news item in the newspaper, saying that after returning from South Africa, George Bernard Shaw believed that the white birth rate was low, and that they would not be able to maintain their advantage in South Africa in the future. Therefore, he advocated that whites and blacks should intermarry. Shaw's proposal was obviously to maintain the white's advantage in South Africa, and not to break down the concept of racial difference. Unexpectedly, this sentence caused astonishment among all Germans. Germans are a white race, which is what I mentioned earlier: the superior race that considers itself to be God's chosen people. And the black race? They are an inferior race. Shaw wants the superior white race to intermarry with the inferior black race, which cannot but cause astonishment among the German people. However, Professor K. Eyssel, the South African ambassador to Germany, is a famous racial scholar, and he strongly disagrees with this view. He believes that Shaw's words are irresponsible remarks from a playwright. Not only does the South African government not think this way, but all white people in South Africa want to maintain the purity of their race, and believe that whites will be able to reproduce and continue in South Africa, and that white culture is European culture, which is a culture that cannot be compromised.</p>
<p>After all, Professor Eyssel is a famous racial scholar, so he has this kind of opinion. As for George Bernard Shaw, he is just a playwright who can only spout some irresponsible words.</p>
<h3 id="e239">A Visit to the Shanghai Free Circulating Library <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Shui</p>
<p>The hardship of work turns us into foolish silkworms:</p>
<p>We feel the hunger for knowledge more than bread!</p>
<p>This is what the Shanghai Free Circulating Library said in its recent founding statement.</p>
<p>The name Shanghai Free Circulating Library must be very unfamiliar to readers. That's right, this is what a few young people recently, as they said in their origin, deeply felt the hunger for knowledge in their work, and even more felt that many out-of-school youths in society, all people at work, deeply felt the hunger for knowledge. Therefore, they held this Make their own knowledge can be somewhat satisfied, and to make the general public who are also hungry for knowledge and in pursuit of some satisfaction, holding such a aspiration—this aspiration is said to be very small, but also very grand—established this voluntary circulating library.</p>
<p>Thanks to a friend's introduction, I recently had this</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>opportunity to visit the circulating library run by several enthusiastic young people.</p>
<p>I was deeply moved by the enthusiasm and perseverance of these young people in serving society. Therefore, I have to write down some of the thoughts I gained after the visit here to introduce the library and the general readers. I firmly believe that this is not an unnecessary task. In this society, the support for this library? I think it is naturally our responsibility.</p>
<p>The location of this library is at No. 13 Yangci Lane, Yuezhou Road (terminus of the 18th Road trolleybus) in this city. The founders are Yao Jun and several other young people who are enthusiastic about social service. They all have their own occupations, but they can better spend half of their spare time running this library. This library has only been established for nearly a month now, but the number of readers has already reached two hundred and sixty-seventy, and dozens of people come to the library to read every day. This library is completely voluntary, and readers do not have to pay any price to borrow books. There are currently about three thousand books, which are not complete, but there are some in all categories. According to Yao Jun, the readers are mostly nearby senior primary school students, accounting for about 40%, followed by small shop employees, and then workers and housewives in nearby factories. Yao Jun also said that the reason why so many nearby senior primary school students come to the library to borrow books is because these schools only know how to collect tuition fees and do not pay attention to the library facilities of the school. Secondly, whether modern education is beneficial to the general youth is also a problem. Therefore, these young people in the strong pursuit of knowledge have no choice but to warmly approach this small and simple library. This opinion is very accurate. From this, we can also see how urgently the general libraries in society, similar to this library, are needed by the general public who seek knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the question of books. Because their strength is limited, most of the books are donated. However, according to their experience, it is very difficult to donate books to people of status in the general society. On the contrary, general unfamiliar readers are their most enthusiastic book donors. Here, it can also be seen that this library, on the one hand, serves the society, and on the other hand, is based on the knowledge-seeking masses of the society.</p>
<p>The position occupied by this library is only a small room, but their enthusiasm and expectations for the future are very far-reaching. I hope that the general readers in society can give it the greatest support. We must remember:</p>
<p>Helping the development of this library is also helping the development of our own knowledge!</p>

<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>The strong sun shines on the cracked yellow earth day after day, and the weather gets hotter day by day. The tender rice stalks are scorched hot, as if they have been fried dry. The hearts of the farmers are also anxiously roasted like in boiling oil. After the Dragon Boat Festival (this Dragon Boat Festival can no longer be compared with the past, people's minds are all transformed into finding food to fill their stomachs, and no one remembers this festival anymore.), the weather is still so dry, but the rice's need for water is becoming more and more urgent. The air in the village is also becoming tense. In the fields, by the streams, on the winch-like water scoops, and in the small teahouses in the town, anxious faces and sighs can be found everywhere: "Last year was a year of famine, and the villagers have already lost most of their lives, and they still have to dig sweet potatoes to eat at the end of autumn. If this year is another drought, if this year is another famine, if there is no rain in the next few days..." Thinking, when facing the perilous scene, is feeble. When I think of the experience of being hungry for a year, it's like throwing a stone into my heart, pressing down heavily, and I no longer have the courage to think about it.</p>
<p>It can be said that the weather is really good. The strong sun shines continuously for the whole month, roasting like a roast. By the end of May, people have become dizzy, and even a short cloth shirt with a bare chest cannot be worn. People are full of fear and resentment, "Even the sky is working against people!" Thinking so, there is no strength to work in the fields, and the heart is half cold. People come back from the fields at dusk, walk past the water scoop, and glared at it fiercely, as if saying, "You will soon be needed, and you will soon be used to fight against God." Last year, when it was dry, more than a dozen families in the village used foreign pumps to save part of the fields, but this year, people are already "nine out of ten empty," and even sowing in the spring was a reluctant risk. Who can afford to use foreign pumps? There are still...</p>
<p>Nothing is happening. We, who are called "outsiders," spend four copper coins on a teahouse (the town's "tiger stove"), and someone will tell you about the situation in the fields. In fact, this is not bad; in recent years, whether it is farming or doing small business, there are many unspeakable hardships; it is originally a difficult year, and everything is not going well, which is also an understandable situation that can be expected!</p>
<p>(An old man, with wrinkles like messy grass piled on his forehead, and a thin, dark face, muttering like chanting a terrible curse, uttering unclear syllables:</p>
<p>"Farmland? It's really useless! Staying is also waiting to die. I'm old, if I were still young. Like you young men, I would have gone out with you to the north and south. Anyway, it's difficult to do anything these days. Wandering out, maybe you can wander out a situation, at least you can see more of the world! People can't even get enough to eat, what are you talking about ease, floating like a duck, isn't it good?")</p>
<p>The atmosphere of survival, wandering, and medieval pirates has also fallen on this small village. Hunger has pushed these self-sufficient, cowardly, narrow, and simple people out of the old village, and has given them a novel lesson from the outside world, a wonderful lesson like a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>(The strong sun is still fiercely shining, and everyone's heart is anxious: but, some younger, curious, and strong young men are increasingly interested in wandering: "Maybe the outside world is a better-looking one?")</p>
<p>In this way, there are already fewer young people doing fieldwork in the village this year—they are bravely throwing themselves into the outside world to find life two: and what fills the village is an atmosphere of sighing in the twilight of life.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Night Walk <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The city's nights are no different from its days; it's no exaggeration to call it a "city that never sleeps." It has become a habit for urban dwellers to return home at midnight. When one entrusts one's weary body to a rickshaw, the short journey feels like a pardon for a criminal. Leaning back in the carriage, legs propped up, free and natural, listening to the sound of the rickshaw puller's footsteps hitting the asphalt, a kind of passionate sound; or sometimes pulling over a road under construction, the carriage body swaying slightly like a pendulum, if I weren't constantly worried about a somersault when stopping, I could sleep soundly like a lazy pig; however, I was often woken up by the rickshaw puller. For years, I have been living a mechanical life. It is said that the city's nights are mysterious, but I have never really understood its true nature. It doesn't feel familiar to me, but it inexplicably grows.</p>
<p>The day before the Dragon Boat Festival, an old classmate from middle school invited me to his new home in Jiangwan. On the phone, he told me that he had spent a lot of time inviting more than a dozen old friends from our classroom at the time, and that this rare gathering should be enjoyed to the fullest.</p>
<p>Because I am a husband and have the burden of a family, I am often entangled in many unwilling things during people's joyous festivals; by the time I had dealt with all the difficulties, it was already evening.</p>
<p>For this rare gathering, I mustered the greatest courage and took a tram to Tiantong'an Station. Going to Jiangwan was not the first time. The small train gave me a good impression. The seats were comfortable and the journey was short. If you leaned against the window, looking at the clusters of green trees, and unintentionally eavesdropped on the trivial daily conversations of the villagers, the worries and hatred accumulated in your heart would disappear without a trace, like catkins blown by the light breeze of early summer.</p>
<p>As I got on the train, a drizzle suddenly started to fall. Before I could finish a cigarette, it intensified, and by the time I arrived at Jiangwan Station, white lines of rain were cascading down from the eaves. Almost everyone on the train had not brought rain gear, so they rushed out of the station to hail rickshaws. But when I was surrounded by a group of rickshaw pullers, I almost laughed. What was my friend's address? Yes, I had been to Jiangwan more than once, and because I was familiar with the route, I had never asked for the street name or address. In a desperate situation, I grabbed a rickshaw puller and told him, as if guessing a riddle, that I had to pass several bridges, those bridges were marked with six or eight tons of load, and turn left on the left side of a house destroyed by artillery fire. The rickshaw puller nodded repeatedly. He said that was called what place. I was already unable to listen to him. I hid in the carriage and urged him to pull faster, because the street lights at the station were turned off after the train left.</p>
<p>My body was full of rain. I drove past many roads in a daze. The rickshaw puller stopped the car beside a small bridge. I raised my disappointed eyes, and there was not even a trace of my friend's house in the vicinity. The two of us stood in the rain, guessing charades again.</p>
<p>After being resolutely rejected by the rickshaw puller, I could only grope my way alone. At this time, there was not a single passerby, and the street lights were so dim. I could not distinguish east, west, south, or north. Like a water ghost, I walked to a bridge marked with eight tons, carefully guessing the houses on both sides, as if my friend's house was nearby; but the most accurate marker – a collapsed house – was missing. I peered at the shops with closed doors, and in front of a white wooden door hung an advertisement for "×× Construction Company承造." This was originally the address of the collapsed house, and the place where I had just stopped was only a few steps away. I knocked on my friend's door, laughing to myself. They were surprised that I hadn't broken my promise as they had expected. At this night's gathering, everyone roused the naivety of when they boasted shamelessly in the past, the naivety that would never return!</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a rare night walk in the history of my life?</p>

<p>Some describe Yuan Meiyun's liveliness, saying she is like a little bird on a spring branch, others describe her beauty, saying she is like the bright stars and moon in the night, the gorgeous colorful clouds in the sky at sunset.</p>
<p>Indeed: Meiyun's liveliness is like a little bird, Meiyun's beauty is like stars and moon, like colorful clouds.</p>
<p>Meiyun is very young, just a girl in her youth, a girl who needs love to comfort her, but Meiyun has never shown any expression of love, although she has declared that she does not need love, but that is precisely the exposure of her ambition, she is now really a girl who needs love to comfort her, if you don't believe it, then you can prove it from a love song she sang in the sound film "Song of Triumph" directed by Wan Cang under Yi Hua's production, she sings like this: "The weather in June Jiangnan is clear, my sister goes to pick water chestnuts in the pond, the water chestnut tips prick the hand, the scorching sun shines on people, Oh God!, I have never seen it not raining during the plum rain season, I have never seen an eighteen-year-old girl not marrying, thinking of youth in the water chestnut mirror".</p>
<p>When Meiyun sang like this, her younger brother Jiusheng - played by Liu Li - shamed her and said: "Sister, aren't you afraid of being embarrassed?"</p>
<p>"Little devil, you are so bad." Meiyun's face turned as red as the sunset glow.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun yearns for spring, in the sound film "Song of Triumph" directed by Bu Wancang.</p>

<p>Formation of a Singing Team</p>
<p>In Tianyi's new sound film "Mother," there is a scene of studying abroad, which requires dozens of male and female students to sing the "Farewell Song." For this reason, Tianyi formed a singing team. One of the hosts is Miss Shao Suxia, who studies music at the Shanghai Art College, and the other is Miss Ding Zhi of the Lianhua Vocal Music Troupe. The other team members are male and female students from Daxia, Fudan and other schools. They are now stepping up their practice every day.</p>
<p>Joining of New Talents</p>
<p>The lack of new talents is the most important thing felt in the current film circle. Tianyi Company also needs new talents just like other companies, so Tianyi is also cultivating new talents.</p>
<p>Recently, two new talents have joined, one is "Miss Beiping" Bai Fen, and the other is "Miss Tianjin" Xu Lina. Both of them speak standard Mandarin, which is naturally what we need for filming sound films. What their future holds will depend on their own efforts.</p>
<p>Wang Bin's "Sea Burial"</p>
<p>The script for "Sea Burial," the debut work written and directed by the newly promoted director Wang Bin, has been formally approved after the initial review, and preparations are now being made for the separation of scenes, etc. The start of filming is not far away.</p>
<p>Wang Bin's "Sea Burial" is undoubtedly a powerful, rough-lined script. It is said that the play entirely depicts the struggling life of fishermen, and the intention is extremely great and sublime.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Mingyue Society Will Publicly Perform "Peanuts" Song and Dance Drama <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The new four-act song and dance drama "Peanuts" by Mingyue Society has a tragic and enthusiastic content, and is both sad and humorous. After half a year of rehearsal time, it has now been completed. In order to seek perfection in technology, it is still constantly rehearsing every day. Now it has responded to the invitation of a large Shanghai theater and decided to stage it at the end of this month, or at the latest at the beginning of next month. When this news reached the people who were fans of song and dance, they of course eagerly awaited the debut of "Mingyue Society." Chinese song and dance has reached a state of exhaustion, and only Mingyue is left as a slightly sound song and dance group in Shanghai. Their past achievements have not disappointed the audience. Now we are looking forward to them giving us satisfactory results. On the left is a scene from the performance by Bai Hong and Li Mingjian.</p>
