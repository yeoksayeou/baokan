<p>— 都</p>
<p>國民革命軍陣亡將士公墓。昨在首都舉行落成與禮。自林主席蔣委員長以下各部長官。均蒞臨致祭。五全大會中全體中委及代表。亦均前往參加。盛况熱烈。空巷其瞻敭先烈之徽型。增後人之遐思。其意義有足多者。</p>
<p>陣亡將士公墓。由中央黨部撥欵建築。於民國十八年開始籌備。至二十年春間方得正式開工。公墓之外。有祭堂·紀念館·紀念塔·牌坊等附屬建築。外觀旣極堂皇。部署亦復峻整。而位置於總理陵寢之東。尤足以昭示追隨之忠忱。亘生死而不渝。蓋此中毅魄。皆自嶺嶠振旅而還所喪失者。直接間接。胥在總理領導之下。以矢其服膺之眞誠。國民革命軍旣慶成功。若輩之血花肉芳。早已伴黃土而俱泯。在先烈捐軀成仁。原不計較於身後。而當道眷念袍澤。寧願獨歆其叨忝。故必欲得一具體紀念物以誌永思。亦情理中不能或少之步驟也。</p>
<p>抑吾人尤有進者。大部分之國民心理。習於委靡。憚於振作。已非一朝一夕之故。矯正策厲之道。端在以先烈之精神。供當世之觀摩。國民革命軍於舉國昏霾之巾。從事摧陷廓淸之工作。諸先烈奮發效命。視死如歸。激昂慷慨之氣。足爲一時矜式。雖今日時過境遷。而在首都羣流薈萃之區。有此巍然公墓之存在。顧名思義。卽不難使人油然生其嚮往之心。矧紀念塔之內外。猶滿鐫總理。黃埔開學詞以及吿別詞等各種激動文字。使涉足其中者。得藉瀏覽而資啟發。其裨益人心。尤非淺尠。循是而觀。陣亡將士公墓之建築。固將以振頑立懦。發濯來茲。又匪僅安妥英魂垂諸不朽而已。</p>

<p>— 錢華</p>
<p>第五、亡國慘痛的現象、最令人驚心動魄、永遠不能磨滅、記者到龍州時、曾登鎭南關遊覽、參觀歷史上我國戰勝法人的遺跡、撫今追昔、國難當前、外敵壓境、眞令人啼笑皆非、記者臨時等了一張出國護照、出鎭南關、入安南境、經文登而達諒山、爲黑旗軍劉永福駐節所在、軍事勝利而和議吿成、傷心歷史、不堪回憶、今日山河依舊、景象全非、那邊到處都是法國式的小洋房、柏油馬路、街道寬闊整齊、道旁樹木成蔭、有火車、有公路、交通異常便利、安南人較未亡國前、確享受了許多物質文明、但是精神上却有了狠深的創痕、記者會訪問過一個中產階級的安南人家、屋內都是破舊東西、也零零落落掛些字畫、知道我是中國人、臉上表示非常親熱的樣子、問他各種情形、只是嘆氣搖頭、所謂滿腹辛酸、盡在不言中、又參觀過安南小學校、主要科目由法人敎授、每週授法文安南語各半、安南文字本來也用漢文、街上地名門脾都用漢字、現在用法文字母來拚讀安南語、再過三十年、安南便無漢字了、即此一端其餘概可想見、那亦無　記者的多說了、</p>
<p>第六、桂林風景甲天下、諸峯悉自本地崛起特立、玉笱瑤參、森立無際、且山皆中空、巖洞深遠幽奇、加以離江沿岸、又有許多淸溪危澗、觸目成景、探尋不盡、在北平杭州外、別具一格、可惜未經人工收拾、交通梗阻、設備不週、諸山初無古剎點綴其間、旅客要下榻山中、秉燭夜遊、便覺困難、桂當局巳計劃桂林爲文化遊歷區、但無確定經費、記者意見應指撥一筆鉅欵、或募發公債、組織專門機關、從事遊覽區的建設、在陽朔良豐等名勝所在、多建別墅酒店、容納遠方旅客、廣印導遊等小冊子、桂林城內亦宜多設淸潔旅舍、各名山間應增建樓台亭閣、兼辦酒食茶點、桂林吃虧在交通的不方便、從杳港到梧州要二天、由梧州溯桂江上駛到桂林、在夏秋水漲時淺水電船約一日可到平樂、九十月後、水多淺涸、電船停航、祗有民船航行、需時十餘日、十分麻煩、現桂當局正在趕築由梧州至平樂之公路、明春可通車、兩地距離四百里、一日可達、從平樂到桂林水路陸路一天均可趕到、屆時從香港到桂林祗須三天、便利多矣、歐美日本各國對於遊管事業極爲注意、遊覽區的建設更作爲投資看待、利用各種宣傳方法、吸引遊客、如法國瑞士日本諸名勝區域、每年吸引遊資平均者數百萬元、乃至數千萬元以上、我國向不注意及此、桂當局如能稍加投資、深信每年利益的收穫、必較任何事業爲佳、至市面因此而繁榮、敎育文化因此而促進、更爲連帶的副收入也、</p>
<p>第七、廣西的省會爲何要設在南寗、眞是一個大疑問、在歷史上從明朝起、廣西省會即設桂林、到民國初元、因爲陛榮廷籍隸武鳴、距南寗約四五十里、一般趨勢依附者流　主張遷省到南寗、同時築成山南寗到武鳴的公路、是爲廣西公路之始、但南寗在任何方面　、都沒有做省會的資格、山水文物一無所長、全城找不出一處遊覽駐足的所在、記者在南寗時候、曾提出這個問題來和他們討論、主張省會設在南鞠的、有二大理由、第一便是廣西南部人口稀少、百業凋敝、且接近邊防、地極重要、倘省會距離過遠、則管理邊疆、有鞭長莫及之勢、南髯地勢偏南、與龍州尤近、一方面可以獎勵移民、同時可使邊防不至廢弛、第二則以南寗建省日久、各種建設、巳粗具規模、一旦冉遷移他處、物質損失過大、得不償失云云、但就記者的意見、正因爲南寗距離邊疆過近、不應設省、假若一旦邊境有警、龍州距南寗祇六百四十華里、敵軍長驅直入二省政治中心有動搖的危險、故就軍事上言、應　省　于較遠地點、至物質損失、更不成問題、南寗雖不設省、在商業上仍可不失爲南部重鎮、各項建設本亦需要也、還有一點最電要的、南寗附近爲一平原、無可遊之山水、公務人員于公暇都感覺到寂寞寡歡、沒有消遣的去處、婢賭旣懸爲嚴禁、再無遊覽地方、遂成爲枯燥、尤其是外省人到廣西去做事的、半載一年以後、便因是急于求去、抱着早離期士的念頭、桂省各種事業、借重于外省人材居多、人才不能長留、當然影響于事業前途的發展、故以天時、地利、文化、景物方面來講、廣西省會自以設在桂林爲最相宜、同時桂林遊覽區的建設、也必因政治中心的緣故、容易收事半功倍之效、其次當推柳州、柳州背山依水、形勢雄壯、位居桂省中部、處柳江的中流、東南下象潯到西江、西北溯紅河通貴州、南接邕龍、北出桂全、實有　　全省的形勢、但省會建設費時費錢、不如桂林之有現成規模也、今日敵國軍事侵略、每以空軍轟炸爲先鋒、航空母艦駛至欽州灣、距南寗懂二百餘里、一小時可飛行來同、萬一事變發生、政治中心發號施令所在、即有感受嚴重威脅的危險、如易爲桂林、則距海口約千三百餘里、比較上屬于防禦、此在對外關係上更應遷省者也、桂省執政當局主張贊同遷省的、當然亦不在少數、但是軍事領袖李宗仁白崇禧二氏恰巧都是桂林人、祇好避開擁護桑梓的意義、不作可否的表示、但爲桂省前途發展着想、自以遷省桂林爲是、</p>
<p>第八、桂省近年努力建設、政續優異、軍民合作、官吏勤廉精神、確極難能可貴、但有點應續桂當局特別注意者、便是中下級幹部人才的訓練問題、桂省的領袖人才都抱着以身作則的熊度來治理軍政大事、固然百廢俱興、治續斐然、但是領袖下面的中下級幹郁人才、多數或尙不明瞭眞正主義有服從心、而無創造力、依樣奉行、不知其所以然、基礎似尙不甚穩固、故今后當特別注重幹部人才的訓練問題、使下面辦事的人澈底了解施政的主旨、不是爲人而做事、是爲事而服務、然後拿訓練完成的幹部人才、送到民間去訓練民衆、使全省民衆個個有自冶心、有服務心、而桂省治理的成績方可保持永久、且永遠向前進展、關於中下級幹部人才的認識不足、事實上可以舉例證明者甚多、最顯明的便是服裝的更易、許多人在廣西省內當然奉令穿着灰布制服、但是離開桂省以後、便換了筆挺西裝、另是一副樣子、回來的時候冉換上布服、區區衣服問題還是這樣做作、心目中當然不了解他們領袖所提倡的布衣主義、舉一反三、對於主接的認識不足、確無可諱言也、（完）</p>

<p>浙省棉業推廣經過　（續）</p>
<p>收買種籽估計數量</p>
<p>從事實而言、吾人僅須取各實施區收花處巳收之改良籽棉數量、即可度知一切、茲爲明瞭起見、可將巳收買之數量及估計、及尙未收起之數量、作一數目統計、</p>
<p>區別　已收買數量　估計尙未收起數量</p>
<p>山　五十五、八六七市斤　六〇〇、〇〇市斤</p>
<p>定海　七五、三〇〇市斤</p>
<p>杭縣　一三二、一六〇市斤　一〇、〇〇市斤</p>
<p>鎭海　二、七七五、〇〇〇市斤　四〇七、八八〇市斤</p>
<p>慈谿　一、五七四、三〇市斤　一九六、七八〇市斤</p>

<p>餘姚籽棉　皮棉　一、二一〇、五八四市斤　一〇、一四四市斤　八〇〇、〇〇〇市斤</p>
<p>改良棉種棉質極優</p>
<p>汪氏又云、各改良棉業實施區所產改良棉、經詳細分析、其品質旣優、綫維又長經本處將定海改良棉及附近之土棉、送交實業部上海商品檢騐局農作物檢騐處檢騐、據檢騐之結果、改良美棉種、可紡三十　支細紗、土棉種則僅可紡十四支粗紗、由此足見改良棉種之較土棉爲優、此爲量明顯之事實、其他各區改良棉之較勝於土棉、是可斷言、現巳飭各區將改良棉陸續送該局分別檢騐矣、</p>
<p>各區收花籌欵情形</p>
<p>注氏又云、水年對於各實施區之棉產、原擬由政府籌集巨疑、由各合作社聯台設廠，全部統收統銷、當時業巳擬定經營計劃及預算、航遞曾廳長呈核、總計所需欵項、共達一百五十萬元、巳决定擬向上海中華建設銀團商借、由本人分途向各銀行當局、送經磋商、適當時因白銀問題、銀根奇緊、借欵之事、未獲結果、如是不得不改變方針、預定所需欵項、旣未借貸成功、而設廠全部統收統銷之計劃、亦不得實現、乃縮小範圍、分區各別進行、使收花之舉、不致停頓、乃由各區抵借欵額、收買所產棉花、茲將各區借欵收花情形、可作一概述如下、</p>
<p>杭縣　杭縣方面、向中國農工銀行抵借流動欵四萬元、由合作社組織聯合收花處收買、</p>
<p>蕭山　蕭山係向交通銀行杭行抵借流動欵五萬元、由合作社組織聯合收花處收買、</p>

<p>近日長江舫業、情况變異、來貨與乘客均减少、獨川河一綫、有大批新輪增派、茲分錄詳情如下、</p>
<p>雜糧停運</p>
<p>九江漢口各埠雜糧運滬、爲畏江各埠來貨之冠、自本月十五日起、上海糧雜帮某　等號、突發電至潯漢兩埠、囑令將已購定之雜糧、迅停止裝運來滬、九江漢口等埠、在上星期五起、便無雜糧運來以致各公司長江下水班輪、近日到滬進口貨、亦大爲减少、內之輪船到南華各地者、亦蒙聯帶的損失、運輸淸淡、業務减色、</p>
<p>客脚衰落</p>
<p>國營招商局長江輪全部九船、除江靖外、餘仍爲業務主任包繳制、而該局江輪、向以客位爲主、故江華、江順、江安、江新輪、均列作頭等船者、近來長江各埠、不論上下水班、旅客乘船者·衰落至極度、而局內因包繳制度、不負客票營業興衰之責、由是各江輪業務主任、因生意淸淡賠累甚多、殊難久持、各人集議結果、聯合全體江輪業務主任、以呈總局、要求將每月包繳　脚、就本期統减百表示也、</p>
<p>考查航業</p>
<p>交通部航政司長高廷梓、爲考察長江航業、以謀國輪之復興、故於十五日、先到南京招業寗分局視察訓話、再往蕪湖視察、昨日本埠得電、高司長已乘江新輪至安慶、視察皖中航政、定今日轉乘江安輪赴九江、歷漢口而往沙市宜昌、對揚子江全綫航業狀况統須澈底考查、以爲國輪復興長江業業、計議根據云、</p>
<p>川輪大增</p>
<p>今年秋季、川河輪營業之佳較平時最高額之各輪收入、約增十二倍至十五倍、爲向來所罕見、民生公公公司獲利尤巨、購買捷江船本、巳早收回、茲更因貨擁船缺、水脚狂飛、該公司急再添造及購買新輪八艘、以資擴充、在本月底可以出廠行駛者、有（一）民興輪係合興廠承造、至年底落成者，有（二）民運輪、及（三）新民康輪兩艘、均江南廠造、又有（四）民熙輪、（五）民來輪、（六）民蘇輪、（七）民視輪、（八）民聽輪等五艘、亦趕工於此四五月內出塢行駛、尙有民泰民聚等兩艘、則改爲專運桐油及雜貨之駁子、此後民生輪之行駛川河船巳達五十艘以上、蓋本年秋冬兩季、驟增十六七輪之多也、時勢造成、實出意外、據航業界中人言、如招商局當時購買捷江輪行至今日、水腳上巳可有四百萬元牧人矣、</p>

<p>本人經營之申新·茂新·福新·等廠前因原料缺乏、曾全部停工、現巳陸續開工、但仍因原料及銷路關係、工作斷續不定、現麵粉市況、較過去爲漲、其故因各地麥子、均巳銷罄、原料缺乏、粉價遂漲、而各廠工作、因之恒無定時、前本埠每月可銷三百五十萬、現祇可銷售半數、實際上巳呈减少、而外國原料、因成本關係、並無進口、近來市面衰落、食米反較食麵便宜、</p>

<p>— 瀋公展　（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們—</p>
<p>（六）總統是應該認爲總攬「洽權」的政府首領，故原擬憲法草案所定「總統總攬行政權」的條文，應該修改爲「總統總攬治權」，庶幾與五權憲法所創造的「權」一能劃分的精神相符。故五院院長均可由總統提出人選徵得國民大會同意後命之，而不必由國民大會選舉。至於立法委員和監察委員則可由立法院院長監察院院長分別按照各地方人口比例，提出人選，不以國民大會的國民代表爲限，（至少過半數爲國民黨黨員）呈請總統批准提出國民大會通過後任命之，庶幾國民大會雖閉慕，也仍有一部分的國民代表得以參加立法和監察的工作。異他如立法院或監察除職掌中有任何涉及一政權一範圍以內的職權，都應劃入國民大會的職權之中，或至少須提經國民大會或</p>
<p>臨時國民大會通過，方能生效，以淸權界</p>
<p>（丙）關於黨的組織者：</p>
<p>（一）國民黨內部的組織應更求其跋密，在總理而外，應設置總裁（或領袖）一人，總攬全黨的指揮事宜。於總裁之外、另設中央執行委員會爲議决黨綱政策的機關，總裁有最後决定之權，並負指導執行的任務。</p>
<p>（二）中央黨部應盡量活動，掌握國民大會的重心，其他各級黨部也應盡量活動，掌握各地方議會參政機關的重心。</p>
<p>（三）省或特別市黨部的執行機關，應改選舉制爲特派制，一律由中央黨部特派委員一人至三人主持之；其監察機關，則仍由各級自行選舉。</p>
<p>（四）縣或區黨部的設置與否，由各省市斟酌地方情形條陳中央核定之。（完）</p>

<p>上海之有毛冷製造，乃近年來之新現象，其中可分兩種，一爲專門製造，如上海中國博德運等廠，一爲兼營製造，如過去之振興章華兩廠，乃於舫職毛絨製品之外，兼紡毛冷，再如怡和及上海紡織兩廠，乃以棉紡織業而兼毛冷製造。今將主要各廠情形分誌於後。</p>
<p>一，裕民紡織公司</p>
<p>裕民紡織公司係法租界興聖街各毛冷號合資創辦，於去年九月成立，資本國幣十萬元，地址在上海法租界興聖街四十三號榮茂昌樓上，並不另設工塲，蓋其出品雙洋牌及雙手牌兩種毛冷，全託白利南路安樂棉毛織廠代製，所需之羊毛，係託德記立興及義華公司代向澳國採購。</p>
<p>二，上海毛絨紡織廠</p>
<p>上海毛冷紡織廠係王啟宇俞佐庭郭順等鉅子合組而成，設立於去年十月，資本十五萬元，總發行所在寗波路三四九號，工廠在楊樹浦路六十一號，專紡毛冷，以四股絨爲多，每日可出一千五百磅，其商標爲小囡，至其他金狗雙貓雙種尙未開製。廠內有機器十餘部，紡毛椗子六百支，連其他附屬機器，總値約十萬元。雇工數百餘名，以女工較多。</p>
<p>三、中國毛絨紡織廠</p>
<p>中國毛絨紡織廠與裕民上海不同，係浙江廉興人陳志廉獨資經營，資本約一百五十萬元，本年七月間始開工製造，工廠設於監靑路一八八號，佔地十二畝許，其機器由德威洋行代向法國廠家定購？計有打綫車二部，併綫車一部，拉綫車八部，椗子車五部，以及零伴馬達等，約値二十萬元，雇工約五六十人，今突然興起於市塲上之皇后牌毛冷，卽爲其出品品。</p>
<p>四，博德運絨綫廠</p>
<p>上海博德運絨綫廠，係由英倫之總廠分來，其總辦事處及工塲設鄱陽路定海橋北，營業部辦事處設於北京路二號，資本約華幣一千萬元，廠屋於去年底落工，正式開工在本年三月間，每日可川絨綫一英磅，所雇男女工共計六百餘名。出品之牌號除熟知之蜜蜂牌外。尙有杜鵑鸚鵡兩種。</p>
<p>以上四家，爲專門製造毛冷之新興工廠，此外如英商怡和紗廠亦兼產五福牌毛冷，日商上海紗廠亦兼產無牌毛冷，混銷市面，因非專營，遂不細載。今將各廠所出毛冷之最近市價列表比較於下。（單位元）</p>
<p>廠名　毛冷牌名　批發價　門市價</p>
<p>博德運　蜜蜂　二、九〇　三、二〇</p>
<p>博德運　杜鵑　一、五〇　——</p>
<p>裕民　雙手　一、七〇　二、四〇</p>
<p>上海　小囡　一、五〇　一、九〇</p>
<p>中國　皇后　三、〇〇　三、三〇</p>
<p>怡和　五福　　、八〇　——</p>
<p>上海紗廠　無牌　二、五〇　——</p>
<p>一般言之，因競爭及銷路凝滯之故，本年毛冷市價較去年略减，惟最近新貨幣政第實施以來，羊毛來價昂貴，各牌市價最扳又轉趨上漲矣。</p>
<p>裕民之　羊牌與上海之小囡牌，過去曾一度跌價競銷，雙方均受相當影響。惟本年九月問，裕民公司曾向上海毛絨紡織廠定購小因牌二百包，雙方有開始合作之意，此實華商合作以禦外侮之佳音也。博德運所產之蜜蜂牌，歷史旣老，而其推銷力量又大，實爲華商之勁敵，其間差堪吿慰者，卽其銷路主要限於華南，至華商方面則偏向華北，或不致針鋒相對也。總之，民族毛冷業今後能否繼續發展，一方有賴於國內政治經濟之整飭繁榮，他方亦有賴於有轉於外來壓力之善於應付也。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我們都需要這些小小的帮助；所以你得勉力學習你的功課和工作，以一種善意和童子們玩要，好好利用你的假日；假如你可以給我一個優良的報吿，或者我雖然不說，郤是巳見到了，知道了，因爲我很會覺察到我的童子們一切向善的努力—那末你可以贏得抽屜裏的一部以便安放你的寳物。你看，有些抽屜巳經區分爲四個小部分，別的抽屜我也要吩咐照此辦理，每一部分作一星期之用；等到那抽屜裝滿了珍奇美麗的物事，我必與你一樣得意，我想更加得意—因爲在那些鵝卵石，靑苔，以及美麗的蝴蝶裏，我將見到良好意志的貫澈施行，過失的自制與諾言的克踐，我們這樣做去好嗎，唐恩？』</p>
<p>童子不作一語，只向他一看，然而其神色中實巳顯出他深切感覺與了解她的言詞與願望，只是他對於那種愛護與好意不知道怎樣來表示他的感謝罷了：牠也明瞭那種神色，幷且見他滿面通紅，知道他實巳受了感動—這正也是她所希望的—她於是對於那柿新計畫，不再作一詞，但抽出那最高的抽屜，刷去其塵灰，放在蘇乏前兩張椅上，忙說道：</p>
<p>「現在，讓我們立即起頭放那些有趣的硬殼蟲在安全的地方。這些格子可以容放許多東西，你看。我把蝴蝶和昆蟲釘在四邊；這末它們是很安全了，留出下底置放大件頭。我要給你些生棉花，潔凈的紙和別針，這樣你可以準備做本星期的工作了。</p>
<p>「可是我不能出去找新物事，」唐恩說道，看看他的脚，露出可憐的神氣。</p>

<p>許文奎朱文極之表演甚佳妙　交大散漫無力光中難支大厦</p>
<p>約翰大學足球隊、擁有健將多人、最近又得本屆全運福建代表徐承勛之加入、實力益見雄厚、昨日與交大十之戰、交大一籌莫展、許文奎朱文極輩、均有極精彩之表演、交大太形柔弱、薛文繡周光中難支大厦、結果三對一交大再度敗於約翰、</p>
<p>上半時二對一</p>
<p>下午三時半裁判員比撥爾氏銀角一鳴、兩隊列陣對壘、交大先取攻勢、氣燄殊甚、約翰許光耀救球心切、一不留神、以手觸球、被罰十一碼、由邵濟華主踢、一腳出去八球向左上角進入、紀錄遂開、約翰乃努力前衝、朱文極邊陲起義、至適當地點、送入中央、許文奎接得來球、拉起一脚、應聲入網、一對一無分彼此、中綫開球後、周光中獲得來球、遠送文繡、奈求勝心急、失之太高、負負而返、約翰李光興盤球前進、派於朱文極、文極豈敢遲緩、用力一脚、直向交大門前而來、被程國印踢出不遠、范家駒乃前衝求救、却反被朱文極剩機而入、輕輕　撥、球又入網、自後球常盤旋於交大門前、幸賴家駒身手靈活、救出不少險球、結果二對一、約翰佔先於上半時、</p>
<p>下半時一對零</p>
<p>檸檬過後、約翰調進生力軍、交大則原班人馬、戰來殊爲散漫、踢球亦無力、後衛又形不固、錯誤累見、周光中雖滿塲飛奔、又何濟於事、約翰却愈戰愈勇、徐承勛於三十碼處對門直射、急而有力、惜未命中、朱文極看得眼紅、竭力撕殺、范家駒不慌不忙、兩脚一碰、球乃彈出、交大難思挽回、而力不從心、薛文繡又兩次失機、毫無建樹、約翰陳繼恩從右邊前進、正擬送入中央、苦無援軍、即對門而射、竟吿中的、此球淸晰美觀、從此你來我往、各無所獲、下半時約翰又以一對〇勝、結果一對三交大再敗、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>上半時</p>
<p>下午二時半開始、裁判銀角一鳴、雙方列陣迎戰、復實中堅安樂生、八面玲瓏、確有大將風度、中鋒胡宗益、盤射功夫、亦有獨到之處、故開賽未及五分鐘、即由小胡攻擊一球、未幾、毛康叔邊陲起義、連闖三關、復中王紀法措手不及、只見輕輕一撥、又中鵠的、內鋒朱文章不甘示弱、錦上添花、亦進一球、此後胡宗益又來一脚、上半時結束、復實以四比零佔先、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>檸檬時間過後、易地再戰、此際復中力圖反攻、奈前鋒聯絡見佳、後衛防制鬆懈、復實三前鋒　隙淮攻、勢如破竹、林家錚胡宗益先後奏功、毛康叔董炎光冉中紅心、此後一來一往、各無建樹、結果八比零大勝復中、雙方原是自家兄弟、客客氣氣而散、茲將兩隊陣綫錄下、</p>

<p>— 朱鎭</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>帮助兒童獲得健康的和滿足的生活是教育一主要目的之一種，如要達到這種目的，學校對一於牠們本身的全部程序、課程·方法·管理·行政組織，以及物質上的設備—應根據心理衛生的觀點予以改變，學校中應當先規定一個標準，俾從這標準中去判斷兒童的行爲是否是眞正不善適應（Maladjustment）的特徵，如果是的，學校就應設法帮助這種不善適應的兒童得到較優的社會上和情緒上的滿足。</p>
<p>學校中應滿足兒童的第一種基本的需要就是自動的表現，—兒童精力的一種出路，供給這種出路的方法往往利用公共集團生活，在這種集團生活中兒童的一切活動都是根據他們的興趣，而不是以他們的知識地位爲標準的，這種方法如手工·音樂·及藝術表演·烹飪·攝影·以及其他的中心活動在小學三年級時就可以開始利川。</p>
<p>學校中應滿足兒童的第二種、本需要是使他們參加社會化的活動，所以學校本身應該成爲一個自由的和民主的社會，在那裏面兒童可以負起保時校舍和草地，計劃會議的節目，討論他們入課室或禮堂的秩序以及管理學校的小商店，圖書館或膳堂的種種責任，當然的，在這些責任中不應包括審判罪犯，和科以刑罰，因爲牠是與心理衛生極相反的。</p>
<p>兒童社會化的精神乃在集團生活活動或設計中所養成，例如我們可以令一年級的兒童設立一個郵政局，再令二年級的兒童建築一個遊戲塲，到六年級時兒童可以組織工會，設立學校銀行，和發行學校的一切用品，在這些設計中兒童可以儘量根據他們的興趣謀精力的發洩。</p>
<p>學校中應滿足兒童的第三種需要是安全的意識，他們如要達這種目的一方面是藉自動的表現，一方面係藉社會活動的參加，不但在學校中如此，就是在家庭中處處亦要使他們能感到安全。</p>
<p>（二）課程</p>
<p>從心理衛生的觀點看來，一切的課程應當把那些眞正對於兒童生活有功用的一部份包括進去，課程中無用的和無意義的部份應該刪除，所以我們採用合乎心理衛生敎育的課程標準應該是實用的，但是還有一種標準就是兒童不能勝任的敎材應當在兒童成熟之後再供給他們，現代學校中對於兒童心理上的準備往往都是忽略的，所以我們應來研究那一種敎材對於兒童心理生長的每一個時期都是適宜的。</p>
<p>（三）管理</p>
<p>管理在心理衛生的意義上是包含敎師的訓練，敎師在未敎兒童之前應有心理衛生上的知識，旣敎之後，應時時不斷地追求，其次是包含敎師中的合作精神，同時學校中應予敎師自由，使他們有創造的思想，並允許和予他們參加計劃·研究·課程的組織，甚至决定學校行政方針的機會。</p>
<p>（四）行政</p>
<p>倫使嬰注重兒童情緒上的安寗，在學校行政的組織上應廢除成績的不及格和留級的制度，傳統的學校行政制度對於這一點是不注意的，他們徵罰學生而不顧到這種懲罰的情緒上之影響，例如在美國文奈特卡學校中學生的每種功課不給予成績或等　的，在他們的報吿單的學校和品行上只記一『　』（Sotifactory）（滿員）或一負「」號，每個極愚笨或極聰明的兒童都應該要得到「S」記號的成績，他們認爲負號對於兒童的情緒容易損害的，所以他們的敎師都設法使負號多多减少，其次是兒童的試卷或測騐的改正方法亦應與一般不同，卷上的錯誤及更正地方雖都指示出來，但對於在班中競爭的要素應絕對禁止宣佈。</p>
<p>所以爲兒童心理衛生方尚着想，學校中的整個行政組織應有伸縮性，俾課程，方法及其他可以適應每個兒童。此外物質上的設備對於兒童的心理衛生亦是重要的。所以學校中對於兒童的創造工作和社會化的活動應有合理的物質上的設備。但是這種設備並非需要許多金錢去購置　，因為牠們多屬於兒童工作的各種工具，以及工作的材料。最後課室中的空氣，應該家庭化的，非形式的，和布置能悅人心目的</p>
<p>（五）培養兒童常態的行爲</p>
<p>我們無疑的對於兒童之無妨害的不善適應總是忽略的。在外表服從敎師的兒童往往不會引起敎師的深切注意，其實在他們內部或早巳有一種不樂的情緒，或不能滿足慾望的壓制了，這種內部壓制比外表行爲所表示的不善適應還來得危險。所以這種行爲决不是兒童的常態行爲。在另一方面，我們對於騷擾和叛亂的兒童，總是極注意的。並且常認爲他們的行爲是變態的，其實像這種兒童所表現的行爲，乃是常態的行爲，從兒童的械終的情緒生長的觀點看來，是極有價値的。因此，我們希望小學敎師對於兒童不要專用壓制的方法，應讓他們的情緒儘量表現出來。例如在美國文奈特卡學校中對於這一點非常注意。他們常請精神病學專家到每個課室中觀察兒童的行爲是否是常態，俾設法施行補救。而在敎師方面亦在收集，每級中常態的適應與不善適應的兒童之材料來做研究，期從這種材料中能編成一種社會的和情緒的行爲的量表，以决定在各種成熟時中的兒童常態行爲。</p>
<p>（六）尾語</p>
<p>心理衛生在小學校中實在是一個重要的問題，但不幸常爲一般所謂敎育專家們所忽略。我們如要解决這個問題，單靠校長和敎師的力量是不够的。我們勢必還要求助於心理學家和精神病學家，所以小學校應該聘請這種專家專任指導才好。這—點在今日人才經濟均感缺乏的中國敎育界中固然不易辦到，但至少小學校長及敎師應具有兒童心理衛生的常識，這樣，在消極方面或亦可以獲得相當的成績。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>新貨幣政策施行以後，雖物價有一度之上漲，但以購買力之薄弱，最近巳能回復原狀。惟且前國貨界最痛苦之一點，則爲原料之飛漲。此種原料商，以法幣改革後心理上之戚應，認爲漲價之絕好機會，居奇操縱，轉陷國貨廠商以重大之困難。胡君西園，早見及此，曾懇切函勸原料商人漲價切勿太驟，記者極表同情。蓋原料漲價，最困難者，實爲中小之工廠，彼等一方面以購買力未見激增，無法增高售價，一方面反須購入高價原料，成本突然提高，此種矛盾性之環境，確爲國貨界目前最大之暗礁。倘長此過去，必致國貨之銷路停頓，而原料之需求减少，兩敗俱傷，作繭自縛，胡君巳慨乎言之。記者深願原料商人同在此過渡時期，應放太眼光，顧全大局，萬勿抱自私自利主義，乘機漁利，以斵喪國貨之命脈，而自貽伊戚。至於國貨廠商，尤應於同業間切實合作，聯合同業，躉購原料？更應明白外匯的手續，打破中間商之壟斷與欺騙，則困難之環境，未始無好轉之望也。</p>

<p>本月四日，財部停止使用銀幣，改中央中國交通三銀行鈔票爲法幣，事前經若干經濟學專家之研究，財政當局之縝密考慮，而始毅然實行，利益甚多，今將關於吾國貨界者，略述於左。</p>
<p>（一）金融流通我國近數年受世界不景氣之影響，加之災患頻仍，復加以美國增高銀價，現銀不斷外流，雖加徵平衡稅，仍不能止，因之我國現銀存底日少，市塲籌碼缺乏，工商業今年雖勉强渡過四底七底十底，金融呆滯，日益顯著，勢必至整個崩潰不止，今改法幣後，現銀集中，偷運可以絕跡，而因銀幣不通行，人民必盡易法幣使用，市面上籌碼可以增加，金融流通，不至如以前不死不活之狀。</p>
<p>（二）物價提高年來國貨諸廠，因銷路呆滯，金融不能週轉，閉歇者有之，停工者有之，减工者有之，岌岌不可終日，改用法幣後，各種物價，相當提高，農村經濟，可以活躍，則國貨之銷路，可以推廣，當不似往日之奄奄無生氣矣。</p>
<p>（三）匯兌統制我國近數十年來，年年入超，金錢外溢，外人縱不以政治亡我，卽經濟亦足制我死命，法幣改訂以後，國際匯兌，統由中中交三行主持，一方面匯價可以穩定，不至暴漲暴落，受人操縱，一方面實施貿易統制，調整進出口貿易，則我實力脆弱之國貨界，不至爲國際資本主義所打倒。</p>
<p>我國貨界同人乎，國家巳盡其職能維護我行將沒落之國貨界，吾人應如何奮勉，一方面應與銀行界密切聯絡，一方面整齊步伐，宜如何合作，謀人才之集中，成本之减少，製造之優良，出品之迅速，管理之科學化，此千鈞一髮之時，亦卽我國貨界最後之起死回生之機會，望諸君其奮起。</p>
<p>吾親愛國人乎，國家興亡，匹夫有責，覆巢之下，寗有完卵，其自今日起，立志服用國貨，國家前途，實利賴之。</p>

<p>五全大會經濟組審查報吿，有一伴很値得紀述的議案，便是請由政府切實維護棉紡織業解除一切困難案中，减輕借欽利率及運貨，認爲救濟一般實業之要圖，擬請大會通過原則，交由政府規定實業放欽之法定利率及减輕運費辦法，轉飭主管機關辦理。這是國貨界的新生路，是幾年來國貨工業不發展的最大癥結。試看東西各國的工廠，其惟一的後盾，都是銀行。而銀行貸欵的利率，從沒有像我國所規定的。所以同一工廠，他們的利息，不逮我們的半數，利息旣微，成本自低，雙方競爭，我國工業無論怎樣努力，當然屬於失敗之列。此點記者赴日考察工業歸國後，一再陳述，並爲國貨界竭力呼籲，輙以政府方面，未有法定利率之頒布，終未獲見諸實施，目擊高利率之流行，國貸界之忍痛負擔，常常慄慄危懼。今日工業之疲隳，巳到這般地步，甦生的方法，固然不止一端，而减輕利息，已爲一般有識者所公認。五全會經濟組中，已能抱住救濟工業的要點，作根本的方策，記者認爲這的確是國貨界惟一的新生路。</p>

<p>論語上說：「必也正名乎」，可知事物的名稱，必須先有指定，倘事物沒有規定眞切的命名，祇隨口加以胡亂的濫呼，日久以後，必將以誤緾訛，而使羣衆深深印入不良的印象，若永久不去糾正它，旣非正名之道，也許會貽笑外邦哩。</p>
<p>國貨中有很多的物品，盡是本國製造出來的，偏偏冠以「洋」字，像洋火，洋燭，洋傘，洋鹹等等；正是不勝枚舉，這些物品旣非舶來品，不知何以硬要加上這個「洋」字，實在是寃哉枉也！而且對於提倡國貨的意義上，也太覺矛盾吧！依照鄙意這類物品的名稱，都有從速更正的必要，譬如「洋火」儘可改稱「火柴」，「洋傘」改稱「陽傘」，「洋鹹」改稱「肥皂」，「洋燭」改稱「蠟燭」，（此稱如認爲不妥，可以再改）那末旣規定了國產的固定名詞，而呼喚起來也好聽得多，更免得以國產徒冒「洋」名的嫌疑</p>

<p>改良家庭展覽會，在南京路福利公司學行，記者應國貨工廠之招，前往觀，進門之頃，中西男女，雜沓其間，大有戶限爲穿之概。陳列計七十八間，以西商爲多，自下層至三樓，布置殆滿，國貨工廠之陳列出品者，僅五和織造廠，美亞織綢廠，中國化學工業社，景綸衫襪廠，冠生園等，布置優美，煞費經營，五和之鵝牌衫，久已膾炙人口，幾使人有一見白鵝，卽聯想及於汗衫棉毛衫之概。是廠特置白鵝數頭，當世不乏右軍，定饒別趣。美亞之綢緞，化學工業社之化妝品，歐美婦女，亦多問津，認爲媲美舶來，大可一試。歐美婦孺到會者尤多，星期日下午，幾至宣吿客滿，有券者亦感無門可入之憾。</p>
<p>是會也，與其謂爲改良家庭生活，無寗謂爲提高家庭生活。苟中人以下之家，不顧自已力量，亦欲羨此奢侈生活，以充滿其享受慾者，則舍負債外無別徑。不過不學其物質生活，而學其精神生活，則衛生淸潔，整齊，美觀，他山之石，可資攻錯也。</p>
<p>吾以爲如此種之改良家庭展覽會，滬上國貨工廠，不妨聯合社會團體，如靑年會，家庭日新會，學生國貨年推行會等，選擇交通便利與地位寬敞之區，集滬上著名工廠之出品，就人生衣食住行上之必需品，作系統之陳列，爲科學之設置，廣邀各界士女，到會品評，宣傳遊藝同時並舉，每日排定不同之節目，以吸引各界之觀摩，則其意義更大，效力更宏，而價値亦更巨。至如提倡僥倖心理之彩券，與不可捉摸之猜數，屬於下層社會之賭賽運氣，反貽展覽會之玷，甚屬不取，我國貨工廠開辦時，尤當絕對避免，免使識者詬病也。</p>

<p>— 李光黃</p>
<p>前次參觀華商上海水泥廠後，曾略爲記述，近見世界風雲日亟，水泥爲建築事業之基礎，且與媒鐵等同爲現代工業之要素，其產銷關係於一國工業之與衰至巨，爰特濡筆記之，供諸國人。</p>
<p>該公司工廠設於滬西龍華鎭近郊，若擬參觀先往上海四川路六號上海水泥公司內與事務所接洽妥當，由其指定日期派員招待。</p>
<p>廠址位中國航空公司飛機塲之南，自築媒屑路以通龍華鎭，車馬可直達門首，四圍多職工寓所，儼然另成一市鎭，進內又須塡明參觀簿，暫於會客廳中稍坐，旋卽有人出面領導觀覽各部。現在我日依照了水泥製造的經過，逐步叙述下來，也許就可以比較淸晰些吧！</p>
<p>水泥一名洋灰，英文稱日Cement，故又譯作水門汀或士敏土。其主要原料爲石灰石和黏土，我國大江流域盛產之。該廠將這兩種原料品從江邊起岸，卽行分別裝入小車中，車身上均有白字標明，而車數比例，則按其分量支配，同時便由機械駕駛，沿軌道直入工塲，車係鐵製，作斗狀，名曰運送斗。原料進屋，自動傾於鋼珠磨中，空斗則仍返江邊，循環不絕。石土二物在磨中混合研細後卽落入連續爐中燃燒，爐形如圓筒，頗長大，共有二爐，平行橫亘地面上，此息彼作，每日交換一次，一端有長烟突，高聳屋外，一端有口可望火，蓋燃燒須有一定熟度也。余窺之殊耀目，領導者乃取旁置之顏色玻璃架障眼視之，果爾。不傷目力幷能由火熖之不同而知其燃燒之稈度，待至爐火已足，卽須退出使冷却，再磨成粉，經篩後便成水泥，裝桶運出，商標是爲象牌，每日產量約一千五百桶，因該廠東濱黃浦江，自建有碼頭，故進出運輸尙稱便利，惟因市上外貨傾軋，聞是項出品銷路頗受影響云。</p>
<p>致於該廠內所有一切機器之原動力則均發自蒸汽臥輪（Steam　turbine），電壓二二〇V.（弗）每綫上電流四〇〇〇A.（安），功能一千五百K.A.V.，折合之約等於八六六K.W（基羅瓦特，簡寫作瓩）。足供全廠工作之用也，</p>
<p>更須交代明白一句；就是在廠內是禁止攝影的。參觀時間約二小時，親見我中國有此新興事業，衷心至爲快慰也。</p>
<h3 id="c195">請印刷界竭力採用國紙 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 意鴻</p>
<p>現在，國人設立的造紙廠，和出品種類，據我所知道的一二，記出像下列的表：</p>
<h3 id="c196">廠名 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 出品種類</p>
<p>龍章　龍章連史紙，道林紙，（這是新出的質地很好）</p>
<p>天章　道林紙，圖畫紙，書面紙，（天章紙廠現在雖然是暫時停頓但是市上存貨還多）</p>
<p>江南　連史紙，毛邊紙，（另有一種連史紙質地很堅結的可以用墨水筆寫）</p>
<p>大中華　同上</p>
<p>森記　同上</p>
<p>就照上表所列的各種紙張，（雖然新聞紙中國尙在製造中，還未出世，）己經是很適用於各種印刷品，足以替代洋紙。價格還比較洋紙便宜些。</p>
<p>眞痛心的，我知道印刷界和用紙的人，不免還有一部份，是麻木不仁，不加注意，不來提倡探用。試看—現在市上的一般印刷品，很可以用國紙來印刷的，老是在用洋紙。洋紙，大概總要占十之七八的成數。</p>
<p>這印刷所和用紙的人，不肯竭力採用國紙，我知道下列所述的種種情形，或許也是一部份的原因：</p>
<p>一，印刷所與紙店關係印刷所與紙店，有訂定貨物上的往來，那末印刷所向紙店取用紙貨，是很便利的。不過有的紙店，沒有預備那要用的一種國紙，於是，只有供給洋紙。印刷所却懶於另向他家訪購國紙，也有印刷所向訂定往來的紙店取貨，或是不須現欽；而要另向他家取貨，那勢必另備現欽。在這種種情形之下，印刷所貪易苟安，就不採用國紙。</p>
<p>二，紙店備貨紙店大多是辦洋紙的，有的是與洋行家訂定往來，其牽製情形，也和前條所述的一樣，要另備國紙，就有些麻煩了。於是，便於推銷的，只是洋紙。也有或許國紙廠家給與紙店的貿易上的利便，不及洋紙的好，那末，紙店就不大願意推銷國紙。這二種情形，也是國紙不能暢銷的原因。</p>
<p>三，過去的不良印象在過去，國紙品質，還未達到至善的程度，印刷所有用過而不滿意的，那就永久存了一個鄙視國紙的觀念；不管現在的出品，比較以前是好得怎樣，總還是口口聲聲說，國紙怎樣的不好，而不肯再與以試騐和採用。</p>
<p>四，冷的態度這不可說沒有，竟然有若干份子，是冷的態度，甚且做反常行爲。他認定只知道是自己賺錢，有什麽國紙和洋紙的分別呢！用國紙與他有什麽多大關係呢！一定要用國紙來替代洋紙，那於他是大可不必的。倘然有人，鄭重地要請他探用國紙，他要暗笑人家是「戇」。或者竟然會故意地說：國紙的價，怎樣貴；質，怎樣不好：中國人做不出好東西來，究竟洋紙好，等等。他所備的國紙紙樣，或者是陳舊的，低劣的，並非最近的較好出品，價格隨意地提高。這種種反宣傳，當然，很容易銷减人家採用國紙的熱忱。</p>
<p>以上都是實在情形的一些，是約略地就一隅所記到的而說。現在，國紙最近的出品，確已比較以前進步得多了！是很可以替代洋紙了！請印刷界和用紙的人，尤其是各機關，各銀行，各公司等等，要添用印刷品的時候，不論大小，多多注意，竭力採用國紙。倘然要知道國紙的詳細情形，那可以直接到各該紙廠的辦事處，或者各國貨機關，探詢一切，索取最近的紙樣才是。</p>

<h3 id="c197">小型報的發展基礎 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 建屏</p>
<p>小型報，在大報小報化，雜誌趣味化的過程中，突然以其活潑的姿勢，出現於我們的讀者面前。改革後的「時代日報」及出版不久的「立報，」可以說就是上海這種小型日報的翹禁</p>
<p>小型報，旣不是過去的舊式小報，也不甚一般小報化的大報。它是以輕巧整潔的新姿熊，獨立於這兩種—或者許多種報紙當中。過去舊式的小報，大多數是以穿鑿某些掌故奇談，偉人軼事及士女風流爲中心，它的目的，是在以上述的題材，供一般有閒階層及無聊份子茶餘酒後之玩味。雖然過去也有一二家（如上海報等）轉移視綫，以分析時事及秘聞　對象；然以掌故軼事，風流事件爲題村，却依然是舊式小報之主要特點。</p>
<p>小報化的大報，雖然不儘如舊式小報之專以叙述要人軼事及名妓風流爲中心；可是其描寫的題材及立脚的重心，依然還是以近於體育新聞男女事件含有趣味性質者爲主。上述這兩種報紙，其目的雖同是以吸收一般有閒份子以及某些店員小商人爲對象；但在我們看起來，均不能算是小型報。</p>
<p>所謂小型報，依照我們看起來，至少應該具備下列幾個條伴，即：</p>
<p>一，精確明白，沒有大報的繁重，而有大報的豐博；</p>
<p>二，淺顯經濟，能使大多數人讀得通，看得懂及買得起；</p>
<p>三，能處處站在大多數人的利益立塲說話，能多量發表工人，小店員及中學生的意見和文章；</p>
<p>四，能以嚴正的態度，敎育大衆，及領導大衆。</p>
<p>所以小型報在這些條件上，它必須每天都有簡潔而精幹的社論，有緊要有系統的政治消息，國際新聞及社會新聞。最好能每天有次序有系統地將一般重要的政治消息及國際新聞摘要歸納起來，用最簡明的筆調，分析剖解。間並挿入時事漫畫，使讀者得在極複雜的國際事變中，抓住其轉變的重心，省得自己在廣泛的新聞中，去理解或摸索。其次，它必須以極輕巧的筆調來寫文章。最好酌用簡體字，並時時登載中學生，店員及工人的作品，或記述關於他們日常生活有關的趣味事件：如「葉仲芳的自白」之類作品。同時，更須設立「靑年信箱」或「工人信箱，」使一般大衆有說話的園地，並得照他們的環境，時時給這些大多數的讀者解决困難的問題。最後一點，則應該在某種可能範圍內，登載較可靠的政治新聞，社會新聞以及文化消息，並時時不忘爲大多數人的利益而抗爭。故小型報之建立條件，並不僅在於它的簡單輕便；而是在於它能接近大衆，抓住大衆。因爲簡單便宜，固是小型報之所以爲小型報之一因素；但獲得大衆的擁護，負起敎育大衆，領導大衆的任務，却是小型報之成立及其發展的唯一基礎，沒有這一基礎，則小型報即使小至極點，也是不能仔在及發展的。</p>
<p>所以，在目前中國新聞界正在用更新的方法以接近廣大的讀者層當中，我以爲進步的知識份子，如果能在種種的經濟條件政始條件及人事倏件的壓迫下，堅持其接近大衆，敎育大衆的主張；不斷地保持其一定的態度及改善其報紙的內容；則小型報之發展基礎，是必然會一天大地鞏固起來的。</p>
<h3 id="c198">德國的書業交易所 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 唐克明</p>
<p>因爲社會的不景氣，出版事業也和其他企業一樣，陷於極度恐慌之中。出版家不想把出版方法加以健全的組織，而僅在生意眼上作勾心鬥角的競爭，結果自然會江河日下，絲毫沒有起色。這裏想把世界液完善的書籍發行組織—德國的交易所制度—介紹給讀者及出版家。</p>
<p>百年前，在德國萊比錫地方巳經有了今日世界上最完善的書籍發行組織—即是交易所制度。首肇此基礎的是德國的三大書商；巴士登（Potstan）的胡佛期（Horvath），紐倫堡（Nuremberg）的開潑（Campe），愛爾敏（Fmenau）的佛愛脫（Voight）地址圾初是在里去特（Richter）的咖啡店中，繼遷至神學院的敎室中，該時凡來華比錫的書商，皆以此處爲市塲。發起人佻給了必需的設備和物品後，於是始有交易所的組織。直至一八三六年時，該組織正式有了固定的房屋。</p>
<p>該組織轄治下之會員，都須遵守規約，承認書業之傳統習慣。書業交易所，德名為Borsenverein，其初起時所訂的規約，目的在以最大的努力使書業本　蒙受利益。不但外表如此，事實上該組織確巳成爲發展書業最活躍的機體。</p>
<p>他們有一中心局所，用以討論許多營業上的重要問題。在此時期中，最使發行者與書商困難的是書籍缺乏版權保障。有趣向又可使人注意的是五十年前萊比錫之成爲書業中心，其一部份之成因，乃是對私印書籍之嚴厲限制。遠如一七七三年，萊比錫的書業市塲上，私印書籍的發行與販賣，早巳正式禁止了。所以到萊比錫來出版一本新書，是較至弗蘭克福（萊比錫的商業對頭）爲足以使人信仰。加以數年前，北德意志書商的一致禁入弗蘭克福市塲，更使萊比錫的書業，蒸蒸日上。雖至今日，在柏林出版的新書，其數量是較萊比錫爲多，但萊比錫始終不失爲德國書業的出版中心。</p>
<p>書業交易所開始時，會員只一百零八人，但其努力却是依年月而俱增，至今日會員人數已超出五百以上了。</p>
<p>種種的進展和改善，使德國其他部份的發行者，都携帶資金，到萊比錫來找求新的生命，於是書業交易所也日臻興旺。</p>
<p>隨市塲營業發展而俱來的是代理人的需要。最初只是發行者感覺到，漸漸書商也有此需要了。現在，不居住於萊比錫的書業交易所會員，無論發行者與書商，都僱有一個代理人。此種制度，不但使萊比錫成爲書籍生產的中心，且也成爲書籍發行的中心！</p>
<p>在日漸進展中，書業交易所立刻覺得有發行商業報紙的需要。一八三五年，名「德國書籍販賣業交易所價單』的報紙出現了。一八六七年起改爲日刋。內容包涵新書廣吿，書籍叙述，書局報吿，試閱劵等。如此，交易所，發行者與書商間每日都有密切的運繫了。尤其是書商，在購書時可按步就班，不致茫然無所適從，因之在効率上與秩序上，增進不少。</p>
<p>於是，現在有了一種正式的公報，將與德國書業有關連之一千三百餘組織，予以扼要的叙述，當一書局發現時，就將其營業的種類的股東姓氏，所僱用之代理人等，用鳥瞰式的寫法叙述一個大綱。</p>
<p>總之，書業交易所是一個很複雜的機構，但在書籍發行方法上，是代表極大的成功的，美國仿之，在紐約也有一個與Borsenverein類似的組織，其名稱是Bookseller's　Clearing　House其他如英法荷蘭諸國，也有步其後塵的傾向。</p>
<p>爲明白起見，假設購買書籍之程序，以闡明此書業交易所制度。</p>
<p>例如漢堡有一書商，他要購買出版於門興與弗蘭克福的書籍。每一個書商那裏都有一種表格。這種表格的格式大概是一律的，大小總不出三寸長四寸寬。現在將此種表格的原式，抄錄如次：（見下毘所排表格）</p>
<p>表格有平常的和急速的兩種，後有「十」字記號，是需要急辦的，大致接釗後，噹日原郵寄還。</p>
<p>現在如要購買某種書籍，就將發行者的姓名塡於表角，更在空白處塡上所要購買之書名。漢堡的書商，塡好了表格數紙後，即郵寄其目的地不是出版書籍的門興和弗蘭克福，而却是萊比錫。信封上寫明出版者駐萊比錫代理人的姓名。代理人收到此表格後，即到事務所中，將對方所需要之書籍，打成郵包，交與此漢堡書商駐萊比錫的代理人。然後拿到郵包淸算處（Pecket　Auctansch　Stelle）付郵寄返其主人。就情理論，郵包付後，購書之欵即須交付，但普通總有一星期左右的延緩。所以兩者之間，也如銀行一樣需要記賬的方式。</p>
<p>急速表格了結後，然後再注意平常的表格。其進行是和上述方法一樣的，也要待郵包到了書商代現人手中，郵書與其當事人後，手續才算吿終。</p>
<p>註（括弧內係英文註釋）</p>
<p>用交易所制度購買書籍，其利點概括之可得下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）所有書商的表格，都楚一個信封，寄給一個地方的。（萊比錫）</p>
<p>（二）書商可省去寄給許多發行者的滙票的麻煩，同時發行者也可免去記載收到白餘書店或書商的匯票的手續。</p>
<p>（三）整批的寄，郵費也可節省不少。</p>
<h3 id="c199">書店雜景（續） <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>其次新書店大部經濟情形較爲支絀，不得不量入爲出，這與總編輯的出書計劃，也相違背，因而常有總編輯决定了稿件，甚或發出了稿費單，而總經理屬下的會計，堅持不發的。以前，書店總經理因此與著作人或編輯打架的事件，時有所聞。不過，總經理與出版統一起來的也很多，在那些老闆兼總經理的書店，自然是無問題的了。</p>
<p>實在說吧，新書業到現在還在墾荒時期，尤其是現在，更當風雨飄搖之際，總經理的責任是極大的，有許多書店的盛衰，都以總經理爲轉移。總經理大部兼任營業主任，有的甚至不設營業主任，所有營業事務，全由總經理獨攬。這於書店的營業極有影響，縱有好書，而沒有好的推銷，書是不能不脛而走的。但可惜在新書店中，總經理官僚化與惡化的也還是有。有的總經理「做小貨」，即把易銷的書，多印一版作爲自己的收入，或是自設紙行或印刷所，與自己所擔任的書店相交易，决不命其書店一不喫虧」。有的書店總經理吞公欵，有的總經理腐化，彷彿一做書店總經理，即踏上了做官的雲梯，天天去官塲鬼混，甚至有的以爲自己巳是了不得的大亨，於是天天開房間打麻將呌堂差。這表面上雖屬於個人的私事，但其影響所及，對於出版界文化界的損失是多少大？</p>
<p>（五）店員</p>
<p>新書店的組織，規模大小各有不同，所以店昌的情形，也很差異。書店規模大的，分工自必較繁，店員的種類自必也較多，如商務中華等幾家大書店，各部分工頗細，同爲店員，自分部主任，以至小夥計，其性質是截然不同的。但同時，大部份的新書店，如四馬路上林立的，都是規模不大，因之，所謂店員，其職務大都是差不多的，有的甚至老闆，經理，店員，都是同一人，當然也有幾個別的夥計），這種家庭作坊式的書店，店員所處的地位自與大書舖不同。</p>
<p>大概，在規模不太大，也不太小的新書店中，店員是有相當重要性的，因爲在這種書店中。除了經理等一三人員外，支撑營業全部的，便是這種店員，因爲其分工不大，所以性質也差不多。而且，今日新書店中，正是這類書店爲多，所以我們這裏可即之爲　象，來談談其中比較有趣的情形。</p>
<p>先說店員的來源。因爲新書店的歷史還不久，所以完全爲適應新書店的需要而產生的店員，並不很多，有許多書店的店員，大部還是舊式書店中的夥計，這種人，他們稱之曰內行，此外，即稱爲外行。在這裏，也可看出新書店經營方式的非現代性。不過，這不過就多數而說，並不是說新書店沒有新式店員，反之，現在即在逐漸發展起來，那些從舊式書店店員所轉變過來的店員，很有被淘汰之勢。</p>
<p>店員的僱佣，權在總經理或經理手中，所以總經理或經理對於店員决定的作用頗大。就因爲新書店大部份還沒有走上現代組織之路，「封建的』因素還很大，反映於店員僱佣上的，便是同鄕及親戚的援引。你看，就是開明，那裏的店員不多是紹興人嗎？洪雪帆時代的現代，所有店員不多是寗波人嗎？再如北新，大部份店員，據說也是與李氏有關的，其次，規模更小一些的新書店，自更不必說了。</p>
<p>比較這種情形更落後的，還有學徒制度的存在。有許多書店大部份的店員都是學徒，有的甚且全部都是學徒。這是新書店經營者很大的一個認識錯誤，他們以爲書業也是和其他售式商業一樣，可以利用「價廉而又便於控制的」學徒來負祖一切職務。以致新書店的店員大多一知半解，甚且連字都識不了多少，你走進這種書店去，不但那些店員不知道來怎樣招待你，而且，有時你問他有沒有那一類的書，他會拏出絕對相反的書來給你，你指名問他嬰那一本書，即使這本書就放在他面前，他也會瞠目不知所對，甚而竟至說沒有。要這樣的人夾發展新書業，眞的，不亦難哉？</p>
<p>好像爲適應時好，各書店也曾有過一時，大家競用女店員。在日本，丸善，三省堂等幾家大書店，所有店員幾全是女店員（男店員大多在較高級的指揮地位），而其能力大部比中國的男店員還强。譬如你問他要托爾斯泰全集，她會進而介紹你杜伊托夫斯基全集等，她們店中有的書决不會不知道放在那裏，有時，這書是她們那裏所沒有的，她會還吿訴你可到什麼地方去買。而在中國，女職員一般的還免不了花瓶的尊稱，就是在作爲文化事業的書店上，也還是一樣。最早，僱佣女店員的是張競生博十所創立的美的書店，那裏的女店員好像祇懂得張博士的幾本大著，使一般書痴子，一進美的書店，反弄得像是鄕下人進了跳舞塲。後來，上海各業對於僱佣女職員的風氣比較開通了一些，，大家對於書店的女店員比較沒有以前好奇了，但是，據個人的「私見」，好像一般書店女店員的能力還是不很高明，而且，仍免不了一點綴之嫌。大東書局在門市部新屋落成的時候，各部有許多女店員，這些女店員，對於顧客的應酬似乎有些勉强。隨着大東景氣的消逝，女店員也眞和瓶花一樣，不久即消失。現代在擴充門市部的時候，也有一批一美麗一的女店員，有幾個本想到裏面去揩油翻閱文學書的窮朋友，因之却步，有時有顧客對她們作賣買，很有幾個女店員表示出一種羞怯的樣兒。和大東一樣，現代的女店員不久也消失，這更表示出女店員好像是書店在有錢時候的一種裝飾品。現在書店僱佣女店員的巳不多，女店員的能力也不見增加。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c200">政治家的諾言 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>英國下院總選舉，已於十四日舉行，前數日，競選運動，甚爲劇烈。依形勢看，這次選舉，殊不利於政府。蓋工黨在各工業區域內，勢力頗爲堅强。內閣閣員之在工業區域候選者，甚形狼狽。尤以國民工黨領袖樞密大臣麥唐納，更不能得人信任。麥氏最近在西漢港礦工區域發表競選演說時，會塲常起紛擾，致每言未畢而退。甚且有於麥氏出會塲時，加以呼叱者。按麥氏爲西漢區礦工所選出的國會代表，這次不受人信任，卽因麥氏所諾言，無一加以履行。如國際問題，軍備問題，關稅問題，麥氏食言而肥。而最爲人民所需要的工資問題及生活能力測騐問題，麥氏於事前曾作種種諾言，事後亦無一加以履行。故今番麥氏雖復提出各種諾言，實無怪礦工之羣起責難，不再加以信任。</p>
<p>政治家（卽政黨亦然）之能得人信任，不在未登台時的諾言如何動聽，而在執政後能履行其諾言。儘管一個政治家於競選運動時，對人民說盡許多甘言蜜語，若在得人民擁護之後，食言而肥，立刻便失去人民的信任。像麥唐納卽是最好的例證。麥氏於前次選舉時，深得西漢礦工的擁戴，這回反受責難，便因爲他不能履行以前的諾言。在西漢區與麥氏競選的候選議員興威爾，說他是種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，倒是不錯的。蓋人民雖受愚於一時，豈能被騙於事後。等你一上台，就能看出馬脚。不但把先前的誓詞遺忘，卽對人民所作的諾言，亦丢在腦後。這結果，民望盡失，人民罵的駡，怨的怨，有的忍不過，便將他打倒。可見政治家的諾言，非出於誠意，萬不可輕發。十目所視，十手所指，你的一舉一動，那能逃掉人民的監督。</p>

<p>— 蔣德敬</p>
<p>那起伏不定的追憶，好像一條褐色的小蟲，一等到心頭有一刻的寗靜，便慢慢地爬上來，爬到心坎的深處。</p>
<p>奔逝的歲月，帶若那迷茫的往事，像在霧裏，漸漸地遠去，遠去，只剩些隱約的影子。我要這影子報吿些歲月的奔逝，却是怎樣的使人痛心，我想撇開它，但那褐色的小蟲，又帶着它慢慢地爬上心頭來。</p>
<p>那小蟲用她那織細的脚爪，鈎住心頭的絃綫，彈出很微妙的音樂來。我俯着頭，用我的全力去領略它的韻味；——是這樣低低的，在訴說它的憧憬和幻思，期望和留戀。過去的歡樂，只是山頭的夕陽，將全世界在一時間內敷上美麗的彩色。但是很容易的就沉入黑夜，那可怕的黑夜；都是些睜着冷眼的星星，閃鑠着，在互相竊笑。</p>
<p>我徬徨，在聽着這樣幽怨的音樂，但是我不能再聽下去，它要使我流出淚珠來，我要立在萬仭的高岡上，向着無垠的蒼芎長嘯，劃破碧玉般的長天，飛到天後的世界裏。那裏沒有奔逝的歲月；褐色的小蟲，永遠沒有爬上心頭的時候。</p>

<p>五個女神，自從鍊就了五色彩石，補全了天的缺處，創造了太陽，驅逐了「黑暗」，她們就在這優美的世界中，奏着無聲的音樂雝融。不知過了多少的歳月，她們是難能記憶，祗看那月兒圓了又缺缺了又圓。（二）</p>

<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>這長是一間暖閣，在花廳的側裏，臨窓有厚絨的窓帘遮着，後面側弄裏沒有光綫，暖閣裏就異常陰黯。夏天這問屋子是鎖起來的，冬天，老爺和太太在鴛驚榻上舖一付烟盤，整天兩個人幽居在裏面。老爺是個瘦長子，這時候捧子只水烟袋在榻前徘徊，暖閣的面積沒有二丈闊，鴛鴦榻幾乎佔去三分之一的地位，再有茶几靠背的據割，僅餘楊前數方尺的餘地了：老爺因此不能像在花廳上時大搖大擺地踱方步，他幾乎脚跟碰脚尖地跨三步，又得回過頭來了。但是他現在的注視力完全集中在女兒的身上，一根紙煤將燒到指尖，他還沒有抽過一袋烟，而這樣小小的來回他已走得很自然了。太太呢，是個高大胖子而自己體重每天在增加的一個中年婦人。他躺在鴛鴦榻的上首抽烟，那樣子似乎一堆棉花胎，或是一件遠道歸客的大行李。太太沒有出嫁之前就高大胖子，現在她更不敢輕易說出胖子兩個字了。她側轉身抽烟是感到頗爲吃力的，所以平時總是老爺在下首做替工，太太祗要把槍嘴凑上了自己的，閉上眼晴抽一個爽快。今天和老爺鬥過嘴舌，她不願意自己服輸，老爺旣不肯代勞，她也不得不親自上手了。但是沒有抽得一筒烟，那堆棉花胎已經彷徘在急速進行中的引擎了。</p>
<p>老爺手裏的紙煤燒上了指頭，他纔驚醒過來，停止了徘徊，又一鼓氣衝到嘴邊，對太太質問：「這件事倒底怎樣辦法？」</p>
<p>太太沒有過得癮，又不能支持側着的這個超過老爺一倍以上體重的身子了，她用足氣力把烟盤一推，身體翻向了天，才舒服地吐了一口氣：</p>
<p>「女兒又不是我一個養的，倒笑話！」說過了覺得口氣太輕，猛地從鴛鴦榻上坐起身來，因爲老爺沒有提防，幾乎撞了個滿懷，一邊就衝着老爺的面說：「問你做老子的呀！養不敎，父之過，還有臉來問我，虧你問得出！你這老……」一時接不上一個適當的名字，因爲太粗野的駡語倒底太失了「太太」的身份，就停止了再躺下身去，舒服地吐了二口氣。</p>
<p>「養不敎，父之過？」老爺接口了；「我讀了這末多年的書倒不如你，養不敎，父之過？有你這位娘攔在前面，還有我爺嗎？現在幹了這種不要臉的事，倒想着養不敎，父之過了！</p>
<p>老爺從烟袋裏重抽出一支紙煤，就着烟燈的慘綠的火焰燃了，反一屁股坐到鴛鴦榻的下首抽水烟袋了。太太一個翻身面對了老爺，但是想不起什麼話來回駁，就打了個哈欠，把烟盤拖近身邊，醮着烟燒起來。</p>
<p>這時候專管理暖閣的小了厮探進頭來了——或許他已在閣外站了半天聽着老夫妻兩個的鬥口—輕輕地報吿：「舅老爺！」</p>
<p>老爺把紙煤揮了揮手：「說我不見客。」</p>
<p>太太却捉着了老爺的錯頭說：「不見客？抬什麼了不得的官架子！是我的哥哥，我要見！阿福，請舅老爺進來。」太太想旋過身去，大烟却在火頭上曉了起來。</p>
<p>阿福的身體剛巧退了出去，舅老爺已經踏進暖閣了，他對着妹丈就是一揖到地，老爺就不得不放了水姻袋還揖，乘勢把下首讓與了客人，自已退到窓前的靠背上坐了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，」太太多了個帮手，雖然沒有過足癮，說話的聲音自然地粗了：「你替我評評這個理看：你來替小鳳說媒，他橫不答應豎不答應，其實那樣的人家也辱不了你的官架子；現在小鳳逃了，唔，走了，却又是我的不是，哥哥，你評評這個理看！」太太餘怒末息地把手指遠遠點着老爺。</p>
<p>舅老爺先來了陣笑聲：「我聽了這消息才來的。現在事不宜緩，應該把小鳳找回來了再說，妹丈，你以爲如何？」他想了想：「這雖然不是什麼不干不淨的事，傳聞開去，倒底是妹丈的面子。」舅老爺夾着笑聲一字一頓地說了，等候着妹丈的答覆。</p>
<p>妹丈抬了抬頭，沒有接口。太太却說了：「多說什麽？女兒又不是我一個人餐若的，由他去罷！」</p>
<p>「妹妹，你不要火上澆油！」舅老爺虎了付正經面孔，「這是男人家的事，妹丈總會慢慢想辦法的；不過，事不宜緩……」從鴛鴦榻上站起來，慢慢踱到窓前。</p>
<p>妹丈似乎不好意思再冷下去了，「由你法罷！我譬如沒有養得這個女兒！「說着自顧出暖閣去。</p>
<p>舅老爺跟着到暖閣門口，見妹丈的影子進了花廳，回過身來對殊妹吐了吐舌頭：「那就好辦了，保在我做舅舅的身上。」用右手拍拍胸脯。</p>
<p>「這老鬼什麽事都不順我的意思！」太太勝利地笑了，扭動着臃腫的身體對舅老爺說：「哥哥來躺一會罷！」</p>
<h3 id="c204">遊玄武湖 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 楊仲碩</p>
<p>出了玄武門，那條筆直的馬路在綠楊垂柳緊裹當中越發顯得它的雄姿勃勃氣象萬千了。</p>
<p>我有點怪癖，生平就不大喜歡附庸風雅，看風景也就如此，時人稱道激賞的處所，無論它是古跡也好，名勝也好，我都好像視之漠然無動於中似的。這種不近人情的褊性，也許得致遺傳，一半却是涉世較深的緣故。好比說我前幾年在杭州，因震於柳浪聞鶯，曲院風何的名曾糾集幾個朋友去玩過一次，未去以前總以爲這地方一定了不得，結果却是敗興而返。</p>
<p>但是這回遊玄武，却感到非常愉快。算起我來南京也快半年了，除不得已去過一趟中山陵外，可以說足未出戶，玄武湖自然是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>據說玄武湖的好處在那滿湖的荷花，然而現在此刻不但荷花早已凋盡，便連那些蓮葉也都枯黃死了。</p>
<p>荷花雖凋，蓮葉雖死，但是玄武在秋老將殘的今日，却有着蕭索凄婉的美，記得有人拿春天的西湖比喻一個豐腴的女人，那末秋深的玄武該是一個嬌小端莊，態度頗爲嚴肅的少女吧。</p>
<p>是星期休假日，早上曾有陣雨，下午雨雖然停了，天空仍舊陰晦得令人發愁，不過遊人却並不因天陰而减少。</p>
<p>揀定一處旣在流覽風景，同時又可以略避冷風的地方坐下，我們便開始談話，毫無目的地。</p>
<p>「其實玄武的好處在它有湖之名而無湖之實，你說它是湖，却沒有湖必具的條件，當你踏進玄武門的的時候；你所見的除了幾片雜在枯荷中的淺水之外，你簡直找不出湖的痕跡。大家者曉得，搆成湖最重要的條件就是水。像玄武湖的那幾片淺水眞不能符合一個湖的名稱，可是它的好處就在這點，假如玄武是一個綠水注注的蓄水湖，那種丰姿綽約的美是無論如何不會有的」。</p>
<p>以上是老余的一番議論，為免除爭執起見，我們都沉默着，因爲我們都深知老余的個性是十分堅强的。</p>
<p>然而依我的意見，玄武的特點不在湖的本身而在那些搆成其特色的背景，像那巍峨秀逸的山色，那古色斑爛的城垣，再加上滿湖的枯枝殘葉便成功了這人工與自然交織成的錯綜景緻。</p>
<p>你沒有逛過玄武湖，擬决不會覺得南京城垣的偉大的，那堵婉蜒的巨牆是那麽森沉嚴肅地兀立在那里，爲這名湖生色不少！</p>
<p>有人說，玄武湖頗有點像故都的北海。在夏末秋初的時節，那滿池姣艷的荷花，那碧綠的荷葉，在在都有着北海的特點，可惜，現在此刻荷是枯黃凋殘了。使我不能將北海和玄武比較一下。這，未始不是我此次逛玄武湖的缺减。</p>
<p>玄武湖更有一點北海。沒有的好處，那就是說北海失之太人工化，而玄武却有不少自然的美麗。</p>
<p>我們在「亞洲公園」歇了一忽，跟着又逛完了「歐」「美」「菲」洲各處，遠在水中的「澳洲」，爲省麻煩免除跋涉起見却沒有去。</p>

<p>好時光不斷地流，好鳥兒不斷地啾，人們的快樂遍地留，憑你怎樣投：休想快樂洽心頭，包你苦樂滿腹愁。向誰吿訴，向誰開口，關在心頭，一腔煩惱，萬千眉愁。奈何！奈何　放在心頭。春去也不能長留，春來不會長久，人們的環境　宇宙，何必苦相求？祇現前不顧後，得過目過別計籌。不要吿訴，不要開口，記在心頭，無庸煩惱，無庫眉愁。奮鬥！奮鬥！放在心頭。</p>

<p>西藏到南京，相隔數萬里，由道險阻，無交通西綫，所以西藏方面固然思想不到南京一切的龍盤虎踞之象，南京的人士也一定料諒不到西藏一切神私的程度，可是現在却有一個驚人的消息，便是正個神秘的西藏已搬到一國首府的南京。</p>
<p>原來月明公司的「神秘的西藏」一片，巳於昨日由李法西携到南京去了。</p>
<p>『神秘的西藏』一片不只可以說是一九三五年月明公司最大的收獲，同時也可說是中國電影界僅見爲嘉寳，國難嚴重的環境中，邊疆問題是國民一致集注的視綫，尤其是西藏，這一個包含着無數奇妙故事的地域，每個中國人有神秘的憧憬，神秘而無由知其神秘，其神秘的程度，自是不可說了。</p>
<p>「神秘的西藏」不只是揭示神秘的面目，同時也剖晰了神秘的內層，這一影片實是每個國民所應覜覽的。</p>
<p>「神秘的西藏」預備在南京假勵志社，或首都戲院邀五全諸公一觀，使爲國諸賢對古國的邊疆先留一印象，然後檢查即在首都上海二地公演。</p>

<p>外國的商品大批地運輸到中國來，中國的一切工業都停滯下來啦！單憑綿紗一項，每年的入口，總在數十萬噸以上，這樣中國的工廠只有關門了，一大批的工人到什麽地方去我飯吃哩？於是種種勞資的殘酷的鬥爭擺在我們的眼前，全家失業餓死的新聞，也使我們看見了，還有許多更殘酷的，我們不易看見的，正不止有多少呢？</p>
<p>高古非在「船家女」中，他就遇着這樣殘酷的事情，那天他的工廠，突然停了工，爲了要飯吃，他不得不集合了全體的工人，會議着，要求工廠復工，在工廠的門口，他們高呌着：「我們都是有家小的，我們以後該怎麽辦法呢</p>
<p>「我們明天就要沒飯吃了，我們總不能餓死呀？」</p>
<p>高占非的腦袋上的靑筋暴跳着，狂呼的聲音，使邊觀者的人們的血管都沸騰了起來。朋友，這是一幅極　現實的圖畫。</p>

<p>岑寂了很久的劉壇，最近似乎又活躍起來了，各劇社　連地上演，而尤以業餘劇人的「娜拉」「與欽差大臣」更獲得廣大觀衆的擁護，而顯示了中國劇壇不可限量的前途，爲了愛好戲劇，爲了使中國劇壇更穩固的建立起來，業餘劇人王力民何康理等二十餘人發起了一個揚子江劇社，在數月前就有了這麽一個提議，因了發起人等忙於「娜拉」與「欽差大臣」的公演，故致遲延，同時山於這次公演所得到的反響，而使他們明白了目前的戲劇座價還太貴族化了，他們務必在可能範圍內，做到更平民化，更普遍化，使人人可以用最低的代價，看到更高貴的戲劇。現在揚子江劇社，在這幾度的會議之下，巳宣告成立了，並巳决定首次公演的劇本，在「蘭姑婚的悲劇」與「偽君子」二劇中任選其一，導演人亦巳定了「欽差大臣」導演之一的沈西苓担任云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Ambassador Arrives in Nanjing for Meeting with Chiang Kai-shek, Discussing Improvement of Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Arisima Inquires About Situation in Hebei, Chiang Claims Appropriate Measures Already in Place</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Arisima, along with two secretaries from the embassy, Horiuchi and Arino, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai via the evening train on the 19th. On the morning of the 20th, accompanied by the two secretaries and Consul-General Suma, they visited President Wang at the Central Hospital to inquire about his health. President Wang received them briefly in his sickbed before they departed. At 5 PM, accompanied by Suma, Horiuchi, and Arino, they visited Chairman Chiang at his official residence. Also present were Zhang Qun, Chairman of Hubei Province, and Tang Yuren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who served as the translator. They exchanged detailed views on how to improve Sino-Japanese relations. Ambassador Arisima inquired about the current situation in Hebei, to which Chairman Chiang replied that the central government had already determined appropriate measures for the situation in Hebei, which would soon be implemented.

<p>(Nanjing) On the 20th, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reported that Japanese military attaché in Nanjing, Amemiya, and Consul-General Suma visited Vice Foreign Minister Tang in succession on the morning of the 19th, discussing the North China autonomy issue, and claiming that Tang had expressed that the central authorities had no intention of using force to suppress it. In order to clarify the truth, this reporter inquired at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Tang replied that Military Attaché Amemiya and Consul Suma came to talk about the atmosphere between China and Japan as the main topic, without mentioning anything about the northern affairs. He only listened to what the other side stated and did not express any opinion. The sections mentioned in the report are completely fictitious. He specially issued a statement, and as for our policy towards Japan, it has been fully elucidated by Chairman Chiang at the Fourth Session of the Fifth National Congress. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Han Fuju, Song Zheyuan, etc. Did Not Confer in Tianjin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure from the Ministry of Military Affairs issued a statement on the evening of the 20th, saying that Han Fuju is still in Jinan, and the central government received a telegram from Han on the 20th, which proves that he did not go to Tianjin. Shang Zhen is still in Baoding, suffering from a cold and coal poisoning, and has been admitted to the Baoding Hospital for treatment.

Outside the hall, there were hundreds of wreaths and memorial banners. At the entrance to the cemetery, pine and cypress branches were woven into decorative arches, with the horizontal inscription "Sacrifice for Righteousness." The couplet read: "Grieve for the suffering of the people, seeing the red flames scorching the sky. In those years, the generals and soldiers were valiant, recovering the old territories after hundreds of battles. They could face death as going home, making revolution for the sake of their principles. This burial ground is lush and verdant, where officials and commoners alike mourn the loyal souls." Entering through the archway, passing through the main gate archway, the ancestral hall, the cemetery, the memorial hall, and finally reaching the memorial tower, national flags were hung along the way. In front of the ancestral hall, tall pine branches formed a decorative pillar. All the arrangements were solemn and dignified, inspiring respect.

Oh, my soldiers, through a hundred battles of hardship, you established righteousness for a thousand autumns. Sacrificing yourselves in an instant, with the courage of champions and the valor of heroes, your blood moistened the fields, and your spirit transformed into a rainbow. Some of you wielded flags and made strategic decisions, determined to fulfill your aspirations. Others were subordinate officers, charging and fighting bravely, rushing forward, their chests pierced and their bodies torn. Inspired by the principles, you risked your lives, your blood dyed blue. You were the guardians of the nation, defending against foreign invasions. Your bodies perished, but your spirits rejoiced. You sleep eternally. The rain fell on your axes and spears, the sound of war drums in the west wind. Remembering your righteous deeds, we mourn your loss. Your achievements shine brightly on the banners, your names are recorded in the books. May your descendants build upon your accomplishments in the future.

The Revolutionary Army rose up and fought diligently. Our comrades faced countless dangers and hardships. Their spirit matched their righteousness, and they vowed to cut through the thorns. They reversed the course of history and restored the sun and the moon, upholding their loyalty and integrity. They dedicated their lives to the Party and the nation, braving life and death. Their spirits returned to the stars, their blood transformed into rainbows. Their noble example will last for eternity. Their hot blood and sincerity will never fade. The six armies shone brightly, their accomplishments firmly established. Looking back on their footsteps, we followed them with swords and spears, sharing their joys and sorrows, unyielding in our determination. Through hundreds of fierce battles, they rectified the era. Their great achievements are inscribed on tripods and monuments. The departed are gone, transformed into cranes and riding the wind. Their comrades' spirits rest here. Therefore, we have built this beautiful cemetery and erected this towering monument to enclose and protect them. The summer houses stand tall and majestic, Mount Zhong is verdant and beautiful, and the Linggu Temple sets a precedent. Pine, cypress, and juniper trees nurture beauty and emit radiance. The bronze camels and decorative pillars protect and support them. The cemetery connects to the Nine Springs, where we yearn to follow you. Your spirits in heaven should be comforted. We mourn and grieve at your tombs, our hearts filled with sorrow. We offer clean sacrifices and shed tears, our clothes soaked with grief. Alas, accept our offering!

<h3 id="e38">The Completion of the Cemetery for Fallen Soldiers <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Yesterday, the capital city held the completion ceremony and service for the Cemetery for Fallen Soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army. From Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to the ministers and high-ranking officials, all attended the memorial service. All members of the Central Committee and representatives from the Fifth National Congress also went to participate. The occasion was grand and fervent, with the entire city eager to witness the model of the martyrs and inspire the reverie of future generations. Its significance is considerable.</p>
<p>The Cemetery for Fallen Soldiers was built with funds allocated by the Central Party Headquarters. Preparations began in 1929, and construction officially started in the spring of 1931. In addition to the cemetery, there are ancillary buildings such as a memorial hall, a memorial tower, and decorative archways. The exterior is extremely magnificent, and the layout is solemn and orderly. Furthermore, its location to the east of the Premier's mausoleum is sufficient to demonstrate unwavering loyalty, enduring beyond life and death. The heroic souls within all returned from campaigns and battles, directly or indirectly under the leadership of the Premier, to express their sincere devotion. Now that the National Revolutionary Army has celebrated its success, the blood and bodies of these people have long since mingled with the yellow earth and disappeared. The martyrs sacrificed themselves for righteousness, not counting their own posthumous recognition. However, the authorities, mindful of their comrades-in-arms, did not want to be alone in enjoying their honor. Therefore, they wanted to create a concrete memorial to mark their eternal memory, which is a rational and necessary step.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have something more to say. The psychology of most citizens is accustomed to weakness and reluctant to be vigorous, and this has not been the case for just a day or two. The way to correct and encourage this lies in using the spirit of the martyrs as a model for the world to emulate. In a time of national darkness and ignorance, the National Revolutionary Army engaged in the work of destruction and purification. The martyrs fought bravely, risking their lives and regarding death as returning home. Their impassioned and heroic spirit can serve as a standard for the time. Although the times have changed today, the existence of this magnificent cemetery in the capital, a place where diverse people gather, will not fail to inspire admiration and longing. Moreover, the interior and exterior of the memorial tower are still filled with stirring words such as the Premier's opening speech and farewell speech at the Whampoa Military Academy. Those who set foot inside can gain inspiration through browsing. Its benefit to people's hearts is not insignificant. From this perspective, the construction of the Cemetery for Fallen Soldiers will not only strengthen the weak and establish courage, inspiring future generations, but also provide solace to the heroic souls and ensure their immortality.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Abyssinian Troops Complete Deployment; Major Battle Imminent on the Northern Front <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Large detachments encircle Italian troops on the flanks; counterattack begins on the southern front at dawn.</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian army's preparations to defend against enemy troops are almost complete. The Emperor has left the capital by plane today. From the current situation, the first major engagement is now taking place in the vicinity of Magaal on the northern front. A column of Abyssinian troops is now advancing towards Sereka, about 100 miles south of Magaal. The number of Abyssinian troops assembled in that area is estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000. The Emperor's hunting chief, Ayal, has launched a vigorous counterattack in the south, between Annal (which the Abyssinian army claims to have recovered on November 16) and Golahei. The battle began at dawn today, and it is reported that the enemy troops have suffered heavy losses. By noon, the Abyssinian army claimed to have recovered the Italian positions. The Abyssinian army is now planning to attack the left flank of the Italian troops near Annal. Lieutenant Colonel Julian, known as the "Harlem Black Eagle," recently resigned from his position in the Emperor's service. Today, he told a Reuters reporter that if the Abyssinian army does not change its strategy, Abyssinia is in danger of being annexed by Italy. The Abyssinian army only has knives and guns, and its commander wants to follow the Emperor's strategy of concentrated attacks, which makes him particularly disheartened. He trained infantrymen to be proficient in new-style crawling guerrilla tactics, and therefore requested guns and ammunition. The Emperor is of good character, and he wishes to serve him wholeheartedly. Since taking office, he has not received a salary. The Emperor ordered his military officials to issue military equipment, but they were negligent and failed to issue it for a long time, so he resigned. The lieutenant colonel also said that he is very concerned about the Abyssinian army, because they are not suitable for tactics that require the use of tanks, airplanes, and machine guns. If they advance in a concentrated manner, they may be annihilated by the Italian army. When the lieutenant colonel met with the Reuters reporter, he had removed his usual resplendent uniform and was only wearing a short shirt and trousers, with a monocle on the bridge of his nose. After leaving the Emperor, the American black in the service of Abyssinia is now only Mr. Roberson from Chicago. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Italian Front on the Northern Front: Italian outposts in the vicinity of Magaal were surrounded by large detachments of Abyssinian troops today, and a bloody battle is imminent. The Abyssinian army is now planning to attack the flanks of the Italian troops from both the east and west in hopes of retaking Magaal. On the other hand, guerrillas are disrupting the Italian army's rear transportation. Although Italian aircraft bombed extensively on Monday, the Abyssinian army is still firmly entrenched in the trenches around Aba Araci and Assangi. Because the main force of the Italian army has been unable to advance towards Lake Assangi today, military operations have effectively come to a standstill again.

<h3 id="e40">Current Status of Sanctions <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>French Reply to Italian Protest, Laval Meets with British Ambassador, German Ambassador Visits the British Foreign Office</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly’s Sanctions Coordination Committee will likely convene soon to discuss whether to include kerosene, coal, steel, iron, etc., on the list of raw materials embargoed to Italy. League of Nations officials believe President Roosevelt will submit a bill to Congress to prohibit the export of the aforementioned raw materials to belligerent nations, as Secretary of State Hull previously made such a declaration. Furthermore, the U.S. government has already implemented export controls on the items proposed for embargo by the Canadian representative to the Sanctions Committee. Additionally, the Argentine government has notified the League of Nations that it will prohibit the export of kerosene to Italy. Although Argentina's kerosene production is not significant, the League of Nations officials are satisfied that Argentina's initiative will improve the prospects for future negotiations. Furthermore, the League of Nations has received notifications from Mexico, Norway, the Netherlands, and many other countries, all stating that they will implement sanctions against Italy before November 18th. The Turkish government has notified that it will implement strict measures starting November 18th. Venezuela has announced that it has implemented the first and second types of sanctions plans. Colombia has announced that the trade agreement between Italy and Colombia will be terminated on November 18th. The chairman of the Sanctions Committee, the Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, and various experts are planning to gather reports from various governments on November 25th for review. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Laval today presented the Italian Ambassador with France's response to Italy's protest against sanctions. It is reported that the wording of the French response is very subtle and does not change its policy. It stated that after the League of Nations declared Italy an aggressor, Article 16 of the Covenant naturally came into effect. France respects its signature and, in addition to participating in the economic and financial measures predetermined in Geneva, cannot take other actions. However, the French government has not abandoned hope of resolving and terminating the Italian-Abyssinian war and the restrictions Italy is subject to due to international sanctions through friendly means. Although the British response has not been sent, it is reported that its form and substance are the same as the French response. The British response is currently being distributed to the 52 members of the League of Nations Sanctions Coordination Committee for review. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval received the Italian Ambassador Cerruti today, personally delivering France's reply to the Italian protest. This reply will be published on Friday and does not contain any new elements. It only explains that since the League of Nations Council and the League of Nations Assembly have clearly identified Italy as an aggressor against Abyssinia, the provisions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should be implemented. France has an obligation to the League of Nations Covenant and must comply with it, but still hopes that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be resolved amicably. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval received the British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps, this morning for consultations. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The German Ambassador to Britain, Herr von Hoesch, recently visited the Foreign Office for consultations. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Goods Shipped to Italy via Bremen Increase</p>
<p>(London) In recent weeks, the amount of goods shipped from Germany to Italy via Bremen has increased by 50%. Large quantities of lumber, coal, automobiles, and aircraft parts are now being shipped to Italy. Goods shipped from Italy to Germany are mostly fruits and agricultural products. The increase in German exports to Italy is undoubtedly largely due to the implementation of financial and economic sanctions against Italy by League of Nations member states. Germany is not a member of the League of Nations and is therefore not obligated to participate in these sanctions. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Argentine government recently notified League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol that it has included kerosene, coal, steel, iron, etc., in the list of raw materials embargoed to Italy. As for the embargo measures on these raw materials, Canada proposed them. The Sanctions Coordination Committee, considering the implementation of this proposal, requires the assistance of some non-member states such as the United States and Germany, so a decision has not yet been made. Now that Argentina has made the decision, it is enough to lead other member states. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Brussels) On the 14th of this month, the government issued an order prohibiting the export of munitions and war materials to Italy. Recently, a supplementary order was issued, prohibiting the transportation of ores, bauxite, metals, metal mixtures, and their waste materials to Italy. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) In order to prevent Italian goods from entering Britain via countries that refuse to participate in sanctions, the government previously decided that goods imported into Britain from those countries must be presented with a certificate of origin. However, after Germany protested, negotiations were held with Germany, which are still in progress. Recently, Britain intends to enter into a general agreement with various producing countries to prohibit the transportation of kerosene to Italy. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Turin) The lawn of Crown Prince Umberto's Racconigi estate, originally used for recreation, has recently been converted into a cornfield to increase agricultural production and resist sanctions. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government today continued to issue regulations on the management of goods exports. At the same time, a campaign to boycott foreign goods has been launched throughout the country. It is reported that more than 150,000 merchants have sworn to support the boycott. Today, archbishops in various places have issued church notices, urging believers to make efforts and sacrifices to resist sanctions. In theaters across the country, actors are urging the audience to fight against sanctions. The Fascist Grand Council announced that December 18th will be the date of the next meeting. This move is different from usual practice, so it is taken very seriously. It can be seen that Mussolini intends to have closer cooperation with the Grand Council than before. The regulations published by the government today prohibit the export of goods that are indispensable to domestic needs, such as the chemicals needed to manufacture explosives. It also stipulates that Italian goods can be exported as usual to countries that do not adopt sanctions, but must comply with the current clearing agreements. However, for countries that adopt sanctions, Italian goods cannot be exported unless foreign merchants have bank accounts in Italy and pay for the goods in advance. As for woolen, cotton, and silk goods, they must first obtain a license from a special national agency before they can be exported. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official circles here indicated today that the League of Nations' sanctions front has cracked. It is reported that some foreign ministers have stated several reservations when accepting the Italian protest. Italian official circles believe that they can negotiate the purchase of various goods, so that the Geneva front cannot be maintained, and thus Italy will not be greatly affected by sanctions. In order to consolidate Italy's financial position, the government has today ordered that the government has the exclusive right to purchase any gold coins abroad. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>No Protection for Trade with Belligerent Nations</p>
<p>San Pedro, California, USA. The extent to which the new U.S. neutrality legislation will be implemented is a mystery of the current situation. The statement issued by Secretary of State Hull today to the Pacific Coast Maritime Federation can be regarded as the current interpretation of the law. The Maritime Federation had resolved yesterday to refuse to sail ships carrying military supplies to war zones unless they were guaranteed by the government. Hull declared, "If the gasoline mentioned by your association is indeed being transported to the Italian side, then the government cannot guarantee the safety of the sailors, because the President has made it clear that any national who voluntarily trades with belligerent nations assumes all risks." The freighter Oregon, because the gasoline it carries is being transported to East Africa, now has no hope of setting sail due to Hull's statement. However, it was later learned that the sailors on the ship had accepted a 50% bonus, and the company had also taken out life insurance for the sailors, so the ship can sail to the Far East tonight.

<p>Former Philippine Governor Delivers Speech: China Awakens Like a Giant from a Dream, Market Development Has Unlimited Prospects</p>
<p>Hot Springs, Texas, USA. The National Foreign Trade Council recently held a meeting here. President Roosevelt sent a letter stating, "The constructive work of creating peace requires a sound and stable economic foundation and free commerce." Today, international trade is not only suffocated by prohibitive tariffs, but also hindered by import quota systems and other restrictions. We cannot take action alone on this issue. We should cooperate with various countries to reduce excessive restrictions and rebuild commercial relations on a fairer basis. Foreign markets must be restored before domestic prosperity can be expected. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Houston. At the annual meeting of the National Foreign Trade Council held here today, former Governor of the Philippines Forbes said that a market with great potential is currently developing in China, but other countries are taking the opportunity to enjoy it. He also said that China is like a giant who has been sleeping for a long time, and is now gradually moving and showing signs of awakening. The agent of the National Bank of Mexico, Mr. Glenn, told the audience about the relationship between silver and Mexican trade, saying that the United States should purchase Mexican silver at the price of purchasing domestic silver, and Mexico, in return, can greatly reduce or exempt import duties on certain American goods, so that both parties can benefit. The President of the Council, Thomas, advocated sending an economic delegation to the Latin American countries within a few months, saying that expanding trade in this area would be very beneficial.

<p>Internal Disagreement</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator King declared today that the United States should bear the moral responsibility of protecting the Philippines. American officials today disagreed on this issue. Most officials said that the U.S. responsibility to the Philippines will end when the Philippines becomes fully independent in 1946. Other officials only agreed with part of King's claim, but said that future circumstances would be extremely important in determining whether the United States sends troops to assist the Philippines. Observers said that the current U.S. is permeated with a spirit of non-intervention, which will naturally oppose this assistance, but as time passes, this public opinion may change. Within ten years after the establishment of the Philippine autonomous government, the United States will be responsible for the Philippines. People here generally believe that the Philippine national defense problem is still in its infancy. The suggestions of the former American Chief of Staff, now the American Military Commissioner to the Philippines, General MacArthur, will most influence the American attitude towards the Philippines after complete independence.

President Roosevelt explained the reason for appointing Mr. Phillips as a representative today, saying that it would allow Mr. Phillips to become familiar with the circumstances of the naval conference and then return home to serve as a liaison for the naval conference.

Republican Congresswoman Rogers personally went to the White House today to protest, saying that the reduction provisions of this treaty will also benefit other countries due to the most-favored-nation clause. As a result, the textile industry in the eastern United States will collapse due to increased competition from Japanese goods. The President of the National Lumber Manufacturers Association, Mr. Compton, also said that the lumber industry is not satisfied with the agreement, so it will study whether the Commercial Treaty Law is in line with the Constitution.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Transportation is launching simple life insurance, which is scheduled to be launched on December 1st by the savings and remittance bureaus in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou. He Zongyan, the manager of the Nanjing Savings and Remittance Bureau, went to Shanghai a few days ago to consult with Director-General Shen Shuyu. According to the discussion, simple life insurance has been implemented in various European countries for some time. Our country is initially establishing it with 500,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Transportation as a fund. Various preparation procedures have already been formulated by the head office. The bureau in Nanjing is responsible for handling this matter. Management bureaus in other locations will begin next March and will not be specially organized. In the future, it is planned to recruit a number of solicitors to solicit insurance policies from outside, and subsidies will be given based on their performance. The scope of insurance is divided into two categories: whole life and term life, with the amount of insurance ranging from 50 yuan to 500 yuan. Anyone over the age of twelve can apply for insurance, and the procedures are simple. Those without bad habits or disabilities can apply for insurance. The premiums collected are only about two-fifths of one percent. Those who take out this life insurance policy will have their premiums suspended within a reasonable range if they become disabled, etc., halfway through, and they will still be able to receive the full amount of the premium when it expires. This simple life insurance is quite suitable for the middle class, and it is expected that business will develop rapidly in the future. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Cheng Jingsheng, the director of investigation and distribution for the Relief Association, arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 20th to investigate the distribution of funds in the disaster area. He is scheduled to go to the Donghai area on the morning of the 21st for investigation.

Nearly 2 million people in the ten counties of Tong, Hai, and Huai are awaiting food. Winter and spring agricultural emergency relief should be carried out in conjunction. The industrial relief has already been burdened with the allocation of 11 million public bonds. However, the funds raised by the provincial charity association for winter and spring agricultural emergency relief are very small and difficult to provide relief. He earnestly requested that at least 3 million yuan in cash be quickly allocated from the 9 million general disaster relief public bonds and the 5 million salary deduction items specifically for winter and spring agricultural emergency relief and various small-scale industrial relief projects to help the people survive.

<p>The Price of Silver Plummets, and Guangxi Banknotes Rise in Value Invisibly. Commercial Exchanges Have Changed to Using Guangxi Banknotes for Transactions</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Since the central government and Guangdong province promulgated currency management measures, silver coins have lost their utility as currency. Silver is purchased by legal currency agencies. All places that usually use silver coins are affected. In Guangxi province, Guangdong silver dollars were commonly used in the past. The value of silver dollars was higher than that of Guangxi province's banknotes. Since Guangdong changed to using silver dollar notes as legal currency, the value of Guangdong silver dollars circulating in Wuzhou, Guangxi province, has fallen sharply. At the same time, the value of Guangxi province banknotes has risen sharply. Previously, 100 Guangdong silver dollars were worth 120 Guangxi banknotes. Since the 7th of this month, they are only worth 107 yuan. As for silver dollars, which were usually worth 140 Guangxi banknotes per 100 yuan, are now only worth 120 yuan. Guangxi merchants, because the central government and Guangdong province abolished silver dollars, have been selling silver dollars in large quantities in recent days, so the financial situation has changed greatly for a time. Merchants who stored silver coins have suffered heavy losses. The salt market and yarn market both suspended trading. The Wuzhou Post Office has also recently taken the central government's legal currency as the standard, and announced that one postal currency equals 1.45 silver dollars, and one postal currency equals 250 copper coins. According to news from Guangdong Bank, although Guangxi has not actually promulgated the whole province's currency control measures, the Guangxi banknotes issued by Guangxi Bank have long been invisibly designated as Guangxi's legal currency. Yesterday, the Guangxi Provincial Government also ordered the Wuzhou Guangxi Bank and the Wuxian County Government to inform the Wuzhou Chamber of Commerce that all silver transactions in the market will be changed to Guangxi banknotes for trading. Furthermore, the silver dollar treasury bonds issued by the Guangxi Provincial Government may also be recalled in the future to unify the legal currency. Therefore, the reform of the currency system in Guangxi Province is proceeding smoothly, but the export of silver from the province cannot but be strictly prohibited. Yesterday, the Guangxi Provincial Government ordered all counties and agencies to completely prohibit the export of silver, silver utensils, and silver ingots from the province. Those who smuggle or harbor smugglers will be punished by death in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. The original order is as follows: "It is hereby noted that our country is a silver standard country. Recently, since the price of silver has risen sharply, silver has been flowing out continuously, financial resources have been exhausted, and industry and commerce have been declining. If this continues without seeking remedies, the consequences will be dire. Recently, the central government resolutely promulgated currency management measures, which is an urgent measure to save the national economic crisis. All provinces have followed the orders after receiving them, and restrictions on the export of silver and all silver goods are strictly enforced. Under the same circumstances in this province, we should quickly plan good policies to preserve the existing silver. All silver and silver utensils such as silver ingots are completely prohibited from being transported out of the province. They are still allowed to circulate within the province. Those who smuggle or harbor smugglers shall be punished by death in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. All county bureaus along the border should strictly investigate and deal with them. If there are any omissions, the county bureau chiefs shall be held responsible. All anti-smuggling, coast guard, and customs police teams must still be responsible for assisting in the investigation to prevent negligence. All should comply with the above and be recorded by each county bureau and chamber of commerce for public notice" (November 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Hubei Province Appeals to the Central Government to Allocate 5 Million for Industrial Relief <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Has Already Allocated 500,000 in Relief Funds</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Hubei Province suffered an unprecedented flood in July, the authorities immediately decided to treat the symptoms with emergency relief and agricultural relief, and treat the root cause with industrial relief. The opinions of the central and local governments are consistent, but because the relief funds are small, the work to treat the root cause is just empty talk. Now, as the weather turns cold and the year ends, the victims are suffering from hunger and cold, and deaths are following one another. If construction is not started again, it may affect public security and cause a major disaster. This is an extremely serious problem that must be addressed. It is noted that the central government has allocated seven batches of relief funds to Hubei Province this year, totaling 10,500 yuan for the first batch, 10,000 yuan for the second batch, 15,000 yuan for the third batch, 5,000 yuan for the fourth batch, 10,000 yuan for the fifth batch, 5,000 yuan for the sixth batch, and 6,000 yuan for the seventh batch, plus 300,000 yuan allocated for disaster relief reserves, totaling 511,500 yuan. In addition, 150,000 yuan was received from the Shanghai fundraising for the inter-provincial flood relief association. Except for the sixth and seventh relief funds and the reserves allocated by the central government, all the funds have been distributed to various counties, but it is still felt that it is not enough. The industrial relief requires even more funds. The provincial government previously requested the central government to allocate 5 million yuan for industrial funds, which was originally the lowest estimate. Now it is heard that the central government can only raise 1 million yuan, which is a huge difference, making it difficult to start construction as scheduled. The provincial government and the Flood Relief General Association specially telegraphed President Wang and Minister Kong yesterday as the most urgent appeal. The provincial government's telegram stated, "To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, We are in receipt of the telegram from the secretariat of the Economic Commission, stating that (1) the Zhongxiang Sisi engineering dam blocking project and breach, (2) the Jianghan main dike, (3) the civil dike and other projects in Hubei Province will require funding, spring [projected amount], which has been approved by this committee, allowing the central and local governments to each bear 1 million yuan, and the remaining 3 million yuan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the Ministry of Finance has been approved to find ways to raise funds. After suffering a catastrophic disaster in this province, the people are in dire straits, and the dikes and embankments have been destroyed. Without allocating huge funds to carry out industrial relief, and using industrial relief to repair the dikes and embankments, there is no way to save the remaining people and relieve the harm. After repeated estimates and reports of the required number of funds, we have explicitly requested that they be raised and allocated quickly. Now, according to the previous reason, the central government will only allow the allocation of 1 million for industrial relief in this province, which is a huge difference from the original estimated number and is really insufficient for distribution. Now the weather is cold, and it is also the time of emergency winter defense. If industrial relief is delayed again, the victims will die of hunger and cold, and it is feared that major changes will occur in the local situation. The situation is extremely urgent. For the sake of disaster relief and security, we can only appeal to increase the allocation according to the number requested in the previous telegram."</p>

<p>, and will allow it to be allocated in advance to facilitate implementation. When issuing disaster relief bonds again, Hubei Province should be allocated a reasonable percentage and the terms should be leniently determined. We are deeply grateful and await your instructions. [Stamped: Hubei Provincial Government]." The Flood Relief Association's telegram stated, "To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, The flood in Hubei Province this year was extraordinarily severe, the dikes and embankments were destroyed, and the people were struggling to save themselves, leaving no strength to repair the breaches. In order to provide relief to the disaster victims and prevent floods in the coming year, this association is planning to take advantage of the dry winter season to repair the civil dikes and use labor as relief. The circumstances of the dike breaches in the various counties have been reported in detail. Now that it is winter, the victims are suffering from hunger and cold. If industrial relief is delayed again, not only the local security is at risk, but the possibility of disasters next year is unimaginable. However, the relief funds raised by this association are extremely small, and the provincial treasury is severely strained and unable to supplement them. A detailed industrial relief plan has been drafted, but it cannot be implemented due to the limited funds. Looking ahead, we are deeply anxious. We have received a telegram from the Economic Commission through the provincial government stating that only 1 million yuan will be allocated for industrial relief in this province, which is a huge difference from the original estimated number and is really insufficient for distribution. We earnestly request that the allocation be made quickly according to the amount requested by this province, so that repairs can be started as soon as possible to save the remaining people and eliminate future troubles.

<p>Divided into First, Second, and Third Classes, Distribution Will Begin Immediately</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Anhui Flood Relief Association believes that during the winter season, it is necessary to actively carry out relief efforts for the flood victims. Based on the disaster reports from various counties, the reports have been submitted for review. Last Saturday, Committee Member Guo entrusted someone to review the disaster reports from Dongliu, Qianshan, Fanchang, Tongling, Guichi, Huaining, Taihu, Tongcheng, Wangjiang, Susong, Zhixian, Wuwei, He County, Wuhu, and Dangtu counties. As a result of the review, except for Wangjiang, Susong, and Zhixian counties, which have already been entrusted to the Shanghai Flood Relief Association to distribute on their behalf, the disaster situation in the other eleven counties of Huai and Tong, except for Qianshan, which was lightly flooded and not considered a disaster, is not included in the list. The disaster-stricken counties are classified according to the size of the breach range, the width of the submerged fields, and the number of disaster-stricken households. The opinions are as follows: (1) In Huaining, Tongcheng, Fanchang, and Tongling counties, more than 40 or 50 breaches have occurred in each district, the population of the disaster-stricken areas ranges from 8,000 or 9,000 to over 30,000 or 40,000, and the flooded fields are over 20,000 or 30,000 mu. They should be listed as first class. (2) In Dangtu, Wuhu, Wuwei, Taihu, and Guichi counties, there are more than 10 breaches in each district, the population of the disaster-stricken areas ranges from tens of thousands to over 30,000, and the flooded fields total more than 40,000 or 50,000 mu. They should be listed as second class. (3) In He County and Dongliu County, there are only three or four breaches in each district, or they are not breaches but flooded by water intrusion, with only six or seven districts. According to the number of affected households and submerged fields listed in the report, although the figures are said to be large on paper, judging from the facts, there are very few breaches in the county. Subtracting the repair of the breach engineering, the losses are small and the disaster is light. They should be listed as third class. The above-listed three classes of counties and districts, the distribution of relief funds should be determined by the general meeting. The fifth standing committee meeting of the association decided to allocate 2,500 yuan to each first-class county, 2,000 yuan to each second-class county, and 1,500 yuan to each third-class county. Personnel will be dispatched to distribute the funds to the respective counties in the near future. (19th)</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In the northeastern townships of Jing County, southern Anhui, since the remnant bandits captured Maolin Village last year, they have been entrenched in the deep mountains of Ding Cao Erxi in the eastern townships, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. They have kidnapped about 100 people and disrupted the area for nearly a year, causing great harm to the people in the northeastern townships. People are wary within a few miles of leaving the northeastern gates of Jing City. A rumor about an attack on the city spread last month, and the chamber of commerce telegraphed the province for reinforcements. The northern townships also sent representatives to the province to petition. On the night of the 10th of this month, during a heavy rain, more than 200 remnant bandits washed and looted Chitan Town, Linhe in the northern townships, burning down more than 20 civilian houses and kidnapping about a dozen people, all of whom were store owners. At that time, Wang, the deputy commander of the security team stationed in the city, led a team to suppress them fiercely. After about four hours, the bandits fled. About thirty or forty people from both sides died. On the evening of the 12th, at 10 PM, Commissioner Zeng of Xuan City, Deputy Commander Long of the Security Forces, and Commander Xu of the Fifth Regiment arrived in Jing and decided to set up a temporary bandit suppression headquarters. Long will be stationed there permanently to command. The next afternoon, Commander Shi of the Eleventh Route Army led more than 300 people from Shi Dai to arrive in the city, and the people's hearts were slightly settled. They will set off in the near future to search and suppress the northeastern townships, vowing to eliminate them before stopping.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Completion of Boundary Demarcation Between Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces, and Establishment of Two New Counties <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of Binjiang County Between Xun and Huang, Jurisdiction Yet to be Determined; Anhui to Establish Yuexi County, Part of Hubei to be Placed Under Its Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The governments of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, previously acting on central government orders, were required to re-demarcate the boundaries of counties in the border regions. They jointly dispatched personnel to Xun to conduct on-site surveys and hold boundary demarcation meetings in Xun. Special attention was paid to facilitating administration and water conservancy construction. This work has now been completed. The Hubei Provincial Boundary Survey Committee has returned to Hubei from Xun to report on its mission. It is reported that, as a result of consultations between the representatives of the three provinces, slight changes were made to the original provincial boundaries. It is proposed to separate the area west of Konglong Town, belonging to Huangmei County, extending east to Chenjiaying, and the Fengyi and Feng'er townships, belonging to Jiujiang in Jiangxi, to establish a new county, to be named Binjiang County. Detailed plans are currently being jointly drafted by the authorities of the three provinces. Which province it will belong to in the future will be determined by the central government. However, this boundary demarcation is of great importance to the management of the Mahua Embankment, which is shared by the three provinces. The embankment traverses the three provinces, making it difficult to coordinate repairs in peacetime and emergency reinforcement in times of crisis, often leading to major disasters. It would be better to place it under the responsibility of one province. As for which province it will belong to in the future, based on the past division of expenses, Hubei Province has borne 56%, Anhui Province 31%, and Jiangxi Province 13%. Therefore, it can be predicted that it will be assigned to Hubei Province. In addition, the borders of Shucheng, Huoshan, Qianshan, and Taihu counties in Anhui province are intricately intertwined with those of Yingshan County in Hubei province. The chairman of Anhui Province, Liu Zhenhua, specially consulted with the chairman of Hubei Province, Zhang Qun, to establish a new county in the overlapping areas of these counties, to be named Yuexi. This has been submitted to the Chairman's Headquarters for approval. The Hubei Provincial Government, considering that part of the county's territory is within its own province, needed to send a senior official to investigate and determine its feasibility. Committee member Fan Xiji was dispatched to conduct an on-site survey and discuss everything with Liu. He deemed it feasible. Today, a telegram was sent from Anhui to the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Lu Zhu, reporting the progress: "Wuchang Provincial Government, Secretary-General Lu Dian Sheng brother, the case of adding a new county in the border area of Ying, Huo, Shu, Qian, and Tai has been properly planned by the Anhui Provincial Government. The part related to Hubei Province only involves a few Bao in the Taojiahe, Xiaojiahe, and Zhanjiahe area of the third district of Ying, which need to be placed under the jurisdiction of the newly established Yuexi County. After investigation, this plan is very unreasonable. From the perspective of terrain, the administrative area is more complete. In terms of public security, Taojiahe is far from Ying and the government's orders are difficult to reach, making it easy for bandits to occupy. Based on the above reasons, I have fully accepted the methods proposed by the Anhui Provincial Government. Furthermore, Anhui Province has been preparing for the establishment of the new county for a long time. At a time when bandits are roaming, in order to save time and quickly achieve success, I am sending the draft presentation and the official document of consultation at the same time to Hubei. Please forward them to the chairman after arrival and submit them for discussion and decision quickly. Brother Fan Xiji bows." (17th)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Ministry of Finance Plans to Establish Silver Depositories in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Silver to be Kept by Branches of the Issuance Reserve Fund Committee; Situation in Wuhan Stabilizes, Market Returns to Normal</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: It has been nearly half a month since Wuhan implemented currency reform according to orders. The disturbances in the market have largely subsided. The two major problems of inevitable stagnation in copper coin redemption and rising commodity prices have now become a thing of the past. Initially, copper coins were hoarded by unscrupulous merchants, but the government repeatedly issued orders, making it difficult to hoard. In addition, the legal exchange rate was set at six strings of copper coins for one legal tender yuan, preventing unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market. The copper coins gradually flowed out and retail trade was able to resume as usual. In order to alleviate the situation in the market, the provincial government decided to issue copper coin notes with a total value of one million strings. However, as the copper coin situation returned to normal, the issue was reduced to one hundred thousand strings, and the printing was agreed upon. However, in the past few days, copper coins have become even looser, and the issuance is planned to be temporarily suspended. As for the commodity price problem, after officials and merchants discussed forming a Commodity Price Evaluation Committee, and after the provincial government, municipal government, and garrison headquarters issued announcements to suppress high prices, the rising trend finally stabilized. Currently, except for daily necessities, which are still higher than before, most other items have fallen to normal prices. Although the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee has not been established, representatives from various agencies have already been appointed, and Wang Kaihua, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Department, has been designated as a standing committee member. Recently, as commodity prices have gradually stabilized, there is also a proposal to temporarily suspend its establishment. Currently, the legal tender issued by the Big Three banks accounts for the majority of currency circulating in Wuhan, with the rest being banknotes issued by various banks. Silver has disappeared. The Big Three banks and various banks have received a total of more than 12.57 million yuan in cash so far. According to financial sources, in order to gain the trust of the people, the Ministry of Finance has decided not to concentrate the cash received in one place, but to establish four major depositories in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, with each branch of the Issuance Reserve Fund Management Committee responsible for safekeeping. The large amount of cash in Wuhan will also be transferred to the branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and will no longer be shipped abroad. It is also reported that since receiving an urgent order from the Ministry of Finance, the Jianghan Customs has prohibited the import and export of cash, so no handover has been received. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Guangdong Province: Demand for Legal Tender Exceeds Supply <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Printing Existing Silver Dollar Notes and Converting Them into Silver Dime Legal Tender; Regulations of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee Passed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangdong Province announced the management of currency and the collection of hard currency with legal tender, depositors of silver dimes in various places have been flocking to the Provincial Bank to exchange silver for legal tender. As a result, the Provincial Bank had received 15 million yuan in silver dimes as of the 14th. The dime notes of legal tender printed by the Provincial Bank are about to be exhausted, so it has had to issue existing silver dollar notes as dime notes of legal tender. In the past few days, it has stamped the printed one-yuan and ten-yuan silver dollar notes with the words "for silver dime note use" and issued them with signatures. The Finance Department has officially announced that the silver dollar notes stamped as silver dime notes by the Provincial Bank are considered legal tender, and should be used in the same way as one-yuan, five-yuan, ten-yuan, and one-hundred-yuan silver dime legal tender, whether for tax collection or market transactions. Furthermore, the Provincial Bank has recently limited the exchange of silver for legal tender, as the demand for silver dime notes exceeds the supply. Those with less than 200 yuan are allowed to exchange for one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan dime notes. Those with 200 to 1,000 yuan can exchange for 100-yuan dime notes. Those with more than 1,000 yuan need to fill out a form and register for exchange. To prevent unscrupulous merchants from buying silver, non-designated silver shops are not allowed to privately collect silver, and violators will be severely punished. As for various cities and towns in the province, they are now buying silver with dime notes. Places such as Jiangmen, Foshan, Shilong, and Chencun have been buying and transporting dime notes to the province for storage in recent days. As for Shantou, which usually uses silver dollars, the Finance Department has specially formulated measures. All official payments in Shantou are settled in dime notes, still calculated by adding 3% to the locality and 2% to the note, plus one yuan for water. The Shantou Branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank has announced the above measures to merchants and residents.</p>
<p>Since the Provincial Bank started buying silver, it has reached 20 million yuan. It will continue to collect silver in the future. There should be a responsible agency for the custody of large sums of reserves. The Provincial Government held a special meeting on the morning of the 13th to discuss the organizational rules of the Guangdong Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Management Committee, which were immediately revised and passed. The original text is as follows: Article 1: The Guangdong Provincial Government specially establishes the Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Committee to consolidate the credit of legal tender.

<p>Lianshui Refugees Pass Through Songjiang Seeking Food</p>
<p>Recently, 132 refugees from Renhang Township, Fourth District, Lianshui County, carrying the old and supporting the young, led by the people's representative Li Hecai, sought food along the way, describing the tragic situation of the famine. They have arrived in the territory of the Third Garrison of this port via Tianmashan. The garrison considered that during the winter defense period, the large number of people was related to public security and did not allow them to stay. After raising funds and providing rations, the group of refugees proceeded towards Fengjing.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Implementation of Compulsory Literacy Education</p>
<p>The case of compulsory literacy education in Wuxi was initiated by Zang Fogen, the former Director of the Education Bureau. According to the latest household registration survey, the total population of the county is more than one million, and it is estimated that half of them, 500,000, are illiterate. Among them, middle-aged illiterate people between the ages of 16 and 45 account for more than 100,000. According to the provincial order, the principle is that at least one person per household should attend school. There are a total of 200,000 households in the county, and 100,000 people must attend school. Assuming 50 students per school, 4,000 schools should be established, to be operated in three phases. Each phase will establish 1,330 schools. According to the Baojia system, each small Bao will set up a civil school or a civil literacy class, and each large Bao will run a civil school or a civil literacy class every two Baos. Divided into three phases, each phase can eliminate illiteracy for 66,600 people. Each school will be subsidized 30 yuan for books and other expenses. The first phase should cost 40,000 yuan. The above plan has been submitted to the Education Department for modification and approval, and the current Director Hui Meishan has been ordered by the County Government to implement it conscientiously. Wu Xilin, Yan Yangdou, and Gu Jingcun have been appointed as members of the public literacy reader review committee to determine the textbooks. The first phase has been decided to be implemented within this month.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>Buying Hard Currency Sent to County for Investigation</p>
<p>Xu Xingzhong, who has been working in a rice shop in Yangshupu, Shanghai, near Huichun Tangerine in Nanmen, returned to Jiading on the 17th. He contacted various shops in the city to exchange legal tender for hard currency. Someone secretly reported him to the Zhouqiao Patrol Station. The police immediately investigated and saw him discussing prices with someone in a meat shop on Dongdajie. They immediately arrested him and sent him to the County Public Security Bureau. They found 211 yuan of legal tender and 9 yuan of hard currency on his person. Under interrogation by Section Chief Zhu, Xu initially denied it, claiming that the silver coins he carried were brought to Shanghai by a neighbor, Wang [omitted]. After investigation, it was found that Wang did not entrust him. It was also learned that Xu had exchanged legal tender for hard currency with Wang Bingyi of Zhenchangqian North-South Goods Store in Nan [omitted], ten [omitted] for hard currency [omitted]. Wang was summoned to confront him. Wang then admitted that he had taken the exchange to Shanghai to make a profit. He also admitted that he had done it before, so someone would come to exchange with him after he went to Shanghai. The Public Security Bureau sent the case to the County Government for judicial investigation along with the suspect Wang.</p>

<p>Xiaobao Promotes Simple Words and Phrases</p>
<p>Wang Zhiyuan, Secretary-General of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, is usually enthusiastic about public education. He promoted literacy campaigns in Guangdong in the past. In 1930, he founded the Qianzi Daily in Shanghai, using simple characters to popularize education, which was very effective. Recently, in order to implement this idea, Wang specially founded Xiaobao in Nanjing, publishing one sheet a day, with a novel format, fast and accurate news, and simple content, encompassing everything. It can be said to be a unique color in the news industry. The newspaper has now been published and sells very well. Readers generally enjoy subscribing to it because its words and phrases are simple. The newspaper uses only 1,500 root characters, which are determined to be the most common in daily life. All complex characters are replaced by root characters, so those who have studied for three months and know more than 1,000 characters can read about world affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Impressions of a Trip to Guangxi (Continued) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>Fifthly, the tragic phenomenon of national subjugation is the most shocking, and it can never be erased. When this reporter arrived in Longzhou, I visited Zhennanguan to see the historical relics of our country's victory over the French. Looking at the past and present, the country is in trouble and foreign enemies are pressing in. It's truly a mix of laughter and tears. This reporter temporarily waited for a passport to go abroad, left Zhennanguan, entered Annam, and arrived at Lang Son, where the Black Flag Army led by Liu Yongfu was stationed. Military victory led to peaceful negotiations, a heartbreaking history, unbearable to recall. Today, the mountains and rivers remain the same, but the scenery is completely different. Everywhere there are small French-style houses, asphalt roads, wide and neat streets, and trees lining the roads. There are trains and highways, and transportation is extremely convenient. The Annamese people certainly enjoy more material civilization than before their subjugation, but spiritually, they have deep scars. This reporter interviewed a middle-class Annamese family. The house was full of old things, and there were also some scattered calligraphy and paintings. Knowing that I was Chinese, they looked very cordial. When I asked about various situations, they just sighed and shook their heads. The so-called "a belly full of bitterness" was all unspoken. I also visited an Annamese primary school, where the main subjects were taught by the French. Half of each week was devoted to French and the other half to Annamese. The Annamese language originally used Chinese characters, and street names and house numbers were also in Chinese characters. Now, the Annamese language is spelled using the French alphabet. In thirty years, there will be no more Chinese characters in Annam. From this one aspect, the rest can be imagined. There's really no need for this reporter to say more.</p>
<p>Sixthly, Guilin's scenery is the best in the world. All the peaks rise uniquely from the local area. The jade bamboo shoots and Yao ginseng stand tall without end, and the mountains are all hollow, with deep, remote, and peculiar caves. In addition, along the Li River, there are many clear streams and dangerous ravines, creating scenery everywhere that is endless to explore. Besides Beijing and Hangzhou, it has a unique style. It's a pity that it hasn't been developed by human efforts, transportation is obstructed, and facilities are inadequate. There are no ancient temples adorning the mountains, making it difficult for tourists to stay in the mountains and take candlelit night tours. The Guilin authorities have planned to make Guilin a cultural tourism area, but there is no definite funding. This reporter believes that a large sum of money should be allocated, or public bonds should be issued, and a specialized organization should be established to engage in the construction of the tourist area. In the famous scenic spots such as Yangshuo and Liangfeng, more villas and hotels should be built to accommodate distant tourists. Guidebooks and other pamphlets should be widely printed. More clean hostels should also be set up in Guilin city. Pavilions and kiosks should be added to the famous mountains, and wine, food, and tea should be served. Guilin suffers from inconvenient transportation. It takes two days to go from Hong Kong to Wuzhou. From Wuzhou, sailing up the Gui River to Guilin, shallow-water electric boats can reach Pingle in about a day during the summer and autumn when the water rises. After September and October, the water becomes shallow and dries up, and electric boats stop running. Only民boats can travel, which takes more than ten days, which is very troublesome. The Guilin authorities are currently rushing to build a highway from Wuzhou to Pingle, which will be open to traffic next spring. The distance between the two places is 400 li, and it can be reached in one day. From Pingle to Guilin, both by water and land, you can arrive in one day. At that time, it will only take three days from Hong Kong to Guilin, which will be much more convenient. European, American, and Japanese countries pay great attention to tourism management, and the construction of tourist areas is regarded as an investment. They use various publicity methods to attract tourists. For example, famous scenic areas in France, Switzerland, and Japan attract an average of millions or even tens of millions of yuan in tourism investment every year. Our country has not paid attention to this. If the Guilin authorities can invest a little, I am convinced that the annual profit will be better than any other undertaking. Moreover, the prosperity of the market and the promotion of education and culture will be additional side income.</p>
<p>Seventhly, why the capital of Guangxi province is located in Nanning is truly a big question. Historically, since the Ming Dynasty, the capital of Guangxi province has been located in Guilin. In the early years of the Republic of China, because Lu Rongting was from Wuming, about forty or fifty li from Nanning, a general trend of followers advocated moving the provincial capital to Nanning. At the same time, the highway from Nanning to Wuming was built, which was the beginning of the Guangxi highway. But Nanning, in any aspect, does not have the qualifications to be a provincial capital. It has no strengths in landscape or cultural relics. You can't find a place to visit or stay in the whole city. When this reporter was in Nanning, I raised this question and discussed it with them. Those who advocated that the provincial capital be located in Nanning had two major reasons. The first is that the population in southern Guangxi is sparse, all industries are declining, and it is close to the border defense, which is extremely important. If the provincial capital is too far away, it will be difficult to manage the border areas. Nanning is located in the south and is especially close to Longzhou. On the one hand, it can encourage immigration, and at the same time, it can prevent the border defense from being abandoned. The second is that Nanning has been the provincial capital for a long time, and various constructions have taken shape. Once it is moved elsewhere, the material loss will be too great and outweigh the gains. But in this reporter's opinion, precisely because Nanning is too close to the border, it should not be made the provincial capital. If there is an alarm on the border, Longzhou is only 640 li from Nanning, and the enemy can drive straight in, endangering the political center of the two provinces. Therefore, from a military point of view, the provincial capital should be moved to a farther location. As for material losses, it is even less of a problem. Even if Nanning is not the provincial capital, it can still be a major town in the south in terms of commerce. Various constructions are also needed. There is also a point that is most crucial. The area near Nanning is a plain, with no mountains or rivers to visit. Civil servants feel lonely and unhappy in their spare time. Gambling is strictly prohibited, and there is no place to visit, so it becomes boring. Especially for people from other provinces who come to Guangxi to work, after half a year or a year, they are eager to leave, holding the idea of ​​leaving early. Guangxi province relies heavily on talents from other provinces for various undertakings. If talents cannot stay for a long time, it will naturally affect the development of the cause. Therefore, in terms of climate, geography, culture, and scenery, Guilin is the most suitable place to be the capital of Guangxi province. At the same time, the construction of the Guilin tourist area will also be easier to achieve with half the effort due to the political center. The next best choice is Liuzhou. Liuzhou is backed by mountains and faces water, with a majestic terrain, located in the central part of Guangxi, in the middle reaches of the Liujiang River. To the southeast, it goes down to Xiangxun to the Xijiang River, and to the northwest, it goes up the Honghe River to Guizhou. To the south, it connects to Yonglong, and to the north, it goes out of Guiquan. It really has the advantage of controlling the whole province. However, the construction of the provincial capital takes time and money, which is not as good as Guilin's existing scale. Today, the enemy's military aggression starts with air force bombing. Aircraft carriers sail to Qinzhou Bay, which is more than 200 li from Nanning. They can fly back and forth in one hour. In case of an accident, the political center, the place where orders are issued, will be in danger of serious threats. If it is changed to Guilin, it will be about 1,300 li from the coast, which is relatively defensive. This is even more reason to move the provincial capital in terms of foreign relations. Of course, there are not a few people in the ruling authorities of Guangxi province who advocate and support moving the provincial capital, but the military leaders Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi happen to be from Guilin, so they have to avoid the meaning of supporting their hometown and do not express their views. But for the future development of Guangxi province, it is best to move the provincial capital to Guilin.</p>
<p>Eighthly, Guangxi province has been working hard on construction in recent years, and its political achievements are outstanding. The cooperation between the military and the people and the diligent and honest spirit of officials are truly commendable. But there is a point that the Guangxi authorities should pay special attention to, which is the training of middle and lower-level cadres. The leaders of Guangxi province have embraced the attitude of setting an example in governing military and political affairs, so everything is being revived and the achievements are remarkable. However, most of the middle and lower-level cadres under the leaders either do not understand the true doctrine or have a sense of obedience but no creativity. They follow the example and do not know why. The foundation does not seem to be very solid. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to the training of cadre talents, so that the people who work below can thoroughly understand the purpose of the administration, not working for others, but serving for the cause. Then, send the trained cadre talents to the people to train the masses, so that all the people in the province have a sense of self-government and a sense of service, and the achievements of Guangxi's governance can be maintained permanently and continue to progress forever. The lack of understanding of middle and lower-level cadre talents can be proven by many examples. The most obvious is the change of clothing. Many people in Guangxi province, of course, wear gray cloth uniforms as ordered, but after leaving Guangxi province, they change into neat suits and look different. When they come back, they change back into cloth clothes. Even the problem of clothing is so artificial. Of course, they do not understand the cloth clothing doctrine advocated by their leaders. By analogy, it is undeniable that they do not have a sufficient understanding of the main point. (End)</p>

According to those around him, Huang Fu went to Beijing at the invitation of the Central Government to provide consultation and contribute his personal opinions. He had no other mission. Because he had many visits with important people in Beijing, his energy was exhausted, and his nasal illness recurred. His left nostril also felt uncomfortable. After returning to Shanghai, he will stay in Shanghai for a rest to recover. It has not yet been decided whether he will return to Mogan Mountain. He does not intend to go anywhere else.

<h3 id="e88">The Ministry of Communications to Expand Coastal Radio Stations <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The original scope is small, and there is a plan to move to Wusong.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Communications coastal radio stations are dedicated to facilitating marine communications, and have unique functions for ship safety and maritime audio information. In recent years, with the development of various industries, the need for coastal radio stations has been increasing day by day. The Ministry of Communications believes that the original radio stations are insufficient and has instructed them to expand. The office of the radio station was originally located at the Hongqiao Radio Station, while the radio station itself was located at Fenglin Bridge. Because the original scope is small, and expansion is limited by land issues, it is currently being planned. The former International Telecommunications Bureau once built a large-scale broadcasting station in Wusong. After this project was canceled midway, the land in Wusong is quite large, so there is talk of moving the radio station to Wusong.</p>

<p>Will be buried in the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen on January 3rd next year.</p>
<p>The late General Fan Hongxian, who died for his country, was temporarily buried in Shanghai in the third year of the Republic of China. The Central Government, in commemoration of his past merits, issued an order to commend him and posthumously conferred him the rank of General, and had him buried in the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen to show the nation's respect for loyalty and martyrdom. It appointed committee members Li Zhengqiu and others to prepare the funeral. The funeral date was set for January 3rd next year. Li and others came to Shanghai the night before yesterday and decided to transport the coffin to Beijing tomorrow (22nd). Details are listed below.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Fan Hongxian</p>
<p>Martyr Fan Hongxian, also known as Guangqi, was from Hefei County, Anhui Province. He was fond of learning from a young age and was known in the world for his writing. Before the Xinhai Revolution, he and Song Jiaoren, Yu Youren and others advocated revolution with their writing. At that time, literati from home and abroad responded to him. When he was in charge of the People’s Voice, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen once said to Fan Hongxian, "Your pen can sweep away hundreds of thousands of soldiers." Fan Hongxian’s contribution to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty was significant. In the first year of the Republic of China, he served in the Iron Blood Army. His contribution to the Battle of Nanjing was especially great. When the North and South reached an agreement, he retired to Shanghai and wrote articles to rectify his comrades. When Yuan Shikai stole the country, Fan Hongxian, in order to fulfill his original revolutionary intention, launched another uprising to denounce and punish him, repeatedly defeating the bandits and pacifying Jianghuai. After the GuiChou Incident, he was ordered by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen to co-lead the Shanghai Revolutionary Military with Chen Qimei. Yuan Shikai was afraid of his name and increased the intensity of his capture. In the third year of the Republic of China, he was assassinated by Ren Suo and died for his country. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the capital was established in Nanjing. The Central Government, in commemoration of the martyr’s past merits, appointed Zhang Jingjiang and others to submit a special proposal to the Central Government, issued an order to commend him, posthumously conferred him the rank of General, and had him buried in the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, and ordered the formation of a funeral preparation committee to be responsible for handling the funeral to show loyalty and martyrdom, and increased the funeral expenses. His life deeds were submitted to the Party History. Committee members Wu Zhijing, Jin Weixi, Liu Wendian, Li Zhengqiu, Zhang Gongchen, Wang Juemin, Yin Zhilu, Xuan Yujie, Wei Lihuang, Fan Xuejun, and others were appointed as funeral preparation committee members. After a long period of preparation, they were able to complete the task and decided to welcome the spirit to Beijing for burial tomorrow to show the loyal soul.</p>
<p>The Coffin Moves to Beijing</p>
<p>The special commissioner for welcoming the coffin came to Shanghai the night before yesterday and decided to hold the coffin raising ceremony at the Anhui Funeral Home in Rihui Port at 1:00 PM tomorrow. A public memorial service will be held at the North Station at 4:00 PM, and the coffin will be moved to Beijing. Li and others specially hosted a reception for people from all walks of life at the Youth Association Building on Baxianqiao at 6:00 PM last night, including Fan Hongxian's old friends Xu Shiying, Ding Fubao, Guan Yunnong, Gao Jitang, Li Yuanzhu, and party, government, and military representatives Tong Hangbai (representing Huang E), Li Dachao, Wang Zhinan, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers. Li Zhengqiu presided over the meeting and reported on the progress of the funeral preparations. Gong Zhenpeng reported on Martyr Fan's life deeds. The meeting ended at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Funeral Preparations</p>
<p>Li Zhengqiu reported on the funeral preparations, saying that Mr. Fan Hongxian, a martyr from Anhui, was assassinated in Shanghai in the third year of the Republic of China by Yuan Shikai's agents. His coffin was temporarily placed in Shanghai and has not been properly buried to this day. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Central Government issued an order to commend him, citing the example of Martyr Liao Zhongkai, and had him buried in the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, allocated funeral expenses, and built a tomb. His life deeds were submitted to the Party History. At the same time, Wu Zhijing, Jin Weixi, Liu Wendian, Zhang Gongchen, Wang Juemin, Yin Zhilu, Xuan Yujie, Tan Shanwu, Wei Lihuang, Li Zhengqiu, Fan Xuejun, and other comrades were appointed as members of the funeral preparation committee and established a funeral preparation committee in Nanjing to carry out preparations. The Central Government was requested to demarcate the address in the eastern area of the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen. The land had beautiful mountains, rivers, forests, and excellent scenery. Chen Zhulin, a famous architect from Shanghai, and Yin Zhilu, an engineer from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, were hired to design the building, including the tomb hall and pavilion. Inscriptions and memoirs were written by famous party and state figures. Construction began, and it took several years to complete. It is magnificent, quiet and beautiful, and祭Enjoy and commemoration are sufficient to encourage future generations. A meeting was held on the 17th of this month and resolved: (1) The burial date will be January 3, 1936. The date of welcoming the spirit will be this month's 22nd. Zhang Gongchen, Yin Zhilu, and Li Zhengqiu, members of the preparatory committee, were publicly nominated as special commissioners to welcome the coffin to Shanghai. (2) Welcoming the spirit to Beijing should be divided into four groups: general affairs, document, reception, and ceremony, each responsible for its duties. Jin Mengkui, Gong Jinyi, and Zhao Huasan were appointed to the general affairs group; Zhao Zishu, Shi Keshi, Hong Guannan, Li Shanchou, and Jiang Lisheng to the document group; Chen Baozhi, Han Chuangzhi, and Ni Damin to the reception group; Xiao Qin and Chen Yin'nan to the ceremony group. (3) The Central Government was requested to notify the party and government agencies in Beijing and Shanghai to send personnel to participate in the coffin raising ceremony, the welcoming of the spirit, and the memorial service, and the Ministry of Railways to prepare a train to transport the spirit. (4) The Martyrs' Shrine of the First Park in Nanjing was used as the place to stop the spirit. (5) Committee member Jin Weixi and Committee member Wang Juemin were publicly elected to take charge of the welcoming affairs in Nanjing, and Wu Zhijing to take charge of accounting affairs. The coffin raising ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Anhui Funeral Home in Rihui Port (south of Panjia Wooden Bridge at the end of Jin Shenfu Road) at 1:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. At 4:00 PM, a public memorial service will be held at the North Station. After the memorial service, the spirit will be transported to Beijing. The departure route has been separately announced by this association in the newspaper. The comrades were dispatched to Shanghai yesterday and only had three days to prepare. In such a short time, it was so grand.</p>
<p>Party and Government Notice</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, in order to mourn Mr. Fan Hongxian's loyal deeds, have issued a notice to all agencies and groups in the city to send representatives to participate in the funeral and public memorial service.

<h3 id="e91">Anti-Smoking Propaganda Scheduled for Ten Days Starting Yesterday <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Committee releases pamphlets for smokers to pay attention to.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the anti-smoking work in the city has been actively carried out since the establishment of the Anti-Smoking Committee. Recently, the committee has entered the period of compulsory registration for anti-smoking, so on the 17th, it held an open-air lecture with the Public Security Bureau to persuade smokers to surrender as soon as possible to avoid arrest and severe punishment. The committee believes that it is still necessary to continue to hold official propaganda to expand its reach. Therefore, it has reorganized the propaganda team and set off on different routes to give lectures starting yesterday (20th), while distributing pamphlets to promote smokers' awareness. It is reported that the committee has decided to set a period of ten days. The propaganda locations are: Nanshi on the first day, Pudong on the second day, Xinzha on the third day, North Station on the fourth day, West Gate on the fifth day, Jiangwan on the sixth day, Old North Gate on the seventh day, Huxi on the eighth day, Gaoqiao on the ninth day, and Zhenru on the tenth day. The pamphlet "Smokers' Attention" issued by the committee is attached below. It is hoped that smokers in the city will pay attention: "The anti-smoking work has now shifted from voluntary registration to compulsory registration. However, according to the Public Security Bureau's report, as of now, only 27,000 to 8,000 smokers have registered. However, the city has a large population, and there are definitely more than this number of smokers. As it looks, there are still many, many smokers who have not registered. Originally, during this compulsory registration period, the committee would urge the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and arrest those who have not registered and impose a fine of 50 yuan to 300 yuan in accordance with the law, and then order them to register. There is no possibility of voluntary registration. But among these unregistered smokers, there are undoubtedly some who are cunning and play tricks, but there are also many who are ignorant and foolish. Therefore, the Municipal Government is giving you smokers another way to rehabilitate, a flexible approach that allows you to surrender during this compulsory registration period. All smokers who have not registered can go to the city's Public Security Bureau or its subordinate branches to request registration within the recent period, and they will still be treated the same as voluntary registration and will not be punished. Also, those who want to quit smoking for free can also rest assured and quickly register. This opportunity is running out of time. You smokers must not make another mistake. If you still want to try to evade and delay your surrender, you will be punished in accordance with the law when the Public Security Bureau finds out or is reported by someone, and you will not be tolerated. The above-mentioned method of allowing surrender has been announced by the Public Security Bureau. The committee is sincerely afraid that you smokers will still overlook it, so it has specially reorganized the propaganda team to publicize it as much as possible and distribute this leaflet to make you all aware of this method and the harm of further delay, so as to avoid the government regretting punishing without teaching. It is hoped that you smokers will appreciate the committee's painstaking efforts, abide by the government's laws, quickly turn over a new leaf, and surrender and register. Do not test the law with your own bodies and regret it! Also, those of you who sell private opium, open smoking dens, and use licenses to allow people to smoke, should quickly become aware and find other legitimate businesses, because now the government, in order to completely ban the conversion, has made this law very strict. From today onwards, the city's Public Security Bureau has been supervising its subordinate branches to conduct strict searches. Once discovered, they will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters and punished according to military law, and will not be lenient at all. It is hoped that you will not seek these small profits and suffer severe punishments. This is also the committee's very sincere advice to you. It is hoped that you will pay special attention.

<h3 id="e92">Establishment of a Hospital for Quitting Smoking Plan <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>A Document Submitted to the Municipal Government by Two Bureaus</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reports: The Public Security and Public Health Bureaus are working extremely hard on the matter of establishing a hospital for quitting smoking. They are currently jointly submitting a document to the municipal government. The detailed plan for establishing the hospital is recorded below. The case is based on Instruction No. 3387 from your office, stating that according to a report from the Public Security Bureau, the number of arrested smokers has increased during the period of mandatory registration. All existing hospitals for quitting smoking are unable to accommodate them. Please instruct the Public Health Bureau to jointly prepare and report on the establishment of a temporary hospital capable of accommodating 500 people. Having received this instruction, this bureau found that there are over 4,000 people who have voluntarily requested to quit smoking to the Public Security Bureau. Apart from the 1,738 people who have already been sent for treatment, there are still over 2,000 people waiting to be sent. In addition, with the current mandatory registration, dozens of people are being ordered to quit smoking every day. Apart from the 50 beds that have already been added to the existing Shanghai North Quitting Smoking Hospital by this Public Health Bureau using existing funds, which has been reported in a separate document, the establishment of a temporary hospital with 500 beds is indeed necessary to meet the urgent need. However, opening a hospital with 500 beds will inevitably require considerable housing. After joint discussion, it was found that only the houses in the Gaoging Temple Memorial Village are suitable for renovation and use. According to preliminary estimates, the renovation cost will be approximately 5,830 yuan, and the cost of connecting water and electricity will be 3,300 yuan. However, the houses in the Memorial Village are the property of the Shanghai Municipal Local Association. It is now proposed to borrow them for a short period. Please request the Local Association to transfer a portion of the houses that were previously borrowed from the Association by the Social Bureau to be temporarily allocated for our use. They will be returned after the hospital is closed. The duration of the temporary hospital's existence is estimated to be about three to four months, based on the number of smokers registered by the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the treatment for temporary staff must be appropriately increased to encourage diligent service. To save expenses, it is proposed to request the allocation of the iron beds currently stored in the Municipal Sports Ground for use. This will reduce the purchase cost by 20,344 yuan. The cost of medical equipment and medicines will also be reduced by finding ways to transfer existing supplies, requiring only an opening cost of 2,000 yuan. Therefore, the total opening cost is only 21,474 yuan. Moreover, due to the remote location, security must be taken seriously. It is proposed that the Public Security Bureau allocate a squad from the Police Corps to be stationed permanently to ensure safety and to encourage those undergoing treatment to engage in light gardening work to exercise and benefit their physical and mental health. The total monthly operating expense is 11,446 yuan. The above requirements are intended to be as economical as possible, with no room for further savings. If approved, we will begin preparations immediately to facilitate smoking cessation. We hereby submit a detailed budget for your review and approval. Please grant the allocation quickly, so that preparations can be completed within the month and the hospital can be opened as soon as possible for the public good. Respectfully submitted by Mayor Wu.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Inauguration of the National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Another Management Committee Will Be Formed to Supervise Production and Sales; Branch Sales Offices Will Be Established in Various Locations for Local Distribution</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports: The National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau, supervised by the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, was officially established in Shanghai yesterday. The Management Committee convened at noon to discuss its progress. It is planned to manufacture two million flags by the end of the year for nationwide display on New Year's Day. The opening date is yet to be determined. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Established Yesterday</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, to coordinate the management of the national flag, previously solicited bids from merchants to manufacture the national flag. After investigation and review, the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and the China Flag Manufacturing Company were selected as the manufacturers. Representatives from the two companies were convened in Beijing for a meeting, where it was decided that the two companies would jointly establish the National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau. The organizational outline has been approved by the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, and special commissioners have been appointed to supervise and guide it. The bureau is located at No. 30 Jiyi Lane, Nanjing Road. Yesterday marked the bureau's establishment. The Central Propaganda Department sent Liu Derong, and the Ministry of Interior sent Li An to Shanghai to guide all matters. A first Management Committee meeting was held yesterday afternoon to draft various procedures and set a date for the opening. It was also decided to manufacture two million flags of ten different sizes and styles by the end of the year, all in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the central government. The flags must also be stamped to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>Organizational Outline</p>
<p>Article 1 of the National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau's organizational outline states that the bureau is organized by the national flag manufacturing shops permitted by the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior. The currently permitted manufacturing shops are the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and the China Flag Manufacturing Company. Article 2 states that the two companies organizing the bureau in the previous article are independent of each other internally. If a company is unwilling or unable to manufacture and withdraws from the bureau, the other manufacturer must continue to operate. Article 3 states that the bureau is under the guidance and supervision of the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior. Each company shall appoint three representatives to form a Management Committee to oversee all manufacturing and sales matters. Article 4 states that the Management Committee shall establish two standing committee members to handle daily affairs, who shall be mutually elected by the committee. Article 5 states that the bureau shall establish four sections: General Affairs, Design, Manufacturing Verification, and Distribution, each with a director and several staff members, who shall be responsible for their respective tasks under the direction of the standing committee members. The staff of each section shall be appointed or hired by the Management Committee. Article 6 states that the bureau may appoint technicians as deemed appropriate by the Management Committee to improve flag manufacturing technology and to be responsible for technical design and research. Article 7 states that in order to facilitate guidance and supervision of all bureau activities, the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior shall each send a commissioner to the bureau to handle affairs. Article 8 states that the Management Committee shall meet at least once a month. In the event of a tie vote, the decision shall be made by the supervising commissioner sent by the central government. Article 9 states that all expenses of the bureau shall be borne equally by the two companies. Article 10 states that the bureau shall be located in Shanghai and may establish branch sales offices in various provinces, cities, and counties for local distribution. Article 11 states that this outline shall be implemented upon approval by the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Conversation with Wang Yingbin, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Progress of Cotton Industry Promotion in Zhejiang Province (Continued)</p>
<p>Estimated Quantity of Seed Purchase</p>
<p>Practically speaking, we only need to take the quantity of improved seed cotton already collected at the flower collection stations in each implementation area to understand everything. For clarity, we can provide a statistical overview of the quantity already purchased, the estimated quantity, and the quantity yet to be collected.</p>
<p>Area: Quantity Already Purchased Estimated Quantity Not Yet Collected</p>
<p>Shan: 55,867 catties 600,000 catties</p>
<p>Dinghai: 75,300 catties</p>
<p>Hang County: 132,160 catties 10,000 catties</p>
<p>Zhenhai: 2,775,000 catties 407,880 catties</p>
<p>Cixi: 1,574,30 catties 196,780 catties</p>
<p>Haiyan: 167,919 catties 60,000 catties</p>
<p>Yin County: 2,990 catties 22,000 catties</p>
<p>Yuyao Seed Cotton Lint Cotton 1,210,584 catties 10,144 catties 800,000 catties</p>
<p>Improved Cotton Seeds are of Excellent Quality</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also said that the improved cotton produced in each improved cotton industry implementation area has been analyzed in detail, and its quality is excellent, and the fiber is long. This office sent the improved cotton from Dinghai and the local cotton from the surrounding areas to the Agricultural Crop Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry for inspection. According to the inspection results, the improved American cotton seeds can spin 30-count yarn, while the local cotton seeds can only spin 14-count coarse yarn. This clearly demonstrates that the improved cotton seeds are superior to the local cotton. Other areas' improved cotton is undoubtedly superior to local cotton. We have now instructed each area to send improved cotton to the bureau for separate inspections.</p>
<p>Funds Raised by Various Districts for Flower Collection</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also said that in the early years, for the cotton production of each implementation area, the government originally intended to raise huge sums of money to establish factories jointly by various cooperative societies to centrally collect and sell all cotton. At that time, an operating plan and budget were already drafted and sent to Director Zeng for approval. The total funds required amounted to 1.5 million yuan, and it was decided to borrow from the China Construction Banking Group in Shanghai. I was tasked with contacting the relevant authorities at various banks for consultation, but due to the silver problem at the time, credit was extremely tight, and the loan was not successful. As a result, we had to change our approach. Since the necessary funds could not be borrowed successfully, the plan to establish factories for centralized collection and sales could not be realized. Instead, we reduced the scope and proceeded separately in each area, so that the flower collection could continue. Each district borrowed money to purchase the cotton produced.

<p>Schools Have Submitted More Than 23,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipality's Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief, to plead on behalf of the disaster victims in various regions and increase donations for relief purposes, specifically consulted with the Shanghai Chinese Boy Scout Council to organize a city-wide Boy Scout mobilization for fundraising for a total of nine days. The results were more impressive than previous fundraising efforts. This is not only due to the diligent efforts of the Boy Scout troops but also due to the enthusiasm of all sectors of society. It is learned that this fundraising effort has already concluded. As of yesterday, the troops have submitted approximately 23,000 yuan. The Tongyi, Aiguo, Mailun, Shanghai Girls' High School, Xuhui, Poor Children, Nanyang, and Minzhi schools all achieved results of more than 700 yuan. The Bide, Liangjiang, Southeast, Minsheng, Hean, and Fudan schools have submitted donations but have not submitted the troop member performance report forms, and the procedures are incomplete. The Wanzhu, Shangzhong, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Troop, Juvenile Virtue Learning Association, and Minli Girls' High School, among a total of nineteen troops, have not yet submitted their results. According to Mr. Luo Lie of the Boy Scout Council, everything is now complete. Once the troop performance report forms and donations are submitted together, the detailed figures can be announced.

<p>Letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China received a letter from the South Vietnam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: Greetings. Our chamber has an existing organization for the National Goods Exhibition Hall, located on the upper floor of the chamber, which is spacious and well-suited for displaying goods. However, the samples are incomplete, and due to years of decay, new-style samples have not been collected for expansion. Recently, because the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a National Goods Exhibition, we specifically requested to borrow goods nearby and transfer them to Vietnam for exhibition. The chamber generously sent a complete set of samples, and Mr. Wang Zhisheng and others from the Shanghai Manufacturers' Delegation brought many boxes of goods from Singapore. The goods exhibition opened on the 7th of this month. The exhibition period is scheduled for one week. In recent days, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese have visited, which is sufficient to awaken people's hearts and revitalize national goods. As the closing date approaches, the goods from the Shanghai manufacturers must be packed and returned to Shanghai, and the complete set of samples borrowed from the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce should also be returned. Overseas Chinese who have not had the opportunity to visit are inevitably disappointed. In order to renovate the existing National Goods Exhibition Hall, we have requested your chamber to collect a complete set of samples for long-term display. Now that Mr. Wang Zhisheng is returning to Shanghai, we are sending this letter. If you agree, please contact Mr. Wang Zhisheng to discuss shipping and distribution matters. This matter concerns the future of national goods, and we trust you will be happy to assist.</p>
<h3 id="e98">A Glimpse into the Prosperity and Decline of the Yangtze River Shipping Industry <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Both Cargo and Passenger Traffic on the Yangtze River Decline; Ten More New Ships Added to the Sichuan Route</p>
<p>Recently, the Yangtze River shipping industry has experienced changes. Both cargo and passenger traffic have decreased. However, on the Sichuan route, a large number of new ships have been added. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Cessation of Grain Transport</p>
<p>The transport of miscellaneous grains from Jiujiang and Hankou to Shanghai is the largest source of cargo for various ports along the Yangtze River. Starting from the 15th of this month, a certain number of Shanghai grain and miscellaneous goods businesses suddenly telegraphed Xun and Han ports, instructing them to stop transporting purchased grains to Shanghai. Jiujiang, Hankou, and other ports have not shipped grains since last Friday, causing a significant reduction in imported goods arriving in Shanghai on the Yangtze River downriver ships of various companies in recent days. Even the ships traveling to Nanhua and other places have suffered related losses. Transportation is slow, and business is declining.</p>
<p>Passenger Traffic Declines</p>
<p>All nine of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ships, except for the Jiangjing, still operate under the revenue guarantee system for business directors. The China Merchants ships have always focused on passenger traffic, so the Jianghua, Jiangshun, Jiang'an, and Jiangxin ships are all listed as first-class ships. Recently, passenger traffic on all Yangtze River ports, both upriver and downriver, has declined to an extreme degree. Because of the revenue guarantee system within the company, it is not responsible for the success or failure of passenger ticket sales. Consequently, the business directors of each Yangtze River ship have suffered significant losses due to the slow business, making it difficult to sustain. As a result of collective discussions, all of the business directors of the Yangtze River ships have jointly submitted a request to the head office to reduce the monthly revenue guarantee fee, based on the current period, by one hundred.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Gao Tingzi, Director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, is inspecting the Yangtze River shipping industry to revive the national shipping industry. Therefore, on the 15th, he first went to the Nanjing branch of the China Merchants Bureau to inspect and give instructions, and then went to Wuhu for inspection. This station received a telegram yesterday that Director Gao had taken the Jiangxin ship to Anqing to inspect the shipping administration in central Anhui. He is scheduled to transfer to the Jiang'an ship today to go to Jiujiang, pass through Hankou, and go to Shashi and Yichang to thoroughly investigate the status of the Yangtze River shipping industry in its entirety to provide a basis for planning the revival of the national shipping industry on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Significant Increase in Sichuan Ships</p>
<p>This autumn, the Sichuan River ships' business is better than usual. The income of each ship at its highest level is about twelve to fifteen times higher, which is rarely seen. The profits of the Minsheng Company are especially huge, and the cost of purchasing the Jijiang ships has already been recovered. Now, due to the scarcity of ships caused by the abundance of goods and the soaring shipping fees, the company is urgently adding and purchasing eight new ships for expansion. The following can be launched and operated by the end of this month: (1) The Minxing ship, which is being built by the Hexing Shipyard; and the following will be completed by the end of the year: (2) The Minyun ship and (3) the Xinminkang ship, both built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. In addition, (4) the Minxi ship, (5) the Minlai ship, (6) the Minsu ship, (7) the Minshi ship, and (8) the Minting ship are also being rushed to be launched from the dock and operated within these four to five months. Furthermore, the Mintai and Minju ships will be converted into barges dedicated to transporting tung oil and miscellaneous goods. After this, the number of Minsheng ships operating on the Sichuan River will reach more than fifty. The number of ships suddenly increased by sixteen or seventeen in the autumn and winter of this year. The situation created is indeed unexpected. According to people in the shipping industry, if the China Merchants Bureau had purchased the Jijiang ships at that time and operated them until today, the shipping fees would have already earned about four million yuan.</p>

<p>Dutch Sugar in the Chinese Market</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies authorities believe that the Chinese sugar market is being affected by the dumping of Japanese sugar and the restrictions of the Guangdong Province sugar industry control. If a detailed investigation and rectification are not carried out, the future is in danger. Therefore, they have specially sent Gao, a consultant from the Farmers Bureau, and Tilale, accompanied by Wen Xihuang, to China on the Dutch ship Zhinijiara. At the same time, Fei Xiu, the general manager of the Dutch Sugar Company, was separately sent to China via Japan, carrying an exhibition of Dutch East Indies sugar products in China. It is reported that Tilale and others are currently inspecting the sugar industry in Guangdong, Shantou, and Xiamen, and will then come to Shanghai for inspection. Mr. Fei Xiu, however, will arrive in Shanghai today from Japan on the Shanghai Maru. Tilale and others will also come to Shanghai within two or three days.</p>

<p>Those Who Have Paid May Also Receive a Refund Upon Presentation of a Voucher</p>
<p>Due to the rumors and fluctuations on the Hua Shang Yarn and Cloth Exchange the other day, the standard yarn flower rose and fell sharply, and the transaction volume was too large. In order to maintain trading, a special margin was uniformly increased for the standard yarn flower to show restriction. Since the Municipal Authority refuted the rumors with certainty, the rumors have stopped, the people's hearts have been stabilized, and the yarn flower market has gradually calmed down. Therefore, the Exchange announced that from yesterday onwards, the increase in the cash margin for special evidence will be completely cancelled, and the paid margin will be refunded upon presentation of a voucher.</p>

<p>Claims it is a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Riri News Agency reports: The Hong Kong telegram on the 20th claimed that Japanese residents in Guangdong were ordered by the Japanese government to close their businesses and return home with their families.

The embassy authorities have not received a report from the Guangdong consulate regarding this matter, and the details are unknown.

<p>The Personnel Returned to Shanghai Separately to Report on the Process and Began to Compile a Chronicle of the Industry in Shanxi Province</p>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports: The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry selects and organizes industrial investigation teams every year to conduct on-the-spot investigations in predetermined provinces in order to compile a chronicle of the industry in that province with the information collected. Last year, it first organized the Hunan Industrial Investigation Team, and then compiled the Hunan Province Industrial Chronicle, which has now been published. In July of this year, the Bureau re-organized the Shanxi Industrial Investigation Team and went to Shanxi for on-the-spot work. It took three months to complete. The team's investigators Yao Fangren, Jiang Fu, Jiang Xuekai, Meng Erzang, and Ma Jibo left Shanxi and returned to Shanghai earlier this month. Lu Guoxiang and Yang Zhujun did not return to Shanghai together until yesterday due to certain investigation work. After returning to the bureau, the members reported on the investigation process separately, and began drafting the Shanxi Province Industrial Chronicle based on the work plan, with the goal of completing the compilation and publication in three months. Next spring, another investigation team will be formed for the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi to set off for investigation.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the new monetary policy and announced measures to stabilize finance, some unscrupulous merchants in various regions have taken the opportunity to raise prices. The Shanghai Municipality previously stipulated methods for preventing rising prices by the Social Bureau, ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to order various industries to comply. After receiving the order, the various industry associations submitted reports to the bureau on their compliance with the order. However, a very small number of people have still failed to comply with the order and submit reports to the bureau. At a time when the municipality is strictly prohibiting price increases, this slow-moving behavior is extremely inappropriate. Therefore, the Social Bureau specifically ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to re-order various industries that have not submitted reports to comply with the previous order and not to delay in any way, so as not to violate the law.</p>

Unexpectedly, several Japanese police officers came to the police station on the 14th of this month and detained them. On the 17th, they were escorted to the Rokko Maru of the Japanese Postal Ship Company and returned to China. They are scheduled to petition the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau today for relief.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Laochengfeng Company yesterday regarding the stamp tax that should be paid on rent books, stating: We are responding to your letter of inquiry of the 19th of this month regarding whether or not stamp tax should be paid on rent books. According to the so-called rent book in your letter, it is a rental document contract in Article 16, Section 10 of the Stamp Tax Law. The tax rate in the section has been stipulated. If a rent book is used to collect rent, stamp tax of two jiao per item per year should be paid according to the example of the fourth item of the same article. The so-called collection of rent in the letter is in accordance with the nature column, which states that all documents and contracts related to the rental of various movable or immovable properties and leased land are applicable. Therefore, whether it is a house rent book or a field rent book, stamp tax should be paid in accordance with the law. Your letter refers to Section 11 of the same article, stating that it is not for business use, but it does not take into account Section 10 of the same article, which is a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Hiding with Mistress in De Lin Apartment - Detained by Police and Remanded for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Yang Peter, a native of Guangdong, 32 years old, was an employee in the vault of the Guangdong Bank in Hong Kong. In August of the year before last, he embezzled more than 198,000 yuan from the bank and fled without a trace. The bank reported it to the Hong Kong government, which issued Arrest Warrant No. 18 on August 15, 1931, offering a reward for his arrest. Yang, using the alias Peter, came to Shanghai and stayed, keeping his whereabouts secret and living freely. Recently, he hid with his mistress Wang Baoqiong (also from Guangdong) in Room 242 of the De Lin Apartment on Chongming Road. The bank found out and telegraphed the Hongkou Police Department. At 8:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Zheng Zulin and Western Detective K. Kopple went to the address and arrested him. Three leather suitcases were found in the room, containing more than a hundred pieces of men's and women's clothing, as well as a Citibank deposit receipt for 1,000 yuan, Hong Kong banknotes and silver coins, and Chinese currency totaling more than 300 yuan. There were quite a few gold ornaments, jade articles, and jewels. He and Wang were taken to the police station. After questioning, it was found that Gan Baoqiong was not involved in the case and was released. Yang was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, recounted the incident and requested that he be detained to consider the issue of jurisdiction and whether the Hong Kong authorities would extradite him, with a postponement of ten days. When questioned, Yang Peter confessed that the above-mentioned sum was not embezzled, but was a loan released through his hands. Yan Jiangyi, a lawyer, defended him. Judge Su Xiexun ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<p>Dance Hall Employee Commits Violence - Fined 40 Yuan</p>
<p>The Vienna Dance Hall at No. 6 Dahua Road has recently been extensively renovated and new dancers have been recruited to join the dance. A dancer named Liang Dieying also joined the dance hall on the 9th of this month. To enhance her appearance, Liang ordered ten flower baskets from the Sisters Flower Shop at No. 1151 Jing'an Temple Road on the 8th, priced at 22 yuan. At that time, Liang wanted to reduce the price, so the shop and Liang agreed that if the baskets were returned three days later, the price could be reduced to 16 yuan. It was immediately agreed to do so. The Sisters Flower Shop sent the baskets on the 9th. When the three days were up, Ma Rongsheng ordered his partners Gao Sangu and Tan Xiaomao to go to Vienna to return the flower baskets, but they were blocked by the dance hall staff. They tried to retrieve them twice, but failed. At 6:15 p.m. on the 12th, Ma Rongsheng personally went with two partners, but he was again stopped by Wang Shengfa, an employee of the dance hall from Ningbo. A conflict arose. Wang punched Ma violently in the chest, and Ma fell down, his waist hitting a bucket, causing injury. Ma reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered Detective Lu Baozhong to investigate. Ma was sent to the Red Cross Hospital, where it was found that Ma's chest and waist were slightly injured. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution against Wang Shengfa for injury under Article 177 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, the Special Court summoned Wang to court. The police lawyer Qian explained the case. When questioned, Wang admitted to pushing Ma to the ground, but denied punching him. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and sentenced Wang to a fine of 40 yuan, with a 40 yuan guarantee letter to be submitted within the appeal period. The Shanghai County Minhang Public Education Center regards the New Life Collective Wedding as the only good method to solve the difficulty of marriage for the people. At a time when the people are poor and money is exhausted, and life is difficult, it is even more necessary to promote it. Therefore, it specially launched the first rural collective wedding. The wedding ceremony was held the other day, and those who went to visit were very enthusiastic. This collective wedding is still an innovation in Shanghai County. The following is an exploration of the various situations:</p>
<p>General Arrangement</p>
<p>The arrangement of this collective wedding by the center is quite solemn and simple. In addition to a horizontal plaque outside the center gate with the golden characters "Minhang Public Education Center First New Life Collective Wedding," a ceremonial table is set up in the center of the hall, with the Party and National flags and the portrait of the President Sun Zhongshan hanging above it. Red candles are burning high on the ceremonial table, and a couplet written by Director Jin is hung on the side, saying, "Matching women with husbands, the Duke of Zhou ceremony of the old era," "Changing customs and habits, the collective wedding of the new life," which is quite popular and easy to understand. The hall is also equipped with dozens of benches for the new couples and their families to come and watch the ceremony. On that day, the audience included people from various villages and representatives from various Party, government, and education agencies, totaling about a thousand people.</p>
<p>Wedding Circumstances</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony officially began at 2:00 p.m. The wedding was certified by County Magistrate Ye Zhendong and Education Bureau Director Zhu Hange, with Jin Zuobin and Wu Shifang as masters of ceremonies. During the wedding, three couples entered the hall one after another. After the ceremony, County Magistrate Ye, Education Bureau Director Zhu, Party Committee Member Zhang, Supervisory Committee Member Zhang, and County Public Security Bureau Director Xu gave speeches in succession. The Guangci Music Team played music, and the music team of the center's test area performed light music. The marriage certifier's speech elaborated on the significance of holding a collective wedding in great detail, which was quite fascinating.</p>
<p>Post-Wedding Talk</p>
<p>The center's holding of collective weddings is quite inexpensive, with each couple only paying six yuan in silver dollars. Everything is handled by the center, and tea and refreshments are provided to entertain the new couples and guests. After the wedding, Director Jin convened the parents of the new couples to talk, reporting on the distribution of expenses, and requesting that the sons and daughters born in the future be added to the Children's Happiness Association as members, so as to take care of them at all times. Finally, photos were taken to commemorate the event. It is heard that the participants in this collective wedding were: No. 1 Shen Dalin and Sun Jinbao, No. 2 Wang Gengsheng and Jiang Miaozhen, and No. 3 Zhang Heting and Huang Zhongmei.</p>

At that time, invitations will be sent to all walks of life to come and visit.</p>
<p>Great Scale</p>
<p>The hospital is located in Dachang Town, covering an area of more than 80 acres. It was designed by architect Fan Wenzhao and constructed by Sheng Yunji Construction Factory.

Each room is equipped with a steel wire bed, desk, wardrobe, and electric light, and is also equipped with a bathroom, flush toilet, and washroom. The facilities are excellent. The hospital building was built with a donation of 40,000 yuan from a large overseas Chinese businessman in Nanyang, Wen Hu, and is named "Wen Hu Memorial Hall." In addition, there are large auditoriums, reception rooms, libraries, factories, social rooms, kitchens, etc. The factory is divided into two types: laundry and woodworking.

<p>According to the Japanese "Shanghai Daily," Keijiro Fujinuma, a resident of Tokyo residing at No. 14, Lane 81, Kunshan Road, colluded with his fellow broker Tomoyoshi Takeuchi to forge Japanese naval documents to secretly transport 200 boxes of rayon, totaling 4 million pounds worth more than 67,000 yuan, to swindle a huge sum of money from Chinese merchants. The case has been completely exposed. The Japanese Consulate General announced the following on the evening of the 19th: Last December, a Chinese merchant Xu Pizhang entrusted a Japanese broker Takeuchi to secretly transport rayon. Takeuchi had previously served as an interpreter in the Japanese Army. Xu did not know that he had been dismissed, and Takeuchi also falsely claimed that he was still serving as a secretary and interpreter in the Marine Corps Headquarters, and said that he could obtain a transportation permit from the Ministry of the Navy. Xu believed it to be true, so last December, he invited several Chinese capitalists, including Zhou Jingru, to the Zhonghui Building to meet with Takeuchi and Fujinuma. Zhou Jingru sent a representative Zhou Huizhao to negotiate and order 200 boxes of rayon. Fujinuma agreed with Zhou to pay 34,000 yuan in foreign currency. After the rayon arrived in Shanghai, it was agreed that each box would be given to Takeuchi and Fujinuma as a reward of 30 yuan. Takeuchi and Fujinuma then proceeded to forge naval documents, "Japanese Navy Permit." Takeuchi also obtained 800 yuan from Xu Pizhang in the name of travel expenses and lobbying fees, and took his mistress Masako Tamaya to Japan. Fujinuma also obtained 100 yuan from Xu for travel expenses, and went to Japan with Xu's agent Gu Guxiang. They met with Takeuchi in Kyoto. After Gu obtained the permit from Takeuchi, he telegraphed Xu Pizhang in Shanghai to remit the money. Xu remitted 38,880 yuan from the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai. Takeuchi claimed to prepare for the transportation of goods and travel expenses, obtained 6,000 yuan, and spent it lavishly with Fujinuma. Half of the rayon was sold off in Dalian, leaving only 10,000 pounds, which were transported to Shanghai by the Liangzhou Maru. The 18,000 yuan of money sold in Dalian was distributed jointly, with Fujinuma getting more than 7,000 yuan and Takeuchi more than 5,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, when the Liangzhou Maru arrived in Shanghai, it was discovered by the Customs, and the matter was exposed. The Japanese Consulate has investigated the case and sentenced Fujinuma to two years in prison and Takeuchi to two years and six months.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Letter from the Tobacco Exchange Guild to the Money Exchange Guild: Request to Investigate the “Guangjiao” Black Market Rate <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Guild sent a letter to the Money Exchange Guild yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Money Exchange Guild: Upon receiving your letter stating that, following orders, the exchange rate for subsidiary coins should be fixed at 12 "jiao" per yuan from November 4th, with no increases or decreases allowed, we immediately notified all members to comply. However, the recent fluctuations in exchange rates have caused misunderstandings among outsiders, who believe that tobacco exchange shops are manipulating the market and creating chaos. Therefore, we convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members on the afternoon of the 19th of this month to discuss 'What is the root cause of the current discrepancies in exchange rates, and how should this be thoroughly investigated?' According to reports from various members, the daily money market quotations specify an exchange rate of 12 "jiao" for subsidiary coins. However, the 'Shanghai Business Voice Daily' (also known as the "Foreign Cent Sheet") published on November 19th listed a "Guangjiao" black market rate of '11 "jiao" and 1 "li"'. Tobacco exchange shops exchange one yuan of legal tender for 11 "jiao" and 1 "li" from various money exchange shops. This is equivalent to 10 "jiao" in small silver coins and 25 copper coins, which is in line with the "Guangjiao" black market rate. Therefore, each yuan of legal tender exchanged for 10 "jiao" and 25 copper coins leaves no profit for tobacco exchange shops, making it clear that there is no manipulation or chaos. The "Guangjiao" black market rate on the "Foreign Cent Sheet" is puzzling. We request the Money Exchange Guild to investigate and respond to clarify the situation." The records have been documented. Enclosed are two copies of the "Foreign Cent Sheet" from November 19th and 20th. We hope that your guild will investigate and respond accordingly."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the prices of Japanese-made flour and cotton yarn have risen, showing some improvement. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed Rong Zongjing, a leading figure in these industries. His remarks are as follows:</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>"My factories, including Shenxin, Maoxin, and Fuxin, had previously suspended operations entirely due to a shortage of raw materials. They have now gradually resumed operations, but work remains intermittent due to raw materials and sales issues. The current flour market is more expensive than in the past, due to the fact that wheat from various regions has been sold out, leading to a shortage of raw materials and rising flour prices. Consequently, the factories' work schedules are constantly uncertain. Previously, this port could sell 3.5 million (units), but now only half of that can be sold, effectively reducing sales. Furthermore, due to cost considerations, foreign raw materials are not being imported. Recently, the market has declined, and rice is cheaper than flour."</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>"Regarding cotton yarn, the floods in various regions this year have also reduced production compared to the past. Many Chinese-owned yarn factories have suspended operations. Although the market price has risen by 20 yuan compared to the past, they are still struggling to survive. Regarding the resumption of operations at Shenxin Factories 2 and 3, although unemployed workers are in dire need of relief, the environment restricts any possible solutions. The yarn market is in decline and cannot be sustained. As for rumors that the Ministry of Industry will send personnel to help with the resumption of operations, I have not heard anything about it."</p>

<p>Requires a Minimum of 70% Silver Bars</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, although silversmiths have expressed dissatisfaction with the silver usage regulations, the Ministry of Finance believes that the plans have been finalized and cannot be changed. Furthermore, yesterday's newspaper carried a dispatch from Nanjing, stating that a responsible person from the Ministry of Finance believes that the silver usage management rules for silver products were decided after expert research and that some parts follow American precedents. In response, the reporter interviewed Chuan Shengmao, from the Shanghai Silversmiths Guild. According to him, "The silver usage rules for silver products announced by the Ministry of Finance are indeed based on American methods. However, the United States uses machine manufacturing, so the hardness of the silver does not have an impact. China uses handcrafting and has always used pure silver. If we switch to chemical silver, all existing tools will have to be replaced. Furthermore, chemical silver has a poor color and will result in rough and unsightly utensils. This will inevitably affect the business of silversmiths. The current opinion of silversmiths in Shanghai is to request the government to allow the use of 88 silver bars (i.e., 88 taels of silver per 100 taels). At the very least, they should be allowed to use silver bars containing 70% silver; otherwise, the silversmiths' business cannot be sustained."</p>

<p>Investigation the Next Morning Confirms it: The New Tenant is a Child Trafficker</p>
<p>Wang Jiandong, a 33-year-old man from Hangzhou, and Wang Wu, a 37-year-old woman from Huzhou, claiming to be husband and wife, rented a back room on the second floor of No. 2 Hengqing Lane, Belle Road in the French Concession, on the morning of the 11th of this month. They agreed with the sub-landlord, Yang Shuncai, on a monthly rent of 5 yuan. That afternoon, Wang and his wife moved in with a child of about five years old. Little did people know, Wang and his wife were not engaged in legitimate work, but were child traffickers, specializing in luring and selling boys and girls. The rented room was used as a hiding place for the abducted children. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 3 p.m., another woman, an accomplice of Wang and his wife, abducted Luo Xiaomao, a five-year-old boy, the son of Luo Jinru, the owner of Lichang Knitting Factory at No. 33 Xujiahui Road (east end of Belle Road) in the French Concession. The boy was handed over to Wang and his wife to be hidden at home. After losing his child, Luo Jinru sent people to search for him everywhere, but to no avail. That night, late at night, the child Luo Xiaomao cried incessantly because he was with strangers and missing his parents and family. Wang and his wife tried all kinds of coaxing, but it was ineffective. That night, the landlord, Yang Shuncai, and his family heard the child's crying and recognized the voice as that of Luo Jinru's son, Xiaomao, who had previously rented the front building. Because it was late at night, they didn't inquire about it but kept an eye on it. The next morning, they went upstairs to check on the child who had been crying the previous night and confirmed that it was Luo Xiaomao. Knowing that the child had been abducted, Yang Shuncai remained calm and secretly notified the child's parents and reported to the French police. Inspector Long Chenglong, Detective Zhang Ziying, Detective Dai Rongji, and others rushed to the address and arrested Wang Wu, along with the child she brought with her. The abducted child, Luo Xiaomao, was also rescued and returned to his family. Under interrogation, Wu confessed to abducting the child. Her husband, Wang Jiandong, had gone out early in the morning to buy clothing fabric to sew clothes for the abducted child and take him to another location for sale. Based on the confession, the police chief sent Detective Zhu Caicheng to wait at their residence. In less than ten minutes, the child trafficker Wang Jiandong returned home from outside, carrying a package of clothing fabric. He was immediately arrested and taken to the police station. Subsequently, three more accomplices, Li Wenqing, Lu Weng, and Cai Yucheng, were also apprehended and detained separately. Yesterday morning, the police transferred the five male and female defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the Police Department, briefly presented the case, requesting a two-week postponement to conduct a detailed investigation and arrest the remaining accomplices, and requested a trial. Judge Xiong Hui Ping questioned the defendants, then adjourned the hearing to the 19th and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody.</p>

Recently, her art has improved rapidly, and she has been praised by connoisseurs. This time, at the invitation of the fundraising group of the All-Provinces Flood Relief Association, she came to Shanghai to perform charity operas. Since the performance began, the front of the Golden Grand Theater has been bustling with traffic, creating a grand spectacle. However, Ms. Meng Xiaodong is physically weak and usually only performs once or twice a month to rest. This time, she came south with enthusiasm for relief efforts and performed continuously for ten days, which is commendable for her hard work. She stopped performing yesterday. However, Ms. Zhang Eyun will continue to perform her best works for three more days in response to the warm welcome from all circles. It is reported that the performance has been a great success.

<h3 id="e137">Tan Zhuo Sues Father to Restore Father-Son Relationship <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Father, Xiong Duyou, Remains Resolute; Lawyers' Mediation Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>Tan Jingyu, a wealthy merchant from Guangdong, lives at No. 21, Fuan Lane, Hesker Road in this city. He made his fortune by operating real estate and amassed a vast fortune. He also has a considerable reputation in the business world. Mr. Tan has two sons, the eldest is named Tan Zhuo, who is 34 years old and lives at No. 63, Lane 427, Xiaoshadu Road, Wuding Road in this city. He serves as an associate at the Puyi Real Estate Company in this city. In 1921, when Tan Zhuo was just a young man, he discovered that his father, Jingyu, had improper conduct, which caused his father's displeasure. He was then expelled in anger and a public statement was published, declaring the severance of their father-son relationship. At that time, Tan Zhuo was so stimulated that he was determined to become strong. He was admitted to the Whampoa Military Academy. After graduation, he went to Germany for further study. After returning to China, he participated in the revolutionary work. In 1927, the Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition, and he made some meritorious contributions. In 1930, he retired from the army and returned to Shanghai, where he worked at the Puyi Real Estate Company. However, considering that his father was old and worried about misunderstandings in the future and the duty of a son to serve, he requested to return home. However, Tan Jingyu still remembered the old hatred and refused in strong words. Tan Zhuo was forced to resort to law, but because it violated the principle of not suing twice for the same matter, his case was rejected by the court. He then appealed to the Supreme Court to confirm the father-son relationship. According to the Supreme Court's ruling No. 955 of 1934, Lawyers Chen Zhen and Liu Shichao filed a confirmation lawsuit with the local court. The court once approved the summons for trial, but the defendant did not appear in court. At 10 a.m. yesterday, Judge Zhu Run specially opened the Second Court for trial. The defendant, Tan Jingyu, still did not appear in court, but only entrusted a lawyer to appear in court as an agent. The plaintiff, Tan Zhuo, came to court with Lawyers Chen and Liu and testified: "I am 34 years old, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, living at No. 63, Lane 427, at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Wuding Road. I request confirmation of inheritance and the elimination of interference with my rights. I am the defendant's legitimate eldest son. In July 1921, the defendant suspected that I had lost my integrity and published a statement declaring the severance of our father-son relationship. He also filed an employment case with the Shanghai Mixed Court. At that time, I thought that the defendant's statement severing the father-son relationship was a kind of disciplinary measure and that the nominal father-son relationship between us still existed. Therefore, since being expelled, I have studied hard for more than ten years. Later, I participated in the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army and made some meritorious contributions. In 1930, I retired from the army and returned to Shanghai. I repeatedly asked my father to return home to serve him and fulfill my filial duty, but he still remembered the old evils and did not allow it. I had no choice but to sue according to law." Then, the defendant's lawyer stated, "The defendant, Tan Jingyu, is 60 years old, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, living at No. 21, Anfu Lane, Hesker Road. He is unable to attend today due to illness. However, this lawyer has mediated several times, but the defendant has expressed his firm determination, making it difficult to approach him." The presiding judge then declared, "Fundamentally, there is no possibility of severing the father-son relationship. Therefore, the defendant's lawyer should be instructed to convey to the defendant that he must personally attend the next hearing for verification." Then the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have just read a news item in today's newspaper about the conclusion of the lawsuit between lawyers Lu Xingyuan and Qiu Hanping. There are some inaccuracies in it, such as the use of abusive language and the claim that he would have his hair shaved and made a prisoner, which are completely inconsistent with the facts. Mr. Xingyuan made a statement in court yesterday to state the plaintiff's intention, and of course, he presented various evidence and facts against the defendant, Qiu Hanping, attacking him for having no evidence and no excusable reason. This kind of attack is of course permitted by law, so what is the basis for saying that he was using abusive language? Furthermore, Mr. Xingyuan stated that Qiu Hanping had reported groundless accusations to the police and the court, requesting the detention of Mr. Xingyuan, Shi Zhinan, and Wang Dushi. If the authorities had mistakenly listened to him and immediately arrested them, Mr. Xingyuan and others would have suffered unexpected insults and serious damages, or if the court of first instance had wrongly convicted and sentenced them, they would have been detained in the Western Jail and had their hair shaved. Even if they were acquitted, there would be no compensation for the unjust imprisonment. The trend of false accusations should not be allowed to continue. Finally, based on the documentary evidence presented in court, Qiu Hanping had committed a criminal act and should be punished with the crime he deserved, without probation, in order to deter others. This is the actual situation that day. I should like to request that your newspaper reproduce this letter for correction, for the sake of public justice. Sincerely, Lawyer Lu Xingyuan, November 20th.</p>

<p>— Shen Gongzhan (November of the 24th year in Shanghai)</p>
<p>——Respectfully dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party and gentlemen who are interested in discussing political reform—</p>
<p>(6) The President should be considered the head of government who controls the "governing power". Therefore, the clause in the original draft constitution that "the President exercises executive power" should be amended to "the President exercises governing power", so that it is in line with the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution's creation of separately defined "powers". Therefore, the presidents of the five Yuan can all be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the National Assembly, rather than being elected by the National Assembly. As for the members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, the presidents of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan can nominate candidates separately according to the population ratio of each region, not limited to the representatives of the National Assembly (at least more than half should be members of the Nationalist Party), and submit them to the President for approval and then to the National Assembly for approval before appointing them. In this way, even if the National Assembly is adjourned, there will still be a portion of national representatives able to participate in the work of legislation and supervision. In addition, if the Legislative Yuan or the Control Yuan's duties involve any powers within a certain regime, they should be included in the duties of the National Assembly, or at least submitted to the National Assembly or</p>
<p>the Provisional National Assembly for approval before they can take effect, in order to clarify the boundaries of power.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the organizers of the Party:</p>
<p>(1) The internal organization of the Nationalist Party should be made even more rigorous. In addition to the Premier, there should be a Director-General (or Leader) who has overall command of the Party. In addition to the Director-General, a Central Executive Committee should be established as the organ for deciding the Party's program and policies. The Director-General has the power of final decision and is responsible for guiding its implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The Central Party Headquarters should be as active as possible, taking control of the core of the National Assembly. Other party headquarters at all levels should also be as active as possible, taking control of the core of local parliamentary and consultative bodies.</p>
<p>(3) The executive organs of provincial or special municipal party headquarters should change from an election system to a special appointment system, with one to three commissioners appointed by the Central Party Headquarters to preside over them. The supervisory organs should still be elected by each level.</p>
<p>(4) Whether to establish county or district party headquarters should be determined by each province or municipality, taking into account local conditions and submitting proposals to the Central Government for approval. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e146">Overview of the Shanghai Woolen Industry (Continued) <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(Two of the Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>The Shanghai woolen industry has entered the second stage from the first stage. The performance in terms of woolen imports is the sudden decrease in the amount (only imported more than one million customs gold units in the first nine months of this year). The performance in terms of wool imports, on the contrary, is the sharp increase in the amount, increasing from 931,461 customs gold units in the 22nd year to 2,816,084 customs gold units in the 23rd year. (Because wool raw materials need to be imported six months or one year in advance) One decrease and one increase is the most worthy of consideration. We should realize that if we want to remedy the past leak of the woolen industry, we must pay close attention to animal husbandry in the Northwest. 2. Overview of Shanghai's Chinese and Foreign Woolen Factories</p>
<p>The manufacturing of woolens in Shanghai is a new phenomenon in recent years, which can be divided into two types. One is specialized manufacturing, such as Shanghai China Bodeyun and other factories, and the other is part-time manufacturing, such as the former Zhenxing and Zhanghua factories, which spun woolens in addition to woolen fabrics. Another example is the Yihe and Shanghai Textile factories, which are engaged in cotton textile industry and also manufacture woolens. The situation of the main factories is recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>1. Yumin Textile Company</p>
<p>Yumin Textile Company was jointly established by the woolen shops on Xingsheng Street in the French Concession. It was established in September last year with a capital of 100,000 national currency. The address is on the Rong Maochang Building at No. 43 Xingsheng Street, French Concession, Shanghai. There is no separate factory. The Shuangyang brand and Shuangshou brand woolens are all manufactured by Anle Cotton Wool Weaving Factory on Bailinan Road. The wool required is purchased from Australia by Deki Lixing and Yihua companies.</p>
<p>2. Shanghai Woolen Textile Factory</p>
<p>Shanghai Woolen Textile Factory was jointly established by Wang Qiyu, Yu Zuoting, Guo Shun and other magnates. It was established in October last year with a capital of 150,000 yuan. The general issuing office is located at No. 349 Ningbo Road, and the factory is located at No. 61 Yangshupu Road. It specializes in spinning woolens, mostly four-strand velvet. It can produce 1,500 pounds per day. Its trademark is Xiaonan. Other Golden Dog, Double Cat, and Double species have not yet been started. There are more than a dozen machines in the factory, with 600 woolen spindles. Including other auxiliary machines, the total value is about 100,000 yuan. More than hundreds of workers are employed, mostly female workers.</p>
<p>3. China Woolen Textile Factory</p>
<p>The China Woolen Textile Factory is different from Yumin and Shanghai. It is independently operated by Chen Zhilian, a native of Lianxing, Zhejiang, with a capital of about 1.5 million yuan. It started manufacturing in July of this year. The factory is located at No. 188 Jianqing Road, covering an area of more than twelve mu. Its machines are ordered from French manufacturers by Dewey Foreign Company. There are two warping machines, one doubling machine, eight drawing machines, five spindle machines, and zero-component motors, etc., worth about 200,000 yuan. About five or sixty workers are employed. The Queen brand woolen, which has suddenly emerged in the market, is its product.</p>
<p>4. Bodeyun Woolen Thread Factory</p>
<p>Shanghai Bodeyun Woolen Thread Factory is a branch of the parent factory in England. Its head office and factory are located north of Dinghai Bridge on Poyang Road, and the business office is located at No. 2 Beijing Road. The capital is about 10 million Chinese currency. The factory building was completed at the end of last year, and officially started production in March of this year. It can produce one British pound of velvet thread per day. A total of more than 600 male and female workers are employed. In addition to the well-known Bee brand, the products also include Azalea and Parrot brands.</p>
<p>The above four are newly emerging factories specializing in the manufacture of woolens. In addition, the British-owned Yihua Yarn Factory also produces Five Blessings brand woolens, and the Japanese-owned Shanghai Yarn Factory also produces non-branded woolens, which are mixed and sold on the market. Since they are not specialized operations, they are not described in detail. The latest market prices of woolens produced by each factory are listed below for comparison. (Unit: yuan)</p>
<p>Factory Name Woolen Brand Wholesale Price Retail Price</p>
<p>Bodeyun Bee 2.90 3.20</p>
<p>Bodeyun Azalea 1.50 ——</p>
<p>Yumin Double Hand 1.70 2.40</p>
<p>Shanghai Xiaonan 1.50 1.90</p>
<p>China Queen 3.00 3.30</p>
<p>Yihua Five Blessings 0.80 ——</p>
<p>Shanghai Yarn Factory No Brand 2.50 ——</p>
<p>Generally speaking, due to competition and sluggish sales, the market price of woolens this year is slightly lower than last year. However, since the implementation of the new currency policy recently, the price of imported wool has been expensive, and the market prices of various brands have turned upward again.</p>
<p>Yumin's Sheep brand and Shanghai's Xiaonan brand once dropped prices to compete for sales, and both sides were considerably affected. However, in September of this year, Yumin Company ordered 200 packages of Xiaonan brand from Shanghai Woolen Textile Factory, and the two sides have the intention of starting cooperation, which is really good news for Chinese businesses to cooperate to resist foreign aggression. The Bee brand produced by Bodeyun has a long history and its promotion power is also great, making it a formidable competitor for Chinese businesses. What is somewhat comforting is that its sales are mainly limited to South China, while Chinese businesses are biased towards North China, which may not be directly opposed. In short, whether the national woolen industry can continue to develop in the future depends on the one hand on the rectification and prosperity of the domestic political economy, and on the other hand on the ability to cope with external pressures.</p>

<p>Guangxi Province Promotes Compulsory Education Very Hard</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) Ma Junwu, the president of Guangxi University, came to Peiping from Shanghai a few days ago to visit various friends. At 11 am on the 19th, the reporter went to Bai Pengfei's private residence, the president of the Faculty of Law and Commerce of Peiping University, to visit Ma (Ma lives in Bai's house) to inquire about the recent situation of Guangxi University and the development of compulsory education teachers and vocational education teachers in the province in recent years. Ma made the following statement: Guangxi University was founded in the 17th year of the Republic of China. The campus is located in Wuzhou. It is divided into three colleges: science, agriculture, and engineering. There are no colleges of liberal arts or law. The main reason is that there are many young people in Guangxi studying in other provinces who specialize in liberal arts and law, and there is a lack of personnel in science, agriculture, and engineering. There are currently more than 800 students in the school, including only more than 60 female students. The College of Science has four departments: mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. The dean is Duan Zixie. The College of Agriculture has two departments: agriculture and forestry. The dean is He Zhuqi. The College of Engineering has four departments: mechanical engineering, civil engineering, mining, and metallurgy. The dean is Jin Xiru. There are more than 100 faculty members. The faculty are all full-time, and the remuneration is the same as that of other universities in China. At the beginning of its establishment, the cost of equipment was about 1 million yuan. Therefore, in terms of equipment, such as the library, science laboratory, factory and farm, student dormitories, and auditorium, it can still be used. The annual recurring expenses are 400,000 yuan, which is directly allocated by the Guangxi Provincial Government. Faculty salaries account for about two-thirds, and equipment and book expenses account for about one-quarter. It is still difficult to talk about whether to add colleges of liberal arts, law, and medicine in the future. In recent years, industry and construction in Guangxi Province have made rapid progress, so most of the graduates of our school serve in the province. As for the recent promotion of compulsory education and vocational education in Guangxi Province, great efforts have also been made to gradually reduce illiteracy. However, the funding is not very sufficient, which is an obstacle to development. I (Ma refers to himself) took the opportunity of going to Beijing to report on school affairs to the Ministry of Education and came to Peiping to visit various friends. I will leave Peiping for Kaifeng on the 22nd to attend the engineering college of Henan University and give a lecture. After a short stay, I will go to Wuhan and then to Shanghai to return to Guangxi.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Ministry of Education Solicits Self-Compiled Lecture Notes for Various Vocational School Subjects <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education stated that vocational schools have a wide variety of subjects, and it is not easy to determine the standards for each subject's curriculum. The Ministry has already issued a letter to outstanding vocational schools and experts in various subjects in China, requesting them to draft course schedules and teaching material outlines for each subject, compile them into four volumes, and distribute them to various schools for reference. It is now found that vocational schools often edit their own lecture notes when selecting teaching materials for each subject, but the content varies in detail, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses, which urgently need to be improved. Therefore, the Ministry has specially solicited self-compiled lecture notes from public and private vocational schools that have been running for a long time or have achieved results, and will review them so that they can be adopted by various schools to improve them. It is appropriate to list the names of various schools and order the bureau to quickly forward the order to the schools to select self-compiled lecture notes or practical teaching materials for various vocational subjects that have been used for a considerable period of time and are considered suitable for application, and send them to the Ministry by a specified date for review. In addition, if the textbooks for each subject selected by the schools are considered to be suitable for the level and can be used for teaching, they should also indicate the publisher and the name of the editor of the book, and list them together and send them to the Ministry. Please be informed. This order includes a list of schools to be solicited. The list of schools to be solicited includes: Hebei Provincial Industrial College Affiliated Senior Industrial Vocational School, Provincial Baoding Senior Industrial Vocational School, Shanxi Province, Provincial Daiyuezhen Junior Animal Husbandry Vocational School, Shandong Province, Provincial Senior Industrial Vocational School, Anhui Province, Provincial Anqing Industrial Vocational School, Private Anhui Junior Vocational School, Hubei Province, Provincial Vocational School, Provincial Industrial Joint Industry School, Hunan Province, Provincial Senior Industrial Vocational School, Private Chuyi Middle School Non-Department, Private Xiuye Agricultural Vocational School, Jiangxi Province, Provincial First Vocational School, Provincial First Vocational School, Provincial Ceramic Vocational School, Jiangsu Province, Provincial Suzhou Industrial Vocational School, Provincial Cheng Song Aquatic Vocational School, Provincial Huaiyin Agricultural Vocational School, Provincial Suzhou Agricultural Vocational School, Provincial Shanghai Middle School Business Department, Provincial Suzhou Middle School Applied Chemistry Department, Provincial Yangzhou Middle School Civil Engineering Department, Provincial Suqian Glass Department Vocational School, Provincial Women's Sericulture Vocational School, Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang University on Behalf of Senior Industrial Vocational School, Zhejiang University on Behalf of Senior Agricultural Vocational School, Provincial Hangzhou Senior Middle School Business Department Private Mainland Senior Surveying Department Vocational School, Fujian Province, Provincial Fuzhou Industrial Vocational School, Provincial Longxi Vocational School, Private Jimei Aquatic Vocational School, Private Jimei Business Department Vocational School, Guangdong Province, Provincial First Vocational School, Shanghai City, National Tongji University Affiliated Senior Vocational School, Private China Vocational School, Private Lida Academy Rural Education Department, Peiping City, Municipal Senior Industrial Vocational School, Tianjin City, Municipal Normal Vocational Normal Department,</p>

<p>The Education Department Promises to Negotiate with the Finance Department</p>
<p>The affiliated elementary school of Zhejiang Provincial Middle School held its 8th regular meeting in Haimen Taichung Affiliated Elementary School. The attending representatives believed that the funding for the affiliated elementary school this year had been in arrears for a long time, affecting school affairs, and the salaries of teachers were meager and had to be discounted in the same way as middle schools. It was decided to submit a request to the Education and Finance Departments to jointly issue the funding for the affiliated elementary school and exempt all discounts. Representatives from Hangzhou High School, Hangzhou Normal School, Jiaxing Middle School, and Huzhou Middle School were elected to go to Beijing to petition. On the 18th, Yu Xuechen, the director of the affiliated elementary school conference office, led the petition to the Education Department. Because Director Xu attended the Fifth National Congress, the head of the department, Luo Dixian, and Li Zhenxia received the petition and promised to negotiate with the Finance Department to release the funds for the affiliated elementary school separately on a monthly basis, exempt from discounts, and review the matter in the next fiscal year.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"We all need these small helps; so you must try to learn your lessons and work hard, play with the children in a kind way, and make good use of your holidays; if you can give me an excellent report, or although I don't say it, I have already seen it and know it, because I am very good at detecting all the good efforts of my children—then you can win a drawer in which to put your treasures. You see, some drawers have already been divided into four small parts, and I will order other drawers to be done in the same way, each part for one week; when that drawer is full of precious and beautiful things, I will be as proud as you are, I think even more proud—because in those pebbles, moss, and beautiful butterflies, I will see the thorough implementation of good will, the self-control of mistakes, and the fulfillment of promises. Shall we do this, Don?"</p>
<p>The boy didn't say a word, just looked at her, but his expression showed that he deeply felt and understood her words and wishes, but he didn't know how to express his gratitude for that kind of love and kindness: she also understood that kind of expression, and seeing his face flushed, knew that he was indeed moved—which was exactly what she hoped for—she then stopped saying a word about that brand new plan, but took out the highest drawer, brushed off the dust, and placed it on two chairs in front of the sofa, and hurriedly said:</p>
<p>"Now, let's immediately start putting those interesting hard-shelled insects in a safe place. These grids can hold many things, you see. I will nail the butterflies and insects on the four sides; this way they are very safe, leaving the bottom to place larger pieces. I will give you some raw cotton, clean paper, and pins, so you can prepare for this week's work."</p>
<p>"But I can't go out to find new things," Don said, looking at his feet, showing a pitiful look.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: St. John's Defeats Jiaotong Again <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Xu Wenkui and Zhu Wenji Perform Excellently; Jiaotong Lacks Coordination and Strength, Zhou Guangzhong Struggles to Support the Entire Team</p>
<p>The St. John's University football team, possessing many strong players, has recently added Xu Chengxun, the Fujian representative from the current National Games, further strengthening its power. In yesterday's match against Jiaotong University, Jiaotong was overwhelmed. Xu Wenkui, Zhu Wenji, and others delivered outstanding performances. Jiaotong appeared weak and disorganized; Xue Wenxiu and Zhou Guangzhong struggled to carry the team. As a result, Jiaotong lost to St. John's again with a score of 3-1.</p>
<p>First Half: 2-1</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the referee, Mr. Bibei'er, blew the silver whistle, and the two teams lined up to compete. Jiaotong took the initial offensive, displaying great momentum. St. John's Xu Guangyao, in his eagerness to save the ball, carelessly touched it with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Shao Jihua took the penalty, sending the ball into the upper left corner, opening the scoring. St. John's then launched a vigorous attack. Zhu Wenji initiated an offensive from the flank, reaching an opportune spot and passing it to the center. Xu Wenkui received the ball, unleashed a powerful shot, and scored, leveling the score at 1-1. After the kickoff from the center line, Zhou Guangzhong received the ball and sent it far to Wenxiu. However, Wenxiu was too eager for victory and shot too high, returning empty-handed. St. John's Li Guangxing dribbled the ball forward, passing it to Zhu Wenji. Wenji dared not delay, forcefully kicking the ball towards Jiaotong's goal. Cheng Guoyin kicked it away, but not far enough. Fan Jiaju rushed forward to save the situation, but Zhu Wenji seized the opportunity, lightly tapping the ball, which went into the net again. Afterwards, the ball often hovered around Jiaotong's goal, fortunately Jiaju was agile and saved many dangerous shots. As a result, St. John's took the lead in the first half with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Second Half: 1-0</p>
<p>After the break, St. John's introduced fresh players, while Jiaotong retained the same lineup. The fighting became very loose, and the kicking lacked strength. The defense appeared weak, with repeated mistakes. Although Zhou Guangzhong ran all over the field, it was of no use. St. John's, however, grew stronger as the game progressed. Xu Chengxun shot directly at the goal from 30 yards, quickly and powerfully, but unfortunately missed. Zhu Wenji, seeing this, became even more determined to fight hard. Fan Jiaju calmly made two touches, and the ball bounced out. Jiaotong found it difficult to recover and lacked the strength. Xue Wenxiu missed two more opportunities, achieving nothing. St. John's Chen Ji'en advanced from the right, intending to pass it to the center, but without support, he shot directly at the goal, scoring successfully. This shot was clear and beautiful. From then on, both teams traded attacks, but neither team scored again. In the second half, St. John's won again with a score of 1-0. As a result, Jiaotong lost again with a score of 3-1. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>St. John's</p>

<p>Guanghua and Yuqing Groups Postponed</p>
<p>The first week of this year's football league, organized by the Shanghai Middle School Sports Federation, began yesterday. The original schedule included three groups: Guanghua vs. Hujiang, Yuqing vs. Minli, and Fushi vs. Fuzhong. However, Hujiang requested a postponement due to midterm exams. The standing committee decided to reschedule the match for three weeks later. Yuqing also suspended its match due to some issues, which will be decided by the standing committee at a meeting. Therefore, only the Fushi vs. Fuzhong group was played yesterday, at the Fuzhong field, with Leng Xueqiao as the referee. Fushi's strength was very balanced, especially the forwards showing good coordination. As a result, Fushi defeated Fuzhong 8-0. The details of the match are as follows:</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The match started at 2:30 PM, with the referee blowing the whistle. Both sides lined up to meet the challenge. Fushi's center-back, An Lesheng, was versatile and showed great leadership. Center-forward Hu Zongyi also had unique dribbling and shooting skills. Therefore, within five minutes of the start, Hu scored a goal. Soon after, Mao Kangshu initiated an attack from the flank, breaking through three lines of defense. Fuzhong's Wang Jifa was caught off guard and lightly deflected the ball, which still went into the net. Inside-forward Zhu Wenzhang was not to be outdone, adding to the score with another goal. Afterwards, Hu Zongyi scored again. The first half ended with Fushi leading 4-0.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and continued the battle. At this point, Fuzhong tried to counterattack, but the forwards lacked coordination and the defense was weak. Fushi's three forwards took advantage of the gaps and attacked like a bamboo shoot splitting open. Lin Jiazheng and Hu Zongyi scored successively, and Mao Kangshu and Dong Yanguang hit the target. After that, the two teams traded attacks, but neither team scored again. As a result, Fushi defeated Fuzhong 8-0. The two teams were originally from the same family, so they dispersed politely. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fudan Middle School (Fushi)</p>
<p>Li Wenjian, Xie Zuyin</p>
<p>Gao Shiying, Su Yan</p>

<p>The Bai Hong track and field team in this city possesses the essence of the country's track and field, and its strength is unmatched in the country. It is learned that for the sake of honing their skills, the team recently sent a letter to the Guangzhou Guangnan track and field team to discuss a competition in the south. They have now received a reply, expressing their agreement and allowing the team to depart next spring. However, the expenses for the trip south must be raised by the team themselves. However, the Bai Hong team's funds have always been very tight, and it is difficult to raise this huge amount of travel expenses. Therefore, according to the team, this expedition to the south may be difficult to realize.</p>

<p>The Huaxi Small Ball Competition Association organized the China-Germany Cup and Gordon Cup matches. The three matches last week were wonderful and extraordinary.

<p>— Zhu Zhen</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>One of the main goals of education is to help children achieve healthy and fulfilling lives. To achieve this goal, schools should modify all their procedures, curricula, methods, management, administrative organization, and physical facilities from a mental hygiene perspective. Schools should first establish a standard to determine whether a child's behavior truly exhibits characteristics of maladjustment. If so, the school should find ways to help these maladjusted children achieve greater social and emotional satisfaction.</p>
<p>The first basic need that schools should satisfy for children is the need for spontaneous expression—an outlet for their energy. Methods of providing this outlet often utilize public group life, in which all activities are based on the children's interests, not on their academic standing. Such methods as handicrafts, music, artistic performances, cooking, photography, and other central activities can be used as early as the third grade of elementary school.</p>
<p>The second basic need that schools should satisfy for children is to enable them to participate in socialized activities. Therefore, the school itself should become a free and democratic society, where children can take on responsibilities such as maintaining school buildings and lawns, planning meeting programs, discussing the order of entry into classrooms or auditoriums, and managing school stores, libraries, or cafeterias. Of course, these responsibilities should not include judging criminals or imposing penalties, as this is contrary to mental hygiene.</p>
<p>The spirit of child socialization is cultivated in group life activities or designs. For example, we can have first-graders set up a post office, second-graders build a playground, and sixth-graders organize labor unions, establish school banks, and distribute all school supplies. In these designs, children can maximize their energy and expression according to their interests.</p>
<p>The third need that schools should satisfy for children is a sense of security. They can achieve this goal through spontaneous expression and participation in social activities, not only at school but also at home, to ensure they always feel safe.</p>
<p>(2) Curriculum</p>
<p>From a mental hygiene perspective, all curricula should include those parts that are truly useful for children's lives. Useless and meaningless parts of the curriculum should be removed. Therefore, the curriculum standards we adopt that are consistent with mental hygiene education should be practical. However, there is another standard: teaching materials that children cannot handle should be provided to them after they mature. Modern schools often neglect children's psychological preparation. Therefore, we should study which teaching materials are suitable for each stage of children's psychological growth.</p>
<p>(3) Management</p>
<p>In the sense of mental hygiene, management includes the training of teachers. Teachers should have knowledge of mental hygiene before teaching children and should constantly pursue it after teaching. Secondly, it includes the spirit of cooperation among teachers. At the same time, the school should give teachers freedom, so that they have creative ideas and are allowed to participate in the planning, research, and organization of the curriculum, and even the opportunity to decide on the school's administrative policies.</p>
<p>(4) Administration</p>
<p>In order to pay attention to children's emotional well-being, the school's administrative organization should abolish the system of failing grades and grade retention. Traditional school administrative systems do not pay attention to this point; they punish students without considering the emotional impact of such punishment. For example, in the Winnetka schools in the United States, students are not given grades or ratings for each subject. On their report cards, only an "S" (Satisfactory) or a negative "-" sign is recorded for schoolwork and conduct. Every extremely stupid or extremely clever child should receive an "S" mark because they believe that the negative sign can easily damage a child's emotions, so their teachers try to minimize the negative signs. Secondly, the method of correcting children's test papers or exams should also be different from the norm. Although the errors and corrections on the papers are all indicated, the element of competition in the class should be absolutely prohibited from being announced.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of children's mental hygiene, the entire administrative organization of the school should be flexible so that the curriculum, methods, and other aspects can be adapted to each child. In addition, physical facilities are also important for children's mental hygiene. Therefore, the school should have reasonable physical facilities for children's creative work and socialized activities. However, this type of equipment does not require a lot of money to purchase, as they are mostly various tools and materials for children's work. Finally, the atmosphere in the classroom should be familial, informal, and arranged to please the eye.</p>
<p>(5) Cultivating Normal Behaviors in Children</p>
<p>We undoubtedly neglect the harmless maladjustments of children. Children who outwardly obey teachers often do not attract the deep attention of teachers. In fact, inside them, there is already a kind of unhappy emotion or the suppression of unsatisfied desires. This kind of internal suppression is more dangerous than the outward behavior that indicates maladjustment. Therefore, this behavior is by no means a child's normal behavior. On the other hand, we always pay close attention to disturbing and rebellious children, and often think that their behavior is abnormal. In fact, the behavior exhibited by such children is normal behavior and is of great value from the perspective of the child's mechanical and emotional growth. Therefore, we hope that elementary school teachers will not use suppression methods exclusively but will allow their emotions to be expressed as much as possible. For example, the Winnetka schools in the United States pay very close attention to this point. They often invite psychiatric experts to observe whether the behavior of children in each classroom is normal to set up methods to remedy the situation. On the teacher side, they are also collecting materials on normal adaptation and maladapted children in each grade to do research, hoping to compile a scale of social and emotional behavior from this material to determine normal child behavior in various stages of maturity.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion</p>
<p>Mental hygiene is indeed an important issue in elementary schools, but it is unfortunately often neglected by so-called education experts. If we want to solve this problem, relying solely on the strength of principals and teachers is not enough. We are bound to also seek help from psychologists and psychiatrists, so elementary schools should hire such experts to be in charge of guidance. This point is certainly not easy to do in today's Chinese education world, where talent and economy are both lacking, but at least elementary school principals and teachers should have common sense about children's mental hygiene. In this way, even in a passive way, they can achieve considerable results.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Securities Bonds Fall First, Then Rise <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Forward Zheng Lu Creates Another Peak</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market situation remained oppressive. Although it had rebounded slightly, it was still pushed up by the financial industry. The environment and news were dull. It was only heard that the customs gold bonds would announce a fixed price of 2.5 yuan soon, and the gold standard public bonds would inevitably increase with the market. This may become a reality. In terms of the situation on the table, the financial industry and those close to it are all optimistic. The northern gang and a part of retail investors are bearish. Those who raise prices have reached this point, and their momentum has become like riding a tiger. Buying at low prices is their fixed step. Therefore, before the delivery of this month, even if there are repeated fluctuations, it will not be easy to have a huge decline. Looking at the decline at the opening and the rise at the close, which are no less than each other, you can see their means of raising prices. Therefore, the current trend has deviated from the environment and only considers the supply and demand of chips. Theory cannot beat fact. Only two rounds were done yesterday. In the first round in the morning, the reorganization and troop reduction were still good for several cents. From the 20th round, the selling pressure from No. 4 and the northern gang was extremely strong, and No. 54 also sold out. Although Nos. 33, 43, 48, and 78 bought in, they were not as sharp as the selling pressure from No. 4, and the price turned down across the board, becoming more severe later. However, the Zheng Lu, which had a limit up on the previous day, only fell by 1.5 yuan. The market sentiment turned firm again. In the second round in the afternoon, everyone expected that the reorganization and troop reduction would inevitably turn bearish, but they continued to rise by 23 cents. From the 20th round, No. 4 suddenly turned to buy in, with a huge appetite. Nos. 43, 48, and 79 also had large appetites. Between the two rounds, No. 4's entry and exit were completely opposite. The eyes of the gangs turned from surprise to pride, and the market price became more and more vigorous. The forward Zheng Lu soared by 1 yuan and 9.5 cents, creating a new high price. In total, the market price results, except for the unified salt tax, which was still down by 23 cents, all other varieties rose in unison, ranging from 23 cents to 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 35 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported that the New York stock market rose yesterday (19th). Although the bulls took profits, the buying power was sufficient, so the sellers had to surrender. Notices of increased dividends came one after another, the industrial background was extremely superior, resulting in new peaks emerging one after another. Small exchange stocks also rose, and the bond market was strong and active. The total transaction volume for the day was 2.88 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Yarn Market Weakens as Speculation Looms</p>
<p>After a big rise in the yarn market the previous day, it was slightly calmer yesterday, with a slight decline. However, the bulls believe that raw materials are afraid of being high, costs are increasing, and yarn stocks are thin, so they are optimistic about the yarn market. Therefore, the recent trend has been slightly firm. However, many securities speculators have emerged, and the amount is particularly large. Spot yarn transactions are relatively smooth.</p>
<p>Excessive Speculation in Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened in the early market, with each month showing a slight stagnation. The table was weak, but new buyers were not very enthusiastic. The first round fell by 7, 8, and 9 cents. The second round was slightly firmer and rebounded. By the time of the full three closings, it was heard that public bonds had fallen, and Hexing and Jinchang sold a large amount, resulting in a loose market and a downstream trend. As a result, each month fell by 48 cents to 1 yuan and 14 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day, but this month only fell by 3 cents. The afternoon opening still followed the remaining wind of the morning and was tired by 45 cents. However, when filming the second and third rounds, the trend suddenly became tight, and the buying air suddenly became strong, especially with the strong pull of the bulls, and it was heard that spot yarn transactions were slightly more active, and people's hearts were shaken. As a result, the near month was unchanged compared with the morning closing price, and the far month rose by 6 cents to 1 yuan. It was found that Dafeng sold 400 bales, Meiji 600 bales, Jinchang 1,750 bales, Hexing 2,250 bales, Runkang 1,400 bales, Yongda 700 bales, Tonghe 450 bales, Zhenda 500 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, Xicheng 400 bales, and Xincheng 700 bales. Dafu bought 1,850 bales, Yuda 450 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, Mingjiu 900 bales, Senkang 700 bales, Shenji 1,25 bales, Yuanyi 1,000 bales, and Shengyuan 1,050 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Inventory</p>

<p>Japanese Bulls Take Profits</p>
<p>When the cotton market rose sharply the previous day, the Japanese took profits, resulting in a looser table. However, most of the large amounts were closely tied and not released, and the purchase of chips was concentrated in the far term, so the distance between the near and far terms became farther and farther. However, most merchants are very active in arbitrage trading. It is said that this month's receipts and payouts of 1, 2, and month terms can obtain a profit of 3.7% interest.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao May Fall</p>
<p>The Huatian Market opened in the early market, and the near-month decline was particularly fierce. It is said that the bulls of a certain foreign firm are still spitting out, and the market is loose. Moreover, the overseas US and Indian cotton markets have turned to a flat and tired route, so buyers are not prosperous. However, Xincheng is supporting the near month and absorbing a lot. As a result, each month fell by 1 angle to 3 and a half angles compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was still flat, but some people collected goods in the near month for arbitrage trading and were firm, while the far month was slightly weaker. As a result, this month rose by 5 points compared with the morning closing price, and the far month fell by 1 angle to 1 and a half angles. It was found that Dafu sold 8,500 dan, Gengfeng 3,400 dan, Ruidai 2,500 dan, Yikang 5,800 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, Tonghe 1,20 dan, Dafeng 3,200 dan, Runkang 3,700 dan, and Xincheng 2,300 dan. Yuanda bought 2,500 dan, Yuanji 8,900 dan, Yangcheng 1,700 dan, Xincheng Qianqi dan, Jinchang 3,100 dan, Hexing 3,800 dan, Ji 1,300 dan, Senkang 1,600 dan, Yichang Qian Zhan, Changhe 2,400 dan, and Changfeng Qian Dan.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and trading was sluggish. The price fell by 2 to 5 pounds due to the bulls taking profits, half for the many merchants, and cotton farmers hedging. Later, the news from Liverpool turned better, sellers were scarce, peers bought in, and empty accounts were offset, and it was slightly better. It was reported that Johnston did not comment on the rumors that the cotton hoarding office was selling January cotton. The market in the afternoon was mixed, peers bought in the near term at limit prices, cotton farmers hedged in the distant month, and spot footings were very firm. Textile products are becoming more and more active, and the closing is stable. It is estimated that the spot price is unchanged, the futures near month rose by 2 to 4 pounds, and the far month fell by 1 to 7 pounds. British cotton spot rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 1 point. A small number of European exporters and speculators bought in Indian cotton, and the market was stable. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by half a rupee, Aomula rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupee, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (19th telegram):</p>

<h3 id="e178">Grain Prices: Flour and Wheat Both Show Weakness <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The flour market opened this morning with prices and market sentiment appearing stable. Prices for foreign wheat were quoted with Chicago wheat being slightly higher by one and a fraction of a cent, and Canadian wheat slightly lower by one cent or so. Market sentiment had already become moderate. There was a small amount of business from out-of-town merchants this month, but there was also quite a lot of hedging in the market, so new demand was relatively reduced. As for the forward months, initially outsiders were quite active in buying, with prices close to those quoted, but then profit-taking by the bulls caused prices to fall back to break even. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading became quiet, with small price fluctuations. As there was very little activity from out-of-town merchants recently, the Nanyang merchants modestly resumed their purchases for the forward months, and the trend became generally weak. Compared to the closing prices of the previous day, nearby months were down by a little over two tenths of a cent, and the distant months were down by more than one cent.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened this morning with very little trading in all months. Only December and March saw any bids, and the rest were empty bids. This was because of the scarcity of chips and high market values, making it difficult for both buyers and sellers to act. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading remained sluggish, and prices showed a slight weakening. This was because the flour market was slightly soft, making it even harder for buyers to be active. Observing the subsequent trend, it appears that the market will hold to a stalemate. The spot wheat market remains stable, with Shandong wheat opening at 4.95 yuan, Guan Dian wheat at 4.94 yuan, Yao Wan wheat at 4.93 yuan, and lower grades at 4.9 yuan, Tiantai wheat at 4.75 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat at 4.79 yuan. Fuxin and Xinda each handled 1,000 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>In the overseas wheat market, the huge supply of Canadian wheat and the imminent arrival of Argentine and Australian wheat are offsetting the supply and demand situation here. Spot and mill markets are quite firm. It is said that the sandstorms in the southwest are not of much concern, and short covering in December futures is having a stabilizing effect.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Xiang rice remained brisk. In addition to rice from the Yangtze River area and Zhejiang, new Fuzhou rice also arrived, with some shipments coming early and some late. However, due to persistent rumors in the market recently, Northern merchants have mostly taken a wait-and-see attitude, and local hoarders are also reluctant to trade freely. Moreover, with ample supplies of river rice arriving, sales are slow and prices are falling, so Xiang rice is being affected. Today, the total transaction volume for the entire city was less than 3,000 bags, all of which were handled by local merchants, and prices were quietly reduced by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Imported rice is scarce. One hundred bags of Saigon No. 1 were offered, and prices remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e180">River Rice Sales Stagnant, Prices Fall Frequently <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, a total of over seventy sources arrived (totaling more than 15,000 shi). The market situation is sluggish due to economic factors and is difficult to revive. Therefore, native rice is declining. As a result, the price of thick early rice and other japonica varieties fell by another 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Although Jin, Qingdao, and Yantai merchants continued to handle 3,000 bags of thin rice, the market is still eating into the supply and is not loosening, with prices being sharply reduced by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Due to the scarcity of Du Yangjian rice, prices are slightly lower by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Yin Bian Yuan rice sales have decreased due to the suspension of purchases by liquor merchants, with only restaurants making minor purchases, causing prices to fall by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, forty-six or forty-seven sources of river rice arrived. The market for japonica rice remained flat in the morning. Prices for upper and middle-grade rice fell slightly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, while prices for middle and lower-grade rice remained stable. Retail sales of Gong Yangjian rice turned around, and prices stabilized in the morning market and tightened by several points in the afternoon market, with port prices remaining steady. Early thin rice prices fell slightly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and Bai Yuan rice fell by about 0.2 yuan. The remaining varieties were slightly soft.</p>

<p>Spot raw hemp is selling well as foreign firms are actively seeking clean goods. The market is booming, and yesterday the price of Zhuzhen hemp reached 9.00 yuan. Secondary grades of Chang Ma also reached 8.60 to 8.70 yuan, which is more than 0.5 yuan higher than the same day last week. Yesterday, the total transaction volume for various hemp was 1,600 to 1,700 bags. Due to the lack of response to the telegraph regarding the price of 12.30 yuan for foreign clean hemp the day before, no transactions were made. A large transaction could be made between 12.10 and 12.20 yuan. Soybean prices continued to increase by 0.02 yuan. Factories traded two cars of Bengbu beans. Local Ningbo firms purchased 800 bags of Hankou Zha beans. Local scattered purchases of more than 270 bags of Pudong beans. Nanyang local firms purchased more than 300 bags of Taicang beans.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had few sales and limited transactions. The guild's quoted prices for 24 coarse white sugar were 22.05 yuan for spot goods and 6.95 yuan for re-export goods, but no transactions were made. The prices for Mian Bai Zhenji No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and No. 5 from the local factory were 21 yuan, 20.70 yuan, 20.40 yuan, 20.20 yuan, and 20 yuan respectively, with little fluctuation. There was even less trading in the sugar industry cooperative's tender offers. For example, only 130 bags of Wuyang Cantonese coarse white sugar, priced at 22.05 yuan for 790 bags, were sold. There was little interest in the remaining 1,000 bags of re-exported Dutch coarse white sugar at 6.95 yuan, 1,490 bags of No. 2 Mian Bai sugar at 21.20 yuan, 1,106 bags of No. 4 sugar at 21 yuan, and 400 bags of secondary No. 2 sugar at 2.55 yuan. Dong Chi and Dong Bai sugars were both offered at the original prices, but no transactions were made. The market is weak and showing signs of loosening.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market became increasingly quiet. European firms have depleted their inventories of high-grade Zhen Mei green tea, and purchases are becoming increasingly cold. Only Tongfu, Tianyu, Huacha, and Fulin and other firms in the city purchased more than 270 boxes of Xia Mu Gong Xi Zhen Mei and other green teas. Selling prices did not fluctuate much. However, firms such as Xiehe Jinjiang have been shipping out more than 8,000 boxes of the green tea that they purchased in the previous few weeks.</p>

<p>The sales of Yuan Qing Zhi Gong Ni are slightly more active in the Guangdong merchant group. Holders of goods are more concerned that the exchange rate will be significantly reduced, and orders will inevitably be cut off. It has been found that the inventory in Shanghai's local and foreign warehouses is not abundant, so the industry has agreed to raise prices. Most have first raised prices by 10%, and it is expected that if sales are strong in the future, prices will be raised again. Yesterday, the price of Dong goods 559 ni has risen, and wholesale prices are 4.30 to 4.40 yuan per yard, which is not enough to meet demand. This is because the cost of imported goods has increased due to the high exchange rate.</p>

<p>The recent trade in Small Guang Pi has been quite good, with merchants from Sichuan, Guangdong, Wenzhou, and Xuzhou all buying in, and local enamel factories and others purchasing goods. Therefore, transactions have been very prosperous. Hot water bottle factories and machine factories have also made allocations. Among the current sluggish goods, this item is selling exceptionally well. It is estimated that there are a total of 500 to 600 dan of goods available, and prices are 0.25 yuan higher than before, with prices estimated at 9.50 yuan per dan. It is said that the cost of this item is very high, and it is expected that prices may rise again in the future. In addition, the trade in Large Guang Pi has not been very good, so not many goods have been offered, and prices have not improved significantly. It is estimated that the maximum price is 9.20 yuan per dan, and the minimum price is 8.75 yuan per dan. It is said that only 30 to 40 dan of goods have been traded in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Raw Material Price Hikes and the National Goods Issue <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency policy, although prices have risen at one point, they have recently been able to return to their original state due to the weakness of purchasing power. However, one of the most painful points for the national goods industry in the past has been the soaring prices of raw materials. These raw material merchants, responding psychologically to the currency reform, believe that it is an excellent opportunity to raise prices, hoard goods and manipulate the market, which puts national goods manufacturers in serious difficulty. Mr. Hu Xiyuan saw this early and earnestly advised raw material merchants not to raise prices too suddenly. The reporter expresses great sympathy. The most difficult thing about rising raw material prices is that it is difficult for small and medium-sized factories. On the one hand, purchasing power has not increased sharply, and they cannot raise selling prices. On the other hand, they have to purchase high-priced raw materials, and the cost suddenly increases. This contradictory environment is indeed the biggest reef for the national goods industry. If this continues, the sales of national goods will inevitably stagnate, and the demand for raw materials will decrease, resulting in a lose-lose situation. Mr. Hu has already expressed his concern. The reporter sincerely hopes that raw material merchants will take a long-term view during this transition period, take the overall situation into consideration, and never embrace selfish and self-interested doctrines, taking the opportunity to profit and sacrificing the lifeblood of national goods. As for national goods manufacturers, they should cooperate sincerely among themselves, unite their peers, purchase raw materials wholesale, and understand the procedures for foreign exchange in order to break the monopoly and deception of middlemen. Then, the difficult environment may have a chance to improve.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Revision of Legal Tender and National Goods <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Bin</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the Ministry of Finance stopped using silver coins and changed the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to legal tender. This was resolutely implemented after research by several economic experts and careful consideration by the financial authorities. There are many benefits. Today, I will briefly describe those related to our national goods industry.</p>
<p>(1) Financial Circulation: In recent years, my country has been affected by the world's economic downturn, coupled with frequent disasters, and the United States has increased the price of silver, and silver is constantly flowing out. Although a countervailing tax is levied, it still cannot be stopped. As a result, my country's silver reserves are decreasing day by day, and the market lacks chips. Although industry and commerce reluctantly survived the four bottoms, seven bottoms, and ten bottoms this year, financial stagnation is becoming increasingly obvious and will inevitably lead to a complete collapse. Now, after the change of legal tender, silver is concentrated, and smuggling can be eliminated. Because silver coins are not in circulation, people will definitely switch to using legal tender. The chips on the market can be increased, and financial circulation will not be as lifeless as before.</p>
<p>(2) Price Increase: In recent years, many national goods factories have been closing down, suspending work, or reducing work due to sluggish sales and inability to turn over funds. After the change to legal tender, various prices have increased considerably, and the rural economy can be revitalized. Then, the sales of national goods can be promoted, and they will not be as lifeless as in the past.</p>
<p>(3) Exchange Control: In recent decades, my country has had trade deficits year after year, and money has flowed out. Even if foreigners do not destroy us politically, the economy is enough to kill us. After the revision of legal tender, international exchange rates are controlled by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. On the one hand, exchange rates can be stabilized and will not rise or fall sharply or be manipulated by others. On the other hand, trade controls can be implemented and import and export trade can be adjusted. Then, our weak national goods industry will not be defeated by international capitalism.</p>
<p>Fellow members of the national goods industry, the country has done its job to protect our declining national goods industry. How should we strive to cooperate closely with the banking industry, keep pace, concentrate talents, reduce costs, manufacture excellent products, produce quickly, and manage scientifically? At this critical moment, it is also the last chance for our national goods industry to recover. I hope you will all strive forward.</p>
<p>My dear patriots, everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. There are no intact eggs under an overturned nest. From today onwards, resolve to use national goods. The country's future depends on it.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The New Life Road of the National Goods Industry <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The economic group's review report of the Fifth National Congress contained a motion that is worth mentioning, that is, the government should earnestly protect the cotton textile industry and eliminate all difficulties. Reducing interest rates on loans and freight is considered to be the key to rescuing the general industry. It is proposed that the congress pass the principle and hand it over to the government to stipulate the statutory interest rate for industrial loans and reduce freight rates, and instruct the competent authorities to handle it. This is the new life road of the national goods industry and the biggest crux of the lack of development of the national goods industry in the past few years. Look at the factories in the East and West. Their only backing is the bank. The interest rate on bank loans has never been as high as what is stipulated in our country. Therefore, for the same factory, their interest is less than half of ours. Since the interest is low, the cost is naturally low. In the competition between the two sides, no matter how hard our country's industry works, it will of course be a failure. I have repeatedly stated this point after returning from a visit to Japan to study industry, and have made every effort to appeal to the national goods industry. However, the government has not promulgated statutory interest rates, so it has not been implemented. I have witnessed the prevalence of high interest rates and the national goods industry's painful burden, and I am often afraid. The industrial decline has reached this point. The method of revival is of course not limited to one, but reducing interest rates has been generally recognized by all insightful people. The economic group of the Fifth National Congress has been able to grasp the key points of rescuing the industry and make fundamental plans. The reporter believes that this is indeed the only new life road for the national goods industry.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Name of National Goods Should Be Corrected <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Confucius said in the Analects: "It must be the rectification of names." It can be seen that the names of things must first be specified. If things do not have a clearly defined name and are just called randomly, over time, they will inevitably be misunderstood and make the public deeply imprint bad impressions. If it is not corrected permanently, it is neither the way to rectify names nor will it be laughed at by foreign countries.</p>
<p>Many of the items in national goods are made in this country, but they are prefixed with the word "foreign," such as foreign fire, foreign candles, foreign umbrellas, foreign soap, etc. There are too many examples to list. These items are not imported, so I don't know why they must be prefixed with the word "foreign." It is really wronged! Moreover, it is too contradictory to the meaning of promoting national goods! In my opinion, the names of these items all need to be corrected as soon as possible. For example, "foreign fire" can be changed to "matches," "foreign umbrellas" can be changed to "sun umbrellas," "foreign soap" can be changed to "soap," and "foreign candles" can be changed to "candles" (if this name is considered inappropriate, it can be changed again). Then, a fixed term for domestic products will be specified, and it will be much better to call it out, and the suspicion of domestic products being falsely labeled with the name "foreign" will be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e192">After Visiting the Improved Family Exhibition <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>The Improved Family Exhibition was held at the Welfare Company on Nanjing Road. The reporter was invited by a national goods factory to visit. Upon entering the door, Chinese and Western men and women were mixed together, and the threshold was almost worn through. There were 78 exhibition rooms, mostly by Western merchants. From the lower floors to the third floor, the arrangement was almost full. The national goods factories that displayed their products were only Wuhe Weaving Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Jinglun Shirt and Socks Factory, and Guanshengyuan. The arrangement was beautiful and took a lot of effort. Wuhe's Goose Brand shirts have long been well-known, almost making people associate white geese with undershirts and cotton wool shirts. The factory specially placed several white geese, and there is no shortage of Wang Xizhi in the world, which must be very interesting. European and American women also inquired about Meiya's silk and the Chemical Industry Society's cosmetics, believing that they could be compared with imported goods and were worth a try. There were even more European and American women and children who attended the exhibition. On Sunday afternoons, it was almost announced that it was full, and even those with tickets felt that there was no way to enter.</p>
<p>This exhibition is not so much about improving family life as it is about improving family life. If families below the middle class do not take into account their own strength and want to admire this extravagant life and fill their desire for enjoyment, there is no other way than to go into debt. However, if you do not learn from their material life but learn from their spiritual life, then hygiene, cleanliness, tidiness, and beauty can be used to attack mistakes.</p>
<p>I believe that for this kind of Improved Family Exhibition, Shanghai's national goods factories may wish to unite with social groups such as the YMCA, the Family Renovation Association, and the Student National Goods Promotion Association to select areas with convenient transportation and spacious locations, collect products from famous factories in Shanghai, and make systematic displays of the necessities of life, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Invite people from all walks of life to attend the meeting and make comments, and carry out publicity and entertainment at the same time. Arrange different programs every day to attract the observation of people from all walks of life. Then, its significance will be greater, its effectiveness will be greater, and its value will be greater. As for the lottery that promotes a lucky mentality and the unpredictable guessing of numbers, it belongs to the gambling and luck of the lower society, and it is a stain on the exhibition. It is very undesirable. When our national goods factories start, they should absolutely avoid it to avoid being criticized by knowledgeable people.</p>
<h3 id="e193">National Goods Displayed in the Family Exhibition <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The International Family Exhibition organized by the foreign firm Millington Advertising Company opened on November 16! The address is the Welfare Company on Sichuan Road, the central business district. The most gratifying thing about this exhibition is that there are actually our exquisite national goods displayed inside. For example, the silk fabrics of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, the candies of Guanshengyuan, the wines of Zhangyu Grape Wine Company, and the wool shirts of Wuhe Weaving Factory… What is especially good at using advertising to promote goods is Wuhe Factory, because its trademark is the famous Goose Brand, it actually used the display of live geese to attract the attention of every visitor—the ingenuity is worthy of everyone's imitation, for example, Sanyou Industrial Society, may wish to display the potted plants of the Three Friends of Winter, pine, bamboo, and plum! Such as candy and grapes, you can use natural science to symbolize the beauty of the product!</p>
<p>National goods are listed in the international community, which is enough to increase the status of our national goods. In the future, when our compatriots abroad go to foreign companies, they will be able to see the national goods of their own motherland, and how happy will they be in their hearts?</p>
<p>Secondly: After our national goods are displayed and exhibited in foreign companies, Western customers will definitely have a very good impression!</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Visit to the Shanghai Cement Factory <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Li Guanghuang</p>
<p>Having previously visited the Shanghai Cement Factory owned by Chinese merchants, I wrote a brief account. Recently, seeing the world situation becoming increasingly urgent, cement, being the foundation of construction and as important as coal and iron as an essential element of modern industry, its production and sales have a tremendous impact on the prosperity and decline of a nation's industry. Therefore, I specially record this for the consideration of my countrymen.</p>
<p>The company's factory is located in the suburbs near Longhua Town in western Shanghai. If you wish to visit, first go to the Shanghai Cement Company at 6 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, to make arrangements with the office. They will designate a date and send someone to provide a tour.</p>
<p>The factory site is located south of the China National Aviation Corporation's airfield. A cinder road has been built to connect to Longhua Town, allowing vehicles to reach the gate directly. The surrounding area is filled with employee residences, forming a distinct town. Upon entering, one must fill out the visitor's book and wait briefly in the reception room. Soon, someone will appear to lead the tour of the various sections. Now, I will describe the cement manufacturing process step by step, which may make it clearer.</p>
<p>Cement is also known as 洋灰 (yáng huī), and in English, it's called Cement. It is also translated as 水門汀 (shuǐ mén tīng) or 士敏土 (shì mǐn tǔ). The main raw materials are limestone and clay, which are abundant in the Yangtze River basin of China. The factory unloads these two raw materials from the riverbank and separately loads them into small carts. The carts are marked with white characters to indicate their contents, and the number of carts is proportional to the quantity of each material. Simultaneously, the carts are driven by machinery along the rails directly into the factory. The carts are made of iron, shaped like buckets, and called transport buckets. Once inside the building, the raw materials are automatically dumped into steel ball mills. The empty buckets then return to the riverbank in a continuous cycle. The stone and clay are mixed and ground finely in the mills and then dropped into continuous kilns for burning. The kilns are shaped like cylinders, quite long, and there are two of them, lying parallel horizontally on the ground. They operate alternately, switching once a day. One end has a tall chimney that rises outside the building, and the other end has an opening to observe the fire, as the burning requires a specific temperature. I found it particularly dazzling to look at, so the guide took a colored glass frame from the side for me to look through, and indeed, it did not hurt the eyes and allowed me to know the temperature of the burning from the different flames. When the kiln fire is sufficient, it must be removed to cool, then ground into powder, and after screening, it becomes cement. It is packed into barrels for shipment. The trademark is an elephant. The daily output is about 1,500 barrels. Because the factory is located on the bank of the Huangpu River, it has its own wharf, making transportation convenient. However, due to the competition from foreign goods on the market, I heard that the sales of this product are greatly affected.</p>
<p>As for the power source for all the machinery in the factory, it comes from a steam turbine, with a voltage of 220V, a current of 4000A per line, and a power of 1500 K.A.V., which is equivalent to about 866 K.W (kilowatts, abbreviated as kW). This is sufficient for the entire factory's operation.</p>
<p>I must also make it clear that photography is prohibited inside the factory. The tour takes about two hours. Seeing this emerging industry in China makes me feel very gratified.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Please Printing Industry Do Your Best to Use National Paper <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yihong</p>
<p>Here are the names of paper mills established by Chinese people and the types of products they produce, based on what I know:</p>
<h3 id="e196">Factory Name <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Product Types</p>
<p>Longzhang: Longzhang Lian Shi Paper, Daolin Paper (This is a new product with excellent quality)</p>
<p>Tianzhang: Daolin Paper, Drawing Paper, Cover Paper (Although the Tianzhang Paper Mill is temporarily suspended, there is still a lot of stock on the market)</p>
<p>Jiangnan: Lian Shi Paper, Mao Bian Paper (There is also a type of Lian Shi Paper that is very sturdy and can be written on with ink pens)</p>
<p>Dazhonghua: Same as above</p>
<p>Senji: Same as above</p>
<p>According to the various types of paper listed in the table above (although newsprint is still being manufactured in China and has not yet been released), they are already very suitable for various printed materials and can replace foreign paper. The price is also cheaper than foreign paper.</p>
<p>It is truly heartbreaking that I know some people in the printing industry and paper users are still indifferent, not paying attention, and not advocating for the use of national paper. Look—general printed materials on the market can very well be printed with national paper, yet they are always using foreign paper. Foreign paper probably accounts for 70-80% of the total.</p>
<p>I know that the following situations may be some of the reasons why printing houses and paper users are not making every effort to use national paper:</p>
<p>1. Relationship between printing houses and paper stores: Printing houses have established relationships with paper stores for the exchange of goods, so it is very convenient for printing houses to obtain paper from these stores. However, some paper stores do not have the specific type of national paper needed, so they can only supply foreign paper. Printing houses are too lazy to find and purchase national paper from other sources. Some printing houses obtain goods from established paper stores, or they do not need to pay in cash; if they were to obtain goods from other sources, they would have to prepare cash. Under these circumstances, printing houses seek ease and convenience and do not use national paper.</p>
<p>2. Paper stores stocking goods: Most paper stores deal in foreign paper, and some have established relationships with foreign companies. The constraints are similar to those mentioned in the previous point. It is somewhat troublesome to stock national paper separately. Therefore, they prefer to promote foreign paper. Perhaps the trade benefits that national paper mills provide to paper stores are not as good as those for foreign paper, so paper stores are not very willing to promote national paper. These two situations are also reasons why national paper cannot sell well.</p>
<p>3. Bad past impressions: In the past, the quality of national paper had not reached the highest level. Printing houses that had used it and were dissatisfied retained a contemptuous view of national paper. Regardless of how much better the current products are compared to the past, they still keep saying how bad national paper is and are unwilling to try and use it again.</p>
<p>4. Cold attitude: It cannot be said that there are not some people with a cold attitude, and even doing perverse things. They believe that they only need to make money themselves. What is the difference between national and foreign paper? What great difference does using national paper make to them? It is absolutely unnecessary for them to use national paper to replace foreign paper. If someone earnestly asks them to try using national paper, they will secretly laugh at them for being "silly." Or they will deliberately say: the price of national paper is too expensive; the quality is too bad; Chinese people cannot make good things, after all, foreign paper is better, and so on. The national paper samples they provide may be old, inferior, and not the latest and better products, and the price is arbitrarily increased. This kind of counter-propaganda, of course, easily diminishes people's enthusiasm for using national paper.</p>
<p>The above are some of the actual situations, based on what I have observed in a limited area. Now, the latest products of national paper have indeed improved a lot compared to the past! They can very well replace foreign paper! Please printing industry and paper users, especially government agencies, banks, companies, etc., when adding printed materials, no matter the size, pay more attention and do your best to use national paper. If you want to know the detailed information of national paper, you can directly go to the offices of the respective paper mills, or various national goods organizations, to inquire about everything and obtain the latest paper samples.</p>

<h3 id="e197">The Development Foundation of Small Newspapers <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>In the process of large newspapers becoming smaller and newspapers and magazines becoming more entertaining, small newspapers suddenly appeared before our readers with a lively posture. The reformed "Times Daily" and the recently published "Li Bao" can be said to be the leaders of this type of small daily newspaper in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Small newspapers are neither the old-fashioned tabloids of the past nor the generally tabloid-ized large newspapers. It is a light, neat, and new posture bear, standing independently among these two—or many kinds of newspapers. In the past, most old-fashioned tabloids focused on piecing together certain anecdotes, strange stories, anecdotes of great men, and romantic affairs of men and women. Its purpose was to provide the general leisure class and bored people with material for after-dinner entertainment. Although one or two newspapers in the past (such as Shanghai Bao, etc.) shifted their vision to analyze current affairs and secrets, the subject matter of anecdotes, anecdotes, and romantic events remained the main characteristic of old-fashioned tabloids.</p>
<p>Although the tabloid-ized large newspapers are not entirely focused on narrating anecdotes of important people and romantic affairs of famous prostitutes like the old-fashioned tabloids, the subjects and focus of their descriptions are still mainly on sports news, male and female events, and other interesting content. Although the purpose of the above two types of newspapers is the same, to attract the general leisure class and certain shop clerks and small businessmen, in our view, they cannot be regarded as small newspapers.</p>
<p>In our view, a so-called small newspaper should at least have the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Accurate and clear, without the cumbersome nature of large newspapers, but with the richness of large newspapers;</p>
<p>2. Simple and economical, so that most people can read it, understand it, and afford it;</p>
<p>3. Able to speak from the standpoint of the interests of the majority, and able to publish a large number of opinions and articles from workers, small shop clerks, and middle school students;</p>
<p>4. Able to educate the public and lead the public with a solemn attitude.</p>
<p>Therefore, under these conditions, it must have concise and incisive editorials, essential and systematic political news, international news, and social news every day. It is best to summarize and condense the generally important political news and international news in an orderly and systematic manner every day, and analyze and dissect it in the most concise style. Occasionally insert current affairs cartoons so that readers can grasp the center of transformation in extremely complex international events, saving themselves from having to understand or explore in a wide range of news. Secondly, it must write articles in an extremely light style. It is best to use simplified characters and frequently publish the works of middle school students, shop clerks, and workers, or describe interesting events related to their daily lives: such as works like "Ye Zhongfang's Confession." At the same time, it is necessary to set up "Youth Mailbox" or "Worker Mailbox" so that the general public has a place to speak, and can solve difficult problems for these majority of readers at any time according to their environment. The last point is that it should publish more reliable political news, social news, and cultural news within a certain possible range, and always remember to fight for the interests of the majority. Therefore, the conditions for the establishment of small newspapers are not only in its simplicity and lightness; but in its ability to approach the public and grasp the public. Because simple and cheap are indeed one of the factors that make a small newspaper a small newspaper; but gaining the support of the public and taking on the task of educating and leading the public is the only foundation for the establishment and development of small newspapers. Without this foundation, small newspapers, even if they are extremely small, cannot exist and develop.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current Chinese news industry, which is using newer methods to approach the vast readership, I believe that if progressive intellectuals can adhere to their claims of approaching the public and educating the public under the oppression of various economic, political, and personnel conditions; constantly maintain their certain attitude and improve the content of their newspapers; then the development foundation of small newspapers will inevitably be consolidated day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The German Book Trade Exchange <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Keming</p>
<p>Due to the economic depression, the publishing industry, like other enterprises, has fallen into extreme panic. Publishers do not want to organize the publishing methods in a sound manner, but only engage in cutthroat competition in business, and the result will naturally be downhill, without any improvement. Here, I would like to introduce to readers and publishers the world's most perfect book distribution organization—the German exchange system.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, the world's most perfect book distribution organization already existed in Leipzig, Germany—that is, the exchange system. The foundation of this was first laid by Germany's three major booksellers: Horvath of Potstan, Campe of Nuremberg, and Voight of Fmenau. The initial address was in Richter's coffee shop, and later moved to the classroom of the seminary. At that time, all booksellers who came to Huabi City used this place as a market. The initiators provided the necessary equipment and items, and then the organization of the exchange began. Until 1836, the organization formally had a fixed building.</p>
<p>Members under the jurisdiction of the organization must abide by the regulations and recognize the traditional habits of the book industry. The book trade exchange, in German, is called Borsenverein. The regulations originally formulated aimed to benefit the book industry to the greatest extent. Not only was it so on the surface, but in fact, the organization had indeed become the most active machine for developing the book industry.</p>
<p>They have a central office for discussing many important business issues. During this period, the most difficult thing for publishers and booksellers was the lack of copyright protection for books. It is interesting and noteworthy that Leipzig's becoming the center of the book industry fifty years ago was partly due to the strict restrictions on private printing of books. As early as 1773, the issuance and sale of privately printed books was officially prohibited in the Leipzig book market. Therefore, publishing a new book in Leipzig was more trustworthy than going to Frankfurt (Leipzig's commercial rival). In addition, the unanimous ban of North German booksellers from entering the Frankfurt market a few years ago made the book industry in Leipzig flourish. Even today, the number of new books published in Berlin is greater than in Leipzig, but Leipzig has always remained the publishing center of the German book industry.</p>
<p>When the book trade exchange began, there were only 108 members, but their efforts increased with each passing year, and today the number of members exceeds 500.</p>
<p>Various advances and improvements have prompted publishers from other parts of Germany to bring funds to Leipzig to seek new life, and the book trade exchange has become increasingly prosperous.</p>
<p>The need for agents came with the development of the market business. At first, only the publishers felt it, and gradually the booksellers also had this need. Now, members of the book trade exchange who do not live in Leipzig, whether publishers or booksellers, all hire an agent. This system has not only made Leipzig the center of book production, but also the center of book distribution!</p>
<p>In the course of gradual progress, the book trade exchange immediately felt the need to issue a commercial newspaper. In 1835, a newspaper called "German Bookselling Industry Exchange Price List" appeared. In 1867, it was changed to a daily publication. The content includes new book advertisements, book descriptions, bookstore reports, trial reading coupons, etc. In this way, there is a close connection between the exchange, publishers, and booksellers every day. Especially for booksellers, they can purchase books step by step without being at a loss, so efficiency and order have been greatly improved.</p>
<p>As a result, there is now a formal gazette that provides a summary description of more than 1,300 organizations related to the German book industry. When a bookstore is discovered, it outlines the type of business, the names of the shareholders, and the agents it employs in a bird's-eye view.</p>
<p>In short, the book trade exchange is a very complex institution, but it represents great success in book distribution methods. The United States imitated it, and there is an organization similar to the Borsenverein in New York, called the Bookseller's Clearing House. Other countries such as England, France, and the Netherlands also tend to follow suit.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, let us assume the procedure for purchasing books to clarify the book trade exchange system.</p>
<p>For example, there is a bookseller in Hamburg who wants to buy books published in Mönchengladbach and Frankfurt. Every bookseller has a form. The format of this form is generally uniform, and the size is no more than three inches long and four inches wide. Now, the original style of this form is copied as follows: (see the form arranged below)</p>
<p>There are ordinary and expedited forms. The latter has a "ten" mark, which needs to be processed urgently. Generally, after receiving it, it will be mailed back on the same day.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to buy a certain book, fill in the name of the publisher in the corner of the form, and fill in the title of the book you want to buy in the blank space. After filling out several forms, the bookseller in Hamburg mails them not to Mönchengladbach and Frankfurt, where the books are published, but to Leipzig. Write the name of the publisher's agent in Leipzig on the envelope. After the agent receives this form, he goes to the office to pack the books the other party needs into a parcel and hands it over to the agent of the Hamburg bookseller in Leipzig. Then take it to the Packet Auctansch Stelle to mail it back to its owner. In theory, after the parcel is paid, the payment for the book must be paid, but there is usually a delay of about a week. Therefore, both parties need a way to keep accounts, just like banks.</p>
<p>After the expedited form is completed, then pay attention to the ordinary form. The process is the same as the above method, and the procedure is only completed after the parcel arrives in the hands of the bookseller's agent, and the book is mailed to its client.</p>
<p>Note (the content in parentheses is English notes)</p>
<p>Using the exchange system to purchase books has the following three advantages:</p>
<p>(1) All booksellers' forms are sent in one envelope to one place (Leipzig).</p>
<p>(2) Booksellers can save the trouble of sending drafts to many publishers, while publishers can avoid recording the procedures for receiving drafts from more than a hundred bookstores or booksellers.</p>
<p>(3) Sending in bulk can also save a lot of postage.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Bookstore Miscellany (Continued) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>Secondly, most new bookstores are facing financial difficulties, forcing them to live within their means. This contradicts the editor-in-chief's publishing plans, often resulting in the editor-in-chief approving manuscripts or even issuing payment slips, while the accounting department under the general manager insists on withholding payment. In the past, incidents of general managers fighting with authors or editors due to this were common. However, there are also many cases where the general manager and publishing are integrated. In those bookstores where the boss also serves as the general manager, naturally there are no problems.</p>
<p>To be frank, the new book industry is still in its pioneering stage, especially now, during this turbulent time. The general manager's responsibility is immense, and the rise and fall of many bookstores depend on the general manager. The general manager often concurrently serves as the sales director, and some even don't have a sales director, leaving all sales matters to be handled solely by the general manager. This has a significant impact on the bookstore's business. Even with good books, without good promotion, books cannot become widely known on their own. Unfortunately, there are still cases of general managers becoming bureaucratic and corrupt in new bookstores. Some general managers engage in "petty trading," such as printing extra copies of easily sold books for their own personal gain, or establishing their own paper mills or printing houses and transacting with the bookstores they manage, ensuring that their bookstores never suffer any losses. Some bookstore general managers embezzle public funds, while others become corrupt, as if becoming a bookstore general manager is like climbing the ladder to officialdom, spending their days mingling in official circles. Some even think they are already great tycoons, so they spend their days booking rooms to play mahjong and summoning servants. Although this may seem like personal matters, how much loss does it cause to the publishing and cultural industries?</p>
<p>(5) Store Employees</p>
<p>The organizational structure of new bookstores varies in size, so the situation of store employees also differs greatly. Larger bookstores have a more complex division of labor, and there are more types of employees. For example, in large bookstores such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company, the division of labor is quite detailed. Even though they are all employees, the nature of their work, from department heads to junior clerks, is completely different. However, at the same time, most new bookstores, such as those lining the Fourth Road, are not large in scale. Therefore, the duties of the so-called store employees are mostly similar. In some cases, the boss, manager, and employee are all the same person (of course, there are also a few separate employees). The status of employees in these family-run bookstores is naturally different from that in large bookstores.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in new bookstores that are neither too large nor too small, store employees are of considerable importance. This is because, in these bookstores, apart from the manager and a few other personnel, it is these store employees who support the entire business. Because their division of labor is not large, their nature is also similar. Moreover, today's new bookstores are mostly of this type, so we can use them as an example to discuss some of the more interesting situations.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the source of store employees. Because the history of new bookstores is still short, there are not many store employees who were completely created to meet the needs of new bookstores. Many bookstore employees are still clerks from old-style bookstores. These people are called "insiders," while others are called "outsiders." This also shows the non-modern nature of the operating methods of new bookstores. However, this is only true for the majority. It is not to say that new bookstores do not have new-style employees. On the contrary, they are gradually developing, and those employees who have transitioned from old-style bookstores are likely to be eliminated.</p>
<p>The power to hire employees lies in the hands of the general manager or manager, so the general manager or manager plays a significant role in the decision of who to hire. Because most new bookstores have not yet embarked on the path of modern organization, "feudal" factors are still significant. This is reflected in the hiring of employees through the referral of fellow villagers and relatives. You see, even in the Kaifeng Bookstore, are not most of the employees from Shaoxing? In the Modern Bookstore during the Hong Xuefan era, were not most of the employees from Ningbo? Furthermore, in smaller new bookstores, it goes without saying that many employees are said to be related to the Li family.</p>
<p>Even more backward than this situation is the existence of the apprenticeship system. In many bookstores, most of the employees are apprentices, and in some cases, all of them are apprentices. This is a major misunderstanding on the part of new bookstore operators. They believe that the book industry is the same as other retail businesses and can use "cheap and easily controlled" apprentices to handle all duties. As a result, most of the store employees in new bookstores are half-baked, and some cannot even read many words. When you walk into these bookstores, not only do the employees not know how to serve you, but sometimes when you ask them if they have a certain type of book, they will bring you a completely opposite book. If you specifically ask them for a certain book, even if the book is right in front of them, they will stare blankly and not know what to do, and may even say that they don't have it. How can such people develop the new book industry? It is truly difficult.</p>
<p>It seems that in order to adapt to the times, various bookstores once competed to hire female store employees. In Japan, almost all of the employees in large bookstores such as Maruzen and Sanseido are female (most of the male employees are in higher-level command positions), and their abilities are mostly stronger than those of Chinese male employees. For example, if you ask them for the complete works of Tolstoy, they will go on to recommend the complete works of Dostoevsky, etc. They will definitely know where every book in their store is located. Sometimes, if they don't have the book, they will even tell you where you can buy it. However, in China, female employees are generally still referred to as mere decorations, even in bookstores, which are cultural enterprises. The first bookstore to hire female store employees was the Beauty Bookstore founded by Dr. Zhang Jingsheng. The female store employees there seemed to only know Dr. Zhang's few major works, making bookworms feel like country bumpkins entering a dance hall when they entered the Beauty Bookstore. Later, the trend of hiring female employees in various industries in Shanghai became more open, and people were less curious about female store employees in bookstores. However, according to my personal opinion, it seems that the abilities of female store employees in general are still not very good, and they still seem to be somewhat of a decoration. When the Daitong Bookstore completed the construction of its new sales department, there were many female employees in various departments. These female employees seemed somewhat reluctant to interact with customers. As the prosperity of the Daitong Bookstore faded, the female employees, like vases, soon disappeared. When the Modern Bookstore expanded its sales department, it also had a group of "beautiful" female employees. Some poor friends who wanted to go inside to browse through literary books ended up backing away. Sometimes, when customers made purchases from them, several female employees showed a kind of shyness. Like the Daitong Bookstore, the female employees of the Modern Bookstore soon disappeared as well. This further shows that female store employees seem to be a kind of decoration for bookstores when they are wealthy. Nowadays, not many bookstores hire female store employees, and the abilities of female store employees have not increased either. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e200">Politicians' Promises <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The British general election for the Lower House was held on the 14th. In the preceding days, the campaign was very intense. Judging by the situation, this election is particularly unfavorable to the government. The Labor Party's power is quite strong in various industrial areas. Cabinet ministers who are candidates in industrial areas are in a very awkward position. In particular, Privy Councilor MacDonald, the leader of the National Labor Party, is unable to gain people's trust. When MacDonald recently delivered a campaign speech in the West Ham port miners' area, disturbances frequently occurred at the venue, causing him to retreat before finishing his speech. There were even those who shouted at MacDonald when he left the venue. MacDonald was elected as a Member of Parliament by the miners of the West Ham district. The reason why he is not trusted this time is that none of the promises MacDonald made have been fulfilled. On international issues, military issues, and tariff issues, MacDonald went back on his word. On the wage issue and the means test issue, which are most needed by the people, MacDonald made various promises beforehand, but none of them were fulfilled afterward. Therefore, it is no wonder that the miners collectively criticized MacDonald for his current offer of various promises, and no longer trusted him.</p>
<p>What enables a politician (and political parties) to gain people's trust is not how pleasant their promises sound before taking office, but their ability to fulfill their promises after taking office. No matter how many sweet words a politician says to the people during the election campaign, if they go back on their word after gaining the support of the people, they will immediately lose the trust of the people. MacDonald is the best example. MacDonald was deeply supported by the West Ham miners in the previous election, but this time he was criticized because he failed to fulfill his previous promises. Xingwei, the candidate running against MacDonald in the West Ham district, said that he reaps what he sows, which is quite correct. Although the people may be fooled for a while, how can they be deceived afterward? Once you take office, your true colors will be revealed. Not only will you forget your previous oaths, but you will also leave the promises you made to the people behind. As a result, you will lose all public support. The people will scold you and complain about you. Some who cannot bear it will overthrow you. It can be seen that a politician's promises should not be made lightly unless they are made in good faith. Under the watchful eyes of all, you cannot escape the people's supervision.</p>

<p>— Jiang Dejing</p>
<p>Those undulating memories, like a small brown worm, as soon as there is a moment of tranquility in my heart, slowly crawl up, crawling to the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>The fleeting years, carrying those vague past events, seem to be in a fog, gradually drifting away, drifting away, leaving only some vague shadows. I want these shadows to report how the fleeting years are so heartbreaking, I want to get rid of them, but that little brown worm brings them slowly crawling up to my heart again.</p>
<p>That little worm uses her delicate claws to hook the strings of my heart, playing very subtle music. I bow my head and use all my strength to understand its rhythm - so low, telling its aspirations and fantasies, hopes and nostalgia. The joy of the past is just the setting sun on the top of the mountain, covering the whole world with beautiful colors for a moment. But it easily sinks into the night, that terrible night; all are cold-eyed stars, twinkling, laughing at each other.</p>
<p>I wander, listening to such a mournful music, but I can no longer listen to it, it will make me shed tears. I want to stand on the high ridge of Wanren, howl at the boundless sky, cut through the jade-like long sky, and fly to the world after the sky. There, there are no fleeting years; the little brown worm will never crawl up to my heart.</p>

<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<p>The five goddesses, since they refined the five-colored stones, repaired the missing part of the sky, created the sun, and drove away the "darkness", they played silent music in this beautiful world. I don’t know how many years have passed, and they are hard to remember. Just look at the moon, which is round and missing, and then missing and round again. (II)</p>

<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>This has always been a warm pavilion, on the side of the flower hall. Thick velvet curtains covered the window, and there was no light in the side alley behind it, so the warm pavilion was extremely dark. In summer, this room is locked up. In winter, the master and madam spread a smoking set on the mandarin duck couch, and the two of them stayed in seclusion inside all day long. The master was a tall, thin man, holding only a water pipe at this time, wandering in front of the couch. The area of the warm pavilion was not two fathoms wide, and the mandarin duck couch almost occupied one-third of the space. With the addition of the tea table and backrests, there were only a few square feet of space left in front of the couch. Therefore, the master could not swagger and pace around like he did in the flower hall. He almost walked three steps with his heels touching his toes, and then had to turn around. However, his attention was now completely focused on his daughter. A paper match was about to burn his fingertips, but he had not taken a puff of smoke, and he had walked back and forth so naturally. The madam, on the other hand, was a tall, fat, middle-aged woman whose weight increased every day. She lay on the upper part of the mandarin duck couch, smoking, looking like a pile of cotton batting, or a large piece of luggage brought back from a long journey. The madam was tall and fat even before she got married, and now she dared not easily say the word "fat". She found it quite difficult to turn around to smoke, so usually the master would do the work at the lower end of the couch, and the madam only had to bring the mouthpiece to her lips and close her eyes to take a refreshing puff. Today, after arguing with the master, she was unwilling to admit defeat. Since the master refused to help, she had no choice but to do it herself. But before she could finish smoking a pipe, the pile of cotton batting was already like an engine in rapid progress.</p>
<p>The paper match in the master's hand burned his finger, and he suddenly woke up, stopped wandering, and rushed to his wife's ear, questioning, "What are we going to do about this matter?"</p>
<p>The madam had not had enough pleasure, and could not support her body, which weighed more than twice that of the master, on its side. She used all her strength to push the smoking set away, and rolled her body to face the ceiling, finally breathing a sigh of relief:</p>
<p>"The daughter is not raised by me alone, what a joke!" After saying that, she felt that her tone was too soft, and suddenly sat up from the mandarin duck couch. Because the master was unprepared, she almost bumped into him head-on. She then said to the master's face: "Ask you, the father! If you don't raise and teach her, it's the father's fault. You still have the face to ask me, how can you ask that! You old..." She couldn't find a suitable name for a moment, because crude and vulgar curses would ultimately cause her to lose her "madam" status, so she stopped and lay back down, breathing two comfortable breaths.</p>
<p>"If you don't raise and teach her, it's the father's fault?" The master interjected; "I've read so many books, but I'm not as good as you. If you don't raise and teach her, it's the father's fault? With you, this mother, standing in front of me, is there still a father? Now that she's done this shameless thing, you're thinking of If you don't raise and teach her, it's the father's fault!"</p>
<p>The master took out another paper match from the smoking set, lit it with the dim green flame of the lamp, and sat down on the lower part of the mandarin duck couch to smoke the water pipe. The madam rolled over to face the master, but couldn't think of anything to retort, so she yawned, dragged the smoking set closer, and started smoking.</p>
<p>At this moment, the young servant who was in charge of the warm pavilion poked his head in - perhaps he had been standing outside the pavilion for a long time, listening to the couple's argument - and reported softly: "Uncle!"</p>
<p>The master waved his paper match: "Tell him I'm not seeing guests."</p>
<p>The madam, however, seized the master's mistake and said, "Not seeing guests? What kind of important official are you pretending to be! He's my brother, and I want to see him! Afu, please ask the uncle to come in." The madam wanted to turn around, but the opium suddenly flared up on the lamp.</p>
<p>Afu's body had just retreated, and the uncle had already stepped into the warm pavilion. He made a deep bow to his sister's husband, and the master had no choice but to put down the water pipe and return the bow, taking the opportunity to give the guest the lower seat and retreating to sit on the backrest in front of the window.</p>
<p>"Brother," The madam had an extra helper. Although she had not had enough pleasure, her voice naturally became rougher: "You be the judge for me: You came to propose marriage for Xiaofeng, but he wouldn't agree no matter what. In fact, such a family would not disgrace your official position; now that Xiaofeng has escaped, uh, left, it's my fault again. Brother, you be the judge for me!" The madam, still angry, pointed her finger at the master from a distance.</p>
<p>The uncle first gave a burst of laughter: "I came after hearing the news. Now is not the time to delay. We should find Xiaofeng back first. Brother-in-law, what do you think?" He thought for a moment: "Although this is not something unclean, it is still your face, brother-in-law, if the news spreads." The uncle said, word by word, with a chuckle, waiting for his brother-in-law's reply.</p>
<p>The brother-in-law raised his head, without interjecting. The madam, however, said: "What's the use of saying more? The daughter is not raised by me alone, let her go!"</p>
<p>"Sister, don't add fuel to the fire!" The uncle put on a serious face, "This is a man's business, and brother-in-law will always think of a solution slowly; however, now is not the time to delay..." He stood up from the mandarin duck couch and slowly walked to the window.</p>
<p>The brother-in-law seemed embarrassed to continue being cold, "Do as you see fit! I'll pretend I didn't raise this daughter!" Saying that, he left the warm pavilion on his own.</p>
<p>The uncle followed him to the entrance of the warm pavilion, saw his brother-in-law's shadow enter the flower hall, turned around and stuck his tongue out at his sister: "Then it's easy to handle, leave it to me, your uncle." He patted his chest with his right hand.</p>
<p>"This old ghost never agrees with me!" The madam smiled victoriously, wriggling her bloated body and saying to the uncle, "Brother, lie down for a while!"</p>
<h3 id="e204">A Visit to Xuanwu Lake <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongshuo</p>
<p>Leaving Xuanwu Gate, that straight road, tightly wrapped in green willows, seemed even more magnificent and full of vigor.</p>
<p>I have a bit of an eccentricity. I have never been very fond of being blindly fashionable. It's the same when I look at scenery. No matter whether the places that people praise and admire are historical sites or scenic spots, I seem to regard them with indifference and remain unmoved. This kind of unsociable narrow-mindedness may be due to heredity, but it is also partly due to my deeper involvement in the world. For example, when I was in Hangzhou a few years ago, I gathered a few friends to visit Liulang Wenying and Quyuan Fenghe because I was shocked by their names. Before I went, I always thought that these places must be extraordinary, but the result was a disappointing return.</p>
<p>But this time I visited Xuanwu, and I felt very happy. It's been almost half a year since I came to Nanjing. Apart from going to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum out of necessity, it can be said that I haven't left my house. Xuanwu Lake is naturally the first time I've visited it.</p>
<p>It is said that the beauty of Xuanwu Lake lies in the lotus flowers all over the lake. However, at this moment, not only have the lotus flowers long since withered, but even the lotus leaves have turned yellow and died.</p>
<p>Although the lotus flowers have withered and the lotus leaves have died, Xuanwu in the late autumn has a desolate and poignant beauty. I remember someone comparing the West Lake in spring to a plump woman, then Xuanwu in late autumn should be a petite, dignified, and rather serious girl.</p>
<p>It was a holiday weekend. There was a shower in the morning, and although the rain stopped in the afternoon, the sky was still gloomy and depressing. However, the number of tourists did not decrease due to the cloudy weather.</p>
<p>We chose a place where we could both enjoy the scenery and avoid the cold wind, and we began to talk without any purpose.</p>
<p>"In fact, the beauty of Xuanwu lies in the fact that it has the name of a lake but not the reality of a lake. You say it is a lake, but it does not have the conditions that a lake must have. When you step into Xuanwu Gate, all you see are a few patches of shallow water mixed in with withered lotus flowers. You simply can't find any traces of a lake. Everyone knows that the most important condition for constituting a lake is water. Those few patches of shallow water in Xuanwu Lake really can't meet the name of a lake, but its beauty lies in this point. If Xuanwu was a reservoir lake with green water, then the graceful beauty would not exist."</p>
<p>The above is a discussion by Lao Yu. To avoid disputes, we all remained silent, because we all knew that Lao Yu's personality was very strong.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, the characteristic of Xuanwu is not in the lake itself, but in the background that constitutes its characteristics, such as the majestic and beautiful mountain scenery, the ancient and mottled city walls, and the withered branches and leaves all over the lake, which together create this intricate scenery woven by man and nature.</p>
<p>If you haven't visited Xuanwu Lake, you will never feel the greatness of the Nanjing city walls. That winding giant wall stands there so somber and solemnly, adding a lot of color to this famous lake!</p>
<p>Some people say that Xuanwu Lake is a bit like Beihai in the ancient capital. In the late summer and early autumn, the beautiful lotus flowers and the green lotus leaves all have the characteristics of Beihai. Unfortunately, at this moment, the lotus flowers are withered and decayed, so I can't compare Beihai and Xuanwu. This may not be a lack of my visit to Xuanwu Lake this time.</p>
<p>Xuanwu Lake has one more advantage than Beihai. That is to say, Beihai has lost too much artificiality, while Xuanwu has a lot of natural beauty.</p>
<p>We rested for a while in "Asia Park", and then we finished visiting "Europe", "America" and "Philippine" continents. We didn't go to "Australia", which is far away in the water, in order to save trouble and avoid trekking.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Jia Baoyu Visits Xiaoxiang Pavilion at Night"</p>
<p>The severe winter chill freezes into ice. The moonlight is hazy, the soul about to break. Gusts of north wind penetrate the bones. The black and cavernous Grand View Garden is cold and deserted. Baoyu walks along Flower Street. The night is late, and no sound is heard. He is carrying a lamp, all alone. Dark shadows flicker before him. He goes alone to Xiaoxiang Pavilion. To see if Miss Lin's illness has lessened. He gently knocks on the copper ring, tapping lightly. Will someone quickly come and open the door? Zijuan hears. She asks. Is it the Second Master Baoyu wanting to enter? She hastily opens the door. Please be careful, the cold of the deep night shows no mercy. Thank you, Sister, for your concern. I will never forget your great kindness. It is only because I am worried about your Miss Lin. That is why I have come in the quiet of the night. He has arrived by the bedside. Seeing her, gasping for breath, tears streaming down her face. One calls out "Sister Lin." The other calls out "Cousin." Her almond eyes open slightly, unable to see clearly, "Cousin, your Second Sister-in-law treats me too harshly. Her words are wild, confusing right and wrong. Although Grandmother loves me dearly. Alas, I cannot go to pay my respects." "You and I, the debts of a past life are being settled in this life. Please do not look at this ill-fated person." "Sister, put aside all your worries. Do not take things too lightly. I advise you to eat three meals a day. Add clothes to keep warm. I advise you to sleep early at night. Drink more soup and supplements. I advise you, do not listen to what your sisters say. They are, like half-true, half-jesting. I advise you, take care of your body and mind, and take care. Do not think about the old home in Yangzhou." Hearing these words. Tears stream down. The fated enemy is most attentive to me. "Cousin, please return early to Yi Hong Yuan. Tears soak the fragrant silk handkerchief." "This body may not be too adrift."</p>

<p>The "Fudan Drama Society," a school drama group with a long history, is currently actively rehearsing "Thunderstorm." The director is Ouyang Yuqian.</p>
<p>"Thunderstorm" is a work by Mr. Cao Yu, which was published in "Literary Quarterly." It is said that there were problems when students put it on stage that day. Now that Fudan is putting it on stage, we hope to see a perfect work.</p>

<p>A group of declining movie stars, led by Ma Loufen, will reportedly "open a pier" to Nanyang at the end of this year. Because the words "movie star" can still be sold for some money in Nanyang.</p>
<p>As for the candidates, there are Xu Qinfang, Chen Kenran and his wife, Xia Peizhen and Ma Loufen.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Xu Zhenfang and his wife's trip to Nanyang also has the mission of filming martial arts films, because there is no censorship association there, and the general audience is always inferior, so martial arts films can still sell money.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Realistic Picture in "Boatman's House" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Foreign goods are transported to China in large quantities, and all Chinese industries are stagnant! Judging from cotton yarn alone, the annual imports are always more than hundreds of thousands of tons. In this way, Chinese factories can only close down, and where will a large number of workers go to eat? So all kinds of cruel labor-capital struggles are placed before our eyes, and the news of families losing their jobs and starving to death has also been seen by us. There are still many more cruel things that we cannot easily see, and there are more than we can imagine.</p>
<p>Gao Gufei encountered such cruel things in "Boatman's Daughter." That day, his factory suddenly stopped work. In order to eat, he had to gather all the workers for a meeting to demand that the factory resume work. At the gate of the factory, they shouted loudly: "We all have families, what should we do in the future?</p>
<p>"We will have no food tomorrow, we can't starve to death, can we?"</p>
<p>The veins on Gao Zhanfei's head were popping out, and the roaring sound made the blood vessels of the onlookers boil. Friends, this is a very realistic picture.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Yangtze River Drama Society Established <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Liu Tan, who has been silent for a long time, seems to be active again recently. The drama societies are staging one after another, and the amateur actors' "Nora" and "The Government Inspector" have won the support of a wide audience, showing the unlimited future of the Chinese drama world. In order to love drama, in order to establish the Chinese drama world more firmly, more than 20 amateur actors including Wang Limin and He Kangli initiated a Yangtze River Drama Society. There was such a proposal a few months ago. The initiators were busy with the public performances of "Nora" and "The Government Inspector", so they were delayed. At the same time, they realized from the response of this public performance that the current drama seats were still too aristocratic. They must make it more popular and more universal within the possible scope, so that everyone can see more noble dramas at the lowest price. Now, after several meetings, the Yangtze River Drama Society has announced its establishment, and has decided to choose one of the two plays "The Tragedy of Lan Gu's Marriage" and "The Hypocrite" for the first public performance. The director has also been decided to be Shen Xiling, one of the directors of "The Government Inspector".</p>
