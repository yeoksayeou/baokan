<p>時評</p>
<h3>暹羅政變與其對華僑之壓迫</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>暹羅自一九三二年六月革命以來。巳二年有半。於此期間。時局雖安然過去。然因革命而引起之波瀾。則已有數度。如一九三三年六月二十日。陸軍大臣巴何耳。乘國王出國之機會。造成二度政變。集大權於一身。至是年冬。左翼政治領袖泊洛迪歸國。另謀舉事。一時亦有數日之騷亂。及至去冬十月間。現任首相巴何耳於國會中通過限制國王對於死刑特赦權之法案。於是國王與現政府間之衝突。遂吿緊張。是時暹王在英。卽表示暹當局若堅持此案。則彼不惜放棄王位。其後暹羅當局雖曾派代表至英。勸王勿萌退志。但卒無效果。今王竟以遜位聞。此當爲首次革命以來之一大波瀾矣。</p>
<p>遜王早歲受英國教育。故頗受英國政治思想之影饗。當一九三二年暹羅革命之際。王於民黨中人頗予優容。而民黨所提出之憲法。王亦卽予批准。毫不遲疑。是其對於此一革命。固深表同情者也。卽巴何耳舉行二度政變。王亦未加反對。可見暹王固非專制怙權者流。至去年年暹當局限制暹王死刑特赦權後。王始憤懣。至以去就爭持。考此法案之內容。規定凡罪犯受死刑之宣吿後。於六十日內。得請求國王特赦。王若得首相之副署。可行使特赦權。唯過此期限。國王縱欲特赦。亦無能爲力。此其用意。顯在移國王特赦之權於首相。不言而喻。自此而後。首相挾有生殺之權。威望自必大增。設欲濫用權力。誅鋤異已。亦必甚易。故暹王對此。認爲剝奪其保護人民生命之特權。王位可犧牲。而此種特權斷不容放棄。且主張以此法案付之人民公决。謂彼之特權　可付之人民。特不能付之少數個人與政黨。可知暹王之心目中。固以民意爲重也。據最近歐洲電訊。暹王所提之復位條件。亦皆爲民主政治所不可或缺之要件。以一君主之地位而有如許之民主精神。此不能不謂爲難能可貴也。暹羅失此開明之君主。當然爲一種損失。第是否不因此而醞釀他變。吾人固不必關心。吾人所不能已於言者。卽自暹羅革命以來。對我華僑之壓迫耳。　據本報暹羅通信。暹羅當局於此二年以來。對我華僑之壓迫。實屬駭人聽聞。如最初則勒令華僑學校一律教授暹文。每週至二十一小時之多。同時限制授課總時間不得超過二十八小時。是除暹文以外僅餘七小時。以授其他一切課目。勢必使人更無教授本國文之餘暇與機會。第二步則限制華文教員。必須以精通暹文者爲限。最近更迫令七歲至十四歲之華童。一律轉入暹人學校。且我國輸往彼邦之刊物。亦懸爲厲禁不使我華僑寓自。集會不得自由。國慶不得紀念。究其所爲無一不在迫我華僑忘其祖國。而與暹羅同化也。按暹羅者。撣人之苗裔也。本居於我國長江以南。以漢族勢力向南發展而運入馬來半島。至今其文字雖以婆羅門字母拼音。然實質上多與我國語言同類。其最著者。卽基本數字及名字。大抵與我相同。惟入馬來半島後與印度文明接觸。未能全爲我所同化耳。我國自明而後。國人前往暹羅者。日益增加至今暹人血中。漢族成分。佔至百分之六十以上。故衡諸情理卽謂今之暹羅。不啻我之子國。亦無不可。乃彼數典忘祖。竟欲同化我之僑胞。無乃太過且我國在暹羅之僑胞。縱不以僑民論。亦當以少數民族論。按諸今日國際慣例。少數民族得享文化上之自由。幾若天經地義。遝羅當周。何能如此蔑　　視我僑民應有之權利。此吾人於感慨之餘。甚望其能自動改善。而我政府當局有保護人民之責。亦不容忽視也。</p>

<h3>暹羅強迫僑胞同化</h3>
<p>（暹羅通信）</p>
<p>華人學校每週須授暹文廿一小時　凡滿七歲至十四歲兒童須入暹校</p>
<p>當我提筆寫這篇通信時、熱淚禁不住擁上眼眶、悲痛欲絕、因爲我們華僑子弟今後將陷於暹化而不復了、</p>
<p>前年暹羅政府藉口強迫教育、勒令華校每週授暹文二十五小時、否則不得收容十歲至十四歲的學童、當時我們華僑曾向還政府請願、向國內呼籲、結果他們還是不准、後來美國人所辦的易三振學校也請求、方始答應減少暹文鐘點、但一星期仍須上足二十一小時十五分的暹文、並且每週上課時間、不得超過二十八小時四十五分、僅餘七時半可以教中文、有的學校還要教些英文、如何足够、因此我們不得不再請求、但結果竟被嚴詞拒絕了、當時我們所爭到的、只是「凡遵行強迫教育的學校、華文教員得免試暹文、」但去年他們變本加厲、不但一反前言、華文教員仍須考試暹文、及格始淮上課、並且還派人四出秘密調查、一有所籍口、立卽封閉、永遠不得復辦、數日間各地被封的學校達三四十所之多、南部一帶、幾乎無華僑的學校存在了、數千華童、均被迫入暹校、專讀暹文、將來的結果、决不是我們所忍言的、豈不令人痛心呢、至於其餘的華校、也危在旦夕、隨時都有被封閉的可能、只要他們有所藉口、就得執行、譬如前天有一位暹文教員因病吿假、華文教員到教室裏去維持秩序、給他們知道、便加上你一個違背條例、多授華文的罪名、予以封閉、講到華文教員考試暹文、和請求註冊的事、更是一言難盡、凡欲註冊爲華文教員的、必須先往政府考試遝文、要物色一位教員、暹文及格而有教學的經騐、有的尙項諸習英語、豈非難事、所以師資問題極感缺乏、暹政府的考試、很是嚴格、甚至故意留難、有的一考再考、好久不得要領、凡京外各縣、考卷須呈交曼谷教育部批核、擱下三四個月、是件極平常的事、考試未及格之前、便不得請求註冊、註冊是比考試更爲麻煩的事、須將照片·履歷·文憑·介紹書·自薦信·保單等、運同董事部的請求書、一併呈繳教育部審核、文件倘非暹文、尙項附入暹文譯文、同時又須繳交暹幣四銖、（每銖合國幣一元三四角）向縣政府領取戶籍瞪明書一紙、倘政府對他不滿、便可不發瞪明書、而註冊也便無望了、就是一切都弄妥了、要等教育部批准、也是遙遙無期、在註冊未准之前、不得擅自上課、否則學校便遭封閉、華僑學校旣然到了這樣一個日暮途窮的地步、在理壓迫也可以就此終止了、然而不然、壓迫祇有一步一步的加緊、華校依舊連續地被封閉、最近索性不許華校收容七歲至十四歲的見童了、在校兒童、凡滿七歲至十四歲的、一律勒令退學、轉入暹校、專授暹文、不得更習華文、京外各縣均已被迫實行、你想、七歲至十四歲的　　學生完全被迫退學了、再開什麼學校呢、卽不被封、自然也將自行閉歇了、我們的兒童、尙有學習華文的機會嗎、我們的兒童、尙能有祖國的觀念嗎、不出二十年、華文華語將不見於暹羅了、這不是一件嚴重的事嗎、</p>
<p>或者有人要說、華校被迫停辦後、我們可以令子弟在家自修、不必給他去讀暹文、比較任其同化爲佳、但是像這樣的家長能有幾人、況且小孩子是不會自修的、暹政府爲要壓迫我們的兒童同化、他更規定、如有子弟而不令入學讀滿暹文六年、（女孩四年）經考試及格者、便作犯法論、初則罰欵五十铢、監禁五天、繼則加倍重罰、倘兒童自己不願讀暹文、也以犯法論、這有什麼辦法呢、</p>
<p>我們所受的種種壓迫、自然決不止此、例如照移民律、我們若初次進暹羅、須經　字考試、繳納百餘銖的稅項、不滿二十歲的、一定須由父母率領、始准入口、我們居留於此的、倘欲　國一次、又須繳納回境稅二十銖、限期一年、逾期作新客論、便須受上述的移民律的限制、我們的子弟、滿二十歲便須被迫入伍、服兵役三年、我們的自由、已被剝奪　　了、譬如</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>我們閱讀了國內的刊物、如報紙等、卽有被拘或被罰之虞、我們不得集會結社、甚至不得多與人敘談、我們的紀念日、須先得政府准許、始可升旗、我們不能太熱心公益、如辦華僑學校和捐欵回國等、否則便將博得共產黨的罪名、此外苛捐雜稅、更是五花八門、什麽助政費（每年六銖）咧、所得稅咧、遺產稅咧、……盡量的搜括壓榨、現在我們的兒童、又將全數被迫同化、使他們失掉祖國的觀念、</p>
<p>再有一件事、是我們不能忘掉的、去年密洞華僑、被他們任意格殺、多至百餘人、因而流離失所、財產喪失的、更不可勝歡、現在還有數十名、蒙「莫須有」的罪名、關在監獄裏、這件事情的眞相、我們在暹羅的尙弄不淸楚、但暹政府宣傳我們造反的話、决不是我們所能相信的、親愛的同胞們、可憐我們這輩墮刦的暹羅華僑吧、爲我們一致聲援、爲我們催促政府積極交涉、救救我們的兒童、</p>
<h3>英法協定與德意志　（法國通信）</h3>
<p>德國除在海上建造了袖珍軍艦之外、航空飛機的發達也并不後人、德國的飛機表面上都是些載客的商用飛機、好像與軍事無關、但是將客座一部分加以改造、立刻就可變作軍用機、這一類載客機爲數竟有一千三百多架、魯字特、漢薩航空公司、其內部組織、差不多與法國航空部是一樣、很能發揮其特有的效率、空軍軍用材料的輸入每年不下一千五百萬馬克、瓦爾蒙德交通飛行學校、實際上就是一個空軍將校養成所、德國的航空路綫祇有一萬八千六百四十公里、可是她的飛行成績却有一百二十一萬九千公里、比法國多二十八萬八千公里、</p>
<p>據法國方面某專門家的考察、以爲德國的戰鬥機、爆炸機、都非常的新式、可以稱作空中的巡洋艦、爆炸機四百架、各載炸彈約及三噸、可以向敵方投下四百五十噸以至六百噸的炸彈、如果法國對德開戰、德國用她的四百架輕爆炸機、能在任何地方擲下二十噸的炸彈、一旦開戰、則於八天或十天以內、可以破壞對方一五十到二百所重要城市、</p>
<p>法國得到了這樣的報吿、便已明白對付德國、單單法國一國還嫌不足、必須聯合其他國家、英國也受到同樣的刺激、因爲例如在蘇俄曾經試騐過的、空中撒布　菌、非常厲害、而在倫敦去年也曾用無毒的黴菌試騐過、由試騐的結果、知道到了戰時、用三十架飛機撒投毒菌、則六百萬倫敦市民、七小時之內就會遭遇全部殲滅的悲運、所以鮑爾溫樞密院長主張英國的防空該由「多法」推展至萊茵河畔、要防止空襲的慘禍、擴大空軍是當前最切要的事、并且要和歐洲大陸的空軍國相協商、</p>
<p>這就是英法防空協定的基因、假如德國恢復了從前的軍備、英國首先要咸受的恐怖就是被空軍襲擊、英國如果與法國締結了防空協約、則德國襲擊英國就得受法空軍的牽制、、英國的城市安全卽多一重保障、英法恊定和洛加羅保安條約不同之點、在從前祗英國帮助法國的安全、法國並無援助英國安全的義務、換言之、卽假若法國受到德國的武力侵略、英國要給德國以援助、對於英國如被侵略、則并沒有什麽規定、可是照這一次的防空恊定看來、英國如受空襲、締約國就得出而援助、這是於英國有利的、</p>
<p>在法國方面看、洛加羅保安條約是陳舊了、雖然英法之間在大體上并沒有十分的隔閡、然而這種條約現在需要增訂了、這次英法防空協定成立以後、對整個歐洲局勢、英法兩國間有一種新諒解、卽洛加羅條約的再行確定、法國如果受到德意志空軍的襲擊、英國飛行隊可以不必等待國際聯盟理事會决議的認可、競能够立刻出動、這樣看來、法國所得的「安全保障」比英國恐怕還大些、</p>
<p>表面上英法防空協定并不在乎防備德意志、并且還要邀請德國加入、同時還邀意大利比利時同來參加、好像東歐保安條約要請德國波蘭加入是一樣的、這是英國外交的長處、而其內心則以對德爲目標、德國而加入該協約、若使被侵略時、她們也得加以援助、這是新式保障和平的機構與舊式攻守同盟不同之點、德國處在這樣的環境中、不但要應付英法、而且還要注意到意大利、比利時、蘇聯等等的態度如何、德國如加入她們、難免永受凡爾賽和約及其他條約的束縛、若使不加入、則又有孤立的危險、所以照德國的立塲綸、這英法防空協定的成立在歐洲方面的安全、依然只是片面的而已、</p>
<h3>西北視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>新疆交通情況</p>
<p>新疆爲一純大陸性之省份、境有荒漠廣原、崇山峻嶺、惟甚少巨流深川、可供航行之便、故言該省交通事業、不及水運、而應亟謀陸空之發展、該省交通現況、略如下述</p>
<p>一航空　綫之計劃、是年冬、歐亞航空公司李景樅氏試飛平迪段處女航成功、籌備經營、至二十一年十二月十五日、開始作上海塔城兩處之第一次對飛、每週對開一次、在新計有塔城迪化哈密三站、其航綫、由塔至迪爲五二玉哩、由迪至哈五〇〇哩、計共需時約六點三刻、由塔城至上海、全綫計長四〇五〇哩、約合華里一萬二千里、按站飛行、四日可達、不僅爲新疆與內地航運最便之工具、抑且爲歐亞交通唯一之捷徑、惜全綫通航至次年卽受戰事影響而中斷、二十三年夏、新省戰事結束、該綫航運、至今仍僅通蘭州之東段、近聞塔城至哈密段、新省擬自行辦理、哈密迤東至蘭州、仍由歐亞航空公司展綫至哈、啣接聯運、此事醞釀已久、如能實現、國家主要動脈、庶可暢通無阻也、</p>
<p>二郵電　新省有綫電局、創自前淸光緒十九年、南路喀什、西路伊黎、北路塔城、阿泰爾、東路哈密、莫不綫網聯貫、通達省內省外、并可於發電之餘、約通短程電話、但沙漠荒涼、地方遼闊、電稈年久失修、易被風雨摧折、甘綏駝伕、隨綫長征、仰見完整磁碗、卽好以石遙擊、謂前途之泰否、可於中否卜之、無知土人亦多切綫作彈、伐桿爲薪、往往此修彼斷、遂致電報速率時較郵遞爲遲、普通由迪化拍往京平之報、量快三四日、遲則竟至三四星期、俗稱「駱駝電報」、殆非過甚其詞、電費因省票跌價、從未實收一字一角、目前雖規定每字收省票十六兩、但折合現洋亦只三分左右、若非地方政府代爲維持開支、各地電局不堪虧累、只有關閉而已、無綫電報、在北京政府時代、卽由前交通部於民國九十兩年、在迪化喀什兩處各設電台一所、原擬喀什與迪化通、迪化又與庫倫張家口北平轉通、不料外蒙獨立、庫倫電台生變、平迪遂無法直達、嗣裝修新機、於十四年通遼寗電台、十五年通濟南台、旋止於濟台、被燬於五三慘案時、十九年新省府添設短波電臺一座於迪化、能與太原通報、廿一年、奇台、哈密·鎮西·焉耆、亦各設一台、尙擬推設於伊黎·塔城·庫車·和關·阿爾泰各處、但因受戰事情影響、機件捐壞不少、喀什大電台、且被馬仲英部拆去一部份、携往和闐、尤爲可惜、現迪化台與內地通電成續甚佳、再加人事改善、前途至爲可觀、新省郵政、成績殊遜、主要原因、仍係受省票低落之影響、故新省郵票、印有「限新疆省貼用」字樣、不能寄至內地應用、郵局職工薪資、不及關內同業十分之一、譬如猩猩峽迤東郵差、月薪有多至四五十元者、峽西郵差、月得省票三百數十兩、僅合洋七八角、以購騎驢鐵蹄、卽去其半、生活困難、達於極點、職員情況、亦與此相同、枵腹從公、何能責以效率、加以省當局爲防止重要內情之外洩、縱非戰時、亦常派人檢查郵信、影響營業、當亦不淺、二十三年秋戰事結束、各縣郵局會奉停化檢查之令、前途曙光、或在是乎、三公路新疆驛道、大多平坦寬敞、略加修築、卽成公路、可以行駛汽車、若係戈壁硬砂、更可天然坦行、在新省擴展公路、重要工程僅在橋樑、可謂便利莫比、現已通車者、（一）迪塔綫、由迪化至塔城、二日可達、每人票價約合大洋三十餘元、（二）迪喀綫、於二十三年戰後、省府用軍用汽車逐漸南展、迪化區食糧恐慌、阿克蘇米因得救急、由喀什塔城跨出俄境、搭乘土西·及西伯利亞火車、卽可東回中國　　、（三）新綏綫、由迪化經蒙古至綏遠、係新綏長途汽車公司經辦、公司設天津、總站在綏遠、分站則在沿綫重鎮、以至哈密迪化等處、於二十二年十月通車、亦因戰事影響、停頓年餘、現已恢復、惟迪化至哈密段、歸省府自辦、以與該公司車在哈密互爲聯運、肅州亦已新設分站、兼便隴省商運、由綏至哈、約須十一二日、客票每人約二百七八十元、往年綏新駝運、俗稱半年走一趟、自汽車通駛以來、月內卽可往返、便利何啻霄壞、</p>
<p>新疆物產豐富、除數種主要貴物外、其餘均爲量巨值賤、不合汽車運載之原料品、由內地運新者、國產茶姻綢緞等物、亦不若洋貨之質輕價昂、且在汽車本身、所需車輛機件、巨量汽油、均惟外貨是賴、有損民族經濟、恐亦得不償失、故誠欲開發新疆交通、直接以達成本低廉、銷路廣暢之運輸目的、間接解决移民墾荒、發展實業之重大問題、則莫善於展長隴海鐵路、就地取材於祁連·天山之木料與煤礦、而完成伊（黎）蘭（州）綫之計劃也、（附言、目前欲赴新疆、無論考察旅行、以先向該省駐天津或駐南京之代表接洽手續、若欲乘新綏汽車時、最好函詢綏遠該總車站主任牟君爲便）、</p>

<h3>南翔石刻記</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>南翔爲吾邑（嘉定）之首鎮，有「雲翔寺，」（今咸稱爲大寺，）建於梁天監間，初士人掘地，得石徑丈，常有二鶴飛集其上，僧德齊卽其地建刹。唐開成間，僧行齊止錫，復有二鶴依之，莫少卿捐資增拓，乾符中，建尊勝陀羅雙石幢，（今屹然猶存，）嗣鶴去不返，久之，忽於石上得詩云：「白鶴南翔去不歸，唯留眞蹟在苔綦，可憐後代空王子，不絕熏修享二時，」至宋紹定間，賜「白鶴南翔」額，丞相鄭淸之書，迨元至元二十八年，僧良珦重建，明正統間，巡撫周忱，萬歷初，歙人任良佑修，祟禎十年僧海徵，淸順治僧慧默重修，巡撫周蠲免基糧，康熙三十九年，敕賜墨寳，改名「雲翔寺，」此今稱「大寺」之所由來也。</p>
<p>寺中有八景，日「經幢石，」曰「梁朝井，」曰「九品觀，」曰「雲臥樓，」日「楨明檜］」曰「博望槎，」曰「齊師鶴，」曰「鶴跡石，」幾閱滄桑，荒圯殆盡，唯「九品觀」之蓮池中央，向有「石塔」一座，高可二丈餘，傍刻佛像極精，且宛在水中，無有人敢渡登者，顧此「石塔，」不知建於何時，攷南翔鎭志，亦復失載，近悉姚孟篔（明煇）居士，有鑑於此，恐石塔之傾頹，與古蹟之湮沒，因無寺僧蓮雲，僱工修葺，乃於日前發現「石刻」文字甚多，中有「大宋嘉定十五年建造」一行，又有「萬歷戊戌重修」一記，居士如獲壞寳，喜出望外，今已將此「石刻」與諸佛像，，及宋以來之名人記文，拓成一帙，幷玫得此「石塔，」厥名「普同，」爲「甘子荆」所建造云。</p>
<p>計自「嘉定十五年，」訖今已七百十二年矣，「萬曆戊戌，」訖今亦三百七十六年，而吾邑置縣，在宋嘉定十年，則此「石塔」之建，不過落後五年耳，所異者，縣志鎭志俱無考，卽錢竹汀（大昕）以金石著聞於世，而於邑中，亦不免疏漏焉，故余喜居士之創獲，而特書之如右</p>
<h3>醬園</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>開門七件事裏，倒有四件事—油，，鹽，醬，醋—都要請教那醬園的。就是「米」，有些醬園裏亦都帶賣；所以醬園遂成爲人們不能不光顧的塲所。</p>
<p>醬園而稱「園」，是極言其塲面闊大的意思。據說要稱到「園」，很不容易。眞正的醬園，四鄉各處必設有分號。分號愈多，其園愈大，故一爿醬園，資本在二三百萬元者、也沒有什麽希奇。這種大醬園，卽使老闆無意越營，「其住財」也可値到四五萬元之巨。</p>
<p>還有一件奇怪事。各行生意儘管不景氣，紛紛大廉價，惟有醬園，則仍視若無覩；縱有，亦不過是幾家小醬園，想吸收現欵而已。至於大醬園，有時甚至連存戶想存現欵，「阿大」還裏搖着頭說，我們用不着什麼錢呢！「千做萬做，蝕本勿做」。這是行行如此。可是大醬園則不然。分號舉行「抄盤」時，能蝕本者，則總號必能賺錢。其原因是很淺顯的。四鄉分號愈蝕本，則某某牌號必愈能深深地印在人們的腦海裏，而總號裏的生涯，遂如百丈竿頭，日進千里了。</p>
<p>醬園裏的「阿大」甚多。除「總阿大」外，有「賬桌阿大」，「採辦阿大」等。據說「總阿大」的薪水，每年不過約二百千，然而他能周轉自如，卽開小醬園的也有。</p>
<p>開醬園是要有大資本的。譽如能做一萬生意，就要有三萬資本才行。</p>
<h3>意阿之争</h3>
<p>你為什麽要侵畧我</p>
<h3>朝天宮裏拜烏龜</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>烏龜兩個字，在中國本來是一個駡人的名詞，所以如果有人被駡爲烏龜的時候，必定要勃然大怒，因爲所謂烏龜者，是指老婆偸漢的代名詞，龜鴇相連，何怪人們要勃然大怒呢？</p>
<p>但是中國人的事情，是往往不可思議，本人旣不願作烏龜，却願和烏龜結乾親，使他的子女作一下小龜，事實是這樣的：首都建鄴路上有個朝天宮，宮裏有兩個石製的大烏龜，據說是一牡一牝，生成的一對龜夫婦。大概因爲它們已有好幾百年的歷史了，所以人們對它很垂靑眼，自願將兒子給它作乾兒子：女兒給它作乾女兒；不過拜乾親的手續是很簡單，只須用一份香燭，和一條紅頭纔，在烏龜跟前磕三個頭，然後把紅頭繩綑在烏龜身上，片刻解下來，再圍在小孩的頸項裏，這拜乾親的典禮，就算吿終了！</p>
<p>在廢曆新正的時候，朝天宮裏，擠滿了烏龜的乾親家，和烏龜的乾兒子；乾女兒：烏龜如果有靈，也就足以自豪了！至於他們爲什麽不結狗乾親；猪乾親：卻却偏要和被萬人唾棄的烏龜結乾親，這當然是有他們的命意，因爲中國有句俗語，呌做「龜壽千年」，所以他們心中認定烏龜是長壽的。現在，他們子女作了小龜，當然也可以長壽了！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　唐突女郞前露財選色顗覦壚隙裏爲病傷廉</p>
<p>賈多才遠速的立着，斜僱了身子，向月英望去，將一隻脚在地上顚動着道：這話或者是眞的。可是在今天晚上，他怎麽又這樣會說呢？月英依然向着桌子角裏坐下，低聲道：那也是沒有法子呀，不說怎麽辦呢？他說話的時候搭訕着，一手扶了椅子扶手，一手伸着兩個指頭，在桌子檔上，不住的亂畫。賈多才審査着他這番嬌羞的態度，依然，還是可以親愛的樣子，於是向胡氏道：你娘兒兩個，若是覺得在今天日子太快了一點子，就是明天或者後天，那也沒有什麽要緊。明天在家裏和他洗洗操，洗洗頭，那也像個新娘子樣子，能趕緊和他做兩件衣服換換，那就更好。要你娘兒兩個是眞的願意了，我也可以先給你們一點錢，去料理家事。朱胡氏道：喲！那可是眞好了，我們還有啥話說呢？孩子，你看這樣好嗎？你舅母就指望我們帶了錢回去呢？我們空着手好進門嗎？一提到了舅母，月英也就覺得頭疼，每天自在坑上睜眼以後，他就是說不得了，一直要到上坑閉了眼睛，他纔不說。今天母女出來了，這樣久回去，一點什麽消息沒有，那他是不依的。現在賈多才肯給點錢，讓拿回去，不管怎麽樣，先討得舅母一陣歡喜。（一五三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>記得我們離開北京上奉天去的時候，最後一次來到頤和園中，兀是還不曾見有怎樣爛漫的春意；因爲那時候殘冬初盡，花木多半尙未透發，所見的無非是才長的綠葉，和一些含苞的蓓蕾而已。現在只隔了十四天功夫，可是那多能的大自然，已幹出了一番驚人的奇蹟來了！整個的頤和園，到處都給它點綴得花花綠綠，猶如錦繡世界一般；各種顏色鮮麗的花朶兒，像在爭奇鬥勝似的怒放着。</p>
<p>牡丹花，這是太后平生所最偏愛的一種花草，所以這園內是種得非常之多的，可說是到處全有；春風吹過，那些斗大的花兒，都隨着一俯一仰的搖晃起來，倒像在向太后顚頭，表示歡迎的意思。當初沒有隨駕上奉天去的一般太監，大半都給李蓮英派在園子裏照管一切，他們瞧見老佛爺又給我們簇擁着回來了，心上都很高興，紛紛上來叩頭，臉上濟帶着幾分歡喜的神氣。在那萬壽山的下面，給四周的許多宮院團團地包圍着的便是見明湖。湖水明凈得像鏡子一樣’靜悄悄地的在日光下躺着，發出銀子一般的光來；湖中不時還有許多的小魚，很活潑地跳出水面來，偶然也有跳離水面二三寸髙的，但總是立卽就落下去了，因爲它們這樣不定的在活動，水面上便不定的可以看見一圈一圈的波紋，由小而大，像螺旋似的擴展着。</p>
<p>太后處到了這種境界裏，眼前頓覺光明了許多。（二六四）</p>

<h3>趣話一束</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>廣吿術…一天，有位朋友對在下說：今天遇着一椿事，眞正豈有此理。在下問他，是什麽事？他說：我走過××公司的門首，圾窗嘉陳列的商品，眞是琳琅滿目。有兩樣很引人注目的東西，就是「避疫口罩」和「衛生月經帶，」却並掛在一起。橫豎不分，上下無別，這不是荒天下之大唐嗎？在下道：這正是幽默的作風，也就是『廣吿術』之一種咧。</p>
<p>溫吞水與夾生飯…在下的鄰右，有幾家都是蘇州人。於是有兩個男子，都被幾個蘇州女人叫出渾號來。一個呌做溫呑水，一個呌做夾生飯。後來叫慣了，他們也會欣然答應。溫呑水，因爲他的脾氣，有些陰陽乖氣。就是駡他笑他，他也並不動火。夾生飯，脾氣較爲難弄。就是半生半熟，令人難吃消的意思。他們兩個人碰在一起，煞是好看。一個兒是半生半熟，一個兒是弗冷弗熱。</p>
<p>小鬼揑鼻頭…畫家袁天祥君，好飮酒，又好吃大蒜，爲人很有風趣。一夕，和友人酒叙，君持蒜大嚼。友以其味不可嚮邇，竟揑着鼻子。過了幾天，這友請教他畫扇。後來扇畫好了，友拿來一看。畫的却是鍾進士一手持着大蒜頭，在大嚼。一小鬼在旁，揑着鼻子。</p>
<p>樂在其中…女傭們最喜講東家的好歹：有一次，聽見鄰家的女傭這樣的說：我們奶奶年紀雖靑，眞是厲害。少爺出去，終要限時限刻他回來。倘然過了時刻，就要罰他跪在面前。我們做用人的，勸也不好勸。你們想，是兇不兇。在下曾以這件事，講給一個朋友聽。他說：怕老婆，自有怕老婆的一種樂趣。旁人聽了，以爲苦不勝言。他做矮人的，拜倒石榴裙下，却正是「樂在其中」咧。</p>
<p>腦膜炎…有友×君，自己也是做醫家的。一晚，在北市飮酒過醉，就僱了人力車回去。却不說明地址，到了半途，忽沉況睡去。那車夫因呼喊不應，就拉到崗警旁邊。那崗警問了車夫幾句，見他面色並不紅。疑他害了急病，便命車夫拉到一家醫院裹去。醫生說是「腦膜炎，」爲他打針。到了半夜，他開了轉來。見身在醫院，大爲詫異。那看護婦對他說明：你患的是「腦膜炎，」很危險的。他跥脚道：我何嘗患腦膜炎？我是一時酒醉所致。結果，付了六元的醫藥費，才跑了出來。後來朋友見他飮酒的當兒：總要這樣的警吿他，你要當心腦膜炎發作啊。</p>

<h3>敎部督導　各地學校硏究問題辦法（三）</h3>
<p>為請修正中學算學課程標準建議書</p>
<p>二十三年度中學會考成績經教育部統計結果、以算學一科爲最劣、二十三年夏、北平市各髙中會考成績之統計、亦以算學爲最劣、國立各大學歷年入學考試據一般經騐、算學一科成績亦劣、查算學爲中學主要課程之一、現象如此、問題之嚴重可知、設不速　補救辦法、不僅徒然浪費中學多數靑年之光陰與精力、且亦有背國家教育人才與提髙算學一科程度之本旨、</p>
<p>按現行中學算學課程標準、爲教育部二十一年十一月所頒訂、其學程之規定如下列兩表、</p>
<p>初中算學學程時間支配表</p>
<p>學時學　第一學年　第二學年　第三學年</p>
<p>程數期　第一學期　第二學期　第一學期　第二學期　第一學期　第二學期</p>
<p>算術（附簡易代數）　四　四</p>
<p>代數　三　三　二　二</p>
<p>幾何（附數值三角）　二（實騐幾何）　二　三　三</p>
<p>高中算學學程時間支配表</p>
<p>學時學　第一學年　第二學年　第三學年</p>
<p>程數期　第一學期　第二學期　第一學期　第二學期　第一學期　第二學期</p>
<p>代數　三　三　二</p>
<p>幾何　三　二</p>
<p>三角　一　二</p>
<p>解析幾何大意　二　二</p>
<p>就以上課程標準實施情形觀察、有應特別注意者數點、</p>
<p>一·據第一表、所有初中學生皆必修算術·代數·幾何·三角等科、如果注重教學方法、愼選教材内容、即此初中算學課程似已應足以使學生了解形象與數量之基本觀念、樹立普通算學敎育之基礎、而啟發其向上探討之志趣、</p>
<p>二·據第二表、現時髙中旣不分科、則所有髙中學生不問個別志趣、或將來職業上與升學上之需要、皆須一律肄習同樣之髙級代數、立體幾何、三角及解析幾何大意等學程、</p>
<p>三·髙中算學各課程旣爲普通必修科、在教學時、教帥如牽就少數程度較優之學生、勢必使大多數學生淪爲伴讀者而少所獲益、如教學以大多數中級生爲準、勢必又至使算學教學成績之水平綫降低、似此則現行之劃課程標準、不不足提髙中學算學程度、結果或得其反、</p>
<p>四·現今各大學理科每感學生在中學所培養之算學基礎不足、或程度太差、適應此項需要、首在重視髙中學生對於算學個別興趣、充實髙中算學課程教村及改善算學教學方法、但現行之高中算學梨程旣為一般學生所普修、敎學方面、勢難顧及個別志趣、大多數學生隨班聽講、目標僅在考試及格、算學課程內容自難充實與提髙、更何從培養升入大學之算學良好的基礎、</p>
<p>五·髙中學生對於算學學習能力本有差別、其就業與　學之需要亦自不同、今强其學同一之髙級算學課程、不僅所學程度難齊、不切實用、徒然浪費精力、低减一般學習效能、甚且學生中有因性近文藝、對於算學本感困難、竟或遭意外之淘汰、不克發展共　長俾得繼續深造而成爲社會有用之人才、</p>
<p>六·普通高級中學課程　屬爲多數升學學生而設、但按之實際、我國髙中畢業生並不能普遍升入大學深造、即能多數升入大學亦不能普遍專攻理科、現行髙中算　課程對於不升學之靑年　　＃似　實用之處、對於升學者入理科旣感程度之不足、入他科又感無實際之需要、棖據上項觀察、爲愛護中學靑年光陰與增進學習效能計、爲充實中學算學課程內容計、爲適應大學理科需要計、對於現行中學算學課程標準之實施皆應速　補救之方、同人等管見所及約有數端、謹獻蒭蕘、敬備參考、</p>
<p>一·高中算學課程分組敎學　依學生個別志趣與學業需要、以志願升入大學理科及性喜算學者、爲（甲）組、以志願升入大學文科或無力升學者爲（乙）組、用組所習算學學程應就現行髙中算學課程標準充實教材內容、嚴格推進、以期提髙中學算學程度而應大學理科需要、乙組所習算學學程應酌變教材内容與减輕分量、力求切於實用而合乎學者志趣與需要、（按法國普通中學算學即係分組教學）高中算寧旣依志趣與需要分組教學、其效能自必增進、算學程度無形中可以切實與相當提髙、</p>
<p>二·規定現行髙中算學課程最低標準、標準外之算學課程除志願入大學理工科者必修外、其他名生可視蠶選修、（按民口十二年新學開課程楓準　要、高中普通科第一組必修算學僅六學分、第二組必修算　則爲十八學分、）各高級中學可添設髙級實用算學之學程、「供給各學科研究上必需之算理知識、以充實學生考　自然與社會現象之能力」、並藉以補充初中所培養之普通算學教育基礎而啟發學生向上研究之志趣、依上規定志願入大學理工科之髙中學生對於算學旣可深造、性喜高中算學者亦可議量選修、教學成績自必增進、其他學生亦可節省時聞培養其他專科之良好基礎以應升學或深造之需要、梅貽琦·張伯苓·李書華·周學章·胡濬濟·文元模·徐金據·胡國鈺·劉廷芳·常道直·黄敬思·張懷·李建助·高厚德·傳種孫·陳衡哲·查良釗·張彭春·楊石先、（完）</p>

<h3>皮膚的衛生和皮膚病的預防（二）</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>吾人知道要預防皮膚病。不僅僅注意到皮膚局部的衛生。同時還要注意到全身內部的關係。其中對於消化器的關係。更加重要。倘消化器不健全。發生障碍的時候。就可以發生皮膚病。例如消化器管的粘膜。就是胃腸發生炎證的時候。因腸管要面停滯的食物腐敗。發生着毒物。吸收到血液裏面。就會發生蕁蔴疹和中毒性紅斑。醫學上就呌做「自家性中毒」。這是常常遇到的。次之爲食物的關係。有幾種食物。例如香蕈麻姑，貝殼類以及鹹貨等等。吃了以後。可以直接發生皮膚病。還有一種呌做特異質。就是病人和普通的人有特異的性質。例如吃了某種食物以後。卽刻發生皮膚病。但是在他人並不如此。這就呌做特異質。以上均和消化器有直接的關係。此外大便的是否通順。也和胃腸的調和與否。有重大的影響。就是上面所講的食物停滯有常習性便秘的人。並常常發生皮膚病。所以有便秘的人。應當選擇適當的食物。令大便每日通順。吃些豆類，蘿葡等。有時用些適當的和平瀉藥。使蓄積的大便排除。停滯於腸管內的有害物。可以除去。胃腸的機能整調。消化順遂。就可以免避皮膚病的發生。</p>
<p>哺乳期的小兒和食物的關係。更須注意。有一種呌做「過剩的營養」。就是小兒用人乳或牛乳哺乳的時候。因攝取含有多量脂肪的乳。往往有陷於過度的營養。結果就發生皮膚疹。尤以有滲出性質體質的小兒。他所發生的皮膚疹。更加旺盛。擴張到頭部和顏面。等到過了哺乳期。還繼續發生。有這樣皮疹的小兒。倘使呌他吃些米湯或粥的時候。有時竟然自己消退。所以食物和皮膚病關係的重要。就可以明白。甚們現在所講的是過剩營養。可以發生皮膚病。但是營養低下。也可以和皮　病有關。例如腺病性疾病。常因營養不足的緣故。</p>
<p>現在　　　　　　。大約述之如下。</p>
<p>脂肪性的　　。對皮　　應當注意。但是吾國普通的人民。所攝取的脂肪量少。並不像歐洲人那樣的多。但是有幾種有瘙癢的皮膚病。例如濕疹，　　疹，以及痤瘡等。都和脂防有關係。所以對於脂肪性食物。應當節制纔行。因爲脂肪性食物不容易消化。停滯在胃腸裏面。引起胃勝障碍。發生便閉。所以對於皮膚病有不良的影響。次之爲鹹貨物。也和脂肪一樣。對皮膚病有關係。吾國的人民。吃盥比較的多。但是我們研究皮膚病的發生和洽療。知道限制鹽分的攝取。實屬緊要。倘能節制鹽分。對皮膚病常有良好的結果。現在所盛行的無鹽乃至乏食鹽食餌療法。就是這個意思。把日常的食物。完全除去鹽分。或僅有少量的鹽分。攝取其他的代用品。去治療疾病。有用這樣的療法。可以把極頑固的惡性皮膚結核治愈。就是對於其他的疾病。也有相當的好結果。</p>
<p>根據飼養動物的試騐。知道與以酸性食餌的時候。對於皮膚炎症刺戟的感應度强。與以「阿爾加里性食餌的時侯。他的感應度就减弱。所謂皮膚戚應度强。就是表示皮膚容易發生皮膚病。證之吾人日常的食物。也是一樣。所以食酸過多的食物。譬如肉，鷄卵，乾酪等物。對於皮膚病。應當禁止。反之牛乳，各種的菜類，馬鈴薯，果實等。對皮膚炎性刺戟的感應性遲。可以攝取。沒有妨碍。總之多數的炎性皮膚病。與以大量的食鹽時。可以誘發病症。或使之惡化。已爲今日各國學者所承認。</p>
<p>次之酒精類。不但直接對胃腸有損害。因爲他能够擴張血管。引起充血。對於皮膚病有大害。尤以有瘙癢性的皮膚病。更加應當嚴禁。此外以酒精爲直接原因的酒渣鼻，皮脂過多症等。避去酒精。實爲根本的要著。茶，濃咖啡等興奮過敏的神經。對於瘙癢的皮膚病。也應當禁止。（未完）</p>

<p>「開發西北！」「開發西北！」這口號不論是在朝的官員，和在野的一般人民之間，近年來是流行得頗似一句口頭禪了：而事實上西北的交通和其他事業的建設的確也有急速的進步。醫藥衛生方面，政府也在積極的努力着，只是一時難於普遍，效力還很微少。</p>
<p>平凉是隴東十數縣中的首縣，在甘肅也是數一數二的縣份，要算人口稠密和商業繁盛的地方；然而科學醫在此地，却是被一股烏烟瘴氣所籠罩着。</p>
<p>說起此地的醫院數目來，並不算少，除了天主敎和基督敎在此各設一所醫院外，診病兼售藥品的大小醫院有七所，專售藥品衛生器材的藥房有二所；而且各醫院的門面都裝璜得很美觀，全是玻璃窗橱和金字招牌，另還寫着許多注射「六〇六」「九一四」「果能克淋」等字樣</p>
<p>可是諸位如停住脚細看一下，就可發現令人笑破肚皮的別扭，相信我說烏烟瘴氣並不是寃屈的了。有個醫院的門口掛着醫師的名字，名字上面居然加上「現代醫學士」五個字的頭銜，我們可以想像得到，有這樣好頭銜的醫師，醫術一定是異常高明的，只是不知道這頭銜是誰個加封給他的呢？</p>
<p>作者爲求知欲所驅使，曾經過幾番詳細的調査，纔知道除了二所敎會醫院的醫師以外，沒有一所醫院的醫師是正式醫校出身的！就中有二個是西安××醫院護士學校出來的，有的是從前國民軍中所遺留下來的軍醫，還有的是其他地方遷移來的。</p>
<p>他們對於醫藥學的理論是沒有的，只多少有點經騐，一般人民「中醫長內科，西醫長外科」的觀念，是被他們所造成的；因爲他們的醫術只憑一點經騐，診治平常的皮膚病和小外科都是十分勉强的了，那裏還能够把艱深的內科病診斷得準確呢？</p>
<p>說到他們的業務是很淸淡的，這一面是得不到百姓的信仰，一面是藥品售價太貴；一般貧窮的百姓沒有資格來問津。二個敎會醫院却是例外，每日門診平均約有二十人（內科祇佔四分之一弱，據說雖有住院的病人，也有病房的設置，因爲伙食問題不好收拾，暫不收留），這因爲他們是慈善性質，一面又是藉外國人的力量，由上海運來的衛生器材入陝西地界的流關，入甘肅地界的涇川，可免抽收繁重的落地稅：因此取費比普通醫院來得低廉。再一面也是他們的設備比較完備，技術比較精良的緣故。（完）</p>
<p>附註：開發西北呼聲甚髙的現在，關心西北的人當然不在少數；—醫藥衛生事業是重要的工作，爲此作者不敢緘默，爰將實情簡單的報吿如上，以供關心者用作參考的資料。</p>
<p>二四，二，二七，於甘肅平凉。</p>

<p>心窩膨滿，食思缺乏，便秘，脛骨前面的浮腫，腓　肌疼痛。在初期，腱反射亢進，但後來却逐漸减退。這樣的初期症狀，　　僅數星期，其中有由治療而全愈的。</p>
<p>（問）患脚氣病　，各　　什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）各部的病狀，最重要的是神經系，和那循環器的障礙，小便的異常，呼吸器症狀，新陳代謝障礙及發熟等。</p>
<p>（問）神經系中有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）因爲脚氣病，是一種多發性神經炎尤其於末梢部分最易被侵，所以先現於下肢，次及上肢。而神經症狀中的威覺障礙，像知覺鈍麻和異常感覺，其常發的部位，從下腿和足背到上腿，或從指失到前臂和肱，與及下腹部和口的周圍</p>
<p>（問）脚氣病人，是不是有運動障礙的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）有的。運動障礙中主要的是麻痺，大多是變側性，先起於下肢尤如伸肌，成爲內翻足的形狀（足尖位），其結果致步行困難。上肢麻痺（握力减退），呼吸肌麻痺（呼吸困難），喉肌麻痺（嗄聲），眼肌麻痺，（眼臉下垂）腹肌麻痺（少尿，排尿障礙，便秘）。又有痙孿運動（下肢更甚。也有運動失調像手指震顫等。</p>
<p>（問）患了脚氣病，神經反射有無變化？</p>
<p>（答）反射，在初期亢進，後來消失。膝蓋腱反射消失，最爲普通。瞳孔反射正常</p>
<p>（問）感覺器起什麼變化？</p>
<p>（答）視力减退，或有中心暗點。</p>
<p>（問）血管運動神經，有什麼症狀？</p>
<p>（答）末梢血管收縮，致皮膚蒼白，乾燥，汗液分泌减少。</p>
<p>（問）患了脚氣病之後，循環器病狀是怎麼樣的？</p>
<p>（答）循環器中的病狀，脈搏血壓和心臟血管都有變狀的。</p>
<p>（問）脈搏怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）脈搏大都頻數，每分鐘計有九十到一百次，並且很是軟弱，又快又不規則。所以非常不安定。</p>
<p>（問）血壓怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）最大血壓，達一百四十耗水銀柱。衝心性脚氣時，有降下到八十或七十耗的。最小血壓，必定下降到四十或三十或十耗。</p>
<p>（問）心臟有什麼變化？</p>
<p>（答）心臟視診，心尖搏動很强，觸診時，心尖搏動擴張，並且向方移動。打診時，心濁音界擴大，到右上方繼達左上方。聽診時，心尖有收縮期雜音。</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（五）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>（四）摩擦　摩擦在止痛上也有相當的價値。正當的摩擦很可止慢性的痛，並且發炎快遜去時用合宜的麼擦可以把組織（細胞）當中剩下的廢料驅散使排洩出去。注意此種手術必須在發炎完全停止後施行，否則與休息之大旨相背卽使發炎加甚。這種手術施於神經炎（或作腦綫炎）與肌肉炎最爲適宜。摩擦收效與否可由其結果决定。若是痛减輕，腫消去，不活動的漸活動卽好結果的現象，如若結果相反卽施行的不得當而有害</p>
<p>還有一種手術呌做『揉揑術』也有消腫止痛的作用。其理由卽揉揑肌肉可將其中所藏發炎剩下的廢料先擠散，由血流增多而排洩離身。此種作用如同捏放海綿而使海綿內所吸的水完全新。肌肉也是一樣經揉捏，老血與廢料同被擠出新血充滿，恢復健全停止疼痛一舉兩得。</p>
<p>（五）局部充血法　局部充血法對於止痛有很大的效力。根據這種原理現在有了很多的療法。有的是很簡單的方法有的好像是很奇妙的科學方法。</p>
<p>（一）用熱力　適當的熟用適當的方法加在痛的部分是可以止痛的。我們已經講過止痛第一須休息，第二就是用熱的方法。這也是最普通的止痛方法，並且也是到處可以實行的。熱的效用卽能鬆弛發炎部分的張力；因爲痛是與張力成正比例—張力越大痛的也越厲害，故减少了張力也就是减少了痛。</p>
<p>用熱有很多的方法。方法不同有各但原理却是一樣，結果也大同小異。實施熱的方法有以下幾種：（一）包絨布或棉花。無論什麽時表皮上疼痛用絨布或棉花包起或蓋起就可免去痛處少受外面激刺，因此疼痛减少身體舒服。（二）熱濕布敷，减去張力增加血流，止痛效力很大。（三）藥泥劑糊在痛處。（四）電被蓋於筋骨痛瘋濕痛有益不小，不過不是平民所可享受的。（五）熱水袋，這是普通家用止痛器，用得其宜也有相當的價値。一樣缺點就是熱水袋的重量壓在痛處。（六）透熱機療（俗稱電療）。此種熱力在肌肉深處較他種手術略好，不過也沒有很多神妙的作用。（七）照光電燈與愛士光用得當也有些止痛的功用。無論何種熱術施行後隨卽用一些冷水摩擦可使血聚在痛處時間較長些，止痛的效力也因而加長。</p>
<p>（二）反感刺激法（Counterirritaion）這一種方法就是在身體別部分用藥使起一種發炎作用結果可以帮助疼痛减輕。反感刺激作用有兩種辦法，一擦藥在痛處外加摩擦，二發炎的部分擦藥而不加摩擦。有時使皮膚一部分起泡以止慢性痛就是這個道理。</p>
<p>（三）冷力　有些深部分的痛用冷，如水袋也是有益的。心痛，盲腸痛，頭內痛，喉痛冷可以减低發炎的張力故亦可以减少痛苦。</p>
<p>（四）心理治療　有的人神經很容易受激刺，很怕痛，越怕痛痛也越覺到厲害。有時有的人有的痛完全是心理作用，其實他沒有痛。這樣的人須要有人開導安慰他的心同時施行以上所講無害的止痛方法亦無不可。假設不如此時時給他麻醉品麻木他的神經，那樣正是與他有害而無益，並且也永久不能止住他的痛。若能使他有樂觀的態度忘記他的小痛苦是與他有實在的益處。</p>
<p>止痛藥類</p>
<p>止痛藥大概屬於以下三類，一鎭靜神經藥，二止痛藥，三麻醉藥。各有各的正當用途，用得適宜好處不少，用得不適宜傷身損財於痛無補。茲且從略容後於實用處詳述。</p>
<p>以上已講過的生理解剖學與治療的原理。所講僅限於原則，至於身體各部分的疼痛症很多，病原各不相同治療法也各異，故須先明瞭各種痛症的病理才能運用原理得當。各種痛各有特別止痛方法所以必須分別來研究。有好幾種很平常的痛病現在來特別討論討論諒必爲讀者所贊成。</p>
<p>胃痛</p>
<p>胃痛是一種很普通的毛病並且也是一種纏綿的痛。假設每一百人中有一人有胃痛，全國當中就有四百萬有胃痛的人。再假設平均每四百人中有一人有胃痛全國也就有一百萬人有胃痛病。有幾種的胃病使胃痛，病各不相同止痛方法亦各異。茲分述於下以供讀者研究：</p>
<p>胃炎　平常所講胃炎卽胃內部發紅發腫，患者卽覺到胃痛。這種胃痛是肚子餓時痛吃過飯也痛。胃炎最普通的原因爲不易消化食物，或吃飯太快，或烟酒過度，或飮食太冷太熱，或口鼻喉病爛牙齒等，或吞服激刺藥品毒品。</p>
<p>必須先明白這些原因治療才能有把握。大概止痛方法如下：（一）如身體能休息的休息，其次須休息胃。休息胃的方法卽短時間不進食物。（二）熱濕布敷腹上部一日數次。（三）漸進飮食時起始少進蛋靑水（一個鷄蛋靑和一杯溫開水）或稀牛奶或稀藕粉湯米湯麵湯。後來漸進稀飯與別種軟食物。病全愈可漸漸回復平日飮食。宜戒不易消化食物與不良習慣。（四）當戒除烟酒。（五）治好口鼻喉各種毛病也是免除胃炎的必須辦法。</p>
<p>胃瘡　胃瘡是一種很平常的毛病。在我國尙無普徧統計，歐美却早有準確的統計。如北美洲人民每百分之一·三有胃瘡，英國人民百分之五有胃瘡，丹麥人民百分之十六·七有胃瘡。由此可見胃瘡是很普徧的卽胃痛也是很普徧的痛苦。</p>
<p>胃瘡長在胃的內膜。生胃瘡的原因常由於口部鼻喉的生膿症。激刺的食物，過辣過酸，烟酒過度等。胃瘡之痛是在胸骨之下腹之上部。有時背後中部也覺到痛。這種痛每日常是很按時有的，比如每吃過飯痛停止了，過了一兩小時又痛了，痛了一時又停了。每天如此逐年累月常是疼痛，不過有時輕些有時重些。病重的眞是病魔纏身時時痛苦人生那還有幸福可言。（未完）</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十八）近視眼</p>
<p>世上患近視眼的人。照現在看起來。可算得很多的了。因爲世界各國。均已趨入文明時代。埋頭用眼工作的時候多。所以釀成近視眼的機會亦特易。反轉來講。就是尙未十分開化的地方。譬如菲洲，蒙古，西藏等處。則患近視眼的人特少。這是因爲根本用眼工作的時候。不多的綠故（參閱後述的第（三）條。）我們從醫學史上探考近視眼發生的原因。則有遺傳說，充血說，調節說，輻筷說，視神經破壞說，眼窩構造或迥轉筋說，近業說，及鞏膜延性說等等學說。都係學術上的討論。我現在不便加以詳細的說明和批評。而單就她的一般成立的原因。略爲一說。</p>
<p>近視眼的成立。乃由前節所述的「眼能視物的理由」。而不能實施攝影機所具的機能而成。這種眼睛係屬於非正視眼中的一種。換言之。就是具有一種不健全視力的眼球。她的能力。祇可近視。不能遠視。因爲她的水晶體的凸度太大。或因她的眼軸太長。所以由光綫所生的物像。雖有虹彩收放的調度，水晶體的屈折，及她天然的調節作用。但是不能完全適合映在網膜的上面。祇可映在網膜的前方（參照附圖）。所以凡遠距離的物體。都不能明瞭看見。有了這種近視的眼球。當然須用矯正眼鏡來輔助才是。</p>
<p>近視眼對於年齡，地方，教育，職業，及遺傳等等。均有密切的關係。我現在把他分條略加說明。也可作爲近視眼原因的參考啊。</p>
<p>（一）對於年齡的關係！幼年時候患近視眼的很少。年屆春機發動期。則患數漸增。</p>
<p>（二）對於地方的關係—城市的兒童。比較鄉村的兒童。容易患着近視眼。</p>
<p>（三）對於教育的關係—學校的程度。與患近視眼的人數。常成正比例。就是程度漸髙。患數亦漸增。其中勸勉的學生。比較懶惰的學生。則又覺容易患着些。所以有教育的國家。常多近視眼。</p>
<p>（四）對於職業的關係—譬如文學家，著作家，書畫家，彫刻家，以及教員，抄錄員等等。多半常患近視眼。</p>
<p>（五）對於遺傳的關係—近視眼常有遺傳的素因。若一家之中。父爲近視眼。則其子每每亦爲近視眼。我的家庭中。就是這種情形。（父旣爲近視眼而四子中到有三子是近視眼）。依此推想讀者諸位的家庭中。或者也許有着這種事實啊。（未完）</p>

<h3>肺結核淺說（四四）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第九章　臨床上的經過</p>
<p>（二）急性粟粒結核　增生性的型式嚴重狀態，尋常較滲出性稍好一點；他的經過大半是慢性，熱度也不很高，物理的和血液圖像方面的檢查結果，都沒有滲出性型式那樣嚴重。但其中急性粟粒結核一型式，完全是屬諸例外，他的預後情形，大牟是惡劣的。他的起因，係結核菌侵襲到血液系統的關係，這在本書第四章裏面已經述過了！他的臨床上經過，根據患者症象種種不同，有傷寒性，腦膜炎性，和肺臟三種的分別。他的開始情形，都是突然發生的。關於第一種的症象，和傷寒症是很類似的。高熱神志昏迷，脈數較緩，脾臟腫大，尿中現蛋白，Diazo反應正號，白血球數目正常或减少，帶紅色白血球减少，有時發生薔薇疹，這都是傷寒症的顯著症象，在此處也可發生的。但他的呼吸情形，大半是很速的，這是在傷寒症方面比較鮮見的。關於肺部的物理檢査，所得的也不很多。至於這兩方面最有力的證據，自不能不推細菌的和X光的檢査了！關於第二種的症象，係和腦膜炎一症很類似的。溫度增高，頭痛，嘔吐，脈數緩慢，頸孿，項部强直，全身知覺過敏，腹筋陷沒緊張，瞪孔强直或斜視等情；這在尋常流行性腦膜炎一症，都是應有儘有的。這方面最重要的認識，就是脊椎液中結核菌的證明。尋常鐵勃固靈的反應，大半是陰性；但皮內反應則時現陽性，這是不可不注意的。關於第三種的症象，大半是偏重肺部一方面的。患者以劇烈乾咳爲先驅，呼吸增速及困難，小循環發生障碍，結果口唇面部均呈靑紫色：髙熱，脈膊頻數，血液和尿中變化，係和傷寒性差不多的。肺部的物理檢査，則打診時較微弱，聽診時現銳利呼吸音，氣管枝雜音，水泡音是很少發生的。有時因毛細氣管枝的連帶發炎，會發生急性肺膨脹，在這個時期，肺部淸音的範圍，當然是向下面闊大的。——上面所述的情形，是專指純粹增生性病灶而言：但如果是兼有滲出性的話，他的肺部症象是更加顯著的！像强烈的濁音，多數的氣管枝音，和捻髮性水泡音是；就是痰中結核菌的證明，也是非常習見的。</p>
<p>關於急性粟粒結核的診斷，有時是很不容易水落石出的。幾種著名的病症，像傷寒，敗血膿毒症，中心性肺炎，瘧疾等；都在鑑別之列的。這方面最重要的檢査，自不能不推X光透視和脊椎中結核菌證明兩者了！眼部方面的精密檢視，有時也不可輕易放過的。他的預後情形，大半是惡劣的：其中少數轉危爲安的例外，乃係由此而轉入慢性粟粒鬆的。他在最初發生的時候，症勢的嚴重情形，已比較緩和些；經過相當時期後，高熱下降，呼吸困難情形也不發生，就是尋常的一般狀態，也可由此一天比一天好；結果病者生命的藉以延長，有時爲期是很長的。</p>

<h3>鹽業統制與鹽政之將來</h3>
<p>— 歧童</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>鹽爲國民日常必需二物，其重要不在薪糧之下。是以東西各國，無不視監督食鹽之產銷，爲國家要政之一。蓋爲顧全人民之衛生者半，而爲防阻奸商操縱，摧殘民生者亦半。鹽務之視爲國家要政，在我國尤有悠長之歷史，以其爲國庫重要財源之一也。雖在今日，鹽稅之於國庫，其重要亦僅在關稅之下。惟我國行鹽之制，複雜紊亂，自古而然。積弊相承，從無澄淸之日。馴致摧殘民力，爲國家最惡之政，良足慨然。民國二十年中，立法院有新鹽法之通過，廓淸積弊，廢止一切錯綜被雜之行鹽區域與行鹽制度，誠有史以來所未有之善舉。切中時弊，迎合需要，所謂福國利民之傑作也。惜法立而不行，制廢而猶在，良足興嘆。三年以來，政府雖三度整理鹽稅，如地十一年七月之整理產區及各省邊區稅率，二十二年十月之普遍整理鹽區稅率，二十三年元旦公布之實施新衡制市平及規定正附鹽稅率，然因其爲捨本逐末之舉，且用心只在增加鹽稅收入，非在澈底改制，故殊無涉於鹽政之根本問題。鹽政之爲惡政，依然如昔也。近來報章，忽有統制鹽業之消息，其具體之統制方法如何，現尙無從得悉。惟衡之統制本義，則凡稔知鹽政內情者，類皆知其爲標髙立異，厥之事實，無由實行，亦無此必要也。爰就所知，組陳數義，願以就正於倡議統制之賢達。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>統制之對象有二：一是侵害本國市塲之外貨，一是供過於求之內國貨物。對於前者，在使舶來貨物，不爲本國巿塲之累，簡言之，即限制不必要或有害於本國市塲之貨物之輸入是也。關於後者，在謀貨物內國產銷之一致，使無生產過剩或不足之事發生。故所謂統制，其第一義原在對付外貨，其第二義始在齊一本國之產銷。我人執此以衡鹽業統制，則鹽非普通商品，外貨絕不能侵入中國市塲，則統制之第一義已無存在矣，是以謂無此必要也。要於齊一本國之產銷，則在今日專商包商存在之下，又非統制所能勝其任矣，以在專商包商制度之上，無從再套以統制制度也。且進而論之。</p>
<p>在自由買賣之下，貨物之生產，全以市塲為主，至於市塲之能否吸收其商品，則非彼之所問矣，是之謂無政府式之生產。生產旣以市塲爲目的，而又不問市塲之吸收能力，則生產者競爭逐利之結果，必成生產過剩，市塲呆滯之現象，經濟恐慌，緣是以生，各國政府，爲免致發生此種過度膨脹後之反動，故對於產銷，施行管理，助以統計之法，謀供給需要之一致。是似統制之另一意義，又在對無限制之自由競爭而發也。我國行鹽之制，有已開放而行自由商制者，固屬不少，然開放之區，零星散佈，前後左右，俱屬引岸有定，無由自由運銷，故名義雖云開放，其處於封銷狀態依然也。除開放而為自由商者外，有專商，有包商，有官運者，有官專賣者，其區劃之複雜，正所謂莫可名狀。然我人試一爲分柝，則專商之制，行鹽區域有定，運銷額數，亦有限制，事實上已超過統制之限度遠矣，特其統制之枚，在於專利之商，而不在政府已耳。至於包商，則全由商人認額承辦，在其區域之內，任承辦商人之殺鷄烹狗，任意上下鹽價，政府不但無過問之權，且有設置稅警，爲保護包商專利之義務。而其實際，與政府專賣無異，特其專賣之權，在包辦之商人已耳。至於官運官賣，已爲統制之極度發揮矣，復何待於統制。是以總觀我國鹽制，若專商包商與及官述官銷，早已逾越統制之範圍，所能施以統制者，特開放後之自由運銷區域而已耳。然此等區域，旣零星散佈於各地，且尤多爲數個行鹽區域接壤之地帶，其鹽之來源，並無定向，果因統制而限制其來源，則是併自　運銷之區而重反於全國均行包商專商或官運官賣之時代已耳。果不限定其來源，則又何有於統制哉。故此非能通之道也。然即使行而能通，是亦開倒車之事也。今日舉國要求，在於鹽區之開放，今乃反其道而行之，將經已開放之區，再行封閉，寗非逆行舟之事，故即使此道得通，亦斷乎不能行也。</p>
<p>若謂統制之區，不止在於已開放之區域，而在於全國，則試問在官運官銷制度之上，復何所施其統制：在專商包商之嘔，則政府旣已與商家以包辦或專管之權矣，又何從而加以統制。是以倘統制之對象爲全國則又病在根本無從實施矣。抑原倡議者之意或係在全國全行開放爲自由商制之後，再行統制，則又　其爲超時代之論。今日最要者在促使自由運銷制度之普遍成立，促使新鹽法之早日見諸實行，至於自由運銷制度成立後之統制，此時尙無由談及也。且斯時旣無外貨傾銷，政府又就塲監督微稅，即可隨時施行統制，事極易舉，我人此時，大可不必預爲之謀也。</p>
<p>故我人認為鹽之統制，實無可能，亦無必要。至如假美名以謀重課租稅，則非我人所討論之範國矣。惟人民之負担鹽稅，其重已到不可言狀，不聞淡食之貧苦民衆，隨地而有乎。黃台之瓜，那堪再摘，此我人斤斤以為不可也。總之，今日鹽之所以成為惡政，絕非在於無統制。鹽政之眞正弊端何在，今後之出路何在，願再進而論之。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>今日鹽政之最大弊端，就政府之財政立塲論之，其最要之點有三：一爲私鹽之充斥市塲，侵害餉鹽之銷路，使政府之收入减少。政府要彌補此項損失，勢必更抬高鹽稅，然鹽稅愈髙，私運者愈有利可圖，鹽梟私運之風愈熾，政府之收人愈受影響。二爲營私中飽制度之存在，侵触政府之收入。三爲緝私範圍過度，人力費用，兩不經濟，且因私販之風大盛，緝私愈不能不嚴，費用支出愈多。再就人民之立塲言之，重要者亦有三端：一爲鹽稅負担之奇重，使許多民衆，無力購買，因而不得不淡食或購用硝鹽。二爲負担之不公平，鹽區之劃分基嚴，鄰封相視，宛如異國，有尺土之隔而鹽佈相差值十數倍者。三爲政府之過度干涉，政府爲嚴行鹽區之制，全國各地，無不是緝私區域，在人民視之，實爲過分之壓迫。</p>
<p>上面六點，實爲今日鹽政之大病所在。然細老此六大弊端之發生。全由於行鹽制度之複雜與引岸制度之存在所致。鹽區旣複雜錯誤，行鹽之務，又或包或專或官。各不相同，價格因以髙低不一，且因鹽區之分劃，不合目前之交通系統，運費相差甚遠，鹽價之懸殊益甚，利之所驅，私運之風乃熾。又因鹽區複雜，鹽稅之徵收制度不一，用人旣多，肖小乃能　入，且徵收機關複雜散漫，稽核審查不易。中飽營私之事，因以無從避免。再行鹽區錯雜全國，緝私機關不得不全國林立，使鹽警之數，幾於可與維持治安之警察相埒，凡此三端，均基於鹽區與鹽制之複雜而起者也。論人民方面，所受鹽區鹽制不同之毒尤深。在專商包商制度之下，商人爲利慾所驅，何能問及人民之死活。鹽價在其操縱壟斷之下，自由升降，小民國以無　類矣。至於負担之不公平，稅警之過度干涉，更全基於鹽區鹽制之錯綜複雜而存在，無待多淪矣。所以千端萬緒，歸根到底，都是由於鹽制之複雜與鹽區之錯誤。今口切中時弊之政，就是在於廢止此種爲一切罪惡之源之行鹽制度與行監區域。斯則新鹽法之立即施行善矣。我人所以又要再三請當局注意者，鹽政之改革，鹽政之出路，在於已成立之新鹽法，而不在於任何其他驚髙名而無當於實際之計劃。須知今日鹽政之爲害，已不在當年厘金之下。政府能以最大之力廢絕厘金制度，鹽制之政革，豈獨無力以免成之乎，必不然也。</p>
<h3>改革聲中的中國鹽稅</h3>
<p>— 杜勞</p>
<p>上次五中全會，中委陳聚英等提議尅日成立鹽政改革委員會，並限一年以內實行鹽法；同時鹽務稽核總所又在提議統制食鹽，業已引起各界注意。因此，關於鹽稅和鹽法的大概情形，有向讀者介紹的必要。</p>
<p>中國的鹽稅徵收因受借欵條約束縛，也同關稅一樣向受列强控制；每年從鹽稅收入撥付的借欵本息，計逹一千萬元。北伐完成以後，國民政府就同鹽務稽核總辦開始談判，結果鹽務稽核所在名義上變成財政部的直屬機關，並於十七年年底把稽核總所從北平搬到上海。</p>
<p>此後兩年中間，在內戰之中停頓的許多稽核分所相繼恢復，鹽務逐漸恢復常態。這時內戰雖仍　次爆發，割據的局面在事實上也未完全消滅；但是鹽稅收入，仍能一年一年增加起來。東北被佔以後，鹽稅收入跟着激急减本；但在最近兩年之中又已恢復常態。</p>
<p>二十年六月，國民政府公佈新鹽法·新鹽法一共包括下列七章：一·總則，二·生產，三·貯藏，四·鹽塲鹽價，五·鹽稅徵收，六·鹽務機關，七·附則。在鹽法第一條中，規定鹽稅應在產地徵收；人民可以自由買賣食鹽，不准任何商人壟斷鹽業。鹽稅分三等徵收：一·食用鹽，每百公斤徵稅五元；二·漁川鹽，每百公斤徵稅三角；三·工業農業用鹽免收鹽稅；以上各項，一律不准帶徵附　。</p>
<p>鹽的生產也由政府嚴密管理·根據鹽法第十條之規定，政府應在鹽塲設法限制鹽的生產及每年產量，使全國鹽的生產和消廢能够互相適合。那些產鹽極少，或者過分分散，不便管理的鹽塲，如果政府認爲沒有設置必要，可以取消域令合併。政府應在鹽塲的適宜地點建築鹽棧，以作貯鹽之用；禁止私人設棧藏鹽。鹽務官吏負責微詢鹽塲代表意見，規定鹽價。鹽法第三十三條規定設立鹽政署，和鹽務稽核總所同樣由財政部直轄。鹽政署　　鹽　行政　項，組織鹽警，管理鹽棧，並檢查，收受，及發還食鹽。鹽務總稽核所負賣徵收稅欵，監督食鹽收受，並塡具報吿。又據鹽法第三十七條之規定，還要設立一個鹽政改革委員會，直受行政院管轄，來解决鹽稅的改革問題。</p>
<p>在政府方面，對於鹽務的改革，總算已經苦心　劃；可是絲毫不見實行。新鹽法的公佈雖然已經超過三年，到今還是一張不兌現的支票。鹽稅的統一，遠在民國二年已有這樣的煌煌法令（臨時政府所公佈的第四十三號命令）；二十年的新鹽法目的也在統一鹽稅，但總不能實現。在一九三三年（二十二年），全國消費食鹽總額之中有百分之一七·八每担徵收鹽稅一元以下；百分之二八·三每担徵稅一元至三元；百分之三四·七每担徵稅三元至六元；百分之六·五每祖徵稅六元至九元；還有百分之一二·七担徵稅九元至十二元。鹽稅稅率非但省與省異；就在一省之中也不相同。至於帶徵附捐，更加無法取消。下列數字吿訴我們，鹽稅附捐在一九三三年的政府進欵之中仍佔重要地位：</p>
<p>一九三三年的鹽稅收入</p>
<p>（一）中央政府的正稅和附捐　二八、〇一二、九四九·〇三元</p>
<p>（二）各省雀　　的　　　一九</p>
<p>（三）外債附捐　七、八一五、一六五·一〇</p>
<p>（四）雜稅　五、七二七、九〇七·〇六元</p>
<p>（五）其它　五、八五七、一六〇·七九元</p>
<p>總計　五六、八八一、二六〇·〇三元</p>
<p>財政部在二十一年曾將鹽務行政工作設法移交鹽務稽所的工作人員辦理；而以鹽務稽核總所部辦朱庭祺兼長鹽務總署，各地鹽務稽核分所的華籍官吏也多兼任　運局長，運副督銷局長，以及鹽務行政緝私等職。各鹽務署多被廢除，或被合併。財政部的此項辦法曾得行政院之核准，結果頗為圓滿；鹽務行政的工作效率旣被提高，行政經費又見減省。二十一年鹽務稽核總所的報吿曾稱「此項集權辦法提高工作效率，同時由於合併駢枝機關，得以節省經作效率，同時由於合併駢枝機關，得以節省經費，消除陋規，减輕食鹽成本，便利運銷」。或者不是謊話。</p>
<p>關於鹽稅收入所保證的外債，往往不能如期償付。從一九二八至一九三三年間，只有中英借欵從二百七十五萬金鎊减至一百五十萬金鎊；此外各種外債絲毫沒有减少。</p>
<p>一九二八年末　一九三三年末</p>
<p>中英借欵（一九〇八）　二、七五〇、〇〇〇　二五〇、〇〇〇　一、五〇〇、〇〇〇　二五〇、〇〇〇鎊</p>
<p>鐵道借欵（一九一一）　五、六三六、七九〇　一三〇、二六〇　五、六三六、八六〇　五五七、二六一鎊</p>
<p>臨時政府借欵（一九一二）　四、五八四、一七五　一〇〇、八五二　四、五八四、一五七　一、〇七四、二八〇鎊</p>
<p>靑島庫劵　一三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇　三、五〇〇、〇〇〇　一三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇　七、五〇〇、〇〇〇鎊</p>
<p>九千六百萬元借欵　三一、四七八、四〇〇　二〇、一九九、九〇〇　三一、四七八、四〇〇　三二、四七八、四〇〇鎊</p>
<p>（日本之部）</p>
<p>如上所述，鹽稅在中國政府收入中間佔有重要地位；確實，它是中國財政的第二個柱石。在二十三年度（一九三四年七月至一九三五年六月）的中央預算中間，鹽稅收入計有一九〇，三五三，八五一元，關稅收入計有三六六，四一三，七九一元，而國民政府的總收入則爲九一八，一一一，〇三四元。這樣看來，關稅鹽稅兩項收入，要佔國民政府全部收入的百會有一大都份放在貧苦人民的瘦弱的肩膀之上。</p>
<p>簡接稅在中國所以佔有異常重要地位，無疑地同政治的不統一和社會的不安定有密切聯擊。在歐美各國，簡接稅已被公認爲惡劣的收稅方法，常常受人指摘。但在中國，要使政府依賴直接稅來抵價巨大開支，還是一個不可能的夢想。現在我們所敢仰望於政府的，只是廢除苛雜，統一稅率；這雖是政府早已尤許全國人民的工作，但是切實完成，仍有待於將來。</p>
<h3>讀鹽務統計報吿書撮要後</h3>
<p>— 陳勉之</p>
<p>我國鹽務，歷史悠久，積弊亦深。民衆受切膚之痛，猶不知鹽務爲何物。談改革者，又好髙騖遠，未能切中時　。乃在比鹽務改革聲中，鹽務稽核總所，編印「鹽務稽核所統計報吿書撮要」一書，詳述民國以來鹽務情形，頗有使吾人注意之價値。日前承該所總辦朱庭祺氏寄一册，展誦之餘，使吾人窺見該所內容之一斑。書爲該所總編輯左君樹珍編撰，對近年整理鹽務之歷史，詳述無遺。其中尤以收稅及放鹽統計一章，列舉各項統計，證明稽核所之成績。雖所列數宇，容有不甚完備之處，要亦足供一般研究鹽務者之參考。該書第一章，　述民二以前鹽務機關之狀况，就塲產·放鹽·稅率·鹽欵各項爲前鹽務機關之黑暗情形，擇要指出，頗爲確當。鹽爲利藪，亦爲弊窟·觀者益信。第二章稽核所成立後之效率，共分四個時期敘述，（一）開辦時期，（民國二年至六年，）（二）組織完成時期，（民國匕年至十二時），（三）地方當局干涉時期，（民國十三年至年），（四）恢復及整理時期，（民國十八年至二十二年）。限於篇幅，茲從略。該書第三章收稅及放鹽統計，將二十年來鹽稅收入及放鹽數目，分四個時期，列舉數字，以示盈虚消長之原因。並以稽核所兼辦行政緝私各區，及未兼辦行政緝私各區，略作比較，以證稽核所兼辦行政排私後稅收進步經費縮减之精况。惟表內僅列百分比，未有詳確數字，難使讀者深知底蘊。　稽核所歷年經費開支實在情形，外間知者極　，種種誤會，往往由此而生，似應將歷年實支及結存之數，作一有價値之統計，俾一般人士得明瞭稽核所之實際狀况。左君對該所第四時期，即所謂恢復及整理時期，稅收總數之增多，認爲雖與稅率之提高，不無關係，而其激增原因，歸功於稽核所之整理。此種論斷。在表面親之，似頗有理。如將歷年稅收及放鹽數目，加以整個的研究，則所謂稅收激增，非特與稅率提髙，不無關係，假令目下之稅率，仍照第一時期平均稅率計算，行見稅收將有極大之低落，此則由近年放鹽數目反見縮減一點，即可確切證明者也。茲將民國三年至二十二年之稅收·放鹽·及平均稅率·按照該書所分之四個時期，列表如左，以明稅收盈虚消長之實在原因。</p>
<p>民國三年至二十二年稅收放鹽及平均稅率總表</p>
<p>（附註）（一）表內所列數字，以稽核所經管者爲限。</p>
<p>（二）二十年至二十二年各年份稅收及放鹽數內之東三省數目，係按十八十九兩年之平均數列入。</p>
<p>（三）表內所列平均稅率，因歷年各區稅率統計不全，係就放鹽及稅收數計算而得。</p>
<p>（四）自二十二年改秤後，稅率隨之增高，茲以數字不全，暫不列入。</p>
<p>觀右表所列各個時期稅收總數，除第三期外，大都逐年遞增。但如以此稱增加加之數，遽據爲整理之成績，未免誤解。蓋表內所列放鹽數目，固未見增多。試以民國二十二年與十一及十二兩年相較，則反有减縮之現象。放鹽旣有减無增，稅收激增，自另有其原因，此則一觀表內平均稅率之提高，即可了然。表內所示平均稅率，在第一時期每担二元六角三分，第二時期每担二元五角三分，第三時期每担二元一角五分，第四時期每担突增至四元。二十三平實行改秤後，稅率增髙，又爲人所共知。由此可見稅率提髙，實爲稅收激增之主因，不言而喩。而左君竟忽視此點，直使人難於索解矣。至稽核所已兼辦行政，緝私各區稅收增加之原因，雖與局部整理，不無關係，但如福建長蘆等區，因種種關係，稅收一落千丈，足見稅收增减，並不完全以兼辦行政緝私與否爲轉移。換言之，如環境十分惡劣之時，雖兼辦亦未必有效，而環境好轉時，雖不兼辦亦當有較良成績，他如淮北一區，在各區中較爲差强人意，放鹽情况，頗有良好之進步，但此種進步原因並不單純，銷塲擴大，亦爲一因，蓋折年淮鹽運銷潞鹽川鹽引岸者，亦復不少也。</p>
<p>稽核所經費開支實况，外間知者械尠，前已言之。該書未將此項數字，　量採入，最爲可憾。據吾人所知，稽核所經費之龐大，遠非其他政府機關所能比擬。在第一時期，平均年支一百六十萬弱，第二時期，平均年支三百九十萬弱，第三時期平均年支六百五十餘萬，第四時期除養老金，準備金，稅警團等經費外，平均年支六百卅餘萬，若以上述各項經費完全計入，則本均年支必在一千五百萬以上，由此可見第四時期之經費，較前激增，確爲事實。至該所因寬定預算，結餘之欵，爲數亦鉅，以　備金　義，存於滬行，此項准備金，聞前曾　馴　一度　開　會計二次澈查，仍未能知其確數，不知然否？但以歷年　核所公布之經費數目，與其實支數，略作比較，則每年結存一二百萬元，自屬可能之事。稽核所當局，如以此項數字，列成一表，實爲最有價値之事也。</p>
<p>稅收放鹽及經費諸端，前已論之。該書末章所述稽核所之改革情形，及關正誤會各點，語多重複，似無加以評論之必要。至所舉稽核所之優點，雖語焉不詳，平情而論，稽核所在吾國稅收機關中，尙屬較有成績，該所總辦朱庭祺氏，以改革鹽務自任，其精神亦有爲他人所不及者。茲本春秋責備賢者之義，略有建議，以供採擇。</p>
<p>（一）謀改進　稽核所旣有其相當成績，應專在整理鹽務上做工夫，不必效法流俗，徒事宣傳。對於研究鹽務有所建議，應誠意接受，不可動輒指爲毀謗。今後新任人員，須先行外放，經一番歷鍊後，再予較髙位置。原有之考試制度，尤應嚴格保持，以杜倖進，而予低級員司以按步擢升之機會。</p>
<p>（二）節經費　稽核所經費之龐大、確為不可掩之事實。最近立法院審議二十三年度國家總預算時，對鹽務費一項，亦認爲有切實核减之必要。故今後該所經費，應就可能範圍內，極力縮減，以符節流原則。如各項津貼可取消，薪額過髙者减低，人員重複者可裁汰，機關駢枝者可歸併，開支浮濫者可剔除，他如職位保障，及發給養老金等，原爲稽核所之優點，仍應保持，以養其廉。惟養老金應於退職時一次發給，以符名實。現在往往三四年發給一次，實類意外之加薪。</p>
<p>（三）裕稅源　據專家佔計，吾國每年銷鹽總額，應在五千萬担以上。而近年銷額，平均不及四千萬担，則漏稅私鹽，實有五分之二强。足見從前緝私不力，以致各區私鹽，仍復充斥。而私鹽充斥之另一重大原因，厥爲稅率過重，換言之，今之加稅政策，實無異獎勵販私，故欲正本淸源，以謀鹽稅之進步，必須减稅以敵私，使民衆有價廉之官鹽可食，則私鹽之銷路自絕，販私者旣無利可圖，自亦不甘作此有干法紀之生涯矣。至緝私之亟宜改善，亦須同時並舉。査近年緝私經費，頗見增加，而成效鮮有可覩。今後對於各區稅警應有適當之編配，緝私工作，尤須各守範圍，不可操切從事，激成事變，如最近之大名崇明等案可爲殷鑑。總之欲，消滅私鹽，以裕稅源，　武力徒，决難收效，尤須釜底抽薪，以謀根本解决者也。</p>
<p>上述數點，僅就目前切要者言之。至根本問題，如原定政制，實行鹽法　論，最近五中全會及立法院，均有縝密之討論。五中全會議决限期施行鹽法及組織鹽政改革委員會等案，在全國民衆渴望改革鹽務之時，允爲切要之圖。立法院議，設鹽政司，厘定政制，節减經費，亦屬切中時弊之律讓，惟冀政府能於最短期間，毅然决然，督促實行之而已。</p>

<h3>不是人身攻擊</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>前幾天看到林　雋先生的「又是雜文」，也是「並答」我的，我實在不敢相信林先生前後五六篇非難雜文的大作，都是從「無意之間」流出來的。如果其中的確參雜了一點有意，則無論其爲管見」或是「髙論」，大家都有加以批評的權利。</p>
<p>我不曾引證林先生大作的全文，那是事實。但實際上我也無法把全篇都抄了出來。如果我眞是在攻槃林先生，那末，我是在攻擊他的意見，並不是人身。我是在攻擊他對於雜文的整個意見，也並不是一篇二篇文章。</p>
<p>倘說目前沒有優秀的雜文，那應該是作家的才力問題，並不是雜文的體裁問題。然而林先生一向就駡雜文的短小，說牠「鷄另狗碎」，說牠代替了「嚴肅的工作」。但他又「决不是一個形式主義的機械論者」。這實在費解。好像也是林先生吧，他曾經以爲去年是雜文盛行的一年，而這雜文的盛行，據說還妨礙了偉大的作品的產生，所以到現在他還堅持着：「雜文越是伸張，雜文家越是輩出，偉大的作品就越是不容易出現。」林先生所說的偉大的作品，是只限於他所欽許的小說，詩歌，戲劇的。去年旣然沒有偉大的小說，詩歌，戲劇出現，那末，這重大的責任，似乎也只好落在盛行的雜文的肩上了。林先生不是也承認雜文的「蓬勃」，而且還以爲牠是「小成」麼？</p>
<p>然而，現在他又不相信了。這實在奇「怪」。</p>
<p>雜文家並不希望用一篇短短的文章去表現整個社會，他們只希望能够忠實地表現了牠的一枝一節，因爲把一枝一節連起來，也就等於整個社社會了。林先生旣然以爲「用希望偉大的作品的產生來希望這些寫寫雜文的雜文家，是絕對不可能的」，則可見「無窮無盡的呈獻在作者的周遭等待我們去採取一的可以做小說，詩歌，戲劇的豐富的題材，也只好讓菲薄雜文的偉大的作家去採取了。然而他又責問著雜文家：「何以結果僅只拿出一點點的幾乎不算是文爇創作的雜文來呢？」</p>
<p>林先生以爲雜文家絕對寫不出偉大的作品來，但又要他們寫出來。雜文家沒有把豐富的題材來寫小說，詩歌，戲劇，因此挨駡；鄙薄雜文的林先生也沒有寫，但他郤因此駡人。難道這又是在幹什麽「嚴肅的工作」麽？不，他其實是在搗「鬼」。</p>
<p>於是，我們要用「照妖鏡」了。</p>
<p>林先生再三再四地用雜文來表示他瞧不起雜文，已經成了周知的事實。這回他說：「偉大的作品是發育在瞧不起雜文的存在的另一種作者的頭腦中的。」不錯，林先生是最瞧不起雜文的，所以：「偉大的作品是發育在瞧不起雜文的存在的林希雋的頭腦中的」。</p>
<h3>人與書</h3>
<p>— 寒峯</p>
<p>「水滸」評</p>
<p>维新運動以後，以較新的眼光論小說者頗不乏人。梁啟超固集友人對於小說之見解爲「小說叢話」於「新小說」上，在另一主要的刋物「小說林」上，亦連載了「蠻」的「小說小話」，要面亦有許多很重要的小說史料。其論評部分，有評「水滸」一則云：「水滸一書，純是社會主義，其推重一百八人，可謂至矣。自有歷史以來，未有以百餘人組織政府，人人皆有平等之資格，而不失其秩序，人人皆有獨立之才幹，而不枉其委用者也。山泊一局，幾於烏託邦矣。曰忠義堂，盡己之謂忠，行而宣之之謂義，固逈異乎本書石秀所駡之奴奴，及石頭記怡紅公子所謂濁氣者之忠義也、。曰體天行道，山泊所出死力而保謎，揮多金以羅致者，固社會所欲得而馨香之尸祝之也。山泊所腐心切齒，而切其首啖其肉者，固社會所欲得而唾駡之投畀之者也。社會之心，天心也，且更取山泊之團體與趙氏之政府而　比較之，呼保義與道君皇帝，孰英明孰昏暗乎？智多星小李廣等與蔡太師　　　　　尉輩，　　　　　　？花石綱生辰綱之斂萬民膏血，以資一二人之欲，與揮金如土求賢若不及者，孰是孰非孰得孰失乎？仁和龔自珍曰：京師如鼠壤，則山中之壁壘堅。卽此日之現象也。耐庵痛心疾首於數千年之專制政府，而又不敢斥言之，乃借宋元以來相傳一百有八人之違事，而一消其塊壘，而金采乃以孫復胡安國之徽纏加之，豈不可怪哉！」此其起始一段也，其論調與平子等論金瓶頗有相似之處，而其寫作此文之用意，也更露骨，顯然是當時排滿的革命思想的反映，如當時也有爲藝術而藝術之羣，大約也有人要站起來說，這是政論而不是文藝批評吧。故其論「金瓶」，亦曰：「惟熟於肓腐二史者心知之，固不能爲賦六合歎三恨者之徒言也。」維新期之作家，無論在小說，在彈詞，以及在其他方面，其反映思想主張方法，大都類是。</p>
<p>阻新學</p>
<p>維新運動發生以後，新舊思想的衝突，表現得和每個時代一樣的激烈。南亭亭長的名著「文明小史」第四十二回，就說到關於書籍方面的事。說南京有一個康太尊，反對新學甚烈。他這一年「看見上海報上，還刻着許多的新書名目，無非是勸人家自由平等的一派話頭」，他「想這種書　　　　　少年人瞧見了‘把他們的性質引誘壞了，還了得！」他想：「我現在辦的這些學堂，全靠着壓制手段，部勒一他們。倘若他們一個個都一講起平等來，不聽我的節一制，這差使還能當嗎？現一在正本淸源之法，第一先要禁掉這些書。書店裏不准賣，學堂裏不准看，庶幾人心或者有個挽回。」所以在「學堂裏的學生，你也去買，我也去買，」一書店「應接不暇，利市三倍」的時候，便「驀地裏跑進來多少包着頭，穿着號子的人，把買書的主顧一齊趕掉，在架子上儘着亂搜。看見有些不順眼的書，一齊拿了就走。單把書拿了去還不算，又把店裏、的老闆，或是管賬的，也一把拖了就走，而且把賬簿也拿了去，一拖拖到江寗府衙門。」一共拖去十三家書店裏二三十個人。經過許多麻煩，纔被「勒令衆書店主人，具一張永遠不敢販賣此等劣書，違甘重辦的切結，然後准其取保回去。所有搜出來的各書，一律放在江寗府大堂底下，由康太尊親自看着，付之一炬，統通銷燬。然後又把各書名揭示通衢，永遠禁止販買。康太尊還恐怕各學堂學生，有些少年，或不免偸看此等書籍，於是又普下一紙諭單，呌各監督各敎習曉諭學生，如有誤買於前，准其自首，將書呈燬，免其置　　如不自首，將來倘被査出，不但革逐出堂，還要從重治罪。」當時新舊思想衝突的情形，這是一幅極清晰的描繪。</p>
<h3>攔車鎭速寫</h3>
<p>— 劉白羽</p>
<p>—太行山上—</p>
<p>得……得……</p>
<p>驢子的蹄聲，穿過一片搖拽的樺樹林子，殘陽紅光，正斜在半天空中，遠近的山峯，深淺的輸廓漸漸的消滅了，糢糊在一片沾灰的靑色裏。一片片大石塊吻着的山路，從樹林裏吐出來。淡紅的落葉，在亂石上　　的咽語。棉團似的山羊在牧人的鞭子拍…拍……聲中，緣着山坡滾得看不見了。</p>
<p>叮噹……叮噹……</p>
<p>細碎的鈴聲遠遠順風送來……細微……輕脆。</p>
<p>上面是雲影，下面更密密的什麽也看不見，太陽縮下山頭去，東面燒出幾塊紅霞，一個山頂上，……一縷……一縷的炊烟從一家小小的草屋頂上吹出來。</p>
<p>「這攔車鎭，是孔子被攔車的地方嗎？」</p>
<p>「是呀……我們得看一看」。</p>
<p>我聽着後面的人聲，——又一陣軍歌自遠而來，—太行山上—</p>
<p>一行續進的馱子，像一條繩隨着山路彎曲走進亂木深處，在疏落的樹根下，移動着驟子的短脚……黑……白。</p>
<p>轉過山去，一面石牌坊立在兩塊巨巖之問，天色已竞黑得看不淸横額上的殘字了。一條延長的碎石路，拖着兩旁的草房，漸漸消滅在零亂的山影裏去了，四下一望，山峯全把頭低在暮靄中，原來我們是站在太行山的絕壁上了。</p>
<p>沉靜的山的深村裏，被這一隊　子忽然衝來，打破了黄昏時候原有的冷寂。</p>
<p>三間黑得地獄似的房子，被上面的山岩，壓得低低的伏着，一個黄豆大的亮光，在那隻石柱上，照着舖滿了稻草的土坑，我和朋友們拉開了褥子躺在上面。</p>
<p>小的柴木桌上，擺着粗黑的凉饃，幾碗吐出熱氣的白水。在黑影裏，一陣一陣嘴唇……唼……唼……的響。</p>
<h3>奴性憎惡者</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>我十三歲那年，常常跑到　橋菜摥去買菜。那兒除了兩旁的破爛的房子和不齊整的道路之外，可以呌做特點的，是一條長年塗着濕泥，泥裏面拌和着魚鱗，霉爛了的菜帮和扁草的，齷齪的麻石路。</p>
<p>充滿菜塲裏的人——尤其是女人，使那里添加許多尖銳的喧閙；而那些對自己的貨物的稱贊，講價的爭吵，又混成一片使人感到疲倦的噪音，跟人們一道在路上隨處跑。</p>
<p>在茂源猪肉舖門前擺攤子的是一個賣靑菜的，有着一雙灰暗眼睛的老頭子。從他那衰敗的面皮和遲緩的動作看起來，一他起碼是七十歲的人了。他乾一瘦的身上，被重疊的，使人再一不能分辨出是那一民族的服裝底破絮覆　着。頭上那又黄又黑的海虎　　，和腳上那雙滋透的草鞋，彷彿使老人凝固在那張小木凳上面了。他俯低了頭，動都不動地坐着，要是沒有人問他價錢，他永遠不會抬起頭來。常常，他用一種憤怒的又像厭惡的眼色，望一望買菜的女人們，然後用很短的聲音回答人家。</p>
<p>「大槪，他是靠這付怪脾氣起家的！」我常常聽見許多女人對他批評着。</p>
<p>開頭，有好幾次我還了他價錢，他睬也沒睬我，又低卜頭去了，但很快，我就捉住了他底脾氣：沒有跟他多講，給了相當的價錢在他手裏，他就會一聲不響地收好了銅板，有時還用不淸楚的俏皮話駡我。往後，我就這樣跟他交易起來，而且因此相熟了，常常跑到他家裏去。</p>
<p>他不喜歡饒舌，只是用駡人的口氣對婦人們說：「我看你揀一天也揀不到一把合意的。或者，「人家要吃飯的呀！」……有時候他把雙脚伸開擺作八字形，低下頭來削芋頭，但從來不肯用眼睛關照他左右兩旁的菜籮的，彷彿他只是一個頂不負責的夥計，被逼着出來看守這個菜攤子；他也像是孤零零地坐在僻靜的地方，在他周圍什麽東西都沒有；總之，他並沒有預備到　兒來做生意。</p>
<p>他居住在一條小巷裏面，一閒充滿褐色光綫的後房。一邊房子，差不多擺滿菜籮，其餘底一邊就擺一付板床，一張既不像茶儿也不像斗凳的矮木桌，黄泥風爐，和雜亂的殘缺的零星用具。老頭子蹬在屋子裏却事務地忙碌着，用兩條腿在菜籮附近走動，又常常遲鈍地彎下腰來，好像那才是他跟他底貨物親熱的時候。</p>
<p>那一次我跑到他那兒，已經是下午五點鐘的時候了。他坐在一堆小磚塊上面，對住擱着一鍋菜的風爐，一隻手拿着酒杯，其餘一隻手握着筷子在吃他底晚餐。他沒有起來招呼我，表示我已經是他底老朋友了。我照例走到菜籮旁邊，動手挑選着，從　底翻到上面。他生氣了，做出站起來想打人的姿勢恐嚇我，並且用侮辱的口吻指着我說：</p>
<p>「沒用的傢伙，再長幾年吧，再吃多十幾担米吧，就跟她們一樣了！女人—說起來也討厭呢！」（未完）</p>
<h3>悒鬱</h3>
<p>— 岡</p>
<p>當代若干知識靑年常患着時代的悒鬱症。</p>
<p>看到洋爐里面熊熊的火舌在舐着爐門，他門打了個寒戰。他門董得他門的年紀還輕，靑春之火正紅，不應該就這麽樣自暴自棄，整天蜷伏在暖暖而却潮潮的屋隅里，讓悒鬱之火燒爛自己的生機。可是，他們還是悒鬱下去，生活不曾提供他們以必需的毅力和勇氣。</p>
<p>他們懂得世界正在向那一個方向轉動，他們也看到横在他們自身的前路上的危機。他們也像若干向着槍口和牢獄追求光明的人們一樣，憧憬着未來的世界。可是，他們身上的壞的特徵和他們生活在里面的壞的氛圍限制了他們，他們沒有勇氣和毅力向前跨一步。內心的矛盾爆發了苦鬭：自身只能長遠地停留在用羨慕和敬仰的眼光向別人投射的階段麽？自身是一個短視的俗物主義者麽？自身是一個懦夫麽？他們自己不能也且不敢給答案。於是，他們悒鬱了。</p>
<p>在深冬的深夜里，他們會因受不住悒鬱的悶重的壓迫而逃到屋外，迎着砭骨的寒風在迷濛的冷淸淸的古道上拖着笨重的脚步亂蕩，尋求刺激以引起一時的病態興奮。蕩倦歸來，依然賸着渾身悒鬱。</p>
<p>浮浪人的生活，葡萄酒和咖啡，只有使內心的悒鬱纏結得更緊些。每一念及生活生活，振作振作，內心定必一震，內心的矛盾　必又起　　番　　。然　，咳了一聲又復依然悒鬱下去。在沒落的邊界上掙扎是很吃力的啊！</p>
<p>對於這種患時代悒鬱症的靑年，你不能不責備他們，却又不能怎樣苛責他們。那是歷史上的問題。時代悒鬱症的牢固的病根，是歷史生出來的。這種病根，比不得飄忽易散的輕烟樣的愁雲，它，只有在歷史的洪爐里才燒得掉！（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>阮玲玉事件</h3>
<p>— 玄珠</p>
<p>在艾霞自殺一週年之後的現在，在盛大的紀念國際婦女節的今天，我們又見到中國惟一天才影星阮玲玉服毒的新聞。</p>
<p>據平時的傳聞，據報章的記載，現在證之以她的遺書，阮玲玉的自殺，爲了訟案問題無疑，而訟案的來由是爲了婚姻。</p>
<p>這件訟案在沒有結束以前，暫時無庸我們來討論，是非曲直，自有水落石出的一天。不過讀了她的二封遺書，覺到骨哽在喉，不得不吐。阮玲玉出身寒微，這已是人所共知的事，張達明就在那時候，加以小惠把她的身體佔據過來，或許內中還有複雜的情形是我們局外人所不知道的，總之是包含着若干「以身報答」的封建餘毒。然而阮玲玉是覺悟了，（雖然她還是受了變相的欺騙）據律師證明簽訂脫離同居關係的契約，在對方的條件下，無論在法律，良心，老是「公平交易」的事。但是看她的遺書中「……可是他恩將仇報，以冤來報德，更加以外界不明，還以爲我對他不住……」這其間的文章，就包藏着犧牲阮玲玉的原因，這可怕的輿論！這可怕的社會！</p>
<p>生在現時代不幸而是一個女子，從感覺到自身的苦痛而眼見着許多在矛盾中掙扎不出一個頭緒，終於以自殺來不了了之的事件，深深地覺得婦女們要在這個男性社會中殺出一條血路是何等的困難！</p>
<h3>火葬</h3>
<p>— 江天</p>
<p>午後的太陽，溫柔的看着大地，村裏是沉靜着。</p>
<p>李阿保那已經是快五十歲的老頭子，這時在那柔媚底陽光下的路上走着。冬天的嚴冷地風已消逝無踪，在這春天的午後，天氣是顯得格外溫暖了。可是李阿保，他雖穿着那麼一件很厚的破棉襖，但他還縮緊着頸勃，好像很冷似的抖擻着。</p>
<p>沉重的脚步在動着，一樣沉重的心也在跳着，他那已經快要變成麻木了的腦袋，是再也不能容許他去想像什麼了。他簡像一個僵屍，在這沉靜的午後的村莊裏，到處的走動着。</p>
<p>他那蒼黑焦瘦地臉，縐紋是一條條凹落得很淸楚，眼眶深深的露出着兩隻昏黃色的眼瞳，頭髮散亂的蓬鬆着，雙撮灰色的鬍子，好似亂草一樣地很不整齊的蓋住着　巴、那有點兒駝的身軀，走起路來就好　是　跌下去。他東　到過了西巷，村南走到村北，看看是快到黃昏的時候了，太陽已溜在村西那幾株幾百年的大榕樹梢上，金黃色的光輝在他那昏黃色的眼珠前閃耀，他那再不敢想的念頭，又在他的心頭浮頭出來，使他很不自然的從肚子裏吐湧出一口酸的泡沫。</p>
<p>「看看這情境，今天也找不到一點東西下肚了。」</p>
<p>他終於想起這個念頭來，他一想到吃東西，肚子裏就更加的感到饑餓地咕哩咕嚕的響着。他，自從在鎭上乞了兩天嘗吃過那兩碗冷飯之後，到今天，算起來已是三天沒吃過一粒米了，昨天是吃了兩隻很小的饅頭，直到現在可還沒一點東西下肚，酸溜溜的口水，從肚子裏湧出來又吞下去。到了現在，他的腿也跑得麻木的再也很難站住了</p>
<p>「今天鈸上的育嬰堂，聽說退了二十幾個嬰兒不收，說是已經滿了，還有幾個退出來之後却絕氣了。」</p>
<p>「哼，這年頭大人還活不了，小孩子生下來也只有就死回去，難道誰還養　　　？死了倒乾凈些哩！」</p>
<p>兩個年靑人的談話，衝進季阿保的耳朶裏，這使他的心更加的沉重起來，他在想，這年頭兒窮人生什麼兒子！</p>
<p>「……很多的人自盡哩！上吊的，投井的吃毒藥的，還有用刀戳死的。昨天鎮上還餓死一個老頭子……」</p>
<p>很刺耳地，兩個靑年人的尖銳地聲音突然地衝破進李阿保的耳膜裏來，他心裏感到一陣很大的壓迫，他不敢再聽聽下去，拖起着沉重無力的腿，一步步的望着攸那一問再也賣不掉的唯一的家產草屋走去，頭合身子還是那末緊縮地抖擻着。</p>
<p>夜，展開着它的外衣蓋上了大地，這沉靜的村子裏是更加的死寂了。春天的虫聲雖沒有秋虫那末尖銳地整夜的狂鳴，但在這村子裏，這四面都是空地和亂草的李阿保的草屋，在這沉沉幽靜地夜裏，那虫聲還很淸楚的刺進李阿保這快五千歲的老頭兒的將　地耳朶裏，他閉緊着眼睛，急促而微地喘息着，麻脾了的腦袋合失去了熱血的心，令他再不能有些微的感覺和想像。他那抖顫的手，緊捻着一根自來火，準備着夜深了的時候，擦亮着屋中的雜亂的乾草，捨棄了生命，跳出了世界的火葬了。</p>
<h3>過瞿塘峽</h3>
<p>— 季子</p>
<p>早晨。</p>
<p>十二月的險沉的天空，擺出一副嚴肅，懊喪的苦臉。</p>
<p>大江兩旁凸凹的山地上，疎疎落落的幾所人家茅屋的屋頂上，冒出了縷縷的炊烟，雞公站在牆垣上伸長頸子喔喔地啼着，靠近江岸的漁舟上，漁婦們點水烏似地跪在船弦上洗刷尿罐，老頭子無精打采地蹲在船頭上打呵欠，嘴裏不時地吐出烟子。迪遭怪靜溢的，沒有人聲，烏唱，猿啼，只遠遠的不時發出一陣陣的鋸子聲——山那邊的樵子。</p>
<p>順流中的長江輪「疾走如烟」地行駛過白帝城脚下，漸漸像給鋼又剌傷的海馬慢吞吞地在水上容與着，隨着她的脈搏也越發跳動得厲害了。輪輪船上的汽笛好像沒給戳穿喉管的垂死的老牛斷績地嗚咽着。白茫茫的浪花圍繞在船的四週嘩啦啦地怒吼，游擊兵似地用牠白沫唾擊着船身，船兒給牠打擊得週身哆嗦，大江兩旁巨人船的嶙峋的石壁，給牠激蕩，震撼得彷彿快要坍倒下來似的，前面，遠遠的嵯峨的巫山十二峯的乳頭般的山頭也在雲宵裏顫動着。輪船在動蕩，山嶽在動蕩，草木也在動蕩。一切都爲着狂暴的浪花而戰慄，一切都爲着洶湧的波濤而動搖，唯有流浪的人兒好像習慣了過驚風駭浪與飄搖不定的生活，心兒老是那麼的平靜，平靜得活像一湖死水。</p>
<p>輪船沿着那羊腸般的多灘險的江上緩緩地前進着，走不到多遠，突然間，恍惚前面兩旁的大山長合攏來阻住了航路，江流也就從那終兒止了，這時候，沒有旅行經騐的人往住會驚訝與着急地呆　着前面，深怕船過不去，但是看看要絕路了，一轉灣，一下子又現出一個廣闊淼茫的江面來。就這樣，不知道要遇逢多少個窮途，轉多少個灣，才能走出峽口。</p>
<p>—這象徵着漂泊者的前途啊！</p>
<p>我老是這麼地想着，在凄凉的旅况之下的寂寞心兒，每每從這兒獲得了一些安慰。的確，漂泊者的前途「九洲何處不羊腸」呢！不過，道路儘管牠崎嶇，儘管牠艱險，只要你能冒險地勇敢前進，又何嘗尋不着坦直的大道。</p>
<p>我抱着一顆興奮，活躍快棄的心兒走出了險隘的瞿塘峽。</p>

<h3>好萊塢兩位童星傑克古柏與蕭麗鄧波兒的薪水（上）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>據最近的調查，好萊塢　打的小明星的每星期薪水的總數，是五干四百十元。其中賺錢最多的兩個小明星是傑克古柏（Jackie　Gooper）和蕭麗鄧波兒（Shirley　Temple）。傑克古柏每星期的薪水是一千三百五十元。蕭　鄧波兒比他差一百元，每星期是一萬元的八分之一。但是倘使將蕭麗鄧波兒的母親所拿的津貼，每星期二百五十元的酬勞，叫她每天在攝影塲中照料她的女兒的，拿在蕭麗的薪水上，傑克古柏就相形見絀了一百五十元。</p>
<p>請讀者注意，這不過是最近不景氣中的現象，和從前十年以前吧，黃金時代的盛况，已經不可同日而語了。那時的童星，傑克第一世，就是「神童」賈克柯根（Jachie　Googan），和米高梅公司訂了連拍十張影片的合同。他除了薪俸之外，還要出品上的贏利，並且由米高梅担保，每張片子的酬勞，十二萬五千兀，並且預支五十萬元，作爲四張影片的酬勞。拍十張片子，光以薪水而論，已經美金一百二十五萬，合華幣四百餘萬，數目也可驚人了。在那個時候，小明星的錢，都給柯根一個人拿去了。其餘的小儔伴所拿的，不過三百，五百，總共不到一千元。</p>
<p>不過傑克柯根亦不是電影史上第一個賺大薪水的童星。在傑克沒有上銀幕之前，好萊塢早就有一位童星，他的作品在讀者之中年齡較長的或者曾經看見過。那就是鼻子上生滿雀斑的那僩瘦長的孩子。他的名字叫威斯利巴萊（Wesley　Barry），蘭稱就叫「雀斑」（Freekles）。最早發現他的，是當時一位名道）演馬希爾納蘭（Marchall　Meilan）。他看出了他的價値，要想和他訂立一張三年的長期合同，先結他每週七十五元的薪水，每年增加一倍。照這樣算來，他第二年的薪水，就是每週一百五十兀，第三年每週三百元。</p>
<p>但是華納公司捷足先登，竟在納蘭的合同沒有訂立之先，將這個「雀斑」威斯利搶了過去，立即給他每週一千二百五十兀的大薪水。這在當時，可以算是破天荒的豪舉了。但是不久，笑匠却利卓別麟却又發現了「神童」傑克柯根。那時小神童年齡不過三歲，薪水起初不過每週一百五十元。但是自從他演過了「The　Kid」之後，他的一顆星就扶搖直上，而「雀斑」威斯利的星就沉下去了。</p>
<p>以上所講的，都還是十餘年前的事。現在我們且回到現代的兩位童星身上去。</p>
<p>傑克古柏或者賺不到這個數目，但是派拉蒙公司的一個主腦，因是眼光太淺了，却造就了傑克現在的地位。同樣的，蕭麗鄧波兒或者亦可賺更大的薪俸，和十年前的傑克柯根媲美一下，但是却因爲福斯公司的一個主腦，手腕太敏捷了，以致蕭麗無形中受了極大的損失。這兩個公司的當局，一個眼光淺近，一個手腕敏捷，講來是很有意思的。我們先講傑克古柏。</p>
<p>傑克古柏最初在哈爾羅區的滑稽片中表演的時候，每星期的薪水不過一百元。導講諾門泰羅將他借了來，拍攝派拉蒙的名片“Skippy”，亦就給他原有的薪水，每週一百兀。等到片子拍完了，諾門拍案叫絕起來，他知道那張片子一定會轟動一時的。他於是將那張片子，在試映室搖給派拉蒙的經理先生看。等到看完了，諾門泰羅開口道：「你如果要和這孩子簽訂長期合同的話，我可以將每週七百五十元的代價，弄他過來。你知道，我是那孩子的姑丈，我想道一點事，我可以替你辦到的」。</p>
<p>在諾門泰羅是一團熱誠，不想那位眼光如豆的經理，搖着頭說道：「我不要傑克古柏。我要那寶伯柯根。他一定會轟動起來的」。他醉心於「柯根」一僩名字，以爲會跟着「神童」傑克柯根，轟動起來的。他却看不出傑克表演的出神入化。後來米高梅公司當局我聽見了，立即從哈爾羅區的手裏，將傑克古柏搜羅了去。他們立即和他訂定了長期合同，每週薪金一千二百五十元。</p>
<p>蕭麗鄧波兒的事情，講起來更長，更離奇了。這裏爲篇幅的關係，祇可約略地敘述一下。總而言之，一般經手人的愚笨，遲鈍，坐失良機，說來是很可笑的。照樣的最可惜的，是派拉蒙公司。　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「銀影驚鴻」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>The　Corntess　of　Monte　Cristo　—大上海映</p>
<p>「臨時演員」這個名詞下生存着的無數人物生活的各方面，反映着整個動亂淆暗的社會的一切。由於關聯着電影這一綜錯藝術之綜錯的生產過程，所以臨時演員的生活也隨着綜錯得極戲劇性的。在爲藝術的美名下，他們或她們爲最低限度的生存上的必要物質，做着一切非人的事情，演着可歌可泣的眞實戲劇，這是一個比較地正視這一現實的作家，就可以寫成極深沉的成功作的。</p>
<p>這「銀影驚鴻」就是從臨時演員的生活中，展開來的戲劇，而因爲劇作者庸俗觀念的手法，不夠高明，把它弄得不三不四的了。</p>
<p>和一些沒有成功的片子同樣，這「銀影驚鴻」便吃虧在編劇的庸俗上。他輕輕地放過了自己已經接觸到的「銀影」黑暗面的這羣臨時演員的生活不寫，而強調在所謂「驚鴻」這點黃色新聞與軟軟的「鴻」之深處上，讓軟性者流來「驚」一下。於是呌兩位漂亮的臨時女演員綺娜與米米，由假的戲劇拍攝中，坐着一輛汽車溜了出去，在一個大旅館中，冒充了戲中假的Ccuntess　of　Monte　Cristo，演着多少不合理的胡鬧的假騙案。自然，這時在許多富紳的「驚鴻」者羣中，是不會缺少一位多情多能而且要奇突得使劇情有所謂曲折與刺激的奇男子的。於是一位名魯模夫司基的，說是二十年來所要緝拿的大盜出現了。在搬演犯罪的欺詐，狂歡的宴舞這幾套老調後，來了個驚險的破案，女的由一個舊情人記者施丹的營救出來了。因着這黃色新聞的轟動，女的！那個走出的臨時演員！就有名地被公司用作可以賺錢的明星，和記者熟吻者作結。</p>
<p>編劇上的欠通，是隨處都可見到的。主要的如爲後面的大團圓的尾巴，在前面硬安下一個記者，來作爲女的犯着不大不小的案子時的救急。</p>
<p>至於魯模夫司基的以一個久在緝拿的大盜土場等，都非常突兀。這眞是「萬金油主義」的編劇方式下的產品！！！！</p>
<p>好的地方，要算前面關於攝影塲中的幾段了。大導演的神氣，對大明星與臨時演員以及助手等的幾副面孔Studio的空氣，不但逼眞，而且極動人。</p>
<p>女主角費蕾的演技乃是可觀的，如做臨時演員時的失戀心情，困居大旅館中時的窮愁悲哀，都是很成功的。但是在出入交際塲中，與華貴的許多塲面中的演出，却是老調而沒有多少可取。演魯模夫司基的保爾路加司，那種豪闊生活中的盜俠氣概，倒是很夠味的。</p>

<h3>名片捲土重來「金銀島」和「一點靈犀」</h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>米高梅一九三四年度的名貴出品而在數月前曾鬨動海上影壇的這兩部巨片「金銀島」（Treasure　Island）和「一點靈犀　（Chained），據說現在又將在本埠映出了。</p>
<p>這兩部片子上次在「南京」開映的時候，有許多因爲觀衆擁擠以至未能庽目的影迷們，對於這種重映的機會，這實在不能不說是一個好消息。</p>
<p>我不想在這裹談一談關於影片的內容或情節。就據着華雷斯皮萊和賈克柯柏（「金銀島」主角）與瓊克勞馥和克拉克蓋博爾（「一點靈犀」主角）的過去光榮的成績，那是决不會使人失望的。尤其是我們的影評人已在數月前給了它公正的評價，是一個很好的證明。</p>
<p>但是觀衆們如果再將這樣的影片重映的機會錯掉，那確是有點可惜的。即使已經看過的觀衆們，亦無妨再來看兩遍，决不爲多也。</p>
<h3>貂斑華「踏入」影界</h3>
<p>貂斑華已在「新女性」上過鏡頭，而且博得讚譽，現在纔說她踏入影界，豈不是消息欠靈嗎？不，這是另有道理的：第一，她現身於「新女性」不過是一個嘗試，戲並不多，未能盡其所長，她的天才與美麗是要在「秋扇明燈」和「寒江落雁」裹纔有着充分的顯露的；第二，她在那二片裏面被任爲與主角黎莉莉及陳燕燕分庭抗禮的交際花角色，在編導的新穎手法之下，她的出塲的鏡頭就來得個聲聲喧赫，儀態萬方，眞的吻合着「踏入」的名義哩。</p>

<h3>威靈登軼事（The　Iron　Duke）（五）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>公爵夫人一面將小孩子趕走了，一面鄭重其事的對着威靈登道：「亞塞，我愁得很。我因爲你的部下感覺煩悶，所以籌備了這個跳舞會。但是倘使拿破侖的兵從天而降，那怎麼好呢？」威靈登聽了，不覺笑起來道：「哦，親愛的却珞蒂，堂堂一位英國的公爵夫人，怕那些作什麼？不過我肚子餓了。幾時吃飯吧？」公爵夫人道：「馬上就吃飯。我還要給你介紹一位年輕的夫人哩……」</p>
<p>威靈登道：「小心眼兒的？」他看着女人，都是那樣的。公爵夫人笑道：「很有些小心眼兒。你不知道，她已經愛上了你……」威緊登道：「不是愛上了我。大概是愛上了我的軍服」。公爵夫人又道：「你離開了英國，還沒有和吉蒂通過信嗎？」威靈登道：「我們向來不通信，祗是神交」。公爵夫人道：「我告訴你茀蘭茜斯夫人年紀很輕，很容易受衝動，再則她是有夫之婦。你可不要看上了她。一成靈登道：「你請放心，我看見了她祇會恨她」。</p>
<p>他們於是下了樓，走進了客廳。茀蘭茜斯雖然在彈著鋼琴，但是她的全身，都麻木冰冷，連指尖都凍僵了。她故意裝着鎭靜的態度，但是一位少女的裝作鎭靜，結果大半是適得其反。她聽見門響。她看見公爵夫人和一個男子走了進來。她站了起來。渾身覺得一種不可名狀的感覺。她想起了剛才所說的要暈過去的話。她心中明白現在站在她面前的，就是偉大的威靈登公爵。她耳聽得公爵夫人道：「茀蘭茜斯，這就是威靈登公爵。」</p>
<p>她聽了那句話之後，就覺得眼前一陣漆黑，頓時失了知覺，公爵夫人急忙搶前一步，將她抱住，她就人事不省的倒在她的懷裏了。威靈登嚇了一跳，連忙問道：「怎麼回事？」公爵夫人縐着眉道：「我想她是暈了。快拿聞藥來……英雄崇拜……小傻子……告訴你她年紀太輕，缺少意識。」威靈登覺得惶然道：「暈了？眞糟糕！這孩子相貌不差，是不是？」</p>
<p>過了兩天的晚上，立治蒙公爵夫人家裏開着跳舞大會。昔樂歡笑之聲，從室內散佈到外間充滿着恐怖的黑夜之中，如同波浪滔天的海上，霧夜行舟，遠遠望見燈塔微光，令人精神爲之一振。在不魯塞爾之南，距城不遠，就是拿破侖的法軍。但是在公爵夫人邸中光滑的地板上，威靈登的部屬軍官，却一個一個摟拘着軟語如綿的艷侶翩　地舞着，好像戰爭死亡還在數千里以外似的。</p>
<p>突然間音樂停止了。軍官們都立正了。婦女們大家都折着織腰，行着當時的敬禮。威靈登公爵笑容可掬地走了進來。他一面走，一面揮着手請大家繼續跳舞。他一直走過了大廳，走進了小內廳，那裏茀蘭茜斯勳爵夫人獨自一個人坐着。她的芳心狂躍着。她的嬌軀又感覺一陣不可名狀的麻木和微寒。威靈登站定了，看着她，然後鞠着躬。他指着她身旁一個座位道：「我可以……」茀蘭茜斯笑道：「請坐，請坐。你看，今天我膽子大些了。我頭一次看見你就暈了，我想你一定會僥恕我的」。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Complete Collapse of Xu’s Bandits</h3>
<p>Bandits in the Yunwu Mountain Area of Mian County Have Been Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>(Xi’an) Xu Xiangqian’s bandit forces, defeated by our army, have been fiercely suppressed by troops dispatched by Sun Wei-ru via multiple routes since the 11th. The bandits have suffered heavy losses and are reported to have completely collapsed. Only a small number of scattered bandits remain in Ningqiang. The rest of the bandit forces, led by Xu, have fled south. The 99th Regiment of the Western Route pursuit troops, under the command of Battalion Commander Liu Weicheng, led their troops to advance toward the northwest mountains about 50 li from Mian County at dawn on the 8th to search for and eliminate bandits. Reaching Yunwu Mountain, they encountered a bandit guerrilla force of about 100 men. The battalion immediately surrounded them and launched a fierce attack. After three hours of intense fighting, the bandits were completely disarmed. Over 70 bandits were killed on the spot, and over 100 firearms were seized. The bandits in the Yunwu Mountain area have now been completely eliminated. (Central News Agency telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yang Yaofang has dispatched troops to Shaanxi to assist the Jing Gao and other units in suppressing bandits. They are still setting off in succession. Yang seized over 100 rifles, 4,000 rounds of ammunition, and other military supplies from bandits in Kelan. Today, he dispatched personnel to transport them to Taiyuan and hand them over to the Pacification Headquarters. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Yang Yongtai and Others Arrive in Chongqing; Chairman Chiang Personally Sails to Greet Them</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Soong Mei-ling aboard the "Yong You" steamer and Yang Yongtai, Chen Fang, Pan Boying, and others aboard the "Minzhu" steamer, escorted by the "Ba Yu" warship, arrived in Chongqing at 2:00 PM on the 10th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally sailed 30 li down the river by steamer to greet them. Liu Xiang and his wife, along with leading figures from the party, government, and military, as well as thousands of female students, warmly welcomed them at the Chaotianmen pier in light rain. Chiang and his wife disembarked amidst military music and traveled by car to the Fan Village headquarters for rest. Liu Xiang and others also followed to meet and converse with them. Yang Yongtai and others stayed at the Zeng Jia Yan Tang residence. Yang Yongtai told a Central News Agency reporter that the scenery on both sides of the Sichuan River was extremely magnificent, proving the saying that the Shu Road is difficult has been overcome by ship. He felt extremely gratified along the way. The land on the high mountains on both sides had all been cultivated, showing the diligence of the Sichuanese people. He believed that after the bandits were suppressed, Sichuan would make a great contribution to the work of national revival. Furthermore, Qiu Jia, the representative of the 21st Army, also arrived on the "Minzhu" steamer. (Central News Agency telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang has again ordered the heads of provincial and municipal governments, departments, and bureaus of Henan and Hubei to go to Jiangxi to inspect construction, paying attention to matters such as requisitioning labor, dredging rivers, building dikes, land reclamation, and economic cooperation. The special education facilities in the bandit areas can be used as a reference for various provinces and cities to adapt and implement according to local conditions. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After the establishment of the Army Reorganization Office of the Headquarters, two deputy directors will be appointed. The candidates have all been determined. In addition, two committees will be attached. Wei Yisan and others will serve as members, and Zhu Huaibing has also been appointed to an important position. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chiang Kai-shek's wife arrived here today, and the public warmly welcomed her. From the riverside to Chiang's residence, troops were stationed along the way for protection. In the past week, Chairman Chiang has been investigating the military situation here and planning the suppression of the communists. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>He Jian Arrives in Yuanling to Plan Military Suppression of Bandits</h3>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian arrived in Yuanling at Shen time (3-5 pm) on the 9th to plan the suppression of bandits in Hunan and Guizhou. The Chen Quzhen division has completed its reorganization and assessment. He has appointed Li Keda, Gu Jiaqi, and Zhou Xieqing as brigade commanders of the division. He sent He Haoruo to Chongqing to discuss bandit suppression. Hu Shuhua went to Sichuan on the 10th at the invitation of Liu Xiang. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) A telegram from Taoyuan stated that Division Commander Li Jue led his troops to advance from Xiyikou and encountered communist bandits entrenched in the Sanshengdu area on the Yong Bian border. We launched a three-pronged attack on the bandits. The troops advanced simultaneously and engaged in fierce fighting, killing over 600 bandits, capturing over 100, and seizing over 200 long and short firearms. The remaining bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated to the Hongbiyan area near Tankou during the night. Our army has occupied the ferry crossing and is now joining forces with friendly forces to advance swiftly and eliminate the bandits. The scattered bandits in the local area have now been completely eliminated. (Central News Agency telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Zoned Clearance in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun issued an order on the 10th to the special commissioners of each zone in Hubei Province, requiring them to complete the zoned clearance by the end of May. After completion, they should also order the security teams, militia teams, and volunteer teams to effectively assist the people in self-defense and resettle refugees to eliminate the source of bandits. (Special telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Lu Dipin's Funeral Held Yesterday; Central Government Dignitaries All Attended to Pay Their Respects</h3>

<h3>Escalation of Civil Strife in Xiao and Su Counties</h3>
<p>Residents of Su County Flood Xiao and Ling Counties and the Western Bank of Su County</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A large-scale civil strife was triggered between Xiao and Su counties due to the issue of dredging the Kui River in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The people of Su County were defeated by Xiao. As armed resistance was ineffective, they resorted to harming their neighbors by digging up the Baishan levee downstream of the Kui River, flooding Xiao and Ling counties and the western bank of Su County, in an attempt to escalate the situation and force the counties of Ling and Su to jointly resist Xiao. On the 8th, several thousand residents on the west bank of the Kui River gathered and attacked Liujia Village on the east bank of the Kui River. The villagers of Liujia Village were unprepared and suffered a crushing defeat with many deaths and injuries, and countless food was looted. The people on the east bank of Su County were greatly angered and also gathered several thousand people to counterattack at noon on the 10th. They are currently still in a stalemate at Sunjia Village. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties, creating a situation of internal strife. At the same time, the residents of Lingbi County in Anhui Province also harbored ill feelings towards the people on the west bank of Kui River in Su County and prepared to join the battle group on the east bank of Su County to counterattack the west bank.

<h3>British Side Is Studying in Detail Investment Plan for China; If Japan Is Unwilling to Participate, Britain and the United States Will Proceed Alone</h3>
<p>(London) Reliable sources here stated today that if Japan is unwilling to participate in the international investment plan for China, Britain and the United States will provide loans to China on their own without any other assistance. There is still no way to grasp the official opinion on this matter, but those close to the government say that this matter is currently under detailed study, and China, Britain, and Japan are also in practical contact. (National telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States is still paying close attention to China's financial crisis today. Observers predict that countries around the world will soon jointly review China's poverty and the extent of its need for foreign debt. It is heard that some officials in Washington still do not believe that China's predicament will have any concrete impact after borrowing foreign debt. Some people even think that China does not need loans, or that if the United States lends to China, it will inevitably propose that experts manage it. Others believe that the United States may require China to reform its customs system, because after the customs system is reformed, China can solve everything without raising foreign debt. Representatives of the Washington mining industry have expressed their opinions that if China adopts a managed currency system policy, it can only be implemented in the treaty ports. The majority of the people will still keep their traditional silver ingots. The industrial sector said that international investment in China can benefit the silver industry, but in any case, the world silver price will rise. According to the opinions of some experts, China's reaction to the US silver purchase plan has greatly reduced the amount of silver purchased by the Ministry of Finance. The business community still wants to raise the price of silver to US$1.29 per ounce, but this move has been blocked by those who want the government to adopt a global attitude towards the silver issue.

<h3>London Newspapers Comment on the Far East Issue: Japan: Return or Suicide?</h3>
<p>(London) The Observer published a long article today discussing the complex problems in the Far East. It first discusses the possibility of a solution, assuming that the annexation of Manchuria is tolerated, and that Japan's demands regarding Inner Mongolia are accepted in part. Regarding China, the main point of contention is whether Japan, while not admitting that it intends to exercise arbitrary control and unlimited aggression against China, is satisfied with sufficient guarantees regarding China's future economic security. If Japan can rely on these conditions for ten years of peace, then Japan can guarantee the world ten years of security. If Japan refuses, it is tantamount to committing suicide. Japan has now forced Soviet Russia to become a great military power. Does the policy of the Japanese government want to force the United States into a great air force, and force the British Empire to reorganize and assess all its great potential? Once this kind of military force against Japan is fully utilized, the Chinese people will inevitably rise up to resist Japan. Its oppression of China will result in Japan's destruction and its failure to remain a "great power" and commercial country. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Contract for the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Be Formally Signed on Schedule; Effective on the 22nd</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Chinese Eastern Railway representatives Kozlovsky and Ktzni met with Togo, Director of the Eurasian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the afternoon of the 9th. As a result of various negotiations, the final agreement on the articles of the transfer agreement of the railway has been completed. Therefore, it is scheduled to be temporarily initialed by Foreign Minister Hirota, Soviet Ambassador Yurenev, and "Manchukuo" Minister Ding Shiyuan in the Minister's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 PM on the 12th. The items that should be signed temporarily are roughly as follows: (1) Basic agreement between Manchukuo and the Soviet Union regarding the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway; (2) Official documents exchanged between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding payment guarantees; (3) Protocol of the Price Ruling Committee between Japan, Manchukuo, and the Soviet Union. After the temporary initialing on the 12th, the above-mentioned documents will be submitted to the Review Committee of the Privy Council for review on the 15th, and then submitted to the regular meeting of the Privy Council for decision on the 20th. After that, a formal signing ceremony will be held at the Foreign Minister's residence on the 22nd, gathering representatives from the three countries. The agreement will take effect at the same time as the signing. All management of the Chinese Eastern Railway should be formally transferred to the "Manchukuo" from that date onwards. After the formal initialing of the agreement, the first portion of the transfer price of 13 million yuan must be paid. How the payment will be made will inevitably have a considerable impact on the Japanese exchange rate, which is attracting the attention of the general public. The Soviet side hopes to pay the price in British legal tender, but it is heard that the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the parties concerned at the Yokohama Specie Bank have reached a full understanding on this point. However, leaving aside what exchange rate will be used to pay the foreign currency price, it is clear that the Yokohama Specie Bank will use the foreign currency it holds to make the payment. As for the worries about directly putting pressure on the exchange rate, it seems that they will not occur. (Jiji telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Siamese Coup and Its Oppression of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since the Siamese revolution in June 1932, two and a half years have passed. During this period, although the situation has remained stable, the waves caused by the revolution have occurred several times. For example, on June 20, 1933, Army Minister Phahon Phonphayuhasena took advantage of the King's absence from the country to stage a second coup, consolidating power in himself. Later that year, the left-wing political leader Pridi Banomyong returned to the country and planned another uprising, causing several days of unrest. Then, last winter, Prime Minister Phahon Phonphayuhasena, during a session of parliament, passed a bill restricting the King's power to grant pardons for capital punishment. This led to increased tension between the King and the current government. At that time, the King of Siam was in England and indicated that if the Siamese authorities insisted on this bill, he would not hesitate to abdicate the throne. Although the Siamese authorities later sent a representative to England to persuade the King not to give up the throne, it was to no avail. Now, it is heard that the King has abdicated, which should be a major upheaval since the first revolution.</p>
<p>The abdicated King received his education in England in his early years, so he was greatly influenced by British political thought. During the Siamese revolution in 1932, the King was quite tolerant of the members of the People's Party, and he immediately approved the constitution proposed by the People's Party without hesitation. This shows that he deeply sympathized with the revolution. Even when Phahon Phonphayuhasena staged the second coup, the King did not oppose it. This shows that the King was not an autocratic or power-hungry person. It was only after the Siamese authorities restricted the King's power to grant pardons for capital punishment last year that the King became indignant and even fought to the point of abdication. Examining the content of this bill, it stipulates that after a criminal receives a death sentence, they have sixty days to request a pardon from the King. If the King obtains the countersignature of the Prime Minister, he can exercise the power of pardon. However, after this deadline, even if the King wants to grant a pardon, he is powerless. The intention is obviously to transfer the King's power of pardon to the Prime Minister. This is self-evident. From then on, the Prime Minister would wield the power of life and death, and his prestige would naturally increase greatly. If he wanted to abuse his power to eliminate dissidents, it would be very easy. Therefore, the King believed that this was depriving him of his special power to protect the lives of the people. He was willing to sacrifice the throne, but he would never allow this special power to be given up. He also advocated that this bill be put to a popular referendum, saying that his special powers could be entrusted to the people, but not to a small number of individuals or political parties. It can be seen that the King placed great importance on public opinion. According to recent European news, the conditions for reinstatement proposed by the King are all essential elements for a democratic political system. It is truly admirable for a monarch to have such a democratic spirit. Siam's loss of such an enlightened monarch is certainly a loss. Whether or not this will brew other changes is something we do not need to worry about. What we cannot help but say is the oppression of our overseas Chinese since the Siamese revolution. According to our newspaper's Siam correspondent, the oppression of our overseas Chinese by the Siamese authorities in the past two years has been appalling. Initially, overseas Chinese schools were ordered to teach Siamese, up to twenty-one hours per week. At the same time, the total teaching time was limited to no more than twenty-eight hours. This meant that only seven hours were left for teaching all other subjects besides Siamese, making it impossible for people to have the time or opportunity to teach their native language. The second step was to restrict Chinese teachers, requiring them to be proficient in Siamese. Recently, Chinese children aged seven to fourteen have been forced to transfer to Siamese schools. Furthermore, publications from our country to Siam are strictly prohibited, preventing our overseas Chinese from self-improvement. They are not allowed to assemble freely, and they are not allowed to commemorate national holidays. Everything they do is aimed at forcing our overseas Chinese to forget their motherland and assimilate with Siam. Siam is a descendant of the Shan people, who originally lived south of the Yangtze River in our country. Due to the southward expansion of Han Chinese power, they migrated to the Malay Peninsula. Even today, although their script is phoneticized using Brahmi script, it is essentially similar to our language in many ways. The most notable examples are basic numbers and names, which are mostly the same as ours. It was only after entering the Malay Peninsula and coming into contact with Indian civilization that they failed to be completely assimilated by us. Since the Ming Dynasty, the number of Chinese people going to Siam has been increasing, and today, the Han Chinese component in the Siamese bloodline accounts for more than 60%. Therefore, judging from reason, it would not be an exaggeration to say that modern Siam is our vassal state. Yet, they have forgotten their ancestors and want to assimilate our compatriots, which is going too far. Even if our compatriots in Siam are not considered overseas citizens, they should be considered a minority group. According to today's international conventions, minority groups are entitled to cultural freedom, which is almost a matter of course. How can Siam disregard the rights of our compatriots in this way? In addition to our indignation, we sincerely hope that they can improve their practices voluntarily, and our government authorities have a responsibility to protect the people, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Turkey and Bulgaria Plan Direct Negotiations to Explain Attitude Towards Greece; Greece Launches Second General Offensive Against Rebels; Official Announcement of Victory</h3>
<p>Athens: Since the revolution in Greece and the deployment of troops by Turkey and Bulgaria on the border, the situation in the Balkans has become tense, with a danger of imminent explosion. Recently, Turkey and Bulgaria have planned to hold direct negotiations to clarify their attitudes towards the Greek coup. Although the situation is still fraught with danger, it has greatly eased compared to the past few days. To facilitate these talks, the Bulgarian representative in Geneva has sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, withdrawing Bulgaria's recent protest against Turkey's massive deployment of troops in Eastern Thrace. Italy has also formally denied supporting the Greek rebels or inciting Bulgaria's ambition to reach the Aegean Sea. This is also a comforting development. With the danger of an outbreak in the Balkans averted, the attention of the general public is focused on Greece. The Greek government has been severely hampered by the recent cold weather and has been unable to display its military prowess. This morning, it launched the first phase of its general offensive in the Struma area of Macedonia, first with artillery bombardment of enemy positions, and then with aircraft machine-gunning rebel gatherings from the air. Several aircraft flew very low, and good results must have been achieved. Government forces Commander-in-Chief General Kondylis personally supervised the battle at the front line. At the same time, three bombers flew to Crete to bomb the rebel barracks in Rethymno and Heraklion. At the time, an oil tanker entering the port of Heraklion was also targeted by the aircraft. After completing their destruction work, the aircraft dropped government leaflets advising the people of the island. The rebel flagship Averoff was hit by one aircraft and suffered heavy damage. Meanwhile, according to news from Ankara, the Governor of Mytilene and two Greek parliamentarians took a small boat and risked traveling seventy miles. Although they were bombarded by the Venizelist party, they safely arrived in Smyrna, Turkey. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Athens: The government and rebel forces are now fully employing modern tactics. Many innocent people in Greek cities are now being affected. It is reported that Thessaloniki was bombed by the navy and air force, and the heavy artillery fire has caused alarm among the local population. It is estimated that more than a thousand soldiers have died. According to unofficial reports, the rebels have gathered a force of 100,000 to fight the government forces. The sound of artillery fire from the Macedonian front could be heard this morning on the Yugoslav border, indicating that the government forces have launched another attack in that direction. However, by noon, the artillery fire had ceased. Twelve government aircraft bombed and strafed the railway line along Serres and Drama to prevent the movement of rebel troops. The government is now strictly censoring outgoing news in order to prevent the leakage of truth. British, Italian, and French warships are still in Greek territorial waters to protect their citizens. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Thirty Greek Aircraft Bomb Rebel Positions, Troops Launch Immediate Assault</h3>
<p>Athens: The Athens News Agency issued a message stating that government troops in Eastern Macedonia launched a general offensive against the rebels this morning. The offensive began with thirty aircraft bombing rebel positions. Government troops then advanced rapidly, passing through the Oriago Bridge and occupying the village of Poro Vatates without resistance. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Athens: The government air force is actively operating in Macedonia and has achieved considerable results. Several aircraft have bombed key locations on the rebel front to facilitate the army's advance. The rebel outposts have been unable to withstand the attack, and their positions have been shaken. In particular, the rebel barracks in Sidi, Rokastron suffered the most damage. Aircraft stationed in Thessaloniki and Serres also flew to Drama and Kavala to bomb rebel barracks. The rebels were caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. In addition, several aircraft flew to Heraklion and Rethymno in Crete to bomb the rebels and drop leaflets in those areas and the port of Ragani, urging the residents of Crete to abandon their rebellion and return to the right path. The weather has now cleared, and the government troops' actions are no longer hindered. It is hoped that the rebels will be defeated soon. Many communists have been arrested in Thessaloniki and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-German Berlin Conference: Hope for a New Date</h3>

<h3>German Economic Development</h3>
<p>(National News Agency German Correspondent) Germany has recently focused on labor issues. The intense work of the Labor Corps of the National Socialist Party is sufficient to promote economic development. A reporter visited Mr. Brandenburg, Director of the Communications Group of the Ministry of Labor, who said the following: Millions of young people in Germany are joyfully singing songs and going to factories on their own land to serve in useful work. Obviously, the organization of the Labor Corps is a great tool for practical education, a unique creation of the National Socialist Party. In addition, the services of the Labor Corps have extremely important economic significance. The food and clothing of these 250,000 young people are essential, so the money spent on these young people is the business of the majority. If there is talk of organizing new Labor Corps domestically, all cities and districts will join one after another. Labor Corps leader Schmidla recently gave a speech stating that the money spent on labor will greatly benefit the country's trade and industry. The annual increase can be, for example, 34 million marks for the textile and sewing industry, 12 million marks for the lumber industry and forestry, 4.5 million marks for the manufacture of wooden or metal utensils, and 50 million marks for the food industry. This is only a part of the economic importance of the Labor Corps. The value of the Labor Corps' work will become even more apparent in the future. It is often said that this kind of work has not been effective, and that laborers can only suppress the ordinary labor market. However, both of these claims are false. We must clearly understand this point, and it is necessary to judge the Labor Corps from a long-term perspective, from all aspects of the present and the future. The Labor Corps organization was purely created by the National Socialist Party. The purpose of the organization pays close attention to wage issues, ensuring that wage rates are not reduced and that other markets are not suppressed. Forty-eight percent of those who voluntarily join the Labor Corps are starting to improve arable land, 19 percent are engaged in road construction work, 8 percent are engaged in forestry, and 30 percent are preparing for land colonization. These are a total of 85 percent. Learners have undeniable value to the country and the economy itself. Several improvement plans of the Labor Corps' divisions are currently in progress. The following is a brief description to show their current status. The plan to cultivate 8,200 acres of peatland on the Bavarian Plateau began this year. The goal is to build 150 farms, each with 50 acres. In the small Schatte area between Lahr and Kehl in Baden, a drainage canal will be built. Although this canal is only four and a half miles long, its power can protect 100 acres of good farmland from flooding. 160,000 acres of land will be reclaimed southwest of Darmstadt for cultivation, divided into 500 farms and 3,300 horticultural farms. In the Brandenburg area, there are 214,000 acres of peatland, irrigated by the Rhine and Havel rivers, making it possible to cultivate. This work requires the joint work of 15 labor groups to complete. At present, governments of all countries are paying close attention to Germany's planned economic situation. The French periodical "Army and Democracy" recently published an article that concluded, "Germany's use of the Labor Corps may be sufficient to enable Germany to break its economic panic."</p>
<h3>Canada Establishes Central Bank</h3>
<p>Ottawa: Finance Minister Rhodes announced that Canada has today implemented a new financial plan in order to reduce the fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. Rhodes also said that starting Monday, the Central Bank of Canada will open for business across the country and directly lend money. The bank has $10,300,000 in cash and $600,000 in silver as reserves, which can assume a total liability of $22,500,000. In addition to the above-mentioned cash reserves, its total assets also include $15,140,000 in government securities. After the government starts lending money, it will deposit another $20,000,000 into the central bank as government deposits. In the future, the central bank will act as an agent for selling Canadian-produced cash abroad. However, the central bank itself does not buy it, because the gold reserves are sufficient for application. If the central bank buys cash, it should pay a price of 35 yuan per ounce. However, if the Canadian dollar can maintain its current value, it will only be recorded in the bank's books as 20 yuan and 67 cents. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

<h3>Cuba Under Martial Law; Government Deploys Troops to Suppress Strikes and Riots; Bombings and Gunfire Continue All Night, Traffic Cut Off</h3>
<p>Havana: Martial law has been declared throughout Cuba. Today, it is reported that bombings have occurred in various places, and government troops have responded with gunfire and bayonets. At least two people were shot and killed last night. President Mendieta's government has adopted an "iron fist" policy to eliminate the riots and strikes that have shaken the capital for several days. The President has now ordered the suspension of the constitution and mobilized reserve troops to strengthen the military. Inciters of riots may be executed when necessary. Groups of three or more people gathering on street corners may be considered to be opposing the government. The provincial governors have been appointed as military district commanders in their respective areas. The central government is temporarily formed by a joint committee of the Council of State and the Federal Cabinet. Military leaders announced that they are prepared to fight the strike leaders to the end. According to observers here, the current situation is the most chaotic in fifty years. Two hours after the government handed over the country to direct military rule, the situation suddenly became quiet, and the masses dispersed. Government leaders then claimed that the strike forces had been broken, and the President's representatives also stated that government workers had expressed their willingness to resume work. Therefore, it is expected that all government agencies will be able to operate as usual on Monday. However, strike activity soon resumed, and bombs were still found everywhere. More than fifty strikers have been arrested and imprisoned, and troops have opened fire. Gunfire continued all night yesterday. The government also organized motorized patrols to disperse crowds on the streets. Troops also searched everywhere and claimed to have seized many weapons. Politicians opposing the government have joined forces with the strikers to instigate unrest. Observers believe that the government's drastic actions were the initial cause of the school boycott. The subsequent strict censorship of news also led to the strike of newspaper reporters. Now, railway workers have also joined, so all traffic has been cut off. Some government officials said that if the strike leaders succeed, the government will request US intervention. The strikers said that they do not support the bombings, which are carried out by terrorists and radical elements in the political world. The current slogan of the strikers is "Down with military dictatorship," while the government's response is to increase military power and abolish the constitution. The United States has so far maintained a policy of non-intervention in this strike movement, and there has been no indication of any change in this policy recently. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Radek on Soviet Women</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, all newspapers, in commemoration of International Women's Day, are paying close attention to Soviet women and their numerous constructive activities. The newspapers are revealing statistical materials and interviews with female workers, collective farm women, female engineers, professors, teachers, and female athletes, contrasting the lives of women in the Soviet Union with those in the Tsarist era, pointing out the astonishing development of the former. Radek has an article published in Izvestia, titled "Women on the Stage of History," specifically discussing female collective farmers. The author points out that the October Revolution handed political power to the laborers and, at the same time, opened the path to women's freedom. The flames of the revolution burned away all prejudices regarding gender inequality. The proletarian state abolished all laws based on this inequality, stepping forward to defend women, allowing them to participate freely in the struggle and construction of a socialist society. Radek further stated, "Bourgeois democracy cannot grant women equality, even in form. Fascism proclaims that the world must be based on the 'way of men,' and it is driving women back into the kitchen. As for us, we are building a socialist human culture where men and women are completely equal." (TASS dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>The King of Siam Abdicates, Receives Unemployment Insurance, Earns US$40,000 Annually</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the abdication of the King of Siam, there is now a matter that other dethroned monarchs around the world may view with envy. It turns out that the King of Siam purchased unemployment insurance several years ago. Now, after abdicating, he will receive the first installment of the payment this week. When the British and French insurance companies insured the former King of Siam against unemployment, they looked around the world and saw many monarchs who had lost their thrones. Therefore, they set the initial premium at US$1 million. At the time, the King of Siam was wealthy with the entire country, so why would he be stingy with such a small amount? He continued to pay on schedule. Last week, when he abdicated and his nephew Ananda ascended the throne, he immediately received the payment from the insurance company. He will now net US$40,000 annually until the end of his natural life. (Kuomintang dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<h3>Thailand Forcibly Assimilates Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Correspondent from Thailand)</p>
<p>Chinese schools must teach Thai for 21 hours per week. All children aged seven to fourteen must attend Thai schools.</p>
<p>As I write this dispatch, tears cannot help but well up in my eyes, and I am heartbroken, because our overseas Chinese children will be assimilated in the future and will no longer be what they were.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Thai government used the excuse of compulsory education to order Chinese schools to teach Thai for 25 hours per week; otherwise, they would not be allowed to enroll students aged ten to fourteen. At that time, we overseas Chinese petitioned the Thai government and appealed to the country, but they still refused to allow it. Later, the American-run Trisarn School also requested, and they finally agreed to reduce the number of Thai language hours, but a week still has to have 21 hours and 15 minutes of Thai lessons, and the class hours per week must not exceed 28 hours and 45 minutes, leaving only seven and a half hours to teach Chinese. Some schools also have to teach some English, how is that enough? Therefore, we have to ask again, but the result was flatly rejected. What we won at that time was only "schools that follow compulsory education, Chinese teachers can be exempted from the Thai language test," but last year they intensified, not only reversing their previous statements, Chinese teachers still have to take the Thai language test, and only those who pass are allowed to teach, and they also sent people to secretly investigate in various places, and if there is any excuse, they will immediately close the school and never be allowed to reopen it. In a few days, as many as thirty or forty schools were closed in various places. In the southern part of the country, there are almost no Chinese schools in existence. Thousands of Chinese children have been forced to enter Thai schools to study Thai exclusively. The future result is definitely not what we dare to say, isn't it heartbreaking? As for the remaining Chinese schools, they are also in danger and may be closed at any time. As long as they have an excuse, they have to execute it, for example, the day before yesterday a Thai language teacher asked for leave due to illness, and the Chinese teacher went to the classroom to maintain order, and when they found out, they added you to a violation of the regulations, the crime of teaching more Chinese, and closed the school. Speaking of the Thai language test for Chinese teachers, and the matter of applying for registration, it is even more difficult to describe. Anyone who wants to register as a Chinese teacher must first go to the government to take the Thai test. It is necessary to find a teacher who has passed the Thai language test and has teaching experience. Some even have to learn English, isn't it difficult? Therefore, there is a great lack of teachers. The Thai government's examination is very strict, and even deliberately makes things difficult. Some take the test again and again, and can't find the way for a long time. All test papers from counties outside the capital must be submitted to the Ministry of Education in Bangkok for approval. It is very common for them to be put aside for three or four months. Before passing the test, you must not apply for registration. Registration is more troublesome than the test. You must bring your photo, resume, diploma, letter of introduction, self-recommendation letter, and insurance policy, together with the application from the board of directors, and submit them to the Ministry of Education for review. If the documents are not in Thai, you must attach a Thai translation. At the same time, you must also pay four baht of Thai currency (each baht is equivalent to one yuan and 34 cents of Chinese currency) to the county government to obtain a household registration certificate. If the government is not satisfied with him, it may not issue the certificate, and registration will be hopeless. Even if everything is done, it is impossible to wait for the approval of the Ministry of Education. Before the registration is approved, you must not take classes without authorization, otherwise the school will be closed. Now that the Chinese schools have reached such a dead end, the oppression can end here. But that's not the case. Oppression is only intensifying step by step. Chinese schools are still being closed continuously. Recently, they simply do not allow Chinese schools to enroll children aged seven to fourteen. All children in school who are seven to fourteen years old are ordered to drop out of school and transfer to Thai schools to study Thai exclusively and not learn Chinese anymore. Counties outside the capital have been forced to implement this. Think about it, students aged seven to fourteen are completely forced to drop out of school, so what schools are still open? Even if they are not closed, they will naturally close on their own. Do our children still have the opportunity to learn Chinese? Can our children still have the concept of their motherland? In less than twenty years, Chinese will disappear in Thailand. Isn't this a serious matter?</p>
<p>Or someone will say that after the Chinese schools are forced to close, we can let our children study at home by themselves, and not let them read Thai, which is better than letting them assimilate. But how many parents like this are there, and besides, children will not study by themselves. In order to oppress our children to assimilate, the Thai government further stipulates that if there are children who do not attend school to study Thai for six years (four years for girls) and pass the exam, they will be considered to have committed a crime. First, they will be fined 50 baht and imprisoned for five days, and then they will be fined double. If the children themselves are unwilling to study Thai, they will also be considered to have committed a crime. What can be done about this?</p>
<p>The various oppressions we suffer are naturally not limited to this. For example, according to the immigration law, if we enter Thailand for the first time, we must take the [unclear word] test and pay a tax of more than one hundred baht. Those under the age of 20 must be led by their parents before they are allowed to enter. If we who reside here want to [unclear word] to the country once, we must also pay a return tax of 20 baht, with a time limit of one year. If it expires, we will be treated as new guests and will be subject to the restrictions of the above-mentioned immigration law. Our children are forced to enlist in the army when they reach the age of 20 and serve in the military for three years. Our freedom has been deprived [unclear words]. For example,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>If we read publications from our country, such as newspapers, we are at risk of being detained or fined. We are not allowed to assemble or form societies, or even talk to people too much. Our anniversaries must first be approved by the government before we can raise flags. We cannot be too enthusiastic about public welfare, such as running Chinese schools and donating money back to our country, otherwise we will win the crime of being a communist. In addition, there are even more exorbitant taxes, such as political assistance fees (six baht per year), income tax, inheritance tax, etc. ... squeezing as much as possible. Now our children will all be forced to assimilate, so that they lose the concept of their motherland.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that we cannot forget. Last year, more than a hundred overseas Chinese in Mitong were arbitrarily killed by them, and as a result, they were displaced and lost their property, which is even more uncountable. Now there are still dozens of people imprisoned on the trumped-up charge of "perhaps have." We in Thailand still cannot figure out the truth of this matter, but the Thai government's propaganda that we are rebelling is definitely not something we can believe. Dear compatriots, please pity us, the fallen overseas Chinese in Thailand, support us unanimously, urge the government to actively negotiate, and save our children!</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Agreement and Germany (French Dispatch)</h3>
<p>In addition to building pocket battleships at sea, Germany's development of aviation aircraft is also not behind others. Germany's aircraft are ostensibly passenger-carrying commercial aircraft, seemingly unrelated to military affairs. However, by modifying a portion of the passenger seats, they can be quickly converted into military aircraft. The number of such passenger aircraft is as high as 1,300. The internal organization of companies like Luft Hansa is almost the same as that of the French Aviation Department, capable of exerting its unique efficiency. The import of air force military materials is no less than 15 million marks per year. The Wahlermund traffic flight school is, in reality, an air force officer training school. Germany's aviation routes are only 18,640 kilometers, but its flight performance is 1.219 million kilometers, 288,000 kilometers more than France.</p>
<p>According to the investigation of a certain expert on the French side, Germany's fighter planes and bombers are very modern and can be called aerial cruisers. The 400 bombers can each carry about three tons of bombs, which can drop 450 to 600 tons of bombs on the enemy. If France goes to war with Germany, Germany can use its 400 light bombers to drop 20 tons of bombs anywhere. Once the war starts, within eight or ten days, it can destroy 150 to 200 important cities of the opponent.</p>
<p>After receiving such reports, France understood that dealing with Germany was insufficient for France alone and that it must unite with other countries. Britain was also similarly stimulated, because, for example, the airborne spreading of germs, which had been tested in Soviet Russia, was very severe. In London, non-toxic mold was tested last year. The results of the test showed that in wartime, using 30 aircraft to spread poisonous bacteria would result in the complete annihilation of six million Londoners within seven hours. Therefore, Lord President of the Council Baldwin advocated that Britain's air defense should be extended from "Do-Far" to the Rhine River. To prevent the tragedy of air raids, expanding the air force is the most important thing at present, and it is necessary to consult with the air force countries of continental Europe.</p>
<p>This is the genesis of the Anglo-French air defense agreement. If Germany restores its former military strength, the first terror that Britain will feel is being attacked by the air force. If Britain concludes an air defense agreement with France, then Germany's attack on Britain will be subject to the constraints of the French Air Force, and Britain's city security will have an additional layer of protection. The difference between the Anglo-French agreement and the Locarno Security Treaty is that in the past, only Britain helped France's security, and France had no obligation to assist Britain's security. In other words, if France was subjected to armed aggression by Germany, Britain would provide assistance to Germany, but there were no provisions for Britain being invaded. However, according to this air defense agreement, if Britain is subjected to an air raid, the contracting countries must come out to assist. This is beneficial to Britain.</p>
<p>From the French perspective, the Locarno Security Treaty is outdated. Although there is no great gap between Britain and France in general, this treaty now needs to be revised. After the establishment of this Anglo-French air defense agreement, there is a new understanding between Britain and France regarding the overall European situation, namely, the reaffirmation of the Locarno Treaty. If France is attacked by the German Air Force, the British air force can immediately take action without waiting for the approval of the League of Nations Council. In this way, the "security guarantee" obtained by France is probably greater than that of Britain.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Anglo-French air defense agreement does not care about preventing Germany and also invites Germany to join, while also inviting Italy and Belgium to participate, just as the Eastern European Security Treaty wants to invite Germany and Poland to join. This is the strength of British diplomacy, but its inner goal is to target Germany. If Germany joins the agreement, it must also provide assistance if they are invaded. This is the difference between a new type of peacekeeping organization and an old-fashioned offensive and defensive alliance. In such an environment, Germany must not only deal with Britain and France but also pay attention to the attitudes of Italy, Belgium, the Soviet Union, and so on. If Germany joins them, it will inevitably be permanently bound by the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties. If it does not join, there is a danger of isolation. Therefore, from Germany's perspective, the establishment of this Anglo-French air defense agreement is still only one-sided in terms of European security.</p>
<h3>Inspection Record of the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Xinjiang's Transportation Situation</p>
<p>Xinjiang is a purely continental province, with deserts, vast plains, high mountains, and steep ridges, but very few large rivers and deep streams that can be used for navigation. Therefore, when discussing the province's transportation undertakings, water transport is not as important, and the development of land and air transport should be urgently sought. The current transportation situation in the province is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Aviation Route Plan: In the winter of this year, Mr. Li Jingcong of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation successfully test-flew the maiden voyage of the Pingdi section and prepared for operation. On December 15, 1932, the first round-trip flight between Shanghai and Tacheng was started, with one round-trip flight per week. There are three new stations in the plan: Tacheng, Dihua, and Hami. The route is 52 jade miles from Ta to Di, and 500 miles from Di to Ha, requiring a total of about 6.3 quarters of an hour. The entire line from Tacheng to Shanghai is 4,050 miles long, equivalent to 12,000 li in Chinese miles. Flying by station, it can be reached in four days, which is not only the most convenient tool for transportation between Xinjiang and the interior but also the only shortcut for Eurasia transportation. Unfortunately, the full line was interrupted by the war the following year. In the summer of 1934, the war in Xinjiang ended. The airline is still only open to the eastern section of Lanzhou. Recently, it was heard that the new province plans to handle the Tacheng-Hami section itself. The Hami-Lanzhou section is still extended by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation to Ha for connecting transport. This matter has been brewing for a long time. If it can be realized, the main artery of the country can be unimpeded.</p>
<p>2.  Postal and Telegraph Services: The wired telegraph bureau of Xinjiang Province was founded in the nineteenth year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty. Kashgar in the south, Yili in the west, Tacheng and Aletai in the north, and Hami in the east are all connected by wire networks, reaching inside and outside the province, and can also be used for short-distance telephone calls after generating electricity. However, the desert is desolate, the place is vast, and the telegraph poles have been in disrepair for many years, and they are easily broken by wind and rain. Gansu and Sui camel drivers, following the line for a long journey, if they see a complete porcelain bowl, they will remotely hit it with a stone, saying whether the future is good or bad can be determined in the middle. Ignorant aborigines also often cut lines to make bullets and cut poles for firewood, often repairing this and breaking that, which leads to the speed of telegrams sometimes being slower than postal delivery. Ordinary telegrams sent from Dihua to Beijing and Ping take three or four days quickly, and as long as three or four weeks if late. It is commonly called "camel telegram," which is not an exaggeration. Due to the depreciation of provincial banknotes, the telegraph fee has never actually received one corner per word. Although it is currently stipulated that each word costs 16 liang of provincial banknotes, it is only about three cents in silver dollars. If the local government does not maintain the expenses, the telegraph bureaus in various places will be unable to make ends meet and will have to close down. During the period of the Beijing government, the former Ministry of Communications set up a radio station each in Dihua and Kashgar in the eleventh and twelfth years of the Republic of China. Originally, Kashgar was intended to be connected to Dihua, and Dihua was connected to Kulun, Zhangjiakou, and Beiping for relay. Unexpectedly, Outer Mongolia became independent, and the Kulun radio station changed, so Pingdi could not directly reach it. Later, new machines were installed, and in the fourteenth year, the Liaoning radio station was connected, and in the fifteenth year, the Jinan station was connected, but it stopped at the Jinan station and was destroyed in the May 3rd Massacre. In the nineteenth year, the new provincial government added a short-wave radio station in Dihua, which could communicate with Taiyuan. In the 21st year, Qitai, Hami, Zhenxi, and Yanqi also each set up a station, and it was still planned to be set up in Yili, Tacheng, Kuche, and Guan. Aletai in each place, but due to the impact of war, many parts were donated and damaged. The Kashgar large radio station was also dismantled by Ma Zhongying's troops and taken to Hotan, which is especially regrettable. Now, the Dihua station has achieved very good results in communicating with the mainland, and with personnel improvements, the future is very promising. The postal service in Xinjiang Province is not as good as others. The main reason is still the impact of the decline in provincial banknotes. Therefore, Xinjiang postage stamps are printed with the words "Limited to Xinjiang Province for use" and cannot be sent to the mainland for application. The salaries of post office employees are less than one-tenth of their counterparts in the interior. For example, the postman east of Xingxing Gorge has a monthly salary of 40 or 50 yuan, while the postman west of the gorge gets 300 liang of provincial banknotes, which is only about seven or eight corners in silver dollars. Buying donkey iron hooves takes up half of it, and life is extremely difficult. The situation of the staff is also the same. How can they be held accountable for efficiency when they are hungry? In addition, in order to prevent the leakage of important internal information, the provincial authorities often send people to check postal letters, even if it is not wartime, which also affects business. In the autumn of 1934, the war ended, and the post offices in various counties were ordered to stop checking. The dawn of the future may be here. 3.  Highways: Most of the postal routes in Xinjiang are flat and spacious. With slight repairs, they can become highways and can be driven by cars. If it is Gobi hard sand, it can be naturally walked on. Expanding highways in Xinjiang, the important project is only bridges, which can be said to be more convenient than anything else. Those that are now open to traffic are: (1) the Dita Line, from Dihua to Tacheng, can be reached in two days, and the ticket price per person is about 30 yuan in silver dollars; (2) the Dika Line, after the war in 1934, the provincial government gradually expanded southward with military vehicles, and Aksu rice was saved due to the food panic in the Dihua area. Crossing the Russian border from Kashgar and Tacheng, taking the Tusi and Siberian trains, you can return to China in the east. (3) The Xinsui Line, from Dihua to Suiyuan via Mongolia, is operated by the Xinsui Long-distance Bus Company. The company is located in Tianjin, with its headquarters in Suiyuan, and branches in important towns along the line, as well as Hami and Dihua. It opened to traffic in October 1933 and was suspended for more than a year due to the impact of the war. It has now been restored, but the Dihua-Hami section is run by the provincial government itself, so that the company's cars can be interconnected in Hami. Suzhou has also newly established a branch, which also facilitates trade transportation in Gansu Province. From Sui to Ha, it takes about 11 or 12 days, and the passenger ticket is about 270 to 80 yuan per person. In previous years, the camel transport between Sui and Xinjiang, commonly known as half a year, can be returned within a month since the automobile was opened, and the convenience is no less than a bad thing.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is rich in products. Except for several major valuable items, the rest are large in quantity and low in value, which are raw materials that are not suitable for automobile transportation. The products transported from the interior to Xinjiang, such as domestic tea, marriage silk, and satin, are not as light in quality and expensive as foreign goods. Moreover, in the automobile itself, the required vehicles, machinery, and a large amount of gasoline all rely on foreign goods, which harms the national economy and may not be worth the loss. Therefore, if we sincerely want to develop Xinjiang's transportation, directly achieve the goal of low cost and smooth sales, and indirectly solve the major problems of immigration, reclamation, and industrial development, it is better to extend the Longhai Railway and use the wood and coal mines of Qilian and Tianshan on the spot to complete the plan of the Yilan Line. (Appendix: At present, if you want to go to Xinjiang for inspection and travel, you should first contact the representative of the province stationed in Tianjin or Nanjing for formalities. If you want to take the Xinsui bus, it is best to write to Mr. Mu, the director of the bus station in Suiyuan.)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Eastern Chahar Encroaches on Northern Chahar,劃 Northern Chahar into the Eastern Chahar Puppet Autonomous Region, and Seizes Salt Beaches in Xilin Gol League of Mongolia</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Recently, the actions of the Japanese in eastern Chahar have been very noteworthy. Since the discovery of the Japanese enticing local people to sign "petitions" and secretly surveying the terrain in the six eastern townships of Guyuan, Takahashi Tan, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, ​​stated before leaving Ping for Changchun that he would relay the telegram to stop it. As of recently, a puppet Eastern Chahar Autonomous Region Administrative Commissioner's Office has been established in Dolun. According to information from relevant parties, the puppet office has three departments: staff, guidance, and administration, each with two sections, all under the guidance of Mr. Naka-Dō Eihō, a Japanese consultant and director, to implement various plans. Areas east of the Great Wall line in eastern Chahar and Erdena Hahi and Ujumchin Banner in northern Chahar have been forcibly incorporated into the puppet autonomous region. According to another report, Li Shou-hsin, the commander of the puppet Eastern Chahar Special Zone Garrison Army, also established a headquarters in Dolun not long ago, with four divisions: staff, adjutant, military supply, and military law. The puppet army in eastern Chahar was reorganized into two detachments, a total of two cavalry regiments and one infantry regiment. Liu Jiguang was appointed as the commander of the first detachment, Yin Baoshan as the commander of the second detachment, and Li Jingzhen, Chen Sheng, Wang Zhenhua, and Ding Qichang were appointed as the commanders of the cavalry regiments, and Lu Wenguang and Jing Dequan were appointed as the commanders of the infantry regiments. These troops have recently been very active in various parts of eastern Chahar. Another regiment was formed as the guard of the puppet autonomous chief's office, with Yang Yunshan concurrently serving as the regimental commander. In summary, the future attempt of the Japanese in eastern Chahar should be no small matter. Next, Otsuka Sanjiro, the director of the puppet Chengde Salt Affairs Office, recently led a large number of salt merchants through Dolun to Lama Yingzi and Changdu River in the Xilin Gol League to investigate the Mongolian salt beaches and ordered the Mongols in each area to register at the Dolun puppet Salt Affairs Office. The intention of the Japanese can be more than half thought of. Therefore, Prince Dolji of the banner recently came to Ping day and night to pay homage to the authorities, reported the reality of the Japanese attempt to buy Mongolian salt, and requested that personnel be sent immediately to negotiate with the Japanese and stop the activities. Today (9th), Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Japanese-occupied Chahar Provincial Government, said that he has not received a detailed report on the actions of the Japanese in eastern Chahar. The provincial government has now telegraphed the Guyuan County Government to investigate and report. Song (Zheyuan), the chairman, is paying close attention to the rumors while recuperating in the hospital. Song is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital next Wednesday (i.e., the 13th), at which time he will be able to decide the date of his return to Chahar. Xiao also said that, according to common sense, the problem of eastern Chahar was completely resolved at the end of the lunar year, and there should be no more accidents in eastern Chahar recently.

<h3>Civil Construction Departments in Sichuan Province Make Efforts in Production and Construction</h3>
<p>The Construction Department Gathered Experts to Study Development Matters, and the Central Agricultural Farm Sought to Improve Agriculture in Various Counties</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Sichuan authorities have always paid great attention to production and construction. Last year, a provincial production and construction conference was held to discuss and decide on cases, which have been implemented one by one. Now that the provincial government has been established and politics have returned to normal, it will be more conducive to the development of construction undertakings. According to Guo Wenqin, the director of the Construction Department, "The construction affairs in Sichuan Province will be divided into two types: production and national defense. Those related to production, such as advocating domestic products and improving local products, are urgent tasks. This kind of construction is the textile industry as it is called in Japan. Those related to national defense, such as developing electricity and developing minerals, will be held separately, which is generally called heavy industry. The power of Guanxian has been investigated in the past, and it has a total of 70,000 to 80,000 horsepower. If it can be used properly, not only will industry be greatly assisted, but transportation can also rely on its development. Since well salt, we know that it is extremely rich, but it is a pity that it is not used properly. For example, brine contains some chemical elements. If it can be used to develop industry, there will be many benefits. However, ordinary people only know how to use it to make soybean curd, and do not know how to extend it to other uses, which makes good raw materials succumb to the land. The Construction Department has decided to conduct a survey of such undertakings first. After about four months, the survey work will be completed, and construction work will begin. Recently, the Construction Department gathered more than 40 experts to discuss this issue, and has obtained some answers. A construction design committee will be established to plan everything. The mining inspection team will also set off to various places to conduct surveys. According to general experience, Sichuan Province's oil reserves are not very rich. Whether to develop it is still to be considered. However, oil production is necessary because there is currently no suitable object in Sichuan Province to replace it in the future, so it will probably be extracted from coal." Gan Jixiong, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs and the director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Farm, in order to improve agriculture in the entire Sichuan Province, previously submitted a request to the governor's office to order the county governments in northern Sichuan to cooperate in conducting agricultural surveys. Recently, he submitted a request to the provincial government to instruct the county governments to implement it earnestly in order to improve agriculture. The provincial government ordered the counties to comply yesterday, and the original order said, "According to the presentation of Gan Xu-yong, the director of the Sichuan Central Agricultural Experiment Farm, the Ministry of Civil Affairs previously received the Sichuan Relief Governor's Office Political Order No. 14571, instructing the investigation of agriculture in various counties. In addition to the original text being exempt from recording, they immediately stepped up their work and prepared to complete it. In November of last year, they stated that the order instructed the county governments of all counties in Sichuan to order their subordinate agencies, legal entities, district and township heads, and schools at all levels to assist in agricultural surveys, and to inform the people of all counties to know about it so that the investigation could be carried out. They submitted a request to the Governor's Office for review, and then received an instruction to allow the county heads to order their subordinates to do their best to assist and announce it to the public. In December, they brought the orders of the Jiangbei and Ba counties to conduct surveys in the Jiangbei Shichuan Farm and the Xili area of ​​Ba County. However, the township heads of various counties mostly made excuses to shirk their assistance in the investigation, and their implementation was lazy, resulting in difficulties in investigating products, prices, agricultural conditions, customs, weights, and measures. They also did not clearly inform the neighbors and farmers, resulting in suspicion among the farmers, and some even mistakenly believed that they were communists. Although the investigators repeatedly explained and guided them, it was still difficult to establish trust due to unfamiliarity with people and places. I believe that agricultural investigation is the basic work for improving rural areas. The Agricultural Revitalization Committee of the Executive Yuan has achieved remarkable results in investigating agricultural conditions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces, and Chiang Kai-shek has ordered the Farmers' Bank of the four provinces to investigate Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan. The political renewal in Sichuan Province should catch up quickly. Although this matter is handled by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, it is as important as the government itself in each county. Moreover, it is being handled under orders, so how can the counties regard it as Qin and Yue? The second phase of the investigation is about to start. In addition to training investigators by the Ministry of Civil Affairs to promote and guide in various ways during the investigation, they are specially requesting the Governor's Office to strictly order the county heads to earnestly assist the investigators and handle the following matters upon arrival: A. Explain the true meaning of agricultural investigation and the responsibilities of the investigators, B. Summon village chiefs and farmers to give lectures, C. Collect the account books of merchants over the years to investigate prices, D. Summon the people who are needed for investigation, E. Contact the homes of village chiefs or other rural administrative personnel in the investigation area to serve as the residence of the investigators (three investigators live in the countryside, which is convenient for investigation, and the cost of accommodation and food will be paid), F. Assign one person to serve as a guide, G. Protect the safety of the investigators, H. Other assistance related to agricultural investigation. Although the above items are trivial, they do not disturb the people. If we want to complete the investigation mission within the deadline, we must have the assistance of the township heads. Since the township heads are mostly delaying and shirk, I am afraid that the investigation will be more difficult in the future. We have to request the Governor's Office to instruct the county governments to strictly order the district and township heads to earnestly comply with the orders and assist in the investigation when the investigators arrive. All the reasons for requesting the enforcement of the law and asking the county heads to strictly order the district and township heads under their jurisdiction to earnestly assist in the agricultural investigation, whether or not they are appropriate, are submitted for your approval. We are hereby notified that, in addition to understanding the presentation, this case has been ordered by the Sichuan Relief Governor's Office to order the county heads to forward the orders to their subordinates to do their best to assist and announce it to the public for the people of the county to know. In addition to the presentation of the various situations, we ask you to forward the orders to the county heads under your jurisdiction to earnestly comply with the orders for implementation. This order, etc., is to be printed and distributed and ordered separately, and shall be ordered to the county heads to comply with the orders and report the situation of compliance for investigation. This order is urgent,"</p>
<h3>Min Province Begins to Recruit Civil Armies</h3>
<p>Joint Office Established in Zhangzhou, Many Civil Army Units Request to be Recruited</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The recruitment of civil armies in Min Province has been agreed upon by the Pacification Director Jiang Dingwen and the Provincial Chairman Chen Yi. The Pacification Office will jointly handle the recruitment with the Provincial Government. A "Joint Office for Recruiting Civil Armies" has been established in Zhangzhou. The Pacification Office has sent Chief of Staff Tian Xiyuan, Senior Staff Officer Chen Zhida, Xu Yongxiu, and Yang Xianzhi, and the Provincial Government has sent Chief of Staff of the Security Department Yu Nianci, Staff Officer Zheng Bingru, and Hu Jiwu to co-chair the office, with Yu Nianci as the director. Yu arrived in Zhangzhou from the province on the 4th and started working on the 7th. The office is scheduled to be officially established on the 11th. It is divided into three departments: (1) General Affairs Department, (2) Verification Department, (3) Management Department, all of which are concurrently held by personnel from the Pacification Office and the Security Department. The commanders of the various pacification areas are responsible for contacting, recruiting, and concentrating the various civil army units. Then, the office will send personnel to verify them. The office will decide how to organize and disband them after the verification, and whether to give them a title. According to Yu, "The government's recruitment of civil armies this time will accommodate and recruit all the large and small units in all areas that have realized their mistakes, sincerely return, and can submit themselves to the law, face their past, and give them a bright path. Those who do not join the recruitment, or request to join but do not concentrate and wait for verification, and those who do not regret continuing to ravage the local area, the government cannot appease them, so it can only severely suppress and clear them to eliminate local hidden dangers. The purpose of this recruitment is to reorganize all the civil armies in the province and ensure that not a single gun or bullet remains in the hands of the people. Therefore, we sincerely hope that those who request to join the recruitment can bring all the guns and bullets with them for verification. As for the recruitment principle, there are no restrictions. The old, weak, and inferior guns can all be verified. The Security Department used this method to recruit civil armies before. As a result, the various security teams submitted only soil guns, which reached 10,000. Chairman Chen plans to burn them. The government has no use for this kind of guns, and leaving them in the hands of the people is extremely harmful. The organization of the recruited civil armies will follow the three-three system promulgated by the General Headquarters, with each security regiment under the jurisdiction of three battalions, and each battalion with three companies, plus a machine gun and mortar company. However, it will be determined according to the situation. As for the recruitment expenses, the Military Commission has stipulated to allocate 60,000 yuan per month, and the rest will be allocated by the provincial government. The provincial government had previously set the civil army expenses at 300,000 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 210,000 yuan, plus the military commission's subsidy, the monthly amount is 270,000 yuan. Once the recruitment work is completed, the provincial government will make unified plans. The government has two necessary conditions for the recruited civil armies: (1) Obey orders, (2) Wait for the dispatch of personnel for training. After the recruitment, the troops will not be transferred immediately. As for the reorganization of the teams after the recruitment, it will be divided into three steps: (1) The defense area is not fixed and can be transferred at any time, (2) Eliminate old and weak soldiers and inferior guns, (3) The civil armies in the entire province, regardless of boundaries, will be reorganized and merged to supplement those that are understaffed. The provincial government has completed the first two steps for the security teams compiled in this year. The third step will be implemented after all the uncompiled civil armies in the province have been compiled. The newly compiled teams will be temporarily commanded by the joint office. When the office is closed, they will be commanded by the provincial government." After the office is established, it will be open from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm every day. Various civil army units can send people directly to the office to contact and request to join the recruitment. The Anqing civil army unit led by Zhan Fangzhen has sent personnel for verification. Zhang Liutian of the Zhangzhou civil army has also sent personnel to request to join the recruitment. In addition, many small units from various places have requested to join the recruitment. Zhang Heshan of Nan'an and Ye Wenqi of Changtai have not yet contacted. In addition, Wang Zhennan of the Jinjiang civil army is now summoning his troops to request to join the recruitment, and Xu Ruilin is also summoning his troops in Zhangzhou to wait for verification.

<h3>Fellow Jiangsu Province Natives in Beijing Request Abolition of the New Property Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>Public Security Expenses Do Not Lack Room for Financial Support, No Need to Levy Property Tax Widely and Increase the People's Burden</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously resolved to unify the methods for collecting property tax in various counties, levying tax on both commercial and residential properties without distinction. Commercial properties are taxed at 15% of the rental value, and residential properties are taxed at 8% per month of the rental value. If it is self-owned, the tax is levied based on the assessed value, and progressive tax rates are used, with penalties for late payment. The regulations have been established and circulated to various counties, and have been implemented since March 1. Since the official announcement, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce and the Property Management Office have sent telegrams calling for maintaining the old practices and not making changes. Yesterday, fellow natives of various counties in Jiangsu Province in Beijing also held a meeting to discuss the matter. It was unanimously believed that the new regulations have heavy tax rates and severe penalties. At a time when the rural economy is collapsing and all industries are depressed, the people's ability to bear the burden is extremely limited. It was decided to immediately send a telegram to the Central Political Conference, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be immediately ordered to revoke the new property tax regulations in order to alleviate the people's hardships. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>"Recently, we read in the newspapers that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has announced the Regulations for Collecting Property Tax in Various Counties of Jiangsu, which will be implemented on March 1. All people in various counties of Jiangsu Province are shocked by this. First, the tax rate is too high, and the people cannot bear the burden. Article 4 of the regulations stipulates that commercial properties are taxed at 15% per month of the rental value, and residential properties are taxed at 8% per month of the rental value. Article 6 stipulates that self-owned commercial properties are taxed at 1.5 per thousand per month of the property value, and self-owned residential properties are taxed at 0.8 per thousand per month of the property value. The tax rate is so high that it is unprecedented among the current property taxes in various provinces and cities. Comparing the local counties with provinces and cities is already inappropriate. Moreover, taxing commercial and residential properties without distinction in both urban and rural areas, what crime have the people of Jiangsu committed that they should bear this undue burden alone? Second, the penalties are too harsh, and the people are endlessly disturbed. Article 21 of the regulations stipulates that if a house is rented out and the tax is not reported within one month, a penalty of five times the tax amount will be imposed. Article 22 stipulates that the property tax of each household should be paid monthly, with a penalty of 10% of the tax amount for overdue payment within ten days, 20% for overdue payment within twenty days, and 30% for overdue payment within thirty days. If the payment is still not made, the county will issue a summons to demand payment and impose a penalty of 50% of the tax amount. Such harsh penalties are truly shocking. Furthermore, in a large county with numerous commercial and residential households, the distance between the city and the countryside is often tens or hundreds of miles. The people will have to go to the county every month to pay the tax, and a slight delay will result in monthly penalties. It is known that Jiangsu Province already has a heavier burden of land tax than other provinces. Recently, a large amount of public debt has been issued again. For important constructions such as water conservancy, specific funds have already been designated. Public security expenses do not lack room for overall financial support within the existing tax revenue. Even if there is a shortage, it may as well be moderately raised from the large income items of opium dens, opium sales offices, and opium smoker licenses to offset the shortage. There is no need to levy property tax widely and increase the burden on the people of the entire province. In the prosperous county towns of Jiangsu Province, although some property tax is levied for public security expenses, the tax rate is not so high, and most counties have not yet implemented it. How can one decorate the words and unify the tax rate, saying that it is not increasing the burden? Even if one takes a step back and considers it an increase or decrease in the tax rate based on the existing property tax, it should still comply with Article 3 of the Provisional Law on Supervising Local Finances, which states that 'When provinces and municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan need to change tax items, increase or decrease tax rates, or raise public bonds, they should prepare a plan in accordance with the law by the provincial or municipal government, consult the Ministry of Finance for review and endorsement, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for review and transfer to the Legislative Yuan for discussion and decision, and submit it to the National Government for order.' Article 4 states that 'Counties and cities shall not change tax items without legal basis. When they need to increase or decrease tax rates or raise public bonds, they should prepare a plan in accordance with the law by the county or city government, and convene local legal groups for public discussion before the establishment of the county or city council, and report it to the Finance Department for review and endorsement, and submit it to the provincial government for discussion and decision, and send it to the Ministry of Finance for record.' Moreover, Article 2 of the Jiangsu Province Regulations for Collecting Property Tax clearly stipulates that the property tax in various counties of the province, whether it has been implemented or not, shall be handled in accordance with these regulations. That is, even if it has not been implemented in the past and is only now being implemented, there is no doubt that it is increasing the burden on the people. The reasons should be explained and principles should be formulated, and the competent department should be requested to review and forward it to the Executive Yuan and send it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion and approval before it can be effective. How can it be announced and implemented without going through the above procedures? (Article 22 of the regulations stipulates that these regulations shall be implemented upon the decision of the Provincial Government Committee.) Such illegal collection is truly disregarding the central government and arbitrarily imposing harsh levies. Even if the people of Jiangsu are weak, they will never recognize its effectiveness. This association cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the provincial government violate the law in this way, and cannot bear to see the people suffer this disturbance. We dare to appeal to you to examine and supervise Article 7 of the Law on Supervising Local Finances, which states that 'Local governments at all levels shall not execute any changes in tax items, increases or decreases in tax rates, or raising of public bonds without approval in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of this Law, and shall not include them in the budget,' and Article 2 of the Provincial Government Organization Law, which states that 'The provincial government may issue provincial orders and formulate provincial single regulations and rules for provincial administrative matters within the scope of not conflicting with central laws and regulations, but matters concerning restricting people's freedom and increasing people's burdens shall not be executed without the approval of the National Government.' Urgently order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to revoke and suspend the implementation of the recently announced Regulations for Collecting Property Tax in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province, in order to alleviate the people's hardships and emphasize the rule of law. Yunjian Native Association, Suzhou Native Association, Wujin Native Association, Yangshu Native Association, Wuxi Native Association, Yixing Native Association, Jiangyin Native Association, Taixian Native Association, respectfully bow."</p>
<h3>Hubei Construction Department Obeys Orders to Expedite the Repair of Liaison Highways</h3>
<p>—Determined to Complete and Open to Traffic Within the Time Limit—</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Over the past two years, the highways within Hubei Province have been repaired and opened to traffic under the leadership of the Construction Department, totaling 2,695 kilometers. However, the liaison highways with other provinces are difficult to connect due to overlapping mountains or difficulties in raising funds. Now that the bandit suppression military affairs are tense, Hubei Province is the hub of various provinces, and it is imperative to communicate the traffic of Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi. The Construction Department has recently received strict orders from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to actively start construction, and has already proceeded in accordance with the orders: (1) Regarding the Hubei-Hunan trunk line, personnel have been sent to Hunan to discuss the connection points and implement measurement work. Except for the Chongyang to Tongshan section, which is relatively easy to construct, the remaining sections from Tongshan to Pingjiang are more difficult and will require funding. (2) Regarding the Hubei-Jiangxi trunk line, most of the project has been completed. On the line directly to Nanchang, only the wooden bridge between Jiujiang has not been repaired. Once this bridge is repaired, it will be possible to reach Nanchang directly from Wuchang. (3) Regarding the Hubei-Shaanxi trunk line, the Laogoukou to Baihe section has been completed, and Hubei and Shaanxi provinces have been connected. (4) Regarding the Hubei-Sichuan trunk line, it is particularly important at present, and the project is also the most difficult. In addition to the Badong to Enshi section, which is being accelerated, the two sections from Enshi through Yichuan to Wanxian have also sent measurement teams 1245 to implement measurement in sections, and construction will begin within this month. The authorities of the Construction Department are determined to make the greatest effort to complete all of the above four major trunk lines within the time limit set by Chairman Chiang.

<h3>Lawyers' Associations in Various Provinces Endorse Shanghai Association's Proposal</h3>
<p>Main Abolish Special Criminal Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association believes that the new Criminal Code has been promulgated by the National Government, and its implementation law has also been drafted by the Legislative Yuan. The date of implementation is not far away. However, it is found that all special criminal laws currently in force, such as the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China, the Anti-Smoking Law, and the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits, should be abolished by the government's express order.

The original telegram is as follows (abbreviated title): "For your attention, the new Criminal Code was promulgated by the National Government on January 1st of this year, and its implementation law is also being drafted by the Legislative Yuan. The date of implementation is not far away. However, it is found that all special criminal laws currently in force, such as the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Against the Republic of China, the Anti-Smoking Law, and the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits, are all created to accommodate people and events, or the crimes and punishments are severe and easily framed, or the procedures are simple and difficult to reverse, infringing on the authority of ordinary courts and violating the spirit of the rule of law, which has long been criticized by people in society.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Implements Inspection of Imported Wheat Flour</h3>
<p>Prevent Adulteration with Starches and Other Substances</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has noted that the quantity of imported wheat flour in recent years has increased sharply compared to the past, which is of great importance to the future of the people's food supply.

If this powder is sold on the market, it will not only reduce the people's nutritional strength but also damage the health of the national physique. The ministry has specially formulated detailed rules for the implementation of wheat flour inspection in accordance with Articles 1 and 18 of the Commodity Inspection Law to carry out wheat flour inspection.

<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Chinese Tourism Delegation to the Philippines, organized by Shanghai's various sectors and led by Deputy Head Wang Xiaolai, departed Shanghai for the Philippines on the 19th of last month. The itinerary and sightseeing lasted two weeks. Except for Head Wang Rutang, who remains in the Philippines for further investigation, all members returned to Shanghai yesterday aboard the Changxing Company's Russian Emperor ship. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM yesterday, the Russian Empress ship entered the port and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. At 2:30 PM, a special passenger ferry dispatched by Changxing Company sailed to Qichang Wharf. Many representatives from various groups and organizations in the city went to welcome them. Except for Head Wang Rutang, who remains in the Philippines for further investigation, the remaining 26 Shanghai delegation members and two members who joined in Guangzhou, totaling 28 people, returned.</p>
<p>List of Delegation Members</p>
<p>The delegation members who returned to Shanghai yesterday include Wang Xiaolai and his wife, Pan Gongzhan and his wife, Mrs. Xu Xiaochu, Liu Yazi and his wife, Chen Songyuan and his wife, Wang Tianshen, Wang Yanqing, You Jusun, Mao Heyuan, Zhu Shaoping, Li Yingsheng, Yao Xijiu, Sun Lanting, Chen Yonglin, Chen Xiangtao, Du Jinsheng, Le Fucheng, Zheng Caizheng, Zheng Xuejun, Zhong Guoquan, and Dai Yizhong. Joining from Guangzhou were Wang Jiyuan and Bao Lengxue.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Deputy Head Wang Xiaolai, speaking to a New Voice News Agency reporter aboard the ship, the sightseeing trip to the Philippines left a very good impression. Upon arrival in Manila, Filipinos had already established a reception office for the Chinese Tourism Delegation to the Philippines, so we did not need to worry about accommodation and food. The hospitality of the Filipinos was truly appreciated. The Philippines has worked hard for its autonomy in the past eight years, and this will be evident next year. They sincerely hope we can participate in the Philippine Exposition when it is held. As for our overseas Chinese compatriots engaged in commerce and trade in the Philippines, they have not developed in recent years due to the impact of the global economic downturn. However, overseas Chinese have a very solid foundation in the Philippine market and can stand firm despite external pressures. This is a major reason. Our trip was a private undertaking and does not require reporting to the government. However, in due course, we will record our impressions and publish them in newspapers for the reference of our countrymen.</p>

<h3>Tai Shuangqiu Endorses the Native Cloth Movement in Beijing</h3>
<p>Beijing Mayor Shi Ying recently initiated a native cloth movement to encourage Beijing residents to use native cloth, cultivate frugality and the virtue of using domestic goods, and help revitalize the rural economy. On the 4th of this month, an enlarged memorial week was held at the municipal government, inviting Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng to speak about the purpose of the native cloth purchase movement. According to Tai Shuangqiu, the initiator of the 22nd Movement at Great China University, "I deeply sympathize with the native cloth movement initiated this time in Beijing, with the promotion of important Party and state figures like Wu Zhihui and others. In recent years, agricultural product prices have fallen, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the manual side occupations on which farmers rely for part of their livelihood have been eliminated by the influx of foreign goods. The suffering of farmers is deepening day by day. In view of this, we initiated the 22nd Movement in the previous year (i.e., the 22nd year), united comrades, and organized the 21st Society to promote domestic goods and implement people's livelihood education. In recent years, we have been engaged in rural relief work, vigorously promoting hand-spun and hand-woven native cloth. The proposition of the Beijing native cloth movement coincides with the purpose of the 22nd Society. I believe that the bank's lending to help the rural areas is a good policy, but the cash reserves of various banks are limited. It is heard that the total amount is only several tens of millions of yuan. Even if this is completely invested in the rural areas, each person will only get a few yuan, which is a very small amount. If native goods are promoted, especially hand-spun and hand-woven native cloth, so that 300 million farmers across the country have work to do during the five months of the agricultural slack season, even if they earn five cents of silver a day, the annual income will be tens of millions of yuan, which is better than the millions of yuan lent by the banks today. Therefore, promoting native goods, especially native cloth, is a fundamental solution to helping the rural areas. However, what is called cloth should especially pay attention to hand-spun and hand-woven cloth. Machine-made yarn is not widespread in the country, and foreign goods are flooding the market at low prices. Farmers are ignorant and happy to use them. If this is used to promote weaving native cloth, although it can help a part of the farmers on the one hand, it is actually no different from promoting foreign goods for foreign merchants on the other hand. According to the results of two years of experimental research by the 22nd Society of the Jinjiaxiang Rural People's Livelihood Experimental Zone in West Shanghai, jointly organized by the 22nd Movement Promotion Association of Great China University, one person weaving cloth requires ten people spinning yarn. The selling price of the improved cloth is not higher than the goods woven from foreign yarn on the market, and the daily wages of spinning women are about 400 cash. According to this calculation, only two pieces of cloth need to be sold per day to maintain the livelihood of 30 people with a capital of 300 yuan. It can be seen that hand-spun and hand-woven cloth is a fundamental solution to help farmers in areas where domestic and foreign cloth or yarn is scarce, and it should be vigorously promoted. However, native cloth is only one aspect of native goods. In addition to clothing, other daily necessities should also be based on native goods as a principle. Our ideal is that the current plan to help the rural areas should adopt the policy of combining work and agriculture, first improving the original handicraft production, and then adopting small-scale machine industry after the economy has developed considerably, so that rural side occupations can be developed and farmers' livelihoods can be enriched. If our government can promulgate a clear order to make the whole country use native goods, starting with the use of native cloth, then the rural industry will surely be prosperous. This is no different from the government investing tens of millions of yuan in the rural areas. Wu Zhihui also meant to promote the native goods movement as a national policy in his speech this time. I sincerely hope that you will continue to lead, and all parties in society will surely respond, and the restoration of the rural economy can be expected soon."</p>

<h3>Li Tianzhen Investigates and Reports on the Tragic Situation of the Suzhou Disaster</h3>
<p>会长 of the Red Swastika Society, Li Tianzhen, was entrusted by the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Famine Relief in Various Provinces and other charitable organizations to handle urgent relief in various disaster-stricken counties in Suzhou Province. All counties such as Liyang, Yixing, Danyang, Jiangning, and Jiangpu have been investigated and released in order. Now, due to the serious situation and excessive disaster victims investigated in Lishui, the relief supplies are limited and insufficient for distribution. A letter to the Famine Relief Association was submitted early, requesting a life for the wailing of the afflicted people. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "Respectfully, it is investigated that Lishui was historically blocked by transportation, and it was difficult for soil vehicles and mules to travel, so although it is close to the capital, only 120 miles, it is very rare for those who know it. The terrain is high and mountainous, with a population of 170,000 people, divided into five districts, with 450,000 acres of grain fields, and mountain fields accounting for three-quarters. Last year, it suffered a severe drought. Not only was there no harvest in autumn, but also miscellaneous grains such as sweet potatoes, wheat, and mung beans, which were planted several times, were withered to death, resulting in an unprecedented disaster for more than a hundred years. According to the county's habit, cultivation is early. Last spring, seedlings and crops were able to be planted everywhere. Although the weather was dry, farmers mortgaged and borrowed loans, trying their best to hope for rain to help, and they hoped to have some harvest. However, no rain was obtained in March, and a lot of manpower was exhausted. As a result, there was no harvest. It suffered two major losses, which was more tragic than uncultivated land. Tianzhen was entrusted with life to accompany the county's chief executive Zheng Shouchneg on January 23rd to lead the relief team to Liyi for investigation and release. Before starting the work, the county party department, county government, county famine relief committee, and local gentry were convened in the county party department to discuss the investigation and release methods. The investigators were divided into fifteen groups to investigate and distribute the relief tickets in the countryside. Each group was responsible for three villages, specializing in the four poor and the elderly and disabled who cannot live without relief, and then issued relief tickets. When the investigators witnessed the dying disaster victims and the tragic death of starvation, even the dogs in each village disappeared, the chickens were unheard, and there was no smoke. The families of the visible fish were everywhere. There are more than 60,000 people in this kind of disaster victim, and the total amount of relief is 13,000 yuan, excluding the 10,000 work relief from the Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Relief Association. Only 1,550 bags of rice were purchased. The investigators could not work and distributed the money to Qingceng. Tianzhen witnessed the situation and could not bear to sit idly by. Therefore, he returned to Shanghai and appealed to the conference to increase the relief money by 10,000 yuan and add 1,100 bags of rice. The total number of relief rice was 2,650 bags, which were distributed. After all, there were too many disaster victims, and the number of relief tickets was limited, and the amount could not be fully issued. Each disaster victim received only eight liters of rice, and those who were not rescued temporarily maintained their lives with Guanyin powder bran, tree bark, grass roots, and aquatic plants. Therefore, they died every day. The so-called Guanyin powder is actually a kind of weathered stone. After eating it, the large intestine is congested, and they die in pain, which is especially unbearable. The director of the supervision department, Cheng Jingsheng, and Zhu Jingchuan, two gentlemen of the supervision, came to Lishui to inspect and also considered that the disaster situation was serious and the relief money was very small, and they once called for an increase. Because the number of disaster victims died every day, and they were waiting to be fed, they had to start the urgent relief in the city in districts from February 15th to 28th without waiting for the arrival of the rice purchased later. The urgency of the situation can be imagined. More than 4,000 households came to collect rice every day, and the order was still good. During the distribution, the supervisors Gu Ziyang and Chen Kanghe were invited to Lishui to supervise the distribution. Chen Jun came in person, and Gu Jun sent his representative Cao Bingqian to participate in the distribution together because his foot disease had not healed, and took the Guanyin powder and the cakes made of tree bark that the disaster victims ate to the provincial newspaper for reporting. The 1,100 bags of rice purchased later arrived in Beijing on the 6th, and are now being transported quickly by car for the purpose of continuous distribution. This is reported.</p>
<p>The Association for Famine Relief in Various Provinces recently received a letter from Li Tianzhen, the deputy director of the inspection and release in Jiangsu Province, reporting that the early disasters suffered by various counties in Suzhou Province last year were rarely seen in the inspection and release in the past 20 years. The most serious ones were Liyang, Lishui, and Jurong, followed by Gaochun, Jintan, Yixing, Yizheng, and Luhe, and then Jiangpei, Zhenjiang, Wujin, and Jiangdu. Although the comparison was slightly different, the disaster situation was serious in all cases. The people affected by the disaster had broken stoves in their households, and people had no vitality. The ferns had been searched to exhaustion, and bran was difficult to fill. They cried out from hunger and were covered in cold, selling their children, and some families fled or even committed suicide. Among them, those who died of starvation were even more uncountable. All kinds of situations, seeing it hurts the heart, and thinking of it causes tears, which makes it really unbearable to say, and it is impossible to describe in detail with pen and ink. What is suffering is that the disaster is widespread and the money is tight. If the inspection and release are carried out according to the original number of urgent relief, it is really impossible to start. It is necessary to return to Shanghai and make a final appeal to all parties. As a result, each county received 20,000 to 30,000 yuan at most, and only a few thousand yuan at least. A drop in the bucket is still not helpful, etc. The association's affection is eager to relieve the disaster. The investigation is quite truthful, and the release is also extremely essential and practical. However, the disaster is widespread and the money is small. Although the secondary weights are deleted and the deaths are saved exclusively, it is difficult to popularize. Looking at the remnants, I want to catch no tears. Ha Nei Shan De can provide assistance in this most tragic period of the Qinghuang is not connected, and life and death people and meat white bones are in the compassionate thought. The ditches are strong, and the grieved swans are leading the way.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies Occur at Datongmen and the 16th Pier</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Zhang Tongxing jute bag shop at No. 62, Yangjiadu Heng Street, south of the 16th Pier in the South City, was opened by Zhang Changrong for many years. At about 8:30 PM the night before, three robbers dressed in short clothes and holding weapons suddenly broke into the shop, pretending to be customers. They took out pistols and warned the employees not to make any noise. One robber monitored their actions, while the other two robbers searched wildly. As a result, they robbed a gold ring, a silk cat fur robe, and a flannel robe and a blue silk robe each. At the same time, they also robbed the tenant Sheng Xuansheng's family of 30 yuan in cash, a pair of gold bracelets, three gold rings, and a silk cotton robe. After the three robbers robbed, they carried the loot and rushed out the door to the north. Also, at about 7:00 PM the night before, the home of Dong Anxiang, a Yancheng native at No. 74, Manzhu Lane, inside Datongmen, was also visited by three robbers with Jiangbei accents. Two robbers each held a pistol and pushed the door open. They robbed 11 yuan in cash, a pair of gold earrings, and two women's cheongsams, and rushed out the door to the west. Afterwards, Dong reported the robbery to the Xundaodao Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in charge to investigate the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Xieshunxiang is Robbed for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Xieshunxiang cotton cloth shop at Nos. 115 and 117 Ningxing Street (commonly known as Vegetable Market Street) opposite Baoyu Lane in the French Concession is a store run independently by Mr. Ling Junxiang from Ningbo. The business is very prosperous. In recent years, due to the impact of the sluggish market, the store has adopted a prudent policy, and the business has declined compared to before, but the appearance is still the same, which has led to the coveting of bandits. In mid-December of the last lunar year, three bandits patronized the store. As a result, they robbed more than 70 yuan in cash. The case has been reported to the police for arrest and investigation. The day before yesterday (the 10th), at 6:30 PM, five or six bandits came again. Three bandits each held guns and broke into the store, while the remaining bandits were on the lookout outside the door. Just as they were about to start searching, the store owner Ling Junxiang returned to the store from collecting debts outside and walked into the store. He was immediately caught by a bandit who spoke with a Jiangxi accent, holding his collar and holding a box gun aimed at Ling's chest, claiming that the last time he was cheaper. This time, he will never let him pass the door and quickly hand over the silver. Ling Jun saw that there were weapons and did not dare to resist. He immediately took out 30 yuan in cash from his wallet. The bandit saw that Ling Jun was wearing a diamond ring on his hand (worth more than 200 yuan) and forced him to take it off. Ling Jun also took the diamond ring and gave it to him. The robbers then searched the drawer in the account, and there were only 41 yuan in cash. The robbers put it in their pockets. Not satisfied, they saw that there were several packages of cloth in the store, so they took a package, including 12 pieces of Shirting cloth, and walked to the door, shouting loudly to hire a rickshaw, putting a package of cloth on the rickshaw, and the bandits escorted it to the west. The store employees did not dare to chase them because they saw that the bandits were all holding guns and box guns, and they let them leave freely. Afterwards, Ling Jun opened a list and reported it to the Big Bell Police Station, which immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the store to investigate. Because the bandits dared to carry out robberies twice with weapons, they were very bold and had to catch the stolen goods and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Two People Commit Suicide by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>One Dead, One Alive</p>
<p>Wang Gendi, a local girl, is 25 years old and has not yet married. She lives at No. 91, Baoyu Lane, Aiduya Road. She was criticized by her mother for something the night before. Afterwards, she was depressed. At about 0:30 AM yesterday morning, she secretly took raw opium to commit suicide. Her family found out and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. After two hours, she died.</p>
<p>Chen Zhongyi, an apprentice at Wang Shuntai woolen shop on Nanjing Road, is 18 years old and from Ningbo. For some reason, he secretly swallowed two bottles of tranquilizer pills at about 6:00 AM yesterday morning. Fortunately, his colleagues noticed it early and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which sent patrolman No. 240 to the scene and summoned ambulance No. 83 to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Carelessness at Gutiansheng Flower Garment Warehouse at the Intersection of North Chengdu Road</h3>
<p>Losses of Approximately More Than 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>There are hundreds of warehouses at the intersection of North Chengdu Road (i.e., the west side of the Great King Temple on the Suzhou River) in the Public Concession, including three-story and two-story buildings. A portion of the two-story warehouses there are the property of the British-owned Longmao Foreign Company, rented to Gutiansheng Machinery Flower Factory nearby to store flower garments. For some reason, a fire suddenly broke out at about 1:00 AM yesterday (the 9th). The workers guarding the warehouse were sleeping in another small room at the gate. Because it was late at night, the workers were all asleep, so they did not know where the fire came from. Later, the Fire Prevention Association's observation post noticed it and rushed a leather hose cart to put out the fire. However, the warehouse was full of flammable materials, and the fire was very fierce and difficult to extinguish for a while. It was not extinguished until after 8:00 AM. However, the scattered fires in various places were still being watered by the Xinzha Police Station Fire Department until yesterday evening. According to Mr. Gutiansheng, the flower garments stored in the warehouse were worth about 15,000 to 16,000 yuan, but he had fire insurance of 10,000 yuan with Shunchang Insurance Company, so the loss was only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. According to another investigation, the burned houses in the warehouse totaled 50 to 60 rooms, each estimated at 1,500 yuan, so the loss was about 90,000 yuan. Therefore, the total loss is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. The warehouse of Lihe Tobacco Leather Company there is also connected to the warehouse. Fortunately, the south wind was very strong that day, and the flames went north, avoiding the disaster. It is also fortunate.</p>

<p>Shen Xuexin, a young man from Suzhou, 18 years old this year, is an apprentice at the Huichang pawnshop at the intersection of Haige Road and Taishidelang Road in the French Concession. At 1:45 PM on the 9th, during a free time in the pawnshop, Shen went out to ride a bicycle, practicing riding north and south on Taishidelang Road. Just as he was riding from south to north, when he reached the roadside in front of No. 211 on that road, a moving truck No. 17060 (British Concession license number) F1437 (French Concession license number) driven by car driver Wang Abao (No. 37, Ningbo native, living at No. 874, Peng Road) of the Gongda Moving Yard at No. 422, North Henan Road, was transporting a funeral to Hongqiao Town. The driver was careless when driving past No. 211, Taishidelang Road, and the fender on the right side of the truck touched Shen's bicycle, knocking him and the bicycle down. Shen's right leg and abdomen were scratched by the truck wheels. The patrolman found out and immediately took the car driver who caused the accident along with the truck to the Beidang Road French Police Station for investigation. The injured person was sent to Guangci Hospital, but he died of serious injuries before he could be treated. The body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy, pending a report to the Special First Court today to send someone to examine it. Shen's family is still in their hometown, and someone has been sent by Huichang Dang to urge them to come to Shanghai today to take care of the funeral and other matters.</p>

<h3>### Ruan Lingyu's Funeral Today – All Sectors Mourn the Artist – A Major Loss to Film Art</h3>
<p>A Glimmering Bronze Coffin, Eternal Slumber in a Desolate Room – The Reverent Gaze of Ten Thousand, Social Grief is Palpable</p>
<p>Following the suicide of movie star Ruan Lingyu, newspapers reported the event, and countless people mourned her death. Since the afternoon before yesterday, people, undeterred by the long journey, went to pay their respects, truly turning the streets into a throng. Such honor and mourning could only be achieved because Ruan's performances on screen deeply moved people during her lifetime. The influence of film art and its practitioners on society is evident here. Alas, Ruan Lingyu is gone. How should those now engaged in film work cherish their art, their own personality, and their lives to guide the masses toward a normal life? Now, we compile news from various sources regarding Ruan Lingyu's suicide as follows:</p>
<p>Ten Thousand People Paying Respects</p>
<p>Since the news of Ruan's suicide was announced, society was in an uproar. On the day before yesterday, thousands of people went to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road to pay their respects. Yesterday, from dawn to noon, the desolate and quiet Jiaozhou Road became a scene of shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. The responsible police station specially dispatched officers to maintain order in front of the parlor. Although a guestbook was prepared in front of the hall, it was impossible for everyone to sign. However, from 11:00 AM until evening, the funeral committee took turns counting the number of visitors, which reached 17,000. According to the person in charge, no fewer than 60,000 people have come to pay their respects in the past two days. It is expected that there will be four more hours of public viewing of the remains today, and the total will reach over 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Fragrant Flowers</p>
<p>Ruan's body has been moved from Room No. 1 upstairs to the west end of the hall downstairs, with her head facing west and her feet facing east. The surroundings and the center of the hall are filled with flower baskets sent by relatives and friends, emitting a rich fragrance, turning the room into a spring scene. A new-style dressing table is placed in the vestibule, with various cosmetics on top, seemingly prepared by the parlor staff for Ruan's occasional makeup. Those paying their respects walk past the body in an orderly fashion, in silence and without commotion. At the east end of the hall, a large food table is set up, where Tang's relatives are present, taking care of arrangements and hosting guests, which are handled by the staff of the Lianhua Film Company. Elegies and eulogies have not been hung. A white cloth banner is placed in front of the hall door, with the words "Such a Life," a subtle reference to Ruan's famous film "Life" produced by Nanjing's Lizi Monthly.</p>
<p>Gleaming Bronze Coffin</p>
<p>Ruan's body will be placed in the coffin at 3:00 PM today. It is a specially prepared bronze coffin from the parlor, gleaming with a silver-white color, priced at 1,750 taels. The burial will be scheduled soon. This stands in contrast to the case of Ms. Ai Xia, who committed suicide by taking poison last spring. Her coffin cost only 40 or 50 yuan, and her remains are still kept in a certain association hall next to Xietu Road. Perhaps Ruan can be slightly comforted in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Funeral Program</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency found a copy of the "Ruan Lingyu Funeral Ceremony" program. Here is a transcription: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Viewing of the remains (Public). 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, Memorial Service in front of the coffin (Limited to relatives, friends, Lianhua colleagues, and representatives from all sectors): (1) All take their seats, (2) Chairman delivers the eulogy, (3) Report on Ms. Lingyu's life and the circumstances of her death, (4) Colleague representative speaks, (5) Guest representative speaks, (6) Family members give thanks (each limited to five minutes), (7) All stand at attention, (8) Three bows, (9) Family returns the bow, (10) Moment of silence, (11) End of ceremony. 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, Encoffining. 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM, Family tribute, Lianhua colleagues' public tribute: (1) All stand at attention, (2) Presiding officiant presents flowers, (3) Reading of the eulogy, (4) Three bows, (5) Family returns the bow, (6) Moment of silence, (7) End of ceremony.

<p>Telegrams of Condolence Arrive</p>
<p>After Ruan Lingyu's death, all parties expressed their regret and sent telegrams of condolence, numbering dozens each day. Here are a few excerpts: (1) The China Educational Film Association telegram states, "To Lianhua Film Company on Shanghai and Hong Kong Road, we were shocked to hear the news of Ms. Ruan Lingyu's passing. At a time when domestic films are developing upward, a superstar has suddenly fallen, deeply regrettable. The arts are just budding, and it is not easy to cultivate artists. Trouble-makers take advantage of opportunities, not knowing how to cherish, but instead destroying, which is even more regrettable. We hope that you will comfort the departed, protect those who are coming, and strive for the future of Chinese films with utmost anticipation." (2) Guo Youshou, member of the Central Film Enterprise Guidance Committee, telegram states, "To Lianhua Film Company on Shanghai and Hong Kong Road, and to the family of Ruan Lingyu, we were shocked to hear the news of Ms. Ruan Lingyu's passing. We did not expect that she, who usually played tragic roles, would actually fall into tragedy herself. Now, considering who among film stars surpasses her, the sorrow is indescribable." (3) Dai Ce, member of the Central Film Inspection Committee, telegram states, "To Mr. Luo Mingyou of Lianhua, Ruan Lingyu was a film star admired by the masses. Her sudden misfortune is a major loss to our country's film art. The sad news arrived, and we cannot bear the pain. We send this telegram to express our condolences."</p>
<h3>### Municipal Party Department Sends Investigation – Situation of Rice and Grain in This City</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Request Increased Tax on Xian Rice, Municipal Federation Appeals for Rejection</p>
<p>The Special Municipal Party Department of this city recently received a report from the 16th Sub-branch of the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, stating, in brief, that Shanghai has a vast area and a dense population. Usually, rice is transported from the mainland, but most of it is imported foreign Xian rice. There are high-grade and low-grade types of foreign Xian rice. Now that rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood, it is difficult for ordinary people to obtain even a single grain. Shanghai rice merchants are requesting increased taxes on low-grade goods because high-grade goods are not selling well, in order to monopolize and hoard, disregarding the livelihoods of ordinary people, and requesting that it be rejected. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Department considered that the amount of foreign rice imported in recent years has been alarming. It is essential to investigate whether domestic rice is indeed lacking, the quantity of foreign rice currently available, and whether the continued import of foreign rice would harm rural areas. As for the rice merchants' request to increase taxes on low-grade foreign rice, it has a major impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, yesterday, Yu Yaoqiu, an investigator from the Investigation Section, was dispatched to the rice industry in the north and south of the city and the Municipal Agricultural Association to conduct a detailed investigation from all relevant parties. The investigation results will be submitted for review and then brought up for discussion at a meeting.</p>
<h3>### Two-Roads Administration Bids for Construction – Ten-Story Building</h3>

<p>City Railway Starts Construction Today</p>
<p>After the Two-Roads Administration tendered for the earthwork and wooden bridge engineering of the city's short-rail railway branch line, by the end of last month, four bids were received for earthwork engineering and six for bridge engineering. The bids were opened on the 8th. As a result, Changji Construction Factory won the bid for the earthwork engineering, with a cost of 0.228 yuan per three cubic meters, with a completion deadline of 50 days. Cailinji Construction Factory won the bridge engineering bid, with a total price of 4,484 yuan, with a completion deadline of 35 days. The above two projects are scheduled to begin construction today.</p>
<p>Ten-Story Building to be Put out for Tender</p>
<p>As for the ten-story building planned by the Administration, the corner of Baoshan Road and Jielu has been identified as the site. Architect Dong Dayou has prepared a construction plan, which has been approved by the Ministry of Railways. The building is ten stories high, 150 feet long, and 60 feet deep. The exterior walls will be made of artificial stone, and the lower part will be made of sesame stone. The interior will be divided into eight departments: the Police Department, the General Affairs Department, the Materials Department, the Affairs Department, the Mechanical Department, the Accounting Department, and the Works Department.

<h3>### Reactionary Criminal Submits to Court – Presenting National Affairs in Person</h3>
<p>The Presentation is Impractical and Not a Major Plan – The Goal is to Transfer to the Rehabilitation Center</p>
<p>A certain Zhang Guangzhen was previously detained by the police authorities and sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for propagating reactionary ideas. He was sentenced to five years in prison and sent to prison. It has been three years since then. Now, Zhang has submitted a petition to the Procuratorate of the Second Branch of the High Court, claiming that he has major national affairs that urgently need to be presented in person. Therefore, Chief Prosecutor Zheng Yue opened a court yesterday to discuss Zhang's proposal. Lawyer Qian Xunjiu from the Municipal Council also attended the court. According to Zhang, he had heard that political prisoners could request to be transferred to a rehabilitation center after serving more than half of their sentence. Now that he has served more than half of his sentence, he is requesting to be transferred to the rehabilitation center. Prosecutor Zheng asked what the so-called major national affairs were, but Zhang's presentation was all impractical and empty talk. Upon examination, the reason was simply to hope to be transferred to the rehabilitation center. Prosecutor Zheng instructed Zhang to return to detention pending review.</p>
<h3>### Business Circles on Various Roads in the French Concession – Protest Illegal Searches</h3>
<p>Shops on Baille Road, Min Tiniyin Road, Ximen Road, Route de la Fayette, Caishi Road, Galère Road, Pingzili Road, and other roads in the French Concession, regarding the case of citizen Dong Wenli, who was falsely accused by the French police of opening a gambling den, have not been resolved for twenty days. Therefore, they unanimously submitted a joint petition to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession yesterday, requesting further protests. Here is a transcript of the original text: On the evening of February 12th of this year, at about 8:00 PM, a large number of detectives from the French police station searched Wang Shunxing Wood Shop at No. 206 Pingzili Road without reason, committed acts of violence and forced confessions, and illegally detained merchants, attempting to frame Dong Wenli. Negotiations have been ongoing for six weeks, but no solution has been reached, causing public anxiety and unrest. After the incident, our shops and others witnessed the situation and were indignant. They all believed that the police searched shops without any basis and illegally searched them. Regardless of whether there was a basis for this case, after the search, there was no evidence of any illegality. They even used violence against apprentices, instigated forced confessions, and arbitrarily detained merchants. Afterwards, they attempted to frame Dong Wenli, implement searches, and monitor actions. Their illegal actions were particularly blatant, disturbing residents and hindering commerce. There is no greater example of this. If we do not actively negotiate, thoroughly investigate, and strictly handle the case, and provide adequate guarantees for peaceful residence and work, then the merchants and residents of the concession will inevitably feel insecure. We are concerned about this and are submitting this to your association, requesting further protests. At the same time, we also request that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be informed to seriously negotiate with the French authorities, so that the police must apply to the court for a search warrant before searching residents, in order to show seriousness and avoid abuses. We are awaiting your urgent instructions.</p>
<h3>### For a Single Beef Bun – A Serious Homicide Case</h3>
<p>Shop Assistant Slaps Apprentice – Butcher Knifes Yang Kunsheng to Death</p>
<p>Yang Kunsheng, a Zhenjiang native who runs a box business at No. 12 Jinyu Lane on Min Tiniyin Road in the French Concession, is 37 years old. His wife, Xu, is 27 years old. At around 7:00 PM last night, Yang ordered his apprentice, Sun Wenqing (16 years old, from Qingjiang), to buy three beef buns from the Yumeiju Muslim Restaurant at the corner of Pishao Nait Road, Nos. 59-61. Unexpectedly, one of the buns fell to the ground. The apprentice Sun wanted to exchange it, and an argument broke out with the shop assistant. As a result, the shop assistant slapped Sun twice. Sun was not willing to be outdone, so he picked up a piece of meat skin outside the door and threw it into the shop, then turned around and fled, crying to the mistress Xu. Xu then told her husband. Yang was furious and immediately rushed to Yumeiju to reason with the shop assistant. Unexpectedly, the shop owner, Shi Yushan (47 years old, from Baoding), had just returned from outside. The two sides disagreed and clashed. Shi, in a moment of desperation, took a bull-ear pointed knife from the counter and stabbed Yang several times in the back, waist, and arms. Yang died on the spot. There were many passersby at the time who saw the catastrophe and immediately reported it to the nearby patrol. The police arrested Shi, seized the sharp knife, and took him to the police station. The police chief ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the scene, and notified the Fuyuan Sub-station to send mortuary workers to carry the body to the morgue, and report to the Second Special District Court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>### Tragedy in the Lotus Pond of Zhaofeng Park</h3>
<p>American Child Fell into Water While Helping English Child – Both Were Rescued, But the English Child Died</p>
<p>Shortly after noon on Saturday (the 9th), a six-year-old English child in Zhaofeng Park lost his footing and fell into the lotus pond. At that time, a seven-year-old American child grabbed a tree near the water to try to save him. Unexpectedly, his hand slipped and he also fell into the water. The pond was five feet deep. The child could not save his companion, and he himself was in danger of drowning. He shouted for help and was heard by a Chinese guard in the park, who rushed to the scene. He saw the hats of the two children floating on the surface of the water and knew that something bad had happened. He quickly jumped into the water and grabbed the American child first. However, the child was quite heavy, and the bank was steep, so he could not bring the child ashore. He also shouted for help. Another Chinese guard heard the cry and rushed over to help him rescue the American child. Then, he rescued the English child who had fallen into the water first. At that time, both children were unconscious. They performed artificial respiration, and the American child soon woke up, but the English child was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but unfortunately passed away.</p>

<h3>### Huacheng Creates Improved Canned Paint Varnish</h3>
<p>Canned food has become very popular recently because it is convenient to carry, so it is welcomed by travelers. However, the inside of the can often rusts due to salty and acidic substances, which is unsanitary. The inside of imported canned food cans is coated with sanitary oil, which can prevent rust and last a long time. The domestic canned food and can-making industries are paying close attention to this. Recently, it was learned that Mr. Shi, a technician at the Huacheng Printing Iron and Can Factory on Nanchengdu Road in this port, has researched and developed three types of sanitary oil welding, tin paint, and heat-resistant varnish. The sanitary oil is used to brush the inside of the can to prevent rust, the welding tin can avoid the use of strong water and maintain a clean surface, and the outside of the can is usually pasted with printed paper. If heat-resistant varnish is used for printing, it will not change color even after boiling. The factory's test results are very good and is rushing to produce the products. It plans to distribute them to various sectors and apply for testing by the sanitary authorities.</p>

<h3>### This City's 24th Year – Cholera Prevention Plan</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, considering that there is a large population in this city, and it is difficult to achieve effective results in preventing cholera without a whole plan, has recently formulated specific measures and decided to implement them starting May 15th. The plan is as follows: (1) Injecting preventative vaccine. The goal is to inject 1 million doses this year. A. Schools: Staff will be dispatched to all municipal and private schools to implement the plan, and it must be completed before the summer vacation. B. Factories: Factories in the city with more than 30 employees will be notified in advance by the Social Affairs Bureau to accept injections, and the labor union will be consulted to assist in persuasion to facilitate the process. C. Groups: Groups in the city with more than 30 people, such as charitable organizations, prisons, guard posts, and other legal groups, will be injected by staff dispatched by the bureau on a scheduled date. D. Residents: Staff dispatched by the bureau will cooperate with the Public Security Bureau to persuade residents and shops to get injections from house to house. E. Shantytowns: The residences in shantytowns are filthy, and the bureau will dispatch staff to cooperate with the police to order all residents to get injections to ensure compliance. F. Rural areas: The bureau will assign one or two epidemic prevention officers to each area, depending on the size of the area and the population, to cooperate with local municipal commissioners or police officers to persuade residents to get injections. G. Boat People: Boat people on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek are at risk of bringing epidemics from abroad. The bureau will dispatch staff to cooperate with the water patrol team to persuade them to get injections. H. General Injections: In accordance with last year's methods, staff will be dispatched to busy and convenient urban areas to set up stalls and cooperate with police officers to persuade passersby to get injections. (2) Propaganda: Instilling common sense of hygiene, so that citizens know how to maintain their health, is also an essential part of epidemic prevention. This year's methods, such as posting announcements, distributing colored leaflets, and conducting film lectures, will all be carried out so that every household knows about it. (3) Disinfection: Dirty water contains many germs. Once drunk, it can spread cholera. Disinfection work must be carried out to prevent epidemics. (4) Investigation of Cases and Testing of Stool: This year's implementation method is to dispatch staff to investigate and collect stool samples from patients after receiving reports of cholera cases and submit them to the testing institute for examination to determine the diagnosis and determine the treatment method. (5) Personnel: In addition to the original personnel, an additional temporary doctor, a technician, and ten injectors will be added. (6) Implementation Date: From May 15th to September 15th of this year. If the facts require it, it will be extended appropriately.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yanxiang Discusses Hubei's Construction Progress</h3>
<p>Zhang Yanxiang, a technical expert from the Hubei Construction Department, came to Shanghai yesterday on business. A reporter visited him at his lodging to inquire about the recent construction situation in the province. He provided a detailed account, which is recorded as follows: In the past two years, Hubei Province's construction has largely focused on transportation, namely highways, long-distance telephone lines, and inland river shipping. Highways: The Hubei sections of the Jingchuan trunk line (Beijing-Sichuan), the Bianyue trunk line (Kaifeng-Guangdong), and the Logui trunk line (Luoyang-Guilin) have now been completed. Therefore, it is now possible to travel directly from Hankou to Baihe in Shaanxi and Jingfu in Henan, and from Shashi to Nanyang in Henan and Changde in Hunan. Furthermore, it is possible to reach Shashi from Hankou in one day and Yichang in one and a half days, and Yangxin from Wuchang in one day. All highways in the province are managed by the Construction Department, with a total of 197 long-distance buses. More than half of these were newly acquired within the past two years, and business is booming, with monthly income of about 100,000 yuan. However, due to rising gasoline prices, profits are limited. Long-distance telephone lines are mostly erected along highways, with 3,000 kilometers of lines already in place and over 50 locations for calls. Relay amplifiers are currently being installed to improve communication. Inland river shipping is all managed on behalf of commercial vessels, totaling over 80 ships. Last year, a dividend of 1.6% was paid for the first half of the year and 3.1% for the second half, which can be considered the first successful step in government control. The total investment in highway roadbeds, bridges, and culverts across the province is approximately 5.5 million yuan, and vehicles cost approximately 300,000 yuan. The section from Badong to Shinan is currently under construction, with a budget of over 1 million yuan, as construction is very difficult in the mountainous region. The investment in long-distance telephone lines is approximately 900,000 yuan, but business is poor, with monthly income of only over 3,000 yuan, insufficient to cover expenses. However, it is of great value for military and political purposes. For inland river shipping, shallow-draft vessels need to be added to expand routes and reach Laohekou directly throughout the year. Laohekou is the gateway to Hanzhong and produces abundant products. However, because the Han River is shallow and dry in winter and has rapid currents in summer, ordinary ships cannot navigate it. It is planned to build five shallow-draft tugboats to operate on a regular schedule, so that the local products of northern Hubei and southern Shaanxi can be exported as much as possible. Hubei's industry had a foundation, but unfortunately, the official cloth, silk, hemp, and four bureaus established by Zhang Wenxiang, as well as the Hanyang Iron Works, paper mill, needle factory, glass factory, woolen mill, etc., have all been closed down early. It is now impossible to restore the old appearance. Only one bureau remains, leased and operated by the Minsheng Company. There are also five privately-run yarn mills, one of which has not resumed operation since it stopped work in the summer of 1933. However, Shenxin No. 4 Factory rebuilt its machinery after the fire two years ago and is now fully operational, making it the most modern yarn mill in Wuhan. This is the only encouraging point. Hubei's cotton production used to be the highest in the country, but since the major floods of 1931, production has decreased to less than a fraction of its former level. Last year, it had already fallen to second place in the country, and it is urgently necessary to find ways to provide relief. Therefore, the cotton yarn industry is listed as the main focus of Hubei Province's production and construction this year. In the Xiangyang and Fancheng area, cotton fields are being promoted, varieties are being improved, and the Furong water hybrid is being used. Ginning and packaging plants are being established to concentrate and control production. The ginning plants use new American-style saw ginning machines to improve quality and reduce costs. Hubei's iron ore reserves used to be the richest in the country. After the Hanyeping Ironworks stopped production, iron sand was directly transported to Japan, and iron smelting furnaces across the country also ceased operation one after another. By May of last year, the only remaining iron plant, the Liuhegou Iron Plant in Chenjiaji, Hankou, had also stopped production due to various influences. Now there is not a single iron smelting furnace in the country, which has a great impact on national defense industries. Therefore, the Construction Department is planning methods to assist in its recovery. Other construction projects in Hubei Province, such as group farms and model irrigation, are also underway, but due to limited funding, it is unwilling to undertake a hundred factories at the same time, and can only concentrate all its efforts on the above-mentioned items. Director Li Fanyi has been working diligently for the past two years, avoiding empty talk, so the outside world rarely knows the recent situation. Zhang Yuejun pays close attention to all construction items, urging and promoting them with all his efforts. Bandit areas in the province have gradually recovered, and barren fields are now mostly sown with spring wheat. Winter defense last year was passed peacefully. There are absolutely no bandit incidents or robberies in places where boats and vehicles can reach, which is actually more peaceful than Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Hankou's commerce last year was not affected by Shanghai's recession, but rather showed a trend of prosperity. Wuchang's police are clean, tidy, and orderly, and there are absolutely no cases of kidnapping, robbery, or murder. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also praised this in the expanded memorial week. Other social pathologies, such as adultery, theft, and extortion, are rarely heard of. Wuchang is now the location of the military headquarters, and municipal engineering will be vigorously promoted, using Nanchang as a model, to build a new Wuchang. The Wuhan Iron Bridge is the hub connecting the Pinghan and Yuehan trunk lines. The provincial government has agreed to cooperate with the Ministry of Railways to complete it. It is still in the planning stage, and the project is several times larger than the Qiantang River Iron Bridge. There are more than 1.5 million residents in Wuhan, with 50,000 to 60,000 people crossing the river daily. Therefore, the Wuhan ferry service is extremely developed. The steel-hulled ferry recently ordered from the Hexing Factory in Shanghai has been launched and will soon be completed and shipped to Hubei. Wuchang's East Lake and Luojia Mountain have beautiful scenery comparable to Hangzhou's West Lake. The provincial government has now established the East Lake Construction Committee to do its best to develop it into a scenic and cultural area, which is also one of the advantages of the new Wuchang. In short, Hubei Province is the heartland of China, and Wuchang is the area of the first uprising. People across the country should do their best to assist its construction.</p>

The society received a letter from Zhang yesterday, saying that on the way, on the ship "Lapu Daha," a British educator named Benli, introduced by an engineer named Zeng Huasheng, requested to see the works. Zhang agreed. Benli was amazed by Chinese art at first sight and discussed it with the shipowner. The shipowner invited guests in the first-class lounge of the ship to publicly exhibit the works and formally invited all the guests on the ship to visit the exhibition, which received very good praise. Benli also introduced many artists from his country to visit, and they were all amazed, considering it a rare masterpiece. Zhang also arranged with Lin, the manager of the Singapore Daily, and our country's envoy to Singapore, Diao, to prepare for the exhibition in Singapore on the 27th of last month. They were responsible for finding a venue, and all the works will soon be publicly exhibited in that city.</p>
<h3>New-Style Small Packard Cars Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The new-style small Packard cars, number 120, will be displayed at the Madie Motor Company model room at 80 Edward Road within days. Since the announcement was made, it has aroused considerable interest among people in Shanghai. Shortly after the release of photos and previews of this type of car, news about the cheaper price of Packard cars spread everywhere. Cablegrams from automobile companies and distributors from various countries to the New York Packard Motor Company office inquiring about details and placing orders came in one after another. After a small notice was published in the local newspaper in Buenos Aires, Argentina, South America, more than 100 customers went to the model room on the same day to ask for photos and inquire about prices and detailed features. Similar situations also occurred elsewhere. As for letters urging delivery, they were flying in like snowflakes. Dozens of customers in the United States had already signed orders. There were also many people who placed orders without ever seeing a photo of the car, which shows the faith of Americans in Packard cars. This long-established car does not need a test drive, so it is expected that after the test drive car arrives in port, the orders for cars will pile up like a mountain.</p>

<h3>In the Bright Spring Light, the Hongqiao Sanatorium Has a Noticeable Healing Effect</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in western Shanghai is a well-equipped sanatorium with the latest architecture in our country. The natural scenery is beautiful, the sunlight is sufficient, and the air is fresh. In this bright spring light, the sanatorium has a more significant healing effect on patients. In addition, the Chinese and Western diets are exquisitely flavored and suitable for the patients' bodies, which is especially praised by the patients' families. The sanatorium's X-ray machine is the world's latest invention of high-pressure safety shockproof machine, which is personally diagnosed by Dr. Susi Hai, a German medical doctor and X-ray expert. The sunroom was donated by President Sun Zhesheng and can be used in cloudy weather, accommodating 16 people at a time for irradiation, which is more effective than natural sunlight. In addition, the facilities of the library, lounge, and restaurant are all sufficient to entertain the body and mind of patients. The specialized doctors in charge of medical affairs are all full of service spirit. Some weak patients have gained as much as 30 pounds after treatment in the sanatorium.

<h3>Hunan Refugees Disturb Wusong</h3>
<p>In the evening before yesterday, more than 200 Hunanese refugees, men, women, old and young, suddenly arrived in Wusong. Supporting the old and carrying the young, they went to stay in a large temple two miles outside the south gate of Baoshan. The refugees were quite strong and unreasonable. After arriving, they took the opportunity to cook dinner, formed a team, and asked nearby villages for firewood, rice, vegetables, and other items. If they were not satisfied, they would take them away, causing panic among the villagers. The platoon leader of the security corps, Sun Weijin, learned of this and, fearing an accident, immediately reported to Regiment Commander Tang and led the corps members and platoon leader Sun to suppress the situation. On the one hand, they persuaded the refugees to gather in the temple and not to sneak into the villages to demand items. Until dawn yesterday morning, Regiment Commander Tang, Platoon Leader Sun, and others escorted the refugees out of Wusong.</p>

<h3>Chen Xiaodie and Others Found Kangle Pharmaceutical Factory to Manufacture and Sell Kangle Egg Yolk Essence</h3>
<p>Since Dr. Ma Wenzhao invented egg yolk essence for smoking cessation, its principle of smoking cessation has been published in this newspaper recently by Dr. Tang Jiazhen. The general public is well aware that the original substance of egg yolk essence is nothing more than three types: (1) extracted from animal brain matter; (2) extracted from fresh egg yolks; (3) extracted from soybeans. Among the three, the one extracted from egg yolks has the greatest effect. Dr. Ma's successful experiments used this substance. The one extracted from soybeans often has adverse side effects, and after taking it, there are often adverse symptoms such as fullness in the abdomen, decreased appetite, and constipation. Moreover, this substance comes from Germany as a byproduct of soybean flour and cannot be refined. Although it was once sold on the market, doctors who have discussed it have temporarily stopped using it. If egg yolk essence is ordered directly from abroad, the price will be too high (30 eggs are required to make 10 grams), and in the future, the rights and interests will overflow, which will inevitably be a huge trade deficit. Mr. Chen Xiaodie, in view of this, has been completely successful after four months of long-term research with Dr. Tang Jiazhen, etc. He can extract and refine 10 grams of egg yolk essence from 20 eggs, which is very effective. Compared with the effective ingredients contained in soybeans, it increases by 60%. In addition to sending the finished product to Dr. Ma for identification, a factory will be set up to manufacture it and named Kangle Egg Yolk Essence to meet the urgent needs of society. It is currently being produced day and night, and it is expected to be available in early April.</p>

The results are as follows: (1) In order to implement Article 3 of the charter, which states the responsibilities of Category B, the 15 committee members were divided into three groups on the spot to be responsible for investigation, with one group taking charge each month in rotation. (2) Twelve kinds of fast-selling goods were first proposed, and prices were assessed on the spot, which shall not be different in the future. (3) The association will issue certificates to the investigation committee members for identification and to show seriousness. (4) Each committee member will first begin to investigate the names and addresses of fellow traders who have not joined the association, so that they can be collected at the next meeting and distributed to the industry regulations for compliance.</p>

<h3>Medical Circle</h3>
<p>Dr. Li's Invention of Special Medicine for Lung Abscess In Western medicine, the treatment of lung abscess is mostly treated by surgery, so it is often dangerous, and there are many who cannot be saved. Dr. Li Weiguang studied in Japan and obtained a doctorate degree. After returning to China, he devoted himself to the study of ancient Chinese medicine treatment methods, in order to complete a new medical art combining Chinese and Western medicine. After ten years of research, he finally developed a new special medicine. Pneumonia and intractable lung abscess, if treated with this medicine, can avoid the trouble of surgery. It is a great contribution to the Chinese medical field. This medicine may be manufactured and sold in Shanghai. Dr. Li used to practice medicine in Taiwan. He was persuaded by a friend to come to Shanghai and opened the Yuying Pediatrics Hospital in the Taihe Building, Lloyd Road. He used his specialty in pediatrics to perform his wonderful skills. It is said that Dr. Li is still continuing to study various new treatment methods, and several new medicines have also reached the realm of completion and will soon be available. Recently, the son of Mr. Wu Zhaoji in Ren'an Lane, Fuyou Road, was only three months old and suffered from pneumonia that led to meningitis. During the two weeks, he searched all the medical clinics in Shanghai and was almost in despair. Later, he was introduced to Dr. Li for treatment and was cured within a week. People far and near praised his divine skills.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read in the newspaper that the relief fund that I brought to Shanghai was due to the lack of travel expenses for the overseas Chinese, who could not go to Qiaole Village for cultivation, which is very anxious. And the non-party overseas Chinese, who get 2.5 yuan of relief per person, have been improperly handled. The 37th batch of refugees going to Qiaole Village must go through registration procedures and wait for the approval and permission of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It will take half a month if not a month. Among them, there are overseas Chinese who have been away from the country for many years, and because it is difficult to find a guarantor, they are not entitled to enter the village. Therefore, after receiving the relief from the Central Party Headquarters, they may return to their hometowns first to wait for approval. Once the order is approved, they will gather in Shanghai again and wait for free tickets to Ancheng in northern Anhui. The relief fund for non-party members was agreed upon by Hu Xifeng and others to allocate 1.5 yuan to buy half-price boat tickets to return to their hometowns. The above facts, I beg your newspaper to forward them to the Letters to the Editor column, in order to correct the audience. Sincerely, Xu Jizhuang, March 10th.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>

<p>The most unfair thing in the world is that university students cannot find a job after graduation, while those with no education hold multiple positions.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, being a loafer is said to be a profession. They also go to the "office" every morning. The so-called "office" is a pseudonym for "teahouse."</p>
<p>Watching movies is entertainment, but some people often shed tears in the cinema. Spending money to buy tears, don't you think it's silly?</p>
<p>Seeing modern women applying powder and rouge on the bus, I feel that women are really adorable toys!</p>

<h3>A Record of the Stone Carvings in Nanxiang</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Nanxiang is the leading town in our county (Jiading). There is "Yunxiang Temple" (now commonly known as the Great Temple), built during the Tianjian period of the Liang Dynasty. Initially, scholars dug the ground and found a stone path ten feet long, where two cranes often flew and gathered. The monk Deqi built a temple on the site. During the Kaicheng period of the Tang Dynasty, the monk Xingqi stopped his tin staff, and two cranes relied on him again. Mo Shaoqing donated funds to expand it. During the Qianfu period, he built two stone pillars of the Dharani Sutra of the Victorious Banner (still standing today). Later, the cranes left and did not return. After a long time, a poem was suddenly found on the stone: "White cranes fly south and do not return, only leaving true traces on the mossy base. It is a pity that later generations of empty princes, constantly practice cultivation and enjoy the two times." During the Shaoding period of the Song Dynasty, the emperor bestowed the plaque "White Cranes Flying South," written by Prime Minister Zheng Qingzhi. During the twenty-eighth year of the Yuan Dynasty, the monk Liang Xiang rebuilt it. During the Zhengtong period of the Ming Dynasty, the governor Zhou Chen repaired it. At the beginning of the Wanli period, Ren Liangyou from She County repaired it. In the tenth year of Chongzhen, the monk Hai Zheng and the monk Huimo of the Qing Shunzhi period rebuilt it. Governor Zhou exempted the base grain. In the thirty-ninth year of Kangxi, he was given a calligraphy treasure and renamed it "Yunxiang Temple." This is the origin of the current name "Great Temple."</p>
<p>There are eight scenic spots in the temple, called "Sutra Pillar Stone," "Liang Dynasty Well," "Nine-Rank Guanyin," "Cloud-Resting Pavilion," "Zhenming Juniper," "Bowang Raft," "Qi Master Crane," and "Crane Track Stone." After several vicissitudes, they are almost completely ruined. Only in the center of the lotus pond of "Nine-Rank Guanyin," there was a "stone pagoda," more than two zhang high, with extremely exquisite Buddha statues carved on the side, and it was clearly in the water, and no one dared to cross over and climb it. However, this "stone pagoda" is not known when it was built. Examining the Nanxiang Town Chronicle, it is also not recorded. Recently, I learned that the layman Yao Mengyun (Ming Hui), with a view to this, fearing the collapse of the stone pagoda and the obliteration of the historical sites, hired workers to repair it without the temple monk Lianyun. He recently discovered many "stone carvings," including a line that reads "Built in the fifteenth year of Jiading in the Great Song Dynasty," and a record of "Rebuilt in the Wuxu year of Wanli." The layman was overjoyed as if he had found a broken treasure. Now he has rubbed this "stone carving" with the Buddha statues and the writings of famous people since the Song Dynasty into a volume, and he has also obtained this "stone pagoda," whose name is "Putong," built by "Gan Zijing."</p>
<p>Counting from the "fifteenth year of Jiading," it has been 712 years to this day. "Wuxu year of Wanli" has been 376 years to this day. Our county was established in the tenth year of Jiading in the Song Dynasty, so the construction of this "stone pagoda" was only five years later. The difference is that neither the county chronicle nor the town chronicle has any record. Even Qian Zhuting (Daxin), who was famous for his epigraphy, inevitably overlooked it in the county. Therefore, I am happy about the layman's discovery and write it down as above.</p>
<h3>Sauce Garden</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Of the seven things to open the door, four of them—oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar—require the consultation of the sauce garden. Even "rice" is sold in some sauce gardens, so the sauce garden has become a place that people cannot avoid visiting.</p>
<p>Calling a sauce garden a "garden" is to emphasize the vastness of its space. It is said that it is not easy to be called a "garden." A true sauce garden must have branches in all directions. The more branches there are, the larger the garden, so it is not surprising that a sauce garden has a capital of two to three million yuan. Even if the boss of such a large sauce garden does not intend to expand, its "residential property" can be worth as much as forty to fifty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>There is also a strange thing. Although the business of all industries is sluggish, with everyone offering large discounts, sauce gardens still turn a blind eye. If there are any discounts, it is only a few small sauce gardens trying to absorb cash. As for large sauce gardens, sometimes even depositors who want to deposit cash are waved away by the "Ah Da," saying, "We don't need any money!" "Do a thousand things, do ten thousand things, but don't lose money." This is the case for all industries. However, large sauce gardens are different. When the branches hold "stocktaking," even if they lose money, the head office will definitely make money. The reason is very simple. The more the branches in the four directions lose money, the more the brand name will be deeply imprinted in people's minds, and the career of the head office will be like climbing a hundred-foot pole, advancing a thousand miles a day.</p>
<p>There are many "Ah Da" in a sauce garden. In addition to the "General Ah Da," there are "Accounting Ah Da," "Purchasing Ah Da," etc. It is said that the salary of the "General Ah Da" is only about two hundred thousand per year, but he can turn around freely and even open a small sauce garden.</p>
<p>Opening a sauce garden requires a large capital. For example, if you can do ten thousand worth of business, you need thirty thousand worth of capital.</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between Italy and Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Why do you want to invade me?</p>
<h3>Worshipping Turtles in Chaotian Palace</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The two words "turtle" were originally a term of abuse in China, so if someone is called a turtle, they will definitely be furious, because the so-called turtle refers to a surrogate for a wife who cheats on her husband. Pimping and turtles are linked, so why wouldn't people be furious?</p>
<p>However, things in China are often incredible. I don't want to be a turtle myself, but I am willing to form a dry relationship with a turtle, making my children little turtles. The fact is this: There is a Chaotian Palace on Jianye Road in the capital city. There are two large stone turtles in the palace, said to be a male and a female, a pair of turtle couples born together. Probably because they have been around for hundreds of years, people look upon them with high regard and willingly give their sons to them as god-sons and their daughters to them as god-daughters. However, the procedures for forming a dry relationship are very simple. You only need a set of incense and candles and a red string to kowtow three times in front of the turtle, then tie the red string around the turtle's body, untie it for a moment, and then wrap it around the child's neck. This dry relationship ceremony is considered complete!</p>
<p>During the old lunar New Year, Chaotian Palace is crowded with the dry relatives of the turtles, and the turtles' god-sons and god-daughters. If the turtles have spirits, they would be proud enough! As for why they don't form dry relationships with dogs or pigs, but insist on forming dry relationships with the turtle that is despised by everyone, this is of course their intention, because there is a Chinese saying that calls it "turtle longevity of a thousand years," so they believe in their hearts that turtles are long-lived. Now that their children have become little turtles, of course they can also have longevity!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Tang Tu Boldly Reveals Wealth Before a Young Woman, Selecting Colors and Desiring to Peek Through the Hearth, Illness Damages Integrity.</p>
<p>Jia Duocai stood far away, leaning his body and looking towards Yueying, moving one foot on the ground, saying: This may be true. But why is she so talkative tonight? Yueying still sat facing the corner of the table, and said in a low voice: There's no way to do it, what else could I say? When she spoke, she was stammering, holding the armrest of the chair with one hand, and stretching out two fingers with the other hand, drawing randomly on the edge of the table. Jia Duocai assessed her shy attitude, and still, she seemed lovable, so he said to Hu: If you two ladies feel that today is too soon, then tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is fine too. Tomorrow, wash and fix her up at home, and she'll look like a bride. It would be even better if you could quickly make two clothes for her to change. If you two ladies are really willing, I can give you some money first to take care of your family affairs. Zhu Hu said: Oh! That would be really good, what else can we say? Child, do you think this is good? Your aunt is counting on us to bring back money. Can we walk in the door empty-handed? As soon as she mentioned her aunt, Yueying felt a headache. Every day after opening her eyes in the pit, she couldn't speak until she closed her eyes in the pit. Now that her mother and daughter have come out and gone back for so long with no news, she won't let it go. Now that Jia Duocai is willing to give some money to take back, no matter what, it will first get a burst of joy from her aunt. (153)</p>
<h3>Royal Fragrance Drifting Records</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I remember when we left Beijing to go to Fengtian, the last time we came to the Summer Palace, we still hadn't seen any magnificent spring scenery. Because at that time, the late winter had just ended, and most of the flowers and trees had not yet sprouted, so what we saw were only newly grown green leaves and some buds. Now, only fourteen days have passed, but the capable nature has created an amazing miracle! The entire Summer Palace is decorated with flowers and greenery everywhere, like a world of brocade. All kinds of brightly colored flowers are blooming as if they are competing for beauty.</p>
<p>Peonies, this is the kind of flowers and plants that the Empress Dowager loved the most in her life, so there are a lot of them planted in this garden, it can be said that they are everywhere. When the spring breeze blows, those big flowers sway up and down, as if they are nodding to the Empress Dowager, expressing their welcome. Most of the eunuchs who did not accompany the Empress to Fengtian were assigned by Li Lianying to take care of everything in the garden. When they saw the old Buddha returning surrounded by us, they were very happy and came up to kowtow, with a few happy expressions on their faces. Below Longevity Hill, surrounded by many courtyards, is Jianming Lake. The lake water is as clear as a mirror, lying quietly in the sunlight, emitting silver-like light. From time to time, there are many small fish in the lake, jumping out of the water very lively, and occasionally jumping two or three inches above the water, but always falling down immediately, because of their uncertain activity, the water surface can be seen with circles of ripples, expanding like spirals from small to large.</p>
<p>When the Empress Dowager arrived in this realm, she immediately felt much brighter. (264)</p>

<h3>A Collection of Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>Advertising Technique… One day, a friend said to me: I encountered something today, it's really absurd. I asked him, what is it? He said: I walked past the entrance of the ×× company, and the goods displayed in the display window were really dazzling. There were two very eye-catching things, namely "anti-epidemic masks" and "sanitary menstrual belts," but they were hung together. There was no distinction between horizontal and vertical, and no difference between top and bottom. Isn't this a great absurdity? I said: This is exactly the humorous style, and it is also a type of "advertising technique."</p>
<p>Lukewarm Water and Half-Cooked Rice… There are several Suzhou people among my neighbors. As a result, two men were given nicknames by several Suzhou women. One is called Lukewarm Water, and the other is called Half-Cooked Rice. Later, when they got used to being called that, they would also happily respond. Lukewarm Water, because his temper is a bit weird. Even if you scold him or laugh at him, he doesn't get angry. Half-Cooked Rice, his temper is more difficult to handle. It means that he is half-cooked and difficult to swallow. The two of them together are quite a sight to see. One is half-cooked, and the other is neither cold nor hot.</p>
<p>Little Ghost Pinching Nose… The painter Yuan Tianxiang likes to drink and eat garlic, and he is very humorous. One evening, he had a drink with a friend, and he was chewing garlic. The friend found the smell unbearable and pinched his nose. A few days later, this friend asked him to paint a fan. Later, after the fan was painted, the friend took a look. It depicted Zhong Jinshi holding a clove of garlic in one hand, chewing it hard. A little ghost was next to him, pinching his nose.</p>
<p>Enjoying It… Maids like to talk about the good and bad of their masters. Once, I heard the neighbor's maid say this: Our grandma is young, but she is really strict. When the young master goes out, she always limits the time he must come back. If he is late, she will punish him to kneel in front of her. We servants can't persuade her. Do you think she is fierce or not? I told this story to a friend. He said: Fearing one's wife has its own kind of fun. Others hear it and think it's unbearable. He is a submissive man, bowing down to the pomegranate skirt, but it is precisely "enjoying it."</p>
<p>Meningitis… A friend, Mr. ×, is also a doctor himself. One night, he drank too much in the northern city and hired a rickshaw to go back. But he didn't specify the address. Halfway through, he suddenly fell asleep. The rickshaw puller called out but he didn't respond, so he pulled him to the police post. The policeman asked the rickshaw puller a few questions, and seeing that his face was not red, he suspected that he had a sudden illness, so he ordered the rickshaw puller to pull him to a hospital. The doctor said it was "meningitis" and gave him an injection. In the middle of the night, he woke up. Seeing himself in the hospital, he was very surprised. The nurse explained to him: You have "meningitis," it's very dangerous. He stomped his feet and said: Why would I have meningitis? I was temporarily drunk from alcohol. As a result, he paid six yuan in medical expenses before he ran out.

The above 15 people were officially selected by the organizing committee. A total of 74 people completed the entire race and reached the finish line.</p>
<p>Competition Situation</p>
<p>Starting Order Issued Under Pingyin Bridge</p>
<p>Yesterday was sunny and breezy. At 9:20 AM, the runners lined up and started east of Pingyin Bridge in front of Fudan University on Xiangyin Road. 102 people signed up to participate. Yesterday, only 94 people who were registered lined up and started. After Jia Xiangqing gave the starting order, the runners began to move forward on Xiangyin Road.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengling Takes the Lead</p>
<p>More than 180 swift runners surged forward. Police motorcycles led the way, and the Girl Scouts of the Southeast and Liangjiang maintained order along the route. From Xiangyin Road, the route turned into Huangxing Road, and then from Huangxing Road, it turned north to Kongjiang Road. The distance was already 4,000 meters. At this time, a leading general, Wang Zhengling, was in the lead. Five people followed closely behind, namely Zhang Liang, Xu Yanbo, He Baoshan, Wan Jinsheng, and Ma Yueji. Another five people, Wu Zhaokang, Gu Huiyuan, Zhou Ruquan, Ji Sheng, and Pan Ronggen, formed a long, snaking line.</p>
<p>He Baoshan Shows His Potential</p>
<p>From Kongjiang Road, the runners went to Mayushan Road. Villagers and townspeople gathered to watch. After passing in front of Guanyintang and the Yinxiang Port racecourse, the route turned into Jungong Road in Yangshupu. The Huangpu River was in sight. At this time, the champion He Baoshan jumped out and began to show his potential. Zhang Liang followed closely behind. Wang Zhengling had dropped to fifth place. Xu Yanbo was third, and Wan Jinsheng was fourth. Wang was 400 meters behind Wan. Ma Yueji remained behind Wang. Four-tenths of the journey had been completed, totaling about 8,000 meters.</p>
<p>The Two Heroes of Yunzaobang Race Side by Side</p>
<p>Jungong Road was lined with large trees, creating a beautiful landscape. The route then went north on Puxi Road to Yunzaobang, the site of the fierce battle of January 28th years prior. Zhang Liang and He Baoshan were sometimes ahead and sometimes behind, racing side by side. The situation was extremely tense. On this flat avenue, Wang Zhengling, who had fallen behind, sped up and caught up, surpassing Xu Yanbo and Wan Jinsheng. However, he was still 400 meters behind He and Zhang. Ma Yueji remained in sixth place.</p>
<p>Leaping Ahead at the Water and Electricity Plant</p>
<p>After passing Yunzaobang, the runners reached the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. Six-tenths of the journey was complete, and 13,000 meters had been covered. At a sharp turn onto Zhayin Road, He Baoshan took the opportunity to accelerate and leap ahead. Zhang Liang eventually fell behind, remaining in a pursuit position. The two were about 50 meters apart. Because his physical strength had been exhausted, the outcome was decided. Although Wang Zhengling was in third place, he was 300 meters behind. Under these circumstances, the runners reached the finish line in front of the city hall.</p>
<p>Final Difference of Thirty Seconds</p>
<p>Zhang Liang chased from behind, but it was too late. He Baoshan was the first to break the white line, winning the championship. Zhang Liang finished 80 meters behind, coming in second. The difference in their times was only 31 and 3/5 seconds. Wang Zhengling finished third, another 100 meters behind, with a time difference of about 40 seconds. Wan Jinsheng was fourth, another 400 meters behind. Xu Yanbo never arrived, and it is likely that he dropped out.</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony</p>
<p>The awards ceremony was then held in front of the city hall. Mayor Wu, Yang Jialin representing the city party headquarters, Ma Chonggan, the director of the organizing committee, Jiang Jianbai, Shao Rugan, the chief referee Shen Siliang, all staff members, and contestants attended. After Chairman Wu performed the ceremony, Jiang Jianbai reported that a total of 101 people had registered for this competition, including 51 from the business community, 16 from the industrial sector, 15 from the academic community, 12 from the military, and 7 others. The mayor and the representative of the city party headquarters then delivered speeches.</p>
<p>The Mayor's Address</p>
<p>He briefly stated that today is the day of the third long-distance running competition in Shanghai. However, a 20,000-meter race is still a first in this city. This achievement is very gratifying. The purpose of public sports is to develop public physical fitness and improve public health. China has 400 million people, a vast land, and abundant resources, but today it has become one of the weak countries in the world. The reason for this is that most people cannot develop their abilities and fulfill their national responsibilities. The reasons for this are nothing more than two: (1) poor physical fitness; (2) insufficient knowledge. Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram to the whole country, asking all citizens to be able to work and serve the society, and should choose a sport according to their nature, practice physical education, and improve their health as a basis for serving society, so that they can develop their abilities and fulfill their national responsibilities. Only then can we take advantage of China's superior environment and transform poverty and weakness into wealth and strength. Therefore, the public must promote physical education and improve their health in order to work for national survival.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association Group B Second Division: Guanghua Retains Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated Tu Jin by a large margin, 52 to 3</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association had a total of five games last night. Except for the Southeast vs. Jiang Jiang game, which was a women's game, the rest were men's Group B games. Guanghua Affiliated High School met Tu Jin. In the last game, Guanghua, with its abundance of talent, greatly defeated Tu Jin by a huge score, maintaining its six-game winning streak and winning the Group B Second Division championship. Since Guanghua Affiliated High School joined the Shanghai Basketball Association in the first year, this is the third year. It first won the championship in Group B Sixth Division, then won the championship in Group B Fourth Division. Now it is dominating the top spot in Group B Second Division, rising two levels every year, and has won three championships in a row. Moreover, in these three years, it has never lost a single time, maintaining its undefeated reputation. It is truly commendable. Yesterday, when it met Tu Jin, if all of Tu Jin's players had been able to arrive, the game would have been spectacular. Unexpectedly, most of the star players were absent, resulting in a one-sided situation. In the first half, Guanghua took the lead with a score of 22 to 2. In the second half, Tu Jin only scored one valuable point on a free throw. The game statistics are listed below.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Women's Basketball Association: Southeast Wins Against Jiang Jiang in Group B</h3>
<p>24 to 10</p>
<p>The Southeast and Jiang Jiang teams faced off at the Shanghai Garden last night for the Shanghai Women's Basketball Group B game. Since Southeast entered the competition, it has defeated every opponent, gradually creating an unparalleled winning streak. Jiang Jiang only focused on defense when facing them, lacking offensive ability, resulting in a loss of points in every quarter. Only in the third quarter did they manage to offer resistance. As a result, Southeast won with a score of 24 to 10.</p>

<h3>Youyou Cup Basketball Game Yesterday</h3>
<p>In last night's Youyou Cup basketball game, Youjia defeated Leyu. The first half was extremely tense, with Youjia leading 18 to 17. In the second half, Leyu lacked endurance, which determined the outcome. The Quanhei and Dahua teams followed closely, with their scores fluctuating. Until the last three minutes, Quanhei relied on long shots to score eight points in a row, defeating Dahua Xinxing. This year's talent is well-distributed, and they have a good chance of finishing in the top three. Yesterday's results were as follows:</p>
<p>Youjia defeated Leyu 52-28</p>
<p>Quanhei defeated Dahua 48-40</p>
<p>Xinxing defeated Shengde 45-30</p>

<h3>China Football Association: Weihua B Wins the Ball Group Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated Shanghai Textile Again Yesterday by One Goal to Zero</p>
<p>Weihua B has been in the top spot in the Ball Group with a record of seven wins, six wins, and one draw. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, they played against the Shanghai Textile team at the Sincere Stadium. The Shanghai Textile team has been improving its skills daily during the semi-final week. Since defeating Taiping 3-1, its momentum has become even stronger. However, Weihua forward Zhang Jinhai had to attend the Donghua B team, so he was unable to divide his time. Inside defender Xing Ruiting was absent due to an event, so the team's strength was greatly diminished. In the first half, Shanghai Textile launched a large-scale attack, and Weihua's territory was in constant danger. Eventually, the defense was successful, and the danger was averted. After 35 minutes of struggle, neither side gained anything. After the change of time, the teams changed sides and fought again. Weihua's forward gradually became more prominent. Back and forth, the situation became more tense. In the last two minutes, Weihua left forward Tan Guofang received a pass from Wu Jialu and scored with a bang, opening the score. Before anything else happened, the referee Shi Chongyu blew the whistle to end the game. Weihua won 1-0.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervises Research on School Issues in Various Regions (3)</h3>
<p>Proposal to Revise the Middle School Mathematics Curriculum Standards</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Ministry of Education on the results of the 23rd year middle school entrance examination, mathematics was the worst subject. In the summer of the 23rd year, the statistics of the results of the high school entrance examination in Beiping City also showed that mathematics was the worst. According to general experience, mathematics is also poor in the entrance examinations of national universities over the years. Mathematics is one of the main courses in middle schools. The phenomenon is like this, and the seriousness of the problem is known. If we do not quickly remedy the situation, we will not only waste the time and energy of most young people in middle schools in vain, but also go against the purpose of the state to educate talents and improve the level of mathematics.</p>
<p>According to the current middle school mathematics curriculum standards, which were promulgated by the Ministry of Education in November of the 21st year, the schedule of learning is as shown in the following two tables:</p>
<p>Junior High School Mathematics Schedule Time Distribution Table</p>
<p>Semester School First School Year Second School Year Third School Year</p>
<p>Course Number Period First Semester Second Semester First Semester Second Semester First Semester Second Semester</p>
<p>Arithmetic (with simple algebra) 4 4</p>
<p>Algebra 3 3 2 2</p>
<p>Geometry (with numerical trigonometry) 2 (Experimental Geometry) 2 3 3</p>
<p>Senior High School Mathematics Schedule Time Distribution Table</p>
<p>Semester School First School Year Second School Year Third School Year</p>
<p>Course Number Period First Semester Second Semester First Semester Second Semester First Semester Second Semester</p>
<p>Algebra 3 3 2</p>
<p>Geometry 3 2</p>
<p>Trigonometry 1 2</p>
<p>Outline of Analytical Geometry 2 2</p>
<p>Observing the implementation of the above curriculum standards, there are several points that should be given special attention:</p>
<p>1. According to the first table, all junior high school students are required to study arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and other subjects. If we pay attention to teaching methods and carefully select the content of teaching materials, this junior high school mathematics curriculum seems to be sufficient to enable students to understand the basic concepts of images and quantities, establish the foundation of ordinary mathematics education, and inspire their ambition to explore upwards.</p>
<p>2. According to the second table, since senior high schools do not have separate departments now, all senior high school students, regardless of their individual interests or the needs of their future careers or further education, must all study the same courses such as advanced algebra, solid geometry, trigonometry, and an outline of analytical geometry.</p>
<p>3. Since senior high school mathematics courses are ordinary compulsory subjects, if teachers cater to a small number of students with better levels in teaching, it will inevitably cause most students to become accompanying readers and gain little benefit. If teaching is based on most intermediate students, it will inevitably lead to a reduction in the level of mathematics teaching achievements. In this way, the current curriculum standards are insufficient to improve the level of middle school mathematics, and the result may be the opposite.</p>
<p>4. Nowadays, the science departments of various universities often feel that students' mathematical foundation cultivated in middle schools is insufficient or the level is too poor. To adapt to this need, the first thing is to pay attention to the individual interests of senior high school students in mathematics, enrich the senior high school mathematics curriculum and improve mathematics teaching methods. However, since the current senior high school mathematics curriculum is generally studied by all students, it is difficult to take into account individual interests in teaching. Most students attend classes in the same class, and the goal is only to pass the exam. The content of the mathematics curriculum is naturally difficult to enrich and improve, and how can we cultivate a good foundation for mathematics for students entering universities?</p>
<p>5. Senior high school students have different abilities to learn mathematics, and their needs for employment and further education are also different. Now, forcing them to learn the same advanced mathematics curriculum not only makes it difficult to equalize the level of learning, but also is impractical, wastes energy in vain, reduces general learning efficiency, and even causes students who are close to literature and art and find mathematics difficult to be accidentally eliminated, unable to develop their strengths so that they can continue to study in depth and become useful talents for society.</p>
<p>6. The curriculum of ordinary senior high schools is designed for the majority of students who will go on to higher education, but in reality, most senior high school graduates in our country cannot generally enter universities for further study. Even if most of them can enter universities, they cannot generally specialize in science. The current senior high school mathematics curriculum is not practical for young people who do not go to higher education. For those who go to higher education, they feel that the level is insufficient for science and that there is no practical need for other departments. According to the above observations, for the sake of cherishing the time of young people in middle schools and increasing learning efficiency, for enriching the content of middle school mathematics courses, and for adapting to the needs of university science departments, the implementation of the current middle school mathematics curriculum standards should be quickly remedied. The colleagues' limited views are about a few points. We respectfully offer them as reference.</p>
<p>7. Senior high school mathematics courses are taught in groups: According to the individual interests and academic needs of students, those who are willing to enter university science departments and those who like mathematics are in Group A, and those who are willing to enter university arts departments or are unable to go to higher education are in Group B. The mathematics courses studied by the group should enrich the content of teaching materials according to the current senior high school mathematics curriculum standards, strictly promote them, in order to improve the level of middle school mathematics and meet the needs of university science departments. The mathematics courses studied by Group B should appropriately change the content of teaching materials and reduce the amount, and strive to be practical and in line with the interests and needs of scholars. (According to French ordinary middle school mathematics, the mathematics is taught in groups.) Since senior high school mathematics is taught in groups according to interests and needs, its effectiveness will inevitably increase, and the level of mathematics can be effectively and substantially improved.</p>
<p>8. Stipulate the minimum standard for the current senior high school mathematics curriculum. In addition to those who are willing to enter university science and engineering departments, other famous students can choose to study mathematics courses outside the standard. (According to the new curriculum standard of the Republic of China in the 12th year, the compulsory mathematics for the first group of senior high school general courses is only 6 credits, and the compulsory mathematics for the second group is 18 credits.) Each senior high school can add courses in advanced practical mathematics, "to provide the necessary mathematical knowledge for the study of various disciplines, to enrich students' ability to examine natural and social phenomena", and to supplement the foundation of ordinary mathematics education cultivated in junior high schools and inspire students' ambition to study upwards. According to the above regulations, senior high school students who are willing to enter university science and engineering departments can study mathematics in depth, and senior high school scholars who like mathematics can also discuss and study the amount of mathematics. Teaching achievements will inevitably increase, and other students can also save time to cultivate a good foundation in other specialized subjects to meet the needs of further education or further study.

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Education Convenes a Meeting of Principals of Provincial Experimental Primary Schools</h3>
<p>Discussing the Problem of Mandarin Editing</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education convened a meeting yesterday at the Zhongshi Experimental Primary School on Shangwen Road, gathering principals of provincial experimental primary schools for boys and girls from Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai. Over twenty people attended, including Fei Xiyin, Wei Zhicheng, Shi Renfu, Cao Maotang, Wu Zengjie, Jiang Pinzhen, Sheng Langxi, etc., to discuss the issue of Mandarin editing. After the meeting, they visited the newly built school buildings of Shangzhong, and a dinner party was held at the school in the evening, where Mr. Chen Heqin, head of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession, was invited to give a lecture on the state of elementary education in various countries.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Literature Society is Established</h3>
<p>Wang Xinming and Zhou Yuying Serve as Vice Presidents</p>
<p>The Chinese Literature Society, organized two months ago by writers Wang Xinming, Zhang Yiping, Zhou Yuying, and others, held its inaugural meeting on the afternoon of the 1st in the auditorium of Binhai Middle School at 596 Qipu Road in this city. Over sixty people attended. Xu Yangfan, the standing committee member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory process. Wang Xinming was publicly elected as the chairman of the meeting and delivered an inaugural address, stating briefly: Since the May Fourth Movement, our literature has undergone a complete transformation in the past decade, with rapid progress and changes unprecedented in decades. However, many works have presented a divergence of views due to the differences in writers' beliefs, causing many obstacles in the path of regular literary development. Although the writers' tendencies are gradually converging, there are still few so-called "regular" works whose ultimate goal is the revival of this ancient Chinese nation. However, these are urgently needed… The establishment of the Chinese Literature Society is to meet the above-mentioned needs, and undoubtedly, the mission of our Chinese Literature Society is to lay the foundation for the new literature mentioned above. After passing the constitution, Wang Xinming was elected as the president, with Zhou Yuying as the vice president, and Xu Yangfan as the general secretary. Zhang Yiping, Xu Xingchu, Xu Zehai, Jiang Xiaoguang, Shen Zonglin, Chen Kui, Dai Pengtian, Wan Yiwen, Wang Ganyi, Xie Xuesun, Zhang Zongliu, Zhou Wanglou and other seventeen people were elected as directors; Zong Dian, Zhang Zongzhi and other five people were elected as alternate directors. It was decided that the location of the society would be inside 596 Qipu Road, and it was also decided to publish the "Literature Monthly" and other important matters.</p>

<h3>Wushan Deaf School Establishes the Chinese Deaf and Mute Painting Society</h3>
<p>The Wushan Deaf and Mute School in Chenghuangshan, Hangzhou City, has been established for almost four years (the principal and teachers are all deaf and mute, deeply understanding the psychology of the same illness). The daily management and education are earnest. After being registered and subsidized by the Zhejiang Department of Education and the municipal government, the number of students has increased sharply. In order to improve and expand various departments, the school has recently been carrying out large-scale construction, adding classrooms, dining rooms, dormitories, libraries, and other school buildings, all newly decorated. The principal, Gong Baorong, is skilled in calligraphy and painting. In order to promote Chinese traditional art and assist the cultural movement for the deaf and mute, he founded the Chinese Deaf and Mute Painting Society. The opening ceremony of the society was held yesterday. Twenty-one students from Shanghai and nine students from Hangzhou attended, along with 151 students from the school. The school and the painting society still have some vacancies, and students can enroll at any time. Poor deaf and mute children are provided with books by the school and enjoy free preferential treatment.</p>

<h3>Hygiene of the Skin and Prevention of Skin Diseases (2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>We know that to prevent skin diseases, we must not only pay attention to the local hygiene of the skin but also pay attention to the relationship of the internal organs of the whole body. Among them, the relationship with the digestive system is even more important. If the digestive system is not healthy and problems occur, skin diseases can occur. For example, the mucous membrane of the digestive tract, that is, when the stomach and intestines are inflamed, the food stagnating in the intestinal tract will decay and produce toxins, which will be absorbed into the blood, causing urticaria and toxic erythema. In medicine, this is called "autogenous poisoning." This is often encountered. Secondly, there is the relationship of food. Some foods, such as mushrooms, shellfish, and preserved goods, etc., can directly cause skin diseases after eating. There is also a kind called peculiar constitution. That is, patients and ordinary people have peculiar characteristics. For example, after eating a certain food, skin diseases occur immediately, but this is not the case for others. This is called peculiar constitution. The above are all directly related to the digestive system. In addition, whether bowel movements are smooth also has a significant impact on the harmony of the stomach and intestines. That is, people with habitual constipation due to food stagnation often develop skin diseases. Therefore, people with constipation should choose appropriate foods to make bowel movements smooth every day, such as eating beans and radishes. Sometimes use appropriate and mild laxatives to remove the accumulated stool. Harmful substances stagnating in the intestinal tract can be removed. The function of the stomach and intestines is adjusted, and digestion is smooth, so that the occurrence of skin diseases can be avoided.</p>
<p>The relationship between breastfed infants and food needs more attention. There is a kind called "excessive nutrition." That is, when infants are breastfed with human milk or milk powder, they often fall into excessive nutrition due to taking in milk containing a lot of fat. As a result, skin rashes occur, especially in infants with an exudative constitution. The skin rashes they develop are more vigorous and spread to the head and face. Even after the breastfeeding period, it continues to occur. If infants with such skin rashes are given rice soup or porridge, sometimes it will subside on its own. Therefore, the importance of the relationship between food and skin diseases can be understood. What we are talking about now is that excessive nutrition can cause skin diseases, but undernutrition can also be related to skin diseases, such as adenopathic diseases, which are often caused by malnutrition.</p>
<p>Now　　　　　　. Briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>Fatty　　. Attention should be paid to the skin　　. However, the amount of fat intake by ordinary people in our country is small and not as much as that of Europeans. However, several itchy skin diseases, such as eczema,　　rashes, and acne, etc., are all related to fat. Therefore, fatty foods should be restricted. Because fatty foods are not easy to digest, they stagnate in the stomach and intestines, causing stomach disorders and constipation, so they have a bad effect on skin diseases. Secondly, salty goods are also related to skin diseases, just like fat. People in our country eat more pickled foods, but we study the occurrence and treatment of skin diseases and know that restricting salt intake is really important. If salt intake can be restricted, it often has good results for skin diseases. The currently popular salt-free and salt-deficient diet therapy means this. Completely remove salt from daily food or only have a small amount of salt and take other substitutes to treat diseases. Using such therapy can cure extremely stubborn and malignant skin tuberculosis. It also has considerable good results for other diseases.</p>
<p>According to animal feeding experiments, it is known that when acidic foods are given, the sensitivity to skin inflammation irritation is strong. When "alkali-rich foods" are given, its sensitivity is weakened. The so-called strong skin sensitivity means that the skin is prone to skin diseases. The same is true for our daily food. Therefore, foods that are too acidic, such as meat, chicken eggs, and cheese, should be prohibited for skin diseases. Conversely, milk, various vegetables, potatoes, fruits, etc., are less sensitive to skin inflammatory irritation and can be taken without hindering. In short, most inflammatory skin diseases can be induced or aggravated by giving large amounts of salt, which has been recognized by scholars in various countries today.</p>
<p>Secondly, alcoholic beverages not only directly damage the stomach and intestines, but also greatly harm skin diseases because they can dilate blood vessels and cause congestion, especially for itchy skin diseases, which should be strictly prohibited. In addition, alcohol is a direct cause of rosacea, seborrhea, etc. Avoiding alcohol is the fundamental requirement. Tea and strong coffee stimulate hypersensitive nerves and should also be prohibited for itchy skin diseases. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Question and Answer on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(54) Beriberi (2) (Question) What are the general symptoms of beriberi? (Answer) The onset is very slow. You feel heaviness, fatigue, abnormal sensations, and numbness in the lower limbs, and laxity of the knee joints. In addition, there are palpitations and rapid breathing.</p>
<h3>Science and Medicine in Pingliang, Gansu</h3>
<p>— Li Kangnian</p>
<p>"Develop the Northwest!" "Develop the Northwest!" This slogan has become quite a popular catchphrase among officials in the court and ordinary people in the field in recent years. Indeed, the development of transportation and other undertakings in the Northwest has made rapid progress. In terms of medicine and health, the government is also actively working hard, but it is difficult to make it universal for a while, and the effectiveness is still very small.</p>
<p>Pingliang is the leading county among the dozens of counties in eastern Gansu, and also one of the best counties in Gansu Province. It is considered a densely populated and commercially prosperous place; however, scientific medicine in this place is shrouded in a murky atmosphere.</p>
<p>Speaking of the number of hospitals in this area, it is not small. In addition to the Catholic Church and the Christian Church each setting up a hospital here, there are seven large and small hospitals that diagnose diseases and sell medicines, and two pharmacies that specialize in selling medicines and hygiene equipment; moreover, the facades of each hospital are decorated beautifully, all with glass windows and gilded signboards, and many words such as "606," "914," and "Guonengkelin" for injections are also written.</p>
<p>However, if you stop and take a closer look, you will find ridiculous awkwardness. Believe me, it is not unjust to say that it is a murky atmosphere. A hospital hangs the name of the doctor at the entrance, and the title "Modern Medical Scholar" is even added above the name. We can imagine that a doctor with such a good title must have extraordinary medical skills, but I don't know who gave him this title?</p>
<p>Driven by the desire for knowledge, the author conducted several detailed investigations before realizing that except for the doctors in the two church hospitals, none of the doctors in the other hospitals were from formal medical schools! Among them, two were from the nursing school of Xi'an ×× Hospital, some were military doctors left over from the former National Army, and some were transferred from other places.</p>
<p>They lack the theory of medicine, but have some experience. The general people's concept of "Chinese medicine is good at internal medicine, Western medicine is good at surgery" is created by them; because their medical skills rely only on a little experience, it is very difficult to diagnose and treat ordinary skin diseases and minor surgery, so how can they accurately diagnose difficult internal medicine diseases?</p>
<p>Speaking of their business, it is very slow. On the one hand, they cannot gain the trust of the people, and on the other hand, the price of medicines is too expensive; ordinary poor people are not qualified to inquire. The two church hospitals are exceptions. On average, there are about 20 outpatients every day (internal medicine accounts for less than a quarter). It is said that although there are hospitalized patients and wards, they are not accepted for the time being because the problem of food is difficult to deal with. This is because they are charitable in nature, and on the one hand, they rely on the power of foreigners. The hygiene equipment transported from Shanghai to Shaanxi's Jingchuan and Gansu's Jingchuan can be exempted from heavy landing taxes. Therefore, the fees are lower than ordinary hospitals. On the other hand, it is also because their equipment is more complete and their technology is better. (End)</p>
<p>Postscript: Now that the call for developing the Northwest is very high, there are certainly many people who care about the Northwest; medicine and health are important tasks. For this reason, the author does not dare to remain silent, and simply reports the facts as above for those who care to use as reference material.</p>
<p>February 27, 1935, in Pingliang, Gansu.</p>

<p>Fullness in the pit of the stomach, lack of appetite, constipation, edema in front of the tibia, and pain in the calf muscles. In the early stage, tendon reflexes are hyperactive, but gradually decrease later. These early symptoms only last for a few weeks, and some are completely cured by treatment.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of beriberi in various parts of the body?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most important symptoms in various parts of the body are disorders of the nervous system and circulatory system, abnormal urination, respiratory symptoms, metabolic disorders, and fever.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms in the nervous system?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because beriberi is a type of polyneuritis, it is especially easy to invade the peripheral parts, so it first appears in the lower limbs and then in the upper limbs. Sensory disorders in neurological symptoms, such as numbness and abnormal sensations, often occur in the lower legs and dorsum of the feet to the upper legs, or from the fingers to the forearms and humerus, as well as the lower abdomen and around the mouth.</p>
<p>(Question) Do beriberi patients have motor disorders?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. The main motor disorder is paralysis, which is mostly unilateral. It starts in the lower limbs, especially the extensor muscles, forming an inverted foot shape (tiptoe position), which results in difficulty walking. Upper limb paralysis (decreased grip strength), respiratory muscle paralysis (difficulty breathing), laryngeal muscle paralysis (hoarseness), ocular muscle paralysis (drooping eyelids), and abdominal muscle paralysis (oliguria, urination disorders, constipation). There are also spasmodic movements (more severe in the lower limbs). There are also motor ataxia such as finger tremors.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there any changes in nerve reflexes in patients with beriberi?</p>
<p>(Answer) Reflexes are hyperactive in the early stage and disappear later. The disappearance of the knee-jerk reflex is the most common. Pupil reflexes are normal.</p>
<p>(Question) What changes occur in the sensory organs?</p>
<p>(Answer) Decreased vision or central scotoma.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of vasomotor nerves?</p>
<p>(Answer) Peripheral blood vessels contract, resulting in pale, dry skin, and reduced sweat secretion.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the circulatory symptoms after suffering from beriberi?</p>
<p>(Answer) The symptoms in the circulatory system include changes in pulse, blood pressure, and cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the pulse?</p>
<p>(Answer) The pulse is mostly rapid, ranging from ninety to one hundred beats per minute, and it is very weak, fast, and irregular. Therefore, it is very unstable.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the blood pressure?</p>
<p>(Answer) The maximum blood pressure reaches 140 mmHg. In shock-like beriberi, it can drop to 80 or 70 mmHg. The minimum blood pressure must drop to 40 or 30 or 10 mmHg.</p>
<p>(Question) What changes occur in the heart?</p>
<p>(Answer) On cardiac examination, the apical impulse is very strong. On palpation, the apical impulse is dilated and moves towards the side. On percussion, the area of cardiac dullness expands, reaching the upper right and then the upper left. On auscultation, there is a systolic murmur at the apex.</p>
<h3>Medical Treatment for Pain Relief (5)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>(4) Friction: Friction also has considerable value in relieving pain. Proper friction can relieve chronic pain, and appropriate friction when inflammation is about to subside can drive away the waste remaining in the tissues (cells) and excrete it. Note that this procedure must be performed after the inflammation has completely stopped, otherwise it will be contrary to the principle of rest and even aggravate the inflammation. This procedure is most suitable for neuritis (or cerebritis) and myositis. Whether friction is effective can be determined by its results. If the pain is reduced, the swelling disappears, and inactivity gradually becomes active, then it is a good result. If the result is the opposite, it means that the implementation is improper and harmful.</p>
<p>There is also a procedure called "kneading" that also has the effect of reducing swelling and relieving pain. The reason is that kneading the muscles can first disperse the waste remaining from inflammation hidden in them, and then excrete it away from the body through increased blood flow. This effect is like squeezing and releasing a sponge to completely refresh the water absorbed in the sponge. The muscles are the same. After kneading, old blood and waste are squeezed out, new blood fills in, restoring health and stopping pain in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>(5) Local Congestion Therapy: Local congestion therapy is very effective in relieving pain. Based on this principle, there are now many therapies. Some are very simple methods, and some seem to be very wonderful scientific methods.</p>
<p>(1) Using Heat: Applying appropriate heat to the painful part using appropriate methods can relieve pain. We have already said that the first requirement for pain relief is rest, and the second is the use of heat. This is also the most common method of pain relief, and it can be implemented everywhere. The effect of heat is to relax the tension of the inflamed part; because pain is directly proportional to tension—the greater the tension, the more severe the pain—so reducing the tension also reduces the pain.</p>
<p>There are many ways to use heat. The methods are different, but the principles are the same, and the results are generally the same. There are several ways to implement heat: (1) Wrapping with flannel or cotton. Pain on the surface of the skin can be relieved by wrapping or covering with flannel or cotton to avoid external stimulation to the painful area, thereby reducing pain and making the body comfortable. (2) Hot wet compresses can reduce tension, increase blood flow, and have a great pain-relieving effect. (3) Applying medicinal mud paste to the painful area. (4) Electric blankets are good for muscle, bone, wind, and dampness pain, but they are not something that ordinary people can enjoy. (5) Hot water bags are common household pain relievers, and they have considerable value when used properly. One disadvantage is that the weight of the hot water bag presses on the painful area. (6) Diathermy (commonly known as electrotherapy). This kind of heat is slightly better than other procedures in the deep muscles, but it does not have many miraculous effects. (7) Proper use of light bulbs and Edison lamps also has some pain-relieving effects. No matter what kind of heat therapy is used, rubbing it with some cold water immediately afterwards can make the blood gather in the painful area for a longer time, and the pain-relieving effect will be prolonged accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Counterirritation: This method involves using medication to cause an inflammatory effect on another part of the body, which can help relieve pain. There are two ways to achieve counterirritation: one is to rub the medication on the painful area and add friction, and the other is to rub the medication on the inflamed part without adding friction. Sometimes, causing a part of the skin to blister to relieve chronic pain is the same principle.</p>
<p>(3) Cold Therapy: For some deep pain, cold, such as a water bag, is also beneficial. Cold can reduce the tension of inflammation in heart pain, appendicitis pain, headache, and throat pain, so it can also reduce pain.</p>
<p>(4) Psychological Treatment: Some people's nerves are easily stimulated and they are very afraid of pain. The more afraid they are of pain, the more severe they feel the pain. Sometimes, some people's pain is entirely psychological. In fact, they have no pain. Such people need someone to enlighten and comfort them, and it is also permissible to implement the harmless pain-relieving methods mentioned above. If, instead of doing this, they are given anesthetics to numb their nerves at all times, then it is harmful to them and unhelpful, and their pain can never be stopped permanently. If they can be made to have an optimistic attitude and forget their small pain, it will be of real benefit to them.</p>
<p>Pain Relievers</p>
<p>Pain relievers generally fall into the following three categories: nerve sedatives, analgesics, and anesthetics. Each has its proper use. If used appropriately, there are many benefits. If used inappropriately, it will harm the body and waste money without helping the pain. I will omit it for now and describe it in detail later in the practical application.</p>
<p>The above has explained the principles of physiology, anatomy, and treatment. What has been said is limited to principles. As for the pain symptoms in various parts of the body, there are many, and the causes are different, so the treatment methods are also different. Therefore, one must first understand the pathology of various pain symptoms in order to apply the principles appropriately. Various types of pain have special pain-relieving methods, so they must be studied separately. There are several very common pain diseases that I will now discuss in particular, which I believe will be appreciated by readers.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Stomach pain is a very common ailment and also a lingering pain. Assuming that one in every hundred people has stomach pain, there are four million people with stomach pain in the country. Assuming that one in every four hundred people has stomach pain, there are one million people with stomach pain in the country. There are several kinds of stomach diseases that cause stomach pain. The diseases are different, and the pain-relieving methods are also different. They are described below for readers to study:</p>
<p>Gastritis: Generally speaking, gastritis refers to redness and swelling inside the stomach, and the patient feels stomach pain. This kind of stomach pain occurs when the stomach is hungry and also after eating. The most common causes of gastritis are indigestible food, eating too fast, excessive smoking and drinking, eating too cold or too hot food, or diseases of the mouth, nose, and throat, such as rotten teeth, or swallowing irritating drugs or poisons.</p>
<p>One must first understand these causes in order to have confidence in the treatment. The general pain-relieving methods are as follows: (1) Rest if the body can rest. Secondly, the stomach must rest. The method of resting the stomach is not to eat food for a short time. (2) Apply a hot wet compress to the upper abdomen several times a day. (3) Gradually increase the diet, starting with a small amount of egg white water (one egg white and a cup of warm water) or diluted milk or diluted lotus root powder soup, rice soup, or noodle soup. Later, gradually increase the intake of porridge and other soft foods. After the disease is completely cured, you can gradually return to your usual diet. Avoid indigestible foods and bad habits. (4) Smoking and drinking should be avoided. (5) Curing various diseases of the mouth, nose, and throat is also a necessary way to avoid gastritis.</p>
<p>Gastric Ulcer: Gastric ulcer is a very common ailment. There are no widespread statistics in our country, but there are accurate statistics in Europe and the United States. For example, 1.3% of the people in North America have gastric ulcers, 5% of the people in the United Kingdom have gastric ulcers, and 16.7% of the people in Denmark have gastric ulcers. From this, it can be seen that gastric ulcer is very common, and gastric pain is also a very common suffering.</p>
<p>Gastric ulcers grow on the inner lining of the stomach. The cause of gastric ulcers is often purulent infections of the mouth, nose, and throat, irritating foods, excessively spicy or sour foods, excessive smoking and drinking, etc. The pain of gastric ulcers is in the upper part of the abdomen below the sternum. Sometimes pain is also felt in the middle of the back. This kind of pain is often very punctual every day. For example, the pain stops after eating, and then it hurts again in an hour or two, and then it stops for a while. It is always painful like this day after day, year after year, but sometimes it is lighter and sometimes it is heavier. The severely ill are truly plagued by illness, suffering all the time, and there is no happiness in life. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(38) Myopia</p>
<p>There are many people in the world suffering from myopia, as it seems now. Because all countries in the world have entered the era of civilization, there is more time spent buried in eye work, so the opportunity to develop myopia is particularly easy. Conversely, in places that are not yet fully civilized, such as Africa, Mongolia, and Tibet, there are very few people suffering from myopia. This is because there is not much time spent on eye work in the first place (see item (3) below). If we explore the causes of myopia from medical history, there are theories of heredity, congestion, adjustment, radiation, optic nerve destruction, eye socket structure or revolving muscle, near work, and scleral extensibility, etc. These are all academic discussions. I am not going to explain and criticize them in detail now, but simply give a brief explanation of the general reasons for its establishment.</p>
<p>The establishment of myopia is due to the "reasons why the eye can see objects" described in the previous section, but the function of a camera cannot be implemented. This type of eye belongs to a type of ametropia. In other words, it is an eyeball with an unsound vision. Her ability can only see clearly at close range and cannot see clearly at a distance. Because the convexity of her lens is too large, or because her axial length is too long, the image produced by the light, although there is the adjustment of the iris contraction and expansion, the refraction of the lens, and her natural adjustment effect, cannot be completely and appropriately reflected on the retina. It can only be reflected in front of the retina (refer to the attached diagram). Therefore, all distant objects cannot be seen clearly. With this kind of myopic eyeball, it is of course necessary to use corrective glasses to assist.</p>
<p>Myopia has a close relationship with age, place, education, occupation, and heredity, etc. I will now explain it briefly by item. It can also be used as a reference for the causes of myopia.</p>
<p>(1) Relationship to Age! There are very few children who suffer from myopia in their childhood. When they reach the age of spring organ development, the number of sufferers gradually increases.</p>
<p>(2) Relationship to Place! Children in cities are more likely to suffer from myopia than children in rural areas.</p>
<p>(3) Relationship to Education! The degree of school is often directly proportional to the number of people suffering from myopia. That is, as the degree gradually increases, the number of sufferers also gradually increases. Among them, diligent students are more likely to suffer from it than lazy students. Therefore, countries with education often have more myopia.</p>
<p>(4) Relationship to Occupation! For example, literati, writers, calligraphers, painters, sculptors, as well as teachers, copyists, etc., often suffer from myopia.</p>
<p>(5) Relationship to Heredity! Myopia often has a hereditary predisposition. If the father is myopic in a family, then his son is often also myopic. This is the case in my family (the father is myopic and three out of four sons are myopic). By this reasoning, perhaps there are such facts in the families of you readers. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (44)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Clinical Course</p>
<p>(2) Acute Miliary Tuberculosis: The proliferative type is generally slightly better than the exudative type in severe condition; its course is mostly chronic, and the fever is not very high. The results of physical and blood image examinations are not as severe as those of the exudative type. However, the acute miliary tuberculosis type is a complete exception, and its prognosis is mostly poor. Its cause is the invasion of tubercle bacilli into the blood system, which has been described in Chapter 4 of this book! Its clinical course, according to the various symptoms of the patient, is divided into typhoid, meningeal, and pulmonary types. Its onset is sudden. The symptoms of the first type are very similar to those of typhoid fever. High fever, coma, slow pulse, splenomegaly, protein in the urine, positive Diazo reaction, normal or decreased white blood cell count, decreased red blood cells, and sometimes rose spots. These are all significant symptoms of typhoid fever, which can also occur here. However, his breathing is mostly very fast, which is relatively rare in typhoid fever. Not much can be obtained from the physical examination of the lungs. As for the most powerful evidence in these two aspects, we must of course recommend bacterial and X-ray examinations! The symptoms of the second type are very similar to those of meningitis. Increased temperature, headache, vomiting, slow pulse, neck spasm, stiff neck, generalized hyperesthesia, sunken and tense abdominal muscles, rigid pupils, or strabismus, etc.; these are all that should be available in ordinary epidemic meningitis. The most important recognition in this aspect is the proof of tubercle bacilli in the spinal fluid. The ordinary Tieboguling reaction is mostly negative; however, the intradermal reaction is sometimes positive, which must not be ignored. The symptoms of the third type are mostly focused on the pulmonary aspect. The patient is preceded by severe dry cough, increased breathing rate and difficulty, and small circulation disorders occur, resulting in cyanosis of the lips and face: high fever, rapid pulse, and changes in blood and urine are similar to those of typhoid fever. The physical examination of the lungs shows a slight dullness on percussion, sharp breath sounds on auscultation, and tracheal branching rales. Vesicular sounds rarely occur. Sometimes, due to the associated inflammation of the capillary bronchioles, acute pulmonary distention may occur. During this period, the range of clear lung sounds is of course broad downwards. ——The above-mentioned situation refers specifically to purely proliferative lesions: but if it is combined with exudative lesions, his pulmonary symptoms are more significant! Like strong dullness, multiple tracheal branching sounds, and crepitant rales; that is, the proof of tubercle bacilli in sputum is also very common.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of acute miliary tuberculosis is sometimes not easy to make. Several well-known diseases, such as typhoid fever, septic pyemia, central pneumonia, and malaria, are all in the differential diagnosis. The most important examinations in this aspect are of course X-ray fluoroscopy and the proof of tubercle bacilli in the spine! Detailed examination of the eyes must not be easily overlooked sometimes. Its prognosis is mostly poor: the exception of a few turning danger into safety is that it turns into chronic miliary tuberculosis. When it first occurs, the severity of the symptoms is relatively mild; after a considerable period of time, the high fever drops, and the difficulty in breathing does not occur. That is, the ordinary general condition can be improved day by day; as a result, the patient's life is extended, sometimes for a very long time.</p>

<h3>Commissioner of the Ministry of Health Inspects Health Conditions in Fujian Province: A Record</h3>
<p>Since Chairman Chen of Fujian Province took office, he has strived for construction, and many neglected matters have been revitalized. Among these, public health is of utmost importance. He is actively planning to improve it, so he requested the Ministry of Health of the Interior to dispatch health experts for inspection. Section Chief Yao Yongzheng and Physician Sun Zhirong, among others, were appointed and first went to western Fujian to investigate the newly recovered bandit areas. They investigated the actual situation of epidemic outbreaks, and also carried a large quantity of medicines, distributing them along the way for relief. This trip lasted two months, passing through more than ten places, including Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Longyan, Shanghang, Gutian, Liancheng, Xinquan, Pengkou, Wenfang, Zhongwu Village, Changting, Nanshanba, and Hetian. Mosquito larvae were found in large numbers along the way. Three months prior, malaria and dysentery were rampant in western Fujian, resulting in numerous deaths. The situation has now greatly improved. In Changting, a epidemic prevention committee has been established to provide medical relief, and the provincial government has also sent a previous medical relief team to participate in on-site work. However, this area was previously occupied by Red Bandits for several years, and epidemics raged. Medical facilities are quite lacking, and the suffering is indescribable. In Longyan, bubonic plague was also discovered last year. The Harbor Quarantine Administration sent personnel for bacterial testing and animal inoculation experiments, which confirmed the diagnosis. They worked with local authorities to eradicate the disease, and fortunately it did not spread. No plague was found in Liancheng and Changting. In Hui'an, cases of bubonic plague were also discovered in one person last year and another two weeks ago. Both were isolated and treated at the Xiamen Harbor Quarantine Hospital. In Yanping, plague was also discovered in Xiaorenzhou at the end of last year, resulting in over a hundred deaths. Through various rescue efforts, the situation has been stabilized. Regarding Fuzhou, the streets are quite clean. Chairman Chen is currently planning to establish a provincial hospital, a health testing laboratory, an isolation hospital, and a leprosy hospital, among other facilities, to expand health and medical equipment. The Health Section of the Provincial Public Security Bureau is working hard to improve sanitation and is stepping up its efforts. It also has an attached hospital. In Zhangzhou, there was the Minnan Hospital, which was well-equipped, but it is now closed, which is a great pity. The Civil Affairs Department has a Health Section, and Zheng Zhenwen, the Director of the Education Department, pays close attention to health education. Gao Zhibin, a specialist on the Health Education Committee, is also very dedicated. All schools have health rooms, and the Science Museum has a parasite research laboratory. School principals and teachers attend training courses during annual vacations to facilitate smooth operations. Therefore, although the province's health education has only been established for over half a year, the results are already remarkable and will be gradually promoted to achieve universal coverage. Yao and Sun were very impressed with this inspection. They took the Xinpu ship yesterday from Fujian to Shanghai and will soon return to Beijing to report on their findings, hoping that the central government will have a more planned approach to expanding and promoting health in Fujian Province.</p>

<h3>Salt Industry Control and the Future of Salt Administration</h3>
<p>— Qitong</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Salt is the second most essential commodity for the daily lives of citizens, and its importance is no less than that of fuel and grain. Therefore, all countries in the East and West regard supervising the production and sale of salt as one of the key state policies. This is partly to protect the health of the people and partly to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating the market and undermining people's livelihoods. The importance of salt affairs as a key state policy has a long history in our country, as it is a major source of revenue for the national treasury. Even today, salt tax is second only to customs duty in importance to the national treasury. However, the salt administration system in our country is complex and chaotic, as it has been since ancient times. Long-standing problems have been inherited, and there has never been a day of rectification. This has gradually undermined the strength of the people and become the most harmful policy of the country, which is truly regrettable. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Legislative Yuan passed a new salt law, which cleared up long-standing problems and abolished all the complex and chaotic salt administration regions and systems. It was truly an unprecedented good deed in history, hitting the nail on the head, meeting needs, and a masterpiece of benefiting the country and the people. It is a pity that the law was enacted but not implemented, and the system was abolished but still exists, which is truly lamentable. In the past three years, the government has reorganized the salt tax three times, such as the reorganization of production areas and tax rates in various provincial border areas in July of the eleventh year, the general reorganization of salt area tax rates in October of the twenty-second year, and the implementation of the new balance system in the city and the regulation of regular and additional salt tax rates announced on New Year's Day of the twenty-third year. However, because these measures were aimed at treating the symptoms rather than the root cause, and the focus was only on increasing salt tax revenue rather than thoroughly reforming the system, they had little to do with the fundamental problems of salt administration. Salt administration is still a harmful policy, as it always has been. Recently, news of controlling the salt industry has suddenly appeared in the newspapers. How to specifically implement this control is currently unknown. However, based on the inherent meaning of control, all those who are familiar with the inside story of salt administration generally know that this is just a way to appear innovative and different, but in reality, there is no way to implement it, nor is it necessary. Therefore, based on what I know, I offer several suggestions, hoping to seek correction from those who advocate control.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>There are two targets of control: one is foreign goods that infringe on the domestic market, and the other is domestic goods that are oversupplied. For the former, the aim is to prevent imported goods from burdening the domestic market. In short, it is to restrict the import of goods that are unnecessary or harmful to the domestic market. For the latter, the aim is to coordinate the domestic production and sales of goods to prevent overproduction or shortage. Therefore, the primary meaning of control is originally to deal with foreign goods, and its secondary meaning is to coordinate domestic production and sales. If we use this to measure salt industry control, then salt is not an ordinary commodity, and foreign goods can never invade the Chinese market, so the first meaning of control no longer exists. Therefore, it is said that it is unnecessary. As for coordinating domestic production and sales, under the current existence of exclusive merchants and contractors, control cannot fulfill this task, because on top of the exclusive merchant and contractor system, there is no way to add a control system. Furthermore, let's discuss it further.</p>
<p>Under free trade, the production of goods is entirely market-oriented. As for whether the market can absorb its products, that is not what it asks. This is called anarchic production. If production is market-oriented but does not consider the market's absorption capacity, then the result of producers competing for profit will inevitably be overproduction and market stagnation, leading to economic panic. In order to avoid the reaction after this kind of excessive expansion, governments manage production and sales and use statistical methods to seek consistency between supply and demand. This seems to be another meaning of control, which is to address unrestricted free competition. The salt administration system in our country has some areas that have been opened up and are implementing a free trade system, but the open areas are scattered and fragmented. The areas around them are all fixed with designated sales regions, and there is no way to freely transport and sell. Therefore, although it is nominally open, it is still in a closed state. In addition to those who are open and operate as free merchants, there are exclusive merchants, contractors, government transport, and government monopolies. The complexity of the divisions can be described as indescribable. However, if we try to analyze it, the exclusive merchant system has fixed salt administration regions, and the amount of transport and sales is also limited. In fact, it has already exceeded the limits of control, except that the control lies in the exclusive merchant, not in the government. As for contractors, they are entirely responsible for the quota recognized by the merchants. Within their regions, the contractors can do whatever they want, raising or lowering salt prices at will. The government not only has no right to interfere, but also has the obligation to set up tax police to protect the contractors' exclusive rights. In reality, it is no different from government monopoly, except that the monopoly power lies in the contractor. As for government transport and government sales, it is already the ultimate expression of control, so why wait for control? Therefore, looking at the salt system in our country as a whole, if there are exclusive merchants, contractors, government transport, and government sales, they have already exceeded the scope of control. What can be controlled is only the free transport and sales areas after opening up. However, these areas are scattered in various places, and they are mostly areas bordering several salt administration regions. The source of their salt is not fixed. If control is used to restrict their source, then it is to reverse the region of free transport and sales and return to the era of nationwide contractors, exclusive merchants, or government transport and government sales. If the source is not limited, then what is the point of control? Therefore, this is not a viable path. However, even if it is viable, it is a backward step. Today, the whole country is demanding the opening up of salt areas. Now, if we go against the trend and re-close the areas that have already been opened, wouldn't that be like rowing upstream? Therefore, even if this path is feasible, it is absolutely impossible to implement.</p>
<p>If it is said that the area of control is not only in the areas that have been opened up, but in the whole country, then let's ask, on top of the government transport and government sales system, what control can be implemented? As for the exclusive merchant and contractor systems, the government has already given merchants the right to contract or exclusively manage, so how can control be added? Therefore, if the target of control is the whole country, then the problem lies in the fact that there is no way to implement it at all. Perhaps the original intention of the advocates is to implement control after the whole country is fully opened up to a free merchant system, then that is an overly advanced theory. Today, the most important thing is to promote the universal establishment of a free transport and sales system and to promote the early implementation of the new salt law. As for control after the establishment of a free transport and sales system, there is no way to discuss it at this time. Moreover, at that time, there will be no dumping of foreign goods, and the government can supervise and collect small taxes at any time, so control can be implemented at any time. It is extremely easy to do, so we do not need to plan for it in advance at this time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the control of salt is neither possible nor necessary. As for using a good name to seek heavy taxation, that is not within the scope of our discussion. However, the burden of salt tax on the people has become unspeakably heavy. Haven't you heard of poor people who eat bland food everywhere? The melons on Huangtai, how can they be picked again? This is what we believe is absolutely unacceptable. In short, the reason why salt has become a harmful policy today is definitely not due to the lack of control. What are the real drawbacks of salt administration? What is the way out in the future? We would like to discuss it further.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The biggest drawbacks of salt administration today, from the perspective of the government's finances, are three main points: one is the proliferation of smuggled salt in the market, which infringes on the sales of official salt, causing the government's revenue to decrease. To compensate for this loss, the government is bound to raise the salt tax further, but the higher the salt tax, the more profitable it is for smugglers, the more rampant the smuggling of salt, and the more the government's revenue is affected. The second is the existence of a system of personal gain and embezzlement, which encroaches on the government's revenue. The third is the excessive scope of anti-smuggling efforts, with uneconomical manpower and expenses. Moreover, due to the great prevalence of smuggling, anti-smuggling efforts must be stricter, and expenditure on expenses increases. From the perspective of the people, there are also three important points: one is the extraordinarily heavy burden of salt tax, which makes many people unable to afford it, and thus they have to eat bland food or buy nitrate salt. The second is the unfairness of the burden, with the division of salt areas being extremely strict. Neighboring areas look at each other as if they are foreign countries, with a difference of tens of times in salt prices across a small piece of land. The third is the government's excessive interference. In order to strictly implement the salt area system, anti-smuggling areas are everywhere in the country, which is an excessive oppression in the eyes of the people.</p>
<p>The above six points are the major problems of salt administration today. However, if we carefully examine the occurrence of these six major drawbacks, they are all due to the complexity of the salt administration system and the existence of the designated sales region system. If the salt areas are complex and erroneous, and the salt administration is either contracted, exclusive, or government-operated, and they are all different, the prices will inevitably be high and low. Moreover, because the division of salt areas does not conform to the current transportation system, the transportation costs are very different, and the disparity in salt prices is even greater. Driven by profit, the smuggling of salt is rampant. Moreover, because the salt areas are complex and the salt tax collection system is inconsistent, many people are used, and petty criminals can take advantage of the situation. Furthermore, the collection agencies are complex and scattered, and auditing and inspection are not easy. Embezzlement and personal gain are thus unavoidable. Furthermore, the salt areas are scattered throughout the country, and anti-smuggling agencies have to be established all over the country, so that the number of salt police is almost equal to the police who maintain public order. All these three points are based on the complexity of the salt areas and the salt system. On the people's side, the harm caused by the different salt areas and salt systems is even deeper. Under the exclusive merchant and contractor systems, merchants are driven by profit and cannot care about the lives and deaths of the people. Salt prices rise and fall freely under their manipulation and monopoly, and the small people have no way to live. As for the unfairness of the burden and the excessive interference of the tax police, they are all based on the complex complexity of the salt areas and salt system and need no further elaboration. Therefore, after all the complicated reasons, the root cause is the complexity of the salt system and the errors in the salt areas. Today's policy that hits the nail on the head is to abolish this salt administration system and sales region system that are the source of all evils. This is the proper way to immediately implement the new salt law. What we want to repeatedly ask the authorities to pay attention to is that the reform of salt administration and the way out for salt administration lie in the established new salt law, and not in any other plans that raise high names but do not meet the actual needs. It must be known that the harm of salt administration today is no less than that of the likin tax in those years. The government was able to abolish the likin tax system with the greatest effort. Can it be said that it is unable to avoid completing the reform of the salt system? That is certainly not the case.</p>
<h3>Chinese Salt Tax Amidst Calls for Reform</h3>
<p>— Du Lao</p>
<p>At the recent Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, CEC member Chen Juying and others proposed the establishment of a Salt Administration Reform Committee to be put in place promptly and tasked to implement the salt law within one year. At the same time, the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office is also proposing the control of edible salt, which has already attracted attention from all circles. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce to readers the general situation regarding salt tax and salt law.</p>
<p>The collection of salt tax in China is restricted by loan agreements, and is controlled by the powers, just like customs duties. Each year, approximately 10 million yuan is allocated from salt tax revenue to pay for the principal and interest on these loans. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, the National Government began negotiations with the Director-General of Salt Affairs Inspection. As a result, the Salt Affairs Inspection Office nominally became an agency directly under the Ministry of Finance, and at the end of the seventeenth year, the General Inspection Office was moved from Beiping to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the two years that followed, many inspection sub-offices that had been suspended during the civil war were successively restored, and salt affairs gradually returned to normal. Although the civil war still broke out intermittently, and the situation of regional division was not completely eliminated in fact, salt tax revenue was still able to increase year by year. After the Northeast was occupied, salt tax revenue followed with a sharp decline, but in the most recent two years it has returned to normal.</p>
<p>In June of the twentieth year, the National Government promulgated the new salt law. The new salt law includes the following seven chapters: 1. General Provisions, 2. Production, 3. Storage, 4. Salt Pan Salt Prices, 5. Salt Tax Collection, 6. Salt Affairs Agencies, 7. Supplementary Provisions. The first article of the salt law stipulates that salt tax should be collected at the place of production; people can freely buy and sell edible salt, and no merchant is allowed to monopolize the salt industry. Salt tax is collected in three grades: 1. Edible salt, taxed at five yuan per 100 kilograms; 2. Fishery salt, taxed at three jiao per 100 kilograms; 3. Industrial and agricultural salt is exempt from salt tax; all of the above items are not allowed to be collected with additional levies.</p>
<p>The production of salt is also strictly managed by the government. According to the provisions of Article 10 of the salt law, the government should set up methods in the salt pans to restrict the production of salt and the annual output, so that the production and consumption of salt throughout the country can be mutually suitable. Those salt pans that produce very little salt, or are excessively dispersed, and are inconvenient to manage, may be canceled or merged if the government considers them unnecessary. The government should build salt warehouses in suitable locations in the salt pans for storing salt; private individuals are prohibited from setting up warehouses to store salt. Salt affairs officials are responsible for consulting the opinions of salt pan representatives to determine salt prices. Article 33 of the salt law stipulates the establishment of a Salt Administration Department, which, like the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office, is directly under the Ministry of Finance. The Salt Administration Department manages all salt administrative matters, organizes salt police, manages salt warehouses, and inspects, receives, and returns edible salt. The Salt Affairs General Inspection Office is responsible for collecting taxes, supervising the receipt of edible salt, and filling out reports. According to the provisions of Article 37 of the salt law, a Salt Administration Reform Committee should also be established, directly under the Executive Yuan, to solve the problem of salt tax reform.</p>
<p>On the government side, painstaking efforts have been made to plan the reform of salt affairs, but no implementation has been seen. Although the promulgation of the new salt law has exceeded three years, it is still an unredeemed check. The unification of salt tax has had such a brilliant decree as early as the second year of the Republic of China (Order No. 43 promulgated by the Provisional Government); the purpose of the new salt law in the twentieth year is also to unify salt tax, but it has never been realized. In 1933 (the twenty-second year), among the total amount of edible salt consumed nationwide, 17.8 percent was taxed at less than one yuan per dan; 28.3 percent was taxed at one to three yuan per dan; 34.7 percent was taxed at three to six yuan per dan; 6.5 percent was taxed at six to nine yuan per dan; and 12.7 percent was taxed at nine to twelve yuan per dan. Salt tax rates are not only different from province to province; they are also different within the same province. As for additional levies, they are even more impossible to cancel. The following figures tell us that salt tax surcharges still occupied an important position in the government's income in 1933:</p>
<p>Salt Tax Revenue in 1933</p>
<p>(1) Central government's regular tax and surcharges 28,012,949.03 yuan</p>
<p>(2) Provincial government's surcharges 19,199,038.00 yuan</p>
<p>(3) Foreign debt surcharges 7,815,165.10 yuan</p>
<p>(4) Miscellaneous taxes 5,727,907.06 yuan</p>
<p>(5) Other 5,857,160.79 yuan</p>
<p>Total 56,881,260.03 yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance in the twenty-first year attempted to transfer salt affairs administrative work to the staff of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and Zhu Tingqi, the Deputy Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office, concurrently served as the Director of the Salt Affairs General Office. Chinese officials from various local Salt Affairs Inspection Sub-offices also concurrently served as directors of transportation bureaus, deputy directors of sales bureaus, and other positions in salt affairs administration and anti-smuggling. Many salt affairs offices were abolished or merged. This method of the Ministry of Finance was approved by the Executive Yuan, and the results were quite satisfactory. The work efficiency of salt affairs administration was improved, and administrative expenses were reduced. The Salt Affairs Inspection General Office's report in the twenty-first year stated that "this centralized method improves work efficiency, and at the same time, due to the merger of redundant agencies, it is possible to save operating efficiency, eliminate irregularities, reduce the cost of edible salt, and facilitate transportation and sales." Perhaps this is not a lie.</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign debts guaranteed by salt tax revenue, they are often not repaid on time. From 1928 to 1933, only the Sino-British loan was reduced from 2.75 million pounds sterling to 1.5 million pounds sterling; in addition, various foreign debts were not reduced at all.</p>
<p>End of 1928 End of 1933</p>
<p>Sino-British Loan (1908) 2,750,000.25 1,500,000.25 pounds</p>
<p>Railway Loan (1911) 5,636,790.13 5,636,860.55 pounds</p>
<p>Provisional Government Loan (1912) 4,584,175.10 4,584,157.10 pounds</p>
<p>Qingdao Bonds 13,000,000.35 13,000,000.75 pounds</p>
<p>96 Million Yuan Loan 31,478,400.20 31,478,400.32 pounds</p>
<p>(Japanese Portion)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, salt tax occupies an important position in the Chinese government's revenue; indeed, it is the second pillar of Chinese finance. In the central budget for the twenty-third year (July 1934 to June 1935), salt tax revenue was estimated at 190,353,851 yuan, customs duty revenue was estimated at 366,413,791 yuan, and the total revenue of the National Government was 918,111,034 yuan. From this perspective, the combined revenue from customs duties and salt tax accounts for a large portion of the National Government's total revenue. It seems that a large portion of the nation's revenue relies on the heavy burden on the frail shoulders of the poor.</p>
<p>The reason why indirect taxes occupy an unusually important position in China is undoubtedly closely related to political disunity and social instability. In European and American countries, indirect taxes have been recognized as a bad tax collection method and are often criticized. But in China, to rely on direct taxes to offset huge expenditures is still an impossible dream. What we dare to hope from the government now is only to abolish exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes and unify tax rates. Although this is work that the government has long promised to the people of the whole country, its substantial completion still awaits the future.</p>
<h3>After Reading the Summary of the Salt Affairs Statistical Report</h3>
<p>— Chen Mianzhi</p>
<p>Our country's salt affairs have a long history, and the accumulated malpractices are also deep-rooted. The common people suffer deeply, yet they do not know what salt affairs are. Those who talk about reform tend to be lofty and impractical, failing to address the real issues. Amidst the calls for salt affairs reform, the Salt Affairs Audit General Office has compiled and printed "Summary of the Statistical Report of the Salt Affairs Audit Office," which details the situation of salt affairs since the Republic of China and is quite valuable for our attention. A few days ago, I received a copy from Mr. Zhu Tingqi, the Director-General of the Office, and after reading it, it allowed me to glimpse a corner of the Office's activities. The book was compiled by Mr. Zuo Shuzhen, the chief editor of the Office, and it thoroughly describes the history of salt affairs reorganization in recent years. Among them, the chapter on tax collection and salt release statistics lists various statistics to prove the achievements of the Audit Office. Although the listed figures may not be entirely complete, they are sufficient for general researchers of salt affairs to use as a reference. The first chapter of the book describes the state of salt affairs agencies before the second year of the Republic (1913), and it accurately points out the dark aspects of the previous salt affairs agencies in terms of salt production sites, salt release, tax rates, and salt funds. The reader becomes more convinced that salt is both a source of profit and a breeding ground for corruption. The second chapter discusses the efficiency of the Audit Office after its establishment, divided into four periods: (1) the initial period (1913-1917), (2) the organizational completion period (1918-1923), (3) the period of interference by local authorities (1924-1929), and (4) the recovery and reorganization period (1929-1933). Due to space limitations, I will omit the details. The third chapter, on tax collection and salt release statistics, lists the salt tax revenue and salt release figures for the past twenty years, divided into four periods, to show the reasons for increases and decreases. It also compares areas where the Audit Office concurrently handled administrative anti-smuggling affairs with areas where it did not, to demonstrate the progress in tax revenue and the reduction in expenses after the Audit Office concurrently handled administrative anti-smuggling. However, the table only lists percentages and lacks detailed figures, making it difficult for readers to deeply understand the underlying reasons. The actual expenditure of the Audit Office over the years is known to very few outsiders, and various misunderstandings often arise from this. It seems that a valuable statistic should be made of the actual expenditures and balances over the years, so that the general public can understand the actual situation of the Audit Office. Mr. Zuo believes that the increase in the total tax revenue during the fourth period, the so-called recovery and reorganization period, is related to the increase in tax rates, but he attributes the rapid increase to the reorganization of the Audit Office. This kind of argument seems quite reasonable on the surface. However, if we study the tax revenue and salt release figures over the years as a whole, we will find that the so-called rapid increase in tax revenue is not only related to the increase in tax rates. If the current tax rates were still calculated according to the average tax rates of the first period, we would see a very large drop in tax revenue, which can be clearly proven by the fact that the amount of salt released has decreased in recent years. Now, I will list the tax revenue, salt release, and average tax rates from 1914 to 1933, according to the four periods divided in the book, to clarify the real reasons for the increase and decrease in tax revenue.</p>
<p>General Table of Tax Revenue, Salt Release, and Average Tax Rates from 1914 to 1933</p>
<p>(Notes) (1) The figures listed in the table are limited to those managed by the Audit Office.</p>
<p>(2) The figures for tax revenue and salt release in the three northeastern provinces from 1931 to 1933 are based on the average of the years 1929 and 1930.</p>
<p>(3) The average tax rates listed in the table are calculated from the salt release and tax revenue figures, as the tax rate statistics for each region over the years are incomplete.</p>
<p>(4) After the change of scales in 1933, the tax rates increased accordingly, but are not included for the time being due to incomplete figures.</p>
<p>Looking at the total tax revenue of each period listed in the table above, except for the third period, they mostly increased year by year. However, to claim this increase as an achievement of reorganization would be a misunderstanding. The amount of salt released listed in the table has not increased. Compared with 1933 and 1922 and 1923, there is a decrease. Since salt release has decreased rather than increased, the rapid increase in tax revenue must have other reasons, which can be clearly seen by looking at the increase in the average tax rate in the table. The average tax rate shown in the table was 2.63 yuan per dan in the first period, 2.53 yuan per dan in the second period, 2.15 yuan per dan in the third period, and suddenly increased to 4 yuan per dan in the fourth period. It is well known that tax rates increased after the implementation of the change of scales in 1934. From this, it can be seen that the increase in tax rates is the main reason for the rapid increase in tax revenue, which is self-evident. However, Mr. Zuo ignored this point, making it difficult for people to understand. As for the increase in tax revenue in areas where the Audit Office concurrently handles administrative and anti-smuggling affairs, although it is related to partial reorganization, the fact that tax revenue in areas such as Fujian and Changlu has plummeted due to various reasons shows that the increase or decrease in tax revenue is not entirely dependent on whether or not the Audit Office concurrently handles administrative and anti-smuggling affairs. In other words, if the environment is very bad, concurrent handling may not be effective, while if the environment improves, there should be better results even without concurrent handling. For example, the Huaibei area is relatively satisfactory among all areas, and the salt release situation has made good progress, but the reasons for this progress are not simple. The expansion of sales areas is also a reason, as there are many cases of Huai salt being transported and sold in areas originally designated for Lu salt and Sichuan salt.</p>
<p>The actual expenditure of the Audit Office is known to very few outsiders, as mentioned earlier. It is regrettable that the book did not include these figures. As far as we know, the expenses of the Audit Office are far greater than those of other government agencies. In the first period, the average annual expenditure was slightly less than 1.6 million yuan; in the second period, the average annual expenditure was slightly less than 3.9 million yuan; in the third period, the average annual expenditure was more than 6.5 million yuan; and in the fourth period, excluding expenses such as pensions, reserve funds, and tax police corps, the average annual expenditure was more than 6.3 million yuan. If the above-mentioned expenses are fully included, the average annual expenditure must be more than 15 million yuan. From this, it can be seen that the expenses in the fourth period were indeed much higher than before. It is said that the Office has a large amount of surplus funds due to the generous budget, which is deposited in Shanghai banks under the guise of reserve funds. It is said that this reserve fund has been audited twice by accountants, but the exact amount is still unknown. But if we compare the expense figures published by the Audit Office over the years with the actual expenditures, it is possible that there is a surplus of 1 to 2 million yuan each year. If the Audit Office authorities could list these figures in a table, it would be of great value.</p>
<p>I have already discussed tax revenue, salt release, and expenses above. The last chapter of the book, which describes the reform of the Audit Office and clarifies misunderstandings, is mostly repetitive and does not need to be commented on. As for the advantages of the Audit Office mentioned, although they are not described in detail, in all fairness, the Audit Office is still relatively successful among the tax revenue agencies in our country. Mr. Zhu Tingqi, the Director-General of the Office, is committed to reforming salt affairs, and his spirit is also unmatched by others. Now, based on the principle of holding the virtuous accountable in the Spring and Autumn Annals, I offer a few suggestions for selection.</p>
<p>(1) Seek improvement. Since the Audit Office has achieved considerable success, it should focus on reorganizing salt affairs and not imitate popular practices by simply engaging in publicity. Suggestions for researching salt affairs should be sincerely accepted and not dismissed as slander. New employees should first be sent to work in the field, and only after they have gained experience should they be given higher positions. The existing examination system should be strictly maintained to prevent opportunism and to give low-level staff the opportunity to be promoted step by step.</p>
<p>(2) Save expenses. The enormous expenses of the Audit Office are an undeniable fact. Recently, when the Legislative Yuan was reviewing the national budget for 1934, it also considered it necessary to substantially reduce salt affairs expenses. Therefore, the Office should try its best to reduce expenses within the possible scope to comply with the principle of saving money. For example, various allowances can be cancelled, salaries that are too high can be reduced, redundant personnel can be laid off, overlapping agencies can be merged, and extravagant expenses can be eliminated. However, job security and the provision of pensions, which are originally advantages of the Audit Office, should be maintained to promote integrity. However, pensions should be paid in a lump sum upon retirement to be true to their name. Currently, they are often paid once every three or four years, which is actually a kind of unexpected salary increase.</p>
<p>(3) Increase tax revenue. According to experts, the total amount of salt sold in our country each year should be more than 50 million dan. However, in recent years, the average amount sold has been less than 40 million dan, which means that tax evasion and smuggled salt account for more than two-fifths. This shows that anti-smuggling efforts were previously insufficient, resulting in smuggled salt still flooding various regions. Another major reason for the prevalence of smuggled salt is the excessive tax rates. In other words, the current tax increase policy is actually encouraging smuggling. Therefore, in order to get to the root of the problem and promote the progress of salt tax, it is necessary to reduce taxes to compete with smuggling, so that the public can afford to eat cheap official salt. Then, the sales of smuggled salt will naturally be cut off, and smugglers will not be willing to engage in this illegal career. At the same time, it is necessary to improve anti-smuggling efforts. Investigations have shown that anti-smuggling expenses have increased significantly in recent years, but the results are rarely seen. In the future, the tax police in each region should be properly assigned, and anti-smuggling work should be carried out within the scope of their duties. They should not act rashly and provoke incidents, as seen in the recent cases of Daming and Chongming, which can serve as a warning. In short, in order to eliminate smuggled salt and increase tax revenue, force alone will not work. It is necessary to address the root cause of the problem and seek a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>The above points are only mentioned in terms of the current urgent needs. As for fundamental issues, such as the originally planned political system and the implementation of salt laws, the recent Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Legislative Yuan have had thorough discussions. The Fifth Plenary Session resolved to implement the salt law within a time limit and to establish a salt administration reform committee, which is a necessary plan at a time when the people of the country are eager to reform salt affairs. The Legislative Yuan discussed establishing a salt administration department, streamlining the political system, and reducing expenses, which also addressed the current malpractices. It is hoped that the government will resolutely and decisively urge its implementation in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market Long Dormant, Thinking of Rising Last Week</h3>
<p>From March 4th to 9th last week, the trading at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually became lively. It went from hovering and stagnant to subtle brewing, and then to a gradual rise in the wind. The upward and downward trends were completely shrouded in the atmosphere of international loans. This matter is of great importance, with many twists and turns. The public debt market is the most sensitive. Due to the financial crisis in Shanghai, various exchanges had heavily shorted, and could no longer hold their positions. It is expected that the market price will continue to fluctuate before the international loan is finalized, but the trend will ultimately be a curve upward. Checking the progress of the market situation last week, it gradually improved day by day. It initially hovered, then firmed, and finally rose. The shift from short to long on the 16th was obvious. Short covering and arbitrage transactions also gradually became lively. Major players such as numbers 21, 38, and 48 mostly bought in daily. The market price rose steadily and strongly. Number 22 Customs, which was previously neglected due to the gradual selling by the financial sector and the low market price, is now avoiding the heavy and choosing the light, and speculative trading is flocking to it. Those who have been dormant for a long time are now vying to buy in, with a spring cloud unfolding. The future is promising. After the continuous decline of the 23 Customs, new lows have appeared, and the decline is even greater than the previous surge. It has now stabilized. In summary, the market price results, except for 22 Customs, which fell 1.5 yuan due to policy reasons, all other varieties rose by several jiao to 2.45 yuan. The total transaction volume was 111.8461 million yuan. The rise and fall results are listed in the following table (unit: yuan, transaction unit: half yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Downward Trend of US Cotton Gradually Strengthens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with a flat and weak market. Each month fell by three or four pounds initially. Then, due to unfavorable Liverpool news, foreign merchants sold off and bulls closed out positions, and prices softened. Fellow traders still bought in during the price decline, and the market still felt loose. The spot price fell by 15 pounds, old cotton fell by 16 or 17 pounds, and lint cotton fell by 25 or 26 pounds. British cotton was affected by the weakness of foreign cotton. The spot price fell by 5 points, and the futures price fell by 3 or 4 points. Indian cotton fell due to selling by traders in the market. Later, there were slight spread buys. Raw Lamb fell by 3.5 rupees, and White Roe fell by 4. Original telegram (dated 9th).</p>

<h3>Grain: Northern Japonica Rice is Reduced Again by 1 to 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly 30 ships arrived from various exchanges (nearly 6,000 shi of goods in total), but sales have become stagnant. There are very few inquiries on this street, and guest brokers have only purchased 400 to 500 bags from the Yantai exchange. Therefore, the situation has turned weak, and the market price has declined. The price of thick japonica rice has fallen by several fen, and thin rice has fallen sharply by 1 jiao or more. Du Jian rice has not seen ups or downs. Yin Yuan rice lacks sales, and the market price is uniquely beautiful.</p>

<h3>Not a Personal Attack</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Mr. Lin Xijun's "More Essays," which also "replied" to me. I really can't believe that Mr. Lin's five or six essays attacking essays all flowed out "unintentionally." If there is indeed a little intentionality mixed in, then whether it is "personal opinion" or "high opinion," everyone has the right to criticize it.</p>
<p>It is true that I did not quote the full text of Mr. Lin's work. But in reality, I can't copy out the entire article. If I am really attacking Mr. Lin, then I am attacking his opinion, not his person. I am attacking his entire opinion on essays, not just one or two articles.</p>
<p>If there are no excellent essays at present, it should be a matter of the writer's talent, not a matter of the style of the essay. However, Mr. Lin has always scolded the short size of essays, saying they are "trivial" and that they replace "serious work." But he is "definitely not a formalist or mechanist." This is really puzzling. It seems that it was also Mr. Lin who believed that last year was a year of popular essays. It is said that the prevalence of essays also hindered the production of great works. So until now, he still insists: "The more essays are promoted, the more essayists emerge, the more difficult it is for great works to appear." The great works that Mr. Lin speaks of are limited to the novels, poems, and dramas that he admires. Since no great novels, poems, or dramas appeared last year, then this major responsibility seems to only fall on the shoulders of the prevailing essays. Doesn't Mr. Lin also acknowledge the "vigorousness" of essays, and even think it is a "small success"?</p>
<p>However, now he no longer believes it. This is really "strange."</p>
<p>Essayists do not hope to use a short article to represent the entire society. They only hope to faithfully represent a branch and a section of it, because connecting the branches and sections is equivalent to the entire society. Since Mr. Lin believes that "it is absolutely impossible to hope for the production of great works by hoping for these essayists who write essays," then it can be seen that "the endless presentation of rich themes around the author waiting for us to take and create novels, poems, and dramas can only be taken by the great writers who despise meager essays. But he also asks the essayists: "Why do you only come up with a little bit of an essay that is hardly a literary creation?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lin believes that essayists can absolutely not write great works, but he wants them to write them. The essayists did not write novels, poems, and dramas with rich themes, so they are scolded; Mr. Lin, who despises essays, also did not write them, but he scolds people for it. Is this also doing some "serious work"? No, he is actually "playing tricks."</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to use a "demon-revealing mirror."</p>
<p>Mr. Lin has repeatedly used essays to express his contempt for essays, which has become a well-known fact. This time he said: "Great works are developing in the minds of other authors who despise the existence of essays." That's right, Mr. Lin despises essays the most, so: "Great works are developing in the mind of Lin Xijun, who despises the existence of essays."</p>
<h3>People and Books</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Critique of "Water Margin"</p>
<p>After the Reform Movement, there were quite a few people who discussed novels from a relatively new perspective. Liang Qichao, of course, compiled the views of friends on novels into "Collection of Novel Talks" in "New Novels." In another major publication, "Novel Forest," "Man's" "Short Talks on Novels" was also serialized, and there were also many very important historical materials on novels. In its critical section, there is a critique of "Water Margin," saying: "The book 'Water Margin' is purely about socialism. Its high regard for the 108 heroes can be said to be extreme. Since the dawn of history, there has never been a government organized by over a hundred people, where everyone has equal qualifications and yet order is maintained, where everyone has independent talents and yet they are not improperly assigned. The Liangshan stronghold is almost a utopia. Calling it the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness, 'loyalty' means fulfilling oneself, and 'righteousness' means acting and proclaiming it. It is indeed vastly different from the loyalty and righteousness of the 'slaves' cursed by Shi Xiu in the book, and the 'turbid air' mentioned by the Prince Yi Hong in 'Dream of the Red Chamber.' Calling it 'Acting on Behalf of Heaven,' what the Liangshan stronghold strives to protect with all its might and spends lavishly to recruit, is indeed the corpse celebrant that society desires and reveres. What the Liangshan stronghold detests and gnaws its teeth at, and cuts off its head and eats its flesh, is indeed what society desires to spit on and discard. The heart of society is the heart of Heaven. Moreover, comparing the Liangshan group with the Zhao family's government, who is wise and who is foolish between Hu Bao Yi and Emperor Daojun? The Wise Star, Little Li Guang, etc., and Grand Tutor Cai Jing and Commander-in-Chief, which is better? Collecting the fat and blood of the people for the pleasure of one or two people with the Flower Stone Gang and Birthday Tribute, and spending money like water to seek talents as if they are not enough, which is right and which is wrong, which is gain and which is loss? Gong Zizhen of Renhe said: 'If the capital is like a rat's nest, then the ramparts in the mountains are strong.' This is the phenomenon of today. Nai'an deeply lamented the autocratic government of thousands of years, but dared not speak out against it. He borrowed the story of the 108 people who disobeyed orders since the Song and Yuan Dynasties to dispel his frustrations, and then adorned it with the emblems of Sun Fu and Hu Anguo. Isn't that strange!" This is the beginning of his passage. His argument is quite similar to that of Pingzi and others on "Jin Ping Mei," and his intention in writing this article is even more blatant, clearly reflecting the anti-Manchu revolutionary thought of the time. As there were groups advocating art for art's sake at that time, there were probably also people who would stand up and say that this is political commentary, not literary criticism. Therefore, regarding "Jin Ping Mei," he also said: "Only those who are familiar with the histories of the blind and the corrupt know it. It cannot be spoken to those who sigh at the universe and lament three regrets." Writers in the Reform period, whether in novels, storytelling ballads, or other aspects, mostly reflected their ideological claims in similar ways.</p>
<p>Obstructing New Learning</p>
<p>After the Reform Movement occurred, the conflict between new and old ideas manifested as fiercely as in every era. In the forty-second chapter of Nan Tingting Chang's famous work "A Brief History of Civilization," it mentions matters related to books. It says that there was a Kang Taizun in Nanjing who strongly opposed new learning. In that year, he "saw in the Shanghai newspapers that there were still many new book titles printed, all of which were nothing but words advocating freedom and equality." He "thought that if these kinds of books were seen by young people, their natures would be seduced and corrupted, which would be terrible!" He thought: "The schools I am running now all rely on suppression and control. If they all start talking about equality and don't listen to my control, can I still hold this position? The fundamental solution now is to ban these books first. Bookstores are not allowed to sell them, and schools are not allowed to read them, so that people's hearts may be restored." Therefore, when "students in the schools were buying them, and I was buying them," and the bookstores were "too busy to handle them, making three times the profit," suddenly "a number of people wrapped in headscarves and wearing uniforms rushed in, driving away all the customers who were buying books, and searching the shelves indiscriminately. Seeing some books that they didn't like, they took them all away. It wasn't enough just to take the books away; they also dragged away the shop owners or the accountants, and took the account books with them, dragging them all to the Jiangning Prefectural Yamen." A total of two or thirty people from thirteen bookstores were dragged away. After much trouble, the "owners of all the bookstores were ordered to sign a bond stating that they would never sell such inferior books again, and that they would be severely punished if they violated this, and then they were allowed to be released on bail. All the books that had been seized were placed in the hall of the Jiangning Prefectural Yamen, where Kang Taizun personally watched as they were set on fire and completely destroyed. Then, the names of all the books were posted in the streets, permanently banning their sale. Kang Taizun was still afraid that some young students in the schools might secretly read these books, so he issued a notice, ordering all supervisors and teachers to inform the students that if they had mistakenly bought such books before, they were allowed to confess and hand in the books for destruction, so as to avoid punishment. If they did not confess, they would be severely punished, not only expelled from the school, but also severely punished." This is a very clear depiction of the conflict between new and old ideas at that time.</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch of Lanche Town</h3>
<p>— Liu Baiyu</p>
<p>—On the Taihang Mountains—</p>
<p>Da... da...</p>
<p>The sound of the donkey's hooves cut through a grove of swaying birch trees. The red glow of the setting sun hung askew in the sky. The outlines of distant and nearby mountain peaks gradually disappeared, blurring into a patch of ashen green. A mountain path cobbled with slabs of stone emerged from the woods. Faded red leaves whispered on the rocks. Cotton-ball-like mountain goats, driven by the crack... crack... of the shepherd's whip, rolled down the mountainside and vanished.</p>
<p>Jingle... jingle...</p>
<p>The faint sound of bells drifted from afar on the wind... subtle... crisp.</p>
<p>Above were cloud shadows. Below, even more densely, nothing could be seen. The sun shrank behind the mountain peaks. A few patches of red glow burned in the east. On one mountaintop... a wisp... a wisp of smoke drifted from the rooftop of a small grass hut.</p>
<p>"Is this Lanche Town the place where Confucius was stopped by a cart?"</p>
<p>"Yes... we must take a look."</p>
<p>I heard voices behind me—and again, a military song from afar—On the Taihang Mountains—</p>
<p>A line of pack animals, like a rope, wound along the mountain path into the depths of the tangled woods, their short hooves moving beneath the sparse roots of trees... black... white.</p>
<p>Rounding the mountain, a stone memorial arch stood between two giant rocks. The sky had already grown so dark that the eroded characters on the horizontal tablet could no longer be clearly seen. A long path of crushed stone, flanked by rows of thatched houses, gradually disappeared into the disordered shadows of the mountains. Looking around, the mountain peaks all lowered their heads into the twilight haze. We were standing on the cliffs of the Taihang Mountains.</p>
<p>The sudden arrival of this group of mules disrupted the quiet solitude of the deep mountain village at dusk.</p>
<p>Three rooms, as black as hell, were hunched low, crushed by the mountain rocks above. A light, the size of a soybean, illuminated the earthen pit covered with rice straw on that stone pillar. My friends and I unfolded our quilts and lay down on them.</p>
<p>On the small firewood table were placed coarse, dark, cold buns and a few bowls of steaming white water. In the shadows, there was a sound of lips smacking... smack... smack...</p>
<h3>Hater of Servility</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>When I was thirteen, I often ran to Caiqiao vegetable market to buy vegetables. Besides the dilapidated houses and uneven roads on both sides, the characteristic of the market was a long, dirty bluestone road covered with wet mud, mixed with fish scales, moldy vegetable stalks, and flat grass.</p>
<p>The people filling the vegetable market—especially the women—added a lot of sharp noise to it; and the praises of their own goods, the haggling quarrels, all mixed together to create a tiring noise, running everywhere on the road along with the people.</p>
<p>The stall in front of Mao Yuan pork shop belonged to an old man who sold green vegetables, with a pair of gray eyes. Judging from his declining face and slow movements, he was at least seventy years old. His thin body was covered with layers of tattered clothes that one could no longer tell what ethnicity they belonged to. The yellow and black wool hat on his head and the pair of soaked straw sandals on his feet seemed to solidify the old man on that small wooden stool. He lowered his head and sat motionless. If no one asked him the price, he would never look up. Often, he glanced at the women buying vegetables with an angry and disgusted look, and then answered them in a very short voice.</p>
<p>"Probably, he made his fortune by relying on this weird temper!" I often heard many women criticizing him.</p>
<p>At first, several times I haggled with him, but he ignored me and lowered his head again. But soon, I caught his temper: without talking to him too much, giving him a reasonable price in his hand, he would silently collect the copper coins, sometimes even scolding me with unclear witty words. Afterwards, I traded with him like this, and therefore became acquainted with him, often running to his house.</p>
<p>He didn't like to talk much, just said to the women in a scolding tone: "I see you won't be able to pick a satisfactory bunch in a day." Or, "People need to eat!"... Sometimes he stretched out his legs in a figure-eight shape and lowered his head to peel taro, but never looked at the vegetable baskets on his left and right sides, as if he were just a very irresponsible helper, forced to come out and guard this vegetable stall; he also seemed to be sitting alone in a secluded place, with nothing around him; in short, he was not prepared to come here to do business.</p>
<p>He lived in a small alley, in a back room filled with brown light. One side of the house was almost filled with vegetable baskets, and the other side was filled with a plank bed, a low wooden table that looked neither like a tea table nor a bean table, a yellow clay stove, and messy, broken, scattered utensils. The old man stayed in the house but was busy with chores, walking around the vegetable baskets with his legs, and often bending over sluggishly, as if that was the time when he was intimate with his goods.</p>
<p>That time I ran to his place, it was already five o'clock in the afternoon. He was sitting on a pile of small bricks, facing a stove with a pot of vegetables on it, holding a wine glass in one hand and chopsticks in the other, eating his dinner. He didn't get up to greet me, indicating that I was already an old friend of his. As usual, I walked to the vegetable baskets and started picking, turning them over from bottom to top. He got angry, made a gesture to stand up and wanted to hit me, threatening me, and pointing at me with an insulting tone, said:</p>
<p>"Useless fellow, grow up a few more years, eat ten more loads of rice, and you'll be like them! Women—it's annoying to even talk about them!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Melancholy</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Some contemporary intellectual youths often suffer from the era's melancholy syndrome.</p>
<p>Seeing the raging flames in the foreign stove licking the stove door, they shivered. They knew that they were still young, and the fire of youth was still red. They should not give up on themselves like this, crouching in the warm but damp corners of the house all day long, letting the fire of melancholy burn away their vitality. However, they were still melancholic, and life had not provided them with the necessary perseverance and courage.</p>
<p>They knew which direction the world was turning, and they also saw the dangers lying ahead on their own paths. Like those who pursue the light towards gun muzzles and prisons, they also longed for the future world. However, the bad characteristics of their bodies and the bad atmosphere they lived in limited them. They did not have the courage and perseverance to take a step forward. The internal contradictions erupted into a bitter struggle: can they only stay in the stage of projecting themselves with envious and admiring eyes onto others for a long time? Are they shortsighted materialists? Are they cowards? They cannot and dare not give themselves the answer. So, they were melancholic.</p>
<p>In the deep winter nights, they would escape outside because they could not bear the heavy oppression of melancholy, facing the biting cold wind, dragging their heavy steps in the hazy, desolate ancient road, seeking stimulation to cause a temporary morbid excitement. When they came back tired, they were still full of melancholy.</p>
<p>The life of vagrants, wine, and coffee only made the melancholy in their hearts more entangled. Every time they thought of life, of working hard, there must be a shock in their hearts, and the internal contradictions must start another fight. However, after coughing, they continued to be melancholic as before. It is very difficult to struggle on the edge of decline!</p>
<p>For these youths suffering from the era's melancholy syndrome, you cannot help but blame them, but you cannot be too harsh on them. That is a historical problem. The firm root of the era's melancholy syndrome is born of history. This root cannot be compared with the light smoke-like clouds of sorrow that dissipate easily. It can only be burned away in the furnace of history! (The End)</p>

<h3>The Ruan Lingyu Incident</h3>
<p>— Xuan Zhu</p>
<p>One year after Ai Xia's suicide, on this day of grand celebration of International Women's Day, we see the news again of China's only genius movie star Ruan Lingyu committing suicide by poisoning.</p>
<p>According to usual rumors, according to newspaper reports, and now confirmed by her suicide note, Ruan Lingyu's suicide was undoubtedly due to a lawsuit, and the origin of the lawsuit was due to marriage.</p>
<p>Before this lawsuit is over, there is no need for us to discuss it for the time being. The truth will eventually come to light. However, after reading her two suicide notes, I felt like a bone was stuck in my throat, and I had to spit it out. It is a well-known fact that Ruan Lingyu came from a humble background. Zhang Daming took advantage of that time, using petty favors to occupy her body. Perhaps there were also complex situations that we outsiders do not know. In short, it contained some feudal remnants of "repaying with one's body." However, Ruan Lingyu was enlightened (although she was still deceived in a disguised way). According to the lawyer's proof, signing a contract to terminate the cohabitation relationship, under the other party's conditions, was a "fair trade" in terms of law, conscience, and age. However, looking at the line in her suicide note, "...but he repays kindness with enmity, and repays virtue with injustice, and the outside world does not understand, and still thinks that I have let him down...", the reason for Ruan Lingyu's sacrifice is hidden in this passage. This terrible public opinion! This terrible society!</p>
<p>Born in the present era and unfortunately a woman, feeling one's own pain and seeing many events in which people struggle in contradictions without being able to find a way out, and finally end with suicide, one deeply feels how difficult it is for women to break out of a bloody path in this male society!</p>
<h3>Cremation</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tian</p>
<p>The afternoon sun gently watched over the earth, and the village was silent.</p>
<p>Li Abao, an old man who was almost fifty years old, was walking on the road in the soft sunlight. The severe cold wind of winter had disappeared without a trace. In this spring afternoon, the weather was particularly warm. But Li Abao, even though he was wearing such a thick, tattered cotton-padded jacket, still shrank his neck, shivering as if he were very cold.</p>
<p>Heavy steps were moving, and an equally heavy heart was beating. His head, which was almost numb, could no longer allow him to imagine anything. He was simply like a zombie, walking around in this silent afternoon village.</p>
<p>His dark, withered face, the wrinkles were clearly sunken one by one, his eye sockets deeply revealed two yellowish-brown pupils, his hair was scattered and fluffy, and his gray mustache, like messy grass, covered his chin messily. His slightly hunched body seemed to fall down as he walked. He walked east through West Lane, from the south of the village to the north of the village. Seeing that it was almost dusk, the sun had slipped onto the treetops of the few hundred-year-old banyan trees in the west of the village, and the golden light shone in front of his yellowish-brown pupils. The thought that he dared not think again floated to his heart, causing him to unnaturally spit out a sour foam from his stomach.</p>
<p>"Looking at this situation, I won't be able to find anything to eat today."</p>
<p>He finally thought of this thought. As soon as he thought of eating, his stomach felt even hungrier and rumbled. Since begging for two days in the town and tasting those two bowls of cold rice, it had been three days since he had eaten a grain of rice. Yesterday, he ate two very small steamed buns, but until now he hadn't eaten anything. Sour saliva welled up from his stomach and was swallowed back down. By now, his legs were so numb that it was difficult to stand.</p>
<p>"Today, the nursery in the town reportedly returned more than twenty babies, saying that it was already full. Several of them died after being returned."</p>
<p>"Hmph, adults can't survive in this age, so when children are born, they can only die and go back. Does anyone still raise them? It's cleaner to die!"</p>
<p>The conversation between two young men rushed into Ji Abao's ears, which made his heart even heavier. He was thinking, what son should poor people give birth to in this era!</p>
<p>"...Many people are committing suicide! Hanging, drowning, eating poison, and stabbing themselves with knives. Yesterday, an old man starved to death in the town..."</p>
<p>Harshly, the sharp voices of the two young men suddenly broke into Li Abao's eardrums. He felt a great pressure in his heart. He dared not listen any further, dragging his heavy, weak legs, and walked step by step towards that thatched house, the only family property that could no longer be sold. His head and body were still shivering so tightly.</p>
<p>Night unfolded its coat and covered the earth. This silent village was even more desolate. Although the sound of spring insects was not as sharp as the crazy chirping of autumn insects all night long, in this village, in Li Abao's thatched house, which was surrounded by open space and weeds, in this deep and quiet night, the sound of the insects still clearly pierced into the almost five-thousand-year-old ears of Li Abao. He closed his eyes tightly, breathing rapidly and subtly. His numb head and his heart, which had lost its heat, no longer allowed him to have the slightest feeling or imagination. His trembling hand tightly grasped a lighter, preparing to light the messy dry grass in the house when it was late at night, abandon his life, and jump into the cremation of the world.</p>
<h3>Passing Through Qutang Gorge</h3>
<p>— Ji Zi</p>
<p>Morning.</p>
<p>The gloomy sky of December wore a serious, frustrated, and bitter face.</p>
<p>On the uneven mountains on both sides of the Yangtze River, wisps of smoke rose from the rooftops of a few scattered houses. A rooster stood on the wall, stretching its neck and crowing cock-a-doodle-doo. Near the riverbank, fisherwomen knelt on the gunwales of fishing boats, washing chamber pots like dippers skimming the water. An old man squatted listlessly on the bow of the boat, yawning, spitting out smoke from his mouth from time to time. Everything was strangely quiet and still. There was no human voice, no birdsong, no ape cries, only a series of sawing sounds from afar from time to time—woodcutters on the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River steamer, speeding downstream "like smoke," passed under the feet of Baidi City. Gradually, like a seahorse stabbed by a steel needle, it lingered slowly on the water, and its pulse beat more and more fiercely. The steamer's whistle seemed to sob continuously like a dying old cow whose throat had not been pierced. White waves roared around the boat, splashing and striking the boat's hull with its white foam like guerrillas. The boat shuddered all over from the strikes. The rugged stone walls of the towering mountains on both sides of the river, agitated and shaken, seemed about to collapse. In front, the towering twelve peaks of the Wu Mountains, like nipples, trembled in the clouds. The steamer swayed, the mountains swayed, and the vegetation swayed. Everything trembled for the sake of the violent waves, and everything swayed for the sake of the surging waves. Only the wanderers seemed to have grown accustomed to the storms and the uncertain life, and their hearts were always so calm, calm as a lake of stagnant water.</p>
<p>The steamer slowly advanced along the narrow, treacherous, and dangerous river like a sheep's gut. Before long, suddenly, it seemed as if the towering mountains on both sides closed together and blocked the route, and the river flow stopped there. At this time, people without travel experience would often be surprised and anxious, staring blankly ahead, fearing that the boat would not be able to pass. But just as the road seemed to end, with a turn, a broad and vast river surface would suddenly appear. In this way, one did not know how many dead ends one would encounter, and how many turns one would have to take, before one could get out of the gorge.</p>
<p>—This symbolizes the future of wanderers!</p>
<p>I always thought so, and my lonely heart in the desolate journey often gained some comfort from this. Indeed, "where in the world is not a sheep's gut" for the future of wanderers! However, no matter how rugged and dangerous the road is, as long as you can bravely advance at risk, you can always find a straight road.</p>
<p>I walked out of the dangerous Qutang Gorge with an excited, lively, and quick heart.</p>

This handsome girl stops her footsteps. Hearing someone calling to stop her. Instruct him to quickly go up to the upstairs platform. That flower seller is carrying the basket slowly up to the high floor. A gust of wind passes, the fragrance of flowers. The tied flowers are like butterflies. The person in the boudoir is also happy to see them. Immediately picks out two or three flowers. The sizes are even, the colors are new. Looking closely at these good flowers. Of course, I ask about the price. That girl is smiling slightly. Answers lightly. Reply to Miss, I don't deceive people. This one branch. Two foreign coins. This one clip. Three hundred pennies. Should teach the buyer to welcome. Miss listens. Smiling. Saying that the price is set fairly and justly. I want to ask you how old you are this year. How many people are there at home?

<p>Zang Xibo Admonishes Duke Yin on Watching Fish (Continued)</p>
<p>Zang Xibo's admonishment to Duke Yin first uses the misfortune of improper behavior and inappropriate objects; then, it uses the principles of hunting and searching. His words are profound and clear, capable of making people fear and believe. However, they ultimately could not turn Duke Yin from his pleasure of watching fish, probably because they never tried to enlighten his heart. Duke Yin's heart was immersed in the joy of watching fish. Even if there were obvious misfortunes, he would not have time to consider them. Even if there were profound principles, he would not believe them. Xibo was unable to open his heart, and only wanted to deprive him of his joy, which was a mistake. If Xibo could truly replace the joy of watching fish with the joy of our Way, making Duke Yin's heart content, showing on his face, filling his back, and flowing through his limbs, then he would see dogs, horses, sounds, colors, pearls, jade, embroidery as being worse than dirt and gravel. Even if he were to watch the dragon swimming in the Heavenly Pool, or the carp of Dragon Gate, or those that stir up clouds and whose scales cross the sea, they would still not be enough to replace our true joy. How much less the pond water of a single ladle? I have often said that when the ruler of men indulges in feasts and travels, those who stop because they fear the words of others, merely dare not do it, but do not know that it is inappropriate. Those who stop because they believe the words of others, know that it is inappropriate, but do not know that it is insufficient. Only by being enlightened in one's heart can one know that it is insufficient. Even if advised, one will not do it. How much less those who assist him?</p>

<h3>The Salaries of Two Hollywood Child Stars: Jackie Cooper and Shirley Temple (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tiyun</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, the total weekly salaries of Hollywood's child stars is 5,410 yuan. Among them, the two highest-earning child stars are Jackie Cooper and Shirley Temple. Jackie Cooper's weekly salary is 1,350 yuan. Shirley Temple earns 100 yuan less than him, one-eighth of 10,000 yuan per week. However, if we add the allowance that Shirley Temple's mother receives, a weekly remuneration of 250 yuan for taking care of her daughter on the set every day, to Shirley's salary, Jackie Cooper is overshadowed by 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Please note, dear readers, that this is just the phenomenon in the recent recession, and it is no longer comparable to the heyday of the Golden Age ten years ago. At that time, the child star Jackie First, that is, the "Prodigy" Jackie Coogan, signed a contract with MGM to film ten films in a row. In addition to his salary, he also received a share of the profits from the productions, and MGM guaranteed a remuneration of 125,000 yuan for each film, and advanced 500,000 yuan as remuneration for four films. Filming ten films, just in terms of salary, was already 1.25 million US dollars, equivalent to more than 4 million Chinese yuan, a staggering amount. At that time, Jackie Coogan took all the money for the child stars. The other little companions received only three hundred or five hundred, totaling less than a thousand yuan.</p>
<p>However, Jackie Coogan was not the first child star in film history to earn a large salary. Before Jackie appeared on the screen, Hollywood already had a child star whose works older readers may have seen. That was the lanky child with freckles all over his nose. His name was Wesley Barry, and his nickname was "Freckles." The first to discover him was Marshall Neilan, a famous actor at the time. He saw his value and wanted to sign a long-term three-year contract with him, initially paying him a weekly salary of 75 yuan, increasing it by double each year. According to this calculation, his salary in the second year would be 150 yuan per week, and in the third year, 300 yuan per week.</p>
<p>However, Warner Bros. took the lead and snatched this "Freckles" Wesley away before Neilan's contract was signed, immediately giving him a large salary of 1,250 yuan per week. This could be considered a groundbreaking feat at the time. However, not long after, the comedian Charlie Chaplin discovered the "Prodigy" Jackie Coogan. At that time, the little prodigy was only three years old, and his salary was initially only 150 yuan per week. But since he acted in "The Kid," his star soared, and the star of "Freckles" Wesley sank.</p>
<p>The above all happened more than ten years ago. Now let's return to the two modern child stars.</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper may not earn that amount, but one of the masterminds at Paramount created Jackie's current position because his vision was too shallow. Similarly, Shirley Temple might have earned an even greater salary, comparable to Jackie Coogan ten years ago, but because one of the masterminds at Fox was too quick-witted, Shirley suffered great losses invisibly. The authorities of these two companies, one with shallow vision and one with quick-wittedness, are interesting to talk about. Let's first talk about Jackie Cooper.</p>
<p>When Jackie Cooper first performed in Hal Roach's comedy films, his weekly salary was only 100 yuan. Director Norman Taurog borrowed him to shoot Paramount's famous film "Skippy," and also gave him his original salary, 100 yuan per week. When the film was finished, Norman exclaimed with great admiration. He knew that the film would definitely be a sensation. He then screened the film in the screening room for Paramount's manager. After watching it, Norman Taurog opened his mouth and said, "If you want to sign a long-term contract with this child, I can get him over here for a price of 750 yuan per week. You know, I am the child's uncle, and I want to talk about something, I can handle it for you."</p>
<p>Norman Taurog was full of enthusiasm, but the manager, whose vision was as narrow as a bean, shook his head and said, "I don't want Jackie Cooper. I want that Bobby Coogan. He will definitely be a sensation." He was obsessed with the name "Coogan," thinking that it would become a sensation following the "Prodigy" Jackie Coogan. He couldn't see the superb performance of Jackie. Later, the authorities at MGM heard about it and immediately snatched Jackie Cooper from Hal Roach's hands. They immediately signed a long-term contract with him, with a weekly salary of 1,250 yuan.</p>
<p>The story of Shirley Temple is even longer and more bizarre. Due to space limitations, I can only briefly describe it here. In short, the stupidity, slowness, and missed opportunities of the people involved are very laughable. Just as regrettable is Paramount. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Silver Screen Surprises"</h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>The Countess of Monte Cristo – Screening at Grand Shanghai</p>
<p>The lives of countless people living under the term "extra actor" reflect everything in the entire turbulent and chaotic society. Because of the connection with the complex production process of the complex art of film, the lives of extra actors are also extremely dramatically complicated. Under the beautiful name of art, they do all kinds of inhuman things for the minimum necessary material for survival, and perform true dramas that are both moving and tearful. A writer who can relatively face this reality can write extremely profound and successful works.</p>
<p>This "Silver Screen Surprises" is a drama that unfolds from the lives of extra actors, but because the playwright's vulgar concepts and techniques are not brilliant enough, it is neither fish nor fowl.</p>
<p>Like some unsuccessful films, this "Silver Screen Surprises" suffers from the playwright's vulgarity. He lightly lets go of the lives of this group of extra actors in the dark side of the "silver screen" that he has already touched, and instead emphasizes the so-called "surprises" of yellow journalism and the soft depths of the "surprises," letting soft-hearted people be "surprised." So, he asked two beautiful female extra actors, Qina and Mimi, to sneak out in a car from the fake drama filming, and in a large hotel, impersonated the fake Countess of Monte Cristo in the play, performing a lot of unreasonable and nonsensical fake scams. Naturally, at this time, among the "surprised" group of many wealthy gentlemen, there will be no lack of a talented and amorous man who is so quirky that the plot has so-called twists and stimulation. So, a man named Rumovuski, who is said to be the great thief who has been wanted for twenty years, appeared. After staging a few old tricks of fraudulent crime and carnival dance, there was a thrilling arrest, and the woman was rescued by an old lover reporter, Shi Dan. Because of the sensation of this yellow journalism, the woman! That extra actor who walked out! Was famously used by the company as a star who could make money, and ended with a kiss with the reporter.</p>
<p>The lack of coherence in the script can be seen everywhere. The main one is that for the sake of the big reunion ending, a reporter is forced to be arranged in front as a life-saving straw when the woman commits a minor crime.</p>
<p>As for Rumovuski's appearance as a great thief who has been wanted for a long time, it is very abrupt. This is really a product of the "Jack of all trades" screenwriting method!</p>
<p>The good parts are the few paragraphs in front about the filming location. The demeanor of the big director, the several faces of the big stars and extra actors and assistants, and the atmosphere of the studio are not only realistic, but also very moving.</p>
<p>The acting skills of the heroine, Fei Lei, are commendable. Her feelings of unrequited love when she was an extra actor and her poverty and sorrow when she was trapped in a large hotel are very successful. However, her performances in social situations and in many luxurious scenes are old-fashioned and not very commendable. Paul Lukas, who plays Rumovuski, has a very good sense of the dashing and heroic spirit of a thief in a life of extravagance.</p>

<h3>Famous Films Make a Comeback: "Treasure Island" and "Chained"</h3>
<p>— Guocheng</p>
<p>These two blockbusters, "Treasure Island" and "Chained", which were valuable productions of MGM in 1934 and caused a sensation in the Shanghai film scene a few months ago, are said to be screened in this city again.</p>
<p>When these two films were first released in "Nanjing," many movie fans who were unable to see them due to crowded audiences, this is really good news for this re-screening opportunity.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about the content or plot of the film here. Based on the glorious past achievements of Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper ("Treasure Island" protagonists) and Joan Crawford and Clark Gable ("Chained" protagonists), it will never disappoint people. Especially since our film critics gave it a fair evaluation a few months ago, which is a very good proof.</p>
<p>But it would be a pity if the audience missed the chance to re-screen such films again. Even viewers who have already seen it may wish to watch it again, which is never too much.</p>
<h3>Diao Banhua "Enters" the Film World</h3>
<p>Diao Banhua has already appeared on camera in "New Woman" and received praise. Isn't it a bit slow to say she's "entering" the film world now? No, there's another reason: First, her appearance in "New Woman" was just a tryout; her role wasn't big enough to fully showcase her talents. Her genius and beauty will only be fully revealed in "Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp" and "Falling Geese on the Cold River"; Second, in those two films, she's cast as a socialite rivaling the lead actresses Ruan Lingyu and Chen Yanyan. Under the director's innovative approach, her appearances are grand and impressive, truly living up to the name "entering" the stage.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wellington (The Iron Duke) (5)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>The Duchess shooed the children away and said solemnly to Wellington, "Arthur, I'm worried. I prepared this dance party because I felt bored with your men. But what if Napoleon's troops drop from the sky?" Wellington laughed upon hearing this and said, "Oh, dear Charlotte, what are you afraid of as a respectable British Duchess? But I'm hungry. When are we eating?" The Duchess said, "We'll eat soon. I also want to introduce you to a young lady..."</p>
<p>Wellington said, "A jealous one?" He thought all women were like that. The Duchess laughed, "She's quite jealous. You don't know, she's already fallen in love with you..." Wellington said, "Not in love with me. Probably in love with my uniform." The Duchess continued, "Since you left England, haven't you corresponded with Kitty?" Wellington said, "We never correspond, we only communicate spiritually." The Duchess said, "I'm telling you, Mrs. Francis is very young and easily impulsive, plus she's a married woman. You mustn't fall for her." Wellington said, "Rest assured, I'll only hate her when I see her."</p>
<p>They then went downstairs and into the living room. Although Francis was playing the piano, her whole body was numb and cold, even her fingertips were frozen. She deliberately feigned calmness, but a young girl's attempt at calmness often backfires. She heard the door open. She saw the Duchess and a man walk in. She stood up. She felt an indescribable feeling all over her body. She remembered what she had said earlier about fainting. She understood that the person standing in front of her was the great Duke of Wellington. She heard the Duchess say, "Francis, this is the Duke of Wellington."</p>
<p>After hearing those words, she felt a wave of darkness before her eyes and immediately lost consciousness. The Duchess hurriedly stepped forward to catch her, and she fainted in her arms. Wellington was startled and quickly asked, "What happened?" The Duchess frowned and said, "I think she fainted. Quick, get the smelling salts... Hero worship... Silly girl... I told you she was too young and lacked awareness." Wellington felt flustered and said, "Fainted? That's terrible! The child has a good appearance, doesn't she?"</p>
<p>Two nights later, the Duke and Duchess of Richmond hosted a dance party at their home. Sounds of joy and laughter spread from the room into the terrifying darkness outside, like a small light from a lighthouse being seen from afar during a misty night on a stormy sea, giving people a renewed sense of hope. To the south of Brussels, not far from the city, were Napoleon's French troops. But on the smooth floors of the Duchess's residence, Wellington's officers were one by one embracing their charming partners and dancing softly, as if war and death were still thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the music stopped. The officers stood at attention. The women all bent their waists, giving the curtsy of the time. The Duke of Wellington walked in with a smile. As he walked, he waved his hand, asking everyone to continue dancing. He walked straight through the hall and into the small inner hall, where Lady Francis was sitting alone. Her heart was racing wildly. Her delicate body felt another indescribable numbness and chill. Wellington stopped, looked at her, and then bowed. He pointed to a seat beside her and said, "May I..." Francis smiled and said, "Please sit, please sit. You see, I'm braver today. I fainted the first time I saw you, I think you'll surely forgive me." (To be continued)</p>
