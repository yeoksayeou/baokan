<h3>不動產銀行之籌設</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>新貨幣政策實行時財部曾宣示設立不動產抵押放欵銀行修改不動產抵押法令藉謀巿而之活潑現財部以此項方案已經專家擬訂與各方接洽略具端倪已於日昨令行建設銀行公司尅其籌劃設立</p>
<p>按先進各國對於不動產金融之調劑俱頗重視現時不動產金融制度大致可區分為二大形態卽英美式與歐洲大陸式是也英美式以自由組織為原則純採營制其調劑不動產金融資金之任務除農業方面英美已有獨立的不動產金融組織外一般大都由諸種金融機關共同担任歐洲大陸式則係依據單行的不動產銀行法在國家監督之下設立不動產銀行為公營制或公私兼營制法國雖近於私營性質但亦同樣有其統一的組織並受國家之監督與管理日本係公私兼營制官辦而官民合資</p>
<p>我國不動產金融機構實覺毫無組織可言良以一般的金融組織尚未臻高度發展不動產金融統制當然更趨落後惟中國曾有一獨特的畸形形態農村地產僅見其受高利貸之吮吸而無若何巿塲性之作用都巿則不然尤其是上海地產其道契竟能暢行無阻長期資金巿塲中因缺乏產業證券遂使地契形成流通性最高之信用工具一九二九年至一九三一年銀價下跌時代地價暴騰造就上海地產繁榮之特殊現象其時地產主雖得享受此短期虛偽繁榮之福然中下階級所遭遇之痛苦以及加害於正當產業之深刻實無以復加</p>
<p>顧此種漫無統制之投機終由於過度之膨脹而趨爆裂之途一九三一年後地價已隨銀價之回漲及中國經濟恐慌之進展絡續下跌迨去秋美國積極實施白銀政策上海存銀外流於是地產一落千丈信用呆滯釀成不可收拾之局面</p>
<p>今次財部積極籌設不動產抵押放欵銀行自為救濟地產衰落之要策惟萬不可蹈過去之覆轍令投機之風復熾應有嚴密的統制計劃在制度方面公營制或為政府資力所不及但純委私營亦非妥善似以採取日本式之官辦而官民合營為宜至言營業不動產抵押放欵之對象本有二類一為都巿之地產一為農村之地產中國經濟基礎非盡在都巿更非上海一隅救濟農村尤為當務之急故不動產抵押放欵銀行之業務應普及於整個村掃除高利貸之剝削與强迫式之兼併</p>
<p>又不勸產抵押放欵係屬長期信用貸出資金一時不易收回故各國不動產銀行往往同時以受押地產為基礎發行債券惟中國產業落後一般產業證券異常貧乏地產證券流通後正當產業之投資必致更形减少勢將引起又一畸形之發展危險實甚吾人以為救濟地產業必須以同時救濟一般產業為前提如整個經濟機購不充實地產斷無單獨長處繁榮之理建立健全的產業證券巿塲尤為目前必要之急務也</p>
<h3>以反共為烟幕　日德商締密約　軍事互助共同防俄　倫敦政界深切注意</h3>
<p>莫斯科倫敦屆訊稱、倫敦政界對於日德雙方在柏林談判締結軍事互助恊定一節、仍極注意、談判詳情逐漸暴露、此番日德共有二約、一為軍事密約、一為對付共產國際之公開恊定、其動機均出諸希特勒、希氏明告日本、根據過去經騐、日德欲訂軍事恊定、無以保守秘密、同時報端如有關於此項恊定之消息披露、亦不便完全否認、唯此項消息、必使英國惱怒、英國將以為日本在遠東地位益加强固、故希特勒建議、為避免英方不滿、並遮掩耳目計、日德除訂軍事互助恊定而外、復公開締結反共產國際之恊定、據希氏意見、如此軟性恊定决不致引起任何人之不快、且能贏得英國及其他資本主義國家之同情焉、同時此項公開恊定、復得為軍事密約之烟幕、此項密約英國及其他國家均不知悉、另一方面、代表日本政府在柏林進行談判者為日本武官、彼於訂結反共產恊定以為烟幕一點、並不反對、唯主張先在各國預作佈置、延緩此約之公佈、直至各國反蘇聯心理重新抬頭時、始予公佈、軍事密約主要對象為蘇聯與英國、彼或將為反共產國際公開恊定之附件云、（三十日塔斯電）</p>

<p>柏林　法總理賴伐爾星期六在眾院獲勝、此間認此事足證法人深欋左翼領袖如繼任總理、則將另緊對意制裁、而增加對意戰爭之危機也、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法俄互助恊定、係於本年五月二日由賴伐爾總理兼外長與蘇聯大使波丹簽訂、惟法國國會、秘今尚未加以批准、關於此項恊定、眾義院外交委員會曾派獨立左派議員杜賚賜為報告員、加以審查、杜氏頃向「小日報」發表談話、謂「法俄互助恊定、等待國會公開討論、為時已久、勢難再延、否則俄國友人、必且以為法國與蘇聯訂立恊定之後、乃不急於加以批准矣、按法國本意、係欲訂立東歐互助公約、歡迎德國參加、惜乎該國竟予拒絕、法國乃退求其次、而與蘇聯訂立雙方恊定、然此固非法國之咎也、至於法俄恊定所載互助辦法、僅遇兩國未向他國挑　而受其侵犯之時、始生效力、故其用意非為對付任何國家明矣、當時波蘭對該恊定、原曾提出保留、但自吾人加以慰藉之後、該國已表滿意矣」云云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>墨財長游美京　與白銀問題有關</h3>

<p>關於發行日本紙幣問題、我政府暨銀錢業、均一致重視、新聲社記者昨特訪銀行公會林秘書長、據談日本旅華僑民、彼此使用日本紙幣已久、如果欲推行至使用於日本人與中國人之間、則與我國整個幣制、有莫大關係、我國人民是吾能接受、亦成爲問題云云、</p>

<h3>大陸銀行謀取消領劵契約　十三錢莊提起控訴　對該行提違背契約並給付利息之訴　被吿以政府統一發行主張廢棄契約</h3>
<p>滬上　行鈔票之銀行、爲使其鈔票暢行、流通市面、調劑金融起見、與一般無發行權之銀行及大小錢莊釘立領券契的、一方旣獲鈔票推銷之利、一方亦得業務上之便、此種契的、其期限大都爲三年或五年、領券者應照的交存發鈔銀行四成現金、作爲領券之保證、而發鈔銀行、則須給付該保證金之利息、大率以常年六厘半計算、乃自財政部於本年十一月四日實行改革幣制、</p>
<p>停使現金　以中央·中國·交通·三行之鈔票、作爲法幣後、即有某發鈔銀行乘機通函領券各行莊、欲取消前訂之領券契的、旋經各行莊集議之下、一致反對、該行嗣亦自知理由欠缺、遂自動將取消契的之議打銷、乃一波甫平、一波又起、現又有火陸銀行亦因欲取銷此種契的、致被對方起訴、緣大陸訂</p>
<p>領券之約　者、計有華豐·潤豐·震泰·長順·義生·福昌·裕中·萬茂·華通·德茂·恒茂·正康·元豐·等十三家錢莊、其所領數額、的定共一百七十五萬元、大陸給與之四成現金保證之利息、爲週年六厘半、該莊等自接大陸通知、以事關全體領券行莊之利益、曾召集全體會議、僉以其他號鈔銀行、並無此舉、大陸何能獨異、遂推代表馬文祥·劉希孟·殷煥之·等與大陸行長葉扶霄交涉、要求維持契的信用、並照的給付十三莊</p>

<p>改革幣制　欲取消所訂領券契的、停給息金、但改革幣制爲一事、領券契約爲一事、伺能因幣制改革、而影響該的之時效、况中央銀行給付被吿之息金、較被吿給付原吿者爲優、今中行旣未停付被吿所交保證金之利息、則被吿自亦不能停付原吿等之利息、事理顯然、故原吿請求判決領契約</p>
<p>繼續有效　被吿所久利息、至明日（卅一）止、應即給付、訴訟費用、歸被吿負担云云、而被吿之律師則辯稱、此次政府集中凖備、統一發行、實合於契的內「特別事故」之規定、是以被吿主張廢棄該項契的、蓋依財部命令、除中·中·交·三行外、其他有發行權之銀行新鈔固不再發行、而發出之舊鈔、亦將陸之銀行新鈔固不再發行、而發出之舊鈔、亦將陸續收回也、於是兩造律師、對於改革幣制一舉、是否即屬合同內之「特別事故」、五有申辯、庭上亦認此一問題、殊有愼重考慮之必要、遂諭雙方退候展期再訊、</p>

<h3>體育新聞　昨晚西青籃球　海賊大勝青光　協興對華東改期</h3>
<p>昨晚西青籃球、協興對東華之比賽、因改改期、海賊對青光之戰、因實力懸殊、海賊在輕描淡寫之下、以四十六比十十獲勝、另一場乙組賽滬江勝猶太、上半時八比十九、總結果三十二比二十七、</p>

<h3>國體籃球南征隊　日內來滬侯船出國　下月六七日即可在滬起程世運籃選國體恐不克參加</h3>
<p>國癢癢體專籃球隊暨國術館合組之赴南洋旅行團、一切出國手續、均已就緒、茲聞該團日內即行來滬侯船出國、昨向該團二員李震中君探得各情如下：</p>
<p>國體籃球日內來滬</p>
<p>據李震談、國體此次南遊、完全為性質、因南遊隊員均將於明夏畢業、既可作旅行參觀計、復可作技能上之探討、並可示南洋僑胞以國內籃球技術之程度、一行七人、計領隊龐玉森、隊員張長江·張長清·高長明·吳文忠·唐實堃·李震中·定一月五日前來滬、侯船放洋、至遲於六日或七日搭大來總統輪起程、因校長張之江氏、已漫遊歐陸歸來、定一月七日抵星加坡、預定在星等侯全隊到達、會同南征、該隊擬直赴星洲過港時並不逗留、預計在星加坡有四場比賽、再抵馬來亞、而爪哇檳城、最後至菲律濱、沿途比賽、將經由張校長接洽、現尚未定、定三月初旬出菲直接返滬</p>
<p>不及參加世運藍選</p>
<p>李君並謂國體此行、勢得不及參加一月底在滬舉行之世界選拔、據李表示、當初世運選拔、原定三月中舉行、迨張校長對國體南遊事宜接洽方舉、預告突然提前於一月底舉行、事實上勢將不能兼顧、但如取信僑胞起見、萬不能中止南行、現主持選拔之體協會尚無妥善補救之辦法、據本人希望、最好在一月底舉行者作為初選、而於三月內再舉行决選、遮方着想、近於偏見、想沈總幹事當有圓滿之補救方策、以上所言不過係一種個人之希冀而已、</p>

<h3>小男兒（一四〇）</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>那所小房子重景增加得很快，　不久對這份投資很為滿意，就計畫用本金去　買聞所未聞的寶物。他記錄每次存放的欵項，裴光生允許他等到她的貯蓄滿了五元的暑假他可以打蛋的代價，他眞快樂之極便跑到那穀倉裏去，取出那亮晶晶的一元四開的銀幣四枚，給乃德看。</p>
<p>乃德看了，表示不勝羨慕之態，說道：「可惜我倒沒有這一筆，不然，合着我所積蓄的三元，也差不多可以去買我久久渴望的提琴了。」</p>
<p>「也許我可以借一些給你，我還沒有決定怎樣去用我的錢，」　說道，同時丟上他的幾個銀幣，又拿手去接着它們。</p>
<p>忽然倉庫後有人喊道，「喂，孩子們，到河邊去看唐恩捉到的一條活活的大蛇。」</p>
<p>「來罷，」　說道：於是隨手將錢丟入一個老簸穀機裏，他就一溜烟跑去，後面跟着乃德。</p>

<h3>專載　中國之製茶事業（四）　衣白</h3>
<p>贛省焙製　綠茶除振植公司用機器外，其餘均用手工，其方法大致與皖浙相彷彿。贛　茶振植有限公司為中國有數之製茶工廠。設立於民國四年，資本規元十三萬兩，在修水城東泰鄉，自備茶園二千五百九十五畝。揉茶之機械最初使用者為日本製造之（Jacprons　Rapid　Roller）式揉捻機九部，嗣以不良，由英國購備印度式揉茶機四部。惟焙茶器具，尚襲用舊法之焙範。</p>
<p>（福建）福建產茶甚豐，所產盛銷於南洋一帶，但因台灣白茶之輸入潮汕等埠，侵奪華茶在南洋之市場，年來，節節減少。福建之製茶法均為手工舊式，與贛皖浙相同。</p>
<p>（湘鄂）兩湖產茶之家，甲於全國。以前每年輸出，不下四十餘萬箱。近因湘鄂兩屬產茶之區半為共匪盤略；又因銀根吃緊，外銷不振，以致茶業一落千丈。在民國十七年，漢口華茶輸出達六十一萬擔，但至十九年，落至三十一萬擔。漢口有磚茶工廠四，俄商居其三，華商居其一，後以俄商工廠因蘇俄日茶傾銷與蘇聯限制華茶，故在　十一年停業一家，盤出一家。華商與商業磚廠為中國磚茶工廠中之皎皎者。創立於清光緒三十二年資本額五十萬元。出品有米磚茶，紅磚茶、青磚茶等。其質較為精良。惜在一九三二年大水災時期曾一度被淹。致遭甚大之打擊。後雖復原，又值中日事變，經濟恐慌，故至今尚在危殆中。</p>
<p>（江蘇）蘇茶年來受日茶競爭之打擊，一落千丈。據調查報告，全省茶廠共有八十五家。但資本最大者僅一萬五千元，且僅十四家。規模甚小，且均在手工業方式下生產。（各省茶情均據實業部經濟年鑒）</p>
<p>由此而觀，中國茶　應不能與世界新興產茶國所競爭。例如中國製茶機尚需求之於後進產茶國之日本與印度。已無上之落伍。再加連此項向後進國購買之機器其　微乎其微，此實更為中國茶不能發展之最大證實。此種情形，猶如古北口中日戰爭時，中國以十八世紀之大刀與日本二十世紀之飛機坦克相戰，結果中國自屬不利。</p>
<p>五　華茶產銷改良計劃之芻議</p>
<p>華茶雖被世界新興產茶國競爭而淪於絕境；然而在茶之數量上來看，中國在目前仍為世界產茶國中之王國。據日本改造社出版之經濟學辭典關於茶業項載：一九二八年世界茶生產總額四百七十萬一千噸中，中國實佔其六　％七之三百萬噸。復據中國銀行經濟研究室調查：中國茶年產額為七百九十萬市擔，按以一九三三年世界各產茶國（中國除外）之生產總額四，０九０，四九五公担折合八百十八萬０九百九十市担，而中國之產額實佔世界產額百分之四十九強。中國既有此巨量之茶生產量，如果再將其質加以科學之改良，以及將其運銷之機構使之健全，則中國茶決無沒落之理。茲分述如後：</p>
<p>第一，關於茶業本身上急需改良者</p>
<p>甲，植茶山場應予以改良</p>
<p>中國農民，往往保守，據本年九月十四日時事新報載：「杭州龍井一帶——茶產地面積約百餘畝，每年產量　百餘担。——最近發現尺蠖，為害至烈，迭經捕殺無效，龍井所有茶樹上之青葉，皆為食盡，僅存枯枝擎天，一如火後，日蔓延至速，附近如翁家山楊家山等地全被殃及，蟲災面積延　一千畝左右，來年生產絕望。」此種情形，實為植茶者忽略科學管理所致。復據上海茶葉公會致全國經濟委員會函，中關於「改良生產」項中，略謂修水縣及或　茶之生產　至極，　年最盛時期，年產十八萬箱，但至今不滿萬箱，蓋茶地因外銷不振而任其蕪荒所致。目前急應救濟。其救濟之法：鬆土耘草，補種施肥。例如每年秋季時，於植茶山場，挖鬆泥土，芟除野草，略施肥料，如葉枯豆餅等類。年齡過老之茶樹，剷除之，而另補新種。至於蟲災，則可施以不傷害茶樹之藥物驅減之。</p>
<p>乙，製茶技術應近代工業化</p>
<p>華茶生產在目前尚部脫手工業，此實為二十世紀所不宜有之現象。華茶因多賴太陽光曝曬，以致時有日光之臭味。即非科學之鐵鍋烘焙，亦難得良佳之茶味。如華茶之一切生產工具均易以近代機器，則茶葉水分之吸收可得一定之限度，茶葉之色味可得一定之保留，根本無有發酵過度或色味不勻之現象發生。觀乎印度日本錫蘭等茶葉所以能獲得市場者，其故均在茶葉生產近代工業化。最宜避免者為華茶經營之商人重視近利，忘却永久之利益。例如茶葉與茶梗相混，以及茶中染人造之色，或以水潑入茶葉中。關於含水潮茶最近實業部已明令取締，凡毛茶含水超出百分之四十五以上者，一律禁止買賣。但關於此點最好務望茶商本身覺悟。蓋此無異飛蛾之見火以為光明，實則自殺也。中國茶質因地　關係，冠於全世界，此點已如前述。故中國茶目前仍能銷往印度日本等產茶國，實因此等產茶國上品之茶尚需混以中國茶也。中國製茶業者如果能以遠大眼光而大規模的普遍的施行近代工業化，則華茶之前途實仍有無限之光明。（未完）</p>

<h3>吃在上海</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>上　　所以在上海　各式各種的口味，都齊備的，現在就以菜館來說一說。</p>
<p>熱帶式的，有印度飯店，寒帶式的，有俄國飯店。東方式的御料理，歐美式的白色大菜，應有盡有。</p>
<p>至於本國的菜馆，益發多了。北京，天津，南京，鎮江，福建，杭州，蘇幫，揚幫，一時也數不清許多，而尤其是所在皆是的，是廣東菜館，徽館，　波帮和無錫帮，以及本地飯店。此外還有清眞教門館，還有佛教化的素菜館等等。有人說，有錢人，才能上這些菜館吃。這話不錯。但是贩夫走卒，却也有一快朵頤的所在，因爲在上海，在貧民窟裏，每一條街上，總也有幾家小飯店，出售廉價的菜餚的。就是再說得經濟些，乞丐們花上二三個子兒，也有美味可嘗的。不過他們所嘗的，不是整盌的菜，而是大館子裏的残羹冷飯，拚　而成的罷了。</p>
<h3>松江四鳃鱸</h3>
<p>— 甲辰生</p>
<p>光陰流水般的過去，一轉眼間，又是仲冬季　了，在這天寒地凛。瑞雪初飛的時候，那著名的松江四鰓鱸，又成應時的食品，宴樂嘉寶的珍物。</p>
<p>松江的鱸魚，本來並沒有什麼特別的異昧，不過因爲經過詩人的吟詠，以致流傳到如今。</p>
<p>松江產生鱸魚的區域，雖不止一處，但是，鱸魚却有三鰓四鳃之別，以四鳃者爲貴，產於松城秀野橋下一泓清水之內，產量至少，其他各處產量雖多，却都是三鳃。</p>
<p>鱸魚初上市的時候，四鰓售一元一斤有齐，三鳝者可得二斤至三斤不等，最便宜時一元四斤。</p>
<p>在松江城內　家館子　吃鱸魚一品鍋，價目沒有广定，要看吃的人多少，譬一如四個人吃，每人雨尾，配以其他食品三四，如鷄片肉片冬筍等，初上市約一元六角，久之則爲一元二角了。</p>
<p>家中宴會，如需用鱸魚，須一二日前至魚肆預定，否則屆時不能應用，因四鳃鱸只秀野橋下一處出產，每天是供不應求的。</p>
<p>鱸魚出水　死，共性有如　魚，因此之故，携帶到別處頗不容易，此或　爲珍贵原因之一，若京滬滬杭間，有火車交通，可以朝發午至，亦頗多專足來購者，携帶之法，必须將魚置於糠皮内，始能保其新鮮而不至變味。</p>
<p>鱸魚之味，端在鮮嫩，故其食法，必須生食如食野雞肉一般，而主要烹調，尤非雞湯冬荀等品佐之不可。</p>
<p>滬上的浦東，也產鱸魚，而且產量極夥，但係三鳃之類，市上目爲常物，價亦平賤，實則鮮嫩比松江之鱸，有過無不及，嗜鮮者也大可一試呢。</p>

<h3>東山白羊肉</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>又是羊肉上市的季節了，每條街上：小茶館跟麵館子的門前，都有着一條羊担停歇着。綠色的乾荷葉裹邊概着白片的肉，切上三四百文，上麪館子來一碗光麵，上小茶館來上五十文老麥燒，擱起了脚喝一口酒手指兒挾片肉怪悠閑地邊吃邊跟人們談閑天，在這時節上街不來上這一下似乎不算閣氣的。</p>
<p>第二十二回俠語動脂唇　姝　議　虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>周太太道：朱女士，你若是不敢回家去，我倒有個辦法。你就搬到樓上去，住在藍夫人隔壁屋子裹。無論如何，你不要出來。他不和我們要人，我们還要他交代出一句話來。他若是來找我們，那就很好。我們要把他推出這旅館去，方才了事。你只管躲開，天倒下来了，還有屋頭頂着呢，你還怕什麼？月英靠了一根廳柱立着，手上掏起一隻衣襟角，放到嘴　去咬着。低了頭，望了自己的脚尖，正在沉吟着這個問題。劉太太將他的身子推了一把道：你這人怎麼這樣過分胆小，有我們這許多人帮你的忙，你還怕什麼？你住在藍夫人隔壁，他來找你，先就找着藍夫人，藍夫人可以把他打發回去的。青天白日，朗朗乾坤，誰也不能把人活吃下去，你就是讓他找着了，他又能把你怎麼樣？你這個孩子，自己得想開一點。那姓贾的有什麼本領，你不見我們剛才拿茶壺　他，他拚命的逃走。劉太太說話時，牽了他的手，交給藍夹人手上，藍夫人帶了他，笑嘻嘻的就上樓去在樓梯上低聲向他笑道：誰知道昨晚上嗚嗚咽咽哭着的就是你。你這分委屈，實在是够人忍受的，那也難怪你要哭了。他携了他的手絮絮叨叨的走上了樓去。這却把樓下旁觀的王北海看出了神。兩手按了桌子，半抬了身子，站不站，坐不坐的，只管向樓口上望着。直等月英走進了房去，他才囘過頭來，這一下子，却看到贾多才正了面孔，搖搖擺擺，由外面進来。他在前進屏門的地方，似乎想到了什麼事情，站了一站。後來看到在過廳　那一　女太大，都擁到客廳　面去了，他却認爲是一個機會，立刻向自己　子　奔了去。站在一邊的王北海看到，還就不由得哈哈大笑一聲，呌起來道：來晚了，来晚了。贾多才聽到身後有了這種奇怪的言語，就回頭向北海看着。北海也扳了臉，對着一個過路的茶房道：照看公道說話，到那　去，這條路都是通的。這句話分明是對贾多才說的，多少是有點挑戰的意味了。（三八六）</p>
<p>十　　鼻子會聞　　　　　的味兒，假使　　　　　呢。</p>
<p>羊肉　入的總地點，在大水　南邊的一個村莊　做吳家　，村裏幾十戶都是靠着羊　活的，除了冬季　　東山　羊的莊戶剪羊毛，冬季裏就挑羊肉担了。　則他們的過活都靠之於羊，養羊的却极少，這幾天每天全村裹要殺掉幾十頭大綿羊，都來自浙江省的南　跟太湖南各江口的羊販子，一船銷掉跟着一船又開到村裹來了。</p>
<p>每條羊肉担一冬可做三四百塊錢，生意會如此大，却大在可欠賬，要是你天天上街的，他們就給你記賬，所以有的戶頭到年底算算賬有十來塊錢，　戶頭到討賬時甚至不上街躱羊肉債，所以到大除夕那天有着討羊肉賬剝衣裳跟　大門的把戲。</p>
<p>挑羊肉是最辛苦的，白天殺，晚上頭雞啼就出担了，最遠的要過蝦　嶺到白沙，北頭。像到我們後山的經過干山嶺，塘手嶺而抵楊灣村，爬山過嶺挑着重担子要經過這末崎嶇的山嶺跟不少村莊呢。</p>
<p>據說他們燒羊肉的方法使火聽了很奇怪的；祇用一竈稻草柴燒着燜在鍋子裏，到頭雞啼把骨出去，肉移置到担盤裏就挑着出了。</p>

<p>我們的故鄉—常州，可以說是一些出產都沒有；從前馳　全國的蓖箕木梳，因爲製造者的墨守陳法，故步自封的關係，更兼之近年來婦女们都把主干煩惱絲付之井州一剪，這蓖箕木梳不如從前的需要，所以也一天天的衰敗下來了。</p>
<p>但是也有一樣不爲人所注意的食品—糟扣肉，現在却頗爲一般人所贊賞，本地人固然喜歡它，別處人吃了之後，也會念念不忘的讚不絕口；每值　歷新年，更是家家戶戶所必備的美餚。聽說在上海今年已經有人製了出售，可是因爲宣傳的不得法，曉得的人還不多。記者現在特把它的製法寫在下面，以爲吃了再想吃而不知它怎樣製法的外鄉人告。</p>
<p>向肉店裏買了塊五花肉，切成四英寸正方，入釜加醬油和酒（少許，用以解腥。）煮熟，取出，候冷再切成二英分薄之肉片，在肉皮上涂以醬油店所出售之颜色少許，（意在色澤紅潤，不涂亦可。）肉皮向下，裝入粗飯碗內，然後蓋以陳酒糟，（槽坊有售，在糟廳用前，應先在鍋中略砂，並去其硬塊，再加糖及醬油等作料。）在糟上加生薑一片，葱結一個，隔水蒸四五次便可。食時另傾於菜碗中，於是肉在上，糟在下矣</p>
<p>糟扣肉的製法並不難，所化也不算貴，以一元的代價，可製成五六碗。他的妙處在於肥而不腻，氣味香厚，而且爛得和荳腐一般，就是平時不吃肥肉的人，也可以吃上一兩塊。</p>
<h3>平民化的滋養品</h3>
<p>時序轉到了冬天，很平民化的滋養品的成爲，又一般人的補補身　物；除了備做家常的佐膳菜饉如蒲包蛋，燉蛋，蛋餃，蛋皮，　　蛋以外，每天早上把一二個鷄蛋來打入米燒粥裏調食和攪拌白糖服用，都有相當滋補身體的功能。</p>
<p>可是除了上面之食法以外，再有用人工培植的方法，並且一經培植，其滋補的效力更大；備　鷄蛋和紅　葡各五六十枚。每個鷄蛋分實於每個紅　葡中，在「冬至」的那一天，把他分別埋在泥土裏，（須個個　埋）等到脊分日　一挖出，每天用開水冲服一二枚，有補精益體的功效。</p>
<h3>廣東三蛇會</h3>
<p>— 卓</p>
<p>時履隆冬，也是廣東人吃三蛇會的季節了。北四川路的廣東館子宰了大蛇便把蛇皮張掛在玻璃窗樻裏做招牌，無數的行人每天探著頭兒向裏面　張望，在此時此地可知道是怎　　的事情了。我今年來每年總吃上三四次的蛇，所以頗知其中味道，這介紹人的責任，是義不容辭的。</p>
<p>吃蛇起于何時？經過如何？原因何在？恕我沒有　歷史癖　，不能清楚地考證出来。在我只因爲貪吃，便跟着人家吃了，那時還在十多年前，在我們的老家……廣東。所謂三蛇蛇，便是名爲　金脚带．過樹榕。犯指頭」的三種蛇，爲什麼要把這三種蛇合弄起來吃，我也莫名其妙，其實也不一定把這三種蛇配合起來才好吃，因爲它們的味兒根本沒有什麽不同。至於要這樣對於身體才有　益，那未免帶點玄學的意味了。</p>
<p>蛇的烹調方法，照我吃蛇的經騐，老是一個樣子。就是把蛇宰了，去了皮，失把肉和皮放到鍋子裏煮熟，然後把它拿起來，就一絲絲地像拆鳝絲般拆爲肉條，皮也一絲絲地切爲細條，（有些弄法是不要皮的，我以爲皮混在肉絲裏却別有風味，因爲皮熟了就卷縮着，像吃田螺肉一樣的爽脆）再和上果子狸，鷂，鲍魚，冬菇，豬舌頭，　　等切成或拆成的細絲，混在一起放到鍋子裏，連湯熬兩三個鐘頭，便可以吃了。蛇肉本來就很鮮甜，再加上這許多肉類及素菜，所以吃超来益覺鮮美濃郁，爽滑可口了。因爲有道許多東西混在一起，蛇的眞味反覺不容易辨别出來，就是蛇的肉絲，也須細心認識，才可以看出；我想這一鍋子肉羹，就算没有蛇肉在内，也很不錯的了。據說蛇的胆汁對於人體最有補益，（確否待考）所以宰蛇的時候首先小心地把它的胆囊提了出來，然後把胆汁放到酒裏混成一片，這叫做　蛇胆酒．　喝起來有點凉味兒，怪有趣的。</p>
<p>據說蛇的鱗和骨有毒，吃錯了不是好玩的，所以拆蛇肉的時候，要揀得非常精細。大約這　工夫也不甚難的，我們從來也沒聽見過因爲這個原因出了事．又據老於吃蛇的人說，吃了蛇之後是不可有男女之事的，否則所養得的孩子會長出像蛇鳞般的皮膚。所以每當吃蛇的時候，總會聽到這樣的話語：　今天夜裏要規矩些，當心養出帶着蛇鳞的小孩子来，　這句話是否迷信，因為沒有得到實騐的報告，不得而知。不過這件事於醉饱之後總不相宜，前辈先生的用意或者在此吧。</p>

<h3>一年的總結算</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>一九三五年又將成爲歷史上的一頁了，在這里我且把這一年中世界和中國發生的幾件大事列出來，作爲今年的總結算。</p>
<p>今年最是震動世界的，便是東菲戰事了。在這次戰事的發展中，一方侵略者大肆其鯨吞弱小的野心，他方被壓迫者堅持其反抗强權的毅力。另一方面，英法則實行對意制裁於先，主張拍賣阿國於後。目前兩國戰事尙在相持中，今後意阿問題的解决，恐非任何和平方案所能爲力了。</p>
<p>其次現時正在倫敦開會中的海軍會議，也是値得一提的。這個會議的舉行，原是聊盡人事而已，很少有成功的希望。蓋英美日的海軍競爭，已日趨尖銳化，妥洽誠非易事。但這個會議的成功或失敗，關係於遠東問題，很爲重大。作為遠東問題中心的中國，實有加以充分注意的必要。</p>
<p>說到我國，在這一年中，外力的壓迫，更足以加重我們的困難。冀東二十二縣，已爲漢奸所控制，冀察二省，也形成變相的自治區域。最近內蒙有宣吿獨立之謠，沽源也有失守的消息。凡這種種，都可以斷送國家的元氣。故今後我國救亡圖存的工作，非賴全國人民合力担負，恐無挽回國運的一天了。</p>
<p>總觀上面所述，一九三五年的世界，是强者加緊佔奪殖民地的時期。這種現象，本爲帝國主義發展的結果。現下一九三五年就要結束了，跟着而來的，便是危機的一九三六年，世界大局的前途，將進入歷史的一大時代。在這個時代中，列强的鐵蹄，必然耍更無所顧忌的向外伸展，以遂其割宰弱小的願望。別的且不說，太平洋的形勢，或有掀起巨浪的可能。那末我國今年雖能支持過去，應付未來的大難，其困苦當百倍於今日了。</p>
<h3>瘋人</h3>
<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>滿了十歲的阿强從田野里挑着畚箕和一些雜草歸來的時候，小小的心頭里湧動着無數的可怕的影子，並不是自己的親生的爸爸的瘋在的時候的兇暴，咬着他的好像田野的泥士似的牙齒，黃黑色而積疊着無數的皺紋的臉孔，每當他跳起來的時候的一種異樣的强烈的痙攣，飢餓慣了的深凹着的眼睛透出了可怕的殘暴的光芒，那高鬆着的肩頭和微駝的背是從南洋的鑛坑帶回來的，就好像早就消失了他的生命的活力似的，可是，當他瘋了的時候他會振作起來把他的妻和阿强拼了命地摔打着的，就好像一匹受傷了的怒馬，沒有目的地向着阻擋了他的一切人物衝突着。</p>
<p>阿强剛回到自己的古舊的家門。躡手攝脚地踏着，實在，這小孩子的心在可怕地跳着的，他害怕碰見了瘋了爸爸。可是，就在這個時候，他的媽媽却在房子里發出了嗚鳴嘩嘩的悲哀的哭聲，阿强的心里跳了一跳，他不敢跑了進去，他的心里知道這又是爸爸的瘋了的把戲。可是這個時候？從房子里透出來的打罵的聲音：</p>
<p>「媽個×，你敢罵我，哼！我要殺死你，你是什麼東西，你是一匹沒有用的蠢豬，……哼！我要殺死你！看你敢罵我……」</p>
<p>爸爸的怒吼着的聲音，跟着，他聽到那很有勁的腿「　」的一聲。媽媽掙扎起來，嘩啦嘩啦地哭了，她痛苦地哀嗚着：</p>
<p>「你殺死我吧，我不做人了，我捱苦也捱够了，天呵！你這沒有良心的鬼，來到你家十四年了，你到南洋去了四五年回來，就這樣瘋了嗎？你裝瘋的呀！你，你這害人精，你會做夢把家里的田賣光了，你不想耕田，就給那鬼女人騙你到南洋去，四五年一轉回家，就變了瘋狗，天天回家討錢，誰有錢養你這鬼子，還兇狼到這個樣子，天殺你，電打你，你沒有好死！」</p>
<p>阿强膽怯地跑進屋里的時候，他從廊上望進黝黑的房子里，吊滿了眼淚的臉上，樵悴的可憐的樣子，長長的頭髮給爸爸扯散了而且蓬亂得很，她已沒生氣似的靠着古舊的結婚時候的大床的柱子，喘着氣的在嚕囌個不停的。她瞪着她的丈夫，他正在咬緊了牙根的，撐着腰，氣憤憤地準備要打過去似的，可是，當她罵完了的時候，他却猙獰地哈哈大笑起來：</p>
<p>「你這不要臉醜婦，你還敢吵？你知道五年前媽媽死了，才賣了田地做喪事，還了一點債，到了沒有辦法的時候，才去做了那一些人憎恨的××的勾當，，才認識了伊，伊是女人，是有才學的女人，那像你這樣的一個不懂事的蠢豬？蠢豬呵！你知道，我那時是爲了性命才逃到南洋去做苦工，在鑛坑里躱了四年多，一個銅錢都歛不到，而且還受那些鬼子的鞭笞，唉，你看，我的背，駝子呀，你看我的肩，高聳了起來呀！這就是……」這時，他忽然瘋狂了似的哈笑了起來，，揮着手，跳了起了，又咬緊了牙根，怒吼着：「所以，你就不愛我了嗎？你這不要臉的醜婦，你也學人家一樣自由戀愛呵！不！你偸了漢子，你偷了漢子才敢這樣罵我，你，我到南洋去了四五年，你就養了一個十歲的雜種：阿强這野仔，不是你……」</p>
<p>他狂瘋了的握緊了拳頭，跳到她的臉前吃喝着：</p>
<p>「給我滾出去，這是我的屋，這是我的家，去，去，我現在什麼都不要，總之算是世界拋棄了我吧，我沒有工作，南洋，家鄕，都沒有工作給我做，但是，我要喝酒，我要我的自由，但是你却不給錢我，叫我去死嗎？你昨天挑磚不是得到兩三角錢嗎？你拿到那里去？快說！」</p>
<p>她發怒了的站起來，她想逃走，可是，他一手就揪着地，就好像要咬一口的推着搖着，她又嘩啦的哭了起來，她撲到他的懷抱里也瘋了似的衝擊着，兩個子都拼了命的扭打着；可是，他是比較有力的，他用力的抱着她的頸。他一邊在找着菜刀，一邊嚷着：</p>
<p>「我要用力來斬死你，斬死你，你這……」</p>
<p>阿强看見這樣子，嚇得一跳的跑出了，恐怖地叫着：</p>
<p>「救命呀！爸爸要用刀殺死了媽媽呀！救救命呀！……」</p>
<p>一會兒，幾個鄰居跑到他們的屋里來的時侯，房里已寂靜的。他和她却相偎着的喘着氣的，而且互相掉着淚的，就像沒有瘋過一樣的痛苦地在流淚了……。</p>

<h3>牛墟</h3>
<p>— 士希</p>
<p>朝陽爬上鷄冠嶺的峯尖，吐着恬靜而又柔和的長舌尖，輕輕的舐在鎭上那高聳的，單瘦的土堡上。嚝塲上已開始擠滿了人，而牛墟也就開始了。農民們用着顫抖的高聲，　喝着牛羣，通過結凍的村子，通過枯荒的草原，而終於嬾嬾的踏進鎭上這凄凉而又齷齪的大街。</p>
<p>大街是充滿了寂寞和陰冷的，而牛據便建在靠東的盡頭。所謂墟的，是一個荒曠的塲所，四周編織着一些頹坍的籬笆，籬笆上這時嫩嫩的掛着幾縷溫煦的陽光。而在陽光下，便像牛糞也似的擠滿着一堆堆黑色的人羣，他們手裏擎着旱烟筒，高聲而且憤慨地在談論着收成，市價和捐稅。把這空虛而又靜寂的牛墟，塞滿了烟氣，喊叫和嘷鳴。</p>
<p>是十點鐘。正是上市的時候。墟代理人同時又是牙人（註一）的添福叔。這時也突然地不知從什麽地方飛進來，而顯現在人羣之前了。他是一個「好笑神」的肥胖的中年人，有一個令人可厭的紅鼻子，祇要他底紅鼻子在人們底眼里一愰，無論在千軍萬馬中，誰也會認識他：這是添福叔的紅鼻子。他用着非常豁達的步伐，踏將過來，面上浮動着柔和的笑，而一大羣的買主則默默的，跟在他底屁股後，遍遊每個角落。他會爲着他底神聖的職務而去拍遍了牛們底屁股，扭住鼻子，攀開嘴巴數着牠們底牙齒多少，這樣他們便會看出這些牛們底年齡和價値。</p>
<p>買至們爲着他們底策略，對于對方是從不敢露過滿意的。每當代理人添福叔拍完了一頭牛底屁股，或數過了一遍牙齒後，而用着探詢的口吻，說：「您着這條怎樣？」</p>
<p>他們總還是表示不滿意，或者故意搖搖頭，而心裏却在暗暗想道，「這到不錯！」可是沒過一個鍾茶工夫，他們便又會用漠然的態度說道：「要什麽價目？」</p>
<p>添福叔便溫和地笑着，又向牛主人招招手。牛主人便從人堆里跑過來，滿面燜着光。添福叔於是又拍拍牛屁股，快活的恭賀道：「黃四哥，這回總算要使你開頭市了！」</p>
<p>叫黃四哥的便客氣地蠢笑着，直直站住，邊却在暗中估量對方是吾眞有誠意要和自己成交這筆交易。對方露着漠然的態度，向他簡短地問了一些關于這頭牛的生活，習慣和勞動能力後，便提到價目問題來了。</p>
<p>牛主人除了替自己底賀色吹一陣牛。比方是：」嚇，你看它是瘦瘦的條牛兒，曾一天趕過五十藍粟田哩！」故意把價錢抬高了點。買主于是皺了皺眉便淡然的走了，有意或無意地去拍另一隻牛底屁股。添福叔這時要嚇的連紅鼻子也變靑，慌慌張張的跟過去：「怎樣？」</p>
<p>買主於是便搖搖頭，憤憤的叫道「見鬼！這是一頭什麽貨色？値那麽大價錢！」</p>
<p>「那你？」</p>
<p>「這個！」買主伸出了他底指頭，在陽光下這麽輕輕地一愰，便又走開了。</p>
<p>添福叔要憤憤的，把牛主人埋怨着，又指明那頭牛已經老得快只有拖進中灶（註二）去，又探好了實價，跑去找要主，這樣經過了好些時間的奔跑和折衝，終於貨色成了交，添福叔便以袋裏掏出條紅布條，結在牛底　頭上，表示它巳有了新主，而牛主人和買主便滿面堆着笑，相得着上鎭去痛飲三杯，這是成例的「交關」酒。添福叔，得到了他底應份的若干代價後，也就走開去做他另一筆生意。</p>
<p>當太陽移過正中，得不到新主的牛羣，又被從鎭上大聲叫喊着趕開，通過了荒漠的草原，望那結凍的村子前進。</p>
<p>牛墟的本柵門被關緊了，而鎭上復又充滿了枯寂和空虛，只有那寒冷的西北風，在單瘦的士堡上呼呼的吼着。</p>
<p>註一：牙人卽公人的意思。</p>
<p>註二：牛灶是南方的方言，意卽宰牛廠。</p>

<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「新春」</p>
<p>梅開廋嶺報初春。綽的豐姿別帶顰。但只見。裙屐連翩携手去。尋芳鬬艷色新新。高標紅綠顏如玉。素淡濃裝國色身。騷客爭評喧冶艷。詞人描寫賦詩勤。當年王謝堂前燕。此日尋常到處巡。香雪已盛春海上。冰魂玉骨翠帷塵。舞烟柳葉深深處。淡月寒雲確可珍。疏影籬笆高士隱。一爐香炷裊輕勻。枝橫假石相爲友。不待風吹香自臻。無言淡泊偏宜月。冷落寒宵儘有神。三分不讓春光雪。一段香餘冬景辰。又只見。笙歌徹夜人喧語。却原來。大地春回鑼鼓振。影遲紅杏艷陽轉。所以是。到處迎春樂意申。亂鴉爭樹聲聲噪。巳只爲。麗日和風景色頻。　果旭日晴飛燕。淡淡塞烟歇浦濱。歸家去。細味今宵初報春。</p>
<p>杜文奎周劍虹大紅袍</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）午夜十二時一刻至一時</p>
<p>開篇「春情」</p>
<p>春畫紅樓鸚鵡鳴。曲欄杆外倚娉婷。慧心兒轉動雙眸定。紅雲桃腮想出神。自知貞靜幽閒女。看西廂每每學雙文。想思債與風流僓。香消玉碎始還淸。否則萬死不饒</p>

<p>人。曾記得園中初相會。天生的。俊俏面龐薄嘴唇。被他縛住奴芳心。頓然忘却　門訓。蘭房藏匿爾小郎君。可稱。無邊光景一時新。有時節。交腿坐。有時節。並肩行。有時節同盃合　共談心。有時奴把香烟吸。他把。剩的殘烟腹內呑。難盡難描一種情。有時。奴向妝台臨寶鏡。他與奴。重整烏云揰鳳箏。弄粉調脂件件精。好比年少周郎善用兵。居然退娘子軍。若要離一刻作別片時辰。九轉三迴不忍分。蝴蝶戀花花戀蝶。君須憐奴奴憐君。若然半月無音信。便是迥紋織錦成。眞個君心抵妾心。</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>巴黎除夕開映兩巨片</h3>
<p>霞飛路巴黎大戲院，除夕晚十一時一刻起特別加映一塲，選定為「全部五彩卡通」片及「基度山恩仇記」二片同時開映，樓上下價目二角四角，基度山一片，因此次開映時連日擁擠，專為抱向隅者之最後機會起見，逾格選入，因該片卽將運往外埠云。</p>
<h3>大光明映「小霸王」</h3>
<p>詹姆士賈克奈的最新傑作「小霸王」Frisco　Kid，是一部緊張激烈的武俠熱情鉅片。在賈克奈最近主演的數部片子中，當以本片為最佳，而助演人員如瑪格蘭琳姍，李卡度考坦及麗蓮黛嬭泰等，又都是傑出的人才，因此更為本片生色不少。片中不但有銀幕上罕見的劇烈的戰鬥，且焚毀賊區一幕，火光燭天，尤為驚心動魄，現聞該片已定於今日（除夕）日夜在在光明公映云。左為該片一幕。</p>
<h3>談「凱歌」的意識</h3>
<p>在水災旱災相繼而來的現在，在高呼着剷除封建餘孽的當兒，「凱歌」給了大家一個很警惕的暗示。</p>
<p>它雖然僅以旱災為背景，實欲揭示整個所謂「天災」的原因與解救的眞正辦法。我們可以看到封建餘孽怎樣靠着劣紳的操縱而蔓延，我們更看到紳士是怎樣利用愚昧的農民在救災的假面具之下發起了迎神賽會從中漁利，而有清醒思想的人又是怎樣被他們目為叛逆，有好的方法不能施行，由此使我們知道，土豪劣紳和封建勢力的相互利用形成了災荒益加嚴重的局面災荒的好名義玩着的假仁假義的把戲。</p>
<p>導演卜萬蒼先生嚴肅地處理了這個嚴肅的題材，他用老練的拔巧把握住這完善的內容而充分地發揮，使印入人們心靈的深處，他以紛亂的羣眾塲面來緊張劇情以及最後所造由於「大眾一心」而打通了江水的頂點，都是値得注意的手法。</p>
<p>現時此片已定元旦日在金城獻映，我們珍重地而又很有把握地向全國仕女介紹！</p>
<h3>明星近聞拾零</h3>
<p>「刧後桃花」花園佈景，連日為風雨所毀，該佈景計有二十四塲戲之多，天晴即修補再拍</p>
<p>王微信在「情書」中，為一軍人，王近定製呢軍服一套，皮長靴一雙，聞耗資頗鉅。</p>
<p>吳村日前與兩隻老蟲合拍小照一幀，老蟲臺良不畏，表情自然，亦奇事也。（該照將發表「明星半月刋」新處號中。）</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan and Others Returned to Beiping Yesterday. Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying Visited Tada. Continued Talks on the Jidong Incident. Song's New Year's Day Military Parade. Feng Zhi'an Appointed as Commander-in-Chief. Candidates for Various Departments of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters Have Been Determined Internally.</h3>
<p>Tianjin. Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Pan Yugui, Lin Shuyan, and Liu Jialuan, the chief of staff of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, left Tianjin for Beiping at 4 PM on the 30th. It was decided to hold a military parade at Xiyuan on New Year's Day and to host diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Beiping on the 4th. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Early on the 30th, Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying visited Commander Tada and Chief of Staff Nagami, as well as Major Imai, the military attache of the Japanese embassy in Beiping, at Commander's residence Zhang Garden in the Japanese concession, to discuss the Jidong Incident in detail, regarding the new militia newly formed by the puppet Jidong government as troops, advancing towards the Xinhe, Tanggu, and Tongzhou areas, and approaching the suburbs of Tianjin. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping tonight, accompanied by Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Pan Yugui, and others. After Song and others got off the train, they went to his private residence in Yiku to rest. Xiao Zhenying stated that the rumors that he had gone to Changchun were absolutely untrue. There was no need for any secrets in Hebei-Chahar diplomacy. They had met with various parties in Tianjin every day, and there was factual evidence to support this, which did not need to be disputed. Regarding the Chahar issue, the Japanese side only requested the stationing of the Mongolian Security Force, and there would be no changes to the administrative system. The Japanese side hoped that we would send personnel to negotiate on the spot, which was currently under consideration. It was reported that Li Shouxin's troops and the Mongolian Security Force were now between Guyuan and Zhangbei. The Jidong Incident, with Yin Rugeng changing the situation, had no impact on the future of negotiations. Tada had already sent Chief of Staff Nagami to Changchun to negotiate. After Doihara went to Changchun, there was no news from Beiping or Tianjin. Song decided to go to Baoding on the 4th or 5th of next month to take office as the chairman of Hebei concurrently. The date of the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters would have to wait until after he took office as the chairman of Hebei. The Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters would still be established in Beiping and Tianjin in the future. The rumors of Mongolian independence were probably untrue. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Wang Shijiu, the secretary-general of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, said that Song Zheyuan planned to go to Baoding on the 5th to take office as the chairman of Hebei Province. The Tianjin-Tanggu Security Command had been completely disbanded. It was undecided what kind of agency would be established instead, and it would have to wait for the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters to decide. The negotiations on the Jidong Incident in Tianjin had yielded a rough outline, but had not yet reached a resolution. Shen Chang and Zhang Jingli, the representatives from the Ministry of Railways in the north, had met with Song and the negotiations were satisfactory. (30th Dispatch) It was confirmed that the issue of the east of Chahar, Tanggu, and Jidong would be resolved.</p>

Song sent Liu Jialuan to temporarily act as the security commander, Shang Weiqian as the acting chief of the general affairs section, and Ding Lansheng as the acting director of the army prison. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing. According to diplomatic sources, Sino-Japanese relations had deviated from the norm for more than four years since the September 18th Incident. The complicated disputes were indescribable. The reason was that every time an incident occurred, it was only dealt with temporarily, and a fundamental solution was not sought, which was not a blessing for both countries. Now that the atmosphere was gradually improving, the central government had taken this opportunity to make an overall adjustment to Sino-Japanese relations through diplomatic channels, so that the relations between the two countries could be improved and put on the right track. At present, the two sides were exchanging preliminary views, and seemed to have agreed in principle. As for specific issues, they have not yet been discussed. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

After the meeting, Zou said that there were no important proposals at this regular meeting, and the reorganization of the two agencies was also not true.

<h3>Yang Yongtai Returned to Wuhan.</h3>

They then took a special vehicle to Sanbei Wharf to land. Yang first went to the Garrison Headquarters to visit He Chengjun, and issued a written statement at the Garrison Headquarters.

(3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Anqing. Yang Yongtai passed through Anhui on the Yong Sui warship on the evening of the 29th. Liu Zhenhua boarded the ship to meet and talk. Yang then continued to go to Hankou on the original ship, while Liu took the Anfeng special ship to Wuhu and then to southern Anhui for inspection. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou. Yang Yongtai issued a statement, roughly divided into several points. The policy guidelines cannot be predetermined. The biggest difficulty at present is that after the banditry, there has been a flood. We should concentrate our efforts on repairing dikes and using labor as relief to temporarily save the victims. Regarding the feelings of the student movement, I believe that reading and saving the country should not be neglected, but the movement must have a clear goal, a clear boundary, and adhere to the scope. These are the three major prerequisites. This decision is the student movement to oppose the autonomy falsely claimed in North China. The goal is very correct, but our leaders' patriotism is definitely no lower than anyone else's. We firmly believe that there will be appropriate arrangements and should be a strong support, not blindly following the chaos. The central government's foreign policy has been clearly decided at the Fifth Plenary Session. It is to embrace the determination of the final sacrifice and to make the greatest effort for peace. We should adhere to the central government's intentions and treat it with the purest and most friendly attitude, so that diplomatic relations can be more harmonious. (30th Dispatch)</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a speech on "Construction is impossible without learning, and the meaning of people being able to fulfill their talents." The ceremony ended at 10:30 AM. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Lin reported at the National Government's Memorial Week on the morning of the 30th. The main idea of ​​the original speech was to carefully study the words of the Prime Minister in his speech at Lingnan University, "Construction is impossible without learning," and the words in his book to Li Hongzhang in the late Qing Dynasty, "People can fulfill their talents," believing that they were interrelated, saying that China was an ancient civilized country with four thousand years of history and was not short of outstanding talents, but when it came to construction undertakings, it was not difficult to compete with the great powers. The reason was that we did not use our learning to the fullest, nor did we use our talents to the fullest. This was something that we should study. The following four points should be paid attention to: Although education in our country has not been popularized, it has made significant progress. However, the curriculum in middle schools is complicated and difficult, and there is still concern that it will waste students' mental energy, which is still the focus of debate in the education sector. As for how specialized disciplines should adapt to actual needs, this is also a problem today. In ancient times, officials were appointed based on their abilities and were assigned different jobs. The current government's use of people takes the talent-based approach and has tried to correct the mistakes of the past. However, given the vastness of China, the number of institutions, the rapid changes in trends, and the many environments, it is not easy to say that people can fulfill their talents. There are thousands of things to be done in the future of construction, which cannot be accomplished by one person alone. Talents and those who use talents both have unlimited responsibilities. The Prime Minister said that construction is impossible without learning, which was said to students. The state uses huge educational expenses to cultivate young people, and the purpose is to enable them to become talents and contribute to the country and society. Moreover, at this time of national crisis, the better the construction, the greater the need for talents. Without real learning, how can we come out and do something? The ancients said that being down-to-earth everywhere is a genius, because the deeper the knowledge, the more diligent the heart, and there must be real skills to be useful to the world. If the temperament is vain and boastful, how can one save oneself? Therefore, the only way for young people to save the country is to strengthen their abilities and bury themselves in hard work. One day of preparation is one day of achievement. Since construction undertakings are so complicated, the government has the responsibility to lead and the society also has the responsibility to promote. Talented people in civilized countries each perform their functions and do not have to gather in institutions, nor do they have to sink into the wilderness, because there are many needs for talents in all aspects of development, so it is easier to find a way out. My country's backward production, economic poverty, and talent unemployment have become important issues today. The government should vigorously reward and search widely, and the powerful figures in the society should also enthusiastically develop industries and work together to achieve success, so that the supply and demand of talents will correspond and unemployment can be reduced. In summary, whether it is political construction or economic construction, people with knowledge and skills are indispensable to shoulder the heavy responsibility. Only by cultivating their talents in the pursuit of knowledge, and valuing their learning in the pursuit of talents, can both sides promote each other, devote their efforts, save the country and survive, and achieve their goals. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Vice Chairman Chiang reported at the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week on the 30th, mainly saying that revolutionary party members bear the responsibility of leading the people, and there should be an unchanging way for them to conduct themselves. The theories of governing the country and pacifying the world left by the ancient Chinese sages and sages are revolutionary theories. For example, the chapter of the Great Learning was long admired by the Prime Minister. The so-called "manifesting the clear virtue, loving the people, and stopping at the highest good" is actually the criterion that revolutionary party members should abide by. The so-called "things have roots and branches, and events have beginnings and ends. Knowing what comes first and what comes later is close to the way" is actually the only way to handle affairs. We must understand this truth and practice it, and then we can lead the people, and then we can complete the revolutionary task. Otherwise, even if we have courage and are willing to sacrifice, we will inevitably work in vain. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The General Headquarters held the Eighth Memorial Week at 8 AM on the morning of the 30th. Chen Zhenxian, the director of the Second Department, led the ceremony and reported briefly that the year 24 would become a historical relic. He hoped that all staff members would review the past and work hard in the future to be loyal to the nation and the country. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Newly Appointed Chief of Staff, Cheng Qian, Was Sworn into Office. The Central Government Sent Li Liejun to Supervise the Oath-Taking.</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The newly appointed Chief of Staff, Cheng Qian, completed the oath-taking ceremony at the Government after the National Government's Memorial Week on the morning of the 30th. The central government sent Li Liejun to supervise the oath-taking, and the heads of various departments and committees attended the ceremony. After taking their seats, music was played, and Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Then, the seal授印ceremony was held, followed by the oath-taking ceremony. After the ceremony, Li Liejun gave instructions, saying that this decision was made by the new government organization, and the central government selected the wise and capable, and the people at home and abroad were eagerly anticipating it, especially paying attention to the senior military personnel. Originally, the Chinese nation loved peace and also believed in the League of Nations Charter and the Nine-Power Treaty, and all countries would definitely abide by them together, so they did not pay much attention to military affairs. Since the European War, all the great powers have expanded their military preparations and strived for perfection. Under the contention of such powers, if we want to build a country, sufficient force is not enough to maintain the integrity of the territory and maintain world peace. My country's science is backward and its economy is depleted, so its military preparations have not been able to keep pace with the great powers. Moreover, because it has always loved peace, in recent years, its territory has been invaded day by day and it has been oppressed from time to time, and the national crisis has increased. Although there are also advocates of justice in the world, they have not been able to help. From this point of view, the General Staff Headquarters has the responsibility of national defense, which is even more important. Comrade Cheng Qian followed the late Prime Minister in the revolution and served in important military positions for many years. He was appointed as the Chief of Staff, and it would be easy to seek the improvement of the staff service, and he would definitely be able to plan for the best in terms of national defense equipment, in order to live up to the government's reliance. The colleagues in the central government hoped that Comrade Cheng would encourage himself and continue. After Chairman Lin's instructions, he briefly stated that in recent years, the country has been suffering from natural disasters, man-made disasters, and foreign troubles. The government has not had much power to do military and national defense, and at the same time, the national economy has also felt very lacking, but a country should have adequate preparations for itself in the world, even if the environment is not good. Modern military and national defense must rely on profound knowledge. In recent years, the government has devoted itself to suppressing the communists. Thanks to Chairman Chiang's dedicated planning, it has now come to an end. In the future, we should prepare as early as possible to prevent foreign aggression. Comrade Cheng has worked hard and loyally for the party and the country. This decision to be appointed as the Chief of Staff is deeply celebrated as a victory for the country. It is hoped that Comrade Cheng will work harder in difficult and arduous circumstances in order to live up to the expectations of the Central Committee and the people of the whole country. Chairman Lin also wished Comrade Cheng good health. Finally, Cheng Qian gave a reply, saying that he could not help but feel terrified on the day he received the Chief of Staff's life order. He estimated that his knowledge was shallow and he was deeply afraid that he would not be able to take on this important task. However, the national crisis was imminent, and as a party member and a member of the military, he should do his best to do his part. In addition, with the instructions and encouragements of the Military Committee Chairman and comrades, he had an unshirkable duty. He had already received instructions from the Chairman on the 23rd and had gone to the Ministry to start his duties. After today's swearing-in ceremony, he had received instructions from the Central Oath-Taking Committee and the Chairman, and he would sincerely accept and engrave them in his heart. After taking office, he would follow the guidance of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Commission, and supervise the staff of the Ministry, step up their efforts to work, in order to improve the staff business and live up to the expectations of the Central Committee.

Champagne was served, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. On the 31st, Mr. Musses and others hosted a banquet for the Provincial Government representatives at No. 94 Kuling. At 10:00 AM on New Year's Day, the Provincial Government representatives will unlock the premises and officially take over. A luncheon will be held at the Kuling Company to entertain Mr. Musses and the directors. The handover of documents will take place on the 2nd, and land matters will continue to be processed (Central News Agency dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<p>Nanjing: The new agreement for the Kuling British Concession was signed on the 30th, comprising fourteen articles with very fair content. Back in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign (1885), a British missionary named Kidd, admiring the scenery of Lushan, purchased public land in the Niuling Changjie area from unscrupulous people to build roads and repair bridges. Local gentry discovered this and filed complaints, which, after ten years of negotiations, led to the establishment of the concession. In the thirtieth year of the Guangxu reign (1904), an expansion of the concession land was agreed upon, and company buildings were erected to exercise administrative powers. Fifteen years later, the Revolutionary Army descended the Yangtze River and recovered part of the police authority. In the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), the Lushan Administration was reorganized, and construction boomed. With harmonious relations between Chinese and foreigners, the Westerners expressed their willingness to return the concession, leading to today's outcome (Central News Agency dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<h3>Special District Court; Agreement Extended for Three Years; No Notification Six Months Before Expiry; Newspaper Report of Our Intention to Abolish is Untrue</h3>
<p>Nanjing: A Shanghai-based Japanese newspaper reported that the Chinese side hoped to abolish the Special District Court agreement, which is due to expire in the spring of next year. It claimed that the Chinese side was publicizing its unwillingness to extend the agreement and that the judicial authorities were studying measures to be taken after its abolition. According to reliable sources, this statement is completely untrue. The current agreement expires at the end of March of the 25th year of the Republic (1936). If China intends to revise or abolish it, notification should be given six months in advance. Our side has not given any notification before October 1st of this year, so the agreement will naturally be extended for three years (Special dispatch from the 30th).</p>

<h3>The Establishment of a Real Estate Bank</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>When the new monetary policy was implemented, the Ministry of Finance announced the establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank and the revision of real estate mortgage laws to revitalize the market. The Ministry of Finance now states that this plan has been drafted by experts and negotiated with various parties, and has already instructed the Construction Bank Corporation to plan its establishment.</p>
<p>Advanced countries have always placed great emphasis on the regulation of real estate finance. The current real estate finance system can be roughly divided into two major forms: the Anglo-American style and the Continental European style. The Anglo-American style is based on the principle of free organization and adopts a purely commercial system. The task of regulating real estate finance is generally undertaken jointly by various financial institutions, except in the agricultural sector, where the UK and the US have independent real estate financial organizations. The Continental European style is based on a separate real estate bank law, establishing real estate banks under state supervision as public or public-private joint ventures. Although France is close to a private system, it also has a unified organization and is subject to state supervision and management. Japan is a public-private joint venture, managed by the government with joint public and private investment.</p>
<p>China's real estate financial institutions are truly disorganized. Since general financial organizations have not yet reached a high level of development, real estate financial regulation is naturally even more backward. However, China once had a unique and distorted form: rural real estate was only subjected to high-interest loans, with no market function whatsoever. The situation in cities was different, especially in Shanghai, where land deeds could circulate freely without restriction. The lack of industrial securities in the long-term capital market led to land deeds becoming the most liquid credit instrument. The sharp rise in land prices during the silver price decline from 1929 to 1931 created a special phenomenon of prosperity in Shanghai real estate. Although landlords were able to enjoy the benefits of this short-term false prosperity, the suffering experienced by the middle and lower classes and the profound damage to legitimate industries were beyond measure.</p>
<p>However, this kind of uncontrolled speculation ultimately led to excessive expansion and a burst. After 1931, land prices continued to fall with the rebound of silver prices and the progress of the Chinese economic crisis. When the United States actively implemented its silver policy last autumn, silver flowed out of Shanghai, causing land prices to plummet and credit to stagnate, leading to an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's active planning to establish a real estate mortgage loan bank is a key strategy to rescue the declining real estate market. However, it must not repeat the mistakes of the past and revive the speculative trend. There should be a strict regulatory plan. In terms of system, a public system may be beyond the government's financial capacity, but purely private operation is also not appropriate. It seems best to adopt the Japanese model of government management with joint public and private operation. In terms of business, there are two types of real estate mortgage loans: urban real estate and rural real estate. China's economic foundation is not entirely in cities, let alone in Shanghai. Rescuing the countryside is particularly important. Therefore, the business of the real estate mortgage loan bank should be extended to the entire countryside, eliminating the exploitation of high-interest loans and forced mergers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, real estate mortgage loans are long-term credit loans, and the funds lent are not easy to recover in a short period of time. Therefore, real estate banks in various countries often issue bonds based on the mortgaged real estate. However, China's industry is backward and industrial securities are extremely scarce. After the circulation of real estate securities, investment in legitimate industries will inevitably be further reduced, which will lead to another distorted and dangerous development. We believe that rescuing the real estate industry must be based on simultaneously rescuing general industries. If the entire economic mechanism is not sound, the real estate industry will have no chance of long-term prosperity on its own. Establishing a sound industrial securities market is the most urgent task at present.</p>
<h3>Using Anti-Communism as a Smoke Screen; Japan and Germany Conclude Secret Agreement; Military Mutual Assistance and Joint Defense Against Russia; London Political Circles Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>Moscow, London dispatch: London political circles are still paying close attention to the conclusion of a military mutual assistance agreement between Japan and Germany in Berlin. Details of the negotiations are gradually being revealed. This time, Japan and Germany have two agreements, one is a secret military agreement, and the other is a public agreement to deal with the Communist International. Both were initiated by Hitler, who told Japan that, based on past experience, it would be impossible to keep a military agreement between Japan and Germany secret. At the same time, if news about this agreement were to be disclosed in the press, it would not be convenient to deny it completely. However, this news would anger Britain, which would believe that Japan's position in the Far East was becoming more consolidated. Therefore, Hitler suggested that, in order to avoid British dissatisfaction and cover up the truth, Japan and Germany should not only conclude a secret military mutual assistance agreement, but also publicly conclude an agreement against the Communist International. According to Hitler, such a soft agreement would not cause displeasure to anyone and would win the sympathy of Britain and other capitalist countries. At the same time, this public agreement could serve as a smokescreen for the secret military agreement, which Britain and other countries would not know about. On the other hand, the Japanese military officer representing the Japanese government in Berlin did not object to the idea of using the anti-communist agreement as a smokescreen, but argued that arrangements should be made in advance in various countries to delay the publication of the agreement until anti-Soviet sentiment in various countries resurfaced. The military secret agreement is mainly aimed at the Soviet Union and Britain and may become an annex to the public anti-communist agreement (TASS dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<h3>US Student Federation Resolves to Oppose Any War; Urges National Support for China and Abyssinia in Resisting Foreign Aggression; Condemns Joint Anti-Russian Plans by Japan and Germany</h3>
<p>Columbus, Ohio, USA: The US Student Federation resolved today that it would not assist in any future war, but at the same time called on students across the country to support China and Abyssinia in resisting foreign aggression. The Student Federation is currently holding its annual meeting at Ohio State University, accepting the oath of students from Oxford University, declaring, "We refuse to assist in any war in which the United States participates." This resolution was passed unanimously, and it also stated, "For the sake of world peace and the interests of the United States, we call on American students to support the people of China and Abyssinia in their struggle for freedom," and "We hereby call on American students to condemn the anti-Soviet plans of Japan and Germany," etc. (Guomin News dispatch from the 29th).</p>
<h3>Laval's Declaration; Berlin Expresses Goodwill; Sees Franco-Soviet Agreement as a Thorn in Their Side; Says it Hinders Franco-German Understanding</h3>
<p>Berlin: French Prime Minister Laval made a declaration in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, explaining the country's foreign policy. One passage concerned Franco-German relations, stating, "If France and Germany cannot cooperate with each other one day, then European peace cannot be guaranteed one day. I believe that France and Germany should not form an agreement independently, but should form an agreement within a collective European organization." Most newspapers here have commented on or praised it. The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" stated, "Laval has made explanations on various international issues, and the passage concerning Franco-German relations is particularly skillfully worded." The newspaper believes that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact (concluded in May this year) is a thorn in the side of Franco-German understanding. Laval has made good arguments about the importance of this treaty in order to reassure people (Havas dispatch from the 29th).</p>
<p>Berlin: The victory of French Prime Minister Laval in the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday is seen here as proof that the French are deeply concerned that if a left-wing leader succeeds as Prime Minister, he will tighten sanctions against Italy and increase the risk of war with Italy (Guomin News dispatch from the 29th).</p>
<p>Paris: The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact was signed on May 2 this year by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador Potemkin, but the French Parliament has not yet approved it. Regarding this treaty, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has appointed independent left-wing member Mr. Dulais as the rapporteur to review it. Mr. Dulais recently gave an interview to "Le Petit Journal," saying, "The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact has been waiting for a public discussion in Parliament for a long time, and it is difficult to delay it any longer, otherwise our Russian friends will definitely think that France is not in a hurry to approve the agreement after concluding it with the Soviet Union. According to France's original intention, it wanted to conclude an East European Mutual Assistance Pact and welcome Germany to participate, but unfortunately that country refused. France then sought a second option and concluded a bilateral agreement with the Soviet Union, but this is not France's fault. As for the mutual assistance measures contained in the Franco-Soviet agreement, they will only take effect when the two countries are invaded without provoking other countries. Therefore, its intention is definitely not to target any country. At that time, Poland had reservations about the agreement, but after we reassured them, the country expressed its satisfaction," etc. (Havas dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<h3>French WWI General Dupont Passes Away</h3>
<p>Paris: General Dupont, a famous figure in the French army during World War I, passed away today. Mr. Dupont served as the director of the French military intelligence department and later as the French High Commissioner in Danzig (Reuters dispatch from the 29th).</p>
<h3>Soviet-Uruguayan Diplomatic Break; Correspondence Released; Russia Denies Aiding Communist Agitation</h3>
<p>Moscow: Uruguay and the Soviet Union have broken off diplomatic relations. The correspondence between the Uruguayan Foreign Minister and the Soviet Ambassador to Uruguay, Mr. Minkin, has been released here. In his note, Mr. Minkin stated that the Soviet government had previously fully explained that the Soviet government had no connection with the Communist International and was not responsible for the actions of the Communist International. As for the Uruguayan authorities' claim that the Soviet Embassy instigated communist parties in neighboring countries and provided assistance, Mr. Minkin said that this was a completely unfounded reason. The Uruguayan side cited the "frank words" of the Brazilian government and the speeches at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, but there was no real evidence in the Uruguayan note, which was, of course, because there was no such evidence in fact. The facts they cited were completely inaccurate. "The Soviet Embassy in Uruguay has never provided direct or indirect assistance to the Communist Party or any political party in South America, and has never provided material assistance to other countries (including Brazil). I now strongly reject these accusations. I must point out that this is a complete fabrication. I must solemnly declare that the Soviet Embassy in Uruguay has only carried out the work prescribed and permitted by international law. The Soviet Embassy has never interfered in Uruguay's internal affairs and has never participated in disputes between various parties and factions in Uruguay and other countries in the Americas. Our government has not predetermined future work. I now firmly protest these accusations against our government. In my capacity as the head of the embassy, I firmly reject the above-mentioned accusations," he said (TASS dispatch from the 29th).</p>
<h3>Suma Returns to Nagasaki; Will Take Train to Tokyo; To Report on Political Situation in China</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Consul-General Suma in Nanjing, in order to report on the political situation in China, took the Nisshin Shipping Line "Rakuyo Maru" from Nanjing on the 27th and arrived in Shanghai on the 28th. He then consulted with Ambassador Arima at the Japanese Embassy to finalize the content of the report to be submitted to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. He then took the "Nagasaki Maru" from Shanghai yesterday and arrived in Nagasaki this morning. He will transfer to the 2:45 PM train from Nagasaki to Tokyo. After arriving in Tokyo, Suma will immediately visit Hirota to report in detail on the trends in China's political circles after the establishment of the Ji-Cha Political Council, the course of China's student movement, and the situation after China's monetary reform. He plans to return to his post in three weeks (Hualian News dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Dispatches Yasukawa to Inspect South Seas Economy; To Depart in Late January</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of economic affairs in the South Seas, will dispatch Mr. Yasukawa Yunosuke, the former Senior Managing Director of Mitsui &amp; Co., to visit the Dutch East Indies and Thailand, with the same significance as the dispatch of a special envoy to Brazil in the past. He will inspect economic affairs and at the same time enhance national goodwill. He is scheduled to depart in late January for a period of six months. Mr. Yasukawa has already agreed to this. Before his departure, Yasukawa will liaise with the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and will also meet with the Siamese Interior Minister Mr. Puranji Matan, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo today (Dentsu News dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<p>Tokyo: Otani Kozui, who has been vociferously proclaiming Japan's mission in the Orient for more than 30 years and has continuously traveled the world, departed from Yokohama today aboard the "Yokohama Maru" for the South Seas to study the future of South Seas industries and to investigate the South Seas mandated territories of the Mariana Islands and Caroline Islands and their adjacent waters. He will return home at the end of February (Dentsu News dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<h3>Mexican Finance Minister Visits Washington; Related to Silver Issue</h3>
<p>Mexico City: Finance Minister Suárez suddenly departed for the United States. On the surface, this trip is for a honeymoon, but in reality, it may not be. Key members of the Ministry of Finance only learned of Mr. Suárez's departure when he was about to leave. It is likely that after arriving in Washington, Mr. Suárez will discuss the general situation of the silver issue with the US Treasury authorities. However, it can be asserted that this trip is not because he feels uneasy about the future of the silver market. As far as Mexico is concerned, as long as silver maintains a market price of about 50 US cents per ounce, the country's silver mining industry can still expect to make a profit. The Mexican government previously deposited 7 million US dollars in a New York bank as collateral for Mexico's debt to the United States. It is generally believed that when Mr. Suárez holds talks with the US government, he will use Mexico's assistance in the US silver policy as an exchange condition for a satisfactory resolution of the country's debt to the United States (Havas dispatch from the 29th).</p>
<p>London: The Financial Times today carried a dispatch from Washington stating that people in Washington believe that the visit of Mexican Finance Minister Suárez to Washington must be related to the US change in its silver purchasing policy. The US change in policy is likely to give priority to purchasing silver from Latin American countries that have concluded or may conclude reciprocal trade agreements. However, this kind of restrictive measure will cause open conflict between the government and the congressional representatives of the silver-producing states. Mr. Suárez will meet with US government officials tomorrow, and will hold a secret meeting with important members of the silver faction on Wednesday (Reuters dispatch from the 30th).</p>
<h3>Predictions for 1936; Serious Incident to Occur on Russian-Manchurian Border; Gloom Envelops All of Europe, but War Will Not Occur; War in East Africa Soon to End; Mussolini Uncomfortable in His Position, Increase in Assassinations, World Economy Increasingly Panicked</h3>
<p>Paris: French famous seer and prophetess Madame Fraya etc., Today once again made its annual predictions to the Associated Press, saying that Mussolini could not maintain his supreme authority and would be overthrown or defeated next year, Roosevelt would have to win or be re-elected through struggle, or a new figure would ascend the stage, and former President Hoover had no hope. War panic would envelop the whole of Europe throughout the year, but war would not necessarily occur. There will be many disturbances in the Far East, there will be riots in India, and there will be serious incidents on the Russian-Manchurian border. 1936 is the influence of Saturn and Neptune, and Mars is also connected, so there will be many assassinations and deaths. Bank failures, exchange fraud, increased suffering of the people on the mainland in winter, sudden births and ends of love affairs, and increase in mental illness are all things that should happen. As for France, the current government may not last, but Laval himself may not care, because he has been working hard for a long time, and he would be happy to take a rest. France's democratic system will remain unchanged, and Anglo-French relations may be tense from time to time, but the two countries will maintain friendly relations. France, because of its strong defense and strong military power, will not fear any enemy, and will definitely be victorious. Although the clouds of war are spreading, war will not break out. The Italian-Ethiopian war will end soon, because Mussolini wants to get out of it as soon as he gets a little face. Mussolini's power is declining day by day, and Italy's economy will become more and more difficult in the future, and it will be more difficult to be supported by the people. However, Italy has not yet reached the stage of democracy, so even if Mussolini is gone, the successor will still be a dictator, or slightly more lenient. There will be assassinations in Italy, and Mussolini may not escape. There will also be political disturbances and assassinations in Greece, and General Kondylis should be a little wary. There may be a shocking murder case in Austria. The Habsburg dynasty may be restored, but it is difficult to last. The United Kingdom and the United States will be the most prosperous countries, and there will be great progress next year. The United States has gradually become conservative due to its prosperity and recovery. If President Roosevelt does not see this, there will be big problems in the general election. The banking industry in the United States may restore the old habits and have various malpractices. There will be revolutions in Central and South American countries, and South America will be quieter, but there may be coups in Argentina (Guomin, 29th).</p>

<h3>Attempt to Recover Lost Northern Territory: Abyssinian Army Prepares a Large-Scale Counteroffensive; King Will Personally Oversee the Front Lines from Taissy City; Abyssinian Troops Skillfully Avoid Bombardment, Rendering Italian Air Force's Power Ineffective</h3>
<p>Rumors circulating in the Abyssinian capital (Akyab) for some time indicate that the Abyssinian army's counteroffensive, aimed at recovering lost territory along the northern front lines, will commence today. Today marks the end of the Abyssinian Christians' fast and the celebration of the Gabriel Feast. King Abyssinia's preparations to travel from Taissy to the northern front are steadily progressing. Abyssinian military headquarters in various locations are extremely active. Unofficial sources suggest that several dozen Italian aircraft are conducting reconnaissance in the Danbian area today. General Nasibu, commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian army in Wogga Aden, is confident about the outcome of the major battle, at least as far as the northern front is concerned. Collins, Reuters' chief correspondent in Abyssinia, spent a week embedded with General Nasibu's forces and met with him in an old two-story house in the village of Gajah, located on a plain, which serves as his headquarters. The army under General Nasibu's command numbers approximately 75,000 men, mostly wearing yellow uniforms, as white ones are easily targeted by aircraft. The soldiers' diet is very simple, consisting of only a quarter of a pound of barley rice soaked in salt water per day, yet they remain remarkably strong. Initially, the Italian army advanced but subsequently retreated. The current front lines appear largely unchanged since the beginning of the war. Both sides claim to occupy the three locations of Gerlogubi, Gorahai, and Walwal. However, based on the situation, it is estimated that an area of approximately eighty miles has become a "no man's land." Walwal, however, seems to still be occupied by Italian sentries. The Italian army's strategy primarily relies on aerial attacks, which initially had a significant psychological impact. At one point, General Nasibu's troops were almost demoralized due to fear. However, after two Italian aircraft were shot down, attacking aircraft dared not fly below three thousand feet from the ground to avoid being hit by rifles, making their bombs inaccurate. Furthermore, the Abyssinian army is now adept at camouflage and has dug bunkers to avoid bombs, thus treating aerial attacks as routine and remaining calm. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from our correspondent Oschinat in Akyab, military experts here believe that after occupying the Danbian area of Adigrat, the Abyssinian army will soon advance toward Magal, Axum, and Aduwa. The strategic situation on the front lines has completely changed in the past week. In the preceding two months, the Italian army made successive advances in the Tigray province, advancing rapidly without encountering significant resistance. Now, the Abyssinian army is putting up strong resistance, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides, possibly exceeding those of the previous two months. A major battle may be imminent. The Abyssinian army's plan seems to be to encircle Magal City, where the Italian front lines are most exposed and vulnerable to Abyssinian exploitation. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from our correspondent Oschinat in Akyab, fierce fighting is ongoing on the northern front. Italian and Abyssinian forces are frequently engaged in hand-to-hand combat. While the Italian air force wants to inflict heavy damage by dropping bombs, they are hesitant due to the risk of harming their own troops. Instead, they are resorting to machine-gun strafing, hoping to repel the enemy in a more economical and reliable manner. The Abyssinian troops have become accustomed to aerial bombardment. Upon hearing the approaching sound of aircraft, they quickly seek shelter in the forests, leaving the Italian aircraft helpless. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Imminent Rainy Season Hinders Enemy Advance; Abyssinian Guerrilla Tactics Prove Effective</h3>
<p>According to reports from Akyab, Abyssinian guerrilla forces are disrupting the Italian army's lines of communication on the northern front, hindering their continued advance before the rainy season. The so-called "short rainy season" will begin in a few weeks. Aides to the Abyssinian Emperor told the Associated Press today that General Getachew, the Minister of War's main force, may not advance further. Rumors circulating that General Getachew's troops have engaged in fierce fighting with the Italian army are a misinterpretation of the Emperor's telegram on Saturday announcing the Abyssinian victory at Adigrat. General Getachew's troops are currently stationed between Korem and Amba Alagi. Abyssinian guerrilla tactics have proven effective. The Italian army has now abandoned its attack on Amba Alagi. There have been many scattered skirmishes in the past few days, but few major battles. The main forces of the two armies have not yet made contact. (Kuo Min dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Italian Army Uses Poison Gas Shells; Abyssinian Government Protests to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>According to reports from Akyab, the Abyssinian government today lodged a protest with the League of Nations, accusing Italian aircraft of indiscriminately using gas bombs in the Adigrat battlefield on the northern front, in violation of the Gas Protocol. The number of Abyssinians who have died from these poison gas shells is currently unknown. The Italian use of gas bombs has provoked the Abyssinian tribes.</p>
<p>Aerial Bombardment Kills Innocent Civilians</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from our correspondent Oschinat in Akyab, four Italian aircraft flew to the town of Dagap on the Wogga Aden area of the southern front and bombed it indiscriminately this morning, killing many civilians. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Libyan Garrison Transferred to East Africa</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Daily Telegraph correspondent in Port Said, Egypt, the Italian steamship "Calabria" recently sailed through the Suez Canal from Benghazi, a port in the Italian colony of Libya, carrying a batch of Libyan troops to Massawa, a port in the Italian colony of Eritrea. It seems that Italy has withdrawn a portion of its garrison in Libya, but the reporter did not specify how many troops were withdrawn. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Holds Meeting; Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation in East Africa; Paris Proposals Fail to Satisfy</h3>
<p>According to reports from Rome, Mussolini announced at a cabinet meeting today that the Paris peace proposals fall far short of Italy's minimum requirements, especially regarding the security of Italy's borders and the lives of the Italian people. Therefore, Italy has decided to reject them. He then discussed the situation in Eritrea, stating that in order to achieve rapid progress, a major reorganization of transportation is necessary, and a temporary halt to the transport of troops and 100,000 laborers, essential for any colonial war, is absolutely necessary, especially in the mountainous terrain of the Tigray province. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>According to reports from Rome, the Council of Ministers also approved the agreements signed by the government with Austria, Germany, and Switzerland since the imposition of sanctions by various countries. The Italo-Austrian agreement was signed on the 17th of this month, the Italo-German agreement on the 20th of this month, and the Italo-Swiss agreement on the 3rd of this month. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>According to reliable sources in Paris, Prime Minister Laval has received information that Italy is about to initiate peace talks with Britain and France regarding the Abyssinian issue. After the major debate in the Chamber of Deputies last Saturday, Laval narrowly survived with a majority of only twenty votes, and will now proceed with caution, waiting for Mussolini to make the first move before resuming peace negotiations. The Italian army has now halted its advance in Abyssinia and has even been forced to withdraw from several key points to consolidate its positions. (Kuo Min dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Vast War Expenses; Italian Finances Suffer Significant Deficit</h3>
<p>According to reports from Rome, the final figures for the 1934-1935 fiscal year were released today, showing a deficit of 2,030,000,000 lira. The estimated cost of the war against Abyssinia is 20,000,000 lira per day. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Laval Overcomes Parliament; French Cabinet's Position Remains Unstable; Political Difficulties Resolved, but Financial Difficulties Persist</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources in London, although the Laval government was able to secure a victory in the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday, it is doubtful that it will be able to survive until January of next year. It is believed that after Laval's victory, Europe will temporarily return to calm, and the tension that has filled the capitals of various countries for the past few weeks may temporarily subside. (Kuo Min dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>According to reports from London, the foreign exchange market has revealed the financial world's opinion of the French government's double victory in the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday. The closing price of the French franc on Saturday was 74.94, but it has now risen to 74.54. The US dollar has risen from $4.933125 to $4.929375. The discounts on other gold coins against the British pound have also improved. London circles are now asking whether Prime Minister Laval's victory is merely a temporary reprieve, as there may be many other difficulties before the general election. This can be seen from the forward price of the French franc, which has risen by only 32 centimes, with a discount rate of 2.18. It is generally believed that Laval has overcome his most important political difficulties, but many financial difficulties remain, which may yet lead to his downfall, especially the task of raising tens of billions of francs in public debt, which will be difficult without restoring public confidence in the government.

<h3>Science is All-Powerful: New Discovery of Invisibility; Mysterious Rays Under Mercury Lamps Can Conceal Human Bodies</h3>
<p>According to reports from Paris, Hungarian scientist Preber has recently discovered a mysterious ray in a laboratory in Budapest that can make human bodies invisible.

<h3>Rumors in London Aviation Circles: Lindbergh's Mission to England; Expected to Arrive in Liverpool by Ship Today; One Account Suggests He Will Quietly Disembark in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>According to reports from London, as Lindbergh and his family sailed near the coast of Ireland, the Sunday Express published rumors in aviation circles claiming that Lindbergh will join the board of directors of a major airline that will compete with Imperial Airways and will build six Sikorsky aircraft, each capable of carrying 32 passengers across the Atlantic, worth £50,000. Most of the company's directors are prominent figures in the British aircraft industry. According to information obtained by the Glasgow Immigration Office, Lindbergh may disembark in that city.

<h3>Opening of the Fifth French Salon; Exchanging Artwork for Daily Necessities; Bartering is Revived Today</h3>
<p>According to reports from Paris, five years ago, a painter named Remy, feeling the impact of the economic crisis on artists and their livelihoods, came up with the idea of establishing a so-called "Trade Salon." The method involves artists publicly displaying their works, allowing visitors to exchange them for food, clothing, or other daily necessities, reviving the ancient practice of bartering. The "Trade Salon" has been very successful since its inception. This year is the fifth edition, and it has recently opened. 210 artists are participating, exchanging landscapes, still lifes, and other works for hams, shoes, and clothing. One particularly stylish painter exchanged a portrait for a car, while another exchanged a nude painting for a live pig. Such examples are too numerous to mention. In addition to exchanging goods, the "Trade Salon" also allows for the exchange of services for artwork. Several painters have exchanged their works for dental treatment from fourteen dentists. Some hotel owners have requested painters to decorate their dining rooms in exchange for free accommodation for a certain period. In fact, this practice is not new. In the past, many famous painters in their early days frequented taverns and were often unable to pay their debts. Some tavern owners, who were fond of art, requested these painters to paint murals for them in exchange for clearing their debts. This is especially common in Paris. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Extends Loans to Aid Businesses During the Year-End Period</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance drafts loan measures and submits them to the provincial government for provincial bank compliance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Business in Guangdong Province has been increasingly sluggish this year. Bankruptcies before the end of the year are common. The fundamental reason is that the people are poor and their wealth is exhausted. Purchasing power is weak, and most stores see few customers. The City Industry and Commerce Federation and the City Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a report to the Department of Finance, requesting that commercial loans be provided to aid various industries and ensure a peaceful year-end period, so as not to cause a collapse of all businesses. After receiving the report, the Department of Finance considered the decline of business and the difficulties faced by industry and commerce to be true and drafted measures for providing commercial loans for provincial government approval. The Department of Finance's report is as follows: "Guangdong Province has been affected by the global economic downturn in recent years, resulting in market stagnation and economic decline. Various industries and businesses have experienced difficulties in cash flow, and bankruptcies in the banking industry have occurred one after another. One bankruptcy leads to the associated troubles of related businesses or individuals, resulting in unemployment for workers and bankruptcy for rural areas. This is all due to a lack of capital for operation. Last year, to aid businesses, approval was granted for the City Chamber of Commerce to organize a commercial warehouse warrant committee to issue several million yuan in commercial warehouse warrants. However, the results have been minimal. With the Lunar New Year approaching, businesses are accustomed to settling accounts at the end of the year. However, the market is experiencing a financial drought and a bleak outlook. Without a large amount of cash for adjustment, vitality will be exhausted. It is proposed that the Guangdong Provincial Bank provide commercial loans, with the following four measures: The maximum loan amount is 50,000 yuan. The loan is secured by real estate and fixed assets. The loan amount is based on the registered capital, but the maximum amount should not exceed 5,000 yuan. The monthly interest rate is 7%, and the loan term is six months. In addition, the following two points should be clarified. Regarding collateral, in accordance with Article 2 of the Guangzhou City Real Estate Mortgage Temporary Regulations promulgated on July 13, 1934, the mortgage rights will be published. If there is no objection from a third party after thirty days, the contract will take effect. And in accordance with Article 7, after the court receives the mortgagee's application, it will send personnel to assess the base price of the real estate, and after publication, it will be auctioned after thirty days. The original thirty-day deadline will be reduced to fifteen days, as this loan is to aid businesses so that they can safely get through Lunar New Year. Regarding loans, the deadline will be January 23, 1936 (the end of the Lunar Year). With these measures, borrowers will be able to obtain capital to overcome their difficulties, and lenders will be effectively protected from loss. This is a win-win situation. The Provincial Bank agrees with these measures. Therefore, we submit this report to Your Excellency for review. If approved, please instruct the Provincial Bank to comply, for the public good."

<h3>Songjiang: Detective Team Solves Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Fan Shu's family, a farmer in Mao Kou, Zhou Jia Bang, the fourth district of the county, was robbed by armed bandits on the night of the 29th of last month. Before leaving, they kidnapped a ten-month-old baby boy. The bandits sent a letter to the family, which was intercepted by Yang Shijie, the detective team leader of the Public Security Bureau. On the afternoon of the 29th, when the bandits were scheduled to meet with the victim's family, the police disguised themselves as the victim and went to the appointed location at the Dongta Lane intersection. Two bandits patrolling the road were apprehended by undercover police detectives Shen Guichang and Wei Yunwei. During interrogation, one of them, Mao Jinzhang, admitted to working in the First Branch of the City Forestry Bureau and confessed to kidnapping the child for ransom. He also implicated Zhu Guangyuan, a local resident, as the ringleader. The team leader led detectives to Xitan that night to rescue the hostage but was unsuccessful. They learned that Zhu Guangyuan was hiding at home and arrested him. Zhu claimed to have previously worked for the county as a special agent but denied any involvement in the kidnapping.</p>

<h3>Changshu: Landing Aircraft Damages Crops</h3>
<p>The Eurasia No. 16 aircraft, which was forced to land in Mo Cheng, Yin Zhuang, near Changshu, has suffered extensive damage to its internal machinery and cannot take off. Furthermore, recent rain and snow have made the soil muddy and loose, causing the aircraft to sink by a foot. It has not yet been extracted. Mechanics from Shanghai have been dispatched to dismantle the aircraft. However, due to the local temporary workers' lack of experience in this type of work, progress has been slow. A large barge has been hired to transport the disassembled parts to Shanghai. The aircraft has been stranded at the location for five days, attracting thousands of onlookers daily, resulting in the trampling of the wheat crop in the area. The local farmers have engaged lawyer Xu Houyuan to write to the Shanghai company demanding compensation for the losses.</p>
<h3>Nantong: County Government Prevents Abuse in Smoking Cessation Efforts</h3>

<h3>Hangzhou: Profits and Losses of Banking Industry This Year</h3>
<p>Hangzhou banks have begun settling their accounts and interest payments to various clients on the 15th and 20th of this month. Since the implementation of the legal tender system, the China Transportation Bank and other banks have become busier and have been extending their working hours to complete the work. They should be largely finished by tomorrow (31st) and will implement a major settlement starting on New Year's Day, closing for three days. The banking industry has been generally stable this year, with reduced lending due to the economic downturn. There have been no major difficulties. As for profits, the China Bank has the highest, at over 600,000 yuan. The Jiaotong and Ye banks have profits of over 100,000 yuan. Other banks have also made slight profits, but the amounts are limited. Most money shops have not been able to make a profit.</p>

<h3>After Our Country Declared Legal Tender, What's This? Japanese Residents Issue Banknotes</h3>
<p>Even if issued in Japan, how can they be used in China? Creating an anomalous example of Japanese people using Japanese currency. National Goods Factory Joint Association requests a serious protest.</p>
<p>The issue of Japanese residents in Shanghai issuing Japanese banknotes and circulating them in the market is being taken seriously by our government and people. The Japanese Embassy has indicated that this move was not implemented by New Year's Day due to insufficient preparation, but it is limited to use between Japanese people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Banknotes Denominated in Chinese Yuan</p>
<p>The Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Taiwan, all Japanese banks, have been authorized by the Japanese government to issue Japanese banknotes that circulate throughout Japan. At the same time, the Yokohama Specie Bank once issued banknotes denominated in Chinese Yuan in Shanghai, but due to repeated exclusion and the reliable credit of Chinese banks that consecutively issued banknotes, it was unprofitable and the banknotes denominated in Chinese silver coins were all withdrawn. They have not been seen since.</p>
<p>Places Where Japanese Banknotes Are Used</p>
<p>Japanese banknotes denominated in Japanese Yen, which are commonly referred to as "Old Man Tickets" in our country, are commonly used in Dalian, Changchun, Yingkou, and other ports. They can also be used in Shanghai, but only between Japanese people. If Chinese people receive them, they can go to small money shops in the Sichuan Road area and exchange them for Chinese banknotes according to the telegraphic transfer rate announced daily by the Central Bank. However, a discount is required as a commission for the small money shop.</p>
<p>Japanese Businesses Request to Increase Banknote Issuance</p>
<p>Japanese residents in Shanghai, in view of the overall economic downturn, intend to increase capital by requesting Japanese banks to increase the issuance of Japanese banknotes for use in Shanghai. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired yesterday with Izumimizu, a member of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy. According to him, the issue of issuing Japanese banknotes is "not issued in Shanghai, but still issued in Japan, and carried to Shanghai for use." "Due to insufficient preparation, it is not possible to implement on New Year's Day." "If issued, it will be limited to use between Japanese people" and "cannot be extended to the entire market."</p>
<p>Our Country Attaches Importance to Japanese Banknote Issuance</p>
<p>Our government and banks are paying close attention to the issue of issuing Japanese banknotes. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Secretary-General Lin of the Bank Association yesterday. According to him, Japanese residents in China have been using Japanese banknotes among themselves for a long time. If they want to promote its use between Japanese people and Chinese people, it would have a great impact on our country's entire currency system. It is questionable whether our people can accept it.</p>
<p>National Goods Factory Joint Association Requests to Prohibit It</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association sent telegrams yesterday to Finance Minister Kong and Industry Minister Wu, stating: "The Xinwenbao reported on the 30th of this month that Japanese residents in Shanghai are issuing Japanese banknotes, scheduled to be used starting on New Year's Day of next year. If true, it would disrupt our country's economic unification, undermine the policy of using legal tender, and have a significant impact on the future of industry and commerce. We respectfully request that you investigate and issue a serious protest, and issue an order prohibiting its use, in order to maintain sovereignty and value the currency system."</p>

<p>Yesterday Afternoon Hosting the Four German Pilots</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation's General Manager Li Jingcong, in order to show the hospitality to the four German pilots, who travelled all the way from Germany, hosted a wash-the-dust banquet for them at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fourth Racecourse Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. The four pilots, including pilot Klaus, co-pilot Duss, communications officer Bauliequan, and mechanic Laukeshan, attended the banquet. They were accompanied by German Association President Waldehmen, Lufthansa's Shanghai representative Walde, and other German residents. Li Jingcong delivered a welcome speech, followed by a reply from Klaus. The guests departed happily at 1:00 PM.

In order to select talented people, Zhu has been transferred to the Xi'an Station as Manager. Liang Yun, the Xi'an Station Manager, will replace him at the Shanghai Station.</p>
<h3>Datong Runs Aground in Yangxi</h3>
<p>Forward Cabins Take on Water, Rupturing Four Holes. Must Be Extensively Repaired Before Proceeding to Hankou</p>
<p>The Datong steamer, owned by Dada Company and rented from Ping An Company, left Shashi bound for Hankou. On the morning of the 28th of this month, it reached Yangxi when heavy fog caused it to run aground. The bottom of the ship became mired in a pebble beach, and its heavy weight caused four holes to rupture in the forward cabins, causing significant damage and creating a dangerous situation. Fortunately, the Xiafei steamship came by and the Datong shipowner asked for assistance. The Xiafei towed the Datong ship to a point where, by 10:00 AM of the 28th, with the tide rising, it was able to pull it free. With its engine intact, the Datong was able to proceed to Shashi, where the captain was able to temporarily repair the four holes in the forward cabins with cement and planks. The Datong then sailed from Shashi on the 29th towards Hankou, where it is expected to arrive today. It is reported that, although rescued, the damage sustained by the ship when it ran aground was significant and will require extensive dry dock repairs.</p>

<h3>Today is the Annual Bank Closing; Receipts and Disbursements are More Numerous; All Industries are Steadily Passing Through</h3>
<p>The Money Trade Association Will Hold a General Meeting Today to Approve the Final Closing Date; The Municipal Government, Upon Order, Promulgates the Purpose of Currency Reform</p>
<p>Today is December 31st, the last day of the bank's annual closing. The receipts and disbursements of both the banking and money industries are numerous. The Money Trade Association will hold a regular meeting of its members today to approve the date of the annual final closing. All industries are steadily passing through without other concerns. The Municipal Government, upon order, promulgates to the people to understand the purpose of currency reform. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Banks Conduct Annual Closing</p>
<p>After the savings and commercial departments of each bank began paying interest on December 15th and 20th, respectively, all overdrafts were fully cleared today. Yesterday, the banks handled closing matters, and the internal office hours were extended to 12:00 PM. Today is the last day of the annual closing, and internal office hours will be further extended. The banks will be closed for three days for the New Year starting tomorrow. It is expected that the banks will be able to make a profit due to cautious lending during this overall economic downturn. As for the profit report, it will be released after today.</p>
<p>Receipts and Disbursements of Both Industries are More Numerous Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second to last day of the bank's annual closing, and the receipts and disbursements of both the banking and money industries were more numerous. The total amount of new bills exchanged at the bank clearing house has increased to 33,345,679.16 national currency, of which 5,443,414.47 was collected on behalf of the money industry. The interest rate for public bill clearing is one jiao per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate for public bills is one jiao five fen per thousand yuan per day. The market interest rate for foreign currency clearing in the money industry is also one jiao per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<p>All Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Steadily Pass the End of the Year</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from industrial and commercial enterprises yesterday that all industrial and commercial enterprises can steadily pass the bank closing in the 24th year. Although today is the last day, no unfortunate events are expected to occur. As for the final closing date for all industries in the 24th year, it will arrive in an instant. All industries are now preparing for it. Although it is more serious than the bank's annual closing, since the government's new currency system was implemented, the market's chips have increased. At the same time, after the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications handled interbank lending and overdrafts, and the three banks adjusted the money industry, they also made special accommodations for all industries, so all industries can steadily pass.</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association Holds a Regular Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association decided that January 23rd will be the final closing date for the 24th year of the Republic of China, and decided to hold a regular meeting of its members at 1:00 PM today at its association on Ningbo Road. In addition to approving the final closing date, it will also determine the interest rate for December and prepare all preparations before the final closing. Because today is the last day of the bank's annual closing, the receipts and disbursements will inevitably be very busy. The office hours of each money shop will therefore be extended. Starting tomorrow, the New Year holidays will be two days, according to industry regulations.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, Upon Order, Promulgates to the People</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced on November 4th that the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are legal tender, all sectors have complied with it, and it has been quite effective. Various industries have gradually become active, and all believe that the government's move is very appropriate. The Shanghai Municipal Government, upon order from the Executive Yuan, relayed an order to earnestly promulgate to the people to understand the purpose of this decision to reform the currency system in order to facilitate its progress, and has also ordered its subordinates to comply with it.</p>
<h3>Exerting Efforts to Cooperate in the Arrest of Opium Smokers and Eliminate the Opium Atmosphere; Registration of Opium Smokers in This City Will Be Completed Today; Hereafter, Opium Offenders Must Be Sent to the Headquarters for Legal Action; Today is the Last Day of Publicity, Hoping that Opium Smokers Will Awaken</h3>
<p>The registration of opium smokers in this city has been ongoing for six months, from July 1st to today (31st). Today marks the completion of the registration work for opium smokers in this city. After 6:00 PM, registration will be closed. From tomorrow onwards, opium offenders who are arrested will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters, where they will be sentenced to imprisonment for six months to two years, and fined up to 300 yuan. Those with opium addiction will be given a deadline to receive medical treatment and ordered to quit. To cooperate in the arrest of opium smokers in the concessions, the Public Security Bureau also received a reply from the police department of the Public Concession, agreeing to order its subordinates to handle the matter. Therefore, there is no problem in eliminating the opium atmosphere in this city. As for the anti-opium authorities in this city, they will also mobilize today to conduct a final publicity campaign in the jurisdiction of this city, hoping that opium smokers will finally awaken. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Opium Smoker Registration Ends Today</p>
<p>The registration of opium smokers in this city has now reached the final mandatory period. Today is the last day to complete the registration of opium smokers in this city, in accordance with the telegram from President Chiang. For self-surrendering opium smokers, the last remaining opportunity is fleeting. In order to do its best to persuade opium smokers to awaken, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in addition to sending investigators to cooperate with police officers to vigorously investigate and arrest opium smokers in areas with the most opium smokers, such as the old North Gate and West Gate, also sent Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the opium smoker section, to cooperate with all members of the Municipal Anti-Opium Committee to personally conduct publicity in the city, persuading opium smokers to surrender. Yesterday was the day before the deadline for opium smoker registration, so opium smokers who surrendered were very enthusiastic, totaling 450 people. Nearly 300 opium offenders were also arrested. Today, Section Chief Dai and others will continue to conduct publicity. After office hours in the afternoon, registration will be closed. From tomorrow onwards, opium smokers who are arrested without a license, regardless of whether they are old or sick, will not be issued a certificate of opium cessation, and will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters in this city to be sentenced in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium Crimes, to imprisonment for six months to two years, and fined up to 300 yuan. Those with opium addiction will be given a deadline to receive medical treatment and ordered to quit. In addition, the Public Security Bureau previously stated that cunning opium smokers in the urban area who are being strictly investigated will inevitably flee to the concessions, and the concession authorities are also very serious about anti-opium efforts, so it specifically requested to find a way to cooperate in the arrest. If any citizens report or various agencies request cooperation in the arrest, they will be notified at any time and personnel will be dispatched to cooperate in the arrest. It is learned that the police department of the Public Concession Bureau has replied to the bureau, ordering its subordinates to handle the matter. Therefore, there is no problem in cooperating in the arrest of opium smokers in the special zone.</p>
<p>Measures for Hospitals Designated to Undertake Opium Cessation</p>
<p>In addition to the Shanghai South and Shanghai North Opium Cessation Hospitals for criminals and the soon-to-be-established temporary opium cessation hospital, which are free of charge, the city authorities have specially formulated measures for hospitals that charge fees and undertake temporary opium cessation work, with strict regulations on fees, so as to avoid the abuse of charging excessive fees and placing an excessive burden on opium cessation patients. These measures will be implemented after being reviewed by the municipal government. The full text of the measures is recorded below: Measures for the Management of Hospitals Designated to Undertake Temporary Opium Cessation Work in This City. In order to promote opium cessation work and facilitate opium smokers to pay for opium cessation, the city may select suitable hospitals from the hospitals registered and approved by the Municipal Health Bureau to undertake temporary opium cessation work. Hospitals designated to undertake temporary opium cessation work shall comply with the provisions of these measures in handling the admission and discharge of opium cessation patients and all procedures. Each designated hospital shall record in detail the name, age, gender, origin, occupation, address, addiction type, and treatment records of opium cessation patients, and keep them properly for inspection. Each designated hospital may require opium cessation patients to prepay fees or find a guarantor. Each hospital may charge opium cessation patients according to the following regulations: A. First-class ward: 4 to 6 yuan per person per day, including food and medical expenses. B. Second-class ward: 2 to 3 yuan per person per day, including food and medical expenses. C. Third-class ward: 1 yuan per person per day, including food and medical expenses. D. All injections, medicines, and tonics may be charged separately by each hospital after consultation with the opium cessation patient. Opium cessation patients must be hospitalized for treatment and may not leave the hospital freely. They may only be issued a certificate of opium cessation by the treatment hospital if the treatment hospital believes that they have completely quit opium. The format of this certificate will be determined separately. Each hospital, after an opium cessation patient has completely quit opium, shall immediately fill out a triplicate report form, send two copies to the Public Security Bureau and the Health Bureau for reference, and keep the remaining copy for future reference. (The format of this report form will be determined separately.) They shall also fill out a monthly opium cessation performance report in quadruplicate at the end of each month and submit it to the Health Bureau for review. Any opium cessation certificate issued by a hospital that has not been approved to undertake temporary opium cessation work will be considered invalid by the municipal opium cessation authorities. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and Health Bureau may send personnel to the designated hospitals at any time to inspect and supervise opium cessation work, and may also randomly select people who have quit opium from each hospital and send them to the municipal opium cessation agency for verification. If a designated hospital violates the provisions of these measures or has other malpractices, its designated qualification may be revoked at any time upon discovery. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau Announces Collection of Land Value Tax for the 25th Year; Limited to Two Months from January 16th; Tax Payment Certificates Will Now Be Issued</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued Bulletin No. 319 yesterday, stating, "It has been investigated that the first installment of the provisional land value tax for the 25th year, which should be collected in Districts 1 to 7 of the South Shanghai District, Districts 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 of the Zhabei District, Districts 5, 6, and 8 of the Yinxiang District, Districts 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the Yangjing District, Districts 1 to 4 of the Fahua District, and District 1 of the Pusong District, will be levied starting on January 16th of the 25th year, and must be paid within two months from the date of levy, until March 15th of the 25th year. Those whose land is in the South Shanghai District should bring the receipt from the previous period and pay at the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office of this Bureau at Maojia Lane, Outer Malu, Nanshi. Those in the Zhabei and Yinxiang Districts should bring the receipt from the previous period and pay at the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office of this Bureau at Datong Road, Zhabei. Those in the Yangjing District should bring the receipt from the previous period and pay at the East Shanghai Tax Collection Office of this Bureau at Chunjiang Wharf, Pudong. Those in the Fahua and Pusong Districts should bring the receipt from the previous period and pay at the West Shanghai Tax Collection Office of this Bureau at the intersection of Roberts Road and Binlang Road. If the payment is overdue, it will be pursued in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Land Value Tax Collection Regulations and Article 24 of the Implementation Rules, and interest will be charged on the amount owed, as well as collecting the income from the land and auctioning it to offset the price according to the number of years in arrears, in order to comply with the regulations and emphasize tax revenue. It has also been investigated that when taxpayers pay the land value tax, they must bring the receipt from the previous period for inspection. Now, because this receipt has matters such as land transfer, collection and use, merger and measurement, or registration, it must be submitted to the Land Bureau as evidence of tax payment and management, so that when continuing to pay taxes, it is necessary to report to this Bureau, verify the facts, and issue a certificate of tax payment before it can be paid. If the procedures are not clear, the payment time will inevitably be delayed. In order to facilitate taxpayers, this Bureau has formulated remedial measures, planning to issue a tax payment certificate to each taxpayer when they pay the first installment of the 25th year and make up for the land value tax from the previous period, indicating the year, tax period, and precautions to be taken when paying taxes. In the future, holding this certificate to pay taxes will eliminate the need to present the receipt from the previous period, in order to be simple and convenient. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government for record and mailing this period's notification, this announcement is jointly issued, and all taxpayers should abide by it and pay within the time limit, without delay, lest they be punished. If the notification has not yet been received, they should, within the time limit, provide the land location, diagram number, and present address or mailing address to the Bureau for verification and resending of the duplicate, and still pay at the office with the receipt from the previous period and receive the tax payment certificate for application, without error. This bulletin, Cai Zengji, Director."</p>

The French authorities are also able to respect public opinion, and all legitimate protests are accepted. Therefore, the citizens of the concession directly and indirectly benefit from it. The association is self-satisfied with what it has done in the past two years. The following is an excerpt of the more important cases: The Shanghai Municipal History Museum sought historical materials from the French Concession; searched for and compiled the Sino-French New Agreement signed by the French for the expansion of the concession; repeatedly requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to subsidize the association's operating expenses; achieved complete victory in the Chen Juchang carpentry protest against the health donation; residents of Malong Road, Father Jin Road, Qianjiatang, and Avenue Joffre requested the Municipal Council to exempt them from increased house donations; the Fenjiu Industry Association requested exemption from increased alcohol donations; the French Concession provided subsidies for primary and secondary schools; negotiations to increase the number of Chinese directors; taxpayers requested exemption from house donations for public welfare projects; and Caishi Road and Bai'er Road requested the construction of sidewalks.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reviews the Rent Law; The Municipal Federation Requests Setting Rent Standards For a Reason; The Disguised Double Rent Should Be Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>In recent years, the rent problem in Beijing and Shanghai has been entangled. The Executive Yuan has convened representatives from the Ministry of Finance and other departments and representatives from Beijing and Shanghai to review the draft of the Rent Dispute Mediation Law. In order to make it suitable for the actual situation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Government transferred it to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Council for their opinions. In addition to the Municipal Party Headquarters responding, the Municipal Council also convened a review meeting on the 18th of this month. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Chen Guangfu, Du Yuesheng, and Xu Yongzuo were present. Regarding Article 2 of the draft law, "House rent shall be determined by the local competent authorities in consideration of local circumstances and submitted to the higher authorities for approval. The maximum limit of the aforementioned rent standard shall not exceed 12% of the annual interest rate of the total land price and construction cost." Although the interest rate in this article is based on the Land Law and local facts, such as the interest rate in Shanghai, which is generally below 1%, and the profit of the rent, which is generally only 5% to 6% of the land price and construction cost, the Shanghai Municipal Federation requests the authorities to set the rent standard at 5%, which is justified. According to economic principles, the more developed the society, the lower the interest rate. The spirit of legislation is to hope for the progress of society, and it seems that this standard should not be too high. It should be limited to 10% at most, so that the high interest rate in the inland can gradually be equalized. This is not only suitable for the situation in Shanghai, but also in line with the spirit of legislation. Article 3 of the original draft states, "The house rent mentioned in the preceding article refers to the amount paid periodically by the tenant to the landlord for the use of the house. Other matters relating to house rent in accordance with local customs may be determined by the local competent authorities in consideration of local circumstances, within the scope of not conflicting with the law." It is explained that "In addition to restricting the excessively high security deposits in various places, there are other similar facts about house rent in various places, which may be approved within the scope of not conflicting with the law." Since the rent has a standard, this disguised double rent should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, the second half of Article 3 can be deleted. For the sake of taking into account customs and protecting the legitimate interests of landlords, it can only be stipulated that the security deposit can be collected up to two months' rent, so as to avoid landlords using Article 3 to charge various fees. Article 4 seems to be determined for both sides, and the rent standard is revised every five years. In fact, the collection of rent is calculated according to the interest rate of the land price and construction cost. After the house is built, its construction cost does not increase or decrease with the price level thereafter, and it often decreases due to annual depreciation. The only changes are the land price and the market interest rate. However, the increase in land price is caused by the public, not the landlord, and the landlord should not enjoy its benefits alone. Now that it is not attributed to the public, the result of the increase in land price is that the property has already increased, and then the rent is increased for the tenant. The double benefit is too great. As for the change in interest rate, real estate is a more secure investment, and the profit should not be in the same proportion as the general interest rate. If it is for the sake of general people's livelihood, it is feasible to reduce the rent when the interest rate is low (such as when the house is old), and it is difficult to increase the rent when the interest rate is high. Therefore, if the rent standard is revised every five years, it is feared that there will be many disputes at that time. Moreover, there are many provisions in the lease part of the Civil Law on Obligations. The law seems that it is not necessary to stipulate it in another article." It is heard that the Municipal Council has replied to the Municipal Government accordingly.</p>

<h3>Kiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee: Sends Secretary to Investigate Anti-Smoking Situation; Visited Various Anti-Smoking Institutions in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Kiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee has set January 1st of next year as the date for the province-wide re-registration and general inspection of reformed smokers. All measures and propaganda strategies must be carefully planned. Since Shanghai has already begun re-registration of reformed smokers and has achieved good results, the committee has specially sent its secretary, Dai Shiying, to Shanghai to investigate for future reference. It is learned that Mr. Dai arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 29th. Yesterday, officials from the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee were responsible for leading him on a tour of various anti-smoking institutions. Today, he will visit the Public Security Bureau's propaganda team to observe their propaganda efforts. It is said that Mr. Dai will spend a week in Shanghai and return to the province next Monday to report his findings.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying's Intention to Resign Has Been Abandoned: The Executive Yuan Agreed to Allocate Additional Funds; Xu Scheduled to Go to the Capital on the Evening of the 2nd</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Jingren, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, had repeatedly requested the Executive Yuan to resign from all his positions due to the committee's financial difficulties. Premier Chiang believed that Mr. Xu had been in politics for ten years, had always been honest and self-disciplined, and had personally visited various places despite the frequent disasters over the years. His spirit of service was admirable, and he was urged to continue his work to benefit the disaster victims. Later, Mr. Xu insisted that the committee's operating expenses were too low, averaging a deficit of three to four hundred yuan per month. Not only did all the staff members feel hungry while working, but there were also many obstacles to the work, making it like a skilled housewife struggling to cook without rice. Therefore, he submitted three more resignations. Premier Chiang, puzzled by Mr. Xu's insistence on resigning, specially summoned Mr. Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the committee, to the capital to inquire in detail. After Mr. Zhu explained the above difficulties, Premier Chiang said that a shortage of three hundred yuan per month was not a problem. He sent a telegram to Mr. Xu, still urging him to stay, and instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate additional funds to the committee on a monthly basis. If Mr. Xu must resign, Mr. Zhu should take over the position, and the national government would offer Mr. Xu a new position so that he would not retire. Mr. Zhu telegraphed Premier Chiang's intentions to Mr. Xu, stating the government's earnest reliance on him. Therefore, Mr. Xu's intention to resign has been completely abandoned. He goes to the Relief Committee as usual every day to handle important matters and is scheduled to go to the capital on the evening of January 2nd to seek instructions on winter relief matters.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Smokers: To Begin Self-Registration Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has completed the propaganda for smokers' self-registration in recent days, and it will be officially carried out starting on January 1st (tomorrow).

At the same time, the County Government has instructed all districts to specifically order the Baojia chiefs to pay attention to persuading unregistered smokers to quickly awaken and reform themselves to avoid legal punishment. Those who previously registered under false names are also ordered to apply for correction.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and United States: Newly Appointed Diplomatic Personnel to China</h3>

<h3>Office of the Captain of the Aviation Association Recruitment Team: 40th Office Meeting; Solicitation Work to Gradually End Within January of Next Year</h3>
<p>The Office of the Captain of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the Chinese Aviation Association held a meeting to discuss the progress of solicitation and fundraising. Attendees included Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhou Songhe, Chen Shuo, Huang Jun, Zhang Yumin, Liu Songtao, Li Jiming, Wei Jianxin, Yang Peiwun, Bao Lengxue, Li Huiran, Zhu Shengyang, etc. The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao, and Chen Shuo served as the recording secretary. Chairman Li reported that the work of each recruitment team was originally scheduled to end at the end of this month, as stated in previous circulars. However, each team is still actively soliciting donations, making it difficult to complete everything. The work has been extended to gradually end within January of next year. He hoped that the field secretaries would intensify their assistance. The dance halls have been collecting aviation patriotic donations. Since changing the method to have each hall collect the donations along with the billing, the results have been quite good since it began on the 23rd of this month. The catering industry is conducting aviation patriotic donations, and after dispatching personnel to negotiate, a meeting of all Chinese and Western restaurants in the city was convened on the 24th. It was decided to collect one percent of the business revenue, starting on January 15th of next year, and the results are expected to be considerable. The Shanghai West District exhibition of the Aviation Patriotic Mobile Simple Exhibition opened on the 16th of this month at the Caowan Times Middle School. Despite the continuous rain, visitors thronged the venue. Due to the needs of the situation, the original exhibition period will be extended. After the Shanghai West District exhibition ends, the dates and locations for the Shanghai North District and Special District exhibitions are being coordinated and prepared. Following the reports from each field secretary on the progress of negotiations and ongoing investigations in various industries, multiple fundraising proposals were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Two Charity Organizations Handling Winter Relief in Hubei Province: Yichang, Shashi Winter Relief, and Zhongxiang Investigation and Distribution Situation</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society and the United Office of the China Southeast Associations, in conjunction with the Renji Road Huayang Yizhen Association, are organizing various aspects of relief work along the Yangtze River, as reported in previous issues. Yesterday, we learned that the association received reports from relief commissioners Li Tianzhen and You Jiashen regarding the disaster situation in Yisha and the investigation and distribution situation in Zhongxiang. The report is recorded as follows: The Zhongxiang relief grain has already been transported. The sixth district covers a vast area of ​​more than a hundred li in circumference, mostly mountains and lakes. Disaster victims live in scattered locations. When the team investigated and distributed aid, they crossed streams and waded through water. Even with the leadership of the Baojia chiefs, it was often difficult to distinguish east from west and they lost their way, resulting in delays. Team members Wang and others, due to getting lost and wading through water, were trapped in the mud and nearly drowned. Moreover, bandits were everywhere, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and they encountered rainstorms with no place to hide in the wilderness. They walked more than 20 li in the rain late at night before reaching Longjiaji. Although exhausted, they were still extremely excited and did not avoid hardships. The investigation and distribution in the sixth district has now been completed, and the second and ninth districts are being actively processed. The disaster situation in Yichang and Shashi is dire, no less than in Zhongxiang. In this severe winter, the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, and people are collapsing. The relief funds of more than 20,000 yuan that were originally planned to be distributed are insufficient due to the vast disaster area. In addition to Commissioner Yu Jiashen's advance to Shayi last week to investigate, it is planned to send a team to provide relief. It is still hoped that appeals will be made to all sectors of society to raise more relief funds to provide aid. After receiving the telegram from the Red Swastika Society and the Huayang Yizhen Association, the Huayang Yizhen Association allocated an additional 4,000 yuan in relief funds, and continued to add 2,000 sets of relief clothing. The Red Swastika Society also allocated an additional 2,000 yuan in relief funds and more than 2,600 pieces of relief clothing and cotton quilts. In addition, the Dezi Trading Company donated 1,200 pieces of Indanthrene blue and An'an color cloth (5 yards per piece), 2,500 boxes of eye drops, and 5,000 packets of dysentery powder, which were shipped separately on the 27th of this month for relief. Fundraising is still being coordinated.</p>
<h3>Citywide Pawnshop Industry: To Shorten Pawn Period Tomorrow; Uniformly Changed to Twelve Months; Pawn Interest Still Handled According to Old System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Industry Association, in accordance with the request of its members to maintain their livelihoods, has received approval from the Municipal Government to shorten the standard pawn period to twelve months. This was resolved at a joint meeting of old and new pawnshop owners on the 17th of this month and will be officially implemented on January 1st, 1936 (tomorrow). According to a reporter from the Industrial News Agency's interview with Mr. Lian Jieren of the industry, he said that the decision to shorten the pawn period was a last resort, and the original state would be restored as soon as the city's economy recovered. The industry is almost completely unified on shortening the pawn period, with 45 old pawnshops and 27 new pawnshops. The pawn interest will still be 1.8%, plus 0.2% for warehouse rent. It is feared that the original pawn period would be shortened further due to the short original duration.</p>

On the afternoon of the 31st, a New Year's Eve forum was convened by the Youth Service Corps and the Juvenile Mutual Aid Corps to discuss the progress of the work.

<h3>City Public Security Bureau: Orders Strict Prohibition of Gambling; The Teahouse Owner Will Be Held Responsible if Gambling is Discovered in Teahouses</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been cases of gambling and profit-sharing in various teahouses in the city from time to time. The City Public Security Bureau has repeatedly ordered investigations and prohibitions. It is learned that Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun believes that gambling is the most harmful, causing people to pawn their clothes and belongings if it is a small matter, and ruin their families if it is a big matter, and that it is not allowed by law. Although a notice has been issued to strictly prohibit it, the speakers are earnest, and the listeners are indifferent, and it is inevitable that stubbornness will arise over time. Therefore, yesterday, he ordered each branch bureau and each police station to reiterate the prohibition.

<h3>Gu Peiyuan: Confesses to Defrauding a Large Sum of Money; Conscience Compelled Him to Confess the Truth; Another Person Named Ye Also Accuses Him of Being Deceived</h3>
<p>Zhu Shien (also known as Junmu, Zhanfu), a real estate merchant from Yin County, Zhejiang Province, residing at No. 25 Anren Street, Xinbeimen, Nanshi, owns a lot of money. His eldest son, Zhu Yinting, is 17 years old and studies at Yinghua Shuguan. Recently, he was defrauded of a huge sum of 45,115 yuan in foreign currency by Gu Peiyuan (also known as Naiping), the owner of the Yuanji Driving School at No. 44 Guangdong Road, through methods such as physiognomy and divination, causing him to speculate in gold speculation. After reporting the case, the General Patrol Room arrested Gu and confiscated about 30,000 yuan, which was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the First Special Court, continued the interrogation in the first criminal court. Gu Peiyuan hired lawyers Du Jimei and Xi Shichang to defend him. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the defendant had completely denied the facts of the case last time, but during the adjournment period, the defendant had fully confessed to everything in the police station and had written a confession. It was also found that the defendant had published advertisements in the newspaper under the name Fang Juelu, offering free physiognomy, and the location was in the Yuanji shop. He then presented the confession newspapers to the court. Subsequently, Niu Sheng, the principal of Yinghua Shuguan, filed a case, proving that Zhu Yinting's age was sixteen years old according to British calculation, but his grades in all subjects were poor, so he was in the lowest grade. Dai Weiyang, a trainee at the Yuanji shop, also filed a case, proving that Zhu Yinting came to Yuanji to learn to drive, and Gu helped him with his fortune-telling, saying that he had mourning clothes. Later, Zhu's mother died, and Zhu firmly believed in Gu's words. Later, Gu asked me to investigate Zhu's situation and the number of people in his family, and I conducted the investigation for him. When questioned, Gu Peiyuan confessed that he did not recognize it last time because the plaintiff had no evidence. Later, he was driven by his conscience, so he fully recognized it, and then he explained the details of the matter in detail. As for the method of displaying words on red paper, he used Ming Panhua water to write on the paper, covered it with incense ash, and the words would appear. Police lawyer Wang stated that a person named Ye had come to report that he had also been deceived by the defendant, so further investigation was needed. Qian, the chief judge, approved it and scheduled another interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Murder of Chen Hongfu: The Girl Was Not Found After Being Summoned; She Was Hidden Elsewhere</h3>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a native of Chongming living in Yanjiajiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered in the middle of the night last month. When Prosecutor Li Fen of the local court came to examine the body, he found that the deceased's wife, Chen Huang, did not show any sorrow, which aroused suspicion. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau detained her and sent her to the court for interrogation and detention. Later, it was discovered that Lu Zhiliang, the deceased's maternal uncle, was also a major suspect in the case. Therefore, Lu was arrested and detained, and visits were prohibited to prevent collusion. Prosecutor Li, in order to be cautious, personally went to the scene of the incident to secretly investigate and found that the daughter of Chen Huang was already asleep that night. She was awakened by the sound and saw a tragic scene under the lamplight. Afterwards, she revealed the situation, and the public was in an uproar. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. It is learned that the court wanted to understand the truth at that time and repeatedly summoned the girl for detailed questioning, hoping to avoid any injustice. However, the girl had already been hidden by others and had not yet appeared in court. After Chen Hongfu's tragic death, his brother Chen Qiufu requested an exemption from the examination. According to common sense, if a younger brother is murdered by someone, the elder brother should stand up for him and seek justice. How could he shield the murderer and request an exemption from the investigation? There is obviously something suspicious about this. It was recently found that the girl was taken away by Chen Qiufu and hidden at the home of Chen Genxiang, a fellow villager in Zhoujiadu. The court dispatched police to the address yesterday to summon her, but she was still not found. It seems that she has been taken to another place to stay.</p>
<h3>Female Doctor Tsai Mary Requests to Dissolve Engagement; Fiancé Exaggerates and Borrows Money Without Repaying; Summons Cannot Be Delivered, Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>Tsai Mary, a 21-year-old obstetrician at the Benevolent Obstetrics Hospital at No. 926, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Cardinal Mercier, and a native of Pudong, was betrothed last year in Songpo through her parents' arrangement to a fellow villager. Now, Tsai has suddenly filed a petition with the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, requesting the dissolution of the engagement and the return of a borrowed sum of 1,000 yuan. The court approved the request, and yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi presided over the Fourth Civil Court for the hearing. Wang Songpo did not appear, so Tsai Mary testified that on the eighth day of the fourth month of last year, with her mother's consent, she became engaged to the defendant in Songpo. He claimed to be a graduate of Jinan University and to have served as a staff member of the municipal government, as well as a senior official of the telegraph bureau. However, not long after the engagement, the defendant claimed to have been appointed as a staff member of the First Section of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangdong Province, the truth of which is unknown. When he returned to Shanghai in August, he discussed marriage with her, but she refused, as she was still studying and felt she lacked the autonomy to make such a decision. In September, the defendant again claimed that he would be appointed as the chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Elbow Administration Bureau, but needed a large sum of money and asked her to find a way to get it. Considering him a friend and believing that one should help friends in times of need, especially as they were engaged, she borrowed 1,000 yuan from relatives and friends on September 24th, 28th, and 30th, and handed it over to the defendant. At the time, the defendant promised to repay it on October 1st, but when October 1st arrived, he claimed that the matter had not yet been settled and asked her to raise a considerable sum of money again. She then became suspicious and, since the money was borrowed, asked him to issue a written receipt. The defendant reluctantly agreed. Later, she repeatedly urged him to repay, but the defendant gave her a liquidation slip from the Ken Yeh Bank, falsely claiming it was a promissory note. Such behavior was all deceitful, so she requested a judgment to dissolve the engagement and return the borrowed money, etc. She then presented the receipt and the false promissory note as evidence, along with a letter in which the defendant boasted that Minister of Finance Kong, Cai Zengji of the Municipal Finance Bureau, former Vice Minister Zheng Hongnian, and the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard could all guarantee him. If the aforementioned individuals could indeed guarantee him, then the matter could be resolved. The court then announced that when the summons for the defendant was delivered to No. 11, Changyuan Lane, Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, it was claimed that he had already left and his whereabouts were unknown. His family had already placed an advertisement in the newspaper to find him, so they refused to accept the summons. She was asked for her opinion on this point, and Miss Tsai stated that this was perhaps a conspiracy between them. Since they refused to accept the summons, she requested that it be served by public notice and that his father, Wang Ruiqing, be summoned to court. Judge Peng verified the testimony and ordered the hearing to be postponed.</p>
<h3>Pregnancy Mistaken for Amenorrhea; Fetus Dislodges After Taking Medicine; Doctor Yu Zuotang Accused</h3>
<p>Yu Zuotang, a gynecologist at No. 72, Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Xu Yizeng, the owner of Hongyun Photo Studio on Nanjing Road, through his lawyer, accusing Yu of committing abortion and other offenses. The factual circumstances are that Xu's wife, who was four months pregnant, recently felt unwell. Having heard that Yu Zuotang was a direct descendant of a famous gynecologist from Ningbo's Lao Song Street, she went to him for treatment. Unexpectedly, Yu diagnosed her with amenorrhea, leading to the fetus dislodging after she took the medicine, causing the patient great suffering. Xu believed that Yu Zuotang had made a mistake in prescribing the medicine and therefore sued him. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court for the hearing. The plaintiff, Xu Yizeng, did not appear, nor did a lawyer represent him. The defendant, Yu Zuotang, also did not appear, but his lawyer arrived and requested a postponement. Judge Jiang ordered the case to be postponed and reheard on January 11th of next year.</p>

<p>Zhu Guangbu, a native of Wuxi, and his wife, Zhu Zhou, who reside at No. 1308, Liuhefang, Robison Road, were previously accused by their fellow villager, Zhang Chengda, of obtaining money by deception through religious practices and intimidation. Zhang Chengda filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The case had already been heard once, with the testimony being clear and awaiting judgment. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi, who presided over the trial, announced the verdict in the Third Criminal Court. The verdict stated that the evidence presented in the accusation was insufficient, and Zhu Guangbu and Zhu Zhou were found not guilty. However, Zhu and others believed that Zhang's false accusation had greatly affected their reputation and planned to file an independent lawsuit against Zhang for making a false accusation.</p>
<h3>New York Dance Hall; Russian Gatekeeper Murders Manager; Cause: Dismissal for Inappropriate Conduct; Shot and Killed at the Entrance, Attempted to Escape, Arrested</h3>
<p>The New York Dance Hall at No. 4, Rue Chu Pao San, is organized by Russians. Although small in scale, its business is quite good and is considered one of the best among the dance halls in the vicinity. It hired a White Russian, Yin Caiqin, as the manager. Most of the dancers inside are of Russian origin, as are the doormen. Recently, the doorman's conduct was inappropriate, and he was dismissed by the manager, leading to resentment and the evil intention of revenge. At 9:30 last night, the doorman hid a handgun and waited at the entrance. Upon seeing Yin Caiqin arrive, he quickly drew the gun and fired a shot that went straight through his chest. He bled profusely and died on the spot. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled towards Rue de la Cathédrale, but was apprehended by the patrol officers who arrived after hearing the alarm. He was taken to the Grand Clock Police Station for investigation.</p>

<p>The Transportation Committee of the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Nanjing-Shanghai, in order to ensure the safety of traffic on the highways within the five provinces and cities, held a meeting in Nanjing a few days ago to earnestly discuss and study the safety equipment for traffic on the highways. Subsequently, to ensure the safety of highway passengers, the committee sent letters to the authorities along the routes, requesting them to negotiate with reputable local hospitals to become designated hospitals for the Transportation Committee of the five provinces and cities, so that when traffic accidents occur, passengers can be sent for treatment at any time. It is learned that the municipal government has sent letters to the committee stating that the Shanghai Red Cross Hospital and other hospitals have agreed to join as designated hospitals.</p>
<h3>Trial Concluded for Private Manufacturing of Counterfeit Banknotes; Verdict to Be Announced Next Monday</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinshan (also known as Zhang Xifang), a native of Wuxi, previously escaped after colluding with others to privately manufacture counterfeit banknotes. He was recently apprehended by the Hongkou police and handed over to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered him to be detained for investigation. This was reported in this newspaper. It is learned that Zhang's case was discovered in May of this year. The counterfeit banknotes were one-yuan bills of the Bank of China. At the time of the case's cracking, as many as 14,300 bills had been manufactured. His accomplices, Huang Shiliang, Wang Rongguang, and others, have already been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment by the court. After Huang confessed Zhang at the time, Chinese and Western detectives went to Zhang's house to search, but Zhang had already fled upon hearing the news. Only two photos were seized. It is now verified that Zhang invested 100 yuan in this illegal business. Yesterday morning, the police sent detectives to the Western Prison to bring in the two criminals, Huang and Wang, and handed Zhang over to the court. Judge Xiao Xieban interrogated him. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the situation and requested that the defendant be punished in accordance with Article 196 of the Criminal Code. The court then interrogated Huang Shiliang, but Huang's testimony was all to exonerate Zhang. When questioned, Zhang also stubbornly denied everything and hired lawyer Wang Liangqing to defend him. After the interrogation, Judge Xiao ordered Zhang Jinshan to be returned to custody, pending the announcement of the verdict next Monday. Huang and Wang were sent back to the Western Prison for imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Birthday Celebration for Mother; Case of Thugs Extorting Money Concluded; Verdict Scheduled for 2 PM Today</h3>
<p>Two petty thugs, Yan Zulai, nicknamed "Holland Water Bottle," 24 years old, residing at No. 14, Yinyu Lane, Eight Immortals Bridge, spend their days loitering at the Xiafei Tea House at No. 34, Avenue Joffre, specializing in extortion. They consider the area around the North and South Zhujia Bridges as their territory, and often issue invitations under false pretenses, collecting gifts and extorting money in various ways. They regard the nearby salted meat shops, brothels, and prostitutes as their prey. If their demands are not met, they take the opportunity to extort money under false pretenses. The victims fear the evil influence of their gang and mostly endure the pain without arguing, aiming to avoid trouble. Recently, on the occasion of Yan's mother's 58th birthday, Yan issued a large number of invitations, scheduling the celebration for his mother's sixtieth birthday on the 26th of this month at the Sanhe Restaurant in Xixinqiao. In addition to issuing invitations to various Korean brothels and prostitutes, he also distributed them to shops in the vicinity. The matter was discovered by Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French Concession Police, who believed that Yan often extorted money under false pretenses, which was a violation of the law. Therefore, at 4 PM on the 26th, he led detectives Zhang Ziying and Dai Rongji to the Sanhe Restaurant, first arresting Luo Weixiang, a native of Ningbo (23 years old, residing at No. 169, Rue Challe, a member of Yan's gang), who was responsible for receiving gifts and keeping accounts for Yan. They also seized a large number of gift registers, gifts, remaining invitations, and thank-you notes. Then, they went to the Xiafei Tea House and arrested Yan, taking him and the others to the police station and sending them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. This was reported in this newspaper. At 11 AM yesterday, Judge Xiong of the Second Special Court presided over the interrogation in the First Criminal Court. First, lawyer Fei Xizhen from the Police Department explained the case and filed charges of fraud in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Code, requesting an investigation and trial. Subsequently, ten witnesses, including the madams of Korean brothels Sun Zhu, Zhang Wang, Wu Zhao, Ma Gao, Lu Mao, Wu Wang, Tang Zhang, Wang Lin, Jin Guiying, Kong Linji, and Hua Jintang, testified one after another, stating that they did not know the defendant. They said that the invitations stated that they should send a gift of two yuan, and they would come to collect it. Some stated that they did not send gifts because they did not know him. When Yan Zulai was interrogated, he claimed that he distributed invitations to celebrate his mother's birthday and did not forcefully extort money. Luo Weixiang testified that Yan invited him to help and he did not dare to extort money with him. Finally, the detectives reported that after arresting the defendant, they investigated the Sanhe Restaurant. According to the owner of the restaurant, the defendant only paid a deposit of two yuan and had not confirmed the number of tables for the banquet, saying that it would be settled after the meal. The court verified the testimonies and ordered the arguments to be concluded, scheduling the verdict to be announced at 2 PM on the 31st (today). The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Yang Yutang Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Yang Yutang, a native of Jiangbei, also known as Yang Yutang, 22 years old, made a living by running a small business. On the afternoon of the 29th, at 4 PM, he went alone to the Ying'an Inn at No. 396, Avenue de la République in the French Concession, and rented Room No. 9. For some unknown reason, he took his own life. That night, he swallowed raw opium in the inn and committed suicide. At 11 AM the next day, the tea boy Wang Guisheng went upstairs to urge him to get up. He knocked on the door and called out for a long time, but there was no response. When he pried open the door and entered, he found that Yang had already died on the bed. He immediately reported to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to investigate.

<p>At the home of Zhang Yangfu, a local, at No. 8, Jing 17th Lane, Rue Massenet, at around 4 AM yesterday, six men suddenly entered the house, falsely claiming to be searching for smoking paraphernalia. They searched the inner rooms and used handguns to restrain the Zhang's family in one room. They forced them to hand over the keys to the boxes and looted the property. After about 40 minutes, they left with their loot. After checking the losses, the total amount reached more than 2,700 yuan, mostly jewelry. Zhang Yangfu reported the incident to the police station in charge, who sent detectives to investigate and filed the case for tracking and arrest.</p>
<h3>Violent Assault After Refusal to Lend Money</h3>

Wang Dongtong lived at No. 149, Dongwende Lane, Pingliang Road, while Chen belonged to Longjia, next door to the Yuanchang South Goods Store on Yangshupu Road. However, Chen had been laid off by the Xiangtai foreman and had grievances with Wang due to disagreements in the past, so there was resentment between them. Yesterday afternoon, at around 5 PM, Wang Dongtong left the factory after work. Unexpectedly, he met Chen at the factory gate. Chen immediately asked to borrow money and spoke disrespectfully. Wang, in a moment of anger, retorted, leading to a heated argument between the two sides. Unexpectedly, Chen Sailong pulled out a sharp axe and struck Wang's head with it. Wang immediately bled profusely and fell to the ground. Fortunately, Wang Dongtong had two companions who saw Wang being attacked and ran to the nearby police post to report the incident. Chen Sailong was arrested on the spot, taken to the police station, and will be handed over to the court for trial. Wang was sent to the hospital for treatment.

Yesterday afternoon, at around 8 PM, someone went to the parlor to look for Zhang Yuzhen, falsely claiming to be a partner from the Xuehuai Photo Studio next door, saying that someone had called Zhang and asked her to go to answer the phone. At that time, Zhang Yuzhen knew that the parlor did not have a phone and that calls were usually made through the Xuehuai Photo Studio, so she did not hesitate and went downstairs. Unexpectedly, just as she stepped out of the door, a man suddenly jumped out from the left side of the door, holding a bottle of corrosive liquid and splashing it all over her head. Zhang Yuzhen was caught off guard and could not escape, so her face and clothes were burned by the corrosive liquid, and she rolled around on the ground. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled the alley. Fortunately, nearby patrol officers arrived and sent her to the hospital for treatment. The police questioned her about the reason for the attack. According to Zhang, she had no enemies and suspected that her lover, Zhang Aliu, was involved in the incident. Therefore, the police are investigating.</p>
<h3>Continental Bank Attempts to Cancel Bond Subscription Contracts; Thirteen Banks File a Lawsuit; Lawsuit Filed Against the Bank for Breach of Contract and Payment of Interest; Defendant Claims Contract Should Be Abandoned Due to Government's Unified Issuance Policy</h3>
<p>In order to promote the circulation of their banknotes in the market and regulate finance, banks in Shanghai that issue banknotes have entered into bond subscription contracts with general banks and Qian Zhuang that do not have the right to issue banknotes. One party gains the benefit of promoting banknotes, and the other party gains the convenience of business. The term of these contracts is usually three or five years. The subscriber must deposit 40% of the face value in cash with the banknote-issuing bank as a guarantee for the bond subscription, and the banknote-issuing bank must pay interest on the guarantee deposit, usually calculated at an annual rate of 6.5%. However, since the Ministry of Finance implemented currency reform on November 4th of this year,</p>
<p>and the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were adopted as legal tender, some banknote-issuing banks seized the opportunity to issue circulars to various bond-subscribing banks and Qian Zhuang, intending to cancel the previously signed bond subscription contracts. After deliberation among the banks and Qian Zhuang, they unanimously opposed it. The bank also realized that it lacked a justification and voluntarily abandoned the proposal to cancel the contracts. But one wave had barely subsided before another arose. Now, the Continental Bank is also seeking to cancel such contracts, leading to a lawsuit against it. The Qian Zhuang that have subscribed to bonds from the Continental Bank</p>
<p>include Huafeng, Runfeng, Zhentai, Changshun, Yisheng, Fuchang, Yuzhong, Wanmao, Huatong, Demao, Hengmao, Zhengkang, and Yuanfeng, a total of thirteen Qian Zhuang. The amount of the bonds subscribed is 1.75 million yuan. The interest paid by the Continental Bank on the 40% cash guarantee is 6.5% per annum. After receiving the notice from the Continental Bank, the Qian Zhuang, considering the interests of all bond-subscribing banks and Qian Zhuang, convened a general meeting. They all believed that other banknote-issuing banks had not taken such action, so why should the Continental Bank be different? They then elected representatives Ma Wenxiang, Liu Ximeng, Yin Huanzhi, and others to negotiate with Ye Fuxiao, the president of the Continental Bank, demanding that the contract be upheld and that the thirteen Qian Zhuang be paid the</p>
<p>interest of 60,000 yuan. Because they were refused, the Qian Zhuang jointly hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against the Continental Bank and its president, Ye Fuxiao, for breach of contract and payment of interest. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi opened the court for hearing. Lawyer Zhan stated that all the plaintiffs had signed contracts with the defendant to promote the sale of banknotes. In order to ensure the stability of issuance, the Ministry of Finance ordered the banknote-issuing banks to deposit a guarantee deposit with the Central Bank and pay interest on the guarantee deposit. Therefore, the defendant should also pay interest on the guarantee deposit received from the plaintiffs. However, the defendant is using the government's</p>
<p>currency reform as an excuse to cancel the signed bond subscription contracts and stop paying interest. However, currency reform is one thing, and the bond subscription contract is another. How can the currency reform affect the validity of the contract? Moreover, the interest paid by the Central Bank to the defendant is more favorable than the interest paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs. Since the Central Bank has not stopped paying interest on the guarantee deposit paid by the defendant, the defendant cannot stop paying interest to the plaintiffs. The matter is clear. Therefore, the plaintiffs request a judgment that the contract</p>
<p>continues to be valid and that the interest owed by the defendant, up to tomorrow (31st), should be paid immediately, and that the litigation costs should be borne by the defendant. The defendant's lawyer argued that the government's centralized reserve and unified issuance policy constitutes a "special event" as stipulated in the contract. Therefore, the defendant proposes to abandon the contract because, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, in addition to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, new banknotes from other banks with the right to issue banknotes will no longer be issued, and the old banknotes that have been issued will also be gradually recalled. Therefore, the lawyers of both parties argued about whether the currency reform constitutes a "special event" in the contract. The court also believed that this issue requires careful consideration and ordered both parties to withdraw and wait for a postponed hearing.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese in Straits Due to Poverty; One Attempts Suicide by Disembowelment, One by Hanging; Takashima Nijiji's Life May Be Saved, Akiyama Tokisuke Has Already Died</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Takashima Nijiji, 47 years old, from Ishikawa County, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, came to Shanghai in 1923 to run an antique business. He resided in a room on the second floor of the home of Koike Tsukasa at No. 160, Rue Maignan. Due to recent business failures and being pressured by poverty, he suddenly used a kitchen knife to disembowel himself deep in the night of the 28th. It was not until the 29th that the neighbors in the back room heard moaning and, peering through the window, saw blood on the bedding. They urgently reported to the Hino Hospital, which sent a doctor to treat him. After bandaging the 20 cm incision below the navel, they telegraphed the Consulate General Police Department, which sent him to the Fumin Hospital. After a detailed examination, it was discovered that there were also knife wounds on both sides of the neck. Although the neck had been repeatedly cut, the abdominal cavity had not been reached, so there was no danger to his life.</p>
<p>According to the Mainichi Shimbun, Akiyama Tokisuke from Kyoto County, Fukuoka Prefecture, resided at the home of Iho Jutaro in the Zhonghe Building at No. 293, Avenue Edward VII. In August of this year, he served as the supervisor of the Towa-kan construction site. Since October, due to poor capital management, the employer has stopped paying wages, leaving him without food expenses. He then had suicidal thoughts. At 9 AM on the 29th, a Chinese worker, Zhang Zizhong, the watchman of the Towa-kan construction site on Zhabu Road, suddenly discovered a body hanging from a beam in the north corner of the site. He reported it to the Japanese Consulate Police Department, which brought Dr. Tonimiya from Fumin Hospital to examine the scene. The result was that the estimated time of death was more than 30 hours.</p>

<h3>National Sports Basketball Southern Expedition Team to Arrive in Shanghai Soon to Await Passage Abroad; Departure from Shanghai Possible on the 6th or 7th of Next Month; National Sports Likely Unable to Participate in World Games Selection</h3>
<p>The National Sports College basketball team and National Martial Arts Hall's joint Southern Seas travel group has finalized all overseas travel procedures. It has been learned that the group will arrive in Shanghai soon to await passage abroad. The following details were obtained yesterday from Mr. Li Zhenzhong, a member of the team:</p>
<p>National Sports Basketball to Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>According to Li Zhenzhong, the National Sports team's trip to the South Seas is entirely educational in nature. Since the team members will all graduate next summer, this trip can serve as both a tour and a skill exploration, as well as demonstrate the level of domestic basketball technology to overseas Chinese. The group of seven includes team leader Pang Yusen and team members Zhang Changjiang, Zhang Changqing, Gao Changming, Wu Wenzhong, Tang Shikun, and Li Zhenzhong. They are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai before January 5th to await passage abroad, departing on the President Dollar liner no later than the 6th or 7th. Principal Zhang Zhijiang, who has returned from a tour of Europe, is scheduled to arrive in Singapore on January 7th and plans to wait for the entire team to arrive in Singapore to join them on their southern expedition. The team plans to go directly to Singapore without stopping in Hong Kong. It is estimated that there will be four games in Singapore, then on to Malaysia, Java, Penang, and finally the Philippines. The match arrangements along the way will be handled by Principal Zhang, but have not yet been finalized. They are scheduled to leave the Philippines in early March and return directly to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Unable to Participate in World Games Selection</p>
<p>Mr. Li also said that the National Sports team will not be able to participate in the World Games selection, which will be held in Shanghai at the end of January. According to Li, the World Games selection was originally scheduled to take place in mid-March. However, Principal Zhang was in the midst of finalizing the details of the National Sports team's trip to the South Seas, when they were suddenly notified that the selection would be held earlier, at the end of January. In fact, it would be impossible to do both. However, to maintain credibility with overseas Chinese, the trip to the South Seas cannot be cancelled. The Athletic Association, which is in charge of the selection, does not yet have a proper solution. In my opinion, it would be best to hold the preliminary selection at the end of January and then hold the final selection in March. This approach is somewhat biased. I believe that General Secretary Shen will have a satisfactory solution. What I have said is just a personal hope.</p>
<h3>Basketball Team Changes Departure to Beijing to New Year's Day; Table Tennis Team Accompanies; Total of Ten Players in Two Teams; Each Team to Play Three Games in Beijing, Returning on the 5th</h3>
<p>The basketball and table tennis teams organized by the staff of the Shanghai International Radio Station are taking advantage of the New Year's holiday to go on a long-distance expedition to Beijing and also do some sightseeing. They were originally scheduled to depart today, but due to the radio station's busy schedule on New Year's Eve, they were unable to leave. They have had to change their departure to New Year's Day morning, taking the 8:00 AM express train to Beijing. The basketball team will play against the Capital Reporters Team that night. It is said that they will stay in Beijing for four days, lodging at the Lishi Society, and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 5th. The list of players for the two teams is as follows: Team Leader Zhu Ruqing, General Secretary and Table Tennis Team Captain Wu Zhifu, Basketball Team Captain Jiang Kun, Team Members Jiang Peng, Pan Yongfu, Hua Yulin, Jiang Zhensheng, Zhu Ruqing, Zhu Sen, You De, Wang Pu'en.</p>
<h3>Hudong Junior Ball Games to Begin on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Hudong Junior Soccer Competition was scheduled to begin at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, with seven games originally planned. However, due to unfavorable weather, with continuous rain and overcast skies for days, the field became a swamp, making it impossible to play. As a result, all teams agreed to postpone the games. The association has issued a postponement notice, setting the start date for January 1st. The schedule is listed below:</p>

<h3>Little Boy (140)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The little house’s value increased quickly. Soon he was quite satisfied with this investment and planned to use the principal to buy unheard-of treasures. He recorded each deposit. Aunt Guang Sheng allowed him to wait until his savings reached five yuan, and then he could buy eggs. He was overjoyed and ran to the barn, took out the four shiny, large-sized silver dollar coins, and showed them to Naide.</p>
<p>Naide looked at them, expressing extreme envy, and said, "It's a pity I don't have that much, otherwise, combined with my accumulated three yuan, it would be almost enough to buy the violin I've longed for for so long."</p>
<p>"Maybe I can lend you some. I haven't decided how to use my money yet," said, while tossing his silver coins and catching them again with his hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone shouted from behind the warehouse, "Hey, kids, come to the river to see Dunn catch a live, big snake."</p>
<p>"Let's go," said. He casually threw the money into an old grain cleaner and ran off in a puff of smoke, followed by Naide.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Price Attempts to Rise But Falls Instead; Market Sentiment Unsettled; Drop of One Yuan; Four-Day New Year's Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's sentiment attempted to rally but was still thwarted. Chinese merchants quickly filled positions after selling, causing the price to fall after the initial rise, almost approaching the 50-yuan mark. The situation was extremely volatile. Chinese merchants' closing of foreign exchange positions seemed to indicate a weakening trend. In the morning, overseas reports indicated that the British and American silver markets were closed, the Montedri forward silver price was unchanged and rose by 1.77%, the exchange rate was slightly longer, and London spot gold fell by one penny. The Central Bank's listing price revealed that British and American currencies were flat, and the Customs gold unit was unchanged.

HSBC's listing price revealed that British and American currencies were flat and gradually increased. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to become active, gradually pulling up the market. The white silver equalization tax revealed that it was unchanged, with no significant impact. After this, market sentiment was unstable, rising and falling intermittently, but lacking special changes. Later, with market sentiment improving, large investors jointly bought, briefly breaking through the 60-yuan mark. At noon, it was still hovering around the mark. The after-market over-the-counter was depressed. After opening, large investors' selling momentum suddenly increased, and weakness appeared.

<h3>Bank Closing and Collection More Troublesome</h3>

The amount of banknotes issued was over 1.6 million, plus over 400,000 from other ports. The transaction of foreign currency mortgage was over 1.8 million, with over 900,000 new transactions. The bank's collection and settlement was slightly complicated due to the approaching end of the year.

<h3>Securities Market</h3>
<p>**Public Bonds: Major Players Attempt Sophistication, Retail Investors Deceived, Most Bonds Fall, Few Rise**</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange saw quite lively trading. Major short sellers deliberately created confusion, pretending to exit but actually increasing positions to mislead observers. Simultaneously, they entrusted other brokers to sell off, while individual retail investors were uniformly deceived. Since rumors of interest rate cuts spread in the market, confidence has gradually weakened. Furthermore, following the sharp decline in silver prices, financial institutions rushed to convert foreign exchange into local currency, forcing them to sell bonds to compensate. Previously, they bought bonds and sold foreign exchange; now, they are doing the opposite, following the same pattern. The difference in actions caused extreme market volatility. In the afternoon, rumors of Japanese yen transactions further destabilized the market. As predicted the previous day, yesterday's trading was undoubtedly small due to the aforementioned reasons. The future remains turbulent. Yesterday's trading involved three sessions, starting weak but strengthening before a final surge of over one yuan, leading many to believe a rebound was imminent. However, unbeknownst to them, while No. 54 heavily absorbed bonds, they were simultaneously selling off large quantities on the other side, misleading those who further fueled the surge. This could be seen from the second session onwards, where No. 54 immediately began selling off, causing the market price to drop by several jiao (tenths of a yuan) to over one yuan. Selling pressure remained strong during the afternoon session, causing a further decline of about half a yuan. Throughout the day, Nos. 32, 48, and 78 consistently sold off. Buying interest was scattered. As a result, apart from 19, 22, and 96, which performed well, rising five fen (hundredths of a yuan) to four jiao and a half, the rest uniformly fell, ranging from two or three jiao to nine jiao. The total transaction volume was 23,999,000 yuan. A comparison of the price changes is listed below (unit: yuan; transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>**Monthly Yarn and Cotton Delivery Review**</p>
<p>Yarn Price: 200 yuan - Volume: 13,800 bales</p>
<p>Cotton Price: 41.5 yuan - Volume: 85,400 dan (approximately 50 kg)</p>
<p>The Jin Jin Ji brand of yarn for December delivery was launched on July 1st of this year at a price of 169 yuan, followed by 169.7 yuan. Subsequently, due to the unrest in North China, sluggish yarn sales, tight credit, and large-scale selling by Japanese merchants, the pressure was severe. By July 13th, the near-month contract broke the 60-yuan mark, with a low of 165.2 yuan. Later, due to the difficult operating conditions of yarn mills, coupled with hot weather, more and more factories suspended or reduced production, leading to a reduction in output. At the same time, margin calls trended higher, and some speculators actively purchased. Rumors of severe currency problems circulated, causing the market to turn from weak to strong. By July 30th, the price jumped five yuan in one day, and cotton rose 1.3 yuan, reaching a high of 179.7 yuan. The high price hindered actual sales, and customer demand was subdued, causing the market to be controlled. By August 28th, the price had fallen again to [blank] yuan, followed by a long period of sideways movement. By October, margin call increases became more pronounced, and market prices steadily advanced, reaching new highs, breaking through the 1,200 yuan level. Financial institutions and certain entrusted parties eagerly absorbed, rushing in like swarms of bees, causing prices to surge from the 70 yuan level to 198 yuan, with minor fluctuations along the way. On November 4th, the National Government announced that the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were legal tender, further fueling market frenzy. Prices jumped 10 yuan in one session, reaching 204 yuan. At this time, rumors spread in the local market, and profitable longs exited, dropping the price below 191.9 yuan. However, banks, gold merchants, and public bond traders continued to buy, taking a bullish view on margin yarn, absorbing contracts with distant delivery dates in substantial amounts, and consistently refusing to release them. This resulted in an increasing gap between near- and far-month contracts, prompting arbitrage activity. Therefore, although sellers diligently pressured prices and actively delivered goods, arbitrageurs swept them up. In recent days, the price has broken through the 200 yuan level again, reaching 202 yuan. The final session price was 201 yuan, up 3.5 yuan from the previous month. The delivery price for three days was set at 200 yuan, with a remaining balance of 13,800 bales. New goods delivered included 2,000 bales of Kuei Hsing No. 2, 1,00 yuan of Da Fa, 1,400 bales of Jin Jin Ji, 1,050 bales of Shuang Ma, 800 bales of Tian Guan, 500 bales of Xing Shi, 350 bales of Shuang Lu, 100 bales of Di Qiu, 150 bales of Kong Que, 350 bales of Hong Fu, 550 bales of Jin Ta, 300 bales of San Xing, and 1,000 bales of Qi Qiu, totaling 9,500 bales. The rest were self-delivered. The China Cotton Corporation received 2,000 bales, a certain company received 5,500 bales, and arbitrageurs accounted for the majority. The brokers' identification numbers and bale amounts for both delivery and receiving parties are listed below.</p>
<p>Delivery Quantity of Margin Yarn Sellers</p>
<p>Receiving Quantity of Margin Yarn Buyers</p>
<p>The margin cotton contract for December delivery was launched on July 1st of this year at a price of 31.4 yuan, rising slightly to 31.75 yuan. At this time, Shanghai yarn mills suspended production, cotton stocks accumulated, consumption was weak, and sentiment was fearful. By July 13th, the low price was 31.05 yuan. Subsequently, due to poor weather and severe flooding in the north, cotton fields were inundated, causing significant damage. At the same time, the yarn market rose, and margin call increases were sharp. By July 30th, the price was 34.95 yuan. In August, the U.S. cotton loan was changed from 1.2 jiao to 9 fen, causing global market volatility and a decline in the cotton industry, breaking through the 32 yuan level. During September and October, rumors spread in the margin call market, the gold market surged, and speculators rushed in like a tide. The intensity of the upward trend was unprecedented, surging directly to 40 yuan. After the announcement of the currency reform on November 4th, the price jumped 3 yuan in one day. Although there were ups and downs along the way, the overall trend was upward. In recent days, due to U.S. and Japanese merchants taking delivery, the market was tight, reaching a peak of 43 yuan. Subsequently, the price retreated due to stagnant export trade. The final session price was 41.35 yuan, up 1.7 yuan from the previous month. The remaining balance was 85,400 dan. The delivery price for three days was set at 41.5 yuan. The goods included Huo Ji Tong Hua Shaanxi [blank] Bao and other cotton. The brokers' identification numbers and quantities for both delivery and receiving parties are listed below.</p>

<p>**Yarn Sales Remain Smooth, Cotton Demand Stagnant**</p>
<p>The yarn and standard cotton market was closed for meetings due to the end-of-month delivery procedures, and everyone was busy with collections and payments. However, current yarn merchants still went to the market to do business, and the market was stable. Customer demand was maintained, and financial circles were optimistic, and they did not relax the goods they had pulled in. US cotton was flat, Indian cotton was stopped in the market, and 515 bales of present-day yarn were transacted. The market was the same as the previous day, and more than 1,000 bales were transacted in the afternoon, for a total of 2,000 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton margin market was closed yesterday for delivery, and demand for present-day cotton from factories also ceased. 40 bales of Yuyao cotton and 250 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock, and the amount to be opened is as follows:</p>
<p>**Indian Cotton Market is Depressed**</p>
<p>Although the spot market in Mumbai was slow last week, the market was depressed. Due to the impact of arriving goods, the price difference became greater. In the past three weeks, Pingguoer fell by 11 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuo Creek fell by 3 rupees. Europe bought new special cotton in Galati, and Lancashire also had intentions, while Japan was very quiet. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousands of bales).</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>**Ke Xian Rice Arrives in Force, Sales are Lackluster**</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market saw a surge in arrivals, with whole shipments from Anqing, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Shaoxing arriving in port. However, sales were limited to local buyers, further weakening the market. Consequently, sellers were willing to lower prices to offload their stocks, and prices fell slightly by three to five fen. Newly arrived Anqing machine-milled rice was sold out due to the price cut. Throughout the day, 538 bags of Gan rice, 1,117 bags of Anqing rice, 470 bags of Yongshao rice, 335 bags of Wenzhou rice, and 100 bags of Han rice were sold. Only 50 bags of foreign rice, 44 grade broken rice, were sold, all to local buyers. Looking ahead, arrivals are expected to continue unabated, and inventories are sufficient. With prices already falling downstream, Ke Xian rice is also expected to trend towards parity.</p>
<p>**Bo Dao (Thin Rice) Bag Volume Reaches 4-5,000 Bags**</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of the various gangs totaled 40 odd companies (totaling more than 8,000 shi). In addition, sales remained sluggish. The price of thick and early soft rice continued to fall by five fen to one jiao. Yesterday, Bo Dao bag orders coincided with shifts, and due to ship positions, there was a lot of movement, about 4-5,000 bags, so the Bo Dao market was uniquely high at five fen. Du Yang Jian's (a type of rice) sales turned sluggish, and also fatigued by several fen. Yin Yuan also showed softness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 51 or 52 downstream sources in He Xia. Market shipments were sluggish, and Bai Geng transactions were sluggish. Early Bo Dao was also sluggish. Yang Fu Jian and Bai Yuan, etc., had flat sales. Bai Geng was down a jiao or two, and early rice followed down a jiao. The price of Bo Dao Bai Yuan was down by a small jiao, and the price of Yang Fu Jian was down several fen. Prices for other goods were also fatigued.</p>
<p>**Yang Zhuang Sesame Trends Soft**</p>
<p>Today, the Yang Zhuang sesame market is flat, and buyers and sellers are watching because it is the end of the lunar year. Those with goods are afraid that there will be special changes in the market situation at the beginning of the year, so they lower prices to sell. Yesterday and the day before, 400 tons were traded at a price of 11.8 yuan. Yesterday, another 300 tons were traded at a price of 11.75 yuan, all of which were contracted for delivery in January and February. The changes in the overall trend depend on the opening of the new year. The present-day hairy flax also softened, leading to no transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>**Year-End Silk Prices Remain Stable**</p>
<p>As the end of the lunar year approaches, all industries at home and abroad are busy with the end of the year's accounts, so the silk market is even more quiet. However, the market price is still stable, as in the past week. Yesterday, Mitsui, Reina, and others slightly improved their purchase price of 78 shares of white factory, 20?22, at 780 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>**Citibank Black Iron Sheet Speculators Absorb**</p>
<p>The arrival of Citibank black iron sheets has recently been limited, and the high pricing has led to fewer arrivals and thin inventories. Customers have searched for a total of 1,500 to 1,600 dan in the past two days, and the market is far more higher than before. At present, the thick goods of the Yellow Eagle brand are estimated at 9.75 yuan per dan, the thin goods are 11.5 yuan, the thick goods of the Butterfly brand are estimated at 9.65 yuan per dan, and the thin goods are estimated at 11.4 yuan. The price of a kind of wild chicken size goods is 11 yuan per dan, which is a rise of three to four jiao compared with the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>**Guangdong Sugar Transactions Decrease, Price Does Not Fluctuate**</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight easing of customs gold, and the trend turned loose. The guild set the price of 24 coarse sand white present goods at 22.6 yuan, but no transaction was made. Re-exported goods were 7.3 yuan, with a slight drawdown, 5 fen less. The price of Dong Chi remained unchanged, and the price of Dong Bai was called down by 5 fen to 1 jiao. No. 8 present goods were 22.2 yuan, and re-exported goods were 7.2 yuan. No. 9 was 21.9 yuan, and re-exported goods were 6.9 yuan, but there were no transactions. The prices of the factory's Jin Bai and Zhen Ji No. 1 were 21.5 yuan, without fluctuation.

<p>**China's Tea Industry (4)**</p>
<p>*Yi Bai*</p>
<p>In Jiangxi Province, with the exception of the Zhen Zhi Company, which uses machinery, all green tea is roasted by hand, and the method is roughly similar to that of Anhui and Zhejiang. The Jiangxi Tea Zhen Zhi Co., Ltd. is one of the few tea factories in China. It was established in the fourth year of the Republic of China with a capital of 130,000 yuan. It is located in Taixiang, east of Xiushui City, and has its own tea garden of 2,595 mu. The machinery used for kneading tea was originally nine Jacprons Rapid Roller type kneading machines manufactured by Japan. Subsequently, due to poor performance, four Indian-style tea kneading machines were purchased from the United Kingdom. However, the tea roasting utensils still use the old method of roasting.</p>
<p>(Fujian) Fujian produces a lot of tea, and its products are sold in Southeast Asia. However, due to the import of Taiwanese white tea to Shantou and other ports, the Chinese tea market in Southeast Asia has been encroached upon, and it has been decreasing year by year. The tea making methods in Fujian are all old-fashioned manual methods, the same as those in Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(Hunan and Hubei) The number of tea-producing families in the two lakes is the highest in the country. In the past, more than 400,000 boxes were exported every year. Recently, because the tea-producing areas in Hunan and Hubei have been occupied by the communist bandits, and because of tight money and sluggish exports, the tea industry has plummeted. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, 610,000 dan of Chinese tea were exported from Hankou, but by the 19th year, it had fallen to 310,000 dan. There are four brick tea factories in Hankou, three of which are owned by Russian merchants and one by Chinese merchants. Later, because the Russian merchant factories dumped Soviet tea and the Soviet Union restricted Chinese tea, one factory was closed and one was sold off in the 11th year of the [blank]. The Chinese Commercial Brick Factory is an outstanding brick tea factory in China. It was founded in the 32nd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty with a capital of 500,000 yuan. The products include rice brick tea, red brick tea, and green brick tea. Its quality is relatively good. Unfortunately, it was flooded during the great flood in 1932, causing great damage. Although it was restored later, it also encountered the Sino-Japanese Incident and economic panic, so it is still in a critical situation.</p>
<p>(Jiangsu) Jiangsu tea has suffered a devastating blow from competition with Japanese tea in recent years. According to a survey report, there are a total of 85 tea factories in the province. However, the largest capital is only 15,000 yuan, and only 14 companies have it. The scale is very small, and production is carried out in handicraft mode. (The tea conditions in each province are based on the economic yearbook of the Ministry of Industry)</p>
<p>From this point of view, Chinese tea should not be able to compete with emerging tea-producing countries in the world. For example, China's tea-making machines still need to be purchased from Japan and India, which are backward tea-producing countries. There is no improvement. In addition, the quantity of machines purchased from backward countries is negligible, which is the biggest proof that Chinese tea cannot be developed. This situation is like the Sino-Japanese War in Gubeikou, where China fought against Japan's 20th-century airplanes and tanks with 18th-century broadswords. As a result, China was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>5. Preliminary Views on the Improvement Plan of Chinese Tea Production and Sales</p>
<p>Although Chinese tea has been competed by emerging tea-producing countries and is in a desperate situation, China is still the kingdom of tea-producing countries in the world in terms of quantity. According to the tea industry in the economics dictionary published by the Japanese Reform Agency: in 1928, the total world tea production was 4,700,100 tons, and China accounted for 6% and 7% of its 3 million tons. According to the survey of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China, the annual output of Chinese tea is 7.9 million city dans. According to the total production of tea-producing countries in the world (excluding China) in 1933, 4,090,495 hectoliters, which is equivalent to 8,180,990 city dans, China's output accounts for more than 49% of the world's output. Since China has such a huge amount of tea production, if it can scientifically improve its quality and make its transportation and sales mechanism sound, then there is no reason for Chinese tea to decline. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>First, the urgent need for improvement on the tea industry itself</p>
<p>A. Tea planting mountains should be improved</p>
<p>Chinese farmers are often conservative. According to the "Shishi News" on September 14th of this year: "The tea-producing area in Longjing, Hangzhou, covers an area of more than 100 mu and produces more than 100 dan every year. - Recently, inchworms have been found, which are extremely harmful and have been ineffective in killing them. The green leaves on all the tea trees in Longjing have been eaten, leaving only dead branches standing, like after a fire. The spread is so fast that the nearby Wengjiashan and Yangjiashan areas have been affected, and the area affected by the insect disaster has extended to about 1,000 mu. Production is hopeless next year." This situation is caused by the neglect of scientific management by tea planters. According to a letter from the Shanghai Tea Association to the National Economic Commission, in the item "Improvement of Production," it is briefly stated that the production of tea in Xiushui County and/or [blank] is extremely [blank]. During the most prosperous period of the year, the annual output was 180,000 boxes, but now it is less than 10,000 boxes, because the tea land has been left barren due to sluggish exports. It is urgent to provide relief. The method of relief is: loosening the soil, weeding, replanting, and fertilizing. For example, every autumn, dig up the soil in the tea planting mountains, remove weeds, and apply a little fertilizer, such as leaf fertilizer and soybean cake. Remove old tea trees and replant new ones. As for insect pests, drugs that do not harm the tea trees can be used to repel them.</p>
<p>B. Tea making technology should be modernized and industrialized</p>
<p>At present, Chinese tea production is still done by hand, which is not suitable for the 20th century. Because Chinese tea relies on sunlight exposure, it often has a bad smell. Even unscientific iron pot roasting is difficult to obtain good tea flavor. If all the production tools of Chinese tea are replaced by modern machines, the absorption of tea moisture can be limited to a certain extent, and the color and taste of tea can be retained to a certain extent. There is no phenomenon of excessive fermentation or uneven color and taste. The reason why tea from India, Japan, and Ceylon can gain market share is that the modernization and industrialization of tea production. What should be avoided most is that Chinese tea merchants value short-term benefits and forget permanent interests. For example, tea leaves are mixed with tea stems, artificial colors are dyed in the tea, or water is splashed into the tea leaves. Regarding tea containing moisture, the Ministry of Industry has recently issued an order to ban the sale of all raw tea containing more than 45% moisture. However, it is best for tea merchants to realize this themselves. This is no different from a moth seeing fire as light, but in reality, it is suicide. The quality of Chinese tea is superior to that of the rest of the world due to the relationship between the [blank] of the land, as mentioned above. Therefore, Chinese tea can still be sold to tea-producing countries such as India and Japan. The high-quality tea in these tea-producing countries still needs to be mixed with Chinese tea. If Chinese tea makers can implement large-scale modern industrialization with a long-term vision, the future of Chinese tea will still be infinitely bright. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Eating in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>That's why Shanghai has all kinds of tastes. Now let's talk about restaurants.</p>
<p>There are tropical Indian restaurants and frigid Russian restaurants. Oriental cuisine and Western white cuisine are all available.</p>
<p>As for domestic restaurants, there are even more. Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Fujian, Hangzhou, Su Bang, and Yang Bang, there are too many to count. In particular, Guangdong restaurants, Hui restaurants, Ningbo gangs and Wuxi gangs, and local restaurants are everywhere. In addition, there are Qingzhen sects and Buddhist vegetarian restaurants. Some people say that only rich people can afford to eat in these restaurants. That's right. But peddlers and pawns also have a place to enjoy themselves, because in Shanghai, in the slums, there are always a few small restaurants on every street that sell cheap dishes. To be more economical, beggars can also taste delicious food for two or three cents. However, what they taste is not a bowl of dishes, but the leftovers from big restaurants pieced together.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Four-Gilled Perch</h3>
<p>— Jia Chengsheng</p>
<p>Time flies like running water. In the blink of an eye, it's mid-winter again. In this cold and snowy weather, the famous Songjiang four-gilled perch has become a seasonal food and a treasure for banquets.</p>
<p>Songjiang perch does not have any special taste, but it has been handed down to this day because it has been sung by poets.</p>
<p>Although there is more than one area in Songjiang that produces perch, perch is divided into three-gilled and four-gilled, with the four-gilled being more valuable. It is produced in a pool of clear water under Xiuye Bridge in Songcheng, and the output is the least. Although the output of other places is large, they are all three-gilled.</p>
<p>When perch first came on the market, four-gilled sold for one yuan a catty, and three-gilled can get two to three catties, the cheapest being four catties for one yuan.</p>
<p>There is no fixed price for eating a hot pot of perch in a restaurant in Songjiang City. It depends on how many people eat. For example, if four people eat, two tails per person, with three or four other foods, such as chicken slices, meat slices, and winter bamboo shoots, the initial market price is about 1.6 yuan, and after a long time, it will be 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>If you need perch for a family banquet, you must order it from the fish shop one or two days in advance, otherwise it will not be available at that time, because four-gilled perch is only produced under Xiuye Bridge, and the daily supply is less than the demand.</p>
<p>Perch dies when it is out of the water, and it has the same characteristics as [blank] fish, so it is difficult to carry to other places. This may be one of the reasons why it is so valuable. If there is train transportation between Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, you can arrive in the morning and afternoon, and many people come to buy it. The way to carry it is to put the fish in bran skin to keep it fresh and not to spoil the taste.</p>
<p>The taste of perch lies in its freshness and tenderness, so its eating method must be raw, just like eating pheasant meat, and the main cooking method must be accompanied by chicken soup and winter bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>Pudong in Shanghai also produces perch, and the output is very large, but they are three-gilled, which are regarded as ordinary things in the market, and the price is also cheap. In fact, the freshness and tenderness are better than Songjiang perch, and those who like fresh food can also try it.</p>
<h3>One Year, One Settlement</h3>

<h3>Dongshan Mutton</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>It's the season for mutton to be on the market again. On every street, in front of small tea houses and noodle shops, you can see mutton vendors parked. Green, dried lotus leaves loosely cover slices of white meat. A serving costs three or four hundred coppers. Go to a noodle shop for a bowl of plain noodles, or to a tea house for fifty coppers worth of old wheat wine. Put your feet up, take a sip of wine, pick up a slice of meat with your fingers, and leisurely chat with people. During this time of year, if you don't indulge in this, you're considered unsophisticated.</p>
<h3>Chapter 22: A Knight's Words Move Painted Lips, a Fair Maiden Plots, False Affection Startles a Jade Wrist, a Suffering Woman Flees Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Mrs. Zhou said, "Ms. Zhu, if you don't dare to go home, I have an idea. You can move upstairs and live in the room next to Mrs. Lan. No matter what, don't come out. If he doesn't ask us for you, we'll demand an explanation from him. If he comes to find us, that's even better. We'll throw him out of this hotel, and then it's done. You just hide, even if the sky falls, there's a roof to hold it up. What are you afraid of?" Yueying leaned against a pillar in the hall, twisting a corner of her clothing in her hand and biting it with her mouth. She lowered her head, looking at her toes, pondering this problem. Mrs. Liu pushed her, saying, "Why are you so excessively timid? With so many of us helping you, what are you afraid of? If you live next to Mrs. Lan, he'll find Mrs. Lan first if he comes looking for you. Mrs. Lan can send him away. In broad daylight, under the bright sky, no one can eat a person alive. Even if he does find you, what can he do to you? You have to think more clearly. What abilities does that man named Jia have? Didn't you see us throw teapots at him earlier? He ran away frantically." As Mrs. Liu spoke, she took Yueying's hand and gave it to Mrs. Lan. Mrs. Lan led her upstairs, smiling and whispering, "Who knew that the person sobbing and crying last night was you? Your suffering is truly enough for anyone to bear. No wonder you cried." She held Yueying's hand and walked upstairs, chattering incessantly. However, Wang Beihai, who was watching from downstairs, was mesmerized. He pressed his hands on the table, half-raised his body, neither standing nor sitting, just staring at the top of the stairs. Only when Yueying had entered the room did he turn his head, only to see Jia Duocai walking in from outside with a stern face and swaying gait. He seemed to have thought of something at the entrance screen, and paused for a moment. Later, seeing the group of older women in the reception hall crowding into the living room, he thought it was an opportunity and immediately ran towards his own room. Wang Beihai, standing to one side, couldn't help but laugh and call out, "Too late, too late!" Jia Duocai, hearing this strange remark behind him, turned to look at Beihai. Beihai also straightened his face and said to a passing tea server, "Speak justly. That way is open." This sentence was clearly directed at Jia Duocai, with a hint of challenge. (386)</p>
<p>Ten. A nose can smell bad odors. What if...?</p>
<p>Mutton's main source is a village south of Daishui called Wujia Village. Dozens of families in the village rely on sheep for a living. Except in winter, Dongshan sheep farmers shear wool; in winter, they carry mutton. Their livelihood depends on sheep. Few people raise sheep, but these days, dozens of large merino sheep are slaughtered in the village every day. They come from sheep traders from southern Zhejiang and the Taihu River estuaries. One boatload is sold off, and another arrives at the village.</p>
<p>Each mutton vendor can make three or four hundred yuan in a winter. The business is so large because they allow credit. If you go to the market every day, they'll keep a tab for you. So some households have debts of ten or so yuan by the end of the year. Some even avoid going to the market to evade their mutton debt. So on New Year's Eve, there are scenes of people trying to collect mutton debts, stripping clothes, and blocking doors.</p>
<p>Carrying mutton is the most laborious. They slaughter during the day and set off with their loads at dawn. The farthest they go is across Xiajiao Ridge to Baisha, north of the town. To get to the back of our mountain, they have to pass through Ganshan Ridge, Tangshou Ridge, and reach Yangwan Village, climbing mountains and crossing ridges with heavy loads over these rugged hills and through many villages.</p>
<p>It is said that their method of cooking mutton using fire sounds very strange. They only use a stove of rice straw, simmering the mutton in a pot. At dawn, they remove the bones, transfer the meat to the carrying tray, and set off with it.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Steamed Pork with Wine Lees</h3>
<p>— Jiao Xin</p>
<p>Our hometown, Changzhou, can be said to produce nothing special. The bamboo combs, once famous throughout the country, are now declining because the manufacturers stick to old methods and are resistant to change. Moreover, in recent years, women have been cutting off their long hair, so bamboo combs are not as necessary as before.</p>
<p>However, there is one food item that goes unnoticed – steamed pork with wine lees – which is now highly praised by everyone. Locals certainly like it, and people from other places who have tasted it will always remember and praise it. Every Lunar New Year, it is an essential delicacy for every household. I heard that someone in Shanghai has already started selling it this year, but because of the ineffective publicity, not many people know about it. I am now writing down its method below to inform those from other places who want to eat it again but do not know how it is made.</p>
<p>Buy a piece of streaky pork from the butcher, cut it into four-inch squares, put it in a pot and add soy sauce and wine (a little, to remove the fishy smell) and boil until cooked. Remove it, let it cool, and then cut it into thin slices of two inches. Apply a little of the coloring sold in soy sauce shops to the skin of the pork (to give it a reddish color, you can skip this step). Place the pork skin down in a coarse rice bowl, and then cover it with aged wine lees (available at distilleries. Before using the lees, stir-fry them slightly in a pot, remove the hard chunks, and add sugar and soy sauce and other seasonings). Add a slice of ginger and a scallion knot on top of the lees, and steam over water four or five times. When eating, pour it into a serving bowl, so that the pork is on top and the lees are on the bottom.</p>
<p>The method of making steamed pork with wine lees is not difficult, and the cost is not expensive. For one yuan, you can make five or six bowls. Its charm lies in its richness without being greasy, its fragrant and rich aroma, and its tenderness like tofu. Even people who don't usually eat fatty meat can eat a slice or two.</p>
<h3>Nourishment for the Common People</h3>
<p>As the season turns to winter, very affordable nourishing foods become popular as a way for ordinary people to replenish their bodies. Besides preparing them as common side dishes, such as bagged egg, steamed egg, egg dumplings, and egg skin, eating one or two eggs beaten into rice porridge or mixed with white sugar every morning has a considerable nourishing effect on the body.</p>
<p>However, besides the above methods of eating, there is also a method of artificial cultivation, and once cultivated, its nourishing effect is even greater. Prepare fifty or sixty eggs and red dates each. Place each egg inside a red date and bury them separately in the soil on the day of the Winter Solstice (each one must be buried individually). Wait until the day of the Spring Equinox, then dig them out. Take one or two each day with boiled water, which has the effect of replenishing essence and benefiting the body.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Three-Snake Stew</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>It is now deep winter, which is also the season for Cantonese people to eat three-snake stew. The Cantonese restaurants on North Sichuan Road slaughter large snakes and hang the snake skins in glass window cabinets as signs. Countless pedestrians crane their necks every day to look inside, so at this time and place, you can know what is going on. I eat snake three or four times a year, so I know quite a bit about the taste, and the responsibility of introducing it is unavoidable.</p>
<p>When did eating snake start? How did it develop? What is the reason? Forgive me for not having a historical interest, so I cannot clearly research it. I only ate it because I was greedy, following other people. That was more than ten years ago, in our hometown... Guangdong. The so-called three snakes are three kinds of snakes called "golden leg band," "over-tree banyan," and "finger snapper." Why these three kinds of snakes are mixed together to eat, I also don't understand. In fact, it's not necessarily that these three kinds of snakes have to be combined to be delicious, because their tastes are not different at all. As for whether this is more beneficial to the body, it's a bit mystical.</p>
<p>The cooking method for snake, according to my experience, is always the same. The snake is slaughtered, the skin is removed, and then the meat and skin are put into a pot and boiled until cooked. Then it is taken out and shredded like eel, and the skin is also cut into thin strips (some methods don't use the skin, but I think the skin mixed in with the meat strips has a special flavor, because the skin curls up when cooked, like eating snail meat, which is crisp). Then it is mixed with civet cat, hawk, abalone, shiitake mushrooms, pig tongue, etc., which are cut or shredded, and put into a pot together and simmered for two or three hours, then it can be eaten. Snake meat is already very fresh and sweet, and with the addition of so many meats and vegetables, it tastes even more delicious, rich, smooth, and palatable. Because so many things are mixed together, the true taste of the snake is actually not easy to distinguish. Even the snake meat strips must be carefully identified to be seen. I think this pot of meat stew would be very good even without snake meat in it. It is said that snake bile is most beneficial to the human body (whether this is true remains to be investigated), so when slaughtering the snake, the gallbladder is carefully extracted first, and then the bile is mixed into the wine, which is called "snake bile wine." It has a slight cool taste when you drink it, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>It is said that snake scales and bones are poisonous, and it is not fun to eat them by mistake, so when shredding the snake meat, you have to be very careful. This work is probably not very difficult, as we have never heard of any accidents happening because of this. It is also said by those who are experienced in eating snake that it is forbidden to have sexual relations after eating snake, otherwise the children born will grow skin like snake scales. So whenever eating snake, you will always hear such words: "Behave yourself tonight, be careful of raising a child with snake scales." Whether this statement is superstitious, I do not know, because there has been no experimental report. However, this matter is always inappropriate after being drunk and full, and perhaps the intention of the elders lies in this.</p>

<h3>The Year's Summary</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>1935 will soon become a page in history. Here I will list a few major events that happened in the world and in China this year as a summary of the year.</p>
<p>The most shocking event in the world this year was the East African War. In the development of this war, one side, the aggressor, unleashed its ambition to swallow the weak, while the other side, the oppressed, insisted on its determination to resist power. On the other hand, Britain and France first implemented sanctions against Italy, and then advocated auctioning off Abyssinia. Currently, the war between the two countries is still in a stalemate, and the resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian issue in the future is unlikely to be achieved by any peaceful solution.</p>
<p>Secondly, the naval conference currently being held in London is also worth mentioning. The holding of this conference is only to do what one can, and there is little hope of success. The naval competition between Britain, the United States, and Japan has become increasingly acute, and compromise is by no means easy. However, the success or failure of this conference is of great importance to the Far Eastern issue. As the center of the Far Eastern issue, China has a need to pay full attention.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country, in this year, external pressure has only aggravated our difficulties. The twenty-two counties of eastern Hebei have been controlled by traitors, and the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar have also formed a disguised autonomous region. Recently, there has been a rumor of Inner Mongolia declaring independence, and the news of the loss of Guyuan. All of these can ruin the country's vitality. Therefore, the work of saving the country and preserving its existence in the future cannot be shouldered solely by the national people, I fear there will be no day to save the national fortunes.</p>
<p>Looking at the above, the world in 1935 was a time when the strong intensified the seizure of colonies. This phenomenon is the result of the development of imperialism. Now that 1935 is about to end, what follows is the crisis-ridden 1936. The future of the world will enter a great era in history. In this era, the iron hooves of the great powers will inevitably extend outwards with even less regard, in order to fulfill their desire to slaughter the weak. Not to mention anything else, the situation in the Pacific may stir up huge waves. Although our country can support the past this year, the difficulties in coping with future disasters will be a hundred times greater than today.</p>
<h3>Madman</h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>When A-Qiang, who was ten years old, returned from the fields carrying a bamboo basket and some weeds, countless frightening shadows surged in his young heart. It was not his biological father's ferocity when he was mad, biting him with teeth that seemed like the mud of the fields, a face that was yellow-black and covered with countless wrinkles. The strange, intense convulsions whenever he jumped up, and the deeply sunken eyes, accustomed to hunger, revealed a terrible, cruel light. The high, hunched shoulders and slightly hunched back were brought back from the mines of Southeast Asia, as if they had long lost his life's vitality. But when he was mad, he would rouse himself and desperately beat his wife and A-Qiang, like a wounded, angry horse, charging blindly at everything that blocked him.</p>
<p>A-Qiang had just returned to the gate of his ancient home. He stepped stealthily, in fact, the little boy's heart was beating terribly, he was afraid of encountering his mad father. But at this moment, his mother was emitting a mournful cry of grief from inside the house. A-Qiang's heart jumped. He didn't dare to run in. His heart knew that this was another of his father's mad tricks. But at this time? The sound of beating and scolding came from the house:</p>
<p>"Damn it, you dare scold me, huh! I'll kill you, what are you? You're a useless stupid pig... huh! I'll kill you! See if you dare scold me..."</p>
<p>His father's roaring voice, followed by the sound of a powerful leg thudding. His mother struggled up and cried out piteously. She moaned in pain:</p>
<p>"Kill me, I don't want to live anymore, I've suffered enough. Heaven! You heartless devil, it's been fourteen years since I came to your house. You went to Southeast Asia for four or five years, and came back like this, mad? You're pretending to be mad! You, you pest, you'll dream of selling all the fields in the family, you don't want to farm, so you let that ghostly woman trick you into going to Southeast Asia. You come back home after four or five years and turn into a mad dog, asking for money every day. Who has the money to support you, you devil, and you're as fierce as a wolf. May Heaven kill you, may lightning strike you, may you die a bad death!"</p>
<p>When A-Qiang timidly ran into the house, he looked in from the corridor into the dark room, a face covered with tears, a haggard and pitiful appearance. Her long hair was pulled apart by his father and was very disheveled. She leaned against the pillar of the old wedding bed as if she had no more life, panting and muttering non-stop. She glared at her husband, who was clenching his teeth, bracing his waist, angrily preparing to hit her again, but when she finished scolding, he laughed grotesquely:</p>
<p>"You shameless ugly woman, you dare to argue? You know, five years ago, my mother died, that's why I sold the land to hold a funeral and pay off some debts. When there was no other way, I did those hateful ×× things, and that's how I met her. She is a woman, a woman with talent, not like you, a stupid pig who doesn't understand anything? Stupid pig! You know, I fled to Southeast Asia to do hard labor for my life. I hid in the mines for more than four years, without earning a single copper coin, and was also whipped by those devils. Ah, look at my back, I'm a hunchback! Look at my shoulders, they're hunched up! This is..." At this point, he suddenly laughed madly, waving his hands, jumping up, clenching his teeth, and roaring: "So, you don't love me anymore? You shameless ugly woman, you're learning from others to have free love! No! You stole a man, you stole a man and that's why you dare scold me like this. You, I went to Southeast Asia for four or five years, and you raised a ten-year-old bastard: A-Qiang, this wild boy, is not yours..."</p>
<p>He gripped his fists madly, jumped in front of her face and roared:</p>
<p>"Get out of here, this is my house, this is my home, go, go, I don't want anything now, just consider that the world has abandoned me. I have no work, Southeast Asia, my hometown, there is no work for me to do, but, I want to drink, I want my freedom, but you don't give me money, are you telling me to die? Didn't you get two or three dimes yesterday from carrying bricks? Where did you take them? Tell me!"</p>
<p>She stood up angrily. She wanted to run away, but he grabbed her with one hand and pushed her and shook her as if he wanted to take a bite. She cried out again, she rushed into his arms and charged wildly, both of them were fighting desperately; but he was stronger, he hugged her neck tightly. He was looking for a kitchen knife while shouting:</p>
<p>"I'm going to use force to chop you to death, chop you to death, you..."</p>
<p>A-Qiang saw this, was startled, and ran out, shouting in terror:</p>
<p>"Help! Dad is going to kill Mom with a knife! Help!..."</p>
<p>After a while, when several neighbors ran into their house, the room was already quiet. He and she were snuggling together, panting, and shedding tears, crying painfully as if they had not been mad...</p>

<h3>Cattle Market</h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>The morning sun climbed to the peak of Cock's Comb Ridge, spitting out a quiet and gentle long tongue, lightly licking the town's towering, thin earth fort. The open space had already begun to fill with people, and the cattle market began. Farmers used trembling, loud voices, shouting at the cattle, passing through the frozen villages, through the barren grasslands, and finally lazily stepping into the town's bleak and dirty main street.</p>
<p>The main street was full of loneliness and cold, and the cattle market was built at the eastern end. The so-called market was a desolate open space, surrounded by some dilapidated fences, on which a few strands of warm sunlight hung tenderly at this time. And under the sunlight, like cow dung, a pile of black crowds was crowded, holding dry tobacco pipes in their hands, talking loudly and indignantly about harvests, market prices, and taxes. The empty and quiet cattle market was filled with smoke, shouts, and roars.</p>
<p>It was ten o'clock. It was the time for the market to open. Uncle Tianfu, the market agent who was also a broker (Note 1), suddenly flew in from somewhere and appeared before the crowd. He was a fat middle-aged man with a "funny spirit," with an odious red nose. As long as his red nose flashed in people's eyes, whoever would recognize him in the midst of thousands of troops and horses: This was Uncle Tianfu's red nose. He stepped over with very generous steps, a gentle smile floating on his face, and a large group of buyers silently followed behind him, touring every corner. He would pat the buttocks of the cattle for his sacred duty, twist their noses, and open their mouths to count their teeth, so they would see the age and value of these cattle.</p>
<p>For the sake of their strategy, the buyers never dared to show satisfaction to the other party. Whenever the agent Uncle Tianfu finished patting a cow's butt or counting its teeth, and said in an inquiring tone, "How about this one?"</p>
<p>They always expressed dissatisfaction, or deliberately shook their heads, but secretly thought, "This is not bad!" But after a while, they would say in an indifferent attitude: "What's the price?"</p>
<p>Uncle Tianfu smiled gently, and beckoned to the cow owner. The cow owner ran over from the crowd, his face glowing with sweat. Uncle Tianfu patted the cow's butt again, and congratulated cheerfully, "Brother Huang Si, this time you're finally going to start the market!"</p>
<p>The one called Huang Si smiled politely and stood straight, but was secretly estimating whether the other party was really sincere in wanting to complete this transaction with him. The other party showed an indifferent attitude, briefly asked him some questions about the cow's life, habits, and labor capacity, and then brought up the price.</p>
<p>The cow owner not only blew a horn for his own cow, for example: "Hey, you see it's a skinny cow, but it has driven fifty fields of millet a day!" Deliberately raising the price a little. The buyer frowned and walked away indifferently, intentionally or unintentionally patting the butt of another cow. At this time, Uncle Tianfu was so frightened that even his red nose turned green, and he followed in a hurry: "How about it?"</p>
<p>The buyer shook his head and shouted angrily, "Damn it! What kind of stuff is this? Worth such a big price!"</p>
<p>"Then you?"</p>
<p>"This!" The buyer stretched out his finger, flicked it lightly in the sun, and walked away.</p>
<p>Uncle Tianfu angrily complained to the cow owner, pointing out that the cow was so old that it could only be dragged into the central stove (Note 2), and after exploring the actual price, ran to find the owner, and after much running and compromise, the goods were finally traded, and Uncle Tianfu took out a red cloth strip from his pocket and tied it to the cow's horn to indicate that it had a new owner, and the cow owner and the buyer smiled and went to the town to drink three cups of wine, which was the customary "transaction" wine. Uncle Tianfu, having received his due amount of compensation, also left to do his other business.</p>
<p>When the sun moved past the middle, the cattle that had not found a new owner were loudly shouted and driven away from the town, passing through the desolate grassland and heading towards the frozen village.</p>
<p>The cattle market's gate was tightly closed, and the town was again filled with desolation and emptiness, only the cold northwest wind roared on the thin earth fort.</p>
<p>Note 1: Broker means public person.</p>
<p>Note 2: Cattle stove is a southern dialect, meaning slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>Opening "New Spring"</p>
<p>Plum blossoms bloom on Shouling, heralding early spring. Her graceful posture is particularly charming. One only sees. Skirts and clogs, hand in hand, go together. Seeking fragrance and competing in beauty, colors are fresh and new. Noble red and green, face like jade. Simple and elegant, a beauty of the nation. Poets compete to praise her gorgeous beauty. Lyricists describe her in poems. In the past, swallows nested in the halls of the Wang and Xie families. Today, they are commonly seen everywhere. Fragrant snow is abundant on the Shanghai coast. Ice soul and jade bones, green curtains and dust. Dancing smoke and willow leaves in the depths. Light moon and cold clouds are truly precious. Sparse shadows and fences, a recluse is hidden. A furnace of incense, curling lightly and evenly. Branches cross fake rocks, becoming friends. Not waiting for the wind to blow, fragrance naturally arrives. Silent and detached, especially suitable for the moon. Lonely cold nights are full of spirit. Three points are not inferior to the spring snow. A trace of fragrance remains, a winter scene. And also see. Songs and music fill the night, people talking loudly. But it turns out. The earth returns to spring, gongs and drums vibrate. The shadow of the red apricot is late, the sun turns bright. Therefore it is. Welcoming spring everywhere, expressing joy. Crows fight for trees, voices noisy. Already for. Beautiful days and gentle breezes, the scenery is frequent. Indeed, the rising sun shines, and swallows fly. Lightly, the smoke on the embankment of the Whampoa River dissipates. Go home. Savor the first news of spring tonight.</p>
<p>Du Wenkui and Zhou Jianhong's Scarlet Robe</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 12:15 AM to 1:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Spring Affection"</p>
<p>Spring paints the red building, parrots sing. Leaning on the curved railing, a beautiful woman. Her intelligent heart turns, her eyes fixed. Red clouds and peach cheeks, she thinks deeply. She knows herself to be a chaste and secluded woman. Reading "The West Chamber," she always learns from Shuangwen. Thoughts of love and romantic debts. Fragrant disappears and jade breaks before being cleared. Otherwise, ten thousand deaths will not be forgiven. She remembers the first meeting in the garden. Naturally. A handsome face and thin lips. He bound her heart. Suddenly forgetting the teachings of the family. Hiding your young lover in the boudoir. It can be called. Boundless scenery, a time of newness. Sometimes. Legs crossed sitting. Sometimes. Shoulders to shoulder walking. Sometimes, sharing a cup, joining hearts and talking. Sometimes she takes a puff of the scented cigarette. He takes. The remaining cigarette in his stomach. It's hard to describe this kind of love. Sometimes. She faces the treasure mirror at the dressing table. He and she. Rearrange the black clouds and insert the phoenix hairpin. Applying powder and adjusting rouge, everything is exquisite. Just like the young Zhou Lang, good at using troops. Unexpectedly retreating the women's army. If one must leave for a moment, parting for a short time. Nine turns and three returns, unable to bear to part. Butterflies love flowers, flowers love butterflies. You must pity me, I pity you. If there is no news for half a month. It will be like weaving a geometric brocade. Truly, your heart matches my heart.</p>

<p>Further Information</p>
<p>I, Bao Xuexue, have been using Wen Lu-jun since going to Nanjing (the following 18 characters are deleted). I heard that Mr. Zhou will return to Shanghai today to enjoy family happiness, or go to St. Helena for an all-night rave.</p>
<p>Although the name of the recent consultant Jiang Manli often appears in various broadcasting publications, her photos have been absent for a long time. There is a small photo taken by Jin Jiaxi and Qun in the first issue of "Chunse" Volume 2, titled: "Sandwiched in the middle." Is it, as shown in the photo, the meaning of being sandwiched between two branches? (Meaning)</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Jiang Manli went to Ningbo on the 28th to make a cameo appearance. Whether she jumped out of the "middle" or not, let's listen to the next episode.) The broadcasting industry of the "Citizen Daily" will expand its coverage on New Year's Day, including many literary works by Zhou Xuan, Xu Xuan, Xu Jian, and Xu Qi, as well as many photos of singers. (Editor's note: Is this a "electric" exchange of articles?)</p>
<p>Miss Zheng Xia said: "Those who call me the boss's wife are all enemies."</p>
<p>A Mi Mi is busy writing articles. (Editor's note: Another one!)</p>
<p>The ladies of the Lanman Art Society have been downcast these two days because the Shanghai Girls' High School's anniversary celebration will not be held.</p>
<p>Miss Bai Na has invited Mr. Wang Zhen to see a movie at the Grand Cathay on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Miss Bei Xia is the second Xu Qi.</p>
<p>The Yi Ming Society is broadcasting a special program, lacking the accompaniment of Fan Hualin.</p>
<p>Miss Liya said: "When I was studying at Dahe Girls' High School, I always ranked at the top of the boys."</p>
<p>Miss Xu Xuan's handkerchief was brought from Rome.</p>
<p>Miss Zheng Xia looks like a Wuxi big Ah Fu, her clothes are too fat! (Shanghai style)</p>
<p>The Weiyi Concert was founded by Yi Fan, Wang Qi, Xu Wei, Wang Shijun, Cai Maosheng, etc., and led by Fang Ronghua. It has been in preparation for two months and is of an amateur nature. It is also heard that the association will be broadcasting soon. The association's mailing address is No. 66, Xiaodongmen East Street, Nanshi. (Le Jun)</p>
<p>The "Silver Song" edited by Gan Nailiang of "Da Ribao" and the broadcasting world of "Citizen Daily" are the same.</p>
<p>Since Shiyin of Shangxue Society stopped broadcasting, Zhao Chao, who enjoyed the world of heaven and earth in the society, has disappeared.</p>
<p>Previously, "City That Never Sleeps" praised Chen Shaoping as a standard musician, and now there is another "Mengying" praising Zhou Mingyuan as a standard musician. I wonder which one is the standard musician?</p>
<p>New Year's Eve is coming soon, and we can once again see the Citizen Daily's supplement on the broadcasting world carrying the news of Zhou Mingyuan's wild dancing at ×× Dance Hall. (Crazy Monk: I have investigated that Mr. Zhou is someone who has never even pulled a rickshaw).</p>
<p>The broadcasting of Metropolitan Society and Chunxiao Troupe will end at the end of this month. In addition, the advertisement of Datong Society is still a problem.</p>
<p>Qingping Society, which will be broadcasting on China Radio from New Year's Day, is organized by Feng Han and Chen Hao, not Shao Chen. It is heard that Shao has already withdrawn.</p>
<p>The beautiful women Luo Ying and Ying of Qingping Society are a pair who are not in harmony on the surface. I am afraid that one of them will have to withdraw in the end.</p>
<p>The return of Li Ying to Qingping Society and Zhou Manli's return to Rose are somewhat related.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Suzhen, the director of the Mingmei Troupe, is often seen in various publications, but Mr. Mu Qiquan, the director of Mingmei, is not seen. It's a strange thing.</p>
<p>Miss Yuwen is Hanlin. It is heard that she has recently joined the Qingping Society. (Above by Crazy Monk)</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Two Blockbusters to Premiere on New Year's Eve in Paris</h3>
<p>The Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre will have a special screening starting at 11:15 PM on New Year's Eve, selected as "Complete Color Cartoon" and "The Count of Monte Cristo" to premiere at the same time. Ticket prices for upstairs and downstairs are two and four corners. The film "The Count of Monte Cristo" was included as a last chance for those who were unable to get tickets due to the crowds these days, as the film is about to be shipped to other cities.</p>
<h3>The Grand Cathay Shows "Little Caesar"</h3>
<p>James Cagney's latest masterpiece, "Little Caesar" (Frisco Kid), is a tense and exciting martial arts passion epic. Among the recent films starring Cagney, this one is the best, and supporting actors such as Glenda Farrell, Ricardo Cortez, and Lilyan Tashman are all outstanding talents, which adds a lot of color to the film. The film not only has rare and intense battles on the screen, but also the scene of burning down the bandit area, with the fire shining in the sky, which is particularly thrilling. It is now heard that the film has been scheduled to be screened day and night at Guangming today (New Year's Eve). The left is a scene from the film.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Ideology of "Triumphant Song"</h3>
<p>In the current situation where floods and droughts come one after another, and at a time when we are shouting to eradicate feudal remnants, "Triumphant Song" gives everyone a very alarming hint.</p>
<p>Although it only takes drought as its background, it actually wants to reveal the reasons for the entire so-called "natural disaster" and the real solution. We can see how feudal remnants spread by relying on the manipulation of unscrupulous gentry, and we can also see how the gentry use ignorant peasants to profit from the guise of disaster relief by initiating welcoming god gatherings. Those with a clear mind are regarded as rebels, and good methods cannot be implemented. This makes us know that the mutual use of local tyrants and evil gentry and feudal forces forms a situation where disasters become more serious. The good reputation of disasters is played out in a hypocritical game.</p>
<p>Director Bu Wancang seriously handled this serious subject matter. He used his sophisticated skills to grasp this perfect content and fully developed it, making it deeply imprinted in people's hearts. He used the chaotic crowd scenes to tension the plot, and the climax of finally opening up the river water due to "everyone's unity" is a noteworthy technique.</p>
<p>This film has now been scheduled to be screened at Jincheng on New Year's Day. We introduce it to the ladies of the country with respect and confidence!</p>
<h3>Snippets of News from Stars</h3>
<p>The garden scenery of "Peach Blossoms After the Calamity" has been destroyed by wind and rain for several days. There are as many as 24 scenes in the scenery. As soon as the weather clears, it will be repaired and reshot.</p>
<p>Wang Weixin is a soldier in "Love Letter." Wang recently ordered a set of woolen military uniforms and a pair of leather boots, which is said to have cost a lot.</p>
<p>Wu Cun took a small photo with two old bugs a few days ago. The old bugs were not afraid of Taiwan Liang and their expressions were natural. It is also a strange thing. (The photo will be published in the new issue of "Star Bi-Monthly".)</p>
<p>Butterfly married Gao Zhanfei in "Brothers Together" and had a boy after a month. Yesterday, when filming this scene, the sound of the child crying reached outside the venue. Everyone present showed a smile, and the atmosphere was extremely realistic.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of "Spring Flower" has been filmed, and the remaining are all outdoor scenes. It is expected to be completed by the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>There is an interlude in "Love Letter," sung by Ye Qiuxin. Ye practices very hard.</p>
<p>The work of the stars has been very tense recently. There are as many as four groups of plays being filmed at the same time. In addition to the Linqiao Sound Photography Studio, which is under construction, a glass shed is also being added to the side of the photography studio at the Erbert Road Factory to meet the needs of the application.</p>
